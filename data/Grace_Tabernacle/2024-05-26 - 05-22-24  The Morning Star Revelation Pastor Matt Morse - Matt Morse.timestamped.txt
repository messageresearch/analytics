[40:50] there and and I just uh been I love the
[40:54] word and I kind of got picked on after
[40:56] Wednesday night and some of the some of
[40:58] the ladies and and they heard me
[41:00] preaching said he's the only preacher I
[41:02] know that can print can plant fried okra
[41:06] it's like you I was wondering why
[41:07] everybody was laughing when I got
[41:08] talking about me and my wife planting
[41:10] fried ochre and they said well you you
[41:11] don't plant it fried you just plant okra
[41:13] and then when you get it if I ever
[41:15] figure out how to plant fried okra I'll
[41:16] be the richest man in the South some
[41:19] fried green tomatoes just put them in
[41:20] the ground they come out ready to eat I
[41:22] mean my goodness but uh that's that must
[41:25] been what it was like in whenever the
[41:27] children of Israel went on the
[41:29] Wilderness Journey just fried ochre and
[41:31] and fried green tomatoes all the time it
[41:33] was already ready I I think that's way
[41:35] it that's the way I want it just bring
[41:37] it to me already cooked amen you love
[41:39] the Lord this morning amen we just want
[41:41] to read out of the Book of Revelations
[41:43] the 22nd chapter the 14th verse the
[41:46] Bible said blessed are they that do his
[41:48] Commandments that they may have the
[41:49] right to the tree of life and may enter
[41:52] in through the gates into the city for
[41:55] without our dogs and sorcerers and
[41:57] whoremongers and murderers and idolators
[42:00] and whosoever loveth and maketh a lie
[42:03] but I Jesus have sent my angel to
[42:05] testify unto you these things in the
[42:07] churches and I am the root and The
[42:09] Offspring of David and the bright and
[42:11] The Morning Star and this morning as you
[42:14] take your seats I'd like to speak on the
[42:16] Morning Star
[42:18] Revelation now I've been speaking on
[42:20] This Book of Revelation for or or or on
[42:23] Revelation the last few Services it's
[42:25] just been something that's really been
[42:26] on my heart and uh we've been as we've
[42:28] been speaking on Revelation last Sunday
[42:31] uh we were showing how that it takes a
[42:32] revelation to receive any promise of God
[42:35] and uh so if you wanted to receive
[42:37] healing or salvation or whatever it
[42:39] might be it would all come uh by
[42:41] Revelation I know there's a challenge uh
[42:43] uh against that statement because the
[42:45] Bible says that it takes Faith to
[42:46] receive them and the Bible even says it
[42:48] was by Grace you're saved through faith
[42:50] and I believe that I believe that we're
[42:52] saved by faith I believe that our
[42:53] healing uh comes by faith but then it
[42:55] goes a little bit deeper because it
[42:57] takes something in order to have faith
[42:59] and see so you ask this question what
[43:01] does it take to have faith Paul says
[43:03] that that God deals to every man a
[43:05] Measure of Faith so we asked this
[43:07] question last Sunday as we were closing
[43:09] is how does God deal it the Bible says
[43:12] faith cometh by the hearing of the word
[43:14] of God so when a man can hear the word
[43:17] and he comes and he hears the the word
[43:18] being preached and then you catch a
[43:20] revelation of the word that's preached
[43:22] and then that Revelation that you've
[43:24] caught of the word that's being preached
[43:26] is what brings you faith and so that's
[43:28] why brother brm would make this
[43:29] statement he said faith is a revelation
[43:32] see you couldn't even have faith without
[43:34] Revelation therefore you couldn't be
[43:35] healed without Revelation you couldn't
[43:37] be saved without Revelation you couldn't
[43:39] you couldn't believe without Revelation
[43:41] but Market takes faith in order to have
[43:43] it he said what is Faith he said faith
[43:44] is something that's revealed to you that
[43:46] is not yet but you believe it will be
[43:49] see faith is the revelation of the will
[43:52] of God so it's all by Revelation so if
[43:54] you want to receive something from God
[43:56] it'll take a revelation if you want to
[43:57] receive a a promise of God it'll take a
[44:00] revelation if you want God to do
[44:01] something for you and you say brother
[44:02] Matt I want to be a real believer and I
[44:04] I want to believe every promise and I
[44:06] want to I want to be able to have
[44:07] healing I want to see uh hands laid on
[44:09] the sick and the sick recovery all these
[44:11] great things and and the whole world is
[44:13] trying to build up a great faith in
[44:15] order to receive the promise of God but
[44:16] the reality is what we need is a
[44:18] revelation of what faith is and we need
[44:21] a revelation of God's word and he said
[44:23] see it's by Revelation that's why
[44:24] brother B would say that more than
[44:26] anything else we ought to pray for
[44:27] Revelation how many believes that say
[44:29] Amen we ought to pray for Revelation he
[44:31] says see because when you have a true
[44:33] Revelation then you can't go wrong you
[44:35] see that when you have a true Revelation
[44:37] nobody can lead you astray and I I got
[44:39] to think about that what a true
[44:41] Revelation does you know brother Wesley
[44:43] when a person has a revelation of Divine
[44:45] Healing that's whenever you can see some
[44:47] that come through a prayer line and
[44:48] they're healed and then you could see a
[44:50] thousand people that come through a
[44:52] prayer line and nothing happened to them
[44:54] and they never receive their healing and
[44:55] it will never shake your faith and the
[44:57] reason it doesn't shake your faith is
[44:59] because your faith is not based on the
[45:01] outcome of a healing line it's because
[45:03] your faith was based on the revelation
[45:06] of the mercy of God of healing see
[45:07] because you have a revelation of healing
[45:09] and you have a a revelation of Divine
[45:11] Healing and then people aren't healed
[45:12] but you don't lose faith and people walk
[45:14] away the same and you don't lose Faith
[45:16] they keep the same symptoms you don't
[45:17] lose Faith because you realize your
[45:19] faith isn't based on symptoms it isn't
[45:21] based on their feelings it isn't isn't
[45:23] based on the failures of others or the
[45:25] faith of others or nothing like that but
[45:26] it's based on the revelation of Jesus
[45:29] Christ and it's the same way with
[45:30] salvation you ever you ever take a
[45:32] person and they'll get a revelation of
[45:34] what salvation really is then brother
[45:36] Wesley you know what happens Hypocrites
[45:38] don't change you anymore you know the I
[45:40] think the greatest thing that caus
[45:42] people to stop going to church brother
[45:43] Mark most of the time when they get
[45:45] backslid is they it's because they'll
[45:46] see somebody that is already backslid
[45:49] well I would go down there and go to
[45:50] church but you know half them people's
[45:51] Hypocrites anyway and you know I would
[45:53] go church but last time I went to church
[45:55] I seen so and so down there at Walmart
[45:57] my the way they were dressed and the way
[45:59] they were acting why if they were real
[46:01] Christians ain't none of them be like
[46:02] that but I'll tell you I'm just going to
[46:03] stay home any anyway but you realize
[46:06] what it is is when a person gets a
[46:07] revelation of Salvation then a hypocrite
[46:10] can't turn you away when you get a
[46:12] revelation of Salvation then somebody
[46:14] backslid and they can't turn you away
[46:15] they don't shake you anymore because you
[46:17] have a real Revelation and see so we
[46:20] find this is to be the case that having
[46:22] a real Revelation is what makes you a
[46:24] solid believer how many believe that
[46:26] having having a real Revelation makes
[46:28] you a real believer it gives you a
[46:30] foundation brother Mark upon the on the
[46:32] word of God it's what makes you come to
[46:34] church when you don't feel like it it's
[46:35] what makes you get up on Sunday morning
[46:37] when when everything's going wrong and
[46:39] the and the in the in the in the in the
[46:40] house is falling apart and the and
[46:42] everything's are wreck and you and your
[46:44] wife's in the middle of argument and all
[46:46] but but you look past it all and you go
[46:47] to church anyway because you have a
[46:49] revelation of of why it is that you
[46:51] serve God and a revelation of of your
[46:53] salvation that was given to you by grace
[46:55] and it was unmar brother Savor you there
[46:57] wasn't nothing you could do to earn it
[46:59] and that love for Christ and all that
[47:00] he's done for you it caused you to get
[47:02] out of bed and go sit on a church pew on
[47:04] Sunday morning it caus you to lift your
[47:06] hand it caus you to say Amen it it caus
[47:09] you to clap and to sing and and when
[47:11] you're tired and you don't feel like
[47:12] going to church oh but it caus you to
[47:14] get into the service why because you
[47:16] have a revelation of Salvation you have
[47:18] a revelation of what he done for you and
[47:21] and because of it you want to give
[47:22] something back to God and you want to
[47:24] let him know Lord I love you and I thank
[47:25] you and I Lord I I'm so grateful of all
[47:28] that you've done for me Lord so I come
[47:29] to give this time to you I thought i'
[47:31] give all week to my job and I I give all
[47:33] week to my to my family and I give all
[47:35] week to all these other things but this
[47:37] morning I come to give my time to you
[47:39] and Lord this morning I come to Worship
[47:41] You Lord this morning I've caught a
[47:43] revelation of who you are and what you
[47:45] done for me and I I come to lay down
[47:47] before you Lord this morning to give
[47:49] everything back that I can give see
[47:51] having a real Revelation is what makes
[47:53] you a solid believer that's why Jesus
[47:55] would say upon this rock I'll build my
[47:58] church isn't it something that God would
[48:00] send a revelation of Jesus Christ and
[48:02] that Revelation was a real Revelation it
[48:05] Ain it ain't just revelation
[48:07] of of the name but it's a revelation of
[48:09] who he really was and friends let me
[48:11] tell you with a real revelation of Jesus
[48:14] Christ you will see his authority over
[48:17] the dimension that you're living in I
[48:18] thought about this this morning you know
[48:20] it's easier to see Jesus having an
[48:22] authority over an unseen Dimension than
[48:25] it is for him to have an authority over
[48:26] the dimension we're living in you ever
[48:28] thought about that because God is an
[48:30] unseen God so we look at God of God
[48:32] being unseen and and it's easy for us to
[48:35] say well God can have dominion over the
[48:37] devil and God can have dominion over the
[48:40] over hell and God can have dominion over
[48:42] these principalities and God can have
[48:44] dominion over this Supernatural realm or
[48:47] or this other dimension or these things
[48:48] that we can't see see it's easy to see
[48:51] God or it's easy to see Jesus have power
[48:53] over those things but what it's hard to
[48:55] do is to see him have power over the
[48:58] things that are tangible it's hard to
[49:00] see him have power I know that's
[49:01] backwards away but but it's the truth
[49:03] it's hard to see him have power over
[49:05] things that you go through it's hard to
[49:07] see him have power over o over things
[49:09] that we that we're dealing with in this
[49:11] life but you realize it's easy to see in
[49:13] a spiritual realm he has power over
[49:15] Heavens power over things you can't see
[49:17] but brother Mark when you catch a real
[49:19] revelation of Jesus Christ then you
[49:22] catch a revelation that he has an
[49:24] authority over things that you can see
[49:27] Paul said he's above every principality
[49:29] and power and might in every Dominion in
[49:32] every name that is named not only in
[49:34] this world but also the world that the
[49:36] world that is to come you may tell you
[49:38] what that means it means that Christ has
[49:40] dominion over your problem this morning
[49:42] Christ has dominion over your home he
[49:44] has dominion over the family trouble he
[49:47] has dominion over the church and the
[49:48] church problems he has dominion over
[49:50] your health problems God don't just want
[49:52] to be a god of Heaven he don't just want
[49:54] to be a god of another world he don't
[49:56] just want to be a god of some spiritual
[49:58] realm but I thank God that we have a
[50:00] revelation of who Jesus Christ was and
[50:03] that he was sent to this earth to have
[50:04] dominion over natural things he was sent
[50:07] to have dominion over these flesh bodies
[50:09] and dominion over the problems and the
[50:11] trials that we face each and every day
[50:13] it's a real revelation of Jesus Christ
[50:16] you know I think sometimes is what it is
[50:18] is sometimes we get caught up watching
[50:20] all the destruction and and all the
[50:22] things that's going on in this world and
[50:24] we forget about the real outcome we we
[50:27] we get caught up in everything that's
[50:28] going on around us and we forget that
[50:30] there's something that God has promised
[50:32] us and and you know brother wesy we get
[50:34] troubled in our spirit and we get
[50:36] unsettled because things that's going on
[50:37] in the churches and and things that are
[50:39] other people are doing and because
[50:41] people are maybe people are are getting
[50:43] in their mind or they'll they'll leave
[50:44] away from the the the message or they'll
[50:46] go they'll go away from church or they
[50:48] they don't want to be around they don't
[50:49] want to Fellowship no more and we get
[50:50] all we get all wrapped up in it see our
[50:52] trouble our spirit gets troubled and and
[50:54] we get unsettled but you realize that
[50:56] we're that's not unordinary that's even
[50:59] the Prophet Daniel got into that place
[51:01] you you realize you remember when when
[51:02] Daniel had the dream he seen a dream of
[51:04] four beasts remember he said there they
[51:06] were four beasts that were beasts of
[51:08] power I'm not I'm not going to go
[51:09] through it this morning but but he said
[51:11] he said but then those beasts they were
[51:12] stripped of their power they were they
[51:14] were destroyed they were stripped of
[51:16] power they had their Dominion taken away
[51:18] and then and then he said this is what
[51:20] he saw in a dream he said but then I saw
[51:22] one that was like of the son of man that
[51:24] come from the clouds of Heaven as the an
[51:26] of days and they brought him near before
[51:28] him and there was given him dominion and
[51:31] glory and the kingdom that all people
[51:34] and Nations and languages should serve
[51:36] him and his Dominion is an everlasting
[51:39] Dominion you know what that means that
[51:41] it still lasts today his Dominion is an
[51:44] everlasting Dominion anybody hear me
[51:46] this morning his Dominion is an
[51:48] everlasting Dominion let the devil know
[51:50] it this morning his Dominion is an
[51:51] everlasting Dominion that means on
[51:53] Sunday morning right here in the middle
[51:55] of May and
[51:57] 2024 that the Dominion of this king is
[52:00] still
[52:00] Everlasting he said it's an everlasting
[52:03] dominion and it'll and there was given
[52:05] him dominion over every Kingdom and
[52:06] everlasting Dominion which shall not
[52:08] pass away and his kingdom shall not be
[52:10] destroyed but even after seeing this are
[52:12] you hearing me even after seeing this he
[52:14] saw the four beasts that would fall he
[52:16] saw this great one that would rise up
[52:19] that was likened under the son of man he
[52:21] saw Dominion that was given to him the
[52:23] Bible said but even then Daniel said but
[52:25] I'm grieved in my
[52:27] Spirit I'm grieved in my spirit because
[52:29] I don't understand what it meant I'm
[52:31] grieved in my spirit because I don't
[52:33] know what these beasts really were and
[52:35] I'm grieved in my spirit because I
[52:38] because I was troubled about it because
[52:39] I didn't really have a revelation of it
[52:42] and so what did he do brother marah is
[52:43] Daniel goes down you say why why why
[52:45] would he be grieved because he had a
[52:47] great dream but he had no Revelation So
[52:49] Daniel said so in the dream he goes down
[52:51] to one of them was standing in the crowd
[52:53] and Daniel asked them he said what is
[52:55] the truth of all all this he said so the
[52:57] man made known unto me he said the four
[53:00] beasts were Four Kings which shall arise
[53:02] out of the earth he said but the other
[53:04] when the when you saw the Dominion come
[53:06] he said that was the Saints of the most
[53:08] high God that shall come and take the
[53:11] kingdom and possess the kingdom forever
[53:13] and ever and ever oh I thank God that
[53:16] there came somebody that would give a
[53:18] revelation that it wasn't just God it
[53:20] wasn't just to God out of Heaven that
[53:22] Jesus didn't come just to have dominion
[53:24] for himself but he said he made it known
[53:26] to me that the saints of God would have
[53:28] dominion upon the Earth he made it known
[53:31] unto me that the saints of God it it
[53:33] wasn't just yesterday but forever and
[53:36] ever and forever and ever they'll have
[53:38] dominion upon the Earth said the saint
[53:41] shall take his kingdom GL that makes me
[53:43] want to preach this morning that's why
[53:46] Paul said he said Christ is the head and
[53:48] church and the church is the body and he
[53:50] has put all things under his feet you
[53:53] know what that means brother Mah if the
[53:54] bo if the church is the body body of
[53:57] Jesus Christ and all things are under
[53:59] his feet then the things are under the
[54:02] feet of the body the Feet's the lowest
[54:03] thing on the body so that means it
[54:05] doesn't matter what is ever brought up
[54:07] or what what the devil Rises up it's
[54:09] under the feet of the Bride of Jesus
[54:11] Christ because you're the body of Jesus
[54:13] see it takes a true revelation of the
[54:15] Dominion of Jesus Christ that's what
[54:18] we're looking for this morning let me
[54:19] tell you they tell him like he's a story
[54:21] they tell him like it's some story book
[54:23] but friends let me let me tell you this
[54:25] morning that Jesus Christ is not some
[54:27] fictional character he he's not some guy
[54:29] in a story he's the king of glory he
[54:32] ain't just something that was made up to
[54:33] make you feel good in the middle of the
[54:35] night but it was Jesus Christ the son of
[54:37] God that came down to the Earth that
[54:39] shed his blood that would give dominion
[54:41] and power to the church over every devil
[54:44] that they had faced in the age that
[54:45] we're living
[54:47] in you say brother Matt well how do you
[54:49] get that Revelation well let me tell you
[54:50] what Paul said he said no man can say
[54:53] that Jesus is Lord but by the Holy Ghost
[54:56] man there's a little freebie for the
[54:57] trinitarians out there you know one
[55:00] place Jesus told Peter he said you you
[55:02] didn't get that Revelation from man but
[55:04] you got it from God Paul says we get it
[55:06] from pet or Jesus said you get it from
[55:08] the Father Paul said you get it from the
[55:10] Holy Ghost well either either one of
[55:12] them is wrong or there's both
[55:14] right but what was it it's a holy ghost
[55:17] Revelation that's what we need this
[55:19] morning that's what the church is need
[55:21] it's a holy ghost Revelation but Mark
[55:23] it's not a head knowledge it's a it's a
[55:25] holy ghost it's a reveal he thing of God
[55:27] that come from the come from the spirit
[55:29] of God a real Revelation that can that's
[55:32] not in the head of a man but it's in the
[55:33] soul of a man it's something that sinks
[55:36] down into your heart that that causes
[55:38] you to be able to stand it don't matter
[55:39] what comes at you or what waves or what
[55:42] or how rocky that it gets but because
[55:44] there's a real Revelation it'll always
[55:46] stand friends I thank God for it this
[55:48] morning how many how many believes that
[55:50] how many how many thank God for it you
[55:52] say I thank God for the supernatural
[55:54] spirit of God you realize it was a prom
[55:56] Pro of God in the Bible brother Wesley
[55:58] said the Bible the bible promises that
[56:00] that that that the the Holy Ghost would
[56:01] come to them it would be a down payment
[56:03] for your inheritance it's just a little
[56:05] portion of what God's going to give you
[56:07] but it'll have the same power just to
[56:09] show you that that God can redeem these
[56:11] bodies he can take a man that's in sin a
[56:13] man that that's dead in his trespasses
[56:15] and he can bring him back to life the
[56:17] Bible said what would it do it would
[56:19] Quicken him to life it would make him
[56:20] live again listen Paul said because they
[56:23] were dead but it brought them to life no
[56:24] wonder Satan hates revelation
[56:26] because it brings the church to Life by
[56:29] the power of the Holy Ghost no wonder he
[56:31] hates Revelation it'll take somebody
[56:33] that was dead that can barely come to
[56:35] church and it'll put a Zeal in their
[56:37] heart to want to serve God it'll put the
[56:39] praise of God on their lips for theor
[56:41] and it'll give them a foundation to
[56:43] stand upon that the devil can't shake he
[56:46] can't run them out of church he can't
[56:47] run he can't shake you out of church he
[56:50] couldn't he couldn't lead you out of
[56:51] church he couldn't entice you out of
[56:53] church he couldn't Force you out of
[56:54] church he couldn't get you out brother
[56:56] Mark because you have a
[56:58] revelation my may be simple this morning
[57:01] but it's the truth we have a revelation
[57:03] that came from God that's why Satan
[57:05] hates it why because it it's it brings
[57:07] the church to life see when you
[57:10] recognize that you are the body of Jesus
[57:12] Christ catch this simple thought
[57:14] powerful Revelation when you recognize
[57:16] that you are the body of Jesus Christ
[57:19] and your hands are his hands and your
[57:21] feet are his feet listen somebody and
[57:23] you speak the words you speak are as
[57:26] Jesus would speak them then that
[57:28] Revelation can take one man and give him
[57:30] enough power to conquer every devil in
[57:32] hell brother Charles you ever catch a
[57:34] hold of that that I am the body of Jesus
[57:37] Christ then no devil will ever be able
[57:38] to stand before you I'm the body of
[57:41] Jesus Christ he'll never have authority
[57:43] over you I'm the body of Jesus Christ
[57:45] he'll never be able to put you down
[57:47] again because the same one that walked
[57:49] upon the Earth the one that walked the
[57:51] shores of Galilee is walking in human
[57:53] flesh this morning it'll conquer every
[57:56] devil in hell that's why brother B said
[57:58] he he said he knows that if the people
[58:00] ever get a true revelation of the true
[58:02] church and what she is and what she
[58:05] stands for that she can do the Greater
[58:07] Works she will be an invincible Army
[58:11] he's talking about
[58:13] you if the church ever gets a true
[58:15] revelation of who she is what she stands
[58:18] for think about it she'll be an
[58:20] invincible Army how many knows what
[58:22] Invincible means it means you're too
[58:24] powerful to be defeated
[58:27] man is't that good a revelation that can
[58:30] make you so powerful brother Mark that
[58:32] the devil don't know what to do with you
[58:35] too powerful to be defeated so when the
[58:38] Devil Comes you know what you do you
[58:39] turn around I heard brother Mark trying
[58:41] to do it this morning but you turn
[58:42] around you say Satan I'm too powerful to
[58:45] be defeated how many say that this
[58:47] morning I'm too powerful to be defeated

[58:52] powerful to be defeated it's okay to
[58:54] repeat I'm too powerful ful to be
[58:56] defeated somebody say it like you're
[58:58] meaning I'm too powerful to be defeated
[59:01] want somebody put your shoulders back
[59:02] and stand up and look the devil in the
[59:03] eye and say I'm too powerful to be
[59:06] defeated let me tell you friend this is
[59:07] Grace Tabernacle this ain't some Baptist
[59:09] Church down the road where people don't

[59:18] defeated we come to have church we come
[59:21] to obey the word of God we come to

[59:25] to follow the move with the spirit you
[59:27] say but Matt why are you so bold let me
[59:29] tell you cuz Revelation empowers you
[59:32] Revelation it strengthens you it causes
[59:34] you to be able to stand upon your feet
[59:36] and stand against the devil and look man
[59:38] you people are afraid to say it I'm too
[59:40] powerful to be defeated cuz the devil's
[59:42] convinced you that you ain't got no
[59:44] power he's convinced you that you'll
[59:45] never overcome he's convinced you that
[59:47] you're worthless and you're cast out and
[59:49] you're run down and you're an outcast
[59:51] but let me tell you look him in the eye

[1:00:02] I'm too powerful to be defeated well let
[1:00:05] me tell you what happens when Revelation
[1:00:07] strikes a man it was the Revelation that
[1:00:09] enabled David to stand before that Giant
[1:00:12] Goliath you say brother Matt it was a
[1:00:14] revelation sure it was remember when
[1:00:16] David went down to Goliath you realize
[1:00:18] that David was living under a covenant
[1:00:20] that God had given to Abraham and so
[1:00:23] because of this Covenant that God had
[1:00:25] made when David stood before them you
[1:00:27] remember the Covenant remember when he
[1:00:28] told Abraham he said have he said keep
[1:00:31] this Covenant between you and me and
[1:00:32] your seed he said every Manchild among
[1:00:35] you shall be circumcised and in that
[1:00:37] Covenant he said I will bless them that
[1:00:39] bless you I will curse them that curse
[1:00:42] you and then when they entered into a
[1:00:45] battle brother Mark you can find it in
[1:00:46] the book of Deuteronomy when they
[1:00:47] entered into a battle here when they
[1:00:49] went down into this battle with Goliath
[1:00:51] they had forgotten This Promise from God
[1:00:54] but when they went enter into a battle
[1:00:56] God had given them an order to say these
[1:00:58] words he said when you go into a battle
[1:01:00] he said have a priest come up before the
[1:01:02] people and speak to the people before
[1:01:04] you go into battle and the priest shall
[1:01:06] say here oh Israel approach this day
[1:01:08] under battle against your enemies let
[1:01:10] not your hearts faint fear not do not
[1:01:14] tremble neither be you terrified because
[1:01:16] of them for the Lord your God is he that
[1:01:18] goeth with you to fight for you against
[1:01:21] your enemies to save you he said send a
[1:01:24] priest before the people before they go
[1:01:26] into battle and speak those words
[1:01:29] friends I thank God that there's still
[1:01:31] some god- calleded men that when you're
[1:01:33] heading into a battle that they don't
[1:01:35] care to stand before the people of God
[1:01:37] and they say you approach this day under
[1:01:39] battle against your enemy and but let
[1:01:42] your heart not faint fear not do not
[1:01:45] tremble neither be you terrified because
[1:01:48] of them for the Lord your God is he that
[1:01:50] goeth with you to fight for you against
[1:01:53] your enemies and to save you see it was
[1:01:56] a it was a part of the Covenant that
[1:01:57] David had let me tell you what he did
[1:01:59] Brother Mah he took the revelation of
[1:02:01] the word of God and that Covenant that
[1:02:04] was made by God through circumcision and
[1:02:06] he stood by Revelation and he asked this
[1:02:09] question who is this uncircumcised
[1:02:12] Philistine that he should defy the
[1:02:14] armies of the Living God brother brother
[1:02:16] Wesley he had enough about him to know
[1:02:18] what the word of God required that he
[1:02:20] knew he had met God's requirements and
[1:02:22] he knew that Goliath hadn't he said
[1:02:24] who's this uncircumcised woman that
[1:02:26] would come and stand before me when I'm
[1:02:28] living under the Covenant that God gave
[1:02:30] to Abraham I've met God's requirement
[1:02:32] I've done all that God asked me to do
[1:02:34] and he gave me a promise let me tell you
[1:02:36] friends it's what gave him the right to
[1:02:38] stand before Goliath it wasn't the
[1:02:40] valley of Elum that he was stand or ELO
[1:02:42] that he was standing on it wasn't the
[1:02:44] power of King Saul that he was standing
[1:02:45] on it it wasn't the might or the power
[1:02:48] or the ability or the strength of the
[1:02:50] Israel army but he was standing on the
[1:02:53] revelation of the Covenant of almighty
[1:02:55] God
[1:02:56] because he had a revelation of the
[1:02:58] Covenant he could stand before Goliath
[1:03:00] what boldness that it gave him who art
[1:03:02] thou uncircumcised Philistine what give
[1:03:06] a little boy the the brother Mark the
[1:03:08] the courage to be able to stand before a
[1:03:10] great Giant and say who art thou you
[1:03:12] uncircumcised Philistine he knew he
[1:03:14] hadn't met God's requirement but David
[1:03:17] knew that he had see it was a revelation
[1:03:20] of God's covenant let me tell you
[1:03:22] friends because he had that kind of
[1:03:24] Revelation when he got down can I preach
[1:03:26] a minute I won't hold you long but when
[1:03:28] he got down on that Battlefield brother
[1:03:29] Mark you know what he done he got down
[1:03:31] there and guess what happened first
[1:03:33] thing out of Goliath's mouth the Bible
[1:03:34] says Goliath be to curse David by his
[1:03:37] own Gods let me tell you you know what
[1:03:38] happened when Goliath cursed David when
[1:03:40] he cursed everybody else you know what
[1:03:42] they did brother Joe they cared down in
[1:03:43] their tents when he cursed everybody
[1:03:45] else they went in hiding when he cursed
[1:03:47] everybody else they went over behind
[1:03:49] King Saul and said oh King can you help
[1:03:51] us some way but when he cursed David
[1:03:53] David just started dancing oh thank God
[1:03:55] oh why you dancing David oh don't you
[1:03:57] hear it I got a covenant with God he
[1:03:59] said I'll bless them that bless you I'll
[1:04:02] curse them that curse you he said curse
[1:04:04] on devil do your
[1:04:06] worst he danced oh I could just see him
[1:04:08] dancing on the battlefield oh David why
[1:04:11] you dancing oh God did you hear what the
[1:04:13] giant said about me he said I'll never
[1:04:15] make it he said I'll never be filled
[1:04:17] with the Holy Ghost he said I'll never
[1:04:19] be right with God he said I'll never
[1:04:21] make a Rapture he said I'll never make
[1:04:23] it home he said I'll never be a believer
[1:04:26] oh I thank God for the curse of the
[1:04:28] devil cuz you said Every curse he puts
[1:04:30] on me you'll bring back on
[1:04:33] him that's why we all look at the Devil
[1:04:35] say it louder devil you'll never have a
[1:04:38] church say it louder ain't nobody ever
[1:04:40] going to go say it louder you're too old
[1:04:42] to start preaching say it louder you
[1:04:45] never get the Holy Ghost say it louder
[1:04:47] your pastor's going to haunt you say it
[1:04:50] louder say it
[1:04:52] louder why you dancing I have a covenant
[1:04:55] with God
[1:04:56] he said I'll bless them that bless you
[1:04:58] and the curse you put on me will come
[1:05:00] back on you why he had a covenant had a
[1:05:04] revelation of the Covenant that God gave
[1:05:06] him see Revelation is what allows you to
[1:05:08] stand let me ask you what it was how did
[1:05:12] Moses how did Moses stand in the in the
[1:05:16] Palace of pharaoh see it was a
[1:05:18] revelation that he received at the
[1:05:20] burning bush but Mark when he went down
[1:05:22] this Revelation was so powerful that it
[1:05:25] caused a man an old
[1:05:27] man he caused an old wasn't too old but
[1:05:32] he caused this young man Moses to stand
[1:05:36] when he stood there at this Burning Bush
[1:05:38] but Mark it caused him to have the
[1:05:41] confidence to go stand before an entire
[1:05:43] nation of people and to speak the word
[1:05:46] of God knowing they had in they had
[1:05:48] swords any one of them could have took
[1:05:50] his life but but he had a revelation
[1:05:52] from God brother Bobby what was it that
[1:05:54] gave it to him I don't have to go
[1:05:55] through the whole story you know it but
[1:05:56] the Bible says but watch the Revelation
[1:05:59] came his Revelation came it was a real
[1:06:01] Holy Ghost experience see what what was
[1:06:03] all included there was a pillar of fire
[1:06:05] there was signs and wonders here he had
[1:06:08] done one sign then he done another sign
[1:06:09] remember God he told him he said if they
[1:06:11] don't believe the the the voice of the
[1:06:12] first sign they'll believe the voice of
[1:06:13] the second so here God not only does he
[1:06:15] show him a sign he says that sh that
[1:06:17] sign is going to speak on your behalf
[1:06:19] when you don't have the words to say let
[1:06:21] the sign speak when you can't defend
[1:06:23] yourself let the sign speak when you
[1:06:25] when you you can't work your way out of
[1:06:26] it let the sign speak when they wrap you
[1:06:28] up in scripture and because of your own
[1:06:29] failure of understanding just let the
[1:06:31] sign do the speaking say see they'll
[1:06:34] believe the voice of the sign you you
[1:06:36] realize what happened brother Mark is
[1:06:37] that whenever he got it he he got a
[1:06:40] revelation of his calling and brother
[1:06:42] bam said then then he went down because
[1:06:44] he had a revelation of what God had
[1:06:45] called him to do he said but that don't
[1:06:47] just go for Moses that goes for any man
[1:06:48] or woman hello somebody that goes for
[1:06:51] any man he said any man or woman that's
[1:06:53] ever been in the backside of the desert
[1:06:54] like Moses was and the revelation of God
[1:06:56] made manifest to him through the Holy
[1:06:58] Ghost there ain't nothing that can shake
[1:07:00] him when you get alone with God and let
[1:07:03] the revelation of God strike your heart
[1:07:05] there ain't nothing can shake him I can
[1:07:07] say this there ain't nothing can shake
[1:07:08] her either man or woman there ain't
[1:07:11] nothing can shake your what causes these
[1:07:13] young girls to be able to stand up in
[1:07:14] this world and be able to be Believers
[1:07:16] and go on when everybody else says well
[1:07:18] that ain't what pretty is let me show
[1:07:20] you what pretty is but they don't they
[1:07:21] don't fall for it they still hold a a
[1:07:23] standard of Holiness and and stand in in
[1:07:25] in the in the in the picture of the
[1:07:27] beauty of what what God called beautiful
[1:07:29] and and what any godall man would call
[1:07:31] beautiful and and they stand on it why
[1:07:33] brother Mark because they met God face
[1:07:35] to face they c a revelation of the word
[1:07:37] of God there ain't nothing can shake
[1:07:39] them it's no wonder that Paul wanted the
[1:07:43] church to have Revelation you see that
[1:07:45] it's no wonder he said matter of fact in
[1:07:47] the end of the Bible the is a whole book
[1:07:50] just on Revelation it was the revelation
[1:07:52] of Jesus Christ and it brother man say
[1:07:55] who was it the Bible said it he said he
[1:07:56] was the bright and The Morning Star but
[1:07:59] said and that morning star is with us
[1:08:01] tonight is there in this morning star it
[1:08:04] shines brighter than any other star in
[1:08:06] the morning isn't that something here he
[1:08:08] would say he's with us tonight I thought
[1:08:10] I thought about how he's with us tonight
[1:08:12] and you realize there was many
[1:08:13] Ministries there's many stars that that
[1:08:15] were shining there there's many stars
[1:08:17] that are shining today that will attract
[1:08:19] people to their life but you realize he
[1:08:21] said but the Morning Star will outshine
[1:08:23] them all there's many great lights in
[1:08:25] this world but the Morning Star will
[1:08:27] outshine them all and he came for a
[1:08:29] purpose you said well what was the
[1:08:30] purpose of the Morning Star he said he
[1:08:32] come to reflect the presence of the
[1:08:34] coming son you see what he was showing
[1:08:36] he was showing us is that the son that
[1:08:38] was coming was already here he said he
[1:08:40] was here in spirit he's come to reflect
[1:08:42] the presence of what would be a coming
[1:08:45] son so here standing in his presence he
[1:08:47] would reveal truth standing in his repr
[1:08:49] presence he would reveal Hearts what was
[1:08:51] it it was the very it was the very
[1:08:53] Morning Star it it was the it was Jesus
[1:08:55] Christ the lord of Glory that came and
[1:08:57] took the word of God and begin to reveal
[1:09:00] it to the hearts of people you you
[1:09:01] realize that there in the in this time
[1:09:03] there was there was crowds of people
[1:09:05] that were for 1900 years had looked at
[1:09:08] this book of Revelation as a book of
[1:09:09] mystery but you realize that this
[1:09:11] morning that we don't look at it that
[1:09:13] way anymore but we look at it as an open
[1:09:15] book this and that's the Revelation that
[1:09:17] Satan hates brother Mark he don't want
[1:09:18] you seeing that as an open book he don't
[1:09:20] want you knowing you're living in leot
[1:09:22] deia he don't want you seeing that that
[1:09:24] it's an age of lukewarmness he don't
[1:09:25] want you see that we're in the end time
[1:09:27] or or that we're living in the time of
[1:09:29] judgment but Satan's purpose is that
[1:09:31] every soul would meet his fate so
[1:09:34] brother Wesley what he does is he brings
[1:09:36] destruction and lies and he Bluffs and
[1:09:38] he he brings deceits and and and all
[1:09:40] these things upon on the people of God
[1:09:42] to keep you from catching a revelation
[1:09:44] the true revelation of Jesus Christ but
[1:09:46] what God does is God comes and he
[1:09:48] exposes the battle plan of Satan so
[1:09:51] before any of us was ever born here God
[1:09:53] had already purposed that Satan is going
[1:09:55] to do this he'll destroy he'll lie he'll
[1:09:57] deceive he said but what I'm going to do
[1:09:59] this is the age for it that you're going
[1:10:01] to thank God here here's where we are
[1:10:03] this is the time we we we didn't choose
[1:10:05] it brother Wesley but here we are he
[1:10:06] said but here I'm going to come and I'm
[1:10:08] going to expose the plan of the devil
[1:10:10] you said well how did he expose it he
[1:10:11] exposed it by fulfilling Malachi 4 and5
[1:10:15] and sending the spirit of Prophecy to
[1:10:17] our generation how many believes that
[1:10:19] but manam said see he said through these
[1:10:20] Church ages there's a great mess up that
[1:10:22] comes along but at the end of the church
[1:10:25] age the seventh Angel's message is to
[1:10:27] pick up these lost Mysteries and give it
[1:10:29] to the church now we notice that you you
[1:10:31] realize that that the purpose of the
[1:10:33] seventh angel was to take the Mysteries
[1:10:35] that were lost and give it to the church
[1:10:37] that's why when John when he saw the
[1:10:38] Throne of God you realize when he saw
[1:10:40] this Throne that there was a sealed book
[1:10:42] in his hand and John said you you and
[1:10:45] and when John would write about the
[1:10:46] first seal being open he would talk
[1:10:48] about the white horse rider remember the
[1:10:50] first seal he said when it was opened up
[1:10:51] there was one that was riding on a white
[1:10:53] horse butam said there was a mystery
[1:10:55] that goes with that riter see the world
[1:10:57] today and in matter of fact he said this
[1:10:59] mystery would be revealed to the entire
[1:11:02] world one day brother Joe the whole
[1:11:03] world will see it one day it'll be shown
[1:11:05] to the world who this white horse rider
[1:11:07] really is he said but it'll only be
[1:11:09] revealed to them after the lamb leaves
[1:11:11] the father's throne and his anaccessory
[1:11:13] as kinsman redeemer is over well friends
[1:11:15] I got news for you I don't wait I don't
[1:11:17] want to wait until then to get a
[1:11:19] revelation of who the white horse rider
[1:11:21] is I don't want to wait till then to
[1:11:22] catch the revelation of this Spirit
[1:11:24] that's moving across the land today but
[1:11:26] I say oh God by your grace and mercy may
[1:11:29] we catch it right now see the world
[1:11:32] they'll catch it one day it'll be
[1:11:33] revealed to them but for us here comes
[1:11:35] this morning star in the middle of of
[1:11:38] this book brother marah and it begins to
[1:11:40] shed light upon the on the mysteries of
[1:11:42] God to be able to show to the Bride of
[1:11:44] Jesus Christ Paul said that your eyes
[1:11:46] would be enlightened that they would
[1:11:47] come open to the very Mysteries that God
[1:11:50] has placed in the Bible that Christ The
[1:11:52] Living Jesus Christ should dwell in
[1:11:54] humanity again
[1:11:56] now brother man said now now I want you
[1:11:57] to notice this he said this ain't for
[1:11:59] everybody hello that's just the case he
[1:12:02] said but he said you know and then he
[1:12:04] say he gives every Pastor the r I'm
[1:12:06] going to go ahead and take my Liberty
[1:12:06] this morning he gives every Pastor the r
[1:12:09] he says so you know what you you out
[1:12:10] there you churches and pastors he said
[1:12:12] you can speak whatever you want to
[1:12:14] you've got a right by your own
[1:12:15] conviction to speak what you want to and
[1:12:17] if a minister don't want this amongst
[1:12:19] his people well then he don't have to
[1:12:20] take it to them he said but this is
[1:12:22] meant to be among the people that I have
[1:12:25] been sent to speak to therefore I must
[1:12:27] reveal what is truth now a't that good
[1:12:30] brother Mah so the Revelation was sent
[1:12:32] to whom the prophet was sent the
[1:12:34] Revelation wasn't sent to everybody it
[1:12:35] was sent to the ones that the prophet
[1:12:37] was sent to and he wasn't sent to all
[1:12:39] the churches he hello he wasn't sent to
[1:12:41] the Nations he wasn't sent to all the
[1:12:43] organizations he wasn't sent to the
[1:12:45] millions that came to his meeting but he
[1:12:48] was sent to those that had heard his
[1:12:50] message as individuals that's what
[1:12:52] Malachi said he said behold I send unto
[1:12:55] you Elijah the prophet he didn't come to
[1:12:57] save the whole world he came to save
[1:12:59] individuals that would see the light
[1:13:01] from The Morning Star shining upon the
[1:13:03] word of God and it would reflect
[1:13:05] something that was true and it would
[1:13:06] strike something in their heart brother
[1:13:08] Mark said I send to you see we know
[1:13:11] because of what Jesus said that this was
[1:13:14] not the man Elijah he said I'll send
[1:13:16] unto you Elijah the prophet can I take
[1:13:17] just a minute here I know this is being
[1:13:19] recorded and we have a lot of people
[1:13:21] that watch these but you realize that
[1:13:23] that that this was not that that that
[1:13:25] whenever Malachi made this prophecy he
[1:13:26] was not talking about the man Elijah we
[1:13:28] know that's Elementary but he was
[1:13:30] talking about the spirit of Elijah
[1:13:32] matter of fact it was the spirit of God
[1:13:33] that was upon Elijah it was God that
[1:13:35] gave Elijah that he had to get that
[1:13:37] Spirit from somewhere before Elijah ever
[1:13:38] even existed but here the spirit was on
[1:13:40] Elijah that same Spirit of Elijah Came
[1:13:43] Upon Elisha remember that was the second
[1:13:45] coming then John the Baptist Jesus said
[1:13:47] he came in John the Baptist then melachi
[1:13:49] 4 said before the the coming of the
[1:13:51] great and Dreadful day of the Lord
[1:13:53] before the Earth shall burn brother Mark
[1:13:55] or or or burn as fire and hay and
[1:13:57] stubble here this Spirit would come
[1:13:59] again and then again at the end of The
[1:14:00] Book of Revelation you find Moses and
[1:14:02] Elijah that are that are in in the in
[1:14:04] that great City remember the Bible said
[1:14:06] they had see them dead for for for I
[1:14:08] believe three days but they seen them
[1:14:09] laying there before they came back to Al
[1:14:11] and so we see this this is not the man
[1:14:13] Elijah but it's the spirit of the
[1:14:15] Prophet Elijah so many dismissed this
[1:14:18] they dismiss this word Prophet they they
[1:14:20] I thought brother Robert said it really
[1:14:22] well the other day we was eating dinner
[1:14:23] he said you know for a person that say I
[1:14:25] don't believe in a prophet he said
[1:14:26] according to my Bible they may as well
[1:14:28] just go around saying I don't believe in
[1:14:29] pastors I don't believe in evangelist I
[1:14:32] don't believe in teachers I don't he
[1:14:33] said he said because the the the the the
[1:14:35] office of the pastor came from the same
[1:14:37] place the office of the Prophet came
[1:14:38] from Ephesians the 4th chapter Paul said
[1:14:40] he called some pastors and apostles and
[1:14:42] evangelists and teachers and Prophets
[1:14:44] for the perfecting of the Saints for the
[1:14:46] preaching of the word of God you see so
[1:14:49] so here here God send it for this reason
[1:14:51] he said but notice whenever the prophet
[1:14:53] came brother Mark in the opening dark am
[1:14:55] I too late in the I'm just getting here
[1:14:57] in the opening of The Seven Seals
[1:14:59] brother Jared you find out in Revelation
[1:15:01] the fifth chapter now now you know what
[1:15:03] what the seals were open I know we we've
[1:15:04] done studies on this but but maybe some
[1:15:07] are are newer but but that you realize
[1:15:08] that this book that John saw in
[1:15:10] Revelations 5 was the book of redemption
[1:15:12] he knew what he knew what was the book
[1:15:14] because it bothered him that it wasn't
[1:15:15] open he knew something about it enough
[1:15:17] that it troubled him that it was a
[1:15:18] sealed book and so when he saw this he
[1:15:21] but but but he said I was I was troubled
[1:15:23] and and he wept but all of a sudden here
[1:15:25] come one of the elders that turned to
[1:15:26] him and said weep not John and he said
[1:15:28] here one has prevailed to open the book
[1:15:30] and to loose the seals of the book and
[1:15:32] so whenever John would turn he sees this
[1:15:34] you realize that John sees this as a
[1:15:36] future prophecy in other words one day
[1:15:38] it would happen in other words it did
[1:15:40] not happen in front of John it was just
[1:15:43] a vision that John saw John didn't see
[1:15:45] the seals open off the book and have a
[1:15:47] revelation of what it was it was a
[1:15:48] vision John didn't even understand the
[1:15:50] things that were being unfolded he said
[1:15:52] but he wrote them because that's what he
[1:15:54] told him to write but he didn't have a
[1:15:55] full understanding of this but it was a
[1:15:57] vision say see so as as he but as he
[1:16:00] shows this this this uh these seals
[1:16:02] being open remember it was a sealed book
[1:16:04] and the Bible said then in Revelation
[1:16:05] six the the he the lamb came and he took
[1:16:08] a hold of the book that was sealed and
[1:16:09] he began to remove the seals off the
[1:16:11] book now remember what happened when the
[1:16:13] first seal was open at at the uh when it
[1:16:16] got ready you realize that the White
[1:16:18] Horse the white horse rider has been
[1:16:19] preached and still is today and there's
[1:16:21] a lot of confusion that surrounds it
[1:16:23] that it's been preached as Christ and
[1:16:26] and and it's for good reason it's
[1:16:27] because without a revelation it appears
[1:16:29] that way because the the Bible said in
[1:16:31] Revelation 6 in the opening of the first
[1:16:33] seal it says I saw Behold a white horse
[1:16:35] and he that set up on him had a bow a
[1:16:37] crown was given to him he went forth
[1:16:39] conquering and to conquer looks like a
[1:16:41] great man well it looks the same as
[1:16:43] Revelations 19 and 11 he said and I saw
[1:16:46] heaven open and behold a White Horse He
[1:16:48] that set upon him was called faithful
[1:16:50] and true and and in righteousness he
[1:16:52] does judge and make war now how many
[1:16:54] realizes that Jesus Christ it was Christ
[1:16:56] sitting upon a white horse in
[1:16:58] righteousness he judge and make war he
[1:17:00] was called faithful and truth but
[1:17:01] realize Revelation 6 he was sitting on a
[1:17:03] white horse he went forth conquering he
[1:17:05] was given a crown and he had a bow you
[1:17:07] realize see brother Mark he looked so
[1:17:09] close to what Christ at the church well
[1:17:11] today uh but I know there's some kind of
[1:17:13] coming out of it now but but many uh uh
[1:17:15] the most still say today well that was
[1:17:17] Christ and he come in power and it came
[1:17:19] forth to conqueror or it was somebody
[1:17:21] that God had anointed to come forth to
[1:17:23] conqueror to set things in order water
[1:17:25] but you realize that that when a Prophet
[1:17:27] come and he took this he made it plain
[1:17:29] he said this was not Christ it was the
[1:17:31] Antichrist because he had a bow and no
[1:17:33] arrows he was a bluff he just see so he
[1:17:36] takes these seals brother Mar and he
[1:17:38] actually goes and he starts to show you
[1:17:40] where they are and show you who we are
[1:17:42] and by the Fulfillment of what Jesus
[1:17:44] said to the disciples remember Matthew
[1:17:46] 24 remember what the question was he
[1:17:48] said what is the sign of the end that's
[1:17:51] what that they asked Jesus and Jesus
[1:17:53] says to them what's what's he say he
[1:17:55] said as they sat there they said what
[1:17:56] will the end be what are the signs of
[1:17:57] the coming what is the end of the world
[1:17:59] the first thing Jesus said to them he
[1:18:01] said take heed that no man deceive you
[1:18:03] this is how Jesus answers he said for
[1:18:05] many shall come in my name saying I am
[1:18:07] Christ and shall deceive many now watch
[1:18:10] this in Matthew 24 the first thing Jesus
[1:18:13] would say would happen they will come
[1:18:14] and say I am Christ and shall deceive
[1:18:16] many now watch when the seal comes off
[1:18:18] the book in Revelations the sixth
[1:18:20] chapter in the first verse when the
[1:18:21] first seal comes off the book it's a
[1:18:23] white horse rider that has a bow and no
[1:18:25] arrows in other words it's one that
[1:18:27] looks like Christ but it come to deceive
[1:18:30] many now watch what the prophet does he
[1:18:32] said now what was the second thing in
[1:18:33] Matthew 24 Jesus said and you shall hear
[1:18:36] of wars and rumors of wars and see that
[1:18:39] you be not troubled for all these things
[1:18:40] must come to pass but the end is not yet
[1:18:43] for nation shall rise against nation and
[1:18:45] Kingdom against Kingdom now how many
[1:18:47] when now now if you go back and read
[1:18:49] Revelation 6 in the fourth verse the
[1:18:51] second seal is being opened what was the
[1:18:53] second seal he said there went out
[1:18:55] another horse that was a red horse power
[1:18:57] was given upon him to take peace away
[1:19:00] from the earth well what happens when
[1:19:01] you take peace off of the earth you get
[1:19:04] war and rumors of war and Nation Rising
[1:19:06] against nation and the Bible said the
[1:19:08] peace would be taken off the Earth and
[1:19:10] they should kill one another and there
[1:19:12] was given him a great sword so the first
[1:19:14] seal was Matthew 24 the second seal was
[1:19:17] Matthew 24 what was it it was
[1:19:19] identifying the signs that the end of
[1:19:21] the world was near remember that's what
[1:19:23] they asked now what was the third thing
[1:19:25] that Jesus said Matthew 24:7 he said
[1:19:28] there shall be famines and pestilences
[1:19:30] and earthquakes in diverse places all
[1:19:32] these things are the beginning of
[1:19:33] Sorrows famines pestilences what
[1:19:36] happened in the third seal Revelation 6
[1:19:38] he said then I saw a black horse and he
[1:19:40] that set up on him had a pair of
[1:19:41] balances in his hand I heard him say in
[1:19:44] the midst of the four beasts a measure
[1:19:45] of wheat for a penny here they're
[1:19:47] begging for food a measure three
[1:19:49] measures of barley for a penny see not
[1:19:52] thou see thou hurt not the oil and the
[1:19:53] wine say see here the third seal Matthew
[1:19:56] 24 watch the fourth thing Jesus said
[1:19:59] would happen he said they'll deliver you
[1:20:01] to be afflicted and they shall kill you
[1:20:03] and you shall be hated of all Nations
[1:20:05] for my name's sake what happened in the
[1:20:07] fourth seal Revelations 6 and8 he said I
[1:20:10] looked and behold a Pale Horse and his
[1:20:12] name that set upon him was death and
[1:20:13] Hell Followed With Him and the power was
[1:20:15] given unto him over the fourth part of
[1:20:17] the earth to kill with sword and hunger
[1:20:18] and death and the Beast of the earth you
[1:20:20] said well who was it they killed you'll
[1:20:21] find that out in the fifth seal he said
[1:20:23] when the fifth seal was opened I saw
[1:20:25] under the altar The Souls of them that
[1:20:28] were slain for the word of God and the
[1:20:30] testimony for which they had does that
[1:20:33] not exactly say what Matthew 24 said he
[1:20:36] said they shall kill you and you shall
[1:20:38] be hated of all Nations for my name's
[1:20:41] sake because of the testimony they had
[1:20:43] he said they would be slain because of
[1:20:45] their testimony they would be killed my
[1:20:47] friends don't you see what's happening
[1:20:48] here that the opening of the seals was
[1:20:51] the revealing of the sign of the end of
[1:20:53] the world it was the O it was the
[1:20:55] revealing of the signs of the time
[1:20:57] that's why the Bible would say
[1:20:58] Revelations 10:7 that this Angel would
[1:21:00] come and he would declare that time
[1:21:02] would be no more you see the purpose of
[1:21:05] the Angel it was a declaration that
[1:21:06] we're living in the end time otherwise
[1:21:08] we' just go on by and say there's
[1:21:10] another thousand years that's going to
[1:21:11] come so why we got to why we even need
[1:21:13] to go to church why would you even need
[1:21:14] to tell your kids it ain't going to
[1:21:16] matter there won't be a Rapture until
[1:21:18] thousand years down the road but there
[1:21:19] has to come a time that the word would
[1:21:22] be fulfilled so here an angel of God
[1:21:24] comes and he stands one foot on the land
[1:21:26] and one foot on the sea and he makes a
[1:21:28] declaration that there shall be no time
[1:21:30] any longer this is a fulfillment of what
[1:21:32] Jesus said that that it'll be the sign
[1:21:35] of the end time he begin to remove the
[1:21:37] question from the minds of people and
[1:21:39] unfold the mystery that was upon the
[1:21:40] book and to show you who you are where
[1:21:43] you came from where you're going the age
[1:21:46] we're living in he showed you that we're
[1:21:48] living that we're in the end time oh
[1:21:50] don't you realize friends that the
[1:21:51] purpose man people get so caught up but
[1:21:53] the real just make it simple the purpose
[1:21:55] of the Angel was to show us where we're
[1:21:57] living it was to show us who we are it
[1:21:59] was to show us that that we're in the
[1:22:01] that that the age we're living in the
[1:22:03] time and and and that we ain't going to
[1:22:04] go through another hundred Generations
[1:22:06] but this is the end time it's going home
[1:22:08] time it's m it's to get the church to be
[1:22:10] Rapture Ready
[1:22:12] again when they had fallen away from God
[1:22:15] through every age the church fell away
[1:22:18] no wonder what what Satan does why does
[1:22:21] he come to destroy your confidence in
[1:22:23] God's word is't that such a wise attack
[1:22:27] he comes to destroy your confidence in
[1:22:29] the only thing that could help you so he
[1:22:31] comes I'll tell you what he don't have
[1:22:33] to come by he don't have to come by and
[1:22:35] tempt you with something he don't have
[1:22:37] to come by and get you to go off in in
[1:22:39] the sin or in the world but all he does
[1:22:40] is comes and destroys your confidence in
[1:22:42] the very thing that would take you out
[1:22:43] of this world the only way you'll ever
[1:22:46] make a Rapture this is Satan's greatest
[1:22:48] trick here this isn't something that I'm
[1:22:50] telling you today it's something that
[1:22:51] the prophet told us 50 years ago that
[1:22:53] that's Satan's greatest trick
[1:22:55] is to destroy your confidence in the
[1:22:57] word of God what's that tell me stay
[1:23:00] stay confident in God's word keep God's
[1:23:02] word at the Forefront of your of your
[1:23:04] life brother Mar don't don't don't lose
[1:23:06] faith in the word of God keep a hold of
[1:23:07] the Revelation that God has sent you m m

[1:23:12] make sure it wasn't talked into you make
[1:23:14] sure it wasn't told into you make sure
[1:23:15] nobody convinced you of it but you go
[1:23:17] somewhere get in the backs side get in a
[1:23:19] prir closet somewhere and let a
[1:23:21] revelation come by the Holy Ghost of who
[1:23:23] Jesus Christ is in this
[1:23:27] age too many people going to church they
[1:23:30] get wrapped up in too many theologies
[1:23:31] and they come really wise people and
[1:23:33] they they sit through years of dead
[1:23:34] churches trying to teach people what
[1:23:36] what things are of God they never have
[1:23:38] any Holy Ghost movement brother Mark the
[1:23:41] Revelation ain't coming from the Holy
[1:23:42] Ghost it's coming from a pastor reading
[1:23:44] it out of a book but I thank God there's
[1:23:46] still somebody that'll go to the
[1:23:47] backside of a desert and get a
[1:23:49] revelation from almighty
[1:23:51] God it can't come from a church it's got
[1:23:54] to come from God and when the devil
[1:23:57] don't want you to have it you see why he
[1:23:59] wants to keep the holy ghost out of the
[1:24:00] church he don't want you to have it he
[1:24:02] don't want you to get into that
[1:24:04] atmosphere where you don't care who you

[1:24:08] you are and you and you forget your own
[1:24:09] name he don't want you in that

[1:24:31] where a real Revelation comes said what
[1:24:33] is he trying to do destroy your
[1:24:35] confidence in the word of God because
[1:24:37] they don't want you having the
[1:24:38] Revelation but let me tell you friends

[1:24:48] has their part to play you say that
[1:24:49] means me yes you we all have a part to
[1:24:52] play according to the Bible see God part
[1:24:54] what was God's part to expose the devil
[1:24:57] what was Jesus's part he said to show it
[1:24:58] to the servants what was John's part to
[1:25:01] write it down what was the prophet's
[1:25:02] part to reveal it to you and what's your
[1:25:05] part the Bible says to hear it and to
[1:25:07] keep it see we all have a part that's
[1:25:10] what can I let me read it to you the
[1:25:12] Bible said the revelation of Jesus
[1:25:13] Christ which God gave unto him to show
[1:25:15] unto his servants the things which must
[1:25:17] shortly come to pass he sent and
[1:25:19] signified by his Angel to his servant
[1:25:22] John who bear record of the word of God
[1:25:24] and the testimony of Jesus Christ and
[1:25:26] blessed is he that reads and hears the
[1:25:28] words of this prophecy and keeps those
[1:25:30] things which are written therein for the
[1:25:32] time is at hand blessed is he that hears
[1:25:36] blessed are the readers brother Mark
[1:25:39] blessed are the hearers blessed are the
[1:25:41] keepers I say of the word of God well
[1:25:44] friends let me tell you if you've heard
[1:25:45] this message and recognize it to be true
[1:25:48] you're a truly blessed if you've heard
[1:25:50] it and you've recognized it to be the
[1:25:51] voice of God you're truly blessed or
[1:25:53] blessed by but said no man is ever the
[1:25:56] same he said you might hear in your ears
[1:25:57] a voice speaking he said but if you
[1:25:59] could ever hear it with your heart he
[1:26:00] said then you're really hearing you
[1:26:03] don't see with your eye you look with
[1:26:04] your eye but you see with your heart
[1:26:06] don't just see it don't just hear it
[1:26:08] with your ears but you you don't really
[1:26:10] just kind of want to understand it but
[1:26:11] you want to hear with your ears you want
[1:26:13] to hear with your heart he said let's
[1:26:15] hear the true voice of God and don't let
[1:26:17] it fall off of you like water off a duck
[1:26:20] B but when you really hear it you hear
[1:26:22] it with your heart and receive it in
[1:26:24] your heart and let it be received into
[1:26:26] your life and let it become who you are
[1:26:28] it's a true revelation of Jesus Christ I
[1:26:31] say every one of them oh glory to God
[1:26:33] don't you realize where we are all the
[1:26:35] rest of them has done played their part
[1:26:38] the God has done expose the devil Jesus
[1:26:40] has done showed it to the servants John
[1:26:43] has already wrote it the prophet has
[1:26:44] already revealed it now it's our time
[1:26:47] brother Mark to hear the word of God and
[1:26:49] to receive it and to say amen and to
[1:26:51] call it truth and to stand on it and
[1:26:53] catch a re revelation of who Jesus
[1:26:55] Christ is and friends let me tell you
[1:26:57] when you play your part there will be a
[1:26:59] Revival that'll come to your heart you
[1:27:01] won't be a dead church member no more
[1:27:03] you won't be looking at all these other
[1:27:04] things and other churches and all the
[1:27:06] things that they're trying to preach to
[1:27:08] put to bring a wet blanket on the people
[1:27:10] of God but something will burn in your
[1:27:11] heart that little bit of of zeal will
[1:27:13] come to your heart you'll say I believe
[1:27:16] in the revelation of Jesus Christ it's
[1:27:18] not a dead Revelation it's a holy ghost
[1:27:21] Revelation it ain't a dead Revelation
[1:27:23] it's a god-given in Revelation and it
[1:27:25] puts Revival in the heart of people
[1:27:28] Bible said he that hath an ear let him
[1:27:29] hear what the spirit says to the
[1:27:32] churches of each age brother said every
[1:27:34] age it was the same cry hear what the
[1:27:37] spirit says he said if you're a
[1:27:39] Christian you'll get back to what the
[1:27:40] spirit is teaching it's the word of God
[1:27:43] for this age if you're a real believer
[1:27:47] said every Messenger to every age will
[1:27:50] preach that word and every fresh and
[1:27:53] true Revival here it is is every fresh
[1:27:55] and true Revival will be will be because
[1:27:58] men have gotten back to the word for
[1:28:00] their age back to the word of God
[1:28:04] brother Travis back to the Holy Ghost
[1:28:06] back to praying for Revelation back to
[1:28:09] being a spiritual church you see where
[1:28:11] God's calling us you don't be no I know
[1:28:14] the the whole world can be a bunch of
[1:28:15] dead churches we're just not going to be
[1:28:16] one of them see brother M I don't like
[1:28:18] that kind of preaching with friend it's
[1:28:20] not going to change I mean I don't I
[1:28:22] hope you don't think it's going to stick
[1:28:24] around a little while and you're going
[1:28:24] to change me I caught a revelation of
[1:28:26] who Jesus Christ is I was a dead sinner
[1:28:29] that was lost in the world and he came
[1:28:30] and he changed my heart he turned my
[1:28:32] family around he turned my life around
[1:28:34] there's something in me that's burning
[1:28:36] in my heart that the devil can't put out
[1:28:38] I'm not going to be quiet about it I'm
[1:28:40] not going to stop hollering about it I
[1:28:41] ain't going to sit down on it but I'm
[1:28:43] going to stand and preach the word of
[1:28:44] God that that same gospel that changed
[1:28:46] my life could change somebody
[1:28:48] else's you want to have a dead Church go
[1:28:51] find one you ain't going to find it here
[1:28:54] he said remember we need to get back to
[1:28:56] being a spir glory to God I feel like
[1:28:58] preaching he said we need to be back to
[1:28:59] being a spiritual church remember this
[1:29:03] in the church age book remember this
[1:29:05] this ain't me this is a prophet of God
[1:29:06] speaking to you remember this Christ in
[1:29:09] the true church is a continuation of the
[1:29:11] book of Acts but the Book of Revelation
[1:29:14] shows how that the Antichrist Spirit
[1:29:16] would come into the church and defile it
[1:29:18] watch that white horse rider he looks
[1:29:20] just like him he looks just like a oh
[1:29:22] God sent man he looks just like Christ
[1:29:25] but he's a bluff he had a bow without
[1:29:26] any arrows he said he would come that
[1:29:28] Antichrist Spirit into the church and
[1:29:30] defile it what would he do brother Mark
[1:29:33] he said he would make it lukewarm make
[1:29:35] it formal and make it powerless it
[1:29:38] exposes Satan revealing his works at the
[1:29:41] attempted destruction of God's people
[1:29:43] and the discrediting of God's word right
[1:29:45] down to the time that he has cast into
[1:29:47] the Lake of Fire he'll always fight it
[1:29:50] because he can't stand it that tells me
[1:29:52] friends until the time we're taking off
[1:29:54] of this herd that old Devil's still
[1:29:55] going to be raising his ugly head and
[1:29:57] trying to take the holy ghost out of the
[1:29:59] church and trying to take the move of
[1:30:01] God out of the people of God let me tell
[1:30:03] you something about God's people he'll
[1:30:05] never get it out of them because he
[1:30:07] didn't put it in them it didn't come
[1:30:08] from a man it didn't come from a church
[1:30:10] but it came from the revelation of Jesus
[1:30:13] Christ it's a holy ghost Revelation but
[1:30:17] Mark it came from one the one and only
[1:30:19] the bright and The Morning Star he
[1:30:21] revealed it unto them it didn't come
[1:30:23] from it it came from him brother Wesley
[1:30:26] he revealed it unto them no wonder no
[1:30:29] wonder there's so many great men today
[1:30:32] that are preaching this message great
[1:30:34] men around the world I see many of them
[1:30:36] great pastors do you realize the
[1:30:38] greatest Pastors in the world they're
[1:30:40] out there preaching this message they're
[1:30:41] great men I my hat off to every one of
[1:30:44] them for doing their part for the
[1:30:45] kingdom of God they're great
[1:30:47] men sometimes you know you you hear
[1:30:50] different ones and this may not agree
[1:30:52] this just this way maybe don't agree but
[1:30:54] that's just okay because every church is
[1:30:55] Sovereign everybody don't see everything
[1:30:57] the same way everybody's Revelation
[1:30:58] ain't on the same level we we're not we
[1:31:00] we're all growing in Christ but they're
[1:31:02] great men of God and I respect them all
[1:31:05] for the office that they hold and I
[1:31:08] thank God that God has these men that
[1:31:11] will hold this message over the people
[1:31:13] to show them as a standard brother Mark
[1:31:15] of what God has called us to he says see
[1:31:18] this is what Satan don't want he knows
[1:31:21] assuredly that the original church at
[1:31:23] Pentecost listen now let this sink in he
[1:31:26] knows assuredly that that original
[1:31:28] church at Pentecost with the power of
[1:31:30] God Mark 16 and action is the true
[1:31:34] church the devil knows assuredly see the
[1:31:37] devil's sure of it most people
[1:31:39] aren't the devil's sure of it he said he
[1:31:41] knows assuredly that the True Church of
[1:31:44] God is that the original church at
[1:31:47] Pentecost with the power of God Mark 16
[1:31:49] is the true church that Jesus claims as
[1:31:51] his own everything else is false
[1:31:56] doesn't matter who it is where it is
[1:31:58] everything else is false but the true
[1:32:00] church is that original church at
[1:32:03] Pentecost with the power of God Mark 16
[1:32:06] in action that's the true church that
[1:32:08] Jesus claims as his own let me tell you
[1:32:11] something about that church it ain't a
[1:32:13] lukewarm Church it ain't a formal Church
[1:32:16] it ain't a powerless Church you know why
[1:32:19] you know some oh God some folks started
[1:32:22] out this way brother Mark but because
[1:32:23] it's it's hard to keep that standard
[1:32:25] over people it's hard to keep people
[1:32:27] that are that are being held down by
[1:32:29] leod DEA and they walk in church by the
[1:32:31] hundreds that are drugged down and
[1:32:33] chained down and bound down and it's
[1:32:35] hard for pastors to stand up and try to
[1:32:37] take those chains off of people and let
[1:32:39] the Holy Ghost move in the church and
[1:32:40] let people be free it's hard to come in
[1:32:42] week in and week out and drag people
[1:32:45] through the through the mud and and drag
[1:32:47] the chains off of them and drag the
[1:32:48] weights off their feet and help them to
[1:32:50] be able to stand up again and weak in
[1:32:52] and weak out and sometimes the ministers
[1:32:54] just get tired and they get wore down
[1:32:56] and they just give up on the fight but
[1:32:58] friends I thank God that there's a
[1:32:59] refreshing that come from the from the
[1:33:01] from the mouth of God but he said those
[1:33:04] that are thirsting from for life there's
[1:33:06] a there's a refreshing water that comes
[1:33:08] this morning there's a fresh word that
[1:33:10] said rise up and let the Holy Ghost move
[1:33:12] in the house of God rise up and get a
[1:33:15] refilling of the baptism of the Holy
[1:33:17] Ghost rise up and let a Revival strike
[1:33:19] your heart don't be lukewarm don't be
[1:33:22] formal and don't be powerless
[1:33:25] we're God's church we got a right to
[1:33:27] stand upon the word of God oh friends
[1:33:30] listen to tell you what Satan took Satan
[1:33:32] is taken a look he took a look alike
[1:33:34] church and he put a cross on the door
[1:33:36] and he conquered Millions by thinking
[1:33:38] that they're doing God of service has he
[1:33:41] not done it they've denied the power of
[1:33:43] God they denied the Holy Ghost they
[1:33:46] denied healing they denied prayer line
[1:33:48] they deny anything that has to do with
[1:33:50] the move of God they deny the revelation
[1:33:53] of Jesus Jesus Christ by doing so he has
[1:33:56] trapped many of God's children and he's
[1:33:58] keeping them from being what God called
[1:34:01] them to be friends but don't you realize
[1:34:04] that we have a call of God in this hour
[1:34:06] and I'm closing we've had a call of God
[1:34:08] in this hour and I'm going to tell you
[1:34:10] this call it was not in it was not made
[1:34:13] to be preached and left in 1950s or
[1:34:15] 1960s but this call of God is going out
[1:34:18] today me and brother Robert was visiting
[1:34:20] about it it was a call of God that came
[1:34:22] to the bride ofes Jesus Christ he said
[1:34:25] come out of her my
[1:34:27] people do you realize in the Old
[1:34:29] Testament there's a we read the story of
[1:34:31] Israel but the mark and how it types the
[1:34:33] Gentile church today so see where the
[1:34:35] where the where the church spiritual
[1:34:37] we're the church spiritual just like
[1:34:38] Israel was the church natural you know I
[1:34:41] could go through all the types of how
[1:34:43] that we're just like them that they were
[1:34:44] they were in bondage we were brought out
[1:34:46] of bondage human bondage just like
[1:34:47] Israel was brought out of Egyptian
[1:34:49] bondage I could go through all the tops
[1:34:50] that we come out of out of bondage Into
[1:34:52] the Wilderness but you know there's
[1:34:53] something that's a little different
[1:34:55] about our call and what God sent Moses
[1:34:58] to call them see our call and Israel's
[1:35:01] call was two different calls when you
[1:35:02] look when you look at what Moses's call
[1:35:04] was to the children of Israel but Mark
[1:35:06] the call wasn't to the children of
[1:35:08] Israel the call was to Pharaoh did you
[1:35:10] notice that Moses's call was let my
[1:35:13] people go I thought my isn't it
[1:35:15] something that when Moses went down this
[1:35:17] was his message let my people go it was
[1:35:19] a call to pharaoh and the reason it was
[1:35:21] a call to Pharaoh is because pharaoh had
[1:35:24] power over the people of God by prophecy
[1:35:27] by the word of God they were put under
[1:35:28] the power of pharaoh they were put under
[1:35:30] the uh they were put under bondage of
[1:35:32] pharaoh by the word of God he said
[1:35:33] they'll be in bondage under them for 400
[1:35:35] years and because the word of God had
[1:35:37] put them under bondage of pharaoh then
[1:35:39] it had to take God to come by and he had
[1:35:42] to declare unto pharaoh to let him go
[1:35:44] but watch when our call came in this
[1:35:45] hour our call was come out of her my
[1:35:48] people the call wasn't to the devil the
[1:35:51] call to us was to the Bride of Jesus
[1:35:53] Christ cist you know what that tells me
[1:35:55] is that when God sent Moses to Israel he
[1:35:58] had to call Pharaoh cuz Pharaoh had
[1:36:00] power over him but when God sent a
[1:36:01] message to us he didn't he don't have to
[1:36:04] tell the devil anything he told you come
[1:36:07] out of it because the devil has already
[1:36:09] been defeated the enemy that has you
[1:36:11] bound has no power over you the
[1:36:13] Taskmaster that has you bound he has no
[1:36:15] authority over you he was defeated at
[1:36:17] Calvary so he gave you a different call
[1:36:19] he said come out of her my people he
[1:36:22] don't have to talk the devil out of it
[1:36:23] he don't have to show him any signs he
[1:36:25] don't have to do any wonders in his
[1:36:27] presence it's a call to every individual
[1:36:29] come out of her my people and when you
[1:36:31] get tired of living in it you may tell
[1:36:33] you what you'll do but Mark you'll throw
[1:36:34] your bag over your shoulder and you'll
[1:36:36] put your feet or in your shoes and
[1:36:38] you'll go down the road and say devil I
[1:36:39] ain't going to be a part of it no more I
[1:36:41] want to be a part of the move of
[1:36:43] almighty God I want the power of the
[1:36:45] Holy Ghost to be preached to my family I
[1:36:47] want to see the power of this message
[1:36:49] demonstrated in the preaching of the
[1:36:51] word of God it's a call to the people of
[1:36:55] God come out of her my people if you
[1:36:56] want to stand to your feet God don't
[1:36:58] have to talk the devil out you know why
[1:37:00] brother brother David Paul because we're
[1:37:02] already fighting a defeated enemy he
[1:37:05] beat our Taskmaster before we was ever
[1:37:08] born my isn't that good see their
[1:37:10] Taskmaster they he was he he he still
[1:37:13] had them defeated he was still alive but
[1:37:15] ours has already been defeated come out
[1:37:18] of her my people I don't have to go do
[1:37:20] 10 things and put some plagues and
[1:37:24] to get the devil to leave you alone I
[1:37:26] don't have to take the the staff and lay
[1:37:28] it on the ground and turn it into a
[1:37:30] snake again so the devil will leave you
[1:37:31] alone I don't have to displace some
[1:37:33] great Supernatural sign so the devil
[1:37:35] will leave you alone it was a call of
[1:37:37] God to every individual you come out of
