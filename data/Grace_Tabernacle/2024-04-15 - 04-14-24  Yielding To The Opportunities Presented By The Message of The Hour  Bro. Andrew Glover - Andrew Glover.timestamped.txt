[39:20] in the name of the Lord and we counted
[39:22] an honor and privilege to be here once
[39:23] again with you all and and appreciate
[39:25] brother Matt for the invitation the
[39:27] opport opportunity the confidence to
[39:28] stand here while he's away and minister
[39:30] to you we just pray the Lord would bless
[39:32] them and amen how many has come to have
[39:34] church today amen amen here in the book
[39:37] of St John the 18th
[39:39] chapter and in the 37th verse we read
[39:43] this last time we spoke to but I want to
[39:45] pick up a few things again here out of
[39:47] St John 18 and verse 37 the Bible says
[39:52] pilate therefore said unto him art thou
[39:55] a king then Jesus answered and thou and
[39:59] thou sayest that I am a king and to this
[40:03] end was I born and for this cause came I
[40:06] into the world now that I should bear
[40:09] witness unto the truth for everyone that
[40:12] is of the truth heareth my voice how
[40:14] many here this morning can say you're of
[40:17] the truth amen and pilate saith unto him
[40:20] what is truth think of that he's looking
[40:22] at truth and asking what is truth and
[40:25] when he had said this he went out again
[40:27] into to the Jews and sath unto them I
[40:29] find in him no fault at all but ye have
[40:32] a custom that I should release unto you
[40:35] one at the Passover now will you
[40:38] therefore that I release unto you the
[40:40] king of the Jews then cried they all
[40:43] again saying not this man but barabus
[40:48] now barabus was a robber now I find it
[40:51] very interesting that they turned down
[40:53] the anointed word and accepted a robber
[40:56] in the place
[40:58] of the anointed word now there they were
[41:00] in the presence of the anointed word if
[41:02] we can look in Psalms chapter
[41:04] 16 Psalms chapter 16 with that in mind
[41:09] standing in the presence of the anointed
[41:11] word in Psalms chapter 16 and verse 11 I
[41:14] know this is a very very familiar
[41:16] reading uh to you this morning we could
[41:19] probably quote it by heart in psalm
[41:22] 16 and verse 11 David says this he says
[41:27] Thou will show me the path of life for
[41:30] in thy presence is the fullness of joy
[41:34] in thy presence is the fullness of joy
[41:37] and at thy right hand there are
[41:40] Pleasures forever more amen let's just
[41:43] bow our hearts together today Heavenly
[41:44] Father Lord what an honor it is to be
[41:47] your children here today Father to be
[41:49] gathered together Lord not just in a
[41:51] church service Lord fulfilling religious
[41:54] duty but Lord we're here because there
[41:57] is is a deep calling to the deep and
[41:58] Lord there's a group of people standing
[42:01] before me today Lord that are Desiring
[42:03] to serve you to follow you and Lord as
[42:06] we come here this morning we come for
[42:08] one motive and one objective and that is
[42:10] to lift up the name that is above every
[42:12] name Lord that at the name of Jesus
[42:14] every knee would bow every tongue would
[42:16] confess Lord at your name situations can
[42:19] change at Your Name Lord Believers can
[42:22] take another step in your grace and I'm
[42:24] praying this morning that you would send
[42:26] the spirit wisdom and Revelation into
[42:28] this meeting oh God may you drive out
[42:30] every Spirit that's unlike the Holy
[42:32] Spirit oh God lord I pray for those that
[42:35] may be sick in their body today I'm
[42:37] asking Lord that you would send
[42:38] Deliverance in that body for those that
[42:40] may be Lord at home unable to be here
[42:42] will listen Lord to the internet or or
[42:45] by the way of the archive I pray Lord
[42:47] that this word would strengthen their
[42:49] lives and Lord I pray you forgive us of
[42:51] our failures you forgive us of our
[42:53] shortcomings or we don't want to leave
[42:55] here like we came so father we're asking
[42:57] you you're yielding to your word changes
[43:00] this morning and we'll be sure to give
[43:02] thee all the praise all the honor and
[43:04] all the glory in the wonderful name of
[43:06] our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ we pray
[43:09] and all the Believers says amen and amen
[43:12] God bless you this morning as you can
[43:14] have your seats I want to this morning
[43:16] by the help of the Lord amen maybe just
[43:19] to speak to you here today if I title
[43:21] this today I want to speak to you on
[43:23] yielded
[43:37] To Us by the message of the hour and we
[43:40] established I believe a Vindicated
[43:42] answer uh to the question of what is
[43:44] truth you know we look and we found that
[43:47] the message of the hour brother BR says
[43:49] it is Christ it's not a religion it's
[43:51] not a tradition it's Christ so then we
[43:53] find amen that the message of the hour
[43:56] is simply a amen God's promise for the
[43:58] present hour amen according to the
[44:01] scripture so we're not here this morning
[44:03] doing things apart from scripture we are
[44:05] doing things according to scripture now
[44:08] in Revelation 10 we looked there last
[44:10] time and we found that there was a cloud
[44:12] that appeared out there in Sunset
[44:13] mountain and we identified amen that
[44:16] that was Christ and out of that cloud he
[44:18] descended with an open book right amen
[44:20] and that was where our rapturing faith
[44:22] has come from and maybe this morning
[44:24] just to lay a foundation refresh your
[44:26] men uh your me
[44:27] by reading this quote power of
[44:28] transformation 65 he says we are now
[44:31] ready for a battle how many's ready for
[44:33] a battle amen the trumpet is to sound
[44:35] the hymns have been sang he said and now
[44:38] comes the word but to hear these
[44:39] comments of these young soldiers here
[44:41] myself getting old and listen around but
[44:43] your faith and confidence and what you
[44:46] have placed in to believe the message
[44:48] that I have been given of God he said
[44:50] now if it wasn't for you all the message
[44:52] would do no good amen I don't know maybe
[44:55] how you're feeling this morning but if
[44:57] if you're feeling a little bit low that
[44:58] ought to put you on the highs of highs
[45:00] amen that if it wasn't for you all the
[45:02] message would do no good see it's got to
[45:04] be somebody to believe it and as long as
[45:07] it's coming from God then there's going
[45:09] to be somebody believe it you see
[45:11] because God has made a way amen I
[45:13] believe we can all testify this morning
[45:16] that God has made a way where there was
[45:19] no way amen he was the way see God has
[45:22] made a way he said he has affixed his
[45:24] great economy amen like that that when
[45:27] he sends for something amen there is
[45:29] something there to meet that something
[45:31] the Deep responds to the call of the
[45:34] deep amen see it's got to be that way
[45:36] now amen we're speaking this morning on
[45:38] yielding to Opportunities now the
[45:41] definition there of opportunity it is a
[45:43] set of circumstances amen that makes it
[45:46] possible to do something it is a chance
[45:49] for success or advancement occurs so
[45:52] amen amen an opportunity amen is when
[45:55] something is set up or something is
[45:57] fixed or something is arranged Amen in a
[46:00] way that you actually accept that and
[46:03] when you accept that you advance by what
[46:05] you are accepting I want to say this
[46:07] morning I do not believe that we are
[46:09] going backwards I do not believe that we
[46:11] are retreating I do not believe we're
[46:13] turning to the left or turning to the
[46:15] right amen but I believe as the Church
[46:17] of the Living God Amen we are advancing
[46:20] in the promises we are advancing in The
[46:22] Inheritance we are advancing amen
[46:25] everything that God said we could move
[46:26] move into amen I believe this is the
[46:29] generation that we're moving into it I
[46:31] love how the prophet of God says this in
[46:33] spite of dungeons or swords or storms
[46:36] amen God's Church marches onward amen I
[46:39] think that's a preaching point in spite
[46:41] of storms in spite of dungeons in spite
[46:44] of trials in spite of anything amen
[46:47] God's church is moving onward amen we're
[46:49] so happy to be a part amen of that
[46:51] blessed body looking shortly for the
[46:53] coming of our blessed Lord amen who will
[46:56] receive us up into his kingdom amen into
[46:58] his presence there will be with him
[47:00] forever oh the Glorious thoughts amen
[47:04] and the joy that sweeps through our
[47:06] souls amen when we look upon these
[47:08] promises amen think about that there is
[47:11] a joy amen that sweeps through our souls
[47:14] amen when we're looking upon these
[47:16] promises and the holy spirit amen is
[47:19] bearing record unto us that they are the
[47:21] truth amen you all know that when you
[47:23] start sweeping something the reason you
[47:26] sweep it amen is you're getting rid of
[47:28] something amen so something else can
[47:30] move there when you sweep something
[47:32] whatever is laying there does not belong
[47:34] there amen so by sweeping you are
[47:36] removing it and I want to say this
[47:38] morning if depression is laying in your
[47:40] heart amen it does not belong there amen
[47:43] amen if negativity or sickness is laying
[47:45] in your heart it does not belong there
[47:48] amen but God who is rich in Mercy amen
[47:51] has sent a message that is a message of
[47:53] Promise amen and as those promises begin
[47:56] to sweep through the soul of a Believer
[47:58] amen the promises will sweep out
[48:00] sickness amen the promises will sweep
[48:03] out discouragement I say oh God this
[48:05] morning amen release the joy of your
[48:08] presence in the heart of every believer
[48:10] and let it sweep out depression let it
[48:12] sweep out condemnation let it sweep out
[48:15] negativity and let the joy of the Lord
[48:18] amen become the strength of the church I
[48:20] do not believe we're going backwards I
[48:22] do not believe we're retreating amen I
[48:25] believe we're moving onward and upward
[48:27] Amen Brother Don we got one goal and
[48:29] that's rapture we got one place to be
[48:31] and that's the future home amen and no
[48:33] matter what the devil froze at us we
[48:35] have been anointed by the message of the
[48:37] hour Amen to overcome every devil to
[48:40] overcome every situation we are living
[48:43] in the hour of the advancement of the
[48:44] Gospel of Jesus Christ amen can you say
[48:47] with me we're not going backwards we're
[48:50] going
[48:51] forward I don't feel like it we're going
[48:54] forward I don't know how we're going to
[48:56] make it we're going forward I don't know
[48:58] what tomorrow holds we're going forward
[49:01] well I'm sick in my body we're going
[49:03] forward well I failed God yesterday
[49:05] we're going forward church we have not
[49:07] been anointed to come this far and lay
[49:09] down and quit there is an anointing Upon
[49:12] Our Lives Amen to tear down every devil
[49:15] destroy every Spirit walk on every Power
[49:18] come on church I think it's time Amen to
[49:20] rise up and let the joy of the Holy
[49:23] Ghost sweep in the church again until we
[49:25] can catch a vision of the future future
[49:27] amen by the message of the hour but said
[49:29] the thing today is amen the church grain
[49:32] don't want to mature it wants to stay
[49:34] like it was back in Moody's time or s or
[49:37] fine or noox or Calvin he said they were
[49:39] all right amen they were the light of
[49:42] their hour now when you mention names
[49:43] like Moody sanki finny Knox Calvin what
[49:46] we're referring to is reformers amen who
[49:49] were operating in the age of reformation
[49:52] but what they were bringing was not
[49:53] enough to bring a people unto perfection
[49:56] so in order to bring the church to
[49:58] Perfection amen God had to fulfill his
[50:01] word amen by sending us a prophet he
[50:04] said see this is another hour this is
[50:06] another day amen this is the advancement
[50:09] of the Gospel it's coming to its
[50:12] maturity amen I want to prophesy Over
[50:14] You by the word this morning amen you're
[50:16] not going to remain an infancy amen
[50:19] according to a prophet amen you're
[50:21] moving into maturity amen I don't care
[50:23] how long you've been in church I don't
[50:25] care the past I don't care the
[50:27] background amen I have heard a
[50:29] Vindicated prophet and he has said you
[50:31] are coming to maturity and there ain't
[50:34] enough Devils to stop it we're in the
[50:36] fat days to defeat it amen what God has
[50:39] purposed in his heart will be manifested
[50:41] in his church and the devil won't stop
[50:44] it and bad days won't stop it because we
[50:46] have been given an anointing by the word
[50:49] of God in the age we're living in it's
[50:52] coming to its maturity amen I want to
[50:54] tell that devil amen he might have run
[50:56] us around in our infancy amen but we're
[50:58] coming to maturity are you hearing me
[51:01] amen do you know what's changing the
[51:03] type of services you're having amen it's
[51:05] not because of who's preaching it's not
[51:07] because of who's coming or who's going
[51:09] it's because you and your Christian walk
[51:11] are moving into a place of maturity
[51:14] where the devil don't know what to do
[51:16] with you come on church amen y'all
[51:18] remember what it was like in your
[51:20] infancy amen if something was a little
[51:22] wrong before church amen you come in and
[51:24] you couldn't get past it and you
[51:25] couldn't raise feel like preaching and
[51:27] you couldn't shout and you couldn't
[51:29] enjoy the anointing amen but now you
[51:31] moved from infancy into maturity and
[51:34] when something bad happens before church
[51:36] or somebody says something to you
[51:38] negative amen that don't kill your
[51:40] service amen you are a mature Christan
[51:43] and you have a revelation in your soul
[51:45] and everything is going to be okay I
[51:47] don't care who said what I don't care
[51:49] who looked at me wrong I have received a
[51:52] vision Amen in the presence of God yes
[51:55] sir L we're coming to maturity it's
[51:59] coming see we can't live in what Luther
[52:01] said or what Wesley said or some of the
[52:03] rest of them we're living in the light
[52:06] amen that's predicted for this day we
[52:09] are living in the light amen that is
[52:11] predicted for this day we're in the
[52:13] seventh Church age he said not the third
[52:16] or the fourth Church age amen the grain
[52:19] should be able to receive it amen you
[52:21] are that grain seed bride then you
[52:24] should be able to receive amen the word
[52:27] that is coming in the hour you're living
[52:29] in he said if it doesn't receive it amen
[52:32] then it falls off and it means nothing
[52:34] to it he said but the grain is matured
[52:37] with the light amen the grain is matured
[52:41] with the light amen if it goes ahead
[52:44] with the light so the only way the grain
[52:46] matures amen is if it advances with the
[52:49] light amen as the light advances you
[52:52] know what John said he said in 1 John
[52:55] 1:7 amen if we walk in the light amen I
[52:59] love that if we walk in the light amen
[53:01] as he is in the light then we have
[53:03] Fellowship one with another amen and the
[53:06] blood of Jesus Christ his son amen
[53:09] cleanseth us from all sin 1 John 1:7
[53:12] amen if we walk in the light amen as he
[53:15] is in the light then we have Fellowship
[53:17] one with another amen I love the
[53:19] definition of this word walk it means to
[53:21] make one's way it means to progress in
[53:24] other words if you're walking amen
[53:26] you're not staying where you were and
[53:28] you're not going back to where you come
[53:30] from amen but you're walking and you are
[53:33] progressing Amen to walk in the light it
[53:36] means to make due use of opportunities
[53:39] amen oh that makes me want to shout
[53:42] hallelujah amen the word walk means in
[53:44] the Greek it means to make use of due
[53:47] opportunities in Romans 13:11 Paul said
[53:50] knowing the time that now is High Time
[53:53] Amen to wake out of sleep amen for now
[53:56] is our Salvation nearer amen than when
[53:59] we believed the night is far spent amen
[54:02] the day is at hand so let us therefore
[54:05] cast off the works of darkness and let
[54:07] us put on Amen the armor of light amen
[54:11] if you're going to walk in the light
[54:13] you're going to have to have the armor
[54:14] of the light amen that's the only thing
[54:16] that will defeat the darkness come on
[54:18] church amen you can't wear Luther's
[54:20] message and defeat the darkness of Leota
[54:23] you can't wear a reformer message and
[54:26] defeat the darkness of ecclesiastical
[54:28] Devils but there is a light that has
[54:30] been provided by the message of the hour
[54:33] and if you can cast off the works of
[54:34] darkness and put on the armor of light
[54:37] you can walk as a son of light you can
[54:39] sing well I might as well just preacher
[54:42] for a second amen we are not in darkness
[54:44] we are not hopeless helplessly confused
[54:47] aimlessly wandering through Darkness but
[54:49] we have received a message and it's a
[54:51] message of light and we are the Grain
[54:54] and we're walking with the light and as
[54:56] we're walking with the lot amen our
[54:58] worship is maturing Our Praise Is
[55:00] maturing our character is matur yes sir
[55:05] come on we might as well preach a amen a
[55:07] 5-year-old acts like a 5-year-old
[55:09] because they're 5 years old a
[55:11] 10-year-old acts like a 10 year old
[55:13] because they're 10 years old amen a 50y
[55:15] old shouldn't be acting like a 5-year
[55:17] old and a oh come on are you hearing me
[55:19] there's got to come a time amen that you
[55:22] move to maturity amen and the only way
[55:25] you can mature as the light matures and
[55:28] you walk with that light Paul says in
[55:30] Ephesians 5:116 he says Redeeming the
[55:33] time because the days are evil now I
[55:37] want to break this down Redeeming the
[55:38] time that actually means to buy up every
[55:42] and each
[55:43] opportunity it means to buy up every and
[55:47] each opportunity look at this word time
[55:49] it is the Supreme moment can you can can
[55:53] you take that in your heart it is the
[55:55] Supreme moment it is the golden
[55:58] opportunity Paul is saying amen buy up
[56:02] amen every and each opportunity amen use
[56:05] every Supreme moment use every golden
[56:08] opportunity in other words Paul is
[56:10] saying amen redeem our golden
[56:12] opportunity in the presence of God
[56:15] himself now I love what the prophet of
[56:17] God said he said don't never fail your
[56:19] opportunity see Satan is always trying
[56:23] Amen to cause us to miss our spiritual
[56:25] opportunity ities by using natural
[56:28] things remember said oh we have to
[56:29] polish the car we can't go to church on
[56:32] Sunday no I know Jesus comes to the
[56:34] church but my I ain't got time to go
[56:36] over there if I fail to get my oil
[56:38] change today it may burn my bearings out
[56:40] tomorrow he said burn them out that's
[56:43] right he said burn them out he said I'd
[56:46] rather my Barons be burned out amen than
[56:48] my soul to torment in Hell through all
[56:51] eternity don't you miss your opportunity
[56:54] it's presented to every man and woman in
[56:57] this world daily like that amen but they
[56:59] fail to get to see their opportunity can
[57:02] I say this to you your opportunity in
[57:05] his presence is not a possibility amen
[57:08] it is a appointment amen it is an
[57:11] assurity listen you're not coming in his
[57:14] presence amen hoping you will find Joy
[57:17] hoping you will find Deliverance hoping
[57:19] you will find Victory amen all those
[57:21] things are in his presence and the light
[57:24] is the presence of God if we can step
[57:26] out of confusion if we can step out of
[57:29] the darkness and we can step over into
[57:31] the light of his presence then every
[57:33] desire of the heart will be made
[57:35] manifest I love the problem of God's
[57:37] words he said every sinner that's in
[57:39] here he said perhaps there would be one
[57:41] you've been saved amen since Jesus died
[57:45] well that's a long time ago brother
[57:47] Travis but a prophet said amen you were
[57:49] saved when Jesus died but you don't
[57:52] never die here he said but don't you
[57:54] never die here where you're opportunity
[57:56] was placed before you so your
[57:58] opportunity to accept oh God what Jesus
[58:02] done at Calvary was not on the literal
[58:04] day that he hung on Mount Calvary but in
[58:07] his mind amen he had a time where you
[58:10] would come into the presence of the
[58:11] finished work of what he did at Calvary
[58:14] and that would be your opportunity to
[58:16] accept what he did 2,000 years ago in
[58:19] other words brother Wes say Amen 2,000
[58:21] years ago you were saved but the night
[58:23] you got saved was not the night you
[58:26] really got saved it was the night you
[58:28] accepted what he' done for you 2,000

[58:44] the Deliverance so the only thing you're
[58:47] doing today amen is accepting what he

[1:01:51] there is an atonement between you and
[1:01:53] judgment and if you can accept it right
[1:01:55] now oh God Amen then you're already

[1:03:48] here now is the day of salvation I love
[1:03:51] what the prophet of God said this is our
[1:03:53] visitation let's remember Christ he's
[1:03:56] the same yesterday today and forever
[1:03:58] Hebrews 13:8 don't wait till some region

[1:04:03] where you cannot go in the presence of
[1:04:05] God see right now you have the
[1:04:07] opportunity to go in the presence of God
[1:04:11] the blood is making it available for you
[1:04:14] to go into his presence and your time is
[1:04:17] up on Earth in the nightmare of horror
[1:04:19] you'll remember you had your opportunity
[1:04:21] and turned it away let the young people
[1:04:23] take notice to this he said let all all
[1:04:25] take notice to it amen see in our
[1:04:28] scripture this morning the scene of our
[1:04:29] scripture we are reading about Jesus
[1:04:32] Christ amen who was fing a hang on that
[1:04:34] cross but he's in Pilot's Hall brother
[1:04:37] said see we stand now watch brother bam
[1:04:39] I love how he preaches things because he
[1:04:41] brings it from then to now and he says
[1:04:44] we're standing in a similar situation
[1:04:46] this morning the world over a trial see
[1:04:49] all denominations has turned down the
[1:04:51] word I know this sounds very harsh and I
[1:04:54] want the ministers who is listening here
[1:04:56] present those on tape also to try to
[1:04:59] understand this now that I try to make
[1:05:01] it plain but I'm holding my point or
[1:05:03] making my point here and saying that we
[1:05:06] are standing today in another Pilot's
[1:05:09] judgment hall now think about that a
[1:05:12] prophet of God said we're standing today
[1:05:15] in another Pilot's judgment Hall you say
[1:05:18] well if I had just stood there I would
[1:05:19] have spoke out for Jesus Christ well
[1:05:22] what are you doing about it now
[1:05:25] amen come on hindsight 2020 right you
[1:05:28] can sit here this morning and say if I
[1:05:30] would have been back there if I would
[1:05:32] have stood back there I would have done
[1:05:34] this and I would now don't get mad at me
[1:05:37] amen but some of you are saying that and
[1:05:38] you can't even say Amen
[1:05:41] here come on some of you saying oh if
[1:05:44] I'd have been back there brother Joe I
[1:05:46] would have stood for him amen but you're
[1:05:47] here now and can't stand for him you see
[1:05:49] what I'm saying amen it's the devil
[1:05:51] trying to rob you amen of using your
[1:05:54] opportunity in his presence Amen to
[1:05:56] advance from the condition you're in
[1:05:58] into the condition God desires to see
[1:06:01] you in according to his word I want to
[1:06:03] tell that devil Satan you ain't got
[1:06:06] enough you ain't got enough to stop us
[1:06:09] you ain't got enough to hold us amen
[1:06:11] there is a seed on the inside of our
[1:06:13] soul and the seed on side of our soul
[1:06:16] amen is stronger than the pressure
[1:06:18] against our flesh listen we're not here
[1:06:21] making a decision God made the decision
[1:06:23] for us we're just yielding to what he
[1:06:26] done for us that day at Calvary well
[1:06:28] what are you doing about it now he said
[1:06:30] that's the thing no matter how much the
[1:06:32] church had turned him down I would have
[1:06:34] stood by his side you've got the
[1:06:36] opportunity uhhuh see they turned him
[1:06:38] down can I say this pilot amen had his
[1:06:42] opportunity in the presence of the
[1:06:47] atonement now can I show you something
[1:06:50] brother said pilot his only opportunity
[1:06:52] he ever had and he asked him he said now
[1:06:55] let me see something done see let me see
[1:06:57] some sign said what pilot should have
[1:06:59] done was he should have
[1:07:01] repented listen Church he's in the
[1:07:04] presence of the forgiver he's in the
[1:07:07] presence of the atonement he's in the
[1:07:09] presence brother brother Tom of the one
[1:07:12] who can change his future listen Pilot's
[1:07:14] in a position right now but he's got an
[1:07:17] opportunity in the presence of Jesus
[1:07:19] Christ amen to advance amen from where
[1:07:22] he is into being a forgiven man are you
[1:07:25] he hear me the opportunity was presented
[1:07:28] and he said oh do me some Trick R said
[1:07:30] he had an opportunity but when he had
[1:07:32] his opportunity to accepted wanted some
[1:07:34] kind of a clown or some kind of a trick
[1:07:37] or some kind of a magic rabbit to bring
[1:07:38] out of a hat you know or something he
[1:07:40] said oh I would see you do some trick
[1:07:42] you know or something like that he said
[1:07:44] pilot was a nut he had a chance to
[1:07:47] receive it but he didn't come on church
[1:07:50] he had a chance to receive it amen but
[1:07:53] he didn't so you know what he did he
[1:07:55] stayed in the same condition and he died
[1:07:58] an insane man with the blood of Jesus
[1:08:00] Christ on his hands come on church and
[1:08:03] the prophet of God said his blood will
[1:08:05] either be on your hands or sister Judy
[1:08:07] it'll be in our hearts and I want to say
[1:08:10] this morning I may be in another pilot
[1:08:12] Hall but the blood of my Lord is not on
[1:08:15] my hands it's going to move into my
[1:08:17] heart and by that blood I'm going to
[1:08:19] advance to Victory and by that blood I'm
[1:08:22] going to advance to the Future Hope and
[1:08:24] by that blood I'm going to take a
[1:08:26] Rapture and by that blood my family is
[1:08:28] going to be saved and by that blood my
[1:08:31] body's going to be healed and by that
[1:08:33] blood my future is going to be
[1:08:37] clear you're in the presence of the
[1:08:40] atonement and there's a bleeding bloody
[1:08:43] word now you said brother why are you so
[1:08:46] heavy on a prophet because the Prophet
[1:08:49] come into pilot Hall and saved us from
[1:08:51] Pilot
[1:08:53] Hall he said denomination is turn turn
[1:08:55] this word down listen they've taken one
[1:08:58] book and made a thousand translations of
[1:09:00] it come on now we've even moved from the
[1:09:03] King James to the Queen
[1:09:06] James maybe you didn't know that it's
[1:09:08] Sodom and Gomorrah again we don't have a
[1:09:11] King James they got a transgender Bible
[1:09:14] I might as well preach I'm here do you
[1:09:16] see what theyve done they've turned down
[1:09:19] the word now you you'd be crazy to say
[1:09:22] that denominations is better today than
[1:09:24] they were 50 years ago
[1:09:26] when they turned down this word brother
[1:09:28] they did not Advance they regressed they
[1:09:31] went
[1:09:32] backwards come on now because you cannot
[1:09:35] stand in the presence of an atonement
[1:09:38] and your attitude remain as it's just
[1:09:40] another message or another church
[1:09:42] service and leave a better person come
[1:09:45] on I might as well bring it on down to
[1:09:46] you amen can I get it through your head
[1:09:48] Grace Tabernacle these are not just
[1:09:51] Services these are not just Wednesday
[1:09:53] nights and Sunday mornings and if
[1:09:55] meetings here and again listen these are
[1:09:58] [Applause]
[1:09:59] opportunities come on somebody asked me
[1:10:01] one time ler why do you go to a pull pit
[1:10:03] on Wednesday night and preach your heart
[1:10:05] out like it's a convention I said
[1:10:07] because to me it is a convention I don't
[1:10:09] care if there's five or 500 or three
[1:10:13] it's an opportunity to stand in the
[1:10:16] middle of pilot Hall in a world of
[1:10:18] determination to destroy this word and
[1:10:21] throw a Lifeline out to somebody and say
[1:10:23] there's a God and he's a a mighty God
[1:10:26] he's a miracle working God he's a way
[1:10:28] making God he's a saving God come on
[1:10:31] Grace Tabernacle I pray to God we never
[1:10:34] get to the place where we just let the
[1:10:36] services become just common and we see
[1:10:38] who sing well I might as well preach I
[1:10:41] miss close to it amen you know what you
[1:10:44] can I preach Mark amen I say God forbid
[1:10:46] we ever get in the condition we sit
[1:10:48] around and compare preachers and compare
[1:10:51] singers well they sung better and that's
[1:10:53] funny and make a joke out of everything
[1:10:55] in the house of God I say God forbid the
[1:10:58] day that the house of God ever becomes a
[1:11:01] House of Comedy it's a house of
[1:11:03] correction it's a house of change it's a
[1:11:05] House of Authority it's a place where
[1:11:07] God can come on the scene and rescue our
[1:11:10] babies and save homes and save lives
[1:11:13] from the destruction of the
[1:11:16] [Music]
[1:11:17] enemy it's
[1:11:19] opportunities it's
[1:11:21] opportunities come on Church Isaiah 28
[1:11:24] said all the tables are full of vomit
[1:11:26] right go read your Bible all the tables
[1:11:28] are full of vomit remember said those
[1:11:30] tables are denominations he said they're
[1:11:32] everyone full of vomit he said there's
[1:11:34] Baptist vomit that don't get mad at me
[1:11:37] there's Pentecostal vomit come on Church
[1:11:40] you know what vomit comes from it comes
[1:11:42] from something that made you
[1:11:45] sick come on and what they laid on the
[1:11:47] altar literally made God sick to his
[1:11:50] stomach and he said it's
[1:11:53] vomit come on you you want me prove it
[1:11:56] to you amen amen just put your name on
[1:11:57] the card
[1:11:59] and you're saved could you imagine
[1:12:02] sister Chloe being the Lord Jesus that
[1:12:04] hung on Calvary shed his blood went
[1:12:07] through all that and then stand and see
[1:12:09] somebody say now if you want to be saved
[1:12:11] here's all you got to do just put your
[1:12:13] name on a card and shake a preacher's
[1:12:15] hand come on Sir y'all know what I'm
[1:12:17] talking about they been work hard on
[1:12:19] something and then watch something
[1:12:20] happen to it and what do you say that
[1:12:22] makes me about Plum sick you know why
[1:12:25] because you put your all into it and
[1:12:27] somewhere somebody amen determined what
[1:12:29] you done wasn't enough so they got to
[1:12:31] add to it or take away from it and I
[1:12:33] want to say this as plain as I know how
[1:12:36] denominations has added to this word and
[1:12:38] they've taken away from this word until
[1:12:40] it's another book on another shelf but I
[1:12:43] say thank God in the last days he would
[1:12:45] send a prophet into this generation who
[1:12:48] would stand on the platform and say all
[1:12:50] the tables are full of vomit but there's
[1:12:52] an elaser call there's a Malachi for
[1:12:55] call there's a return to the word call
[1:12:58] coming in the church to lead us back to
[1:13:00] the paths of Holiness yes sir somebody
[1:13:04] Shout with me God sent a
[1:13:06] prophet somebody shouted with me God
[1:13:09] sent a prophet thank God for the
[1:13:11] reformers but thank God David Paul he
[1:13:13] sent a prophet thank God for the sankes
[1:13:16] and the finnies and the knocks and the
[1:13:18] Calvin but thank God for
[1:13:21] [Applause]
[1:13:22] Elijah who can say now you're dying
[1:13:24] where you're at
[1:13:25] that you got to move with light now you
[1:13:29] know this in Amos 3:7 the Bible says
[1:13:31] surely the Lord God will do
[1:13:34] nothing but he revealeth his Secrets
[1:13:37] unto his servants the prophets in
[1:13:40] Malachi 4:5 behold I will send you
[1:13:43] Elijah the prophet can I just stop and
[1:13:45] say something to you A lot of people
[1:13:47] only see brother random and Malachi
[1:13:49] four all they see is Elijah the prophet
[1:13:53] but can I say there's actually three
[1:13:56] people in Malachi 4:5 behold I which is
[1:14:01] God the Lord Jesus Christ the Father of
[1:14:03] Lights behold I will send
[1:14:07] you come on now put your name there
[1:14:10] behold I will send Andrew Glover behold
[1:14:14] I will send Don Reynolds behold I will
[1:14:17] send Morgan moris Elijah let's put a
[1:14:19] name there William Mary and brandham the
[1:14:22] Prophet come on it ain't all about a man
[1:14:25] it ain't all about a prophet it's about
[1:14:27] the work of restoration being done in
[1:14:30] the church to return the heart of the
[1:14:33] children amen back to the faith of God
[1:14:36] to believe that what he done he still
[1:14:38] does come on Ecclesiastes tree amen he
[1:14:41] is the god that never changes he is the
[1:14:43] Ever Changing amen rather unchanging God
[1:14:46] and he's the same yesterday today and
[1:14:49] forever said it'll take a prophet to get
[1:14:52] the Revelation because God has no other
[1:14:55] other way of bringing out his scriptural
[1:14:57] Revelations except by a prophet God has
[1:15:01] no other way of declaring to you that
[1:15:04] this is your opportunity except by
[1:15:09] prophit watch what he says amen now
[1:15:11] watch amen and he says the word always
[1:15:14] comes by a prophet and always will this
[1:15:17] is the law of God is evident even by
[1:15:19] casual search of
[1:15:22] scripture so you don't have to have a
[1:15:24] degree to believe it but we ought to all
[1:15:27] shout
[1:15:28] hallelujah you ain't got to be born in
[1:15:30] the right family to believe that God
[1:15:32] still uses
[1:15:33] Prophet you ain't got to come out of Bob
[1:15:35] Jones University or graduate from
[1:15:38] Harvard to believe that God still uses
[1:15:40] prophets but God by a casual search of
[1:15:43] his scripture can see that he does he
[1:15:46] said what is it it's the unchanging God
[1:15:48] with unchanging ways invariably sent his
[1:15:51] prophet in every age where the people
[1:15:54] had stray
[1:15:55] amen from divine order so what is this
[1:15:58] message it is the restoring of divine
[1:16:00] order all the tables are full of vomit
[1:16:04] because somewhere they got out of order
[1:16:07] oh come on church and how can we get
[1:16:09] back in order unless God send somebody
[1:16:11] that knows the order sir y'all remember
[1:16:14] the prodag god that they're out there
[1:16:16] working on the car remember that he said

[1:16:59] didn't talk like him but he had the
[1:17:01] answer to make the car run and I love
[1:17:03] how the prophet of God said it brother
[1:17:05] Wesley he said that mechanic looked back

[1:17:21] opportunity oh god with the one who with

[1:17:28] who made the car was now standing in his
[1:17:31] presence with the answer on how to get
[1:17:33] the car to run and instead of trying to
[1:17:36] work it up and try to fire it up amen he
[1:17:38] just yielded to the voice and said if
[1:17:41] you said that's the way it does that's
[1:17:43] what we're going to do I'm on Grace
[1:17:44] Tabernacle you want to break out in
[1:17:46] Revival that the cold days won't shut up

[1:18:09] to shout if the pastor is out of town
[1:18:12] you'll be able to pull if you are
[1:18:15] sick come on church I'm talking about
[1:18:18] somebody who has returned to the divine
[1:18:21] order of the word of
[1:18:23] God that's why the devil hates us we
[1:18:26] didn't walk away from light brother
[1:18:28] Travis we stepped in the light and we're
[1:18:30] walking with the light we're progressing
[1:18:32] with a lot we now know how to baptize we
[1:18:35] know oh God we now know how to have
[1:18:38] communion we now know how to preach we
[1:18:40] know now how to sing why because we made
[1:18:43] due use of the
[1:18:47] opportunity now he said when theologians
[1:18:50] and people have departed from the word
[1:18:52] God always sent his servant to these
[1:18:54] people people but apart from the
[1:18:56] theologians now what's he going to do
[1:18:59] he's going to correct the false teaching
[1:19:01] and lead the people back to
[1:19:04] God I remember one time brother Mark I
[1:19:06] got in a confr not confrontation but
[1:19:09] we'll just say heated
[1:19:10] Fellowship Pentecostal preacher one time
[1:19:13] and he told me he said y'all just follow
[1:19:15] a man see you got to have a man to do
[1:19:17] everything you say do I said really' he
[1:19:20] said yeah he said' that's why you got
[1:19:21] all them books and tapes is because you
[1:19:22] rely on a man more than you do god' I
[1:19:25] said oh really I said how do you baptize
[1:19:28] he said acts 238 he said how do you
[1:19:30] baptize I said acts
[1:19:33] 238 he said well that's Bible I said
[1:19:35] exactly I said how do you believe
[1:19:37] somebody gets the Holy Ghost he said
[1:19:39] speak in tongues I said how do you prove
[1:19:41] that he said well Bishop so and so in
[1:19:43] the 50s in the Pentecostal Council I
[1:19:46] said hi I got
[1:19:47] you he said how do you believe the Holy
[1:19:50] Ghost I said John 17 and John 14 and
[1:19:53] John 16 and John 15 when he the spirit
[1:19:56] of Truth has come he will receive the
[1:19:59] truth and how can the Holy Ghost come to
[1:20:01] confirm the truth and then you deny what
[1:20:04] the Holy Ghost has come to confirm he
[1:20:06] said so you mean speaking in tongues is
[1:20:07] not the evidence of Holy Ghost I said it
[1:20:09] is if you put a man over the
[1:20:10] interpretation of it but if you put God
[1:20:13] through a word born Prophet over it
[1:20:15] you'll come back to John 14 you'll come
[1:20:18] back to John 15 you'll come back to John
[1:20:20] 16 and say he is the spirit of Truth he
[1:20:23] is the god and he is the comforter and
[1:20:26] he is the headship of my
[1:20:28] life see remember Ezekiel y'all remember
[1:20:31] Ezekiel in the valley of dry bones can
[1:20:33] you give me exod or Ezekiel 3711 sorry I
[1:20:36] love this Ezekiel 3711 he said then he
[1:20:39] said unto me amen son of man amen these
[1:20:42] bones are the whole house of Israel he
[1:20:45] looks at the bones and he says see
[1:20:48] they're the whole house of Israel right
[1:20:50] now watch what he says behold they say
[1:20:53] our
[1:20:56] behold they say our bones amen are dried
[1:20:59] up and our hope is lost we are cut off
[1:21:03] amen for our parts listen they're in a
[1:21:07] Ezekiel is seeing a vision over this
[1:21:09] valley of dry bones and Salem he looks

[1:21:15] back and they say these words they say

[1:21:19] gone our our members were cut off from
[1:21:22] them amen our bones are dry up I want
[1:21:25] you to see this word hope it is a cord
[1:21:28] it is an expectation it is the ground of

[1:21:33] the outcome in other words Amen brother
[1:21:36] Joe they're laying in the valley of dry
[1:21:39] bones and the bones are now saying

[1:21:44] that's right I'm not very smart okay I'm
[1:21:47] just a country boy from the hills of

[1:43:55] prophet can I say this to you it will
[1:43:58] take a prophet to straighten it out
[1:44:02] that's you say brother Andrew how can
[1:44:04] you say that can I have a few more
[1:44:07] minutes here because the Holy Ghost was
[1:44:10] bound Feast of trumpets go read it was
[1:44:13] bound by these denominational
[1:44:16] Rivers for some 2,000 years but is to be
[1:44:21] loosed in the evening time oh god
[1:44:24] brother Joe is to be loosed in the
[1:44:26] evening time amen under the evening time
[1:44:29] message are you hearing me amen I'm I'm
[1:44:32] I'm turning the corner now brother Bobby
[1:44:34] amen all the way 2,000 years brother
[1:44:37] Braham comes on the scene and what does
[1:44:39] he start doing he starts talking about
[1:44:41] what happened 2,000 years ago at Calvary
[1:44:44] and says that's a finished work amen but
[1:44:47] do you see between Calvary and then and
[1:44:50] now or between let me how uh how do I
[1:44:52] say this between Calvary and then there
[1:44:55] was denominational rivers that were
[1:44:57] blocking the Holy Ghost on one side of
[1:44:59] the
[1:45:01] atonement am I making sense honestly I'm
[1:45:04] asking you you've got the atonement
[1:45:07] you've got the holy ghost moving towards
[1:45:08] the people released from the atonement
[1:45:11] but then you got denominational walls
[1:45:13] that stop and the atonement and the Holy
[1:45:15] Ghost is on this side and the
[1:45:17] denominational walls here and the
[1:45:19] people's on that side so now they're
[1:45:21] going to psychology to get help and
[1:45:23] they're going to schools to learn the
[1:45:24] Bible come on church and they're
[1:45:27] studying through all kinds of man-made
[1:45:28] theologies and the church has filled up
[1:45:31] with it but in the end
[1:45:33] time behold I send you Elijah the
[1:45:36] prophet and he's not going to play footy
[1:45:38] under the table he's not going to
[1:45:40] politic around the table he's not going
[1:45:42] to play with denominations he's going to
[1:45:44] stand in the pullit and he's going to
[1:45:46] turn to Revelation and he's going to say
[1:45:48] that is a system it is the mark of
[1:45:50] the beast it is the enemy of God and in
[1:45:53] the name of Jesus Christ I resent it and
[1:45:55] he tore the wall down and Church of the
[1:45:58] Living God Brother Don there was a
[1:46:00] gusher of the Holy Ghost amen broke out
[1:46:03] in the people well I want to close by
[1:46:04] saying this this morning that Holy Ghost
[1:46:07] was liberated by prophets message and
[1:46:09] there ain't no devil and there ain't no
[1:46:11] preacher and there ain't no Theology and
[1:46:14] there ain't no feeling got any right to
[1:46:16] bind up the gusher of the Holy Ghost I
[1:46:19] say open the windows of Heaven Lord and
[1:46:21] let the Holy Ghost gush in Grace
[1:46:23] Tabernacle let the power of God let the
[1:46:26] waters run
[1:46:39] clear now brother B said this he said
[1:46:44] you're going to have it a few days in
[1:46:45] the book for me Church age book you know
[1:46:48] what I'm talking about church age book
[1:46:50] raise your hand you got church age book
[1:46:52] okay if you don't you need to get it
[1:46:54] it's a powerful book brother BR writes
[1:46:56] that book and he sent it to a man you'll
[1:46:59] hear his name on the tapes he sent it to
[1:47:01] a man named
[1:47:03] leil who was a who was a a a theologian
[1:47:06] best I can say it
[1:47:08] politely we'll move
[1:47:11] on so so brother Veil takes this because
[1:47:16] I said like this he takes this this
[1:47:18] church age book and I want to I want to
[1:47:21] say this in defense of of brother
[1:47:22] brandom brother Veil they brother veale
[1:47:25] did not write that book can we can we
[1:47:27] settle that it's not Lil's book it's
[1:47:31] brother brandom's book Lil grammar
[1:47:34] ised grammar ised is different than
[1:47:38] writing amen right say amen amen just
[1:47:42] kidding my wife's an
[1:47:44] author writing something and grammaring
[1:47:46] something that's different okay people
[1:47:49] say well you don't need to get in that
[1:47:50] church age book that's just brother
[1:47:52] veil's thoughts well you're looking at
[1:47:53] one preacher that's got enough backbones
[1:47:55] to say that's
[1:47:58] heresy you need to get in that book you
[1:48:01] need to take your Bible and you need to
[1:48:03] lay that church age book down side by
[1:48:05] side and you need to go through it and
[1:48:06] hear what a prophet said about the time
[1:48:08] of Gentile dispensation you're living in
[1:48:10] okay I don't know why I said that but we
[1:48:12] said it it's out there now let's move on
[1:48:14] so he sends what he calls an audio
[1:48:16] letter to Lil about the church age book
[1:48:19] and I'm going to close on this quote
[1:48:20] right here he says now in order to
[1:48:23] Proclaim this so what he's proclaiming
[1:48:25] the book he says in order to Proclaim
[1:48:28] this has to send a prophet in order to
[1:48:31] inject this to make this real again to
[1:48:34] show the people the hour we're living in
[1:48:37] because if they only see it in the hour
[1:48:40] past then there's no hope for the
[1:48:45] church if they only see the Bible in the
[1:48:48] hour past if they only read Genesis
[1:48:51] Revelation in the our
[1:48:54] pastor there's no hope for the church
[1:48:57] that's the church must see it in the
[1:49:00] present tense so God sends his Prophet
[1:49:04] to manifest the present tense of it
[1:49:09] y'all remember brother Tim sermon you
[1:49:10] got a road map you don't know where
[1:49:12] you're at how do we get from here to
[1:49:14] there you can't move you can't advance
[1:49:17] until somebody shows you where you're at
[1:49:23] so we're in this condition we're in this
[1:49:24] problem we're in this situation we're in
[1:49:26] this fear we're in this battle we're in
[1:49:28] this trial we're in this confusion we're
[1:49:30] in all this but then all of a sudden
[1:49:32] there's a man
[1:49:34] here who can turn on the
[1:49:40] light and when the light begins to Shine
[1:49:44] the Light brings
[1:49:48] opportunities can I say this and those
[1:49:51] opportunities are opportunities for
[1:49:56] miracles if a prophet hadn't come and
[1:49:58] turned on the light there would be no
[1:50:01] miracles in the
[1:50:03] church but he turned on the
[1:50:07] light brother Manuel do you realize if
[1:50:09] you go in a room and the room is full of
[1:50:11] roaches and there's no lights do you
[1:50:14] realize you don't go in there and stomp
[1:50:17] the roaches out and then turn the lights
[1:50:18] on
[1:50:24] you turn the lights on then you let the
[1:50:27] light do the work to identify the roach
[1:50:29] then you stomp on
[1:50:32] it God I feel like preaching all over
[1:50:36] again there's some
[1:50:38] roaches that's right there's some
[1:50:40] roaches that's right and they've crept
[1:50:42] in places they shouldn't be come on
[1:50:45] Church they've crept in play oh God
[1:50:49] they've crept in on your praise and they
[1:50:51] shouldn't be there they crept in on your
[1:50:53] Camp experience and they shouldn't be
[1:50:56] there come on now they crept in on your
[1:50:58] fellowship and they shouldn't be there
[1:51:01] they crept on your back in the word and
[1:51:02] they shouldn't be there so God turns on
[1:51:05] the light come on Church the light does
[1:51:08] the work the light reveals where the
[1:51:11] roach is and the light anoints you to
[1:51:13] put your foot on that devil and say
[1:51:15] you've crept in long enough well come on
[1:51:18] Church them roaches is crept in and
[1:51:20] crept in and crept in and they got you
[1:51:22] talking language now we can't get out we
[1:51:24] can't get out we can't get out but God
[1:51:27] has turned on the light rise up this
[1:51:29] morning and shine thy light has come and
[1:51:32] put your foot on the head of that devil
[1:51:35] and let the light of the Glorious gospel
[1:51:37] make the promises of God real again let
[1:51:40] our musicians come this
[1:51:44] morning

[1:54:18] challenge you or push you around on
[1:54:20] believing a prophet can I give you
[1:54:22] something can I give you
[1:54:25] something somebody say well brother I
[1:54:29] think it's a little far fets to say the
[1:54:31] only way the church can get straightened
[1:54:32] out is it takes a prophet but listen
[1:54:34] what what what he says God promised
[1:54:36] Malachi 4 for this last day and Malachi
[1:54:39] 4 has not yet been
[1:54:42] fulfilled uh don't put it up yet but can
[1:54:44] you get Psalms 341 ready for me Malachi
[1:54:47] 4 has not yet been fulfilled now this is
[1:54:49] 1962 but it must be fulfilled for it's a
[1:54:52] gered word of God spoken through Malachi
[1:54:56] the prophet you believe that Jesus
[1:54:59] referred to it do you believe that it is
[1:55:02] just before the coming of Christ the
[1:55:04] second time all scripture that has not
[1:55:07] been fulfilled must be before that time
[1:55:11] the Bible is to be finished the Gentile
[1:55:14] dispensation is to be finished with the
[1:55:17] church age when this anointed messenger
[1:55:20] arrives now can I can can I show you how
[1:55:23] he's going to straighten the church
[1:55:25] out he will plant the seed of the entire
[1:55:30] [Music]
[1:55:31] Bible Plum from the serpent to the
[1:55:35] messenger in the former Reign then he
[1:55:37] will be rejected by the people as his
[1:55:40] forefather John Elijah as was spoken by
[1:55:42] our Lord he comes back and says what we
[1:55:45] need today brother is show The Gospel
[1:55:46] seed of the word of the power
[1:55:49] resurrection of Christ The Living being
[1:55:51] that's living with us in us now present
[1:55:58] tense okay can I say this to you the way
[1:56:02] he corrects the church is he swws the
[1:56:05] entire word seed Bible in the
[1:56:08] church then when that seed begins to
[1:56:11] grow what does it do it takes over the
[1:56:15] way you handle every
[1:56:19] situation it takes over the way you look
[1:56:21] at things it takes over the way you
[1:56:25] approach situations can I say it to you
[1:56:27] like this in other words it makes you
[1:56:29] start and I didn't get to it but I'm
[1:56:31] going to say it like this it makes you
[1:56:33] start seizing the Supreme
[1:56:36] moment it makes you quit looking at
[1:56:39] Golden opportunities going by you it
[1:56:42] makes you grab them yes sir yeah but the
[1:56:47] only way you can do it is there's got to
[1:56:49] be a recognition that this is your time
[1:56:51] to do it and you can do it can you help
[1:56:55] me preach for a second can you look at
[1:56:57] somebody next to you and say you can do
