[40:04] we pray for these things now in [music]
[40:06] Jesus name we pray. Amen. Amen. Can't
[40:10] see.
[40:13] I sought the Lord
[40:17] and he answered [singing and music] me.
[40:20] He delivered me
[40:24] from every fear.
[40:28] [music] Those who [singing] look on him
[40:32] are radant. [music]
[40:35] They'll never be ashamed.

[41:24] my eneies. [singing]
[41:27] [music]
[41:27] Oh, son of God.

[42:19] An everending [music]
[42:20] praise.
[42:22] May our [singing] worship.
[42:26] Let us [music] bless the Lord
[42:29] every day and night.
[42:32] A neverending [music and singing]
[42:34] praise.
[42:36] We all worship.
[42:39] [music]
[42:40] Let us bless [singing] the Lord. How
[42:42] many can say I come to bless the name of
[42:44] the Lord. [music]
[42:45] Lord I come to glorify thy name. I have
[42:48] a revelation of the supreme deity
[42:50] [music and singing] of Jesus Christ. And
[42:52] a prophet said it opens a door unto you.
[42:55] It's a door into healing. It's a door to
[42:58] worship. It's a door to salvation. It's
[43:00] a door into the presence of the Lord. I
[43:03] come to bless the name of the Lord this
[43:04] morning. I say
[43:07] magnify [music] the Lord with me.
[43:11] [singing]
[43:13] Oh,
[43:15] exalt
[43:16] his name
[43:18] together.
[43:20] [music]
[43:21] Glorify
[43:23] the Lord with me.
[43:28] Oh, come exalt
[43:30] his name [music]
[43:32] forever.
[43:36] Oh, taste and [music and singing] see.
[43:40] The Lord is good
[43:43] [singing] and [music] blessed is he.
[43:46] Thank you, Lord.
[43:48] Who hides in him.
[43:51] Oh, fear the Lord.
[43:54] is all you [music and singing] say.
[43:57] He'll give you everything. Can somebody
[44:00] testify [music and singing] about that?
[44:02] And I say,
[44:05] [music] magnify
[44:07] the Lord
[44:09] [singing] with me,
[44:11] oh Lord. [music]
[44:17] [music]
[44:19] Glor.
[44:24] [music]
[44:32] [singing]
[44:34] [music]
[44:35] Oh my. Why don't you just exalt him with
[44:37] your voice? Why [applause] don't you
[44:38] just talk to him for a moment? Tell him
[44:40] how much you love him. Why don't you
[44:42] just thank him for his goodness and his
[44:44] mercy for watching out over your life.
[44:47] Go ahead. Oh, he he deserves more than 5
[44:49] seconds. He deserves more than 10
[44:51] seconds. Go ahead AND PRAISE HIM. WHERE
[44:53] ELSE ARE you going to praise him? I say
[44:54] if we come to the house of God, WE MIGHT
[44:56] AS WELL PRAISE HIM. WE MIGHT AS WELL
[44:58] WORSHIP HIM. WE WANT TO SAY, "LORD, I
[44:59] LOVE YOU, LORD. THANK YOU FOR YOUR
[45:01] GRACE. Thank you for your mercy. Thank
[45:02] you for the message, Lord God. WE WANT
[45:04] TO PRAISE YOU. WE WANT TO WORSHIP YOU.
[45:06] WE WANT TO LIFT YOU UP, LORD. I SAY HE'S
[45:08] present right here amongst us."
[45:11] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Amen. It's good to be in his
[45:13] presence. My May we just talk to him for
[45:16] a moment, Lord. how we love you, Lord.
[45:18] We thank you for your mercy and your
[45:20] goodness and your grace, Lord. Where
[45:22] would we be if it wasn't for your word,
[45:24] Lord, that come and rescued us out of
[45:26] the muck and the mire of the world,
[45:28] Lord? And you set us up upon a strong
[45:30] rock of revelation, Lord, that heavens
[45:32] and earth will pass away, but your word
[45:34] will never pass away, Lord. We thank you
[45:36] for Calvary, Lord. Thank you for that
[45:39] laying down of your life, Lord. That we
[45:41] could be forgiven, Lord. AND NOT ONLY
[45:43] FORGIVEN BUT WE COULD BE JUSTIFIED LORD
[45:45] THAT WE NEVER DID IT IN the first place.
[45:47] Oh what a worship should come up from
[45:49] our lives. What a worship should come
[45:51] from our mouths Lord of praise and an
[45:53] offering of sacrifice unto you. Lord we
[45:56] just love you and ask that you just come
[45:57] in a supernatural way this morning Lord.
[46:00] We've gathered together not to see man
[46:02] Lord but to see you the same yesterday,
[46:04] today and forever. Lord, and I just
[46:06] surrender myself to you the best way
[46:08] that I know how, Lord, to get out of the
[46:09] way that you can pick up these quotes
[46:12] and these scriptures and you can break
[46:13] the bread of life and feed your sheep as
[46:15] they have need of. Lord, we love you. We
[46:17] pray that you continue to bless our
[46:19] pastor here in this assembly. Lord, may
[46:21] they continue to further the kingdom of
[46:23] God until that last one comes comes in,
[46:26] LORD, AND WE'RE CAUGHT AWAY IN a
[46:27] twinkling of an eye. Lord, we look
[46:29] forward to that great catching away. We
[46:31] love you. We ask these things in your
[46:33] name, the Lord Jesus Christ. Amen. And
[46:35] amen. Amen. If you have your Bibles,
[46:38] we'll be reading out of Isaiah chapter
[46:40] 60.
[46:41] Just want to thank brother Matt for the
[46:43] invitation and brother Matt and sister
[46:45] Sarah for all the hospitality. We love
[46:47] them and their family. They're they
[46:49] become dear friends of ours and also
[46:50] each one of you. We love you and
[46:52] appreciate you. I say it's it's always
[46:54] awesome when you can come uh uh to a
[46:57] place and just know that you can have
[46:59] your liberty and uh uh uh know that
[47:01] you're you you uh you're well taught and
[47:04] believe the message of the hour. And so
[47:06] if we're quote heavy, well, we'll just
[47:08] be right at home.
[47:10] &gt;&gt; Amen. And and we love the message of the
[47:12] hour, which is Christ the word. And um
[47:14] and we don't want it to just be some
[47:17] some idea or something a far off. But
[47:19] but we you know, I just comes to my
[47:21] mind. Think about that story about that
[47:23] young boy when the lightning was
[47:25] flashing and the storm was going on and
[47:27] and he was crying for his mommy and
[47:28] she'd come up there and say, "You know,
[47:30] Jesus is with you." And he said, "Yeah,
[47:31] but mommy, I wanted I wanted a Jesus
[47:33] with skin on it." And you know, this
[47:35] isn't just some idea or some religion,
[47:37] but but but it's the very person of
[47:39] Jesus Christ. It's the person of the
[47:41] word. And so we we just pray that by
[47:43] God's grace, it'll become a greater
[47:44] reality and a greater revelation to you.
[47:46] Very familiar scripture, especially for
[47:48] the season and the time that we're in.
[47:49] Isaiah chapter 60, it says, "Arise and
[47:53] shine, for thy light has come, and the
[47:54] glory of the Lord is risen upon thee.
[47:57] For behold, the darkness shall cover the
[47:59] earth and gross darkness of the people,
[48:00] but the Lord shall rise upon thee, and
[48:04] his glory shall be seen upon
[48:07] &gt;&gt; thee." Amen. We ask a blessing upon the
[48:09] reading of the word. You may be seated.
[48:12] Amen. And just to uh for for a moment
[48:15] here to lay a foundation
[48:18] in here um brother Brandon would say in
[48:22] there is a man here that can turn on the
[48:23] light. He says now light well now the
[48:25] seed was already upon the earth. I
[48:27] believe God had planted the seed and
[48:29] just as long as the sun could get to
[48:32] that seed it began to grow. And that's
[48:34] the reason it only taken days to bring
[48:36] forth these things because the seed was
[48:38] already in the earth all it needed was
[48:41] light. And we can certainly see a
[48:42] parallel to our own lives that there was
[48:44] always a predestinated seed that was
[48:46] placed there inside of your life and the
[48:49] only thing it was needing was light. And
[48:51] that's the way God has today. His seed
[48:54] is already here. His word. The only
[48:56] thing it needs is light on it. And he is
[48:58] that light for he is the word. The word
[49:01] and the light is the same thing. The
[49:04] life in there is the light of the word.
[49:06] See is life. The germ of life lays
[49:09] within the grain. And the grain, the
[49:11] life is what breaks forth and brings
[49:13] forth the life out of the grain. That's
[49:17] the way uh that Christ in the word makes
[49:20] the word do what it's supposed to do.
[49:22] Just like the life in the grain of wheat
[49:24] or whatever it is, it makes the wheat do
[49:28] what it's supposed to do because it is
[49:31] the life that's in it. All life. So life
[49:35] is only by the word of God made
[49:40] manifest. Life comes only by the word of
[49:42] God made manifest. As long as it is just
[49:45] in the book
[49:46] &gt;&gt; like this, it can still be questioned.
[49:50] &gt;&gt; That's why a lot of people have
[49:51] questions.
[49:52] &gt;&gt; That's why a lot of people question the
[49:54] message and they wonder, is this right
[49:55] or is that right? As long as it's on a
[49:57] book, as long as it's on a tape, it can
[49:59] be questioned. But when it's made
[50:01] manifest,
[50:02] &gt;&gt; then you see the product of what is
[50:05] spoke of being manifested. Then that is
[50:10] light on the word. See, that's what
[50:12] brings the word says so. And then when
[50:15] it come to pass, that is life in light.
[50:18] Light bringing life. Light brings life.
[50:24] Amen.
[50:25] &gt;&gt; And if you'll just turn in your Bibles
[50:26] to John chapter 8. This is where we'll
[50:28] be just drawing for text as well. We
[50:32] only have one service. So, uh, we'll
[50:34] take our time. Is that okay?
[50:36] &gt;&gt; You know, and and, uh, you know, the
[50:38] same door you came in is still the same
[50:40] one. So, if we get a little long, you
[50:42] know, I this is voluntary,
[50:44] &gt;&gt; right? Right. I mean, no one forced you
[50:47] to come and and we're not going to force
[50:49] you to leave. So, just feel at home. Be
[50:51] be free to come and go. But I pray that
[50:53] God would have his will and his way and
[50:55] something would be said that could help
[50:56] you in your journey. So just uh look at
[50:59] this story here. I'll just take the time
[51:01] to read it. Everybody like reading your
[51:02] Bible
[51:04] &gt;&gt; and in John 8 and1 it says, "And Jesus
[51:06] went under the Mount of Olives and early
[51:08] in the morning he came again into the
[51:10] temple and all the people came unto him
[51:12] and he sat down and taught them. And the
[51:14] scribes and Pharisees brought unto him a
[51:16] woman taken in adultery. And when they
[51:19] had set her in the midst, they say unto
[51:22] him, "Master, this woman was taken in
[51:25] adultery in the very act." Now, I don't
[51:28] know about you, but all always when I I
[51:30] read the scripture or the message of the
[51:32] hour, I want to I want to see maybe a
[51:34] parallel or somehow that I fit into the
[51:36] story or or something that can relate to
[51:38] me. And we know that we were all born in
[51:40] sin and shaped in iniquity and all have
[51:42] sinned and come short of the glory of
[51:44] God. So, here they're taking this woman
[51:46] and they're saying they caught her in
[51:47] the very act. And you know, according to
[51:49] the law,
[51:50] &gt;&gt; that that's death. She's going to be
[51:52] stoned.
[51:54] &gt;&gt; And so now they're they're bringing this
[51:55] AND THEY SAY, "NOW Moses in the law con
[51:57] commanded us that such should be stoned,
[52:02] &gt;&gt; but what sayest thou?"
[52:06] &gt;&gt; Now think about it
[52:08] &gt;&gt; here. Here here's the word made
[52:09] manifest.
[52:11] &gt;&gt; And now they're they're they're bringing
[52:13] a woman who she's a sinner. She's an
[52:15] adulterer. She's doomed to die.
[52:19] &gt;&gt; Right?
[52:20] &gt;&gt; She It's over. She's finished.
[52:22] &gt;&gt; And now they're bringing her TO THE VERY
[52:25] WORD HIMSELF AND ASKING HIM, "WHAT DO
[52:27] YOU SAY?"
[52:30] &gt;&gt; This they said, tempting him that they
[52:32] might have to h might have to accuse
[52:34] him. But Jesus stooped down and with his
[52:37] finger wrote on the ground as though he
[52:39] heard them not. I like that.
[52:41] &gt;&gt; Sometimes that's what you need to do.
[52:43] Amen.
[52:44] &gt;&gt; Just just just don't even don't even
[52:46] listen to it.
[52:48] &gt;&gt; He says, "So when they continued asking
[52:50] him, he lifted up himself and said unto
[52:51] them, he that is without sin among you,
[52:54] let him first cast a stone at her."
[52:57] &gt;&gt; And again he stooped down and wrote on
[53:00] the ground.
[53:01] &gt;&gt; Don't you wonder what he was writing?
[53:04] &gt;&gt; I don't know what he was writing.
[53:07] &gt;&gt; I mean, what was he was he was he
[53:09] writing her name like he saw it in the
[53:10] lamb's book of life? I don't know. What
[53:12] was he writing?
[53:14] &gt;&gt; And they they and they they which heard
[53:16] it began uh uh uh being convicted by
[53:19] their own conscience and went out one by
[53:22] one. I I imagine if you know if we would
[53:23] do that when we get to talking about one
[53:26] another in the church and trying to
[53:27] condemn one another,
[53:28] &gt;&gt; we ought to ask, you know, who's without
[53:30] sin.
[53:31] &gt;&gt; And beginning at the eldest, even unto
[53:33] the last. And Jesus was left alone and
[53:35] the woman standing in the midst. And
[53:37] when Jesus had lifted himself and saw
[53:39] none but the woman, he said unto
[53:41] her,"Woman, where are those thine
[53:44] accusers?"
[53:44] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[53:45] &gt;&gt; "Hath no man condemn thee?" She said,
[53:48] "No man, Lord."
[53:52] &gt;&gt; And Jesus said unto her, "Neither do I
[53:54] condemn thee."
[53:56] &gt;&gt; Go and sin no more.
[53:58] THEN SPAKE JESUS AGAIN unto them,
[54:01] saying, now remember, they've come into
[54:02] the temple, and now this has taken
[54:04] place, and they've brought a woman uh
[54:06] caught in the very act, and now all the
[54:07] accusers have done done gone. He said,
[54:09] NEITHER DO I CONDEMN YOU. GO AND SIT NO
[54:11] MORE. AND NOW HE'S IN THIS TEMPLE, AND
[54:13] HE RAISES UP. And listen to what he
[54:14] says. And and Jesus spake again unto
[54:16] them, saying, I am the light of the
[54:18] world.
[54:20] &gt;&gt; He that followeth me shall not walk in
[54:22] darkness,
[54:24] &gt;&gt; but shall have the light of light. AND
[54:27] BROTHER BRANDON WOULD SAY THIS AS we
[54:29] continue to lay just a foundation in
[54:31] shalom. HE SAYS THAT THAT SON IS the
[54:33] word of God. In the beginning, God said,
[54:35] "Let there be light." And when the
[54:37] manifested word of God, when the word of
[54:39] God was manifested, there was light.
[54:41] First, God spoke it. What if it didn't
[54:43] manifest? Then it wasn't light yet. But
[54:45] when he spoke it and then it was
[54:46] manifested, vindicated. His word was a
[54:49] vindicated light come into existence.
[54:52] And that's the only way it can be done
[54:53] now is when the word is vindicated.
[54:56] God's written word vindicated then it
[54:58] shows light. It is a it's a portion is
[55:01] lit or put out for each age. And we find
[55:03] in the church ages, we find in the Old
[55:05] Testament church ages, each time there
[55:07] come a time for a certain manifestation
[55:10] of the journey, there was a prophet
[55:13] &gt;&gt; came to the earth and the word came to
[55:15] that prophet and he made that word live.
[55:19] And when the word was identified, it
[55:21] reflected God and there was the age,
[55:23] there was the light and that's the way
[55:25] light comes today. Notice how he says
[55:27] it. And that's the way light comes
[55:30] today. SO THE WORD CAME TO THE PROPHET
[55:32] AND THE PROPHET MADE that word live and
[55:35] it was the light for the age. And we're
[55:37] what we're wanting to SPEAK TO YOU ON
[55:39] THIS MORNING IS THAT light brings life.
[55:43] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[55:44] &gt;&gt; And the word is light. AND IN JOHN 1:6
[55:47] AND 7, HE SAYS, "THERE WAS A MAN SENT
[55:49] FROM GOD WHOSE name was John. The same
[55:51] came for a witness to bear witness of
[55:53] that light that all men through him
[55:54] might believe." So remember WHAT HE'S
[55:56] SAYING. HE SAYS, "THE WORD COMES TO THE
[55:58] PROPHET. THE PROPHET MAKES THAT WORD
[55:59] LIVE IN ITS LIGHT ON THE WORD. And and
[56:02] and JOHN JESUS WOULD SAY IN JOHN 5:35,
[56:04] HE SAYS, "HE WAS A BURNING AND shining
[56:06] light." And you were willing for A
[56:08] SEASON TO REJOICE IN his light.
[56:10] &gt;&gt; Now, you know, forgive me if we're
[56:12] laying a long foundation in here, but
[56:14] brother Brandon would say this LATER IN
[56:15] SHALOM. HE'D SAY JOHN WAS the light. He
[56:18] was more light than Elijah and them had
[56:20] Elijah. He wasn't ELIJAH'S LIGHT, BUT HE
[56:23] WAS ELIJAH in another form, vindicating
[56:25] the light. See, he was. AND WHEN JESUS
[56:27] COME, he said HE WAS A BRIGHT AND
[56:29] shining light for a season, and you love
[56:31] to walk in his light. See? And John
[56:32] SAID, "NOW I MUST DIM OUT. I must go out
[56:34] now. My light's finished shining. I must
[56:37] GO OUT, BUT HE must increase. He's the
[56:40] light." He said, "I am the light of the
[56:42] world." Amen. That's right. The same
[56:43] yesterday, TODAY, AND FOREVER. And he's
[56:45] still the light of the world. And what
[56:47] is he? In the beginning was the word,
[56:49] and the WORD WAS WITH GOD. WHY WAS HE
[56:51] THE LIGHT OF the world? If he'd come and
[56:54] said he was the Messiah and he didn't do
[56:56] like the Bible said that he would do the
[56:58] Messiah would do, then he wasn't THE
[57:00] LIGHT OF THE WORLD.
[57:01] &gt;&gt; SEE, it's the vindicated word that makes
[57:05] it the light of the world.
[57:08] &gt;&gt; So, so we KNOW THAT THE WORD MANIFESTED.
[57:11] WHAT WAS JESUS CHRIST? JESUS CHRIST WAS
[57:13] THE WORD. HE CAME be manifested AND HE
[57:16] WAS THE MESSIAH, THE SPOKEN word by all
[57:18] the prophets prophesying there's coming
[57:20] a messiah. He will be the word. And the
[57:22] word WAS MADE FLESH AND THAT WORD DWELT
[57:24] AMONG US. HE WAS THE ANOINTED MESSIAH.
[57:27] AND TO THINK NOW TO THINK THAT ALL THESE
[57:29] PROPHECIES HAD BEEN PROPHESIED. AND
[57:31] THERE WOULD BE ONE TO BRING FORTH THAT
[57:33] MANIFESTATION. THERE'D BE AN ANGEL THAT
[57:35] WOULD COME TO A YOUNG VIRGIN AND SAY,
[57:37] "UH, THOU ART HIGHLY FAVORED AMONG
[57:39] WOMEN."
[57:41] &gt;&gt; WHO, ME?
[57:42] &gt;&gt; I I'm I'm HIGHLY FAVORED. WHAT? WHAT? WH
[57:45] WHY ME? WHY? BECAUSE I'VE CHOSEN YOU.
[57:47] YOU ARE GOING TO BE THE VERY ONE TO
[57:49] BRING FORTH THE PROMISED MESSIAH. NOW,
[57:52] NOW THAT'S A STRIKING WORD. IMAGINE
[57:54] BEING A YOUNG GIRL AND AND SOME A
[57:56] STRANGE THING HAPPENS AND SAYS, "HEY, I
[57:58] WANT TO TELL YOU THAT GOD HAS SENT A
[57:59] MESSAGE AND HE HE'S WANTING TO LET YOU
[58:01] KNOW THAT YOU'RE DESIGNATED FOR A
[58:03] SPECIFIC PURPOSE THAT YOU ARE GOING TO
[58:05] BE THE VERY ONE THAT GOD WANTS TO
[58:07] FULFILL ALL THE PROMISES OF THE PROPHETS
[58:09] OF OLD."
[58:12] &gt;&gt; And I like how brother Brandon would
[58:13] point out in certain places she what was
[58:15] she doing? She was feeding on that word.
[58:18] And all of a sudden, WHAT DOES SHE DO?
[58:19] SHE GOES, "HOW CAN THIS BE?"
[58:22] He said, "The Holy Ghost will overshadow
[58:24] you."
[58:25] &gt;&gt; And I say, "Oh, PRAISE THE LORD GOD.
[58:28] IT'S NOT LEFT UP TO OUR ABILITIES OR
[58:30] SOMETHING THAT WE CAN MANUFACTURE OR
[58:32] SOMETHING THAT I can figure out and how
[58:33] much I STUDY THIS AND TIE THAT
[58:35] TOGETHER." NO, WHAT IT'S GOING TO BE BY
[58:36] THE HOLY GHOST THAT'S OVERSHADOWING YOUR
[58:38] LIFE THAT'S GOING TO BRING FORTH the
[58:40] Messiah.
[58:42] &gt;&gt; Amen. So, just laying in THIS FOUNDATION
[58:45] IN JOHN 16:7, IT SAYS, "NEVERTHELESS, I
[58:47] TELL YOU the truth." So, uh, what we're
[58:50] what we're seeing here right now, here's
[58:52] the word made manifest.
[58:53] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[58:54] &gt;&gt; Here's the Messiah. He's opening blind
[58:56] eyes. He's healing the sick. HE'S
[58:59] FULFILLING EVERYTHING THAT WAS
[59:00] PROPHESIED. AND NOW HE HE'S HE'S CALLED
[59:02] OUT THE DISCIPLES AND THEY'RE ALL
[59:04] FOLLOWING HIM. AND AND YOU KNOW, THEIR
[59:05] EXPECTATIONS. They're looking for a
[59:07] kingdom to be restored and to drive out
[59:09] all the ROMANS AND AND THEY HAVE AN
[59:10] intellectual conception of what they
[59:12] think the Messiah is supposed to do,
[59:14] &gt;&gt; right?
[59:15] &gt;&gt; Help me PREACH A LITTLE BIT. RIGHT? THEY
[59:17] HAD AN INTELLECTUAL CONCEPTION. AND THEY
[59:18] WERE THINKING, "OH, HE'S GOING TO DRIVE
[59:20] OUT ALL THE ROMANS AND HE'S GOING TO
[59:22] RESTORE THE KINGDOM." THEY HAD SOMETHING
[59:23] IN THEIR MIND AND THEY'RE FOLLOWING
[59:25] CHRIST. AND AND ALL OF A SUDDEN, THINK
[59:27] ABOUT THIS NOW. IN JOHN 16:7, IT SAYS,
[59:29] "NEVERTHELESS, I TELL YOU THE TRUTH. IS
[59:30] IT EXPEDIENT FOR YOU THAT I GO AWAY? FOR
[59:33] IF I GO NOT AWAY, THE COMFORTER WILL NOT
[59:35] COME UNTO YOU, but if I depart, I WILL
[59:37] SEND THEM UNTO YOU." COULD YOU IMAGINE
[59:39] THE DISCIPLES SITTING THERE AND HIM
[59:40] SAYING, "HEY, IT'S A GOOD THING THAT I
[59:42] GO AWAY."
[59:44] &gt;&gt; WHAT DO YOU MEAN IT'S A GOOD THING?
[59:45] WE'VE LEFT OUR WE'VE LEFT OUR HOUSES.
[59:47] WE'VE LEFT EVERYTHING. WE LEFT OUR JOBS
[59:49] AND WE'RE FOLLOWING AFTER YOU. WE LEFT
[59:51] EVERYTHING TO FOLLOW THE MESSAGE OF THE
[59:52] HOUR. AND NOW ALL OF A SUDDEN, YOU'RE
[59:54] TELLING ME IT'S PROFITABLE THAT I GO
[59:55] AWAY.
[59:58] &gt;&gt; HOW COULD I BE PROFITABLE? BECAUSE WHAT
[1:00:00] HE'S TELLING LIKE, LOOK, YOU YOU SEE THE
[1:00:02] SAME LIFE, THE SAME LIGHT THAT YOU SEE
[1:00:04] SHINING OUT THROUGH THIS BODY. THIS BODY
[1:00:07] IS GOING TO [screaming] GO AWAY. BUT
[1:00:08] LOOK, I'M WANTING TO SEND THAT SAME
[1:00:10] LIGHT, THAT SAME LIFE, BECAUSE I NO
[1:00:12] LONGER WANT TO JUST USE THE CORPORAL
[1:00:14] BODY, BUT I WANT TO USE YOUR BODY. I
[1:00:17] WANT MY LIGHT TO NOW BE SHINING OUT
[1:00:19] THROUGH YOUR [screaming] LIFE. I HAVE A
[1:00:20] MANY MEMBERED BRIDE BODY THAT I WANT TO
[1:00:22] EXPRESS MYSELF THROUGH.
[1:00:25] &gt;&gt; It's better. IT'S PROFITABLE THAT I GO
[1:00:27] AWAY.
[1:00:29] &gt;&gt; The prophet of God said he only has
[1:00:30] hands as you yield your hands.
[1:00:32] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:00:32] &gt;&gt; He only has a mouth AS YOU YIELD YOUR
[1:00:34] MOUTH AND YOUR EYES AS YOU YIELD YOUR
[1:00:36] EYES AND A VOICE AS YOU YIELD YOUR VOICE
[1:00:38] TO HIM. AND THEN WE BECOME A COMPLETE
[1:00:40] YIELDED VESSEL. Then the Holy Spirit
[1:00:42] speaks through us.
[1:00:46] Brother Brandham in the trial he he he
[1:00:48] says this. He says, "I challenge you to
[1:00:50] believe that Jesus Christ is revealed in
[1:00:51] the form of the son of man in human
[1:00:53] FLESH IN THE BRIDE'S BODY. Accept his
[1:00:57] call." I want to tell you, he's calling
[1:00:59] YOU TO MORE FAITH. HE'S CALLING YOU TO
[1:01:01] HIGHER HEIGHTS. HE'S CALLING YOU TO
[1:01:03] DEEPER DEPTHS. HE'S CALLING YOU INTO the
[1:01:05] the fullness of the revealed WORD OF THE
[1:01:07] HOUR. HE HE'S COME. WE'VE HEARD THE
[1:01:09] COUNTDOWN. HE SAID, "THIS IS THE AGE OF
[1:01:11] SPIRITUAL ASTRONAUTS. WE'RE GOING
[1:01:13] HIGHER. We can believe more.
[1:01:16] &gt;&gt; We go HIGHER THAN ANY AGE HAS EVER GONE.
[1:01:18] COME ON. WE'RE NOT JUST HERE JUST TO GET
[1:01:20] INTO A ROUTINE AND AND JUST GET IN. OH,
[1:01:22] I GOT MY JOB AND I AND I PUNCH A CLOCK
[1:01:25] FROM 8 to 5 and I come home and and I
[1:01:27] take care of the family and I go to
[1:01:28] church on WEDNESDAY AND SUNDAY. AND
[1:01:30] THAT'S JUST WHAT CHRISTIANS DO. AND
[1:01:31] YOU'RE JUST IN A IN A ROUTINE AND A
[1:01:33] GRIND. I WANT TO TELL YOU THAT THERE
[1:01:35] THERE'S SPIRITUAL FOOD THAT'S STORED UP.
[1:01:37] YOU OUGHT TO BE FEEDING ON THAT MANA.
[1:01:39] AND I SAY THERE'S REVELATION TO BREAK
[1:01:41] UNTO YOU. AND WE CAN GO HIGHER AND
[1:01:43] HIGHER AND HIGHER. OH, THERE'S MORE
[1:01:45] THERE'S GREATER DEPTHS. THERE'S MORE
[1:01:47] HEIGHTS. OH, YOU CAN SOAR ABOVE ALL THE
[1:01:49] DARKNESS AND AND ALL THE CALAMITY OF THE
[1:01:51] AGE. I TELL YOU, IF YOU'LL JUST TAP INTO
[1:01:53] THE MESSAGE, IT'S AN INEXHAUSTIBLE
[1:01:55] FOUNTAIN. YOU CAN'T EXHAUST THIS.
[1:01:57] ABSOLUTELY.
[1:02:01] &gt;&gt; I I love how what we heard just brother
[1:02:04] Andrew bringing in the new year. How you
[1:02:06] know I want to say that this is this is
[1:02:08] something worth contending for
[1:02:11] &gt;&gt; and this IS THE APPROPRIATE TIME. THIS
[1:02:13] THIS AIN'T JUST TIME TO TO SAY WELL I
[1:02:15] GOT THE MESSAGE OF THE HOUR JUST LIKE HE
[1:02:17] WAS SHOWING HOW YOU KNOW YOU CAN YOU CAN
[1:02:18] MAYBE HAVE A HOUSE OR or or you CAN HAVE
[1:02:21] SOMETHING BUT BUT IT'S TIME TO move into
[1:02:23] that thing LIKE HE WAS PREACHING ON.
[1:02:25] IT'S MOVING READY. I WANT TO TELL YOU
[1:02:27] THE THE MESSAGE OF THE HOUR. IT'S TIME
[1:02:28] TO MOVE INTO THE PROMISES OF GOD. I SAY
[1:02:30] WE'RE LIVING SO FAR BEYOND OUR
[1:02:32] PRIVILEGES AND AND WE LET FEAR AND
[1:02:34] SITUATIONS BIND US. AND I WANT TO JUST
[1:02:36] TELL YOU THE TH THOSE SITUATIONS IN YOUR
[1:02:38] LIFE ARE JUST OPPORTUNITY FOR YOU TO
[1:02:40] TAKE GOD AT HIS WORD AND SAY, "LORD, YOU
[1:02:43] SAID IN YOUR WORD THAT BY YOUR STRIPES,
[1:02:45] LORD, YOU SAID YOU'D GIVE ME MY HEART'S
[1:02:46] DESIRE ACCORDING TO THE WORD." IT AIN'T
[1:02:48] TIME TO BACK UP. IT AIN'T TIME TO
[1:02:49] RETREAT. IT AIN'T TIME TO SAY, "OH, MY
[1:02:51] FAMILY'S A MESS AND THIS IS THAT AND
[1:02:53] THAT'S THAT AND AND EVERYTHING'S GOING
[1:02:55] WRONG." BUT IT'S TIME TO STAND UP ON THE
[1:02:57] REVEALED WORD OF THE IR. DEVIL, YOU BACK
[1:02:59] UP. I GOT A PROMISE. GOD, GIVE ME A
[1:03:01] MESSAGE. AND THIS IS MY PROMISE. THIS IS
[1:03:04] MY INHERITANCE. I'LL CLAIM MY FAMILY.
[1:03:06] I'LL CLAIM MY DAUGHTERS. I'LL CLAIM MY
[1:03:07] SON. I'LL CLAIM MY HUSBAND, my wife.
[1:03:09] Whatever it is, I SAY IT'S TIME TO
[1:03:11] CHARGE.
[1:03:15] &gt;&gt; It's not time to retreat.
[1:03:18] &gt;&gt; I say it's worth contending for. Amen.
[1:03:21] &gt;&gt; Brother Brandham said, "Not just
[1:03:22] half-heartedly, but with all your soul
[1:03:24] and might.
[1:03:25] &gt;&gt; Contend for the faith that was once
[1:03:27] delivered to the saints."
[1:03:35] &gt;&gt; He said, "You don't have to be smart and
[1:03:38] educated.
[1:03:39] You don't have to have an education. You
[1:03:41] just have to have a willing heart."
[1:03:43] &gt;&gt; God sends US FAITH DOWN. HIS POWER.
[1:03:45] Faith is power. And we're to in
[1:03:47] earnestly contend for it. Look, I want
[1:03:49] to TELL YOU, WE'RE NOT WE'RE NOT
[1:03:50] CONTENDING FOR SOME WATERED DOWN,
[1:03:53] WISHY-WASHY, SPINELESS GOSPEL THAT WHERE
[1:03:56] YOU JUST, YOU KNOW, WELL, WE WE'RE
[1:03:57] MESSAGE BELIEVERS AND, you know,
[1:03:59] everybody else is having their fun and
[1:04:00] having, but I got to wear a long dress
[1:04:02] and and I can't listen to worldly music
[1:04:04] and and you know, and then, you know,
[1:04:06] they're they're you know, THE
[1:04:07] PENTECOSTAL SURE, THEY JUMP AND they
[1:04:09] rejoice and they HAVE A GOOD TIME, BUT
[1:04:11] YOU KNOW, I'M OVER HERE. I'M JUST
[1:04:12] STRUGGLING ALONG. I'M TELLING YOU, YOU
[1:04:14] GOT THE WRONG MESSAGE. YOU'VE HEARD THE
[1:04:15] WRONG WORD BECAUSE THIS MESSAGE HAS
[1:04:17] POWER. IT is full of joy. It's full of
[1:04:20] peace. It's full of salvation. It has
[1:04:22] everything that you've ever needed. I
[1:04:24] WANT TO TELL YOU THIS MESSAGE IS
[1:04:25] EVERYTHING THAT I EVER NEEDED. AND IT'S
[1:04:27] SO MUCH MORE THAN I even KNOW THAT IT
[1:04:29] IS. THIS MESSAGE HAS POWER. IT HAS LIFE.
[1:04:32] IT HAS VICTORY. IT HAS JOY.
[1:04:34] &gt;&gt; I SAY IT'S WORTH FIGHTING FOR. IT'S
[1:04:36] WORTH CONTENDING FOR. IT'S WORTH
[1:04:37] BELIEVING. I WANT TO SAY THE MESSAGE IS
[1:04:39] WORTH LIVING FOR AND IT'S WORTH DYING
[1:04:41] FOR. AMEN.
[1:04:44] &gt;&gt; JESUS SAID IN JOHN 6:63, "IT IS THE
[1:04:46] SPIRIT THAT QUICKENTH. The flesh
[1:04:48] profitth NOTHING, BUT THE WORDS THAT I
[1:04:50] SPEAK UNTO YOU, they are spirit and they
[1:04:53] are life."
[1:04:54] &gt;&gt; Now, I just want to focus ON THIS QUOTE
[1:04:56] BROTHER BRANDHAM said real uh HE SAYS,
[1:04:58] "THERE IS NOTHING can give you life but
[1:05:01] the spoken word of God."
[1:05:04] &gt;&gt; It's the only way that life can come is
[1:05:08] through his spoken word.
[1:05:11] All right. You see YOU SEE THE PATTERN.
[1:05:13] REMEMBER HE SAYS HE SENDS A PROPHET WITH
[1:05:16] A WORD FOR A SPECIFIC MANIFESTATION OF
[1:05:18] THE JOURNEY. WE ARE IN THE PART of the
[1:05:21] manifestation of the journey OF THE
[1:05:22] CHANGE OF OUR BODIES IN A RAPTURE. AND
[1:05:25] GOD HAS SENT A SPOKEN WORD ACCORDING TO
[1:05:28] A VINDICATED PROPHET TO BE LIGHT UPON
[1:05:30] THE WORD TO BRING THAT LIFE THAT'S
[1:05:32] INSIDE OF YOU IN SEED FORM INTO A
[1:05:35] VINDICATION OF THE REALITY OF WHAT WAS
[1:05:37] SPOKEN. NOW, THAT MIGHT SOUND GREEK TO
[1:05:39] YOU, BUT I JUST KNOW WHAT A PROPHET
[1:05:41] SPOKE. I DON'T KNOW HOW I'M GOING TO DO
[1:05:42] IT. NEITHER DID Mary know how she was
[1:05:44] going to do it.
[1:05:46] &gt;&gt; BUT WHAT DID SHE SAY? BE IT UNTO ME
[1:05:48] ACCORDING TO YOUR WORD.
[1:05:49] &gt;&gt; I DON'T KNOW HOW MY BODY'S GOING TO BE
[1:05:51] CHANGED. I DON'T KNOW HOW I'M GOING TO
[1:05:53] GO A RAPTURE IF WE GO BY THE WAY OF THE
[1:05:55] GRAVE THROUGH a fire in a IN A SEA. I
[1:05:57] DON'T KNOW WHAT IT WAS. BUT I TELL YOU
[1:05:59] ONE THING, ALL I KNOW IS I'M COMING UP.
[1:06:02] &gt;&gt; I I can't SCIENTIFICALLY PROVE IT. I
[1:06:04] CAN'T TELL YOU HOW THE BURN THE BUSH WAS
[1:06:06] ON FIRE AND IT DIDN'T BURN. I CAN'T
[1:06:08] EXPLAIN TO ALL THESE THINGS, BUT ONE
[1:06:09] THING I CAN TELL YOU IS WITH ALL OF MY
[1:06:11] HEART, I BELIEVE IT. I DON'T KNOW HOW
[1:06:13] IT'S GOING TO HAPPEN. JUST LIKE ABRAHAM
[1:06:15] AND SARAH, THEY COULD SAID, "I DON'T
[1:06:16] KNOW HOW IT'S GOING TO HAPPEN, BUT GOD
[1:06:18] GAVE THE PROMISE."
[1:06:20] &gt;&gt; NOW, brother Brandham says this in
[1:06:22] shalom. He says, HE SAID, SEE, GROSS
[1:06:24] DARKNESS WOULD BE UPON THE PEOPLE, but
[1:06:26] there would be light. Rise and shine for
[1:06:28] thy LIGHT HAS COME. HOW CAN THERE BE
[1:06:30] DARKNESS AND LIGHT? IT'S GOT TO BE
[1:06:32] SEPARATED. AND THE ONLY ONE THING
[1:06:34] SEPARATES IT, THE WORD MANIFEST. It
[1:06:36] separates it. It presses IT TO THE OTHER
[1:06:38] SIDE. HERE'S THE DARKNESS ON THE EARTH.
[1:06:40] BUT WHEN THE MANIFESTED word of God, the
[1:06:42] sun, WHICH IS SPOKEN INTO EXISTENCE BY
[1:06:45] THE WORD, SHOWS ITSELF, DARKNESS runs to
[1:06:47] the other side.
[1:06:49] &gt;&gt; And that's what's taking place now.
[1:06:51] Darkness separating itself from light.
[1:06:55] THERE'S ONLY ONE WAY THE DARKNESS IN
[1:06:57] YOUR LIFE IS GOING TO BE SEPARATED OUT
[1:06:58] FROM YOU. IT'S BY THE SPOKEN WORD OF
[1:07:00] GOD. GOD HAS SENT A WORD. HE HAS SENT A
[1:07:03] MESSAGE TO START TO DISCERN THE THOUGHT
[1:07:05] INTENT OF YOUR HEART AND TO DEAL WITH
[1:07:07] YOUR LIFE CIRCUMSTANCES AND WHERE YOU'RE
[1:07:09] LIVING and what you're going through.
[1:07:11] AND IT'S LIGHT IN your life.
[1:07:14] &gt;&gt; TO SEPARATE THE DARKNESS, TO TAKE AWAY
[1:07:17] THE CONFUSION, TO TAKE AWAY THE CHAOS.
[1:07:20] &gt;&gt; NOW, WE'RE JUST MOVING TOWARDS A THOUGHT
[1:07:22] HERE BECAUSE NOW WE'RE THINKING ABOUT
[1:07:24] THIS LIGHT AND HOW JESUS WAS the light
[1:07:27] of the world,
[1:07:28] &gt;&gt; right?
[1:07:30] &gt;&gt; But now look at this change here. What
[1:07:32] Jesus would say in Matthew 5:14, HE SAY,
[1:07:35] "YE are the light of the world."
[1:07:39] &gt;&gt; A CITY THAT IS SET ON A HILL CANNOT BE
[1:07:42] HID.
[1:07:44] &gt;&gt; Brother Benamin Shalom says says, "WE
[1:07:45] ARE FROM THE NEW JERUSALEM."
[1:07:47] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:07:48] &gt;&gt; I tell you what, we ought to be that
[1:07:50] city.
[1:07:52] &gt;&gt; JOHN SAID, "I SAW THE NEW JERUSALEM
[1:07:54] COMING DOWN OUT OF HEAVEN LIKE A BRIDE
[1:07:56] ADORNED FOR HER HUSBAND." I SAY WE OUGHT
[1:07:59] TO BE THAT NEW JERUSALEM. BUT WE OUGHT
[1:08:01] TO BE THAT CITY OF MOUNT ZION. YOU ARE
[1:08:03] THE LIGHT TO THE WORLD. AND WHAT IS IT?
[1:08:05] WHAT DOES LIGHT DO? IT BRINGS
[1:08:08] &gt;&gt; LIFE. THEN YOU SHINING YOUR LIGHT. WHAT
[1:08:10] IS IT DOING? HOW IS LIFE GOING TO COME
[1:08:13] IN YOUR WORK? HOW IS [screaming] LIFE
[1:08:14] GOING TO COME IN YOUR FAMILY? HOW IS
[1:08:16] LIFE GOING TO COME AT YOUR JOB? HOW IS
[1:08:18] LIFE GOING TO COME INTO THIS WORLD? GOD
[1:08:21] HAS CHOSEN YOU.
[1:08:23] &gt;&gt; YOU are the light of the world. AND YOU
[1:08:26] MUST SHINE FORTH THIS GLORIOUS GOSPEL.
[1:08:29] AND THAT LIGHT SHINES INTO THE DARKNESS.
[1:08:31] THE DARKNESS COMPREHENDS IT NOT. BUT
[1:08:33] WHAT IS IT [screaming] DOING? IT'S
[1:08:34] SEPARATING THE DARKNESS FROM THE LIGHT.
[1:08:36] AND IF THERE'S A PREDESTINATED SEED OUT
[1:08:38] OF THERE, THAT LIGHT WILL STRIKE THAT
[1:08:40] SEED AND BRING FORTH LIFE. [screaming]
[1:08:47] &gt;&gt; YES, SIR.
[1:08:48] &gt;&gt; But brother Matthew, there's trouble
[1:08:49] everywhere.
[1:08:52] &gt;&gt; I mean, we we GOT OUR OUR PRESIDENTS
[1:08:54] GOING IN AND AND KIDNAPPING OTHER
[1:08:57] PRESIDENTS.
[1:08:59] YOU KNOW, and and all the other nations,
[1:09:00] they ain't happy about it. AND WE PEOPLE
[1:09:04] ARE PROTESTING THIS AND THAT. Some are
[1:09:05] sad, some are glad, SOME ARE THIS. I
[1:09:08] DON'T KNOW WHAT TO BELIEVE out there.
[1:09:12] &gt;&gt; You think staring at a LITTLE PIECE OF
[1:09:14] PLASTIC IS GIVING YOU THE TRUTH?
[1:09:17] &gt;&gt; D.
[1:09:20] &gt;&gt; You think CNN's telling you the truth?
[1:09:24] &gt;&gt; DO YOU THINK FOX NEWS IS TELLING YOU THE
[1:09:26] TRUTH? COME ON.
[1:09:27] &gt;&gt; WHAT'S YOUR TRUSTED SOURCE?
[1:09:30] &gt;&gt; Where are you getting your breaking
[1:09:32] news?
[1:09:33] &gt;&gt; Where are you getting your current
[1:09:35] events?
[1:09:38] &gt;&gt; Well, all I know is I got a trusted
[1:09:41] source right here.
[1:09:43] &gt;&gt; Oh, you want current events? WHY DON'T
[1:09:45] YOU PUT ON A TAPE AND HEAR? Good
[1:09:46] evening, friends.
[1:09:48] &gt;&gt; That's a trusted source. That's
[1:09:50] something you can rely upon. That's
[1:09:52] something that won't steer you the wrong
[1:09:53] way.
[1:09:55] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:09:56] BUT THERE THERE'S GROSS DARKNESS UPON
[1:09:58] THE EARTH AND AND EVERYTHING IT SEEMS
[1:10:01] LIKE EVERYTHING'S IN SUCH TURMOIL. BUT
[1:10:03] WHAT DID BROTHER BRANDHAM DO IN HIS
[1:10:04] RAPTURE MESSAGE? HE TOOK PSALMS 27 AND
[1:10:07] HE SAID HE SAID, "FOR IN THE TIME OF
[1:10:09] TROUBLE, HE SHALL HIDE ME IN HIS
[1:10:11] PAVILION. IN THE SECRET OF HIS
[1:10:13] TABERNACLE SHALL HE HIDE ME. HE SHALL
[1:10:15] SET ME UP UPON A ROCK." LOOK, WHILE THE
[1:10:17] WORLD IS IN TURMOIL AND EVERYTHING'S
[1:10:19] GOING ON, GOD IS CALLING YOU BY BY HIS
[1:10:21] WORD THAT YOU WOULD COME AWAY FROM THE
[1:10:24] DARKNESS AND COME AWAY FROM THE THINGS
[1:10:25] OF THE WORLD AND THAT YOU WOULD CATCH A
[1:10:27] REVELATION OF HIS WORD. AND WHAT IS
[1:10:29] REVELATION? IT'S the rock OF REVELATION
[1:10:31] THAT WE'RE STANDING UPON.
[1:10:35] &gt;&gt; Come on.
[1:10:37] &gt;&gt; IT'S IT'S NOT SOMETHING THAT'S
[1:10:38] INTELLECTUAL
[1:10:40] &gt;&gt; THAT YOU CAN BE TALKED INTO AND TALKED
[1:10:41] OUT OF. A LOT OF PEOPLE ARE TALKED IN TO
[1:10:43] BELIEVE IN THE MESSAGE.
[1:10:44] &gt;&gt; That's true. And you know, and and and
[1:10:46] it's amazing to me, you know, it's
[1:10:47] harvest time and and and and people are
[1:10:50] GOING TO SHOW THEIR COLORS. THEY CAN
[1:10:51] BELIEVE IT 20, 30 YEARS. AND THEN AND
[1:10:53] THEN BECAUSE THERE AIN'T some archive
[1:10:55] from the early 1900s,
[1:10:58] &gt;&gt; they walk away from the message. Well, I
[1:11:00] guess nobody died on a bridge because
[1:11:02] &gt;&gt; they didn't have smartphones.
[1:11:06] &gt;&gt; You know that THEY THEY THEY I MEAN,
[1:11:09] SOMETIMES IT TAKES MORE FAITH TO BELIEVE
[1:11:10] THAT.
[1:11:12] Like you can't even say like I mean you
[1:11:14] know it was a really small rural place.
[1:11:16] I mean could it be that the newspaper
[1:11:18] editor was on vacation?
[1:11:20] &gt;&gt; I mean
[1:11:22] &gt;&gt; I mean is it possible or or is it
[1:11:24] possible that God allowed it just to be
[1:11:26] that way
[1:11:28] &gt;&gt; so people like you would just well I
[1:11:30] give up. I can't live IT ANYWAYS. WELL
[1:11:32] YEAH THAT'S OKAY.
[1:11:33] &gt;&gt; You be you and I'll be me. And God SENT
[1:11:37] A MESSAGE TO TELL ME WHO I AM AND WHAT
[1:11:39] I'm supposed to be SO PEOPLE CAN GO ON
[1:11:41] LIVING AND BEING WHATEVER THEY WANT.
[1:11:43] LOOK, I ain't MAD AT YOU. YOU WANT TO BE
[1:11:44] A SINNER, BE A SINNER. YOU WANT TO BE A
[1:11:46] BAPTIST, I'M HAPPY FOR YOU. WE CAN
[1:11:47] FELLOWSHIP ABOUT THE GRACE OF GOD. But
[1:11:49] one thing I know, I'VE BEEN CALLED TO A
[1:11:51] HIGHER CALLING. I'VE BEEN CALLED TO GO
[1:11:52] IN A RAPTURE. I'VE BEEN CALLED TO
[1:11:54] BELIEVE THE MESSAGE OF THE HOUR. LOOK, I
[1:11:56] LOVE YOU. I'LL PRAY FOR YOU, BUT DON'T
[1:11:58] TRY TO TAKE ME AWAY FROM MY INHERITANCE.
[1:12:00] I'M GOING TO GO IN AND I'M GOING TO
[1:12:01] POSSESS THE LAND, AND I AIN'T LEAVING A
[1:12:03] HOOK BEHIND. PROPHET OF GOD SAY, "WE
[1:12:05] AIN'T GOT A HALFWAY RELIGION. I AIN'T
[1:12:07] GOING HALFWAY. I'M GOING ALL THE WAY.
[1:12:09] AND I'M TAKING MY FAMILY WITH ME. I'M
[1:12:11] TAKING MY BROTHERS. I'M TAKING MY
[1:12:13] SISTERS. I'M TAKING THEM ALL." WHY?
[1:12:15] BECAUSE THIS MESSAGE HAS POWER.
[1:12:17] [cheering]
[1:12:18] &gt;&gt; THIS AIN'T SOME WEAK, WATERED DOWN,
[1:12:20] WISHYWOSEL GOSPEL. FAITH IS THE POWER.
[1:12:22] AND FAITH COMES BY HEARING THE WORD.
[1:12:26] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH.
[1:12:27] &gt;&gt; IT'S WHAT I'VE BEEN CALLED TO.
[1:12:29] &gt;&gt; YES, SIR.
[1:12:29] &gt;&gt; IT'S MY INHERITANCE.
[1:12:32] &gt;&gt; And it's a revelation. AND JESUS SAID,
[1:12:34] "LET YOUR LIGHT SO shine before men
[1:12:37] &gt;&gt; that they may see your good works and
[1:12:39] glorify your father which is in heaven."
[1:12:42] Look, look, I LIKE TO SAY IT LIKE THIS.
[1:12:44] THIS THIS THIS book right here
[1:12:47] and [screaming] and the message of the
[1:12:49] hour AIN'T JUST GOING TO WALK OFF THIS
[1:12:50] PULPIT
[1:12:51] &gt;&gt; AND GO PREACH AT WALMART.
[1:12:54] BROTHER.
[1:12:56] &gt;&gt; THIS THIS THE ONLY WAY THAT THE BIBLE
[1:12:59] THE ONLY WAY THAT THE MESSAGE BOOKS THE
[1:13:01] ONLY WAY THAT THE MESSAGE IS EVER GOING
[1:13:03] TO GO IN AND PREACH
[1:13:05] &gt;&gt; or shine the light in Walmart, in your
[1:13:08] work, in your car, in your marriage, in
[1:13:11] your life, on your cell phone. Oh, don't
[1:13:13] go there, Brother Matthew. That's my
[1:13:14] safe place.
[1:13:15] &gt;&gt; Yeah, that's a lie from the pits of
[1:13:17] hell.
[1:13:18] JUST BECAUSE YOU CAN YOU CAN UH UH
[1:13:20] DELETE YOUR HISTORY and and YOU CAN GO
[1:13:23] INCOGNITO. YOU YOU CANNOT BE INCOGNITO
[1:13:25] FROM GOD. YOUR SINS WILL FIND YOU OUT.
[1:13:28] &gt;&gt; YOU THINK YOU'RE BEING SNEAKY AND GOING
[1:13:30] AROUND YOUR PARENTS UH UH PERMISSIONS ON
[1:13:32] YOUR PHONE.
[1:13:34] &gt;&gt; OH, WELL, it doesn't matter. I don't
[1:13:36] need permission. My friend got
[1:13:37] permission.
[1:13:40] &gt;&gt; You You THINK YOU'RE NO, YOU AIN'T
[1:13:41] HIDING NOTHING.
[1:13:44] &gt;&gt; YOU AIN'T HIDING ANYTHING FROM GOD.
[1:13:47] AMEN.
[1:13:49] &gt;&gt; YOUR SINS WILL FIND YOU OUT.
[1:13:53] &gt;&gt; But what do we want? WE WE NEED THE
[1:13:55] LIGHT OF GOD'S WORD SHINING OUT THROUGH
[1:13:57] OUR LIFE,
[1:13:58] &gt;&gt; IN OUR PERSONAL TIME, IN OUR PRIVATE
[1:14:00] LIFE, IN OUR HOME, WORK, CAR, LIVE,
[1:14:02] MARRIAGE.
[1:14:04] &gt;&gt; In the church,
[1:14:06] &gt;&gt; in the foyer,
[1:14:07] &gt;&gt; IN THE CAR,
[1:14:11] &gt;&gt; CUZ WHY? YOU ARE THE LIGHT OF THE WORLD.
[1:14:15] I LOVE THIS QUOTE. BROTHER BRANDHAM
[1:14:16] SAID, "GOD WAS BOTTLED AND CONFINED IN
[1:14:18] ONE MAN, JESUS CHRIST, BUT NOW HE'S
[1:14:20] BOTTLED AND CONFINED IN THE whole
[1:14:21] universal church of the living God."
[1:14:24] &gt;&gt; ISN'T THAT AMAZING THAT GOD IS CONFINED
[1:14:27] to his body?
[1:14:28] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:14:28] &gt;&gt; You see, brother brother Matthew, GOD IS
[1:14:30] CONFINED. YES, GOD CHOSE TO CONFINE
[1:14:33] HIMSELF TO HIS BODY. GO LOOK AT ALL THE
[1:14:36] PATTERNS THROUGH THE SCRIPTURE WHEN WHEN
[1:14:38] LOOK AT PAUL. HERE'S PAUL GOING ON THE
[1:14:40] ROAD UH UH TO EMMAS AND HE'S STRUCK DOWN
[1:14:43] BY THE PILLAR OF FIRE.
[1:14:45] &gt;&gt; THE PILLAR OF FIRE blind to THE PILLAR
[1:14:46] OF FIRE COULD HAVE GAVE HIM HIS CALLING.
[1:14:48] COULD HAVE COULD HAVE HEALED HIM. BUT
[1:14:49] WHAT DID HE DO? HE SAID, "YOU KNOW WHAT?
[1:14:50] I WANT YOU TO GO ON DOWN TO THE CITY
[1:14:52] OVER THERE. THERE'S A MAN BY THE NAME OF
[1:14:54] Ananas and he's going to pray for you
[1:14:57] &gt;&gt; and you're going to be healed AND YOU'LL
[1:14:59] RECEIVE YOUR SIGHT." THERE'S A MAN,
[1:15:01] CORNELIUS. WHAT WAS HE DOING? HE HE WAS
[1:15:03] PRAYING AND SEEKING GOD AND THE ANGEL OF
[1:15:04] THE LORD APPEARED UNTO HIM,
[1:15:07] &gt;&gt; RIGHT? He was EARNESTLY PRAYING. BUT
[1:15:08] WHAT DID THE ANGEL STOP? LOOK, LOOK, I,
[1:15:10] YOU KNOW, I I'M DEALING WITH PETER.
[1:15:12] PETER'S DOWN OVER HERE IN I WANT
[1:15:13] YOU TO GO DOWN THERE AND AND PETER'S
[1:15:15] OVER HERE AND HE'S UP ON THE ROOF AND
[1:15:16] ALL OF A SUDDEN HE'S IN A TRANSFER
[1:15:18] VISION, YOU KNOW, AND ALL OF A SUDDEN HE
[1:15:19] SEES, YOU KNOW, THE UH THE NETS COMING
[1:15:21] DOWN AND AND THE LORD SAYS, "TAKE AND
[1:15:23] EAT." And he said, "Lord, never I've
[1:15:25] NEVER EATEN ANY UNCLEAN THING IN MY
[1:15:26] LIFE." HE SAYS, "WHAT I'VE CALLED CLEAN
[1:15:27] IS CLEAN. THEREFORE, TAKE and eat." And
[1:15:29] there all of a SUDDEN THERE'S PEOPLE
[1:15:31] KNOCKING AT THEIR DOOR SAY, "HEY, is
[1:15:33] there a Peter HERE?" "YEAH." YEAH. HE
[1:15:34] GOES, "LOOK, THE ANGEL TOLD ME TO COME
[1:15:36] GET YOU.
[1:15:38] WHY? WHY? WHY DIDN'T THE ANGEL THAT WHY
[1:15:40] DIDN'T HE JUST GIVE HIM THE HOLY GHOST?
[1:15:44] &gt;&gt; He was seeking FOR IT. HE WAS ASKING for
[1:15:46] it.
[1:15:47] &gt;&gt; And God was gracious TO ANSWER HIS
[1:15:49] PRAYER. BUT GOD IS CONFINED TO HIS BODY.
[1:15:53] &gt;&gt; ARE YOU HEARING ME? OKAY. SO THEN WHAT
[1:15:55] ARE WHAT WHAT AM I TRYING TO SHOW? THAT
[1:15:57] GOD WANTS TO USE YOU.
[1:16:00] &gt;&gt; THERE'S SOMEBODY SICK IN THE CHURCH.
[1:16:02] WELL, WHY DON'T YOU GO PRAY FOR THEM?
[1:16:03] LAY HANDS ON THEM. BELIEVE. THERE'S
[1:16:06] SOMEBODY WHO WANTS SAVED AT YOUR WORK.
[1:16:07] IF YOU'RE HAVING PROBLEMS IN YOUR
[1:16:08] MARRIAGE, I WANT TO TELL YOU, GOD IS
[1:16:10] CONFINED TO HIS BODY AND HE WANTS TO USE
[1:16:14] EACH ONE OF YOU.
[1:16:17] &gt;&gt; Brother Bham said this in church order
[1:16:18] in 58. He says, "THE REAL WAY TO TESTIFY
[1:16:21] IS NOT IN THE CHURCH. It's out in dark
[1:16:25] places."
[1:16:27] &gt;&gt; Let your light
[1:16:28] &gt;&gt; shine where it's dark.
[1:16:33] &gt;&gt; Wow. Go to the road houses in different
[1:16:36] places and where sin and thing is
[1:16:39] heaping and let your light shine.
[1:16:43] &gt;&gt; There is the place to do it.
[1:16:46] &gt;&gt; Oh, COME ON YOUNG PEOPLE. YOU ARE NOT
[1:16:48] TOO YOUNG TO TESTIFY THAT JESUS Christ
[1:16:50] is the same yesterday, today, and
[1:16:52] forever. I tell you, WHY DON'T YOU TRY
[1:16:53] AT one time when you're checking OUT AT
[1:16:55] A GAS STATION OR AT WALMART, YOU LOOK
[1:16:57] ACROSS AT THE OTHER PERSON SAY, "YOU
[1:16:59] KNOW, I JUST WANT TO TELL YOU THAT THAT
[1:17:01] I love the Lord JESUS CHRIST. IF YOU'RE
[1:17:03] GOING THROUGH ANYTHING, I CAN PRAY WITH
[1:17:04] YOU AND I BELIEVE GOD CAN DEAL with your
[1:17:06] heart.
[1:17:08] &gt;&gt; IS THAT OKAY?
[1:17:10] &gt;&gt; BUT BUT ARE WE SO FEARFUL? ARE WE FOR
[1:17:12] SHY OR or or do we do we REALLY I WANT
[1:17:14] TO TELL YOU WHEN WHEN YOU GET SOMETHING
[1:17:16] THAT KNOWS THAT WORKS, YOU WANT TO SHARE
[1:17:18] IT.
[1:17:19] &gt;&gt; WHEN YOU GO TO A RESTAURANT, IT'S THE
[1:17:20] BEST ITALIAN FOOD YOU'VE EVER HAD. YOU
[1:17:22] WANT TO SAY, "OH, HEY, HEY, I I WANT TO
[1:17:24] TAKE YOU OVER HERE. THIS IS THE BEST
[1:17:25] ITALIAN FOOD I EVER I WONDER IF YOU
[1:17:27] REALLY GOT A REVELATION OF WHAT THE
[1:17:28] MESSAGE OF THE HOUR IS. I REALLY IF YOU
[1:17:30] GOT THE CURE, IF YOU GOT THE ANSWER,
[1:17:32] BECAUSE I WANT TO TELL YOU, IF YOU DID,
[1:17:33] YOU WANT TO SHARE IT.
[1:17:35] &gt;&gt; YOU WANT TO TELL SOMEBODY ABOUT IT. YOU
[1:17:36] SEE SOMEBODY IN A DARK PLACE AND LIVING
[1:17:38] IN SIN AND THEY GOT NO VICTORY IN THEIR
[1:17:40] LIFE, YOU CAN LOOK AT THAT SITUATION,
[1:17:42] SAY, "OH, GOD, I REMEMBER WHAT IT WAS
[1:17:44] LIKE TO BE THERE, LORD, AND YOU
[1:17:45] DELIVERED ME." AND YOU SAY, "WELL,
[1:17:46] BROTHER MATTHEW, I never went OUT INTO
[1:17:47] THE WORLD." I PRAISE GOD. YOU DON'T HAVE
[1:17:49] TO GO OUT IN THE WORLD. BUT ONE THING I
[1:17:51] WANT TO TELL YOU DO, YOU GOT TO MEET THE
[1:17:52] SAME PILLAR OF FIRE. YOU GOT TO MEET THE
[1:17:54] SAME LOGOS, AND WE WERE ALL BORN IN SIN
[1:17:56] AND SHAPED IN INIQUITY. YOU CAN HAVE THE
[1:17:58] SAME BAPTISM HOLY GHOST EXPERIENCE. YOU
[1:18:00] CAN BE CHANGED IN A MOMENT IN A
[1:18:02] TWINKLING OF NIGHT. DON'T LET THESE
[1:18:03] LYING PREACHERS OUT THERE TRY TO TELL
[1:18:05] YOU YOU AIN'T GOT NOTHING TO BE FORGIVEN
[1:18:07] FOR. YOU AIN'T GOT NOTHING TO BE
[1:18:08] CHANGED. OH, WE ARE ALL SINNERS. WE'VE
[1:18:10] ALL COME SHORT OF THE GLORY OF GOD. I
[1:18:12] DON'T CARE IF YOU'VE GROWN UP ON THE
[1:18:14] CHURCH PEW ALL YOUR LIFE. YOU NEED TO BE
[1:18:15] BORN AGAIN. YOU NEED TO BE FILLED WITH
[1:18:17] THE HOLY GHOST AND YOU CAN EXPERIENCE
[1:18:19] THE POWER OF GOD.
[1:18:24] &gt;&gt; WE GOT NONSENSE GOING AROUND NOWADAYS.
[1:18:26] THERE is a real power. There is a real
[1:18:28] change. There's real victory. There's
[1:18:31] real freedom.
[1:18:33] &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord.
[1:18:35] &gt;&gt; Listen to this. JESUS SAID IN MATTHEW
[1:18:38] 5:13, "YE ARE THE SALT of the earth,
[1:18:40] sir.
[1:18:41] &gt;&gt; But if the salt has lost its savor,
[1:18:44] &gt;&gt; other says, if it's lost its testimony,
[1:18:48] &gt;&gt; it can't cure.
[1:18:50] &gt;&gt; It can't be effective." Now, I know
[1:18:52] we're just laying in some some simple uh
[1:18:54] uh uh uh uh things here this morning and
[1:18:56] and but I'm MY HEART'S DESIRE IS I WANT
[1:19:00] US WE'RE GOING INTO a new year and and
[1:19:02] and look, we all have our lives and our
[1:19:04] families and and OUR CHALLENGES AND OUR
[1:19:06] TRIALS. Uh but you know what? You are
[1:19:09] the light of the world.
[1:19:11] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:19:12] &gt;&gt; And light brings life. Light separates
[1:19:16] the darkness. There there's a power THAT
[1:19:18] IS INSIDE OF YOU to bring forth life.
[1:19:22] &gt;&gt; Another man said, "Let our lives be so
[1:19:23] salty that others can watch the way we
[1:19:26] act and live that they'll want to live
[1:19:28] that way, too."
[1:19:30] &gt;&gt; Remember, he said, "AS LONG AS IT'S IN A
[1:19:32] BOOK, IT CAN BE QUESTIONED."
[1:19:36] &gt;&gt; You know, a lot of people question if
[1:19:37] he's a healer. A LOT OF PEOPLE PEOPLE
[1:19:39] QUESTION THE MESSAGE OF THE HOUR, YOU
[1:19:41] KNOW, IF IT'S REALLY WHAT IT SAYS. A LOT
[1:19:43] OF PEOPLE QUESTION. YOU CAN QUESTION ALL
[1:19:45] YOU WANT, BUT THERE IS NO QUESTION. I
[1:19:48] ONCE WAS LOST, BUT NOW I'M FOUND.
[1:19:51] &gt;&gt; I once was blind, but now I SEE. THERE
[1:19:54] IS NO QUESTIONS THAT THE MESSAGE OF THE
[1:19:56] HOUR IS THE LIGHT UPON GOD'S WORD THAT I
[1:19:59] MIGHT SEE. THERE'S THINGS IN THE BIBLE I
[1:20:01] COULDN'T UNDERSTAND. I DIDN'T KNOW WHAT
[1:20:03] IT MEANT. BUT GOD SENT A WORD BY A
[1:20:05] PROPHET THAT WAS LIGHT ON THE WORD FOR
[1:20:08] THIS PART OF THE JOURNEY. LOOK, THERE'S
[1:20:10] ONLY ONE WAY WE'RE GETTING OUT OF HERE.
[1:20:12] THERE'S ONLY ONE WAY WE'RE GOING TO
[1:20:13] ESCAPE THE JUDGMENT, AND THAT'S BECAUSE
[1:20:15] GOD HAS SENT A VINDICATED WORD BY
[1:20:17] MALACHI 4:5 AND LUKE 17:30 and
[1:20:20] Revelations 10 1-7. IT'S GOD'S PROVIDED
[1:20:23] WAY IN THE EVENING TIME. IT'S GOD'S
[1:20:26] LIGHT UPON THE WORD, AND LIGHT BRINGS
[1:20:29] LIFE. AND NOW THAT LIFE IS TO BE IN YOU,
[1:20:31] SHINING OUT INTO THE WORLD.
[1:20:35] &gt;&gt; Is that all right?
[1:20:37] &gt;&gt; Oh, but when that word starts to become
[1:20:40] alive in you,
[1:20:44] It's light
[1:20:45] &gt;&gt; and it's life.
[1:20:47] &gt;&gt; And now you can go into the highways.
[1:20:49] You can go into the byways. You can go
[1:20:52] into your church situation or into your
[1:20:54] work situation. You can look upon the
[1:20:56] needs of the others and then you can you
[1:20:58] can BE UH THE HOLY GHOST IN the
[1:21:00] situation.
[1:21:01] &gt;&gt; Lord, how do you want to lead me? What
[1:21:03] should I SAY? YOU KNOW, SOMETIMES IT
[1:21:05] TAKES UH UH THE LEADERSHIP OF THE HOLY
[1:21:07] GHOST TO NOT GET INVOLVED.
[1:21:09] &gt;&gt; That's right. And I would tell you, if
[1:21:12] we would be MORE SENSITIVE TO THE HOLY
[1:21:13] SPIRIT, we probably would get less
[1:21:15] involved in things.
[1:21:19] &gt;&gt; Look, there's problems everywhere.
[1:21:22] &gt;&gt; BUT WE'RE WE WE'RE NOT ALWAYS THE ONE
[1:21:25] THAT'S SUPPOSED TO FIX IT.
[1:21:26] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:21:27] &gt;&gt; And it MIGHT NOT BE THE TIME OR THE
[1:21:28] PLACE OR the season,
[1:21:32] &gt;&gt; AND SO MANY TIMES WE LET OUR RIGHTEOUS
[1:21:34] IGNATION GET WORKED UP AND ALL OF A
[1:21:36] SUDDEN, WELL, YOU KNOW WHAT? I JUST GOT
[1:21:37] TO GO SAY SOMETHING. I GOT TO DO THIS.
[1:21:38] JUST HOLD your peace. Yeah.
[1:21:40] &gt;&gt; Watch. Be in prayer.
[1:21:43] &gt;&gt; Wait for the time. Wait for the
[1:21:44] opportunity.
[1:21:45] &gt;&gt; And you know what? I found out a LOT OF
[1:21:47] TIMES WHEN WHEN I'VE OH, and it'll work

[1:22:06] for the opportunity, Lord, and I'll

[1:22:19] happened and that happened and you like
[1:22:20] oh my goodness I would have caused a big
[1:22:22] mess and a lot of a lot of times if
[1:22:25] WE'RE NOT CAREFUL YOU AND WANTING TO DO
[1:22:27] GOOD LOOK WE GOT A WHOLE service on it
[1:22:29] trying to do uh God a service without it
[1:22:31] being his will.
[1:22:34] &gt;&gt; I don't know why we're here. We're here
[1:22:37] &gt;&gt; BUT WE GOT TO GET INTO PRAYER. WE WE WE
[1:22:39] WE WE GOT TO WE GOT TO KNOW THAT YES,
[1:22:41] YOU KNOW, SOMETIMES I AM THE SOLUTION. I
[1:22:43] LIKE I TELL PEOPLE IF YOU GOT IF YOU'RE
[1:22:45] GOING THROUGH A PROBLEM, YOU'RE GOING
[1:22:46] THROUGH A SITU, SOMEBODY GOT TO BE GOD
[1:22:47] IN THE EQUATION.
[1:22:49] &gt;&gt; WE ALWAYS WANT EVERYBODY ELSE TO BE GOD
[1:22:50] in the situation. Well, man, if they
[1:22:52] were a message believer, if they're A
[1:22:53] CHRISTIAN, WHAT ABOUT YOU?
[1:22:55] &gt;&gt; MAYBE THEY'RE NOT.
[1:22:58] &gt;&gt; BUT WHAT ABOUT YOU?
[1:23:00] &gt;&gt; SEE, THAT'S THE PROBLEM. WE WE WE WANT
[1:23:02] TO WE WANT TO HOLD EVERYBODY ELSE
[1:23:03] RESPONSIBLE.
[1:23:04] &gt;&gt; THEY'RE A message believer. And if they
[1:23:06] really believe the message, they got an
[1:23:07] office. THEY LEAVE. THEY DO THIS AND
[1:23:08] THAT. IF THEY WERE REALLY A MESS, WELL,
[1:23:10] WHAT ABOUT YOU?
[1:23:12] &gt;&gt; MAYBE THAT THE TEST IS TO SEE WHAT YOU
[1:23:14] DO IN THE TRIAL. HOW ARE YOU GOING TO
[1:23:16] REACT TO IT? How are you GOING TO TREAT
[1:23:17] YOUR BROTHER? I WANT TO TELL YOU WHAT
[1:23:19] HAPPENS IF THEY MADE YOU MAD AND UPSET.
[1:23:21] YOU THINK THEY CHEATED AND YOU STOLE.
[1:23:22] What do you do? SAY, "LORD, I STILL LOVE
[1:23:24] THEM BECAUSE WHY LOVE COVERS A MULTITUDE
[1:23:27] of sin, but we want everybody else TO BE
[1:23:29] THE CHRISTIAN. WE WANT EVERYBODY ELSE TO
[1:23:30] BE THE MESSAGE BELIEVER AND OH, THEY DID
[1:23:33] THIS ME wrong and they did that wrong."
[1:23:34] And I tell IF THAT'S JUST THE WAY IT IS,
[1:23:36] THEN I'M GOING TO GET OUT OF HERE. I SAY
[1:23:38] THAT AIN'T NOT THE WAY to be. SAY, LORD
[1:23:39] JESUS, I NEED MORE GRACE AND MORE MERCY.
[1:23:41] LORD, HELP ME TO LOVE THEM MORE. HELP ME
[1:23:43] TO PRAY FOR THEM MORE. MAY MAY I BE A
[1:23:45] SUPPORT TO THEM. MAY I STILL BE THEIR
[1:23:46] FRIEND. LORD, YOU SAID LOVE COVERS A
[1:23:48] MULTITUDE OF SIN. I TELL YOU, THE BODY
[1:23:50] OUGHT TO BE JOINING TOGETHER. IT'S A
[1:23:51] UNITING TIME. THE WORLD'S UNITING OUT
[1:23:53] THERE AND ALL THE MOVEMENTS ARE UNITING
[1:23:56] OUT THERE. BUT I WANT TO TELL YOU, THIS
[1:23:57] BRIDE SHOULD BE UNITING AROUND THE
[1:23:59] MESSAGE OF THE HOUR. THERE OUGHT TO BE
[1:24:01] SUCH A LOVE, A CAPSTONE OF LOVE SETTLING
[1:24:04] DOWN UPON THE BODY OF JESUS CHRIST THAT
[1:24:06] WE CAN LOOK BEYOND OUR FAULTS. WE CAN
[1:24:08] LOOK BEYOND OUR FAILURES. WE CAN LOVE
[1:24:10] ONE ANOTHER. WE CAN PULL OURSELVES CLOSE
[1:24:12] TO ONE ANOTHER AND WE CAN BE CHRIST, THE
[1:24:14] LIGHT SHINING INTO THE SITUATION.
[1:24:20] &gt;&gt; God's confined to his body. You are
[1:24:22] God's agent.
[1:24:24] &gt;&gt; THE REAL WAY TO TESTIFY IS WHAT? GOING
[1:24:26] OUT INTO THE HIGHWAYS AND BYWAYS. OH, we
[1:24:29] we we IF WE'VE LOST OUR TESTIMONY, HE
[1:24:31] SAID IT CAN'T CURE, IT CAN'T BE
[1:24:32] EFFECTIVE, WE want to be salty
[1:24:35] because as long as we're we're just
[1:24:37] going by intellect and intellectual
[1:24:40] faith, that could always be questioned,
[1:24:42] &gt;&gt; right?
[1:24:43] &gt;&gt; And I want to say if you're in that
[1:24:45] condition this morning, I want to TELL
[1:24:46] YOU THERE'S A there's an experience here
[1:24:48] for you.
[1:24:49] &gt;&gt; AND NOT JUST JUST AN EXPERIENCE WHERE
[1:24:51] YOU'RE GOING THROUGH CYCLES OF REVIVAL
[1:24:52] AND DEATH, BUT A true born again
[1:24:54] EXPERIENCE WHERE YOU'RE BAPTIZED AND
[1:24:55] FILLED WITH THE HOLY GHOST. AND THERE'S
[1:24:57] no more question. IT ALWAYS REMINDS ME
[1:24:59] OF THIS TIME I WAS IN LOUISIANA CAMP AND
[1:25:01] OH MY the pre the Holy Spirit was just
[1:25:03] moving. You you could you could see it
[1:25:06] WAVES JUST GO GOING THROUGH THE YOUNG
[1:25:08] PEOPLE ALMOST YOU IT would just a move
[1:25:10] upon them and the the BLESSINGS THEY
[1:25:12] START UH CRYING OUT AND PRAISING GOD AND
[1:25:14] AND IT JUST WOULD SWEEP ALONG THIS WAY
[1:25:17] AND YOU COULD ACTUALLY WATCH IT COME BY
[1:25:18] AND I'LL NEVER FORGET WE WERE PRAYING
[1:25:20] WITH SOME YOUNG PEOPLE AND OH THE
[1:25:21] PRESENCE OF GOD HIT US AND OH MY IT WAS
[1:25:24] JUST SUCH A WONDERFUL THING AND ALL A
[1:25:25] SUDDEN SOME BOY THREW UP HIS HANDS. HE
[1:25:26] SAID, HE SAID, "HALLELUJAH. PRAISE THE
[1:25:29] LORD. IT'S NOT A STORY ANYMORE. It's
[1:25:32] really, really real." OH, I WANT TO TELL
[1:25:34] YOU THIS MORNING, IF IT'S JUST been a
[1:25:36] story that your your parents believe and
[1:25:38] they BELIEVE THE MESSAGE AND YOU'VE
[1:25:40] HEARD A STORY ABOUT JESUS CHRIST, I WANT
[1:25:42] TO TELL YOU THERE'S A POWER HERE TO
[1:25:44] SHINE INTO YOUR LIFE WHERE YOU CAN LIFT
[1:25:46] UP YOUR HANDS AND YOU CAN SAY, "OH,
[1:25:48] PRAISE THE LORD. IT'S NOT A STORY
[1:25:50] ANYMORE. IT'S REALLY, REALLY REAL. I AM
[1:25:53] FREE. I AM DELIVERED. I AM FORGIVEN. I
[1:25:56] DO LOVE GOD AND HE LOVES ME AND I AM
[1:25:59] FREE. YOU CAN BE SET FREE FROM THIS
[1:26:02] MORNING, FROM YOUR BONDAGE, FROM YOUR
[1:26:03] SIN, FROM YOUR SITUATION. THE LIGHT IS
[1:26:06] HERE TO SHINE INTO YOUR SITUATION.
[1:26:09] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. IT'S NOT JUST A STORY. WHEN
[1:26:12] that happens, oh my.
[1:26:14] &gt;&gt; Everybody else can question it, but you
[1:26:16] know,
[1:26:17] &gt;&gt; you can sing that song, you should have
[1:26:19] been there.
[1:26:21] &gt;&gt; You can say all you want, but I was
[1:26:23] there.
[1:26:24] I GOT A TESTIMONY. I KNOW WHAT I'M
[1:26:27] TALKING ABOUT.
[1:26:28] &gt;&gt; Everybody feeling okay?
[1:26:30] &gt;&gt; We just keep moving on a little bit.
[1:26:34] &gt;&gt; IN 1 JOHN 15 AND 6, WE WE WE know that
[1:26:39] when we say the message of the hour and
[1:26:41] we we speak of the message, we know that
[1:26:43] it is Christ.
[1:26:45] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:26:46] &gt;&gt; Right. Amen.
[1:26:48] &gt;&gt; We understand that God sent a word
[1:26:50] through a prophet.
[1:26:51] &gt;&gt; But that word in the beginning was the
[1:26:53] word and the word was with God and the
[1:26:55] word is God.
[1:26:57] &gt;&gt; And that word that was brought to us is
[1:26:59] none other than the fullness of the
[1:27:01] revelation of Jesus Christ.
[1:27:03] &gt;&gt; So when we say the message, it's not a
[1:27:05] hope so. It's not a think so. It's not a
[1:27:07] well I think it is. No, THERE'S A
[1:27:09] REVELATION THAT I KNOW THAT THIS IS
[1:27:11] CHRIST. AND IN 1 JOHN 1:5 IT SAYS, "THEN
[1:27:14] THIS is the message which we have heard
[1:27:16] from of him and declare unto you that
[1:27:18] God is light and in him is no darkness
[1:27:22] at all." [snorts]
[1:27:25] &gt;&gt; You know, contrary to popular opinion,
[1:27:28] there's no darkness and there's no error
[1:27:30] in the message of the hour.
[1:27:31] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:27:33] Now in your mind and you and and your
[1:27:36] ability to do spiritual math, you might
[1:27:38] come to a place well you know uh uh
[1:27:41] brother Brandham said this and this was
[1:27:42] that and everything. We you got to get
[1:27:44] beyond your carnal thinking. You got to
[1:27:46] get beyond reasoning and doubt. And of
[1:27:50] course people go one way and they try to
[1:27:52] make every word thus sayeth the Lord and
[1:27:54] then they try to make him a god and THEY
[1:27:56] I MEAN YEAH YOU'RE GOING TO HAVE ALL
[1:27:58] THAT YOU'RE GONNA have all that fallacy
[1:27:59] out there.
[1:28:01] But if we keep it as simple and
[1:28:03] understand that that this is the word of
[1:28:06] God to you and in the word there is no
[1:28:08] darkness.
[1:28:11] &gt;&gt; And if we say we HAVE FELLOWSHIP WITH
[1:28:12] HIM AND WALK in darkness, we lie and do
[1:28:14] not the truth.
[1:28:15] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:28:17] &gt;&gt; Brother Brandham says this, "IF YOU
[1:28:18] DON'T HAVE WORKS WITH YOUR FAITH, IT
[1:28:20] SHOWS YOU haven't got faith. You're just
[1:28:21] talking from your mouth."
[1:28:23] &gt;&gt; Well, hallelujah.
[1:28:26] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:28:27] &gt;&gt; Let me read it again.
[1:28:29] I'll settle in here somewhere. It's all
[1:28:31] right.
[1:28:32] &gt;&gt; He says, "IF YOU DON'T HAVE WORKS WITH
[1:28:34] YOUR FAITH, IT SHOWS YOU HAVEN'T GOT
[1:28:35] FAITH. YOU'RE JUST TALKING FROM YOUR
[1:28:37] MOUTH."
[1:28:39] &gt;&gt; WELL, that that that's that's that's
[1:28:41] good old uh uh trash talking of where I
[1:28:44] come from.
[1:28:45] &gt;&gt; You know, you get in the schoolyard or
[1:28:47] you're somewhere and somebody's running
[1:28:49] their mouth AND BE LIKE, "YOU'RE ALL
[1:28:50] TALK.
[1:28:51] &gt;&gt; YOU'RE JUST RUNNING YOUR MOUTH." AND IT
[1:28:53] SAYS, "WHY WHY DON'T YOU PUT YOUR MONEY
[1:28:54] WHERE YOUR MOUTH IS?" AMEN.
[1:28:57] &gt;&gt; OKAY. YOU SAY YOU'RE A BELIEVER, WHY
[1:28:58] DON'T YOU PUT YOUR MONEY WHERE YOU'RE
[1:29:00] RIGHT, THAT SOUNDS LIKE, BUT WHAT DOES
[1:29:01] THE PROPHECIES TELL YOU? LOOK, YOU SAY
[1:29:03] YOU BELIEVE IT, BUT IF YOU AIN'T GOT NO
[1:29:05] WORKS WITH YOUR FAITH, YOU'RE JUST
[1:29:07] TALKING FROM YOUR MOUTH. LOOK, THAT THAT
[1:29:09] OUGHT TO BURN and that ought to scold
[1:29:11] AND THAT OUGHT TO STEP ON SOME TOES. WE
[1:29:13] AIN'T GOT TO GET HIGH AND LIFTED UP.
[1:29:14] WELL, WE NEED TO SAY, "LORD, I'M GOING
[1:29:16] TO HUMBLE MYSELF TO THE WORD. I'VE BEEN
[1:29:18] DOING A LOT OF TALKING. I'VE BEEN DOING
[1:29:19] A LOT OF PROFESSING, LORD, BUT WHERE IS
[1:29:21] THE WORKS OF MY FAITH, LORD? MAYBE I'VE
[1:29:23] JUST BEEN TALKING FROM MY MOUTH. BUT OH
[1:29:25] GOD, I WANT TO CONFESS IT BY FAITH.
[1:29:27] LORD, I KNOW YOU'RE THE SAME YESTERDAY,
[1:29:28] TODAY, AND FOREVER. FORGIVE ME, LORD. I
[1:29:30] JUST DON'T WANT TO BE A TRASH TALKER. I
[1:29:32] WANT TO BE A LIVER OF THIS WORD.
[1:29:36] &gt;&gt; That way, WHEN THE DEVIL SHOWS UP, YOU
[1:29:37] CAN SAY, "BOO, DEVIL."
[1:29:40] &gt;&gt; NOT, "Oh my, what am I going to do? I
[1:29:42] better call the pastor.
[1:29:44] &gt;&gt; Pastor, fix my problems. Fix my
[1:29:46] marriage."
[1:29:47] &gt;&gt; You just need the Holy Ghost. Amen.
[1:29:51] &gt;&gt; You know, on the DAY OF PENTECOST WHEN
[1:29:52] THEY BUSTED OUT OF THE UPPER ROOM, THEY
[1:29:55] DIDN'T RUN TO THEIR PASTOR FOR
[1:29:56] COUNSELING.
[1:29:59] &gt;&gt; NOW, I'm sorry, brother Matt. YOU
[1:30:00] FORGIVE ME. I UNDERSTAND WE WE NEED
[1:30:01] COUNSELING. UH, AND SOMETIMES THERE'S
[1:30:04] SOME HARD SITUATIONS AND GOD HAS
[1:30:05] ORDAINED A PASTOR TO TO LEAD YOU AND
[1:30:08] GUIDE YOU AND AND TO HELP IN SITUATIONS.
[1:30:10] BUT, BUT I I COULD BE WRONG, BUT IF I
[1:30:12] WAS TO THROW PERCENTAGES out there, I'd
[1:30:13] say 95% of what he has TO COUNSEL
[1:30:15] DOESN'T NEED COUNSELING. YOU JUST NEED
[1:30:16] THE HOLY GHOST.
[1:30:19] Maybe I can speak for my home about my
[1:30:20] home church back home.
[1:30:22] &gt;&gt; Come on.
[1:30:22] &gt;&gt; Come on.
[1:30:23] &gt;&gt; BECAUSE WHAT IS THE HOLY GHOST? IT LEADS
[1:30:24] YOU AND GUIDES YOU INTO ALL TRUTH AND
[1:30:25] ALL RIGHTEOUSNESS. YOU HAVE DIRECT
[1:30:27] ACCESS TO THE THE COMFORTER, THE
[1:30:29] GREATEST COUNSELOR OF ALL TIME.
[1:30:34] &gt;&gt; BUT SO SO MANY TIMES WE'RE SO DEPENDENT
[1:30:36] UPON MAN.
[1:30:39] &gt;&gt; I KNOW GOD'S GOD'S AGE. I'M NOT TRYING
[1:30:41] TO TRYING TO CONFUSE ANYBODY HERE. BUT
[1:30:43] YOU SEE WHAT I'M SAYING? GOD WANTS TO
[1:30:44] USE YOU IN your situation, IN YOUR LIFE.
[1:30:46] YOU'RE GOING THROUGH SOMETHING IN YOUR
[1:30:47] MARRIAGE. I TELL YOU WHAT YOU NEED TO
[1:30:48] DO. GET ON YOUR KNEES AND PRAY WITH YOUR
[1:30:49] WIFE
[1:30:50] &gt;&gt; and say, "HONEY, YOU KNOW WHAT? THE
[1:30:52] ATMOSPHERE REALLY HASN'T BEEN RIGHT HERE
[1:30:53] IN THE HOME. SOMETHING AIN'T RIGHT. I
[1:30:55] FEEL A LITTLE FRUSTRATED
[1:30:57] and and and I FEEL LIKE THE KIDS ARE
[1:30:59] UNSETTLED. HONEY, YOU KNOW, WE GOT A
[1:31:01] DIVINE PROMISE. LET'S GET ON OUR KNEES
[1:31:03] AND LET'S APPLY THE TOKEN TO OUR HOME."
[1:31:06] AND I TELL YOU WHAT, IF YOU DO ALL THAT,
[1:31:08] if you get TOGETHER WITH YOUR WIFE AND
[1:31:09] YOU GET TOGETHER WITH THE KIDS AND YOU
[1:31:11] PRAY AND YOU APPLY THE TOKEN AND YOU
[1:31:13] MAKE SURE YOU'RE READING YOUR BIBLE AND
[1:31:14] YOU'RE LISTENING TO THE MESSAGE OF THE
[1:31:16] hour
[1:31:19] &gt;&gt; and YOU'RE WAITING ON THE LORD AND AND
[1:31:20] IT SEEMS LIKE YOU HAVEN'T BROKEN
[1:31:22] THROUGH, YOU KNOW WHAT? GO TO YOUR
[1:31:23] PASTOR AND THE PASTOR START TALKING TO
[1:31:25] YOU A LITTLE BIT AND YOU SAY, "WELL, YOU
[1:31:27] KNOW, HAVE HAVE YOU PRAYED WITH YOUR
[1:31:28] WIFE?" "NO." "NO." "OKAY, I mean, have
[1:31:32] you been reading your Bible?" Well, not
[1:31:33] not like I should. All right. I haven't
[1:31:36] seen you in church for a month. Yeah.
[1:31:37] I've been laying out. It's like, AND
[1:31:40] YOU'RE YOU'RE YOU'RE ASKING ME WHAT THE
[1:31:43] PROBLEM IS
[1:31:44] &gt;&gt; and how to fix it.
[1:31:46] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:31:47] &gt;&gt; WHY DON'T YOU START READING YOUR BIBLE?
[1:31:50] &gt;&gt; START PRAYING.
[1:31:52] &gt;&gt; START LISTENING TO THE MESSAGE OF THE
[1:31:53] HOUR.
[1:31:54] &gt;&gt; GET IN DESPERATION.
[1:31:57] &gt;&gt; SAY, "LORD GOD, I NEED YOU MORE THAN
[1:31:58] I'VE EVER NEEDED BEFORE. HONEY, COME
[1:32:00] HERE. LORD, HONEY, YOU FORGIVE ME. I'VE
[1:32:02] SEEN SOME THINGS I SHOULDN'T HAVE SEEN.
[1:32:03] COME ON. SOME OF US NEED TO MAKE THINGS
[1:32:04] RIGHT WITH OUR WIVES.
[1:32:06] &gt;&gt; YOU'VE BEEN ON YOUR CELL PHONES and
[1:32:07] you've been looking at THINGS YOU AND
[1:32:08] YOU WONDER WHY THE SPIRIT OF GOD AIN'T
[1:32:10] MOVING IN YOUR LIFE. YOU WONDER WHY YOUR
[1:32:11] WIFE IS ALL FRUSTRATED BECAUSE YOU'VE
[1:32:12] BEEN LOOKING AT PORNOGRAPHY on your
[1:32:14] phone.
[1:32:16] &gt;&gt; Well, I'm sorry, CHURCH. I'M TRYING TO
[1:32:18] GO ON A RAPTURE.
[1:32:20] &gt;&gt; I'M TRYING TO GO HOME. AND WE LET THE
[1:32:22] DEVIL BIND US WITH TECHNOLOGY AND WITH
[1:32:24] THINGS OF OUR OWN. AND WE WONDER WHY OUR
[1:32:26] MARRIAGE IS A WRECK. WE WONDER WHY OUR
[1:32:27] HOUSE IS A WRECK. WE WONDER WHY OUR
[1:32:29] CHILDREN ARE GOING THROUGH A HIGH HARD
[1:32:30] TIME WHEN YOU'RE LETTING THEM WATCH
[1:32:32] ENTERTAINMENT, MOVIES, AND ALL THIS
[1:32:33] STUFF CONTROLLING THE ATMOSPHERE
[1:32:35] [screaming] IN YOUR HOME.
[1:32:37] &gt;&gt; THAT'S THE TRUTH.
[1:32:38] &gt;&gt; MAYBE WE'RE JUST TALKING FROM OUR MOUTH.
[1:32:41] &gt;&gt; YOU FORGIVE ME. I I DON'T MEAN TO COME
[1:32:43] COME LIKE THIS, BUT I LET ME PREACH TO
[1:32:45] MYSELF A LITTLE BIT. I I KNOW THAT THIS
[1:32:47] MESSAGE HAS CALLED ME TO HIGHER HEIGHTS
[1:32:49] AND DEEPER DEPTHS THAT I CAN POSSESS
[1:32:51] THIS VESSEL AND SANCTIFICATION AND HONOR
[1:32:53] THAT THERE'S A REAL POWER AND A HOLY
[1:32:56] GHOST THAT CAN CONTROL MY HOME AND THERE
[1:32:58] CAN BE A REAL ATMOSPHERE OF LOVE AND
[1:33:00] LIBERTY OF THE HOLY GHOST IN MY ROOM, IN
[1:33:02] MY CAR, IN MY HOUSE, IN MY FAMILY, IN MY
[1:33:06] MARRIAGE. AND THEN YOU BRING THAT TO
[1:33:08] CHURCH.
[1:33:12] &gt;&gt; Now we going to have church.
[1:33:14] COME ON.
[1:33:15] &gt;&gt; WHEN SEE THE PROBLEM IS IS WE'RE ALWAYS
[1:33:18] ON THE DEFENSIVE.

[1:33:22] GOODNESS. THE DEVIL'S COMING AT ME OVER

[1:33:29] I'M GOING IN A RAPTURE.

[1:33:33] victory.
[1:33:35] &gt;&gt; WE'RE REALLY
[1:33:37] THAT'S NOT WHAT YOU'RE CALLED TO.
[1:33:40] &gt;&gt; YOU'RE CALLED TO TAKE the message OF THE
[1:33:41] HOUR.
[1:33:43] AND STAND BEHIND THAT WORD AS YOUR
[1:33:45] PROTECTION AND MARCH FORWARD.
[1:33:48] &gt;&gt; SATAN, get out of my way.
[1:33:50] &gt;&gt; I'm going in a rapture. I'M GOING IN A
[1:33:52] PROMISED LAND. YOU TRIED TO TAKE MY BOY,
[1:33:54] I'M TAKING HIM BACK. YOU TRIED TO BREAK
[1:33:56] UP MY MARRIAGE. I'M GETTING IT BACK.
[1:33:58] LORD, THIS IS A MESSAGE OF RESTORATION.
[1:34:01] I'M TAKING MY WIFE. I'M TAKING MY
[1:34:02] HUSBAND. I'M TAKING MY FAMILY. I'M
[1:34:04] TAKING MY DAUGHTER. I WILL NOT BACK UP.
[1:34:07] I WILL NOT SIT DOWN. I'M GOING TO MARCH
[1:34:09] ONWARD, CHRISTIAN SOLDIER, UNTIL EVERY
[1:34:12] PROMISE OF GOD IS MINE. AND IT'S YAY AND
[1:34:14] AMEN. BOO, DEVIL, BACK UP. THIS MESSAGE
[1:34:17] IS MINE. IT'S THE LIGHT OF GOD'S WORD
[1:34:19] SHINING INTO MY LIFE AND IN MY MARRIAGE,
[1:34:22] INTO MY CHURCH, INTO MY HOME, AND IN MY
[1:34:24] SITUATION, AND LIGHT BRINGS LIFE.
[1:34:30] &gt;&gt; IT'S TIME WE GO ON THE OFFENSE OF
[1:34:32] CHURCH.
[1:34:33] &gt;&gt; WE GOT TO START FIGHTING FOR OUR
[1:34:35] BROTHERS, [screaming] FIGHTING FOR OUR
[1:34:36] PASTOR.
[1:34:39] FIGHTING FOR OUR LOVED ONES.
[1:34:44] &gt;&gt; It's like
[1:34:46] It's like we got called on.
[1:34:48] &gt;&gt; Well, I better go pray.
[1:34:51] Don't call me Please don't call me to
[1:34:53] open the service in prayer. I haven't
[1:34:55] even prayed at home yet.
[1:34:58] Dear Lord, uh [sighs]
[1:35:01] you can tell I hadn't done this in a
[1:35:03] while.
[1:35:04] And uh,
[1:35:07] &gt;&gt; hey, it's all right. I'm talking where
[1:35:08] we're living.
[1:35:09] &gt;&gt; Come on. We we we got to get over this
[1:35:11] facade.
[1:35:13] &gt;&gt; You know, we're all these perfect angels
[1:35:15] fluttering around.
[1:35:17] &gt;&gt; We got some real life situations and
[1:35:19] some real problems. And I said, what we
[1:35:21] really need to be is honest with
[1:35:22] ourselves.
[1:35:24] &gt;&gt; And maybe we're hide hiding behind a fig
[1:35:26] leaf of the message.
[1:35:28] &gt;&gt; Oh, brother Matthew, that's blasph. No,
[1:35:31] &gt;&gt; no. You you can take the message of the
[1:35:33] hour. And it could just be a fig leaf
[1:35:36] religion.
[1:35:36] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:35:37] &gt;&gt; Just do enough to get by that nobody
[1:35:39] knows.
[1:35:39] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:35:41] &gt;&gt; It reminds me of Isaiah 4. You know, uh
[1:35:43] they they they said, "Oh, you know, let
[1:35:44] us eat our own bread. Let us wear our
[1:35:46] own apparel." Only let us be called by
[1:35:47] thy name to take away our reproach. Some
[1:35:50] people just want to claim the message to
[1:35:51] take away their reproach.
[1:35:53] &gt;&gt; I want to live it with all my heart.
[1:35:56] &gt;&gt; Lord, if I if I got to separate from
[1:35:57] friends, if I got to separate from
[1:35:59] family, if I got TO GO HERE, LORD, I
[1:36:01] JUST WANT TO BE PLEASING to you, Lord.
[1:36:03] If there's something in MY LIFE THAT I'M
[1:36:05] DOING THAT, LORD, I WANT TO TAKE IT AWAY
[1:36:07] from me. Lord, deal with my heart. LORD,
[1:36:08] BRING CONVICTION. LORD, I I WANT TO GIVE
[1:36:10] IT UP. I I DON'T WANT TO BE PULLED HERE
[1:36:12] and there and let the things of the
[1:36:14] WORLD ALWAYS DOMINATE MY TIME. AND MAYBE
[1:36:16] YOU'RE ADDICTED TO YOUR PHONE AND you
[1:36:18] just can't get the victory over it. I
[1:36:20] SAY, "WHY DON'T YOU JUST GIVE IT UP?"
[1:36:21] SAY, "LORD, forgive me for that. I WANT
[1:36:23] TO FIND MYSELF IN PRAYER MORE. I WANT TO
[1:36:25] BECOME A LOVER OF YOUR WORD and a lover
[1:36:27] of the message of the hour. Lord, I WANT
[1:36:29] TO BE IN PRAYER FOR THE MINISTRY AND FOR
[1:36:30] MY PASTOR. I I WANT TO APPLY THE THE THE
[1:36:32] THE token at my home. I want there to be
[1:36:35] such AN ATMOSPHERE, LORD, THAT IN MY
[1:36:36] HOUSE AND IN MY CAR THAT WHEN I COME TO
[1:36:38] CHURCH, I CAN BE PART OF THE DIFFERENCE.
[1:36:42] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH.
[1:36:44] &gt;&gt; Then I'll tell YOU WHAT, WE START
[1:36:46] GETTING IN ONE MIND AND one accord
[1:36:49] &gt;&gt; because you know an attitude, a wrong
[1:36:51] attitude can hinder the move of the
[1:36:53] spirit.
[1:36:55] &gt;&gt; Right? Brother B said, "I long for the
[1:36:57] days OF ANANAS AND SAFIRE WHEN SIN WOULD
[1:37:00] BE CALLED OUT AT THE DOOR." I I BELIEVE
[1:37:02] WE'RE RIGHT THERE.
[1:37:04] &gt;&gt; The word is still a discerner of the
[1:37:05] thoughts AND INTENTS OF THE HEART WILL
[1:37:07] CALL YOU OUT WITH WHERE YOU'RE LIVING.
[1:37:08] AND YOU WONDER WHY THE SPIRIT AIN'T
[1:37:10] MOVING. YOU WONDER WHY THE PREACHER'S
[1:37:12] HAVING A HARD TIME. YOU WONDER WHY THE
[1:37:13] SONG LEADER'S HAVING A HARD TIME. I
[1:37:15] WONDER IF WE'RE NOT THE PROBLEM. AND
[1:37:17] SOME OF US, WE JUST NEED TO SAY, "LORD,
[1:37:18] FORGIVE ME. I NEED TO GET IN GEAR. IT'S
[1:37:21] TIME TO GO IN A RAPTURE."
[1:37:23] &gt;&gt; LOOK, WE'RE NOT GUARANTEED TOMORROW.
[1:37:26] BUT WHAT WE DO HAVE IS RIGHT NOW.
[1:37:29] &gt;&gt; WE WE'VE JUST STEPPED INTO 2026. WE
[1:37:31] MIGHT NOT MAKE IT ALL THE WAY. WE MIGHT
[1:37:33] NOT MAKE IT TILL [screaming] MONDAY. I I
[1:37:35] HEARD UH PRAISE GOD THERE WAS A YOUNG
[1:37:37] BOY WHO WAS JUST IN AN ACCIDENT. PRAISE
[1:37:39] GOD. AND GOD SPARED HIS LIFE. THAT'S THE
[1:37:41] GRACE OF GOD. I WANT TO TELL YOU WHAT,
[1:37:43] IT COULD HAVE BEEN ALL SHE WROTE RIGHT
[1:37:45] THERE.
[1:37:46] &gt;&gt; And it could be any of you.
[1:37:49] &gt;&gt; But I want to TELL YOU THIS. PRAISE GOD.
[1:37:51] WE HAVE A REST.
[1:37:52] &gt;&gt; WE HAVE AN ASSURANCE. IT DON'T MATTER
[1:37:54] WHAT COMES OR WHAT GOES. WHETHER WHETHER
[1:37:56] WHETHER OUR TIME ON THIS STRAND IS JUST
[1:37:59] A FEW YEARS OR IT'S A LONG YEARS. That's
[1:38:01] not where I come from.
[1:38:04] &gt;&gt; I came from God and I'm going back to
[1:38:06] God.
[1:38:08] &gt;&gt; What's important is that you shine your
[1:38:10] light
[1:38:11] &gt;&gt; in your allotted time.
[1:38:14] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:38:15] &gt;&gt; And if your light ain't shining, I say
[1:38:17] let's get sincere this morning. Amen.
[1:38:19] &gt;&gt; Let's say, Lord, you said that ye are
[1:38:21] the light of the world, and it's the
[1:38:23] very light in me that's shining out that
[1:38:26] brings life. Everybody feeling okay?
[1:38:29] &gt;&gt; All right. Maybe we'll start preaching
[1:38:30] here pretty quick.
[1:38:33] &gt;&gt; I want to I I I want to be a doer of the
[1:38:35] word, not just a hearer only.
[1:38:39] &gt;&gt; You You might be able to fool men, but
[1:38:40] you're not going to fool God.
[1:38:43] &gt;&gt; That's what Jesus would say in Matthew
[1:38:44] 15:18. He said, "People draw nigh unto
[1:38:46] me with their mouth and honor me with
[1:38:47] their lips, but their heart is far from
[1:38:50] me." What is it? It's a heart problem.
[1:38:54] And if you start to catch a revelation,
[1:38:57] that's why God had to send a prophet.
[1:39:00] &gt;&gt; Scripture says the heart is is deceitful
[1:39:03] above all things.
[1:39:05] And and if it wasn't for this word to
[1:39:08] come and start to deal with your heart
[1:39:10] and to show you the air of religion and
[1:39:13] and intellectual faith and all these
[1:39:15] things, we would BE CAUGHT THAT WE'D BE
[1:39:16] HONORING GOD WITH OUR LIPS, BUT BUT WE
[1:39:18] WOULD HAVE A HEART THAT HADN'T BEEN
[1:39:20] TURNED.
[1:39:21] &gt;&gt; But it's the very light of God's word
[1:39:23] that's turning the heart that's changing
[1:39:24] you. That there we're not like THOSE WHO
[1:39:27] ARE JUST honoring the Lord with their
[1:39:29] lips, quoting the quotes. We got a lot
[1:39:31] of people doing it, right?
[1:39:32] &gt;&gt; They quote the quote. They quote the
[1:39:34] message. THEY GO TO CHURCH. BUT WHERE'S
[1:39:35] the life? Where's the good works?
[1:39:37] Where's the fruit OF THE SPIRIT? WHERE'S
[1:39:39] THE LIGHT?
[1:39:40] &gt;&gt; HE SAID, "BY THIS YOU'LL KNOW THAT THEY
[1:39:41] ARE MY DISCIPLES by your love one for
[1:39:44] another."
[1:39:46] &gt;&gt; NOT BY OUR BACKBITING, OUR GOSSIPING our
[1:39:48] traditions,
[1:39:50] &gt;&gt; but if we have love one for another.
[1:39:53] &gt;&gt; What did Paul say? You You can have
[1:39:54] everything else, but if you don't have
[1:39:57] love, we'll just try to start moving
[1:39:59] towards a close. Jesus said, 'You know
[1:40:01] them by their fruits.
[1:40:04] &gt;&gt; He said this, and why are people so
[1:40:06] tossed about? A wonderful message for
[1:40:08] the new year. He preached this in 56
[1:40:11] January 1st. He said, "Many people go to
[1:40:12] service and rejoice and shout and praise
[1:40:15] the Lord while the spirit of God is
[1:40:17] falling. All condemnation left their
[1:40:20] heart, and as soon as a day or two after
[1:40:24] the revival, they find themselves back
[1:40:26] in that old grind again. Yet they were
[1:40:29] eating mana.
[1:40:34] &gt;&gt; Is Is that Is that what it is?
[1:40:36] &gt;&gt; It's just camp to camp, service to
[1:40:38] service. We rejoice. We praise God. But
[1:40:40] then the home life's no different. I
[1:40:43] know we might be hitting this over and
[1:40:44] over and over, but friends, I I needed a
[1:40:47] simple gospel.
[1:40:49] &gt;&gt; This isn't some puffed up stuffed shirt
[1:40:51] religion where we walk around like we
[1:40:53] know something, but it's something to
[1:40:55] get down home where you're living.
[1:40:58] right
[1:40:58] &gt;&gt; into the trenches of your life,
[1:41:02] &gt;&gt; into your kitchen,
[1:41:04] &gt;&gt; INTO YOUR BEDROOM, INTO YOUR CAR,
[1:41:06] &gt;&gt; into your workspace, and start TO DEAL
[1:41:08] WITH YOUR heart and with where you're
[1:41:11] living that when you GO BACK, IT'S JUST
[1:41:13] NOT THE SAME. I I'm I I I friends, I'm
[1:41:18] realizing more and more and more, the
[1:41:19] prophet said it's it's it's it's very
[1:41:21] few.
[1:41:22] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[1:41:23] &gt;&gt; It's very few. And I say it behooves us
[1:41:26] each individual
[1:41:28] to work out your salvation with fear and
[1:41:30] trembling
[1:41:32] &gt;&gt; that you haven't accepted some some some
[1:41:34] intellectual faith and start examining
[1:41:38] your life. But brother Brandham says in
[1:41:40] one place we'll just look what Jesus did
[1:41:42] and look what you do and then compare
[1:41:43] yourself.
[1:41:44] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:41:46] &gt;&gt; Sometimes a prophet could tighten IT
[1:41:47] DOWN SO TIGHT YOU'RE LIKE MAN I AIN'T
[1:41:48] got a hope. But I say this if you're a
[1:41:50] predestinated SEED OF GOD IT'LL produce
[1:41:52] a hunger and a thirst in your heart.
[1:41:53] Say, Lord, I believe it.
[1:41:55] &gt;&gt; Lord, you said those that hunger and
[1:41:56] thirst after righteousness, they shall
[1:41:58] be filled because it has to be more than
[1:42:01] routine. It has to be more than just
[1:42:03] going to church. It has TO BE MORE THAN
[1:42:05] UH UH THAN JUST YOUR GOOD WORKS. IT HAS
[1:42:06] TO BE A HIDDEN LIFE. SO, just moving on,
[1:42:09] Brother Brandham says in shalom, the
[1:42:11] world is one of the most chaotic times
[1:42:13] of darkness that it's ever stood in. And
[1:42:15] yet, it's standing again in the most
[1:42:16] blessed light that ever did shine. The
[1:42:20] difference is just like it was in the
[1:42:21] beginning when there was gross darkness
[1:42:24] upon the earth and the spirit of God
[1:42:26] moved upon the face of the water and
[1:42:28] said, "Let there be light."
[1:42:32] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:42:32] &gt;&gt; Oh, praise God. We have a word that's
[1:42:35] moving upon your life and saying, "Let
[1:42:37] there be light." And God separated the
[1:42:40] light from the darkness. And I believe
[1:42:42] that we are now living in that hour
[1:42:44] again that when God is separating light
[1:42:47] from darkness and he's pressing it to
[1:42:49] the other side of the world that light
[1:42:51] might be made manifest.
[1:42:56] &gt;&gt; Are you willing to have an open heart
[1:42:58] this morning?
[1:42:59] &gt;&gt; Just let the spirit of God start to move
[1:43:01] upon your heart and upon your life. And
[1:43:05] this word starts to what? Separate the
[1:43:07] darkness from the light. You start to
[1:43:09] look in and say, ' Lord, maybe I ain't
[1:43:10] been living quite right. Maybe I I I
[1:43:13] haven't been doing the things that I
[1:43:14] should be doing. John, 1 John 1:7 says,
[1:43:17] "But if you walk in the light as he IS
[1:43:18] IN THE LIGHT, WE HAVE FELLOWSHIP one
[1:43:20] with another. And the blood of Jesus
[1:43:21] Christ, his son, cleanses us from all
[1:43:24] sin."
[1:43:25] &gt;&gt; I just want to end right along these
[1:43:28] lines here. Just be a few more moments.
[1:43:31] In our text in John 8:12,
[1:43:34] Jesus said, "I am the light of the
[1:43:36] world. He that followeth me shall not
[1:43:37] walk in darkness.
[1:43:39] &gt;&gt; You You look at this woman here in her
[1:43:43] condition and this this hopeless case,
[1:43:47] she's doomed to die. But but I I love
[1:43:50] what what what took place here because
[1:43:53] here now the law
[1:43:56] is taking a sinner and presenting them
[1:43:59] before the word.
[1:44:01] &gt;&gt; Right?
[1:44:02] &gt;&gt; But see that that word, WHAT WAS IT? HE
[1:44:04] WAS THE light
[1:44:06] &gt;&gt; and he HE SHINED INTO THAT situation
[1:44:10] and all the accusers went away AND HE
[1:44:12] SAID, "LOOK, NEITHER DO I CONDEMN THEE.
[1:44:14] GO AND SIN NO MORE." YOU YOU HAVE TO
[1:44:17] RECOGNIZE THAT THIS WORD THAT GOD HAS
[1:44:20] SENT IS THE VERY LIGHT OF GOD WANTING to
[1:44:22] shine into your life.
[1:44:25] &gt;&gt; Not to condemn you.
[1:44:27] &gt;&gt; Not to give us a bunch of rules AND
[1:44:29] REGULATIONS AND YOU GOT TO DO THIS AND
[1:44:31] YOU GOT TO DO THAT, BUT IT'S A LIBERTY
[1:44:32] TO SET YOU FREE.
[1:44:34] AND IF YOU'LL JUST ALLOW THE WORD OF GOD
[1:44:36] TO START TO SHINE INTO YOUR LIFE, it'll
[1:44:39] bring you OUT OF THE DARKNESS. IT'LL
[1:44:41] BRING YOU OUT OF THE CONFUSION. IT'LL
[1:44:43] ANSWER YOUR QUESTIONS. IT'LL FIX YOUR
[1:44:45] MARRIAGE. IT'LL HEAL YOUR BODY. IT'LL
[1:44:47] BRING SALVATION. IT'LL BRING
[1:44:48] DELIVERANCE.
[1:44:49] &gt;&gt; It'll start TO SHINE INTO YOUR SITUATION
[1:44:52] AND BRING THE RESULTS OR THE REALITY OF
[1:44:55] THE WORD.
[1:44:56] &gt;&gt; I MEAN, LOOK at this this girl. SHE YOU
[1:44:59] CAN'T GET IT ANY WORSE.
[1:45:02] THEY'RE READY TO TAKE UP ROCKS AND STONE
[1:45:04] HER.
[1:45:06] &gt;&gt; And maybe maybe where you're at right
[1:45:08] now, I DON'T KNOW, MAYBE YOU WE'VE COME
[1:45:10] INTO THE NEW year and and WHERE YOU'RE
[1:45:12] YOU'RE AT, YOU'RE LIKE, MAN, THIS I I
[1:45:14] WAS LOOKING FORWARD to a new year and I
[1:45:15] WAS LOOKING FOR A CHANGE AND THINGS ARE
[1:45:17] SUPPOSED TO BE DIFFERENT. IT DIDN'T TAKE
[1:45:18] JANUARY ONE, BUT A TRIAL RIGHT OFF THE
[1:45:21] BAT.
[1:45:24] NOTHING'S EVER GOING TO CHANGE.
[1:45:25] NOTHING'S EVER GOING TO BE DIFFERENT. I
[1:45:26] TRIED. I CALLED ON the Lord.
[1:45:29] and you JUST YOU JUST SEE, OH MY
[1:45:31] GOODNESS, HERE IT IS ONCE AGAIN.
[1:45:36] But I want to say that the word of God
[1:45:37] is here right now.
[1:45:40] &gt;&gt; Why don't you just go ahead and
[1:45:41] surrender
[1:45:43] &gt;&gt; your problem,
[1:45:44] &gt;&gt; surrender your life,
[1:45:46] &gt;&gt; your marriage,
[1:45:47] &gt;&gt; your bondage, WHATEVER IT IS. LOOK, YOU
[1:45:49] MIGHT BE STRUGGLING to to to to to to
[1:45:53] believe and and to live the message. You
[1:45:55] might be struggling with clipping your
[1:45:56] hair, burning, clipping it. I don't care
[1:45:57] what you do. break it, make it shorter,
[1:45:59] whatever you do TO MAKE IT SHORT. YOU
[1:46:00] MIGHT BE STRUGG WITH THOSE THINGS. LOOK,
[1:46:02] IF IT'S JUST LAWS AND REGULATIONS, WHAT
[1:46:04] I'M INVITING YOU TO IS IS A SURRENDER to
[1:46:06] the message, to the word OF THE HOUR TO
[1:46:08] SHINE INTO YOUR HEART. AND I WANT TO ASK
[1:46:10] YOU, DO YOU REALLY want to love Jesus?
[1:46:12] Do you really WANT TO SERVE GOD WITH ALL
[1:46:14] YOUR HEART? THEN GOD HAS SENT A WORD TO
[1:46:16] SHINE INTO YOUR HEART TO MAKE THAT A
[1:46:19] REALITY. NOT SOMETHING YOU'RE JUST
[1:46:20] TRYING TO MUSTER UP AND SOMETHING YOU'RE
[1:46:22] TRYING TO DO AND I'M good for one week
[1:46:24] and THEN THE NEXT WEEK I FALL APART.
[1:46:27] BACK TO THEIR REGULAR GRIND. I'm just
[1:46:30] going to invite the musicians to come.
[1:46:31] We'll find a place to settle down.
[1:46:34] &gt;&gt; But we wanna
[1:46:36] we want to be delivered.
[1:46:39] &gt;&gt; We want to be set free. We want to come
[1:46:40] to the place where now this word isn't
[1:46:43] tabernacling in my life
[1:46:46] &gt;&gt; and I'm no longer on the defensive,
[1:46:48] &gt;&gt; but I can go to my brothers and sisters
[1:46:50] and now I can be light that brings life
[1:46:52] in their life.
[1:46:53] &gt;&gt; That's what I'm trying to to bring this
[1:46:55] morning. Brother Brandham said, "I've
[1:46:56] come to the spot, I believe, that people
[1:46:58] don't know what they're doing. IT COMES
[1:46:59] TO A TIME WHERE THE HUMAN being has
[1:47:01] looks like becomes such a subject of
[1:47:02] evil until it's a pathetic thing. IT
[1:47:04] SEEMS LIKE A SHADOW OF DARKNESS JUST
[1:47:06] OVER the people and it presses them.
[1:47:07] What is it doing? Look at the people.
[1:47:09] They they're pressing pressed to empty
[1:47:10] substitutes and a and drugs and alcohol.
[1:47:13] PEOPLE ARE LOSING THEIR MIND, TAKING THE
[1:47:15] LIFE UH UH SUICIDES ON A ON A RAMPAGE.
[1:47:17] WHY ARE THEY DOING ALL THESE THINGS?
[1:47:19] BECAUSE WHAT? THEY DON'T HAVE WHAT WE
[1:47:21] [screaming] HAVE." AMEN.
[1:47:24] &gt;&gt; AND I SAY, COULD I BE THE ONE? COULD I
[1:47:26] BE THE DIFFERENCE IN SOMEBODY'S life
[1:47:29] that I can go, Lord, AND I CAN TAKE THIS
[1:47:31] MESSAGE of the hour, not just a book,
[1:47:34] not just a quote, BUT THE WORD IN ME,
[1:47:37] &gt;&gt; a living reality, and I can go to
[1:47:39] SOMEBODY AND I CAN start to share with
[1:47:40] them the message of the hour. Not from
[1:47:43] some intellectual standpoint that God
[1:47:46] sent a prophet,
[1:47:48] but that the word has become alive in
[1:47:51] me.
[1:47:53] And you can look into some situation and
[1:47:55] say, "You know what? I know what it's
[1:47:57] like. Let me tell you what God did for
[1:48:00] me. I went through this trial and I lost
[1:48:03] a loved one and I I went through this
[1:48:07] and and as as tragic, I said, "But you
[1:48:09] know what? He was always there."
[1:48:11] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:48:12] And God knows how to to take your life.
[1:48:15] And
[1:48:17] he says in Romans 8, he says, "All
[1:48:19] things work together for good to them
[1:48:21] who are called according to the Lord."
[1:48:25] And you REALIZE THAT GOD CAN TAKE A LIFE
[1:48:27] AND YOU CAN START SHINING into other
[1:48:29] people's lives [music] and to other
[1:48:30] situations. And you start to look upon
[1:48:32] the need at your workplace or or at the
[1:48:35] store or or in your home or in the
[1:48:37] church. Maybe you see somebody, they
[1:48:38] don't get a lot of fellowship. YOU SAY,
[1:48:39] "YOU KNOW WHAT? I WANT TO INVITE THEM
[1:48:41] OVER.
[1:48:42] I I want to be light to them.
[1:48:47] He says it's come to a a place where it
[1:48:49] just seems like a shadow of darkness
[1:48:51] just over the people.
[1:48:54] But Colossians 3:4 says, "When Christ
[1:48:56] who is our life shall appear, then shall
[1:48:58] ye also appear with him in glory."
[1:49:01] &gt;&gt; Where is he appearing?
[1:49:03] Just like that woman in John 8.
[1:49:07] &gt;&gt; Could you imagine?
[1:49:09] Oh, I'm dead. I've done it for the last
[1:49:10] time. This is it.
[1:49:13] But all of a sudden, who was she
[1:49:15] standing before?
[1:49:17] Christ, the word.
[1:49:19] &gt;&gt; And he's saying, "I don't condemn you.
[1:49:22] Not only do I not condemn you, you're
[1:49:24] forgiven.
[1:49:26] &gt;&gt; Not only you're forgiven, you're
[1:49:28] justified.
[1:49:30] &gt;&gt; You never did it in the first place.
[1:49:33] &gt;&gt; YOU ARE STANDING PERFECT."
[1:49:36] That's what the message come to do. It
[1:49:38] come to set you free from your past.
[1:49:41] &gt;&gt; Come to set you free from all your hurt
[1:49:44] &gt;&gt; and all your bondage
[1:49:47] &gt;&gt; that you can walk in newness of life.
[1:49:48] Let's all just stand.
[1:49:55] Brother Bandham says,
[1:50:00] "Then when God was made flesh and became
[1:50:02] the Messiah,
[1:50:04] then if we can yield ourselves to be the
[1:50:06] anointed like he was, we become Messiah.
[1:50:11] Little lights. That's what the church is
[1:50:14] supposed to be. Lights, little anointed
[1:50:16] ones.
[1:50:18] That's God's church." Let's just pray.
[1:50:21] Lord Jesus.
[1:50:24] Lord, we just come to this portion in
[1:50:26] the service, Lord. Maybe just a more a
[1:50:30] little bit more sobriety, Lord, just to
[1:50:32] check up in our lives as we're coming
[1:50:34] into a new year.
[1:50:37] Lord, we
[1:50:40] we want to be that light to shine into
[1:50:42] the darkness. Lord,
[1:50:44] you said we are the light of the world.
[1:50:48] Lord, uh we want to be a city that's set
[1:50:51] on a hill, Lord, that others might see
[1:50:53] our good works and glorify our father
[1:50:55] which is in heaven.
[1:50:58] Lord, you know the hearts of your people
[1:51:00] and what they're going through and their
[1:51:01] situations.
[1:51:03] Lord, you maybe know the the struggle in
[1:51:05] their marriage or Father, maybe they're
[1:51:08] struggling with sanctification.
[1:51:12] But Lord, I know that you're present
[1:51:13] here right now, Lord. That if we could
[1:51:16] just surrender to you and ask, Lord,
[1:51:18] that you forgive us of our sins, Lord,
[1:51:20] that we can just repent.
[1:51:23] Lord, you're right here to fill us with
[1:51:24] the baptism of the Holy Ghost and to
[1:51:27] take away the shame and the guilt. Lord,
[1:51:29] your word says there's therefore now no
[1:51:31] condemnation to them that are in Christ
[1:51:33] Jesus. You said, "Blessed is the man
[1:51:35] whom the Lord will not impute sin."
[1:51:38] Lord, what a message we've received,
[1:51:41] Lord, for your word shines into the
[1:51:43] darkness, Lord. It starts to separate
[1:51:44] the darkness out of our life, Lord. And
[1:51:47] it gives us the hope. It gives us the
[1:51:49] faith to know, Lord, that just as the
[1:51:52] Holy Spirit overshadowed Mary.
[1:51:55] You'll overshadow our lives, Lord. And
[1:51:58] you'll bring forth this word into
[1:52:00] manifestation,
[1:52:01] Lord. Not by our ability,
[1:52:04] not by something we can do, Lord, but
[1:52:06] it's because the light of your word that
[1:52:08] shines upon that seed inside of us, it's
[1:52:11] growing, Lord, into that fulfillment of
[1:52:13] what you've spoken.
[1:52:15] And now, Lord, we want to be that light
[1:52:17] to others. So, we just surrender
[1:52:18] ourselves to you, Lord, as we would just
[1:52:21] sing a song of worship. We commit the
[1:52:22] people to you now. In the name of the
[1:52:24] Lord Jesus Christ, we pray.
[1:52:26] Amen. Let's just sing this song.
[1:52:35] What is what?
[1:52:38] Help me sing it.
[1:52:42] &gt;&gt; To be all
[1:52:46] is
[1:52:47] [music]
[1:52:48] [singing]

[1:53:00] &gt;&gt; He's in [singing] the house.
[1:53:05] &gt;&gt; A little girl [singing] was lying there.
[1:53:09] People all were weeping. [music]
[1:53:13] They just laughed at [singing] Jesus
[1:53:15] when he said she's only sleeping.
[1:53:20] As he took [singing and music] her by
[1:53:22] the head,
[1:53:24] she began to live again. [music]
[1:53:28] Some begin to praise the [singing] Lord.
[1:53:31] Some begin to say, [music]
[1:53:35] "He's in [singing] the house.
[1:53:39] Death has to flee.
[1:53:42] Now [singing and music] there is light
[1:53:46] where darkness used to be.
[1:53:49] [music] Now there is hope.
[1:53:53] There's no [singing] more time.
[1:53:56] So [music] I praise his name.
[1:54:01] Praise [singing] his name.
[1:54:04] He's in the [music] house.
[1:54:10] We are like that [singing and music]
[1:54:12] little girl beding all our sins. How
[1:54:16] many can raise your [music] hand and say
[1:54:17] that's the truth. search his [singing]
[1:54:19] heart of mine
[1:54:20] &gt;&gt; and then he gave me life again
[1:54:25] [music] cuz I am just a house of clay
[1:54:29] but ever since that [music and singing]
[1:54:30] blessed day
[1:54:32] there's a light that shines in me
[1:54:35] [music] for all the world to see
[1:54:40] he's [singing] in the house
[1:54:47] now [singing] there is light
[1:54:50] [music] where darkness used to be.
[1:54:54] Now [singing] there is hope. [music]
[1:54:58] There's no more doubt. [singing]
[1:55:01] [music] So I'll praise his name.
[1:55:05] Praise [singing] his name. [music] He's
[1:55:09] in the house.
[1:55:14] We are like that little girl dead
[1:55:18] [music and singing] in all our sins.
[1:55:22] Jesus touched his heart of mine, gave
[1:55:25] [singing and music] me life again.
[1:55:29] I am just the house of clay. [music] Let
[1:55:32] me testify this morning.
[1:55:35] &gt;&gt; There's a [singing] light that's been
[1:55:37] [music] shining in me for all the world
[1:55:40] [singing] to see.
[1:55:43] He's [music] in the house.
[1:55:48] [singing]
[1:55:50] And now there [music] is light
[1:55:53] where darkness used to be.
[1:55:57] Now there [music] is hope.
[1:56:01] There's no more doubt.
[1:56:04] So I'll [singing] praise his [music]
[1:56:06] name.
[1:56:08] Praise his [singing]
[1:56:09] name.
[1:56:12] He's in the house [music]
[1:56:15] and death has to flee.
[1:56:19] And now there is [singing and music]
[1:56:20] life
[1:56:22] where darkness used to be.
[1:56:26] And now there is [singing and music]
[1:56:27] hope.
[1:56:30] There's no more.
[1:56:32] [music and singing] So I'll praise his
[1:56:35] name.
[1:56:37] Praise his name. [music]
[1:56:40] He's in [singing] the house.
[1:56:48] &gt;&gt; Amen. How many can say now there's light
[1:56:50] [music] where darkness used to be. Amen.
[1:56:53] I don't know about y'all, but I enjoyed
[1:56:55] that. Amen. The Lord speaking to our
[1:56:59] [applause] heart this morning.
[1:57:01] [music] Amen.
[1:57:05] You know, I wonder how many here being
[1:57:08] the first
[1:57:09] service of a new year.
[1:57:14] Jesus said there was a woman that had 10
[1:57:16] coins.
[1:57:18] &gt;&gt; And after noticing that one was lost,
[1:57:21] the Bible says she lit a candle and
[1:57:24] swept the house [music] and sought
[1:57:27] diligently to find it.
[1:57:30] You know, I I think about that woman.
[1:57:34] You ever wonder how she knew that a coin
[1:57:36] was lost?
[1:57:40] because she was looking.
[1:57:42] &gt;&gt; She checked
[1:57:44] &gt;&gt; to see if one was [music] missing
[1:57:47] &gt;&gt; here. Brother Matt come and preach the
[1:57:49] opening service
[1:57:51] of this year. And I think what a time
[1:57:55] that here we could reflect on our life
[1:57:57] and [music] say, "Lord, is there
[1:57:58] something missing?" I wonder how many
[1:58:00] can be honest this morning. Maybe just
[1:58:03] just uh have your hand raised. Lord I
[1:58:05] let me search my heart and [music]
[1:58:08] search my life and Lord if there be
[1:58:10] something missing here that brother was
[1:58:12] speaking and don't just put it off as I
[1:58:15] you you know the Lord was speaking to
[1:58:17] you I while your hands are raised and I
[1:58:20] don't say this to put on any man but
[1:58:22] there's direct word for [music] word
[1:58:24] conversations that I've had that that
[1:58:26] brother spoke out of his mouth this
[1:58:28] morning and we don't even [music] talk
[1:58:30] about the church and we he's been with
[1:58:32] us for a few days we never we never
[1:58:34] talked about the church one time or the
[1:58:36] condition [music] and we were just
[1:58:37] fellowshipping and having time with the
[1:58:39] family but direct word for word. You
[1:58:41] say, "Well, why would he say that?"
[1:58:43] Because it wasn't the man saying it.
[1:58:46] &gt;&gt; See, what was it? It was that candle
[1:58:48] that the woman used to search her house
[1:58:50] for what was missing. That was the light
[1:58:52] that was shining out this morning. That
[1:58:55] searching our hearts to find out what's
[1:58:57] missing in it.
[1:58:58] &gt;&gt; To look right into our life and find out
[1:59:00] what's missing. And if we could be
[1:59:01] honest with oursel, maybe you could just
[1:59:03] bow your head just a moment [music] and
[1:59:05] take this as a moment and say, "Lord, I
[1:59:07] don't want nothing to be missing in my
[1:59:09] life. I I don't want there to be a coin
[1:59:11] gone. I there may there just be any
[1:59:13] place." Just be just be real earnest
[1:59:16] here. We're starting a new year. God
[1:59:19] bless [music] you this morning. Real
[1:59:21] saints of God. That's what a real son of
[1:59:23] God does. He searches his life. A real
[1:59:26] daughter of God, she searches her life
[1:59:28] and searches her heart. Lord, may you
[1:59:30] shine the light of the word upon my life
[1:59:32] [music] and find if there's any missing
[1:59:34] place. Lord, I I pray that you would
[1:59:36] shine it. Lord, make it so open to me
[1:59:40] and then take that candle that our
[1:59:42] brother spoke about tonight.
[1:59:44] Take that very candle of the word of God
[1:59:46] and let it correct it. Sweep the house.
[1:59:50] Check the house. Lord, may you [music]
[1:59:53] correct me, Lord. Let me just lay it
[1:59:56] upon this altar, Lord, this morning.
[1:59:58] Lord, let me start a new year. Don't let
[2:00:00] me don't let me start it like I ended
[2:00:02] the last one. Friends, you know, you can
[2:00:04] be honest with yourself. [music]
[2:00:06] We don't want to put nobody on the spot,
[2:00:08] but you can be honest with yourself. You
[2:00:10] know what's missing in your life here?
[2:00:12] God done spent an hour showing you why
[2:00:15] you was sitting thinking about it. Or
[2:00:17] brother, wouldn't maybe it wasn't even
[2:00:18] something that he said, but it made you
[2:00:19] think of it and [music] you went to
[2:00:21] reflecting on your own. You know what's
[2:00:22] missing in your life? Say, Lord, I I
[2:00:24] pray that you would help me this
[2:00:25] morning. God bless you, brother, for
[2:00:27] being honest with God. [music] Lord, I
[2:00:29] pray that you would help me, Lord. Help
[2:00:30] me to overcome this that I've been
[2:00:32] battling. Help me overcome this
[2:00:34] temptation. Help me to overcome this
[2:00:36] trial.
[2:00:38] God is a just God.
[2:00:39] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[2:00:40] &gt;&gt; And he's brought you to a place in a
[2:00:42] moment that he can help you move past
[2:00:44] that very thing. Can you just lay it
[2:00:46] down upon an altar this morning? Lord, I
[2:00:49] I want a testimony. [music]
[2:00:51] I want a real testimony. I don't want to
[2:00:53] live like the world and look like the
[2:00:54] world and act like the world and and
[2:00:56] dress like the world just to make the
[2:00:57] world accept me. But I accepted Jesus
[2:01:00] Christ and he's who I'm looking for
[2:01:03] to accept me. Let me just lay down last
[2:01:06] year. Let me pick up a new year and
[2:01:11] let's just bow our heads. Won't we just
[2:01:13] pray each one? Gracious heavenly father,
[2:01:15] [music]
[2:01:16] Lord, you see these hands that are
[2:01:19] raised, Lord.
[2:01:21] Lord, honest hearts,
[2:01:24] God, knowing the places in our life,
[2:01:26] Lord, that that is missing. And Lord,
[2:01:30] any real honestarted believer, Lord,
[2:01:33] God, that's his desire is to be right
[2:01:36] with you, Lord, that
[2:01:40] Lord, that we could live a life that is
[2:01:41] worthy of the gospel.
[2:01:44] Lord, we just ask you this morning,
[2:01:46] Lord, as you move about this place. And
[2:01:49] Lord, as you would convict each one,
[2:01:51] God, we we never we never run from
[2:01:54] conviction. Lord, we thank you for it.
[2:01:57] God, it's the very thing that shows us
[2:01:59] where we're wrong. And Lord, the things
[2:02:01] that need to be made right in our life,
[2:02:03] Lord, we thank you for it, Lord. And I
[2:02:05] pray that you'd convict every heart,
[2:02:07] Lord. God, that there'd be something in
[2:02:09] our in our life, Lord, that would cause
[2:02:11] us to want to live closer to you, Lord.
[2:02:14] God, as we start this new year off,
[2:02:16] Lord, that maybe we would take inventory
[2:02:18] of our own lives, Lord, I pray that you
[2:02:21] would help us this morning to find those
[2:02:22] missing places. And God, that we would
[2:02:25] fill them with the Holy Spirit, Lord,
[2:02:27] that there wouldn't be one place in our
[2:02:28] life that the devil would have room to
[2:02:30] take over, Lord, or or to cause problems
[2:02:34] in our lives, Lord. We just thank you
[2:02:36] for it now this morning, Lord. I pray
[2:02:38] that you would help each one, God. May
[2:02:40] we draw closer to you, Lord. God, may
[2:02:43] this year be a a year that we could do
[2:02:46] what our brother was preaching. Lord,
[2:02:48] that we could we could share the light
[2:02:50] of this gospel. Lord, may we manifest
[2:02:52] the light of Jesus Christ, God, may we
[2:02:54] live it and be a testimony of it. And
[2:02:58] then one day soon, Lord, that each one
[2:03:00] of these believers, these saints, Lord,
[2:03:02] that sit in this building this morning,
[2:03:04] God, that one day together we'll take a
[2:03:06] body change, Lord. and all those that
[2:03:09] would sit back and laugh and make fun,
[2:03:11] Lord. We'll still cry for mercy, God,
[2:03:13] that you would have mercy upon them,
[2:03:16] Lord, that they would have an
[2:03:17] opportunity for eternal life. But Lord,
[2:03:21] we don't want to live through some
[2:03:23] tribulation and go through something
[2:03:25] like that. Lord, we just cry, Lord, that
[2:03:28] in this time when that you've given us,
[2:03:30] Lord, this time of mercy, Lord, that we
[2:03:32] would accept it. Lord, I pray that you
[2:03:35] would help each one. Lord, we thank you
[2:03:37] for it now. [music] In Jesus name we
[2:03:40] pray.
[2:03:43] Yes, my Lord. [singing]
[2:03:48] I give myself away [music and singing]
[2:03:52] so you
[2:03:54] can use me. I give myself
[2:03:57] [music and singing]
[2:03:58] away.

[2:04:09] can use me. Take my life,
[2:04:16] take my heart [singing]
[2:04:20] as a living [music]
[2:04:23] sacrifice. [singing]
[2:04:27] All my dreams, [music]
[2:04:31] all my [singing]
[2:04:32] plans,
[2:04:35] Lord, I place [music and singing]
[2:04:38] them in your hands.
[2:04:42] I give [music and singing] myself away.
[2:04:48] [music]
[2:04:49] I give myself [singing]
[2:04:51] away
[2:04:53] so you
[2:04:55] can use [music] me. I give [singing]
[2:04:58] myself away.
[2:05:03] [music]
[2:05:04] I give myself [singing]
[2:05:06] away
[2:05:08] so you
[2:05:10] [music] can use me. Here [singing]
[2:05:13] I am. [music]
[2:05:16] Here I stand.
[2:05:20] Lord, my life
[2:05:23] is in your [music] hands.
[2:05:27] Lord, [singing]
[2:05:28] I'm longing
[2:05:31] [music]
[2:05:32] to see
[2:05:34] [singing]
[2:05:35] your desires [music]
[2:05:38] revealed
[2:05:40] in me. [singing]
[2:05:42] I give myself away.
[2:05:47] [music]
[2:05:49] I give [singing] myself away
[2:05:52] so you [music] can use me. I give
[2:05:57] [singing] myself away.
[2:06:01] [music]
[2:06:04] I give myself [singing]
[2:06:06] away
[2:06:07] so [music] you
[2:06:09] can use me. For my life is not

[2:16:39] Is your heart singing this morning?
[2:16:42] Amen. And my heart will sing.
[2:16:46] How great. Just a few days ago, the
[2:16:48] doctor said, "You may not ever even walk
[2:16:50] on that foot again." He come back here
[2:16:52] and had his cowboy boots on. And he
[2:16:54] said, "I had told me I couldn't even
[2:16:56] wouldn't even be able to put pressure on
[2:16:57] him." But he's dancing all the way
[2:16:59] around the office just doing just doing
[2:17:01] circles back there. You know why? Cuz
[2:17:03] his heart sings, [music] "How great is
[2:17:06] his God."
[2:17:07] &gt;&gt; Amen. I think our God is great.
[2:17:10] &gt;&gt; He's You know what I I got in my pocket?
[2:17:13] I got my pocket three names. We have a
[2:17:15] prayer board in the back of the church.
[2:17:17] Me and Sister Judy was looking at it
[2:17:19] before before church. And [music] when
[2:17:22] we first started our our church here
[2:17:25] that we that that was a little prayer
[2:17:27] room [music] and of course half this
[2:17:28] building wasn't here had a curtain up
[2:17:31] across and the pull pit was over there
[2:17:33] by that window and and we had a little
[2:17:35] board back there for people to put names
[2:17:37] of pe members of their family or friends
[2:17:40] [music] that they had on their heart.
[2:17:41] They wanted to see them give their heart
[2:17:42] to the Lord. And people been struggling
[2:17:45] through things and they put their names
[2:17:46] on that board. And a lot of our young
[2:17:48] people have grandparents and parents and
[2:17:52] the saddest thing is to watch a young
[2:17:54] person put their parents' name on a list
[2:17:57] or their grandparents and it just it it
[2:18:00] it tears at your heart and [music] but
[2:18:03] they put those names and I was telling
[2:18:04] sister Judy I said I always walk by
[2:18:06] there and I'll take a moment and pray
[2:18:08] and pray over those names that are on
[2:18:10] there. And you know, I went by there
[2:18:12] this morning. I hadn't looked, hadn't
[2:18:14] [music] just taken and read each name in
[2:18:16] a while. And and I went by there and
[2:18:19] there's three people sitting in this
[2:18:20] church [music] that serve the Lord. I
[2:18:22] pulled y'all's names off that board this
[2:18:24] morning that somebody few months ago or
[2:18:27] maybe a couple years back had put your
[2:18:28] name up there on the board. Brother
[2:18:30] David Paul, your your name was one of
[2:18:31] them. I I took that that name off there.
[2:18:34] I about shouted in the back room. I
[2:18:35] thought somebody had it had it in their
[2:18:37] heart to put his [music] put his name up
[2:18:39] there on that list and and to remember
[2:18:41] him in prayer. And I thought, well,
[2:18:44] well, and we we prayed for him many
[2:18:45] times, but the grace of God
[2:18:48] &gt;&gt; went and found him and has him sitting
[2:18:50] in the in church and for serving the
[2:18:53] Lord, him and his family, and love the
[2:18:55] Lord. You know why? [applause]
[2:18:57] Because our God is a great God and he's
[2:19:00] a merciful God. And he he ain't a God
[2:19:02] that cares about the sins of your past
[2:19:04] or the failures of your God don't care
[2:19:06] one ounce about it. You're the only one
[2:19:08] that cares about that. God don't care
[2:19:09] nothing about it. He don't bring it back
[2:19:11] up. He don't even remember it no more.
[2:19:12] It's not even in his memory. You
[2:19:14] couldn't even make God remember it. He
[2:19:16] don't even know it. He made it in such a
[2:19:18] way that he couldn't even remember your
[2:19:19] sins.
[2:19:20] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:19:20] &gt;&gt; That when you come back to him and say,
[2:19:22] "God, forgive me again." He don't even
[2:19:23] know what it means to say again.
[2:19:25] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[2:19:26] &gt;&gt; Because he forgave you for it. and he
[2:19:27] put it beneath the blood and the be
[2:19:29] beyond the beyond the the the where you
[2:19:32] can't even find it no more the sea of
[2:19:34] God's forgetfulness
[2:19:36] because he's a great God
[2:19:39] &gt;&gt; and this church is filled with people
[2:19:40] that love God because he's a great God
[2:19:43] and our heart sings how great is our God
[2:19:47] destiny your name is on that list
[2:19:49] [music]
[2:19:49] I got your name up if I took it off the
[2:19:51] prayer board we'll still pray for you
[2:19:53] but she's serving the Lord
[2:19:56] &gt;&gt; a lot of these young people your name
[2:19:58] when you you went you may go through
[2:19:59] things. You know there's young people
[2:20:00] right now that's going through what you
[2:20:02] used to go through and and what we used
[2:20:04] to go through.
[2:20:05] &gt;&gt; I'm not kicking them out.
[2:20:07] &gt;&gt; I'm going to do the same thing I did for
[2:20:09] you and for your dad and your brother
[2:20:10] and your sister and your children. I'm
[2:20:12] going to pray for them just like I did
[2:20:14] for them. And I'm going to live a life
[2:20:15] in front of them. I'm going to keep
[2:20:16] trying to win them.
[2:20:18] &gt;&gt; I'M NOT PUTTING THEM OUT. AMEN.
[2:20:20] &gt;&gt; I'm going to keep trying to win them
[2:20:22] until they get something in their soul
[2:20:24] that anchors
[2:20:25] &gt;&gt; that the devil can't take them no more.
[2:20:28] &gt;&gt; That's my stand. [music]
[2:20:30] &gt;&gt; I'm going to keep winning them until
[2:20:33] they get an anchor.
[2:20:36] I thank God. He's a great God.
[2:20:38] &gt;&gt; He's a wonderful God. He's [music]
[2:20:41] worthy of our praise. Do you love the
[2:20:44] Lord this morning?
[2:20:45] &gt;&gt; Amen. As you go, tell somebody that you
[2:20:48] love him.
[2:20:50] Greet them in the name of the Lord and
[2:20:52] start the new year off. Go shake
[2:20:54] somebody's hand. You hadn't shook in a
[2:20:56] while. Say, "Brother, I love you. I
[2:20:58] appreciate your stand." You know, I
[2:21:00] notice I don't ever I don't ever talk to
[2:21:01] you, but I notice you you're always here
[2:21:03] and you're at your post of duty and I
[2:21:05] sure appreciate you. Something little
[2:21:07] about their life that you notice. Go
[2:21:09] tell them how much you love them and
[2:21:11] appreciate them. God bless you this
[2:21:13] morning [music] as you go. Sister
[2:21:15] Gabriel, God bless you. Thank you for
[2:21:17] coming and spending the holidays with
