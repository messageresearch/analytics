[0:08] that you are faced
[0:11] with circumstance

[0:34] and time again.

[1:50] &gt;&gt; I know he's the God of the stars.
[1:53] &gt;&gt; How many believes that

[3:01] when he'll do it again.
[3:07] &gt;&gt; Amen. Won't you give the Lord a hand
[3:09] clap of praise tonight? I believe he's
[3:11] not just a God of yesterday or a God of
[3:14] tomorrow, but he's a God of today.

[3:22] never forsaken us. He's kept He's a He's
[3:24] a keeper of his word.
