prophets told us Lord you're standing right here in this Tabernacle there's Angels encamped about us Lord God there's more for us here that's than against us Lord we believe that with all of our hearts tonight Lord we we pray that you come and manifest yourself Among Us One More Time bless the Saints here in Grace Tabernacle this evening Lord we pray in Jesus Christ's wonderful name amen God bless you you got your Bibles we'll invite you to Genesis chapter 22 and let's start the maybe the seventh verse everybody happy amen hope you're expecting as much as I am tonight and I say we could have church 7th verse of the 22nd chapter and Isaac SP unto Abraham his father and said my father he said here am I my son he said behold the fire and the wood but where's a lamb for the burnt offering and Abraham said my son God will provide himself a lamb for a burnt offering so they went both of them together and they came to the place which God had told him of and Abraham built an altar there and laid the wood in order and bound Isaac a son laid him on the altar upon the wood and Abraham stretched forth his hand and took the knife to slay his son and the angel of the Lord called unto him out of heaven and said Abraham Abraham he said here am I he said lay not thy hand upon thy lad neither do thy thing unto him for now I know that thou fearest God seeing thou Hast not withheld thy son thy only son from me and Abraham lifted up his eyes and looked and behold behind him a ram caught in a Thicket by his horns and Abraham went and Tuck the RAM and offering him for the burnt offering into instead of his son and Abraham called the name of this place Jehovah Gyra as he said to this day in the mouth of the Lord shall B it shall be seen and the angel of the Lord called unto Abraham Out of Heaven the second time and said by myself I have sworn sayeth the Lord for because thast done this thing and H has not withheld thy son thy only son that in blessing I Will Bless thee and multiplying I'll multiply the seed as the stars of the Heaven and the sand which is upon the seashore and thy seed shall possess the gates of his enemies amen God bless you just ask the Lord to bless the reading of his word tonight and we last time we was with you we shared a few things with you and uh ma just uh here maybe two months ago and I think brother Matt was uh maybe on vacation I took a service for him and uh I I Minister on I give you the land and and uh on this trip we uh we got to diing back into these things and and uh just been just a stirring on my heart and just seen the Holy Spirit uh move uh and in our meetings uh and North Carolina and South Carolina and just just pray the Lord can bless you the same tonight and I know he's a he's a god when he's moving he's moving and we was we was actually um at both locations brother Matt at at brother Josh's and brother Luke Gibson's and and uh it it's it's strange because you hear the same things that you hear here when we brother Mt vites feels led to invite somebody here and brother Ben it's not a coincidence a lot of times that uh that brother said man that guy just picked up where I left off or he he started dealing with the same things I was dealing with and and we find the that's just the mind of God and and God's moving and we heard those things this weekend and I couldn't put it together but God put it together and we've seen the the sick healed and delivered and I believe the Lord's just moving in a special way for the Bride of Jesus Christ can you say amen and we' like to pick some of those thoughts up tonight and and and maybe carry just a little father by by by God's grace tonight and if you'll just bear with me tonight but we took this scripture here in the 17th verse that the Lord is telling Abraham this is unconditional that blessing I Will Bless thee and multiply and multiply and I'm going I'm going to bless thy seed and they're going to possess the gates of their enemy and we realize tonight this is beautiful tonight that you as a Believer can escape the bless blessing there's nothing in time sister Eve can prevent you from receiving the blessing or The Inheritance that God had in his mind before the foundation of the world he told us that the seat of Abraham was promis to possess the gates of his enemy and brother BR would say it like this brother Morgan when the when the Red Sea became a gate God came on the scene and removed the gate because the gate was blocking access or preventing the children of God from their blessings and they cannot escape the blessing that God has already given them before the foundation of the world and he would tell us God moved upon the scene and Tuck the gate and went away with it so there's no weapon that is formed against you can prosper we believe that God is a consuming fire amen God will consume anything that stands in between you and your promises amen for you as a Seed of Abraham cannot escape the blessings that God has bestowed upon you amen and we realize tonight that nothing in time can prevent you from inherent the blessing Moses couldn't escape it the three Hebrew children could escape the blessings of God Amen Daniel couldn't escape the blessings of God and I believe Brother David you and I here tonight in Grace Tabernacle amen that God has a blessing for you tonight and no imagination no conscience no memory no feelings amen can block you tonight if God's got a predestinated blessing for you tonight guess what sister Vana you're going to receive it amen God pre pre-ordained this service before the foundation of the world Amen and here we are tonight living it out in reality amen and I just believe God's got something special for Grace Tabernacle tonight not because I'm preaching because two or three are gathered in his name and expecting God to move whether it's brother Mark brother mat brother Joe hey beg God's going to meet that blessing tonight I just believe it amen he's on the road to manifest himself tonight and like I said in my prayer he said Jesus Christ is in this Tabernacle he there the angels are encamped about us tonight amen we I just believe sisters kind of all things are possible to them that believe now we notice here that Abraham thy seed shall sojourn in a Strange Land and that is not their own God begin to tell them that I will deliver them with a mighty hand and it's a promise and it's unconditionally but there came a time that had come a jubilee Exodus and that's what my God is tonight he's a god of restoration he's a god of Resurrection he's a god of the Exodus amen he don't and our God has brother Ben has never lost anything even he said Jesus said I come to seek and to find that which was lost amen those that has representation he can't lose a one of us he told us in the gospel Heen they've been engraved in the palms of my hands I can't lose one of them amen how many believes that thank you Lord that we as Believers tonight that God has you on his mind you was a part of him you was with him brother Amos he said if I'm a true American I I I'm identified in her shame name I'm identified in her glory I was there he said when Grom I was there on P Plymouth Rock I was there on the when they signed the Declaration of Independence amen I was there also in her shame in the Revolutionary War when we begin to fight one another because I'm American I'm identified in her shame I'm identified in her glory he said as a Christian I was there when he died at Calvary I was there when he he hung between the Heaven and Earth and his blood spil upon this Earth Amen to redeem a Lost Generation I was there when he ascended I was there when he descended heyen if you are a true Christian tonight you was existing in the mind of God before the foundation of the world we can't escape the blessing tonight amen it's already in his mind and nothing can change it amen if your son tonight nothing in time could ever change that a son can never lose his inheritance and nothing in time could ever change that can you say Amen though it's gloomy and dark at times and in this world Sister Sarah that we're living in it's dark gloomy but there is a Bible believer some where amen has accepted the message of the hour amen is covered by the blood of the of the lamb and has a token applied just like that night in Egypt amen when the when the death angel was passing by amen there was a lot of confusing on the outside there was a lot of noise going on on the outside there was a lot of crying going on in the outside but beyond the beyond the token Beyond on the blood behind the blood amen there was a group of Believers that was identified with the lamb and there was having Fellowship when the world on the outside was in confusion there was a peace behind the blood amen there was a there was a there was a joy they were singing Psalms behind the blood and the token and that's the way you and I are tonight as Believers amen when the world is confused the world don't to know if a man should be able to play in women's sports or use a woman's facilities amen they're confused out there but they they are a Believer amen that's not confused she's behind the blood she's identified with the lamb Hallelujah I you thankful for that now he's been preparing Moses for many many years for such a time is this and then came a time when Moses asked the Lord who shall I tell them that sit me and exodus will tell us and God said unto Moses I am that I am a present day God brother B say I am not I was or will be but I am a a living presence for eternity in other words just like Psalm says I'm an everpresent help in a time of trouble God doesn't abandon missions he didn't send Moses down as a oneman Invasion to abandon him when he got down there amen he he as a oneman Invasion going over taking out uh taking on the one of the greatest Nations Brother David amen when he got down there begin to call plagues we don't find God and abandon his man listen brother Amos God doesn't abandon he don't abandon missions amen he's a determined God Amen and he's determined that he cannot lose anything Amen in the Garden of Eden we find that that it looked like all creation was going to be lost but God begin to to to to to have something released within him that begin to scream out no what did he scream out I'm going to redeem I'm going to bring back that's who I am I cannot lose anything and then he begin to say all that was in me I'm going to pour in my son all that was in my son I'm going to pour into the Bride of Jesus Christ to have preeminence in a body to bring back what was lost in the garden all right cuz God can't lose anything you believe that brother BR says he's going down to take over against Shields and train Men by tens of thousand with a crooked stick in his hand he said stop him if you can there's nothing can stop him armies has failed many armies that came against Pharaoh but they every one of them failed but not the IM am Army Moses did not come to Egypt to compromise with Pharaoh Hallelujah no sir he had one mission brother Joe aen he said let my people go blus he didn't want to compromise he said he begin to tell him brother Morgan Heen we as an army we're going to take our kids we're going to take our family we're going to take our cattle he tells that Pharaoh we're not leaving a hood behind we are leaving this place this a a jubilee Exodus and God principle is an exodus that he's going to bring out and he's going to take something in oh aren't you thankful for that notice once they begin their Jubilee Journey the Red Sea wasn't deep enough the Red Sea wasn't wide enough Pharaoh's Army wasn't great enough and when they came to the Red Sea Moses tells himself says unto the people brother Matt fear not stand still yes sir in other words brother Travis don't stir from this position don't leave where you're at I got this oh if we could take that in our hearts tonight don't get the don't get dismayed don't get fearful by the things of life that's going on around us don't stir from your position cuz we serve a God Amen is well able to take us out and take us in he doesn't Abandon Ship he doesn't abandon missions and he's telling don't fear because Pharaoh's Army is coming in like a flood don't worry because the Red Sea looks uncrossable and he says don't steer from this position and see the salvation of the Lord which you shall show to you this day for the Egyptians you have seen today you shall see them again no more forever the Lord shall fight for you and you shall hold your peace Hallelujah then he tells them by little by little I will drive them out before thee until thou be increase and inherit the land then he says speak unto the children and say unto them when you have passed over Jordan the land of Canaan then you shall drive out the inhabitants of the land before before you and destroy all the pictures and destroy all the molten images and quite pluck down all the high places and you shall dispossess the inhabitants of the land and dwell therein for I have given you the land to possess it he's already says I already gave it to you it's yours now go and take it now I'm going to send my angel before you he says I'm going to prepare the way I'm going to send Hornets before you they're going to drive out the enemy I'll s my fear before you and I'll cause fear to set into the people and Satan cannot stand where God is we got an inheritance how many believes that brother BR said we got an inheritance amen our inheritance belongs to us can you say Amen can you sayare it with me the heritance belongs to me Amen to thank you brother Matt I knew somebody could do it tonight it's your privilege to have anything that you inherited right amen through accepting Jesus Christ Satan said well I tell you what you're going to do he says no you ain't going to tell me nothing he said I know my position in Christ and I'm not going to stir from my position and you just might as well get away I ain't listening to you no more I got an inheritance I got a title deed and it goes all the way back and brother R said God sent Jesus Christ to make the inheritance real to you and M to you and me it makes a makes it become a reality to you and I it's not just a Bible story it's not just a book that we read thank you Lord hallelujah an inheritance listen this I I'm fixing to preach inheritance by predestination inheritance by predestination in other words he forn knowledged he had knowledge of it so he predestinated it he gave you the inheritance listen what he says he says what it what what inheritance they had somebody to Lead Me inheritance he says you say Jesus left you an inheritance he said I beg your pardon Jesus never left me an inheritance what a statement he said he didn't leave you an inheritance either right he only come down to pay for your inheritance he listen he said he brought it to you he bought it to you he brought it to you but your name was put on the land's book of life before the foundation of the world God gave your inheritance The Inheritance he gave was first and Jesus came to make the inheritance real isn't that beautiful and time nothing in time can hold your inheritance glory to God I feel like praising praising God hallelujah he says Jesus didn't give you inheritance you a got your inheritance before the foundation of the world and you as a Believer can escape the blessing amen Brothers you can run for a season but God's going to find you you can hide under denominationalism you can hide under feelings you can hide in Mama and Daddy but there's going to come a predestinated time why because he can not lose a one of you you might have win a straight for a season because somebody preached somebody done you wrong somebody preached something wrong to you you lost confidence in Preachers you lost confidence in churches come on come on and Satan might have held your joy for a season and held your happiness for a season but if he received it in time he can never hold it if you receive something in time it's here today and gone tomorrow that's the reason why a lot of people can come to church and receive a good blessing and go out amen and go back to their sins go back to the the ways of their old life all right they feel the emotions they feel it but what happened to you what happened happen to you have you ever thought of this this this this before before today have you ever thought why God raised up brother Matt Morris and feel a desire an unction years after he begin ministering to open up this Tabernacle and you was laying out there and seeing somewhere laying out there and and and and and and beaten down by hell beaten down by the devil and no joy no happiness but this is the way God works oh bear with me tonight I got some Liberty tonight God God begin to work things out long before you ever knew he was just like he did the widow woman he dried up the brook chair he he commanded the rainers and quit feeding the man of God and told Elijah get thee up arise go down a zar path there's going to be a woman down there amen that woman had no idea I say we was that woman but God am been rich in Mercy says you cannot escape the blessing for I'm going to raise up a preacher I'm going to raise up a man of God ain't been long before you ever knew you thought your church days was over hey but we thought our church days are over Jared he but but what happened God came down to seek and toine that which was [Music] lost I'm going to get ahead of myself tonight but man this message is so good and he Simpson says go possess it it's yours they had to fight for every inch of it but it was assured that they would be given to him no matter what the results or the circumstances they had to fight for every inch of the way but they had the promise of Victory don't you feel that way tonight Hallelujah God oh just get with we're going to have some fun here in a minute God was proven to them his word but Xavier he was proving his word brother said that about the 10 spies that went over to to spy out the land he said it was God proven to them his word he knew he would have a Joshua and Caleb and before they ever entered into the land and then when they came back we find Caleb in the scripture tell them hold on a minute your eyes was on Giants in the land sons of anoch you was looking at you was looking at them as there was some big God and you looked in your own eyes you look like grasshoppers into their sight but there was something about Caleb amen he Ste the people and he said let us go up at once and possess it for we are well able sister Nisha to overcome it why because it was a jubilee Exodus Caleb had a revelation I cannot Escape my inheritance am Hallelujah and footsteps is possession and you step in one of those predestinated footsteps Satan cannot hold where God stands Satan loses his hold when you begin to walk in the footsteps that God predestinated for you to walk in and that's the reason why you're Victorious tonight that's the reason why you're shouting he and everything around you can be going on all right there can be feelings there can be emotion there can be they can be aggravation they can be hate there can be bitterness there can be Strife there can be a lot of things going on around you but you realize he said without circumstances nothing is going to stop this blessing that's Reon why as a Believer tonight I can come to Grace Tabernacle and Shout the victory knowing there people that hate me there people don't like me but it doesn't change me amen I cannot Escape The Blessing amen I know y'all going to shout here in a minute I give you the land the law of the land is to enforce it's by the land and for the land brother Brown says enforce means to give it back to restore bring it back to the right right owner the enforcement restored back to his natural conditions again Hallelujah he said devils are on the move you know this one of my favorite quotes for Jesus C Christ the chief Captain said my name they shall cast out Devils they failed to get it 40 years ago but we're coming in it now possessing the land the same Pillar of Fire the same Chief Captain is leading the host of the Lord it's your land God promised it he gave you this body it's yours by possession the devil's trying to take it over he hasn't got the authority to do it cuz he's a squatter he's trembling tonight listen Church brother brandham he spoke to a storm and the storm went out existing I say he's the same God tonight we find a woman brother r a woman was praying and her prayer came in contact with her God Amen and she pulled a storm into existence and he grounded a 747 airplane yes sir in Memphis Tennessee because there was a woman praying to her God the same God that took the storm out of existence for brother brandham was the same God that pulled the storm into existing for this lady and he's the same God tonight when you're in a storm don't fight your brother don't fight your sisters we don't fight against flesh and blood but principalities with dark places in our lives sir and the same God that done that for them can do that for you you say for me absolutely amen or he's not Jesus Christ the same yesterday today and forever you believe he is it's your land Joshua 14 says and now behold the Lord had kept me alive he said for 45 years even since the Lord spoke the word unto Moses while the children of Israel wandered in the wilderness and now Lo I'm this day four score and 5 years old as yet I'm just as strong this day I was in the day that Moses sent me as my strength was then even so is my strength now for war both the go go out and also to come in so what was a what was Caleb saying this is not my strength this is not my ability this is a god of Exodus amen and this principle of an exodus is the I'm going to I'm going to do this I'm going to work it out thy seed shall possess the gates of her enemy and it's unconditionally am yes sir and when a Red Sea came God came on the scene and moved the Red Sea out of the way and the children of God walked across on dry ground the same God he says a same God that overcome Jericho the same God that overcome the kings of eglon Amen the same God that allowed us across the Jordan and the Red Sea the same God that brought me out is the same God that's going to take me in cuz my God doesn't abandon missions sir Hallelujah and no doubt they said Caleb they are giants in your land yeah the sons of anic is inhabitant your land Giants Head and Shoulders above all they was known for their size and their strength but these sons of anoch was only Squad daers in Caleb's inheritance and Caleb had a revelation I cannot Escape my inheritance oh don't you feel that way tonight God didn't bring me this far to abandon now hallelujah amen and Caleb says Amen brother said bouncing up and down and hook those juice and screaming to the top of his lungs he's still my God the same God that brought me out is the same God that's going to take me in and he said give me my mountain and the sons of anoch couldn't hold it any longer they received it in time and they didn't have the ability to hold it all right amen good do you believe that yes sir he said what happens what happened Caleb had a revelation that nobody gave it to him but God when what happens in time can never supersede what happens in The Eternity healing is your possession amen salvation is your possession the Holy Ghost brother Noah is your possession I don't care how big they are I don't care what kind of spear they got how high their cities are wall how great it is our promise is the gate will be possessed by God's seed of God's children and we're going to take it over and we're going to take it over we're more than a match for them it's a

care what you've done I don't care what you've done prodal if you're a son amen come on now if you're son you have a right to return why because he said it's a jubilee time and and if you're a son you

nobody your second cousin you're defeated nobody likes you everybody hates you Satan has tormented your mind by your past all right and they just said Brother David God ain't interested in your past church we all got a past goe we all Sinners we all told lies we all want adulterers yes sir brother heard brother Donnie say one time he said he said What would most mes churches do if the woman at the well came walking through the back door all right five husbands and the one that she was living with in her own he said a lot of people would have kicked them out but God didn't I tell you a woman that was married five times and the one that she was living with brother amen could not escape the blessing everybody else gave up on her and I feel that way about you and I tonight amen churches

you you was finished good preacher yes sir but when that slave heard that Jubilee trumpet his response changed his speech changed his attitude changed he was living under the taskmasters whip he was under bondage he was under slavery amen glory to God Amen somebody else was on on his property but when the trumpet sounds there was a law at the sounding at the 50 after 7 weeks 7 time 7 49 years in the 50th year there's going to be a trumpet that sounds and all of you that's aen had to sell your land had to go into bondage all you a been had to go working under another man's field and you was a servant you was under his his headship his bondage but when you hear the sound it changes your attitude it changes your response and no doubt that same devil would come and tell you go ahead go do this and go do that talk about this person gossip about that church but you as a believer don't you heard the Jubilee sound you can say Satan get behind me in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ amen Satan cannot hold your land forever amen be because he received it in time and you received it from The Eternity and he's just a squatter he's only there because he received it under the law of that land inti oh brothers and sisters but Jesus came to make the inheritance real to you and I to let you know Satan can't hold that land forever amen he's got a season amen but it's going to come a predestinated inheritance that you as a Believer is going to embrace and you cannot escape the blessing and nothing can stop it your response is different and that devil says go do this says Satan you can't hit me one more time am yes sir I I was under your leadership I was under your bondage I was a slave to you but there was a jubilee Exodus amen I heard a sound of a voice you can't escape the voice you can't escape the sound and you say not today devil amen can you say that with me tonight Satan you came to the wrong place at the wrong time I'm not a I'm not under bondage I'm not in the slave house any longer I am free who the son has made free is free indeed and Jesus came to set you free and let you [Applause] know Satan Can't Hold Your Land forever oh isn't that power the beauty thing about it this slave don't have to go collect money he don't have to pay for it he don't have to go no no no no all he has to do is go receive it amen all he has to do cuz he has a right because of the sound of the trumpet at Jubilee year is go down to the enemy's camp and take back what belongs to him it's his I'm going home to my children I'm going home to my family Satan you've lied to me too long amen I'm telling you what my I am not going to leave a hood behind sir I'm going to take my children I'm going to take my house I'm taking everything why because it's my inheritance and Satan can't hold our inheritance forever Hallelujah don't you love him Joel says I will restore the years that the Locust of caner and calip po has eaten and you shall eat plenty and be satisfied hallelujah thank god he's a restorer he's a god of Resurrection yes he is he's not a god of replacement good no no no they go back to their land oh yeah yes sir it's ours amen it's not a replacement you don't get something different no no no you go back we just like a Garden of Eden he's lost it but he's taking us back that's just a three-fold purpose of being is to restore Eden because it was lost and God can't lose anything how beautiful is that and a son can't lose its inheritance forever people might talk trash about you they might make fun of you they might call you names names never hurt me you know names doesn't change who I am they can talk about me they can standal my name they can standal my church right at the end of the day I'm going on with Jesus just the same hey all down through the Bible Paul was ridiculed brother Brandon was still ridiculed men of God are always ridicule they're always knocked down cuz Satan hates he hates you he hates you he hates Believers amen he hates Grace Tabernacle he hates your home yes sir he hates your your your your church members yes sir he doesn't like you but it really doesn't matter what he likes just Jordan doesn't matter what the world thinks about you come on it doesn't change your value amen amen amen sir cuz our value don't come from time our value comes from eternity and there's something there that's backing you up yes sir but no I asked you if you wanted that $100 what would you say oh didn't he didn't say it very loud but he said yes sure he does but it doesn't matter what I do to it I can W it up I can say no you still want this $100 bill oh yeah I can drop it as a world and they can Stomp on it that's good they can put it through the mud sir they can do whatever they want to it but I said no do you still want it certainly why because the circumstan doesn't change the value yes sir amen there's a go somewhere backing this up and and he knows it and that's the way I believe the message of the hour has come to let you know your true value doesn't matter what the world thinks about you it does doesn't matter what the the churches think about you God seen value in a woman with five husbands and the one that she was living with wasn't her own but she held value there's gold somewhere backing her up she had representation when everybody else didn't warn her God says she's a value I right before the foundation of the world and Jesus came to make the inheritance real to the woman at the well and I believe this message she said my message is to declare he's here what is he here for to make the inheritance real to you I say church I don't care what anybody thinks about you tonight that's wonderful if you're a seed of God Amen you're of value yes sir amen amen God's watching over every one of your steps tonight amen thank you Lorden Hall he's watching over it what you mean I got so much tonight it's such good stuff and I'm telling you God's watching over you because you're a value there's blessings that God's got in store for you brother Charles he's got in store for you heyen in circumstances and time can't stop it GL Hallelujah he's protecting it brother man would tell us a story he took a whole sermon on it and he was talking about the time that this man raised up and he began to say oh Pharaoh long leave the king I can tell you what you're doing you could do this because this generation around us is growing like weeds yeah and what you could do is take the first the every male baby and Bash his head against the rocks and feed them to the alligators and crocodiles and the King said you know what that's a pretty good idea so they they put it in law and amram ran home to his wife jock and told her said honey I know we've been trying to have a baby I know what we're doing I just heard the king say and make this decree and he's he's hired these riches these women policemen brother say oh Lord imagine a woman policeman she's said real long fingernails all painted up and she was police in the city looking for every male baby and brother Brown said the angel of the Lord came down and visit amram and he began to tell him God remembers all of his promises and the angel Lord took his sword and he pointed it to the North cuz that was their promised land that was their inheritance because they brother Brown said they was an inherit that land and next year went by he told him he said you're going to have a baby about this time next year you're going to have a baby boy and he's going to be the deliverer course she went back to the sweetheart Jack big and told him said honey I got a visitation from the angel of the Lord he told me said we're going to have a baby boy and she said we can't have that those witches will find him so I know that God say he's going to give it I know God's going to protect him Hallelujah and I tell you honey when he pointed that sword to the north I see myself in that land I see myself crossing the Red Sea my time went on and joob is kept praying brother Brown said there a long story you can go back and listen to the message but he amram kept on praying and all of a sudden he got another visitation the angel of God come and told him told me told him all the things it's going to happen Jo don't worry God is ever presentent he's all knowing he's all powerful he's a mighty God he's a mighty deliverer don't fear don't fear and a year later went by and they had a beautiful baby boy and they begin to hideing in the basement every time they cried they'd run into the basement hide him every time she nured she went to the basement hide him and about three months later brother bam said he said those witches came by knocking at the door are you with me bear with me cuz this this is good and they begin to knock on the door brother mat let us in I woke somebody up didn't I wake up we know there's a baby maybe in there somewhere they came in and and those witches brother braham's cared the house looked under the bed looked in the closet looked in the Attic looked in the basement they looked all over the house and they could not find that baby boy I tell you why there was a shield of manipulant around him Hallelujah why because this baby could not escape the blessing this this baby wasn't just an ordinary baby he was designed for a great job Hallelujah you imagine the witches found every other baby they couldn't find this one and jaob said you know they're going to come back cuz when the witches were leaving brother B said they looked back to jaob and told her said you know what I know you're you're nursing I could tell I know you're your mother I know you that baby's somewhere in here and I'm going to find it time ran on few days and the Lord visiting again to ham RAM and told him said gave him the instructions how to deliver the baby oh mercy don't worry God's got this and his wife said honey have you been in the basement praying he said no I've been in the basement praising God how could you praise God in such a time as this oh my God's faithful this is how we fight our battles and he said what did he tell you told me that we got to get rid of this baby she didn't think it was a too good of an idea but he said we got to let it go so we can get it back he went to the basement he began to make this Reed basket and begin to pitch it with tar and sealed it up left a little hole at the top and so he could see the Sun and get some air and they cook him down there and the little baby tuck it down to the Nile River in the middle about 3:00 in the morning begin to put it out into the Nile River and the mother came down down sister Destiny and nursed it one more time and they came down they all kissed this little baby they pushed this little baby out into the Nile River and hamam instructed maram his daughter to follow it and see what happens during the day so maram took off and followed this little basket down the Sea of time and brother Brown said all of a sudden Mar's looking and here come a big log that was destroying everything in its path but when it came to the edge of this cargo there was a God on the other end because he said he told him said if there's something going on down in Earth if they're standing for me there there's something going on in the heavens and God already instructed all of his angels He brother Brown said he instructed Gabriel he said do not let anything touch that cargo that L brother Tom was just sitting there couldn't come closer and that basket kept on going down brother Jared and all of a sudden brother BR says oh those crocodiles begin to smother around that basket but it couldn't come nigh unto little Moses they tried with everything in them they was destroying every other baby they in the Nile River but not this one cuz Moses couldn't escape the blessing that's right brother and he went on down and there big Whirlpool there brother M and current was pulling everything down was taking every log every every animal every SI situation it just pulling it down but when that cargo got near to that war poool it just the baby brother John just H down the then he said there she was she lost vision of him a little bit there was a little Bank there brother Brown said she went around that bank and she got to looking out there all of a sudden that basket just hovered in the same place and she looked over there and there was beautiful girl Gardens brother BR said there's a big castle Mansion standing there she's looking Here Comes two guards out they grab these babies this baby and they bring it in they open it up the the daughter of pharaoh is standing there she opens it up and she said it's a baby boy he said it's just my my mean father that's trying to destroy these little babies and some Ling mother put this baby out of the N River for somebody hope for somebody to find it but my father won't get this baby cuz I'm going to take it for my own oh don't you see the Lord working it all out oh yeah and then brother Brown says there's Mariam standing there and said this is your opportunity and you know maram was taking notes all the way down cuz she's going to report back to Mama and Daddy what's going on she's taking her little log she she's taking notes of the crocodiles and she's writing it all down and and then the spirit of the Lord saying maram this is your time no if I speak he can have me killed but brother said God's got it all in control Mariam step out maram says you know what cuz she was looking for a mother to nursing he says you know what I know a lady I know a woman can nurse this baby and M and the daughter of pharaoh said go go fetch her and she wrote all of it down brother man she got down there and she ran back to the house as hard as she good brother BR said got down there says and the mother and father said tell us man what what happened I got to eat first I'm hungry feed me some breakfast and I'll tell you everything that's happened ma'am tell us what happened I said Satan had a plot but God had a plan Hallelujah and maram begin to tell us that you ain't going to believe this I was watching our baby brother floating down an aisle and here come a dangerous log to kill our brother it was destroying everything in its path but I'm here today there was an angels encamped around God's Prodigy there was an angels camped around the blessing and the law could not come nigh unto our baby brother no doubt they had a little Jubilee amen he said that's not the that's not all of it mother I'm telling you you know all those crocodiles that's been eating all those babies they tried everything that was in them but they could not touch that basket and maybe maybe Abraham said praise the Lord he told me it would happen just like this he instructed me I just stood on God's word oh can we do that tonight church amen as Believers can we stand on God's word and watch God work in our behalf tonight amen listen friends that was the blessing that could not be destroyed and I say tonight you're a value Church you are a priest and a cargo just like Moses was because he has made you priest Revelation tell he's made you priest and you sister Debbie you cannot Escape The Blessing he says mom you ain't going to believe it there was a Whirlpool sucking everything in but soon as Moses got up to that it just calmed down oh it's a way it works in our life church we get all upset and nothing's going right everybody hates me nobody's but if we'll just lean not to our own understanding and wait upon the Lord he said wait upon the Lord he's going to renew your strength when the enemy comes in like a flood I'm going to lift up a standard against him don't get in a hurry just wait on God he's an on time God he's never late he's always on time he says mom that ain't the best I've seen the baby just hovering in the same position when everything else in the Nile River was going at a top speed and they came out and the daughters of Pharaoh's was there present and you ain't going to believe this mother you remember when Daddy told you that we'll let this go God would bring it back again I'm here to tell you when she begin to look for a woman woman to nurse that little baby that she called Moses because it came out of the water she come and she told me to come and fetch you that you was going to be the first mother ever got paid to nurse her own baby hallelujah amen and brother brother said you know what she told her that she's going to pay you $300 a week I don't make that sometimes times how long ago was that $300 a week and brother R said you know what she offered her a place to stay in the palace he said and he gave us a password cuz they wouldn't let us our kind come down there so she got us a password that we can go through the guards and go all the way down to the promised land right where God he could they couldn't escape the blessing amen church that baby went down the Nile River God protected that baby God was there and when the alligators kind to attack him God was there when the whirlpool tried to take you under God was there when churches gave up on you God was there when there was no hope for you or your family God was there he will never leave you or forsake you he'll be with you I forgot the password I should have wrote it down I believe what was it hay and a pitchfork I think is what brother rown said something like that hay and a pitchfork he said they came to the guards yeah they said you can't come in here your kind is not allowed in the palace but we got the password hey in the Pitchfork oh going in oh don't you feel that way tonight I say the message of the hour has gave us a password amen there's guards trying to keep us hell's trying to keep us amen but we got the message of the hour to meet the challenge of this day I'm here to tell you Church don't give up the squatter can't keep the land forever if you're a son it doesn't matter where you are you can never lose the inheritance Hallelujah and the squatter can't keep it forever because you're no longer a servant you're a son and your son you're the heir to all promises it's impossible to keep God from restoring what has been lost yeah it's a journey sure it is and when you're ready to quit and you're ready to give up that under guring power is there to brace you up brother brandham did you keep your religion no it kept me it held me up when I was ready to give up it was there to defend me Lift Me Up encourage me and were kept by the power of God who did it God did it when brother Brown

to come home who did it God did it God works everything out for your good he's working it out right now just like Moses was in cargo they been floating down the Nile River we are trapped in some cargo and 2024 fixing usher in 25 amen it's great darkness and confusion but the beauty of that cargo it was sealed amen it had a seal of prop promise amen and when he places a sell of Promise upon your life amen he packs in everything that you have need of to make every Journey Every Mountain Climb Every desert Crossing every sea Crossing every curve every circumstances guess what he packed in there everything that you have need of even the raptures already within you I say we're going to make it church amen there's some great crocodiles trying to take your life right now don't worry about them remember I fix the clothes I've got a lot left amen they knocked at the window brother said they they knocked and haunted at the window and knocked at the door knocked at the window but that's all the devil can do the devil's on the outside and the Holy Ghost is on the inside and God's watching over you in this t i stand in Jesus Christ and angels are enced around this Tabernacle right now church I wonder how many times that a car was fixing a pull out in front of you and God held it back but Amos how many times was one of those big logs about to fall on you but God was sitting there holding it back oh yeah how many times brother Noah you was working on a vehicle probably forward and something something was fixing to happen and God was right there to help you out hallelujah how many times I was driving around with a wagon full of uh 15 lbs of watermelon calou on my trailer my brakes hadn't worked half the summer how many times was there a god there watching over me slowing me down amen maybe it's a phone call says brother Joe what you doing and when I begin to talk on the phone ask my wife I just begin to drive 45 50 mph how many times has somebody called me and there was somebody there was God angels encamped about me holding back the logs of Life holding back the crocodiles of Life holding back the world pools of life I'm here to tell you why because you cannot excape the blessing hallelujah thank you Lord and nothing in this world's going to hold us Jesus borrowed a tomb and he gave it back if you're a Believer we only borrow it for a season grave doesn't change it church if we go by the way of a g grave we still can escape the blessing amen amen I've got ones yes sir Sister George we got loved ones Sister Janice we got loved ones many of us here has had to go through a treacherous times we had to go through our Gethsemane but what brings a peace when there's so much confusing on the outside what brings a peace in our heart is this fact they can't keep the land forever we are promised Resurrection we are promised a Rapture and the dead in Christ shall rise first There Ain't No Grave going to hold that body down because it can't escape the blessing Hallelujah I say tonight we as Believers we cannot be defeated oh Hallelujah don't you love him I probably exhausted all of my time tonight but the fact of it is you can't escape you can't escape it brother Brown couldn't escape it brother Matt you couldn't escape it I can tell you probably part of you said don't want no church I want be no Pastor don't want to do that cuz against my nature and

some more in there amen there's another message there's another song there's another Deliverance in the world there's confusion and chaos but in the side of this cargo there's a song comes in a heart the Lord is my shepherd I shall not want surely goodness is running running after me amen hallelujah it's a true church say brother Joe you're just trying to h a pastor I don't have to H him up brother Matt knows I love him I'm just saying God is working this out I don't care what churches say around us I don't care what political Ides going on around us I know for a fact God has called us here for a purpose and that purpose is to fulfill the blessings that God had in his mind before the foundation of the world Satan's held you I'm closing seriously tonight Satan's held you for a season Satan's held you back for some time but it sister Destiny it was only for space of time because sister Destiny could not escape the blessing Hallelujah and I don't know how it happened but God created the songs will be sung the prayers will be say said Heen the preacher the preach what for for you sister Destiny just for you absolutely how do I know that cuz God did it for me I didn't go looking for him he came looking for me Hallelujah Lord and when I heard that Jubilee Exodus and that Revelation Dropped In My Heart s brother Amos it's a revelation that God's bringing me out of something and it's his principle if he brings you out he's going to take you in and Satan might have hold it for some time brother being but he can't hold it forever amen we've been fellowshipping around this we've been both excited it's an inheritance your mom and dad didn't give it to you we extend to our feet tonight the world didn't give it to you brother Brown even broke it down sister deie said Jesus de give it to you you got your inheritance first and it happened in eternities and brother John no matter what happens in time can't change what God thought about brother John before the foundation of the world hallelujah we're all scarred human beings we got scars that we've had from our previous life brother Kobe I've got scars you got scars you got scars I told Brother Luke Gibson church I said no none of us would won our pth plashed up on the [Music] wall but through all of that God could not give up on you thank you Lord and he knew Satan couldn't hold it forever Hallelujah and when you heard that Jubilee sound you could drop whatever you're doing look back in the Taskmaster said you can't hit me one more time my family's [Music] mine it's my inheritance I thank the Lord for my [Music] children greatest testimony I have is my children I was out North Carolina and somebody come up to you said bro Joe such a blessing for all your children serving the lord all I know I taught them you can't make it on my experience I can't save you and church wasn't an option it's something that we did because we love [Music] God and as much I love my children my father loves me and then when he looks down and said brother Tom this is my son who I'm well pleased this is my victory Look Around Church brother said this is his victory he's excited this hour as he was just excited when he came down and told and screamed out from the heavens this is my son whom am I well pleased to dwell in what do you think about Christ in his body [Music] Hallelujah I read this quote I got to read this brother Brown said the bride body must can you say must with me follow the head for it's a part of his resurrection and the part of the mystery it's impossible for it not to go oh isn't that beautiful Christ is the head of the body and we're a part of his resurrection no wonder he say what a resurrection that was but what a resurrection this is he said for the part of his resurrection is a part of his mystery we are the part of his mystery and we're a part of his resurrection and brother Ben it's impossible for it not to go he says oh my it's part of God's mystery how God revealed himself here and raised it up by his word hallelujah how is he lifting it up by his word cuz his word cannot come back to void his word can't be conquered his word was from The Eternity and nothing in time can stop I say it's impossible for you not to make it tonight can you give the Lord a hand clap of Praise Hallelujah brother Amos you can't lose your help forever and only hold it for so long a squatter owns it by time for that reason he can't hold it for when Caleb comes down because he got it from eternity he comes down and says get off my land can we do that tonight can you lift your

blow but he has no weapons no weapon formed against you shall prosper we're going to make it as Moses made it down to the daughter of Pharaoh's house and became Lord God a powerful man in Egypt to depart from Egypt for a journey out in the desert and meet the pillar of fire and brother Bram said Moses lacked what the pill of fire had Lord it took out everything that's unlike him all the military experience he had Lord and you gave him a rod in his hand you said a rod in moses' hands is Christ in ours and he went down and a jubilee Exodus to lead God's people out of bondage into a promised land and that was where Caleb went Hebron Lord he embraced that land he went over God's evidence of his promised land and he came back can so energized Lord this is my a good land flow of milk and [Music] honey Lord God he never got his eyes off of that Vision that he was going to go home he's going to his inheritance Lord and I believe it's the same way brother B said they failed to

Heaven above and oh how humbly you came to the Earth you created and All for Love say my what a plan of God so here I am here I am to worship here I am to bow down here I am to say that you're my God you're all together lovely yes you are worthy you're so wonderful yes Here I Am Lord here I am to bow down lord I come to say you're my God all together lovely yes you're worthy you're so wonderful to me amen can you give the Lord a hand clap of praise tonight isn't he worthy of the worship amen what a a mighty God I think just a wonderful message brother Joe delivering some some I'll just call it like this Bible principles amen amen that you belong to God and you were created of God before the foundation of the world and no I didn't tell brother Joe our phone conversation but God knows amen he knows what we have need of Amen do you believe that I believe God can directly speak to our heart and answer questions that we asked that no man would have an answer to but God that's our God and God is Sovereign and God comes in the when you're least expect it and he speaks to your heart and he he settled something in your mind that you've been struggling with or questions that you had and and he'll use the weakness of our flesh isn't that something the ignorance of preaching the Bible said or the foolishness of preaching that men are saved I believe that's our God we don't have a we don't have a a thought coming but God is God is a God that can take men and and out of the mouth of men God can SP he can still speak to us a't he a wonderful God Amen I just thank him for it it just amazes me what God is able to do when we surrender to his will amen I just love the Lord I appreciate that message you know he said that God had it in control all the time and M if you had time just to preach the uh the the message of the River of Life what a powerful thought that is of going down the River of Life and directing all the uh the things that would come our way and I believe that one day we'll sit over on the other side and the Lord will show us all the things that we didn't even know he did can you imagine sitting there you got all eternity for God to say you know all that time you thought I wasn't doing anything but look at all this stuff God was doing I love hearing those stories about all the the different avenues that God takes and and we don't even know why it's happening but God has it all in control I believe believe that you know in in 2002 the the Congress uh there was an act of Congress by that was led by George Bush called the No Child Left Behind Act and they purposed that there wouldn't be any child that didn't have any education they wouldn't be left behind in any of the schools and you know there's been great debates on whether that was whether it came to pass or whether it would F or succeed or whether it would fail but I thought you know long before that God had a No Child Left Behind that and it certainly succeeded because Jesus said I've never wasn't one that the father ever given me that won't come to me and when he comes to me I will not cast him out but all that the father has given me they will come unto me you know why because we belong to God and he has never left a child behind do you believe that tonight I believe that God had a message for our heart to let you know when you belong to God he don't leave you behind he ain't going to leave you out but everything he promised you is going to come to you amen can you praise the Lord for it tonight isn't he wonderful God Amen how you enjoyed that message tonight amen it really spoke to my heart amen I I know the Lord really used brother Joe tonight and and spoke some things that he wouldn't even be be privy to I'm not that kind of a pastor I've never no one ever counsels with me that I repeat it to somebody else I don't talk about it to other brothers it it it go I don't talk about it with my wife it goes to the Grave that's between you and me and the Lord but I know God knows what we have need of Amen I believe that I believe you you can always rest assured that when the Lord's speaking to you cuz sometimes it's so direct you had to tell them but it's just the Lord that's the way the Lord works I appreciate God for that amen do you love him tonight amen we just look forward to the service Sunday and going to do our best to deliver our Christmas message to you on Sunday morning what the Lord's put on our heart and and certainly looking forward to that and I really I really enjoy uh this time of year I enjoy the fellowship and uh I've always always kind of been a little bit of s y uh for Christmas time and and I love the you know the joy that it brings and that's what it should do that's what the Christmas story ought to bring and I know the world has tried to change it to something else but no matter what they change it to we still have a Christmas story and it's still real and and I'm so thankful for all that that God has uh done for us and so just be praying and you know if you can give somebody a extra encouragement or something in this season it would be a a good thing to do a little gift a little word or a text or a uh just just a word of encouragement I believe that's that's what we're called to do Amen to be a light in a time of darkness and so here uh we have an opportunity and we just we just thank each one of you for all that you do for the Lord and I just be praying about our services upcoming and also our trip there to India I know some had had given to support the trip and we certainly appreciate that and it's all welcomed and so we we actually have to take care of the the service and the venue those Brothers a lot of the uh the in or the money to do that they don't have the ability to do so we're trying to uh assume that that debt just to be able to make sure that we have a meeting of several thousand people that we'll be able to minister to and just a few days and so I believe that God has something in store uh for them as well and so we certainly appreciate the support in that so let's just bow our heads together and as we go just remember our services in prayer gracious Heavenly Father father Lord we thank you once again Lord and God for coming and speaking to our heart Lord we thank you for a service Lord that we could just surrender to you and Lord we just thank you for the word Lord that was delivered and Lord I pray God that you would strengthen our brother and Lord I know he's preached several services in a row Lord and Lord I know how the body just begins to toil him but Lord I pray that you would strengthen him Lord Brother Andrew and God he's been troubling his back and Lord I know that the enemy would do all that he could to uh just to destroy him but Lord I
