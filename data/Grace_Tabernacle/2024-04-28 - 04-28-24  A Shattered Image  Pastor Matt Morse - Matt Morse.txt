upon her life because what was said it may not made much sense to a lot of people but to her she said that ain't nothing but the truth amen amen I believe that ought to be our confession to say Amen to the word of God Amen you love the Lord this morning amen how many's happy to be in church say amen amen I believe we got a right to amen we just want to remember these in prayer this morning before we before we uh read our opening scripture it says please pray for Jasper Henry son he's had had a a tibul broke and is being in leonor's Monday in a full leg cast also for uh Sunny uh is home sick

speaking in Louisiana this morning just remember uh them in prayer the Lord be in their service and if you have a need on your heart just lift your hand to the Lord I believe God knows what we have need of and I've just been just been uh into the the word over the last few days and just I just love it when the Lord just pours stuff out and just man it gets you more excited than the people are but M if you're half as excited to to hear it as I am to speak it when the Lord's going to really move amen I believe that I believe that when people come in expectation to receive something from God that God is obligated to give them something that's cuz he gave it in his word he said he would do it and I believe he'll do it can we just pray together and maybe if you have a need on your heart w't you just ask the Lord to come and speak to us and and that he would receive the glory for all that's done this morning gracious Heavenly Father Lord we're so thankful Lord to be able to come and gather together with a body of Believers and Lord we come to do our service Lord to be able to come to worship you this morning and Lord we we have sang songs and given worship and we've we've we've done according to your word Lord and God we ask you Lord that now that the the scripture would be read that the word would go forth and Lord that the enemy that would come in amongst us Lord and that been tormenting lives Lord would have no place and God I pray Lord that you would have such a liberty this morning Lord that you could move me out of the way Lord forgive us of our failures and shortcomings and Lord all the things that we that we encountered but Lord I pray that you would have your will this morning God may you speak to every heart and those that are sick would be healed Lord those that have needs that their needs to be met Lord that we go from this place that we would give you the glory for the the richness of your mercy that you've given us today Lord we thank you for it in the name of Jesus Christ we pray amen amen we just want to invite you to the scripture uh to the Book of Exodus and we're going to read out of the 20th chapter and the first verse and and uh we just read for the first five verses and my isn't it just good to to be able to come to church on a Sunday morning amen how many fought to get here don't answer that amen some of you driving down the road and getting into the having to fight to get up and fight to get dressed and fight driving down the road just to get to church and and don't worry you're wearing it all over you so just may as well just let it go when you come in and and just have church amen you we're here anyhow the fight's over the struggle you left the struggle in the car so uh we come in to get something from the Lord how many lift your hand say I come to get something from God Amen how many believe he's willing to give it to you amen I believe he is amen let's just read Exodus the 20th chapter and the first verse and uh the Bible this is the of course the very familiar reading of scripture uh but the Bible says and God spake all these words saying I am the Lord thy God which have brought them out of the land of Egypt or brought thee out of the land of Egypt and out of the house of bondage Thou shalt have no other gods before me Thou shalt not make unto thee any Graven image or any likeness of anything that is in heaven above or that is in the earth beneath or that is in the water under the Earth Thou shalt not bow down thyself to them nor serve them for I the Lord thy God am a jealous God visiting the iniquity of the fathers upon the children under the third and the fourth generation of them that hate me we'll just ask the Lord to add His blessings to the reading of the word this morning as you take your seats I want to speak on uh this subject on a shattered image a shattered image now uh I know that this is a very familiar uh portion of scripture and and uh of course all of our young people the these young kids that have these wonderful Sunday school teachers every one of them could read to us the Ten Commandments and uh probably quote them better than we could and and uh but this is the the scripture where Moses had first brought the uh Ten Commandments and read them over the children of Israel and and of course you you realize that there were you know many Commandments there was the command to give uh to keep the Sabbath day to keep it a holy day I'm not going to preach on each one but one of them is a lesson and and a great message that so often times get put back in uh into into some old Covenant or something that don't matter anymore but they ought to mean something to us and uh but but but it was to the keep remember the Sabbath day and keep it holy and uh and then and to and thou shalt not commit murder or to kill or shall not commit adultery or Thou shalt not steal or Thou shalt not bear false witness against thy neighbor and or don't covet thy neighbor's house or his wife or servants or things that he had in other words that uh that the spirit of jealousy would have no place in The Believer but whenever you look through the Commandments that God had made you realize that this must have been something that was important to God it was the first thing that he mentioned when Moses uh uh came to give the Commandments and uh it was the first one that was established of the Ten Commandments and and it wasn't a little thing to God whenever you I won't read them all this morning but when you read through the things that God had said through the Old Testament of the people that had disobeyed this commandment it was of a great uh it was of a great punishment that God would bring upon one that wasn't obedient to this command that God had made and uh matter of fact in the book of Deuteronomy the Bible says uh to him that standeth here here Moses would give the order of those that would break this law that that would have a Graven image or they would they would bow to another God or have an idol and and but but as he would would speak to Moses he said it those that stand here this day before the Lord and also him that is not here he said you know how we have dwelt in the land of Egypt and how we came through the Nations which you passed by and you have seen their Abominations and their idles of wood and stone and silver and gold which are among them God began to talk to them about their journey and how uh the things that they had passed and the cities and the Nations and and God called their attention to all the things that they had came by and he said this is how the world lives and this is how this nation lives and this is the gods that they have and and some are of wood and some are of stone and and you pass by these great many Abominations and their Idols he said but lest there be should be some among you a man or a woman or a family or tribe whose heart would turn away this day from the Lord Our God to go and serve the gods of these nations unless there should be among you a root that would beareth Gall and wormwood and it would come to pass that when you would hear the words of this curse that you would bring a blessing or bless yourself in your heart and say that I shall have peace and and I can walk in the imagination of my heart he said then you've added drunkenness to thirst he said for the Lord will not spare him but when the anger of the Lord and his jealousy shall smoke him against that man and all the curses that are written in this book shall lie upon him and the Lord shall blot out his name from under the heaven this is a great thing to God for for for to have another God or idolatry or build up an image and he said he would blot his name out from under Heaven the Bible the Bible would tell us any of you that are Bible studiers this morning you realize that God didn't just say that but God did it and uh remember last Sunday when we were preaching on the sins of jeroboam and how that jeroboam had taken a golden calf and he had put one in in Dan and and the other he had placed in the city of Beth remember when he he said it's too much to go to Jerusalem to worship God so we'll we'll just make it easier to worship and we'll put a golden calf over here in Dan and it'll make it a little less journey and and he put priests over it and they made sacrifices unto it and they and they built a temple for the uh for a golden calf to be worshiped and they they they copied basically all the things that you would do in order to rightfully worship God but the only problem is is they took God out of it and so they replaced it with another God so they still went through the motions they still came to church and they they still lifted their hands and they still said amen and they still praise the Lord and they still made sacrifices they still you could take it to a modern day and they still spoke in tongues and they still prophesied and they and all the things that would that would that would appear to be things of God but the problem is is that they took God out of it and they replaced it with a golden calf and so so what good is all the noise and what good is all the uh of the of going through the motions of going to church and being and and and and and being there on a Sunday and making the sacrifice if there's no God in there to worship and so so you see but when they replac these Gods the Bible would tell us that the one was in bethl now how many knows that bethl was a city that was on the border of Ephraim which was one of the original tribes of Israel and of course Dan being a tribe of Israel you can find that in the book of numbers and many places in the Old Testament but you'll notice that that in the Book of Revelations whenever the whenever God begins to speak of the 144,000 and 12,000 from each tribe would be called out of Israel that when you read in Revelation 7 that no longer is Dan and Ephraim listed in the tribes of Israel so see God didn't just say that I'll remove their name out of the book but God did it he removed that that whenever you read of the tribes of Israel no longer are they even listed the places that had an idol in them the places where the people went to worship the Bible said that when they put those Idols in those cities that it caused everybody to sin it it caused people to fall you realize the danger of an idol that's built up it wasn't just jeroboam that it caused jeroboam to fall but because he built up an idol and he established it before the congregation and now it caused the congregation to follow after the wrong thing and it caused the congregation to to go and it was an easy way and it was an easy God to serve and he didn't have the laws like God had and he he didn't have the there wasn't such a the pressure and you know it just seemed like an easier way to serve God him but the Bible said that their name was removed from the book listen and God said and the Lord shall separate him and unto evil out of all the tribes of Israel according to all the curses of the Covenant that are written in the book of the law so that the generation to come of your children that shall rise up after you the stranger will come from AAR land and he'll say when they see the plagues of that land and the sicknesses which the lord has laid upon it and that whole land thereof is brimstone and salt and burning and swn down down and and nor beareth and no any Grass Grows and like the overthrow of Sodom and gomorra and adman Zeon which the Lord overthrew in his anger and his wrath even all the nations shall say wherefore hath the Lord done this unto this land what meaneth the heat of his great anger the men shall say because they have forsaken the Covenant of the Lord God of their fathers which he made with them when he brought them forth out of the land of Egypt for they went and they served other gods and they worshiped them Gods whom they knew not and whom God had not given unto them his Fury would be so great that Brother David whenever whenever people would ask what did they do to cause such a thing what did they do to cause the anger of God to be kindled against them in such a way what did they do to bring such a curse upon their life and then the men would say because they raised up an image before God they they've raised up something and they've went from worshiping God and they've raised up this great image and made it Christianity or or made it made it the god they made an image and they made some other God they made a Graven image and you realize that whenever God would say this he would say there should be no image there would be no graven image made there would be nothing that would come between me and you you say why would this mean so much to God I'm just laying a foundation here but but you realize that whenever God made this Commandment that this came after a time when images were there there were many images that were made the Nations that they passed through other nations and rulers they had their own God they were any other Nation outside of Israel they were following after their own God they had their own deities they had those that they worshiped they had they had Idols that they had built up when God gave the law to Moses you think about it when he said you shall have no God he said because I delivered you and you were in a hopeless State you were in a place of bondage you you were it was when you had no hope but I came in and I delivered you out of that place listen listen as God be to before he ever even spoke to him he said I want to remind you who our our relationship and I want to remind you where you were whenever I called you and I want to remind you of what you were in and what you were wrapped up in and the things you were in and the things your family was going through whenever I came and I called you out of it and I I released you from bondage and I established you and I made a way for you and I established your goings and I and I called you out of this state of bondage to give you a place that you could freely worship me God said I I called you from this place you think about it the way that God would look on it as he would as he would bring them from this place you realize that they had that they had just came from hundreds of years of bondage and living under the influence of an Egyptian culture and religion this this this Israelite Nation when God called them you realize that they lived in the land of Egypt and the Bible would tell us or actually history would tell us that in the land of Egypt that there were 1,500 Egyptian gods that are known by name outside of the ones that we don't even know the name to but but you can see these gods and uh uh uh through the the civilization brother brother Tim has a has a photo that but but all through the tombs you'll see the Egyptian gods they were written on hieroglyphics they were put in tombs they were when someone was buried they' put the God that was the god of that family and they would draw the image of it over their uh over their tomb or their or their family gravite but you realize that there were there were so many of them 1500 there was no way to go to go through it all this morning but but when you look at these Gods this this that's the god of oseris which is the the the great one of the greatest Gods a major God and then annabis which is a minor God and Horus who's a great God which was which is said to be the son of of ocus and and one of the one of the female gods and but that that picture is actually a a real picture that's thousands of years old that that was in the valley of kings in the Tomb of horb and so so there this is what Israel came out of this is the nation that they were in these are the children of God I I'm putting that there to to plant a seed this morning there that everywhere they look this is the imagees they looked at when they walked down the streets of Egypt these are the great images that they saw and there were there were so many gods in Egypt they were can I can I just lay a few down here but but there was AER that was the god of the earth and Ammon who was the creator God the deity of Egypt and and an her a god of war and a god of Honey a which was a Sund this deity that that was a a great a great God Adam which was a Creator God a solar deity benu which was a solar God which was depicted as a heron and then jab which was an earth God and happy which was the god of the of the Nile flood Horus which was a major God he was usually shown as a falcon or as a human child he linked him with the sky and kingship and protection and healing and all those things uh uh kepri which was another solar God he was often treated as the as the mourning form of the god raw who would come in the evening and so in the morning they would worship this God in the evening then they they would worship God or or raw and so and then and then Nam or neemu he was a he was a ram God he was a patron deity and and that would control the floods of the waters and he would give life to the gods and life to the humans and and then consu which was a moon God Mahesh which was a lion God Manu the God of War nerum which was a the god of lotus NTI which was a falcon God he was worshiped in middle Egypt he he was the one that appeared as the fairy man if you ever seen the myth of the Egyptian gods he he was the fairy man uh uh greater gods and then Neer which was the god of grain so then ocus which we've seen the picture of which was which was the god of death and Resurrection he he's the one that that that they would say that was the ruler of the underworld he he kept an eye on things after you died and to determine where where you would come back in this afterlife and and so and then T which was a a Creator deity and the god of Memphis and set which was ambivalent God there Shu which was the god of the wind or the god of the air sobec which was the Crocodile God that was that was worshiped by by comomo the great uh the great uh uh group and and and sdu which was the god of the sky tho which was a moon God the god of writing and the god of scribes and and then wwor which was a which was the god of the Mediterranean Sea so every every great place every river every sea Every Mountain every every great thing in Egypt had a God that you could worship so if whatever you had need of there was somebody to go to that would certainly be able to to bring it to pass even even the the the the women had their own Gods the female counterpart of Ammon which was ammonet anakate which was The Feathered headdress wereing Goddess of Egypt that's that's plenty of them to get the picture there was a lot of gods in Egypt these are some of the major major gods and and you realize that this uh nation of Israel this is what they lived in on a day basis the children that came out of Israel they were born in the nation of Egypt that worshiped these Gods when they went and they played with their little friends in the street these gods were on building they were on the houses they were lifted up they they were great statues and things of them built so you see when they come out of this all these great statues and things that were built to these Gods but let me ask you this who do you think built all those statues of these Gods it wasn't the Egyptian princes that built them it was the Hebrew slaves so here God knew this one thing that the hands of his children had built every God the hands of the children of God had built their feet they had built the legs of them they had built these palaces to worship them it was the hands of the children of Israel that built the statues it was the hands of the children of Israel that built the places of worship and you realize that even though they had labored over them let me tell you something friends they put their work into it they put their sweat into it and they labored over them and they built them for Egypt and they built these great Gods but you realize of all the labor that they done for them that those Gods never done one thing for the children of Israel they never done one thing for God's children I thought my but see God had a prophecy he said in 400 years you'll live in a Land of bondage but at the end of 400 years I'm going to bring you out and let me tell you when God went to keep his word after 400 years of them living in this place of God or or or or a place of bondage when it came time for God to move David Paul there wasn't a single Pharaoh there wasn't no Army of pharaoh there was no God of Egypt there wasn't 1,500 deities that could stop Jehovah God from fulfilling his word you me tell you what that means it means it turns out that Oh Glory I feel like preaching on it turns out that benu had no power over the son after all but let me tell you my god did when he took Joshua down there that day when he was in the middle of a battle and through the voice of a of a man of God he told the son to stand still that he could finish his battle it turns out that they had no power over the sea like God did when Moses went down to the Red Sea and the waters would stop them but he stretched his dried out over the sea and the waters parted and the children of Israel went across dry Tri it turns out they had no power over the Earth like God did when he sent a Prophet by the name of Elijah and told the Earth that it couldn't bring forth seed any longer and a famine would come on the land it turned out they had no power over the rain and the power over the heavens like God did when he called his Prophet to speak to the heavens and call Rain upon the Earth again sir it turns out they had no power after all you think about it they had no power over anything they had no they had no power over the animals oh friends I could preach this morning if you let me they had no power over the animals like God did when Abraham took his own son Isaac up on a mountain to lay him on a rock to sacrifice him and the Bible said when he laid him up there he said the lord giveth and the lord taketh away I'll I'll do what God has told me to do and the Bible says but then there was a ram that was caught in the thicket the sacrifice that repl replace the life of his own son let me tell you friends it wasn't nemu the ram God that supplied a ram for Abraham but it was Jehovah God that put a ram in a Thicket let me tell you because he's Jehovah he's the god of creation he's the god of the son he's the god of the heaven he's the god of the sea he's the god of the earth he's the god of the water he's the god of the foul he's the god of every creeping thing he's the god of the beasts of the land and he put a ram in a Thicket let me tell you this friends the gods of Egypt were no match for Jehovah God I feel like having church I can't help it they were no match for Jehovah God let me tell SOC the crocodile God he couldn't even destroy Moses when he was a baby laying in a basket floating down the river and aisle I said the gods of Egypt were no match for the god Jehovah God he's the god you say well why couldn't they do it because they were gods that were created by the imagination of men and I got some news for you this morning that every God God that is made out of the imagination of men will perish with the men that imagine them they'll have no place well let me tell you that's what happened when the flood came the Bible says the flood came you know what it destroyed the Bible says man's imagination was on evil continually the thoughts of man they had built up many gods and idols and things that men worship they refused to worship God like Noah and his family did but when the flood Came Upon the Earth it took every man every imagination every God that they had ever built up in every house in every land in every Temple and it destroyed it off the face of the Earth they have no power over Jehovah God I'm so thankful this morning brother Wesley I'm thankful that we don't have to have a different God for everything we have need of right I'm thankful I don't have to have a God for the sun and a God for the moon and a God for the stars and a god it may mean more to you if you ever went to India one time but but God I I can I just tell it I I was over there in in one of the trips that I had gone on in the great uh hurricane it was a hurricane pile and you can look it up when you get home but this hurricane it was a class 4 hurricane and to take over the whole entire east coast of India they evacuated I believe it was 1.2 million people the newspaper said I've got the article at home if you ever want to see it but they evacuated people but more importantly I was in the evacuation so there when they were evacuating everybody out of the city cuz this hurricane was coming to destroy the coast of India I have a photo on my on my tablet of of the hurricane as it was as it had to uh uh showed that that vag the city we were in was in the middle of where this storm was coming there there was no way around it and people were evacuated off the coast and move to other places so we I couldn't get on evacuation bus and be stranded out in the middle of India so I went to the hotel and we had people praying and we knelt down we started praying that the Lord would help us I said I don't believe God sent me here to Die the brother said brother what are you going to do I said I'm going to go to bed because I don't believe this Trip's over I don't believe God sent me here to die I I don't have nowhere else I can go there's no refuge for me in a in a camp in India somewhere but God supplied me a room and I'm going to the room and I'm going to rest and tomorrow we can continue on with the meeting we got up the next day in the newspaper article I've got it in my in in my office but the newspaper article it said the city of Destiny had another miraculous escape the hurricane that was coming to vac it turned and went up the coast and it said not even a single drop of rain fell in the city of Isaac oh friends let me tell you what happened when I went outside that morning the beaches were full of worshippers that were putting flowers out in the water and worshiping some goddess and some another God and some the god of the rain and some the god of hurricane I stood behind them and these brothers that were with me I thought my if their eyes could only be open for just a minute to realize it wasn't this goddess but it was Jehovah God he's the Creator he made the storm and he made the peace he made the sea he made the winds and the rain he's the god over all of it and he delivered us that day well guess what we went on and had a meeting I'm so thankful we baptized hundreds of people in those meetings because God had made a way you realize that God let a storm come just to have a testimony to use to build the meeting that's how God works he's the god over all of it I feel like I feel good this morning I'm thankful I don't have to have a different God can you imagine if you had to have a different God you got into some marriage troupel and you had to go around looking for the counselor God where where did I put the counselor here here we are in a mess I don't know where I put the counselor babe did you put it somewhere where is it can you look in your purse see if you can find the counselor because we're in trouble I don't have to have a different God when you get behind on your bills somebody help me I somebody find the prosperity God we're in trouble I don't know where to find him and and now I'm behind on my bill I don't know how I'm going to pay it when you get sick somebody find the Healer I don't know where I put the Healer when you when you have a when when the doctor says you can't have a baby somebody find the god of fertility that it'll friends it ain't got nothing to do with it there's one God his name is Jehovah and he can do it all you say how do you know because he is not an image that was created by the imaginations of man but he is a living reality that created man that's our god Jehovah God let me tell you what the Bible says we're not to make an image of him we're not to make an image but we're to be made in His image that's what the Bible said he didn't tell tell us to go make an image he said I made you in my image but say some some says if you pack an image of Christ in your car on your wall that it's a sign of a Christian said well them things are all right but I don't believe that packing an image makes you a Christian I believe that being an image of Christ is what makes you a Christian it's not what we do outwardly it's what happened inwardly that makes us what we are therefore if he is our image and we are in his likeness and we're members of his body we should be images like him then our lives should reflect the image of Christ not in our joining church or in our packing a crucifix or our emotions but it should be in the living presence of the Living God that's reflected through our life how many say Amen to that he say see church membership is all right I have nothing against it or any of those things but brother to be a Christian means to be conformed to the image of Christ we want to be the living images not pack an image but to be an image of the Lord Jesus Oh My it makes me feel good this morning we're to be an image of the Lord Jesus see if we're to reflect his image then what is his image I tell you what the Bible says here's what Paul said he said speaking of Christ in Colossians he said he is the image of the invisible God where to reflect Christ's image Paul said Christ was the image of the invisible God and the firstborn of every creature so if you're to reflect the image of Christ and Christ is the image of God think about what you're really supposed to be reflecting that's a tall task isn't it to reflect the image of God in this world but don't dismiss it that's what the Bible says you say I how could I reflect the image of a Creator how could I reflect the image of of almighty God how it's so easy to dismiss because we look at this flesh and how weak that we are and how could we ever reflect a deity in such a way as this but don't don't dismiss it because the Bible said that in Genesis the first chapter God said and God said let us make man in our image this was God's intention all along after our likeness and let him have dominion over the fish of the Sea and the foul of the air over the cattle over all the Earth over every creeping thing that creepeth upon the Earth so God created man in his own image and in the image of God created he him male and female created he them see so when God made men brother the Jared he made them in his own image and he gave them Dominion so people say well man was made in the image of God so that gives man dominion over everything now that ain't what God Said didn't give him dominion over everything because because there's some you don't have dominion over Paul would say that was an exception you say see because you have dominion over everything except for the god that created you let me just show you what God's saying see Paul Paul goes on and he tells us he tells you what part of this image that you are in Colossians he says for by Christ were all things created that are in heaven in Earth visible invisible whether they be Thrones or dominions or principalities or Powers all things were created by Him and for him and he is before all things and by him all things consist and he speaking of Christ he is the head of the body the church so Christ is the head and the church was the body said see so he he didn't ever Place us as the head the church is the body so here God would make you in His image but it was never to be have dominion over God say see so he is the the head of the body which is the church who is the beginning firstborn from the dead that in all things he might have preeminence so here here's the here's the head of the body here's the the even though we were made in His image we were not made to replace God we were not made to be above God we were not made to be established and and and and Paul said for it pleased the father that in him should all the fullness dwell so the headship was given to Christ and the church the body under the headship of Christ would have authority over all things have dominion over the Earth and have dominion over sickness and have dominion over the Flesh and have dominion over death and hell and the grave and the and the devil he would have dominion under the headship of Jesus Christ see the Bible says you're made in the image of God but not that you would ever have authority over God let me let me tell you friends this morning that it don't matter how great you ever build a man that man will never have authority over God it doesn't matter how many men there are you can get a group of them together of Great Men and you can bind them together but they'll never have authority over God you can make a great nation you can get great armies you can make great coalitions but they'll never be above God God will never allow any man or any man-made thing to Tower above him or to replace him or to have dominion over him or to take preeminence over him God will never allow it see man tried that one time I know this may this may be a lot but man tried that that one time in the Book of Genesis in the 11th chapter remember when they went out after the flood they said I'll tell you what we'll do we'll just bind together and we'll make a tower that reaches up into the heavens and then if there if God ever comes and he floods the Earth again we won't have to worry about it because we'll just go up in the tower and everything will be saved we'll we'll just get we'll just we'll just achieve greatness and and you know what here whenever God saw them that he said they would do great things they would do things that that they they they should not be able to do and so here God would separate them by their own language and stop them from being able to do it remember when they built the Tower the Bible says God came he's divided their language they that they couldn't communicate any longer and they couldn't finish the task they could no longer work together and bind together to do this thing why because they were trying to take the place of God they were building something that would that would replace God isn't that something that all the way through the Bible through thousands of years of of of all history of of humanity there's always a people that are trying to replace God oh it don't matter if 6,000 years ago and today there's people that try to replace God they replac him with other men they'll replac him with churches they'll replac him with Idols they'll replac him with with with beliefs or denominations or great things and you see this great this great uh Tower of bab that was been built but butam said but see God has got enough of it he said he's had enough of this scientific Moon shooting missile dropping age that we're in it ain't nothing but another Tower of Babel and don't you know that God will destroy this Earth because he said he would he said that's the reason I'm out here tonight that's the reason I'm trying to press forward to get every soul that I can because the longsuffering of God in the days of Noah is the same as it is now he's not willing that any should perish and God sent every kind of a gift that he could before the people and still they stay outside of the Kingdom you say what causes it why does so many struggle entering in and why why why do they struggle with with the move of God and why do they struggle with the supernatural here here God would send Great Signs to the church to turn the hearts of the people away from the things that men had built up and back to God he said it's because much of it it comes from the pull pits that's being preached he said we know that when they get out they preach the denial of the days of Miracles and the denial of the Holy Ghost and so forth that's what brings that they deny the Supernatural and they deny what God's anointing they deny the things that God does they deny healing but friends we ain't coming to deny it this morning we're coming to invite it I don't deny the word I want to invite the word I don't deny the supernatural I I how many would join with me this morning I didn't come to deny the promise of God I come to invite it into my life I didn't deny the power of God but I want to invited it in my church we didn't come to deny it we came to invite it but you realize you realize what that Tower of bible really was see many put it in history whether it was just some that they built but it wasn't it was it was that they came together in such a way that they were building something together in such a way that they would be greater in God and friends I got news for you it wasn't left in history can I read you a modern day version of it this is in Revelation the 13th chapter you'll see the modern day version of the Tower of Babel the Bible says I stood on the sand of the sea and I saw a beast rise up out of the sea having seven heads and 10 horns and upon his horns 10 crowns and upon the heads the name of blasphemy and there was given unto him a mouth speaking great things and blasphemies blasphemies and he opened his mouth in blasphemy against God to blaspheme his name and his Tabernacle and them that dwell in heaven and it was given unto him to make war with the Saints to overcome them and power was given him over all kindreds and tongues and Nations and all that dwell upon the Earth shall worship Him whose names are not written in the book of Li the lamb slain before the foundation of the world here bam says see what was he said see he this these blasphemies that are spoken anybody whose name was not written in that book they would all go worship Him you see the great Coalition or or the or The Binding Together of people and as long isn't it isn't it the way it is as long as we get enough people to agree with us then we then we can be right as long as we get enough people on board you know that's the way our that's the way our world is that's the way the the government is and Society well as long as enough people vote for it then it must be right that's how they judge whether things are right or wrong you get a bunch of ungodly men and women and a bunch of people that ain't filled with the Holy Ghost and you get them all together and you let them think with whatever nasty worldly thoughts they can and they can put that filthy mind to work and they can make a vote and that must be right because they all thought the same thing let me tell you friends you can take 10 billion flies and put them in a room and tell you to eat garbage but it's still going to taste like garbage it don't matter how many of them's on the garbage pile or on the Heap I think we ought to turn to the word of God this morning and forget what the world's trying to sell you and look to God's word and take the way with the Lord despise few they would all worship him if their names wasn't in the book but said don't you remember how Nimrod that hypocrite built this big tower he made all other cities pay tribute to it Babel is the same thing it just changes its name as it comes up it's Rome now it's Babylon and the whole world is brought to Babylon you realize what the world has done today I know you you may not study this stuff but you ever review the the Great coun the church councils the World Council of churches people bow down to it and they they'll take brother bam said whenever they join that they'll take on the mark of the beast and not even know it because what are they doing let's just draw all the denominations together let's all come under one headship and let's all just come let's all just make peace and just well well we we ain't trying to fight with them but I ain't going to eat their nonsense either say so let's just bind together let's said they take on the mark of the beast and not even know it he says see how contrary is denomination to God's word he never had one he never dealt in one he never dealt with one but those who are elected will hear the word and they'll come out of it we'll build up a great image we'll build up something great that'll draw people we'll build up some some man-made Theology and it'll draw people and we'll make we'll make some way that they can come isn't it something how the churches are well I'll tell you what we'll do you want to see the greatest moving churches in the world today the fastest growing churches in the world it's a church that has a Pentecostal that has a Pentecostal style or has that kind of music but they but they don't have any Holiness you want to see a fast moving the these churches out there in the world it's because they get in there and they and they'll they they love they love mimicking what the Holy Ghost is but they have but but they have no Holiness they take out that well you can come and you can be any my goodness I'm going to get myself in trouble but you can be a Christian you you can look like the world the women they cut their hair all off and they they they they run around half naked and and men and lusting after them and they're filth and the men turned into a bunch of sissies and there ain't nobody knows their place anymore a man that can't be a man and a woman can't be a a woman you can walk down the street and half the time you can't even tell them apart and somehow people have said that that's the normal let me tell you friends the only normal thing there is is Jesus Christ the only normal thing there is is the word of God you can't go to a denomination and find [Applause] it I know people try to make room for everybody but that ain't what we were called to do I ain't trying to be mean I'm just trying to be straight this morning we weren't called to do don't tell your children we're just going down there and fellowship with everybody else and just get all wrapped up and all that and it'll be okay they'll destroy your children they'll plant seeds they'll build images in their mind build up thoughts in their mind that they grow up well it ain't so bad after all cuz they do it nothing bad ever happens to them but they fail to recognize a living God it's contrary to the word of God said God never dealt one he never had one never dealt in one never dealt with one hello somebody wake up he never dealt with one he never dealt in one never had one but those who are electable hear the word of God and they'll come out of it you think of this age it's the age that's leosa that we're in blind and miserable and naked and don't even know it brother said that's what this church has constantly done Through the Ages she's left the word of God and taken her own Creeds she organized and joined herself to the world that she is naked and God is judging her lewdness the only way she can get out of this dread situation is obeying the Lord and coming back to his word that's what Revelations 18 said come out of her my people 2 Corinthians 6 he said be ye not unequally yolked together with unbelievers for what Fellowship hath righteous with unrighteousness what communion hath light with Darkness what corn uh Concord hath Christ with bow or what part ha he that believeth with an Infidel and what agreement hath the temple of God with idols that's the Bible but said for you are the Temple of the Living God as God has said I will dwell in them I will walk in them I will be their God and they shall be my people so come out from among them and be ye separate sayeth the Lord touch not the unclean thing and I will receive you and I will be a father unto you and you shall be my sons and daughters sayeth the Lord God Almighty see it's been built up as a big image of Christianity but you realize that no image will ever stand before the word of God no matter how beautiful it is it'll never stand in the place of God you know in the Old Testament I I'm I'm wrapping up here but in the Old Testament there was there was a great I'm starting to wrap up can I put it that way there was a great God in the Old Testament you know the uh the the the greatest two gods that were known in the Old Testament was Baal and deeon you studied the scripture they were the the the great many followers of millions of people deeon being the god of the Philistines remember whenever whenever Goliath went down into the field and he fought against David this was the gods that he called upon the Bible says he called upon his own Gods that he would come and deliver him and I thought isn't it something that he would call upon his gods and and here here little David would stand there he said how dare you defy the armies of the Living God while you're ain't nothing but an uncircumcised Philistine but the gods of of the Philistines were no match for the God for the god of of David and so you see as this this great Deon this great God deeon was a great fish God and he was he was known throughout all the lands of the Philistines he was the greatest of their gods but in the Bible there that you can find two stories that that really that really talk about this God and the the greatness that he was and and and and you see that that that how how much that he meant to those people and so you'll find that one day that there was a man by the name of Samson and know y'all know the story of Samson and how that Samson he had he had he had a vow with God and he had broken The Vow with God and remember he had laid in the lap of the Li and entertain these things and because of it he he had lost his strength and he had broken his vow and so the Bible says that they took Samson and they placed him in a temple and they and you realize that the temple they placed him in was the Temple of deeon it was their place of worship so they brought Samson and they placed him here and and they they brought him in there to make fun of him and mock him and here Samson was a great man of God he was a man that that was that was a that was so uh ordained of God and he had great strength and he had been such a he had been such a a a Warrior against the Philistines and and the and and and all the the Wrath that they had and so but whenever they took him and they brought him to this place this place of worship the Bible said like this it said the Lords of the Philistines gathered them together to offer a great sacrifice unto Deon their God and to Rejoice isn't it something that Samson the servant of God the man of God that they would bring him to dayone to offer as a sacrifice they were they were going to make sacri sacrifices to their God and and make sport of Samson and so because they had taken him they brought him before their God and to rejoice and they said our God ha delivered Samson our enemy into our hand and when the people saw him they praised their God and they said our God had delivered into our hands our enemy and the destroyer of our country which slew many of us and it came to pass when their hearts were merry they said call for Samson that he may come and let us make sport and they called Samson out of the prison house and he made them Sport and they set him between the pillars and Samson said unto unto the lad that led him Hand by hand he said suffer me that I may feel the pillars where this house stands that I may lean upon them see you realize this house it was filled with 3,000 Philistines that had gathered in this place here to come to worship this great God Deon for the victory that deeon had brought them over Samson the servant of God but said what a sad sight it was he said here you think of this this this picture of what was taking place it must have been a hot afternoon whenever here sson would come walking in the sun was shining down on this great Cathedral this celebration and these Philistines would look down from the galleries as the as Samson and this young lad would enter in here here here he's leading him like a dog into this place and here these high honored men of the Philistines that were that were coming to worship their great God he said what a sad sight to see them as they as they looked and leaned forward to get a good look at the boy that led the blind man and the Halls Echo with drunken rry and celebrating he said here's what hurts me is they were C celebrating the victory of their fish God Deon over Jehovah's servant this is what hurts is that they were celebrating the that this Idol that they were celebrating that they were worshiping saying that he had given them victory over a servant of God you realize that's what Satan's looking to do he's looking to have a celebration of a victory over the idol that has that has taken over every servant of God he said but you realize what a disgrace it was what a thing had happened the man had failed it wasn't God That Failed but his servant had failed and Jehovah he must have been thinking as he looked down to see all that was going on drunken conglomeration of women here they were half stripped down and fine jeweled and decorated and all fixed up watching this take place and in their their drunken husbands all drinking and celebrating to a god a fish God an idol that had took victory over Jehovah's servant what a sad sight it is to see an idol take victory over Jehovah's servant what a sad sight it is that a that an image would take victory over Jehovah's servant something that has been built up that that was built up by man that would take victory over a servant of Jehovah God you see you could imagine if God as God would look down on his servant that had been defeated the one that he had made a vow with here was a servant of the Lord and God he had made a promise to God and God had made a promise to him and for many years he kept the promise and and and he he done to be obedient to the Lord but he had failed and this great image that he had built up in his mind it was something may been something from days gone by and Years Gone by well it ain't you ain't going to go you can't go back to it but it was a great image that had taken victory over him people worshiping an idol for the victory that had given them and God watched the whole thing can you imagine God that made him God that gave you the power God that gave him the vow God that gave him the strength to be able to lead to be able to lead the the children of Israel as a judge against the Philistines he was a man of great strength that one day that he went down and slew a thousand with a Jawbone one day when they took him and they they put him in a city the Bible says he just took the gates of the city and ripped him up and carried him out of the way they couldn't they couldn't lock him up anywhere but he allowed something to come into his life and now they were worshiping a god an imaginated God a god of imagination that had taken victory over Samson I thought my can you imagine God sitting there and looking at this situation you know I I I think of it this way I think God if God ever sat on the edge of his seat he was sitting on the edge of his seat that day God was waiting for his servant to turn around he was waiting for him God being an eternal God and no doubt knowing how things would turn out but God was just waiting on the word of Samson to say Lord could you restore me one more time he's a God who is rich in Mercy he's the god of restoration he's the god that can take something that's broken he can put it back together again this is the god that that that had time in this condition and and God don't you think about God watching him God don't enjoy watching you struggle God don't enjoy watching you fail he don't enjoy watching you be made spoiled of by the devil he don't enjoy watching you be made fun of and poked out and blindness coming upon your life God don't enjoy watching his servy in that condition and God waited until fin finally here Samson stood in that place and something came and moving around him I think it was an angel of the Lord that went down to where he was and begin to minister to him that that it ain't over yet there's still breath in your body there's still a little bit of life if you'll call upon the name of the Lord he is just a hear you he'll forgive you he'll come and help you right now and Samson begin to cry out to God he called to the Lord Bible say he said Lord remember me I pray strengthen me just this once oh God that I may be Avenged of the Philistines from our two eyes and he took a hold of the two pillars upon the house where it stood and the one that was born up with his right and his left hand and Samson said Lord let me die with the Philistines and he bowed himself with all of his might and the house fell upon the Lord's and upon the people that were therein so the Deb which he slew at his death was more than he ever slew in his life see what looked like it would be a great defeat became his greatest Victory what looked like it' be greatest struggle it became his greatest Victory you say what brought the victory it's because he turned to the Lord oh my can you imagine hey they took out his eyes they didn't take out his ears can you imagine Samson sitting there and hearing the commotion of them going on and knowing his relationship with God and the things that he had seen God do and now he was hearing them sit and worship this son God or this this fish God de gon and oh de gon the great how you brought Sanson they gone the great how you brought victory over him they gone I imagine sanson's whole mind when he heard it went back to everything he had ever done or said that was wrong and say oh God how'd I ever get myself into that condition if I could go back and talk to me I'd talk me out of it I'd say Samson turn around and follow the word of the Lord and Lead this thing and let God be your lead let him be your guide the Bible says he slew them 3,000 fell that day even when the men you think about it even when men fall the word of God remains true even when men fall but Jesus said Heaven and Earth will pass away but my word shall never pass away men will fall but the word will never fall listen what Samson prayed for he prayed for a restoration of The Vow that he had with God it was the it was it was the it was the very thing that he had made you realize that this vow this vow was a covenant that God had made with him how many knows what what a Nazarite vow was a Nazarite vow a Nazarite is one that is consecrated for a purpose and here's what brother bam said he said see Samson was consecrated to an age and to a purpose so therefore he let his hair grow out long remember when he finally told the lia the secret he had that long curly hair hanging down them locks kind probably looked like Xavier over there had that hair just along long and hanging around but he but he had them locks hanging but it was it was the Nazarite bow that God had made with him and finally when he told Delilah The Secret of it that she took the scissors and cut it off and he lost his vow with God and remember said see every child of Abraham is a Nazarite with a vow from God swore by himself so it ain't just Samson it's every one of us that are Abraham's seed so if you're how means Abraham's seed if you're Abraham's seed then you have a vow with God and if you have a vow with God then you've been consecrated for a purpose you say well what's the purpose it was to take the Covenant which is the word of God it was it was to separate oursel from the world it's the Covenant that God has made with us therefore it may not be the very same thing as Samson in the Old Testament but God has given us an order of how we look we don't we don't look like the world that's when you look at the church today the church don't look like the world it don't dress like the world it don't act like the world let me tell you friends what we were made to do was proved to the world that that that that the life that you live that there is a race of people that can overcome the pressures of the age that we live in you're made to prove to the world that there's a super race I'm not talking about the color of a person's skin I'm talking about the race that Peter was talking about he he said you're a chosen generation a royal priesthood a holy Nation A peculiar people that you should show forth the Praises of him that has called you out of Darkness into this Marvelous Light in times past you were not a people but you're now the people of God there was a time when you hadn't obtained Mercy but now you have obtained Mercy You're A peculiar people that's been called out of the world but let me tell you friends even greater than that not only were you called out of the world Cody but the world has been called out of you God called it out of you it wasn't to remain in you when he called you out of world he called the world out of you do you realize that the very thing that had power over you has been called out it don't matter what it is whenever you were in this world the demon of lust has been called out of you the the the the demon of adultery has been called out of you the spirit the spirit that that would cause a man to lie and cheat and steal it's been called out of you that demon of suicide it was called out of you the demon of depression it's been called out of you you wasn't just called out of the world but the world has been called out of you many are Waring today there there's a great battle that is going on within there's a great struggle can I finish just here I'm about to close a great struggle you think of this all this this shaking that is going on in the in the life of a human being if you could if you could see friends you'd have a lot more grace on people if you could look into the into the heart of a man see what he's struggling with and the things that that are in his life that he didn't put there you know May came from history or may have been handed down from from Generations it may be it was outside influences and things but all these things that are in our lives and so you have a little bit of Grace for people because you realize they're war and there's a great battle a lot of things that are that are quaking within us they struggle say what's this struggle All About You think because in this struggle there have been great gods that have been built up in them men have done so many things they built images in our mind that become Gods to us great things they take men and they make God out of them they take churches and they make Gods out of them they take they take pastors and make Gods out of them and when they build up and then when the men fall then the people are left without when the church falls the people are left scattered when the when the men go they're left scattered because they put up an image between them and God but do you realize that God called that there would be nothing between you and him there' be there's no man that's between you and God except Jesus Christ who is God he he he was made he made a way that every person person that every believer that every one of us that we would have access to God we don't have to go to a priest and confess our sins and and confess our faults in some confession booth and ask for somebody to pay away that you can have access to God and you can take the poorest woman in the church and she can kneel down in her bedroom closet and the same God that would come down in the in the house of God will meet her right in her prayer closet you don't have to be some great man or great wealth to meet with God say see he he there there they built up these images but just because you think about it just because it was formed in the image of a God don't mean that it has the power of God many images have been built up people are living under the power you think of this I want you to catch this this morning people live under the power of an image that they have built by their own imagination they're living under a struggle that's been built by imagination you think about what happens any of you that's recently gave your heart to the Lord and some of you been a long time you may still remember it but you remember when you when you first come and and every you want to give everything to the Lord you begin to make things right and you go home and you go home at night you know what the devil does how many testify of this but whenever he comes by he'll say but you can't ever live that anyway how many testify to that am I the only person devil ever y'all raise your hand High everybody thank you you know why cuz he does it to everybody so whenever you get alone and say well you couldn't ever be a Christian anyway after all what you did was way worse than what anybody else ever did you know matter of fact you know God May forgive you but the people won't ever I don't know how you can go Fellowship there because they know you they know everything you done you can't hide that they'll all they're always that's always going to be there this is the devil talking to build up an image that come from the imagination of of men think of this sitting there in in our own imagination you'll build a reason why you can't go to church and in your own imagination you'll build a reason why you can't serve God in your own imagination you'll build a reason why why you're not the bride and why you can't go in a Rapture and why you can't believe the message in your own imagination you'll build a something that'll stop you from being able to serve the Lord this is the Great War struggle that's going on see you realize that they're living under this power these images that they've allowed to be built up many things get between you and God many great things that we build up we make Gods out of them butam said you can make somebody a God you can make anything a God you can build anything up to be your God to be what you serve it could be jobs houses it could be cars it could be people it could be Idols it could be things it could be thoughts it don't matter what it is it can become a God it'll take your time the time that you should devote to the Lord it'll rob you of all your time it'll rob you of all the all the the the the devotion it'll rob you it'll rob you of being able to worship God and you realize that these things has been built up but they they become Gods but see there's a difference between what a God is and what God is can I just finish with this see the Bible tells us in John the first chapter in the beginning was the word and the Word was with God and the Word was God and the Word was made flesh and dwelt among us and we beheld him the only gotten father full of grace but in the Old Testament when you read that in the beginning God it uses a different word you ever notice that in the Old Testament we preached a whole series on on the word Elohim in the Old Testament it was in the beginning Elohim see Elohim means the self-existing one and there's a great difference between the word Elohim and the word that we use for God see our God means an object of worship but Elohim means a self-existing one so anybody can take something and make a God out of it but brother said but notice that difference but in the beginning there was God the self-existing one he says so you can make a God out of anything but it can never be self-existent you could worship that piano but the piano can't create itself that you could worship the uh this pull pit but the pull pit is not self-existent you could worship another man but the man is not self-existent it had to be created by something but Elohim the Bible said but in the beginning Elohim that's our God in the beginning Elohim the self-existing one the only thing that there ever was that never had a Creator the only thing that ever was that is beyond our understanding with this created human mind that we have the self-existing one he said we can't be self-existing we can't be Almighty we can't be omnipotent or omnipresent or omnicient Elohim expresses all of that we cannot be that the tree that you make a God out of or the building you make a God out of it is not self-existing so whenever God created in the beginning the Bible said in the beginning Elohim created the Heaven and the Earth he said what when the attribute of Elohim you think about it when the attribute of Elohim which was called the Holy Ghost the person of Jesus Christ see these are attributes of God Father and Son and Holy Ghost it's the attributes of God and when that attribute called the Holy Ghost the attribute called the person of Jesus Christ the word of God Finds Its place in the soul of a man it'll shatter every image of any God that you have ever built up let me tell you Friends when the word of God comes into a temple it'll Shadow the it'll Shadow the image of any God that's been built oh there was there was a time as the music players get ready there was a time in the Old Testament the Bible said that Israel had gone down into battle and because of her condition she had fallen in battle you remember this when she fell in battle the Philistines heard that there was a great there was a great Roar in the camp of the Israelites and the philistin said well what's going on they said well the Ark of the Lord has came onto the battlefield and fear struck the Philistines and and when fear struck them they they begin to cry out well we we can't do nothing now this is the gods listen how they said it God's plural because that's the only thing they knew this is the gods that delivered them out of Egypt this is the gods that brought them over the Red Sea this is the gods that has slain every city before them and finally some Philistines stood up he said well they ain't but they fell before us it ain't going to stop them now let's go destroy them anyhow and they got up enough courage that they went down in the battlefield Samson was a young man a young Prophet at the time or Samuel but you know when they went in the battlefield guess what happened they slew the Israelites they destroyed them everyone that stayed in battle they lost their life or fled from it and the Philistines they got they got them a trophy they took a looked around and said my it wasn't that great after all Bible says they picked up these Great Men of the Philistines they picked up that great Ark of the Covenant that was built the same one that walked across the Red Sea and that Phil army they lifted it above their heads they went back into town in ashod and said we've had victory over the gods of Israel you know what they did Brother David they took that they took that that that Arc of the Covenant and they took the those Commandments of God which was the top of the word and they took that Ark and they took it down into the Temple of deeon and they set it down in there you know where they put it they put it right by the great image of the great fish God d gone the Bible said they come in they're they're going to have a good worship over it they went to having a party and they took the they took the Ark of God and they laid it in there and set it by day gone and when the when the men of ashot arose early in the next morning the Bible says they went down into the temple and deeon was falling on his face before the Ark of the Lord and you know what the men did they took Deon Glory they took Deon and they set him back up again they I don't know what happened happened to our God I thought isn't it something that the Bible said he was laying on his face before the Ark of the Lord so they set him back up and said well I don't know what's going on here they set him back up they went back next day the Bible said they rose up early in the morning and deeon was falling on his face to the ground before the ark and the head of deeon and both of his palms of his hands were cut off and the only thing left was a stump the Ark of the Lord entered into the temple right and the image of Deon fell you know you can only prop it up so glory to God I done I'm I'm already out of time but you can only prop it up so long before God will just take it down to nothing you can you can take an image that's been built up when the word of the Lord enters into a temple it don't matter what the image was it's going to fall and you can prop it up today you can come back tomorrow and you can prop it back up and God can knock it down you can come back next week and you can go right back into the same thing and you can pop it up and God will knock it down but one morning you'll come in and you'll find it with its head cut off and it won't have the hands to hold on to you any longer and it'll be nothing but a stum in a memory of a image a shattered image that remains in your life when the go word of God enters in it'll make his way every image will fall you think when the true word of God comes in contact with some man-made image it don't matter what it is the word of God will always Prevail won't you stand to your feet this morning it'll Prevail you realize you say how was it Prevail because it's the life that is in the word that prevails over all things and the life that see our God is not a dead God it's a living God so the word that's entering into you it ain't some dead thing it's a living thing if you could ever catch the revelation of it it's something that is moving on the inside of you it's a spirit it's not just an imagination and this spirit that is dealing with things in your life it's cutting them away and it's shattering every image that you built up every image of legalism it gets cut out every every image of following after men it gets cut out every image of a denomination is cut out every image of sin and spirits and demons it gets cut out because it can't stand before the word of God says see that what it is it's the life of God and that life becomes a token unto you that whenever that image raises up don't think you don't raise up his ugly head I know some of you sitting here this morning maybe you I mean barely even come to church some people they barely they're barely even here I'm glad you're here it's a good place to start but there's more to it than just coming to church you these things that's been built up in our lives there comes a time when you say enough's enough and I'm not going to let this thing destroy me enough enough I built it up as a great image that I'll never be able to overcome it and it's just a part of my nature and I can't get past it but it comes a time when enough is enough and enough word will come in you see why it's important to go to church it's important to hear the word of God it's important to listen to the message when enough word gets in there the enemy can't have no place that life and then when he raises up his ugly head You' got a token something that you can display over him and say behold it the life that was in the word that was in the blood it paid the sacrifice was made and it's over you and you can hold it over him brother B said see the life that life he said we identify ourselves in his death burial and Resurrection by Believing on him and being baptized unto his death burial and resurrection and and when we rise up the holy spirit is there to give us a token an eternal token written across your heart make up the Mind Body Spirit everything else that you are you're separated person from unbelief you're a separated person from the things of the world you're a separated person from Death you're a separated from everything and you are a product that God has sealed into the kingdom by his Holy Spirit and there ain't no devil and no sickness no death no sorrow there's nothing that can ever bother you as long as you hold that to broken over it friend there's a God that you can hold over every image that could ever be built up there's a God that you can hold over every sickness there's a God you can hold over every failure every problem every Spirit that's unlike God if you could get a hold of him this morning there's a God that you could that you could hold over and today it be the last day that you ever had that image raised up in your life he said your unchanging faith pulsates it and it forms it your faith forms it what is this God that's entered into you he said your faith forms it a form of Jesus Christ the image that you're walking in today take a hold of the faith of the word of God and let the image of God be formed in you amen you believe that this morning won't you just bow your heads I didn't mean to scream at you I felt like preaching I know some of you glad to come to church this morning but you know why I struggle to come to church cuz you have images built up things that get built up and it becomes the greatest problem and the joy of coming to church and serving the lord it goes by the wayside CU all these things has been built up in our life and taking the place of God maybe be sicknesses it may be something in your body maybe whatever it is that would cause us something to be built up but I believe that we have a god this morning that can enter in and that can shatter every image maybe you have a need this morning you say brother Matt I pray you'd remember me you know what you're going through something that's been built up in your life and God sees those hands God bless you brother sister things that has been built up you didn't maybe you didn't put them there maybe somebody else built them up there but they've been built up in your life but there come a time say Well when is that going to be what about now I can't think of a better day to tear down an image think they can a better day to to shatter any Spirit young man God bless you little boys ain't never done nothing wrong in their life but want something from the Lord this morning God sees you he knows your heart many hands raised some aren't raised need to be raised we got to real realiz that it's been built up this image of Christianity you spent years under under men and built an image of what a real Christian really is and it ain't got nothing to do with it nature is a hard nature and harsh to one another and bitter and that's not that's not the the nature of Jesus Christ friends I don't believe that that you can be filled with the Holy Ghost and that it don't have the power to take that old nature out of you I believe it does I believe that the things that you carry and the things that was put in your life I believe that the Holy Ghost has the power to change a person's nature you know why cuz I've seen too many people that their nature was changed I believe he has the power to do it if you have the if you'll if you'll receive it this morning say Lord I pray You' help my nature God bless every one of you this morning I lift my hands to the Lord Lord Jesus God I ask you Lord God as you see the hands that was raised this morning knowing that that Lord how Satan would build up such great things Lord that would get in the way of the things that you called us to do and Lord I know many times that the images that Satan builds they seem much greater and they may be great beautiful things but Lord what we really want is you and Lord we want to serve you Lord we want to we want to fulfill your word and be real Believers and Christians and Sons and Daughters of God lord I ask you this morning Lord according to the word that was spoken Lord what you put on my heart to speak Lord I pray God that you would move

be able to overcome it Lord even when he wants free of it and can't even get away from it or escaping and Lord It's Str such a struggle and a battle and causes problems in their Mar marriage and in their home and but God there ain't no image that you can't destroy Lord I realize that it come from the imagination of men Lord that Satan would build it up at something that was greater than the than the word of God but Lord I ask you this morning that you would tear it down God may we be sincere enough Lord to be able to receive from you this morning God may you break down everything that is unlike you Lord that your people be a free people Lord let them walk away from this place Lord being free from every everything that Satan would build build up in our lives Lord would we go away Lord
