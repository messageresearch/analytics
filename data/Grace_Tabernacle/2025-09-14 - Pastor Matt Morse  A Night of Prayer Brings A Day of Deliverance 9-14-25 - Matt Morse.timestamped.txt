[36:29] through. I my troules tonight.
[36:32] One more battle with the devil that I
[36:35] know he'll understand.
[36:37] Oh, I'm going through with Jesus.
[36:39] Hallelujah. Holy Ghost garden.
[36:44] [Applause]
[36:46] &gt;&gt; Oh, give the Lord a hand clap of praise
[36:47] this morning for the West. Aren't you
[36:51] thankful we got one more valley to
[36:52] cross? Soon it'll all be over. Amen. You
[36:56] may have your seats.
[36:57] [Music]
[37:07] &gt;&gt; I don't know why anybody would do a guy
[37:08] that way.
[37:10] My goodness. I ain't sang this in
[37:12] forever. He's going to put me up behind
[37:13] those two.
[37:15] Uh, no, for real though, this song is my
[37:17] testimony. Really, it has been for years
[37:19] and years. If y'all know it, sing it
[37:21] with me.
[37:31] I stood in
[37:34] the courtroom.
[37:36] The judge turned
[37:39] my way.
[37:41] Said, "Looks like you're guilty
[37:46] now. What do you say?"
[37:51] I spoke of
[37:53] your
[37:55] I have no
[37:58] defense.
[38:00] But that's when
[38:03] mercy
[38:04] walked in.
[38:09] Oh, mercy
[38:11] walked in
[38:14] and pleaded.
[38:16] My keys
[38:18] was called to the stand
[38:23] was God's saving
[38:26] grace.
[38:28] The blood was
[38:30] presented.
[38:33] It covered my sins.
[38:37] Forgiven
[38:39] when mercy
[38:41] walked in.
[38:46] I stood there
[38:49] and wondered,
[38:51] "How could
[38:53] this be
[38:55] that someone
[38:58] so guilty
[39:00] just been set free?
[39:06] Oh, as my chains
[39:09] were broken
[39:11] and I was born again.
[39:15] It was the moment
[39:18] that mercy
[39:20] walked in.
[39:22] [Music]
[39:24] Oh, mercy
[39:27] walked in
[39:29] and pleaded
[39:31] my case.
[39:34] called to the stand
[39:38] was God's saving grace
[39:43] to love was
[39:45] presented
[39:47] that covered my sin
[39:52] forgiven
[39:54] when mercy
[39:56] walked
[39:58] [Music]
[40:06] What is it?
[40:10] The courtroom.
[40:12] The judge turned
[40:15] my way.
[40:17] It looks like you're guilty.
[40:21] Now what do you say?
[40:26] [Music]
[40:28] You're on.
[40:30] I have no
[40:33] defense.
[40:34] &gt;&gt; It was the moment
[40:37] that mercy
[40:39] walked in.
[40:40] &gt;&gt; Oh, let's all stand and sing it together
[40:42] now. Oh mercy
[40:46] walked in
[40:48] and pleaded
[40:50] in my hand
[40:52] [Music]
[40:53] called to the saint
[40:57] was God's saving grace.
[41:02] The blood was
[41:04] presented
[41:06] and you covered my sins.
[41:11] forgiven
[41:13] when mercy
[41:15] walked in. I stood there and wondered.
[41:20] I stood there
[41:22] in one
[41:24] how could
[41:26] this be?
[41:27] &gt;&gt; Oh, think about it. How
[41:29] &gt;&gt; if someone
[41:31] so guilty
[41:33] had just been set free?
[41:38] My
[41:40] and my chains
[41:42] were broken
[41:44] and I was born again.
[41:48] It was the moment
[41:51] God's mercy walked in.
[41:56] Aren't you thankful for mercy
[42:00] walked in
[42:02] and pleaded in my
[42:07] call to the stand
[42:11] was God's saving grace.
[42:15] The blood was
[42:18] presented
[42:20] and covered
[42:22] my sins,
[42:25] forgiven
[42:27] when mercy
[42:29] walked in.
[42:31] &gt;&gt; Oh, give the Lord a hand. Clap of praise
[42:33] this morning. Aren't you thankful this
[42:35] mercy walked in, stood on your behalf,
[42:38] and said, "You're not guilty." Oh, he's
[42:40] certainly so good to us today. So, we
[42:42] get ready to invite our pastor to come
[42:44] and bring the word. Let's just sing that
[42:45] little song. Because he lives. Because
[42:47] He lives.
[42:50] And because He lives,
[42:56] I can face tomorrow.
[43:01] Oh, because
[43:03] he lives. Oh, all fear is gone. Oh, all
[43:08] fear is gone.
[43:13] Because I know
[43:19] he holds my future
[43:24] and life is worth the living just
[43:30] because he lives. Sing it again now.
[43:35] And because he lives.
[43:40] Oh, I could face to go
[43:46] because
[43:47] he
[43:51] all fear is gone. All fear is gone. And
[43:57] because I hope
[44:01] behold
[44:03] the future
[44:04] [Music]
[44:07] and life is worth the living just
[44:12] because he lives.
[44:18] In one day soon,
[44:23] I'm going to cross the river
[44:28] and last final war.
[44:33] The final war will rage.
[44:39] And in this flesh,
[44:44] it'll give way to victory.
[44:47] [Music]
[44:49] And I'll see the light of glory. And
[44:54] I'll know my savior lives.
[45:00] Yes. Because he lives,
[45:05] I can face tomorrow.
[45:10] Because
[45:12] he lives,
[45:15] all my fear is gone.
[45:20] And because I know,
[45:23] yes, I know, he holds the future.
[45:30] And life is worth the living just
[45:36] because of me.
[45:40] Oh, my life is worth living just because
[45:47] he lives.
[45:51] [Music]
[45:53] Amen. How many believes that this
[45:54] morning?
[45:55] &gt;&gt; Amen. And the only reason that we have a
[45:58] life worth living is because of what
[46:01] Christ has already done for us. Amen.
[46:04] You love the Lord this morning. Amen.
[46:06] Just say it's good to be in the house of
[46:07] the Lord. And certainly a a privilege
[46:10] just to be able to come and fellowship
[46:12] around the word of God. And want to
[46:14] welcome everyone here this morning, all
[46:16] of our uh church and visitors as well.
[46:18] And just trust that the Lord would be
[46:21] able to say something that would be a
[46:22] help to you. May we just bow our heads
[46:24] this morning before we open the word.
[46:26] And if you have something on your heart
[46:27] that you'd like the Lord to do and I
[46:30] know that God is certainly more than
[46:32] able. So we just want to rely upon him
[46:35] this morning and he knows all the
[46:37] answers. He knows what we have need of.
[46:39] And so we just want God to have his way.
[46:41] So let's just pray together. Gracious
[46:43] heavenly father, Lord, I just say it's a
[46:45] privilege this morning, Lord, to come
[46:48] together in a building with the saints
[46:51] of God. And Lord, just to feel your
[46:53] spirit moving about this place. And
[46:55] Lord, what a a special anointing Lord is
[46:59] here this morning. God, we just thank
[47:01] you for being in our midst. Lord, we
[47:03] thank you for all that you do for us.
[47:05] Lord, we thank you for your word. And
[47:07] God, we thank you for your presence
[47:09] among your church.
[47:10] Lord, we just ask you this morning that
[47:12] you would move among the body. And Lord,
[47:14] I pray that you would meet every heart.
[47:16] And God, I pray you would meet every
[47:18] need. Those that would need healing,
[47:20] Lord, I pray that you would heal their
[47:21] bodies. Lord, those that need
[47:23] deliverance, Lord. May you deliver them,
[47:25] God. Whatever it is we have need of,
[47:27] Lord, I know that we have many gone
[47:29] today. And Lord, we just ask you to
[47:30] bless our ministering brothers, Lord, as
[47:32] they're ministering. And Lord, uh that
[47:35] the churches that they are at, Lord,
[47:36] would be blessed. And Lord, I pray for
[47:39] those that are homesick, Lord, that you
[47:40] would bring them back. And Lord, we just
[47:43] ask you now that you would touch the
[47:44] church this morning in a special way. In
[47:47] the name of Jesus Christ, we pray. Amen.
[47:51] Amen. God bless you this morning. Amen.
[47:53] How many loves the Lord this morning?
[47:55] Amen. We're sure glad to be in the house
[47:56] of the Lord. God bless y'all. Thank you.
[47:58] Uh we're going to read out of the book
[48:00] of Psalms this morning in the book of uh
[48:02] uh the 119th chapter and we'll read out
[48:06] of the 59th verse. So Psalms 119 and 59.
[48:10] Uh give you a moment just to turn there
[48:12] and then also we would like to read out
[48:15] of the book of Acts in the 16th chapter.
[48:17] So uh Psalms 119
[48:21] and 59. We'll start there. Amen. When
[48:24] you get there just say amen.
[48:26] sure enjoyed the service uh Wednesday
[48:29] and and the Sunday before. God's just
[48:32] really uh good to us and I sure love to
[48:35] be able to come. I after the service
[48:36] Wednesday night, we uh had a little
[48:39] singing after church and had several
[48:40] that stayed over and singing and spirit
[48:43] lord was just moving. We done that for
[48:44] about an hour and then we had about an
[48:46] hourlong testimony service on the first
[48:48] uh two pews. So, it was it was way up in
[48:51] the middle of the night when we all
[48:52] left. But we just really appreciate the
[48:55] presence of God and seeing young people
[48:57] on fire for the Lord and and I certainly
[49:01] I can't think of anything greater. It's
[49:03] a uh it it really makes you uh feel uh
[49:07] like you're you're doing something to
[49:09] make an impact in somebody's life
[49:10] whenever you can see young people with a
[49:13] zeal to do something for God. Isn't that
[49:15] true? You just see so many young people
[49:17] in this world today and uh they have
[49:20] zeals to do other things. But to see a
[49:22] young people that wants to do something
[49:23] for the Lord, it just touches my heart.
[49:25] So I want to read this morning uh Psalms
[49:28] 119 and 59. Just something the Lord has
[49:30] put on my heart. And David said, "I
[49:33] thought on my ways and turned my feet
[49:36] unto thy testimonies. I made haste and
[49:39] delayed not to keep thy commandments.
[49:41] The bands of the wicked have robbed me,
[49:43] but I have not forgotten thy law. and at
[49:46] midnight I will rise to give thanks unto
[49:48] thee because of thy righteous judgments.
[49:52] I'd also like to read out of the book of
[49:55] Acts the 16th chapter and we'll read in
[49:57] the 23rd verse. Acts 16 and 23. We'll
[50:01] read down to the 26th verse. The Bible
[50:04] says, "And when they had laid many
[50:06] stripes upon them, they cast them into
[50:09] prison, charging the jailer to keep them
[50:11] safely, who having received such a
[50:14] charge, thrust them into the inner
[50:16] prison, and made their feet fast in the
[50:19] stocks." And at midnight Paul and Silas
[50:22] prayed, and they sang praises unto God,
[50:25] and the prisoners heard them, and
[50:26] suddenly there was a great earthquake,
[50:29] so that the foundations of the earth uh
[50:33] the prison were shaken, and immediately
[50:35] all the doors were opened and everyone's
[50:38] bands were loosed. We'll just ask the
[50:40] Lord to add his blessing uh to the
[50:42] reading of word this morning. As you
[50:44] take your seats,
[50:46] I want to take these two scriptures and
[50:49] uh uh use as a a connection between
[50:51] them. Uh I'd like to speak on this
[50:53] subject this morning. On a night of
[50:56] prayer brings a day of deliverance. A
[50:59] night of prayer brings a day of
[51:01] deliverance. Now, I believe our I
[51:03] certainly appreciate our church and uh
[51:05] uh the power of God in the church. How
[51:07] many appreciates that? I I appreciate
[51:09] the spirit of revival and and the
[51:11] atmosphere that is in the building. This
[51:14] is a church that is charged with the
[51:15] spirit of God. And uh I I can't think of
[51:18] a better place I'd rather be this
[51:19] morning than right here. And uh uh and
[51:22] being able to be in fellowship with you
[51:24] all. And uh such a such a great
[51:26] atmosphere in the church. And and the
[51:29] reason is is because we make the word of
[51:31] God the preeminence for the church. It
[51:33] don't it don't we don't hold nothing
[51:34] back, Brother Brian. So if it's if it's
[51:36] corrective, we just take it and say
[51:38] amen. If it's a revival, we just take it
[51:40] and say amen. If it's encouraging, we
[51:42] just take it and say amen. So we make
[51:44] the word of God a preeminence. We ain't
[51:46] worried about feelings and and how uh
[51:48] how that we would feel about what God
[51:50] has to say. Nothing like that. We uh the
[51:52] only thing we care about is the word of
[51:54] God having preeminence over our life.
[51:56] How many believes that? See, that's the
[51:58] kind of church that we have and that's
[51:59] the reason we have the kind of spirit we
[52:01] have in the church. And so our our
[52:03] desire is that we want to be the best
[52:06] Christians that we can be. How many say
[52:07] that I we want to have the best church
[52:09] that we can have. And you know I believe
[52:11] that ought to be the desire of any
[52:13] church. And you know brother Brandon was
[52:15] actually speaking of the Pentecostal
[52:16] condition. And he preached a message
[52:18] called getting into the spirit. And he
[52:20] would say this. He said, "We put too
[52:22] much on mountaintop experiences of
[52:24] dancing and shaking and jumping around
[52:26] instead of all night prayer meetings
[52:28] down in the valley of decision where you
[52:31] have to come down there and meet God and
[52:33] really pour out your life until
[52:35] something takes place." See, there's
[52:37] many that are looking for revival.
[52:39] They're looking for a move of God and a
[52:41] move of the spirit of God. And they and
[52:43] we love to dance and we love to shout
[52:45] and we love to uh we love to have that
[52:47] experience. But here, brother Ram was
[52:48] actually given the recipe how to bring
[52:51] that true Pentecostal experience into
[52:53] the church. He said it's one where we
[52:55] can get back to all night prayer
[52:56] meetings, get down in the valley of
[52:58] decision and come down in a place to
[53:00] really meet God. And so we realize that
[53:02] this is very needed because we're living
[53:04] in the age of Leodysia. How many knows
[53:06] that? And in how many knows what the age
[53:07] of Leoa is? And the the Bible would say
[53:10] Leodysa was the age of spiritual
[53:12] lukewarmness. It was when the church was
[53:15] neither cold nor hot. and and God said,
[53:17] "But I will spew you out of my mouth."
[53:19] So, I'm thankful today that when we're
[53:21] living in this spirit of Leoa that that
[53:24] we have a message today that identify
[53:26] what it was that brought coldness into
[53:28] the church. So, we don't have to just
[53:30] have a cold church because we know what
[53:31] brings coldness into the church. So, we
[53:33] don't have to settle for formalism and
[53:35] coldness and and lukewarmness and all
[53:37] that things all those things. So, we
[53:39] know what brings coldness into the
[53:41] church and we know what the church has
[53:43] to do to keep coldness out. But remember
[53:45] said, "See, when we see our churches
[53:47] cooling down and those things not
[53:48] happening," he said, "you have to wait
[53:50] until some special evangelist comes into
[53:52] town or something and beat on a few
[53:54] tambourines to to work up a little
[53:56] emotion." But God isn't in that. Said,
[53:59] "But I'll tell you what we need today is
[54:01] a back to an old Bible again. Back to an
[54:04] oldfashioned Pentecostal teaching of the
[54:06] Bible. Back to the Bible to the Holy
[54:08] Ghost. Back to the power of God. back to
[54:11] all night prayer meetings where they're
[54:13] hungering and thirsting for God. That's
[54:15] what we need tonight in our churches.
[54:17] How many believes that? I believe I I
[54:19] think I'm so glad that we're a part of a
[54:21] church that still believes that. I I'm
[54:23] glad to be a part of a church that has
[54:25] people that that labor spiritually for
[54:27] the body of Christ. Our elders in our
[54:29] church, they labor. They spend all night
[54:31] and days and praying and laboring for
[54:34] the church and are laboring for the
[54:35] body. They seek God for the needs of the
[54:38] young people and the families and and
[54:40] those that are in trouble there. Uh we
[54:42] have so many that labor for the Lord.
[54:44] And you know, I had somebody ask me, you
[54:45] know, about our church and how our
[54:47] church had been so blessed and how far
[54:49] along we've came in such a short period
[54:51] of time and and uh and would say that,
[54:53] you know, that I've never seen uh a
[54:56] church in the United States that has
[54:58] grown at at at the at the the way that
[55:00] that this church has grown and in in in
[55:03] such a a period of time that it has. and
[55:05] and you know and what what would cause a
[55:07] church to grow that way. And I thought,
[55:08] you know, you could say, well, was it
[55:10] the preaching or was it the singing or
[55:12] was it the testimony or what wasn't all
[55:14] this? But the reality is I attribute all
[55:16] of the growth of our entire church to
[55:18] the elders that are laying in prayer for
[55:21] the body of Christ. I It comes from
[55:23] prayer. It comes from real elders that
[55:25] are truehearted and and real men and
[55:27] women of God that will take the time to
[55:29] lay in prayer before God asking for the
[55:31] spirit of God to come amongst the church
[55:33] of the living. You want to know why you
[55:35] have a revival? It's because somebody
[55:37] was laying in prayer and praying for a
[55:39] revival and they they let the things of
[55:40] the world go by and all the things of
[55:43] the flesh go by and they would get alone
[55:45] with God. And I know what people say,
[55:46] well, brother M, you put too much
[55:48] emphasis on prayer. But you know what?
[55:50] Honestly, I don't think we put enough on
[55:51] it. You, brother said, when you go to
[55:53] praying for somebody, something takes
[55:55] place. He said, and that's where we fail
[55:57] is not praying. It because prayer is the
[56:00] key note. It don't matter what your
[56:02] situation is this morning. And that's
[56:03] the answer to it is to lay in prayer
[56:06] before God and lay and ask God for the
[56:08] answer and ask God for direction. For
[56:10] the Bible said, "Ask and you shall
[56:12] receive and you have not because you ask
[56:14] not. And you ask not because you believe
[56:16] not. And ask in abundance that your joy
[56:19] may be full." The whole Bible tells us
[56:21] to pray to God and get an answer from
[56:23] God. It don't it don't matter what what
[56:25] it is that you're praying for or what
[56:27] situation that you're in, but the answer
[56:29] is to lay in prayer before God and find
[56:32] the answer uh to what what your need is.
[56:34] He said, see, and when you ask, believe.
[56:37] And when you ask and believe, then hold
[56:38] on to it and don't leave it. For if it's
[56:41] a promise that's in the Bible and it's
[56:43] been revealed to you that God is going
[56:44] to give it to you, then you just hold on
[56:47] to it. Somebody say hold on to it. So,
[56:49] it doesn't matter what it is or how long
[56:51] ago it was. I'm not going to go through
[56:52] the whole Bible this morning. I could
[56:54] tell you testimonies for the next 100
[56:56] hours about people that prayed for
[56:58] something that didn't come for years or
[57:00] months or many years down the road. He
[57:02] said, "But it didn't matter. If God gave
[57:04] you a promise, you hold on to it until
[57:06] it comes to pass. Hold on to the promise
[57:09] of God." You know, I think it's so easy
[57:11] to get wrapped up in the things of the
[57:12] world. And it's so easy to get
[57:14] comfortable in the world and let our
[57:16] guard down and let the things of this uh
[57:19] this life begin to creep in or seep in
[57:22] uh into our life. And you know, brother
[57:24] B would talk about that and say how how
[57:26] that that that when the world becomes to
[57:28] begins to creep into the church or comes
[57:30] to creep into your life. He said don't
[57:32] let the world get into your churches. He
[57:34] said well how how will I keep it out? He
[57:36] said you're going to pray it out.
[57:38] &gt;&gt; How you going to keep the world out of
[57:39] my life? You're going to pray it out. He
[57:41] said, "You pray and fast until God comes
[57:43] down and takes a hold." That's right.
[57:45] Keep the joy of the Lord among the
[57:47] saints. Keep them prayed up and guard
[57:50] every little place. You see, that's what
[57:52] Noah would have done if a leak was
[57:53] trying to get into the ark. Noah would
[57:55] have took the pitch and he would blocked
[57:57] up the hole so that there wasn't no
[57:59] water or no leak that could come into
[58:00] the ark. He said, "That's the same way
[58:02] it is in the church of the living God or
[58:04] or in any believer's life. Whenever
[58:06] there's a leak or something that's
[58:08] trying to infiltrate your life or a
[58:09] spirit that's trying to infiltrate the
[58:11] church, he said, "What do you do about
[58:13] it?" Then you pray to God because prayer
[58:16] is what stops the leak. You pray and let
[58:18] God change things. That's the only way
[58:20] to do it. It's prayer. I believe the
[58:22] Bible teaches us that prayer changes
[58:24] things. How many say amen? He said, "I
[58:26] believe it's the prayer of faith that
[58:27] saves the sick. It's prayer. It it means
[58:30] it don't matter what the situation. It
[58:32] don't matter how bad it looks. Sister
[58:34] Cindy, you pray and prayer changes
[58:36] things. Prayer is the answer. It It's
[58:39] prayer that brings lost loved ones home.
[58:41] It's prayer that brings your children
[58:42] that have been out in the world that
[58:44] brings them back to God. You could tell
[58:45] a story about what they done and how
[58:47] they found a place and how they found
[58:49] deliverance and how they wandered off
[58:51] off of that that downward path and they
[58:53] and they finally found a place and altar
[58:55] to come back to God. And you can say,
[58:57] well, all these wonderful things that
[58:59] took place in their life and somebody
[59:00] witnessed to them and somebody testified
[59:03] or they heard a word at the right time
[59:05] and that was the reason. But friends,
[59:06] the real reason is behind all of that,
[59:09] there was somebody that was praying and
[59:11] asking God to intercede there. There was
[59:13] somebody that was praying. That's the
[59:15] reason they met the testimony. That's
[59:17] the reason they heard the preaching of
[59:19] the word. That's the reason they found
[59:21] their theirelves at an altar somewhere
[59:23] is because there was a praying person
[59:25] somewhere, a praying mama or a praying
[59:27] daddy or a praying church. Somebody was
[59:29] craving praying for the move of God in
[59:32] that person's life. So, see, it's prayer
[59:34] that changes things. It don't matter how
[59:36] bad it looks. It's prayer is the answer.
[59:38] I believe there's power in prayer this
[59:40] morning. How many say there's power in
[59:41] prayer? If you need healing, there's
[59:43] power in prayer. If you need
[59:45] deliverance, there's power in prayer. If
[59:47] you need your joy, there's power in
[59:49] prayer. If you need salvation, there's
[59:51] power in prayer. If you're having
[59:53] trouble in your in your home and
[59:54] finances, there's power in prayer. If
[59:57] there's trouble in your marriage,
[59:58] there's power in prayer. If there's
[1:00:00] problems in your family, there's power
[1:00:02] in prayer.
[1:00:03] &gt;&gt; It doesn't matter how bad the problem
[1:00:05] is. I think the biggest problem that we
[1:00:07] get into is trying to fix our problems.
[1:00:09] You know what it takes for for you to
[1:00:11] try to fix your own problems? It takes
[1:00:13] you looking at God and saying, "My
[1:00:15] problem's too big for you to fix. So,
[1:00:16] I'm going to have to fix it myself. And
[1:00:18] friends, that's where we wind up in
[1:00:20] trouble. But I think what we ought to do
[1:00:21] is just lay in prayer before God and
[1:00:24] keep your hands out of it and let God
[1:00:26] come in and let God take care of your
[1:00:28] children and let God lead them to the
[1:00:29] word of God. There ain't nothing that
[1:00:31] you could do that would that would make
[1:00:33] them have a relationship with God. It
[1:00:35] takes God coming down in the middle of
[1:00:37] the night and dealing with a person's
[1:00:39] heart.
[1:00:40] &gt;&gt; It's not too big for God.
[1:00:42] &gt;&gt; My problems ain't too big for God.
[1:00:44] Hello, somebody. My troubles ain't too
[1:00:46] big for God. So I want to bring them to
[1:00:48] the Lord. My burdens, they ain't too big
[1:00:50] for God. They I want to bring them to
[1:00:52] the Lord.
[1:00:53] &gt;&gt; David said, "The righteous cry and the
[1:00:55] Lord heareth and deliverth them out of
[1:00:58] all of their troubles." Somebody say,
[1:01:00] "All
[1:01:01] &gt;&gt; delivers them out of all of their
[1:01:03] troubles."
[1:01:04] The Bible would tell us a story of Jacob
[1:01:07] in Genesis the 32nd chapter. And Jacob
[1:01:10] was traveling. You remember how he was
[1:01:12] traveling that that night back to the
[1:01:15] homeland. Remember, he had had an order
[1:01:16] from God to go back to the homeland. And
[1:01:19] we find in this 32nd chapter, he spends
[1:01:21] a night alone with the Lord.
[1:01:24] &gt;&gt; Remember when Jacob was on this this
[1:01:26] journey, he was traveling with his
[1:01:27] family and children in this great
[1:01:29] caravan. And the Bible would say that he
[1:01:31] sent them over over the brook and he
[1:01:34] sent all that he had over and said,
[1:01:36] "Y'all y'all just go on and you meet you
[1:01:38] meet Esau. And when you meet Esau, tell
[1:01:40] him all this is a gift to him. That way,
[1:01:42] and tell him that that Jacob's coming
[1:01:44] behind you whenever and whenever he
[1:01:46] finds me, maybe he'll maybe he'll greet
[1:01:48] me in it. He'll greet me well. But the
[1:01:50] Bible says he would send them all over
[1:01:52] the brook. And here they were on this
[1:01:54] journey to meet Esau. The Bible said
[1:01:56] Jacob was left alone. And there he
[1:01:57] wrestled a man until the breaking of the
[1:01:59] day. And when he saw that he could not
[1:02:00] prevail against him, the man touched the
[1:02:02] hollow of his thigh and he wrestled with
[1:02:04] him. He said, "Let me go, for the day
[1:02:06] breakth." And Jacob said, "But I will
[1:02:08] not let thee go except thou bless me."
[1:02:11] So, see, he was left alone in the middle
[1:02:13] of this great night, in the middle of
[1:02:15] this great toil. And brother Wesley,
[1:02:17] what he done is he wrestled with the
[1:02:18] Lord all night long looking for a
[1:02:20] blessing. He said he he was wrestling
[1:02:22] for a blessing. He was my that'll preach
[1:02:25] right there. He was wrestling for a
[1:02:26] blessing. He was toiling because there
[1:02:28] was something that he had need of in his
[1:02:30] life. And so, he was willing to toil. He
[1:02:32] was willing to labor and he was willing
[1:02:34] to fight. And you say, "Well, brother,
[1:02:35] you know, any any believer that's ever
[1:02:37] laid in pray and prayed before God can
[1:02:39] say that ain't nothing but the truth."
[1:02:41] It's a battle to lay in prayer. It ain't
[1:02:43] easy to lay all night in the middle of
[1:02:45] prayer. It ain't because our flesh don't
[1:02:47] allow you to pray very long. And our
[1:02:49] flesh gets in the way. And I tell you,
[1:02:51] just as soon as you start to go take
[1:02:53] some time between you and God, the kids
[1:02:55] will start crying. 10 people will call
[1:02:57] you. Everybody all of a sudden has
[1:02:58] problem. I have to turn my phone off to
[1:03:00] pray because it don't matter. The minute
[1:03:02] I kneel down to pray, my phone's going
[1:03:04] to ring. Somebody's going to text.
[1:03:06] Somebody needs something. Somebody's got
[1:03:08] a flat tire. But sometimes you just have
[1:03:10] to shut it all off and be alone with
[1:03:12] God. This is where Jacob was. He He sent
[1:03:15] everybody on. He got everybody away from
[1:03:17] him. And the Bible said he stayed alone
[1:03:19] where it was just him and God. And he
[1:03:21] wrestled with the Lord. And he toyed
[1:03:23] with the Lord because he needed a
[1:03:25] blessing in his life. He was willing to
[1:03:27] wrestle. I wonder how many has a need
[1:03:28] this morning. I wonder how many had a
[1:03:30] great need that they're willing to
[1:03:31] wrestle and and willing to stay all
[1:03:33] night and willing to wait until God
[1:03:35] could come and intercede for their need.
[1:03:38] He had such a need. You say, "Well, why
[1:03:40] did he want a blessing that bad?" Do you
[1:03:42] realize the condition that Jacob was in
[1:03:44] here? When Jacob here here he had come
[1:03:47] to this place or to the brook. Now, you
[1:03:49] know the story of Jacob. I just I just
[1:03:50] lay it out there for but but when he
[1:03:52] came to the brook and he had heard that
[1:03:54] Esau his brother was coming to meet him,
[1:03:56] Jacob was running from his past. When he
[1:03:58] came to this place, there was such a
[1:04:00] fear came over him because Jacob had he
[1:04:03] had really badly misled. He had deceived
[1:04:05] Esau. Remember from the time of his
[1:04:07] child and and time of them growing up,
[1:04:09] Esau had something that Jacob wanted. He
[1:04:11] had a birthight. And so, Jacob was
[1:04:13] willing to do whatever it took to get
[1:04:14] the birthight e even to where he would
[1:04:17] rob it from him when he had such a need
[1:04:19] for food and he say, "Well, I'll give
[1:04:21] you food if you'll give me your
[1:04:22] birthight." He would he would he would
[1:04:24] take advantage to get the birthight. He
[1:04:26] would he would even go to his father
[1:04:28] Isaac when he was laying on his
[1:04:30] deathbed. He took the skin of an animal
[1:04:32] and put it on his own skin so that his
[1:04:34] blind father would feel of him and think
[1:04:36] he was Esau. He would take the scent of
[1:04:38] Esau and put it on his body. His mother
[1:04:41] would prepare food like Esau would have
[1:04:43] prepared it and he took it to his father
[1:04:45] and he laid it there so his father would
[1:04:47] think he was Esau just so he could get
[1:04:50] the blessing from his father Isaac. And
[1:04:52] you know what Isaac done? He blessed
[1:04:53] him. He said, "The blessing of this
[1:04:56] house shall be upon you." And the Bible
[1:04:58] said, "But after he blessed him, when
[1:05:00] Esau came in, he found out that his
[1:05:02] brother had stolen his blessing." And
[1:05:05] because he had stolen his blessing, and
[1:05:06] now Esau had made a vow that the next
[1:05:10] time I lay my eyes upon Jacob, I am
[1:05:12] going to kill him. He had made a vow to
[1:05:15] murder him. His mother had known about
[1:05:17] the vow. She warned Jacob that your
[1:05:18] brother Esau, he he that he hates you
[1:05:21] and and and he hates you because of the
[1:05:23] blessing of your father. And he has said
[1:05:25] in his heart that after the mourning of
[1:05:27] his father is over that he's going to
[1:05:29] find you and he's going to take your
[1:05:30] life. See, so here whenever Jacob would
[1:05:33] come to this brook and he would find out
[1:05:35] that there that Esau was coming with a
[1:05:37] band to meet him, all of a sudden the
[1:05:40] fear of his past came upon him. He he I
[1:05:42] I was a deceiver and and I fled the I
[1:05:45] fled my past and I fled my brother and
[1:05:48] and and and all this he had fled from
[1:05:50] his presence. And you know what took
[1:05:52] place whenever he fled from the presence
[1:05:54] of Esau. Jacob had met God before. This
[1:05:56] wasn't the first experience he had had
[1:05:58] with God. See, whenever he fled out of
[1:06:00] that land, the Bible says when he left,
[1:06:02] he came to the place of Bethl and God
[1:06:04] met him there. Remember when Jacob laid
[1:06:06] down and he had the dream and he said,
[1:06:08] "I saw a ladder that ascended or all the
[1:06:11] way up into heaven." He said, "And I saw
[1:06:13] the angels of God ascending and
[1:06:15] descending upon the ladder." He said,
[1:06:17] "And and all of a sudden I looked up and
[1:06:18] the Lord stood above it and he said, I
[1:06:20] am the Lord God of Abraham thy father
[1:06:23] and the God of Isaac and the land
[1:06:25] whereon thou liest to thee will I give
[1:06:28] it and to thy seed." And when Jacob
[1:06:30] awoke from his sleep, he said, "Surely
[1:06:32] the Lord is in this place." My wouldn't
[1:06:34] you wouldn't you say that and I knew it
[1:06:36] not. He said I was afraid. He said how
[1:06:38] dreadful is this place. He went from
[1:06:40] fearing Esau to fearing God. I was
[1:06:42] afraid of my brother and I fled out of
[1:06:44] the land of my homeland. But when I came
[1:06:46] to this place and I realized there was
[1:06:48] something supernatural that was taking
[1:06:50] place in the middle of the desert. And
[1:06:52] here God be to deal with his heart and
[1:06:54] he said this ain't nothing but the house
[1:06:56] of God. It's the gateway to heaven. You
[1:06:58] say, "Well, why did he call it the house
[1:07:00] of God?" It wasn't that just like we
[1:07:01] come in this place. It ain't because
[1:07:03] there's four walls and we put a church
[1:07:05] name on the building. It's because there
[1:07:06] was an experience that happened in that
[1:07:09] place of Bethl. And when there's a place
[1:07:10] that you can find an experience with
[1:07:12] God, we call it a house of God or the
[1:07:14] dwelling of God, it must be a place
[1:07:16] where God comes to meet men. Oh friends,
[1:07:18] I pray that that's what this church
[1:07:20] would always be. I pray it'd be a place
[1:07:22] where God can come and meet men and God
[1:07:24] can come and meet women that would that
[1:07:26] that are in a need or that that are
[1:07:28] fleeing their past that are that are
[1:07:29] running from something in their life
[1:07:31] that they might run into the refuge or
[1:07:33] the tower of God and find refuge in this
[1:07:36] hour.
[1:07:37] &gt;&gt; See, it was a place of God. It was the
[1:07:39] gateway to heaven. See, that's what an
[1:07:40] experience with God always feels like.
[1:07:42] You get up from it and say, "Man, that
[1:07:44] was a that was the gateway to heaven. I
[1:07:46] I I was I was walking up. I was I was
[1:07:48] being entertained by the angels of
[1:07:50] heaven." How many's ever had an
[1:07:51] experience like that? I was late. It
[1:07:53] don't matter if you was in the woods. It
[1:07:54] didn't matter if you was in church. It
[1:07:56] didn't matter if you was in your prayer
[1:07:57] closet at home. But when you're
[1:07:58] entertained by angels and you're in the
[1:08:00] presence of God, you say, "This is the
[1:08:02] gateway to heaven.
[1:08:04] &gt;&gt; It was an experience with God. It was
[1:08:06] the ladder he saw that came all the way
[1:08:08] from earth to heaven." You realize, I
[1:08:11] think this is so powerful, that that was
[1:08:12] God's ladder.
[1:08:14] &gt;&gt; You realize men had already tried to do
[1:08:16] what Jacob saw. In the Bible, they said
[1:08:18] they built the tower of Babel trying to
[1:08:20] reach heaven. That was a man-made tower
[1:08:22] trying to reach heaven. But man will
[1:08:24] never do it by any man-made way. Said,
[1:08:26] but whenever he came to an experience
[1:08:28] with God, then God put a ladder there.
[1:08:30] And God, it was a God- made ladder that
[1:08:33] opened up the windows of heaven that he
[1:08:34] could ascend, the angels could ascend
[1:08:36] and descend. Friends, I got news for you
[1:08:38] this morning that God has provided a
[1:08:40] ladder in this hour. I know men have
[1:08:42] built great towers and they built great
[1:08:44] churches and they built great
[1:08:46] denominational uh teachings and all
[1:08:48] these great things that are made by men,
[1:08:50] but it'll never reach heaven. But the
[1:08:52] only thing will reach heaven is the
[1:08:53] ladder that God has built and his name
[1:08:55] is Jesus Christ. It was placed on the
[1:08:58] earth and it reached all the way up into
[1:09:00] glory and it made a way for a man to
[1:09:02] climb out of the nature of this flesh
[1:09:04] right into the heaven to be alone with
[1:09:06] God.
[1:09:07] &gt;&gt; It was God's ladder. Said see Jesus had
[1:09:10] provided a ladder. That's what brother
[1:09:11] said. When a when a person come down to
[1:09:13] the altar, a little boy and his mother,
[1:09:15] he said, "Oh Lord, may on this step, may
[1:09:18] they realize that they are on Jacob's
[1:09:20] ladder. They're moving upward now from
[1:09:22] this earthbound sin and things that's
[1:09:24] kept them from having fellowship with
[1:09:26] God."
[1:09:26] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:09:27] &gt;&gt; Even when you kneel down to pray, when
[1:09:29] you kneel down and and come into
[1:09:31] forgiveness, you're kneeling on that
[1:09:33] same ladder that Jacob saw. My isn't
[1:09:35] that a thought this morning that the
[1:09:37] very thing that Jacob saw in his dream
[1:09:39] that when you kneel down to pray to God
[1:09:41] that you're kneeling down on that very
[1:09:42] same ladder.
[1:09:44] &gt;&gt; He said, "See, but he fled from his
[1:09:47] brother. He fled from this promise of
[1:09:50] death." But how many realize this
[1:09:52] morning that that wasn't the only
[1:09:53] promise that Jacob had? See, because
[1:09:56] listen, one was a promise of death, but
[1:09:58] he also had a promise of God. I think
[1:10:00] this is so powerful because whenever God
[1:10:03] speaks to him when he sees the latter,
[1:10:05] listen what he said. The land where on
[1:10:07] thou liest to thee will I give it and to
[1:10:10] thy seed.
[1:10:12] &gt;&gt; Now Jacob was a bachelor.
[1:10:14] &gt;&gt; He had no children. He had no wife. He
[1:10:17] met God. He was his brother was pursuing
[1:10:19] after him. He was coming to take his
[1:10:21] life. He was fleeing from the wrath of
[1:10:23] his brother. He had no seed. But God
[1:10:26] said, "But unto thy seed I will give
[1:10:28] this land." And I thought right here,
[1:10:29] what a promise that God had made him. I
[1:10:31] I I may not know where I'm going to end
[1:10:33] up, but I know one thing. I'm going to
[1:10:35] have a wife and I'm going to have
[1:10:36] children. My brother ain't going to
[1:10:38] catch me here. But something that God
[1:10:40] had given him a promise. And that
[1:10:41] promise, it didn't just stay there. It
[1:10:43] didn't even just take him into to
[1:10:45] Laban's land or or or to to Rachel and
[1:10:48] Leah. That ain't where it took him. That
[1:10:49] it brought him all the way back home.
[1:10:51] And when God told him after them many
[1:10:53] years, he said to Jacob, "Return unto
[1:10:55] the land of thy fathers and to thy
[1:10:57] kindred." And listen to God's promise.
[1:11:00] And I will be with thee.
[1:11:03] &gt;&gt; So he had two promises. One was a
[1:11:05] promise. It was a curse that was a
[1:11:07] promise of death that came from Esau.
[1:11:09] When I see you, I'm going to kill you.
[1:11:11] One, he fled from it. It was a curse
[1:11:13] that was pursuing after him. But on the
[1:11:15] other hand, he had a promise from God
[1:11:16] that you go ahead and go back to your
[1:11:18] homeland and I'll be with you. And your
[1:11:20] seed, they're going to possess this
[1:11:21] place. Friends, let me tell you, that's
[1:11:23] just like you and I. We have two
[1:11:25] promises over our life. One is a promise
[1:11:27] of death, the other is a promise of
[1:11:29] life. Bam says he's look what he was
[1:11:32] doing. He was looking for a blessing.
[1:11:34] When he went to return back home, he was
[1:11:36] returning back home with this promise of
[1:11:38] God upon his life. You go back into your
[1:11:41] homeland and I will be with thee.
[1:11:43] &gt;&gt; So here in Jacob's mind, when he comes
[1:11:46] back to this place and he he's bringing
[1:11:48] his family and all of a sudden he gets
[1:11:49] word that Esau's coming to meet you. All
[1:11:51] of a sudden, he goes into this place of
[1:11:54] turmoil and he begins to wrestle and he
[1:11:56] said because he saw death. He heard that
[1:11:59] Esau was coming. So he saw that death
[1:12:01] was coming. So here in the face of
[1:12:03] death, Jacob was praying for a blessing
[1:12:06] from God.
[1:12:08] &gt;&gt; Here he was facing his dead. He said,
[1:12:09] "See, Jacob wrestled on and he wouldn't
[1:12:11] turn him loose until he was blessed." He
[1:12:13] said, "That's right. He battled for
[1:12:15] life." My, isn't that the way it was? He
[1:12:17] was fighting the curse of death. He was
[1:12:19] battling for life. That's just where we
[1:12:21] are this morning. We were born in sin.
[1:12:24] We were shaped in iniquity. We come into
[1:12:26] this world speaking lies. When you were
[1:12:28] born into this earth, you were born
[1:12:30] under a curse of this flesh. How many
[1:12:31] knows that? We were born under a curse.
[1:12:34] It wasn't something you did. But soon as
[1:12:36] you were born in this lie, that curse
[1:12:38] has took over your flesh.
[1:12:40] &gt;&gt; Why? Because it was a promise over your
[1:12:41] life. And that curse, let me tell you
[1:12:43] what it does, brother Wesley. When a
[1:12:45] person's born in this life, that curse
[1:12:47] comes and it begins to move on them. It
[1:12:49] starts to take over their flesh. Even
[1:12:51] from a little age, it takes over their
[1:12:53] little flesh. You say, "A little
[1:12:54] innocent child." Well, surely the very
[1:12:56] the very spirit. You You realize that
[1:12:58] demon experience spirits torment
[1:13:00] children even when they're little
[1:13:02] children. You I've got a little niece,
[1:13:04] Charlie. She's an angel. If you ever
[1:13:05] been around her, she would never even f
[1:13:08] a word about her at all. And and and
[1:13:10] little Charlie, you could hold her, but
[1:13:12] if you ever would to put her down and
[1:13:13] pick up another baby, then she'd be mad
[1:13:15] and come and pulling at your arm and
[1:13:17] pulling the baby's hair.
[1:13:19] and innocently trying to to to make get
[1:13:21] her seat back. I thought, what is it
[1:13:23] that would cause a child that was a year
[1:13:26] and a half old to have to be jealous
[1:13:28] because you would hold another baby?
[1:13:30] See, it isn't I it's this flesh that we
[1:13:33] live in or this so simple just to see a
[1:13:36] that's a simple illustration, but to see
[1:13:38] a child jealousy. I have a picture on my
[1:13:41] phone of Salem. I he he won't mind I
[1:13:43] share this. We just having church this
[1:13:44] morning, but I got a picture on my
[1:13:46] phone. I I wish I had it. I'd put it on
[1:13:48] the screen this this morning, but I he
[1:13:50] was about 5 years old and and uh it's
[1:13:52] the cutest picture, but we came in there
[1:13:54] and there was chocolate all over the
[1:13:56] kitchen counter. There was a whole jug
[1:13:57] of Nesquick. It was dumped out and and
[1:13:59] the the jug of milk or the little glass
[1:14:01] of milk had about that much milk and it
[1:14:03] was overflow with Nesquick. The powder
[1:14:05] was over the top of the milk. It was all
[1:14:06] in the floor. It was all over the
[1:14:08] counter. It was quite a mess. And I came
[1:14:10] in and all of a sudden I saw this and I
[1:14:12] said, "Salem, what did you do? Look at
[1:14:14] the mess. I mean, you you made a mess.
[1:14:15] You dumped stuff everywhere." And he
[1:14:17] looked up at me and he goes, "It wasn't
[1:14:19] me."
[1:14:21] I said, "Salem, it was, "What do you
[1:14:23] mean you I didn't you didn't do this?"
[1:14:25] "I didn't do it." I said, "You, Bud, you
[1:14:27] didn't you didn't dump the chocolate
[1:14:28] everywhere and you did." And so, the
[1:14:30] reason I have the I couldn't help it. I
[1:14:31] wanted The reason I have the picture is
[1:14:34] because the Nesquick is all over the
[1:14:36] floor and it's all over the counter and
[1:14:37] it's all over his shirt and it's all
[1:14:39] over his hands and it's all over his
[1:14:41] face and his mouth and his nose. I mean,
[1:14:43] there's chocolate everywhere, all all
[1:14:44] over him. and he's standing there like
[1:14:45] this saying, "I didn't do it." I I
[1:14:47] thought, "Well, you know, no one taught
[1:14:49] him that. He's a good boy now." And but
[1:14:51] but no one no one teaches a kid that.
[1:14:54] But but it's a survival instinct that
[1:14:57] kicks in. You know, I'm my dad's going
[1:14:59] to kill me. I got to I'm just trying to
[1:15:01] survive whatever it takes. But see, even
[1:15:03] as a little child, no one teaches you
[1:15:05] that. No one teaches a kid to lie. They
[1:15:07] don't they don't teach a a a kid to be
[1:15:09] jealous or or or or to do things or act
[1:15:12] out or lash out. That isn't that that
[1:15:13] doesn't come from training that you
[1:15:15] train them as a parent. That's because
[1:15:17] they're born under the curse of this
[1:15:19] flesh. So even as a child, whenever
[1:15:22] you're born, this curse immediately
[1:15:24] takes over. Whenever you're born, your
[1:15:26] body is going to grow a little bit, but
[1:15:28] just in a few days, this body is going
[1:15:29] to go right back into a grave. It's
[1:15:31] because of the curse of this flesh that
[1:15:33] takes over. And because of that curse,
[1:15:35] it causes you to act a certain way. It
[1:15:38] causes you to do a certain a certain
[1:15:39] way. It it makes you susceptible to
[1:15:41] demonic spirits and powers that are
[1:15:44] there to overtake your life to keep you
[1:15:46] from finding your purpose or your place
[1:15:47] in life. And you really realize that you
[1:15:50] were created in the image of God. You
[1:15:51] was created to worship God. You was
[1:15:54] created to be a son and daughter of God.
[1:15:56] But we have a curse that is upon our
[1:15:58] flesh. And because when you're born, you
[1:16:00] go through this or this curse has been
[1:16:02] taken you ever since you was born. It's
[1:16:04] been pursuing after you. It comes to
[1:16:07] destroy you from the time of your birth.
[1:16:09] I don't mean to scare the children, but
[1:16:11] from the time of your birth, that curse
[1:16:12] has been following after you. It follows
[1:16:15] you to school. It follows you to home.
[1:16:17] It follows you to your bedroom, behind
[1:16:19] closed doors. It's the curse of the
[1:16:21] flesh that is trying to take over your
[1:16:23] life.
[1:16:24] &gt;&gt; But listen what Paul said in Romans the
[1:16:26] 5th chapter. He said, "But wherefore, as
[1:16:28] by one man sin entered into the world,
[1:16:31] and death by sin, and so death passed
[1:16:34] upon all men, for all have sinned. For
[1:16:37] unto the law sin was in the world. Until
[1:16:39] the law sin was in the world, but sin is
[1:16:42] not imputed when there is no law.
[1:16:45] Nevertheless, death reigns. So listen
[1:16:46] what he's talking about. He's talking
[1:16:47] about the time between Adam and Moses.
[1:16:50] He says, "So nevertheless, death has
[1:16:52] reigned from Adam to Moses, even over
[1:16:55] them that had not sinned after the
[1:16:57] similitude of Adam's transgression, who
[1:17:00] is the figure of him that was to come.
[1:17:02] But not as the offense, so also is the
[1:17:05] free gift." So here what what Paul is
[1:17:08] saying is that from the time of Adam
[1:17:10] until the time of Moses there was no law
[1:17:13] for a man to break. He says see so after
[1:17:16] the law of Moses came now they could be
[1:17:18] they could they could receive death
[1:17:20] because of the law because the uh it's
[1:17:23] not imputed unto a man sin is it unless
[1:17:26] there's a law for it to be imputed to
[1:17:27] them. So from the time of Adam, this is
[1:17:29] what Paul says. From the time of Adam
[1:17:31] until the time of Moses, that law did
[1:17:33] not exist. But still yet, every man
[1:17:36] died. So see, he didn't sin because
[1:17:39] there was no law that could say he
[1:17:40] sinned. But still yet, they all died.
[1:17:43] From Adam to Moses, they died. Watch
[1:17:44] what he's showing us. He said it wasn't
[1:17:46] because of anything that they done, they
[1:17:48] died. So he says it wasn't as the
[1:17:50] offense that caused them to die. It was
[1:17:53] just the curse that came because of the
[1:17:54] fall of Adam. He said, "And if it wasn't
[1:17:57] because of their offense that caused
[1:17:58] them to die," he said, "then it ain't
[1:18:00] because of their offense that would
[1:18:01] cause them to get a free gift." In other
[1:18:03] words, that you don't have to commit the
[1:18:05] act of Adam that the committed in order
[1:18:07] to be guilty. You're guilty because you
[1:18:09] were born in this flesh. You're guilty
[1:18:11] because of the way that you were born
[1:18:13] into the earth and now this curse has
[1:18:15] fallen after you. He said, "See, you
[1:18:16] were born guilty because of Adam's
[1:18:18] fall." So, in other words, the curse was
[1:18:20] not based on our merit. You don't die
[1:18:23] because you're a bad person. You don't
[1:18:25] die because you broke the law of God.
[1:18:26] You die because of what Adam done. It
[1:18:28] was the fall in the garden. It has
[1:18:30] nothing to do with you. Says, "So death
[1:18:32] isn't based on your merit." And then,
[1:18:34] oh, this is good. He says, "So if death
[1:18:36] isn't based on your merit, then neither
[1:18:38] is the blessing of God based on your
[1:18:41] merit." Said they died because of what
[1:18:43] some other man done, and they'll be
[1:18:45] saved because of what some other man
[1:18:46] done. It ain't based on their merit that
[1:18:49] they died. It ain't based on their merit
[1:18:50] that they were born in flesh. It ain't
[1:18:52] based on their marri that they fell into
[1:18:54] sin and they got addicted to drugs and
[1:18:56] alcohol and lust and the things of this
[1:18:58] world. It wasn't based on their
[1:18:59] marriage. It's the curse of the flesh
[1:19:01] that you were born to. He said, "But it
[1:19:03] ain't their merit that'll get them into
[1:19:05] heaven. It's the very salvation of the
[1:19:07] man Jesus Christ.
[1:19:10] &gt;&gt; The curse didn't come by your merit, and
[1:19:12] neither does the blessing come by your
[1:19:14] merit." He said, he said, "By one man's
[1:19:16] offense, though the offense came by one,
[1:19:18] many dead." He said, "But much more the
[1:19:21] grace of God, the gift of grace, which
[1:19:23] is by one man, Jesus Christ, and not as
[1:19:26] if it had been that one sinned." He
[1:19:28] says, "So is the gift. For the judgment
[1:19:30] was by one to condemnation, but the free
[1:19:33] gift is of many offenses under
[1:19:35] justification. For if by one man's
[1:19:37] offense death reigned by one, then much
[1:19:39] more they which receive the abundance of
[1:19:41] grace and the gift of righteousness
[1:19:43] shall reign in life by one, who is Jesus
[1:19:46] Christ." So, one man's offense put you
[1:19:48] into it and another man's actions took
[1:19:52] you out of it.
[1:19:53] &gt;&gt; Isn't that powerful? It ain't based on
[1:19:54] you. And I don't know about y'all, it
[1:19:56] makes me want to shout a little bit. It
[1:19:57] ain't based on our actions at all. It
[1:19:59] wasn't our actions that brought death.
[1:20:00] And it certainly wasn't our actions that
[1:20:02] brought salvation. See, but this curse,
[1:20:04] it pursues you.
[1:20:06] &gt;&gt; It's pursued you to bring death to your
[1:20:09] life. To bring to bring it's a promise
[1:20:11] to bring to bring death to you. Do you
[1:20:13] realize that even under the law of Mo
[1:20:15] Moses that even when they had a law that
[1:20:18] they received a blessing? Listen what
[1:20:19] Moses said. He said, "It shall come to
[1:20:21] pass that thou shalt hearken diligently
[1:20:23] under the voice of the Lord thy God to
[1:20:26] observe and do his commandments that I I
[1:20:28] command thee this day, and the Lord thy
[1:20:30] God will set thee on high above all the
[1:20:32] nations of the earth. And all these
[1:20:35] blessings shall come upon thee and
[1:20:37] overtake thee, if thou shalt hearken
[1:20:39] unto the voice of the Lord thy God."
[1:20:42] See, so here, even them under the law.
[1:20:44] Here, this is what Moses saying. You're
[1:20:46] pursued by a curse. You've been pursued
[1:20:48] by a curse. You've been pursued by death
[1:20:50] from the time of your birth, you've been
[1:20:52] pursued by by this law of sin and death.
[1:20:55] But listen what Moses said. He said,
[1:20:56] "But the blessings of God shall come
[1:20:59] upon thee and overtake thee." Isn't that
[1:21:01] powerful? So here, what he tells us is
[1:21:03] that the curse ain't going to overtake
[1:21:04] you at all, but there's something else
[1:21:06] that's going to overtake you. It may
[1:21:08] pursue you. It may follow after you. It
[1:21:10] may torment you. It may torment your
[1:21:12] flesh. But he said, "But uh" He said,
[1:21:14] "But the blessings of God are going to
[1:21:16] overtake thee." You know what it means
[1:21:17] to overtake? It means that it would come
[1:21:20] suddenly and without warning. Don't you
[1:21:22] see what God is trying to do? That right
[1:21:24] in the middle of your purpose of your
[1:21:26] life. And you're following after the
[1:21:27] curse of this flesh. And you're
[1:21:29] following after the desire of sin and
[1:21:31] the desire of the flesh. And the and the
[1:21:33] and the curse is following after your
[1:21:35] life. And you're going down that path.
[1:21:36] Then all of a sudden, right when you
[1:21:38] least expect it, here comes a spirit of
[1:21:40] God and the blessing of God overtakes
[1:21:42] your life suddenly upon your life and
[1:21:46] takes you out of the curse of death into
[1:21:48] another law. You see what God's trying
[1:21:50] to do for you, friends? I tell you what,
[1:21:52] if there's that great of a blessing
[1:21:53] under the law, then what about us that
[1:21:55] ain't under the law?
[1:21:57] &gt;&gt; If under the law that the blessing can
[1:21:59] overtake you, then what about us that's
[1:22:01] been freed from the law that ain't
[1:22:02] bound? What about right now when we're
[1:22:04] not bound by the law of sin and death?
[1:22:06] For the Bible says Christ has redeemed
[1:22:08] us from the curse of the law. And he got
[1:22:10] he gave us a new law to live by. Not the
[1:22:13] law of sin and death, but it's the law
[1:22:15] of life.
[1:22:17] &gt;&gt; You see, if we're not guilty by our
[1:22:20] natural birth, we're guilty by not based
[1:22:23] on our actions. We're saved by spiritual
[1:22:25] birth, not based on our actions.
[1:22:27] &gt;&gt; What Adam did caused the fall. What
[1:22:29] Jesus did brought salvation. Isn't that
[1:22:31] powerful? So we war, we war with the
[1:22:34] flesh, wrestling in our mind trying to
[1:22:36] make peace with God. This is where Jacob
[1:22:38] was. He felt like a shackster because of
[1:22:41] his past and all the deception and he
[1:22:43] felt like a liar and he felt can you
[1:22:45] imagine? He felt like a deceiver and
[1:22:46] maybe through many years of his life all
[1:22:48] that had gone from him and he didn't
[1:22:50] think about it for a long time. But then
[1:22:52] when God told him it's time for you to
[1:22:53] go back home and Jacob starts this
[1:22:55] journey he's on it. Isn't that what we
[1:22:57] are? He's on his journey to the homeland
[1:22:59] here. And when he was on the journey
[1:23:00] home, he comes to this place and he
[1:23:02] finds out that that pursuer is there to
[1:23:04] meet him
[1:23:06] &gt;&gt; before he met his or reached his
[1:23:08] destination. In other words, his past
[1:23:10] had finally caught up with him.
[1:23:12] &gt;&gt; And here here when he would come to this
[1:23:15] place and he's he's calling out to God
[1:23:17] and he's waring with God all night long
[1:23:19] he wars with God and he's wrestling with
[1:23:21] God. And he the man said to him, "What
[1:23:23] is thy name?" He said, "My name is
[1:23:25] Jacob." He said, "Thy name shall no
[1:23:27] longer be called Jacob, but Israel. For
[1:23:30] as a prince hast thou power with God and
[1:23:32] with men, and thou hast prevailed." Now,
[1:23:34] isn't that something? You know what a
[1:23:36] prince is? It's a son of a king.
[1:23:38] &gt;&gt; And here in this night of prayer that
[1:23:40] God speaks to Jacob and calls him a
[1:23:43] prince. Can you imagine feeling like he
[1:23:45] did? I I I feel like a liar, but he
[1:23:48] said, "But I'm gonna call you a prince.
[1:23:50] I feel like a deceiver, but I'm going to
[1:23:52] call you prince. I I'm a shastra, but
[1:23:54] I'm going to call you prince."
[1:23:55] I'm look at my past. It's coming at me.
[1:23:57] But I'm going to call you prince. Even
[1:23:59] it didn't matter how Jacob felt here. He
[1:24:01] had a great fear. That's why he was
[1:24:03] warned with God. But God looked past all
[1:24:05] of his feelings and his emotions and all
[1:24:07] of his past and all the things that he
[1:24:08] had ever done wrong. And God looked at
[1:24:10] him. He said, "But I'm going to call you
[1:24:12] a prince, the son of a king."
[1:24:15] &gt;&gt; Charles Spurgeon would say like this. He
[1:24:17] said, "He that shall really spend a
[1:24:19] night in prayer shall win a celestial
[1:24:21] blessing. He shall lie down a Jacob, but
[1:24:25] he shall rise up a prince. Ain't that
[1:24:28] powerful? He shall lie down a liar, but
[1:24:30] he'll rise up a prince. The man that
[1:24:32] would spend a night in prayer, you may
[1:24:34] lay down a deceiver, but you'll rise up
[1:24:36] a believer. You may lay down a liar. You
[1:24:39] may lay down a sinner, but you're going
[1:24:41] to rise up a son of God and a prince of
[1:24:44] the kingdom of heaven.
[1:24:46] &gt;&gt; Lay down a liar, rise up a king.
[1:24:48] He said, "God came down and had a
[1:24:50] wrestling match and he stayed with God
[1:24:53] and he held on until the blessing come."
[1:24:56] &gt;&gt; See, I think that's what we need this
[1:24:57] morning.
[1:24:58] &gt;&gt; Sometimes you just need something to
[1:25:00] hold on to.
[1:25:01] &gt;&gt; See, you held on until the the blessing
[1:25:03] come. You got said, "Don't let go until
[1:25:05] a blessing comes." You know, you say,
[1:25:06] "Well, brother Matt, I'm sick. What do I
[1:25:08] do?" You take a hold of the promise. By
[1:25:10] his stripes, we are healed.
[1:25:12] &gt;&gt; And then you hold on to it until the
[1:25:14] blessing comes.
[1:25:15] &gt;&gt; See, it didn't matter how long it takes.
[1:25:17] is a God-given promise. So even if
[1:25:19] you're sick this morning, you could hold
[1:25:20] on to the promise of God. Say, "God, I'm
[1:25:22] not going to let go of it until I
[1:25:23] receive my blessing. I'm not." Well,
[1:25:25] God, if you want to heal me, you can. If
[1:25:26] you don't want to, I understand. But you
[1:25:28] hold on to it.
[1:25:30] &gt;&gt; Hold on to it. That's why he was
[1:25:31] wrestling with the Lord. He said, "I'm
[1:25:33] not going to let you go until I receive
[1:25:35] my blessing. It was your promise. You
[1:25:37] made me. You told me you'd be with me.
[1:25:39] You told me you'd keep me. You told me
[1:25:41] you'd bring me back to my homeland. I'm
[1:25:42] going to hold on to the promise and I'm
[1:25:44] not going to let go until I get my
[1:25:46] blessing.
[1:25:47] &gt;&gt; So, you got to take a hold of something.
[1:25:49] If you're down this morning, get a hold
[1:25:51] of the promise of the word of God. If
[1:25:52] you're depressed this morning, get a
[1:25:54] hold of the promise of the of the joy of
[1:25:57] the Lord. The Bible said, "Weeping may
[1:25:58] endure for a night, but joy cometh in
[1:26:01] the morning. Take a hold of the promise
[1:26:02] of God and hold on to it
[1:26:05] &gt;&gt; until you receive your blessing." Hold
[1:26:07] on to a scripture. Hold on to a
[1:26:09] testimony. Hold on to a move of God.
[1:26:11] Hold on to an outpouring of the spirit
[1:26:13] of God. And when you came into a a
[1:26:15] church meeting and saw deliverance and
[1:26:17] God delivered you at the altar, don't go
[1:26:19] back out and let the devil bring it back
[1:26:21] to you. You may see the same temptation.
[1:26:23] You may see the same symptom, but you
[1:26:25] look the devil in the eye and say, "But
[1:26:26] I've got something to hold on to. I met
[1:26:29] God at an altar and he delivered me that
[1:26:31] night and he blessed me and I'm going to
[1:26:33] hold on to it." Hold on until you get
[1:26:36] what you have need of. program said,
[1:26:38] "Lord, that the people might have
[1:26:40] something to hold just like Jacob and
[1:26:42] know it's the Holy Spirit and never turn
[1:26:44] it loose until they're blessed."
[1:26:46] &gt;&gt; Every sick person in here, if they'll
[1:26:48] take a hold of that same promise and
[1:26:50] stay right with it until they're assured
[1:26:51] in their heart that the blessing of God
[1:26:53] rest upon them, hold on to the
[1:26:56] scripture. Hold on to the promise. Hold
[1:26:58] on to the testimony. Whatever it is,
[1:27:02] hold on. Stay with God until the
[1:27:05] blessing comes. You say, "Well, brother
[1:27:07] man, I don't know about that." Let me
[1:27:09] tell you what the devil does. He's
[1:27:10] trying to get you to let go of it.
[1:27:12] &gt;&gt; Let go of your faith and let go of what
[1:27:14] you've been standing for. He wants to
[1:27:16] convince you to let go and give up and
[1:27:18] and to and to stop fighting. What's the
[1:27:20] use after all? Can you imagine that?
[1:27:22] Even even the Lord would ask that to
[1:27:23] Jacob. Won't you let go? Won't you turn
[1:27:25] me loose? What was he just test him?
[1:27:27] Won't you let go of it? Won't you won't
[1:27:28] you turn? But he wasn't willing to let
[1:27:30] it go because he wanted his blessing.
[1:27:32] So, Caesar, what's the use? God promised
[1:27:34] me healing and I'm still sick. What's
[1:27:36] the use? He promised I'd be free, but
[1:27:38] I'm still bound. What's the use? He
[1:27:39] promised he'd be a guide, but but I but
[1:27:42] I can't get no no direction. He He
[1:27:44] promised a new birth, and he promised a
[1:27:45] new life, but I'm still struggling with
[1:27:47] this old flesh.
[1:27:49] &gt;&gt; Hold on to the promise
[1:27:51] &gt;&gt; till you receive the blessing. Stay with
[1:27:53] God and hold on to it till the blessing
[1:27:55] comes.
[1:27:56] &gt;&gt; See, God has promised a blessing to the
[1:27:59] church. How many believe that?
[1:28:01] &gt;&gt; He's promised us a blessing. But says,
[1:28:02] see, said, "What is our blessing?" He
[1:28:04] said, "The new birth that changes a man,
[1:28:06] it changes a woman, it changes a new
[1:28:08] desire, it changes their appetite."
[1:28:10] Wrestle with God until you can hold on
[1:28:14] until the blessing comes. And then God
[1:28:15] will change you like he did Jacob
[1:28:18] &gt;&gt; from a suppler to a prince.
[1:28:21] &gt;&gt; He would lay down,
[1:28:23] &gt;&gt; a suppler
[1:28:24] &gt;&gt; and rise up a prince.
[1:28:26] &gt;&gt; Lay down a Jacob and rise up a prince.
[1:28:29] And so stay with God until you receive
[1:28:32] your blessing. You realize that's what
[1:28:33] God is trying to bring us to. He brings
[1:28:35] you to a new birth. He brings you, this
[1:28:37] is the blessing of God that comes upon
[1:28:39] your life. Says, "So stay with God and
[1:28:41] stay with the word and stay with the
[1:28:43] promise of God." Listen, listen what the
[1:28:45] Bible says. And Jacob asked him, he
[1:28:46] said, "Tell me, I pray thee thy name."
[1:28:48] And he said, "Wherefore is it thou that
[1:28:51] dust ask after my name?" And the Bible
[1:28:53] said, "And he blessed him there."
[1:28:55] &gt;&gt; See, he held on for the West till he
[1:28:57] received his blessing. And when God saw
[1:29:00] that Jacob wasn't going to turn it
[1:29:01] loose, it was a promise and he that that
[1:29:03] he had received from God and he wasn't
[1:29:05] going to turn it loose, he said right
[1:29:07] then and there, he received his
[1:29:09] blessing. You realize what God's waiting
[1:29:11] on? He's waiting on you to hold on to
[1:29:12] the promise that it didn't matter how
[1:29:14] long the night was. He endured all night
[1:29:16] holding on to the promise of God. He
[1:29:18] endured the darkness of the age or the
[1:29:20] darkness of the hour. Friends, I don't
[1:29:22] know how long your night has been that
[1:29:24] you've been holding on to a God-given
[1:29:26] promise. But I say this tonight as an
[1:29:28] encouragement to you, you keep holding
[1:29:30] to the promise of God. And don't turn it
[1:29:32] loose. For the Bible says because he
[1:29:34] didn't let go that God blessed him
[1:29:36] there.
[1:29:37] &gt;&gt; Even in the middle of the night, he
[1:29:39] blessed him there.
[1:29:41] &gt;&gt; There's coming an end to the nighttime.
[1:29:43] There's coming an end to the darkness
[1:29:44] that's overshadowed your life. There
[1:29:46] comes an end to darkness. Darkness don't
[1:29:48] last forever. It only lasts until the
[1:29:50] dawn. But before the daybreak, he
[1:29:51] received his blessing that when he would
[1:29:53] get up in the morning, he was a brand
[1:29:55] new man. Everything had changed about
[1:29:57] his life. I don't care how long you've
[1:29:59] been sick or how long you've been down
[1:30:01] or how long you've been toiling and
[1:30:02] laboring and battling. Let me tell you,
[1:30:04] friends, there's an end of every night.
[1:30:06] And there's always a new day. And in the
[1:30:09] new day, Jacob rose up as a blessed man.
[1:30:13] Let me tell you, he said he blessed them
[1:30:15] there. Let me tell you something
[1:30:16] powerful about this blessing of God that
[1:30:18] when Jacob got up and he had a hold of
[1:30:20] this blessing. You know what? On the
[1:30:21] outside, you couldn't even tell anything
[1:30:23] that would have happened. When Jacob
[1:30:25] walked up, they don't know what happened
[1:30:26] when he came up to his friends. Well, he
[1:30:28] and nothing had changed. The
[1:30:30] circumstances are still the same. Esau
[1:30:32] was still coming. Hello, somebody. You
[1:30:34] know what it's like when you kneel down
[1:30:35] in an altar and you give your heart to
[1:30:36] God and you and you and and and you you
[1:30:38] come in there and labor before the Lord
[1:30:40] and the spirit of God comes and fills
[1:30:42] your heart and you go back out out out
[1:30:44] just ready to shout, "Thank God for
[1:30:46] deliverance." And you walk out the doors
[1:30:47] and the world hits you right in the
[1:30:49] face. It don't matter if it took six
[1:30:50] months to get out of it. When you walk
[1:30:52] out the doors, it don't take just a
[1:30:54] moment, just a smell, just a memory,
[1:30:56] just a thought. And what is Satan is
[1:30:58] doing? He's coming and tempting you
[1:31:00] right back into the very thing that God
[1:31:01] brought you out of.
[1:31:03] said he's always there. Esau was still
[1:31:06] across the brook. He was still waiting
[1:31:08] on him,
[1:31:09] &gt;&gt; but he was blessed.
[1:31:11] &gt;&gt; His death was still coming to meet him,
[1:31:13] but he was blessed. The curse was still
[1:31:15] on the other side of the brook, but he
[1:31:16] was blessed. It didn't matter. Jacob
[1:31:18] said, "I I don't know what's going to
[1:31:19] happen, but I know one thing. I have
[1:31:21] been blessed." And he walked along with
[1:31:24] his family. Well, something's changed
[1:31:26] about me. Well, I can't say nothing
[1:31:27] different about you. You look like the
[1:31:29] same man, but I've been blessed to God.
[1:31:31] You still you still were you still look
[1:31:33] the same way you did but I've been
[1:31:34] blessed of God. I I I don't see
[1:31:36] anything's changed. You might not see it
[1:31:38] on the outside but something took place
[1:31:40] on the inside and one day it'll manifest
[1:31:42] on the flesh.
[1:31:45] &gt;&gt; He changed me. The blessing that God put
[1:31:48] upon him. Think about it. The Bible says
[1:31:51] that finally whenever Jacob comes in
[1:31:53] contact with Esau that Esau ran and he
[1:31:57] greeted his brother. All this that he
[1:32:00] had been afraid of. He kissed him and
[1:32:02] greeted him and loved him. All this
[1:32:04] afraid afraid of this meeting and really
[1:32:07] said there God delivered him from the
[1:32:10] curse of Esau.
[1:32:12] &gt;&gt; Isn't that powerful that we have a curse
[1:32:16] that has been upon our life but a night
[1:32:18] of prayer delivered him from the curse.
[1:32:21] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:32:22] &gt;&gt; You see, but you realize you think about
[1:32:24] our blessing tonight. Our blessing is
[1:32:26] far greater than just living a
[1:32:30] comfortable life. People's always
[1:32:31] looking for a blessing. I'm going to
[1:32:32] pray till God gives me a blessing. But
[1:32:34] the problem is people's looking for the
[1:32:36] wrong kind of blessing.
[1:32:37] &gt;&gt; I'm going to pray till God gives me a
[1:32:40] a big blessing or something, you know,
[1:32:42] but but it's not about living a
[1:32:44] comfortable life or or being or even I'm
[1:32:47] just going to my blessing is my healing
[1:32:49] of of a sickness. That that ain't even
[1:32:51] the blessing. That that's a that's a
[1:32:52] that's an extra part and that's nice.
[1:32:54] But but but our blessing is far greater
[1:32:57] than just to be able to receive things
[1:32:59] in this natural life to make this
[1:33:00] natural life easier or or or better to
[1:33:03] get through. And but our our blessing is
[1:33:05] far more than that. You you can see this
[1:33:07] in the Bible in the last supper Matthew
[1:33:10] the 26th chapter. The Bible said as they
[1:33:12] were eating Jesus took the bread and he
[1:33:14] blessed it and he broke it and he gave
[1:33:16] it to the disciples and and he said take
[1:33:18] and eat for this is my body. And he took
[1:33:21] the cup and he gave thanks and he gave
[1:33:22] it to them saying, "Drink you all of it.
[1:33:25] This is my blood of the new testament
[1:33:27] which is shed for many for the remission
[1:33:29] of sins. This do you in remembrance of
[1:33:32] me." So we see that the communion with
[1:33:34] the Lord was to remember the
[1:33:37] crucifixion. Jesus says this is a
[1:33:38] commission that he gave to the church or
[1:33:40] do this in remembrance of me. It's what
[1:33:42] we do just like water baptism. It's
[1:33:43] something that that we continue to do.
[1:33:46] It was a commission that God gave us.
[1:33:47] Jesus. So, so, so it's to remember the
[1:33:49] crucifixion. And you know that
[1:33:51] regardless of of of any denomination,
[1:33:53] regardless if you're a Protestant or
[1:33:55] regardless if you're Catholic, you know
[1:33:57] that that's something that almost
[1:33:58] everybody does. The majority of the
[1:34:01] world takes communion. It's the it's the
[1:34:03] majority of all. They they they actually
[1:34:05] uh fulfill this very this very action of
[1:34:08] taking uh communion. So, so we realize
[1:34:10] that they all have done it, but what
[1:34:12] they have done is made a tra a tradition
[1:34:14] out of it or a law out of it. And it's
[1:34:16] not and and you make it to where this is
[1:34:18] really the Lord's body. And when you
[1:34:20] take this, you're eating the Lord's
[1:34:21] body. But but really, it wasn't nothing
[1:34:22] like that at all. See, because what
[1:34:24] communion really means is communion
[1:34:26] means to share the intimate thoughts or
[1:34:29] the feelings with someone. See, so
[1:34:31] that's the real communion that God is
[1:34:33] wanting to have with the church. And so,
[1:34:35] so they've made a tradition out of it.
[1:34:36] They have communion on the first Sunday,
[1:34:38] you know, whatever different ones have.
[1:34:41] But but but it becomes such a tradition
[1:34:42] and such a ritual in the church. And
[1:34:45] then and and and that whenever you would
[1:34:46] go through the act of communion, there's
[1:34:48] really no communion that takes place at
[1:34:50] all.
[1:34:51] &gt;&gt; They they they drink bread or or or wine
[1:34:53] and eat bread, but there's no communion
[1:34:55] that takes place. And so we we see this
[1:34:57] in the scripture where communion
[1:34:58] actually came from. It didn't it didn't
[1:35:00] come from Israel, but it came all the
[1:35:02] way back from Abraham when he met
[1:35:03] Melazdc. Remember when Abraham went and
[1:35:05] he battled? That's ringing up there,
[1:35:07] brother. I don't know if y'all can hear
[1:35:08] it, but but it's about to get me. But
[1:35:10] when Abraham went to uh met Melazdc and
[1:35:12] he went to battle against the four kings
[1:35:14] that had taken Lot captive and the Bible
[1:35:16] says Abraham took the the a trained
[1:35:19] servants or trained servants and brought
[1:35:21] back Lot and brought back the people and
[1:35:23] and all the goods and he brought them
[1:35:25] all back and restored them. Remember the
[1:35:26] kings that came into Sodom and destroyed
[1:35:28] Sodom. But Abraham had went and he
[1:35:30] fought and he wared to bring back what
[1:35:32] belonged to him. He he he took
[1:35:34] possession of what belonged to him.
[1:35:36] said, "See, and when he brought it back
[1:35:37] on his way back, he met Melazedc." And
[1:35:40] now you say, "Now notice what was it
[1:35:41] that Melazdc met when he or gave Abraham
[1:35:44] when he met him, notice the Bible said
[1:35:46] Melazdc gave him bread, wine, and a
[1:35:49] blessing." He said, "I'll I'll share
[1:35:51] with you bread and wine." He said, "But
[1:35:52] also blessed uh he blessed him. Blessed
[1:35:55] be the Abram of the most high God,
[1:35:57] possessor of the heaven and earth." But
[1:35:58] Ram said, notice after the battle was
[1:36:00] over, Melazdc served his victorious
[1:36:03] child communion. said think of that part
[1:36:05] of himself. He said now what we want to
[1:36:07] see here in type here is in the view of
[1:36:09] communion that after the battle he gave
[1:36:12] of himself because the communion is part
[1:36:14] of Christ and after the struggle is over
[1:36:17] after you've done got yourself whipped
[1:36:19] out then is when you partake of Christ
[1:36:21] and you become a part of his being. You
[1:36:24] realize that's the same thing that Jacob
[1:36:26] was doing. You see what the real
[1:36:27] blessing is? It wasn't that God would
[1:36:29] give him lands or that God would give
[1:36:31] him uh some great reward in this life.
[1:36:34] He said, "But Jacob wrestled all night
[1:36:36] and he wouldn't turn him loose until he
[1:36:38] blessed him." He said he battled for
[1:36:40] life. But after his battle was over,
[1:36:42] then God gives you of himself. That is
[1:36:45] his true communion. That little bread
[1:36:48] and that wafer, it just represents it.
[1:36:50] You shouldn't take it unless you've
[1:36:51] wrestled it out and become a part of
[1:36:53] God. Say, see, so that's what God's
[1:36:55] waiting on. He's waiting on somebody
[1:36:57] that'll wrestle out all night long.
[1:36:59] That'll wrestle out the things of the
[1:37:00] world and wrestle out the flesh.
[1:37:02] Friends, it may be a long weary night,
[1:37:04] but we're wrestling with God and holding
[1:37:06] on to the promise of God that we can
[1:37:08] take a hold of a part of him.
[1:37:11] &gt;&gt; Lord, I want a part of you. This is what
[1:37:13] the wrestling is about. The blessing
[1:37:14] wasn't monetary things, but the blessing
[1:37:16] was to have a part of God in his life.
[1:37:20] &gt;&gt; You think of all the traditions of
[1:37:22] Israel, the great feast of Judaism. I I
[1:37:24] don't have time to to go through it this
[1:37:26] morning, but but but but you know you
[1:37:28] know what they are in in the the feast
[1:37:29] of the Passover, the feast of unleaven
[1:37:31] bread, the the the the feast of
[1:37:33] Pentecost, you know, in the time of
[1:37:35] Jubilee, the feast of trumpets when they
[1:37:37] would they would come and and remember
[1:37:40] these feasts were a remembrance of the
[1:37:42] things that God had done for them in
[1:37:44] their ancestral history. And so here it
[1:37:46] it would the feast of atonement. This
[1:37:48] was the day that the only time the day
[1:37:51] of the year that the high priest could
[1:37:53] go into the holies of holies that would
[1:37:56] be able to intercede for uh for the
[1:37:58] people. You see when you when you go
[1:38:00] through these feasts, you see as Jesus
[1:38:02] actually fulfilled these and he became
[1:38:04] the high priest that that we could
[1:38:05] access. He he became the the sound of
[1:38:08] freedom. Remember the gospel was a
[1:38:10] sounding of freedom. He became the
[1:38:11] trumpet that was sounded the in this
[1:38:14] age. It was Christ. Even even the feast
[1:38:16] of tabernacles when when they would go
[1:38:18] out and they even today they'll build
[1:38:20] booths to go out and they'll have dinner
[1:38:22] in the booth outside away from their
[1:38:24] house to remember when they lived out in
[1:38:26] the wilderness and had to travel in
[1:38:27] tents. But we see that Christ even done
[1:38:29] that very thing that it would be Christ
[1:38:32] tabernacling himself in humanity not not
[1:38:34] in the holies of holies. So we see all
[1:38:37] of these all of these feasts that comes
[1:38:39] down to Christ's relationship with the
[1:38:41] church. the feast of atonement, even the
[1:38:43] feast of Passover. But notice in this
[1:38:46] Jewish feast of Passover, I'm g I'm
[1:38:48] gonna close just a minute. But in this
[1:38:49] Jewish feast of Passover, this
[1:38:51] celebration is what was taking place. It
[1:38:54] was it it it uses unleavened bread and
[1:38:57] wine. So the feast of Passover is to sit
[1:39:00] and to break bread and take of the bread
[1:39:02] and take of the wine. But whenever they
[1:39:04] sit down and partake of this, it's not
[1:39:06] communion at all. There never was a such
[1:39:08] a thing as communion until after the
[1:39:10] death of Jesus Christ. So some thousands
[1:39:13] of years later after that Melkazedc had
[1:39:15] melt Abraham. That's the first time we
[1:39:17] ever see people partake of communion.
[1:39:20] But all this time from the time of Moses
[1:39:22] until the time of Jesus. Still yet they
[1:39:25] parttook of wine and bread. It just
[1:39:27] wasn't called communion. They come
[1:39:28] together. It was the feast of Passover.
[1:39:31] It was a symbol of when they came out of
[1:39:33] Egypt and the and the and the death
[1:39:34] angel had came over Egypt. Remember, the
[1:39:37] Bible told them to make sure when you
[1:39:38] put when you bake the bread, don't put
[1:39:40] any leaven in the bread because we're
[1:39:42] going to have to leave quickly. So, it
[1:39:43] it can't be leaven bread. We don't have
[1:39:45] time to wait on the bread to rise. We
[1:39:47] got to be able to take the bread and go
[1:39:49] go into the wilderness. And so, that
[1:39:51] night when the death angel passed over,
[1:39:52] they put blood on the door. And the
[1:39:54] death angel, it took all of the
[1:39:55] firstborn of Egypt, but in the house of
[1:39:57] Israel, it didn't touch any of the
[1:39:59] children. So all this time they had
[1:40:02] commemorated that very event or the
[1:40:04] passing over of the death angel. And so
[1:40:06] when they have this feast of the
[1:40:08] Passover, it's to commemorate that very
[1:40:10] happening. So they sit down and they eat
[1:40:12] of the unleven bread and they drink of
[1:40:14] the wine and they're remembering this
[1:40:16] event. You realize that so it's a
[1:40:18] symbolism of their freedom from slavery
[1:40:20] out of Egypt. It had nothing to do with
[1:40:22] the blood or the body of Jesus Christ.
[1:40:25] And you realize that this was the feast
[1:40:27] that Jesus was setting in when he was
[1:40:30] having the last supper with the
[1:40:31] disciples.
[1:40:32] &gt;&gt; It was at the feast of Passover. So here
[1:40:35] they were setting. Jesus and the
[1:40:36] disciples were not the only ones having
[1:40:38] a supper that night. All of Israel was
[1:40:40] having a supper. They all had wine and
[1:40:43] they all had bread because they were
[1:40:45] remembering what had taken place. This
[1:40:47] had been going on for many years. They
[1:40:49] were remembering what had taken place.
[1:40:51] But when Jesus takes a hold of the bread
[1:40:53] and wine, he he tells them what really
[1:40:55] communion really is. He said this bread
[1:40:57] and the wine has another meaning. It
[1:41:00] it's far greater than Moses. It isn't
[1:41:02] just about God's children coming out of
[1:41:04] the land of Egypt, but this come all the
[1:41:06] way back from the time that Melazdc came
[1:41:08] and met Abraham. He took them to a
[1:41:10] deeper walk with him. You remember when
[1:41:12] God came and he dwelt with man and God
[1:41:15] gave a part of himself and he sat down
[1:41:17] with his son Abraham. They were all
[1:41:19] children of Abraham. Amen.
[1:41:21] &gt;&gt; But Jesus said, "You take of this bread
[1:41:23] and you eat of it, for it is my body."
[1:41:25] What was he telling them? I am that same
[1:41:26] one that walked with Abraham. It is I
[1:41:29] that w that break bread with Abraham and
[1:41:31] drank wine with Abraham and gave a
[1:41:33] blessed unto him. He sat right in their
[1:41:35] midst. He said, "This is my body and
[1:41:37] this cup of wine is my blood. Drink it
[1:41:39] and do this in remembrance of me."
[1:41:42] &gt;&gt; He was showing the disciples that the
[1:41:43] bread and the wine was not just a
[1:41:45] tradition of Israel, but it had came
[1:41:47] long before Moses. He showed the real
[1:41:49] meaning of it. Abraham had bread and
[1:41:52] wine and a blessing.
[1:41:54] &gt;&gt; And now when Jesus is sitting at the
[1:41:56] table now, the disciples had bread and
[1:41:59] wine.
[1:42:00] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:42:00] &gt;&gt; And we're waiting on a blessing.
[1:42:02] &gt;&gt; You said, "Well, when did their blessing
[1:42:03] come?" Well, can I just tell you? I
[1:42:05] don't have time to get there.
[1:42:07] &gt;&gt; The Bible said when the day of Pentecost
[1:42:08] was fully come,
[1:42:10] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[1:42:10] &gt;&gt; And the spirit of God poured down out in
[1:42:12] the upper room that he broke himself
[1:42:14] into little licks of fire. that great
[1:42:16] pillar of fire, he broke off into little
[1:42:18] licks of fire and he gave each one of
[1:42:20] them a part of himself. But Ram said he
[1:42:23] separated himself when he come down on
[1:42:25] that day of Pentecost. He separated
[1:42:27] himself in tongues of fire, that pillar
[1:42:29] of fire and he scattered through the
[1:42:30] church and set upon each of them. It was
[1:42:33] God dividing himself among his church.
[1:42:36] He said at that day you'll know that I
[1:42:38] am in the father and the father in me
[1:42:40] and I in you. He said that's what
[1:42:42] Pentecost is. That's the real blessing.
[1:42:44] It's having a part of God.
[1:42:47] &gt;&gt; It's taking a part of God and consuming
[1:42:50] it into your life. Friends, I don't know
[1:42:51] about you, but they were in that upper
[1:42:53] room. They were praying. They were
[1:42:55] waring all night. They were in fear for
[1:42:57] their lives. They they didn't know what
[1:42:58] they were what was going to happen. They
[1:43:00] locked themselves in the upper room.
[1:43:01] They prayed all night waiting on God.
[1:43:03] And all of a sudden, the blessing of God
[1:43:06] overtook them.
[1:43:07] &gt;&gt; It took them out of their own flesh. I
[1:43:09] don't know what they thought about doing
[1:43:11] the next day, but when they were
[1:43:12] overtaken by the blessing of God, they
[1:43:14] came out of that uproar, but they'd been
[1:43:16] filled with a new wine. It's a blessing
[1:43:18] of the Holy Ghost.
[1:43:20] &gt;&gt; Abraham had bread and wine and a
[1:43:23] blessing. The disciples fed on bread and
[1:43:25] wine and a blessing. Said, "But what
[1:43:27] about the believer today?" You realize
[1:43:29] that that same blessing that they
[1:43:31] received, which was the Holy Ghost, is
[1:43:33] the same blessing that you receive
[1:43:34] today.
[1:43:36] &gt;&gt; But that's not all of it. That blessing
[1:43:38] is just a taste
[1:43:40] &gt;&gt; of the real thing.
[1:43:41] &gt;&gt; It's a little portion of it. See, but
[1:43:44] Melazdc after his child Abraham had won
[1:43:47] the victory as the music players want to
[1:43:49] come. Abraham had won the victory.
[1:43:51] Melazedc met him and gave him wine and
[1:43:54] bread. Showing that after this earthly
[1:43:57] battle is over, we will meet him in the
[1:43:59] heavens and take communion again. Said
[1:44:02] it'll be a wedding supper.
[1:44:03] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:44:04] &gt;&gt; Now, isn't that wonderful this morning
[1:44:06] to think of? Isn't that what Jesus said
[1:44:07] when he passed the bread and wine? He
[1:44:10] said, "I will drink no more of the vine
[1:44:11] or eat of the fruit until I eat and
[1:44:13] drink it with you a new in my father's
[1:44:15] kingdom."
[1:44:16] &gt;&gt; Says, "So he'll there's coming a day
[1:44:18] when we'll have a real supper with him."
[1:44:20] There's coming a day said when we'll
[1:44:22] we'll have that wedding supper. He said,
[1:44:24] "What a beautiful time that it is that
[1:44:26] Melazdc met Abraham." You think of this.
[1:44:29] I I don't I don't have time to preach
[1:44:31] this. I'm just but but Melchazdc met
[1:44:33] Abraham before he got back home but
[1:44:37] after the battle says so he had fought a
[1:44:40] battle he was on his way home and that's
[1:44:42] where he met with him to have communion
[1:44:44] he gave him wine and bread and put a
[1:44:46] blessing upon his life a blessing that
[1:44:49] would ultimately leave lead Abraham
[1:44:51] right back to his home he said that's
[1:44:54] the same thing with us said he meant
[1:44:56] before he got home after the battle he
[1:44:58] said we're going to meet Jesus in the
[1:45:00] air before we get home.
[1:45:02] &gt;&gt; But one day after the battle is over, on
[1:45:04] our way home, we're going to meet him in
[1:45:06] the air and we're going to have a real
[1:45:08] wedding supper,
[1:45:09] &gt;&gt; have a real communion with mec just like
[1:45:12] Abraham done. That's what Paul said. He
[1:45:13] said, "We which are alive and remain
[1:45:15] shall not prevent. Those that are
[1:45:16] asleep, for the trump of God shall
[1:45:18] sound, and the dead in Christ shall rise
[1:45:19] first. And we which are alive and remain
[1:45:22] shall be caught up together with them to
[1:45:24] meet the Lord in the air."
[1:45:26] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:45:26] &gt;&gt; Won't you stand to your feet this
[1:45:28] morning?
[1:45:29] We keep fighting the fight of faith.
[1:45:33] Say, "Brother Matt, what are we
[1:45:34] fighting?" Because we're going to endure
[1:45:37] until the end, till the blessing of God
[1:45:39] comes upon your life.
[1:45:43] How many believes that this morning?
[1:45:44] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:45:45] &gt;&gt; You believe there's a crown of glory
[1:45:46] that awaits you?
[1:45:48] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:45:48] &gt;&gt; There's a crown that awaits you as a
[1:45:50] believer. How many believes that? Won't
[1:45:52] you raise your hand? You There's a crown
[1:45:54] that that awaits you. It ain't This life
[1:45:55] isn't your reward. you you look around
[1:45:58] this life and the things you have. The
[1:46:00] biggest trick the devil I'm just going
[1:46:01] to give you something free. But the
[1:46:02] biggest trick the devil can do to you is
[1:46:05] to make you feel like God isn't doing
[1:46:06] nothing for you and cause you to look
[1:46:09] around at other people and see the
[1:46:10] things they have and what they've done
[1:46:11] and say, "Well, God does something for
[1:46:13] him. God don't do nothing for me." And
[1:46:15] see, God ain't doing nothing for you.
[1:46:16] But this isn't even what your blessing
[1:46:18] is.
[1:46:19] &gt;&gt; This don't mean that this is a few days.
[1:46:21] What's a few days in the middle of
[1:46:24] eternity?
[1:46:25] &gt;&gt; A real blessing of eternal life. And
[1:46:27] we're worried about a few days, things
[1:46:30] that'll happen and be gone and a few. We
[1:46:31] don't even have a promise of tomorrow.
[1:46:33] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:46:33] &gt;&gt; In a few days and nothing you ever gain
[1:46:35] in this life. The Bible calls it hay and
[1:46:37] stubble.
[1:46:39] &gt;&gt; It ain't nothing that you'll ever take
[1:46:40] with you. It'll burn.
[1:46:42] So whatever we have in this life, I
[1:46:44] thank God for what I have. I thank God
[1:46:46] for what you have and what God does for
[1:46:48] us. But that ain't really our blessing.
[1:46:51] Our blessing is an eternal life.
[1:46:54] &gt;&gt; To have a part of God. Friends, let me
[1:46:56] tell you this. This is a gospel truth.
[1:46:58] You can be the poorest person on earth
[1:47:01] and have the part of God and be the
[1:47:03] richest man in the world. That's really
[1:47:06] what that's really what wealth is. Is to
[1:47:08] be able to have a part of God. The very
[1:47:10] creator of heaven, a a father that owns
[1:47:12] a cattle on a thousand heels. It isn't
[1:47:14] possessions that you can that you can
[1:47:16] gain in this life. It's having a real
[1:47:18] relationship with God.
[1:47:19] &gt;&gt; Amen. being able to feed upon upon
[1:47:23] Christ, the word of God. We have a crown
[1:47:26] that's waiting on us. Won't you bow your
[1:47:28] head this morning?
[1:47:30] I wonder how many you may raise your
[1:47:32] hand, say, "Brother Matt, I I've been
[1:47:34] waring. I've been fighting that fight of
[1:47:36] faith." God bless you for being honest.
[1:47:38] Brothers, sisters, God bless y'all all
[1:47:40] over the building. I've been fighting.
[1:47:41] I've been waring. It's been a long
[1:47:43] night.
[1:47:44] I just need a breakthrough. You know, we
[1:47:47] go through that many times in our life.
[1:47:49] We'll have revivals and then we'll we'll
[1:47:51] go through some dark times. You say,
[1:47:53] "What is it? Is Satan trying to keep you
[1:47:55] out of out of a move of God? He tries to
[1:47:57] discourage you." But friends, the
[1:47:59] reality is we're sons and daughters of
[1:48:00] God. And at the end of the night, you're
[1:48:03] going to receive your blessing. And I
[1:48:06] come to tell you this this morning that
[1:48:07] the night is over. If anybody here that
[1:48:10] would receive that this morning, you've
[1:48:12] been waiting and you've been calling,
[1:48:13] you've been holding on. You say,
[1:48:14] "Brother man, I need a I need a move of
[1:48:16] God in my life. The night is over."
[1:48:17] where you've held on long enough. Say,
[1:48:19] "God, I'm not going to let loose." I
[1:48:21] wonder how many will accept the night
[1:48:23] and lift your hand and say, "Lord, let
[1:48:25] me take a hold of it. The night has
[1:48:27] ended." Take a hold of the promise of
[1:48:29] God. What is thy name?
[1:48:33] Said, "What do you ask me in my name
[1:48:34] for?" And he blessed them there.
[1:48:38] Gracious heavenly father,
[1:48:41] Lord, to see your spirit moving around
[1:48:43] this building this morning.
[1:48:45] the blessing of our heavenly father,
[1:48:48] Lord, that is ministering to the hearts
[1:48:49] of your children,
[1:48:52] God, even right here this morning, Lord.
[1:48:54] God, we're not waiting on a blessing to
[1:48:56] come, but God, you said that you blessed
[1:48:58] him right where he was. And God, I ask
[1:49:01] you this morning, Lord, that you would
[1:49:02] pour your blessing out upon this church.
[1:49:05] God, every hand, Lord, that is raised,
[1:49:06] Lord. Maybe there's some that have lost
[1:49:08] their zeal, Lord. They they've been
[1:49:10] fighting their long battle, Lord. God, I
[1:49:14] just ask you tonight, Lord. God, that
[1:49:16] you would give them such a such a
[1:49:18] strength, God, that you would encourage
[1:49:20] them, Lord, in the word of God. Lord,
[1:49:22] may this word be an encouragement to
[1:49:23] them, Lord. May you pour your spirit out
[1:49:25] upon them, Lord. May they have a
[1:49:26] spiritual blessing this morning, God. We
[1:49:29] just thank you for moving among the
[1:49:31] church. Lord, we thank you for all you
[1:49:32] do. In Jesus Christ's name we pray.
[1:49:38] Amen. You love the Lord this morning.
[1:49:40] [Music]
[1:49:41] Amen. And isn't he wonderful?
[1:49:43] [Music]
[1:49:47] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:49:49] [Music]
[1:49:52] If the world from you withhold
[1:49:56] of its sealed silver and it's gold
[1:50:01] and you have to get along in meager
[1:50:06] faith.
[1:50:09] Just remember in his word
[1:50:13] how he feeds the little bird.
[1:50:17] Take your burdens
[1:50:19] to the Lord
[1:50:21] and leave it there.
[1:50:26] Leave it there.
[1:50:30] Leave it there.
[1:50:34] Take your burdens to the Lord and leave
[1:50:39] it there.
[1:50:43] If you trust and never doubt, he will
[1:50:48] surely bring you out. Take your burdens
[1:50:53] to the Lord and leave it there.
[1:50:59] If your body suffers pain
[1:51:03] and your health you can't regain
[1:51:07] and your soul is almost sinking in
[1:51:11] despair.
[1:51:15] Jesus knows the pain that you feel he
[1:51:20] can save and he still heals. So take
[1:51:24] your burdens to the Lord and leave it
[1:51:28] there.
[1:51:32] Leave it there.
[1:51:36] Leave it there.
[1:51:38] [Music]
[1:51:40] Take your burdens to the Lord and leave
[1:51:44] it there.
[1:51:48] If you trust and never die, he will
[1:51:52] surely bring you out. Take your burdens
[1:51:57] to the Lord and leave it there.
[1:52:01] You know the son of a slave wrote this
[1:52:03] song. When your youthful days are done
[1:52:07] and old age is stealing on
[1:52:11] and your body bends beneath the weight
[1:52:14] of care.
[1:52:18] He will never leave you then. He'll go
[1:52:22] with you to the end. Take your burdens
[1:52:27] to the Lord and leave it there.
[1:52:32] Leave it there.
[1:52:36] Leave it there.
