come together in the unity of the word of god there's something special about it it means god's going to move amen you know what the bible says when those 120 gathered in the upper room they were in one mind and in one accord and the holy ghost fell upon me i'm friends i'm going to tell you tonight we're here in one mind at one accord ain't nobody has an agenda we all come here to receive sir how

this this evening and lord i pray that you would just make yourself known lord in a special way lord god we know god that lord for us to speak that'd be one thing but if you just speak one word lord

together we ask it humbly in jesus name amen amen you love the lord this evening amen just good to see each one of you amen we're certainly honored to be here and i appreciate brother matt sister sarah and all the different ones all the hospitality and look out and i see a lot of familiar faces and then you know a lot of these kids though and when i first came out here they were little babies and now they're growing up and getting married and things like that but i guess somebody asked me if i felt old and i said no i don't until i see look at one of my children then i feel old but uh i tell you god's been good to us and amen i appreciate all the prayers for my wife's brother i did get a report today he's doing something better so we thank god for that and i know god don't start nothing he don't finish so amen i just believe that he's going to completely uh heal him and just make him well and even though they don't know for sure certain what the problem is i know that god knows all things amen so we appreciate the prayers amen god bless you if you take your bibles tonight we'll try to get right into the word if you turn with us to the book of romans and we'll be reading from the 11th chapter of romans i'd like to say i certainly enjoyed service last night amen and i know you all did and brother brother david just done an outstanding job and i really just uh so encouraged and strengthened by that amen i thank god for his grace amen i'm reminded what brother brown said there in perfect faith he said i was nothing when he found me he said i'm still nothing but i'm in his hands amen and i tell you it just shows the love of god and the prophet said and wouldn't our love reach back to him amen to realize that if he could love us when we were unlovable wouldn't our love reach back to him amen and i just love the lord tonight romans 11 verse 33 the bible says all the depth of the riches both of the wisdom and knowledge of god how unsearchable are his judgments and his ways past finding out for who hath known the mind of the lord or who hath been his counselor or who hath first given to him and it shall be recompensed unto him again for of him and through him and to him are all things to whom be glory forever amen and when god had his blessings you can have your seats tonight i'd like to take from from that portion of scripture tonight and and just speak to you for the next few minutes on divine intelligence and i believe that there's an intelligence behind everything that we see and you know i know that you know today they try to tell us that you know that this world just come to be you know it just it just kind of happened but but i i personally believe that there was an intelligence behind it and it was it was a god that had to have the power to create a world and and i i believe that it was an intelligent design and even we are here you know and the prophet the prophet of god said and i hope it's all right if i quote a prophet if it ain't all right i'm gonna do it anyway but amen but i just can't help it amen but you know the prophet said he said when i look at a tree he said i see a tree how pretty it is i see it as it goes down another one comes up in his place perpetual life and i think of that but somewhere that tree had a beginning see it had to have a beginning the only way it could be designated to be a tree or to be an oak or a beech tree or popular or a palm or or whatever it was there had to be a master intelligence behind it see some great master intelligence had to set it in order he said oh blessed be his name he's the one who sets the moon and the stars in the solar system he said everything in his order and he'll set the church in order amen there in the church age book just to lay a foundation the prophet said let me inject this thought in here even your natural birth is based upon election amen the female ovaries produce many many eggs but why is it that a certain at a certain time a certain egg comes down and not another one or amongst all the male sperm for no known reason a certain germ attaches itself to that egg while others could have just as easily attached themselves or had a better opportunity to do so but but did not and perish see there's an intelligence behind all this otherwise what determines whether the baby is going to be a boy or a girl or blonde or brunette or light or dark or what color of eyes it's going to have how tall it's going to be and you know i i know this bunch out here today was would like to tell us that that's your choice you know whether you're a boy or a girl you can make your own mind up about that but but i'm one that believes that that choice has already been made even that decision has already been made and it wasn't you making the choice your parents didn't even make the choice amen but there is an intelligence behind that amen and so i believe that as the prophet would call it a master intelligence and i i believe it's a divine intelligence amen and so with that in mind i i thought about those four living creatures they're in revelations 4 and you see them in revelations 5 and the bible speaks of how that they had eyes before and behind and within amen and so the the bible says they were full of eyes amen and brother branham said it spoke of their intelligence he said the eyes spoke of their intelligence he said because you notice he said they they had eyes behind so that they could see what was in the past they had eyes within so they knew what was right now in the present and they had eyes before that they could see into the future he said showing that they can see what was what is and what is to come he said it was a reflection of him who was and is to come amen he said through the ages showing jesus christ again being the same yesterday today and forever amen because we know that those four living creatures were a representation amen of an anointing that would be upon the church through the church ages amen but i thought it was amazing that the prophet would say that those eyes amen would represent the intelligence and and how that that intelligence amen could see not only what was in the past and not only what was in the present but actually could see what was in the future amen and we know that there's only one intelligence or amen i believe that there's only one intelligence amen that knows the end from the beginning even there is only one isaiah 42 and verse 8 amen the bible says i am the lord that is my name and my glory will i not give to another neither my praise to graven images behold the former things are come to pass and new things do i declare before they spring forth i tell you of them amen so god don't have to wait for an event to happen to tell you about it amen you see friends that's why amen god amen don't have to wait for something happening amen to tell you about like the media or or if you read about something in the newspaper it's already happened amen if you hear about it on cnn it's already happening amen you see they may try to predict things in the future amen but they cannot foretell the future amen because they are limited in knowledge even but god don't have to wait until it happens to tell you about it because he's omniscient and he knows all things amen isaiah 46 and 9 he said remember the former things of old for i am god and there is none else i'm god and there is none like me how make us say amen to that aren't you glad you're serving that god [Applause] amen i want to tell you i'm glad to have that hope in my heart tonight to know him in the power of his resurrection because i want you to know i don't know one other place to point you to tonight amen where there's any hope or any safety or any resting place there ain't a church we can point you to there ain't a government we can point you to there is only one place that we can point you tonight and that's jesus christ hallelujah it's the only place i know of amen where sick men get healed it's the only place i know of amen where poor people amen find wealth amen i'll come on church it's the only place i know amen where the weary find rest able one place i know of amen where dead men live and thy sin jesus christ and him alone hallelujah he said i am god and there is none other amen notice in verse 10 they are declaring the end from the beginning amen from the ancient times even the things that are not yet done saying my counsel shall stand and i will do all of my pleasure amen that's god amen that's the mind of god even god is infinite amen he is he is not god is not a man that he should lie amen and the mind of god goes so far beyond even the the the mind of a man the thoughts of god amen is not that the scripture that his ways are higher than eyes amen amen his thoughts are so much higher than ours amen and and the prophet said amen he said you remember this is an easter seal 1965 he said you remember even the stature that you are in this morning amen if you wasn't in his thinking then then you're not now for you are there there's some part that's in you that's eternal amen and eternal only belongs to god and in god was his thinking of you sitting right where you are now amen in his thinking he said i stood at the pulpit because he's infinite and he knows all things and therefore he could tell the end from the beginning because he is eternal and you being a son of god or a daughter of god then you were in his thinking in the beginning super sign he said god knowed the end from the beginning and therefore he could plan everything god know the end from the beginning so therefore he could plan everything i want you to understand something tonight god has not been caught by surprise there ain't one circumstance in your life that took him by surprise there ain't nothing happening on the earth today that he didn't know about why i've said it many times in my church i said listen to me god is not up in heaven tonight chewing on his fingernails having a nervous breakdown because of the condition of this world amen he knew it would be this way and he's already made plans for it hallelujah even god knew that the world would be in this condition amen in the end time amen and he's already made a way of escape for them that will believe now watch as the prophet says see he said he knew the beginning from the end so therefore he could plan everything and that it would work out just to his glory that just gives us courage to know that no matter what comes or what goes god is working everything see the clock is ticking just exactly on time amen the world has fallen apart brother brown said god has an expectation i i thought about that and i thought man you know a lot of times we preach a lot about our expectation amen brother brown said god has an expectation and he said amen the reason why is because he knows what's going to happen amen now you might have come to church tonight hoping amen that you was gonna get a touch or you know hope and just pray and say oh god amen you know but god's expectation of this service will not amen amen he's not hoping it's gonna turn out that way he already knows how it's going to turn out and he knew every person that would be here and he knew all the people that wouldn't be here amen and yet he ain't worried about it amen you know i had to remind myself a lot about that a lot as a pastor because amen i get so worried about the people that ain't at church sometimes i forget about the ones that come amen and and you got to realize god already knew they wasn't going to be there even but he knew you were going to be here [Applause] and he knew what was on your heart and he knew all the needs that you had so the prophet said he had an expectation he knows what's going to happen see because he's infinite so there's nothing going wrong man that's a that is a statement ain't it the problem there ain't nothing going wrong you say man i wonder if he could say that in 2021. amen well listen there was a lot of trouble when he said that there was things going up amen amen you understand i believe the problem is standing here tonight amen and say the same thing because i happen to believe that god is still in control in the in the in the circumstances of this world amen has not taken god off of his throne but can i just quote a prophet he is right now governing in the affairs of men god is on the throne even tonight right in the midst of all of our trouble right in the midst of the darkest hour of this world amen god is still in control man in the prophecy nothing is going wrong it's all going exactly right because he's infinite amen he can foretell the end from the beginning he's god don't you think satan's putting anything over on him oh no it's just all working out to display his attributes see how could god even a great infinite god who knowed everything and then let everything let these things happen the prophet said he's only doing that amen so that his attributes can be let expressed challenge you in this tonight every place in this bible where one of the redemptive names of jehovah was revealed it was in a time of distress it was in a time amen when people didn't know which way to turn and they didn't know what to do amen when he revealed himself amen as jehovah jireh even abraham was taking his son and laying him on an altar getting ready to take his life even but god comes down in that extreme circumstances amen and shows himself amen as a provider [Applause] trace it all through the scripture amen it was in the great hours of distress and times when amen when they had no other place to turn and there was no other hope that they had amen let me tell you some church i believe we're getting in the place right now amen we're going to have to trust god with everything within us amen because there ain't no other answer no other place and we can't trust the government i know i'm preaching the people that know this amen you can't put your trust in nothing amen but we have something to anchor our souls in and we have a place amen that we can turn in this hour amen and if there was ever a time for us to look away to jesus it's right here tonight because it's the only hope that we have hallelujah so god will allow certain circumstances and things that take place so that he can display amen how could god ever be known as a deliverer nobody was ever in bondage how could he ever be known as a as a savior if what nothing never lost how could he ever be a redeemer amen as brother uh david was preaching last night somebody amen had to fall amen for him to do that how could it be known as a healer unless somebody got sick so god allows these things amen and to bring out an attribute he meant to manifest his power even to show a man that no i don't care what how impossible it seems amen god is a god of impossibilities [Applause] he specializes in them kind of circumstances hallelujah amen you start looking at things the right way it make you get excited when everything's turned upside down oh church i'll tell you something tonight amen if we really start coming through this bible and reading about what god did yesterday and we're getting to realize that whatever he did then as brother david said last night was a prophecy of something he will do again and we see when they got their back up against the wall amen and when the children of israel come out of egypt and they were led to the red sea and the red sea was in front of them pharaoh's army behind them cliffs on both sides and there was nowhere to go that's when god stepped down and made a way where there was no way hallelujah can i say this tonight i believe we're getting in a place for a perfect opportunity for a god of miracles to step down out of heaven hallelujah and show his power and prove amen who he is you believe that tonight let me remind you brother brown when he took a text from the rapture he took it out of psalms 27 amen which was a time of trouble and he said here's a background for the rapture a time of trouble oh brother if there was ever a time of trouble we're living in it now and i want to encourage you church is only setting the scene for a change of act body we're getting ready to go home amen we're getting ready to leave here in victory god knew it and he planned it amen amen he knew it was going to happen and he made plans for it he knew the world was going to get in this condition so he met he he had a a prophet called malachi to speak some words hallelujah behold i send you elijah before the great and dreadful day of the lord and he shall turn the hearts of the children back to the faith of the fathers he knew that this world was going to get in religious chaos he knew a man that every denomination was going to twist the scripture amen and take creed over the word amen he knew it and he planned for it so he sent us a profit turn our hearts back to faith [Applause] your birth was pre-planned your parents might not have planned for it but god did every one of you your birth was pre-planned brother ben said did you know that you your beginning never originated just as a myth or a thought come on church they trying to teach our kids in schools they come from monkeys and stuff but even the prophet said amen listen you didn't come out of some myth not some theory amen it was by the by the pre-planned amen of almighty god he says he said god before the foundation of the world he knew you would be here therefore there is nothing out of catering now man is it's fine we we don't know all things see we're limited in our knowledge and so brother brown says in god's chosen place of worship he said see a great unchanging god cannot change man changes but see you can put your life upon anything that god ever said at any time because it's the truth amen is the truth because there's only one thing i have confidence in that's the bible because man's word will fail but god is supreme he said see this year i'll know more than i did last year and you should too each day see we're finite so we we gain knowledge but god is infinite he's evident and and being infinite he cannot gain knowledge he's perfect he's perfect to begin with his first thought was a perfect thought so he says therefore every decision is exactly right now see we we learn from our mistakes or sometimes you know most of the time some better than others i mean but we we we should you know learn from our mistakes you know god ain't never learned from a mistake because he never made a mistake so god didn't have to try something amen to figure out what didn't work before he found out what would work because he's infant he knows all things and so because you know we're we're finite we're limited in our knowledge i mean you know most most men look to the past to to try to gain uh an understanding of the present or to to actually because you know it's not a bad thing even you know patrick henry i believe made a statement he said the only way to judge the future is by the past and and and i believe it was wisdom because when when men begin to realize that you know history repeats itself and they can look back at the success or the failures of other men and they could see if this you know if this army that's just taking the military realms if this army did these certain things you know they they either won a battle or they lost about or they and they've studied even all through uh time you know they've studied history amen not just because they were interested in something that happened a hundred years ago but they were trying to even gain an understanding of how to prepare for the future by studying history you understand and i believe it's actually a good thing amen and that's why amen it's good for us to even look back at times to what god has done yesterday amen because we can see brother brown taught us that if we meet god on the same basis if we approach him the same way and god cannot change in his nature and his in his essence what he did for them he will have to do for you hallelujah let me just stop and preach right here for a minute amen because if you read over in acts 2 amen and you see there where somebody repented and was baptized in the name of lord jesus christ and they were filled with the holy ghost if god did that then hallelujah amen and if you do the same thing they did you have to get the same result that they got if somebody rose up in faith and so i'm gonna take god at his word and i'm gonna profess and claim that he is my healer in spite of how i feel in spite of what the circumstances are it's about what the doctor says and if somebody did that and god come down and heal their body amen he is no respecter of persons [Applause] i just want to say this me and look back to history to try to to predict the future to try to get an understanding of the present but god has no need of looking back god don't have to look back amen amen to what happened a thousand years ago to tell you what's going to happen tomorrow he already knows that's why this bible ain't just a history book there's a lot of history in the bible but it ain't a history book come on church this bible amen is a book of prophecy you believe that amen the prophet said amen 40 men wrote the bible over the space of 1600 years apart amen at different times predicting the most important events that ever happened in the world's history and many of them hundreds of years before they happen and there's not one era in the entire 66 books of the bible amen no author but god could write such a book let me tell you but one intelligence can write a book like this over the span of sixteen hundred years amen by forty different men which were scribes amen because there ain't 40 authors of the bible there's only one but there was different scribes that wrote it amen but there's only one intelligence amen that could start a story amen 1600 years before and finishes 1600 years later and used 40 different men to do it and many of them never met and they never consulted with one another and when it got finished it was one contradiction hallelujah and and people want to criticize it amen listen foreign amen this book has been criticized made fun of amen through to the side disregarded but i want to tell you what i believe i believe it's the infallible word of almighty god hallelujah it's not the book even uh of a better idea it's not crazy and ethics amen it's jesus christ in written form it's a book of prophecy amen god spoke wrote things in this bible that's happening right now over a thousand years ago amen think about that for a minute and i want to ask you a question how did moses write the old testament where did he get that information how do you know what happened in garden eden was he there come on i'm asking the question tonight how did he know amen what what adam said what eve said how do you know about all these how do you know about abraham how did he know he'd say well it was just passed down from generation to generation amen i don't believe that i believe what happened was amen as he met a pillar of fire [Music] brother brown said he got his information out that pillar of fire amen in other words what he wrote was coming from another intelligence [Applause] i might not have time but i'm going to stay here for a minute long enough to say this amen listen even a prophet amen it's not amen that god just comes down and inspires their thinking ain't like a preacher standing i pulled again under a little inspiration say a few things amen when a prophet speaks it didn't come out of his mind and god didn't inspire his thoughts he bypasses his thoughts and spoke his own words through their lips they didn't even know what they were saying brother brown said many of them if they would have knew what they were saying they would have never said it but it wasn't them that was saying it to start with there was another intelligence that was speaking through their lips hallelujah i'm just gonna go ahead and say it tonight and give the devil a good black eye this message we believe did not come out of the mind of a sixth grade kentucky boy amen no sir this was not the foster william brown this is not a man's message this is the mind of god spoke through the mouth of a prophet to give you rapturing faith [Applause] hallelujah oh you say you're too bold with that amen let me tell you something i'll scream it from the high smell i preach it till the day i die even dang i ain't gonna let no spirit out of hell come in and diminish and be little and take away and discredit what god has done in our day this ain't just another movement come on church this ain't just another healing revival this ain't another smith wigglesworth this is not just another man coming out amen with a gift in his life this is the word of almighty god to take us back to the original word [Music] [Applause] that's how moses knew what happened in the garden of eden it's what he was writing was coming right out of the mind of god and think about this moses wrote about things that had already happened he wrote about things that were happening then and he wrote about things that are to be amen and i say the same intelligence that told him about what had been shown him what was getting ready to come and amen the same intelligence that told him even and showed him what happened to the garden of eden even showed him prophecies that would come to pass thousands of years later this is dangerous because i ain't looking at no clocks or nothing and [Applause] i just want to ask you a question if if looking to the past can give you a great advantage in preparing for the future how much more of an advantage would you have if you could actually see the future come on church don't you realize that nations and armies and men have have spent billions of dollars and they have they have spent hours and uh uh you know given their lives to study and amen uh history amen so that they might be able to some way prepare and predict for the future amen and and in some cases it gives them a heavy advantage whether they're trying to have a business or they're trying to rule a nation or whatever they're doing it could give them a great advantage by knowing even what has been but if that could give you an advantage what if you could see what would [Applause] can i be you an example of that in the scripture amen there's a king down there in syria one day warren with israel amen and everywhere he would go amen the armies of israel was waiting on him and he got to thinking you know what hey somebody in our camp amen we got a mole in the camp we got somebody there's a spy in the camp amen there ain't no way that they know where we're going unless somebody's telling them they just that we're losing too many battles every time even they always got the up they're three steps in front of us all the time amen he got all this close uh men gathered them together and he said listen there's something wrong here somebody hey man say we gotta we gotta spy among us remember the days a man rose up and said no king he said oh but there's a prophet down there in israel [Applause] he tells the king of israel the things you speak in your bed chamber hallelujah amen and and the king didn't understand how in the world do they know where i'm going before i get there and he was so frustrated even but the man rose up and said the problem is is they got a connection with the almighty [Applause] they got a man in their camp that by the vision can see amen into the future and he knows where you're going before you get there oh church i want to tell you tonight you're frustrating to the devil and i believe the devil is wondering tonight why are you still here and why didn't all them tactics that worked with everybody else worked for you and it seemed like you knew what he was going to do before he ever done it amen let's let the devil in a little secret tonight amen we got a prophet in the land and our enemy has been exposed we know the tactics of the devil hallelujah brother brown said looking to the unseen he said somebody asked me not long ago said brother brown what do you think about the future i said i don't know i don't know what the future holds but i know who holds the future so that's the thing if i can just keep acquainted with him i don't have to know everything god knows what i got to do is stay acquainted with him come on church amen brother brown said god didn't even tell his prophets everything amen but they didn't need to know everything but we know enough that the one we're following has never failed us [Applause] and he has led us this far and he's kept us this far hallelujah and because of this i've got a great confidence to know that the god that i've followed this far has kept me all my life is going to lead me all the way hallelujah [Applause] let me just say this tonight because you know sometimes sometimes and this is a very true thing there ain't nothing you know about the past and we we get and this is the thought that we have and it's so true the only way to change the future is in the prison you understand but i want to just kind of give you this kind this idea that the future could actually change the prison see because i'm not here tonight trying to in the present change my future because i believe in predestination and i believe my future is clear but i believe many times if i could see the future it might change my presence you understand what i'm saying let me just give you an example of that but brother branham says amen and he's in discernment here i think this is so powerful y'all just bear with me a few minutes amen but i think this is so powerful because brother brown says he's talking to a lady and deserving he says do you believe he says do you believe that these things are taking place is from god the spirit of god do you lady he said then us being strangers to each other he said then if something would happen that i would would let me know something about you see if god could tell me what you have been surely he can tell me what you will be and if he knows the past then he knows the future and that makes it it proves that it is god another place he's in discernment again he says isn't he lovely sister he's the fairest of ten thousand he's a lily of the valleys he's a brat and morning star and i perceive it right now that you are a christian because your spirit begins to feel welcome see i know that somewhere standing near he's standing because your spirit and the holy spirit which is now on me is becoming in contact with each other see and now he can he can reveal to me and if he knows what your past has been amen and now you'll you're the judge of that now if he'll tell you what your future will be surely if he knows the past then he knows the future now if he would tell you the future before he told you the past see then you would wonder whether it was going to happen or not see but he if he tells you what you already know has happened then you know whether the future's going to be right see you see how he does it he makes it so real that there's no way out of it listen the next words out of his mouth amen now this audience can still hear my voice the woman seems to be moving away from me she's going back i see her she's standing in a building she's before a doctor and the doctor says she has a tumor the tumor is a thyroid tumor he says you must have an operation immediately frankly i see a shadow come over that that has been in the middle of last week you were uh to be operated on but the reason you didn't was you heard i was coming here amen and you wanted to come and wanted me to pray for you before that could take place that's this saith the lord and he told the woman something that she alone knew and she's standing there and she knows there's no way this man knew that i went to a doctor and them doctor said them words but a god that could tell me what a doctor told me two weeks ago if he tells me i'll be walking in the morning why would i ever doubt what that god said hallelujah can i pick up from there brother david from last night i mean a god that could tell me what happened in the garden of eden listen this message didn't come just to tell us we as a bunch of sinners it come to tell us why and what happened and the reason we were in that condition not to leave us there he told us where we were hallelujah but i'm glad that this intelligence didn't start in genesis 1. but way back in the back part of god's mind before the foundation of the world before there was a fall there were some sons of god that was shouting for joy hallelujah and i was there hallelujah you want to know why you're here amen in the word tonight this ain't the first time you amen this word this ain't the first time you shouted for joy this is the first time that you sung the praises of god before the foundational world in the mind of god the sons of god were shouted for joy and i was there that's my past but let me tell you about my future hallelujah because i was shouting then i'm shouting out but one of these days i'm going to a meeting in the air and if you think i act crazy now just wait till my change comes if you think this is noisy just wait till we get to the other side i love what the prophecy this ain't no new religion it's the oldest one there is hallelujah amen this ain't no new thing even somebody say well looks like there's a new movement coming around the message a bunch of excitement people are praising god and shouting no it ain't new amen we're just getting back to our roots we're getting back amen to what we were born to be hallelujah did not jesus do the same thing the woman at the whale what are you doing he told her about her past showed her future see and brother brown said it was the wisdom of god amen because god knows if he just made some statements about your future amen you'd be questioning so you really know what he's talking about but because he was so detailed and so accurate and telling you about things even that only you and him know and he told you all about come on for not to embarrass you come on jesus didn't come to that woman to embarrass her about the situation she was in he was igniting a seed of faith that was laying in her heart light was flashing across a predestinated seed what kind of intelligence knows these things listen brother brown says he's down there talking about infidel that time you know what you remember he got the man looked over it man it was weird brother i can't remember right now but he said you you're so sorry you got to hang out with the preacher and all that kind of stuff and the man didn't like preachers he was he's an infidel brother brown just started talking to him he didn't get his bible out and you know all that kind of so he just started talking to him and after a while you know that man himself says i like there is one preacher i'd like to meet one day i started talking about a neighbor that was dying cancer and you all know the story so i ain't going to try to tell it tonight but amen but what brother brown do he pointed that tree he says now he says what kind of intelligence tells that life in that tree to go down in the roots in the wintertime and hide there until the winter's past come back in the spring of the year what kind tells us he said now you think about that while i go squirrel hunt said when i get back if you tell me what intelligence tells that tree to do that he said i'll tell you what intelligence told me what was wrong with that woman up there he said you mean to tell me that you're that preacher amen you can tell me let me ask you the question amen what what intelligence tells them ducks even how to fly south in the winter amen with no gps no compasses come on church what intelligence tells them salmon amen at the time of year and then they start gathering together out there in the ocean amen and they and listen to me even they're they're a freshwater fish that are in a saltwater atmosphere but they were never born to be there and at a certain season they begin to gather together and brother brown said in united time inside he said they unite together you know why they're coming together amen they ain't coming together amen to see who the most spiritual among them or who's got the best colors what's the biggest fish come on church they're gathering together to go back amen from where they come from and people don't understand what these meetings are all about and why people drive across the country amen and come from near and far amen and we're not here to see who's the best preacher and we're not here to see who's the best dressed we are gathering to leave we are gathering together for our action hallelujah let me tell you something about them fish amen them fish have something built in them they ain't got no gps signs of stuff they don't understand how they do it and they'll go right back to the very stream that they come out of and they'll swim right back to the very place they were hatched [Applause] and they'll leap over dams they'll do impossible feats they go through every kind of obstacle and circumstance and there's all kind of bears and and predators gathered around them rivers aiming to take advantage of the situation but that don't stop them brother said nothing can stop them and if you can tell me what intelligence leads them and what gives them that drive i'll tell you why you've been through every church split you got everything happen in your family come on church you've got every problem that everybody else has ever had but you kept pressing and you kept coming and you're still here and you're still going and nothing is going to stop you we'll do impossible feats we'll leap over the waterfalls appreciate man until we get back came back to the place of our birth it's incredible it's a paradox brother that says credible but true i read a story one time as one of them fish was born in a hat tree they released that fish out of the hatchery went out into the ocean they tagged it that fish swam back up that river and it went back and then it come to them pipes that let out that hatchery and that pipe was shut off because it was made to keep fish from swimming in only to release fish and they said this salmon amen went and it started bumping into that that that that thing that was over that pipe with his nose and just kept bumping it and backing up and bumping it and backing up and bumping it and back it up until it broke through swam up that pipe and went right back into the very hatchery it was released out of and they found that catfish right back and impossible for it to get their nose all bloodied and bruised amen broke through everybody let me tell the devil's telling you can't [Applause] listen to every church i know the devil's telling you it changed but god is saying you can't the devil's saying hey it's impossible but not gosh if all things are possible to give that believer glory to god let me tell you some young people amen amen this world amen every voice you hear is saying it can't be done you'll never make it you can't live that kind of life in this modern age but there is a power on the inside of you that cannot be explained there's an intelligence beyond man's intelligence that's leading you i figured my time's going but i ain't done it amen i'll tell you this they may sell them monarch butterflies and hey man they make their way back brother they don't even know their neighbor they never make a full cycle they don't live long enough never make a full cycle even they've never been that way before they have never flown that path but when they are making their their their uh what do you call that somebody help me migration yeah when they're doing that amen they will actually land in the exact same trees that their parents landed in same kind of tree might be in a row there's ten of them but they only land in one and they do it in the same one every year and they've never been there how they know to do that is their divine intelligence in them i think about the children of israel where the bible says they have not passed that way before but they were following somebody church there ain't never been a rapture like this there's never been a group of people all at one time get a body change we ain't never walked this way before but we're following one hallelujah he knows the way let me try to begin to bring this to close but i want you to understand something i want to show you how seeing your future can actually change you in the present he's a man by the name of congressman upshaw brother brown said he said i've never seen a man before didn't know him he said but i had a vision and i saw a man i saw a young man a boy he'd fall off some kind of wagon he was injured and he said in that and he said and then i seen a man he said some kind of you know collar on or something like i don't remember zach where's brother brown used to describe himself but he's speaking to a large audience of people this man was crippled and he said i've seen the people appalling this man brother brown says as he's telling the vision there's a brother standing there brother baxter i believe it was he said brother brown that's congressman upshaw he's in the meeting he said he's right in front of you now he said i looked at the man and he said i said that is that is the man that is the man he said a vision breaks brother brown sees a doctor with big thick glasses on and he sees that doctor and he's he's he's looking at a a little black girl and he's shaking his head and he says the doc he said he realized the doctor had just taken her tonsils out and he'd paralyzed the girl from her neck down and he says he says that now brother brown starts telling this vision he starts telling this vision he said there's a woman an older black lady sitting on the or sitting in the audience he says she says that's my baby that's my baby he said then i see that little girl even walking down the street carrying a baby doll he said then i knew it was all over he said she's healed that's thus saith the lord the child was immediately healed amen even he told her about the past he told her about the future it changed her in the present he said all of a sudden standing there a vision breaks he sees a man walking down the street amen with a brown suit or something like that hat on his head he begins to say he said i seen that i knew it was over then amen he spoke and he says amen he speaks in the name of the lord even that the congressman upshaw will be healed he said and for the first time in 66 years a man that had been crippled that had served in the halls of our congress amen stood to his feet for the first time in 66 years how did he do that he told him what happened 66 years ago when he was a little boy and he said but wait a minute i see you walking down the street with a brown suit on amen and when he saw a glimpse of his future brother brown said he'd been in meeting after meeting he had been to old robbers he'd been to other men he said many had prayed for him but brother when a vision was spoke over his life and he saw the future he stood to his feet for the first time well i want to say it right now but i got to give you another one before i get there amen brother graham tells a testimony about a boy in africa they led that boy onto that platform with a chain he made he'd come up there with walking like an animal he wasn't even in his right mind he couldn't even speak nothing he really let him up there like a dog amen when they led that boy on that platform amen brother benham said he looked at that boy and he says now he he discerned what was in that boy's heart is he was he was thinking about his brother who was a church could you imagine this boy could not speak he could not stand he could not form a sentence he could not even uh uh make sense out of what he was hearing but what was on his heart church i want you to understand something all you young people listen to me real close right here the devil can do a lot of things in your mind but your heart don't belong to him if you allow him every time a passing thought comes through there he'll condemn you by and beat you down with it amen but i want you to know leave here tonight and the next time the devil puts something in your mind you say devil you might can put something in my mind but my heart has been reserved for almighty god hallelujah amen and i might have thought about that i'm going to repent about it right now my heart belongs to jesus christ brother brown said that boy was singing about his brother who was a and he saw a vision he said he saw that boy riding a yellow goaters you want to find it in the message all you gotta do is put in y'all to go because you ain't gonna find many times brother brown said that but anyway he's riding some y'all go to her dog i believe he says he says he says now he says he begins to see that vision and that boy fell and was injured and he's walking on uh clubs or or crutches or whatever it was he said as he's saying that he said there's so many people there like nearly a city block but as he's saying that that boy somewhere in that in that audience amen all of a sudden here comes a man running leaping and jumping and praising god amen and as he gets down there close he said i'm that boy i'm that's me amen he was not walking on crutches and as all this is going on brother brown one place he said took him there in 30 minutes just to calm that boy down he said but then a vision broke he said and i saw the boy on the platform standing in front of me in his right mind he said then i knew it was over he looked into his past but then he looked into his future he said i began to speak to that boy he said but he could not understand what i was saying go back and listen to what brother brown said he said as i spoke to him through the interpreter he could not understand what i was saying amen it shows listen church amen god the power of god goes beyond your understanding the power of god goes beyond your ability brother man said there he was a chain around his neck and brother brown said i love this he says i reached down and i picked up that chain oh god i reached down and i picked up that chain and i lifted him up and for the first time in that boy's life because he was born in that condition he stood to his feet brother bill said in his right mind tears running down his face reminds me of what happened in acts 3 in this bible when peter and john went caught by the gate called beautiful and there's a man begging ours been lame from his birth amen but the bible says they said silver and gold have enough but such as i have give out thee in the name of jesus christ rise up and walk and my bible says peter stretched forth his right hand amen and he lifted him to his feet until his ankle bones receive strength and that man went leaping and running and praising god in the temple amen let me tell you some church whether you can see it or not amen let me tell you i just told you of a couple testimonies but let me tell you about mine amen because there was a time amen when i was just as lost as that african boil now i was just just chained up amen i didn't have my right mind come on church i had no ability to lift myself up i couldn't even understand what i was hearing but a hand reached down y'all don't call me crazy but i'll just tell you what i believe this message reached down and found me when i couldn't help myself and when i was found in every chain of scene the grace of god reached that invaded me and lifted me up and for the first time in my life i stood on my feet and clothing my right mind have the ability oh hallelujah thank you jesus amen and i say that same god is in this building tonight you might be here crippled beat down chained up but let me tell you hear the voice of the lord tonight my god is able amen he can tell you about your past but he can tell you about your future [Music] let me tell you there's some places you can't go by yourself there's some things you'll never do on your own when our ability ends his is just getting started [Applause] seven steps leading up to the king's chamber you get up to the top listen you can't make that last step on you on you've got to get some help if you're going to go into the presence of the king but he's still jehovah jair and god knows where my ability ends i'm glad to know tonight i ain't standing here on my own power the grace of god that we heard preached about last night is so amazing reach down he found this picked us up and then set our feet on a solid rock you believe that tonight let me tell you something church i believe even what intelligence has opened these words this word what it tells brother ben said was the intelligence man that told us what these seals are he said no he said it was it was the dynamics of the holy spirit amen broke these things told us amen amen about the past amen he told us amen what happened in the garden told us where we come from told us why we're here told us where we're going preach to us great things amen things that are to be told us about our future now i want to encourage you with this as i'm closing night musicians come amen i want to encourage you with this because there's a time in brother brown's life brother brown actually it was in that same trip to africa he failed god remember he disobeyed and he went and done something brother adam come back home a sick man the doctors didn't give him no hope i'm not gonna try to go through the whole story but i'm just telling you this everybody remembers this brother brown got so discouraged and such in a place because he said god seemed like the god wouldn't hear his prayer he said it was just silent no god you know just god wouldn't hear him and he says you know he says i was thinking he was thinking he even told his wife he said he said i guess this is the end you know what brother brown even in one place i i i i'm just going off memory here but one place i believe brother brown talked about he said he said well you know he's thinking about the great meeting that he had in effort he said well he said you know on the essence of what he was thinking was i guess that'd be a good one a good meeting to end a ministry you know just such a god just overlooked all that and moved in such a miraculous way but he said he was he was pacing the floor one night middle of the night and he was thinking about his future and he was saying i guess i've come to the end [Music] it's no you know my ministry's over he said all of a sudden that presence come in the room he said for a first time in a long time i knew he was there and he saw if i'm not mistaken a hand or something didn't come there was some papers brother brown described like typewriter papers he said that hand took and just threw him up he said it just began to stack up leading our way up into heaven and the voice spoken says and as you were thinking on your future brother brown says that's exactly right what that voice tone says your future is clear [Music] this is not your end let me tell you tonight you might be pacing the floor you might say well i failed god and maybe you did listen to me maybe you did maybe you did fail god maybe it's all true and god's been silent brother brown said when god's silent devil does a lot of talking [Music] maybe you're in that condition tonight and you're pacing that floor back and forth hey man you think it's surely my hand i

dimension he saw a bunch of people millions of them as in fact amen and and when he when the voice spoke and he said well paul had to stand with his people he said yes he said praise god because i preached what paul preached [Music] and this might be crazy to you but i believe i screamed out said brother branham i'm resting on that church i might not feel like it tonight and you not might feel
