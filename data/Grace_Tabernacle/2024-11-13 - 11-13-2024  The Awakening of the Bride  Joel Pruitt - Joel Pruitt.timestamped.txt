[40:47] debin with the back problems that she'd
[40:50] had they uh they took her in uh they put
[40:54] it off a couple of times but they
[40:55] operated on her yesterday and
[40:57] it was about a 12-hour surgery it was
[40:59] rough and they U said that there was
[41:02] four she had four broken vertebraes
[41:04] instead of two took about like I said 12
[41:07] hours so she was out a long time and had
[41:10] some side effects from the anesthesia
[41:12] but she's doing better and I'm thankful
[41:14] that we serve a god brother
[41:16] Joe when I was praying for I was kind of
[41:19] worried
[41:20] for but I thought you know what the
[41:23] Bible says the angel of the Lord en
[41:25] camps around about them that fear Him
[41:27] and if you could have seen it in that
[41:29] operating room that day I believe that
[41:31] there was angels and if you could look
[41:33] be on this Veil right now there's angels
[41:35] in here I believe they're concerned
[41:38] tonight and they're giving charge over
[41:40] you cuz we have a father that brother
[41:42] saids concerned so we're going to take
[41:44] these needs before the

[42:41] much Lord I just pray tonight to each
[42:44] one of these Lord that I know you're

[45:31] glory and you believe he's worthy of it
[45:33] all tonight amen if you have a need on
[45:35] your heart I wonder if we could just bow
[45:37] our heads one more
[45:39] time just before the word Goes Forth I
[45:41] wonder if we could just say Lord open my
[45:43] heart
[45:44] tonight not to what a man could bring
[45:47] but I believe God has something special
[45:49] every time we come to the house of
[45:51] God if we could just lay aside all the
[45:54] tiredness and all the work that we've
[45:56] done today today everything that would
[45:59] try to so easily beset us and maybe keep
[46:01] us from a blessing here tonight let's
[46:03] just bow our heads for a moment if you
[46:05] have a need just put your hand up to him
[46:07] tonight Heavenly Father Lord I pray Lord
[46:10] for each and every person that's sitting
[46:11] in the sound of my voice tonight Lord if
[46:14] there's sickness here I pray Lord they
[46:16] wouldn't leave feeble or sick tonight
[46:19] and Lord I pray that if there's one here
[46:21] tonight that's a backslider or needs
[46:22] salvation or maybe just a refilling of
[46:24] the Holy Ghost Lord there's nothing too
[46:26] hard for God and we believe that this
[46:28] could be their night here tonight Lord
[46:32] we believe that this was an appointment
[46:33] that was made in before the foundation
[46:35] of the world where we would be standing
[46:37] here and the people would be sitting or
[46:39] standing there and Lord you had a
[46:42] thought in mind and you thought that you
[46:43] would want to feed your people here
[46:45] tonight and maybe there would be
[46:47] something Lord that would just try to
[46:49] come in this service to hinder the move
[46:51] of God but Lord we say we want to break
[46:53] every wall down and every chain here
[46:55] tonight and just worship freely in the
[46:57] house of God I pray Lord you would move
[46:59] everything out of the way that would be
[47:00] unlike you everything that would not be
[47:02] pleasing to you we pray you would remove
[47:04] it tonight bind my lips that I wouldn't
[47:06] say anything that would be contrary to
[47:08] your word and I pray you would move
[47:09] Among Us now in Jesus name we pray and
[47:12] the church said amen if you have your
[47:15] Bibles I'm not going to sing tonight
[47:17] we're going to just you guys have done a
[47:19] wonderful job the child your cries of
[47:21] awoken the master I love that one of my
[47:24] favorite songs and I I I appreciate yall
[47:26] singing that one that's it's good and if
[47:28] I had a thought tonight if you have your
[47:29] Bibles go ahead turn to Psalms 85 and
[47:31] we'll start with verse 6 actually 85 and
[47:34] verse 6 if I had a thought tonight I
[47:36] would like to title it the Awakening of
[47:38] the
[47:39] bride and just a just a simple thought
[47:42] if we can make it that way tonight if
[47:44] the Lord will help us Psalms 85 and
[47:46] verse
[47:47] 6 wilt thou not revive us again that thy
[47:51] people may rejoice in thee show us thy
[47:55] mercy oh Lord and grant us thy
[47:58] salvation I will hear what God the Lord
[48:01] will speak for he will speak peace unto
[48:03] his people and to his Saints but let
[48:06] them not turn again to Folly and if we
[48:09] could also turn over in our Bibles there
[48:12] just if we could go to Genesis chapter 2
[48:16] Genesis chapter 2 and verse
[48:18] 21 Genesis 2 and
[48:21] 21 and the Lord God caused a deep sleep
[48:24] to fall upon Adam and he slept and he
[48:27] took one of his ribs and closed up the
[48:29] flesh instead thereof and the rib which
[48:31] the Lord God had taken from man made he
[48:34] a woman and brought her unto the man and
[48:36] Adam said this is now bone of my bones
[48:39] and Flesh of My Flesh and she shall be
[48:42] called woman because she was taken out
[48:44] of man so we want to just stop there and
[48:47] may the Lord add His blessings to the
[48:48] word you may be
[48:51] seated take
[49:00] amen how many's happy happy to be in the
[49:02] house of the Lord tonight I know it's
[49:04] Wednesday night so we're just going I'm
[49:05] just going to take all the restrictions
[49:06] off and maybe we'll just preach here for
[49:07] a little biten if that' be okay with you
[49:10] it's always good to come back here and I
[49:12] appreciate brother Matt and and the
[49:14] opportunity I I count this an honor to
[49:17] come here and speak to what we'd
[49:18] consider a sister Church of ours and and
[49:20] uh I I I really enjoyed the tent
[49:22] Meetings online they're really good I'm
[49:25] sorry I couldn't make all the services
[49:26] but uh we didn't know what you know the
[49:29] dates until kind of last minute so
[49:30] brother Matt already told me the dates
[49:32] for next year so we're good and uh I
[49:35] don't have any I'm without excuse and so
[49:38] and so so we just we just but we love
[49:40] you all and we appreciate your heart to
[49:42] serve people thank you all so much when
[49:44] you come and support our meetings and we
[49:45] pray that we can continue to do the same
[49:47] we do love every one of you I want to
[49:49] send greetings from my pastor brother
[49:50] Ben puit and uh he he loves you all as
[49:54] well and right here tonight when I was
[49:57] studying this thought it kind of come to
[50:00] me just my mind works different brother
[50:03] Matt I may not be a normal preacher
[50:05] everything's a little odd everything's a
[50:06] little bit uh all over the place I'm a
[50:08] little scattered when I even when I
[50:10] preach but I'm definitely that way when
[50:11] I'm studying because I may have four or
[50:13] five different thoughts going at the
[50:14] same time now where do where does the
[50:15] Lord want me to go well this one uh was
[50:17] the only one that survived without
[50:19] getting deleted so so that's the only
[50:21] one I got and so uh but you know I want
[50:24] you also tonight just to just to think
[50:26] back
[50:27] we read there in Genesis 2 how God would
[50:30] actually cause Adam to sleep and I want
[50:32] us just to think about that for a minute
[50:34] when he actually took Eve from the side
[50:37] of Adam you notice the animals he would
[50:39] take he would he would create a male
[50:41] animal he could maybe a monkey and then
[50:43] uh the female monkey would actually come
[50:44] from the dirt as well you notice but in
[50:46] the female life when Adam was made there
[50:49] had to come a woman from Adam it
[50:52] couldn't be just another piece of dirt
[50:54] but it had to be from the very flesh of
[50:56] Adam and so there was something there
[50:59] that God was thinking way ahead in time
[51:01] and he thought of a bride that was going
[51:02] to come that had to be bone of his bone
[51:04] flesh of his flesh and I would like to
[51:06] just go ahead and get ahead of my Sermon
[51:07] Just a little bit tonight and say that's
[51:09] you here tonight you are bone of his
[51:11] bone you are flesh of his flesh amen I
[51:13] believe we are his bride tonight brother
[51:15] brandom said you are she and I I would
[51:18] just like to say here tonight just to
[51:19] encourage you don't get discouraged in
[51:21] the time we live in because this age may
[51:24] be going down but the bride is looking
[51:26] up because I believe we're closer than
[51:28] we've ever been can you say Amen so
[51:30] we're not looking for Destruction if
[51:31] you're in the bride we're not looking uh
[51:33] for Doom and Gloom if you're in the
[51:34] bride but what we're looking for tonight
[51:36] is a Rapture can you say amen and we
[51:38] have actually become the very body of
[51:41] Jesus Christ on the earth here tonight
[51:43] so we're not looking we're not looking
[51:44] for another bride to come we're not
[51:46] looking for another Messenger to bring
[51:47] another bride but we have heard the
[51:49] voice of God in our day and we know that
[51:51] we have been called for such a time as
[51:54] this can you say amen and so if you go
[51:56] to Malachi 4 just real quick I didn't
[51:58] put this in there but Malachi 4 youall
[52:00] know it but if you go down there in
[52:02] verse two he said unto you that fear my
[52:04] name shall the son of righteousness
[52:06] arise with healing in his wings and you
[52:08] shall go forth and grow up as calves of
[52:10] the stall so think about the calves of
[52:11] the stall they've been fed good you've
[52:13] had Mana from Heaven you've you've
[52:15] you've been feasting on spiritual food
[52:16] in due season there's a Time such as
[52:19] this that the bride had to be ready to
[52:21] go so they had to have something to feed
[52:23] on can you say amen and so we're not
[52:25] just feeding on another denominational
[52:27] idea or another opinion of a man but
[52:29] we're actually feeding on the very body
[52:31] word of the son of man can you say amen
[52:33] and so we realized that in Malachi 4 God
[52:36] would send a prophet that in an age that
[52:38] would be so dark and where the Revival
[52:40] fires had died out there would be no
[52:42] Awakening in the modern churches oh they
[52:44] might have good music they might have
[52:46] dancing they might have shouting and I
[52:47] believe in all of those things I hope
[52:49] you do too because there's nothing wrong
[52:51] with shouting over what you believe in
[52:53] there's nothing wrong with having a good
[52:55] time in the house of God but remember
[52:57] those things are not what save you those
[52:59] things are not your anchor those things
[53:01] are just uh those are good things to
[53:02] have those are things when I tell you
[53:04] what you can bask in the presence of God
[53:06] and and I believe I tell you what I I've
[53:08] told our church I wish we had more that
[53:09] run the aisles I wish we had more that
[53:11] stand up and drown you out when you was
[53:13] preaching that's okay because what it is
[53:15] that that's just people getting excited
[53:17] they've been stimulated by the
[53:18] Revelation that has come and I'm I'm
[53:20] good with that but let me tell you
[53:21] that's not the focus of the hour the
[53:23] focus is the word that has been opened
[53:26] in this day to reveal the secrets of the
[53:29] the people to reveal the secrets of the
[53:30] hearts to the people remember this was a
[53:32] prophetic Ministry that came and it will
[53:34] never have another one come there'll
[53:36] never be another messenger like this
[53:38] messenger can you say Amen so we're not
[53:40] looking for another one there's got to
[53:42] be somebody that would turn the hearts
[53:43] of the people back and that one has
[53:45] already come and so I want to just say
[53:47] this just as a background when you look
[53:50] ahead and start looking for something to
[53:51] come well something Great's going to
[53:53] happen and then I'll have faith for a
[53:55] Rapture something Great's going to
[53:56] happen and then I can go to church and
[53:58] well come on somebody listen there's
[54:00] nothing more that needs to happen the
[54:02] word has come and called out a bride you
[54:05] are she can I say that
[54:08] tonight so if we just go on down here
[54:10] brother Brandon would say it like this
[54:11] in the spoken word is the Original Seed
[54:13] he said High breeding first started in
[54:15] Eden started in Genesis it's the
[54:16] beginning that's where and it ends up
[54:18] over here in Revelation at the second
[54:20] coming of Christ he said now remember
[54:22] correctly that's why each generation has
[54:25] its own Revival it gets a chance at the
[54:28] word can you say Amen every one of you
[54:30] had to have a chance of the word of this
[54:31] day God would not put you here and not
[54:34] send a word to call you out can you say
[54:36] Amen because God when God sent Luther to
[54:39] the Earth there was a people that were
[54:41] ready to hear the words of Luther and
[54:43] they would follow the message of that
[54:44] hour can you say Amen Wesley would come
[54:46] along and there had to be a people that
[54:48] was ready to follow the message of
[54:50] Wesley now the ones that denominated the
[54:52] Lutheran then would actually turn down
[54:54] the true word that that because they
[54:56] didn't see it why it was blinded to them
[54:59] because they were still living in a
[55:00] light from another day they were living
[55:02] in the time of Luther and they failed to
[55:04] walk in the light of their day now
[55:06] Wesley would do the same thing Wesley
[55:08] would come along and he had a truth for
[55:10] that hour remember he would call out the
[55:12] people for that hour and they would come
[55:13] to light but remember Pentecost would do
[55:15] the same thing 1906 1906 Pentecost that
[55:18] was a real move of God we don't do away
[55:20] with any of these things sanctification
[55:22] justification the baptism of the Holy
[55:24] Ghost and and the tongues these are none
[55:26] of these things were wrong but they
[55:28] would stop there and fail to see the
[55:30] very light that was going forward see
[55:33] they would come out of a little bit they
[55:35] would come out of Darkness into a little
[55:36] bit of light and then they would stop
[55:37] and then they would die it was a cycle
[55:39] of Revival and death can you say amen
[55:42] and so this bride will not partake in a
[55:45] death in their Revival this revival is
[55:48] going to go right on until the coming of
[55:49] the Lord can you say Amen we are not
[55:51] going to die because I tell you what
[55:54] every age might have had their Revival
[55:56] and what they did they would denominate
[55:57] and they would die now a prophet would
[55:59] come right back and say this bride will
[56:01] not denominate oh there may be some
[56:03] people in the message that denominated
[56:05] but this bride will not
[56:09] denominate so you can't die because
[56:12] that's what brings death if you look
[56:14] back in the Garden of Eden and you think
[56:15] back and Eve was there and all she had
[56:17] to do listen they had everything perfect
[56:19] in the Garden of Eden they had no they
[56:21] had no troubles they had no sickness no
[56:23] worry no stress no wedding planning
[56:25] nothing like that everything was
[56:28] perfect everything was perfect
[56:30] Congratulations by the
[56:33] way but everything was good and then and
[56:37] then there's one thing that she's not
[56:38] allowed to do don't touch this one tree
[56:40] and I know no doubt Adam said now Eve
[56:43] the Lord God has spoken and said you can
[56:45] have everything you can have the
[56:46] unlimited Amazon cards you can have the
[56:49] whole bank account everything's yours
[56:51] every everything every tree in the
[56:53] garden every fruit every vegetable every
[56:56] every herb everything is yours but don't
[56:58] touch this one
[57:00] thing and one word would cause death to
[57:03] the entire human race do you see how
[57:05] important the opening of the word is
[57:07] because now you can see the full word
[57:09] restored and we don't have to wonder
[57:11] about it we can see it and there will be
[57:14] no more death why because this eve will
[57:17] not fall can you say amen and she was
[57:19] taken from the side of her Adam can you
[57:21] say Amen she's from the very side of
[57:23] Christ himself but she cannot because
[57:26] God knew when the first one was made
[57:28] there'd be a fall but this eve cannot
[57:31] fall listen God knew that there had to
[57:33] come to Christ to restore a fallen Eve
[57:36] but you can't fall that ought to give
[57:38] somebody a shouting room here tonight
[57:40] you cannot fall
[57:43] away I liked how a brother said at a
[57:45] youth camp here a few months back he
[57:47] said you may fall down but you can't
[57:49] fall away you may make mistakes but that
[57:51] don't mean you ain't bride get right
[57:53] back up and keep trying just because you
[57:55] made a mistake doesn't take you out of
[57:57] this remember brother Brandon would
[57:58] scream and say get back and step he
[58:00] didn't say well that one's not bright he
[58:02] said get back in line with the word of
[58:03] God just because you've Fallen don't
[58:06] stay down but get right back up and say
[58:08] I believe the voice of God for this day
[58:11] has restored my heart
[58:13] back God has called us for such a time
[58:16] as this it's an open book time it's an
[58:19] Awakening of the Bride time it's a time
[58:21] to wake up Sleeping Giant wipe the sleep
[58:24] from your eyes and recognize your day
[58:26] and its
[58:28] message let me get back to my notes here
[58:30] before I just preach and forget them
[58:33] brother Brandon would say like this he
[58:35] said now get on down here he said now a
[58:37] Revival is not bringing in new members
[58:40] but it's to revive what you have it's
[58:42] nice to see new members but that's not
[58:45] what we're really look listen we we need
[58:46] to focus on Outreach I absolutely
[58:48] believe in that I I'm so thrilled when I
[58:50] see people coming back not switching
[58:52] churches but coming back coming back you
[58:54] know it's good to go where you want to
[58:55] go but let me tell you when you see
[58:57] people that ain't in church brother Matt
[58:58] it does something for you they've been
[58:59] out there and they've been in drugs
[59:01] they've been in alcohol some of you I
[59:03] guarantee you've been there but where
[59:04] are you tonight sitting together in
[59:07] Heavenly places hearing the word of God
[59:09] listen I know where you've been but
[59:10] listen that that does not define you
[59:13] that does not define you for tribulation
[59:16] you don't have to go through tribulation
[59:17] because of your past a blood that still
[59:20] works has covered your
[59:22] sin you don't have to worry about it why
[59:25] because you've been called this is your
[59:27] season this is your time this is your
[59:29] revival can I say it like that the bride
[59:32] has got to have an Awakening the bride
[59:34] has got to have a Revival and brother
[59:36] Brandon would actually deal with this in
[59:37] the third seal and he would say the
[59:38] bride hasn't had a Revival yet but then
[59:40] he goes on he doesn't stop there and I'm
[59:44] so thankful he did because so many are
[59:46] still looking for a Revival or or or
[59:48] more word to be come back and be
[59:50] revealed listen the word has been
[59:51] revealed we have Revelations 10:7 for a
[59:54] reason it has been revealed bu the book
[59:56] is open the seals have been taken off
[59:59] well can you say Amen now I want you to
[1:00:02] notice there's a different in in a
[1:00:03] national Revival in a bride Revival
[1:00:05] brother Ram said it's over for the for
[1:00:06] the N for the national Revival there
[1:00:08] will be no more an American Revival he
[1:00:10] said she has been condemned and and he
[1:00:12] said that's thus sayith the Lord he said
[1:00:14] he said her time will run out someday he
[1:00:16] said she's on her downward move right
[1:00:18] now she'll never come back again can you
[1:00:20] say Amen she's gone that's right she's
[1:00:23] been gone since 1956 when she condemned
[1:00:26] and turned away God from the great
[1:00:27] Revival hours now that's Doom and Gloom
[1:00:29] to the world but he's not talking to the
[1:00:32] bride we're going to go somewhere is
[1:00:33] this okay is this okay so far all right
[1:00:36] he said now that's what's the reason
[1:00:38] today that the revivals that we're
[1:00:39] supposed to have the denominational
[1:00:41] revivals we haven't had a real stirring
[1:00:43] no sir don't think we got revivals we
[1:00:45] haven't oh they've got millions and
[1:00:47] millions and millions of church members
[1:00:48] but not a Revival nowhere the bride
[1:00:51] hasn't had a Revival yet now remember
[1:00:53] 1963 the third seal we'll get some okay
[1:00:56] I'm not I'm not putting quotes against
[1:00:58] each other by the way but a prophet had
[1:01:00] progressive revelation a prophet would
[1:01:02] look back he could look back after he
[1:01:04] preached it and say I didn't even know
[1:01:05] what I was preaching I didn't even
[1:01:07] recognize the time it happened but he
[1:01:09] then he would tell the people that what
[1:01:10] they had missed was The Awakening of the
[1:01:12] bride and so he goes on he said they've
[1:01:14] got all kinds of church members and
[1:01:16] they've got all kinds of people and and
[1:01:18] he said but the bride hasn't had Revival
[1:01:19] yet it'll take those seven unknown
[1:01:21] Thunders back there to wake her up again
[1:01:23] can you say Amen now just because I
[1:01:26] believe brother Andrew said this before
[1:01:27] just because somebody preached the
[1:01:28] Thunders wrong a prophet already
[1:01:29] preached it right yes sir and so we
[1:01:31] don't have to be scared to say what a
[1:01:32] prophet said we don't have to be scared
[1:01:34] to preach all that a prophet said we
[1:01:36] don't have to worry about some false
[1:01:39] Doctrine Thunders movement that is tried
[1:01:41] to creep its way into the message and be
[1:01:43] under the umbrella of the message of the
[1:01:44] hour and say this is what brother brand
[1:01:46] meant I know what he meant because I can
[1:01:48] read what he
[1:01:49] said and so I don't have to worry about
[1:01:51] well I'm I'm preaching new Thunders
[1:01:53] doctor no I believe that the Thunders
[1:01:55] the Mysteries contained in those Seven
[1:01:57] Seals that's what a prophet said and he
[1:01:59] said it would take those Thunders to
[1:02:01] wake up a bride if the Thunders have
[1:02:03] uttered the bride's awake can you say
[1:02:05] Amen you're not I tell you what we're
[1:02:08] awake here tonight we don't have to
[1:02:09] worry we're not we're not going back to
[1:02:11] another time where where the where the
[1:02:13] bride has got to be awoke with another
[1:02:15] message or you know brother Matt I I I
[1:02:16] don't I'm not coming with a new message
[1:02:18] you're not coming with a new message all
[1:02:19] these evangelists and ministers and
[1:02:21] pastors that brother Matt brings in here
[1:02:22] they're not coming with a message of
[1:02:24] their own but they're coming to say that
[1:02:26] a prophet already came and he came to
[1:02:28] restore a bride and we're participating
[1:02:31] in the Revival called a bride's Revival
[1:02:34] and it is a word Revival it's not built
[1:02:36] on emotion it's not built on a man it's
[1:02:39] not built on just a personality but it
[1:02:41] is built on thus sayeth the
[1:02:44] Lord so we're looking not for another
[1:02:47] Revival but we are in revival can you
[1:02:50] say Amen well I tell you they're looking
[1:02:52] for Revival in all the Pentecostal
[1:02:53] churches if you hadn't spoken tongues
[1:02:55] you don't have listen here tonight we're
[1:02:57] looking for a word restoration and
[1:03:00] that's what we want to see in the lives
[1:03:01] of the people well am I in Revival
[1:03:03] brother Joel if you're under this
[1:03:05] messenger and you have accepted the
[1:03:07] message for your day you are in the
[1:03:09] bride's Revival don't let nobody put you
[1:03:12] out of it you're in it you are the
[1:03:15] bride's
[1:03:16] Revival well can you say Amen we're
[1:03:18] going to go on down a little farther
[1:03:20] before I I get stopped and I end up
[1:03:22] being here too late brother Joe he said
[1:03:24] now this messenger m M 4 Revelations
[1:03:26] 10:7 is going to do two things according
[1:03:28] to Malachi 4 he will turn the hearts of
[1:03:30] the children to the fathers and two he
[1:03:32] will reveal the mysteries of the seven
[1:03:34] thunders in Revelations 10 which are the
[1:03:36] revelations contained in the Seven Seals
[1:03:38] that's in the church H book now remember
[1:03:41] there was still healing campaigns going
[1:03:43] on there was still revivals they would
[1:03:46] call them going on they would still have
[1:03:48] prayer lines and pray for the sick and
[1:03:49] we still do because it's still part of
[1:03:51] the restoration message well can you
[1:03:54] sayen we don't do away with anything
[1:03:56] that has been restored to the church but
[1:03:58] remember the focus the focus is on the
[1:04:00] Awakening of the Bride to hear the word
[1:04:03] of God and become the word herself can
[1:04:06] you say amen and so he says here he says
[1:04:09] everywhere now there's no Revival
[1:04:10] everybody's complaining ministers crying
[1:04:12] this is 1964 recognizing your day in
[1:04:14] this message he said fast pray fast pray
[1:04:16] sound a trumpet how many reads it he's
[1:04:18] talking about the herald of his coming
[1:04:19] brother Jack Moore's magazine he say
[1:04:21] it's a great thing good people he wasn't
[1:04:23] condemning the people they just hadn't
[1:04:24] recognized the light that had come yet
[1:04:26] so we're not listen when you go out here
[1:04:28] witnessing we're not telling these
[1:04:29] people that you're not bride we don't
[1:04:31] know who is and who isn't there could be
[1:04:33] some sitting out there on the street
[1:04:34] corner tonight smoking and drinking and
[1:04:36] and doing all kinds of hard drugs or
[1:04:38] whatever and that may be the very bride
[1:04:40] of Jesus Christ that could be the last
[1:04:42] one we're looking for but we've got to
[1:04:44] do our work and go out there and just
[1:04:46] seow seed and and those that are will
[1:04:48] come maybe you say well I'm not seeing a
[1:04:51] lot of fruits right now well there's not
[1:04:52] a lot left but there will be somebody
[1:04:55] that'll come come and this bride will go
[1:04:57] in a Rapture can you say Amen we do
[1:05:00] believe in a rapture we do believe in
[1:05:02] Awakening of the Bride but she's got to
[1:05:03] be ready for the Rapture how's he going
[1:05:05] to come for sleeping bride he's going to
[1:05:07] come for somebody who is awake and has
[1:05:09] recognized the hour that she's living
[1:05:13] in he will not catch you asleep but
[1:05:15] somebody's going to be working
[1:05:16] somebody's going to be out doing
[1:05:18] something somebody's going to be
[1:05:19] preaching the gospel when it comes for
[1:05:20] you can you say amen he said everywhere
[1:05:23] now there's no Revival he said we're not
[1:05:25] tooo they say we're not too late yet why
[1:05:27] do they do that why do they want a Great
[1:05:29] Awakening they're crying believing that
[1:05:30] there will be an Awakening they're good
[1:05:32] people why is it why have they what have
[1:05:35] they done they have not recognized The
[1:05:37] Awakening of the
[1:05:39] Bride good people men who were sitting
[1:05:41] in the message men who were hearing a
[1:05:44] prophet preach and they had not
[1:05:46] recognized The Awakening can you say
[1:05:49] Amen they had not recognized The
[1:05:51] Awakening of the Bride but listen that's
[1:05:52] because there's got to be something in
[1:05:54] you to rec recognize it when it comes
[1:05:56] across your path the fact that you're
[1:05:58] here tonight is not by chance it's not
[1:06:02] because your family's here it's because
[1:06:04] God chose you and put you in this very
[1:06:07] spot here tonight God did not listen God
[1:06:09] did not put you in Luther's age for a
[1:06:11] reason he did not put you in Wesley's
[1:06:13] age for a reason he didn't put you in
[1:06:15] the 1906 Pentecostal age for a reason
[1:06:18] but there would come a bride age there
[1:06:20] would come a bride time there would
[1:06:21] become an Awakening somebody had to be
[1:06:24] ready for the message of the power to
[1:06:26] turn their hearts
[1:06:28] back God knew he couldn't come God knew
[1:06:30] he couldn't send that messenger in in
[1:06:32] the other ages why because there was
[1:06:34] nobody to accept the message in that age
[1:06:36] but he had to come a little bit of light
[1:06:37] at a time and it's kind of like
[1:06:39] witnessing to people sometimes you can't
[1:06:40] give them everything it once you got to
[1:06:42] give him a little bit and a little bit
[1:06:43] more and and listen brother Brandon when
[1:06:45] he came he had to do the same thing had
[1:06:46] to be a first pull had to be a second
[1:06:48] pull and then would come the third pole
[1:06:50] opening of the word he had to get your
[1:06:52] attention to wake you up little bride
[1:06:54] before he could say come out of her come
[1:06:57] out of those denominational systems get
[1:06:59] away from those walls get ready it's
[1:07:01] Rapture
[1:07:02] time he had to wake you up he had to
[1:07:04] catch your attention and then you had to
[1:07:07] be awoken by the word can you say amen
[1:07:10] amen they fail to recognize now the
[1:07:13] awake the The Awakening of the Bride the
[1:07:15] bride's Revival it happens when the true
[1:07:18] church the bride begins to line up for
[1:07:21] the word of her age can you say Amen so
[1:07:25] she's not not just lining up to a part
[1:07:27] of the word because then that would be
[1:07:29] just like the first Eve did well I've
[1:07:31] accepted of the goodness of God I've
[1:07:33] been in the Garden of Eden I've seen all
[1:07:35] these great things I've done all the
[1:07:37] listen I've seen the I've seen God he
[1:07:39] maybe she she saw all kinds of creation
[1:07:41] maybe Adam was over there speaking
[1:07:42] things into existence for her and she
[1:07:44] saw the spoken word she saw the sign in
[1:07:46] the hand well come on somebody she saw
[1:07:49] all the Mysteries and she saw that this
[1:07:51] Prophet was going to come and everything
[1:07:53] but she missed him when she come because
[1:07:54] she disbel one word and this Pride
[1:07:58] cannot do that same thing why because
[1:08:01] she was not she was not promised to fall
[1:08:03] but it was promised there she would not
[1:08:05] fall and so when the word comes and he
[1:08:07] says stay in line with the word she
[1:08:09] doesn't fall by disbelieving one word
[1:08:12] but she lines up to the word of the hour
[1:08:14] can you say Amen so when a prophet says
[1:08:17] it this brid will say Amen to it oh that
[1:08:19] flesh May fight you listen I'm not
[1:08:21] talking about flesh conversion here
[1:08:22] tonight I'm talking about something
[1:08:24] beyond that flesh I'm talking about
[1:08:26] something behind that flesh that flesh
[1:08:28] will do all kinds of well come on
[1:08:30] somebody that flesh will fail you every
[1:08:32] day that flesh will come against you
[1:08:34] that flesh will do things that you never
[1:08:35] dreamed it could do but God saw you in
[1:08:38] spite of the flesh you're carrying
[1:08:41] around he saw you when you were so low
[1:08:43] down you couldn't sit in the house of
[1:08:45] God he saw you when you were so low down
[1:08:47] oh come on somebody maybe nobody else
[1:08:49] has been there but I've been there I've
[1:08:51] been in a place where I couldn't have
[1:08:52] sit in church because my heart condemned
[1:08:54] me so bad I've been in a a place where
[1:08:55] there was no way I could sit and enjoy
[1:08:57] the presence of God but thanks be to God
[1:09:00] tonight I can stand here I was a sinner
[1:09:03] but I've been saved by the grace of God
[1:09:05] I've been called for the message of the
[1:09:07] hour I'm not looking for another message
[1:09:10] I'm not looking for another Awakening
[1:09:11] I'm not looking for another Revival I'm
[1:09:13] in the Revival it has called me it has
[1:09:16] changed me how do I know it's not just
[1:09:18] an emotion an emotion cannot change your
[1:09:20] life an emotion cannot make you act
[1:09:22] different oh it can make you act a
[1:09:24] little crazy when you're in the food but
[1:09:26] listen it will not hold you outside of
[1:09:28] the church walls but the word will hold
[1:09:31] you when the emotion is not there no
[1:09:35] longer when it feels like on Monday
[1:09:37] morning you can't even get up and go no
[1:09:39] farther the word still works brother Joe
[1:09:42] when it feels like you can't preach
[1:09:43] another sermon the word still works
[1:09:46] there's got to be some young men brother
[1:09:47] matth that's going to take this message
[1:09:49] and keep it on until the coming of the
[1:09:51] Lord the word still works when you've
[1:09:54] lost a loved one the word still works
[1:09:57] amen yes sir because just because they
[1:10:00] didn't go in the Rapture with us
[1:10:01] remember they're already going to be up
[1:10:02] waiting for us oh come on somebody just
[1:10:05] because you've lost love oh I wish they
[1:10:06] went the Rapture they're going to rise
[1:10:08] first and then we're going to be caught
[1:10:10] up with our loved ones to meet him in
[1:10:12] the air the word still works you telling
[1:10:16] me anything else is going to call us
[1:10:18] from the graves except for the word
[1:10:19] itself no it is the word it is the very
[1:10:22] word that has been spoken it is the
[1:10:24] voice that is in you last time I was
[1:10:25] here I believe I dealt with it on the
[1:10:27] voice of authority listen that is in you
[1:10:29] when you speak the devil trembles when
[1:10:31] you speak all hell shakes why because
[1:10:34] you have a voice of authority because
[1:10:36] you are the Bride of Jesus Christ and he
[1:10:40] already knows you know the devil already
[1:10:41] knows that you can't fall the devil
[1:10:44] already knows it he's going to do
[1:10:45] everything he can to stop you but he
[1:10:47] knows you can't fall away oh he might
[1:10:50] think he's got you when you fall down he
[1:10:52] might think he got you when you backslid
[1:10:54] that one time he might think he got you
[1:10:56] when you were serving the devil out
[1:10:58] there in the bar stool but he didn't
[1:10:59] have you why because God knew all the
[1:11:02] time Brother David you're one of mine
[1:11:04] you can't be
[1:11:07] lost God knew it all the time in spite
[1:11:10] of my Humanity he saw a seat of God and
[1:11:14] called me bride well can you say Amen in
[1:11:17] spite of me he called me Bride In Spite
[1:11:20] of me when I deserved everything he took
[1:11:24] when I deserved and I deserved every
[1:11:26] beating he took I deserved every bruise
[1:11:29] I deserved the spear I deserve the crown
[1:11:32] but I get guess what he gave me he gave
[1:11:34] me a home in heaven why because he saw
[1:11:37] who you had the potential to be even
[1:11:40] when you weren't nothing at all well can
[1:11:42] you say
[1:11:43] Amen it's a cycle of Revival and death
[1:11:47] it's a cycle the world goes through this
[1:11:49] the world you'll see a church grow and
[1:11:50] then they that that's just part of
[1:11:52] that's just part of what we go through
[1:11:54] you'll see churches grow grow and then
[1:11:55] they they seem to go through dips and
[1:11:57] you you you'll have a great service and
[1:11:58] then the Devil comes in and everybody's
[1:12:00] in a bad mood and you got to fight
[1:12:01] through it and then you finally break
[1:12:02] open you're like well we could have had
[1:12:04] this for the last two hours if we' had
[1:12:05] just come in prayed up in the right
[1:12:07] Spirit no but the devil fought you all
[1:12:08] the way to church but see that's just a
[1:12:10] Revival here Among Us that's just having
[1:12:12] a good time in church but the word held
[1:12:14] you when you didn't feel like shouting
[1:12:16] the word held you when you felt like
[1:12:18] backsliding the word held you well come
[1:12:20] on somebody the word held you when you
[1:12:23] wanted to lash out at that person you
[1:12:24] work with well praise the Lord I've been
[1:12:27] there brother Joe you ever been there I
[1:12:29] I've been there listen there's some bad
[1:12:30] people you're going to rub shoulders
[1:12:31] with there's some people that don't even
[1:12:33] care about God and they'll laugh at the
[1:12:35] way you dress and they'll laugh at the
[1:12:36] way you talk and they'll laugh at who
[1:12:38] you are but God didn't laugh at you he
[1:12:40] put his favor on you and called you
[1:12:46] bride so when the world's laughing
[1:12:48] you're going to be caught up I don't
[1:12:50] want to say we got the last laugh cuz
[1:12:52] that sounds kind of arrogant but I
[1:12:53] wanted to say this I wish they'd all go
[1:12:55] with me but I'm going anyway I'm going
[1:12:58] on with Jesus I don't care if it's just
[1:12:59] me and Jesus but I believe if you're
[1:13:01] sitting in a church tonight that is
[1:13:03] preaching the message of the hour then I
[1:13:05] want to just go ahead and tell you
[1:13:06] something has on the inside of you that
[1:13:09] has put you here and I believe tonight
[1:13:11] that every person in here why would I
[1:13:13] believe anything different every person
[1:13:15] in here I believe you to be a part of
[1:13:17] this bride I would not hold condemnation
[1:13:20] over this church I am not here to preach
[1:13:22] you out of the Bride I'm here to tell
[1:13:24] you wake up little prde this is your
[1:13:29] Revival if you can accept this end time
[1:13:31] Revival if you can accept this end time
[1:13:33] message then I say there's something on
[1:13:35] the inside of you you may not even
[1:13:37] realize who you are but God already saw
[1:13:40] who you were well the mark he saw you
[1:13:43] when you didn't have a dime to your name
[1:13:44] and he said you know what you're my
[1:13:46] bride he doesn't go by status or money
[1:13:48] he doesn't go by who your family was
[1:13:50] listen we got to break those Cycles
[1:13:52] every once in a while your daddy may
[1:13:53] have been a bad person your mom may have
[1:13:55] been a bad person your grandparents may
[1:13:57] have been bad people but God has called
[1:13:59] somebody who's going to break that cycle
[1:14:02] and be called Bride Can you say Amen
[1:14:05] brother R goes on down here and he says
[1:14:09] Now history keeps repeating itself in
[1:14:11] the generation of Israel we see Revival
[1:14:13] in one generation only to see the fires
[1:14:15] fade in the next in the third generation
[1:14:18] Embers may be glowing slightly but in
[1:14:20] the fourth there may be no vestage
[1:14:22] whatsoever of that original flame and
[1:14:24] then God lights the fire again aren't
[1:14:26] you glad he did it for you when it
[1:14:28] looked like you were going to be the one
[1:14:30] to finally burn out in that cycle and
[1:14:32] God went ahead and just put a whole new
[1:14:34] flame in you can you say amen he said
[1:14:37] then God lights the fire again and the
[1:14:38] same process is repeated it is simply
[1:14:41] the manifestation of the truth that God
[1:14:44] has no grandchildren salvation is not
[1:14:46] passed on by natural birth any more than
[1:14:49] there is any truth to the apostolic
[1:14:51] succession it isn't in the word like
[1:14:53] that you start out with truth truly Born
[1:14:55] Again Believers and when the next
[1:14:57] Generation comes along they're no longer
[1:14:59] just plain Christians but they they have
[1:15:01] taken a denominational name and now
[1:15:02] Baptist Methodist Etc that is exactly
[1:15:05] what they are too they're not Christians
[1:15:06] you have to be born of the will of God
[1:15:08] not the will of man to be saved but
[1:15:10] these folks are all coming together now
[1:15:12] by the will of man I don't say that some
[1:15:13] of them aren't right with God not for a
[1:15:15] minute do I say that but the original
[1:15:17] fire has died down you won't find hardly
[1:15:20] any fire in a Lutheran church today even
[1:15:22] though at one time that was the church
[1:15:24] on fire I I was around the Westland
[1:15:26] Methodist growing up the Westlands were
[1:15:27] good people and I remember being in
[1:15:29] their meetings and in their camps and
[1:15:31] and they had a little bit of fire left
[1:15:32] and if you go there today there's
[1:15:34] nothing left there's no word hardly left
[1:15:36] and they'll fight you on on trinitarian
[1:15:38] I mean they they're just so trinitarian
[1:15:39] and they could never see they could
[1:15:41] never see the the the Jesus name baptism
[1:15:43] they could never come to the Pentecostal
[1:15:45] age and they would actually go against
[1:15:47] it and and call it all kinds of evil
[1:15:49] names and they're the ones that would
[1:15:50] call them holy rollers and things and
[1:15:51] these were shouters these were people
[1:15:53] that didn't look dead but they didn't
[1:15:54] denied the move of God can you say amen
[1:15:57] and so when you're around that you
[1:15:58] realize that then the next Generation
[1:16:00] comes along there's nothing to hold them
[1:16:01] but I'd like to go ahead and say that
[1:16:03] I've seen some people in this message
[1:16:05] where the grandparents might have been
[1:16:06] dead it's 12:00 and I've seen the kids
[1:16:09] find a Revival why because a prophet
[1:16:11] said every generation will get their
[1:16:13] chance at the word every generation is
[1:16:16] going to have their Revival every
[1:16:18] generation is not going to go back and
[1:16:20] just let the fires burn out but every
[1:16:22] generation needs to have a word revival
[1:16:26] can you say Amen so when the young
[1:16:27] people are sitting there and you say
[1:16:29] well what about the young people don't
[1:16:30] worry about them young people if they're
[1:16:31] sitting here in the house of God I'd say
[1:16:33] that's the best place for them why
[1:16:35] because this is the place where they can
[1:16:36] hear the opening of the word and the
[1:16:38] word can cause Revival in the hearts of
[1:16:41] our young people well can you say Amen
[1:16:43] I'm not here to just preach another
[1:16:45] Baptist Doctrine or another Methodist
[1:16:47] Doctrine but I'm here to say God is got
[1:16:49] a people who are going to believe every
[1:16:50] word that he spoke everything that he
[1:16:52] said in this Bible everything that the
[1:16:54] messenger would come all those loose
[1:16:56] ends we're going to believe every word
[1:16:59] of it can you say Amen I'm not here to
[1:17:02] add something to the message I'm here to
[1:17:04] Proclaim that I'm going to say what a
[1:17:05] messenger said I'm not here to start a
[1:17:07] new doctrine of the Thunders I'm not
[1:17:09] here to tell you there's going to be a
[1:17:10] tent and there's going to be a return
[1:17:11] and when that happens then you can be
[1:17:12] saved no your Revival is on right now I
[1:17:15] don't say there ain't some good people
[1:17:17] that believe like that but I got to tell
[1:17:18] you something they failed to recognize
[1:17:20] the Awakening of the Bride but to you
[1:17:23] who have not failed to see it you you
[1:17:25] are in
[1:17:27] Revival that's why you can go to some
[1:17:29] message churches and you wonder are they
[1:17:31] message they're so dead you can't say
[1:17:33] Amen well can you say Amen I'm not for
[1:17:36] that at all I think that's just trying
[1:17:38] to take the people right back into a
[1:17:40] well I might as well say it you all are
[1:17:42] okay you all ain't like that so I can
[1:17:44] just be free here listen there's some
[1:17:45] Churches you can't get an amen out of
[1:17:47] them you can say you can say every every
[1:17:49] every catchphrase in the message every
[1:17:51] quote that just makes you just stir up
[1:17:53] you could get in there and you could
[1:17:55] find all the quotes that makes the
[1:17:56] people shout a little bit and you could
[1:17:58] just really be like I'm just going to
[1:17:59] get these people hyped up you can't move
[1:18:02] them if there's nothing on the inside to
[1:18:04] move
[1:18:05] them you can preach your best message
[1:18:07] brother Joe and if there's nothing on
[1:18:09] the inside there's no quickening power
[1:18:11] can you say Amen but what this word does
[1:18:14] it actually meets well come on somebody
[1:18:16] it actually meets with the seed on the
[1:18:18] inside and that seed when it hears the
[1:18:21] word of God it's just like that Lily in
[1:18:23] the mud it may be in the mud it may not
[1:18:26] even see the light yet but it's growing
[1:18:28] anyway because there's a Revival that is
[1:18:31] moving it up to maturity and full
[1:18:35] light can you say Amen so that's not
[1:18:38] what we're doing we're not over here
[1:18:39] trying to say well we need to work
[1:18:40] everybody no that's not it if if the
[1:18:42] word is preached and you can sit there
[1:18:43] dead is
[1:18:45] 12:00 that's on
[1:18:47] you well can you say amen amen because
[1:18:50] when the word is preached there's
[1:18:51] something on the inside of the Bride
[1:18:53] that will respond to it I'm not talking
[1:18:56] about everybody responding the same way
[1:18:58] I watched people sit there in a service
[1:19:00] and they just cry and maybe brother Joe
[1:19:02] that I've watched them sit there and
[1:19:04] they and maybe they just be you could
[1:19:05] just see God working on their lives and
[1:19:06] they never said a word I'm not talking
[1:19:08] about somebody has to be the loudest
[1:19:09] shouter in the church I'm not talking
[1:19:11] about that at all but there needs to be
[1:19:12] a moving on the inside there needs to be
[1:19:15] a growing on the inside and then what
[1:19:17] you really know it by is when you watch
[1:19:19] them out there in the world you'll watch
[1:19:20] what the word did in church you'll watch
[1:19:23] what the word did when they said down
[1:19:24] and started listening to tapes again
[1:19:26] you'll watch what the word did when they
[1:19:28] picked up that bible and took the dust
[1:19:29] off of it and started reading it again
[1:19:31] you'll see a life behind it it won't
[1:19:34] just be a shout but it will be a change
[1:19:36] on the inside that will start showing on
[1:19:38] the outside or try to keep them people
[1:19:40] quiet one time when you recognize your
[1:19:43] day in its message try to keep them
[1:19:45] people quiet why because theyve
[1:19:47] recognized that we're not dead any
[1:19:49] longer but we are in a bride's revival
[1:19:52] can you say Amen we're not over here
[1:19:55] wondering what's going to happen how big
[1:19:57] is this tent going to be well I hope I'm
[1:19:59] okay here tonight if I'm stepping on
[1:20:01] your toes I guess well you probably
[1:20:03] wouldn't be here in this church if you
[1:20:05] believe like that that's right so we'll
[1:20:06] just say it anyway but if you don't
[1:20:08] don't let that doctor never come in here
[1:20:09] don't let that doctor ever get a hold of
[1:20:11] you some people try to listen just
[1:20:13] believe the word of God just believe the
[1:20:15] message of the hour stay with what a
[1:20:17] prophet said just believe that the third
[1:20:19] pole is on for the bride why because he
[1:20:22] said it's the opening of the word he
[1:20:23] said the Thunder already preached he
[1:20:25] said well come on somebody and if
[1:20:27] they've already if they were there if
[1:20:29] they were there and they were preaching
[1:20:31] them themselves and he could look back
[1:20:32] and say the reason that the other groups
[1:20:34] were not catching it because they failed
[1:20:36] to uh to see The Awakening then I would
[1:20:38] like to just go ahead and say to you if
[1:20:40] they were dead because they couldn't see
[1:20:42] the Awakening then we are alive because
[1:20:44] of the Awakening then we are we are woke
[1:20:47] up we are no longer dead listen that the
[1:20:50] bride in the beginning was in Adam the
[1:20:52] whole time but she had to be created
[1:20:56] she had to be woke
[1:20:57] up as long as she was just a part as
[1:21:00] long as she was just in Adam there was
[1:21:02] nothing that she could do there was
[1:21:04] nothing she couldn't even be a help me
[1:21:05] to him she could she had no voice she
[1:21:07] had no body but when God actually would
[1:21:09] take her out of the Flesh of Adam and
[1:21:11] make that bride then she could actually
[1:21:14] have full Authority on Earth just like
[1:21:16] he did what can you say man she was him
[1:21:18] brother bam said bone of his bone flesh
[1:21:20] of his flesh she was a full part of him
[1:21:23] now what about the bride today he what
[1:21:25] about well come on somebody what about
[1:21:27] the bride now if you have seen who you
[1:21:30] are in the scriptures then brother
[1:21:32] brandom said when you recognize who you
[1:21:34] are then we'll be gone I think it's time
[1:21:36] the bride recognizes that you're not
[1:21:39] just another church that you're not just
[1:21:41] another having a good time Pentecostal
[1:21:43] bunch of people but you are a word bride
[1:21:45] that is coming in line with the word and
[1:21:47] the Rapture is upon us yes sir the
[1:21:50] Rapture is upon us I I I know I know
[1:21:52] people's looking for more but we're not
[1:21:54] looking for Nothing But The Rapture
[1:21:56] brother Ram said I don't see nothing
[1:21:58] recognizing your day in this message he
[1:21:59] said I don't see nothing left as a
[1:22:00] Christian but the coming of the Lord I
[1:22:02] want to say tonight look up little bride
[1:22:04] your Redemption draweth nigh it's not
[1:22:08] something you got to go get prepped for
[1:22:10] and you got to have another evangelist
[1:22:11] in for your pastor don't have to preach
[1:22:13] a certain message at a certain time but
[1:22:15] what the what what the pastor is going
[1:22:17] to do is stand there and preach message
[1:22:19] after message because that word will
[1:22:22] touch somebody's heart and cause them to
[1:22:24] take another step closer to a body
[1:22:26] change when brother Mark's in the Pulpit
[1:22:28] or one of these other ministers were in
[1:22:29] the Pulpit listen they're just standing
[1:22:31] here trying to portray to you trying to
[1:22:33] give the message to you that has already
[1:22:35] called you to be restored back and so
[1:22:38] when the message is preached it has to
[1:22:40] do what it was intended to do can you
[1:22:43] say Amen this word was not called to
[1:22:45] kill you but the word was called to
[1:22:47] restore you the word was come the word
[1:22:50] came so that you wouldn't have to die
[1:22:52] out like another denomination but it
[1:22:55] came to have a living bride with a
[1:22:57] living word at a time of rapture can you
[1:22:59] say Amen so this bride is now ready can
[1:23:03] you say Amen well where's the rest of
[1:23:04] them at I don't know but any day now
[1:23:06] brother Joe it could be in the morning
[1:23:08] it could be tonight it could be any day
[1:23:10] now you say well we got a different
[1:23:12] president the Lord ain't coming oh be
[1:23:14] careful with that that's a trap of the
[1:23:16] devil that's a trap of the devil you say
[1:23:18] well you say well listen well I don't
[1:23:20] know what you think about politics but
[1:23:22] I'm just going to tell you just because
[1:23:23] you think all people peace everything's
[1:23:25] great watch it that's when destruction
[1:23:27] comes on the earth and the bride will
[1:23:29] not be here in the destruction well can
[1:23:32] you say am man he said the bride
[1:23:33] wouldn't stay through that listen there
[1:23:35] may be more who knows the world's going
[1:23:37] to get worse and worse you say well the
[1:23:38] squeeze is coming I say the squeeze is
[1:23:40] on for the bride well can you say Amen
[1:23:43] the squeez is on go out of here and you
[1:23:45] see they laugh at a young lady going to
[1:23:47] school with long hair and a skirt on but
[1:23:50] they won't laugh at the person that
[1:23:51] calls themselves a cat
[1:23:55] you think this world's not crazy it's
[1:23:56] crazy but the bride is just coming
[1:23:59] together they realize how crazy this
[1:24:01] world really is and when you see the
[1:24:03] destruction you see the Revival over and
[1:24:06] you realize there's only one place left
[1:24:07] of safety that's in the message of the
[1:24:11] hour we're not looking for another
[1:24:13] denomination for a place of
[1:24:16] safety I've got to get a little farther
[1:24:18] here brother Joe before I run out of
[1:24:19] time brother Ram said that cycle of
[1:24:21] Revival has never failed can you say
[1:24:24] amen amen he said all you have to do is
[1:24:26] recall the last move of God in the
[1:24:28] spirit when men and women dressed like
[1:24:29] Christians went to church prayed all
[1:24:30] night took the street corners and
[1:24:32] weren't ashamed of the manifestations of
[1:24:34] the spirit they left their old dead
[1:24:36] churches and worshiped in homes their
[1:24:37] old store buildings maybe a barn out
[1:24:39] here in the middle on a gravel road but
[1:24:42] what they did they would leave those big
[1:24:43] old listen you can go to a nice fancy
[1:24:45] Church in downtown whatever downtown you
[1:24:47] got around
[1:24:49] here we don't have none in Hardy that's
[1:24:51] very
[1:24:53] fancy but you could go to a big morg and
[1:24:56] worship and you could go down there and
[1:24:58] they might play the goodness of God
[1:24:59] better than you've ever heard it and
[1:25:01] they might sing they might out sing
[1:25:03] every one of the people in this building
[1:25:05] just on Talon alone probably not
[1:25:08] probably not mad
[1:25:09] anyway but they could go down there and
[1:25:11] they would have the best dressed choirs
[1:25:12] brother Ram talks about it the best
[1:25:14] dressed choirs the the matching robes
[1:25:16] and they could even get up there and
[1:25:18] raise their hands and no doubt you might
[1:25:20] feel an anointing in that
[1:25:23] church might
[1:25:25] on a good day you
[1:25:27] might but when you come here you may not
[1:25:30] listen you may be you may Worship in a
[1:25:32] barn you may get in a tent it's not
[1:25:34] about it's not about the place that
[1:25:36] you're worshiping in it's about the
[1:25:38] person that's sitting here because
[1:25:40] there's a Revival on the inside of you
[1:25:42] that they don't even know about well can
[1:25:44] you say Amen there's a Revival on the
[1:25:46] inside of you that if there was no other
[1:25:48] Church to go to and all you could do was
[1:25:50] Stand Down on the street corner and beat
[1:25:52] an old tambourine and witness about the
[1:25:53] message of the hour you would be found
[1:25:55] faithful doing that why because the
[1:25:57] message is on the inside of you and you
[1:26:00] can't hide the light of the hour
[1:26:02] somebody's going to somebody's going to
[1:26:04] shine this light to the world somebody's
[1:26:06] going to be a glow in a dark world and
[1:26:09] there's people out there I still believe
[1:26:11] there's people out here that are looking
[1:26:12] for light but we haven't found them yet
[1:26:15] but I believe when it's their time when
[1:26:16] they can accept the message of the hour
[1:26:18] the message will cross their path
[1:26:20] because God will not lose one of his so
[1:26:23] if you got children out there don't you
[1:26:25] worry about them claim them under the
[1:26:27] message of the hour if you've got a
[1:26:28] spouse out there claim them under the
[1:26:30] message of the hour if you've got family
[1:26:32] members out there that have not seen
[1:26:34] this message claim them under this
[1:26:36] message and say I'm not going to lose a
[1:26:38] one of them because I'm in the land of
[1:26:40] promise and everything is mine can you
[1:26:44] say Amen we're not looking for another
[1:26:46] Revival that will make our family come
[1:26:48] back the Revival's here and the family's
[1:26:51] coming
[1:26:51] in I'll tell you what I believe tonight
[1:26:53] brother M when you see family out there
[1:26:55] and they're drifting and you're like
[1:26:56] well Lord what's going on it don't
[1:26:58] listen just have faith for them believe
[1:27:00] for them because you've got a promise of
[1:27:01] your children I know they still have to
[1:27:03] come in I know they still have to accept
[1:27:05] this message but I have a I have a
[1:27:07] belief in my heart that there's
[1:27:08] something going to bring them in before
[1:27:10] the time of rapture I believe it's going
[1:27:12] to happen any day if the Rapture is
[1:27:14] scheduled to happen tomorrow then my
[1:27:16] lost relatives are somehow going to be
[1:27:18] ready tonight can you say Amen we're not
[1:27:22] looking for something else to get our
[1:27:24] family ready the message is here to get
[1:27:26] your family ready the message is here to
[1:27:29] call out those sleeping Saints the
[1:27:31] message is here the voice of the
[1:27:33] Resurrection is here all we have to do
[1:27:36] is participate in this bride's Revival
[1:27:39] just believe that whatever is in your
[1:27:42] heart believe that the reason that that
[1:27:44] you're sitting here tonight may be
[1:27:45] because your family needed you to have
[1:27:47] the faith for them when they just
[1:27:49] couldn't have faith for themselves
[1:27:50] somebody's got to be ready to fulfill
[1:27:53] the word of your hour and if brother
[1:27:54] Brandon would say that you just have to
[1:27:56] have the same faith for your salvation
[1:27:58] and have that same faith for your
[1:27:59] children then I just have to believe
[1:28:01] that there's a reason he would say that
[1:28:03] to build somebody's faith when their
[1:28:05] family just didn't look like they were
[1:28:06] ever going to come in listen I've seen
[1:28:08] men and you know some of them brother
[1:28:10] Matt some of us have standing here you
[1:28:12] you've seen men that have went out there
[1:28:14] and they've went into the world and
[1:28:15] they've done all kinds of unspeakable
[1:28:17] things but they're preaching the gospel
[1:28:19] tonight many of them are pastors of
[1:28:20] churches why because it was the message
[1:28:23] working in the hearts of the person even
[1:28:25] when they were out there on the bar
[1:28:27] stool even when they were out there
[1:28:29] listen I tell you what there's going to
[1:28:31] be a lot of people that they're going to
[1:28:32] be there that you didn't think would
[1:28:33] make it well come on somebody because
[1:28:36] all the time we're over here with our
[1:28:37] measuring sticks listen I believe in
[1:28:39] Holiness I sure do but I believe it's
[1:28:41] got to be something on the inside or you
[1:28:43] can have a whole bunch of people dressed
[1:28:45] like Holiness Christians that hadn't got
[1:28:46] an ounce of God in them but if there's
[1:28:48] something on the inside of you it'll
[1:28:51] change you and it'll make you to where
[1:28:53] nobody can talk talk you out of that
[1:28:55] nobody can talk you into it but
[1:28:57] something on the inside of you has a
[1:28:59] staying power can you say
[1:29:02] Amen about halfway through stay with me
[1:29:05] for just a few minutes brother Joe I
[1:29:07] tell you I know it's Wednesday night and
[1:29:08] I'm always I'm always scared I'm going
[1:29:09] to lose them when they get tired and
[1:29:11] well I I'm trying I'm trying let's just
[1:29:14] stay with her here just for a few
[1:29:15] minutes when the spiritual bride when
[1:29:16] she begins to have a Revival praise the
[1:29:18] Lord for that when she begins to have a
[1:29:20] Revival and begins to come back and line
[1:29:23] herself up with the word of God watch
[1:29:25] then again you see how that the
[1:29:26] scriptures at that time there will be a
[1:29:28] message sweep out to catch that bride
[1:29:30] catch that woman elect can you say amen
[1:29:33] he said for as the world Satan the
[1:29:35] deceiver who deceived the first bride to
[1:29:36] sinning against God by misbelieving his
[1:29:38] word and now today as we see the church
[1:29:40] natural in your intellectual gospel
[1:29:42] listen intellectual gospel is not going
[1:29:44] to save you it might make you think
[1:29:46] you're good for a while or maybe think
[1:29:48] you're saved for a while but there's got
[1:29:49] to be more than an intellectual gospel
[1:29:51] or that's never going to take you out of
[1:29:52] here but he said they're going going
[1:29:54] further and further away from the word
[1:29:55] in Social Gospel we find that the women
[1:29:57] of the world on the streets members and
[1:29:59] such is carrying themselves in the same
[1:30:00] atmosphere you can't tell them apart
[1:30:02] they've lost all sense of common decency
[1:30:05] the people have see and that's the way
[1:30:07] the church has and you can see it going
[1:30:09] straight to the ecumenical council just
[1:30:10] as certain as anything and right as into
[1:30:13] Rome as hard as it can go see because
[1:30:14] it's prophesied and there she is that's
[1:30:16] her behavior but then watch again the
[1:30:18] spiritual church how that that group of
[1:30:20] people called out the elected through
[1:30:22] every Revival now he names them off he
[1:30:24] says in the Lutheran Revival and the
[1:30:26] wesleyian Revival and the Pentecost
[1:30:28] first started they Dro them women right
[1:30:30] back in line with the word and then they
[1:30:32] drift away and there she goes right back
[1:30:34] over into the chaos but then the time
[1:30:36] come that the people are ready to line
[1:30:38] up I hope you hear this now there's a
[1:30:40] people ready to line up there is a
[1:30:41] message comes forth and they line with
[1:30:44] it I'm lining up with it not because I
[1:30:46] have to but because I want to not
[1:30:49] because the preacher told me that I
[1:30:51] wasn't dressing good but I heard of
[1:30:53] prophet voice and I come to the house of
[1:30:55] God and I'm lining up with the message I
[1:30:58] may not understand why but I know that
[1:31:00] I'm in this revival and I'm going to
[1:31:02] stay in this revival by lining up with
[1:31:04] the word of God I cannot fall
[1:31:07] away can't fall
[1:31:10] away can you say
[1:31:12] amen he said but then watch out he said
[1:31:15] that every Revival was that way he said
[1:31:16] that they called out the elector every
[1:31:18] Revival and he talks about them and then
[1:31:20] he said then the time the people are
[1:31:21] ready they line up with the message now
[1:31:22] he goes on down here
[1:31:24] and he says now friends go back with me
[1:31:26] there's the F where's the first Revival
[1:31:27] come a after death is when the days of
[1:31:29] the grain of wheat had fallen to the
[1:31:31] ground the body and the bride the bride
[1:31:32] of Christ he said where did it come from
[1:31:34] where was the first Revival Christ he
[1:31:36] said is that right his church he never
[1:31:37] organized it he just said Apostles and
[1:31:40] Prophets and so forth in the church to
[1:31:41] keep it clean but at ni sea of Rome 306
[1:31:44] years later they organized it and made
[1:31:46] an organization out of it is that right
[1:31:48] and it died now brother brandom talks
[1:31:51] about the the the death has always
[1:31:53] caused by a denomination are you still
[1:31:55] with me and he says everything he said
[1:31:58] that didn't agree with that church was
[1:31:59] put to death and it laid still for
[1:32:01] hundreds of years in the dirt but after
[1:32:03] a while up she come in Luther and the
[1:32:05] first little sprigs of corn come up the
[1:32:07] second it budded out from there and went
[1:32:09] into swingley and so forth and the other
[1:32:11] organizations and so forth and after a
[1:32:12] while he said Here Comes the Anglican
[1:32:14] church and here come Wesley and with a
[1:32:16] new Revival and he said it looks a
[1:32:18] little more like wheat and then what
[1:32:19] happened to that it organized and dried
[1:32:21] up and died and the life went right into
[1:32:23] a Chu and the shut come forth almost
[1:32:25] perfectly like the wheat but finally its
[1:32:27] Folly was made manifest can you say
[1:32:30] amen and he said in the last day in the
[1:32:33] last eight or 10 years especially in the
[1:32:35] last three years now what does it do
[1:32:37] pull away from the wheat now why hasn't
[1:32:39] there been an organization start up in
[1:32:40] these last 20 years of this great
[1:32:41] Revival it now we can go back and say 60
[1:32:44] plus years 70 years now this revival has
[1:32:46] not organized now he says why he says
[1:32:49] why is it not started up he said it's
[1:32:51] anointed prophets anointed teachers and
[1:32:52] so forth but why ain't it there there's
[1:32:54] nothing Beyond The Grain see it's back
[1:32:57] without an organization he said oh my
[1:32:59] blind man could see that it cannot
[1:33:01] organized can you say Amen it's so
[1:33:03] firmly against it it's the grain of
[1:33:05] wheat itself the son of man will be made
[1:33:07] manifest the grain of wheat will come
[1:33:09] back to itself again the son of man in
[1:33:11] the last days and there will come false
[1:33:13] impersonations of it in the last days
[1:33:15] it'll almost somebody say almost deceive
[1:33:18] the of very elected it's not possible
[1:33:20] aren't you thankful for that he said but
[1:33:22] it would almost he would be so close it
[1:33:23] would almost deceive him and he goes on
[1:33:25] down he said now notice the anointed
[1:33:27] prophets will be false and and and and
[1:33:29] there among it will be true anointed he
[1:33:31] said how you going to tell it by the
[1:33:33] word can you say Amen by the word like
[1:33:35] we have it in Shadow do you see it and
[1:33:37] he said the congregation says amen and
[1:33:39] he said now notice the anointed ones
[1:33:41] only the word will separate them not the
[1:33:44] signs well can you say Amen there'll be
[1:33:47] signs that listen there look back in in
[1:33:50] Pharaoh there when Moses was standing
[1:33:52] there as Janice and jambers and they
[1:33:53] could do almost everything Moses could
[1:33:55] do but listen there's got to be
[1:33:57] something there's got to be a word that
[1:33:58] came with the sign it's got to be more
[1:34:01] than just the sign but there's got to be
[1:34:02] a voice behind it there's got to be a
[1:34:04] word to wake up the people somebody had
[1:34:07] to call the people out of Egypt it had
[1:34:09] to be the word of a Vindicated Prophet
[1:34:11] not just people that could make God look
[1:34:13] good or say well look at our gods look
[1:34:15] what we can do no that's not what we're
[1:34:17] looking for we're not following the
[1:34:18] signs we're following the word and the
[1:34:21] signs will follow us
[1:34:24] can you say
[1:34:25] amen he said it's not the signs no
[1:34:27] they'll do the same signs but the words
[1:34:29] what separated them sure they all
[1:34:31] prophesied they all done this listen and
[1:34:33] I actually take comfort from this
[1:34:34] scripture because that doesn't mean we
[1:34:36] won't prophesy and they will we will
[1:34:39] too well can you say man if we're doing
[1:34:41] all the same thing then he didn't say
[1:34:43] we're going to be sitting there and the
[1:34:44] prophecy listen well come on somebody I
[1:34:46] don't believe everything that was
[1:34:48] restored to the church listen I believe
[1:34:49] in order I believe in church order but
[1:34:51] everything that was restored to the
[1:34:52] church is is still
[1:34:55] here we didn't have to do away with it
[1:34:57] but our Focus has turned to the word can
[1:35:00] you say Amen so we don't Focus maybe on
[1:35:02] a uh listen somebody standing up and and
[1:35:04] speaking in tongues although I believe
[1:35:06] in the tongues but listen you know
[1:35:07] that's not the preeminence there's a
[1:35:08] reason why there's a reason why that the
[1:35:11] spirit of the Prophet is subject to the
[1:35:12] prophets why because when a preacher
[1:35:14] standing in the Pulpit that that's not
[1:35:15] because the preacher has the preeminence
[1:35:17] but the word which is Christ has the
[1:35:19] preeminence it's not me that stands up
[1:35:21] here and says well because I'm standing
[1:35:23] here every every body else is no that's
[1:35:24] not it at all brother Matt don't stand
[1:35:26] up here as a dictator and say well if
[1:35:27] I'm up here yall sit down and be quiet
[1:35:29] no sir but he believes in order because
[1:35:31] a prophet taught the order in the church
[1:35:32] so what he's telling you is this I
[1:35:34] believe everything a prophet said and if
[1:35:36] it's in order then it's lined up with
[1:35:38] the word then God can use
[1:35:40] it I hope that's okay I know I'm not at
[1:35:43] home but sometimes I feel like I am if
[1:35:44] that's okay y'all just make me feel
[1:35:47] comfortable and I appreciate it I really
[1:35:48] really do and I won't abuse that tonight
[1:35:51] with a long sermon but but he
[1:35:54] you're like it's already too late
[1:35:56] but Jesus said they'll do the same
[1:35:58] things but the word is what separated
[1:36:00] them now Mark 16 I want you we all know
[1:36:03] this Mark 16 uh Mark 16:15 and he said
[1:36:06] to them go you on all the world and
[1:36:07] preach the gospel to Every Creature
[1:36:08] that's a commission can you say amen and
[1:36:10] he that believeth and is baptized shall
[1:36:13] be saved can you say Amen but he that
[1:36:15] believeth not shall be damned and these
[1:36:18] signs shall follow them that believe in
[1:36:20] my name they shall cast out Devils they
[1:36:22] shall speak with new tongues they shall
[1:36:23] take up serpents and if they drink any
[1:36:25] deadly thing it will not hurt them they
[1:36:27] shall lay hands on the sick and they
[1:36:28] shall recover we all know that to be
[1:36:29] true but remember the signs are
[1:36:31] following the believer so we are
[1:36:33] following the word and if we're
[1:36:35] following the word the signs will be
[1:36:37] there when we need the signs healing is
[1:36:39] there for you when you need your healing
[1:36:41] Revival's here when you need Revival but
[1:36:44] what you got to do is follow the word
[1:36:46] don't follow the next great move but
[1:36:47] follow the move that is on for the bride
[1:36:50] it is the word
[1:36:52] Revival that is the move that's on for
[1:36:54] the bride brother Brandon would say it
[1:36:55] here I've got the quote I'll get to it
[1:36:58] shortly he said It reminds me of a story
[1:37:00] I love this quote brother Joe this is
[1:37:01] one of not one of my favorites because
[1:37:03] I've told you that a couple times
[1:37:04] tonight probably already but he said he
[1:37:06] was talking about the great Welsh
[1:37:07] Revival and I love this because he's
[1:37:09] talking about this he said they were
[1:37:11] they were going out through the nation
[1:37:12] the Welsh Revival he said what would be
[1:37:13] taking place they went over to find
[1:37:15] these people went over to find out and
[1:37:16] they seen this building it was to see
[1:37:18] the building that was being held in when
[1:37:19] they got to Wales they went around and
[1:37:20] began to ask about where the building
[1:37:22] was and they seen a happy little officer
[1:37:24] standing on the corner with his little
[1:37:26] Tommy hat on I just want to emphasize
[1:37:28] the word happy this man had been in
[1:37:30] Revival and he was happy this man was
[1:37:33] even on the job and he was happy he was
[1:37:36] at work and he was happy that's a real
[1:37:39] revival can you
[1:37:41] say I tell you what sometimes it's hard
[1:37:43] to be happy at work but this man had
[1:37:46] been in such a great Revival that he's
[1:37:48] standing there and and he's swinging his
[1:37:50] Club around and around like that and
[1:37:51] these men walk up to him and said sir
[1:37:53] could you tell me what building the
[1:37:54] Welsh Revival is held in he said sir I'm
[1:37:57] it oh come on somebody you say where's
[1:38:00] this bride Revival happening you're
[1:38:02] looking at it where is this bride
[1:38:04] Revival happening it's not just in Black
[1:38:06] Rock Arkansas it's not just in Hardy
[1:38:08] Arkansas but it's wherever the Bride of
[1:38:10] Jesus Christan you are the bride's
[1:38:12] Revival the bride is feasting on the
[1:38:15] word of God for this day we've grown up
[1:38:17] like calvs in the stone we've ate on the
[1:38:19] Mana from heaven we are she we have
[1:38:22] become the very body of Jesus Christ
[1:38:24] we're more than able to take our
[1:38:26] promises today we're more than able to
[1:38:29] call those things just like the first
[1:38:31] Adam did why because we have been
[1:38:32] restored back not just to 1906 but all
[1:38:35] the way back to where this first Eve
[1:38:37] would be restored again and she will not
[1:38:40] fall the second Eve will not fall why
[1:38:42] because the first Eve God saw it and he
[1:38:45] knew that there would be death that
[1:38:46] would come a Revival would come and
[1:38:48] death would come look like a garden of
[1:38:50] En look like a perfect Revival but that
[1:38:52] Revival had to Die Why why because of a
[1:38:54] a misbelieving one word but then when
[1:38:56] this second Eve would come she says Lord
[1:38:58] whatever you have for me whatever words
[1:39:00] you have spoken over my family whatever
[1:39:02] word you're going to speak to me I
[1:39:04] believe it and I stand on it nothing can
[1:39:07] take me out of this bride nothing can
[1:39:09] stop me from believing the word of this
[1:39:12] day why because I didn't go looking for
[1:39:14] the message the message found
[1:39:17] me I didn't go looking when I was a
[1:39:19] teenager I was raised in some pretty
[1:39:21] crazy stuff not to be too open about
[1:39:23] about it but there was some pretty crazy
[1:39:24] stuff in our household there was some
[1:39:26] pretty crazy doctrines went on we didn't
[1:39:27] believe in a rapture we didn't believe
[1:39:28] in any of these things and I'm just
[1:39:30] going to go ahead and tell you like this
[1:39:31] when I when I got out of that I thought
[1:39:33] I was in a mess I went out looking for
[1:39:35] another group I thought there's got to
[1:39:36] be something more for me and I went and
[1:39:38] I went to a United Pentecostal Church as
[1:39:39] a teenage boy and I sat in there and
[1:39:42] they preached on the evidence the
[1:39:43] initial evidence of the Holy Ghost being
[1:39:44] speaking in tongues I had heard too much
[1:39:46] word to sit there I had already heard a
[1:39:50] prophet say that it was not the initial
[1:39:52] evidence of the Holy Ghost and he backed
[1:39:54] it up with scripture and I'm sitting
[1:39:55] there thinking what am I doing here when
[1:39:57] I've got the message of the hour when
[1:39:59] it's literally telling me that what
[1:40:01] they're preaching is false and he backed
[1:40:03] it up with the Bible why would I leave
[1:40:05] the word to come into this chicken pin
[1:40:07] well come on somebody just because it
[1:40:10] looks good just because they got bigger
[1:40:12] churches and they got better dressed
[1:40:13] members and more money in the
[1:40:15] headquarters let me goe and tell you
[1:40:17] something this bride it don't matter how
[1:40:19] poor she gets it don't matter how small
[1:40:22] she gets she is an invincible Army she
[1:40:25] is raised up by the word of God and she
[1:40:28] will not
[1:40:30] fall so you might as well just quit
[1:40:32] trying to put her out quit trying to put
[1:40:34] the flame out quit trying to say we
[1:40:35] ain't got no more Revival oh stop with
[1:40:38] that nonsense and say I am the Revival I
[1:40:41] am what God has promised for this day
[1:40:43] brother the Joe he raised you for a Time
[1:40:46] such as this because every trial you go
[1:40:48] through he knew you could handle it for
[1:40:51] the matter everything the reason put you
[1:40:53] here was not because maybe you say well
[1:40:55] I wasn't the most qualified let me go
[1:40:57] and tell you something he needed a man
[1:40:58] who was going to stand for the word no
[1:41:00] matter what anybody else would say about
[1:41:01] him he needed a church that would say I
[1:41:03] don't care if there's two or three of us
[1:41:06] here we're going to stand as a mighty
[1:41:08] Invincible Army I don't care what the
[1:41:10] world calls us I don't care what the
[1:41:12] other churches call us I don't care what
[1:41:14] the so-called message call me I am the
[1:41:16] Bride of Jesus Christ somebody might as
[1:41:19] well go ahead and just take their stand
[1:41:21] and say I am she
[1:41:24] I am an invisible Army I am the prde of
[1:41:27] Christ nothing can take me out you
[1:41:29] didn't put me in it you can't take me
[1:41:32] out of it he saw me before the
[1:41:34] foundation of the world well I'm not
[1:41:36] saying that to brag it's all about him
[1:41:38] he's the one that did it it's all about
[1:41:41] the blood it's all about his power his
[1:41:43] power raised me to where I am his power
[1:41:46] is going to raise me up on that
[1:41:48] Resurrection morning his power is going
[1:41:50] to take us in a Rapture I'm not looking
[1:41:52] for another Jesus I'm not looking for
[1:41:54] another word Prophet it's already came
[1:41:56] and it called out a bride you are the
[1:41:59] living body of Jesus Christ today what
[1:42:01] he did you're going to do what he said
[1:42:04] you're going to say the way he said to
[1:42:07] live is how you're going to line up to
[1:42:08] it why because this is a word Revival
[1:42:12] don't you tell me that it's okay to be
[1:42:14] dead and quiet in church because I'm
[1:42:16] going to goad and tell you something if
[1:42:18] the word has come into you you will be
[1:42:20] stimulated by the Revelation that has
[1:42:22] come in your day I'm not talking about a
[1:42:24] workup I'm talking about a word that
[1:42:26] will affect the people I'm talking about
[1:42:28] the word that will move on the hearts of
[1:42:30] the people a word will call you from the
[1:42:33] dead sins and trespasses and it will
[1:42:35] bring you into the Glorious L of the
[1:42:36] message of the hour this word still
[1:42:39] works can you say Amen this is the word
[1:42:42] that's alive all other words that are
[1:42:44] denominated are dead cold religions but
[1:42:46] this word this word Works can you say
[1:42:49] amen I tell you I just I just feel it on
[1:42:52] my heart tonight to say if you're
[1:42:53] doubting this message listen don't you
[1:42:55] go look at them stupid YouTube videos
[1:42:56] and things that are trying to say that
[1:42:58] the message is false go ask them where
[1:43:00] their life is at come they ain't got no
[1:43:02] life in it but they're they look over
[1:43:04] here and it's the same people in the
[1:43:05] days of Jesus would crucify him because
[1:43:08] how he didn't vindicate the scriptures
[1:43:09] when he Vindicated them to a te and
[1:43:11] today you'll see our Prophet that has
[1:43:14] come and Vindicated his message around
[1:43:16] the world seven times and you'll see not
[1:43:18] one time that the Vindication would fail
[1:43:21] and yet you'll have the naysayers and
[1:43:22] you'll have the people that say well
[1:43:24] Moses you're You're Nobody you can't
[1:43:26] take the people over and you'll have
[1:43:28] people say well Joshua the Giants are
[1:43:29] too big for us we got all kinds of
[1:43:31] people saying the message won't work but
[1:43:34] I say it will
[1:43:36] work this message is good enough for me
[1:43:39] it's good enough for you it's good
[1:43:40] enough to call you from the grave it's
[1:43:43] good enough to raise up the dead in your
[1:43:44] life it's good enough to make a living
[1:43:47] church here in Black Rock Arkansas
[1:43:49] brother Joe it's good enough to keep us
[1:43:51] from the world again it's big enough for
[1:43:54] me why because it's not a messenger it's
[1:43:57] the word that came and that is Christ
[1:43:59] that is coming to the heart of the
[1:44:00] believer we have been made one with him
[1:44:03] can you say Amen well I tell you I just
[1:44:06] I'm about out of time but can I just go
[1:44:07] a little farther is that okay just a few
[1:44:09] minutes I just want to drive this home
[1:44:11] that you are a part of that bride now
[1:44:13] brother Brandon would say here and I
[1:44:14] just want to get to this he said the
[1:44:15] move is on for the bride some of you
[1:44:17] people that really believe that this is
[1:44:19] to be the truth that we're entering
[1:44:20] another age we're entering into the
[1:44:21] raptured age oh I love is he said you
[1:44:24] know the church can't go in its
[1:44:25] condition and it can't get any better so
[1:44:27] if you're looking for the churches out
[1:44:28] there to get better and ready for a
[1:44:29] Rapture you're looking at the wrong
[1:44:31] place on but what we're looking for is
[1:44:35] not the church but the bride and so he
[1:44:38] said now we're entering the rap the
[1:44:40] church can't go on this condition how
[1:44:41] many knows that he says amen he said
[1:44:43] it's got to get worse and it can't go
[1:44:44] like this see it's got to be something
[1:44:46] and it's moving right now can you say
[1:44:49] amen he said friend it's on the move is
[1:44:52] on for to the bride and I love this he
[1:44:54] said that's thus sayith the Lord
[1:44:57] somebody ought to say Amen to that thus
[1:44:59] sayith the Lord the move is on for the
[1:45:01] rde that was in 1965 one of the last
[1:45:04] messages he would preach listen why
[1:45:06] would he say that because he didn't want
[1:45:08] you the people he came to to call out of
[1:45:10] those denominations to be in the same
[1:45:13] cycle of death as the other churches
[1:45:15] were he wanted you to recognize the
[1:45:17] Awakening of the bride and realize this
[1:45:19] is your age this is bride time this is
[1:45:23] time to go ahead and Shout over
[1:45:24] Revelation this is time to shout about
[1:45:26] more than just a gift but it's time to
[1:45:28] go ahead and Shout about the giver
[1:45:30] himself coming down and calling you from
[1:45:33] the dead sin and trespasses and making
[1:45:35] you into this glorious gospel listen
[1:45:37] there is a bride and there's a body of
[1:45:39] Jesus Christ on this Earth and you are
[1:45:42] that
[1:45:43] body you say well where's the literal
[1:45:45] Corporal body at brother Ram said he's
[1:45:47] coming and Believers believe that that's
[1:45:48] exactly what he said he said Believers
[1:45:50] believe that but listen he had to he
[1:45:52] never would leave the Earth without a
[1:45:53] witness so he had to have someone here
[1:45:56] that would make up the Earthly body of
[1:45:58] Jesus Christ you are she can you say
[1:46:02] Amen brother brandom says it like this
[1:46:05] and I'm going to close on this
[1:46:07] one he said God and I want you to just
[1:46:10] if this if any of this applies to you I
[1:46:11] want you to put your hand up in the air
[1:46:13] God created me a
[1:46:15] Revival let me be the Revival Let each
[1:46:19] one of us be the Revival the Revival in
[1:46:22] me make me Lord to hunger make me to
[1:46:25] thirst created me Lord that what is
[1:46:28] needed in me let me from this hour on be
[1:46:30] thine more consecrated servant a better
[1:46:33] servant more blessed of you more able
[1:46:35] more humble more kind more willing to
[1:46:37] work more looking to the things that are
[1:46:39] positive and forgetting the things that
[1:46:41] are in the past and the negatives let me
[1:46:43] press towards the mark of the High
[1:46:44] Calling of Christ I say that's my prayer
[1:46:46] tonight church let me quit looking to
[1:46:48] what I was let I wish somebody just
[1:46:50] stand their feet and say praise the Lord
[1:46:52] right now if you have been called from
[1:46:54] the world and its condition This Is Your
[1:46:56] Night to stand up and say I am the Bride
[1:46:59] of Jesus Christ I'm not going to go down
[1:47:01] with the Flames of the world but I'm
[1:47:03] going to be caught up in that meeting in
[1:47:05] the air I am the bride body on the earth
[1:47:08] now we don't have to look around and say
[1:47:10] there's something else coming to call me
[1:47:11] up no The Voice has already come the
[1:47:13] voice of the Resurrection is in you the
[1:47:15] word is in you you have become the word
[1:47:18] just like Eve was a part of Adam you are
[1:47:21] a part of the second Adam and and you
[1:47:23] cannot fall somebody say I can't fall
[1:47:26] I'll go ahead and tell the devil I can't
[1:47:29] fall musicians go ahead and
[1:47:32] come you don't have to worry about
[1:47:34] anything because the word already
[1:47:37] said I can't fall I may make mistakes
[1:47:41] and you can point to every one of my
[1:47:42] mistakes and I can go ahead and point
[1:47:43] you to a promise that I can't fall away
[1:47:47] you can say well brother Joel you've
[1:47:48] done this I tell you what I wouldn't
[1:47:50] want my whole life to be put up on a
[1:47:52] screen in front of a church neither
[1:47:53] would
[1:47:54] you neither would
[1:47:56] you but after the blood covered if you
[1:47:58] could look through his eyes it'd be a
[1:48:00] blank slate nothing left what sins are
[1:48:03] you talking about amen he don't even
[1:48:05] remember them no more he don't even have
[1:48:07] a name for him now why because he can't
[1:48:09] even find them no more what sins are we
[1:48:11] talking about what sins can you bring up
[1:48:13] listen the sins are under the blood this
[1:48:16] bride has been washed this BL this bride
[1:48:19] has been cleansed this bride is ready
[1:48:22] for for a Rapture you say there's still
[1:48:25] problems yeah humanity is still here
[1:48:28] you're still in a human flesh but that
[1:48:30] body ain't going in a
[1:48:31] Rapture the body ain't
[1:48:34] going I hope you're hearing me tonight I
[1:48:37] know we got to live right act right do
[1:48:39] right we do that because we love the
[1:48:40] Lord but that body is not converted
[1:48:44] brother brandom says that he teaches us
[1:48:45] the body the flesh part is not
[1:48:48] converted and why does the devil fight
[1:48:50] your mind because that mind will set
[1:48:53] there and every evil thought that can
[1:48:55] come on a man's mind will come on your
[1:48:56] mind every evil thing that can come into
[1:48:59] a man's mind that's where the that's the
[1:49:00] Devil's Ground that's where he fights
[1:49:02] you and you only keep that under
[1:49:04] subjection by the word but there's
[1:49:07] something on the inside of the Bride
[1:49:09] that is much more than just a mental
[1:49:11] conception of an idea that a message
[1:49:13] came there's something on the inside of
[1:49:15] the Bride that is more than just another
[1:49:17] good time in a Pentecostal church but
[1:49:20] there's something way down deep in the
[1:49:22] soul of a man or a woman and they they
[1:49:25] can't even help themselves because
[1:49:28] inside of them they believe even when
[1:49:30] their mind tells them to doubt can you
[1:49:32] say Amen when you felt like giving up
[1:49:36] something held on to you when you felt
[1:49:38] like backsliding something wouldn't let
[1:49:40] you go out when you felt like you had to
[1:49:43] give up because you just couldn't take
[1:49:45] another step something was holding you
[1:49:47] can you say amen and I say it's nothing
[1:49:50] less than God himself in the heart of
[1:49:52] the Believers that is holding you until
[1:49:55] your day of redemption can you say Amen
[1:49:57] if you believe that you're part of his
[1:50:00] bride tonight don't you let the devil
[1:50:02] come tomorrow and tell you well am I am
[1:50:04] I really yes you
[1:50:06] are the fact that you're here brother
[1:50:08] brand talks about footsteps meaning
[1:50:10] possession I know I'm over time about
[1:50:11] about 5 minutes
[1:50:13] over but
[1:50:15] listen the word of God has come in such
[1:50:18] a way in such a powerful way in this age
[1:50:21] that it didn't come to low you to sleep
[1:50:23] like the lead of sins but it come to
[1:50:25] wake you up and when you find yourself
[1:50:28] start getting a little cold on God I say
[1:50:31] come back to the house of God again when
[1:50:34] you don't feel like going to church
[1:50:35] that's the time you need to be in church
[1:50:37] when you don't feel like worshiping
[1:50:39] Praise Him Anyway when the chains that
[1:50:42] seem to bind you are holding on to you
[1:50:44] praise your way out of those chains go
[1:50:47] ahead and say God has put me here for
[1:50:49] such a time as this I'm an overcomer I I
[1:50:52] am called to be the Bride of Jesus
[1:50:55] Christ nothing can stop this move of God
[1:50:57] because thus sayith the Lord the move is
[1:51:00] on for the bride the bride's Revival is
[1:51:03] here we're awake now we see the
[1:51:06] Mysteries but we don't listen we may not
[1:51:08] understand every mistreat but they've
[1:51:09] been open to us everything you have need
[1:51:11] of has been open to you can you say Amen
[1:51:15] with your heads bowed if there's a need
[1:51:17] on your heart tonight we'd be happy to
[1:51:18] pray with
[1:51:19] you if you got something on your heart
[1:51:21] you can even slip your hand up to the
[1:51:23] Lord say Lord I know who I am but the
[1:51:26] devil's fought me hard this week you
[1:51:29] know I'd like to just give you some
[1:51:31] comfort and saying the devil the devil
[1:51:33] knows he's just a
[1:51:34] bluff but he don't know that you know
[1:51:36] that yet so sometimes we got to remind
[1:51:39] the devil Satan you're just a bluff
[1:51:42] Satan you're just a
[1:51:44] scarecrow you can't come after me you
[1:51:47] can't come against this move of God
[1:51:49] because this move of God that I'm a part
[1:51:51] of and I'm participating in cannot be
[1:51:53] stopped can you say Amen with your heads
[1:51:56] bowed and your eyes closed like I said
[1:51:58] if you have a need we're happy to pray
[1:52:00] with you but just pour your heart out to
[1:52:02] the Lord right there if you listen if
[1:52:03] you feel bound tonight just worship your
[1:52:06] way out of that bondage if you feel that
[1:52:08] the devil is trying to hold you back
[1:52:10] from participating in the bride's
[1:52:11] Revival just go ahead and throw them
[1:52:13] hands up and say devil you ain't got no
[1:52:15] hold on this bride go ahead and tell
[1:52:17] that devil Satan you're a liar and you
[1:52:19] can't stand here why because that
[1:52:21] commission to cast cast out Devils is
[1:52:23] going to follow the believer and if
[1:52:25] you're a Believer here tonight you have
[1:52:27] the authority to tell that devil to go
[1:52:30] back to hell where he came from he has
[1:52:32] no hold on this bride the death cycle
[1:52:35] has been broken we're a living bride
[1:52:37] with a living
[1:52:39] Revival heavenly father as you see these
[1:52:42] people here

[1:52:54] power that you have given in this age to

[1:53:00] Vindicated prophet of this day I
[1:53:02] pronounce the Devils to flee from this
[1:53:04] building tonight I call for Satan to
[1:53:06] leave the minds of the people right now
[1:53:08] that they can worship God freely in the
[1:53:10] house of God I call Lord for families to
[1:53:12] be restored here tonight not by
[1:53:14] something I would say not by a man's
