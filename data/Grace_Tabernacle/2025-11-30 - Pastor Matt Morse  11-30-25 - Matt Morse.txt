We're serving a powerful living God that's present right here with us. Amen. We're more than conquerors through Christ Jesus. Amen. That pay the debt that we owed. Ain't you thankful for it this morning? Amen. Well, God bless you. We got a prayer [music] request this morning. And I know there's probably many needs among us. So we'll remember that this morning too. Says prayer request for Steven Allen. We just want to remember him this morning. And also McKenzie called this morning my [music] niece and said just continue to pray for my sister April and she's still in the hospital [music] seeing some kinds of improvement but just praying that the Lord will give her strength and lift her up as well. My grandson Ralphie Jesse's at home sick this [music] morning. So, let's just remember him and the family. Just so a lot of sickness. There's a lot of people gone this morning. Just just seemed like the sickness is hitting families. I know it's good to have [music] kind of Tim back. I know they've been gone few services with sickness. And it's good to have my [music] buddy, brother David back there this morning. It's good to see him and Lord touching [music] him. He says he's maybe not ready to run a race this morning, but I say he is. Greater is he that's in him [music] than he that's in the world. I mean, you believe it or you don't. How many believers we have in the house this morning? Well, God bless you. Just lift your hands if you got a need upon your heart. And [music] remember our pastor, he's been laboring and excited back there to bring the word of life to us. And I hope [music] we come with that same excitement this morning cuz I know one thing, if you're expecting something from God, God's going to meet that expectation this morning. That's the kind of God we serve. Let's just pray in our own way. Lord Jesus, [music] we thank you, Lord, for this opportunity that you've given us, Lord, to worship you in this tabernacle this morning, Lord God, as our precious brother begin to lead us in songs, [music] Lord. We felt your presence drop down among us, Lord. Lord, prepare in our hearts for the coming seed, Lord God, that's going to come forth, the word of the bread of life, Lord God. I pray, Lord God, that we glean as Ruth did behind the reapers, Lord God, this morning. Glean with everything in us, Lord, because we're in a journey. We're we're in a battle, Lord. We know the war has already been won, but we're right in the midst of a battle, Lord God. The hands out stretch that day at Calvary [music] is letting us know no matter what is going on around us, whatever circumstances we may be facing in life does not dictate if we're winning or losing. Lord, we look back to that day at Calvary. What Brother R said their hands was outstretched and they nailed them up to let us know, Lord, we're on the winning side. We're not defeated. We're more than conquerors. Lord God, we rallied around that word this morning. Lord, many sick and bod, Lord God. Lord, that my sister still in the hospital. We pray for her and McKenzie and the family, Lord. We pray, Lord God, for Stephen Allen this morning, Lord, my grandson, Robbie Jesse, Lord, we pray, Lord God, that you'd touch his body this morning. Many hands went up this morning in this tabernacle, Lord God. Lord, I know we battle, Lord God. There's a there's a great war that's going on. The raging of of hell against the be against the bride of Jesus Christ. Oh, but Lord, we're not going to listen to a backsliding prophet. Lord, Lord, we have spiritual food in due season. When Jonathan went down to the battle and the battle was raging, oh, he was told by the adversaries and not to eat, but Lord, there was spiritual honey in due season. He took his rod, he dipped it down into the honey, and he drew strength for the journey and the battle. Lord, we're in a great battle this morning. Lord, let us take our rods this morning and dip it down to into your anointing, honey, but be predestinated for such a time as this, Lord, and let us draw strength for the journey this morning. We pray, Lord, that you come in a special way. Anoint our pastor. He brings the word of life to us in Jesus Christ's name. And the bride says, "Oh, don't you love him?" Can you give the Lord a hand clap of praise this morning? Sing I bless your name in prison chains [singing] with bleeding [singing and music] stripes. Oh, Paul in silence. They pray that [singing] night in their pain. Oh, they begin to sing. [music] Oh, listen now. and they were free. Oh, I bless your name. Is [music] that why you come this morning? As we get ready for the pastor to come, don't you just slip your hands to him and sing this song unto the Lord this morning? Oh, he's still coming down and inhabiting [singing] your praise and worship this morning. Oh, I give you [singing] praise. [music] You are the life, the truth, the way. [music] I bless your name. &gt;&gt; [singing] &gt;&gt; Oh, submit that hour to make that hour. If you should find you're in a prison, not in your soul, but in your mind. [music] Oh, reach and pray. Yes, Lord. Oh, divide those [music] sh And they will fall in Jesus name all praise him like you love him this morning. I bless your name. [music] I bless your name. Oh, I give you honor.

[singing] Oh yes. If you should find, [singing] you're in a prison. [music] Oh, in [singing] your mind. Oh yes. Oh, reach out and praise. Hallelujah. defy those chains and they will [singing] fall in Jesus name. Oh, I bless your name. [singing] I bless your [music] name. name. Lord, I [music and singing] give you honor. Yes, I give you praise. For you [singing and music] are the life, the truth, the way. [music] &gt;&gt; [singing] &gt;&gt; I bless your [music] name. Yes, my Lord. I bless your [singing] name. Oh, I [singing] bless your name. My Lord, I bless your name. [singing and music] How many can do that from your heart this morning? Say, "Lord, I'm I'm not worthy, but you're worthy. And I just come to give you glory this morning, to be thankful for all that you've done for me. Lord, you've never failed me, never forsake me. Lord, I just want to come to worship you and give my all to you, Lord, to make you welcome in this place this [music] morning. You are my life, the truth. &gt;&gt; You're the way. I bless your name. Yes, my [singing and music] Lord. I bless your name. Won't you give the Lord a hand clap of praise this morning? For you're worthy of it all, [singing] isn't he though? You're worthy of it all. For [singing] from you are all things. To you are all things and you deserve the glory. [singing] &gt;&gt; You're worthy of it all. [music] [singing] Yes, you're worthy [music] of it all. From [singing and music] you are all things. To you are all things and you deserve the glory. [singing and music] Amen. Isn't he worthy this morning? How many love the Lord this morning? Amen. Has he been good to you? Amen. How many has something to thank God for? Amen. We [music] just look around the building and so thankful for all that God has done for us. Amen. just had a wonderful time. Hope you enjoyed the uh holidays and Thanksgiving holiday [music] and Amen. just to take the time to reflect on all that God has done for us. And you know, there's some some things I want to ask when I get over on the other side, you know, and you know, one of them is why do I feel so bad after Thanksgiving, such a good holiday, and I felt so bad the next day. And no, it was certainly had a a wonderful time with family and friends. I know many are still traveling in different places. So, just want to pray uh that God would be with them and and we're certainly thankful of all that God does for us. Amen. And and I believe that's what that holiday is about. And uh you know that we even have a place if you ever been done many missionary trips. You'll go to many places that you don't have the freedom uh to worship as we do or to raise a family, have the opportunity to go and and to work the way you do and provide for your family and and as sad as it sounds, not to make a sad note, but even the opportunity to have a house to live in or a roof over your children's head. And you know, I've been in areas where [music] people that are just as valuable as you are and no difference in the value of a human being, one of another, but by the thousands live on the streets that don't even have a roof to put over their head. And I thought, isn't it something that that that [music] u when in that kind of a place that they value different things, what's important to them is different uh than what's important to to some other people. And I thought, you know, uh I pray that our that what is [music] valuable to us, uh is not our possessions or not things that we can buy with money, uh but it's the it's the [music] life that we can have with Jesus Christ. Amen. And and so I just thank God for that this morning and all that he's done for us and to us and give to us. And we're certainly not worthy, but uh but we certainly are thankful. We never want to be ungrateful for what God does for us. So, we just love the Lord this morning. May you just bow our heads just a moment before we open the word. And you know, if you have something special on your heart you'd like the Lord to do uh this morning or maybe you just need uh some direction, I believe that God is certainly more than able. And so, won't we just call upon him and ask him to come and have his way. This is our service uh back. We just want to open the door and allow the atmosphere of the Holy Ghost uh to come through this room and and to reside here. So, let's just pray this morning. and gracious heavenly father, Lord, how privileged that we are, Lord, to stand in your presence this morning, Lord, know in the weakness of our our flesh, Lord, and but God, here we stand, Lord, as a needy people, Lord, we come before thy throne of mercy and grace. And Lord, knowing that there are many things, Lord, that we have need of, Lord, there's many hands that's raised this morning. And God, we just ask you, Lord, that you would have your way in this service. Lord, I pray [music] that the something that would be said, Lord, that would be edifying to the body of Christ. Lord, we just ask that you would help us to get out of the way, Lord, the hearer and the speaker this morning, Lord, that you would come and speak to your children, God. May we not hinder a move of God, Lord. May there not be anything in our life, Lord, that would hinder you. But God, make we just surrender to you once again, Lord. Allow you to have liberty, Lord. We pray you'd forgive us of our sins and failures and mistakes of this flesh, Lord. and we just allow you to to come and move in a special way. Lord, we pray you'd anoint this word and bring it to life. We ask in Jesus name we pray. Amen. Amen. We just want to invite you to the scripture to the Hebrews the 11th chapter. And I'm going to read one uh portion of scripture. Hebrews the 11th chapter uh in the first verse. Now uh this uh chapter is of course we know to be the the heroes of faith. many of us have spoke on it or preached out of it. And so it's always speaking of the faith that is among the believers all the way, you know, Paul took the believers all the way from uh the beginning of Israel uh all the way down to to those that were uh that were stoned and saw us under and you know talked about their great faith. And uh but I like how Paul begins this scripture. He says, "Now faith is the substance of things hoped for." So immediately he brings it and makes it a reality. He said, "It's the substance of things hoped for, the evidence of things not seen. For by it the elders obtained a good report. Through faith we understand that the worlds," somebody say worlds, the worlds were framed by the word of God, so that things which are seen were not made of things which do appear. And we'll just ask the Lord to add his blessing to the reading of the word. And as you take your seats this morning, I would like to speak on a dimensional victory. A dimensional victory. You know, I was thinking about our natural existence. And you realize that we live uh within the boundaries of this natural world. And we uh the boundaries of this flesh and what this natural world offers and uh what was created in the natural. And you know, the Bible is filled with scriptures. We won't read them this morning, but filled with scriptures that speak of this natural man and the challenges that we face uh in this in this natural body and how that uh whether they be internal or external challenges, there's challenges that we face. It could be uh the emotional challenge or frustration or pressures or heartaches or griefs. And all of these things are internal challenges that every man or every woman that's ever born of a man or born of a woman that that she uh uh that that they they face those same things. But also, not only do we face internal challenges, but external all uh that we have challenges. We're challenged by sickness and disease and uh uh pains in our flesh, things that you can feel. And uh so there there there's internal and there's physical challenges that we have. But the Bible Bible also tells us that uh this natural man or this natural world is affected by another world or an unseen world. And see this unseen world, it's a spiritual world. We're made up of uh we're a triune being. We're made up of body, soul, and spirit. And and so we realize that this natural body is in contact with natural things, but our but the spiritual man is what contacts spiritual things. And so, uh God has given us the ability to interact with another world. And you know, uh that that spiritual world, not all things are good. Not just because you talk about a spiritual world don't mean it's all good or or all spirits are good or that that that this unseen world that everything's good. Uh uh it's certainly filled with evil spirits and darkness and demonic spirits and uh but you know when you think about God whenever he created man when God created man he made a man in order to live. The Bible says from the very moment that God breathed life into the first man that he created and he formed out of the dust of the ground. The Bible says man became a living soul. And so uh from that time it showed us that man was meant to live. That's why the soul of a man thirsts for life. That's why he sows for or he thirsts for eternal life because man was created by God to be a living soul. And so we thirst for life. We long to be alive. The most precious thing we have is life. That's why grief is such a painful thing is because it it seems to be the absence of life in this carnal world or this natural world. And so uh we long to be alive. And ever every ever since that God has ever made a man to live, Satan has done everything he can to satisfy that hunger with something else. See, we thirsting for life and we're we're thirsting for that eternal life. We're thirsting for living. And so, Satan has done everything to satisfy it with other things. But says, see how Satan, he tries to pervert this satisfying of the soul or that thirst for the soul. He tries to give you everything to satisfy it. And so, he's so deceitful in these days of perversion. This is a perverted world. It's a perverted race. It's a perverted people. Everything is perverted. And he has perverted so gradual until it's become the most deceitful age that any human being has ever lived in. It's more deceitful than it ever was. How many can you say amen? This is the most deceitful age that has ever been. It's the most deceitful age that any man has ever lived in. And in this deceiving age, the thirst of a man's soul has been quenched with things of the world. It's been quenched with things from the outside or quenched with things of the natural world. That's why there's such a draw in the natural world because Satan is trying to quench that thirst for life or quench that thirst for for that other world or that other realm with things of this natural life. And so, because it's became so quenched, now man's search for God or eternal life has been put off. It's been put as a back burner. It's it's something that that quench has been stayed by things of the world. That's why Isaiah would talk about this world in this age. He said, "Darkness shall cover the earth and gross darkness the people." He said, "But the Lord shall arise upon thee, and his glory shall be seen upon thee, and even the Gentiles shall come to thy light." So here Isaiah would tell us that there's coming an age that would be so dark. It would come an age that that even spiritual blindness would be upon the people. But Peter said, but whenever it come to this age, he said, there will be a chosen people. He said, "For God has calling you out of darkness and into this marvelous light." So here we're living in this world, in this unseen world. We're searching for a reality. We're searching uh for something are being called back to this place that God has created us from. And there's something in us that is calling us or bringing us into another realm. And friends, let me tell you that call is to bring you out of the state that you're in into another state. You say, "Well, what state is that?" This is what Paul is speaking of in Hebrews 11 when he would start this chapter. He's introducing what faith does to a believer. In other words, he's showing you how to access or enter in to another world that you can't see with your natural eye. Paul said through faith, we understand that the worlds were framed by the word of God. Now, we know he wasn't talking about two earths or three earths there. There's not a bunch of earths out there. But when he said worlds, which was a plural word, he was actually speaking of a world that you can see and a world that you can't see. So he said these worlds were were were created or they were framed by the word of God. There's a seen world and there's an unseen world. And then Paul said, "But the things which are seen were not made by things which do appear." Isn't that a paradox? Brother said it's hard to believe, but it's true. It's something that that you can't explain. It's incredible, but it's true. It's a paradox that things that are seen were made by things that do not appear there. The very things that you see, everything that you see that was created, all of that creation, all things that are made were made or are built by Adams and those atoms were created by something that does not even appear. I I thought, isn't it wonderful that the seen world was made by the unseen? And the Bible said it was all made by the word of God. And now, I'll just tell you this this morning, that's the only thing that'll keep it together. I know people look around the world, they say, "Well, the world has fallen apart." But the only thing that's keeping it together is the word of God. That same word that created in the beginning. And that's the only thing that'll keep you together when you start falling apart or keep a family together when a family starts falling apart or keep a marriage together. When a marriage is falling apart, it's the word of God. It's the only thing that binds. It's the only thing that that keeps things together. Satan's always tormenting pressure and tearing apart and bringing pressure upon this earthly life. But God has sent us something in this age that would bring it back together and hold it together. &gt;&gt; See the unseen or the seen was made by the unseen. Now we realize that living on this earth that we live in three dimensions. How many know that there explained what they were? He said it was light, matter and time. That's the three dimensions that we live in. You know, he said and in this in the corporal body here on earth, he said we can't get past these three dimensions. In fact, God has given us five senses. See, taste, feel, smell, and hear. and those senses that God has given this natural man. Your senses were only made to contact those three dimensions. So you can't get outside of those three dimensions with the senses that God has given a natural man. Now you know you think about these these dimensions that we live in and most of most of it we we see we we deal with it every day. We realize what light is and what matter which all things that we see are made up of matter made up of atoms. Adam is the atoms are the building blocks of matter. And so so this is a three-dimensional world. I thought, you know, but if if you take them one at a time, even matter is a three-dimensional thing. All all things have three dimensions. You realize that we live in a three-dimensional world. Me and I was having a math lesson the other day and talking uh talking about formulas and what and what they mean and and uh trying to to get her to remember them. And after a little while, she said, "I don't see the point of this at all. Why does it matter uh how how you find uh uh uh the how much area is in a square and how much area is in a circle? Th this is silly. I'll never use this and what what's it have to do with anything? So, I got to explaining to her that a square is not really a thing. How many knows that a square don't really exist? I know we we think we read it on paper and the teachers show us all the shapes and and the shapes are good to learn because one day you'll use them to apply to the real world that you live in. But but a but a circle or a square, a square is only a concept. It's not a real thing. A square is a geometrical concept. It's a plane. It doesn't exist. Uh it doesn't matter how thin you you know you could take a a piece of paper like this and say well that's a rectangle. Well it's a it's a shape of a rectangle. It's a shape of that concept. But in reality everything has another dimension to it. See a square is a plane. It don't have a third dimension. It's on paper. It's a concept. And so in other words like you would take this bottle and you say well it has a height and it has a width. So that makes it a plane. That that's how that's what a square is on paper. But but that bottle has if it only had a height and a width, you could not put anything in it. It has no depth to it. And so it becomes only two-dimensional. That's why that's what makes an artist a great artist. We we were at at Brother David Silers and they made us draw pictures of our of our wives and husbands and and I found out real quick I I drew the the the picture of my wife. Thank God that picture don't exist. But I found out real quick what a real artist is able to do. And an artist is able to capture the depth of of of this that third dimension on paper. They're they're able not to just draw what you see as a flat, but they're able to make it dimensional. And so it looks like it looks real whenever you see it. And and so so without depth or without that third dimension, then you would never be able to put anything in a bottle. That's what I was showing Annihas. See, a square is not a real a real thing, but a cube is a real thing. So the formula for the square is teaching you how to know how much volume is in a cube. So so one day you you may want to know how much fits in a box. So you calculate the square and then when you add that third dimension that depth now you know how many shoes you can put in the box or how many hair bows you can put in the box or or how many how much volume will fit in that cylinder or fit in that bottle. So it has real life application in three dimensions. But if it only is two-dimensional it has no real application. Are are you with me? So, so in other words without three dimensions only with two dimensions it would say even science would tell you any two-dimensional it's only a geometrical concept and is impossible impossible to be created in the physical world you know I got to thinking about that I thought isn't that the way it is if it only has two dimensions and it has no depth without depth it's only a concept I thought there's a lot of places in this world that take the word of God that way and it's a two-dimensional thing and they they don't like the depth of the word they that don't look look forward to this prophetic ministry that that would bring you into the depths of the word of God. But friends, I've got news for you. Anything that's only two-dimensional and only surface and don't go into the depth of it, it has no volume. It's only a concept. And I've got news for you this morning. I'm not here to gain a religious concept. I I'm not here I want more than a a religious concept or some denominational concept, but I want the reality of the word of God. And let me tell you what it takes. It takes a revelation cuz a prophet of God would tell us that or teach us that a revelation takes you deeper and deeper into the word of God. I thought mine the more revelation you have the deeper you go into the word and the more volume that there is and the more of you that God can pour himself into because you take a revelation of the word of God. Friends, let me tell you, we're not just here to be a two-dimensional Christian. We're but even in the natural, we're not we're not two-dimensional people. We live in a threedimensional world. Everything has three dimensions or it don't exist in the real world. But that ain't the only dimensions. That's only the dimensions of the flesh. It's the dimensions of the natural. But brother, I'm going to say, but also in this realm or in this room, we know there's a fourth dimension and you cannot see it. But but television travels through it and science taps into that dimension. And uh radio waves and television waves and we all know that. We don't have to explain it, but they're going through the building and you can't see what they are, but they're really here. How what could send an image to a satellite and it send it back down to your phone and and and you know we would have never believed that when I was a kid. We' have thought you was the Jetsons or something if you could walk around with a phone and talk to somebody and see their face on a on a screen. But now our kids think that's just the normal the way things is. But although you can't see where it comes from, you can't see how it gets there. He said but it's the four-dimensional world. And so science it contacts through that radio, pictures on TV or television. He says so it proves that there's a fourth dimension. But he said, "But there's more there's more dimensions than that." But also in the fifth dimension there, he said, "The fifth dimension is where the sinner or the unbeliever dies and goes to." In the fifth dimension, he said it's a horrible dimension. It's the place where uh where if somebody would go to sleep at night, and they would, he said, to break it down, a man would have a nightmare. He said, he's not altogether asleep and he's neither awake, but he's between sleep and awake. And it makes a horrible shaking or or it causes a nightmare. He said because it's the it's interacting with that fifth dimension. It's it's a it's a tormentor. That's where these spirits come from that that would torment you in the middle of the night or torment your spirit. Said they're coming from that fifth dimension. He said and and it's a it's such a a horrible place. He said but that's where a man goes to whenever he dies unconverted. Said he's dead on the earth and he can't go into the presence of God because he's not fit to go there without the blood. He hasn't gone through judgment. He cannot come back to the earth because his time's finished here on earth. So he's caught between the earth and that place he says. So he's caught in a nightmare and he's in a nightmare and he stays in that nightmare until the day of judgment. I thought my what a what a frightening place to live or to die unconverted and to live in a nightmare in that in that place just a horrible horrible image. He said, "But then when a Christian dies, he don't go to that place. But a Christian, he goes into the sixth dimension." He said, "In that sixth dimension, that's the place where a Christian goes. It's under the altar of God. Right into the presence of God, under the altar there, he can be at rest." See, all the tormentor can't get to it. Can I just tell you something free this morning? There ain't nothing in the fifth dimension that can torment anything in the sixth dimension. See, it don't have no access. It can't it can't be it can't go into that dimension without being drawn into it. See, you can only go there by invitation. It's a closed door. It ain't something that can be broken into. So when you go to this place of rest, you don't have to worry about on this earth. I know how Satan does and he torments us when you lose loved ones and where they are and what they're going through and all that. That's why the Catholic churches had made so much money because they could use that grief and cause people to give them money to pay people out of one dimension into another. But friends, you can't buy your way in there. You can't cheat your way in there. You can't sneak your way in there. But once you're there, you're at rest because it's a dimension that God has created just like the dimension that we live in that it's not a fearful thing. It's not a scary thing, but it's just like us. Brother Mark, I can sit around and shake your hand. And brother Bam, when he had the vision of going beyond the curtain of time, he said, I believe that's where I was in that sixth dimension. People come up shaking hands and they hugged you and they knew who they were and they were having a great fellowship there. No pain and no suffering like we have over there. He said, "See, it's it's the sixth dimension." He said, "I was in that place in my vision." He said, "I looked back down and saw it." He said, "Because those Can I just give you something free?" It make me about want to shout when I read it. He said, "But because those that are in that dimension, they can contact different than you can contact." He said, "See, your sight can't see there with your natural sight, and you can't contact." He said, "But when I was in that dimension, I could look up on this earth." Remember, he saw his own body laying in a bed. He said because their contact goes far beyond any contact of our natural senses would be able to contact. So don't think it a strange thing when they say well your mama can look down on you or your daddy could look down on you or see things that was going on going on in this world. He said because their contact seas farther than our I don't know about y'all but that makes me about want to shout to think about my grandma that that that would sing some of those glorious gospel songs that could come in and look down on a service or enter into a service in another dimension and have a shouting time over on the other side while just waiting for the saints of God to come and meet in the air. &gt;&gt; He said then there's another dimension that seventh dimension. He said that's where God is. Amen. &gt;&gt; I know what people say when when you get to preaching on this. &gt;&gt; Well, you have to see it. I have to see it in order to believe it. I've been told that. &gt;&gt; Well, you know, that ain't really true &gt;&gt; because there's many things that are widely accepted that you can't see. &gt;&gt; How about wind? You can't see wind, &gt;&gt; but everybody accept it accepts it as a thing, but you can't see it. &gt;&gt; Nobody knows where it is. You know, you can't you can't you can't you can't actually see it. How about love? You can't see love. But when they bring the grandbaby in the room and there's something in your heart starts to be said, "What is it? It's love. I can't see it. I couldn't I couldn't open up a heart and find love in a heart that's nothing you could see with a natural eye, but it's really there." How about a life that's in a seed? You take a seed out of a package, you couldn't dissect that seed. You'd never be able to find life in the seed. There's no Where is life there? It doesn't have a compartment in the seed. There's nothing in it that would say it was alive. But when you put it in the ground in the right atmosphere and the sunlight and the water gets on it, all of a sudden it comes to life and it begins to grow. It could lay there a hundred years dormant but just a few days in the presence of the right atmosphere it begins to grow. So although you can't ex can't see it, brother Mark, but still yet we accept it. You say, "Well, why do we accept things that we can't see?" Well, you accept it because of the effect that it has on the seen world. Oh, hallelujah. See, it's an unseen thing, but you accept it. And you know, you know what that proves to us? It it's proof of the unseen is the effect that it has on the scene. That's the very proof of the unseen world is the effect that it has on the seen world. You know why? Because anytime the unseen begins to interact with the seen world, then there's always a movement. When the wind that's unseen interacts with an unseen world, the wind the the leaves begin to move and the grass begins to blow. And you may not can see the wind, but you see the effect that it has on the world. When love begins to interact with an unseen world, you tell me what causes it causes a movement. You see an act of love, a true love act expressed. How come it is when you watch when you watch something or see a an an expression of love, it brings tears to your eyes and it softens our heart? What I it's a movement. Anytime the unseen interacts with the scene, it brings a movement. When a when a seed comes to lie, it begins to break open and the soil has to move back and the dirt has to get out of its way and the rocks are pushed aside and it moves up through the ground. Why? Because anytime the unseen interacts with the seen world, there's always a movement. And friends, let me tell you this that the devil has always been trying to to pull you into darkness and he's trying to pull you into wrapped you all up in that fifth dimension. But I thank God that there's a God today that is not allowing the church to be drawn into that dimension or into that into that old world, INTO THAT SATANIC REALM. BUT THERE'S A GOD that is drawing us into OUR HEAVENLY HOME. AND [laughter] WE'VE BEEN CONTACTED FROM ANOTHER DIMENSION, Brother Mark. It ain't the region of the lost. It ain't some pits of hell somewhere, but it's a heavenly DIMENSION THAT GOD IS CALLING THE CHURCH INTO this morning. &gt;&gt; As much evils in the world that ought to make you believe in God. As much as there's a reality of a fifth dimension, it ought to make you a believer of a sixth dimension, &gt;&gt; a believer of a place you can be with God. See, he's drawn you into another dimension, a heavenly dimension, in a dimension where God can use you. See, because in that other dimension, in this sixth dimension, that's where the supernatural is. That's where the the the miracle the miracles take place. It it's in another dimension. It's outside of this seen world of this three-dimensional world. You remember when David would write of the suffering of Christ in the book of Psalms, he wrote about how Christ suffered. But remember said, watch. He said it was Christ standing back here in David. He said David couldn't even think. His mind had gone from him. And David in his mind, are you ready for this? David in his mind was hanging on a cross like you see the statue hanging on the cross and he was crying, "My God, my God, why hast thou forsaken me? By bones, they stare at me. They pierce my hands and my feet. They thrust my side. Why are thou so far from me? The bulls of Bashan can pass out. They wagged their heads saying he trusted in God and he would deliver him. But now let's see if he'll deliver him. He was speaking the same words that Christ would speak. He said, "But when God was made manifest on earth," notice he said the same words that David did. He said, you see, because it wasn't the word of a man, it was the word of God. He said there was God in David. It wasn't David. He didn't know what he was saying at all. He was just so in the spirit. You said, "Well, how much in the spirit was he?" Can I tell you the example? He said, "That's the way it was with Moses. He was so much in the spirit that he literally passed out of this dimension that he was living in and he stood there face to face in a burning bush and he was talking to GOD HIMSELF." THAT'S WHY other people could walk by and they couldn't see what Moses saw. That's why the burning bush, it wasn't consumed because it was interacting with another dimension. But whenever Moses walked along, oh my, to think that he walked along in the wilderness long enough until one day HE WALKED, DIDN'T EVEN KNOW WHAT HE WAS DOING. HE WAS WALKING IN THIS THREE-DIMENSIONAL WORLD, BUT ONE DAY HE STEPPED OUT OF ONE DIMENSION AND INTO ANOTHER. AND IN THAT DIMENSION, THE SUPERNATURAL BE TO TAKE PLACE. IN THAT DIMENSION, A BUSH, IT CAUGHT ON FIRE, BUT IT WAS NOW CONSUMED. AND IT DREW HIM MIXED IN THIS THREE-DIMENSIONAL WORLD. HE WAS INTERACTING WITH ANOTHER DIMENSION. THAT'S WHY DAVID COULD COULD FEEL THE SUFFERING of Christ. He was in another dimension seeing what you know let me tell you because that other dimension it's not affected by time. We live in time, light and matter. But when you get out of that dimension that's why a prophet of God can go so far in time and say this is the way it's going to be. OR HE COULD GO SO BACK IN TIME. HE CAN SAY THIS IS THE WAY IT WAS because he entered into ANOTHER DIMENSION THAT'S FAR BEYOND THE DIMENSION that we live in. He &gt;&gt; said, "I imagine." He stood there in that other dimension. Take off your shoes for the ground you're standing on is holy ground. He said, "I imagine when Moses left there, he thought, what just happened?" &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Imagine when he left there, what just happened? &gt;&gt; He stepped into another dimension &gt;&gt; and he interacted with God. &gt;&gt; Might think he just walking one day and walk right out of this dimension into another. Amen. &gt;&gt; Says, "See, you know what that tells us is the door to that dimension is not up there in the clouds somewhere. &gt;&gt; It's not way off in the clouds somewhere that you you have to climb some ladder or go to some temple in Jerusalem or go to some place out in the wilderness to be able to find God, the doorway, it's not there, but it's all around us. Wherever Moses was, &gt;&gt; he was walking in the wilderness. David, wherever David was, maybe he was sitting in a in a house, maybe he was sitting on a hillside. I don't know where he was, but wherever David was while he was there, he entered into that dimension. &gt;&gt; Wherever you are, whether it's at home or whether it's a church or walking in the woods, driving down the road, but is able to enter into another dimension. The door is all around us. Brother man preached Jehovah Gyra. Remember the lady was sitting in the meeting. He said, "Ma'am, you with black gloves and hands like this, raise your hand. Look at me." He said, 'If I quote to you your prayer that you were praying, he said, 'I just heard it in another dimension and tell you what you're praying about, will you believe that Jesus heard your prayer and this is his anointing? &gt;&gt; Who hears prayer? Only Christ. &gt;&gt; He said, "But I heard it in another dimension." Don't that answer some questions? How how how could you hear it or see what was taking place? Because it's not confined by light or matter or time. It's in another dimension. He said, "You were playing for praying for a bladder condition and you were praying for a colon condition, asking God to have me to speak to you. Is that right?" I want you to stand to your feet just a minute so the people will know. Turn around to the audience. He said, "Do you believe?" Well, don't fear, sister. You're going to be well. &gt;&gt; Said, "Why do I say that? Isn't that what you'd ask?" Well, why would you say that? He said, "Because that darkness that was around you, it went away and that light was over there. It came right to where you were. What was it?" It wasn't some strange thing. It was just a prophet of God that had stepped into another dimension that could see that demonic spirits that were tormenting people. No wonder you could look at somebody and see what they were going through. That's what the Holy Ghost does. It finds the things in our life and things that we need help and things that were tormented in our flesh, but that light of God would come and overshadow. See, he was entered into another dimension. He said it turned light around you. First it was a dark shadow, but now that light come down and you accepted it. He said, "Now go believe and don't you doubt." He said, "Oh, don't you believe what you're told?" He said, "Surely, if he knew what your past was, then he knows what your future will be." Surely, if he's not confined by time and he's in another dimension that you can go back here and say, "I know what you were just NOW PRAYING. I KNOW WHAT you said because you're in another dimension. SO, LET ME WALK BACK OVER HERE AND HEAR what the prayer was." Yes. Yes. YES. NOW, LET ME GO BACK HERE AND TELL YOU WHAT THE RESULT OF IT IS. This is the WAY IT SHALL BE. BECAUSE YOU'RE NOT WALKING IN THESE THREE DIMENSIONS. YOU'RE NOT BOUND BY THIS THREE-DIMENSIONAL WORLD, BUT HE WAS WALKING in another dimension. &gt;&gt; Oh my. He said, "Stand up." Boy, she was standing up the and let the audience see what what God had done for you. And then while she was standing there, I love this. He said, "Oh, another thing, one more thing, lady." He said, "That deep walk with God you're seeking." He said, "That's right. It's true. You're going to receive it now." No, sis. I'm not reading your mind. I'm just telling you the desire of your heart and what your prayer is. Why? because he was in another dimension. &gt;&gt; He entered into another dimension. Do you realize what that means is God can use you as much of you as you'll let God use. &gt;&gt; I know what people say. Well, that was a prophet. And I believe that. I don't believe God's going to do everything he done with a with a with a word prophet with everybody or even a a minor prophet or or a New Testament preacher. How you know, not everybody has that gift. I I I don't believe that that I believe that was a messiahic sign that God had used in this age to be able to call a people out of darkness into light. It it was to to call us by the message of the hour to our redeemed body. It was it was the it was the calling back to redemption. And so that was the purpose of the whole message. It was redemption. But that don't mean that God can't use you. And it don't mean that God can't bring you into that other dimension. It don't mean that you're not interacting with that other dimension. You you realize that God can use every one of us. I Oh, I I I feel that. I I know how it is because because we pick and choose who God can use. &gt;&gt; Hello, somebody. &gt;&gt; We pick and choose who God can use. Well, God can use them because, you know, after all, they're great and he can't use this one because they're little. You know, maybe I'm too little for God to use and I'm not good enough and I I they you know, and the best one is, well, they go to my church so God can use them. By the way, aren't they miracle workers? But if they don't go to my church, God can't use them. You know, after all, God God only does things right here. That's a lie of the pits of hell. &gt;&gt; God can use anybody. Let me tell you what God can. He said, "See, because we we pick who God uses and who God can't use and and you know how you know how believe, you know, let me may as well get into it and where we're here now." So, but but but but we say, "Well, well, God can't use them because they don't believe like I do. So, therefore, God can't use them." Isn't that the attitude that people gets? But let me tell you, friends, I can tell you what a prophet said. Because we say, "Well, they don't believe the whole word and they don't believe just like me." And and you know, maybe maybe they don't believe all the things I believe, but God can't use them and they're all lost and they're all going to hell. They don't believe in healing, so they must be going to hell. They don't believe in discernment, so they must be going to hell. They must all be lost. And and people get these attitudes where where everybody's lost &gt;&gt; because they don't believe just like you believe. Can I tell you what a prophet said? Remember when he told the story of Abraham and Lot? He said Lot wanted the world. He said he was a type of a carnal believer who didn't think these things were true and he went on down into Sodom. Am I running out of time? Thank you, brother Brian. I'm gonna ask you that. But but he said Lot was a carnal believer. You never ask a question you don't know the answer to. That's some free wisdom. So Lot was a believer. Lot Lot was a a carnal believer. He says, see, he was a he was a carnal believer. He didn't know these things were true. So he just went on down into Sodom. He said, 'But all these believers, he said, we could go on for hours. These believers, all believers are like change in out of your pocket in God's hands. He said, when you pull out change out of your pocket, there's pennies and nickels and dimes and quarters and half dollars, and they're all in coins. He said, "That's the way the world is in God's hand. There are some people that just can have a penny's worth of it, and God can only use them in a penny weight, and that's all they can buy." But are you ready for it? He said, "But don't reject them if they can't believe the real truth. Don't turn them down. Don't kick them out and say they're not in it." Because God, are you ready? Because God uses pennies sometimes. &gt;&gt; They may not be THE SAME. THEY MAY NOT BELIEVE EVERYTHING LIKE YOU BELIEVE IT. THEY MAY NOT SEE EVERYTHING LIKE YOU SEE IT. BUT DON'T GET THAT. I KNOW THE ATTITUDE THAT PEOPLE GET. BUT CAN I CAN I just preach to YOU THIS MORNING? WE'RE NOT THE PEOPLE THAT'S GOING AROUND TELLING EVERYBODY they're lost and they're going to hell because you don't believe like I DO OR CUZ YOU DON'T UNDERSTAND THAT THE WAY I DO OR BECAUSE YOU DON'T SEE IT THE WAY I DO. WELL, HELL'S GOING TO BE GOOD FOR YOU. WE AIN'T THEM KIND OF PEOPLE. I DON'T HAVE THAT kind of an attitude. BUT I I THERE MAY BE SOME PEOPLE IN THE MESSAGE THAT WAY, but it ain't me. I don't believe the message was sent to go into the world and to condemn it and discourage and to bind people and TO PERSECUTE THEM OR FELLOW MAN. BUT I BELIEVE IT WAS SENT TO EXEMPLIFY Jesus Christ and bring redemption to A LOST AND A DYING GENERATION. And I believe whenever it's taught correctly and the message that God sent in this hour ever gets in the human heart, THEN THE HEART OF THE PROPHET OF GOD WOULD DROP IN YOUR HEART and the love for your fellow MAN WOULD BE EXEMPLIFIED THROUGH YOUR LIFE AND YOU'LL DO NOTHING BUT BUT DRAW PEOPLE INTO THAT DIMENSION THAT GOD HAS BROUGHT YOU INTO. SAID, "We weren't sent to do that." But remember said, "Lot was just a penny. Abraham was a silver dollar. It may take a hundred lots to make an Abraham." I've heard that preached, but it was never in this context. Said God was made, it was it was made to separate and put out and stuff like that, but that's nonsense. He said a 100 carnal believers, they wouldn't stand in the presence of a genuine Christian that's separated from the carnal things of the world living in Christ Jesus where the word can flow through them. There is a difference. There is a separation. There is a difference. But it don't make them worthless. It don't make somebody worthless because they don't believe like you do or or they don't see things the way you see it. He said he can only take a penny's worth. That's all he's got. He said, "So people say, are you ready?" He said, "So if people say I don't believe in healing and I don't believe in these things, just know it's a penny and let him alone. It's just a penny's worth and that's all they can buy. Don't stop him. Just let him alone." Remember that's as far as he can go. And then brother Brandham even feels convicted about the statement that he made and he says now I didn't mean that hardly the way I said it. He said I mean well I belong to this talking about people belonging to certain denominations and I this the way my church believes you know he said I belong to this and that's just WHAT WE BELIEVE. HE SAID IT'S JUST A PENNY JUST GO AHEAD see it's just a penny and say well Lord bless you my brother. See he is copper. He can be he can never be silver. So why are you trying to make him silver? He said that's the WAY IT IS. JUST GO AHEAD. BUT GOD CAN USE HIM. &gt;&gt; He is using it. HE SAID, "AND I'D RATHER SEE HIM DOWN HERE in a church than to see him in a barroom standing there on the corner, wouldn't you?" He said, "SO JUST LET IT ALONE. GOD CAN USE IT ANYHOW. HE MIGHT NOT USE IT VERY MUCH, BUT HE'LL use what he can use as much as THEY WILL LET GOD USE THEM." &gt;&gt; You know, friends, you know what that means? That means we all just OUGHT TO BE CHANGED IN GOD'S hands and say, "God, use me how you see fit." Quit judging the whole world and saying, "Well, they're they're all lost and they're all wrong and THEY'RE ALL DYING AND GOING TO HELL AND BECOME LIKE A A PROPHET OF GOD IN THE HEART OF A PROPHET OF GOD AND SAY, BUT YOU KNOW, SOME MAY SPEND A QUARTER'S WORTH. Some may spend A DOLLAR'S WORTH, SOME MAY BE A NICKEL'S WORTH, BUT I THANK GOD THAT THEY'RE ALL CHANGED IN THE HANDS OF THE CREATOR. just be changed &gt;&gt; in God's hands and let God suspend you &gt;&gt; as he sees fit. &gt;&gt; It's so easy to get a spirit to put everybody out. &gt;&gt; I don't know where that come from. &gt;&gt; What kind of believer when a prophet of God said that the cry of the bride was mercy? &gt;&gt; Then what kind of believer that's called the bride of Jesus Christ would cry judgment upon people &gt;&gt; when the cry of your heart should be mercy to the world? It ought to be to open A DOOR INTO THAT DIMENSION TO ALLOW PEOPLE TO ENTER INTO IT. IT OUGHT TO BE TO TO TO INTERACT WITH THEM IN A IN A WAY THAT THEY WOULD WANT more of God. &gt;&gt; That's the heart of God. &gt;&gt; You know, I've collected a lot of coins. You know, in my experience of collecting coins, any of you that's ever looked at coin values, sometimes a coin's worth more than it appears at face value anyway. It may look like a penny &gt;&gt; and it may say penny all over it, but don't you dare judge its worth. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Cuz you know what it's worth. The Denver mint 1943, they took some pennies and they accidentally uh minted some of them with bronze. One of them sold for $2 million. &gt;&gt; It's a penny. I don't have one, but it's a penny, &gt;&gt; but it was worth $2 million. You know, it's copper on the outside, but the market looked like copper. People spent it. They had it in their hand. They spent it. Spent it in a store. Somebody bought a Somebody bought a bag of chips with it. 1943 and a Coke. But But today, it's worth $2 million. See, because what was on the outside didn't reflect what was on the inside. &gt;&gt; On the inside, it had more value. &gt;&gt; There was some other qualities on the inside of it that made it a different kind of metal. It wasn't copper. It was made of bronze. You know, you know what that means? That means we just need to be coined in God's hands. &gt;&gt; God, I I I I don't know. I don't feel like I'm worth anyway. Most of the time, it's the ones that don't feel like they're worth is actually are worth more. The ones that don't feel like they're worth very much. That's the ones that are really valuable. You ever notice how bronze is made? Can I take a second? You ever notice how bronze is made? You know, you know, copper is a softer metal, but after the Stone Age became the Bronze Age, if you study history, the remember the Bronze Age, which which in the the Stone Age, Bronze Age, Iron Age, we're still in that age, but but in the they're trying to make it a new computer age, whatever. But but but in the Bronze Age, they they uh they actually found tools or or weapons. It was the advancement of civilization and advancement of of of people growing together, development of of riding systems and all that. But in that age, the reason it's called a bronze age is because they discovered something that was harder than a stone. And so they actually took copper, which was a metal, and took tin, which was a softer metal. Like, you know, tin is so soft you can bend it. And it was such an odd thing because how however they they discovered it, but but whenever they added tin to copper, it actually made copper harder. It formed what was called bronze. And so there's a whole age of how that was formed. And you know, I thought, isn't it something that you could add tin to copper and it actually made copper harder? Isn't that something that you would take? Because usually if you add something weaker to something that's stronger, it only weakens it. If you had a cup of coffee, I know this from I know my me and my wife, we we we do this experiment all the time, but if you have a pot of coffee and you add water to the pot of coffee, it weakens it, you know. So So the more because co because water is weak of coffee. It's it's 100% no coffee. So the weaker when you pour the weaker into the stronger the the it becomes weaker and weaker and weaker and weaker and weaker. But when it come to copper you could add tin to copper and copper and tin is softer. But when you would add tin to copper it would make that thing that was stronger than it actually stronger or more strengthen. I I thought it's such a paradox to think that because we think weak and weaker thing ought to make something weaker. It shouldn't make it stronger. But my whenever whenever I whenever I uh read about that, I thought, isn't that isn't that what Paul's message was in first or in second Corinthians and he said, "I I was I had my infirmities and I went to God with my infirmities and and I talked to him about how I needed help and deliverance." And and when I prayed for my infirmities, he said to me, "My grace is sufficient for thee, for my strength is made perfect in your weakness." I thought, "Isn't that something that the strength or the power of God is perfected by something that was weaker than it?" He said, "My strength or my power was made perfect by your weakness." So in other words, that's why Paul said that I would gladly glory in my infirmities that the power of Christ may rest upon me. Therefore, I don't hang my head in condemnation for the weakness of my flesh. For the strength of God or the power of God has been made PERFECT BY MY WEAKNESS. IT WAS A weaker thing that was added to a stronger thing, but it MADE THE STRONGER THING EVEN STRONGER. It perfected IT. IT GAVE IT ITS STRENGTH. I I THOUGHT MIKE, CAN YOU IMAGINE how the weakness OF HUMANITY WOULD STRENGTHEN THE POWER OF GOD? &gt;&gt; But this is what he told Paul. It's made perfect in your weakness. You know, you know that word power, he said, "My strength is made perfect." That that word strength come from the word dunamis, which was power. And it's used to describe the power of God. So we, you know, you find in the New Testament that the word power is mentioned many times in the New Testament, but there's many different meanings. It may be talking about dominion or authority or control or or or energy. All these different Greek words that were used to define power, inertia, iscus, strength, physical, internal strength, all these words that are used to define power. But when it comes to this scripture, he said, "For my strength is made perfect in weakness." That word strength come from the Greek word dunamis. And that word dunamis is defining the miraculous power of God or a dynamite power, a miraculous power. It's something. It's something that that uh uh the best part about it when he talks about my strength is when you use this word dunamis, it's referring to a power that is residing in something waiting to be exerted. &gt;&gt; So it's not because you can grow strength by going and lifting. You know, you could lift up and lift up and build up. There was nothing in there. You actually built it. Cause muscles to tear down and build up and become stronger. But that wouldn't be dunamis power. Dunamis power is something that is laying in something by virtue of its nature. In other words, what we call a rock a rock because of its nature, right? You knock on Carter's head, you say it's hard as a &gt;&gt; Thank you. And so because but but we say that because he's got a hard head and so but ask ask Jonah. His head he's got a hard head. And so but but [clears throat] we call a rock a rock because it is hard. So by virtue of its nature, it has its identity. So when we talk about the power of God or this dunamis power of God, it's it's by virtue of its nature. In other words, God is a powerful God or miraculous God. It's by virtue of his nature. In other words, this power is residing in a place and it's waiting to be used. It's waiting to be exerted. That's what dunamis means. That's why so he said my dunamis, can I just say it in the Greek? My dunamis is made perfect in your weakness. So the power of God, this residing power of God that's by the virtue of the nature of God, it's laying within God waiting to be expressed or waiting TO BE EXERTED. BUT GOD SAID, "BUT MY MY DUNAMIS, my strength is made perfect in your weakness." In other words, God, it's laying in God. It's the the miraculous power of God laying in God. But it took the WEAKNESS OF HUMANITY FOR GOD TO BE ABLE TO EXPRESS HIS MIRACULOUS POWER. AND FOR it took the weakness of our flesh for a miracle to be performed. It took a A A DEAD TO DIE THAT GOD COULD RAISE THE DEAD. IT TOOK A MAN TO be blind that he could raise that he could open the BLINDED EYES. IT TOOK A MAN THAT WAS LOST THAT GOD COULD SAVE HIM. THE MIRACULOUS POWER OF GOD. IT TOOK THE WEAKNESS of humanity in order to be to be perfected in its strength. &gt;&gt; I thought, my that's our that's our God. Even better, can I tell you this? The spirit of God that spoke to Paul, it has that quality, that dunamis power of God, this miraculous power of God, but it didn't remain in God. Because that word dunamis when Paul preached or or spoke in second Timothy he said for God has not given us the spirit of fear &gt;&gt; but of power by the way it was dunamis &gt;&gt; but of power and of love and of a sound mind. &gt;&gt; So that same miraculous power that was made perfect in God by your weakness. That's the power that Paul's talked about when he said and God GAVE YOU NOT THE spirit of fear but the but of power and of love and of sound mind. And so that same miraculous power that was made perfect by your WEAKNESS IS THE SAME POWER OF GOD THAT WAS POURED INTO THE CHURCH. IT WASN'T TO HAVE CONTROL OR TO HAVE DOMINION over people or authority OVER YOUR FELLOW MAN STUFF LIKE BUT IT WAS THE POWER OF GOD. THE DUNAMIS POWER OF GOD THAT WAS POURED out of GOD THAT WAS POURED INTO the church. Friends, let me tell you, God doesn't have that power to withhold it in himself because dunamis power by definition it was a power that is waiting to be exerted. IT IS THERE WAITING FOR FOR ITS OPPORTUNITY TO EXERT ITSELF. He said SO HE ONLY HAD IT SO SO THAT HE COULD MIX IT with our weakness so it could be strengthened that it might become perfect. And now that same power that was residing in God is residing in the church. &gt;&gt; Said so it was poured out into the church. Remember he poured himself into Christ. All that was in Christ was poured into the church. And now that same miraculous power was pulled into the poured into the church. That's and now that kind of a power I it's waiting it's residing in the church waiting for an opportunity to be exerted &gt;&gt; just like it was in God. &gt;&gt; In other words, you know what it's looking for? It's looking for a weakness somewhere that it could exert itself. &gt;&gt; I just love it. &gt;&gt; It's looking for a a failure somewhere that it could exert itself. It's the power of God that he poured into the church. It's looking for a sickness somewhere that it could exert itself. Why? Because it is a MIRACULOUS POWER. IT CAME OUT OF ANOTHER ANOTHER DIMENSION. IT WASN'T CREATED IN THESE THREE DIMENSIONS. It's the power of God. See, that same power is residing in the church. See, but notice the characteristic of this power is it's waiting on an opportunity. And when it's opportunity comes, are you ready for it? I'm going to hurry and close. But when its opportunity comes, it becomes a force. &gt;&gt; So that very power, it's not just sitting there forever, brother Mark. It's waiting by by by definition. and it's waiting to be exerted. And whenever it's exerted, it becomes a force. In other words, this miraculous power of God that is poured into the the believer, it's laying there. It's an inherent power. You may not see it with a natural eye. It may be like a life that's laying in a seed and you can't even identify it. And you can look at its flesh and you can't identify it nowhere, but it's laying in there. It's a dunamis power of God. It's laying in there residing in there by virtue of its nature. how you were created in the beginning by your nature. You're a son of God. You always was a son of God. And that's laying in there waiting to be exerted. And when it's exerted, it becomes a force in your life. THAT'S WHY YOUR LIFE TAKES CHANGE. THAT'S WHY THE things of the world, THEY GET SHAKEN OFF OF YOU. THAT'S WHY HABITS DISAPPEAR. THAT'S WHY OLD HABIT AND OLD PROBLEMS AND PROBLEMS WITH THE FLESH. THAT'S WHY YOU OVERCOME THEM. AND BEFORE YOU WAS A SLAVE TO SIN AND NOW YOU BECOME AN OVERCOMER BECAUSE THE MIRACULOUS POWER OF GOD HAS BEEN EXERTED IN YOUR LIFE. AND FROM THE INSIDE OUT COMES SOMETHING THAT'S BUBBLING OUT AND TAKES OVER THE FLESH OF A FAILING HUMAN BEING. &gt;&gt; It's a miraculous power of God &gt;&gt; waiting to be exerted forth. &gt;&gt; Remember that spring brother walked by. &gt;&gt; He said went down there. He said, "Spring, why are you always bubbling?" &gt;&gt; He said went down drink. He said, ' If I could just talk to What makes you bubble? Is it the cows that drank from you? You're bubbling. No, that wasn't it. Was it the deer? No, that wasn't it. Why are you bubbling all the time? Maybe because I drank from you. Maybe you're giving life to a human being, the the the greatest of God's creation. Is that is that is that what it is that caused you to bubble? No, that ain't it. He said, "Well, what caused you to bubble?" He said, "There's something down on the inside of me, way deep down that is pushing up. &gt;&gt; You realize that the surface OF THE SPRING DON'T EVEN KNOW WHAT IT IS. there's something way down deep in the bedrock of the earth that that is pushing us and causing it to come to this place. He and brother said that's the way it is with a born again experience. He said you can't contain it because we're not a man-made water tank. It's a well of water within you bubbling up into everlasting life. He said the man-made tank, it'll freeze. They're begging for a revival and everything. But a man that's under the fountain or the living in the fountain, IT'S DAY AND NIGHT. HE ain't walking around looking to be picked up and looking to be revived, dragging him from one church service to another. WON'T SOMEBODY SAY SOMETHING THAT CAN MAKE ME CLAP AND MAKE ME SHOUT AND SOMEBODY SAY SOMETHING THAT CAN MAKE ME FEEL BETTER? I'VE HAD JUST A BAD IT AIN'T ALWAYS A BAD WEEK. SOMETIMES YOU CAN HAVE A GOOD WEEK. &gt;&gt; SOMETIMES YOU CAN HAVE A GOOD DAY AT WORK. SOMETIMES YOU CAN HAVE A GOOD DAY AT HOME. EVERYTHING AIN'T GOT TO ALWAYS BE MULLY grubs and down. EVERYTHING'S DOWN AROUND ME. STOP LOOKING TO THE NEGATIVE OF EVERYTHING IN your life AND LOOK TO THE POSITIVE AND THINK ABOUT WHAT GOD'S DONE TODAY. HOW ABOUT GET UP IN THE MORNING AND SAY, "GOD, I THANK YOU FOR THE BREATH IN MY BODY. I THANK YOU FOR THE ABILITY TO GO TO WORK. I THANK YOU FOR THE THE FAMILY THAT YOU'RE GIVING ME." SOMETIMES IT DON'T HAVE TO BE NEGATIVE. &gt;&gt; IT AIN'T ALWAYS WHAT'S HAPPENING, WHAT'S FALLING APART, BUT WHAT IS GOD DOING? HOW GREAT HE IS, HOW WONDERFUL GOD IS. THERE'S SOMETHING THAT'S A REVIVAL THAT'S BUBBLING UP IN you all the time. He said, "What is it?" He said, "You don't have to Can I Can I just finish this?" He said, "You don't have to wait on local rains and local revivals. You don't have to wait on a rain TO COME. SOMEBODY DUMP SOME WATER OUT. LET LET SOME RAIN COME SO I CAN HAVE SOMETHING BUBBLING IN ME." YOU AIN'T WAITING ON THAT. HE SAID, "BECAUSE IT DON'T COME FROM THE SURFACE. IT CAME FROM THE FOUNTAIN OF LIFE THAT'S BUBBLING UP ON THE INSIDE. IT'S THE UNADULTERATED WORD OF God in your heart AND IN YOUR MOUTH, VINDICATING ITSELF AND SPEAKING OUT. It don't matter if it's raining or snowing. &gt;&gt; It don't matter what it is on the surface &gt;&gt; because it comes from something on the inside. &gt;&gt; Said it's a hidden power and it secret is within it. &gt;&gt; That's why it's so strange to the man in the natural world to see a believer going through so many things. Glory. Isn't God so good? What do you mean God's good? Your cars broke down. You can't afford your house payment. Your dog died. What do you mean God's good? It'd be wonderful, God. Why? Because our revival don't come from the things that take place in this natural world, &gt;&gt; but it's something on the inside. &gt;&gt; Said this, it's a hidden power. It secret is within it. Said, "And because it has that, it gives of itself freely to whoever will drink of its substance." So, see, so when you get that well springing up, you're drinking up by there. There's no difference. You'll give to anything that comes by. you're willing to give the hope of life to a Catholic, &gt;&gt; to a Protestant, to a Jew, to an atheist, whatever it is, you're really, really got something in you that's doing it, and you'll give to anything &gt;&gt; that comes by. &gt;&gt; Isn't that wonderful? We're not withholding, but we're giving. Said, "There's another thing about it. Can I tell you one more thing about it?" &gt;&gt; He said, "You don't have to pump it up. &gt;&gt; You don't have to pull on it. You don't have to pump it up." He said, he said, "I've seen so much of that, it makes me sick." Playing a bunch of music, jumping up and down, pumping up all the literature out of town, talking about the man of the hour coming. That there ain't but one man of the hour and his name is Jesus Christ. He's the same yesterday, today, and forever. There is only one messenger from God, and his name is Jesus Christ. That's what was present in this hour. That's what was present in the five-fold ministry. That's what was present in a prophet of God. It was Jesus Christ. That's the ministry that we're here to promote. that he's present in this hour. That he ain't a dead God 2,000 years ago. But we're proving the resurrection OF JESUS CHRIST BY PREACHING THE VERY MESSAGE OF THE HOUR THAT WAS A VINDICATION OF THE RESURRECTION OF Christ Jesus. Said, I'm living. I'm the fountain of living water. We're living under this fountain. There's something in it that's causing it to bubble up as the music players want to come. You think about a spring. You know what happens in a spring? Down in the bottom of that spring, can I just read this to you? in the bottom of that spring that there's a heat and pressure in the bedrock of the earth and that carbon dioxide it adds into the water and the quantity of carbon dioxide is above saturation level at surface and so at surface because there's more carbon dioxide down there when it gets to surface it makes a bubble you know when it comes to atmospheric pressure so it's under pressure way down here and as it's creating something within it when it comes to atmospheric pressure can I just say the surface when it comes to the surface that which was within becomes evident on the you wouldn't know the carbon dioxide was in there underneath you may not ever see it but when it comes to that surface or under atmospheric pressure all of a sudden it expresses itself &gt;&gt; it just pops right up there on the top &gt;&gt; it's expressed on the surface and the result is bubbles and I love this it's it's bubbles in in in in the form of semi-persistent effervescence which means with vivacity and enthusiasm on the surface is public with enthusiasm. &gt;&gt; That ain't what a spring looks like. Drink if you want it. &gt;&gt; That's a stagnated pond. &gt;&gt; But we're not talking about stagnated ponds. We're talking about something that has life on the inside. It's pumping up. It's bubbling up. You let me tell you the best part about a spring. There's nothing you can do to the surface of it that can change what it's doing. &gt;&gt; It don't matter what you do to it. The bubbles are going to come up. You can block them over here. They're going to come up over here. You can put their hand down over here, don't you? And they're going to hum up over here. You can't worship God in this church. They're going to go somewhere else and worship God. You can't cope. You can't keep a bubble down &gt;&gt; because there's something on the inside of it that is looking for a way &gt;&gt; to express what is growing. &gt;&gt; There's something way down in there. There's a pressure. &gt;&gt; There's a burning. &gt;&gt; No matter what you do, you can hit it with sticks, it'll keep bubbling. You can throw dirt on it, it'll keep bubbling. &gt;&gt; You can talk about it, it'll bubble. You can make fun of it, it'll bubble. No matter what you do to it, it's bubbling. &gt;&gt; Because the bubble didn't come from the surface. &gt;&gt; It came from way down, &gt;&gt; far beyond your ability to even reach. In the core, &gt;&gt; in the core of the earth, where the temperature is so extreme, there's a fire burning. And in that core of that burning fire, something is created and heat and pressure begins to [music] build this and it works its way to the surface. That's what's happening in you. Way down in the core, sometimes it's so far beyond the surface, you'd think it's never going to happen. You look at some people, it'll never happen. But way down in the core, there's something there far beyond our ability to see, there's a fire that's burning. And you know what happens? The more heat it goes through, the more fire it goes through, the more it bubbles. The more it's created, so it doesn't matter how much the devil don't know what to do with it. No matter how much he puts on it, the it bubbles the more. You know why? There's something in you. So what is it? It's the power of almighty God, the creator of heaven and earth. And the more pressure that you have, but John, the more you overcome. Can I say it like this? The more of my weakness that I give to Jesus, the more power that I have. The more of my weakness I give to Jesus, the more victory that I have. The more of my weakness I give to Jesus, the more joy that I have. Friends, I got news for you. We're not a powerless people. &gt;&gt; You're not a powerless person. You're not a powerless church. But God's people are a powerful people. &gt;&gt; And their power don't come. It's not created in this world. It's not created in these dimensions. I know we may feel that way. We feel like we're weak in the flesh and we're limited in our abilities and we're bound by these these five senses and everything around us. We're so bound by it because that's the dimension that we live in. But you know what happens when God gets a hold of you? You know what happens? You remember you remember what happened with David when he went down there. Won't you stand to your feet? He went down there to that that battle of Goliath and he went he went down to the brook and he took those five stones and walked down and that great giant stood there before the people of God and and David took one of those stones and he put it in his sling and he whirled it around and he slung it at that big old giant said and the Holy Ghost got a hold of that stone. Man said it don't matter how weak you are it was just a stone. We did a play down at at Louisiana camp one time when I was young, when I was just a boy. And uh I I got to come back home. I said, "Mom, I was in the play." She said, "Oh, good." "Well," I said, "Well, it was a play of David and Goliath." She said, "Well, which one was you? I get I bet you was David." I went, "No, I was the rock." She said, "The rock." I said, "Yeah, there had to be a Goliath. There had to be a David. There had to be a stone. I was the smallest guy in there. So, I got to be the stone." And they threw me at Goliath and I took him down. I thought, "You know what? That's way that's what brother Bam said. He said whenever David threw that that stone, he said the Holy Ghost got a hold of that stone. &gt;&gt; In other words, when the Holy Ghost got a hold of it, it went a million miles a minute. You know why? Because it went into another dimension. The Holy Ghost don't come from this dimension. It took it into another dimension that's not conflicted by time. And it took it to a speed that it didn't matter where it hit the giant AT IT. IT'S FAST AND IT'S ACCURATE. AND IT ALWAYS HITS ITS mark because the Holy Ghost got a hold of that stone. That means it don't matter how big you are. It don't matter how little you are. The only thing that matters is that the Holy Ghost gets a hold of you. Friends, let me tell you, whenever God gets a hold of you and the Holy Ghost gets a hold of you, the same thing that happened to David stone is the same thing that'll happen to you. When the Holy Ghost gets a hold of something, it changes its limitations in this natural world. &gt;&gt; Before the Holy Ghost, you was limited in your worship. You was limited in saying amen. You was limited in coming to church. You was limited in serving God. But when the Holy Ghost got a hold of you, it changed your limitations &gt;&gt; and all of a sudden now I've had people come in church, I I ain't going to raise my hand, but I'll come to church with you. And now, Brother Charles, his hands raised. He just praises God. He don't care to say amen. WHY? BECAUSE THE HOLY GHOST got a hold of him. &gt;&gt; And before HE WAS QUIET, SAID THERE, WELL, YOU KNOW, I APPRECIATE THAT, BUT I'M NOT GOING TO GET INVOLVED LIKE THAT. BUT WHEN SOMETHING GOT A HOLD OF YOU, IT CHANGES THE WAY YOU WORSHIP BECAUSE IT CHANGED YOUR LIMITATION. We're not limited by the gravity, &gt;&gt; the things of this natural world, this three-dimensional world. And we're not limited by it because because the Holy Ghost got a hold of us and it took us into another dimension. &gt;&gt; That's where God brings us when you come in the house of God. That's the atmosphere that's being created in this building. It's an atmosphere in another dimension. And if you could open your eyes and see into that world where the angels of God are encamped about us in another dimension. I thought my but if God a king like David a natural king could have a stone that he could throw that the Holy Ghost could get out in that way then what about the son of David the one that was called son of David that was the king of kings. Oh don't think that he don't have a satchel full of stones too. You can find one bag of them over in Ephesians 4. There was a prophet and a apostle and a teacher, an evangelist and a and a pastor, they're God's stones. And he don't think that the Holy Ghost when he whenever he gets a old giant come into the church that God can't pick one of them stones up and he can he can whoop it out there across the building and the Holy Ghost get a hold of it and he don't even know what he's saying, but the Holy Ghost got a hold of it and goes into another dimension and it'll tear down every giant in your life just like it did in David's life. He ain't the only one that had the stones in his satchel. That's what brother Brown mean you you remember I I ran out of time preaching this. &gt;&gt; You remember when brother Brandham was in the Houston Coliseum and they were debating on divine healing and all that. He said he was sitting up in the balcony and they were up there debating brother best and was saying he didn't believe in all that and all these meetings were fake. And then finally brother Bosworth said, "Well, brother Bam's here in the building somewhere. If he wants to come down and speak, he can. It's up to him. I'm not going to tell you where he is." thousands of people sitting in the building. And brother Bam said, "I was just sitting there." He said, "And something just picked me up." &gt;&gt; I thought, "What was it?" It was a stone. He's a stone in the hand of a king. &gt;&gt; He said, "When it picked me up, what?" It ain't no different than David reaching down there in his satchel. &gt;&gt; But it wasn't a natural king. It was the king of kings. &gt;&gt; He reached way down in his satchel and he picked one up. &gt;&gt; He said, "When he picked me up, he said, I just knew I was to go forward. I thought that's the way it is with us. You know what happened when he walked down there? They took the photo and the in the pillar of fire was present in the picture. I said, "That's the same thing that happens with us. Sometimes you don't feel like saying anything. Sometimes you don't feel like worshiping God. Sometimes you don't feel like raising your hand, but all of a sudden there's something. You don't know why it is, but you're just sitting there in in the presence of God moving around you. And all of a sudden, something just picks you up. Something just lift your hand." Said, "But I know one thing that when he picks you up, I know that I must GO FORWARD. I KNOW I MUST I MUST SAY AMEN.

And what a wonderful God that we serve. But said, "What we need is a Holy Ghost atmosphere, an atmosphere where the power of God's moving in one accord in one place. Gathered together under that atmosphere of expecting God to move down signs [music] and wonders. Let's move oursel up into that bracket. Step up in faith and out of these three dimensions and up into the next one. Amen. I don't believe we have to be bound by the dimensions of this earthly world or the seen things or the challenges of this flesh. We don't have to be bound by those things. That's why Paul said, "We are now living in heavenly places [music] in Christ Jesus." There's another realm, another place that you can live being entertained by angels. Isn't that where the prophet went that day? and the the angels came and entertained and the that God sent birds to feed and that's not a that that's getting into another dimension. Amen. I believe that God is calling the church out of the confines of this natural world into the unlimited power of a new dimension or of another dimension. It's a new reality to the believer. And Paul said it comes by faith. &gt;&gt; Amen. God's given. How many believe that this morning? [music] Amen. You don't have to be confined by it. When that old devil comes around, say, you know what, you old fifth dimension walker, you you I know where you came from, and I know where you're going back to. &gt;&gt; But I ain't going to be bound by that. &gt;&gt; There's another dimensions even higher than that. &gt;&gt; It's not a far off. It's just like walking through a door right in the world that you live in. Amen. And I just say invite the presence of God into our life. Amen. Let's just bow our heads. Gracious heavenly father. Lord, we thank you Lord for your spirit here this morning. God, that's a desire that we have as believers, Lord. And God, to be able to move out of this world and the pressures and things of this life, Lord. That's the the great thing of of serving you, Lord, is God that you've lifted us up above those things, Lord. So many times through the scripture, Lord, that we could find and God to bring the church up or to lift her up into a higher power, Lord, into a place of victory. Lord, we realize that our victory lies in that dimension. God, it don't lie in our things that we accomplish, our accomp accomplishments in this flesh, but Lord, it's a spiritual accomplishment, Lord. God, it comes from surrendering to your will and entering into a heavenly atmosphere. Lord, I pray for the church this morning, God. I just pray Lord that that desire would be on every heart God that the very thing that's within them Lord the deep that calls to the deep God it would be drawn into that atmosphere Lord and God that we'd just be caught in the middle Lord in the in the middle of a responding to a call Lord may our natural life Lord just be caught up in the middle of it all Lord God and just reflect the the heavenly move in our life God I pray you'd go with each one as we go from this place Lord let the revival of God burn in their heart. Lord, that we would come back into this building on Wednesday night. Lord, just come back under the spirit of worship and spirit of expectation. God, we just pray you'd keep your hand upon each one as we go from this place. Those that are traveling, Lord, on their vacations, Lord, I pray you'd bring them home safely. [music] We ask these things in Jesus name. Amen. Amen. God bless you this morning as you go. My anchor holds [singing] when the ship is battered. My anchor holds &gt;&gt; even when [singing] I say many times [singing] &gt;&gt; I've fallen on my knees &gt;&gt; when I face the raging seas. But I had an anchor &gt;&gt; that still holds. &gt;&gt; In spite of a storm, I say [singing] my anor still holds. Even when my sheep [singing] is batter. Yes, my anchor holds even when the sails are torn. I have fallen on my knees. [singing] As I face [music] the raging sea, the anchor holds [music] in spite of the storm. &gt;&gt; [music] &gt;&gt; Yes, my anor even when my ship is better [singing] or my anchor hold though my [singing] sails are torn. I have fallen on my knees as I face a [music] raging [singing] sea. The anchor holds in spite of [music] the storm.
