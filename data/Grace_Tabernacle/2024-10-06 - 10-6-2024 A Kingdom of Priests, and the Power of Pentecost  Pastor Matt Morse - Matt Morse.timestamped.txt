[45:30] scriptures to the Book of Exodus and
[45:32] we're going to read out of the 19th
[45:34] Chapter and we'll start right in the
[45:36] first verse Exodus 19 and one when you
[45:39] get there just say Amen just give you a
[45:42] moment to find that scripture sure
[45:45] appreciate our singers this morning and
[45:48] my there there's nothing like some
[45:50] anointed singers that go before the word
[45:52] and make preparation amen and amen so we
[45:55] just want to read Exodus the 19th
[45:58] Chapter and we'll read out of the first
[46:00] verse the Bible says in the third month
[46:03] when the children of Israel were gone
[46:04] forth out of the land of Egypt the same
[46:07] day came they Into the Wilderness of Si
[46:11] for they were departed from ridum and
[46:13] were come to the desert of Si and had
[46:16] pitched in the wilderness and there
[46:18] Israel camped before the mountain and
[46:20] Moses went up unto God and the Lord
[46:22] called him out of the mountain saying
[46:24] thus shall thou say to the house of
[46:26] Jacob and tell the children of Israel
[46:28] you have seen what I did unto the
[46:30] Egyptians and how I bear You On Eagle's
[46:32] Wings and brought you unto myself now
[46:35] therefore if you will obey my voice
[46:37] indeed and keep my Covenant then you
[46:39] shall be a peculiar treasure unto me
[46:42] above all people and all the Earth for
[46:44] all the Earth is mine and you shall be
[46:46] unto me a kingdom of priests and a holy
[46:49] nation these are the words which Thou
[46:51] shalt speak unto the children of Israel
[46:54] and I'd like to speak this morning as
[46:56] you take your seats I'm going to speak
[46:58] on a kingdom of priests and the power of
[47:02] Pentecost and I also want to read out of
[47:05] the book of uh acts the 2 chapter and
[47:08] and as you're seated in the first verse
[47:10] second chapter in the first verse the
[47:13] Bible says and when the day of Pentecost
[47:15] was fully come they were all with one
[47:16] Accord and in one place and suddenly
[47:19] there came a sound from Heaven as a
[47:21] rushing Mighty Wind and it filled all
[47:23] the house where they were sitting and
[47:25] there appeared unto them clothing
[47:27] tongues like as of fire and it set upon
[47:29] each of them and they were all filled
[47:31] with the Holy Ghost and they began to
[47:33] speak with other tongues as the spirit
[47:36] gave them utterance now I want to speak
[47:38] this morning use these two scriptures
[47:39] the kingdom of priests and the power of
[47:42] Pentecost of course we know this word uh
[47:44] Pentecost brother Bobby is a uh is a
[47:47] word that we're very how many's familiar
[47:48] with the word Pentecost I said how
[47:50] many's familiar with the word Pentecost
[47:52] just make sure we we all we all get
[47:54] caught on here this morning so I'm going
[47:56] to go really fast so if y'all can just
[47:57] help me just to be able to get to where
[48:00] I want to get to this morning uh the
[48:02] Lord willing so uh this word Pentecost
[48:05] of course we realize that this is used
[48:06] by many churches and organizations
[48:08] around the world and uh certainly that
[48:11] there's many that would use this title
[48:12] they call we call uh theirselves
[48:14] Pentecostals and uh but you know I
[48:17] believe this this morning that any any
[48:19] good God called Pentecostal preacher
[48:21] would tell you that uh just because you
[48:23] call yourself Pentecostal doesn't mean
[48:25] that you've ever been to Pentecost it uh
[48:27] it's just a name that a lot of people
[48:29] use but but I want to show this morning
[48:31] um that that where this word had
[48:33] actually came from and we realized that
[48:35] uh that the name Pentecost was actually
[48:37] a part of the Jewish feast that was
[48:39] celebrated at the end of the first
[48:42] harvest and you realized that in the in
[48:44] the uh the feast that the Jews take part
[48:46] of these are pilgrimage feasts in other
[48:48] words uh when God had told Moses
[48:50] there'll be a time that you all come
[48:51] back to Jerusalem or come back uh come
[48:54] back to worship here so these are
[48:55] pilgrimage feasts there three uh major
[48:58] pilgrimage feasts one of them was the
[48:59] Feast of unleaving bread or or we would
[49:01] call it the Passover the other was the
[49:03] Feast of Weeks which we call Pentecost
[49:05] and the other uh the Feast of booths or
[49:07] or or be looked as the Christians would
[49:10] call it the Feast of Tabernacles but uh
[49:12] we realize that each one of these feasts
[49:14] they were they were they were uh uh made
[49:16] after a real event that took place in
[49:18] The Exodus in The Exodus journey of the
[49:20] journey from Egypt unto unto the
[49:23] promised land and so I want to look this
[49:25] morning at this middle one at the at
[49:27] this word Pentecost and and we we see
[49:29] that that Pentecost which which was in
[49:31] the Jews the Feast of Weeks it came uh
[49:34] it came after they had left out of the
[49:36] Passover remember whenever the when the
[49:38] angel of the Lord came and the death
[49:40] angel came and they put the blood up
[49:41] their doors to leave out of Egypt and
[49:43] then they went the Bible says in the
[49:45] third month they came to the Mount Si in
[49:47] other words so uh they they came to this
[49:49] place of of worship but their their time
[49:53] from from from uh coming out of the
[49:55] Passover to mount sign and I uh it took
[49:58] 50 days so the name Pentecost actually
[50:00] thank you brother Tim the name Pentecost
[50:02] actually means 50th so that's where the
[50:04] name had came from and so we see that 50
[50:07] days after they came out of Egypt and
[50:09] away from the Passover and then they
[50:11] made their way over to Mount Si brother
[50:13] bham also would make this connection he
[50:15] said you'll notice that 50 is also the
[50:17] amount of years that it took in order
[50:19] for the Jubilee to come remember when a
[50:21] person would go into bondage or maybe
[50:22] they would get into debt or they would
[50:24] lose their family or go into slavery and
[50:26] be so into a slavery that every 50th
[50:29] year that God had made a place that they
[50:31] would be able to receive all of their
[50:33] stuff back they would be able to get out
[50:34] of bondage and have Liberty isn't it
[50:36] something that God would never allow his
[50:38] children to always remain in bondage I
[50:40] thought it was wonderful that he he
[50:42] would make a time and brother BR would
[50:43] take this and show that in that 50th
[50:45] year in the time of Jubilee He said see
[50:47] it was the same as Pentecost it brought
[50:49] Liberty to the church it brought
[50:51] whenever you got to this place that the
[50:53] bondage that you were under couldn't
[50:54] hold you any longer so but it didn't
[50:56] matter what was owed or what what debt
[50:58] was owed or how far how far how bad it
[51:01] was brother Jared but whenever you came
[51:02] to that year uh all was made whole again
[51:05] so we see as as Believers today as
[51:08] Christian Believers we remember we
[51:10] remember the name Pentecost as the day
[51:12] that the Holy Ghost fell in the book of
[51:13] Acts how many know that we that that's
[51:15] what whenever you say Pentecost that's
[51:17] what we think of what happened in Acts
[51:18] the 2 chapter it was the the day that
[51:21] the Holy Ghost invaded the church and it
[51:23] brought the it brought the power of God
[51:25] back to the church again it brought
[51:26] power back to the body of Believers and
[51:28] power back to the church but but we
[51:30] realize that that that that power is not
[51:33] the only thing that Pentecost brought to
[51:35] the church it wasn't uh that wasn't the
[51:37] only thing that that entered into the
[51:38] church but actually Pentecost also
[51:41] brought a time of Holiness to God's
[51:43] people and I I I think whenever God
[51:45] would speak of the what the day of
[51:47] Pentecost would be you can read this in
[51:48] numbers the 28th chapter the Bible said
[51:51] in the 26th verse it said also in the
[51:53] day of the first fruits when you bring a
[51:56] new meat offering unto the Lord after
[51:58] your weeks be out you shall have a holy
[52:00] convocation now now notice after your
[52:02] weeks be out remember this time of
[52:04] Pentecost it was seven weeks of seven
[52:07] days so that's 49 days and then on the
[52:09] following day was the 50th day which
[52:11] made it a Pentecost so so here the Lord
[52:13] says after your weeks be out the day he
[52:16] said you shall have a holy convocation
[52:18] and you shall do no survi work then so
[52:21] here whenever God's talking about this
[52:23] Pentecost time whenever the day of
[52:25] Pentecost would come it would be a day
[52:27] of holy convocation in other words you'd
[52:29] read this where where where in
[52:31] translated where we can understand it it
[52:33] was a holy convocation was a convocation
[52:36] of Holiness in other words it was a
[52:37] declaration of Holiness it was a it was
[52:40] a call to Holiness so when God tells
[52:42] them he said but after your weeks be out
[52:44] and on this day of Pentecost when this
[52:46] day would come it it is a call of the
[52:49] church to come to a place of Holiness
[52:51] that's why that's why when you see
[52:52] Pentecost and Holiness together that's
[52:54] where it come from it was a call to H it
[52:56] was a call of God to call the church
[52:58] back to this place of Holiness so you
[53:00] say well brother Matt why would
[53:01] Pentecost be a call to Holiness well
[53:04] you'd have to see what happened during
[53:06] that time see the first the first
[53:08] Pentecost that we see it didn't happen
[53:09] in the book of Acts in the second
[53:11] chapter but the first Pentecost the real
[53:13] event that happened that the feast was
[53:15] made after that that that time way back
[53:17] in in in the The Book of Exodus on Mount
[53:20] Si remember it was 50 days after they
[53:22] came out of the Passover they come to
[53:24] Mount Si this is actually the first time
[53:27] this is where Pentecost was uh was
[53:30] started this is what the feast was to to
[53:32] commemorate was this moment standing on
[53:34] the base of Mount Si when they came to
[53:36] this place here's what God said to Moses
[53:38] he said You shall be unto me a kingdom
[53:41] of priests and be a holy nation and then
[53:44] Moses goes on and he begins to tell the
[53:46] people that we're coming to a place
[53:48] where we're going to be in the presence
[53:49] of God he's about to take them and allow
[53:52] them to hear the voice of God he's he's
[53:54] going to take them to the base of the
[53:55] mountain and the presence of the the
[53:56] Lord is going to come and he's going to
[53:58] have communion with the people and Moses
[54:00] says but before we can ever get to that
[54:02] place there's something that has to be
[54:04] done it's a call of God to sanctify
[54:06] yourself and Moses begins to instruct
[54:08] the church he said you got to clean up
[54:10] the church you got to you got to wash
[54:11] all the clothes you got to clean
[54:13] yourselves you got to take the filthy
[54:15] thoughts and things out of your mind and
[54:16] you when you come in the presence of God
[54:19] you can't have all of that and be able
[54:20] to stand in the presence of God so here
[54:23] this time of Pentecost it was a call of
[54:25] Holiness Moses said clean up yourselves
[54:27] get get ready and get prepared and and
[54:29] get your life and your mind right and
[54:31] get your mind on the things of God that
[54:33] we can go to the base of the mountain
[54:35] that God could come and have communion
[54:37] with the church and the Bible said and
[54:39] Moses brought them forth he brought the
[54:41] people out of the camp to meet with God
[54:44] and they stood at the foot of the
[54:45] mountain and mount SI was all together
[54:48] the Bible said in Mount Si it was all
[54:50] together on a smoke because the Lord
[54:52] descended upon it in Fire and the smoke
[54:55] ascended as the smoke of a furnace and
[54:57] the whole Mountain Quake greatly see
[54:59] friends a real Pentecostal experience is
[55:02] to be in the presence of God here's what
[55:04] Moses is showing the church if you want
[55:06] a real Pentecostal experience you got to
[55:08] clean your life up and you got to let
[55:10] all these things go and sanctify
[55:12] yourself and then come with me and let's
[55:14] step into the presence of God and have a
[55:16] real Pentecostal experience with God see
[55:18] the Pentecostal experience it was a
[55:20] pillar of fire it was a it was the fire
[55:22] of God that came down on Mount Si that
[55:25] day and consumed the the very lives of
[55:27] people I think isn't it isn't it
[55:28] something to be able to have an
[55:30] experience that way brother M said like
[55:31] this he said why would you want to be
[55:34] halfway what's the use of being a
[55:36] lukewarm Church hello somebody he said
[55:39] either be red hot or be ice cold and
[55:41] don't claim Pentecost unless you're
[55:43] going to live Pentecost there ain't no
[55:45] needing jumping any higher than you live
[55:47] because it ain't the bootleg joints
[55:49] that's causing the that's hurting the
[55:51] unbeliever it ain't the it ain't the
[55:53] bars that hurts the unbeliever it ain't
[55:55] all the the f places in the world in the
[55:57] whiskey store that hurts the unbeliever
[55:59] he said it's the people that claim to
[56:01] have something and still act like the
[56:03] world that's the real stumbling bought
[56:05] to the unbeliever but I thank God that
[56:08] God has called us to a real Pentecost I
[56:10] thank God that he's called us to this
[56:12] place of Holiness and to a place of
[56:14] sanctification but remember said
[56:16] Pentecost it is your possession so even
[56:18] if you don't feel like it's something
[56:20] that you can have or something that you
[56:21] can achieve here's a promise from a
[56:23] prophet of God he said Pentecost is your
[56:25] possession it it belongs to you it it
[56:28] belongs to you he said the Pentecostal
[56:30] experience is your possession you know
[56:32] what that tells me brother Jared that
[56:33] every person young or old every man
[56:36] every woman and child has a right to a
[56:38] real Pentecostal experience how many
[56:40] believe that he said it's your
[56:42] possession now notice in the Old
[56:44] Testament all the things that happened
[56:46] in the Old Testament brother remember
[56:47] would go through he said look what they
[56:49] did when they walked before God they
[56:51] escape the edge of a sword they come out
[56:52] of fiery furnaces they they they they
[56:55] they escape lies Den everything that
[56:57] they done in the Old Testament he said
[56:59] it was just a shadow of that real
[57:01] Pentecost it was a shadow of what God
[57:04] could really do or don't you see Church
[57:05] it ain't something that God was greater
[57:07] back in the old days it wasn't God was
[57:09] greater when he could take somebody out
[57:10] of a Li's Den or or bring somebody
[57:12] through a fire but the prophet of God
[57:14] said that was the shadow of the reality
[57:16] of what God's going to do in this age
[57:18] friends it and it's our possession it
[57:20] belongs to us it's what we it's what we
[57:22] attain uh brother Weser we strive in
[57:24] order to be able to attain it or to
[57:26] achieve it but you notice he says see
[57:28] the the this real Pentecost that was a
[57:30] shadow of Pentecost but what happened in
[57:32] the book of Acts this is what God was
[57:33] trying to bring to the church this is a
[57:36] a real Pentecostal experience bringing
[57:38] it to the church we realize that this is
[57:40] what the church had need of how many
[57:41] believe that the church needs something
[57:43] that can sustain the church do you
[57:45] believe it you you have to have
[57:47] something that could sustain it because
[57:48] the church is going to go through 2,000
[57:50] years and all these ages and all these
[57:53] great trials and and Through the Dark
[57:54] Ages and all these things that the
[57:56] church would have to go through through
[57:57] these through these years these great
[57:59] many battles so we have to have
[58:00] something that could sustain the church
[58:03] through all of that time even David
[58:05] would write he said cast your burden on
[58:07] the Lord he said he shall sustain thee
[58:09] it meant something to David to be
[58:11] sustained he said my God is my portion
[58:14] it meant something to have something
[58:15] that could sustain you he said he's my
[58:17] portion he's my satisfying portion he
[58:20] he's something that I can hold on to he
[58:22] it's something that that can help me
[58:23] through the next day he's something that
[58:25] can help me through my trial he's
[58:27] something that can help me through the
[58:28] battle he's my satisfying portion and he
[58:31] can sustain me see David being a king of
[58:33] Israel no doubt David knew knew what it
[58:36] meant to have a God that was a sustainer
[58:39] he knew what it meant to have something
[58:41] that could sustain you it it wasn't just
[58:43] a few years after they had became a
[58:45] nation that David just a few Generations
[58:48] that he had became the king over Israel
[58:50] but David being a king no doubt he knew
[58:52] the history of the Kingdom hello and
[58:54] because he knew the history of the
[58:56] Kingdom he knew that God had always been
[58:58] a sustainer to his children oh I could
[59:00] just see David you know young boys many
[59:03] young boys that he raised and you you
[59:05] going to see little Solomon coming up
[59:06] there Oh Daddy you know I heard that one
[59:08] of the tutors that was telling me about
[59:10] our ancestors and how they came out of
[59:12] Egypt and and and when they come out
[59:14] there was this Mana that fell from
[59:16] heaven and and and and they always got
[59:18] fed throughout the day daddy what's that
[59:20] story all about I just see David turning
[59:22] to him say Well Solomon let me just tell
[59:24] you son God when God has always been a
[59:27] sustainer can I ask you like this
[59:29] Solomon but when you come to the table
[59:31] is there not always food at the table
[59:33] yeah Daddy there's always food at the
[59:34] table why why do you come to the table
[59:36] Solomon well I come to eat have you ever
[59:39] do you know where the food comes from
[59:40] well Daddy I never really thought about
[59:42] it but every time I sit down at the
[59:44] table there's always plenty of food have
[59:45] you ever went hungry Solomon no Daddy
[59:48] I've never went hungry you know why
[59:49] because he lived in the house of a king
[59:51] and the table was always full and when I
[59:54] come to the table and there's something
[59:55] that that will take care of me there's a
[59:57] sustainer there's a sustenance there's
[59:59] food that I can feed on it gives
[1:00:01] strength to my body it brings joy to my
[1:00:03] soul it's things that I enjoy eating and
[1:00:05] feeding on he said Solomon see that's
[1:00:07] the way it is with God it's just like
[1:00:09] you being a young man having an Earthly
[1:00:11] father that would put food on the table
[1:00:13] and make sure you had something to
[1:00:14] sustain you that's the way that God done
[1:00:17] with his children when they came out of
[1:00:19] Egypt and they had no food in their
[1:00:20] belly and they couldn't go another day
[1:00:22] and they got to murmur into God saying
[1:00:24] God I'm hungry for something son let me
[1:00:26] tell you what God done he rained Mana
[1:00:29] out of heaven and they walked out of
[1:00:30] their tents and upon the ground was food
[1:00:33] that came from God it wasn't there the
[1:00:35] night before the worms and things had
[1:00:37] eat it all up but when it came out of
[1:00:39] Heaven There was food and they fed it
[1:00:40] from the time they left out of Egypt
[1:00:42] till the time they entered into the
[1:00:44] promised land the Bible said they ate
[1:00:46] fresh Mana every day see that's what our
[1:00:49] heavenly father has done he gave them
[1:00:51] something that would sustain him see
[1:00:53] they had no place to settle down a place
[1:00:55] to grow crops but but but but he would
[1:00:57] sustain them make sure that they had
[1:00:58] something to eat and think think when
[1:01:00] they come out the very first time that
[1:01:03] it fell listen what happened the first
[1:01:05] time that Mana fell in the wilderness
[1:01:07] the Bible says and they picked it up the
[1:01:09] priest and put an armful and kept it and
[1:01:11] reserved it for the priesthood God told
[1:01:13] him to go put it in the holies of holies
[1:01:15] this will be kept and throughout
[1:01:16] throughout all the ages every day that
[1:01:18] it would go bad that'd come out and
[1:01:20] they'd eat a little bit the next morning
[1:01:21] they'd had to have fresh Mana they'd eat
[1:01:23] a little bit the next morning they'd had
[1:01:25] to have fresh Mana this is what God was
[1:01:26] doing he was making the church depend on
[1:01:28] him he wasn't letting them go build up
[1:01:30] this is the way people like to go to
[1:01:31] church people like well just have church
[1:01:33] on Sunday and they don't have nothing to
[1:01:35] do with God for the rest of the week and
[1:01:36] we come back next Sunday and try to
[1:01:38] start all over again it's like this week
[1:01:40] toe relationship that people have with
[1:01:42] God but God put but he wouldn't allow
[1:01:44] them just to have something that would
[1:01:45] just go week to week he wanted to give
[1:01:47] them something that they could feed on
[1:01:48] every day and every morning they had to
[1:01:50] get up and go out and they had gather
[1:01:52] the food that God had prepared for I
[1:01:54] thank God that he put something out that
[1:01:56] we don't have to wait a week or week
[1:01:58] down the road or next weekend in order
[1:02:00] to be able to to be sustained but God
[1:02:02] gives us something every day that we can
[1:02:04] feed upon the word of God and they went
[1:02:06] out and they trust to the Lord they
[1:02:08] couldn't build it up that's what we want
[1:02:09] to do we want to build all all up so we
[1:02:11] can depend on oursel that's way we do
[1:02:13] with our money that's way that's way we
[1:02:15] we want to build everything up in case
[1:02:16] something goes bad and that's all good
[1:02:18] but God wants us to depend upon him he
[1:02:21] wants us daily to depend on him and they
[1:02:24] went out every morning and they gathered
[1:02:25] but but but in the holies of holies
[1:02:27] there was a basket full that was kept
[1:02:29] but says see when you come into this
[1:02:31] land this is what this is what the Bible
[1:02:32] said when you come into this land I want
[1:02:34] this om of of meal to be kept in this
[1:02:37] holy place that from now on that every
[1:02:40] priest that ever comes into the
[1:02:41] priesthood that he once he would come to
[1:02:43] this holy place after he was ordained to
[1:02:45] be a priest that he had a right to go in
[1:02:47] and take a mouthful of that original
[1:02:49] Mana original Mana that fell at the
[1:02:52] beginning and so here here here God
[1:02:54] would would would put this us up so that
[1:02:57] generation after generation that every
[1:03:00] priest would be able to taste of that
[1:03:01] original manner isn't that something it
[1:03:03] wasn't just a hand me down or something
[1:03:05] that you would pass down one from
[1:03:07] another but God put the original in
[1:03:09] there that when the priest it may have
[1:03:10] been a hundred years later but when a
[1:03:12] priest was ordained to the priesthood
[1:03:14] maybe he had been longing for it and
[1:03:15] thinking about it and his mind was on it
[1:03:17] my I wonder what it was like back then
[1:03:19] in the days uh when they come across the
[1:03:21] Wilderness and they ate that Mana from
[1:03:22] Heaven that that little sweet flavor
[1:03:24] that God had given them it was created
[1:03:26] by God I wonder what was like well
[1:03:28] you're ordained to be a priest and so so
[1:03:30] look what you have access to the holies
[1:03:31] of holies and that priest could walk in
[1:03:34] and take out of that little vessel a
[1:03:36] piece of that or or a little taste of
[1:03:37] that and put it in his mouth and taste
[1:03:39] the same thing that they tasted the very
[1:03:41] first day they were on Mount Si my isn't
[1:03:44] it something the first time you eat it
[1:03:45] it's always the best you go to a new eat
[1:03:48] a new steak it's always the best the
[1:03:50] first time now that was the best I ever
[1:03:51] ate but then after a little while
[1:03:53] sometimes it grows common to you hello
[1:03:56] sometimes you know you hear the same
[1:03:57] thing over and over and it grows common
[1:03:59] to you but hear what God Said but I'm
[1:04:01] going to put it in a place that's
[1:04:02] anointed I'm going to put it in an
[1:04:04] anointed place that you can come to in a
[1:04:07] 50 years down the road and you can go in
[1:04:09] there and you can take it and eat of it
[1:04:11] and when you feed on it you'll taste
[1:04:13] just like it did that very first day I
[1:04:15] thank God we ain't eating leftovers we a
[1:04:18] we ain't eating something that's lost
[1:04:19] its flavor it ain't lost its Savor in
[1:04:21] the mouth of the believer but I thank
[1:04:23] God we have something that still got the
[1:04:25] same power in it that God put in the
[1:04:27] beginning to see the priest could go in
[1:04:30] they could feed on it so why why you
[1:04:32] said see they could eat it said well
[1:04:34] what type do we have today said this is
[1:04:36] what this is what this means to us but M
[1:04:38] said you are a royal priesthood you're a
[1:04:41] holy nation You're A peculiar people
[1:04:44] making spiritual sacrifices unto God the
[1:04:46] fruit of your lips giving thanks to his
[1:04:48] name you are a royal priesthood so see
[1:04:51] we realize he said now then on the day
[1:04:53] of Pentecost when the Holy Spirit was
[1:04:55] calling that was our mana and so every
[1:04:59] priest back there under the Old
[1:05:00] Testament they could come back and be a
[1:05:01] priest they knew they was going to get a
[1:05:03] mouth full of the original not some
[1:05:04] manmade way to look at it but they was
[1:05:06] going to get some of the original said
[1:05:09] see on the day of Pentecost when our
[1:05:11] Mana Begin to Fall my a't that good on
[1:05:13] the day of Pentecost our Mana Begin to
[1:05:15] Fall the Holy Ghost came in like a
[1:05:18] Russian Mighty W wind and here was a
[1:05:20] bunch of little dignified people in an
[1:05:21] upper room with the door shut but they
[1:05:23] were waiting on the promise of God and
[1:05:26] when the promise of God came they fed
[1:05:28] upon that Mana brother Wesley day after
[1:05:30] day they fed upon it and I thank God he
[1:05:32] said but I'm going to put it up in a
[1:05:34] place that you can have access to it in
[1:05:37] 2024 and I thank God we ain't got to go
[1:05:39] by 2,000 years ago in order to find that
[1:05:42] Mana but I but it's right here this
[1:05:44] morning the very same thing that the
[1:05:46] church fed on in the book of Acts is the
[1:05:48] same thing that the church has access to
[1:05:50] this morning he said that's what we want
[1:05:52] tonight if this little group of people
[1:05:54] could ever get in one Accord like like
[1:05:55] they was on that night the same thing
[1:05:57] would repeat tonight right here in this
[1:05:59] building you say why because he's still
[1:06:02] a sustainer he's still our satisfying
[1:06:05] portion in other words the Holy Ghost
[1:06:07] Mana that begin to fall on the day of
[1:06:10] Pentecost he said it was sent there to
[1:06:12] sustain the church and the church was to
[1:06:15] live only by the Holy Spirit until the
[1:06:17] day we enter into the
[1:06:19] Millennium ain't that wonderful that God
[1:06:21] would give us something to feed upon the
[1:06:23] holy spirit until the day that we enter
[1:06:25] into the Millennium that's what God has
[1:06:27] sent to the church see there's something
[1:06:30] about the fire of God last week we were
[1:06:31] talking about the Earth being baptized
[1:06:33] by fire and how that it took fire to
[1:06:36] come and cleanse the Earth from sin and
[1:06:38] from sickness and disease and germs and
[1:06:40] and Peril but said it would cleanse it
[1:06:42] from everything the Sinners the devil
[1:06:44] and all his group would be included he'd
[1:06:46] be cast into the Lake of Fire but that
[1:06:48] Holy Fire from God it comes down from
[1:06:50] God out of heaven and it burns it up to
[1:06:52] make it ready for God to dwell in for
[1:06:55] God in the new world that is to come is
[1:06:57] to dwell in the earth he said see
[1:06:59] because God dwells in the human heart
[1:07:02] but he and the bride become one and they
[1:07:04] go to their new home in the new world
[1:07:07] and that same Plan of Redemption that is
[1:07:09] used to redeem the Earth is the same
[1:07:12] Plan of Redemption that is used to
[1:07:14] redeem the people that are in the earth
[1:07:16] so if God is going to clean the Earth
[1:07:17] that way then that's the way he cleans
[1:07:19] every heart he DW before before God
[1:07:21] would dwell in a place it would have to
[1:07:23] be Sanctified it would have to be a
[1:07:24] cleansed place he say see before he
[1:07:26] could dwell in it it has to be a
[1:07:27] repented heart so the heart is repented
[1:07:29] it's baptized with water the in the name
[1:07:31] of Jesus Christ it's cleansed by the
[1:07:33] blood by accepting the sacrifice through
[1:07:35] our faith he said then the Holy Fire of
[1:07:37] the Holy Ghost from God it comes down
[1:07:39] and it burns all of the desire of sin
[1:07:42] and the nature of the world out of our
[1:07:44] life hello somebody is't that wonderful
[1:07:46] to think that the fire of God could come
[1:07:48] into the life of a human being and burn
[1:07:50] the desire of sin right out of our life
[1:07:53] and then when the desire is gone that's
[1:07:55] why the Bible would say that there it is
[1:07:57] impossible for a man that is born of God
[1:08:00] to commit sin right because the desire
[1:08:02] of sin has been burned out of their life
[1:08:04] said there's nothing in him in order to
[1:08:06] commit sin because the desire is burned
[1:08:09] out you see so how how can we be a
[1:08:10] sinner and be redeemed at the same time
[1:08:14] you remember the the story of the little
[1:08:15] boy that that went out and made himself
[1:08:17] a sailboat he went and he built it and
[1:08:20] done all the work and made it so pretty
[1:08:22] where it would sell then he went out
[1:08:24] into the Stream but David he he put it
[1:08:26] in the water and little little Storm
[1:08:29] come up and winds got to blow the stream
[1:08:31] got to moving fast and the little
[1:08:32] sailboat got away from him as it went
[1:08:35] down the stream he watched as he ran
[1:08:37] after it and couldn't get didn't had no
[1:08:39] access to it and down the stream it went
[1:08:41] disappeared off into that Big River few
[1:08:44] days later weeks down the road little
[1:08:46] boy he was walking in town he walked by
[1:08:48] a pawn shop he looked up in the pawn
[1:08:51] shop and there was that little sailboat
[1:08:53] that he had made you know the pawn shop
[1:08:55] owner you know somebody had gone out
[1:08:57] through there and they' found it took it
[1:08:59] to him and he he thought well I can make
[1:09:00] some profit off of this so he took it
[1:09:02] and he set it in a shop that little boy
[1:09:04] went in there said you know that that
[1:09:06] sailboat I there was something something
[1:09:08] about it I I made that I put my I put my
[1:09:11] time I put my effort I I made it with my
[1:09:13] own hands and he and he wanted it so bad
[1:09:15] but you realize the pawn shop owner see
[1:09:17] he had rights to it because it was in
[1:09:19] his shop and he had found it and it
[1:09:20] didn't have no identifying marks it
[1:09:22] didn't have no no way to be able to tie
[1:09:24] it to somebody else it was it was
[1:09:26] something that he had he had grasped and
[1:09:28] took a hold of and and and he had legal
[1:09:29] rights to be able to keep that sailo but
[1:09:32] he put it on the shelf so the little boy
[1:09:33] said well how much do you want for it
[1:09:35] you know I you know maybe maybe a couple
[1:09:37] dollars and so the little boy went home
[1:09:39] and he be to work and he done all the
[1:09:41] chores and everything he could do to
[1:09:42] save up all the the money that he could
[1:09:44] save up and he went back down to the
[1:09:46] pawn shop and he said you know I can't
[1:09:49] have it he said how much for the SBO man
[1:09:51] said it'll be $2 and he laid all his
[1:09:53] little coins on the desk and said I want
[1:09:55] toy by that but by that sailboat and the
[1:09:57] pawn chop owner took it and he put it
[1:09:58] back in his hands and the little boy as
[1:10:00] he goes out of the pawn chop and he's
[1:10:02] holding on to it and he and he looks at
[1:10:04] it he says you know little sailboat I'm
[1:10:06] the one that made you little sailboat
[1:10:08] I'm the one that lost you he said but
[1:10:10] little Sabo I bought you back now you're
[1:10:12] twice mine cuz I made you and I bought
[1:10:15] you I lost you but I redeemed you that's
[1:10:18] what happened between us and God he's
[1:10:20] our creator he made us he formed us from
[1:10:22] his own hands and in the the the the the
[1:10:25] the the storms of this world and the and
[1:10:27] the storms of Satan has took us out of
[1:10:29] the hands of God but he said they're
[1:10:31] still mine he came down and he paid the
[1:10:33] price on the cross of Calvary and he
[1:10:35] redeemed us back to himself he said I
[1:10:38] made you I formed you I lost you but I
[1:10:41] bought you back I've redeemed you and
[1:10:43] now you're twice mine we belong to God
[1:10:46] you see how can we be how can we belong
[1:10:49] to the to the world and belong to God
[1:10:51] that sailboat it didn't belong to the
[1:10:53] pawn shop owner any longer he had no to
[1:10:55] it anymore cuz a little boy had a
[1:10:57] receipt in his hand he said he may have
[1:10:59] found it he may have had a right to it
[1:11:01] he may have had a claim on it but I got
[1:11:02] a receipt where the debt was paid see
[1:11:04] you can't be a sinner and be redeemed at
[1:11:06] the same time you're either lost or
[1:11:08] you're saved you can't be both you can't
[1:11:10] still be you can't still be bound and
[1:11:12] still be lost in sin and been redeemed
[1:11:15] by God you're either a sinner or you're
[1:11:17] redeemed so see when God redeems you you
[1:11:20] belong to him there ain't no going back
[1:11:22] the devil ain't got no rights he lost
[1:11:24] all of his rights when he redeemed you
[1:11:27] he lost his rights to you said see he
[1:11:29] redeemed Us by his blood and by his
[1:11:31] Spirit he cleanses the church and he
[1:11:33] comes to dwell in US you say who is this
[1:11:36] church that God is going to dwell in
[1:11:38] well you notice when Moses was leading
[1:11:40] them out of Israel the Bible says that
[1:11:42] they were the people of God as long as
[1:11:44] they were in bondage they remained the
[1:11:46] people of God but the Bible said and you
[1:11:49] can you can you can read when they were
[1:11:51] called out by God Stephen preaches a a
[1:11:53] fine message in Acts the seventh chapter
[1:11:54] on it he said whenever they were called
[1:11:56] out by God step calls them he said that
[1:11:59] God took them out this was Moses that
[1:12:00] was with them it was Moses that was in
[1:12:03] the church in the wilderness so Stephen
[1:12:05] says see no longer was it a people of
[1:12:07] God but it was a Church of God said he
[1:12:09] said it was a church in the wilderness
[1:12:10] it wasn't a Wilderness people it was a
[1:12:12] Wilderness Church see there so there's
[1:12:15] what the church is is the church is a
[1:12:16] called out people but said see that's
[1:12:19] what that's what we are we're called out
[1:12:20] of God we're the PE they were the people
[1:12:22] of God but we became the Church of God
[1:12:24] because we were called out and that's
[1:12:26] the same thing that has happened to the
[1:12:27] believer today when God calls you out
[1:12:30] you become a part of the church think
[1:12:31] about that's what the church is it's the
[1:12:33] called out you say well what are we
[1:12:34] called out of we're called out of
[1:12:36] everything that's in this world we're
[1:12:38] called out of every religious cult every
[1:12:40] denomination every organization every
[1:12:43] all the thoughts of man we've been
[1:12:44] called out we've been called out of the
[1:12:46] bondage of Le oosa we've been called out
[1:12:48] of sin we've been called out by the
[1:12:50] message of the hour to a place that God
[1:12:53] can have communion with his church we're
[1:12:55] the called out of God we're the Church
[1:12:57] of the Living God see the church is the
[1:12:59] called out but you know whenever the
[1:13:00] Call Comes many refuse the call of
[1:13:04] God many refuse the call of God just
[1:13:07] like they did in the days of Moses this
[1:13:08] isn't a new thing Stephen said Moses was
[1:13:12] refused by the people still yet he was
[1:13:14] sent by God he was refused they would
[1:13:18] make statements and say who made you the
[1:13:20] ruler or the judge over us Moses after
[1:13:23] all you're just a man who made made you
[1:13:25] the judge over the people to be able to
[1:13:27] speak a voice this is what this is what
[1:13:28] Steven said they who made you the ruler
[1:13:31] he said but the same God sent him to be
[1:13:33] the ruler and the deliverer by the hand
[1:13:35] of the Angel which appeared unto him in
[1:13:37] the bush man ain't that good it wasn't
[1:13:40] the hand of Moses that delivered him
[1:13:41] from bondage it wasn't his own it wasn't
[1:13:43] Moses's staff that delivered him from
[1:13:45] bondage it wasn't Moses's power that
[1:13:47] delivered him from bondage but the Bible
[1:13:49] said it was the angel that appeared unto
[1:13:52] him in the burning bush and the Hand of
[1:13:54] that angel that appeared under the
[1:13:56] prophet the hand of the angel that gave
[1:13:58] him his commission by the hand of the
[1:14:00] Angel was the people delivered by the
[1:14:02] hand of the Angel was the power of God
[1:14:04] displayed over Egypt and judgment come
[1:14:06] upon the world it was the hand of the
[1:14:09] angel that gave the prophet his
[1:14:10] commission see it wasn't the man that
[1:14:12] done it anyway it was the hand of the
[1:14:14] angel that had commissioned him to go do
[1:14:16] the work it was the hand of the angel
[1:14:19] that done every Mighty work it's the
[1:14:20] hand of the angel that that performs
[1:14:22] Miracles the Bible said he brought them
[1:14:24] out after they had showed them wonders
[1:14:27] and signs in the land of Egypt and in
[1:14:29] the Red Sea and in the wilderness for 40
[1:14:31] years Stephen said this is that Moses
[1:14:33] which said unto the children of Israel a
[1:14:35] prophet shall the Lord your God raise up
[1:14:37] unto you of your brethren like unto me
[1:14:40] and him shall he hear Now watch how
[1:14:41] Steven brings this all the way from the
[1:14:43] Old Testament all the way to where we
[1:14:45] are he said see a Prophet this Prophet
[1:14:47] that was called of God by the hand of
[1:14:49] the Angel they performed Mighty Miracles
[1:14:51] but here this Prophet said there's going
[1:14:53] to come another one godas ra up a
[1:14:55] prophet the Lord your God will raise up
[1:14:57] like your brethren like unto me him
[1:14:59] shall you hear and notice when this
[1:15:01] Prophet came I know this may stumble
[1:15:02] some but it's the gospel truth that
[1:15:04] Jesus was a prophet hello somebody I
[1:15:06] know they try to put that out and the
[1:15:08] these Spirit going around today trying
[1:15:10] to tell people there was no Prophet
[1:15:12] after John the Baptist it's a lie it
[1:15:14] come from the pits of Hell the truth is
[1:15:15] he was a prophet see Moses said he's
[1:15:18] coming he'll be a prophet he come after
[1:15:20] John the Baptist he was a prophet he
[1:15:22] knew he he was God in in a man formed
[1:15:25] the very the very gift of Prophecy the
[1:15:27] gift of priesthood everything that a man
[1:15:29] could be that God ever had was in that
[1:15:31] man Jesus Christ and this Prophet when
[1:15:34] he came he told his disciples I'm going
[1:15:36] to go and prepare a place for you and
[1:15:38] I'll come again and receive you unto
[1:15:40] myself that same Jesus now watch it goes
[1:15:43] from it goes from Moses are you with me
[1:15:45] goes from Moses all the way to Jesus and
[1:15:47] now watch what Jesus does with it he
[1:15:49] said that same Jesus he said Elijah
[1:15:52] shall come and he has come already and
[1:15:55] he goes on down to the next level and
[1:15:57] says to prepare the hearts of the people
[1:15:59] that there's going to be the spirit of
[1:16:00] Elijah that comes in the last day you
[1:16:02] realize what the spirit of Elijah was to
[1:16:04] come for it was to prepare the hearts of
[1:16:06] people to receive Christ isn't that what
[1:16:08] John the Baptist done Jesus said if
[1:16:10] you'll accept it this this John the
[1:16:12] Baptist that was the spirit of Elijah he
[1:16:14] said he has come and he shall come but
[1:16:16] what did it do it in it turned the
[1:16:18] hearts of people that they could receive
[1:16:20] Christ but notice and whenever he done
[1:16:23] this see it wasn't it wasn't meant it
[1:16:25] wasn't meant to turn you to a man it was
[1:16:27] meant to turn you to Christ this is what
[1:16:29] the spirit of Elijah is to do so many
[1:16:31] today got that so warped they got their
[1:16:33] minds are so warped and it turned them
[1:16:35] after following after a man that ain't
[1:16:36] what this is about at all but it was to
[1:16:38] turn the people their hearts to be able
[1:16:40] to to be able to receive Christ it was a
[1:16:42] soften their heart isn't that what Moses
[1:16:44] done he said sanctify yourself get
[1:16:47] prepared we're going to meet God what
[1:16:48] was he doing he was trying to get the
[1:16:50] people to a place that they could stand
[1:16:52] in the presence of God again a prophet
[1:16:54] like me shall come Jesus said but there
[1:16:57] come another what's he still doing
[1:16:58] turning the hearts of people getting
[1:17:00] them prepared to be in the presence of
[1:17:02] God again all the time here he says see
[1:17:05] the spirit of Elijah notice what the
[1:17:07] spirit of Elijah done John the Baptist
[1:17:09] had a great following a great ministry
[1:17:11] but brother Joe whenever Christ entered
[1:17:13] the scene he said Behold the Lamb of God
[1:17:16] that taketh away the sin of the world I
[1:17:18] had the decrease that Christ can
[1:17:19] increase he he he he he's the one it
[1:17:22] ain't it ain't nothing to do with me and
[1:17:23] all those followers that were following
[1:17:25] John the Baptist is't that like many men
[1:17:27] today they want a great following they
[1:17:28] want people following after them they
[1:17:30] want people building them up and
[1:17:31] building up their great name but but but
[1:17:33] that don't that don't mean nothing to
[1:17:35] any godall man what the reality is is
[1:17:37] that whenever he got a congregation when
[1:17:39] Christ on the came on the scene he said
[1:17:41] this is that Christ that we've been
[1:17:42] waiting on this is he he said see Behold
[1:17:46] the Lamb of God he pointed to Christ and
[1:17:48] Christ called them out of that old law
[1:17:51] and he called them to leave that former
[1:17:53] that old former belief and that former
[1:17:55] law and to follow him how many how
[1:17:57] many's been called out this morning
[1:17:58] we've been called out to walk with God
[1:18:01] you said well where are we going well we
[1:18:03] ain't looking for a natural land but
[1:18:05] been we ain't trying to build Grace
[1:18:06] Tabernacle we a we ain't calling
[1:18:08] everybody to Grace Tabernacle but we're
[1:18:09] trying to lead people into a spiritual
[1:18:11] Kingdom into a place that the world has
[1:18:14] no power over you any longer in the
[1:18:16] Kingdom of the Messiah a kingdom that
[1:18:18] didn't governed by man a kingdom that is
[1:18:20] governed by a bishop a kingdom that
[1:18:22] isn't governed by a pastor but it's
[1:18:24] covered by the Holy Ghost and Christ is
[1:18:26] the king of it this Messianic Kingdom
[1:18:29] this is where we're trying to lead
[1:18:31] people into oh friends don't you realize
[1:18:33] that we're looking that that we're
[1:18:34] coming into a kingdom that is led by the
[1:18:36] Holy Ghost entering into a kingdom that
[1:18:39] is led by the spirit of God isn't that
[1:18:40] something that that that that following
[1:18:42] the call of God you think about it a
[1:18:44] church that refuses to follow after a
[1:18:46] bunch of men and and a bunch of man-made
[1:18:49] religions it's the church that people
[1:18:51] say is manf followers ain't that
[1:18:52] something the whole church world is
[1:18:54] following after a manmade religion you
[1:18:57] can't find it in the Bible anywhere you
[1:18:59] can't find a one of them you can't find
[1:19:00] the name of them anywhere in the
[1:19:02] scripture every bit of it was created by
[1:19:04] man the whole church world is following
[1:19:06] after a man-made religion and you let a
[1:19:08] church rise up That'll Walk Away from
[1:19:10] man-made religion and say I want to
[1:19:12] follow Jesus Christ and he alone and the
[1:19:14] and Satan turns it and twists it and
[1:19:16] says we're your manf followers watch how
[1:19:18] he tries to deceive the people but it
[1:19:20] ain't the man that we're following we're
[1:19:22] not following after a man neither was
[1:19:24] they it wasn't Moses that they were
[1:19:26] following it was the power of God That
[1:19:28] Came Upon Moses and the Hand of the
[1:19:30] Angel of the Lord that worked through
[1:19:32] Moses that attracted the people to them
[1:19:34] that caused them to leave their homes
[1:19:35] and forsake everything that they have
[1:19:37] and walk out in the middle of a
[1:19:39] Wilderness said what is it we're
[1:19:41] following after it's the spirit of God
[1:19:43] it's the angel of the Lord the hand of
[1:19:45] the angel that is leading the church
[1:19:47] today it's the same hand of the same
[1:19:49] Angel that's still leading God's Church
[1:19:51] to see here we come out we're following
[1:19:53] the call of God
[1:19:55] this call Brother David that brought the
[1:19:58] supernatural back to the church again
[1:20:00] sir think about what had done what was
[1:20:02] this call for in this hour it was the
[1:20:04] return of the supernatural you realize
[1:20:06] that when they left Egypt and they saw
[1:20:08] these great miracles of god this Red Sea
[1:20:10] opened up all these great things that
[1:20:12] God done the pillar fire leading them
[1:20:14] but you realize that this that that that
[1:20:16] that wasn't the first time that the
[1:20:17] supernatural was done in Israel see it
[1:20:20] had been a while but it wasn't the first
[1:20:22] time see all the way back Abraham
[1:20:24] remember remember before they ever went
[1:20:25] to Egypt Abraham when he went out he
[1:20:27] took some trained servants and went out
[1:20:29] and defeated a whole bunch of Kings you
[1:20:30] tell me how he done it if it wasn't
[1:20:32] Supernatural he didn't have an army big
[1:20:34] enough to to defeat Kings but but but
[1:20:36] but by the supernatural by the hand of
[1:20:38] the Angel of the Lord he was able to
[1:20:40] overcome what was it that when when
[1:20:42] Abraham that went up on the mountain and
[1:20:44] he was going to sacrifice his own son
[1:20:46] but something placed a ram in the
[1:20:47] thicket when he turned around and said
[1:20:49] here here a ram just happened to be
[1:20:51] caught in the thicket what hand put the
[1:20:53] ram in the thicket it it was the hand of
[1:20:55] the Angel of the Lord that gave Abraham
[1:20:57] his commission he put an angel in the
[1:21:00] thicket what was it that took elaser
[1:21:02] when he went down and he began to pray
[1:21:04] and he said Lord let the woman say when
[1:21:06] I say can I again you give me something
[1:21:08] to drink let her say that not only will
[1:21:11] I give you something but I'll also water
[1:21:12] your camels Lord that I shall know and
[1:21:14] the Bible says as soon as he stopped
[1:21:16] praying he a woman come walking by the
[1:21:18] well he said he said can you give me
[1:21:19] something to drink she said not only
[1:21:21] will I give you something to drink but
[1:21:22] I'll Water all your campbel also she
[1:21:24] what was it it was the supernatural
[1:21:26] before they ever they came into this
[1:21:28] place of Egypt what in Joseph's life his
[1:21:31] entire life was a life of Supernatural
[1:21:33] he saw Visions he he saw dreams God done
[1:21:36] many of great work in Joseph's life all
[1:21:38] the way to the time he went into Egypt
[1:21:40] and and miracles and dreams and
[1:21:42] interpretations while he was living in
[1:21:44] Egypt all of this happened and then the
[1:21:46] children of Israel came into a place of
[1:21:49] bondage after all these many miracles
[1:21:52] and Supernatural then they come to this
[1:21:54] place of bondage and notice what
[1:21:56] happened this bondage it lasted for a
[1:21:58] certain time can we call it an age an
[1:22:01] age of bondage this time period of
[1:22:02] bondage that came upon the people but at
[1:22:05] the end of this age of bondage but David
[1:22:08] come the supernatural Again by in this
[1:22:11] good it was just kind of a just seemed
[1:22:12] like it had gone away for a little while
[1:22:15] you know here this few hundred years
[1:22:16] that they had gone through that you
[1:22:17] didn't there's not a lot of Miracles
[1:22:19] that you read about when they were in
[1:22:20] this land of Egypt but here but but but
[1:22:22] then all of a sudden as this time comes
[1:22:24] the supernatural begin to return and
[1:22:27] then when it to return to Israel it it
[1:22:29] it rose up and and power come back to
[1:22:32] the church brother Jared and as they
[1:22:34] come to to come out of this place you
[1:22:36] realize it wasn't the strength of their
[1:22:38] army it wasn't the strength of a man it
[1:22:40] was the power of a supernatural God that
[1:22:42] led them out of this land of Egypt and
[1:22:45] the Bible says but in the last days God
[1:22:47] will raise up a church so let me ask you
[1:22:50] this morning here's my question what do
[1:22:52] you think this church will be if God is
[1:22:55] going to raise up a church maybe you
[1:22:56] look at it and say well you know it
[1:22:58] looked like the church was down it look
[1:23:00] they went through the Dark Ages they
[1:23:01] certainly went through a period where it
[1:23:03] looked like the fire of God had gone out
[1:23:04] but what do you think's going to happen
[1:23:05] in the end time the Bible says I will
[1:23:08] restore sayeth the Lord and so when God
[1:23:11] come in this end time he's going to
[1:23:12] raise up a church in this last day's
[1:23:14] Church he'll raise up a church that has
[1:23:16] the same power that that first church
[1:23:18] had it'll be raised up a powerful Church
[1:23:20] it'll be raised up a supernatural Church
[1:23:22] it ain't going to be a powerless church
[1:23:24] I know what the devil tries to tell you
[1:23:25] that the church has lost its power you
[1:23:27] know why he does that cuz a lot of times
[1:23:29] you don't fight back in the middle of a
[1:23:31] battle and so the enemy says well you
[1:23:33] ain't got no power you're afraid to
[1:23:34] fight back won't you stand up and fight
[1:23:36] you're afraid to fight back but let me
[1:23:37] tell you a secret while we're here
[1:23:39] silence is no sign that that you have no
[1:23:42] power the children of Israel never moved
[1:23:44] until God LED them to move just because
[1:23:46] you don't fight back it don't it it's
[1:23:48] not a sign of weakness the Bible says
[1:23:50] vengeance is mine sayeth the Lord so
[1:23:52] because you don't fight back it don't
[1:23:54] make you to weak matter of fact it's a
[1:23:55] power that causes you to be able to
[1:23:57] stand and rely upon God but you me tell
[1:23:59] you what we do as Believers I I may as
[1:24:01] well preach it on here but we wait on
[1:24:03] the Lord you say what do you mean we
[1:24:04] wait we don't get ahead of God you a't
[1:24:06] get in trouble get ahead of God you a't
[1:24:08] get in trouble go solve your problems
[1:24:09] get ahead of God but we wait on the Lord
[1:24:12] because God knows all things waiting on
[1:24:15] God let me tell you when you're waiting
[1:24:16] on God it's not a sign of weakness when
[1:24:18] you're waiting on God it's not a sign of
[1:24:20] fear when you're waiting on God it's an
[1:24:22] act of courage to wait upon the Lord and
[1:24:25] allow God to move in the way he wants to
[1:24:28] but you think about this Israel they
[1:24:30] never fought until God said so you think
[1:24:32] but even when they're waiting on God
[1:24:34] listen what God says I I I love this can
[1:24:37] I read it do I have just a few minutes
[1:24:40] Deuteronomy 7 he said and thou shalt not
[1:24:42] be afraid of them for the Lord thy God
[1:24:45] is among you and he's Mighty and
[1:24:47] terrible God tells his people don't be
[1:24:49] afraid of them we're waiting we don't
[1:24:51] know what's about to happen there's a
[1:24:53] battle I know that we have to fight but
[1:24:55] don't be afraid of them for the Lord is
[1:24:57] among you and he's Mighty and terrible
[1:24:59] the whole time the enemy is still there
[1:25:00] they're thriving they're growing having
[1:25:02] children raising up an army but God says
[1:25:04] just
[1:25:05] wait but don't be afraid of them when
[1:25:07] you see them for the Lord your God is
[1:25:09] among you what's he doing he's building
[1:25:10] up faith God is among you he's fighting
[1:25:14] your battles you listen he covers every
[1:25:16] angle you know what God said he said
[1:25:18] don't go in there in a hurry and try to
[1:25:20] solve this yourself this is a word from
[1:25:22] the Lord don't go in want to hurry and
[1:25:24] try to solve this yourself but wait on
[1:25:26] the Lord because if you run them out the
[1:25:29] Beast of the field will take over you
[1:25:31] won't have the ability to be able to
[1:25:33] protect the land and the Beast of the
[1:25:34] field will take over and it'll destroy
[1:25:36] all of your livestock it'll kill you out
[1:25:38] so don't go in a hurry wait on the Lord
[1:25:41] he said and when the battle comes I'll
[1:25:43] send in Hornets to drive them out from
[1:25:45] before you and then you shall go in and
[1:25:47] take what belongs to you see there ain't
[1:25:49] no sense in getting in a hurry wait on
[1:25:51] the Lord he covers every angle you see
[1:25:54] so when we're waiting on God we're not
[1:25:56] we we're waiting on the Lord to come and
[1:25:58] see before they would ever go to the
[1:25:59] promised land notice what God gives here
[1:26:01] they're they're getting prepared and
[1:26:02] they're about to go to this place but
[1:26:04] the Bible says but when the Lord shall
[1:26:05] bring thee into the land when you go to
[1:26:08] possess it and has cast out all the
[1:26:10] nations before thee did you hear it when
[1:26:12] you go to the land of Bessa and he has
[1:26:14] cast out the Nations before thee you say
[1:26:17] well they were still there they were
[1:26:18] cast out but I still seen them but God
[1:26:20] said they was cast out but they were
[1:26:22] still Giants but God said they was cast
[1:26:24] out he said he has cast him out before
[1:26:26] you that means whenever you face him
[1:26:27] they're not going to be able to stand
[1:26:30] said he has cast him out before you you
[1:26:31] said yeah brother but Israel had a big
[1:26:33] army no wonder that that that that would
[1:26:35] happen you know after all there was two
[1:26:37] million there was two million men that
[1:26:39] was in that great Army you know there
[1:26:40] there was a great many of them but
[1:26:41] listen what the Bible says he said but
[1:26:43] when he's cast him out before you the
[1:26:44] Hittites and gites and amorites and
[1:26:46] Canaanites and perizzites and hivites
[1:26:48] and jebusites Seven Nations that are
[1:26:51] greater and mightier than thou right
[1:26:54] listen listen they weren't greater than
[1:26:55] the ones they were going to fight the
[1:26:57] Bible says every one of those nations
[1:26:58] were greater and mightier than the
[1:27:00] children of Israel but God said but when
[1:27:02] you go to possess it I'll cast them out
[1:27:04] before you they're bigger enemy but when
[1:27:06] you go to possess it I'll cast them out
[1:27:07] before you I'm not going to be able to
[1:27:09] overtake them but when you go to possess
[1:27:10] it I'll cast them out before you friends
[1:27:12] don't you realize God didn't choose them
[1:27:15] to be victorious because of their power
[1:27:17] he didn't choose them to be victorious
[1:27:19] because of their skill or because of how
[1:27:21] many there was and God didn't choose you
[1:27:23] because your strength or because of your
[1:27:25] power or because of your widths or your
[1:27:27] mind it had nothing to do with you but
[1:27:29] the Bible says he chose them he said I
[1:27:31] didn't choose you because you were
[1:27:33] greater or because you were more people
[1:27:35] because you're the fewest of all I
[1:27:37] didn't choose you because you were big I
[1:27:39] didn't choose you because you were
[1:27:41] strong he said but I want you to let the
[1:27:42] people know that I chose you because I
[1:27:45] loved
[1:27:46] you I chose you because I love you and
[1:27:49] I'll drive your enemy out before
[1:27:52] you God taking a way for the children of
[1:27:56] God to possess the promise that he had
[1:27:58] given to them he said know therefore
[1:28:00] that the Lord thy God he is God he's
[1:28:02] faithful which keepeth the Covenant of
[1:28:04] Mercy to them that love him and keeps
[1:28:06] his Commandments but listen the whole
[1:28:09] promise of God it was a victory this
[1:28:12] whole promise it was a victory there's
[1:28:13] coming a victory when you get to this
[1:28:14] land of possession this is way before
[1:28:16] they ever entered into this land or came
[1:28:18] to the came to the Border but when you
[1:28:20] get there I'll drive them out when you
[1:28:21] get there you'll overcome when you get
[1:28:23] there the enemy will be be gone when you
[1:28:24] get there the Hornets are going to come
[1:28:26] I'm going to push them out years before
[1:28:29] they ever come to the battle but then
[1:28:31] there Comes A Time For The Carter of
[1:28:34] possession see they had this promise the
[1:28:36] whole time that when we come to this
[1:28:37] battle can you imagine the faith they
[1:28:39] had going over there my God said when we
[1:28:41] get there he's going to drive them out
[1:28:42] we're going to whoop them they that
[1:28:44] devil ain't got a chance you just wait
[1:28:45] till I get out you just bring on the
[1:28:46] battle devil you just wait till I get
[1:28:47] him right in my sides boy I'm going to
[1:28:49] wear him out see it was the promise but
[1:28:52] then when it came the time to take the
[1:28:54] possession of it they sent the spies in
[1:28:56] to spy out the land the majority of the
[1:28:58] people heard a negative report from 10
[1:29:00] spies only two of them came back and
[1:29:01] said they could still take it they
[1:29:03] forgot the promise of God and they
[1:29:05] looked at all the things that was going
[1:29:06] on and 10 of them come back and said
[1:29:08] this is impossible task we ain't going
[1:29:10] to be I don't I don't know where y'all
[1:29:11] getting this Theory but we're going to
[1:29:12] be able to take this we can't get a the
[1:29:13] there's Giants in this land we can't
[1:29:15] take it but then there was two that was
[1:29:17] not looking at the things that was going
[1:29:18] on in the land they wern't looking at
[1:29:20] the Giants and the impossibility of the
[1:29:22] task but they looked at the promise of
[1:29:24] God he said but the word says we'll take
[1:29:26] it and we're going to take it Caleb said
[1:29:29] I may be old man but I'm going to get my
[1:29:30] Mountain said it belongs to me God has
[1:29:33] promised us our possession but you
[1:29:34] notice notice what God does when they
[1:29:37] saw how great the battle was they
[1:29:39] actually were distressed they got in
[1:29:40] fear they were perplexed about it is
[1:29:43] that the way we do when we've had a
[1:29:44] promise of God the Bible says in the
[1:29:46] last days perilous times shall come it's
[1:29:48] been a promise all along but then when
[1:29:50] perilous time comes people lose Faith
[1:29:52] they stop they stop serving God they
[1:29:54] they they they turn their back I this is
[1:29:56] impossible I I don't see how there could
[1:29:57] be a Rapture anyway while the world look
[1:29:59] at the condition of the world how can it
[1:30:01] get any worse than this I think it's
[1:30:02] going to go on forever and it's never
[1:30:04] going to end but the Bible said here's a
[1:30:05] promise it's coming to this time and at
[1:30:07] this time many will turn away and
[1:30:09] they'll turn their their back on God you
[1:30:11] see perilous times have come people get
[1:30:14] scared and when the when the when the
[1:30:16] promise is fulfilled when it comes to
[1:30:17] the time of possession here here they're
[1:30:19] they're supposed to be holding on to a
[1:30:20] promise and people turned their back on
[1:30:22] God and they left the they left the word
[1:30:24] and then the devil tries to tell you
[1:30:25] you're going to follow right along with
[1:30:26] them but I think there ought to be a spy
[1:30:28] to raise up and say but God said he said
[1:30:32] that this will happen he said we'd come
[1:30:33] to this land he said there'd be perilous
[1:30:36] times he said people would turn their
[1:30:38] back he said there'd be scoffers he said
[1:30:40] there' be Skeptics he said there'd be
[1:30:42] persecutors but he said we'll still
[1:30:44] overcome there got to be somebody
[1:30:46] that'll take the word of God and stand
[1:30:48] on the promise of God in this age in the
[1:30:51] last days there had to be somebody that
[1:30:54] would say but the Lord will surely
[1:30:55] Deliver Us you watch it doubt and fear
[1:30:58] entered their hearts until most of them
[1:31:00] had lost all their faith their ability
[1:31:02] to be able to enter in but notice what
[1:31:03] God does here they're on the brink of
[1:31:06] their possession can I hurry come on
[1:31:10] please they're on the brink of their
[1:31:12] possession they're on the they're on the
[1:31:14] border after all these years of holding
[1:31:16] on to a promise of God here they're on
[1:31:18] the brink of possession and the Bible
[1:31:20] says at this time at the time of
[1:31:22] possession can I say it like like this
[1:31:24] at the time of inheritance here they're
[1:31:26] on the the brink of this inheritance
[1:31:28] listen what the Bible says when you go
[1:31:30] out to the battle against your enemies
[1:31:32] and you see horses and chariots and
[1:31:35] people more than you be not afraid of
[1:31:38] them for the Lord thy God is with thee
[1:31:40] which brought thee up out of the land of
[1:31:41] Egypt here God puts that the enemy is
[1:31:44] going to be great it'll be big it'll
[1:31:47] it'll it'll seem impossible it'll be a
[1:31:49] impossible task but don't be afraid of
[1:31:51] them for the god that brought you out of
[1:31:52] the land of Egypt show be with you and
[1:31:54] it shall be when you come now under the
[1:31:56] battle that the priest shall approach
[1:31:58] and speak unto the people and say unto
[1:31:59] them here oh Israel you approach this
[1:32:01] day un battle against your enemy let not
[1:32:04] your hearts faint fear not and do not
[1:32:06] tremble neither be terrified because of
[1:32:08] them for the Lord your God is he that
[1:32:11] goeth with you to fight with you against
[1:32:13] your enemies and to save you man ain't
[1:32:17] that good at the time of the greatest
[1:32:19] battles that we ever face the greatest
[1:32:21] battle here the time to be able to B
[1:32:24] possess something don't you realize why
[1:32:25] Satan fights you and these young people
[1:32:27] why he fights these young people because
[1:32:29] they're at this time of possession at a
[1:32:31] time of inheritance on the on the brink
[1:32:33] of a possession of of the of the promise
[1:32:35] of God in this hour the baptism of the
[1:32:37] Holy Ghost and Satan would fight it any
[1:32:39] young believer that could testify any
[1:32:41] any any of the saints that could testify
[1:32:43] this morning that when it come to that
[1:32:45] time of receiving the Holy Ghost it was
[1:32:46] the greatest battle you ever fought to
[1:32:48] turn how manyan testify there great
[1:32:49] battle go ahead and lift your hand let
[1:32:51] somebody see all over the building it
[1:32:52] was a time of great battle in your flesh
[1:32:55] because you're wanting to receive a
[1:32:56] promise of God that's when Satan Wars on
[1:32:58] you the most when you're trying to move
[1:33:00] further with God Satan's Waring against
[1:33:02] you it's a sign that that he's afraid of
[1:33:04] what you're going to what you're going
[1:33:05] to get say see but they come to this
[1:33:08] place the greatest battle they ever
[1:33:10] would face and notice what God done the
[1:33:12] Bible said but the priest would come and
[1:33:14] speak unto them isn't that wonderful
[1:33:17] here in the middle of a great battle
[1:33:19] this is the promise of God that I'm
[1:33:20] going to send a minister to speak to you
[1:33:23] in the time when you feel like that you
[1:33:25] cannot you can't go another step further
[1:33:28] I'm going to send a minister to speak to
[1:33:30] you this is what God told Moses to do
[1:33:32] because I know it's going to be a battle
[1:33:34] and they're going to need faith and
[1:33:35] they're they're going to need the the
[1:33:36] ability to take that next step why they
[1:33:38] wouldn't take a step over into that land
[1:33:40] he said but I'm going to send a minister
[1:33:42] to preach to you and that Minister he's
[1:33:44] going to say you approach this day unto
[1:33:47] battle against your enemy but don't let
[1:33:49] your heart fail don't tremble fear not
[1:33:53] neither be ter IED because of them for
[1:33:55] the Lord your God goes with you to fight
[1:33:58] with you for you against your enemies
[1:34:01] and he will save
[1:34:03] you I'm going to send a minister to tell
[1:34:07] you that in the time of a battle fear
[1:34:10] not do not tremble fear not brother
[1:34:12] Morgan don't tremble for I will go
[1:34:15] before you I will fight for you and I'll
[1:34:18] save you you see what the minister was
[1:34:20] for brother Jared the minister was sent
[1:34:23] to preach the prophet promise of God he
[1:34:25] was sent to preach it wasn't to preach
[1:34:27] fear and confusion I I know I've about
[1:34:29] run out of time but there's all kinds of
[1:34:32] things that people preach today but that
[1:34:33] ain't what a god- calleded minister
[1:34:34] supposed to do he's supposed to preach
[1:34:37] the promise of God he's supposed to
[1:34:38] bring the faith of God to the people and
[1:34:40] to let them know who God is and the
[1:34:42] promise that God has given to the church
[1:34:44] and to lead the church into their
[1:34:46] possession that's what a God called
[1:34:48] preacher is supposed to do to lead you
[1:34:51] into the promise that God has given unto
[1:34:53] you brother said you mark my word he
[1:34:55] said there's Great Men on the road to
[1:34:56] this world there's great powers on the
[1:34:58] road to this world and it'll be a people
[1:35:01] that'll call out of people ain't that
[1:35:02] something great men of power you say
[1:35:04] what power it's a godall people led by
[1:35:07] the spirit of God Leading the People out
[1:35:10] of all these things they lead them out
[1:35:12] of bickerin and confusions lead them
[1:35:14] back to Faith and back to the power of
[1:35:15] God he said but thank God in the last
[1:35:17] age there will be a group rise up the
[1:35:19] true Bride of the last day and she will
[1:35:21] listen to the spirit of God and in that
[1:35:24] day of gross Darkness the light will
[1:35:26] return by the pure word and we will
[1:35:28] return to the power of Pentecost to
[1:35:30] welcome back the Lord Jesus Christ isn't
[1:35:33] that a promise for the church today that
[1:35:35] in that last day in that last age we
[1:35:37] will return to the power of Pentecost
[1:35:40] and welcome back the Lord Jesus Christ
[1:35:42] you got to think about this Pentecost as
[1:35:44] the musicians to come you realize that
[1:35:46] this Pentecost or this this this age of
[1:35:49] the Holy Ghost it's not it's not just a
[1:35:51] word but it's actually an age the
[1:35:53] Pentecost
[1:35:54] Pentecost is an age it was the time of
[1:35:55] the Holy Ghost but said see at the end
[1:35:57] of each age another age would come
[1:35:59] ushering in a new age remember at the
[1:36:01] end of at the end of just skipped to the
[1:36:03] at the end of sanctification the
[1:36:04] Pentecostal age had ushered in so
[1:36:06] Pentecost came in and then it ushered in
[1:36:09] the baptism of the Holy Ghost you say
[1:36:11] what was it it was the same thing that
[1:36:12] happened on the book of Acts and when
[1:36:14] the day of Pentecost was fully come they
[1:36:16] were in one Accord in one place and they
[1:36:19] appeared un them like clothing tongues
[1:36:20] as fire it set on them they were filled
[1:36:22] with the Holy Ghost and they spoke with
[1:36:23] other tongues as the spirit gave them
[1:36:25] utterance a't that something I know what
[1:36:28] the world took it and twisted up but
[1:36:30] when you receive the Holy Ghost then
[1:36:32] you'll you'll speak with tongues so the
[1:36:34] church World they go around and bang
[1:36:36] people on the chin and all this stuff
[1:36:37] when they come up to the altar I've been
[1:36:38] to Pentecostal churches I've been
[1:36:40] sitting in the back and a good friend of
[1:36:43] mine he's a Pentecostal pastor and we
[1:36:44] went to a big meeting out in Texas one
[1:36:46] time and I was over in that area he said
[1:36:48] won't you come hear me preach I said
[1:36:49] okay I will I went by and the poor
[1:36:51] sincere people back there in the in the
[1:36:53] back and really needing something from
[1:36:55] the Lord come up the altar ladies up
[1:36:57] there banging him on the chin trying to
[1:36:58] get them to speaking tongues and
[1:36:59] nonsense I thought the sad thing is that
[1:37:01] they sincerely needed something from the
[1:37:03] Lord there really was something in their
[1:37:05] heart they were they were longing for
[1:37:07] something but they thought well if I
[1:37:08] can't get them to speak in tongues well
[1:37:09] they never got nothing you see how it
[1:37:11] got all twisted but that wasn't what
[1:37:13] that was you see in the book of Acts you
[1:37:14] say well that's what the book of Acts
[1:37:16] says they came out and spoke with in
[1:37:17] other tongues but listen what the Bible
[1:37:18] says at that time can I finish this at
[1:37:21] that time in Jerusalem was a devout men
[1:37:24] out of every nation under the heaven I
[1:37:26] won't read them all but every nation was
[1:37:27] represented in Jerusalem and the Bible
[1:37:29] said when when this it was noise abroad
[1:37:32] that the multitude came together and
[1:37:33] they were confounded when they come out
[1:37:35] of the upper room and they were speaking
[1:37:36] in unknown tongues the Bible said they
[1:37:37] were confounded because every man heard
[1:37:39] them speak in his own language and they
[1:37:41] were amazed and they marveled and they
[1:37:43] said one to another are these not all
[1:37:45] which speak galileans then how do we
[1:37:47] hear every man in our own tongue where
[1:37:50] wherein that we were born in other words
[1:37:52] we do hear the them speak in our tongues
[1:37:55] what were they hearing they were hearing
[1:37:56] the Bible says they heard them speak of
[1:37:58] the wonderful works of God isn't it
[1:38:01] something so the miracle of Pentecost it
[1:38:03] wasn't that they spoke in tongues like
[1:38:05] the world has made it the miracle of
[1:38:06] Pentecost is that every man heard in his
[1:38:09] own language the wonderful works of God
[1:38:12] the works of God and here they were each
[1:38:14] one represented in this whole body of
[1:38:16] people and they heard when they come out
[1:38:17] of the upper room some was speaking in
[1:38:19] Persian someone speaking in the me
[1:38:21] someone speaking in in Galilean someone
[1:38:23] they were all speaking a different
[1:38:25] language testifying of the wonderful
[1:38:27] works of God I thought my a it something
[1:38:29] to hear the Bible said because God had
[1:38:31] told them that the repentance and the
[1:38:33] remission of sins should be preached in
[1:38:35] my name among all nations beginning at
[1:38:38] Jerusalem this is what Jesus told the
[1:38:39] disciples so when they come out of the
[1:38:41] upper room they fulfill the commission
[1:38:43] of Jesus by testifying everyone in his
[1:38:46] own language everyone heard in his own
[1:38:48] language and right there beginning at
[1:38:50] Jerusalem the Gospel of Jesus Christ be
[1:38:53] began to be preached it's no wonder they
[1:38:55] spoke with tongues they were fulfilling
[1:38:57] the words of Jesus the message you think
[1:39:00] about this message it was being preached
[1:39:02] for the first time out of the mouth of
[1:39:04] 120 Holy Ghost filled men and women
[1:39:07] declaring the resurrection of Jesus
[1:39:09] Christ and brother maram said see it had
[1:39:11] to be testified in every language of the
[1:39:13] resurrection of Christ so it would go to
[1:39:16] all the world right there and these
[1:39:18] carriers here these people in here
[1:39:21] worshippers would go back into their own
[1:39:23] country I isn't that something brother
[1:39:25] Jared it was worshippers that went to
[1:39:28] preach and to spread the
[1:39:30] message before there was ever a so one
[1:39:33] he said these worshippers my makes me
[1:39:35] want to shout these worshippers spread
[1:39:38] the gospel these worshippers they would
[1:39:41] go back to their own country before a
[1:39:43] soul was one before a minister ever
[1:39:46] preached before there was a sermon that
[1:39:48] was ever preached they were first
[1:39:50] worshippers you see before you say I
[1:39:52] want to do something for God I'm going
[1:39:53] to preach I I'm going to do but before
[1:39:55] you can ever be a preacher you must
[1:39:56] first be a worshipper I want to be a
[1:39:58] deacon I I want to serve the Lord I want
[1:40:00] to I want to help and House of God I
[1:40:01] want God to accept my My Sacrifice but
[1:40:03] before you can do anything from God for
[1:40:05] God you must first be a worshipper see
[1:40:07] that worship is how you recognize the
[1:40:10] deity of Jesus Christ you remember when
[1:40:12] Jesus was just a child the Bible said
[1:40:13] and the three wise men when they found
[1:40:15] him they fell down before him and
[1:40:17] worship him even as a child and they
[1:40:20] open their
[1:40:22] Treasures the Bible said they opened
[1:40:24] their treasures and they gave him
[1:40:26] frankincense and gold and
[1:40:28] myrr gold think about it which
[1:40:30] represented deity and frankincense which
[1:40:32] is our service or sacrifice that a
[1:40:35] preach would make myr which was used in
[1:40:37] death the B said see it showed that
[1:40:39] deity would be put to death that he
[1:40:42] might redeem a fallen man but they came
[1:40:45] to worship Him think of it to recognize
[1:40:49] his deity they come to worship Him and
[1:40:52] the Bible says and they opened their
[1:40:53] treasures and gave to him glory you say
[1:40:57] brother M I don't have gold I have no
[1:41:00] frankincense I have no myrr I really
[1:41:02] have no gold to give what can I give to
[1:41:05] God let me tell you what you can do
[1:41:07] there's a deity in you that you can
[1:41:09] offer
[1:41:10] God you believe that there's a sacrifice
[1:41:14] there's a service and and time that you
[1:41:16] have sacrifices that you can offer unto
[1:41:18] God and there's even a death of the
[1:41:21] flesh that you can offer unto him say
[1:41:25] see you may not have gold and
[1:41:26] frankincense and myrr but brother B said
[1:41:28] I want to offer myself to God and all
[1:41:31] that I have in myself that God will give
[1:41:33] me in this life I want to dedicate it to
[1:41:35] him aresh upon the manger of the word
[1:41:37] that is in my heart I worship Him may
[1:41:41] you stand to your feet this morning you
[1:41:43] say brother man mat I want to give it to
[1:41:44] him all that I have in my life and
[1:41:48] frankincense and golden myr Lord let me
[1:41:51] die out to this flesh Lord let me give
[1:41:53] all that I have to you don't you realize
[1:41:55] friends that before you could ever do a
[1:41:57] service for God you must first become a
[1:41:59] worshipper every great man in the
[1:42:01] scripture before he done something from
[1:42:03] God Moses when he came into the presence
[1:42:05] of God Brother David he took off his
[1:42:07] shoes to show his humility in the
[1:42:10] presence of almighty God Solomon the
[1:42:14] great king of Israel he built a pull pit
[1:42:17] among all of his people he a great and
[1:42:19] mighty king when they come in before
[1:42:21] Solomon they would nap bow down on their
[1:42:23] knees because Solomon was the greatest
[1:42:25] King that had ever lived but in the
[1:42:28] presence of the people you know what
[1:42:29] Solomon done the Bible said he made a
[1:42:32] pull pit and he knelt down on his knees
[1:42:34] and he lifted his hands in the air and
[1:42:37] he said I want my people to know that
[1:42:39] there's a God that is greater than I and
[1:42:41] I worship him and all that I have and
[1:42:44] all that I gain in this Kingdom I give
[1:42:46] it back to him I belong to him he made
[1:42:49] me he's greater than I Great Men worship
[1:42:52] God
[1:42:54] Great Men great women what identifies
[1:42:56] them as great they worship God they're
[1:42:59] worshippers before they ever do anything
[1:43:02] great David was a great king he said
[1:43:04] I'll bless the Lord at all times I'll
[1:43:07] praise him with my mouth he's a
[1:43:09] worshipper I'm going to be a preacher
[1:43:11] first be a worshipper who wants to hear
[1:43:14] a preacher that ain't a worshipper who
[1:43:16] wants to hear a testimony from a person
[1:43:18] that's not a worshipper I want a true
[1:43:21] worshipper if you're going to speak and
[1:43:23] Lead God's people and help and sing you
[1:43:26] say I want to sing in the church you
[1:43:28] first be a worshipper I want to use my
[1:43:30] gift be a worshiper and give everything
[1:43:32] to God and then let God use you let him
[1:43:36] use what you what you give him we don't
[1:43:38] have a lot to offer anyway but in the
[1:43:40] hands of the Angel it becomes a mighty
[1:43:43] power Lord I give it to you use it for
[1:43:46] your glory Lord my strength I give to
[1:43:49] you use it for your glory Lord my my my
[1:43:52] time my money my effort Lord I give it

[1:44:06] Lord I come to worship you this morning
[1:44:08] we're worshippers Great Men the
[1:44:12] disciples they worshiped him said well
[1:44:15] that kind of leavs me out no it don't
[1:44:17] sister when they came out of the Tomb
[1:44:20] when they come out of the Tomb you
[1:44:21] remember the little sisters that went
[1:44:22] down to find him the Bible says when
[1:44:24] they came into his presence they fell
[1:44:26] down and worshiped him and he received
[1:44:29] their worship when they when they came
[1:44:31] to the multitude coming down out of the
[1:44:33] Mount of Olives the whole multitude
[1:44:34] worshiping see the the the the men did
[1:44:37] it the women done it the multitude the
[1:44:40] congregation done it that includes
[1:44:42] everybody there ain't not one of us left
[1:44:44] out they worship god brother Bram said
[1:44:47] this is what it is he said in the old
[1:44:49] days you'd lay your hands on that
[1:44:51] sacrifice
[1:44:53] knowing you're were a sinner he said and
[1:44:55] it identified the worshipper with his
[1:44:57] sacrifice and the priest came and he
[1:44:59] killed it and he caught the blood and
[1:45:01] the worshipper sincerely know one he
[1:45:03] said that's what God required of him he
[1:45:06] worshiped he he could he could go back
[1:45:08] to God cuz he knew he had met God's
[1:45:10] requirements said but what's your
[1:45:12] requirement this morning if God gave
[1:45:14] them a requirement then our requirement
[1:45:17] is to worship him it's to give the
[1:45:19] sacrifice of praise and thanksgiving
[1:45:21] from our lips it's our requir M to lift
[1:45:23] our hand to God it's our requirement you
[1:45:25] think oh oh the pride that people have
[1:45:28] that a King Solomon that was the
[1:45:29] greatest and most wealthy man in the
[1:45:31] world would kneel down on his knees
[1:45:33] before a Congregation of people and say
[1:45:35] I give my all to God can you imagine how
[1:45:38] the pride must have left him to think if
[1:45:39] a king could go down on his knees before
[1:45:42] God and how much how much more ought I
[1:45:44] worship Him might I just give him my all
[1:45:48] it's Pentecost it's a call to worship

[1:46:03] our hands on the sacrifice place our
[1:46:06] hands on the sacrifice that's already
[1:46:07] been made and the Bible said the
