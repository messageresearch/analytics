[41:29] I'll
[41:30] &gt;&gt; sing it once for 14 now.
[41:37] We are standing
[41:44] on holy
[41:47] ground
[41:50] and I know
[41:53] and I know
[41:56] within
[41:58] my angels
[42:01] all around.
[42:05] So let us praise.
[42:11] &gt;&gt; Yes, we
[42:13] praise your name
[42:16] &gt;&gt; Jesus.
[42:17] [Music]
[42:19] &gt;&gt; My Jesus.
[42:23] For we
[42:25] are standing in
[42:30] his presence on holy
[42:34] ground.
[42:36] &gt;&gt; Amen. How many's glad to be in the
[42:38] presence of the Lord this morning?
[42:41] &gt;&gt; Amen. How many loves the Lord?
[42:43] &gt;&gt; I mean say it's good to be in the house
[42:45] of God. Amen. And I can't think of any
[42:48] place I would rather be this morning.
[42:50] And and that to be able to stand in the
[42:53] presence of the Lord and the presence of
[42:55] his word and Amen. He is certainly a
[42:58] wonderful God. How many you enjoyed
[42:59] those uh specials this morning? God
[43:03] bless. God bless you, sisters.
[43:07] Just sure love the Lord and and just
[43:10] appreciate all that God does. And aren't
[43:13] you just happy to be in church this
[43:14] morning? I want to welcome everybody
[43:16] here and just may God richly bless you
[43:19] this morning and and our visitors this
[43:22] morning. God bless you. Just trust that
[43:24] the Lord would be able to say something
[43:26] that would be a help to you. And I know
[43:29] I hope nobody came to see me cuz I don't
[43:31] have nothing to tell you. But I know
[43:33] there's enough in the word that'll
[43:34] change all of our lives. Amen. So, uh I
[43:37] believe that's that's what we want.
[43:39] Amen. Is God uh to be able to move and
[43:41] to help us.
[43:43] Maybe we just approached the Lord this
[43:45] morning with a word of prayer. Y'all
[43:46] remember Uncle Randall in the hospital
[43:50] had fell and I broke a vertebrae I guess
[43:54] or three vertebraes in his back and was
[43:57] unstable and I just asked the Lord to be
[43:59] with them this morning. If you have a
[44:01] need on your heart, just just lift your
[44:04] hand, Lord. Also, Becca, they just had
[44:07] her baby there a couple days ago. So,
[44:10] uh, we just want to pray for her this
[44:12] morning. Let's just bow our heads
[44:13] together. Gracious heavenly father,
[44:15] Lord, we are so thankful, Lord, for an
[44:18] opportunity to come. And, Lord, just
[44:20] together in your presence, Lord, knowing
[44:23] that you know all things, Lord. And,
[44:26] Lord, I believe that you're an eternal
[44:27] God. And I believe, Lord, that you saw
[44:30] this meeting, this gathering of people,
[44:32] Lord, long before any of us ever was
[44:35] born upon this earth. And Lord, you have
[44:38] orchestrated this time, Lord, for us
[44:41] together. And Lord, to hear this word
[44:42] this morning that would be spoken. Lord,
[44:45] you know what we have need of. And Lord,
[44:47] you know where we're lacking. And Lord,
[44:49] you know what needs to be said to help
[44:52] us move further along in our walk with
[44:53] you. And Lord, I pray, Lord, that you
[44:56] would minister strength to the church
[44:57] this morning. Lord, I pray that you
[44:59] would uh minister help to them. Lord,
[45:02] those who are in need healing to those
[45:03] that need healing in their body. And
[45:05] Lord, I just ask you, Lord, to have your
[45:07] liberty in this service. Lord, may we
[45:09] just get out of the way and allow the
[45:12] the spirit of the Lord to move among us
[45:14] and minister to every heart. And Lord,
[45:16] we'll just be careful to give you the
[45:18] glory for all that you do. Lord, we pray
[45:20] that you would anoint this word this
[45:22] morning, Lord, that we would be able to
[45:24] receive from it and draw strength. We
[45:26] ask you these things in the name of
[45:28] Jesus Christ, we pray. Amen. Amen. How
[45:33] many loves the Lord this morning?
[45:35] &gt;&gt; Amen. Won't you just turn around, shake
[45:37] somebody's hand, and greet them the name
[45:39] of the Lord. Welcome in the house of
[45:40] God. Amen. And we just certainly
[45:43] certainly appreciate uh being able to
[45:47] gather together and and uh we just
[45:49] Brother Andrew asked the church to
[45:51] remember him in prayer this morning. He
[45:52] was preaching uh at brother Sean's up in
[45:55] VH Virginia. So we just trust that the
[45:58] Lord would use him in a mighty way uh to
[46:00] be a help there. Amen. and you love the
[46:03] Lord.
[46:03] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[46:04] &gt;&gt; Amen. So good to be here this morning. I
[46:06] want to invite you to the scripture to
[46:08] the book of Colossians. And uh and we're
[46:11] going to read out of the first chapter
[46:13] and the 12th verse. And we'll just get
[46:15] right into the word of God. Colossians
[46:18] the first chapter and the 12th verse in
[46:22] just a moment just to get there.
[46:26] Colossians 1 and 12. Amen. How many
[46:29] appreciates these sisters up here
[46:30] playing it? Amen.
[46:32] &gt;&gt; Brothers, brothers, play in
[46:36] sure appreciate all that everybody does.
[46:38] And man, I just feel good this morning.
[46:40] Amen.
[46:41] &gt;&gt; Amen. It just something you can feel so
[46:43] terrible when you come in the house of
[46:44] God and just a few minutes it all just
[46:46] goes away. Isn't it wonderful just to
[46:48] get in the presence of God, it just
[46:49] changes everything. Amen. How many feels
[46:52] good this morning? Amen. I want to read
[46:54] Colossians in the first chapter and
[46:55] we'll read out the 12th verse. The Bible
[46:57] says, "Giving thanks unto the Father,
[46:59] which hath made us meat to be partakers
[47:01] of the inheritance of the saints in
[47:03] light, who hath delivered us from the
[47:06] power of darkness, and hath translated
[47:08] us into the kingdom of his dear son."
[47:11] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[47:11] &gt;&gt; In whom we have redemption through his
[47:13] blood, even the forgiveness of sins.
[47:16] Hallelujah.
[47:16] &gt;&gt; Who is the image of the invisible God,
[47:19] speaking of Jesus, he's the image of the
[47:21] invisible God, the firstborn of every
[47:23] creature. For by him were all things
[47:27] created that are in heaven, that are in
[47:29] earth, visible and invisible, whether
[47:32] they be thrones or dominions or
[47:34] principalities or powers. All things
[47:37] were created by him and for him.
[47:40] &gt;&gt; And he is before all things, and by him
[47:43] all things consist. And he is the head
[47:45] of the body. I think Paul had quite a
[47:47] revelation of who Jesus really was,
[47:49] didn't he? He said, "And he is the head
[47:51] of the body, the church, who is the
[47:53] beginning, the firstborn from the dead,
[47:55] that in all things he might have the
[47:58] preeminence." Amen.
[47:59] &gt;&gt; For it pleased the Father that in him
[48:01] should all the fullness dwell, and
[48:04] having made peace through the blood of
[48:06] his cross, by him to reconcile all
[48:08] things unto himself. By him I say,
[48:11] whether they be things in earth or
[48:13] things in heaven, and you that were
[48:16] sometime alienated and enemies in your
[48:19] mind by wicked works, yet now hath he
[48:22] reconciled.
[48:22] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[48:23] &gt;&gt; And in the body of his flesh through
[48:25] death, to present you holy and
[48:28] unblameable and unreprovable in his
[48:31] sight.
[48:32] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[48:33] &gt;&gt; We'll just ask the Lord to add his
[48:34] blessing to the reading of the word this
[48:36] morning as you take your seats. And I
[48:38] would like to speak on this subject by
[48:41] him and for him. By him and for him. Now
[48:45] you know or many of you remember uh the
[48:48] story of the little boy that uh that had
[48:50] a desire to see God. He he had remember
[48:53] the little boy is a Sunday school age
[48:54] and and he had in his heart to see God
[48:57] and he went he went to his mama and
[48:59] started telling his mama. He said you
[49:01] know mama I wish I could see God. and
[49:03] and uh you know, she got to thinking on
[49:04] that and said, "Well, uh you know, I
[49:06] don't really know how to show him to
[49:08] you. Uh you know, maybe you should ask
[49:09] your Sunday school teacher that." And so
[49:11] the little boy went to his Sunday school
[49:13] teacher and he said, "You know," he
[49:15] said, "I I really want to see God." And
[49:17] I asked my mama and she told me, "Come
[49:19] and talk to you." And and the Sunday
[49:21] school teacher says, "Well, you know, I
[49:22] I don't really have an answer for that.
[49:24] Maybe you should go ask the pastor." And
[49:26] so the little boy goes to the pastor and
[49:28] he says, "You know, I really want to see
[49:30] God." And the pastor says, you know, you
[49:32] really can't see God anymore. You know,
[49:34] those days are over. You know, maybe
[49:36] when Jesus was walking on the earth and
[49:38] he was the image of God, you could see
[49:40] God in that way. But today, you can't
[49:42] see God uh like that. And so, the boy
[49:45] left there really disappointed. And uh
[49:47] you know how the story went. He got out
[49:48] there with old granddad and it was out
[49:51] in the in the uh lake and fishing and uh
[49:54] sitting out there and he could tell
[49:55] something was troubling him and
[49:57] something was on his heart. And finally,
[49:58] he just asked him, "What is it that's
[50:00] bothering you?" He said, "Well," he
[50:01] said, 'You know, I really have really
[50:03] wanted to see God. And he said, "I asked
[50:06] my mama and she couldn't show him to me.
[50:08] And I asked my Sunday school teacher and
[50:10] she didn't show him to me. And I asked
[50:12] my pastor and he said I couldn't see God
[50:14] anymore." He said, "It's just been
[50:16] really troubling me that I really wanted
[50:18] to see God." And you know, he looked
[50:20] over and that old old man, he's kind of
[50:22] looking out across the lake and tears
[50:24] started flowing down his face. And he
[50:26] looked back at the boy and he said, you
[50:27] know, he said, son, he said, all I've
[50:30] seen for the fa past 50 years has been
[50:32] God.
[50:33] &gt;&gt; He said, "Everywhere I look, I see God."
[50:35] He got to looking out at the nature and
[50:37] all the things of God and such a peace
[50:39] out on the lake. And I thought, my
[50:41] that's the way it ought to be. You know,
[50:42] there there's a way to see God. But
[50:44] remember said, "My first Bible was
[50:46] nature." He said, "I noticed everything
[50:48] taking place in nature how it had to be
[50:50] God." He said, "Nothing else could be
[50:51] that but God." And it led me to believe
[50:54] that even before he was a believer and
[50:56] before he gave his heart to the Lord, he
[50:57] said it led me to believe that there was
[50:59] some great supreme force somewhere that
[51:01] controlled all these things. I I thought
[51:03] that's the way it is, you know, with
[51:05] each one of us. Isn't it fascinating to
[51:08] see all the things that God has created?
[51:10] How how many has ever looked and seen
[51:12] how that God uh had made the moon and he
[51:15] made the stars and he made the sun and
[51:17] he made he made the planets and the
[51:20] earth and and how how tremendous of a
[51:22] thought it is to think about how that
[51:24] this earth this great ball is just
[51:26] hanging in the sky and uh in the midst
[51:28] of blackness of nothing that here here
[51:30] it would it would sit in its place and
[51:33] it would never get out of order. It
[51:34] would God keeps such an order. There's
[51:36] no way for our minds to fathom how that
[51:39] we're sitting in the midst of space and
[51:40] there's no strings attached. There's no
[51:43] uh there's no force there. Uh Brother
[51:45] Wesley, there's no physical thing that
[51:47] you could lay eyes on that keeps it in
[51:49] order. But yet, there's some
[51:50] supernatural force that keeps it in
[51:52] order and the and the perfect distance
[51:54] from the sun that it would be able to
[51:56] sustain life. I I don't know about
[51:58] y'all, but I think this planet is
[51:59] amazing. It's something amazing to think
[52:01] that uh that that God created it in such
[52:04] a way that it's in perfection that you
[52:06] and I can live and breathe and
[52:07] fellowship and uh you know you know I
[52:09] think how wonderful that God uh has
[52:11] created brother Wesley the vastness of
[52:13] his creation you know it goes from
[52:15] something great big to something so
[52:17] small you know you can see what God has
[52:19] made that the redwood trees that are 300
[52:22] foot tall how magnificent it is down to
[52:24] the smallest little lily growing in a
[52:26] field from from a from a a blue whale
[52:29] that's 100 foot long down to a little
[52:32] betta fish in a fish tank that's so
[52:34] perfected in its colors and uh but but
[52:36] God he makes mountains and he makes
[52:38] oceans and you know it it's so beautiful
[52:41] to look at the things that god has
[52:43] created you know I thought about how
[52:45] that god is such a great creator and
[52:47] what a master that uh that he is and you
[52:50] know I was looking uh the other day
[52:51] about how that nature has inspired man
[52:55] to make things and you know that that
[52:56] God made it first I just say that God
[52:58] made it first. I know man has made a lot
[53:00] of things and they've created many
[53:02] wonderful things. The mind of man is a
[53:04] great thing that God created, but God
[53:06] made it first. And you know, I was
[53:08] reading about how the in the 1990s, you
[53:10] remember the the bullet train that went
[53:12] through Japan and and they had a great
[53:15] problem with the train because when it
[53:17] would pass through uh when it would pass
[53:19] out of the tunnels, it would make such a
[53:21] sonic boom uh that that it would disturb
[53:23] the neighborhoods. And so it was a great
[53:25] trouble. They uh they had such great
[53:27] debates about it. But one of the
[53:28] engineers on the train was a bird
[53:31] watcher. He was an avid bird watcher.
[53:32] And so he got to observing how that the
[53:35] kingisher, the the the bird, the
[53:37] kingisher would dive into the water. And
[53:40] because its beak and its design was so
[53:42] perfect that it would dive into the
[53:43] water at such a great speed, but it
[53:45] would never make a splash. And so the
[53:47] engineer said, "Well, if it don't make a
[53:48] splash in water," he knew that this
[53:50] train coming out is making it's making a
[53:53] great impact on that on that atmosphere.
[53:55] And so they actually changed the design
[53:57] of the train to model after the
[54:00] kingfisher. I thought, isn't it
[54:01] something that here when man didn't have
[54:02] no idea what to do, they found something
[54:04] that God had made and it gave them the
[54:07] answer to aerodynamics in such a way
[54:09] that they created a train that was uh it
[54:12] end up being 10% faster, 15% more fuel
[54:15] efficient. It took away all the noise.
[54:17] It exited the tunnel without making
[54:19] hardly a noise in the neighborhood. All
[54:21] because they took a and modeled after
[54:23] something God had made. I I thought
[54:25] there's many things I I won't have time
[54:26] to go through them all this morning, but
[54:28] there's many things that God made that
[54:30] man has modeled after. One of the things
[54:31] that we use every day uh came from a
[54:34] Swiss engineer in 1941 when he noticed a
[54:37] cuckle bar and he got to watching how it
[54:38] got caught on his dog's hair and he took
[54:41] a microscope and actually looked at the
[54:43] cuckle bar through a microscope and he
[54:45] noticed that on the end of the cuckar it
[54:47] had hooks and so and and on the hair of
[54:50] the dog there was loops in the hair that
[54:52] it made and the hooks would stick to it
[54:53] and he invented something that made
[54:55] multi-millions of dollars all after
[54:58] something that God had created in nature
[55:00] and you Uh there there's been many
[55:02] things. There was a you know the squid
[55:04] that's translucent in its color that
[55:06] they made windows the the uh that have
[55:08] changing colors and windows after a
[55:10] squid. One of uh one of the greatest
[55:12] wind turbines that was ever created was
[55:15] created after a a whale the the the big
[55:18] uh uh um um what do they call on the
[55:21] whale? The uh uh the the the the big
[55:23] arms that the whale has. The fins. Thank
[55:25] you. A fish has something. I knew it
[55:27] wasn't arms, but the fins on a whale. Uh
[55:29] but but it had these bumps on it and you
[55:31] know aerodynamics would say that the
[55:33] smoother it is the more aerodynamic it
[55:36] would be and so our wind turbines have
[55:38] always been real smooth but somebody had
[55:40] noticed how that a whale and great in
[55:43] its size that it could turn so agile it
[55:46] could turn like on a dime and how that
[55:48] something that great big and they
[55:49] actually by by science figured out that
[55:51] it was the way that their fins were
[55:53] created that would cause them to be able
[55:55] to cut. And so they took these very
[55:57] bumps that was on a whale's fin and put
[55:59] it on wind turbines and found out that
[56:02] the bumps on it actually made a more
[56:04] efficient wind turbine. They still don't
[56:06] understand why it is because it looks
[56:08] like that without the bumps it would
[56:10] turn better and it would be it would be
[56:12] better with if it was smooth. But they
[56:14] done it the way God done it. And when
[56:16] they done it the way God done it, it
[56:17] actually is a more efficient wind
[56:19] turbine. It creates more energy. It it
[56:22] resists great powerful winds that come
[56:24] uh that come against it. I thought it
[56:26] that there there's just many great
[56:27] things when we take the way God done it
[56:29] and we could apply it to our life. And
[56:31] you know my favorite one I read, I know
[56:33] you may have seen it on Facebook or
[56:35] different things. But uh but but if you
[56:37] ever study the paragrin falcon, how
[56:39] many's ever seen a paragrin falcon? And
[56:41] if you ever watch the videos, it's
[56:42] fascinating to watch a paragrin falcon
[56:44] because or a falcon they actually they
[56:47] they've been clocked at high speed. That
[56:49] falcon falls at 242 miles per hour. This
[56:53] thing can fly through the sky. There's
[56:55] actually videos online of a falcon
[56:57] hitting its prey in the midair and it
[56:59] looks like a bullet that just went by.
[57:01] It's it's so it's so fascinating to see
[57:04] this falcon. But when the United States
[57:06] actually built our B2 bomber, uh they
[57:08] built the B2 bomber and they modeled it
[57:11] after that bird. They actually noticed
[57:13] how that when God created this tiny
[57:15] creature that there was there was an an
[57:17] avenue where wind could travel through
[57:19] its nose that would move it away from
[57:21] its respiratory system. So it could
[57:22] travel at those speeds without losing
[57:25] its air or losing its uh ability to
[57:27] breathe while it was flying. And so they
[57:29] actually designed our B2 bomber after
[57:31] that very bird. And then and today it's
[57:33] a billiondoll machine, one of the
[57:35] greatest bombers that's ever been
[57:37] created. I thought, isn't it something
[57:38] that this tiny creature that God has
[57:41] placed the intelligence that was
[57:43] necessary for one of military's greatest
[57:45] developments here? Here, all it took was
[57:47] somebody taking and looking at at some
[57:50] tiny thing that God made. I thought my
[57:52] in the midst of all of God's great
[57:54] creation here, one just one little bird
[57:56] had enough intelligence in it that that
[57:58] could create one of the greatest
[57:59] developments that that we ever made in
[58:01] our military. You know what it tells me?
[58:03] That God makes things that men don't
[58:05] have the ability to make. I say God is a
[58:07] great God. God he's able to make things.
[58:10] It's far beyond our understanding. And
[58:12] you know, I think all of science and
[58:14] research studies, they they've done all
[58:16] they could to go back in time to and
[58:19] look back in all the recorded history.
[58:20] You know, there's only a few thousand
[58:22] years of recorded history. And so they
[58:24] can go back and what's been recorded and
[58:26] passed down from man, just a few
[58:28] thousand years and they and they they
[58:30] they look back and they search for one
[58:32] thing. They're they're trying to find
[58:34] our origin and trying to find where we
[58:36] came from and where does man come from
[58:38] and where is this beginning? And you
[58:40] remember maybe a year or two ago, I'd
[58:42] actually told the a story of a of the
[58:44] Cornell University biologist and how how
[58:47] that he he was a he's a man that that
[58:50] believes in evolution and he always
[58:51] talks about the uh the architecture of
[58:53] the human body and and and he would talk
[58:55] about our body and he would say it like
[58:57] this. He said that our body was not
[58:59] designed by an intelligent designer. He
[59:01] said because if anyone had intelligence
[59:03] would design the human body then he
[59:05] would not have made the food and the air
[59:07] come through the same hole where you
[59:09] could choke or or you could or or you
[59:11] could choke on something or die or
[59:12] something that way. He says so it proves
[59:14] to you that if it would have been an
[59:16] intelligent designer well he had put
[59:18] your mouth for uh to be able to eat in
[59:20] one place and he' have put another hole
[59:22] in the head somewhere that would be able
[59:24] to to to get air if it would have been
[59:26] an intelligent designer. He said, "So
[59:28] you can see that by that that that we
[59:30] were we had to evolve into this and it
[59:32] was not an intelligence. It was just
[59:34] nature." And matter of fact, he would
[59:36] make this statement. He said, "When you
[59:37] look at our bodies from an evolutionary
[59:39] perspective, you'll see more and more
[59:42] that we are not intelligently designed."
[59:44] You know, I halfway believe one part of
[59:46] this. If you look at anything in the
[59:47] wrong perspective, you end up seeing the
[59:49] wrong thing. See, so if you look at our
[59:51] body from an evolutionary perspective,
[59:53] you start feeling like that there's no
[59:55] intelligence behind it. You know, I've
[59:57] met some people that I thought that same
[59:58] thing. There must not been much
[1:00:00] intelligence behind that creation. But
[1:00:02] you know what? We're not looking at it
[1:00:03] from our own thought and we're not
[1:00:05] looking at it from an evolutionary
[1:00:06] perspective. But he he said, "See, you
[1:00:08] see more and more." I thought, "Isn't it
[1:00:10] something that here is a man that says
[1:00:12] that we were not intelligently
[1:00:14] designed?" And you know, this is his own
[1:00:15] words. We were not intelligently
[1:00:17] designed. And I thought, my, how could
[1:00:18] you say that statement and then use your
[1:00:21] own intelligence to dedicate your life
[1:00:23] to find the history of where we came
[1:00:25] from and the cure for diseases and the
[1:00:27] cure for sicknesses? I thought, what a
[1:00:29] foolish statement this is that we that
[1:00:31] we were not designed by any
[1:00:33] intelligence, but by my intelligence,
[1:00:34] I'm going to find out where we came
[1:00:36] from. That I wasn't designed by
[1:00:37] intelligence, but by my intelligence,
[1:00:39] I'm going to find out how to cure all
[1:00:41] these diseases that there aren't no
[1:00:43] cures for. I thought, isn't it
[1:00:44] something? Why is my mouth here? And why
[1:00:46] can I breathe this way? And why is my
[1:00:49] head made like this? But I'll tell you
[1:00:50] what the Bible said. The Bible said, "Oh
[1:00:52] man, who art thou that repliest against
[1:00:55] God? For shall the thing formed, say to
[1:00:57] him that formed it, why have you made me
[1:00:59] thus?" I thought, "What a silly theory
[1:01:01] that it is." That I'll just say it like
[1:01:04] this. I'm not I'm not going to allow a
[1:01:06] biologist to redefine what intelligence
[1:01:08] is. See, he said if it was made this
[1:01:10] way, then it was unintelligent. Well,
[1:01:12] that's his definition of of
[1:01:13] intelligence. Isn't that the way it is?
[1:01:14] But I I'm not going to allow him to
[1:01:16] change what intelligence is because
[1:01:18] there was an intelligence that created
[1:01:20] man. There wasn't an intelligence that
[1:01:23] made us the way that God made us. And
[1:01:25] let me tell you what it was. That
[1:01:26] intelligence made man in his own image
[1:01:29] and he formed man out of the dust to the
[1:01:31] ground. And then the Bible said he
[1:01:32] breathed life into him and man became a
[1:01:35] living soul. That means he came alive.
[1:01:38] That which was spirit it put on the robe
[1:01:40] of flesh and now he can see and feel and
[1:01:42] taste and smell and hear. He can
[1:01:44] communicate. He can reason. He can love.
[1:01:47] He He can hate. He can feel emotions. He
[1:01:50] can breathe. All because an intelligence
[1:01:52] created you. I know it may be beyond our
[1:01:55] understanding, but I will say this, but
[1:01:56] it's still true.
[1:01:58] &gt;&gt; Our God is a creator.
[1:01:59] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:02:00] &gt;&gt; How many believe that? Say amen.
[1:02:02] &gt;&gt; Our God is a creator. You know, I think
[1:02:04] of the greatness of God's creation. You
[1:02:06] realize that the same the same God of
[1:02:08] great power that made the that created
[1:02:11] all things that created the universe and
[1:02:13] made the heavens and made the earth and
[1:02:15] made the stars and the land and the sea
[1:02:17] and the greatness of God's creation. If
[1:02:19] you could take a moment and think about
[1:02:21] all the great things that God created by
[1:02:23] his own hand and formed it. The Bible
[1:02:25] said when God got a hold of the earth,
[1:02:27] it was without form and it was void and
[1:02:29] darkness was upon the face of the deep.
[1:02:31] But then the spirit of the Lord moved
[1:02:32] upon the face of the water. What was God
[1:02:35] doing? He was creating an atmosphere for
[1:02:37] his creation that when he would create,
[1:02:39] there would be an atmosphere that would
[1:02:41] be able to create life. But that same
[1:02:43] God that made all of that is the same
[1:02:46] God that made you and I. Let me tell you
[1:02:48] friends, we weren't accidentally made,
[1:02:50] but we were made in the image of God.
[1:02:51] You were made by God, and you were made
[1:02:54] for God. He created us in his own image.
[1:02:57] &gt;&gt; What a revelation it is to just accept
[1:02:59] that God made you. Can I just say that
[1:03:01] to today? Hey, you remember you remember
[1:03:02] little Aiden when he he came out there
[1:03:04] in the shop one day. I think I told this
[1:03:06] testimony, but I was out there in the
[1:03:07] shop working and he kind of wandered out
[1:03:09] of his dad's house and come out there
[1:03:10] and he likes to hang out when Uncle
[1:03:12] Matt's around and he come out there and
[1:03:13] he pulled him up a little chair and sat
[1:03:15] there and had his feet propped up and he
[1:03:17] was watching me clean out and stuff and
[1:03:19] after a little bit just out of the blue
[1:03:21] here it was dark and I had a little fire
[1:03:22] going out there burning stuff and he
[1:03:24] moved his chair over there to the fire
[1:03:25] and just kicked back in his lawn chair
[1:03:27] here. was, you know, in the middle of
[1:03:29] the night. We were just having oursel a
[1:03:30] time. And after a minute, he just looks
[1:03:32] over at me and he says, "Uncle Matt," he
[1:03:34] says, "How did God make man? Out of
[1:03:36] dust." Just out of the blue. I was
[1:03:38] sweeping up. Had a big tile pile of dust
[1:03:40] there. And I said, "Well, buddy," I
[1:03:42] said, "Well, God God made a body." And
[1:03:43] then he he breathed into it. And you
[1:03:45] know, it it took on the form of life.
[1:03:47] And and you know, he he looked over
[1:03:49] there for a minute and he reached down.
[1:03:50] He picked him up a handful of that dust
[1:03:52] and he got to dumping it out of his
[1:03:53] hand. He said, "I know, but dust is
[1:03:55] loose and we're solid. I thought, man,
[1:03:58] what a what a what a a catch for I He's
[1:04:01] about seven years old and and I said,
[1:04:03] "Well, buddy, you know you know if you
[1:04:04] take water and and I got talking about
[1:04:06] water and clay and how you put it
[1:04:08] together and how you can form and how
[1:04:10] you know uh pottery and and bowls and
[1:04:12] cups and how that they are molded into
[1:04:14] shape and what used to be one element
[1:04:16] was formed into another element and you
[1:04:18] know and then you know I realized that
[1:04:20] wasn't enough and and it's like yeah
[1:04:21] well that's just a you know a pottery it
[1:04:23] don't really you know it don't really
[1:04:24] have a a face and a mouth you know I
[1:04:26] said they can make they make figures
[1:04:27] that that have all that stuff, you know.
[1:04:29] Yeah, but it don't it can't breathe and
[1:04:31] it can't eat. And you know, I realized I
[1:04:32] was a little bit in over my head. So,
[1:04:34] finally I just said, you know, brother
[1:04:36] or buddy, let me just tell you. I said
[1:04:38] that that that God is a creator. He
[1:04:39] said, yeah. I said, but you know what a
[1:04:40] creator is? A creator is someone that
[1:04:43] actually brings something into
[1:04:45] existence. So, so by definition, a
[1:04:47] creator is somebody that can take
[1:04:48] something that isn't there and make
[1:04:50] something that is. That's what a creator
[1:04:52] is. I said, so the reality is God is
[1:04:54] just a creator. He made the laws. He
[1:04:56] made the elements. He made the earth. I
[1:04:58] said, "And just and the very fact that
[1:04:59] God formed the earth and he can make the
[1:05:01] earth, it just proves that he can make
[1:05:03] you and I." And finally, he just sat
[1:05:04] there for a minute. He said, "Well, you
[1:05:06] know what? I'm just glad God created
[1:05:08] me." I thought, "You know what? I think
[1:05:09] that's the way we ought to be this
[1:05:10] morning. I may not be able to understand
[1:05:12] it all, and I may not explain it all."
[1:05:14] He said, "But that's good. I'm just glad
[1:05:16] we were created." I I say, "I'm just
[1:05:18] glad I was created." I thought, isn't
[1:05:20] that something that a little boy has a
[1:05:22] better revelation of the things of God
[1:05:23] than a biologist had? Here when he tried
[1:05:26] to spend his whole life trying to figure
[1:05:27] out how God made things, but here a
[1:05:29] seven-year-old boy could just say, "You
[1:05:31] know what? I'll just accept that God
[1:05:33] made me." And I'm sure glad that he did.
[1:05:35] I thought you could spend your whole
[1:05:37] life trying to find out all the ways of
[1:05:39] God, but you'll never find out all the
[1:05:41] ways of God. There's some things you'll
[1:05:43] never be able to know. There's some
[1:05:44] things you won't be able to comprehend.
[1:05:46] There's some things you won't
[1:05:47] understand. That's what keeps people
[1:05:49] from serving God. They think they have
[1:05:51] to know everything and figure everything
[1:05:52] out and know all the ins and outs and
[1:05:55] see everything just like everybody else.
[1:05:57] But that ain't got one thing to do with
[1:05:58] it. It's just accepting God as God is
[1:06:01] and accepting you as God made you as a
[1:06:03] creation of God. He said, see there's
[1:06:06] Bible says God's ways are are pathf
[1:06:08] finding out and his ways are higher than
[1:06:10] all way our ways. You know, I think we
[1:06:12] can get caught up in all the all kinds
[1:06:14] of things that can get our minds so
[1:06:16] twisted and things that can't be proven
[1:06:18] and we can get so worked up about all
[1:06:21] these things around us and how this one
[1:06:22] says this is and this one says this is
[1:06:24] and never have any answer to it. We can
[1:06:27] bring confusion to our children. We can
[1:06:29] give them more questions than there are
[1:06:31] answers. But friends, let me tell you,
[1:06:33] we didn't come here to bring questions.
[1:06:35] We come to get the answer this morning.
[1:06:37] There's some things I just say it like
[1:06:39] this. There are some things that you
[1:06:40] will never figure out and some things
[1:06:42] you don't have to figure out. There's
[1:06:43] some things you don't have to know
[1:06:45] because that we have been already given
[1:06:46] the answer to it. So I think instead of
[1:06:49] spending time trying to figure out
[1:06:51] creation, I would rather spend my time
[1:06:53] getting to know the creator a little
[1:06:55] bit. Instead of trying to spend time
[1:06:57] figuring out how God did all of this and
[1:06:59] how if if God would make that and trying
[1:07:01] to prove that God did it, I'd just like
[1:07:03] to know the one that spoke out of his
[1:07:05] mouth and said, "Let there be light."
[1:07:07] And there was light. I I just want to
[1:07:08] know the one that created earth and
[1:07:11] created man in his own image. I want to
[1:07:13] get to know him better.
[1:07:15] &gt;&gt; The Bible said in the beginning God
[1:07:16] created the heaven and the earth.
[1:07:18] Elohim, the great creator. He made the
[1:07:20] heavens and the earth. Before there was
[1:07:22] a earth, it was the Lord. It was the
[1:07:24] Elohim. Brother said it was an
[1:07:26] allsufficient one, the strong one, the
[1:07:28] almighty Elohim. He was a self-existing
[1:07:31] God. Friends, I don't care how long you
[1:07:33] preach on that, you'll never understand
[1:07:34] it. You could study about it your whole
[1:07:37] life. You can never explain to me how
[1:07:39] God existed before there was anything
[1:07:41] that existed. Our human mind cannot
[1:07:43] comprehend eternity. It can't comprehend
[1:07:46] something not having a beginning and not
[1:07:48] having an ending because we are finite
[1:07:50] in this flesh. We come out of a from
[1:07:53] from our mother and back to a grave. We
[1:07:55] we we see a beginning and we see an end.
[1:07:57] Our mind is designed that way. We can't
[1:07:59] see past that. We can't fathom eternity.
[1:08:02] But by faith we can say our God is a
[1:08:05] self-existing God. Before there was
[1:08:07] anything, there was God. He was a great
[1:08:09] spirit that moved upon the face of the
[1:08:11] waters that created the earth that
[1:08:13] created me.
[1:08:16] &gt;&gt; He made us.
[1:08:17] &gt;&gt; God created us. It's beyond our
[1:08:19] understanding. But the Bible says God
[1:08:20] created man in his own image and in the
[1:08:23] image of God created he him. Male and
[1:08:25] female created he them.
[1:08:27] &gt;&gt; Somebody needs to read that.
[1:08:30] &gt;&gt; God created us.
[1:08:32] &gt;&gt; Male and female created he them. them
[1:08:34] wasn't a uh wasn't a pronoun either. He
[1:08:37] was just saying God created both of
[1:08:38] them, male and female. So don't get it
[1:08:40] mixed up. God created male and God
[1:08:42] created female. He created them in his
[1:08:45] image. See, can I say this this morning?
[1:08:46] He made us. Somebody say he made us.
[1:08:48] &gt;&gt; He made us.
[1:08:49] &gt;&gt; We're all different, but God made us.
[1:08:51] Isn't that wonderful? You look around
[1:08:52] this room, there ain't no two alike. We
[1:08:54] We uh Vanna had twins and ain't neither
[1:08:57] one of them alike. Bless their hearts.
[1:08:58] But one of them's got little nice
[1:09:01] straight hair. The other one has a
[1:09:02] little bit different hair. But that's
[1:09:03] how you tell them apart. They have a
[1:09:05] different head of hair. And it's true.
[1:09:08] They're both beautiful in their own way.
[1:09:11] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:09:11] &gt;&gt; One of them looks like she gets her hair
[1:09:13] combed. The other one looks like they
[1:09:14] put her finger in the lights on
[1:09:17] when she's old. Y'all make sure this
[1:09:18] this isn't this this CD isn't around or
[1:09:21] DVD or whatever. Make sure she'll coming
[1:09:23] after Uncle Matt. But God made us all
[1:09:26] different. We're all created different.
[1:09:28] Brother said God's a God of variety. He
[1:09:30] makes big mountains, little mountains,
[1:09:31] big trees, little trees, big deserts and
[1:09:34] mountains and oceans because he's a God
[1:09:35] of variety. You ever notice there's some
[1:09:37] of us are redheaded, some of us are
[1:09:39] blonde, some of us are blackheaded? We
[1:09:41] we are all made different. It seems like
[1:09:42] today everybody wants to be something
[1:09:44] else and then the way God made them. But
[1:09:46] I think that's because we look in the
[1:09:47] mirror and get tired of what we see. You
[1:09:48] know, somebody ever felt that way.
[1:09:51] &gt;&gt; You get in there. I remember one of the
[1:09:52] worst things when I came home from
[1:09:53] school after science class. I was so I
[1:09:55] was so tore up. My mom, she asked me,
[1:09:57] she said, "What's the matter?" I said,
[1:09:58] "I learned the worst news this morning
[1:10:00] in in science." She said, "Well, what is
[1:10:02] it?" I said, "I learned there's two
[1:10:03] things that never stop growing." She
[1:10:04] said, "What's that?" I said, "Your nose
[1:10:06] and your ears."
[1:10:08] She said, "Well, son, that's just I
[1:10:10] said, "Yeah, that means the rest of my
[1:10:12] life they're going to keep growing. You
[1:10:14] hear that, Mom? I'm talking about I
[1:10:15] mean, they're going to keep on Oh, man."
[1:10:18] She didn't understand what I was dealing
[1:10:19] with.
[1:10:21] But, but we all, you know, we we we want
[1:10:24] to be something different. But you
[1:10:25] realize that even though we may look in
[1:10:27] the mirror and we get tired of what we
[1:10:29] see, can I say this this morning that
[1:10:31] God Y'all can't stop looking at my ears.
[1:10:36] God bless you.
[1:10:39] I grew into them.
[1:10:42] My mom said I did.
[1:10:47] Amen.
[1:10:50] Well, praise the Lord.
[1:10:56] my face.
[1:10:58] Thank you, buddy. Thank you for your
[1:11:00] support. I like having my buddy on the
[1:11:03] front row right there.
[1:11:05] God bless you. See, sometimes we get we
[1:11:08] get tired of the way that God made us.
[1:11:11] &gt;&gt; But do you realize that God never gets
[1:11:13] tired of looking at you the way he made
[1:11:15] you?
[1:11:16] &gt;&gt; You may look at you and get tired of the
[1:11:18] way you look, but God never gets tired
[1:11:19] of looking at you. The This is what
[1:11:21] David had a revelation of. He said, "He
[1:11:23] possessed my reigns. He's covered me in
[1:11:25] my mother's womb." He said, "I will
[1:11:27] praise you for I am fearfully and
[1:11:29] wonderfully made."
[1:11:30] &gt;&gt; What a revelation it is that I know that
[1:11:32] God made me and I've been wonderfully
[1:11:33] made in the eyes of God. You know, you
[1:11:35] realize that that God made us in such a
[1:11:38] way that brother would say even we would
[1:11:39] resurrect that way. He said when you're
[1:11:41] redheaded that God made you. You'll rise
[1:11:43] up red-headed. If you're blackheaded,
[1:11:44] you'll raise up blackheaded. If you're
[1:11:46] blonde, you'll raise up blonde. He said
[1:11:47] because when you put a seed in the
[1:11:49] ground of a red flower, it'll come forth
[1:11:51] a red flower. And all of Christianity is
[1:11:53] based on resurrection. And the same one
[1:11:55] that went down, that's what it's going
[1:11:56] to bring forth. So God had created you
[1:11:59] that way. He meant for you to be that
[1:12:00] way. And even you say, "Well, I want to
[1:12:02] be perfect in the sight of God." So
[1:12:04] you're going to go by the way of the
[1:12:06] grave. And when you come up in the
[1:12:07] resurrection, you're still you're still
[1:12:09] going to look like that because that's
[1:12:10] the way that God had you in his image.
[1:12:12] So we don't have to go around feeling
[1:12:14] bad about the way God made us. That
[1:12:15] that's the way that God made us. He
[1:12:17] created us in his own image. And I can
[1:12:19] say this this morning, but when that not
[1:12:21] only did he make us, but we're perfect
[1:12:22] in his sight. I'll say whenever you show
[1:12:24] me a true born again believer in the or
[1:12:27] a son and daughter of God, I'll show you
[1:12:29] somebody that's perfect in the sight of
[1:12:31] God. You're the very image that God had
[1:12:33] made you. We're perfect. We may not be
[1:12:35] perfect in each other's sight, but we're
[1:12:37] perfect in God's sight. I'm not perfect
[1:12:38] in your sight. You're not perfect in my
[1:12:40] sight. He said, but what won't we just
[1:12:42] lay aside all that and see about what
[1:12:44] about God's side? We may not be perfect
[1:12:46] to one another, but we're perfect in the
[1:12:48] sight of God. Because we looked at you,
[1:12:50] you look at me as a human. I look at you
[1:12:52] as a human. We see each other as a
[1:12:53] brother. He said, "But when God looks at
[1:12:55] you, he looks at you through the blood
[1:12:58] of his son as a redeemed one." And Jesus
[1:13:01] said, "Be you therefore perfect, even as
[1:13:03] your father in heaven is perfect. It's
[1:13:06] not what you've done or nothing that you
[1:13:08] have merited it with, but it's Christ
[1:13:10] that died for you." See, so it's not the
[1:13:12] way we see ourselves. It's not the way
[1:13:15] we see each other, but it's the way that
[1:13:17] God sees us is what matters. How many
[1:13:19] believes that? Say amen. We may not be
[1:13:21] perfect to one another. We may not be
[1:13:22] perfect to oursel, but it's the way that
[1:13:24] God sees us that matters. Brother said,
[1:13:26] "God never made two people alike."
[1:13:27] There's billions of people in this
[1:13:28] world. Do you realize out of all the
[1:13:30] billions, none of them have the same
[1:13:31] thumbrint? None of us. That's why we
[1:13:33] take fingerprints and thumbrints that
[1:13:34] none of them are alike. That's so
[1:13:36] fascinating for our mind to be able to
[1:13:38] comprehend that God would make every one
[1:13:40] of us and every one of us be different.
[1:13:42] He said, "But but God made us all
[1:13:43] different." Said, "Not only were we all
[1:13:45] made different, but but we were just we
[1:13:47] were we were not just made by him, but
[1:13:49] we were made for him to fulfill his
[1:13:51] purpose." So here, God made us all. And
[1:13:54] then we have a purpose to fulfill.
[1:13:55] That's why he said, "Don't try to
[1:13:57] impersonate somebody else or because you
[1:13:59] do what God tells you to do and stay
[1:14:01] with it because there is not one person
[1:14:03] in heaven or on earth that could ever
[1:14:06] take your place." That ought to make you
[1:14:08] shout this morning. There ain't nobody
[1:14:10] could ever I don't care how you feel
[1:14:11] about you this morning. I'm talking
[1:14:12] about how God feels about you. There
[1:14:14] ain't one person in heaven and one
[1:14:16] person on earth that could ever take
[1:14:18] your place. You were made in the image
[1:14:20] of God. You were made for God for a
[1:14:22] purpose. He said and whatever purpose
[1:14:24] God made you, you stay with that.
[1:14:27] &gt;&gt; Ain't that powerful? Nobody can take
[1:14:28] your place. You have to be you and you
[1:14:31] you have to overcome and you have to
[1:14:33] allow God to be able to use you. You
[1:14:34] say, "You mean I have a purpose?"
[1:14:36] Certainly, we all have a purpose. Our
[1:14:38] purpose is to manifest Christ in this
[1:14:40] age. Our Our purpose is to grow into the
[1:14:42] image that God has saw us in in the
[1:14:44] beginning. Our purpose is to overcome
[1:14:46] this world and overcome the age that we
[1:14:48] live in. Our purpose is to get back to
[1:14:50] that Eden condition where God and man
[1:14:53] could have fellowship and perfection
[1:14:54] again.
[1:14:56] &gt;&gt; This is the purpose of the church
[1:14:57] &gt;&gt; is to manifest him. You say, "Well,
[1:14:59] well, brother man, how do we how do we
[1:15:01] manifest him?" Well, here's what here's
[1:15:03] what prophet said. He said, "See, we
[1:15:04] manifest him. A good pre a man that is a
[1:15:07] good preacher, he can manifest him by
[1:15:09] preaching the word. A man that's a good
[1:15:10] teacher can manifest him uh by teaching
[1:15:13] about it." I I could say it like this. A
[1:15:15] a gifted singer manifest God by singing.
[1:15:18] A preacher manifest him by preaching.
[1:15:21] Even Even Brother Bam's own gift of
[1:15:22] discernment, he said that gift was there
[1:15:24] to manifest the resurrection. It was to
[1:15:27] manifest Christ in the in the power of
[1:15:28] his resurrection just to show that he
[1:15:31] wasn't in a tomb somewhere buried, but
[1:15:33] to prove to this age that Jesus Christ
[1:15:35] was still alive and still doing the same
[1:15:37] work. It was to bring faith to the
[1:15:39] church that Christ was still alive and
[1:15:41] well.
[1:15:42] &gt;&gt; Not to build up a man or the following
[1:15:44] of a man. It was to bring faith in Jesus
[1:15:46] Christ to to to combat that spirit that
[1:15:49] would come in this age to say that Jesus
[1:15:51] Christ died 2,000 years ago and he was a
[1:15:53] good man and he was a good prophet and
[1:15:55] all these things that the world says
[1:15:56] about him, but but he died and they hid
[1:15:58] his body somewhere and they don't
[1:16:00] believe in the resurrection. They don't
[1:16:02] believe in the Holy Ghost. But the gift
[1:16:03] of God came in this age to prove the
[1:16:05] resurrection and to prove the baptism of
[1:16:07] the Holy Ghost. And it wasn't something
[1:16:09] that was just some other age, but it was
[1:16:11] for you and I today.
[1:16:12] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. So see all of us can
[1:16:14] manifest him. Said well how can we do
[1:16:16] it? Said we can manifest him by his
[1:16:19] nature. See how would God be known
[1:16:21] anyway?
[1:16:23] &gt;&gt; Can I ask you that? How would he be
[1:16:25] known today? You realize that Jesus has
[1:16:27] always been unrecognized.
[1:16:29] &gt;&gt; Can I say that? Even when he was on the
[1:16:31] earth, he was unrecognized. Many would
[1:16:33] walk by him and not recognize who he was
[1:16:35] or wouldn't accept him as a son of God.
[1:16:38] They matter of fact they crucified him
[1:16:39] proclaiming who he was or and because
[1:16:42] they were others that would fall on him
[1:16:43] even in this age. You see the spirit of
[1:16:46] God move and the Holy Ghost moving and
[1:16:48] and people being healed and the dead
[1:16:49] raised and blind eyes open and the
[1:16:51] supernatural moving amongst the church
[1:16:53] today. But still yet you say, "How can
[1:16:55] God have that great of a move and still
[1:16:57] yet the world not doesn't recognize it's
[1:17:00] him?"
[1:17:00] &gt;&gt; That he's always been unrecognized. But
[1:17:03] you realize that today
[1:17:05] &gt;&gt; that though the world may not recognize
[1:17:06] him, but there is a body of people that
[1:17:08] have always recognized Christ. Amen.
[1:17:11] &gt;&gt; There's believers that have always
[1:17:12] recognized and I believe this today that
[1:17:15] this is our day to recognize him.
[1:17:17] &gt;&gt; This is our opportunity. You say, "Well,
[1:17:19] brother Matt, if I was living in Jesus's
[1:17:21] day, let me tell you which one of them I
[1:17:22] would have been."
[1:17:23] &gt;&gt; You got to be careful how you say that.
[1:17:25] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:17:26] &gt;&gt; Because there's people today that
[1:17:27] they're not believers. And you know,
[1:17:29] they they may mock you for what you
[1:17:30] believe, but but they say, "But if I was
[1:17:32] living in Jesus's day, I would have been
[1:17:34] following him around. I'd have been like
[1:17:36] a disciple." Would you really would you
[1:17:38] really been following him around
[1:17:39] whenever you said, "Well, I knew he was
[1:17:40] born of Mary and Joseph and I remember
[1:17:43] him when he was a carpenter's son and he
[1:17:45] was over there working and building
[1:17:46] furniture and stuff with his daddy." And
[1:17:48] then he would come by and said, "I I am
[1:17:50] the son of God. I was created by God."
[1:17:52] Here he was declaring himself to be the
[1:17:54] very son of God. And you would have
[1:17:56] followed after him and denounced your
[1:17:58] own church and left your own family.
[1:18:00] That don't follow after them heretics.
[1:18:02] and you would have left all your stuff
[1:18:03] at your house and followed Jesus around
[1:18:05] performing miracles and say, "I'm a
[1:18:07] follower of Jesus."
[1:18:08] &gt;&gt; Come on.
[1:18:09] &gt;&gt; Think about, be careful what you say. If
[1:18:11] I was there in Elijah's day, I would
[1:18:12] have followed after Elijah. I'd have
[1:18:14] been on Mount Carmel saying, "Go Elijah,
[1:18:16] call up on the name of your God. Your
[1:18:18] God will answer. Would you have been
[1:18:20] when Elijah when Elijah was a man that
[1:18:22] was an outcast to society and they
[1:18:24] wanted to take his life and he had to
[1:18:25] hide in a cave so that the so that the
[1:18:28] Supreme Court of that day couldn't get a
[1:18:29] hold of him and kill him like they were
[1:18:31] killing all the prophets. Would you have
[1:18:33] followed Elijah?
[1:18:34] &gt;&gt; Come on.
[1:18:35] &gt;&gt; You got to be careful what you say.
[1:18:36] Well, if I'd have been in the Bible
[1:18:37] days, I'd have been a believer then. If
[1:18:39] I'd have lived back then, I'd have been
[1:18:40] a believer. You realize that what you
[1:18:42] are today testifies about what you would
[1:18:44] have been.
[1:18:45] &gt;&gt; I'm going to tell you this. If you're an
[1:18:46] unbeliever today, you never would have
[1:18:48] been a believer. You could have seen
[1:18:49] Jesus perform miracles. You'd have came
[1:18:51] up with a reason or an excuse just like
[1:18:53] they did. They said he was be elabub.
[1:18:55] They said he was a magician. They called
[1:18:57] him a mind reader. They called him all
[1:18:58] sorts of things because Jesus was not
[1:19:01] recognized.
[1:19:02] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:19:03] &gt;&gt; And I'll say this today, he's still not
[1:19:05] recognized.
[1:19:06] &gt;&gt; But there's believers.
[1:19:08] &gt;&gt; There's believers that recognize him.
[1:19:09] Said, "How can you recognize him?" You
[1:19:11] recognize him. I feel the spirit of the
[1:19:13] Lord. You recognize him by his nature,
[1:19:16] by his characteristic. You He's always
[1:19:18] been recognized by his nature. You think
[1:19:20] about the Bible through all the Bible.
[1:19:22] It prophesied concerning the day that we
[1:19:24] live in. But it also prophesies that
[1:19:26] there's going to be all the all the all
[1:19:28] the trouble and the chaos and all the
[1:19:30] wars and everything's been prophesied.
[1:19:32] But it's also prophesied that there's a
[1:19:33] people in this age that will recognize
[1:19:35] the day that they live in.
[1:19:37] &gt;&gt; The Bible tells that, you know, and not
[1:19:39] like the days of Noah. The Bible said in
[1:19:40] the days of Noah, they were they were
[1:19:42] drinking and and eating and before the
[1:19:45] flood, they were marrying and giving in
[1:19:46] marriage until the day that Noah entered
[1:19:48] into the ark. In other words, they were
[1:19:50] just going about their dayto-day lives
[1:19:52] until the day that Noah entered into the
[1:19:54] ark. They they didn't believe the
[1:19:55] message that he preached. And the Bible
[1:19:57] said, "And they knew not until the flood
[1:19:59] came and took them all away. And so
[1:20:02] shall the coming of the son of man be
[1:20:04] that they'll go on eating and drinking
[1:20:06] and marrying and giving in marriage.
[1:20:07] They'll go about their daily lives and
[1:20:09] they'll never have and they'll never
[1:20:11] know him. They'll never recognize him
[1:20:13] until judgment would come and take them
[1:20:15] all away. Let me tell you this friends,
[1:20:17] but just like there was those that
[1:20:18] received judgment, there was those that
[1:20:20] went into the ark and accepted the word
[1:20:23] of God and believed on upon the name of
[1:20:26] their God and they and they and the
[1:20:28] Bible says that they were carried over
[1:20:30] the waters of judgment. And I'll say
[1:20:32] this today that just like there was in
[1:20:34] the days of Noah, there was a bunch of
[1:20:36] new knocks, a bunch of no knocks that
[1:20:38] didn't know the things of God. And I
[1:20:40] think there's a whole world full of nos.
[1:20:42] There's a a new nos that don't know the
[1:20:44] things of God. But I thank God that I'm
[1:20:46] sitting in a building this morning with
[1:20:48] a bunch of people that ain't no that
[1:20:50] there people that have the knowledge and
[1:20:52] the revelation of Jesus Christ in the
[1:20:54] age that they're living in.
[1:20:57] &gt;&gt; I think it's powerful. Amen.
[1:20:58] &gt;&gt; The Bible prophesies that there's coming
[1:21:00] a day, but then it prophesies there's a
[1:21:02] people that'll recognize the day
[1:21:04] &gt;&gt; by revelation. They'll recognize the day
[1:21:07] that they're living in. And you know
[1:21:08] what? There's going to come, can I just
[1:21:09] tell you what the Bible says? I I'll
[1:21:11] just paraphrase it. There's going to
[1:21:12] come in the last days a body of
[1:21:14] believers that'll be known as the bride
[1:21:16] of Jesus Christ. And she'll believe the
[1:21:18] word of God. And she'll she'll desire to
[1:21:21] be with him. And he'll not only will he
[1:21:23] be with her, but he'll he'll his spirit
[1:21:25] will be in her.
[1:21:26] &gt;&gt; And she'll recognize her age, she'll
[1:21:28] recognize her position. And when she
[1:21:30] recognizes, it's going to unleash a
[1:21:32] power on her that's beyond human
[1:21:34] understanding. It's a power that's
[1:21:36] beyond reasoning. It's a power that's
[1:21:38] beyond our feelings. It's a power that's
[1:21:40] beyond sickness. It's a power that's
[1:21:42] beyond death. Whenever she recognizes
[1:21:44] who she is, no wonder the devil didn't
[1:21:46] want you to recognize who you are. said,
[1:21:48] "Because he knows if the people get a
[1:21:50] true revelation of the true church and
[1:21:51] what she is and what she stands for and
[1:21:54] that she can do the greater works, she
[1:21:56] will be an invincible army." That's why
[1:21:58] the devil don't want you to recognize
[1:21:59] who you are and what you stand for. Cuz
[1:22:02] he don't want an invincible army. He
[1:22:04] wants somebody that he can put down and
[1:22:06] somebody he can walk on and somebody he
[1:22:08] can step all over and put you down today
[1:22:11] and drag you through the mud tomorrow.
[1:22:12] He don't want a son and daughter of God
[1:22:14] that can stand firm on the word of God
[1:22:16] and say, "I recognize who I am. I
[1:22:19] recognize where I came from. I recognize
[1:22:21] who my enemy is. And I've got power over
[1:22:24] you.
[1:22:25] &gt;&gt; God has made me invincible to the
[1:22:27] tactics of the devil because I recognize
[1:22:30] who I am."
[1:22:32] &gt;&gt; From recognizing who you are, just from
[1:22:34] getting a revelation of who she is and
[1:22:37] what she stands for. Friends, let me
[1:22:38] tell you, I think that's what we need
[1:22:40] this morning. Amen.
[1:22:41] &gt;&gt; A revelation of what you stand for.
[1:22:43] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[1:22:43] &gt;&gt; Can I ask you this? Don't take this the
[1:22:45] wrong way. I'm not asking any person.
[1:22:46] I'm just putting this out as a blanket
[1:22:48] statement.
[1:22:49] &gt;&gt; Do you stand for anything?
[1:22:51] &gt;&gt; Do you stand for anything?
[1:22:54] &gt;&gt; That's the question to ask the world.
[1:22:55] What do you really stand for?
[1:22:58] &gt;&gt; What standard? What do you There's all
[1:23:00] all kinds of things. People fight over
[1:23:02] all kinds of ideas, but what do you what
[1:23:03] do you really stand for? Is there some
[1:23:05] foundation of something that you could
[1:23:07] say, I want to take my stand here. I'm
[1:23:09] standing for this. This is something
[1:23:10] that I I believe that we ought to know
[1:23:12] what we stand for.
[1:23:13] &gt;&gt; Say, "Brother man, what is it?" Let me
[1:23:14] just tell you, we stand for Hebrews
[1:23:16] 13:8.
[1:23:17] &gt;&gt; Jesus Christ is the same yesterday,
[1:23:19] today, and forever. I stand for that. I
[1:23:22] stand for that in front of the world
[1:23:23] that would denounce him a as a as a a
[1:23:26] God that only a God that could create,
[1:23:28] that would send his son, that would die,
[1:23:30] that 2,000 years ago he would lose the
[1:23:33] power that he had and wouldn't have
[1:23:34] power today. But I stand for the power
[1:23:36] of God. I stand for the message of the
[1:23:38] hour. I stand for the word of God. I
[1:23:41] stand for the baptism of the Holy Ghost.
[1:23:43] I believe we have a right to stand for
[1:23:44] something.
[1:23:47] &gt;&gt; You got a right to stand for it.
[1:23:49] &gt;&gt; See, when when revelation comes, you
[1:23:51] notice what do you do? Well, you can
[1:23:53] just give thanks to God that you have a
[1:23:55] revelation
[1:23:56] &gt;&gt; because the Bible said the eyes of your
[1:23:58] understanding have been enlightened.
[1:24:01] &gt;&gt; So, when you get a revelation, your eyes
[1:24:03] have been enlightened by something.
[1:24:05] &gt;&gt; That's what that's what a revelation is.
[1:24:07] You realize it's a dark age that we live
[1:24:08] in. Hearts are failing. People won't
[1:24:11] hear the word. The blind the they're
[1:24:13] blinded to truth. But can I tell you
[1:24:14] what the Bible says? Bible said it'll be
[1:24:16] that way. They'll be blind. They won't
[1:24:18] be able to receive truth. It'll be far
[1:24:20] away from them. But the prophet said,
[1:24:22] "But but in that day the deaf shall hear
[1:24:25] the words of the book, and the eyes of
[1:24:27] the blind shall see out of obscurity and
[1:24:29] out of darkness." I I don't know about
[1:24:30] you, friend, but I realize we're living
[1:24:32] in a dark age where people are deaf to
[1:24:34] the word of God, and they're blind to
[1:24:36] the things of God. But I thank God that
[1:24:38] there was a word in there for you and me
[1:24:40] that said, "But in that day, the deaf
[1:24:42] shall hear the words of the book, and
[1:24:43] the eyes of the blind shall see out of
[1:24:45] obscurity and out of darkness." I thank
[1:24:47] God that our eyes have became open that
[1:24:50] we shall know him, and we should see him
[1:24:52] in the power of his resurrection.
[1:24:55] &gt;&gt; He said, "How will we know him?" Said,
[1:24:57] "We know him by his nature. He does his
[1:25:00] work. He said Jesus said, "I am the vine
[1:25:01] and you are the branches." He said, "The
[1:25:03] branch bears fruit, not the vine. It's
[1:25:06] the branch that bears fruit."
[1:25:08] &gt;&gt; Jesus said, "I am the vine. You're the
[1:25:09] branches." The branch bears fruit. He
[1:25:11] said, "So the vine energizes the branch.
[1:25:14] And if that vine, you think about
[1:25:15] talking about the church." He said, "If
[1:25:17] that vine brings forth a branch and it
[1:25:19] has grapes on it, well then whenever
[1:25:21] that vine puts out another branch, what
[1:25:22] do you think it's going to put out?
[1:25:24] &gt;&gt; It's going to make grapes because the
[1:25:26] branch comes from the life of the vine."
[1:25:28] says, "So if the first church, Jesus
[1:25:30] said, I'm the vine." If the first church
[1:25:32] that come off of that vine was a
[1:25:34] Pentecostal church with all the gifts
[1:25:36] that ever really puts out another, if it
[1:25:38] ever really puts out another branch,
[1:25:39] they'll write another book of Acts
[1:25:41] behind it because that's what they had
[1:25:42] in the days of the apostles. And that a
[1:25:45] apostolic age has never ended. Are you
[1:25:47] hearing me? If if that's what the vine
[1:25:49] put out 2,000 years ago, if it puts out
[1:25:51] another branch in the year 2025, it'll
[1:25:54] be the same thing that'll produce as it
[1:25:56] did 2,000 years ago.
[1:25:59] &gt;&gt; Said, see, the apostolic age is never
[1:26:01] end. I know the church world don't
[1:26:02] preach that.
[1:26:03] &gt;&gt; They preach that the apostolic age is
[1:26:05] over. I've had that conversation with
[1:26:06] many denominational pastors. The
[1:26:08] apostolic age was just for the apostles
[1:26:10] and miracles were done only in the the
[1:26:12] disciples hands. It was only handed down
[1:26:15] from Jesus to the disciples. And that's
[1:26:16] as far as it went. And that that that
[1:26:19] power wasn't handed down through
[1:26:20] generations. I thought, well, you know,
[1:26:22] that may be become a a good sermon for a
[1:26:24] lot of denominational churches, but it
[1:26:26] certainly wasn't the sermon that Peter
[1:26:27] preached on the day of Pentecost. He
[1:26:29] said, "But repent every one of you in
[1:26:31] the name of Jesus Christ and be baptized
[1:26:33] for the remission of your sins, and you
[1:26:35] shall receive the gift of the Holy
[1:26:37] Ghost." And this promise is to you and
[1:26:40] to your children, and to them that are a
[1:26:41] far off, as many as the Lord our God
[1:26:44] shall call.
[1:26:45] That's the sermon that Peter preached.
[1:26:48] &gt;&gt; Said, "As long as God is still calling,
[1:26:50] then the apostolic age is still going
[1:26:52] on."
[1:26:53] &gt;&gt; For the promise, just like it was made
[1:26:54] then is to you and to your children as
[1:26:57] many as God shall call. So I say that
[1:26:59] this morning, for our sake and for our
[1:27:01] children's sake, I believe that God is
[1:27:03] still calling.
[1:27:05] &gt;&gt; I wonder how many can witness. Raise
[1:27:06] your hand. Say, I believe God is still
[1:27:08] calling. How are you a witness of it?
[1:27:10] Because you heard the call of God and
[1:27:12] you responded to the call of God.
[1:27:15] said, "Well, what's the call of God
[1:27:16] sound like?" Can I just tell you
[1:27:19] &gt;&gt; what's the call of God sound like? I'll
[1:27:20] tell you what it is. It's a draw in your
[1:27:23] heart.
[1:27:24] &gt;&gt; It's a pull in your heart. Maybe when
[1:27:26] you was a young girl, young boy that you
[1:27:28] felt the little tug in your heart that
[1:27:30] when when you would go to do something
[1:27:32] that was wrong and you knew it was wrong
[1:27:34] and then all of a sudden something would
[1:27:35] pull you. What was that? It certainly
[1:27:37] wasn't the devil. The devil ain't never
[1:27:38] pulled anybody to do right. It was the
[1:27:40] spirit of the Lord drawing you. You see,
[1:27:43] it's a it's a draw in your heart. It's
[1:27:44] not a force or a push. It's a draw. It's
[1:27:47] an attraction to you. Remember remember
[1:27:48] whenever Jesus was preaching at
[1:27:50] Capernium, he he said he was on earth to
[1:27:52] do the father's will and there was some
[1:27:54] that would cross seas to hang on every
[1:27:56] word he said. And others they they said
[1:27:58] he was just a carpenter son. But Jesus
[1:28:00] said, "But no man can come to me unless
[1:28:02] the father would draw him first."
[1:28:05] &gt;&gt; You notice does that not preach
[1:28:06] predestination?
[1:28:08] Unless the father would draw him first
[1:28:09] and I will raise him up in the last day.
[1:28:12] &gt;&gt; See, so he shows us that there's a great
[1:28:14] spirit that's doing the drawing.
[1:28:16] &gt;&gt; And here on earth, he was the image of
[1:28:18] that spirit.
[1:28:19] &gt;&gt; Said he was the image of an invisible
[1:28:21] God.
[1:28:22] &gt;&gt; But then watch what Jesus does. He turns
[1:28:24] around in John 12. First he says this
[1:28:26] causes confusion in the church world.
[1:28:27] The father unless the father would draw
[1:28:29] him. But then in John 12 he makes this
[1:28:31] plain. When the Bible says it would it
[1:28:33] would be the hour that the son of man
[1:28:35] would be glorified. Watch how Jesus says
[1:28:37] it. He said, "When I am lifted up, I
[1:28:40] will draw all men unto me."
[1:28:43] &gt;&gt; Say, "So, who's doing the drawing?" It's
[1:28:44] that same great spirit that was in the
[1:28:47] man, the flesh, Jesus Christ, which was
[1:28:49] the son of God. But it was that same
[1:28:51] God. You realize that everything God was
[1:28:53] was poured out into that flesh. All that
[1:28:55] God was was in that man. That's why the
[1:28:57] Bible said there ain't no other name in
[1:28:59] heaven or in earth that is above that
[1:29:01] name. It's the greatest name. We worship
[1:29:03] in that name. We baptize in that name.
[1:29:05] We serve God in the name of Jesus
[1:29:07] Christ. We recognize who he is.
[1:29:09] &gt;&gt; All that God was was poured out into the
[1:29:11] man Jesus Christ. It's the greatest
[1:29:12] revelation that you could ever get. It's
[1:29:14] the supreme deity of Jesus Christ.
[1:29:18] &gt;&gt; Know who it is you serve.
[1:29:20] &gt;&gt; He said, "When I be lifted up, I will
[1:29:21] draw.
[1:29:22] &gt;&gt; All men unto me." I don't think he was
[1:29:24] switching it up. Said, "Well, first it
[1:29:26] was the father. Now I'm now I'm going to
[1:29:28] do it." It was the same spirit
[1:29:30] &gt;&gt; that was doing the drawing. And let me
[1:29:31] tell you this today, that same spirit is
[1:29:33] still drawing
[1:29:35] &gt;&gt; cuz Jesus said, "I will send one unto
[1:29:36] you." Remember the comforter. I will
[1:29:38] come to you in the form of the Holy
[1:29:40] Ghost. You see who it was? It was Jesus
[1:29:42] Christ that was glorified. You realize
[1:29:44] that's what it is today. It's a spirit
[1:29:46] that draws us to God.
[1:29:48] &gt;&gt; It's not something you can see with your
[1:29:49] natural eye.
[1:29:50] &gt;&gt; It's a spiritual thing. It's the spirit
[1:29:52] of God that's dealing with a heart.
[1:29:54] &gt;&gt; Preachers preach words, but God deals
[1:29:57] with hearts.
[1:29:58] &gt;&gt; I can't draw you to something. I
[1:30:00] couldn't pull you to something. Only you
[1:30:02] can say that there's a draw on your
[1:30:03] heart or pull in your heart for
[1:30:05] something else. That there's something
[1:30:07] that this that in this life that you've
[1:30:09] never found satisfaction. You've never
[1:30:11] been satisfied, but there's something
[1:30:13] there's something there's a hunger and a
[1:30:14] thirst in you.
[1:30:16] &gt;&gt; Say, what is it? There's something
[1:30:17] drawing you.
[1:30:22] &gt;&gt; The Bible tells us in the days of
[1:30:25] Solomon, Solomon was a great man.
[1:30:28] &gt;&gt; Yes. remember
[1:30:30] a great king, one of the greatest that
[1:30:32] there ever was, the greatest wealthiest
[1:30:34] man that ever lived upon the face of the
[1:30:36] earth. But not only was he great in in
[1:30:39] in the natural, but as a spiritual man,
[1:30:42] he had the wisdom of God.
[1:30:43] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:30:44] &gt;&gt; And the Bible tells us of a story that
[1:30:47] there was a queen that was down in the
[1:30:48] south,
[1:30:49] &gt;&gt; the Queen of Sheba.
[1:30:51] &gt;&gt; So she was a heathen. She was an idol
[1:30:53] worshipper. She was she uh you know they
[1:30:56] had those great gods like Deegon and all
[1:30:58] that
[1:30:58] &gt;&gt; said but but but somebody had to come by
[1:31:00] there one day and talk to her about what
[1:31:04] was going on in Israel.
[1:31:06] &gt;&gt; So one day maybe somebody would come by
[1:31:08] and they say you know I passed through
[1:31:10] the land of of Israel and you know we
[1:31:12] were down there you know on our on our
[1:31:13] journey and we stopped in and bought
[1:31:15] some things and and you know you you
[1:31:17] should see that country. You should see
[1:31:19] what kind of a meeting that they have up
[1:31:21] there. You ought to see what kind of
[1:31:22] people that they are up in Israel. You
[1:31:24] ought to see the kind of church services
[1:31:25] they have over in Israel and they and
[1:31:27] they got to testifying about the God of
[1:31:30] Israel and the and the and the man
[1:31:32] Solomon in Israel and how you know they
[1:31:34] they're they all have such great
[1:31:36] meetings and there's such wonderful
[1:31:37] unity in their God. is so alive in their
[1:31:40] midst and and you know you know they got
[1:31:41] a they got a God up there they called
[1:31:43] Jehovah and and Jehovah has a man in in
[1:31:46] in the office up there that he works
[1:31:48] through and and and he and he helps his
[1:31:50] people and he's vindicated himself right
[1:31:52] in the presence of those people.
[1:31:54] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:31:55] &gt;&gt; Said it must have been a great talk
[1:31:57] because something in her heart began to
[1:32:01] desire to go meet Solomon.
[1:32:04] &gt;&gt; So see what was it? said, "These people
[1:32:05] saying that way down in the heart of
[1:32:07] this little queen," she began to wonder,
[1:32:08] "Well, I wonder if all that's really
[1:32:10] so." So, well, you know, waited till the
[1:32:12] next camel caravan came by. When they
[1:32:14] came by, maybe she went out there and
[1:32:16] asked them, "Has anybody gone by Israel?
[1:32:17] Have you have anybody anybody?" Yeah.
[1:32:19] Yeah. We came through Israel. Well, what
[1:32:21] was it like over in Israel? And they get
[1:32:22] to talk. Well, you know what? It's a
[1:32:24] great kingdom. They they have a they
[1:32:26] have a great palaces and and my how how
[1:32:28] they come. There's such wonderful order
[1:32:30] and they love their king and their and
[1:32:32] their king loves his God and their God
[1:32:34] is so alive among them. They got to
[1:32:36] talking about the supernatural and the
[1:32:37] things that took place in Israel until
[1:32:39] all of a sudden she couldn't help it
[1:32:40] anymore.
[1:32:41] &gt;&gt; You say, "Well, what caused a desire for
[1:32:43] the Queen of Sheba to meet Solomon?" It
[1:32:45] was a testimony that she heard.
[1:32:48] &gt;&gt; Think about it. It was just a testimony.
[1:32:49] She had to hear it from somebody.
[1:32:51] &gt;&gt; So for her to have a desire to go down
[1:32:53] there and meet him, somebody had to tell
[1:32:55] a testimony about what was going on in
[1:32:57] Israel. So when somebody told her about
[1:32:59] it, they told her about the God of
[1:33:00] Israel, they told her about this great
[1:33:02] Solomon and God, God's man, and then,
[1:33:04] you know, she'd sit there and think
[1:33:05] about and say, "Well, did you see the
[1:33:07] man they got up there?" "Yeah, we did."
[1:33:08] "Did you did you meet Solomon?" "Yeah,
[1:33:10] we saw him from a far off." "Well, is it
[1:33:12] true that they've got a God that makes
[1:33:13] himself known among his people?" "Oh,
[1:33:15] yeah, it's true." "Does he have the
[1:33:16] wisdom of a God?" "Yeah, he has a wisdom
[1:33:19] of a He knows things that men can't even
[1:33:21] explain. He knows things that happen in
[1:33:23] people's life, things that are going to
[1:33:24] take place in their life." Well, how
[1:33:26] would a man be able to know that? I
[1:33:28] don't know. It must be a god.
[1:33:30] &gt;&gt; And as they begin to tell her, said all
[1:33:32] of a sudden, her little heart began to
[1:33:33] beat. So, I think about what she would
[1:33:36] start, he said, we would start. Her
[1:33:38] heart begin to beat because somebody was
[1:33:39] telling her. She said, "But what if we
[1:33:40] would start telling people that stuff
[1:33:42] about our own people?
[1:33:43] &gt;&gt; What if we went to telling people how
[1:33:45] good our people were and how great our
[1:33:47] God was in our midst and how wonderful
[1:33:49] the Holy Ghost is instead of trying to
[1:33:51] run one another down?" He said, "What do
[1:33:52] you think it would do? It would cause
[1:33:54] people to want to be around
[1:33:55] He said, "You're the the Bible said
[1:33:57] you're the salt of the earth, but a salt
[1:33:59] can only it can only flavor if it
[1:34:01] contacts." You're the salt of the earth,
[1:34:03] but the salt can't do no good. It can't
[1:34:05] say unless it makes contact with the
[1:34:07] meat. See, so if you're the salt of the
[1:34:09] earth, you have to make contact in order
[1:34:11] for in order for it to be able to say.
[1:34:14] &gt;&gt; Let me tell you what happened. He says,
[1:34:15] "So what we have to be I think we need
[1:34:17] to just get real salty. And if we'll get
[1:34:19] salty, the world will get thirsty
[1:34:21] &gt;&gt; and then God's kingdom will grow." I
[1:34:22] believe that this morning. That's what
[1:34:24] happened. that somebody in the land of
[1:34:26] Sheba had got salty and they came
[1:34:28] through Israel and they're a little bit
[1:34:29] salty and they got to talking about the
[1:34:31] things of God and the things that they
[1:34:33] seen in the supernatural and testify
[1:34:35] about the mighty worship of God and how
[1:34:37] that God come through the gift of
[1:34:39] discernment and use this great man
[1:34:41] Solomon and all of a sudden because they
[1:34:42] were salty this queen of Sheba she got
[1:34:45] real thirsty I thought isn't it
[1:34:47] something that it put a thirst in a
[1:34:48] woman that had everything she was of
[1:34:50] great wealth I I know y'all's tired she
[1:34:52] was a great wealth music player should
[1:34:53] come God bless But she was a she was a
[1:34:55] great wealth. She had everything uh in
[1:34:58] the billions of dollars in our in our
[1:35:00] money. Great gold, great wealth, great
[1:35:02] ca castles, cathedrals, homes. She you'd
[1:35:04] think she never wanted for nothing.
[1:35:07] &gt;&gt; But because somebody was somebody was a
[1:35:09] little salty, she got thirsted for
[1:35:11] something else. You say, "What was it?"
[1:35:12] It was a draw in her heart. I thought,
[1:35:15] "Isn't that something?" It was the soft
[1:35:17] that put the draw there. Even they may
[1:35:19] not even know they were ever used. You
[1:35:21] know, their testimony is not in the
[1:35:22] Bible. the person that introduced the
[1:35:24] Queen of Sheba to the thoughts of
[1:35:26] Solomon or Israel. Their testimony is
[1:35:28] not even written in the scripture. You
[1:35:30] don't even know who they were that told
[1:35:31] her about it. But somebody had to tell
[1:35:33] her in order for her to know. And let me
[1:35:35] tell you, they may not they may be an
[1:35:37] unknown. They may not be nothing written
[1:35:39] about them. They may be just a little
[1:35:40] bit of nobody, but it was somebody that
[1:35:42] was salty enough to tell a testimony
[1:35:44] about what was going on in the kingdom
[1:35:46] of God.
[1:35:48] &gt;&gt; And it turned an entire nation towards
[1:35:50] God. Hallelujah.
[1:35:51] &gt;&gt; Cuz some little nobody that's not even
[1:35:53] written about, that's not even mentioned
[1:35:54] of was used of God to go into the land
[1:35:57] of Sheba and tell about the greatness of
[1:35:59] Solomon
[1:36:01] &gt;&gt; and Jehovah.
[1:36:03] &gt;&gt; And that little nobody that done their
[1:36:06] job. I think one day we'll meet them
[1:36:07] over on the other side.
[1:36:09] &gt;&gt; They're going to give us the name. Who
[1:36:10] are you?
[1:36:12] &gt;&gt; Well, you didn't read about me. Wasn't
[1:36:14] important.
[1:36:16] But I was, you know, I just I'm just
[1:36:19] preaching. Come on.
[1:36:20] &gt;&gt; You know, I worked for the Queen of
[1:36:22] Sheba and I heard a testimony.
[1:36:24] &gt;&gt; The people that came through Israel one
[1:36:26] day
[1:36:27] &gt;&gt; and it fell on my ears. You know, I got
[1:36:30] to think about all of our gods,
[1:36:32] &gt;&gt; great idols that we had in our kingdom,
[1:36:35] great God, day god, how many nights I
[1:36:38] had watched our queen and the leaders of
[1:36:41] our country and they would lay prostrate
[1:36:43] before these great gods, hoping that a
[1:36:46] spirit would come from that idol and
[1:36:49] anoint them and feeling like that the
[1:36:52] words that they thought from their own
[1:36:53] mind came from that God, that it was a
[1:36:55] spirit that came on it. But then I
[1:36:57] watched how Many times we would stand
[1:37:00] and it wouldn't defend us. And many
[1:37:01] times it would never rise up. It never
[1:37:03] had a voice. It never spoke. It never
[1:37:06] helped.
[1:37:07] But then I heard of the God of
[1:37:09] &gt;&gt; Israel
[1:37:11] &gt;&gt; and how that he would anoint the king to
[1:37:14] come down and he could look at a
[1:37:16] person's life and tell them something
[1:37:18] that was going on in their life that
[1:37:20] nobody else knew about. And when I heard
[1:37:23] about the God of Israel that had the
[1:37:24] ability to do that and something in my
[1:37:27] heart began to think about our queen,
[1:37:30] you know, she's never stood there and
[1:37:32] told people the things they were
[1:37:33] thinking. Our queen, our leaders have
[1:37:36] never stood there and told people the
[1:37:38] desires that was on their heart and
[1:37:39] desert their heart in that way.
[1:37:43] And we long
[1:37:45] for a reality.
[1:37:48] &gt;&gt; You know, I
[1:37:50] couldn't help myself. told the queen.
[1:37:53] &gt;&gt; There's a God that's real.
[1:37:56] &gt;&gt; I'm just going to say it like it is.
[1:37:57] There's a lot of churches. There's a lot
[1:37:58] of a lot of beliefs, but there's a God
[1:38:00] that's real.
[1:38:03] &gt;&gt; We ain't trying to get prestige. We
[1:38:05] ain't trying to build a great name,
[1:38:06] build some great church. We just want to
[1:38:09] know God.
[1:38:11] &gt;&gt; A God that's real.
[1:38:14] They told her about it.
[1:38:17] Reb said, "When God goes tugging at your
[1:38:19] heart," he said, "the ain't hardly
[1:38:20] anything that can keep you away from
[1:38:21] him."
[1:38:22] &gt;&gt; It ain't a man tugging, it's God.
[1:38:25] &gt;&gt; And when God goes tugging at your heart,
[1:38:28] said, "You know what she did? Listen,
[1:38:29] this queen,
[1:38:32] wonderful lady,
[1:38:34] this queen,
[1:38:36] finally her heart got to a place she
[1:38:40] says, you know,
[1:38:42] I think I'll just go find out for
[1:38:44] myself."
[1:38:46] Amen.
[1:38:47] &gt;&gt; She heard enough testimonies about what
[1:38:49] a God had done for somebody's life. And
[1:38:52] I wonder how many of us have been in
[1:38:54] that same place.
[1:38:56] I think I'll find out for myself. He
[1:38:57] said, "That's a good thing. You ought to
[1:38:59] make your choice. When something begins
[1:39:01] to be or begins to thirst, it's time to
[1:39:04] go hunting. You might think I may die
[1:39:06] one of these days and I don't know God."
[1:39:07] He said, "Well, you better get started."
[1:39:09] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:39:09] &gt;&gt; That's God's red light. It's a sign of
[1:39:11] his coming. You better know God.
[1:39:15] You know what she found
[1:39:17] &gt;&gt; when she finally worked up the courage?
[1:39:20] She didn't care about, you know, can you
[1:39:21] imagine all the people around her that
[1:39:24] tried to keep her from making this
[1:39:26] journey? Don't do that. Don't take that
[1:39:29] step. Don't watch how the devil does
[1:39:31] today. Don't take that step. Don't don't
[1:39:34] don't take that walk. You know, you know
[1:39:37] what the rest of the nations say about
[1:39:39] Israel?
[1:39:40] They don't even they they they are a
[1:39:43] bunch of oh holy roller bunch of people
[1:39:46] and
[1:39:47] &gt;&gt; you know what the nations say about them
[1:39:49] don't follow after that don't go down
[1:39:51] there
[1:39:53] but something in her heart was draw your
[1:39:57] so she went she brought the gifts of
[1:39:59] gold and silver and garments of clothing
[1:40:04] camel train loaded with gifts and she
[1:40:07] came and laid it out down at Solomon's
[1:40:10] feet
[1:40:12] thought, "My, isn't it something here?"
[1:40:13] Even a queen, she showed her wisdom
[1:40:15] right there. She may not been known for
[1:40:18] wisdom, but she showed wisdom when she
[1:40:20] came before a god of wisdom
[1:40:22] &gt;&gt; and laid her gifts at his feet and said,
[1:40:24] "This is what I have to offer. I brought
[1:40:26] everything I could pack, all the camels
[1:40:29] I could get, everything I could carry."
[1:40:32] When she got down there, she found
[1:40:34] Israel was a god-fearing nation. She
[1:40:37] found a God that was real. She saw a
[1:40:40] gift of discernment. You realize the
[1:40:41] historians say today that Solomon told
[1:40:43] her things about her that were hidden in
[1:40:45] her life. Things that was actually about
[1:40:47] her physical body that were covered up
[1:40:50] that no one else knew. But in the
[1:40:52] presence of Solomon, he told her things
[1:40:53] on her body that nobody else knew about.
[1:40:56] Isn't that powerful? You know what she
[1:40:58] saw? She saw a gift of God working in
[1:41:01] his life. The Bible says Solomon told
[1:41:03] her all of her questions. Isn't that
[1:41:05] wonderful? He told her all of her
[1:41:07] questions
[1:41:08] and there was nothing hid from Solomon
[1:41:10] which he told her not. While she was
[1:41:13] looking for a reality,
[1:41:15] &gt;&gt; her heart was drawn to him. Notice what
[1:41:16] her response was. She said to the king,
[1:41:19] she said, "It was a true report what I
[1:41:21] heard about you." And you know what?
[1:41:23] I'll just say this that until I came
[1:41:26] here and my eyes saw it, only half, not
[1:41:29] even half of the greatness that was told
[1:41:31] about you, I've experienced.
[1:41:34] You've exceeded the fame that I have
[1:41:36] heard. Now, isn't that quite a
[1:41:38] testimony? I wonder how many can say
[1:41:40] that this morning
[1:41:42] that I heard testimonies about a real
[1:41:44] God.
[1:41:45] &gt;&gt; The reality of what God could do in a
[1:41:47] life,
[1:41:48] &gt;&gt; but my personal experience was greater
[1:41:50] than any story that I ever heard.
[1:41:52] &gt;&gt; I wonder how many could tell it. I heard
[1:41:54] that he could heal and it was wonderful
[1:41:58] &gt;&gt; until he did.
[1:42:00] &gt;&gt; I heard that he could save. I thought,
[1:42:02] "Well, that's wonderful until he did."
[1:42:05] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:42:06] &gt;&gt; I heard he could deliver. Isn't it
[1:42:08] wonderful? Until he did.
[1:42:10] &gt;&gt; And my experience was greater. It
[1:42:13] exceeded the fame that I have heard
[1:42:15] about him. And friends, I tell you that
[1:42:17] this morning,
[1:42:18] &gt;&gt; my experience with God is far greater
[1:42:20] than any testimony that anybody could
[1:42:22] tell me about the works of God.
[1:42:26] &gt;&gt; I've heard about it.
[1:42:28] And finally, my experience is greater.
[1:42:32] Friends, I don't believe that any
[1:42:34] Christian
[1:42:36] should have to look back to see God.
[1:42:39] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:42:39] &gt;&gt; I don't think they would have to look
[1:42:41] backwards to see a move of God. I I
[1:42:43] don't think we should have to look
[1:42:44] backwards to see a revival. We shouldn't
[1:42:46] have to look backwards to see healing.
[1:42:48] We shouldn't have to look back to see
[1:42:50] the supernatural.
[1:42:52] &gt;&gt; It should be present among us.
[1:42:53] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[1:42:54] &gt;&gt; Listen what a prophet said. He said,
[1:42:56] "And truly, can you hear this this
[1:42:59] morning?" All of her questions answered,
[1:43:02] heart's desire was given to her. Her
[1:43:05] needs were met. Experience was greater
[1:43:08] than the testimony she heard. He said,
[1:43:10] "But truly a greater than Solomon is
[1:43:13] here."
[1:43:14] &gt;&gt; He said, "A greater than any of the
[1:43:16] prophets is here." There's no prophet
[1:43:18] that ever walked upon the face of the
[1:43:20] earth as great as the one that is
[1:43:22] standing in our midst this morning. He
[1:43:24] said, "For the Holy Spirit is here, the
[1:43:26] gift of God that he gave to the world."
[1:43:29] Friends, don't you realize it's the
[1:43:30] spirit of God that discerns the hearts
[1:43:33] by the word. It was that same spirit
[1:43:34] that stood there in the flesh of a man
[1:43:37] that discerned people's hearts. You
[1:43:38] realize that same spirit according to
[1:43:40] the word. The Bible said the word of God
[1:43:42] is a discerner of the thoughts and the
[1:43:43] intents of our heart. That that same
[1:43:45] spirit of God is discerning our hearts
[1:43:47] this morning.
[1:43:49] &gt;&gt; And that spirit that's moving around
[1:43:50] this building knows what we need to
[1:43:52] hear. It's what's drawing us. Won't you
[1:43:55] stand to your feet this morning? And
[1:43:57] it's the Holy Spirit that's pulling at
[1:43:59] our heart. The Holy Spirit that anoints
[1:44:01] the word of God that brings it to life.
[1:44:04] The Bible said, "He that hath an ear."
[1:44:08] Let me just give it a finish. He that
[1:44:10] hath an ear, let him hear what the
[1:44:13] spirit saith.
[1:44:16] &gt;&gt; It's the spirit that's calling us.
[1:44:18] &gt;&gt; The spirit of God. I wonder how many has
[1:44:20] an ear to hear. They can say, "I
[1:44:23] recognize God."
[1:44:24] &gt;&gt; I may not be the smartest man in the in
[1:44:27] the world, but there's one thing I know.
[1:44:30] I know God
[1:44:31] &gt;&gt; and I know he created me. And I know
[1:44:33] that he called me. That el Elohim, that
[1:44:36] great creator, he made me and he formed
[1:44:38] me. And he's called me to fulfill his
[1:44:40] purpose.
[1:44:42] And I want to manifest him. Lord, let me
[1:44:45] be salty this morning
[1:44:47] &gt;&gt; that somebody might be thirsty.
[1:44:49] &gt;&gt; Let me manifest a life of Christ. I
[1:44:51] don't care about your past.
[1:44:53] &gt;&gt; I don't care about where you came from
[1:44:55] or who raised you or what kind of
[1:44:56] environment you grow up in or or what
[1:44:58] kind of people or what theology they
[1:44:59] had. I don't care nothing about
[1:45:01] yesterday.
[1:45:02] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:45:02] &gt;&gt; I'm here to talk about tomorrow.
[1:45:05] &gt;&gt; God can take a young man, an old man, a
[1:45:08] young woman, an old mo old old woman.
[1:45:10] God can take us and mold us
[1:45:12] &gt;&gt; into the image that he wants us to be.
[1:45:15] &gt;&gt; God can take a life. I was a wreck of a
[1:45:17] life. Friends, if you if you could go
[1:45:20] back and run around with me for a few
[1:45:21] years, you wouldn't have any confidence
[1:45:23] in me if you looked at my flesh.
[1:45:25] &gt;&gt; I was a failure. I was a wreck when it
[1:45:28] come to serving God and the things of
[1:45:30] God. I I was an unbeliever.
[1:45:32] &gt;&gt; Come on now.
[1:45:34] &gt;&gt; You wouldn't have no confidence in me.
[1:45:36] And I can tell you this one thing. Many
[1:45:39] people, they told me, "If you can ever
[1:45:41] get a hold of God, he'll change your
[1:45:42] life.
[1:45:44] &gt;&gt; If you'll ever get a hold of God and God
[1:45:46] get a hold of you, it'll change your
[1:45:47] family. It'll change the history of your
[1:45:49] family, the story that's written about
[1:45:51] your family, it'll all be changed. What
[1:45:54] people tell about you, it'll be changed.
[1:45:56] The testimony about you, it'll be
[1:45:57] another testimony. And one of these
[1:46:00] days, all of that old stuff, they won't
[1:46:01] even talk about it no more. God will use
[1:46:04] you.
[1:46:05] &gt;&gt; Somebody told me that he can change you.
[1:46:08] He can use you. And you know what I
[1:46:09] found out, brother Robbie? The
[1:46:12] experience was greater than the
[1:46:14] testimony. Amen.
[1:46:15] &gt;&gt; When I met God face to face, the
[1:46:17] experience when somebody says God loves
[1:46:19] you and you say, "Well, that's
[1:46:20] wonderful. I need a God to love me." But
[1:46:22] when you experience the love of God,
[1:46:24] it's greater than anybody
[1:46:26] &gt;&gt; that could tell you about God's love.
[1:46:28] That God, he can heal you. The
[1:46:30] experience is far greater than anybody
[1:46:32] that could tell you about being healed.
[1:46:34] When you see the supernatural power of
[1:46:36] God drop into your life and take the
[1:46:39] symptoms out of your life and something
[1:46:41] that the doctor would say that's going
[1:46:42] to be there forever and God can remove
[1:46:44] it in just a matter of moments.
[1:46:47] The experience is far greater.
[1:46:50] Just bow your heads with me this
[1:46:52] morning. Maybe you just lift your hand.
[1:46:54] Say, "Brother man,
[1:46:57] that's the kind of experience that I
[1:46:58] want."
[1:47:00] God bless you, brothers, sisters.
[1:47:03] God bless you. He sees our hands this
[1:47:04] morning. That's the kind of experience.
[1:47:07] I don't want to just know the
[1:47:09] testimonies of what God has done
[1:47:12] and the stories of the mighty things
[1:47:14] that God has done and the people that
[1:47:16] that he's healed and saved and and used.
[1:47:20] But I want to know God by experience.
[1:47:23] God bless you, brother. I wonder if you
[1:47:25] say, "Lord, Lord, let me just know you."
[1:47:27] How many feels the presence of the Lord
[1:47:29] this morning? Maybe something that's
[1:47:31] pulling at your heart and say, "Well, I
[1:47:33] don't know what it is." I can tell you
[1:47:34] what it is. It's the spirit of the Lord
[1:47:38] that he's drawing your heart to have an
[1:47:41] experience with him, something
[1:47:43] supernatural.
[1:47:45] You've heard about it your whole life.
[1:47:46] You say, "Well, what did I do?" You do
[1:47:48] what that queen did. Can I talk to you a
[1:47:51] minute?
[1:47:53] Little queen, you've heard, you've saw
[1:47:56] so much. You've heard the stories,
[1:47:59] but you lack an experience.
[1:48:02] Is it worth a move for God to move in
[1:48:06] your life and to move into your heart
[1:48:08] like his? Is it worth a move back and
[1:48:10] say, "God, that's what if that's you
[1:48:12] really calling, I'll just find out if it
[1:48:14] is. If that's you really drawing me,
[1:48:16] I'll just find out if it is.
[1:48:19] I'll just go see for myself."
[1:48:22] Maybe just lift your hand. Lift your
[1:48:23] heart. God bless you, brother. God bless
[1:48:26] you, sis.
[1:48:29] A real experience.
[1:48:32] I want you to speak to me. You know, you
[1:48:36] just really need that.
[1:48:39] If not, your life will have no meaning.
[1:48:41] You'll leave this life in a few years.
[1:48:44] You'll have never had any meaning, no
[1:48:46] purpose. The emptiness that you feel
[1:48:48] will follow you to your grave.
[1:48:51] that you can have an experience
[1:48:54] that your testimony will change. You'll
[1:48:56] lead souls to God for the greatness of
[1:49:00] what God is doing in your life
[1:49:03] right now, this moment. I don't know
[1:49:04] what you came for this morning. I don't
[1:49:07] believe it was an accident. Somebody's
[1:49:10] was salty and you're thirsty.
[1:49:14] Lord, you see our thirst this morning.
[1:49:18] Lord, we've testified of your greatness,
[1:49:21] of the mighty works of God that's been
[1:49:23] done in our midst. Lord, I look around
[1:49:26] this room.
[1:49:27] God, my faith is so strengthened
[1:49:31] by the many testimonies that I see
[1:49:33] sitting in this building,
[1:49:35] God. Lives that have been changed
[1:49:37] forever,
[1:49:39] God. people that had served the devil so
[1:49:41] long. Lord, the world had pulled at
[1:49:43] them, destroyed their lives and their
[1:49:45] families, their marriages and their
[1:49:46] homes, the wrecks of lives that they
[1:49:49] lived.
[1:49:51] But Lord, then an experience came, Lord.
[1:49:54] You drew in their heart, Lord, and they
[1:49:55] met you, Lord. And we've got to witness
[1:49:57] the testimonies of the experience of God
[1:50:00] in somebody's life, Lord. There was an
[1:50:02] alcoholic that that the spirit of
[1:50:04] alcoholism was taken out of their taken
[1:50:07] out of their life. drug addicts that
[1:50:09] that the desire was taken from them,
[1:50:13] prostitutes and wrecked up lives and
[1:50:16] broken up marriages, God, that you've
[1:50:18] mended. Lord, we're looking at great
[1:50:20] testimonies
[1:50:22] of the Holy Ghost that's been moving in
[1:50:24] our midst, Lord. Many hands that's been
[1:50:28] raised this morning, Lord, that are
[1:50:30] testifying of a great experience that
[1:50:33] they've had with you. And Lord, here are
[1:50:36] those that are longing for that very
[1:50:38] thing.
[1:50:39] Lord, here set your queen.
[1:50:43] Lord, she's brought her gifts to you,
[1:50:46] God, to surrender them to you. All that
[1:50:48] she has to offer,
[1:50:50] Lord. The world may look at her as just
[1:50:52] some other person or maybe a nobody. But
[1:50:56] Lord, I know how you see her as a queen
[1:50:59] of heaven.
[1:51:01] Lord, and you've drawn her to this place
[1:51:04] to hear the words of life. God, may she
[1:51:07] have such an experience. Lord, may she
[1:51:09] leave this place today, God. This queen
[1:51:12] of heaven, God, knowing that this
[1:51:15] experience is a real thing that she met
[1:51:18] you, Lord, God, that she seen you move.
[1:51:21] She heard you speak to her heart and
[1:51:22] discern things that was in her life that
[1:51:24] no man would even know.
[1:51:27] I may that be her testimony today.
[1:51:31] Oh, we thank you Lord. We love you.
[1:51:35] Thank you for all you do for us in Jesus
[1:51:37] name.
[1:51:58] All the earth.
[1:52:06] [Music]
[1:52:20] &gt;&gt; Having us sing it this morning.
[1:52:22] How great
[1:52:25] it is.
[1:52:26] We met her song when she left the palace
[1:52:29] of Solomon
[1:52:32] is our God.
[1:52:35] Oh, we see he how great,
[1:52:39] how great.
[1:52:42] The Bible tells us that she went back
[1:52:44] into her own land and she took home the
[1:52:47] God of Israel.
[1:52:50] Took home the God Jehovah, the idols out
[1:52:53] of her land. You know, one of the
[1:52:55] greatest things that about the
[1:52:56] excavations of Israel was here just a
[1:52:58] few years ago. The men that was digging
[1:53:01] down into the temple of Solomon, they
[1:53:03] found a piece of pottery down there that
[1:53:04] they didn't know what was had a language
[1:53:07] that they couldn't be identified. And
[1:53:09] they took it to a linguist. I met the
[1:53:11] man that was with them or his uh his
[1:53:14] church that was with them when they
[1:53:15] found the pottery in Israel. He flew in
[1:53:17] on a plane. They do a lot of excavations
[1:53:19] there. and and and I met him and he told
[1:53:21] me and showed me pictures of it and and
[1:53:23] told me he said we didn't even know what
[1:53:25] the writings meant and had no idea what
[1:53:27] it was and we finally got to a linguist
[1:53:29] that said you know what that is the
[1:53:31] ancient language of Sheba and here it
[1:53:34] was a measure it was a a piece of
[1:53:36] pottery that measured grain from the
[1:53:38] land of Sheba and it was the first thing
[1:53:40] that's ever been found in the land of
[1:53:42] Israel that came from Sheba he said I
[1:53:44] thought it wasn't it powerful that here
[1:53:46] 2,000 or or 5,000 years later that There
[1:53:50] is still evidence that that queen made
[1:53:52] it to the house of Solomon. I thought,
[1:53:54] my but even without it, I believe that
[1:53:56] she made it. Yes, sir.
[1:53:57] &gt;&gt; And I believe that there's people here
[1:53:58] this morning, there's evidence that you
[1:54:00] made it to the house of Solomon. There's
[1:54:02] evidence that you made it to the to the
[1:54:05] presence of the Holy Ghost.
[1:54:06] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:54:07] &gt;&gt; I believe if somebody excavated our
[1:54:09] life, they're going to found evidence.
[1:54:11] &gt;&gt; There's shards of our life that's
[1:54:12] evidence that we made it. I wonder how
[1:54:14] many could lift your hands. Say,
[1:54:15] "Brother man, I want my life to be
[1:54:17] evident that God that I was in the
[1:54:19] presence of God. Let me leave something
[1:54:21] in his presence and let let him leave
[1:54:23] something in my let me lay down
[1:54:24] something in his presence."
[1:54:26] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:54:27] &gt;&gt; That years and down the road, it'll be
[1:54:29] found. I wasn't carrying it. I laid it
[1:54:31] down in the presence of Solomon. I left
[1:54:32] him there. I gave it to him.
[1:54:34] &gt;&gt; And I came home carrying a new God.
[1:54:37] &gt;&gt; A real living God,
[1:54:39] &gt;&gt; an experience.
[1:54:40] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:54:42] &gt;&gt; Amen. Abraham said, "We don't lay
[1:54:44] prostrate before our before an idol, but
[1:54:46] we lay prostrate before the Holy Spirit
[1:54:49] waiting for the spirit of God that is on
[1:54:51] God to come into our heart, into our
[1:54:53] life. It'll change our whole life."
