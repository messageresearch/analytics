[13:47] resting place? And this world is not my
[13:50] home. I'm just a passing through. My
[13:54] treasures are laid up somewhere beyond
[13:58] the blue. The angels beckoning me from
[14:02] heaven's open doors. And I can't feel at
[14:05] home in this world anymore.

[14:19] beckoning me from heaven's open door and
[14:23] I can't feel at home in this world
[14:27] anymore.
[14:28] They're all expecting me. And that's one
[14:32] thing I know for I fixed it up with
[14:35] Jesus oh many years ago. And I know
[14:38] he'll see me through. Though I am weak
[14:42] at home and I can't feel at home in this
[14:46] world anymore.
[14:48] And oh Lord, you know I have no friend
[14:51] like you. If heaven's not my home, then

[15:10] eternally.

[15:15] victory. The songs of sweetest praise
[15:19] drip back from heaven shore. And I can't
[15:22] feel at home in this world anymore.
[15:26] And no Lord, you know
[15:29] no friend like you. My treasures are lit
[15:33] up somewhere beyond the blue. The angels
[15:37] beckoning me from heaven's open doors
[15:41] and I can't feel at home. Oh, let's all

[16:06] Amen. Brother, we pray the offer.
[16:09] [Music]
[16:30] Well, I'm laying up my treasures in that
[16:33] home above. Oh, I'm trusting, fully
[16:36] trusting in the Savior's love. I'm doing
[16:40] what I can for that heavenly love. Cuz
[16:44] I'm getting ready to leave this world.
[16:49] Well, I'm getting ready to leave this
[16:53] world. Oh, I'm getting ready for those
[16:56] gates of world. I'm keeping my record
[17:00] right, watching both day and night. I'm
[17:04] getting ready to leave this world. Oh,
[17:08] trusting in the riches of his saving
[17:12] grace. Oh, in each earthly trial I his
[17:15] love can trace. I'm sure that up in
[17:19] heaven I shall find a place. Cuz I'm
[17:23] getting ready to leave this world. And
[17:27] I'm getting ready to leave this world.
[17:32] And I'm getting ready for those gates of
[17:36] pearl. I'm keeping my record. I'm
[17:39] watching both day and night. I'm getting
[17:43] ready to leave this world. Oh, to
[17:47] prepare a mansion. Jesus said, "I'll
[17:50] go." And if it were not true, I would
[17:53] have told you so. Oh, just a little
[17:57] while to linger here below. But I'm
[18:01] getting ready to leave this world. Oh,
[18:05] I'm getting ready to leave this world.
[18:10] Oh, I'm getting ready for those gates of
[18:14] pearl. I'm keeping my record right,
[18:17] watching both day and night. I'm getting
[18:21] ready to leave this world. Oh, to
[18:25] prepare a mansion. Jesus said I'll go.
[18:29] And if it were not true, I would have
[18:31] told you so. Oh, just a little while to
[18:35] linger here below.
[18:38] But I'm getting ready. Oh, why don't you
[18:41] turn around, shake your neighbor's hand,
[18:43] tell them I'm getting ready to leave
[18:46] this world. Oh, I'm getting ready for
[18:50] those days of
[18:55] Oh, watching both day and night. I'm
[18:58] getting ready. I'll sing that last verse
[19:01] once more. Oh, to prepare a mansion.
[19:04] Jesus said, "I'll go." Cuz if it were
[19:08] not true, I would have told you so. Oh,
[19:12] just a little while to linger here
[19:15] below.
[19:16] But I'm getting ready. Sister De, you'll
[19:19] bring your song this morning. Oh, and
[19:21] I'm getting ready to leave this world.
[19:26] And I'm getting ready for those gates of
[19:30] pearl. I'm keeping my record right.
[19:33] Watching both day and night. I'm getting
[19:37] ready to leave this world. Oh, give the
[19:40] Lord hand clap a praise this morning.
[19:43] for the Joe if you'll be ready right
[19:44] after her and then Sister Van if you'll
[19:46] follow with the Joe.
[19:50] [Music]
[20:00] &gt;&gt; So, I've been thinking about this song
[20:02] for since Brother Joe um preached that
[20:05] message, Bride's Arsenal. I was always
[20:08] taught that and believe that raising my
[20:10] hands in worship is an act of surrender
[20:12] to God.
[20:15] Being vulnerable before him while
[20:16] receiving what he has in store for me,
[20:18] praising him with my whole heart, even
[20:20] when you don't feel like praising him.
[20:23] &gt;&gt; So, this is a song my mom used to sing.
[20:34] [Music]
[20:37] When your body is racked with pain
[20:43] and the pills you take in vain
[20:49] and the doctor says no more than I can
[20:55] do.
[20:58] There is something you will find
[21:03] and it works every time.
[21:08] Raise your hands and lift your hands and
[21:13] praise the Lord.
[21:17] Just raise your hands and lift your head
[21:22] and praise the Lord.
[21:28] Every need he will meet
[21:33] and much more.
[21:36] If you want your heart glad
[21:41] and to make the devil mad, just raise
[21:46] your hands, lift your head and praise
[21:51] the Lord.
[21:52] [Music]
[21:54] Just raise your hands and lift your head
[21:59] and praise the Lord.
[22:01] [Music]
[22:04] Every need he will make and much more.
[22:13] If you want your heart glad and to make
[22:19] the devil mad, just raise your hands and
[22:23] lift your head and praise the Lord.
[22:30] If you haven't got it done and your
[22:35] clothes begin to shine and your shoes,
[22:40] they are getting mighty thin.
[22:47] Just thank God for the mansion he's
[22:52] prepared
[22:53] just for you. Just raise your hands and
[22:58] lift your head and praise the Lord.
[23:02] Hallelujah.
[23:03] Just raise your hands and lift your
[23:07] hands and praise the Lord.
[23:11] [Music]
[23:12] Every need he will be and much more.
[23:21] If you want your heart glad and to make
[23:27] the devil mad, just raise your hands.
[23:31] Lift your head and praise the Lord.
[23:37] Just raise your hands. Lift your hands
[23:42] and praise the Lord.
[23:46] In every need he will be. and much more.
[23:54] If you want your heart glad and to make
[24:00] the devil mad, just raise your hands and
[24:05] lift your head and praise the Lord.
[24:10] Amen.
[24:12] [Applause]
[24:23] [Music]
[24:34] How many likes to make the devil mad?
[24:37] &gt;&gt; Won't you give a hand clap of praise to
[24:38] the Lord this morning?
[24:41] Certainly good. Ain't we thankful for
[24:42] his mercy and grace this morning? Where
[24:45] would we be without his mercy? This
[24:47] morning, Paul tells us in visions, we
[24:50] all came the same old way. Became this
[24:53] world and
[24:56] such darkness and gloom and doom. Looked
[24:58] like there was no way of escape,
[25:01] but there was conjunction. He said, "But
[25:03] God rich in mercy." Aren't you thankful
[25:07] for his mercy this morning? Hallelujah.
[25:09] You know this song. You help us sing it
[25:11] this morning.
[25:23] [Music]
[25:28] Clean with your mother
[25:31] were the words of Hosea
[25:35] as he sent his children to extend his
[25:40] mercy.
[25:43] So they journey down the old path
[25:48] led to much destruction.
[25:51] All the while their loving
[25:55] were hurting.
[25:57] [Music]
[25:59] Their hope was crushed inside
[26:03] as their compassion was denied.
[26:07] The woman they so love seemed like a
[26:11] stranger.
[26:14] Heartbroken and alone,
[26:18] they took the long road back home.
[26:22] For sin now reign and hopes and gone to
[26:26] change.
[26:29] [Music]
[26:33] One day the word was told. There were
[26:37] some slaves being sold.
[26:40] A restless love sa
[26:44] seeking.
[26:47] One by one they brought them in.
[26:51] So beaten down with sin.
[26:55] blood in his chest. His anxious heart
[26:59] was beating.
[27:00] [Music]
[27:02] All at once, she caught his eyes. From
[27:06] the lips, the bids were high.
[27:10] She could not believe the voice that she
[27:13] was hearing.
[27:17] Would in judgment take her life
[27:21] in this pain and shrine?
[27:24] What would happen as she saw her? Join
[27:28] near
[27:32] her.
[27:33] Oh, I've come to take you home.
[27:41] I know that you've done wrong.
[27:44] [Music]
[27:48] But for you, I gave my life. Through the
[27:52] sorrow, pain, and dry. Well, I could
[27:55] never let you go.
[28:02] So, let's leave the past behind.
[28:06] [Music]
[28:09] Love conquers one more time.
[28:16] He took her by the hand. Says there's a
[28:20] new day just ahead.
[28:24] I've come to take you home.
[28:27] This is where we're at now. Our past
[28:33] stood in that same place. Bound by sin,
[28:37] a broken slave.
[28:39] From the depths of my despair, I pray
[28:43] for mercy.
[28:46] Heard his word. He paid the price. On
[28:50] the cross, he gave his life. For he took
[28:54] my hand, said, "Child, you're in the
[28:58] family."
[29:02] Oh, I come to take you home.
[29:08] How many felt that feeling? I know that
[29:11] you done wrong.
[29:16] [Music]
[29:17] But for you, I gave my life through the
[29:21] sorrow, pain, and strive. Well, I can
[29:25] never let you go.
[29:31] So, let's leave that old past behind.
[29:36] Oh, that's his amazing grace this
[29:38] morning. Conquers one more time.
[29:45] Well, he took me by the hand. Says a new
[29:50] day's just ahead. Sing that last verse
[29:52] one more time. Oh, mercy's real to us
[29:55] this morning, saints.
[29:58] How many stood there?
[30:01] Well, I stood in that same place. Bound
[30:05] by sin, a broken slave. From the depths
[30:09] of my despair, I prayed for mercy.
[30:15] I heard his word. He paid the price. On
[30:19] a cross, he gave his life. Boy, he took
[30:23] my head, said, "Ch, you're in the
[30:26] family.
[30:31] Oh, I've come to take you home.
[30:35] [Music]
[30:39] Know that you've done wrong.
[30:45] You I gave my life through the sorrow,
[30:50] pain, and stri. Oh, I can never let you
[30:54] go.
[30:56] It's impossible, saints.
[30:59] So let's leave the past behind.
[31:03] [Music]
[31:06] God's love conquers one more time.
[31:13] Oh, he took us by the hand.
[31:16] Says a new day's just
[31:21] come to take you home.
[31:30] [Applause]
[31:42] [Music]
[32:01] [Music]
[32:06] Are you from the battle?
[32:13] Does it seem like the storm just won't
[32:17] break?
[32:19] Is there a mountain in front of you? The
[32:23] doubt says we'll never move. And you
[32:26] wonder, will God make a way?
[32:31] [Music]
[32:34] Will tell me a time
[32:37] he's not been faithful.
[32:41] Tell me a morning his mercies weren't
[32:45] new.
[32:47] Tell me a moment
[32:50] he wasn't able to carry you through.
[32:57] [Music]
[32:59] Tell me a day he was less than almighty
[33:06] when he could not roll back the high.
[33:11] child. When you look back, you're going
[33:15] to find there was never a time.
[33:20] [Music]
[33:24] So be strong in the Lord and remember
[33:31] to take hold of faith and stand firm.
[33:36] Oh, you can be confident. The Lord keeps
[33:41] his promises. If you doubt him, just
[33:45] read through his word
[33:48] and tell me it's
[33:52] not been faithful.
[33:54] Tell me a morning his mercies weren't
[33:59] new.
[34:00] Tell me a moment.
[34:03] He was unable to carry you through.
[34:11] [Music]
[34:12] Tell me a day he was less than almighty
[34:19] when he could not roll back the t.
[34:24] child. When you look back, you're going
[34:28] to find there was never a time.
[34:36] He can work miracles, do the impossible.
[34:42] If you don't believe it, just go on and
[34:47] try
[34:51] to tell me a time
[34:54] he's not been faithful. Tell me a
[34:59] morning his mercies were new.
[35:03] Tell me a moment
[35:06] he was unable to carry you through.
[35:15] Tell me a day he was less than almighty
[35:22] when he could not roll back the tie.
[35:27] Child, when you look back, you're going
[35:31] to find there was never a time.
[35:36] [Music]
[35:39] Child, when you look back, you're going
[35:43] to find there was never a time.
[35:48] [Music]
[35:51] [Applause]
[35:56] If there's ever been a time he's failed
[35:57] you,
[35:58] &gt;&gt; you may be like Daniel and pray for 21
[36:00] days and get no answers. That means he
[36:03] never heard. That just means it's on its
[36:05] way.
[36:05] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[36:06] &gt;&gt; You may think you're three days late
[36:07] like Lazarus, but that he's still right

[36:27] flee.

[36:42] his name. Oh, praise his name.
[36:47] He's in the house. First verse.
[36:52] Little girl was lying there. People all
[36:56] were weeping.
[36:58] They just laughed at Jesus when she said
[37:01] she's only sleeping.
[37:04] As he took her by the hand, she began to
[37:08] live again. Some began to praise the
[37:12] Lord. Some began to say,
[37:16] "He's in the house. Oh, death has to
[37:20] flee."
[37:22] Oh, now there is light where darkness
[37:26] used to be.
[37:28] Now there is hope.
[37:31] There's no more doubt.
[37:34] I will praise his name.
[37:37] Praise his name.
[37:40] He's in the house.
[37:45] [Music]
[37:47] We were like
[37:52] when he's in the house. Oh, death has to

[38:25] all our sin.
[38:28] Jesus touched his heart of mine and gave
[38:31] me life again.
[38:34] I am just a house to claim. Ever since
[38:38] that blessed day, there's a light that
[38:41] shines on me for all the world to see.
[38:46] He's in the house. Oh, death has to
[38:50] flee.

[39:05] name. Oh, praise his name. In the
[39:09] course, he's in the house. Oh, death has
[39:13] to flee.
[39:15] Oh, now there is light. When darkness,

[39:42] our sins. How many has that testimony
[39:45] this morning?
[39:47] &gt;&gt; And he gave me life again.
[39:51] I am just a house of clay. But ever
[39:54] since that blessed day, there's a light
[39:58] that shines in me for all the world to
[40:01] see.
[40:03] He's in the house

[40:09] And now there is light where darkness
[40:13] used to be. And now there is hope.
[40:19] There's no more doubt. So I praise his
[40:23] name.
[40:25] Praise his name.

[43:01] to make your bodies a living sacrifice
[43:03] unto the Lord. I I believe we have a
[43:05] right to praise God. Amen. Do you
[43:06] believe that? I believe we have a right
[43:08] to worship God. I can tell you what a
[43:10] prophet said. As long as it's off of a
[43:12] sanctified altar, God will accept it.
[43:14] And I I believe that we come this
[43:15] morning as a body of believers. We
[43:17] sanctified our lives to the Lord. And
[43:20] because you have done that, you have a
[43:21] right to worship God. And God hears our
[43:24] praise and he inhabits the praise of his
[43:26] people. I believe that. You believe that
[43:28] this morning? How many needs the Lord
[43:29] just to step down and inhabit your
[43:31] praise this morning? Amen. Will we make
[43:34] him welcome? Amen. You love the Lord
[43:36] this morning. Amen. We just want to say
[43:39] we sure it's good to be in the house of
[43:42] the Lord and I just count it a privilege

[43:46] God and we're so honored uh to be able
[43:49] to come and speak to you and uh thank
[43:52] God for each one of you and it sure sure
[43:55] wouldn't be a church without people in
[43:56] it. and but but we're here this morning

[45:17] remember them in in prayer this morning.
[45:20] And maybe if you have a need on your
[45:22] heart, just lift your hand to the Lord.
[45:23] I know God knows what we have need of uh
[45:26] this morning and we'll just ask him to
[45:28] come. Let's just bow our heads together.
[45:30] Gracious heavenly father, Lord, we just
[45:33] thank you, Lord, for an opportunity,
[45:35] Lord, to come and gather in this little
[45:38] sanctuary that you've given us, Lord,
[45:40] that we could fellowship around the word
[45:41] of God. And Lord, here I stand in a
[45:44] group of believers, Lord, of people of
[45:47] like precious faith. And Lord, we come.
[45:49] We have no agenda, Lord. No motive of
[45:52] any kind outside of this gospel, Lord.
[45:55] But we believe according to your word,
[45:57] Lord, that we have a cause, Lord, we
[45:59] have a real a cause to be able to stand.
[46:02] And Lord, to be able to to battle
[46:04] against the enemy, Lord, that would come
[46:06] and Lord, that would be such a hindrance
[46:08] to your children. But Lord, we have an
[46:10] authority over that enemy this morning.
[46:13] And Lord, we just ask you that you would
[46:14] come, Lord, in a special way. Lord, I
[46:17] pray that you would minister to every
[46:18] heart, Lord, knowing there's many great
[46:20] needs, Lord, this uh child, Lord, that
[46:22] has never uh done anything wrong, Lord,
[46:25] never had anything in its life. And
[46:28] Lord, we just ask, Lord, that you would
[46:29] intervene. Lord, I believe we have a
[46:31] right as a believers, Lord, to call upon
[46:33] your name. Lord, I pray that you would
[46:34] touch them. And Lord, that you would
[46:36] deliver this baby. Lord, we just ask
[46:38] you, Lord. I know that you're a healer.
[46:40] Lord, I pray for everyone in this
[46:42] building, Lord. And I pray that
[46:43] something would be said that would be a
[46:44] help to the church, Lord, that we could
[46:46] go from this place knowing that we've
[46:48] been in your presence and we'll give you
[46:50] the glory for everything that's been
[46:52] done and said. We thank you for it now
[46:54] in Jesus name. Amen. Amen. God bless you
[46:59] this morning. We just want to invite you
[47:01] to the scripture to the book of
[47:03] Zechariah and we're going to read out of
[47:05] the 14th chapter and the sixth uh verse,
[47:08] sixth and seventh uh verse. So, we'll
[47:11] just give you a moment just to turn
[47:13] there. And I I just want to say it's a
[47:16] certainly a real privilege uh to be able
[47:19] to preach the gospel to believers. Amen.
[47:22] And uh how many believers do we have
[47:24] here this morning? Amen. We just uh we
[47:27] just certainly uh count it an honor and
[47:30] uh what a responsibility it is. You
[47:33] know, I was thinking about how uh that
[47:35] that God would entrust us to be able to
[47:38] speak something to the bride of Christ,
[47:40] a people that means everything to him
[47:42] enough that he would give his own life
[47:44] for them. Uh so you got to be careful
[47:46] what you say uh to the bride of Jesus
[47:48] Christ. It's a great responsibility. And
[47:51] uh so we just want to uh trust the Lord
[47:53] this morning that something would be
[47:55] said uh that would be a help to you. uh
[47:57] Zechariah the 14th chapter uh the sixth
[48:00] verse the Bible says and it shall come
[48:02] to pass in that day that the light shall
[48:05] not be clear nor dark but it shall be
[48:08] one day which shall be known unto the
[48:10] Lord. Now notice it says one day it
[48:12] shall be known unto the Lord not day nor
[48:15] night but it shall come to pass that at
[48:17] the evening time it shall be light. And
[48:20] we'll just ask the Lord to add his
[48:22] blessing to the reading of the word this
[48:23] morning as you take your seats.
[48:25] Um over the last few Sundays um that I
[48:29] have the ones I had spoke I had been
[48:31] speaking in this uh same direction we
[48:34] had taken out of Ephesians the first
[48:36] chapter when it was the prayer of
[48:38] Apostle Paul uh Paul's prayer was that
[48:40] the eyes of our hearts would be
[48:42] enlightened. It was always uh uh the
[48:44] prayer of of the apostle Paul when he
[48:47] was spreading the gospel is that people
[48:48] would have a revelation of what it was
[48:51] that he was preaching. And so, uh, we've
[48:53] been preaching out of that. And last
[48:54] Sunday, we had taken this, uh, uh,
[48:57] direction on this scripture, uh, on the
[48:59] revealing of redemption. And so, I want
[49:02] to, I want to just continue in this. The
[49:05] Lord just keeps this on my heart. And,
[49:07] uh, but I would like to take this
[49:08] direction this morning on out of the
[49:10] shadows and into the light. Out of the
[49:13] shadows and into the light. Here we're
[49:15] reading in the scripture of Zechariah
[49:17] the 14th chapter. I know this is a very
[49:19] familiar scripture, but uh Zachchariah
[49:21] is speaking of a day that is to come.
[49:23] Now uh he speaks this he prophesied this
[49:26] over 500 years before that day ever
[49:29] came. It was uh uh quite some time had
[49:31] passed. But uh he was speaking of a day
[49:34] that would come. It would be a gloomy
[49:35] day. Last Sunday uh we were going
[49:37] through this scripture and talking about
[49:39] how that it was a day without without uh
[49:42] it wouldn't be dark. It wouldn't be
[49:43] light, but it would be a gloomy day. and
[49:45] and uh and that day was we realized from
[49:48] last time that brother Bram would
[49:50] actually show us that that one day was
[49:52] an age of time uh between the time of
[49:55] Jesus leaving the earth and the time of
[49:58] the rapture. So during during this age
[50:00] of time, so from it would be one long
[50:02] day from the time of Jesus to the time
[50:04] of a rapture and uh that the day would
[50:06] not be called day or night, but it would
[50:08] be a gloomy day. And uh but I want you
[50:10] to catch this that the glooiness of the
[50:13] day was that the lack of a full
[50:15] revelation. It wasn't that uh it wasn't
[50:17] that that there was uh that it was a a
[50:20] natural uh uh uh glooiness, but it was a
[50:23] spiritual glooiness. So the glooiness of
[50:25] this long day has been the lack of a
[50:28] fullness of a revelation. And so uh what
[50:30] Zachchariah is telling us but at the end
[50:32] of this day there's going to come a full
[50:34] revelation to the church and said so at
[50:37] the evening time there shall be light. I
[50:39] thought it that's just something to
[50:40] realize that the age that we're living
[50:42] in and you know you think about the
[50:43] history and from the time of Apostle
[50:45] Paul who was the the messenger to the
[50:47] gentile church and all through the ages
[50:50] there's been great revivals and great
[50:52] moves of God and great uh healings and
[50:54] great campaigns all around the world but
[50:56] still yet in all of the move of God
[50:59] there was still a glooiness. In other
[51:01] words, there was no fullness of
[51:02] revelation. And I thought, you know, if
[51:04] they could have a revival in a gloomy
[51:05] day, and they could have a a move of God
[51:08] in a gloomy day, and if there could be
[51:09] great movements in the church in the
[51:11] gloomy day when the fullness of the
[51:13] revelation wasn't there, then what about
[51:14] the age when there would be light? I if
[51:17] they could have a revival, then what
[51:19] what kind of revival ought we be having
[51:21] today? Uh we realize that what the angel
[51:23] of the Lord, he actually declared that
[51:25] the fullness of the revelation would
[51:27] come in the age that we're living in.
[51:29] How many believe that this morning? You
[51:30] know that means that there's a greater
[51:32] revelation that you have today uh than
[51:34] than there has been in any in any part
[51:36] of this day and any from the time of
[51:38] Jesus till now. It's been ministered
[51:41] about it. It's been brought about.
[51:42] They've been waiting to see it for 2,000
[51:45] years. But but because of the glooiness
[51:47] of the spirit or of revelation, brother
[51:50] Bobby, they uh they they haven't been
[51:51] able to see it. But the Bible said, "But
[51:53] in the evening time, the gloom would be
[51:55] lifted. There would be a great light
[51:57] that would shine." And I don't know
[51:58] about y'all, but I'm just happy to be
[52:00] living in the presence of that great
[52:02] light. I I don't believe I'm no great
[52:04] person. I don't believe I'm any better
[52:06] than anybody else. But I I thank God
[52:08] that I'm living in the revelation of the
[52:10] light of this age. And I believe that
[52:12] that that the light has shined upon the
[52:14] word of God. And now as a body of
[52:16] believers that we are seeing the
[52:18] vindication of the resurrection of Jesus
[52:21] Christ. How many how many sees that? You
[52:22] do you realize that that's what the
[52:24] world had been waiting on from the time
[52:26] of his crucifixion and he came to the
[52:28] disciples and he appeared and he
[52:30] ascended into glory from that very time
[52:33] for 2,000 years. The world has been
[52:35] waiting on a vindication or a proof of
[52:37] the resurrection of Jesus Christ. That's
[52:39] the great debate surrounding all
[52:41] Christianity as a proof of his
[52:43] resurrection. And that's what the that
[52:45] has happened in this age by the fullness
[52:48] of revelation that the light has came to
[52:50] this age. Brother Bobby, it was a
[52:52] vindication of the resurrection. That's
[52:54] what that's what this revelation
[52:56] brought. And and that's why we can look
[52:58] at this age and we realize that there's
[52:59] been miracles performed in this day that
[53:02] has that that haven't been since the
[53:04] days of Jesus. There's been there's
[53:05] there's been things that took place in
[53:07] this day that that was like they were in
[53:09] the days of Jesus. There was a
[53:10] discernment that took place in this day
[53:12] just like it was in the days of Jesus.
[53:14] He what it was is a vindication of the
[53:17] resurrection of Jesus Christ. So I can
[53:20] say this to sum it up this morning that
[53:22] the revelation of this message has
[53:24] become the light to this age. How many
[53:26] believes that the revelation of this
[53:28] message is the very light to this.
[53:30] There's no light outside of that. It is
[53:31] the very light of the age. I'm just
[53:33] making a a foundation this morning so
[53:36] you know where I stand. But I believe
[53:37] that the revelation of this message is
[53:39] what gives light to the very age that
[53:41] we're living in. And I believe that
[53:43] we're living at the end of the age. How
[53:45] many believe that we're we're living at
[53:46] the end of the age? We're living in the
[53:48] end time. all of the Bible uh prophesies
[53:50] of this age that we're living in. Uh but
[53:53] I thank God that although that we're
[53:54] living in the end time that brother
[53:56] Bobby, but we're not living in darkness.
[53:58] We're we're living in the in the end of
[54:00] the age, but we're not wondering what
[54:02] tomorrow holds and what and what's going
[54:04] to happen to the world and what's going
[54:06] to happen to the earth and the the
[54:07] believers don't have to live like that.
[54:09] We because we're living in the light of
[54:11] the age. So therefore, we know what
[54:13] tomorrow holds. We know what's going to
[54:15] happen and uh we know uh what will
[54:17] happen with the end of the world and we
[54:18] know where we're going to be and we know
[54:20] to whom we came from and to whom we
[54:22] belong and to who holds our tomorrow. So
[54:25] therefore, we're not living in the
[54:26] glooiness of any day, but we're living
[54:28] in the fullness of the revelation of God
[54:30] in in this age.
[54:32] &gt;&gt; So we're living under the light of the
[54:34] evening time. I I think that's powerful.
[54:36] In other words, we're living in the
[54:37] fulfillment of a 2500 year old prophecy.
[54:40] Isn't that wonderful, brother David?
[54:42] You're living in the fulfillment of a
[54:44] prophecy that was wrote 2500 years ago.
[54:46] There ain't no telling how many people
[54:48] read through that. And I wonder what who
[54:50] did that apply to and when's this going
[54:52] to take place? But now we are living in
[54:54] the fulfillment of that very thing.
[54:56] Millions of people have read those very
[54:58] words, but you're not reading it. You're
[55:00] living in it.
[55:01] &gt;&gt; I thank God to be a part of that group
[55:03] of people this morning. You know, we
[55:05] were talking about Adam uh last Sunday
[55:07] of how that God had walked into the
[55:09] garden. And he said when he came in the
[55:11] garden, Adam had first sinned, but God
[55:13] made a way of redemption for him right
[55:15] quick. As soon as he sinned, he made a
[55:17] way of redemption. And I thought, isn't
[55:18] it something that in the day of sin, the
[55:21] way of redemption was made? So, here
[55:22] we're living through this great day, but
[55:24] even in this day that God has provided a
[55:27] way of redemption. And I I wanted just
[55:28] to read this because he said when he he
[55:30] broke his fellowship that he that God
[55:32] slayed an innocent lamb and he made a
[55:34] carpet for Adam to walk back to God on.
[55:36] And he said it was a carpet of
[55:38] redemption. I thought, isn't that the
[55:39] way it is now? That you realize that God
[55:42] has rolled out that carpet for the
[55:44] church at the end of this age. You say,
[55:45] "Well, brother Matt, where is that
[55:47] carpet?" It is the message of the hour.
[55:49] If you want to find the redemption of
[55:51] Jesus Christ that that he paid for, it
[55:54] come through the message of the hour.
[55:55] That that's what God has sent us. I
[55:57] believe he's given us a pathway. He's
[55:59] paved the way to redemption. He paved
[56:01] the way to grace. He paved the way to a
[56:03] true revival. He He paved the way for
[56:06] men to come back into fellowship with
[56:07] God to be able to see the the very
[56:10] vindication of the resurrection of Jesus
[56:12] Christ. He he says, "See, through all of
[56:14] these ages, when Adam and Eve was
[56:16] walking out of the garden, he said the
[56:18] shadows of redemption were before them."
[56:20] In other words, they saw the shadow of
[56:23] something that they couldn't even live
[56:24] in. He said it the in the Mosaic laws in
[56:27] the ceremonies and sacrifices was also a
[56:29] foreshadow of the coming of a perfect
[56:32] sacrifice. It was the perfect plan of
[56:34] God's redemption. So all through the Old
[56:36] Testament here we read about it's a
[56:38] foreshadow of what God is going to do in
[56:41] this age. All the uh every time a father
[56:43] would take a sacrifice and go sacrifice
[56:46] it for his children. It was a foreshadow
[56:48] of this age that we're living in. every
[56:50] e every every every part of the law. He
[56:52] said it was a shadow of redemption that
[56:55] was before them. He said all these laws
[56:56] they foreshadowed the coming of a
[56:58] perfect sacrifice. He said but when they
[57:00] foresaw those things through the through
[57:02] the the the bleeding sacrifice of the
[57:04] animals that they were slaying as a
[57:06] goeteen or a covering he said and in
[57:09] that shadow we're talking about Adam
[57:11] coming out of the garden. He said but in
[57:13] that shadow they foresaw the coming of
[57:16] the Lord Jesus.
[57:18] My isn't that something this morning
[57:19] that brother Mark even in that time that
[57:21] they would see they foreshadowed they
[57:23] saw something that was to come but but
[57:25] but they were looking at one thing but
[57:27] they saw another. They saw they were
[57:29] looking at a lamb that had been slain
[57:30] but they saw something that was to come.
[57:32] They were they were looking at bulls and
[57:34] goats but they saw Jesus Christ in the
[57:36] shadow. I I thought isn't it something
[57:38] that all through this time they had to
[57:40] see that in a shadow? But when it comes
[57:42] to you and I if there ever was an age
[57:44] that Christ was visible it's in this
[57:46] age. No longer are we looking at a
[57:48] shadow. We're not looking at the
[57:50] foreshadow of something to come. No,
[57:52] we're not looking at something to come
[57:53] in the future, but we're living in the
[57:55] present tense light of the word of God.
[57:58] Brother Mark, therefore, it's not a
[58:00] shadow any longer to the believers. I
[58:02] can I can just say that like this this
[58:03] morning. There's never been more truth
[58:06] or more revelation in the Bible in the
[58:08] last 2,000 years than there is right
[58:10] now. We're living under the greatest
[58:12] light. How many believe that? We're
[58:14] we're living under the greatest light
[58:15] that there has ever been. We're living
[58:17] under the greatest revelation that that
[58:19] there has ever been. There's never been
[58:21] more light. There's never been more
[58:22] revelation there. There's never been a
[58:24] people that that that has seen as much
[58:26] as the people that are living in this
[58:28] age. That's the age that we're living
[58:30] in. And because of that, we're not
[58:32] looking at the law. We're not looking at
[58:34] an animal sacrifice. We're not looking
[58:36] at denominations. We're not looking at
[58:39] man-made or manf following religions.
[58:41] But we're looking at one thing and his
[58:43] name is Jesus Christ. We have been given
[58:46] a light in this age to look to one and
[58:48] his name is Christ Jesus.
[58:50] &gt;&gt; See, many have built up many things to
[58:52] look to and but you realize that that
[58:54] that we've been given one thing. That
[58:56] light was to shine. It was the the the
[58:58] revelation of this message was to shed
[59:00] light upon Jesus Christ. Isn't that
[59:03] wonderful? It's funny how it ain't
[59:04] funny, but it's odd how people get that
[59:06] all wrong and and they think that it's
[59:08] bringing light on something else, but
[59:09] the reality is the revelation of the
[59:11] message was to shine a light upon Jesus
[59:14] Christ. It it was to bring a revelation
[59:16] of him and and who he is. And he's not a
[59:18] a god of history. He's not a a god of
[59:21] yesterday, but still yet today. He's
[59:23] still the same Jesus. It was to shine
[59:25] light upon Jesus Christ. But see,
[59:28] sometimes in order to see him that we
[59:31] have to be willing to change our
[59:32] perspective to see Christ. See, many
[59:34] look at what you look at, they don't see
[59:36] Christ like you see him. You ever
[59:38] noticed that? You could take a scripture
[59:40] or something to share with somebody and
[59:42] and they they just don't see what you
[59:43] see in it. But you have to be willing to
[59:45] change your perspective. I I remember
[59:47] the a story of a man that came to
[59:50] brother Bosworth's meeting. How many
[59:51] remember brother Bosworth or a member of
[59:53] him? Brother Bosworth was a great man.
[59:55] He was a uh one of brother Brandham's
[59:57] dear friends. He was a colleague and uh
[59:59] even uh when they had the great debate
[1:00:01] in the Houston Coliseum, it was brother
[1:00:03] Bosworth that that came there. Remember
[1:00:05] he was he would stand on his behalf and
[1:00:07] he was a he was a great ministry. I've
[1:00:09] always felt a connection with brother
[1:00:11] Bossworth because I was born on his
[1:00:13] birthday and he also was a trumpet
[1:00:14] player. So I you know I always always
[1:00:17] liked him and and he wrote the book
[1:00:19] Christ the Healer. had a great has a
[1:00:20] great ministry and and uh in in his in
[1:00:24] uh in brother Bosworth's life he was
[1:00:26] actually a Methodist minister and and uh
[1:00:28] in Isuza Street he came into Pentecost
[1:00:30] in Isuza Street. He was one of the
[1:00:32] founders of the Assembly of God church
[1:00:34] and just for a few years he he actually
[1:00:37] was a leader in that until they started
[1:00:39] preaching that uh the initial evidence
[1:00:41] of the Holy Ghost and he separated from
[1:00:42] the Assembly of God movement. But but
[1:00:44] brother Bosworth was he was so close
[1:00:46] with with brother Brandon whenever he
[1:00:48] was dying. He was the one that brother
[1:00:49] Brandham went all the way down uh
[1:00:50] remember he said he drove the wheels off
[1:00:52] his car that night cuz he he heard he
[1:00:54] was passing away to go be with him. And
[1:00:56] whenever he got there he asked him he
[1:00:57] said brother Bosworth he said can I pray
[1:00:59] for you? And he said no I'm not sick. He
[1:01:02] said well what's the matter with you? He
[1:01:04] said I'm about to go home. He said here
[1:01:05] he was laying on his deathbed. He said I
[1:01:07] I went to pray for him. He said no. He
[1:01:09] goes I'm on my way home. But but he
[1:01:11] actually asked him, he said, "Brother
[1:01:12] Bosworth, if you can tell me what was
[1:01:14] the greatest or the the crowning moment
[1:01:16] in your ministry of all the mission
[1:01:18] fields that you've been on," he was
[1:01:19] there with brother Brandham in India and
[1:01:22] different in Africa and all these
[1:01:24] different places throughout the
[1:01:25] meetings. And he said, "In all of the
[1:01:26] great meetings and the great revival,
[1:01:28] Brother Bosworth had one meeting in
[1:01:30] 1924. There were 12,000 people came to
[1:01:33] the altar in one meeting up in Canada.
[1:01:34] He had a great ministry." He said, "And
[1:01:36] in all of those great meetings and
[1:01:38] things that you've been in," he said,
[1:01:39] "what was the what's the crowning moment
[1:01:42] of your ministry or of your life?" And
[1:01:44] and I love his reply. He said, "The
[1:01:46] crowning moment of my life is right
[1:01:47] now." He said, "Because I'm going home
[1:01:49] to be with my Lord." He said, "I I've
[1:01:51] spent all of my life preaching about
[1:01:53] Jesus Christ and trying to show people
[1:01:56] and introduced him to Jesus Christ." He
[1:01:58] said, "And I know just in a few moments
[1:02:00] that same one I've been talking about is
[1:02:02] going to walk into this room and he's
[1:02:04] going to take me on home. See, see, in
[1:02:06] in in Brother Bosworth, it was it was in
[1:02:09] Brother Bosworth's meetings that this
[1:02:10] man came to and and I don't know if you
[1:02:12] ever remember the testimony, but uh you
[1:02:15] may not have knew his name, but you've
[1:02:16] heard the testimony, but uh the man's uh
[1:02:18] name was John Spru or Spruel. And and
[1:02:21] John Spruel was a World War I veteran.
[1:02:23] He fought in the 32nd Division in World
[1:02:25] War I. He was uh went through many uh
[1:02:28] great uh uh uh uh uh troubles in in in
[1:02:31] the battle. and and and whenever you
[1:02:33] hear his testimony, he wasn't a he
[1:02:35] wasn't a Medal of Honor recipient. He
[1:02:37] wasn't a a great military man. They
[1:02:39] didn't write a bunch of books about uh
[1:02:41] uh John Spruel, but but his story comes
[1:02:44] from his injury that took place on the
[1:02:46] battlefield. And and John Spruel became
[1:02:48] a great evangelist in in the in the
[1:02:50] United States. And and uh but on the
[1:02:52] battlefield, he had they had been
[1:02:54] gassed. He and one of his friends and
[1:02:56] and the gas had left him without speech
[1:02:58] and had had they had laid unconscious.
[1:03:00] and uh it had destroyed a lot of his uh
[1:03:03] being able to breathe and speech and his
[1:03:04] lungs and his throat and and uh and so
[1:03:07] they took him to the hospital. He wound
[1:03:08] up going through I believe it was like
[1:03:10] 14 or so uh uh uh different operations
[1:03:13] that he went through uh uh to be healed,
[1:03:15] but he was left with no voice. And
[1:03:17] there's actually an article I found an
[1:03:19] old article brother Kyle has back there
[1:03:21] that that talks about uh John Spir's
[1:03:23] healing. And uh but it was in brother
[1:03:25] Bosworth's meeting that John Sproul
[1:03:27] comes to and and uh and he comes and he
[1:03:30] tells his testimony about being in the
[1:03:32] meeting. And he said when he went into
[1:03:34] the meeting he had went through all
[1:03:35] these operations but the operations left
[1:03:37] him without any voice. It left him
[1:03:38] without uh the ability to speak. He
[1:03:40] could barely breathe let alone uh to be
[1:03:42] able to speak. But uh he went through he
[1:03:44] said I followed after the medicine. I
[1:03:46] followed after the doctor and I believe
[1:03:47] in doctors. I done everything they said.
[1:03:49] He said but I also believe that God
[1:03:51] answers prayer. and uh and he went into
[1:03:53] brother Bosworth's meeting. He tells
[1:03:55] this testimony at this meeting that he
[1:03:57] went into brother Bosworth's service and
[1:03:59] and and the Lord had came and he healed
[1:04:01] him in the service. He said, "And his
[1:04:02] recovery was immediate." Said, "When I
[1:04:04] left out of there, my speech came back
[1:04:06] with just a few days. I was able to talk
[1:04:09] a few days. There was no sign of it."
[1:04:11] And and he became an evangelist off of
[1:04:13] his testimony
[1:04:15] of God being able to heal his body. They
[1:04:17] actually uh they actually spoke of him
[1:04:19] as the as that that that military
[1:04:21] evangelist or the veteran evangelist. Uh
[1:04:24] but but he had quite a testimony uh of
[1:04:26] when he was healed and but it was John
[1:04:28] Spruel. Thank you, brother Kyle. It was
[1:04:30] John Spruel uh that brother Bham tells
[1:04:32] the story about and uh that that talks
[1:04:34] about how that he was in that he he was
[1:04:36] in France to go back and visit the grave
[1:04:39] of his friend that had lo that had died
[1:04:41] in that same battle. And so he had gone
[1:04:43] he went to visit the grave of his
[1:04:45] friend. And in this place, he came to
[1:04:47] the garden or the statue. I know it took
[1:04:49] me a long way, but I I love the the
[1:04:51] history of it, but but he came to the
[1:04:53] garden of the statue of Jesus Christ. He
[1:04:55] was hanging on the cross. And they told
[1:04:57] him, they said, "It depicts the it
[1:04:59] depicts Christ." and and and they there
[1:05:01] was so many people that told him about
[1:05:02] this place and and so John Spurl was the
[1:05:05] man that went to that place and he was
[1:05:07] looking at the the cross and Jesus
[1:05:08] hanging on the cross and and he told the
[1:05:11] the curator of the of the place he said
[1:05:13] you know he said this is supposed to be
[1:05:15] uh something that would display Christ
[1:05:17] and all these people's been talking
[1:05:18] about it and it's supposed to show his
[1:05:20] suffering and show his agony and and all
[1:05:22] this he said but it just looks like a
[1:05:23] statue to me he said I was being very
[1:05:25] critical about it he said but whenever
[1:05:27] the man came by he said well sir the
[1:05:29] reason you don't see in it what all
[1:05:31] those other people saw in it is because
[1:05:33] you're not looking at it like they were
[1:05:35] looking at it. He said, "Well, how can I
[1:05:36] look at it differently?" He said, "Well,
[1:05:38] the way this was designed," he said,
[1:05:40] "you see, there's an altar over here at
[1:05:41] the foot of that cross." He said, "And
[1:05:43] it's made for a man to kneel down at
[1:05:46] that altar and then look up at the cross
[1:05:48] of Calvary." He said, "And so I went and
[1:05:50] I knelt down at the altar." He said,
[1:05:52] "And when I knelt down at the altar, my
[1:05:54] whole perspective changed." She said,
[1:05:56] "So, because when I looked at it from
[1:05:57] that point of view," he said, "I saw the
[1:06:00] agony and I saw the nail uh uh scars in
[1:06:03] his hands and I saw the place in his
[1:06:05] side where they the Roman soldiers had
[1:06:07] pierced his side." But said, "See, it
[1:06:09] matters the way you look at it." See, he
[1:06:12] see if you look at the word today like
[1:06:14] it was a Jesus back there that a Christ
[1:06:17] that lived thousand years ago. He's not
[1:06:19] today. He's not the or he's not the same
[1:06:21] today or not the same yesterday, today,
[1:06:23] and forever. If you look at it like
[1:06:25] that, that's all you will ever see in
[1:06:27] it. He said, "But it's not to be looked
[1:06:29] at as a god of history. This Bible isn't
[1:06:32] to be looked at as a book of history."
[1:06:34] He said, "But it's made that you would
[1:06:36] get down and look up at it and believe
[1:06:39] it." I believe that this morning. I
[1:06:40] believe that when you want to look to
[1:06:42] find Christ, it's not to be looked at
[1:06:44] from a from a high place. But Brother
[1:06:46] Bam said, "If you really want to see
[1:06:47] Christ, you think if you want to look at
[1:06:49] him, then brother Mar, you have to get
[1:06:51] down and look up and believe it. you you
[1:06:54] can't see him from a high place. You
[1:06:56] can't see him from a theological
[1:06:57] standpoint. You can't see him from an
[1:06:59] educational standpoint. He said, "But if
[1:07:01] you really want to see Christ, you have
[1:07:03] to get down and look up and believe. You
[1:07:06] ain't You ain't going to be able to
[1:07:07] teach it into somebody. You're not going
[1:07:09] to be able to train it into somebody.
[1:07:11] You're not going to be able to make them
[1:07:12] see Jesus Christ. But if you really want
[1:07:14] to see Christ, you have to get down,
[1:07:16] look up, and believe it."
[1:07:19] &gt;&gt; He said, "That's the way we have to do.
[1:07:20] He said, "The days of miracles, we can
[1:07:22] always believe the days of miracles are
[1:07:23] passed. I don't know if that's really
[1:07:25] right or not." Here, we're supposed to
[1:07:26] be living in these days. I don't know if
[1:07:28] that's really right or not. He said,
[1:07:29] "But God didn't write his word for that
[1:07:32] reason. He wrote his word that you would
[1:07:34] get down on your knees and you would
[1:07:36] look up through the promise of God,
[1:07:38] through the blood of the Lord Jesus." He
[1:07:41] said, "And it'll look different to you
[1:07:43] whenever you look at it in that way."
[1:07:46] All of a sudden it takes on a different
[1:07:48] image when you come in the right
[1:07:50] perspective and you look at it. He says
[1:07:52] see it isn't to be criticized and say
[1:07:54] these things won't be said but this
[1:07:56] Bible that said that Jesus Christ is the
[1:07:58] same yesterday and today and forever.
[1:08:00] And brother Bram said when he was the
[1:08:02] same yesterday today and forever he was
[1:08:04] the same in principle and he was the
[1:08:06] same in power. So this is the same Jesus
[1:08:08] that he was. So whatever he was then in
[1:08:10] principle that's what he is today. and
[1:08:12] whatever he was then in power see most
[1:08:15] want to take the power and say well he's
[1:08:16] the same God of power and he's the same
[1:08:18] healer he's the same supernatural Jesus
[1:08:20] that he was he said but he was also the
[1:08:22] same in principle so the very thing that
[1:08:24] he stood for then he stands for today
[1:08:27] he's the same Jesus
[1:08:29] &gt;&gt; as he was back then in principle and
[1:08:31] power he said but on your knees and when
[1:08:33] you look up that way then it'll look
[1:08:35] different to you then
[1:08:36] &gt;&gt; I think that's a good lesson this
[1:08:38] morning
[1:08:39] &gt;&gt; that when we come to the right way to
[1:08:41] look at Christ that we'll see him. I I
[1:08:43] believe that's the way it ought to be
[1:08:44] with the whole Bible. Brother Mark,
[1:08:45] whenever we come to church, we ought to
[1:08:47] look to see Christ. How many believe
[1:08:48] that? I believe when we come to the
[1:08:50] house of God, we ought to look to see
[1:08:52] Christ. When we when we come to the
[1:08:53] house of God, we ought to look to see
[1:08:55] the hand of God. When we when we come in
[1:08:57] the house of God, we ought to look to
[1:08:58] hear the voice of God. We ought to
[1:09:00] approach God in that way, to prepare to
[1:09:03] see a living God. We're not preparing to
[1:09:06] learn some history. We want to prepare
[1:09:08] our hearts to see a living God. When you
[1:09:10] look at the word of God, we prepare to
[1:09:12] see a living God. When you when you read
[1:09:14] the Bible, I want to see Jesus Christ.
[1:09:17] But Abraham said Jesus Christ is the
[1:09:19] principal theme of the entire Bible. And
[1:09:22] if you read the Bible and you don't see
[1:09:23] Christ in every verse of it, then you go
[1:09:26] back and read it again because you miss
[1:09:27] something. For the Bible is Christ and
[1:09:30] he is the word. Isn't that powerful that
[1:09:33] everywhere you look, you can see God.
[1:09:35] Everywhere you look in the Bible, he
[1:09:36] said you'll see Jesus Christ. That means
[1:09:38] from the time of Genesis the first
[1:09:40] chapter when the Bible said in the
[1:09:42] beginning God created the heaven and the
[1:09:44] earth there was Jesus Christ all the way
[1:09:46] down to the the revelations the 22nd
[1:09:49] chapter and the 21st verse when the
[1:09:51] Bible said amen. It was God. It was
[1:09:54] Jesus. He was the amen of God. From the
[1:09:56] first verse to the last verse everywhere
[1:09:58] you look you ought to see Jesus Christ.
[1:10:01] He said when we look we must see Christ.
[1:10:03] Friends let me tell you about this
[1:10:04] morning. That's why many people struggle
[1:10:06] with being a believer. And they struggle
[1:10:08] because they haven't got to a place in
[1:10:10] order to look at it in a way that they
[1:10:12] can be a believer. They they don't see
[1:10:14] Christ because they're looking from a
[1:10:16] denominational standpoint. They can look
[1:10:18] at this same message. I may as well
[1:10:19] preach it anyway. But but you can look
[1:10:21] at this message out of somebody else's
[1:10:23] point of view and you may not see
[1:10:24] Christ. You can look at it out of some
[1:10:26] creed and you might not see Christ. You
[1:10:28] can look at it out of some man-made
[1:10:30] theology and you may not see Christ. But
[1:10:32] if you could ever get to the altar of
[1:10:33] the Lord and look up at the message that
[1:10:36] God has sent in this age, you will see
[1:10:38] Jesus Christ. I can't help to see
[1:10:40] nothing but Christ. Everywhere I look in
[1:10:43] it, brother Mah, I see Christ. Let Let
[1:10:45] me tell you, friend, when you look at
[1:10:46] the message, you I don't see a man. I
[1:10:49] see Jesus Christ. I can see past the
[1:10:51] flesh or the veil of flesh that God has
[1:10:53] placed upon this earth and see what
[1:10:55] Jesus Christ has done in this age.
[1:10:58] &gt;&gt; I think many has missed the purpose of
[1:11:00] the message. Can I just say it like
[1:11:02] this? Can I just say this? The purpose
[1:11:04] of the message is not to say that there
[1:11:07] is a message. Hello.
[1:11:09] &gt;&gt; The purpose of a message wasn't to say
[1:11:10] there is a message. The purpose of the
[1:11:12] message was to say that there is a God.
[1:11:15] &gt;&gt; It was to say that Jesus Christ is the
[1:11:18] same yesterday, today, and forever. The
[1:11:20] purpose of it, it wasn't to say there is
[1:11:21] one. It's to say there is a God.
[1:11:25] &gt;&gt; So as preachers, as ministers, say as
[1:11:27] ministers, we ought to preach the
[1:11:29] message. I believe that. Can you imagine
[1:11:31] if I was to give Connor a message and I
[1:11:35] wrote it down and I gave it to him. I
[1:11:37] said, "Conor, here's here's the the
[1:11:39] message from Brother Matt." Now, you you
[1:11:40] go spread that everywhere. And can you
[1:11:42] imagine if Brother Connor got up this is
[1:11:44] free this morning, but can you imagine
[1:11:46] if he went around to all of his friends
[1:11:47] and says, "Oh, buddy, if you only heard
[1:11:50] the message of Brother Matt, you
[1:11:52] wouldn't believe. Boy, this is Brother
[1:11:54] Matt has got a message." And my, it's
[1:11:56] the greatest man. It's so powerful. Oh,
[1:11:58] brother Matt, he wrote it down on paper
[1:11:59] and brother Matt gave it to me to to
[1:12:01] give to y'all. And oh my, if you just
[1:12:03] see what Brother Matt wrote. Oh, brother
[1:12:04] Matt. I mean, but what good would it do
[1:12:06] anybody? Nobody will rejoice. And
[1:12:08] Connor's telling them about Brother
[1:12:10] Matt's message and tell But what what
[1:12:12] good would it do them? But the
[1:12:13] difference is if Brother Connor would go
[1:12:15] and he would say, "I got a message from
[1:12:17] Brother Matt." He said that all of the
[1:12:19] kids get two suckers today after church
[1:12:21] instead of one. I I just cost myself
[1:12:24] $50.
[1:12:26] But the difference is is that the that
[1:12:29] telling about there's a difference in
[1:12:31] telling about a message and telling the
[1:12:33] message. There's a difference between
[1:12:35] between talking about something that God
[1:12:37] is doing and actually actually telling
[1:12:38] what God has done. See see so the
[1:12:40] purpose of the message wasn't to say
[1:12:42] that there is a message. The purpose of
[1:12:44] the message is to say it was to display
[1:12:46] Christ. It was that people could see
[1:12:48] Christ living in embodied in humanity
[1:12:51] again in this very age. I I think as
[1:12:53] ministers that's why we ought to preach
[1:12:55] the message. I I'm not here to preach
[1:12:57] about a message. I I think the day is
[1:12:59] long gone to preach about a message, but
[1:13:00] I I believe that we ought to preach the
[1:13:02] message. I believe we ought to not live
[1:13:04] we ought to live the message as
[1:13:06] disciples as believers. We ought to
[1:13:08] testify of the message of the hour. The
[1:13:10] lives that we live ought to testify of
[1:13:12] the very message of Jesus Christ that
[1:13:15] has came in this hour.
[1:13:17] &gt;&gt; We're not talking about a message, but
[1:13:18] we're living a message. We're preaching
[1:13:20] a message. We're But we're testifying
[1:13:22] about it. Isn't that what happened with
[1:13:23] the woman at the well? remember whenever
[1:13:25] she came and she she she witnessed or
[1:13:28] experienced this relationship with Jesus
[1:13:30] and whenever she went back into the
[1:13:32] town, the Bible said she went in there
[1:13:33] saying, "Come and see a man that has
[1:13:35] told me all that I've ever done."
[1:13:37] &gt;&gt; And you know what the Bible said that
[1:13:39] whenever she told them that that many of
[1:13:41] them believed on him because of her
[1:13:43] testimony,
[1:13:45] &gt;&gt; but after a little while when that she
[1:13:47] led them to him and they met him outside
[1:13:50] of the camp and they went and they met
[1:13:52] him, they came back. The Bible says when
[1:13:54] they came back that many more believed
[1:13:56] because of his own what? Of his own
[1:13:58] word.
[1:13:59] &gt;&gt; And they came back to her. In other
[1:14:01] words, her just telling them about it
[1:14:03] wasn't enough.
[1:14:04] &gt;&gt; But when they came back, they believed
[1:14:06] the more because they heard his own
[1:14:08] words. So he says, see, so and then they
[1:14:11] said to the woman, "Now we believe not
[1:14:13] because of your saying, but we believe
[1:14:16] because we have heard him ourself and we
[1:14:18] know that this is indeed the Christ, the
[1:14:21] savior of the world." You know what that
[1:14:23] tells me? That those people in that day
[1:14:25] had to get past the flesh of a man
[1:14:27] called Jesus Christ. And they had to
[1:14:29] hear the word that he was preaching. And
[1:14:31] they saw past the flesh and they heard
[1:14:34] his own word. And because of his word,
[1:14:36] they said, or can I just say it like
[1:14:38] this? They looked into the ministry that
[1:14:40] he was preaching. And because of his
[1:14:42] ministry, they saw his word and they saw
[1:14:44] Christ in his ministry. And because of
[1:14:46] his word, then they said, "Now we
[1:14:48] believe on him." said they got a
[1:14:50] revelation because they had seen Christ.
[1:14:53] They they had seen the Messiah. He
[1:14:55] wasn't known as a Christ. His name was
[1:14:57] Jesus. The Christ was the anointing that
[1:14:59] was upon him. That that's why we know
[1:15:01] him today as Jesus Christ. That's but
[1:15:03] whenever people met him, he didn't he
[1:15:05] wasn't walking around saying, "I'm
[1:15:06] Christ." That wasn't his last name. The
[1:15:08] Christ was the anointing up on him.
[1:15:10] That's who he was. That was that was his
[1:15:12] identification in the scripture. He was
[1:15:14] Christ the anointed one. So he said,
[1:15:16] "But now they believed he was Christ.
[1:15:18] They believe he was indeed that the
[1:15:19] anointed one because of his ministry
[1:15:22] because of his word. They recognize the
[1:15:24] anointing of Christ on the man Jesus.
[1:15:28] &gt;&gt; You realize why we're we we can see past
[1:15:30] the flesh. If they had to do that than
[1:15:31] that day, then how much more do we have
[1:15:33] to do that today? See, so so we we look
[1:15:36] past the flesh, brother Mark, for one
[1:15:38] purpose is because we want to see
[1:15:40] Christ. See, that's why when I look at
[1:15:43] this, I I see Jesus Christ. When I look
[1:15:45] at the Bible, every verse I see Christ.
[1:15:47] How many can say that this morning?
[1:15:49] Every verse of scripture, it don't
[1:15:50] matter what you read about, you can find
[1:15:52] Jesus in it because that's what it's
[1:15:54] about. You realize that all kinds of
[1:15:55] religions have part of our Bible. They
[1:15:57] they have the books of Moses. Even in
[1:15:59] Judaism, even many Muslims, they'll
[1:16:02] still read the same books of Moses and
[1:16:04] different things. A lot of the Bible
[1:16:05] that we have, they still have. But what
[1:16:07] they don't see in it is Jesus Christ.
[1:16:09] Because but but when we read it as
[1:16:11] believers, we can go right back in the
[1:16:13] same story and say, "But but where you
[1:16:15] missed it is that was talking about
[1:16:16] Jesus." And and why you why you didn't
[1:16:18] never go further is because that was
[1:16:20] actually talking about Jesus. And why
[1:16:21] you're still living under that law is
[1:16:23] because that was talking about Jesus.
[1:16:26] &gt;&gt; So see, every time I look at the Bible,
[1:16:27] I see Jesus Christ. But let me tell you
[1:16:29] this, friends. When I look at the
[1:16:31] message, I see the same thing because
[1:16:33] I'm looking for Christ to be manifested
[1:16:35] in this age. It was prophesied in
[1:16:37] Zechariah 14 that it would happen in
[1:16:39] this time. So I'm looking for that.
[1:16:41] That's what we're looking for as
[1:16:42] believers. And because we're looking for
[1:16:44] that, then that is what we see. That
[1:16:46] means when we look at the message,
[1:16:47] brother Mar, I see Christ manifested in
[1:16:50] human flesh again. I see Hebrews 13:8. I
[1:16:53] see the same pillar of fire. I'm not
[1:16:55] looking at something else. I'm not
[1:16:56] looking at something that was different
[1:16:57] than the Bible. It is Jesus Christ. It
[1:17:00] is the book of Acts continued in this
[1:17:02] age that we live in. I see the same
[1:17:04] pillar of fire that was on the road to
[1:17:06] Damascus that came down to Paul. I see
[1:17:08] the same one that spoke to Moses that
[1:17:10] said, "Take off your shoes cuz you're
[1:17:12] standing on holy ground." I see the same
[1:17:14] covenant that God gave to Abraham,
[1:17:16] present again among the church. I see
[1:17:18] the ministry of Eleazar that went down
[1:17:20] to call a bride for Isaac. I I I I see
[1:17:24] the same spirit that was upon Elijah
[1:17:26] when he went up to those prophets of
[1:17:27] Baal and he said, "Let the God that
[1:17:29] answerth by fire, let him be the God.
[1:17:33] &gt;&gt; Let him be the one that we serve."
[1:17:35] &gt;&gt; Let me tell you, the spirit of Elijah
[1:17:37] didn't just remain with Elijah.
[1:17:40] &gt;&gt; Hello, somebody. It didn't just remain
[1:17:42] with Elijah for the Bible says that that
[1:17:44] mantel fell back upon Elisha. You said,
[1:17:46] "Well, how do you know that that that
[1:17:47] that same power was still with Elisha?"
[1:17:50] Because when he walked down to the water
[1:17:51] to the River Jordan and he laid the
[1:17:53] mantel upon the water, he said, "Where
[1:17:55] is the Lord God of Elijah?" It wasn't
[1:17:58] that he had lost God, but he was he was
[1:18:01] making a statement to manifest the very
[1:18:03] act that was about to be done was the
[1:18:05] same God that was in Elijah. And that
[1:18:08] was the same God that was present in
[1:18:10] Elisha. And friends, I'll say this. It's
[1:18:11] the same God today. That's why you can't
[1:18:14] tell believers that the spirit of God
[1:18:16] don't remain with man. I know that's
[1:18:17] what the devil tries to do. Well, the
[1:18:19] spirit of God ain't here no more and he
[1:18:21] don't remain with man. He was just with
[1:18:23] the disciples and all that, but we're
[1:18:24] believers this morning. And there ain't
[1:18:26] nobody going to tell sister Debbie that
[1:18:28] the spirit of God don't remain with man.
[1:18:30] There there ain't nobody going to tell
[1:18:31] brother Juan that the spirit of God
[1:18:33] don't remain with man. There ain't
[1:18:34] nobody going to tell brother David that
[1:18:36] the spirit of God doesn't remain with
[1:18:38] man.
[1:18:39] We're too much believers. You can't tell
[1:18:41] us that stuff. We We're believers. Jesus
[1:18:43] said, "I'll go away, but I'll send a
[1:18:45] comforter to you." The spirit of God
[1:18:47] remains with man. He said, "The works
[1:18:49] that I do shall you do also." The spirit
[1:18:51] of God remains with man. When you
[1:18:53] receive the Holy Ghost, you will be
[1:18:54] endued with power from on high.
[1:18:57] &gt;&gt; The spirit of God remains with man. I
[1:18:59] say this, the works of Jesus Christ are
[1:19:01] still being done today.
[1:19:04] &gt;&gt; They're still being done today.
[1:19:06] &gt;&gt; Say, "Well, I haven't seen it." Well,
[1:19:08] maybe you're just looking from the wrong
[1:19:09] place.
[1:19:11] &gt;&gt; Still being done today. And it's meant
[1:19:13] for you to see him.
[1:19:15] &gt;&gt; Do you believe that?
[1:19:18] &gt;&gt; That's been God's purpose all along
[1:19:21] is to see Christ.
[1:19:23] &gt;&gt; That's why Paul would say, therefore, he
[1:19:26] said God exalted him to the highest
[1:19:27] place. Gave him a name above all names
[1:19:31] that the name at the name of Jesus that
[1:19:34] every knee would bow.
[1:19:36] Everywhere we look, we see Christ.
[1:19:39] &gt;&gt; He's exalted him.
[1:19:40] &gt;&gt; Isn't that what took place on Mount
[1:19:43] Transfiguration? Remember with Bobby and
[1:19:45] Peter and James and John, they went with
[1:19:46] Jesus to the mountain. The Bible says,
[1:19:48] "But while they were there, all of a
[1:19:50] sudden, he was lifted up."
[1:19:52] &gt;&gt; You see what God was doing? He said he
[1:19:53] was lifted up. His face shone as the
[1:19:55] sun. His way arignment was white like
[1:19:58] snow. And here whenever they looked on
[1:20:00] him, then came Moses and Elijah. You
[1:20:02] remember what Peter done whenever he saw
[1:20:03] it? He got something stirred up in his
[1:20:05] heart and you know he said you know what
[1:20:07] I'm gonna do I'm gonna build three
[1:20:09] tabernacles right here on this mountain.
[1:20:10] I'm gonna build one for Moses, one for
[1:20:12] Elijah and one for Jesus. But remember
[1:20:15] said what it's just like man. He saw the
[1:20:17] supernatural one to make a denomination
[1:20:19] separate everybody. Said isn't that the
[1:20:21] way? Isn't that the way that men think?
[1:20:22] He said he was trying to do a good thing
[1:20:24] but it turned out it wouldn't have been
[1:20:25] a good thing but I'm going to build a
[1:20:27] tabernacle for Moses and a tabernacle
[1:20:28] for Elijah. Said but he couldn't have
[1:20:30] done that. But here while he thought on
[1:20:31] these things or he began to speak about
[1:20:33] it and and I'm going to build this and I
[1:20:35] I'm going to make a church on this holy
[1:20:37] mountain and my it was the place where
[1:20:39] Jesus had came and Moses and Elijah can
[1:20:41] you imagine what a place can you imagine
[1:20:43] if that was you in that place no doubt
[1:20:45] we might have thought the same thing
[1:20:46] said but he was but he was thinking
[1:20:48] about that I'm going to build a
[1:20:49] tabernacle on this holy mountain well
[1:20:51] some the reality is the the mountain
[1:20:53] wasn't holy anyway brother Bobby there
[1:20:55] was nothing holy about the mountain you
[1:20:56] can go to that same mountain today it's
[1:20:58] not a holy mountain the only thing that
[1:21:00] made it holy was the presence of God on
[1:21:02] the mountain.
[1:21:03] &gt;&gt; And because he was there and he was
[1:21:05] going, he said, "I'm going to make a
[1:21:06] tabernacle for Moses, a tabernacle for
[1:21:08] Elijah, and a tabernacle for Jesus." But
[1:21:10] then while he would say that, all of a
[1:21:12] sudden, they heard a voice out of
[1:21:14] heaven. And he said, "This is my beloved
[1:21:16] son in whom I am well pleased. Hear ye
[1:21:19] him." So listen what he was trying.
[1:21:22] Listen what God corrected the error to
[1:21:24] keep them from doing what many still try
[1:21:26] to do today. said they were going to
[1:21:28] build a tabernacle for Moses, a
[1:21:30] tabernacle for Elijah, and a tabernacle
[1:21:33] for Jesus. Said, but see, but but when
[1:21:35] the God came, he corrected it. The voice
[1:21:36] spoke, he corrected it. He said, "In him
[1:21:38] I am well pleased. Hear ye him." In
[1:21:41] other words, there ain't no room for any
[1:21:43] other tabernacle. There's no room for a
[1:21:45] tabernacle for Moses. There's no room
[1:21:47] for a tabernacle for for Elijah. And I
[1:21:50] love, Brother B said, I am so glad that
[1:21:52] he said that. He said here when they
[1:21:55] were thinking about it, I'm going to
[1:21:56] build a tabernacle for Moses. It sounded
[1:21:58] like a good idea, but God spoke. He
[1:22:00] said, but in here's my beloved son. In
[1:22:02] him I am well pleased. Hear ye him. And
[1:22:04] brother said, I'm so glad he said it, he
[1:22:06] said, the reason I'm glad, he said, cuz
[1:22:08] how would you try like to try and keep
[1:22:11] the law? How would you like to be a part
[1:22:13] of the tabernacle of Moses and had to
[1:22:15] live your whole life trying to keep the
[1:22:16] law? He said, cuz no man is justified by
[1:22:19] the law. No flesh can be saved by the
[1:22:21] law. The law had no salvation. The law
[1:22:24] is not a tabernacle of praise. In other
[1:22:26] words, there ain't no rejoicing around
[1:22:29] the law. It ain't a tabernacle of
[1:22:31] praise. Brother said the law was a
[1:22:33] prison house.
[1:22:34] &gt;&gt; Somebody say, "Amen."
[1:22:35] &gt;&gt; The law was a prison house. He said,
[1:22:37] "And the law come and told you you was a
[1:22:39] sinner and it put you in jail, but it
[1:22:41] just didn't have the power to bring you
[1:22:43] out." He said, "And I don't want to be a
[1:22:45] prisoner." He said, "And that's what the
[1:22:46] law does. It shuts you up. It condemns
[1:22:48] you. Thou shalt not. If you do, you're
[1:22:50] in prison. There ain't no way of getting
[1:22:52] out. He said, I wouldn't want the law,
[1:22:54] but Peter wanted to build a denomination
[1:22:56] and call it the law worshippers.
[1:22:59] &gt;&gt; Come on.
[1:23:00] &gt;&gt; What good would it have done?
[1:23:02] &gt;&gt; He said he wanted to build a a
[1:23:03] tabernacle of Moses called the law
[1:23:05] worshippers. And then the other one, you
[1:23:06] say, well, what about the one of Elijah?
[1:23:08] You know what Elijah was? Elijah was
[1:23:10] God's hand of justice in the time that
[1:23:12] Elijah lived. He said, see, Elijah
[1:23:14] represented God's justice. He said, in
[1:23:16] other words, he was a stern line of
[1:23:18] God's justice. He was the one that
[1:23:19] brought justice to Ahab and Jezebel.
[1:23:21] Remember when the 50 soldiers came to
[1:23:23] kill Elijah and he brought fire down to
[1:23:25] kill him. And then they came they when
[1:23:26] they came again he raised up said he
[1:23:29] raised up under the power of justice and
[1:23:31] brought fire down and consumed them men
[1:23:33] and killed them. He said so see that
[1:23:35] ain't what we want at all. Said we don't
[1:23:38] want justice. I mean how many walk
[1:23:40] around and say Lord I want I mean I I've
[1:23:42] heard people like that but the reality
[1:23:44] is it's not really true. Any of us could
[1:23:46] say, "Well, I want God to be just, and I
[1:23:48] want I want the justice of God on my No,
[1:23:50] no, you don't. You don't want the
[1:23:51] justice of God. What we really want is
[1:23:53] the mercy of God." He said, "See, he
[1:23:55] tried to build a house of law. He tried
[1:23:57] to build a house of justice." He said,
[1:23:59] "But he he said, but really, I don't
[1:24:01] want justice." He said, Elijah was a
[1:24:03] stern line of God's justice. He said,
[1:24:04] "We don't want that. I don't want
[1:24:06] justice. I just want mercy. We want the
[1:24:10] mercy of God." He said, "That's all we
[1:24:12] want. We want the mercy. It's always
[1:24:13] mercy." And the voice from heaven come,
[1:24:16] he said, "Let the denomination go." He
[1:24:18] said, "What did he say? This is my
[1:24:19] beloved son. Hear ye him." He said,
[1:24:21] "What did Christ represent?" He said,
[1:24:23] "He represented God's love." He said,
[1:24:25] "And that's what I want. I don't want
[1:24:27] justice. I don't want judgment. I don't
[1:24:29] want the law. I want God's love and
[1:24:32] mercy on me." How many can say amen to
[1:24:34] that? I'm not after the judgment of God.
[1:24:37] I'm not after the justice of God. I'm
[1:24:39] not after the law of God. And I
[1:24:40] certainly ain't going to hold that over
[1:24:42] people. But what we really want is the
[1:24:44] love of God and the mercy of God to be
[1:24:46] shined upon our life that would bring us
[1:24:48] out of the the darkness of condemnation
[1:24:51] into the light of God's revealed word.
[1:24:54] &gt;&gt; That's what we really want. The mercy of
[1:24:56] God. You see, that was God's real
[1:24:59] desire. What God really wanted to do, he
[1:25:01] couldn't do it with Moses. He couldn't
[1:25:03] do it with Elijah, but he could only do
[1:25:05] it with Jesus Christ. Isn't that
[1:25:06] powerful? Said he was trying to build
[1:25:08] all these churches, but really there
[1:25:10] ain't but one that we're really after.
[1:25:11] is Jesus Christ. He said, "God wanted to
[1:25:14] bless his children and God can't Can I
[1:25:16] just read this? I may as well. We're
[1:25:18] here." But God can't bless his children
[1:25:20] under a law.
[1:25:23] &gt;&gt; See, God wanted to bless his children,
[1:25:25] but God can't bless his children under
[1:25:27] justice.
[1:25:28] &gt;&gt; Said, "But the only way that God can
[1:25:30] bless his children is under the love of
[1:25:33] his son, Jesus Christ."
[1:25:35] &gt;&gt; Said, "This is my beloved son in whom I
[1:25:38] am well pleased. Hear ye him." Paul
[1:25:41] said, "It pleased the Father that in
[1:25:42] Christ that all the fullness would
[1:25:44] dwell." It pleased the Father, having
[1:25:46] made peace through the blood of the
[1:25:47] cross. It pleased the Father that by him
[1:25:49] to reconcile all things to himself,
[1:25:52] whether they be things in earth or
[1:25:53] things in heaven. Can I say this this
[1:25:55] morning? In other words, it pleases God
[1:25:57] to preach the message of Jesus Christ.
[1:25:59] This great message that God has sent in
[1:26:01] this hour, which was the message of
[1:26:03] Jesus Christ in the age that we're
[1:26:05] living in. What a revelation. What a
[1:26:07] what a light, brother David Paul. the
[1:26:10] very thing that would take you right
[1:26:11] into God's grace. And God has sent it in
[1:26:13] this age and it pleases God to preach
[1:26:15] the message of Jesus Christ.
[1:26:18] &gt;&gt; Satan has always tried to destroy it.
[1:26:20] You You realize he's always He's always
[1:26:21] tried to destroy the purpose of God.
[1:26:24] &gt;&gt; That's always been the enemy to destroy
[1:26:26] his purpose. But do you realize that no
[1:26:28] matter how hard he tries, God is still
[1:26:30] going to have a people.
[1:26:31] &gt;&gt; He's still going to have a bride.
[1:26:32] They're still going to be believers. It
[1:26:34] don't matter how much you've gone
[1:26:36] through to get to where you are this
[1:26:37] morning or what brought you here this
[1:26:39] morning. But he's still going to have a
[1:26:40] a bride. There's still overcomers in
[1:26:42] Leodysa. There's still going to be a
[1:26:44] believers. There's still going to be a
[1:26:46] rapture. There's still saints that are
[1:26:48] going to that are going to rapture all
[1:26:49] this earth and one morning between 6 and
[1:26:51] 9, they're going to get up out of this
[1:26:52] old flesh to this pest house of the
[1:26:54] flesh and they're going to put their
[1:26:56] feet and and step up a little bit
[1:26:57] higher. It's still coming. No matter how
[1:27:00] bad the Satan don't want it to happen,
[1:27:02] it's still happening.
[1:27:04] It's God's word
[1:27:06] &gt;&gt; and he sent a reminder. He sent a the
[1:27:08] message this message of Jesus Christ was
[1:27:10] sent in this age for that very that
[1:27:12] therefore we're not ashamed to say I'm a
[1:27:14] message believer. I'm not ashamed to say
[1:27:17] I believe the message of the hour.
[1:27:19] Brother Mark because I recognize what
[1:27:20] the message was. It was the reality of
[1:27:23] Jesus Christ living in this age that I'm
[1:27:25] living in. It's the very thing that
[1:27:27] brought me out of the world and gave me
[1:27:29] a path to walk back into the redemption
[1:27:31] of God.
[1:27:33] Therefore, I can say it. I'm happy to be
[1:27:36] a message believer.
[1:27:38] &gt;&gt; Amen. How many believers do we have here
[1:27:40] this morning?
[1:27:41] &gt;&gt; What a wonderful message we have. So,
[1:27:43] there's only one message. It was the
[1:27:45] message of Jesus Christ. Paul said, "No
[1:27:47] man can build on any other foundation,
[1:27:49] no more than what's already been laid,
[1:27:50] and that is Christ Jesus." But Abraham
[1:27:53] preached his whole message. He said,
[1:27:54] "And I preached what Paul preached."
[1:27:58] &gt;&gt; See, it was Christ Jesus. Paul said, "I
[1:28:01] am persuaded that neither death nor life
[1:28:03] could set angels or principalities, nor
[1:28:05] powers, nor things present, nor things
[1:28:06] to come, nor height, or depth, or any
[1:28:08] other creature should be able to
[1:28:10] separate us from the love of God, which
[1:28:13] is in Christ Jesus our Lord." Now, isn't
[1:28:16] that powerful to think about this
[1:28:18] morning? You know, you can be separated.
[1:28:20] Men was separated from God. There was a
[1:28:22] great chasm that separated man from God.
[1:28:25] It wasn't that they couldn't be
[1:28:26] separated from God, but Paul said, "I'm
[1:28:29] persuaded that they couldn't be
[1:28:30] separated from the love of God."
[1:28:32] &gt;&gt; There may have been times in our life
[1:28:34] when you were disconnected from God.
[1:28:36] There's times in our our life that God
[1:28:38] he wasn't speaking to you. He wasn't it
[1:28:40] wasn't God dealing with you. It was you
[1:28:42] you you get so wrapped in the world and
[1:28:43] and maybe you was running another way.
[1:28:45] There was a time of our life we were
[1:28:46] separated from God. But isn't that
[1:28:48] something to think? But I was never
[1:28:49] separated from his love. He said that's
[1:28:52] the real message of Jesus Christ is the
[1:28:54] love and the mercy of God. So see we
[1:28:56] were never separated to that but even
[1:28:59] even in our even in our sin. The Bible
[1:29:01] said even in our sin and even in our
[1:29:03] trespasses that he still loved us.
[1:29:08] &gt;&gt; I think it's wonderful.
[1:29:09] &gt;&gt; Think what a message that we have. But
[1:29:12] said then what should we be this
[1:29:13] morning? He said we are the children of
[1:29:15] his promise. We being dead in Christ, we
[1:29:18] are Abraham's seeds and we're hes with
[1:29:19] him with the promise that no matter how
[1:29:21] much sickness comes, how kind of a death
[1:29:23] that we die. How much poverty we go
[1:29:25] through, God's purpose cannot be
[1:29:27] defeated. He will raise us up again.
[1:29:30] Hallelujah.
[1:29:31] &gt;&gt; He said he will raise us up again.
[1:29:33] Because I live, you shall live also. He
[1:29:35] said, and that is our hope.
[1:29:38] &gt;&gt; Brother Mark, we're not living
[1:29:39] wandering, but there's been a light that
[1:29:41] has shown in our hearts.
[1:29:44] the purpose of God will come to pass in
[1:29:46] our life. You know, I I I'll finish with
[1:29:49] this story this morning. But you
[1:29:51] remember the story of Ruth and how that
[1:29:54] there was a part of the life of Ruth
[1:29:56] that she didn't even know that she was a
[1:29:58] part of God's purpose.
[1:30:00] &gt;&gt; You ever think of that? She didn't even
[1:30:02] know she was just going through life and
[1:30:03] living life and and and doing all the
[1:30:06] what whatever come her way. She didn't
[1:30:07] even know she was a part of God's
[1:30:09] purpose. But but the the the the the
[1:30:11] Bible would tell us that she came to
[1:30:13] Bethlehem here at the beginning of the
[1:30:15] barley harvest. She was she was
[1:30:17] searching for a field to glean in and
[1:30:19] how how that remember you remember the
[1:30:20] story how she happened upon the field of
[1:30:22] Boaz and and you know and how you know
[1:30:25] maybe she would question that when she
[1:30:26] went there so so insecure about what had
[1:30:29] brought her to this particular field and
[1:30:31] all the questions that was in her heart
[1:30:32] and am I in the right place and am I am
[1:30:35] I following God's plan and am I gleaning
[1:30:37] in the right field? Is God is it God
[1:30:39] that that really brought me here and all
[1:30:41] these questions were in her heart until
[1:30:44] Boaz came into the picture?
[1:30:46] &gt;&gt; I think this is so powerful to think
[1:30:48] that here the questions that would be
[1:30:50] because she was a human being and
[1:30:52] because she had left her home and she
[1:30:53] had had went to another place and she
[1:30:55] had gone into another field and she was
[1:30:57] searching for something, searching uh
[1:30:59] for fulfillment in her life and
[1:31:00] searching for a purpose and and wanting
[1:31:02] uh God to be able to lead her and here
[1:31:04] that she had made a commitment.
[1:31:05] Remember, she told Naomi, "Your God will
[1:31:07] be my God. Your people will be my
[1:31:09] people. I'm going to serve God with you.
[1:31:10] I'm going to put a shoulder to the
[1:31:11] wheel. I I'll die. You can I'll die with
[1:31:14] you guys. I I'm going to serve God. I'm
[1:31:16] going to be there the whole time. Your
[1:31:17] God's going to be my God." Said, but she
[1:31:20] still would have a question in her heart
[1:31:22] until Boaz came in the picture. And when
[1:31:25] Boaz came in the picture, notice what
[1:31:26] Boaz done. He took the question out of
[1:31:29] the heart of Ruth. That's what we're
[1:31:31] waiting on all the time. We're waiting
[1:31:32] for the Boaz to come in the picture and
[1:31:35] to say that's the right thing and and
[1:31:36] you're in the right field and you're
[1:31:38] where I I called you to be and this is
[1:31:40] where I wanted you to be this morning
[1:31:42] and this is your purpose in your life.
[1:31:44] We're waiting on Boaz to come in the
[1:31:45] picture
[1:31:47] &gt;&gt; to vindicate that we are in the right
[1:31:49] place. So this is what she was waiting
[1:31:51] on the whole time she would she would
[1:31:52] wait. But when Boaz came in the picture,
[1:31:54] no longer would she wonder, you know,
[1:31:56] cuz I could just see her maybe maybe I
[1:31:58] can stay here, Brother Ela. Maybe, you
[1:31:59] know, maybe they'll let me stay. I don't
[1:32:01] know. Maybe somebody will come here in a
[1:32:02] few minutes and kick me out of this
[1:32:04] field. I might not be able to stay. I
[1:32:06] might not even belong. I might not be
[1:32:07] able to survive. I might not be able to
[1:32:09] to get enough uh uh barley to be able to
[1:32:11] uh to make anything to eat. I I don't
[1:32:13] know. There's so many unknowns.
[1:32:15] &gt;&gt; But when Boaz came in the picture, you
[1:32:18] realize that he changed the whole
[1:32:19] attitude of Ruth because Ruth wasn't
[1:32:21] looking to thrive in the field of Boaz.
[1:32:23] She was just looking to survive. When
[1:32:24] she came there, she was looking for
[1:32:26] survival. She was running for her life.
[1:32:28] She was she was hungry. She was starving
[1:32:30] for food. She was she was she was
[1:32:31] searching for something.
[1:32:33] &gt;&gt; But God had a different purpose for her.
[1:32:35] &gt;&gt; He wasn't just letting her come there to
[1:32:37] survive. He brought her there to thrive.
[1:32:39] &gt;&gt; And whenever she came there and she went
[1:32:41] to glean in she took a little bite a
[1:32:43] little bit, a little You notice the
[1:32:45] Bible say, "Oh, glory." That she'd ever
[1:32:47] seen Boaz. It was Boaz that saw her. But
[1:32:49] here she was gleaning in the field. And
[1:32:51] the Bible said, "But when Boaz came, he
[1:32:53] went straight to the leader of the
[1:32:54] field. He said, "Who is this woman? Who
[1:32:57] that this damsel that's over in the
[1:32:58] field? Who is she? what is her purpose
[1:33:00] here? And they got to telling telling
[1:33:02] Boaz about where she came from and who
[1:33:04] she belonged to and what her family
[1:33:06] lineage was. And Boaz said, "Don't y'all
[1:33:08] don't you let no man touch her. You keep
[1:33:10] her out of harm's way. You give her
[1:33:12] plenty of food. Anything she asked for,
[1:33:14] you give it to her." Then he went to to
[1:33:16] Ruth and he said, "I want you to know
[1:33:18] I've told the men to leave you alone. I
[1:33:20] I told them to make sure they give you
[1:33:22] plenty of food and if you get thirsty,
[1:33:24] you just go to the water barrel and get
[1:33:26] all you want to drink. And if you're
[1:33:28] hungry, you come to the master's table
[1:33:30] and you get all you want to eat.
[1:33:33] &gt;&gt; Boaz saw Ruth differently than Ruth saw
[1:33:35] Ruth.
[1:33:36] &gt;&gt; She saw herself as a gleaner. She saw
[1:33:39] herself as one that was trying to
[1:33:40] survive. But when Boaz saw her among all
[1:33:43] of the gleaners that when Boaz saw her,
[1:33:46] he called her unto himself and brought
[1:33:48] her to be his own bride.
[1:33:52] &gt;&gt; Have all the food. Think about it. He
[1:33:54] called her from among the gleaners. I'm
[1:33:56] here. He came in. He said, I'm here to
[1:33:58] pay the price. I'll give you what you
[1:34:01] I'll give you what you're really worth.
[1:34:02] You're you're you're more than a
[1:34:03] gleaner.
[1:34:04] &gt;&gt; You realize there's a whole field, a
[1:34:06] whole world of gleaners.
[1:34:08] &gt;&gt; So, but but but he called Ruth out of a
[1:34:11] field of gleaners
[1:34:13] &gt;&gt; and made her his own.
[1:34:15] &gt;&gt; He He repositioned her in this field
[1:34:18] &gt;&gt; as the bride of Boaz. I thought my here
[1:34:22] no wonder whenever she looked at Boaz
[1:34:24] she would say but why have I found grace
[1:34:26] in thy sight because she didn't feel
[1:34:28] like that she was worthy of being the
[1:34:31] the wife of a Boaz or worthy uh of being
[1:34:34] elevated among among the gleaners. She
[1:34:36] just was trying to be a gleaner. She was
[1:34:38] just trying to survive. But why have I
[1:34:41] found grace in thy sight? Can I say this
[1:34:45] this morning?
[1:34:46] &gt;&gt; She found more grace than she was
[1:34:48] looking for.
[1:34:50] She was looking for him to let her alone
[1:34:51] and just let her glean. But she found
[1:34:53] more grace than she was looking for.
[1:34:56] &gt;&gt; See, because she was a part of God's
[1:34:58] greater purpose here. She was she just
[1:35:00] said, "I want somebody that'll let me
[1:35:02] glean. I I want enough to eat just to
[1:35:04] get by." But but but Boaz, when Boaz saw
[1:35:06] her, he said, "I want her to own the
[1:35:08] field. I want her to I want her to have
[1:35:10] all that she wants. I I want her to
[1:35:12] possess this field. I want to give it to
[1:35:14] her."
[1:35:15] &gt;&gt; It was love at first sight.
[1:35:18] Friends, let me tell you this this
[1:35:19] morning. I don't even believe that grace
[1:35:22] found Ruth in the field of Boaz. I
[1:35:26] believe because she said, "Why have I
[1:35:27] found I don't believe that grace found
[1:35:28] her in the field of Boaz." I believe it
[1:35:30] was grace that found her in the land of
[1:35:31] Moab.
[1:35:33] &gt;&gt; And it was grace that called her caused
[1:35:35] her whenever Naomi said, "I'm going to
[1:35:36] Bethlehem." It was grace that said,
[1:35:38] "Okay, I'm going to follow you. Why are
[1:35:40] you going after me, Ruth?" It was the
[1:35:42] grace of God in her life that caused her
[1:35:44] to follow Naomi into the land of
[1:35:46] Bethlehem. It was grace that caused her
[1:35:48] to say, "Your people are going to meet
[1:35:50] my people." It was grace that caused her
[1:35:52] to say, "Your God is going to meet my
[1:35:54] God. I haven't even met this God, but I
[1:35:56] already love him. I already want to
[1:35:58] serve him. I want to give my all to him.
[1:35:59] I want him to be my God."
[1:36:02] &gt;&gt; She had never met him. But something in
[1:36:04] her, you say, "What was it?" It was the
[1:36:05] grace of God,
[1:36:08] &gt;&gt; the purpose of God in her life. Brother
[1:36:09] Mark, it encouraged her to follow Naomi
[1:36:12] and leave her past behind and go into
[1:36:14] this field for to fulfill the very
[1:36:16] purpose of God. And let me tell you
[1:36:18] friends, whenever she came there,
[1:36:20] wherever you go, I'll go, she went right
[1:36:22] into the field. And when she came there
[1:36:23] to Bethlehem, you realize that Bethlehem
[1:36:26] was known as the house of God's bread.
[1:36:28] &gt;&gt; And and you know, I think this is so
[1:36:30] powerful. And I'm and I'm closing. I
[1:36:31] think this is so powerful here. It was
[1:36:33] the house of God's bread. But do you
[1:36:35] realize that the the field that she came
[1:36:37] not only into Bethlehem, but she just
[1:36:40] happened to come into the field of the
[1:36:42] redeemer, the Lord of the harvest. So
[1:36:44] she came into the redeemer's field, the
[1:36:46] one that had the right to redeemer, the
[1:36:47] one what what a what a happen stance
[1:36:49] they say. What a what a chance that she
[1:36:51] just wandered into this particular
[1:36:52] field. What a what a happening meeting
[1:36:54] that she she came to this place. But
[1:36:56] see, she came to the field of the
[1:36:58] redeemer, which was Boaz. He had the the
[1:37:00] right as a redeemer to be able to
[1:37:02] purchase all all the debts and to be
[1:37:03] able to redeem her. But did you know
[1:37:05] that that here when she came to this
[1:37:07] field that Boaz's father, how many knows
[1:37:09] Boaz's father? He was Salmon. And Salmon
[1:37:12] was actually the founder of the city of
[1:37:15] Bethlehem. So not only was she in the
[1:37:17] field of the redeemer, but the father of
[1:37:19] the redeemer is the one that founded the
[1:37:21] whole place. So here the place that she
[1:37:23] goes to find her found herself in
[1:37:25] brother Wesley here was Bethlehem. The
[1:37:27] father had created this place. He had
[1:37:30] found it. He's the one that had made it.
[1:37:32] But then he had given the power to his
[1:37:35] son to possess the field and to and and
[1:37:37] the ability to be able to redeem. I
[1:37:39] thought my here she came to the house of
[1:37:41] Bethlehem into the field of the
[1:37:43] redeemer. The father had possessed it.
[1:37:45] He had given it to his son and now his
[1:37:47] son had the right to be able to redeem
[1:37:49] her and to and to establish her. I
[1:37:51] thought, isn't that the way it was? The
[1:37:53] creator of the house of bread is what
[1:37:55] gave his son the ability to redeem. He
[1:37:58] gave him the field. All that all all the
[1:38:00] ownership of the field was given to the
[1:38:02] son.
[1:38:04] &gt;&gt; Oh, let me tell you friends, that means
[1:38:05] if you're wandering around hopeless, you
[1:38:07] might feel like it, but you're not
[1:38:08] hopeless. It may seem like you you don't
[1:38:10] know where you're going or where you're
[1:38:12] going to end up or why. You may feel
[1:38:13] like it, but but it ain't hopeless. You
[1:38:15] may feel like I found this message by
[1:38:17] accident, but it was no accident that
[1:38:19] you came into this field. say, "Well,
[1:38:21] why did I come in the field?" Because
[1:38:23] God directed your path into this
[1:38:25] particular field.
[1:38:26] &gt;&gt; And no matter what condition that you
[1:38:28] were in, no matter what where you've
[1:38:30] ever been, do you realize you say, "But
[1:38:31] brother man, where is this field out?"
[1:38:33] Can I just be plain? If you belong to
[1:38:35] God, you'll never get away from God. It
[1:38:37] don't matter where you go, you can't run
[1:38:38] far enough to get away from God. You can
[1:38:40] glean in Arkansas. You can glean in
[1:38:42] Tennessee. You can glean in Europe. You
[1:38:44] can glean in Asia. It don't matter where
[1:38:46] you are. For my Bible said, the earth is
[1:38:48] the Lord's and the fullness thereof, the
[1:38:51] world and they that dwell therein. For
[1:38:53] he hath founded it upon the seas and
[1:38:56] established it upon the floods. That
[1:38:58] means the very ground that we walk on,
[1:39:00] it was created by the father in heaven.
[1:39:02] It was created by God. He possessor. He
[1:39:05] was the possessor of heaven and earth.
[1:39:07] So it don't matter if you're here or if
[1:39:09] you're sitting at home or if you're
[1:39:10] driving down the road or if you're at
[1:39:11] work or if you're at school, you're
[1:39:13] inhabiting a land that belongs to God.
[1:39:17] Hallelujah.
[1:39:18] &gt;&gt; It was created by God. But listen about
[1:39:20] God's field. But in the field that was
[1:39:22] created by the father, we've been
[1:39:24] redeemed by the son, Jesus Christ.
[1:39:28] &gt;&gt; For Paul said, "Neither by the blood of
[1:39:30] goats and calavs, but by his own blood,
[1:39:32] he entered in once into the holy place,
[1:39:34] having obtained an eternal redemption
[1:39:37] for us." Hallelujah. For it was if the
[1:39:40] blood of bulls and goats and ashes of a
[1:39:42] hepher and sprinkling of the unclean
[1:39:44] sanctifith the puring of the flesh, then
[1:39:47] how much more shall the blood of Christ
[1:39:49] who through the eternal spirit offered
[1:39:51] himself without spot to God? How much
[1:39:53] more can he purge your conscience from
[1:39:55] dead works to serve the living God?
[1:39:59] &gt;&gt; I read that and I think I wonder how
[1:40:02] long did Ruth live in the house of Boaz
[1:40:05] &gt;&gt; before the memories of Moab begin to
[1:40:07] fade.
[1:40:09] Hello, somebody.
[1:40:10] &gt;&gt; Before the the torment and things and
[1:40:13] the things that she had gone through in
[1:40:14] her life, let me tell you, it's a
[1:40:16] reality. I've been serving the Lord for
[1:40:18] many years. But still yet, I had a I had
[1:40:21] a past life, too. But how long as
[1:40:24] believers are you serving God and all of
[1:40:26] a sudden the past becomes a something so
[1:40:29] far away you don't it's a different
[1:40:31] person. It don't you're not even
[1:40:32] connected to it anymore. I my son's
[1:40:35] going to uh going to school and and you
[1:40:37] know I went up there and I opened the I
[1:40:39] I took him up there or went with the the
[1:40:41] day they meet all the parents and stuff
[1:40:42] and and when I went up there for for
[1:40:44] this time I opened the door there was a
[1:40:46] guy that walked out and I opened the
[1:40:47] door and I said here you go sir and I
[1:40:49] let him out and he said why are you
[1:40:50] calling me sir and you know all gruff
[1:40:52] and I said well I'm sorry sir I didn't I
[1:40:53] didn't I didn't mean nothing by it I was
[1:40:55] just trying to he said I graduated with
[1:40:57] you we're old pals how you don't even
[1:40:58] know who I am I I don't to this day I
[1:41:00] don't know who he was I didn't ask
[1:41:02] because I was embarrassed to say that.
[1:41:04] But, you know, I thought, isn't it maybe
[1:41:06] I just have a bad memory?
[1:41:08] &gt;&gt; Or maybe some things in your past that
[1:41:10] God just allows us to forget.
[1:41:12] &gt;&gt; Maybe there's some things that, you
[1:41:13] know, I don't know about y'all, but
[1:41:14] there were some things in my past I
[1:41:16] thank God I can't remember.
[1:41:18] &gt;&gt; You know, there, you know, some things I
[1:41:20] wouldn't say. Statute of limitations may
[1:41:21] not have went out on them yet. I used to
[1:41:24] be a teenager, too. I collected road
[1:41:26] signs. I know what it's like to be a be
[1:41:29] a teenager. But but I thank God that he
[1:41:32] can bring us to a place that our past is
[1:41:35] not even remembered no more. Do
[1:41:37] &gt;&gt; you believe that God I believe God can
[1:41:39] take you so far into the grace of Jesus
[1:41:41] Christ that all those things that haunt
[1:41:43] you and all that condemnation and the
[1:41:45] things that keep you attached to your
[1:41:46] past that every bit of it
[1:41:48] &gt;&gt; can go away.
[1:41:49] &gt;&gt; I believe we can get that deep in the
[1:41:51] blood
[1:41:51] &gt;&gt; of Jesus Christ. as our music players
[1:41:53] come. He said, "For this cause, he is
[1:41:55] the mediator of the New Testament, that
[1:41:58] by means of death, for the redemption of
[1:42:00] the transgressions that were under the
[1:42:02] first testament, they which are called
[1:42:05] might receive the promise of his eternal
[1:42:07] inheritance
[1:42:09] for the cause." He is the mediator of
[1:42:11] the New Testament. Isn't it powerful?
[1:42:13] for the redemption of our
[1:42:14] transgressions, that we're under the
[1:42:16] first testament, but we've been called
[1:42:19] in this hour that we might receive the
[1:42:20] promise of his eternal eternal
[1:42:23] inheritance.
[1:42:25] I say, as Ruth said this morning, why
[1:42:27] have I found grace in thy sight?
[1:42:29] &gt;&gt; Isn't that the way it makes you feel?
[1:42:32] How
[1:42:33] &gt;&gt; would somebody like me find grace like
[1:42:36] that?
[1:42:37] &gt;&gt; Lord, why have I found grace in thy
[1:42:40] sight? realize it wasn't something that
[1:42:42] you did.
[1:42:44] It's not by your merit, but it was him.
[1:42:49] But remember said Jesus was the light of
[1:42:51] the world and when he was here and he's
[1:42:54] the light of the world tonight.
[1:42:57] There's no other light that can ever
[1:42:59] lead us out of the shadows of death but
[1:43:02] the blessed Lord Jesus.
[1:43:04] I believe that this morning we've been
[1:43:06] called out of the shadows
[1:43:08] &gt;&gt; and into the light.
[1:43:10] He sent a wonderful
[1:43:13] powerful redeeming message.
[1:43:17] You know what the purpose of the message
[1:43:18] was? It was redemption.
[1:43:20] &gt;&gt; The very purpose
[1:43:22] &gt;&gt; he sent that for to call us into a
[1:43:25] relationship with God again. Won't you
[1:43:27] stand to your feet
[1:43:30] of the family of God?
[1:43:33] [Music]
[1:43:35] Born
[1:43:37] of his spirit,

[1:44:43] this morning? Oh, I'm so glad that I'm a
[1:44:48] part. If you can speak that from your
[1:44:50] heart. Lord, why have I found grace in
[1:44:52] thy sight? Well, I was washed
[1:44:56] in the fountain.
[1:44:59] I've been cleansed by his blood,
[1:45:04] joined

[1:47:15] &gt;&gt; I give
[1:47:17] &gt;&gt; Lord I just come to praise you Lord. I
[1:47:20] wonder how I found such grace Lord. I
[1:47:23] don't feel worthy of it. Lord, I just
[1:47:26] want to come and worship the truth.
[1:47:28] &gt;&gt; God, to tell you how I love you, Lord,
[1:47:31] because you first
[1:47:33] &gt;&gt; I bless your name,
[1:47:35] &gt;&gt; friend. Let me tell you, the law may not
[1:47:38] have been a tabernacle of praise, but
[1:47:40] the grace of Jesus Christ certainly is.
[1:47:43] It gives us a place to worship God. It
[1:47:45] has given us a real praise.
[1:47:50] If you should find
[1:47:55] that you're in the prison
[1:48:01] in your life,
[1:48:06] but reach out and pray.
[1:48:09] [Music]
[1:48:12] and defy those chains
[1:48:18] and they will fall
[1:48:24] in Jesus name. Amen. How many can defy
[1:48:27] the chains this morning? I said I bless
[1:48:30] your name.
[1:48:33] Yes, my Lord. I bless your name,
[1:48:40] Lord. I give you honor.

[1:49:17] &gt;&gt; Amen. How many How many feels like that
[1:49:20] this morning?
[1:49:22] &gt;&gt; Lord, why have I found grace in thy
[1:49:24] side? Amen. I believe that God has given
[1:49:27] us a pathway to redemption.
[1:49:30] &gt;&gt; Amen. We're not living lost in darkness,
[1:49:34] but there's such a revival. Why is there
[1:49:36] a revival in our heart? It's because of
[1:49:38] the light of the message.
[1:49:39] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:49:40] &gt;&gt; And we recognize what it is. And we can
[1:49:42] live it because we recognize who it is.
[1:49:46] &gt;&gt; Amen. You love the Lord this morning.
[1:49:47] You may you may go through many trials.
[1:49:49] You may had many hardships. And I don't
[1:49:52] know everybody's life. I don't know what
[1:49:54] you went through this week, last week,
[1:49:56] and job troubles. And you know, I think
[1:50:00] sometimes we get to a place we think
[1:50:03] it's going to be easy from now on.
[1:50:04] Finally got settled. And it's right then
[1:50:06] when everything falls apart. I thought I
[1:50:09] was supposed to retire and not have to
[1:50:10] do nothing. But here we are starting all
[1:50:11] over again. But God knows all things.
[1:50:15] Said, "So I don't believe there's
[1:50:16] anything that we go through that God
[1:50:18] don't have his hand in." Amen.
[1:50:21] &gt;&gt; He leads his children.
[1:50:23] How many feels like that God has a
[1:50:25] purpose for your life? Won't you raise
[1:50:27] your hand? If you don't feel like it,
[1:50:29] just go ahead and raise your hand and
[1:50:30] testify of it anyway
[1:50:31] &gt;&gt; because the devil's trying to keep you
[1:50:33] from feeling that way. But the real
[1:50:34] reality is is you really do.
[1:50:37] &gt;&gt; God has a purpose for every one of us.
[1:50:39] There's no we're no big ones and little
[1:50:40] ones. We all mean something to God. All
[1:50:42] around this world, God called children,
[1:50:46] believers, sons and daughters of God all
[1:50:47] over the world. That we all belong to
[1:50:50] God. And we all mean as much to God as
[1:50:52] the next one. Ministers, churches,
[1:50:54] preachers, people, lovely people. I
[1:50:57] thank God for every one of them. What a
[1:51:00] group. Wow. Isn't it Isn't it something
[1:51:02] to look across this world and think of
[1:51:04] the brothers and ministers that you know
[1:51:05] what a group to be a part of.
[1:51:08] &gt;&gt; The believers
[1:51:10] what a what a privilege it is. I say
[1:51:13] thank you Lord.
[1:51:14] &gt;&gt; I may be the least among them but Lord I
[1:51:16] thank you for all my brothers. I thank
[1:51:18] you for churches that just stand for the
[1:51:20] word of God. Lord I pray you would
[1:51:22] encourage them this morning. Lord I pray
[1:51:23] there'd be a revival in every assembly.
[1:51:26] I pray that the that the spirit of God
[1:51:28] would move throughout the land and it
[1:51:29] would put a revival in the heart of
[1:51:30] every believer. Lord, remind her who she
[1:51:33] is
[1:51:34] &gt;&gt; and where she come from and where she's
[1:51:35] going.
[1:51:36] &gt;&gt; Amen. I believe that tonight.
[1:51:41] [Music]
[1:51:42] &gt;&gt; So many times I've questioned
[1:51:45] &gt;&gt; certain circumstances,
[1:51:49] things I could not
[1:51:52] understand.
[1:51:56] Many times of trials,
[1:51:59] weakness
[1:52:02] &gt;&gt; and life's frustration get so out of
[1:52:06] hand.
[1:52:09] &gt;&gt; But it's I am reminded
[1:52:12] that I've never been forsaken
[1:52:16] and I' never had to stand one.
[1:52:23] When I look at all the victory,
[1:52:26] the spirit rises up in me. Yes. Through
[1:52:30] the fire, my weakness is made strong.
[1:52:35] For I know he never promised that the
[1:52:40] cross would not get heavy and the hill
[1:52:44] would not be hard to climb.
[1:52:51] He never offered
[1:52:54] victory without fighting. He said help
[1:52:58] would come in time.
[1:53:03] So remember when you're standing in the
[1:53:07] valley of decision and the adversary
[1:53:12] says give in.
[1:53:15] Just hold on.
[1:53:19] Our Lord will show up and he will take
[1:53:24] you through the fire again.
[1:53:28] [Music]
[1:53:31] Oh, I know that he never promised that
[1:53:36] the cross would not get heavy and the
[1:53:40] heel would not be hard to climb.
[1:53:47] He never offered
[1:53:49] a victory without fighting. He said,
[1:53:53] "Help would come in time."
[1:53:59] So remember when you're standing in the
[1:54:02] valley of decision and the adversary
[1:54:07] says give in.
[1:54:10] Just hold on.
[1:54:14] Our Lord will show up and he will take
[1:54:18] you through the fire. a minute. Can you
[1:54:22] not say that this morning? I know so
[1:54:25] many times I've questioned
[1:54:28] &gt;&gt; certain circumstances.
[1:54:30] &gt;&gt; How many can look across their life and
[1:54:32] ask that same thing?
[1:54:34] &gt;&gt; So many things that we don't have the
[1:54:36] answer to.
[1:54:37] &gt;&gt; Lord, why did I have to go through that
[1:54:39] in that way? Lord, what why did I have
[1:54:41] to suffer that pain and agony?
[1:54:43] &gt;&gt; But there's a purpose for all of us.
[1:54:46] &gt;&gt; It's God that's leading us.
[1:54:51] But then I am reminded
[1:54:56] for
[1:54:57] and I never had one test.
[1:55:03] And I look back at the victory. There's
[1:55:07] a spirit rises up.
[1:55:10] It's through the fire. Weakness is made
[1:55:14] strong.
[1:55:15] For I know he
[1:55:19] promised that the cross will not give me
[1:55:22] heavy.
[1:55:24] He will not be hard to climb.
[1:55:28] [Music]
[1:55:29] [Applause]
[1:55:31] He never offered
[1:55:33] victory without fighting. He said help
[1:55:40] in time.
[1:55:43] So remember when you're standing in the
[1:55:46] valley of decision
[1:55:49] and the adversary says give in
[1:55:55] just hold on
[1:55:57] [Music]
[1:56:03] take you through the fire
[1:56:05] &gt;&gt; one more time. Go ahead sing the chorus.
[1:56:10] He never promised that the cross would
[1:56:13] not get heavy and the hill would not be
[1:56:17] hard to love.
[1:56:23] &gt;&gt; He never offered
[1:56:26] victories without fighting. But he said
[1:56:29] help would always come in time.
[1:56:35] Remember to understand this is the
[1:56:39] valley of decision
[1:56:42] and the adversary says
[1:56:47] just hold on.
[1:56:51] Our Lord will show up.
[1:56:54] &gt;&gt; He will take you through the fire again.
[1:56:59] [Music]
[1:57:04] Hallelujah.
[1:57:07] &gt;&gt; Oh, just can you lift up your hands for
[1:57:08] a moment?
[1:57:13] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.

[1:57:19] hours.
