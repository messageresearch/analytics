[38:07] [music] and and just to hear the the
[38:10] just the the liberty of the gospel and
[38:13] [music] and my how it just liberates us
[38:15] from everything that we face whether it
[38:18] be natural or spiritual. This gospel has
[38:20] the answer. Amen. And I sure appreciate
[38:22] a man of God just for surrendering to

[38:29] And uh you know other other churches
[38:31] want him to preach to and uh there's
[38:33] [music] there's there's uh around the
[38:35] world try to try to get him and he's he
[38:38] has to be a lot of places. So we we

[40:06] uh they're not all called to to that
[40:08] kind of a thing, but a Christian is. A
[40:11] Christian is called to be a lighthouse.
[40:13] And we're called to [music] uh to take
[40:15] those in and bring those in that are
[40:17] struggling and and and have troubles.

[40:34] just pray that the [music] Lord can use
[40:35] me to be a help to somebody that they

[40:40] that kind of a person." Amen. I I want
[40:42] to be somebody that God can use uh to

[48:54] these thoughts, oh God. And Lord, that
[48:56] you would begin to minister to the needs
[48:57] of your children. Lord, I pray this
[49:00] morning those that are sick would be
[49:01] healed. [music]
[49:02] I pray those that are bound would be
[49:03] delivered, oh God. Lord, I pray those
[49:06] that are empty this morning would be
[49:07] filled with your dynamics, Lord. Father,
[49:10] we've not gathered here just to talk
[49:12] about [music] the mechanics, Lord. But
[49:13] father, we've come here that the
[49:15] dynamics might come into the mechanics,
[49:17] Lord. Lord, that it would make this word
[49:19] live. It would make this church move in
[49:21] the power, oh God, of your resurrection.
[49:24] Now, Lord, I pray maybe one at home
[49:26] listening this morning, may you reach
[49:28] down and touch them, dear God, may you,
[49:30] Lord, may you give them the desires of
[49:32] their heart. If there be one that's
[49:34] grown cold on you, Lord, I pray there
[49:36] would come a fire of God off the altar
[49:38] this morning. And Lord, it would touch
[49:40] the heart of those that have grown cold.
[49:42] And Lord, it would it would rekindle a
[49:44] fire, oh God, in their hearts to return,
[49:46] Lord, unto the paths of righteousness,
[49:49] oh God. And Lord, we're committing this
[49:50] meeting today in thy faithful hands.
[49:52] Forgive us, Lord, of our failures, Lord.
[49:54] Forgive us of our shortcomings.
[49:56] Transform us this morning by your word.
[49:58] And we'll be sure to give thee all the
[50:00] praise, all the honor, and all the
[50:01] glory. For it's in the wonderful name of
[50:03] our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ, we
[50:05] pray. And all the believers says,
[50:08] "Amen." And amen. God bless you this
[50:11] morning. And if you have your Bibles
[50:12] while you're standing with us, we want
[50:14] to go to the book of St. John, the 12th
[50:16] chapter. The book of St. John, the 12th
[50:18] chapter. I don't know if you can put
[50:20] some more lows in this. It's it's really
[50:22] changed on me. St. John chapter 12 and
[50:24] verse number 32. We sure Good to see
[50:27] everyone here in the house of God this
[50:28] morning. Those that have been away, good
[50:30] to see you here today. And how many is
[50:32] just happy to be a Christian?
[50:34] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. St. John chapter 12 and
[50:38] verse number 32. I want to look here
[50:40] again. And then also we're going to look
[50:41] in Colossians 3. But beginning here in
[50:44] St. John 12 and verse 32, Jesus
[50:46] speaking, he says, "And I, if I be
[50:50] lifted up from the earth," I want to
[50:52] just point that out again. He's very
[50:54] specific here.
[50:56] &gt;&gt; "And I, if I be lifted up from the
[50:58] earth, will draw all men unto me." In
[51:03] the book of Colossians, the third
[51:04] chapter.
[51:06] Colossians chapter 3. I want to look in
[51:09] the first verse of Colossians 3. A very,
[51:12] very familiar scripture to us all this
[51:14] morning. Colossians 3 and verse one.
[51:18] Paul here writing says, "If you then be
[51:21] risen with Christ, seek those things
[51:25] which are above, where Christ siteth on
[51:28] the right hand of God.
[51:31] Set your affection on things above and
[51:34] not on things on the earth.
[51:37] &gt;&gt; If you then be risen with Christ, then
[51:40] set your affection on things above and
[51:43] not on things on the earth. We ask the
[51:45] Lord this morning to bless the reading
[51:47] of his word as you can have your seat
[51:48] here this morning. Uh if the Lord would
[51:50] help me today, I want to continue on a
[51:53] little bit with the thought here. We
[51:54] were speaking on Wednesday of spiritual
[51:56] concentration and uh maybe to to take
[51:59] another portion out of that this
[52:00] morning. I want to talk to you on this
[52:02] the power of concentration. We were
[52:04] speaking there on the uh concentrated on
[52:06] the attraction Wednesday and tonight or
[52:08] this morning rather I want to speak on
[52:10] this uh the power of concentration and
[52:12] brother Bram says here in 1961 and the
[52:15] message Jesus Christ the same. He said,
[52:17] "Now he only comes to those who are
[52:20] looking for him." Oh, he says, "I'd like
[52:22] for that to go home." He says, "I hope
[52:24] that stands as high as the trees down
[52:27] here before you." He says, "You cannot
[52:30] look without seeing it." See, he only
[52:33] comes to those who are looking for him.
[52:35] Now, amen. That's a that's a very
[52:37] powerful thing this morning. He only
[52:39] comes to those who are looking for him.
[52:42] And brother Bam said, "And I want to
[52:43] raise this so high." Amen. that you'll
[52:46] be able to see. He only comes to those
[52:48] who are looking for him. Jesus said, "If
[52:50] I, amen, be lifted up from the earth. I
[52:53] will draw all men unto me." Now again,
[52:56] that word lifted means to lift up on
[52:58] high. It means to exalt. It means to
[53:01] raise to the very summit of magnificence
[53:03] and prosperity. Of course, that word
[53:06] draw means to draw. Amen. By an inward
[53:08] power. It means to lead, to impale.
[53:11] Brother Ram would call that there an
[53:13] insight. And he says, "Of course we all
[53:14] know what an end sign is." Amen. It's
[53:17] something that's in a commemoration.
[53:19] Amen. It's lifted up something to
[53:21] people. Amen. To look to see. It's
[53:24] something placed before you. And God
[53:27] promised Isaiah the 5th chapter in the
[53:30] 26th verse. Amen. That there would be an
[53:33] end sign lifted up. Now, amen. As we
[53:35] were speaking there Wednesday, how the
[53:37] prophet of God would say, "And what is
[53:38] the attraction on the mountain?" He
[53:40] says, "See, so I've got my mind." Amen.
[53:43] Set on this message. Amen. It's that
[53:45] third pull. It's the one I must be loyal
[53:48] and reverent to. Now, uh just to refresh
[53:51] your memories, the first pull was
[53:52] healing, right? Amen. The second pull
[53:54] was prophesying. But that third pull,
[53:57] amen, was the opening of the word, the
[53:59] opening of those seven seals, amen,
[54:01] which would reveal the hidden truths
[54:03] that was hidden in the word. Amen. And
[54:06] it would give the bride something to
[54:08] concentrate on. Now, amen. That word
[54:10] concentration is the action, amen, or
[54:13] the power of focusing one's attention,
[54:16] amen, or mental effort. It's to pay
[54:18] close attention. It's attentiveness,
[54:20] amen, its single-mindedness, its
[54:22] absorption, its engrossment, it is
[54:24] focusing or centering. Amen. The
[54:27] centralization direction, it is to deal
[54:30] with one particular thing above all
[54:32] others. Now, amen. As we were speaking
[54:34] there Wednesday on that spiritual
[54:36] concentration, it is the practice, amen,
[54:39] of intentionally focusing the mind,
[54:42] amen, on a sacred object, a meaning or
[54:44] experience, amen, in order to deepen
[54:47] awareness, clarity, amen, and cause
[54:50] inner transformation. At its core, it is
[54:53] gathering scattered attention, amen, and
[54:56] directing it steadily toward what is
[54:58] spiritually essential. Now, amen.
[55:00] Spiritual concentration involves
[55:02] different elements. The first one being,
[55:04] Amen, a focused attention. Amen. It
[55:07] means you would choose a single point of
[55:09] focus repeatedly. Amen. And return to it
[55:12] when the mind begins to wander. Amen. It
[55:15] is an inner stillness. Now, I want you
[55:17] to listen to this. Amen. As attention
[55:19] stabilizes, Amen. mental noise begins to
[55:22] quieten. Amen. Amen. Though thoughts may
[55:25] still arise, Amen. But when you are
[55:27] spiritually concentrated, Amen. Those
[55:30] thoughts may arise, but they quickly,
[55:33] amen, will lose their grip. NOW, YOU
[55:35] KNOW THE PROPHET OF GOD SAID, HE SAID,
[55:37] YOU SITTING there in that wheelchair,
[55:38] don't think that. AMEN. DO NOT THINK
[55:41] THAT YOU'RE HOPELESS AND HELPLESS. AMEN.
[55:43] You're not. Don't let that negative
[55:45] thought ever pass through. Don't let it
[55:48] anchor, Amen. You can't help it from
[55:50] going through your mind. Amen. Amen. How
[55:52] many can TESTIFY YOU CAN'T HELP
[55:54] THOUGHTS, AMEN, from going through your
[55:56] mind. He said, but don't let it stop.
[55:59] AMEN. IT'S LIKE THAT OLD FARMER SAID, "I
[56:01] CAN'T KEEP THE CROWS." AMEN. From flying
[56:04] OVER MY PLACE. BUT HE HAD A DOUBLE
[56:05] BARREL SHOTGUN. AMEN. And he could keep
[56:08] them from roosting. So you can't keep
[56:10] the negative thoughts from coming. Amen.
[56:12] But you can keep them from roosting. He
[56:14] said, "See, you've got a shotgun." Amen.
[56:18] It's both the New and the OLD TESTAMENT.
[56:20] IT'S A DOUBLE BARREL SHOTGUN. THAT AMEN.
[56:23] That other element there of spiritual
[56:25] concentration is a meaningful intention.
[56:27] It it is unlike ordinary concentration.
[56:30] Amen. It is it is towards wisdom and
[56:32] insight. Now, amen. The prophet of God
[56:35] said you become born again. He said you
[56:37] become a new creature in Christ. Old
[56:39] things have passed away. Amen. The
[56:41] carnal things of the world, amen, has no
[56:44] more hold on you. And you have no more
[56:47] hold on them. See, amen. WHEN YOU HAVE
[56:50] PASSED FROM death unto life, when God
[56:53] gets a hold of a man, amen, the first
[56:55] thing he does in the church, amen, is
[56:58] bring it from worldliness unto holiness.
[57:01] And he brings it from death unto life.
[57:03] See, it's born again. It's new. It's
[57:05] ideas are new. He says, "What we need is
[57:08] a revival like that today." Amen. Oh,
[57:11] we've had a dip of the spirit. We've had
[57:14] spiritual blessings and spiritual
[57:16] uprisings, but we don't need that no
[57:18] more. Amen. We need a revival of the
[57:22] spirit of the LIVING GOD IN THE hearts
[57:24] of the people. He said, "WE DON'T NEED
[57:26] SO MUCH OF the dips of the spirit or a
[57:28] spiritual awakening." Amen. We need a
[57:31] revival. AMEN. AMEN. LET'S REVIVE WHAT
[57:34] WE'VE GOT. AMEN. NOT A SPIRITUAL
[57:37] AWAKENING. NOW, I find it amazing. Amen.
[57:39] That he says just a few months later, he
[57:42] says the last plague that hit Egypt was
[57:44] death. And he said the last plague that
[57:46] hits the spiritual church, amen, is
[57:49] spiritual death. He said, "And what we
[57:51] need today, amen, is a spiritual
[57:54] awakening." Amen. Now, a few days ago,
[57:56] he said we don't need a spiritual
[57:57] awakening. Amen. But here he says we
[58:00] need a spiritual awakening. BUT WATCH
[58:02] WHAT HE HONES IT DOWN TO. AMEN. A
[58:04] SPIRITUAL AWAKENING TO DISCERNMENT.
[58:07] AMEN. AMEN. YOU'VE GOT TO DISCERN WHAT
[58:09] YOU'RE FOLLOWING. YOU YOU'VE GOT TO
[58:11] DISCERN WHAT spirit is leading you.
[58:13] LISTEN, I THINK IT'S time we quit
[58:15] letting feelings lead us AND AND LITTLE
[58:17] INSIGNIFICANT IDEAS lead us. I THINK
[58:19] IT'S TIME, AMEN, to come back to being
[58:21] mature sons and daughters of God. Amen.
[58:24] That have received the Holy Ghost and
[58:26] thereby can discern what is right and
[58:29] what is wrong. Amen. He said, see, amen.
[58:32] That transformative effect. Amen. As one
[58:34] begins to spiritually concentrate, it
[58:37] begins to cultivate and it begins to
[58:39] cause transformation. Now, Rebraham
[58:42] said, "It's so beautiful." He said,
[58:43] "Now, God has done everything." How many
[58:45] believes that?
[58:47] &gt;&gt; More than his duty was to do. He sent
[58:49] prophets and priests. He sent his son.
[58:52] He sent the Holy Spirit. He's done
[58:54] everything. And even took an oath by
[58:56] himself that he would perform these
[58:58] things. NOW, WHEN GOD gets rich and deep
[59:01] down here, SEE, MORE YOU GET OF GOD in
[59:03] here, Amen, the more you'll BELIEVE GOD.
[59:06] AND BECAUSE THERE'S more of him AND THE
[59:09] MORE YOU CULTIVATE this down here. Amen.
[59:12] The more you CAN BELIEVE GOD. IT'S JUST
[59:14] LIKE A CHILD WHEN HE'S A LITTLE BITTY
[59:16] FELLA, maybe he doesn't know very much.
[59:19] Amen. BUT AS HE GROWS OLDER, he begins
[59:22] to get knowing more of God. And that's
[59:24] when this spirit in here, amen, takes
[59:27] the nature of our heavenly father, who
[59:29] is God, amen, like I take the nature of
[59:32] my earthly father, amen, from my earthly
[59:34] parent. NOW, AMEN. AND I WANT YOU TO
[59:36] CATCH THIS BECAUSE IN 1965 in the Easter
[59:38] Seal, amen, the prophet of God says
[59:40] this. He says, "What a privilege it is,"
[59:43] Amen. to know that there is something in
[59:46] the resurrection that is pertaining to
[59:49] us. Amen. AMEN. WHAT A PRIVILEGE IT IS
[59:51] TO KNOW THAT THERE IS SOMETHING IN THE
[59:53] RESURRECTION, AMEN, that is pertaining
[59:56] to us. Now, amen. If you read Colossians
[59:59] chapter 3 and verse one from the
[1:00:00] Amplified Bible, it says, "Therefore,
[1:00:03] amen. If you have been raised with
[1:00:05] Christ, amen, to a new life, amen, you
[1:00:08] are sharing in his resurrection from the
[1:00:10] dead." Amen. Amen. There is something in
[1:00:13] the resurrection that is pertaining unto
[1:00:15] the bride. And if you have raised WITH
[1:00:18] CHRIST TO A NEW LIFE, AMEN. then you are
[1:00:21] sharing in his resurrection from the
[1:00:23] dead. You keep seeking the things that
[1:00:26] are above. Amen. Where Christ is seated
[1:00:28] at the right hand of God. NOW LISTEN.
[1:00:31] SET YOUR MIND. AMEN. AMEN. HELP ME NOW.
[1:00:34] SET YOUR MIND AND KEEP FOCUSED
[1:00:37] HABITUALLY on the things above. Amen.
[1:00:40] THE HEAVENLY THINGS. AMEN. NOT ON things
[1:00:43] that are on the earth which only have a
[1:00:46] temporal value. Amen. IF YOU HAVE BEEN
[1:00:48] DEAD IN SIN AND TRESPASSES AND HAVE BEEN
[1:00:51] MADE ALIVE BY CHRIST JESUS, YOU HAVE
[1:00:54] BEEN MADE A PART OF HIS RESURRECTION,
[1:00:57] AMEN, THEN YOU OUGHT TO CHANGE YOUR
[1:00:59] FOCUS. YOU OUGHT TO CHANGE WHAT YOU'RE
[1:01:01] CONCENTRATING ON. AND YOU OUGHT TO BEGIN
[1:01:03] TO FOCUS ON SOMETHING, AMEN, THAT DON'T
[1:01:06] HAVE TEMPORARY VALUE. AMEN. But it has
[1:01:08] eternal value. Now, amen. You all know
[1:01:11] THAT THERE IS A NATURAL mind and there
[1:01:14] is a spiritual MIND, RIGHT? AMEN. AND
[1:01:16] PAUL THERE IN COLOSSIANS 3, he is
[1:01:18] speaking, amen, of the spiritual mind.
[1:01:21] In Romans 8:6, he says, "For to be
[1:01:23] carnally minded is death,
[1:01:26] &gt;&gt; BUT TO BE SPIRITUALLY MINDED IS LIFE AND
[1:01:30] PEACE." NOW, BROTHER RAM IS SPEAKING IN
[1:01:32] 1953 of Cain in GENESIS 4. AND HE'S
[1:01:35] TALKING HOW THAT CAIN, AMEN, WAS
[1:01:37] CARNAL-MINDED, but Abel, Amen, was
[1:01:39] spiritual minded because Abel, amen,
[1:01:42] slew a lamb and he took the blood. AMEN.
[1:01:44] AND GOD LOOKED DOWN FROM HEAVEN AND HE
[1:01:46] ACTUALLY rewarded Abel. Y'all know that
[1:01:48] he REWARDED ABEL AND THE PROPHET OF GOD
[1:01:50] SAID, "WHAT WAS IT?" AMEN. SPIRITUALLY
[1:01:53] MINDED BY ELECTION. AMEN. KNOWING THAT
[1:01:56] THE earthly things doesn't please God,
[1:01:59] he offered life and blood. Now Paul GOES
[1:02:02] ON TO SAY IN 1 Corinthians 2:16, he
[1:02:04] says, "Who hath known, amen, the mind of
[1:02:07] the Lord that he may instruct him?" He
[1:02:10] says, "But we have, Amen, the mind OF
[1:02:14] CHRIST." AMEN. PAUL SAYS, "LET THIS MIND
[1:02:16] be in you WHICH WAS ALSO IN CHRIST
[1:02:20] JESUS." REVEREND SAID, "WHAT KIND OF
[1:02:22] MIND did he have?" Amen. Stay with the
[1:02:25] word. HE SAID, "THAT'S RIGHT. STAY WITH
[1:02:27] THE WORD." AMEN. THE FATHER'S WORD and
[1:02:30] defeated the enemy every time. Now, when
[1:02:33] the enemy attacks AND TRIES TO SAY, "YOU
[1:02:36] GOT TO DO THIS and you got to do that."
[1:02:38] Amen. SEE THAT ENEMY? HE'S TRYING TO
[1:02:40] DISTRACT YOU. HE'S TRYING TO scatter
[1:02:43] your attention. Amen. What are you GOING
[1:02:45] TO DO? YOU'RE GOING to stay with the
[1:02:47] word. AMEN. GOD SEPARATED HIMSELF AMONG
[1:02:50] US AND GIVEN HIS SPIRIT LIKE HE DID ON
[1:02:53] PENTECOST. AND IT WAS SEEN IN SYMBOLS OF
[1:02:56] FIRE. AMEN. FROM THE PILLAR. AMEN. THAT
[1:02:59] SEPARATED ITSELF AMONGST the people to
[1:03:01] GIVE HIS OWN LIFE OUT TO THE PEOPLE. AND
[1:03:04] THROUGH THIS, AMEN. THE MIND OF CHRIST
[1:03:07] SHOULD BE OPERATING AMONG US. AMEN.
[1:03:10] THROUGH HIS DEATH ON CALVARY AND THE
[1:03:13] SEPARATING OF HIMSELF in the upper room.
[1:03:16] AMEN. THE HOLY GHOST COMING INTO THE
[1:03:18] CHURCH. IT OUGHT TO BE DOING MORE THAN
[1:03:20] JUST MAKING US SHOUT. IT OUGHT TO BE
[1:03:22] DOING MORE THAN JUST MAKING US FEEL
[1:03:23] GOOD. AMEN. BUT IT OUGHT TO BE THE MIND
[1:03:26] OF CHRIST. AMEN. OPERATING IN every
[1:03:28] individual. HE SAID, SEE THEN THAT WORD
[1:03:31] OF GOD, AMEN. IT ALWAYS ATTRACTS, AMEN.
[1:03:34] THAT SPIRITUAL MIND. AMEN. WHY? BECAUSE
[1:03:37] IT'S THE MIND OF CHRIST in you. Amen.
[1:03:41] That knows the word is true.
[1:03:44] &gt;&gt; My Amen. THAT ONLY AMEN. THE SPIRITUAL
[1:03:48] MIND, AMEN. can see the promise of God
[1:03:51] and can see it coming to pass. When
[1:03:54] brother Ram speaks of the SPIRITUAL
[1:03:55] MIND, I LOVE HOW HE SPEAKS OF IT. HE'LL
[1:03:58] SAY, "YOU'RE PICKING SPIRITUAL things
[1:03:59] up." Amen. AMEN. OR HE'LL SAY, "OR THE
[1:04:02] SPIRITUAL MIND," AMEN. IS CATCHING THE
[1:04:05] MEANING BEHIND WHAT I'M SAYING. AMEN. HE
[1:04:07] SAYS, "OR GRASPING THE SPIRITUAL
[1:04:09] THINGS." NOW, AMEN. HE'S SPEAKING THERE
[1:04:11] IN 1963 of how that the storm was spoke
[1:04:14] out OF EXISTENCE IN COLORADO. AND HE
[1:04:16] SAID, "NOW, I COULDN'T TELL THIS." AMEN.
[1:04:19] Amongst people that's unbelievers. He
[1:04:21] said, "You only have to tell it to
[1:04:23] believers." And then because, amen, the
[1:04:26] unbelievers will never understand it.
[1:04:29] YOU GOT TO HAVE A SPIRITUAL MIND. AMEN.
[1:04:32] TO UNDERSTAND SPIRITUAL THINGS. AMEN.
[1:04:34] The word is spiritual. AMEN. AND IT'S
[1:04:37] INTERPRETED SPIRITUAL. THEN IF THIS IS A
[1:04:40] SPIRITUAL WORD, I SAY GOD GIVE US A
[1:04:43] SPIRITUAL MIND. AMEN. TO FOCUS ON THIS
[1:04:45] SPIRITUAL WORD UNTIL WE CAN BEGIN TO
[1:04:48] UNDER UNDERSTAND THINGS. AMEN. THAT
[1:04:51] DON'T HAVE TEMPORARY VALUE. AMEN. BUT
[1:04:53] THEY HAVE ETERNAL VALUE. LISTEN, I'LL
[1:04:55] TELL YOU THIS MORNING, YOUR LITTLE
[1:04:57] TROUBLE RIGHT NOW HAS TEMPORARY VALUE.
[1:04:59] AMEN. BUT THERE'S A SOUL ON THE INSIDE
[1:05:02] OF YOU THAT HAS ETERNAL VALUE. AMEN.
[1:05:05] THAT LITTLE ILL FEELING AND THAT LITTLE
[1:05:06] SPIRIT THAT YOU'RE TRYING TO CARRY
[1:05:08] AROUND. AMEN. THAT'S TRYING TO PULL YOU
[1:05:10] DOWN AND TRYING TO DISPLACE YOU AND TRY
[1:05:12] TO PARALYZE YOU. I WANT TO TELL YOU THIS
[1:05:15] MORNING, IT'S A TEMPORARY THING. BUT
[1:05:17] THERE'S A WORD CONCERNING THE CHURCH OF
[1:05:20] THE LIVING GOD. AND IF WE'LL TURN OUR
[1:05:22] EYES AND LOOK AWAY TO JESUS AND BEGIN TO
[1:05:24] FOCUS ON THAT, we will begin to
[1:05:26] understand what's really going on. Amen.
[1:05:29] And I think of how in John 6 when Jesus
[1:05:31] stood there AND HE SAID, "I AM THE BREAD
[1:05:33] OF HEAVEN." BROTHER, come [laughter]
[1:05:34] along. AND HE SAID, "NOW, HOW COULD HE
[1:05:36] BE BREAD and word, it would be puzzling
[1:05:39] TO THE CARNAL MINDS." AMEN. BUT WE ARE
[1:05:42] HOPING [laughter]
[1:05:43] THIS MORNING THAT THERE IS NO CARNAL
[1:05:45] MINDS AMONG US. OH, A GOD GRANTED HERE
[1:05:48] TODAY. AMEN. THERE IS NO CARNAL MINDS
[1:05:52] AMONG US. THAT THERE IS A SPIRITUAL MIND
[1:05:55] AMONG US THAT WE CAN UNDERSTAND. AMEN.
[1:05:58] WHAT THE FATHER IS TRYING TO GET TO US
[1:06:00] HERE. SEE, these words are puzzling, but
[1:06:04] at the same time, amen, THEY ARE
[1:06:06] SCRIPTURAL TRUTH. NOW, YOU ALL CAN AGREE
[1:06:09] WITH ME, AMEN, THAT A CARNAL MIND CANNOT

[1:06:19] AMEN, WHEN THE BLESSINGS OF GOD BEGIN TO
[1:06:21] FALL. AMEN. THE CARNAL MIND, AMEN, WILL
[1:06:24] SAY THEY SHOULDN'T BE DOING THIS AND AND
[1:06:26] THEY SHOULDN'T BE DOING THAT. AND WE

[1:06:29] TURN THIS UP. AMEN. IT'S A CARNAL MIND.
[1:06:31] AMEN. AND YOU KNOW WHAT A CARNAL MIND
[1:06:33] DOES? IT BEGINS TO CLAMP OFF. AMEN. THE
[1:06:36] FLOW OF THE SPIRIT OF GOD. AMEN. BUT I
[1:06:39] SAY LIKE A PROPHET SAID, "LORD, DON'T
[1:06:41] LET THERE BE A CARNAL MIND AMONG US."
[1:06:43] AMEN. LET THERE BE A SPIRITUAL MIND.

[1:07:08] GHOST AND OUR MIND BECOMES SPIRITUAL.
[1:07:11] HEY. AMEN. SATAN IS TRYING AMEN TO NUMB
[1:07:15] THE SPIRITUAL MIND. AMEN. SATAN IS

[1:07:23] TALK TO AN AUDIENCE LIKE THIS though
[1:07:25] feeling scolding sometimes in the
[1:07:27] spirit. It's only for correction THAT
[1:07:30] THE PEOPLE WOULD NOT BE SLOTHFUL. LORD,
[1:07:32] LET THEM KNOW THAT I love them and they
[1:07:35] know you love them. But Lord, they might
[1:07:37] be awakened out of this slump that the
[1:07:40] church is getting into. Their spiritual
[1:07:43] mind has be SEEN SO MANY THINGS UNTIL IT
[1:07:47] HAS BECOME NUMB. LIKE THE LITTLE BOY I
[1:07:50] spoke of, HE SAYS, "GOD, LET THE
[1:07:52] NUMBNESS leave tonight." AMEN. I THINK
[1:07:55] WE OUGHT TO PREACH HERE FOR A SECOND.
[1:07:57] AMEN. BECAUSE JUST BECAUSE, AMEN. WE'VE
[1:08:00] SEEN A LOT. DON'T MEAN GOD'S DONE DOING
[1:08:02] MORE. AMEN. AMEN. SOMEBODY SAY, "WELL,

[1:08:07] SOMETHING AND ALL OF A SUDDEN
[1:08:08] EVERYTHING'S WRONG AND this is wrong

[1:08:33] numb to the spirit. Amen. Don't be numb
[1:08:35] to spiritual things. WE ARE IN THE
[1:08:38] GREATEST BATTLE THAT HAS EVER BEEN
[1:08:39] FOUGHT. AMEN. IT'S THE BATTLE OF THE
[1:08:42] HUMAN MIND. AND THE BATTLEGROUNDS THAT
[1:08:44] WAS CHOSEN BY GOD, AMEN, IS THE HUMAN
[1:08:47] MIND. AMEN. NOW, WATCH WHAT A PROPHET

[1:08:55] OF EDEN, AMEN. NOW, SATAN STARTED THIS
[1:08:58] BATTLE ALL THE WAY back [clears throat]
[1:09:02] &gt;&gt; in the Garden of Eden. Reb said, "See,
[1:09:05] because decisions are made IN THE MIND,
[1:09:08] THE HEAD, [laughter]
[1:09:10] there is where Satan meets you." UH,
[1:09:12] COME ON. LET'S PREACH A SECOND. IT'S IN
[1:09:14] THE MIND. It's in the head. THAT'S WHERE
[1:09:17] THE DEVIL MEETS YOU. HE DON'T MEET YOU
[1:09:19] ON THE PARKING LOT. HE DON'T MEET YOU ON
[1:09:21] THE PEW. HE DON'T MEET YOU IN THE FOYER.
[1:09:23] AMEN. He meets you first in your mind
[1:09:26] AND THEN PLANTS THAT IDEA IN YOUR MIND
[1:09:28] AND YOU EITHER REJECT IT OR YOU ACCEPT
[1:09:31] IT. AND THAT DETERMINES ON WHAT LEVEL
[1:09:33] YOU'RE GOING TO LIVE IN. COME ON,
[1:09:34] CHURCH. AMEN. I'VE SEEN PEOPLE GET STUFF
[1:09:36] IN THEIR MIND AND IT BECOMES SO REAL to
[1:09:38] them and it ain't nothing but an OLD
[1:09:40] DEVIL. AMEN. TRYING TO CONFUSE THEM.
[1:09:43] AMEN. WELL, DON'T NOBODY LIKE ME. AMEN.
[1:09:45] I'M JUST GOING TO PREACH A SECOND. AMEN.
[1:09:47] DON'T NOBODY DOWN THE CHURCH HOUSE LIKE
[1:09:48] ME. AMEN. WELL, I WANT TO SAY THIS UNTIL

[1:09:53] PERSON, AMEN. TO THE INFANT IF THEY LIKE
[1:09:56] YOU. YOU ARE LYING ON THE CHURCH. AMEN.
[1:09:58] AMEN. THAT'S JUST THE DEVIL TRYING TO
[1:10:00] TELL YOU THAT. I'VE SEEN PEOPLE SAY,
[1:10:02] "WELL, AMEN. I DON'T FIT IN AND I DON'T
[1:10:04] INCLUDE." AMEN. I TELL YOU WHAT IT IS.
[1:10:05] IT'S A DEVIL. AMEN. BUT IF YOU'LL COME
[1:10:07] BACK TO THE OLD LANDMARK, WHY ARE WE
[1:10:10] HERE ANYHOW? THIS AIN'T A SOCIAL CLUB.
[1:10:12] THIS AIN'T A BOYS CLUB. IT'S A HOUSE OF
[1:10:15] GOD. WE'RE NOT HERE TO SEE WHO'S WHO AND
[1:10:17] WHO DONE WHAT. WE'RE HERE TO WORSHIP GOD
[1:10:20] AND FOCUS ON THE THINGS THAT GOD HAS
[1:10:23] DONE IN OUR GENERATION. HEY, I think
[1:10:25] it's TIME TO TAKE THE HELMET OF
[1:10:26] SALVATION AND THE SWORD OF THE SPIRIT,
[1:10:29] WHICH IS THE WORD OF GOD, AND WAGE WAR
[1:10:31] AGAINST THAT DEVIL THAT'S TRYING TO
[1:10:33] PARALYZE YOU IN YOUR IN YOUR MIND.
[1:10:37] AMEN. I know what I'm TALKING ABOUT.
[1:10:39] AMEN. WE all fight mind battles. AMEN.
[1:10:41] WHEREFORE, PETER SAYS, "WHEREFORE, GIRD
[1:10:44] up the loins of your mind." Amen. Be
[1:10:46] sober and hope to the end for the GRACE
[1:10:49] THAT IS TO be brought unto you at the
[1:10:52] revelation of Jesus Christ. AMEN. NOW,
[1:10:54] WHEN YOU STUDY THERE IN THE HEBREW, that
[1:10:56] word loins, amen, was what the Hebrews
[1:10:59] thought, amen, the generative or
[1:11:01] reproduction, AMEN, POWER RESIDED. NOW I
[1:11:04] WANT YOU TO LOOK HERE IN ACTS CHAPTER 2.
[1:11:06] BROTHER Bam reads it from the EMPHATIC
[1:11:08] DIALOGUE AND HE SAYS IN THE IN THE TO BE
[1:11:11] FULLY and in the to be fully come the
[1:11:15] day of Pentecost. Now listen what he
[1:11:17] says and we're all with one mind in the
[1:11:20] same. HE SAYS NOW I LIKE THAT BETTER
[1:11:22] THAN ONE ACCORD. AMEN. CUZ YOU could be
[1:11:25] in one accord UP ON MOST ANY SUBJECT.
[1:11:28] YOU COULD BE IN ONE ACCORD UP ON MOST
[1:11:31] ANY SUBJECT, BUT HERE THEIR MIND WAS THE
[1:11:34] SAME. AMEN. SO, IT WAS NOT JUST THEY
[1:11:37] WERE ALL AGREEING on one little point.
[1:11:39] AMEN. BUT THEY ALL HAD THE SAME MIND AND
[1:11:42] WAS in the same place. Amen. NOW, DO YOU
[1:11:45] SEE WHY SATAN, AMEN, ATTACKS THE MIND?
[1:11:48] BECAUSE HE KNOWS WHAT HAPPENED BEFORE.
[1:11:51] AMEN. THE PROPHET OF GOD SAID, "IF THIS
[1:11:53] CHURCH RIGHT NOW COULD BE PUT TOGETHER
[1:11:56] and knitted together with such that
[1:11:58] every person would be in one ACCORD WITH
[1:12:01] NOT ONE SHADOW OF DOUBT ANYWHERE, THERE
[1:12:03] WOULD NOT BE A FEEBLE PERSON IN OUR
[1:12:05] MIDST IN ANOTHER FIVE MINUTES. THERE
[1:12:08] WOULD NOT BE NOBODY HERE DESIRING THE
[1:12:10] HOLY GHOST BUT WOULD RECEIVE IT IF YOU
[1:12:13] COULD JUST GET THAT CERTAIN THING
[1:12:15] FIXED." AMEN. NOW, THERE'S where the
[1:12:18] battle begins. Amen. RIGHT IN YOUR MIND.
[1:12:20] NOW WATCH A PROPHET. HE SAYS THIS IS NOT
[1:12:23] CHRISTIAN SCIENCE. THIS IS NOT MIND OVER
[1:12:26] MATTER. He says the mind accepts the
[1:12:28] life which IS THE WORD OF GOD AND there
[1:12:31] brings a life. HE SAID NOW JUST YOUR
[1:12:33] THOUGHT DOESN'T DO IT. BUT THE WORD OF
[1:12:36] GOD BROUGHT in the channel of your
[1:12:38] thought. SEE IT'S NOT THE THOUGHT AS
[1:12:41] CHRISTIAN SCIENCE makes it. Amen. Mind
[1:12:43] over matter. NO, THAT ISN'T IT. But your
[1:12:46] mind, are you WITH ME? YOUR MIND ACCEPTS
[1:12:49] IT. IT GRASPED IT. WHAT IS YOUR MIND
[1:12:51] CONTROLLED BY? Your spirit. And your
[1:12:54] spirit catches THE WORD OF GOD. AND
[1:12:56] THAT'S THE THING THAT'S GOT LIFE IN IT.
[1:13:00] [snorts]
[1:13:00] &gt;&gt; It brings life into you. Oh brother,
[1:13:03] WHEN THAT TAKES PLACE, WHEN LIFE COMES
[1:13:05] DOWN THAT CHANNEL into you, he says,
[1:13:08] "The word of God is manifested in you.
[1:13:11] IF HE ABIDE IN ME AND MY WORDS ABIDE in
[1:13:14] you, Amen. Then ask what you will and it
[1:13:18] will be done for you. AMEN. SEE, IT MUST
[1:13:21] BE accepted in the mind and then it's
[1:13:24] believed with a heart. AMEN. DO YOU SEE
[1:13:27] HOW POWERFUL THE MIND IS? WHAT YOUR MIND
[1:13:29] ACCEPTS BECOMES WHAT YOU BELIEVE. IF
[1:13:32] YOUR MIND ACCEPTS YOU'RE NO GOOD, THEN
[1:13:34] YOU'RE GOING TO BELIEVE YOU'RE no good.
[1:13:36] IF YOUR MIND ACCEPTS THAT YOU'RE A
[1:13:38] FAILURE, THEN YOU'RE GOING TO BELIEVE
[1:13:40] YOU'RE A FAILURE. IF YOUR MIND ACCEPTS
[1:13:42] THAT YOU'RE AN OUTCAST, THEN YOU'RE
[1:13:43] GOING TO BEGIN TO BELIEVE YOU'RE AN
[1:13:45] OUTCAST. BUT IF YOU CAN BEGIN TO ACCEPT,
[1:13:48] AMEN, THE AUTHORITATIVE PROMISES OF
[1:13:50] ALMIGHTY GOD, YOU WILL BEGIN TO BELIEVE
[1:13:53] THEM AND YOU WILL BEGIN TO MANIFEST THEM
[1:13:55] AND THEN THE WORD OF GOD BECOMES A
[1:13:57] REALITY. THEN EVERY SENSE OF THE SOUL
[1:14:00] AND BODY IS JUST SCOURED OUT WITH THE
[1:14:04] HOLY GHOST. OH, THERE'S NOTHING CAN COME
[1:14:06] UP IN THE MEMORY AND SAY, "WELL, I
[1:14:08] REMEMBER MISS JONES TRIED TO TRUST GOD
[1:14:10] and Miss Doe AND SHE TRIED TO TRUST GOD
[1:14:12] FOR HEALING ONE TIME AND she failed."
[1:14:15] SEE, IF THAT CHANNEL HAS BEEN CLEARED
[1:14:18] OUT AND HAS BEEN PURGED AND HAS BEEN
[1:14:20] FILLED ON THE INSIDE WHERE THE HOLY
[1:14:23] SPIRIT THAT DON'T EVEN COME IN MEMORY,
[1:14:26] NO MATTER HOW NO MATTER ABOUT MISS JONES
[1:14:28] AND WHAT SHE DID, it's you AND GOD
[1:14:31] TOGETHER AND NOBODY ELSE BUT YOU TWO.
[1:14:34] AMEN. There you are. AMEN. SEE, THEN THE
[1:14:38] MIND, AMEN, IS THE GATE TO THE SOUL,
[1:14:40] RIGHT? AMEN. THE GATE to the spirit
[1:14:43] rather. HE SAYS YOUR MIND OPENS UP
[1:14:47] &gt;&gt; AND ACCEPTS THE SPIRIT OR IT REJECTS THE
[1:14:50] SPIRIT. HE SAID NOW SEE IT'S YOUR MIND
[1:14:53] amen that opens up the DOOR OR IT CLOSES
[1:14:56] THE DOOR AND THEN AND LISTENS to your
[1:14:59] conscience or listens to your memory OR
[1:15:01] LISTENS TO YOUR AFFECTIONS. BUT WHEN
[1:15:03] YOUR MIND CLOSES ITSELF TO THESE THINGS
[1:15:06] AND LET GOD, AMEN. THE SPIRIT OF his
[1:15:09] word come in, IT BLOWS THE REST OF THE
[1:15:12] STUFF OUT. LISTEN. LISTEN. If you let
[1:15:15] the word COME IN INTO THAT MIND, EVERY
[1:15:18] DOUBT IS GONE. EVERY FEAR IS GONE. EVERY
[1:15:22] SENSATION OF DOUBT IS GONE. COME ON. I'M
[1:15:24] TALKING ABOUT A POWERFUL BOMB. I'M
[1:15:26] TALKING ABOUT GOD'S ATOMIC BOMB. AND
[1:15:28] BROTHER SAID, "WHAT IS GOD'S ATOMIC
[1:15:30] BOMB?" IT IS FAITH IN HIS WORD. IF YOU
[1:15:33] WOULD ALLOW GOD, AMEN, THIS MORNING TO
[1:15:35] DROP A BOMB ON THEM OLD DEVILS THAT'S
[1:15:38] TRYING TO LIVE RENTREE IN YOUR MIND AND
[1:15:40] CONVINCE YOU OF THINGS THAT'S REALLY NOT
[1:15:42] TRUE IF YOU'LL LET THE HOLY GHOST BLOW
[1:15:45] THEM THINGS OUT. EVERY DOUBT WILL BE
[1:15:47] GONE. EVERY FEAR WILL BE GONE. COME ON.
[1:15:49] BROTHER RAM SAID THERE WON'T EVEN BE A
[1:15:51] SENSATION OF DOUBT LEFT.
[1:15:54] &gt;&gt; MY GOODNESS. EVERY FEELING IS GONE.
[1:15:57] WELL, WE MIGHT AS WELL HAVE CHURCH. IT'S
[1:15:59] COLD OUTSIDE AND YOU DROVE OVER HERE.
[1:16:01] AMEN. HOW MANY SAY, "LORD, CLEAR OUT MY
[1:16:03] MIND. LET THE HOLY GHOST COME IN. LET
[1:16:06] THE HOLY GHOST DRIVE OUT EVERYTHING
[1:16:08] THAT'S UNLIKE THIS WORD. I'M NOT HERE TO
[1:16:10] BELIEVE IDEAS. I'M NOT HERE TO BELIEVE
[1:16:13] FEELINGS. I'M NOT HERE TO BELIEVE
[1:16:14] SENSATIONS. I AM HERE AS A SON OF GOD TO
[1:16:18] BELIEVE the word of God." Yes, sir. He
[1:16:21] said, "EVERY FEELING IS GONE. THEN
[1:16:23] there's nothing standing but the word of
[1:16:26] God."
[1:16:27] Are y'all ready for this?
[1:16:29] &gt;&gt; AND SATAN CANNOT BATTLE AGAINST THAT.
[1:16:34] &gt;&gt; My goodness. No sir. I I TELL YOU, I
[1:16:37] DON'T KNOW HOW MANY TIMES THAT OLD
[1:16:38] DEVIL'S COME AGAINST me in my mind AND
[1:16:41] TOLD ME THIS ABOUT ME AND THIS ABOUT ME
[1:16:42] AND YOU DON'T LIKE IT AND THIS AND ALL
[1:16:44] THEM. COME ON. WE ALL BATTLE IT. AMEN.
[1:16:47] BUT SOMEWHERE OR ANOTHER, YOU GOT TO LET
[1:16:48] THE WORD take control.
[1:16:51] &gt;&gt; Now listen, we got to get our mind set.
[1:16:55] WE GOT TO GET IT SPIRITUALLY
[1:16:57] CONCENTRATED. WE WE WE GOT TO GET
[1:16:59] FOCUSED. NOW, NOW FRIENDS, I'M PREACHING
[1:17:01] TO YOU. WE GOT TO GET FOCUSED BECAUSE
[1:17:04] THERE'S A POWER IN SPIRITUAL
[1:17:06] CONCENTRATION. DO YOU REALIZE AS LONG AS
[1:17:08] YOU'RE SAYING, "WELL, ONE DAY I'M IN,
[1:17:10] NEXT DAY I'm out. One day I'm up, next
[1:17:11] day I'm down. One day they're with me,
[1:17:12] NEXT DAY THEY'RE AGAIN." AS LONG AS
[1:17:14] YOU'RE LIVING LIKE THAT, AMEN, YOU'RE
[1:17:16] LIVING WITH A SCATTERED MIND. BUT IF YOU
[1:17:18] CAN EVER LET THE HOLY GHOST EVER FOCUS
[1:17:21] YOUR ATTENTION ON THE THINGS THAT ARE
[1:17:23] ABOVE, HE WILL ACTUALLY CAUSE YOU TO
[1:17:26] BECOME A CHRISTIAN. AMEN. NOW LISTEN,
[1:17:28] YOU WON'T BECOME A POSITIVE THINKER BY
[1:17:30] SOME 10STEP PSYCHOLOGY BOOK. BUT YOU
[1:17:32] WILL BECOME A POSITIVE BELIEVER, AMEN,
[1:17:35] BY THE CONTROL OF THE HOLY GHOST ON THE
[1:17:38] INSIDE OF YOUR SOUL. NOW YOU SAY, IS
[1:17:40] THERE REALLY A POWER IN CONCENTRATION?
[1:17:42] BROTHER SAYS HERE IN A DISCERNMENT, HE
[1:17:44] SAID, NOW HERE'S ANOTHER LADY. I DON'T
[1:17:46] KNOW HER, BUT SHE'S A CHRISTIAN AND SHE
[1:17:49] HAS FAITH. SHE'S A BELIEVER. AND GOD can
[1:17:52] reveal to me what's WRONG WITH THE
[1:17:54] WOMAN. IF HE CAN REVEAL what's wrong
[1:17:57] with this woman, he could reveal what's
[1:17:59] wrong with that woman or that person or
[1:18:02] this one here or that one up there or
[1:18:05] over here, wherever. Is that right? NOW
[1:18:07] LISTEN. IT'S WHEREVER YOU SET YOUR MIND
[1:18:10] AND WATCH IT WOULD TAKE PLACE. IT'S
[1:18:13] WHEREVER YOU SET YOUR MIND AND BEGIN TO
[1:18:16] WATCH IS WHERE THE POWER OF GOD WILL
[1:18:19] TAKE PLACE. DO YOU BELIEVE THAT? HE
[1:18:21] SAID, "THEN HAVE FAITH." AMEN. LOOK HERE
[1:18:24] IN PERSEVERANCE 62. HE SAYS, "NOW
[1:18:26] perseverance to be persistent." AMEN. TO
[1:18:29] TRY TO MAKE A GOAL. HE SAID, "YOU'VE GOT
[1:18:31] YOUR MIND SET ON SOMETHING AND YOU'RE
[1:18:35] PERSISTENT IN IT BECAUSE you believe
[1:18:37] IT'S THE THING YOU WANT." LISTEN, YOU
[1:18:40] DON'T JUST BELIEVE you want it. He says,
[1:18:42] "AND YOU BELIEVE YOU CAN GET IT." AMEN.
[1:18:44] LISTEN, I DON'T JUST BELIEVE I WANT A
[1:18:46] RAPTURE. I BELIEVE I CAN GET A RAPTURE.
[1:18:48] AMEN. I JUST DON'T BELIEVE I WANT A
[1:18:50] VICTORY. I BELIEVE I CAN GET THE
[1:18:52] VICTORY. I DON'T JUST BELIEVE I WANT A
[1:18:54] REVIVAL. I BELIEVE I CAN HAVE A REVIVAL
[1:18:57] BECAUSE THE GOD I'M SERVING IS THE GOD
[1:18:59] THAT SAID, "WHATSOEVER THINGS YOU DESIRE
[1:19:02] WHEN YOU PRAY, BELIEVE THAT YOU RECEIVE
[1:19:04] THEM AND YOU SHALL HAVE THEM." YES, SIR.
[1:19:07] AMEN. TO BE PERSISTENT. LISTEN, YOU'VE
[1:19:10] GOT YOUR MIND MADE UP ON WHAT YOU'RE
[1:19:13] GOING TO DO NOW. YOU CANNOT HAVE FAITH
[1:19:15] IN GOD WITHOUT KNOWING THE WORD OF GOD
[1:19:18] OR KNOWING SOMETHING ABOUT GOD.
[1:19:22] &gt;&gt; In the spirit of TRUTH 63, HE SAID, "YOU
[1:19:24] SEE DIFFERENT THINGS." LISTEN, LISTEN.
[1:19:27] YOU SEE THINGS DIFFERENT RATHER WHEN YOU
[1:19:29] GO TO FOCUSING. AMEN. YOU SEE THINGS
[1:19:32] DIFFERENT WHEN YOU GO TO FOCUSING AND
[1:19:34] USE GOD'S WORD FOR A FOCUS ON HIM AND
[1:19:38] YOU WILL SEE WHAT I'M TALKING ABOUT. HE
[1:19:41] SAYS, "SEE, BUT YOU GOT TO GET IT IN
[1:19:43] FOCUS FIRST." AMEN. SO, the first thing
[1:19:45] you GOT TO DO IS YOU GOT TO GET IN FOCUS
[1:19:48] WHAT YOU'RE TRYING TO ACHIEVE. AMEN.
[1:19:51] NOW, IN 1965, BROTHER BEN PREACHES THAT
[1:19:53] POWERFUL SERMON AND HE CALLS IT WHAT IS

[1:20:00] OVER THERE IN MATTHEW 21 AND HE'S
[1:20:02] TALKING ABOUT JESUS. REMEMBER AS HE COME
[1:20:05] RIDING INTO JERUSALEM AND BRAM SAYS,
[1:20:07] "NOW LISTEN." HE SAID, "NOW THERE WAS
[1:20:09] PEOPLE GATHERED THERE, AMEN, to see WHAT
[1:20:12] WAS GOING TO HAPPEN." HE SAID, "NOW WHAT
[1:20:14] DREW THEM BELIEVERS, AMEN, to Jerusalem
[1:20:18] AT THAT SPECIFIC TIME?" NOW, COME ON,
[1:20:20] SAINTS. AMEN, BROTHER DAVID. THEY DIDN'T
[1:20:22] HAVE NEWSPAPERS. THEY DIDN'T HAVE
[1:20:24] PHONES. THEY THEY DIDN'T HAVE LITTLE
[1:20:25] LITTLE UH CHAT GROUPS TO ADVERTISE JESUS
[1:20:28] WAS COMING. He says, "WHAT DO THAT? WHAT
[1:20:30] DREW him there?" HE SAID, "MANY PEOPLE
[1:20:33] BEING SPIRITUALLY MINDED." [laughter]
[1:20:35] AMEN. They knew HE WAS THE PASSOVER
[1:20:38] LAMB. AND BECAUSE HE HAD ALREADY TOLD
[1:20:40] THEM, AMEN, THE THINGS THAT WAS GOING TO
[1:20:43] HAPPEN. SO THERE WAS ONE GROUP THAT WAS
[1:20:46] SPIRITUALLY MINDED BY ELECTION AND they
[1:20:48] were watching FOR HIM. BUT THERE WAS
[1:20:50] ANOTHER GROUP THAT WAS CARNALLY MINDED
[1:20:53] AND THEY WAS WONDERING WHAT IS THE
[1:20:55] ATTRACTION. AMEN. I'm going to preach
[1:20:57] this morning. AMEN. BECAUSE THE PRO SAID
[1:20:59] YOU COULD FEEL, AMEN. THE PRESSURE IN
[1:21:02] THE ATMOSPHERE. He said God is watching

[1:21:10] MAKE IT ACT. THAT'S WHY YOU PEOPLE ARE
[1:21:12] HUNGERING FOR A REVIVAL. IT'S TIME FOR
[1:21:16] THESE THINGS TO BE HERE. COME ON. THE
[1:21:18] REASON YOU FEEL THE PULL, THE REASON YOU

[1:21:23] GOD'S CALENDAR, IT IS THE TIME FOR THERE
[1:21:26] TO BE A PEOPLE ON FIRE WITH THE HOLY
[1:21:29] GHOST AND LIVING SO CLOSE TO GOD UNTIL
[1:21:32] THE DEVIL DON'T KNOW WHAT TO DO WITH
[1:21:33] THEM. YES, SIR. WE GOT SO MANY TIES.

[1:21:47] PLACE, AMEN, to move himself into that
[1:21:51] he can work, AMEN, WORD BY WORD. HEY, I
[1:21:54] DON'T KNOW ABOUT YOU, I SAY, LORD, LET
[1:21:56] IT BE ME. LET ME BE the place that you
[1:21:59] can move into and can begin to work your
[1:22:02] word, word by word.
[1:22:05] &gt;&gt; You love him this morning. In Matthew
[1:22:07] 21, those spiritual-minded believers,
[1:22:10] they had hearts that he could work in.
[1:22:13] Rebraham said, "AFTER ALL THIS NERVOUS
[1:22:15] ANTICIPATION, the church is asleep. The
[1:22:18] people's nerves was on edge, AND THERE
[1:22:20] WERE SO MANY PEOPLE THERE. AND THEN IT
[1:22:22] HAPPENED." AMEN. ON TOP OF MOUNT OLIVES
[1:22:25] COME A LITTLE WHITE DONKEY DOWN THE HILL
[1:22:27] AND PEOPLE FANATICALLY SCREAMING. They
[1:22:29] were pulling PALMS AND LEAVES OFF THE
[1:22:31] TREES. THEY WERE THROWING THEIR CLOTHES
[1:22:33] in the road. THEY WERE SCREAMING,
[1:22:35] "HOSANA!" AMEN. TO THE SON OF DAVID THAT
[1:22:38] COMES IN THE NAME OF THE LORD. THIS
[1:22:39] LITTLE MULE, HIS RIDER WAS NONE
[1:22:42] [laughter] WAS NONE OTHER THAN GOD'S
[1:22:44] ANOINTED MESSIAH OF THE HOUR. HE SAID
[1:22:47] GOD then what was he doing? WHAT IS THAT
[1:22:51] ATTRACTION UP THERE ON THE HEEL? IT'S
[1:22:53] GOD MAKING HISTORY AND GOD FULFILLING
[1:22:56] PROPHECY. AND THAT ALWAYS CAUSES AN
[1:22:59] ATTRACTION. IT BRINGS ALL THE CRITICS
[1:23:01] UP, THE VULTURES UP AND THE EAGLES ALSO.
[1:23:05] WHENEVER THERE'S AN ATTRACTION, IT'LL
[1:23:07] BRING THE CRITICS. IT'LL BRING THE
[1:23:09] VULTURES. BUT, BROTHER BRIAN, IT'LL ALSO
[1:23:11] BRING SOME EAGLES. AND I DON'T KNOW
[1:23:12] ABOUT YOU THIS MORNING, GOD, I DON'T
[1:23:14] WANT TO BE A CRITIC. I DON'T WANT TO BE
[1:23:16] A VULTURE. I WANT TO BE AN EAGLE THAT IS
[1:23:19] ATTRACTED TO THE CARCASS OF YOUR WORD.
[1:23:23] &gt;&gt; SOME COMING FOR CURIOSITY, SOME COMING
[1:23:25] TO FIND FAULT, OTHERS COMING TO
[1:23:27] CRITICIZE. AMEN. THERE'S ALL KINDS
[1:23:29] GATHERED. AMEN. WHAT'S ON THE MOUNTAIN
[1:23:32] IS PROPHECY BEING FULFILLED. NOW LISTEN,
[1:23:34] THIS IS ZECHARIAH 9. AMEN. THE SPIRIT OF
[1:23:37] PROPHECY PROPHESIED AT THIS HAPPENING IN
[1:23:40] ZECHARIAH 9. AMEN. REJOICE GREATLY, OH
[1:23:43] DAUGHTER OF ZION. AMEN. SHOUT, oh
[1:23:46] daughter OF JERUSALEM. BEHOLD, THY KING
[1:23:48] cometh unto thee. HE IS JUST AND HAVING
[1:23:52] SALVATION. He is lowly and RIDING UPON
[1:23:55] AN ASS AND UPON THE COLT. AMEN. THE FOE
[1:23:58] OF AN ASS. REMEMBER SAID, "NOW THIS WAS
[1:24:00] 487
[1:24:02] years BEFORE IT HAPPENED." COME ON,
[1:24:04] CHURCH. THEY HAD BEEN LOOKING AT
[1:24:06] ISAIAH'S OR ZACHCHARIAH'S PROPHECY FOR
[1:24:09] 487
[1:24:11] YEARS. THEY HAD BEEN FOCUSING ON WHAT
[1:24:13] ZECHARIAH SAID, "I'M PREACHING TO YOU."
[1:24:16] HOW MANY TIMES HAD THEY READ ZECHARIAH
[1:24:18] 9, BROTHER DAVID? HOW MANY TIMES HAD
[1:24:21] THEY BEGIN TO HONE IN ON IT? AND THEY
[1:24:23] BEGIN TO FOCUS ON IT BECAUSE THEY KNEW
[1:24:25] WHEN THIS SCRIPTURE BECOMES MANIFESTED,
[1:24:28] IT IS THE COMING OF SALVATION UNTO THE
[1:24:31] EARTH. OH, WHY COULDN'T THEY SEE THAT
[1:24:33] PROPHECY BEING FULFILLED? THE SAME
[1:24:35] REASON they can't SEE IT TODAY. THEY HAD
[1:24:38] TOOK THE WORD OF GOD AND MADE IT A NONE
[1:24:40] EFFECT TO THE PEOPLE BY TEACHING for
[1:24:42] traditions. AMEN. THE DOCTRINES OF THE
[1:24:45] TRADITION OF MAN. REVEREND SAID, "SEE,
[1:24:47] HISTORY WAS BEING MADE." BROTHER BRIAN,
[1:24:50] PROPHECY WAS BEING FULFILLED. COME ON
[1:24:52] CHURCH. SALVATION TO THE WORLD WAS
[1:24:56] ARRIVING. THE GREAT DAY THAT ALL THE
[1:24:58] PROPHETS HAD LOOKED FORWARD TO. ALL THAT
[1:25:00] WAS IN the grave WAS WAITING FOR THAT
[1:25:02] DAY. ALL THAT HAD DIED. ALL THE
[1:25:05] RIGHTEOUS OF THE BLOOD OF THE MARTYRS
[1:25:06] AND THE PROPHETS. YOU KNOW WHAT A
[1:25:07] PROPHET SAID? HE SAID EVERY PATRIARCH
[1:25:10] THAT WAS IN THE grave was waiting FOR
[1:25:12] THIS HOUR. AND THE CHURCH WAS BLIND TO
[1:25:15] IT. HE SAID THE CHURCH WAS BLIND TO IT.
[1:25:18] AND HERE'S WHAT THEY WERE SAYING. WHO IS
[1:25:21] THIS CAUSING ALL THAT NOISE? WELL, WE
[1:25:23] MIGHT AS WELL PREACH. WHO IS THAT FELLA?
[1:25:26] IS THAT NOT THAT CARPENTER'S SON OVER
[1:25:28] HERE? WHERE DID HE GET THIS WISDOM? RE
[1:25:30] SAID, "OH MY, HE WAS THE ANSWER TO THE
[1:25:33] PROPHET'S PROPHECY." THEY WERE
[1:25:35] QUESTIONING THE ANSWER. OH, CHURCH OF
[1:25:38] THE LIVING GOD. THAT HAPPENING WAS GOING
[1:25:40] ON AND THEY WERE BLINDED TO IT.
[1:25:44] &gt;&gt; THEIR SPIRITUAL MIND HAD BECOME NUMB.
[1:25:47] THE NUMBNESS HAD SET IN. THEIR MIND HAD
[1:25:50] SCATTERED. THEIR THOUGHTS HAD WONDERED.
[1:25:52] THEY HAD LOST THE ATTENTION. OH, BUT
[1:25:54] THERE WAS SOME, HALLELUJAH. THERE WAS
[1:25:57] SOME THERE THAT SAID, "NO MATTER WHO
[1:25:59] GOES, NO MATTER WHO COMES, NO MATTER
[1:26:01] WHAT YOU DO, I KNOW THAT THIS IS THE
[1:26:04] ANSWER TO THE PROPHET'S PROPHECY. I KNOW
[1:26:06] THIS IS MY REVIVAL. I KNOW THIS IS WHAT
[1:26:09] I'VE BEEN looking for." Hallelujah. What
[1:26:12] was it, brother? It was the happening.
[1:26:14] AMEN. IT WAS A HAPPENING. AMEN. CAN I
[1:26:16] SAY IT TO YOU THIS MORNING? IT'S A
[1:26:18] HAPPENING. SHAKE YOURSELF. AMEN. THIS
[1:26:21] DIDN'T JUST COME UP IN MATTHEW 21.
[1:26:23] BROTHER TOM, YOU COULD GO ALL THE WAY
[1:26:25] BACK TO GENESIS 3. AND FOR THE FIRST
[1:26:28] TIME, you could read IN GENESIS 3 WHAT
[1:26:31] WAS GOING TO HAPPEN IN MATTHEW 21.
[1:26:34] &gt;&gt; OH, I will put enmity between thee and
[1:26:36] the woman,
[1:26:37] &gt;&gt; and between thy seed and her seed. It
[1:26:40] shall bruise thy head, AND THOU SHALT
[1:26:44] BRUISE HIS HEEL.
[1:26:47] 4,000 YEARS. Are y'all with me?
[1:26:51] &gt;&gt; BETWEEN GENESIS 3 AND MATTHEW 21,
[1:26:55] PROPHECY HAD BEEN TRAVELING THROUGH THE
[1:26:58] BIBLE. PROPHECY HAD COME THROUGH THE
[1:27:01] BIBLE. AND GOD MAKES IT SO CLEAR AND
[1:27:04] PLAIN, BROTHER ED, THAT THE ONLY WAY TO
[1:27:07] MISS IT IS TO BE SPIRITUALLY BLINDED.
[1:27:09] BLIND RELIGIOUS LEADERS AND TEACHERS OF
[1:27:11] THAT DAY, LISTEN, HAD BLINDED THE PEOPLE
[1:27:15] TO IT. LOOK WHAT PAUL SAYS IN GALATIANS
[1:27:17] 1:8. He says, "Though we or an angel
[1:27:20] from heaven." That's right.
[1:27:22] &gt;&gt; Preach any other gospel unto you THAN
[1:27:25] THAT WHICH WE HAVE ALREADY PREACHED UNTO
[1:27:28] YOU, LET HIM BE ACCURSED. NOW, WHAT WAS
[1:27:31] THE APOSTLES BRINGING? THEY WERE
[1:27:33] BRINGING THE ORIGINAL WORD. AND THE
[1:27:36] PROPHET OF GOD SAID THAT ORIGINAL WORD
[1:27:38] WAS NOT CHANGED or could not change. NOT
[1:27:41] EVEN A DOT OR DASH OF IT. PAUL KNEW IT
[1:27:44] WAS GOD WHO HAD SPOKEN TO HIM. SO he
[1:27:47] said, "EVEN IF I COME AND TRY TO GIVE A
[1:27:50] SECOND REVELATION, TRY TO MAKE one
[1:27:52] little change of what I GAVE
[1:27:53] ORIGINALLY." PAUL SAYS, "LET ME BE
[1:27:55] ACCURSED." SEE, PAUL KNEW, AMEN. THE
[1:27:58] FIRST REVELATION WAS CORRECT. NOW, GOD
[1:28:02] CANNOT GIVE A FIRST REVELATION AND THEN
[1:28:04] A SECOND REVELATION. IF HE DID, he would
[1:28:07] be changing his mind. He said he can
[1:28:10] GIVE A REVELATION AND BROTHER CHARLES
[1:28:12] SAID HE WILL ADD TO IT AS HE DID IN THE
[1:28:15] GARDEN OF EDEN WHEN HE PROMISED THE SEED
[1:28:18] TO THE WOMAN AND THEN LATER DESIGNATED
[1:28:21] THAT SEED HAD TO COME THROUGH ABRAHAM
[1:28:23] AND THEN LATER SAID IT WOULD COME BY THE
[1:28:26] SAME BLOODLINES AND DAVID LISTEN BUT IT
[1:28:28] WAS THE SAME REVELATION. IT ONLY GAVE
[1:28:31] the people MORE INFORMATION TO HELP THEM
[1:28:34] RECEIVE AND UNDERSTAND THIS. DON'T YOU
[1:28:37] SEE WHAT THIS MESSAGE IS? IT IS THE
[1:28:40] REVELATION OF WHAT PAUL SPOKE OF TO GIVE
[1:28:43] YOU MORE INFORMATION THAT YOU CAN
[1:28:45] RIGHTLY DIVIDE THE WORD OF TRUTH AND
[1:28:48] IDENTIFY YOUR HOUR. IDENTIFY WHAT DAY
[1:28:50] YOU'RE LIVING IN. MY TO THINK THIS
[1:28:53] MORNING the seed came exactly as
[1:28:56] revealed. Reme said, "One of these days
[1:28:59] there is going to come A PROPHET TO THE
[1:29:01] LEODYSIAN CHURCH AGE, AND YOU WILL KNOW
[1:29:04] IF HE IS THE real one sent from God or
[1:29:06] not." OH YES, YOU WILL. FOR HE IS OF
[1:29:09] GOD. HE WILL BE IN THAT word exactly
[1:29:14] AS GOD GAVE IT TO PAUL, BROTHER. HE
[1:29:17] WON'T DEVIATE from that word. AMEN. FOR
[1:29:19] A MOMENT, AMEN. NOT BY ONE IOTA. AMEN.
[1:29:23] I'M GOING TO PREACH THAT DEVIL OUT OF
[1:29:24] HERE IN A MINUTE. YOU CAN SIT THERE AND
[1:29:25] HOLD ON to it all you want to. AMEN. IN
[1:29:27] THE LAST AGE WHEN THERE WILL BE MANY
[1:29:29] FALSE PROPHETS APPEARING, WATCH AND SEE
[1:29:32] HOW THEY WILL KEEP TELLING YOU. IF YOU
[1:29:34] DON'T BELIEVE THEM AND WHAT THEY SAY,
[1:29:37] YOU WILL BE LOST. BUT WHEN THAT LAST DAY
[1:29:39] PROPHET COMES ON THE SCENE, IF HE IS
[1:29:42] TRULY THAT PROPHET, HE WILL BE CRYING
[1:29:44] OUT, "GET BACK TO THE WORD OR YOU ARE
[1:29:48] LOST." HE WILL NOT BUILD ON A PRIVATE
[1:29:51] REVELATION OR INTERPRETATION, BUT HE
[1:29:54] WILL BUILD ON THE WORD. SEE, ZACHCHARIAH
[1:29:58] WAS A VINDICATED PROPHET WHO WAS SENT,
[1:30:01] AMEN, TO MAKE GENESIS 3 MORE CLEARER.
[1:30:04] COME ON, FOLKS. IN GENESIS 3 IS THE SAME
[1:30:06] AS ZECHARIAH 9. BUT IT DON'T SAY THE
[1:30:09] SAME THING, DOES IT? AMEN. IT DON'T SAY
[1:30:11] IN GENESIS 3, AND HE WILL COME ON THE F
[1:30:13] OF AN ASH. AMEN. RIDING INTO JERUSALEM.
[1:30:16] BUT IN ZECHARIAH 9, IT GIVES MORE
[1:30:18] CLARIFICATION TO GENESIS 3. AMEN. AND
[1:30:21] THEN IN MATTHEW 21, ACROSS THE HILL,
[1:30:25] AMEN, COME THE WORD FULFILLED.
[1:30:29] &gt;&gt; ARE Y'ALL HEARING ME? ZACHCHARIAH MADE
[1:30:31] IT MORE CLEARER. AND THEY STILL MISSED
[1:30:33] IT. YOU KNOW WHAT HE DONE? HE DESCRIBED
[1:30:36] THE VERY ATMOSPHERE that that word WOULD
[1:30:39] BE MANIFESTED IN. HE SAID, "WHEN HE
[1:30:41] COMES, THEY WILL BE SHOUTING. THEY WILL
[1:30:44] BE SCREAMING. THEY WILL BE REJOICING
[1:30:47] HOSANA HOSANA AND HERE HE COME
[1:30:50] FULFILLING THE WORD. SEE BECAUSE GOD
[1:30:52] DON'T FOLLOW the word he don't fulfill
[1:30:55] his word rather according to the modern
[1:30:58] trend of the day.
[1:31:00] &gt;&gt; Now now folks God fulfills his word to
[1:31:02] the people.
[1:31:04] &gt;&gt; And when God fulfills his word it always
[1:31:08] causes an attraction.
[1:31:10] &gt;&gt; It always does.
[1:31:12] &gt;&gt; See now look here. SO UNUSUAL WHEN HE
[1:31:15] FULFILLS his word to the modern trend of
[1:31:18] that day. NOW LOOK HERE CAUSE THE MODERN
[1:31:21] TREND OF THE DAY THEY don't even believe
[1:31:24] in it. NOW I WANT TO SAY THIS THE BIBLE
[1:31:27] IS full of unusual attractions. Amen.
[1:31:31] NOAH BUILDING AN ARK WAS AN UNUSUAL
[1:31:33] ATTRACTION. THE BURNING BUSH WAS AN
[1:31:35] UNUSUAL ATTRACTION. AMEN. THE OPEN OF
[1:31:37] THE RED SEA unusual attraction. MOUNT SI
[1:31:40] WHEN GOD MET MOSES IN THE FORM OF THE
[1:31:42] PILLAR OF FIRE, UNUSUAL ATTRACTION.
[1:31:45] MOUNT CARMEL, WHEN ELIJAH STOOD THERE
[1:31:47] AGAINST THE 400 priest ON THAT HILL.
[1:31:49] AMEN. IT WAS UNUSUAL. AMEN. WHEN GOD
[1:31:51] FULFILLED ISAIAH 40 ON THE RIVER JORDAN
[1:31:54] THROUGH JOHN THE BAPTIST, AMEN. IT WAS
[1:31:56] UNUSUAL. BUT YOU SEE WHAT'S HAPPENING IS
[1:31:58] THE ATTRACTION IS CHANGING. ARE YOU WITH
[1:32:01] ME? The attraction is changing. AMEN.
[1:32:04] FROM THE PROPHET UNTO HIS PROPHECY. NOW
[1:32:07] SEE ST. MATTHEW 3. AMEN. You can read
[1:32:09] the Bible of Isaiah 40. Are you with me?
[1:32:12] &gt;&gt; Are are you awake?
[1:32:14] &gt;&gt; Amen. AMEN. SHAKE YOURSELF. ISAIAH 40.
[1:32:17] AMEN. WAS FULFILLED IN MATTHEW 3. AMEN.
[1:32:19] GOD WAS VINDICATING HIS PROPHET'S
[1:32:22] MESSAGE. AMEN. WHAT ABOUT THAT
[1:32:23] ATTRACTION UP THERE ON MOUNT CALVARY?
[1:32:26] AMEN. WHEN THE PROPHECY OF THE OLD
[1:32:28] TESTAMENT WAS BEING FULFILLED RIGHT
[1:32:30] THERE, BROTHER TOM, AT CALVARY, AND THEY
[1:32:32] STILL DIDN'T KNOW IT. WHEN DAVID SUNG
[1:32:34] THE PSALM OF HOW THE SPIRIT OF CHRIST
[1:32:37] WAS IN HIM BEING FULFILLED, HE SAYS,
[1:32:39] "WHAT WAS THE ATTRACTION ON MOUNT
[1:32:41] CALVARY? IT WAS GOD FULFILLING HIS
[1:32:44] WORD." ON THE DAY OF PENTECOST, WHAT
[1:32:47] HAPPENED, BROTHER, WHEN THEY COME
[1:32:48] STAGGERED OUT OF THE UPPER ROOM LIKE A
[1:32:51] BUNCH OF DRUNK MEN, THE PROPHET OF GOD
[1:32:53] SAID, "AMEN." AND A PROPHET STOOD UP
[1:32:54] AMONG THEM. I LOVE THAT. A PROPHET STOOD
[1:32:58] UP AMONG THEM AS THE ORDER OF A PROPHET
[1:33:01] SHOULD BE AND SAID, "YE MEN OF ISRAEL,
[1:33:04] AND YOU THAT DWELL IN JUDEA AND IN
[1:33:06] JERUSALEM, LET this be KNOWN UNTO YOU,
[1:33:09] AND HEARKEN TO MY WORD. THESE ARE NOT
[1:33:11] DRUNK LIKE YOU THINK THEY ARE. BUT THIS
[1:33:14] IS THAT WHICH WAS SPOKEN OF BY THE
[1:33:17] PROPHET JOEL." LISTEN, WITHOUT A
[1:33:19] PROPHET, YOU CANNOT IDENTIFY WHAT'S
[1:33:22] HAPPENING. BUT IF GOD SENDS A PROPHET,
[1:33:24] HE'LL BE A WORD PROPHET. HE'LL BE A
[1:33:27] SCRIPTURAL PROPHET. HE WILL NOT POINT TO
[1:33:29] HIMSELF. HE WILL NOT ATTRACT YOU TO A
[1:33:31] CHURCH. HE WILL SAY, "THIS is that."
[1:33:35] &gt;&gt; Oh, the religious people were crucifying
[1:33:38] THE PRINCE OF LIFE, EVERYTHING. AND THEY
[1:33:41] STILL DIDN'T SEE THE PROMISE OF THE
[1:33:43] COMING OF THE HOLY SPIRIT. YOU KNOW WHAT
[1:33:46] THEY SAID? WHO IS THIS? COME ON. I'M
[1:33:49] PREACHING TO YOU THIS MORNING. WHAT
[1:33:50] MEANTH THIS? WHAT'S THE MATTER WITH THEM
[1:33:53] PEOPLE? OH MY. IT'S THE SAME THING
[1:33:55] TODAY. COME ON. ARE YOU HEARING ME? THIS
[1:33:58] IS NOT AN EXTRA
[1:34:00] THIS IS NOT AN EXTRACURRICULAR BIBLE
[1:34:02] MESSAGE. THIS IS A BIBLE MESSAGE BEING
[1:34:05] FULFILLED IN YOUR GENERATION. [laughter]
[1:34:08] COME ON. I'm going to preach A SECOND.
[1:34:10] AMEN. CUZ I DON'T THINK OUR SHOUTING
[1:34:12] OUGHT TO BE CONTROLLED BY THE MUSIC. I
[1:34:14] DON'T THINK OUR ATTITUDE AND OUR MOOD
[1:34:16] OUGHT TO BE CONTROLLED BY THE NUMBER OF
[1:34:18] PEOPLE ON THE PEWS OR BY HOW MANY PEOPLE
[1:34:20] IS LIKING OUR SERVICES AND WATCHING OUR
[1:34:23] SERVICES. COME ON, I'M GOING TO PREACH
[1:34:24] AND I'M GOING TO BUST THAT DEVIL AND YOU
[1:34:26] CAN SIT THERE AND WATCH ME. DON'T YOU
[1:34:28] REDUCE THIS MESSAGE DOWN TO ANOTHER
[1:34:30] SECULAR HOLLYWOOD SHOW OF WHAT CHURCH IS
[1:34:33] DOING THIS AND WHO CAN OUT PREACH WHO
[1:34:35] AND WHO CAN OUTSHOUT WHO. THIS IS THE
[1:34:38] FULFILLING OF THE WORD OF GOD IN THE
[1:34:41] GENERATION WE'RE LIVING IN. IT OUGHT TO
[1:34:43] BE MORE THAN A SUNDAY MORNING SERVICE.
[1:34:45] IT OUGHT TO BE MORE THAN A CAMP MEETING.
[1:34:47] IT OUGHT TO BE A REVIVAL BURNING IN THE
[1:34:50] HEARTS OF BELIEVERS.
[1:34:52] GOD IS HERE. HE'S IN OUR MIDST. BROTHER
[1:34:55] [laughter] MATT, HE'S FULFILLING HIS
[1:34:57] WORD.
[1:35:00] &gt;&gt; Oh my goodness. My church, our church,
[1:35:02] hogwash. [laughter]
[1:35:05] &gt;&gt; Ain't about my church and your church.
[1:35:06] And well, IF OUR CHURCH WOULD LIKE this
[1:35:08] church, if this church WOULD LIKE THAT,
[1:35:10] FORGET IT ALL. THIS IS ABOUT A BRIDE
[1:35:12] COMING TO PERFECTION UNDER THE MESSAGE
[1:35:15] OF THE HOUR.
[1:35:18] &gt;&gt; WELL, [snorts]
[1:35:20] [sighs and gasps]
[1:35:22] THE SAME THING IS TODAY. THE SAME THING
[1:35:25] IS TAKING PLACE. NOW, NOW I GOT A
[1:35:27] QUESTION FOR YOU, OKAY? CUZ B SAID
[1:35:30] PEOPLE BEGIN TO JUDGE THE SPIRITUALITY
[1:35:31] OF THINGS BY HOW MANY'S ATTENDING IT.
[1:35:34] &gt;&gt; Remember that? He said, WELL, THEY SAID,
[1:35:36] WELL, OUR CHURCH IS REALLY BLESSED CUZ
[1:35:38] THIS YEAR we got MORE MEMBERS THAN
[1:35:39] SOMEBODY ELSE. HIM SAID, "WELL," HE
[1:35:41] SAID, "SO DID PROSTITUTION GO UP."
[1:35:44] HE SAID, "SO IS THAT BLESSED OF GOD?"
[1:35:47] COME ON. I'M GOING TO PREACH. YOU SIT
[1:35:48] THERE LICK HIM IF YOU WANT TO. IS THAT
[1:35:50] BLESSED OF GOD? SAID, "NO." HE SAID,
[1:35:52] "IT'S CURSED TO THE DEVIL. YOU CANNOT
[1:35:55] VINDICATE THE BLESSINGS OF GOD BY THE
[1:35:58] NUMBER OF ATTENDEES."
[1:36:00] &gt;&gt; He say, "WHAT ARE YOU SAYING?" I'M
[1:36:02] SAYING, "CHURCH, YOU ARE SITTING IN A
[1:36:03] CHURCH THIS MORNING." AMEN. That just A
[1:36:05] FEW YEARS AGO WAS A CHURCH OF ABOUT 14
[1:36:08] PEOPLE. AMEN. BUT TODAY, AMEN, GOD HAS
[1:36:11] SENT PEOPLE INTO THIS ASSEMBLY TO BE A
[1:36:13] PART OF THIS CHURCH. AMEN. YOU KNOW WHAT
[1:36:15] THAT IS? IT'S NOT BECAUSE OF MATT
[1:36:17] MORRIS. IT'S NOT BECAUSE OF ANDREW
[1:36:19] GLOVER. IT'S NOT BECAUSE OF ANYTHING,
[1:36:21] BUT ONE THING. THE WORD OF GOD HAS BEEN
[1:36:24] FULFILLED AND IT'S CAUSED AN ATTRACTION
[1:36:27] AND SOMEBODY SAYS, "I WANT TO BE THERE.
[1:36:30] I WANT TO WORSHIP IT. I WANT TO BE A
[1:36:32] PART OF IT."
[1:36:36] &gt;&gt; WELL, GLORY TO GOD. HALLELUJAH. NOW, NOW
[1:36:39] [snorts] people say, "Brother Ed, you're
[1:36:40] getting way out there." I love a
[1:36:42] prophet's humility.
[1:36:43] &gt;&gt; HE SAYS, "THIS MORNING, I WAS LEAVING
[1:36:46] THE CHURCH AND AS I WAS DRIVING BY, THE
[1:36:49] THOUGHT COME IN MY MIND, WHAT'S ALL THAT
[1:36:51] RACKET?"
[1:36:52] &gt;&gt; HE SAID, "I LOOKED UP AND DOWN THE
[1:36:54] STREET AND THERE WAS CARS FROM MICHIGAN
[1:36:56] TO FLORIDA, FROM MAINE TO CALIFORNIA.
[1:37:00] This morning WHEN I WAS RIDING OUT, WE
[1:37:03] WAS GOING DOWN THE STREET AND THE WIFE
[1:37:05] AND I WAS LOOKING AT LICENSE ON CARS AND
[1:37:07] I SAID THIS, "WHAT MEANTH THIS?" AND
[1:37:10] JUST AS I SAID IT, SOMETHING SPOKE AND
[1:37:14] SAID, "WHERE THE CARCASS IS?"
[1:37:17] WHERE THE CARCASS IS, THERE THE EAGLES
[1:37:20] WILL BE GATHERED TOGETHER.
[1:37:22] &gt;&gt; COME ON, CHURCH. DO YOU REALIZE IN THE
[1:37:24] FIRST POOL JEFFERSON FILLED UP THE
[1:37:26] TABERNACLE? IN THE SECOND POOL, THEY
[1:37:28] FILLED UP THE TABERNACLE. BUT WHEN IT
[1:37:30] COME TO THAT THIRD PULL, AMEN, THEY
[1:37:32] BEGIN TO PULL AWAY. AMEN. YOU KNOW WHY?
[1:37:34] AMEN. BECAUSE THAT THIRD PULL WAS NOT
[1:37:37] ATTRACTING A CROWD. IT WAS ATTRACTING
[1:37:39] THOSE WHO WERE ORDAINED TO THE CLOUD.
[1:37:43] WOO! GLORY. THAT THIRD PULL WAS NOT
[1:37:46] ATTRACTING A CROWD. IT WAS ATTRACTING
[1:37:48] BELIEVERS WHO WAS A PART OF THE CLOUD OF
[1:37:52] REVELATION 10. OH, GRACE TABERNACLE. I
[1:37:55] SAY UNTO YOU THIS MORNING, WHAT IS THE
[1:37:57] ATTRACTION? ON LAWRENCE COUNTY ROAD IN
[1:37:59] BLACK ROCKCK, ARKANSAS. THE CLOUD HAS
[1:38:02] APPEARED. THE POWER OF GOD HAS RETURNED.
[1:38:06] AND THERE'S A PEOPLE WHO'S READY TO LOOK
[1:38:08] AT IT. THERE'S A PEOPLE WHO'S READY TO
[1:38:11] PRAISE IT. THEY'RE READY TO SAY,
[1:38:13] "HOSANA."
[1:38:16] &gt;&gt; OH, they'll come from the east and west.
[1:38:18] They'll come from the lands of far to
[1:38:21] feast with our king, to dine as his
[1:38:23] guest. Rem said, "What is the
[1:38:25] attraction? the predestinated seed of
[1:38:28] God who can't do nothing else but follow
[1:38:30] it
[1:38:33] &gt;&gt; BUT FOLLOW IT.
[1:38:35] &gt;&gt; IT MEANS MORE THAN LIFE TO US.
[1:38:40] [sighs and gasps]
[1:38:41] &gt;&gt; TAKE OUR LIVES BUT DON'T TAKE THAT.
[1:38:45] &gt;&gt; WHAT IS THE ATTRACTION? GOD FULFILLING
[1:38:49] THE WORD OF ZACHCHARIAH. Are y'all ready
[1:38:51] for this
[1:38:54] &gt;&gt; again? Amen.
[1:38:57] [snorts]
[1:39:01] &gt;&gt; Again.
[1:39:04] &gt;&gt; No.
[1:39:06] &gt;&gt; Again.
[1:39:08] &gt;&gt; Zachchariah in the Bible.
[1:39:11] Word fulfilled.
[1:39:13] &gt;&gt; Again. Yes.
[1:39:15] &gt;&gt; SEE, IT SHALL COME TO PASS IN that day
[1:39:19] &gt;&gt; THAT THE LIGHT SHALL NOT BE CLEAR NOR
[1:39:20] DARK, BUT IT SHALL BE ONE DAY WHICH
[1:39:24] SHALL BE KNOWN TO THE LORD, NOT DAY NOR
[1:39:27] NIGHT, BUT IT SHALL [screaming] COME TO
[1:39:30] PASS.
[1:39:32] &gt;&gt; THAT at evening TIME IT SHALL BE LIGHT.
[1:39:37] &gt;&gt; SEE, WHAT DOES LIGHT COME ON? IT COMES
[1:39:39] ON SOMETHING TO BRING ATTENTION TO IT.
[1:39:43] COME ON, CHURCH. AMEN. THE MESSAGE OF
[1:39:45] THE HOUR. AMEN. IS CHRIST THROWING LIGHT
[1:39:48] ON THE SCRIPTURES CONCERNING YOU.
[1:39:53] &gt;&gt; NOW, Brother says it beautifully. He
[1:39:55] says, "We see the evening lights are
[1:39:56] here." Now, what does it do to have
[1:39:58] light if you don't have any eyes to see
[1:40:01] how to get around in it?
[1:40:04] &gt;&gt; Now, what is the evening light? The
[1:40:06] light comes on to reveal something.
[1:40:09] &gt;&gt; Is that right? Now, if you haven't got
[1:40:11] any eyes, then what's the use to reveal?
[1:40:14] There has to be eyes first to see, to
[1:40:17] reveal Malachi 4, to reveal Luke 17:30,
[1:40:21] to reveal John 14:12, John 15:24, John
[1:40:25] 16:13, and to also reveal Revelation
[1:40:28] 10:1-7,
[1:40:30] the opening of the seven seals. The
[1:40:33] seventh angel's message is to open up to
[1:40:36] reveal when the evening lights come.
[1:40:40] Now, folks, I'm I'm I'm not going to
[1:40:42] preach all day. I'm I'm preaching to
[1:40:44] affliction in my body, but I'm going to
[1:40:46] get through it. But but listen to ME
[1:40:48] RIGHT NOW. LIGHT HAS COME ON THIS WORD
[1:40:51] TO REVEAL IT UNTO YOU.
[1:40:55] &gt;&gt; SEE, IT'S LIKE IT'S LIKE YOU WALK IN A
[1:40:56] DARK ROOM. I've used this many times.
[1:40:58] You walk in a dark room and brother
[1:41:00] David, you're walking through there and
[1:41:01] you trip over something. Okay? You trip
[1:41:03] over it. Now, you turn around and
[1:41:05] there's NO LIGHT. YOU DON'T KNOW WHAT
[1:41:07] YOU JUST STUMBLED OVER. SO YOU CALL
[1:41:09] JONAH AND YOU SAY, "HEY JONAH, I JUST
[1:41:11] WON'T THERE." AND I STUMBLED OVER
[1:41:12] SOMETHING. WHAT DID YOU TRIP OVER? AND
[1:41:14] JONAH SAYS, "WELL, it's a chair." OKAY.
[1:41:16] AND THEN YOU ASK, "BROTHER MARK, WHAT
[1:41:17] THAT TRIP OVER?" AND HE SAYS, "WELL, I
[1:41:19] think it was a microphone stand." AND
[1:41:22] THEN YOU ASK BROTHER MATT, "WHAT THAT
[1:41:23] TRIP OVER?" AND YOU SAY, "WELL, I think
[1:41:25] it was the corner OF THE PULL PIT."
[1:41:27] OKAY, NOW YOU'VE GOT THREE
[1:41:28] INTERPRETATIONS OF ONE OBJECT.
[1:41:31] &gt;&gt; WHICH ONE ARE YOU GOING TO FOCUS ON?
[1:41:35] &gt;&gt; Which one are YOU GOING TO CONCENTRATE?
[1:41:36] IS IT A CHAIR? IS IT A MICROPHONE STAND?
[1:41:39] IS IT THE CORNER OF A PULL PIT? WHO IS
[1:41:41] RIGHT? WHAT DO WE FOLLOW? WHAT DO WE
[1:41:44] FOCUS ON? OH, BUT THEN THERE'S A MAN WHO
[1:41:48] CAN TURN ON THE LIGHT AND HE STEPS IN
[1:41:50] THE ROOM AND HE FLIPS A LIGHT SWITCH AND
[1:41:53] THE LIGHT STRIKES THE OBJECT AND FOR THE
[1:41:56] FIRST TIME, EVERY OPINION LOSES its own.
[1:41:59] AND WE NOW HAVE A VINDICATED ANSWER.
[1:42:02] IT'S NOT A CHAIR. IT'S NOT A MICROPHONE
[1:42:05] STAND. IT'S A MONITOR. ARE Y'ALL HEARING
[1:42:07] ME? AND FOR YEARS THEY WERE WALKING
[1:42:10] THROUGH THE SCRIPTURES AND THEY WERE
[1:42:11] STUMBLING OVER JUSTIFICATION. THEY WERE
[1:42:14] STUMBLING OVER THE RAPTURE. THEY WERE
[1:42:15] STUMBLING OVER WATER BAPTISM. BUT IN THE
[1:42:18] EVENING TIME IT SHALL BE LIGHT. THE MAN
[1:42:21] WILL BE HERE WHO WILL TURN ON THE LIGHT
[1:42:24] AND BROTHER NOAH FOR THE FIRST TIME.
[1:42:26] AMEN. A YOUNG MAN CAN LOOK AT THINGS
[1:42:28] THAT HAVE CONFUSED THEOLOGIANS AND SAY
[1:42:30] THIS IS the truth.
[1:42:34] ARE YOU HEARING ME? WHAT'S HAPPENING ON
[1:42:36] MOUNT SUNSET. IT'S GOD CONFIRMING HIS
[1:42:39] WORD. I'M TELLING YOU FOLKS, IT'S TIME
[1:42:41] TO WAKE UP.
[1:42:43] &gt;&gt; IT'S TIME TO WAKE UP. THERE'S A CONTRAST
[1:42:46] OF PEOPLE IN THE WORLD TODAY. I'M GOING
[1:42:49] TO BRING IT ON DOWN CLOSER TO HOME.
[1:42:51] &gt;&gt; IS THAT OKAY?
[1:42:52] &gt;&gt; THERE'S A CONTRAST OF PEOPLE IN THE
[1:42:55] RANKS OF OUR MESSAGE. IT'S THOSE WHO ARE
[1:42:57] SENSITIZED AND THOSE WHO ARE
[1:42:59] DESENSITIZED.
[1:43:01] AND SENSITIZED MEANS YOU'RE CAUSED
[1:43:04] SOMEONE OR SOMETHING TO RESPOND.
[1:43:10] &gt;&gt; TO MAKE SENSITIVE TO LIGHT.
[1:43:13] &gt;&gt; WHEN SOMETHING IS DESENSITIZED, YOU MAKE
[1:43:15] IT LESS SENSITIVE. BROTHER BRIAN, YOU
[1:43:18] MAKE SOMEONE LESS LIKELY TO FEEL THE
[1:43:22] SHOCK OR TO RESPOND TO WHAT IS
[1:43:24] HAPPENING. NOW, CAN I HAVE my liberty,
[1:43:27] brother Matt? TO MAKE SOMEONE LESS
[1:43:30] LIKELY TO FEEL THE DISTRESS AT THE SCENE
[1:43:33] OF CRUELTY OF VIOLENCE OR SUFFERING BY
[1:43:37] OVEREXPOSURE TO SUCH IMAGES. IT MEANS TO
[1:43:41] FREE SOMEONE FROM A PHOBIA OR NEUROSIS
[1:43:45] BY GRADUALLY EXPOSING THE PERSON TO THE
[1:43:48] THING THAT IS FEARED. NOW, NOW COME ON
[1:43:52] FOLKS, I'M GOING TO PREACH FOR A SECOND.
[1:43:53] AMEN. BECAUSE WE CANNOT WONDER WHY OUR
[1:43:56] SCHOOLS ARE BEING SHOT UP WHEN WE'VE HAD
[1:43:58] KIDS FOR 20 YEARS IN BEDROOMS PLAYING
[1:44:01] VIDEO GAMES, GOING IN BUILDINGS, AND
[1:44:04] MASSACRING PEOPLE LEFT AND RIGHT. I'M
[1:44:06] PREACHING TO YOU. WE CANNOT BE TRYING TO
[1:44:08] FIGURE OUT WHY RAPE IS AT AN ALL-TIME
[1:44:11] HIGH WHEN WE'VE HAD MUSIC THAT HAS DONE
[1:44:13] NOTHING BUT PROMOTE FILTH AND HAS
[1:44:16] DEVALUED WOMEN. AND
[1:44:19] COME ON, IT'S THE AGE OF DESENSITATION.
[1:44:21] desens where's my wife and I need her.
[1:44:24] She's got an English degree. IT'S THE
[1:44:26] AGE OF DESENSITIZING. THE WORLD IS
[1:44:29] DESENSITIZING YOU TO MAKE YOU NUMB TO
[1:44:32] WHAT'S HAPPENING. THEY'RE MAKING YOU
[1:44:34] NUMB TO WHAT'S GOING ON. COME ON. THAT'S
[1:44:36] WHY AMEN. 50 YEARS AGO, BROTHER BROTHER
[1:44:40] DAVID, 50 YEARS AGO, IF YOU WERE WALKING
[1:44:42] DOWN THE STREET AND SAW A BOY AND
[1:44:44] ANOTHER BOY HOLD HANDS AND KISSING,
[1:44:46] YOU'D HAVE TO FIND A TRASH CAN TO THROW
[1:44:48] UP IN. BUT TODAY, AMEN. IT'S ALL OVER
[1:44:50] THE PLACE. AMEN. 50 YEARS AGO. Come on.
[1:44:54] I'm I'll be How old am I? 29. I'LL BE 30
[1:44:57] IN A FEW DAYS. I REMEMBER IN SCHOOL,
[1:45:01] SORRY, just kind of forgot for a second.
[1:45:03] Help me, JESUS. I REMEMBER IN SCHOOL
[1:45:06] WHEN A GIRL COME IN ACTING LIKE SHE
[1:45:08] LIKED A GIRL. IT WAS IT WAS [gasps] IT
[1:45:11] WAS THE WEIRDEST THING EVER. BUT TODAY,
[1:45:13] THEY GOT SUPPORT GROUPS FOR IT. DO YOU
[1:45:16] KNOW HOW WE GOT HERE? IS BECAUSE
[1:45:18] SOMEBODY BEGAN TO PROPAGATE SOMETHING
[1:45:21] UNTIL THEY DESENSITIZED AN ENTIRE
[1:45:23] GENERATION AND THEY NO LONGER FEEL THE
[1:45:25] SHOCK OF THE FILTH OF SODOM. THEY NO
[1:45:28] LONGER FEEL THE SHOCK OF THE VIOLENCE.
[1:45:30] IT'S STILL IN OUR STREETS. OH WELL, IF
[1:45:32] IT'S HAPPENING IN THE NATURAL, IT'S
[1:45:35] HAPPENING IN THE SPIRITUAL. MEN HAVE
[1:45:37] TAKEN THIS MESSAGE AND HAVE WATERED IT
[1:45:39] DOWN TO ANOTHER IDEA, TO ANOTHER
[1:45:42] APPROACH, AND THEY HAVE DESENSITIZED THE
[1:45:44] PEOPLE TO THE REALITY. THIS IS ZECHARIAH
[1:45:47] 14. THIS IS MALACHI 4. THIS IS LUKE
[1:45:51] 17:30. THIS IS REVELATION 5. THIS IS
[1:45:54] REVELATIONS 10. THIS IS THE BOOK OF JOHN
[1:45:56] THE 14TH CHAPTER.
[1:46:01] &gt;&gt; Sensitize you. [panting]
[1:46:06] [snorts]
[1:46:07] &gt;&gt; Can I preach a second?
[1:46:09] [panting and sighs]
[1:46:10] &gt;&gt; They desensitize you to the attraction
[1:46:13] by distractions.
[1:46:18] Brother David, they set up distractions
[1:46:21] around the attraction
[1:46:23] &gt;&gt; to desensitize you
[1:46:25] &gt;&gt; so when you see it, you won't be so
[1:46:28] moved by it.
[1:46:31] &gt;&gt; Brother, I'm going to preach a second.
[1:46:34] Is that okay, pastor?
[1:46:36] &gt;&gt; Back last year, we went down to Memphis.
[1:46:39] We went down there and and saw the uh
[1:46:41] they [laughter] down there in uh
[1:46:43] Memphis. They've got a
[1:46:45] &gt;&gt; [snorts]
[1:46:46] &gt;&gt; I'm gonna get it out. Boo devil.
[1:46:51] I'm not contagious, folks.
[1:46:56] One day it's 80, the next day at 16. Are
[1:46:58] you with me?
[1:47:00] &gt;&gt; Okay. We go down there to Memphis and
[1:47:02] there's a National Rights Museum and
[1:47:04] Civil Rights Museum. And it's actually
[1:47:05] the very location where Martin Luther
[1:47:07] King Jr. was shot and killed on the
[1:47:09] balcony of that Lorraine motel. And we
[1:47:12] got out. We was walking in and Matt
[1:47:13] noticed over on the corner like as
[1:47:15] you're walking up there too and on the
[1:47:16] corner there there was a woman sitting
[1:47:18] there with a stand with a bunch of
[1:47:21] pictures and a bunch of a bunch of
[1:47:22] paraphernalia, a bunch of propaganda,
[1:47:24] whatever papers handing them out. And so
[1:47:27] I remember Matt said, "I wonder what
[1:47:28] THAT'S ABOUT." WELL, I GOT TO LOOKING it
[1:47:30] up and you know what it actually is?
[1:47:32] It's a woman named Jacqueline Smith. AND
[1:47:35] YOU KNOW WHAT? She has been there in a
[1:47:37] solitary protest against that Lorraine
[1:47:40] motel in Memphis, Tennessee since 1988.
[1:47:44] SINCE 1988, THAT WOMAN HAS NOT MOVED.
[1:47:48] SHE HAS SAT THERE. Oh god, this is on
[1:47:50] YouTube.
[1:47:52] I'm going to PREACH Y'ALL. SHE HAS NOT
[1:47:54] MOVED. SHE'S NOT SAT THERE. SHE'S NOT
[1:47:57] SHE SAT THERE FOR FOR FOR FOR 37 years
[1:48:02] now. YOU SAY, "WHY in the world is she
[1:48:05] sitting there protesting for 37 years?"
[1:48:09] Well, when Martin Luther King Jr. came
[1:48:11] there, that hotel was a CHEAP MOTEL THAT
[1:48:14] THEY RENTED rooms to people at a very
[1:48:16] reasonable rate. And it was actually
[1:48:18] MORE OR LESS HOUSING FOR PEOPLE. But
[1:48:20] when he was killed up ON THE BALCONY,
[1:48:22] THEY STARTED LOOKING AT CHANGING that
[1:48:24] thing and making it more of A MONUMENT
[1:48:26] OR MUSEUM. AND SHE HAD A ROOM IN IT. SHE
[1:48:29] WAS LIVING IN THAT MOTEL. AND SO THEY
[1:48:31] WENT TO AND THEY SAID, "LOOK, WE'RE
[1:48:32] GOING TO MAKE THIS A WE'RE GOING TO MAKE
[1:48:33] THIS A A MUSEUM. You got to move out.
[1:48:35] I'm not moving out. NO, YOU GOT TO MOVE
[1:48:38] OUT. WE'RE GOING TO MAKE THIS A MUSEUM."
[1:48:40] AND SO WHAT SHE DONE WAS SHE BEGAN TO
[1:48:42] BUILD A PLATFORM of protest on THE BASIS
[1:48:45] OF THIS. NOW, WHEN YOU GO OVER THERE AND
[1:48:47] ASK HER, "WHY ARE YOU HERE?" SHE'LL TELL
[1:48:48] YOU THIS. MARTIN LUTHER KING JR.
[1:48:50] WOULDN'T STAND for this.
[1:48:55] &gt;&gt; Can I preach a second?
[1:48:57] SHE BEGINS TO CHANGE AND BEGINS TO TRY
[1:49:00] TO DISTRACT YOU FROM WHAT YOU'RE GOING
[1:49:02] TO SEE. SHE WANTS YOU TO WALK AND SHE'LL
[1:49:04] TELL YOU THIS. SHE'LL SAY, "THEY
[1:49:06] LITERALLY PICKED ME UP AND CARRIED ME
[1:49:08] OUT OF MY ROOM AND I SAT DOWN HERE TO TO
[1:49:12] PROTEST THIS MUSEUM BECAUSE IT'S NOT
[1:49:15] WHAT MARTIN LUTHER KING JR. WOULD WANT."
[1:49:17] AND NOW WHAT SHE'S DOING, SHE'S
[1:49:19] DESENSITIZING YOU TO GET SOMETHING IN
[1:49:21] YOUR MIND THAT WHEN YOU WALK IN THAT
[1:49:23] BUILDING THAT IT WILL NOT HAVE THE
[1:49:25] EFFECT UPON YOU AS YOU'RE LOOKING AT
[1:49:28] THINGS, YOU'LL BE THINKING ABOUT THAT
[1:49:30] POOR OLD WOMAN OUT THERE THAT GOT KICKED
[1:49:32] OUT OF HER MOTEL ROOM BECAUSE THEY
[1:49:34] TURNED IT INTO A MUSEUM.
[1:49:37] &gt;&gt; WELL, I'M GOING TO PREACH A SECOND.
[1:49:38] THAT'S THE WAY SOME OF YOU DO ABOUT THIS
[1:49:40] MESSAGE. THAT'S THE WAY SOME OF YOU DO
[1:49:42] ABOUT RELATIONSHIPS AND FRIENDSHIPS IS
[1:49:44] FOR YEARS YOU'VE BEEN SITTING THERE
[1:49:46] TRYING TO DESENSITIZE PEOPLE BECAUSE OF
[1:49:48] SOME LITTLE ILL FEELING OR SOME LITTLE
[1:49:50] CROSSWORD OR THE WAY SOME SITUATION WAS
[1:49:52] HANDLED. BUT I WANT TO TELL YOU THIS IN
[1:49:54] THE NAME OF THE LORD. IT'S TIME TO PACK
[1:49:56] UP YOUR PROTEST. IT'S TIME TO REALIZE
[1:49:59] THIS AIN'T ABOUT YOU. THIS AIN'T ABOUT
[1:50:01] ME. IT'S ABOUT THE ATTRACTION. COME ON.
[1:50:04] AIN'T NOBODY COMING IN FROM AROUND THE
[1:50:06] WORLD TO SEE THAT WOMAN SITTING THERE.
[1:50:08] THEY'RE COMING TO SEE WHERE MARTIN
[1:50:10] LUTHER KING STOOD. WELL, I MIGHT AS WELL
[1:50:12] PREACH. AND THERE AIN'T NOBODY COMING TO
[1:50:14] THIS MESSAGE TO SEE HOW IMPORTANT YOU
[1:50:16] ARE OR HOW UNIMPORTANT YOU ARE. HOW
[1:50:19] LIKED YOU ARE OR HOW UNLIKE YOU ARE.
[1:50:21] THEY ARE COMING TO THIS MESSAGE TO SEE
[1:50:23] ONE THING. THAT'S THE GOD OF THIS BIBLE
[1:50:26] HAS RAISED FROM THE DEAD. AND THE
[1:50:28] REVELATION IS BROKE. AND THERE'S
[1:50:30] SOMETHING IN THIS WORD CONCERNING ME.
[1:50:36] NOW, now
[1:50:40] [snorts]
[1:50:42] I read an interview.
[1:50:44] Somebody said these words. [gasps]
[1:50:47] They said, "We interviewed Miss Smith."
[1:50:50] And we asked her, "Why are you doing
[1:50:52] this?" And she responded, [snorts]
[1:50:57] "If they really cared, that museum
[1:50:59] wouldn't be there."
[1:51:02] You see what I'm talking about?
[1:51:05] People get in their mind about things.
[1:51:07] It's getting real heavy in here right
[1:51:08] now.
[1:51:10] &gt;&gt; God have mercy.
[1:51:12] &gt;&gt; I'm not a crazy man. People get things
[1:51:13] in their mind. They start focusing on it
[1:51:15] and they start concentrating on it and
[1:51:17] they get so attracted to it and they
[1:51:19] start desensitizing themselves and then
[1:51:22] before long they start trying to
[1:51:23] desensitize others.
[1:51:25] &gt;&gt; Listen, if you want to DESENSITIZE
[1:51:26] YOURSELF, GO ON. BUT IF YOU START TRYING
[1:51:28] TO DESENSITIZE others to what GOD IS
[1:51:31] DOING, GOD HAVE MERCY on your soul.
[1:51:34] I'm not a crazy man. I'm the word
[1:51:36] preacher and I'm in the burn right now.
[1:51:39] &gt;&gt; Well, this message is this AND THIS. NO,
[1:51:41] THIS MESSAGE IS CHRIST.
[1:51:43] &gt;&gt; And you CAN BUILD ALL THE PROTESTING
[1:51:45] WEBSITES YOU WANT TO AND AT THE END OF
[1:51:46] THE DAY, THE MESSAGE WILL STILL BE
[1:51:48] CHRIST BECAUSE IT'S THE ATTRACTION OF
[1:51:51] THE BRIDE.
[1:51:52] &gt;&gt; YOU SAY, "PREACHER, YOU LOST YOUR MIND."
[1:51:54] I HAVEN'T LOST MY MIND. I GOT ONE
[1:51:56] QUESTION FOR YOU. OKAY? WHY ARE YOU
[1:51:58] HERE?
[1:52:00] &gt;&gt; Why are you here? AMEN. CAN CAN I TELL
[1:52:02] Y'ALL SOMETHING? DON'T GET MAD AT ME.
[1:52:04] AMEN. MISS SMITH IS A SIDESHOW. IT'S
[1:52:06] JUST A LITTLE IT'S JUST A LITTLE
[1:52:07] SIDESHOW DOWN THERE. AMEN. TO KEEP YOUR
[1:52:09] EYES OFF OF WHAT MARTIN LUTHER KING DONE
[1:52:12] AND ALL THOSE THINGS IN THERE. IT'S JUST
[1:52:14] A SIDESHOW. AND I THINK IT'S TIME WE AS
[1:52:16] THE BRIDE OF JESUS CHRIST START
[1:52:18] IDENTIFYING WHAT SIDESHOWS ARE. THAT'S
[1:52:21] TRYING TO GET OUR ATTENTION OFF OF
[1:52:23] SEEING THE REVELATION CONTAINED IN THOSE
[1:52:25] SEVEN SEALS.
[1:52:28] &gt;&gt; Why are you here?
[1:52:30] &gt;&gt; Got a question for you, Carter. Why are
[1:52:31] YOU HERE, BROTHER MARK? WHY ARE YOU
[1:52:33] HERE? MATT, WHY ARE YOU HERE, BROTHER?
[1:52:35] BROTHER ROY, WHY ARE YOU HERE, BROTHER
[1:52:38] ED? WHY ARE YOU HERE, [gasps]
[1:52:41] BROTHER? BROTHER JARED, WHY ARE WE HERE?
[1:52:44] BRE SAID, "IF YOU'RE A REAL BELIEVER,
[1:52:45] YOU'RE SITTING HERE AND WANTING TO SERVE
[1:52:47] THE LORD. YOU'RE HERE NOT BECAUSE
[1:52:49] SOMETHING YOU'VE DONE." HE SAID, "NO,
[1:52:51] YOU BELIEVE IN IT, SO YOU'RE HERE." HE
[1:52:53] SAID, "WHY ARE YOU HERE? ARE YOU HERE
[1:52:55] FOR CURIOSITY?" I DO NOT BELIEVE THAT A
[1:52:57] RIGHT-MINDED PERSON WOULD COME OUT ON A
[1:52:59] NIGHT LIKE THIS FOR CURIOSITY. ARE YOU
[1:53:01] COMING TO SHOW YOUR CLOTHES? NO, SIR. I
[1:53:04] believe that A PERSON WOULD DO THAT.
[1:53:06] COME OUT ON A NIGHT LIKE THIS TO SET
[1:53:07] EIGHT HOURS IN A TABERNACLE CONGESTED
[1:53:09] AND jammed together in one of the
[1:53:11] overflow crowds ALL OVER THE PLACE. YOU
[1:53:14] WOULDN'T DO IT FOR CURIOSITY OR TO SHOW
[1:53:16] CLOTHES. IT'S BECAUSE THAT SOMETHING IN
[1:53:19] you is leading you to do it.
[1:53:24] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:53:27] Finally, my brethren, whatsoever things
[1:53:29] are true, whatsoever things are pure,
[1:53:32] I've been preaching an hour and one
[1:53:33] minute. Whatsoever things are honest,
[1:53:36] whatsoever things are just, whatsoever
[1:53:38] things are pure, whatsoever things are
[1:53:40] lovely, whatsoever things are of a good
[1:53:42] report, if there be any virtue, if there
[1:53:45] be any praise, then think on these
[1:53:50] things.
[1:53:52] those things which you have both learned
[1:53:55] and received and heard and seen in me.
[1:54:00] Do and the God of peace shall be with
[1:54:04] you. Look at this word. Look at this
[1:54:06] word thank. It means to impute.
[1:54:10] &gt;&gt; Can I have just a few minutes here?
[1:54:11] &gt;&gt; It means to impute. It means to pass to
[1:54:15] one's account.
[1:54:17] &gt;&gt; Now, now this word actually deals with
[1:54:20] reality. this word think. If I think or
[1:54:25] reckon that my bank book has $25 in it,
[1:54:28] it has $25 in it. Otherwise, I am
[1:54:33] deceiving myself.
[1:54:35] &gt;&gt; This word refers to facts and not
[1:54:39] suppositions.
[1:54:41] &gt;&gt; You know what suppositions are? They're
[1:54:43] uncertain beliefs.
[1:54:45] &gt;&gt; There's no fact to them. There's no
[1:54:47] bottom to it. There's no foundation.
[1:54:49] It's just something that you just come
[1:54:50] up with and you think about and think
[1:54:52] about. But but look here what Paul says.
[1:54:54] He says in Romans 5:12, I want to give
[1:54:56] you a few things to think on. Okay? As
[1:54:58] by one man sin entered into the world
[1:55:00] and death by sin and so death passed
[1:55:03] upon all men, for that all have sinned.
[1:55:05] Look here in verse 14. Nevertheless,
[1:55:07] death reigned from Adam to Moses, even
[1:55:09] over them that had not sinned after the
[1:55:11] similitude of Adam's transgression, who
[1:55:14] is the figure of him that was to come.
[1:55:18] Now look here in verse 17. For if by one
[1:55:20] man's offense death reigned by one, much
[1:55:24] more they which receive abundance of
[1:55:26] grace and of the gift of righteousness
[1:55:29] shall reign in life by one Jesus Christ.
[1:55:34] You say, "Preacher, why are you saying
[1:55:35] that?" Because I want you all to hear
[1:55:37] this and I want you to hear it very
[1:55:38] plainly. This is God's program.
[1:55:42] &gt;&gt; There is a people on the earth today who
[1:55:44] is going to escape the tribulation.
[1:55:47] There is a people on the earth today who
[1:55:49] is going to escape a sinner's grave and
[1:55:52] a devil's hell. There is a people today
[1:55:54] on the earth who is going to escape the
[1:55:56] great plagues that are coming up. Are
[1:55:58] you hearing me? There is a PEOPLE YOU
[1:56:00] SAY THEN HOW DO I BECOME OF THAT PART OF
[1:56:02] THAT? ARE YOU READY FOR IT? HERE IT IS.
[1:56:04] GOD SPEAKS HIS WORD. GOD CONFIRMS THAT
[1:56:08] THE WORD AS BEING HIS WORD. GOD SPEAKS
[1:56:12] HIS WORD. THEN GOD CONFIRMS THAT WORD AS
[1:56:15] BEING HIS WORD. And then WE ARE
[1:56:18] RESPONSIBLE TO BELIEVE THAT WORD. AND IN
[1:56:21] THE SIMPLE ACT OF BELIEVING IT, GOD
[1:56:23] LOOKS DOWN AND SAYS, "YOU ARE
[1:56:26] [screaming] RIGHTEOUS."
[1:56:28] &gt;&gt; CHURCH OF THE LIVING GOD. AS YOU FOCUS
[1:56:31] ON THESE REVELATIONS, AS YOU CONCENTRATE
[1:56:34] ON THESE THINGS UNDER THAT THIRD POOL,
[1:56:36] GOD BEGINS TO DEPOSIT THE POWER.
[1:56:41] GLORY TO GOD. I FEEL LIKE DANCING. GOD
[1:56:43] BEGINS TO GLORY. HE BEGINS TO DEPOSIT
[1:56:47] THE POWER OF WHAT YOU'RE FOCUSING ON
[1:56:50] INTO YOUR ACCOUNT. COME ON, CHURCH.
[1:56:52] BROTHER SAID, "THERE WAS A MAN THE OTHER
[1:56:54] DAY WHO HAD A PSYCHIC MENTAL FAITH." AND
[1:56:57] BROTHER CARTER, HE SO CONCENTRATED ON A
[1:57:00] GLASS OF WATER UNTIL HIS NATURAL
[1:57:02] CONCENTRATION THROUGH A PHYSIC OR
[1:57:04] THROUGH A PSYCHIC MENTAL FAITH, BROTHER
[1:57:06] TOM, IT BROKE.
[1:57:09] ARE Y'ALL HEARING ME, BROTHER WESLEY?
[1:57:11] HE'S SO FOCUSED ON IT UNTIL HIS
[1:57:14] CONCENTRATION HAD THE POWER THROUGH A
[1:57:16] PSYCHIC MENTAL FAITH TO BREAK THAT GLASS
[1:57:19] AND THE WATER RAN OUT OF IT. BUT SAID,
[1:57:21] [laughter] "OH, OH, if a MAN CAN DO THAT
[1:57:25] BY A MENTAL THINKING, HE'S A FALLEN,
[1:57:28] PERVERTED CONDITION. WHAT IF THAT MAN
[1:57:30] CAN EVER GET BACK TO GOD?"
[1:57:34] [gasps]
[1:57:34] &gt;&gt; SISTER VANNA AND THE POWER OF GOD COME
[1:57:37] IN THERE. HE SAID, 'YOU KNOW WHAT'LL
[1:57:39] HAPPEN? HE SAID, 'LOOK, that spirit
[1:57:41] that's in a man could be converted and
[1:57:43] you put CHRIST IN THERE. WHO IS CHRIST?
[1:57:46] THE WORD. WHAT IS THE MESSAGE? CHRIST
[1:57:49] WHEN HE'S GOT A CONDUCTOR. AND LET A MAN
[1:57:52] WITH THAT SAME FAITH IN THE CONDUCTOR OF
[1:57:54] THE WORD OF GOD. He can raise the dead.
[1:57:57] &gt;&gt; He can cleanse the lepers. He can cast
[1:58:00] out devils. Listen, if a natural man by
[1:58:02] his psychic mental faith can concentrate
[1:58:05] and break a glass of water, what about
[1:58:08] the offspring of God?
[1:58:10] &gt;&gt; What about you that's been born again?
[1:58:13] &gt;&gt; What about you that's got more word in
[1:58:14] you than some people's ever heard in
[1:58:16] their entire life? Some of these young
[1:58:18] people sit here have heard more
[1:58:19] revelation in their life than than than
[1:58:22] theologians have heard in years of going
[1:58:23] to seminary. You say, "Why are you
[1:58:25] saying that?" Because what could happen
[1:58:27] if you would begin to focus, if you
[1:58:29] would begin to concentrate on the
[1:58:32] promises of God, with the faith, with a
[1:58:35] spiritual mind of that spiritual
[1:58:37] revealed truth. What if you would begin
[1:58:39] to focus on it and you were not looking
[1:58:40] at it and saying, "Is this the truth?
[1:58:44] &gt;&gt; Could this be [clears throat] the truth?
[1:58:46] Is this really about me? Am I really an
[1:58:48] overcomer? Am I really a part of this?
[1:58:51] Am I am I am I just am I just here
[1:58:53] because I'm married into it? or am I
[1:58:54] just a part of this because my my father
[1:58:56] was in it? Am I? No. If you could start
[1:58:59] concentrating on those things that's
[1:59:01] been revealed, can I tell you what'll
[1:59:02] happen to you? Can I tell you? YOU'LL
[1:59:04] BEGIN TO CRUSH that demon of guilt and
[1:59:06] condemnation.
[1:59:08] &gt;&gt; If you would begin TO FOCUS ON THE POWER
[1:59:10] OF THE BLOOD AND begin to focus on the
[1:59:12] revelations contained in those seven
[1:59:14] SEALS UNDER THAT THIRD PULL, LISTEN.
[1:59:16] COME ON, FOLKS. IT WASN'T UNDER THE
[1:59:18] FIRST PULL THAT THIS CAME. IT WASN'T
[1:59:20] UNDER THE SECOND PULL THAT THIS CAME,
[1:59:22] BUT UNDER THE THIRD PULL. ABRAHAM SAID
[1:59:24] LIKE THAT LITTLE ONE. Oh church, I'm out
[1:59:26] of time, but I got it ON MY HEART. IT'S
[1:59:28] LIKE THAT LITTLE WOMAN IN JOHN 4. YOU
[1:59:30] KNOW WHAT THE PRO OF GOD SAID? HE SAID
[1:59:31] SHE WAS WALKING AROUND ONE day and she
[1:59:33] was CONCENTRATING ON SOMETHING. YOU KNOW
[1:59:35] WHAT SHE WAS CONCENTRATING ON? BROTHER
[1:59:36] DAVID PAUL. HE SAID SHE WAS
[1:59:38] CONCENTRATING ON THIS. I'VE MESSED UP MY
[1:59:40] LIFE. I'VE BEEN MARRIED TO SIX MEN. I'M
[1:59:43] IN A HORRIBLE CONDITION. I'VE SENT MY
[1:59:45] DAY OF GRACE AWAY. SHE HE SAID, "OH
[1:59:47] YEAH, THAT'S WHAT SHE WAS THINKING
[1:59:48] ABOUT." SHE WAS CONCENTRATING ON THAT.
[1:59:51] HE SAID, "BUT THEN THERE WAS SOMETHING
[1:59:53] ELSE INSIDE OF HER." OH, GLORY TO GOD.
[1:59:56] THERE WAS SOMETHING ELSE INSIDE OF HER.
[1:59:58] IT WAS A SEED. AND HE SAID, "THEN THE
[2:00:00] SEED BEGAN TO SAY, BUT ONE DAY THE
[2:00:03] MESSIAH WILL COME AND SHE SAID ALL OF A
[2:00:06] SUDDEN SHE LOOKED AWAY TO JESUS AND SHE
[2:00:09] SAW THE MESSIAH." LISTEN. AND WHEN SHE
[2:00:12] BE TO FOCUS ON THE ATTRACTION OF THE
[2:00:15] FULFILLMENT OF THE WORD OF GOD, IT
[2:00:17] RELEASED THE POWER IN HER AND SHE BROKE
[2:00:19] THE DEMON OF GUILT. SHE BROKE THE DEMON
[2:00:22] OF CONDEMNATION. COME ON, GRACE
[2:00:24] TABERNACLE. WE'VE HAD A PROPHET IN THIS
[2:00:26] LAST DAY TO SAY THIS. YOU ARE STANDING
[2:00:29] COMPLETELY JUSTIFIED AS THOUGH YOU NEVER
[2:00:33] DID IT AT the beginning.
[2:00:36] WHERE WAS THAT LAYING UNDER THAT THIRD
[2:00:38] PULL? HALLELUJAH. You know what he says?
[2:00:42] He said, "This is my message
[2:00:44] &gt;&gt; to the church now. You are the pure,
[2:00:47] virtuous, sinless bride of the son of
[2:00:50] the living God. [clears throat]
[2:00:52] &gt;&gt; Let our musicians come. Every man and
[2:00:55] woman that's born of the spirit of God,
[2:00:58] washed in the blood of Jesus Christ,
[2:01:02] believes every word of God, stands. Are
[2:01:05] y'all ready for this? [sighs]
[2:01:08] &gt;&gt; I'm I'm talking to you. I've been I've
[2:01:11] been looking at some things.
[2:01:14] I've been concentrating [snorts]
[2:01:15] on some things, brother Matt. I've been
[2:01:17] I've been I've been focusing on what a
[2:01:19] prophet said. And this is what he said.
[2:01:22] He said, "Every man and woman and born
[2:01:23] the spirit of God." How many is born of
[2:01:26] the spirit of God? Can I see your hand?
[2:01:28] &gt;&gt; You've been washed in the blood of Jesus
[2:01:30] Christ. Can I see your hand?
[2:01:32] &gt;&gt; You believe every word of God.
[2:01:38] stand as though you never sinned
[2:01:43] &gt;&gt; at the first place.
[2:01:46] You are perfect
[2:01:52] if we can so concentrate on these things
[2:01:54] that's been revealed. [music] You know
[2:01:55] what a prophet of God said? He said
[2:01:58] these things will begin to transform
[2:01:59] your mortal body.
[2:02:03] Abraham said we're going to meet Jesus
[2:02:04] in the air before we get home.
[2:02:07] That's right. We're going to meet him in
[2:02:09] the air.
[2:02:12] He said, "We which are alive and remain
[2:02:13] shall not prevent or hinder those which
[2:02:14] are asleep." You know what he said? He
[2:02:16] said, "It's a perfect type of Rebecca."
[2:02:18] Rebraham said, "She jumped out of that
[2:02:20] out of that wagon. She met Elijah in the
[2:02:22] middle of the air." Met Isaac rather,
[2:02:24] sorry, Elijah letter to Isaac.
[2:02:28] Reb said, "We which are alive and remain
[2:02:30] shall be called up to meet the Lord in
[2:02:31] the air." He said, "Now therefore, now
[2:02:33] now can I say something to you? Where
[2:02:35] did revelation of theophony come? Under
[2:02:38] that third pool.
[2:02:40] Therefore, the theophony, [music]
[2:02:43] if you have died and entered into that
[2:02:46] theophony, what happens?
[2:02:50] The theophony comes to the earth [music]
[2:02:53] to pick up the redeemed body.
[2:02:56] And if you're here in the air, oh God,
[2:03:00] you take the body to meet the theophony.
[2:03:03] There you are and called up and go to
[2:03:07] meet the Lord.
[2:03:09] Oh little eaglet, maybe some little
[2:03:11] girl, some little boy or some old person
[2:03:14] or middle-aged. Why are you here this
[2:03:17] morning?
[2:03:19] You know what a prophet said? I love it.
[2:03:23] Because that
[2:03:25] you're really an eagle.
[2:03:28] [music]
[2:03:29] &gt;&gt; Won't you stand to your feet with us
[2:03:30] today?
[2:03:32] Why are you here this morning? [music]
[2:03:35] Because you really are an eagle.
[2:03:39] But maybe the cares of life has kind of
[2:03:41] battled you around roughly and you've
[2:03:43] lost sight. You're not too sure no more
[2:03:46] where you're placing your foot. Let's
[2:03:48] just come up against the rock now. Rocks
[2:03:50] of revelation, right? Oh, lead me to
[2:03:53] that rock that is higher than I. Let me
[2:03:57] lay on this rock.
[2:03:59] He's a shelter in a time of [music]
[2:04:01] storm. See, start beating against the
[2:04:05] door right now. Beating against the door
[2:04:06] of this rock. He'll open up. How many
[2:04:09] believes that the crust will fly off.
[2:04:13] [music] Then the pressure will leave you
[2:04:15] and you can be at rest again. Pressure
[2:04:17] all gone. You can come to church no
[2:04:20] matter what the pastor preaches about.
[2:04:22] Long as he [music] stays in the word of
[2:04:23] God, it'll never condemn you. You've
[2:04:25] done anchored in there. You're all right
[2:04:27] now.
[2:04:29] &gt;&gt; [music]
[2:04:29] &gt;&gt; Oh church,
[2:04:31] I don't know about you, but today I say
[2:04:32] Lord, I don't want to give my attention
[2:04:35] to no sideh shows.
[2:04:39] Lord, don't let anything desensitize me
[2:04:41] to this word.
[2:04:43] Lord, I don't want to I don't want to
[2:04:45] stop and ask him why you set up over
[2:04:46] here. Why you why you why you got all
[2:04:49] this? Why what what's so important about
[2:04:51] your protest? [music] No, I want to
[2:04:53] ignore it.
[2:04:54] &gt;&gt; I want to walk in there.
[2:04:57] Come on, church. I wonder, brother
[2:04:59] David, I wonder how many people have
[2:05:01] traveled across the world [music] and
[2:05:03] got down there to Memphis to see that
[2:05:04] museum and that site and walk by that
[2:05:07] lady and talk to her, let her let her
[2:05:08] tell them all the nonsense and stuff and
[2:05:10] get it in their minds. And then they go
[2:05:12] in there and they start seeing things
[2:05:13] and they can't really absorb it. They
[2:05:15] can't really look at it. They can't
[2:05:16] really engross themselves in it and read
[2:05:19] all the things because in their mind
[2:05:20] they're thinking about
[2:05:25] folks. I'm preaching to y'all. We may
[2:05:27] not be shouting, but we're preaching.
[2:05:31] How many How How many of you all say,
[2:05:32] "Lord, just [music] come by today and
[2:05:33] purge my mind."
[2:05:37] &gt;&gt; You know what I'm talking about. Purge
[2:05:39] my mind. [music] Lord, wash it today.
[2:05:43] Y'all, y'all y'all sometimes you get on
[2:05:45] them YouTube channels and start surfing
[2:05:48] around and hear some guy preaching
[2:05:49] against the moving of God. Sideshow.
[2:05:52] [music]
[2:05:53] &gt;&gt; It's a sideshow.
[2:05:54] &gt;&gt; It's a protest.
[2:05:56] &gt;&gt; Hear some man get up and start preaching
[2:05:58] against the move of God. And then you
[2:05:59] come down here to Grace Tabernacle where
[2:06:00] we believe in the move of God.
[2:06:02] &gt;&gt; And we believe in shouting and dancing
[2:06:04] and rejoicing and the power of God
[2:06:06] starts falling and some raise up in your
[2:06:07] mind and you start
[2:06:12] &gt;&gt; Jesus.
[2:06:14] &gt;&gt; See maybe somebody come by and brother
[2:06:17] told me one time he said you know I'm
[2:06:20] I'm going to tell something here a
[2:06:21] little bit. I'm not going to tell too
[2:06:22] much but I'm going to tell enough
[2:06:23] [music] of it. He said you know he said
[2:06:25] somebody told me something. He said
[2:06:26] about that church down there y'all's
[2:06:28] church. Grace Tabernacle. He said, "You
[2:06:30] know, I listened to it." And he said, "I
[2:06:32] believed it." He said, "I really didn't
[2:06:33] know." He said, "But then I just come
[2:06:35] and sing for myself."
[2:06:40] Goes to this church. Said, "Then I come
[2:06:42] and sing for myself." And said, "Now I
[2:06:45] know what's going on in there."
[2:06:47] &gt;&gt; See, you got to get your eyes off the
[2:06:49] sideh shows.
[2:06:51] &gt;&gt; This is a third pull church. [music]
[2:06:53] &gt;&gt; This is a word church.
[2:06:54] &gt;&gt; We're not focusing on everything around
[2:06:56] the protest. We're focusing on the
[2:06:58] message.
[2:07:00] &gt;&gt; We're going to concentrate on it till we
[2:07:02] can stand here and preach it so
[2:07:03] authoratively to you that you'll break
[2:07:05] every demon of condemnation.
[2:07:12] &gt;&gt; Take anything you want to from us, but
[2:07:14] don't take that message.
[2:07:17] &gt;&gt; And I'm going to tell you something. I'm
[2:07:19] going to tell you something this
[2:07:20] morning. In the name of the Lord, any
[2:07:22] devil starts telling you that the house
[2:07:23] of God ain't important, it's a lying
[2:07:25] spirit. Yes,
[2:07:28] &gt;&gt; you can call it what you want to. It's a
[2:07:29] devil trying to [music] protest the move
[2:07:31] of God.
[2:07:32] &gt;&gt; And you're looking at one preacher
[2:07:33] that's not ashamed to say it's a devil.
[2:07:36] &gt;&gt; Ain't no time for these sideh [music]
[2:07:37] shows. There's a rapture coming.
[2:07:40] &gt;&gt; There's a body change coming.
[2:07:44] There's a resurrection coming. And
[2:07:46] there's something in it pertaining to
[2:07:47] you.
[2:07:48] &gt;&gt; If the devil's trying to knock you out,
[2:07:50] it's because he knows there's something
[2:07:51] in it pertaining to you.
[2:07:53] &gt;&gt; Stand your ground.
[2:07:57] Jesus ain't got no time for sideshows.
[2:08:00] Brother David,
[2:08:02] &gt;&gt; I'm concentrated.
[2:08:04] &gt;&gt; How many bow your hearts with me this
[2:08:05] morning? Just [music] raise your hand.
[2:08:06] Say, "Lord, I ain't got no more time for
[2:08:09] sideshows.
[2:08:10] I don't have time for people's hurts and
[2:08:13] people's feelings and people's ideas. I
[2:08:16] don't have time to give my attention to
[2:08:18] that." Compassionate, yes. Loving, yes.
[2:08:22] Caring, yes. But Lord, I wonder how many
[2:08:25] in here today would say, 'Lord, give me
[2:08:27] that spiritual discernment.
[2:08:29] Lord, give me that spiritual discernment
[2:08:32] to discern between whether it's a it's a
[2:08:34] need or it's a spiritual protest.
[2:08:37] [music] Lord, would you give me that
[2:08:38] discernment when I talk to people
[2:08:42] that they begin to tell me things? Maybe
[2:08:44] maybe somebody begins to tell you
[2:08:45] something about the message. Say, Lord,
[2:08:47] give me that spiritual discernment to
[2:08:49] pick up. It's a spiritual protest.
[2:08:52] It's somebody that's trying to do
[2:08:53] something to stop the faith.
[2:08:57] Maybe you're sitting here today and
[2:08:59] friendships, relationships are are
[2:09:01] becoming strained because of different
[2:09:03] directions and paths ones [music] have
[2:09:04] taken. But you say today, Lord, I want I
[2:09:07] want confidence and grace in my heart to
[2:09:10] stand on my convictions.
[2:09:13] I don't I don't want to waver. I don't
[2:09:15] want to bow.
[2:09:17] I want to stand. God bless you there.
[2:09:20] God bless you.
[2:09:23] I ask you [music] this morning as the
[2:09:24] spirit of the Lord's moving and every
[2:09:25] heart is bowed right now. Hands up all
[2:09:27] over the building. God bless you. He
[2:09:29] sees your hands up there, brother. He
[2:09:30] sees your hands. I want to ask you right
[2:09:33] now, would you say, Lord, come by my way
[2:09:35] and purge my mind right now. Purge my
[2:09:39] mind. I want to leave this service today
[2:09:41] with a renewed mind. I want a renewed
[2:09:44] mind of the assembly. I want a renewed
[2:09:46] mind of my brother. I want a renewed
[2:09:48] mind towards my sister. Maybe the devil
[2:09:51] been trying to plant something in your
[2:09:52] mind against the ministry. You say,
[2:09:54] "Lord, I want a renewed mind today."
[2:09:57] Maybe a husband and a wife, the devil's
[2:09:59] trying to trying to get between you or a
[2:10:01] family or relationships there. And you
[2:10:02] say, "Today, Lord, I want a renewed
[2:10:04] mind. [music] Lord, I want the spiritual
[2:10:06] mind. I want the mind that has the
[2:10:09] ability to discern whether this is good
[2:10:10] or evil."
[2:10:12] Almighty God, we bow our hearts in your
[2:10:14] presence today, Lord. Father, these are
[2:10:17] your eagles. Lord, these are your
[2:10:19] children. And Lord, your spirit is here
[2:10:22] among us. Your spirit is here. And Lord,
[2:10:25] though there may be heavy hearts, though
[2:10:28] there may be though there may be torn
[2:10:30] spirits, Lord, Father, we're standing
[2:10:33] here today upon the confidence of
[2:10:36] knowing that this message is the
[2:10:38] attraction. Lord, it's the it's the
[2:10:41] drawing power. It's you fulfilling your
[2:10:44] word. Now, Lord, I pray for every one of
[2:10:46] my brothers and sisters. I raise my hand
[2:10:49] today with them, dear God. Though I've
[2:10:51] stood here and labored and delivered
[2:10:53] these things you put up on my heart.
[2:10:55] Lord, I want to leave here with a
[2:10:56] renewed mind. Lord, I want a renewed
[2:10:59] mind. Lord, I don't want to give any
[2:11:01] attention to little sideesh shows. Lord,
[2:11:04] I don't want to I don't want to give any
[2:11:05] attention to little protests. Lord,
[2:11:07] [music] Father, I want to give my whole
[2:11:09] attention to this word, Lord. I want to
[2:11:12] be like your prophet. I I want to give
[2:11:14] everything I am to this third pull.
[2:11:16] Lord, I want to give my my strength. I
[2:11:18] want to give my efforts to it. Lord,
[2:11:20] every everything I can do, everything I
[2:11:23] can say, Lord, I want to give it under
[2:11:25] this third pull. [music]
[2:11:26] Father, your spirit is here today. Lord,
[2:11:30] maybe there's a person sitting here
[2:11:31] today and your word is spoke to them.
[2:11:34] Maybe they've stopped and asked, "Why
[2:11:37] are you set up here? What's your
[2:11:39] purpose? What's your what's your issue?
[2:11:41] What's your protest? And Lord, maybe
[2:11:43] somebody has sold to them their issues.
[2:11:47] And now, Lord, they're holding on to
[2:11:49] those issues. And now, Father, things
[2:11:51] are desensitizing them. Lord, little
[2:11:54] words, little little jokes, little
[2:11:57] little things, oh God, that should
[2:11:58] should not be in our fellowship have
[2:12:01] begun to desensitize.
[2:12:03] Oh, I'm asking you today, dear God. Come
[2:12:06] by our way today, Lord. Shake us,
[2:12:09] Father.
[2:12:11] renew our sensitivity to your word.
[2:12:15] Oh, I wonder today how many could raise
[2:12:17] your hands. Oh, you could raise your
[2:12:19] hands right now and say, "Lord, Lord,
[2:12:22] come by my way today.
[2:12:24] Lord, I've I've I've let I've let some
[2:12:27] little something get in my mind. I've
[2:12:29] let that become the leadership. I've let
[2:12:32] that become the thing by which I make my
[2:12:34] decisions."
[2:12:35] Maybe you've let something come in your
[2:12:36] mind and you've let that become the
[2:12:38] hindrance between you and worship and
[2:12:39] God in the services and you're ready
[2:12:42] today to say, "Lord,
[2:12:44] take it away. I want a new mind, Lord."
[2:12:48] Spiritually concentrated.
[2:12:51] Spiritually concentrated.
[2:12:55] Hallelujah.
[2:12:57] Hallelujah.
[2:13:01] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:13:03] Not pass.
[2:13:14] Oh come
[2:13:18] in our
[2:13:20] oh gentle
[2:13:22] gentle savior
[2:13:26] Savior.
[2:13:28] [music]
[2:13:30] Oh, he you say, "Lord, come by my way
[2:13:33] today."
[2:13:36] &gt;&gt; Humble.
[2:13:39] [music]
[2:13:45] I
[2:13:47] [music]
[2:13:49] mother
[2:13:53] I call
[2:14:00] to
[2:14:03] not pass
[2:14:06] me.
[2:14:10] Oh yes. [music]
[2:14:14] Crying
[2:14:16] save.
[2:14:20] &gt;&gt; Is that your cry [music] today?
[2:14:23] Oh,
[2:14:27] &gt;&gt; oh yes.
[2:14:30] Hear [music]
[2:14:32] my
[2:14:34] heart
[2:14:38] [music] cry.
[2:14:45] And while
[2:14:50] [music]
[2:14:51] there's thou
[2:14:53] art come,
[2:14:58] is that your prayer today?
[2:15:00] Oh, do you
[2:15:04] not pass
[2:15:06] me
[2:15:08] by?
[2:15:12] As I play that softly, just before we
[2:15:14] turn the service to brother Matt, I want
[2:15:15] to say something to you.
[2:15:17] You know, you can go through things and
[2:15:20] you can go through situations
[2:15:23] and things can happen
[2:15:25] and you can get a resistance built up in
[2:15:28] your heart
[2:15:30] and really really what you're what
[2:15:33] you're offended at is the wrong thing.
[2:15:35] Y'all know that. You probably heard me
[2:15:38] tell it before, but I was preaching over
[2:15:39] at brother Josh [music] Bennett one time
[2:15:41] and I got to dealing with offenses and
[2:15:42] how people get offended and things
[2:15:44] happen and situations. And I said it's
[2:15:46] like people they get offended at this
[2:15:48] message because some [music] man said
[2:15:50] something or some man taught something
[2:15:52] and rather than bringing a grace upon
[2:15:53] their heart, it brought a bondage or or
[2:15:55] or a legalism. And when I said that,
[2:15:58] there was a lady sitting about where you
[2:15:59] are, Sophie. She's sitting over there
[2:16:00] and she just raised her hands, sister,
[2:16:02] older sister, and just started praising
[2:16:04] God. And I noticed that struck her and
[2:16:06] she come to me after service. She said,
[2:16:07] 'But Andrew," she said, 'I've been I've
[2:16:09] been in church for years in the message.
[2:16:12] She said, 'But the past 26 years, she
[2:16:13] said, 'I've been going to church. She
[2:16:15] said, but I have been so bothered when
[2:16:18] somebody starts talking about the
[2:16:20] message and talking about that prophet.
[2:16:22] [music] So, she said, I just just been
[2:16:24] so offended. I said, Lord, what's going
[2:16:26] on? is she said 26 years ago she said a
[2:16:30] man took a sermon built some quotes and
[2:16:32] preached that whole sermon right there
[2:16:34] at me and said it so offended me said I
[2:16:37] just got offended the message and she
[2:16:39] said but this morning when you took time
[2:16:41] and showed there's a difference in the
[2:16:42] message and what a [music] man does with
[2:16:44] the message she said there was a grace
[2:16:46] just come over my heart
[2:16:48] &gt;&gt; and she said I'm done resent it
[2:16:51] &gt;&gt; she said I can't wait to get back in
[2:16:53] church I can't wait to hear it again you
[2:16:55] See, that's that's the power of
[2:16:58] concentrating on this message. Listen,
[2:17:00] I've said it to you before and I'll say
[2:17:02] it again. I will not preach the word of
[2:17:05] God to beat a person.
[2:17:08] &gt;&gt; But I will preach the word of God to
[2:17:10] beat the fire out of the spirit.
[2:17:14] &gt;&gt; Cuz it's the spirit.
[2:17:16] &gt;&gt; It's not the person. And if the spirit
[2:17:18] ever gets broken and the person begins
[2:17:21] to get up out from underneath the
[2:17:22] leadership of that spirit
[2:17:24] &gt;&gt; and they begin to see there really is
[2:17:26] something going on.
[2:17:27] &gt;&gt; This is more than noise. This is more
[2:17:30] than building a church. This is more
[2:17:31] than just gathering twice a week. But
[2:17:33] this is a revival. [music]
[2:17:35] &gt;&gt; Oh, what a joy will come in your heart.
[2:17:38] Do you love him today?
[2:17:40] &gt;&gt; We say God bless you all. Thank you for
[2:17:42] being here this morning. Pray for us the
[2:17:44] meeting this afternoon. Amen. come if
[2:17:46] you can and tend it and support it and
[2:17:48] get behind the young people. Amen. We're
[2:17:50] doing these to to press forward. We're
[2:17:53] moving forward. Amen. [music] You love
[2:17:55] him this morning. Amen. I say thank God
[2:17:57] there's there's a few churches left in
[2:17:59] the land today that's preaching this
[2:18:02] message and building the hearts of the
[2:18:04] people in this message and not in
[2:18:07] themselves.
[2:18:08] Oh church, we ought to raise our hands
[2:18:10] right now and say, "Lord, thank you.
[2:18:12] &gt;&gt; Thank you." Brother Matt, would you
[2:18:14] come? God bless you friends. Remember in
[2:18:17] prayer we'll be leaving Lord willing
[2:18:18] tomorrow for New Zealand. We'll be gone
[2:18:20] for a week. So those of you that just
[2:18:23] remembers in prayer, we love you all
[2:18:25] with the love of the Lord. God bless you
[2:18:26] this evening, this morning rather.
[2:18:30] Won't
[2:18:33] [singing] you be [music]
[2:18:36] my
[2:18:41] friend?
[2:18:45] [music]
[2:18:47] Oh, and while
[2:18:52] all [music] others
[2:18:54] [singing]
[2:18:56] are calling,
[2:19:00] [music]
[2:19:03] do
[2:19:06] not [music] pass
[2:19:10] me by.
[2:19:16] Amen. You love the Lord this morning.
[2:19:19] &gt;&gt; Amen. How many say that the Lord spoke
[2:19:21] to your heart?
[2:19:22] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:19:23] &gt;&gt; There's a difference between the message
[2:19:25] and what a man does with the message.
[2:19:27] Isn't that the truth? Amen. We have a
[2:19:29] reality that God has given us in this
[2:19:33] hour. I'm just so thankful that [music]
[2:19:35] he's given us a light to navigate the
[2:19:38] word of God. Amen. That way we can
[2:19:41] rightly divide [music] the word of
[2:19:42] truth. Amen. And God has given us a
[2:19:45] light in this in this end [music] time
[2:19:47] to be able to do just that. Amen. I I I
[2:19:50] it's just a sad thought to wander in
[2:19:52] darkness [music] and look through the
[2:19:54] scriptures and not not not know what you
[2:19:57] was reading and not have an
[2:19:58] understanding, a spiritual
[2:20:00] understanding. [music] And what a a sad
[2:20:02] place to be able to be. But I thank God
[2:20:04] that he's given us a light. And that
[2:20:06] light that's that's how we discern if
[2:20:09] we're being led of God or not is by the
[2:20:11] light of his word. It's not by our
[2:20:13] feelings and emotions as our brother was
[2:20:16] speaking. Amen. [music] But God has
[2:20:18] given us a true discernment of the word
[2:20:20] of God. Amen. I'm just so thankful for
[2:20:23] what God is doing for us. And I really
[2:20:26] enjoyed that message. Enjoyed what
[2:20:28] [music] brother Andrew had to say. And
[2:20:31] you know, he was telling that story or
[2:20:33] telling you about the the the protester.
[2:20:36] &gt;&gt; [music]
[2:20:36] &gt;&gt; You know, I I noticed something about uh
[2:20:39] about that lady whenever we went by is
[2:20:42] that she [music] was on where she was
[2:20:44] sitting and I walked by and said, "Why?
[2:20:47] Why are y'all Why are y'all here?"
[2:20:49] "Well, it's because I can't be there."
[2:20:52] That was their answer. So, I come to as
[2:20:54] close to the border of it as I can so
[2:20:57] that everybody that walks onto this
[2:20:58] property, I can tell them not to go on
[2:21:00] it. I thought, "What a motive." Really,
[2:21:03] she was a squatter. She [music] was just
[2:21:05] living in a building that they wanted to
[2:21:06] do something with and they made her move
[2:21:08] out of it in order that they could make
[2:21:10] a museum out of it and she had been
[2:21:12] living there free for a while and they
[2:21:14] kicked all them people out and took them
[2:21:17] somewhere else. But I thought what a
[2:21:19] thing for a person to do is to sit right
[2:21:22] on the border
[2:21:23] &gt;&gt; to keep anybody that would enter in from
[2:21:26] being able to enter in
[2:21:27] &gt;&gt; with a clear conscience or a clear mind.
[2:21:30] Thought isn't that what the devil does?
[2:21:32] I'm going to get I can't enter in there.
[2:21:33] So, I'm going to get so close to the
[2:21:35] border of it as I can so that anybody
[2:21:37] that would cross across them borders,
[2:21:38] [music] I could discourage them from
[2:21:40] entering in. That's exactly what the
[2:21:42] devil does. Amen. I'm not calling the
[2:21:45] lady a devil. I don't know her. But I'm
[2:21:47] just talking about from a spiritual
[2:21:48] stand. That's what he does is to stop us
[2:21:51] from entering in. Friends, let me tell
[2:21:53] you. Let me tell you what that's that's
[2:21:55] called in the military. It's called an
[2:21:56] ambush. You don't go there with the
[2:21:59] intention. you're you're going for a
[2:22:00] prize or going for a goal and there's
[2:22:03] something laying in weight that you
[2:22:04] didn't know was there to catch you off
[2:22:07] guard or to catch you blindsided. But
[2:22:10] friends, I don't I don't think that we
[2:22:11] have to be blindsided by the devil
[2:22:13] &gt;&gt; because we have a word that shows us
[2:22:16] that [music] exposes where he is. That's
[2:22:18] why we listen to the preaching of the
[2:22:20] word of God where the market opens it.
[2:22:22] It even it corrects [music] our
[2:22:24] thoughts. The day you get to a place
[2:22:25] where God can't correct you, you will
[2:22:27] never be able to move any further with
[2:22:29] God.
[2:22:30] &gt;&gt; You get so spiritual that now you lead
[2:22:32] God and all the you you you you become
[2:22:35] the answer. You become the uh the the
[2:22:37] one that discerns everybody's rights and
[2:22:39] wrongs. You'll never move any further
[2:22:41] with God until you go back to that place
[2:22:43] and say, "I don't know nothing.
[2:22:45] &gt;&gt; I don't know one thing, and I want God
[2:22:47] to lead me.
[2:22:49] &gt;&gt; I don't know what's going on. I want God
[2:22:50] to lead me by the word of God. I don't
[2:22:52] I'm not the one that's right. But I'm
[2:22:54] not the big man. I'm not the big woman.
[2:22:56] Amen. I'm just a child of God that wants
[2:22:58] to be led of God and be a help to
[2:23:00] somebody that's hurting. If you see
[2:23:01] hurt, get a burden on your heart to help
[2:23:03] the hurt. That's what a real daughter of
[2:23:05] God does.
[2:23:06] &gt;&gt; She sees somebody in trouble. She don't
[2:23:09] persecute and ridicule and well, look
[2:23:11] how terrible they are and how how messed
[2:23:13] they are and why what a mess this is.
[2:23:15] No. A real daughter of God gets a burden
[2:23:17] on her heart to go correct and help and
[2:23:19] and lead and be an example and be a
[2:23:22] helping hand and lift somebody up. Amen.
[2:23:26] And they stay the course. They stay in
[2:23:28] the fight. Amen. That's a true son and
[2:23:32] true daughter of God. If your children
[2:23:33] in trouble, Brother David Paul, you
[2:23:35] wouldn't run from the fight.
[2:23:37] No. You know what he would do? He'd
[2:23:39] fight everybody in [music] the way. It
[2:23:42] wouldn't matter how big or little they
[2:23:43] were. If that little guy was in trouble,
[2:23:45] he'd stand out there in the middle of
[2:23:46] the road, cars coming, wouldn't matter
[2:23:48] because he has a burden on his heart for
[2:23:50] his son. [music] And friends, that's
[2:23:52] what you really need. You need a burden
[2:23:54] for other people
[2:23:55] &gt;&gt; and not yourself. No, so selfish. I
[2:23:57] didn't get this out of it. I'm not
[2:23:58] getting this. I'm not getting growth.
[2:24:00] I'm not getting answers. I'm not getting
[2:24:01] this. We're so selfish
[2:24:03] &gt;&gt; that we've lost our burden for everybody
[2:24:05] else. But if you can approach this
[2:24:07] gospel with a burden on your heart to do
[2:24:08] something for somebody else, [music] it
[2:24:10] ain't about you no more. Then God can
[2:24:12] really use you.
[2:24:13] &gt;&gt; Brother Brian, is that the truth?
[2:24:16] &gt;&gt; Brother Tom, is that the truth? Brother
[2:24:18] David, is that the truth? God bless you,
[2:24:20] elders. It's the truth that having a
[2:24:24] burden for other people is the only
[2:24:27] place that God can ever use you.
[2:24:29] &gt;&gt; I pray God give us a real burden for one
[2:24:31] another.
[2:24:32] &gt;&gt; Amen. They can use us to help one
[2:24:34] another grow. Amen. [music] We're I
[2:24:36] believe what brother Andrew said. We're
[2:24:38] going in a rapture and the devil's doing
[2:24:40] everything he can to fight us from it.
[2:24:43] Amen. But I thank God that I'm a part of
[2:24:45] a work of the Holy Ghost. A small part.
[2:24:47] I'm not much of it. Amen. I'm the
[2:24:50] littlest one. Small part, but I thank
[2:24:52] God that he he allows us to be led by
[2:24:55] the Holy Spirit. Amen. You love the Lord
[2:24:58] this morning.
[2:24:59] &gt;&gt; Amen. We just [music] certainly looking
[2:25:01] forward to the service this evening with
[2:25:04] our young people. Amen. just just to see
[2:25:07] what God has in store. And and I know
[2:25:10] several of these young men that that God
[2:25:13] has been dealing with and and we just
[2:25:17] want to have an opportunity [music] uh
[2:25:19] tonight that we can just grow and maybe
[2:25:22] we can have more youth services. We we
[2:25:25] just had it on our heart to do this uh
[2:25:27] [music] this evening and to see what the
[2:25:29] Lord has in store. So we just want to
[2:25:31] invite everybody uh to come, you elders
[2:25:34] that can come and be a support. We
[2:25:35] certainly encourage you uh to do that
[2:25:38] this evening. Let's just as Brother
[2:25:40] Brian, would you come and close us in a
[2:25:42] word of prayer?
[2:25:55] Most gracious heavenly father, Lord, we
[2:25:57] come before you, Father. Lord, you fed
[2:26:00] us, Lord.
[2:26:01] Lord, you've encouraged us, Lord Jesus,
[2:26:04] to stand, Lord God, in your word.
[2:26:08] Lord, your word is our absolute, Lord,
[2:26:11] and you've given us a place to stand on
[2:26:13] it, Lord. Father, you called us. You
[2:26:16] didn't call everyone to this, Lord. And
[2:26:18] we're so thankful, Lord, that you've
[2:26:20] given us eyes to see and you've given us
[2:26:22] ears to hear, Lord. Father, you chasten
[2:26:25] us, Lord. Father, that we would stay in
[2:26:28] step with every word that could be
[2:26:31] spoken, Lord. Lord, these young people,
[2:26:34] Lord Jesus, as we gather tonight, Lord,
[2:26:37] Lord, these young people are coming up,
[2:26:39] Lord God, as Brother Andrew said, how
[2:26:42] Lord, they've heard more revelation than
[2:26:44] most theologians
[2:26:46] because they've been taught the truth of
[2:26:49] this word, Lord, the importance of this
[2:26:51] gospel, Lord. Father, without this
[2:26:54] gospel, how could we understand, Lord?
[2:26:56] Without your prophet, how could we ever
[2:26:58] know, Lord, where we stand in you? Lord,
[2:27:01] I ask you that you would bless these
[2:27:03] young people, Lord. God, that you would
[2:27:06] illuminate their mind with a revelation
[2:27:08] of this word like never before, Lord.
[2:27:11] Lord, that when the enemy comes in,
[2:27:13] Lord, they'll be able to stand, Lord.
[2:27:16] Father, I ask you these things, Lord,
[2:27:18] [music]
[2:27:18] be with Brother Andrew and strengthen
[2:27:20] him for tonight's service, Lord. Lord
[2:27:23] God, and I pray that you draw all those
[2:27:25] that you want to be here to be here
[2:27:27] tonight, Lord. Father God, that we could
[2:27:29] be found before your table, Lord. Lord,
[2:27:32] we declare it for young people, Lord.
[2:27:35] [music] But it's your word unto us all,
[2:27:36] Lord. But I pray, oh Lord God, that you
[2:27:39] would bless the young people beyond the
[2:27:41] boundaries of their heart, Lord. Father,
[2:27:44] and bless our pastor, Lord, and his and
[2:27:46] his dear wife, Lord Jesus, as they stand
[2:27:48] in the gap for this congregation, Lord.
[2:27:51] Father, I ask you these things in the
[2:27:53] name of the Lord Jesus Christ. Amen.
[2:27:59] &gt;&gt; About the [singing and music] Lord,
[2:28:02] how he saved me, how he [music] raised
[2:28:06] me, how he filled me with the [singing]
[2:28:09] Holy Ghost. How he knew [music] me to
[2:28:14] the uttermost.
[2:28:15] When I think about the road,
[2:28:20] help me pick me up. Turn me around.

[2:28:25] feet

[2:28:40] all the glory,
[2:28:43] all the honor, all of my praise.
[2:28:47] It makes [singing] me want to shout.
[2:28:51] Hallelujah. [music]
[2:28:53] Thank you, Jesus.
[2:28:55] Lord, you're worthy of all the glory,
[2:28:59] all of the [music and singing] honor,
[2:29:01] all of my praise. God bless you this
[2:29:04] morning. For when I think about the
[2:29:08] Lord,
[2:29:10] how he saved [music and singing]
[2:29:11] me, how he praised me, how he filled me
[2:29:16] with the Holy [music] Ghost, how he
[2:29:19] healed me to the uttermost when I
[2:29:23] [music] think about the Lord.
[2:29:26] How you pick me up and turn me around.
[2:29:30] [music]
[2:29:30] How you cross my feet.
[2:29:34] Solid ground.
[2:29:37] It makes me want to shout.
[2:29:39] [music and singing]
[2:29:41] Hallelujah.
[2:29:42] Thank you, Jesus. [music] Lord, you're
[2:29:45] worthy [singing] of all the glory,
[2:29:49] all the honor, all of my praise. [music]
