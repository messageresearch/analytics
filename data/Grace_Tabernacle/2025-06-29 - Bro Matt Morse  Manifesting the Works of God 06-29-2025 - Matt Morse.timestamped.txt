[6:27] [Music]
[6:57] Between an army and the sea, it must
[7:02] have felt forsaken waring why God wasn't
[7:08] all he said he
[7:12] Oh, when your backs against the wall.
[7:17] Oh, that's the hardest place of all.
[7:22] Oh, somewhere between
[7:27] and Oh, let's all stand and sing that
[7:30] chorus now.
[7:32] Oh, God
[7:35] will make a way
[7:40] when there seems to be no way.
[7:45] Oh, forever. He is faithful
[7:50] and he
[7:52] will mar.
[7:57] Oh, when you bear a heavy load,
[8:02] I know
[8:05] my God will make way.
[8:12] And when a wall of circumstances
[8:17] leaves you crying in the night
[8:22] and you struggle till your strength is
[8:26] almost gone.
[8:29] Oh God will gently hold you in. the
[8:35] shelter of his heart.
[8:39] And he'll carve a road for you to carry
[8:44] on.
[8:47] I know my God.
[8:51] He'll make a way
[8:56] when there seems to be no way.
[9:01] who forever. He is faithful
[9:06] and he
[9:08] will make a road
[9:13] when you bear a heavy load.
[9:18] Oh, I know
[9:20] my God will make a way.
[9:25] Oh, aren't you thankful for that this
[9:27] evening? No matter what you're going
[9:29] through, whatever you're facing, we know
[9:31] we have a savior and a maker that will
[9:33] make a way when there seems to be no
[9:34] way. Certainly good to be in the house
[9:36] of the Lord this morning. I know we got
[9:39] some out. Brother Joe's out in Georgia
[9:41] ministering. I believe Brother Andrew is
[9:43] still out in Florida ministering as
[9:44] well. So, just remember those brothers
[9:46] and we got some out sick. So, Brother
[9:48] Travis, will you open the service in a
[9:49] word of prayer?
[9:52] [Music]
[10:12] Oh, and the more that I
[10:16] surrender,
[10:19] hold the lier,
[10:21] my lord.
[10:24] Oh, the more that I release my cares.
[10:29] Oh, the more you take control.
[10:34] Oh, the more that I can humble myself,
[10:39] the more you lift me up. Oh, every day I
[10:45] live.
[10:47] Lord, I love. Oh, let's sing that first
[10:50] verse now.
[10:53] Oh, it gets easier
[10:57] to understand
[10:59] this road. I'm traveling down.
[11:04] No more wave
[11:07] or wondering.
[11:09] I'm standing on solid ground.
[11:13] Oh, and I know I'm heading to my future
[11:18] home. And the voice I hear is yours
[11:22] alone. Every day I live.
[11:27] Lord, I love you more.
[11:33] And the more that I surrender.
[11:38] Oh, the louder
[11:41] my Lord.
[11:43] And the more that I release my cares,
[11:49] the more you take control.
[11:53] And the more that I can humble myself,
[11:58] the more you lift me up. Oh, every day I
[12:05] live,
[12:06] Lord, I love you more.
[12:12] Oh, and the problems I had on yesterday
[12:18] are stepping stones to a higher place.
[12:23] The trials that seem so awesome to me
[12:28] are now my patterns of victory.
[12:33] And I know I'm headed to my future home.
[12:38] And the voice I hear is yours alone.
[12:43] Every day I live. Oh Lord, I love you,
[12:48] Lord.
[12:52] Oh, the more that I surrender.
[12:57] Oh, the lighter
[13:00] my Lord.
[13:02] Oh, the more that I
[13:06] Yes. Oh, the more you take control
[13:12] and the more that I can humble myself,
[13:17] the more you lift me up. Oh, every day I
[13:23] live, oh Lord. Oh, sing that chorus once
[13:27] more to him. If you have a need, just
[13:29] lift it to him now. For the more that I
[13:36] Oh, and the lighter
[13:39] my Lord.
[13:41] Oh, the more that I release my cares,
[13:47] the more you take control,
[13:51] and the more that I can humble myself,
[13:57] the more you lift me up. Oh, every day I
[14:03] live.
[14:04] Lord, I love you more.

[14:10] we could take our burdens and our cares?

[23:15] [Music]
[23:34] You brought me
[23:36] through sorrow
[23:38] and pain.
[23:41] You were there
[23:43] every time that I called.
[23:51] You reached down
[23:53] and lifted me
[23:56] out of sin and shame.
[24:00] But tonight, Lord,
[24:03] just let me fall.
[24:10] Let me fall
[24:13] in love with you all over
[24:17] again.
[24:19] Let me know you

[24:50] Well, I walked
[24:52] through the winter,
[24:55] felt death coldest

[25:02] brought strength to stand home.
[25:09] over too long
[25:12] a summer
[25:15] without any rain.
[25:19] Oh, what's left, Lord?
[25:22] But to have a great fall.

[26:09] Well, I walked
[26:12] through the winter,
[26:15] felt this coldest
[26:17] steam,
[26:19] but the spring time brought strength to
[26:24] stand tall.
[26:29] Over too long
[26:32] a summer

[28:21] Even though my My spirit is low and it
[28:26] seems I can hardly go, but still
[28:30] I see victory.
[28:37] Many times I'm walking by faith. I can't
[28:41] see what lies before me, but still I see
[28:46] victory.
[28:51] I just got to tell you, Satan, you can't
[28:56] cross the bloodline
[28:59] because I'm covered by his blood.
[29:05] Well, you may stare and you may fight,
[29:09] but you're going to lose this battle
[29:12] tonight. Remember,
[29:15] you can't cross the blood line.
[29:21] Many times our battles get hot and it
[29:25] seems like we're fighting a lot. Oh, I
[29:29] remember standing on the rock.
[29:35] So, Satan, if I were you, I turn around
[29:40] and I give up to do believe you're bound
[29:46] to lose.

[30:23] seems like we're fighting a lot. Oh, I

[30:34] So, Satan, if I were you, I turn around

[31:07] tonight. Remember,

[31:16] Many times our battles get hard.
[31:20] Seems like we're fighting a lot. Oh,
[31:23] aren't you thankful you know where
[31:24] you're standing this morning?
[31:29] [Music]
[31:30] So Satan, if I were you. Oh, just tell
[31:34] him this morning
[31:36] cuz I do believe you're bound to lose.
[31:41] Oh, sing it now. Oh, I just got to tell
[31:46] you, Satan, you can't cross the
[31:49] bloodline
[31:52] because I'm covered by his blood.

[32:11] Oh, just remember
[32:15] can't cross the bloodline.
[32:20] [Music]
[32:23] Praise the Lord this morning,
[32:26] man. He may afflict our flesh. He may do
[32:29] a lot of things, Brother Tom, but he
[32:30] ain't going to cross the bloodline.
[32:32] Amen. How many times have you heard
[32:33] Brother Brown praying? He'd say, "Lord,
[32:35] I plead the blood of Jesus Christ over
[32:37] it." Amen. Thank you this morning for
[32:40] being so good to us.
[32:43] Such a privilege to be in the house of
[32:44] God.
[32:46] Man, we got some prayer requests this
[32:48] morning. And
[32:50] man, it says that Lance, a friend of
[32:54] Philip Martin, has gone to the ER for
[32:56] complications with his pancreas.
[33:00] Brother Harvey Savage and fell and
[33:03] injured his shoulder and he's in a lot
[33:05] of pain. and
[33:08] sister Lee and not feeling well. Let's
[33:11] pray for her. And
[33:14] brother David Hoffman turned in a
[33:16] request that friend of his, William
[33:18] Davis, has asked for prayer, he's having
[33:21] health issues. And
[33:23] how many believes that before they ever
[33:25] wrote down that our Lord knew all about
[33:28] it. Amen. But the Bible says, I heard a
[33:32] man saying the other day that oh, he
[33:34] said, you know, just the Lord will take
[33:35] care of it. Too proud to ask. But the
[33:37] Bible says ask. So I believe this
[33:40] morning that the children of God can
[33:42] come together and the authority was
[33:44] given to the church this morning,
[33:45] Brother West. So if you would, if you
[33:48] have something on your heart, you don't
[33:50] even have to raise your hand, but if you
[33:52] have something, raise your hand to the
[33:53] Lord. I know he knows all about it.
[33:55] Let's take these to the throne of grace
[33:57] this morning.
[34:00] our kind, precious heavenly father.
[34:04] Lord, there's such a mighty God this
[34:06] morning. I think sometimes, Lord, I
[34:09] won't speak for anybody else, but Lord,
[34:11] me, sometimes, Lord, in our humanity, we
[34:15] may try to limit you, but you're a
[34:17] limitless God. this today, Lord. And I
[34:20] believe that today that you're mindful
[34:23] of your children and so much that the
[34:26] Bible says that by your stripes, we're
[34:28] healed.
[34:29] And Lord, I heard brother Brandon saying
[34:32] it's in the scripture in Psalms that one
[34:35] day the children of Israel, they was on
[34:37] their road and they was in the will of
[34:39] God and they come down to the Red Sea
[34:43] and the Red Sea was in their way and
[34:45] Pharaoh's army was behind them and they
[34:47] had no place to go. And what a dark
[34:50] moment it looked like. And it looked
[34:52] like he was a poor general, but they was
[34:55] serving a supernatural God. And the
[34:57] Bible says that that God looked down out
[35:00] of heaven with angry eyes and the sea
[35:02] got scared and rolled back and they
[35:05] crossed on dry ground. Lord, I believe
[35:08] today that those that are sick and
[35:10] afflicted that you could look down today
[35:12] through the blood of Jesus Christ and
[35:14] this sickness would get scared and it'd
[35:16] have to leave. Lord, I believe your word
[35:19] is true today. The Bible says to come
[35:21] asking this morning. We're asking for
[35:23] your mercy and asking for your grace for
[35:26] these different ones, Lord. And those
[35:28] that raised their hand. And maybe
[35:29] somebody didn't even feel like they
[35:31] could raise their hand and have a need,
[35:33] Lord. Whatever it might be, maybe today,
[35:36] as we say in a sling, feeling blue
[35:39] today. But Lord, you're God. David said
[35:42] that you're a lifter up in my head this
[35:44] morning. God, I thank you for it, Lord.
[35:46] And I believe that you in the service
[35:48] today and believe you're mindful of us.
[35:51] And I pray that you'd be merciful to
[35:53] each one. And again, we thank you for
[35:56] your love and mercy and for this time
[35:57] that we have to fellowship. And Lord,
[36:00] that's what you wanted was fellowship.
[36:01] And I pray that each one that's here
[36:04] would be mindful today that we just want
[36:06] to love you. And thank you again. And
[36:08] those that couldn't be here, I pray
[36:09] you'd be with them. And we'd be careful
[36:11] to give you the praise. In Jesus name we
[36:13] ask it. Amen. And amen.
[36:16] [Music]
[36:26] As brother Matt makes plans to come, I
[36:30] was going to sing this and
[36:32] if you would, it's kind of something I
[36:34] sing as a special, but I believe that
[36:37] God's worthy of all our praise. So, if
[36:38] you would sing it with me, we come to
[36:42] honor the Lord this morning. It's good
[36:43] to see you. But brother Brian, I don't
[36:45] want to hurt your feelings, but it's
[36:47] good to see you while I'm here. But I
[36:49] come to see the Lord today, and I know
[36:51] you did, too. So, let's just take just a
[36:54] moment, if you would. I believe that he
[36:56] could speak to our hearts this morning
[36:58] through the preaching of the word. And
[37:00] let's just take a moment to worship him.
[37:02] And as brother Matt makes ready to come.
[37:10] And there was
[37:13] a mountain.
[37:16] There were three trees.
[37:20] [Music]
[37:21] There was
[37:24] a good man.
[37:26] And there were two things.
[37:31] A man called Barabus
[37:36] was doomed
[37:38] for a tree.
[37:41] But Jesus took that middle one.
[37:46] The rabbus
[37:49] went free.
[37:53] And I love
[37:56] that man
[37:59] in the middle
[38:04] because I know
[38:06] he first
[38:09] loved me.
[38:13] Oh, and praise to that man
[38:18] who died on Mount Calvary. Oh, just
[38:23] loving this morning.
[38:26] Made it possible
[38:29] that I could go free.
[38:36] Think about the scene. A hill called
[38:39] Goga.
[38:42] the place
[38:44] of a skull.
[38:47] No yellow flowers, no trees in bloom.
[38:52] The scenery was so dull.
[38:57] Three crosses
[38:59] stood black and bold
[39:02] against
[39:03] a darkened sky.
[39:07] Not from pain, but a broken heart.
[39:12] That little
[39:14] man died.
[39:16] Oh, raise your hand to love him. And I
[39:19] love
[39:21] that man
[39:24] in the middle
[39:27] [Music]
[39:29] because I know
[39:31] he first
[39:34] loved me.
[39:39] And praise to that man
[39:44] who died on Mount Calvary.
[39:49] That middle man made it possible
[39:54] that I could go free. If you would sing
[39:59] that second verse again. A hill called
[40:03] Goga.
[40:06] The place
[40:08] of a go.
[40:11] No yellow flowers, no trees in bloom.
[40:16] The scenery was so dull.
[40:23] Stood black and bold
[40:26] against
[40:27] a darken sky.
[40:31] Not from pain, but a broken heart.
[40:36] That middle
[40:38] man died.
[40:40] [Music]
[40:42] And I love
[40:45] that man
[40:48] in the middle
[40:50] [Music]
[40:52] because I know
[40:55] he first
[40:57] loved me.
[41:02] And praise to that man
[41:07] who died on Mount Calvary.
[41:12] That middle man made it possible
[41:17] that I could go free.
[41:23] Amen. We was that Barabus,
[41:27] man. He was really He was guilty of it,
[41:29] but he got to go free. The Lord took our
[41:32] place.
[41:34] Man, um hate to speed it up after
[41:37] singing something slow, but could we
[41:39] sing uh I feel like traveling on. Um
[41:44] maybe F. I don't know.
[41:51] My heavenly home is proud and fair. I
[41:56] feel like traveling on.
[42:01] No pain, no death can enter there. I
[42:06] feel like traveling on.
[42:11] Yes, I feel like traveling on.
[42:16] I feel like traveling on.
[42:20] My heavenly home is bright and fair. I
[42:26] feel like traveling home.
[42:30] It's glittering.
[42:33] The sun I'll shine. I feel
[42:37] [Applause]
[42:39] [Music]
[42:43] shall be mine. I feel like traveling on.
[42:50] Yes, I feel like traveling on. home. I
[42:55] feel like traveling on
[43:00] my heavenly home is bright in fear. I
[43:05] feel like traveling on.
[43:09] I say the Lord has been so good to me. I
[43:15] feel like traveling on
[43:19] until that blessed home I see. I feel
[43:25] like traveling on.
[43:28] Yes, I feel like traveling.
[43:33] Amen. How many feels good this morning?
[43:35] Amen. Won't you just shake somebody's
[43:37] hand and go welcome somebody in the
[43:39] house of the Lord this morning? It's
[43:42] bright and fair. I feel like traveling
[43:46] on.
[43:48] I say the Lord has been so good to me. I
[43:53] feel like traveling on
[43:58] until that blessed home I see. I feel
[44:04] like traveling on.
[44:07] Yes, I feel like traveling home.
[44:12] I feel like traveling on.
[44:17] My heavenly home is bright and fair. I
[44:23] feel like traveling
[44:25] on.
[44:27] [Music]
[44:30] Amen. How many say the Lord has been
[44:32] good to me? I said, how many say the
[44:35] Lord's been good to me? Amen. Can you
[44:37] give him a big hand clap of praise? I
[44:40] think he's been good to you. Amen.
[44:44] Amen. I just love the Lord this morning
[44:46] and sure good to be in the house of the
[44:48] Lord and Amen. How many say it's good to
[44:51] be here? Amen. And you know, I just want
[44:53] to say I appreciate each one. And
[44:56] certainly appreciate all the all the
[44:59] services that we've been having. And you
[45:01] know, I want to make a statement this
[45:03] morning before I get into the word. But
[45:06] I sure appreciate brothers and ministers
[45:08] and evangelists that God has called in
[45:10] this uh in this time to be able to come
[45:14] and be a help to us at our church and
[45:16] and uh we don't always uh get to take
[45:19] time but I appreciate every one of them.
[45:21] I know they uh many come from different
[45:23] places to be a blessing to us and uh I
[45:26] want to say this. I thank God for God
[45:28] called men and God- sent churches and uh
[45:31] that that stand on the word of God. But
[45:32] I never think that we're the only one
[45:34] and don't ever uh want anybody to ever
[45:36] get that thought in their mind that we
[45:38] think we're the only church that
[45:40] preaches the word. There are a lot of
[45:41] really wonderful churches that stand on
[45:43] the same gospel that we do. And I thank
[45:45] God for every one of them. We're not
[45:47] here to build our church. It ain't not
[45:49] here just to to try to build Grace
[45:51] Tabernacle, but we're here to build
[45:53] God's church and bring in members to
[45:55] that glorious kingdom of God by a new
[45:58] birth. That's our that's our zeal.
[45:59] That's the the vision of this church.
[46:01] And I believe it ought to be the vision
[46:03] of every person and it ought to be the
[46:05] heart of every believer. I I believe
[46:07] that's the way the prophet of God stood.
[46:08] He said, you know, there are there are
[46:11] uh uh whiskey or liquor stores on every
[46:14] corner and there's places of amusement
[46:16] in every city. He said, but what we need
[46:18] is churches on every corner doing their
[46:20] bit for the glory of God. And I believe
[46:22] that's what we want tonight. And he
[46:24] said, I never want to criticize them. I
[46:26] never have any criticism for them. And
[46:29] uh I think that ought to be our heart
[46:31] this morning is uh not to criticize one
[46:34] another but just to bring a unity of
[46:36] brotherhood amongst the brothers. How
[46:38] many believes that this morning? I I
[46:40] believe that's the zeal of our church.
[46:41] That's the stand that I want to make.
[46:43] That's what we want to be known for. And
[46:45] isn't that what Jesus taught us? He
[46:46] said, "Love your enemies, not love your
[46:49] friends." He said, "Love your enemies.
[46:52] uh do good to those uh that despitefully
[46:54] use you and bless them that curse you
[46:56] and that you may be the children of your
[46:59] father. Be ye therefore perfect. Isn't
[47:02] that something? Jesus said, "Love your
[47:03] enemies and be perfect." So, loving your
[47:05] enemies is a sign of perfection. I think
[47:08] that's what we ought to do. We ought to
[47:09] love everybody. And you know, that's
[47:11] that was the nature of God. That's
[47:13] that's what God done. The Bible says he
[47:15] made the sun to shine on the just and
[47:17] the unjust. He made the rain to fall on
[47:20] the just and the unjust. That's why
[47:22] Jesus said, "Love your enemies." Well,
[47:24] we may as well just say it. Love your
[47:26] enemy. How many knows what their enemies
[47:27] are? It ain't somebody in a foreign
[47:29] land. But can I just break that down for
[47:31] you? This is all free. But that word
[47:33] enemy comes from the Greek word ecos,
[47:35] which meant those that were hateful to
[47:37] you. That's the hardest people to love
[47:39] is the people that are hateful. But
[47:40] Jesus said, "Love them and be perfect."
[47:43] That's right. So, it's a sign of
[47:44] perfection to love those that are
[47:46] hateful. How many how many can do that
[47:47] this morning? Boy, I don't want to take
[47:49] the shout out of the church, but we may
[47:50] as well say amen. It's the word of God.
[47:53] Amen. Love your enemies and be ye
[47:55] therefore perfect. Amen. Is that our
[47:57] desire this morning? Amen. To love one
[48:00] another. And so, we just want to get uh
[48:02] maybe just bow our heads this morning
[48:04] and and and before we open the word of
[48:07] God and just ask the Lord to come. You
[48:09] have a need on your heart, just lift
[48:10] your hand to the Lord. I know he's
[48:11] mindful of what we have need of this
[48:14] morning. Let's just invite him to come.
[48:16] and gracious heavenly father, Lord, what
[48:18] a privilege it is to serve you, Lord.
[48:20] And God, an honor I can say to be a son
[48:23] of God and to be a believer. And Lord,
[48:25] that you have called us in this hour.
[48:27] And Lord, I feel so unworthy, Lord,
[48:30] every time I think of that very thing.
[48:32] And but Lord, here we stand, Lord, today
[48:35] as a body of believers. Lord, we come
[48:37] together in thy precious name, Lord, to
[48:40] read the word of life, Lord, that you've
[48:42] given unto us. And Lord, we just ask you
[48:44] that you would come this morning and you
[48:46] would anoint these words. And Lord, let
[48:48] it come to life in the heart of every
[48:50] believer. Lord, let there be such a
[48:52] revival in our hearts this morning, God.
[48:54] That we would leave this place knowing
[48:55] that we've been in your presence. Lord,
[48:57] we ask you to help each one, Lord,
[48:59] that's in need. And Lord, we'll just
[49:01] give you the glory for all that you do.
[49:02] In Jesus name we pray. And the church
[49:05] says, "Amen." Amen. God bless you this
[49:08] morning. We just want to invite you to
[49:10] the scripture uh to the book of
[49:12] Revelations and we're going to read out
[49:15] of the third chapter and the 14th verse.
[49:18] We'll give you uh just a moment to get
[49:21] there. Revelations the third chapter in
[49:23] the 14th verse and then we'll also read
[49:26] from Ephesians the first first chapter
[49:29] uh following that. So Revelations 3:14
[49:33] and we'll read down to the 18th verse.
[49:35] The Bible says, "And unto the angel of
[49:37] the church of the Leodysans, write these
[49:40] things the Amen, the faithful and true
[49:43] witness, the beginning of the creation
[49:45] of God. I know thy works that thou art
[49:48] neither cold nor hot, I would that you
[49:51] were cold or hot. So then, because you
[49:54] are lukewarm, and neither cold nor hot,
[49:57] I will spew thee out of my mouth.
[50:00] Because thou sayest, I am rich and
[50:01] increased with goods, and have need of
[50:03] nothing, and knowest not that thou art
[50:05] wretched, and miserable, and poor, and
[50:08] blind, and naked. I counsel thee to buy
[50:10] of me gold tried in the fire, that thou
[50:14] mayest be rich, and white raignment,
[50:16] that thou mayest be clothed, and that
[50:18] the shame of thy nakedness do not
[50:20] appear, and anoint thine eyes with eyes,
[50:23] that thou mayest see. And I also want to
[50:27] read out of the book of Ephesians the
[50:29] the first chapter and we'll read from
[50:31] the fourth verse.
[50:33] The Bible says according as he hath
[50:36] chosen us in him before the foundation
[50:39] of the world that we should be holy and
[50:42] without blame before him in love, having
[50:45] predestinated us unto the adoption of
[50:47] children by Jesus Christ to himself
[50:51] according to the good pleasure of his
[50:53] will. And we'll just ask the Lord to add
[50:56] his blessings to the reading of the word
[50:58] this morning. I want to speak on this
[51:00] subject on manifesting the works of God.
[51:04] Amen. Now here in Revelations the third
[51:06] chapter, I know this is a very uh
[51:08] familiar scripture reading here uh uh we
[51:12] have many times has read uh through this
[51:15] and we know that uh Revelations the 2
[51:17] and the third chapter. If you're a Bible
[51:20] studier uh you know that it's speaking
[51:22] uh not only uh of the of the churches
[51:25] that are in Asia, but it's speaking of
[51:27] ages of time from the time of Jesus's
[51:30] ascension until now. And uh we realize
[51:32] that this book of revelation it was
[51:34] written by John. It was a vision that
[51:36] John had on the aisle of Patmas. And as
[51:39] he would write about this he would come
[51:40] to this portion the second chapter and
[51:42] the third chapter and he he would begin
[51:44] to uh to reveal the condition of every
[51:47] age. as uh uh you know from the age of
[51:49] Ephesus to Samrna to Pergamus to
[51:52] Thitara, Sardis, Philadelphia uh here in
[51:55] this book or in these two chapters there
[51:58] lays 2,000 years of the history of the
[52:00] church. So if you look from now all the
[52:03] way back to the time of Jesus right in
[52:04] Revelations the second third chapter
[52:06] there's 2,000 years of church history
[52:08] that shows the condition of every church
[52:11] age. It shows the the message that God
[52:14] sent to that church and then a reward
[52:16] for overcoming uh in that very age. And
[52:19] so when you're reading through this and
[52:20] studying, you'll find in the in Leodysa,
[52:23] this this church in Leodysa, it actually
[52:25] shows the conditions of this age. Every
[52:27] age, it showed the conditions of the
[52:29] age. But when it comes to Leoa, it shows
[52:32] the conditions of this age is an age of
[52:35] lukewarmness. It's the it's an age of
[52:37] spiritual blindness. And I I realize
[52:39] that there were many that were born
[52:41] through the ages over the past 2,000
[52:43] years that never experienced the spirit
[52:46] this age that we're living in now.
[52:48] There's been many believers and been
[52:49] many uh part of the bride. Brother Mark
[52:52] that has lived uh through all these
[52:54] years that didn't experience what me and
[52:55] you experienced today because we're
[52:57] living in a different age than they
[52:59] lived in. But but I want to uh uh as a
[53:01] as a foundation this morning, I want to
[53:03] note that uh that we're not the first
[53:05] people to experience spiritual
[53:07] blindness. Although although this
[53:08] scripture was talking about it was an
[53:10] age of spiritual blindness and here uh
[53:12] that that that it would be a blind they
[53:14] would not be able to see but uh we're
[53:16] not the first people to experience that
[53:18] because the many in the world uh
[53:20] throughout each age have been blind.
[53:22] There's been spiritual blindness. As a
[53:24] matter of fact, the the disciples even
[53:25] when they had asked Jesus one time, why
[53:27] would he speak in parables, Jesus
[53:29] answered, he said to fulfill the prophet
[53:31] Isaiah because he said hearing they
[53:33] shall hear and wouldn't understand and
[53:36] seeing they would see but they wouldn't
[53:37] perceive. He said for the people's heart
[53:39] is waxed gross. Their ears are dull of
[53:41] hearing. Their eyes they have closed
[53:43] lest at any time they should see with
[53:45] their eyes and hear with their ears and
[53:47] understand with their heart and they
[53:49] would be converted and I should heal
[53:51] them. In other words, Jesus is laying a
[53:53] foundation to the disciples, saying that
[53:55] their ears are are are held from hearing
[53:58] and their eyes are blind from seeing to
[54:00] fulfill Isaiah so that they wouldn't
[54:03] receive their healing. So that they
[54:04] wouldn't be able to see. So Jesus says,
[54:06] "I speak in parables that their eyes
[54:08] aren't opened. I speak in parables so
[54:10] that they can't hear." Watch what he's
[54:12] doing here. He said, "But blessed are
[54:14] your eyes for they see, and blessed are
[54:16] your ears, for they hear." So even in
[54:19] the time of Jesus we find out that there
[54:21] were many that were spiritually blind.
[54:23] Even uh Mark the 11th chapter Jesus said
[54:25] I thank thee father uh the lord of
[54:27] heaven and earth because you have hid
[54:29] these things from the eyes of the wise
[54:31] and prudent and revealed them unto
[54:33] babes. So here Jesus uses two words. He
[54:35] says hid. Somebody say hid and then he
[54:38] says revealed. Somebody say revealed. So
[54:40] in these two words we see what Jesus is
[54:42] speaking of is spiritual blindness. So,
[54:45] so even from the time of Jesus, we find
[54:47] out that hiding and revealing have
[54:50] always been God's doing. So, so, so the
[54:53] hiding and the revealing, the hid and
[54:55] the reveal, it's always been something
[54:57] that God is doing. Even when it came to
[54:59] Israel, that's why Apostle Paul, he
[55:01] would say that blindness in part has
[55:02] happened to Israel until the fullness of
[55:05] the Gentiles come in. That's why Israel
[55:07] became an enemy to the church. And Paul
[55:09] said they are your enemy when it comes
[55:11] for the gospel sake. He said, "But when
[55:13] it comes to election, they're not."
[55:15] Because when when it comes to election,
[55:17] they belong to God. And in the end,
[55:19] God's going to have them because he
[55:20] promised they would be his children. He
[55:23] said, "So because of your sake and the
[55:24] gospel sake, they're your enemy. They
[55:26] don't believe what you believe. They're
[55:28] going to persecute you. They're going to
[55:29] ridicule you for following after Jesus."
[55:32] He said, "They're your enemy in that
[55:33] sense." He said, "But in another sense,
[55:35] they're elected of God. But God has
[55:37] blinded them in this hour until the
[55:38] fullness of the Gentile has come in."
[55:41] So, so we see that all through the Bible
[55:43] there's been blindness that has happened
[55:45] in the world. All through the Bible,
[55:47] blindness has happened to the
[55:49] unbeliever. You say, well, what is the
[55:51] significance of saying this in
[55:52] Revelations the the third chapter? Why
[55:55] would God make it a significant to bring
[55:57] it to John in a revelations? If it's
[55:59] supposed to be a great revelation and
[56:01] blindness has always been there,
[56:02] spiritual blindness has always been
[56:04] around since the very beginning of time.
[56:07] But you realize, but the difference is
[56:09] in Revelations the third chapter, it's
[56:11] not talking about the world. It's not
[56:14] talking about the unbeliever. All
[56:16] through time, spiritual blindness was in
[56:18] the world and spiritual blindness was in
[56:20] unbelievers. But now when John writes
[56:22] this, now he's talking about the
[56:25] condition of God's church. He said, but
[56:27] now the church is blind. So here we're
[56:30] born in an age that the church has
[56:33] received spiritual blindness. We're born
[56:34] in an age that that we're not talking
[56:36] about unbelievers anymore. We're not
[56:38] talking about the world anymore, but
[56:39] we're talking about the church of the
[56:40] living God. He said we're living in the
[56:42] age when the church have become
[56:44] spiritually blind. This is the age when
[56:46] the church has become lukewarm. Can I
[56:48] preach an hour on that? Is this not the
[56:50] age of spiritual lukewarmness? I'm not
[56:52] talking about lukewarmness in the world
[56:54] or or lukewarmness in the unbeliever,
[56:56] but John's writing about the church of
[56:58] the living God. He said, "This is the
[57:00] age of lukewarmness in God's church."
[57:03] church. Isn't that the truth? You know
[57:04] why it's so hard to pray through? You
[57:06] know why it's so hard to come to church
[57:08] and and to be on fire for God and why
[57:10] it's so hard to get to a place
[57:11] spiritually where there's a revival
[57:13] burning in your heart? Because in this
[57:15] age of leosia, it's the age of spiritual
[57:18] lukewarmness. Not to the world. We're
[57:21] talking about to the church, not to the
[57:22] unbeliever. I'm talking about to the
[57:24] church. It's the age of lukewarmness.
[57:27] This is the age where the church was
[57:28] blind. It's the age where the church was
[57:30] miserable. It's the age where the church
[57:32] was in her nakedness. And listen what
[57:34] God done in this age just like he done
[57:36] in every other age. The Bible said this
[57:38] is a message unto the messenger of
[57:40] Leodysa. In other words, that God sent a
[57:43] message to this age. And I got news for
[57:45] you. Just like the age wasn't talking
[57:47] about the world. Neither was the message
[57:49] to the world, but the message was to
[57:51] God's church. It came right to the
[57:53] church. And according to John's vision,
[57:55] there would come a messenger to the
[57:56] church that would preach a message of
[57:58] repentance. That makes me want to shout
[58:00] to think about it. Isn't that the very
[58:02] message that John the Baptist had? It
[58:04] was a message of repentance. He said,
[58:06] but he would come and preach repent. And
[58:08] notice what it would do. That very
[58:10] message in this age, it would call a
[58:12] bride out of the church, a spiritual
[58:14] bride of Jesus Christ. And the very
[58:16] message of this age, it would take the
[58:18] condition of Leoa off of you and put the
[58:22] it put the spirit of God right back upon
[58:24] the church again. It would take the
[58:26] spirit of nakedness and clothe you with
[58:28] righteousness. It it would take you out
[58:30] of your misery. It would open the eyes
[58:32] of the church and it would set the
[58:33] church on fire again. The very thing
[58:36] that the church was in Le Oysia, the
[58:39] message of the hour would lift the
[58:41] church out of that very condition. I
[58:43] don't know about y'all, but that makes
[58:44] me want to shout all over this building
[58:46] that God would send a message to take
[58:48] the church out of this condition. Here
[58:50] it is. 2,000 years ago, it was talked
[58:53] about and prophesied and wrote about the
[58:55] condition that the church was going to
[58:57] be in in the year 2025. But when God
[59:00] looked down and he wrote that in the
[59:02] Bible, he said, "But I'm going to send a
[59:04] message in that very hour that'll bring
[59:06] the church of the living God, out of the
[59:08] condition of Leoa, I will clothe them. I
[59:11] will give them eyesight. I I will bring
[59:13] them out of their misery. I'll put a
[59:15] revival in their heart that right in the
[59:17] midst of lukewarmness, they can stand to
[59:19] their feet and raise their hands and
[59:21] say, "Amen and shout to the name of the
[59:23] Lord because the revival of the message
[59:26] of the hour has came to the church of
[59:27] the living God." I think this is a
[59:30] powerful point. It wasn't to a specific
[59:32] church either. It was to a bo y y'all
[59:34] feel like preaching this morning. It was
[59:36] to a body of believers. It was it was it
[59:39] was those that were called out of the
[59:40] church. So, one by one, their ears
[59:43] become open. one by one their eyes their
[59:46] eyes would open that they may see. I
[59:48] think this is a powerful point that John
[59:51] saw this in a vision 2,000 years ago
[59:54] which tells us that Jesus knew the end
[59:56] from the beginning. He knew that there
[59:58] would be the age. He knew that would be
[59:59] the condition. He knew what it would
[1:00:01] take to bring us out of it. He knew it
[1:00:02] would be a terrible age but he knew that
[1:00:04] there would be a people that would be
[1:00:05] able to overcome it. You say, "Brother
[1:00:07] Matt, the pressures of this age are too
[1:00:09] hard." You know, sometimes it feels that
[1:00:11] way. I think I'd rather live in the days
[1:00:12] of Jesus where I could have followed him
[1:00:14] around and been one of his disciples. I
[1:00:16] I think I'd rather lived in the days of
[1:00:18] Elijah where I could went up on Mount
[1:00:19] Carmel and watch him say, "Let the Lord
[1:00:22] God that answerth by fire be God." I I
[1:00:24] think I would rather live in the days of
[1:00:25] Apostle Paul when he was when he was
[1:00:27] leading the church and laying a a
[1:00:29] foundation and the miracles followed
[1:00:30] after his life. Wouldn't it have been
[1:00:32] much easier? Well, friends, I've got
[1:00:33] news for you. It might have been easier,
[1:00:35] but all I know is this. But the reward
[1:00:37] in Leodysa is far much greater. For
[1:00:40] Jesus said that he that overcomemeth in
[1:00:42] this age, I grant to sit with me in my
[1:00:45] throne. That means friends, if God put
[1:00:47] you here, then God knew that you could
[1:00:49] overcome this age. And he knew there'd
[1:00:51] be overcomers in this age. That's why
[1:00:53] Paul would write in Ephesians the first
[1:00:55] chapter, he'd say, "He has chosen us in
[1:00:58] him before the foundation of the world."
[1:01:00] Somebody say, "Amen." How many How
[1:01:02] many's part of that chosen? He He chose
[1:01:04] us in him before the foundation of the
[1:01:06] world. You know what that is? It's a
[1:01:08] type of election. And it's talking about
[1:01:10] election. That God chose you. He elected
[1:01:12] you before the foundation of the world
[1:01:14] that you might be holy and without blame
[1:01:17] before him in love. That means God saw
[1:01:20] you in this wretched condition and he
[1:01:22] chose you before the foundation of the
[1:01:24] world that you might be holy. You ever
[1:01:26] thought about that? That God chose you
[1:01:28] to be holy and God chose you to be
[1:01:30] blameless and God chose you to be in him
[1:01:32] in love that there couldn't be no blame
[1:01:34] put upon your life. He chose you. He
[1:01:37] elected you before the foundation of the
[1:01:38] world that me we might be without blame.
[1:01:41] And Paul said, "Having predestinated us
[1:01:43] under the adoption of children by Jesus
[1:01:45] Christ to himself according to the good
[1:01:48] pleasure of his will." In other words,
[1:01:50] it is our destiny to be a child of God.
[1:01:53] Somebody say destiny. It's our destiny
[1:01:57] to be a child of God. That's our
[1:01:59] destiny. In other words, you are
[1:02:01] ordained. It's your ordained destiny is
[1:02:04] to be a believer. I know the church
[1:02:06] world don't like that term. I I can feel
[1:02:08] it every time you talk about it, but I'm
[1:02:09] going to give the devil a black eye
[1:02:10] anyway. They don't like to to talk about
[1:02:13] predestinated or or or that God chose.
[1:02:15] It makes God seem unfair, doesn't it?
[1:02:17] When you it does when you teach it
[1:02:18] wrong. See, and that's the only reason
[1:02:20] they don't believe in it because it
[1:02:21] isn't taught properly. But in and the
[1:02:23] ones that will accept that you have a
[1:02:25] predetermined destination, the ones that
[1:02:27] accept that, the only way they will
[1:02:29] accept it is by redefining destiny to
[1:02:32] fit their line of thought. Then they can
[1:02:33] believe it. I I read a I read a a a good
[1:02:35] Baptist uh uh uh deal the other day and
[1:02:38] he was talking about predestination. He
[1:02:39] says, you know, our destiny is a path of
[1:02:42] possibilities. He said, so in other
[1:02:44] words, that we have predetermined
[1:02:46] possibilities. So so that so we're
[1:02:48] destined by God because we're guaranteed
[1:02:50] to we're guaranteed to die or we're
[1:02:52] guaranteed to go in a in a rapture. You
[1:02:53] know, we we we you know, outside of a
[1:02:55] rapture, every one of us are going to
[1:02:56] die in this flesh. He said, "So our
[1:02:59] destiny is the possibility of heaven or
[1:03:01] hell." I thought, well, what a goofy
[1:03:03] bunch of stuff. That ain't what the
[1:03:04] Bible says. Our destiny is not a
[1:03:07] possibility. How could that even be a
[1:03:08] destiny? But the Bible says that we have
[1:03:11] a predetermined destination. Somebody
[1:03:14] say amen. But what they say is, well,
[1:03:16] that you can't have that because it
[1:03:18] takes away free will. But I can tell you
[1:03:19] what a prophet said. He said that don't
[1:03:21] take away free will. That's the very
[1:03:22] thing that that that God used in the
[1:03:24] Garden of Eden. That free will is what
[1:03:27] made them fall in the garden. Although
[1:03:29] that they were predestinated by God, you
[1:03:31] were called by God, you were chosen by
[1:03:33] God. He said, but but he said this is a
[1:03:35] great revelation. He said God had to let
[1:03:37] them sin. So he put them on a free moral
[1:03:40] agency because remember God knew that
[1:03:42] they were going to fall. The Bible says
[1:03:43] he created or said he created Eve
[1:03:46] knowing that she would fall. God is all
[1:03:48] knowing. God there's nothing ever caught
[1:03:50] God by surprise. So So they knew that
[1:03:52] she would fall, but he created her
[1:03:54] anyway. He knew they would be in that
[1:03:55] condition, but God wanted to manifest
[1:03:57] his attributes. But God certainly
[1:04:00] couldn't force them to fall. What kind
[1:04:02] of God would that be? He said, "How
[1:04:03] could he make them sin and remain God
[1:04:06] and punish them for something that he
[1:04:07] made them do?" But when he put man on
[1:04:09] earth in his partnership with him, he
[1:04:11] let that man act as a free moral agent.
[1:04:14] See, the same thing that he's got you on
[1:04:16] today. So, you can act any way you want
[1:04:18] to because you're a free moral agent.
[1:04:21] Therefore, he put the first one like
[1:04:22] that. He has to put the second one.
[1:04:24] Everyone liked that or he acted wrong in
[1:04:26] the first place. So everybody is on that
[1:04:28] same basis. We are free moral agents.
[1:04:31] See, so it doesn't take away
[1:04:32] predestination. God knows but but God
[1:04:34] knows what you're going to do. He knows
[1:04:36] where you're going to end up. So
[1:04:37] predestination don't take away free
[1:04:39] will. In fact, I believe this this
[1:04:41] morning that we are all predestinated to
[1:04:44] something. Whether you believe in
[1:04:45] predestination or not, every person in
[1:04:48] the world is predestinated by God.
[1:04:52] Let me just lay that out there so you
[1:04:53] can see where I'm going. Everybody in
[1:04:56] the entire world is predestinated by
[1:04:58] God. God knows every one of our end from
[1:05:00] our beginning. God knows where we're
[1:05:02] going to end up. There is a
[1:05:03] predetermined destination for every soul
[1:05:06] that ever walked up on the face of the
[1:05:08] earth. Or God isn't God. How could he be
[1:05:10] eternal and not know the destination of
[1:05:12] every human being? But we're all God
[1:05:15] knows. We're we're all predestinated
[1:05:17] because we are predestinated by the
[1:05:19] fornowledge of God. He's an eternal God.
[1:05:22] He knows the end from the beginning. And
[1:05:23] by fornowledge, God knows where we're
[1:05:25] going to end up. You say, well, you
[1:05:27] know, one said, well, destiny is our
[1:05:28] framework. And you know, our free will
[1:05:30] is what we build within that framework.
[1:05:32] And I I said, well, you know, you know
[1:05:34] that the reality of that is is that I
[1:05:36] believe even in that framework of your
[1:05:39] life that the things that you do is
[1:05:41] impressed by God for you to do it. It
[1:05:44] don't mean you don't do things that God
[1:05:45] don't want you to do because sometimes
[1:05:47] we do. But what is that that's drawing
[1:05:49] you to God? What what is that that
[1:05:51] that's leading you and pulling you and
[1:05:53] see God is impressing on you to build in
[1:05:56] the direction of his choosing? He he he
[1:05:59] puts little things by you. He causes
[1:06:01] people to come by and say something. He
[1:06:03] causes he drops a little something in
[1:06:05] your heart. He'll put a little sign on
[1:06:07] the side of the road. You'll read a
[1:06:08] little post on Facebook or something.
[1:06:10] God is always putting things in our life
[1:06:13] to to to impress upon us to build in the
[1:06:16] direction that God wants us to go. See,
[1:06:18] he's drawing us. But Mark, he pulls us
[1:06:21] right into our position and into our
[1:06:23] placing. Can Can I just ask you that
[1:06:25] this morning? How do you think you got
[1:06:26] here this morning? What What was it that
[1:06:28] caused you to come to church? I I'll
[1:06:30] just go ahead and say it. You were drawn
[1:06:32] here by God. You were drawn by God. You
[1:06:35] realize that this morning the casinos
[1:06:36] are filled up tonight. The light the
[1:06:38] nightclubs will be filled up today. The
[1:06:41] barrooms will be filled up. Clubs will
[1:06:43] be filled up. There's a lot of places
[1:06:44] that you could be, but there's something
[1:06:46] that draw you to the house of God to
[1:06:48] hear the word of God. You say, "Brother
[1:06:50] Matt, well, I'll tell you what Jesus
[1:06:51] said it was." He said, "No man can come
[1:06:53] unto me except my father would draw him
[1:06:56] first, and I will raise him up in the
[1:06:58] last day." You are drawn by God to
[1:07:02] fulfill your destiny. How many believe
[1:07:04] that this morning? You're drawn by God
[1:07:06] to fulfill your very destiny. I I read a
[1:07:09] comment uh tater on or commentary on
[1:07:11] that scripture. The Bible said the ver
[1:07:13] or the it says this verse implies that
[1:07:15] salvation is a gift from God. How many
[1:07:17] believe that? Say amen. It's not
[1:07:19] something that's earned by human effort,
[1:07:21] but it also emphasizes God's sovereignty
[1:07:24] and his active role in drawing people to
[1:07:28] the faith. My isn't that good? God has
[1:07:30] an active role in drawing us to the
[1:07:33] faith that he wants us to walk in. So I
[1:07:36] I say this, you say, "What was it?" I
[1:07:38] say, "What drew you is a connection
[1:07:40] between you and God." Just like our
[1:07:42] brother was preaching the other day on
[1:07:43] that on that natural seed and how that
[1:07:46] the sun because the sun would begin to
[1:07:48] shine. You realize that that seed it
[1:07:50] that that seed isn't doing anything on
[1:07:52] its own. It's being drawn by it. Every
[1:07:54] every lower species is drawn by a higher
[1:07:57] species. And so here the sun is drawing
[1:08:00] on it. It it can't help but go towards
[1:08:02] the sun because there's a draw there
[1:08:04] that pulls it to it. And just like the
[1:08:06] natural, it's the same way with a
[1:08:08] predestinated seed of God that whenever
[1:08:10] that seed is in you, you're drawn by the
[1:08:12] sen that whenever he's drawn, Jesus
[1:08:15] said, "If I be lifted up, I will draw
[1:08:17] all men unto me." It's it's him that is
[1:08:20] drawing us to fulfill our destiny in
[1:08:23] this hour. I say everything has a
[1:08:25] destiny. I may as well preach it. Every
[1:08:27] the heavens have a destiny. The earth
[1:08:29] has a destiny. The world has a destiny.
[1:08:31] Even this great country that we live in,
[1:08:32] do you realize it has a predetermined
[1:08:34] destination?
[1:08:36] Brother Bam said that that's what it
[1:08:37] would do. You can find it in Revelations
[1:08:39] the 13th chapter. Remember the beast
[1:08:41] that would come up out of the land call
[1:08:43] under the image of that first beast
[1:08:44] which was that that pagan Rome that
[1:08:46] turned to paple Rome and and here that
[1:08:48] spirit of Catholicism would take over
[1:08:50] the world. But one day right out of
[1:08:52] America would come these great
[1:08:54] denominations under the world council of
[1:08:56] churches and they would fall under the
[1:08:58] image of that great beast and do the
[1:09:00] same things that it used to do. The very
[1:09:02] works of the beast will the will that
[1:09:04] same thing do. He said it would be a
[1:09:06] repeat performance of all the diabolical
[1:09:09] cunning and cruelty that was there
[1:09:10] before would be done again. It's the
[1:09:13] destiny of this nation. America, he said
[1:09:16] it's strikingly true. The United States,
[1:09:18] the very number 13 is a symbol of this
[1:09:20] nation. And it started with 13 colonies.
[1:09:22] Its flag has 13 stars and 13 stripes.
[1:09:25] And here is its destiny in the 13th
[1:09:27] chapter of Revelation. In this image, he
[1:09:30] said, see the world council church is
[1:09:31] all this ungodly satanic power that will
[1:09:34] vent the anger of the devil upon the
[1:09:36] true vine of God. So right here in the
[1:09:39] nation that we live in, brother Mark, is
[1:09:41] a spiritual oppression upon the true
[1:09:43] church of God. Why you think they make
[1:09:45] fun and persecute and put pressure? Let
[1:09:47] me tell you, that's where all the
[1:09:48] pressure will come from upon the church.
[1:09:51] Everybody's looking, it ain't coming
[1:09:52] from the world. It's coming from that
[1:09:54] great beast that that was rose up over
[1:09:56] in Rome. That that same spirit is in
[1:09:58] denominationalism that's putting
[1:10:00] pressure upon the church of the living
[1:10:02] God. But friends, I got news for you
[1:10:04] this morning. If a nation has a destiny
[1:10:07] and a world has a destiny and the church
[1:10:09] has a destiny, well, then so does the
[1:10:12] children of God have a destiny. And not
[1:10:14] only do we have a destiny, but God has
[1:10:16] given us a way to see it in this very
[1:10:19] hour. Brother Bam said, "Our election
[1:10:21] from God, it looks backwards to the
[1:10:23] fornowledge, but our predestination, it
[1:10:26] looks forward to our destiny. We were
[1:10:29] elected by God. It shows us where we
[1:10:31] came from, but we're predestinated. It
[1:10:33] shows us where we're going." Said, "See,
[1:10:35] election looks back." Said, "That's what
[1:10:37] happened to me. When I look at my life,
[1:10:39] you realize that our nature was an old
[1:10:41] cocka nature. And because that you were
[1:10:43] called of God and chose by God, elected
[1:10:46] by God, then he changed that nature to a
[1:10:48] grain of wheat. How many knows that he
[1:10:50] changed the nature to a grain of wheat?
[1:10:52] He said, "And I became wheat." And how
[1:10:54] did it happen? It was by election.
[1:10:56] Because God out of this whole field of
[1:10:58] cockaurs that's all over this field of
[1:11:00] the world that God would choose one that
[1:11:03] he would make a grain of wheat out of
[1:11:04] it. He said it was nothing but election
[1:11:06] that God would take that and make it a
[1:11:08] grain of wheat. He said before the
[1:11:10] foundation of the world he elected that
[1:11:12] cockaur to become a grain of wheat. He
[1:11:14] said now I know I'm a grain of wheat
[1:11:16] because I'm saved. You said well how did
[1:11:18] it do it? Well it looked back. You see
[1:11:20] what he predestinated a long time ago by
[1:11:22] fornowledge. He seen that I would love
[1:11:24] him. So he made a propitiation through
[1:11:26] his own son. God by fornowledge seen
[1:11:29] that I would love him. And he made a
[1:11:32] propitiation through his own son that
[1:11:34] through him I might come from a cockaur
[1:11:37] to a grain of wheat. And now, where am I
[1:11:39] at now? I'm saved. And I'm walking in
[1:11:41] the grace of God because God knew that I
[1:11:44] would love him. And God made a
[1:11:46] propitiation for my sin. He sent Jesus
[1:11:49] to the cross of Calvary cuz he knew that
[1:11:51] I would love him. And he's made a paid
[1:11:53] the price before I was ever born that I
[1:11:56] was elected by God to be a grain of
[1:11:58] wheat. You see, he looked back made I'm
[1:12:02] saved by the grace of God. He said,
[1:12:03] "What what does predestination do?"
[1:12:05] Predestination, it isn't looking back to
[1:12:07] where you came from. That's election.
[1:12:10] But predestination is speaking of a
[1:12:13] destination. It's talking about where
[1:12:15] you're going. It looks to your destiny.
[1:12:18] He said, "Where will he take me to?
[1:12:20] Where am I going?" It's looking to your
[1:12:22] destiny. And that's what's got you. I
[1:12:26] read that and I about shouted. In other
[1:12:28] words, that's what that's what's holding
[1:12:30] you. That's what's got you. That's
[1:12:33] what's holding you. That's what's
[1:12:35] anchored the church. He said because it
[1:12:37] looks to your destiny. Have you ever you
[1:12:39] ever thought about that? What's holding
[1:12:41] you in your place? Brother Mark, it's
[1:12:42] because you know your destination. And
[1:12:45] because you know your destination, you
[1:12:47] can make it through every trial. Because
[1:12:49] you know your destiny, you can go
[1:12:51] through hardship because you know at the
[1:12:52] end of the road where you're going to
[1:12:54] end up, that means it don't matter what
[1:12:55] the devil brings your way. The devil,
[1:12:57] you can bring the fire, you can bring
[1:12:59] the heat, you can bring the battle, but
[1:13:01] I already know where I came from. And
[1:13:03] now I know where I'm going. I know where
[1:13:05] I'll end up. I'm going to sit with him
[1:13:07] in his throne. I'm an overcomer in
[1:13:09] Leosa. I'm predestinated son and
[1:13:12] daughter of God.
[1:13:14] It holds you. That's what's got you.
[1:13:16] It's because you know your destination.
[1:13:18] Glory to God. Hallelujah. That's what's
[1:13:21] got you. Because you know your
[1:13:22] destination. You say, you know, see
[1:13:24] people that have so much struggle, they
[1:13:25] just don't know their destination yet.
[1:13:27] You know how people they they're so down
[1:13:29] all the time. They just don't know their
[1:13:30] destination yet. You take a man or a
[1:13:32] woman that finally has a revelation that
[1:13:34] they are predestinated by God and
[1:13:36] they're going to sit in the throne of
[1:13:37] God because they're living in the age of
[1:13:39] Leoa that God has already predetermined
[1:13:41] it and there ain't nothing going to
[1:13:43] hinder their re their arrival. Brother
[1:13:45] Mark, it'll put a revival in every heart
[1:13:48] to know that God has called me
[1:13:50] predestinated me before the foundation
[1:13:52] of the world. How many believes that we
[1:13:55] have a predetermined destination? Y'all
[1:13:56] ain't going to let me get to my thought.
[1:13:58] You have a predetermined destination.
[1:14:01] You are a part of the kingdom of God.
[1:14:04] You know what that means to me? That
[1:14:06] means that when you were in sin, you
[1:14:09] were a part of the kingdom of God. If
[1:14:11] you had a predetermined destination when
[1:14:14] you were lost, Brother Cody, you were a
[1:14:16] part of the kingdom of God. When you
[1:14:18] didn't know God, you know what, brother
[1:14:20] West? You were a part of the kingdom of
[1:14:22] God. I'll go as far as to say is the day
[1:14:24] you were born and your mama was packing
[1:14:26] around 7 and 12 pounds of the kingdom of
[1:14:28] God. You have always been a part of the
[1:14:31] kingdom of God. From the time you were
[1:14:33] born upon this earth, you were a part of
[1:14:34] God's kingdom. It is your destination.
[1:14:37] You were elected by God, chosen by God,
[1:14:40] predestinated by God to have an eternal
[1:14:42] destination. You say, "Brother man, I'm
[1:14:44] not sure about that." Well, the Bible is
[1:14:46] filled with stories of destiny. The
[1:14:49] whole Bible is filled with it. But I say
[1:14:51] this, not only do we have a destination,
[1:14:54] brother Mark, but or or have an eternal
[1:14:56] destination, but I believe that our
[1:14:57] destiny determines how that we even
[1:14:59] leave this earth. Whether we're going to
[1:15:01] leave by by the way of a grave or
[1:15:03] whether we leave by rapture, I believe
[1:15:04] that's predetermined. I believe God
[1:15:06] already knows the way you're going to
[1:15:07] leave this earth. How many believe that?
[1:15:09] My God's an eternal God. He already
[1:15:10] knows. We have a predetermined
[1:15:12] destination. We have a predetermined
[1:15:14] time of departure. Don't that make it a
[1:15:16] lot easier to live and not worry and
[1:15:18] fret about what tomorrow holds? We have
[1:15:20] a predetermined. It's our destiny how
[1:15:23] God's going to how God's going to take
[1:15:24] us. But you know what? I'll go a step
[1:15:26] further than that. I believe that God
[1:15:28] not only does he determine how we how
[1:15:30] you leave this earth, but I believe he
[1:15:31] determines how that you live on this
[1:15:34] earth. I believe that your destiny that
[1:15:36] God gave you determines how that you
[1:15:38] live while you're on the earth. I can
[1:15:40] prove that by the Bible. Look at the
[1:15:42] life of Joseph. He went from being an
[1:15:44] outcast in his family. Remember what the
[1:15:46] Bible said? He was his whole family
[1:15:48] kicked him out and his brothers, they
[1:15:49] didn't want to have nothing to do with
[1:15:50] him and they sold him. They sold him and
[1:15:52] kicked him out and he became a great
[1:15:54] leader of Egypt. He was sold into
[1:15:56] slavery and then risen into power. You
[1:15:59] say, "What was it?" It was his destiny.
[1:16:01] And because, think of it, why? Because
[1:16:03] he was born with a gift that God had
[1:16:05] given him. And that gift, it looked like
[1:16:07] that gift took him right to a pit. It
[1:16:09] looked like the gift put him in prison.
[1:16:11] It looked like the gift ended his life.
[1:16:13] It was a gift that maybe I shouldn't
[1:16:14] ever said anything about it, but let me
[1:16:16] tell you what it ultimately did. It
[1:16:18] brought a man to his destiny. God put
[1:16:21] something in his life that would bring
[1:16:22] him to his destiny upon this earth. He
[1:16:25] wasn't the only one God done it with. He
[1:16:27] done it with King David who was a
[1:16:29] shepherd boy living in a taking care of
[1:16:31] his father's sheep. But God took a
[1:16:33] shepherd and put him in the throne of a
[1:16:35] king because it was his destiny. What
[1:16:38] about Ruth? It was a poor Moabitis
[1:16:40] beggar that came in and was begging for
[1:16:42] scrap in the field of in the field of
[1:16:44] Boaz. But her destiny wouldn't remain to
[1:16:47] be a beggar or to be a Moabitis. But
[1:16:49] Boaz said, "I have purchased her. I
[1:16:51] bought her to be my wife. She took on
[1:16:54] the name of Boaz. She became a daughter
[1:16:56] of Israel. And she birthed the very son
[1:16:58] that would be the grandfather of King
[1:17:00] David. It was her destiny." Friends,
[1:17:04] I've got news for you. Walt Disney ain't
[1:17:06] got nothing on the Bible. Cinderella
[1:17:08] ain't got nothing on Queen Esther. How
[1:17:10] that she came from being a poor little
[1:17:12] Jewish girl that didn't have nothing.
[1:17:14] There wasn't nobody. But the king needed
[1:17:16] another wife. And he called out to the
[1:17:18] world said, "I'm going to have I'm going
[1:17:20] to have a contest to bring all of the
[1:17:22] bride, all the the girls to my place."
[1:17:25] And here, little Esther came there one
[1:17:27] day being led by Mori the Jew. And she
[1:17:30] went in and she dressed the way that was
[1:17:32] pleasing to the king. She got all
[1:17:34] dressed just right. She may not have had
[1:17:36] a glass slipper, but I got news for you.
[1:17:38] The slippers she wore were pleasing to
[1:17:40] the king. And when she went into the
[1:17:43] king's chamber, he saw her and it was
[1:17:45] love at first sight. It's the greatest
[1:17:47] love story that was ever written. I know
[1:17:50] what the scholars say. It's some
[1:17:51] fictional story, but I don't believe
[1:17:53] that. I believe it was a real story. I
[1:17:55] believe it was inspired by God and it
[1:17:57] was sent to inspire you this morning
[1:17:59] that it don't matter where you came
[1:18:01] from. that your destiny brought you to
[1:18:03] the throne of a king.
[1:18:07] She was poor. She had nothing. But her
[1:18:10] destiny gave her power to be able to
[1:18:12] stand in the gap for the entire nation
[1:18:14] of Israel.
[1:18:16] That was her destiny. Hallelujah. She
[1:18:20] saved a nation. It was her destiny.
[1:18:23] Brother Bam said there's many things
[1:18:25] that people are predestinated to. Yes,
[1:18:27] sir.
[1:18:29] He said, "See, there's people, this is
[1:18:32] sad, but there's people that will never
[1:18:34] be saved no matter what they do. You
[1:18:37] know that there's people that are
[1:18:39] predestinated to be lost. There's people
[1:18:41] that are predestinated to be saved. But
[1:18:44] all that's predestinated to be saved
[1:18:46] will be saved regardless."
[1:18:49] Isn't that good? No matter those that
[1:18:51] are predestinated to be lost, it don't
[1:18:52] matter what they do, they're always
[1:18:53] going to be lost. They can come to
[1:18:55] church. They can make believe. They can
[1:18:57] wear they can dress like you do, do all
[1:18:59] the things, but they're predestinated to
[1:19:00] be lost. I'm going to show you that in
[1:19:01] the Bible just a minute. But but if
[1:19:03] that's the case, then what about those
[1:19:04] that are predestinated to be saved. Said
[1:19:07] you will be saved regardless. As hard as
[1:19:09] they try to be and can't be is as hard
[1:19:11] as you try not to be and have to be.
[1:19:13] Hallelujah. You're predestinated to be
[1:19:15] saved. You can't be lost regardless.
[1:19:17] Why? Because you was predestinated. You
[1:19:19] say predestinated to be lost. That's
[1:19:20] what it's in the book of Jude the fourth
[1:19:22] verse. So there are certain men,
[1:19:23] remember it was men that denied the Lord
[1:19:25] Jesus Christ. Jude said there are
[1:19:26] certain men that crept in unaware who
[1:19:28] were before of old ordained to
[1:19:30] condemnation. In other words, they were
[1:19:32] predestinated of old to condemnation. So
[1:19:36] not only are we predestinated to eternal
[1:19:38] life, but listen what Paul says. He
[1:19:41] said, "Having predestinated us under the
[1:19:43] adoption of children by Jesus Christ
[1:19:45] unto himself." We've been predestinated
[1:19:48] unto the adoption of children. So we're
[1:19:50] not we're not we're not just talking
[1:19:51] about our destination said but our
[1:19:53] predestination our destiny has something
[1:19:56] to do with our life. How many believe
[1:19:58] that the adoption of children? You know,
[1:20:00] you remember you know what he's talking
[1:20:01] about. Remember in the old days of how
[1:20:02] that a son would be born and he was
[1:20:05] raised by a tutor in the house of his
[1:20:06] father and then that son because he
[1:20:09] would he would go and train him in the
[1:20:10] ways of dad and show him how dad handled
[1:20:12] his business and show him how to conduct
[1:20:15] himself and and so that this tutor would
[1:20:17] raise him and teach him and guide him
[1:20:18] and and then the the the father would
[1:20:20] call on the tutor every now and then and
[1:20:22] say, "How's my son coming along?" And
[1:20:24] you know what? The tutor was honest. He
[1:20:25] didn't hold nothing back. He he'd just
[1:20:27] go back and say, "Well, he's not doing
[1:20:28] very good right now. He he he's still
[1:20:30] he's still a kid. He he's still making a
[1:20:32] lot of kid mistakes. He's still doing
[1:20:33] doing a lot of things that you wouldn't
[1:20:35] be happy with." And so the father, he
[1:20:37] would just let him carry on under the
[1:20:38] tutor. But said, "That's what the Holy
[1:20:40] Spirit's doing with us right now. It's
[1:20:42] always bringing a report, showing the
[1:20:44] condition of the church and where we are
[1:20:46] with God." He said, you see, and he
[1:20:47] won't hold nothing back. The Holy Spirit
[1:20:49] don't pull strings or punches for
[1:20:50] anybody. It's going to bring the truth.
[1:20:53] And the father can never place him in a
[1:20:55] position like that because he's never
[1:20:57] got to the place that he could be in
[1:20:58] this position. So, but finally the young
[1:21:01] man comes to an age to where everything
[1:21:03] that he does is pleasing to the father.
[1:21:05] And when the Holy Spirit or when the
[1:21:07] tutor looks at the at the at the son,
[1:21:10] every time he looks at him, he sees the
[1:21:11] father. Everything he does, you know,
[1:21:13] you look just like your dad when you do
[1:21:15] that. You know, you act just like your
[1:21:16] dad. That's exactly how your dad would
[1:21:18] have done that. You know, you sound just
[1:21:20] like your dad when he What is he doing?
[1:21:21] He's waiting until he gets to the place
[1:21:24] that he's just like the father was.
[1:21:26] Says, see, and so when he would come to
[1:21:28] this age, then the father would see that
[1:21:29] the son had progressed. He was a worthy
[1:21:32] boy and everything he did was right and
[1:21:33] was right up with the father's business.
[1:21:35] See, he wanted everything just right for
[1:21:37] the father. And the son had no selfish
[1:21:39] motive at all. He only wanted what the
[1:21:41] father wanted. And when a son can get to
[1:21:44] that place that he only wants what the
[1:21:45] father wants and he's not after his own
[1:21:47] motive and he's not, you know, I I know
[1:21:49] how they say, well, you know, I I I want
[1:21:51] to do it do it my own way and I do it,
[1:21:53] you know, this ain't a Frank Sinatra
[1:21:55] song. This is God. This is the father
[1:21:57] calling us to be pleasing unto the
[1:21:59] father. We're not trying to do
[1:22:00] everything our own way. He said, but but
[1:22:03] it was right for the father. He had no
[1:22:04] selfish motives. But the father then
[1:22:06] took the son out into a public place.
[1:22:09] And when he took the son, he was the
[1:22:11] father would take his own son that was
[1:22:12] born into his family and he would
[1:22:14] publicly adopt him before all the
[1:22:16] people. He'd put a robe on him. He'd put
[1:22:19] his ring, his signature. In other words,
[1:22:21] he would make it public so that the that
[1:22:23] the boy now had the ability to do what
[1:22:26] the do what the father had done. In
[1:22:28] other words, the son, you think about
[1:22:30] the son's name on the check was just as
[1:22:32] good as the father's because he was
[1:22:34] placed in his position. Brother said he
[1:22:35] he placed his son positionally. And when
[1:22:38] he put him in his position, he said,
[1:22:39] "Then he would be able to do the very
[1:22:41] thing of the father." His name was just
[1:22:42] as good as the father's name. And notice
[1:22:44] what he done. He done it publicly. You
[1:22:46] say, "Well, why would the father adopt
[1:22:48] him publicly?" Well, let me tell you. It
[1:22:50] was so that all of the merchants and all
[1:22:52] of the people in the land would
[1:22:54] recognize that the son had the power
[1:22:56] that the father had. And so, in all of
[1:22:59] all the people that were invited and all
[1:23:01] the public and all the merchants around,
[1:23:03] he said, "I want you to know that I've
[1:23:04] given my signature to this boy. And when
[1:23:06] he comes into your shop and he needs
[1:23:08] something and he signs it, it's as good
[1:23:10] as me putting my name on the check. It's
[1:23:12] a place of adoption. So he made a public
[1:23:15] adoption that he could go, "Glory to
[1:23:16] God." He made a public adoption that he
[1:23:19] would have the ability. He said, "See,
[1:23:20] the son's name is just as good as the
[1:23:22] father's name." Now he said, "Brother B
[1:23:24] said, I hope you're getting this." He
[1:23:25] places his son in his position. Isn't
[1:23:28] that what God done whenever Jesus had
[1:23:30] had done everything that was pleasing to
[1:23:33] the father? Remember what God done? He
[1:23:35] took him up on Mount Transfiguration. He
[1:23:37] was doing the work of the father. It was
[1:23:39] pleasing to the father. He was about the
[1:23:41] father's business. He had no agenda on
[1:23:43] his own. He wouldn't even go pray for
[1:23:45] somebody without a vision, without
[1:23:47] knowing it was the will of the father.
[1:23:48] He wouldn't cast out devils without
[1:23:50] knowing it was the will of the father.
[1:23:52] Everything he done was about the
[1:23:54] father's business. And what god is he
[1:23:56] led him up on mount transfiguration
[1:23:58] right on a mountain between heaven and
[1:24:00] earth. So what was he doing? He was
[1:24:03] trying to make a witness to everybody.
[1:24:05] And let me tell you what happened.
[1:24:06] Because it was the son of God, he
[1:24:08] brought witnesses from earth and
[1:24:09] witnesses from heaven to witness what
[1:24:12] God was about to do. He called Peter and
[1:24:14] James and John that were a part of the
[1:24:16] families of the earth. But then out of
[1:24:18] heaven, he called Moses and Elijah that
[1:24:21] came right down to that mount. I I can
[1:24:22] just see Moses being called, "Hey,
[1:24:24] Elijah, where you heading? I we're going
[1:24:26] back down to the earth. Well, what are
[1:24:27] we doing on the earth?" I don't know. I
[1:24:29] got an invitation. Well, what's your
[1:24:30] invitation say? It says, "I was invited
[1:24:33] to an adoption ceremony." Here they come
[1:24:35] down. You say, "What were they coming
[1:24:37] to?" They were coming to watch the
[1:24:38] adoption of the son of God. He said, "He
[1:24:41] went up on that mountain, took a witness
[1:24:43] from heaven and earth, and he took his
[1:24:45] only beloved son, and stood him out
[1:24:47] before the earth, the witnesses of
[1:24:49] heaven, and he glorified him, and his
[1:24:51] raignment became white as the light." He
[1:24:53] said, "That's the royal robe, the same
[1:24:56] as the father of the Old Testament." He
[1:24:58] placed it on his son and he stood before
[1:25:00] the crowd adopted and he placed his son
[1:25:03] positionally over everything that the
[1:25:05] father had. God took his own son with
[1:25:08] witnesses of heaven and earth on Mount
[1:25:10] Transfiguration and placed him and then
[1:25:12] God said, "This is my beloved son." No
[1:25:15] wonder he said that. It was an adoption
[1:25:17] ceremony. This is my beloved son in whom
[1:25:20] I am well pleased. Hear ye him.
[1:25:25] said, "See, then the son was an heir to
[1:25:28] all that the father had." He said,
[1:25:30] "Brother Matt, well, that's wonderful,
[1:25:31] but what about us? Can I go a step
[1:25:33] further?" Said, "Brother M said, here we
[1:25:35] are." He said, "We are we are just as
[1:25:37] God what God has. We are joint hes with
[1:25:40] Christ." See, we're we are called. And
[1:25:43] listen what Paul said. Not maybe,
[1:25:47] but you were predestinated
[1:25:49] to be sons of God. predestinated to the
[1:25:53] adoption of the sons of God. Think about
[1:25:56] it here in our life. We the Holy Spirit,
[1:25:58] it will lead you and guide you. It it'll
[1:26:00] bring you into a position of power. It's
[1:26:02] that same Holy Ghost that brings you to
[1:26:04] a place of adoption. And friends, I know
[1:26:06] this. I I know that there's coming a
[1:26:08] time when we'll see the fullness of
[1:26:10] adoption. I I know what the Bible says
[1:26:11] that the whole earth is waiting and
[1:26:13] groaning and waiting on the
[1:26:14] manifestation of the sons of God. But
[1:26:16] that doesn't mean that you're not an
[1:26:18] adopted son of God right now. You may
[1:26:20] not have received the fullness you the
[1:26:22] changing of this body, but that don't
[1:26:24] mean you're not an adopted son. I I can
[1:26:25] prove that. When when brother Brandon
[1:26:27] was preaching the message, the Queen of
[1:26:28] Sheba, he was at he was at a woman
[1:26:30] coming in the prayer line and she she
[1:26:32] stood before him and and he starts
[1:26:34] talking to her. He said, "The Lord
[1:26:35] Jesus, do I have a minute? I don't know
[1:26:37] what the time." He said, "The Lord Jesus
[1:26:39] will reveal something to you." He said
[1:26:40] that you don't know that you know I
[1:26:42] don't know nothing about you but if the
[1:26:44] Lord Jesus will reveal something to me
[1:26:46] that you that you know it has to come
[1:26:48] supernatural would it make you believe
[1:26:50] better? She said it would. He said would
[1:26:52] it make the audience believe better? He
[1:26:53] said now she's close to me here just
[1:26:55] real close here. He is standing in this
[1:26:57] in this building preaching this Queen of
[1:26:59] Sheba. At the end the woman comes to the
[1:27:01] prayer line. So he said here we are
[1:27:03] she's standing real close to me and then
[1:27:05] his mind goes back to John the 4th
[1:27:07] chapter. He said, 'You know, it reminds
[1:27:09] me of a time when a man stood by another
[1:27:11] man stood by another woman. They were
[1:27:13] sitting that she was sitting by a well
[1:27:15] and he be to discern her heart and tell
[1:27:16] her the things of her heart. He said,
[1:27:18] "It reminds me of a time when a woman
[1:27:20] met another man for the first time."
[1:27:22] Here he was s standing before this woman
[1:27:24] said, "I've never met you. Do you know
[1:27:25] me?" No, I don't know you, but it
[1:27:27] reminds me of a time when a man met
[1:27:29] another woman for the first time. He
[1:27:31] said, "Now you're not that woman and I'm
[1:27:33] not that man." He said, "But his spirit
[1:27:35] still lives." Hallelujah. And in that
[1:27:38] time it was in the flesh. In that time
[1:27:40] it was in the flesh called the son of
[1:27:42] God. But now we are adopted sons of God
[1:27:46] by his grace so that his work can carry
[1:27:48] on and it can still be declared.
[1:27:52] We are adopted sons of God. Then he be
[1:27:54] to talk to this woman to prove what an
[1:27:56] adopted son of God was. He said, "This
[1:27:58] lady's very sick. She's got female
[1:28:00] trouble. Ladies trouble. If that's
[1:28:01] right, raise up your hand. You believe
[1:28:02] now?" She raised up her hand. He said,
[1:28:04] "I keep feeling somebody saying he's
[1:28:07] guessing that. Would you please stop
[1:28:08] doing that? You're hurting the meeting.
[1:28:11] I'm not guessing that. It's the power of
[1:28:13] God here. Still here." He said, "Now
[1:28:16] just stand still just a minute." So here
[1:28:18] he discerns this woman. You've got this
[1:28:20] trouble. She says, "That's right." Then
[1:28:22] all of a sudden stops and says,
[1:28:23] "Somebody keeps thinking I'm guessing
[1:28:25] that and I'm not guessing that. Let me
[1:28:27] you're you're hindering the meeting by
[1:28:29] not having faith, by being an
[1:28:30] unbeliever, by being a critic, by being
[1:28:32] a skeptic, but but if you'll just enter
[1:28:34] in. Let Let me stop here just a minute.
[1:28:37] He said, he said, I he said you're
[1:28:39] that's the power of God. He said, stand
[1:28:40] here just a minute. Let's see. Now, I
[1:28:43] don't know what it was, but just a
[1:28:44] minute. Hang on. Yes, ma'am. You've been
[1:28:47] to a doctor. It was a female. Yeah. Not
[1:28:49] only that, he said, "You're up for an
[1:28:51] operation. Is that right? You're about
[1:28:52] to You're having kidney trouble. You're
[1:28:54] having bladder trouble. Matter of fact,
[1:28:56] you're not even from this country.
[1:28:58] You're from up in Missouri. Is that
[1:28:59] right? Your name is Miss Hilddrth. Is
[1:29:01] that right? Now, go back home and be
[1:29:03] made well in the name of the Lord. And
[1:29:05] then there's question marks. Question
[1:29:07] marks because you can't hear what he's
[1:29:08] saying because the audience makes too
[1:29:10] much noise.
[1:29:12] But he was manifesting
[1:29:17] the very power of God. He said, "Your
[1:29:19] faith has made you whole." The same
[1:29:21] words that Jesus would say. Just believe
[1:29:23] that with all your heart. So, see, so
[1:29:25] here I you say, "Well, brother Matt,
[1:29:27] that was brother Brandon, but what about
[1:29:29] us?" Well, you realize he wasn't just
[1:29:30] speaking of himself here in Jesus Christ
[1:29:32] the same yesterday, today, and forever.
[1:29:34] He said he was the son of God, but we
[1:29:37] are adopted sons and daughters of God.
[1:29:41] So, it wasn't just wasn't just him, but
[1:29:43] we are adopted even now. We are adopted
[1:29:45] sons and daughters of God. That means
[1:29:47] the same God that was in Jesus is the
[1:29:49] same God today. Jesus said, "The works
[1:29:52] that I do shall you do also." Abraham
[1:29:54] said, "The pillar of fire that's been
[1:29:56] identified scientifically by reaction
[1:29:58] and character and everything else is
[1:30:00] just the same as it was when it was
[1:30:02] dwelling in the body of God's only
[1:30:04] begotten son, it does the same thing as
[1:30:07] it dwells in the body of his adopted
[1:30:09] sons in the last day." So the same
[1:30:12] pillar of fire that was in the man Jesus
[1:30:14] Christ that done the very works of Jesus
[1:30:16] Christ. He said that same pillar of fire
[1:30:18] that was in the son of God is in the
[1:30:20] adopted sons of God still manifesting
[1:30:23] Jesus Christ today.
[1:30:26] We've been positionally placed in the
[1:30:27] body as adopted sons and daughters.
[1:30:30] Somebody say hallelujah. Hallelujah. I
[1:30:32] said how many's found their place in the
[1:30:33] body as adopted sons and daughters of
[1:30:36] God? I know what happens whenever you
[1:30:37] get to preaching this. People get it all
[1:30:39] mixed up and they think because I'm an
[1:30:40] adopted son now I got to do what brother
[1:30:42] Brandham done. Hello, that ain't it.
[1:30:44] They think in order to have that they
[1:30:46] got they got to they got to have that
[1:30:47] gift. But you realize that the gift was
[1:30:49] not on display to vindicate what an
[1:30:51] adopted son was. It was that particular
[1:30:53] adopted son in his position.
[1:30:56] But we are not in the position of a
[1:30:58] prophet of God. We are some in a
[1:31:00] position of pastors, evangelists,
[1:31:02] teachers, uh uh preachers. Some have
[1:31:05] gifts of healing. We we all we all have
[1:31:07] have different positions that God has
[1:31:09] placed us in in the body. But and so
[1:31:11] that don't give us the the the the the
[1:31:13] gift that brother Brandham have when
[1:31:14] people people I don't want to get in it,
[1:31:16] but man, when people it just it makes me
[1:31:18] sick to my stomach to watch a man try to
[1:31:20] imitate brother Brandham's gift and and
[1:31:22] get a bunch of details
[1:31:24] from people and stand on a on a stage
[1:31:27] stand on a stage and and begin to to try
[1:31:30] to discern people like that. Half the
[1:31:32] time get it right, half the time get it
[1:31:33] wrong. and and and all they have to do
[1:31:35] is just preach the message of the hour
[1:31:37] and let the message have its power. We
[1:31:40] don't have to do that. We're not trying
[1:31:41] to build a church. We're not trying to
[1:31:43] build a name or a ministry or to
[1:31:48] that ain't our calling. That ain't our
[1:31:50] that ain't our position there. That that
[1:31:52] that gift was sent one to an age. That
[1:31:55] otherwise if everybody could do that, we
[1:31:57] wouldn't know who to follow. Do you
[1:31:59] realize why God would do that? He sent
[1:32:00] it as a messenger to the church. Not not
[1:32:03] messengers. It wasn't plural. It was a
[1:32:04] messenger of the church of Leodysia. He
[1:32:07] was sent with a gift to turn That's
[1:32:09] right. back to God. So, see, so that
[1:32:12] that that what that was that was him in
[1:32:14] his position. But that don't mean that
[1:32:16] every one of us don't possess a power.
[1:32:18] Said we possess the power to overcome
[1:32:20] the world as believers. We possess the
[1:32:23] power to overcome devils. Even the Bible
[1:32:25] said, "These signs shall follow them
[1:32:27] that believe." Here's your power. They
[1:32:29] shall lay hands on the sick and they
[1:32:31] shall recover. any they shall they shall
[1:32:34] cast out devils in my name. Every one of
[1:32:36] us, we possess the faith to be healed
[1:32:39] because you've been predestinated to
[1:32:41] adoption. Amen. Adoption didn't make you
[1:32:44] a prophet. It made you an adopted son of
[1:32:46] God in your position. That's right. But
[1:32:49] as a believer, you got a right to heal.
[1:32:50] You got a right to have faith. You got a
[1:32:52] right to have power with the devil. You
[1:32:53] got a right to put him in his place.
[1:32:56] Every one of us, some of us have gifts
[1:32:57] to sing. And I can say it. Y'all don't
[1:32:59] get mad at me. But some of us don't.
[1:33:03] Some people do. Some people have gift to
[1:33:05] preach. Some of us don't. Everybody
[1:33:07] don't have the same gift.
[1:33:09] See, some people in your gift, it it
[1:33:12] moves people. It moves the the church.
[1:33:15] And and if it don't, maybe it wasn't a
[1:33:17] gift.
[1:33:20] So, it's a gift that God gives to the
[1:33:21] body. He puts us all in our position as
[1:33:24] as members of the body of Christ. Says,
[1:33:27] "See, God knew every Think about it. He
[1:33:29] knew everything about you from the very
[1:33:31] beginning. He knew you. Knew where you
[1:33:34] came from. By election, he chose you.
[1:33:35] Predestination will be our destiny. He
[1:33:38] said in the very beginning, we came from
[1:33:40] the dust of the earth. Our bodies laid
[1:33:42] out in this earth at the beginning. So,
[1:33:45] let's take a little picture like this.
[1:33:46] God, the fountain of all life, the logos
[1:33:49] that went out of God, it brooded over
[1:33:51] the earth. Isn't that powerful? That
[1:33:53] whenever God created in the beginning
[1:33:55] and said, "Let there be." And that great
[1:33:57] logos came out from God that it would
[1:33:59] take that earth and it be to brood over
[1:34:01] the earth. He said everything that we
[1:34:03] are that we come out of the dust our
[1:34:05] bodies was laying in that earth. See
[1:34:07] what was it brooding over? He was
[1:34:09] brooding o brooding over you and I hear
[1:34:11] that logos of God. He was watching over
[1:34:14] his pre he's predestinated seed. He was
[1:34:16] watching over that that that elected
[1:34:19] seed of God. He said our bodies laying
[1:34:21] in the earth. He was brooding over the
[1:34:22] earth watching over it like a mother
[1:34:24] couping. He said, "My body was laid out
[1:34:26] in this earth before there was ever even
[1:34:28] life on the earth. Our bodies were
[1:34:30] laying the earth, the calcium,
[1:34:32] petroleum, and stuff." God was a
[1:34:33] contractor. He laid out our bodies just
[1:34:35] like he was going to build a
[1:34:36] subdivision. He know we'd be here. He
[1:34:38] knowed I'd be in the world before the
[1:34:40] world. He knowed I'd be standing here
[1:34:42] and what there was a world here. He
[1:34:44] knowed you'd be sitting in the seat you
[1:34:46] are. He's infinite. He knows you. So,
[1:34:48] what do you got to be scared about? We
[1:34:50] were laying in the earth before the
[1:34:52] before before you were ever born. Before
[1:34:54] there was ever before God ever made
[1:34:56] Adam, every part of you was laying in
[1:34:58] the earth already. Ain't that powerful
[1:35:00] that God saw you in as a contractor that
[1:35:03] God would walk around the earth. One day
[1:35:04] I'm going to take that and that and that
[1:35:06] and I'm going to make Wesley Hams and
[1:35:07] one day I'm going to take that and that.
[1:35:09] I'm going to make Charles Donson. One
[1:35:10] day I'm going to take that and that and
[1:35:12] I'm going to make Debbie Roberts. You
[1:35:13] know, I'm going to build them. It was
[1:35:15] God. It was us laying in the earth in
[1:35:17] God's creation. and he brooded it over
[1:35:19] his creation that one day he could
[1:35:22] create the very image out of his mind.
[1:35:24] He could manifest it upon the earth and
[1:35:26] then you would grow up. You'd get all
[1:35:27] wrecked up in the world. But God wasn't
[1:35:29] done with you because you was elected of
[1:35:31] God. He was chosen by God before the
[1:35:34] foundation of the world. He said, "But
[1:35:35] then I'm going to take his life." If God
[1:35:37] has the ability to make you, he has the
[1:35:39] ability to shape you. He's got the
[1:35:41] ability to cleanse you, to sanctify you,
[1:35:44] to wash you, to pick you up, to
[1:35:46] establish you, to set you upon the word
[1:35:48] of God. He saw it all from the
[1:35:50] beginning. So that means it don't matter
[1:35:52] how you were born. God saw it from the
[1:35:55] beginning. Isn't that powerful? We look
[1:35:58] at our life and all of our weakness and
[1:36:00] all of our failures, but it don't
[1:36:01] matter. All of that don't matter. God
[1:36:03] saw you from the beginning. Laying in
[1:36:06] the earth, he brewed it over it knowing
[1:36:09] what he would create. So no matter how
[1:36:11] you came into this earth, you know, it
[1:36:14] makes me think about that blind man in
[1:36:16] John the 9th chapter. Remember remember
[1:36:18] what he was when Jesus walked by here, a
[1:36:21] man that had been blind from his birth.
[1:36:24] He was born without eyes in his socket.
[1:36:27] And the disciples said, "Master, who did
[1:36:29] sin that would cause this man to be born
[1:36:31] blind?" And Jesus said, "Nobody sinned.
[1:36:34] It wasn't him or his parents." He said
[1:36:36] he he but he was only born this way that
[1:36:39] the works of God would be made manifest
[1:36:41] in him.
[1:36:43] He was born in this condition that the
[1:36:46] works of God could be manifested. You
[1:36:48] realize that man in his blind condition
[1:36:50] that he could be so easily misled,
[1:36:53] easily deceived. I I just I just think
[1:36:55] about how that in this his entire life
[1:36:57] of being blind and maybe you know the
[1:37:00] young kids in school how they maybe kind
[1:37:02] of picked on him a little bit and you
[1:37:03] know tap and run around how you know all
[1:37:05] the things that people do that are that
[1:37:07] are cruel. Maybe he went through a lot
[1:37:09] of those things and persecutions and you
[1:37:11] know anybody could mislead him and say
[1:37:13] this is the way to the temple or this is
[1:37:15] the way to your house or this is a
[1:37:17] shortcut you should go this way. You
[1:37:19] know, maybe this boy had been misled so
[1:37:21] many times in his life because he was
[1:37:23] blind and he could not see. He could be
[1:37:25] so easily led astray because he had no
[1:37:28] eyes and this way, that way, easily. But
[1:37:31] then when Jesus came, Jesus came for one
[1:37:34] purpose. He came to open his eyes that
[1:37:36] he could see for himself. And when he
[1:37:39] came and he found that man, I love what
[1:37:40] Jesus done. The Bible says that he
[1:37:42] reached down into the dust of the ground
[1:37:44] and he picked up dirt and he anointed it
[1:37:47] and he and he made clay out of it. I
[1:37:49] thought my here that very creator that
[1:37:52] had made that man in the beginning, the
[1:37:54] very one that brooded over the earth
[1:37:56] that saw all of our bodies laying upon
[1:37:58] the earth and calcium and pod ash and
[1:38:00] all the parts of us laying on the earth.
[1:38:02] When God created that man, isn't that
[1:38:04] what the Bible says, Jeremiah? He said,
[1:38:05] "When God made me," he said, "I knew you
[1:38:07] before I ever knitted you together in
[1:38:10] your mother's womb." It was God that
[1:38:12] formed us in the womb of our mother.
[1:38:14] Here, whenever God made that man, and he
[1:38:16] begin to create him, I could just see
[1:38:18] God up there whenever he was making that
[1:38:20] man in the very beginning, and he was
[1:38:21] forming him in his mother's womb, and he
[1:38:23] would pick up the parts and and he was
[1:38:25] begin to form his body and maybe he
[1:38:27] would pick up what would be his eyes and
[1:38:29] say, "No, you know what? I'm going to
[1:38:30] leave that down there. I'm going to I'll
[1:38:32] pick that up on another day." And so the
[1:38:34] man was formed in his mother's womb. And
[1:38:36] he was born into this earth miserable
[1:38:38] and naked and blind and didn't even know
[1:38:41] it. And when he came out of the womb of
[1:38:43] his mother, brother Mark, he went
[1:38:44] through time after time after age, being
[1:38:47] lost and led astray and didn't know
[1:38:49] which way to turn until one day Jesus
[1:38:52] came and crossed his path. He said,
[1:38:54] "This man has not sinned. He was born
[1:38:56] this way that the works of God might be
[1:38:58] made manifest in him. And he rested down
[1:39:01] in the earth. and he took the very parts
[1:39:04] of him. I believe it was the same part
[1:39:06] that God would have used in the
[1:39:07] beginning. I believe he was standing in
[1:39:09] the same place that his body was laying
[1:39:11] before the world ever began. And Jesus
[1:39:13] picked up that part of him and the
[1:39:15] master, the creator began to form. He
[1:39:17] said, "Now's the time to put the eyes in
[1:39:19] his socket." And Jesus be to form his
[1:39:23] eyes and he made them so perfectly
[1:39:25] placed that in anointing in his eyes. He
[1:39:27] said, "Now you go wash in the pool of
[1:39:29] Salom." You know what the Bible says?
[1:39:31] That the man, he made his way to the
[1:39:33] pool and he washed and he came back
[1:39:37] seeing.
[1:39:39] Hallelujah. You realize what God done?
[1:39:41] He put the finishing touches on his
[1:39:43] creation. And the man, he came back
[1:39:46] seeing. You see, see, it was God. Think
[1:39:48] about it. It was God that formed him. It
[1:39:50] was God that that picked him up. It was
[1:39:52] God that that that made him. And he
[1:39:54] waited till the right time. He You say,
[1:39:57] "Well, why was he in that condition to
[1:39:58] begin with?" that Jesus said, "I'm going
[1:39:59] to show you why that the works of God
[1:40:01] could be made manifest. Not from their
[1:40:04] not from their sin, not not from his
[1:40:06] mistakes, but that the works of God
[1:40:08] could be made manifest." Why are they
[1:40:10] blind? Why is he wretched? Why did he
[1:40:12] come in the world this way? That the
[1:40:14] works of God could be made manifest to
[1:40:16] prove that the creator was still
[1:40:18] standing in our midst. See, that's what
[1:40:21] happened to that man and that blind man.
[1:40:24] But can I tell you this today? That's
[1:40:26] what happened to the church today. In
[1:40:28] the end time, the church was blind,
[1:40:32] miserable, poor, wretched, and naked.
[1:40:36] You say, "Why was she blind? Why was the
[1:40:39] church in this condition? Why am I born
[1:40:41] and lay out to see her? Why is the
[1:40:43] church in this condition?" Can I just
[1:40:44] say this? That the glory of God might be
[1:40:47] revealed in her. That the creator could
[1:40:50] stand in the presence of the church of
[1:40:51] the living God. Don't you realize what
[1:40:53] you were born in this world? You were
[1:40:55] born in this age blind. Hello somebody.
[1:40:58] Every one of us. We were born in this
[1:41:00] age blind where we could be led astray.
[1:41:02] The church had found itself in a
[1:41:04] condition. The church of Leoa was born
[1:41:06] in this age as a blind, wretched,
[1:41:09] miserable creature that didn't even know
[1:41:11] it. That could be led astray. That could
[1:41:12] be led from one doctrine to another,
[1:41:14] from one church to another, one
[1:41:16] denomination to another. Just led
[1:41:18] astray. had no idea which way to turn
[1:41:20] until God came down and Jesus came step
[1:41:24] right in front of the church again. And
[1:41:25] when he saw it in his condition, you
[1:41:27] say, "Why is the church in that
[1:41:29] condition that the works of God could be
[1:41:31] made manifest in her?" You say, "Well,
[1:41:33] what did he do?" Well, he had to give
[1:41:34] the church some eyesight. So, you know
[1:41:36] where he went to find it? He didn't send
[1:41:38] an angel out of heaven to lead the
[1:41:39] church. He didn't create it out of thin
[1:41:41] air. It wasn't Gabriel that came down
[1:41:44] that God felt down into the dust to the
[1:41:46] ground and he picked up dirt or clay.
[1:41:48] You know what clay is? It's a type of
[1:41:50] human flesh. So God was going to have to
[1:41:52] give eyesight to the church. He didn't
[1:41:54] do it by an angel from heaven. He done
[1:41:56] it by an angel from the earth. And he
[1:41:58] took that clay of a prophet of God and
[1:42:01] he put it in the socket of a blind
[1:42:03] church that it could lead the church out
[1:42:05] of its condition. Now go wash in the
[1:42:07] pool of Salom. Let me tell you something
[1:42:10] about that pool of Salom. When you went
[1:42:12] down to the pool, you realize that that
[1:42:13] pool had three tiers. It was that way
[1:42:15] for flooding in Israel or in Jerusalem
[1:42:17] whenever the floods would come. So there
[1:42:19] was three sets of steps that went down.
[1:42:21] There was a first level or the first
[1:42:23] pool. There was a second level or the
[1:42:25] second pool and then there was the
[1:42:26] bottom level which was the third pool.
[1:42:28] But in the normal water level, then that
[1:42:31] blind man would had to go all the way
[1:42:33] down the first set of steps, past the
[1:42:35] first pool, all the way down the second
[1:42:37] set of step, past the second pool, all
[1:42:39] the way down the third set of steps to
[1:42:41] get all the way down to the water of
[1:42:43] Saleom. And when he put it on his eyes,
[1:42:46] he received his healing. Friends, I got
[1:42:48] news for you. That's what happened to
[1:42:49] this church today. It couldn't this the
[1:42:51] the first pull never opened the church's
[1:42:53] eyes. It may have healed people. That's
[1:42:55] what the first pull was. It was healing,
[1:42:57] but it didn't open the church's eyes.
[1:42:59] The second pull, it didn't open their
[1:43:00] eyes. But the third pull is what it took
[1:43:03] for the eyes of the church to come open.
[1:43:06] The pool.
[1:43:09] The third pull opened the eyes. Brother
[1:43:11] said the first pull was healing. Second
[1:43:12] pool was prophesying, but the third pull
[1:43:14] was the opening of the word. The
[1:43:16] mysteries revealed. No more is there no
[1:43:18] higher order to reveal the word than
[1:43:20] prophets. By the only way the prophet
[1:43:22] can be vindicated is by the word. And
[1:43:24] remember, the third pull was the opening
[1:43:27] of the seven seals to reveal the hidden
[1:43:29] truth that's been sealed in the word. In
[1:43:33] other words, it would take that third
[1:43:34] pull to take this spiritual blindness
[1:43:37] off of the church. And friends, I've got
[1:43:39] news for you. When they went down there
[1:43:41] and dipped in that pool, the Bible says
[1:43:43] the man, I love it. I'll just read it
[1:43:45] simple. And he came seeing.
[1:43:50] Let that sink in. He went blind, but he
[1:43:53] came seeing. Here you can I tell you
[1:43:56] something else that God anointed his
[1:43:58] eyes and put his eyes in position before
[1:44:00] he could ever see. Amen. He anointed the
[1:44:03] clay and put the clay in its position.
[1:44:06] But the man still couldn't see. It took
[1:44:08] him going all the way down to the bottom
[1:44:10] of that pool before his eyes came open.
[1:44:13] That's what happened to the church. The
[1:44:15] church is born in this condition that
[1:44:18] the works of God could be ma made
[1:44:20] manifest. You know what happened after
[1:44:22] his vision was restored? His new eyes
[1:44:25] begin to reveal everything that he
[1:44:27] didn't used to understand.
[1:44:29] My you can imagine how he used to he
[1:44:30] used to have to think about things but
[1:44:32] never could get a clear picture. But now
[1:44:34] because of his eyes he could look to the
[1:44:36] temple and say that's the temple. He had
[1:44:38] nothing to compare it to. He just took
[1:44:40] what men said and this is what it looks
[1:44:42] like. He had he had no way to see color.
[1:44:44] A blind man born blind. Well, he don't
[1:44:45] know what a color is. He has no way to
[1:44:47] see color. He don't what what a sad
[1:44:50] thought that it is. He but now because
[1:44:52] his eyes were open he could say that's
[1:44:53] the temple that's a house that's an
[1:44:55] olive tree my that my not not how I had
[1:44:58] it pictured at all but but but it's
[1:45:00] clear now why because he was looking
[1:45:02] through eyes that's what God gave to the
[1:45:04] church a vision to the church that it
[1:45:07] could see clearly that it wouldn't be no
[1:45:09] spiritually blind bunch of people where
[1:45:12] but we've been given a vision through
[1:45:13] the through a prophetic eye brother Mark
[1:45:15] that we've been given a vision of of a
[1:45:17] new Jerusalem we've been we we know what
[1:45:19] the millennium looks like through a
[1:45:21] prophetic eye. We know when he went
[1:45:23] beyond the curtain of time, we know that
[1:45:25] people aren't floating around on no
[1:45:26] clouds over there with angel's wings
[1:45:28] fluttering by one another. He said, "But
[1:45:30] I stood there and I shook their hand and
[1:45:31] they hugged my neck and they they called
[1:45:33] me brother. They knew me and I knew I
[1:45:36] knew them. They they they were they were
[1:45:38] they were children. They were they were
[1:45:39] men just like you and I. But we know
[1:45:41] that because of a prophetic vision that
[1:45:45] God has given to the church. We're no
[1:45:46] longer blind. He gave the bride body.
[1:45:48] We're not walking around blind any
[1:45:50] longer. But he gave us a vision of our
[1:45:52] future home. How many believe that? The
[1:45:56] vision has been restored to the church.
[1:45:58] Let me tell you what that vision done.
[1:46:00] But Mark here, it took away the misery
[1:46:03] away from the church. It clothed her
[1:46:06] with righteousness. This is the very
[1:46:09] message of the hour. Clothe her with
[1:46:12] righteousness and brought a revival to a
[1:46:14] lukewarm church.
[1:46:17] called us out of that whole condition of
[1:46:19] Leodysia. As you stand to your feet this
[1:46:21] morning, this is what God done
[1:46:26] to manifest the works of God.
[1:46:30] We can't help the way we we were born
[1:46:32] and what condition we were born in or
[1:46:35] the age that we were born in. You
[1:46:37] realize none of us had any control over
[1:46:38] that at all.
[1:46:41] You might have picked a different day to
[1:46:42] be born on than June 29th, but Sister
[1:46:45] Leah, God had other choices. This is the
[1:46:48] day you was born. Happy birthday.
[1:46:51] You didn't choose your day of being born
[1:46:54] or the age you were born or but we were
[1:46:56] born in an age of spiritual blindness.
[1:46:59] Leysia, the church in the worst
[1:47:01] condition that it would ever be.
[1:47:03] You say, "Well, then there was no
[1:47:05] revival." But listen, there is a
[1:47:07] revival. may not be in the church, but
[1:47:10] it's in the bride. That's what
[1:47:12] Revelations 18 said, "Come out of her,
[1:47:13] my people." The message of this an angel
[1:47:17] would be to call a bride out of a church
[1:47:19] and put a revival back in her heart.
[1:47:21] That those that were standing there
[1:47:23] 2,000 years ago in the upper room ain't
[1:47:25] no different than you and I. A body of
[1:47:28] believers, if you could see them today,
[1:47:30] if they were standing in this room, that
[1:47:31] they're just like you and I were. A body
[1:47:33] of believers is filled with the Holy
[1:47:35] Ghost, that love God. They love their
[1:47:37] They love the message that that God
[1:47:40] brought to them. They That church in
[1:47:41] Ephesus, they love what Apostle Paul
[1:47:43] preached and established them in the
[1:47:45] word of God. They no different. They're
[1:47:48] they're message believers of their age.
[1:47:50] We're message believers of our age. And
[1:47:52] one day we're all going to the same
[1:47:54] destination. Do you believe that this
[1:47:56] morning? How many believes that? Say
[1:47:58] amen.
[1:48:00] Amen. Let's just bow our heads together.
[1:48:04] Gracious heavenly father, Lord, we just
[1:48:06] thank you,
[1:48:08] Lord, that you would take our life,
[1:48:10] Lord. And God, knowing that we don't
[1:48:14] have the ability to
[1:48:17] do all the things that we want to do
[1:48:18] sometimes. And Lord, we often look at
[1:48:22] the weaknesses of our flesh.
[1:48:25] But Lord, we just thank you that you
[1:48:26] would call us in this hour. Lord, I
[1:48:29] thank you for the day that you allowed
[1:48:30] us to live in. God, you called us for
[1:48:33] this age and told us and declared it
[1:48:35] that it would be a a great age and great
[1:48:37] battle, but there would be a people that
[1:48:39] would overcome it. And Lord, I thank
[1:48:40] you, Lord, that you had opened our eyes
[1:48:42] in this hour, God, that we could be able
[1:48:44] to stand upon the word of God, that we
[1:48:47] could manifest your works, Lord, and we
[1:48:49] could declare just like that blind man,
[1:48:52] Lord, that we could declare before
[1:48:54] before the the theologian or the
[1:48:56] Pharisee that all I know is I once was
[1:48:59] blind, but now I see. There was a man
[1:49:02] named Jesus that he came and he opened
[1:49:04] my eyes. Lord, we just thank you for it
[1:49:06] today. Lord, we thank you for this word.
[1:49:09] Ask Lord that it would find its resting
[1:49:10] place now in Jesus Christ's name we
[1:49:13] pray. Amen.
[1:49:16] Amen. You love the Lord this morning. He
[1:49:18] came looking for me.
[1:49:22] One night while on life's rage and see
[1:49:27] it looked as if I would suffer defeat.
[1:49:32] Darkness of night closed off with light.
[1:49:37] My heart sank with fear.
[1:49:42] My desperate cry
[1:49:45] bring out with pride. All I could see
[1:49:49] there's no hope inside
[1:49:53] all but gone. Then I met the one who
[1:49:57] came looking for me.
[1:50:01] He came looking for me.
[1:50:06] He came looking for me.
[1:50:11] Yes, he made a way when there was no way
[1:50:17] that I could see.
[1:50:21] Well, I drifted so far, but Jesus was
[1:50:25] near to rescue my soul and calm all my
[1:50:30] fears. Now I'm safe from all harm cuz I
[1:50:35] met the one who came looking for me.
[1:50:41] Well, Satan had already picked out my
[1:50:45] grave. His plan was to for me, put me
[1:50:50] away.
[1:50:52] It did get so far. Would anyone care?
[1:50:56] I'd soon be lost.
[1:51:01] Well, I knew my destruction was a matter
[1:51:04] of time, but Jesus appeared and he said,
[1:51:09] "This one's mine. Now I'm safe from all
[1:51:12] harm cuz he walked the storm. Came
[1:51:16] looking for me.
[1:51:20] He came looking for me.
[1:51:23] [Music]
[1:51:24] He came looking for me.
[1:51:30] Well, he made a way when there was no
[1:51:33] way that I could see
[1:51:39] when I drifted so far. Jesus was me to
[1:51:44] rescue my soul and calm my fears. Now
[1:51:49] I'm safe from all harm cuz I met the one
[1:51:53] that came looking for me. Can we sing
[1:51:57] that last verse again? Satan had already
[1:52:01] picked out my grave. His plan was to
[1:52:05] fool me, put me away. I drifted so far.
[1:52:10] Would anyone care that I'd soon be lost?
[1:52:17] Well, I knew my destruction was a matter
[1:52:21] of time. Jesus appeared who said this
[1:52:26] one's mine. I'm safe from all harm and I
[1:52:30] met the one they came looking for me.
[1:52:36] Well, I'm safe from all harm cuz I met
[1:52:40] the one that came looking for me.
[1:52:43] [Music]
[1:52:47] Amen. How many give the Lord a hand clap
[1:52:49] of praise this morning?

[1:57:48] But um so we look forward to that.
[1:57:51] Um, also if you're able to help in the
[1:57:54] the fundraiser that's going on in Ash
[1:57:56] Flat, it's it's eight days long or so. I
[1:57:59] think we have about till Friday of this
[1:58:01] week. So, we got five more days after
[1:58:03] today. Uh, please get with my wife and
[1:58:05] let her know that you're available and
[1:58:07] she'll get you on a schedule to come and
[1:58:08] help. Um, so we had a really good time
[1:58:11] with the young people this year. where
[1:58:12] we took I guess it was a little over 60
[1:58:14] people went to Silver Dollar City and
[1:58:17] Branson for a few days and stayed in in
[1:58:20] some nice condos and had a lot of fun
[1:58:21] with the kids. So that's how we pay for
[1:58:23] that trip. So if you uh if you like
[1:58:26] those kind of trips, well then anything
[1:58:28] you can do to help is more than
[1:58:30] appreciated. Amen. So we don't want
[1:58:32] Sarah to lose her zeal because if she
[1:58:34] don't do it, we can't do it no more. So
[1:58:36] because she's up there about every day
[1:58:38] and I don't have the time to be up there
[1:58:40] every day. So, I appreciate her doing
[1:58:42] that and Lori and Morgan done that. Want
[1:58:44] to ridge managed that. I know many of
[1:58:47] you helped. Thank you for helping, but
[1:58:49] they they managed that and we just
[1:58:51] decided it'd be best just to do in Ash
[1:58:54] Flat and that that way we could all be
[1:58:56] together and and um and so that just
[1:58:59] kind of made it easier on everybody. So,
[1:59:01] I know it's a little bit of a drive, but
[1:59:03] you know, if you are available, then
[1:59:05] then she'll let you know when you can
[1:59:07] come. And we sure appreciate everybody.
[1:59:10] You love the Lord this morning. Amen.
[1:59:12] Amen. So, Brother Brian, would you come
[1:59:14] close us in a word of prayer?
[1:59:20] [Music]
[1:59:27] Most gracious heavenly father, Lord,
[1:59:32] Lord, we thank you, Lord, for the word
[1:59:33] that you brought to us this morning,
[1:59:35] Lord.
[1:59:36] Father, lest we forget, Lord, of who we
[1:59:38] are, Lord. Father, and I'm thankful,
[1:59:41] Lord Jesus Christ, for a word, Father,
[1:59:44] not only a word that you brought, but
[1:59:46] you give us ears to hear and eyes to see
[1:59:48] and a heart to receive it, Lord. Father,
[1:59:51] let it settle in our hearts, Lord Jesus,
[1:59:53] that we daily measure ourselves by your
[1:59:56] word that we could come to our fullness,
[1:59:58] Lord Jesus. Lord, I thank you for each
[2:00:01] one that's here today, Lord. Thank you,
[2:00:03] Lord, for Sister Sarah and all that she
[2:00:05] does for the church. Lord, so many times
[2:00:07] I believe that the ministers wives get
[2:00:10] kind of left out, Lord. But Lord, they
[2:00:13] stand in the gap for their husbands,
[2:00:14] Lord. Not only Sister Sarah here, but
[2:00:17] all the ministers, Lord, and their
[2:00:19] wives, Lord, I pray that you would bless
[2:00:21] them, Lord Jesus, for all that they do,
[2:00:24] Lord, for the kingdom of heaven. Lord,
[2:00:26] bring us back to the next appointed
[2:00:28] time, Lord Jesus. be with brother Joe
[2:00:30] and brother Andrew and all the
[2:00:32] ministers, Lord, that's standing on the
[2:00:34] field today, Lord. Father, that you
[2:00:36] would anoint them with a double portion,
[2:00:37] Lord. Father, be with a fundraiser,
[2:00:40] Lord, that it would meet its purpose,
[2:00:41] Lord Jesus, for your purpose, Lord.
[2:00:44] Father, we ask you all these things in
[2:00:46] the name of the Lord Jesus Christ. Amen.
[2:00:49] [Music]
[2:00:58] Holding my shield of faith, I feel no
[2:01:01] alarm. When the enemy stands
[2:01:05] in like a flood, I will raise up a
[2:01:09] standard
[2:01:10] overcome. God bless you this morning.
[2:01:14] Faith and drown out the doubt. Holding
[2:01:17] my shield of faith. I feel no alarm.
[2:01:22] When the enemy comes in like a flood, I
[2:01:26] will raise up my standard and I'll
[2:01:30] overcome.
[2:01:32] Satan can't hear me. This line is for
[2:01:35] you. You have no power over what we go
[2:01:40] through. Victory may be in Jesus, but he
[2:01:44] lives in me, too. So I'll turn up my
[2:01:47] faith and show you what faith can do. I
[2:01:50] will turn up my praise and drown out the
[2:01:54] doubt. Holding my shield of faith and I
[2:01:58] feel no alarm. When the enemy comes
[2:02:02] in like a flood, I'll raise up my
[2:02:06] standard and I'll overcome.
[2:02:12] Hey. Hey. Hey.
