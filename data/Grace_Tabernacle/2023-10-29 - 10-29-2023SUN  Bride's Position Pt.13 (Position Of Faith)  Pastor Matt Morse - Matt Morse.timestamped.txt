[38:49] sanctification but we want to go up a
[38:51] little higher amen all the way into the

[40:05] chapter and we're going to read in the
[40:07] first verse the Bible says and Joshua
[40:10] the son of nun sent out of shadam two
[40:12] men to spy secretly saying go view the
[40:15] land even Jericho and they went and they
[40:18] came into a harlot's house named Rahab
[40:20] and lodged there and it was told the
[40:22] king of Jericho saying behold there came
[40:24] men in here tonight of the children of
[40:27] Israel to search out of the country and
[40:29] the king of Jericho said unto Rahab
[40:32] bring forth the men that are come to
[40:34] thee which are entered into thy house
[40:36] for they come to search out our country
[40:38] and the woman took the two men and she
[40:40] hid them and she said this there came in
[40:42] unto me but I don't know where they went
[40:44] and it came to pass about the time of
[40:46] the shutting of the gate when it was
[40:48] dark that the men went out and and where
[40:50] they went I do not know so pursue after
[40:52] them quickly and you shall overtake them
[40:54] but she brought she had brought them up
[40:56] to the roof of the house and she hid
[40:58] them with the stalks of flax and when
[41:00] she had laid in order upon the roof and
[41:02] the men pursued after them all the way
[41:04] to Jordan unto the Fords and as soon as
[41:07] they which pursued after them had gone
[41:09] out they shut the gate and before they
[41:11] were laid down she came up unto them
[41:14] upon the roof and she said unto the men
[41:17] I know that the Lord hath given you the
[41:19] land and that your terror is Fallen upon
[41:21] us and that all the inhabitants of the
[41:23] land faint because of you for We Have
[41:25] Heard the Lord dried up the water of the
[41:28] Red Sea for you when he came when you
[41:30] come out of Egypt and what you did unto
[41:32] the two kings of the amorites that were
[41:34] on the other side of Jordan sihon and OG
[41:37] whom you utterly destroyed and as soon
[41:39] as we had heard these things our hearts
[41:41] didn't melt neither did there remain any
[41:44] more courage in any man because of you
[41:46] for the Lord your God he is God in
[41:50] heaven above and in Earth beneath and
[41:52] we'll just ask the Lord to add his
[41:53] Blessing to the reading of the word you
[41:55] can be seated I know um man just God is
[41:58] just something isn't he I just just love
[42:01] the uh to read the word and my you can
[42:03] just read through one chapter or portion
[42:05] of scripture and you get so much
[42:06] inspiration and uh can go in so many
[42:09] different directions but I just think
[42:10] God is wonderful and I get to think
[42:12] about all the things that God does and
[42:14] how wonderful it is and seeing these
[42:16] young people come to church on fire for
[42:18] God and I I sitting in my back office
[42:20] and or in the in the office there and
[42:22] and brother Mark was singing and and I
[42:24] all I could hear was brother Amos I
[42:26] could hear brother Mark and brother Amos
[42:27] and my just hear that young man out here
[42:30] on fire for the Lord maybe others were
[42:31] making noise I don't know there's a
[42:33] pretty thick wall with insulation but I
[42:35] can hear him over the insulation and I
[42:37] thought you know what some people may
[42:39] look at that and they want to put it out
[42:40] you know he just putting on a show or
[42:42] making some noise or something like that
[42:43] but friends I got news for you it's just
[42:45] a fire that's burning in his heart and
[42:47] I'm glad he's he he he has a place that
[42:50] he can express what God matter of fact
[42:52] it ought to be on every one of our heart
[42:53] brother Wes said there ought to be a
[42:54] fire that's burning in us I I was
[42:56] preaching that Wednesday night I I got
[42:58] so excited about that after I left
[42:59] church and I got home and I went and
[43:01] repr preached it I sat down in my office
[43:02] and I spent a few more hours and reading
[43:04] on that thinking Lord is it was it me is
[43:07] there something really in there and my
[43:08] it just it just it just burned a fire in
[43:10] my heart thinking about what happens
[43:12] when a person rededicates their life to
[43:14] God and how that he can he can light a
[43:16] fire in you and I I spent about three or
[43:18] four hours on Wednesday night going back
[43:20] through that and and just studying on it
[43:22] and and seeing what God does and how
[43:24] many was here Wednesday night I know
[43:25] there was a handful that uh that was
[43:27] sick and wasn't able to be here but my
[43:28] isn't it isn't it something that by the
[43:30] rededication of a temple came the
[43:32] supernatural I I I I fed on that all all
[43:35] week of thinking how that uh what it was
[43:38] that God would bring a supernatural
[43:40] flame I me you remember that here here
[43:42] here they were under duress and here
[43:44] they had lost the ability to worship
[43:46] they had lost their Temple they had no
[43:48] rights to it and a group of Freedom
[43:50] Fighters got up that's what we need this
[43:51] morning we need a group of Freedom
[43:53] Fighters that'll rise up in the house of
[43:55] God and reestablish the worship in the
[43:57] temple I I think it takes some men and
[43:59] some women that are on fire for God that
[44:01] said I'm not willing to give it to the
[44:02] devil I I'm not willing to turn over to
[44:04] just some old denominational formalism
[44:06] or something like that in the house of
[44:08] God but there's it was some Freedom
[44:09] Fighters and you know what Freedom
[44:11] Fighters had to fight they had to they
[44:13] had to pile through things they have to
[44:14] walk through people's feelings and they
[44:16] had to walk through people's opinions
[44:17] and they have to walk through criticism
[44:19] brother Mah but it didn't matter they
[44:20] were fighting for the temple of God and
[44:22] they wanted the worship to be restored
[44:24] and they wanted the people to have their
[44:25] right ful place with God and now they
[44:27] went in there brother Mark and and they
[44:29] took the temple back over and when they
[44:31] went in there they found a little bit of
[44:32] oil that was left and a old sealed oil
[44:35] bottle and they put it in a and they put
[44:37] it in that little Candlestick or that
[44:38] great Candlestick the manora and they
[44:40] lit it and it should have only burned
[44:42] for a day and instead miraculously it
[44:45] burned for eight days and eight nights I
[44:47] thought isn't it something the
[44:48] rededication of the temple brought the
[44:50] supernatural it brought a miracle in
[44:52] Israel and it'll do it for you this
[44:53] morning you a man that'll dedicate his
[44:55] life to the Lord it'll bring the
[44:57] supernatural it'll bring a miracle in
[44:59] your life it'll light a fire in you that
[45:00] no man can put out I thought isn't it
[45:03] something I got to think it on that when
[45:04] I got home it was just something that it
[45:06] burned for eight days anybody catch that
[45:08] it burned for how many knows what the
[45:09] Eighth Day means it burned for eight
[45:11] days brother R said the eighth day was
[45:13] the Holy convocation you know we we we
[45:16] live in a period of time and and brother
[45:18] Mark whenever God created the world he
[45:20] created for Six Days on the seventh day
[45:22] he rested but still yet it was a period
[45:24] of time he said see we go through this
[45:26] age we go through all of time even into
[45:29] the Millennium but the Millennium is
[45:31] based on time it's a thousand years he
[45:33] said but after that then the Bride of
[45:35] Jesus Christ will enter into the holy
[45:38] convocation with God he said in other
[45:40] words the eighth day is going back into
[45:42] eternity see there's only seven days in
[45:44] a week so when you get to the Eighth Day
[45:46] the eighth day is the first day all over
[45:48] again so see what it is it's a symbol of
[45:50] Eternity I thought my isn't it something
[45:52] that the fire of God brother Mark that
[45:54] it didn't just burn in time it didn't
[45:56] just burn to get you through a few days
[45:58] it didn't just burn to to get you to the
[46:00] next stage but this fire of God it'll
[46:02] take you right out of time and right
[46:04] into eternity my that's what fire we
[46:07] need this morning I thought isn't that
[46:08] something that that that's the very
[46:10] thing that Moses saw burning on the
[46:11] altar whenever God lit the fire and he
[46:13] came down and God said this fire that is
[46:16] burning upon the altar it shall never go
[46:18] out brother B there said there's
[46:20] something within us it's a fire that's
[46:21] burning it's a light that's been lit by
[46:24] God how many say Amen to that if you
[46:26] feel tired just stand up this morning
[46:27] we're going to preach right through it
[46:29] he said there's a fire in us that's
[46:31] burning and it's lit it's been lit by
[46:33] God and there ain't no Breeze can blow
[46:35] it out there ain't no code spell in the
[46:37] church can blow it out there ain't no
[46:39] indifference among people that can blow
[46:40] it out there ain't no persecution in the
[46:42] world that can blow out a flame that God
[46:45] has lit it's a fire of God Brother David
[46:48] Paul it's the same fire that fell on the
[46:49] day of Pentecost it's a fire of God but
[46:52] mam said we can't live by any other fire
[46:54] that's the fire we have to have the
[46:56] whole world is living by a painted fire
[46:59] they're painting churches of
[47:00] Christianity of what formalism is and
[47:03] what it is a day gone by and my look how
[47:05] they worship back in the book of Acts
[47:07] and my look how they healed the sick
[47:08] back in the book of Acts look how they
[47:10] went to church back in the book of Acts
[47:12] he said we can't live by a painted fire
[47:14] you can't get warmed by it he said he
[47:16] said well they can say it's a great big
[47:18] fire but a painted fire will never make
[47:19] you warm what we need in the church
[47:21] today is the same fire that burned on
[47:23] the day of Pentecost we need the bap ISM
[47:26] of the Holy Ghost you can't get warn by
[47:28] some historical Doctrine but we have got
[47:31] to have the Holy Ghost right now The
[47:35] Same Spirit the same Pentecostal fire
[47:37] that burned in the first day is the same
[47:39] Pentecostal fire that we have today
[47:42] burning in our hearts and the Believers
[47:44] said amen it's the same fire of God
[47:47] that's burning in our hearts friends I
[47:49] pray that fire is burning in your heart
[47:51] this morning I pray that there's a torch
[47:53] I pray there's something burning in your
[47:54] heart that you can't wait to get to the
[47:56] house of God and if it ain't there
[47:58] friends I invite you to the altar this
[47:59] morning to rededicate your life to God
[48:02] cuz you need something that's lit in
[48:03] your heart that'll cause you to put God

[48:08] holy ghost filed Christian be a real man

[48:16] of cowards they were men and women of
[48:19] God and that's what God calls us to be
[48:21] today so we can't we can't live by a

[49:13] needs amen God knows what we have need
[49:17] of I'm going to start my service this
[49:19] morning several Services brother Wesley
[49:22] we've been speaking on the bride's
[49:24] position teaching on the history of the
[49:27] Gentile bride in the top and went
[49:29] through the background of of her purpose
[49:31] and her placing subjection and the
[49:34] stories of Ruth and Joseph and we've
[49:36] spent many services on this subject and
[49:39] I don't know about you but it just gives
[49:41] me a confidence of seeing myself in the
[49:43] scripture is anybody is anybody else
[49:45] that way but me anybody anybody feel
[49:47] that way am I the only one that feels
[49:48] that way it does it gives me confidence
[49:50] to see myself in the scripture amen I
[49:53] it's just wonderful my eyes are a little
[49:55] fake
[49:56] this morning so if you agree with me say
[49:58] amen I can't see the heads nodding real
[50:00] well it's better for you just say Amen
[50:01] it it sure helps an old preacher out I
[50:03] ain't much of a Preacher anyway but when
[50:04] people pull God can speak amen I I
[50:07] didn't come here to be the to be the
[50:08] pastor or be some great guy or or to be
[50:10] able to bring my own ideology I don't
[50:12] have nothing to give you only God can
[50:14] give it to you and if you want it from
[50:15] God then pull it out of God Amen God
[50:17] will give you what you have need of this
[50:18] morning amen I believe that does anybody
[50:20] still believe that amen we're a bride
[50:23] Church we're not a denomination we're a
[50:25] bride church we we come to church for a
[50:27] reason we come to church to get
[50:29] something from God Amen I want to hear
[50:31] from the Lord say see we could we we've
[50:33] been speaking on this and just seeing
[50:35] how the bride came and this morning the
[50:37] the different position or the bride's
[50:39] position this morning I'd like to take
[50:41] this subject that the bride's position
[50:43] is a position of Faith how many knows
[50:45] that that the people of God are a people
[50:47] of faith I said how many knows that the
[50:50] people of God thank you are a people of
[50:52] Faith it's actually it's actually a
[50:54] Commandment that Jesus just made did you
[50:56] know that it wasn't it was a commandment
[50:57] it wasn't just a a request but remember
[51:00] whenever the disciples they left out of
[51:02] Jerusalem and they came by an old fig
[51:04] tree one day brother Mark that had been
[51:05] withered and there wasn't nothing left
[51:06] on it it was withered down to the roots
[51:08] and Peter looked at the Fig Tree and he
[51:10] said Lord he said he he began to recall
[51:12] what had happened a few days before he
[51:14] said you know a few days ago we walked
[51:15] by this tree and it had leaves on it but
[51:17] it wasn't bearing fruit and you looked
[51:19] at the tree that wasn't bearing fruit
[51:20] and you said cursed be this tree that it
[51:22] never bear fruit again he said isn't it
[51:24] a a something that we come by and now
[51:27] just a few days later what used to be
[51:29] green and the leaves were growing and
[51:30] here it is and it don't even have no
[51:32] life on it at all it's wither down to
[51:33] the roots how many remembers what
[51:35] Jesus's response was he answered them
[51:37] and he said have faith in God this is a
[51:41] commandment of Jesus Christ have faith
[51:44] in God he said and whosoever shall say
[51:47] to this mountain be thou removed and
[51:49] cast into the sea and not doubt in his
[51:50] heart but Shall Believe those things
[51:52] which he say shall come to pass he shall
[51:54] have whatever he says so here Jesus
[51:57] brother Wesley he gives us a principle
[51:59] to live by we're going to we're going to
[52:00] speak on this this morning that the
[52:02] position of a Believer or the position
[52:04] of the Bride is a position of Faith he
[52:07] gives us this principle he says
[52:08] therefore he said whatever things you
[52:10] desire When you pray believe and you
[52:13] shall receive how many say that with me
[52:15] pray believe and receive this is a this
[52:18] is a very principle that Jesus laid out
[52:20] for the for the for the believer you
[52:21] pray you believe and receive and I
[52:23] thought my isn't it something that today
[52:25] there's a lot of people that pray and
[52:27] believe and don't receive even though he
[52:29] gave this as a principle pray and
[52:31] believe and receive and oh Kyle and Beck
[52:33] it's sure good to see you my they had a
[52:35] wonderful trip and got married had a
[52:37] beautiful wedding and man it's just let
[52:39] me see them Rings they got still praise
[52:41] the lord they're still wearing them
[52:42] that's a good sign man I want y'all give
[52:44] them a hand this
[52:46] morning what a what a beautiful wedding
[52:48] that they had amen sure good to see you
[52:51] back buddy and glad they made it back I
[52:53] was hoping they didn't move off to
[52:54] another another state they got married
[52:55] and went to Alabama and never came home
[52:58] but praise the lord they're back my
[53:00] goodness so so here's the principle he
[53:02] gives us pray believe receive but you
[53:04] notice many pray brother Mark they
[53:06] believe but they don't receive but the
[53:07] reason is is because Jesus actually
[53:09] interjected something in the next verse
[53:11] that most people don't read he says but
[53:13] when you stand praying forgive if you
[53:15] have an odd against any for the Father
[53:17] in Heaven can't forgive you if you don't
[53:18] forgive others see see here he lays this
[53:21] in here brother Mark there's a I think
[53:23] there's a lot of good Christians that
[53:24] have a lot of faith that miss out on a
[53:26] lot of blessings because they can't
[53:27] forgive one another is't that something
[53:29] they go that here God has called us to
[53:31] this place of Faith but but it don't
[53:33] seem like it's happening don't don't
[53:34] seem like nothing's moving in your life
[53:36] but it's because of things that have
[53:38] been built up and bitterness and and and
[53:40] feelings against other brothers and
[53:42] sisters and and and I know how it is
[53:44] whenever something happens to you I know
[53:45] what I'm just going to preach I'm a
[53:46] pastor so you know sometimes you say
[53:48] well you don't know what they said about
[53:50] me and you don't you don't know what
[53:51] they did to me and you don't M matter of
[53:53] fact it ain't even that way today it's
[53:55] you don't know what they said about my
[53:56] friend they don't have to do it to you
[53:57] for you to be mad at them they got to do
[53:59] it to somebody you know and you don't
[54:00] know what they did to my sister and my
[54:02] they and after all they they they stole
[54:04] my boyfriend and they they stole my
[54:05] girlfriend and they they they kind of
[54:07] they they talked about me on social they
[54:09] got all these reasons why it's okay to
[54:11] Harbor bitterness and not not forgive
[54:13] one another but you know when I read the
[54:14] Bible brother Mark I can't find that
[54:16] anywhere where Jesus said when you stand
[54:18] forgive unless they stole your boyfriend
[54:21] forgive unless they talk to you talk bad
[54:23] about you online forgive unless they
[54:25] walked by you and didn't shake your hand
[54:27] forgive unless they unless they they
[54:29] don't talk to you no more forgive unless
[54:31] they stole your your lunch money forgive
[54:33] unless they gave you a swirly or
[54:34] something forgive it had nothing to do
[54:36] with it brother there was no there was
[54:38] nothing in there that was an excuse to
[54:40] not forgive he said when you stand
[54:42] praying forgive if you have anything
[54:44] against anybody forgive them for how can
[54:46] your father in Heaven forgive you if you
[54:49] can't forgive
[54:50] those forgive your brothers of their
[54:52] trespass it don't matter what they did
[54:53] it don't matter what they said now you
[54:55] walk into a church you wonder why it's
[54:56] so cold in a church and so stiff and
[54:59] starchy in a church it's because people
[55:00] can't walk in a church by somebody that
[55:02] they don't have something against them
[55:04] and they'll turn around and walk away
[55:05] from each other and brush shoulders when
[55:07] they walk by my friend if you ever got
[55:09] that feeling you are to stop yourself in
[55:11] your filthy tracks and turn around and
[55:12] say God forgive me that I might forgive
[55:15] my brother and you ought to put your arm
[55:17] around her or your sister and say
[55:18] brother forgive me that I've held
[55:20] something against you my may may God do
[55:22] something special for you this morning
[55:24] you forgive one another you love one
[55:26] another you go the extra mile to do
[55:28] something special for one another if
[55:29] it's somebody you don't like then do
[55:31] something extra for them so you can get
[55:33] that Spirit off of you and allow God to
[55:35] come and move in the house of God again
[55:37] don't let bitterness and starchiness and
[55:39] all these things come in in the church
[55:41] it drags the people of God down there
[55:43] ain't no fire burning in me because
[55:44] you've allowed things to come into your
[55:46] life he said forgive that you may be
[55:48] forgiven I was talking to a brother
[55:49] Friday and you know about about things
[55:52] that people was doing and all this I
[55:53] said you know I said brother I'm just
[55:55] not good with grudges it's I'm just not
[55:57] good with it I that's that's part of my
[55:59] nature you know I can get real mad at
[56:01] you but it don't take very long I can't
[56:02] hold it I I just don't like grudges I
[56:04] don't like the way it makes me feel I I
[56:06] don't like holding things against people
[56:07] I I want people to be free and I want to
[56:09] be free and so you know I I go out I let
[56:12] them go for inst don't you realize that
[56:13] a grudge is a cancer it's a cancer it's
[56:16] something that grows and it may start as
[56:18] a small thing but I'm I'm I'm here this
[56:20] morning they ain't got nothing to do my
[56:21] message but but but but it may start out
[56:23] as a small thing but it grows through
[56:25] your life and it takes over every part
[56:26] of your life and it ain't just in your
[56:28] spiritual life it affects your natural
[56:30] life because you get it so spiritually
[56:31] so mi mixed up and all these things
[56:33] going and then you can't even work right
[56:35] and you can't you can't even do your job
[56:37] right and you can't even you can't even
[56:38] have a good relationship at home because
[56:40] you got all this built up on the inside
[56:43] so let it go just be free this morning
[56:46] Let It Go forgive your brothers and your
[56:48] sisters and that isn't that what Jesus
[56:50] said that was our example don't you
[56:52] realize there ain't a soul on Earth that
[56:53] ever went through what he went went
[56:55] through he was hung on a cross stripped
[56:57] of his clothes humiliated in front of
[56:59] the public they were sitting there
[57:00] making fun of him and mocking him and
[57:02] spitting on and you're worried about
[57:03] somebody talking about you on the
[57:05] internet he looked out at them and he
[57:07] said father forgive them for they know
[57:09] not what they do that's our pattern this
[57:11] morning that's what we go after ain't
[57:13] none of us been done that wrong you know
[57:16] sometimes your brothers and sisters
[57:17] sometimes they speak out of character
[57:19] sometimes they act out of character but
[57:21] we don't kick them to the curb you put
[57:22] your arm around them and you love them
[57:24] anyway you forgive one another that was
[57:27] free our position is a position of Faith
[57:31] this is what God called us to brother
[57:32] Brown said preaching usually catches The
[57:33] Sinner it brings him under condemnation
[57:36] by the word but teaching places that man
[57:38] positionally what he is we can never
[57:40] rightly be able to have faith until
[57:42] positionally we know what we are he says
[57:44] so how can you be in a position to
[57:46] rightly have faith if we don't take time
[57:49] to teach the word how can you be in a
[57:51] position to rightly have faith if it
[57:53] isn't taught brother Mark here what the
[57:54] prophet is telling us if it isn't taught
[57:56] then there would be a lack of faith and
[57:58] how many knows what happens when when
[58:00] there's a lack of faith Paul says
[58:02] without faith it is impossible to please
[58:05] God so if you don't get in your position
[58:08] then you can't rightly have faith and if
[58:10] you can't rightly have faith then it's
[58:12] impossible to please God you see how
[58:14] important it is to know what your
[58:15] position is our position as the Bride of
[58:18] Jesus Christ it matters it's of the
[58:20] greatest importance brother Wesley
[58:21] because without it we can't even please
[58:23] God without it pleasing God's an
[58:25] impossibility it's not even an option in
[58:27] your life that you would ever please God
[58:29] if you don't get into your position or
[58:31] know your position as the Bride of Jesus
[58:33] Christ matter of fact Paul he would say
[58:35] it like this he said see whatever is not
[58:37] faith is sin faith is one thing and
[58:40] everything outside of faith is sin he's
[58:42] called us to a position of Faith you
[58:44] realize that this world today brother
[58:46] Mark they don't live by faith that's why
[58:48] we don't pattern after the world they
[58:50] don't live like we live when it comes to
[58:53] Faith we we don't just value every
[58:54] opinion there's many opinions in the
[58:56] world today but but we don't value every
[58:58] opinion I thought you know if I wanted
[59:00] to build a rocket this morning yall are
[59:02] wonderful people and there's some very
[59:03] intelligent men and women in the church
[59:05] but but I don't think any of us know how
[59:07] to build a rocket right yet so but if I
[59:09] wanted to build a rocket I'd find a good
[59:10] rocket scientist and I would and I would
[59:12] I would I would ask him I I would ask
[59:14] him how you know you know I'm planning
[59:16] on building a rocket and maybe a good
[59:17] rocket scientist he he he'd asked you
[59:19] the right questions cuz he knew how to
[59:20] build a rocket and he'd say he'd say
[59:22] well what's the mission parameter cuz
[59:23] there ain't no silly start building a
[59:25] rocket if you don't know what it's what
[59:26] it's going to be used for and and then
[59:28] he would tell you what a propulsion
[59:29] system you'd have to have a certain type
[59:31] of propulsion system you'd have to have
[59:32] a fuel you'd have to be able to Harbor
[59:34] the the momentum and and be able to keep
[59:36] it into a place that you can use it at
[59:38] one time and and so you know you'd have
[59:40] to have thrusters and they' have to be
[59:42] positionally placed on the rocket so a
[59:43] good rocket scientist he'd have the
[59:45] answers on how to build a rocket but you
[59:48] know if that rocket scientist isn't
[59:50] isn't a Believer he could be the
[59:51] smartest guy in the world but but but
[59:54] but I wouldn't ask ask his opinion on
[59:55] faith because his opinion would hold no
[59:57] value so that means I wouldn't ask the
[59:59] rocket scientist about spiritual matters
[1:00:01] and I I wouldn't ask him about my
[1:00:03] everyday walk with God and and a
[1:00:04] Christian Life and and how I can get
[1:00:06] closer to God and how I can move farther
[1:00:08] in my faith he may be a real brilliant
[1:00:10] man he may have a lot of wise answers
[1:00:12] but when it comes to Faith he don't he
[1:00:14] he adds no value to to understanding
[1:00:16] what faith is and I thought it's the
[1:00:18] same way with with churches in in the
[1:00:20] world today you really you realize that
[1:00:22] you just can't pattern your church and
[1:00:24] the and the way you go to church and the
[1:00:26] way you serve God you can't pattern them
[1:00:28] after other churches and other
[1:00:29] denominations and their and their own
[1:00:31] ideology especially when it contradicts
[1:00:33] with the Bible so so in other words you
[1:00:35] can't take a church that don't believe
[1:00:37] in Divine Healing and ask them how to
[1:00:39] conduct a prayer line see you can you
[1:00:41] can get online they give you all kinds
[1:00:42] of advice there's there's all kinds of
[1:00:44] blogs out there well if I went to church
[1:00:46] this is the way it ought to be and I
[1:00:47] think this is how we ought to conduct it
[1:00:49] and I think this is how the pastor ought
[1:00:50] to do it and and for me and my family
[1:00:52] this is how we'll do it but friends
[1:00:53] don't you realize that these people that
[1:00:55] put these things out there they don't
[1:00:56] believe like you believe so they give
[1:00:58] all these parameters of how we go to
[1:01:00] church and when we go to church and and
[1:01:02] how to conduct ourselves and how the
[1:01:03] pastor ought to be but friends we you
[1:01:05] you you don't ask him them them things
[1:01:07] because we don't pattern after the world
[1:01:09] we don't pattern after things that that
[1:01:11] they don't believe like we believe
[1:01:12] that's why they had that kind of stand
[1:01:13] they don't believe like we believe
[1:01:15] that's why they Blog the things they
[1:01:16] blog we they don't believe like we
[1:01:17] believe that's why they post the things
[1:01:19] they post because they're not Believers
[1:01:21] like you are they're not a part of the
[1:01:22] Bride of Jesus Christ but ask for the
[1:01:24] bride she has to have she has to pattern
[1:01:26] after something else you realize that
[1:01:28] that this world today they they they
[1:01:30] live by such fear they they work out of
[1:01:32] fear somebody say Amen it's the gospel
[1:01:34] truth they live out of fear they work
[1:01:35] out of fear they operate out of fear
[1:01:37] they teach out of fear I hope I can
[1:01:39] survive I hope we can make it through
[1:01:40] another day why we don't have enough
[1:01:42] food to to to to to get through tomorrow
[1:01:44] and my I don't know if God will ever
[1:01:46] heal me isn't it something the fear that
[1:01:48] is on people today my I don't even know
[1:01:50] if I'll have enough meal as many times
[1:01:51] as God's fed you and your family how how
[1:01:54] can world could we go through a day and
[1:01:55] be afraid that God can't take care of us
[1:01:57] tomorrow I don't know if I can be healed
[1:01:59] as many times have you've seen people
[1:02:01] healed I don't know if God can heal me
[1:02:03] through this I I don't know if God's
[1:02:04] going to come through for me I don't
[1:02:06] know if he's going to help me through
[1:02:07] this trial I don't know if he'll help me
[1:02:08] through this battle he might just leave
[1:02:10] me in this Valley I don't know if I'll
[1:02:11] ever see another Mountaintop
[1:02:14] again don't you realize we have a father
[1:02:17] that owns a cattle on a thousand hills
[1:02:21] he takes care of his children he feeds
[1:02:23] them he strengthens them he you said
[1:02:25] brother Matt you don't know I may not
[1:02:26] know a lot of things I never claimed to
[1:02:28] be a smart guy but I know the Bible I
[1:02:30] know this I know there was a woman in
[1:02:31] the Bible one time in the middle of a
[1:02:33] famine when everybody else around her
[1:02:35] was starving that she had food in her
[1:02:36] meal Barrel brother the mark it looked
[1:02:38] like the whole world was starving and
[1:02:40] the government gave out the answer and
[1:02:41] here here's how you ration your food and
[1:02:43] there were people that died from
[1:02:45] starvation but here's a woman that her
[1:02:47] meal Barrel never ran dry she ate the
[1:02:49] entire famine she never missed a meal
[1:02:52] and her family never missed a meal let
[1:02:53] me tell you why cuz she wasn't patterned
[1:02:55] after the world she followed the pattern
[1:02:58] of a prophet of God and when he came
[1:02:59] into the house where she lived he said
[1:03:01] you put God first and God will supply
[1:03:03] all your needs you put God first and
[1:03:06] he'll take care of your sickness he'll
[1:03:07] take care of your finances he'll take
[1:03:09] care of your family trouble he'll take
[1:03:11] care of the problems in your home and
[1:03:13] the problems at your job she follow the
[1:03:15] pattern of a prophet of God we live by a
[1:03:17] different pattern than the world lives
[1:03:19] by this is our god brother Mark he takes
[1:03:22] care of his children he's the same God
[1:03:24] that fed Elijah by a bunch of ravens
[1:03:26] when Elijah didn't have the ability to
[1:03:27] work he didn't have the ability he
[1:03:29] didn't have the ability to even feed
[1:03:30] himself he laid down and was willing to
[1:03:32] give up and die but God wasn't done with
[1:03:34] him and God wouldn't let him die and he
[1:03:36] fed him out in the wilderness he's the
[1:03:39] same God that went down on the river
[1:03:40] bank and fed 5,000 with two fish and
[1:03:43] five loaves of bread and he went down
[1:03:45] another time he fed another 4,000 when
[1:03:47] they were hungry let me tell you God
[1:03:49] feeds his children he went to the
[1:03:51] Wilderness and and the children of
[1:03:53] Israel two million of went across the
[1:03:54] desert and for 40 years he he rained
[1:03:57] Mana out of heaven and every morning
[1:04:00] they had a meal to eat that's our god
[1:04:02] he's a provider Bible say he's the same
[1:04:05] yesterday today and forever if he ever
[1:04:08] fed the hungry he can still feed the
[1:04:10] hungry if he ever healed the sick he can
[1:04:12] still heal the sick he said I am the
[1:04:14] Lord thy God and I change
[1:04:18] not and I encourage you not to
[1:04:21] change we serve a living God we're
[1:04:24] follow after the pattern that God set
[1:04:25] forth this is what David said he said
[1:04:28] the Lord knoweth the days of the
[1:04:29] righteous and their inheritance shall be
[1:04:31] forever they shall not be ashamed in the
[1:04:34] evil time and in the days of famine they
[1:04:37] shall be satisfied that's our pattern
[1:04:40] the Wicked Will perish the enemies of
[1:04:42] the Lord shall be as the fat of the
[1:04:44] Lambs be consumed into smoke they'll be
[1:04:45] consumed away the wicked borrow and
[1:04:48] payeth not again but the righteous
[1:04:49] showeth mercy and gives for such as be
[1:04:52] blessed of him shall inherit the earth
[1:04:54] and they that be cursed of him shall be
[1:04:56] cut off for the steps of a good man are
[1:04:58] ordered by the Lord and He Del lith his
[1:05:01] way and though he
[1:05:04] fall did you catch that though who fall
[1:05:08] the good
[1:05:09] man sometimes good men fall sometimes
[1:05:12] good women fall though he fall he shall
[1:05:14] not be utterly cast down that's my God
[1:05:18] though he fall he shall not be cast down
[1:05:21] for the Lord will uphold him with his
[1:05:23] hand
[1:05:25] David said I have been young glory to
[1:05:27] God he said I've been young and now I'm
[1:05:30] old he said but there's one thing I've
[1:05:32] never seen I've never seen the righteous
[1:05:34] forsaken and I've never seen God's
[1:05:36] children begging bread he is ever
[1:05:39] merciful and he lendeth and his seed is
[1:05:41] blessed so depart from Evil and do good
[1:05:44] and dwell forever more I've been young
[1:05:47] and I'm old now but I've never seen the
[1:05:50] righteous forsaken my Lord that makes me
[1:05:52] feel like having church this morning I
[1:05:54] may just have church by myself brother
[1:05:55] somebody put a wall across here and let
[1:05:56] me let me have church like I really feel
[1:05:58] I've never seen the righteous forsaken
[1:06:00] and I've never seen God's children
[1:06:03] begging bread God's still a provider
[1:06:06] friends let me tell you I know what it's
[1:06:07] like don't think brother Matt you don't
[1:06:10] know what you're going through and don't
[1:06:11] don't know what it's like and you know
[1:06:13] to go through trials and hardships and
[1:06:15] friend you're it ain't been that long
[1:06:17] ago my my life ain't always been a
[1:06:19] better roses it ain't always been that
[1:06:21] way I can tell you can I just preach a
[1:06:23] minute I I just feel like preaching I I
[1:06:25] remember when I was growing up we we I
[1:06:27] grew up in a family that didn't have
[1:06:28] nothing the only cars we had was that
[1:06:30] that was any count was handed down by
[1:06:32] somebody else when they got done with it
[1:06:34] I remember what it was like not to have
[1:06:36] anything I remember going to a to a
[1:06:38] little gas station down there that that
[1:06:40] the guy was nice enough to my mom that
[1:06:41] he let us use Wick vouchers for real
[1:06:43] food how you like that when you go and
[1:06:45] get a pack of &ms with a wick voucher he

[1:06:50] it we didn't have nothing we didn't we
[1:06:53] we didn't have nothing and growing up I
[1:06:54] remember r with my mom one day we're

[1:07:35] mom my mom was a single mom the last few
[1:07:37] years of my my childhood or or the late
[1:07:40] childhood there and starting college and
[1:07:42] in first few years of college we live
[1:07:43] with my mom she was and and trying to
[1:07:46] take care of us by herself she started
[1:07:47] an inhome daycare trying to uh make a
[1:07:50] little bit of money that we could even
[1:07:51] that we could even survive to try to
[1:07:53] support her kids cuz they wanted to go
[1:07:54] to college and and try and do everything
[1:07:56] we can just to get through another day
[1:07:57] it was a tough time and when I got
[1:07:59] married me and my wife moved in my
[1:08:01] bedroom where my mom was we paid a
[1:08:03] little bit to help her on the rent and I
[1:08:05] remember my wife calling me one day when
[1:08:07] I was over at the school and and she
[1:08:08] called me she said hey there's a couple
[1:08:10] of guys here in they're coming to get
[1:08:12] our bedroom suit we didn't even have
[1:08:14] nothing I drove a S10 truck that had a
[1:08:16] previous damaged title you had to open
[1:08:17] up the hood on the truck to turn the
[1:08:19] heat on a little valve on the heater
[1:08:20] core and it got in the winter time You'
[1:08:22] turn the heater core valve and that's
[1:08:23] where the heat would come from there was
[1:08:25] no thermostat so whenever it got cold or
[1:08:27] it got too hot you cracked the window
[1:08:28] that's how you cooled it back off that's
[1:08:30] how it was whenever we got married she
[1:08:32] had a beat up old car we took a little
[1:08:33] clothes line or a clothes hanger and got
[1:08:36] in the gear shifter of the car and make
[1:08:38] the gear shifter work that we can get
[1:08:39] back and forth we bought a heater at
[1:08:40] Walmart that plugged up into into her
[1:08:42] little car in the in the little the
[1:08:44] lighter outlet that that blowed a little
[1:08:46] bit of heat so we could sit there when
[1:08:48] Jordan was a little girl Jordan was
[1:08:49] piled up in the backseat of that car at
[1:08:51] the Christmas parade on that little
[1:08:52] bitty heater to stay warm cuz I couldn't
[1:08:53] couldn't even afford to have a heater in
[1:08:54] my
[1:08:56] car I wasn't born with everything I
[1:08:58] wasn't born I I understand what it's
[1:09:00] like they come in they took our our bed

[1:09:12] payments on it and I couldn't afford the
[1:09:13] payment on it no more and they came in I
[1:09:15] came home that night the only thing we
[1:09:17] had left was a an airup mattress in our
[1:09:18] bedroom had no dresser and no bed and
[1:09:21] all that stuff was gone had a little
[1:09:22] airup mattress and I said babe don't

[1:09:34] go through things every one of us have
[1:09:36] challenges we face it don't matter how
[1:09:37] much you have you have challenges and
[1:09:39] you have trials there they're different
[1:09:40] trials different levels we all we all go
[1:09:42] through things but God is still a
[1:09:46] provider God is still more than able he

[1:09:50] you through if I can say something
[1:09:52] encouraging to you this morning God he
[1:09:55] hadn't forgotten you he don't forsake
[1:09:57] you he'll he'll bring you through Mark I
[1:10:00] got thinking about how I was in India
[1:10:02] one time and I got done with one of them
[1:10:04] meetings and them little people they
[1:10:05] they don't have nothing they're just
[1:10:07] poor my you don't even know what poor is
[1:10:10] friends I I mean that you don't know
[1:10:12] what poor is in the United States of
[1:10:14] America it's so it's the poverty
[1:10:17] stricken when you walk down the road
[1:10:19] thousands of people I I have a photo and
[1:10:22] it's sad to even to even have but I have
[1:10:24] a photo of looking down the street and
[1:10:26] as far as you could see it was caught
[1:10:28] side by side of people sleeping on the
[1:10:29] road not a box here and there under a
[1:10:31] bridge somewhere thousands and tens of
[1:10:34] thousands of people that don't even have
[1:10:35] a home to live in the ones that have
[1:10:37] homes are tarps with thatch roofs the
[1:10:40] middle class have a tarp around the a
[1:10:43] couple of sticks with a thatch roof and
[1:10:45] they're the kids that have homes with
[1:10:46] their dirt floors to live in they're
[1:10:47] poor they don't have nothing it's a poor
[1:10:49] people I remember going into one of them
[1:10:51] meetings the Lord's moving and take care
[1:10:54] of them and somehow they're always fed
[1:10:56] and even when they don't have much and I
[1:10:58] remember a little girl she was about
[1:10:59] eight or nine years old and she' come up
[1:11:01] with her hand held out and I kind of
[1:11:02] gave her a little hug and she held her
[1:11:04] hand out and I thought she maybe wrote
[1:11:06] something so I stuck my hand out and she
[1:11:08] dropped some coins in my hand I said
[1:11:10] well I can't take your coins you take
[1:11:12] them back I I don't want them here a
[1:11:13] little girl she didn't even have shoes
[1:11:14] on her feet and try to give me coins I
[1:11:17] thought my you no I can't take that you
[1:11:18] you take that back you you go give that
[1:11:20] to Mama you don't don't don't give that
[1:11:21] to me and the pastor he was sitting
[1:11:23] there walking with me he said brother
[1:11:25] please take that I said I can't take
[1:11:27] that from her she don't she don't have
[1:11:28] nothing my he said no brother I'm
[1:11:30] begging you please take that don't don't
[1:11:32] don't don't Rob her please take that he
[1:11:34] said that that little girl she's been
[1:11:36] taught he said please accept it he said
[1:11:38] I've taught these children to give he
[1:11:40] said I've taught them the these aren't
[1:11:41] these aren't just ordinary people he
[1:11:43] said they're children of God and and
[1:11:45] God's always provided for us and I've
[1:11:46] taught them to live by faith and always
[1:11:48] give to God and always always and don't
[1:11:50] and don't worry about tomorrow God God
[1:11:52] Holds Tomorrow he said I've taught him
[1:11:53] to give would you please take it and so
[1:11:56] here grudgingly brother Dave Paul I I
[1:11:58] took the money from her little bit of
[1:12:00] money and I added it up it was about 9
[1:12:02] cents in American dollars he said those
[1:12:04] kids have been saving that up all year
[1:12:05] that they could give you a little bit of
[1:12:06] offering and I found out that that
[1:12:08] wasn't even the offering from the little
[1:12:10] girl it was the offering from the Sunday
[1:12:12] school class it's what 30 or 40 kids in
[1:12:14] a Sunday school class had saved up
[1:12:17] because they wanted to help support a
[1:12:18] meeting we're talking about nine or 10
[1:12:21] cents I thought my it's people that have
[1:12:24] a heart even when they had nothing to
[1:12:26] give brother Mark even when they were
[1:12:28] poor he said but I've taught them to
[1:12:30] have faith in God I've taught them to
[1:12:32] give I've taught them the principles of
[1:12:34] the Gospel of Jesus Christ I thought my
[1:12:37] isn't it something I remember when I
[1:12:39] when I left I said brother okay I'll
[1:12:40] take it and I I done purposed in my
[1:12:43] heart everything I had left before I
[1:12:45] left I was going to give to that Sunday
[1:12:46] school and I I I stayed in a cheaper
[1:12:48] Hotel I ate less food I did everything I
[1:12:51] could that when I left I took several
[1:12:53] hundred over there to that church and I
[1:12:54] this is for the purpose of the Sunday
[1:12:56] School only it'll not be used for this
[1:12:58] church I'm ordering y'all God is my
[1:12:59] witness it is be used for those kids
[1:13:01] they bought them new Bibles they bought
[1:13:03] them new shoes everything I could
[1:13:04] because it just to see the the principle
[1:13:07] of faith that was instilled in a little
[1:13:09] poor people that didn't have nothing
[1:13:11] this is this is what God has taught the
[1:13:13] church to operate under brother Mark I
[1:13:15] think you see we're not children of fear
[1:13:17] you think about fear and why it's so
[1:13:19] powerful I may have got off my thought
[1:13:21] y'all forgive me but the elements that
[1:13:24] makes fear powerful is that fear don't
[1:13:26] have to actually be a threat you realize
[1:13:28] fear can be completely fabricated if I
[1:13:31] took a box and and I handed it to little
[1:13:33] Jonah here said hey don't open that box
[1:13:35] it's got a brown recluse in it about
[1:13:36] that big round how many thinks Jonah
[1:13:38] would open it up he ain't going to open
[1:13:40] the box it's got a brown recluse it's
[1:13:42] got a big rattlesnake in it don't open
[1:13:43] it but there don't have to be a
[1:13:45] rattlesnake in the Box Jonah would
[1:13:46] probably open
[1:13:48] it but most of us wouldn't open it he
[1:13:51] he's going to investigate it he he he
[1:13:53] put it in a jar but but we wouldn't open
[1:13:55] it but it don't have to be a real fear
[1:13:56] you could you could think something was
[1:13:58] in it and you could avoid it you you
[1:13:59] hear a scary noise in the room and you
[1:14:01] think somebody's in there and you don't
[1:14:02] go in you call everybody there there's
[1:14:04] somebody in the room but there don't
[1:14:05] have to be really anybody in there it
[1:14:06] could be a fabricated lie but fear is
[1:14:09] such a powerful emotion that it can be
[1:14:11] based entirely on speculation don't have
[1:14:13] to have any grounds to it at all matter
[1:14:14] of fact by the dictionary it says fear
[1:14:16] is an emotion caused by the belief that
[1:14:19] something is dangerous it don't it ain't
[1:14:20] caused by something being dangerous it's
[1:14:22] caused by the belie that something is
[1:14:24] dangerous so there don't have to
[1:14:25] actually be any danger it's just based
[1:14:27] on speculation and people they operate
[1:14:29] out of this they live out of it I'm not
[1:14:31] talking about the fear that God told us
[1:14:33] to have the the fear or having reverence
[1:14:35] to God but this fear or this Terror or
[1:14:37] fright or or horror or Panic alarm all
[1:14:41] these nervousness and and all these
[1:14:43] things that come along with it and and
[1:14:46] anxiety and worry and and uneasiness and
[1:14:49] apprehension and angst all these are are
[1:14:51] synonyms to fear that comes by by the
[1:14:53] belief that something could be dangerous
[1:14:55] friends you realize but this kind of
[1:14:57] fear it don't come from God this fear
[1:15:00] actually come I can tell you where it
[1:15:01] come from if you want to read it in your
[1:15:03] Bible I won't go read it all this
[1:15:04] morning but but but this fear came after
[1:15:06] the fall in the garden Genesis the third
[1:15:08] chapter it's the first time you ever see
[1:15:09] the word mentioned in the bible here
[1:15:12] Adam and Eve had gone through they had
[1:15:14] communion with the Lord they walk with
[1:15:15] God day and night but after the fall
[1:15:17] when God came down and he began to call
[1:15:19] Adam's name he said Adam Where Art Thou
[1:15:22] the Bible says Adam said said I heard
[1:15:24] thy voice in the garden and I was afraid
[1:15:27] he said why were you afraid why did you
[1:15:28] hide he said I was naked and I was
[1:15:30] afraid isn't it something that it was
[1:15:31] after the fall in the garden that fear
[1:15:34] came in after the fall in the garden all
[1:15:36] of a sudden that a man of God that was a
[1:15:37] man of Courage because because of the
[1:15:39] Fall he he was anointed with a spirit of
[1:15:41] fear and that spirit of fear caused him
[1:15:43] to act out of character it caused him to
[1:15:45] act in ways in a certain way it caused
[1:15:48] him to conduct himself in a certain way
[1:15:49] never had any time that God had ever
[1:15:51] walked down in the garden did he find
[1:15:53] find Adam hiding and not coming to have
[1:15:55] communion with him but because of the
[1:15:56] fear that had struck his heart now no
[1:15:58] longer did he have a desire to have
[1:16:00] communion with God but or he had a
[1:16:02] desire but the fear was greater than the
[1:16:04] desire it was keeping him from from his
[1:16:06] real desire so he hid from it it came
[1:16:08] from the fall in the garden that's why
[1:16:09] Paul would tell us he said God did not
[1:16:12] give us the spirit of fear how many ever
[1:16:14] wonders what Timothy was feeling like
[1:16:16] whenever Paul wrote him that letter
[1:16:17] remember it came in second Timothy he he
[1:16:19] he how many wers what Timothy was going
[1:16:21] through Timothy was a man you think
[1:16:22] about Timothy's life Timothy was a man
[1:16:25] that had that that walked with Paul he
[1:16:27] was the one that Paul had raised up in
[1:16:28] the ministry he called Paul his father
[1:16:30] father in the gospel Paul had trained
[1:16:32] him he had took him and and helped him
[1:16:34] start here Timothy would be a pastor in
[1:16:36] this in the community that he lived in
[1:16:38] Ephesus and and so here as a minister
[1:16:40] and Paul was his father figure and now
[1:16:42] the very man that that was his leader
[1:16:44] was captured and put in prison and was
[1:16:47] for his second time and was waiting on
[1:16:49] his own death even in the letter that
[1:16:50] Paul wrote Paul said they will soon take
[1:16:52] my my life I will no longer be with you
[1:16:55] they'll soon take my life but when he
[1:16:57] writes this to Timothy brother Mark I
[1:16:59] thought here no doubt Timothy was in a
[1:17:01] state of fear Paul didn't know what
[1:17:02] Timothy was going through but by
[1:17:03] discernment this is what he writes to
[1:17:05] Timothy he said when I think of you he
[1:17:07] said I call to my own remembrance the
[1:17:09] unfeigned faith that is in thee he said
[1:17:12] and I put you in remembrance to steer up
[1:17:14] the gift of God which is in thee that I
[1:17:17] that came when I put my hands on you I'm
[1:17:19] reminding you Timothy that there's an
[1:17:21] unfeigned faith when I think about you I
[1:17:23] remember the faith that you had that
[1:17:24] came from God so I'm reminding you to
[1:17:26] remember the gift that God gave you and
[1:17:28] steer it up in you don't don't don't be
[1:17:30] don't be taken down by by whatever this
[1:17:32] feeling is or whatever this fear may be
[1:17:35] he said he said see I remind you he said
[1:17:37] for God has not given us the spirit of
[1:17:39] fear but he gave us the power the spirit
[1:17:42] or the power and love and of a sound
[1:17:44] mind I thought my isn't it something
[1:17:46] here was a man that in his flesh was
[1:17:48] locked up in a prison here his flesh he
[1:17:50] was bound here his flesh he was waiting
[1:17:52] on his own own death but brother Mark
[1:17:54] because he was son of a Son of God he
[1:17:56] wasn't afraid he said he said God didn't
[1:17:58] give us the spirit of fear he said
[1:18:00] therefore listen to the words of
[1:18:02] encouragement coming from a man that was
[1:18:03] about to lose his life a man that ought
[1:18:05] have been afraid a man that ought to
[1:18:07] give in here he was sitting there
[1:18:08] chained up in an old prison cell he said
[1:18:11] but don't be ashamed of the testimony of
[1:18:13] the Lord or me his prisoner he said be a
[1:18:16] partaker of the afflictions of The
[1:18:18] Gospel According to the power of God you
[1:18:20] may go through trials but take the
[1:18:22] trials and be and don't be ashamed you
[1:18:24] may go through TR or trouble but take
[1:18:26] the trouble and don't be ashamed he said
[1:18:28] it's God that has saved us he's called
[1:18:29] us with a holy calling according to our
[1:18:31] work not according to our works but
[1:18:33] according to his own purpose and his
[1:18:34] grace which he has given us in Jesus
[1:18:36] Christ before the world began and he
[1:18:39] made manifest appearing to our savior he
[1:18:41] said who hath abolished death and hath
[1:18:43] brought life and immortality to light
[1:18:45] through the Gospel of Jesus Christ here
[1:18:47] was a man on death row but brother Tom
[1:18:49] he wasn't afraid of it because he said
[1:18:51] Christ came and he brought a revelation
[1:18:53] to my heart that he has abolished death
[1:18:56] and he's brought life and immortality
[1:18:58] through the light of the Gospel this
[1:19:00] that same life that Paul saw when he was
[1:19:02] walking on the road to Damascus but the
[1:19:04] mark he said that Li has brought to me
[1:19:06] the very revelation of life and
[1:19:08] immortality so that's why a man on death
[1:19:10] row could say God has not given us the
[1:19:13] spirit of fear but he gave us the spirit
[1:19:15] of Faith he said you're appointing to be
[1:19:17] a preacher an apostle or I a preacher an
[1:19:19] apostle a teacher to the Gentiles he
[1:19:21] said I I will o separ these things
[1:19:24] nevertheless I'm not ashamed I'm not
[1:19:27] ashamed I know whom I have believed I am
[1:19:30] persuaded that he is able to keep those
[1:19:32] keep that which I have committed unto
[1:19:34] him against the day in other words it
[1:19:36] don't matter what the trial is today God
[1:19:38] is able to keep us against the day he's
[1:19:41] able to keep you against the trial he's
[1:19:43] able to keep you against the the the
[1:19:45] sickness he's able to keep you against
[1:19:47] the problems that we face today he said
[1:19:48] I am committed that God is able to keep
[1:19:51] us against that today so hold fast to
[1:19:55] the form of sound words what you have
[1:19:57] heard of me in faith and in love which
[1:20:01] is in Christ Jesus what a what an order
[1:20:05] hold fast fast the faith that God has
[1:20:08] given you don't have the spirit of fear
[1:20:10] here a man all he had in his possession
[1:20:12] was an ink pen and a piece of paper had
[1:20:15] nothing else a little bit of parchment
[1:20:16] he could write on waiting to beheaded
[1:20:18] and a few days later he was beheaded
[1:20:20] matter of fact there's historians that
[1:20:22] tell us that by the time Timothy ever
[1:20:24] read this letter Paul was already
[1:20:26] dead here he was reading a letter saying
[1:20:30] don't have the spirit of fear but have
[1:20:33] the faith let the faith the gift that
[1:20:35] God has given you Stir It Up don't walk
[1:20:38] around don't don't live in this life
[1:20:40] that way don't have the spirit of fear
[1:20:42] IM it something see if fear is a spirit
[1:20:45] brother Mark what kind of spirit is it
[1:20:47] Anyway anybody want to answer that what
[1:20:50] kind of spirit is it brother bam said
[1:20:52] when he went came to a healing line in
[1:20:53] the message the in Veil people were
[1:20:55] coming to be healed he said you are now
[1:20:57] healed if that shadow would leave you he
[1:21:00] said but as a servant of God I'll pray
[1:21:03] he the people were standing there he
[1:21:04] said you're already healed if you can
[1:21:06] get that shadow to leave you what shadow
[1:21:08] was it that was overshadowing them and
[1:21:10] keeping them from their healing he said
[1:21:11] what shadow is it he said I'll pray and
[1:21:14] ask God to cast that demon of
[1:21:16] fear that's afraid to take God at his
[1:21:19] word afraid that you can't get along
[1:21:22] afraid afraid that you just can't make
[1:21:23] it afraid that you just can't believe
[1:21:25] God afraid that God just won't bring you
[1:21:27] through afraid that God won't keep you
[1:21:29] afraid that you can't make it to another
[1:21:30] day he said as a servant of God I'll
[1:21:32] pray and ask God to take that Spirit or
[1:21:34] that demon of fear take it from you he
[1:21:38] said there and I believe God will heal
[1:21:40] every one of you and you'll get up from
[1:21:42] here tonight and you'll walk out and be
[1:21:43] well see we have a different pattern
[1:21:46] than the world has but wesy our pattern
[1:21:48] we're led by a different Spirit the
[1:21:50] Bible says I got just a few minutes I'm
[1:21:52] not going to hold you long I know what
[1:21:53] time it is he the Bible says the that
[1:21:56] that we're led by a different Spirit
[1:21:57] brother Mark the sons of God are led by
[1:21:59] the spirit of God see Paul said don't be
[1:22:01] led by the spirit of fear the Bible says
[1:22:02] we're to be led by the spirit of God and
[1:22:04] the spirit of God it always leads you
[1:22:06] where back to the word of God so
[1:22:08] whenever you get a little bit off you
[1:22:09] don't have to worry about Spirit of
[1:22:10] God's going to come by he's going to
[1:22:11] lead you back to the word so you that's
[1:22:13] what Jesus said he said follow me
[1:22:15] brother B said that's the only remedy we
[1:22:17] God's ever gave to anybody was to follow
[1:22:19] Jesus Christ it's to follow the word he
[1:22:20] said we must follow him it's the only
[1:22:23] way to have eternal life we follow him
[1:22:25] it's the only way to Healing it's the
[1:22:26] only way the only way for your for your
[1:22:28] trouble to be over it's the only way to
[1:22:30] get out of the valley it's the only way
[1:22:31] to be able to overcome he said follow
[1:22:33] him it's the only way that we'll be able
[1:22:35] to to get anything from God and we must
[1:22:37] follow Jesus Christ and and brother B
[1:22:39] says so the leadership of God is to
[1:22:41] follow the vindicative word of the hour
[1:22:43] by the Holy Ghost In other words brother
[1:22:45] Wesley it's the very spirit of God that
[1:22:48] comes into the Believers to lead you out
[1:22:50] of a state of fear it's the spirit of
[1:22:52] God God that leads you out of your
[1:22:54] condition it leads you out of the the
[1:22:56] mindset of the world and the ideology of
[1:22:58] the world and the Theology of the world
[1:23:00] it's the spirit of God that leads us so
[1:23:02] friends it don't matter what kind of
[1:23:03] condition that you ever get in it may
[1:23:04] not be today it may not have been
[1:23:06] yesterday it might come to you tomorrow
[1:23:08] but I want to remind you as a gospel
[1:23:10] preacher it don't matter what's
[1:23:11] surrounding you it don't matter what

[1:23:14] bad it is or how bad it seems if if
[1:23:17] you're surrounded by doubt or surrounded

[1:23:31] situation but the word of God will lead
[1:23:33] you out every time it don't matter how
[1:23:35] deep you get into it the word of God

[1:23:50] something about God let me tell you what
[1:23:52] he does the spirit of God will take the
[1:23:53] word of God and he'll walk right down

[1:23:58] going on in your house and he'll turn
[1:24:00] around and take you by the hand and
[1:24:01] he'll lead you out of the house that's
[1:24:03] what he done when he went into gyus his
[1:24:04] daughter here she was laying on her
[1:24:06] deathbed but Jesus walked right into the
[1:24:08] condition they were in and he took her
[1:24:10] by the hand he said
[1:24:12] arise and be well yes sir he comes in
[1:24:16] right where we live that's what we need
[1:24:18] we need a we need the preaching that
[1:24:19] comes in where we live I I I know I I
[1:24:21] sure love preaching that makes you feel
[1:24:23] good too but sometimes we just need
[1:24:24] preaching that goes right down where you
[1:24:26] live and correct the way we live and
[1:24:28] take the things of the world and take
[1:24:29] them off of us friends we can't make
[1:24:31] make a Rapture all tied down to the
[1:24:32] world we got to be set
[1:24:35] free he'll come down into the condition
[1:24:37] and bring you out think about this is
[1:24:40] this is where Rahab
[1:24:42] was this is here on the outside you look
[1:24:45] at this girl she was a she was a harlot
[1:24:47] an ill- famed woman and here in this you
[1:24:50] you think of this that that that here
[1:24:52] here she was in this life I don't know
[1:24:53] what happened in her childhood and all
[1:24:55] the things that transpired in her life
[1:24:57] to cause her to be in the condition that
[1:24:58] she was in but God saw the condition she
[1:25:02] was in and here I thought isn't it
[1:25:04] something that out of all of Jericho and
[1:25:06] all the homes and all the houses that
[1:25:09] these two men could go to they went to
[1:25:11] the rahab's house and here as they were
[1:25:14] they were in there I thought here here
[1:25:16] they come Joshua had given them an order
[1:25:18] here they're coming the the army of
[1:25:19] Israel is on the outside of Jericho
[1:25:21] knocking on the door
[1:25:22] they they knew they were coming they
[1:25:24] they knew they had no defense against it
[1:25:26] and so here they were they were waiting
[1:25:28] on this and know these two spies they
[1:25:29] enter in brother Mark and they make
[1:25:31] their way down to this house and so as
[1:25:33] they they get in they go in there and
[1:25:35] and all of a sudden they realize that
[1:25:37] that what's about to happen you realize
[1:25:38] there was a great fear in the land of
[1:25:40] Jericho but notice I want you to see
[1:25:42] something that it wasn't just Jericho
[1:25:44] that was afraid whenever Rahab speaks to
[1:25:47] these men listen what she says she says
[1:25:50] for We Have Heard how the Lord dried up
[1:25:53] the water and Y brought y'all out of
[1:25:55] Egypt and as soon as we had heard these
[1:25:58] things our hearts did melt it wasn't
[1:26:02] just the rest of Jericho but Rahab was
[1:26:04] right in the mix we heard about it and
[1:26:06] our hearts didn't melt she was afraid
[1:26:10] but Mark the the the nation was afraid
[1:26:12] they were they were living in the same
[1:26:14] state she was she was living in the same
[1:26:16] state of fear that they were living in
[1:26:18] but there was one difference between
[1:26:19] Rahab and all the rest of the people in
[1:26:21] Jericho
[1:26:23] is that brother Mark how many knows what
[1:26:24] that difference was Rahab was
[1:26:27] predestinated by God so even though they
[1:26:30] were all living under the same spirit
[1:26:31] that Rahab was living under but she was
[1:26:33] predestinated by God she belonged to God
[1:26:36] before the foundation of the world don't
[1:26:37] think things caught God off guard Paul
[1:26:39] said we were predestinated Why by God's
[1:26:41] forn knowledge God knew who we were he
[1:26:43] knew everything we'd ever go through he
[1:26:44] know the very thoughts that you would
[1:26:45] think God is an eternal God he said God
[1:26:48] knows this and and and and Rahab was
[1:26:51] predestinated by God matter of fact the
[1:26:52] Bible says that she perished not with
[1:26:55] them who believe not but she believed
[1:26:57] brother said she believed the message of
[1:26:59] the hour think about Rahab here she come
[1:27:02] brother Mark she believed the message of
[1:27:04] the hour she was in a she was in a
[1:27:05] condition she was walled in in a city
[1:27:08] she was living in a in a harlot's house
[1:27:10] she was living a harlot's life she was
[1:27:12] she was living in a state of fear it was
[1:27:14] a terrible condition he said but she
[1:27:16] believed the message of the hour my I
[1:27:18] thought my here here here come these two
[1:27:20] Preachers by our house and they begin to
[1:27:22] talk to her about about the the the the
[1:27:24] the army of of Israel and how they were
[1:27:26] out on the outside and and he said but
[1:27:28] by faith she believed the message of God
[1:27:31] in her condition and she was saved man
[1:27:34] isn't that something he said she didn't
[1:27:35] have to go get right somewhere in order
[1:27:37] to start believing but in her condition
[1:27:39] she believed and my friends don't you
[1:27:41] see don't you hear it this morning in
[1:27:43] the middle of your sickness she believed
[1:27:45] in the middle of your trial she believed
[1:27:47] in the middle of being down she believed
[1:27:49] in the middle of your sin in the middle
[1:27:51] of the problems and tri but Mark she
[1:27:53] believed in her condition and she was
[1:27:56] saved God knew her condition but man
[1:27:59] said that great Harlot Rahab listen she
[1:28:01] become a Believer he said I look through
[1:28:03] her history think about this woman you
[1:28:05] know how many knows what Rahab was Rahab
[1:28:08] became a proelite of Israel how me
[1:28:10] that's a good thing by the way I know
[1:28:11] that people misunderstand that word a
[1:28:13] lot today but but a proelite means that
[1:28:16] you change somebody from one belief to
[1:28:18] another now I know Jesus said that that
[1:28:20] the the Jews had made people because
[1:28:22] they were proales they were two-fold
[1:28:23] Childs of Hell let me quickly explain
[1:28:25] that the reason he said that was because
[1:28:27] they were taking them out of one thing
[1:28:29] that was wrong and bringing them into
[1:28:31] their own denomination of Judaism
[1:28:33] instead of bringing them into Christ he
[1:28:35] said see so you've made them a proelite
[1:28:37] into your belief and now they're a
[1:28:39] two-fold child of hell cuz they was
[1:28:40] wrong before and they're wrong now but a
[1:28:42] true proelite is to bring them into
[1:28:43] truth to bring people to Christ that's
[1:28:45] what we ought to be doing we ought to be
[1:28:47] bringing people out of the belief of the
[1:28:49] world and out of the ideology of the
[1:28:51] world and bringing them to of Christ
[1:28:52] that's what we ought to do butam says
[1:28:54] see because of her belief in God she was
[1:28:56] an Israelite she was brought into the
[1:28:57] Israelite Faith she was a proelite of
[1:28:59] Israel she courted a general in the army
[1:29:02] of the Israelite Army and watch what God
[1:29:03] did for that woman she moved to
[1:29:05] Bethlehem and here when she moved to
[1:29:07] Bethlehem they had a son look this
[1:29:09] little Rahab woman that that was in this
[1:29:11] condition that was walled in in a spirit
[1:29:12] of fear that had no way out she moved to
[1:29:14] Bethlehem she had a son by the name of
[1:29:17] Boaz Boaz married Ruth and then they had
[1:29:19] a they had a son by the name of Jesse
[1:29:22] and Jesse had a son by the name of David
[1:29:24] and out of the lineage lineage of David
[1:29:26] here he said here come Jesus he said why
[1:29:28] is it here from this woman that was in
[1:29:30] this condition down through her lineage
[1:29:32] come a man that we call Jesus Christ my
[1:29:35] da make every believer shall he said why
[1:29:37] because Faith cometh by hearing of the
[1:29:40] word of God it cometh by hearing of God
[1:29:42] that God is a god of Heaven and Earth
[1:29:44] and believing on him and that's what
[1:29:46] Rahab done it didn't matter what she was
[1:29:48] before it didn't matter what condition
[1:29:50] she was in it didn't matter that she
[1:29:52] couldn't get out of it and she had no
[1:29:53] way out of it What mattered was is she
[1:29:55] heard the preaching of the word of God
[1:29:57] from a couple of spies that came into
[1:29:59] the land and she believed the word that
[1:30:01] they told her and God brought her out he
[1:30:05] said what what made her a real believer
[1:30:06] let me tell you what made her a real
[1:30:07] believer he said Rahab become a Believer
[1:30:10] what made her a real believer he brother
[1:30:12] man said see Rahab she was a type of the
[1:30:14] believer today she's a real believer
[1:30:17] that's your type Rahab was a type of the
[1:30:19] believer today she's your type every one
[1:30:22] of us come out of something we come out
[1:30:23] of some condition or another but she's
[1:30:25] the type of the real believer you say
[1:30:27] well what made her a real believer
[1:30:28] because when she heard of the things of
[1:30:30] God she believed it isn't that something
[1:30:33] God corrected her wrong and she accepted
[1:30:36] the correction she heard of the
[1:30:38] supernatural she believed it she heard
[1:30:40] the miraculous she believed it he said
[1:30:42] look look at Rahab have mercy on me
[1:30:44] spare me I don't want to die with these
[1:30:45] unbelievers I don't want to die as an
[1:30:47] animal but let me die in the arms of
[1:30:49] Jehovah God I believe you're God God
[1:30:52] he's both God Of Heaven and Earth he
[1:30:54] does visible things he makes things real
[1:30:56] think about Rahab what she testifies of
[1:30:59] brother wesy here no wonder she was the
[1:31:01] type of the True Believer she was
[1:31:03] testifying of things she had never saw
[1:31:06] amen somebody she never saw it she never
[1:31:09] seen Joshua she just heard of Joshua she
[1:31:12] didn't know what he looked like she
[1:31:13] didn't know how strong he really was she
[1:31:14] didn't know how power how a mighty man
[1:31:16] of God that he was she'd never seen him
[1:31:18] she never met Joshua but she believed
[1:31:21] she never never seen the Red Sea open
[1:31:23] but she believed it she never seen the
[1:31:24] army take over another Nation but she
[1:31:26] believed it she she never seen God she
[1:31:28] heard of God she never seen the works of
[1:31:30] God she just heard of it others had seen
[1:31:32] it but brother bam said but what was the
[1:31:34] difference with her is she believed by
[1:31:36] hearing it isn't that what the Bible
[1:31:38] says faith cometh by hearing the word it
[1:31:42] wasn't that she seen some great Miracles
[1:31:44] or seen some great move of God brother
[1:31:46] Dave Paul she believed it because she
[1:31:47] heard the word and let me tell you
[1:31:49] friends when that Faith came to that
[1:31:52] little harlot's house I wish I had an
[1:31:54] hour to preach on faith coming to the
[1:31:57] harlot's house now when Faith came into
[1:31:59] her house it changed everything it
[1:32:03] didn't just save her brother B it saved
[1:32:05] her entire family When Faith entered her
[1:32:08] house it saved her family butam said see
[1:32:11] why he said because if you've got enough
[1:32:13] Faith to save yourself then you can have
[1:32:14] enough faith for your family to be saved
[1:32:16] too my isn't that something if you have
[1:32:19] enough Faith to save yourself then you
[1:32:21] can have enough Faith to save your
[1:32:22] family he said thou and thy house isn't
[1:32:25] that isn't that isn't that what he told
[1:32:26] the the the Centurion when he came he
[1:32:28] said thy and thy house shall be
[1:32:31] saved then he told them those men those
[1:32:34] spies as they're preaching to her what
[1:32:36] do we got to do to be saved she said
[1:32:38] said well as they let her down on the
[1:32:40] Scarlet thread out the window they went
[1:32:43] men had run off into the Wilderness
[1:32:45] looking for him she let them stay there
[1:32:47] and then they escaped in the middle of
[1:32:48] the night they said you take this token
[1:32:50] this thre bread and you hang it out your
[1:32:52] window and when we come in this army's
[1:32:55] coming we're going to make a vow to you
[1:32:56] that your family will be saved don't you
[1:32:59] realize what's happening look at what
[1:33:00] she was living in here are these men of
[1:33:03] God preachers that's the way the prophet
[1:33:04] typed on they were the preachers in the
[1:33:06] end time it was an imminent judgment she
[1:33:09] lived in the age of judgment coming on
[1:33:11] Jericho and these preachers were
[1:33:12] standing in just like preachers today
[1:33:14] standing in the pull pit saying judgment
[1:33:16] is imminent the Judgment of God is
[1:33:18] coming Upon This land but if you'll let
[1:33:20] this scarlet cord hang out your window
[1:33:22] God will honor it the army of Israel
[1:33:24] when they come in there won't be a
[1:33:25] single soldier that'll ever touch your
[1:33:27] house there won't be a single Rock
[1:33:30] that'll ever fall off your house there
[1:33:32] there won't no judgment come to thy
[1:33:33] house if you'll display this token
[1:33:37] establish your house and let the token
[1:33:39] be on display my isn't it something here
[1:33:42] here they came and she took this Scarlet
[1:33:44] thread brother Mark she hung it out the
[1:33:46] window those preachers when they came
[1:33:49] here they were telling her if you want
[1:33:50] them to be saved get them in here behind
[1:33:51] the token if you want your family to be
[1:33:53] saved get them in the house see it's up
[1:33:55] to the preacher brother Mark to testify
[1:33:57] The Works of God and it's up the
[1:33:59] preacher to to testify the the Holy
[1:34:01] Ghost is on its way and and God's the
[1:34:03] Judgment of God's on its way and they
[1:34:05] can tell testimonies and they they can
[1:34:07] do all that but it's up to you to
[1:34:08] believe it she had to she had to do it
[1:34:10] she had to she had some action she had
[1:34:11] to take the thread and hang it out of

[1:38:22] acquainted with the word of God we need
[1:38:24] those that aren't ashamed to be
[1:38:25] acquainted with the message of the hour
[1:38:27] he said see what we need tonight is a
[1:38:29] sign that a man or a woman is saved he
[1:38:32] said what is the sign is that they go
[1:38:33] after other Souls as quick as they can

[1:38:38] life they go they have a desire to win
[1:38:40] souls see your sign is what displays who

[1:38:52] the whole rest of the world well what
[1:38:53] are they seeing so let your light shine

[1:39:06] ashamed don't be ashamed to display the
[1:39:09] token don't be ashamed you know what you
[1:39:12] know what Rahab done she took that sign
[1:39:15] that Harlot sign out of her window and
[1:39:17] she replaced it with a Scarlet thread
[1:39:19] she replaced it with a token
[1:39:21] she took that old life out of her window
[1:39:23] she replaced it with something else you
[1:39:25] know what the sign is you remember
[1:39:27] remember the story that I believe
[1:39:28] brother bil Graham had told the story
[1:39:30] about the about the man that that had
[1:39:32] went down and and or the little boy went
[1:39:35] or walked by a bar one time and he
[1:39:36] walked into the bartender in there and
[1:39:38] he said you know sir he said your sign's
[1:39:40] down outside and so the bartender went
[1:39:43] out there and he looked up and had that
[1:39:44] old nice sign up there hanging he said
[1:39:46] well he said no my sign's still up there
[1:39:48] buddy he said everything's fine and the
[1:39:50] little boy looked over and there was a
[1:39:51] drunk laying in the gutter he said no
[1:39:53] I'm talking about your real sign he said
[1:39:55] that guy right there he he said your
[1:39:57] sign's down just kind of joking around
[1:40:00] he said see but that is't that the way
[1:40:01] it is Bram said that's the way it is a
[1:40:03] man under the influence of what you're
[1:40:06] selling on the inside is the best sign
[1:40:08] that you have a man under the influence
[1:40:11] of what you're selling is the best sign
[1:40:14] you have he said so when we see a man
[1:40:16] under the influence of the Holy Spirit
[1:40:18] until his life is burning with an
[1:40:19] oldfashioned Pentecost to fire that's
[1:40:22] the best sign God ever had that a man is
[1:40:24] saved it's the best sign how how will
[1:40:27] that come about it won't come by joining
[1:40:28] a church it won't come by anything but
[1:40:31] accepting his pardon through Jesus
[1:40:33] Christ your innocent substitute there
[1:40:35] ain't one place you can get it it's
[1:40:36] Jesus Christ and him alone no church can
[1:40:38] give it to you no preacher can give it
[1:40:40] to you no Prophet can give it to you the
[1:40:42] only way you'll get it is accepting your
[1:40:44] pardon through Jesus Christ but Mark
[1:40:47] here's what Rahab she heard the message
[1:40:49] of the hour and she believed it she took
[1:40:51] that old sign down she hung her token
[1:40:53] down said see that token that same token
[1:40:56] that we're holding on to today if the
[1:40:57] music players would come that same thing

[1:41:09] sometimes we get out of line and
[1:41:11] sometimes we get out of character
[1:41:12] sometimes we get crossed with one
[1:41:13] another because we're men and women but
[1:41:16] because we're Believers we overcome
[1:41:17] those things we come together we put our

[1:41:48] something about that Scarlet thread he
[1:41:50] said that's that Scarlet thread it
[1:41:52] weaves all the way through the Bible
[1:41:55] from Genesis to
[1:41:56] Revelation it ties the whole scripture
[1:41:58] together that Scarlet thread right
[1:42:00] through the cross of Calvary weaves all
[1:42:03] the way to the very beginning that way
[1:42:05] nobody would miss it it's the token that
[1:42:08] we have on
[1:42:09] display said you know when this is what
[1:42:12] God done just like he did with Rahab he
[1:42:14] saw you and he knowed you wanted to be
[1:42:18] saved he saw you in your condition
[1:42:20] listen little
[1:42:22] Rahab he knowed you wanted to be saved
[1:42:25] and the only thing he could do was to go
[1:42:27] down
[1:42:28] his he had a son born and a body of
[1:42:31] flesh made like those men he said that
[1:42:34] was the antidote for God himself to
[1:42:36] become sin that he might pay the price
[1:42:39] cuz it wouldn't it would take the
[1:42:41] highest thing there is to lift man out
[1:42:43] of their condition it took the highest
[1:42:46] power the greatest
[1:42:48] power the greatest thing there ever was
[1:42:50] for the mark it took him it took the one
[1:42:52] that was above every Angel he was above
[1:42:55] every Archangel he was the highest that
[1:42:56] there ever was and he came down and
[1:42:59] became the lowest isn't it something you
[1:43:01] know how low Jesus went he went all the
[1:43:04] way down brother Mark to the lowest city
[1:43:06] on earth which was the city of Jericho
[1:43:07] it's 850 ft below sea level Jesus walked
[1:43:10] down into Jericho the lowest city on
[1:43:12] planet Earth and he went below the
[1:43:14] lowest man up there by the name of
[1:43:15] zachus to even zachus had to look down
[1:43:18] on him that's how low Jesus went
[1:43:21] the greatest man that there ever was
[1:43:23] became the lowest of the low that he
[1:43:26] could bring us out said he came the
[1:43:28] richest became the
[1:43:30] poorest even one stormy night he said
[1:43:33] the bird has a nest the foxes have a den
[1:43:36] he said I don't even have a place to lay
[1:43:37] my head the highest of the heavens
[1:43:39] became the lowest of all lows even
[1:43:42] animals had privilege above him as far
[1:43:45] as the Comforts of this life he became
[1:43:47] the lowest of the low said but that
[1:43:51] wasn't the end of
[1:43:53] it as low as he lived it wasn't the end
[1:43:56] of it but the Jared he even went lower
[1:43:58] than
[1:43:59] that he went down on calvary's Cross he
[1:44:03] allowed him to take his life and he
[1:44:05] suffered the the death of the Cross when
[1:44:08] he did he went down into hell in the
[1:44:10] lowest parts of Hell to set captives
[1:44:13] free it didn't matter how low you are it
[1:44:16] don't matter how low you've been there
[1:44:17] ain't nobody that is too low for Jesus
[1:44:20] Jesus to go he went to the lowest
[1:44:24] Prophet said you know where what he did
[1:44:25] I love this he said he went down he said
[1:44:28] here's what he did he took a hold he
[1:44:30] took a hold of a string he took a thread
[1:44:33] and he went all the way down to the
[1:44:34] lowest parts of Hell to where there
[1:44:36] wasn't nothing else that person in their
[1:44:38] lowest condition could get a hold of it
[1:44:40] said then he then he then he resurrected
[1:44:44] and when he resurrected he brought that
[1:44:45] string that was that was all the way
[1:44:47] down in the bottom he left a knot on it
[1:44:49] down there in the bottom and he took
[1:44:50] that string through his resurrection and
[1:44:52] he ascended into glory on the throne of
[1:44:54] God he said and from all the way the
[1:44:56] Bottomless Pits of Hell into the Throne
[1:44:58] of God he has that string that's
[1:45:00] attached all the way down he said it's
[1:45:02] the very threat of God it's that same
[1:45:04] Scarlet core he made a high way that men
[1:45:07] and women could be saved he said but one
[1:45:09] day soon don't you worry God is going to
[1:45:11] pull on that cord and everything that's
[1:45:14] attached to it is going to go be with
[1:45:15] him in glory there ain't not one that'll
[1:45:17] be lost from the lowest pits of hell it
[1:45:20] don't matter how deep she was in the
[1:45:22] middle of Jericho it don't matter how
[1:45:24] big of of deep of a pit that you're in
[1:45:26] from the lowest pits of hell and one day
[1:45:28] he'll pull it and every one of us will
[1:45:30] come out of it you say but matter what I
[1:45:32] do you get a hold of the cord that God's
[1:45:34] laid down it's the lifeline that God has
[1:45:36] sent down to humanity maybe you just
[1:45:38] stand to your feet today it's a Lifeline
[1:45:40] that God has given us I wonder if
[1:45:42] somebody lift their hand and take a hold
[1:45:44] of it this morning the fountain that's
[1:45:46] filled with blood he said he came down
[1:45:48] the very one that was at the beginning
[1:45:50] of time one day he'll stand at the
[1:45:52] Ancient of Days and he'll pull that
[1:45:54] great gospel cord and all that's on that
[1:45:57] highway from the beginning of time to
[1:45:58] the end time they'll be lifted up he'll
[1:46:01] draw them out of existence and right
[1:46:03] into eternity again that's our God it's
[1:46:08] our token don't be ashamed of it this
[1:46:11] morning then I don't know about y'all
[1:46:13] but I feel the pull of it glory to God I
[1:46:16] feel the pull of it I I I'm not just

[1:46:28] the pull of the cord what's what's
[1:46:31] dealing with you why why what what's
[1:46:32] causing you to want to serve God it's
[1:46:34] the pull of the cord brother Mark right
[1:46:36] in the imminent judgment is the very
[1:46:38] thing that'll bring you
[1:46:40] out oh my let me tell you what Joshua

[1:47:06] strength she had a better
[1:47:08] Mason she had a better Stone Mason than

[1:50:10] begin to fade into that Immortal body
[1:50:12] and you'll turn around look and you'll
[1:50:13] see your loved one standing around in
[1:50:15] your house other ways he said you know
[1:50:17] what he said you'll sit there one day
[1:50:18] and one of your loved ones will come on
[1:50:20] and when they do it'll give you enough
[1:50:21] faith that that'll start happening to
[1:50:23] you I don't care which way it is some of
[1:50:25] you may need that to have faith some of
[1:50:27] you may have enough fate to see it
[1:50:29] already but I can promise you this one
[1:50:31] day your loved ones will stand in your
[1:50:33] living room they'll stand in your
[1:50:34] bedroom in the middle of the night and
[1:50:36] brother Mark right in the middle of one
[1:50:38] morning when you you think you've gone
[1:50:40] as far as you can go and you don't think
[1:50:41] you can make it another day the very
[1:50:43] dearest ones to your heart will be
[1:50:44] standing there saying hey wake up it's
[1:50:46] time to go there's a knock on the door
[1:50:50] the Judgment of God is coming to this
[1:50:52] land but he's calling you out I promise
[1:50:55] you
[1:50:57] that I don't know a lot of things but I
[1:50:59] can promise you that I'm not ashamed to
[1:51:01] stand with the Gospel of Jesus Christ
[1:51:04] Paul said he's he's given us something
[1:51:06] greater it's immortality in
[1:51:09] life not to be bound by
[1:51:12] death my even just talking about them
[1:51:14] they gather around where we are the
[1:51:17] angels of heaven can gather around our
[1:51:19] loved ones gather around the meetings if
[1:51:20] you could see what's in this meeting
[1:51:22] this morning if you could see those that
[1:51:25] are gathering around you in this meeting
[1:51:27] this morning it's like it's like Elijah
[1:51:30] that one time when he told the prophets
[1:51:32] or the the servants Eyes Lord would you
[1:51:33] open his eyes that he could really see
[1:51:36] the prophet didn't go out there and look
[1:51:37] and see what it was he just believed by
[1:51:38] faith that they were there he didn't
[1:51:40] have to go outside he believed it by
[1:51:42] faith that's what Rahab done she heard
[1:51:45] and she believed it by faith I wonder
[1:51:46] how many this morning can be like that
[1:51:48] Prophet was and say I'll just believe it
[1:51:49] by faith faith I can't see them but
[1:51:51] they're there I can't see the Angels but
[1:51:54] they're there when I'm in the M middle
[1:51:56] of trouble I can't see God but he's
[1:51:58] there he's there all the
[1:52:01] time calling us
[1:52:03] out
[1:52:05] ah he's here this morning isn't it
[1:52:08] something to serve a God he said he
[1:52:11] won't leave you in that
[1:52:13] state I'm waiting on that
[1:52:16] knock I'm going to walk in and I'm not
[1:52:18] going to be ashamed I'm going to be a
[1:52:20] real Soldier I'm going to do my best I
[1:52:22] may fall flat on my face sometimes
[1:52:24] sometimes I let y'all down I don't mean
[1:52:26] to I pray you forgive me for it
[1:52:28] sometimes I Don't Preach good enough I
[1:52:30] go home and think my they need to find a
[1:52:32] better preacher sit there and think all
[1:52:34] the what I could have said and what I
[1:52:36] could have been a little bit better
[1:52:37] maybe I should have slowed down maybe I
[1:52:39] should have sped up maybe it would have
[1:52:41] been better maybe the people would have
[1:52:42] received it better maybe that it would
[1:52:44] have been a little bit better for him
[1:52:46] every time I almost I think that way I
[1:52:48] don't ever feel like I'm good enough for
[1:52:50] that but I know this I want to stand for
[1:52:53] the
[1:52:54] Lord I'm not ashamed of the Gospel I
[1:52:58] encourage you this morning take a hold
[1:52:59] of it be not
