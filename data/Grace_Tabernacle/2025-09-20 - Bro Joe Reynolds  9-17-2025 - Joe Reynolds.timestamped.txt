[22:33] presence once again this evening to
[22:35] realize he's not dead. He's very much
[22:37] alive and he's wanting to give it to you
[22:40] more than you want it tonight. How many

[22:54] of the Lord with you. And it's good to
[22:57] be back home. We've been on vacation for
[22:59] over a week with some friends and a
[23:01] couple ministering brothers and just had
[23:03] a really good time and
[23:06] just been in prayer for brother Andrew
[23:08] and his family and
[23:11] he uh had to take his son to the
[23:13] hospital last night and broke his femur
[23:15] bones. Just remember him in prayer and

[23:37] all about. God got it all in control.
[23:40] He's mindful each and every one of our
[23:42] needs tonight. If you got a need, won't
[23:43] you just make it known to the Lord? And
[23:45] I know he's more than able to meet each
[23:48] and every one of our needs tonight. God
[23:50] sees every one of your hands. Lord
[23:51] Jesus, we thank you for this time that
[23:54] you have given us, Father, to worship
[23:56] you in spirit and true. Father, we pray,
[23:59] Lord God, tonight, Lord God, that you'll
[24:01] come down in a unique, special way, Lord
[24:03] God, and minister to the hearts of the
[24:05] saints here tonight, Lord God. We pray,
[24:08] Lord God, for brother Andrew's little
[24:10] son, Lord God, that you would mend his
[24:12] leg back normally, Lord God. Let it be a
[24:14] fast recovery, Lord, that your hand be
[24:16] upon his little sweetheart, Lord, and
[24:19] face coming up this week, Lord. We pray,
[24:21] Lord God, that you'll be in every
[24:22] decision. Give them traveling mercies.
[24:25] Lord, we pray for our pastor, Lord, has
[24:27] uh gone down to spend a few time days
[24:29] with his family. Lord, we pray that
[24:31] you'd be with them and their fellowship
[24:33] and give them traveling mercy as well.
[24:35] Lord, we're here tonight, Lord God,
[24:37] expecting great things again in the
[24:39] house of you, Lord God. We commit this
[24:41] time to you, Lord Jesus. Every hand that
[24:44] is risen, Lord, we pray that you'll
[24:46] minister to their needs tonight and meet
[24:48] them here this evening. We ask in Jesus
[24:51] Christ's wonderful name. And the bride
[24:54] says,
[24:55] &gt;&gt; "Amen." Can you give the Lord a hand
[24:57] clap or praise this evening?
[25:01] Amen.
[25:03] You got your Bibles tonight and invite
[25:05] you back to Ephesians chapter 6
[25:12] verse 10.
[25:22] It's good to be in the house of the Lord
[25:24] tonight.
[25:25] &gt;&gt; Amen. How many joys feeling his
[25:27] presence? Amen. Joining together and
[25:30] joining our licks of fire together and
[25:32] just expecting God to do some great
[25:35] things and Amen. That's what it's all
[25:37] about. And hope we never allow it to
[25:40] become a ritual to us. And amen, every
[25:42] service is unique. is specially designed
[25:44] by the father. And we uh we understand
[25:47] those things tonight. We we sure
[25:49] appreciate you tonight. Ephesians
[25:51] chapter 6 verse 10 said, "Finally, my
[25:53] brother, be strong in the Lord and the
[25:56] power of his might, and put on the whole
[25:59] armor of God that you may be able to
[26:00] stand against the ws of the devil. For
[26:03] we wrestle not against flesh and blood,
[26:05] against principalities, against powers,
[26:08] against rulers of darkness of this
[26:10] world, against spiritual wickedness in
[26:12] high places. Wherefore take you on the
[26:15] whole armor of God, that you may be able
[26:17] to withstand in the evil day, and have
[26:19] done all to stand. Stand therefore,
[26:21] having your lo loins gird about with
[26:23] truth, and having the breastplaced of
[26:25] righteousness, and your feet shaw with
[26:27] the preparation of the gospel of peace,
[26:29] and above all, taking the shield of
[26:31] faith, where you shall be able to quench
[26:33] all the fiery darts of the wicked, and
[26:36] take the helmet of salvation, and the
[26:39] sword of the spirit, which is his word,
[26:42] which is the word of God. Amen. If you
[26:45] can have your seats tonight, just ask
[26:47] the Lord to bless the reading of his
[26:49] word. And we took these scriptures last
[26:51] time we was with you a few weeks back.
[26:53] And we just like to pick it back up here
[26:57] again tonight by his grace and looking
[26:59] at a few things the last several days.
[27:01] And just uh been burning on our hearts
[27:04] and but we like to preach it once again
[27:07] on the bride's arsenal. And we uh we
[27:10] spoke last time on the arsenal is array
[27:12] of resources available for a certain
[27:15] purpose. And we realize even as brother
[27:18] we would take us many times back to the
[27:20] military back to to the times he said he
[27:23] would make a statement like this you
[27:25] know United States gives their military
[27:27] the best he can. And he says you know
[27:29] that that they're always trying to
[27:31] revolve. Brother Brian they're always
[27:33] trying to get better. They're always
[27:34] trying to get greater. But he said, you
[27:36] know, God gave us the best. He can give
[27:38] you to sweep you all the way from the
[27:40] Garden of Eden and to the rapture. And
[27:42] he said, it was his word. And his word
[27:44] can defeat Satan any place, under any
[27:46] conditions, any time. It doesn't matter.
[27:49] It's a ray of resources for a certain
[27:51] moment or a certain time. It's a
[27:53] predestinated moment in your journey.
[27:56] Amen. That God knew that you was going
[27:58] to be facing something that you never
[28:00] knew was coming. But God who's rich in
[28:02] mercy had an array of resources for a
[28:06] certain purpose and that purpose was
[28:08] you.
[28:09] &gt;&gt; Amen. So in a in a military sense as we
[28:12] mentioned last time we was with you and
[28:14] know it was a time where it was uh uh uh
[28:17] President Trump was meeting with
[28:18] Russia's uh uh president and
[28:22] &gt;&gt; and and just a show of strength. They
[28:25] would they flew over a couple B2 bombers
[28:27] and and and and I thought of about the
[28:30] how how how powerful a B2 bomber been
[28:33] around many years and Amen. And and and
[28:36] we had these big bunker uh buster bombs
[28:38] that they just uh flew across for 30hour
[28:41] flights over to Iran and dropped them in
[28:44] a certain uh location. It was array of
[28:47] resources for a certain purpose. Yet
[28:49] they never used those bunker bombs
[28:51] before. But when that certain time came,
[28:55] they had array of resources. Amen. And I
[28:58] believe that's a way in in the in the
[29:00] time of darkness, in a time of such
[29:03] gloom and doom in the age that we're
[29:05] living in. Amen. I believe we got the
[29:08] most powerful voice called the message
[29:10] of the hour. How many believes the
[29:11] message is powerful tonight? Amen. We
[29:14] have it on pages. We have it on tapes.
[29:17] Amen. But today, what about
[29:18] manifestation? You are the final voice
[29:21] to the final age. And if that message is
[29:24] powerful, what about you and I tonight?
[29:27] Manifestations of that very voice of the
[29:30] message of the hour. A vindication that
[29:32] God's not dead. Brother, he's very much
[29:35] alive.
[29:37] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Amen. What brother said, we
[29:40] want thousands of lit voices. I ask you
[29:42] to look around Grace Tabernacle tonight.
[29:45] Amen. It's not just on pages any longer.
[29:48] We are yet church. Amen. We are that
[29:51] church. Amen. For a final age under a
[29:54] final time in a final moment. Amen. When
[29:57] it looks like there's no hope, God's got
[29:59] array of resources. Amen. And nothing
[30:02] hell can throw at our way that our God
[30:05] who's rich in mercy has already
[30:08] predestinated array of resources to meet
[30:11] the challenge of this age.
[30:15] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. in such a time as this.
[30:18] Amen. This bride is the very product of
[30:21] that voice of Malachi 4. Can you say
[30:23] amen?
[30:25] &gt;&gt; We realize in the age that we're living
[30:27] in, it's a technology and it's it's
[30:31] quickly advancing. Amen. We can look at
[30:34] AI and how technology is is going so
[30:37] far. And as as you get older, you can
[30:40] begin to look back, you know, when we
[30:41] was young kids. Amen. and and and to
[30:45] where we are now and how much, you know,
[30:47] that education and knowledge has
[30:50] unraveled. And who ever thought that
[30:52] we'd have cell phones and internets and
[30:56] &gt;&gt; Amen. just at our disposal and and they
[30:59] think how could it advance any farther?
[31:01] But it will
[31:02] &gt;&gt; another 20 years, you know, if things
[31:05] are ravel because we're constantly
[31:06] learning. But thank God, God's not that
[31:10] way.
[31:11] &gt;&gt; He's all knowing. He's all powerful. He
[31:14] knows every flea. He knows every sands
[31:17] on the seashore. He knows all the stars
[31:19] that's in the heavens. Amen. And he
[31:23] rewrapped the gift and he sent it back
[31:25] to you and I. Amen. That we can be
[31:27] victorious in the age that we're living
[31:30] in.
[31:32] &gt;&gt; Yet, we're trapped in humanity.
[31:35] &gt;&gt; Amen. We We make mistakes. We fall
[31:38] short. And we're humans.
[31:41] I was visiting with some friends the
[31:43] other day and we got to talking about
[31:44] some of these things and and how that
[31:47] you know that that we live in such a a
[31:50] great hour and there's such a
[31:51] revelation. There's such a there's such
[31:54] a great vast of the Holy Spirit that's
[31:57] moving. Amen. There's such praise and
[31:59] there's such worship. There's a shout in
[32:01] the camp. Amen. Because of God's words
[32:04] unfolding at such a rapid pace.
[32:07] &gt;&gt; It's getting to the bride. There's never
[32:09] been a day like this day. This is the
[32:12] age of transa translation. This is the
[32:14] age of a rapture. This is the age of a
[32:16] body change. And I believe there's a ray
[32:19] of resources for that certain purpose.
[32:22] Amen. It's not way out there. He said
[32:24] everything that you have need of. Even
[32:26] the of this body change, the rapture is
[32:29] already within you. You you're not
[32:31] waiting on something great to come,
[32:33] church. I'm telling you within you is
[32:36] everything you have need of. Sister
[32:38] Tammy, he said, "Just keep drinking."
[32:40] Amen. More you drink out, the more it'll
[32:42] push out. Amen. All of a sudden, brother
[32:44] and sister, we're going to be traveling
[32:46] along. We're going to step right out of
[32:48] this division. And there's nothing hell
[32:50] can do about it. There's nothing
[32:52] churches can do about there's nothing
[32:53] flesh can do about it.
[32:56] &gt;&gt; Cuz when that appointed time comes,
[32:59] there's going to be a array of resources
[33:02] for that certain purpose. Can you say
[33:04] &gt;&gt; amen? Amen.
[33:06] &gt;&gt; But as long as we're trapped in this
[33:07] human body of m of this mortality,
[33:12] humanity,
[33:13] &gt;&gt; we lean, we lean to what we can see. And
[33:17] &gt;&gt; and we lean to what we could hear. And
[33:20] &gt;&gt; but the whole senses, brother Andrew,
[33:21] has limitations. It can only go so far.
[33:25] &gt;&gt; It can only take you so far. It can only
[33:27] reveal so far.
[33:29] &gt;&gt; It has an end. And same way with
[33:31] imagination, conscience, memory,
[33:34] affection, all those things are good.
[33:36] Amen. But they can only take you so far.
[33:39] &gt;&gt; It has limits. Brother would tell us
[33:42] that it's the unlimited resources of God
[33:45] has never been tapped yet. There's
[33:48] blessings and powers that we know
[33:50] nothing about
[33:52] &gt;&gt; and never been ever revealed even to
[33:54] archangels. is laying just ahead for his
[33:58] church that will believe.
[34:01] &gt;&gt; For eyes has not seen and ears has not
[34:04] heard, neither has it entered in the
[34:06] hearts of man what God has for them in
[34:09] store for them that love him.
[34:12] &gt;&gt; So let's move up and claim our rights.
[34:15] &gt;&gt; God opens the gates and swings out the
[34:18] welcome mat.
[34:19] &gt;&gt; There is an array of resources, untapped
[34:22] resources. We just step over into a tree
[34:25] of faith.
[34:27] &gt;&gt; Amen. Where all things are possible with
[34:29] them that believe.
[34:30] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[34:31] &gt;&gt; It's the power of God that's going to
[34:33] change these vile bodies.
[34:36] &gt;&gt; Let's water it tonight
[34:38] &gt;&gt; with our praise and worship.
[34:41] &gt;&gt; There's no way to stop the living word
[34:43] of God.
[34:45] &gt;&gt; For she's the final voice to the final
[34:47] age
[34:48] &gt;&gt; underneath her messenger. Death can't
[34:50] stop it. Hell can't stop it. Amen.
[34:52] &gt;&gt; The word of God is powerful.
[34:56] &gt;&gt; And a believer walking on the tree of
[34:59] faith, nothing can stop them.
[35:03] &gt;&gt; The tree of knowledge, the tree of
[35:05] senses can tear you so far. Brother Joe,
[35:09] &gt;&gt; but once it reaches the end, we step
[35:12] right off of that onto the tree of
[35:15] faith. He says,
[35:18] &gt;&gt; "And that tree
[35:20] &gt;&gt; is a ray of resources
[35:22] &gt;&gt; where all things are possible
[35:25] &gt;&gt; to them that believe."
[35:28] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[35:30] &gt;&gt; You believe it.
[35:31] &gt;&gt; Job 3:9 says, "Proclaim ye this among
[35:34] the Gentiles. Prepare for war. Wake up
[35:37] the mighty men. Let all the men of war
[35:39] draw near. Let them come up and beat
[35:42] your plowshares into swords and your
[35:44] pruning hooks into spears. And let the
[35:47] weak say, "I am strong."
[35:50] &gt;&gt; See, it wasn't not it wasn't the plow
[35:53] shares. It wasn't the pruning hooks. No,
[35:57] sir. It's a believer in contact with his
[36:01] maker.
[36:03] &gt;&gt; A rock can destroy a giant.
[36:06] &gt;&gt; An Oscar can defeat 600.
[36:09] A jawbone can defeat a thousand
[36:11] Philistines.
[36:14] &gt;&gt; It's the force that's behind that
[36:17] &gt;&gt; that makes the difference.
[36:20] &gt;&gt; It's a badge of authority.
[36:23] &gt;&gt; Amen. The cop, he has a past.
[36:27] &gt;&gt; He He He has scars.
[36:30] &gt;&gt; He's been through griefs and sorrows.
[36:34] &gt;&gt; He may be lame.
[36:36] &gt;&gt; He may be crippled.
[36:39] Brother Brian, but if he's wearing the
[36:42] badge, amen, of authority, and upon that
[36:46] badge is a seal, and behind that seal,
[36:49] amen, there's authority, and behind that
[36:52] authority, there is power.
[36:55] It doesn't matter what kind of vile body
[36:57] that police officer is standing in. But
[37:00] if he's wearing the badge of authority,
[37:04] everything in that county, in that
[37:06] country is behind that man.
[37:11] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[37:14] &gt;&gt; He has array of resources behind him.
[37:19] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[37:22] He said that poor fella couldn't stop
[37:24] anything.
[37:27] &gt;&gt; He said he couldn't, brother. He said he
[37:29] couldn't even stop a runaway pony
[37:32] from his strength. Certainly not. But he
[37:36] walked out in the street, the big bad
[37:38] shining, blowed that whistle and held up
[37:41] his hand, brother. 300 lb horsepower,
[37:43] squeaked brakes and everything else. It
[37:46] wasn't the power of the man. It was an
[37:49] authority that he had.
[37:52] &gt;&gt; He said, "That's the church. It might be
[37:54] a bunch of holy rollers.
[37:56] &gt;&gt; It might be a bunch of rednecks,
[37:58] hillbillies from Arkansas. Paladen,
[38:01] Black Rockck, Warner Ridge, Pocahontas.
[38:04] Amen. Is gathering in a barn. That was a
[38:06] nice sanctuary." Amen. Praising God.
[38:09] Amen. It might not look like a bunch to
[38:11] the world, but Soar, whatever you want
[38:13] to call it, he says, "But it's the
[38:16] authority that's behind her." That's
[38:20] what does it regardless of conditions.
[38:23] Didn't matter how lame he was. Didn't
[38:25] matter how crippled he was. Didn't
[38:27] matter if he's black, rod, red. Didn't
[38:29] matter how fat, how little he was.
[38:31] Didn't matter how rich or poor he was.
[38:34] What was behind him was the power of
[38:37] that country. I say church of a living
[38:39] God, a bunch of hillbillies from
[38:41] Arkansas, what's behind you is not just
[38:45] the power of this country, but the power
[38:47] of almighty God. Amen. And you are the
[38:50] manifestation of the voice of Malachi 4.
[38:56] &gt;&gt; I say you are an invisible army.
[39:00] [Music]
[39:03] &gt;&gt; Oh, we can see our bad days. We can see
[39:06] the the shortcomings. We can see our
[39:08] failures. We can see our mistakes.
[39:12] &gt;&gt; But beyond that, church,
[39:15] &gt;&gt; my
[39:16] if I had a subtitle tonight, brother
[39:19] Brian, I'd like to take victory with the
[39:21] limp.
[39:23] &gt;&gt; Amen. Listen. He says, "Regardless
[39:27] of conditions,
[39:29] God's law works with his word. It won't
[39:32] work with a creed. It'll work with the
[39:35] word. It just works with the word
[39:38] regardless of conditions. He says, "The
[39:41] greatest experiences I ever had to come
[39:44] up against something I couldn't get over
[39:45] it. I couldn't get under it. I just
[39:48] stood there and watched God make a way
[39:50] through it."
[39:51] &gt;&gt; That's the way to do it. Just move and
[39:54] keep moving on, brother Mark.
[39:58] &gt;&gt; And he says, "Just keep moving. Press
[40:00] your nose against it.
[40:02] Just keep moving. Just keep going on.
[40:05] God will make a way.
[40:08] &gt;&gt; Before you get there, there's a
[40:10] predestinated
[40:12] resources. Amen. For this bride's
[40:15] arsenal, amen, is very equipped.
[40:20] &gt;&gt; What kind of God would we have tonight
[40:23] if he just gave you a halfway message,
[40:25] &gt;&gt; a halfway religion, a halfway power?
[40:29] &gt;&gt; Oh, no. He said even archangels know
[40:32] nothing about but you church. You that
[40:35] can believe. All things are possible to
[40:38] you that believe. Mountains can be
[40:40] disintegrated.
[40:43] &gt;&gt; Feelings can be broken. Depression can
[40:45] be struck down.
[40:47] &gt;&gt; Amen. Oppression can be omitted.
[40:50] &gt;&gt; Amen. It's not a fairy tale. Amen. I say
[40:53] I say tonight we can hear it every
[40:55] church service. But it's still the
[40:57] gospel truth. All things are possible to
[41:01] them that believe.
[41:03] [Applause]
[41:05] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[41:06] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[41:09] &gt;&gt; 2 Corinthians tells us, "Last I should
[41:12] be exalted above measure through the
[41:14] abundance of revelation that was given
[41:16] me a thorn in the flesh, the messenger
[41:19] of Satan to buffer me, lest I should be
[41:22] exalted above measure."
[41:24] Brother Andrew,
[41:26] &gt;&gt; for the this thing I receive the Lord
[41:28] thrice that I might depart from me. And
[41:31] he said unto me, my grace is sufficient
[41:35] for thee.
[41:37] &gt;&gt; For my strength is made perfect in
[41:40] weakness.
[41:41] &gt;&gt; For when I'm weak, I am strong. The word
[41:45] strong there means able or powerful or
[41:48] means excelling in something. It means
[41:50] to be a mighty man. It means to meet the
[41:53] challenge
[41:55] &gt;&gt; for God who commanded the light to shine
[41:59] out of darkness has shined in our hearts
[42:02] &gt;&gt; to give the light of the knowledge of
[42:04] the glory of God in the face of Jesus
[42:06] Christ. But we have treasure in earthly
[42:09] vessels for the excellence of the power
[42:11] may be of God.
[42:14] &gt;&gt; It may be of God, brother Jared, and not
[42:16] of us.
[42:18] &gt;&gt; I hope you catch that tonight. We are
[42:20] troubled on every side yet not
[42:23] distressed.
[42:26] &gt;&gt; Come on. In other words, he's telling
[42:28] we're trapped in human flesh. We're
[42:30] trapped in humanity.
[42:31] &gt;&gt; We got We got trouble on every side.
[42:34] You're not yet you're not distressed. We
[42:36] are perplexed but na not in this
[42:38] despair. We're persecuted but not
[42:41] forsaken. We are cast down but not
[42:44] destroyed. Amen. thousand can fall at
[42:47] this side, 10,000 at this side, but
[42:50] cannot come nigh unto thee.
[42:53] &gt;&gt; Treasure in earthly vessels.
[42:56] &gt;&gt; Amen. What an absolute.
[42:58] &gt;&gt; It's perfect within itself. It's
[43:00] unlimited in power. It's the ultimate.
[43:04] It's the Amen. It's the final voice.
[43:08] &gt;&gt; It's the anchor of the soul. Amen. When
[43:11] this is ready to quit,
[43:15] &gt;&gt; Romans 8 tells us we walk not after the
[43:17] flesh
[43:18] &gt;&gt; but after the spirit. And brother Brown
[43:21] would make a statement like this. My
[43:23] flesh says don't do this. Or my flesh
[43:26] says I'm too tired.
[43:28] &gt;&gt; He said, but my spirit, brother Tim,
[43:30] says you're not.
[43:32] &gt;&gt; Your flesh may be tired,
[43:34] &gt;&gt; but you're not too tired.
[43:36] &gt;&gt; Amen. You're predestinated for such a
[43:39] time as this.
[43:41] &gt;&gt; Amen. And he said, you're not tired. And
[43:44] he said, I'm the boss.
[43:46] &gt;&gt; Follow me.
[43:48] &gt;&gt; Follow me to victory. Follow me to
[43:51] deliverance.
[43:53] And then he goes on, brother say, I seen
[43:54] a ship one time when it was tossed out
[43:57] there and I thought, what's holding that
[43:58] ship and that same spot? I couldn't
[44:01] understand it sitting out there in the
[44:04] sea. He says, "And I noticed the waves
[44:06] have carried it around this way and back
[44:08] around this way, but it didn't move from
[44:10] that position or place rather. I could
[44:13] not see nothing. It was unseen
[44:18] in a time of trouble." He said, "But
[44:21] there was a little wire rope there that
[44:24] run down to the bow of the ship unto an
[44:27] anchor that had caught something
[44:29] beneath." Oh, he says my where I could
[44:32] not see beyond the water, it was holding
[44:35] there. Amen. That ship might have looked
[44:37] battered. That ship might have looked
[44:39] broken. Amen. But there was an unseen
[44:42] resources. Amen. Declare. It was
[44:45] declaring victory. Before the waves,
[44:48] there was already an anchor.
[44:50] &gt;&gt; Before the storm ever raised up, there
[44:53] was already an anchor.
[44:57] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[44:58] Before
[45:00] They came against Bailac and Balam ever
[45:03] came against the children of God. There
[45:06] was already atonement, brother Bam said
[45:08] was in effect. It was already in effect
[45:10] for the children of God. Amen. They
[45:13] didn't realize it. He said there was a
[45:15] shout of a king that was among them.
[45:18] &gt;&gt; Amen. When they was trying to condemn
[45:20] them and curse them, God said, "I can't
[45:22] curse what I've already blessed."
[45:26] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[45:28] He said, he said it was holding him. He
[45:30] said, "Praise be to God. It isn't the
[45:33] ship doing the holding. It's the anchor
[45:35] doing the holding. It isn't what I am or
[45:38] what I will be or what I was. It's what
[45:42] he is now."
[45:47] &gt;&gt; It's what he is now.
[45:50] &gt;&gt; James tells us, "Be you also patient and
[45:53] establish your hearts.
[45:56] strengthen, make strong
[45:59] &gt;&gt; or to make stable.
[46:01] &gt;&gt; And brother Ram would say, give them
[46:03] this undergirling power.
[46:05] Undergurt is fortify. I dealt with this
[46:08] a few months back. Fortify or strengthen
[46:11] or brace you up. It's a power of the
[46:14] faith of knowing that thy never failing
[46:16] presence will be with us. Then the hour
[46:19] we cannot help ourselves.
[46:22] &gt;&gt; Amen. We know the angels are encamped
[46:24] around them
[46:26] &gt;&gt; who fear him. Though I walk in the midst
[46:29] of trouble, thou will revive me.
[46:31] &gt;&gt; I got something, brother. I got
[46:33] something on the inside of me. It's
[46:36] taking me on and on and on and on.
[46:41] &gt;&gt; The Lord thy God is with thee
[46:43] wheresoever thou goest. No matter what
[46:46] it is, how hard it is, how great the
[46:48] obstacle is, it doesn't matter. If it's
[46:52] down through the valley of the shadow of
[46:54] death, the Lord thy God is with thee. It
[46:57] may seem like you're sinking.
[47:00] &gt;&gt; Hope you're catching. I I I'm going to
[47:02] hopefully get somewhere tonight.
[47:04] &gt;&gt; Amen. It may look like that ship is
[47:07] broken.
[47:08] &gt;&gt; It may look like, brother Benji, that
[47:11] that is is it may be sinking.
[47:14] &gt;&gt; It may be failing.
[47:16] &gt;&gt; It may be coming up short.
[47:18] &gt;&gt; It may be tossed about over here. and
[47:21] talks about over here in the wind as
[47:23] tormenting that vessel to no end.
[47:27] &gt;&gt; But in the unseen world
[47:29] &gt;&gt; down below the water
[47:32] &gt;&gt; there was an anchor sure and steadfast.
[47:35] &gt;&gt; Amen. It goes against our nature but
[47:38] it's a fornowledge of God taking place.
[47:40] Amen.
[47:42] &gt;&gt; Oh hallelujah.
[47:44] &gt;&gt; We can't lose tonight church.
[47:47] &gt;&gt; Amen. We say it a lot. We can't die no
[47:49] more than God can die. We can't be
[47:51] destroyed. You say, "Brother Joe, why
[47:53] they put us in the ground somewhere?"
[47:55] Amen. That has not brother Morgan has
[47:57] nothing to do with it. Amen. It's just a
[47:59] holding place. Death is only a tool in
[48:02] the hand of the maker. And death doesn't
[48:05] have control over a believer. Hell
[48:07] doesn't have a control over a believer.
[48:10] &gt;&gt; And though you take your last breath on
[48:12] this earth, I've got loved ones. I
[48:14] buried my two kids. I I buried my uncle.
[48:17] I buried my grandfather. Amen. But
[48:19] there's coming a day, church. Amen. And
[48:22] I've got assurance tonight. Amen. That
[48:24] grave ain't going to hold that body
[48:26] down. And I know in a moment, in a
[48:29] twinkling of an eye, I'm going to be
[48:31] changed to catch up.
[48:35] &gt;&gt; Meet them in the air. It's not a fairy
[48:38] tale. It's a reality. Amen. It's array
[48:41] of resources
[48:43] &gt;&gt; that we can't help it. We can't defeat
[48:45] death. But he has.
[48:48] &gt;&gt; We can't defeat hell, but he has.
[48:54] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[48:59] &gt;&gt; That little old ship that night, he says
[49:02] all hopes were gone and she was toss
[49:04] about. Looked like the eye last hour was
[49:07] there. But all at once, someone came
[49:09] walking on the water. Just as calm. He's
[49:12] always there. He's never late. One more
[49:15] dash and the ship would have went down,
[49:17] but he's always there.
[49:22] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. He came walking. I know I
[49:25] did preached this here before,
[49:27] &gt;&gt; but he came walking, brother Angel, on
[49:29] the very thing that was trying to
[49:31] destroy them.
[49:33] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. He was making us a He was
[49:35] making a statement to the disciples.
[49:38] Amen. This storm is under your feet.
[49:41] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. And God and the message of
[49:44] the hour has told us and screamed,
[49:47] "Amen, it is over. The battle's over.
[49:50] The victory has been won."
[49:53] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Everything is under your
[49:56] feet.
[49:59] &gt;&gt; And I understand, let's rewind for a
[50:02] second. I understand we get trapped in
[50:05] our feelings sometimes.
[50:09] As brother Matt or brother one of the
[50:11] brothers was mentioning here the other
[50:13] day about brother Brown tell him you
[50:15] know tell him tell him I'm not here. We
[50:17] get trapped in our flesh sometimes. We
[50:20] get trapped in our feelings.
[50:22] &gt;&gt; Sometimes we say things that we don't
[50:24] really mean.
[50:27] &gt;&gt; From the pastor to the preachers to the
[50:29] back door. We all human.
[50:32] &gt;&gt; And I believe brother Brown spent time
[50:34] and not just time but words on tape to
[50:37] let us know. Amen. Amen. How human we
[50:40] can be sometimes. But how powerful we
[50:43] still are.
[50:44] &gt;&gt; Greater is he that is in us than the he
[50:47] that's in the world.
[50:48] &gt;&gt; This flesh may get down. It may get weak
[50:50] in the spirit. Our spirit may be
[50:52] wounded, but down inside a believer is
[50:56] the power that generates his
[50:57] resurrection. The Holy Spirit is in you.
[51:00] Now, brother Brand would say, God said
[51:02] to Paul,
[51:04] "My strength is perfect in your
[51:06] weakness. My strength becomes more
[51:09] perfect as you become more weaker. More
[51:12] you can yield to me, the better I can
[51:14] use you.
[51:15] &gt;&gt; And remember, brother Brown said, "The
[51:17] secret to power is humility.
[51:19] &gt;&gt; The way up is down."
[51:22] &gt;&gt; Amen. Hey, you be exalted, you'll be
[51:24] abased.
[51:26] &gt;&gt; But bring yourself here and God will
[51:28] bring you up here.
[51:32] &gt;&gt; Is that the message?
[51:33] &gt;&gt; Amen. And he says, "The more you can
[51:35] yield to me, the better I can use you.
[51:37] The more you can forget about your
[51:39] education, the more you can forget about
[51:41] the denominations. The more you can
[51:43] forget about your stuff
[51:45] &gt;&gt; and yield yourself to me, the more I can
[51:48] use you because you become weak.
[51:51] &gt;&gt; My I'll make my own purpose strong."
[51:54] &gt;&gt; Think about that for a moment. Amen. We
[51:56] can get so beside oursel and letting go
[51:59] of our feelings, letting go of our
[52:01] ideas, forgetting about our feelings,
[52:04] letting go of our past
[52:06] &gt;&gt; and get to a place where God can make
[52:09] his purpose real in our lives. Amen. How
[52:13] many would like that tonight?
[52:15] &gt;&gt; I can make my own purpose strong through
[52:18] your weakness. Come on.
[52:20] &gt;&gt; And Paul would say he's a a thorn in the
[52:24] flesh, a messenger of the devil to
[52:26] buffet me.
[52:27] &gt;&gt; And buffet means, I know you know these
[52:29] things. Let's rehearse it one more time
[52:30] tonight.
[52:32] &gt;&gt; Buffet means blow after blow, wave after
[52:36] wave.
[52:37] &gt;&gt; You get knocked down, you get back up.
[52:39] You get knocked down, you get back up.
[52:42] You get pushed down, you get back up.
[52:44] Wave after wave. And look at Paul. And
[52:47] Paul's
[52:50] He's he's he's talking to his father and
[52:54] he's telling a buffet of blow after
[52:56] blow, wave after wave.
[53:00] It would get better and here it come
[53:02] again. He said, "Lord, what's the
[53:05] matter?
[53:07] You don't take this away from me." He
[53:10] said, "Paul, my grace is sufficient."
[53:15] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[53:16] Paul just keep on moving his head to the
[53:22] Lord. Lord, why don't you take this from
[53:24] me?
[53:26] I'm here in I get down. I have a good
[53:28] day, then I have a bad day. I have a
[53:30] good day and I have a great moment. I
[53:32] have a bad moment.
[53:35] &gt;&gt; Lord, I've asked this twice.
[53:39] Can you please take this from me? Paul,
[53:42] my grace is enough. Amen.
[53:46] &gt;&gt; My grace
[53:47] &gt;&gt; is sufficient.
[53:51] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[53:55] &gt;&gt; And Jacob wrestled with the Lord.
[54:00] Wrestled with the angel of the Lord.
[54:05] When the night was getting long,
[54:08] Brother Brad would dramatize it out.
[54:11] He said, "I ain't going to let you go.
[54:15] until you bless me.
[54:19] &gt;&gt; And he wrestled. Brother R would say he
[54:21] had a wrestling party with the angel of
[54:24] the Lord. He wrestled with him, brother
[54:27] Andrew, all night long.
[54:32] &gt;&gt; But that night, he came there as a
[54:35] deceiver
[54:36] &gt;&gt; and a coward.
[54:38] &gt;&gt; But he came in contact with a greater
[54:41] power
[54:42] &gt;&gt; than that of Jacob.
[54:43] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[54:47] He had a determination
[54:50] &gt;&gt; that I'm going to hold on
[54:53] &gt;&gt; until I receive my blessing.
[54:56] &gt;&gt; Oh, don't you feel that way tonight,
[54:58] church?
[54:59] &gt;&gt; Amen. The very power that's going to get
[55:02] us out of here. Amen. I want to water it
[55:05] tonight. I want to water it with my
[55:07] praise. I want to water it with my
[55:09] worship.
[55:11] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[55:15] It was then that Jacob become a prince
[55:18] of God
[55:20] and his name was changed. He said you
[55:23] remember he was a great strong man on
[55:25] this side intellectual power but on the
[55:29] other side he was Olympic prince.
[55:33] &gt;&gt; Listen to this brother Ben. He said he
[55:35] was weak and wore down but had the power
[55:39] of God before him.
[55:40] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[55:41] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. this great big strong w
[55:45] he said this great big strong he was
[55:48] Jacob on this side of the river a great
[55:51] big strong healthy coward and on the
[55:53] other side of the river he was a limping
[55:56] Israel
[55:57] &gt;&gt; on this side of the river he was a
[55:59] strong man Jacob but on a deceiver on
[56:03] this other side of the river he was a
[56:05] limping warrior
[56:07] &gt;&gt; not afraid of nothing
[56:09] &gt;&gt; he said what the church needs to do is
[56:11] to do Like Jacob, pray till you get a
[56:14] vday.
[56:15] &gt;&gt; Jacob had a wrestling party all night
[56:18] long with the Lord. I'm just not going
[56:21] to let you go until I get the victory.
[56:26] &gt;&gt; And then about daylight one morning, he
[56:28] had a Vday. He didn't walk the same
[56:31] anymore.
[56:33] &gt;&gt; He was a limping prince.
[56:38] &gt;&gt; That side of the river, Sister Debbie.
[56:41] Amen. He was a big strong coward.
[56:45] &gt;&gt; He walked the walk. He looked stronger.
[56:48] He looked more powerful on this side.
[56:51] Amen. When he wrestled with the Lord,
[56:53] the angel of the Lord reached down into
[56:56] the hollow place of his hip.
[56:58] &gt;&gt; And from that moment, it changed him.
[57:02] &gt;&gt; His walk changed.
[57:04] &gt;&gt; His attitude changed. Come on.
[57:07] &gt;&gt; And church, he left there with victory.
[57:12] &gt;&gt; Listen. He says
[57:15] &gt;&gt; by daylight, he said, "But on the other
[57:17] side, he's a limping prince. A limping
[57:20] prince with enough courage to fight the
[57:23] whole army of Esau."
[57:26] And Esau said, "I'll furnish you with an
[57:28] army."
[57:30] I like this response.
[57:32] &gt;&gt; He says,
[57:34] &gt;&gt; "I don't need it.
[57:37] Same way David said, "I don't need your
[57:38] armor," Saul.
[57:41] &gt;&gt; Amen. I don't need it.
[57:43] &gt;&gt; I I might have took it yesterday, but I
[57:46] came in contact with my maker.
[57:49] &gt;&gt; And the most powerful weapon is a
[57:52] believer in contact with his maker.
[57:56] &gt;&gt; It changed him.
[57:57] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[57:58] &gt;&gt; I believe it changed him in a way. He
[58:01] came out of that valley that day,
[58:02] brother. Amen. limping
[58:05] &gt;&gt; to the world. He might look broken and
[58:06] wore out. He might not look like he can
[58:09] maneuver like he used to.
[58:11] &gt;&gt; Amen. But beyond that, he had array of
[58:14] resources for a certain purpose. He had
[58:17] an arsenal.
[58:21] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. He was a limping prince.
[58:25] &gt;&gt; But he had victory.
[58:27] &gt;&gt; Every time he would get in the battle,
[58:29] Amen. I believe, brother Andrew, he
[58:30] might have held on to that limb. He
[58:32] could look down and say, "This is not my
[58:33] battle.
[58:34] &gt;&gt; This is not my battle." Amen. The limp
[58:37] kept the servant humble.
[58:40] &gt;&gt; Every time he say, "Brother Brian," and
[58:42] when he got to a point, man, I I can do
[58:44] this. He would get up in the morning,
[58:46] begin to walk.
[58:47] &gt;&gt; And he begin to realize, "I can't even
[58:49] walk without him holding my hand. I'm
[58:51] nothing without my God. He's the one
[58:53] that fights my battles. He's the one
[58:56] that fights my enemy. I'm nothing
[58:58] without him." The secret to power is
[59:02] humility.
[59:03] &gt;&gt; Amen. He had the victory with a limp.
[59:08] &gt;&gt; Oh, glory. He was a limping prince with
[59:11] array of resources. Untapped resources.
[59:14] I don't need your army.
[59:17] &gt;&gt; I don't need your strength.
[59:19] Paul, my grace is sufficient. It's not
[59:23] diluted down.
[59:27] How many growing up around the messes,
[59:29] grown out in denomination, sister, we
[59:32] just got tired of such a diluted
[59:34] message,
[59:35] &gt;&gt; a diluted so-called message, a diluted
[59:38] service,
[59:39] &gt;&gt; a diluted word,
[59:41] &gt;&gt; men's idea entached with the word.
[59:46] &gt;&gt; It deluded.
[59:48] &gt;&gt; Amen. It concentrated.
[59:51] It's 100% truth.
[59:53] Hallelujah. It ain't 1% nothing else.
[59:56] It's 100%.
[59:59] &gt;&gt; We don't need it diluted.
[1:00:04] &gt;&gt; It's 100% life.
[1:00:07] &gt;&gt; He said, "I'll never fail you.
[1:00:09] &gt;&gt; I'll never forsake you. I'll be with
[1:00:11] you, even in you, to the end of the
[1:00:13] world."
[1:00:16] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Oh, brother. The angel of
[1:00:19] the Lord changed his walk to a limp.
[1:00:25] Oh, brother. From that moment, he knew
[1:00:28] it wasn't him.
[1:00:30] &gt;&gt; It's the God that changed his walk.
[1:00:33] &gt;&gt; Greater power than that of Jacob. Now,
[1:00:36] through God's transforming power. I am
[1:00:40] what I am by the grace of God.
[1:00:43] &gt;&gt; God lets a messenger of the devil to
[1:00:45] keep me beat down. He said, "Then when
[1:00:47] I'm weak,
[1:00:50] &gt;&gt; come on, somebody.
[1:00:52] There ain't nothing happen to God's
[1:00:54] saints without God, our great shepherd,
[1:00:56] knowing about it.
[1:00:58] &gt;&gt; Hey, let let it ring loud tonight. I
[1:01:00] ain't going to hold you long tonight.
[1:01:02] All things work to the good. That's not
[1:01:04] a fairy tale. That's a reality tonight.
[1:01:07] Nothing happens to you by coincidence.
[1:01:10] It's only making you stronger. Brother
[1:01:12] said it's a shaking you. Amen. What does
[1:01:14] a shaking do? Amen. It gets your roots
[1:01:16] are growing and digging down deeper.
[1:01:19] Amen. Makes you stronger. Oh, the leaves
[1:01:21] may be blowing. The limbs may be
[1:01:24] crackling a little bit. It might look
[1:01:25] dark and gloomy on the outside, but
[1:01:28] underneath there's an anchor of the soul
[1:01:30] that is sure and steadfast.
[1:01:33] &gt;&gt; We may be limping. Amen. Brother Donnie
[1:01:36] Reagan preached a message one time, too
[1:01:38] tired to get up. Amen. We battered and
[1:01:41] beat. Leo waves is constantly bashing at
[1:01:44] us.
[1:01:45] &gt;&gt; But here we are. Look around. A bunch of
[1:01:48] limping pre princes here tonight with
[1:01:50] the authority of a king.
[1:01:55] &gt;&gt; Amen. A prince has the badge of
[1:01:58] authority.
[1:02:00] &gt;&gt; Amen. We may be limpid in the hour that
[1:02:02] we're living because the flesh is going
[1:02:03] back to the elements which it came from.
[1:02:07] &gt;&gt; Brother said we're stoop shoulders. A
[1:02:09] older you get, the more you're going
[1:02:11] back to the dust where you came from.
[1:02:17] I tell you, this time next year, I'll be
[1:02:18] 50 years old.
[1:02:21] &gt;&gt; Wow.
[1:02:23] &gt;&gt; I used to think that was old, man. But
[1:02:25] but but Danny ain't near as old as he
[1:02:27] used to be.
[1:02:32] &gt;&gt; But I can feel it. And if you're 60, 70,
[1:02:36] 80 years old tonight, you can feel it.
[1:02:39] &gt;&gt; Amen. It's just a We're a few days and
[1:02:42] full of trouble. We're going back to the
[1:02:44] dust where we come from.
[1:02:47] &gt;&gt; But there ain't no grave going to hold
[1:02:49] this body down.
[1:02:50] &gt;&gt; Amen. I'm telling you, church, it's not
[1:02:52] a real It's not a fairy tale. It's a
[1:02:55] reality.
[1:02:58] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:02:59] &gt;&gt; Oh, I am what I am by the grace of God.
[1:03:02] Let's close with this tonight. God let
[1:03:04] the messenger of devil to keep me beat
[1:03:06] down. He said, then when I'm weak, I am
[1:03:10] strong.
[1:03:11] &gt;&gt; Amen. growing pains of grace.
[1:03:15] &gt;&gt; Growing pains of his grace.
[1:03:18] He may permit crossroads. Yes, sir.
[1:03:23] &gt;&gt; He may permit crossroads to try us to
[1:03:26] perfect us for his service. He may
[1:03:30] permit permit that now church both here
[1:03:33] and on the tape. He may per permit the
[1:03:35] crossroads for our service.
[1:03:37] &gt;&gt; All right.
[1:03:38] &gt;&gt; Like he did Daniel. He gave Daniel a
[1:03:41] little crossroad one day. You know, he
[1:03:43] was a great man down in Babylon. He let
[1:03:45] the king turn against him and throw him
[1:03:47] in a lion's did it only perfected him.
[1:03:50] &gt;&gt; Sure it did. He said the Hebrew children
[1:03:52] went to the fiery furnace. They was
[1:03:54] determined to stand for his word. The
[1:03:56] only thing that crossroad did to the
[1:03:58] Hebrew children. Amen. It stood on the
[1:04:00] word. It only loosed them from the bands
[1:04:03] that held around their feet and legs. It
[1:04:05] only gave them the ability to praise
[1:04:08] their king. Aren't you thankful for
[1:04:10] that, church? He said there was just
[1:04:12] enough fire. There was just enough heat
[1:04:14] to burn the latches off their hands and
[1:04:16] feet. Amen. So we can give God some
[1:04:18] praise.
[1:04:20] &gt;&gt; Say, "Brother Joe, do you always praise
[1:04:21] him like I should?" I don't,
[1:04:24] &gt;&gt; but I want to.
[1:04:26] &gt;&gt; Come on, somebody. Amen. We all get to
[1:04:29] the place like that. But what's a good
[1:04:31] thing? We get back up. We may get
[1:04:34] knocked down, but we can look at Satan
[1:04:35] said, "I'm still coming."
[1:04:37] &gt;&gt; Amen. And I might not look like I
[1:04:38] should. I might not be as strong in this
[1:04:40] flesh body like I ought to. Amen. But
[1:04:43] down inside of this body, down through
[1:04:46] the soul of a man is eternal life that
[1:04:49] had aos of life that never had a
[1:04:52] beginning and never will have an end.
[1:04:56] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. And when we go through our
[1:04:58] crossroads, it's only making us
[1:05:01] stronger. It's making us get deeper
[1:05:03] roots.
[1:05:06] I am
[1:05:07] &gt;&gt; what I am by the grace of God.
[1:05:10] &gt;&gt; Can you say it with me tonight? I am
[1:05:13] what I am by the grace of God.
[1:05:16] &gt;&gt; Say, God, why hadn't you took this from
[1:05:19] me?
[1:05:21] &gt;&gt; His response could be tonight, Brother
[1:05:22] Brian, my grace is sufficient for you.
[1:05:30] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:05:36] Maybe God's doing that to break some of
[1:05:38] the worldly bands
[1:05:40] &gt;&gt; that got you bound down.
[1:05:43] &gt;&gt; Come on.
[1:05:44] &gt;&gt; Maybe God's allowing a lot of little
[1:05:46] pressure to come in your life to break
[1:05:49] some worldlinism off of your life.
[1:05:53] &gt;&gt; Come on.
[1:05:54] &gt;&gt; Come on, church. Amen. We need it,
[1:05:56] church. Amen. We're trapped in such a
[1:05:58] world full
[1:06:00] &gt;&gt; of of time seeking sir
[1:06:03] &gt;&gt; seeks our time, seeks our fellowship,
[1:06:06] drains us of our joy, drains us of our
[1:06:08] fellowship, drain us with with our
[1:06:11] family time, drains us from coming to
[1:06:13] church like we should.
[1:06:16] &gt;&gt; Maybe you're going through that pressure
[1:06:19] to knock some of the worldly bands off
[1:06:21] of you
[1:06:22] &gt;&gt; so you can praise him like you once did.
[1:06:26] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Hallelujah. I tell you,
[1:06:28] don't you love the Lord tonight?
[1:06:31] &gt;&gt; I might be limping in the age that we're
[1:06:34] living in. Amen. I might be 50 years
[1:06:36] old, but down inside of this Caleb
[1:06:39] &gt;&gt; is another spirit.
[1:06:41] &gt;&gt; Amen. Down inside of this tabernacle is
[1:06:44] made out of stuff that just can't be
[1:06:46] bluffed.
[1:06:49] who the sun is made free,
[1:06:54] &gt;&gt; sealed
[1:06:56] &gt;&gt; no matter how dark it gets,
[1:07:00] &gt;&gt; it can't cross the bloodline.
[1:07:03] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:07:04] &gt;&gt; And we can sing that song. I'm free.
[1:07:07] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. I'm free.
[1:07:10] &gt;&gt; No longer bound.
[1:07:13] &gt;&gt; No longer bound.
[1:07:16] Brother Joe, you're still frail. You
[1:07:18] still have issues. I'm no longer bound.
[1:07:23] &gt;&gt; I have victory.
[1:07:24] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:07:25] &gt;&gt; Trapped in humanity.
[1:07:28] &gt;&gt; I'm an overcomer
[1:07:29] &gt;&gt; trapped in humanity.
[1:07:31] &gt;&gt; I'm more than an overcomer trapped in
[1:07:34] humanity.
[1:07:36] &gt;&gt; Oh, but one day this humanity is going
[1:07:39] to catch up where where my soul is
[1:07:41] already at. It's going to be changing
[1:07:44] dimensions as fast as we could see.
[1:07:48] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. You say, "I'm rejoicing
[1:07:50] tonight because I know
[1:07:52] &gt;&gt; I know there's coming a moment in my
[1:07:56] journey.
[1:07:58] I'm going to get up
[1:08:00] &gt;&gt; early in the morning. I'm an early
[1:08:02] riser. I'm going to get up early in the
[1:08:04] morning and I'm going to roll out of bed
[1:08:08] &gt;&gt; and I believe it's going to feel
[1:08:11] different that morning.
[1:08:14] &gt;&gt; I believe there's just going to be
[1:08:15] something more of a longing in my heart.
[1:08:19] &gt;&gt; I took my last step on this earth.
[1:08:23] &gt;&gt; I've read my last scripture. I've read
[1:08:26] listen to my last tape
[1:08:30] &gt;&gt; and all of a sudden there's going to
[1:08:32] come a great move
[1:08:35] &gt;&gt; and we're going to step right into it
[1:08:37] cuz your array of resources had made it
[1:08:40] possible
[1:08:41] &gt;&gt; and we're going to change from the
[1:08:43] ridiculous to the sublime. Not just the
[1:08:46] soul, we're going to be changed these
[1:08:49] vow bodies.
[1:08:51] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. This limp that you're
[1:08:53] carrying is going to be changed.
[1:08:56] &gt;&gt; We got the earnest. We got the down
[1:08:58] payment already.
[1:09:01] &gt;&gt; Brother said, "We've already turned
[1:09:04] heavenly."
[1:09:05] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:09:06] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:09:07] &gt;&gt; Oh, hallelujah. We've already turned.
[1:09:11] We've already got a direction.
[1:09:14] &gt;&gt; We're going home.
[1:09:18] &gt;&gt; How many believes that?
[1:09:23] I can read this last quote to you.
[1:09:25] &gt;&gt; Is that okay?
[1:09:28] &gt;&gt; He said, "But you notice God told Noah
[1:09:31] to pitch the ark. Pitch it inside,
[1:09:34] outside, both sides." He said, "Well,
[1:09:36] then I seen what pitch was made out of.
[1:09:38] It was pine tree, hard tree, cut down,
[1:09:40] evergreen tree, and it was cut down. And
[1:09:43] they had to beat the tree with the
[1:09:44] beating of an iron until they beat their
[1:09:46] eyes right out of it. And they would
[1:09:48] take that and they would boil it till it
[1:09:50] got real hot. And they would take that
[1:09:52] hot sap rise it and pour it upon the
[1:09:56] gopher wood. And that gopher would begin
[1:09:58] open up
[1:10:00] &gt;&gt; and just soak it in. And when it become
[1:10:04] full of the Holy Ghost,
[1:10:08] &gt;&gt; when it got full of the sap,
[1:10:11] &gt;&gt; when it got full of his Holy Spirit,
[1:10:14] &gt;&gt; it settled,
[1:10:16] Sister Eve, and it set up
[1:10:20] &gt;&gt; and it was harder than steel.
[1:10:23] &gt;&gt; Now the word pitch means atone. It stand
[1:10:26] between and the pitch that was in the
[1:10:28] gopher wood in the ark was kept out and
[1:10:30] atone the believer from the wrath. Noah
[1:10:32] could not get into the wrath, the waters
[1:10:34] of judgment. You get he says he could
[1:10:37] not come into judgment because there was
[1:10:39] no atonement. There was atonement
[1:10:40] between him and the judgment. Oh, and I
[1:10:43] that's it. Lord, get a good openhearted
[1:10:47] person and pour in the pitch which was
[1:10:50] the Holy Ghost into the believer. And
[1:10:53] when the Holy Ghost and fire until they
[1:10:56] soak it full, they're not their self
[1:10:58] anymore.
[1:10:59] &gt;&gt; They soaked it up. They received the
[1:11:02] blessing for their day
[1:11:05] &gt;&gt; and it changed their identity.
[1:11:07] &gt;&gt; It changed who they was. It changed
[1:11:10] their walk.
[1:11:12] &gt;&gt; It changed their name.
[1:11:15] &gt;&gt; It made them different.
[1:11:18] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:11:20] &gt;&gt; He said they he said until they're so
[1:11:23] soaked full they're not their self
[1:11:25] anymore.
[1:11:27] &gt;&gt; I just don't want to be myself anymore.
[1:11:29] Then she can blunt the waves,
[1:11:33] &gt;&gt; blow after blow,
[1:11:35] &gt;&gt; buffet after buffet,
[1:11:39] &gt;&gt; temptation after temptation,
[1:11:41] &gt;&gt; bad days after bad days.
[1:11:44] &gt;&gt; He says, "Then she can take the waves
[1:11:48] &gt;&gt; and bump against the logs and knock them
[1:11:50] out of the way and just keep on going."
[1:11:53] How many soldiers we have tonight? Amen.
[1:11:56] Can bump away the logs and bump away the
[1:11:58] feelings, bump away the hardship, bump
[1:12:01] away the funny feelings.
[1:12:04] &gt;&gt; Discord between brothers and sisters
[1:12:06] &gt;&gt; can just bump it out of the way and keep
[1:12:09] going. Well, you know what so and so
[1:12:11] said about you. Just bump the log out of
[1:12:13] the way and just keep going. Just keep
[1:12:15] moving on. Don't believe the lie of the
[1:12:18] devil. I don't care if it's coming from
[1:12:20] whoever. Amen. Just take God at his
[1:12:23] word. Amen. Take that brother or sister
[1:12:27] to the Lord in prayer.
[1:12:31] &gt;&gt; Good brother.
[1:12:32] &gt;&gt; Kick it out of the way.
[1:12:33] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:12:34] &gt;&gt; And keep on going.
[1:12:36] &gt;&gt; The wave it might be. Brother Brown said
[1:12:39] that white cap is 10 times maybe he said
[1:12:41] 100 times bigger than I am. But brother
[1:12:44] Jared said, "I'm going to crest every
[1:12:48] one of them,
[1:12:49] &gt;&gt; every wave, every storm,
[1:12:52] &gt;&gt; every tribulation, every famine, every
[1:12:56] sword, every peril." Amen. Everything
[1:12:59] that's going to come against you,
[1:13:01] &gt;&gt; right?
[1:13:02] &gt;&gt; How many believers we have in the house
[1:13:04] tonight? How many has a victory
[1:13:07] &gt;&gt; inside of humanity tonight?
[1:13:10] &gt;&gt; It's just like fire. Shut up in my
[1:13:14] bones.
[1:13:16] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. You can bump him. You can
[1:13:18] bounce him. You can kick him. You can do
[1:13:21] anything you want to. But he's cased
[1:13:24] over. He's harder than steel. He's
[1:13:27] reached a point of no return.
[1:13:31] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Amen. We have the victory
[1:13:35] trapped in humanity,
[1:13:37] &gt;&gt; but we've got the tools. We got the
[1:13:39] arsenal.
[1:13:48] Get behind me, Satan. In the name of the
[1:13:51] Lord Jesus Christ. Amen. You have the
[1:13:53] voice of victory.
[1:13:56] &gt;&gt; You're wearing the badge and you're
[1:13:58] cased over
[1:13:59] &gt;&gt; harder than steel.
[1:14:01] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:14:03] &gt;&gt; Everything that's behind that badge.
[1:14:06] Behind that badge is a seal. Behind the
[1:14:09] seal, there's authority. And behind that
[1:14:11] authority is a power of almighty God.
[1:14:16] &gt;&gt; All that I am,
[1:14:18] &gt;&gt; you're an heir to.
[1:14:19] &gt;&gt; Everything I am, I give it to you.
[1:14:22] &gt;&gt; You speak the word and I will perform
[1:14:25] it.
[1:14:27] &gt;&gt; This is my covenant that I have given it
[1:14:29] to you. And the prophet God says, how
[1:14:32] many believes what he said?
[1:14:34] &gt;&gt; And it can never
[1:14:38] &gt;&gt; never fail.
[1:14:40] I can fail.
[1:14:43] &gt;&gt; Jacob can fall.
[1:14:45] &gt;&gt; But that Israel, there's just something
[1:14:48] about him.
[1:14:50] &gt;&gt; When Jacob gets down,
[1:14:53] there's an Israel inside.
[1:14:56] &gt;&gt; Every time Jacob gets where he don't
[1:14:57] want to have fellowship, there's an
[1:14:59] Israel inside
[1:15:01] &gt;&gt; and says, "You know what,
[1:15:04] brother Brian may say, we need
[1:15:06] fellowship
[1:15:07] &gt;&gt; more than ever. We need each other.
[1:15:10] &gt;&gt; We need to join our likes of fire
[1:15:12] together and begin to lift one another
[1:15:14] up in our praise, in our worship, and
[1:15:17] with our presence.
[1:15:21] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:15:23] But he's cased over, not diluted down
[1:15:26] with funny feelings, bitterness, or but
[1:15:29] cased over by the Holy Ghost and fire.
[1:15:32] And every time sickness strikes your
[1:15:34] home, every time trials strike your
[1:15:37] home. Every time your neighbors say
[1:15:39] something bad about you, it's only
[1:15:41] shaking you up.
[1:15:45] &gt;&gt; Well, Andrew, how victorious would we be
[1:15:47] when we hear somebody talking about,
[1:15:48] "Well, praise God.
[1:15:50] &gt;&gt; It's just making me stronger."
[1:15:52] &gt;&gt; Well, that's not my opinion. That's what
[1:15:54] the prophet said. Come on.
[1:15:56] &gt;&gt; Every time something neighbor says
[1:15:59] something bad about you, it's only
[1:16:01] shaking you up, loosening you up so you
[1:16:04] can get down and get a better hold on
[1:16:05] eternal rock of God's unmovable word.
[1:16:08] That's how God does it. He sends the
[1:16:11] trials to test to prove to shake you up
[1:16:14] and give you a new hold, a victory with
[1:16:19] a limp.
[1:16:20] &gt;&gt; This flesh may look like it's barely
[1:16:23] getting by.
[1:16:27] How many's been there before?
[1:16:30] &gt;&gt; It may be limping through the age of
[1:16:32] such gloom and doom,
[1:16:35] but she's cased over.
[1:16:37] &gt;&gt; She's made out of stuff that can't be
[1:16:38] bluff. She's a limping prince with a
[1:16:41] heaven, all heaven behind her.
[1:16:46] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Victory.
[1:16:49] &gt;&gt; Victory shall be mine.
[1:16:51] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:16:54] Esau says, "Jacob, do you need my
[1:16:58] armor?" I don't need it.
[1:17:01] Jacob, do you need our the our arsenal?
[1:17:05] &gt;&gt; Oh, I've got untapped resources.
[1:17:08] &gt;&gt; Jacob, you can barely walk. All of
[1:17:11] heaven is behind me.
[1:17:14] &gt;&gt; Silver gone have I none, but such as I
[1:17:17] have, I give it unto thee.
[1:17:20] I tell you church, we might not look
[1:17:22] like a uh too much on the outside. Oh,
[1:17:25] but we can see down on the inside of the
[1:17:28] inside tonight.
[1:17:30] &gt;&gt; We have a bunch of limping princes in
[1:17:32] this tabernacle tonight. Amen. On the
[1:17:35] outside, on the other side, you was a
[1:17:37] coward. You was an alcoholic. You was a
[1:17:40] drug addict.
[1:17:42] &gt;&gt; You was adulterer.
[1:17:44] Oh, but you got a hold of something that
[1:17:48] changed you. Had the ability, Amen. to
[1:17:51] to resurrect that predestinated seed
[1:17:55] that was placed down inside of you.
[1:17:59] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:18:00] &gt;&gt; And it ra there's a resurrection that
[1:18:03] took place.
[1:18:05] &gt;&gt; That side you was a drug addict.
[1:18:08] &gt;&gt; This side you're a limping prince.
[1:18:11] That side you is an alcoholic, but this
[1:18:14] side you're a limping prince.
[1:18:17] &gt;&gt; You'll always have that past.
[1:18:20] &gt;&gt; You'll always carry that memory.
[1:18:23] &gt;&gt; But every time you can look down,
[1:18:28] &gt;&gt; I am
[1:18:30] what I am by the grace
[1:18:34] &gt;&gt; of God.
[1:18:35] &gt;&gt; I can't even make it without him holding
[1:18:38] my head. Amen.
[1:18:41] &gt;&gt; We may carry those things in our life,
[1:18:43] in our bosom, but I believe they're
[1:18:45] there to let you know
[1:18:48] he's greater than your past.
[1:18:50] &gt;&gt; He's greater than your alcoholic
[1:18:53] problem. He was greater than your drug
[1:18:55] addiction. He was greater than your
[1:18:58] past.
[1:19:02] &gt;&gt; What a statement from Paul. Sister if
[1:19:04] you'll come sister Eve
[1:19:08] I am what I am David Paul you are what
[1:19:14] you are not by brother Matt
[1:19:18] &gt;&gt; not by David Paul
[1:19:20] &gt;&gt; but by the grace of God
[1:19:24] &gt;&gt; he wanted him to know that no matter
[1:19:27] where he went he was going to be
[1:19:29] victorious
[1:19:31] &gt;&gt; but he was uncarried the limp
[1:19:34] Hallelujah.
[1:19:36] &gt;&gt; And brother Ram said that Caleb, he
[1:19:39] said, "You know what? I thought I was a
[1:19:41] good guy. A a good guide. I thought I
[1:19:43] could make those long distance shots. I
[1:19:45] thought it was me that made those
[1:19:47] record-breaking shots and killed those
[1:19:48] big game." He said, "But you know what?
[1:19:51] I kept coming around to that same spot.
[1:19:54] I kept coming around to that same spot.
[1:19:56] I was on a death march." He said, 'I
[1:19:59] laid my gut over David Paul,
[1:20:02] took my hat off and said, 'Lord, I ain't
[1:20:06] nothing without you. I can't even make
[1:20:08] those shots without you. Lord, I can't
[1:20:11] even walk without you holding my hand.
[1:20:13] I'm nothing. I can't even get out of
[1:20:15] here, Lord. I thought I was good, God,
[1:20:18] but I'm lost.
[1:20:20] [Music]
[1:20:25] &gt;&gt; Sister Janice, all of a sudden,
[1:20:29] When he said, "Amen." He begin to walk
[1:20:32] with the mark. He said he began to walk
[1:20:33] in the wrong direction. And that never
[1:20:36] failing presence reached over and
[1:20:38] touched the prophet of God on the
[1:20:40] shoulder. And when he turned around, he
[1:20:42] cut a hole out
[1:20:45] all the way to the top of the mountain.
[1:20:47] Hallelujah.
[1:20:49] He's ever present, all knowing, all
[1:20:52] powerful.
[1:20:54] &gt;&gt; And he begin to hear, "I'm ever help."
[1:20:57] in a time of trouble.
[1:21:01] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:21:03] But when brother Brandham came to a
[1:21:05] place where he said, "I ain't nothing."
[1:21:08] Then he was exalted.
[1:21:11] &gt;&gt; He walked right out of that,
[1:21:15] held his hand up high cuz he knew he put
[1:21:17] a lifeline between there, top of that
[1:21:19] mountain, down to that cabin. He said,
[1:21:21] "I every time I would hear his uncertain
[1:21:24] sound, but all of a sudden when he
[1:21:26] grabbed a hold of that lifeline like
[1:21:28] Jacob did, something changed." He knew
[1:21:32] it was real. Nothing could take it away
[1:21:34] from him. He knew
[1:21:37] &gt;&gt; it was something. He knew without a
[1:21:40] shadow of a doubt it was going to carry
[1:21:42] him home.
[1:21:44] &gt;&gt; Oh, Brother Travis, I believe I grabbed
[1:21:46] a hold of a lifeline. I'm dared to let
[1:21:49] it go. The winds may blow, the stars may
[1:21:52] rage, and I'm not lit through this age
[1:21:55] of leosia,
[1:21:58] but I got a hold of something. I got a
[1:22:01] hold of something. If the rapture takes
[1:22:03] place tomorrow, I'm going home. If I go
