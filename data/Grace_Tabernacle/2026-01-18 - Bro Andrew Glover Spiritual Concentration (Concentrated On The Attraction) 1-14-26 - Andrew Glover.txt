And Lord, as we've come to this portion of the service this morning, the songs of Zion have been sung. The atmosphere has been created. Now, Lord, we're inviting you to step down among us this morning in the power of your resurrection. Lord, you see these things that you've laid up on our heart this morning. Lord, I pray that you would come, Lord, and you would step into these thoughts, oh God. And Lord, that you would begin to minister to the needs of your children. Lord, I pray this morning those that are sick would be healed. [music] I pray those that are bound would be delivered, oh God. Lord, I pray those that are empty this morning would be filled with your dynamics, Lord. Father, we've not gathered here just to talk about [music] the mechanics, Lord. But father, we've come here that the dynamics might come into the mechanics, Lord. Lord, that it would make this word live. It would make this church move in the power, oh God, of your resurrection. Now, Lord, I pray maybe one at home listening this morning, may you reach down and touch them, dear God, may you, Lord, may you give them the desires of their heart. If there be one that's grown cold on you, Lord, I pray there would come a fire of God off the altar this morning. And Lord, it would touch the heart of those that have grown cold. And Lord, it would it would rekindle a fire, oh God, in their hearts to return, Lord, unto the paths of righteousness, oh God. And Lord, we're committing this meeting today in thy faithful hands. Forgive us, Lord, of our failures, Lord. Forgive us of our shortcomings. Transform us this morning by your word. And we'll be sure to give thee all the praise, all the honor, and all the glory. For it's in the wonderful name of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ, we pray. And all the believers says, "Amen." And amen. God bless you this morning. And if you have your Bibles while you're standing with us, we want to go to the book of St. John, the 12th chapter. The book of St. John, the 12th chapter. I don't know if you can put some more lows in this. It's it's really changed on me. St. John chapter 12 and verse number 32. We sure Good to see everyone here in the house of God this morning. Those that have been away, good to see you here today. And how many is just happy to be a Christian? &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. St. John chapter 12 and verse number 32. I want to look here again. And then also we're going to look in Colossians 3. But beginning here in St. John 12 and verse 32, Jesus speaking, he says, "And I, if I be lifted up from the earth," I want to just point that out again. He's very specific here. &gt;&gt; "And I, if I be lifted up from the earth, will draw all men unto me." In the book of Colossians, the third chapter. Colossians chapter 3. I want to look in the first verse of Colossians 3. A very, very familiar scripture to us all this morning. Colossians 3 and verse one. Paul here writing says, "If you then be risen with Christ, seek those things which are above, where Christ siteth on the right hand of God. Set your affection on things above and not on things on the earth. &gt;&gt; If you then be risen with Christ, then set your affection on things above and not on things on the earth. We ask the Lord this morning to bless the reading of his word as you can have your seat here this morning. Uh if the Lord would help me today, I want to continue on a little bit with the thought here. We were speaking on Wednesday of spiritual concentration and uh maybe to to take another portion out of that this morning. I want to talk to you on this the power of concentration. We were speaking there on the uh concentrated on the attraction Wednesday and tonight or this morning rather I want to speak on this uh the power of concentration and brother Bram says here in 1961 and the message Jesus Christ the same. He said, "Now he only comes to those who are looking for him." Oh, he says, "I'd like for that to go home." He says, "I hope that stands as high as the trees down here before you." He says, "You cannot look without seeing it." See, he only comes to those who are looking for him. Now, amen. That's a that's a very powerful thing this morning. He only comes to those who are looking for him. And brother Bam said, "And I want to raise this so high." Amen. that you'll be able to see. He only comes to those who are looking for him. Jesus said, "If I, amen, be lifted up from the earth. I will draw all men unto me." Now again, that word lifted means to lift up on high. It means to exalt. It means to raise to the very summit of magnificence and prosperity. Of course, that word draw means to draw. Amen. By an inward power. It means to lead, to impale. Brother Ram would call that there an insight. And he says, "Of course we all know what an end sign is." Amen. It's something that's in a commemoration. Amen. It's lifted up something to people. Amen. To look to see. It's something placed before you. And God promised Isaiah the 5th chapter in the 26th verse. Amen. That there would be an end sign lifted up. Now, amen. As we were speaking there Wednesday, how the prophet of God would say, "And what is the attraction on the mountain?" He says, "See, so I've got my mind." Amen. Set on this message. Amen. It's that third pull. It's the one I must be loyal and reverent to. Now, uh just to refresh your memories, the first pull was healing, right? Amen. The second pull was prophesying. But that third pull, amen, was the opening of the word, the opening of those seven seals, amen, which would reveal the hidden truths that was hidden in the word. Amen. And it would give the bride something to concentrate on. Now, amen. That word concentration is the action, amen, or the power of focusing one's attention, amen, or mental effort. It's to pay close attention. It's attentiveness, amen, its single-mindedness, its absorption, its engrossment, it is focusing or centering. Amen. The centralization direction, it is to deal with one particular thing above all others. Now, amen. As we were speaking there Wednesday on that spiritual concentration, it is the practice, amen, of intentionally focusing the mind, amen, on a sacred object, a meaning or experience, amen, in order to deepen awareness, clarity, amen, and cause inner transformation. At its core, it is gathering scattered attention, amen, and directing it steadily toward what is spiritually essential. Now, amen. Spiritual concentration involves different elements. The first one being, Amen, a focused attention. Amen. It means you would choose a single point of focus repeatedly. Amen. And return to it when the mind begins to wander. Amen. It is an inner stillness. Now, I want you to listen to this. Amen. As attention stabilizes, Amen. mental noise begins to quieten. Amen. Amen. Though thoughts may still arise, Amen. But when you are spiritually concentrated, Amen. Those thoughts may arise, but they quickly, amen, will lose their grip. NOW, YOU KNOW THE PROPHET OF GOD SAID, HE SAID, YOU SITTING there in that wheelchair, don't think that. AMEN. DO NOT THINK THAT YOU'RE HOPELESS AND HELPLESS. AMEN. You're not. Don't let that negative thought ever pass through. Don't let it anchor, Amen. You can't help it from going through your mind. Amen. Amen. How many can TESTIFY YOU CAN'T HELP THOUGHTS, AMEN, from going through your mind. He said, but don't let it stop. AMEN. IT'S LIKE THAT OLD FARMER SAID, "I CAN'T KEEP THE CROWS." AMEN. From flying OVER MY PLACE. BUT HE HAD A DOUBLE BARREL SHOTGUN. AMEN. And he could keep them from roosting. So you can't keep the negative thoughts from coming. Amen. But you can keep them from roosting. He said, "See, you've got a shotgun." Amen. It's both the New and the OLD TESTAMENT. IT'S A DOUBLE BARREL SHOTGUN. THAT AMEN. That other element there of spiritual concentration is a meaningful intention. It it is unlike ordinary concentration. Amen. It is it is towards wisdom and insight. Now, amen. The prophet of God said you become born again. He said you become a new creature in Christ. Old things have passed away. Amen. The carnal things of the world, amen, has no more hold on you. And you have no more hold on them. See, amen. WHEN YOU HAVE PASSED FROM death unto life, when God gets a hold of a man, amen, the first thing he does in the church, amen, is bring it from worldliness unto holiness. And he brings it from death unto life. See, it's born again. It's new. It's ideas are new. He says, "What we need is a revival like that today." Amen. Oh, we've had a dip of the spirit. We've had spiritual blessings and spiritual uprisings, but we don't need that no more. Amen. We need a revival of the spirit of the LIVING GOD IN THE hearts of the people. He said, "WE DON'T NEED SO MUCH OF the dips of the spirit or a spiritual awakening." Amen. We need a revival. AMEN. AMEN. LET'S REVIVE WHAT WE'VE GOT. AMEN. NOT A SPIRITUAL AWAKENING. NOW, I find it amazing. Amen. That he says just a few months later, he says the last plague that hit Egypt was death. And he said the last plague that hits the spiritual church, amen, is spiritual death. He said, "And what we need today, amen, is a spiritual awakening." Amen. Now, a few days ago, he said we don't need a spiritual awakening. Amen. But here he says we need a spiritual awakening. BUT WATCH WHAT HE HONES IT DOWN TO. AMEN. A SPIRITUAL AWAKENING TO DISCERNMENT. AMEN. AMEN. YOU'VE GOT TO DISCERN WHAT YOU'RE FOLLOWING. YOU YOU'VE GOT TO DISCERN WHAT spirit is leading you. LISTEN, I THINK IT'S time we quit letting feelings lead us AND AND LITTLE INSIGNIFICANT IDEAS lead us. I THINK IT'S TIME, AMEN, to come back to being mature sons and daughters of God. Amen. That have received the Holy Ghost and thereby can discern what is right and what is wrong. Amen. He said, see, amen. That transformative effect. Amen. As one begins to spiritually concentrate, it begins to cultivate and it begins to cause transformation. Now, Rebraham said, "It's so beautiful." He said, "Now, God has done everything." How many believes that? &gt;&gt; More than his duty was to do. He sent prophets and priests. He sent his son. He sent the Holy Spirit. He's done everything. And even took an oath by himself that he would perform these things. NOW, WHEN GOD gets rich and deep down here, SEE, MORE YOU GET OF GOD in here, Amen, the more you'll BELIEVE GOD. AND BECAUSE THERE'S more of him AND THE MORE YOU CULTIVATE this down here. Amen. The more you CAN BELIEVE GOD. IT'S JUST LIKE A CHILD WHEN HE'S A LITTLE BITTY FELLA, maybe he doesn't know very much. Amen. BUT AS HE GROWS OLDER, he begins to get knowing more of God. And that's when this spirit in here, amen, takes the nature of our heavenly father, who is God, amen, like I take the nature of my earthly father, amen, from my earthly parent. NOW, AMEN. AND I WANT YOU TO CATCH THIS BECAUSE IN 1965 in the Easter Seal, amen, the prophet of God says this. He says, "What a privilege it is," Amen. to know that there is something in the resurrection that is pertaining to us. Amen. AMEN. WHAT A PRIVILEGE IT IS TO KNOW THAT THERE IS SOMETHING IN THE RESURRECTION, AMEN, that is pertaining to us. Now, amen. If you read Colossians chapter 3 and verse one from the Amplified Bible, it says, "Therefore, amen. If you have been raised with Christ, amen, to a new life, amen, you are sharing in his resurrection from the dead." Amen. Amen. There is something in the resurrection that is pertaining unto the bride. And if you have raised WITH CHRIST TO A NEW LIFE, AMEN. then you are sharing in his resurrection from the dead. You keep seeking the things that are above. Amen. Where Christ is seated at the right hand of God. NOW LISTEN. SET YOUR MIND. AMEN. AMEN. HELP ME NOW. SET YOUR MIND AND KEEP FOCUSED HABITUALLY on the things above. Amen. THE HEAVENLY THINGS. AMEN. NOT ON things that are on the earth which only have a temporal value. Amen. IF YOU HAVE BEEN DEAD IN SIN AND TRESPASSES AND HAVE BEEN MADE ALIVE BY CHRIST JESUS, YOU HAVE BEEN MADE A PART OF HIS RESURRECTION, AMEN, THEN YOU OUGHT TO CHANGE YOUR FOCUS. YOU OUGHT TO CHANGE WHAT YOU'RE CONCENTRATING ON. AND YOU OUGHT TO BEGIN TO FOCUS ON SOMETHING, AMEN, THAT DON'T HAVE TEMPORARY VALUE. AMEN. But it has eternal value. Now, amen. You all know THAT THERE IS A NATURAL mind and there is a spiritual MIND, RIGHT? AMEN. AND PAUL THERE IN COLOSSIANS 3, he is speaking, amen, of the spiritual mind. In Romans 8:6, he says, "For to be carnally minded is death, &gt;&gt; BUT TO BE SPIRITUALLY MINDED IS LIFE AND PEACE." NOW, BROTHER RAM IS SPEAKING IN 1953 of Cain in GENESIS 4. AND HE'S TALKING HOW THAT CAIN, AMEN, WAS CARNAL-MINDED, but Abel, Amen, was spiritual minded because Abel, amen, slew a lamb and he took the blood. AMEN. AND GOD LOOKED DOWN FROM HEAVEN AND HE ACTUALLY rewarded Abel. Y'all know that he REWARDED ABEL AND THE PROPHET OF GOD SAID, "WHAT WAS IT?" AMEN. SPIRITUALLY MINDED BY ELECTION. AMEN. KNOWING THAT THE earthly things doesn't please God, he offered life and blood. Now Paul GOES ON TO SAY IN 1 Corinthians 2:16, he says, "Who hath known, amen, the mind of the Lord that he may instruct him?" He says, "But we have, Amen, the mind OF CHRIST." AMEN. PAUL SAYS, "LET THIS MIND be in you WHICH WAS ALSO IN CHRIST JESUS." REVEREND SAID, "WHAT KIND OF MIND did he have?" Amen. Stay with the word. HE SAID, "THAT'S RIGHT. STAY WITH THE WORD." AMEN. THE FATHER'S WORD and defeated the enemy every time. Now, when the enemy attacks AND TRIES TO SAY, "YOU GOT TO DO THIS and you got to do that." Amen. SEE THAT ENEMY? HE'S TRYING TO DISTRACT YOU. HE'S TRYING TO scatter your attention. Amen. What are you GOING TO DO? YOU'RE GOING to stay with the word. AMEN. GOD SEPARATED HIMSELF AMONG US AND GIVEN HIS SPIRIT LIKE HE DID ON PENTECOST. AND IT WAS SEEN IN SYMBOLS OF FIRE. AMEN. FROM THE PILLAR. AMEN. THAT SEPARATED ITSELF AMONGST the people to GIVE HIS OWN LIFE OUT TO THE PEOPLE. AND THROUGH THIS, AMEN. THE MIND OF CHRIST SHOULD BE OPERATING AMONG US. AMEN. THROUGH HIS DEATH ON CALVARY AND THE SEPARATING OF HIMSELF in the upper room. AMEN. THE HOLY GHOST COMING INTO THE CHURCH. IT OUGHT TO BE DOING MORE THAN JUST MAKING US SHOUT. IT OUGHT TO BE DOING MORE THAN JUST MAKING US FEEL GOOD. AMEN. BUT IT OUGHT TO BE THE MIND OF CHRIST. AMEN. OPERATING IN every individual. HE SAID, SEE THEN THAT WORD OF GOD, AMEN. IT ALWAYS ATTRACTS, AMEN. THAT SPIRITUAL MIND. AMEN. WHY? BECAUSE IT'S THE MIND OF CHRIST in you. Amen. That knows the word is true. &gt;&gt; My Amen. THAT ONLY AMEN. THE SPIRITUAL MIND, AMEN. can see the promise of God and can see it coming to pass. When brother Ram speaks of the SPIRITUAL MIND, I LOVE HOW HE SPEAKS OF IT. HE'LL SAY, "YOU'RE PICKING SPIRITUAL things up." Amen. AMEN. OR HE'LL SAY, "OR THE SPIRITUAL MIND," AMEN. IS CATCHING THE MEANING BEHIND WHAT I'M SAYING. AMEN. HE SAYS, "OR GRASPING THE SPIRITUAL THINGS." NOW, AMEN. HE'S SPEAKING THERE IN 1963 of how that the storm was spoke out OF EXISTENCE IN COLORADO. AND HE SAID, "NOW, I COULDN'T TELL THIS." AMEN. Amongst people that's unbelievers. He said, "You only have to tell it to believers." And then because, amen, the unbelievers will never understand it. YOU GOT TO HAVE A SPIRITUAL MIND. AMEN. TO UNDERSTAND SPIRITUAL THINGS. AMEN. The word is spiritual. AMEN. AND IT'S INTERPRETED SPIRITUAL. THEN IF THIS IS A SPIRITUAL WORD, I SAY GOD GIVE US A SPIRITUAL MIND. AMEN. TO FOCUS ON THIS SPIRITUAL WORD UNTIL WE CAN BEGIN TO UNDER UNDERSTAND THINGS. AMEN. THAT DON'T HAVE TEMPORARY VALUE. AMEN. BUT THEY HAVE ETERNAL VALUE. LISTEN, I'LL TELL YOU THIS MORNING, YOUR LITTLE TROUBLE RIGHT NOW HAS TEMPORARY VALUE. AMEN. BUT THERE'S A SOUL ON THE INSIDE OF YOU THAT HAS ETERNAL VALUE. AMEN. THAT LITTLE ILL FEELING AND THAT LITTLE SPIRIT THAT YOU'RE TRYING TO CARRY AROUND. AMEN. THAT'S TRYING TO PULL YOU DOWN AND TRYING TO DISPLACE YOU AND TRY TO PARALYZE YOU. I WANT TO TELL YOU THIS MORNING, IT'S A TEMPORARY THING. BUT THERE'S A WORD CONCERNING THE CHURCH OF THE LIVING GOD. AND IF WE'LL TURN OUR EYES AND LOOK AWAY TO JESUS AND BEGIN TO FOCUS ON THAT, we will begin to understand what's really going on. Amen. And I think of how in John 6 when Jesus stood there AND HE SAID, "I AM THE BREAD OF HEAVEN." BROTHER, come [laughter] along. AND HE SAID, "NOW, HOW COULD HE BE BREAD and word, it would be puzzling TO THE CARNAL MINDS." AMEN. BUT WE ARE HOPING [laughter] THIS MORNING THAT THERE IS NO CARNAL MINDS AMONG US. OH, A GOD GRANTED HERE TODAY. AMEN. THERE IS NO CARNAL MINDS AMONG US. THAT THERE IS A SPIRITUAL MIND AMONG US THAT WE CAN UNDERSTAND. AMEN. WHAT THE FATHER IS TRYING TO GET TO US HERE. SEE, these words are puzzling, but at the same time, amen, THEY ARE SCRIPTURAL TRUTH. NOW, YOU ALL CAN AGREE WITH ME, AMEN, THAT A CARNAL MIND CANNOT stand a good service. AMEN. AMEN. A CARNAL MIND, AMEN, CANNOT STAND THE POWER OF GOD MOVING. IT CANNOT HANDLE, AMEN, WHEN THE BLESSINGS OF GOD BEGIN TO FALL. AMEN. THE CARNAL MIND, AMEN, WILL SAY THEY SHOULDN'T BE DOING THIS AND AND THEY SHOULDN'T BE DOING THAT. AND WE OUGHT TO TURN IT DOWN OR WE OUGHT TO TURN THIS UP. AMEN. IT'S A CARNAL MIND. AMEN. AND YOU KNOW WHAT A CARNAL MIND DOES? IT BEGINS TO CLAMP OFF. AMEN. THE FLOW OF THE SPIRIT OF GOD. AMEN. BUT I SAY LIKE A PROPHET SAID, "LORD, DON'T LET THERE BE A CARNAL MIND AMONG US." AMEN. LET THERE BE A SPIRITUAL MIND. AMEN. THAT WHEN GOD BEGINS TO MOVE, WE BEGIN TO CATCH, AMEN. WHAT IS HAPPENING IN OUR MIDST. COME ON, CHURCH. AMEN. THERE'S A DEVIL AGAINST US. THERE'S A DEVIL AGAINST YOU. AMEN. BUT GREATER IS HE THAT IS IN YOU. AMEN. THAN HE THAT IS IN THE WORLD. IT IS TIME. AMEN. TO CAST OFF THE CARNAL MIND AND GET A HOLD OF GOD UNTIL HE FILLS US WITH THE HOLY GHOST AND OUR MIND BECOMES SPIRITUAL. HEY. AMEN. SATAN IS TRYING AMEN TO NUMB THE SPIRITUAL MIND. AMEN. SATAN IS TRYING amen to numb the spiritual mind. Remember says what a privilege. Amen. TO TALK TO AN AUDIENCE LIKE THIS though feeling scolding sometimes in the spirit. It's only for correction THAT THE PEOPLE WOULD NOT BE SLOTHFUL. LORD, LET THEM KNOW THAT I love them and they know you love them. But Lord, they might be awakened out of this slump that the church is getting into. Their spiritual mind has be SEEN SO MANY THINGS UNTIL IT HAS BECOME NUMB. LIKE THE LITTLE BOY I spoke of, HE SAYS, "GOD, LET THE NUMBNESS leave tonight." AMEN. I THINK WE OUGHT TO PREACH HERE FOR A SECOND. AMEN. BECAUSE JUST BECAUSE, AMEN. WE'VE SEEN A LOT. DON'T MEAN GOD'S DONE DOING MORE. AMEN. AMEN. SOMEBODY SAY, "WELL, I'VE HEARD PEOPLE THAT THEY'LL GET A LITTLE DOWN OR GET A LITTLE UNDER SOMETHING AND ALL OF A SUDDEN EVERYTHING'S WRONG AND this is wrong with the church AND THAT'S WRONG." AMEN. AIN'T NOTHING WRONG. AMEN. WHAT'S WRONG IS YOU LET YOUR SPIRITUAL MIND, [laughter] AMEN, BECOME NUMB TO THE REALITY. AMEN. THAT THE GOD OF ISRAEL IS IN THE MIDST OF HIS PEOPLE. OH, BUT IF YOU CAN THIS MORNING SAY, LORD, AMEN, SHAKE ME AND LET MY SPIRITUAL MIND BE SHARP. AMEN. TO SEE WHAT YOU'RE DOING IN THE hour I'm living in. Amen. Don't be numb to the spirit. Amen. Don't be numb to spiritual things. WE ARE IN THE GREATEST BATTLE THAT HAS EVER BEEN FOUGHT. AMEN. IT'S THE BATTLE OF THE HUMAN MIND. AND THE BATTLEGROUNDS THAT WAS CHOSEN BY GOD, AMEN, IS THE HUMAN MIND. AMEN. NOW, WATCH WHAT A PROPHET SAID. HE SAID, "THE BATTLE OF THE HUMAN MIND has raged." Amen. Since the GARDEN OF EDEN, AMEN. NOW, SATAN STARTED THIS BATTLE ALL THE WAY back [clears throat] &gt;&gt; in the Garden of Eden. Reb said, "See, because decisions are made IN THE MIND, THE HEAD, [laughter] there is where Satan meets you." UH, COME ON. LET'S PREACH A SECOND. IT'S IN THE MIND. It's in the head. THAT'S WHERE THE DEVIL MEETS YOU. HE DON'T MEET YOU ON THE PARKING LOT. HE DON'T MEET YOU ON THE PEW. HE DON'T MEET YOU IN THE FOYER. AMEN. He meets you first in your mind AND THEN PLANTS THAT IDEA IN YOUR MIND AND YOU EITHER REJECT IT OR YOU ACCEPT IT. AND THAT DETERMINES ON WHAT LEVEL YOU'RE GOING TO LIVE IN. COME ON, CHURCH. AMEN. I'VE SEEN PEOPLE GET STUFF IN THEIR MIND AND IT BECOMES SO REAL to them and it ain't nothing but an OLD DEVIL. AMEN. TRYING TO CONFUSE THEM. AMEN. WELL, DON'T NOBODY LIKE ME. AMEN. I'M JUST GOING TO PREACH A SECOND. AMEN. DON'T NOBODY DOWN THE CHURCH HOUSE LIKE ME. AMEN. WELL, I WANT TO SAY THIS UNTIL YOU ASK EVERYBODY. AMEN. FROM THE OLDEST PERSON, AMEN. TO THE INFANT IF THEY LIKE YOU. YOU ARE LYING ON THE CHURCH. AMEN. AMEN. THAT'S JUST THE DEVIL TRYING TO TELL YOU THAT. I'VE SEEN PEOPLE SAY, "WELL, AMEN. I DON'T FIT IN AND I DON'T INCLUDE." AMEN. I TELL YOU WHAT IT IS. IT'S A DEVIL. AMEN. BUT IF YOU'LL COME BACK TO THE OLD LANDMARK, WHY ARE WE HERE ANYHOW? THIS AIN'T A SOCIAL CLUB. THIS AIN'T A BOYS CLUB. IT'S A HOUSE OF GOD. WE'RE NOT HERE TO SEE WHO'S WHO AND WHO DONE WHAT. WE'RE HERE TO WORSHIP GOD AND FOCUS ON THE THINGS THAT GOD HAS DONE IN OUR GENERATION. HEY, I think it's TIME TO TAKE THE HELMET OF SALVATION AND THE SWORD OF THE SPIRIT, WHICH IS THE WORD OF GOD, AND WAGE WAR AGAINST THAT DEVIL THAT'S TRYING TO PARALYZE YOU IN YOUR IN YOUR MIND. AMEN. I know what I'm TALKING ABOUT. AMEN. WE all fight mind battles. AMEN. WHEREFORE, PETER SAYS, "WHEREFORE, GIRD up the loins of your mind." Amen. Be sober and hope to the end for the GRACE THAT IS TO be brought unto you at the revelation of Jesus Christ. AMEN. NOW, WHEN YOU STUDY THERE IN THE HEBREW, that word loins, amen, was what the Hebrews thought, amen, the generative or reproduction, AMEN, POWER RESIDED. NOW I WANT YOU TO LOOK HERE IN ACTS CHAPTER 2. BROTHER Bam reads it from the EMPHATIC DIALOGUE AND HE SAYS IN THE IN THE TO BE FULLY and in the to be fully come the day of Pentecost. Now listen what he says and we're all with one mind in the same. HE SAYS NOW I LIKE THAT BETTER THAN ONE ACCORD. AMEN. CUZ YOU could be in one accord UP ON MOST ANY SUBJECT. YOU COULD BE IN ONE ACCORD UP ON MOST ANY SUBJECT, BUT HERE THEIR MIND WAS THE SAME. AMEN. SO, IT WAS NOT JUST THEY WERE ALL AGREEING on one little point. AMEN. BUT THEY ALL HAD THE SAME MIND AND WAS in the same place. Amen. NOW, DO YOU SEE WHY SATAN, AMEN, ATTACKS THE MIND? BECAUSE HE KNOWS WHAT HAPPENED BEFORE. AMEN. THE PROPHET OF GOD SAID, "IF THIS CHURCH RIGHT NOW COULD BE PUT TOGETHER and knitted together with such that every person would be in one ACCORD WITH NOT ONE SHADOW OF DOUBT ANYWHERE, THERE WOULD NOT BE A FEEBLE PERSON IN OUR MIDST IN ANOTHER FIVE MINUTES. THERE WOULD NOT BE NOBODY HERE DESIRING THE HOLY GHOST BUT WOULD RECEIVE IT IF YOU COULD JUST GET THAT CERTAIN THING FIXED." AMEN. NOW, THERE'S where the battle begins. Amen. RIGHT IN YOUR MIND. NOW WATCH A PROPHET. HE SAYS THIS IS NOT CHRISTIAN SCIENCE. THIS IS NOT MIND OVER MATTER. He says the mind accepts the life which IS THE WORD OF GOD AND there brings a life. HE SAID NOW JUST YOUR THOUGHT DOESN'T DO IT. BUT THE WORD OF GOD BROUGHT in the channel of your thought. SEE IT'S NOT THE THOUGHT AS CHRISTIAN SCIENCE makes it. Amen. Mind over matter. NO, THAT ISN'T IT. But your mind, are you WITH ME? YOUR MIND ACCEPTS IT. IT GRASPED IT. WHAT IS YOUR MIND CONTROLLED BY? Your spirit. And your spirit catches THE WORD OF GOD. AND THAT'S THE THING THAT'S GOT LIFE IN IT. [snorts] &gt;&gt; It brings life into you. Oh brother, WHEN THAT TAKES PLACE, WHEN LIFE COMES DOWN THAT CHANNEL into you, he says, "The word of God is manifested in you. IF HE ABIDE IN ME AND MY WORDS ABIDE in you, Amen. Then ask what you will and it will be done for you. AMEN. SEE, IT MUST BE accepted in the mind and then it's believed with a heart. AMEN. DO YOU SEE HOW POWERFUL THE MIND IS? WHAT YOUR MIND ACCEPTS BECOMES WHAT YOU BELIEVE. IF YOUR MIND ACCEPTS YOU'RE NO GOOD, THEN YOU'RE GOING TO BELIEVE YOU'RE no good. IF YOUR MIND ACCEPTS THAT YOU'RE A FAILURE, THEN YOU'RE GOING TO BELIEVE YOU'RE A FAILURE. IF YOUR MIND ACCEPTS THAT YOU'RE AN OUTCAST, THEN YOU'RE GOING TO BEGIN TO BELIEVE YOU'RE AN OUTCAST. BUT IF YOU CAN BEGIN TO ACCEPT, AMEN, THE AUTHORITATIVE PROMISES OF ALMIGHTY GOD, YOU WILL BEGIN TO BELIEVE THEM AND YOU WILL BEGIN TO MANIFEST THEM AND THEN THE WORD OF GOD BECOMES A REALITY. THEN EVERY SENSE OF THE SOUL AND BODY IS JUST SCOURED OUT WITH THE HOLY GHOST. OH, THERE'S NOTHING CAN COME UP IN THE MEMORY AND SAY, "WELL, I REMEMBER MISS JONES TRIED TO TRUST GOD and Miss Doe AND SHE TRIED TO TRUST GOD FOR HEALING ONE TIME AND she failed." SEE, IF THAT CHANNEL HAS BEEN CLEARED OUT AND HAS BEEN PURGED AND HAS BEEN FILLED ON THE INSIDE WHERE THE HOLY SPIRIT THAT DON'T EVEN COME IN MEMORY, NO MATTER HOW NO MATTER ABOUT MISS JONES AND WHAT SHE DID, it's you AND GOD TOGETHER AND NOBODY ELSE BUT YOU TWO. AMEN. There you are. AMEN. SEE, THEN THE MIND, AMEN, IS THE GATE TO THE SOUL, RIGHT? AMEN. THE GATE to the spirit rather. HE SAYS YOUR MIND OPENS UP &gt;&gt; AND ACCEPTS THE SPIRIT OR IT REJECTS THE SPIRIT. HE SAID NOW SEE IT'S YOUR MIND amen that opens up the DOOR OR IT CLOSES THE DOOR AND THEN AND LISTENS to your conscience or listens to your memory OR LISTENS TO YOUR AFFECTIONS. BUT WHEN YOUR MIND CLOSES ITSELF TO THESE THINGS AND LET GOD, AMEN. THE SPIRIT OF his word come in, IT BLOWS THE REST OF THE STUFF OUT. LISTEN. LISTEN. If you let the word COME IN INTO THAT MIND, EVERY DOUBT IS GONE. EVERY FEAR IS GONE. EVERY SENSATION OF DOUBT IS GONE. COME ON. I'M TALKING ABOUT A POWERFUL BOMB. I'M TALKING ABOUT GOD'S ATOMIC BOMB. AND BROTHER SAID, "WHAT IS GOD'S ATOMIC BOMB?" IT IS FAITH IN HIS WORD. IF YOU WOULD ALLOW GOD, AMEN, THIS MORNING TO DROP A BOMB ON THEM OLD DEVILS THAT'S TRYING TO LIVE RENTREE IN YOUR MIND AND CONVINCE YOU OF THINGS THAT'S REALLY NOT TRUE IF YOU'LL LET THE HOLY GHOST BLOW THEM THINGS OUT. EVERY DOUBT WILL BE GONE. EVERY FEAR WILL BE GONE. COME ON. BROTHER RAM SAID THERE WON'T EVEN BE A SENSATION OF DOUBT LEFT. &gt;&gt; MY GOODNESS. EVERY FEELING IS GONE. WELL, WE MIGHT AS WELL HAVE CHURCH. IT'S COLD OUTSIDE AND YOU DROVE OVER HERE. AMEN. HOW MANY SAY, "LORD, CLEAR OUT MY MIND. LET THE HOLY GHOST COME IN. LET THE HOLY GHOST DRIVE OUT EVERYTHING THAT'S UNLIKE THIS WORD. I'M NOT HERE TO BELIEVE IDEAS. I'M NOT HERE TO BELIEVE FEELINGS. I'M NOT HERE TO BELIEVE SENSATIONS. I AM HERE AS A SON OF GOD TO BELIEVE the word of God." Yes, sir. He said, "EVERY FEELING IS GONE. THEN there's nothing standing but the word of God." Are y'all ready for this? &gt;&gt; AND SATAN CANNOT BATTLE AGAINST THAT. &gt;&gt; My goodness. No sir. I I TELL YOU, I DON'T KNOW HOW MANY TIMES THAT OLD DEVIL'S COME AGAINST me in my mind AND TOLD ME THIS ABOUT ME AND THIS ABOUT ME AND YOU DON'T LIKE IT AND THIS AND ALL THEM. COME ON. WE ALL BATTLE IT. AMEN. BUT SOMEWHERE OR ANOTHER, YOU GOT TO LET THE WORD take control. &gt;&gt; Now listen, we got to get our mind set. WE GOT TO GET IT SPIRITUALLY CONCENTRATED. WE WE WE GOT TO GET FOCUSED. NOW, NOW FRIENDS, I'M PREACHING TO YOU. WE GOT TO GET FOCUSED BECAUSE THERE'S A POWER IN SPIRITUAL CONCENTRATION. DO YOU REALIZE AS LONG AS YOU'RE SAYING, "WELL, ONE DAY I'M IN, NEXT DAY I'm out. One day I'm up, next day I'm down. One day they're with me, NEXT DAY THEY'RE AGAIN." AS LONG AS YOU'RE LIVING LIKE THAT, AMEN, YOU'RE LIVING WITH A SCATTERED MIND. BUT IF YOU CAN EVER LET THE HOLY GHOST EVER FOCUS YOUR ATTENTION ON THE THINGS THAT ARE ABOVE, HE WILL ACTUALLY CAUSE YOU TO BECOME A CHRISTIAN. AMEN. NOW LISTEN, YOU WON'T BECOME A POSITIVE THINKER BY SOME 10STEP PSYCHOLOGY BOOK. BUT YOU WILL BECOME A POSITIVE BELIEVER, AMEN, BY THE CONTROL OF THE HOLY GHOST ON THE INSIDE OF YOUR SOUL. NOW YOU SAY, IS THERE REALLY A POWER IN CONCENTRATION? BROTHER SAYS HERE IN A DISCERNMENT, HE SAID, NOW HERE'S ANOTHER LADY. I DON'T KNOW HER, BUT SHE'S A CHRISTIAN AND SHE HAS FAITH. SHE'S A BELIEVER. AND GOD can reveal to me what's WRONG WITH THE WOMAN. IF HE CAN REVEAL what's wrong with this woman, he could reveal what's wrong with that woman or that person or this one here or that one up there or over here, wherever. Is that right? NOW LISTEN. IT'S WHEREVER YOU SET YOUR MIND AND WATCH IT WOULD TAKE PLACE. IT'S WHEREVER YOU SET YOUR MIND AND BEGIN TO WATCH IS WHERE THE POWER OF GOD WILL TAKE PLACE. DO YOU BELIEVE THAT? HE SAID, "THEN HAVE FAITH." AMEN. LOOK HERE IN PERSEVERANCE 62. HE SAYS, "NOW perseverance to be persistent." AMEN. TO TRY TO MAKE A GOAL. HE SAID, "YOU'VE GOT YOUR MIND SET ON SOMETHING AND YOU'RE PERSISTENT IN IT BECAUSE you believe IT'S THE THING YOU WANT." LISTEN, YOU DON'T JUST BELIEVE you want it. He says, "AND YOU BELIEVE YOU CAN GET IT." AMEN. LISTEN, I DON'T JUST BELIEVE I WANT A RAPTURE. I BELIEVE I CAN GET A RAPTURE. AMEN. I JUST DON'T BELIEVE I WANT A VICTORY. I BELIEVE I CAN GET THE VICTORY. I DON'T JUST BELIEVE I WANT A REVIVAL. I BELIEVE I CAN HAVE A REVIVAL BECAUSE THE GOD I'M SERVING IS THE GOD THAT SAID, "WHATSOEVER THINGS YOU DESIRE WHEN YOU PRAY, BELIEVE THAT YOU RECEIVE THEM AND YOU SHALL HAVE THEM." YES, SIR. AMEN. TO BE PERSISTENT. LISTEN, YOU'VE GOT YOUR MIND MADE UP ON WHAT YOU'RE GOING TO DO NOW. YOU CANNOT HAVE FAITH IN GOD WITHOUT KNOWING THE WORD OF GOD OR KNOWING SOMETHING ABOUT GOD. &gt;&gt; In the spirit of TRUTH 63, HE SAID, "YOU SEE DIFFERENT THINGS." LISTEN, LISTEN. YOU SEE THINGS DIFFERENT RATHER WHEN YOU GO TO FOCUSING. AMEN. YOU SEE THINGS DIFFERENT WHEN YOU GO TO FOCUSING AND USE GOD'S WORD FOR A FOCUS ON HIM AND YOU WILL SEE WHAT I'M TALKING ABOUT. HE SAYS, "SEE, BUT YOU GOT TO GET IT IN FOCUS FIRST." AMEN. SO, the first thing you GOT TO DO IS YOU GOT TO GET IN FOCUS WHAT YOU'RE TRYING TO ACHIEVE. AMEN. NOW, IN 1965, BROTHER BEN PREACHES THAT POWERFUL SERMON AND HE CALLS IT WHAT IS AMEN. the attraction on the mountain. REMEMBER? AND HE TAKES HIS TEXT FROM OVER THERE IN MATTHEW 21 AND HE'S TALKING ABOUT JESUS. REMEMBER AS HE COME RIDING INTO JERUSALEM AND BRAM SAYS, "NOW LISTEN." HE SAID, "NOW THERE WAS PEOPLE GATHERED THERE, AMEN, to see WHAT WAS GOING TO HAPPEN." HE SAID, "NOW WHAT DREW THEM BELIEVERS, AMEN, to Jerusalem AT THAT SPECIFIC TIME?" NOW, COME ON, SAINTS. AMEN, BROTHER DAVID. THEY DIDN'T HAVE NEWSPAPERS. THEY DIDN'T HAVE PHONES. THEY THEY DIDN'T HAVE LITTLE LITTLE UH CHAT GROUPS TO ADVERTISE JESUS WAS COMING. He says, "WHAT DO THAT? WHAT DREW him there?" HE SAID, "MANY PEOPLE BEING SPIRITUALLY MINDED." [laughter] AMEN. They knew HE WAS THE PASSOVER LAMB. AND BECAUSE HE HAD ALREADY TOLD THEM, AMEN, THE THINGS THAT WAS GOING TO HAPPEN. SO THERE WAS ONE GROUP THAT WAS SPIRITUALLY MINDED BY ELECTION AND they were watching FOR HIM. BUT THERE WAS ANOTHER GROUP THAT WAS CARNALLY MINDED AND THEY WAS WONDERING WHAT IS THE ATTRACTION. AMEN. I'm going to preach this morning. AMEN. BECAUSE THE PRO SAID YOU COULD FEEL, AMEN. THE PRESSURE IN THE ATMOSPHERE. He said God is watching over his word. Amen. TO VINDICATE IT. HE'S GOT TO MAKE IT REAL. HE'S GOING TO MAKE IT ACT. THAT'S WHY YOU PEOPLE ARE HUNGERING FOR A REVIVAL. IT'S TIME FOR THESE THINGS TO BE HERE. COME ON. THE REASON YOU FEEL THE PULL, THE REASON YOU FEEL THE HUNGER IS BECAUSE ACCORDING TO GOD'S CALENDAR, IT IS THE TIME FOR THERE TO BE A PEOPLE ON FIRE WITH THE HOLY GHOST AND LIVING SO CLOSE TO GOD UNTIL THE DEVIL DON'T KNOW WHAT TO DO WITH THEM. YES, SIR. WE GOT SO MANY TIES. AMEN. ONE PULLING this way and one that way and one again the other. How do people know what to do? Amen. Listen. and the pressure OF THE HOLY SPIRIT COMING DOWN. HE'S TRYING TO FIND A PLACE, AMEN, to move himself into that he can work, AMEN, WORD BY WORD. HEY, I DON'T KNOW ABOUT YOU, I SAY, LORD, LET IT BE ME. LET ME BE the place that you can move into and can begin to work your word, word by word. &gt;&gt; You love him this morning. In Matthew 21, those spiritual-minded believers, they had hearts that he could work in. Rebraham said, "AFTER ALL THIS NERVOUS ANTICIPATION, the church is asleep. The people's nerves was on edge, AND THERE WERE SO MANY PEOPLE THERE. AND THEN IT HAPPENED." AMEN. ON TOP OF MOUNT OLIVES COME A LITTLE WHITE DONKEY DOWN THE HILL AND PEOPLE FANATICALLY SCREAMING. They were pulling PALMS AND LEAVES OFF THE TREES. THEY WERE THROWING THEIR CLOTHES in the road. THEY WERE SCREAMING, "HOSANA!" AMEN. TO THE SON OF DAVID THAT COMES IN THE NAME OF THE LORD. THIS LITTLE MULE, HIS RIDER WAS NONE [laughter] WAS NONE OTHER THAN GOD'S ANOINTED MESSIAH OF THE HOUR. HE SAID GOD then what was he doing? WHAT IS THAT ATTRACTION UP THERE ON THE HEEL? IT'S GOD MAKING HISTORY AND GOD FULFILLING PROPHECY. AND THAT ALWAYS CAUSES AN ATTRACTION. IT BRINGS ALL THE CRITICS UP, THE VULTURES UP AND THE EAGLES ALSO. WHENEVER THERE'S AN ATTRACTION, IT'LL BRING THE CRITICS. IT'LL BRING THE VULTURES. BUT, BROTHER BRIAN, IT'LL ALSO BRING SOME EAGLES. AND I DON'T KNOW ABOUT YOU THIS MORNING, GOD, I DON'T WANT TO BE A CRITIC. I DON'T WANT TO BE A VULTURE. I WANT TO BE AN EAGLE THAT IS ATTRACTED TO THE CARCASS OF YOUR WORD. &gt;&gt; SOME COMING FOR CURIOSITY, SOME COMING TO FIND FAULT, OTHERS COMING TO CRITICIZE. AMEN. THERE'S ALL KINDS GATHERED. AMEN. WHAT'S ON THE MOUNTAIN IS PROPHECY BEING FULFILLED. NOW LISTEN, THIS IS ZECHARIAH 9. AMEN. THE SPIRIT OF PROPHECY PROPHESIED AT THIS HAPPENING IN ZECHARIAH 9. AMEN. REJOICE GREATLY, OH DAUGHTER OF ZION. AMEN. SHOUT, oh daughter OF JERUSALEM. BEHOLD, THY KING cometh unto thee. HE IS JUST AND HAVING SALVATION. He is lowly and RIDING UPON AN ASS AND UPON THE COLT. AMEN. THE FOE OF AN ASS. REMEMBER SAID, "NOW THIS WAS 487 years BEFORE IT HAPPENED." COME ON, CHURCH. THEY HAD BEEN LOOKING AT ISAIAH'S OR ZACHCHARIAH'S PROPHECY FOR 487 YEARS. THEY HAD BEEN FOCUSING ON WHAT ZECHARIAH SAID, "I'M PREACHING TO YOU." HOW MANY TIMES HAD THEY READ ZECHARIAH 9, BROTHER DAVID? HOW MANY TIMES HAD THEY BEGIN TO HONE IN ON IT? AND THEY BEGIN TO FOCUS ON IT BECAUSE THEY KNEW WHEN THIS SCRIPTURE BECOMES MANIFESTED, IT IS THE COMING OF SALVATION UNTO THE EARTH. OH, WHY COULDN'T THEY SEE THAT PROPHECY BEING FULFILLED? THE SAME REASON they can't SEE IT TODAY. THEY HAD TOOK THE WORD OF GOD AND MADE IT A NONE EFFECT TO THE PEOPLE BY TEACHING for traditions. AMEN. THE DOCTRINES OF THE TRADITION OF MAN. REVEREND SAID, "SEE, HISTORY WAS BEING MADE." BROTHER BRIAN, PROPHECY WAS BEING FULFILLED. COME ON CHURCH. SALVATION TO THE WORLD WAS ARRIVING. THE GREAT DAY THAT ALL THE PROPHETS HAD LOOKED FORWARD TO. ALL THAT WAS IN the grave WAS WAITING FOR THAT DAY. ALL THAT HAD DIED. ALL THE RIGHTEOUS OF THE BLOOD OF THE MARTYRS AND THE PROPHETS. YOU KNOW WHAT A PROPHET SAID? HE SAID EVERY PATRIARCH THAT WAS IN THE grave was waiting FOR THIS HOUR. AND THE CHURCH WAS BLIND TO IT. HE SAID THE CHURCH WAS BLIND TO IT. AND HERE'S WHAT THEY WERE SAYING. WHO IS THIS CAUSING ALL THAT NOISE? WELL, WE MIGHT AS WELL PREACH. WHO IS THAT FELLA? IS THAT NOT THAT CARPENTER'S SON OVER HERE? WHERE DID HE GET THIS WISDOM? RE SAID, "OH MY, HE WAS THE ANSWER TO THE PROPHET'S PROPHECY." THEY WERE QUESTIONING THE ANSWER. OH, CHURCH OF THE LIVING GOD. THAT HAPPENING WAS GOING ON AND THEY WERE BLINDED TO IT. &gt;&gt; THEIR SPIRITUAL MIND HAD BECOME NUMB. THE NUMBNESS HAD SET IN. THEIR MIND HAD SCATTERED. THEIR THOUGHTS HAD WONDERED. THEY HAD LOST THE ATTENTION. OH, BUT THERE WAS SOME, HALLELUJAH. THERE WAS SOME THERE THAT SAID, "NO MATTER WHO GOES, NO MATTER WHO COMES, NO MATTER WHAT YOU DO, I KNOW THAT THIS IS THE ANSWER TO THE PROPHET'S PROPHECY. I KNOW THIS IS MY REVIVAL. I KNOW THIS IS WHAT I'VE BEEN looking for." Hallelujah. What was it, brother? It was the happening. AMEN. IT WAS A HAPPENING. AMEN. CAN I SAY IT TO YOU THIS MORNING? IT'S A HAPPENING. SHAKE YOURSELF. AMEN. THIS DIDN'T JUST COME UP IN MATTHEW 21. BROTHER TOM, YOU COULD GO ALL THE WAY BACK TO GENESIS 3. AND FOR THE FIRST TIME, you could read IN GENESIS 3 WHAT WAS GOING TO HAPPEN IN MATTHEW 21. &gt;&gt; OH, I will put enmity between thee and the woman, &gt;&gt; and between thy seed and her seed. It shall bruise thy head, AND THOU SHALT BRUISE HIS HEEL. 4,000 YEARS. Are y'all with me? &gt;&gt; BETWEEN GENESIS 3 AND MATTHEW 21, PROPHECY HAD BEEN TRAVELING THROUGH THE BIBLE. PROPHECY HAD COME THROUGH THE BIBLE. AND GOD MAKES IT SO CLEAR AND PLAIN, BROTHER ED, THAT THE ONLY WAY TO MISS IT IS TO BE SPIRITUALLY BLINDED. BLIND RELIGIOUS LEADERS AND TEACHERS OF THAT DAY, LISTEN, HAD BLINDED THE PEOPLE TO IT. LOOK WHAT PAUL SAYS IN GALATIANS 1:8. He says, "Though we or an angel from heaven." That's right. &gt;&gt; Preach any other gospel unto you THAN THAT WHICH WE HAVE ALREADY PREACHED UNTO YOU, LET HIM BE ACCURSED. NOW, WHAT WAS THE APOSTLES BRINGING? THEY WERE BRINGING THE ORIGINAL WORD. AND THE PROPHET OF GOD SAID THAT ORIGINAL WORD WAS NOT CHANGED or could not change. NOT EVEN A DOT OR DASH OF IT. PAUL KNEW IT WAS GOD WHO HAD SPOKEN TO HIM. SO he said, "EVEN IF I COME AND TRY TO GIVE A SECOND REVELATION, TRY TO MAKE one little change of what I GAVE ORIGINALLY." PAUL SAYS, "LET ME BE ACCURSED." SEE, PAUL KNEW, AMEN. THE FIRST REVELATION WAS CORRECT. NOW, GOD CANNOT GIVE A FIRST REVELATION AND THEN A SECOND REVELATION. IF HE DID, he would be changing his mind. He said he can GIVE A REVELATION AND BROTHER CHARLES SAID HE WILL ADD TO IT AS HE DID IN THE GARDEN OF EDEN WHEN HE PROMISED THE SEED TO THE WOMAN AND THEN LATER DESIGNATED THAT SEED HAD TO COME THROUGH ABRAHAM AND THEN LATER SAID IT WOULD COME BY THE SAME BLOODLINES AND DAVID LISTEN BUT IT WAS THE SAME REVELATION. IT ONLY GAVE the people MORE INFORMATION TO HELP THEM RECEIVE AND UNDERSTAND THIS. DON'T YOU SEE WHAT THIS MESSAGE IS? IT IS THE REVELATION OF WHAT PAUL SPOKE OF TO GIVE YOU MORE INFORMATION THAT YOU CAN RIGHTLY DIVIDE THE WORD OF TRUTH AND IDENTIFY YOUR HOUR. IDENTIFY WHAT DAY YOU'RE LIVING IN. MY TO THINK THIS MORNING the seed came exactly as revealed. Reme said, "One of these days there is going to come A PROPHET TO THE LEODYSIAN CHURCH AGE, AND YOU WILL KNOW IF HE IS THE real one sent from God or not." OH YES, YOU WILL. FOR HE IS OF GOD. HE WILL BE IN THAT word exactly AS GOD GAVE IT TO PAUL, BROTHER. HE WON'T DEVIATE from that word. AMEN. FOR A MOMENT, AMEN. NOT BY ONE IOTA. AMEN. I'M GOING TO PREACH THAT DEVIL OUT OF HERE IN A MINUTE. YOU CAN SIT THERE AND HOLD ON to it all you want to. AMEN. IN THE LAST AGE WHEN THERE WILL BE MANY FALSE PROPHETS APPEARING, WATCH AND SEE HOW THEY WILL KEEP TELLING YOU. IF YOU DON'T BELIEVE THEM AND WHAT THEY SAY, YOU WILL BE LOST. BUT WHEN THAT LAST DAY PROPHET COMES ON THE SCENE, IF HE IS TRULY THAT PROPHET, HE WILL BE CRYING OUT, "GET BACK TO THE WORD OR YOU ARE LOST." HE WILL NOT BUILD ON A PRIVATE REVELATION OR INTERPRETATION, BUT HE WILL BUILD ON THE WORD. SEE, ZACHCHARIAH WAS A VINDICATED PROPHET WHO WAS SENT, AMEN, TO MAKE GENESIS 3 MORE CLEARER. COME ON, FOLKS. IN GENESIS 3 IS THE SAME AS ZECHARIAH 9. BUT IT DON'T SAY THE SAME THING, DOES IT? AMEN. IT DON'T SAY IN GENESIS 3, AND HE WILL COME ON THE F OF AN ASH. AMEN. RIDING INTO JERUSALEM. BUT IN ZECHARIAH 9, IT GIVES MORE CLARIFICATION TO GENESIS 3. AMEN. AND THEN IN MATTHEW 21, ACROSS THE HILL, AMEN, COME THE WORD FULFILLED. &gt;&gt; ARE Y'ALL HEARING ME? ZACHCHARIAH MADE IT MORE CLEARER. AND THEY STILL MISSED IT. YOU KNOW WHAT HE DONE? HE DESCRIBED THE VERY ATMOSPHERE that that word WOULD BE MANIFESTED IN. HE SAID, "WHEN HE COMES, THEY WILL BE SHOUTING. THEY WILL BE SCREAMING. THEY WILL BE REJOICING HOSANA HOSANA AND HERE HE COME FULFILLING THE WORD. SEE BECAUSE GOD DON'T FOLLOW the word he don't fulfill his word rather according to the modern trend of the day. &gt;&gt; Now now folks God fulfills his word to the people. &gt;&gt; And when God fulfills his word it always causes an attraction. &gt;&gt; It always does. &gt;&gt; See now look here. SO UNUSUAL WHEN HE FULFILLS his word to the modern trend of that day. NOW LOOK HERE CAUSE THE MODERN TREND OF THE DAY THEY don't even believe in it. NOW I WANT TO SAY THIS THE BIBLE IS full of unusual attractions. Amen. NOAH BUILDING AN ARK WAS AN UNUSUAL ATTRACTION. THE BURNING BUSH WAS AN UNUSUAL ATTRACTION. AMEN. THE OPEN OF THE RED SEA unusual attraction. MOUNT SI WHEN GOD MET MOSES IN THE FORM OF THE PILLAR OF FIRE, UNUSUAL ATTRACTION. MOUNT CARMEL, WHEN ELIJAH STOOD THERE AGAINST THE 400 priest ON THAT HILL. AMEN. IT WAS UNUSUAL. AMEN. WHEN GOD FULFILLED ISAIAH 40 ON THE RIVER JORDAN THROUGH JOHN THE BAPTIST, AMEN. IT WAS UNUSUAL. BUT YOU SEE WHAT'S HAPPENING IS THE ATTRACTION IS CHANGING. ARE YOU WITH ME? The attraction is changing. AMEN. FROM THE PROPHET UNTO HIS PROPHECY. NOW SEE ST. MATTHEW 3. AMEN. You can read the Bible of Isaiah 40. Are you with me? &gt;&gt; Are are you awake? &gt;&gt; Amen. AMEN. SHAKE YOURSELF. ISAIAH 40. AMEN. WAS FULFILLED IN MATTHEW 3. AMEN. GOD WAS VINDICATING HIS PROPHET'S MESSAGE. AMEN. WHAT ABOUT THAT ATTRACTION UP THERE ON MOUNT CALVARY? AMEN. WHEN THE PROPHECY OF THE OLD TESTAMENT WAS BEING FULFILLED RIGHT THERE, BROTHER TOM, AT CALVARY, AND THEY STILL DIDN'T KNOW IT. WHEN DAVID SUNG THE PSALM OF HOW THE SPIRIT OF CHRIST WAS IN HIM BEING FULFILLED, HE SAYS, "WHAT WAS THE ATTRACTION ON MOUNT CALVARY? IT WAS GOD FULFILLING HIS WORD." ON THE DAY OF PENTECOST, WHAT HAPPENED, BROTHER, WHEN THEY COME STAGGERED OUT OF THE UPPER ROOM LIKE A BUNCH OF DRUNK MEN, THE PROPHET OF GOD SAID, "AMEN." AND A PROPHET STOOD UP AMONG THEM. I LOVE THAT. A PROPHET STOOD UP AMONG THEM AS THE ORDER OF A PROPHET SHOULD BE AND SAID, "YE MEN OF ISRAEL, AND YOU THAT DWELL IN JUDEA AND IN JERUSALEM, LET this be KNOWN UNTO YOU, AND HEARKEN TO MY WORD. THESE ARE NOT DRUNK LIKE YOU THINK THEY ARE. BUT THIS IS THAT WHICH WAS SPOKEN OF BY THE PROPHET JOEL." LISTEN, WITHOUT A PROPHET, YOU CANNOT IDENTIFY WHAT'S HAPPENING. BUT IF GOD SENDS A PROPHET, HE'LL BE A WORD PROPHET. HE'LL BE A SCRIPTURAL PROPHET. HE WILL NOT POINT TO HIMSELF. HE WILL NOT ATTRACT YOU TO A CHURCH. HE WILL SAY, "THIS is that." &gt;&gt; Oh, the religious people were crucifying THE PRINCE OF LIFE, EVERYTHING. AND THEY STILL DIDN'T SEE THE PROMISE OF THE COMING OF THE HOLY SPIRIT. YOU KNOW WHAT THEY SAID? WHO IS THIS? COME ON. I'M PREACHING TO YOU THIS MORNING. WHAT MEANTH THIS? WHAT'S THE MATTER WITH THEM PEOPLE? OH MY. IT'S THE SAME THING TODAY. COME ON. ARE YOU HEARING ME? THIS IS NOT AN EXTRA THIS IS NOT AN EXTRACURRICULAR BIBLE MESSAGE. THIS IS A BIBLE MESSAGE BEING FULFILLED IN YOUR GENERATION. [laughter] COME ON. I'm going to preach A SECOND. AMEN. CUZ I DON'T THINK OUR SHOUTING OUGHT TO BE CONTROLLED BY THE MUSIC. I DON'T THINK OUR ATTITUDE AND OUR MOOD OUGHT TO BE CONTROLLED BY THE NUMBER OF PEOPLE ON THE PEWS OR BY HOW MANY PEOPLE IS LIKING OUR SERVICES AND WATCHING OUR SERVICES. COME ON, I'M GOING TO PREACH AND I'M GOING TO BUST THAT DEVIL AND YOU CAN SIT THERE AND WATCH ME. DON'T YOU REDUCE THIS MESSAGE DOWN TO ANOTHER SECULAR HOLLYWOOD SHOW OF WHAT CHURCH IS DOING THIS AND WHO CAN OUT PREACH WHO AND WHO CAN OUTSHOUT WHO. THIS IS THE FULFILLING OF THE WORD OF GOD IN THE GENERATION WE'RE LIVING IN. IT OUGHT TO BE MORE THAN A SUNDAY MORNING SERVICE. IT OUGHT TO BE MORE THAN A CAMP MEETING. IT OUGHT TO BE A REVIVAL BURNING IN THE HEARTS OF BELIEVERS. GOD IS HERE. HE'S IN OUR MIDST. BROTHER [laughter] MATT, HE'S FULFILLING HIS WORD. &gt;&gt; Oh my goodness. My church, our church, hogwash. [laughter] &gt;&gt; Ain't about my church and your church. And well, IF OUR CHURCH WOULD LIKE this church, if this church WOULD LIKE THAT, FORGET IT ALL. THIS IS ABOUT A BRIDE COMING TO PERFECTION UNDER THE MESSAGE OF THE HOUR. &gt;&gt; WELL, [snorts] [sighs and gasps] THE SAME THING IS TODAY. THE SAME THING IS TAKING PLACE. NOW, NOW I GOT A QUESTION FOR YOU, OKAY? CUZ B SAID PEOPLE BEGIN TO JUDGE THE SPIRITUALITY OF THINGS BY HOW MANY'S ATTENDING IT. &gt;&gt; Remember that? He said, WELL, THEY SAID, WELL, OUR CHURCH IS REALLY BLESSED CUZ THIS YEAR we got MORE MEMBERS THAN SOMEBODY ELSE. HIM SAID, "WELL," HE SAID, "SO DID PROSTITUTION GO UP." HE SAID, "SO IS THAT BLESSED OF GOD?" COME ON. I'M GOING TO PREACH. YOU SIT THERE LICK HIM IF YOU WANT TO. IS THAT BLESSED OF GOD? SAID, "NO." HE SAID, "IT'S CURSED TO THE DEVIL. YOU CANNOT VINDICATE THE BLESSINGS OF GOD BY THE NUMBER OF ATTENDEES." &gt;&gt; He say, "WHAT ARE YOU SAYING?" I'M SAYING, "CHURCH, YOU ARE SITTING IN A CHURCH THIS MORNING." AMEN. That just A FEW YEARS AGO WAS A CHURCH OF ABOUT 14 PEOPLE. AMEN. BUT TODAY, AMEN, GOD HAS SENT PEOPLE INTO THIS ASSEMBLY TO BE A PART OF THIS CHURCH. AMEN. YOU KNOW WHAT THAT IS? IT'S NOT BECAUSE OF MATT MORRIS. IT'S NOT BECAUSE OF ANDREW GLOVER. IT'S NOT BECAUSE OF ANYTHING, BUT ONE THING. THE WORD OF GOD HAS BEEN FULFILLED AND IT'S CAUSED AN ATTRACTION AND SOMEBODY SAYS, "I WANT TO BE THERE. I WANT TO WORSHIP IT. I WANT TO BE A PART OF IT." &gt;&gt; WELL, GLORY TO GOD. HALLELUJAH. NOW, NOW [snorts] people say, "Brother Ed, you're getting way out there." I love a prophet's humility. &gt;&gt; HE SAYS, "THIS MORNING, I WAS LEAVING THE CHURCH AND AS I WAS DRIVING BY, THE THOUGHT COME IN MY MIND, WHAT'S ALL THAT RACKET?" &gt;&gt; HE SAID, "I LOOKED UP AND DOWN THE STREET AND THERE WAS CARS FROM MICHIGAN TO FLORIDA, FROM MAINE TO CALIFORNIA. This morning WHEN I WAS RIDING OUT, WE WAS GOING DOWN THE STREET AND THE WIFE AND I WAS LOOKING AT LICENSE ON CARS AND I SAID THIS, "WHAT MEANTH THIS?" AND JUST AS I SAID IT, SOMETHING SPOKE AND SAID, "WHERE THE CARCASS IS?" WHERE THE CARCASS IS, THERE THE EAGLES WILL BE GATHERED TOGETHER. &gt;&gt; COME ON, CHURCH. DO YOU REALIZE IN THE FIRST POOL JEFFERSON FILLED UP THE TABERNACLE? IN THE SECOND POOL, THEY FILLED UP THE TABERNACLE. BUT WHEN IT COME TO THAT THIRD PULL, AMEN, THEY BEGIN TO PULL AWAY. AMEN. YOU KNOW WHY? AMEN. BECAUSE THAT THIRD PULL WAS NOT ATTRACTING A CROWD. IT WAS ATTRACTING THOSE WHO WERE ORDAINED TO THE CLOUD. WOO! GLORY. THAT THIRD PULL WAS NOT ATTRACTING A CROWD. IT WAS ATTRACTING BELIEVERS WHO WAS A PART OF THE CLOUD OF REVELATION 10. OH, GRACE TABERNACLE. I SAY UNTO YOU THIS MORNING, WHAT IS THE ATTRACTION? ON LAWRENCE COUNTY ROAD IN BLACK ROCKCK, ARKANSAS. THE CLOUD HAS APPEARED. THE POWER OF GOD HAS RETURNED. AND THERE'S A PEOPLE WHO'S READY TO LOOK AT IT. THERE'S A PEOPLE WHO'S READY TO PRAISE IT. THEY'RE READY TO SAY, "HOSANA." &gt;&gt; OH, they'll come from the east and west. They'll come from the lands of far to feast with our king, to dine as his guest. Rem said, "What is the attraction? the predestinated seed of God who can't do nothing else but follow it &gt;&gt; BUT FOLLOW IT. &gt;&gt; IT MEANS MORE THAN LIFE TO US. [sighs and gasps] &gt;&gt; TAKE OUR LIVES BUT DON'T TAKE THAT. &gt;&gt; WHAT IS THE ATTRACTION? GOD FULFILLING THE WORD OF ZACHCHARIAH. Are y'all ready for this &gt;&gt; again? Amen. [snorts] &gt;&gt; Again. &gt;&gt; No. &gt;&gt; Again. &gt;&gt; Zachchariah in the Bible. Word fulfilled. &gt;&gt; Again. Yes. &gt;&gt; SEE, IT SHALL COME TO PASS IN that day &gt;&gt; THAT THE LIGHT SHALL NOT BE CLEAR NOR DARK, BUT IT SHALL BE ONE DAY WHICH SHALL BE KNOWN TO THE LORD, NOT DAY NOR NIGHT, BUT IT SHALL [screaming] COME TO PASS. &gt;&gt; THAT at evening TIME IT SHALL BE LIGHT. &gt;&gt; SEE, WHAT DOES LIGHT COME ON? IT COMES ON SOMETHING TO BRING ATTENTION TO IT. COME ON, CHURCH. AMEN. THE MESSAGE OF THE HOUR. AMEN. IS CHRIST THROWING LIGHT ON THE SCRIPTURES CONCERNING YOU. &gt;&gt; NOW, Brother says it beautifully. He says, "We see the evening lights are here." Now, what does it do to have light if you don't have any eyes to see how to get around in it? &gt;&gt; Now, what is the evening light? The light comes on to reveal something. &gt;&gt; Is that right? Now, if you haven't got any eyes, then what's the use to reveal? There has to be eyes first to see, to reveal Malachi 4, to reveal Luke 17:30, to reveal John 14:12, John 15:24, John 16:13, and to also reveal Revelation 10:1-7, the opening of the seven seals. The seventh angel's message is to open up to reveal when the evening lights come. Now, folks, I'm I'm I'm not going to preach all day. I'm I'm preaching to affliction in my body, but I'm going to get through it. But but listen to ME RIGHT NOW. LIGHT HAS COME ON THIS WORD TO REVEAL IT UNTO YOU. &gt;&gt; SEE, IT'S LIKE IT'S LIKE YOU WALK IN A DARK ROOM. I've used this many times. You walk in a dark room and brother David, you're walking through there and you trip over something. Okay? You trip over it. Now, you turn around and there's NO LIGHT. YOU DON'T KNOW WHAT YOU JUST STUMBLED OVER. SO YOU CALL JONAH AND YOU SAY, "HEY JONAH, I JUST WON'T THERE." AND I STUMBLED OVER SOMETHING. WHAT DID YOU TRIP OVER? AND JONAH SAYS, "WELL, it's a chair." OKAY. AND THEN YOU ASK, "BROTHER MARK, WHAT THAT TRIP OVER?" AND HE SAYS, "WELL, I think it was a microphone stand." AND THEN YOU ASK BROTHER MATT, "WHAT THAT TRIP OVER?" AND YOU SAY, "WELL, I think it was the corner OF THE PULL PIT." OKAY, NOW YOU'VE GOT THREE INTERPRETATIONS OF ONE OBJECT. &gt;&gt; WHICH ONE ARE YOU GOING TO FOCUS ON? &gt;&gt; Which one are YOU GOING TO CONCENTRATE? IS IT A CHAIR? IS IT A MICROPHONE STAND? IS IT THE CORNER OF A PULL PIT? WHO IS RIGHT? WHAT DO WE FOLLOW? WHAT DO WE FOCUS ON? OH, BUT THEN THERE'S A MAN WHO CAN TURN ON THE LIGHT AND HE STEPS IN THE ROOM AND HE FLIPS A LIGHT SWITCH AND THE LIGHT STRIKES THE OBJECT AND FOR THE FIRST TIME, EVERY OPINION LOSES its own. AND WE NOW HAVE A VINDICATED ANSWER. IT'S NOT A CHAIR. IT'S NOT A MICROPHONE STAND. IT'S A MONITOR. ARE Y'ALL HEARING ME? AND FOR YEARS THEY WERE WALKING THROUGH THE SCRIPTURES AND THEY WERE STUMBLING OVER JUSTIFICATION. THEY WERE STUMBLING OVER THE RAPTURE. THEY WERE STUMBLING OVER WATER BAPTISM. BUT IN THE EVENING TIME IT SHALL BE LIGHT. THE MAN WILL BE HERE WHO WILL TURN ON THE LIGHT AND BROTHER NOAH FOR THE FIRST TIME. AMEN. A YOUNG MAN CAN LOOK AT THINGS THAT HAVE CONFUSED THEOLOGIANS AND SAY THIS IS the truth. ARE YOU HEARING ME? WHAT'S HAPPENING ON MOUNT SUNSET. IT'S GOD CONFIRMING HIS WORD. I'M TELLING YOU FOLKS, IT'S TIME TO WAKE UP. &gt;&gt; IT'S TIME TO WAKE UP. THERE'S A CONTRAST OF PEOPLE IN THE WORLD TODAY. I'M GOING TO BRING IT ON DOWN CLOSER TO HOME. &gt;&gt; IS THAT OKAY? &gt;&gt; THERE'S A CONTRAST OF PEOPLE IN THE RANKS OF OUR MESSAGE. IT'S THOSE WHO ARE SENSITIZED AND THOSE WHO ARE DESENSITIZED. AND SENSITIZED MEANS YOU'RE CAUSED SOMEONE OR SOMETHING TO RESPOND. &gt;&gt; TO MAKE SENSITIVE TO LIGHT. &gt;&gt; WHEN SOMETHING IS DESENSITIZED, YOU MAKE IT LESS SENSITIVE. BROTHER BRIAN, YOU MAKE SOMEONE LESS LIKELY TO FEEL THE SHOCK OR TO RESPOND TO WHAT IS HAPPENING. NOW, CAN I HAVE my liberty, brother Matt? TO MAKE SOMEONE LESS LIKELY TO FEEL THE DISTRESS AT THE SCENE OF CRUELTY OF VIOLENCE OR SUFFERING BY OVEREXPOSURE TO SUCH IMAGES. IT MEANS TO FREE SOMEONE FROM A PHOBIA OR NEUROSIS BY GRADUALLY EXPOSING THE PERSON TO THE THING THAT IS FEARED. NOW, NOW COME ON FOLKS, I'M GOING TO PREACH FOR A SECOND. AMEN. BECAUSE WE CANNOT WONDER WHY OUR SCHOOLS ARE BEING SHOT UP WHEN WE'VE HAD KIDS FOR 20 YEARS IN BEDROOMS PLAYING VIDEO GAMES, GOING IN BUILDINGS, AND MASSACRING PEOPLE LEFT AND RIGHT. I'M PREACHING TO YOU. WE CANNOT BE TRYING TO FIGURE OUT WHY RAPE IS AT AN ALL-TIME HIGH WHEN WE'VE HAD MUSIC THAT HAS DONE NOTHING BUT PROMOTE FILTH AND HAS DEVALUED WOMEN. AND COME ON, IT'S THE AGE OF DESENSITATION. desens where's my wife and I need her. She's got an English degree. IT'S THE AGE OF DESENSITIZING. THE WORLD IS DESENSITIZING YOU TO MAKE YOU NUMB TO WHAT'S HAPPENING. THEY'RE MAKING YOU NUMB TO WHAT'S GOING ON. COME ON. THAT'S WHY AMEN. 50 YEARS AGO, BROTHER BROTHER DAVID, 50 YEARS AGO, IF YOU WERE WALKING DOWN THE STREET AND SAW A BOY AND ANOTHER BOY HOLD HANDS AND KISSING, YOU'D HAVE TO FIND A TRASH CAN TO THROW UP IN. BUT TODAY, AMEN. IT'S ALL OVER THE PLACE. AMEN. 50 YEARS AGO. Come on. I'm I'll be How old am I? 29. I'LL BE 30 IN A FEW DAYS. I REMEMBER IN SCHOOL, SORRY, just kind of forgot for a second. Help me, JESUS. I REMEMBER IN SCHOOL WHEN A GIRL COME IN ACTING LIKE SHE LIKED A GIRL. IT WAS IT WAS [gasps] IT WAS THE WEIRDEST THING EVER. BUT TODAY, THEY GOT SUPPORT GROUPS FOR IT. DO YOU KNOW HOW WE GOT HERE? IS BECAUSE SOMEBODY BEGAN TO PROPAGATE SOMETHING UNTIL THEY DESENSITIZED AN ENTIRE GENERATION AND THEY NO LONGER FEEL THE SHOCK OF THE FILTH OF SODOM. THEY NO LONGER FEEL THE SHOCK OF THE VIOLENCE. IT'S STILL IN OUR STREETS. OH WELL, IF IT'S HAPPENING IN THE NATURAL, IT'S HAPPENING IN THE SPIRITUAL. MEN HAVE TAKEN THIS MESSAGE AND HAVE WATERED IT DOWN TO ANOTHER IDEA, TO ANOTHER APPROACH, AND THEY HAVE DESENSITIZED THE PEOPLE TO THE REALITY. THIS IS ZECHARIAH 14. THIS IS MALACHI 4. THIS IS LUKE 17:30. THIS IS REVELATION 5. THIS IS REVELATIONS 10. THIS IS THE BOOK OF JOHN THE 14TH CHAPTER. &gt;&gt; Sensitize you. [panting] [snorts] &gt;&gt; Can I preach a second? [panting and sighs] &gt;&gt; They desensitize you to the attraction by distractions. Brother David, they set up distractions around the attraction &gt;&gt; to desensitize you &gt;&gt; so when you see it, you won't be so moved by it. &gt;&gt; Brother, I'm going to preach a second. Is that okay, pastor? &gt;&gt; Back last year, we went down to Memphis. We went down there and and saw the uh they [laughter] down there in uh Memphis. They've got a &gt;&gt; [snorts] &gt;&gt; I'm gonna get it out. Boo devil. I'm not contagious, folks. One day it's 80, the next day at 16. Are you with me? &gt;&gt; Okay. We go down there to Memphis and there's a National Rights Museum and Civil Rights Museum. And it's actually the very location where Martin Luther King Jr. was shot and killed on the balcony of that Lorraine motel. And we got out. We was walking in and Matt noticed over on the corner like as you're walking up there too and on the corner there there was a woman sitting there with a stand with a bunch of pictures and a bunch of a bunch of paraphernalia, a bunch of propaganda, whatever papers handing them out. And so I remember Matt said, "I wonder what THAT'S ABOUT." WELL, I GOT TO LOOKING it up and you know what it actually is? It's a woman named Jacqueline Smith. AND YOU KNOW WHAT? She has been there in a solitary protest against that Lorraine motel in Memphis, Tennessee since 1988. SINCE 1988, THAT WOMAN HAS NOT MOVED. SHE HAS SAT THERE. Oh god, this is on YouTube. I'm going to PREACH Y'ALL. SHE HAS NOT MOVED. SHE'S NOT SAT THERE. SHE'S NOT SHE SAT THERE FOR FOR FOR FOR 37 years now. YOU SAY, "WHY in the world is she sitting there protesting for 37 years?" Well, when Martin Luther King Jr. came there, that hotel was a CHEAP MOTEL THAT THEY RENTED rooms to people at a very reasonable rate. And it was actually MORE OR LESS HOUSING FOR PEOPLE. But when he was killed up ON THE BALCONY, THEY STARTED LOOKING AT CHANGING that thing and making it more of A MONUMENT OR MUSEUM. AND SHE HAD A ROOM IN IT. SHE WAS LIVING IN THAT MOTEL. AND SO THEY WENT TO AND THEY SAID, "LOOK, WE'RE GOING TO MAKE THIS A WE'RE GOING TO MAKE THIS A A MUSEUM. You got to move out. I'm not moving out. NO, YOU GOT TO MOVE OUT. WE'RE GOING TO MAKE THIS A MUSEUM." AND SO WHAT SHE DONE WAS SHE BEGAN TO BUILD A PLATFORM of protest on THE BASIS OF THIS. NOW, WHEN YOU GO OVER THERE AND ASK HER, "WHY ARE YOU HERE?" SHE'LL TELL YOU THIS. MARTIN LUTHER KING JR. WOULDN'T STAND for this. &gt;&gt; Can I preach a second? SHE BEGINS TO CHANGE AND BEGINS TO TRY TO DISTRACT YOU FROM WHAT YOU'RE GOING TO SEE. SHE WANTS YOU TO WALK AND SHE'LL TELL YOU THIS. SHE'LL SAY, "THEY LITERALLY PICKED ME UP AND CARRIED ME OUT OF MY ROOM AND I SAT DOWN HERE TO TO PROTEST THIS MUSEUM BECAUSE IT'S NOT WHAT MARTIN LUTHER KING JR. WOULD WANT." AND NOW WHAT SHE'S DOING, SHE'S DESENSITIZING YOU TO GET SOMETHING IN YOUR MIND THAT WHEN YOU WALK IN THAT BUILDING THAT IT WILL NOT HAVE THE EFFECT UPON YOU AS YOU'RE LOOKING AT THINGS, YOU'LL BE THINKING ABOUT THAT POOR OLD WOMAN OUT THERE THAT GOT KICKED OUT OF HER MOTEL ROOM BECAUSE THEY TURNED IT INTO A MUSEUM. &gt;&gt; WELL, I'M GOING TO PREACH A SECOND. THAT'S THE WAY SOME OF YOU DO ABOUT THIS MESSAGE. THAT'S THE WAY SOME OF YOU DO ABOUT RELATIONSHIPS AND FRIENDSHIPS IS FOR YEARS YOU'VE BEEN SITTING THERE TRYING TO DESENSITIZE PEOPLE BECAUSE OF SOME LITTLE ILL FEELING OR SOME LITTLE CROSSWORD OR THE WAY SOME SITUATION WAS HANDLED. BUT I WANT TO TELL YOU THIS IN THE NAME OF THE LORD. IT'S TIME TO PACK UP YOUR PROTEST. IT'S TIME TO REALIZE THIS AIN'T ABOUT YOU. THIS AIN'T ABOUT ME. IT'S ABOUT THE ATTRACTION. COME ON. AIN'T NOBODY COMING IN FROM AROUND THE WORLD TO SEE THAT WOMAN SITTING THERE. THEY'RE COMING TO SEE WHERE MARTIN LUTHER KING STOOD. WELL, I MIGHT AS WELL PREACH. AND THERE AIN'T NOBODY COMING TO THIS MESSAGE TO SEE HOW IMPORTANT YOU ARE OR HOW UNIMPORTANT YOU ARE. HOW LIKED YOU ARE OR HOW UNLIKE YOU ARE. THEY ARE COMING TO THIS MESSAGE TO SEE ONE THING. THAT'S THE GOD OF THIS BIBLE HAS RAISED FROM THE DEAD. AND THE REVELATION IS BROKE. AND THERE'S SOMETHING IN THIS WORD CONCERNING ME. NOW, now [snorts] I read an interview. Somebody said these words. [gasps] They said, "We interviewed Miss Smith." And we asked her, "Why are you doing this?" And she responded, [snorts] "If they really cared, that museum wouldn't be there." You see what I'm talking about? People get in their mind about things. It's getting real heavy in here right now. &gt;&gt; God have mercy. &gt;&gt; I'm not a crazy man. People get things in their mind. They start focusing on it and they start concentrating on it and they get so attracted to it and they start desensitizing themselves and then before long they start trying to desensitize others. &gt;&gt; Listen, if you want to DESENSITIZE YOURSELF, GO ON. BUT IF YOU START TRYING TO DESENSITIZE others to what GOD IS DOING, GOD HAVE MERCY on your soul. I'm not a crazy man. I'm the word preacher and I'm in the burn right now. &gt;&gt; Well, this message is this AND THIS. NO, THIS MESSAGE IS CHRIST. &gt;&gt; And you CAN BUILD ALL THE PROTESTING WEBSITES YOU WANT TO AND AT THE END OF THE DAY, THE MESSAGE WILL STILL BE CHRIST BECAUSE IT'S THE ATTRACTION OF THE BRIDE. &gt;&gt; YOU SAY, "PREACHER, YOU LOST YOUR MIND." I HAVEN'T LOST MY MIND. I GOT ONE QUESTION FOR YOU. OKAY? WHY ARE YOU HERE? &gt;&gt; Why are you here? AMEN. CAN CAN I TELL Y'ALL SOMETHING? DON'T GET MAD AT ME. AMEN. MISS SMITH IS A SIDESHOW. IT'S JUST A LITTLE IT'S JUST A LITTLE SIDESHOW DOWN THERE. AMEN. TO KEEP YOUR EYES OFF OF WHAT MARTIN LUTHER KING DONE AND ALL THOSE THINGS IN THERE. IT'S JUST A SIDESHOW. AND I THINK IT'S TIME WE AS THE BRIDE OF JESUS CHRIST START IDENTIFYING WHAT SIDESHOWS ARE. THAT'S TRYING TO GET OUR ATTENTION OFF OF SEEING THE REVELATION CONTAINED IN THOSE SEVEN SEALS. &gt;&gt; Why are you here? &gt;&gt; Got a question for you, Carter. Why are YOU HERE, BROTHER MARK? WHY ARE YOU HERE? MATT, WHY ARE YOU HERE, BROTHER? BROTHER ROY, WHY ARE YOU HERE, BROTHER ED? WHY ARE YOU HERE, [gasps] BROTHER? BROTHER JARED, WHY ARE WE HERE? BRE SAID, "IF YOU'RE A REAL BELIEVER, YOU'RE SITTING HERE AND WANTING TO SERVE THE LORD. YOU'RE HERE NOT BECAUSE SOMETHING YOU'VE DONE." HE SAID, "NO, YOU BELIEVE IN IT, SO YOU'RE HERE." HE SAID, "WHY ARE YOU HERE? ARE YOU HERE FOR CURIOSITY?" I DO NOT BELIEVE THAT A RIGHT-MINDED PERSON WOULD COME OUT ON A NIGHT LIKE THIS FOR CURIOSITY. ARE YOU COMING TO SHOW YOUR CLOTHES? NO, SIR. I believe that A PERSON WOULD DO THAT. COME OUT ON A NIGHT LIKE THIS TO SET EIGHT HOURS IN A TABERNACLE CONGESTED AND jammed together in one of the overflow crowds ALL OVER THE PLACE. YOU WOULDN'T DO IT FOR CURIOSITY OR TO SHOW CLOTHES. IT'S BECAUSE THAT SOMETHING IN you is leading you to do it. &gt;&gt; Amen. Finally, my brethren, whatsoever things are true, whatsoever things are pure, I've been preaching an hour and one minute. Whatsoever things are honest, whatsoever things are just, whatsoever things are pure, whatsoever things are lovely, whatsoever things are of a good report, if there be any virtue, if there be any praise, then think on these things. those things which you have both learned and received and heard and seen in me. Do and the God of peace shall be with you. Look at this word. Look at this word thank. It means to impute. &gt;&gt; Can I have just a few minutes here? &gt;&gt; It means to impute. It means to pass to one's account. &gt;&gt; Now, now this word actually deals with reality. this word think. If I think or reckon that my bank book has $25 in it, it has $25 in it. Otherwise, I am deceiving myself. &gt;&gt; This word refers to facts and not suppositions. &gt;&gt; You know what suppositions are? They're uncertain beliefs. &gt;&gt; There's no fact to them. There's no bottom to it. There's no foundation. It's just something that you just come up with and you think about and think about. But but look here what Paul says. He says in Romans 5:12, I want to give you a few things to think on. Okay? As by one man sin entered into the world and death by sin and so death passed upon all men, for that all have sinned. Look here in verse 14. Nevertheless, death reigned from Adam to Moses, even over them that had not sinned after the similitude of Adam's transgression, who is the figure of him that was to come. Now look here in verse 17. For if by one man's offense death reigned by one, much more they which receive abundance of grace and of the gift of righteousness shall reign in life by one Jesus Christ. You say, "Preacher, why are you saying that?" Because I want you all to hear this and I want you to hear it very plainly. This is God's program. &gt;&gt; There is a people on the earth today who is going to escape the tribulation. There is a people on the earth today who is going to escape a sinner's grave and a devil's hell. There is a people today on the earth who is going to escape the great plagues that are coming up. Are you hearing me? There is a PEOPLE YOU SAY THEN HOW DO I BECOME OF THAT PART OF THAT? ARE YOU READY FOR IT? HERE IT IS. GOD SPEAKS HIS WORD. GOD CONFIRMS THAT THE WORD AS BEING HIS WORD. GOD SPEAKS HIS WORD. THEN GOD CONFIRMS THAT WORD AS BEING HIS WORD. And then WE ARE RESPONSIBLE TO BELIEVE THAT WORD. AND IN THE SIMPLE ACT OF BELIEVING IT, GOD LOOKS DOWN AND SAYS, "YOU ARE [screaming] RIGHTEOUS." &gt;&gt; CHURCH OF THE LIVING GOD. AS YOU FOCUS ON THESE REVELATIONS, AS YOU CONCENTRATE ON THESE THINGS UNDER THAT THIRD POOL, GOD BEGINS TO DEPOSIT THE POWER. GLORY TO GOD. I FEEL LIKE DANCING. GOD BEGINS TO GLORY. HE BEGINS TO DEPOSIT THE POWER OF WHAT YOU'RE FOCUSING ON INTO YOUR ACCOUNT. COME ON, CHURCH. BROTHER SAID, "THERE WAS A MAN THE OTHER DAY WHO HAD A PSYCHIC MENTAL FAITH." AND BROTHER CARTER, HE SO CONCENTRATED ON A GLASS OF WATER UNTIL HIS NATURAL CONCENTRATION THROUGH A PHYSIC OR THROUGH A PSYCHIC MENTAL FAITH, BROTHER TOM, IT BROKE. ARE Y'ALL HEARING ME, BROTHER WESLEY? HE'S SO FOCUSED ON IT UNTIL HIS CONCENTRATION HAD THE POWER THROUGH A PSYCHIC MENTAL FAITH TO BREAK THAT GLASS AND THE WATER RAN OUT OF IT. BUT SAID, [laughter] "OH, OH, if a MAN CAN DO THAT BY A MENTAL THINKING, HE'S A FALLEN, PERVERTED CONDITION. WHAT IF THAT MAN CAN EVER GET BACK TO GOD?" [gasps] &gt;&gt; SISTER VANNA AND THE POWER OF GOD COME IN THERE. HE SAID, 'YOU KNOW WHAT'LL HAPPEN? HE SAID, 'LOOK, that spirit that's in a man could be converted and you put CHRIST IN THERE. WHO IS CHRIST? THE WORD. WHAT IS THE MESSAGE? CHRIST WHEN HE'S GOT A CONDUCTOR. AND LET A MAN WITH THAT SAME FAITH IN THE CONDUCTOR OF THE WORD OF GOD. He can raise the dead. &gt;&gt; He can cleanse the lepers. He can cast out devils. Listen, if a natural man by his psychic mental faith can concentrate and break a glass of water, what about the offspring of God? &gt;&gt; What about you that's been born again? &gt;&gt; What about you that's got more word in you than some people's ever heard in their entire life? Some of these young people sit here have heard more revelation in their life than than than theologians have heard in years of going to seminary. You say, "Why are you saying that?" Because what could happen if you would begin to focus, if you would begin to concentrate on the promises of God, with the faith, with a spiritual mind of that spiritual revealed truth. What if you would begin to focus on it and you were not looking at it and saying, "Is this the truth? &gt;&gt; Could this be [clears throat] the truth? Is this really about me? Am I really an overcomer? Am I really a part of this? Am I am I am I just am I just here because I'm married into it? or am I just a part of this because my my father was in it? Am I? No. If you could start concentrating on those things that's been revealed, can I tell you what'll happen to you? Can I tell you? YOU'LL BEGIN TO CRUSH that demon of guilt and condemnation. &gt;&gt; If you would begin TO FOCUS ON THE POWER OF THE BLOOD AND begin to focus on the revelations contained in those seven SEALS UNDER THAT THIRD PULL, LISTEN. COME ON, FOLKS. IT WASN'T UNDER THE FIRST PULL THAT THIS CAME. IT WASN'T UNDER THE SECOND PULL THAT THIS CAME, BUT UNDER THE THIRD PULL. ABRAHAM SAID LIKE THAT LITTLE ONE. Oh church, I'm out of time, but I got it ON MY HEART. IT'S LIKE THAT LITTLE WOMAN IN JOHN 4. YOU KNOW WHAT THE PRO OF GOD SAID? HE SAID SHE WAS WALKING AROUND ONE day and she was CONCENTRATING ON SOMETHING. YOU KNOW WHAT SHE WAS CONCENTRATING ON? BROTHER DAVID PAUL. HE SAID SHE WAS CONCENTRATING ON THIS. I'VE MESSED UP MY LIFE. I'VE BEEN MARRIED TO SIX MEN. I'M IN A HORRIBLE CONDITION. I'VE SENT MY DAY OF GRACE AWAY. SHE HE SAID, "OH YEAH, THAT'S WHAT SHE WAS THINKING ABOUT." SHE WAS CONCENTRATING ON THAT. HE SAID, "BUT THEN THERE WAS SOMETHING ELSE INSIDE OF HER." OH, GLORY TO GOD. THERE WAS SOMETHING ELSE INSIDE OF HER. IT WAS A SEED. AND HE SAID, "THEN THE SEED BEGAN TO SAY, BUT ONE DAY THE MESSIAH WILL COME AND SHE SAID ALL OF A SUDDEN SHE LOOKED AWAY TO JESUS AND SHE SAW THE MESSIAH." LISTEN. AND WHEN SHE BE TO FOCUS ON THE ATTRACTION OF THE FULFILLMENT OF THE WORD OF GOD, IT RELEASED THE POWER IN HER AND SHE BROKE THE DEMON OF GUILT. SHE BROKE THE DEMON OF CONDEMNATION. COME ON, GRACE TABERNACLE. WE'VE HAD A PROPHET IN THIS LAST DAY TO SAY THIS. YOU ARE STANDING COMPLETELY JUSTIFIED AS THOUGH YOU NEVER DID IT AT the beginning. WHERE WAS THAT LAYING UNDER THAT THIRD PULL? HALLELUJAH. You know what he says? He said, "This is my message &gt;&gt; to the church now. You are the pure, virtuous, sinless bride of the son of the living God. [clears throat] &gt;&gt; Let our musicians come. Every man and woman that's born of the spirit of God, washed in the blood of Jesus Christ, believes every word of God, stands. Are y'all ready for this? [sighs] &gt;&gt; I'm I'm talking to you. I've been I've been looking at some things. I've been concentrating [snorts] on some things, brother Matt. I've been I've been I've been focusing on what a prophet said. And this is what he said. He said, "Every man and woman and born the spirit of God." How many is born of the spirit of God? Can I see your hand? &gt;&gt; You've been washed in the blood of Jesus Christ. Can I see your hand? &gt;&gt; You believe every word of God. stand as though you never sinned &gt;&gt; at the first place. You are perfect if we can so concentrate on these things that's been revealed. [music] You know what a prophet of God said? He said these things will begin to transform your mortal body. Abraham said we're going to meet Jesus in the air before we get home. That's right. We're going to meet him in the air. He said, "We which are alive and remain shall not prevent or hinder those which are asleep." You know what he said? He said, "It's a perfect type of Rebecca." Rebraham said, "She jumped out of that out of that wagon. She met Elijah in the middle of the air." Met Isaac rather, sorry, Elijah letter to Isaac. Reb said, "We which are alive and remain shall be called up to meet the Lord in the air." He said, "Now therefore, now now can I say something to you? Where did revelation of theophony come? Under that third pool. Therefore, the theophony, [music] if you have died and entered into that theophony, what happens? The theophony comes to the earth [music] to pick up the redeemed body. And if you're here in the air, oh God, you take the body to meet the theophony. There you are and called up and go to meet the Lord. Oh little eaglet, maybe some little girl, some little boy or some old person or middle-aged. Why are you here this morning? You know what a prophet said? I love it. Because that you're really an eagle. [music] &gt;&gt; Won't you stand to your feet with us today? Why are you here this morning? [music] Because you really are an eagle. But maybe the cares of life has kind of battled you around roughly and you've lost sight. You're not too sure no more where you're placing your foot. Let's just come up against the rock now. Rocks of revelation, right? Oh, lead me to that rock that is higher than I. Let me lay on this rock. He's a shelter in a time of [music] storm. See, start beating against the door right now. Beating against the door of this rock. He'll open up. How many believes that the crust will fly off. [music] Then the pressure will leave you and you can be at rest again. Pressure all gone. You can come to church no matter what the pastor preaches about. Long as he [music] stays in the word of God, it'll never condemn you. You've done anchored in there. You're all right now. &gt;&gt; [music] &gt;&gt; Oh church, I don't know about you, but today I say Lord, I don't want to give my attention to no sideh shows. Lord, don't let anything desensitize me to this word. Lord, I don't want to I don't want to stop and ask him why you set up over here. Why you why you why you got all this? Why what what's so important about your protest? [music] No, I want to ignore it. &gt;&gt; I want to walk in there. Come on, church. I wonder, brother David, I wonder how many people have traveled across the world [music] and got down there to Memphis to see that museum and that site and walk by that lady and talk to her, let her let her tell them all the nonsense and stuff and get it in their minds. And then they go in there and they start seeing things and they can't really absorb it. They can't really look at it. They can't really engross themselves in it and read all the things because in their mind they're thinking about folks. I'm preaching to y'all. We may not be shouting, but we're preaching. How many How How many of you all say, "Lord, just [music] come by today and purge my mind." &gt;&gt; You know what I'm talking about. Purge my mind. [music] Lord, wash it today. Y'all, y'all y'all sometimes you get on them YouTube channels and start surfing around and hear some guy preaching against the moving of God. Sideshow. [music] &gt;&gt; It's a sideshow. &gt;&gt; It's a protest. &gt;&gt; Hear some man get up and start preaching against the move of God. And then you come down here to Grace Tabernacle where we believe in the move of God. &gt;&gt; And we believe in shouting and dancing and rejoicing and the power of God starts falling and some raise up in your mind and you start &gt;&gt; Jesus. &gt;&gt; See maybe somebody come by and brother told me one time he said you know I'm I'm going to tell something here a little bit. I'm not going to tell too much but I'm going to tell enough [music] of it. He said you know he said somebody told me something. He said about that church down there y'all's church. Grace Tabernacle. He said, "You know, I listened to it." And he said, "I believed it." He said, "I really didn't know." He said, "But then I just come and sing for myself." Goes to this church. Said, "Then I come and sing for myself." And said, "Now I know what's going on in there." &gt;&gt; See, you got to get your eyes off the sideh shows. &gt;&gt; This is a third pull church. [music] &gt;&gt; This is a word church. &gt;&gt; We're not focusing on everything around the protest. We're focusing on the message. &gt;&gt; We're going to concentrate on it till we can stand here and preach it so authoratively to you that you'll break every demon of condemnation. &gt;&gt; Take anything you want to from us, but don't take that message. &gt;&gt; And I'm going to tell you something. I'm going to tell you something this morning. In the name of the Lord, any devil starts telling you that the house of God ain't important, it's a lying spirit. Yes, &gt;&gt; you can call it what you want to. It's a devil trying to [music] protest the move of God. &gt;&gt; And you're looking at one preacher that's not ashamed to say it's a devil. &gt;&gt; Ain't no time for these sideh [music] shows. There's a rapture coming. &gt;&gt; There's a body change coming. There's a resurrection coming. And there's something in it pertaining to you. &gt;&gt; If the devil's trying to knock you out, it's because he knows there's something in it pertaining to you. &gt;&gt; Stand your ground. Jesus ain't got no time for sideshows. Brother David, &gt;&gt; I'm concentrated. &gt;&gt; How many bow your hearts with me this morning? Just [music] raise your hand. Say, "Lord, I ain't got no more time for sideshows. I don't have time for people's hurts and people's feelings and people's ideas. I don't have time to give my attention to that." Compassionate, yes. Loving, yes. Caring, yes. But Lord, I wonder how many in here today would say, 'Lord, give me that spiritual discernment. Lord, give me that spiritual discernment to discern between whether it's a it's a need or it's a spiritual protest. [music] Lord, would you give me that discernment when I talk to people that they begin to tell me things? Maybe maybe somebody begins to tell you something about the message. Say, Lord, give me that spiritual discernment to pick up. It's a spiritual protest. It's somebody that's trying to do something to stop the faith. Maybe you're sitting here today and friendships, relationships are are becoming strained because of different directions and paths ones [music] have taken. But you say today, Lord, I want I want confidence and grace in my heart to stand on my convictions. I don't I don't want to waver. I don't want to bow. I want to stand. God bless you there. God bless you. I ask you [music] this morning as the spirit of the Lord's moving and every heart is bowed right now. Hands up all over the building. God bless you. He sees your hands up there, brother. He sees your hands. I want to ask you right now, would you say, Lord, come by my way and purge my mind right now. Purge my mind. I want to leave this service today with a renewed mind. I want a renewed mind of the assembly. I want a renewed mind of my brother. I want a renewed mind towards my sister. Maybe the devil been trying to plant something in your mind against the ministry. You say, "Lord, I want a renewed mind today." Maybe a husband and a wife, the devil's trying to trying to get between you or a family or relationships there. And you say, "Today, Lord, I want a renewed mind. [music] Lord, I want the spiritual mind. I want the mind that has the ability to discern whether this is good or evil." Almighty God, we bow our hearts in your presence today, Lord. Father, these are your eagles. Lord, these are your children. And Lord, your spirit is here among us. Your spirit is here. And Lord, though there may be heavy hearts, though there may be though there may be torn spirits, Lord, Father, we're standing here today upon the confidence of knowing that this message is the attraction. Lord, it's the it's the drawing power. It's you fulfilling your word. Now, Lord, I pray for every one of my brothers and sisters. I raise my hand today with them, dear God. Though I've stood here and labored and delivered these things you put up on my heart. Lord, I want to leave here with a renewed mind. Lord, I want a renewed mind. Lord, I don't want to give any attention to little sideesh shows. Lord, I don't want to I don't want to give any attention to little protests. Lord, [music] Father, I want to give my whole attention to this word, Lord. I want to be like your prophet. I I want to give everything I am to this third pull. Lord, I want to give my my strength. I want to give my efforts to it. Lord, every everything I can do, everything I can say, Lord, I want to give it under this third pull. [music] Father, your spirit is here today. Lord, maybe there's a person sitting here today and your word is spoke to them. Maybe they've stopped and asked, "Why are you set up here? What's your purpose? What's your what's your issue? What's your protest? And Lord, maybe somebody has sold to them their issues. And now, Lord, they're holding on to those issues. And now, Father, things are desensitizing them. Lord, little words, little little jokes, little little things, oh God, that should should not be in our fellowship have begun to desensitize. Oh, I'm asking you today, dear God. Come by our way today, Lord. Shake us, Father. renew our sensitivity to your word. Oh, I wonder today how many could raise your hands. Oh, you could raise your hands right now and say, "Lord, Lord, come by my way today. Lord, I've I've I've let I've let some little something get in my mind. I've let that become the leadership. I've let that become the thing by which I make my decisions." Maybe you've let something come in your mind and you've let that become the hindrance between you and worship and God in the services and you're ready today to say, "Lord, take it away. I want a new mind, Lord." Spiritually concentrated. Spiritually concentrated. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Not pass. Oh come in our oh gentle gentle savior Savior. [music] Oh, he you say, "Lord, come by my way today." &gt;&gt; Humble. [music] I [music] mother I call to not pass me. Oh yes. [music] Crying save. &gt;&gt; Is that your cry [music] today? Oh, &gt;&gt; oh yes. Hear [music] my heart [music] cry. And while [music] there's thou art come, is that your prayer today? Oh, do you not pass me by? As I play that softly, just before we turn the service to brother Matt, I want to say something to you. You know, you can go through things and you can go through situations and things can happen and you can get a resistance built up in your heart and really really what you're what you're offended at is the wrong thing. Y'all know that. You probably heard me tell it before, but I was preaching over at brother Josh [music] Bennett one time and I got to dealing with offenses and how people get offended and things happen and situations. And I said it's like people they get offended at this message because some [music] man said something or some man taught something and rather than bringing a grace upon their heart, it brought a bondage or or or a legalism. And when I said that, there was a lady sitting about where you are, Sophie. She's sitting over there and she just raised her hands, sister, older sister, and just started praising God. And I noticed that struck her and she come to me after service. She said, 'But Andrew," she said, 'I've been I've been in church for years in the message. She said, 'But the past 26 years, she said, 'I've been going to church. She said, but I have been so bothered when somebody starts talking about the message and talking about that prophet. [music] So, she said, I just just been so offended. I said, Lord, what's going on? is she said 26 years ago she said a man took a sermon built some quotes and preached that whole sermon right there at me and said it so offended me said I just got offended the message and she said but this morning when you took time and showed there's a difference in the message and what a [music] man does with the message she said there was a grace just come over my heart &gt;&gt; and she said I'm done resent it &gt;&gt; she said I can't wait to get back in church I can't wait to hear it again you See, that's that's the power of concentrating on this message. Listen, I've said it to you before and I'll say it again. I will not preach the word of God to beat a person. &gt;&gt; But I will preach the word of God to beat the fire out of the spirit. &gt;&gt; Cuz it's the spirit. &gt;&gt; It's not the person. And if the spirit ever gets broken and the person begins to get up out from underneath the leadership of that spirit &gt;&gt; and they begin to see there really is something going on. &gt;&gt; This is more than noise. This is more than building a church. This is more than just gathering twice a week. But this is a revival. [music] &gt;&gt; Oh, what a joy will come in your heart. Do you love him today? &gt;&gt; We say God bless you all. Thank you for being here this morning. Pray for us the meeting this afternoon. Amen. come if you can and tend it and support it and get behind the young people. Amen. We're doing these to to press forward. We're moving forward. Amen. [music] You love him this morning. Amen. I say thank God there's there's a few churches left in the land today that's preaching this message and building the hearts of the people in this message and not in themselves. Oh church, we ought to raise our hands right now and say, "Lord, thank you. &gt;&gt; Thank you." Brother Matt, would you come? God bless you friends. Remember in prayer we'll be leaving Lord willing tomorrow for New Zealand. We'll be gone for a week. So those of you that just remembers in prayer, we love you all with the love of the Lord. God bless you this evening, this morning rather. Won't [singing] you be [music] my friend? [music] Oh, and while all [music] others [singing] are calling, [music] do not [music] pass me by. Amen. You love the Lord this morning. &gt;&gt; Amen. How many say that the Lord spoke to your heart? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; There's a difference between the message and what a man does with the message. Isn't that the truth? Amen. We have a reality that God has given us in this hour. I'm just so thankful that [music] he's given us a light to navigate the word of God. Amen. That way we can rightly divide [music] the word of truth. Amen. And God has given us a light in this in this end [music] time to be able to do just that. Amen. I I I it's just a sad thought to wander in darkness [music] and look through the scriptures and not not not know what you was reading and not have an understanding, a spiritual understanding. [music] And what a a sad place to be able to be. But I thank God that he's given us a light. And that light that's that's how we discern if we're being led of God or not is by the light of his word. It's not by our feelings and emotions as our brother was speaking. Amen. [music] But God has given us a true discernment of the word of God. Amen. I'm just so thankful for what God is doing for us. And I really enjoyed that message. Enjoyed what [music] brother Andrew had to say. And you know, he was telling that story or telling you about the the the protester. &gt;&gt; [music] &gt;&gt; You know, I I noticed something about uh about that lady whenever we went by is that she [music] was on where she was sitting and I walked by and said, "Why? Why are y'all Why are y'all here?" "Well, it's because I can't be there." That was their answer. So, I come to as close to the border of it as I can so that everybody that walks onto this property, I can tell them not to go on it. I thought, "What a motive." Really, she was a squatter. She [music] was just living in a building that they wanted to do something with and they made her move out of it in order that they could make a museum out of it and she had been living there free for a while and they kicked all them people out and took them somewhere else. But I thought what a thing for a person to do is to sit right on the border &gt;&gt; to keep anybody that would enter in from being able to enter in &gt;&gt; with a clear conscience or a clear mind. Thought isn't that what the devil does? I'm going to get I can't enter in there. So, I'm going to get so close to the border of it as I can so that anybody that would cross across them borders, [music] I could discourage them from entering in. That's exactly what the devil does. Amen. I'm not calling the lady a devil. I don't know her. But I'm just talking about from a spiritual stand. That's what he does is to stop us from entering in. Friends, let me tell you. Let me tell you what that's that's called in the military. It's called an ambush. You don't go there with the intention. you're you're going for a prize or going for a goal and there's something laying in weight that you didn't know was there to catch you off guard or to catch you blindsided. But friends, I don't I don't think that we have to be blindsided by the devil &gt;&gt; because we have a word that shows us that [music] exposes where he is. That's why we listen to the preaching of the word of God where the market opens it. It even it corrects [music] our thoughts. The day you get to a place where God can't correct you, you will never be able to move any further with God. &gt;&gt; You get so spiritual that now you lead God and all the you you you you become the answer. You become the uh the the one that discerns everybody's rights and wrongs. You'll never move any further with God until you go back to that place and say, "I don't know nothing. &gt;&gt; I don't know one thing, and I want God to lead me. &gt;&gt; I don't know what's going on. I want God to lead me by the word of God. I don't I'm not the one that's right. But I'm not the big man. I'm not the big woman. Amen. I'm just a child of God that wants to be led of God and be a help to somebody that's hurting. If you see hurt, get a burden on your heart to help the hurt. That's what a real daughter of God does. &gt;&gt; She sees somebody in trouble. She don't persecute and ridicule and well, look how terrible they are and how how messed they are and why what a mess this is. No. A real daughter of God gets a burden on her heart to go correct and help and and lead and be an example and be a helping hand and lift somebody up. Amen. And they stay the course. They stay in the fight. Amen. That's a true son and true daughter of God. If your children in trouble, Brother David Paul, you wouldn't run from the fight. No. You know what he would do? He'd fight everybody in [music] the way. It wouldn't matter how big or little they were. If that little guy was in trouble, he'd stand out there in the middle of the road, cars coming, wouldn't matter because he has a burden on his heart for his son. [music] And friends, that's what you really need. You need a burden for other people &gt;&gt; and not yourself. No, so selfish. I didn't get this out of it. I'm not getting this. I'm not getting growth. I'm not getting answers. I'm not getting this. We're so selfish &gt;&gt; that we've lost our burden for everybody else. But if you can approach this gospel with a burden on your heart to do something for somebody else, [music] it ain't about you no more. Then God can really use you. &gt;&gt; Brother Brian, is that the truth? &gt;&gt; Brother Tom, is that the truth? Brother David, is that the truth? God bless you, elders. It's the truth that having a burden for other people is the only place that God can ever use you. &gt;&gt; I pray God give us a real burden for one another. &gt;&gt; Amen. They can use us to help one another grow. Amen. [music] We're I believe what brother Andrew said. We're going in a rapture and the devil's doing everything he can to fight us from it. Amen. But I thank God that I'm a part of a work of the Holy Ghost. A small part. I'm not much of it. Amen. I'm the littlest one. Small part, but I thank God that he he allows us to be led by the Holy Spirit. Amen. You love the Lord this morning. &gt;&gt; Amen. We just [music] certainly looking forward to the service this evening with our young people. Amen. just just to see what God has in store. And and I know several of these young men that that God has been dealing with and and we just want to have an opportunity [music] uh tonight that we can just grow and maybe we can have more youth services. We we just had it on our heart to do this uh [music] this evening and to see what the Lord has in store. So we just want to invite everybody uh to come, you elders that can come and be a support. We certainly encourage you uh to do that this evening. Let's just as Brother Brian, would you come and close us in a word of prayer? Most gracious heavenly father, Lord, we come before you, Father. Lord, you fed us, Lord. Lord, you've encouraged us, Lord Jesus, to stand, Lord God, in your word. Lord, your word is our absolute, Lord, and you've given us a place to stand on it, Lord. Father, you called us. You didn't call everyone to this, Lord. And we're so thankful, Lord, that you've given us eyes to see and you've given us ears to hear, Lord. Father, you chasten us, Lord. Father, that we would stay in step with every word that could be spoken, Lord. Lord, these young people, Lord Jesus, as we gather tonight, Lord, Lord, these young people are coming up, Lord God, as Brother Andrew said, how Lord, they've heard more revelation than most theologians because they've been taught the truth of this word, Lord, the importance of this gospel, Lord. Father, without this gospel, how could we understand, Lord? Without your prophet, how could we ever know, Lord, where we stand in you? Lord, I ask you that you would bless these young people, Lord. God, that you would illuminate their mind with a revelation of this word like never before, Lord. Lord, that when the enemy comes in, Lord, they'll be able to stand, Lord. Father, I ask you these things, Lord, [music] be with Brother Andrew and strengthen him for tonight's service, Lord. Lord God, and I pray that you draw all those that you want to be here to be here tonight, Lord. Father God, that we could be found before your table, Lord. Lord, we declare it for young people, Lord. [music] But it's your word unto us all, Lord. But I pray, oh Lord God, that you would bless the young people beyond the boundaries of their heart, Lord. Father, and bless our pastor, Lord, and his and his dear wife, Lord Jesus, as they stand in the gap for this congregation, Lord. Father, I ask you these things in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ. Amen. &gt;&gt; About the [singing and music] Lord, how he saved me, how he [music] raised me, how he filled me with the [singing] Holy Ghost. How he knew [music] me to the uttermost.
