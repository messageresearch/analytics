[33:23] man I won't keep you standing
[33:25] but if we would uh if you would let's
[33:28] turn to Psalms the 29th chapter and the
[33:31] first verse
[33:33] and it's good to see so many out tonight
[33:36] on it it's an old winter
[33:46] night Psalms 29
[33:55] And1
[33:57] give unto the Lord oh ye Mighty give
[34:00] unto the Lord glory and strength give
[34:03] unto the Lord the glory do his name
[34:07] Worship the Lord in the beauty of his
[34:08] Holiness the voice of the Lord is upon
[34:11] the waters the god of Glory
[34:27] breth The Cedars yay the Lord breakthe
[34:29] of
[34:30] Lebanon amen we'll just stop there if
[34:34] you would let just bow our hearts a
[34:35] minute
[34:36] and precious Heavenly Father Lord we
[34:40] just we come in your presence tonight
[34:42] Lord and believe that you're here we can
[34:45] feel you Lord and knowing not just
[34:47] because we feel you but because you
[34:49] promised you'd be here and meet us you
[34:50] said if two or three was gathered in
[34:52] your name you'd be in the midst and Lord
[34:54] it's no cold winter night and I see your
[34:56] your children how it humbles me that
[34:58] they come out to hear the word of God
[35:00] and how important it is that Lord we
[35:02] enter in and just maybe just for a few
[35:04] minutes God you see my insufficiencies
[35:07] as a man and Lord you give me the
[35:09] ability to read so I might read
[35:11] something that was good or but Lord
[35:13] without the Holy Ghost to show up to
[35:15] Quicken the word Lord just so much that
[35:17] we could do but Lord I believe tonight
[35:20] that if one has a need you could speak
[35:22] to their heart however it might be God I
[35:24] pray that you'd do it help me to hum P
[35:27] myself down and just say what you'd have
[35:29] me to say Lord not what I want to say
[35:31] but what the Holy Spirit would have me
[35:33] say tonight and we be careful to give
[35:35] you the praise in Jesus name we ask it
[35:37] amen and amen you can be seated if you'd
[35:47] like man it's a such a privilege to come
[35:51] for a few minutes
[35:55] and look at some things and you know
[35:58] last time I preached here I had preached
[36:01] on a subject of the importance of a
[36:03] voice and I'd made it to a certain point
[36:07] i' talked and not to I'm not going to
[36:09] repr preach it so don't uh get scared
[36:11] but I was talking about for those that
[36:13] wouldn't here how that God promised he
[36:16] would speak through a prophet in the
[36:17] different ways and uh just I really had
[36:20] a good time preaching it and many people
[36:23] come up and had good things to say and
[36:25] said they enjoyed it but I wanted to go
[36:27] just a little bit further because I got
[36:30] to a stopping point and I stopped there
[36:33] and brother Matt got up and he didn't
[36:34] know it but he kind of got on the rest
[36:35] of my sermon he began to talk about the
[36:37] man that you know spoke for him down
[36:39] there on the plane that time and and U
[36:42] it's odd how you kind of catch but
[36:44] anyway I I I kind of want to start I
[36:47] don't I don't want to start over and
[36:48] start repeating myself on but I had read
[36:50] a quote here and I kind of if that's
[36:52] okay I'd like to start there because I
[36:54] think there's many here there wasn't a
[36:55] whole lot here here that night and
[36:57] there's many here that that uh is here
[36:59] tonight that wasn't
[37:00] in and
[37:02] uh I want to speak on them the
[37:05] importance of a voice that it's still
[37:07] important brother Wes that it's
[37:09] important for God to speak but you know
[37:12] what it's important what we say and do
[37:14] amen it's important that we have a voice
[37:17] and and even uh there was a quote I may
[37:19] mentioned it last time I said if I don't
[37:21] if I do I don't mean mean to repeat
[37:23] myself but brother Brandon was preaching
[37:25] and he said there was that I think was
[37:27] in on the phone line and he said you out
[37:29] there he said Say Amen to it he said
[37:31] that way people will know where you
[37:33] stand at amen so uh you know the man
[37:36] they talked about that was uh I believe
[37:37] he was deaf and dumb he went to church
[37:39] one time and they asked him they said
[37:41] how come that you come to church and you
[37:42] can't hear nothing and and you can't
[37:44] speak you can't do nothing but sit there
[37:46] and he said I just want Satan to know
[37:47] which side I'm on so sometimes it's good
[37:50] to start speaking up and let Satan know
[37:52] which side you're on Amen you know you
[37:54] can just get pushed so far in a corner
[37:56] my dad told me there was a man one time
[37:58] that he knew that told him he said that
[38:00] he hadd been going along and Satan
[38:02] started trying to talk to him and you
[38:03] know Satan's got a voice too he can talk
[38:06] amen I just uh take a few minutes and
[38:08] just preach you my heart you just say a
[38:10] prayer for me but anyway he he said that
[38:13] uh this man went along and Satan began
[38:15] to tell him that you know you're
[38:18] blasphemed and you can't get right with
[38:20] God and you did this and you did that
[38:21] and got him all nervous and worked up
[38:23] and got where he couldn't feel the
[38:24] presence of God no more and when he did
[38:28] he said one day he said he got tired of
[38:30] it amen that's where you got to get
[38:31] sometimes you got to get tired of what
[38:33] Satan's telling you in the lies and he's
[38:34] telling if he tells you you can't live
[38:36] right you can't do this you tell him by
[38:39] Jesus Christ he said that all things are
[38:41] possible amen I can do all things
[38:43] through Christ who strengthens me he
[38:45] said one day he got tired of Satan
[38:47] telling him that he said Satan he said I
[38:51] tell you what he said God May cast me
[38:53] out somewhere but he said while I'm here
[38:54] I'm going to live for him and he said
[38:56] all of a sudden he begin to feel the
[38:58] presence of God Amen he got so sick of
[39:01] what Satan was trying to tell him it be
[39:02] good sometimes for us to get sick of
[39:04] Satan telling us amen you can't have
[39:06] healing you can't have this and he
[39:09] begins to talk to you and tell you
[39:10] because you've done a certain thing
[39:12] that's the reason why you're sick and
[39:13] you'll never get rid of it amen that's a
[39:16] lie that's right Amen brother Bram I
[39:18] read a quote here while back brother
[39:19] Bram said even if you done something he
[39:21] said pray and say Lord if I did
[39:23] something to let this come on me you
[39:25] forgive me and I believe God we forgive
[39:27] you for it amen we serve a mighty God
[39:31] that's forgiving and amen his word is
[39:34] true tonight amen so anyway I kind of
[39:38] want talk a little bit about the voice
[39:41] that we have and the things that we say
[39:43] and do it pays to say and do the right
[39:46] things amen as brother Matt was talking
[39:49] that night about that man that that
[39:50] stood up on the plane and he said I know
[39:53] that man he said he was on the last
[39:54] flight and he began to speak up for him
[39:57] amen and even in the even in the
[39:59] congregation brother BR talked about how
[40:01] we ought to stick together you know
[40:02] tight you know and and uh if someone
[40:04] starts trying to inject a little
[40:06] something against somebody amen don't
[40:08] you listen to that amen even if it's
[40:11] true you pray for the person and and and
[40:13] go to them the Bible says if you have an
[40:15] odd against somebody you go to them man
[40:17] it didn't say get on the phone and call
[40:19] everybody you could and spread it around
[40:21] amen but you know sometimes even just in
[40:23] the natural you just uh to speak up for
[40:27] somebody I've seen it I've seen it both
[40:29] ways I've seen someone tell something on
[40:31] somebody and it might not even be true
[40:33] and another person take it and begin to
[40:35] spread that a little bit and tell
[40:37] someone else and pretty soon it becomes
[40:39] so negative everybody kind of gets down
[40:41] on the person amen but I've seen it the
[40:43] other way when somebody stand there and
[40:45] they begin to speak and say wait just a
[40:47] second I think you got the story wrong
[40:49] brother you need to take that you need
[40:51] to find out the rest of the story amen
[40:54] and that that just right there alone can
[40:56] change so much just your voice of that
[40:59] God give you to begin to speak up for
[41:01] someone amen and how it can change
[41:03] things if it would do that in the
[41:05] natural you begin to think about how
[41:07] when you begin to speak God's word amen
[41:10] and sometimes have you ever spoke
[41:11] something just right it seemed like him
[41:13] all the heavens seemed to open up amen
[41:16] have you ever done that amen just speak
[41:18] to somebody and and just speak the right
[41:20] thing and it felt like my you fix to
[41:23] take a Rapture didn't it amen I believe
[41:26] said one time that's Angels Wings beaten
[41:28] together and I believe it pleases God
[41:31] sometimes we say the things that we say
[41:33] man the Sons and Daughters of God Amen I
[41:36] I read this last time I want to read
[41:38] this quote and and uh start here he said
[41:41] this man sitting here with a gray suit
[41:44] on now brother R's Discerning in the
[41:45] prayer
[41:46] line he says forgive me a minute it may
[41:51] not look eloquent but I'm fix to get
[41:53] some room
[41:55] here he said '' this man sitting here
[41:57] with a gray suit on he said he kind of

[42:21] of that old stoop amen sometimes you
[42:24] know what stooping is if if you stoop
[42:26] down to get something you kind of get
[42:28] down low and sometimes that that's just
[42:30] in the natural just you your body get
[42:32] but sometimes we let our spirit get down
[42:34] and get in the stoop a man and we begin
[42:36] to say oh I tell you what nobody cares
[42:38] about me and and this one don't care
[42:40] about me well I tell you if no one else

[48:36] kind of want to take a couple more while
[48:39] I'm on this is you remember Sister Hatty
[48:41] R was sitting there brother
[48:44] brandham it seemed so strange to me that
[48:47] that what she said could have such an
[48:49] impact cuz it seems so small but she was
[48:52] sitting there listening to a prophet I
[48:55] love L to been there that day brother
[48:57] Mark sitting there and listen to the
[48:59] prophet talk about and said them
[49:01] squirrels said I believe brother Brown
[49:03] was saying something like this he said
[49:04] the only thing I can tell you is that
[49:08] the same god Jehovah God that created
[49:10] that Ram in that
[49:13] Thicket said must have he's a Creator
[49:17] and he created those squirrels told
[49:19] Brother BR to speak him into existence
[49:20] brother Wes and a man born in sin on
[49:25] this earth stood there and said let that
[49:27] squirrel come out on that limb and it
[49:29] was something in sister had he right she
[49:31] said that's nothing but the
[49:34] truth buddy I'm telling you there was
[49:36] something beginning to take place there
[49:39] I believe if she would have said I want
[49:41] enough gold to stack Plum up to the roof
[49:43] of my house I Believe it' been right
[49:45] there brother you can call me whatever
[49:47] you want but I believe it whatever she
[49:48] would have said it been there and them
[49:51] boys them young boys laughing and kind
[49:53] of jering and and snickering she said I
[49:55] want the salvation of my two boys and
[49:58] they fell down and give their heart to
[49:59] the Lord am man all because someone was
[50:03] sitting there and said the right
[50:06] thing you remember Sister Weber I I was
[50:10] down she had been told brother bramman
[50:12] went to him and and she said uh she was
[50:14] dying and brother Bram told her said uh
[50:17] told her husband said set your house in
[50:19] order cuz you're going to die and you're
[50:22] going to be left with them young
[50:23] children on your hands your wife's dying
[50:26] well she was sitting there brother Bram
[50:28] call it said she worked down at the
[50:29] government I'm not sure I don't know if
[50:31] she worked at some government offices or
[50:32] what it was hospital or what but
[50:34] wherever she worked she was telling some
[50:37] women that was sitting there she said
[50:39] you know what she
[50:40] said I believe if I could just go down
[50:42] there and he could pray for me one more
[50:44] time that God would heal me and they
[50:47] begin to they begin to talk negative and
[50:50] they said oh there ain't nothing to that
[50:52] stuff anyway said he just and she said
[50:54] now you wait just just a second she said
[50:57] I may be a dying
[50:59] woman but she said I've known Bill
[51:02] brandom since he was brother Brandon but
[51:04] she said I know Bill brandham since for
[51:06] years and she said what he said has come
[51:08] to pass and she said I won't sit here
[51:10] and listen I won SED stand for
[51:13] it Amen brother BR said that the angel
[51:16] come to him and told him he said she'll
[51:19] come in church and she'll be sitting in
[51:21] a certain location by the Travis and he
[51:23] said and you tell her her that I was
[51:26] standing near when she took up for me
[51:29] now was she taking up for brother
[51:30] brandom or was she taking up for
[51:33] God Amen I tell you who she was taken up
[51:36] for she was taken up for both but she
[51:37] was taken up for
[51:39] God when Paul went down there and he was
[51:42] putting Christians to death and that
[51:44] light smoted him down he said I'm Jesus
[51:46] whom thou persecutest he was persecuting
[51:49] the church amen I wouldn't want to start
[51:52] persecuting the people because you start
[51:53] persecuting people you start persecuting

[51:57] Christ amen so she said the right
[52:00] thing Amen brother Joe it's good to say

[52:07] it seems so simple sometimes that it
[52:09] goes way over our head you know we like
[52:11] think of ourself as smart I've never
[52:13] thought of myself as real smart but but
[52:15] we like to think you know we come up
[52:16] with things but it's so simple sometimes
[52:19] it goes over our head just saying and
[52:21] doing the right things amen saying
[52:24] sometimes you know I think like I was
[52:25] telling you earlier a few minutes ago
[52:27] that we ought to get down and sometimes
[52:29] we need to cry out to the Lord and tell
[52:31] him what we have need of you young boys

[52:36] matter if you're the oldest one in the
[52:38] back or the youngest one in the front

[52:42] would pray and I see God do things you
[52:44] know when you ask him humbly amen don't
[52:47] think because I'm just a young boy God
[52:49] ain't going to hear me he hears your
[52:51] prayer amen he hears he knows he God Lov
[52:55] he he likes you children to be obedient
[52:57] to your parents and and and love your
[52:59] parents and and do the right thing and
[53:02] say the right thing and when you pray

[53:10] learned he learned he start had to start
[53:12] somewhere David in the Bible amen and he
[53:14] began to learn Faith he had experience
[53:17] and he began to learn Faith by his
[53:19] experiences amen I challenge you to pray

[53:26] be given

[1:02:39] me later he said when you begin to speak
[1:02:41] that he said it was like you was
[1:02:44] throwing darts at me or something he
[1:02:45] said I can't explain it but he said my
[1:02:47] faith begin to take hold and he said my

[1:02:55] say and do the right things let God take
[1:02:57] control sometimes amen it was war is
[1:03:00] more than me speaking man I don't have
[1:03:03] the ability to speak things like that
[1:03:05] but the Holy Ghost through you
[1:03:08] does Amen I'd rather speak positive if
[1:03:10] you call me and you say brother Dave I'm
[1:03:12] sick I'm probably not you're probably
[1:03:14] not going to get me Cody if you call me

[1:03:31] but we're going to believe what God Said
[1:03:33] Amen there ain't no sense in backing up
[1:03:35] if I don't feel if I don't feel one
[1:03:37] ounce of the Holy Ghost I still have a
[1:03:39] Nazarite vow I'm going to start speaking
[1:03:41] over that
[1:03:45] thing amen I don't you know I've thought
[1:03:48] about our ministers and and I'm it seems
[1:03:51] like I'm the most country and UNC here
[1:03:54] brother Ben was he was kind of laughing
[1:03:56] one night because I made a statement
[1:03:58] about a country statement and I said
[1:04:00] brother that's just no Arkansas language
[1:04:02] you know I guess you never heard that
[1:04:03] out there in
[1:04:04] Arizona and I'm just an old country boy
[1:04:07] but I don't understand much but I do
[1:04:10] understand one thing that Jesus Christ
[1:04:12] is the same yesterday today and forever
[1:04:14] and there ain't no sense in petting
[1:04:16] Devils when when you that's the reason
[1:04:18] why that I may get up here and I may
[1:04:20] spit and I may have to you brother you I
[1:04:22] may have to give you a rag to wipe your
[1:04:23] face off some times if I spit on you I
[1:04:25] may holler and scream and cry a little
[1:04:27] bit but I'm going to tell you I want
[1:04:28] somebody knows a little something about
[1:04:30] God I don't care if he's got eloquent
[1:04:33] speech or what he's got as long as he
[1:04:34] knows a little bit about God Amen I
[1:04:37] don't care if my pastor can he can get
[1:04:39] up here and he might not be able to say
[1:04:40] the words all right furthermore we had a
[1:04:43] propit in this day and some of the words
[1:04:45] he said it was pretty simple he had he
[1:04:47] knew it too he said he even told the
[1:04:49] brother he said brother won't you get up
[1:04:51] there and speak he said because I I'd
[1:04:53] get I'd get up there and say uh um
[1:04:55] instead of uh participate he'd say
[1:04:58] anticipate or something you know and his
[1:05:00] speech was but I'm telling you he knew
[1:05:02] more about God than than all of them put
[1:05:05] together knew about God Amen I tell you
[1:05:08] they've come from all over the world and
[1:05:09] call all over the world to to get to
[1:05:12] where they could he have him just pray
[1:05:13] one time for
[1:05:15] him
[1:05:18] amen
[1:05:19] so we find out that I've talked about
[1:05:23] many different voices but I want to tell
[1:05:26] you another voice that there is brother
[1:05:29] Mike got on it
[1:05:32] Sunday the scripture I believe it's
[1:05:35] Hebrews I believe it's Hebrews
[1:05:38] 24 says that the blood of Christ
[1:05:42] speaketh better
[1:05:45] things now all y'all read it and I won't
[1:05:48] go into a bunch but you all know that
[1:05:51] the blood of Abel Cried Out Abel was
[1:05:53] righteous and and when Cain killed him
[1:05:55] and his blood was on the earth his his
[1:05:57] blood began to cry out amen God knew God
[1:06:00] knew what was going on and that blood
[1:06:03] cried the blood of Jesus cried but it
[1:06:06] didn't just cry
[1:06:07] out but listen it had Redemption amen
[1:06:11] amen it speaketh better things than that
[1:06:13] of the blood of Abel the Bible says it
[1:06:15] speaks better things than the Old
[1:06:18] Testament we find out the Old Testament
[1:06:21] spoke of
[1:06:23] guilt in the New Testament speaks of
[1:06:27] redemption the Old Testament it spoke of
[1:06:29] death New Testament speaks of
[1:06:32] Resurrection amen so the blood of Jesus
[1:06:35] Christ today is here to speak for you
[1:06:38] how many has the baptism of the Holy
[1:06:40] Ghost amen the blood is here listen to
[1:06:43] me the blood speaks by the Holy Ghost
[1:06:47] amen you have the word and the Holy
[1:06:49] Ghost anoints the word amen and it
[1:06:52] begins to speak for you it's speaks
[1:06:54] better things amen if you're down I
[1:06:57] believe today that the blood of Christ
[1:06:58] can can lift you up a little bit amen if
[1:07:01] you're sick a little bit the blood of
[1:07:03] Jesus Christ begins to speak I believe
[1:07:05] it can cause you to get
[1:07:07] well amen I believe it speaks of sorrow
[1:07:10] in the Old Testament in the New
[1:07:11] Testament it begins to speak of life I
[1:07:14] wrote some things down here it speaks of
[1:07:16] Grace yes sir speaks of healing Joy
[1:07:20] speaks of
[1:07:22] power speaks of Heaven
[1:07:24] it speaks of the
[1:07:27] Millennium all the Redemptive blessings
[1:07:31] that the blood was shed for is yours
[1:07:33] tonight amen if we could really get a
[1:07:36] revelation of
[1:07:38] that I believe that we just reach out
[1:07:40] and take it just like if I said you know
[1:07:43] what this knife is yours come get it and
[1:07:45] he came up here and got it I believe
[1:07:48] that that's the way if we would just
[1:07:49] take the mindset that Jesus you promised
[1:07:51] it you promised it to me tonight and I
[1:07:54] take hold of the
[1:07:57] promise amen and let the blood begin to
[1:07:59] speak for you amen you may say see I say
[1:08:04] this because I know the tactics of the
[1:08:06] devil brother BR said to overcome your
[1:08:07] enemy was to know him and all of his
[1:08:10] tricks and I'm going to tell you a
[1:08:12] really good trick that he's got and I
[1:08:15] bet there's some of you gonna be sitting
[1:08:16] there and go man he's talking to me if
[1:08:18] you ever make a mistake Satan don't want
[1:08:21] to ever let you forget it I don't know
[1:08:23] why that keeps coming back but that just
[1:08:25] I I know I know his tricks and I know
[1:08:27] Satan and I know what he does I know
[1:08:29] what he he's done it to me because youve
[1:08:31] done that certain sort of thing I'm
[1:08:33] telling you can't get right you knew
[1:08:35] better than to do it when you done it
[1:08:40] amen the Bible says David talked about
[1:08:43] iniquity and he made it sound like that
[1:08:45] man a man that committed iniquity would
[1:08:46] go down in an instant then he comes
[1:08:48] along and says blessed is the man whom
[1:08:51] God won't even impute
[1:08:52] iniquity
[1:08:54] do you realize that when brother B
[1:08:56] teaches that that on on uh believing and
[1:08:59] disbelieving and on on going too far he
[1:09:02] says that a a Believer can't even go too
[1:09:05] far you can't even blaspheme
[1:09:08] amen if you're really a child of God cuz
[1:09:11] what you want you're not going to say it
[1:09:12] you're not going to say anything to
[1:09:13] blaspheme so Satan begins to he begins
[1:09:16] to hammer at you and he tells you you
[1:09:18] know I tell you if you hadn't done that
[1:09:20] 42 years ago and you remember you done
[1:09:23] this and you done that and because you
[1:09:24] done that and he begins to tell you and
[1:09:26] bring it all up whatever it is you fill
[1:09:28] in the blanks but whatever it is but I
[1:09:31] want you to know tonight that the blood
[1:09:33] is speaking for you and I want you to
[1:09:36] know that the blood of Christ speaks
[1:09:38] louder than what Satan could ever
[1:09:42] speak it don't matter what I say even if
[1:09:45] I said oh tell you what you you couldn't
[1:09:47] get forgiveness sure you wouldn't know
[1:09:49] that it the blood of Jesus Christ speaks
[1:09:51] louder than me amen it's speaking
[1:09:54] forgiveness for you today if you just
[1:09:56] step brother brand on one tape I believe
[1:09:58] is be certain of God he prayed for them
[1:10:00] and he said now you go out of here and
[1:10:02] don't you ever disbelieve it no more you
[1:10:05] have been forgiven this
[1:10:08] morning amen the blood of Jesus Christ
[1:10:10] does not the bible say that it cleanses
[1:10:12] us from all
[1:10:14] unrighteousness amen he that's born of
[1:10:17] God does not commit sin and and it's not
[1:10:20] that uh it's not that we don't have
[1:10:22] failures it's not the mistakes
[1:10:24] it's that sin is unbelief you're not
[1:10:26] going to disbelieve we'll have failures
[1:10:28] brother R said you'll do wrong he said
[1:10:30] you'll willfully do wrong but he said
[1:10:32] get ready you're going to pay for
[1:10:34] it furthermore he says if you think you
[1:10:36] can do it and get by with it he said
[1:10:38] that shows you don't have it to start
[1:10:39] out with so amen if we're I don't know
[1:10:43] where that come from that wasn't even in
[1:10:44] my notes but I I just trying to
[1:10:46] encourage you to let you know I don't
[1:10:48] want to just keep repeating myself but
[1:10:50] the blood of Jesus Christ tonight it's
[1:10:52] going to speak louder
[1:10:54] there's a scripture in
[1:10:57] Isaiah I got to get
[1:11:00] this no weapon that is formed against
[1:11:03] thee shall
[1:11:05] prosper and every tongue now I'm not
[1:11:08] real smart but I know without a tongue a
[1:11:12] tongue is identified with speech so if
[1:11:15] it's got a tongue then there's going to
[1:11:17] be something try to speak against you on
[1:11:19] that
[1:11:22] day let me start over no weapon that is
[1:11:26] formed against thee shall prosper that
[1:11:29] that promise alone right there somebody
[1:11:31] ought to go oh praise the Lord there's
[1:11:33] no weapon going to be formed against me
[1:11:36] ever it's going to prosper
[1:11:39] today and every
[1:11:42] tongue that shall rise against thee in
[1:11:44] judgment Thou shalt

[1:28:56] their feet so but God appreciates it too
[1:28:59] the little things that we do and say and
[1:29:01] I I don't know about you but I want God
[1:29:03] to appreciate what I do amen and I
[1:29:05] believe he does he believe he

[1:29:08] serve the Lord and and what a what an
[1:29:11] encouragement a good word of
[1:29:13] encouragement tonight and that God hears
[1:29:15] what we do and he sees what we do the
[1:29:17] little things that we seem like are just
[1:29:19] just repetitive and you know even coming
[1:29:22] to church on a Wednesday night and and
[1:29:24] just saying amen or just singing a song
[1:29:26] and it seems like we do the same thing
[1:29:28] all the time but God sees it all brother
[1:29:31] BR said there ain't one praise that you
[1:29:33] can let out of these mortal lips that
[1:29:34] God ain't worthy of I believe we have a
[1:29:36] right to praise God every time we come
[1:29:37] in the house of God we worship the Lord
[1:29:40] we sing We Praise Him we praise him on
[1:29:42] the High symbol and on the low symbol on
[1:29:44] the stringed instrument with everything
[1:29:46] that has a voice says praise ye the Lord
[1:29:48] how many say that tonight praise ye the
[1:29:50] Lord amen there I just appreciate the
[1:29:53] blood of Jesus Christ we want to
[1:29:55] remember um our uh brother Joe is is
[1:29:59] going taking the youth to the meeting uh
[1:30:02] leaving on on uh on the Thursday October
[1:30:05] 22nd and we need to know by tomorrow the
[1:30:08] young people that are going to be
[1:30:09] attending uh we have to to pay for the
[1:30:11] reservations to make sure that that
[1:30:13] happens uh so so be sure and let us know
[1:30:16] uh let brother Joe know um so that he
[1:30:19] can uh kind of get all that orchestrated
[1:30:22] and and if you call and tell me I'm not
[1:30:24] will forget to tell brother Joe so it's
[1:30:27] it's October it's in February did I say
[1:30:30] October amen that's bow
[1:30:33] season amen but it's February we're
[1:30:36] going next month so we need to know by
[1:30:38] tomorrow because October is a long long
[1:30:40] way away Brother David said sometimes
[1:30:43] you mean to say uh uh participate and
[1:30:46] you say other things so God bless you I
[1:30:50] knew he was talking about me when he
[1:30:51] when he he was saying that and I
[1:30:53] remember you these girls have picked on
[1:30:55] me since since we first started having
[1:30:56] church cuz one day I said what what kind
[1:30:59] of there's participators and and there's
[1:31:02] all kinds of things and I use the wrong
[1:31:04] word and and I but anyway they've made
[1:31:06] fun of me for for five years over that
[1:31:08] so sometimes we just say the wrong thing
[1:31:11] amen that I I just that's why as a
[1:31:14] preacher you know what you you why you
[1:31:15] want a pull of people can I give you
[1:31:17] this for free tonight before we go you
[1:31:19] love the Lord tonight we just having
[1:31:20] Church anyway we just we're we're out
[1:31:22] here on a Wednesday night but that's why
[1:31:24] a preacher loves a good pull from people
[1:31:26] because a pull from people brings an
[1:31:28] anointing and under an anointing you'll
[1:31:31] say and do things that you don't even
[1:31:32] have the ability to say and do that's
[1:31:35] why you that's why you want an anointing
[1:31:36] in the church and so I I I appreciate I
[1:31:39] appreciate you I appre we wouldn't even
[1:31:40] be able to have church if it wasn't for
[1:31:42] people that wanted to come and have
[1:31:43] church can you imagine having Church by
[1:31:45] yourself I know people do it and I and I
[1:31:47] pray for them I pray the Lord will give
[1:31:49] them people to have fellowship with it's
[1:31:51] a very tough thing but I thank God that
[1:31:52] we have a body of Believers that come
[1:31:54] and they pull from the word of God and
[1:31:56] brother DAV was speaking tonight he said
[1:31:58] that's not even in my notes what causes
[1:32:00] you uh to get to get out of your own uh
[1:32:02] uh character your own own nature and say
[1:32:05] things that minister to people's hearts
[1:32:06] it's a pull from people amen I believe
[1:32:08] that we have a right to pull from the
[1:32:10] word what we have need of that was all
[1:32:11] free but we want to remember that please
