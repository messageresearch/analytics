[28:03] Now you may feel that there's no hope
[28:08] left.
[28:09] Broken hearts they just came in.
[28:14] So you're torn in many pieces
[28:19] that Christ can make you whole again.
[28:24] Now storms of doubt blow all direction.
[28:30] But don't you
[28:32] be afraid.
[28:34] God can make
[28:37] all corrections.

[43:34] And Lord, as your word does, we ask you
[43:36] now to do these things in Jesus name we
[43:38] pray, Lord. And we'll be careful to give
[43:40] you the glory for it in Jesus name.
[43:43] Amen.
[43:44] Amen. How many say amen this morning?
[43:47] Amen. We just love the Lord. And we want
[43:49] to invite you to the scripture to the
[43:52] book of Matthew. And we're going to read
[43:54] out of the first verse, Matthew the
[43:56] first verse. And and uh or excuse me,
[43:59] the 12th chapter and the first verse.
[44:02] So, Matthew 12:1. And give you just an
[44:05] opportunity uh to get there. And
[44:08] I guess brother Ben had announced our
[44:10] youth service next Sunday evening. Uh
[44:13] we're going to do that at five o'clock
[44:14] and uh try to everybody's invited to
[44:18] come. So it's not just for uh there's no
[44:20] age limit on it if you want to uh come
[44:22] and be a support to our uh young people
[44:24] and we're going to try to use the young
[44:26] people uh in in the service. Uh and
[44:30] brother Andrew will be speaking the
[44:31] service. Uh but we want to uh involve
[44:34] the youth the best we can and and uh
[44:36] just something that's been on our heart
[44:38] to do. And so, uh, we don't know how
[44:40] often we'll be able to, but we're going
[44:41] to have a service and see how the Lord
[44:43] leads. Amen. So, just trust that
[44:45] everybody could come and and, uh, be a
[44:47] part of that and support that. So, uh,
[44:50] we just want to take a scripture this
[44:51] morning out of Matthew the 12th chapter.
[44:53] We'll read from the first verse. The
[44:55] Bible says, "At that time Jesus went on
[44:58] the Sabbath day, they threw the corn,
[45:02] and his disciples were hungered, and
[45:04] they began to pluck the ears of corn and
[45:06] to eat. But when the Pharisees saw it,
[45:08] they said unto him, "Behold, thy
[45:11] disciples do that which is not lawful to
[45:14] do upon the Sabbath day." But he said to
[45:16] them, "Have you not read what David did
[45:19] when he was a hungered, and they that
[45:21] were with him, and how he entered into
[45:24] the house of God? And he did eat the
[45:25] shoe bread, which was not lawful for him
[45:28] to eat, neither for them that were with
[45:30] him, but only for the priest. Or have
[45:32] you not read in the law how that on the
[45:35] Sabbath day the priests in the temple
[45:37] profane the Sabbath and are blameless?
[45:40] But I say unto you that in this place is
[45:43] one greater than the temple.
[45:46] But if you had known what this meanth, I
[45:49] will have mercy and not sacrifice, you
[45:51] would not have condemned the guiltless.
[45:54] For the Son of Man is the Lord even of
[45:57] the Sabbath day. And I would like to
[46:00] take that for a title this morning out
[46:02] of this scripture, the Lord of the
[46:04] Sabbath. As you take your seats this
[46:05] morning, the Lord of the Sabbath. Here
[46:09] uh here the Bible is telling us a story
[46:11] or an event uh that came in the time
[46:14] when Jesus was in his earthly ministry.
[46:17] And you'll uh you'll understand that
[46:19] that during this time, it was after the
[46:22] disciples uh had been called to follow
[46:24] Jesus in his ministry. Uh they had sat
[46:27] with him. they had uh they had they had
[46:30] heard the the word. He was preaching and
[46:32] teaching unto them. And and in this time
[46:35] Jesus had started his uh you can call it
[46:38] a missionary work if you want but he had
[46:40] started going from city to city where
[46:42] the disciples were from. So he had
[46:44] called these men together and uh then he
[46:46] started going to their hometowns where
[46:48] they were from to the different cities
[46:49] and the Bible would say he was preaching
[46:51] and teaching uh in those cities and uh
[46:54] and it was all around the the land of
[46:56] Galilee. So here uh surrounding the
[46:58] great sea of Galilee where uh Curasin or
[47:01] uh uh Tiberias, Capernium, all these
[47:04] cities that were surrounding this area
[47:05] and Jesus was working in this area. He
[47:08] was going from place to place
[47:09] ministering going from synagogue to uh
[47:12] to temple wherever he would have an
[47:13] opportunity uh to be able to speak. He
[47:15] was in his earthly ministry. So he was
[47:17] preaching and teaching and uh but but
[47:19] but between the towns they would walk
[47:22] through uh you know from a city to a
[47:24] city. here there would be on the Sea of
[47:26] Galilee were these great fields and
[47:28] grain fields and uh it wasn't corn
[47:30] fields like we would think today when we
[47:32] say corn is a universal word that's used
[47:34] to describe grain but uh for us we call
[47:37] maze corn in the United States we call
[47:39] maize which was a a Native American crop
[47:41] like the the ears of corn but uh but but
[47:44] when they were walking through it wasn't
[47:45] corn like we see but they were going
[47:47] through these grain fields maybe it was
[47:49] wheat or barley uh that these fields
[47:51] that were laying in between Galilee and
[47:53] and and The practice would be when they
[47:55] when they would go along. It would it
[47:57] would almost be eating a snack, you
[47:58] know, they'd go along and and and going
[48:00] through the fields and they'd take an
[48:01] ear off of that and and rub it in their
[48:04] hands like so and rub the husk off of it
[48:06] and then eat the seeds of it and and so
[48:08] they were they were on this journey with
[48:10] Jesus going to another city and they
[48:11] were just walking through a field and uh
[48:13] they got to collecting some of this
[48:15] grain and eating and fellowship. I'd
[48:16] love to been walking with them, wouldn't
[48:18] you? just walking through the field and
[48:20] and and sitting there listening to Jesus
[48:22] talking about the next town or what
[48:24] happened at the town before and and my
[48:26] how many people had received the message
[48:29] that he was preaching and and so it was
[48:31] a great time as they were walking
[48:33] through no doubt just fellowshipping and
[48:35] and as they get to the city there was
[48:37] some Pharisees on the other side of the
[48:39] city that had watched them as they were
[48:40] entering into the city and they watched
[48:42] them go through the field of grain and
[48:44] and the Pharisees they didn't like what
[48:46] they saw because it was on a Sabbath day
[48:47] and They they said, "Well, don't they
[48:49] know that it's against the Hebrew law to
[48:51] harvest on a Sabbath here?" Uh, you
[48:54] know, what a what a evil thing this is
[48:56] that, you know, they're always trying to
[48:57] catch them. And and and and you know,
[48:59] they were right about the law in that
[49:01] the Sabbath had always been around
[49:03] Israel. And so, uh, from the very
[49:05] beginning, you can start in the Genesis
[49:06] the 2 chapter. The Bible tells us that
[49:08] the heavens and earth, uh, were created
[49:11] by God. And when the heavens and earth
[49:12] were finished, the Bible said all uh the
[49:14] host of them on the seventh day, God
[49:16] ended his work which he had made. And he
[49:19] rested on the seventh day from all of
[49:21] his work that he had made. And God
[49:23] blessed the seventh day and he
[49:25] sanctified it because that in it he had
[49:28] rested from all of his work which he had
[49:30] created and made. So this was something
[49:32] that God did. It was a day of rest. And
[49:34] so uh the Israel these these that were
[49:37] holding this uh this law it it came from
[49:40] God in Exodus the 20th chapter you read
[49:42] the ten commandments. This is actually
[49:44] uh what they had been keeping their
[49:46] entire life. So here God takes from what
[49:48] God where he had rested and whenever
[49:50] Moses led the children of Israel out of
[49:53] Egypt and they come to the ten
[49:54] commandments then God gives this as a
[49:56] law he said remember the Sabbath day and
[49:58] keep it holy. How many knows that?
[50:00] That's the fourth commandment. Sixth day
[50:02] shalt thou labor and do all thy work,
[50:04] but the seventh day is the Sabbath of
[50:06] the Lord thy God. And in that shalt thou
[50:08] do no work, for thou nor thy son, nor
[50:11] thy daughter, nor thy man's servant, thy
[50:14] maidservant, nor thy cattle, nor thy
[50:16] stranger that is within thy gates. For
[50:18] in six days the Lord made the heaven and
[50:21] the earth, and the sea, and all that is
[50:23] in them. And he rested on the seventh
[50:25] day. Wherefore the Lord blessed the
[50:27] Sabbath day, and he hallowed it. So here
[50:30] these were the commandments that were
[50:31] given the children of Israel and they
[50:33] had kept them many from their birth.
[50:35] These that were the Pharisees, they had
[50:37] kept this from their birth. They were
[50:39] they had made a a a commitment. They had
[50:41] made a a pledge on their lives to keep
[50:44] the laws of Moses. They uh they they
[50:46] were keeping this to a to a letter and
[50:49] and so uh but but but Paul, he would
[50:51] even speak of this. This was not a a new
[50:53] thing. This was not a foreign thing to
[50:55] Jesus. He he didn't know he didn't not
[50:57] know what was going on. It it was a it
[51:00] was very common practice to keep the
[51:02] Sabbath day. Amen. But when Paul would
[51:03] speak of this in the Hebrews, listen
[51:05] what Paul said. Hebrews the 4th chapter,
[51:07] he said, "For he spake in a certain
[51:09] place of the seventh day on this wise
[51:11] that God rested." Somebody say, "God
[51:13] rested from all of his works." And in
[51:15] this place, again, speaking of the law,
[51:17] if they shall enter into my rest, in
[51:20] other words, Paul is showing us that
[51:21] there's a place to enter into the rest
[51:24] that uh that God offered by giving us a
[51:26] Sabbath. And so he said, "See, he gave
[51:28] the Jews on their way from Egypt to the
[51:30] promised land, he gave them a seventh
[51:32] day for a Sabbath." And Paul said, "See,
[51:34] and therefore it remainth that some must
[51:37] enter in there enter therein and to to
[51:40] they and and to they whom it was first
[51:42] preached." And so you say, "Well, where
[51:44] are they going to enter in?" They're
[51:45] entering into a rest. So Paul said, "And
[51:47] to some they would enter into this place
[51:50] of rest. They would enter into a
[51:51] Sabbath." He said, "And who was it?" It
[51:54] was to those whom it was first preached.
[51:55] So he said God gave them the law and the
[51:58] Sabbath it was the fourth commandment
[52:00] but Paul said but many entered not in
[52:02] because of their unbelief. So so here
[52:05] here that they had made the Sabbath it
[52:07] was such a day and and but but Paul
[52:10] would say but they but once God gave
[52:11] them a Sabbath many didn't enter into
[52:13] their Sabbath. So notice said he's
[52:15] talking about the law how they entered
[52:17] in it but it wasn't mixed with faith. In
[52:20] other words they didn't keep the
[52:21] Sabbath. So they entered into a Sabbath
[52:23] as they knew it as the Sabbath. But when
[52:25] they entered in, they didn't enter in
[52:26] with faith. They kept the Sabbath in a
[52:28] memorial. They kept it. They were even
[52:30] though they were going to a land of a
[52:32] Sabbath, it was an everlasting rest. It
[52:35] was meant to be a land of Sabbath. That
[52:37] what that's what God was telling them
[52:38] that for in the wilderness. It was
[52:40] showing them that they're going to a
[52:42] place of rest that there wouldn't be no
[52:44] more taskmaster. There wouldn't be no
[52:45] more weary. There was no more restless
[52:47] nights. They were on their way to a
[52:49] promised land of rest. It was a land
[52:51] that flowed with milk and honey. Oh my,
[52:53] what a blessed rest. But brother Bam
[52:55] said, "But they failed to get it because
[52:57] when they got there, because of their
[53:00] unbelief here, the Bible said they were
[53:02] turned aside. They were 40 miles from
[53:04] their promised land. They were 40 miles
[53:06] from the land of rest when they left out
[53:08] of Egypt and it took 40 years for them
[53:10] to get there because of their unbelief."
[53:13] He said, "See, God gave him a prophet.
[53:15] He gave him a sign. He gave him a pillar
[53:17] of fire. He showed signs and wonders.
[53:19] and he preached the gospel unto them for
[53:21] one purpose. It was for them to be able
[53:24] to enter into this place of rest. Oh
[53:26] friends, isn't that wonderful that God
[53:28] would give a prophet and a sign and a
[53:30] pillar of fire and he had preached the
[53:32] gospel to you just so that you had a way
[53:34] to enter in to this place of eternal
[53:36] rest. This was the purpose of the pillar
[53:38] of fire. It was to lead them into their
[53:40] rest. It was the purpose of the prophet
[53:42] of God. It was to lead them into their
[53:44] rest. It was the purpose of the
[53:46] preaching of the word. It was to lead
[53:47] them into this place of their rest. But
[53:50] the Bible said but they failed to get it
[53:51] because of their unbelief. He said they
[53:53] walked out and they uh they of the
[53:56] fishes and the loaves and they fell in
[53:57] the wilderness. And the Bible said and
[53:58] their carcasses perished in the
[54:00] wilderness. They never even enter in to
[54:03] that place of their rest. And see here
[54:06] these Jews in the days of Jesus, they
[54:08] had kept that law. They had kept the
[54:10] Sabbath. They were these were those that
[54:12] were the descendants of those that had
[54:14] entered into this place of rest. They
[54:16] they had entered into this land of of
[54:19] rest. That was supposed to be a a place
[54:21] of rest. They were supposed to be a
[54:22] place that was free from toil and labor.
[54:25] And you know the history of Israel, how
[54:27] that they let sin enter in. They let
[54:29] idols enter in. They let other gods
[54:31] enter into that place, that sanctuary of
[54:33] rest. And because they allowed all of
[54:35] those things into that sanctuary, it
[54:37] became a place of war and turmoil again.
[54:40] Although it was supposed to been a place
[54:42] of rest. He said, "See, so, so these
[54:44] were the families that had kept that
[54:46] law, but still yet all these hundreds of
[54:48] years later, thousands of years later,
[54:50] they were still keeping the Sabbath law.
[54:52] They they still kept it according to the
[54:54] scripture." And so and in and here Jesus
[54:56] would say to them, "Have you not read in
[54:59] the law how that on the Sabbath day the
[55:00] priests in the temple profane the
[55:02] Sabbath and are blameless?" He said,
[55:04] "But I say unto you that in this place
[55:07] is one that is greater than the temple."
[55:09] Oh my, they were so good at keeping the
[55:11] law. They were so good at keeping the
[55:12] Sabbath. They were so good at looking
[55:14] down in the field of grain and saying,
[55:16] "Who's this? Who who does he think he is
[55:18] to try to uh to try to h pick corn and
[55:21] harvest on the Sabbath day?" But as
[55:23] Jesus would speak to him, he quoted
[55:25] Hosea the 6th chapter. For I desired
[55:27] mercy and not sacrifice and the
[55:30] knowledge of God more than burnt
[55:32] offerings. I I love this because watch
[55:33] how Jesus Jesus quotes Hosea, which they
[55:36] should have knew as a prophet of God. He
[55:38] quotes Hosea, I desired mercy and not
[55:40] sacrifice and the knowledge of God more
[55:43] than burnt offerings. And then Jesus
[55:44] says to them, "If you knew what that
[55:47] meant, then you wouldn't condemn the
[55:49] guiltless." My here, they had heard the
[55:51] prophet Hosea all of these years. But
[55:54] Jesus would point out to them that you
[55:56] read the word of the prophet and you
[55:57] read the prophecies and you keep the
[55:59] laws, but you don't even know what it
[56:01] means. He said, "For if you knew what it
[56:03] meant, then you wouldn't condemn the
[56:05] guiltless." Oh, friends, let me tell
[56:06] you. Can I just say what it means to us
[56:08] today that God desires to be merciful
[56:11] more than you making a sacrifice to be
[56:13] worthy. Listen what Hosea is laying a
[56:16] foundation of what God the relationship
[56:18] that God wants to have to the church.
[56:20] And Jesus said God desires mercy more
[56:22] than he desires sacrifice. HE HE DESIRES
[56:25] to be merciful unto you. You've made
[56:27] such a law and you've made such a ritual
[56:29] in order that you can serve God and you
[56:31] can be worthy and you can make enough
[56:33] sacrifice that you can be worthy in the
[56:35] sight of God. He said, "But God desires
[56:37] mercy more than God desires sacrifice."
[56:40] He desires mercy. Mercy. He's not
[56:42] looking for us to be a ritualistic
[56:44] believer. He's not looking for church
[56:46] members and and those that can make a
[56:48] way. Oh friends, I know the whole world
[56:50] is trying to earn their way into heaven,
[56:52] but God ain't going to let you earn it.
[56:53] He's not going to let you do anything to
[56:55] deserve it. He's not going to let you do
[56:57] anything to pay for it because God
[56:59] desires mercy more than he desires
[57:01] sacrifice.
[57:03] &gt;&gt; There's too many that follow rituals.
[57:04] But let me tell you what God wants. God
[57:06] wants you to know him. He wants you to
[57:08] know him as he is. Jesus said he he he
[57:11] desires mercy and the knowledge of God
[57:14] more than burnt offerings. Well, that
[57:16] makes me want to preach this morning
[57:17] that God desires the knowledge of God
[57:19] more than burnt offerings. In other
[57:21] words, God wants you to know him as he
[57:24] is. God wants you to know him as a
[57:26] father that owns a cattle on a thousand
[57:28] hills. He don't want you to do it
[57:29] yourself. He wants you to rely upon him
[57:32] and know him as a father. And when you
[57:33] get into trouble, you can say, "Dad, I
[57:35] need your help. I'm in a midst of
[57:37] trouble and I have no way to get out of
[57:38] it." Cuz God desires to be merciful more
[57:41] than he desires sacrifice. He wants you
[57:43] to know him as a father. He wants you to
[57:45] know him as a provider. He wants you,
[57:47] well, you may as well preach with me
[57:48] this morning. He wants you to know him
[57:50] as a healer whenever you're sick. He
[57:52] don't want YOU TO JUST TO HAVE TO go
[57:53] rely on anything that anybody would give
[57:56] you. He wants you to call upon the name
[57:58] of the Lord and say, "God, I need your
[58:00] help. I'm sick in my body. I have
[58:02] nowhere to turn. I need the hand of God
[58:04] in my life." He wants you to know him.
[58:06] He wants you to know him as he is. He
[58:08] wants you to know him as a mother. Isn't
[58:09] that what he told uh told uh Abraham
[58:11] whenever he came to Abram? He was 99
[58:14] years old. And the Bible said when God
[58:15] appeared to him, he said, "I am the
[58:18] Almighty God. Walk before me and be thou
[58:21] perfect." How many knows what that word
[58:22] almighty God meant? It means El Shai. In
[58:25] the Hebrew, it was El Shadai, which mean
[58:28] the breasted God or the all breasted
[58:30] one, the bosom of God, the breast of
[58:32] God. He said that's what God wants. He
[58:34] wants you to come to him. He wants you
[58:36] to know him as a father. He wants you to
[58:38] know him as a healer. He wants you to
[58:40] know him as a savior. He wants you to
[58:42] know him as a mother. The very one that
[58:44] you can grow and draw your strength
[58:46] from. God wants you to know him as he
[58:48] is. Oh friends, don't you realize it's a
[58:50] place that you can come to that a place
[58:53] for healing or or salvation. This is
[58:55] listen this is what he told Abraham El
[58:57] Shadai. You know what it meant? It was a
[58:58] place of healing that you could draw
[59:00] from one place. If if it was salvation
[59:03] you need you could draw it from God. But
[59:05] Abram said and both parts are a part of
[59:07] the new covenant of Jesus Christ. It
[59:09] don't matter what you need. Whether it's
[59:11] salvation of your soul or healing for
[59:13] your body, you can go to the same place
[59:15] to get it. You can draw it from the
[59:17] presence of the Lord. The Bible said he
[59:19] was wounded for your transgressions. He
[59:21] was bruised for your iniquity. See, one
[59:23] place for your soul, the other place for
[59:25] your body, he was wounded for
[59:27] transgression, bruised for iniquity. A
[59:30] and by his stripes you are healed. So
[59:32] he's a healer of your body. He's a
[59:34] savior of your soul. HE SAID, "I AM THE
[59:36] ALMIGHTY. I AM EL SHADAI. WALK BEFORE ME
[59:40] AND BE THOU PERFECT. AND WHEN YOU NEED
[59:42] STRENGTH, I AM THE PLACE THAT you can
[59:43] come to and you can draw your strength
[59:45] from me." But said, it don't matter how
[59:48] you feel or what it looks like tomorrow.
[59:50] Somebody ought to look to God and say,
[59:52] "Lord, I'm drawing from that promise." I
[59:55] wonder how many can say that this
[59:57] morning. Lord, I'm drawing from that
[59:58] promise. It don't matter what you have
[1:00:00] need of. It don't matter if you're in a
[1:00:02] bind or if your family's in trouble or
[1:00:03] if you're or if you're behind on your
[1:00:05] bills or or or if you're sick in your
[1:00:07] body or if you or or if you just need a
[1:00:09] pick to God to pick you up, an
[1:00:11] encouragement. He said, "When you need
[1:00:13] strength, you draw from him. I'm drawing
[1:00:15] from that promise. He wants you to draw.
[1:00:17] You know why he wants you to draw,
[1:00:19] brother Mark? Because God loves mercy
[1:00:21] more than sacrifice. He wants to give to
[1:00:23] you. He wants you to call on him in a
[1:00:25] time of trouble. And brother B said,
[1:00:26] when you start to draw from him, you
[1:00:28] watch how your strength begins to renew,
[1:00:31] how things straighten up, arms begin to
[1:00:33] move out, eyes begin to brighten up, and
[1:00:36] the heart starts to beat normal again
[1:00:38] because you're drawing from the strength
[1:00:40] of El Shadai, the breasted God. I'm
[1:00:43] drawing. I DON'T CARE HOW I FEEL AND
[1:00:45] what I look like. I'm drawing from the
[1:00:47] breast of God. Oh friend, don't you
[1:00:49] realize it was the promise of God. He
[1:00:51] said, "Lord, you promised it. I'm the
[1:00:52] seed of Abraham. I am your child and I'm
[1:00:55] drawing from this promise. It's thus
[1:00:57] sayeth the Lord. I believe you and it
[1:00:59] don't matter what tomorrow holds."
[1:01:01] Brother Brian said, "The next day I may
[1:01:03] be sicker than I ever was, but I wonder
[1:01:05] how many say this this morning, but I'm
[1:01:07] still drawing. I may feel worse than I
[1:01:09] did today, but I'm still drawing. I may
[1:01:11] be more broke tomorrow than I was
[1:01:13] yesterday, but I'm still drawing. I MAY
[1:01:15] BE IN A DARKER HOLE THAN I WAS
[1:01:17] YESTERDAY, BUT I'M STILL DRAWING. I'M
[1:01:19] NOT GOING TO GIVE UP BECAUSE I KNOW GOD
[1:01:21] HAS WHAT I HAVE NEED OF. He said he's
[1:01:24] the same El Shadai tonight. He changes
[1:01:26] not. And his covenant people has the
[1:01:29] same privilege to draw from the same
[1:01:31] resource that father Abraham had to draw
[1:01:33] cuz God swore by the same covenant that
[1:01:36] he would give us the promise.
[1:01:38] Hallelujah. You know what that means,
[1:01:40] brother Mark? that in the promise when
[1:01:42] God promised that Israel would be a
[1:01:44] nation, every time you see Israel in the
[1:01:46] news, it ought to make you shout all
[1:01:48] over this building. When you see the
[1:01:50] nation of Israel or their flag flying or
[1:01:52] see their name in the news, it ought to
[1:01:54] make you shout because the same covenant
[1:01:55] that God made to Abraham that promised
[1:01:58] there would be a nation that would come
[1:02:00] out of his seed. IN THAT SAME COVENANT,
[1:02:03] God promised that the seed of Abraham
[1:02:05] would have access to the God that
[1:02:07] Abraham had. So when you see Israel
[1:02:09] standing there as a nation, it's a
[1:02:11] fulfillment of that covenant that God
[1:02:13] made with Abraham. And if God made a
[1:02:15] nation out of Abraham, then you have
[1:02:17] access to God. For Paul said, "For you
[1:02:20] are the children of God by the faith in
[1:02:22] Christ Jesus." And if you are Christ,
[1:02:24] then you are Abraham's seed and hes
[1:02:27] according to the promise.
[1:02:29] &gt;&gt; So the promise is God made Abraham by
[1:02:32] covenant. Now we're a receiver of it.
[1:02:34] Therefore, I can say that this morning.
[1:02:36] I'm still drawing. If there's a nation
[1:02:38] of Israel, I'm still drawing. I don't
[1:02:41] even if I don't have it, I'm still
[1:02:42] drawing. You know why? Because I have a
[1:02:44] Bible promise that I that that covenant
[1:02:47] BELONGS TO ME. EVERY time I SEE ISRAEL,
[1:02:49] I KNOW THAT SAME GOD THAT MADE THE
[1:02:51] PROMISE TO ABRAHAM. I HAVE ACCESS TO
[1:02:53] THAT GOD. I may not feel him on the
[1:02:55] other end, but I'm still drawing. I MAY
[1:02:57] NOT FEEL NOTHING CHANGING, BUT I'M STILL
[1:02:59] DRAWING. WHY? BECAUSE I HAVE A covenant
[1:03:01] from God. He said, "Whatever you need,
[1:03:03] you draw it from God." You you you draw
[1:03:06] it. You said, "Well, I don't have the
[1:03:07] strength to draw." Can I tell you
[1:03:08] something about it? It don't take
[1:03:10] natural strength to draw from God.
[1:03:13] &gt;&gt; It don't take a natural strength. You
[1:03:14] don't have You don't have to be strong
[1:03:15] in body and strong in mind to draw from
[1:03:18] God. You don't draw by your natural
[1:03:20] ability, but you draw from God by your
[1:03:22] faith. But the Bible said, "Your own
[1:03:24] power of faith has pulled from the
[1:03:27] supernatural God the very desires of
[1:03:30] your heart." That means you have a faith
[1:03:32] that can pull from God that would give
[1:03:34] you the desire of your I don't know
[1:03:36] about you but I'm still drawing. If the
[1:03:38] devil says you ain't getting nothing, I
[1:03:39] say I'm somebody say I'm still drawing.
[1:03:41] I wish brother Homer was here. I'm still
[1:03:43] drawn. I'm still drawing. And the devil
[1:03:45] says you ain't going to get nowhere with
[1:03:46] God. I'M STILL DRAWING. YOU'LL NEVER
[1:03:48] OVERCOME THAT. I'M STILL DRAWING. YOU'LL
[1:03:50] NEVER GET CLOSER. I'M STILL DRAWING. YOU
[1:03:52] YOU'LL NEVER BE DELIVERED. I'M STILL
[1:03:54] DRAWING. YOU'LL NEVER BE HEALED. I'M
[1:03:56] STILL DRAWING. YOU keep drawing from the
[1:04:00] breast of God.
[1:04:01] &gt;&gt; Don't you realize that's why God even
[1:04:02] created us.
[1:04:04] &gt;&gt; He created us because God remember in
[1:04:06] the beginning he was Elohim.
[1:04:09] &gt;&gt; Elohim was the self-existing one. But in
[1:04:13] God was the attributes to be a father
[1:04:15] but there was nobody to be a father to.
[1:04:18] &gt;&gt; In God was the attributes to be a son
[1:04:20] but he had no one to call father. In him
[1:04:23] was the attribute to be a savior but
[1:04:25] nobody was lost. It was the attribute to
[1:04:27] be a healer, but nobody was sick. It was
[1:04:30] the attribute to be a God, but there was
[1:04:32] no one to worship. He was God and God
[1:04:36] alone. Said, but see, all of these
[1:04:38] attributes were in him, but after
[1:04:40] creation, we all of a sudden see these
[1:04:43] attributes being manifested. I think
[1:04:45] this is so powerful. But remember said
[1:04:47] that we are God's attributes displayed.
[1:04:51] Therefore, all of these things that were
[1:04:53] in God before God ever created, he said,
[1:04:55] "And we are God's attributes displayed."
[1:04:57] Therefore, if he was a father and now we
[1:04:59] see it manifested, you sat in here as an
[1:05:02] attribute of God manifested in this age.
[1:05:04] Said, "Remember, if you ever did or you
[1:05:06] ever will have eternal life, you had it
[1:05:09] with him then." See, you had it with
[1:05:10] him. And the Bible proves it. Jesus
[1:05:12] came. Can Can I just say this? Don't you
[1:05:14] How many knows God as a father? How many
[1:05:16] believes that the Bible said he's a
[1:05:17] father? How many believes him as a son
[1:05:19] of God? How many how many believes him
[1:05:21] as a healer? How many how many believes
[1:05:23] him as a savior? See, we've seen God in
[1:05:26] those things. Now, if you know that God
[1:05:28] is a father, how many believes that
[1:05:29] really that God has always had that
[1:05:31] attribute in him? You believe that? See
[1:05:33] that God couldn't manifest that if it
[1:05:35] wasn't always God? It was always a part
[1:05:36] of God, but it wasn't manifested until
[1:05:39] God created us. See, so, so that's
[1:05:42] always been in God. So, here the prophet
[1:05:43] said, "But you're an attribute of God."
[1:05:45] So if you can believe that God is a
[1:05:47] father and that attribute's always been
[1:05:49] in him, then if you're an attribute of
[1:05:51] God, then you have to believe that
[1:05:53] you've always been in him. So see, we've
[1:05:55] always been a part of God. You were you
[1:05:57] were attributes in him. He said, "And we
[1:05:59] never did." He said, "Now remember, if
[1:06:01] you ever did or ever will have eternal
[1:06:03] life, you had it with him then. And the
[1:06:05] Bible proves it because Jesus came." How
[1:06:07] many knows why Jesus came? He said he
[1:06:09] was a redeemer. How many knows what
[1:06:11] redeemer means? Redeemer, it means to
[1:06:13] bring back to an original. It means to
[1:06:15] buy something back, to redeem something
[1:06:17] that was lost or that was taken away.
[1:06:19] It's to bring it back from a place that
[1:06:21] it was fallen or a place that it came
[1:06:24] from. So, how could Jesus be a redeemer
[1:06:26] if we didn't belong to God already? Can
[1:06:29] I just lay that in there? How how could
[1:06:30] he be a redeemer if he wasn't already a
[1:06:33] part of God? But he came as a redeemer
[1:06:35] because you were an attribute of God
[1:06:37] that was lost out here in this world,
[1:06:39] but you came from God. You were a part
[1:06:41] of God. You were in God in the beginning
[1:06:43] before God ever created and now here you
[1:06:46] are in this world and he come as a
[1:06:47] redeemer to buy you back to him. He said
[1:06:50] see redeemment means to bring back and
[1:06:52] you I love this and you the way you look
[1:06:55] and who you are what your name is that
[1:06:58] was God's thinking before the foundation
[1:07:00] of the world. I know well I may as well
[1:07:02] just say it. Everybody's trying to
[1:07:04] change it. Nobody likes the way they
[1:07:05] look. They don't like the name they
[1:07:07] have. They don't like who they are. They
[1:07:09] don't like what what their mom and daddy
[1:07:11] made them. He said, "But the way you
[1:07:12] look and who you are, even what your
[1:07:14] name is, God knew it before the
[1:07:16] foundation of the world. You belong to
[1:07:18] God. God called you. You were in him.
[1:07:21] Jesus came not to save the whole thing."
[1:07:23] He said he wanted to. That was that was
[1:07:26] his nature. But he come to redeem, to
[1:07:28] bring them back. That was in God's
[1:07:30] thoughts in the beginning.
[1:07:32] &gt;&gt; I know what people say when you start
[1:07:34] preaching like this. Well, it looks like
[1:07:36] to me God just is in control of
[1:07:37] everything.
[1:07:39] Well, he is. Amen.
[1:07:41] &gt;&gt; Let me just lay it out there for you. He
[1:07:42] is.
[1:07:44] &gt;&gt; Somebody told me that one time. Well, I
[1:07:46] don't know why if people are
[1:07:47] predestinating all that, well, why would
[1:07:48] I even try? Well, well, I I I read that
[1:07:52] the other way. If everybody's
[1:07:53] predestinated, I thought, thank God I
[1:07:54] saved from the beginning. It made me
[1:07:56] want to serve you more. It wasn't a why
[1:07:57] would I even try? It was Lord, how could
[1:07:59] I wait this long? Why? Well, Lord, why?
[1:08:01] I'M SORRY I WASTED the years, but let me
[1:08:03] serve you if you called me before the
[1:08:05] foundation of the world. I've always
[1:08:07] belonged to you. You sent a word to call
[1:08:08] me out of this world.
[1:08:10] He
[1:08:10] &gt;&gt; said he does control it. He said now he
[1:08:13] could just be he could not just make man
[1:08:15] to fall. See he had all these attributes
[1:08:18] in him. Let me just lay this in here. He
[1:08:21] had all these attributes in him. But God
[1:08:22] is a just God. And he couldn't just make
[1:08:24] by the time he couldn't just make us to
[1:08:25] fall. That wouldn't be a just God. He
[1:08:27] had to put them on an equal basis of
[1:08:29] free moral agency to make his own choice
[1:08:31] but knowing that he would fall. So God
[1:08:34] made you knowing that you can I just say
[1:08:36] that he made them with free moral agency
[1:08:39] knowing you would fall.
[1:08:41] &gt;&gt; God knew you would fall. He knew you'd
[1:08:43] fall. He knew you'd fall. He knew what
[1:08:44] condition you'd be in. He knew the
[1:08:46] mistakes you'd make. He knew he knew
[1:08:48] every every error you'd make. He said,
[1:08:49] "But he made them knowing he would
[1:08:51] fall." He said, "See, but he can't be a
[1:08:53] savior unless something is lost. He
[1:08:55] can't be a healer unless something is
[1:08:57] sick. That things had to be this way.
[1:08:59] God made them thus so that his great
[1:09:02] attributes could be displayed. If there
[1:09:04] wasn't that, he had never have been a
[1:09:05] savior. If you was never lost, he
[1:09:07] couldn't have been a savior. But we know
[1:09:09] who he was. Even that before there was a
[1:09:11] time, he was a savior. He was a savior.
[1:09:13] So there has to be something lost. How's
[1:09:15] it going to be? If he takes it and loses
[1:09:17] it just in order to save it, then that
[1:09:19] isn't justice to his judgment. So he
[1:09:22] couldn't send a man to hell and be just.
[1:09:24] He is kind, gentle, true, honest. He's a
[1:09:27] great judge. So he would be working
[1:09:29] against himself if he put you here and
[1:09:32] made you fall just so that he could save
[1:09:34] you. Said then he couldn't send a man to
[1:09:36] hell because he's the one that made him
[1:09:37] fall. But God actually put us here with
[1:09:39] a free moral agency knowing that we
[1:09:41] would fall. He said he put a man here
[1:09:43] making him on free moral agency so he
[1:09:45] would knowing and and and the man in his
[1:09:48] own image. How could he fall? He said
[1:09:50] now do you see the daylight? See, so
[1:09:52] when God made us, he made us in his own
[1:09:54] image. And we may be in a fallen state,
[1:09:56] but some point in our life, we have
[1:09:59] whenever we find Christ, we come back to
[1:10:01] the image that God made us in. He said,
[1:10:03] see, he made us in his own image. And we
[1:10:05] may go through this life, I got news for
[1:10:07] you, friends. There's some people that
[1:10:08] I've seen, I don't think they are in the
[1:10:10] image of God. I I I've looked at them
[1:10:12] and have my doubts. That can't be that
[1:10:14] can't be the image of God. I I I've
[1:10:16] talked to them a little while that can't
[1:10:18] be the image of God. But but he puts us
[1:10:20] in this life and then one day brings us
[1:10:22] back into that image that he created us
[1:10:25] in. He said any man that belongs to God,
[1:10:28] are you ready for this? He can't fall
[1:10:30] too far because he was made in the image
[1:10:32] of God. He may be in the world. He may
[1:10:34] go into sin. He may make mistakes. He
[1:10:37] may have faults, but he can't go too far
[1:10:39] because you were made in the image of
[1:10:41] God. And any man that belongs to God,
[1:10:43] they can't ever be lost. Well, can you
[1:10:45] hear it, FRIENDS? IF YOU WERE IN GOD IN
[1:10:47] THE BEGINNING, you're an ATTRIBUTE OF
[1:10:49] GOD. HE ALWAYS WAS A FATHER. He's
[1:10:51] manifested himself as a father. He was a
[1:10:54] mother. He manifest as a mother. IF
[1:10:56] YOU'RE AN ATTRIBUTE OF GOD, YOU BELONG
[1:10:58] TO GOD. YOU CAN'T EVER BE LOST. IT DON'T
[1:11:00] MATTER HOW FAR YOU GO OR HOW LOW YOU GO
[1:11:02] OR HOW DEEP IN SIN. YOU FIND YOURSELF
[1:11:05] BECAUSE YOU'RE AN ATTRIBUTE OF GOD. YOU
[1:11:07] WERE MADE IN THE IMAGE of God. And one
[1:11:09] day you will come back to it.
[1:11:11] &gt;&gt; Said, "You can't ever be lost because
[1:11:13] you belong to God." Isn't that what
[1:11:15] Jesus said? All that the father hath
[1:11:18] given me will come
[1:11:20] &gt;&gt; and I will in no wise cast them out.
[1:11:23] Said they will come and they he didn't
[1:11:25] say they might come. He said the father
[1:11:26] give them to me and they will come
[1:11:28] &gt;&gt; because you belong to God.
[1:11:30] &gt;&gt; Jesus said the knowledge of God more
[1:11:33] than offerings. He wants you to know
[1:11:35] him.
[1:11:36] &gt;&gt; But the problem was the Pharisee, they
[1:11:39] didn't know who he was. And Jesus
[1:11:41] answered this way. He said, ' But
[1:11:43] there's one standing here among you
[1:11:45] that's greater than the temple.
[1:11:47] &gt;&gt; For the Son of Man is the Lord even of
[1:11:50] the Sabbath day.
[1:11:52] &gt;&gt; See, it looked like Jesus had broke the
[1:11:55] fourth commandment,
[1:11:57] but really he's actually teaching them
[1:11:59] about the Sabbath. You know, I don't
[1:12:01] think that Jesus done things by
[1:12:02] accident. But here, so you you see
[1:12:05] whenever you read this scripture in
[1:12:07] Matthew the 12th chapter and as you're
[1:12:09] reading it here, it's talking of they're
[1:12:10] going through on the Sabbath day through
[1:12:12] the corn, the disciples, they were
[1:12:13] hungry. They went and plucked the ears
[1:12:15] of corn and to eat. But if you'll notice
[1:12:17] that whenever he whenever Matthew writes
[1:12:19] of this scripture of the 12th chapter,
[1:12:21] when the Bible's written, there actually
[1:12:22] wasn't chapters in the Bible. That was
[1:12:24] something that we added later in order
[1:12:26] to to uh for reference in order to find
[1:12:28] a certain scripture. But when it was
[1:12:30] written, it was written in a letter
[1:12:31] form. So if you'll read this scripture
[1:12:34] at that time when he went on the Sabbath
[1:12:36] day through the corn and his disciples
[1:12:37] were hungry he began to pluck the ears
[1:12:39] of corn. If you'll go back three verses
[1:12:41] into the Matthew the 11th chapter and
[1:12:43] remove the chapter apart from between it
[1:12:45] and just make it the same. Notice what
[1:12:47] Jesus is talking about before he walks
[1:12:49] into this cornfield. Jesus said Matthew
[1:12:51] 11:28, "Come unto me all ye that labor
[1:12:55] and are heavy laden and I will give you
[1:12:57] rest. Take my yoke upon you and learn of
[1:13:00] me for I am meek and lowly in heart and
[1:13:02] you shall find rest unto your souls for
[1:13:05] my yoke is easy and my burden is light.
[1:13:08] So here and then the next word is and at
[1:13:11] that time Jesus went on the Sabbath day
[1:13:13] through the corn and the disciples were
[1:13:15] hungered. So here Jesus is talking about
[1:13:18] rest. Come unto me all ye that are heavy
[1:13:20] laden and I'll give you rest for my yoke
[1:13:22] is easy and my burden is light. At that
[1:13:25] time, Jesus went on the Sabbath day
[1:13:27] through the through the field of corn
[1:13:29] and they begin to take the corn. So you
[1:13:31] you realize the Sabbath is actually
[1:13:33] speaking about rest. But Jesus is
[1:13:35] introducing them to a different kind of
[1:13:37] rest. He know he he knows what what but
[1:13:40] it was a it was a day of rest. It was
[1:13:41] meant to be a day of rest. But but the
[1:13:43] rest that he offered on the Sabbath was
[1:13:45] now being offered in Christ Jesus. So So
[1:13:48] the very thing that they had kept now
[1:13:50] Jesus is offering it. Come unto me and I
[1:13:52] will give you rest.
[1:13:54] &gt;&gt; Wow. What a revelation this is that that
[1:13:56] he's speaking of this. How how many read
[1:13:58] or listened to the Patmas uh uh uh the
[1:14:00] Patmas vision message that brother Bam
[1:14:02] preached. He actually starts in
[1:14:03] Revelations the first chapter and he's
[1:14:05] speaking of the of the of John on the
[1:14:07] aisle of Patmas and he takes out of this
[1:14:09] scripture Revelations 1 and 10 where
[1:14:11] John said, "I was in the spirit on the
[1:14:13] Lord's day and heard behind me a great
[1:14:15] voice." How many's read that? You know
[1:14:17] that John, the entire book of Revelation
[1:14:19] is a two-year period of John uh uh
[1:14:22] writing the visions that he saw. He
[1:14:24] said, "See, I was in the spirit on the
[1:14:26] Lord's day, and I heard behind me a
[1:14:28] great voice." He said, "Here, this verse
[1:14:30] is it causes dissension around the
[1:14:32] world." And it's because that we have
[1:14:34] people that take this scripture and they
[1:14:37] call the Lord's day the Sabbath day.
[1:14:40] Said, see, which to them is a Saturday.
[1:14:41] So John said, "I was in the spirit on
[1:14:43] the Lord's day." There's a whole group
[1:14:45] of of people in the world that take this
[1:14:47] scripture say the Lord's day is the
[1:14:49] Sabbath day. So John was in the spirit
[1:14:51] on Saturday. He was in the spirit on
[1:14:53] this Sabbath day. But brother said, see,
[1:14:55] but first he said they they call it
[1:14:57] Saturday. He said, but then there's
[1:14:58] others who call the Lord's day Sunday or
[1:15:01] the first day of the week. He said, but
[1:15:03] how could it be either of these days or
[1:15:05] even the two put together? For John was
[1:15:07] in the spirit receiving those visions
[1:15:09] for a period of two years. So actually
[1:15:12] what had happened was that John was
[1:15:14] caught up in the spirit and transported
[1:15:17] into the Lord's day which is yet to
[1:15:19] come. The Bible speaks of the day of the
[1:15:21] Lord which is yet to come. It is to be
[1:15:23] in the future. And John was seeing
[1:15:25] things in that future day. So it was not
[1:15:27] I wasn't in the spirit on Saturday. He
[1:15:29] wasn't in the spirit on Sunday but he
[1:15:31] was caught up into the Lord's day which
[1:15:34] was a future day that that that the
[1:15:36] Bible speaks that is coming. He said it
[1:15:38] was a day that was yet to come. It was a
[1:15:39] future day. But in the meantime, he
[1:15:41] said, just to sell your minds, let's
[1:15:43] just find out what the Sabbath day is
[1:15:46] today. Said, see, the Sabbath as we know
[1:15:49] I from the New Testament is not the
[1:15:50] keeping of a certain day. For we have no
[1:15:53] command whatsoever to keep Saturday for
[1:15:55] a Sabbath, nor have we a commandment to
[1:15:57] keep the first day of the week, which is
[1:15:58] Sunday. But here is the truth of it.
[1:16:01] Sabbath means rest. Somebody say rest.
[1:16:03] Sabbath means rest. This is what Paul is
[1:16:05] speaking of in Hebrews the 4th chapter.
[1:16:07] He said, "For if Jesus had given them
[1:16:09] rest or rest day, then would he not
[1:16:12] afterward have spoken of another day,
[1:16:14] there remainth therefore rest or a
[1:16:16] Sabbathkeeping to the people of God." So
[1:16:18] there remainth a way to keep the Sabbath
[1:16:20] to to the people of God. He said, "For
[1:16:22] he that has entered into his rest, he
[1:16:25] also hath ceased from his own works just
[1:16:28] as God did from his." This was Paul's
[1:16:30] teaching. So a man that would enter into
[1:16:33] this rest or this Sabbath, he has ceased
[1:16:36] from his own works just like God did. So
[1:16:38] here, notice we see two things in this
[1:16:40] one. We see this a as a millennium, a pl
[1:16:43] a time of rest. We see this as a future
[1:16:45] day, a coming into this perfect rest.
[1:16:48] But there's another side to it. He said,
[1:16:49] see, brother B said, did you hear the
[1:16:51] key phrase in the last part of the
[1:16:52] verse? He said, God ceased from his own
[1:16:55] works. said, "That's what God gave to
[1:16:57] Israel the seventh day for their Sabbath
[1:16:59] in commemoration of his own work,
[1:17:01] wherein he created the world and all
[1:17:04] that was therein. Then he stopped
[1:17:05] creating. He ceased from his labors and
[1:17:08] then God rested." Said, "Now it was fine
[1:17:10] to give a Sabbath rest to a people
[1:17:13] because they were all in one place at
[1:17:16] the same time. They were going across
[1:17:18] the wilderness. They were all traveling
[1:17:20] together. They were all had the same
[1:17:21] day. Every Sabbath it was the same day.
[1:17:24] every seventh day it was the same day to
[1:17:25] them because they were all together. He
[1:17:27] said, "But how could God do it now and
[1:17:29] it be kept on a certain day because
[1:17:32] today half the world is in a lie and the
[1:17:34] other half is in darkness. So it
[1:17:36] wouldn't work at all. It he said that's
[1:17:38] just an argument from the natural that
[1:17:39] God couldn't have a certain day because
[1:17:41] this is a time of rest that they were
[1:17:43] all resting together just as God
[1:17:45] rested." So here as a body they would
[1:17:47] come to this place of rest just as God
[1:17:49] rested. Well, it's easy when they're
[1:17:51] going across the wilderness. They were
[1:17:52] all together. But how can you tell one
[1:17:54] in America and one in Europe to rest on
[1:17:56] the same day because their day and their
[1:17:58] day is not even the same? It's a
[1:18:00] different day and a different night. So
[1:18:02] it had to be more than that. So but
[1:18:03] that's just the natural. But notice what
[1:18:05] the Bible teaches about it. He said the
[1:18:07] Bible teaches us about this Sabbath
[1:18:09] rest. Paul said for he that is entered
[1:18:12] into his rest. Says see now notice this
[1:18:14] entering in is not only entering in but
[1:18:16] when Paul says entered into his rest
[1:18:19] he's actually speaking of remaining in
[1:18:21] rest. So it's not just a you don't go in
[1:18:24] and out of rest. So it's not he that
[1:18:26] enters in and then today tomorrow he's
[1:18:28] out of the rest and then the next day
[1:18:29] he's back into rest. Next day he's out
[1:18:31] of it. Six days he's out of it. One day
[1:18:33] he's in it six day. But that ain't what
[1:18:34] Paul's talking about at all. He said but
[1:18:36] he that enterth in and remainth at rest.
[1:18:40] So the Sabbath is a place of rest that
[1:18:42] you can remain in. But said not only
[1:18:44] that, he said but it's an eternal rest
[1:18:47] of which the seventh day is only a type
[1:18:49] of. So it's speaking of a rest of an
[1:18:53] eternal. Remember what seven means? It
[1:18:54] means completion. But the eighth day is
[1:18:56] the first day again. He says, see, so
[1:18:58] Jesus's resurrection, it was on the
[1:19:00] first day of the week. It gave us
[1:19:02] eternal life and an eternal Sabbath
[1:19:04] rest. Thus, we see why God could not
[1:19:07] give us any one certain day of the week
[1:19:09] as a Sabbath rest. we've entered into
[1:19:11] and we remain in our true rest which
[1:19:14] Israel could not do because they only
[1:19:16] had a shadow of the true substance which
[1:19:19] we enjoy today. So them going across the
[1:19:22] desert and taking that day and making
[1:19:24] that day a day of rest and making that
[1:19:26] day that holy day or that Sabbath day.
[1:19:28] He said see they that what they done was
[1:19:30] only a shadow of a true substance that
[1:19:33] you and I enjoy. HE SAID AND WHY WOULD
[1:19:35] YOU GO BACK TO A shadow when you have A
[1:19:38] REALITY NOW? WHY WOULD YOU GO BACK TO A
[1:19:41] LAW WHEN YOU HAVE A REALITY? When you
[1:19:43] have an eternal rest, a place to rest in
[1:19:45] the word of God. He said, "How we
[1:19:47] receive this rest or this continuing
[1:19:49] Sabbath?" We receive it at the
[1:19:52] invitation of Jesus.
[1:19:54] &gt;&gt; So you see this is not everybody just
[1:19:56] can't walk into this rest,
[1:19:58] &gt;&gt; but it's invitation only.
[1:20:01] &gt;&gt; Isn't that good, brother Ben? It's
[1:20:02] invitation only.
[1:20:04] &gt;&gt; You The only way you can receive this
[1:20:05] rest is by invitation. You said, "Well,
[1:20:07] where is the invitation?" I read it to
[1:20:09] you. Jesus said, "Come unto me all ye
[1:20:12] that are labor and heavy laden, and I
[1:20:14] will give you rest. Take my yoke upon
[1:20:17] you and learn of me, and you shall find
[1:20:19] rest unto your souls." Said, see, so the
[1:20:22] keeping of the Sabbath is not a day, but
[1:20:24] it's eternal life. It's an eternal
[1:20:26] Sabbath. It's a rest, brother Mark, from
[1:20:29] spiritual toil. It's a rest from a labor
[1:20:32] of sin. But can I just can I just read
[1:20:34] it? But Ram said, "It don't matter how
[1:20:35] long you've been laboring under your
[1:20:36] load of sin. Whether it's been 10 years
[1:20:39] or 30 years or 50 years or longer, you
[1:20:42] come with your tired, weary life, and
[1:20:44] you WILL FIND HIS REST, A TRUE SABBATH,
[1:20:47] AND Jesus will give you rest." OH,
[1:20:49] HALLELUJAH. I WONDER HOW MANY THIS
[1:20:51] MORNING THAT SAY, "I FOUND THAT KIND OF
[1:20:53] A REST." OH, WHAT A REST. I'M NO LONGER
[1:20:56] A SINNER. I'M NO longer lost. I'M NO
[1:20:58] LONGER CAUGHT UH IN CONFUSION, BUT I'VE
[1:21:01] BEEN CALLED OUT OF CONFUSION AND OUT OF
[1:21:03] SIN AND OUT OF UNBELIEF, AND I HAVE
[1:21:05] found rest.
[1:21:06] &gt;&gt; Oh, I love it.
[1:21:08] &gt;&gt; An eternal rest. He said, "Well, what is
[1:21:10] the rest that Jesus will give?" How many
[1:21:13] How many wants to know what that is?
[1:21:14] What is the rest that he'll give us?
[1:21:16] Where he said, "Come unto me. I'll give
[1:21:18] you rest." What is the rest that you
[1:21:19] give? It's Jesus offering a gift of this
[1:21:22] rest. What is the the rest that you
[1:21:24] would give to me? Isaiah said, "For all
[1:21:26] the tables are full of vomit and
[1:21:28] filthiness, so that there is no place
[1:21:31] clean. Whom shall he teach knowledge?
[1:21:33] And whom shall he be made to understand
[1:21:35] doctrine? But them that are weaned from
[1:21:37] the milk and drawn from the breast? For
[1:21:40] precept must be upon precept, precept
[1:21:42] upon precept, line upon line, line upon
[1:21:44] line. Here a little, there a little. For
[1:21:46] with tamaring lips and another tongue
[1:21:49] will he speak to this people." Which
[1:21:51] people? with tammering lips and another
[1:21:53] tongue he will speak to this people.
[1:21:56] Which people is it?
[1:21:58] &gt;&gt; Isaiah said to whom he said this is the
[1:22:02] rest or the Sabbath wherewith you may
[1:22:04] cause the weary to rest or to keep their
[1:22:06] Sabbath and this is the refreshing yet
[1:22:09] they would not hear. Rem said, "See,
[1:22:12] look here. It is prophesied right in
[1:22:13] Isaiah.
[1:22:15] And it took 700 years for this to come
[1:22:18] to pass that God is going to come to a
[1:22:20] people." Said, "The tables are full of
[1:22:22] vomit and filthiness." Look at the the
[1:22:24] whenever Christ came, it was the the the
[1:22:26] synagogues. It was full of of filthiness
[1:22:28] and and and just ritual. The only
[1:22:30] relationship they had with God was
[1:22:32] through a ritual. Oh my, don't get me
[1:22:34] going. But it was just through ritual.
[1:22:35] It it was just following ORDERS. IT WAS
[1:22:38] JUST GOING BECAUSE YOU HAD to go there.
[1:22:39] JUST BE JUST COME TO SUNDAY MORNING CUZ
[1:22:41] I GOT TO GO TO CHURCH on Sunday morning.
[1:22:42] IF I DON'T GO I I if I don't have a hall
[1:22:44] pass, they're going to get on to me and
[1:22:45] they're GOING TO CALL ME AND ASK ME
[1:22:46] WHERE I went and where I was. I got to
[1:22:48] do MY DUTY. I GOT TO SHOW UP TO CHURCH
[1:22:49] ON SUNDAY MORNING. IT WAS JUST A RITUAL
[1:22:51] TO THEM.
[1:22:53] &gt;&gt; But that wasn't a place of rest at all.
[1:22:54] What a lousy way to rest.
[1:22:56] &gt;&gt; Just a risk. Constant pressure, constant
[1:22:59] burden. What a lousy way to serve God.
[1:23:01] What a terrible way to serve God. I got
[1:23:03] to go to church. I got to raise my hand
[1:23:05] or they're going I got to I got to
[1:23:06] worship this morning. I got to praise
[1:23:08] God because everybody's praying. I'M
[1:23:09] WAITING ON THE SON, THE SONG LEADER.
[1:23:10] WHEN HE PRAY, I PRAISE GOD, TOO. WHAT A
[1:23:11] LOUSY WAY TO SERVE GOD.
[1:23:13] &gt;&gt; WHAT A LOUSY WAY TO BE A WORSHIPPER.
[1:23:15] &gt;&gt; WHAT A terrible way to live.
[1:23:19] &gt;&gt; It's terrible.
[1:23:20] &gt;&gt; Lousy.
[1:23:22] &gt;&gt; We weren't called for that.
[1:23:25] &gt;&gt; Said the tables are full. I'm saying it
[1:23:27] nice. Isaiah said the tables are full of
[1:23:29] vomit and filthiness.
[1:23:31] &gt;&gt; What's called the table of the Lord,
[1:23:32] they're full of vomit and filthiness.
[1:23:34] &gt;&gt; The pullpits, it's filled with vomit and
[1:23:36] filthiness. JUST SOME FEEL-GOOD MESSAGE
[1:23:38] to make people everybody FEEL LIKE
[1:23:40] THEY'RE APART. LONG AS THEY GO THROUGH
[1:23:41] THEIR DUTY, they're all GOING TO BE
[1:23:42] SAVED. BUT THAT AIN'T OUR REST.
[1:23:46] &gt;&gt; Who will find this rest?
[1:23:48] &gt;&gt; It's those that have been weaned from
[1:23:50] the milk.
[1:23:51] &gt;&gt; That have found the meat of the word.
[1:23:53] Can I just say it like that? They've
[1:23:54] been weaned. You know what it means to
[1:23:55] be weaned from the milk? You can eat
[1:23:56] solid food.
[1:23:57] &gt;&gt; Those that have been weaned from the
[1:23:59] milk, they're not pacified to go to
[1:24:01] church. They're Well, I'm here. They're
[1:24:04] not just pacified to to to be a
[1:24:06] believer. It ain't we AIN'T WALKING
[1:24:08] AROUND HANDING OUT PACIFIERS TO MAKE
[1:24:09] THEM MAKE THEM FEEL LIKE THEY'RE good or
[1:24:11] or WHEN THEY HAVE A BAD DAY, WE'RE JUST
[1:24:12] STICKING PACIFIERS IN EVERYBODY OUT JUST
[1:24:14] TO SATISFY SO THEY CAN BE A CHURCH
[1:24:16] MEMBER. Nobody wants a church like that.
[1:24:19] &gt;&gt; He said, "But they are those diaper
[1:24:22] division.
[1:24:25] Nobody wants a diaper division church.
[1:24:28] There's a lot of them. We ain't the
[1:24:30] diaper division.
[1:24:32] thumb sucking crybaby diaper division.
[1:24:34] We ain't that.
[1:24:36] We're not that. Said it's those that
[1:24:39] have been weaned from the milk
[1:24:41] &gt;&gt; that can eat on the meat of the word.
[1:24:44] &gt;&gt; Listen what Isaiah is saying. We can eat
[1:24:45] on the meat of the word. That means if
[1:24:47] it hurts, we say amen anyway.
[1:24:49] &gt;&gt; If it steps on our toes, we say amen. We
[1:24:51] don't. We just say amen anyway. Why?
[1:24:54] Because we're weaned from the milk. I
[1:24:55] wonder how many could say that this
[1:24:56] morning. I've been weaned from the milk.
[1:24:58] I CAN HANDLE THE MEAT of the word. Just
[1:25:00] give it to me straight. I can handle the
[1:25:02] meat of the word.
[1:25:04] &gt;&gt; He said, "Line must be upon line, but
[1:25:05] with tamarind lips and another tongue he
[1:25:07] will speak to his people." He said,
[1:25:09] "Then this is the rest wherewith he may
[1:25:12] cause the weary to rest. This is the
[1:25:14] refreshing yet they would not hear."
[1:25:17] &gt;&gt; Isn't that what happened? Jesus was
[1:25:19] walking through the field. Come unto me
[1:25:21] all you that are heavy laden. I'll give
[1:25:22] you rest. If he knew he was out there on
[1:25:24] the Sabbath day while they're a bunch of
[1:25:26] lawb breakakers breaking the Sabbath
[1:25:27] day, he said, "I'm the Lord of the
[1:25:29] Sabbath."
[1:25:31] There's one here among you that's
[1:25:32] greater than your temple.
[1:25:34] &gt;&gt; I'm the Lord of the Sabbath. 700 years
[1:25:37] later at Pentecost, you see this very
[1:25:39] prophecy of Isaiah being fulfilled. But
[1:25:42] remember said they were all filled with
[1:25:43] the Holy Ghost just exactly as it said
[1:25:45] it would be. He said, "Then that is our
[1:25:47] true Sabbath." It was promised in
[1:25:49] Isaiah. It was fulfilled in the book of
[1:25:52] Acts. Can I can I say one more thing?
[1:25:54] And it's still available today.
[1:25:56] &gt;&gt; It was promised in Isaiah. Fulfilled in
[1:25:58] the book of Acts. It's still available
[1:25:59] available to us. But said, "Thus when
[1:26:01] they are filled when they were filled
[1:26:03] with the Holy Ghost, they ceased from
[1:26:05] their worldly works and their worldly
[1:26:07] doings and their evil ways and the
[1:26:09] Hallelujah. And the Holy Ghost took a
[1:26:12] charge of their lives and they entered
[1:26:14] into rest." He said, "There is your rest
[1:26:16] and that is your Sabbath. It is not a
[1:26:19] day. It's not a year, but the eternity
[1:26:21] of being filled with this blessed Holy
[1:26:23] Spirit. It is you ceasing AND GOD DOING.
[1:26:26] IT'S YOU GETTING OUT OF THE WAY AND
[1:26:28] LETTING GOD HAVE HIS WAY IN YOUR LIFE.
[1:26:30] IT'S GOD IN YOU WILLING AND DOING HIS
[1:26:32] GOOD PLEASURE. IT'S SURRENDERING YOUR
[1:26:34] LIFE TO GOD AND BEING FILLED WITH THE
[1:26:36] BAPTISM OF THE HOLY GHOST. THAT'S WHY IT
[1:26:38] AIN'T IN ONE DAY AND OUT THE OTHER.
[1:26:40] THAT'S WHY IT'S AN ETERNAL REST, BROTHER
[1:26:42] WESLEY, because you're entering in to
[1:26:44] the baptism of the Holy GHOST AND THE
[1:26:46] SEAL OF GOD UPON YOUR LIFE. AND THEN YOU
[1:26:48] CAN REST IN THIS LIFE. IT DON'T MATTER
[1:26:50] WHAT COMES MY WAY CUZ GOD HAS IT ALL IN
[1:26:53] CONTROL. IT DON'T MATTER HOW FAR I FALL,
[1:26:55] CUZ GOD HAS IT ALL IN CONTROL. IT DON'T
[1:26:58] MATTER WHERE I FIND MYSELF, GOD HAS IT
[1:27:00] ALL IN CONTROL, FOR I'VE ENTERED INTO AN
[1:27:03] ETERNAL REST. EVEN WHILE I'M IN THIS
[1:27:05] WEAK BODY OF FLESH, I'VE ENTERED INTO MY
[1:27:08] ETERNAL REST.
[1:27:09] OH, don't you hear it this morning? HE
[1:27:11] SAYS, "NOT A day or a year, but it's an
[1:27:14] eternity of being filled with a blessed
[1:27:16] HOLY SPIRIT. FOR THE SON OF MAN IS THE
[1:27:18] LORD OF THE SABBATH.
[1:27:20] &gt;&gt; He's the Lord of the Sabbath. He didn't
[1:27:23] break no Sabbath law. But what he did
[1:27:25] was he introduced us to a true Sabbath,
[1:27:27] which was a true rest and the baptism of
[1:27:30] the Holy Ghost. He was talking about
[1:27:32] something that the Pharisees knew
[1:27:34] nothing about. He didn't abolish rest.
[1:27:37] He didn't do away with rest. He just
[1:27:39] ushered us in to a more perfect Sabbath
[1:27:43] &gt;&gt; than the law could ever offer.
[1:27:46] &gt;&gt; And Paul said, let me tell you what Paul
[1:27:48] said. Hang on that a minute.
[1:27:52] Paul said, "And we who have believed
[1:27:58] enter that rest."
[1:28:01] &gt;&gt; Ain't that wonderful? It's not some
[1:28:03] great big hard door to get through. Paul
[1:28:05] said, "And we who have believed enter in
[1:28:09] to that rest." The very thing Wednesday
[1:28:12] I was talking about the very thing
[1:28:13] that's a stumbling block to the world,
[1:28:15] to the unbeliever, but to the believer,
[1:28:17] it's an open door. It's an entrance into
[1:28:21] an eternal rest. Remember when Noah was
[1:28:23] out building that ark and here it was a
[1:28:26] place of safety and a place of rest or
[1:28:28] you know you know Noah knew there was a
[1:28:30] coming judgment. I'm I'm going to close.
[1:28:33] Noah knew there was a coming judgment
[1:28:35] but you but but but he rested in that
[1:28:37] God had given him a way out of judgment.
[1:28:40] &gt;&gt; So while the world was out doing all the
[1:28:43] world stuff, but Noah was up there. He
[1:28:45] he rested in the promise of God. He just
[1:28:47] took a hammer. You say, "Well, it wasn't
[1:28:48] he laboring." He was resting. He was
[1:28:50] just resting away with that hammer.
[1:28:52] Resting away with those logs. He was
[1:28:54] just resting away because God had given
[1:28:56] him a place of rest. In the time of
[1:28:58] judgment, you have a place of rescue, a
[1:29:00] refuge. And so, he just rested in it.
[1:29:02] But you know that every time that Noah
[1:29:04] had built put another block of wood on
[1:29:06] that ark, the more he built it and the
[1:29:07] greater it became, the less people
[1:29:09] believe Noah, the crazier he became. And
[1:29:11] brother Bam said it became a stumbling
[1:29:13] block to them. the very thing God told
[1:29:15] him to do that would be a refuge that
[1:29:17] would be his place of safety, his place
[1:29:19] of rest, the very thing God told him
[1:29:21] became a stumbling block to the world
[1:29:23] because they saw it as something that
[1:29:24] was absurd to the natural mind. He said,
[1:29:27] "But but but but all but when it came to
[1:29:29] that day when the rain was going to come
[1:29:31] that Noah finally got up and he said,
[1:29:32] "The hour has come that the word that I
[1:29:34] preach is going to be manifested." So he
[1:29:37] stood up and he began to he he he walked
[1:29:39] into the ark and the Bible says and God
[1:29:41] shut the door to the ark. And then the
[1:29:43] rains came and the floods begin to rise
[1:29:45] and people that came beating on the door
[1:29:47] of the ark and tried to get in. He said,
[1:29:49] "But the last chance to be saved was
[1:29:51] already gone because the door of the ark
[1:29:53] was closed."
[1:29:54] &gt;&gt; Said, "See, but Noah, look what he had
[1:29:56] done. He had entered into a place of
[1:29:58] rest." But can I SAY THIS? IT WAS LONG
[1:30:00] BEFORE HE EVER went into an ark that
[1:30:02] Noah had entered his place of rest.
[1:30:05] &gt;&gt; Friends, what the world has done is
[1:30:06] tried to make IT EASY. CAN YOU IMAGINE?
[1:30:08] GOD DIDN'T come in Noah's day and say,
[1:30:10] "All you had to do is say, I believe
[1:30:12] Noah's a prophet," and then you're
[1:30:14] entered into rest. YOU HAD TO GET IN THE
[1:30:16] ARK. YOU COULDN'T JUST SAY, "I BELIEVE
[1:30:17] NOAH. I BELIEVE NOAH. OH, I GOT A
[1:30:19] PICTURE OF NOAH HANGING ON MY WALL, SO
[1:30:21] THEREFORE I'M GOING TO BE SAVED." BUT
[1:30:22] THAT DIDN'T SAVE NOBODY. YOU HAD TO BE
[1:30:24] PREPARED to enter into THE PLACE OF
[1:30:26] REFUGE THAT NOAH WAS ENTERING INTO. And
[1:30:29] brother said, "It's the same thing
[1:30:30] today. The very thing that'll take the
[1:30:32] church out OF THIS WORLD, WHICH IS THE
[1:30:34] Holy Ghost, has become a stumbling block
[1:30:36] to the world." And the more they see it,
[1:30:39] the more they make fun of it, the more
[1:30:40] they persecute it, the more they despise
[1:30:42] it. You let one of these little girls go
[1:30:44] around filled with the Holy Ghost,
[1:30:45] wearing dresses in school, people make
[1:30:47] fun of them and persecute them, but
[1:30:49] they'll still wear them. You know why?
[1:30:50] Because they're filled with the Holy
[1:30:52] Ghost. They've entered into an eternal
[1:30:53] rest. They found a place with God. AND
[1:30:55] THERE AIN'T NOTHING IN THIS WORLD THAT
[1:30:56] COULD CAUSE THEM TO DO ANYTHING
[1:30:58] DIFFERENT. There ain't no persecution.
[1:31:00] There ain't no There ain't no peer
[1:31:01] pressure. THERE AIN'T NOTHING IN THIS
[1:31:02] WORLD THAT COULD change it BECAUSE
[1:31:04] THEY'VE BEEN SEALED IN WITH GOD INTO A
[1:31:06] place of rest. AND THE WORLD HAS NO
[1:31:09] CONTROL OVER THEM BECAUSE THEY'RE
[1:31:10] RESTING in the word of God. They're
[1:31:13] resting in the ark of safety. And I know
[1:31:15] it, friends, but the world looks at it.
[1:31:16] It's a stumbling block to them. Well, I
[1:31:18] it's a stumbling. They don't want
[1:31:20] nothing to do with the Holy Ghost. They
[1:31:21] don't want nothing to do with the spirit
[1:31:23] of God. THEY THEY DON'T WANT NOTHING TO
[1:31:24] DO WITH the move of the spirit. They
[1:31:26] don't LIKE THAT THAT SPEAKING in tongues
[1:31:27] and dancing in the spirit and running up
[1:31:29] and down the aisles AND SHOUTING AND
[1:31:31] THEY DON'T LIKE THAT KIND OF CHURCH.
[1:31:34] &gt;&gt; They don't like that kind of church.
[1:31:36] Said it's a stumbling block to them.
[1:31:37] Said, but the very thing that killed the
[1:31:39] unbelieving world is what saved Noah.
[1:31:41] And it's the same thing today. The thing
[1:31:43] that the world is turning down, it'll
[1:31:46] take the church up because it's the Holy
[1:31:48] Spirit that'll take the church into the
[1:31:50] rapture.
[1:31:51] &gt;&gt; Brother Brian, the world don't want it.
[1:31:53] But you know what? We're resting in it.
[1:31:55] They may not want it. I got news for you
[1:31:57] this morning. Can I say I'm resting in
[1:31:59] it? In other words, as the music players
[1:32:00] come, I'm not worried about my
[1:32:02] salvation.
[1:32:03] &gt;&gt; I don't go to sleep at night worried
[1:32:05] about if I'm going to be lost whenever I
[1:32:06] wake up. I'm not worried about
[1:32:07] salvation. You say you you say that
[1:32:09] arrogant. No, I say that. I say that by
[1:32:11] the blood of Jesus Christ. Not on my own
[1:32:13] merit. I've never done anything to
[1:32:15] deserve it. I know I'm not worthy, but
[1:32:17] I'm not worried about my salvation. I'm
[1:32:19] resting in it. You say, "Why? I'm not
[1:32:21] worried about eternal life." Because God
[1:32:23] didn't call us to worry about it. HE
[1:32:25] CALLED US TO ACCEPT MERCY. He called us
[1:32:28] to accept grace. I I'VE ACCEPTED THE
[1:32:30] SPIRIT OF GOD. AND THEN THEN IT'S THE
[1:32:32] SPIRIT OF GOD IN you that does the work.
[1:32:36] &gt;&gt; That's what'll take you into a rapture.
[1:32:38] &gt;&gt; That's what'll help you overcome the
[1:32:40] pressures of life. That's what'll help
[1:32:42] you whenever you make a mistake. And
[1:32:44] don't don't take me wrong and think that
[1:32:46] a person filled with the Holy Ghost
[1:32:48] can't make a mistake because you can.
[1:32:50] &gt;&gt; They can.
[1:32:52] But they'll make it right real fast.
[1:32:54] &gt;&gt; They won't stay in it because there's
[1:32:56] something on the inside of them says it
[1:32:57] ain't wrong. And if you'll listen to
[1:32:59] that voice instead of the voices that's
[1:33:01] in your ear, then you'll find yourself
[1:33:03] right with God.
[1:33:05] &gt;&gt; Because I'm going to tell you this,
[1:33:06] everything we do said, "Well, it ain't
[1:33:08] going to change salvation. I believe you
[1:33:09] belong to God. You will. You'll always
[1:33:11] be there. But you'll pay for everything
[1:33:13] you do in this life. You'll pay for it.
[1:33:15] It'll it'll cost you. It'll cost you
[1:33:17] testimony. It'll cost you it cost you
[1:33:20] great things in this life. It'll cost
[1:33:22] you.
[1:33:24] Says, "See, but I I'm not worried about
[1:33:27] salvation. Not worried about those cuz
[1:33:30] I've been called into a place of rest."
[1:33:32] I wonder how many of you stand to your
[1:33:33] feet say, "I accept his mercy. I accept
[1:33:37] grace. I accept the spirit of God."
[1:33:39] Friends, can I just tell you this? If
[1:33:40] you're still trying to make it on your
[1:33:41] own merit, can I just tell you what
[1:33:43] Jesus said? He said, "In this place is
[1:33:46] one greater than the temple.
[1:33:48] We ain't going to make it on our own
[1:33:49] merit, but there's one that's greater
[1:33:51] than the temple. There's one that's
[1:33:54] greater than a ritual. And he said he is
[1:33:57] the Lord of the Sabbath.
[1:34:00] He's the authority of the Sabbath. He's
[1:34:03] the the ruler over the Sabbath.
[1:34:06] Friends, let me just say this this
[1:34:08] morning
[1:34:09] as we end this. I believe we should go
[1:34:12] to church on Sunday.
[1:34:14] I believe that the Holy Ghost goes to
[1:34:15] church. We don't skip church to go
[1:34:17] fishing and hunting and working. Brother
[1:34:19] Bam said it was a sin to skip church to
[1:34:20] go fishing and working and hunting. He
[1:34:22] said I believe it's a sin to do that.
[1:34:24] Said we go to church because we're
[1:34:25] worshippers. Now if you're you know he
[1:34:28] makes a in in question answers makes a
[1:34:30] statement well if people's out somewhere
[1:34:31] and in the wilderness or whatever
[1:34:33] hunting there ain't a church to go to.
[1:34:34] Well that well then then I understand
[1:34:36] you go fishing on there. He said because
[1:34:38] you're out there doing it there. There
[1:34:39] ain't nothing wrong with that. But if
[1:34:40] you would skip church to go do it. Maybe
[1:34:43] your oxy in the ditch and you have to go
[1:34:44] work and you can't go to church so you
[1:34:46] have to work. That's one thing. But if
[1:34:47] you skip church to work, well, I'll just
[1:34:49] do it on Sunday so I can play basketball
[1:34:51] today. I'll just put that off to Sunday.
[1:34:53] I'll work Sunday. So, see, well then
[1:34:56] you're you're not you're not obeying the
[1:34:57] Lord. Said, but we come to church and we
[1:35:00] we go to church because we're
[1:35:01] worshippers. We come to worship. We come
[1:35:04] to feed on the word and we come to have
[1:35:08] fellowship with God and fellowship
[1:35:10] around the word of God. Isn't that
[1:35:11] right? That's what Paul said. He said,
[1:35:13] "Come unto me all you that are heavy
[1:35:16] laden and I will give you rest." Or or
[1:35:19] or Paul, he said he said, "Forsake not
[1:35:22] assembling yourselves together as a
[1:35:23] manner of some is, but exhort one
[1:35:25] another and so much more as you see that
[1:35:26] day approach." It means to come and
[1:35:29] encourage one another.
[1:35:31] &gt;&gt; So, we come to church, we assemble
[1:35:32] ourselves, we encourage one another in
[1:35:34] the word of God. And although this
[1:35:37] Sunday is a type of the Sabbath, Brother
[1:35:39] Wesley, it's not our true Sabbath.
[1:35:42] That true Sabbath that we live in, we
[1:35:45] ought to enter into it every day of the
[1:35:47] week. It ought to be a place that we
[1:35:49] live and a place that we dwell. Said the
[1:35:52] Holy Ghost is the rest, not Sunday. That
[1:35:54] ain't the rest day. The Holy Spirit is
[1:35:56] the rest day. Sabbath means rest. And
[1:35:58] this is the rest to the soul. You have
[1:36:01] an eternal rest. My isn't that
[1:36:03] wonderful? A rest from your burdens.
[1:36:07] &gt;&gt; That's what Jesus offered us. A rest
[1:36:08] from our burdens. You realize that you
[1:36:11] was born with a burden. You were born
[1:36:12] with a yoke of sin upon you when you was
[1:36:16] born in this life, brother Ben. And you
[1:36:18] know what? You went through this whole
[1:36:19] life just dragging that old yoke around.
[1:36:22] Can you imagine born with that? You know
[1:36:24] how ox they put that yolk on them to to
[1:36:26] drag a wagon around. You imagine we're
[1:36:28] born with that old yoke just dragging
[1:36:30] around our whole life with that yoke of
[1:36:32] sin on us. You said, "Let me tell you
[1:36:34] why the people of God, they they they
[1:36:36] get so free in the house of God whenever
[1:36:38] they find Jesus is because whenever you
[1:36:40] find Jesus, he said, "Your yoke is easy
[1:36:42] and your burden is light."
[1:36:44] &gt;&gt; He said, "PUT YOUR YOKE UPON ME. CAST
[1:36:46] YOUR BURDEN UPON ME AND I'LL GIVE YOU
[1:36:48] REST." NO WONDER THEY SHOUT IN THE HOUSE
[1:36:50] OF GOD. NO WONDER THERE'S FREEDOM IN THE
[1:36:52] HOUSE OF GOD. NO WONDER THEY WORSHIP GOD
[1:36:54] LIKE THEY DO. CUZ I KNOW WHAT IT WAS
[1:36:56] LIKE TO CARRY AN OLD BURDEN AND A YOKE
[1:36:59] OF SIN UNTIL I MET THE ONE THAT I COULD
[1:37:01] CAST MY BURDEN UPON. AND NOW MY BURDEN
[1:37:04] IS LIGHT. THEREFORE, I'M FREE. AND WHO
[1:37:06] THE SON HAS SET FREE IS FREE INDEED.
[1:37:09] THAT'S WHY I SHOUT. THAT'S WHY I PRAISE
[1:37:11] GOD. THAT'S WHY I WORSHIP THE WAY I DO.
[1:37:13] THAT'S WHY I DEDICATE MY TIME TO THE
[1:37:15] LORD.
[1:37:16] &gt;&gt; I GIVE BACK TO HIM BECAUSE HE MADE MY
[1:37:18] BURDEN EASY.
[1:37:20] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH.
[1:37:21] He gave me an eternal rest,
[1:37:24] &gt;&gt; a place of rest.
[1:37:25] &gt;&gt; I can't be lost. You can try to send me
[1:37:28] to hell if you want to, but Jesus done
[1:37:30] made a way. You can you can you CAN TRY
[1:37:32] TO TO TRY TO TO BRING ME DOWN IF YOU
[1:37:34] WANT TO, BUT HE DONE PAVED THE WAY.
[1:37:38] &gt;&gt; Sin can't take you. The devil can't take
[1:37:40] you.
[1:37:42] &gt;&gt; Lies can't take you. YOUR PAST CAN'T
[1:37:45] take you.
[1:37:47] It has no authority
[1:37:49] &gt;&gt; because Jesus said, "I am the Lord of
[1:37:51] the Sabbath." Devil ain't got no say in
[1:37:54] it at all. My Isn't it wonderful?
[1:37:57] &gt;&gt; Say, "I my burden's gone." How many lift
[1:37:59] their hand? Say, "My burden's gone." If
[1:38:01] you if it isn't gone, friends, let me
[1:38:04] invite you this morning. Can I give you
[1:38:05] the invitation that Jesus made? Come
[1:38:08] unto me, all of you that are heavy
[1:38:10] laden, and I'll give you rest. Won't you
[1:38:14] bow your heads this morning?
[1:38:17] Maybe you come here looking for that
[1:38:20] heavy laden, but I'll give you rest. God
[1:38:24] bless you, sis. God bless you, brother.
[1:38:26] Say, "Brother man, I pray you remember
[1:38:27] me this morning. I'd like to lay these
[1:38:30] burdens." God bless your hands all over
[1:38:33] the building. I'd like to lay these
[1:38:34] burdens. If God has given us a place of
[1:38:37] rest, I don't want to carry that no
[1:38:39] more. Every yoke, every burden, I don't
[1:38:42] want to carry that. But he's given us a
[1:38:44] place to lay it down. Let's just pray.
[1:38:48] Gracious heavenly father,
[1:38:51] Lord, what a tremendous gift that you've
[1:38:55] given us, Lord.
[1:38:57] Lord, a place to lay our burdens down,
[1:39:02] God, that we would no longer carry this
[1:39:06] yoke, Lord, that's the devil would put
[1:39:08] on the children of God, Lord. It just
[1:39:11] seems like it's such an age of pressure
[1:39:12] and
[1:39:14] just a just a terrible
[1:39:17] age, Lord, and God, great pressures and
[1:39:22] Lord. But we just ask you, Lord, this
[1:39:24] morning, Lord, that you would come to
[1:39:26] each one of these, Lord. Here, our hands
[1:39:28] are raised, God. I pray, Lord, that they
[1:39:31] would do just what the scripture said.
[1:39:34] Lord, that by lifting of their hands and
[1:39:36] surrendering, Lord, may they surrender
[1:39:39] the yoke that they're carrying. Lord,
[1:39:41] may you take it upon yourself, Lord, as
[1:39:43] you gave us an invitation. Come unto me
[1:39:45] all you that are heavy laden. Lord, I
[1:39:48] just pray, Lord, that you would take it
[1:39:49] and give back a rest. Lord, take the
[1:39:52] burden and return it with a rest. Lord,
[1:39:56] I just ask you this morning, Lord, you'd
[1:39:58] give a refilling to every one of those,
[1:40:00] Lord. God, a refreshing in the presence
[1:40:03] of God, a refilling of the baptism of
[1:40:05] the Holy Ghost. God, restore our zeal,
[1:40:07] Lord, this morning. God, make our burden
[1:40:10] light.
[1:40:12] We thank you for it now. In the name of
[1:40:14] Jesus Christ, we pray. Amen.
[1:40:18] Thank you, Lord Jesus.
[1:40:22] Amen. Isn't he wonderful
[1:40:24] &gt;&gt; this morning? Well, you could lock me up
[1:40:29] in a prison
[1:40:33] and throw
[1:40:36] away
[1:40:38] the key.
[1:40:42] You could take
[1:40:44] away
[1:40:46] my vision
[1:40:49] that these eyes
[1:40:52] that now I see.
[1:40:57] for you can deprive
[1:41:00] me of
[1:41:02] the food that I eat
[1:41:06] and even
[1:41:09] by
[1:41:10] my hands
[1:41:12] and feet.
[1:41:14] But as long
[1:41:16] as I
[1:41:18] know Jesus,
[1:41:22] I know that I can still
[1:41:26] go free.
[1:41:31] That I
[1:41:33] can still
[1:41:35] go free.
[1:41:38] Tell me what kind of man
[1:41:43] would reach down his hand.
[1:42:05] He put my name in his
[1:42:22] I stand
[1:42:26] like a king
[1:42:28] to defeat
[1:42:30] his throne.
[1:42:35] Take
[1:42:37] the road
[1:42:45] of flesh
[1:42:47] and boneless
[1:43:01] to calary.
[1:43:07] The blood
[1:43:10] shed on my heart
[1:43:15] that I
[1:43:17] could still
[1:43:19] go free.
[1:43:24] &gt;&gt; That I
[1:43:25] could still
[1:43:28] go free.
[1:43:32] A kind
[1:43:34] of man
[1:43:36] reach out his hand
[1:43:40] and do this for me.
[1:43:46] Unworthy
[1:43:48] to live,
[1:43:50] &gt;&gt; not
[1:43:52] to kill
[1:43:55] on the cross. He my name in his will.
[1:44:02] and said that
[1:44:03] &gt;&gt; I could still go
[1:44:17] &gt;&gt; stand
[1:44:19] a king
[1:44:23] his throne
[1:44:26] to take home.
[1:44:31] and worth
[1:44:35] feel.
[1:44:43] And later on down
[1:44:48] that holy
[1:44:50] path
[1:44:54] to Calary.
[1:44:59] Oh, the blood
[1:45:02] shed
[1:45:04] my pardon.
[1:45:10] I could still
[1:45:12] go free.
[1:45:15] &gt;&gt; Oh,
[1:45:17] I
[1:45:18] can still
[1:45:20] go free.
[1:45:23] Oh, tell me what kind
[1:45:27] of man
[1:45:29] would reach down his hand
[1:45:33] and do this for me.
[1:45:38] I'm so unworthy
[1:45:41] to live
[1:45:43] and not fit to kill, but a man on the
[1:45:50] cross
[1:45:51] for my name came in his will and said
[1:45:56] that I could still
[1:45:59] go free.
[1:46:03] Oh well, I never could quite
[1:46:08] understand
[1:46:10] this one thing. Tell me why a king would
[1:46:14] want to leave
[1:46:16] his throne.
[1:46:20] Just to put on
[1:46:23] the robe
[1:46:25] of an earthly man
[1:46:28] and to feel the pain
[1:46:31] of common flesh
[1:46:33] and bone.
[1:46:35] Listen what he did now. or to later
[1:46:39] walk down
[1:46:42] that lonely
[1:46:44] path.
[1:46:46] They led
[1:46:48] to dark calary.
[1:46:54] with all the blood that he shed. It's
[1:46:58] time I pardon
[1:47:02] and said that I could still
[1:47:06] go free.
[1:47:09] I say that I
[1:47:13] can still
[1:47:15] go free.
[1:47:19] Tell me what kind
[1:47:21] of man
[1:47:23] would reach down his hand
[1:47:27] and do this for me.
[1:47:33] So unworthy
[1:47:35] to live
[1:47:37] yet not fear to kill.
[1:47:41] put a man on the cross. He put my name
[1:47:47] in his will and said that I can still
[1:47:54] go free. Can I sing this verse one more
[1:47:56] time? Oh, I never could quiet. What a
[1:48:01] thing it is. Understand this one thing.
[1:48:06] Tell me why a king would want to leave
[1:48:10] his throne.
[1:48:14] Just to put on
[1:48:17] the robe
[1:48:19] of an earthly
[1:48:21] man
[1:48:23] and feel the pain of common flesh and
[1:48:28] bone.
[1:48:31] more than to later walk down
[1:48:36] that lonely
[1:48:38] path
[1:48:40] that leads
[1:48:42] to dark Calary.
[1:48:47] Oh, but those blood red stains,
[1:48:52] they broke all of my chains. And I know
[1:48:56] I I can still go free,
[1:49:02] but I say that I
[1:49:06] can still go free.
[1:49:11] Oh, tell me what kind of man
[1:49:16] &gt;&gt; reach down his hand
[1:49:20] and do this for me.
[1:49:25] I'm so unworthy
[1:49:28] to live
[1:49:30] yet not fit to kill. But then a man on
[1:49:36] the cross, he wrote my name in his will
[1:49:42] and said that I can still
[1:49:46] go free.
[1:49:53] Amen. How many's free this morning? I
[1:49:55] said, how many's free this morning? How
[1:49:57] many's found a place of rest? Amen. What
[1:50:00] a eternal rest. Amen. Isn't it
[1:50:04] wonderful? We don't have to worry about
[1:50:06] tomorrow cuz I found my rest. Brother
[1:50:09] Roy, it's it's it's wonderful.
[1:50:13] Many years ago, you've been serving the
[1:50:15] Lord. How many how many years you've
[1:50:17] been serving God?
[1:50:22] 50 years. 50 plus years
[1:50:25] he found rest 50 years ago.
[1:50:29] I pray that's my testimony.
[1:50:31] 50 years ago I found a place of rest and
[1:50:34] it's kept me through trials and problems
[1:50:37] and persecution and all kinds of things
[1:50:41] that we all go through but it's kept you
[1:50:43] 50 years. Him and Sister Judy sat here
[1:50:46] elders in the church kept them all this
[1:50:47] time. Oh listen young people. If it can
[1:50:51] keep them 50 years, I got news for you,
[1:50:53] it can keep you 50 years.
[1:50:56] &gt;&gt; And not only will it keep them 50, you
[1:50:57] know, say it doesn't matter how many
[1:50:59] years it is, by the way, because it's an
[1:51:01] eternal rest.
[1:51:03] &gt;&gt; So no matter how long we go in this
[1:51:04] life, it's an eternal rest. And that
[1:51:06] same thing that's kept them for 50 years
[1:51:08] is the same thing that one day they'll
[1:51:10] be walking just like this and take one
[1:51:12] more step right out of this dimension
[1:51:14] into another dimension because it's a
[1:51:16] place of rest.
[1:51:18] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Isn't he wonderful this
[1:51:21] morning? You love the Lord. Brother
[1:51:23] Brian, would you come? Amen. Appreciate
[1:51:26] Brother Brian. And he's going to be
[1:51:29] preaching for us for long. Amen. We sure
[1:51:32] appreciate his ministry. He's been a big
[1:51:34] big help to the church. And Amen. God
[1:51:37] bless you. But
[1:51:40] our hearts,
[1:51:46] Lord, what words could we say to you,
[1:51:48] Lord?
[1:51:51] Lord, but that we love you, Lord.
[1:51:55] Lord, and you sent your precious word
[1:51:57] unto us, Lord.
[1:52:00] Lord, what more can we say,
[1:52:05] Lord, you pulled us into your rest,
[1:52:07] Lord. Lord, you come seeking after us,
[1:52:10] Lord, and you found us, Lord, right

[1:52:25] all that you are, Lord. Lord, that we
[1:52:28] manifest all that you are, Lord. Lord,
[1:52:31] that we have love one for another, Lord.
[1:52:35] Lord God, if there's anything, Lord God,
[1:52:37] that's that's driven a wedge between us,
[1:52:40] Lord, dissolve it today, Lord, that we
[1:52:43] could we could lift up your name with
[1:52:46] holy lips, Lord, with holy hands, Lord,
[1:52:49] that we could truly say we have love one
[1:52:52] for another, Lord. Lord Jesus, I ask
[1:52:56] you, Lord, Lord, that you would bless
[1:52:58] our pastor, Lord, and strengthen him,
[1:53:00] Lord Jesus, for the work before him,

[1:54:06] that we could be reminded of your
[1:54:08] sacrifice, Lord. Lord, the pain you felt
[1:54:12] for us, Lord, that we would have life
[1:54:14] and have it more abundantly, Lord. Lord,

[1:54:21] would bless these precious people, Lord,
[1:54:23] more than they could ever contain, Lord.
[1:54:26] Lord, I ask it in your precious name,
[1:54:28] Jesus. Amen.
[1:54:33] &gt;&gt; Amen. God bless you. Remember our

[1:54:36] be back home preaching for us Wednesday
[1:54:38] night. So, God bless you as you go.
[1:54:41] Well, as I travel through this sink,
[1:54:45] there is a friend who watches me
[1:54:53] through this sink and sand. It is the
[1:54:56] cross of Calary.
[1:55:01] This will be my prayer, dear Lord, each
[1:55:04] day. Help me do the bless I can.
[1:55:09] Oh, I need thy life to guide me day and
[1:55:13] night. Blessed Jesus, hold my hand.
[1:55:19] Jesus,
[1:55:21] hold my hand.
[1:55:23] Lord, I need thee every hour.
[1:55:28] And through this sinking sand,
[1:55:32] won't you protect me by thy saving
[1:55:37] power? And this will be my prayer
[1:55:40] deliver.
[1:55:42] Oh Lord, look down, look down on down.
[1:55:46] Oh, when I kneel in prayer, I hope to
[1:55:50] meet you there. Blessed Jesus, hold my
[1:55:54] hand.
[1:55:57] Make me travel in the light divine that
[1:56:01] I may see the blessed day.
[1:56:06] Keep me there.
[1:56:07] &gt;&gt; I may be holy thine and sing redemption
[1:56:12] song someday.
[1:56:15] I will be a soldier brave and true ever
[1:56:20] firmly. I'm going to take my stand.
[1:56:24] And as I go and me blessed Jesus, won't
[1:56:30] you hold my hand?
[1:56:33] But I said, "Jesus,
[1:56:35] &gt;&gt; hold my hand.
[1:56:38] Lord, I need you every hour
[1:56:43] through this land sinking sand.
[1:56:47] Won't you protect me by thy saving
[1:56:51] power? This will be my prayer.
[1:56:56] Oh Lord,
[1:56:58] look down on me.
[1:57:01] When I kneel in prayer, I hope to meet
[1:57:04] you there. Blessed Jesus, hold my hand.
