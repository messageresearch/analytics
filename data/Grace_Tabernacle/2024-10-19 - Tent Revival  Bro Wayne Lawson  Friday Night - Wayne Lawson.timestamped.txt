[59:12] invited him amen I certainly want to
[59:15] believe we want to make him welcome
[59:17] tonight amen giving him a place and we
[59:20] know uh it was in the scriptures when
[59:23] they invited him the Bible said
[59:26] they invited him but they Dev washed his
[59:29] feet many people think that's just that
[59:33] uh the Pharisees didn't take out about a
[59:36] a p of water and wash his feet but that
[59:38] really wasn't what that was about what
[59:41] that was about was that they had put in
[59:43] in their religious circles that Jesus
[59:45] was a dirty
[59:47] thing and that he was a be elab above
[59:50] because of his prophetic gift and what
[59:52] he was able to do and the healing and
[59:55] the forgiving of sins and they had just
[59:57] about convinced everyone that Jesus was
[1:00:00] someone to be avoided he was someone to
[1:00:02] be laughed at someone to be made fun of
[1:00:06] but there was one little woman ruined it
[1:00:08] all and she come in the room and she
[1:00:11] began to wash his feet and she began to
[1:00:13] say that this is the spirit of God this
[1:00:17] is him this is right and see tonight we
[1:00:20] thank the Lord that when we invite him
[1:00:22] and then he comes in in great power we
[1:00:24] don't run from it and well that's uh
[1:00:27] from the wrong Spirit but yet we worship
[1:00:29] Him and we invite him amen it's much
[1:00:31] like when he visited the tent of Abraham
[1:00:33] when he came there remember in the
[1:00:34] scriptures and Abraham was sitting in
[1:00:37] the door of the tent when the Lord came
[1:00:38] unto him and when he came he told Sarah
[1:00:41] said go go kill some a calf and bring
[1:00:45] the meat and get a pel of water some
[1:00:47] milk and and we'll make these folks
[1:00:49] welcome and I tell you tonight I believe
[1:00:51] that you can entertain the presence of
[1:00:52] God you can make him welcome when he
[1:00:55] begins to move you can just Reach Out
[1:00:57] amen and get a hold of him I believe
[1:00:59] you're his children tonight amen how
[1:01:01] many how many of his children do we have
[1:01:02] here tonight do you know that he would
[1:01:05] come in this tent for just
[1:01:07] one but here tonight you've all gathered
[1:01:10] together knowing that he would come to
[1:01:12] meet the need and knowing what kind of
[1:01:14] God he is there is nothing that is
[1:01:16] impossible there's nothing out of his
[1:01:18] reach tonight and so when he comes by
[1:01:21] your way now don't you just sit there
[1:01:24] and say well that's just a little little
[1:01:26] feeling or that's just the preacher
[1:01:28] saying a word but you but you recognize
[1:01:32] when Jesus passes your way Reach Out And
[1:01:34] Touch him reach out and get a hold of
[1:01:37] him like Jacob did the angel and said

[1:06:05] amen I I want to talk from the subject
[1:06:08] tonight uh from The Book of Luke uh we
[1:06:11] want to go to the Book of Luke and let
[1:06:13] me just get here to where it's at U Luke
[1:06:17] chapter 1 and verse 26 it's real
[1:06:20] familiar to you uh this is the encounter
[1:06:23] of God moving into human flesh
[1:06:27] now the Book of
[1:06:29] Genesis the second third chapter tells
[1:06:31] us how the devil got in the flesh but
[1:06:35] this is one going to tell us how God got
[1:06:38] in the flesh and in the sixth month the
[1:06:40] angel Gabriel was sent from God unto a
[1:06:43] city of Galilee named Nazareth and to a
[1:06:46] virgin espoused to a man whose name was
[1:06:48] Joseph of the House of David and the
[1:06:49] virgin's name was Mary and the angel
[1:06:53] came in unto her and said hell Thou Art
[1:06:57] highly favored for the Lord is with thee
[1:07:00] blessed art thou among women and when
[1:07:03] she saw him she was troubled at his
[1:07:06] saying and cast in her mind what manner
[1:07:09] of
[1:07:10] salutation would this be and the angel
[1:07:13] said unto her fear not Mary for thou
[1:07:16] found favor with God and behold thou
[1:07:18] shall conceive in thy womb and bring
[1:07:20] forth a son and thou shalt call his name
[1:07:24] Jesus and he he shall be great and he
[1:07:26] shall be called the son of the highest
[1:07:28] and the Lord God shall give unto him the
[1:07:30] Throne of his father David and he shall
[1:07:33] reign over the house of Jacob forever
[1:07:35] and the kingdom there shall be no end I
[1:07:39] tell you that's shout material right
[1:07:41] there is it amen then Mary said unto the
[1:07:44] angel how shall this be seeing I know
[1:07:50] not a man now this is not a question of
[1:07:54] doubt this is a question you're going to
[1:07:56] do it how's it going how you going to do
[1:07:57] this amen I don't know a man how's this
[1:08:00] going to be and the angel answered and
[1:08:02] said unto her the Holy Ghost shall
[1:08:04] overshadow thee and the power of the
[1:08:07] high shall overshadow thee and thou this
[1:08:10] holy thing which shall be born to thee
[1:08:12] shall be called The Son of God and
[1:08:15] behold thy cousin Eliz Elizabeth she has
[1:08:17] conceived a son in her old age and this
[1:08:21] is the sixth month with her from whom it
[1:08:23] was called baren
[1:08:26] for with God nothing shall be
[1:08:29] impossible and Mary said behold the hand
[1:08:32] made of the Lord be it unto me according
[1:08:34] to Thy word and the angel departed from
[1:08:37] her God bless you as you may be have
[1:08:39] your seats tonight I want to talk to you
[1:08:42] and if I would take a title I want to
[1:08:43] talk to you about the God of Miracles
[1:08:47] the god of Miracles this Mary was a
[1:08:51] person amen I believe who served God and
[1:08:55] her husband husband Joseph brother Ram
[1:08:56] tells us the drama it's a beautiful
[1:08:58] story uh he talks about how that when
[1:09:01] Mary met this Angel what must have been
[1:09:03] on her mind you know he said that maybe
[1:09:06] her and Joseph had just been down to the
[1:09:08] synagogue a couple days before and amen
[1:09:11] I I believe they probably were gathering
[1:09:12] there on Saturdays and hearing it and
[1:09:14] it's maybe along about Sunday or Monday
[1:09:17] morning amen she was headed down to the
[1:09:19] well and you know I've been there in
[1:09:21] those Eastern countries and and they got
[1:09:23] a usually a community well and many of
[1:09:25] you missionaries you've seen that where
[1:09:27] brother Forest they'll put something on
[1:09:28] their head and carry it down to get the
[1:09:30] water and carry it back and and she was
[1:09:32] just a young girl that was going to be
[1:09:34] helping doing the washing that morning
[1:09:36] uh for her mama so she went down there
[1:09:38] and picked all the morning uh morning
[1:09:40] water up and she was carrying it and
[1:09:42] brother R said just about the time she
[1:09:44] come to a corner he said uh it was just
[1:09:47] about the rising of the Sun and she was
[1:09:49] just in the corner of things and just
[1:09:51] seeing the sun rising and that's when
[1:09:53] the angel stepped out he said but when
[1:09:56] she first saw it she thought it was just
[1:09:57] a glisten maybe off of a a piece of
[1:09:59] metal or a piece of glass or something
[1:10:01] but then it began to become an angel and
[1:10:04] and it stood out in her path now he said
[1:10:06] now what she was thinking about is she
[1:10:08] was thinking about that sermon she had
[1:10:10] heard the day before and she had heard
[1:10:13] how that the the priest had talked about
[1:10:15] the greatness of God in the days of
[1:10:17] Moses and how God was had done all these
[1:10:20] wonderful things he said but he had come
[1:10:22] down to that scripture and talked about
[1:10:24] how that in the the book of Isaiah the
[1:10:26] 7th chapter that a virgin would conceive
[1:10:28] and he was talking about all these
[1:10:30] wonderful things and then the and then
[1:10:31] the uh the preacher said well I wish the
[1:10:34] god of the days of Moses was still that
[1:10:36] kind of God
[1:10:37] today said and after the service her and
[1:10:41] and her mama and Joseph sat around and
[1:10:43] talked about how amen how that he was
[1:10:46] doing such a good job until the preacher
[1:10:49] got to that part about God being the
[1:10:51] same today and said but you know we
[1:10:53] believe that that was the book of Isaiah
[1:10:56] and we believe that Isaiah was a
[1:10:57] Vindicated Prophet that he came from God
[1:11:00] and and that if God would use the mouth
[1:11:02] of a man like Isaiah to prophesy a
[1:11:05] virgin shall conceive we believe that
[1:11:07] that scripture would have to be the
[1:11:09] words of God and they're going to have
[1:11:11] to come to pass in somebody's life you
[1:11:13] know God doesn't have to prove his word
[1:11:15] in every person's life but if he just
[1:11:18] proves it in one person's life then that
[1:11:20] word is true and is proven amen and and
[1:11:23] that morning maybe when she was down to
[1:11:25] the well she would think it over that
[1:11:27] scripture of Isaiah and that's just when
[1:11:30] the when the angel stepped out and began
[1:11:32] to talk to her you know I believe that
[1:11:34] it's when we think on the things of God
[1:11:37] that's when we have encounters with God
[1:11:39] that's when we have encounters with the
[1:11:41] angel of God and and when she was
[1:11:43] thinking on that scripture she was
[1:11:44] thinking unto us a child is born a son
[1:11:47] is given she was thinking about a virgin
[1:11:49] would conceive and how them things must
[1:11:52] have been going over in her mind but
[1:11:54] when that angel met her he began to say
[1:11:56] Amen uh uh Mary thou had been favored of
[1:11:59] God and and to think when she begin to
[1:12:01] hear those words come to her Thou shalt
[1:12:04] have a son and amen and thou shalt call
[1:12:06] his name Jesus and he shall be the son
[1:12:08] of the highest how she must have begin
[1:12:10] to recognize that this is the Messiah
[1:12:12] that this is fing to come into my womb
[1:12:15] and she says how can this thing be you
[1:12:17] know amen she wasn't asking a question
[1:12:19] of doubt she was asking a question of
[1:12:22] how could it be that I'm going to
[1:12:23] conceive and bear when I haven't known a
[1:12:26] man but God gave her the instructions
[1:12:28] when he said to her Thou shalt be
[1:12:31] overshadowed by the Holy Ghost amen I
[1:12:34] believe that's an answer to a lot of
[1:12:36] things of how you're going to get
[1:12:37] something that God promised to you
[1:12:39] because sometimes it's not going to
[1:12:41] involve a man amen a man can't do things
[1:12:44] for you that God can do for you but the
[1:12:47] overshadowing of the Holy Ghost can
[1:12:49] change situations of lives and he can
[1:12:52] make things different in people's hearts
[1:12:54] because is still God Amen and when she
[1:12:57] began to and when she began to walk
[1:13:00] there she was walking thinking of the
[1:13:02] scriptures and that's when the angel met
[1:13:04] her and I'll tell you this if you want
[1:13:06] to have encounters with God get the word
[1:13:08] of God on your mind and and begin to
[1:13:10] think about it amen begin to think about
[1:13:12] the scriptures of our age and and the
[1:13:14] scriptures that's supposed to be
[1:13:15] manifested in our generation and let the
[1:13:18] Holy Spirit began to minister to you on
[1:13:20] it I believe it church I believe the
[1:13:22] Bible said in Romans the 8th chapter
[1:13:25] that there is now no more condemnation
[1:13:27] to them which are in Christ Jesus who
[1:13:29] walk not after the flesh but after the
[1:13:32] spirit now you can't change it that
[1:13:34] you're in the flesh but you don't have
[1:13:36] to walk after the flesh you can walk in
[1:13:39] the spirit of God whereby you're
[1:13:42] thinking on the things of God your your
[1:13:44] your your mind is on the things of God
[1:13:47] but walking after the spirit now in
[1:13:49] Romans 8:2 he said for the law of the
[1:13:52] spirit of life in Christ Jesus has made
[1:13:54] me free from the law of sin and death
[1:13:57] now here's the thing many people think
[1:13:58] because that I'm In the Flesh I can't
[1:14:01] walk in the spirit but amen even when I
[1:14:03] worship God people say well don't get in
[1:14:06] the flesh worshiping God but I live in
[1:14:08] the flesh so where else am I supposed to
[1:14:11] worship God am I supposed to wait till I
[1:14:13] have a theophany to worship God Amen but
[1:14:16] I'm going to worship God while I'm in
[1:14:18] this flesh and and you know what
[1:14:20] sometimes this flesh ain't going to feel
[1:14:22] like worshiping God but there's a man on
[1:14:25] the inside it that's not subject to the
[1:14:27] feelings of the thing that's in my flesh
[1:14:30] amen and I'm going to worship God when I
[1:14:33] don't feel like it and and when the
[1:14:34] devil's against me and my body is tired
[1:14:37] and everything is going but God is going
[1:14:39] to let me do it anyhow because the flesh
[1:14:42] don't have dominion over that man on the
[1:14:46] inside Hallelujah cuz there's a law
[1:14:49] you're you're living under the law of
[1:14:50] sin and death how many realizes that you
[1:14:52] live under the law of death if you don't
[1:14:54] know that and amen that's why that
[1:14:55] you're getting older and that's why
[1:14:57] you're amen gravity and and the feelings
[1:15:00] are setting upon us is because we're
[1:15:02] living under a law and that law is the
[1:15:05] law of sin and death it's a real law but
[1:15:10] the same as there is a law of sin and
[1:15:12] death there is a law of the spirit of
[1:15:17] life now this is the powerful thing to
[1:15:19] me amen is there are two laws now
[1:15:22] brother brandom says that there's two
[1:15:23] laws and God's law of course the law of
[1:15:27] sin and death came through Adam and was
[1:15:30] magnified on Mount SII when God gave the
[1:15:33] law unto man it magnified his weakness
[1:15:37] before God so anybody trying to live by
[1:15:41] the law amen automatically you're
[1:15:43] defeated because it's the law but it's
[1:15:45] the law of sin and death but there is
[1:15:48] another law and that is the law of Mount
[1:15:51] Calvary that whenever man fail in the
[1:15:54] Book of Genesis amen God came unto man
[1:15:57] and Grace amen came to them because God
[1:16:00] loved them and couldn't see them his
[1:16:03] children throwed out so God in his love
[1:16:06] made a way for them to return and
[1:16:08] remember what God said to them when he
[1:16:10] came in Genesis the 3r chapter and he
[1:16:12] said the woman's seed shall bruise the
[1:16:14] head of the Serpent's Seed remember when
[1:16:17] he said that amen because he was already
[1:16:19] making a covenant with them amen that
[1:16:22] I'm going to bring you back where you
[1:16:24] came from I'm I'm going to do that amen
[1:16:28] that God was going to do that when he
[1:16:29] met Abraham in the Book of Genesis whom
[1:16:32] we spoke a little bit on last night amen
[1:16:34] when God met Abraham in the Book of
[1:16:36] Genesis he said Abraham I have already
[1:16:39] blessed thee amen now he had already
[1:16:42] blessed him in Genesis 15 it was when
[1:16:45] Abraham asked God how are you going to
[1:16:47] do this just like Mary asked how Abraham
[1:16:51] asked how God you're going to do it and
[1:16:53] that's when God told Abraham take make
[1:16:55] yourself five sacrifices and lay them
[1:16:57] upon the Altar and remember when he
[1:16:59] divided all the sacrifices but he didn't
[1:17:01] sacri divide the turtle doves remember
[1:17:04] that because they represented Divine
[1:17:06] Healing and Divine Healing was both in
[1:17:08] the old Covenant and the New Covenant
[1:17:11] but God took the Beast of the altars and
[1:17:13] set them upon the Altar and when he did
[1:17:16] he caused Abraham to go to sleep I tell
[1:17:20] you it's a powerful thing because you
[1:17:22] don't have anything to do with the
[1:17:24] Covenant that God is going to use to
[1:17:26] save you matter of fact God put Abraham
[1:17:29] to sleep before he showed him the light
[1:17:32] that moved down between the sacrifices
[1:17:35] because God said I I'm going to save you
[1:17:38] Abraham and he was going to do it by the
[1:17:41] cross listen there is no salvation
[1:17:44] outside of the cross of Jesus Christ
[1:17:47] Jesus was the sacrifices on Abraham's
[1:17:51] altar amen Jesus was the blood of the bu
[1:17:55] and goats but that day at Calvary amen
[1:17:58] what he did when he finished the work of
[1:18:00] God I love those great words when he
[1:18:03] gave up The Ghost and he cried out it is
[1:18:09] finished he said it is finished amen
[1:18:12] then there was the day that we could say
[1:18:15] it's already done I don't know if you're
[1:18:18] aware of it or not amen but your
[1:18:20] salvation is already finished God canot
[1:18:23] do one more thing to save you tonight
[1:18:26] but he would send a gospel preacher and
[1:18:29] by the hearing of Faith heathens would
[1:18:32] be saved to them that Believe come on
[1:18:34] Romans 10:9 is still in my Bible it said
[1:18:37] he that believeth in his heart that
[1:18:39] Jesus is is a Son of God and confess it
[1:18:42] with his mouth Thou shalt be saved
[1:18:45] whosoever calleth upon the name of the
[1:18:48] Lord shall be saved and how shall you
[1:18:51] call upon whom you have not known and
[1:18:54] how can you hear without God sending a
[1:18:57] preacher to you come on church but the
[1:19:00] preaching of the word of God is the pr
[1:19:02] is the faith that comes into your heart
[1:19:05] that saves you that heals you because
[1:19:08] your salvation is finished your healing
[1:19:11] is finished let me just say this it's
[1:19:13] already done that is the law of life it
[1:19:17] is already done that's the law
[1:19:20] Christians live by it's not what we do
[1:19:23] ourself it's what God has done for us my
[1:19:28] goodness it's what God has done for us
[1:19:30] do you know that if by one man's offense
[1:19:33] death Reign by one then much more shall
[1:19:36] we receive abundance of grace and the
[1:19:38] gift of righteousness that shall reign
[1:19:40] in this life by one Jesus Christ if we
[1:19:44] all got into this shape because of what
[1:19:46] Adam did then why can't we all get out
[1:19:48] of this shape because of what Jesus did
[1:19:51] come on there's a first man Adam and
[1:19:54] there's a last man Adam if you had a
[1:19:56] bunch of skiers and they're all tied
[1:19:58] together and they're climbing a mountain
[1:20:00] and everybody's tied to the same rope
[1:20:03] and the first Adam fell off amen and
[1:20:06] everybody was going with him but the
[1:20:08] last Adam amen got a hold of something
[1:20:11] then one man caused the fall but the
[1:20:14] other man saved you all and tonight
[1:20:16] there was the last man Adam and climbed
[1:20:19] up to calvary's tree and he stood amen
[1:20:22] and made a way for every believer to
[1:20:24] hear tonight to be in the presence of
[1:20:26] God by one Faith see by one in this life
[1:20:31] we're not waiting to the Millennium to
[1:20:33] Reign but we are right now Kings and
[1:20:36] Priests of God come on Church you know
[1:20:38] it's true king is the highest in the
[1:20:41] Civil order and God said you were a king
[1:20:44] and a priest is the highest in the
[1:20:47] religious order and God said you're a
[1:20:49] priest we will not be Kings and Priests
[1:20:52] in the Millennium we are Kings and
[1:20:54] Priests right now tonight spiritual
[1:20:56] Kings reigning in this life over sin and
[1:21:00] death and we are reigning by the grace
[1:21:03] of God come on folks I I can read it to
[1:21:06] you we reign in this life by one you say
[1:21:09] reigning in this life do you know the
[1:21:11] prophet of God said you're reigning
[1:21:12] right now over sin over flesh and over
[1:21:16] the devil I know the devil don't like
[1:21:18] that kind of preaching but he's already
[1:21:20] under our feet that's why in Romans 16
[1:21:22] and 20 said the God of Peace shall Brew
[1:21:25] Satan under your feet that's why it says
[1:21:28] in Ephesians chapter 1 and verse 20 that
[1:21:30] Jesus has put all things under his feet
[1:21:34] and he sat down at the right hand of God
[1:21:37] where he gave us power over all
[1:21:41] things my goodness there is a law of
[1:21:44] death but there is a law of life I don't
[1:21:47] know of any other way to explain it
[1:21:49] really than the law of gravity and the
[1:21:50] law of aerodynamics the law of gravity I
[1:21:53] don't have to preach to you tonight you
[1:21:54] all know about that
[1:21:57] one now gravity Works more on some of us
[1:22:00] than
[1:22:02] others you don't have to have a
[1:22:04] bachelor's degree to know about gravity
[1:22:07] climb up there on that porch and jump
[1:22:09] off you will get a expedited
[1:22:12] education quickly you will understand
[1:22:15] the law of gravity is at work but you
[1:22:18] can also go maybe you want to go
[1:22:21] overseas tonight or you want to go to
[1:22:23] another place you can go down there to
[1:22:24] Little Rock or you can go over to
[1:22:26] Memphis and you can climb on a Jet Plane
[1:22:29] and go in there and sit down and they
[1:22:32] have got a law called The Law of
[1:22:35] aerodynamics that will actually break
[1:22:38] the law of gravity I tell you I thank
[1:22:40] God tonight to know there is a law that
[1:22:42] supersedes other laws sure it's true
[1:22:45] there's a law of death but there's also
[1:22:48] a law of life sure gravity is real but
[1:22:51] there's the law of hero Dynamics don't
[1:22:54] tell me it don't exist I have
[1:22:57] experienced the law superseding the
[1:23:00] other law yes I'm In the Flesh yes I
[1:23:03] struggle in the flesh but there is
[1:23:06] another law it is the law of life it is
[1:23:10] the law of the spirit of God that makes
[1:23:13] all other laws come subject to the law
[1:23:16] of God there's actually four laws to the
[1:23:19] law of aerodynamics amen their first
[1:23:21] four of those laws my dad used to be a
[1:23:24] pilot he knows all about these laws
[1:23:25] right here the law of aerodynamics the
[1:23:28] first law is
[1:23:29] lift you have to have lift and the law
[1:23:33] of of of of lift is a law of weight now
[1:23:37] there's four of them law of lift law of
[1:23:39] weight the third law is the law of
[1:23:41] thrust and there's the law of drag now
[1:23:43] what the law is speaking of is the lift
[1:23:47] has got to be greater than the weight
[1:23:50] amen now you'd be surprised how much
[1:23:51] them 747s weigh but they have built it
[1:23:54] in such a way that it can get lift no
[1:23:57] matter how much it weighs but you can
[1:24:00] understand now why if a church is going
[1:24:03] to go higher that it has to weigh less
[1:24:06] that's why amen that Paul said let us
[1:24:09] lay aside every weight that so easily
[1:24:13] besets us that we might run this race
[1:24:17] listen amen there's things that God has
[1:24:19] called you to do that you're overweight
[1:24:22] to do it you've got to lay aside some of
[1:24:25] your memories and some of your thinking
[1:24:27] and some of your ideas if you're going
[1:24:29] where I'm going you got to get lighter
[1:24:32] and be able to raise up in the power of
[1:24:35] God and see God do miracles in your age
[1:24:39] it's the law it's the law of lift if you
[1:24:42] want to get above it you got to get rid
[1:24:44] of the weight of sin and sin is unbelief
[1:24:47] sin is looking in the mirror and saying
[1:24:49] I can't never do it and I'm such a
[1:24:52] failure and I've always been a failure
[1:24:54] and I'll always be a failure oh but what
[1:24:57] about the blood of Jesus Christ what
[1:25:00] about Calvary what about what God did
[1:25:03] for you there is another
[1:25:07] law hallelujah it's a law of lift you
[1:25:10] know what the lifting power is the
[1:25:12] lifting power of the church is the blood
[1:25:15] of Jesus Christ if you're going to get
[1:25:17] off of the ground as a Believer you got
[1:25:20] to experience the power of the blood
[1:25:25] my goodness something that'll lift you
[1:25:28] up something that'll get you off of the
[1:25:30] ground now now there is a third law is a
[1:25:33] law of thrust and a law of drag now I
[1:25:36] don't know these preachers understand
[1:25:38] this some of you feel it maybe you don't
[1:25:39] know what it is sometimes but sometimes
[1:25:41] there's more drag than there is
[1:25:43] thrust sometimes you're trying to go
[1:25:45] somewhere and people standing on the
[1:25:47] brakes it's like getting out trying to
[1:25:49] push a car and looking in there and the
[1:25:52] person that's behind the wheels got both
[1:25:54] feet on the brakes we're trying to go
[1:25:56] somewhere and you're on the brakes let
[1:25:59] me let me just say to you tonight get
[1:26:01] off the brakes it's time to quit
[1:26:05] surpassing the same Mountain let's go
[1:26:08] northward let's go to the promises let's
[1:26:11] go to the power of God hallelujah I
[1:26:15] don't want to stay back there and argue
[1:26:17] all these things God has sent a prophet
[1:26:20] in this age and gave us a word
[1:26:24] that's why you never see an airplane
[1:26:26] flying with a parachute out the back
[1:26:29] amen that's why they're they don't do
[1:26:31] that they cut them loose because they
[1:26:33] got to have thrust they got to have
[1:26:35] forward movement and the church is
[1:26:38] moving on
[1:26:40] brother back there in the Old Testament
[1:26:42] they they would Camp amen but once in a
[1:26:45] while that Pillar of Fire would come by
[1:26:47] and they had to pull all their stakes
[1:26:49] and they had to get on the move because
[1:26:51] the pillar of fire was moving may I say
[1:26:54] to you tonight thus saith the Lord the
[1:26:58] move is on for the bride pull up your
[1:27:02] Pentecostal Stakes pull up your Baptist
[1:27:05] Stakes pull up your Lutheran Stakes we
[1:27:08] are going to The Rapture we're going to
[1:27:10] keep moving by the power of God because
[1:27:14] we are going
[1:27:16] forward hey we are not going backwards
[1:27:19] we are going forward this is the day of
[1:27:22] power
[1:27:24] if you're a studier of scripture the
[1:27:26] Bible says in Psalms 116 amen that when
[1:27:29] mecdc comes flesh that will be a people
[1:27:32] willing in the day of power well this is
[1:27:35] the day of
[1:27:37] power this is a power that can take you
[1:27:40] beyond churchianity there's a power that
[1:27:43] can take you beyond fear it can take you
[1:27:46] beyond your doubts it can take you into
[1:27:48] a realm where all things are
[1:27:52] possible now the church
[1:27:54] has got to get into the power of God to
[1:27:57] be lifted up in the presence of God Amen
[1:28:00] I believe this I believe we're in a
[1:28:02] place that we are to rub out all the
[1:28:04] make belief and the unbelief and get
[1:28:06] into something
[1:28:09] real I believe it I I believe we're in a
[1:28:12] place that excuse me that we are to be
[1:28:14] able to get into that and something to
[1:28:16] Lift Us higher this is like it was in
[1:28:18] the days of Noah and also like it was in
[1:28:23] the days of L
[1:28:25] there's two things Mysteries that Jesus
[1:28:27] didn't reveal when he said that he said
[1:28:30] one thing but left something unsaid and
[1:28:33] in the days of lot there was a
[1:28:35] visitation of Elohim to Abraham at the
[1:28:38] tent door it was a secret amen and in
[1:28:41] the days of Noah there was a Rapture of
[1:28:44] Enoch it was a secret and the secrets
[1:28:47] was not to be unfolded until the seven
[1:28:49] thunders of Revelations 10 was to be
[1:28:51] revealed and then the symbols would come
[1:28:53] on off of the book to identify where we
[1:28:56] are in the age we're living in now I'm
[1:28:58] not left my subject I want you to know
[1:29:01] the prophet said in the days of Noah
[1:29:03] amen the Enoch's pyramids they had a
[1:29:05] power to lift those great stones and put
[1:29:08] them in place he said but today we don't
[1:29:11] have the power it takes to put them
[1:29:14] Stones up there on that pyramid oh I'll
[1:29:18] tell you this the world has not
[1:29:20] discovered a power to get man higher
[1:29:23] than Church m ship they have not
[1:29:25] discovered a power to get them a faith
[1:29:28] or Temperance or godliness they can't
[1:29:31] get no higher than that but there's come
[1:29:33] a message from God there's come a blood
[1:29:36] there's come a holy ghost power that
[1:29:38] will lift men up and place them in the
[1:29:41] headship of Jesus Christ brother there's
[1:29:43] a message right now that can pick you up
[1:29:46] and take you to the mind of God where
[1:29:48] you were before the foundations of the
[1:29:51] world
[1:29:54] oh take me to Higher Ground Lord lift me
[1:29:58] up and let me stand where all things are
[1:30:01] possible in the presence of
[1:30:05] God a power to Lift
[1:30:08] Us amen it's a power I believe it today
[1:30:12] I believe as you begin to speak on the
[1:30:14] scriptures as you begin to meditate on
[1:30:17] the word that's when God begins to
[1:30:21] move it was when two men were on the
[1:30:24] road to
[1:30:25] EMAs that Jesus stepped out and began to
[1:30:29] talk with
[1:30:30] them you know what they were doing they
[1:30:32] were talking about things that had
[1:30:34] happened in that time but they wasn't
[1:30:36] even in the positive in that moment but
[1:30:39] when Jesus draw new to them he said
[1:30:42] what's the problem what you guys talking
[1:30:43] about here and they said are you a
[1:30:45] stranger in these parts have you not
[1:30:47] heard of all these things that's going
[1:30:49] on in the message I mean have you have
[1:30:51] heard of all these things and Jesus said
[1:30:54] what things what things what things are
[1:30:58] you focused on what things are the
[1:31:01] problems you're talking about come on
[1:31:03] it's time to change your perspective
[1:31:07] what are you looking at that's why you
[1:31:09] can't get off of the ground because
[1:31:11] you're seeing the problems you're seeing
[1:31:13] the troubles you're seeing the issues
[1:31:15] but if you would turn and look to Jesus
[1:31:18] you would find a power that'll lift you
[1:31:21] off of the Earth
[1:31:24] what things what things come on y'all
[1:31:26] know what I'm talking about what
[1:31:28] things now little did they know them men
[1:31:31] at Destiny Jesus had already died on the
[1:31:34] cross he had already ascended to the
[1:31:36] father done the work of the high priest
[1:31:38] had returned in a corporal an immortal
[1:31:40] body they were already without sin them
[1:31:44] men sin dead had been paid the
[1:31:46] resurrected one was standing in the
[1:31:48] midst of them and they were worried
[1:31:50] about some things that had been going on
[1:31:53] I tell you tonight I think we ought to
[1:31:55] quit worrying about things and start
[1:31:57] looking at what God has done in our
[1:32:01] age I believe it would bring Faith
[1:32:04] higher if we would look at what God has
[1:32:06] done in this age that's why Paul said
[1:32:09] forget those things which are behind you
[1:32:12] I'm glad he said things ain't you
[1:32:14] because he wasn't naming one thing he
[1:32:17] was naming whatever thing it is that's
[1:32:19] dragging you amen that's waiting you I
[1:32:23] believe you are to Cut Loose tonight and
[1:32:25] Rise higher in God where all things are
[1:32:32] possible well I feel like the preacher
[1:32:35] doesn't showed up
[1:32:36] tonight Hallelujah Cut Loose cut loose
[1:32:40] and let the Holy Ghost
[1:32:43] move I believe the
[1:32:46] church ought to be thinking about a god
[1:32:49] they didn't
[1:32:51] make now I don't know if in this here
[1:32:54] English language we use the word God as
[1:32:57] an object of worship but everybody you
[1:32:59] you know this that jobs can be God and
[1:33:02] and a piano can be God and your husband
[1:33:05] could be God your pastor could be your
[1:33:06] Gods you know people have gods of all
[1:33:09] kinds amen but the word God in the
[1:33:13] Hebrew is the word
[1:33:15] Elohim amen which is not the same as one
[1:33:19] that has created it is a self-existent
[1:33:22] one no other words there was nobody that
[1:33:26] created Our God and there was a time he
[1:33:30] wasn't even known to you as God he was
[1:33:33] known as Elohim he was self-existent
[1:33:36] because there was nothing to worship him
[1:33:39] but he created angels and he created the
[1:33:42] heavens and the Bible lets us know the
[1:33:45] Angels began to worship him and that's
[1:33:48] when he become God is when the Angels
[1:33:50] began to worship him he became an object
[1:33:54] of worship let me say something to you
[1:33:56] tonight amen do you know that that God
[1:33:59] is the god of those angels and he's the
[1:34:01] god of Abraham he said it and of Isaac
[1:34:04] and of Jacob because they worshiped him
[1:34:06] do you know he might be your mama's God
[1:34:08] he might be your grandparents God but he
[1:34:11] will never be your God until you begin
[1:34:14] to worship him as he
[1:34:20] is I don't know tonight you want to make
[1:34:22] him your God come on my God is not a God
[1:34:25] that created himself amen many people
[1:34:28] worship the god of their imaginations
[1:34:30] they worship the unknown God they
[1:34:32] worship gods of history and gods of
[1:34:34] tradition amen but I worship the God of
[1:34:38] this
[1:34:40] Bible the god that wrote this Bible and
[1:34:43] the actions of that God that's recorded
[1:34:45] in this Bible I certainly believe the
[1:34:48] Bible is the inspiration of God how many
[1:34:50] believe that the Bible said that it was
[1:34:52] written by in ins spiration as men were
[1:34:54] moved upon by inspiration and it's good
[1:34:56] for Doctrine and it's good for
[1:34:59] correction come on church that word by
[1:35:01] inspiration is by breath y'all know that
[1:35:03] it's the Greek word breath then God
[1:35:06] breathed the scriptures out and in them
[1:35:09] are pregnated with the same power of the
[1:35:13] one that wrote the Bible is inside the
[1:35:15] letters that was put on the Bible this
[1:35:18] Bible is the letter form of almighty God
[1:35:22] everything in it he is and everything he
[1:35:25] did he will do and all that he said he
[1:35:28] was he is because he's not the I am amen
[1:35:32] just the I was he is the I am that I
[1:35:38] am he say preacher what are you what are
[1:35:41] you really getting at I'll tell you what
[1:35:42] I'm getting at Malachi the third chapter
[1:35:43] the Bible said I am God and I change
[1:35:47] not and and you well that's the Old
[1:35:50] Testament let me go to the New Testament
[1:35:51] Hebrews 13 and verse 8 said Jesus Christ
[1:35:55] is the same yesterday today and
[1:36:00] forever I love that don't you then we
[1:36:03] finally found something that's not
[1:36:05] changing we found something that's not
[1:36:08] altering he is an unchanging God with
[1:36:11] unchanging ways now the world may change
[1:36:15] but not
[1:36:17] God your conditions might change but not
[1:36:20] God your church can change but not God
[1:36:24] can I say this the only thing that won't
[1:36:26] change is there is change coming except
[1:36:29] for God but that God who don't change he
[1:36:33] don't change his nature he don't change
[1:36:35] his aspect but he changes the form that
[1:36:38] he's in so therefore we know him whether
[1:36:41] he's in a wind or whether he's in a fire
[1:36:44] or whether he's in a man or whether he's
[1:36:46] in his word or whether he's in the stars
[1:36:49] or whether he's in the flowers we can
[1:36:52] identify him because he's a God that
[1:36:55] does not
[1:36:57] change let me ask you what is it that
[1:37:00] put the color in the flowers out there
[1:37:03] it's the same God that put the lift
[1:37:06] under the Robin's wings so they could
[1:37:08] fly it's the same God that put the color
[1:37:11] of hair in your head that you could be
[1:37:13] here tonight he is the same God for
[1:37:15] every
[1:37:18] generation now he is Elohim I don't
[1:37:21] believe he is just a God that that we've
[1:37:23] created but we're worshiping the God of
[1:37:26] this
[1:37:27] Bible I'm worshiping the god that
[1:37:29] created the heavens and earth can you
[1:37:30] imagine the god that hung the the moon
[1:37:33] in its place and the sun now nobody has
[1:37:36] ever went out in the morning and seen a
[1:37:39] big cable hanging off of the
[1:37:41] sun because it don't hang there by
[1:37:44] cables it don't hang there by
[1:37:46] Angels according to Hebrews the first
[1:37:48] chapter the Bible said he created the
[1:37:51] heavens and the Earth and they're held
[1:37:52] there by the word of his power God told
[1:37:56] the sun were to be and it's there
[1:37:57] because the word said it would be there
[1:38:00] if that word could make the sun hold its
[1:38:02] position how much more could it hold a
[1:38:06] Believer that's why Jude said we are
[1:38:09] kept by the power of
[1:38:12] God unto him that is able to keep us
[1:38:15] from falling now watch what we're
[1:38:17] looking and seeing that there is the god
[1:38:19] who created that's the same God who came
[1:38:22] down and identif ified himself to
[1:38:24] Abraham do y'all know that when God
[1:38:26] identified himself to Abraham he
[1:38:28] identified him as that Creator and he
[1:38:30] came down now that's a that's a very big
[1:38:32] word and I won't preach on it tonight
[1:38:34] but he came down how far did he come
[1:38:36] down anyhow did he come down just to
[1:38:39] angelics because God's above that but he
[1:38:42] didn't God came below angels and blew
[1:38:45] himself a dust body and he didn't just
[1:38:48] get into a young man he got into an
[1:38:50] older man who gravity was already
[1:38:52] working on that was dust on his clothes
[1:38:55] come on now he was God he could have
[1:38:58] stayed as high as he wanted to but he
[1:39:00] come down to an older man he come down
[1:39:03] to dust on his clothes he come down to
[1:39:05] the heat of the day and he set in the
[1:39:08] tent door of a man who was a vagabond
[1:39:11] cast out of the world because God can
[1:39:13] condens send it's his nature well let me
[1:39:16] say this the Bible said the Lord himself
[1:39:18] shall descend from heaven with a shout
[1:39:21] and with a voice and with a trump let me
[1:39:23] ask you how far could God come
[1:39:26] down the god you Ser how far can he come
[1:39:29] down can he just come down to a prophet
[1:39:32] can he come down just to Jeffersonville
[1:39:34] can he come down just to a group can he
[1:39:36] come down just to your family no I
[1:39:39] believe God can infold himself and get
[1:39:42] in the youngest child he can get in the
[1:39:45] widow woman he can get in the daddy can
[1:39:47] get in the
[1:39:48] mama and he's the kind of God that don't
[1:39:51] change no matter where you put him
[1:39:55] I don't know some people they serve a
[1:39:57] little bitty God Amen because they think
[1:40:00] that God's too busy to hear their
[1:40:02] prayers I don't serve that kind of God I
[1:40:04] don't worship that the God I serve is so
[1:40:06] big he can individualize every person in
[1:40:09] this building and he can give you a
[1:40:11] personal interview in the middle of a
[1:40:13] meeting he can speak to everybody in
[1:40:16] this building at the same time and just
[1:40:19] be talking to you
[1:40:24] he's not limited on space or
[1:40:27] time he's a great big God he's the god
[1:40:30] that created the heavens and the Earth
[1:40:32] that was the same God that Abraham met
[1:40:35] that made him the promise is the same
[1:40:37] God that met Moses in that
[1:40:41] bush and actually introduced himself as
[1:40:44] Abraham's
[1:40:45] God now Moses tells about the whole
[1:40:48] story in Genesis and he tells in Genesis
[1:40:50] 18 the story of the one that met him and
[1:40:53] the the bush he tells of the story of
[1:40:56] how he was Abraham's God now if somebody
[1:40:58] tells you a story they heard it from
[1:41:00] somebody and let me assure you Moses
[1:41:03] hadn't talked to
[1:41:06] Abraham so Moses's account of what
[1:41:09] happened to Abraham was given to him by
[1:41:11] the god that met Abraham and he had a
[1:41:15] perfect account of how God would visit a
[1:41:17] generation and that God that met Abraham
[1:41:20] gave him a child in his own age
[1:41:24] it caused his wife who was Barren to
[1:41:26] have a child that was the same God that
[1:41:28] made Moses and said I'll deliver my
[1:41:30] children with a mighty hand now you you
[1:41:33] you we don't have time to go in the
[1:41:34] depths of this but I'll say this God is
[1:41:36] a God who is
[1:41:38] Supernatural and that is the
[1:41:40] characteristic of God he's Supernatural
[1:41:43] so you know if you're if you're out in
[1:41:45] the west and you're elk hunting and you
[1:41:47] see a mu deer how do you know the
[1:41:49] difference well there's some
[1:41:50] characteristics right and if you wasn't
[1:41:52] real knowing you might think that mule
[1:41:55] de is a white tail but watch it run off
[1:41:57] that dude if you ain't never seen it's a
[1:41:59] funny looking thing they hop on Fall
[1:42:00] fourest amen if they take off they don't
[1:42:02] look like no white tail there's a
[1:42:04] characteristic that shows you what
[1:42:06] you're dealing with and when you're
[1:42:07] dealing with the God of this Bible there
[1:42:10] is a characteristic he carries it is the
[1:42:12] characteristic of the Supernatural and
[1:42:14] God had told Moses I'm going to deliver
[1:42:17] these people amen so when God sent Moses
[1:42:20] down there Moses is just a man but God
[1:42:24] shows up in the Supernatural to show
[1:42:26] them I sent this man down
[1:42:30] here now if you're a study of scripture
[1:42:33] you know that God called Israel his
[1:42:35] first born and that Egypt had the
[1:42:38] firstborn and they gave the power over
[1:42:42] Egypt to their plaguing Gods you know
[1:42:44] they had the god of the Nile and they
[1:42:46] had the god of
[1:42:47] f had fertility and they if you're study
[1:42:51] I don't have time to deep into these
[1:42:52] things but I'll just take you this Egypt
[1:42:54] had 10 major deities and they worshiped
[1:42:57] them major deities and you'll find out
[1:43:00] when God came down there he executed
[1:43:03] judgment upon the Bible said the gods of
[1:43:06] Egypt so every plague if you study every
[1:43:09] plague that God gave there in in Egypt
[1:43:13] was a plague over one of the deities of
[1:43:15] Egypt whom they worshiped God exercised
[1:43:19] power over the Nile and turned it into
[1:43:21] blood to prove to to them that this God
[1:43:24] of the Nile is a perversion of the
[1:43:27] creator of heavens and earth you see
[1:43:29] what he done he took power and showed
[1:43:32] I'm the one that created the Frog I'm
[1:43:35] the one that created the hells I'm the
[1:43:38] one that can rain fire I'm the one that
[1:43:40] can cause Locust to
[1:43:43] come now God showed power over one every
[1:43:46] one of those deities I love how the
[1:43:49] Bible tells us that when God got ready
[1:43:50] for the children of Israel to go can you
[1:43:52] imagine two million of them's going to
[1:43:54] leave at one time you know what they
[1:43:56] were going to leave so fast that Moses
[1:43:59] told them when you make the bread for
[1:44:01] the supper the Passover supper don't put
[1:44:04] any leav in the bread cuz you ain't
[1:44:06] going to stay long enough for it to
[1:44:09] rise Hallelujah can you imagine amen
[1:44:13] you've been 400 years AB bond in Egypt
[1:44:16] and the man of God says y'all cook
[1:44:17] supper tonight but leave the leaven out
[1:44:19] of the bread cuz you ain't going to be
[1:44:21] here long enough for it to
[1:44:23] R come on Church y'all know that's Jesus
[1:44:26] right you know he wasn't going to stay
[1:44:28] in the Tomb 72 hours he was going to
[1:44:31] rise before corruption could ever set in
[1:44:33] it was the showing of the Resurrection
[1:44:36] in Ty because Jesus is the same
[1:44:41] God well it's the
[1:44:43] truth look what he did I love how he
[1:44:46] said it to him he said when you eat this
[1:44:48] food he said do it with a staff in your
[1:44:50] hand amen put your clothes on put your
[1:44:54] shoes on you're going to eat this
[1:44:56] message with your shoes
[1:44:59] on Amen I think it's time to put your
[1:45:02] shoes on because somebody's going to
[1:45:04] leave here pretty
[1:45:07] soon you know what my Bible says it said
[1:45:10] when they left there they didn't leave
[1:45:12] nobody behind do you know it said there
[1:45:14] was not a feeble one among
[1:45:17] them some of the some of the New
[1:45:19] Testament or some of the new new age you
[1:45:22] know theologian they'll say well it's
[1:45:24] because they left the the feeble behind
[1:45:27] you know they meant there was no feeble
[1:45:29] among them they left the feeble behind
[1:45:31] but that's not what happened because God
[1:45:33] gave an entire conversation between
[1:45:36] Moses and Pharaoh about Moses and
[1:45:39] pharaoh and Pharaoh keeps saying to
[1:45:41] Moses well you can just take the cattle
[1:45:43] and go or you can just take just leave
[1:45:45] your young people and go and after a
[1:45:48] while there's an entire conversation
[1:45:50] where Moses said to Pharaoh we're not
[1:45:52] leaving a hoof behind they didn't leave
[1:45:55] a young person behind they didn't leave
[1:45:57] any Elders behind they didn't leave any
[1:46:00] sick people behind because what they
[1:46:02] were eating was a bread that could heal
[1:46:06] the
[1:46:08] body I tell you tonight there's a bride
[1:46:11] eating a message amen that it'll take
[1:46:14] our young people home it'll take our
[1:46:16] elders home and we're not going to have
[1:46:18] one left behind because God don't have
[1:46:21] to leave nobody
[1:46:24] behind he is a god of Miracles look that
[1:46:27] same God that they were serving that
[1:46:30] same God that went with them I I'll tell
[1:46:32] you what I I don't have a I don't I
[1:46:34] don't have the time to dig deep into
[1:46:36] these things but I just want to brush
[1:46:38] over them but I'll tell you this amen
[1:46:40] there is 83 miracles in the Old
[1:46:44] Testament and that's just that's just uh
[1:46:46] exposed Miracles right out in the open
[1:46:48] 83 Miracles there is another 80 found in
[1:46:51] the New Testament we're talking about
[1:46:54] over 160 Miracles spanning the entire
[1:46:57] Bible amen and there are people today
[1:47:00] who don't believe in
[1:47:02] miracles amen I say this if you don't
[1:47:04] believe in miracles you just don't
[1:47:05] believe your
[1:47:09] Bible now now you know we're in a season
[1:47:13] now we're in a season now amen when we
[1:47:16] look around and we see how things are
[1:47:19] but when these people were following
[1:47:21] Moses the Bible tells tells us that
[1:47:23] there they didn't have sick people among
[1:47:25] them it tells us that their clothes
[1:47:28] didn't wear out it tells us when they
[1:47:31] got hungry now now some of you masas are
[1:47:34] feeding four and five and some of you
[1:47:35] feed seven some of you feed a couple
[1:47:37] what happens when you have about 10 or
[1:47:39] 12 people show up for supper
[1:47:41] unannounced amen you feel the pressure
[1:47:43] of not having enough right Moses had two
[1:47:47] million
[1:47:49] people on the
[1:47:51] move he didn't have where he could build
[1:47:54] fields and just and take the Harvesters
[1:47:57] and and they were they were actually on
[1:47:59] the Move amen so he had two million
[1:48:01] people it's one thing to call people out
[1:48:04] it's another thing to feed them once
[1:48:05] they're out and he calls them out and
[1:48:08] here they are walking you know they got
[1:48:10] into a place they got hungry for meat
[1:48:12] y'all know that but the Bible says when
[1:48:15] they did God actually told them now the
[1:48:17] same God that delivered them come in the
[1:48:20] Book of Numbers the 19th 11th chapter
[1:48:22] and it says here amen that God who who
[1:48:25] give us flesh to eat he said for it was
[1:48:28] well with us in Egypt therefore the Lord
[1:48:30] give us flesh to eat and you shall not
[1:48:32] eat one day God said I'm going to give
[1:48:34] you not for two days or not for five
[1:48:36] days or not for 10 days or not for 20
[1:48:39] I'll give you a whole month's worth and
[1:48:42] I'll give you so much Quail until it
[1:48:44] comes out your
[1:48:46] nostrils now you know where that's
[1:48:48] saying he's got money running out of his
[1:48:49] nose he got Quail out of his no that's
[1:48:52] scripture amen they had Quail running
[1:48:54] out their nose because God was a God who
[1:48:57] created Quail now it was a month's worth
[1:49:00] now if you if you're just just take just
[1:49:02] a moment I want you to see the abundance
[1:49:04] we serving the same God the abundance
[1:49:06] that was given according to numbers
[1:49:08] 11:31 the Bible said it was a wind went
[1:49:11] forth from the Lord and brought quails
[1:49:13] from the sea and let them fall by the
[1:49:15] campers it was a day Journey on this
[1:49:18] side and it was a Day's Journey on the
[1:49:20] other side and around about the camp
[1:49:22] were two cubits High to the face of the
[1:49:24] Earth amen now watch this the least one
[1:49:27] among them gathered 10 rers about 55
[1:49:31] bushels now what now what's a Day's
[1:49:34] Journey now of course according to how
[1:49:35] fit you are I guess but I looked at cost
[1:49:38] of maybe maybe it's 15 miles one way
[1:49:41] you're talking about a 30 mile
[1:49:43] circumference of the center of that camp
[1:49:46] and you're talking about three foot
[1:49:50] deep now look folks I know know that
[1:49:53] there's such a thing of abundance but
[1:49:55] this was abundant above what they could
[1:49:58] think or even ask they you you recognize
[1:50:01] this that was 600,000 fighting men do
[1:50:04] y'all know that amen and they were
[1:50:07] 33,000 bushels of quail that was taken
[1:50:09] up it would take it would take them amen
[1:50:13] I I I I I I it's it's crazy but there
[1:50:16] was 200 I got a couple phds I guess
[1:50:20] they're pretty smart guys and I put a
[1:50:22] test to them how many this many miles
[1:50:24] wide this deep and how many quails will
[1:50:26] fill a certain spot and you know what
[1:50:28] they come back with
[1:50:30] 250 billion
[1:50:34] Quail B with a
[1:50:38] billion there was
[1:50:41] 250 billion
[1:50:45] Quail you know what my Bible tells me it
[1:50:48] tells me that's a
[1:50:50] lot amen you you you know now watch
[1:50:54] 250 billion Quail they were stacked up
[1:50:57] three foot deep
[1:51:00] man now you're talking about a God who
[1:51:03] can create quail and he can bring It
[1:51:05] Forward under the people until it was so
[1:51:09] deep until there was so many that they
[1:51:12] didn't even know what to do with it
[1:51:14] because he's that kind of a god you you
[1:51:17] see they got thirsty and and and and
[1:51:19] they needed water they're in the middle
[1:51:21] of a desert what are you get water in
[1:51:23] the desert you don't unless you're with
[1:51:25] the God who created the
[1:51:27] desert and when they looked in all of
[1:51:29] the ponds and they looked in the streams
[1:51:32] they couldn't find any but if you're a
[1:51:34] Bible reader you know the Bible said in
[1:51:36] Corinthians that Paul said that Jesus
[1:51:39] was The Rock in the wilderness and he
[1:51:42] followed them wheresoever they
[1:51:47] went I tell you what can you imagine
[1:51:49] they're walking across the desert and oh
[1:51:51] hey man hey and and oh oh Aaron looks
[1:51:54] over at Moses he said hey we've been
[1:51:56] walking for about 3 days and I could
[1:51:58] swear that's that same rock that was
[1:52:00] there three days ago how did that thing
[1:52:03] get over here where we are the Bible
[1:52:05] said that rock follow them in the
[1:52:09] wilderness wherever they went you said
[1:52:11] well that's amazing let me tell you one
[1:52:13] better than that Jesus said yet a little
[1:52:15] while and the world see me no more but
[1:52:18] you shall be me I will be with you even
[1:52:21] in you until the the End of the Age
[1:52:23] listen he is right inside of the Church
[1:52:27] of the Living
[1:52:29] God where we going to get water around
[1:52:32] here amen we'll get it right out of that
[1:52:34] rock God told Moses go take your your
[1:52:37] staff and smite that rock the driest
[1:52:40] thing in the entire
[1:52:43] desert that might not mean much to Son
[1:52:45] but it did to me the prophet of God said
[1:52:48] that rock was about the size of a
[1:52:50] desk amen now some people draw that
[1:52:54] there was a little dribble coming out of
[1:52:55] that rock but that's not at all true do
[1:52:59] you recognize that there were over two
[1:53:03] million
[1:53:05] people now if you start counting this
[1:53:08] you recognize it would take
[1:53:11] 1.2 million gallons a day to give water
[1:53:16] to people if they just had 64
[1:53:19] ounces can you imagine now 64 ounces a
[1:53:23] day walking in the desert it would take
[1:53:26] 1.2 million gallons a day just for the
[1:53:30] people what about the 10 to 30 gallons a
[1:53:33] day for the cows amen what about the
[1:53:36] Sheep amen what about amen the camels
[1:53:39] who could drink five gallons a day we're
[1:53:41] talking about they had a need of
[1:53:44] abundance to come out of that rock they
[1:53:46] needed an average of 96 million gallons
[1:53:50] of water a day just to survive with
[1:53:54] humans and their livestock you amen come
[1:53:57] on Church we're talking about coming out
[1:53:59] of a death siiz Rock we're talking about
[1:54:01] a gusher that looked like Old Faithful
[1:54:04] out there amen it was a great gusher of
[1:54:07] God that was coming out of that rock
[1:54:09] because he was a god of Miracles now
[1:54:12] listen I I I'm I'm just that guy I got
[1:54:14] to think about things and I think about
[1:54:16] this water coming out Benji I'm thinking
[1:54:18] that that water didn't go out 10 feet
[1:54:20] and run down in the sand I'm I'm I
[1:54:23] imagine there was a river come out of
[1:54:24] there and you know what there was Arabs
[1:54:26] down in that desert and there were
[1:54:28] people that didn't even know Abraham at
[1:54:30] all and they were down there watering
[1:54:32] their cattle and maybe they were Ming
[1:54:34] rain dances or whatever thing they were
[1:54:37] doing but the reason they had water is
[1:54:40] because amen Moses was in The
[1:54:43] Country Church I hope you're hearing me
[1:54:46] the reason there's a move of God the
[1:54:48] reason the Pentecostals are feeling the
[1:54:50] spirit the reason inspiration songs are
[1:54:53] written it's because there's water from
[1:54:56] the rock for God's children in this age
[1:54:59] there's been an opening of Seven
[1:55:01] Seals I know there's people don't even
[1:55:03] like contemporary music they think if it
[1:55:05] was a new song written or something from
[1:55:07] the devil waen would it ever would it
[1:55:09] ever imagine to people that there's some
[1:55:11] songs can't be written at some times if
[1:55:14] you're a Bible reader the first song
[1:55:16] that was ever written in the Bible was a
[1:55:19] song Moses sang at the Red Sea when it
[1:55:21] parted and he sang a song about a sea
[1:55:24] opening and about an army being drowned
[1:55:27] because it was the first and actually
[1:55:29] composers believe it was the first song
[1:55:31] ever written in history somebody wrote a
[1:55:35] new song at some time and when John saw
[1:55:38] the Lamb's Book opened up he wrote a new
[1:55:41] song Come On Church there's a lot of
[1:55:43] people that's in the Lamb's Book of Life
[1:55:45] but not very many people know they're in
[1:55:48] the Lamb's Book of Life but we're living
[1:55:50] in an age where the message of God has
[1:55:52] opened up this message and songs are
[1:55:55] being sung today that could have never
[1:55:58] been sung another time in the history of
[1:56:00] the
[1:56:01] world now I get it some of the music
[1:56:04] they play I don't agree with it either
[1:56:05] amen but there's some there's some words
[1:56:07] that's being written under inspiration
[1:56:09] that don't belong to them to start
[1:56:13] with just CU they pick it up don't mean
[1:56:16] it belongs to
[1:56:18] them I can prove to you amen that the
[1:56:21] grafted bre is living off of the life of
[1:56:24] the original
[1:56:26] tree it was a gusher from The Rock Amen
[1:56:29] what was it because God Amen is a god of
[1:56:33] Miracles look at this one brother
[1:56:35] brandom tells us about how amen that he
[1:56:38] created a squirrel I want you to think
[1:56:41] about the beauty of this brother BR said
[1:56:43] I was out squirrel
[1:56:44] hunting now we would think the only time
[1:56:48] that great miracles happen is in the
[1:56:50] church but that's not the God we serve
[1:56:52] God does miracles in church but many of
[1:56:55] the Great Miracles are not even done in
[1:56:57] church they're done in them fellowship
[1:57:00] with God in even your private places
[1:57:04] brother randam tells us a story here how
[1:57:06] he was out squirrel hunting and while he
[1:57:08] was out squirrel hunting he was sitting
[1:57:10] next to an old sycamore tree and he was
[1:57:13] thinking about the scripture of Mark 11
[1:57:16] of how it is that God could say a man if
[1:57:20] he would say unto a mountain it could be
[1:57:22] moved and he said while I was thinking
[1:57:25] on
[1:57:26] it it was there for the first time he
[1:57:29] declared to me the new ministry think on
[1:57:32] him draw nigh unto me and I will draw
[1:57:37] nigh unto you think upon him watch this
[1:57:42] in Mark 11 that's the scripture isn't
[1:57:44] the scripture but scripture is written
[1:57:46] for a generation y'all believe that
[1:57:49] somebody said well I tell you what
[1:57:50] everything was done in Abraham's today
[1:57:52] it's not true do you know that God
[1:57:54] promised Abraham the land but according
[1:57:56] to acts the 7th chapter Abraham never
[1:57:58] possessed that land you can read it
[1:58:00] right of the Bible he said Abraham never
[1:58:03] possessed a foot of that land but God
[1:58:05] promised it to Abraham but it wasn't
[1:58:07] until Joshua that they actually
[1:58:10] possessed the land that God had gave
[1:58:12] promised so God will promise to one
[1:58:15] generation what he's going to do in
[1:58:17] another generation I can prove it by the
[1:58:20] Bible come on Corinthians amen you he
[1:58:22] said that flesh and blood cannot inherit
[1:58:24] the kingdom of God but there will come a
[1:58:26] time that this Mortal shall put on
[1:58:27] immortality and this corruption shall
[1:58:29] put on incorruption he's talking about a
[1:58:32] body change the corini did not take the
[1:58:35] body change but Paul promised it to one
[1:58:39] age but God's going to give it to
[1:58:41] another
[1:58:43] [Applause]
[1:58:45] age see God of Miracles is not in our
[1:58:49] past it's right here in our future and
[1:58:52] as long as there is scriptures that give
[1:58:54] the god of Miracles right here tonight
[1:58:57] do you see what he was saying he was
[1:58:59] saying if thou say us Jesus said them
[1:59:01] words but not one place in all of the
[1:59:03] Sacred Scriptures was that ever
[1:59:05] fulfilled there was no disciple ever
[1:59:08] spoke the word and created in his day
[1:59:11] Jesus himself actually stood and took
[1:59:15] fish and multiplied it he took bread and
[1:59:18] multiplied it he never one time created
[1:59:21] as he did in the beginning but he
[1:59:24] prophesied that the power of the
[1:59:27] blood come on Church Jesus said in John
[1:59:30] 14 he said the works that I do shall ye
[1:59:33] do also he said because I go unto the
[1:59:37] father come on there wasn't two of them
[1:59:39] up there but Jesus was the last man Adam
[1:59:43] that gave his life for the church look
[1:59:46] and when God came into a man and a man
[1:59:49] was sacrificed for the church now
[1:59:51] brother brother Bryce a man like you and
[1:59:54] I our race climb to the throne of God
[1:59:58] and sets in power tonight come on folks
[2:00:02] we are not without power as long as
[2:00:05] Jesus Christ is our
[2:00:08] God he sets in the power tonight and all
[2:00:12] things are possible to him and all
[2:00:14] things are of him look when he says that
[2:00:16] it would be able to create now somebody
[2:00:18] said well what's that got to do with the
[2:00:20] cross got everything to do with the
[2:00:21] cross
[2:00:23] because of the Cross there was a giving
[2:00:26] of the power of the blood that would
[2:00:28] bring an atonement back until God could
[2:00:31] actually get in man and use
[2:00:34] him how it happened the first time is
[2:00:38] when he was sitting there he had
[2:00:40] scripture in his
[2:00:42] mind he said I I had scripture in my
[2:00:46] mind I was thinking now preacher you
[2:00:49] said what are you doing I'm teaching you
[2:00:50] how to have a miracle yes I'm teaching
[2:00:52] you how spoken word comes to a believer
[2:00:55] I'm teaching you how healing comes how
[2:00:57] the Holy Ghost comes how Deliverance
[2:00:59] comes he took a scripture and was
[2:01:02] dwelling on the scripture and something
[2:01:05] struck him inspiration came to him amen
[2:01:10] what was it it was that's what the
[2:01:12] atonement was
[2:01:16] for that's what the atonement was for
[2:01:19] listen Adam had those things in the
[2:01:20] Garden of Eden didn't he
[2:01:23] come on you know he did before the fall
[2:01:26] Adam had them things in the garden but
[2:01:28] sister Anna when Adam had him he didn't
[2:01:30] have any complexes he didn't have any
[2:01:33] fear he didn't have any failure that was
[2:01:36] no sin to overcome there was no leosa
[2:01:39] there was no God of this evil age it was
[2:01:41] all perfect in the garden and he
[2:01:43] exercised these things in a place of
[2:01:47] perfection but when God called you to
[2:01:50] operate the miracle work power of God he
[2:01:54] called you to do it in this age of
[2:01:55] leosia and here you are tonight with
[2:01:58] your complexes but God says I'm I'm a
[2:02:01] miracle working God you got your fears
[2:02:03] but he says I'm a miracle working God
[2:02:05] you got all of these reasons why that
[2:02:08] God can't move but God is a miracle
[2:02:12] working God is the same yesterday today
[2:02:16] and
[2:02:19] forever for I say unto you you that
[2:02:22] whosoever shall say un this mountain be
[2:02:24] moved and cast in the sea shall not
[2:02:26] doubt in his heart but Shall Believe
[2:02:28] those things which shall come to pass he
[2:02:30] shall have it whatsoever he
[2:02:35] saith you say preacher what are you
[2:02:37] talking about when God did this he
[2:02:41] opened it up for
[2:02:43] manifestation when God performed this he
[2:02:46] opened it up to every believer that's
[2:02:48] setting in this building tonight can I
[2:02:50] get this clear to you I do not believe
[2:02:52] that every believer in here has to speak
[2:02:54] this word nor create squirrels nor do I
[2:02:58] believe amen that every one of you will
[2:03:01] but I am very contentious in the fact
[2:03:03] that the potential to do so is in every
[2:03:06] believer in this building from the
[2:03:09] youngest to the oldest from the weakest
[2:03:11] to the strongest the power of the blood
[2:03:15] restored us back to the power of the
[2:03:17] word of God that lives in humanity God
[2:03:21] did this for the manifestation of the
[2:03:23] sons of God when true Sons born Sons
[2:03:26] begin to speak the word of God Amen the
[2:03:29] word is backed by the power of God this
[2:03:32] is for the day of manifestations I know
[2:03:34] the church has buil hospitals and I know
[2:03:37] the church has built churches and that
[2:03:39] is good for the ages but it won't do for
[2:03:42] the manifestation of the sons of God the
[2:03:44] whole creation granth for the
[2:03:47] manifestation of the sons of God this is
[2:03:50] not just another day this is the day of
[2:03:53] the opening of the power of God that is
[2:03:56] restored back to
[2:03:59] mankind may I say this beloved we are
[2:04:02] now the sons of God we're not going to
[2:04:05] be right now we are the sons of God
[2:04:08] beloved we're the sons of God look at
[2:04:10] what a brother bam tells us this he told
[2:04:13] us these things that these scriptures
[2:04:15] teach us the Reason God is opening these
[2:04:18] things is to bring his son his his sons
[2:04:23] into
[2:04:26] manifestation do you know it's been
[2:04:28] prophesied over to you I believe a real
[2:04:30] church is on the road the power of the
[2:04:32] Living God that men will speak the word
[2:04:34] here and there and it will flash like
[2:04:35] lightning there is a church coming out
[2:04:38] not a psychologist not a put on not a
[2:04:41] make belief but a real true genuine
[2:04:44] anointed Holy Ghost called out church I
[2:04:47] don't believe it's on the road tonight I
[2:04:50] believe it's here I believe believe we
[2:04:52] have come to the ending of the ages
[2:04:54] listen somebody said well brother Wayne
[2:04:56] I believe there's coming a short
[2:04:57] powerful work there's coming a great
[2:04:58] Revival there's coming this there's
[2:05:00] coming this listen and at the same time
[2:05:03] you're saying that Russia could blow us
[2:05:05] up in the morning then you tell me when
[2:05:08] are you going to give time for the
[2:05:10] manifestation of the sons of God and who
[2:05:13] is it that's going to be good enough to
[2:05:15] do it I say we are the people that God
[2:05:18] has called to this age for manifestation
[2:05:21] of word and I believe this is the
[2:05:25] time if you're looking at yourself it
[2:05:28] ain't going to work but if you're
[2:05:29] looking at the blood if you're looking
[2:05:31] at the
[2:05:35] message you say preacher how is this
[2:05:38] going to happen I'll tell you what a
[2:05:39] prophet of God said he said when the
[2:05:41] human element goes
[2:05:43] out when the human element goes out now
[2:05:48] now folks they ain't nobody in this
[2:05:50] building more aware of human ity than I
[2:05:53] am I am very aware you're a human I'm
[2:05:56] very aware I'm a human there is a law of
[2:05:58] sin and death but there's also a law of
[2:06:02] life and when the human element goes out
[2:06:06] you're divided in two parts you believe
[2:06:08] Jesus was all
[2:06:09] God do you believe it was all man then
[2:06:12] there had to be a union between God and
[2:06:14] man that would allow him to be all God
[2:06:16] and all man at the same time it's called
[2:06:19] a hypostatic a hypostatic logos which is
[2:06:23] a which is a covenant between two beings
[2:06:26] that they can come together and remain
[2:06:28] the same there amen they had to invent a
[2:06:30] word nobody had a word but there's a
[2:06:33] word developed for you and I that God
[2:06:36] could develop and come together with a
[2:06:38] man and you remain a man you cry like a
[2:06:42] man you feel like a man you got fear
[2:06:44] like a man but only the inside of that
[2:06:46] man as a God as a god of Miracles as a
[2:06:50] God that can create age there's a God
[2:06:52] that can bring life because God rich in
[2:06:55] Mercy has brought power into the age
[2:06:58] that we're living in oh the prophet of
[2:07:02] God said this about you he said there
[2:07:04] will come a time that your thoughts will
[2:07:05] become your words and your words will
[2:07:07] become Miracles that's when the church
[2:07:09] will move in his
[2:07:11] power there will come a time when God
[2:07:14] will go forth in the power of His deity
[2:07:17] because deity will be revealed in human
[2:07:19] beings by the holy Spirit bringing to
[2:07:22] pass the thoughts of their
[2:07:27] minds hallelujah
[2:07:30] hallelujah oh it's going to take some
[2:07:32] Faith it's going to take more faith than
[2:07:34] any other hour it's going to take Faith
[2:07:36] to get above your Humanity it's going to
[2:07:38] take Faith to get above your troubles
[2:07:40] it's going to take Faith to get above
[2:07:42] your sins but if the word of God says it
[2:07:45] there's somebody going to believe it and
[2:07:47] God's going to manifest it through
[2:07:49] somebody
[2:07:53] let me give you let me give you some
[2:07:54] prophecy over the church there shall
[2:07:56] come to pass in the last days and I
[2:07:58] believe we're um approaching the hour
[2:08:00] now when missing limbs will be restored
[2:08:04] by the power of the
[2:08:07] Creator how many of y'all know why
[2:08:08] brother Bram said that he said that
[2:08:11] because he had just told the testimony
[2:08:14] of in the back room there was a boy with
[2:08:16] leukemia and brother Bram prayed for him
[2:08:18] and God healed him of Leukemia and
[2:08:20] brother Bram said the only that could be
[2:08:21] a healing of leukemia is God had to
[2:08:24] recreate the blood cell and cause the
[2:08:26] blood cell to be new in the body and the
[2:08:29] leukemia was pushed out and New Life
[2:08:31] came in well if God can recreate the
[2:08:34] blood cell don't you know he can
[2:08:36] activate the DNA that grows your first
[2:08:38] arm that grows your first leg and God
[2:08:41] can add limbs back if he can heal
[2:08:43] leukemia he can heal a lame body the BL
[2:08:47] come on Church the blind can see the
[2:08:50] death can hear the dumb can speak the
[2:08:53] dead can raise he is the same yesterday
[2:08:58] today and
[2:09:02] forever I said well I tell you what that
[2:09:05] might have happened back in brother
[2:09:05] bram's day well that's just updated
[2:09:07] could we I was preaching a meeting over
[2:09:10] there in Norway a few years ago and I
[2:09:12] was preaching on a on a I believe it was
[2:09:13] a Saturday night and I was preaching on
[2:09:15] the Seven Stars of Revelations the first
[2:09:17] chapter if you ain't never read it it's
[2:09:19] under the angel of Ephesus all the way
[2:09:20] to the angel a to you look up the word
[2:09:23] angel in the Greek it's called Angelos
[2:09:25] and it means messenger it's not a deity
[2:09:27] it's a human being and they were men
[2:09:30] sent from God who got
[2:09:33] messages now I'm moving fast I know but
[2:09:36] in Revelations the 10th chapter the
[2:09:37] Bible said that the in the days of the
[2:09:39] voice of that seventh one the Lan
[2:09:42] messenger in his day that the mysteries
[2:09:45] of the seven Thunders which were hid
[2:09:47] from the time of Daniel would be
[2:09:49] unveiled in that generation and what
[2:09:51] would it do but remove the symbols that
[2:09:54] was on the book when it was written so
[2:09:57] when you read the book of Ephesians you
[2:09:58] read it the way God would have
[2:10:00] originally written
[2:10:01] it my goodness time's getting away but I
[2:10:04] it won't matter it it won't mean nothing
[2:10:05] if we don't say this God thought
[2:10:08] something originally he had a thought
[2:10:11] when he revealed it to John he gave it
[2:10:13] in a symbol and John wrote it in symbol
[2:10:16] form now watch when John recorded it he
[2:10:20] said unto the angel of to seea he didn't
[2:10:22] give a name he didn't give a time he
[2:10:24] just gave an age a condition and it
[2:10:26] would be a messenger right so he was
[2:10:27] leaving symbols that's why he said White
[2:10:29] Horse and black horse and red horse and
[2:10:31] the and the dragon it was all
[2:10:34] symbology but listen what God was doing
[2:10:36] do y'all know that God has the cannon of
[2:10:38] scriptures written and no man can add
[2:10:40] anything to that Canon of
[2:10:42] scriptures so if God wanted the end time
[2:10:45] bride to get a book in the Bible how
[2:10:47] could he do it unless he would cause
[2:10:49] John to write it and he would write it
[2:10:51] in symbol form and it would go through
[2:10:53] the hands of the ages and every reformer
[2:10:57] and they would read it but they wouldn't
[2:10:58] know what it was but in the age of the
[2:11:01] seventh angel he would come from God as
[2:11:04] a Divine interpreter of the word of God
[2:11:07] and he would tell the symbols of this
[2:11:09] Bible to open up the power of the
[2:11:12] reality of God that man could come back
[2:11:15] to this true Miracle working God that's
[2:11:18] why he said unto the angel of the Le DEA
[2:11:21] that's why tonight when we look at angel
[2:11:23] under Ephesus we can say under
[2:11:25] Paul because we know the symbol has been
[2:11:28] removed we know what God was
[2:11:32] saying because it's our book it's our
[2:11:37] letter we had the keys to the answers
[2:11:41] and the seventh angel when I was
[2:11:42] preaching there in in in in Norway and I
[2:11:45] was preaching under them angels and I
[2:11:47] got down and I preached
[2:11:48] under I got all the way to amen down
[2:11:51] there to Martin and I was down there to
[2:11:53] Martin Luther and I got to John Wesley
[2:11:56] amen but you know nobody cares if you
[2:11:58] talk about Martin Luther because he's a
[2:12:00] world-renowned scholar in Germany and
[2:12:02] all the people in England they love John
[2:12:04] Wesley and they got shrines built to him
[2:12:06] but the minute you say that seven star
[2:12:09] was a man named William brandom every
[2:12:11] devil Out of Hell crawls
[2:12:13] out amen you listen to the age we're
[2:12:15] living in do you know people don't care
[2:12:18] if you quote Oh cigar smoking amen you
[2:12:21] you you quote woodro Wilson I hear
[2:12:25] preachers all the time quoting Abraham
[2:12:26] Lincoln and George Washington and they
[2:12:28] quote some uh Steven Hawkins and they
[2:12:31] quote this guy and they quote this guy
[2:12:33] but if you quote Willam brandom every
[2:12:35] devil in hell falls apart but you want
[2:12:37] to know why because there is something
[2:12:40] that has been released under that
[2:12:41] Ministry that is the casting out of the
[2:12:44] devil and it's the setting of power of
[2:12:47] the Bride of Jesus Christ something's
[2:12:51] lifting us back to the mind of God what
[2:12:54] he thought of in the
[2:12:57] beginning Jordan and I was standing
[2:12:59] there and I said and unto the angel the
[2:13:00] seventh angel is a man named William
[2:13:02] brandom there was a woman sitting in the
[2:13:03] back of my meeting she had she had
[2:13:06] actually had
[2:13:08] leukemia I didn't even know this

[2:13:48] feeling they hit me in the top of my
[2:13:50] head and went to the bottom of my feet
[2:13:53] she said brother Wayne God completely
[2:13:55] healed me of leukemia because there's
[2:13:58] healing under the message according to
[2:14:01] Malachi 4 the son of righteousness shall
[2:14:05] arise with healing in his ways he is the
[2:14:08] same yesterday today and forever he's

[3:51:09] God a time when I didn't expect a
[3:51:12] meeting I was critical I was skeptical
[3:51:16] but it was in that place that God came
[3:51:19] and went past all my skepticism and
[3:51:21] criticism and he saved me and God can do
[3:51:25] that for us he can do it for you he can
[3:51:27] do it for your children your
