[10:40] just read out of Matthew the 24th
[10:42] chapter and the 28th verse and and I'll
[10:44] allow you to be seated the Bible says
[10:46] for wheresoever the carcass is there
[10:48] will the Eagles be gathered together and
[10:51] the believer say amen amen you can have
[10:54] your seats tonight and I want to speak
[10:56] on this subject what is the car us and
[10:59] who are the Eagles and I want to also
[11:02] read out of First Kings in the 17th
[11:04] chapter and we're going to read out of
[11:05] the eth verse and just you don't have to
[11:08] turn there but I'll read it the Bible
[11:09] says and the word of the Lord came unto
[11:11] him saying arise and get thee to zerath
[11:15] which belongeth to zidon and dwell there
[11:17] for behold I have commanded a widow
[11:19] woman here to sustain thee amen we'll
[11:22] just ask the Lord to add his Blessing to
[11:24] the word that is read tonight but I want
[11:26] to speak on this what is the carcass and
[11:28] who are The Eagles I know that uh we
[11:31] read this scripture out of out of First
[11:33] Kings and you see that the Lord uh has
[11:36] put a calling upon Elijah's life and how
[11:38] many's familiar with the story of when
[11:40] he called Elijah out of uh or into
[11:43] zerath and here he had put a an
[11:45] instruction on how many's familiar with
[11:47] the story there couldn't be more than
[11:48] there's got to be more than one person
[11:49] y'all say Amen my my vision ain't great
[11:52] amen it's hard to see Hands I do better
[11:54] with the word so uh plus I know what the
[11:56] prophet said he said the Holy Ghost
[11:58] backs the word of God with with the amen
[12:01] God bless you amen but we uh but the but
[12:04] the the Bible says I commanded a widow
[12:06] woman there to sustain thee and the Lord
[12:09] has called him when he called Elijah out
[12:11] of this place of where he was and here
[12:12] he was calling him uh into into this
[12:15] place we realize that this word uh
[12:17] starts it starts as as the word is
[12:20] coming to Elijah and Elijah is at the
[12:23] brook cherith and he is waiting he is
[12:25] there and he is being uh taken care of
[12:28] by God and he had he had been there as a
[12:30] refuge of from a drought or or from a
[12:33] famine and uh you remember the story as
[12:35] Elijah had prophesied un Ahab that he
[12:37] said there would come no DW or there
[12:39] will come no rain in the land and and
[12:41] and when when Elijah had given this word
[12:43] to Ahab and given this uh uh this
[12:46] judgment from God upon the land and uh
[12:49] that there would be no there would be no
[12:50] place a sustaining place but uh but when
[12:53] God brought this and he brought this
[12:55] curse or this famine or what you would
[12:56] call it upon the land but whenever it
[12:58] came to Elijah the Bible says but God
[13:00] had ordered him to a place that he would
[13:02] be sustained and so uh even in the midst
[13:05] of the famine that he would call and
[13:06] even the there would be no DW there'd be
[13:08] no rain but uh God had called him to
[13:10] This Little Brook that was over near the
[13:12] river of Jordan and and the Lord had
[13:14] told him he said I've commanded Ravens
[13:16] to feed you uh and here so and I've
[13:19] commanded uh and and this Brook will be
[13:21] a place to sustain you and so uh when
[13:24] Elijah was sitting by the Brook he was
[13:26] doing he was in the will of God it was a
[13:28] place that God had called him to and so
[13:30] here we find out that the Bible tell us
[13:32] that Elijah being a man of God he had
[13:34] gone to the brook he had obeyed the word
[13:35] of the Lord he was he was fulfilling
[13:37] what God had told him to do and he was
[13:39] satisfied from the water and the Ravens
[13:41] came and the Ravens fed him and and and
[13:43] I I don't know how long he was there the
[13:45] Bible don't really tell us how long he
[13:46] said I know the famine had gone on for
[13:48] three and a half or four years that had
[13:50] happened in that time so so somewhere in
[13:53] the middle of this famine or or this
[13:54] drought that had Came Upon Israel uh the
[13:57] the brook had finally came to a place
[13:59] that it was dried up and I thought you
[14:01] know I wonder what had gone through
[14:03] Elijah's mind when he was sitting there
[14:05] after the word of the Lord had came to
[14:06] him and told him you go to the brook and
[14:08] and the Ravens are going to feed you and
[14:10] here Elijah was sitting and brother
[14:11] marah as many day after day he'd get up
[14:13] and he would drink water out of the
[14:15] brook and a raven would come by and a
[14:16] raven would feed him and the next day
[14:18] he'd get up he'd drink water out of the
[14:20] brook and the Raven would come by and
[14:21] the Ravens would would bring him food
[14:23] and and day after day it had gone on but
[14:26] one morning when Elijah woke up he
[14:28] looked down and the brook no longer had
[14:30] water in it I thought I wonder what went
[14:32] through this man of God's mind as he was
[14:34] sitting here and and Brother David he
[14:35] thought well this is where God had sent
[14:37] me and this is I know I was following
[14:39] the word of the Lord and but as he came
[14:40] by the Brook but one morning he gets in
[14:42] the Brooks no longer producing water
[14:44] there's no water coming down the stream
[14:46] and I thought isn't it something that
[14:47] the brook dried up there wasn't going to
[14:49] be no more Ravens that would bring any
[14:51] food to feed him but what he did have is
[14:53] whenever the water stopped and there was
[14:55] there may not have been no raven come by
[14:56] but he got another word from the Lord
[14:58] see and the Lord said now go down to
[15:00] zerath for I have commanded a widow
[15:03] woman there to sustain you I thought you
[15:05] know it doesn't matter what what what
[15:07] what the old word was or what the
[15:08] previous instruction that God had given
[15:10] to Elijah what Elijah could have looked
[15:13] at that and said but you know what I
[15:14] have a word from the Lord that he gave
[15:16] me a few years ago and he told me to
[15:17] come right here to this place and I
[15:19] would be sustained and and Elijah could
[15:21] have took that and he could have he
[15:22] could have said well I'm not going to
[15:23] follow this new word of the Lord I'm
[15:25] just going to take the old word that God
[15:26] had spoke to me I'm just going to I'm
[15:28] just going to live by that and he could
[15:29] have fought and brother Mark he could
[15:30] have tried to dig a well but there had
[15:32] never been any water and he he could
[15:34] have he could have tried to train Ravens
[15:35] but they never went out and found food
[15:37] because the word of the Lord had called
[15:39] him to this other place and so as God be
[15:41] to call him and I and you you know how
[15:43] Elijah here he was a man that was
[15:45] followed he would follow the word of God
[15:47] and brother Joe he went down and the
[15:48] Bible said as he went down into the
[15:50] place brother said Elijah being a
[15:52] prophet of God and maybe the Lord had
[15:54] said it like this go down into the City
[15:56] and keep walking until you find a woman
[15:58] that had to sticks in her hand and she's
[16:00] going to be there to feed you he said
[16:01] see because when he went down he was he
[16:04] was looking for what God had showed him
[16:06] he said that's what God does God does
[16:08] things that are real so he wasn't
[16:09] looking for some sign or something in
[16:11] the sky but God him being a prophet of
[16:13] God and and having a vision no doubt
[16:15] from God as he went down into this place
[16:17] and and he we go down he would see he he
[16:19] would say God sent him down there and as
[16:21] he went down to the place he said I'm
[16:22] going to send you there and there's a
[16:23] woman that's going to feed you and she
[16:25] may not have nothing in her house but
[16:27] she's going to be able to feed you and
[16:29] and the Bible says as he went down and
[16:31] and you know how the story goes I love
[16:32] how brother Bram dramatizes he said he
[16:34] went down and as he walking along
[16:36] finally he comes across this lady that
[16:38] has these two sticks in her hand and he
[16:40] he seen the woman packing the sticks and
[16:42] said well that must be her and so he he
[16:44] calls out to catch her attention and he
[16:46] says woman would you fetch me a little
[16:48] water and you know the story the Bible
[16:50] says she said well well well well I I'll
[16:52] certainly go to do it and as she turned
[16:54] to do it he then he also says to her but
[16:57] also bring me a little more of bread in
[17:00] your hand and and and brother B said you
[17:02] know notice Elijah having seen a vision
[17:04] knowing the condition that she already
[17:06] had he said but as she as she begin to
[17:08] go she said as the Lord liveth he she
[17:11] was being a Believer she said as the
[17:13] Lord liveth I've only got a handful of
[17:15] meal and just a spoonful of oil and I've
[17:18] already prepared and I've dressed it and
[17:19] I've got it ready and I'm going to take
[17:21] these two sticks and make a little cake
[17:23] and a fire and and and make a cake for
[17:25] my me and my son and we're going to eat
[17:27] it and at the end of that meal we're not
[17:28] going have nothing else to eat at the
[17:30] end of that meal we're just going to be
[17:31] out in the wilderness and we're going to
[17:33] die and that that's all that we have
[17:34] left and brother man said but notice in
[17:36] this part of this story here comes a
[17:39] great lesson he said Elijah said unto
[17:42] her well go bake me a cake first see and
[17:45] then notice he said what is it it's a
[17:47] lesson that we learn and that lesson is
[17:49] seek you first the kingdom of God and
[17:52] his righteousness so Elijah calls to her
[17:55] he said you go bake me one first and you
[17:57] you know I could just see that little a
[17:59] woman brother Travis as she proceeded to
[18:01] do what what Elijah had ordered her to
[18:03] do as she turned around and she began to
[18:05] make preparation I I don't believe that
[18:07] she had that she argued with him about
[18:09] it I believe in her heart that she had
[18:11] already prepared to do that very thing
[18:13] he said you go bake me a cake first and
[18:15] something in her said I'll go do just
[18:17] that I don't know how I'm going to
[18:18] survive I don't know how we're going to
[18:20] make it but there's something about this
[18:22] man that God had sent to my house I I
[18:24] don't know where this guy came from he
[18:25] comes stomping out of the Wilderness but
[18:27] there was there was some kind of
[18:28] anointing around Elijah's life that
[18:31] caused her whenever he told her to go
[18:33] bake her a cake that that that it caused
[18:35] her to be obedient to the call of God
[18:37] and and so she when she turns around and
[18:40] she and she makes an effort to do it and
[18:41] she goes to proceed to do it and maybe
[18:43] she's wondering in her house in her
[18:45] heart who is this and what's going on
[18:48] and all of a sudden the prophet of God
[18:49] says she heard that comforting word that
[18:52] always Comforts us for thus sayeth the
[18:55] Lord the barrel will not be empty nor
[18:58] the cruise run dry my isn't it a
[19:00] comforting word to hear for the Bride of
[19:02] Jesus Christ thus sayeth the Lord you
[19:04] know brother Morgan when you hear those
[19:06] words thus sayeth the Lord you no longer
[19:08] have to worry when you hear thus sayeth
[19:10] the Lord you don't have to wonder or
[19:12] wonder where it came from or what the
[19:14] outcome is going to be but she heard
[19:16] that comforting word thus sayeth the
[19:18] Lord the barrel will not be empty nor
[19:20] the cruise run dry until the day that
[19:23] God sends rain upon the Earth and you
[19:25] know what the Bible tells us how many
[19:26] knows the end of the story you know what
[19:28] she done she made him a cake she came
[19:30] out and fed him and then the Bible says
[19:32] that until the famine left the land her
[19:34] her meal Barrel never ran dry her oil
[19:37] her Cruise of oil it never ran dry the
[19:40] neighbors around they ran out of oil
[19:42] they ran out of meal but that little
[19:44] woman's cupboard it was never empty
[19:46] every morning when she went in she could
[19:48] make how many cakes she desired how many
[19:50] her heart's desire Brother David she
[19:52] could eat breakfast she could eat lunch
[19:54] she could eat dinner she could feed her
[19:56] son and it never run out until the end
[19:59] of the famine in the land let me tell
[20:01] you something friends about this story
[20:03] as long as the prophet of God was at the
[20:05] brook The Raven had food to eat also
[20:09] this is something I saw in this today I
[20:10] thought it was so wonderful and as long
[20:12] as the prophet of God was at the Widow's
[20:14] house I'm not sure what happened to the
[20:16] Ravens after the prophet left the brook
[20:18] but I know one thing when he entered
[20:20] into the Widow's house she had food to
[20:22] eat too let me tell you friends the same
[20:24] thing that the prophet was feeding on
[20:26] the widow woman ate the same thing he
[20:29] fed on her son ate the same manner he
[20:31] was eating on was the same manner that
[20:33] satisfied her I know sometimes it don't
[20:35] look like it's going to work out
[20:37] sometimes it looks like because of
[20:39] circumstance we're at the end of the
[20:40] road but brother man said what was it he
[20:42] said in that very dark and crucial
[20:44] moment there come he said but God is
[20:47] always on the scene in your dark and
[20:49] crucial moments God is on the scene how
[20:52] many say amen he said if you're sure
[20:54] that it's God and you've repented your
[20:56] sins and if you met God's requirement
[20:58] then you can can be sure that God will
[20:59] keep his promise if men and women could
[21:02] only realize that that God is obligated
[21:04] to keep his promise if youve met his
[21:06] requirements and you've confessed your
[21:08] sins and you've made your wrongs right
[21:10] and you've done everything God has
[21:12] required you to do then you hold on to
[21:14] God and you've got to see daylight he's
[21:17] got to bring it through you just hold on
[21:19] to God in that dark crucial hour you
[21:21] don't worry in the middle of that
[21:22] Darkness Daylight's going to come in the
[21:25] middle of coldness brother Mah there's a
[21:26] fire that's going to burn in the middle
[21:28] of a famine there's food there to eat oh
[21:31] all through the Bible I can find places
[21:33] where God intervenes can you let me
[21:35] preach just a minute all through the
[21:37] scripture I find places where God
[21:39] intervenes we see that that sometimes we
[21:41] get to a place where we feel like we're
[21:43] forsaken sometimes you feel you you get
[21:45] discouraged and your and your faith gets
[21:47] depleted and you don't and you feel you
[21:49] just completely given up but God
[21:51] constantly reminds us in the scripture
[21:53] that that that there's never that he'll
[21:56] that to never let your place discourage
[21:58] you never let where you are discourage
[22:01] you as being a Believer I know sometimes
[22:03] it's so easy to look around us and
[22:05] friends I'm not going to ask you to look
[22:06] around but sometimes whenever you look
[22:08] around it's very discouraging to see the
[22:10] the the place that you're in and the the
[22:12] things that are going on around you and
[22:13] the and the things that are happening in
[22:15] your house but here God reminds us never
[22:17] let your place be a discouragement to
[22:19] you he tells us that some things are
[22:22] just out of your control but let me tell
[22:24] you friends it doesn't matter what what
[22:25] your situation is when it may be out of
[22:28] your control but it's never out of God's
[22:30] control it doesn't matter what your
[22:31] situation is the Bible tells us that you
[22:34] can always find a place where God has
[22:36] intervene here's what happened with this
[22:38] woman brother brother uh Xavier when
[22:40] this woman was starving and she was
[22:41] about she was about on her last meal
[22:44] that God sent Elijah to her house to
[22:45] make sure meal bear was full when the
[22:47] three three Hebrew children were thrown
[22:49] in a fiery furnace brother Jared God
[22:52] came down in the furnace where they were
[22:53] don't ever let your place cause
[22:55] discouragement to come to your life the
[22:57] situation you're in it don't Define you
[23:01] it a it ain't your end result it it
[23:03] ain't the the place where you're just
[23:04] going to have to live the rest of your
[23:05] life and deal with it and cope with it
[23:07] but in every situation God has sent
[23:10] somebody to intervene oh friends you go
[23:13] through the Bible you find there was a
[23:14] lame man at the pool of Bethesda that
[23:16] couldn't get his way to his healing but
[23:18] just because he couldn't get there don't
[23:20] mean that God couldn't find him and
[23:22] Jesus walked right up to where he was he
[23:23] said why don't you receive your healing
[23:25] he said every time I try to some man
[23:27] gets in away he said but your healing is
[23:30] here everywhere don't let your place be
[23:33] a discouragement to you at the gate
[23:35] beautiful there was a man that Peter and
[23:36] John went by and they healed him in his
[23:38] place at a at Gaza there was an
[23:40] Ethiopian unic that was that was looking
[23:43] for answers and and God came by and gave
[23:45] him an answer there was a woman in
[23:46] Samaria that was in a mixed up marriage
[23:49] and Jesus came by and he met her at a
[23:51] well friends it don't matter what the
[23:52] place it don't matter how big or how
[23:54] little it is Peter was just having a bad
[23:56] day at work he wasn't catching any fish
[23:58] but Jesus came out he said throw your
[24:00] net on the other side it don't matter if
[24:02] it's a big problem if it's a a small
[24:05] problem a big thing or a little thing
[24:07] but your circumstances don't control you
[24:09] hello somebody and let me tell you this
[24:12] they certainly don't control God
[24:15] either so if it's good God's in control
[24:19] in the bad time God's in control when
[24:21] you're up God's in control when you're
[24:24] down God's in control when you're on a
[24:26] mountain God's in control when you're in
[24:27] a valley God's in control when whether
[24:30] you're rich God's in control whether
[24:32] you're poor God's in control I think we
[24:35] ought to have what Paul said he said he
[24:37] said now that I speak in respect of of
[24:40] want for I have learned he said
[24:42] whatsoever stay I in therewith to be
[24:45] content in other words he said I know I
[24:47] know how to be abased and I know how to
[24:50] abound this is Apostle Paul he said
[24:52] everywhere in all things I'm instructed
[24:53] both to be full and to be hungry both to
[24:55] abound and to suffer need but I can do
[24:58] all things can I read that out of an
[25:00] amplified Bible you know I love to do it
[25:02] he said I have learned to be content
[25:04] regardless of my
[25:06] circumstances I've learned to be content
[25:08] in any and every circumstance I have
[25:10] learned the secret of facing life
[25:12] whether I'm wellfed or even whether I'm
[25:14] hungry whether having an abundance or
[25:16] whether being in need I can do all
[25:19] things that God has called me to do
[25:21] through Christ who gives me strength
[25:23] friends let me tell you we're not fair
[25:25] weather Christians we don't just serve
[25:27] God on on sunny days but we've been
[25:29] built on a firm foundation we're a body
[25:32] of Believers that has built been built
[25:34] on a foundation of Faith you know what
[25:36] brother Mark you know what that means
[25:37] that regardless of the circumstances we
[25:39] just press on regardless of the
[25:41] situation we press on regardless the
[25:44] Bible said though a thousand far 10,000
[25:46] at my right hand still yet I'm going to
[25:48] serve the Lord I I'm going to keep
[25:50] pressing the battle why because because
[25:52] God called me and I can do all things
[25:54] through Christ who gives me strength
[25:57] Paul said I have learned
[25:58] in other words I have been taught by
[26:00] circumstance to wait on God and wait on
[26:03] his word now let me tell you this
[26:05] friends I I know sometimes the people
[26:07] don't want you to wait you know
[26:09] sometimes people get impatient they you
[26:11] know and I talk to people all the time
[26:13] about situations and everybody that that
[26:15] that most of the time they'll you know
[26:16] they tell you the problem then tell you
[26:17] how to fix it but you know you know
[26:20] sometimes you just got to wait on the
[26:21] Lord sometimes is you know it seems like
[26:23] to be the theme the last few Services
[26:25] every brother that comes up and preaches
[26:26] says something about it you know some
[26:28] times you just have to wait on God and
[26:30] you you have to let let let let God Work
[26:32] how God works and you know we we think
[26:34] we ought to do it now and fix it right
[26:36] now and and you know you know brother
[26:38] Matt if you'll go tell them that'll well
[26:40] you'll straighten it right out but
[26:41] friends you realize that ain't just the
[26:42] way it works let me tell I'm going to
[26:44] give you a free poem I just made it up
[26:45] if the pastor's in a hurry then the
[26:47] church better
[26:48] worry you wait on the Lord why aren't we
[26:51] waiting on God because we don't want to
[26:53] get in trouble we wait upon the Lord we
[26:56] so so when the circumstan it's bad the
[26:58] Bible would tell us brother Mark we wait
[27:00] on God we wait on the Lord here's what
[27:02] Isaiah said he said they that wait upon
[27:04] the Lord shall renew their strength they
[27:06] shall Mount up with wings as eagles they
[27:08] shall run and not be weary they shall
[27:11] walk and not faint you said well brother
[27:12] man how do you wait on the lord well let
[27:14] me tell you you wait on the word let me
[27:17] tell you the word to waiting on the Lord
[27:18] is waiting on a word from the lord it's
[27:21] it's a waiting on the on on a word
[27:23] leading or a word direction you remember
[27:25] a few weeks ago I preached a message on
[27:27] the three kings and how that they had
[27:28] gone out the king of Edom and of Judah
[27:31] and of Israel and how how they had gone
[27:33] out and they took the compass and the
[27:34] compass LED them to their death here
[27:36] they they had no uh water for their
[27:38] cattle or their army but remember when
[27:40] they got in this place one of the men
[27:42] said but is there not here a prophet of
[27:44] the Lord that we may inquire of the Lord
[27:46] by him and one of the one of the
[27:48] servants said well there's a man by the
[27:49] name of Elisha he he's a prophet of God
[27:52] he poured water over the hands of Elijah
[27:54] and but you notice there was a reason
[27:56] there was a reason why that they would
[27:58] hear Elisha you said well what was it
[27:59] that would cause him to want to hear
[28:01] what Elisha said well here he what
[28:03] Jehoshaphat said about him he said
[28:05] because the word of the Lord is with him
[28:08] so why would they listen to Elisha it
[28:10] was because they were waiting on a word
[28:12] from the Lord the word of the Lord is
[28:15] with them and when they realized they
[28:16] were in trouble they said let's inquire
[28:18] of God in other words we need a word
[28:20] from the Lord on this so the call for a
[28:22] prophet I know some people look at it as
[28:24] a strange thing here these men were
[28:26] calling upon a prophet today if you told
[28:28] people well let's see what a prophet
[28:30] said about it they look at you like you
[28:31] have two heads cuz well why would you
[28:33] call upon a prophet but it wasn't that
[28:34] they were just looking for a prophet but
[28:36] they called upon a prophet because they
[28:39] were really looking for a word from God
[28:41] so the call upon a prophet of God is
[28:43] really to uh call upon the word of God
[28:46] we're looking for a word from the Lord
[28:47] is there somebody here that can give us
[28:49] a word leading is there somebody here
[28:51] that can give us a leading of the word
[28:53] of the Lord so so you could say it like
[28:55] this that waiting on the Lord Brother
[28:56] The Mark is waiting for a leading of the
[28:59] word of God so to wait upon the Lord is
[29:02] waiting for the word to lead you it's
[29:04] waiting for the word to guide you it's
[29:06] waiting for something to be said that
[29:08] pertained to that matter and matter of
[29:09] fact brother Mar said like this he said
[29:11] any man that's a Christian he will be
[29:13] led by the word of God he won't be led
[29:17] by men he won't be led uh by by all
[29:19] these things and but he'll be led by the
[29:21] word of God and listen Isaiah said and
[29:23] they that wait upon the Lord they'll
[29:25] Mount up with wings as Eagles I thought
[29:28] what a powerful type that Isaiah used
[29:30] they'll Mount up with wings as Eagles
[29:32] you realize that the Bible would tell us
[29:35] there's there the Bible actually types
[29:37] many different groups of people as Birds
[29:40] I don't have time I can see on a
[29:41] Wednesday night to go through all this
[29:43] but I can I can get the the basis of it
[29:45] but in the Bible we find clean birds and
[29:47] unclean Birds there's many different
[29:49] families of birds there's bird types and
[29:51] the Bible would talk about quail and how
[29:53] how it was good for food and then you
[29:55] know we find the you know the different
[29:57] families that all the birds are in
[29:58] there's water foul there's short which
[29:59] Morgan loves they well they sure love to
[30:01] go after the water foul and when it's in
[30:03] season and then and then there's short
[30:05] birds and and then and then there there
[30:07] there's the dove family which was a type
[30:09] of the Holy Ghost in the scripture and
[30:11] you you'll find out it ain't only in the
[30:12] Bible but brother Mark but even in
[30:14] society we find that that that birds are
[30:17] used to type classes of people or
[30:19] different people and and you know I I
[30:21] got to think about that it's kind of
[30:22] humorous but you know we we call some
[30:24] people nightowl you know that's actually
[30:25] a family of bird and so that well that
[30:28] group well well that's just an night out
[30:29] what it means is I'm going to get myself
[30:31] in trouble but but it's those kind of
[30:33] people that they don't like the light so
[30:35] they just stay around in the darkness
[30:36] and they they don't want nothing to do
[30:38] with the light they just want fellowship
[30:39] with all the darkness and all the all
[30:41] the rest of things that move around in
[30:42] the middle of the night and so so it's
[30:44] just a family of birds and you know
[30:46] there's other birds there there's one
[30:47] called the cuckoo bird I don't think I
[30:49] need to explain it but I met some of
[30:51] them there there's a family called the
[30:52] loons We call we we made up a word about
[30:55] people going to the Looney Bin it was
[30:57] after a family of bir
[30:58] it it was the loons and you know there
[31:00] then then there's the parrot family Oh
[31:02] Glory oh boy there's the parrot family
[31:04] this is all you get out of them it don't
[31:06] they they hear gossip and it comes in
[31:08] one ear and right out the mouth it ain't
[31:10] it ain't in one ear and out the other
[31:12] it's in the ear and out the mouth they
[31:13] can't even get off the phone before
[31:14] they're texting somebody else and
[31:16] telling them what they heard it's the
[31:18] parrot family they're just Birds there's
[31:20] all kinds of birds there's Fish Eaters
[31:22] there's seed eaters there's birds of
[31:24] prey there's meat eaters but I'm Morgan
[31:26] but then there's an eagle
[31:28] e then there was an eagle see this Eagle
[31:33] is a bird that comes in its own class
[31:35] but jar there ain't no other bird the
[31:37] characteristic of an eagle is so
[31:38] Superior to that of any other bird
[31:41] brother Aon you think about a an eagle
[31:43] the to describe an eagle an eagle is a
[31:46] strong bird even the scientists whenever
[31:48] they would when they would describe the
[31:50] the character of an eagle they would say
[31:52] that an eagle is a Fearless bird in
[31:54] other word he is so he is so set on his
[31:57] resolve
[31:58] that that you couldn't scare them off
[32:00] they if a if an eagle would fly off it's
[32:02] not even out of fear it's it's to it's
[32:04] to get to a better position to be able
[32:06] to fulfill what his will is anyway there
[32:09] there's just something about an eagle
[32:10] he's a Fearless bird here's a bird that
[32:12] that is focused it's a bird that that
[32:15] has Vision above any other bird brother
[32:17] Bobby an eagle they they say an eagle
[32:19] can see a rabbit from three miles away
[32:22] he can spot a rabbit hopping in a field
[32:23] three miles up in the heavens and find
[32:25] his prey he's got greater Vision than
[32:27] any bird an eagle he he's got this a
[32:31] great wingspan and you know there
[32:32] there's birds that's bigger than an
[32:33] eagle but the problem is they just got
[32:35] funny legs and little short wings and
[32:38] they they they run real fast but they
[32:39] can't fly but an eagle he's got it all
[32:42] but a Morgan he he's the highest flyer
[32:44] he's got a the greatest wingspan he he
[32:47] and there's something about an eagle
[32:48] that whenever a storm comes and and all
[32:51] the other birds when a storm comes
[32:52] they'll find refuge and they'll burrow
[32:54] up in little thickets and they'll find
[32:56] something that they can they can find go
[32:57] to the ground do you ever notice in a
[32:59] great storm that bird ain't hanging out
[33:00] there in the top of a tree but they go
[33:02] into the thickest they they they become
[33:05] they become Earthbound Birds because
[33:07] they're trying to find protection from a
[33:09] storm but an eagle does exactly the
[33:11] opposite when the storm and the winds
[33:13] begin to blow the eagle will set his
[33:15] wings and allow the winds from the storm
[33:17] to push him to a higher height until he
[33:19] can rise above the very storm that's
[33:21] taking every bird to the ground there's
[33:24] a there's a characteristic about an
[33:26] eagle he's different than any other bird
[33:29] and I thought isn't it something that
[33:31] the Bible he would say you would rise up
[33:33] on the wings as an eagle so we find out
[33:35] in the Book of Revelation as it speaks
[33:37] of the world system today and you you
[33:39] see that there's so many different types
[33:40] of birds that was used you'll find that
[33:42] that that here as it talks about the
[33:44] church world and the things that people
[33:46] go God this I'm I'm gonna get too deep
[33:48] before I start but but but they but how
[33:50] that that that old Babylon church or
[33:53] that old Harlot church we find in the
[33:54] Book of Revelation that they would allow
[33:56] anything to worship this is the world
[33:58] that we live in today there's all kinds
[34:00] of things that's being fed there's all
[34:02] kinds of of places to go feed there's
[34:04] all kinds of birds that's going to all
[34:06] kinds of buildings and they're looking
[34:07] for all kinds of food something that'll
[34:09] satisfy their their taste but you
[34:11] realize but every bird has a different
[34:13] taste for different things and the Bible
[34:15] would tell us in the end time there
[34:17] would be these great churches and that
[34:18] that on nicet and spirit would rise up
[34:20] as the mother of all of them and the
[34:22] priest would would conquer the people of
[34:24] God and they would put a spirit of
[34:26] Oppression on them it's no wonder that a
[34:28] holy ghost filed preacher can't stand to
[34:30] see a people oppressed it's no wonder
[34:32] that a holy ghost filed preacher can't
[34:34] stand to see people tied down and not
[34:36] able to worship God and not able to lift
[34:38] their hands and not able to praise God
[34:40] and say Amen because the oppression
[34:42] didn't come from God it come from the
[34:44] devil and here this Spirit or this Old
[34:47] nickan Demon would come and to oppress
[34:49] the people of God in other words it
[34:52] would it would conquer the leoty and
[34:53] they they they build all kinds of
[34:55] there's all kinds of sanctuaries for
[34:56] birds to feed on but Brother David you
[34:59] know but there's some that they don't
[35:00] they don't believe in sanctification
[35:02] there's some they don't believe in
[35:03] Holiness there's some they preach for
[35:05] fame and they preach for money there's
[35:07] all kinds of sanctuary and there's all
[35:09] kinds of birds but listen what the Bible
[35:12] said in the end time in Revelations the
[35:14] 18th chapter John said after these
[35:16] things I saw another Angel come from
[35:18] Heaven having great power and the Earth
[35:20] was lightened with his glory and he
[35:22] cried mightily with a strong voice
[35:24] saying Babylon the greatest Fallen is
[35:26] fallen and is become the habitation of
[35:29] devils and the hold of every foul Spirit
[35:32] and the cage of every unclean and
[35:34] hateful bird for all nations have drunk
[35:36] of the wine of the wrath of her
[35:38] fornication and the kings of the Earth
[35:40] have committed fornication with her and
[35:42] the merchants of the Earth are waxed
[35:43] Rich through the abundance of her
[35:44] Delicacies and I heard another voice
[35:46] from Heaven saying come out of her my
[35:50] people be you not partakers of her sins
[35:54] that you receive not of her plagues be
[35:57] not partakers of her sins that you
[36:00] receive not of her plagues you realize
[36:02] this word partake when you look the word
[36:04] partake up the primary definition of the
[36:06] word partake it means to eat or to drink
[36:10] so here the Bible tells us be not
[36:12] partakers in other words don't eat what
[36:14] they're
[36:15] eating don't drink what they're drinking
[36:18] but Mar because if you'll eat if you'll
[36:20] partake of it then you'll receive of her
[36:22] plagues I thought my ain't it something
[36:24] there's many birds that are feeding on
[36:27] many things
[36:28] but then there's the
[36:29] eagle this Eagle for the David is not
[36:32] searching for some old dead food but the
[36:36] eagle is a type of bird that eats on
[36:38] Fresh kill brother Morgan it's looking
[36:40] for fresh Mana it's not looking for
[36:43] something that that's been handed down
[36:45] through 14 generations of of some
[36:47] denominational father that created some
[36:49] system and now here we are just
[36:51] following what they what they all vote
[36:53] on but it's looking but but he's looking
[36:54] for fresh Mana see some some birds they
[36:57] they'll eat on a on that old
[36:59] denominational table and they're I know
[37:01] this some people this ain't popular
[37:02] preaching in the world today but but you
[37:04] realize that they're feeding on a church
[37:05] rather than the word of God but but when
[37:08] you re when you feed on the church here
[37:10] what the Bible says is that you'll
[37:11] receive the plague that comes with what
[37:13] you're feeding on but let me tell you
[37:15] something I've got good news for you
[37:16] tonight that the eagle is not feeding on
[37:19] some denominational thing but the eagle
[37:21] is feeding on the on the Mana from
[37:23] almighty God let me tell you that system
[37:26] is not a feeding ground for the Eagles
[37:28] so after a little oh I know let me tell
[37:30] you something about them Eagles after a
[37:32] little while something has to happen to
[37:34] cause that eagle to go to somewhere else
[37:36] to feed and the question answers
[37:39] 1964 brother b gets this question where
[37:43] the the Matthew
[37:44] 24:28 it says wheresoever the carcass is
[37:47] there will the Eagles be gathered
[37:48] together and the person writes the
[37:50] question who is the carcass and who were
[37:52] the Eagles but said well that's a good
[37:55] question he said there's nothing wrong
[37:57] with that
[37:57] he said what is the carcass the carcass
[37:59] is what the Eagles feed on and the eagle
[38:02] think of it the eagle is considered in
[38:04] the Bible to be a prophet so think of
[38:06] the Prophet as an eagle you see he said
[38:08] see what is the carcass that they feed
[38:10] on the carcass is the word so you see
[38:13] the prophet would feed upon the word of
[38:16] God is there something here he says see
[38:18] God calls himself an eagle then if God's
[38:20] an eagle what are we we're eaglets we're
[38:22] the Believers see so wherever the word
[38:25] is the true nature of the bird will show
[38:27] it self say see an eagle which wants
[38:30] fresh meat he must have his fresh meat
[38:32] he's not a buzzard he's an eagle you
[38:34] can't give no denominational stuff to
[38:36] him he's got to have Eagle food that's
[38:38] the freshest of the meat it ain't what
[38:40] Moses done it ain't something for Martin
[38:42] Luther's message it ain't something from
[38:44] a Catholic Church it ain't something
[38:45] from a Baptist somewhere it ain't
[38:47] something that was Ted by John Smith or
[38:49] John Wesley or Calvin or Knox or or or
[38:52] any of these Great Men of God said but
[38:54] what the eagle has to have is God's word
[38:56] for right now it's what God does today
[38:59] that's what she's looking for the eagle
[39:01] is going to feed on Fresh Meat she's
[39:03] looking for fresh Mana she's looking on
[39:05] on the fresh kill of the word of
[39:09] God he said that's the part he said
[39:12] right now the meat that's killed for
[39:13] this day that's the part of Christ that
[39:15] died to make this word be confirmed
[39:17] that's what they eat on the part of
[39:20] Christ that died to make his word
[39:22] confirmed let me tell you that same
[39:24] carcass that God would send to feed the
[39:26] prophet is the same carcass that the
[39:28] Believers are feeding on today can you
[39:29] turn this down up here he says see and I
[39:31] notice the same carcass that the prophet
[39:33] fed on is the same carcass that the
[39:35] Believers fed on I thought my isn't it
[39:37] something The Raven fed it was it was a
[39:40] raven that was feeding an eagle you ever
[39:42] thought it was a raven that was feeding
[39:44] an eagle give it give a little more back
[39:46] but but you realize that until God
[39:48] called him down to minister to that
[39:50] Gentile woman I thought what a beautiful
[39:52] type that this was that here the brook
[39:54] had dried up and it went to a it went to
[39:56] a g woman and she heard she heard these
[39:59] words thus sayeth the Lord and and
[40:02] brother Jared whenever she heard that
[40:03] she obeyed the voice of Elijah and then
[40:06] her obedience it gave Elijah life so
[40:09] here a woman as she was sitting in this
[40:11] place and I thought man this is such a
[40:13] beautiful time here here that it all
[40:15] that it all dried up and after it had
[40:17] dried up and it had brought her to this
[40:19] place then then here she comes and this
[40:21] Gentile woman and she hears Elijah and
[40:23] he gives her thus sayith the Lord she
[40:25] obeys his voice and you realize what
[40:27] gave him life was her obedience to his
[40:30] voice and as she heard it and as as as
[40:33] life was was given into him his word
[40:36] that he spoke caused her family to be
[40:38] fed and it caused her family to live I
[40:40] thought my isn't it something there was
[40:42] a spirit in her that gave life to the
[40:45] word of God there was a spirit in her
[40:47] that gave life to the voice of Elijah he
[40:50] came out he said thus sayith the Lord
[40:52] and the spirit in her is what gave it
[40:54] life in order that she could be fed but
[40:57] says see C- denominations they can never
[41:00] bring life to the word of God because it
[41:02] brings life it'll never bring life out
[41:05] of their denomination he said but the
[41:07] Holy Spirit does it gives life to the
[41:10] word see there was something in her that
[41:12] give life to God's word there was
[41:15] something in her that caused that caused
[41:17] it to live there was something in her
[41:19] you realize that Elijah couldn't sustain
[41:21] her if that thing that was inside of her
[41:23] couldn't have caused her to be obedient
[41:25] to the word but something in her gave
[41:26] life to to the word Oh I thought my
[41:28] isn't it something that before Elijah
[41:31] she was in a famine before Elijah came
[41:33] she was in a drought brother Jared but
[41:35] when she received thus sayeth the Lord
[41:38] she came out of the famine and she came
[41:40] out of the drought when she received
[41:42] thus sayeth the Lord it gave life to the
[41:44] word and the word that she gave life to
[41:46] sustained her to the end of the famine
[41:49] oh my I think it's something to think of
[41:51] it today that that's the call that God
[41:53] has given us in this hour he said come
[41:55] out of her by people you're not a part
[41:58] of the unclean bird you're not a hateful
[42:00] bird but it's an a call for the eagle to
[42:03] come out of her let me tell you friends
[42:05] the eagle ain't sitting around feeding
[42:07] on some Rogue kill anymore well you know
[42:09] sometime go I I used to get I I used to
[42:12] be discouraged I remember when I was a
[42:13] young man and you know we got to talk
[42:15] about them Eagles all the time and how
[42:16] they fed on Fresh mana and some little
[42:18] smart OT come to the church one time and
[42:20] said well I'll tell you what I've seen
[42:21] an eagle I seen an eagle sitting on the
[42:23] side of the road and he was eating road
[42:25] kill just with all them vultures and
[42:27] everything else and as a young man that
[42:29] bothered me cuz you know I got to look
[42:31] at it up and sometimes Eagles do get on
[42:33] the side of the road and they do eat
[42:34] with all the vultures and they do eat
[42:36] Rogue kill and they do eat things that
[42:38] they shouldn't eat but then I thought
[42:39] you know as I read this scripture well
[42:42] why would God ever call them out if they
[42:43] never were in
[42:45] something it don't mean that the eagle
[42:47] never was there but a mark there was an
[42:48] eagle that was in a system with a Cage
[42:51] Bird there was an eagle that was locked
[42:53] up somewhere with an unclean bird
[42:55] sometimes Eagles they're down there
[42:56] eating BR kill and sometimes they're
[42:58] eating things that they ought not be
[42:59] eating sometimes Eagles are found down
[43:01] in a barnyard but I thank God that the
[43:04] eagle can hear the call of God In This
[43:06] Hour come out of her my people and be
[43:09] not a partaker of her
[43:12] sins there's many that are malnourished
[43:15] but about because they they ain't
[43:16] feeding on the right thing people get
[43:18] too much of things mixed in their diet
[43:20] there's some you know even there's some
[43:21] good Eagles sometimes that their diets
[43:23] messed up they they they get on a all
[43:25] Facebook diet you ever he you ever get
[43:27] get caught up on that one they get on an
[43:28] all Hollywood Diet or a a CNN diet or a
[43:31] Fox News diet but let me tell you
[43:33] friends if that's all you're feeding on
[43:34] you will be
[43:36] miserable why you why will you be
[43:38] miserable because you're an eagle an
[43:40] eagle can sit around and eat Rog kill
[43:42] but after a little while it'll bother
[43:43] his stomach something something ain't
[43:45] right it won't take long and something
[43:46] in that eagle says I can't eat this
[43:48] nonsense any longer I got to go find
[43:50] some fresh meat and you know what he'll
[43:52] do he'll go back in the heavens and
[43:53] he'll search for some fresh kill why
[43:55] because he's an eagle
[43:57] see that's the call of God in this Age
[44:00] come out of her my people you realize
[44:02] that God has called you to a higher
[44:05] Dwelling Place sometimes you get you
[44:07] remember the the story but I'm told
[44:09] about how that that old Eagle sometimes
[44:11] it'll get crusted over and his eyes it
[44:13] go through that molten phase of its life
[44:15] you know and and and it it'll get so
[44:17] moled over that that it can't see no
[44:19] more it can't find food and and it'll
[44:21] it'll be sitting there until it until
[44:23] it's about to it's about to die but the
[44:26] other eagles around what they'll do is
[44:28] but Jared they'll go out and find food
[44:29] and they'll kill food for it and they'll
[44:31] come over there and they'll drop it at
[44:32] his feet I thought my isn't that
[44:34] something what God could teach us
[44:35] through nature that sometimes they get
[44:37] moled over and sometimes they're tore up
[44:39] in their spirit and sometimes they got
[44:41] that old get back or bite back spirit
[44:43] and people they get so worked up but you
[44:44] know what the good Eagles do the good
[44:46] eagles they just go out and they find
[44:48] some fresh mana and they come out and
[44:49] they lay it at their brother's feet they
[44:51] they don't take the opportunity and say
[44:53] well he's down I'll tell you what I'm
[44:54] going to go by and Claw him he'll never
[44:56] know who clawed him I'm going to go by
[44:57] I'm going to beak him a little bit he'll
[44:59] never know who beak him but that ain't
[45:00] what they do they go and they find food
[45:02] and they lay it at his feet so that he
[45:04] can be sustained in that mol stage and
[45:06] they'll nurse him and and give him a
[45:08] little food and they'll eat it up I I
[45:10] thought my if you could see the Eagles
[45:12] today as they would tear apart the meat
[45:14] and lay it at his feet and little B so
[45:16] he could feed on it and draw strength
[45:18] from it until one day he has just enough
[45:21] strength that he could fly again and
[45:22] he'll go back over to the Rock and he'll
[45:24] be he'll use the strength that has been
[45:26] built up by those other eagles and he'll
[45:28] go to beating on that rock until all
[45:30] that M stuff falls off of his face and
[45:32] he can see again replenished
[45:36] encouraged back to his place of being an
[45:38] eagle see sometimes sometimes we got to
[45:42] be we got to hear the call of the eagle
[45:44] the call is to a higher calling we're
[45:46] Eagles we're not we're not canaries
[45:49] we're Eagles we're not parrots we got to
[45:51] hear the call of the eagle come to a
[45:53] greater diet it's the call of the eagle
[45:56] come back to the true word of God it's
[45:58] the call of the eagle get back to the
[46:00] true revelation of the Holy Ghost let me
[46:02] tell you friends Satan Satan wants to
[46:04] keep the word of God away from you he
[46:06] wants to keep it out of out of your
[46:07] heart and out of your life and out of
[46:09] your mouth but let me tell you this word
[46:11] is food for the Eagles it belongs in
[46:13] your mouth Satan will do everything he
[46:16] can to stop it to stop the word from
[46:18] growing in you but let me tell you
[46:19] something there's not one devil that can
[46:21] keep the words from growing in the heart
[46:23] of a Believer some Believers say amen I
[46:26] said there there's not a devil that can
[46:28] keep the word of God out of the heart
[46:30] from growing in the heart of the
[46:31] believer cuz this word is equipped to
[46:33] overcome every
[46:35] devil brother bam said one time he was
[46:37] sitting there praying as he as he would
[46:39] open the scripture he said Lord as we
[46:41] open your word this
[46:42] morning we find a consolation in these
[46:45] Stepping Stones to bring us closer to
[46:46] you he said Lord I pray that the holy
[46:49] spirit will open this word to us that we
[46:52] as thy servants will be better equipped
[46:55] man see it takes a word
[46:57] to be better equipped it takes a word to
[47:00] be fulfilled it takes a word to have
[47:03] strength no wonder the no wonder Satan's
[47:05] doing all that he can to keep the word
[47:07] out of the mouth of the Eagles because
[47:09] he knows it's what gives you strength
[47:11] but brother dve what happens is if you
[47:13] can ever get an eagle to a place where
[47:15] there's some fresh kill they'll get to a
[47:18] place where the word is being opened up
[47:20] to them and the word is being revealed
[47:22] it it may be in in small pieces at first
[47:24] but what it does is it equips us it Ain
[47:27] it ain't just a dead letter this old
[47:28] this old Bible it comes to life and and
[47:31] it's not it's not just some Idle Word or
[47:33] letters on a page it's a revealed word
[47:36] and as it's revealed to the believer
[47:38] then the word begins to drop in their
[47:39] heart and it becomes a revelation and
[47:41] then that Revelation it speaks and when
[47:43] the Revelation speaks mountains start to
[47:45] move brother Tom when it speaks Devils
[47:47] start to flee when it speaks demons they
[47:50] start to tremble when it speaks hell
[47:52] gets out of the way atmospheres change
[47:54] Supernatural things begin to happen
[47:57] said see God has equipped the church
[47:59] with a revealed word of God God at the
[48:02] beginning he gave his children
[48:05] something the very thing that they
[48:07] needed to get through every age but said
[48:09] he gave him an atomic weapon he said why
[48:11] would he give you that cuz he was an
[48:12] eternal God say see he knew there was
[48:14] going to be conflict he knew there's
[48:15] going to be a battle but he equipped his
[48:17] children with the right kind of
[48:18] ammunition the right kind of attack the
[48:20] right kind of everything they had need
[48:22] of that would sweep all the way from
[48:23] Eden all the way to a Rapture glory to
[48:26] God that includes me he gave us what we
[48:29] needed that would work all the way from
[48:30] the Garden of Eden until the time of the
[48:32] Rapture that puts me right in the middle
[48:34] of it that means God gave you a word as
[48:36] an eagle a revealed word that you could
[48:38] feed on that would sustain you in the
[48:40] middle of a famine it's it it's the
[48:43] carcass of the word of God he said what
[48:45] is it it's the word the word that's what
[48:47] defeats Satan it's the word it'll defeat
[48:49] him anywhere any place he said it won't
[48:52] we don't want a substitute of something
[48:53] else why would we take a substitute when
[48:56] we've already got the best thing there
[48:57] is the word of
[48:59] God that fresh word of God Brother David
[49:03] anointed by God is the carcass that the
[49:06] Eagles feed on why don't we need
[49:09] anything else let me tell you friends I
[49:11] don't need drugs to get high I'm an
[49:14] eagle I'm an eagle I don't need the
[49:18] wealth of the world to be happy I'm an
[49:20] eagle it's my satisfying portion the
[49:24] word that we feed on is a satisfying
[49:27] portion of
[49:28] God see listen she saved she saved the
[49:33] prophet and the prophet saved her isn't
[49:36] it something she fed her spirit brother
[49:39] Jared it fed the word it gave life to
[49:41] the word and it sustained her butram
[49:44] said see and then notice what happened
[49:46] when the prophet was saved so was the
[49:47] widow woman butam said see and the God
[49:50] is rich in Mercy he said God saved Moses
[49:53] and the eagle Believers in the time of
[49:55] Moses he said because they had respect
[49:57] to his word and today friend the only
[49:59] way that we can ever have favor with God
[50:01] God is rich in Mercy but we've got to
[50:03] respect what he said about it you just
[50:05] can't take what somebody else said
[50:07] you've got to take what God said he said
[50:09] let every man's word be a lie and let my
[50:11] word be true and today we are told that
[50:14] all you have to do is many places is to
[50:17] join a church or have a Creed or
[50:18] something like that or say a prayer put
[50:20] your name on a book be sprinkled or
[50:22] baptized some certain way or something
[50:24] like that that's all you have to do but
[50:25] that's wrong to be an eagle of God
[50:28] you've got to follow the word day by day
[50:32] hello somebody to be an eagle of God
[50:35] you've got to follow the word day by day
[50:37] he said you've got to continue to feed
[50:39] upon the word of God do you realize
[50:41] friends that this message that we're
[50:42] feeding on is the foundation to every
[50:46] promise of God that lays in this
[50:48] Bible brother Jared it's the foundation
[50:51] to having a happy home it's the
[50:54] foundation of healing it's it's the
[50:56] place to find Salvation it's the place
[50:59] to to see the supernatural it's the it's
[51:02] it's a place to find Refuge it's the
[51:04] place to see Miracles take place but in
[51:07] order for you to see it you have to
[51:10] accept it to be the word of God over
[51:12] your life before you can receive the
[51:14] benefit of it you see most people look
[51:17] at the at this word and brother Dave
[51:19] they want the benefit of it but they
[51:20] wouldn't accept it as to be the word I
[51:23] thought you know it's just something
[51:25] about God's word you know a couple years
[51:27] maybe I guess it was last year me and my
[51:29] wife we were we were thinking about you
[51:32] know everybody was going out and
[51:33] building those those Gardens and some of
[51:34] our family had nice Gardens well we had
[51:36] a little bit of extra space up there by
[51:38] the house and so I thought well you know
[51:40] we can we can make a garden and we we'll
[51:42] just be able to to feed ourselves and
[51:44] that would wouldn't that be nice you get
[51:46] a little bit of reward for your labor
[51:48] and you know so I like I like fried okra
[51:50] so we we got us a plan we're going to
[51:52] have some good okra at home we we'll
[51:54] we'll get the so all that right so we
[51:56] set out our plan to grow some fried
[51:58] ochre but Jared I went down I got I done
[52:01] what I was supposed to do I picked out I
[52:02] went asked the people what's the best
[52:04] kind of ochre that you can buy they told
[52:05] me the best kind and so I got it and we
[52:07] got home and you know and and we we done
[52:10] every everything that that that that we
[52:12] done up to that place and but you know
[52:14] here we are I guess we're about a year
[52:15] and a half later and I don't know if
[52:16] it's Sarah's Green Thumb or or what it
[52:18] is but we never ate one piece of okra
[52:21] off of an ochra plant we had one okra
[52:25] that's ever grown there ain't been the
[52:27] there ain't been a little okra stem move
[52:31] his little okra head above a okra Bloom
[52:34] if they have Bloom brother Joe we have
[52:36] got no
[52:37] fruit from our okra
[52:40] patch not a single fruit but see there's
[52:42] a problem on our farm I don't know if
[52:44] it's just our farm but I I think it
[52:46] might be on other Farms as well but but
[52:48] I can show you the reason why that we
[52:50] never ate okra brother Tim because the
[52:53] okra that we bought is in this package
[52:57] this is what I bought at Home Depot and
[52:59] the problem is is I never took it out of
[53:01] the
[53:03] pack I bought the okra I took it home I
[53:06] put it on a shelf here we are almost two
[53:08] years later I've never ate the fruit of
[53:10] it it's never manifested I've never
[53:12] enjoyed it it's never done one thing for
[53:14] me it's not satisfying for me because
[53:16] it's still in the same package that I
[53:18] bought it in and I think that's what
[53:20] happens to a lot of people is here you
[53:22] see you have to accept the word of God
[53:24] over your life before you can receive
[53:25] the benefit of it you have to take this
[53:27] word and it has to be planted somewhere
[53:29] it can't just be something that's
[53:31] sitting on a shelf it can't just be
[53:32] something that you read but said see see
[53:35] first what happened it had to be planted
[53:37] and then it had to be watered and once
[53:39] it was planted and once it was watered
[53:41] then you'd be able to receive the fruit
[53:43] of the seed that you received and
[53:45] brother said what he said what did
[53:48] Elijah tell the woman that went to do it
[53:51] it was nothing with that nothing but a
[53:53] handful of meal he told her he said you
[53:55] make me a cake first first and then you
[53:57] start he said see the miracle will
[54:00] happen after you take God's word first
[54:03] then you begin to believe God's word and
[54:06] then the miracle will take place on the
[54:08] word see there has to be a foundation
[54:10] you want to see the benefit from the
[54:12] word of God but there has to be a
[54:13] foundation upon God's word and that
[54:15] Foundation is the word has to be placed
[54:18] he said see then the miracle will take
[54:20] place on the word because the word is a
[54:22] seed that brings forth the miracle so
[54:24] you got to take the word first and the
[54:26] Holy Spirit will then come and it'll
[54:28] give it life like water falling from
[54:30] Heaven oh friends let me tell you
[54:32] there's many that's looking for a
[54:33] miracle or a promise from God but you
[54:35] first have to take the seed of the word
[54:37] of God you have to plant it in your life
[54:40] you have to let the water of the Holy
[54:41] Ghost to be water upon it and then the
[54:44] promise will be made
[54:46] manifest see that's the problem today is
[54:49] there's many seeds that just haven't
[54:51] been watered there's many words brother
[54:54] brother Dave there's many words
[54:56] all all kinds of things that are growing
[54:59] there's many there's many there's many
[55:00] other seeds that that have been watered
[55:03] they grow up in all kinds of people's
[55:04] lives many types of religions churches
[55:07] and all kinds of things that grow but
[55:09] you realize that just because it's
[55:11] something that's growing don't mean it's
[55:13] something that's true there's all kinds
[55:15] of seed Jesus said the rain will fall on
[55:17] the just and on the unjust friends let
[55:20] me tell you a secret tonight I'm going
[55:21] to close but every proclaimed Christian
[55:24] is believing some message hello
[55:27] every proclaimed Christian is believing
[55:29] some message that's by somebody but you
[55:33] notice in Matthew the 24th chapter this
[55:35] was the answer to how will we know it's
[55:37] the end
[55:38] time the Jesus said or how we know the
[55:41] sign of the end of the world Jesus said
[55:43] you will know for there shall arise
[55:44] false Christ and false prophets they'll
[55:47] show great signs and wonders in so much
[55:49] if it were possible they would deceive
[55:50] the very elected said notice they were
[55:53] false prophets plural false Christ
[55:55] plural
[55:57] plural see but the anointed one what is
[55:59] an anointed one false Christ a Christ is
[56:01] an anointed one that means it's one with
[56:03] a message so in other words there are
[56:05] teachers in the world that have came
[56:07] through the world today said see but
[56:09] when they come with this message the
[56:11] only way the message can be brought out
[56:13] is one that is Anointed so if a man is
[56:15] going to bring a message he's anointed
[56:16] by something to bring the message so
[56:18] whatever denomination it is whatever
[56:20] Church it is it's a man that's bringing
[56:22] a message and he's anointed by by
[56:24] something to bring a message but the
[56:25] Bible says but there would be there
[56:27] would be a prophet that was anointed but
[56:29] there shall arise false anointed
[56:31] teachers or anointed prophets anointed
[56:33] Christ said what is it it's anointed
[56:35] teachers that are false teaching a
[56:36] message that is false anointed teachers
[56:38] anointed people with a false teaching
[56:40] they're anointed ones in the end time
[56:42] but friends if there're are false Christ
[56:45] and there and then and there are there
[56:47] there are false and there there's a
[56:49] Christ that's true if there's teachers
[56:51] that are false then there's a teaching
[56:53] that's true don't let don't let that
[56:55] scripture discourage you because the
[56:56] Bible said there are false Christ don't
[56:58] look at everybody that's anointed and
[57:00] say well they must be false cuz there's
[57:02] an anointing upon their life but friends
[57:04] because Jesus said the rain falls on the
[57:06] just and the unjust but not only will
[57:08] they have an anointing but you can take
[57:09] them back to the word of God and you'll
[57:11] find out the true anointing will never
[57:13] differ from God's
[57:15] word why because they're Eagles Prophet
[57:18] Eagles followed by Pro by eagle
[57:21] Believers feeding upon an anointed word
[57:24] of God not following after false Christ
[57:27] or false teachers or or false churches
[57:29] or false anointed ones but an anointed
[57:31] word that would be the bread of life
[57:33] that we could feed on that tonight that
[57:35] we're that we're feeding on not not some
[57:37] idea of a man but the word body of the
[57:39] son of man but said I I wasn't the one
[57:42] that appeared down there on the river
[57:44] see many had put this on a man hello
[57:46] many have put this on a man and they've
[57:48] got so far off a left field he said I
[57:50] wasn't the one that appeared down there
[57:51] on the river I was only standing there
[57:54] when he appeared I'm not the one that
[57:56] performs these things and foretells
[57:57] these things that happens as perfect
[57:59] that they are I'm only there whenever he
[58:02] does it I was only a voice that he used
[58:04] to say it it wasn't what I knew it was
[58:07] just I surrendered myself and he spoke
[58:10] through it wasn't me it wasn't the
[58:12] seventh angel oh no it wasn't the
[58:14] Manifest it was the manifestation of the
[58:17] son of man it wasn't the angel his
[58:20] message it was the mystery that God
[58:22] unfolded and it's not a man but it's God
[58:25] that's the history that God unfolded
[58:27] that it wasn't a man it was God it
[58:29] wasn't the messenger it was God through
[58:31] the messenger he said see he said the
[58:34] angel was not the son of man he was the
[58:36] messenger from the son of man the son of
[58:39] man is Christ he's the one that you're
[58:42] feeding on you're not feeding on a man
[58:44] his words will fail but you're feeding
[58:46] on the unfailing body word of the son of
[58:50] man don't you realize friends it's an
[58:52] anointing at the end time it's the ones
[58:55] that the false anointing would be
[58:57] mimicking those false cries would be
[58:59] mimicking but I thank God that there's
[59:01] some true word Believers I thank God
[59:03] that there's some Eagle Believers that
[59:05] would hear thus sayth the Lord out of
[59:07] the mouth of Elijah and that there would
[59:09] be something in her heart there'd be a
[59:11] spirit in her heart that would give life
[59:13] to the word of God and let me tell you
[59:14] friends if you'll ever Surrender Your
[59:16] Life to it you'll never have to worry
[59:18] about feeding you'll never have to worry
[59:20] about being satisfied you'll never have
[59:22] to worry about any famine that would
[59:24] come upon the land today
[59:26] surrender to the word of
[59:29] God surrender to the word of God said
[59:33] it's the when they when you feed it you
[59:36] give it life it'll satisfy you part two
[59:39] I'll bring next week let the music
[59:40] players come said there's many that are
[59:43] falsely anointed but there's only one
[59:45] that's true anointed said who is it it's
[59:48] the son of man the son of man is Christ
[59:51] and he's the one that you're feeding on
[59:54] let's not get confused is it wasn't the
[59:56] messenger The Messengers was just the
[59:58] one that the son of man used he was just
[1:00:01] the voice that the son of man used to
[1:00:03] speak to our heart you realize it wasn't
[1:00:06] Elijah Elijah had no ability to fill
[1:00:08] that woman's meal Barrel he had Elijah
[1:00:11] what what give Elijah the ability to say
[1:00:13] that your meal bear will never run dry
[1:00:16] he was a man just like anybody else but
[1:00:19] the word of the Lord spoke through the
[1:00:21] mouth of
[1:00:22] Elijah and when that woman went back to
[1:00:25] be obedient
[1:00:26] something I just see Elijah I don't know
[1:00:30] that he even thought about it brother
[1:00:32] David as she went to turn to go back and
[1:00:35] something on the inside of him just came
[1:00:36] out and said thus sayeth the Lord your
[1:00:39] meal Barrel will never run
[1:00:42] dry M can you imagine thus sayith the
[1:00:45] Lord your cruise of oil will never
[1:00:50] fail feed the word that feeds
[1:00:54] you is it something
[1:00:58] she gave it she gave it life and it fed
[1:01:01] her he said well how do I give it life
[1:01:03] you allowed to be
[1:01:05] planted you allowed to be watered by the
[1:01:07] Holy Ghost you give it life you let it
[1:01:09] grow and it'll sustain you in the time
