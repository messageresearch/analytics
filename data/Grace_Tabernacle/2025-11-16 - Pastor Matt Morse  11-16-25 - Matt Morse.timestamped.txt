[39:45] clap of praise this morning?
[39:48] Amen. But Ram said, just start thinking

[39:54] close fellowship of the Holy Spirit
[39:56] around you. Amen. How many feels the
[39:59] presence of the Lord this morning? Amen.
[40:01] When I think about the Lord, sometimes
[40:03] it makes me want to clap. And sometimes
[40:05] it makes me want to w to sing. And
[40:09] sometimes it makes me just want to say
[40:10] amen real loud. And sometimes it makes
[40:13] me want to dance in the spirit. When I
[40:15] feel the presence of the Lord, when I

[40:36] the presence of the Lord this morning? I
[40:38] said, how many enjoys the presence of
[40:40] the Lord this morning? Amen. We want to
[40:42] make him welcome. Amen. We've made a lot
[40:45] of effort to be here. Amen. to make a
[40:48] place of worship and put forth a lot of
[40:50] effort and work and uh invitations uh
[40:54] you know uh to be here. Maybe you
[40:56] invited somebody here this morning and
[40:58] you made a sacrifice. You used gas money
[41:00] and travel and gave up sleep and time
[41:04] work and all that just to be in the
[41:06] house of the Lord this morning. So we we
[41:08] don't want to do all of that and then
[41:10] not miss the most important part and
[41:12] that's making him welcome in our
[41:14] presence. Amen. And so we just want God
[41:16] to be welcome. you love the Lord this
[41:18] morning, want to greet our visitors this
[41:20] morning. May God bless you and I just
[41:22] trust something to be said that would
[41:23] [music] be a help uh to the body of
[41:25] believers and Amen. We just we just
[41:28] worship the Lord according to the
[41:29] dictates of our own heart. Amen. And
[41:32] we're going to do something though.
[41:34] Amen. Blink twice if you have to. Amen.
[41:36] At the presence of the Lord. It's just

[41:40] Good to see Jordan and Xavier back
[41:43] [music] with us. And and uh
[41:52] Yeah, little little darling Clarabel.
[41:54] I'm glad she brought her parents to
[41:56] church this morning. I knew she was a
[41:59] good girl all along. Amen. But we're
[42:01] just glad to see them back. Also, just
[42:04] want to remember, I guess, uh, Brother
[42:07] Dave is still still out. Want to
[42:09] remember him in prayer. Also, a prayer
[42:11] request for Rose is at home sick. Uh,
[42:15] and just want to remember her in prayer
[42:16] this morning. Also a prayer request for
[42:20] Paige's grandpa um that is having heart
[42:23] surgery. Just want to remember him and
[42:26] also for brother Marty Mccomomas their
[42:28] family. They called the the family inh
[42:32] today and don't expecting him to live
[42:36] much longer. So we just want to uh call
[42:39] his name before the Lord. And I believe
[42:42] that God is certainly more than able. He
[42:43] knows all things and we trust the Lord.
[42:45] [music] Amen. In all things. So, why
[42:47] don't we just pray uh together this
[42:49] morning? If you have a need on your
[42:50] heart, just lift your hand to the Lord.
[42:51] I know that he's mindful of what we have
[42:54] need [music] of and uh certainly
[42:56] certainly more than able. Let's just
[42:57] pray together. Gracious heavenly father,
[42:59] [music]
[43:00] Lord, how we love you this morning,
[43:02] Lord, and I just say it's a privilege to
[43:05] know you, Lord, and to know that you
[43:07] know me. And Lord, you've never
[43:09] forgotten us. You've never forsaken us,
[43:11] Lord. many times that we've [music]
[43:14] needed you, Lord, and called upon you
[43:16] and you've always done what your word
[43:18] said you would do. Lord, you hear our
[43:20] prayer and you help in a time of need.
[43:22] And God, we trust you, Lord. We trust
[43:24] your leading in our life. Lord, we trust
[43:27] your decisions that you make for us,
[43:29] Lord, knowing that your direction is
[43:31] greater than any direction. Even if it's
[43:34] beyond our understanding, Lord, we still
[43:36] stand here trusting you this morning.
[43:38] Lord, we just ask you, Lord, that you
[43:40] would have your way in this service.
[43:42] Lord, I just pray that you would take
[43:43] every sick person, Lord, that you would
[43:45] heal their body. And Lord, those that
[43:48] just need a touch from you, Lord. May
[43:50] you come by, Lord, and just touch them
[43:52] this morning. Lord, as we take the word
[43:55] of God and we look upon it and read it
[43:59] and speak about it, Lord, may the
[44:01] anointing of the Holy Spirit be present
[44:03] among us, Lord. May you anoint these
[44:05] words, Lord, and make them live among
[44:08] your children that we would go from this
[44:10] place, Lord, being stronger in faith and
[44:12] be strengthened as believers, Lord, to
[44:14] know where we stand. Lord, we just thank
[44:17] you for all that you do. And we give you
[44:19] the glory for all that's done. In Jesus
[44:21] [music] name we pray. Amen. Amen. How
[44:25] many say amen this morning? Amen. We
[44:28] just certainly
[44:30] enjoy those songs. Enjoy those specials
[44:32] this morning. How many enjoyed those?
[44:33] Y'all go ahead and let them know. I I
[44:36] sure appreciate anointed singing. And
[44:38] Amen. Just, you know, that that was I
[44:41] think that was two first. That was
[44:43] Weston's first special and
[44:45] &gt;&gt; [music]
[44:45] &gt;&gt; uh with with mom up there and then I
[44:48] think it was Destiny and Haven's first
[44:50] special together. So I I just love
[44:53] special things and uh [music] and the
[44:55] gifts in these uh ladies lives that God
[44:58] uses them and to create an atmosphere
[45:01] for the word of God to go forth. Amen. I
[45:03] believe that's the purpose of it. And we
[45:05] certainly don't sing to put on a a show
[45:08] or to make a a concert or something. Uh
[45:11] but we but we sing to uh invite the
[45:14] presence of the Lord and to make an
[45:15] atmosphere that God would be welcome.
[45:17] Amen. So, we just want to uh approach
[45:20] the word of God this morning. And and uh
[45:23] we we sure want to invite you to the
[45:25] book of Exodus, the 7th chapter, and
[45:27] we'll read out of the first verse. And
[45:29] Amen. We we enjoy the the preliminaries.
[45:32] Enjoy the worship service. But I want to
[45:34] ask you this this morning. How many
[45:36] enjoys the word of the Lord? Amen. Amen.
[45:38] We certainly uh enjoy it. It's
[45:41] lifegiving. just uh it don't take very
[45:43] much of God's word to to bring life to a
[45:46] believer to change a situation and uh to
[45:48] give answers to questions and uh so I
[45:51] want to read out of Exodus the 7th
[45:52] chapter. We're going to read in the
[45:53] first verse this morning down through
[45:55] the fifth verse and then we'll also uh
[45:57] turn to Revelations the 10th chapter and
[45:59] read from the first verse there. So
[46:01] starting with Exodus in the seventh
[46:03] chapter, the Bible says, "And the Lord
[46:05] said unto Moses, see, I have made thee a
[46:08] god to Pharaoh, and Aaron thy brother
[46:10] shall be thy prophet. Thou shalt speak
[46:12] all that I command thee, and Aaron thy
[46:15] brother shall speak unto Pharaoh, that
[46:17] he send the children of Israel out of
[46:19] this land. And I will harden Pharaoh's
[46:22] heart, and multiply my signs and my
[46:25] wonders in the land of Egypt. But
[46:27] Pharaoh shall not hearken unto you that
[46:30] I may lay my hand upon Egypt. So here
[46:34] that God says he won't listen so that I
[46:37] could lay my hand upon him and and bring
[46:40] forth mine armies and my people, the
[46:41] children of Israel, out of the land of
[46:43] Egypt by great judgments. And the
[46:45] Egyptians shall know that I am the Lord
[46:49] when I stretch forth mine hand upon
[46:51] Egypt and bring out the children of
[46:53] Israel among them. Now, I'd also like to
[46:56] read out of the book of Revelations, and
[46:58] we're going to uh read in the 10th
[47:00] chapter and in the first verse. And the
[47:03] Bible says,
[47:05] "And I saw another mighty angel come
[47:08] down from heaven clothed with a cloud,
[47:09] and a rainbow was upon his head, and his
[47:12] face was as it were the sun, and his
[47:14] feet as pillars of fire. And he had in
[47:16] his hand a little book open, and he set
[47:18] his right foot upon the sea, and his
[47:21] left foot upon the earth. And he cried
[47:23] with a loud voice, as when a lion
[47:25] roarth. And when he had cried, seven
[47:27] thunders uttered their voices. And when
[47:29] the seven thunders had uttered their
[47:31] voices, I was about to write. And I
[47:33] heard a voice from heaven, saying unto
[47:35] me, Seal up those things which the seven
[47:37] thunders uttered, and write them not.
[47:39] And the angel which I saw stand upon the
[47:42] sea, and upon the earth, lifted up his
[47:44] hand to heaven. And he swear by him that
[47:46] liveth forever and ever, who created
[47:48] heaven and the things that are therein,
[47:50] and the earth and the things that are
[47:52] therein, and the sea, and the things
[47:54] that are therein, that there should be
[47:56] time no longer. But in the days of the
[48:00] voice of the seventh angel, when he
[48:02] shall begin to sound, then the mystery
[48:05] of God would be finished, as he hath
[48:07] declared to his servants, the prophets.
[48:10] And we'll just ask the Lord to add add
[48:12] his blessing to the reading of the word
[48:14] this morning as you take your seats. And
[48:16] I would like to take as a subject this
[48:18] morning. When I stretch forth my hand.
[48:22] When I stretch forth my hand. How many
[48:23] loves the uh the opening of the word.
[48:26] Amen. We certainly uh certainly love the
[48:28] the message that God has sent us in this
[48:31] hour. Been such a a revealing. Without
[48:33] it, we wouldn't know where we are or who
[48:36] we were or uh none of those things. But
[48:38] we certainly love the word of God. and
[48:40] it being uh revealed to us. I don't just
[48:42] want something to be revealed to
[48:43] somebody. I want it to be revealed to
[48:44] me. Amen. And how many's like that this
[48:46] morning? Don't don't just give it to
[48:47] somebody else. But Lord, if you have
[48:49] something, go ahead and give it to me.
[48:51] Amen. Don't want to sound greedy, but
[48:52] when it comes to the things of God, I
[48:54] want all of it that God has. Brother
[48:56] Mark was preaching Wednesday on God's
[48:57] benefits. And I thought, I want every
[48:59] one of them. If God has a benefit, I
[49:01] just just put me down for all of it. And
[49:03] you know, last week we were speaking on
[49:05] how uh that it took the supernatural in
[49:07] the first Exodus and and that it would
[49:09] take uh the supernatural was what
[49:11] brought them out and how it would take
[49:13] the supernatural uh in this this Exodus
[49:15] to do the same thing. And uh we had
[49:17] talked about how the prophecies had gone
[49:19] forth concerning the Exodus and how that
[49:22] they were that those prophecies had
[49:24] already been fulfilled. remember even in
[49:26] the days of Jesus and we uh had talked
[49:28] about how that uh how that the
[49:30] prophecies uh concerning Jesus had been
[49:33] fulfilled in Jesus's day. So uh so
[49:36] therefore when the prophecy said a
[49:37] virgin shall conceive, a virgin did
[49:39] conceive and he came forth. He would be
[49:41] born in Bethlehem. It already happened.
[49:43] He would be forsaken. He would he would
[49:45] hang from a tree. And so, uh, we were
[49:47] showing how that these prophecies that
[49:49] were concerning the coming of the Lord
[49:51] are not the prophecies that we're
[49:52] looking to today, uh, for the second
[49:54] coming, but they were for the first
[49:56] coming. And, and every one of them have
[49:58] came to pass. And so, uh, we're not
[50:00] looking back at that. We're not looking
[50:01] for, uh, this to happen again or
[50:04] something to, uh, to be a repeat. But
[50:06] now, we find ourselves in this third
[50:08] Exodus. And in this third Exodus, the
[50:10] same thing. Uh, we have prophecies
[50:12] concerning our day. So, we kind of went
[50:14] through theirs and went through uh Egypt
[50:16] and went through uh uh uh uh uh the day
[50:18] whenever Jesus was upon the earth. But
[50:20] now, uh it comes to our day. And I want
[50:23] to uh begin right in Exodus the 7th
[50:25] chapter because it really opens
[50:27] something up about the age that we're
[50:29] living in. And uh of course, when we
[50:31] read the opening scripture, God is
[50:33] sending Moses and Aaron into the house
[50:35] of Pharaoh. And I love how that God
[50:37] orchestrates this because he tells Moses
[50:40] before he goes into this place, he says,
[50:42] "I'm going to show I I want you to go in
[50:44] and Pharaoh, he's going to ask you to
[50:46] show him a miracle. But when he asked
[50:48] you to show him a miracle, I want you to
[50:50] tell Aaron to put his rod on the ground
[50:52] and that rod shall become a serpent."
[50:54] And so before they ever went into the
[50:56] house of Pharaoh, God began to give them
[50:58] and orchestrate how it was going to play
[51:00] out. And the Bible said that Moses and
[51:02] Aaron, they went in unto Pharaoh and
[51:04] they done as the Lord commanded and and
[51:06] Aaron cast his uh rod upon the ground.
[51:09] It became a serpent. But watch what
[51:11] Pharaoh does that after he is obeying
[51:13] the Lord. And then Pharaoh, the Bible
[51:15] says, he called his wise men and he
[51:17] invited them to the house of Pharaoh and
[51:19] the magicians of Egypt and they and and
[51:21] they did the sorcerers and they did just
[51:23] like the that Aaron done in the manner
[51:26] of their enchantments. They uh they they
[51:28] cast down every man his rod and those
[51:30] rod became serpents and and uh but the
[51:33] Bible says but Aaron's rod swallowed up
[51:35] their rods and he hardened Pharaoh's
[51:37] heart that he hearken not unto them. And
[51:40] you know I thought this was something.
[51:42] Did you notice that uh that whenever
[51:44] Pharaoh's heart became hardened that it
[51:46] never discouraged Moses. It never uh
[51:48] discouraged Aaron. It didn't bring a
[51:50] discouragement because he wouldn't hear
[51:52] the word of the Lord. It didn't bring a
[51:54] discouragement that they brought in
[51:55] their own sorcerers and and and and
[51:57] through their enchantments which was
[51:59] just a a secret art or a secret a secret
[52:02] work that they done. And so uh but it
[52:04] wasn't a discouragement to to Moses
[52:06] because the Bible says he hardened
[52:09] Pharaoh's heart and he hearkened not
[52:11] unto them as the Lord had already said.
[52:15] So So the reason it wasn't a
[52:16] discouragement to Moses is because it's
[52:19] never a discouragement when prophecy is
[52:21] fulfilled. So, it don't matter if it's a
[52:23] negative thing. It don't matter if
[52:24] somebody responds negatively.
[52:27] But, but because it was a prophecy that
[52:29] was fulfilled, it's never a discouraging
[52:31] thing because God had already told them
[52:33] what they would encounter. He said,
[52:34] "You're going to go there. He's going to
[52:36] ask you for a sign. You're going to
[52:37] throw down your staff and the staff will
[52:40] become a serpent and and and his heart
[52:42] heart will be hardened and he's not
[52:44] going to receive you." So, God had
[52:45] already laid it out. And because it was
[52:47] prophecy and because it was fulfilled,
[52:48] [snorts]
[52:49] then they weren't discouraged by by what
[52:51] took place. And and so what Moses done,
[52:54] he just followed what God said. He said,
[52:56] "If it's going to work just the way the
[52:57] God says it, well, tomorrow I'm going to
[52:59] act just like God told me to act. I'm
[53:01] going to do just what God tells me to
[53:03] do." And the Bible said the next
[53:04] morning, then God began to bring
[53:06] judgment upon Israel. Remember, he
[53:08] brought the first plague. And he went
[53:09] down and he stretched his hand out upon
[53:12] the waters of Egypt. And God said,
[53:14] "It'll become blood. The vessels of
[53:16] wood, they'll be filled with blood. The
[53:17] rivers and waters will be filled with
[53:19] blood. The uh the the the the vessels of
[53:21] stone, they will be filled. They'll be
[53:23] filled with blood. Everything in Egypt
[53:25] was filled with blood. What they would
[53:27] drink out of it was filled with blood.
[53:28] There was no water to be found in all of
[53:30] Egypt. And and the Bible says when he
[53:32] smoked the river in the sight of the
[53:34] servants, everything became blood. The
[53:36] fish died. The the the land uh uh began
[53:39] to stink. The river began to stink. They
[53:41] the Egyptians couldn't drink the water.
[53:43] But then after all this took place, well
[53:45] then Pharaoh caused the magicians back
[53:48] into the place and the and the Bible
[53:49] says and the magicians of Egypt did so
[53:52] with their enchantments. And so
[53:54] Pharaoh's heart was hardened. Neither
[53:55] did he hearken under the word of the
[53:57] Lord. So here uh seven days goes by.
[54:00] Moses comes back and he and as the water
[54:02] uh becomes or as he would bring the next
[54:05] plague, the Bible said he laid his
[54:06] stretched his hands out over the waters
[54:08] of Egypt and frogs came up out of the
[54:10] out of the water that cover the land of
[54:13] Egypt. And then Pharaoh called in the
[54:15] magicians and here they come in and the
[54:17] Bible said, "And the magicians did so
[54:20] with their enchantments. They brought
[54:21] frogs upon the land of Egypt." So here
[54:24] we go again. Seven days goes by and now
[54:27] Pharaoh begins to in his heart to
[54:29] realize that this is becoming a great
[54:32] problem in this land. All of a sudden he
[54:34] becomes burdened by the judgment or the
[54:36] plagues that is coming on the land of
[54:38] Egypt. So he makes a deal with Moses. If
[54:40] the frogs will leave and you can get rid
[54:42] of it, then I'll go ahead and I'll let
[54:43] these people go. And so seven days the
[54:46] frogs are cleaned up. The uh there
[54:48] there's piles where they were. It's a
[54:50] it's a mess in the land of Egypt. And of
[54:52] course, Pharaoh being the kind of man
[54:54] that he was, he wasn't able to keep his
[54:56] word. And and so he didn't let the
[54:58] people go. So the Bible said, now here
[55:00] comes the third plague. And now Moses
[55:02] comes back in to the land of Egypt. And
[55:04] he and he smites the dust on the land.
[55:07] He stretched forth the hand upon the
[55:09] dust and it became lice all through the
[55:11] land of Egypt. And and and the Bible
[55:13] said, "But then the magicians came and
[55:15] did so with their enchantments to bring
[55:18] forth lice, but they could not." So
[55:21] there was lice upon every man and upon
[55:23] every beast. So all of a sudden we
[55:25] realize that these magicians there
[55:27] they're they could only go so far. So we
[55:30] went through the first plague and the
[55:31] second plague. You realize there was 10
[55:33] plagues that came upon Egypt. But from
[55:35] but from the time of of the frogs and
[55:37] the time of their their their secret
[55:39] little sorcery or their secret tricks
[55:42] that that they would put to make it
[55:43] mimic what what God was doing that after
[55:46] that second time they weren't able to
[55:48] replicate it. They weren't able to do
[55:49] it. And finally, the magicians came back
[55:52] to Pharaoh and had to admit to Pharaoh
[55:54] that this is only the finger of God that
[55:57] could cause this to happen. We've done
[55:59] all that we can. In other words, uh you
[56:01] know, our folly has been made known. The
[56:03] tricks can only go so far. There's only
[56:05] so many serpents up a sleeve. There's
[56:07] only so many frogs up our sleeve.
[56:09] There's only so many ways that we can
[56:11] make water appear to be blood. And and
[56:13] so but when it came to creating lice and
[56:16] to bringing flies and and to bringing
[56:18] disease upon animals and putting bulls
[56:20] upon a man's skin and and taking bulls
[56:22] off or bringing a great hell storm or
[56:24] locust or darkness or even killing the
[56:26] firstborn, you realize that their
[56:28] ability only went so far. So, but when
[56:31] you read about these magicians and these
[56:33] sorcerers, you'll find out that uh that
[56:35] that they're not even mentioned in the
[56:36] Old Testament. Their names are not
[56:38] mentioned. You'll you'll never find
[56:39] them, but you'll find Paul actually
[56:41] brings their names. He actually
[56:42] introduces uh in Paul in the second
[56:44] chapter of Timothy the third verse uh uh
[56:47] Paul Paul was or in second Timothy the
[56:49] third chapter Paul would speak of the
[56:51] last days and he would talk about the
[56:53] age that we're living in and how that he
[56:55] said the last days perilous times shall
[56:57] come. I'm building a foundation for
[56:58] something but he said in the last days
[57:00] perilous times shall come and men shall
[57:02] be lovers of pleasure more than lovers
[57:04] of God and they be heady and
[57:06] high-minded. And in this scripture that
[57:08] Paul talks about the last days and how
[57:10] that men will be in this last days in
[57:12] the eth verse Paul said and as Janice
[57:14] and Jambber withstood Moses so do these
[57:18] also resist the truth they're men of
[57:20] corrupt minds of repbate concerning the
[57:23] faith. I think this is such a powerful
[57:25] type that Paul used it it it's quite an
[57:27] eyeopener that Paul would use this as a
[57:30] a description of what the people the men
[57:32] would be like in the day that we're
[57:34] living in. So here that Paul the prophet
[57:37] he actually identifies a spirit that's
[57:39] going to be present in the last days
[57:41] would be the same spirit of Janice and
[57:43] Jambers. And so uh you know he uses
[57:45] their names
[57:47] and you won't find them in the Old
[57:48] Testament but you actually can find
[57:50] their names many places in in the if you
[57:52] ever if you ever look in history there
[57:54] there was there was a book called uh the
[57:56] apocryphen of Janice and Jammeris. It
[57:58] was an old Greek book that was found uh
[58:00] that that some portions of it that
[58:01] describes the exploits of these
[58:03] magicians uh even in the Talmud which
[58:05] was the the the legal uh rulings for the
[58:08] Torah or the Hebrew uh Bible. The Talmud
[58:11] is what the the the the Judaism had
[58:13] gathered and and made this is the law
[58:15] and this is what we accept to be truth.
[58:16] Even in the Talmet, they would accept
[58:18] these magicians in the presence of Moses
[58:20] uh to be the same ones that Paul was
[58:23] speaking of named Janice and Jambers.
[58:25] And so, but understanding who they were
[58:27] is not as as important as understanding
[58:30] what they did. There's a reason why Paul
[58:32] would bring this out and he would speak
[58:34] of Janice and Jammeris and and the power
[58:36] that they had these Egyptians had and
[58:39] and how that they tried to replicate the
[58:41] miracles that were performed by Moses
[58:43] and Aaron. And you notice what their
[58:45] purpose was? It was to counter their
[58:47] authority before Pharaoh.
[58:51] Excuse me. So their purpose it was it
[58:55] [clears throat] was to challenge the
[58:56] authority of God's prophet. So here Paul
[58:59] is expressing what is going to be
[59:01] present in this age. He said here they
[59:03] came their purpose it'll be to challenge
[59:04] the authority of God's prophet. But I
[59:06] want you to notice something that this
[59:08] didn't end in Egypt. Because if you'll
[59:09] study or if you ever look at Jewish
[59:11] tradition they actually identify Janice
[59:13] and Jammers as servants of the prophet
[59:15] Balum. uh they would say that Balam uh
[59:18] that that they were they served under
[59:19] him and went out and followed them into
[59:22] the wilderness and and matter of fact
[59:23] they were a part of the men that
[59:25] actually encouraged the uh the the
[59:28] golden calf to be built. And I know
[59:30] that's not well known but uh but but in
[59:32] history they were uh they were known to
[59:34] be encouraers of those that would build
[59:35] a golden calf so that when Moses was up
[59:37] in the wilderness uh that that they
[59:39] would come in they were always
[59:41] undermining what Moses was doing. I
[59:43] don't know if they did that or not.
[59:44] That's just a Jewish tradition. Uh but
[59:46] but here whenever you read that or hear
[59:48] it, you know, it it shows us that if
[59:50] they were followers of Balum and they
[59:52] followed what you have, brother Mark, is
[59:54] you have unbelievers that were serving a
[59:57] makeeliever in the presence of true
[59:59] believers trying to discredit what the
[1:00:01] prophet of God was doing in the age that
[1:00:04] he was called to do it. I I think this
[1:00:05] is a powerful revelation because when
[1:00:07] you understand what that spirit does, it
[1:00:10] makes it easier to identify it today.
[1:00:12] And it don't matter what you read. That
[1:00:14] spirit has been made well known. And
[1:00:15] Paul said, "For these are the sort that
[1:00:18] creep into houses and lead captive silly
[1:00:20] women and laden with sins and led away
[1:00:22] with divers's lust. They're ever
[1:00:24] learning." Talking about these silly
[1:00:25] women, ever learning, never able to come
[1:00:28] to the knowledge of the truth. These are
[1:00:29] the sorts that come into these houses.
[1:00:31] And these are the sorts, these men like
[1:00:33] Janice and Jambers. He says, "See there
[1:00:35] we we realize that today that many good
[1:00:38] people have been affected by the same
[1:00:40] spirit of Janice and Jambers. They they
[1:00:42] have been led astray. They're going in
[1:00:44] the camp of Israel and they're and
[1:00:45] they're because they're unbelievers and
[1:00:47] and they're le leading people away by
[1:00:50] divers lust. They're leading people away
[1:00:52] and leading them and captivating them by
[1:00:54] sin. Women that are laden with sin and
[1:00:57] they they'd rather serve the world than
[1:00:58] serve God. All it took was a little
[1:01:01] voice or a little spirit of Janice and
[1:01:03] Jammers to come in the house and to
[1:01:05] discredit the prophet of God and and
[1:01:07] what God was doing in the age that they
[1:01:09] live in. And that's what Paul is is
[1:01:11] testifying or prophesying as what would
[1:01:13] happen in this age. Friends, this is a
[1:01:15] powerful revelation to catch because it
[1:01:17] opens your eyes that that's what's
[1:01:19] taking place in this age. There's a
[1:01:20] spirit in the land today that would
[1:01:22] cause the people of God to turn away
[1:01:25] from the move of God or the prophet of
[1:01:27] God and to say that there's something
[1:01:28] else or you know that discredited. Even
[1:01:31] other men was able to do that and other
[1:01:33] people preached that doctrine and you
[1:01:35] know other people before them had a word
[1:01:37] like that. And so so you recognize the
[1:01:40] spirit, but I want to show this that
[1:01:41] before Paul ever says it and before he
[1:01:43] ever warns of them, Jesus when he was
[1:01:45] speaking of the end time, remember we're
[1:01:47] talking about the prophecies concerning
[1:01:49] our age today. And and when Jesus would
[1:01:51] speak in Matthew the 24th chapter, he
[1:01:53] said as he sat up on the Mount of
[1:01:55] Olives, remember he was speaking of the
[1:01:56] end time to the disciples and and they
[1:01:58] said, "What when shall these things be?
[1:02:00] And what is the sign of thy coming? And
[1:02:02] what is going to be the end of the
[1:02:03] world?" And when Jesus speaks of what
[1:02:05] the end of the world would be like, he
[1:02:07] he would talk, you notice what he would
[1:02:09] we would talk about how that things
[1:02:10] would take place and what and if you
[1:02:12] ever you ever studied the scripture, I'm
[1:02:14] not going to go through it all this
[1:02:15] morning, but but if you ever study the
[1:02:17] scripture in Matthew 24, Jesus is
[1:02:19] answering what the end of the world
[1:02:21] would look like. This is a very
[1:02:22] question. How will I know that we're
[1:02:24] living in the end time? And as he would
[1:02:26] lay this out in Matthew the 24th
[1:02:28] chapter, you'll find that that he
[1:02:30] actually is actually speaking the very
[1:02:32] same things that would take place in the
[1:02:34] opening of the seals in Revelations the
[1:02:36] 6th chapter. I know I know many of you
[1:02:39] have studied it or or or listen to the
[1:02:40] series of the seals and and or the
[1:02:43] opening of the seals or the seven seals.
[1:02:44] So but but we realize that what was
[1:02:46] taking place just for the sake of of
[1:02:48] some new people. Let let me just can I
[1:02:50] just lay this out here? We come here to
[1:02:52] have church anyway. and and but
[1:02:54] Revelations the 5th chapter John sees
[1:02:55] this in a vision. He said, "I saw in the
[1:02:57] right hand of him that set up on the
[1:02:59] throne a book that was written and on
[1:03:01] the backside it was sealed with seven
[1:03:03] seals." So here here in John's vision,
[1:03:05] he saw the throne of God in his hand was
[1:03:08] a book. It was sealed with seven seals.
[1:03:10] In other words, it was not open. It was
[1:03:12] a mystery. It would remain a mystery.
[1:03:14] Even when John saw it, he said, "Seal it
[1:03:16] up until the last days when the seventh
[1:03:18] angel would sound. The mystery of God
[1:03:20] would be made plain." So we see in the
[1:03:22] opening of the seals in Revelation the
[1:03:24] sixth chapter, brother Bramwood preached
[1:03:26] through this, but in the opening of the
[1:03:27] seals, notice how how he speaks this. He
[1:03:30] says uh in Revelation 6, and when the
[1:03:32] lamb opened one of the seals, the first
[1:03:35] seal, he said, I saw behold a white
[1:03:37] horse, and he that sat upon him had a
[1:03:39] bow, and a crown was given unto him, and
[1:03:41] he went forth conquering and to conquer.
[1:03:44] Now, I don't know about you, you know,
[1:03:45] you if you if you read your Bible, maybe
[1:03:47] if you open it up whenever you get home,
[1:03:49] open up to Revelation 6. I have a a
[1:03:51] chain reference Bible. So it has the
[1:03:53] commentator on the side and and uh in
[1:03:56] the very chain reference of my Bible, it
[1:03:58] actually takes this scripture of
[1:04:00] Revelation 6 and2 and and in the chain
[1:04:03] reference, it references it to
[1:04:05] Revelations 19:11. How many knows what
[1:04:07] 1911 is? Revelations 19:11 is whenever
[1:04:11] Christ would come on a white horse. The
[1:04:13] Bible said he came on a white horse. It
[1:04:15] was him that was called faithful and
[1:04:17] true. So even in my own Bible when I
[1:04:20] read it without a revelation the I'm not
[1:04:22] saying the Bible's wrong but the
[1:04:23] commentator was wrong whenever he put it
[1:04:25] in there it made them the same because
[1:04:27] he said there this was Christ just like
[1:04:29] it was in Revelations 19:11 it was the
[1:04:31] same Christ but you notice what happened
[1:04:34] is as Jesus as as the seal was being
[1:04:37] open can you take some of that high down
[1:04:39] off of this brother. Thank you. as the
[1:04:40] seal was being opened, the um uh the
[1:04:43] that that the prophet of God would
[1:04:45] actually take this scripture and bring a
[1:04:47] revelation or a mystery that's been
[1:04:49] laying there the whole time and show
[1:04:51] that it wasn't Christ at all. And he and
[1:04:53] it wasn't what was present in the
[1:04:55] scripture that made him know it, but it
[1:04:57] was what wasn't present. Remember, he
[1:04:58] said because he had a bow, but you'll
[1:05:00] notice that he never had any arrows. So
[1:05:03] therefore, he was a bluff and and so so
[1:05:05] he so this was a this was one that was
[1:05:08] pretending to be a Christ. Now, if
[1:05:10] you'll go back to Matthew the 24th
[1:05:11] chapter, whenever Jesus is speaking, uh
[1:05:14] he says that in the first verse, he
[1:05:16] says, "Take heed that no man deceive
[1:05:18] you." Remember, what will it be like in
[1:05:20] the end? Jesus says, "Many shall come in
[1:05:22] my name, saying, I am Christ and shall
[1:05:25] deceive many." So, that's why the
[1:05:27] prophet of God would show us that
[1:05:28] Matthew 24 is actually prophesying of
[1:05:32] the seals being opened. M and I'm not
[1:05:34] going to go through it this morning, but
[1:05:35] all through Revelation 6, even the very
[1:05:37] next verse, Jesus said, "Nation shall
[1:05:38] rise against nation, kingdom against
[1:05:40] kingdom. There'll be famines and
[1:05:42] pestilence in the land." And and when
[1:05:44] you read Revelation 6, you'll see right
[1:05:46] there and the second seal was open. It
[1:05:47] said there was a power given unto him to
[1:05:49] take peace off of the earth that they
[1:05:51] would kill one another. It was given him
[1:05:53] a great sword. So Jesus shows us that
[1:05:56] what's coming in the end time or what's
[1:05:58] a sign of the end time or sign uh uh uh
[1:06:01] that the rapture is at hand a sign that
[1:06:03] we're living in that last age. He's
[1:06:05] showing us is whenever these seals are
[1:06:08] open is a sign of that very thing. So
[1:06:10] now watch what Jesus does. As a part of
[1:06:12] that answer, he says during this time in
[1:06:14] Matthew 24, he said, "There shall arise
[1:06:17] false Christ and false prophets and
[1:06:19] shall show great signs and wonders in so
[1:06:22] much that if it were possible, it would
[1:06:24] deceive the very elect." So here, here
[1:06:28] Jesus lays this out that there is coming
[1:06:30] false Christ. There's coming false
[1:06:32] prophets that'll show great signs and
[1:06:34] wonders, and if it was possible, they
[1:06:35] would deceive the very elect of God. So
[1:06:38] notice first Jesus speaks this. There's
[1:06:40] coming false Christs. There's coming
[1:06:42] false prophets. Then Paul comes right in
[1:06:44] behind them. And he said, "In that day,
[1:06:46] there's religious people. They'll have a
[1:06:48] form of godliness. They'll lead silly
[1:06:49] women away with all kinds of worldly
[1:06:51] lust." And and friends, let me tell you
[1:06:53] this. As much as they stood there in the
[1:06:55] day and resisted Moses today, that
[1:06:58] spirit is still here to resist and to
[1:07:00] withstand. You say, "Well, who are they
[1:07:02] resisting?" Let me tell you, it's
[1:07:03] wherever the truth of God is coming
[1:07:05] from. So if God is going to bring a
[1:07:07] truth in this age, then you better
[1:07:09] believe there's a spirit of Janice and
[1:07:11] Jambers that is present in this age to
[1:07:13] lead people away from the truth of God
[1:07:15] to to discredit the power of God, to
[1:07:17] discredit the supernatural. And and when
[1:07:19] God's trying to bring a revelation to
[1:07:21] the church, there's going to be a spirit
[1:07:23] just like Janice and Jambers that is
[1:07:25] going to be there to resist. Let me tell
[1:07:27] you friends what we ought to do this
[1:07:28] morning. You ought to look the devil in
[1:07:30] the eye that pushes against the truth of
[1:07:32] God and pushes against the word of God
[1:07:34] and say, "Devil, you found a truehearted
[1:07:36] believer." So when the devil comes
[1:07:38] pushing, then we ought to turn back to
[1:07:40] him and say, "But you found one here
[1:07:42] that you can't bluff, that you can't
[1:07:44] deceive, that you can't push because I'm
[1:07:46] a believer. I'm a son of God. I'm a
[1:07:48] daughter of God. And I just so happen to
[1:07:50] push back." I think it's time this
[1:07:52] morning that when the devil pushes that
[1:07:54] we go ahead and throw our shoulders back
[1:07:56] and take the word that God has given us
[1:07:58] and push back on the devil and say, "But
[1:08:00] I've been called in this hour and I
[1:08:02] realize there's false Christ and there's
[1:08:04] false prophets and there's false
[1:08:06] teachers that have been raised in this
[1:08:08] age with the spirit of Janice and
[1:08:10] Jammers to lead people astray. It don't
[1:08:13] discourage the believer when you see
[1:08:15] these things happening because it's
[1:08:16] already been prophesied that would
[1:08:18] happen in this. There's many prophecies
[1:08:20] that are concerning the age that we live
[1:08:22] in. Paul said in the last days, these
[1:08:25] times will come. Jesus said this will be
[1:08:27] a sign of the end times. See, there's a
[1:08:29] reason that the same type of spirit of
[1:08:31] Janice and Jambers would return. It's
[1:08:34] because it's at the end time. It's in
[1:08:36] when they appeared before they appeared
[1:08:38] in an Exodus age. It was at the time of
[1:08:40] Exodus. It was a time of departure and
[1:08:43] going into this new land that they would
[1:08:46] come present. And friends, but now here
[1:08:48] we are in the end time. and we find
[1:08:49] oursel in another Exodus age. It's no
[1:08:51] wonder Paul would pick them up and say
[1:08:53] in the last days that same spirit will
[1:08:56] be there resisting the truth of God's
[1:08:59] word. But see, that ain't the only thing
[1:09:00] that would be there in the end time.
[1:09:02] Remember what Jesus said, Luke 17,
[1:09:04] prophecies concerning our age. He said,
[1:09:06] "The days will come when you shall
[1:09:09] desire to see one of the days of the Son
[1:09:11] of Man, and you shall not see it. But
[1:09:13] they shall say to you, see here, see
[1:09:15] there, but don't go after them, and
[1:09:17] don't follow them.
[1:09:19] Now, isn't that a good word?
[1:09:21] &gt;&gt; I've heard that very thing. See here,
[1:09:24] see there, see here. Don't Don't Why you
[1:09:27] believe what you believe? See here, see
[1:09:29] right there. See here. Why do you
[1:09:30] believe what you believe? But Jesus
[1:09:31] said, don't follow after them. He said,
[1:09:34] see, because I must suffer many things,
[1:09:36] the son of man would be rejected in this
[1:09:37] generation. He said, but as it was in
[1:09:40] the days of Noah, so shall it also be in
[1:09:42] the days of the son of man.
[1:09:45] &gt;&gt; See, in this age, they will reject
[1:09:47] truth. I know it's quiet here this
[1:09:48] morning, but the devil wants he he don't
[1:09:50] like it whenever you come getting on his
[1:09:52] toes. But this is the age that they will
[1:09:54] reject truth. This is the age where the
[1:09:56] spirit would come in to to not be a open
[1:09:59] heart and to be able to receive the
[1:10:00] truth of the word. But Jesus said, "But
[1:10:02] even thus shall be in the day when the
[1:10:04] son of man is revealed." And brother
[1:10:06] Bram actually takes this scripture and
[1:10:08] he ties it to Apostle Paul and in in
[1:10:11] second Timothy he said as Janice and
[1:10:13] Jammers withtood Moses the anointed word
[1:10:15] of the hour so will these men not man
[1:10:18] but so will these men these anointed
[1:10:21] ones they will come and resist truth you
[1:10:23] say what day will they resist truth but
[1:10:25] Ram said they will resist it in the very
[1:10:27] day when the son of man is revealed so
[1:10:30] they hadn't all through these ages
[1:10:32] resisted this this was reserved for a
[1:10:35] time Their appearing was reserved for a
[1:10:37] time of exodus. The day when the son of
[1:10:39] man would be revealed. You say, "Well,
[1:10:40] when is that going to be?" Well,
[1:10:41] Revelations 10:7 tells us, in the days
[1:10:44] of the voice of the seventh angel, that
[1:10:45] was the messenger that God would send in
[1:10:47] this age, when he shall begin to sound.
[1:10:49] The mystery of God should be finished as
[1:10:51] he hath declared unto his servants of
[1:10:53] prophets. But said, see, the seventh
[1:10:55] angel's message, which was the opening
[1:10:58] of the seals, that was the seventh
[1:11:00] angel's message. I know a lot of people
[1:11:01] get this mixed up because when they read
[1:11:03] Luke 17:30 and they read Revelations
[1:11:06] 10:7 and they realize that the that the
[1:11:08] messenger is going to come and and the
[1:11:11] son of man is going to be revealed that
[1:11:13] many have made the messenger the son of
[1:11:15] man. But let me just make this plain
[1:11:17] this morning. The messenger was not the
[1:11:19] son of man. The the prophet of God was
[1:11:21] not the son of man. He he in no way the
[1:11:24] angel matter of fact the Bible would
[1:11:25] tell you the angel is not the son of
[1:11:27] man. The messenger was just there to
[1:11:29] reveal the son of man. But said, "People
[1:11:31] can't get it separated." He said, "But
[1:11:33] but that's what seems to be so hard." He
[1:11:36] said, "But he was not the son of man
[1:11:37] himself, the messenger. He wasn't the
[1:11:39] son of man, the the seventh angel. He
[1:11:42] was a messenger, but he was revealing
[1:11:44] the son of man to the public. So here
[1:11:48] his purpose was to come and bring what
[1:11:50] was private and reveal it in the public,
[1:11:53] the presence of the son of man. No
[1:11:54] wonder this was no wonder that this
[1:11:57] would bring about the spirit of Janice
[1:11:59] and Jambers. What did Moses do when he
[1:12:01] went down into Egypt? He didn't go into
[1:12:03] the private chambers of Pharaoh, but he
[1:12:05] went into Pharaoh's court and he said,
[1:12:07] "I demand that you let God's children
[1:12:09] go." It's a time of Exodus. They're
[1:12:10] going into a land. God has called them
[1:12:12] into this place of worship. And Pharaoh
[1:12:14] called I don't think it was a quiet
[1:12:16] thing. I don't think it was a little
[1:12:18] secret thing, but the Bible says Pharaoh
[1:12:19] called his great sorcerers and his
[1:12:21] magicians through the land of Egypt.
[1:12:23] Then he brought them into his core. It
[1:12:24] was a very very public act that God was
[1:12:27] performing in the land of Egypt. And
[1:12:29] they would come and try to withstand
[1:12:31] what God is doing. Even even down even
[1:12:33] down when Moses was up on Mount Si, it
[1:12:36] was a public thing to bring a golden
[1:12:38] calf down before the children of Israel
[1:12:40] to discredit what God was doing through
[1:12:42] the hand of Moses. So we [snorts]
[1:12:44] realize he said he was revealing the
[1:12:46] public to the son of man to the public.
[1:12:49] And in the day that Janice and Jambers
[1:12:52] will withstand the anointed ones, them
[1:12:54] make believers, unbelievers, those
[1:12:56] church formal, the Pentecostals that
[1:12:58] stand up against it because he said,
[1:13:00] "But let them alone because their folly
[1:13:02] will be made manifest soon. So go ahead
[1:13:04] and let them alone." Let me let me just
[1:13:06] let me just lay this out here this
[1:13:08] morning. Do you realize that this
[1:13:09] Pentecostal denomination had been formed
[1:13:12] in the age that we lived in? It didn't
[1:13:14] exist back in in in in the 1800s. This
[1:13:17] is is something that has take place in
[1:13:19] our age. The the the very age the
[1:13:20] Leodysian age uh that when the angel
[1:13:23] would come and sound this church this
[1:13:25] church age has become a denomination
[1:13:27] just like every other church age became
[1:13:29] a denomination. Uh in Roman Catholicism
[1:13:31] what happened when Martin Luther came to
[1:13:33] preach? Martin Luther came to rebuke the
[1:13:36] Catholic and then the ca then what what
[1:13:38] did they do? They turned into an
[1:13:39] organization and then John Wesley came
[1:13:41] and he rebuked the Lutheran and then
[1:13:43] they turned into an organization. And
[1:13:45] notice when the outpouring of the Holy
[1:13:47] Ghost came on Isuza Street and then and
[1:13:49] then all of a sudden it turned into a
[1:13:51] denomination. What did the prophet of
[1:13:52] God do in this age? But he turned and he
[1:13:54] rebuked Pentecostalism just like Martin
[1:13:57] Luther rebuked the Catholic and just
[1:13:59] like John. This isn't a new thing. It's
[1:14:01] God's servant that he would send in his
[1:14:03] age to call the people of God back to
[1:14:05] the word of God to to keep the folly of
[1:14:08] men. It's to call us away from an
[1:14:10] organization and back to the true word
[1:14:12] of God. It's a rebuke of Pentecostalism
[1:14:14] and denominationalism
[1:14:16] and being led by men. Don't you realize
[1:14:18] it's such a twist that Satan has put
[1:14:20] upon the message of the hour to call,
[1:14:22] you know, to call you men followers and
[1:14:24] the reality. It's the word of God. Isn't
[1:14:27] that what they were called in the days
[1:14:28] of Moses? You mean you'd go out there in
[1:14:30] a wilderness and follow after a man
[1:14:32] that's packing a stick? You're such a
[1:14:34] man follower, follow after Moses and
[1:14:36] Aaron. But friends, isn't it such a
[1:14:38] twist that God would come in this age to
[1:14:40] keep people from following after men and
[1:14:42] then the devil would come right behind
[1:14:44] him, that little spirit of Janice and
[1:14:46] Jammers, and sneak into home and saying
[1:14:48] they're just men followers and and
[1:14:50] they're following after a man. But the
[1:14:51] reality is they're following after the
[1:14:54] pillar of fire that came in the
[1:14:56] wilderness, the pillar of fire that was
[1:14:57] present in Pharaoh's court, the pillar
[1:14:59] of fire that led them down to the to the
[1:15:02] bank of the Red Sea. And that same
[1:15:04] pillar of fire has been present in this
[1:15:06] age.
[1:15:07] &gt;&gt; So the pillar of fire is purpose was to
[1:15:09] come and to call us away from following
[1:15:11] after men and men's religion and men's
[1:15:13] denomination that you you can't you know
[1:15:16] I I know what they say. I'm just I'm
[1:15:18] just giving you some good teaching this
[1:15:19] morning. But I know what they say. Well,
[1:15:20] you can't find this name in the Bible.
[1:15:22] You can't find not one denomination name
[1:15:24] in the Bible except for millions of
[1:15:26] people today still follow after men and
[1:15:28] religions that men have built. But God
[1:15:30] has called the people of God away from
[1:15:33] that and back to the true word of God.
[1:15:35] He says, but notice he said here, come
[1:15:37] out of this organization. But the very
[1:15:40] day when this messenger, not when he
[1:15:42] starts his message, but the very day
[1:15:44] when he begins to declare his message,
[1:15:47] not when he first came on the scene, but
[1:15:48] when he be, let me resay that, but when
[1:15:50] he begin to declare his message. See,
[1:15:53] the first pull was healing. The second
[1:15:54] pull was prophesying. The third pull was
[1:15:57] the opening of the word or the mysteries
[1:15:59] of God being revealed. In other words,
[1:16:01] when the third when when the third pull
[1:16:02] of of this messenger's message came,
[1:16:05] here would come the opening of the word.
[1:16:07] Here the seals would be open. The
[1:16:09] mystery uh would no longer be a mystery.
[1:16:11] The things of God that have been hidden
[1:16:13] all along would be brought out in this
[1:16:14] age. But notice as it would come, that
[1:16:17] is when this spirit becomes present.
[1:16:20] &gt;&gt; It wasn't there for healing. It wasn't
[1:16:22] trying to disprove uh disprove in that
[1:16:25] way. But he said here, notice when he
[1:16:27] would come, right, when the mysteries
[1:16:28] would be revealed in the opening of the
[1:16:30] word. But let me tell you, it was just
[1:16:32] like it was in the days of Moses. How's
[1:16:34] a mystery ever revealed? There's never
[1:16:36] been a mystery of God that was revealed
[1:16:38] that wasn't done from a mouth of a
[1:16:39] prophet.
[1:16:41] &gt;&gt; But he was revealed in the in this in
[1:16:43] this day in it was a prophet. The third
[1:16:45] brother said, "Remember this. There's no
[1:16:47] higher order than a word from the pro
[1:16:49] than the prophet." And remember the
[1:16:50] third pull was the opening of them seven
[1:16:53] seals to reveal the hidden truth that
[1:16:56] had been sealed in the word. And it is
[1:16:59] then in that day when this thing is to
[1:17:01] take place that Janice and Jambers the
[1:17:03] impersonators will appear again just
[1:17:06] like they did when Moses appeared with
[1:17:07] the original word to say it. They appear
[1:17:10] to impersonate it. That's exactly right.
[1:17:12] The very thing you see in Matthew 24:24,
[1:17:15] they're anointed ones. They're anointed
[1:17:17] in this age to do that very thing.
[1:17:19] Friends, you don't have to go very far
[1:17:20] in history to look back and see that
[1:17:22] that ain't exactly the truth. When p
[1:17:24] when the when the when the spirit of God
[1:17:26] fell on Isuzua Street, there was a great
[1:17:28] Pentecostal revival. It didn't take very
[1:17:30] long. There was the great healing
[1:17:32] campaigns, a great move of God, a move
[1:17:34] of the Holy Ghost across this nation.
[1:17:36] But it didn't take long when the word
[1:17:38] begins to be revealed. And here, God
[1:17:40] would bring a prophet up among all of
[1:17:42] these people. and he would begin to
[1:17:44] reveal the word of God and open up the
[1:17:46] the seals that had been hidden, the
[1:17:48] mystery that had been hidden. You'll
[1:17:49] notice that as the spirit of God would
[1:17:52] leave out of that what was called that
[1:17:54] great move of God, that great Holy Ghost
[1:17:56] move. I don't know if you ever been to
[1:17:57] one of them churches, but it makes you
[1:17:59] sick at your stomach to go to some
[1:18:01] Pentecostal denomination today. And what
[1:18:03] I I I'm not talking about your friends,
[1:18:05] but of course because we're not talking
[1:18:06] about the people, but but the spirit
[1:18:08] that that that they're under, but to sit
[1:18:10] and beat somebody on the chin and try to
[1:18:12] create a speaking in tongues and to
[1:18:14] shake somebody and try to make them
[1:18:16] speak in tongues and and what are they
[1:18:18] doing is trying to impersonate the Holy
[1:18:20] Ghost. It's the very spirit that Paul
[1:18:22] spoke of in this age of people that
[1:18:25] would come and they'll rank up a crank
[1:18:27] up a bunch of music and go out screaming
[1:18:29] out and t holling to the top of their
[1:18:31] lungs and you know you know they're
[1:18:33] there people practicing divine healing.
[1:18:35] They're they're hollering to the top of
[1:18:36] their lungs and demanding God to do
[1:18:38] things and and it don't move God at all.
[1:18:40] Brother said I went to a meeting one
[1:18:42] time they had old fell in a sheet. They
[1:18:44] were shaking him back and forth and then
[1:18:45] the then the guy come up had rheumatism
[1:18:47] and they just slapped him as hard as
[1:18:49] they could and said, "I hate
[1:18:50] rheumatism." He said, "But that don't
[1:18:52] never take devils out. You can shake
[1:18:54] them how hard you want to. You can push
[1:18:56] them down. You can pick them up. You can
[1:18:58] bite them on the chin. You can push them
[1:19:00] down by their head. All of the folly
[1:19:02] that men does across the world and call
[1:19:05] it the Holy Ghost. But I can tell you
[1:19:06] what a prophet said. He said, "The devil
[1:19:08] don't care how much you holler cuz the
[1:19:10] devil ain't hard to hear anyway." He
[1:19:12] said, "But the only thing that'll move
[1:19:13] the devil is faith because he knows
[1:19:15] where faith lays. And if you'll ever
[1:19:17] find a real true believer or a real true
[1:19:20] son or daughter of God that has the
[1:19:21] faith of God in their heart, that's the
[1:19:23] only thing that'll make the devil move.
[1:19:26] They're carnal impersonators in this
[1:19:28] world. Impersonating the move of God and
[1:19:30] impersonate the Holy Ghost. And then
[1:19:32] when people see the real thing, they
[1:19:34] can't even hardly believe it because the
[1:19:36] impersonation has taken over the world.
[1:19:39] It has taken over the world to create
[1:19:41] atmospheres and create worship centers
[1:19:44] and atmospheres that looks like God. But
[1:19:46] don't you realize that that that many
[1:19:47] today, Can you imagine if somebody came
[1:19:49] in the church this morning that had
[1:19:51] nails scars in his hands and and and and
[1:19:52] and sandals on his feet and had a had a
[1:19:56] long beard and says, "I am the Lord."
[1:19:58] Well, you wouldn't believe it because
[1:20:00] any hypocrite, any actor could do that
[1:20:02] very thing. But brother Bam said, "But
[1:20:04] what we're looking for is the life that
[1:20:06] he had." He said because his body
[1:20:08] sitting on the right hand of the majesty
[1:20:10] and when he comes there will be no time
[1:20:12] any longer when his body returns to the
[1:20:14] earth. He said but don't worry his
[1:20:16] spirit is still here and his life is
[1:20:18] giving evidence of him being here
[1:20:20] because he said in his word I'll be with
[1:20:22] you even in you even unto the end of the
[1:20:25] world.
[1:20:27] &gt;&gt; So we see in this age that we're living
[1:20:28] in that three things have been
[1:20:30] fulfilled. There's three things that
[1:20:32] lays right before the believer today.
[1:20:33] First thing is the world is in a solemn
[1:20:36] condition. How many recognizes that?
[1:20:38] &gt;&gt; I don't have to go through it. The world
[1:20:40] is in a solemn condition. It's
[1:20:41] perversion on every hand. It's open.
[1:20:43] It's public perversion. Matter of fact,
[1:20:45] you're ridiculed if you won't accept
[1:20:47] public perversion. That's how that's how
[1:20:49] much of a solemn condition that this
[1:20:51] world is in. Second thing in the in this
[1:20:53] hour is that the scripture that Janice
[1:20:56] and Jambus appears has been fulfilled.
[1:20:59] Here they are. That somebody say amen.
[1:21:01] &gt;&gt; I'm not the only person that hears that.
[1:21:03] I I'm not the only person that has heard
[1:21:05] that spirit come around say don't
[1:21:06] believe this and don't don't follow
[1:21:08] after it and you know other people had
[1:21:10] that same I'm not the only person that
[1:21:11] heard that I I know every one of you in
[1:21:13] the building's heard the same thing and
[1:21:14] so we recognize that the spirit of
[1:21:16] Janice and Jambers are or the same
[1:21:18] spirit that they had here it's operating
[1:21:20] today the third thing he said in the
[1:21:22] same it's the same hour that the son of
[1:21:25] man is to be revealed this is what
[1:21:26] brother Bam said recognize there's three
[1:21:28] things that are laying before you right
[1:21:30] now the world is in a sodom condition
[1:21:32] Jan Dennis and Jambers has appeared and
[1:21:34] it's the same hour that the son of man
[1:21:36] is to be revealed. Says, see, so there's
[1:21:39] your believer, your makebeliever, and
[1:21:41] your unbeliever. All three. There's a
[1:21:43] genuine word that's standing out there
[1:21:45] that's been vindicated. There's a makeel
[1:21:46] believer that's impersonating it. And
[1:21:48] there's an unbeliever there that's
[1:21:50] rejecting the whole thing. But I thank
[1:21:52] God this morning, brother Mark, that
[1:21:53] we've bypassed it. I thank God that
[1:21:55] there's a people that that that ain't
[1:21:57] just unbelievers and they ain't just
[1:21:58] make believers and we're not just
[1:22:00] impersonating something, but I thank God
[1:22:02] that there's some real truehearted
[1:22:03] believers that have got a hold of the
[1:22:05] word of God that they have saw by
[1:22:07] revelation and we bypass the creeds and
[1:22:10] and the things that men would take us
[1:22:11] into. Brother said what we need today,
[1:22:14] he said we need an opening of the word
[1:22:16] that lives. It ain't just something that
[1:22:18] God has spoken for a day gone by. It
[1:22:20] ain't just something that you can read
[1:22:22] about and be something of history. But I
[1:22:24] believe the opening of the word is
[1:22:26] something that has to be revealed to
[1:22:28] every heart that you can see the age
[1:22:29] that you live in that God has came down
[1:22:32] in this very age and he's made the son
[1:22:34] of man present. Why did he's do so many
[1:22:36] supernatural signs? It was to make the
[1:22:39] son of man known publicly among the
[1:22:41] people. I thank God. I wonder how many
[1:22:43] could lift your hand this morning and
[1:22:44] say, "I see it. God bless all seven of
[1:22:46] y'all. I see it. 9 10 11 12. We're
[1:22:48] getting more." I thank God that there's
[1:22:50] some people that have seen that public
[1:22:52] expression of the son of man being made
[1:22:54] known in this hour. He said, "See, what
[1:22:56] we need today is an opening of the word
[1:22:58] that lives." Now, you see, so what it
[1:23:01] does, the the opening of the word, it
[1:23:02] shouldn't put you down. It shouldn't
[1:23:04] make you defeated. It shouldn't make you
[1:23:06] come to church and just sit on your
[1:23:07] hands. The open a revelation is
[1:23:09] something that brings revival. And
[1:23:11] whenever you really see it, brother Mah,
[1:23:12] it changes who you are. The whole world,
[1:23:14] they can have anointed preachers and
[1:23:16] people just sit there and look at them.
[1:23:17] But not in this place. You know why? Cuz
[1:23:19] there's some anointed believers that saw
[1:23:20] the same thing the preacher saw that the
[1:23:22] son of man has been revealed in this age
[1:23:24] and they recognize the spirit of Janice
[1:23:27] and Jammer that would try to discredit
[1:23:29] and disprove and to push him aside. But
[1:23:31] brother David Paul, we're believers. So
[1:23:33] we stand on our feet and say, "I see
[1:23:35] your spirit in the Bible. I'm not
[1:23:37] discouraged that I can stand and I can
[1:23:39] go the next day." And the next day, just
[1:23:41] as God has ordained it in this age, I'm
[1:23:43] not discouraged by what the devil does
[1:23:45] because I see in the Bible it was
[1:23:47] prophesied he would do that very thing.
[1:23:51] &gt;&gt; He said, "We need a word, an opening of
[1:23:53] the word that lives."
[1:23:56] &gt;&gt; Said, "Well, why are there men like
[1:23:58] Janice and Jambers? Why are there false
[1:24:00] prophets and teachers teaching people
[1:24:02] away from the word? And why are they
[1:24:04] anointed to do that?" Let me tell you
[1:24:06] this. There's a reason why the devil
[1:24:08] don't want you to preach the opening of
[1:24:09] the word. He don't want you to preach
[1:24:11] that these seals have been revealed that
[1:24:13] this is an open book. Let me go ahead
[1:24:15] and tell you. I'm going to tell you
[1:24:16] something good. But let me tell you why
[1:24:17] he don't want you to preach it. I know
[1:24:20] what they say because I've heard them
[1:24:21] say, "Well, you know, we just preach
[1:24:22] Jesus." Now, don't be don't be getting
[1:24:24] into some other stuff. Because we just
[1:24:26] preach Jesus, you know, and we preach
[1:24:28] Jesus, too. Matter of fact, we preach
[1:24:30] the cross more than anybody I know. We I
[1:24:32] I believe in the preaching of the cross.
[1:24:34] And this in this church, we may as well
[1:24:35] make it known to the world. We believe
[1:24:37] the preaching of the cross of Calvary. I
[1:24:39] believe that it that it takes a man's
[1:24:41] sin and it buries him in the blood of
[1:24:43] Calvary. I believe that it sets people
[1:24:45] free. And I believe that it delivers
[1:24:46] them and it sets the captives free and
[1:24:49] everything that that that the cross
[1:24:50] would do. We believe in the preaching of
[1:24:52] the cross. But notice that whenever you
[1:24:54] hear or read about the preaching of the
[1:24:56] cross, you'll find the preaching of the
[1:24:58] cross in John's revelation. Revelation
[1:25:00] is the first chapter. You'll see the
[1:25:01] preaching of the cross. But you'll also
[1:25:03] find in Revelations the 5th chapter the
[1:25:06] opening of the word. Now watch happens.
[1:25:08] And in both both places it it's
[1:25:10] preached. Revelations 1 and5 it said,
[1:25:12] "And from Jesus Christ who is the
[1:25:14] faithful witness, the first begotten of
[1:25:15] the dead." I'm going to show you why the
[1:25:16] devil don't want you to preach the
[1:25:17] opening of the word. Jesus Christ who is
[1:25:20] a faithful witness, the first begotten
[1:25:21] of the dead, the prince of the kings of
[1:25:22] the earth. Unto him that loved us and
[1:25:25] washed us and which means loosed us from
[1:25:27] our sins by his own blood. Is that not
[1:25:29] the message of the cross? unto him that
[1:25:31] loved us and washed us by his own blood.
[1:25:34] He loosed us from our sins. That's the
[1:25:36] preaching of the cross. And listen what
[1:25:38] John said it done. And he hath made us
[1:25:40] kings and priests unto God and his
[1:25:42] father. And to him be glory and dominion
[1:25:47] forever and ever. That's Revelations 16.
[1:25:50] I thought they had that scripture back
[1:25:51] there. But but unto him be glory and
[1:25:54] dominion forever and ever. So notice the
[1:25:56] preaching of the cross. He said it makes
[1:25:58] us kings and priests, but to him be
[1:26:00] glory and dominion. Now watch what
[1:26:01] Revelations 5 and N. It says, remember
[1:26:04] this is whenever the opening of the word
[1:26:05] or the the the the the found that was
[1:26:08] worthy to take the book and to loose the
[1:26:10] seals. The Bible says they sung a new
[1:26:12] song saying, "Thou art worthy to take
[1:26:14] the book and to open the seals thereof.
[1:26:16] For thou was slain and hast redeemed us
[1:26:18] to God by thy blood out of every kindred
[1:26:21] and every tongue and people and nation."
[1:26:23] And watch the very same words. And hath
[1:26:26] made us unto our gods, kings and
[1:26:29] priests. But here this next line is
[1:26:31] different. And now we shall reign upon
[1:26:34] the earth. So in Revelations 1, which
[1:26:36] was the preaching of the cross, it says
[1:26:38] to him be glory and dominion forever.
[1:26:41] But in Revelations 5, which was the
[1:26:43] opening of the word, it says, "And we
[1:26:45] shall reign upon the earth." So the
[1:26:47] preaching of the cross shows the
[1:26:48] dominion of Jesus Christ and his
[1:26:51] dominion over every believer and his
[1:26:53] dominion over sin, his dominion over
[1:26:55] sickness. But whenever you preach the
[1:26:57] preaching or the opening of the word of
[1:26:59] God, what it done, I tell you what my
[1:27:01] Bible said. My Bible said it brought it
[1:27:03] brought dominion unto the believer till
[1:27:05] they said we shall reign upon the earth.
[1:27:08] Let me tell you what it does this
[1:27:09] morning. The opening of the word brings
[1:27:11] dominion to the believer. It brings
[1:27:13] power to the believer that not just
[1:27:15] Jesus has power over the devil, but the
[1:27:17] believer that has received the opening.
[1:27:19] That's why brother Brandon must say we
[1:27:21] need an opening of the word that lives.
[1:27:22] I don't need one THAT'S DEAD. I DON'T
[1:27:24] need some dead god or some dead
[1:27:26] religion, but we need the word of God to
[1:27:29] be open in our heart that we could come
[1:27:31] alive in this day that the power of God
[1:27:33] would be manifested out of our life.
[1:27:36] Jesus ain't the only one who has power
[1:27:37] over the devils. But that son of God who
[1:27:40] the word has been revealed to has
[1:27:42] dominion upon this earth. We shall reign
[1:27:44] upon this earth. He has power over every
[1:27:46] devil. You have power over every
[1:27:48] sickness because of the blood that Jesus
[1:27:50] shed. But I'm just showing you what's
[1:27:52] been revealed in this hour. It ain't
[1:27:54] just going to Mary and calling upon an
[1:27:56] intercessor and oh Mary, sweet Mary, can
[1:27:58] you call upon Jesus and ask him that he
[1:28:01] could come and do me a favor? BUT IT
[1:28:03] AIN'T THAT any longer. But it's to bring
[1:28:05] the believer to their position in
[1:28:07] Christ. It's to bring the son of God to
[1:28:09] recognize who he is that he don't have
[1:28:11] to go beg and plead and talk and try and
[1:28:13] try to work things out with God to make
[1:28:15] something happen. But because he knows
[1:28:17] who he is and because he knows where he
[1:28:20] stands and the word has been revealed
[1:28:22] unto him. It positionally places the
[1:28:24] believer in his place over the devil.
[1:28:27] &gt;&gt; It gives you dominion upon the earth
[1:28:29] that he shall reign upon the earth. And
[1:28:31] friends, let me just tell you there was
[1:28:33] that that's where dominion is found is
[1:28:35] in the opening of the word. Can I ask
[1:28:37] you what ministry or what church or what
[1:28:39] denomination ever gave you dominion over
[1:28:42] the earth?
[1:28:44] &gt;&gt; Somebody answer me that what what what
[1:28:47] church ever gave you dominion? What what
[1:28:49] denomination ever give you dominion?
[1:28:51] That your dominion is not found in any
[1:28:53] of that. A matter of fact, according to
[1:28:55] the Bible, there ain't nothing outside
[1:28:56] of the message that God would speak
[1:28:58] through the mouth of a seventh church
[1:28:59] age messenger. Revelations 5. There
[1:29:02] ain't nothing that would ever There
[1:29:03] ain't nothing that would bring dominion
[1:29:05] to the church outside of that.
[1:29:06] &gt;&gt; It's what puts you in your place and
[1:29:08] it's what puts the devil in his.
[1:29:11] &gt;&gt; Amen. It's what? There's a reason why
[1:29:13] you had to catch a revelation. This word
[1:29:15] has been open to you.
[1:29:17] &gt;&gt; It was open to place you in your
[1:29:19] position in God that you don't that
[1:29:21] you're not just a a church member.
[1:29:23] You're not just going to some church or
[1:29:25] whichever one makes you feel good. There
[1:29:27] there's a real revelation. And there's a
[1:29:28] reason why God done the the the the
[1:29:30] supernatural signs in the presence of
[1:29:32] the people. It was to call it was to
[1:29:34] attract people to uh to the to the the
[1:29:37] presence of the son of man. What was
[1:29:38] about to be revealed. But you watch his
[1:29:41] first coming. Brother Mark, you notice
[1:29:42] it was written in the scriptures. He
[1:29:44] came. You know what happened? Most
[1:29:45] people missed him. You know why? Because
[1:29:46] they were looking for the wrong thing.
[1:29:48] &gt;&gt; The religious world, they overlooked his
[1:29:50] first coming because they were looking
[1:29:51] for some great big thing in the sky. But
[1:29:53] there was a little woman that was going
[1:29:55] down to a well one day and all she was
[1:29:57] looking for was a refreshing. She was
[1:29:59] going down for a little refreshment. But
[1:30:01] she came to the well and she met Jesus
[1:30:03] there. And when she met Jesus, he said
[1:30:05] he began to discern her heart. And that
[1:30:07] one little sign of discernment was
[1:30:09] enough for her to say, "I know that when
[1:30:11] the Messiah comes, he would do these
[1:30:13] things. Don't let that spirit of Janice
[1:30:15] and Jambers take that away from you. I
[1:30:17] know. I I said, "Don't let that spirit
[1:30:18] of I I know I'm fighting against it this
[1:30:20] morning because I can feel it fighting
[1:30:21] back." But he's a liar. It's a devil out
[1:30:24] of the pits of hell that would try to
[1:30:25] take your faith away from the message of
[1:30:27] the hour that God has sending. THERE
[1:30:29] AIN'T NOTHING ELSE THAT brings dominion
[1:30:31] over the devil outside of this message
[1:30:33] that God has sent in this hour. I'm
[1:30:35] reading it to you right out of my own
[1:30:36] Bible. Somebody ought to say, "Amen."
[1:30:38] You preachers ought to say, "Y'all help
[1:30:40] me out a little bit this morning." If
[1:30:41] you don't believe it, well, then what
[1:30:42] are you doing in THIS CHURCH? THAT'S
[1:30:44] WHAT WE BELIEVE THIS MORNING. And I
[1:30:45] believe that God has came in this hour
[1:30:47] and he brought a message to his
[1:30:48] children. And I thank God that we have a
[1:30:51] we have a right to speak it to our
[1:30:53] children that that they would be able to
[1:30:54] understand WHAT GOD IS DOING. That we're
[1:30:56] not just coming and having some religion
[1:30:58] and making up some religion for people
[1:31:00] to follow after or some church for
[1:31:02] people to follow after. But this is the
[1:31:04] word of the Lord.
[1:31:06] &gt;&gt; IF GOD EVER SPOKE A WORD THAT YOU EVER
[1:31:08] BELIEVE, it's a word of the Lord. It's
[1:31:10] been vindicated in this hour
[1:31:13] &gt;&gt; to be the truth of God's word. They
[1:31:15] always overlook his coming. They
[1:31:17] overlooked his coming. But it took a
[1:31:18] little woman. She said when the Messiah
[1:31:20] comes, he would do these things. When
[1:31:21] she seen the sign of the supernatural, I
[1:31:24] thought, "Isn't that something?" All she
[1:31:25] seen was a sign of a supernatural. One
[1:31:27] little sign and that's all it took. And
[1:31:29] you know where she went with it? She
[1:31:30] went right and said, "When the Messiah
[1:31:32] comes, won't he do those things?" Today,
[1:31:34] when people see a sign of the
[1:31:35] supernatural, what do they do? Because
[1:31:37] they're unbelievers, they say, "Well, I
[1:31:39] don't believe that." And you know, I
[1:31:40] think that was that was this. And you
[1:31:42] know, I'm not so sure about that. When
[1:31:44] they see the sign of a supernatural, it
[1:31:46] causes all kinds of thoughts to come to
[1:31:48] all kinds of people. But look what kind
[1:31:50] of thought it brought to the woman at
[1:31:52] the well because she was predestinated
[1:31:54] of God to be a believer. She was looking
[1:31:56] for the sign of his coming. She cared
[1:31:59] about the prophecies of the age she was
[1:32:01] living in. She studied on it. She had
[1:32:03] heard about it. She knew about it. And
[1:32:05] when she met him AND SHE SAW THAT IT
[1:32:07] took place, she said, "This is the the
[1:32:09] very thing that the Messiah would do
[1:32:11] whenever he came." I wonder how many
[1:32:13] today that have been taught, right? That
[1:32:15] have been raised up, right? To look for
[1:32:17] the sign of the age that they live in
[1:32:19] and looking for the sign of his coming.
[1:32:21] We're not looking for a Jesus on a
[1:32:22] cloud. We're not looking for a great big
[1:32:24] 100 foot tall Jesus. We're not looking
[1:32:27] for him to be born in a manger. We're
[1:32:29] not looking, but we're looking for the
[1:32:30] right sign. And we're looking in the age
[1:32:32] that we're living in, the prophets that
[1:32:34] are that are concerning our age, the
[1:32:36] very scriptures that a denominational
[1:32:38] church won't even preach because they
[1:32:40] don't understand it. But the believer is
[1:32:42] looking for that very thing to come to
[1:32:44] pass. And that's why you see it and they
[1:32:47] don't
[1:32:48] &gt;&gt; because you're looking for that
[1:32:50] scripture to come to pass. So when you
[1:32:52] see something that fulfills that
[1:32:54] scripture that you're looking to come to
[1:32:56] pass there, your eyes come open and you
[1:32:59] say, "I see it. I've been looking for
[1:33:00] that. Didn't the Messiah, it don't take
[1:33:02] a great big thing. You know what it
[1:33:04] took, Sister Destiny? It took one little
[1:33:06] sign in front of that woman to cause her
[1:33:08] to go into town and say, "Come see a man
[1:33:11] that told me all that I've ever done."
[1:33:13] It don't take a great big move of God.
[1:33:15] It don't take a great big sign to take
[1:33:17] the bride of Jesus Christ and cause her
[1:33:20] to be a believer because she's watching
[1:33:22] for it. She's looking for it. And Satan
[1:33:24] is doing everything he can to try to
[1:33:25] keep her from seeing it. But she's
[1:33:27] watching for the sign of his coming. I
[1:33:29] know many has missed it, but let me tell
[1:33:31] you who hadn't missed it. That little
[1:33:32] woman at the well didn't miss it. And
[1:33:34] this little woman here today didn't miss
[1:33:35] it either. When she saw the sign of his
[1:33:37] coming, she knew how it would be. She
[1:33:39] knew how it was prophesied. And when she
[1:33:41] saw it, she went forth saying, "Come and
[1:33:44] see a man that knew everything that I
[1:33:46] ever done." I tell you what it was. It
[1:33:48] was a public revealing of the son of man
[1:33:50] in this age. He wasn't preaching to to
[1:33:52] to build up a name. He wasn't preaching
[1:33:55] to build up a ministry. He wasn't
[1:33:56] preaching to build up a following. He
[1:33:58] wasn't preaching to build up a prophet.
[1:34:00] He was preaching to make known the
[1:34:02] public who the son of man was. That in
[1:34:04] this age, in this Exodus age, the only
[1:34:07] thing that could ever lead you out of
[1:34:08] this world or age of Leoa into a
[1:34:11] rapture, it would come through the
[1:34:13] message of the hour.
[1:34:16] &gt;&gt; But thank God that there are some
[1:34:18] witnesses that saw it.
[1:34:20] &gt;&gt; So, Satan's trying to do everything he
[1:34:22] can to keep you from seeing it. He keeps
[1:34:24] you from seeing the true revelation of
[1:34:25] the faith of God's word being revealed
[1:34:27] and vindicated today. He said, "How does
[1:34:28] he do it?" By teaching it out of you
[1:34:31] &gt;&gt; by schools and libraries and literature
[1:34:33] and hospitals. Said he's trying to teach
[1:34:35] it out of people. He said he'll do
[1:34:37] anything so that you won't look at that
[1:34:39] and see that it's Jesus Christ.
[1:34:42] &gt;&gt; Isn't that a powerful statement? He'll
[1:34:44] do he'll call it anything. Said because
[1:34:46] he knows it. That's what the Bible said.
[1:34:48] In the beginning was the word. The word
[1:34:49] was with God. The word was God. The word
[1:34:51] was made flesh and dwelt among us. You
[1:34:54] see, so the very and same thing that
[1:34:56] happened when Jesus was here. Anything
[1:34:58] to say that it wasn't God.
[1:35:01] &gt;&gt; Same thing today. Anything to say that
[1:35:03] it wasn't Jesus Christ. He said he'll
[1:35:04] cause you to look at anything to say so
[1:35:07] that you will look at that and not think
[1:35:09] it was Jesus Christ. He said, but he's
[1:35:11] the word. And in this age, he said that
[1:35:12] this would take place in this age. And
[1:35:14] now here it is happening. How many say
[1:35:16] amen?
[1:35:17] &gt;&gt; Now here it is happening. He's trying
[1:35:19] his best to keep you from seeing that.
[1:35:21] And how how will he do it? Said he'll
[1:35:23] tack every dirty name onto it he can.
[1:35:26] He'll call him holy rollers, call them
[1:35:28] everything else. He called Jesus be
[1:35:30] elabub. He said, "Why?" Because Satan's
[1:35:31] trying to keep you from seeing the real
[1:35:33] meaning of the message of the hour. He's
[1:35:35] trying to keep you from seeing the real
[1:35:36] meaning of the word. He said, "Well,
[1:35:38] what does the word mean?" He said, "It
[1:35:39] means that it's the time the exodus is
[1:35:42] at hand. The word for this age, the
[1:35:44] evening light being interpreted, the
[1:35:46] mysteries being revealed in this age is
[1:35:48] for one purpose. It's to prove to the
[1:35:50] church that the exodus is at hand.
[1:35:53] &gt;&gt; It's to make preparation in the hearts
[1:35:56] of the believers.
[1:35:57] &gt;&gt; It's to make you ready for a rapture.
[1:35:59] You know, maybe maybe you look at it and
[1:36:01] you don't see that, but you know,
[1:36:02] sometimes you have to look at something
[1:36:04] more than once in order to see it.
[1:36:06] &gt;&gt; Remember what happened to Ahab and or or
[1:36:08] Elijah in the days of Ahab? They they
[1:36:11] they they they came down. He said, "I
[1:36:13] hear the sound of an abundance of rain.
[1:36:14] There had been a great famine in the
[1:36:16] land." But but Elijah told the his
[1:36:18] servant, he said, "Go out and look
[1:36:19] towards the sea." He said, he said,
[1:36:21] "Look toward the sea and come back and
[1:36:23] tell me what you see." And he came back
[1:36:25] and he said, "I don't see nothing." He
[1:36:26] said, "But I heard the sound of an
[1:36:28] abundance of rain." Now, he's going back
[1:36:29] and he's looking for a vindication of
[1:36:31] it. He went back again the second time,
[1:36:33] Brother Mark. He came back. He said,
[1:36:34] "What did you see?" I didn't see
[1:36:35] nothing. He went back again the third
[1:36:37] time. He said, "What did you see?" "I
[1:36:38] didn't see nothing." Went back the
[1:36:39] fourth time. It took seven times for him
[1:36:41] going out and looking to the sea. Before
[1:36:43] he came back, he said, "I see a cloud
[1:36:45] the size of a man's hand." I thought,
[1:36:48] "Isn't this powerful that in the middle
[1:36:49] of a drought, he was looking for a
[1:36:51] supernatural sign." Isn't that where we
[1:36:53] are in the middle of a spiritual
[1:36:54] drought, in the middle of Leoa, when the
[1:36:56] very spirit of God, it seemed to be
[1:36:58] pressed down and everything is fake and
[1:37:00] every everything's phony and an
[1:37:02] impersonation. But in the middle of all
[1:37:04] that spiritual drought, he was looking
[1:37:06] for a sign. He was looking for
[1:37:08] something, some kind of supernatural
[1:37:10] sign. And let me tell you what he done
[1:37:12] when he came in there to Elijah and he
[1:37:13] said, "I see a cloud the size of a man's
[1:37:15] hand." But said, "You notice what he
[1:37:17] done? He accepted the first little move
[1:37:20] that he saw." He said, "But it wasn't it
[1:37:22] didn't take much. It was just a little
[1:37:24] bit of a move." He said, "That's enough
[1:37:26] to make me a believer." You know what
[1:37:27] unbelief says? The unbeliever says, "I
[1:37:29] need a bigger sign." The unbeliever
[1:37:31] says, "I need more proof." The
[1:37:32] unbeliever says, "I need more prophecy."
[1:37:34] That one little prophecy ain't enough. I
[1:37:36] need you to show me more. I need
[1:37:37] something else. I need something else. I
[1:37:39] need something else. Because it's a
[1:37:41] spirit of unbelief. He said, but the
[1:37:43] believer, notice what Ahab or Elijah
[1:37:45] done when he saw that, he accepted the
[1:37:48] first little move and accepted it to be
[1:37:50] God. Oh, I thank God what he what he
[1:37:52] done. You know why? Because he said
[1:37:54] whenever he saw it, he knew the only
[1:37:56] thing that could cause rain to come in
[1:37:58] the drought, it would be the hand of God
[1:38:00] to do it. And when he came in and said,
[1:38:02] "I see the I see the size of a man's
[1:38:04] hand." He said that's what it would take
[1:38:06] anyway. It'll take the hand of God to
[1:38:08] bring rain. And he accepted that little
[1:38:10] move. And brother Bam said when you see
[1:38:12] if you when you come this morning, he
[1:38:14] said they get all scooped up the spirit
[1:38:16] of God. May it open your eyes this
[1:38:18] morning that when you would come back
[1:38:20] and not believe creeds instead of the
[1:38:22] word, but come back to the word and just
[1:38:24] see the first little move of God and let
[1:38:27] your faith accept it. He said, "We're
[1:38:29] looking for the coming of the Lord." We
[1:38:31] look at the Holy Ghost followed in the
[1:38:33] last days. We look at signs and wonders.
[1:38:35] We watch what's taking place. See, don't
[1:38:37] you see what you're looking at? That's
[1:38:39] exactly what God said would take place.
[1:38:42] So, let your faith grab it and say, "I
[1:38:44] want it, too."
[1:38:46] &gt;&gt; I wonder how many this morning you can
[1:38:47] stand to your feet as the music players
[1:38:49] come. I wonder how many this morning
[1:38:51] that could be like be like Elijah was
[1:38:54] that day and let your faith grab it and
[1:38:56] say, "I want it, too." It didn't take
[1:38:58] some great big move. It don't
[1:39:00] Everybody's looking for a great move.
[1:39:01] They're looking for the church to be
[1:39:02] shouting all over the building to to
[1:39:04] recognize that God's in their midst or
[1:39:06] or or they're they're looking for some
[1:39:07] something. It's got to be lifted up by
[1:39:09] music or all these things to to
[1:39:10] recognize God is in your midst. He said,
[1:39:12] "But all they did was took the first
[1:39:14] move."
[1:39:15] &gt;&gt; One little thing and he got a hold of
[1:39:17] it. Let me tell you where he went. He
[1:39:19] said, "Get a hold of it by faith." Let
[1:39:21] your faith
[1:39:22] &gt;&gt; get a f hold of the first little move.
[1:39:24] &gt;&gt; I watched that young lady right there
[1:39:26] just come into our tent meeting here a
[1:39:28] few days ago. Never heard nothing about
[1:39:30] this message. About a month ago, she
[1:39:31] came into the meeting. She walked right
[1:39:33] in there and seen a little bit of move
[1:39:35] of God. She sat on my couch and
[1:39:36] testified. She don't mind if I tell her
[1:39:38] testimony. She sat on my couch and
[1:39:40] testified, "I've been looking for
[1:39:41] something that was real."
[1:39:43] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:39:44] &gt;&gt; And she saw a move of God and accepted
[1:39:46] one little move to be the word of the
[1:39:48] Lord. [applause] And don't you think
[1:39:52] that that spirit that Paul prophesied of
[1:39:55] isn't following her around
[1:39:58] &gt;&gt; just like it follows you?
[1:40:00] Don't believe this. Don't believe that.
[1:40:02] Don't follow this. Anointed. Paul said
[1:40:05] men. Men that would lead astray silly
[1:40:09] women.
[1:40:11] False prophets. What Jesus called them.
[1:40:13] False Christ and false prophets that
[1:40:14] would arise in this age. Let me tell
[1:40:16] you, Elijah took a hold of that little
[1:40:19] move of God. The Bible said he ran. He
[1:40:22] got so inspired that he ran before Ahab
[1:40:26] to the entrance of Jezrael.
[1:40:29] took him. It put a revival in his heart.
[1:40:31] Brother Mark, he ran. But remember said,
[1:40:33] "Take it by faith. Take that little move
[1:40:34] of God that God gave you by faith and
[1:40:37] accepted to be the Lord."
[1:40:38] &gt;&gt; Now, when you accept it to be the Lord,
[1:40:40] see what God does with it.
[1:40:42] &gt;&gt; Talking about changing somebody's life.
[1:40:45] &gt;&gt; Accept a little that little move to be
[1:40:47] God
[1:40:49] &gt;&gt; and see what God does with the life.
[1:40:51] Said just take it by faith and run with
[1:40:53] it.
[1:40:54] &gt;&gt; Isn't it something Elijah, he went down
[1:40:55] to Jezrael? How many knows what Jezel
[1:40:57] means? It's the valley of sewing. The
[1:41:01] name Jezrael.
[1:41:02] This is where Elijah runs to. I thought,
[1:41:05] isn't that something? Because Boam said,
[1:41:06] "Let be like Elijah and take your faith
[1:41:10] and get a hold of it and just run like
[1:41:12] Elijah ran." I thought something. If we
[1:41:14] could take a take a hold of that little
[1:41:16] move of God by faith and run like Elijah
[1:41:18] down into Jezrael into the valley of Sen
[1:41:21] [music]
[1:41:22] and plant that little seed of faith.
[1:41:24] Think about where we're going. Isn't
[1:41:25] that what Jesus said? If you had the
[1:41:27] faith that was a grain of a mustard
[1:41:29] seed, you could say to this mountain,
[1:41:30] "Remove and it shall remove and nothing
[1:41:33] shall be impossible to you." It wasn't a
[1:41:36] great big seed. It was the smallest seed
[1:41:37] there was. But when you get a hold of it
[1:41:40] and you can take it into the valley of
[1:41:41] sewing, a little move of God by faith,
[1:41:44] and you could take it by the mark and
[1:41:45] plant it in your life, and all of a
[1:41:47] sudden it begins to grow something
[1:41:48] greater. You may not understand it all.
[1:41:51] You may not understand all the mysteries
[1:41:53] of God being revealed. You [music] may
[1:41:55] listen to the seven seal 10 times and
[1:41:57] you may you may not see it all. You may
[1:41:59] not understand everything the prophet
[1:42:00] says, but [music] don't don't just
[1:42:02] because you don't understand something
[1:42:03] or don't see it or didn't see it the
[1:42:05] first time that you heard it. Don't let
[1:42:06] Janice and Jambers come in and rob you
[1:42:08] of it.
[1:42:10] &gt;&gt; Just keep going back until you see it.
[1:42:13] Go back to the sea and look toward the
[1:42:15] sea. This is the best advice I could
[1:42:17] give you this morning. Just keep going
[1:42:19] back, oh servant, and look towards the
[1:42:22] sea and tell me what you see. [music]
[1:42:24] It may take seven times to going back
[1:42:26] and seeing it before you come and all of
[1:42:28] a sudden you realize revelation comes
[1:42:30] [music] through your whole life. I
[1:42:32] honestly believe this. I still believe
[1:42:34] that the day that the Lord comes that
[1:42:36] we'll still be getting revelation. I
[1:42:38] believe that. I believe we'll still have
[1:42:40] trouble. We'll still have trials. We'll
[1:42:42] be mad at the job wishing we didn't have
[1:42:45] to go back to work tomorrow. The very
[1:42:47] day that he comes, we'll still be going
[1:42:49] through that. There ain't no there's no
[1:42:51] there's no premillennial millennium in
[1:42:53] the natural.
[1:42:55] Y'all understand what I'm saying there?
[1:42:57] We're still in the flesh. We're still
[1:42:59] going to battle the flesh. We're We're
[1:43:01] still going to go through these things.
[1:43:02] We're still getting revelation. We're
[1:43:03] still growing in the word. You're still
[1:43:05] the day the Lord comes, there'll be many
[1:43:07] that rapture from this earth that in
[1:43:10] their heart think that they ain't even
[1:43:12] far enough along with God to go in a
[1:43:14] rapture. I really believe that. There'll
[1:43:17] be many that will go in a rapture.
[1:43:19] They think, you know, I don't understand
[1:43:21] this. I don't see everything. And then
[1:43:24] there'll be many that think they know
[1:43:26] everything, they'll never even go.
[1:43:29] I'm just telling you. But as a believer,
[1:43:31] just keep going back and looking. And
[1:43:34] then when you see a little move of God,
[1:43:36] take it and plant it. Go back and look
[1:43:39] some more. Get another seed of faith and
[1:43:42] come back to the valley of sewing and
[1:43:44] plant it again. Before long, you'll have
[1:43:46] a garden of things that [music] have
[1:43:48] been planted in your life that that it
[1:43:51] don't matter what kind of spirit would
[1:43:52] come in. remember the mark to to try to
[1:43:54] discredit or to push you out of it. Say,
[1:43:56] you know what? I'm right where God
[1:43:57] wanted me to be this morning. I'm right
[1:43:59] where God called me. This ain't it ain't
[1:44:02] some madeup thing. I'm right where God
[1:44:04] I've seen God God's changed my life with
[1:44:06] this message. He's changed my my heart.
[1:44:08] He saved my family. He [music] it ain't
[1:44:11] separate from the cross. It's because of
[1:44:14] the cross that we have this this
[1:44:15] morning. It's because of the cross I can
[1:44:18] preach this message this morning to
[1:44:20] bring
[1:44:22] dominion to the church.
[1:44:25] So it don't take a great move when Mark
[1:44:27] was talking about Charles and Vanna, a
[1:44:29] little testimony or something that
[1:44:31] happened in their house. I don't even
[1:44:32] remember what he was talking about, but
[1:44:34] something that happened at their house,
[1:44:36] but it was something that was big enough
[1:44:38] in their home that was just some little
[1:44:41] move of God that was enough to bring
[1:44:43] faith. David Paul praying about
[1:44:46] something talking to his wife about it
[1:44:48] in the car and come in the house of God
[1:44:50] [music] and the Lord began to speak on
[1:44:51] it and go out the next day at the job
[1:44:53] and the very thing that God was speaking
[1:44:55] to him about he manifested right in
[1:44:57] front of them may not be a great thing
[1:44:59] to the world but they accepted the
[1:45:01] little move of God and they planted it
[1:45:03] in their valley of sewing
[1:45:06] and look what it's bringing to pass the
[1:45:07] life that is that is that is following
[1:45:10] the word of God that that that God is
[1:45:13] growing in I I've seen so much growth in
[1:45:15] that young man. Well, I I couldn't be
[1:45:18] any prouder than to see what God is
[1:45:19] doing in his and his wife's life few
[1:45:22] years ago. And they just just that Satan
[1:45:24] would do anything he can just [music] to
[1:45:26] struggle to keep him from from being
[1:45:28] here. But I watched him. I watched
[1:45:29] whenever God got a hold of him. I
[1:45:31] watched when God got a hold of her. And
[1:45:32] it's a supernatural thing. This ain't
[1:45:35] something that you can discredit.
[1:45:36] Listen, Janice and Jambers. It ain't
[1:45:38] something you can discredit. It's a real
[1:45:39] thing. This is a supernatural thing that
[1:45:42] took place in their life. It may not be
[1:45:44] some great big thing to the world, but
[1:45:45] it's supernatural. Took place in that
[1:45:48] young lady's life that caused her to
[1:45:49] want to serve God. Many here that none
[1:45:53] hundreds that have been saved just from
[1:45:56] the time that we've had our little
[1:45:57] church.
[1:45:59] Hundreds that have been baptized.
[1:46:02] men going out and serving the Lord and
[1:46:05] winning souls and witnessing and
[1:46:07] baptizing them in lakes and rivers and
[1:46:09] ponds and churches wherever wherever
[1:46:11] they'll wherever they'll let us baptize
[1:46:13] them, trying to win souls to the kingdom
[1:46:15] of God. And allow people to see
[1:46:18] something that's real. That's what I
[1:46:20] want you to see this morning. Don't be
[1:46:22] discouraged about the things that are
[1:46:25] going on around you, for they were
[1:46:27] prophesied that they would [music] take
[1:46:28] place.
[1:46:30] be like Moses and Aaron and just go in
[1:46:31] the next day and say, "But they're
[1:46:33] fulfilling prophecy." I knew it would
[1:46:35] take place in this age. It's a
[1:46:37] fulfillment of prophecy, but I won't be
[1:46:39] led astray. I won't be led aside. I I
[1:46:42] see that spirit as it moves into homes
[1:46:44] [music] and into people's living rooms.
[1:46:46] And isn't it something? He said they
[1:46:48] would go into homes and [music] lead
[1:46:50] captive silly women that could be led
[1:46:52] astray. But friends, I've got news for
[1:46:54] you. Just because you read that, don't
[1:46:56] you don't say you're a silly woman.
[1:46:59] We're not silly women.
[1:47:01] &gt;&gt; There may be a world full of silly
[1:47:03] women, but you're not a silly woman.
[1:47:04] You're a daughter of God. You're a son
[1:47:07] of God. And so that isn't it something?
[1:47:09] But the Bible never says that that
[1:47:10] spirit could lead astray the son of God
[1:47:12] or the daughter of God. It never led
[1:47:14] them anywhere. Why? Because they
[1:47:16] recognized what it was
[1:47:18] &gt;&gt; and they were able to withstand it
[1:47:20] because it was prophesied in this age.
[1:47:23] Friends, let me tell you this morning.
[1:47:26] He said just take what God gives you
[1:47:29] little bit at a time. Said Elijah kept
[1:47:32] believing. He said I hear the sound of
[1:47:34] an abundance of rain and that little
[1:47:35] cloud before long it became two clouds.
[1:47:38] Two clouds became a hill and a hill
[1:47:40] become a mountain and the mountain
[1:47:41] became another mountain. And first thing
[1:47:43] you know the whole skies were thundering
[1:47:44] and rain was following because he
[1:47:46] accepted what God sent. Isn't it
[1:47:49] something just to accept what God sent
[1:47:52] &gt;&gt; and to accept you be talking about
[1:47:53] something that'll settle your life. When
[1:47:55] you accept what God sent and accept
[1:47:57] where God sent you, it settles your
[1:48:00] life. All the confusion and unsettlness,
[1:48:02] not know where to go and what to do.
[1:48:03] When you can when you can just accept it
[1:48:05] that God brought me here. I may not know
[1:48:07] my purpose. I may not know exactly why
[1:48:10] sometime I I'm trying to find but I know
[1:48:12] that God brought me to this place. And
[1:48:14] then when you can accept that, then
[1:48:16] allow God to start working on your life.
[1:48:18] But said when he accepted it, he said
[1:48:20] his his life must have been renewed.
[1:48:22] When he accepted it as a move of God,
[1:48:25] said it just took a first move. I know
[1:48:28] of people today, they're looking for
[1:48:31] great big things.
[1:48:33] But can I just leave you with this this
[1:48:34] morning? It don't take a great big thing
[1:48:37] to a believer to accept it as being God.
[1:48:40] That's something that's been built up in
[1:48:42] people's minds. that that that it takes
[1:48:44] a certain a certain thing and to happen
[1:48:46] in order for it to be God. But that's
[1:48:48] not true. It don't always take a great
[1:48:50] big thing. And the devil knows it. And
[1:48:52] so he he brings little bitty things into
[1:48:55] our life to try to to try little bitty
[1:48:58] thoughts, little bitty seeds that are
[1:48:59] planted. Why? He's trying to upset the
[1:49:01] garden that God's growing. He's trying
[1:49:03] to plant other seeds in the garden that
[1:49:05] God's growing. He throws things out
[1:49:07] there, but you know what? They'll never
[1:49:09] take root.
[1:49:11] Isn't that true? Because this seed that
[1:49:13] God put, it won't be mixed with nothing
[1:49:15] else. They'll never take root. He may be
[1:49:16] trying to grow things up in your life,
[1:49:18] but it's artificial. It's fake. It won't
[1:49:20] be there very long. You just keep going
[1:49:22] back and taking every little move of God
[1:49:24] except the little thing. Don't miss the
[1:49:26] little things that God does.
[1:49:29] Don't miss little things that God does
[1:49:31] in your life. Little little signs that
[1:49:33] God does in your life. Little because
[1:49:34] [music] he's he's leading us and and he
[1:49:36] never he never neglects his children.
[1:49:39] You know, there was a great there was a
[1:49:41] great battle one time, a great war that
[1:49:42] was lost because of the tiniest of
[1:49:45] things. There was a [music] you remember
[1:49:47] the old proverb that was written about
[1:49:49] it. Remember they went in and they had
[1:49:51] sent a a rider with a message and said,
[1:49:54] "Go in there and they sent with the
[1:49:56] king's message and said this is uh what
[1:49:58] we have to do to win the battle." And so
[1:50:01] but but because the the rider went in
[1:50:03] and he wasn't able to make it to the
[1:50:05] battle because the horse threw its shoe
[1:50:09] and he wasn't able to make it to the
[1:50:10] battle. They wound up losing the war.
[1:50:12] When they wrote the proverb about it,
[1:50:14] they said, "For the want of a nail, a
[1:50:17] shoe was lost." See, it was a little
[1:50:19] thing. And for the one of a shoe, then a
[1:50:22] horse was lost. And for the one of a
[1:50:25] horse, a rider was lost. And for the one
[1:50:26] of a rider, the message was lost. And
[1:50:29] for the one of a message, the battle was
[1:50:31] lost. And for the one of a battle, the
[1:50:33] war was lost. Just one little thing. So,
[1:50:37] we don't want to miss it. We don't want
[1:50:39] to miss the little things that God
[1:50:41] [music] does or that God brings to us or
[1:50:43] or to overlook it. Isn't it something? A
[1:50:46] whole entire war was lost because
[1:50:47] somebody overlooked a nail in a horse's
[1:50:50] shoe. I thought, "But Lord, don't let me
[1:50:53] overlook the spirit in this age. Don't
[1:50:55] don't let me miss something great. Don't
[1:50:57] let me lose the battle and miss
[1:50:59] something great because of some little
[1:51:02] thing that I that I would overlook that
[1:51:05] the devil would try to to bring me past.
[1:51:07] But but I accept it. I accept it as a
[1:51:10] move of God. How many raise your hands
[1:51:12] this morning and say that I I accept
[1:51:14] this message as a move of God. I it
[1:51:18] wasn't even just a little thing. It was
[1:51:19] such a great big thing, but God just
[1:51:22] keeps reindicating it. Isn't it
[1:51:24] something that he does that? You know
[1:51:25] what that is? Can I tell you God don't
[1:51:27] have to do that, but it's the mercy of
[1:51:30] God that he vindicates that to your
[1:51:32] life. Brother David Paul, what happened
[1:51:34] to you at your work? That's just God's
[1:51:35] mercy that he would vindicate that in
[1:51:38] your life in such a way. It's his mercy.
[1:51:40] Why? Because he's trying to establish
[1:51:42] the faith of his children in this hour,
[1:51:44] in the age where there's such a pressure
[1:51:46] to cause you to disbelieve the word of
[1:51:48] God. But I just want to encourage you
[1:51:50] this morning, even the little things,
[1:51:53] don't over don't overlook what God does.
[1:51:56] Amen. You love the Lord this morning.
[1:51:59] How many can say he's worthy of it all?
[1:52:02] You're worthy of it all.
[1:52:09] You're worthy of it all. [music]
[1:52:16] For from you are all things.
[1:52:20] To you are all [singing and music]
[1:52:21] things.
