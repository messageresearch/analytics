[43:36] out of Romans in the ninth chapter and
[43:38] we'll start in the sixth verse and we'll
[43:41] read through the 16th verse brother Matt
[43:43] it's been a while since I saw you and
[43:45] God bless you you're and your wife and
[43:47] and I I don't know I I baptized him a
[43:49] few years ago about about four three or
[43:52] four years ago and so it's sure good to
[43:54] see you this morning I remember his wife
[43:56] was singing with the girls and and and
[43:58] sure sure has a wonderful Voice singing
[44:01] and I told the girl she has a high
[44:03] soprano voice we don't really have
[44:04] anybody here that has that so it's sure
[44:06] good to see you see you again God bless
[44:08] y'all me we want to read Romans the 9th
[44:10] chapter we'll start in the sixth verse
[44:13] and we're going to read through the 16th
[44:14] verse and uh and there's uh the Lord
[44:17] just kind of put this on my heart it's
[44:18] been a few weeks ago and U but but uh
[44:21] but we've had some ministers and and in
[44:24] and and so we just had the opportunity
[44:26] to get to this but the sixth verse the
[44:29] Bible says this is Apostle Paul not as
[44:32] though the word of God had taken none
[44:34] effect for they are not all Israel which
[44:37] are of Israel neither because they are
[44:40] the Seed of Abraham are they called
[44:41] children but in Isaac shall thy seed be
[44:44] called that is they which are the
[44:46] children of the flesh these are not the
[44:47] children of God but the children of the
[44:50] promise are counted for seed for This Is
[44:52] The Word of Promise at this time will I
[44:54] come to Sarah she shall have a son and
[44:57] not only this but when when Rebecca also
[44:59] had conceived by one even by Our Father
[45:01] Isaac for the children being not yet
[45:03] born neither having done any good or
[45:05] evil that the purpose of God according
[45:07] to election might stand not of works but
[45:10] of him that calleth it was said unto her
[45:13] that the Elder Shall Serve the younger
[45:15] here Paul's laying this out and
[45:16] establishing that before that these
[45:18] children were ever even born that God
[45:20] was speaking to their mother he says see
[45:23] it was said unto her the Elder Shall
[45:24] Serve the younger so is showing us that
[45:26] God knew something about them that their
[45:28] mama didn't know about them he knew
[45:30] something about them before they were
[45:31] ever born he knew what they would be he
[45:33] knew how that they would grow up he knew
[45:35] how uh that their that their life would
[45:37] be in the direction that they would go
[45:38] he said so he said to her the Elder
[45:41] Shall Serve the younger as it is written
[45:42] Jacob have I loved and Esau have I hated
[45:46] he said what shall we say then is there
[45:47] unrighteousness with God in other words
[45:49] is God unfair that he would choose one
[45:52] over another he said God forbid he said
[45:54] for he has said to Moses I will have
[45:56] mercy on whom I will have mercy and I
[45:58] will have compassion on whom I will have
[46:00] compassion so then it is not of him that
[46:03] willth nor of him that runneth but it's
[46:05] of God that showeth Mercy somebody say
[46:08] Amen we'll just ask the Lord to add his
[46:10] Blessing to the reading of the word as
[46:11] you take your seats and I want to speak
[46:13] on this subject this morning on being
[46:15] prepared unto Glory prepared unto Glory
[46:19] here Paul is speaking this and uh and
[46:22] we'll uh just jump right in here this
[46:24] morning and for the sake of time but
[46:26] here he is speaking this and uh as he is
[46:28] going through and he's he's speaking of
[46:30] the election of God or the purpose of
[46:32] God in our life and how many how many
[46:34] realize that you whenever you belong to
[46:36] God that you always belong to God Amen
[46:38] we I know we preach that and we but we
[46:40] want it established in the hearts of
[46:41] people that that that that were not just
[46:44] uh that we we didn't just happen up on
[46:46] this but we but we are by the election
[46:48] of God and God has a purpose for your
[46:50] life how many believes that there
[46:52] there's a purpose that God has for your
[46:54] life and you know what I think of this
[46:55] subject of election and the subject of
[46:57] God's purpose it always takes my mind
[46:59] back to the Book of Ruth and and how
[47:01] that that that the story of this young
[47:03] lady how many's read that lately when
[47:05] the the story of this young lady and how
[47:08] uh that that she had she had left out of
[47:10] or she had gone out into uh or married
[47:13] in in in Naomi's son and and Naomi's
[47:16] children had both passed away and and
[47:18] and and she had followed Naomi back into
[47:20] Bethlehem remember how the story had
[47:22] started out they had a famine in the
[47:23] land and they all all of her family had
[47:25] gone out and the sons had married after
[47:27] a little bit of sickness came the sons
[47:28] had passed on and now here was Naomi and
[47:31] two daughters-in-law and and and but but
[47:33] the Lord had brought a time when Naomi
[47:35] would go back into this land of
[47:37] Bethlehem and we realized that when Ruth
[47:39] had gone back in there that brother Mark
[47:41] that this was this story but said it was
[47:43] more than a love story most of us read
[47:45] it as it's a great love story and the
[47:46] theologians they say well it was a love
[47:48] story even many of them would say today
[47:50] that it don't even belong in the Bible
[47:51] it's just a it's just a love story he
[47:53] said but see but God wouldn't put
[47:54] nothing in the Bible that wasn't
[47:56] inspired see so when it when it was put
[47:58] there it was something that was inspired
[48:00] by God and he said it was matter of fact
[48:02] it was one of the most outstanding books
[48:04] that God had accepted to be able to be
[48:06] put in the Bible and the reason it was
[48:08] put in there is because it was inspired
[48:10] because there was a hidden revelation in
[48:12] it and and when you catch that hidden
[48:14] revelation or the real meaning it brings
[48:15] you close to God and so here we see this
[48:18] story brother Mark it wasn't just a love
[48:20] story it wasn't just that that this that
[48:22] she just uh happened to meet this it
[48:24] isn't something to a fairy tale about
[48:26] but but we realize that there that this
[48:28] story of Ruth is actually a type of the
[48:30] Bride of Jesus Christ today and I mean
[48:33] if you read through this story you'll
[48:34] find this to be the case that that that
[48:36] is such a perfect type of us but in the
[48:38] story of Ruth there are four parts to
[48:40] the story of Ruth there was a decision a
[48:42] labor and then rest and then reward
[48:44] those are the four parts as the story
[48:46] would break down and so the very life of
[48:49] a Believer we go through them same
[48:51] stages we come to a stage in our life
[48:53] there's a stage of decision there's a
[48:55] there's a Time of Labor there's a time
[48:56] of rest and then there's a time when
[48:58] you'd receed the Crown of Life and so we
[49:00] see this play out in this story of Ruth
[49:03] can I just kind of just go through this
[49:04] just just to lay a foundation this
[49:05] morning but when you see this laid out
[49:07] here Ruth was leaving and she was coming
[49:09] with Naomi y'all remember how the Naomi
[49:12] was going back into Bethlehem or in into
[49:14] Judea and the Bible says it was during
[49:16] Harvest Time and she would she would go
[49:17] back and and the reason she was going
[49:19] back brother Mark is because she was
[49:20] searching for something here she was
[49:22] searching for food and searching for uh
[49:24] satisfaction and she would she would go
[49:26] back into this town of Bethlehem and and
[49:29] and the Bible says as they went into
[49:31] this place that she called new or Naomi
[49:33] being an old lady and she called upon
[49:35] Ruth and she said go find somewhere that
[49:37] we can have food and go so she went out
[49:39] to glean it and to look for a field to
[49:41] glean it and I thought isn't it
[49:42] something that that Naomi didn't direct
[49:44] her to a field she said well you you
[49:45] just got you got to find food and so
[49:47] here Ruth just like each one of us she
[49:49] went out and she was searching for
[49:51] something that would be her satisfying
[49:53] portion she was searching for something
[49:55] that was would satisfy the hungering and
[49:57] the thirsting that was in our body and
[49:59] and brother Charles just like each one
[50:00] of us done she she went out I thought
[50:02] can you imagine Ruth that she went out
[50:04] Brother David and she went out searching
[50:06] for this that she passed by many fields
[50:08] and maybe she came by one and she sat
[50:10] down on the on the on the on the bench
[50:12] down there and she sat in this field and
[50:13] she looked but there was just something
[50:15] about it that she wasn't satisfied with
[50:16] the field and she went maybe a little
[50:18] bit farther and then she came by another
[50:20] field and by they had nice fences down
[50:22] the down the way and maybe some stone
[50:24] walls down there and it looked real good
[50:26] and there were there were a lot of of
[50:28] Reapers out in the field but there was
[50:29] just something about it that that it
[50:31] didn't draw her there was no attraction
[50:33] to her it it was something that didn't
[50:35] satisfy the longing that was in her
[50:37] heart brother Marshall she just kept on
[50:38] going she went border after border as
[50:41] she went along the journey searching for
[50:43] a place that she could find food and a
[50:45] place that she could find satisfaction a
[50:47] place that she could find rest and the
[50:49] Bible said all of a sudden as she came
[50:51] up on this field that belonged to Boaz
[50:54] that she just so happened up on this
[50:56] field I thought isn't it something that
[50:57] after all this walking and all this
[50:59] journey that God would put a field in
[51:02] her path that would satisfy the very
[51:04] hunger that was in her soul it was her
[51:06] satisfying portion as she was searching
[51:09] brother thearrow and she came by this
[51:10] field of Boaz all of a sudden there was
[51:12] something inside her that Drew her to
[51:14] the field of Boaz something pulled her
[51:17] to the field of Boaz friends it wasn't
[51:19] an accident that she came to this field
[51:21] but there was something on the inside of
[51:22] her that Drew her to this place she had
[51:25] been many places she went by many places
[51:28] but something inside her it drew her to
[51:30] this place you say what was it brother
[51:31] Matt that Drew her to the field of Boaz
[51:33] let me tell you what it was I'll make it
[51:35] easy for you it was the Divine Purpose
[51:38] of almighty God it was something on the
[51:40] inside of her it was God's purpose and
[51:42] the Very plan that he had for her life
[51:44] it wasn't in the city that she was born
[51:46] in it wasn't in the household that she
[51:48] was born under it wasn't the name that
[51:50] she was born to it wasn't her old
[51:52] husband but when she came by the field
[51:54] that belonged to Boaz there was
[51:56] something inside her that pulled her
[51:58] into that place it was the Divine
[52:00] Purpose of God you realiz you realize it
[52:02] didn't matter how far you go in this
[52:04] life it don't matter how many stops that
[52:06] you make along the road it do matter how
[52:08] many churches that you went to it don't
[52:10] matter how many denominations that you
[52:11] belong to but all of a sudden there'll
[52:13] come a time that there's something that
[52:15] you'll find that will satisfy the
[52:17] longing that is in your heart you see
[52:20] when God has a purpose for you isn't it
[52:22] something that God's purpose for her
[52:24] life had to come to pass
[52:25] all the circumstan I Won't Go the whole
[52:27] story but all the circumstances in her
[52:29] life happened that God's purpose would
[52:31] be able to come to pass do you realize
[52:33] that that's the same thing with every
[52:34] one of us today when God has a purpose
[52:36] somebody say this with me when God has a
[52:38] purpose then it must come to pass see
[52:41] that's God's purpose for us brother said
[52:43] God's purpose can never be defeated he
[52:45] said there's nothing can defeat it he
[52:47] said so happy that we ought to be today
[52:50] resting upon that beautiful revelation
[52:52] of the word of the Living God that there
[52:54] is neither things present nor things to
[52:56] come there's no sickness there's no
[52:58] sorrow there's no death there's no Peril
[53:01] there's nothing that can separate us
[53:03] from the purpose of the Living God
[53:05] somebody let that get established in
[53:06] your heart this morning that there ain't
[53:08] nothing in this world that could
[53:09] separate you from God's purpose he said
[53:12] what God has imagined in his mind and
[53:14] what he's purposed in his heart to bring
[53:15] to pass there's no demon somebody say no
[53:18] demon there's no power there's no
[53:21] there's nothing that can separate you
[53:22] from God's Great Immortal and Eternal
[53:25] plan we could establish our lives on
[53:28] that one point Brother David that God's
[53:30] purpose can never be defeated can
[53:32] somebody say that with me God's purpose
[53:35] can never be defeated that's how you
[53:37] establish your life you watch how here
[53:39] she was brother Mark she didn't even
[53:41] know what was going on something pulled
[53:43] her and she went into this field and all
[53:44] of a sudden while she was out there
[53:46] gending in the field here comes a man
[53:48] that the Bible would recognized him as
[53:49] the lord of the Harvest his name was
[53:52] Boaz and brother Mark when he came into
[53:54] the field and he laid eyes on her
[53:56] something in his heart reached out and
[53:58] he and he fell in love with her and he
[54:00] he came over to where she was and he
[54:02] began to show her what her true identity
[54:04] was remember the words that he spoke to
[54:06] her he said don't don't you go glean in
[54:07] any other field cuz everything you'll
[54:09] have need of is right here you don't
[54:11] have to worry about going out there and
[54:13] searching for something else and and
[54:14] digging in in some field somewhere and
[54:16] trying to find something to get by cuz
[54:18] everything your heart ever desires
[54:20] you'll find in this field he was the
[54:22] lord of the Harvest brother Mark it was
[54:24] his field he had the to give it and when
[54:26] he laid eyes on her he said everything
[54:28] that you have need of is laying in this
[54:30] place you stay in this field you you men
[54:33] y'all keep your hands off of her don't
[54:35] don't tamper with her there's a purpose
[54:37] for her life you realize brother Mark as
[54:40] he began to speak to her he revealed a
[54:42] purpose in her that she didn't even
[54:45] understand you realize that she didn't
[54:47] know Boaz was in love with her she
[54:49] didn't know it was love at first sight
[54:50] to him but there was a purpose in her he
[54:53] began to reveal she didn't even
[54:55] understand it it's what happened to
[54:56] every one of us as God begin to to feel
[54:59] us and he give us his word and you come
[55:01] come around and and you begin to dig
[55:03] into the word of God and brother Mark
[55:05] you'll glean a little bit here and glean
[55:06] a little there and you realize as God
[55:08] begins to speak to your heart the
[55:10] purpose that he has for you begins to be
[55:12] revealed even when you don't understand
[55:14] it he's revealing it little at a time
[55:16] you and then and then notice what she
[55:18] done just like every one of us done she
[55:20] turned the Bible says she turned and
[55:21] looked at him and she said why have I
[55:24] found Grace in thy sight what did I do
[55:27] differently than anybody else why would
[55:29] you give Grace unto me why have I found
[55:32] Grace in thy sight Mar then she goes
[55:35] back to Naomi and the Bible says that
[55:36] Naomi she be to tell Naomi everything
[55:39] that had happened you realize Naomi
[55:41] whenever Naomi heard it what did he tell
[55:42] you I could just hear what did he tell
[55:44] you he said stay in the field what did
[55:45] he tell you he said that he he he told
[55:47] the men not to not to not to bother with
[55:49] me and he oh oh don't you realize what's
[55:52] happening she begin to sh tell her
[55:54] brother B says see what was he said
[55:55] Naomi was the type of the Old Testament
[55:57] Church so she took her back to the law
[56:00] brother Mark and she began to explain to
[56:01] her that there's something more that
[56:03] there was meaning behind what he was
[56:05] doing that there was something more to
[56:07] it of him just giving her a little bit
[56:08] of barley but she took her back all the
[56:10] way in the Old Testament or or or or the
[56:12] Old Law of Moses and and may she begin
[56:15] to write or or to speak to her about it
[56:17] and say you know this is how God had
[56:19] ordered it that that if you would lose a
[56:22] a husband or or he would fall by the
[56:23] wayside that that would be a redeemer
[56:25] that would come maybe you got might lost
[56:27] and you gotten dead but there could be a
[56:29] kinsman redeemer that would come and he
[56:31] could purchase and he could take all
[56:32] your own debt and he could take you to
[56:34] be his wife and he he could raise
[56:36] children under thy name in order to
[56:38] restore you back to your rightful place
[56:40] and she began to preach to her the
[56:42] message of a kinsman redeemer and
[56:44] brother brother Mark you notice as she
[56:46] began to speak it to her her true
[56:47] identity began to be unveiled and God's
[56:49] purpose for the life of Ruth was
[56:51] unveiled and Y y'all know the rest of
[56:53] the story they they met they fell in
[56:54] love and and she went down she went down
[56:56] that night in the Harvest Flo I got to
[56:58] get to my message but she went down and
[57:00] she laid down his at his feet and and he
[57:03] covered her up with his cloak and and to
[57:05] let her know that she had been accepted
[57:07] and then he went down before the town
[57:08] and he married her and he made her his
[57:10] wife and no longer was she under the
[57:12] headship of Naomi but she came under the
[57:14] headship of Boaz here think about Naomi
[57:17] being this Old Testament leader he saids
[57:19] see notice notice brother Mark but but
[57:21] what caused it to happen is because
[57:23] where she was gleaning see where you're
[57:25] gleaning makes all the difference you
[57:27] you realize they went into Bethlehem
[57:29] they how manyan knows what Bethlehem
[57:30] means it means the bread of life and
[57:32] that's what happens when you come to the
[57:33] message of the hour you've been gleaning
[57:35] you've been you may have been searching
[57:37] for a place to glean but when you come
[57:38] to this message and you begin to glean
[57:40] out of it and you realize that that
[57:42] God's message it's Jesus Christ it's the
[57:44] very bread of life and when you begin to
[57:46] glean out of it notice because she was
[57:47] gleaning out of the right field that she
[57:49] met the lord of the Harvest the lord of
[57:51] the Harvest he wasn't in every field
[57:53] going around looking for somebody that
[57:54] could bring over to his field but he was
[57:56] the Lord over his own field and because
[57:58] she was gleaning in the right field she
[58:00] met the lord of the Harvest and it
[58:02] changed her whole life she glean that's
[58:04] what we do we'll glean brother Mah by
[58:06] bye bye we come in and we found the
[58:08] field that God had led us to you didn't
[58:10] find it by chance you did it wasn't an
[58:12] accident that you came to this field it
[58:13] wasn't an accident that this message was
[58:15] witnessed unto you but it was the very
[58:17] Divine Purpose of almighty God that you
[58:19] would be able to glean and you took a
[58:21] little bite here and a little bite there
[58:23] and your identity be to be revealed here
[58:25] and a little bit there until finally one
[58:27] day you met the very one that made the
[58:29] field the lord of the Harvest and he
[58:32] took her to be his own that's the same
[58:34] thing that we that happened to us today
[58:37] what what was it that brought you to
[58:38] this message anyhow most most people
[58:40] well well my mama my mama's one that may
[58:42] become or my friend they introduced me
[58:44] or or something else brought me but I
[58:46] can tell you what the Bible says how
[58:47] many believes the Bible he said Paul
[58:49] said the law was our school Master to
[58:51] bring us unto Christ it was the law that
[58:54] brought us here that we might be
[58:55] justified by faith but after faith is
[58:58] come we are no longer under the school
[59:00] Master see Naomi is the one that brought
[59:02] root to that place but whenever but
[59:04] whenever she met Boaz she she came under
[59:06] a different headship and Paul says see
[59:08] this law was our school Master we we've
[59:10] been raised up under this we've been it
[59:12] didn't matter where where you had heard
[59:14] it from but but we took this scripture
[59:16] and we were raised up into it but then
[59:18] one day you met the lord of the Harvest
[59:20] and Paul said and now we've justified by
[59:23] faith and after faith has come we're no
[59:25] longer under the school master I could
[59:27] preach a message on that this morning
[59:28] after faith has come friends after faith
[59:31] has come we're no longer bound by law
[59:33] after faith has come we're not bound by
[59:35] tradition after faith has come you're
[59:37] not bound by denominationalism after
[59:40] faith has come you're no longer bound by
[59:42] Superstition after faith has come you
[59:44] ain't Bound by feelings or emotion or
[59:46] confusion or fear cuz Faith has come
[59:49] unto thee we're no longer living under
[59:51] bondage because faith has come don't you
[59:54] you realize this whole world but the mar
[59:56] they're living in a state of bondage
[59:58] they're bound they're Bound by fear
[59:59] they're Bound By by Spirits they're
[1:00:01] Bound by addictions they're they're so
[1:00:03] bound up but the Bible says that God has
[1:00:06] not given us the spirit of fear he G us
[1:00:08] the spir of power and of love and of a
[1:00:11] sound mind therefore as Believers we're
[1:00:13] not living in a state of fear brother
[1:00:15] West we ain't going around looking and
[1:00:17] wondering what's going to happen to us
[1:00:18] tomorrow and I hope that God is able to
[1:00:20] bring us out and my goodness I hope God
[1:00:23] can get a hold of the government and I
[1:00:24] hope God can give us a good president
[1:00:26] that we can make it through to another
[1:00:27] day we don't live like that because
[1:00:29] we're Believers we're not living in a
[1:00:31] state of fear we're living in a state of

[1:02:03] that he had it had fell apart his barns
[1:02:05] had burned down his Fields had been
[1:02:07] burned he lost his crops he lost his
[1:02:08] livestock he lost his children he and
[1:02:11] then the people had come by and they be
[1:02:12] to ridicule him and make fun of him
[1:02:14] because he was still standing there his
[1:02:15] own wife she said why don't you just
[1:02:17] Curse God and die he said you speak like
[1:02:19] a foolish woman his friends come by and
[1:02:21] see you must have done something wrong
[1:02:23] job but look at the condition that
[1:02:25] you're in but you realize that it wasn't
[1:02:26] nothing that he done wrong but said he
[1:02:28] was the best man of his day and God
[1:02:30] chose him to be tested and tried
[1:02:32] whenever Satan would come by he said
[1:02:34] I'll make him curse you to your face and
[1:02:36] he done everything he could but he
[1:02:38] couldn't make him Curse God that's right
[1:02:40] why because he rested in the promise of
[1:02:42] God he said he was rested in elohim's
[1:02:44] promise he said after the skin works the
[1:02:47] or though the skin worms destroy this
[1:02:49] body yet in my flesh shall I see God he
[1:02:52] was resting in eloh him it didn't matter
[1:02:55] what comes brother Mark I'm resting in
[1:02:57] the promise of Elohim he said see he
[1:02:59] rested in it it didn't matter what come
[1:03:01] his way and one day he saw the
[1:03:03] Fulfillment of it you remember in
[1:03:05] Matthew the 27th chapter whenever the
[1:03:07] Saints resurrected and they went into
[1:03:08] the city he said in my flesh I'll see
[1:03:11] God out of the Grave he came and saw and
[1:03:14] fulfilled the very thing that he was
[1:03:15] resting in my what a glorious promise
[1:03:18] isn't that wonderful that the re the
[1:03:20] resurrection of the saints of God his
[1:03:22] wife said Curse God and but he rested in
[1:03:25] the promise of Elohim you know why
[1:03:26] brother Mark because job had a
[1:03:28] revelation that those other men didn't
[1:03:30] have he had a revelation that life with
[1:03:32] God was better than life without God
[1:03:35] that'll preach right there yes sir he
[1:03:36] had a revelation it didn't matter what
[1:03:38] had gone on in his life but he knew life
[1:03:40] with God was better than life without
[1:03:42] God I wonder how many say that today
[1:03:44] here a man that had balls on his skin he
[1:03:46] was sitting on an ash Heap everything
[1:03:48] around him had fell down he had never
[1:03:50] done nothing to God it wasn't because of
[1:03:52] his failures here was a man that had
[1:03:53] made sacrif like he was supposed to but
[1:03:56] after everything failed he still knew
[1:03:58] that life with God was better than life
[1:04:00] without God right and he rested in his
[1:04:02] promise how many say that today life
[1:04:04] with God is better than life without God
[1:04:07] he went to his grave brother Mark
[1:04:08] resting on that same promise he and he
[1:04:10] became one of the most blessed men That
[1:04:12] Ever Walked he received a double portion
[1:04:14] of everything that he had lost isn't it
[1:04:16] something because life with God I'm I'm
[1:04:18] I'm just going to preach on it a minute
[1:04:19] cuz life with God is better than life
[1:04:21] without God let me just tell you
[1:04:23] something that'll help you this morning
[1:04:24] life with God is better than life
[1:04:26] without God if you don't believe me go
[1:04:27] ask Samson what it was like when he
[1:04:29] didn't have God when he when he put God
[1:04:31] aside and and he wound up laying his
[1:04:33] head in the lap of the Lila and he lost
[1:04:35] his strength and he lost his eyesight
[1:04:37] and he was put up and publicly
[1:04:39] humiliated life with God is better than
[1:04:41] life without God see whenever God came
[1:04:43] and he went out he said Lord restore
[1:04:45] unto me my faith and that God gave him
[1:04:47] his strength back and he took 30,000 of
[1:04:49] the Philistines with him why because
[1:04:51] life with God is better than life
[1:04:53] without God if you don't believe me ask
[1:04:55] Gideon what it was like when he was
[1:04:57] hiding behind a wine press and he was a
[1:04:59] coward and he would hide from his duty
[1:05:01] because that's what it's like when you
[1:05:02] don't have God but when the angel of the
[1:05:04] Lord came by his way he gave him the
[1:05:07] strength to be the judge over all of
[1:05:09] Israel because life with God is better
[1:05:11] than life without God go ask Apostle
[1:05:14] Paul he was a murderer an out killing
[1:05:16] Christian but whenever he met the angel
[1:05:17] of the Lord when he met him on the road
[1:05:19] he said it is I the Lord Jesus brother
[1:05:22] Mark it changed his whole commission he
[1:05:24] became the very Prophet to the gentile
[1:05:26] people because life with God is better
[1:05:29] than life without God life with god
[1:05:31] brother Mar it don't matter what the old
[1:05:33] life is it may be filled let me tell you
[1:05:35] what it is I don't I don't have to guess
[1:05:36] I know what it is it's death it's sorrow
[1:05:39] it's addiction it's drug addiction it's
[1:05:41] alcohol addiction it's divorce it's
[1:05:44] family problem it's family trouble it's
[1:05:47] chaos it's Darkness it's it's adultery
[1:05:50] it's all the filth of the things of the
[1:05:51] world it's life without God but life
[1:05:53] with God will bring peace to your family
[1:05:56] life with God it'll bring peace to your
[1:05:58] home it'll bring peace to your life
[1:05:59] it'll take the habits that you have and
[1:06:01] it'll put them aside and deliver you
[1:06:03] from the things of sin life with God is
[1:06:06] better than life without God you can't
[1:06:09] do it without God let me just make it
[1:06:10] simple for you you can't do it without
[1:06:12] God that's the problem with the world
[1:06:14] today everybody wants to go to church
[1:06:16] without God they want to be Christians
[1:06:18] without God they they don't want that
[1:06:20] real life of Holiness living on the
[1:06:21] inside they just they just want the
[1:06:23] status of saying I'm I go to church and
[1:06:25] I do my duty and I pay my tithe and my
[1:06:27] offerings and I show up on time but they
[1:06:29] don't want to do it with God let me tell
[1:06:32] you life with God is better than life
[1:06:34] without God you know Mark TW once said
[1:06:37] he said see I quit he said quitting
[1:06:39] smoking is easy I know CU I've done it a
[1:06:41] thousand times is't that the truth said
[1:06:45] I've done it a thousand see life with
[1:06:47] God is better than life without God it's
[1:06:50] hard to do it without God but with God
[1:06:53] it's it's different
[1:06:54] with God you say why why is it different
[1:06:56] with God let me tell you this one time
[1:06:58] with God it takes the very desire away
[1:07:00] can I read this in the
[1:07:01] scripture James says it like this he
[1:07:04] said let no man say when he is tempted I
[1:07:06] am tempted of God for God don't can't be
[1:07:08] tempted with evil neither does he tempt
[1:07:10] any man but every man is tempted when he
[1:07:12] is drawn away of his own lust and
[1:07:15] enticed now that word lust it come from
[1:07:17] the Greek word epithumia which means
[1:07:20] desire every man that sins or is tempted
[1:07:23] he's drawn away by his own desire said
[1:07:26] see So then whenever this desire has
[1:07:29] conceived it brings forth sin and sin
[1:07:32] when it is finished it'll bring forth
[1:07:34] death but see that ain't the end of the
[1:07:36] story see because Temptation comes to us
[1:07:39] all you can't you can't help but
[1:07:41] Temptation we're all tempted and tried
[1:07:43] but listen what the Bible says he said
[1:07:44] but blessed is the man that endureth
[1:07:46] Temptation somebody say amen amen for
[1:07:49] when he is tried he shall receive the
[1:07:51] Crown of Life which the Lord has
[1:07:53] promised promised to them that love him
[1:07:56] is't that something that hear that God
[1:07:57] would blessed is the man that endureth
[1:07:59] Temptation you say well brother man how
[1:08:00] do I Endure Temptation let me tell you
[1:08:02] how you'll do it with God you'll never
[1:08:04] endure it without God you'll have to do
[1:08:06] it with God the only way to overcome sin
[1:08:08] is with God the only way to overcome
[1:08:10] addiction is with God the only way to
[1:08:12] have a True Deliverance is with God but
[1:08:15] the Bible says With God all things are
[1:08:17] possible with god brother Mark think
[1:08:19] about it with God the very things that
[1:08:21] you use as a crutch become your
[1:08:24] testimony that's the difference with God
[1:08:27] isn't it something that you get around
[1:08:28] get around people well brother Matt I
[1:08:30] you know you you you find people they'll
[1:08:32] get arrested and they'll getting some I
[1:08:33] just feel like preaching this morning
[1:08:34] y'all thank you for the Liberty but but
[1:08:36] when they they'll get arrested or
[1:08:37] something well man what' you do what
[1:08:38] happened well man I got I got out there
[1:08:40] drinking I got drunk a little bit I
[1:08:42] didn't even know what I was doing when I
[1:08:43] done it see it's the
[1:08:44] crutch why why why was you slapping
[1:08:47] around on your wife well I didn't know
[1:08:48] what I was doing it was the alcohol
[1:08:49] doing it wasn't me it was just that
[1:08:51] alcohol or the drugs or the pills that I
[1:08:52] was taking see it's it's a
[1:08:54] crutch it's always a crutch why are you
[1:08:57] in this shape well it's this addiction
[1:08:58] why are you in this shape well it was my
[1:09:00] daddy and it was the way I was raised
[1:09:02] and you know it his father before him is
[1:09:03] a way I was whatever people can use for

[1:09:24] Lord I don't want to have life without
[1:09:25] God I want to have life with you just to

[1:09:30] was a man one time down at the at the
[1:09:32] Robinson Memorial Coliseum how many
[1:09:34] remember this testimony he went down
[1:09:35] there to a meeting and he came out there
[1:09:37] on crutches he was a crippled man he
[1:09:39] sold pencils down on the steps down
[1:09:40] there in little Ro and he would sell
[1:09:42] pencils to to make a little extra money
[1:09:44] he was a beggar he went into one of
[1:09:45] brother Brown's meetings he came up in
[1:09:46] the prayer line and that crippled man
[1:09:48] when he came up there they they he
[1:09:50] prayed for him and he went out and he
[1:09:51] healed him that next day next time they
[1:09:53] come back they were still in the same
[1:09:55] meeting that man they had been hopping
[1:09:56] around for all those years on crutches

[1:10:00] was being a beggar and he was begging
[1:10:01] for pencils when they went by the next
[1:10:03] day he said that man had the crutch in
[1:10:05] his hand and he had a sign on the top of
[1:10:07] it he said these old babies used to

[1:10:18] very thing that used to hold me down the
[1:10:20] very thing that used to make me a beggar
[1:10:22] the thing that caused me to go through

[1:11:25] becomes your testimony somebody say it
[1:11:27] with me life with God is better than
[1:11:29] life without God you say well brother
[1:11:31] man how do you include god well here's
[1:11:33] the answer you include the word of God
[1:11:35] in your
[1:11:36] life how do you include him your
[1:11:39] prayer it stops becoming a speech and it
[1:11:43] becomes
[1:11:44] real it becomes conversation it's called
[1:11:47] communion Fellowship it's not just words
[1:11:51] it ain't just something that you repeat
[1:11:53] if you want God in your life how do you
[1:11:55] include God you seek guidance of God
[1:11:59] everything that you do you you you you
[1:12:01] you you you you ask God to guide you you
[1:12:04] follow the way that God would want you
[1:12:05] to go remember when David he brought the
[1:12:07] ark back into Israel it was a good thing
[1:12:09] how he knows that it was a good thing
[1:12:10] that was on his heart to bring it back
[1:12:12] to Israel but the prophet said but what
[1:12:14] he did is he just didn't do it the right
[1:12:16] way because the Bible the order of the
[1:12:18] scripture was that the ark was to be
[1:12:19] carried upon the shoulders of the
[1:12:21] Levites but but he came out and they put
[1:12:24] the Ark on a new car and they went back
[1:12:26] and you realize what it caused it caused
[1:12:27] death to come into the camp and here a
[1:12:30] man there was a sincere man he lost his
[1:12:32] life trying to keep it from hitting the
[1:12:33] ground when the C hit a bumpy Rock and
[1:12:35] went to turn over and here that man in
[1:12:37] his own sincerity but he lost his life
[1:12:39] because it wasn't done the way that God
[1:12:40] said to do it say see so so so we want
[1:12:43] to we want to do this and follow the
[1:12:45] ways of God brother says see so don't
[1:12:47] matter what you do in this life there
[1:12:48] are five musts how many want to hear
[1:12:50] them when you want to do something for
[1:12:51] the Lord there are five must these
[1:12:53] things must happen he said here's your
[1:12:54] five musts it's got to be this way first
[1:12:57] whatever you do it must be in God's time
[1:12:59] or in God's
[1:13:00] season so it couldn't be out of season
[1:13:02] second it had to be according to God's
[1:13:04] word friend this is good because if
[1:13:06] somebody gives you advice or Direction
[1:13:08] and it didn't Accord with to the word
[1:13:10] well then you know it didn't come from
[1:13:11] the Lord so you can always take it back
[1:13:13] to the word and see if it come from the
[1:13:15] Lord or not he says see and then the
[1:13:16] third thing is it must be through the
[1:13:18] man that God chose right God chooses you
[1:13:21] to do so he may have me do something he
[1:13:23] don't have you do God God didn't make
[1:13:25] everybody Pastor he didn't make
[1:13:26] everybody evangelist he did he didn't
[1:13:28] make everybody Apostle he did he didn't
[1:13:30] make he see he uses us for different
[1:13:32] purpose the diversity of gifts Paul
[1:13:34] called it you see it must be the man
[1:13:36] that God chose but if God is going to do
[1:13:38] something listen friends think about the
[1:13:40] age that we're in if God is going to do
[1:13:41] something these are the must he said see
[1:13:43] then it must come to the prophet first
[1:13:45] that's Amos 3:7 if you want to read it
[1:13:46] the Bible says surely the Lord God will
[1:13:48] do nothing unless he first would would
[1:13:49] reveal it to his servants the prophets
[1:13:52] so if it's going to be if if it's God
[1:13:53] going to do it it'll be first revealed
[1:13:55] to his servants the prophets and then
[1:13:57] the fifth thing is the prophet must be
[1:13:59] Vindicated by the word so it couldn't be
[1:14:01] there's many prophets that have raed
[1:14:03] that have raised up and said well I got
[1:14:04] a word from the Lord but the prophet
[1:14:06] wasn't Vindicated by the word it wasn't
[1:14:07] wasn't Vindicated by God so even though
[1:14:09] they may had a word from the Lord but
[1:14:11] the mar but it end up bringing failure
[1:14:13] see that's what's happened today he says
[1:14:15] it don't matter see people are really
[1:14:16] sincere but it doesn't matter how
[1:14:17] sincere you are when you try to do a god
[1:14:19] a service outside of the way that God
[1:14:21] provided his way it then then then we
[1:14:24] always mess it up even even if we're
[1:14:26] sincere we'll still mess it up remember
[1:14:28] when balum went down and remember God
[1:14:29] told bam don't go into the city but then
[1:14:31] then all the men talked him into it and
[1:14:33] he so he went but it wasn't because God
[1:14:35] sent him it was because they talked him
[1:14:37] into it he said see notice and whenever
[1:14:39] he went because the men talked him into
[1:14:41] it he done it contrary to what God Said
[1:14:44] and it became a curse instead of being a
[1:14:46] Revival isn't that something to go out
[1:14:48] and do something for the Lord and it be
[1:14:50] a curse instead of a Revival see that's
[1:14:52] why we do that's why we want to take
[1:14:54] things back to the word and that's why
[1:14:55] we want to we want to do everything
[1:14:57] according to the word of God but you
[1:14:58] notice what David done brother Mark he
[1:15:00] never consulted the word and it caused
[1:15:02] death to come to this man that was
[1:15:04] sincere and but said see now watch what
[1:15:06] happened he said there he said there
[1:15:08] everything was right their emotion their
[1:15:10] religious emotion it was great their
[1:15:12] intentions were great their Crusade was
[1:15:13] great their singing was great their
[1:15:15] dancing was great their shouting was
[1:15:16] great the music was great for they had
[1:15:18] the ark with them but what good is an
[1:15:21] ark without God
[1:15:24] right think about it he said what good
[1:15:25] is an ark without God it ain't nothing
[1:15:28] but a box filled with two tablets of
[1:15:30] stone what good is it without God what
[1:15:34] good it's a wooden box with with tables
[1:15:36] of stone he said that's the way it is
[1:15:37] whenever we come before the Lord today
[1:15:39] we want to do a service for the Lord I
[1:15:41] know we're having a communion service
[1:15:42] tonight he said that's like taking
[1:15:44] communion and being baptized what good
[1:15:46] does it do to be baptized if you hadn't
[1:15:48] first repented what good does it do to
[1:15:50] take communion and become a hypocrite if
[1:15:52] you don't live the laugh and believe the
[1:15:54] rest of God's word but take part of it
[1:15:56] and not rest of it it shows that there's
[1:15:58] something wrong but brother Mark but we
[1:16:00] come to take it you know me tell you why
[1:16:01] we take it because we believe the word
[1:16:03] of God right and and God has ordained it
[1:16:06] for this time and we and we live the
[1:16:08] life of a Christian can I just take a
[1:16:09] minute here I wasn't going to preach a
[1:16:11] service on communion but you realize the
[1:16:12] Bible tells us there's two reasons why a
[1:16:14] person should not partake in communion
[1:16:16] how many how many knows what they are
[1:16:17] there's two scriptural reasons to not
[1:16:20] take part of communion one was that a
[1:16:22] person was unrepentant and the other was
[1:16:25] that that they weren't born again so a
[1:16:27] man that wasn't born again he was a
[1:16:29] unregenerated or how the every you say
[1:16:31] that word but but but he but he wasn't
[1:16:33] born again and never gave his life to
[1:16:34] the Lord and the other was that he had
[1:16:35] unconfessed sin and he was unrepented
[1:16:37] that's the only two things that would
[1:16:39] stop you from taking communion so we
[1:16:41] come as Believers brother Mark we we we
[1:16:44] repent we're baptized we we we live the
[1:16:46] the word of God with all of our heart
[1:16:48] and and that don't mean you don't make
[1:16:49] mistakes every one of us do raise your
[1:16:51] hand if you don't make mistakes I didn't
[1:16:52] see a lot of hand hands go up so we're
[1:16:54] all in the same we're all in the same
[1:16:55] crowd we all make mistakes we all fail
[1:16:57] we all live in the same flesh you almost
[1:16:59] raised your hand some of you I don't I
[1:17:02] don't trick people and i s i I would
[1:17:04] have quickly corrected it but we all
[1:17:06] make mistakes so that that's not it but
[1:17:09] it's unconfessed sin something that
[1:17:11] that's in our life that's been built up
[1:17:12] that we're hiding but but confess it and
[1:17:14] make it right before the Lord don't
[1:17:15] don't miss out on communion because
[1:17:16] there's something in your life just make
[1:17:17] it right with the Lord it ain't
[1:17:19] something you got to go put on Facebook
[1:17:20] and tell everybody everything you ever
[1:17:21] done we ain't Catholics you ain't you
[1:17:23] ain't got to come to the priest and pour
[1:17:24] out everything to the priest and tell
[1:17:25] them every but but you can go to the
[1:17:27] high priest and you can pour everything
[1:17:28] out to him and say Here's Where I here's
[1:17:30] what I've had in my life and Lord I
[1:17:32] asked you to take it from me and just
[1:17:33] believe the whole word amen and come and
[1:17:36] and be a part of the service the Bible
[1:17:38] says we do that we do that in in
[1:17:40] remembrance of the Lord Jesus Remember
[1:17:42] when he came that was the The Last
[1:17:44] Supper that he had that's whenever Jesus
[1:17:46] had given this order here he was about
[1:17:47] to be taken and be crucified and hung on
[1:17:49] calvary's Cross but he came to the last
[1:17:51] supper and he and he broke the the bread
[1:17:53] with the disciples and took the wine he
[1:17:55] said do this in remembrance of me in
[1:17:57] other words brother Mark it was a it's a
[1:17:59] time of remembering the this supper this
[1:18:01] communion brother Wesley it's Tak it's
[1:18:04] the Lord's table it's taken part when
[1:18:06] you it's not just something that we go
[1:18:07] through as a ritual or tradition that
[1:18:09] that's what that's that's what that's
[1:18:11] what men have made it but let me ask you
[1:18:12] this what good is it if God isn't in it
[1:18:15] the whole church world does communion
[1:18:17] you realize that's one of the only
[1:18:18] things that that that every denomination
[1:18:20] does that they take communion in some
[1:18:22] way that it didn't matter what what what
[1:18:25] part of Christianity they were they take
[1:18:26] communion in some way but what good is
[1:18:29] it if God isn't in it see there's
[1:18:31] there's a right way brother Mark it was
[1:18:33] that we would that we would be that we
[1:18:35] would be right with God and and we would
[1:18:36] come and You' take the the bread and the
[1:18:38] wine it was a type of the body of Christ
[1:18:40] in the blood of Jesus he said I'm going
[1:18:42] to the cross and they're going to
[1:18:44] they're going to take my life he said
[1:18:45] but you just do this and remember it's
[1:18:47] whenever you come to the Lord's table
[1:18:49] and you sit down and and and you begin
[1:18:50] to feed on the bread it's as if you were
[1:18:52] sitting there with the Lord Jesus that
[1:18:54] day and he was breaking bread before his
[1:18:56] disciples saying remember what I've done
[1:18:58] for you come and have fellowship with me
[1:19:00] come and have communion with me and come
[1:19:01] and gather around the Lord's table and
[1:19:03] let's have Fellowship together and and
[1:19:06] to remember the things that God has done
[1:19:08] for us it isn't just a ritual or
[1:19:09] something that we're doing but let me
[1:19:11] tell you brother marrow if God isn't in
[1:19:12] it it ain't nothing but stale bread and
[1:19:14] fermented grapes it ain't there ain't
[1:19:16] nothing to it at all but because God is
[1:19:18] in it it ain't no different than you
[1:19:20] were sitting there that day and God was
[1:19:23] breaking bread before you isn't this
[1:19:25] something in the sincerity you realize
[1:19:27] what it is is the the all through the
[1:19:30] scripture can I just take a minute here
[1:19:32] we're about to have communion all
[1:19:33] through the scripture these fathers
[1:19:34] would go down and make sacrifices for
[1:19:36] their children and and when it started
[1:19:38] they were sincere and they laid their
[1:19:40] hands on the sacrifices and they watched
[1:19:41] the blood leave out of these animals and
[1:19:43] and they made this sacrifice for their
[1:19:45] own salvation for their sins but after a
[1:19:47] while that sacrifice became just a
[1:19:50] tradition and when Jesus came he would
[1:19:52] tell them it's it's just a tradition
[1:19:53] that you made but there had to be a real
[1:19:55] sacrifice that would come you realize
[1:19:57] that's the same thing it is that's
[1:19:58] taking communion but Mark when you take
[1:20:00] a hold of that bread he said this is my
[1:20:02] body that ain't no different than the
[1:20:03] real sincerity of those fathers that day
[1:20:05] when they would lay that sacrifice down
[1:20:07] and they would feel the blood leave the
[1:20:09] body why it was a sincere act to be able
[1:20:11] to go before God and have forgiveness
[1:20:14] for their sins and see how God stood on
[1:20:16] their behalf that's what it is to me to
[1:20:17] be able to take communion is to put your
[1:20:19] hands on the sacrifice that God has made
[1:20:22] for you
[1:20:23] and remember all that he has done he
[1:20:25] said for this one sacrifice once and for
[1:20:27] all it's the body of the Lord Jesus he
[1:20:29] said do this and remembrance of me isn't
[1:20:32] what the Bible says I know I got off my
[1:20:34] message a little bit Bible says we are
[1:20:37] to acknowledge God in all our ways you
[1:20:40] know what that means that means in every
[1:20:41] action brother Joe the decisions that we
[1:20:44] make and the things that we do that we
[1:20:45] need to make God the center of it God
[1:20:49] must he must hold the place of the
[1:20:51] highest importance in our life
[1:20:53] you said well brother man I don't I
[1:20:54] don't know if I can include God I don't
[1:20:56] I beg the
[1:20:57] differ I don't know if I can include God
[1:20:59] let me tell you why I know you can
[1:21:01] include god brother West did because God
[1:21:03] included you right that's why you can
[1:21:06] include him because he included you this
[1:21:09] is the same God brother Mark that chose
[1:21:11] Ruth when she lived in another land and
[1:21:14] he ordained her life all the way to the
[1:21:16] field of Bo West where she where where
[1:21:18] where where the very
[1:21:20] genealogy of Joseph would come from the
[1:21:23] the where we see Jesus's name in the
[1:21:25] Bible you see you see it was all
[1:21:27] ordained of God this is the same God
[1:21:29] that that had ordained job to be able to
[1:21:32] to be able to to be able to stand
[1:21:33] whenever he told Satan you'll never be
[1:21:35] able to cause him to curse me why
[1:21:36] because God knew Job he knew the very
[1:21:38] things job would do he knew Job would
[1:21:40] never fail he knew Job wouldn't be able
[1:21:42] to curse God in that way is the same God
[1:21:45] that knew Jeremiah that told him I knew
[1:21:47] you before I knitted you together in
[1:21:49] your mother's womb God included you
[1:21:52] before your ever born don't you realize
[1:21:53] friends that same God that chose them is
[1:21:55] the same God that chose you he's the
[1:21:57] same God that knew them he's the same
[1:21:59] God that knew you the same God that
[1:22:01] formed Jeremiah he's the same God that
[1:22:03] formed you and the Bible says he called
[1:22:05] you and he elected you and you see what
[1:22:07] it was he said it was the very God you
[1:22:09] say what was it he turned my life around
[1:22:11] didn't me tell you where people mess up
[1:22:13] is they say well my life turned around
[1:22:15] because I decided I wanted to do better
[1:22:17] no friend that ain't it I made a
[1:22:19] decision I'm going my life's going to be
[1:22:21] better and I'm going to start serving
[1:22:22] the Lord no that ain't it well I was
[1:22:24] sitting around the house and I got to
[1:22:25] thinking wouldn't it be better if I was
[1:22:27] a Christian no that ain't it it had
[1:22:29] nothing to do with your own thoughts he
[1:22:30] had everything to do with God it was God
[1:22:32] that knew you it was God that formed you
[1:22:34] it was God that called you Paul said it
[1:22:36] was God that elected you before the
[1:22:38] foundation of the
[1:22:40] world brother R said he said it was what
[1:22:43] God did what God called you had no will
[1:22:46] to call Glory to God he said you could
[1:22:48] have no desire to call because your
[1:22:50] nature was completely contrary to it but
[1:22:53] God by election he called you and he
[1:22:55] turned you around and he set your
[1:22:57] affections towards Christ and the things
[1:22:59] above he said how could we turn that
[1:23:02] down cuz God is the one that called you
[1:23:04] God that's one that that set your heart
[1:23:06] it's God that established you it's God
[1:23:08] that brought you here it's not an
[1:23:10] accident that you're sitting in this
[1:23:11] church this morning it's God that
[1:23:12] brought you here I know people say well
[1:23:14] you messed up here and you went the
[1:23:16] wrong way here and you went the wrong
[1:23:17] direction but it's God that is in
[1:23:19] control of our life it's God's purpose
[1:23:21] that bring you back to the message of
[1:23:23] the hour that he could feed you he could
[1:23:25] satisfy you he'd be your satisfying
[1:23:28] portion he said God by election called
[1:23:30] you it was God that turned you around
[1:23:32] listen this is what Paul preached how
[1:23:34] many knows that to be the truth that was
[1:23:35] Paul's message he said he preached the
[1:23:38] lecture he said according to election
[1:23:39] might stand you realize when Paul
[1:23:40] preached this message I got a few
[1:23:42] minutes to close when Paul y'all just
[1:23:44] get with me just a few minutes when Paul
[1:23:46] went to preach this message butar it was
[1:23:48] in the days of Jesus in the time or they
[1:23:50] had just came through whenever the
[1:23:52] phares would talk about how they were
[1:23:54] born of Abraham's seed and they'd carry
[1:23:56] that on there they'd carry that out and
[1:23:57] let everybody know I can track my
[1:23:58] lineage all the way back to Abraham I
[1:24:01] know who my daddy and his daddy and they
[1:24:02] had all this seed line everything
[1:24:04] figured out to where they they felt like
[1:24:05] they were special people this is
[1:24:07] whenever Paul would come and speak these
[1:24:09] words you know why brother Mar because
[1:24:10] they were the chosen of God because they
[1:24:12] were the natural Seed of Abraham no
[1:24:14] wonder they hated Paul Paul said but
[1:24:17] they that are not all Israel which are
[1:24:19] of Israel he said not because they're of
[1:24:21] the Seed of Abraham are they children
[1:24:23] but in Isaac shall thy seed be called
[1:24:25] notice why he's saying this because
[1:24:28] Abraham had more children than Isaac see
[1:24:30] see so just being a son of Abraham or of
[1:24:33] the lineage of Abraham it would never do
[1:24:35] anything why would it be different if
[1:24:36] you come through ishmail or if you came
[1:24:38] through Isaac why would it matter the
[1:24:40] difference it still come from the seed
[1:24:41] line of Abraham so Paul says so that it
[1:24:44] can't be that he said for it was an
[1:24:46] Isaac only the seed of Isaac was the
[1:24:48] seed even called in the natural lineage
[1:24:50] he says Esau couldn't be the the natural
[1:24:52] image of Abraham he said see so it's not
[1:24:55] the children of the flesh these are not
[1:24:56] the children of God but the children of
[1:24:58] the promis are the one that are kind of
[1:25:00] for seed so here Paul took the very
[1:25:02] genealogy of Abraham I wish I had time
[1:25:04] to do it this morning but he took the
[1:25:06] very genealogy of Abraham and proed to
[1:25:08] them that that couldn't be the reason
[1:25:10] that made them children of God he said
[1:25:13] see so it wasn't of the flesh but it was
[1:25:14] of the seed or or the promise that you
[1:25:16] were kind of proceed for This Is The
[1:25:18] Word of Promise at this time will I come
[1:25:20] and Sarah shall have a son and not only
[1:25:22] this but when Becca had conceived by one
[1:25:24] Our Father Isaac he said he came to him
[1:25:26] according to election might stand out of
[1:25:27] works of him that calleth but he was
[1:25:29] said unto her the elders Shall Serve the
[1:25:30] younger Jacob have I loved Esau have I
[1:25:32] hated he said what shall we say then is
[1:25:34] there unrighteousness with God God
[1:25:36] forbid so then it is not of him that
[1:25:38] willth listen he said it is not of him
[1:25:41] that willth nor of him that runneth but
[1:25:43] it is of god that showeth mercy and then
[1:25:46] Paul would go on and preach this
[1:25:47] wonderful message brother Mark he would
[1:25:49] say he he said has the Potter not have
[1:25:52] power power over the clay how are we the
[1:25:54] vessel he but what vessel looks at the
[1:25:56] potter and says why have you made me
[1:25:58] this way what vessel looks at the potter
[1:26:01] and said you know what I don't want to
[1:26:02] be that kind of a pot I I want to be
[1:26:04] something that you drink out of I want
[1:26:05] to be a bowl that or whatever kind of
[1:26:07] pot but he said but the vessel can't say
[1:26:09] to the Potter why have you made me this
[1:26:12] for it's in the Potter's hands it's the
[1:26:14] Potter that made you he's the one that
[1:26:15] formed you he's the one that caused you
[1:26:17] to be born to the mother that you were
[1:26:19] born to friends it wasn't an accident
[1:26:20] that you were in this life an accident
[1:26:23] that you're here this morning but it was
[1:26:24] the Potter having power over the clay he
[1:26:27] said it was a Potter that done it he
[1:26:29] made one vessel of Honor another Of
[1:26:31] Dishonor that God think of it he said if
[1:26:33] God willing to show his wrath would make
[1:26:35] power and make his power known he
[1:26:37] endured with Longs suffering the vessels
[1:26:38] of Wrath that would fit it for
[1:26:41] Destruction how would God make a vessel
[1:26:43] of Wrath that were fitted to destruction
[1:26:45] think about the same way God would
[1:26:46] predestinate you what a paradox that is
[1:26:49] that you're a free moral agent but
[1:26:51] you're predestinated you're a free moral
[1:26:53] agian and you you can make all the the
[1:26:55] choices and you can make this decision
[1:26:56] like Ruth that Ruth had to make but
[1:26:58] still yet but but you're elected of God
[1:27:01] what a paradox that seems to be but
[1:27:03] think about when the Bible makes it
[1:27:04] plain he says but God predestinated by
[1:27:06] forn knowledge see God knew knew who you
[1:27:09] were God knew what you would do God he
[1:27:11] couldn't even be God if he wasn't
[1:27:12] Eternal if God if God didn't know this
[1:27:14] service would be here this morning
[1:27:15] friends don't you realize it may catch
[1:27:17] men off guard but it don't catch God off
[1:27:19] guard he knew where we'd be this morning
[1:27:22] he knew who wouldd be sitting here he
[1:27:23] knew we'd be having communion he knew
[1:27:25] the people that'd be baptized today it
[1:27:26] didn't catch God off guard he said see
[1:27:29] God had made it this way he said he
[1:27:31] would see brother Mark he he would he
[1:27:33] would make a a vessel that way because
[1:27:35] God knew what they would be he would
[1:27:37] make a vessel of Wrath that would be
[1:27:39] fitted to destruction that he might make
[1:27:41] known The Riches of his glory on the
[1:27:44] vessels of Mercy which he have prepared
[1:27:47] unto Glory isn't it something that God
[1:27:50] would make you brother Mark that he
[1:27:52] could make known The Riches of his glory
[1:27:54] the reward he would make known The
[1:27:57] Riches of his glory unto the vessels of
[1:27:59] Mercy that's what I see when I look
[1:28:01] across this building this morning
[1:28:03] vessels of
[1:28:05] Mercy we all have failures but we're
[1:28:07] vessels of Mercy you know sometimes you
[1:28:10] could take a you could take a glass you
[1:28:12] go down to a flea market you buy a glass
[1:28:14] or something down there brother Mark
[1:28:15] there ain't no tell them what people's
[1:28:16] drank out of it you don't know you can
[1:28:19] look all back and you know I know
[1:28:20] everybody likes them old Fire King cup
[1:28:22] some of the the brothers them old old
[1:28:23] old timey ones or whatever but but but
[1:28:26] way they carry and all that some but but
[1:28:28] you know there ain't no telling what
[1:28:29] people could have been an old man had
[1:28:31] that down there and drank whiskey out of
[1:28:32] it every morning you don't have no idea
[1:28:34] what they put in it but whenever you got
[1:28:36] it you took it and you washed it you
[1:28:38] Sanctified it you know how you
[1:28:40] Sanctified you get get that old don't do
[1:28:43] that no more but you put it in the
[1:28:44] dishwasher and you push
[1:28:46] on brother Mark and that hot water comes
[1:28:48] around and them little Tide Pods they
[1:28:51] got to start doing is that what you use
[1:28:52] no the Pod some kind of pod and that pod
[1:28:55] starts doing its work and bleaches out
[1:28:57] the cup it sanctifies it that you could
[1:29:00] put in something that is satisfying to
[1:29:02] you see when God makes the vessel it's a
[1:29:05] vessel of Mercy you he uses it even
[1:29:08] though it may had some junk in it at one
[1:29:10] time but God made it for another purpose
[1:29:13] it may may we put put all kinds of stuff
[1:29:15] in it but God made it for another
[1:29:16] purpose we're vessels of Mercy amen look
[1:29:19] around this morning that's what you're
[1:29:21] looking at vess
[1:29:22] of Mercy let me tell you what the Bible
[1:29:24] says and I'm going to hurry and close
[1:29:26] Bible says God is a merciful god says so
[1:29:30] therefore be merciful as your father in
[1:29:32] Heaven is merciful isn't that the nature
[1:29:34] of a Believer right you know why we give
[1:29:36] Mercy brother Mar because Mercy produces
[1:29:39] Mercy he says judge not that you be not
[1:29:41] judged condemn not that you be not
[1:29:42] condemned forgive and you shall be
[1:29:44] forgiven give and it shall be given unto
[1:29:46] you but listen how it was given in good
[1:29:48] measure pressed down shaken together
[1:29:49] running over shall men give to your
[1:29:51] bosom you ever thought about that what
[1:29:52] the Bible said good measure press down
[1:29:55] shaking together running over you take a
[1:29:57] basket and he said this is how God will
[1:29:59] give you you take a basket it wasn't
[1:30:00] just Loosely pulling pouring in some
[1:30:02] seeds in there said but it'd be poured
[1:30:04] in there and it would be shaken and
[1:30:06] pressed down and press down to where
[1:30:09] every part of it would be filled brother
[1:30:10] Mark and still yet it'd be running over
[1:30:13] in other words when God would give you
[1:30:15] he'd give you till there wasn't no more
[1:30:16] there wasn't one empty space there
[1:30:18] wasn't there was one place in there but
[1:30:20] the mark that wasn't filled but God he
[1:30:22] said it's shaken and it's pressed down
[1:30:24] and and it's good measure and it's
[1:30:26] overflowing this is what God wants to
[1:30:28] give unto you is that something that's
[1:30:30] how God says that you'll receive I don't
[1:30:32] know about you but that makes me that
[1:30:33] makes me want to do something for the
[1:30:34] Lord he says see for what you give out
[1:30:37] the same measure that you meet or the
[1:30:38] same measure that you give out is what
[1:30:40] will be measured unto you again that
[1:30:42] that's a scripture to live by in other
[1:30:44] words if you give Mercy you you want to
[1:30:46] give Mercy like you want to receive
[1:30:47] Mercy you want to give judgment like you
[1:30:49] want to receive judgment you want to
[1:30:51] give Grace like you want to receive
[1:30:52] Grace you want to give offering like you
[1:30:54] want to receive offering you give praise
[1:30:56] like you want to receive praise think
[1:30:58] about it how you give is how you receive
[1:31:01] that's a God that's a Godly principle
[1:31:03] The Go the principle of sewing and
[1:31:05] reaping you realize how many say that
[1:31:07] this morning a Godly principle it's a
[1:31:10] god some everybody say it Godly
[1:31:11] principle the so the law of swing and
[1:31:13] reaping the Bible says be not deceived
[1:31:15] God is Not mock whatever a man Seth he
[1:31:17] shall also reap if he swws to the flesh
[1:31:19] he'll reach corruption if he SWS to the
[1:31:21] spirit he'll reap everlasting life in
[1:31:23] other words brother Mark whatever is
[1:31:24] planted will be made manifest but I'm
[1:31:26] going to tell you something that ain't
[1:31:27] just for you but it goes for God too
[1:31:29] glory to God I feel like preaching we're
[1:31:31] we're we're ready to close but that goes
[1:31:33] for God too it's a law of sewing and
[1:31:34] reaping you know what that means that
[1:31:36] whatever God put in you then God has the
[1:31:38] ability to bring out if God put
[1:31:40] something in you then God ain't just
[1:31:41] done with it but he's going to bring it
[1:31:43] to pass let me tell you something about
[1:31:45] God God has a way to get it out of you
[1:31:47] it don't matter how long it's been there
[1:31:49] God has a way to get it out of you and
[1:31:51] there ain't no one thing the devil can
[1:31:53] do to stop it he'll send spirits to keep
[1:31:55] it down he'll send malice and anger and
[1:31:57] jealousy and everything that he can to
[1:31:59] keep you from coming to pass or to keep
[1:32:01] you from from coming to your full
[1:32:03] potential but let me tell you a secret
[1:32:05] the devil will never keep you from being
[1:32:07] a son or a daughter of God God has a way
[1:32:10] of getting out of you what God put in
[1:32:12] you don't you realize friends there's a
[1:32:13] place you can be with God that the devil
[1:32:15] can't touch brother said that's what the
[1:32:17] Bible says grieve not the holy spirit of
[1:32:19] God whereby you're sealed until the day
[1:32:21] of your red Redemption the devil can't
[1:32:23] even touch you he said you're sealed in
[1:32:25] there you're beneath the blood you can't
[1:32:27] go no more out because you're a part of
[1:32:29] God's family you're sealed by the Holy
[1:32:31] Spirit the Devil Couldn't get you even
[1:32:33] if he had to for you are dead your old
[1:32:36] husband is dead you're buried the life
[1:32:38] is hid in God through Jesus Christ and
[1:32:40] you're sealed by the Holy Ghost how is
[1:32:42] he going to get to
[1:32:44] you think about it that's where people
[1:32:47] are worried the devil's going to get me
[1:32:49] he's going to take me out of church he's
[1:32:50] going to destroy my family he's going to
[1:32:52] lead me into these things he said how is
[1:32:53] he going to get to you glory to God that
[1:32:55] ain't all of it and how are you going to
[1:32:57] get out I know they say that all the
[1:32:59] time but it ain't bu of nonsense well
[1:33:01] this person this person left the message
[1:33:03] ain't nobody ever left the message let
[1:33:05] me tell you friends that you can't leave
[1:33:06] something that you're not a part of if
[1:33:08] it ever if you're ever in it you ain't
[1:33:10] leaving out of it it's something on the
[1:33:11] inside of you it changes you and he said
[1:33:13] you're sealed in this message is the
[1:33:15] Seal of God it's the very life of Jesus
[1:33:17] Christ that comes into the heart a
[1:33:19] Believer and that turns you amen into
[1:33:22] what God has called you to be there's
[1:33:24] people all around it they'll go Every
[1:33:26] Which Way but that don't concern me the
[1:33:28] Bible says in the days of Paul there was
[1:33:29] Believers and there was unbelievers and
[1:33:31] he waited until all the unbelievers were
[1:33:33] gone and after the unbelievers were gone
[1:33:35] then the Holy Ghost fell on the rest of
[1:33:36] them that were there those that remain
[1:33:38] they receive the very seal of almighty
[1:33:40] God let me tell you it don't fase me cuz
[1:33:42] people want to go to it let them say
[1:33:44] what they want to say let them go where
[1:33:46] they want to go but I'm going to stand
[1:33:47] on the promise of Elohim that God has
[1:33:49] made in this hour there's a place that
[1:33:52] you can be that the devil can't touch
[1:33:54] you right God listen he can't touch you
[1:33:58] it don't matter matter what he does he
[1:33:59] can never touch you let me tell you what
[1:34:01] B said he said see you're sealed in by
[1:34:03] the Holy Ghost how's he going to get to
[1:34:04] you he said you can't get out and the
[1:34:07] devil can't get in right think about it
[1:34:09] you can't get out you hearing me you
[1:34:12] can't get out because you're sealed in
[1:34:15] and the devil can't get in he said why
[1:34:18] because you're a new creation not to a
[1:34:20] denomination but to the word word you're
[1:34:22] a creation of the word of God my a't
[1:34:26] that powerful somebody say that with me
[1:34:28] I'm a creation of the word your creation
[1:34:31] of the word of God said see this is
[1:34:33] God's word and he and he's made it for
[1:34:36] us I I don't have time to finish won't
[1:34:38] you stand your feet as a music players
[1:34:40] will come this morning you are creation
[1:34:43] of the word of God think about it you
[1:34:46] can't get out and the devil can't get in
[1:34:48] Praise the Lord a't that something that
[1:34:51] makes me me feel good this morning amen
[1:34:53] that God would elect a people but Mark
[1:34:56] let me let me tell you what's happen is
[1:34:58] why people are running so too and fro is
[1:35:00] because they never really got in yet
[1:35:02] right that don't mean that they can't I
[1:35:03] I believe if there if there's if there's
[1:35:05] breath in a body there's still hope I
[1:35:07] stand on that amen I I cry for Mercy for
[1:35:10] everybody I stand on that but if they
[1:35:13] ever get in if they ever get in this
[1:35:16] place that I'm preaching about this
[1:35:17] morning sir they can't get out right
[1:35:20] it's something locked in in it's a place
[1:35:23] isn't it something a resting place
[1:35:24] brother Mark that you can get with God
[1:35:26] you know what God does because of that
[1:35:28] seed that's on the inside of you they
[1:35:31] may have been buried there a long time
[1:35:32] but God has a way of bringing what's in
[1:35:35] you out isn't that something I wish I
[1:35:38] had time to preach it this
[1:35:39] morning you remember you remember that
[1:35:42] old story that the the auctioneer was
[1:35:45] going down and they had an Old Violin
[1:35:48] come up there they got up there and they
[1:35:50] here's an Old Violin in and people
[1:35:52] looked at and the auctioner went to
[1:35:53] auction off he said he anybody give a
[1:35:55] dollar dollar now two $2 doll now three
[1:35:58] they're going to auction it off and
[1:35:59] after a little bit this this old man
[1:36:01] that was sitting in the crowd he came up
[1:36:03] there and he picked the Old Violin up
[1:36:05] and brother Wesley looked it over and he
[1:36:07] got to wiping the dust off of it he get
[1:36:11] he went to pluck it on the string and
[1:36:12] held it up to his ear and turnning those
[1:36:14] little Keys tune it in just right took
[1:36:18] the old bow and took some arzin out of
[1:36:20] the case and put a little rosin on and
[1:36:23] torqu the string just right put that
[1:36:26] violin up to his cheek and held it and
[1:36:29] got the playing on it but Mark every
[1:36:31] chord that he struck it be to sing out
[1:36:33] through the auditorium see what what
[1:36:36] happened is that as it begin to sing out
[1:36:38] is the most beautiful song that you ever
[1:36:40] heard played it was the it was the best
[1:36:41] tune violin a handmade that was made by
[1:36:44] a master Craftsman and here as he begin
[1:36:47] to play it that auctioner picked the
[1:36:49] microphone back up he said who give give
[1:36:51] a th000 he said anybody got a th000 a
[1:36:54] th000 now two somebody give me a th000
[1:36:55] now two 2,000 now 3 3,000 3,000 and a
[1:36:58] four and a four and a th000 now five
[1:36:59] somebody give five we're on the wrong
[1:37:01] side of 10 somebody give more why
[1:37:03] because something happened that's right
[1:37:05] they heard what was in it see said what
[1:37:07] happened it was in the hands of the
[1:37:08] master and the master he was the one
[1:37:10] that built it and he knew how to get out
[1:37:12] of it what was in it so that's the way
[1:37:14] that God done with you is brother Mark
[1:37:17] he whenever he gets a hold of your life
[1:37:18] it may not be tuned up just right you
[1:37:20] may come to the church this morning you
[1:37:22] may be so Out Of Tune you may have some
[1:37:23] broken strings you may be have dust all
[1:37:26] over your life but when the master gets
[1:37:27] a hold of it and he starts to play he
[1:37:30] can get something out of you that you
[1:37:31] never thought would come out of you and
[1:37:33] all of a sudden you begin to speak a
[1:37:35] different way you sing a different way
[1:37:37] you praise God a different way why
[1:37:38] because he has a way the master knows
[1:37:40] how to get out of you he's the one that
[1:37:43] made you he created you he formed you in
[1:37:45] his own image and Brother David Paul he
[1:37:47] can take you and he can play a tune with
[1:37:49] your life that nobody ever dream dream
[1:37:51] they would ever hear and all of a sudden
[1:37:53] you become a person of
[1:37:55] value let me tell you why you don't feel
[1:37:57] that way this morning you don't feel
[1:37:59] like you're worth anything you know why
[1:38:01] because your life it's been it's been
[1:38:02] shattered you've been through a lot of
[1:38:03] stuff you feel unworthy it's the gospel
[1:38:07] truth I'm preaching to somebody you feel
[1:38:09] I'm worthy but let me tell you in the
[1:38:10] scripture you ain't the only person ever
[1:38:12] felt that way cuz that's the way Peter
[1:38:13] was whenever Jesus came to him and Peter
[1:38:16] called him you notice what Peter said he
[1:38:18] said get thee away from me Lord for I am
[1:38:20] a sin man he was unworthy when the angel
[1:38:24] of the Lord came to Isaiah that day
[1:38:26] remember he said the angel came down and
[1:38:28] he began to call Isaiah Isaiah said oh
[1:38:30] Lord he said I'm a man with unclean lips
[1:38:32] and I live amongst the people that are
[1:38:34] unclean but one of the Angels he went
[1:38:37] over and he took a coal of fire off of
[1:38:39] the off of The Altar and he came over
[1:38:42] and he touched his lips with that coal
[1:38:43] of fire and brother weson when he
[1:38:45] touched it he said he said your iniquity
[1:38:48] has been removed from thee by a't it
[1:38:50] something into the very when he touched
[1:38:52] him the Bible says it was a live coal it
[1:38:55] wasn't like a charcoal like we use but
[1:38:57] it was a stone a live Stone then there
[1:39:00] something he took that red hot stone and
[1:39:02] everywhere that it touched it
[1:39:04] cleanses let me tell you this that's
[1:39:06] what brother M say he said this is what
[1:39:07] Jesus was he said he was a Lively Stone
[1:39:11] he said he was the the stone that the
[1:39:12] builders rejected but he became the
[1:39:14] chief Corner Stone they disallowed him
[1:39:16] he's a precious stone but he's become a
[1:39:18] Lively Stone this morning and everything
[1:39:20] that he touches is
[1:39:22] healed think about it everyone that
[1:39:24] touches the stone is healed he's a
[1:39:27] Lively Stone brother Mark it don't
[1:39:28] matter what part of your life that you
[1:39:29] need help in if you'll if you'll let
[1:39:31] this Stone get a hold of it it'll it'll
[1:39:33] fix it every part of our life brother
[1:39:35] Mark you say I'm unclean so was Isaiah
[1:39:38] I'm unclean so was Peter you notice what
[1:39:41] happened after the co of fire touched
[1:39:42] his lips brother Wesley it changed his
[1:39:44] confession then when the Lord said I
[1:39:46] need somebody to go Isaiah jumped up he
[1:39:48] said oh Lord send me send me oh Lord
[1:39:52] amen a man that was unclean but he said
[1:39:54] send me God has a way to get out of
[1:39:57] you what he put in you let's just bow

[1:48:28] to close the service we're having our
[1:48:30] baptism this afternoon now I don't know
[1:48:32] what the the weather is doing out there
[1:48:34] we uh spoke with brother Ben um about
[1:48:37] using their baptism if if need be but
[1:48:40] we're going to try to go down to the
[1:48:42] river and and be baptized and those that
[1:48:45] that can and just the just the Lord the
[1:48:48] Lord willing and but we're going we're
[1:48:49] going to make make it happen one way or
[1:48:51] another and you know let me tell you
[1:48:53] something about baptism that that Philip
[1:48:56] and the unic when he went down that day
[1:48:58] they went down Brother David Paul and
[1:49:00] they passed by this old ditch on the
[1:49:01] side of the road and after testifying to
[1:49:04] him about Jesus Christ he said well
[1:49:05] here's water what prevents me didn't
[1:49:08] really matter what where the water was
[1:49:09] it didn't matter if you put it in a
[1:49:11] baptism pool or put it in a bathtub or
[1:49:12] put it in a river I know a lot of people
[1:49:14] think got to be in a certain place but
[1:49:15] it ain't like that at all wherever he
[1:49:18] said here's water and Philip got down he
[1:49:19] back baptizing What mattered is that he
[1:49:21] repented to God and his heart he was
[1:49:23] making his heart right with the Lord and
[1:49:25] then and then he then he went down and
[1:49:27] had baptism I maybe I just want to
[1:49:28] invite you as we close this morning
[1:49:30] those that are W to be baptized I know
[1:49:32] we we had a couple and the Lord just put
[1:49:34] it on my heart uh uh a few weeks ago
[1:49:37] when the couple had asked to be baptized
[1:49:39] and and brother Ben and his wife and and
[1:49:41] to be baptized in the name of the Lord
[1:49:43] Jesus Christ and and I just felt like
[1:49:45] there'd be more of them I don't know who
[1:49:46] was there with me but the Lord just
[1:49:48] pressed on my heart that that that
[1:49:49] wasn't the only ones and so I um I
[1:49:52] whoever I was there with I don't
[1:49:54] remember who it was but um but but the
[1:49:56] Lord just put it on my heart and I told
[1:49:57] him I I really believe there's more than
[1:49:59] that I don't believe that's the the only
[1:50:01] ones I just really felt something
[1:50:02] special uh about this this particular
[1:50:05] time so if we don't care I don't want to
[1:50:07] put you on the spot but just so we can
[1:50:08] pray together if those of you that are
[1:50:10] going to get baptized today maybe just
[1:50:12] come up with us and and uh the stand up
[1:50:14] in the front and we just want to just
[1:50:17] invite you if you've never been baptized
[1:50:19] in the name of the Lord Jesus just
[1:50:20] Christ I don't know a better day than
[1:50:21] today and if there's something that you
[1:50:24] you know some that are looking for a
[1:50:25] renewal in their life and uh but we just
[1:50:28] we don't ever want to get in the way of
[1:50:29] that or hinder it uh but we just want
[1:50:31] God's will in your life amen and so uh
[1:50:33] we just want to support but maybe as a
[1:50:35] body of Believers we want to pray for
[1:50:37] these and and knowing that they're doing
[1:50:39] uh something special in their life and
[1:50:41] this is a moment that God has turned us
[1:50:43] around and and brother Mark I I believe
[1:50:45] that God this same God that he has the
[1:50:47] ability Brother David to take what he
[1:50:49] put in in you and bring it out of you he
[1:50:52] he's got the ability to take you there
[1:50:53] there's potential in you that that you
[1:50:55] haven't reached and brother Wesley we we
[1:50:57] just want to reach our full potential
[1:50:58] this morning amen so let's just bow our
[1:51:00] heads and pray for these as we go
