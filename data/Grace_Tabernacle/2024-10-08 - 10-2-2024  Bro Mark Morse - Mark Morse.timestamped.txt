[39:36] well let's hope not but you know it it's
[39:39] just surprising right here on this old
[39:40] dirt Gravel Road and you see people
[39:43] coming out here and some of their nice
[39:45] new cars and but they still make the
[39:47] trip come out here to hear the word of
[39:48] the Lord amen it sure is appreciated
[39:51] tonight amen in 2 Timothy 3 and6
[39:55] through1 17 the Bible
[39:57] says all scripture is given by
[40:01] inspiration of God and is profitable for
[40:04] Doctrine for
[40:06] Repro for correction for instruction and
[40:10] righteousness that the man of God may be
[40:13] perfect thoroughly furnished unto all
[40:16] good
[40:17] works amen if you just want to Bow your
[40:19] head I've got one more scripture I want
[40:20] to read just right after this but
[40:23] Heavenly Father Lord we just thank you
[40:24] for your mercy here tonight Lord we
[40:26] thank you most of all for your presence
[40:31] Lord Lord we come out here and we just
[40:33] know you're here with us and God you you
[40:36] don't there's nothing that says you have
[40:38] to be here but by your word you're here
[40:42] we thank you Lord for that my father I
[40:44] pray that this service would be about
[40:46] you Lord and everything that's spoken
[40:48] would be towards you and that you would
[40:50] get all the praise and all the honor
[40:51] this evening God I pray that the needs
[40:54] of the people would be met father that
[40:56] we would move ourselves out of the way
[40:58] and that you would just speak tonight in
[40:59] Jesus name we pray amen amen you can be
[41:02] seated as uh you don't have to turn here
[41:06] but in Romans 11:
[41:09] 33-36 the Bible says oh the depth of the
[41:13] riches both of the wisdom and knowledge
[41:16] of God how unsearchable are his
[41:19] judgments and his ways past finding out
[41:23] for who hath known the mind of the Lord
[41:26] or who hath been his C counselor or who
[41:29] hath first given to him and it shall be
[41:33] recompensed unto him again for of him
[41:37] and through him and to him are all
[41:40] things to whom be glory forever
[41:45] amen I don't really do this a lot but I
[41:48] want to speak about a source tonight I
[41:52] know that but a source is the place
[41:55] where something begins where it Springs
[41:58] into
[41:59] being and just to kind of lay a
[42:01] foundation when you talk about
[42:04] civilization when you talk about life
[42:06] that that many times that life always
[42:08] begins a near or river because that is
[42:11] the place to where they can be watered
[42:14] they can be fed there are three things
[42:16] that a civilization needed that a people
[42:18] needs in order to kind of get going we
[42:20] know that the basic needs are people are
[42:23] uh are food water and shelter but if
[42:25] you're going to have a group of people
[42:27] people you need three different things
[42:29] you need fertile ground you need fresh
[42:31] water and you need seed and I thank God
[42:34] if you'll just think about that for a
[42:36] minute and you start thinking about how
[42:37] that God comes in this place there's
[42:39] seed laying right here tonight there's
[42:41] seed in this place there's seed in the
[42:43] church there's seed in the message
[42:45] there's seed all over the world and
[42:46] guess what there's also some fertile
[42:48] ground here amen we can take that seed
[42:51] and we can put it into the into the
[42:52] fertile ground and guess what happens
[42:54] next the water begins to come and begins
[42:56] to pour over the seed and in that ground
[42:59] where that seed is planted things start
[43:01] to grow and things start to change it
[43:03] might look a little dark at first but
[43:05] but you just wait just a few minutes
[43:07] just a few days and you'll see as the
[43:10] seed begins to come up and we always
[43:12] talk about the farmer how that he's
[43:14] standing out there and you never see him
[43:15] out in his field you never see him out
[43:18] there trying to coax the seed up he's
[43:20] never out there trying to baby it he's
[43:21] never out there trying to say little
[43:23] seed I wish you would come up I wish you
[43:25] would just come up out of that Darkness
[43:27] I wish you would come up out of that
[43:28] place but the farmer has trust in the
[43:31] Sun the farmer has trust in the power
[43:34] the farmer has trust in the authority of
[43:36] nature the farmer has trust at God that
[43:39] in God that that seed is going to grow
[43:41] and you find yourself in a dark place
[43:43] sometimes and you find yourself
[43:44] wondering where God is at but trust in
[43:47] the Lord trust in the source because the
[43:49] source is fixing to pull you out the
[43:51] energy from the Sun is going to pull you
[43:53] out and I'm not talking about the Su in
[43:56] I'm talking about the over him when that
[43:58] Spirit comes around when it starts
[44:00] changing people's lives when it starts
[44:02] moving across this place when you start
[44:04] feeling a heat of the pillar of fire
[44:06] things begin to change in your life
[44:08] things begin to change and your roots
[44:10] begin to break out and they start going
[44:12] in the places where you didn't know they
[44:14] could go and you need a good foundation
[44:17] you need that seed you need them Roots
[44:19] if you don't have those roots you don't
[44:20] have anything cuz it ain't going to be
[44:22] just a minute and something's going to
[44:23] come along and pull you up and it ain't
[44:25] going to mean a thing come on but you
[44:27] need to be well grounded in the word of
[44:29] God you need to be well suited in the
[44:31] word of God that's why it's so important
[44:34] to take your Bible and to start reading
[44:36] about the source and start following
[44:38] after the source that's why it's so
[44:40] important to gain the foundation that's
[44:42] what that that's why we have Youth and
[44:44] that's why we teach them that's why we
[44:46] we have program or not programs but we
[44:48] have church camps and things that's why
[44:50] we do those things because you need the
[44:52] foundation if you don't have a
[44:54] foundation it ain't going to be just a
[44:56] minute and something's going to happen
[44:57] you might be able to last for a while W
[45:00] with a with a little bit of a shaky
[45:01] Foundation but you let the wind start
[45:03] blowing a little bit you let the trial
[45:05] start coming a little bit and I promise
[45:07] you you're going to be flat on your back
[45:09] and you're going to be going wondering
[45:10] why in the world why am I in the shape
[45:12] I'm in is because the foundation that
[45:15] you're built upon the foundation you
[45:17] haven't got your roots in and many times
[45:20] it takes it takes a little bit of time
[45:22] to dig your roots and it takes a little
[45:24] bit of time to dig down and to get to
[45:26] those places
[45:27] now I begin to think about how that we
[45:30] talk about the civilization calls for
[45:32] ferti ground fresh water and seed and I
[45:34] want you to talk about a source for a
[45:36] minute and y'all I'm trying not to get
[45:38] technical but I don't know any other way
[45:39] of saying it but you look at the
[45:41] Mississippi River and now how the
[45:44] Mississippi River starts running and
[45:46] when men started going up to Mississippi
[45:49] from New Orleans they started moving up
[45:51] to Mississippi they started going places
[45:53] where they couldn't go it was a source
[45:56] of a place where they needed to go and
[45:58] they would start moving up that River
[46:00] now the Mississippi River just it
[46:02] provides life for everybody around here
[46:04] I don't know if you know that or not but
[46:06] if you think about it because it
[46:07] provides food it provides shelter it
[46:10] provides many different things it
[46:11] provides the economy just just uh over
[46:14] in Memphis it provides great things
[46:16] because it is a source of life for many
[46:18] people many people go and they get on
[46:20] the river and they you know they go on
[46:22] the boats and they make their living on
[46:23] the river but the ground outside the
[46:26] Mississippi and I'll tell you something
[46:27] what happened back a few couple hundred
[46:30] years ago back in the
[46:31] 1800s that the the the ground wasn't as
[46:34] fertile as it is now I don't know if you
[46:35] when you go to Memphis you start seeing
[46:37] the fields and you start seeing how many
[46:39] there are when you cross over the Black
[46:42] River brid you start seeing the the
[46:43] Mississippi River delta you start seeing
[46:45] how the growth is there you start seeing
[46:47] all those things but what happened that
[46:50] ground was not like that at first but
[46:53] there was a shaking that took place in
[46:55] the 1800s it was a great earthquake that
[46:57] happened it was such a shaking that the
[47:00] the river the the mighty Mississippi
[47:02] that we all talk about ran backwards for
[47:05] a few days and what happened was that
[47:07] life that was laying in that River The
[47:10] Source went out up onto the banks and it
[47:12] flooded over into the ground that was
[47:15] there and it flooded it started flooding
[47:18] all the ground around it and the
[47:19] nutrients oh Lord I hope you're catching
[47:22] this but the nutrients that were down in
[47:24] that River from all the life and all the
[47:26] I hate to say this but all the Decay and
[47:28] all the stuff that was in the river was
[47:30] nutrients that that that ground needed
[47:33] and it flooded over onto there and it
[47:36] started it started the nutrients from
[47:38] the river started creating a more
[47:40] fertile ground and many men started
[47:43] moving into the into the area that's how
[47:45] we get get the people started moving
[47:47] into Arkansas because they started uh
[47:50] taking away land from the Indians
[47:51] because the ground was so fertile and
[47:53] they saw an opportunity or a chance to
[47:56] take control
[47:58] and that's just your history lesson for
[47:59] the day but but you see that that life
[48:02] and that source that is laying in that
[48:03] river is moving people but what Watch
[48:07] What Happens now watch when you start
[48:09] moving away from that source and you
[48:12] start coming north or south or east or
[48:14] west you start moving this
[48:17] direction and as you cross the the Black
[48:19] River Bridge you start seeing a little
[48:22] bit of uh You Don't See Fields
[48:24] anymore you don't see life anymore
[48:27] you don't see a lot of growth you don't
[48:29] see a lot of food you see a lot of you
[48:30] know a lot of trees and stuff like that
[48:33] but you can't plant anything there see
[48:36] what happened was you moved away from
[48:37] the
[48:38] source and I find that many times people
[48:41] in their lives they start to move away
[48:43] from the source they they they find that
[48:46] this source is what you need this source
[48:48] is what you're living under but you
[48:50] can't bottle The Source up you can't
[48:52] take the source away when you start
[48:54] bottling it up and you start trying to
[48:56] man him handle it and you start trying
[48:59] to take your own theories you start
[49:00] trying to take your own ideas you start
[49:02] trying to take your own Spirit you start
[49:05] trying to take these things away from
[49:07] that Source it's got no life in it when
[49:10] you take this this this water you know I
[49:12] could drink it all day it's got a little
[49:13] bit of life for me in it but it come
[49:15] from a source it come from somewhere it
[49:17] come from a spring
[49:19] right it came from a Wellspring a
[49:22] lifegiving source and it came from such
[49:25] a source that the little animals could
[49:27] walk up to that source and they could
[49:28] begin to drink on it you could ask the
[49:30] source why are you so bubbly and he said
[49:33] you know what I don't really know well
[49:35] why are you so happy Christians why you
[49:37] so happy little bride but but sometimes
[49:39] I don't really understand sometimes I
[49:41] really get a little bit confused I don't
[49:43] really know but there's something inside
[49:45] of me there's something pushing me
[49:47] there's something making me go a little
[49:48] step further there's something made me
[49:50] making me work a little harder I might
[49:52] be down I might be a little out but
[49:55] there's a Wellspring flowing for deep
[49:57] inside of me it starts stirring my heart
[49:59] it starts flowing on Wednesday night it
[50:01] starts flowing on Sunday morning it
[50:03] starts flowing throughout the middle of
[50:05] the day in the middle of the night when
[50:07] you get weary when you get tired that
[50:09] Source begins to Bubble Up and the oh
[50:11] good lord Hallelujah the source begins
[50:14] to move you it moves you over here it
[50:16] moves you over there but don't get away
[50:18] from it don't get up into the ground of
[50:21] Black Rock because you
[50:24] can't amen it's a little hard to live
[50:27] there it's a little hard to live in the
[50:29] Rocks it's a little hard to live in that
[50:31] place and you start finding as you get
[50:34] away from the Life Source you get into a
[50:36] dry desert land and out there that you
[50:40] know the only way you're getting
[50:42] anything out there is a man-made idea
[50:44] the only way they can grow anything
[50:48] oh the only way that they can grow
[50:51] anything out there is through man-made
[50:53] religion that's the only way because
[50:56] once you get out into the desert land
[50:58] there's no longer a connection with a
[51:00] source and man has to take it man has to
[51:03] handle it man has to do something with
[51:05] it and he's got to take the water and
[51:07] he's got to somehow figure out a way to
[51:10] get it over here to the desert but I
[51:12] know a source that if you're dry I know
[51:15] a place I know a man that can I know a
[51:18] Wellspring of Living Water that could
[51:20] take your dry spirit and your dryness
[51:22] and all those things and and even when
[51:24] you're down and out he can just walk
[51:26] walk by he can give you a little bit of
[51:28] water he can give you a little bit from
[51:30] The Source he can give you a little bit
[51:32] from The Fountain and you spring right
[51:34] up and you say hallelujah you say praise
[51:36] be to God you say I don't know what I
[51:38] was thinking but I feel a whole lot
[51:40] better now I feel like dancing a little
[51:42] bit I feel like shouting a little bit
[51:45] I'm feeling something stirring inside of
[51:48] me amen you ever felt that way tonight
[51:51] heyen you felt down and out you felt
[51:54] weary you felt beat up you felt like the
[51:57] world was against you but God said watch
[52:00] this and he gave you a drink of water
[52:02] and your sin sick condition God said
[52:05] watch this I'll take the Harlot and I'll
[52:07] turn their life around I'll take the
[52:09] drug addict I'll turn their life around
[52:12] I'll take that old cranky spirit and
[52:13] I'll turn their life around because
[52:15] there's something I am the Living Water
[52:18] I am everything to them and when God
[52:20] Jesus Christ becomes everything to you
[52:23] it starts turning your life around it
[52:26] starts moving all the crankiness out it
[52:28] starts moving the spirits out it starts
[52:30] moving the depression out it moves it
[52:33] all out because there is a lifegiving
[52:37] source keep near the source live near
[52:40] the source something that's got to
[52:44] move is that great shaking took
[52:47] place sometimes in your life you know
[52:50] you gotten away from the source a little
[52:52] bit then there's a
[52:54] shaking amen
[52:57] God said you got to get back to the
[52:58] source you got to get back over here by
[53:00] the river there's a River of Life you
[53:03] need to get back over here that great
[53:05] earthquake changed the whole world it
[53:07] changed a bunch changed the whole
[53:10] country it changed the whole nation that
[53:12] source of life that was
[53:14] there you realize the Mississippi River
[53:17] is the great has the greatest largest
[53:19] tributary system in the in the
[53:22] world you can't go to any other country
[53:25] and go up there rivers and can hardly
[53:27] get anywhere but that river that source
[53:30] of life goes into
[53:33] places that no man can
[53:36] reach
[53:38] again that river that you all see that
[53:41] is a mile wide in some places I think
[53:45] that little river if you've ever seen a
[53:47] picture I don't know if you ever looked
[53:48] it up in itha or up in uh
[53:52] Minnesota it's a stream it's a little
[53:55] old stream that you could just almost
[53:57] step
[53:59] across sometimes I find that in your
[54:01] life that that that many times you feel
[54:04] like it's just a little stream just just
[54:06] a little stream flowing but you start
[54:08] moving down that River and you start
[54:10] seeing some changes you start seeing it
[54:13] instead instead of the land and the
[54:16] things around it controlling the river
[54:18] the river starts controlling what's
[54:20] going on around it it's Oh Glory The
[54:23] Source begins to change things as it
[54:26] flows as it moved throughout the world
[54:29] and throughout the the life and and
[54:31] throughout eons of time rivers start
[54:33] changing things sources start changing
[54:36] things it starts getting through rock
[54:39] that you couldn't get through and it
[54:40] that water just begins to beat on the
[54:42] Rock and beat on the Rock and beat on
[54:45] the Rock and pretty soon it makes its
[54:47] way around the Rock and the rock is no
[54:49] longer
[54:51] uh the rock is no longer in the
[54:54] way why what is it do it it takes those
[54:57] Stony Stony things takes those old
[55:00] pointy rocks and sometimes you get them
[55:03] in your life there's old pointy pointy
[55:05] rocks you know if how many of y'all ever
[55:06] walked around a creek somewhere and you
[55:08] step on those those pointy rocks
[55:10] somewhere that
[55:12] hurts sometimes our life gets that way
[55:14] sometimes we get those pointy rocks but
[55:17] just let the source start
[55:18] flowing let it start changing you let it
[55:22] start developing a different kind of
[55:24] Life inside of you let it start moving
[55:29] moving he man you got to give it
[55:32] away don't move away from it get moving
[55:35] towards it your life needs it the
[55:38] civilizations they needed that life
[55:40] there they had no way of moving things
[55:42] they had no way of changing things they
[55:44] needed that you need that you need the
[55:47] source you need the source toight you
[55:50] need to go home anytime and pick up the
[55:52] source and find out what it has to say
[55:54] when you can't when you're trying to
[55:55] read something out go pick up the source
[55:58] and see what it has to say go play a
[56:00] tape see what that has to say you want
[56:02] to talk about a source there's two
[56:04] different types of sources in in English
[56:07] there's a primary source and there's a
[56:09] secondary
[56:10] source now sorry for the lessons but a
[56:15] primary source is somebody is a witness
[56:19] that was standing there watching it
[56:22] happen Okay a secondary source is
[56:25] somebody that hear is that
[56:27] person
[56:29] okay but a primary
[56:32] source you've heard about the things of
[56:34] God but I can tell you you had a prophet
[56:38] that stepped out of time he saw Visions
[56:42] he didn't just see from a secondary
[56:45] point of view he saw from a primary
[56:48] point of view and that man opened up the
[56:50] scriptures and he said this is exactly
[56:52] how it is and he started ministering to
[56:55] you he started ministering to the bride
[56:57] I don't want some secondary source I
[57:00] don't want some idea of some man give me
[57:02] the primary source give me somebody
[57:04] that's been there give me a God that
[57:06] stepped out of History I don't want a
[57:08] historical God I want a god of right now
[57:10] and you have seen that God of right now
[57:13] you've seen him step out of History
[57:15] you've seen him heal the blinded ey
[57:17] you've seen him heal cancer you've seen
[57:19] him do these things left and right
[57:21] you've seen him do all that you are a
[57:23] primary source of God's power you are
[57:26] primary source of God's control and what
[57:28] God can do and I would go tell the world
[57:32] you know what I've seen it I've seen God
[57:34] move I've seen the hand of the
[57:38] Lord amen you can tell them you can tell
[57:42] them you know what well you know what I
[57:45] you know I got problems well God said
[57:47] watch
[57:49] this I got issues God says no no no
[57:53] watch this there was one time that the
[57:56] that the that the
[57:58] enemy that there was a a little baby
[58:02] born his name was Jesus and I can just
[58:05] see and I I I can just see up in heaven
[58:08] how that how that you know they're
[58:09] getting ready they know something's

[1:05:15] lot about him but he comes in contact
[1:05:17] with the source of all
[1:05:21] life and he looks at
[1:05:24] him and you can see you you know if you
[1:05:26] could just imagine that a little bit of
[1:05:29] clarity might have come over his eyes
[1:05:32] because he looked into the eyes of that
[1:05:34] man he looked into the eyes of the
[1:05:37] source and he looked and he
[1:05:39] went what are you doing in there cuz he
[1:05:43] knew there was something down inside of
[1:05:45] that man named Jesus that wasn't just a
[1:05:48] man that he was God standing there in
[1:05:50] human flesh he was God waiting to do
[1:05:52] something for him and that devil and
[1:05:55] those demons and all that was inside of

[1:06:23] him that man named Legion
[1:06:26] the next time we hear of him he wanted
[1:06:28] to go with
[1:06:30] Jesus but Jesus needed a testimony of
[1:06:34] who he was Jesus oh Lord Jesus needed a
[1:06:38] testimony of his power Jesus needs a
[1:06:41] testimony of his authority and what are
[1:06:44] you hey man some of you might have felt
[1:06:46] like Legion but you're a testimony of
