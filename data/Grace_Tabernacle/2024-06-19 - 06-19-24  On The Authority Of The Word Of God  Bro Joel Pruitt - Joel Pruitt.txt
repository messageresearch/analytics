house for them and U she told me just to feel free to tell the church she said we're part of the body so the body you ought to know and um we just covet the prayers of the saints that the Lord would help her and and I know that's hard decisions to make and they've been such a such a blessing to us over the years and and U I know she longs to be in church and there's a lot of thing that goes with it but we just want her to know that she's on our heart and we just you know if there's a way you may can reach out or something if you have moment on your heart maybe just shoot a a message and and we'll let you know as things progress but just it's just a real burden on my heart today so just ask you to remember them in prayer and let's just bow our heads together and if you have a need on your

and can we just sing this at the sister play and only believe all things are possible and ask brother Joel to come only believe only believe all things are possible only only only believe all things are possible only believe I say Lord I believe Lord I [Music] Lord I oh Lord I believe yes Lord I believe that all things are possible Lord I one more time Jesus is here oh Jesus is here oh Jesus is here all things are possible Jesus is here oh Jesus oh if you believe it sing it now Jesus is here and all things are possible Jesus is here how many believe that tonight believe Jesus is here and where the spirit of the Lord is there is Liberty do you believe that there's nothing I can say to you tonight to help you but if he would come down and speak to you and maybe Use Somebody Like Me Maybe that's unworthy to be here but if he could speak then there's not a not a demon in hell that could stand in the way of of what he says tonight you believe that and so without without ad do I get out of singing tonight I'll sing one you can be seated for a minute if you know it we'll sing it if not I'm out of it let me tell you what it is I got to turn my timer off I can't be using my time for singing [Music] in the beginning the world was formed by your [Music] design with just a word the sun began to [Music] shine oh you created the lowest Val and the mountains [Music] tall and you made something out of nothing at all oh I was nothing just a beggar as hopeless as could could be but Ain it's something I'm now an air to Heaven's royalty you gave me life in my darkness you gave me strength each time might fall oh you made something out of nothing at all oh I was nothing I was say full of empty Wasted Years oh and I was so lost so full of doubt and fear oh but then you reach down you heard my anguish had I desperate call yes you did and you made something out of nothing at all oh I was nothing just a beggar as hopeless as could be but ained something I'm now an air to Heaven's royalty you gave me life in my darkness you gave me strength each time i' fall oh you made something out of nothing at all you gave me light oh you gave me light in my darkness you gave me strength each time i' fall oh you made something out of nothing at all did he do it for you he made something out of nothing at all can you say amen amen that'll be all the music tonight if you'd stand to your feet this evening we'll get right into the word and I'm sorry you didn't know that one but hey that's okay next time we'll do it we'll practice first but that's okay hey I tell you what the words are good he made something out of nothing just think where you'd be if it had not been for Jesus if it had not been for the Lord on my side I tell you what I would have no hope but if it wasn't for him I would be of all men most hopeless and I would be I I would be a man that would have no future but he reached down and saw me in my darkest hour and he chose to come to me I didn't come looking for him but he came looking for me can you say Amen tonight well that's not in my sermon or my notes but we'll just get right on into it tonight and if you have your Bibles it's numbers 20 and verse S I want to say uh I want to thank brother Matt for the opportunity to stand here tonight and the confidence to allow allow me to be here this evening and I sure appreciate all of your fellowship uh for the meetings and stuff that yall Put on We we enjoy it and uh we also appreciate when you come and fellowship with us so we kind of feel like this is our sister church and so uh we we love you all and I know that you all love us too so we we really do appreciate that and a place to come and and have meetings with people that will just just have church you know that's that's fun to come and just have church and them tent meetings I tell you what you know I don't know your plans but I hope you don't quit having them because I really like those tent meetings and and so put a little pressure on your pastor there for that one Numbers Chapter 20 and verse 7 and the Lord spake unto Moses saying take the rod and gather thou the assembly together thou and Aaron thy brother and speak ye unto the rock before their eyes and it shall give forth his water and thou shalt bring forth to them water out of the rocks so Thou shalt give the congregation and their beasts drink and one more that I didn't give you brother up there is Matthew it's Matthew chapter 8 and we're going to start with verse five Matthew chapter 8 and verse 5 and when Jesus was entered into capernium there came unto him a centurion beseeching him and saying Lord my servant lith at home sick of the Paul's grievously tormented and Jesus saith unto him I will come and heal him and the Centurion answered and said Lord I'm not worthy that thou should come under my roof but speak the word only and my servant shall be healed you may be seated this evening may the Lord add His blessings to the reading of the word just in the thoughts here this evening if I could have a thought I would call it on the authority of the word of the Lord on the authority of the word of God and I would just say it like this you know there's a difference in power and authority we've been given Authority uh by by by a supernatural power in this day but we don't have so much power in ourselves you know if you're looking to me for power I may not have any power brother Mark but we have an authority to speak because of the word that we've been given and so you know you can you could have the you can have the power to go beat down a door but if you don't have if you don't have the key then you don't have the authority to be there but if you have been given the key then you can possess what's in behind the door why is that because you've been given authority to go into the Promises of God so if you have the key and I believe we have the key this evening I believe believe I believe we've been given a key I believe we have everything we need to make a Rapture I believe we have a key to open every door if it's a if it's a door that's been locked by sickness just put the key in of faith and open that door and there's healing on the other side of the door so what you have is authority to speak the word and go forward nothing can stop you no door can stop you because you have the key no nothing can stop you that Satan would put in your way no chain can stop you there there's nothing can stop you why because you've been given Authority you are a people of authority well can somebody say Amen you have authority tonight it is not it is not a power that has come from a man but it is a power that come from God that has given us Authority and brother Brandon would say it like this just to lay a background he said as a mortal being knowing that I have no power within myself that's a prophet speaking I have no power I don't have power to stop you I don't have power to make any of these we these women clean up I don't have power to make these men clean up that's listening to this tape or wherever I have no way of making them clean up I'm powerless but I do have the authority of God's word as a servant to preach it and I'm Duty bound to that Authority can you say Amen neither this policeman out here he tells a story the little policeman he don't have power to stop the car but that badge gave him an authority to put his hand up and stop the car didn't M no matter how big that devil is that's coming after you the word of God has given you an authority to to put your back put your hand up and say you know what you may come against me but you cannot Prosper because no weapon formed against me can prosper you say how can you say that on the authority of the word of God everything that's in the Bible everything that's in this message that's my authority to speak it's not good enough just to say well it was good for brother Brandon it's not good enough to say well it's good enough for the Bible days no it's got to be it's got to be a present day Authority it's got to be something for the people today we are living in a bad time we are living in an age where the world is in chaos but for the bride you have an authority to overcome in this hour that we're living in you don't have to worry about where your meals are coming from because he promised to feed you you don't have to worry about where your healing is coming from because he promised in his word do you realize who you are you are a people of Promise living in a land of promise and you have authority you know them grapes were for everybody but they were for the ones that would go over and when the Giants were in their way they didn't care about no Giants they wanted to benefit from the fruits of the land why because they knew that if they were marching in God's in God's Army then God would go before him no giant could stop him well come on somebody nothing can stop the Church of God nothing can stop this bride because we have been given authority to overcome every devil and every sickness and every disease everything that would come against us chains may be put on you tonight but you have the authority to speak and those chains will fall off of you well if a certain preacher would come by or if a certain person would come by no you have the authority to speak I'm not worthy that would you would come under my roof but I know you would Jesus said I'll come and heal you no but I'm not even worthy that you would come under my roof but I know you're good and you'll do it anyway he don't have to show up in this service tonight but he did it anyway I'm not worthy that he would come and and let me stand before you people but he but he put me here to speak the word of God to you and that word is an authority that if you have a problem here tonight just grab a hold of that word and you can leave free you can leave healed you can leave perfectly whole and a total Deliverance is yours tonight everything you need is in this message how many beli that tonight everything you need every everything you need to make a Rapture is already here I'm not waiting on a I'm not waiting on the prophet to come back I'm not waiting on nothing else to happen I know what I know in whom I have believed and he is more than able to keep that which he has promised he's more than able when he told Moses he said speak to the Rock don't Smite it he said that meant speak don't Smite it you see you've got to obey what he says do no man can do nothing in himself he's got to hear it first from God yes sir you can't do this on your own if you're trying to make it on your own you're just I tell you what you're just another sinner that's trying to make it on their own you're just another person trying to make it on your own works but it's by grace that you're here tonight and by Grace he showed you a message that in this message is the potential for all things but you've got to accept it you've been pardoned you've been given the land you you've been made free but you've got to come and accept it as your Authority here tonight yes sir well can the church say Amen brother Bram says like this I just want to lay this background before I lose my all my time the days that he brought Israel out he had one man and that was Moses and brother R says he always deals with one man how many knows that to be true he said there was daythan and many others that tried to think well they had the same Authority and so forth he said you know what happened to them the days of the coming of the Lord the days of John the Baptist and the different ones he has one individual he works with and he deals with us today as one individual and not as a group well so when you look around say well the church has got problems no no no what about you see we've got to O overcome as an individual it's good to see the church on fire but when you are getting cold it's nice to sit in a church where the fires are glowing and it's hot but if you're cold then you need a checkup tonight it's not about what I tell you what I love to go into a church that's on Revival it's in Revival but let me tell you something don't look at them and say well I'm going to get warmed off of their their Revival I'm going to get war no no no you got to have a Revival yourself you've got to recognize the word has come for you individually you have no authority to go in on somebody else's experience but you have authority when you met God I tell you Moses had no authority to go into Egypt and Conquer Pharaoh he had no authority to go down there he had no Authority at all until he heard a voice he heard a voice that said go down there and I'll be with you and take care and and let me tell you something when you stay in the will of God then you have authority can somebody say Amen you have authority to overcome every obstacle that would come against you and so what I would say tonight it is even though Moses was 80 years old even though Moses didn't look like he had any power even though Moses didn't look like he had any Authority he was given a god-given Authority by a voice that he heard well I wish somebody to hear me tonight he had heard a voice and he didn't just say well the voice is in the wilderness go talk to him sir and he'll speak for me no now Moses had something to do there's too many of us living in the past too many of us wait when brother Brandon if brother Brandon was here brother brand no no no he's given you the authority he's given you a voice you are the final voice to the final age you've been given that Authority we're not waiting on something else to give us Authority The Authority is here the word has come the open book's here eat the book and speak the words of Life over your family speak it over your children well I wish somebody preach with me tonight you have the authority to speak it's not about me it's not about you brother Matt don't have the authority to build a church here but but not not on his own but God told him to do it and under that Authority he don't have to worry about the winds blowing this way and the winds blowing that way if you're under the authority of the word of God you can go forward you don't have to fear you don't have to worry because God said so how many believes that tonight brother R says it like this he says he says let me get down here he said all that was in God was poured out into Christ all that was in Christ was emptied out into the believer the church God is with you he said Lo I'm with you always even to the end of the world that's the Declaration of God's word and that's what the Bible says and brother brand says that's what I believe so you say I'm walking this alone you're never alone you can be by yourself and you're never alone if you're a Believer and you've accepted this end time message and and you've and you've experienced the baptism of the Holy Ghost and you've had the Seal of God on your life listen you're not alone and you're stronger than any army in the world even by yourself well I need somebody with me I need somebody on my side God's on your side you don't have to fear imagine Moses going down there they've got the finest armies they've got chariots and he's walking down there with a stick does that look like I tell you what that makes no sense to this world that makes no sense to me in my carnal mind that makes makes no sense to any of you in your carnal mind but because you heard the word and you believe the word then you know all things are possible with God so you know it wasn't an old 80-year-old man walking down there but God was in that man God was using that man and you may not have the strength to walk out that door tonight but God is with you withs soever thou goest everywhere The Souls of your feet with tread God is there and he is always with you brother B uses it and Matthew 28 he quotes 28 Matthew 28:20 teaching them to observe all things after the commission whatsoever I have commanded you and lo I'm with you always even unto the end of the world the end of the world is not here so he's still with you I tell you what we we get out of the word and we get out from under our Authority and that's when bad things start to happen to us I'm not talking about I'm not talking about people saying well you're a secret sinner no I'm saying you have no you have no ability to have faith because you have no word to back you up but when the word backs you up you can stand there and say you know what you can say what you want to you can call me a Holy Roller you can call me a fanatic you can call me anything but when the roll is Called Up Yonder call me gone why because I ain't going to be here to worry about no tribulation time I ain't going to be here to worry about I I I tell you what I'm not stalking up I'm not getting ready for no tribulation because I have no intentions on being here in the tribulation because a prophet said well a prophet said and that's my authority he said before one drop of fire could fall then we have to be gone and before one bomb could be released he said we'll be caught up we we may be looking back down at it happening but we will not be here to go through the fires of tribulation you might as well kick that devil while you're here because if the devil's telling you I may have to go through a tribulation buddy know that's wrong that's absolutely false you don't need to why would you ever take that why would you take that as your absolute why would why would you take that as your word why would you believe something like that when the Bible says you have a promise when the when the Bible speaks about a second coming when the Bible speaks about a coming about a body change when the prophet would come and say in the moment in the twinkling of an eye we'll be caught up that's what I want to believe why because it's in the word I have authority to believe that and there's going to be a generation I don't believe it's going to be long I believe it's going to be a young generation of people here tonight and maybe some old ones too that will not taste death but you'll see the coming of the Lord you ain't got to worry about death anyway because death is just a changing of that body anyway one way or another we're all going to have a body change if you're in Christ you well I wish somebody would say Amen now if you're in Christ there is nothing can stop you from a body change it's your Authority that's your word Authority brother Mark that's your word Authority you ain't always got to look like that it's your word Authority that you're going to have a body change some of us are ready a little quicker than others right some of us are like Lord come quickly because I can't live in this body forever I told my brother that the other day I had to pick on you cuz he wasn't sitting there but I said when you start looking like Ben and I you're ready for a body change well we're all ready because on your best days on your best days you're in a body of Flesh fighting three kinds of Believers or the Believers fighting the other two or the unbeliever I'll tell you what it's just it's just a rat race it's just the the you know the wheels are spinning but the hamster's dead it's just it's just like a vicious circle you just keep going and and all you can think is this think about it think about it on your best day brother Matt you're worth about 84 cents because you weigh about 150 PBS I'm I'm worth more than brother Matt but on your best day that's all you are I'm talking about the flesh man that's all you are that's all I am is flesh but God doesn't even see you like that what God sees is a is a Perfection well can you say am man because he's looking at a sinful nature but he's looking at it through the blood and he sees Perfection over your life I have authority to be perfected under the word of the hour well I hope you're following me so far I want to I want to get I want to get where I'm going Lord help me Jesus had all the fine qualities of God in him do you believe it can you say amen he had powers upon Powers but when he met Satan he never used his power listen to me he never used his power he give an example for the weakest of Christians the weakest I'm not going to ask you who the weakest is because on some days it might be me on some days it might be you on some days you just have a bad day but on that day Jesus gave you an example of how to overcome the devil when he met Satan he said it is written man shall not live by bread alone but by every word somebody say every word every word that proceeds out of the mouth of God the weakest Christian can take that stand and hold it he said sure God's in his word every time when he would meet the enemy he said it is written I believe he had power to do it yes sir he had power to defeat Satan he had power to just cast him down right there but he had authority to just speak the word he didn't have to use his own power because he knew you needed an example and you may not feel very powerful but you have the authority the same Authority that he had the weakest Christian can take that stand and hold it I claim that for myself on my weakest days I can take my stand just like Jesus did Satan may be tempting me Satan may be coming against me but I can stand there and say it is written I Heard a Voice I Heard a Voice I've read the word I know it's not just a theological understanding but what it is it came from the Throne of God into my heart and it ignited something on the inside of me that cannot be burned out it can't be taken away because I am part of him and he is well come on somebody it don't matter what the devil says he can't change my mind because my mind can't listen my mind ain't what got me here but something on the inside I can't help but be who I am you can't help us sit here in a message Church why because the devil might tell you well you can get you know you can have you can have a good service at the at the Pentecostal Church well you might have a good service but listen there's no hope for a Rapture because they're not under the end time light I'm not trying to hurt nobody's feelings here tonight is this okay but I want to tell you something you have something nobody else has got you have something something the world don't have you have something the best church out there in the denominations has no clue about this ain't just another Pentecostal move it's a word move and this revival cannot die there's a Revival of cycle and death cycle and death there's a church raised up and die but you know when this church was built it wasn't built on how good you feel it was built on the word of God and the word of God will go across this Pulpit every time there's a service well the church how appreciate having a pastor who don't want nothing up here but the word of God you ought to appreciate a man who says I don't want no Tommy rot in my Pulpit I want the word preached actually love the word of God it will cause a Revival in you see this is not an emotional Revival it it's not just a worked up feeling we don't I tell you what you're just as loud or maybe louder when the preacher preaching as you are when the singers are singing and I like to see that it's okay it's good to shout it's good to praise when the singer you need to we need to praise we need to get ready for battle but when the word's going forth when I can see people responding to that word it shows you've been you you've actually been in tune with the word of God you know when the word is being preached and it's moving upon your heart well come on somebody there's something on the inside of you that cannot be moved by the Fashions of the world there's something on the inside of you that cannot be burned out by just another Pentecostal move but this is a word Revival and you've been blessed to be a part of it I've been blessed to be a part of it this is this is that this is the restoration time this is the time of well I'm getting off my notes but can I go here this is the time where all things are to be fulfilled and if all things are to be fulfilled then there's got to be a bride and our Authority comes from the word this bride will not go listen brother had the vision and and one of them tried to get out of step and he cried get back in Step I want to say tonight stay in line with the word of God the devil's going to try to get you out of step and if you did happen to get out of Step that don't mean you're not bride but you you you would heed a prophet's warning and would get back in line when he screamed out you see it's like this if if you're in the Army and they tell you to March a certain way and you get out of line you may get yelled at you know you might get in trouble but that don't mean you're automatically just kicked out of of the army he's just trying to train you for when the enemy comes well I wish you'd hear me tonight he's training you for war he's training you for battle but here's the difference it's not just a worldly battle it's not just a worldly War he already knows the outcome he just wants some participants that are not going to just get thrown over here and toss this way and toss that way every wind of doctrine's going to come it's going to come against you every weapon's going to be formed but under the authority that has been given in this hour nothing can harm you nothing I'll prove it to you by a quote let me get on down here I got to skip some stuff brother Matt I'm gonna get myself in trouble brother talks about the the Centurion we read about at the beginning he said that Centurion knew that he was the son of God every sickness and every demon was under him and all he had to do is just speak the word not pray or or the Centurion knew that Jesus was all he had to do was just speak the word he didn't have to even come to his house he didn't have to show up in service aren't you glad he does because he's good but he doesn't have to we're not worthy of it brother brandom said and it would be done every demon would have to obey him he said you believe that tonight I can say Amen every demon will obey God it has to everything obeys God and this is what I like it'll obey you if you have faith amen Joshua stopped the son is that true somebody said all things are possible with God nothing's impossible but all things are possible to you also am nothing's impossible to them that believe all things are possible he brought it right down and made you if you just know who God was well I'm afraid that the church doesn't know their Authority if you knew your Authority then nothing is impossible to you well that ought to make somebody shout nothing's impossible well I prayed and I didn't get an answer nothing's impossible with you quit letting the devil tell you that God's not answering he is answering prayers he may not come when you want him but he's always on time you think God wouldn't answering wasn't answering the prayer of Abraham and Sarah all them years yes he was he knew exactly when it would come to pass he was just trying their faith and that trial of your faith is more precious than gold amen that's what the Bible teaches us it's more precious but we want everything right now you know we want everything at our fingertips and well hey that's okay that's human nature but don't let that human nature stop you from getting a blessing from God under the authority of the word it it it God does not God does not respond to our time God does not move in our time clock he doesn't he doesn't have a work day like we do because he he's he's always on the job and to him he knows the exact day when that body will be changed and he knows you have no reason to worry about it not a reason at all but yet our human our human worries get in the way our jobs get in the way our our own understanding sometimes well well brother brandom how does that make sense well I'll tell you what why don't we quit questioning a Vindicated prophet he was Vindicated not me well you can say am man or owe me but that's true anyhow because God saw fit to bring somebody to show you the light in this hour and show a bride how to walk with authority because if you're walking in the word nothing can stop you brother goes on like this he says I have no power to heal that's a prophet now I have no power to heal I have authority when I receive it from God to pronounce something that God has done and he actually references Samson here and he says as long as he could feel those locks hanging around his shoulders it was all right he said when I see him moving Among Us like this I know he's here don't you did you know that when you get in the presence of the Lord a lot of your worry just happens to fall away and when you get in the when you've had a bad winds day it's a good idea to go to church you should go anyway but if you've had a bad day you really need to go because you get in the presence of God and it just seems to lift you up a little higher than the things of the world on Sunday morning when the kids are screaming on the way to church and you're like Lord am I ever going to make it there with my with my mind am I going to go insane on the way to church I've got four kids I know all about it but listen to me listen God knows what you had need of before you got there and he's already got the service prepared to meet your need well the service met something no no he met every need or he's not God oh the service might have been for one no it was for everyone that was here amen you say it wasn't well don't question God did he bring you here did he show up then he wants you here for a purpose this is not just another gathering this is not just another get together but this is a god ordained time this is a season that God saw you sitting right where you're sitting God knew what you needed God knew what I needed God knew what the church needed and he put men in the church it ain't always the flashiest it ain't always the best it ain't always what you would pick but God chose the man Moses may not have been what what what man would choose but God chose Moses there's a lot of men that man would have chose brother brandom may not have been chosen by the modern clergy of his day because he couldn't hardly speak and he didn't have a good education but aren't you glad God chose somebody that we could understand aren't you glad that God chose somebody that wasn't so big and so great that that we that we never thought we could attain that Lev no no God brought God God used somebody just like you and I that could speak like us that could that could stumble just like we do brother Mark he wanted to use that because it's God in Simplicity revealing himself again just like he always did see if God would have used a a man of good clergy then he would have went against the program he've always had you realize he used Moses he used Elijah he used John the Baptist these were not men that come in well dressed in the synagogues no these were these were rugged men these were these were different kind of men these were not men that the world would choose but God has always chosen those things to confound the wise why because he works in ways you don't understand with your carnal mind he works in ways I don't understand with my carnal mind but what he does is always works out things for your good and for my good it doesn't matter what what bad is going on in your life well it does matter and we we worry about that as humans and we think well you know as a pastor brother Matt May sit back there and think well I know this one's going through that and this one's going through that I know my my brother does that he's sitting there like Lord I wish I could help this person but did you know that person and it's hard to tell them maybe you can't tell them but they're going through that for their own good I don't go here so I can get away with that I don't know what you're going through but it's for your good how can I say that because under the authority of the word I can say all things work together for the good good for the perfecting of your body listen we got to go through things on this Earth because we're trying to get somewhere don't be distracted by what's trying to hold you on this earth when there's a whole heavenlies to fly into there's promises everywhere but the devil wants to keep your focus here always looking down look up your Redemption draw nigh that's what I'm looking for that's where I'm going Samson just had to feel those locks do I still have the power of God with me he just had to go back and say yeah I still got the word I've still got it I may be chained between these pillars there may be thousands over here mocking me there may be thousands telling me you can't Pastor there may be thousands telling me that church will never never survive there may be thousands telling you brother Matt that you can never reach the loss there may be thousands telling you you can't overcome that sickness of cancer there may be thousands well come on now the devil's going to be telling you all kinds of Lies but all you got to do is feel that strength of the word come upon you and one time all you got to do is say Lord let these enemy be enemies be Avenged before my eyes let me tell you something did you know that Samson as one man could defeat defeat Mighty armies if God could use Samson in a backsliding condition all he had to do was say Lord are you still here do you remember me I'm in a bad place the Lord had already been there to work it out the strength had already started growing even before he recognized it there's more strength in you than you know that's right I'm a weak Christian no you're not that's the devil telling you I I'm nothing in the church that's the devil talking to you you have a position and if that position is sitting there saying Amen to the word of God stay faithful to that post stay in the house of God don't let the I'll tell you what the devil will never never make you go to church and if he does he's going to tell you to sit there and not participate so if you're here tonight you went against the devil just to be here yes sir and if you resisted the devil then guess what my Bible says he will flee far from you so is it a benefit just going to church yes sir because you've defeated the devil you've went against the devil just to be here tonight well that's just Bible let me tell you something that is the word Authority I'm talking about you can claim every scripture as yours by his stripes I am healed by his stripes I am healed by well you can say that about yourself by his stripes I have overcome depression by his stripes I have come O overcome anxiety you say what's my anxiety quit claiming that nonsense start overcoming it by his stripes I don't have to have anxiety because he died I don't have to live I don't have to live like the world you realize it's all him but he's living through you time is running but here we go can I go to the church AE book I told you I would brother BR said notice the harmony of the father and the son Jesus never did anything until it was first showed him by the father he references John 5:19 this harmony is now to exist between the groom and his bride you need to recognize who you are you are to have the same Harmony that Jesus had with the father I'm not I'm not saying that you're Jesus individually but you are a part of that body that's on earth now let me go a little farther here he shows her his Word of Life she receives it she never doubts it now I read that and can I tell you what happened I doubted it because my mind said how's that possible but something on the inside said a prophet said it I don't ever doubt the word you can call me a doubter if you want to I tell you what this body ain't going anyway it ain't saved anyway but but what's on the inside will never doubt this word I don't care how low in sin you've been there's a reason you're back because something on the inside never doubted that's a lot to swallow but there it is brother R said the word is in the bride as it was in Mary the bride has the mind of Christ for she knows what he wants done with the word she performs the command of the word in his name for she has thus sayith the Lord amen well I wish somebody think about that for a minute oh yeah you have thus sayith the Lord or you keep still but what is thus sayith the lord it's not just something you would speak say well this is going to happen I'm going to start speaking this and speaking Financial Peace and that's not thus sayith the Lord thus sayith the Lord is what God has already said if you read this Bible you can speak that as thus sayith the Lord because that is God's word and he's using your lips to speak it you have thus sayith the Lord a prophet would come with a Vindication he would come with an open book and if youve received the open book and the opening of the word in your day then you can have that same Authority because you can speak the word in its full potential because you know what the Bible says well I hope somebody knows what I'm talking about you know what the Bible says that denominational man or woman May read the same Bible you read and they can read it from Genesis to Revelation my grandpa was a man who I got his or my brother got his Bible when he passed away and and he's got that Bible and he's got it marked on every scripture that he read and some of them two or three times but the man never could see the message of the hour but can I tell you something it wasn't for him he was a westling he come up under that generation he was he could never see the light of this day but let me tell you something you have been privileged to see the message that you've seen and you found it to be a word message this is not outside the Bible this message came with the authority of the word in [Applause] it you really think God would stand there night after night and confirm a lie no sir he was standing there confirming the word to be true that was coming from his messenger and now we see brother B says at Thy word Lord I let down the net 1954 he says we see in the Bible that Jesus Christ the son of God when he came to the Earth he came to rid sin and sickness and divorce it oh aren't you glad of that he's divorced your sin and sickness he put it away forever from his people put it away forever from his people and claim that he would return again and he will but in his absence yeah he gave his church the same Authority amen that he had amen thank you Lord I don't have much time left but I want to get to this right here when Jesus was standing at the grave of Lazarus he wept like a man is that right you're going to grieve over your loved ones if they would pass on before before the Rapture that's part of it you can't help it but there's something on the inside of you that knows that if that body lays down then there's already another one that's raised up we don't grieve as those that have no hope because we know what's waiting for us brother the Joe we have to have that hope that's what we hold on to when you lose a loved one you don't want to be just another person in the world say well I'll never see him again no we have a hope of a better tomorrow brother brand talks about this and I'm going to hurry through this so try to stay with me here for a minute he said Revelations 10:7 he talks about that the the messenger when he shall begin to sound the mysteries of God shall be finished as he ha declared to his servants the prophets there it is he is sending a Vindicated Prophet he's sending a prophet after almost 2,000 years he's sending someone who is far from the organization can you say Amen aren't you glad of that but he said he'll have thus sayith the Lord and speak for God I'm skipping through this this is in the church age book and brother and leat see in church age he said and speak for God he will be God's mouthpiece a he as it is declared in Malachi 4:6 will turn the hearts of the children back to the fathers not back to 1906 but all the way back to like it was at original Pentecost how many understand that to be true and he says and he will restore the truth as they had it just what Paul preached just what Paul this is not something new this is what Paul preached we are the original Apostolic Pentecostals a lot of people can put it on their Church times but we are them we are the real Apostolic Pentecostals we didn't just come up with a name we're living it we didn't we didn't go to 1906 and stop we're coming all the way into the astronaut age we're coming all the way into a translation age we are she that would go all the way in a Rapture brother BR said he'll he will bring back the elect of the last day and they will hear a vindication Prophet give the exact truth as it was with Paul he will restore the truth as they had it aren't you glad of it and and those elect with him in that day will be the ones who truly manifest the Lord and be his body and his voice it's a voice of authority and it's in you that might have been hard for you but listen you have you you are the body of Christ on the earth now can you say Amen to that brother B said you will be his body body and his voice we're going to get to something here in a second I hope you listen brother said you see it he said it in the Lutheran days the lutherans spoke for Luther in the Wesleyan days and I'm skipping some of this so go back and read it if you want to he said the Lu in the Wesleyan days the Wesleyan spoke for Wesley he said and then when the Methodist failed God raised up others and so has it gone on this is the part I want you to get because he's bringing it to our day he said there is again another people in the land amen I would I wish we could stay right there and preach on the land for a minute but we won't there's again another people in the land who under their messenger I've received the message how about you will be the final voice you all know this quote to the final age and he said the church is no longer the mouthpiece because God has turned on the church and and and and he said it is its own mouthpiece they're speaking their own words now they've left off the voice of God it's a strange thing to him but he said he said he said God is turning on her and he will confound her through the prophet and the bride for the voice of God will be in her when you're waiting on the voice of God to come from a man listen what what you're doing is you're saying God is not true because you have the voice of God in you where is the voice of God it's in you when you speak the word that is God speaking you say is that true yes that doesn't diminish a prophet's voice at all we only know who we are because of a prophet's voice so I'm not trying to take anything away from the message but somebody's got to live out the message it's not good enough to say well I hear I heard all the tapes but I can't live it no the bride can live it I know the world can't live it I'm not worried about them living it I know this world's going down I'm not discouraged by politics because it has no bearing on my Eternal my eternal home but what it does is it may discourage the world and it may discourage the make believer and the unbeliever well he's never coming back anyway it's just getting so bad if they could really see the word they know it's got to get this bad it's got to be in total chaos before the destruction be can come but the bride knows that she has Heard a Voice from heaven and that voice will catch her up out of here but it's not just the voice that's going to come back and catch her up the voice is is here you're speaking just like he spoke brother brandom could not say anything but what Paul spoke neither can we you say well I you know I'm outside the word well if you're outside the word you're outside of the authority of God you are no longer under the authority of God but as long as I'm under the authority that I have no fear because this message listen this message has come to change my body this message has came has come to give me hope that is so much greater than anything in any of the ages they did they didn't know the Mysteries they didn't understand who they were they they could see a little bit of light here and a little bit of light there but we're living in a dark time and the light has shown so bright in this age because we see the world in this darkness and we see the contrast of the Bride she's different than the world she lives different talks different what why because she's got a voice in her that's speak in life the world speaking gloom and doom but you're speaking life because God's speaking through [Applause] you let me get on down here brother Ram said they were waiting talk about the upper room they were waiting on something too he said they wasn't presuming right that they had anything they were waiting until the scripture was made manifest see they were under authority of the word of God they knew it was coming because the word said it would come stay with me just a little longer will you do it I'm not near an hour yet you're okay don't look at your watches yet we're good we're doing okay on time so far there's no clock back there I got one right here we're good brother Ram said like this he said after hearing that the blood of Jesus so thoroughly cleanses that there's no more nothing that that complete there's no more nothing that the complete word of God Rest within them I'm them are you part of them all right the complete word of God that the very command of their own voice is creative power amen I hope this is okay is this all right because in them is the Holy Ghost there's the key without the Holy Ghost you can't speak as the voice of God but if you have the Holy Ghost that's important young people you're not going to make it in on your dads or your moms or your grandparents you're not going to make it in on their experience you're not going to make it in on their salvation you're not going to make it in on their Holy Ghost you're not going to make it in because you felt good at Youth Camp but you're going to make it in because you have experienced a change in your body it is a birth that has to take place and yes it's a mess yes it's bad yes it it may you may have to get down at that altar maybe it doesn't happen the first time but don't stop trying to receive that Holy Ghost because God knows when you really mean business with him he's there willing and able to fill you with the Holy Ghost he knows you need it you can't make it without it and when you receive that you can speak words of life because then the the the the very life of God comes into the believer that's what a prophet teaches us we don't have to worry yes sir well I tell you what I wish I could say that again I feel like saying it again you don't have to worry you're worried about your kids you're worried about your church you're worried about your job you don't have to worry this is all temporary anyway I know that when I'm gone my kids are going with me I don't care what the devil tries to make them look like well the devil the devil's taking my kids out it don't matter keep that Faith over them keep that token over them they're coming back that's the faith you got to have and if the spirit of Christ is in you you may get discouraged at the grave of Lazarus when it looks like your best friend's died and you may not be able to call a man back that's been dead four days but see the difference is that body that he raised was just to show you that when you go down and your body is in corruption the very same Spirit that's in you will Quicken that body again a prophet don't have to come and raise me from the dead because the quickening power is already here the word is already here I've ate the book the word is in me and when that morning comes should I go by way of the Grave I'll be the first to get up why because on that great Resurrection morning morning that there's going to be something on the inside of the Bride I don't care how long they've been laying there there's going to be a voice of Resurrection that's going to raise them from the dead oh you can't keep a bride in the ground you can't keep us in the ground you well you can't keep us dead you can't keep us quiet because we know who we are I tell you what death can't defeat you death can't take you out well my grandparents went by I don't care what I don't care who died they ain't dead a Christian cannot die because this power is on the inside of you and this power cannot die I'm bringing it down but look look what Jesus says here Jesus said no man can come to me except my father has draw him and all that my father hath given me they will come they will that's right we don't have to worry about them they will my sheep my doves they hear my voice a stranger they will not follow and what is the voice of God is the word of God so when your pastor is standing behind this pulpit and reading and preaching under the anointing the word of God that is the voice of God to you oh that's hard just why that's what a prophet said what is the voice of God the word of God so if I'm reading this Bible that is the voice of God to you if I'm reading the quotes of the message of the hour that is the voice of God to you if God would come down here tonight and say that you're healed you are that is the voice of God to you that's not something I said he already said it and I'm just here to say what he said I'm not just a parent but it's been Quicken to me I know it's right I know it's real I know the word of God is right and there's nothing in this nothing in this world can stop me from receiving the prize at the end of the race sir here's a distraction there's a distraction here's something over here oh here's some there's going to be drama come up around you oh it's going to try to stop you but the bride of Christ will run with patience they won't stop why because they have authority to overlook that distraction and Overlook that distraction and Overlook that trouble why yes it's a trouble yes you may have something in your road that looks like a roadblock but you've been given the key to possess the Rapture by the authority of the voice of God in you you recognize who you are and all devils in hell can't stop you you recognize who you are and it's time for body change you recognize who you are I tell you what we don't need to know who anybody else is know who you are well it's brother Joel this or his brother no you don't worry about me worry about who you are I don't have to worry about brother Matt or brother Mark listen these are men of God I can say that but listen you know what I can fail you men can fail you and often times will yeah but but listen the word that he's speaking won't fail if he's speaking the word of God and you know the voice of God why because you've I believe brother Andrew said this and I don't mean to quote him but you familiarized yourself with the word of God so you know when the word of God's being preached that's why we we ain't trying to take tapes out of your home you need to be hearing the tapes we ain't trying to take the Bibles out of your homes you need to be reading the Bibles you need to do it now more than ever it's your food it's your daily bread it's what you need it's everything to you but when you come to the house of God don't come with a critical spirit that says well I I don't know that really brother Brandon meant it that way if I read a quote to you out of the message I tell you what I may not understand it either but if he said it I'm going to stake my soul on it because I believe the word of God and I don't have time to pick and choose what I what I want to believe I just want to believe what he said and well God help me if if that if that's wrong God forgive me for a Vindicated Prophet if that's wrong to believe the Bible God forgive me for believing a Vindicated word in our hour but I say God will back us up at the day God will back us up at that day when you stand there and there's been many go before you and I'll tell you what there's been many went on a different ages and they were longing to be in the age you're in because you have you will never taste death you will see I tell you what you'll see your loved ones coming in what a supernatural time that is coming for the bride and I believe we're entering in there right now we don't have to give up hope on our loved ones I don't care how far gone they look I don't care how bad they look I say hold on to the faith that God has given you speak the word over your children speak the word over your sickness speak the word because in you is the potential to speak the voice of God because you can speak and Devils will tremble because it's not you speaking it's not you speaking it's the voice of God if if it was just your voice voice the devil wouldn't be scared a bit I can I can say boo devil but if that's just me but he knows there's something on the inside of me that means it he knows that I'm not going to take a backseat to what the devil has I tell you what some of you some Of You' been out in the world some of you know how bad it can get some of you know how far in sin you can get because you've let down your guard and you just drift and you drift and you drift that's right and then when you come back you get on fire the Lord and then after a while the devil says well wasn't you know you it wasn't really that bad out there it wasn't really that miserable out there he wants to get you right back in that miserable pit you were already in but did you know what that's the time to kick that devil in the teeth that's the time to get in church and say you know what I'm going to shout a little extra just so the devil knows whose side I'm on I feel cold I feel like the spirit has Departed getting church and I tell you what devil you may have me held back from receiving my full potential in this service but I'm going to praise God anyway it's not what I deserve but he deserves the glory he deserves the honor he deserves my praise I I tell you what I don't have to feel like praising him to praise him because he gave me authority to speak over my life over my family can I have five minutes brother random says this and it's in a prayer but I'll just read it to you he talks about Moses he said he said oh God how I could think when the church was on the move when Moses got a little scared down there at the Red Sea he be to cry to the Lord and the Lord said why are you crying to me what are you crying to me for speak and go forward why cry why worry speak because you have the words in your mouth that's right you ate the book you have the words of eternal life coming out of your mouth oh you don't I tell you what we just got to know who we are church we just got to know that we're not in this alone that when we speak we're speaking like the Oracles of God we we are speaking as God why listen because we are the body we don't make up I don't make up the entire body but if you get rid of me then the body's missing a piece I may be the most insignificant piece of the body but I'm still part of the body and I'm GNA claim that until the day I die I'm going to claim that until the body change why because I'm not going to take what the devil tells me you ain't you know you're not you don't deserve to be up there I know I'm I know I'm not worthy but I know who is worthy and his blood has covered me brother said Lord God today I come in the name of the Lord Jesus I come yielding this sword of Faith claiming the Oneness of God and man by the Holy Ghost that's my point I want to get to you tonight he's claiming you he's claiming you to to be one with God through the baptism of the Holy Ghost if you don't have it then you're never going to be one with God tonight's your night if you need it tonight's your night you don't have to wait till the next Revival oh come on church when your pastor standing here that's just as good a time to receive the Holy Ghost as the meeting you have at the end of the year I tell you what he has just as much authority to speak over you as any man that he would call into in this Pulpit I know that I listen I'm not bragging on us I'm not bragging on us for speaking I'm bragging on him because it's his voice speaking through a body I'm not saying that I am God but I have the attributes in me of God I know I have the flesh too if you're looking at this you're looking at the wrong thing if you're looking at this you're looking at failures and mistakes you're looking at someone who who could fail you tomorrow but on the inside of me is the Holy Ghost that is going to hold me because I've been sealed I've been sealed to the day of my Redemption nothing can stop me [Applause] now brother brandom

come from God that means any Authority that the devil thinks he has it came from God first and he gave you the authority over all things a't that wonderful how many say praise the Lord tonight man I know appreciate our brother coming and pouring his heart out to the Lord I know God spoke to many hearts tonight I know you y'all think it's funny when pastors say this but many conversations that I've had that brother repeated things that you talk to people about and I know he made a statement don't let the devil use that he made a statement where he said I told you I was going to read something the church CH book don't take that and think he was telling me about his message or I was talking to him I never talk one word to him we were sitting in the back and I said something about our church and how that we love the church age book where we you know the church when we first started we went through the church age book A lot it was a lot of teaching he said well I have a quote in the church age book tonight I'm glad to know somebody's okay to read it that's why he said that so he didn't sit back there and tell me that and I certainly didn't sit back here and talk to him but the Lord spoke to our hearts tonight he used our brother a surrendered vessel as an authority of the word of God over our Liv Liv to tell you keep pressing the battle God's got it all in control God put us in our place he gave every one of us our position and some seemed great and some seem lesser how many remember me preaching that the other day but he made the he made more valuable the ones that seem less desirable gave them more value that's what God says to us tonight isn't it wonderful we all have a place in the the word of God it's sure good to have sister Lillian back been sick I'm glad to see her feeling better amen amen you love the Lord tonight amen we'll just bow our heads together if there's anything in your heart now just let it go tonight what an atmosphere to go home and

that it would have been an encouragement to every heart Lord every person that's going through things they may some look at others trials and say they're great trials and mine are little and there's a little or Min or great but God and all of us are facing things and Lord we ask you Lord that God through the moving of your spirit Lord that all things are made fresh here today God if there's
