article and it said the Sanhedrin have made a announcement and it said that all the Jews need to come back to Israel immediately and it kind of quickened me because you know the prophet says watch Israel whenever whatever God's doing with Israel he's going to do with the church and it said in that article they the the Sanhedrin and the council they told the people whatever you got to do get home it's it's pertinent it's important that you get home to Israel now and he says whatever you got to do he says if you got to sell some stuff to get over here he say if you got to leave jobs he says whatever you got to do just get over here to Israel now because you only can be protected in Israel and that stirred my heart cuz Saints we're getting ready to leave this world and I think it's

made there is still a God that can take all the broken pieces all the broken mistakes bring it together and and bring forth a masterpiece of his grace and that is just a wonderful thing about our God Amen if you would have your Bibles let's open our scriptures to job 23 and 1 I have a simple thought tonight but I pray it can it can come together and strengthen and and edify in some way and if I would have a subject it would be stable in the will of God and these are just some things I I've been been studying going and it's been an encouragement to me being being stabilized and so I pray it can it can help you as well tonight but there in job 23 And1 The Bible would say then job answered and said even to today is my complaint bitter my stroke is heavier than my my groaning oh that I knew where I might find him that I might come even to his seat I would order my cause before him and fill my mouth with arguments I would know the words which he would answer me and understand what he would say unto me will he plead against me with his great power no but he would put strength in me there there the righteous might dispute with him so should I be delivered from Ever from my judge behold I go forward but he is not there backward but I cannot perceive him on the left hand where he doth work but I cannot Behold Him He hideth himself on the right hand that I cannot see him but he knoweth the way that I take and when he ha tried me I shall come forth as gold my foot hath held his steps his way have I kept and not declined neither have I gone back from the Commandment of his lips I have esteemed the words of his mouth more than my necessary food but he is in one mind who can turn him and what his soul desireth even that he doeth for he performeth the thing that is appointed for me and many such things are with Him amen can we bow our heads tonight de gracious Heavenly Father Lord how humbled we are to come into your presence father as we feel you near us tonight Lord God I ask that you would anoint the speaker and the hearer tonight Lord God I ask that you would help me to lab myself aside father and as the word would come forth Lord May It Be Inspired Lord and God as the congregation would hear the words father may they receive it into their hearts Lord whatever the need is God I believe you're still the the need maker Lord the meter of every need father I ask that you would just come among us tonight Lord and and speak to the hearts Lord and to the needs God lord we lay the service into your hands in Jesus Christ's name amen you may be seated and un stable in the will of God and and I want to start out by reading a quote and perseverance brother Brandon would say that's what we do what what we must do you must find first find the will of God before you can do the will of God you must first know what his will is in the matter and then don't turn it loose as the lady said today as she was trying to get beyond the sound barrier and then the plane just picks up the speed and goes at on and limited when it passes the sound barrier well when you pray until you pass that doubt barrier then you're running free and you can go on and there's nothing can bother you then because you're running free you're past unbelief it's done it's been settled it's all over when you get Assurance in your heart that it's going to be that way you're just as happy as if it has already happened so once you get the Assurance in your heart that something is going to be a certain way then you can be as happy now as if though it's already taken place and and we would see that you must fire first find the will of God before you can do the will of God then brother Brandon would tell us then don't turn it loose because many people they they think they find the will of God but the first time they come up against a an opposition or an obstacle well maybe maybe we miss we misheard or or maybe we we we didn't find the will of God you see what that is is the devil coming and trying to pressure you away from what God has for your life you see the very opposition is a sign that you're in the will of God many times cuz brother Brandon would tell us that cloudy skies and and and and and dark clouds above your mind is not a sign of God's disapproval or is the bright skies and sunny days a sign of his approval you see so many times the devil like likes to put question marks in our mind when we come up against something oh maybe I done something wrong maybe maybe I made a mistake here maybe maybe we made the wrong choice here that ain't the time to give up in the will of God that is the time to keep pressing on and we would see that Jesus would be a prime example of following the will of God he would say I do nothing till I see my father do it you know I seek not my own will but the will of the father and and it would be pretty incredible how much Faith Jesus would have to have to accomplish the will of the father CU we would see that he would agonize there in the Garden of Gethsemane and and would would say if it's possible let this cup pass from me he knew what it would take to accomplish the will of God for his life he had to be beaten he had to be crucified his beard had to be plucked out it was already prophesied by David that all of these things would take place and yet he would say nevertheless not my will but thy will be done he was so persuaded of the will of God for his life he was willing to endure and you see are we persuaded enough for the will of God for our lives that we can endure you see many times we turn around in the will of God because we're not persuaded that it is the will of God but if you find that this message is the will of God for your life then you are persuaded and there's nothing that could separate you from the will of God and we would see and I love job's confession he would say you know job 23:11 my foot hath held his steps his way have I kept and not declined neither have I gone back from the Commandments of his lips I have esteemed the words of his mouth more than his necessary food and my my necessary food and job knew what he was doing was the will of God he knew he wasn't a secret sinner he knew he he wasn't he wasn't mistaken on where he was and brother Brandon would say he knew that he was just even whenever his friends were saying he was a secret sinner he knew he was was just because he was in the will of God by by performing a a burnt sacrifice so he knew that the sacrifice had made him perfect and so the will of God that he was in was greater than the accusations that was coming against him and many times we have accusations coming against us how we're doing this wrong we're doing that wrong you made the wrong mistake but if you're in the will of God that will is greater than any accusation that comes against and I believe that is something we all have to find for our lives is what is the will of God for my life because if you don't find it anything is going to turn you away and brother Brandon was said so many times we get to a place where we can't stand still and nervous and and just as we start to do something good then we see trouble coming but that is the devil trying to accept the program of God we find in our individual lives in the church world and National Affairs you find it everywhere and then we then we can know that when we're ready ready to do right wrong is always present but the way to overcome that is to than in your heart which way God would have you to go which is the best way and stay with that way and so brother Brandon was letting us know when we start to do something for God evil is always going to be present to turn you around but then I love it he G gives us the secret how to overcome this find Which Way in your heart to go then you stick with it you see this ain't the time to turn around and say devil you won this ain't the time to turn around and say circumstances you won this is the time to find an anchor for the heart and keep pressing on and be stable in what God has done for us in this generation and I believe if that the people would find the will of God for their lives there would be more people stable you know there would be more people that that that wasn't backbiting cure talking about that one you know there wouldn't be as many insecurities and complexes cuz if you find who you are where you're going what you're doing you get stable you don't care what that one's doing how great of a job that one is doing how much this one's going how how that one's prospering what about you it don't matter about that one it don't matter about your neighbor it don't matter about the preacher what are you doing for the Lord what is the will of God for your life you see young people can be so stable in the will of God that when the devil does come with insecurities you say oh no devil I'm stable on what God has chosen me to do you see you might not be called to be a preacher but if you're called to be in a manner be stable in that if go maybe God hasn't called you to be a deacon but if God has called you to be a husband be stable in what God has called you to do cuz that's where the blessings of God are going to fall is where God has called you to be you see if you get out of your position the blessings of God are not going to fall in your life but if you stay where God has placed you and where God has called you to be that's where the blessings of God are going to fall you remember the missionary that that felt led to go to Africa I believe and he would come before the missionary board and would say I feel led to do this and take my family with me and the board would say there's no way you know they have that AR is over there they have this illness over there that this disease you're taking your family with you they would say you're crazy and what would the missionary say he says well God has told me to go and we're safer there than we are here he had found the will of God for his life and he knew it did not matter the opposition that came against him he was stable and what God had chose him to do oh little church tonight we can be so stable in what God has chose us to do that when the storms come it does not bother us when circumstance come it does not bother us cuz we're stabilized oh Hallelujah that's why we can't be ruled by emotions if you're walking by your emotions you're never stable so you can be up today down tomorrow and then you never know what the will of God is you know if you're walking by emotions whenever you're up on a spiritual High man the Lord is with me but what about tomorrow when you don't got the emotions when you don't feel like a Christian where's your stability at I don't believe your stability is in emotions your stability is in the will of God that has been delivered in this generation oh you may say what are you talking about brother Josh I believe this a message has showed us what we are to be in this generation you might not be a preacher but you might be a prayer Warrior and it lets you know wherever you are abide in the calling that God has put inside of your life oh Hallelujah and we would see that with the missionary had made no sense with the missionary board that he was to go but he found the will of God and it might not make sense the direction that you're going to many people but if it is the will of God stick with him and we would see that it was the will of God for Jesus you know to rise up upon the third day and we would and we would look at the story and how he was dead for three days corruption was about to come and and everything like that but it was already prophesied that he was to raise up again and what is so incredible that it was already prophesied that not one bone would be broken in Jesus body right and here would come the soldiers when he was upon the cross they would break the would break this thief's leg they would break this one's leg but then they would come to Jesus and could not break his leg but then they would stab him with a spear right because it was already prophesied the will of God was for none of his bones to be broken so that is the authority of the will of God over every one of our Lives if we just submit oursel to what God has chosen us to do no weapon formed against you shall prosper that's where the blessings of God are oh Hallelujah that's where the blessings of God are is where God has chosen you to be and we would see that job was constantly pointing to the will of God you know there in job 23:10 but he knoweth the way that I take and when he have tried me I shall come forth has gold here all hell was turned loose upon job and all he would say was he knoweth the way that I take you see what stability is he did he have there he knoweth the way that I take and he would say when he had tried me and what I love about job's confession is is when he had tried me I shall come forth as gold and so while he was sitting there in the fire his eyes wasn't upon the fire his eyes was upon the finished Pro what is this fire going to do for me you see I don't believe we go through trials without it being appointed for us we go through things and it's leading us to the the the the purpose of God that he has for our life and here job was saying when I am tried I shall come forth has gold he was looking at the will of God and that nothing happens by accident he would say in job 23 and4 for he performeth the thing that is appointed for me he performthe would know that he was not on Earth by accident but he was on Earth for an appointed season for a very a specific reason and he performthe appointed thing for me and that is something we can all take courage in that we're not here by accident and if we are here we are here to perform a special task and we're not the one performing it he's the one performing him we're just surrendering oursel to what God has called us to be and he is the one performing the miracle in every one of our Lives oh Hallelujah and you know and here here Hebrews 10:36 the Apostle Paul would say for ye have need of patience that after you have done the will of God you might receive the promise so it was after sticking with the will of God that the promise can be fulfilled oh and every one of us has promises concerning our lives but how do we achieve those promises by sticking with the will of God you see many times it looks glamorous looking across the road and brother the brandom would tell us the grass is always greener on the other side of the fence right it's always easier sitting here and looking over there saying man I wish I was there that's where God is oh man this is taking place over here that one's taking place over there and you're failing to see this if this is where God has placed you this is is where your promise is this is where your inheritance is this is where your stability is if this is where God has placed you oh Hallelujah and you see the the the Bible would say in 1 Thessalonians 3 and 2 and S timoth this our brother and minister of God our fellow labor in the gospel of Christ to establish you and to comfort you concerning your faith that no man should be moved by these afflictions for yourselves know that we are appointed there unto to establish you what were they establishing this church in the will of God they were bringing the gospel of Christ and saying this is going to establish you and comfort your faith oh and and can you imagine maybe maybe some of these church members had been going through a hard time maybe they had been hitting stone wall at the stone wall they don't feel like God's answering their prayers then all of a sudden here comes a preacher saying I'm coming with the gospel of Christ to comfort your faith and maybe your faith feels a little bit weak this evening maybe you've gone through some trials this week you don't know if you can take another step but let me Comfort your faith that there is a will for everyone of your lives and only one person can perform that will and that is you your neighbor can accomplish the will your sister can accomplish the will only you can accomplish the will of God for your life Hallelujah and that no man should be moved by these afflictions oh ain't that ain't that powerful no man should be moved and so the Apostle Paul wasn't saying that that that that the strengthening of your faith was going to keep the afflictions away but he was saying when the afflictions come you shall not be moved by it the Apostle Paul would say in one place none of these things moved me but the brand would say he was harnessed to the will of God but the Apostle Paul would say I was not disobedient to the heavenly vision how come he was not disobedient to it he was tied to it you see if if you're tied to something you can only do the will of the one you're tied to right you remember whenever Jesus would tell the disciples go into the City and you're going to find a donkey right and he's going to be tied up and if anybody asks you what is the purpose of it tell him I sent you and go untie it and you would notice that before the donkey could perform the will of Jesus it to be untied so in other words if you're tied to something you cannot perform another task and if you're tied to the will of God the devil can come with his will with his purpose with his goals and achievements but if you are tied to the will of God there's no Direction you're going to go but the path of God that he has for your life and let me say this evening be harnessed to the will of God that no matter what comes against you nothing moves me the Apostle Paul would say it none of these things moved me I'm harnessed to one thing that is the will of God oh Hallelujah you see if you're tied to something you can't be led to another direction and you would see that the Apostle Paul would say who shall separate us from the love of God and that is a powerful statement because he would continue on and would say your tribulation or distress or persecution or famine or nness Pearl or sword as it is written for thy sake we are killed all the day long we are counted as sheep for the slaughter nay in all of these things we are more than conquerors through him that loved us and so here the Apostle Paul would say nothing shall separate us from the love of God so the very thing he was tied to nothing could separate him from and what is so powerful and then he would say we're more than conquerors through him that loved us so the very thing he was tied to was strengthening him to go through the persecutions he was going through oh and the will of God for your life once you're tied to it nothing can separate you from it and that is the very strength that you need to go through the hard times that you go through oh we see if if you know the will of God for your life is a Rapture there's nothing that the doubts can do to keep you out of it you're tied to it right and so that is the very strength that you need to press on you see if you knew you know if you had a vision that that that you're going to go on a trip tomorrow and you almost get in a wreck you know and you know that you don't get in the wreck that that God keeps you from keeps you from getting in the accident when you're driving down the road you may know that there's going to be almost a collision take place but God already showed you that you're going to make it through it what was like the Apostle Paul whenever the Lord would tell him he was to stand before the king of Gus I believe and when they were in the Shipwreck everybody thought they were going to die the Apostle Paul says not no not one man is going to die if you stick with the ship right in other words if you stay in the will of God your life is going to be spared how come he knew that he was going to survive God already showed him he was to stand before the king of gpus and let me tell you this God has showed us in this generation when the prophet went beyond the curtain of time he would say I saw you there that is a stability we can anchor in our life that no matter what we go through there's already a vision concerning my life oh Hallelujah you see we're not walking by emotions we're walking by a vision that God has given us in this generation but we would see that that if you if you if you if you find the will of God for your life then there's a risk that that we can abide him and brother Brandon would tell us excuse me he would say the great miracle of Noah's day was Noah being tucked away in the ark when the rain fell ain't that a that a powerful thing the great miracle wasn't necessarily the boat the great miracle was Noah being tucked away in the boat you know him having enough confidence in what God showed him that he could rest he could be he he could be stabilized when the rain start to fall that's what the great great miracle was was Noah resting in the ark and that is the greatest miracle today is people being able to rest we're living in the day where man people are out of their minds there's anxieties complexes insecurities it's the greatest battle ever fought but there are Miracles taking place there are people resting in the will of God for their life you know brother the Brandon would tell us that the a Christian experience or the Christian experence erience is based solemnly upon rest he says you're tossed to and fro until you come to Christ and then he says then it's all finished we're resting in Christ and so we're tossed to and fro until we are until we come to Christ then we are resting and you see this ain't the time to tuck tail and run this is the time to stand where God has placed us you know and brother Brandon would say in one place when you find the will of God he said says don't let nobody talk you out of the will of God he would say would talk about balam and would say balam would know the will of God but then would let the king talk him out of him so it ain't that this ain't time to be talked out of the will of God for our lives you know brother Brandon would talk about George Washington and would say George Washington would stay on his knees till he found the will of God he would sit there we know the famous painting of him in the snow he says he stayed there in snow all the way up to his waste and so he got an answer from God that he was to be Victorious and so whenever he got up off his knees he was walking by a vision then he knew that God already promised him the victory so when he went across that River and bullets were going through his coold he had a promise that he was in the will of God so it did not matter the opposition that was coming against him he was in the will of God and if you find it don't let nobody talk you out of it for your life Hallelujah and we would see that Paul the Apostle Paul would say prove all things and hold fast to them which is good so don't hold fast to everything but prove it you see you want to find the will of God for your life make sure it lines up with scripture come on now make sure it lines up with the message of the hour you see I'm not one that believes well I'm not one that believes if God tells you something and it don't line up with the scripture is it from God come on now you got to make sure the will of God that is coming to you is from God the Apostle Paul would say if an angel if me if anybody else comes and tells you anything than what I've already told you right let him be a curse don't listen to it so before you know the will of God you got to make sure it lines up with the scripture with the message of the hour prove all things then hold fast to them which is good so if you proven that you have the will of God hold fast to it don't let go of it when the first win comes when the first credit comes but hold fast to it and say this is where God has placed me oh Hallelujah you see brother the Brandon going talk about Jehoshaphat and the nation of Judah and would say Jehoshaphat was a righteous man and you know he would say that he was serving the lord by the best of his ability he was doing the best that he knew to do and what would happen the moabites would come against the nation of Judah right and but the Brandon would tell us that the people were all afraid they were in TMO they were running every different direction and then the Lord would speak to Jehoshaphat and would say stand still right and see the salvation of the Lord and you know what brother Brandon would say brother Brandon would say as long as they were together and praying it was God's battle ain't that powerful as long as they were together you see whenever troubles come come to the church that ain't time to be divided oh I'm preaching now whenever tribulation comes against the church whenever trials comes and and turmoils come that ain't the time to TU tuck tail and stay home from church and and stay home and andore phone calls and ignore text that is the time to come together so God can fight the battle as long as you're divided you're trying to fight it and you're not going to get Victory but this ain't the time to be divided let Trials come let WI blow against this church but if this is the will of God for you to be here come together in one Accord and let the fire of God fall like never before it was the 120 that was in the upper room in one Accord come on now in one Accord and that's when the Revival fell down you want to see a Revival like never before get rid of all the division get rid of all the backbiting get rid of all the naysaying get rid of all the gossip sessions and come together in one Accord One Vision one motive that is the will of God and you'll see the blessings of God fall like never before you see I'm not one that believes that that that God starts something and just leaves it if God started this assembly he's going to be faithful to complete it all the way to the coming of the Lord I don't believe God has done with this assembly I don't believe God has done with the families that in this assembly I don't believe God is done with those Ministries if God has placed you here God is going to continue to bless the will for this church but he needs some people that's stable in it come on he need somebody that says wow this is where you placed me I'm going to be stabilized it don't matter what comes and goes what what that one says this is where the blessings are for me it might not be for you but it is for me right oh you see that's what our confession should be if somebody comes up to you and says you know what this one says I your church believes this way you know this one says this well it might not be for you but it's for me yes sir it might not be feeding you but I'm sure it's feeding me anyways that was free but you see it's troubles that is trying to break up the will of God but God would tell Jehosaphat stand still stand still quit running to and fro stand still then you'll see the salvation of the Lord and you would see that it's fear many times it's fear that tries to break up the will of God you know brother brandom would talk about Peter and would say when he walked upon the Water to Jesus brother brandom says he walked on substance right and you know what's so incredible is what would Peter first say he would look out and would say Jesus if that is you bid me to come right so Peter wanted to make sure it was Jesus called in him right cuz that really spoke to my heart because could you imagine being Peter if that wasn't Jesus you're going to walk out and go boom right but if it is Jesus and he is calling me the Supernatural is going to be there you see that's why it's so important to make sure you're following the will of God because you're going to be like Peter if it ain't the will of God you're going to step out and sink right you're going to go through a drown you know any and what is so incredible is brother brandom says he was walking on substance and he says his substance would have led him straight to Jesus but what happened fear ain't been incredible that he started to look at the waves and as he looked at the waves but the brandom says what he feared Came Upon him so as he started to doubt what Jesus told him to do he lost the very substance oh you know what brother Brandon would say brother Brandon would say he professed his faith but had no substance that's where the church world is at today everybody's Christians everybody believes in a God but where's the substance where where's the reality of the Gospel where's the reality of this message we don't want professors we want somebody that's got substance and the only way you can have substance is in the will of God brother Brandon which would quote job and job would say what I have feared had has come upon me and so fear tries to take you out of the will of God you know and many times the Devil comes with fear and says you have to fear God how many's ever heard that I've heard it you you you're afraid if you make a mistake well God's not going to forgive me if you if you stumble and fall you're going to send your day of Grace away that's fear and you know there's a difference between the fear of the Lord and the fear of Satan because the Bible says we got to fear the lord and brother Brandon would tell us that the fear of the Lord is not being afraid of God it's reverencing God so there's a difference between being afraid and the fear of God you see the Devil comes with fear to get you to be afraid that when you do make a mistake you you you you don't think you God can pick you up you know you make a mistake and instead of turning to God for forgiveness you go the other direction right and what that does is that takes away your substance and you can't fight the Devil Without substance fa is the substance the evidence of Things Not Seen and so without substance how are you going to overcome the devil come on now you see if I was scared of Mark and I was afraid that he can whip me and we got into an argument and things started to get heated and I knew he could take me I'm going to back down right if I knew he was about to whip me if I said another thing I'm going to back down you win and that's what happens many times in the house of God we we lose our substance because of fear and whenever spirits come against the home we've got no strength to push it back so we step back and let this come in we step back and let that come in we step back we allow spirits to come into our home we allow spirits to come into our family we allow spirits to come into the church but this ain't time to be governed by by fear this is the time to grab faith in the will of God and see every Spirit has no right in my home has no right in my mind has no rights in my family in this church oh this ain't the time to give up and give in and play dead with the devil and say come on in this is the time to say greater is he that is in me we're more than conquerors through him that loves us I'm not backing down I'm standing forward oh you remember the dream of the preacher would have right and he was in this tram there would come a devil and he would say boo and he would jump back he would get smaller the devil would get bigger right and this happened Time After Time After Time and he would find a Bible I believe and would grab the Bible and would say boo the devil jumped back and got smaller he got bigger right you see it's time that we throw out the the the the defensive mindset of just if I step back you have a little bit of ground I step back you have a little bit of ground and that's not the way it works it's time to grab the will of God and say if God placed me here this is where the blessings are boo devil boo pornography boo boo blasphemy blue blue iniquity boo these things that comes against me oh Hallelujah you see too many times we don't realize how much Authority God has given us you know that we don't realize it you know brother Brandon would talk about how that uh a husband would die okay he would he would die in a house and his wife brother brand a little old FR thing would say I'm a standing for that and what she would do she would jump on top of him and would start the pray and said I give his life back but the brandom says well it wasn't his time to go then he says the life come back to that man but what was it it was a little old woman that says I'm not standing for it we need some more mama like that we need some more daddies like that that says I'm not standing for Spirits they're are coming inside of my home well I preach you now I'm not standing for spirits that are going to try to take my babies try to take my teenagers try to take my marriage try to take my church I'm not standing for it I'm going to stand against it and resist the devil and he shall flee we need some people that's stabilized in the will of God there say's no weapon and formed against me shall prosper back up devil I'm not standing for it Hallelujah I'm not standing for it glory to God and so what's so incredible is brother Brandon would say the greatest thing that I find against the church tonight is fear everybody scared to death about something what are you scared about if a man's born again he should be happy Carefree oh man if he's born again he should be happy and carefree not not not chain down to the world not trained down to emotions but Carefree here we continue on to say just like these fellas up there singing and brother the brother testifying back there just free there ain't nothing can harm you nothing present nothing future nothing can separate us from the love of God that is in Christ God has promised us it you see why why do we have to be afraid we don't got to be afraid when things come against us and you know what what another thing that that fear does Fear takes away H the personal effect of the message fear would say that yeah the message might be true but it's not for you right how many's ever heard that that's a young person I heard all the time the devil telling me and it really comes into families whenever you're a pastor son or a pastor daughter or a Deacon's child cuz you hear you you see the anointing in your family right you see man I've got I got two uncles that are pastors my grandpa was a pastor my dad's a pastor so I'm sitting here looking at the anointing flowing through all of these individuals then I make a mistake and I'm sitting there thinking man why why can't I do that why can't I achieve that why can't I why can't I do something like that it was fear and that fear was making the message through them but it can't work through me oh come on now you see brother brandom would would tell a story and and and the story would line up with with the niagar Falls story and you remember niagar Falls there was a man that would put a rope across the across STP and would walk across it youall remember that story remember that event and then the story would go that he would ask the people do you think that I can walk across this rope and come back they would all say yeah you can do it okay he would do it and they and they would say that he would actually get a stove and would fry an egg on the stove while walking across the Rope across nowar Falls ain't that incredible and everybody believed he can do it he would come back get a whe Barrel you think I can push it across oh yeah you can do it go across come back do you think I can push a person in the wheelbarrow oh yeah you can do it and they said he said okay then get in everybody says oh no they believed there could be done until it came to the end that's where the devil wants to put you with fear it can be done but not through you it's time to cast down the spirit of fear and grab a hold of the will of God in this generation and say devil not by might not by power but by my spirit saith the Lord I can't do it but the will of God is greater but the BR say in the church and you in the church you sitting here tonight oh you're struggling and struggling God's app pulling to you and showing you things if you could ever get past the sin barrier of unbelief then unlimited Revival would break out through the United States and everywhere if you can go beyond the sound barrier that the sin barrier of unbelief oh is it true does it mean me can I be healed could I be saved could I get filled with the Holy Ghost he says get Beyond want that ain't that incredible that's what feared does it can't happen to you can I be saved can I be filled with the Holy Ghost but brother brandom says once you get beyond that unlimited Revival will break out across the states but I don't believe it's going to break across the states because brother Brandon would tell us America's under judgment but the bride she's she America has missed the Awakening of the Bride but you are in the bride's Revival and so once you get past is the Bri's Revival for me then you can break into an unlimited Revival oh you can break through it you know brother the brandom would say in one place that before the before the the airplane gets past the sound barrier it says the boats feel like it's going to fall out he says the wings feel like it's going to fall out it feels like it's going to fall apart but you know what brother brandom says once it gets past its own sound then it runs at ease its own sound come on now that's where many of us fa with fear is our own sound our own insecurities our own mistakes our own failures and that sound is pushing us back from the Revival that God has for us cast out the Fear cast out your own sounds cast it out and break through into the Eternal Realms that God has for you you got to break through your own sound though what does that mean those insecurity those voices that comes and says you're not good enough you'll never amount to anything you're not worthy of it you're right you're not worthy of it but God Made You worthy of it come on now God Made You worthy God blessed you it wasn't God wasn't Mary saying God you got to choose me and I'm going to be the Virgin it was God that chose her it was the angel that says you're highly favored you're blessed among women it was it was God coming to her and revealing to her his will then all she had to do was be stable in it how should it be I know not no man and what is so incredible is the message of Gabriel had all the answers here she would say how would this be I know not no man then the message would say the Holy Ghost is going to overshadow you you don't have to do anything why would she say be it unto me according to Thy word thy will hallelujah it's not you trying to perform it you're surrendering yourself to what God's given you Hallelujah and you sh with the brown I'm going tell us the biggest curse on people is the fear he says God has given you he made the provision for everything you have need of but you're afraid to take him out's word and what's so incredible you remember Elijah and I won't hold you too very long tonight but you remember Elijah here Elijah was was going through some things he was there up in in the cave right and and why would he say he would he would be complaining to God and would say God they have tore down your altars right they have killed all of your prophets I'm the only one that is left and what's incredible is he's complaining to God and what would God say there's still 7,000 that has not bow their knee to bail here he was sitting in a state I'm by myself nobody understands I'm not going to make it there's no Supernatural here and your God is said what you talking about man I still got a Remnant I still got 7,000 that is still stabilized and the devil likes to come and says this one's falling away that one's falling away that one's doubting this one's doing this let them do what they want to if they want to go out there and paint the town red let them do it but it's for me in my house I'm going to serve the Lord Elijah is saying I'm by myself but God says what are you looking at I'm looking at the bigger purpose you got to look at the will of God for your life quit looking at what's around you quit looking at the situations and look at the way God's looking at it the way Elijah was looking at it was different than the way God was looking at him you remember Gideon the Bible says an angel would come to Gideon and would say you're a mighty man of Valor you remember that and what would Gideon say I'm based in my father's house and my father's house is poor right and what does what is the definition of the word Valor is wealthy so here comes an angel from God saying you're a mighty man of wealth and he looks and says I'm poor I'm the least in my father's house he was looking at himself differently than the way God was looking at him you got to look at yourself the way God sees you God don't look at you as a tribulation Saint God looks at you as his bride God don't look at you as serpent seed he looks at you as his bride so you got to change your perspective in the way God looks at you come on now you remember brother brownon would say the the the Pharaoh would look out the window and would see mud dobers would see slaves right and he says Moses looked at it and seen a victory he seen a promise they were looking at the same things but different perspectives come on sometimes we got to change the way we look at things come on the situation that you think is going to take you down has no authority over you unless you give it to it come on now you see there's a rest that we can be in you see and brother Brandon would tell us that we're Triune being right and what is so incredible is brother brownon would talk about job and would say that job was a man of inspiration and this really spoke to me as a preacher and I know everybody can relate to this he would say that job was a man of inspiration and he would see everybody would come to job and ask job what is the will of God for my life what what does the Lord want to say to me every time they needed an answer they came to job but what would happen while he's on his Ash sheep but the brandom says he had no inspiration ain't that just just just it it it really it really done something to me but the Brandon then would say that the Vindication that Noah or that Jo job was a servant of God was his inspiration so here he is sitting a man of God being used but now the Chanel of God is working through him closes up could you imagine the Mind battles right God's working through me here and God's a it's a powerful Ministry a powerful gift a powerful thing all of a sudden it closes up and you're sitting there all by yourself you get no answer from God but the brandom says that all those friends that would come to him for inspiration all left him so now everybody that came to him because of his gift is now gone and he's sitting there and brother Brandon would say this and man this really struck me he would say he wanted to see if there was somebody who could intercede for him he had interceded for so many people but now is there somebody that could speak for him could there be somebody put his hand on job a sinful man and a holy God and make a bridge the way could he go to his house and knock on the door would he open the door and talk a minute ain't that that the agony of job and the the Bible would tell us that job was looking for God oh if I could just find God I I would sit down and talk with him I would relay my heart if I could just find him but the brandom says he's wanting somebody to intercede for him and man that hit me between the eyes as a minister you know what youall know what it's like whenever you get behind the pull pit you there's there's an anointing you're breaking away for people to get Victory you you're breaking channels open you see Victory falling but but then all of a sudden you go home and the anointing wears off the anointing goes off of you you're laying in your bed saying my goodness what did I do wrong here the spirits come against your mind here you just made a way for somebody else but now you can't get a breakthrough mothers feel that way when you you you're the one that does the laundry for the children cook supper for for the family you're making sure the house is cleaned and prepared but who's going to intercede for you right daddy you go to work you you you you make sure there's food on the table you make sure there's gas in the cars you make sure there's electricity in the home but what about you who's going to intercede for you and here's where here's where job was if I could just find him if I could just find him I would relay my heart oh man and that really hit me if we could just find him we get to that place many times that's when you need to know you're in the will of God when you can't see him when you can't hear hear him when you can't feel him there's only one thing you can hang on to I'm in the will of God job was saying if I could just find him but he performeth the way I take he I have not I'm not I'm not under judgment right now I've walked in his footsteps his words have constantly been on my mouth yeah he does he's doing these things for me I don't know why I'm here but I'm in the will of God I can't find him but I know know I'm right where he wants me to be maybe you're there tonight maybe you feel like you've hit rock bottom but just make sure you know you're in the will of God and if you are in the will of God don't give up come on now don't give up don't back down don't turn around but keep going forward He Man we've been there we me and my wife's been there you know we've recently went full-time in the ministry and man all hell has turned loose upon it man we're driving down the road a rock up cracks her windshield okay we get to our hotel room we get up the next morning ant are inside of our car I've never even heard of that happening before ants all in the car our heater goes out our our furnace goes out our hot water heater goes out my truck breaks down all this happens since we made the decision to go full time and so we're sitting there did we do something wrong right did did we make the wrong decision and then here I'm studying on these things and I read that job says I'm in the will of God I'm my my his words are being on my lips and I said devil back up we're in the will of God and you can say that ton not devil back up I'm in the will of God I might not understand why I'm going through it but the Gates of Hell cannot Prevail I'm going through it I'm in the will of God for my life you're stable there's a stability you're stabilized Hallelujah Hallelujah and here job you know it was it's so incredible because here James would say look at the patience of Job look at the patience like and you would thank job if he would hear that say patience what do you mean patience I was sitting there saying God if you forsaken me you know God where are you God if I could find you I would relay my heart but you know that word patience in the Greek means perseverance steadfast enduring so James says look at the steadfastness of job even when he was on Rock Bottom he was steadfast oh and may that be the testimony for my life may that be the testimony for your life you might hit rock bottom but you're still patient you're still enduring you're still steadfastness and you would see that that that faith and patience work hand in hand the Apostle Paul would say in Hebrews 6:12 that ye be not slothful but followers of them who through faith and patience inherit the promises and brother Brandon would say only through patience do our souls get life only through patience only through steadfastness only through endurance brother Brandon would tell us that that there there were two two phases the Christianity youall remember that and he would say the first one is is an intellectual or mental conception of God he says Where It's just in the mind and he says then there's a second phase which which is an experimental Faith right and he says you've tasted you've experienced God and he says that's those two phases and he says the first phase the first guy is hungry all the time he says he eats off the things of God but his Feast does not last out but he says the second one he says looks like nothing bothers him and I thought my goodness and if you if you continue on in the quote he says the other one seems to have Victory all the time there's nothing bothers them they're just as solid and anchored as they can be no trials no storms bothers them at all and I thought okay there's still storms there's still trials but it don't bother them you see there's a difference you're still going through trials you're still going through storms but it don't bother you you see you've experienced that this is the will of God you see it's not mental it's not in the mind you see but it's in the soul and brother Brandon would tell us we're Triune being right he would say we're Body Soul and Spirit he would say there's five senses to the body right there's there's sight there's taste there's smell there's hear and there's feeling right he says that's the five senses to the body then he says there's five senses to the spirit man right imagination conscience reasoning affection and memory he says those are five senses to the spirit man but then you've got a soul right and he says the soul there's two senses faith and doubt and what's so incredible is brother brandom says faith rescues you from your five sins of my goodness so whenever your your whenever your five senses of your spirit man is bringing you down faith in the soul rescues you that's why the will of God is in the soul not in the mind you can't be in that first face have a mental conception that you're doing right you got to know from the soul oh that's what brother the brand say you can have the Holy Ghost every day of your life and go straight to hell right you can have it on your flesh you can have it on your spirit man and it's not going to do nothing for you but but it's got to go to the soul the message can't just stay in the mind it can't just go to the Flesh and make you feel good Make You Dance go to the spirit man make you speak in tongues that's great and all but it's got to go to the soul once it goes to the soul then there's a stability that when the speaking in tongues wears off I'm still stable that whenever the feeling wears off I'm still stable when the dancing wears off I'm still stable see it's not in the mind not in the flesh not in the spirit but in the soul oh remember brother Brandon will talk about the three courts of the the Tabernacle in the Old Testament you remember that he was said there was the the outer Court inner court and the most holy place and he says the first chord he says the light was the sky natural light so if it was cloudy it was cloudy in the first chord if it was dark it was dark in there the sun was down it was sunny in there you see so the first Court the the the the light of it was determined by natural conditions then you would go into that second court and brother brandom says the light there was the the candlesticks and he says the candlesticks was lit by the preacher and so the light inside of that second Court was determined by your gifted preacher so if he was going through a trial you went through a trial right but you go into the third Court the holiest of holies the veil is dropped and there ain't no sun in there there ain't no candlestick lighting is the sh Glory you see so there ain't no man-made light no natural conditions it could be cloudy on the outside but it's still light on the inside the preacher might be late but it's still light on the inside and if the will of God anchors in the soul let everybody else do what they want to but there's an anchor on the inside of the Soul hallelujah oh when I say the Rapture is the will of God for your life Let It Go to the soul the body change is the will of God for your life let it go to the soul a Revival is the will of God let it go to the soul not just from the flesh but go to the soul Hallelujah I'm feeling good up here you see but the Brandon would say but in faith there's no reason he said there's no reason you've got it from God you know it's there I don't care how much it looks wrong you know it's still right it's thus saith the Lord he would say now now now this out here Satan just tempts you and knocks you around every way here but down here he can't do it unless you let him do it he says your spirit your flesh and your spirit he can tempt you but down there in the soul he has no control over it unless you let him in it oh got quiet there you see you've got the control over the enemy he can come against your flesh and spirit but where you're stabilized that's where you have to fight it oh now you got to fight it from coming inside of the Soul you see and brother brandham says you know it's right you're walking by thus sayith the Lord and so when you got this thus sayith the Lord it stabilize you and I think you know I seen a meme the other day and and it says that Elijah was the first Trash talker and man I just loved that was so funny could you imagine being Elijah and brother Brandon would tell us he saw Victory a vision so he already knew he was going to get the victory by it was sort of it was sort of an unbalanced uh uh battle here you know because you know as sports players I'm sure you you play you play football you know and if you're that you're stronger than the guy across the line but all of a sudden he gets in your mind starts doing his mind games right he starts talking trash to you and what when the reason why sports players talk trash is the one that get into your head right they know you're better than them they know you're stronger you're faster you know but they want to get into your head and if they can get into your head they mess you up right and here Elijah man it's the these guys the prophets of B knew they had the victory it was just one old man the King was the queen was against him the whole nation was against them and here comes Elijah choose ye this day who you're going to serve if the if the if the bail be God serve him but if God be God serve him and here stands the prophets of bell they're not going to believe this guy we got them so wrapped up in fear we got them so wrapped up they might miss the Rapture if they do that we got them so wrapped up then all of a sudden here comes the prophet say you know what y'all go ahead and go first you do your Showdown you know you do what you think is right here they start dancing there's Elijah cry a little louder maybe he's sleeping maybe he's on vacation maybe he's he's fishing maybe he's doing this he already seen my victory by Vision he knew he was going to win so go you're cutting yourself cut yourself come on to dance a little more yeah come on keep crying oh you're tired oh don't get tired out on me now come on cut yourself a little bit more he already had it by vision and oh man that's the way the bride needs to be devil that's all you got oh you got fear you got car plexes that's all you come on that's all you got try a little harder try a little harder try messing up my marriage try messing up my church try taking my children try taking my preacher try it we've already got Victory by Vision oh Hallelujah come on devil that's all you got cry a little louder amen come on and they would say that's what Muhammad Ali would do and Muhammad Ali would tell him you know oh that's all you got he would just sit there and be dodging oh that's all you got you're not getting tired are you oh come on tral all okay I'm going to start fighting now you see he would get into their mind and man the devil gets into our mind mind many times let's reverse that and say devil that's all you got you don't have enough you see the reason is is we're not fighting with the mind we're fighting with the soul sir it see you can't go Toe to Toe with your intellect you got to go Toe to Toe with the soul where it's anchored down there that's where the will of God is oh Hallelujah and you seeing but the Brandon would tell us that Jesus would had perfect faith and he and and I'm bringing this to a close and brother Brandon would tell us that J that the the two ingredients to perfect faith and he would say was Jesus knew who he was and had no condemnation he would say that imperfect faith and he would tell us and I love it he would say Jesus walked in his own world he said he walked in another world with just perfect faith and he says and when the woman with the issue of blood would come to Jesus and would touch him he says he had so much of this perfect Faith virtues just float out of his garments but I thought man that's powerful but then it don't stop there and then he says and so when a man lives by faith and walks by faith I mean substance Faith you see and fear is trying to take away your substance and this is why we need substance he says I mean substance Faith he is isolated from the entire world and becomes a new creature in Christ there now you're getting into bride material when I read that about one of the shout not Church material they've got profession of Faith but the bride's got substance Faith that's bride material which is stepping into another world oh Hallelujah that's why the gates of hell are trying to come but they're not prevailing you're walking in another world your flesh is walking on this Earth but your soul is in Heavenly Heights in Christ Jesus and he comes and he tempts and he tempts and he tempts but we're in another another world he continues on and becomes a new creature in Christ there now you're getting to brow material see see see you're getting into Rapture condition that this that means for each one of us and I love this part he says not just the pastor deacons trustees that means the Ley every individual that walks in the world is with God Alone every individual that walks with God is in a world alone oh then he then he would say then he would say that just like virtue came out of Jesus garments he says when you're walking in this world with God virtue comes out of your garments ain't that incredible so now the very flesh oh I love it you know the very garments that made Jesus human was now bringing Deliverance for the SW with the issue of blood right he laid aside his Royal garments and put on your garments he came in human flesh he came he came in Dusty garments and here that garment gave virtue and here now you're garment your flesh your Humanity you see you're not on Earth to glorify God with your flesh you're on or you're on Earth to glory god in your flesh you see your flesh can't Glory the devil but inside of that flesh your soul can be so stabilized that the virtues of God starts to flow out of your life you're walking in a world alone with God let our musicians come but the brandist say now perfect Faith Masters all conditions all circumstances and I love how brother br but put it cuz many times you know I've heard this and it almost sounds like it change it can change conditions and it can your faith can change situations but but the brandom continues on in there he would say the Lord's revealed that this certain thing is going to happen just speak on it and go on he says just don't ask any questions it's all over just keep going see it Masters all circumstances well if you do this so and so is going to do he says see there you see it's got it mastered faith believes God will work it out I don't know how he's going to do it but he'll do it anyhow see Masters all circumstances so faith and mastering all circumstances is saying I don't know how it's going to happen but it's going to happen you see many times we want to see the victory before we believe that there's going to be Victory oh now you see job was on his ass sheep and what I what's so incredible is job would say you know if a man die shall live again you if I could just find God then I would talk to him he had all of these questions because he lacked inspiration but what would happen the Bible would tell us that the Thunder would begin to Roar right and what would happen job would have just hear thunder he heard a voice and what would that voice do the voice would lift him up he would say I know my redeemer liveth so the very one he was looking for he would then see what else would he say in my flesh amen I shall see God so before the Thunder he was saying if a man die shall he live again he had questions he was looking for the answers but after the voice spoke to the Thunder he found the will of God for his life I'm not just going to go in the grave and die if a man die shall he live again I don't know but then the will of God would be unveiled in your flesh if you go the way of the grave and your skin worms destroy thy body in in your flesh you're going to see me I thought oh brother the brandom would tell us that the Thunder is the voice of God you see we got more than just thunders in this generation people still looking for the Myster of the Thunders we got the voice of God we got the will of God and in your flesh you're going to see God I believe this message has got every answer to every question whatever you have need of God has the has the answer to it and here joob and would think that I I've often thought this that after job would say this I know my redeemer liveth and on that day I'll say in my flesh I'll see God those skin worms you know destroy this body he's still there on his as sheep right he didn't wait till he was out of the trial to confess it but while he was still in the trial he was already confessing it already confessing it and you may still be in your trial but keep confessing it keep confessing the promises of God keep confessing you know the the Bible would tell us that Jesus told the disciples you know go go Terry ye in the city of Jerusalem and tell you be endued with power upon High and the word Terry in the Hebrew means to stay abide continue to stay in expectation and somebody would ask a question to brother Brandon and would say What's the difference between tering ye in Jerusalem until you renewed and with Jesus breathing on them and says receive the Holy Ghost he that they asked the question what's the difference but brandom says whenever Jesus breathed on them and said receive ye the Holy Ghost he says that was the promise of it he says but they had to go Terry to receive the Fulfillment of it oh and Terry is the stay in expectation so God would give them the promise but they had to stay in expectation to receive the promise oh and God has stabilized us with his word but we still got to stay in expectation we got to stay expectation if the Lord don't come today he's coming tomorrow if he don't come tomorrow he's coming next week if he don't come next week he's coming the next week you see we're staying in expectation and all of a sudden they were together in one Accord in the upper room and their expectation would break way into eternity and your expectation is going to break way into eternity don't give up on your faith don't give up on your expectation If You're Expecting loved ones to come back to the house of God keep expecting for it you got to chry you got to endure you got to be patient let's bow our heads tonight your gracious Heavenly Father Lord how I love you tonight Lord and I know everyone in this building loves you father Lord Lord no doubt there's many that are going through through struggles and trials just like job Lord but Lord may they keep their eyes on the will of the father we say not my will but thy will be be done Lord if there's some here that is struggling Lord may they find some strength tonight in the word of God that they can strengthen their soul lord may they get an anchor on the inside Lord and be like the Apostle Paul I'm harnessed to it none of these things move me Lord your Prophet would tell us that job would tie himself to the Revelation that the Thunders would bring Lord may we tie oursel to the will of God tonight Lord if we have ups and downs and trials and circumstances nothing bothers us Lord we love you father in the name of Jesus Amen you love the Lord tonight let's all stand and what I love about the end of the story of job is the last chapter the the Lord would speak to job's friends and would say now my wrath is kindled against you he says the Lord would say there in job 42 he says because you have not spoken good of me like job have and I thought wow here job Rock Bottom didn't even feel God but God was still watching amen God was now now God's rewarding his patience after the end of it all now he's coming against the critics the very ones that was speaking against job his wrath was kindled against him and the Very spirits that speak against you the wrath of God's being kindled against it and God's watching you in every situation you go through he's watching your steadfastness he's watching your endurance he's watching it says oh yeah right there he's still speaking of me he's still keeping the eye on the will amen what are you playing to I'm [Music] sorry I'll just throw up my hands and praise you again again and again [Music] ISU hallelu I know it's not much [Music] oh of my hands I praise you again
