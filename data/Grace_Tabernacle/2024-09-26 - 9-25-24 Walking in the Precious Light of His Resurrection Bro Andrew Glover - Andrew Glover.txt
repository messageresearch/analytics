tossed about it gives out a life that I might see and the light that shines in darkness now will safely lead us home for if it wasn't for the liouse my ship would sail no more I thank God for the liouse for I owe my life to him for Jesus is the lighthouse and from the rocks of sin he has shown the light around me that I might clearly see but if it wasn't for that old Li house tell me where

we've been LED from the paths of wickedness to the paths of righteousness and amen we've been called by his name isn't it an honor tonight to know him amen I just stand in there thinking a few years ago I had the privilege to meet the man who wrote that song I many of you all probably know him Ronnie Henson sang with the Henson for years and I stood there and talked to him for a few moments and he was just sharing with me about the inspiration and how he's heard it sung so many times and I couldn't help but think amen that's a beautiful song but it's totally different when a Believer sings it amen not a performance but from a reality tonight and amen you love the Lord this evening amen maybe we just buy our hearts together for a word of prayer I know there's many needs among us tonight amen but we know he's able and we know he's moving in the midst of his church maybe you just have something on on your heart tonight I believe he sees your hand and I believe he's able to move on the face of the conditions Heavenly Father Lord as your Believers have gathered here on this Wednesday afternoon father we come here Lord because there's a deep calling to the Deep on the inside of our souls Lord there's more than just a religious feeling or just a church feeling but Lord there's a group of Believers here tonight Lord who have met you beyond the ideas of a church or beyond the ideas of a system but Lord they've experienced you we've experienced your power the power of your Resurrection the power of your blood Lord the power of forgiveness the power of justification Lord we want to thank you tonight Lord we want to thank you for being more Lord than just our savior but Lord we want to thank you for being our Lord father you have become the Lord of our life and Lord we want to do everything that pleases you and Lord we don't want to do anything that displeases you and father as we come here tonight we know there's many needs maybe sicknesses in and bodies but Lord I know you're able you're well able to move in the meeting tonight so we invite you Lord may you come among us tonight dear God may you give strength Lord to those who would be weak father Lord may you give

action oh God now Lord we commit this meeting in our faithful hands in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ we pray and all the Believers says amen and amen God bless you this evening if you have your Bibles while you're standing with us we want to turn in the scripture we want to look in the book of First Corinthians 15 and then also we have a couple places we want to read from the book of Luke and the Book of John amen 1 Corinthians 15 and while you're turn there tonight we want to greet you all in the name of the Lord Jesus it's a honor to be here tonight and good to be home and have this opportunity to speak to you and amen appreciate brother Matt for allowing us to amen speak to you tonight from the word of the Lord and I know amen there's uh many needs among us but we know the Lord's among us as well and amen I know it's a it's a dark time but it's also a time of light to the Believers and amen we do want to just thank you all once again for amen all you've done to help us in the move and support we want to say God bless you all and appreciate it and amen is't it good to go to church on a Wednesday night and see so many Believers out amen don't have to be here but they want to be here and amen good to see you brother Samuel and Isaiah God bless you all amen last time I seen you was headed west so I guess you're headed back East amen sure good to see you all 1 Corinthians chapter 15 and verse number one Paul here writing he says moreover Brethren I declare unto you the gospel somebody say the gospel which I preached unto you which also you have received and wherein you stand by which also ye are saved if you keep in memory what I preached unto you unless you have believed in vain for I delivered unto you first of all that which I also received how that Christ died for our sins according to the scriptures and that he was buried and that he rose again the third day according to the scripture now that's astounding to me that everything he did from his birth to his life to his death and according to the scripture and his resurrection he did that all according to the scripture now in the book of St Luke the 24th chapter it's a very very very familiar reading in St Luke chapter 24 uh brother Brandon will use this text many times uh speaking on when their eyes were open they knew him and he refers to it many times in St Luke 24 and verse 30 the two were walking on the road to Aus and this is actually after Christ is raised from the dead and he appears to him and in the in the 29th verse it says but they constrained him saying abide with us for it is toward evening and the day is far spent and he went in to Terry with them and it came to pass as he set at meat with him he took bread and blessed it and break and gave to them now notice this and their eyes were opened and they knew him and he vanished out of their sight now watch in verse 32 and they said one to another did not our hearts burn within us while he talked with us by the way and while he opened to us the scriptures so he's just raised according to the scripture and now he speaking to them from the scripture now if the scripture speaks of the bridegroom I believe it has to speak of the Bride as well so in St John chapter 14 one verse I want to read there St John 14 and verse 19 brother Brandon picks this up and it is the rising of the Sun in St John 14:19 he says now yet a little while and the world seeth me no more but ye see me because I live ye shall live on also brother B said speaking to his wife because I live ye shall live also we ask the Lord this evening to add the blessing to the reading of his word as you can have your seats here amen I want to from those scriptures for a few moments if I would take a title tonight I want to title this walking in the precious light of his resurrection amen walking in the precious light of his resurrection how many amen is thankful tonight for the promise amen of the Resurrection you know just to read a few quotes here to lay a foundation brother I'm speaking and I know my redeemer liveth 1958 he's praying he says Dear God we are grateful this morning to be the people that is called by thy name we are so glad that we do not have to just imagine anymore amen of a great resurrection that is to come he said because it's become a reality to us as we read it in thy word and see that thou H has promised this and filled it within our souls amen That Jesus Lives now that's very astounding to me amen that as one reads the word concerning the resurrection that it actually has the ability to become a reality amen as you read about it in other words amen you're no longer just reading about something that's in the future amen but it's actually becoming a reality in the present he said we are thinking this morning of the many heartaches that's been in life and the many sadnesses that we went through and the experiences that has toring us and throwing us to The Winds of the earth he said how that we have buried our loved ones and we mourned at the grave he said and our soul just seems to almost perish within us amen but then we can think of today oh what it means that Jesus is raised from the dead he has spoed every Power of the enemy when he rose up triumphant he took all the Shadows away he said and now we walk in the precious light of his resurrection amen because he rose from the grave according to the scripture amen we are now walking in the precious light of his resurrection again he says I know that my My Redeemer liveth and at the last day he will stand upon the Earth though after the skin worms destroy this body yet in my flesh shall I see God I'm speaking of job he said he seen the resurrection would be brought about by a man someday the sin question would be settled when that righteous one the Son of God Amen came to die for Sinners there was no man on the earth at that time or no man sense that could ever Bridge the way between a holy God and a sinful man man but job here 4,000 years before his coming he saw his death his burial and his resurrection and his justification that came by the resurrection now watch brother R does not just leave this on the Lord amen but he says and the absolute guarantee amen of the resurrection of the believer so because job saw amen that there would come a resurrection by the Son of God he could also see that whoever believed in him amen would also be a part of the Resurrection C he said then what a comfort it is to know amen that those things are true that it's not a fiction story let me say the gospel is not a fiction story amen the gospel is the birth it is the life it is the death it is the burial and it is also the resurrection amen of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ and I want to say Amen there's not many gospels there's only one gospel amen and it is the true gospel and the prophet of God said if there is another gospel amen as Paul spoke spoke to one of those groups he said I'm so surprised amen that you are turned to another gospel which there is no other amen but a make belief gospel Amen to a denominational fiction amen turning from that good news and because I live ye live also and I live in you and the works that I do John 14 The Works I do amen will identify myself in you he says what a message amen no wonder we've had a dark world of theology amen but in the evening time amen there shall come light again amen job saw light in the morning time amen by the resurrection of the Lord Jesus Christ amen but in the evening time brother B says there will be a resurrection in the evening time amen because I live ye live also see amen what a resurrection that that was amen but what a resurrection this is Amen to be quickened from the dead and to be made alive in Christ Jesus by God quickening power amen so tonight we're not sitting here amen looking back at the resurrection 2,000 years ago and saying what a resurrection what a move of God what a manifestation amen but because the light has returned amen we can say tonight amen The Same Spirit that raised our Lord from the dead back there has returned to the church by the message of the hour and we can say that the word of God Amen is not a fiction amen it's not a fairy tale amen the word of God is a resurrection power he said now this is not fiction this is the Bible it's God's truth it's his promise I have tried it I have tested it and I know you can amen take God's word and he will make it right with you amen he will bring it to pass brother said now we know there's going to be amen an absolute guarantee of a resurrection now brother took time to tell us amen what that word absolute means it means perfect in itself it is Unlimited in its power and it is primarily an ultimate see it's Unlimited in its power it's perfect in itself and it really is an ultimate re said therefore I think everybody amen should have an ultimate every great achievement that is ever been achieved there's been an absolute behind it see no matter what it was it had an absolute behind it and every person in order to achieve something amen has to First have an absolute he said that's the final wine back amen through this through that through the other amen till you come back to the absolute or the amen or the ultimate you cannot go on through life amen without having an absolute I also took time to look up what the word guarantee mean and the word guarantee is a formal promise amen or assurance that is typically in writing amen that certain conditions will be fulfilled it is something that gives a certainty amen of an outcome so when you have a guarantee you have a formal writing amen that something is going to happen amen and whatever you're in you're going to come out now y'all remember I spoke to you a few months ago on coming out of situations amen and how there'll be an outcome amen remember the definition of outcome just turn the words around and it's come out so amen whatever you're going through according to the word of the Lord you're going to come out of it amen because we don't just have a feeling you're going to come out we don't just have a sensation you're going to come out amen but we have an absolute guarantee Amen in the word of God now I'll just say this the only absolute guarantee that I know of Amen is the revealed word of God that has been brought to us through a Vindicated Prophet amen It Was Written in the Bible brother messages didn't come from a school amen it came from the Bible it was written in the Bible amen but then a prophet be to interpret it amen and the written word became the manifested word and now today the word made flesh amen is the manifestation of the word of God that's why Paul would say are Epistles written in our hearts you are known and read of all men for as much as you're manifestly declared to be the Epistle of Christ ministered by us amen written not with thinkk amen but with the spirit of the Living God Amen not in the tables of stone but in the fleshly tables of the heart Paul would again say in Hebrews 8:10 he says I will put my laws into their mind amen and I will will write them in their heart amen so God has chosen a covenant people in the last days amen who will not be a billboard for denomination they will not be an advertisement for some religious idea amen but they will be a people who will be underneath a covenant and by that Covenant They will receive amen the engrafted word which is able to save their soul he said therefore the man's spirit is Blended out amen and God comes in and takes over he said then they got Fellowship one with another and the Very God that created the heavens and the Earth that wrote his word amen is dwelling in you and you'll believe everything God wrote is the truth and you will accept it you will believe it you will hold on to it amen and you will have fellowship with it amen so this is more amen than just writings this is more than just Scrolls amen but this is inspiration because the Bible says that all scripture is given by inspiration of God it is profitable for Doctrine for Repro for correction for instruction and righteousness said many of the prophets in writing amen they did not know what they were writing amen they just wrote it down amen because it was inspiration see what they were doing amen is they were writing prophecy amen of the coming Messiah amen which was the one that job saw 4,000 years ahead of time who would who would bridge the gap between a holy God and a handful man listen the Bible says in John 5:46 Jesus standing there he said for had you believed Moses amen you would believe me now watch what he says amen for he wrote Of Me amen look at this word wrote it means to describe it means to write to commit to writing amen it is things amen that are not to be forgotten it means to write down to record it is used of those things which stand written in the sacred books of the Old Testament now you know the Bible is broken down in two parts amen the Old Testament amen and the New Testament if I can just give it to you real simple the Old Testament said he's coming he's coming he's coming and when he comes he'll do this when hears he'll do this but in the New Testament it was no longer saying he's coming amen it was now saying he was here that's why on tape you'll hear Brother brand reading Old Testament scripture and he would say now I'd like to back this up amen with the Fulfillment see because it was not just coming to stay in letter form it was coming to move into fresh form listen then Jesus looks at him and he says but if you believe not his writings amen then how shall you believe my words see Jesus was the manifestation amen of the words the prop of God said this baby down there amen an illegitimate birth in a cow stable amen how could that be this guy didn't go to any school he had no credentials he had no Fellowship card he didn't belong to an organization they didn't know anything about about him how could this be anything amen but it was see they failed to see it and he said the works that I do amen they testify of me what did he say go search the scriptures amen for in them you think you have eternal life and they are they that testify amen they tell you who I am he said they are my testimony amen so the scriptures amen were the testimony of Jesus Christ he said if thou don't if you don't believe me then believe The Works that I do they tell you who I am they said well we have Moses and we're going to believe Moses he said if you believe Moses amen then you would believe me amen because he wrote Of Me In other words you're going back and reading things amen that were recorded that were not to be forgotten amen but you're trying to hold on to the writings instead of walking into the Perfection or the Fulfillment of what he was writing about listen the part of God said see amen they were so dark and still they couldn't see it he said I wonder if that could repeat he said it's prophesied to you know it was prophet it was prophesied to there you say when in this day so in this day the people are going to be dark again and they're going to miss the Fulfillment of the writings of the word of God let me say it as plain as I know how amen Jesus was the scriptural light of the day the prophet of God said Jesus was all the inspired prophets Tes tonies all their prophecy amen was brought to light in his age that had been prophesied for his age he said he lit up every candle of word amen that was in the Bible and that was prophesied of him he said see a virgin shall conceive and she did he said his name Shall be Called counselor Prince of Peace the Mighty God the Everlasting father and he was he said now watch and the eyes of the blind shall see amen and they did see notice everything that was prophesied of him amen it happened when he came on the earth and everything he done could be found Amen in Jeremiah or in Zachariah amen or in Ezekiel or in Daniel Amen or In Jonah listen friends we are not following something that we pulled up out of the air we're not following some PP dream or some idea we are following a scriptural Vindicated word and it has the power Amen to lead us from the confusion of the age that we're living in into the reality of the resurrection of Jesus Christ I do not believe we have to back up off of the word of God Amen to get a victory in our life we don't have to back off of the promises of God Amen to get a holy ghost feeling there is a word and it is a powerful word it just needs somebody to recognize it's more than a writing it has become flesh now look here the scripture amen they cannot be broken in other words they must somebody say they must the scriptures must be fulfilled that's why Jesus stood there and he said Heaven and Earth shall pass away he said but my words amen they shall not pass away but said God's word is so real and that's just enough scripture right there Amen to take all the communism out of the world and convert the entire world it is an invitation Amen to Salvation it is also an invitation to Healing it is the guarantee amen of eternal life amen the scriptures are the guarantee of eternal life if you want to know whether you got eternal life or not amen don't go to some preacher amen don't go to some church amen don't go to some idea amen go to the scriptures amen and find out if the scripture Bears record with the spirit that's on the inside of your soul said see oh it means so much if it be received Amen in the light that it's wrote in so when you receive the scripture in the light it was wrote in it has more of a meaning now let me say this eternal life amen it's not a feeling amen it's not a sensation it's not an emotion amen but eternal life is a guarantee amen it's a guarantee to the believer what is it it's a written Divine promise and you can read it brother John right there brother John Amen in first John amen you can read the promise he said let therefore abide in you which you have heard from the beginning if that which you heard from the beginning shall remain in you you also shall continue in the son and in the father and this is the promise that he has promised us amen even eternal life listen this message of the hour amen has restored the Bible promise of eternal life amen back to the church when the world is trying to find a way Amen to live forever they're trying to find a way to escape their problems amen denomination has so watered down and diluted amen the reality of eternal life but in the evening time it shall be light there would be a prophet who would return to the church and he would go in the scripture and he would find a promise and say listen we're thankful to be alive and to have this great revelation of eternal life dwelling within us see we've come tonight father Amen to study that word together he said these great Hidden Mysteries that's been hid since the foundation of the world and the lamb is the only one that can reveal it to us he said so I pray that he will come among us tonight and will take a hold of his word and will reveal it to us that we might know how to be better servants to him in this end time so in other words the one who wrote the book oh Church the one who wrote the promises the one who described them and the one who had men to write about them Amen in the last days listen he didn't send amen Jeremiah to brandom Tabernacle to reveal the Mysteries he did not send Isaiah Amen to reveal the Mysteries but the lamb came down himself and begin to reveal amen the word and the secret that was in the word of God listen friends I say tonight amen the same lamb amen that is in the Book of Revelation amen the Lamb of God is right here in this building tonight in the form of a word Amen to reveal to you that you are not just church members you are not just citizens of a county or citizens of a country you are the kingdom delegat you have come from God and you got to go back to God and there's a word to carry you to where you got to go you see the Bible is full of promises now I'll say this the promises or written guarantees to the believer now there are many many many promises but I'm just thankful for one tonight I want to speak to you for a few moment on Amen is the promise of Light how many can thank God for the promise of light in Zechariah 14 in verse 6 the Bible says it's a prophecy it shall come to pass in that day that the light shall not be clear nor dark amen but it shall be one day which shall be known to the Lord not day nor night but it shall come to pass that at the evening time it shall be light amen at the evening time it shall be light how many's heard that scripture at the evening time it shall be light brother said the evening light promised amen by the prophet of God in Zechariah 14:7 May again open the true believer's eyes to the events that's taking place today amen that's proved by the prophecies that we're at the end time amen Jesus is coming he said the prophet of God said it shall be light again about the evening time the sun s o n will peep out again it shall be light he said what the same son s so n that was revealed in flesh at the morning time back there amen will be revealed again in the evening time listen friends it's the same sign the only difference is the flesh that is revealing itself through in the morning time he revealed himself to the Flesh of Jesus but in the evening time he's going to reveal himself a into the Flesh of the Bride of Jesus listen you're not just a bunch of church members you are the flesh that has been redeemed by the blood of Jesus Christ you have been put in position by the word of God to see the promises fulfilled not in Paul's day not in Moses's day not even in brother brandom's day but right here in your day the light has a shined again yes Hallelujah the evening light is Revealing Light now can I I say this it's also prophetic light according to Isaiah 60:1 you love your Bibles let's read a minute Isaiah 6 verse1 he says arise and shine amen if you got your Bible there in a PIN handy underline these next words for thy light is come not in anybody's light but arise and shine for thy light is come and the glory of the Lord is Arisen upon thee he says now for Behold The Darkness shall cover the Earth and gross Darkness to people but the Lord shall arise upon thee and His glory shall be seen upon thee brother comes along in Shalom he says now good morning and that means peace he said darkness is gathering amen but what's it gathering for to show the light so when you see Darkness Gathering it's gathering for one purpose to show the light see Isaiah 60 said that he said that's the reason I can say shalom the light has come to you oh God hey the light has come to you he said God's peace to the elected woman to the elected lady those who God before the foundation of the world Amen called out and ordained to that now watch verse three amen and the Gentiles amen shall come to thy light so the Bible says thy light is come amen which is us our light is come but now watch it says and the Gentiles shall come to the light so brother Joel it doesn't say Amen that the light shall come to the Gentiles amen but the light is going to pull the Gentiles said what is it amen the light Vindicated again is God's word so that you can see God manifested in his promise of the light of the day or the word given to this age the promises that's made for this day the promises that was said by the prophets and by Jesus and self Amen in this day see notice Hebrews 1 God in sunnd times divers manners amen spake to their fathers through the prophets but in this last day amen through his son Jesus Christ let me just go ahead and get this out in the open okay amen we're all Gentiles all right amen can we all agree on that we're all Gentiles I know I know people go and it's a big thing right now brother Bobby to do your DNA and and people come up with all kinds of DNA and God bless you but let's just settle it right now amen we've seen guys do their DNA run off on tangents and amen they got 2% Jew and 5% Jew and all of a sudden they're Moses and Elijah amen but let's come back to the Bible we're Gentiles come on we're Gentiles amen and without this light we have nothing now come on so because we're Gentiles the Bible said that this light would come but it would not come as a bul it would not come amen as just a little something but the Bible say Jesus looked at him and said I am the light of the world he said but he that followeth me amen shall not walk Amen in darkness but he shall have the light of Life see without light amen nothing can live the prophet of God said no one could deny that Israel had light they were the only people who had light as a nation it was as when Egypt was so dark that one could feel a me they could feel the darkness now listen friends that a heavy darkness when you can literally feel amen the darkness it's one thing Amen to see the darkness it's another thing to feel it he said see it was in Egypt so dark amen but in the homes of the Israelites there was light so while the whole land of Egypt was covered in darkness and it was such a great Darkness it could be felt there were some Israelite homes that had some light that was shining in there he said but now amen True light has come he said said the light of the world is Jesus Moses and the prophets they brought the light amen by the means of the scripture amen relevant to the Messiah thus Israel had light but now the Fulfillment of the light has come and what was but glowing word has now broke forth into the brightness of God and is manifested among his people in other words when Moses walked in there and read the Scrolls he was bringing light into those homes but there was a day that what he was reading about was going to become flesh and it would not be Moses carrying the Scrolls it would be the Fulfillment of what Moses was reading about would walk into every home it would walk into every life oh Church of the Living God I say lift up your Gates and welcome the true L who is the true L it's none other than the Lord Jesus Christ Hall when he walks into a life when he walks into a home when he walks into a family he literally lights up the whole entire thing sir amen watch the part of God said as the pillar of fire gave light at night and that was wonderful he said but now light and life were manifested in the fullness of the godhead bodily when the light of life is shining he says to bring that seed what could it do upon on a rock it'll do nothing what could it do upon dead substance it's not sent for dead substance The Sun Shines for a seed that is gerti to life and this Bible and his word oh God in the hour that we're living in brother Joe is shining upon those to catch the eternal life those who are predestinated to see it listen friends we are not walking around amen stumbling in darkness but there was a seed in your soul from before the foundation from before the foundation of the world Brother David there was a seed there that when light would come that seed was already eternal life now watch what a pro God said and it won't do one bit of good upon the rest them there's no life in there to come forth by the Sun or by the light now I say this this light has brought a resurrection in St Matthew chap 4:1 16 the Bible says the people which sat Amen in the darkness they saw a great light and to them which sat in the region and the shadow of death amen light is sprung up I want you to catch this the people are sitting but when light comes light doesn't come in the same position they're in they are sitting in darkness but when the light comes the light Springs up now do you realize that that's a prophecy from Isaiah 9 and2 let's read it Isaiah 9 and2 it says the people amen that walked in darkness have seen a great light now listen here and they that dwell in the land of the shadow of death upon them have a light shine so now it's not just sitting in the shadow or the regions of the shadow of death amen but now the whole land is underneath the shadow of death and I say this to you friends we are living in a world that you cannot go anywhere without seeing the shadow amen of Darkness upon it you go to the White House and there's a shadow of Darkness there you go to the church house and there's a shadow of Darkness there you go to the Vatican there's a shadow of Darkness there you go to the Educational Systems there's a shadow of Darkness there go to Wall Street come on Church go wherever you want to and the land you're living in is covered in death it's covered in a shadow but the prophet of God said this he said but Matthew 4 said he would bring light to the Gentiles who were possessed and they were condemned by God in their Idols but he come as a light God the Gentiles were possessed they were possessed by idols and they were condemned by Idols but what did he say he said today the light of God is the word of God made manifest he said that's the light made manifest the light is the works of God Amen spoken by the word of God brought to life now listen and if a greater light than it was at the dawn of creation Now think about that amen the Bible says in Psalms 23:4 he says yay though I walk are you hearing me amen yay though I walk through the valley of the shadow of death he says I will fear no evil how many can say Amen to that for thou art with me thy rod and thy staff they comfort me remember so we always use a dark working there see it's not see it's the Valley of the Shadow it's not the dark shadow or the dark Valley it's the Valley of the shadow of death he said now showing that if it's got a shadow there has to be a certain percent of light or it would make a Shadow so if I oh God so if in death itself is just a shadow in other words it's a scarecrow to the believer amen trying to scare him when there's enough mixed into it to show that there's light somewhere oh Church of the Living God listen you're in the land that is covered by the shadow of death listen the politics is covered everywhere you walk is covered but there's a reason why that you're walking through the valley of the shadow of death but it has no effect upon you is because you are a gentile who was a part A prophetic word that when the light would come in the evening time it shall in the evening time it shall be light and this light will literally pull you it'll draw you right out from the influence of the land of death you're dwelling in come on Church said let me say one more thing he says there's a man here yes sir there's a man here who can turn on the light y'all remember where that come from the little girl little sister goes down in the in the in the cave and Carls bad stand down there in the cave it's real dark she gets real scared then all of a sudden I love this all of a sudden a voice screams out and says don't who can turn on the light he didn't say there's a man coming he said there's a man here he's already here listen amen we got a reason to fear brother anthon if he's on his way we got a reason to fear if he's coming but if a prophet has made an announcement he's not coming he's here then we can stand up tonight and rebuke every fear and say light has come to the Gentiles to call them out of the confusion of the age they're living in Hallelujah there is a man here that can turn on the lights those who sat in the regions of the shadow of death look what brother says some of them under cancer right some of them under the shadow of the death of denomination some of them were under Creed death some of them were under traditional death all them kind of death but they seen a great light he said the man that flash the lights is the same one who said in the beginning let there be light that same God God yesterday today and forever he is present today he is right here now amen don't you get scared somebody say don't get scared don't get scared there's a man here who can turn on the lights when the persecution comes don't get scared amen when tribulation comes don't get scared there's a man here brother brandom it looks awful dark no matter how dark it gets you can't see your hand before you you just remember there is a man here who can turn on the line and he will Rapture that church when the light comes on is the same light that's going to Rapture you off of this Earth glory to God I know it's Wednesday night and I'm trying to behave but there's a man here who can turn on the light you say preacher it's getting awful hot in Le outa well just remember Shadrach mesach and abedo the Bible says they went up in the fiery furnace and a prophet said but there's a man there who can turn on the air well there's a man who can turn on the light and there's a man who can turn on the air in other words the rushing Mighty Wind that come down on the day of Pentecost he turned it on again and F all the breeze Church of the Living God there was a man there he's called The Fourth Man there is one today he's the only one he's got the light switch in his hand those who sat in the regions of the shadow of death great light sprung up now watch you Prophet don't reject it receive it in the name of the Lord watch a prophet he that hath an ear let him hear what the spirit is saying in the churches how tragic it is that the first age did not listen to the spirit but instead it listened to man but thank God in these last age there will be a group rise up the true bride of Christ and she will listen to the spirit and in that day of gross darkness in that day of gross Darkness there will oh God amen light will return in the day of gross Darkness light will return by the pure word and we will return to the power of Pentecost to welcome back our Lord Jesus Christ but it's always though when light comes amen people love Darkness more than they love light in St John 3:19 this is the condemnation look at this word condemnation it's a separating it's a sundering it's a trial or a contest so we can say this is the trial this is the contest that light has come into the world and Men love Darkness rather than light because their deeds were evil now watch this for everyone that doeth evil hateth the light neither cometh to the light lest his deeds should be reproved but he that doeth truth cometh to the light that his deeds may be made manifest that they are wal in God so in other words the devil now I'm going to preach for a second because the devil tells every one of us we are condemned he tells us we've gone too far we've made too many mistakes we've done too many things wrong and we are condemned and the devil stops many people from even coming to church amen by just telling them amen you're condemned so there's no need to go but let me just go ahead and say this tonight amen you didn't come Amen to a Wednesday night movie night come on you didn't come to pop not down the church house you didn't come to a to to a social Gathering you come to the house of God listen you came here tonight knowing that the word of God was going to be preached and you know that word is a sword and it's sharper and more powerful than any two-edged sword you know you come here knowing that God knows everything about you the preacher knows nothing but when that word begins to move that word has the ability Amen to separate you from the confusion and bring you into the peace it has the ability to separate you from the sin and bring you into the righteousness of God let me say this if anybody's condemned it's not you for coming to church it's the devil that tried to stop you come on church are y'all hearing me you come here tonight knowing the word of God has the ability to expose everything about our lives come on either we believe it or we don't you come here tonight knowing the word of God Amen has has the ability Amen to reveal things amen nobody knows about nothing and the preacher gets up preaching he don't know nothing and all of a sudden the word of God begins to speak right direct to you what is that that's the word that's the light that's the light and it has the ability Amen to condemn the wrong let me say this the son is the king of all lights on this Earth in the natural light he said no matter how much artificial L that we can have how many great electric Rays we can produce when that sun rises all the rest of them di out he said that's the same thing it is with the word of God when the word of God Rises all superstitions denominational fanaticisms and things spread away and it shows just exactly what it is he said the word of God made manifest it always separates amen the light from the darkness he said his word is superior over all man's words over all anything thing his word is light so when light comes it's going to expose the evil and reveal the truth Church of the Living God and you're sitting here tonight and the devil says I'm going to get you I'm going to expose you I'm going to reveal you amen but it's time to look that devil in the face and remind him who you are you are a gentile who was saved by the grace of Jesus Christ and have been pulled into the light of Jesus Christ and the word you're walking underneath it's not a church light it's not a man-made light it's not an artificial light it's a word light it's a messiah light it's a Revealing Light and it has the ability Amen to uncover everything let me say this I challenge you like the prophet of God said he said light is so much more powerful it just puts the darkness out when the light begins to shine it just puts the darkness out can you take prophetic instruction don't you sit in darkness no more well this is the way it's always been don't you sit Amen in darkness anymore well brother Andy you don't know how bad don't you sit in darkness anymore the light has come the great conqueror is here so now the light oh God is a conquering light what is this light it's the evening light which is the manifestation of the Resurrection remember said the evening lights was the manifestation of the Resurrection now what does this light do remember said we see the lights are here and what does it do Amen to have light if you haven't got any eyes to see how to get around in it see what is the evening light the light comes on to reveal something is that right if there's something here and you feel and you can't understand what it is in the darkness then turn a light on it's to reveal what Malachi for to do see do the same thing what was the opening of The Seven Seals to do where all these denominations were staggering around in this is to reveal to bring out if you haven't got any eyes then what's the use to reveal there has to be eyes first to see is that right so when there's eyes there will be light and when the light comes on it will reveal Malachi 4 it will reveal Luke 17:30 it will reveal John 14:12 it will reveal John 1524 and John 16:13 and to also reveal Revelation 10 1-7 the opening of those Seven Seals the seventh Angel's message to open up to reveal when the evening lights are come listen friends if you're walking with this message you're walking with none other than the resurrected scriptures that were promised to be fulfilled in this day come on Church you know they crucified Malachi 4 you know they crucified John 14 and buried Mark 16 and did and did away with Acts 2 and rejected John 16 and rejected Revelations 5 hey but in the evening time it shall be light again come on Church you imagine the two on the road to Emmas they been walking with Jesus they were walking with scripture that they tried to kill oh God they tried to kill but they couldn't kill it because it was gerti word are you hearing me tonight they were literally listen he they they had read where he said amen his body will be broken his body will be bruised but not a bone will be broken rather and here they've read that but now brother Joel they're walking they're walking down the road and they're looking over right there and there is what they were reading about in flesh are you hearing me they read that his holy one would not see corruption neither would he leave his soul in hell for oh God and here they're walking with what he read about are you all hearing me listen in the evening time the same light that brought that Resurrection would bring a spiritual resurrection and the scripture that has been thrown away has been cast aside has been put under foot and trotten down would be resurrected by the evening life listen I'm not looking at Malachi 4 I'm walking with Malachi 4 I'm not looking at John 14 I'm walking I'm not looking at Mark 16 I'm walking I'm walking with Mark 16 I'm not looking at Revelations 5 I'm walking the emus Road and as we're walking together we're having fellowship and as we're having Fellowship he's opening in my eyes and I'm walking in the precious line of the promise of there Resurrection listen friends we're not reading the word in darkness we're reading the word in light what are you saying preacher I'm saying we have received the word I know I'm going slow but I hope I'm laying this in there we have received the word in the same light it was rode in the same light that wrote he would not suffer his holy one to see corruption was the same light that appeared on the emus Road are you hearing me and walk down the rod with him and as he walked with him he began to talk to him you say what are you talking about well it's Exodus 13:21 the Lord went before them by day in a pillar of cloud to lead them the way and by night in a pillar of fire to give them light to go by day and night listen he took not away the pillar of cloud by day nor the pillar of Fire by night from before the people brother said God is light we know that Pillar of Fire can I say this to you original light is not what you see harnessed in these light bulbs that's right can I say what that is that's artificial light original light is the sun it's the fire of God oh church he said then Joseph and all them wrote went on everyone wrote back in that day but when Moses came on the scene he had the Revelation he had met the pillar of fire he said the disciples just wrote What They Se him do but Moses had the Revelation so he went down into Egypt for three years and studied and seen that the god of the Old Testament was the Jesus of the new the Revelation and he come out and said think of it the same Pillar of Fire that came upon those men that wrote the Bible is the same Pillar of Fire that is here today interpreting the Bible so there is a rri to the Bible but then brother Morgan there is an interpreting may I say to you tonight brother Bobby we are not living in the writing we are living in the interpreting of the word of God in the age we're living how we thank him for that same what a comfort what an identification I'm so glad to be identified in that I don't know what to do I'd rather be identified in that than all the Baptist Methodist Presbyterian Lutheran all the rest of them identified in that word where the Shak glory and the Revelation lays my the pillar of fire appearing inv visibly Among Us identifying the messages right like he did on Mount Si oh this last day to see that same Pillar of Fire right Among Us speaking the same word not only that but interpret it by making it manifest and proving it it's the truth somebody shout back at me it's the truth the message is The Truth Listen notice the same P ofier that sent Moses and to Paul that wrote the Bible is now sent to reveal it come on Grace Tabernacle let's just say what a prophet said that's the grace of God that's the unchanging God fulfilling his promises of Matthew 28 Lord I'm with you always fulfill in John 14:12 the works I do you do also fulfill in Luke 1730 in the days when the son of man will be revealed see Malachi 4 behold I send you Elijah the prophet that will restore the faith of the people amen back to the original word what are you saying preacher I'm saying get your eyes off of a man and get your eyes on the Revelation and where the sh Glory lays come on you know why you're here on a Wednesday night is because you've gone beyond the outer Court you've gone beyond the inner Court you've gone into the holies of holies where the Shak glory is come on Church you all know the outer Court was controlled let me just slow down and say it to you like this the outer Court was controlled by the natural light so if the sun was and then God was blessing if there was no clouds in the sky brother Carter everything was okay but if you moved in the inner Court it was controlled by manl light because the priest had to light the candle to make sure there was light in there so in other words if you showed up in your favorite preacher wasn't preaching you didn't get your light lit you ready to go home but if you move over into the holies of holies if you move Bey on the beyond the outside light and you move be on the manl and you move over into the Eternal line it don't matter what's happening in the outer Court it don't matter if your favorite preacher here or not if the Shak glory is shining then there's a Revival in your soul there's a Hallelujah there's an amen on the inside of you oh Church of the Living God I say get out of Darkness we're not dependent on natural line we're not dependent on man-made line we have receive Messiah light the faith of God has become flesh in The Bride of Jesus Christ he said what is it it's the same light is come to what to manifest to make known to the people the promises he's made for this day listen friends it's the manifested light of the day brother Tom what is the message the manifested light can I say this to you the darkness is darkened that's a heavy one it's already dark brother Mark but now it gets darker the darkness has darkened y'all remember the story brother B tells he says there I was out there at the Statue of Liberty up there and and I hope I can have a little liberty here with this story for a second yes sir so there I was up there at the Statue of Liberty he said I guess I've told it here before I've seen those little old sparrows laying out around there and that big glass there with that old heads that old heads beat off little heads beat off I said to the guy I said 'w what then there he said 'w they had a storm last night and he said when the light was on the Statue of Liberty the little old birds called out there in the storm of darkness and instead of trying to use the light so you can have light but you got to use it instead of trying to use the light to fly to safety they flew against it see trying to beat it out now the very same light that caused them to die could have caused them to live if they would have used it right he said and they're laying there because their brains is beat out they tried to beat the light out accepted light and say thank you and let it lead them they tried to beat it out I said praise God he said infidels will rise and Creeds will rise and people will say the Bible's not right it's not inspired they're only beating their brains out when they could take it to Glory it's a lot it's a l to the path and to the people listen many man or woman who would accept God's word and say I may not understand it but Lord I'll walk it to the light now somebody say light use it right light that's good use it right it right can I just say this the message of the hour is light yes sir now I'm one of them Fanatics brother Bobby that just happens to believe them cloture light all right I'm just one of those guys that happens to believe it's light but you can have light but if you use it wrong come on church if you use it wrong you'll kill what you're what you're using it all and you all know we've seen it we've seen guys take Quotes come on now you now you got a quote we're a prophet of God he said something like this he said you see a woman with makeup on her face he said just say good morning Miss dog meat now I know that's a hard one to preach anymore but I'm still a go preacher and a message preacher I'm just going to go ahead and say it you know what a prophet of God said he said because God fed Jezebel to the dogs now that is light come on church it's light but preachers have taken it and every service just beat the people and beat the people y'all know what I'm talking about and then they take quotes on Holiness and just stand there and beat and beat and beat and beat listen those quotes are light but God didn't send light for us to beat the people with a light he sent the light to beat the de with it come on and brother said all them dead birds amen laying out there well I might as well just say it amen we've had a lot of young people laying around churches dead because men got to hold a lot and they used it

message don't even know what Prophet to CU we got a bunch of guys running around trying to get everybody to shout and dance amen and quit preaching the message you know what I say I say preach the shouting clotes and preach the repenting clotes and preach the forgiving quotes just preach the message as the light to the Gentiles to lead him to a [Applause] Rapture y'all know it's the truth and then you get on the other side and you got guys get up and say well that's a bunch of bubble dancing that's a let somebody get enough oh I'm going to get in trouble sure as the world let somebody get enough Liberty to shout and get enough Liberty to enjoy themselves in the house of God and here comes some old wet blanket and he's got a bunch of quotes and a bunch of Li and he stands there and starts beating well that's bubble dancing and don't jump no higher than you live listen we believe those quotes but pray tell me who left you in charge Amen to balance the Church of God the preaching of the message is the correcting of the church I say preach the message until the power of the Holy Ghost breaks Out Among the church and sets the church back in order again we don't need a man to do it we need somebody to listen the spirit listen to the spirit for once what you saying you know it's the truth take light and beat God's people with it you know what I'm talking about they'll take cloes one-sided cloaks and they're truth and they'll beat and beat and beat and beat beat and beat and beat and beat and then somebody tried to bring a Grace balance to it well you're just full of the world you're I'm done arguing I'm full of the Holy Ghost I heard what a prophet said you know what a prophet God said he said I pray identify myself this morning among God's people as a servant to help him show me where he said as a servant to beat him I can say something pretty straight right here I think I'll just go ahead and say it do you realize how far we've regressed we've gone all the way back amen I remember when I first started preaching as just a young man just a few short years ago amen studying the message listening to a prophet go in a pull pit and preach the third pull is the bride's Revival and it's in the bride and then get called out in the pastor's office and sit there for 30 minutes and Argan debate quot and it's the third pull in the bride is it the prophet hey but now amen we got to argue should we shout or should we not shout should we dance should we not should we have a good song or a slow song or fast song or a hot oh God you know what I say I say just go ahead and have church and get it out of your system and when you get done come back to the homeland of the church which is the message of the hour and serve god with everything that's within you if you want to shout shout if you want to dance dance if you want to cry cry if you want to run run but whatever you do just get out of tradition get out of the Shadows of legalism and man ideas and walk in the lights of the resurrection of Jesus Christ walk according to scripture preach the message the way the prophet preached you know what's the truth let our musicians come tonight hallu oh God don't let me beat against your light let me accept it in my heart and say it's right Lord yes sir I'll walk Amen in the light amen sure we'll walk in the light right not trying to beat it out not try to say well this is not right and this is wrong and that's right and that's not right and that's not then Birds could have tooken that light and searched it right out as it was moving down through there and went right on the nice Cove under some house somewhere in a shelter somewhere and had been protected from the storm the light was there their light had come good pre how are they going to use it come on Friends y'all know what I'm talking about this message is light amen can I get a witness the message of the hour is light and I'm a firm believer whatever a prophet taught on a scripture you read the scripture and read what he tght about it and that's light on that scripture I don't care what anybody says I don't care what a bishop says I don't care what an elder around this message says I don't care what anybody says if a prophet read the scripture and preached that's lick to that scripture I don't need you to rebalance it and reset it in order just say what he [Music] said are you hearing me tinkering with the message all right trying to trying to trying to get it to fit narratives and get it to fit agendas and listen friends the darkness is darkening amen it's happening right around the ranks of this message people say well I know brother B said that but he did but here's what it means because I'm going to just say what he said if he said the bride was smitten out of the lay out of sin AG just say [Music] it if he said there's a move of God and it's on that's th say the Lord then just say it if he said I pray we get so drunk on the holy ghost that we crow in tongues just say it if they say we need to get some order in the house of God just say it if he said we need to get out of order long enough to get saved just say it y'all know what I'm talking about church orders light it's a powerful tape but men have studied it just to beat people with it but you know what I say I say thank God in the last days there's a promise sister Joyce there's a bride going to rise up by the pure word she's going to rise up out of the confusion by the pure word she's going to leave what this man says and what that man says and what this man does and what this church thinks she going to leave it all behind and she's going to walk in the precious light of his resurrection listen friends I I told him over in George on Sunday I'll say it here I'm done arguing I don't care who says what who does what who goes where who goes I don't care give me the message of the hour it's in my heart and if you ever get this message in your heart somebody won't have to beg you to pray they won't have to beg you to read your Bible they won't have to beg you to live right and dress right if you get the message in your heart it'll walk through you every single day of your life what are you saying I'm saying this message is more than a book it's more than a tape it is light light has come to the Gentiles and it's time to walk in it yes sir if you ever get something in your heart am I feel it right there if you ever get something in your heart it don't matter what anybody says it don't matter what anybody does anybody thinks way anybody looks when it's in your heart you're walking with God unconscious of fear unconscious of criticism unconscious of what somebody thinks in the naysayers y'all know brother B said there was a woman named Miss Mr I think her name was Miss Mitchum Mitchell said she was a said he was talking to a preacher and he asked the preacher he said now sir he said do you think the joint down there had to the dance floor had to get her a sign of hard to come to the dance brother bam said no he said he said you know why he said no he said brother B asking he said do you think the the church or the the the the dance hall would have to get this woman to sign a card to agree to Come dance on Friday night man said no said you said he said you know why you said no he said why he said because it's in her heart he said dancing's in her heart and I got to study about that amen if it's in your heart event it's going to get out to you feet y'all know what I'm talking about amen you got a bitter heart and you try to hide it behind all kinds of fancy words and but eventually if it's in your heart it's going to make it to your lips well glory to God somebody shout amen you can only cover it up so long but if it's in your heart event it's going to come into manifestation said no he said cu the S heart you know what brother B said he said if she had to pwn her shoes to get to that dance she's going to be there you imagine pawning your shoes you got to pawn your own shoes to get money to get down there and dance and when you got down when you get down there you ain't even got no shoes on brother John but it's still in your heart so you dance on your bare feet well I feel good tonight you say what do you saying you know why I lay hands on the sick cuz it's in my heart you know why I believe in second chances because it's in my heart you know why I stand on platforms around this world and lift up this message as an absolute because it's in my heart you know why I believe an atmosphere will change anything because it's in my heart you know why I believe if somebody will just stand and say what a prophet said the angel of the Lord will come in the building cuz it's in my heart and if it's in my heart I want it to get to my lips I want it to get to somebody else's heart don't you stand your feet tonight [Applause] it's in my heart I can't help but anybody else does it's in my heart when God calls a man to do something and puts it in that man's heart and reveals it to him devil get out of the way there ain't nothing you can say nothing you can look no y'all know what I'm talking about it's in our heart it's in our heart to believe this word let the fight go let the argue go who's right who's wrong should it be said this way should it be done this way this church and that let it all go just love Jesus fellowship with his word some ask me one time they said how brother Andrew you as a Young Man kept on preaching after all them arguments over things brother BR taught you wouldn't back off of I said because it was in my heart and I know who come by my bedroom as a kid and put it in there the Lord Jesus Christ and there ain't nobody can take it out it's in the message of the hour friends how many say tonight Lord I want to use the light I want to use the light to get to Glory say this to you the lights you're [Music] uber the lights you're uber I've traveled around the world and gotten many Ubers and brother Matt I never one time got in it and check the old first I never got in it one time and that's the guy when the last time the spark plugs were changed and if he put a new battery in it recently and when's the last time you put new tires on this thing it's not my responsibility it's my ride the only thing I'm responsible to do is get in it and R out of there come on church and let me say this the message of the hour is your ride and it ain't up to you to check this and check that tie that amen just get in it and ride out of leosia ride out of the situation ride out of the depression ride out of the cond hey ride out of it it's a ride to Freedom it's a ride to Revival it's a ride to refreshing from the presence of the Lord I say get out of the confusion and get back in the light again and walk as a son of Light Fellowship with the Lord and his word do you love him tonight let's bow our hearts together almighty God we thank you Lord for this light we thank you for it Lord we know there's a great storm of formality coming lord it's already here your Prophet spoke at 1954 there's a great storm of indifference and denial of God it's already here your Prophet spoke it back then but oh God let us not be like those birds Lord let us not be like those who use the light to beat our brains out let us not be those Lord that use the light wrong oh God May the day never come that we start studying the message to correct somebody and argue and fuss brother bandam told us in the church age book lord your Prophet told us he said in the last days the only thing the church will get down to is a weapon of argument and Lord we see it all around us lord it's in politics Lord It's the spirit of the age argue this argue that argue this Lord argue this point argue that then it moves into education moves into religion Lord just because we're in the word and we're walking in the light don't mean we're exempt from the pressures of it Lord we walk in a land that's covered in the shadow father of confusion and arguments that Lord ask for me in our in my house as your Prophet said we're going to serve the word we're going to serve the word now father I pray tonight Lord I pray someone here tonight will turn on the light I pray Lord they'll go home and change the atmosphere around them oh god father if there be one here tonight that's laying and they've got bruises spiritually father hurts in their Spirit hurts in their in their in their lives maybe maybe someone used quotes to beat them and use the beautiful light of your Resurrection Lord as your Prophet said it come in the evening time and they've used it to try to condemn and tear down father I've seen it before Lord many a few years ago a sister there in North Carolina Lord served you for many many years but years ago Lord someone used some quotes and scriptures and really put her under a condemnation and Lord she kept going to church but that Sunday morning I was speaking on Liberty and Lord your spirit just moved across me and I said the message didn't do it to you what someone did with the message did Lord you you're my witness you received the Deliverance right there she come to me afterwards she said brother Andrew she said I've been ready to walk away from this message for years she began to tell me what happened she said but this morning I realized it wasn't the message that did this to me it's what someone did with it oh God help us Lord help us as preachers father help us as parents Lord Sunday school teachers leaders Among Us oh God help us help us to take this light Lord and use it in the right way Lord help us if we see someone struggling give us the grace to take this light to him Lord maybe they're struggling and we take that quote of light where brother brandham said what do you struggling for so you can live what are you living for so you can die wouldn't it be most foolish not to accept Jesus Christ oh God and just saying that to someone can turn light on in their life because it is light help us Lord help us Lord prophet of God said oh God don't let me try to beat that light out let me use it to walk in I believe it Lord there you are walk in the light as I see it in the scripture that's light it's God's word now let me walk in it Lord Lord Lord let me walk in it never never try to deny it let me walk in it Hallelujah every headbow every eye closed maybe tonight you just raise your hands before the Lord say Lord remember me help me Lord help me father I want to walk in light I want to lead by light Lord give me the grace give me the grace to use this light right hallelujah hallelujah amen and amen you love him tonight you know the prophet of God tells us he said if you go in a room and it's real dark he said there's all kinds of roaches and mice and bugs he said creeping crawling things he said just turn on the light R he said when that light comes on he said them roaches will scatter he said because they're scared of light he said just flip the light on you know what that that habitat is it's dark and they love Darkness they love that environment they love that feeling they don't want no light they want it dark and cold and whatever creepy feeling they want in there that's that's the atmosphere they dwell in but when you turn the light on the light changes their atmosphere and it don't even ask them if it wants to be changed the light don't stop and say hey there Mr spider do you want the atmosphere to change just flip the light on and the I didn't have time to get to it the light forces it forces the darkness out and the prophet of God said them things go to scattered brother Morgan you don't have to go chasing them and stomping get out of here go get out of here just turn on the light but light will push them out you know what I say I say has the devil moved in your home has the devil found a good place there I say go home tonight and turn on a tape I say go home

walking in the life that God has given Amen brother B said there ain't no Creed denomination Pope or priest or doctor Divinity an organization no Nation no nothing that could ever put out the manifestation of the light of God and when the word of God is spoke she comes to the light we can't do nothing but walk in it the world can't stand in it the the the things of the world can't stand in it but the bride she can walk in it you believe that tonight I believe we have a right to walk in the light of the word of God maybe you don't see it all at once you know that's what that's what the Bible said he said my word will be a light unto thy feet and a lamp unto thy path a lamp unto thy feet you know sometimes it don't show a far off brother Jared sometimes it ain't it ain't five years down the road and that's what we want because we're a we're a busy people we want everything to be shown to us all at once but sometimes God just shows you a next step to take you remember the story of the old man that was trying to go home and the GU came out of the meeting and they asked him where he live he said I live just over the hill he said well how he said well well where you can't see your house he said no I can't see it from here remember he was challenging the the preaching well I just don't know if I can believe that I I don't know if I can accept that he said you know Jesus is a lie to us he said well I can't believe in heaven cuz I can't see it you know it's something that's just so far off it's hard for me to grasp it he said well do you live here he said I live over the hill he said can you see your house from here well no I can't see it you got to go through those woods and over a couple Hills before you can actually see it he said but I believe you you say it's there he said he said well if you can't see your house well how can you ever find it he said well I have a lamp he said well if you hold that lamp up real bright can you see the house with the lamp well no I can't see it he said well what do you see with the lamp he said it just shows me the path in front of me he said every step that I take is illuminated by the lamp that I have in my hand isn't that the way it is with serving God you may not see the end of the road you may not see the the big picture always but brother Jared I believe if you'll hold that lamp that God has given us then every step you take will be illuminated we're not walking in darkness we're walking in light do you believe that tonight amen let's just sing it before we go well Jesus is the light of the world oh we
