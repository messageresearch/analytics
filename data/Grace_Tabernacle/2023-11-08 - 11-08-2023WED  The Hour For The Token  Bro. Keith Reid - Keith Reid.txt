seated just for a while meeting your pastor for the first time I've heard have him and um mightbe some of you have heard of me amen but um it's good to be together with God's people because one thing we know for certain that the people who are here is the same ones we're going to spend eternity with amen and um you know we might come from different countries we have different accent we speak different language but we are one people we are the people of God Amen and there's one thing that bring us together it's not because of who we are but because of who he is amen we certainly thank God for the message of the hour I've met people who under normal circumstance there was no way our path should have crossed but because of God's grace amen and what he has done in this hour we've got one thing in common God has sent a prophet and we are the recipient of that voice of that seventh angel messenger amen so we greet you from our church spoken word Apostolic Tabernacle in lindstad Jamaica and from the ministers who are there both in our local church and those that are on the island Jamaica if you look on the map to see where Jamaica is you might miss it because it's just a little spot amen but when you get there you realize the spot is it doesn't look like a spot when you're standing there amen but we we're glad for amen the privilege to travel and to meet others and to share amen and my precious brother Joe reyolds who has been in our home and in our church and he's a mighty preacher amen and I I've got a chance of meeting Mighty Men of God in this time amen I thank God for the call I came around the message just about 1980 uh when I was still in high school and um you know got hooked on it in 1985 when I got baptized by Brother Thomas Brady who had been around for so long the church day was established in the 60s but um a newcomer to all of that I never grew up in the message I grew up as a Baptist you know and we had a certain way and um Sometimes some of the ways of the people around the message I'm not catching to it because of my background but one thing I certainly know I love the people of God Amen I am not a fighter I a lover of the people amen and you know like they said sometimes they make a circle and they exclude you I just make a bigger Circle and ex include amen praise God because I can't determine who is going to make it and I'm not here to preach for those who not going to make it so I just preachers know everybody is going to make it amen I realize one thing this is not my bride this is Christ's bride and I'm really privileged to be able to speak to her uh think of it that God could have chosen any medium but God has chosen us Amen to prepare that bride for that Rapture and so I'm glad to have my wife traveling with me we have two daughters and um they are grown you know um they're no longer children they're now living in Canada so we kind of live alone amen praise God but we we thank God for all things and um we want to look at the word of God tonight I realize that this church is a very young church amen started just a few years ago amen but I thank God for amen when you started you feel the fire Amen to press on you know I I realized they said this was a little Barn there and so but I look at the beautiful assemble that you have put together amen because you have your heart in all of that and may God bless you amen and may you stay strong and may God send others of like Precious Faith to worship god with you am amen I believe that there was a message for yesterday and there's a message for today amen I believe that you know brother Brandon was here and people said that well if we were back there when the prophet was here what it would have been I believe that this is a greater day because we are closer to our Redemption than we were yesterday and many that was back then and they sit and they heard the message preached back then they had no understanding of what was happening but today there's a greater light that is shining Among Us amen and uh uh we are young and we have never seen the days of the prophet and we have never met the man but hallelujah we're going to carry on the fire until Jesus appear amen praise God so stand on your feet um I'd like you to turn your Bibles to AGI chapter 2 or you call it it ay I don't know the way you pronounce it amen but chapter 2 this was the returning to Zion and the rebuilding of the temple under zerubabel and Ezra and nemiah each had their portion to do what a great template was when Solomon had built it and dedicated and the glory of the Lord came down but when it was fall in ruin and it was to be reestablished you know it speaks of the Endtime bride coming in preview of the word of God and the portion that we are to take you know we're here for a purpose don't let nobody fool you amen we're here for a purpose and the purpose of the Bride today is greater than those of our forefathers that forrun us really with the message of the hour so let's just bow our heads as we look to the word of God tonight our gracious God and our father Lord we thank you God for this privilege you have given to us to come into your house and Lord God for such a time like this Lord God we pray that oh God you would send the anointing ing tonight God the power of the Holy Spirit Lord God May the H time token Speak oh God lord and may we understand that Lord God we are here for a great time with you because Lord God you're placing us positionally in your word bless Lord God our pastor and the ministers that serve and the people oh God who have given their labor to the the word of God father we pray that Lord God You' continue to bless and anoint and energize them oh God keep them ined by Your Word but father we pray that oh God those lips that would speak tonight and those hearers that would hear may you anoint it oh God remember those that are without Lord God and the downcast and Lord God those Spirit who have been broken Lord God we pray that you rise Us by your word and we'll give you the preeminence that's due unto your name in Jesus Christ's name we pray amen and amen in Chapter 2 and verse three I will read who is left among you that saw the house in her first glory and how do you see it now it is not in your eyes in comparison of as nothing yet now be strong o zerubabel said the Lord and be strong o Joshua son of jzc the high priest and be strong ye people of the land said the Lord and work for I Am with You said the Lord of H in verse 7 it says and I will shake all NE Nations and the desire of all Nations shall come and I will fill the house with Glory said the Lord of hes the silver is man and the gold is man said the Lord of OES the glory of this latter house shall be greater than that of the former said the Lord of hes and in this place will I give peace said the Lord of host may the Lord that his Blessing reading of the word tonight I'd like to speak on the how for the token you know in the first Exodus the token was required in other words they could not move forward without the token I read from the message toen 1963 brother BM said it's been the lamb all the way through it was a lamb in Luther's time it was the lamb in Wesley time but now is token time that each house must be covered by the token Hallelujah each house of God must be covered by the token and all that's inside of it must be covered by the token and the house of God is a body of Jesus Christ aren't you in it tonight and by one Spirit we're all baptized into the token because am me become part of it that God said when I see the token display Hallelujah I will pass over you and he said what an hour that we're in now what an hour the hour of the token you know hear it was let me take it back from the time of uh Egypt when they were under captivity by Pharaoh but God had a promise in that people and if God say it's got to come to pass I don't care what happened if God say itth you can rest upon that word uh because that word cannot fail is a right amen and here it is they come to a time where Hallelujah you can imagine they get complacent in the things that are happening around them but God was not complacent God knows the hour the moment he's going to move them out hallelujah amen here it is uh we can look back at the old Patriarchs of all amen like Ezra who was a priest on Amen I love the story of nemiah the king CA Hallelujah he was there and you know as they go back to Jerusalem they were given leave on daryus the king to amen go back into the land of Zion and and see how it is and amen the walls of Zion had broken down and amen there was a mixed multitude amen walking over in Jerusalem and amen by their genealogy amen they never bear Hebrew names because uh am mean they were mixing with the itats and the jebat and am mean and all of that and am mean there was a drifting away from uh amen the central part of what God gave to them amen but there there was that day when oh the king gave them leave uh you can go back into your Homeland uh amen and you know there was those who were Prosper amen there and they amen they stayed in the land they were comfortable amen but they were like Ezra amen and zeruel and amen nemiah amen they went over to see the land and amen hear this word the word of hegi that God gave him amen and he be to amen Wonder among the people he said who are among you amen that see the days of the Prophet uh amen that were in the meetings of Jeff sville Indiana amen had traveled through with the prophets and amen heard him preach and see amen all the Miracles and the signs uh amen there what a great day that was uh he said and I'll compare you with today amen it was a vision amen that AI had from God uh amen that the day that we're living is a great day hallelujah amen you think that that day was great but what about this day that we're in today uh amen God uh amen is going to rise up young men young people amen with a fire of almighty God uh amen when our fathers of yesterday uh when theyve testified and testified uh amen until we have heard it we have heard it we have heard it uhen and there was nothing more to it uh amen there's a fire of God that was amen rising up in the last day there uh and tell them go back to your land uh amen reestablish Temple worship uh amen this the hour amen God call you amen for a purpose uh and for that purpose you are here you got to realize tonight uhen even around the message of the hour we've seen many drifting off uh amen many Falling Away uh amen but this is the greatest day uh amen that you have ever seen uh where the word of God is coming into Power amen we're not dwelling on the essence of yesterday amen though those things were good uh amen but there's a greater reality uh amen that we are in today uh amen that God is preparing us uh amen not for a long haul uh amen but there must be a quick uh powerful message uh to sweep across the Brad uh am me to lift up us uh am me into the Mount Zion Rapture Showdown Hallelujah am me you know sometimes we we get to the stage uh amen we become complacent uh amen having all the mechanics uh amen yes the people dress right uh amen there's no mixed mask Mar you don't cut your hair amen and all these things we baptize uh in the name of the Lord Jesus uh amen and we're just message people amen we believe that God sent us a prophet uh amen and he has gone off the scene uh amen and we continue just like that uh amen but I want to tell you the prophet said uh in that message why Christ speak uh he said no church uh in its practice no matter fundamental or intellectual that church might be he said that church cannot strive until the Supernatural is made known among the people amen and I want to bring you up to that spot tonight uh amen that we're not just a church uh for the mechanics uh but we are a church for the dynamic power of the Holy Ghost uh are you there with somebody amen and for this reason the prophet preach uh amen the statue of a perfect man uh amen yes you came into the body of Christ uh amen by your faith uh amen many of you have been here for so long uh you said this not what I was expecting amen but that's where I am now but God is calling us to order amen that he call us for a purpose uh amen not just that we are Justified uh or that we are Sanctified uh amen but that I know that I've bet uh amen the pillar of fire that may I say to you tonight uh it doesn't matter where you are who you are uh you cannot really fulfill uh amen God's purpose uh until the supernatural power of the Holy Ghost uh amen come and dwell within your heart uh amen sometimes we take uh amen a mental conception uh of the Holy Ghost oh do you believe uh amen that brother brand is a prophet oh yes I believe uh amen oh yes my children believe uh amen they are filled with the Holy Ghost uh amen for they believe the message but it takes more than that is that right uh it takes an Awakening uh it takes a fire amen of God not a painted fire of yesterday uh amen but something today amen that is real uh amen I want a more of God uh in my heart today uh and if there's a more of God uh amen that I can cry to me there's a more of God for me to receive uh am mean what it is uh it's a deep calling uh unto a deep uh and if a deep call uh there's got to be a deep to respond uh are you there with me uh amen I just don't want an anointing uh amen I just don't want a feeling uh I just don't want an head knowledge uh amen that I've read the book uh I can quote the quotes uh no sir but I need uh amen the real Jesus Christ uh amen coming down uh and dwelling inside of me [Applause] hallelujah amen brother Bram said that God brings individual through the same process that he brings a church and the church all to the Gentiles it started with the church of Ephesus himen and Smur and pergamus and all that me he said the last three Church age uh it forms a complete birth justification under lther sanctification under Wesley and the baptism of the Holy Ghost uh am me came with the restoration uh of the gifts back into the church now may I say it like this uh amen we have gotone to the stage today where amen we go to a message church and if somebody shout amen everybody turn around and look uh because that's a strange phenomena amen that the spirit of of God move Among Us uh amen but we are the church again uh where God's going to restore uh amen the word of wisdom the word of knowledge uh amen prophecy tongues uh are you afraid of it uh it's going to be here because God put the gifts in the church uh am to keep the church in order amen by his word uh are you there Glory Hallelujah a and you're going to get to the stage uh amen when that Supernatural power of Jesus Christ begin to move uh amen you just can't Ain yourself uh you forget the order amen that you fall under because there's something inside of you amen crying out uh Hallelujah Lord God I want more of you am me we've got to come to that stage uh me where the supernatural uh is made known uh amen where there's crying uh amen not because somebody beat on you but because inside of you amen there is something crying out uh amen for a more of God uh amen the essence to know uh and the enthusiasm uh me to be at that place uh where God is calling us uh am me to harder again oh hallelujah oh in investment he said and then that word in you produce the life of Jesus Christ is that right it can't produce anything else amen it could take the life uh amen out of the pet tree and put itth Amen in a pair he said it's going to Bear pear amen you could take uh amen a Hallelujah the life out of a peer tree and put it in something it's going to be it's going to produce what's inside of itth he said the life that's in you shows uh who you are the life that's in you it's showing who you are am me your life testifies so loud in you until your testimony amen is not heard uh amen they knew what you are by the life you live uh H by

that they should receive the Holy Ghost uh amen and if the people didn't receive the Holy Ghost uh he me they wouldn't believe the message but believing the message or say you believe the message is not the baptism of the Holy Ghost the baptism of the Holy Ghost is an experience with God hallelujah you got to have an experience with God hallelujah St John 4:23 and 24 St John 4:23 and 24 but the how cometh and now is when the true worshippers shall worship the father in spirit and in truth for the father father he get such to worship him God is a spirit and they that worship Him must worship

why we have so much problem because men are in the Pulpit without the Holy Ghost deacons are there without the Holy Ghost Elders are counseling without the Holy Ghost cuz they have never met the fire of God is is that right yes sir amen what shall we do with this Jesus that is called Christ he said God's body United as his brde being one him and Christ together is a spirit working in the flesh of the church like it work in the flesh of Jesus Christ cuz it is part of his body not Twain but one they are one a husband and his wife is no no longer two but one and Christ and his body is one and the Same Spirit was in Christ is in the bride in in his body that unites them together with all the word and God's living in there himself manifesting it you know I've always say it like this the way a man treats his wife is his revelation of how he see God you know when eleasa went to call Rebecca elazer Never Tell Rebecca about himself Rebecca never fall in love with Eleazar there's people around the message today you know what they're in love with the relics of the message God sent a prophet that's the truth the Miracles the sign the Wonders that's what they love you know some years ago we had a brother in church and when I was just bringing them to the message when he take a message book he didn't read so much of the message he he he went after brother Brandon had finished reading the message and went into the healing service and that was the only part of the book that he read because that's the only part that appealed to him you see that don't put you in the message no because signs and wonders catch the unbeliever but the message of the hour will positionally place the believer in Jesus Christ amen hallelujah when brother Brandon went until 1962 December he preached sir is this a sign of the time and he begin to look at the signs or or you know the the the the things that has been revealed back into the church what he was doing he was bringing a summation of the son of man Ministry amen but in February you were when that light was that eye cloud had appear am me God sent him back to preach the opening of the word brother brandom said it's not in the years of preparation but when he begins to preach his message for the church a book he said the Prophet come to do two things according to Malachi 4 to turn the art of the children back to the apostolic fathers that's one that's Malachi 4 but according to Revelation 10:7 to Hallelujah to reveal the Mysteries that are contained within the Seven Seals and the Mysteries contained within the Seven Seals is the Hallelujah the seven Thunders which because somebody and encroach Upon Our Land and preach the seven tunders the seven virtue which the prophet never preached people are afraid of those words but the very thing that will bring the briad into maturity it stands on the outside because and C crows are up on our land but Brethren listen am mean restore the fate of the fathers that's good Pentecost had believe that but there's a message to take a bride to a Rapture so brother BR went and he preach Christ The Mystery of God revealed Hallelujah he said if there was anything that was inspired that was it because he now preached the very mind of God to the people that God want to reveal himself completely in Jesus Christ that Christ might have preeminence and if Christ don't don't have preeminence he could never restore us back to heeden as if there is no fall so he said page 33 Christ The Mystery of God reveal he said and what is the Holy Ghost then which we call the token in the last day what is the Holy Ghost he said it's the revelation of Jesus Christ personally to you not to the pastor not to the preacher personally to you children of God we need to feed on the word of God until we become that word amen amen we've got to come to that place where as we read the word and the word becomes real uh and me the word that s there for age step from the page uh and step into a body then we can say the word has made flesh again hallelujah what is it we need Perfection sir full maturity the baptism of the Holy Ghost making way for the Holy Ghost himself adoption the Bible says that we are predestinated unto the adoption of sons is a rot hallelujah amen you know there were some things which were accepted in Jesus ministry amen you know it said John two he turned the water into one that was accepted they say you left the best wine for the last Amen in St John Hallelujah for he Hallelujah discern the thoughts of the heart of the woman of Samaria amen the man came they see they hear of Jesus but he said John 6 when he said except you heed the Flesh of the son of man and drink his blood you have no life in you the Bible said many walk no more with him but that's when the message to the bride just begin Hallelujah Amen in brother Brandon's Ministry it was healing then it was the Discerning of the thoughts of the heart but when it comes to the opening of the word the word made flesh people tell you oh just keep it simple how much simple can it be that Jesus Christ been revealed in the heart of his children hallelujah amen you know from where God brought you from to where he taking you let me tell you it's going to take a metamorphosis it's not going to be who you are but it's going to be what God wants you to be and if God going to cause a metamorphosis in your life there's got to be an Amidon because he's going to destroy everything that you are to bring you in the image of himself you know some of us should look through the path of life amen and see the the way that God is going to bring us uh Amen to bring us to Perfection we would start to cry out please Lord no Lord don't do it but he let me walk the roads of this appointment and he knows what's best for me sometimes he's going to destroy who you are to get you to be what he wants you to be Hallelujah Paul said and for the glory glory of the Revelation I misquote I I quote hallelujah requote what he said for the glory of the Revelation that is given to me God give to me the messenger of Satan to Buffet me Paul said I had a Tor In the Flesh what was it is to remind him that you are human but out of you come the glory of almighty God it's not who you are it's not the sign that you're B under but it's a glory that God want to bring you to and how is God going to do it he's going to destroy who you are so when we think of it the Walk of the believer I say it like this bear with me justification sanctification the baptism of the Holy Ghost is your faith that brings you into the body of Christ there's never a Christian without faith in God is that right virtue Temperance knowledge patience God's Not Just bu the Bible said an add to it but how do we had to it brother in order for God to move us from one level to the other he's going to destroy everything that we are bring us into who he is oh you know look at the seals the first four seal it reveal the Antichrist name Deb but in the Sixth Seal is an armagideon a judgment seal he a r because if you don't have a judgment you will never have your seventh seal he come comes to me is that right you'll never have a revelation 81 amen the six seal is the interruption of your nature to bring you into the seventh seal then Revelation 81 silence in heaven you know why there had to be silence in heaven because he came to me brother when God is revealed in this bride not even the angels in heaven would believe that God could bring a nature of himself out of this generation but Brethren it's not because of who we are it's because of who he is this is the hour for the token Hallelujah if the token is not on display he said then the Covenant is a null what do I need to make it I need the Holy Ghost Hallelujah but the holy ghost in the last day he said it's the token it's required price for the journey not me him not who I was but who he is hallelujah and Brethren let me tell you he might meanders you he might take you through stages of life but God wants some spiritual astronauts in this day amen he's going to take your places that you've never been before are you there with me but all of that is because he loves you oh let me close here somewhere hallelujah amen in investment brother Bram said as I said in the message if Boven was in you you would have do the work of Boven you would have lived the life of biten you would have do nothing else you could do nothing else but compose songs and if you'd be a great writer CU he is in you that's who you would be you would be an incarnation of bethoven and if Christ is in you the Life of Christ you will be you believe that amen the love of the word nothing can stand and take the place of the word cuz he is the word he can't deny his own word and still remain God as the musicians come now he can't deny his own word and still be God so the falling apart falling apart of the world he said now anything that pulls you away from that word is wrong sir that is wrong that's a false Messiah a false anointing sir oh he said the brother had just had such an anointing what kind of anointing that's it Hitler had an anointing too he said goov had one also poay had one also what kind of anointing you've got if it's not Anointed with the word and vindicate every word to be the truth he said leave leave it alone amen the bride will have the word like it was in Mary Mary carried the word hallelujah and in order to carry that word she had to deny her own intellect when the angel of the Lord come to her she said how can these things be for I never know a man you begin to say the Holy Ghost will overshadow you and that only thing that will be form inside of you will be called the son of the highest hallelujah amen listen brethren in Galatians 2:19 stand on your feet for I through the law am dead to the law that I might live unto God he said I am crucified with Christ never N thess I live yet not I but Christ who liveth in me and the life which I know Live In the Flesh I live by the faith of the Son of God who loved me and gave himself for me who are you tonight you are the love of Jesus Christ being manifested upon the face of the Earth and if at work you don't display that come up a little higher if it's cool you don't display that come up a little higher if in your business you don't display that come up a little higher because the bride in order to live out of here we've got to display the life of Jesus Christ amen nothing else you know I see Brothers sometimes they try to hold their Bible like the prophet they try to wear something that the prophet wear they try to do the things the prophet did you don't have to be a copycat because Jesus Christ is the original amen don't fall in love with elasa fall in love with your Isaac Jesus Christ because I'm in love with him that's why I read the word of God that's why I study the message of the that's why I listen the message of the I want to become more like my Isaac you said ah they said oh but we we've got the Bible all these years but we were blind we were walking in darkness but God sent the seventh angel Messenger to open your eyes so we can say tonight blessed are your eyes for they see blessed are your ears for they hear blessed will be the walk that you walk on the face of the Earth again for Jesus Christ will be manifest on the face of the Earth one more time you believe that and Lord if there's anything you're doing in this hour let me be part of it let me be part of it let me reflect the life of Jesus Christ for it's the how of the token amen the token must be on display he said what is that token the literal life of Jesus Christ upon the believer may we bow our heads everywhere Hallelujah

your word be born in the manger of my heart let it live in me let it St live inside this house of clay and mold me every day let your word be born in the manger of my heart I say outwardly I'm nothing not much to behold unlikely a place for his word to unfold but if I'll just yield this vessel and let him have his way from Glory unto Glory he'll change me day by day let your word be born in the manger of my heart let it live in me let it St live inside this house of clay and mold me every day let your word be born in the manger of my heart amen is that your prayer tonight amen how many you say the Lord spoke to your heart tonight amen the hour of the token I think God's trying to tell us something and I I know brother Keith hadn't this is the first time he's here so I know he hadn't been here the last two Sundays so it's first time is this first time y'all saw him and but uh if he didn't come in start speaking about the token and and I don't know if y'all remember this Sunday morning but uh we had spoke to preached on it the last Sunday and spoke on it the first the next Sunday of how important it was to display the token remember when Rahab went in and she took what had changed in her life and she displayed it and and I believe that's what God is calling the bride to do is to display the token amen friends I I I really believe it the display of the token is a Vindication that you received the message that the preacher was preaching amen that's what message was brought to her it's a Vindication that she received the message amen I I thank God that we have people today that have that displaying in their life the very life of Jesus Christ displaying in you it's just there's nothing less than that that's the call of God in this hour is to display the very life of Jesus Christ and I sure appreciate our brother and just pouring out his heart and and is going to be around with us for a few days and I know we have the um the uh uh what are we the festival the Fall Festival on Saturday and uh and so look forward to that and I know a lot of the sisters that are come together to help make that happen sure appreciate that and and uh and the brothers doing some some labor and and I thank I thank God for a good brother that comes in there and talks about doing the work of the Lord amen I think sometimes people forget that doing the Lord's work takes work but you know it takes work and sometimes it just you have to fight through things and we have to struggle through feelings and problems that we're going through at work and and family trouble and all this we have to fight through that to do the Lord's work it takes work but I believe that God has called us to it and if he and he gave you the strength isn't that something the brother said he said the he quoted that scripture he said that the people that know their God shall be strong the Bible called for us to be strong in work and if you don't have the strength to do the work of the lord well know your God it gives you it gives you strength strength amen the people that know their God shall be strong I just uh just look forward to uh the weekend and all that God has in store for us so uh maybe I just want to encourage you to invite friends and family and and those out to to the festival and I know we're um you know it's a time of fellowship and enjoyment but uh there's nothing that are done on these grounds that aren't for the purpose of the furtherance of the Gospel so in our fun and our enjoyment it'll be a an opportunity maybe to uh meet some people that we haven't met and so uh that's that's what I that's what I see in it anyway so uh just a time of fellowship with one another and maybe uh bring some people out and let them just enjoy a good Christian good clean Christian fun and uh just to be around the saints of God Amen and how many's looking forward to that amen so I think brother they they they've done uh uh bride brother Keith in being one of the judges uh for the for the for the Chile contest so uh I I have to to be fair I'm just a person of fairness I have to disclose something that I heard today and and in order to be fair because I'm the only one that heard it and I I may have said it to one of the people that are that are cooking chili and so I have to make sure I disclose it to all the rest of the people that are cooking chili brother Keith said he's not he don't really like spice so I can't tell that to one person that's making chili and then the others make theirs real spicy so I there I said it to all of you and uh I'm not good with keeping keeping all them kind of secret so there's one of the judges that don't that don't like spice so I don't know about the others I don't know who the other judges are U but The Others May like spice so I I don't know but uh we just we just uh we just look forward to a good time in the Lord how many's looking forward to that amen and and I think that's I think we ought to we have a right as a body of Believers to come together and have fellowship and and uh we we come to church to Fellowship around the word and we're going to we're going to come out Saturday and just have wonderful Christian Fellowship amen you love the Lord tonight won't you to turn around and and tell somebody you love them and it's good to be in the house of the Lord with you and I think the brothers they
