[44:02] would anoint me Father speak through
[44:03] these lips of clay Lord and speak to the
[44:05] hearts God lord I ask that you would
[44:07] anoint the congregation father may they
[44:10] also come under the same inspiration
[44:11] Lord and receive what you have for us
[44:13] tonight we ask these things in your
[44:15] precious name amen you may be seated
[44:18] this evening uh my title tonight would
[44:21] be a positive token to something really
[44:23] simple but I pray it can it can bless
[44:25] each and every one of us say amen but
[44:27] brother Brandon would tell us that we
[44:29] live off of dead substance you know what
[44:31] if we if we eat something it had to die
[44:34] before you can eat a hamburger the cow
[44:36] had to die you know before you can eat
[44:38] before you can eat bacon for breakfast
[44:40] the pig had to die and he would say even
[44:42] for your vegetarians you know he says
[44:44] the vegetable had to Die the the fruit
[44:46] had to die or the bacteria of the milk
[44:49] it had to die so whatever we live off of
[44:52] naturally had to die in order for us to
[44:55] live and he would tell us the same thing
[44:57] spiritually in order for us to be alive
[44:59] spiritually something had to die and we
[45:02] would see through the Old Testament that
[45:03] they would come to the Tabernacle and
[45:05] would slay a lamb and the blood of that
[45:07] lamb would pour over them and it would
[45:10] bring a forgiveness of their sins you
[45:12] know but there was no separation from
[45:15] their sin just a forgiveness it was a
[45:17] cycle they would come to the Tabernacle
[45:19] for maybe telling a lie or for having a
[45:22] a bad thought or being jealous or a
[45:25] gossiping Spirit whatever it would be
[45:27] they would say Lord forgive me the blood
[45:29] would pour on them but they would leave
[45:31] that with that sin still connected with
[45:33] them there was no remission under the
[45:35] blood of bulls and goats there was they
[45:37] were under a cycle every year they' come
[45:39] and slay a lamb for the same sin slay a
[45:42] lamb for the same sin you know the Bible
[45:44] would tell us in Hebrews 10:1 for the
[45:47] law having a shadow of good things to
[45:49] come not the very image of the things
[45:52] can never with those sacrifices which
[45:54] they offered year by year can
[45:57] continually make the comers there unto
[45:59] perfect so so when the blood of Christ
[46:02] would come it would not just forgive you
[46:04] but it would bring a remission and the
[46:07] word remission means separated released
[46:09] from prison or bondage and so the blood
[46:12] of Christ would break the cycle where
[46:14] you wouldn't just come on a on a on a
[46:16] Wednesday night saying God forgive me
[46:18] for this next Wednesday God forgive me
[46:20] for this a year from now you're
[46:22] struggling with the same thing it was a
[46:24] remission a separation of uh from the
[46:27] very nature that the blood of bulls and
[46:30] goats could not take away from you and I
[46:32] like how the Bible would tell under the
[46:34] blood of bulls and goats there's a
[46:36] remembrance made for sin every year but
[46:39] under the blood of Christ the Bible
[46:41] would say this because that the
[46:43] worshippers once purged should have no
[46:45] more conscience of sin so under the Old
[46:48] Testament there was a remembrance of sin
[46:51] the conscience the desire of sin was
[46:54] there but under the blood of Christ not
[46:56] a cycle but once purged there was no
[46:59] more desire no more conscience of sin so
[47:02] I believe leing today not in a cycle but
[47:05] we're living in a liberty that the blood
[47:08] of Christ has brought us but you see it
[47:10] wasn't the literal blood of Jesus but it
[47:13] was the life of the blood that would
[47:15] that's what would bring the remission
[47:17] cuz if you don't get the life of the
[47:18] blood you're in the same cycle we can
[47:21] say we got the blood we got the blood
[47:22] but there's a life behind the blood
[47:24] there's a life that can come and bring
[47:27] remission and brother Brandon would tell
[47:29] us what would he do if he had two drops
[47:32] of the blood of Jesus you know and he
[47:34] would say I would walk so careful with
[47:35] it if I had it in a cup I would walk so
[47:38] careful so reverently that I would not
[47:41] spill those drops of blood but he says
[47:43] there's more something more important in
[47:45] front of me than the literal blood of
[47:48] Jesus it's the purchase of the blood of
[47:50] Jesus so we don't got the literal blood
[47:53] of Jesus today but we've got the
[47:55] purchased product we've up the life of
[47:57] the blood not the chemical there's a
[48:00] life that has brought us out of the
[48:02] negative and taken us into a positive
[48:05] because brother brandom you know would
[48:06] would tell us what what what what what
[48:08] did the blood do he would say when the
[48:10] blood of Christ the blood cell was broke
[48:13] he says it would release God and so the
[48:16] Cru the cross is more than a crucifix
[48:18] the blood is more than a chemical but it
[48:21] was releasing of deity to come inside of
[48:24] humanity that were in cycles that would
[48:26] come inside of humanity that could not
[48:29] get past the sin nature and would
[48:31] release a nature would release God
[48:34] inside of a young person inside of a
[48:36] marriage inside of a daddy and bring a
[48:38] remission and so the blood of Christ
[48:41] would bring more than a forgiveness the
[48:43] Bible would tell us in Hebrews 10:1 17
[48:46] and their sins and iniquities will I
[48:48] remember no more I'm not just going to
[48:51] forgive you but when I look at you
[48:53] you're separated from the sins that you
[48:56] would come in oh Hallelujah so when God
[48:58] looks at a young person he don't see
[49:01] Cycles when God looks at a young person
[49:03] he don't see failures he don't see past
[49:05] mistakes he sees a remission he sees a
[49:08] separation not a cycle but a separation
[49:12] oh Hallelujah brother Brandon would say
[49:14] when he looks at you all he hears is
[49:16] your voice but he sees or but he sees
[49:19] your representation which is the blood
[49:21] of Christ so when God looks at you all
[49:24] he sees is his blood you know brother
[49:26] the Brandon would say you'll never be
[49:28] perfect in my sight and I'll never be
[49:30] perfect in your sight but he says what
[49:32] about God's sight oh my you may see
[49:35] mistakes you may see failures you may
[49:37] see flaws but what does God see when God
[49:39] looks at your brother he sees the blood
[49:42] he don't see complexes and I'm so
[49:44] thankful cuz when God looks at me
[49:46] there's plenty of faults he can point to
[49:48] but he don't see the faults he don't see
[49:50] the mistakes he sees the blood and you
[49:53] may feel like you're in a cycle tonight
[49:56] but there's a blood this evening that
[49:58] has brought a remission where when God
[50:00] looks at you he sees the blood of Christ
[50:03] oh Hallelujah you know the Bible would
[50:05] tell us in Romans for the remission of
[50:08] sins that are passed you know so that
[50:10] that's many things or you know that's
[50:12] many sins that the Bible's talking about
[50:14] for the remission of sins that are
[50:17] passed because that's many many people
[50:19] struggle with things that they used to
[50:21] do right I used to do this the the the
[50:23] Devil comes with condemnation says you
[50:25] know what you did yesterday you know
[50:27] what you did 20 years ago and they can't
[50:29] get past the condemnation so the blood
[50:31] did not just bring a remission of sins
[50:34] today or of tomorrow but he brought a
[50:37] remission of the sins of yesterday as
[50:39] well where we can live good up in the
[50:41] morning and know what we used to do but
[50:44] it's separated from me I don't believe
[50:46] that condemnation has to plague a young
[50:49] young young person or a marriage or a
[50:51] mama or a daddy it don't matter what you
[50:53] used to do there's a remission of the
[50:56] very sins that you used to commit and
[50:59] brother Brandon will tell us consider
[51:01] this since it is the blood of God it is
[51:03] the perfect blood and if the perfect
[51:05] blood is loosening us or bringing a
[51:08] remission from the power and bondage and
[51:10] defilement of sin then the loosening is
[51:13] perfect and complete there was now no
[51:16] more condemnation he would say there it
[51:19] is he gave his day G he gave us the
[51:21] blood and the blood has loosed us there
[51:24] was now no condemnation how can there be
[51:27] there was nothing to be condemned for
[51:29] because the blood has loosed us we are
[51:32] free Guiltless don't listen to the man
[51:35] listen to the word you are loosed by the
[51:38] blood I like how he puts it don't listen
[51:40] to the man listen to the word and I say
[51:43] don't listen to condemnation listen to
[51:46] the word you are loosed by the blood if
[51:49] it's a perfect blood that means it's a
[51:51] perfect loosening that means it's
[51:53] completely separated where God don't
[51:55] even say it anymore you remember the
[51:57] story brother Brandon would tell of the
[51:59] young lady that was a young girl that
[52:01] was having a tea party and she had a
[52:03] daddy that was religious y'all remember
[52:04] the story and brother Brandon would tell
[52:06] us that when she would get her friends
[52:08] to come over he would she would get her
[52:10] daddy and would say go up in the attic
[52:12] take his Bible away and give him a book
[52:14] of geography you remember that says stay
[52:17] up here Daddy don't embarrass me don't
[52:19] go and Shout him don't go and rejoicing
[52:21] I'm going to come down and have this
[52:22] party and brother Brandon would tell us
[52:24] as she was having that tea party he says
[52:26] all of a sudden the chandelier would
[52:28] begin to bounce he would start to
[52:30] Rejoice up there and the girl would run
[52:32] upstairs and would say daddy why why are
[52:35] you so excited I took your Bible away
[52:38] and he would say well I'm looking in
[52:39] this in this book that you given me and
[52:42] it tells me that the deepest part of the
[52:45] ocean the the humans has never found it
[52:47] yet and I thought if they can't find the
[52:50] deepest part of the ocean what about God
[52:52] see a forgetfulness if they can't find
[52:55] the bottom of it I can never find the
[52:57] bottom of God's forgetfulness and I say
[53:00] that's where we stand today not just
[53:02] forgiven but a separation but a
[53:05] remission where when God looks at you he
[53:07] does not see it oh you never committed a
[53:10] sin in the first place not just forgiven
[53:13] but Justified Sanctified filled with the
[53:16] life of the blood where the very
[53:18] conscience of sin has been taken away
[53:21] Hallelujah and I believe tonight if
[53:23] there's a young person an adult that are
[53:26] strugling with the life of sin there's a
[53:28] remission that the life of the blood can
[53:31] bring you this evening where you can
[53:33] leave this place a different a different
[53:35] human being the very conscience of the
[53:38] sin can be dealt with oh hallelujah it's
[53:41] a perfect blood bringing a perfect
[53:44] loosening so that's why we're no longer
[53:46] known by our own nature we're not the
[53:48] man or the woman we used to be but
[53:51] there's a separation oh Hallelujah and
[53:54] so brother the Brandon would tell us
[53:56] that God would show his longsuffering
[53:59] and his kindness to pharaoh and the
[54:01] people of Egypt there in the token
[54:02] messages he preaches while five or six
[54:05] token messages and he would tell us that
[54:07] the God was showing his kindness and
[54:09] longsuffering to Pharaoh but they would
[54:11] not heed to the message and it's so
[54:14] incredible how brother Brandon put it he
[54:16] says he sent them a prophet he sent them
[54:18] signs he sent them the pillar of fire
[54:21] and behind all of these signs was a
[54:23] message and the message was let my
[54:26] people people go and I like how brother
[54:28] Brandon would put it he says they would
[54:30] not repent and they ignored all of his
[54:32] signs his Prophet his message and now
[54:35] God is making a separation he says he
[54:38] got fed up with him and what was the
[54:40] separation it was the token and so the
[54:43] token was to separate them from the
[54:45] Judgment that was coming upon the city
[54:48] cuz we would see that there would there
[54:50] would be the the the death angel would
[54:52] be coming through the land right and
[54:54] would be striking homes going inside of
[54:55] this home take him this firstborn going
[54:58] into that home take him that firstborn
[55:00] but mommy and daddy under the blood
[55:02] could have an assurance that there was a
[55:05] separation from the from the Judgment
[55:08] that was coming upon the city and I
[55:10] don't believe that the plagues that were
[55:12] in Egypt was for the Israelites it was
[55:15] for the Egyptians oh come on now neither
[55:18] is the Judgment that is upon the Earth
[55:21] today for your minds for your body for
[55:24] your marriages for your for for your
[55:26] conscience condemnation is a judgment
[55:29] upon the Earth but it's not for you oh
[55:32] you may say I'm fighting in my mind yes
[55:34] you're inlay judgments are upon the
[55:37] Earth today but there is a separation
[55:40] under a token that can that can take you
[55:42] out of the the complexes that can take
[55:45] you out of the the the divorc spirit
[55:48] that tries to come against the home
[55:50] there's a there's a token that can
[55:52] separate you from the judgments that are
[55:55] upon the Earth today oh you see that the
[55:58] the Judgment was not for the for the
[56:01] Israelites it was for the Egyptians and
[56:03] the Bible would tell us that we're
[56:05] living in a day where there's
[56:07] 200,000,000 demons that has been
[56:09] released you
[56:11] know that there's spear that there's
[56:13] fear that is gripping the world today
[56:15] you know while we're living in a peace
[56:17] there's fear that is walking out on the
[56:20] streets today you see they're a part of
[56:22] the Judgment but you have been separated
[56:25] from it but you know the Brandon would
[56:27] tell us that they were to apply the
[56:29] blood and they were in Egypt would apply
[56:30] the blood with hisp right and he would
[56:33] say they would that hisp wasn't
[56:34] something special it was a common weed
[56:37] that was among all the Palestine and he
[56:40] would say that that HP is a type of your
[56:43] faith and could you imagine being
[56:44] Pharaoh there in his home realizing that
[56:48] there's prophecy being fulfilled the
[56:50] judgment is going through the homes
[56:52] going through the streets he heard this
[56:54] one maybe heard a cry of this one over
[56:57] here their daughter just died or their
[56:59] son just died he knew that judgment was
[57:02] coming to his home and could you imagine
[57:04] just thinking as a father what can I do
[57:07] to stop this judgment maybe I can do
[57:09] this maybe I can do that but he did not
[57:11] know that right among him was a common
[57:14] weed and a blood that can separate him
[57:18] from the Judgment every living in a day
[57:21] where they think a new president is
[57:22] going to help maybe PR some more money
[57:24] will help maybe some more politicians
[57:27] will help here but they fa to realize
[57:29] that right among them now is a common
[57:32] faith that has been restored that we can
[57:35] apply the token and it separates us from
[57:38] the Judgment the anxieties the fears the
[57:41] complexes oh Hallelujah divorcement that

[57:56] separating us from the from the Judgment
[57:59] that is upon the Earth today oh
[58:02] Hallelujah while the world is looking
[58:04] for something big to bring a certainty
[58:07] there's something right Among Us that is
[58:09] that that that faith has been restored
[58:12] and it's bringing a separation oh my but
[58:15] you see brother Brandon would preach the
[58:16] token and would tell us that the token
[58:19] is the is the evidence that the price
[58:21] has been paid right he would talk about
[58:24] a train car or if you're going to get on
[58:26] on a bus or get on a get on an airplane
[58:28] you don't bring your money to the to
[58:30] your Gates but you got to have a ticket
[58:32] right and he would say the ticket is the
[58:35] token whenever you go when you fly I I
[58:37] just went to Czech Republic here about a
[58:39] month and a half ago or so and whenever
[58:42] I got to the airport I didn't bring my
[58:44] my my cash and would say hey I W to go
[58:46] to I need to get to Amsterdam and from
[58:49] Amsterdam I need to get over there to to
[58:51] Prague Czech Republic I couldn't give
[58:53] him my money the money purchased what
[58:56] months ago but now I am identifying
[58:59] myself with what my money had already
[59:01] purchased my money did no good at that
[59:04] point but that money had purchased me
[59:06] something oh you can be saying we got
[59:08] the blood we got the blood we got the
[59:10] blood but the blood has done something
[59:12] for you come on now the blood has
[59:14] purchased something that has brought a
[59:17] separation I could not come to the to
[59:19] the ticket counter and say here here's
[59:22] my $1,200 I need to get the truck
[59:24] Republic they wouldn't accept it no I
[59:26] got to be identified I got to be
[59:29] identified with what the purchase had
[59:31] bought for me that that day and you
[59:33] would see that when I get there I I
[59:35] would not go to security IID didn't
[59:37] check in my bags but first I had to be
[59:40] identified first then once I got
[59:42] identified got the ticket got the token
[59:45] now I am eligible to check in my bag I'm
[59:48] eligible to go through security I'm
[59:50] eligible to go through the Customs it
[59:53] don't matter the complications that are
[59:55] ahead of me I'm eligible to go through
[59:58] them because of the token and you're not
[1:00:01] eligible to see the supernatural until
[1:00:03] you get the token but once you get the
[1:00:06] token the all of Heaven has been opened
[1:00:08] up to you where it don't matter if it's
[1:00:10] a rebellious teenager you're the
[1:00:12] supernatural has been given to you and
[1:00:15] you're eligible for it oh
[1:00:18] hallelujah we're eligible for it you see
[1:00:21] whenever you get the token it's God
[1:00:23] saying here's the scepter you've got
[1:00:26] whatever you have need of you speak the
[1:00:28] word not me speaking the word you're
[1:00:30] speaking the word and I will honor that
[1:00:33] word oh Hallelujah but but you know that
[1:00:36] I I got a complex of flying that I
[1:00:40] always get nervous at security and I
[1:00:42] feel like the security guys just hate me
[1:00:45] you'll ever feel that way I just I get
[1:00:47] to security and I think my goodness quit
[1:00:49] laughing I know what you're thinking you
[1:00:51] know you get to you get there and you
[1:00:53] think my goodness they're going to turn
[1:00:55] me around but there's nothing they can
[1:00:57] do to turn me around but there are some
[1:00:59] things they can do you I've lost my
[1:01:01] luggage too many times and so I like to
[1:01:03] take a carryon back right you can take
[1:01:06] it with you on into the plane you can
[1:01:07] put it under your seat or put it up on
[1:01:09] the on on the top of the thing you know
[1:01:11] and you see but but but in that carry-on
[1:01:13] back there were some items that can't go
[1:01:16] through security right sometimes I
[1:01:18] forget about my big shampoo or my body
[1:01:21] washer or maybe a razor or something and
[1:01:23] and it's always depressing whenever you
[1:01:25] make it through security you're standing
[1:01:28] there you're waiting on your bag and
[1:01:29] I've even got that pre-check thing I
[1:01:31] don't got to take my shoes off I I don't
[1:01:33] got to take my belt off I don't got to
[1:01:35] take my computer out of my back all I
[1:01:37] got to do is walk through but it's
[1:01:39] always depressing standing there you see
[1:01:41] your bag come through the scanner it
[1:01:43] stops and it slides over and you're like
[1:01:46] oh man but you see they can't turn me
[1:01:49] around but they can do something they
[1:01:51] can take some items out of my bag that
[1:01:54] cannot go onto the flight yeah oh
[1:01:57] Hallelujah and you know what they say
[1:01:58] who has this bag here it's mine okay is
[1:02:01] okay if I open it yeah you can open okay
[1:02:04] why do we got oh this here this can't
[1:02:06] get on board what do you want me to do
[1:02:08] with it you want to take it back to your
[1:02:10] car or do you want me to throw it away I
[1:02:13] said Lord no I ain't going back I've
[1:02:15] come too far throw it away and so God
[1:02:18] has given the devil permission he can't
[1:02:21] take you away he can't turn you around
[1:02:24] but there are some things that the devil
[1:02:26] is allowed to knock off of you maybe
[1:02:28] that bitterness it can't make a Rapture
[1:02:31] maybe that gossip can't make a Rapture
[1:02:33] the devil can't turn you around but he
[1:02:36] can knock some things off of you and you
[1:02:38] know what I say we've come too far to be
[1:02:40] turned around because of little sins
[1:02:43] we've come too far to be turned around
[1:02:45] because of bitterness we've come too far
[1:02:48] to be turned around we've gotten
[1:02:50] something in this generation that has
[1:02:52] given us a ticket for blast off oh
[1:02:56] hallelujah we're in the countdown not at
[1:02:58] the beginning not in the middle we're at
[1:03:01] the end time we're it's blast off it's
[1:03:03] time to step into our body change this
[1:03:06] ain't time to turn around and give up
[1:03:09] and lay down and embrace things of the
[1:03:12] world it's time to throw them away and
[1:03:15] say let me get on the
[1:03:16] plane let me get in this Rapture I ain't
[1:03:20] turning around throw it
[1:03:22] out how don't want that shampoo throw it
[1:03:25] out throw it away throw that razor I
[1:03:28] know it cost me something but throw it
[1:03:30] out you know bitterness cost you more to
[1:03:33] keep than throw it away oh I'm preaching
[1:03:35] now it cost you more it eats you up it
[1:03:38] eats you up I say let's throw it
[1:03:42] out oh it ain't time to go back where we
[1:03:44] started throw it out oh Hallelujah you
[1:03:49] see it's the token that identifies you
[1:03:51] but the brand say there you are the
[1:03:53] blood the blood he says the token not
[1:03:56] the blood chemistry but the token the
[1:03:58] Holy Ghost the life of the blood that
[1:04:01] comes what does that life do it comes
[1:04:03] and confirms what the token has been
[1:04:06] purchased for the token confirms what
[1:04:09] the blood has bought for you the blood
[1:04:12] purchased for Redemption the token is
[1:04:15] the evidence of it the blood he was
[1:04:17] wounded for our transgressions he was
[1:04:19] bruised for our iniquities the
[1:04:21] chastisement of our peace was upon him
[1:04:24] with the stripes we were healed see all
[1:04:27] blood blood blood then when the token
[1:04:29] comes it shows what you've been
[1:04:31] identified with that's
[1:04:33] sacrifice amen the devil can't keep you
[1:04:37] from it he says the blood purchased it
[1:04:39] but the Holy Ghost the token is the
[1:04:42] evidence of it and he says then once
[1:04:44] you're identified with it the devil
[1:04:46] can't keep you from it oh what a
[1:04:48] revelation the devil can't keep you from
[1:04:50] it he may trying to scare you you know
[1:04:52] like security they all look tough they
[1:04:54] all look mean they all look they're
[1:04:56] they're ready to to send you back but if
[1:04:57] you've got the token they can look mean
[1:05:00] they can intimidate they can pressure
[1:05:02] they can influence but they can't take
[1:05:04] you back and the devil can intimidate
[1:05:06] you he can pressure you he can influence
[1:05:09] you but with the token with the Holy
[1:05:12] Ghost he can't turn you
[1:05:14] around Hallelujah the devil cannot keep
[1:05:17] you from it and so but the brand tell us
[1:05:20] that there's a difference from the
[1:05:21] chemical the blood and the life he says
[1:05:24] under this glor place under this
[1:05:26] Covenant there's a difference between
[1:05:28] the blood and the life the token for the
[1:05:30] believer today is the Holy Ghost and so
[1:05:33] but the Brandon would tell us that
[1:05:35] whenever the the Holy Ghost would
[1:05:37] overshadow Mary he says the life would
[1:05:39] come inside and would create a blood
[1:05:41] shell right and he says that blood shell
[1:05:44] would create another cell it would
[1:05:46] create another cell it would create
[1:05:48] cells until Jesus would be birthed upon
[1:05:51] the Earth but he says whenever Christ
[1:05:53] was upon the cross and he was being
[1:05:56] crucified he says the blood chemistry
[1:05:59] would go back to the elements where it
[1:06:01] came from but the life would come back
[1:06:04] to the believer oh Hallelujah we may not
[1:06:07] got the literal blood but we've got the
[1:06:09] literal life and then brother br going
[1:06:11] say every believer can be wrapped in the
[1:06:15] life of that blood shell can be wrapped
[1:06:18] in other words whenever you're WRA in
[1:06:20] this life before the devil can get to
[1:06:23] you he's got to go through the blood and
[1:06:25] he can't get through the blood you
[1:06:27] remember brother brand was say many
[1:06:29] people say the devil made me do it and
[1:06:31] he says no he says you just wasn't born
[1:06:34] again he says once you're born again the
[1:06:37] only way the devil can get to you is to
[1:06:39] repent be baptized and be filled with
[1:06:41] the Holy Ghost then he's your brother
[1:06:44] you see before he can get through the
[1:06:46] blood he's got to become one of you and
[1:06:49] there's no way let me say this there's
[1:06:52] no way for the devil to become bride and
[1:06:55] there's no way for the bride to become
[1:06:57] serpent seed the devil likes to come and
[1:06:59] say you're serpent seed you've send your
[1:07:01] day of Grace away you're just you're
[1:07:04] part of the tribulation Saint if you're
[1:07:06] the bride of Christ you were born the
[1:07:08] bride of Christ this message didn't make
[1:07:11] you a bride it called you out to place
[1:07:13] you as the bride but you was born with
[1:07:16] the predestinated seed and there's
[1:07:19] nothing the devil can do to take that
[1:07:21] away from
[1:07:23] you Hallelujah
[1:07:26] once we're wrapped in the blood cell of
[1:07:28] the life that means you're secure
[1:07:30] brother Brandon going say another thing
[1:07:32] is a seal is security seal means you are
[1:07:36] secured you see not that and now you
[1:07:38] that don't believe in eternal security I
[1:07:40] don't know but now a seal signifies
[1:07:44] security to its destination woe unto the
[1:07:47] guy that would try to break that seal
[1:07:50] and the Holy Spirit cannot be broken you
[1:07:52] heard me say that the people said that
[1:07:55] devil made me do this no no no the devil
[1:07:57] didn't do it you just wasn't sealed in
[1:08:00] you see cuz when you're sealed in he
[1:08:02] sealed out now you went out to him he
[1:08:05] couldn't get to you because the only way
[1:08:08] he could come in through the same
[1:08:09] process that you have to come he'd have
[1:08:12] to be saved Sanctified filled with the
[1:08:15] Holy Ghost then he is your brethren but
[1:08:18] once you are wrapped in this life he
[1:08:20] says the God God is sealed in and the
[1:08:22] devil is sealed out and it's sealed to
[1:08:25] the the day of your Redemption it ain't
[1:08:27] sealed till tomorrow it ain't sealed to
[1:08:30] the next youth meeting you ain't sealed
[1:08:32] just to the next Convention of the next
[1:08:34] T meeting but you are sealed all the way
[1:08:37] to your
[1:08:39] destination you see my destination ain't
[1:08:41] to just the camp meeting next month that
[1:08:44] ain't my destination that's helping me
[1:08:46] get to my destination my destination
[1:08:48] ain't to just when I get graduated or if
[1:08:51] when I get married or when I become a
[1:08:53] father that ain't my destination my
[1:08:55] destination is when I Lay My Sword down
[1:08:59] for the last time and I fight the last
[1:09:01] mind battle and I step out of out of
[1:09:04] mortality into immortality that is my
[1:09:07] destination and so once you are sealed
[1:09:10] there's nothing that can unseal you you
[1:09:12] are secured and I believe that's where
[1:09:15] we are standing today not just partially
[1:09:17] sealed or partially separated but it's a
[1:09:20] perfect separation and you are perfectly
[1:09:23] secure to the day of your Redemption
[1:09:26] brother Brandon would say listen close
[1:09:28] while I make these closing remarks if
[1:09:30] Satan tries to hand you some of this
[1:09:32] stuff like sickness you know what to do
[1:09:35] to show him the token I'm a purchased
[1:09:38] product my healing has been paid for I'm
[1:09:40] a product of God you cannot keep me uh
[1:09:44] you cannot keep me off of this highway
[1:09:46] you cannot keep me from my health I
[1:09:48] present the token and show you by your
[1:09:51] stripes I was healed he is the
[1:09:54] resurrection
[1:09:55] here is the resurrection of Jesus Christ
[1:09:58] right in me now to prove to you oh there
[1:10:01] is a real thing there is a token and I
[1:10:05] like how he's putting it there's proof
[1:10:06] of the Resurrection in me now there is a
[1:10:10] real thing there is a token you see the
[1:10:13] devil can argue and say well the Holy
[1:10:15] Ghost is just emotion the Holy Ghost is
[1:10:18] just a sensation but there's evidence
[1:10:20] inside of you that's brought forth a
[1:10:23] separation that the devil can argue
[1:10:25] quotes he can argue scriptures but he
[1:10:28] cannot argue the life that has brought
[1:10:31] us
[1:10:32] separation oh Hallelujah right in me now
[1:10:36] is the resurrection of Jesus Christ
[1:10:39] Resurrection lives in me now
[1:10:40] Resurrection ain't coming it's in you
[1:10:43] now it's in you now it's quick in your
[1:10:45] mortal body you remember brother Brown
[1:10:48] matela would talk about Elisha that
[1:10:50] whenever he was dead would be in the
[1:10:52] would be in that cave he his bones were
[1:10:54] in the cave but the Brandon would tell
[1:10:56] us that there that there was a battle
[1:10:58] that was taking place and there was a
[1:10:59] man that had died and there was some
[1:11:01] friends that had picked up the man and
[1:11:03] would throw him in that cave but as soon
[1:11:06] as that dead body hit the bones of elasa
[1:11:09] but the brandom says quickening power
[1:11:11] were still on those bones and he says
[1:11:13] that dead body would come back to life
[1:11:16] and would run out of that Tob or run out
[1:11:18] of that cave could you imagine being
[1:11:20] those friends that would pick up your
[1:11:22] dead comrade and would throw him inside
[1:11:24] of that cave and he would come running
[1:11:26] back out you that's the way it's going
[1:11:28] to be one day you may be dead in the
[1:11:30] grave you may have your skin worms that
[1:11:33] is decay in your body but quickening
[1:11:35] power is still in that is still in those
[1:11:38] bones and there's nothing the devil can
[1:11:40] do to keep your body inside of the grave
[1:11:44] and I say there's nothing the devil can
[1:11:46] do to keep me out of a Rapture hey I may
[1:11:49] go the way of the grave but if I'm
[1:11:51] predestinated to go by the way of the
[1:11:53] Rapture there's nothing that the devil
[1:11:55] can do I've got quickening power on the
[1:11:58] ins shred of this
[1:12:00] body Hallelujah but you see how come
[1:12:03] it's the evening time that the devil's
[1:12:05] fighting so hard against the Holy Ghost
[1:12:08] have you ever thought about that how
[1:12:09] come it's the evening time cuz brother
[1:12:11] Brown I'm going tell us the lamb was
[1:12:13] killed in the evening time after being
[1:12:15] kept up for 14 days he says then the
[1:12:18] lamb was killed and the blood was
[1:12:20] applied in the evening time and so how
[1:12:23] come it's the evening time that the Holy
[1:12:25] Ghost is being being fought so hard
[1:12:27] against because the Bible would tell us
[1:12:30] that the blood of Jesus would speak
[1:12:31] better things than that of Abel you
[1:12:34] remember the story of there there in
[1:12:36] Genesis that God would come to come to
[1:12:38] Cain and would say where is your breth
[1:12:41] and Cain would say am I My Brother's
[1:12:42] Keeper you know and God would speak to
[1:12:45] him and would say your the blood of Abel
[1:12:48] speaks out against you and you and
[1:12:50] brother Bron the Bible would tell us the
[1:12:52] Apostle Paul would say the blood of
[1:12:54] Jesus speaks better things than that of
[1:12:57] Abel and so the blood of Abel would
[1:12:59] speak out against him but the blood of
[1:13:02] Jesus speaks out for you and so in other
[1:13:05] words under the Old Testament was
[1:13:07] condemnation but under the the New
[1:13:09] Testament the blood of Jesus ain't
[1:13:11] condemnation it's liberty and the and
[1:13:14] the Bible would tell us that the blood
[1:13:16] has a voice it speaks better things and
[1:13:19] brother Brandon would say now we also
[1:13:21] find in Hebrews the 12th chapter and the
[1:13:24] 24th verse first the New Testament the
[1:13:26] blood speaks better things the blood is
[1:13:28] speaking then the blood has got a voice
[1:13:31] and the voice of the blood is the word
[1:13:34] and so what we got in this generation is
[1:13:37] the loosening of the seals and what that
[1:13:39] is speaking is the voice of the blood
[1:13:42] and the Holy Ghost identifies you with
[1:13:45] what the voice of the blood speaks
[1:13:48] that's why the devil fights so hard
[1:13:50] against the Holy Ghost because the
[1:13:52] message has brought us our inheritance
[1:13:55] and says here's your body change here's
[1:13:57] your rapture and the Holy Ghost says hey
[1:13:59] that's mine it ain't just my neighbors
[1:14:02] it ain't just the pastor but it's mine
[1:14:04] it identifies you with what the word has
[1:14:07] brought but we're living in a day we're
[1:14:09] trying to cancel the Holy Ghost you know
[1:14:11] me and brother Andrew Glover had went to
[1:14:13] England uh I would say three years ago I
[1:14:16] think it was and and we had our tickets
[1:14:18] we had our token we got to our lay over
[1:14:21] there in Paris and and and that ticket
[1:14:23] got us through customs it got us through
[1:14:25] security and we find our gate and we
[1:14:28] wait there for about 3 hours you know
[1:14:30] and they start the boarding process and
[1:14:32] we get to the gate we get to the counter
[1:14:34] and we give them a ticket and they say
[1:14:36] and the lady says no you don't got a
[1:14:37] ticket and we say man we got a ticket no
[1:14:40] you don't got a ticket we said we got a
[1:14:42] ticket right here it's brought us this
[1:14:44] far and they says no you don't got a
[1:14:46] ticket go talk to go to the information
[1:14:48] desk and talk to them and here while we
[1:14:51] was waiting in line to see the
[1:14:53] information desk or our light left
[1:14:55] without us could you imagine that a
[1:14:58] ticket brought us that far but as soon
[1:15:00] as we got to the brink of our
[1:15:02] inheritance to the brink of the body
[1:15:04] change to the to the threshold of the
[1:15:07] Rapture they tried canceling our ticket
[1:15:10] and that's what the devil has done today
[1:15:12] you see they tried they canceled our
[1:15:14] ticket and expected us to get to our
[1:15:17] destination and the many times I hope
[1:15:19] this is okay people inside of a church
[1:15:22] tries quenching up the Holy Ghost and
[1:15:24] expect your young people to see a
[1:15:26] Rapture you your young people cannot see
[1:15:29] a Rapture without a move of God come on
[1:15:33] now they can't see Liberty without the
[1:15:35] move of God and we try to cancel the
[1:15:38] Holy Ghost it's the devil coming and
[1:15:40] trying to cancel the
[1:15:42] identification of what this message has
[1:15:45] brought us hey the Holy Ghost a't no
[1:15:48] sensation but we need the Holy Ghost to
[1:15:51] identify us with the word that has been
[1:15:53] brought in this
[1:15:56] generation oh Hallelujah we need the
[1:15:59] Holy
[1:16:00] Ghost brother Brandon must say the that
[1:16:03] the the life that is in you speaks from
[1:16:05] the shed blood amen hey old brother I
[1:16:08] wish everybody could see that see if you
[1:16:10] can see what it is it's the life that is
[1:16:13] in you see the blood is identifying you
[1:16:16] with it the blood is identifying you
[1:16:19] with it and so whatever the blood speaks
[1:16:22] then the Holy Ghost identifies you with
[1:16:24] it you know brother Brandon would say in
[1:16:26] a court he says when a court writes out
[1:16:28] a word he says the penalty is such and
[1:16:31] such he says the law of the Court
[1:16:33] enforces the word of the court and then
[1:16:36] he would say when God speaks anything
[1:16:38] that is Law and the Holy Ghost is here
[1:16:41] to enforce the law regardless of the
[1:16:44] conditions oh so just like the court
[1:16:46] whenever the judge gives a sentence the
[1:16:48] law enforces it that's the way it is
[1:16:51] with the word and the Holy Ghost
[1:16:52] whenever the word is brought to a
[1:16:54] generation ation then the Holy Ghost
[1:16:56] enforces that word and I believe that
[1:16:59] we're leaving in that time right now
[1:17:01] where the open book has been given to a
[1:17:04] generation that we know the thoughts of
[1:17:06] God we know what God has for this
[1:17:08] generation but we've got the token to
[1:17:11] enforce what the what the word has
[1:17:13] brought to us and so we've got a claim
[1:17:16] in this generation that has broken off
[1:17:18] every claim that the devil had a claim
[1:17:21] on us you know brother Brandon going
[1:17:22] talk about he says the title deed and
[1:17:24] there's the difference between the title
[1:17:26] deed and the abstract he says you can
[1:17:28] have the title deed but if there's
[1:17:30] claims against it all of that don't
[1:17:33] belong to you but he says if there's an
[1:17:35] abstract that knocks off every claim
[1:17:38] that the devil would have upon the title
[1:17:40] deed and he says you can have the word
[1:17:43] but there can be claims against you but
[1:17:45] with the abstract the Holy Ghost it
[1:17:48] knocks off every claim that is against
[1:17:51] you and brother Brandon would say this
[1:17:53] who are your sickness who do you think
[1:17:55] you are Satan who do you claim to be
[1:17:58] every claim that you had was cancelled
[1:18:01] at Calvary you're a bluff you have no
[1:18:04] rights we defy you in the name of Jesus
[1:18:07] Christ as a holy ghost filled of body
[1:18:10] who are you sickness who do you claim to
[1:18:12] be he says every claim was cancelled you
[1:18:15] know what that means whenever whenever
[1:18:17] the blood shell was released at Calvary
[1:18:20] that broke every claim you know
[1:18:22] generational curses or claims all right
[1:18:25] come on now generational curses can go
[1:18:27] from Marriage to marriage to marriage or
[1:18:29] go from from child to child to child
[1:18:32] where you're you're maybe your
[1:18:33] grandfather struggled with adultery then
[1:18:35] your daddy struggled with adultery now
[1:18:37] you're struggling with adultery it's a
[1:18:39] generational curse it's a claim that had
[1:18:42] that that is upon your life maybe a
[1:18:44] divorcement that was your grandparents
[1:18:47] was divorced your parents were divorced
[1:18:49] now the devil's coming and saying well
[1:18:50] you're just a another statistic you're
[1:18:53] going to be divorced just like them it's
[1:18:54] a claim that the devil thinks he has
[1:18:57] upon you but let me tell you a secret
[1:18:59] every claim has been broke there's an
[1:19:02] abstract in this generation that we've
[1:19:04] got the word yes but there was claims
[1:19:07] against him but we've got the holy ghost
[1:19:10] that has broke off every claim you know
[1:19:12] brother Brandon would talk about the the
[1:19:14] little girl with leukemia I think I
[1:19:16] believe it was he would say that
[1:19:18] sickness would go from grandparents to
[1:19:20] her parents to her and he says but once
[1:19:23] the abstract comes he says that broke
[1:19:26] that off and I believe that same Holy
[1:19:28] Ghost is here that was a natural
[1:19:30] sickness but maybe it's a spiritual
[1:19:32] sickness maybe pornography it's gone
[1:19:35] from generation to generation but that
[1:19:37] has been broke off you know brother
[1:19:38] Brandon would say this here uh just like
[1:19:41] sickness enter the body or or sin or
[1:19:44] whatever it is say will the other ones
[1:19:45] drink the others do this or the others
[1:19:47] be this way but he has no legal rights
[1:19:51] and I could take my abstract deed and go
[1:19:53] down to the court and say look at here
[1:19:55] someone here has moved in to my house
[1:19:58] that doesn't belong there that this is
[1:20:00] mine it belongs to me and the law would
[1:20:02] come up and put them out because I have
[1:20:05] an abstract written deed to the property
[1:20:08] and brother sister we have an abstracts
[1:20:10] written deed tonight to Salvation Divine
[1:20:13] Healing the devil has no rights trust
[1:20:17] God and the Holy Ghost to put him out
[1:20:19] amen I feel religious right now somehow
[1:20:22] I really do all right he said says if
[1:20:25] you've got the abstract title deed then
[1:20:27] that puts out the every every claim the
[1:20:29] devil would have upon you that's where
[1:20:32] we're living today but the brand said in
[1:20:34] another place and put it on the book of
[1:20:36] life but was born through a man and
[1:20:38] woman subject to sin and guilty of sin
[1:20:41] but when I believed on it I received the
[1:20:44] deed but when the Holy Ghost come it was
[1:20:47] the abstract that everything against me
[1:20:50] whether my mother done it my father done
[1:20:52] it my grandmother done it like the
[1:20:54] little epileptic child I prayed for a
[1:20:56] few minutes ago that come from the
[1:20:58] grandparents the epilepsy fell down upon
[1:21:01] that child but when the abstract come it
[1:21:04] struck it off it omitted everything and
[1:21:07] so the very sins that your mother would
[1:21:10] commit or your father would commit or
[1:21:12] your grandparents would commit when the
[1:21:14] abstract come it omitted
[1:21:16] it oh the devil has claims on us until
[1:21:20] the abstract comes oh Hallelujah you
[1:21:24] wonder how how boys are high passionate
[1:21:27] sometimes it's passed down or a gossip
[1:21:29] spirit it's passed down or or you know
[1:21:32] what I'm talking about you you can
[1:21:33] identify some things you know yeah this
[1:21:35] was passed down that was passed down but
[1:21:37] there's something here that has brought
[1:21:39] a separation where you don't got to be
[1:21:41] another statistic on how many's ever
[1:21:44] heard that voice before you're just
[1:21:45] another statistic well I'm a young boy
[1:21:47] so I got to look that pronography that's
[1:21:49] a lie that's a claim the devil thinks he
[1:21:51] has on you well I got to go out and
[1:21:54] smoke that's a you're going to be
[1:21:55] another statistic that's a claim the
[1:21:57] devil thinks he has or I got to look I
[1:22:00] got to fit in with the rest of the girls
[1:22:02] so I got to get my my maybe get some
[1:22:04] tighter skirts on some some skirts that
[1:22:06] come up a little higher that's the claim
[1:22:08] the devil thinks he has upon you but
[1:22:11] every claim has been broke oh Hallelujah
[1:22:15] you're not another
[1:22:17] statistic come on young people you're
[1:22:19] not another statistic you're not another
[1:22:21] statistic you're the bride of Christ
[1:22:23] you're not another sta istic of the
[1:22:25] devil to ruin your life and put put
[1:22:28] condemnation on you and put pornography
[1:22:30] on you and smoking and Drugs That's not
[1:22:32] what God has for you we're not
[1:22:35] statistics we're the bride of Christ and
[1:22:37] you would see that you would look at
[1:22:39] Rahab Rahab should have been another
[1:22:41] statistic you know cuz the Bible would
[1:22:43] tell us that her house was upon the city
[1:22:46] walls and could you imagine being being
[1:22:48] Rahab you're sitting there inside of
[1:22:50] your home and you see you look out the
[1:22:52] window and you see them marching around
[1:22:54] the walls the first day all the way to
[1:22:56] the seventh day and all of a sudden you
[1:22:58] hear a shout the trumpets are starting
[1:23:00] to blare and you feel a shaken and you
[1:23:02] look out your window this part of the
[1:23:04] wall is fall falling that part of the
[1:23:05] wall is falling and you know man I'm
[1:23:07] next I'm miss another statistic of this
[1:23:10] the walls falling down but then she
[1:23:13] could look to a promise I've got a true
[1:23:16] token I've got a true token you know
[1:23:18] what the Bible would tell us in Joshua 2
[1:23:20] and12 now therefore I pray you swear
[1:23:22] unto me by the Lord since I have showed
[1:23:25] you kindness that you will also show
[1:23:27] kindness unto my father's house and give
[1:23:30] me a true token and so reab was sitting
[1:23:33] there in a shaking time looking like she
[1:23:36] was going to be another statistic but
[1:23:38] she can look to a true
[1:23:40] token oh we've got something in this
[1:23:43] generation we've got something true not
[1:23:45] a false token not a make Bel token we've
[1:23:48] got a positive token that can bring you
[1:23:51] out of the statistics and put you on a
[1:23:53] Sol that ground and say yeah that one
[1:23:55] there may be falling that house is
[1:23:57] falling apart that marriage is falling
[1:23:59] apart that young person is bound by
[1:24:01] addictions that Young Person's Bound by
[1:24:03] this they're Bound by that but sure not
[1:24:05] a part of that there's a
[1:24:07] separation and you know why Rahab would
[1:24:10] ask for a true token you know the Bible
[1:24:12] would tell us a few verses before that
[1:24:14] she's speaking to the spies now would
[1:24:17] say we have heard how how what you done
[1:24:19] to the Egyptians how your God split the
[1:24:22] Red Sea y y'all yall remember that
[1:24:23] scripture
[1:24:24] and she would continue on we have heard
[1:24:26] how your God done this and how your God
[1:24:28] done that and she comes down a few to
[1:24:31] the next few verses and we said there in
[1:24:33] made no more courage in any of the men's
[1:24:36] Hearts because of you and then the very
[1:24:39] next verse she says give me a true token
[1:24:42] she recognized that there was something
[1:24:44] Supernatural that was taking place and
[1:24:47] in order for her to be identified with
[1:24:50] the supernatural she needed the true
[1:24:53] token oh Hallelujah the move is on for
[1:24:57] the bride and I know it give me
[1:24:59] something true I don't want just some
[1:25:01] sensation I don't want some theology
[1:25:04] give me a true token that will separate
[1:25:07] me I don't want to water down religion
[1:25:10] give me something true yes sir give me
[1:25:12] something true Hallelujah give me
[1:25:16] something true where where I can
[1:25:17] intercede for for my loved ones where I
[1:25:20] can intercede for for lost parents where
[1:25:22] I can intercede for a rebellious
[1:25:24] teenager you know brother Brandon would
[1:25:26] say hold the token before your prayers
[1:25:29] you know he would say that he says hold
[1:25:31] the token before your prayers and he
[1:25:33] would say apply it to your family he
[1:25:35] says if you've got an unsaved child he
[1:25:38] says hold the token over them and say I
[1:25:40] claim them oh and that really spoke to
[1:25:43] me not God you claim them he says you
[1:25:46] claim them I claim them he says if you
[1:25:48] got an unsaved daughter say I claim them
[1:25:51] you see it's under a true token where
[1:25:53] we've been ident ified with the promises
[1:25:55] of
[1:25:56] God but random would say the true token
[1:25:59] of the blood speaking out speaks of a
[1:26:01] living resurrected presence of a living
[1:26:04] resurrected resurrected presence not a
[1:26:07] god of yesterday but a god of today and
[1:26:10] so it's something positive that has
[1:26:12] spoke for us because brother Brandon
[1:26:14] would tell us he would talk about Oswalt
[1:26:16] and you remember oswal brother Brandon
[1:26:18] would say could you imagine being him
[1:26:20] sitting in that prison cell knowing you
[1:26:22] just killed the president and says
[1:26:24] everybody the whole country is mad at
[1:26:27] you nobody's going going to want to
[1:26:28] speak for you could you imagine being in
[1:26:31] that condition knowing that if you're
[1:26:33] convicted for this you're going to be
[1:26:35] killed and no one's willing to speak for
[1:26:37] you then brother Brandon later on in
[1:26:39] that message he would put you in the
[1:26:41] prison cell and would say now you're in
[1:26:43] the prison cell you know you're guilty
[1:26:46] the judge knows you're guilty the jury
[1:26:48] knows you're guilty and he says but you
[1:26:50] need somebody to speak for you he says
[1:26:52] if you got somebody to speak speak for
[1:26:54] you he says then you can get a little
[1:26:56] more Assurance but you're not fully
[1:26:59] assured cuz you know they got to speak
[1:27:01] better things they with their shrewd
[1:27:04] speaking I love how he puts it he says
[1:27:05] if this attorney with the shrewd
[1:27:07] speaking and knowing of the laws could
[1:27:10] change that and complete your case and
[1:27:12] prove that you should live but yet in
[1:27:14] all of his great Authority and the great
[1:27:17] speech that he can make him the
[1:27:19] impression that he could put upon the
[1:27:21] jury or upon the judge he says maybe you
[1:27:24] can be relaxed be relaxed for a few
[1:27:26] minutes and I like how he's putting it's
[1:27:28] all upon the speech if he can speak
[1:27:30] better things if it's with the Shu
[1:27:32] speaking in other words he's got to
[1:27:34] speak better things than the evidence
[1:27:37] that is against you then brother Brandon
[1:27:39] would say but your judge became your
[1:27:42] returning to the very one that could
[1:27:44] bring judgment brought a
[1:27:46] separation oh Hallelujah and so the
[1:27:49] Devil comes and says that generational
[1:27:51] curses God's going to God's cursed you
[1:27:53] God's done this he he's thrown this upon
[1:27:55] you but in reality he is standing up
[1:27:58] speaking for you saying no you don't got
[1:28:01] to go that way I speak better things
[1:28:04] than that of generational curses I speak
[1:28:07] better things than that of condemnation
[1:28:09] I speak better things I'm speaking for
[1:28:12] you that's what makes the difference is
[1:28:15] the presence of God coming in speaking
[1:28:17] for you speaking in your behalf you know
[1:28:19] brother Brandon would say there's no
[1:28:20] devil that can stand before it there's
[1:28:23] nothing that can stand before it because
[1:28:25] God has accepted and you're and the you
[1:28:27] hold the token in your hand the price is
[1:28:29] paid oh it's a positive token the word
[1:28:33] positive means fully assured independent
[1:28:36] of changing circumstances unconditional
[1:28:39] so if you've got a positive token that
[1:28:41] means it's fully assured of what it
[1:28:44] speaks so when the blood speaks
[1:28:46] something it's positive it's fully
[1:28:48] assured no matter the conditions the
[1:28:50] Bible would tell us we have a more sure
[1:28:52] word of Prophecy and I like how it's
[1:28:54] putting it a more sure word of Prophecy
[1:28:57] not just a sure word but it's more sure
[1:28:59] we letting you know it's something
[1:29:02] positive you know when brother brandom
[1:29:04] he would he would preach the rising of
[1:29:05] the Sun and I think it's so incredible
[1:29:07] he would tell us that whenever the sun
[1:29:09] whenever he said let there be light and
[1:29:11] the and the sun would become the would
[1:29:13] come upon the Earth he says the Earth
[1:29:15] was laying there in a dark dismal gloomy
[1:29:18] atmosphere and I like that word gloomy
[1:29:21] you know cuz that that describes the age
[1:29:22] we're living in living in a negative
[1:29:25] world you know how many's ever been
[1:29:27] walking down the road like today I went
[1:29:28] to the gas station I walked in how are
[1:29:30] you doing oh just surviving it's a
[1:29:32] negative world you know you go down the
[1:29:33] road how are you doing how's your day
[1:29:35] today well this went wrong that went
[1:29:37] wrong maybe the dog bit the bit the mail
[1:29:39] man my car went and start and you hear
[1:29:41] the life story now you're you're wishing
[1:29:43] you didn't even ask right how many's
[1:29:45] ever been there it's a negative world
[1:29:47] it's a gloomy atmosphere where you wake
[1:29:50] up in the morning and man you it's it's
[1:29:52] gloomy that comes over you it's blue
[1:29:54] loose oh man this went wrong yesterday
[1:29:56] it's an atmosphere that comes over you
[1:29:59] and brother Brandon we we continue on to
[1:30:00] say a dismal gloomy atmosphere and the
[1:30:03] spirit of God moved upon the water and
[1:30:06] said let there be light and God had a
[1:30:08] reason to do that for beneath that water
[1:30:11] there were seeds that he had planted and
[1:30:14] had to have sunlight to make it
[1:30:17] live the the sunlight didn't plant the
[1:30:20] seeds but the sunlight came because
[1:30:22] seeds were already there but before that
[1:30:25] seed could be brought to life the Gloom
[1:30:27] had to be brought away oh come on and
[1:30:31] the same thing today there seeds this
[1:30:33] message didn't put the seed there it
[1:30:35] came because there was the seed there
[1:30:37] but the gloominess that the devil throws
[1:30:39] upon you has to be taken away he
[1:30:42] continues on to say and that was the
[1:30:44] first light that was that was ever given
[1:30:46] was God spoken word and he was saying he
[1:30:48] said let there be light and there was
[1:30:50] light that turned Darkness into light in
[1:30:52] order to bring the creation of Joy so
[1:30:56] before there could be a creation of Joy
[1:30:59] he says the gloomy atmosphere had to be
[1:31:01] taken away that's the reason God has
[1:31:03] given us a message he didn't want you
[1:31:05] being in the glooms he didn't want you
[1:31:07] being depressed that's judgment upon the
[1:31:09] Earth complexes he didn't want complexes
[1:31:12] upon you anxiety upon you that was a
[1:31:15] gloomy atmosphere but when God said let
[1:31:17] there be light there was a rising of the
[1:31:19] sun brother Brandon would talk about how
[1:31:22] in the rising of the sun he would say
[1:31:24] when the natural Sun would begin to rise
[1:31:26] he says it was that time it was a dual
[1:31:28] Sunrise he says when the natural sun
[1:31:30] came up he said also the spiritual sun
[1:31:33] came up not just the Su in but the S so
[1:31:35] in and we're living in a time where the
[1:31:38] word has been restored and it's brought
[1:31:40] a creation of Joy it's brought us
[1:31:43] something positive in a negative World
[1:31:46] we've got something positive you see the
[1:31:49] seeds were there but it was just covered
[1:31:51] over with gloom and your peace is still
[1:31:53] there maybe it's just covered up with
[1:31:55] Gloom maybe it's just covered up with
[1:31:56] depression your happiness is there maybe
[1:31:59] it's just covered up but we've had a
[1:32:01] positive word that is speaking better
[1:32:04] things you know it's troubless it's
[1:32:06] troubles in life that can bring us down
[1:32:08] into this atmosphere you remember there
[1:32:11] in Luke the Bible would tell us that
[1:32:13] Martha would would come up to Jesus and
[1:32:14] would start speak point out Mary she's
[1:32:17] doing this doing that doing this and
[1:32:19] Jesus would stop and look at her and
[1:32:21] would say Martha you were troubled about
[1:32:24] many things your TR it was the Troubles
[1:32:26] of life and and this really spoke to my
[1:32:28] heart the many times we can do this as
[1:32:31] Christians here stood Martha in the
[1:32:33] presence of Jesus you know if she had
[1:32:35] she needed healing in her body this was
[1:32:37] deity that could give it to her if she
[1:32:40] needed freedom from from troubless here
[1:32:42] was deity that could give it to her but
[1:32:45] in the Pres here here here she stood in
[1:32:48] the midst of Jesus Christ the god the
[1:32:50] maker of heavens and earth and the only
[1:32:52] thing she could point out was was the
[1:32:54] flaws of others yes sir come on now many
[1:32:57] times we get in troubl this this here
[1:33:00] happened that happened this happened and
[1:33:01] we come to church and God is speaking
[1:33:04] speaking to your needs speaking to my
[1:33:05] needs and we sit there saying oh yeah
[1:33:07] that person needs you oh hope so and so
[1:33:09] is listening I hope that one's oh man oh
[1:33:12] that one needs it you're troubled about
[1:33:14] many things and you're missing your
[1:33:16] visitation oh but the visitation is
[1:33:19] happening now it don't matter the
[1:33:21] troubles it don't matter the the gloomy
[1:33:23] ATM pheres it don't matter the
[1:33:25] negativity God deity is walking the AIS
[1:33:29] saying I've got a creation of Joy I know
[1:33:32] you might be in a creation or an
[1:33:34] atmosphere of Gloom but here's a
[1:33:35] creation the Bible would tell us that
[1:33:38] King Bazar was troubled and the and the
[1:33:40] countenance and his countenance changed
[1:33:42] and that's incredible it was because he
[1:33:44] was troubled it began to change who he
[1:33:47] was and that's what happens when we're
[1:33:49] troubled and we start to look at things
[1:33:51] in a different way you remember the
[1:33:52] disciples were upon the the boat and
[1:33:54] brother Brandon would tell us that they
[1:33:55] were they were telling testimonies of
[1:33:58] Jesus how he done this all all the
[1:34:00] Miracles and now here comes some
[1:34:02] troubles right here come some troubles
[1:34:04] it was the storm that would come against
[1:34:05] them the Bible would say in Luke 24:38
[1:34:08] and he said unto them why are you
[1:34:10] troubled and why do thoughts arise in
[1:34:13] your heart what were those thoughts
[1:34:15] negative thoughts because the Bible says
[1:34:17] they come to Jesus and would say do you
[1:34:19] care that we
[1:34:21] perish think about that now there were
[1:34:23] just telling testimonies of the goodness
[1:34:25] of God but now because of the troubles
[1:34:28] they think God is against them oh how
[1:34:31] many's ever been there God you've left
[1:34:32] me God you forsaken me why did you allow
[1:34:35] this why why did you permit this to
[1:34:36] happen and instead of looking at the
[1:34:39] positive that all things work together
[1:34:41] for the good of for the for the good of
[1:34:43] those who love God we look up a negative
[1:34:45] God you forsaken me but here stood Jesus
[1:34:48] stood up and would say peace be still he
[1:34:51] brought he brought a positive in the
[1:34:52] negative oh and he's here to bring a
[1:34:55] positive in the negative it don't matter
[1:34:57] what what the trials you're going
[1:34:59] through we've got a positive token you
[1:35:02] know negativity can bring you down many
[1:35:04] times you know brother Brandon I'm going
[1:35:05] say this here you're in a need of prayer
[1:35:07] too cuz you got a heavy heart but God
[1:35:10] knows the secret of the heart do you
[1:35:11] believe it he can tell me what your
[1:35:14] heaviness is about it's because you want
[1:35:16] a baby and I see two Dark Shadows and
[1:35:19] you've had two miscarriages in your time
[1:35:21] that is correct so what what brought
[1:35:24] this heaviness was scars what brought
[1:35:26] this heaviness was hurts man we're human
[1:35:29] beings man we get hurt we get scarred
[1:35:32] well this one talked about me we get
[1:35:34] hurt hey words have words have edges man
[1:35:36] words can hurt you maybe somebody talked
[1:35:38] against you and now there's a heaviness
[1:35:41] that comes over you and now that
[1:35:43] heaviness brought on Dark Shadows and
[1:35:45] brother Brandon would would tell us that
[1:35:47] these Shadows were devils it was a hurt
[1:35:50] it was a hurt that brought a I brought
[1:35:52] an atmosphere of Gloom but here stood a
[1:35:55] word that will look through that
[1:35:57] atmosphere and would see a creation of
[1:36:00] Joy Hallelujah he will look through
[1:36:02] those clouds brother Brandon would say

[1:36:09] Believer so here stands a Believer but
[1:36:11] he just has some he just has some

[1:39:51] Isaiah the spirit of the Lord is upon me
[1:39:53] you remember the scripture because the
[1:39:55] Lord has anointed me to preach Good
[1:39:57] Tidings unto the
[1:39:58] meek he has sent me to bind up the
[1:40:00] Brokenhearted and to proc Proclaim
[1:40:03] Liberty to the captives opening up the

[1:40:12] all that mourn to appoint unto them the
[1:40:15] mourn in Zion and to give unto them
[1:40:17] Beauty for Ashes the oil of joy for M
[1:40:20] mourning the Garment of Praise for the
[1:40:22] spirit of Heaven heaviness that they
[1:40:24] might be called the tree of
[1:40:25] righteousness the planting of the Lord
[1:40:27] that he might be glorified you remember
[1:40:30] there and then Jesus would take the
[1:40:31] scripture would take the Scrolls there
[1:40:34] there in in the temple I believe and he
[1:40:36] would start to quote this and would
[1:40:38] close it and we say this day this
[1:40:40] scripture is fulfilled and brother
[1:40:42] brandom says he didn't quote all of that
[1:40:45] second verse because it was pertaining
[1:40:47] to a second coming you remember that but
[1:40:49] we're leaving in the day where he's
[1:40:51] coming upon the Earth so that means oh

[1:41:10] atmospheres that comes against your mind
[1:41:12] atmospheres that comes against mamas
[1:41:14] atmospheres that comes against teenagers
[1:41:17] here stands the word of the Lord saying
[1:41:19] I'm giving you a Garment of Praise amen
[1:41:21] I'm giving you a Garment of Praise for
[1:41:23] the spirit of heaviness it's a spirit
[1:41:27] it's the same spirits that would that
[1:41:29] would stand in front of brother brand
[1:41:30] and that fog would come over the person
[1:41:32] is the same spirits today but the same
[1:41:35] word today that was back then is here
[1:41:37] today to let you know that you could
[1:41:40] have a Garment of
[1:41:42] Praise You Can Have a Garment of Praise
[1:41:45] now the Lord is that spirit and where
[1:41:46] the spirit of the Lord is there is
[1:41:48] Liberty that's what we feel in our
[1:41:50] services we don't got a dead letter but
[1:41:52] we got a Living Word what is that Living
[1:41:55] Word it's the same word that said let
[1:41:57] there be light and there was light is
[1:41:59] the same word here today what did that
[1:42:01] light do in the beginning it pushed back
[1:42:03] that atmosphere of Gloom and what would
[1:42:05] happen the Bible would tell us in 2
[1:42:07] Corinthians 4:6 for God who commanded
[1:42:10] the light to shine out of Darkness I
[1:42:13] like how the Bible puts it who commanded
[1:42:15] he didn't say please let there be light
[1:42:17] he commanded for God who commanded the
[1:42:20] light to shine out of Darkness has
[1:42:22] shined in our hearts s and so the same
[1:42:25] God that said let there be light and a
[1:42:27] bright order out of chaos there upon the
[1:42:29] Earth is the same word that is bringing
[1:42:32] order in your
[1:42:33] chaos oh your life may look so chaotic
[1:42:36] right now and all you see is the chaos
[1:42:38] all you see is the heart broke all you
[1:42:40] see is this all you see is that but the
[1:42:43] same God that
[1:42:44] commanded that commanded with authority
[1:42:47] is commanding tonight not me I'm not
[1:42:48] saying me but there's a word that's
[1:42:50] coming across that is commanding the
[1:42:53] heav has to
[1:42:54] leave the heaviness has to leave that
[1:42:57] depression has to leave that anxiety has
[1:43:00] to leave not by me it's the word it's
[1:43:03] the same word that command a light in
[1:43:04] the beginning is the same word you know
[1:43:07] brother brother Brandon Matel us he
[1:43:09] would he would quote a scripture and
[1:43:11] says God or John says the concept of God
[1:43:14] was expressed in Jesus so the very very
[1:43:17] very thing of who God was was there in
[1:43:19] the body of Jesus and here we are today
[1:43:22] the body of Jesus ain't here among us
[1:43:24] but we got the same word the same
[1:43:26] anointing The Same Spirit but the brand
[1:43:29] say the very substance of God was made
[1:43:31] flesh and dwelt Among Us the very
[1:43:34] substance of God was made flesh and
[1:43:36] dwelt Among Us and here we are brother
[1:43:38] Brandon would say that the quickening
[1:43:40] power was come to us and opened up the
[1:43:42] seals and he would say what are those
[1:43:44] Seven Seals he says it's God he says God
[1:43:47] is that are those Seven Seals and that's
[1:43:50] who has been revealed to us in this
[1:43:52] generation is the very substance of God
[1:43:55] let our musicians come
[1:43:57] tonight it's the very substance of God
[1:44:00] he's the one that is bromus creation
[1:44:03] whenever the music's playing the
[1:44:05] creation of Joy is here whenever it's
[1:44:06] not playing the creation of Joy is here
[1:44:10] you see it don't matter what song's
[1:44:11] being played it don't matter if the if
[1:44:13] the drums are playing as long as there's
[1:44:16] a positive
[1:44:17] word I don't care about the music I
[1:44:20] don't care about the sing give me the
[1:44:21] word and we're thankful for those things
[1:44:23] I'm not Downing those but don't let me
[1:44:25] get so focused on these little things
[1:44:27] right that if our if our favorite song A
[1:44:29] being played right oh man I feel down oh
[1:44:32] I'm not going to get into the service
[1:44:34] that's an atmosphere but the devil's
[1:44:36] trying to keep you out of the creation
[1:44:38] of Joy sir when you're at home by
[1:44:40] yourself and you just feel so depressed
[1:44:44] I've been there man I've been there
[1:44:46] fighting complexes fighting insecurities
[1:44:48] fighting these things with this and for
[1:44:50] this and that and this but turn on a
[1:44:53] tape and that brings a creation of
[1:44:56] joy you that's the greatest advice I can
[1:44:59] give you know as me when you stand in
[1:45:01] prayer lines or something and some I
[1:45:03] can't get over this depression I can't
[1:45:05] that's a play a tape whenever that
[1:45:06] whenever those thoughts arise in your
[1:45:08] heart turn on a tape turn on some
[1:45:11] positive things don't listen to the
[1:45:12] negative if there's friends that are
[1:45:14] that are saying negative things do away
[1:45:16] with them I know that may sound harsh
[1:45:19] this ain't the time to be in negative
[1:45:21] this ain't time to speak speak negative
[1:45:24] things this ain't the time to speak the
[1:45:26] devil's thoughts what do Revelation 10
[1:45:29] say go to the angel with the open book
[1:45:31] in hand and say give me the book you
[1:45:34] take and eat and what does the what does
[1:45:35] the Bible say after that you prophesy
[1:45:38] again you go to the angel with the open
[1:45:41] book in hand you take the book you eat
[1:45:43] the book and it shall be be be I think
[1:45:45] the Bible would say it shall be sweet in
[1:45:47] your mouth as honey but bitter in your
[1:45:49] belly but then you're going to prophesy
[1:45:51] again that's the nothing that's the
[1:45:53] positive the devil wants to come and say

[1:47:42] is deity is in your body oh man that's
[1:47:46] why iica brother Brandon describes that
[1:47:48] in order for those seeds to come to life

[1:47:54] darkness you want to be the the Temple
[1:47:56] of the Holy Ghost you got to get past
[1:47:58] that that
[1:47:59] Darkness I've been a teenager it's hard
[1:48:02] I've been there with complexes people
[1:48:05] say something about you say something
[1:48:06] against you it hurts but there's a word
[1:48:11] there's a word that you got to look to
[1:48:13] remember the Bible would talk when God
[1:48:15] would speak to Abraham and would say
[1:48:17] after lot was separated he come and he
[1:48:19] spoke to Abraham and would say now lift
[1:48:21] up thine eyes and look from the place
[1:48:23] Thou Art Eastward Westward northward
[1:48:27] Southward God had given him the
[1:48:30] inheritance but before he could take it
[1:48:33] he had to look from his present
[1:48:35] condition he had to look from where he
[1:48:37] was to what God had promised him you got
[1:48:40] to look from where you are it don't
[1:48:43] matter where you're at this evening it

[1:50:26] condition I'm looking where two or three
[1:50:28] are gathered I will be in their
[1:50:32] midst it was in Second Kings the prophet
[1:50:35] would come and say dig these ditches dig
[1:50:37] these ditches dig this Valley full of
[1:50:40] ditches you're not going to know how the
[1:50:41] rain's going to come but when you get up
[1:50:43] that's going to be full and you notice
[1:50:45] the deeper they dug what water that was
[1:50:47] going to be there the deeper they dug
[1:50:49] they could have dug a little trench but
[1:50:51] that was all the water they was was
[1:50:52] going to get oh Hallelujah you may say
[1:50:55] yep I'm going to throw this out but
[1:50:56] that's all the water you're going to get
[1:50:58] what I say if I have to go to a brother
[1:51:00] and apologize I'm going to do it if I
[1:51:02] need to throw bitterness out I'm going
[1:51:04] to do it I'm digging if I need to get
[1:51:06] some gossip out I want to get it out I'm
[1:51:09] digging I want to see a Revival in my

[1:51:22] they got up on those Valley those
[1:51:24] ditches were full of water and then the
[1:51:26] Lord would say this is but a light thing
[1:51:29] this is a little thing and you know what
[1:51:31] would happen he would give them victory
[1:51:33] over the enemies that was against him so
[1:51:36] the the sacrifice of digging was just a
[1:51:39] little thing compared to the victory
[1:51:42] that was coming oh and I say that that
[1:51:44] the sacrifice of forgiving somebody the
[1:51:47] sacrifice of throwing bitterness out is
[1:51:50] just a little thing to the victory
[1:51:53] to the blessings to the windows of
[1:51:55] Heaven that is going to overtake you I
[1:51:58] said we've come too far to get hung up
[1:52:01] at the security line let's throw it out

[1:52:16] best thing that anybody could give you

[1:52:20] eternal life healing for your body swap
[1:52:22] your weariness for Joy take the Gloom
[1:52:25] away and give you a shout of Victory

[1:53:21] you oh I'm making preparations I'm

[1:53:26] ditches saying God I need something from

[1:53:33] personal let's be personal I need

[1:53:48] now I need you you're you're being
[1:53:50] personal with your anticipation but
[1:53:52] brandom would say if if there's only one
[1:53:54] person in this city that is going to
[1:53:56] make a Rapture around that person that's
[1:53:58] not being selfish that's being expect
[1:54:00] that's under an
[1:54:02] expectation there's only one person that
[1:54:04] gets that gets freedom from anxiety I'm
[1:54:07] that person if there's only one person
[1:54:10] that gets a Deliverance I'm that person
[1:54:13] brother Brandon I say the Bible said he
[1:54:15] ascended upon high and gave gifts unto
[1:54:17] men there was an atmosphere that hung
[1:54:19] over the Earth of Darkness of Gloom of
[1:54:22] death of weariness the prayers couldn't
[1:54:24] even go up because the atonement wasn't
[1:54:27] made but he broke through that Veil he
[1:54:29] opened up the way he broke through the
[1:54:31] veil of sickness he broke the veil of
[1:54:33] sin the veil of weariness he broke the
[1:54:35] veil of depression he broke every Veil
[1:54:38] the veil of
[1:54:40] weariness the veil of weariness we can
[1:54:42] get so tired we all sees the problems
[1:54:45] but he broke through that Veil and said
[1:54:48] here's a creation here's a swapping just
[1:54:51] look from this place
[1:54:53] let's bow our heads
[1:54:55] tonight the Bible would say in 1 Peter
[1:54:58] 1:6 wherein you greatly rejoiced though
[1:55:00] now for a season if need be ye are in
[1:55:04] heaviness that heaviness that we're in
[1:55:06] is just for a season but the victory
[1:55:08] that we're going to take is eternal
[1:55:11] maybe if somebody want to lift up their
[1:55:13] hand and say brother Josh I'm in that
[1:55:14] atmosphere God bless the hands I'm in
[1:55:18] that atmosphere right now all I see is
[1:55:20] the Gloom all I see is the the
[1:55:23] heaviness but God is here to make a
[1:55:26] swap swap that heaviness for for a
[1:55:29] Garment of Praise dear heavenly father
[1:55:32] Lord there's hands all over this
[1:55:34] building
[1:55:35] lord lord they're looking from this
[1:55:37] Earthbound condition to a Heavenly
[1:55:40] Father Lord you've given us a positive
[1:55:42] token that is identifying us with the
[1:55:45] word for this generation that are saying
[1:55:48] let there be light and that atmosphere
[1:55:50] of Gloom has to go Lord we're identified
[1:55:53] with that tonight
[1:55:54] Lord Lord I don't know the situations
[1:55:57] the conditions father but you do
[1:56:00] Lord God I've done my best to surrender
[1:56:02] to you so that you can speak to the
[1:56:04] needs Lord whatever these needs are
[1:56:07] Behind These uplifted Hands I ask that
[1:56:09] you would deal with them Lord touch the
[1:56:12] hearts God if they need a swaer may they
[1:56:15] swap it Lord whatever it is if they need
[1:56:17] to dig ditches may they dig ditches
[1:56:19] father if they need a forgive a neighbor
[1:56:22] May a forgiven neighbor
[1:56:24] father Lord the hardest thing
[1:56:27] sometimes is to look to you and say I
[1:56:30] understand I might not know but I trust
[1:56:34] you God heaviness sometimes can come by
[1:56:36] hurts not knowing why not knowing why
[1:56:39] just like that your Prophet dealt with
[1:56:42] this lady with two miscarriages she had
[1:56:44] she had no control over it God maybe she
[1:56:47] got bitter at you and that's why the
[1:56:49] where this heaviness came from but Lord
[1:56:52] there was was a word that will look
[1:56:53] through it maybe there's somebody here
[1:56:55] that is bitter at you because there are
[1:56:57] some things they had to go through but
[1:56:59] God I ask that this word would Pierce
[1:57:01] through that bitterness and would say
[1:57:03] hey there's a creation of
[1:57:06] Joy whatever the need is tonight father
[1:57:09] I ask that you would speak to him in
[1:57:12] Jesus name Amen in the name of
[1:57:20] Jesus it's power

[2:03:30] every chain every feeling every
[2:03:33] adversity I believe that God has given
[2:03:35] us the ability to break through it
[2:03:37] tonight do you believe that I don't
[2:03:39] thought that was a powerful message we
[2:03:42] get so many troubles up in our life and
[2:03:44] you say brother Matt I want that kind of
[2:03:46] a breakthrough and looking forward to
[2:03:48] what God's going to do in that meeting
[2:03:50] and I'm looking forward what God's doing
[2:03:51] tonight amen what he's doing in hearts
[2:03:54] and lives is isn't that what Jesus said
[2:03:57] when Martha came to him he said Martha
[2:03:59] you're cumbered about much
[2:04:01] serving he said but Martha or Mary hath
[2:04:04] chose that one thing that was needful
[2:04:07] she has chosen the good part that shall
[2:04:09] not be taken from her you know what Mary
[2:04:11] was doing she wasn't doing all the work
[2:04:13] that Martha was doing but she was
[2:04:15] sitting at the feet of Jesus he said and
[2:04:17] she chose the thing that was needful
[2:04:19] that wouldn't depart from her I think
[2:04:21] that's what we ought to do tonight to
[2:04:23] find oursel you said brother M how do we
[2:04:25] break through all that how do we how do
[2:04:26] we make preparation is to sit in the
[2:04:29] presence of the word of God you get
[2:04:31] sitting in the presence of God and the
[2:04:33] atmosphere of God and you'll be able to
[2:04:34] come to church and you'll have a
[2:04:36] breakthrough every service the things
[2:04:38] that you've been cumbered about they'll
[2:04:39] fade away because you're sitting in a
[2:04:41] place and taking the good part that
[2:04:43] can't be taken away from you don't be
[2:04:45] cumbered don't be worried and troubled
[2:04:49] but sit at the feet of Jesus
[2:04:51] take the word of God and push play said
[2:04:54] take a take a tape and put it on when
[2:04:56] you get to feeling bad sit in the
[2:04:58] presence of God and allow God to be able
[2:05:00] to speak their hearts in the presence of
[2:05:02] the word of God and let bitterness and
[2:05:04] worry and trouble let it just fade away
[2:05:07] choose the one thing that is needful
[2:05:09] amen you need him tonight that's what we
[2:05:12] need friends you me me tell you what the
[2:05:13] devil does he'll take every life that
[2:05:15] you'll give him and he'll destroy it and
[2:05:18] he'll take it farther than it ever
[2:05:19] wanted to go a little bit of bitterness
[2:05:22] can take a person's life in in just a
[2:05:24] few in just a few months and years
[2:05:26] sometimes days a little bit of
[2:05:28] bitterness it can take a life to you
[2:05:29] can't even recognize the person that it
[2:05:31] took and that's what Satan wants to do
[2:05:33] with you to put a little bitterness in
[2:05:35] your heart till he could take you to
[2:05:36] your soul you're so tore up and before
[2:05:39] long you're so tore up at everybody
[2:05:41] you'll turn to alcohol and drugs and all
[2:05:44] these things until there ain't nothing
[2:05:46] left of your life it'll be a total wreck
[2:05:49] and the devil will sit there and laugh
[2:05:50] and then he'll leave you
[2:05:52] leave you in that condition he don't
[2:05:54] want nothing good for your life he wants
[2:05:55] to destroy you but I say choose the good
[2:05:58] part that can't be taken from you choose
[2:06:01] the one thing that's needful tonight
[2:06:03] that can't be taken from you and say
[2:06:04] Lord I pray you would have mercy upon me
[2:06:06] am he's a just God he's just to forgive
[2:06:09] God have mercy upon us Lord don't let me
[2:06:12] be found sometimes God allows you to see
[2:06:14] things to say this is where you could be
[2:06:16] Lord don't let me be found in that place
[2:06:19] but let me choose this one thing that is
[2:06:21] needful
[2:06:22] let me find you let me find myself at
[2:06:24] the foot of the cross amen I thank God
[2:06:27] that he reminds us sometimes of the path
[2:06:30] that we could go down but we have a
[2:06:32] positive word tonight that is not your
[2:06:35] path somebody say that with me that is

[2:12:51] him another hand clap of
[2:12:54] Praise amen we just we want to make a
[2:12:57] quick announcement um we had a brother
[2:13:00] Marlo py had asked the church brother
[2:13:03] we've been helping in India and I don't
[2:13:06] know how many that has the bulletin that
[2:13:08] we just started sending out this month
[2:13:10] but we kind of put a a little bit of the
[2:13:12] testimony or what we're doing with their
[2:13:14] Church in India uh but I wanted to make
[2:13:17] uh make it clear tonight and give
[2:13:19] anybody an opportunity that wanted to
[2:13:20] help help towards it uh their Church uh
[2:13:23] you may remember this last year we done
[2:13:25] the same thing but their church is in a
[2:13:27] city that is uh that is tens of millions
[2:13:30] of people and uh they obviously don't
[2:13:32] have the money to own a building uh or
[2:13:34] they even rent a building to have church
[2:13:37] in uh for a week at a time so they
[2:13:39] actually rent the building and for
[2:13:41] several years this is their home Church
[2:13:43] uh this is the brother we've started
[2:13:45] over 50 churches uh with his ministry
[2:13:48] throughout India and they have huts and
[2:13:49] different things that we've helped to do
[2:13:51] and and he's just had a real wonderful
[2:13:53] Ministry there but at their home Church
[2:13:55] they actually rent the building only for
[2:13:58] the hours that they're able to have
[2:14:00] service so they rent the building for
[2:14:01] two or three hours on a Sunday and they
[2:14:03] rent it for a couple hours two or three
[2:14:05] hours on a Wednesday night the rest of
[2:14:06] the time the building is used for other
[2:14:08] things that's the only way they could
[2:14:09] even Gather in that big of a city in
[2:14:11] order to have service uh there's several
[2:14:13] hundred Believers that come together but
[2:14:15] they're very poor people um and what
[2:14:18] this has caused is because of this
[2:14:20] they're not able to have instruments and
[2:14:22] and and the and the you know the Altar
[2:14:24] and different things the the the pull
[2:14:26] pit and things they're not able to be
[2:14:28] kept in the building and so for so long
[2:14:30] these brothers had packed this and they
[2:14:32] took them home and they they they they
[2:14:34] rent Rick Shaws some of them walk them
[2:14:35] home some of them walking two or three
[2:14:37] miles carrying a speaker and would store
[2:14:38] the speaker in their house just to be
[2:14:40] able to have it for service so last year
[2:14:42] we started helping their Church where
[2:14:44] they could rent a storage building that
[2:14:46] was that was put up somebody had a mind
[2:14:48] to turn a building into a storage
[2:14:49] facility right where they had church and
[2:14:51] so we rented them one of those storage
[2:14:53] buildings to put all of the church uh
[2:14:56] equipment in so that on Church day they
[2:14:58] could just go there and then they could
[2:14:59] set it up in the morning and have
[2:15:00] service and so um they they try to raise
[2:15:03] up money each month last year we raised
[2:15:05] money and we just paid for it for a
[2:15:07] whole year uh it's about 23 $2,400 to
[2:15:11] rent that for 12 months uh for the
[2:15:13] storage facility and and and all that
[2:15:15] right there so uh we're going to try to
[2:15:17] do that we we've sent some money there
[2:15:19] to support them uh I've already made a
[2:15:22] commitment to send that and we sent it
[2:15:23] out in the bulletin to let everybody
[2:15:25] know but I just wanted to give the
[2:15:27] church an opportunity that anybody that
[2:15:29] had something on their heart they'd like
[2:15:30] to give toward I believe that God will
[2:15:31] richly bless you uh for doing that
[2:15:33] they're true saints of God and I know we
[2:15:36] get offers all the time uh things online
[2:15:38] people trying to get you to donate to
[2:15:40] things and uh so I'm always cautious of
[2:15:42] that but these are these are Saints
[2:15:44] that's that we worked with and uh for
[2:15:46] many years so if you have something on
[2:15:48] your heart you'd like to give just ask
[2:15:49] you to get with uh brother Morgan or
[2:15:51] brother Phil uh as you go out and
[2:15:53] they'll get that to us and we'll we'll
[2:15:55] add that to our offering to be able to
[2:15:57] send uh to make sure that they are able
[2:15:59] to cover that so we certainly appreciate
[2:16:01] appreciate all you do I know we uh we we
[2:16:04] always we give a lot you already do uh
[2:16:06] and I believe that God has has
[2:16:08] tremendously blessed our church we're a
[2:16:10] giving church we support the missionary
[2:16:12] work we want to see the move of God and
[2:16:14] the work of God uh not just in in our
[2:16:17] area but wherever we can support it
[2:16:18] around the world and I believe that it
[2:16:20] takes of people that dedicated to that
[2:16:22] and I believe that God blesses our
[2:16:24] church accordingly amen and so we
[2:16:26] certainly appreciate all that you do and
[2:16:29] and I know those Saints appreciate it as
[2:16:30] well so God bless you as you go
[2:16:34] tonight we'll take the name of Jesus
