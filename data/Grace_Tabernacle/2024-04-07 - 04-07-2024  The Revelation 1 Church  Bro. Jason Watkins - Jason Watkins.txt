so uh you're my people Amen brother brandham was proud of that I'm glad that um brother brandham had a southern gentleman way and he says in one place he says I guess I just born in Old Reb I'll just die in Old Reb so I sure appreciate that I was up in one time I was up in the north preaching up in Connecticut for um brother Elijah Gibbs you may know him there up in Connecticut and had meetings up there my goodness I'm sure I was the only Southern person in the whole building and I um so I was just introducing myself and and uh Jason Watkins you for South Carolina as soon as I said South Carolina I've seen all them yank Northern people brothers and sisters and they they as soon as I said South Carolina they were just like and I and I saw it and I said hey say what you want to about the south that nobody retires and moves up north just saying and uh they did what you did they laughed and we got a good laugh and that broke the ice and so I appreciated the Lord of lovely lovely people amen we got a family that goes to our church been there for about 15 years and he comes from the north and he wears a big t-shirt around and says I wasn't born in the South but I got here as quick as I could praise the Lord uh I I just counted a great privilege to be here and um known uh brother Matt uh for many years but we've never had a tremendous amount of Fellowship together so amen I I really deeply appreciated the almost instantaneous invitation I received to minister this morning amen and felt good in my heart to do it I know a lot of people in this area got a lot of many many friends amen so we just want to give our uh attention to the word for just a little little bit I'm not a marathon preacher but uh I told Brother Matt usually when I go somewhere uh and it's a Sunday morning I just imagine I'm home and uh so brother Matt said that's perfectly fine so would that be okay if I just imagine I'm home among home folk amen we're going to invite you to stand and turn into the Book of Revelation I apologize for not bringing my Bible I have a travel size Bible but I was trying to get by with just one little carry-on bag and trying to close it I just I I couldn't tell if I couldn't fit it or I didn't want to crush it so I said well I'll just take my iPad and we'll read uh read from that excuse me in uh in Revelation chapter 1 I want to read the first eight verses and I uh then we're going to turn back into the Old Testament for a brief reading amen if that microphone is that's I don't know if that's moving on my face or what uhuh should I bend it out a little bit maybe like that uh okay you might have to adjust okay no amen praise the Lord here all right amen I was preaching um that brother Blue's Church way out in the country it's an all black church and their microphone just went put it was done gone gave up the ghost went to a better world and they didn't have a backup system I said well hey I've preached this message on six of seven continents I preached plenty of times without a microphone I'll just preach without one now you got to preach really loud to to be louder than black folks and I really had to thunder it out there amen praise the Lord because they were running up at the at the helping me helping me and so um we we preached the whole sermon amen my voice knew it when I was finished but we got through it amen so if worse comes to worse we'll just shut it down or switch mics or whatever uh the AV men AV men are funny and particular and you can't they got to be right amen amen thank you s oh use this one all right praise the Lord oh even that sounds better for me praise God all right God bless you Revelation chapter one I want to speak to you this morning um on a on a thought that I've taught on and ministered on many times but always it seems in a different way and I never cease to be astonished at how many different directions the Lord will take me just starting with this scripture reading Revelation chapter 1 brother Brandon preached quite a bit out of the Book of Revelation I believe the Book of Revelation is the bride's book and uh I believe it's uh its Mysteries are for the Bride of this hour and brother brandham taught on it extensively um perhaps as much or more than any other book in the Bible and you don't hear uh Paul quoting from it because the apostle was already gone by the time it comes back um by the time John arrives back with it and so I believe it is um a book for the Bride of the end time now the the really the way that I know that is because when brother brandham went through it and when we read it with correct understanding it matches and dub tals everything Paul taught us amen and there's not anything in the message not not anything not a single teaching that brother brandham did not establish on the apostles Paul's Doctrine amen and so there's no doctrine that we have that is not established in Paul's writings and so I think that that's God's special way of doing it he bookends his ages with prophets puts one in the alpha church and puts another one in the Omega church amen are you thankful for God sending a prophet amen might say a little bit more about that as we go along Revelation 1 we'll read while you're standing verse one the revelation of Jesus Christ which God gave unto him to show unto his servants things which must shortly come to pass and he sent and signified it by his Angel unto his servant John who bear record of the word of God and of the testimony of Jesus Christ and of all things that he saw blessed is he that readeth and they that hear the words of this prophecy and keep those things which are written therein for the time is at hand John to the seven churches which are in Asia Grace be unto you and peace from him which is and which was which is to come and from the seven spirits which are before his throne and from Jesus Christ who is the faithful witness and the first begotten of the dead and the prince of the kings of the earth unto him that loved us and washed us from our sins in his own blood and hath made us Kings and Priests unto God and his father to him be glory and Dominion forever and ever amen behold he cometh with clouds and every eye shall see him and they also which pierced him and all the kindreds of the Earth shall wail because of him even so amen I am Alpha and Omega the beginning and the ending saeth the Lord which is and which was and which is to come the almighty let's pray Master we thank you for your word now there's as the as we read Lord there is a blessing in reading it just reading it and there is a blessing in merely hearing it read so father now may you bless your word bless all the people both speaker and hearer we commit ourselves into your hands now for service Lord It's Your word it's your message it's your people people it's your plan it's your vision lord it's all about you it's all for you it's your glory Lord we're here today just to assist just to be your assistant that's all I am they sang a song I followed you up here that's all I know so Lord here we are and we ask for you to take control of the service in Jesus name amen God bless you friends you can be seated while you're seated I want you to turn with me also to Second chonicles uh verse three I'm sorry chapter 2 second Cor chicles chap 2 and let's read from verse one and Solomon determined to build a house for the name of the Lord and a house for his kingdom and Solomon told out three score and 10,000 men to Bear burdens and four score th000 to heue in the mountain and 3,000 and 600 to oversee them and Solomon sent to heram the king of Tyrus saying as thou D deal with David my father and did send him Cedars to build him a house to dwell therein even so deal with me behold I build a house to the name of the Lord my God to dedicate it to him and to burn before him sweet incense and for the continual shoe bread and for the burn offering brings morning and evening on the sabbaths and on the new moons and on the solemn Feast of the Lord Our God this is an ordinance forever to Israel and the house which I build is great for Great Is Our God above all gods but who is able to build him a house seeing the heaven and Heaven of Heavens cannot contain him who am I then that I should build him a house save only to burn sacrifice before him send me now therefore a man cunning to work in gold and in silver and in brass and in iron and in purple and crimson and blue and that can skill to grave with the cunning men that are with me in Judah and in Jerusalem whom David my father did provide amen praise the Lord now this is an amazing undertaking that Solomon is attempting and he's been commissioned uh to build it by God we know that David desired to build a house excuse me unto the Lord and I apologize for my voice sometimes the U my morning voice is a little rough but I'll get it preached out and it won't bother me at all I promise you I just don't want it to bother you amen I'll preach right through it and blow it out nice and clean amen praise the Lord Lord so Solomon now in building this house you know he's given a commission and the little bit of the backstory to Solomon ending up as the chief builder of course he's the son of David and so David in the fatherhood Solomon in the sunship so you're this is why Jesus Christ was called the son of David because you understand the type he at being the Son of God and you find that David desired actually to build it Solomon is completing the desire of his father when Jesus came he said he was here to do the will of the father he said it's written in the Scrolls concerning me I have come to do thy will oh Lord he lived his whole life to serve the father he said Son does nothing but what he sees the father doing that doeth the son likewise this was a pattern that would exist in the church because Jesus was a prototype of a brand new type of human being born of the word of God he's the beginning of a new creation a brand new type of person and now God is going through Christ to continue the ministry of the son of man into a word body that fills up the Earth and this is exactly why brother brandham could talk about the bride and say that she's the word again made flesh dwelling in the earth that's the ministry of the son of man don't confuse the office of Son of Man man with the ministry of Son of Man the office of son of man is always a prophet that's why Jesus called himself son of man he came as a prophet prophets were eagles they came as as a son of man prophesy son of man that he would say in the Old Testament this is exactly why brother Brandon would refer to Jeremiah and say Jeremiah was Christ now he wasn't Jesus of Nazareth but he was the word coming through a man in flesh and that was the ministry of the son of man the the the M the office of son of man is important because you need a prophet in order to conduct you into the presence of God you can Benny Hinn can conduct you in under the anointing of God you can go to one of those meetings and you can actually feel this was a great mystery that brother Brandon preached that turned the theological World on its ear when he said it's absolutely a true anointing falling on a false vessel but he he was taught that by the Lord when he saw how that the remember the vision he said he I saw the wheat and it was panting for water and the weed beside it was panting for water and the rains came and the wheat and the weed raised up and said praise the Lord praise the Lord praise the Lord because the rain falls on the just and the unjust and so we realize then that excuse me that th that it's not just the anointing that we want to be taken into you can you can you don't even have to be a Christian to be blessed of God by following the word you can pay your tithes and offerings even as a sinner and God will bless you I know Sinners who have learned that secret businessmen who give under the cause of the gospel and God blesses them you can be healed even if you're not a Christian they ask brother Brandon do you have to be a Christian if you if you want to be healed and brother Brandon says no you don't have to be a Christian if you want to be healed but you you need to be a Christian if you want to stay healed see he said bring me a crossy child he said I'll straighten their eyes just by staring at them but of course as soon as they get outside the eyes will go right back cross again because they're just under that anointing I saw you know my drive here today I was finally ready to see a different name I'm glad I saw Grace Tabernacle because I keep seeing Faith Tabernacle and Faith Assembly and Faith this and faith that and I thought you know it's I I I I I I admire them for naming their church that and there's no doubt churches in the message that have that name but I I I know there's a difference between human faith and revealed faith and I know that the revealed faith is a person that the message of the hour is not books and tapes and quotes it's a person it's the person of the Lord Jesus Christ and so this is why we are not a denomination this is why that when you come to Christ you come to a bleeding word and so this is the ability of a prophet to take you into the presence of God you you remember that in the Old Testament just to give you a quick example you find that Aaron who had a Divine call amen he had thus sayith the Lord he was a priest he was in in the he was the tribe he was the high priest God he had a Divine commission but yet if Aaron went into the presence of the shikina if he went into the presence of the pillar of fire without blood he died see he had to have blood and His Garment had to be correct he had to be washed and clean and everything had to be exactly right or he perished but you'll notice that Moses went up the mountain and went in and out of the shikina glory never took a lamb never took a sacrifice never took blood never wore robes never had pomegranates or Bells because we realize that that that Moses as a prophet as a son of man the ministry the office of son of man is a Ministry of atonement and so so you you can you can have Ministry that can take you into the anointing of Christ but it takes a prophet's Ministry to conduct you into the presence of Christ because you have to have a blood sacrifice and this message is a bleeding word sacrifice Hallelujah so when you go into his presence you don't look at your own faults and your own mistakes you look at a blood atonement because you have believed and received the Living God so you find in fact is later on you find that God tells Moses says go down and tell the people don't touch the mountain don't break through unto me because otherwise I would have to slaughter them and that's his people he loved them God loved them but but he couldn't dwell he even told he even told Moses he said I can't dwell among the people cuz I would kill everybody see because I I I'm a holy God and they're stiff necked and they're rebellious and they sin he said I can't dwell among them so I'll send my angel and he will dwell among you see so it's God in a different form that and so Christ wasn't a second person he was the same person see so when you find David standing there Desiring to build a house unto God what was the purpose of the house so that God had a place where he could come and Men could come and they could have restored fellowship and so brother and so this is why Peter said you are a tabernacle you're a living Tabernacle and brother Brandon would preach that you're the living Tabernacle of the living God's presence and we're built up we're Lively Stones built up oh I going to tell you something friends it's wonderful to know the Living God it's wonderful to have have him living inside of you and so we we find that that he says to Moses tell him don't break through and the and Moses said Lord nobody can get up here we build a fence trust me uh I've got everybody at their post the deacons aren't going to let anybody break through and he says Moses go down go down and warn them again and this is the warning that denominational systems are not heeding and they're trying to break into the presence of God without a bleeding sacrifice and what does it do it's bringing spiritual death to them instead of life so he says go down Moses and warn them again not to try to break through to my presence and Moses turns to go down and he says Moses when you come back bring Aaron with you and when he brought Aaron with him they didn't bring a lamb they didn't bring a dove they didn't bring blood they didn't bring robes they didn't bring anything but Aaron was with Moses and he was standing under the umbrella Hallelujah standing under an atonement that's the that's the safety that's the privilege that you have to come boldly into the throne room of God this is where John was privileged to come to come boldly and so he had a he had a true Faith you know you can you can see people how that you know I I I was talking to a man and he was from a uh an Evangelical movement he was very familiar with the the message in fact is quite familiar with it his dad had been a message Minister for years and so he's now following this evangelist in his Lear Jets around the world and he says to me he says he says Miracles were just happen like popcorn and I said well of course I said it it operates off of Faith the disciples were casting out Devils before they were born again the disciples were casting out Devils just because Jesus told them they could and they believed in and it worked I said but then they came up upon a devil they couldn't move and they asked Jesus why he said well because this devil only comes out it's your unbelief you haven't been converted yet I'm here to tell you the power they had after the upper room was far superior to the power they had prior to the upper room so it's not unusual it's it's faith and it moves and so but but it's different when it's a revealed Faith it's beyond just human faith and so it's going to take that revealed Faith to get us in into the rapture this was this was the faith that God was bringing to John on the aisle of patmas a revealed faith when I read the first chapter of the Book of Revelation I cannot wrap my mind around somebody thinking that Jesus was someone other than almighty God when I read those words I say how do you conclude after you read this description of him he's the alpha he's the Omega he's the beginning he's the ending he's the first he's the last I mean my goodness how many Thrones did John see one how many did he see Seated on the throne one I mean how I that that's computable to me I see one on the throne there's one Hallelujah I find out that this one talking to John is the first and the last he's the beginning and the end the Bible in the Old Testament calls him the Everlasting [Music] father so I I am astonished that people Come Away with a a misunderstanding of who Christ was this was the this was the restoration under the of the open door that began at the end of the sixth age moving into that's why brother brandham said the Le to age in some respects could almost be considered an extension of the Philadelphian age after Wesley dies in the 1700s he sets an Open Door otherwise Wesley would have caught that being an angel he sets an Open Door which is a revelation of Christ and there's going to begin the restor ation of the deity of Jesus Christ and you get men in the end of the 1800s getting ready to go into the 20th century you get men like parum and lake and Grant and Seymour and and all of those isua Street fathers they were beginning to catch a revelation of the deity of Jesus Christ and they begin to baptize in Acts 238 they begin to believe that he was the same one God and so it was a it was a growing Revelation and and that's why when brother Brandon would come along he would say I'm I'm like one born out out a season by the time he gets there the church is already straying and it's all just like the early church it it's already straying and and he he's trying to set it back in order he's trying to say we're all one he's trying to restore Fellowship but that eventually that church would put Christ out and and and a prophet would have to come under an anointing of Malachi 4 and say now I indict this generation for the second crucifixion of Jesus Christ and I do so in the presence of the judge see so so you you you have this amazing Revelation that's being poured out and there here John begins brother Brandon when he's teaching on it when he he teaches a lot on it and I don't have time to read all the quotes today but but you can catch brother bram's teaching on Revelations you know 1 two and three and four and five and he he he he takes a lot of time teaching on those subjects he goes through and teaches you know we talk about the ages we talk about the SE he taught on the trumpets a lot of people think he didn't teach on the trumpets because they said well he only taught Feast of trumpets that's actually not accurate he just didn't title it the trumpets but he actually preached on all seven trumpets individually and and and preaches takes a whole week to preach on it and comes to the end of it and says now I think by now you've got a better understanding of those trumpets and if you read the sermons you do you have a tremendous understanding of it so I don't have time to get all in the weeds to that I don't mean to call it in the weeds but where wi the first begotten of the Dead the prince of the kings of the earth unto him that loved us and washed us from our sins in his own blood and brother brandham now says now that first five verses there should be no mistake who's doing the talking it's absolutely Jesus Christ it's none other than the Lord Jesus Christ himself who is now coming because now he has he's been he's been now he went back to being a pillar of fire and he now he understands all things brother brandham talks about in his Earthly Ministry there were things he didn't understand that he didn't know that's right off the tape don't hurl something at me and Jesus talks about that they ask him certain questions and he says only the father knows that and brother brandham says there were things he didn't know in his Earthly time said but then when he ascended on high and he went back he said I come from God I go back to God he went back to the pillar of fire and see that's why brother brandham explains that he says see talk about in MDC he said he knowed all things he said but you bypassed that see you come like me you come like Adam you went from thought to flesh and so Christ in his in in his flesh uh he actually goes and receives a great Revelation they want to know about the coming he doesn't know he tells them he doesn't know there's certain things they ask him he doesn't know the answer he tells them I don't know and brother Brandon points that out many many times on tape and and so you know it's it it's it's amazing that when comes back he now brings a complete revelation of the deity of Christ in these first five verses this is how brother brandham taught it you're welcome to go and check it out yourself that that that once he comes to the end of the fifth verse now he's going to bring a great mystery to the church beginning in verse 6 and hath made us Kings and Priests unto God and his father to him be glory and Dominion forever and ever and so be look it behold he cometh with CLS and every eye shall see him now watch this is not the secret Rapture because every eye shall see him and they also which pierced him and all the kindreds of the Earth shall whail not re can you imagine that you would could you imagine here today that you would see Jesus and you wouldn't Rejoice you'd wail can you IM get your mind wrapped around that but yet we realize that he's prophesying all the way to ur my day to the end time that there that now this Revelation is going to come back to the church at the end time that you also are Kings and Priests you also are part of God you also are part of the word you also are have a portion in God's plan and the world is moving off into judgment and when he comes back it's Revelation 19 the bride is with him riding white horses and every eye shall see him and they don't Rejoice they wait they're afraid they're terrified because they know they've missed it I'm glad on that Resurrection morning I'll know I've made it you'll know you've made it hallelujah oh [Applause] my I didn't say it he said it that you're part of God's godhead that's a strong statement no wonder he could say she is him now see he's not saying she's literally him I didn't die for you you don't baptize in my name you you don't you don't pray to me but she is him she's not literally him she's Mrs Jesus she's the continuation acts I mean Hebrews 138 is the key she's not literally him she's the same as him whenever he comes he's the same yesterday today and forever that's how you know what is the truth because it reproduces the same life and the same power and demonstration of the Holy Ghost Hallelujah so so when you see brother brandom teach on these things he's taking it back to scripture people who don't follow brother brandham listen when next time you listen to a tape just remember brother BR don't understand the missing element and the missing element was expression Jesus was the express image see and this is why this is exactly why brother Brandon would come and he would take a sermon Christ is the mystery of God revealed and he would say now he would he would describe it like this and he would say now he he has in in one place where he talks about how that he he doesn't reveal this great secret of his coming and he says and it's a good thing he has and then in the very next sentence he said he has revealed it in the lives of all the people all down Through the Ages see so it's he said now he said now tonight we're going to look at it and see exactly what it is and when you hear the sermon you realize the whole thing is expression he says God has has only had one goal one goal in all the Bible and he says and tonight we're going to to look at what that one goal is now he cut he he unfolds it in a three-fold way we know that unfolds it in a three-fold way but but his he has one goal and that's expression and he says and he showed it in the lives of all the people in the scriptures no wonder Jeremiah was Christ no wonder David could stand there and look out his window and a and a deep began to call to the deep and he he said behold I live in a house of Cedar but my but my God lives in a tent of skins and he says I want to build a house unto the Lord God and Nathan the prophet standing there and says David the lord loves you you're the apple of his eye you're in his heart do all that's in your heart for the Lord is with you later brother brandham says the Lord comes to the prophet and says now go back to David what you told him wasn't wrong but it can't go like he thinks because go and tell him David you can't build me a house now when you read the story out of First Kings you you don't or out of second uh Second Kings I think you don't it doesn't tell you why that David can't do it you have to Samuel didn't record that but when you go to the Chronicles when Ezra is writing the chonicles he records actually why David couldn't do it and the reason was is because he had been a bloody man he had killed too many people he had been a man of war a man of Vengeance a man of judgment and so David is what is David expressing David is the deep is calling to the Deep David is the father he's in the fatherhood and he has a desire to have a tabernacle where where communion can take place again oh Hallelujah where Fellowship that had been lost in the garden can be restored because that's what the father wanted but he says to David David you're like me you've killed lots of people you've been of judgment you've been of Vengeance your sword is bloody you can't build it but I'll raise up your son and I'll call his name peace Hallelujah and he it is who will build a temple and Christ the son of David is now a tabernacle where God and man are united again so then now we become the continuation of that exact same creation you get me you're you're with me you see the how we're unfolding this so so David is expressing the desire of God now here comes Solomon and what David is allowed to do is he's allowed to assemble all the parts all the pieces all the quarried all the wood all the trees but Solomon gets there and says my goodness my father has divided all the elements to build the temple but I don't know how to put it together now watch now he's now he's expressing the humanity see here's Christ even in his own Humanity there's certain things that he doesn't even have he's not privy to certain things until he goes back to the pillar of fire and now he knows all things and now he can bring the Revelation to John it's hard it's difficult to absorb and very hard to get our mind around the fact that you today because of the end time message which is a restoration of the whole mind of Christ that you today in your Earthly Journey understand more of the plan of God than Jesus actually did during his Earthly Journey things that he was unclear on you've already had the clear he's clear about it now because now he it is humanity went back to God and now that Revelation is brought to the church he brings it to John to give to the churches oh Hallelujah friends no wonder we need a message people say we don't need a message what how in the world are you ever going to know God without this message this thing isn't just a a retelling of a historical event from 2,000 years ago the world loves that story they're willing to worship that Jesus but Paul said my fear is that you'll worship another Jesus that I have not preached about and that's what the whole people say oh I just want Jesus I don't need a I don't need the message I don't need a prophet I just want Jesus I just say which one they say oh well there's only one I said not according to St Paul Paul was worried you'd worship another Jesus of manmade theology man-made invention organized human human Rel uh human organization and that's not Jesus and in fact his that that's the SE that's the secret that brother brandom said that will lead you to the mark of the beast and when you actually see Jesus you won't be rejoicing you'll be wailing because you realize you crucified Christ when you crucified the word because he was the word you believe it because you're a part of the word it's it's it's native to you the the truth is native to you it's it's that nature in the gene of God it wasn't the nature you were born with you were born with a fallen nature Paul taught us that we all at one time had our conversation in the lust of the flesh the things of the world and we were by Nature the children of Wrath even as others but I'll submit to you today that wasn't your original nature that's the nature you were trapped under your original nature was Zoe life and when an eagle screamed you responded why why do you believe because you can't not that's my favorite double negative I can't not believe Hallelujah so why you believe because I'm a Believer why do you say Amen to the word well there's parts of it I don't understand but there's some guy inside of me screaming amen amen amen amen there's an amen man inside of me do you have an amen man inside of [Applause] you so he comes here and he says you know he so Solomon now is saying you know send me therefore man showing this human Frailty you know it's it's good to always remember that that when you because a lot of times people get confused on the godhead and it's it's the very first thing that the gnostics began to attack in the early days of the early church that was one of the first things they begin to try to disconnect they tried to separate Jesus from the word and because if they can do that then it's an easy thing to get you to a trinitarian ideology or get you to miss the word or get you to accept some organized religion so they started the gnosticism the gnostics started attacking it and so that's why you know even in our own message ranks and we you had you had you know you got deity camps and you've got two Soul camps and you've got the and and all that is is re it's just reheated gnosticism if you understood the church history it's just reheated gnosticism is all it is and so they' they've been attacking the deity because if you can't understand the relationship between Christ and the father you're never going to understand your relationship between yourself and the word and that's why it's an expression and so so we find out that that that you know when when you get a trinitarian the problem is that when they come they because they don't understand expression that in their formula they divide God into three persons now of course you get the argument these days and I had one man say it to me one time I was trying not to laugh but he was a doctor of divinity and he says uh the Trinity the Trinity is an uh what was the word he used a real fancy Dr Divinity word um it's a it's a non-negotiable the Trinity is a non-negotiable you believe it to go to hell and I said William Bram he said William bram's in hell today because he didn't believe in the Trinity and all the the people are in hell today cuz they follow him they don't believe in the Trinity I said and he said that on the air on his radio show and and well that was just a little more than I could take brother Matt so I called him up on his show and I said that's an interesting thing you said about William brandham that's right I said I stand by it I said well I'm trying to figure out you said that that William brandham didn't believe in the Trinity he said that's correct and I said well who who told you that he said well he said I I said you ever in his meetings no you ever follow his teachings no I said well I have for all my life I said I've preached I preached this message I started preaching it as a teenager I said I've preached it all around the world and I said I can tell you right now he certainly did believe in the Trinity you're completely Mis misinformed and boy you told about somebody get nervous cuz now he said this to millions of people over the air and he said well I I I I I well I I I was told you know by my asso I said well they misinformed you pal I said he certainly believed in the Trinity I said now and I waited for just a little bit of effect you know you like to twist it a little bit and so I you might not but I do and so uh I said now he didn't believe in the Catholic version of the Trinity but he certainly believed in the Bible version of the Trinity he said what's the difference I said well the Catholic version is three persons in one God the Bible version is one God in three offices and I said he believed that his entire Ministry and brought a great revelation of it you see the the problem is that they that they don't understand the key is expression this is what Paul taught us is what brother brandham was teaching us in Christ as the mystery of God revealed and so so we find that that that the trinitarian and it's in interesting you know and he he says that if you don't believe in the Trinity you can't go to heaven and I'm like well okay first of all I'm not sure if you were sleep in history class I know you went to Dallas Theological Seminary but the first of the first writings of the Trinity wasn't actually a trinity because it didn't even include the ghost they didn't think he was a person at all it was just between the Son and the father and it took hundreds of years just to get to that and then many more hundred of years to they said oh we better include the the Holy Ghost too he's also now they got a third one seem like every time you you you come to a new understanding they want to add another person to the godhead and so we we realize that that in that that the the formula of the trinitarian is that it chops God into three individual persons and that's wrong that's that's ancient Babylonian polytheism hot proved that and but then you say well then the Oneness well the problem with the Oneness is they see it as Jesus only they they they don't they the Oneness don't see his body his bride his church as a part of it it's just Jesus only but the the real truth is is is right down the middle you say oh it's two no brother REM says in Paradox as soon as you figure out it's two you've also missed it it's not two Lords that's not correct so what we find because they're missing expression also and that's gnosticism also because they wanted to diminish the deity of the Flesh of Jesus Christ by even denying that he came in the flesh because look if the gnostics could prove that Jesus actually what they taught was that he was maybe like an angel appearing as a human or he was some Supernatural Apparition and the reason that they wanted to believe that according to irenius who let them have it man no wonder brother brandham picked irenius as the second Church age messenger that dude was nasty I mean he called right to their face you're the Sons of Satan he didn't pull it he punches you're the Sons of Satan and and and I mean this is exactly why John is writing to all the churches we must we whoever will not confess that Jesus is coming the flesh is Antichrist John's fighting gnosticism already in the church the spirit of antichrist does already work in the churches and the other Apostles are writing letters to the churches we need to earn earnestly content for the faith once delivered I'm glad this message is the faith once delivered it brings back the presence of God it brings back the power of God it brings back the body of Christ in the [Music] earth and so they don't they don't the Oneness don't see his body his bride his church and this is why brother brandham would call us actually part of his godhead because they're missing expression you know when you let me just let me just help you with this before I move on I got to watch my time but but listen when you when you read in the gospels and you're reading passages that deal with really really sharply about the humanity of Jesus he's standing in the water and a voices speaking out of the atmospheres out of the heavens it says in the King James and brother brandham finds that amusing that people would try to say oh well see voice was speaking from heaven and brother Ram said friend there's Heavens between you and me it's just atmospheres a voice spoke out of the atmosphere didn't mean that a voice was speaking somewhere on ala centor echoing shouting down to the Earth that's silly and and and and so so we find out that you you get those kinds of times you get times where Jesus is weeping where Jesus is saying physician heal thyself and he can get sick and he can have a headache and you get all of these different times where he people say oh he's praying and they would ask brother Brandon well who's he praying to and brother Brandon would say well who do you pray to you're praying to the God within you yes you have the you have him in you yes I thought you said he was in heaven uh wait yeah the whole thing becomes a log Jam see and the whole reason that they get jammed up is because they're looking at it in a humanistic way and they're ignoring expression the whole thing is about expression it's about you becoming the living Tabernacle of the living God's presence that's the hidden Mana the hidden Mana is all the way through the ceaseless ET ities the Eternal unfolding the revelation of Jesus Christ it's unfolding in you right now it's going to soon bring the sleeping Saints for hundreds of years when the when the when this church will experience a refilling of the Holy Ghost the Dynamics of this church will be a refilling of the Holy Ghost and the Saints for hundreds of years will come up out of the ground and we which are alive and remain shall be changed in a moment and so I was I was saying to a group of Bible study one time I was teaching a Bible study I said listen just remember when you're reading the the parts of the gospels that that are dealing very closely with the humanity side of Christ you say well was he God or was he a man yeah I mean which one was he mhm well God or man correct see when when brother now you're getting it when brother Brenham is describing him he Compares him to Solomon he says see just like Solomon was the son of David but brother brandham goes on to say he said now he was not exactly like Solomon he says because Solomon was just a man said but Jesus was a man plus comma he was the god man man told you he's a brand new type of human he's a prototype for a coming Kingdom of the increase of his kingdom there shall be no end see the UN brother Braham said how else are you going to make the scripture The unsearchable Riches of his glory it's in the hidden Mana it's in the ages to come see brother Ram said they had a an application of it in the ages I'm getting ahead of myself they had an application of it in the ages but it's also an eternal application the hidden Mana is an eternal application so let me finish this point before I jump to that so so at times you're reading about the humanity side of Christ now he's don't think of him as 50% man and 50% God that's not correct he's a 100% a man and he's 100% God he's the God man you get me see so so when you're reading passages that deal so closely with his Humanity listen church that's not to confuse you that's to Blind the world that's never to confuse his family he sent us prophets and apostles to establish the doctrine that the Lord is one and that and that Christ is a further expression he was a he was that great Fountain and then he became the pillar of fire and then he became MDC and then you don't hear no more of MDC because he became Jesus Christ he was the pillar of Fire that led the children of Israel A Cloud by day a fire by night he's the same one that appeared in Houston Texas in a pillar of fire over a prophet's head amen he's the same one that opened the seals he's the same one that lives in you what is it you're the living Tabernacle of the living God's presence so when you read when you're reading his Humanity just remember that didn't come to confuse you that when you're reading his Humanity that is for you a blueprint or a road map when it would be your turn to be the word made flesh you get me it's a blueprint it's a road map it's a schematic it's it's it's plans and specs Builders know what that is that's what it is when you're reading in the gospels about his Humanity it's not to confuse you it's to inform your thinking so that you understand how God wants a human to act when he's indwell by the Holy Ghost it's Hallelujah friends you're the continuation of it that's what the ministry of the son of man came to bring in this world the continuation that's why the seals were open to bring back the token to bring back the abstract to bring back the living fullness to bring back a body a a body that she is him a final voice to the final age see there's no way to get there without without a prophet first you can't get a bleeding word for his presence that the scriptures replete with examples of that you can't you can't even you you you there's no way to have reconciliation without blood and because we're to participate I mean that's that's the that's the sixfold purpose six purposes of Gabriel's visit to Daniel to to bring reconciliation amen and and that's part of the process and this is exactly why that Jesus would say that you're part now look how you're part of it whosoever sins John 20 whosoever sins you retain or remit they are remitted or they are retained now we don't have a Catholic version of that where we put on a robe and get in a confessional Booth frankly your pastor doesn't want to hear your sins he if you try to tell him your sins he'll say go tell it to somebody who can do something about it I can't forgive it or omit it but there is one who can do both Hallelujah Go Tell it to Jesus see and so so we find that that we we can see we're a part of that we can see that we have a a part in the Kingdom of Christ we can see that we're a final voice to the final Age We you can see that we are partaking in the you know in and not only remitting sins but finding the last seed to find the last seed only one can do that as Christ but how's he doing it through you brother brandham dealt with this in the fourth seal when he he actually takes in one paragraph and mingles the church the Gentile church and Moses and Elijah to the Jews and in one paragraph he starts talking about you know they can close the heavens they can control nature whatever they say now it's not clear in the fourth seal but in the Sixth Seal he D circles back to that and says now that's Moses and Elijah but in the fourth seal the beginning of that paragraph starts about wait till that seven Thunder Group arise who can hand the word not handle the word but hand the word who you are the hand you are the expression you are the extension of almighty God and he's blending them together now that makes perfect sense to me because we know that when the bride goes up then the the eagle anointing lifts up in the atmosphere it flies East it picks up Moses and Elijah and it takes this same message of Christ the deity of Christ and takes it to the 144,000 they receive the Holy Ghost they receive the message they receive a new birth that's why they're in the Millennium so it makes sense to me it's all part and partial of the same thing only God working through Gentiles and working through [Music] Jews I my iPad went off a long time ago I don't have any notes showing but I'm just this is okay so so we find then that this whole concept now uh when when he's coming back and he's he's making you a part of it you're literally a part of the end time word you're literally a part of the end time plan in your life in your daily walking talking life this isn't somewhere some just some theory in the misty blue this is supposed to live behind skin see this is the hidden Mana you can't there's no way to get a bleeding word outside of a Ministry of the son of man there's no way to get the hidden Mana outside of that because brother brandham showed us that if you notice in the Bible that the hidden Mana is to the angel it's not given to the people it's given to the angel and brother brandham says it's a little higher understanding of him and it's given to the messenger who then turns and feeds it to the people you understand the revelation of the Hidden Mana the thing that's going to change your body you can't study and go to Bible school and get the hidden Mana it only came you say I don't I don't believe in a messenger I believe I can get Christ good luck with that because I'm here to tell you the hidden Mana it's hidden it's hidden only Aaron could go in there it was in a golden pot it only came to one ordained man that's why you're in the order of MDC because you're behind the veil you're in the presence of the shikina you're feasting on the hidden mana and whoever won't come in with you can't get it you understand so it's it's what's you're eating your way to a body change this is why Divine Healing Works brother brandham said in the inner Veil which I think they later titled to why people are so tossed about brother Brandon preaches there and he says if you're sick who you got who's who's who's got a sickness in the body today of any kind you got anything the devil's bothering you physically on praise the Lord mostly healthy church God bless you brother brother Matt power of God must move here brother brandham says if you're sick he said just reach around into that golden pot pull you out some of that hidden Mana start eating on it pull up the word of God by his stripes I'm Healed Hallelujah by those wounds oh the devil would like to take back those wounds it's too late he can't reverse time thanks be to God he already suffered he already died he already Rose he already ascended he already sent back his life I got it you got it the devil is already it's already too late I tell him that all the time sorry it's already you're already too late if you arrived right now you arrive it's already too late I've already been sealed in hey you can't stop it nothing can separate me from the love of God even I can't separate me in Christ Jesus so so we find then that Solomon is going to build him this this Tabernacle of the living God's Dwelling Place a place where God and man can be in fellowship and so so quite naturally then Satan realizing according to the scripture who he happens to believe brother brandham said he believes oh he's a Believer he goes church one of the most faithful said he believes see said he knows what God he knows the will of God he just refuses to do it he said Satan believes that's direct quote he said but he's not born again he's not born again he believed say oh if you just believe he said the devil believes the Apostle says that you believe even one God says so does the devil you fear and tremble so does the devil you do well the devil does the same thing see so so you so we find out then then that he he realizes that that just believing just a a a belief in a 2,000 year ago historical event that's one thing but do you receive him now I had a a man who said to me he' preached the message for 10 years walked away and he says I all I need is Calvary I said really that's interesting all you need is Calvary M yeah that's it uh what about the resurrection oh well yeah yeah I need that too yeah and uh the Ascension uh yeah okay yeah I need that too yeah okay keep coming uh the Holy Ghost well I've got it when I believe so does a devil I said okay stop I said go with me just let I'm I'm going to tell you a story and just go with me vicariously just imagine you're reading a book and you're reading about that day on Calvary and there's John there's Mary there's Christ on the cross and I said and you're standing there oh I like that he said good good you like that okay I said and uh you're you're a believer in him yeah absolutely you believe completely absolutely and I said would he be your lord absolutely what would would you have 100% of faith in him absolutely that he's that that he's forgiven your sins and you're going to heaven absolutely I said all right now that's not bad the thief on the cross held that and he made it to Paradise I said but now let's go on down the road a little bit kind of like Apollos did now let's imagine that you start going around after his resurrection Ascension he sends his Spirit back into the church you hear about the upper room and you go around Peter and John and James you hear them start preaching and you sit in the audience like a Critic and go nah mm- nah you know I just need Jesus I don't need Peter oh you're a good guy I don't need your Doctrine John thank you you're sweet and loving but I I I was I was I I just want Jesus I said do you I said at the day of judgment do you think Jesus is going to let you into his kingdom because you said I just believe Jesus but you rejected his Apostles you think you could believe Jesus and re do you think you would really believe him and then reject his Apostles first of all you wouldn't the the fact that you received his Apostles and Prophets proved you were a Believer amen there are lots of people who believed him when he was having running a social services program but as soon as he started calling their their kind old priest a devil then they didn't walk with him anymore I'm going tell you something friends my faith far exceeds my understanding I know whom I have believed I know whom I have believed I know what he's done in my life so it's Satan's job then to interrupt the process of you becoming the Tabernacle of the living God's presence and how does he do that he comes into our lives and he he contaminates man I sure need one quote if I could get to it uh no that's not it here's oh here it is the very one all right what is the Holy Ghost you like it now we know that when a body is healed that makes us all happy because we know that it definitely shows that our God heals the sick glad for that but that sick person if they live long enough will perhaps be sick again maybe with the same disease they were healed of and that doesn't take away healing so you could be healed today get sick of it again next week or next year and would that mean that God is a liar no it just means you're in a body that's of Flesh that's dying see the doctor will give you medicine for pneumonia and maybe two days later you'll die with pneumonia after he's pronounced them well it reoccurs again watch this but when the soul is healed you have then in you eternal life now you've passed from Death to life you can never come into the Judgment see you're you're now you're part of the first resurrection according to St John 524 so but now watch what brother brandham goes on to say and I believe that we are so close to the coming of the Lord Jesus that it behooves us to do all that we can possibly do to bring every soul to the kingdom and I love this one brother Matt and to bring the kingdom to the people but watch what he says that we might be healed of our spirits I believe that the body of Jesus is the sickest body that I know of that is the body spiritual body of Christ on Earth is very sick now he's just admitted that it's a born again person that they've been born again in the soul but they're still very sick and that sickness is in their spirit because you're a triun in being the sickness might be in your body the sickness might be in your spirit the sickness might be in your soul when you're born again your soul is healed eternally the new birth is healing of the Soul amen and because it's life healing is life and that's why brother Ram said it's just God giving you a little part of the resurrection and it heals your body it affects you the body and generates new cells and Bones get healed and Cancers vanish we just had a sister in our church had a had a very uh concerning very large um tumor on her breast and she come up for prayer and I knew the devil was just trying to fill her full of fear and so I I prayed two ways out loud I prayed first of all that that the Holy Spirit would condemn the enemy that I was praying against him and the second thing I prayed is that her faith would be strong to not fear or doubt she went to the doctor to get a biopsy when they went to give the biopsy right in front of the doctors right in front of their images right in front of their screens it vanished and they couldn't find a trace of it and they were astonished the doctors were amazed it's gone we don't even see a a casing we don't see anything it's just gone God still moves God still heals and so so we realize then that sometimes the devil puts things in our lives and I I heard a good friend of mine who is a fisherman of course we're all fishermen of men he's a minister but you know you know brother Bram talked about John talked about snakes and scorpions and serpent because that's what he saw in the wilderness David talked about Still Still Water and things like this cuz he saw that in in the wilderness and so this buddy of mine he he's he's a big time fisherman although he says he don't hardly get to do it anymore I'm not sure I believe him but but he he was talking about you know there's nothing worse going fishing and get a hook in you man it's painful and you somebody just wants to pull it out you got to go wait oh wait hold on this got to there's a certain way that's got to come out you understand fish hooks science it it goes in easy it doesn't come out easy and so we find then a lot of times that what does the devil do you know he he begins to watch us brother brandom says he can see a child when it's born he can I don't know fully know how brother Brandon was ambiguous a little bit we can't go beyond what he taught us but somehow the devil knows you know the Bible says he's wiser than Daniel and he can see gifts and he's a he knows who to be afraid of and he starts watching and he says a lot of times brother brandham says see he was trying to kill that that child prematurely cuz down the road God's got to work for it the devil knows it and see so he know he knew someday you'd be a believer he knew he he knew that he wanted to try to keep you in a barroom or keep you wherever your denomination was a barroom or a church or wherever your denomination was it was all just organized the Satan was still the god of it you understand and so he spends his whole life trying to keep you away from the living presence of God and and he en he kind of writes you know he ensures that even if you do get there and he loses control of you into the Holy Ghost he'll still keep hooks in your spirit and people deal with that kind of stuff they deal with besetting sins they can't get over they deal with things in their psychology they I'm not a psychology preacher I believe in the power of God but I but brother brandham taught on these things and this is just one quote of many hundreds where he talks talks about he says you know the your soul is one thing your body is one thing but now we need healed of our Spirits because the church is sick what is he trying to do he's trying to make you an ineffective Temple he's trying to make you an ineffective Tabernacle that happen it happens in marriages it happens in homes it's okay brother Matt it happens in home I'm a pastor this is what I do it happens in homes it happens in marriages men get raised under a certain ideology from their parents parents or or maybe Society puts a certain kind of thinking on a man puts a certain kind of society puts a certain kind of thinking down the life you can't if i wife I'm a Believer and you really are but I really am and you really are but I've had an experience you really have but I got the Holy Ghost I I love the Lord and you really do then then why can't I beat this thing why can't I get over it why do I have this problem why do I deal with anger why do I deal with unforgiveness why do I deal with lust why do I deal I don't know what your problem is today but I know the the one who can fix it is here hallelujah sometimes friends just want to say just get personal with you just for a moment sometimes you know when when the I I find when I'm dealing with with marriages and I can see that they both love the Lord that's not in question the problem's not in their soul the problem's not in their body problems in their Spirit there's something there I can I find sometimes that that teenagers have problems and you know who put the hooks in them their parents who had hooks in them who got put in it by people with hooks in them you have friends that put hooks in us as you're growing up afflicted by the influence of brother brandom said afflicted by the influence of wrong people who had wrong motives who did wrong things things that trapped Us in Wicked vices and they keep manifesting themselves as besetting sins that's why Paul said lay aside those things See You Can't Be an Effective Temple You Can't Be an Effective uh Champion for the Lord You Can't Be an Effective Soldier he's not just here to heal your soul and your body he wants to release your mind to believe every [Applause] word sometimes hooks get in and I and I'm just I'm just going to be careful here I know I'm in in another man's pull pit and and I don't say this with any regard to anything here I don't know anything about anything here I just want to say what the Lord put on my heart sometimes people get hooks in their Spirit from former pastors who had hooks in them who got them put in there by their former their former and their former and you see Satan is just constantly putting hooks in us and that way if he loses control of your soul he he still has that hook and he's trying to trying to keep you you from being the kind of a temple that God needs you to be people sometimes who assaulted us or evily mistreated us and they had hooks in them also you know sometimes assaults and offenses that were committed against our minds or against our bodies and now we are assaulted and and the offenses and the hooks have trapped Us in unforgiveness and you wonder why can't I get this thing out of my life you never will with that unforgiveness cuz that's a hook Satan has sunk a triple hook deep into your spirit and listen there's only two unpardonable sins I know you think there's one there's two the one is to blaspheme the Holy Ghost there's no coming back from that but the other one is the refusal to forgive Jesus said you're hly father will not forgive you of your trespasses if you don't forgive others of theirs sometimes we get these Hooks and we we live in unforgiveness we live in besetting sins we live in weaknesses we don't understand sometimes that we get hooks put in our spirit you know and and then sometimes if we're not careful we put hooks in other people who we love you're getting quiet that's fine it's a serious matter friends I want you to know the emancipator wants to take every hook out of you right now wants to take every hook out of his bride he doesn't want you hooked with besetting sins he doesn't want you hooked with unforgiveness he doesn't want hooks in your Spirit say Lord take all the hooks out of my spirit you've I've already passed from Death to life I've already believed your word I want all this thing out of my mind I want I want to have the spirit of forgiveness I want to have the spirit of love that person that did that to me they had Hooks and somebody put those hooks in them who put it in them who put it in them who put it in me and maybe even now I put
