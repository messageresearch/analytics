[42:16] come to get something from me you've
[42:17] came to the wrong place I don't have
[42:19] nothing to give amen but in the word is
[42:21] life amen I just pray that the Lord
[42:24] would come and anoint the word of God
[42:25] that he could minister to our hearts and
[42:28] brother Mark we uh you can't make people
[42:30] come to church and sit on the edge of
[42:31] their seats but I know what the Bible
[42:33] says the Bible says they that hunger and
[42:35] thirst after righteousness they shall be
[42:37] filled blessed are they that hunger and
[42:39] thirst I wonder how many this morning
[42:41] could say I come hungering and thirsting
[42:44] after the words of life amen it's the
[42:46] very thing that'll take us into a
[42:47] Rapture it'll heal our bodies it'll give
[42:49] us strength it'll it'll pick us up
[42:52] whenever we're down it's the words of
[42:54] eternal life amen I wonder if if we
[42:56] could just tap into our soul this
[42:57] morning to find that there's a need
[42:59] there and to draw from God and say Lord
[43:02] let me receive something from you this
[43:04] morning amen amen why don't we just bow
[43:07] our heads this morning as we get ready
[43:09] to open the word of God and maybe
[43:11] there's something in the word and you
[43:13] just need the Lord to come by and speak
[43:15] to you and just let everything else go
[43:17] and just have a a moment with the Lord
[43:19] and let all the questions all the thing
[43:22] just Let It Fade Away just give it to
[43:23] him this morning say Lord would you come
[43:25] and speak to my heart
[43:26] could each one of us ask in the name of
[43:28] Jesus Christ Lord how we come before you
[43:31] this morning and Lord we know the
[43:33] weakness of our flesh and the failures
[43:35] that we have and Lord I I realize Lord
[43:38] the the the inability Lord when I stand
[43:40] before a body of Believers that are
[43:42] charged and Lord here they come in
[43:45] expectation to receive something from
[43:47] you and Lord how it makes us realize
[43:50] that we don't have anything to offer
[43:52] Lord outside of the word of God and Lord
[43:54] but I pray Lord this morning morning
[43:56] that you would take the gift that you've
[43:57] placed in our life and Lord I ask you
[44:00] Lord that you would allow me to
[44:01] surrender Lord may I give everything to
[44:03] you this morning and Lord I don't have
[44:05] nothing that I would want to say but God
[44:07] may you take this voice and speak to
[44:09] your children and God may you put a
[44:11] desire in the hearts of the Believers to
[44:13] pull from the word of God and Lord may
[44:15] you come in a supernatural way Lord God
[44:18] we we we realize these are a great
[44:20] people it's the Bride of Jesus Christ
[44:22] Lord and I believe it this morning that
[44:24] she's deserving of hearing from the
[44:26] master and Lord not to hear from me but
[44:28] to hear from you and God we give you the
[44:30] Liberty this morning to be able to speak
[44:32] and we'll give you the glory for all
[44:34] that's done and said in the name of
[44:36] Jesus Christ we ask amen amen my
[44:40] goodness won't we just invite you to the
[44:43] scripture to the Book of Genesis in the
[44:45] 18th chapter we're going to start in the
[44:47] first verse and it's kind of a lengthy
[44:48] reading uh but we'll just go uh quickly
[44:51] through it and and just want to say this
[44:54] morning I sure appreciate appreciate the
[44:57] the brother's help yesterday had a lot

[45:28] Timothy but it's brother Tim the pastor
[45:31] at in the evening light Tabernacle
[45:33] becoming and doing the uh the service
[45:36] there so just look forward to having
[45:38] them with us how many's looking forward
[45:39] to that meeting amen so we want to read
[45:42] this morning out of Genesis the 18th
[45:44] chapter and the Bible says and the Lord
[45:46] appeared unto unto him speaking of
[45:50] Abraham in the plains of mamry and he
[45:53] sat in the tent Door In the Heat of the
[45:55] day and he lifted up his eyes and he
[45:57] looked and lo three men stood by him and
[45:59] when he saw them he ran to meet them
[46:01] from the tent door and he bowed himself
[46:03] toward the ground and he said my Lord if
[46:06] now I have found favor watch how he
[46:08] answers them all of a sudden here they
[46:10] are appearing he says my Lord if now I
[46:13] have found favor in thy sight pass not
[46:16] away I pray thee from thy servant let a
[46:19] little water I pray you be fetched that
[46:20] you could wash your feet and rest
[46:22] yourselves under the tree and I will
[46:24] fetch a morsel of bread and comfort your
[46:26] hearts after that you shall pass on and
[46:28] therefore are you come for therefore are
[46:30] you come to your servant and they said
[46:32] so do as thou Hast said and Abraham
[46:34] hastened unto the tent unto Sarah and
[46:37] said make ready quickly three measures
[46:39] of fine meal knad it and make cakes upon
[46:41] the herth and Abraham ran unto the herd
[46:43] and he fetched a calf tender and good
[46:45] and he gave it unto the young man and it
[46:47] hasted to dress it and he took butter
[46:49] and milk and the calf that he had
[46:51] dressed and he set it before them and he
[46:53] stood by them under the tree and they
[46:54] did eat and they said unto him where is
[46:57] Sarah thy wife and he said behold in the
[46:59] tent and he said I will certainly return
[47:03] unto the cording of the time of life and
[47:05] lo Sarah thy life wife shall have a son
[47:07] and Sarah heard it from the tent door
[47:10] which was behind him now Abraham and
[47:12] Sarah were old and well stricken in age
[47:15] and it ceased to be with Sarah after the
[47:17] manner of women therefore Sarah laughed
[47:20] within herself saying after I am waxed
[47:22] old shall I have pleasure my Lord being
[47:25] old also and the Lord said unto Abraham
[47:27] wherefore did Sarah laugh saying shall I
[47:30] of assurity bear a child which am old is
[47:34] anything too hard for the Lord at the
[47:37] time appointed I will return unto thee
[47:39] according to the time of life and Sarah
[47:42] shall have a son then Sarah denied
[47:45] saying I laugh not for she was afraid
[47:48] and he said no but you did laugh and the
[47:51] men rose up from then and they looked
[47:53] toward Sodom and Abraham went with with
[47:56] them to bring them on the way and the
[47:57] Lord said shall I hide from Abraham that
[48:00] thing which I do seeing that Abraham
[48:02] shall surely become a great and mighty
[48:04] nation and all the nations of the Earth
[48:06] shall be blessed in him for I know him
[48:09] my isn't that good isn't that something
[48:11] wonderful for the Lord to say about a a
[48:13] man he said for I know him that he will
[48:16] command his children and his household
[48:18] after him and they shall keep the way of
[48:19] the Lord to do justice and judgment that
[48:22] the Lord may bring upon Abraham that
[48:25] which he had spoken of him and the Lord
[48:27] said because the Cry of Sodom and
[48:30] Gomorrah is great and because their sin
[48:32] is very Grievous I will go down now and
[48:35] see whether they have done all together
[48:38] according to the Cry of it which is come
[48:40] unto me and if not I will know and the
[48:44] men turned their faces from th and they
[48:46] went toward Sodom but Abraham stood yet
[48:50] before the Lord and we'll just ask the
[48:52] Lord to add his Blessing to the reading
[48:54] of the word this morning as you take
[48:56] your seats Abraham stood yet before the
[48:59] Lord now last uh Sunday we had started
[49:02] on this subject on the nature of Elohim
[49:04] and I I you know we've been several
[49:07] Brothers fellowshipping around about it
[49:09] this week and it's certainly been on my
[49:11] heart and and uh but I just thought
[49:13] there was so much power in this word and
[49:15] and the Revelation that lies in this
[49:16] last week uh we had had went through the
[49:19] name Elohim and the attributes that that
[49:21] came with it and the Very nature of
[49:23] Elohim being the nature of God and uh we
[49:25] we found this this word Elohim actually
[49:27] first appears in the Bible in the Book
[49:29] of Genesis in the beginning God it's the
[49:32] first time that God has ever talked
[49:33] about it's the first time he's ever
[49:35] wrote about brother Mark but it says in
[49:37] the beginning God created the Heaven and
[49:39] the Earth that's the word Elohim in the
[49:40] beginning Elohim and and of course you
[49:42] realize that this word Elohim is so much
[49:45] of a better fit for the word god than
[49:47] the word that we use in the English
[49:49] language see uh he said see uh the word
[49:51] God to us means an object of worship so
[49:54] when we talk about God anything could be
[49:55] a God if you've ever been overseas or
[49:57] I've been many missionary trips in India
[49:59] and there's so many different gods
[50:01] everything anything that grows out of
[50:02] the ground can be a God if the Stag TI
[50:05] in the cave was a God I I literally
[50:07] watched with my own eyes as children and
[50:09] men and women knelt down and bowed down
[50:11] in a cave and and put uh money and put
[50:13] flowers and put it on the on the
[50:15] stalagmite and the stalagtite and and
[50:18] here they're worshiping something that
[50:20] they that they don't understand how it
[50:21] got there but but but to them it was a
[50:23] God to them and so the word God is not
[50:25] enough to call God because it can be so
[50:28] many things but butam said see but the
[50:30] word Elohim is a different word he said
[50:32] see because Elohim means the
[50:34] self-existing one he says see so these
[50:37] Gods like if you wanted to make the
[50:38] piano a god well the piano couldn't be
[50:40] self-existent it could be a God to
[50:42] somebody but it could never be a
[50:44] self-existent it couldn't it couldn't
[50:46] exist without anything else it has to be
[50:48] something has to make it or it had to
[50:50] have been created it had to been made in
[50:52] such a way so he says see this word
[50:54] Elohim that Moses had wrote In the
[50:56] Beginning Elohim is a better word for
[50:58] God because Elohim God can mean anything
[51:02] but Elohim can't mean that way because
[51:04] it is God that always existed he was a a
[51:07] self-existing god brother Mark he
[51:09] existed when there was no air he existed
[51:11] when there was no light it was there was
[51:13] no creation there was no stars there was
[51:15] no Earth there was no soul system or and
[51:17] I understand as a body of Believers when
[51:19] we use the word God we're actually
[51:21] referring to Elohim we're not referring
[51:24] to uh has people would would Loosely use
[51:26] this word as a God or God but but in our
[51:28] hearts we may not say the word Elohim
[51:30] but when we say God as Believers we're
[51:32] referring to Elohim we're referring uh
[51:35] to the self-existing god the one that
[51:37] created the world the one that made the
[51:39] the stars and the universe and the
[51:40] heavens and the Earth that we live in
[51:41] but we realize that God is self-existing
[51:44] he was in the beginning he was God Alone
[51:46] brother David he was alone with his
[51:47] thoughts and and although that may be
[51:49] hard to comprehend because we're
[51:51] creatures of time it's hard to
[51:53] understand that Elohim in the beginning
[51:55] had no no beginning because everything
[51:56] in our life is is has a beginning and
[51:59] has an end it has a a life and it has a
[52:01] death it has a start and it has a stop
[52:03] so our our nature is is where does it
[52:06] come from and what is the beginning of
[52:07] it but Elohim he had no beginning he was
[52:09] a self-existent God he was here before
[52:12] there was anything that was made it was
[52:14] a before anything existed and and we and
[52:16] and last week when we had started on
[52:18] this we had went into the word Elohim
[52:20] and how that Elohim was a plural word
[52:22] and so and and whenever we read this it
[52:25] actually would show us Moses's
[52:27] revelation of the name Elohim in that
[52:30] Moses knew he had a revelation from God
[52:32] that every characteristic that God had
[52:35] was in the name Elohim so even the the
[52:37] theologians today when they would speak
[52:39] of Elohim they say it's plural so there
[52:40] must be more than one God he must be a
[52:42] father and a son and a holy ghost he
[52:44] must there may be three Gods because
[52:46] after all Elohim was a plural word but
[52:48] but we realize that it wasn't that the
[52:50] plurality of Elohim it wasn't the the
[52:53] different gods but it was the nature
[52:54] that was in God God he was a father he
[52:56] was a son he was a savior he was a
[52:58] Healer he was the very attributes of God
[53:00] and so so we re we realize that Moses
[53:03] had a had a revelation of what Elohim
[53:05] was so when he very first starts to
[53:07] write yeah how many knows Moses wrote
[53:08] the first five books of the Bible and so
[53:11] as he's writing these B uh books here
[53:13] Moses was a prophet of God inspired by
[53:16] the word of or inspired by God brother
[53:18] Mark and by inspiration he caught the
[53:20] revelation of the name Elohim the very
[53:23] first time it's ever written down in
[53:24] history was by a man named Moses he had
[53:27] a he had to have a revelation of God
[53:29] when he wrote In the Beginning Elohim in
[53:31] the beginning Elohim a created light in
[53:33] the beginning Elohim he made man in the
[53:36] beginning see Moses had a revelation of
[53:38] who God was and but Mark that that very
[53:40] Revelation that Moses had is how that he
[53:43] would recognize God when he saw him in a
[53:46] burning bush here when he had no feature
[53:48] of a man when he when he was just a
[53:50] voice in a bush but because he had an
[53:52] understanding of who God was and he had
[53:54] a he had a knowing that God was was was
[53:57] in his attributes and that God he may
[53:59] not come he didn't come in the same form
[54:01] every time that a man saw him and so he
[54:03] would be able to recognize him in a
[54:05] burning bush and and when Moses would
[54:07] come to the bush notice how he so knew
[54:10] that it was God brother Joe that he
[54:11] would be he would ask God the question
[54:13] he said God show me thy glory and the
[54:16] Lord would answer back he said thou cast
[54:18] not see my face for no man shall see me
[54:21] and live brother Mark he knew that he
[54:23] was there he knew he was in the presence
[54:26] of a supernatural God in so much that he
[54:28] said God show me your face but he said
[54:30] no man can see my face and live oh my
[54:33] isn't it something that God would reveal
[54:35] to his Prophet what no man knew here was
[54:38] a man brother Wesley that was hundreds
[54:40] of years after creation or thousands of
[54:42] years after creation down through
[54:44] Abraham and the children of Israel and a
[54:46] nation that was born and they had went
[54:48] into bondage of Israel now here comes a
[54:50] man named Moses it wasn't the F first
[54:53] man on the Earth but he was the first
[54:54] man that that God came to speak to to
[54:56] begin to reveal the secrets of the
[54:58] hearts of God that he could write it
[55:00] down in a book that we could read it
[55:01] today you realize brother Mark he was a
[55:03] man that was revealed to the very
[55:06] mysteries of God it was a prophet that
[55:08] God revealed to him and and as he begin
[55:10] to write these first five books you we
[55:12] we we read it as the books of the Bible
[55:14] the Hebrews the Israelites they read it
[55:16] as the Torah that's what they call the
[55:17] first five books and or or maybe some
[55:19] would refer to it as the laws of Moses
[55:22] but nevertheless it's the oldest record
[55:24] that we have and it's the only record of
[55:27] the creation came from God speaking to a
[55:30] prophet hear me now somebody the only
[55:33] record of creation that we have comes
[55:35] from God Elohim speaking to a prophet of
[55:38] God that he would be able to take the
[55:40] Revelation that God gave him and write
[55:42] it down that we would even know what
[55:44] creation was or where we came from or
[55:46] how we existed or or where or or or
[55:49] where our end shall be even even David
[55:51] would write about it all through the
[55:53] Bible you'll find this to be the case
[55:55] that it was a revelation that came from
[55:56] God given to his prophet and the Bible
[55:58] would say David when he would talk to
[56:00] Solomon notice how he said it he said I
[56:02] charge uh or to keep the charge of the
[56:05] Lord Elohim keep the the charge of God
[56:09] but notice when he would talk about the
[56:11] charge of God that would come to Solomon
[56:13] he said keep his Commandments keep his
[56:15] statutes keep his judgments keep his
[56:17] testimonies as it is written in the laws
[56:19] of Moses so here David would even
[56:22] recognize that the very words that Moses
[56:25] wrote were not Moses's words they
[56:27] weren't the thoughts of Moses they
[56:28] weren't just an inspiration of Moses but
[56:31] it was the very charge of Elohim it was
[56:33] God the Creator that had came down and
[56:36] spoke to his prophet and had given him
[56:38] direction for the church and for the
[56:39] people of God David said but keep the
[56:41] charge of the Lord Elohim keep when as
[56:44] it's written down in the laws of Moses
[56:46] for he would write in Psalms 103 David
[56:49] say because God has made known his ways
[56:52] unto Moses Now isn't that something to
[56:55] hear that God made known his ways unto
[56:58] Moses I thought that was quite striking
[57:01] because when Paul would talk about the
[57:02] ways of God listen what Paul would say
[57:04] in Romans 11 he said God's ways are past
[57:07] finding out but here David would write
[57:11] that God revealed his ways unto Moses
[57:14] Paul would say God's ways are past
[57:16] finding out but David said but God made
[57:19] known his ways unto Moses let me tell
[57:21] you friends what this is is that God's
[57:23] ways are beyond our Understanding God's
[57:25] ways are past our searching and and it's
[57:28] past our digging you can never be able
[57:30] to find it out you could study all you
[57:31] want to You'll Never Find the ways of
[57:33] God you can dig all you want to you can
[57:35] take the greatest ministers and the
[57:37] greatest theologians and the greatest
[57:39] pastors and brother Mark you can dig
[57:40] into the word of God and you'll never
[57:42] find out the ways of God because the
[57:44] Bible would tell us that the only way
[57:46] the ways of God would ever be made known
[57:48] would be first revealed unto a prophet
[57:51] of God for Amos said he said surely the
[57:53] Lord God will do nothing unless he would
[57:55] first reveal his secret unto his
[57:57] servants the prophets and brother Mark
[57:59] that ain't just for the past that ain't
[58:01] just for the present it's for the future
[58:02] it's for everything that God has ever
[58:04] done he said I'll never do one thing
[58:07] unless I reveal it first unto my servant
[58:09] the prophets that's the ways of God and
[58:11] the ways of God cannot change that's the
[58:13] only way that we would know the ways of
[58:16] God brother Wesley is it would come
[58:17] through the mouthpiece of a prophet of
[58:19] God that you and I could believe it by
[58:21] faith God made known his ways unto Moses
[58:25] they wasn't made known to the world but
[58:26] he revealed them to Moses that's the way
[58:28] that we would have access to the ways of
[58:30] God was through the mouthpiece of a
[58:32] prophet listen to how brother R say he
[58:34] said see God works in mysterious ways
[58:36] his wonders to perform and they're past
[58:38] finding out but then the next words he
[58:41] said to the carnal mind God ways are P
[58:45] finding out in another place God's ways
[58:47] are pass finding out intellectually
[58:50] they're past finding out to the mind
[58:52] they're past finding out intellectual
[58:55] you see the you see the difference that
[58:57] don't mean that it couldn't that the
[58:59] that the ways of God wouldn't be
[59:00] revealed unto the hearts of the believer
[59:03] listen he says see if you could explain
[59:04] the ways of God then you wouldn't have
[59:06] to walk by faith anyone if anyone could
[59:08] explain God it would not be necessary to
[59:10] have faith because you know that's the
[59:12] way we walk we walk by faith so we
[59:14] accept the word of God we don't reason
[59:16] it out we don't try to reason it because
[59:18] you can't reason because God's ways are
[59:20] past fing out you can't reason God you
[59:22] don't know him by knowledge hello
[59:24] somebody that's the way the whole world
[59:26] is trying to find God you're trying to
[59:28] you come to church after church after
[59:30] church trying to get a grasp on God and
[59:32] trying to to find out who he is and and
[59:34] find a relationship with God but you'll
[59:36] never know God by knowledge you'll never
[59:38] be able to meet him that way you'll
[59:40] never have communion with him that way
[59:41] you'll never have a relationship with
[59:43] God by knowledge you don't know him by
[59:45] knowledge you don't know him by
[59:47] education you'll not know him you'll not
[59:49] know him by anything that a man could
[59:51] give you but the only way to know God is
[59:53] to know God by faith but remember say
[59:55] this he said it's unreasonable to
[59:57] believe that you could reason out God
[59:59] is't that a statement it's unreasonable
[1:00:01] to believe that you could reason out God
[1:00:03] that you could understand God by
[1:00:05] reasoning or the knowledge of a man this
[1:00:07] little finite mind that you can't even
[1:00:09] use it for for 20 minutes in a service
[1:00:11] before it floats off out in the
[1:00:12] wilderness and it goes to the job it
[1:00:14] goes to the house project it goes to the
[1:00:16] problems at home it you can't even focus
[1:00:18] it on the word of God for a few minutes
[1:00:20] to be able to receive something for God
[1:00:21] for for for just a few minutes at a time
[1:00:23] that's how fin our mind is and to think
[1:00:26] that that little mind that we have I
[1:00:27] know some of you maybe think you got
[1:00:29] great big ones but it ain't no bigger
[1:00:30] than the next guys that little mind that
[1:00:32] we have brother Mark it will never
[1:00:34] understand the ways of God the only way
[1:00:36] to know God is by faith you can't you
[1:00:38] can't you can't just you can't just hear
[1:00:40] it you have to accept it and accept it
[1:00:42] by faith here brother in a prayer line
[1:00:44] he would begin to talk about the ways of
[1:00:46] God he said he said he had a lady come
[1:00:48] up to the prayer line he said Do you
[1:00:50] believe the Lord she said his mighty
[1:00:52] works are past finding out listen he
[1:00:54] said believe believe people his presence
[1:00:56] is here his mighty works are past
[1:00:58] finding out but he Reveals His secrets
[1:01:01] to his servants so the ways of God the
[1:01:03] only way to know the ways of God would
[1:01:05] be through the servant the prophet not
[1:01:07] only does he say it brother Mah but then
[1:01:09] he would prove it he said the only way
[1:01:11] to find the ways of God is he would
[1:01:12] reveal his secrets to his servants and
[1:01:14] then he turns right around after making
[1:01:16] this statement here's a woman that is
[1:01:18] standing in the prayer line after making
[1:01:20] this statement he proves the very
[1:01:22] statement that he says he says how do
[1:01:24] you do sister you believe me to be a
[1:01:26] servant of God with all your heart do
[1:01:28] you believe it you've had a lot of
[1:01:29] trouble haven't you I'm not reading your
[1:01:31] mind but you realize you're in the
[1:01:32] presence of something besides a man
[1:01:34] isn't that right you had an operation
[1:01:35] there's a tumor or something you had it
[1:01:37] you had it again in this time the Lord
[1:01:40] Jesus is going to make you well are you
[1:01:42] believing that with all your heart the
[1:01:43] Lord Jesus is here she says amen that is
[1:01:47] exactly the truth I had a tumor and the
[1:01:49] tumor came back and here a man of God
[1:01:51] would stand before now how would the man
[1:01:53] know the man didn't know it but the God
[1:01:55] that was the god of Elohim the very same
[1:01:58] God that spoke to Moses the same God
[1:02:00] that's in the Bible that the world has
[1:02:01] put in a history book somewhere stood
[1:02:03] before this same woman and said but the
[1:02:05] secrets of God are revealed to his
[1:02:07] servants and he began to tell her the
[1:02:09] things that was going on in her life
[1:02:11] brother Mark and then as she began to
[1:02:12] walk away he said hey just wait a minute
[1:02:15] he said you have been healed before
[1:02:17] that's right he said you were in the
[1:02:19] prayer line last night and the Lord
[1:02:20] healed you from that he said it's gone
[1:02:22] from you right now you're standing here
[1:02:24] and it's already gone from you he said
[1:02:26] but you got something else on your heart
[1:02:29] I see a man walking away from you it's
[1:02:31] your husband he left you two years ago
[1:02:34] and you want to ask him to return is
[1:02:36] that right sis well may the Lord grant
[1:02:38] it in the name of Jesus Christ here
[1:02:40] friends before an audience of thousands
[1:02:42] of people that would sit around and
[1:02:44] people hundreds and hundreds of people
[1:02:46] through a prayer line one after the next
[1:02:48] after the next that a gift of God would
[1:02:50] begin to discern the hearts of people it
[1:02:52] wasn't mind reading it wasn't mental
[1:02:54] telepathy as the newspapers would write
[1:02:56] about it it was the very Elohim God
[1:02:59] speaking through a man and giving the
[1:03:00] very Discerning the heart of a little
[1:03:03] woman that had a need from God friends
[1:03:05] it ain't no dead God that we serve he's
[1:03:07] still the same God he's the same
[1:03:09] yesterday today and forever he proved
[1:03:11] what he quoted let me tell you friends
[1:03:13] this may be a bold statement to some of
[1:03:14] you but William bram's Ministry was the
[1:03:16] greatest Vindication that Moses ever had
[1:03:19] the world searches for the Vindication
[1:03:21] of Moses they go digging in the trenches
[1:03:23] and they look in the Red Sea and they're
[1:03:25] trying to find a wagon wheel that they
[1:03:26] could even believe Moses they'll they'll
[1:03:28] try to find something that well there
[1:03:29] maybe there's a a left of a spear of one
[1:03:31] of those Egyptian armies and they go
[1:03:33] digging around in the dirt trying to
[1:03:35] find something that they could vindicate
[1:03:37] who Moses was but friend that'll never
[1:03:39] vindicate it you could always say it
[1:03:40] came from another age but this message
[1:03:42] that we hear today brother Wesley is the
[1:03:45] greatest Vindication that the Bible has
[1:03:47] ever had you say how can you say that
[1:03:50] because the message is the very thing
[1:03:52] that defends it you don't don't you
[1:03:53] realize this Bible has been in the hands
[1:03:55] of men for 2,000 years let me tell you
[1:03:57] what they done with it they divided one
[1:03:59] another they killed one another they
[1:04:01] destroyed what was written in it they
[1:04:02] used this Bible as an excuse for war
[1:04:05] they've used the word of God as an
[1:04:07] excuse for murder they've used it as an
[1:04:09] excuse for Bloodshed but when the spirit
[1:04:11] of the Lord fell upon a prophet of God
[1:04:14] brother Mark and anointed him to reveal
[1:04:16] the secrets of the hearts of God it
[1:04:18] Vindicated the very scriptures that you
[1:04:20] and I read today no longer is it just a
[1:04:23] good story
[1:04:24] no longer is it just a a bedtime story
[1:04:27] or children's literature no longer is it
[1:04:29] a dead letter but I say this morning
[1:04:31] that the Bible has came alive brother
[1:04:33] the market ain't just something that we
[1:04:35] read but it's came alive Hebrews 13 and8
[1:04:38] it means something to me today cuz he's
[1:04:40] the same yesterday today and forever oh
[1:04:43] it's a very Vindication in Mark 16 that
[1:04:46] they lay hands on the sick and they
[1:04:47] shall recover it proves what Apostle
[1:04:49] Paul said that the letter kth but the
[1:04:52] spirit of God giveth life
[1:04:54] it's God alive it's a very Vindication
[1:04:58] of the word of God let me tell you what
[1:04:59] it was you think about when Moses went
[1:05:01] to the burning bush what was the burning
[1:05:02] bush The Burning Bush was a Vindication
[1:05:05] of what God told Abraham he said of
[1:05:07] assur your your uh children will go into
[1:05:10] a Strange Land and they'll be they'll be
[1:05:12] bound for 400 years but then I will
[1:05:14] bring them out with a mighty hand now
[1:05:17] Abra or Moses stands before a burning
[1:05:19] bush and God shows him he's vindicating
[1:05:22] the very thing that he's that he told
[1:05:24] Abraham Moses wasn't there when God
[1:05:26] spoke to Abraham but Moses wrote about
[1:05:27] it how did he know you answer me he was
[1:05:30] a man just like you and I he had a wife
[1:05:32] and children how did he know God came
[1:05:34] and spoke to his prophet and he told him
[1:05:36] what happened in the beginning things
[1:05:37] that we wouldn't even understand the
[1:05:39] ways of God without a prophet of God but
[1:05:42] he spoke and then the Burning Bush
[1:05:45] brother Mark it Vindicated the very
[1:05:47] thing that God had told to Abraham watch
[1:05:51] can we just take it on down through the
[1:05:52] scripture watch when Joshua go goes to
[1:05:54] to to to to Jericho to the walls of
[1:05:56] Jericho whenever he met the captain of
[1:05:58] the host and he said are you for me or
[1:06:00] against me he said he said I am the I am
[1:06:03] the captain of the host he I I'm the I'm
[1:06:05] the one that that gave you the the right
[1:06:07] to be here let me tell you how you're
[1:06:09] going to overcome this battle brother
[1:06:10] Mark don't you realize that the very
[1:06:12] presence of the captain of a host was a
[1:06:14] Vindication of the burning bush Joshua
[1:06:17] wasn't at the burning bush but when he
[1:06:19] met God in the in as a the captain of
[1:06:22] the host it was a vindication to Joshua
[1:06:25] of what happened at the burning bush you
[1:06:27] see this carry on all the way through
[1:06:28] the Bible as they would go into the
[1:06:30] promised land and here God would raise
[1:06:31] up these great prophets like Isaiah and
[1:06:34] Malachi and they would they would they
[1:06:35] would do the very things of God but
[1:06:37] notice in the New Testament as we turn
[1:06:39] the page in the New Testament John the
[1:06:41] Baptist was a Vindication of what
[1:06:43] Malachi 3 said he said there's coming a
[1:06:46] one and he'll he'll come and he said
[1:06:48] he'll make way the or make U make the
[1:06:50] path straight for the way of the Lord he
[1:06:52] he'll prepare the way of the Lord and
[1:06:54] John the Baptist brother Mark when he
[1:06:55] stood on the banks of the river he was a
[1:06:57] Vindication of what Malachi said
[1:06:59] whenever Jesus was born in a manger he
[1:07:01] was a Vindication of what of what Isaiah
[1:07:04] said behold a virgin shall conceive and
[1:07:06] bring forth a child friends and whenever
[1:07:08] the the children of God went into the
[1:07:10] upper room and the baptism of the Holy
[1:07:12] Ghost fell in the upper room it was a
[1:07:13] Vindication of the resurrection of Jesus
[1:07:16] Christ you can follow that same Elohim
[1:07:18] from The Book of Genesis all the way to
[1:07:20] the day that we live in today and the
[1:07:22] Very Holy Ghost is a vind ation of Jesus
[1:07:25] Christ let me tell you a secret friend I
[1:07:27] know the world today they don't want
[1:07:28] nothing to do with this kind of
[1:07:30] preaching they don't want nothing to do
[1:07:31] with the baptism of the Holy Ghost they
[1:07:33] don't like this Holy Ghost kind of
[1:07:34] preaching but let me tell you a secret
[1:07:36] the Holy Ghost is the only Vindication
[1:07:38] of Jesus Christ that they're ever that
[1:07:40] there ever was it's the very thing that
[1:07:42] proves that he's alive and well it's the
[1:07:44] very thing that he still heals the sick
[1:07:46] it's still it still raises the dead it
[1:07:48] still sets our path stay and it'll lead
[1:07:50] us and guide us into the Rapture by the
[1:07:53] Holy Ghost it's a Vindication listen
[1:07:56] it's a Vindication of the Resurrection
[1:07:58] now the people of God brother Mar now we
[1:08:00] can stand in the middle of a faithless
[1:08:02] generation and we can have faith we can
[1:08:04] have faith for healing because it's been
[1:08:06] Vindicated we can have faith for a
[1:08:08] Rapture because it's been Vindicated my
[1:08:09] friends I don't know how people do it
[1:08:11] how do they go through this world with
[1:08:13] no Vindication how how they go through
[1:08:15] the world with story with no Vindication
[1:08:17] friends I don't know about you but
[1:08:19] Vindication is what brings Faith it's
[1:08:21] the very thing that stir your heart when
[1:08:23] you see Vindicated it it's a foundation
[1:08:26] that you can stand on and be able to
[1:08:27] look the devil in the eye and say you
[1:08:29] have no
[1:08:30] right Vindicated by God we can stand
[1:08:33] brother Mark you think about what it
[1:08:35] took what did it take for Israel to come
[1:08:37] out of Egypt it took a word Prophet to
[1:08:39] come that God would reveal to and he
[1:08:42] would go to them and begin to call them
[1:08:44] out of this place Egypt now notice this
[1:08:45] name Elohim of the mark it ain't
[1:08:47] referring to multiple gods it's it's the
[1:08:49] attributes or the nature of God to see
[1:08:51] inside of him was the nature to be a
[1:08:53] father he was self-existent but there
[1:08:55] was nothing for him to be a father of
[1:08:58] inside of him was the nature to be a God
[1:08:59] but a god is an object of worship but
[1:09:01] there was nothing for him to be a God
[1:09:03] over inside of him was the nature of a
[1:09:06] Healer but there was no sick to be
[1:09:07] healed but it was still part of the
[1:09:09] nature of
[1:09:10] God but but after a while said see so
[1:09:14] there's nothing to worship him there's
[1:09:15] nothing to be healed nothing to be saved
[1:09:17] but here in him brother Mark think of it
[1:09:19] even the word Yahweh that we use the
[1:09:21] Lord it was part of the nature of God
[1:09:24] but there was no one to be Lord over it
[1:09:26] couldn't be Yahweh over anyone there was
[1:09:28] no one to be Lord over but it was still
[1:09:30] the attributes of God inside him see
[1:09:33] because he had these things and his
[1:09:35] attributes and his nature produced what
[1:09:38] there is today so the very desire think
[1:09:41] about God that created to feel the
[1:09:43] desire of being a savior and a Healer
[1:09:45] and a father and a god whenever God
[1:09:47] created us brother Mark he he created us
[1:09:49] to satisfy his own nature isn't this
[1:09:52] something that God want wanted a son so
[1:09:54] he made you he wanted daughters so he
[1:09:56] made you he was a Healer he would never
[1:09:58] be able to heal anyone if there wasn't
[1:10:00] sick but the sick came God healed him
[1:10:02] he's been able to display the very the
[1:10:04] attributes the the the greatness of all
[1:10:07] that God really is it would never be
[1:10:09] displayed if there wasn't no sick and if
[1:10:10] there wasn't no the trials and if there
[1:10:12] wasn't no problems and if there wasn't
[1:10:14] no if we didn't have all these things
[1:10:15] that we go through God would never be
[1:10:17] able to even display the greatness of
[1:10:19] who God is amen we look at it so much
[1:10:21] it's such a a negative and all the trial
[1:10:23] and problems and look at the nation and
[1:10:25] the everything falling apart but this is
[1:10:26] the way that God can display the
[1:10:28] greatness of who God is listen at
[1:10:31] Abraham the Bible says the Lord appeared
[1:10:33] unto him in the plains of mammory he sat
[1:10:36] in the door of the tent In The Heat Of
[1:10:38] The Day He lifted up his eyes and he
[1:10:40] looked and three men stood by him when
[1:10:42] he saw them he ran to meet him at the
[1:10:43] tent door and he bowed himself on the
[1:10:45] ground and he said my Lord if I have
[1:10:48] found favor in thy sight pass not away
[1:10:52] from thy servant amen man can you
[1:10:54] imagine Abraham brother Mark here was a
[1:10:56] man that knew God he knew him by Vision
[1:11:00] or dream or how that God had spoke to
[1:11:02] him when God come and called him out of
[1:11:04] his land of his home and called him into
[1:11:06] this Strange Land so God had he had
[1:11:08] interacted with him he had spoke to him
[1:11:11] in some way that God had dealt with his
[1:11:12] heart but he was a man that because he
[1:11:16] recognized God that whenever he came
[1:11:18] into the tent or to the tent that he act
[1:11:21] he immediately knew him by his presence
[1:11:25] isn't it something he may not seen that
[1:11:27] the face he may not but he knew him by
[1:11:29] his presence can you imagine what it was
[1:11:31] like for Abraham that day here he was
[1:11:34] out in the wilderness had his family and
[1:11:36] the servants that they had raised up and
[1:11:38] trained they they fought battles even
[1:11:40] with them and here he was sitting in the
[1:11:42] door of the tent In the Heat of the day
[1:11:44] but Mark out in the middle of that that
[1:11:46] Wilderness and that and that that great
[1:11:48] that great heat up there hund and
[1:11:49] something degrees and out there maybe
[1:11:51] him and Sarah sitting over by the tent
[1:11:53] and and long day is gone by and they're
[1:11:55] kind of watching how things are going
[1:11:57] looking over at at the little herd and
[1:11:59] everything that they had out there and
[1:12:00] brother Wesley and just pondering on the
[1:12:02] promises that God had made it had been
[1:12:04] many years since God had came and gave
[1:12:06] that promise to him but here as he said
[1:12:08] and they pondered on this things is you
[1:12:10] no doubt he's a human being and and just
[1:12:12] like us maybe we sit there and say you
[1:12:14] know what it's been a long time and it
[1:12:16] it kind of maybe you forget about him
[1:12:17] maybe go a few days and you forget about
[1:12:19] the things that God has told you or
[1:12:21] dealt with your heart on and and so as
[1:12:23] he would as he would think on these
[1:12:25] things all of a sudden the Bible says
[1:12:26] all of a sudden then these three men
[1:12:28] appeared unto him oh my can you imagine
[1:12:31] here he was thinking about God and he
[1:12:32] was he was thinking about the promise
[1:12:34] that he made and all a sudden there he
[1:12:35] stood I thought my is that is that can
[1:12:37] you imagine just sitting in your room or
[1:12:39] at home and think about the promises
[1:12:41] that God made you and he he promised me
[1:12:42] I'd be well and he promised uh I'd have
[1:12:45] a body change he promised we'd see our
[1:12:46] loved ones again and while you're
[1:12:48] sitting there and you're thinking on the
[1:12:49] Promises of God you you look out the
[1:12:51] door and there he stands on the front La
[1:12:54] this is what happened with Abraham he he
[1:12:55] was a man and as he stood there all of a
[1:12:58] sudden God was standing in his presence
[1:13:00] and the Bible said here Abraham he ran
[1:13:02] and he fell on the ground and he said my
[1:13:04] Lord he recognized Brother David he
[1:13:06] recognized the presence of God here he
[1:13:08] said my Lord in other words it was a man
[1:13:11] standing in his midst but it was a man
[1:13:13] that Abraham called God he he said my
[1:13:15] Lord he he he's the same one that he met
[1:13:18] when he came out of the slaughter of the
[1:13:19] Kings remember that day when he went
[1:13:21] down and he fought and he delivered lot
[1:13:23] out of the hands of those of those kings
[1:13:25] and and when he went down there on the
[1:13:27] way back from the battle here melaz didc
[1:13:29] the king of Salem the king of Peace the
[1:13:31] one that had no beginning of days and no
[1:13:33] ending of nights it wasn't just some
[1:13:34] priest that was some Earthly priest but
[1:13:36] it was God it was mecdc it was God In
[1:13:39] the Flesh of a man that met him there
[1:13:41] the Bible says that Abraham he paid a
[1:13:43] tenth part of his SPS to him in other
[1:13:45] words he paid tithes unto mecaz you see
[1:13:48] see it was the same Elohim it was the
[1:13:50] same God that he had met and now here he
[1:13:52] is brother Mark he's standing before him
[1:13:55] that's right he's standing before his
[1:13:56] tent door yeah and he's fellowshipping
[1:13:59] with him and he sits down and he has
[1:14:01] communion with him and as he's communion
[1:14:03] with him and the other angels that were
[1:14:05] with him they said well we got a work to
[1:14:06] do and they went down into Sodom but the
[1:14:08] Lord stayed with Abraham and he began to
[1:14:11] reveal the secrets of the hearts of God
[1:14:13] and as they go down the Angels you know
[1:14:15] the story they went down into into Sodom
[1:14:17] and and they went and they went and they
[1:14:18] found out the the condition of Sodom and
[1:14:21] they brought lot out of Sodom and then
[1:14:22] the Bible say says and after lot left
[1:14:24] out of Sodom immediately then fire and
[1:14:26] brimstone fell on the city and it
[1:14:28] destroyed the city now watch this this
[1:14:31] very picture come on now because Jesus
[1:14:34] he picks this story up in Luke 17th
[1:14:36] chapter 28th verse he says likewise also
[1:14:40] as it was in the days of lot they did
[1:14:43] eat they drink they bought they sold
[1:14:45] they planted they builded but the same
[1:14:47] day that lot went out of solom it rained
[1:14:49] fire and brimstone from heaven and
[1:14:51] destroyed them all Jesus is refering
[1:14:53] referring to this time of Abraham and
[1:14:55] lot he said but even thus shall it be in
[1:14:58] the day when the son of man is revealed
[1:15:01] now catch this what Jesus is speaking of
[1:15:04] as it was in the days of lot so shall it
[1:15:07] be in the days when the son of man is
[1:15:09] reveal you watch when the church world
[1:15:11] gets a hold of this scripture they the
[1:15:13] the the focus is on the the condition of
[1:15:16] of Sodom it's all when it's preached
[1:15:18] about you you watch preachers preach
[1:15:20] about it on on on on on YouTube a
[1:15:22] different different
[1:15:23] backgrounds but but but the the focus is
[1:15:26] on Sodom it's on the condition of Sodom
[1:15:28] and the condition of the world and how
[1:15:29] many knows that we're living in a Sodom
[1:15:31] condition hello somebody it's the the
[1:15:33] condition of the world but the focus is
[1:15:35] on they they ate and they drank and they
[1:15:37] bought and they sold and they build it
[1:15:39] and and after all Sodom we're certainly
[1:15:40] living in a sodomite condition but do
[1:15:42] you realize brother Mar that the great
[1:15:44] thing that happened in the days of lot
[1:15:46] it was not fire and brimstone in Sodom
[1:15:48] the great thing that happened in the
[1:15:50] days of lot it's not that they were
[1:15:51] building and drinking and eating and the
[1:15:53] great thing that happened in the days of
[1:15:55] not of lot it wasn't even lot it was
[1:15:58] Abraham here when Jesus said as it was
[1:16:00] in the days of lot here lies a secret in
[1:16:02] this story is that while all of this was
[1:16:05] going on Abraham was over by his T and
[1:16:08] the Bible says in the Lord was remaining
[1:16:10] with him and he was fellowshipping and
[1:16:12] having communion with the Lord God
[1:16:14] Elohim the very God Of Heaven the
[1:16:16] creator of Heaven and Earth and while
[1:16:18] judgment would come upon the very city
[1:16:20] of Sodom here he was with his Lord see
[1:16:23] there's the secret of of what's laying
[1:16:25] in that story says see notice what
[1:16:27] happened this great thing that happened
[1:16:29] before judgment even struck Elohim was
[1:16:31] standing at the tent of Abraham notice
[1:16:33] what can I can I just kind just take a
[1:16:35] minute and no notice what happened when
[1:16:37] he was standing there first what did he
[1:16:39] do he discerned the heart of Sarah he
[1:16:42] said your wife laughed why did Sarah
[1:16:43] laugh in the tent oh I didn't laugh well
[1:16:46] yes you laughed he knew he knew exactly
[1:16:48] what took place in her heart the second
[1:16:50] thing he did brother Mark is he turned
[1:16:52] to Abra Abraham and he said why would I
[1:16:54] keep secrets from Abraham cuz he's going
[1:16:57] to be he's going to be of a great nation
[1:16:59] he he's going to be the inheritor of the
[1:17:01] earth his seed why would I keep a secret
[1:17:03] from him so then he turns and he begins
[1:17:06] to reveal the secrets of the heart of
[1:17:09] God to a man named Abraham and then
[1:17:12] brother Mark he would tell him how
[1:17:13] judgment is about to strike he are you
[1:17:16] catching me somebody he says then he
[1:17:19] starts telling him how judgment is about
[1:17:20] to strike he tells him the condition of
[1:17:23] Sodom then he says I'm want to make sure
[1:17:24] that the angels are doing what they're
[1:17:26] supposed to do down there because
[1:17:28] judgment is on that land but you notice
[1:17:30] oh my notice how Abraham responds to it
[1:17:32] but the mark the Bible says Abraham says
[1:17:34] Lord but if there be 50 over there would
[1:17:36] you spare the city see what it was
[1:17:38] Abraham being a top of the Bride of
[1:17:40] Jesus Christ because we're the Seed of
[1:17:42] Abraham but Mark he immediately cried
[1:17:44] out for Mercy he said God have mercy on
[1:17:46] him if there's 50 would you spare them
[1:17:48] if there's 40 would you spare them if
[1:17:50] there's 30 would you spare if there's 20
[1:17:52] if there's 10 Lord would you spare the
[1:17:54] city it was the response is't that a
[1:17:56] perfect type of today it's a perfect
[1:17:58] type of the Bride of Jesus Christ under
[1:18:01] the ministry of the son of man watch
[1:18:03] this son of man Ministry Jesus said this
[1:18:05] is the way it shall be uh when the son
[1:18:07] of man is revealed the ministry of the
[1:18:09] son of man the first thing you saw was
[1:18:11] the discernment of somebody's heart here
[1:18:13] he would come and begin to discern the
[1:18:15] heart of the woman and discern the
[1:18:17] hearts of people but then he would
[1:18:19] reveal to the Seed of Abraham The Secret
[1:18:22] of God's heart
[1:18:23] the very thing that happened at the tent
[1:18:25] of Abraham is the same thing that we've
[1:18:27] experienced today reveal the secret of
[1:18:30] God's heart he as he you said well who
[1:18:32] is the who is the Seed of Abraham it's
[1:18:34] you and me this is what Paul said he
[1:18:37] said your HS according to the promise if
[1:18:39] you be Christ you are Abraham's seed and
[1:18:42] your HS according to the promise so just
[1:18:45] like it was in the days of lot there was
[1:18:46] a lot there was a Sodom there was
[1:18:49] wickedness there was a wicked City but
[1:18:51] then there was also an Abraham today
[1:18:53] there's still Sodom there's still a
[1:18:55] condition of Sodom but there's the Seed
[1:18:56] of Abraham and the son of man that stood
[1:18:58] there before Abraham and begin to reveal
[1:19:00] the secrets of the heart of God is the
[1:19:02] same son of man that came today and
[1:19:04] revealed the very secrets of God's heart
[1:19:06] to the Bride of Jesus Christ that's why
[1:19:10] think about it that's why he would come
[1:19:12] and have communion with us brother Mark
[1:19:13] that's why this this gift of Elohim that
[1:19:15] would operate under the ministry of the
[1:19:17] son of man brother Wesley this gift of
[1:19:19] elem would preach the messages of future
[1:19:22] home and the revelation of the Seven
[1:19:24] Seals and the Rapture message you say
[1:19:26] what was he doing he was revealing the
[1:19:28] secrets of the hearts of God you think
[1:19:30] about the world how they would talk
[1:19:32] about it this whole church world my my
[1:19:34] wife was raised up in a in a in a church
[1:19:35] of Christ mixed up Baptist background
[1:19:37] and and and you know the the way that
[1:19:39] they believed Heaven it was just you
[1:19:41] know she used to tell me how the how the
[1:19:42] the ways they believed things and how
[1:19:44] people's going to be angels and we're
[1:19:45] going to get wings and we're and we're
[1:19:46] going to float off in some Cloud
[1:19:47] somewhere but here when the son of man
[1:19:49] Ministry would come he would take that
[1:19:51] very thing that mindset of people that
[1:19:53] they they couldn't even find in the word
[1:19:55] and reveal the heart of God and say but
[1:19:57] that's not the way it's going to be
[1:19:58] we're not going to be floating on some
[1:20:00] Cloud somewhere where you where you
[1:20:02] float through one another he said but
[1:20:03] you'll be in this same this this the the
[1:20:05] the way that God Made You you were made
[1:20:07] in that very image you'll be an 18 or 20
[1:20:10] year old boy in the very Prime of your
[1:20:12] life that's the theophany body that God
[1:20:14] has given you and you'll walk up to your
[1:20:16] brother and you'll be able to shake his
[1:20:17] hand and you'll have a place to have to
[1:20:19] dwell in and have communion with it'll
[1:20:22] be an eternal day and there'll never be
[1:20:23] a n there won't be a devil to be able to
[1:20:26] torment
[1:20:27] you that ain't the way it's going to be
[1:20:29] they talk about judgment and how that
[1:20:31] you're all going to go through judgment
[1:20:32] have everybody scared to death you're
[1:20:34] going to go through this this great
[1:20:35] judgment and Friends some people ought
[1:20:36] to be scared but to the Bride of Jesus
[1:20:38] Christ he said but that ain't the way
[1:20:39] it's going to be you ain't going to be
[1:20:41] judged over there you're judged over
[1:20:43] here by believing the word of
[1:20:46] God that's our judgment that's the
[1:20:48] Judgment that God gives you would you
[1:20:49] accept the very message that God has
[1:20:51] sent in the end time the ministry of the
[1:20:53] son of man see it would show the way
[1:20:55] it's going to be he said listen as it
[1:20:56] was in the days of lot so shall it be at
[1:20:59] the time when the son of man is revealed
[1:21:02] watch the son of man was revealed to
[1:21:04] Abraham's group as a man he was a
[1:21:06] prophet in the form of human flesh an
[1:21:08] ordinary man with dust on his clothes
[1:21:11] and Abraham called him
[1:21:13] Elohim he came to him as a man but he
[1:21:16] said Elohim say See Jesus promises in
[1:21:19] the last days the son of man will be
[1:21:20] revealed again the same type to the same
[1:21:22] type of group The Royal Seed of Abraham
[1:21:25] just before the fire falls but remember
[1:21:27] the church never received any more
[1:21:29] witness listen to this Abraham and them
[1:21:31] didn't the promised son they were
[1:21:33] looking for was brought right after that
[1:21:35] here they were waiting on this son to be
[1:21:37] born so the Lord would come and he would
[1:21:40] spend time with him he would promise
[1:21:41] that you're going to see your promised
[1:21:43] son he destroyed here come the Judgment
[1:21:45] it destroyed the city then the very next
[1:21:47] thing that they saw was the the the
[1:21:49] promised son he says see that's way the
[1:21:51] way it is today the the church is
[1:21:53] looking for the promised son amen we're
[1:21:55] looking for the promised son which is
[1:21:56] Jesus he'll come right after the days of
[1:21:59] this ministry of the son of man he'll be
[1:22:01] revealed from the heavens he said see
[1:22:04] it's too plain it's got to be that way
[1:22:06] don't you see where we are there didn't
[1:22:08] come said there ain't coming another
[1:22:09] witness after the ministry of the son of
[1:22:11] man it's the last witness that the Earth
[1:22:13] will ever see but after this son of man
[1:22:15] Ministry then would follow you would see
[1:22:18] the very promised son you see so that's
[1:22:20] where that's where we are brother Mark
[1:22:21] immediately after you my friends that
[1:22:23] ought to wake everybody up when the son
[1:22:25] of man Ministry was gone the very next
[1:22:27] thing was to see the promised son don't
[1:22:29] you realize it we're living in that day
[1:22:31] we're we we may not get through this
[1:22:33] service we may not go through another
[1:22:34] day tomorrow we're living in the age of
[1:22:37] the promised son said don't you see
[1:22:40] where we are here the world is in a
[1:22:42] Sodom condition here we are the seat of
[1:22:44] Abraham we're looking for the promise
[1:22:46] son we've heard the ministry of the son
[1:22:48] of man the only thing left is fire and
[1:22:51] brimstone think about it but notice as
[1:22:54] Moses brother Mark he continues I got
[1:22:56] just a few more minutes I got glory to
[1:23:00] God Moses continues with this
[1:23:03] inspiration of Elohim and as he writes
[1:23:07] of Elohim you'll find as he goes through
[1:23:09] the scripture he begins to take I think
[1:23:11] this is so good he starts to take the
[1:23:14] very attributes of God and he would add
[1:23:16] the name of God with his attributes and
[1:23:19] so when you'd continue to read through
[1:23:21] the words of Moses he'd go down into
[1:23:23] Genesis the 14th chapter whenever MDC
[1:23:26] would come he'd say MDC he would call
[1:23:29] him L Elon L being Elohim Elon in other
[1:23:34] words he was the priest of the most high
[1:23:36] God what did they call Jesus the high
[1:23:39] priest that can be touched by the
[1:23:41] feeling of our infirmities Genesis the
[1:23:43] 21st chapter he calls he calls him LM o
[1:23:47] l a m which was an everlasting God this
[1:23:51] came after after Abraham had dug the
[1:23:53] well at beerseba brother Mark remember
[1:23:55] the well the very the place that that
[1:23:57] that Hagar and and and Ishmael was out
[1:24:00] that day and they' ran out of water and
[1:24:01] they had they had nothing to drink and
[1:24:03] so the they begin to cry out unto the
[1:24:04] Lord they drank the last bit of water
[1:24:06] that they had and they cried to the Lord
[1:24:07] and the Bible says but the Lord heard
[1:24:09] the Cry of the lad and he came down to
[1:24:11] Hagar and he opened her eyes and in the
[1:24:13] middle of a Wilderness in the middle of
[1:24:14] a desert he opened up a well to her that
[1:24:16] she could have water he said see what
[1:24:18] was it it was the same Jesus Christ and
[1:24:20] when he stood in the temple that day he
[1:24:22] said If any man thirst let him come unto
[1:24:24] me and drink here when they were lost
[1:24:26] here when they were in a Wilderness here
[1:24:28] when they were thirsting for Life Jesus
[1:24:29] would stand by right beside him brother
[1:24:31] Mark and he would open their eyes he
[1:24:32] would call them out by name and said if
[1:24:34] a man is thirsty I'm The Well of life he
[1:24:37] was The Well of BBA as it was to Hagar
[1:24:40] and this place of beerseba it was called
[1:24:42] the Bible said upon it was called the
[1:24:44] name of the Lord Elam an everlasting God
[1:24:48] oh my a't that something he was an
[1:24:49] everlasting God brother Joe you know

[1:24:53] a constant God he he's a God that
[1:24:55] outlasts our trials he's a God that
[1:24:57] outlasts our problem he whenever you
[1:24:59] feel like you can't last another day but
[1:25:01] our God is an everlasting God when you
[1:25:03] feel like giving up and quitting and
[1:25:05] throwing in the towel but our God is an
[1:25:07] everlasting God he'll out Outlast every
[1:25:09] backsliding condition that we go through
[1:25:11] he'll Outlast all of our unbelief he'll
[1:25:13] Outlast all of our criticism and he'll
[1:25:15] still be there why he's an everlasting
[1:25:17] God you may turn your back on him but
[1:25:20] he'll Outlast it you may run from him
[1:25:22] but he'll Outlast you you say Lord I'm
[1:25:24] going to run from the presence of God
[1:25:25] but you'll never run too far that God

[1:25:29] Outlast he don't matter how far you go
[1:25:31] he'll Outlast you cuz he's an
[1:25:33] everlasting God the Bible says surely

[1:26:05] Everlasting he's lolm an everlasting God
[1:26:09] he he would go the mark he would follow
[1:26:11] after us think about it when he pursues
[1:26:13] you I love this people look at God the
[1:26:16] wrong way when God pursues after you
[1:26:18] he's not pursuing after you to kill and
[1:26:21] to steal and destroy that's what the
[1:26:22] devil does he said but when he pursues
[1:26:25] after you he pursues after you to give
[1:26:26] you life ain't that something to see God
[1:26:29] pursuing after you saying but I've got
[1:26:31] life for you I don't I don't know about
[1:26:33] this God but I've got life for you I I
[1:26:35] don't know if I can live this kind but I
[1:26:36] got life for you I I think I'm just
[1:26:38] going to give up but I've got life for
[1:26:39] you I don't think I can make it another
[1:26:41] day but I've got life for you God
[1:26:43] pursuing after you to give you eternal
[1:26:45] life that's what kind of God we serve
[1:26:48] he's an everlasting God he outlasts all
[1:26:50] our doubt and all of our fears he's
[1:26:53] coming that even maybe sometimes he will
[1:26:56] find us he'll find us in our weakest
[1:26:58] State that's where God founds most of us
[1:27:01] in our weakest State when there ain't
[1:27:03] nowhere else to turn to but that
[1:27:06] everlasting God walks into the
[1:27:08] room Jared you said what do you do in
[1:27:10] your weakest day he allows you to draw
[1:27:14] strength you said well where can I draw
[1:27:16] strength from well let Moses tell you he
[1:27:18] said Abram was 99 years old when the
[1:27:20] Lord appeared to him and he he said I am
[1:27:22] almighty God El
[1:27:25] Shad I'm An Almighty God walk before me
[1:27:29] and be thou perfect the very name of God
[1:27:32] elshad say see what it meant he said the
[1:27:35] because Shad he said it was speaking of
[1:27:37] the of a breast just like a a mother
[1:27:40] would feed her child yes he said I am
[1:27:42] elhad the the the breasted God the place
[1:27:46] to be able to draw strength that he
[1:27:48] would be able to nurse here as we come
[1:27:50] to the Lord and as children that it
[1:27:52] would be the place to be able to draw
[1:27:53] strength so here God even in your
[1:27:55] weakest condition brother M he would
[1:27:57] give you a place to be able to nurse you
[1:27:58] to strength you see most people they
[1:28:00] come well I can't walk well no you can't
[1:28:02] walk but you'll be able to nurse I I I'm
[1:28:05] so sick I can't go another day but God
[1:28:06] give us something to nurse from to be
[1:28:08] able to to nurse our strength back
[1:28:10] brother Mark our healing that we could
[1:28:12] we can nurse our healing our Salvation
[1:28:15] God has given us a place to draw every
[1:28:17] promise that God gave us that we got a
[1:28:19] place to draw the promise of God from on
[1:28:22] think about it when God gives you a word
[1:28:24] you may you may you may come up for
[1:28:26] healing and you go back and you're
[1:28:27] sicker than you was the first day but
[1:28:29] keep drawing from the promise you may
[1:28:31] not you may go back and you say well I
[1:28:32] don't guess I got healed I feel the same
[1:28:34] way I did yesterday I feel worse than I
[1:28:35] did yesterday they keep drawing from the
[1:28:37] promise he said see notice if you'll
[1:28:38] keep drawing from it your strength will
[1:28:40] begin to renew your the arms straighten
[1:28:42] up the the eyes begin to brighten up the
[1:28:45] the heart begins to beat normal why
[1:28:47] because we're drawing from a breasted
[1:28:49] God the god that has the ability to give
[1:28:51] you strength it was God's promise that
[1:28:53] he gave to the Seed of Abraham brother
[1:28:55] Mark and we are the children of Abraham
[1:28:57] and we got a right to draw from the
[1:28:58] promise of God that's thus sayth the
[1:29:00] Lord we got to write the draw from the
[1:29:02] promise of God cuz you're the Seed of
[1:29:04] Abraham it don't matter how you feel I
[1:29:07] want somebody say it this morning I'm
[1:29:08] still drawing you may feel like giving
[1:29:10] up but say I'm still drawing I may be
[1:29:12] sick in my body I'm still drawing I may
[1:29:15] feel like I can't go another day I'm
[1:29:16] still drawing why because God has given
[1:29:19] me a place to draw from so we stagger
[1:29:21] not at the promise of God but we draw
[1:29:23] strength we build we by faith brother
[1:29:25] Mark we draw we give glory to God and we
[1:29:27] still
[1:29:29] draw said he's the same elhad ey tonight
[1:29:32] he changes not his Covenant people have
[1:29:35] the same privilege to draw from that
[1:29:36] same resource that Abraham had to draw
[1:29:38] from CU he swore by the same Covenant
[1:29:40] that he would give us the promise Lord
[1:29:43] you said well how do you draw from him
[1:29:45] let me tell you said he's El shadia he's
[1:29:48] still the rested God in the New
[1:29:51] Testament and the the Old Testament yes
[1:29:53] to see so if you want to draw from God
[1:29:55] draw your strength from it everything
[1:29:57] you have need of see that's the only way
[1:29:59] a Believer can get his strength is to
[1:30:02] pull it from the word of God that's
[1:30:04] where our strength comes from you won't
[1:30:06] you won't get it from a seminary
[1:30:07] somewhere you're not going to get it
[1:30:09] from from some Feelgood message or
[1:30:11] something but the only way that you'll
[1:30:12] ever get strength is to pull it from the
[1:30:14] word of God that's the very strength of
[1:30:16] God brother Mah that he promised to the
[1:30:18] Believers and if you want strength pull
[1:30:21] it from the word
[1:30:22] We Stand by it we believe it brother
[1:30:24] Mark we pull from the word of God we
[1:30:27] have knees this morning you say how do I
[1:30:29] get my knees met pull it from the word
[1:30:30] of God when a man of God would come to
[1:30:32] preach the word don't you realize had
[1:30:34] somebody told me the other day he said
[1:30:36] every word you preach it feels like you
[1:30:37] just somebody had told him that you just
[1:30:39] just feels like you just talk right to
[1:30:41] me and then another sister told me same
[1:30:43] thing another brother told me the same
[1:30:44] thing I said isn't it something that
[1:30:46] every time you come to a house of God
[1:30:47] how many people ever feel that way I
[1:30:49] feel like you're just speaking to me is
[1:30:50] it something that you can set there and
[1:30:52] talk to 40 different or or 150 different
[1:30:54] people and they all have different
[1:30:55] problems and different things that
[1:30:56] they're facing and you can speak to
[1:30:58] every one of them because it isn't a man
[1:31:00] it's the very word of God and when the
[1:31:02] word of God is preached the word of God
[1:31:04] finds the places that people have need
[1:31:05] of the Bible says the word of God is a
[1:31:08] discerner of the thoughts and the
[1:31:09] intents of your heart it it finds our
[1:31:11] weaknesses it finds what the places that
[1:31:14] we need correction and you feel like why
[1:31:16] are they just why I feel like he just
[1:31:18] talking to me but it ain't the men that
[1:31:20] are preaching it's the word of God
[1:31:21] that's being preached see he knows what
[1:31:24] we have need of but Mark we draw from it
[1:31:26] say well what I need pull it out of the
[1:31:28] word you come to the house of God you
[1:31:30] pull you can you you never seen God move
[1:31:32] until you see a people pull you can see
[1:31:34] the greatest gift of Prophecy you ever
[1:31:36] saw and it would never be operated
[1:31:38] without a people that would pull from a
[1:31:40] gift of God but when a people pull God
[1:31:42] speaks he deals with your heart you have
[1:31:44] needs from God friends don't you wor
[1:31:46] don't you can't just come to the house
[1:31:47] of God say well I'm going to sit here
[1:31:48] and let God fix all my problems pull
[1:31:50] from the word I'm I'm let God he's going
[1:31:52] to fix my marriage trouble pull from the
[1:31:54] word I'm going to let God fix my
[1:31:55] finances pull from the word I'm going to
[1:31:57] let God fix my sickness pull from the
[1:31:59] word of God what you have need of we'll
[1:32:02] draw it right out of the word is that
[1:32:04] what the Bible says faith cometh by
[1:32:06] hearing the word see we pull it from the
[1:32:09] word it builds our faith the faith to be
[1:32:10] able to receive the very promises that
[1:32:12] God gave to him that's the
[1:32:15] Bible amen watch what Moses I'm going to
[1:32:18] close as Moses would write but Mark he
[1:32:22] would sit there and he would start to
[1:32:23] write about the things of God and what
[1:32:25] belonged to God yes I love this part
[1:32:28] because when he would write about
[1:32:30] Abraham and then Abraham and and Isaac
[1:32:33] and then here Isaac would have Jacob and
[1:32:35] Esau he would write the story as you
[1:32:37] would read about the story of Jacob and
[1:32:39] you notice how that this Hebrew name L
[1:32:43] that was that was Elohim yeah it was
[1:32:45] used in many names to express that they
[1:32:47] were the children of God you watch how
[1:32:50] Jacob whenever Jacob would come come out
[1:32:52] here Jacob was was a man the Bible the
[1:32:54] name Jacob meant supplanter he was a in
[1:32:57] other words he was he was a a man he
[1:33:00] that that would supplanter means to
[1:33:02] supersede by another Force remember he
[1:33:04] stole the birthright so here he would
[1:33:06] many would say he was a Sher he was a he
[1:33:08] was a deceiver it was it means treachery
[1:33:11] he his name meant all sorts of of of not
[1:33:14] good things but Jacob for the mark but
[1:33:17] he come one day in
[1:33:20] contact with a man name
[1:33:22] Elohim and when he came in contact with
[1:33:25] you the Bible says he wrestled with him
[1:33:28] here Jacob as he wrestled with the Lord
[1:33:31] and he was trying to to get what he
[1:33:33] needed from God oh brother Travis he was
[1:33:36] he was pulling and he was drawing all
[1:33:38] night the Bible says he wrestled with
[1:33:39] the Lord and as he left the presence of
[1:33:42] the Lord that God touched him and he he
[1:33:44] made a mark in his thigh remember or in
[1:33:46] his hip and he he made a Mark that he
[1:33:48] would that it would affect him all the
[1:33:49] days of his life but notice what God did
[1:33:51] I thought it was so good is that God he
[1:33:53] said no longer will I call you Jacob but
[1:33:57] now I'm going to call you isra L God
[1:34:01] took a man and he put his name in his
[1:34:04] isn't it something the name Israel it
[1:34:07] don't it it means Elohim perseveres here
[1:34:11] was a man Jacob that that wrestled with
[1:34:13] the Lord all night and then God would
[1:34:15] put his name on him he said Elohim the
[1:34:17] very nation of Israel was named after
[1:34:19] God the same Elohim that Moses wrote
[1:34:21] about the very nation was named after
[1:34:23] him my brother Mark he say see God put
[1:34:25] his name on I don't know about y'all
[1:34:26] that about makes me want to shout out
[1:34:27] over this building that think that he
[1:34:29] would that God would put his name on him
[1:34:31] and don't you realize that because he
[1:34:33] had the name of God on him that's what
[1:34:35] the brought the blessing upon his life
[1:34:37] see because where the name of God is
[1:34:39] then the blessing of God is you can read
[1:34:41] that in numbers the 6th chapter he said
[1:34:43] see the Lord spake unto Moses saying
[1:34:45] Speak to Aaron and his sons saying on
[1:34:48] this wise shall you bless the children
[1:34:50] of Israel say the Lord has blessed thee
[1:34:53] and kept Thee the Lord makes his face to
[1:34:55] shine upon you and be gracious unto you
[1:34:57] the Lord will lift his countenance upon
[1:34:59] thee and give thee peace and they shall
[1:35:02] put my name upon the children of Israel
[1:35:04] and I will bless them so the very place
[1:35:07] where the name of God is is where the
[1:35:09] blessing of God is oh friends don't you
[1:35:11] realize that God would name them and
[1:35:13] then he would bring the blessing upon
[1:35:14] them the very blessing that was in the
[1:35:16] name of God I know this may be boring to
[1:35:17] some of you but the blessing that was in
[1:35:19] the name won't you stand to your feet
[1:35:20] this morning the name that was in him he
[1:35:23] gave to he gave to him so the blessing
[1:35:25] of God could be on him now watch this
[1:35:27] name he didn't stop there watch the
[1:35:29] prophets of God that would come the
[1:35:30] first the the major prophet come by the
[1:35:32] name of Elijah Elijah it was the very
[1:35:35] name of God that was put in Elijah's
[1:35:37] name the next one was Elisha Elisha the
[1:35:40] name of God was put in Elisha's name
[1:35:42] matter of fact if you read Elijah Elijah
[1:35:44] means Elohim is Lord Elisha means
[1:35:49] Elohim Elisha means Elohim is my
[1:35:52] salvation so here the prophets of God
[1:35:55] would have the very name of God it's no
[1:35:57] wonder that Elijah stopped the rain the
[1:36:01] blessing of God was on his life it's no
[1:36:03] wonder that that he raised a dead boy to
[1:36:06] life because God's name was on him it's
[1:36:08] no wonder brother Mar that he parted the
[1:36:10] Waters of the Jordan cuz God's name was
[1:36:12] on him it's no wonder that that he that
[1:36:15] he multiplied the oil because God's name
[1:36:17] was on him and then it's no wonder that
[1:36:21] he ascended into heaven cuz God's name
[1:36:23] was on him but notice what happened a
[1:36:26] double portion of what Elijah had fell
[1:36:28] back on who on Elisha the very same name
[1:36:33] that was named on Elijah was named on
[1:36:35] Elisha it was the same God that was the
[1:36:37] god of Elijah was the god of Elijah and
[1:36:40] brother said see he got a double portion
[1:36:42] and the same Miracles that was done in
[1:36:44] Elijah was done in Elisha he said and
[1:36:46] Elijah was a type of Christ and Elisha
[1:36:50] was a type of the church Church oh
[1:36:52] friends don't you realize that's the
[1:36:53] same thing that God done for us the very
[1:36:56] think of it the name of God that was on
[1:36:58] him was on her that's what happened when
[1:37:01] Jesus if Elijah was the type of Christ
[1:37:04] what happened when Jesus resurrected he
[1:37:06] ascended what did Elijah do he ascended
[1:37:09] Jesus he ascended but notice after his
[1:37:11] resurrection when he ascended the Bible
[1:37:13] says when they went into the upper room
[1:37:15] that day 120 and they were in one mind
[1:37:17] and one Accord then all of a sudden
[1:37:19] little licks of fire fell on all of them
[1:37:21] what was it it was the same spirit of
[1:37:23] God that that was that was in the man
[1:37:25] Jesus Christ Elohim that same Elohim the
[1:37:29] life of God fell upon the Believers and
[1:37:34] they were filled with the same spirit
[1:37:36] that Jesus had when he was walking on
[1:37:37] the earth just like Elisha had a double
[1:37:40] portion of what Elijah had now this
[1:37:42] church the Bride of Jesus Christ brother
[1:37:44] Wesley she's got the double portion of
[1:37:46] what he had he said see whenever he went
[1:37:49] on Easter Sunday he sent the holy SP
[1:37:51] Spirit back upon the church with a
[1:37:52] double portion of it that we might do
[1:37:54] the same things that he did for the
[1:37:56] Bible said these signs shall follow them
[1:37:58] that believe friends don't you realize
[1:38:00] you can put whatever name on the door if
[1:38:02] you want to the nominations they'll put
[1:38:04] the name you can put the name of Christ
[1:38:05] on the door this is the this is Christ
[1:38:07] Church this is the Church of Christ this
[1:38:09] all these things you can do that all you
[1:38:10] want to you can make a religion and you
[1:38:13] can call it God you can put God on your
[1:38:15] shirt you can put God on your Facebook
[1:38:17] page you can you can put the name of God
[1:38:19] anywhere but it'll never do you no good
[1:38:21] good said see Christ's name on the
[1:38:23] building they can call it what they want
[1:38:25] but it doesn't make it so just because
[1:38:27] you put it there he said but when God
[1:38:29] puts his name in something that's what
[1:38:31] does it see God put his name in Elijah
[1:38:34] God put his name in Jacob God put his
