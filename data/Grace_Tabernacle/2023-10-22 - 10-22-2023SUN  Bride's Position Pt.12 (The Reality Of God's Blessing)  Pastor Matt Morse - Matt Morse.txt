Lord I think that's the way it ought to be Lord we're just glad to be able to serve you and Lord I know that that there's many needs that are among us today and Lord I pray Lord that you would meet every need Lord you would heal those that are sick and need a touch in their body and Lord we come today Lord to break the word of God God and Lord we ask you Lord that you would take this word and anoint it and speak it to our hearts Lord that we would be lifted in the word of God and Lord that the church would be edified this morning Lord I pray you'd move me out of the way Lord that you would just come and speak your will in the name of Jesus Christ we pray and the church says amen amen we just want to invite you to the scripture and I know we've got a little bit of a late start but I'll be uh conscious of it we just want to read out of the book of Ephesians in the first chapter and we're going to read from the first verse and uh when you get there just say amen and we'll just uh been speaking on the bride's position and uh before the meetings and and uh this morning I want to take one more uh step in that direction on the bride's position now how many are familiar with that term the bride I know that that those that are a local assembly but maybe some visitors or uh that may be not familiar as much but that is the term that is used uh to describe the true church in the end times time it's those that as a body of Believers we collectively the Bride of Jesus Christ in other words it was the church that God has accepted and put his name on and and Christ came to be the head over the church and so uh we you find that all through the scripture and uh but uh as as individuals you're Sons and Daughters of God but as a body we're the bride of Christ and so we're the church that God chose and I'm I'm proud to be a part of that and there's many this Bride is a many membered bride all over the world and there's there's there's a there's a people that are gathering today that are a part of the Bride of Jesus Christ and I'm just proud to be numbered by as one of them amen so I want to read this out of Ephesians the first chapter the first verse Paul says I an apostle of Jesus Christ by the will of God to the Saints which are at Ephesus and to the faithful in Christ Jesus Grace be to you and peace from God our Father and from the Lord Jesus Christ blessed be the God and father of our Lord Jesus Christ who hath blessed us with all spiritual blessings in Heavenly places in Christ according as he hath chosen Us in him before the foundation of the world that we should be holy and Without Blame before him in love having predestinated us unto the adoption of children by Jesus Christ to himself according to the good pleasure of his will to the praise of the glory of his grace wherein he hath made us accepted in the Beloved and we'll just ask the Lord to add His blessings to the reading of the word this morning now I'm not going to hold you very long I know we're starting late so we'll just get in here and have church for a little bit and and uh we just want to allow the Lord to have the Liberty to to speak to us and bring us further along in our walk with God how many say Amen to that that's the desire of the Believers and I want to speak this morning as we're on this subject of the bride's position I want to use this as a subtitle the reality of God's blessing the reality of God's blessing last time whenever we spoke we had went into 2 Corinthians Ians in the 7th chapter and and Apostle Paul was speaking of he said as we have these promises remember we went through the promises of God how many was here for that and we went through the promise some I know there was more than that how many was here for that remember we went through the promises about three weeks ago on a Sunday morning and it was about the same time 11:30 11:45 and but we went through the promises of God that that that were given to the bride in the end time and then uh and then the last service that we spoke what Paul said having these promises he said let us cleanse ourselves and so we went in the message of of of of a perfect Holiness and in that message I ended it in the in recognizing your day in its message we actually ended it with this quote and uh uh and and in this message brother Bram was preaching recognizing your day uh showing where the bride is today or the position of the Bride spiritually speaking and showing where she is uh in in regards to the condition of the world and the age that we live in and and and and and the world has come to their place and the bride must come to her place and so uh we've seen this is how that things are happening around the world and I know there's many things that the world don't have an answer to but I thank God this morning that we don't just have to wonder what's going on and have to come to church scared and not know what tomorrow holds but we know we we may not know everything's going to happen tomorrow but we sure know who holds tomorrow and we know he's got it in control brother Mark and so we come uh today with confidence in the word of God knowing who we are and knowing where we are in the age that we live in and uh the things they don't have the answer to I believe that God has given us the answer uh in the end time and we see the world as it's getting into position you look at the chaos and the wars and the failures and all this crazy things that's going on in the world today and you see it's just the world that's getting in a position for the rapturing of the church but friends if the world is getting in position for the rapturing of the church well then the church has to get in position for the rapturing of the church and I thank God that there's a little bride somewhere that's getting in that same place she's not she's not wrapped up in the world and caught up in everything that's going on but she's caught up in the word of God preparing her heart for for the rapturing of the Bride of Jesus Christ and in this message we read this as as we were closing brother R says see it's what the world they can't accept what's being done now they're going out crying there's going to be a Breaking of the day there's a great thing that's going to happen pray pray pray we're not too late yet isn't that the way the world is it's just a constant chaos everybody get together and pray something's going to happen there's got to be a Great Awakening there's got to be a great move of God he said they're crying and believing there's going to be something they're good people he said but why are they doing it what what have they done is they've not recognized The Awakening of the Bride of Jesus Christ said see by being a Christian they feel the pull of the hour but they haven't recognized what's already been done and it's making them feel that way they know something is supposed to happen they know something is happening something is going on in this world but they're looking for it way off in the future but to come but they don't realize that it's already happened right by you my isn't that the way way it's always been whenever Jesus came to the Earth that's the same thing that happened in the old days they were waiting for the coming of a messiah they were waiting on a forerunner to come and and forerun the the first coming of Christ they believed that he would come but whenever they came they cut the head off the Forerunner and hung the Messiah on a cross said see why did they do it because they didn't recognize the day they were living in they they didn't recognize that this wasn't something for the future any longer but they were living in that age and I thank God that there's a people today that recognize that we're living in the age of the rapturing of the Bride of Jesus Christ it ain't just some story anymore it ain't just some Bible story or something that we're looking for in the the future but brother Mark we recognize it in the age that we're living in so see why did they not see it brother Joe because they were blind they were they were blinded and you said well what causes blindness what caused them to not be able to see the age that they were living in brother Bram said it was because it was prophesied that they would be blinded how many remember Isaiah in the sixth chapter he goes and and he begins to speak of the way it would be in the end time he said I will tell the people they would hear ye indeed but not understand and see but not perceive he said for the he said see their eyes would be shut L they they would see with their eyes their ears would be shut unless they would hear with their ears and be converted and understand with their heart so Isaiah makes this prophecy that this is the condition that people would be in in in in in in Matthew the 13th chapter when Jesus begins to preach in his Earthly Ministry he speaking in Parables remember every everything that he talked in front of the in front of the uh the the the public it was speaking in Parables and the disciples came to him and they said Lord why do you speak in Parables the people there why don't you just speak plainly and tell them where we are and who you are and why this is why why can't you just make it plain why why do you speak in Parables and Jesus answers this question in this way he says I speak to them in Parables because in seeing they see not in hearing they hear not neither do they understand he said for in them it is fulfilled the prophecy of Isaiah which saith by hearing you shall hear and you shall not understand seeing you shall see and shall not perceive for the people's heart is waxed gross their ears are dull of hearing and their eyes they have closed lest at any time they should should see with their eyes and hear with their ears and should understand with their heart and should be converted and I should heal them hear or heal them and so here you notice as G I'm just laying a foundation as as Jesus is speaking of this he shows that he speaks in Parables because there are those that were not meant to hear isn't it something that he would speak this way he spoke in a way that only the Believers would catch what he was saying he said it isn't meant for them to hear it it didn't meant for them to see it it was prophesied that they couldn't see it it was prophesied that their ears would be closed they wouldn't hear it in other words not everybody that heard Jesus preach believe what he said not everybody that went to the meetings they believed it when they left the meetings not everybody that went to The Sermon on the Mount came down from the sermon and was a disciple of Jesus Christ not everybody except when they saw the Miracles became a follower of him and friends it's the same thing it is today not everybody comes to church and leaves out the Bride of Jesus Christ not everybody comes to the house of God and leaves out worshiping God and being a Christian and cleaning up their life preach brother Matt I thank you I believe I might I I don't think everybody that comes and sits on a church pew can call themsel a Christian they may be a good church member but see that it takes something reality a people that has an ear to hear and an eye to see that's what makes them a real believer and a Christian and a real follower of Jesus Christ Proverbs the 20th chapter the Bible says the hearing ear and the Seeing Eye the Lord has made both of them so the ear that can hear the Lord made the eye that can see the Lord made many are looking to hear they're looking to see and here Jesus would tell us it wasn't for them to see it wasn't for them to hear it was God that had closed their eyes and they closed their ears to understanding friend don't you realize there's nothing that Jesus could have done that would have ever made them be a believer I know that's the way people think today well you know there's some that that are out there that don't that they aren't Believers and they they're not Christians and ma can you go brother Matt can you preach to him can you talk to this one just another time can you preach him another word can you say one more thing friends don't you realize there's people in this world today and I know it's hard to swallow but there's people in this world today it don't matter how much preaching they hear they'll never be a believer it don't matter how much Supernatural they see they'll never be a disciple of Jesus Christ it don't matter how many miracles it doesn't matter how much time that you would spend explaining it to them brother Mark they'll never accept it they'll never follow it they'll never be a Christian they'll never be a believer they'll never come and sit on a a church pew and worship God and back the word of God they'll never do it because it ain't in them to do it friends if I felt that way in any way I'd run to God I wouldn't walk to God I'd run to God if I felt like I hear preaching and it ain't doing nothing to me and I hear the word being spoke and something ain't changing on the inside of me I'd lay down everything I have and I'd run to almighty God God don't let me be one that would live in this age and have ears that can't hear and eyes that can't see but I thank God that wasn't the end of it see that wasn't the only class of people that was in the world here Jesus was answering this question brother Wesley and and as he answered it he said see they have eyes and ears but they can't see and hear but Jesus said but blessed are your ears for they hear and blessed are your eyes for they see by isn't it wonderful blessed are your ears for they hear and blessed are your eyes for they see blessed are you that you can receive a revelation of the word of God my is that a wonderful message blessed are you brother Bobby that that you're a Believer blessed are you that you can say Amen to the word of God blessed are you that there's something on the inside of you that when you hear the truth being spoken something Rises up and say Lord let me live that with all my heart blessed are you for you have ears to hear and eyes to see see these are those that were blessed of God I know many times we think about blessings and we we use a very carnal thinking to think about blessings and cursings see there but all through the scripture we'll find you'll find that there's this is the way we think as long as good things are happening to us we then I'm living under the blessing of God but then when bad things happen I must be living under a curse see there's a that's the problem with preaching that I know there there's many that has preached that something happens in your life well youve done something wrong and it's the curse of God on your life or or you know and but then whenever something happens to them they they don't want to remember that no more so see that's why you don't say that kind of stuff because it ain't got nothing to do with it well God's blessing me today and he's cursing me tomorrow and and all all these things that people say you see but the blessings of God and and there are blessings of God God does bless his children but the blessings of God are not the same as a person that is blessed of God there's a big difference in blessings and being blessed I've preached a series on that one time but see the blessings of God comes in many ways and it comes to many people think of just blessings any better just think of the blessings of God isn't it wonderful to think about I know we don't preach about it a lot because people they they they get all weird about you when you just talk you talking about God blessing people but but but God does bless his children Jesus said he made maketh his son to rise on the evil and on the good and he sendeth rain on the just and on the unjust see he gives and he takes you think about how how God is and see brother Bram says see sometimes we get to a place we think God blesses us he gave me a Cadillac he gave me a better job he gave me this he said there's no sign that he can't turn his Blessing from you God does bless you he said see when you get lifted up and you say well I once laid all night and I prayed and and I once I once went to church and I once served God and I once spent time and dedicated he said I once done I once done this and that but I don't do it anymore he said then you're on Dangerous Ground it don't matter how much God has blessed you brother Mar if you ever get to a place where I don't have to pray no more you're on Dangerous Ground well God's been blessing me and and and my he just poured His blessings out on me I don't have to do nothing no more you're on Dangerous Ground I don't have to get to church early and get ready and prepare for service you're on Dangerous Ground I don't I don't have to have a a prayer meeting anymore for my children God's going to take care of them cuz he said they belong to me you're on Dangerous Ground when you get to a place where you don't pray and you don't worship God and you can't do the things of God and you can't go to church and you can't and you can't you can't say Amen you can't lift your hand no more I don't have to do that no more because after all I'm blessed of God he said you're on Dangerous Ground that's the spirit of Le oosa brother Mark the Bible said they'd be rich and increased with goods and have need of nothing they're on Dangerous Ground they don't need nothing anymore we don't need God anymore after all God has given me many blessings they've heard so much of it they don't need it they've heard so much word preached we don't need any word preached anymore I've been to church my whole life I don't have to go anymore because I've heard all of it I need to hear I'll just go whenever my favorite people are there and then I'll come and hang out with everybody else you're on Dangerous Ground the word came this is what people think that God gives us Commandments and he gave us the Bible to rule over you it's the way to rule over you or God to hold you down or keep you in line but do you realize that God actually gave his word for for a a way to bless his children that's why he give his word that's why he give the Commandments have you ever thought of it that way that he gave it to bring a blessing to your life brother Mark this may be hard for y'all to to hear talking about the blessings might ought but a smile on every face this is what the Bible said blessed is the man that fearth the Lord that delighteth greatly in his Commandments he shall not be afraid of evil Tidings and his heart is fixed trusting in the Lord isn't it wonderful to trust God and and that he he would give us his word as a way to be able to to be able to Delight in the Commandments of God that he could bring blessings upon our life say see so if a heart is fixed on God God blesses that man it doesn't mean you don't go through trials God chases those he loves it don't mean you don't you don't go through things he molds us he shapes us he's always working on us to develop us into what what he wants us to be brother Mark but it but but just because you go through things don't mean God has stopped blessing you just because you're going through a trial don't mean God has stopped blessing you you're still a Son of God and you're still a daughter of God but you go through things so that God can shape you it's that that is a blessing of God if God would shape you and make you something greater you ought to consider it a blessing I'm going through a trial sometimes it's hard to look at the trial and say well this is God's blessing but God is blessing you by shaping you and molding you and bringing you into the image that he had for you see there's things in our life many things that brings about blessings and curses I could I'm not I'm not going to go through all these this morning because we got started a little late but maybe just to touch on on a couple but there's many scriptures in the Bible that speaks of the blessings of God and I I don't know about y'all but I say Amen into all of them am I the am I the only person that thinks that way I want every blessing that God has promised to this generation I want every bit of it I want I want all that God has to give I'll accept it Lord if you got something special for me this morning I want it if you got something Supernatural I want it if you got a miracle Lord I want it if you want to speak to My Heart Lord I want to hear from you I want the blessings of God on my life I want him to bless me in every aspect of my life I want him to bless my home I want him to bless my family I want him to bless my job I want him to bless the the church I want him to bless my children and my friends I I want to see the blessings of God I have a desire for it I say Amen to it all so the Bible says you are many curses and blessings we'll find many scriptures Malachi the third chapter can I show you some ways to receive a blessing from God Malachi third chapter said here bring in tithing to the storehouse that there may be meat in my house and prove me this is where God says challenge me sayeth the Lord if I will not open the windows of heaven and pour you out a blessing that there shall not be room enough to receive it that's a promise from God isn't that a wonderful promise here friends I could go through testimonies of our or spend hours of what God has done in my life from that one scripture many scriptures that bring blessings from God even children being obedient to your parents the Bible says honor your father and mother that thy days may be long upon the land that God gave you isn't it wonderful the that that that would bring an eternal life by honoring your father and mother Proverbs 11 said you can receive a blessing from from God by sowing into the lives of others say see he that scattereth increaseth but he that withholdeth he tendeth to Poverty he that WTH will also be watered isn't that wonderful see God's showing us ways even James four would write about it to receive a blessing he said well then pray and ask God for it for the right reasons say see you have not because you ask not and you ask and receive not because you ask a miss and you consume it by your own lust so here he shows us that it's God 's desire that you would be blessed and not cursed how many say Amen to that how many really believe that it's God's desire that you would be blessed and not be cursed I've heard so many people that that that that take this Bible and use it as a way to hold people and curse people but don't you realize it's not God's desire that his people would ever live under a curse it was God's desire that you would live under the blessings of God so see this is God's desire from the beginning when he made man you realize that when God created man man wasn't made under a curse he was made under a blessing he was blessed he lived in a in this Garden can I just preach just a few minutes he he lived in this Garden condition brother Mark it was a perfect condition he he could walk and have communion with God but because of the fall in the garden and when that man had fallen and Eden had fallen then it brought the curse of of the law of sin and death upon mankind see isn't it something that before that there was no curse but now because of that fall then every person that's born into this world is born under the same curse they're born under the curse of this flesh we battle with it we go we get up in the morning and we struggle with it we Face things that that are in this flesh because of the curse we get old and we and we try to find ways to make our make ourselves look young again we're trying to do everything you can to to to go against the curse that God has put on us because of the fall in the garden isn't it something this this is where the curse came from Brother Mar but the curse when it came you realize that it was from the fall of one man but the curse was to all mankind isn't it something that this curse it went to every family it went upon the whole world that received the same curse from the fall of one man in or one woman here when they they fa brother Mark this curse that came to every family there's nobody exempt from it you can't be born wealthy enough to be exempt from this curse it don't matter how much money you have your daddy could be the king over the greatest country but when you're born into this world you're born under the same curse and in a few years you'll leave this world and go right back to the dust that you came in see it's the curse that we're born under but isn't this something that God he would not leave the world in that kind of a curse see but God made a way for the curse to be removed he made a way for you to overcome it he made a way for it to be lifted I I thought isn't it something that here whenever God comes remember whenever God came and he began to deal with Abraham isn't it something that here was Abraham let me preach to you I'm I'm I'm about to get to my sermon but whenever God began to speak to Abraham do you realize that Abraham was born under the same curse you were born under how many Say Amen he was the same kind of man you are he was born under the same curse you were born under but when God came to talk to Abraham God didn't come and speak to Abraham about no curse he came to talk to Abraham about a blessing that he was going to put on his life here was a man that was born under a curse but when God come he said he was so blessed of God he said I'll even bless those that bless you and I'll curse those that curse you and in these shall all the families of the earth be blessed he was a man that was born under a curse but received a blessing from God listen he said in you shall all the families of the earth be blessed now how many knows what that word blessed means and that that word blessed you can read it in the Greek it's the word Barak B- a r a k Barack and so this word actually means to receive a blessing or to receive a gift from God and so this is what God is saying to Abraham he said in thee shall all the families of the earth be blessed in other words there's something inside of you that'll be a blessing it'll be a gift that I'll give to all to every family in the earth it was an opportunity where all the families were cursed it was a way that all the families would receive a blessing from God and Paul tells us what this blessing was just so it's not a mystery Paul said in Galatians the thir third chapter he said Christ has redeemed us from the curse of the law being made a curse for us for it is written cursed is everyone that hangeth on a tree that The Blessing of Abraham might come on the Gentiles through Jesus Christ that we might receive the promise of the spirit through faith isn't that something brother Mark see so he shows us that the promise of the spirit would be given not to the Natural Seed of Abraham but it would be given to the faith Seed of Abraham so it's not so here he would give this to us you say well well brother Matt if I was like Abraham well then I could be a real Christian you know if God had given me that promise like that well sure I'd be able to walk like Abraham walked If I Had The Blessing of Abraham then I'd be a then I'd be a real believer if I if I had that same promise he had but says see but you but you do have it if you're Christ's seed see you're dead in Christ you received the Holy Spirit you are Abraham's seed because Christ was Abraham seed you see that it puts it inside of us working that we can have faith in God here the very thing that God has promised to Abraham and in him that very thing that was in him in his seat he was speaking of Christ he said then the church by faith can have that same promise of God Paul said it was the promise of the Holy Spirit you said well brother Matt how do I know that I'm Abraham seed well let me give you an identifying characteristic brother B said to be Abraham's seed you would never back up at a promise of God now how means Abraham's seed he said to be Abraham's seed you'll always keep God's promise and you let that be the truth no matter what anything else said that's what Abraham did no matter what anybody said it didn't matter what they said it didn't mean nothing to him God said so and that settled it to Abraham he said so that's the way Abraham looked at things and that's the way Abraham's seed looks at things see so how many are Abraham's seed how many can say I'll let God's word be true and let everybody else's word be alive let God's word let it resonate in my heart and let every other word go that may if somebody would come by and they would say well well there ain't no God I'll take what God said about it if they say there ain't no such a thing as healing anymore I'll take what God said about it but you prayed over that lady and she died the next day I'll take what God said about it it don't matter how many fall or how many die or how many would go by the way of the Grave I'll take what God said about it he said he'll let God's word be true and let every man's word be a lie there ain't coming no Rapture we're too late in the age I've heard that for a hundred years there ain't going to be no such a thing as a Rapture that's just some book that men made I'll take what God Said and let every man's word be a liive this message ain't true anyway I'll take what God Said and let let every man's word be a liive I want to know how many today would say I'll take the word of God that's a true sign that you're the Seed of Abraham is you'll take the word of God over the voice of every man you'll take it over over the voice of every doubt of every every criticism of every every reasoning anything that Satan would bring to your mind you say I'll take the word of God over every voice over every reasoning over every Spirit I'll take the word of God see sometimes the people of God we get caught up in bad counsel amen somebody sometimes we get caught up with in bad counsel the Bible tells us the story of balam remember balum was here as a prophet as a minister that was out ministering to God's children the Bible tells us as as as balum would lead them and he led them in the wrong direction the Bible says that balam caused them to commit trespasses against the Lord because of his false teaching that they trespassed against God because of a false teaching and the Bible says that a plague Came Upon the whole congregation my isn't that something that here were innocent children that were caught up in a a plague because of uh trespasses that were committed by other people but a plague Came Upon the whole congregation I thought isn't that the way it was in the beginning the fall of one brought a curse to all people get so caught up in the curse for the market such a they look at the curse they're looking at the failures of the curse it's our feelings our emotions are caught up in it you we we have loved ones that go by the way of the Grave we get so caught up in in emotions because we're living in this curse we we we we we have these the feelings of this flesh we're we're just so caught up in it and and I thought my isn't it something that we we look at the curse and we look at the failures and we look at the problems and and we keep our eye on these things so many times and I thought my but if bad advice and false teaching could bring a congregation under a curse if if if that could bring the whole congregation under a curse then what would happen if the people had true teaching what would happen if they had a true Prophet if a false prophet could bring a curse upon the whole congregation or a plague on the congregation then what about a true Prophet isn't that the way it is so many people today say well beware of prophets the Bible didn't say that the Bible said Beware of false prophets thank God for the true ones thank God that there's men that God has used to be able to speak the word of God that you could be believe it as a Believer and bring the blessings of God upon your life and not live under a curse I thank God for True teaching I thank God for for true the true word of God I thank God today for True Holy Ghost filled men that still allow the spirit of God to fall upon them and anoint the preaching of the word I thank God for people that'll allow the anointing of God to come down in the church and begin to minister to their hearts I thank God that it ain't a ritual to us I thank God it ain't just something that we go do on Sunday and Wednesday to have something formal to have some status but we believe in the anointing of the baptism of the Holy Ghost we believe in the preaching of the Gospel of Jesus Christ I still believe God uses men to speak to our hearts I still believe God gets a hold of people I I still believe there's a people that cares enough about God that they'll listen to what God has to say I believe it I believe that everything's not a curse see they were overcame by a curse the the whole world they're overcame by a curse but I think it's time that we forget about the curse and be overcome by the blessings of God I think it's time to get our eyes off the curse and get our eyes on the blessing we ought to change the very things that we think and the things that we say every day look at the curse every day look at the flesh every day look at the fall every day look at my failure look at this look at the problems that I have but friends I think we ought to get up in the morning and every day say Lord I Thank you for the blessings that you brought to my life I thank you for my family I thank you for the church I go to I thank you for the preaching of the word I thank you for the gospel I thank you for men and women that'll stand for truth seems like all we talk about is the curse the curse the curse but I think we ought to change our speech Lord I Thank you in the face of a curse in in the face of the Flesh in the face of failures we ought to be able to overlook the failure and say Lord I Thank you for the blessings my I may not feel like praising God I don't feel like coming out from behind this pull pit but Lord I say thank you this morning I thank you for the blessing that you put on my life Lord I Thank you for the ability to get out of the way and allow you to speak to your children Lord I Thank you for your word I thank you for the Holy Ghost I think we ought to thank God for the many blessings that he give us if we ever get to a place Brother David where we come into the position with God that we can that we can receive the blessing of God I know who I am see this is where people have failed to understand the position that we're in the position you're in brings a blessing from God this is what Moses wrote Deuteronomy he said it shall come to pass they shall hearken diligently under the voice of the Lord they shall Lord thy God to observe and to do his Commandments which command thee this day that the Lord thy God will set thee high above the nations of the earth and all the blessings shall come on thee and overtake thee glory to God that makes me want to Shadow over this building the blessings of God will overtake thee anybody catch that that means to overcome you hello somebody that means the blessings of God will overcome you overtake means to overwhelm you overtake means to outshine you isin't that good to outshine you the very thing that the curse of this flesh and the way we look at ourselves but the blessings of God will outshine you it means to catch and to surpass your expectations that's what God said he said that the blessings of God would overtake you I don't know about you friends but I want to be overtook by the blessings of almighty God I say Lord overtake me Let It outshine My Flesh Lord let it out Shine the curse that I was born under Lord let it be be so overwhelmed by the blessings of God that I can't see the curses that are in this world he said I they'll overtake you and blessed you'll be in the city and bless you'll be in the field blessed shall be the fruit of your body and the fruit of the ground and the fruit of your cattle and the flocks of your sheep blessed shall you be in the baset and blessed shall you be in the store blessed shall you be when you come in and blessed you be when you go out now isn't that the way it is today people are fighting to receive this blessing from God Paul said it's God's Gift they're fighting to receive it but David I want to I want to be able to get it I I want to have that blessing I want the blessing of God to overtake me in such a way that I know who I am to bring me into my rightful place with God everybody wants to get it but you you realize friends but the reality is it ain't you getting it it's it getting you see we look at that wrong I'm going to go get it I'm I'm going to go track it down I'm going I'm going to lay a hold of the Holy Ghost I'm going to get a hold of God but it ain't you getting it it's it getting you what you do is just surrender to what God has sent over overtake you with but said heavens and earth have met God and man is reconciled and a restored Eden has begun see all the curse is gone amen all the curse is gone just like all the curse of sin is gone when the Holy Ghost accepts you man that makes me feel good just like the curse of sin is gone when the Holy Ghost accepts you see you don't accept it it accepts you see cuz it's God's attribute it's the Holy Ghost it means it's God's spirit it's the attribute the thought of God and he has accepted you because you were ordained for that purpose my you mean ordained yeah like Abraham was remember you don't you did you see whenever God came to Abraham Abraham didn't go to God and say Lord if you'll Lift Me Up and exalt I'll exalt thine name then if you'll make me a great nation I'll serve you then Lord if you'll make my name great I'll be something special it had nothing to do with what Abraham said the Bible says God came to Abraham and the Lord said to him it wasn't what Abraham said it was the Lord said he was ordained for it Abraham didn't choose God God chose Abraham somebody say amen he was an ordinary man living an ordinary life and God came down into his life he said I will make thee a great nation I Will Bless Thee I will make thy name great and you shall be a blessing all he did was choose to believe and he started walking in the blessing that God had called him to he could have went the wrong way he could have made mistakes he had flesh just like you and I but there was something down on the inside of him that was greater than the flesh it was greater than the curse he was born under it was something that God had called him to and friends let me tell you when God came in and said I will I will I will you shall Abraham said Lord I believe it and he started walking but Mar there was not one thing in this world that was going to stop him from taking another step he said I was giv a blessing by almighty God oh Abraham you're born under a curse but I've been blessed by God I'll take another step been blessed of God he said it's born you were born in sin and but God had that attribute and here you've expressed yourself here on Earth he comes down and he gets you it's God that accepts you see you're back here you're back here but here's where you belong and so God comes down and he gets you and he brings you to where you belong he says see now when God has a hold of you then sin has lost its power the desire of sin has gone from your heart when the Holy Spirit comes in and you are a restored person my why are you accepted man it makes me want to shout all over this building why are you accepted brother M cuz you was ordained to be accepted is't that something ordained for the purpose of being accepted by God by God that's my new favorite quote you was ordained for the purpose of being accepted by God isn't that always been the question that was the question that Cain and Abel had when they made their sacrifices would God accept their sacrifice remember Cain was upset because his wasn't accepted that's what happened with Solomon when he went and built the temple and he done everything according to the word of God and at the end of it and he went in the temple he said Lord would you come down and vindicate that you've accepted what we've done they were looking to be accepted by God Elijah on Mount carel all those 450 prophets was looking for their God to come and be able to to be able to to burn the the altar but Elijah said let the god that anth by fire be God and then whenever he got the altar built he poured the water on it but Mark he done everything he prepared in every way he said Lord now God Of Heaven he said to prove that you've accepted the sacrifice would you come and light this on fire he proved Elijah was accepted by God prove that Solomon was accepted by God proed that Abel was accepted by God how did he do it God came and he accepted them by accepting their sacrifice my isn't that the question I wonder if God will accept me let me give you the answer I'm not going to preach all day but let me give you the answer brother B said you were ordained for the purpose of being accepted by God Amen somebody I wonder if he'll accept my repentance you were ordained for the purpose of being accepted by God I wonder if he'll accept my worship you were ordained for the purpose of being accepted by God I wonder if he'll accept My Sacrifice he was ordained for the purpose of being accepted by God you say oh brother man I know what they say you get to preaching like this and the people rise up and say well you're just preaching a feel-good message well if it is one it's working cuz I feel pretty good about being ordained of being accepted by God I feel good about being accepted by God I feel good that I was ordained to be accepted by almighty God that means I was ordained that I couldn't be rejected I was ordained that I couldn't be cast side I was ordained that I couldn't be thrown away the world throws you away when they're done with you God don't throw you away you when you fall I done fell so far I don't have nothing else to offer when you have nothing else to offer the the the boss will fire you when you get too old the'll throw you in a nursing home the world gets done with you God don't do it he was ordained for the purpose of being accepted by God how do I know God will accept me because of who you are my because of who you are Jesus preached the whole sermon I'm going close with this point Jesus preached a whole sermon on in Matthew the 5th chapter this is what I preached the series on a few years ago he said blessed are the poor in spirit blessed are the meek blessed are they which hunger and thirst blessed are the merciful blessed are the pure in heart blessed are the peacemakers see when you read this many Bible translations y'all remember when you read many of the translations actually interpret this as happy are those happy are the meek happy are the those that hunger and thirst after rightness but that is not even close to what that means they didn't just mean they're happy see there's a this word is so much deeper this word and not like Barack where it was just a gift but this word is the Greek word macaros how many remembers that a few years ago macaros it means that they are supremely blessed in other words by definition they were they were by extension blessed other words there was something that was a higher power that by extension of that higher power these people were a blessed people in other words they were fortunate many many would look at it in a carnal way and they'd say Well they're well off they're well off they're fortunate people matter of fact in the ancient days if You' read ancient texts and but you'll find out that when they Ed this word macaros in the Greek this word's actually used to describe people that that other people felt like they these people lived above the world they lived above worldly pressure they lived above all the the stresses of the world they were so well off that the things the ordinary things of Life had no effect on them at all this is the word maros they were they were just in a in another place it's almost when you read this in some old text it was almost as if they weren't even in this world this is them kind of people in the natural so when used properly you find this word maros is actually showing how God extended his benefits it's not an emotion it's not just God giving you a gift it's not just an outpouring of the spirit it's not but it's actually a position that you live in brother Mark tow when people would look at it and say that's the Blessed th those are those are the bless that's the that's the bless of God those are the those are the those are the Blessed people it describes the position of the Bride after receiving the favor of God so watch how we say it we say well if I do then I'll be blessed but that ain't the way it is but it's because you're blessed then you do it's because of who you are Jesus said blessed are the poor in spirit for theirs is the kingdom of God you are blessed you are the the Blessed of God that's why you are Meek that's why you that's why you are that's why you are humble that's why you do forgive that's why that's why you do uh you do have a pure heart that's why you are a peacemaker because you're the Blessed of God you don't become the Blessed because you are a peacemaker you're a Peacemaker because you are the Blessed this is the position that we're in matter of fact this name has such a great meaning this is the very same name that was given to God by Apostle Paul this is how he describes God the same word macaros he said according to the Glorious Gospel of the Blessed God which hath committed to my trust First Timothy un the appearing of our Lord Jesus Christ which in his times he shall show who is the blessed and the only potentate the king of kings and the Lord of host Now isn't it something that the same word that Paul uses to describe God is the same word that Jesus uses to describe you that's hard to swallow isn't it Paul used this word said this is what God is he's a blessed God Jesus uses this word to Define you blessed are the poor in spirit blessed are the meek blessed are the humble blessed are the peacemakers ain't it something see it's hard for us to look at oursel that way is that when I said that I could feel that all over the building that you mean Paul called God that and now he's calling it yeah but that was God this is you know we're people after all we were born under a curse after all we're a part of creation after all we have failures after all I live in the flesh see it's hard to accept that it's hard to say yeah I I'll accept being called that because you know I I barely get by being a Christian I can hardly get get through one day to another you see I found in the scripture there was another person that was used to the same name was used to describe it was when the angel came to a little girl by the name of Mary and when Gabriel came to her friends do you realize that Gabriel came to Mary not because of how good Mary was but because of who Mary was it wasn't out all the works that she had done and how the effort that she had put it was because of who she was matter of fact when the angel came to her the Bible says he said there are highly favored the Lord is with thee and blessed art thou among women see the angel he didn't tell her you're going to receive a blessing he said you are blessed macaros he said blessed art thou among women TR think of this this is how she felt just like you feel when I say that about you she felt the same way she said the Bible says she was troubled at his saying and she said cast in her mind what kind of greeting is this and the angel said to her fear not for you have found favor with God is't that something you can find yourself in this whole story God says you're a blessed people Lord I know but look at look at my life and look at the condition look at what I what the the the mistakes I've made look at my past look where I've been he says but fear not for you have found favor can somebody put theirself in this story this morning this is for you but fear not you have found favor with God and behold that shall you shall conceive in thy womb and bring forth the son and you shall call his name Jesus and he'll be great and he'll be called the son of the highest and the Lord will give him the Throne of David and he'll Reign Over The House of Israel and the kingdom there shall be no end then said marri to the angel how shall this be why because she's just like us how can that be how can that happen to somebody like me now watch what the angel does to prove it to her he starts to testify to her of Supernatural and he starts to share testimonies of what God has already done I love the Angel's answer maybe you've never just slowed down and read it but the Bible says the angel answered unto her how can this be he said the Holy Ghost shall come upon thee isn't that something it overtook her the Holy Ghost shall come upon you it wasn't something that she accepted it was something that accepted her say see there it wasn't something she went to get brother Mark she couldn't go work it up and make it happen it accepted her he said the Holy Ghost shall come upon thee the power of the highest shall overshadow you therefore the holy thing that shall be born of thee shall be called The Son of God and behold thy cousin Elizabeth she has conceived a son in her old age and is in her sixth month with her child and she was called baren so so he tells her what's going to happen to her and vindicates it by telling her a testimony of a baren woman that's all of a sudden having a child and the Bible says and then Mary listen as she's hearing this the angel says even though it seems like that you're not that even though it seems like you're lowly even though it seems like you're under a curse but the angel says but for with God nothing shall be impossible so you know what that tells me it don't matter how bad you are or what kind of curse you're under or how bad the devil's made you feel like you are if you're part of the Bride of Jesus Christ you're not what the devil says about you say see with God nothing shall be impossible he can get you out of the lowest hole he can go to the lowest pit let me tell you something about my God my God can walk right in a drug housee and drag somebody out of it he'll overtake them my God can take somebody off a bar stol and bring them in the house of God and set them and establish them in the word of God why he has the ability to overtake you sir said before God nothing shall be impossible how many remembers what Mary said she said well be it unto me according to Thy word why cuz she was a Seed of Abraham I'll let the word of God be be greater than the word of any man maybe there was some around her Mary you can't do that be it unto me according to Thy word Mary you're just a little girl be it unto me according to Thy word Mary you're you're a nobody you're just raised in a in a in a messed up family be it unto me according to Thy word I'll take the word of God God over what anybody says because she was a Seed of Abraham and the Bible says Mary went down she be to testify to Elizabeth of all the things that she had just seen and it wasn't very long them two pregnant ladies was having a Pentecostal Jubilee right down in the living room they they began to shout and praising God and Elizabeth began to talk about how wonderful God is she said my Mary with a loud voice she said blessed art thou the Bible says and Mary said my soul magnifies the Lord and my spirit has rejoiced in God the Savior you said what were they shouting about why was there so much joy why why why what caused the Revival in Mary the Bible says listen can we show this scripture Luke the first chapter brother Tim Luke the first chapter 48th verse Mary said listen what she said what what caused a jubilee for he hath regarded the lowest state of his handmaiden for behold from hence forth all generations shall call me blessed isn't it something listen what CED the joy to come to marry God has regarded my estate God saw me in this condition God knew I would be in this curse God knew I would be born to who I would be born to God knew I would go through the things that I would go through he saw me in this lowest state but from now on all generations shall call me blessed my what a jubilee it brought see first it was how I see me and second it's how God sees me may you stand to your feet this morning see because of who she was listen Mary didn't go around saying a virgin shall conceive a virgin shall conceive she went and she manifested what God said about her see there's a lot of people go around quoting stuff but there a difference between quoting something and living something that's like we today we don't go around saying the just shall live by faith the just shall live by faith we don't just go around saying it me we tell you what the bride does she lives by faith we don't go around well after all Jesus is the same yesterday today and for forever we don't just go around quoting it but we live it and let the life of Jesus Christ be manifested in you you see that's what the world wants to see they want to see something real you say well brother man well that was Mary she was highly favored what about me what about you can I answer that that was Mary she was highly favored but what about me where's my Gabriel everybody's looking for their angel where's my Gabriel to come and and say I was blessed in that way to come and meet me on the road and say you're blessed and highly favored friends I got something this morning that's a lot greater than Gabriel you remember when Jesus was preaching remember he went out brother Mark and the woman screamed out while he was preaching she saw the Miracles that were done and she screamed out she said blessed is the womb that bear thee and the breast that nurse thee and Jesus turned to her he said yay but rather I say blessed are they that hear the word of God and keep it my isn't this something Mary was blessed but Jesus said but more blessed are they that hear the word and keep it see the word is a seed just like Mary there was a seed that was placed in her it was the literal life of God and that word was made flesh and it was placed in the womb of a woman here she as being a top of the Bride of Jesus Christ how many knows that that the that the word would be placed into the the womb of the heart of the Bride that and that word as Jesus said it was a seed it would be placed in her and there wouldn't be no other seed that's Mary was a virgin was a virgin whenever the seed was placed there he said see it would come to a virgin virgin birth said that's the same way it is with a bride she wouldn't allow any other seed we're not they're not going to allow something else to come in or some some Doctrine or some foolishness of man where Abraham seed there ain't but one seed it's Christ the word that'll ever be placed into the womb of the Bride of Jesus Christ she see it's because of who you are and I think isn't it something that the bride has carried that word the seed that was planted he this this body of Believers the Bride of Jesus Christ she's carried that word and we've saw it come to life brother the mark even in the time that that we live in as it as it's grown in the hearts of Believers how many say brother Matt I'm glad to be a part of that let me read this as we're closing brother Braham said here's the secret how many wants to hear it he said here's the secret the word is in the bride and the mind of Christ to know what he wants done with the word and she does it in his name she has thus sayith the Lord then it's deratization serves his purpose and then they will do only his will and no one can persuade them different I is this something brother the David the Bride is a blessed people for the word of God is in her and the mind of God is in her to know what he wants done with it my I think that's just that's just a a powerful thought this morning the word is in you and the mind of God is in her to know what he wants done with his word she won't abuse it she won't use it to abuse anybody the word is in her and the mind of God is in her my what a what a blessed people you are blessed and highly favored blessed art thou among women this Bride is a special Church she's a special class of people blessed art thou among women many churches around the world many beliefs many doctrines but blessed art thou among women thou art highly favored my a't it wonderful this morning amen want somebody just give the Lord another hand clap of Praise this morning how many how many's a
