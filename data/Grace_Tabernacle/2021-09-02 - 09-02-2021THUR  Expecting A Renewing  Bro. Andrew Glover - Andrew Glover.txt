see it isn't it amen i think of what david said come let us rejoice and look at the lord's doing amen i just couldn't help but a few minutes ago step out of the office and step in the back there and just thinking brother matt a few short years ago standing back there and the power of god swarming through here and couldn't even stand the office for the presence of god and to see curtains up and different things but to stand back there tonight and see what god has done we thank the lord for it don't we amen this is the lord's doing and it's marvelous in our sight amen let's buy our hits together this evening how many would say lord come by my way tonight we're here to honor you we're here to worship you heavenly father lord as your believing children have gathered themselves together here this afternoon lord as it has already been mentioned lord that for several times they've tried to plan these meetings and lord something's happened diseases through the land viruses lord and they've had to be canceled i believe it's been twice now and no doubt down in hell when the devil got news that these meetings were canceled he rejoiced he was happy and lord he's been working overtime to hinder these meetings but lord we stand here tonight and we rejoice to look at hell and the devil tonight and say satan you didn't have enough to stop this church you didn't have enough to stop these meetings you don't have enough to stop these believers lord as i heard your prophet say today we ask you to dispatch the angels of god into this building as we ask you to anoint it and dedicate dedicated for your honor and your glory lord as we endeavor tonight to look into your word we know there's a spiritual warfare going on the devil's doing everything he can to beset the blessings of your children but father as bethlehem dwellers tonight we draw our sword and we're going to fight through this line of unbelieving spirits it would try to hinder your believers lord i believe there's miracles already in the building tonight i believe signs and wonders are already here tonight they're gone now father as the songs of zion have been sung the atmosphere has been created lord as we now join our faith together lick of fire to lick a fire tonight lord we ask you to come take prohibits in these meetings from the first song god until the last prayer that will be prayed lord may you have the preeminence in every aspect father lord the men of god that are coming this week lord may you anoint him mightily lord father as i would just say it this way hell is in trouble this weekend father lord we know there's already wonderful things happening and we look to see more father we commit these meetings into your hands help us to not god to get ourselves out of the way that for just a few moments of time tonight dear god we could forget about time we could forget about the cares of life the situations of the day and we could look into your word and father we'll be sure whatever is accomplished here we'll be sure to give you all the praise all the honor and all the glory for it's in the wonderful name of our lord and savior jesus christ we pray and all the believer says amen and amen and amen god bless you this evening amen as you're standing if you have your bibles we'll invite you to the book of psalms the 60 chapter the book of psalms the 62nd chapter while you're turning there this evening we want to greet you in the name of the lord we sure sure counted an honor and a privilege to be here with you all uh this evening and appreciate the invitation to come amen appreciate brother matt allowing us to come be a part of the meetings and tell you it's a special time isn't it amen we want to say god bless you to all the men of god that's

tonight and good good to have all the visitors here brother ben god bless you this evening good to see you buddy and also brother ben goss and his mother from over in mississippi mississippi is here tonight it's good to have you all here with us god bless you all amen and all the visitors it's here amen aren't we aren't we under expectation this weekend amen i believe it's time to just go ahead and say something good is not going to happen it's already happening amen amen the book of psalms the 62nd chapter and the fifth verse david here writing says my soul wait thou only upon god for my expectation is from him david here is not writing about his flesh or his spirit he's writing about his soul my soul wait thou only upon god for my expectation is from him also i would like to look in the book of second corinthians the fifth chapter second corinthians the fifth chapter i've got a few verses there i'd like to read this evening second corinthians 5 and verse 16. you love the lord this evening amen the bible here says paul writing he says wherefore henceforth know we know man after the flesh yea though we have known christ after the flesh yet henceforth now we know him know we him no more and therefore if any man be in christ somebody say christ he is a new creature old things are passed away and behold all things are become new and all things are of god who hath reconciled us to himself by jesus christ and have given to us the ministry of reconciliation to wit that god was in christ reconciling the world unto himself not imputing their trespasses unto them and hath committed unto us the word of reconciliation now then we are ambassadors for christ as though god did beseech you by us we pray you in christ's stead be you reconciled to god for he hath made him to be sin for us who knew no sin that we might be made the righteousness of god in him we ask the lord this evening to add the blessing to the reading of his word as you can be seated this afternoon from those scriptures tonight for just a few moments i would like to speak to you on the fault of expecting a renewing of our experience expecting a renewing of our experience and we're all very well aware that the prophet of god told us that we get what we expect right if we're expecting good things we're going to receive good things if we're expecting bad things we're going to receive bad things and brother branham preaches the message expectations many many times but actually i was just listening this week to when he preached it down in jonesborough 1953 he said now brother have you lived around arkansas here about all your life in a discernment i suppose he said well that's fine now it's 50 years that's a great state he said everywhere i went in the world nearly i found somebody look like from arkansas he said i say this one thing he says the arkansas people i don't say this because i'm before this microphone but the angel of the lord is here at this platform i have never found in the world he says any nicer more faithful and lovely people than comes out of the state of arkansas because one thing they're not the richest people of the world but they still got the old american traits of believing god and living right amen believe in god and living right brother called that two american traits and to think tonight amen that at that time america was more of a christian nation than it is today amen but i'm so glad tonight to be gathered here with a group of believers amen that are actually still fulfilling what a prophet said so many many years ago in this building tonight amen is not the not the richest people and not the most famous people amen but in this building tonight is a group of people who still believes god and they're still living right in the face of every devil they still believe god in the face of every unbelieving spirit they still believe god and there's still a desire amen to live for him and to live right then when i think of how at this church as we gather here this weekend amen for a dedication meeting i'll say it like this amen that man has not raised up grace tabernacle amen an organization has not raised up grace tabernacle but god himself amen the same god that raised up solomon's temple and the same god amen that established the ark of the covenant is the same god amen that has raised up grace tabernacle amen and it's not just a church it's not just a gathering of people amen but it is a church of vision for its fulfilling scripture amen where the bible says where there is no vision amen the people perish but he that keepeth the law amen happy is he now the prophet of god will say this in a personal experience with god if anything the church needs tonight and what we're trying to do friends is to bring a fresh vision from the presence of god to let the people see that god still lives amen and reigns and is moving with his church and he will amen until jesus comes amen how many believes god is still alive how many believes that god is still moving amen how many believes that god is still reigning they've been right here in a wicked and adulterous generation when they have forsaken the things of god amen there is a group of people here tonight amen that are witnesses that god is a reality he is alive and well the same god amen that said let there be is the same god that is in this field and amen the same god that went by blind bartimaeus it's the same god amen that's in this building tonight the same god and forgive the woman at the well is the same god that is in this building tonight he has not changed he still remains a god of reality then as we're here tonight there is a hunger amen there is a thirst the prophet said it this way he said i'm thanking thee father first to be alive here tonight he said oh how satan would desire amen to take us quickly from the scene right in the midst of the battle amen but the angels are encamped about those amen who fear him and we are thankful for this and i am so glad for a fresh experience of knowing amen the reality of his promise that then the promises of god tonight are not just scriptures they're not just quotes amen they're not just things that you hear a preacher say amen but the promises of god are a reality god is not looking for somebody amen to rewrite the promises he is not looking for somebody amen to explain the promises he is looking for somebody who will believe the promises and surrender their hearts to god and allow the promises to become manifested in their flesh amen then there is a promise tonight amen that every man woman boy and girl can't have he meant an experience with the living god in the message the rapture he says i think amen they didn't speak and i don't want to get up here and just say something as i as i feel led to say it that i think would be a help to you amen i want to say something that would further your experience with god he said that if you are a christian and if you're not a christian would make you so ashamed of yourself amen that you would become a christian see that's the purpose that i've always tried to line my thoughts up with amen then tonight we are not gathered here as church members amen we are not gathered here as just religious people amen but we are gathered here as christians amen which are the children of god amen not by denomination not by title amen but by an experience see we are not the grandchildren of god amen we are the children of the living god that's why john would say beloved amen i love this he didn't say brother david in the future he didn't say someday coming he said but beloved now are we the sons of god and it does not yet appear what we shall be amen but we know that he shall appear amen we shall be like him for we shall see him as he is the prophet said one thing i find amen the greatest hindrance among us is that you're trying to place the things of god way out there yet to come he said when you're right in the middle of it now amen listen revival is not coming amen tomorrow night or saturday night or sunday morning revival is here right now your deliverance is not coming in the future it is here right now your miracle is not coming in the future it is here right now your breakthrough is not coming in the future it is here right now we are not going to be victorious we are victorious we are not going to be overcomers we are overcomers and to think tonight these things are not in the future amen the prophet said we are now in the holy ghost age we are now sons of god we are now seated together in heavenly places not we will be but we are now this afternoon right here now somebody say that with me right here now amen not tomorrow night not two weeks off but right here now we are the sons and daughters of god they've been seated together in heavenly places in christ jesus he said see all things are possible being how many beliefs tonight that all things are possible right now they make many claim today to be the children of god while they're putting the promises off in the future while they're looking for something to come amen people sit on pews amen as half-born children amen as part born children but the prophet said we cannot go in on papa's experience we cannot go in on mama's experience he meant you've got to have your own experience amen this is what their birth was you have to have a birth too he said you're a grandchild amen until you're born of the spirit of god amen then you become a child amen now as we begin to look at this tonight we realize there's many things in our natural life that has to be renewed can you say amen amen there's many materialistic things that has to be renewed we have to renew our insurance policy we have to renew our driver's license right we have to renew different contracts amen the world is constantly asking for us to renew something amen but let me say this we are not necessarily gathered here amen just to renew old friendships we're not just gathering here to renew amen ideas about the message we have come here tonight amen to renew our experience amen not in a historical god amen and not a god that was or a god that will be amen brother wayne but a god that is here right now he's been present to do exceedingly and abundantly above all that we could ever ask or thank amen let me set this way we're not here amen just to renew our church experience amen i know there's many people that's had bad church experiences amen but let me just go and tell you right now amen you might have had a bad church experience amen but no one and hear me well amen no one has ever had a bad experience with christ you may have had a lot of bad experiences with churches you may have had a lot of bad experiences with church people you may have a lot of bad experiences everywhere amen but i have searched my bible amen i have searched the message amen and i have yet to find one person that ever had a bad experience with jesus christ you know why amen because he is the power of god he is the deliverance he is the joy amen won't we just go ahead tonight and lay the red carpet out and say lord you're the unseen guest but become the visible cast we don't just want to hear a bunch of sermons we want an experience amen when we leave here we want an experience we want more than just an idea we want something burning in the depths of our soul brother brown said it this way he said we're getting people to church and not to christ amen i'm going to cut the devil's head off here right now he never said we are getting the people to the message and not to christ go read the quote more and more i am made to believe amen that people are not getting to christ amen i believe that's the enemy that's thrown this hindrance amen because the reason i believe this is he is not the object that they have been pointed to amen grace tabernacle you can testify amen that since the first bible study amen or the first service you was here you've never been pointed to a man you've never been pointed to a denomination you've never been pointed to a creed amen but service in amen in service now you have been pointed to jesus christ the prophet said they've been pointed to a dogma they've been pointed to a doctrine they've been pointed to a party they've been pointed to an experience or a sensation he said instead of being pointed to christ the word he said and their action and the life they live without christ ain't been proves in their own life is vindicated by the very thing amen now you may be saying i've heard about a man named william branham i've heard about a message of the hour amen what is the message what is the point in it the prophet said the very essence of the message that was sent amen that he is risen from the dead amen from 47 to 65 the very essence of everything you will hear is he is risen from the dead and we are his beneficiaries who share in the resurrection with him we are drawing benefits from him amen not a tradition of a man amen said i'm afraid that too many of us amen here it is again are not getting people to christ we're getting them to a church amen to a theory but we must get them to christ he is the only one the only one that has life he that has the son has life amen in the life of a man that's dead be projected in you you will live the same life that he lived amen let me say this tonight there are amen not beneficiaries coming amen there's beneficiaries here tonight who are not just going to benefit amen from his resurrection in the future amen but they're benefiting from his resurrection amen right here tonight yes sir there is a amen there is a truth here it's not a man it's not a church that truth is jesus christ amen you know as well as i do amen that truth begets truth right amen truth birth is truth amen false birth false amen a true prophet amen will bring true words amen a false prophet will bring false words and the bible says it this way i am the way i am the truth i am the life and no man cometh unto the father amen but by me then may i go on record and say tonight the words of william branham were not false words they were not words of imagination amen they were the words of truth how can you say they were the words of truth amen because of where they were coming from they were not coming from a seminary they were not coming from a denomination amen the word brother david was coming from the throne room amen of the almighty god himself oh come on church amen not for one moment do i bring a message to the people that they may follow me i'm laying a foundation we're going to get this house built quick okay amen they may follow me or join my church i have never done that and i will not do that now amen i am here to accomplish one thing and that thing is to see amen a true established relationship between god and man amen wherein men become new creations in christ he's been filled with his spirit and live according to his word amen now let's have some church here for a minute amen because that's what grace tabernacle is full of amen is full of men women boys and girls who have met not a church they've not met a theory amen but they met a person named jesus christ and they were baptized in his name and then they've been washed by his blood their new creation oh god i can't contain myself they're new creations they've been believing god and living right amen i pray that brother branham can look over the banister tonight he can look in this meeting and say just a few miles down the road i said there was some real people that believed god amen that lived right and here you are tonight not in relationship with a man in relationship with christ who is our experience that's why the bible said if any man be in christ he is a new creature all things are passed away and behold all things are become new in the message you must be born again he said the true word comes to the true prophet he said and you follow that true word and you get a true experience amen of the word because the word is made flesh in you and you become god's son and the world will help me jesus and the word of god is revolving right out of god into you because you are his nature his spirit is in you and you'll do the works of god amen how many will agree with me tonight that in this meeting we're going to see amen the works of god we're going to see signs we're going to see miracles we're going to see wonders we're going to see healing we're going to see deliverance we're going to see families restored we're going to see joy come back we're going to see people get their praise back we're going to see people get their dance back we're going to see people that have had bad experiences with other things come in the presence of jesus christ and not receive a false experience but receive a true experience that will produce a true christian with a true anointing with the true faith oh devil get out of here we're not backing up we're not turning around we know where we're standing tonight we're standing on christ the solid rock all other ground is seeking sand but this message has been through the storm and the storm couldn't destroy it it's been through the fire and the fire couldn't burn it it's been through the hall of credits and they couldn't criticize it enough it's the truth this message is the truth how can you say that because this message is christ and christ is the truth and what are you saying tonight i'm saying christ is here to renew you when you think of the words like renew refresh revive refill refuel recover here's what we're going to do rededicate when you hear those words you realize that the two letters of re amen are prefixes on all those words which when you read the word prefix of read is occurring originally in lone words from latin amen used with the meaning again how you hear me now used with the meaning again or again and again oh god use with again or again and again brother matt it means to indicate repetition in other words the prophet said may this little time of coming together not only be for the edifying of our own souls but may it be to enlighten us in such a way and inspire us to will get to tell others he said may it be a time of rededication we've come to dedicated building amen but the real church is not the building we've come to dedicate this ground to the use of god but brother tim the real church is not this ground he meant the church is sitting on the pews in front of me who has had an experience with what is being lifted up behind this pulpit they've been may it be a time of rededication he says uniting with the full body of christ and being ready for the rapture amen i know we shouldn't go here but i'm going to go here right now amen this is a closing thought but it just come to me amen how would you how would you think amen if you if you was in this meeting this weekend and all of a sudden at some point you begin to feel a cold sweet come over you and you begin to see love once appear and then you know it's not going to be long amen so we're going to get together with the rest of them and in the moment in the twinkling of an eye amen we're going to be changed amen come on church that's not in the future amen the people that's going to fulfill amen the promise of a rapture they are not coming amen they are sitting before me tonight people who's going to see gray hair amen turn back back again are sitting before me tonight amen this is not just some little meeting amen over in the sticks of arkansas amen this is a place where the sons and daughters of god have gathered together under the spout where the glory of god comes out and an inspiration is flowing and a fire is burning and rededication is claiming vessels listen church we could leave here before this service is dismissed tonight there's nothing else coming it is here tonight that's why paul would say or rather peter would say repent you therefore and be converted amen i've got a habit of knocking things over so forgive me i don't care if i knock the water bottle over but i am going to knock that devil over i want to knock that devil over because we didn't come here just for another gathering we didn't come here for a protracted meeting we come here for renewing he said when the times of refreshing shall come from the presence of god the prophet said what we need today is a refreshing amen not a celebration but a feeling let me say this this here this weekend it's not so much a celebration it is a feeling and the prophet said what was the dedication if we'll come back somebody say come back to the original dedication and we'll open our hearts and we'll empty ourselves that god i want you to hear this quote tonight in dedication as we give it to him we'll fill our temple with his second glory then the living god somebody shout the living god will be moving in a living church among a living people and will spread forth his glory then together someday one being this way and one this way and one part of the country she'll come together and make the bride and will be called up in the air to meet him now this lovely church this building that the people with their tokens of their livelihood with their love for christ amen the worshipers has dedicated today the place of worship that people could come and worship now my sincere prayer is that every worship or how many worshipers do we have here tonight every worshiper will dedicate his own temple he meant to worship in the temple amen that's being dedicated for worship amen that's the real dedication so the real dedication is not blessing two befores amen and blessed carpet amen but the real dedication is blessing the real church amen thank god for this build and thank god for what he's provided but let me put hell on notice amen if this building would be washed away in a flood tomorrow if a fire would burn it in god forbid amen devil you wouldn't shut up matt morris you wouldn't shut up grace tabernacle you wouldn't shut up these ministers amen if tomorrow night we had to meet somewhere under a amen and worship believing god we would be there because we've come into more than just the church we have come into christ it is a true relationship it is a permanent relationship oh let's go ahead and preach a minute amen tell that devil you ain't going to destroy this you can't destroy this he's done tried and you're still here well that's a shout point right there he's done trying to quiet you down and every time he tried to climb you down you just got louder he's tried to scare you and every time he tried to scare you you just got more bolder hey then do you know why because there's an inspiration in this church it's not flowing from a man it's pulling from christ absurd i think of how israel on their journey they got dry and they needed a refreshing i think of what david said there amen i love this in psalms 85 verse 6. amen will vow not revive somebody shall revive us again i love this that thy people amen may rejoice in thee amen let me just go and say it's time to rejoice come on it's time to kick out every cold day boy it's time to kick out every bitterness it's time to kick out every spirit that we're trying this is your season to rejoice the bible says that amen revive us again that thy people may rejoice in thee who is thee in christ see then tonight we have he meant a scriptural promise that whatever god did before he will do it again he would slap somebody on the knee and say what he did before he'll do it again amen you ain't going to do that looking at me amen you gotta take your hand and slap somebody on the knee amen whatever god did before he will do it again thank you brother david amen whatever god did before he will do it again amen that's gonna be my confession here tonight amen anybody want to start testifying with me amen you know what i've learned amen a meeting that starts with testimonies ends with more a meeting that starts with testimonies actually ends with more amen i didn't come here to talk about all the negativity i didn't come here to talk about all the problems i come here to let you know if you've seen god say before he's going to do it again if you've seen god deliver before he's going to do it again if you've seen god pour out his spirit before he's gonna do it again amen if any two or three would agree that's touching any one thing on the earth it shall be done in heaven brother matt do you agree with me brother mark do you agree with me and i say open up the windows of heaven god and let it outpour it by the holy ghost and then take the liberty of this speech amen take us beyond just looking at the creature take us into a sphere amen of faith of worship of believing god can still do the impossible amen what he did before he'll do again amen the bible says it this way whatever god does it shall be forever amen hebrews 13 8 says jesus christ is the same amen yesterday today and forever the prophet said here's the revelation god never changes god never changes and his ways are unchangeable as he is here it is amen an unchanging god with unchanging ways well surely brother wayne there's got to be a time he's going to change but a prophet said there will never be a change there will never be a change in what the church was at pentecost amen is the standard amen somebody shout pentecost amen what the church was at pentecost is the standard this is the pattern there is no other pattern no matter what scholar says god has not changed that pattern what god did at pentecost he has to keep on doing until the church ages close will you say mother andrew pentecost amen it's the denomination amen but the prophet said that pentecost is an experience amen pentecost is not a denomination amen pentecost is an experience then he would say what we need is another pentecost in other words what he's going to say is a hundred and seventy million professed christians around the world need is another pentecost amen one is another pentecost it is a renewing of your experience it is a renewing of what god did for you well lord you moved for me five years ago and i'm still thanking you for that amen but do you realize he wants to move for you again tonight amen come on young people amen if he moved for a youth camp in march he's the same god here tonight if he moved at youth camp in louisiana he's the same god here tonight if he moved up in ohio he's the same god here to what are you saying i'm saying amen the sky is the limit to a group of people who will take the breaks off of the spirit of god and let the holy ghost have the right away well brother and you don't know how bad it is i didn't ask you how bad it is i come to tell you it don't matter how bad it is i'm not talking about a god who is limited by the situation who is limited by the darkness of the condition i'm talking about a god who can raise the dead after four days i'm talking about a khan who can raise lazarus whose nose was done fill in are you going to preach with me tonight amen and if he can raise lazarus he can raise you here tonight brother andrew i've been praying for a long time that god's going to bring my child home they're a prodigal amen i heard how he did it for so and so i've heard testimonies how he did it for this brother and for this family amen but i don't know if he can do it for me amen let me say tonight amen he is the unlimited god and what he did for one he'll do for you god is no respect of persons i said god is no respecter persons amen then tonight amen let god renew your faith to believe for the impossible let god renew your faith amen to believe for your miracle let god renew your faith amen to believe for that restoration of that loved one let god renew your faith that that sickness that the doctor said is incurable let god renew your faith tonight amen to say doctor i've heard your report but i've also heard the report of the lord how many can shout tonight lord renew us i am expecting a renewing amen you begin to look to the scriptures and you find things that needs to be renewed david says in psalms 51 verse 10 renew a right spirit isaiah said in isaiah 40 verse 31 renew their strength amen paul says in romans 12 2 amen renew their minds amen in second corinthians 4 16 he says the outward man perish amen but the inward man is renewed and then day by day hey colossians 3 and 10. amen renewed in the knowledge after the image of him that created him peter would say this he would say oh a renewing of the holy ghost amen what is the renewing brother darren amen a renewing is a renovation i love this it is a complete change for the better [Applause] now i'm going to step out of the branch here but i'm not too nervous about stepping out on it amen because i know the men coming behind have been believed what i'm getting ready to say every one of these preachers you're going to hear this week amen believes that a renovation can take place in a vessel that people don't even recognize who they are anymore every one of these men of god amen believes that something can happen in the depths of every believer that'll change them amen will change their faults we'll change their direction we'll change their approach amen tonight we're not looking amen for just to rejoin and we're looking for a renewing the prophet said lord renew us amen renew us from your word amen then tonight when you see amen that word made flesh when you see the word made flesh it's the light of the age when you see it amen then how do you have an experience you have an experience when you see it when you when you believe it when something clicks inside of you daddy that's me amen mama that's me amen then tonight we are the witnesses of the attributes that are in god amen by an experience the angels tonight are witnesses but they're witnesses by hearsay they can hear him say i am a healer but they've never experienced healing they can hear him say i am a deliverer but they've never experienced deliverance they can hear him say amen i am a savior but they've never experienced a savior amen but on earth tonight amen come on church on earth tonight and some witnesses amen that in the other realms of glory amen father is saying i am a healer and there's a house full of believers that stands up and says yes father amen you are a healer how do they know that father by an experience there's one right there amen father says i'm a savior he said how do you know amen there's a group of people on earth that says they were born in sin amen shaping in iniquity and come in the world speaking lies amen but god who is rich in mercy reach down and save the unsavable amen redeem the unredeemable anybody got a righteous shout tonight it's a redeemed anybody got a right to praise god it's the attributes that have experienced amen the very thoughts and mind of god oh my amen you can look at something and still not see it you realize you can look at something and still not see it come on man amen help me preach now you've been there when your wife said go to the store and get something on aisle two in the shelf down there near the end and you went down there and said i looked all over i didn't find it she says well it's there because i just saw it yesterday well i'm standing here looking hey man i'm standing here looking i don't see it amen and she says well i'll come down there look straight ahead brothers and she comes down there and says it's right there do you see what do you see what happened amen amen somebody come by and enlighten you to what you was looking at you was looking at it but you didn't see it but when somebody come on now remember the woman down there that was so poor that they sent welfare to do a check on her and the guy come in there and said your son where is he he's over in some far distant land amen does he not think about you does he not care about you she says oh he sends me the prettiest cards and then she went in there and pulled him off the shelf and she pulled one out that said why we are not a denomination and she pulled another one out come on and said the rapture and she put another one out and said the future home and put another one out and said things are to be pulled another one out and said total deliverance pulled another one out and said the prodigal son pulled another one out he was to pass this one why are you hearing me she had been collecting them even thinking they were just pretty sermons and a man preached 50 years ago amen but god sent a gift by her way and said listen woman amen them are not postcards them are moneygrams and here she had been sitting in church for years amen thinking she was the poorest person in the church when in reality she was the richest person in the entire county well come on church haven't you been sitting back letting the devil tell you because of your mistakes and because of your bloodline and because of what family you come out of there's no way god can use you amen but brother matt i curse that devil in the name of jesus christ and there's some gifts here tonight it's going to reveal to you your father owns the cattle on a thousand hills he is the god that turns water into wine you're not poor you're the richest person in the entire county tonight she was looking at it but she didn't see it she was talking about it but she didn't see it she was listening to it but she didn't see it but one night in a service the holy ghost began to move and the spirit began to sin amen over the hearts of the believers and somebody stood up and said he's still god and somebody else said his word is still true and somebody else said he's the same yesterday today and forever and all of a sudden the angels of god begin to feel the building and people's eyes begin to come open to what they're looking at oh god somebody say open my eyes you realize people can see the prophecy and miss the fulfillment come on they can read zechariah they can read they can read genesis 3 15 brother harvey they can read zachariah 9 they can stand in matthew 21 and say what is the attraction what's all the noise about now come on i'm about to give a disclaimer here amen they're going to make some noise around here this weekend but i felt that devil spirit resistant a person at the devil don't want me to say that but guess what i'll say it again there's gonna be some noise around here this weekend this ain't a funeral home i said this ain't a funeral home this ain't a house of depression this ain't a house of complexes this ain't a house of bitterness this ain't a house of sadness this is a place where the miraculous is transferred this is a place where the power of god amen comes in the meaning and lives are changed forever let me just go and tell that no praise devil you might as well pack your bags and get out of dodge amen because there's some believers here that knows what it's like ain't meant to be sit looking at the postcards and have no understanding of what they are but then a man steps in the building kyle and he turns on the lives and they see they didn't become a son on any certain certain day they always was the son of god they always had a gene seed they always had their name come on church you say why is all these people shouting because they've experienced christ they've experienced more than a church they've experienced more than a picture more than a theory they've experienced christ oh religious people don't like that kind of preaching but i ain't a religious preacher i'm a holy ghost field fire baptized message believing devil stomping amen sin slaying preacher that still believes in a book of acts experience that still believes demons can be cast out that still believes the spirits of oppression can be destroyed in holy ghost-filled meetings anybody else believe it with me anybody else believe it with me there's one there's one there's one there's a group we believe in the supernatural god brother you might as well shout we believe in the power of god we believe in the holy ghost [Music] bill brother andrew i think we better be careful hey man cause we've been having some meetings and there's been some young people getting out of hand there's been a lot of dancing going on huh there's been a lot of dancing going on amen you know what we got we got us a bunch of intellectual giants in the land today that's caught the nerve of the wayne amen to call holy ghost dancing amen bubble dancing but i just happened to have a message church too and i happened to read that message church and i happened to read a prophet saying amen we've got to come somebody shot we got to come to full doctrine he said that's why there's all this bubble dancing amen do you realize there was no full doctrine when they were bubble dancing that's why i entitled it bubble dancing because they didn't have a foundation to dance on when the when the spirit lifted the dance was gone amen but i'm going to preach to you for a second amen because these young people ain't preaching on the g chord of the organ they ain't preaching on the c chord from the guitar they aren't bubble dancing these are boys and girls who have been born under the full word that was promised by revelations 10 has been birthed in the full effect if anybody got a rap against the isles these young people in the message of the hour gotta write today you know why people don't like dancing amen because they don't like victory amen but i love victory and you know what dancing is dancing is a sign of victory well i might as well bulldoze that devil out of the building tonight i said dancing is a sign of victory real preacher i don't think it's plot that somebody stand up in the service well what would you have thought of when william branham hung his leg across a pulpit and stood there and danced and shouted i'll tell you what you would have thought of you would have thought he was out of line but i'll tell you what he was a redeemed son who knew he was not going to be a son he was already a son and the reality of who he was struck the depths of his soul and produced a reaction oh god strike us tonight until the holy ghost amen takes control the meaning but then i think we got to be careful we got to be scriptural thank you for bringing that point up because the prophet said jesus is very scriptural and that jesus in me loves the jesus in you and the jesus in me still believes in worship and if it's the original jesus that jesus and you will too over there and you've got to be careful because paul said there was another jesus another spirit of the gospel i know that but at the same time a prophet said let any man that let any angel that come from heaven and preach anything different let him be accursed and the prophet said have you peace in your heart and the assurance he says a scriptural assurance as these people i've talked about tonight that when you met god anybody in here met god when you met god he said you had a spiritual a scripture rather experience that god changed your life completely and now not you're just the same person just rebuilding polished over but you are a new creature a new creation in christ do you know why these people are shouting is because they've got a scriptural assurance that they met the god of the bible and he produced them a change then what does a scriptural experience do it produces a scriptural assurance then the prophet said what's it going to take in the last days to stand brother darren he says it's going to take a scriptural trained church to stand in the last days may i announce to hell that grace tabernacle is a scriptural trained church that is not on their knees that it's not on their back and it's not hiding in the corner somewhere they are standing brother being on their feet now brother andrew what are you saying i'm saying what we need tonight is a renewing of our experience what does the word experience mean it means a practical contact with an observation of facts or events it is an event or it is an occurrence that leaves an impression on someone to encounter or undergo an event or an occurrence encourage to feel an emotion now when you begin to say this about needing an experience that'll i know that old devil raises his head and said well glory to god brother branham said we need to do away with experience i want to attack that devil to the wall too because the prophet said i'm hungry to see a church stand in the last days he says he says the little grin the little remnants are waiting on waiting to see how big we can make our denominations they're not waiting to see how well we can dress how big a church we can build they're waiting to see us manifest the life of the lord jesus christ in love and power now here's brother branham's words they've got an experience if there is a reality that's what we need is an experience now when he says this he goes to acts 19 and says have you received the holy ghost since you believed see in other words the holy spirit is a promise in every age there is not one aid somebody say one age where the spirit is not mentioned from ephesus to laodicea the spirit is mentioned in every age see the bible says heathen f and ear let him hear what the spirit said to the churches in other words the ability to hear what the spirit speaks is a god-given ability matthew says it this way or jesus rather in the book of matthew he says blessed art thou amen simon barjona for flesh and blood has not revealed it unto thee but my father which is in heaven he says now putting this verse together it's going to be to a very special group a group that receives the revelation of god in the age they're living in then they are the ones who have the spirit of god brother tim they are the ones that are born of god they are baptized into the body of jesus christ by his spirit they are baptized with the holy ghost are you ready for this the all of god are the children of god oh he says then the evidence of being a true child of god is again set forth as taught by the word by the holy ghost so tongue is just not the evidence amen but the evidence is the ability to hear what the spirit says he said i want to make myself very clear on what the baptism of the holy ghost is according to the word he says now what do we got to do we got to prove all things by what by the word how many knows the word corrects the error i'm driving this home the word corrects the error then what is the error the error was you receive the holy ghost when you believe but a prophet come with the word and said you receive the holy ghost since you believed amen then what is caused the misunderstanding amen the answer is experience we have gone by experience and not the word he says away with experience as your measure line there is only one plumb line only one word or rod and that is the word he says now watch amen they did not go on and receive the holy ghost he said you believe unto receiving the spirit believing on jesus it's a step in the right direction i'm i'm laying some word here on purpose which is toward the holy ghost but the people stop there they go as far as the water and stop they believe and then stop but the bible does not say when you when you believe it is have you received since you believed the exact and literal translation is did ye have previously believed receive the holy ghost the people believe and then stop you don't receive the holy ghost when you believe unto him have it repented you go on and receive the holy ghost do you see it what is wrong with our fundamentalists here it is they have stopped they have no power for they stop short of pentecost amen what is pentecost for the job it is an experience amen they stop short of a true experience with the true god amen brother branham was not saying we don't need experience he was saying we need amen in witnesses 1954 we need a word experience do you know why we need a word experience amen because heavens and earth shall pass away brother vernon but the word says amen my word shall never pass away that's why the devil wants you just to go and get a feeling because of feeling i'm preaching to you now because a feeling will pass away a sensation will pass away amen but the word amen will never pass away then what is the word amen the word is not just in print tonight amen the word has become flesh again oh can i preach to you for a minute the word has become flesh again listen this bible i got to drive this home amen three bibles one in the zodiac one in the pyramids one on paper amen the zodiac has been through solar systems but it's still testifying that the word is true the pyramids have been through the flood and it's still testifying the word is true come on now let's bring it on home and knock that devil clean out of black rock arkansas and this bible was laying on a pulpit in jeffersonville indiana and a flood struck the city but the word floated above the flood as a testimony that the word can never be destroyed [Applause] that as you feed on the word you become the word man told me one time he said andrew i think we're doing way too much reading of quotes he said what we need to do is read our bibles because that's the only thing that's been proven to go through the fire and flood and still survive i said well that's your opinion but here's what i believe brother mark i left there and i went down to keith brown's church and i went in there and brother keisha andrew i want to show you something he said go pick up one of them books it was a spoken word book he said rake your finger across the top of it i did amen and there was black soot on my finger i said where's these books been he said with andrew in my mobile home when my mobile home called on fire it burned to the ground he said but then books was stood the fire and he said i went over there and picked them up they were not damaged they were not burnt he said they just got a little soot on them i said thank you brother where's that oh intellectual devil at now amen let me say this amen if they destroy our books tomorrow amen let me say this if they destroy our tapes amen the word has already become flesh in blackrock arkansas young men the word is already to come flesh in you and there's not enough in your past there's not enough in your present and there's not enough in your future amen to destroy where god is leading you i gotta close what are you saying i'm saying slap somebody on the knee and say the word is going to be the word is going to be made flesh in a group of people in the state of arkansas in the place of blackrock because there's still some people that believe god and are living right this day this scripture is fulfilled brother branham this message ain't dead it's alive in arkansas tonight i'm looking at people that's been through hell but they're still standing i'm looking at young people that's fought all kinds of demons but they're still standing go ahead and say boo therefore that devil says he's going to get you he should have got you because you're done past getting no you didn't hear that you're done past getting the devil can't get you sin can't get you depression can't get you suicide can't get you katie's temptations can't get you because the word has become flesh by experience that's why you're still standing because the word is made flesh in a man named matt morris the word is made flesh in a young man you know why because you meant more than a theory you read more than a book you experienced christ you had a word experience let me let me close by saying this satan we are expected to receive you know what that word receive means it means to lay hold brother pruitt it means to get a hold of something come on it means brother wayne to put your hands on it and to claim it come on it means to lay hold on it it means to possess something you realize amen in acts 3 there was a man who was lame the prophet god said if you come with a kind now listen he said if you come with a kind of a sarcastic criticism whatever you expect to see that's just what you'll see hear me now if you come expect him to be just disappointed that's the way you're going to be he said but if you come to receive oh i feel like dancing because i feel like i'm in other company that come to receive anybody say i didn't come to criticize i didn't come to be disappointed i come to receive if you come to receive you will be expecting to receive are you ready for this and you shall receive just what you expect to receive well brother andrew i'm expecting to get the holy ghost amen ye shall receive the holy ghost brother andrew i'm expecting the baptism of a word birth and you shall receive listen if it's in the word it's for you tonight is there anybody who says i'm not leaving here without getting what i come to get from god brother i may have to fight you're exactly right amen but fight on amen because we're living oh god we're living in a time where god is doing great things now now we are living in unexpected times i mean let me give you a key and i'm watching my time let me give you a key to these meetings as you enter these meetings enter them under the expectation of god and not of man because a man is a human and he can fail you but my god brother philip my god has got a record he has never failed one time that's why david said my soul is expecting from him david said i once was young but now i'm old but i've never seen the righteous forsaken he said god if you give me the line and you give me the bear then you'll give me this uncircumcised ballistic are you hear me now amen i'm talking about a man who walked through the valley of the shadow of death but he would fear no evil because his expectation was of god that word expectation means a strong belief a strong belief that something will happen or be the case a belief that someone will or should achieve something the prophet said it was revealed in the simian by the holy ghost he says he had an attitude of expectation he said simeon had faith and faith knows no defeat faith is perfect i'm just laying some bricks in here to build on this meeting amen faith brings things when there is no things to be brought no you all didn't hear that that'll strike you about lunch tomorrow and you'll scare every one of your co-workers to death faith brings things when there is no things to be brought faith creates amen faith takes doubts away it takes the negative and makes it positive then faith must have a resting place that's why the bible says amen with god nothing shall be impossible you say brother andrew that's god he said well look at matthew 17 when there come a father this child that had epilepsy he said oh lord i've been to your disciples they could do nothing you say all things are possible with god all things are possible to you because god's power to perform the impossible is already in you now jesus said in the word if you ask somebody say ask the father anything in my name i'll do it but sometimes when god performs something and does something that we ask for it comes in an unexpected way and sometimes in an unexpected place and at an unexpected time it was unexpected when you met but god was expecting it come on i'm preaching this church now and i'm going i'm gonna close it was a barn in a field in arkansas didn't have a pulpit didn't have a platform didn't have sound boards didn't have sunday school rooms didn't have a nursery it was an unexpected place but it does not matter when the god of unexpected things is only inside of his believers brother matt when you baptized the first soul that might have been unexpected to the world but god was expecting it when you preached the first sermon it might have been unexpected to the world but god was expecting it come on church i'm preaching to you now when the devil said this is just a barn it'll never be nothing else amen but god rich in mercy amen said but i've got some seeds that are expecting amen something for me and i'll raise up a pla the prophet calls it a spot of grace and what's the name of this church it's a spot of grace and let me say this grace tabernacle in this meeting this weekend don't you hang your head don't you bow that head of that devil amen you stand there and say if my god did it before he's going to do it again when you hit the first bump you didn't close your bible and quit you kept on plowing come on church you kept on pushing you kept on amen men of god come in here and they kept on preaching and they kept on pushing and they kept on plowing and you kept on praying and you kept on coming and you kept on sacrificing and you kept on believing in the face of impossibility but let me announce to you tonight it's time to come together and look at what the lord has done come on church is that the best place we can give him i'm talking about the god that made a way when there was no way i'm talking about the god when you didn't know where to take your family he raised up a place i'm talking about a god when the odds was against you it did not matter brother wayne because god was on your side come on church it's time to rejoice i'm done tonight it's time to rejoice i'm going to say this you say that are you being pentecostal no i'm doing what revelation 10 8 says thou must prophesy again i'm going to prophesy according to the word you're going to see more miracles you're going to see more salvations you're going to see more prodigals return home you're going to see more miracles you're going to see more deliverances because right here in the state of arkansas the traits of god is still alive in a group of people brother andrew i don't like you bragging on this church so much i'm not bragging on a man i'm bragging on what god has done man can't do this with a man this was impossible but with god nothing is impossible come on young people i said with god nothing is impossible young man with you nothing is impossible salem with you nothing is impossible how can you say that because the same god that was in simian that led him under expectation to receive the fulfillment of the promise is the same god in you [Applause] let the musicians come this evening expecting of god expecting of god and i'm going to ask you to do something tonight i'm going to ask you to take the limits off of god take the limits on for this meeting lander you better be careful i'm going to tell you what the prophet said if you can limit god then you can limit christ and if you oh god if you limit the church today in its possibilities then you're limited god to say grace tabernacle can't do it can i preach to you it's to say god can't do it to say this bride can't do it it's to say god cannot do it [Music] because it's not a human doing it it's god on the inside of the individual the unchangeable god will give you the holy ghost he will give you the same holy ghost that he gave them there without a change he will do the same things that he did when he was here on earth to any man oh god or a woman that'll believe it and accept it if you've got the holy ghost then take a hold of it like jacob did and hold on to it until positive results come and at an unexpected time maybe at an unexpected place but he will do it in an unexpected place now here it is then how much more should he do it tonight in an expected place where we're expecting to see it happen we're not in an unexpected time we're not in an unexpected place [Applause] two years ago this was an unexpected place but tonight this is an expected place there's a group of people expected [Music] brother andrew is it possible the first night of our meeting at our spring meeting this year a woman was sitting with her family sister tara rachel is that correct was sitting with her family at a cracker barrel and something come over to say remember we get what we expect and she looked at everybody around her brother david and she said we get what we expect so they come to meeting she said what are you expecting what do you expected she had been battling a back trouble for about two years or something a while been all kinds of doctors nothing was helping her but while the word was being preached on the first night of a meeting i didn't know what was taking place i don't need to know what's taking place because the god of the impossible was in the building and the back trouble left that woman in the meeting there was a woman there carrying a fear had been in a car wreck 20 30 years ago carrying a fear and while the word was being preached the fear left her i didn't know what was happening amen i don't need to know what's happening if we just start preaching the word in the unseen realm things are taking place brother david things are happening right now you know why because there's a group of people expecting it there's a group of people expecting it now let me just go and tell you something tonight what you expect and what you say god hears [Music] brother darren god hears what we say he knows our thoughts a few years ago i was out brother mike walls it was a way to testify for just a moment preaching a youth camp out there for the wait on that friday night a storm hit the power went out it went totally back in there and i was preaching brother joel when that happened it was like somebody it was like somebody set something on fire the place erupted vernon they were jumping chairs were fi people were screaming i mean hauling and rejoicing praising god well brother the power just went out because if there's no power there's going to be no microphone i thought well that microphone still got power so i picked it up and i started preaching again and when i did that praise went into another level brother david i left that meeting and for three years i've wondered what caused that we didn't stage that what caused the how could the power go out and the meeting go to another level well this year i was over there and the brother picked me up on a golf cart and he said well andrew i need to i need to thank you for something i figured he was going to say thank you for coming and i said well thank you for having us it's been good to be here he said no does the name sound familiar i said no brother i'm sorry i don't know that name he said well that girl's my daughter he said she was here in that friday night meeting he said do you remember when the storm hit and the power went out i said yes sir i said i've wondered what happened he said my daughter was sitting there running from god and she was saying god i don't think you're real i don't think you're real she said god if you're real show me a sign you're real and if not would you please shut this preacher up i'm tired of hearing him [Music] she no more than said that and the power went out and you know what she said with the mark she said there it is he can't preach no more but when i picked up that microphone and begin to declare god is god and his word is true and the devil is defeated and the power of god is among us that girl surrendered her heart to jesus christ and she was in that meeting a few weeks ago what are you saying i'm saying come on church let's take the limits off of god this weekend he still does the miraculous he still does the impossible [Applause] he still breaks through when it looks like nothing can break through by the way he still breaks the when it looks like the unmovable can never move it still moves when it looks like the unbreakable will never break it still breaks you know why because he's still god and there's still some people in arkansas that still believes he's god let's raise our hands strength tonight as with our hearts how many believes here tonight [Music] he still moves [Music] he still destroys complexes [Music] yeah you've been listening them voices is trying to lead you away from the truth but the true word is still going forth he's still god [Music] hear these words as we bow our heart tonight i'm expecting god to heal he says at least 60 or 80 percent of people here tonight that will perfectly be well before this service is over [Music] and i'm expecting you to not father to move upon the hearts of them people and let them see the divine program oh i'm expecting god's glory to fall i'm expecting it to be such a spontaneous clap of faith here that'll send literally thousands of these peoples here into a sphere there where they could touch the hem of this garment and be made whole an expectancy what do we want to not church we're wanting an expectancy that brings unity the prophet said lord i'm just believing that you're going to pour your blessings i'm expecting it now all things are moving right in i'm expecting exceeded abundantly amen that's expected with the unity among the people the blessing for god for something they did not even have they had it in seed form the promise of the father oh but they were standing there he says and all of a sudden the atmosphere got right and old brother god sent an atmosphere and they got into one accord and they let the power surge down and it fulfilled the promises of god in their lives that same god friends that same god is right here in this building tonight we invite him to you pew heavenly father lord as i was sitting the other day and i heard your prophet stand and

few years here what you was expecting ever healing to manifest in every party you was expecting every deliverance to take place in every young person's life that's received one here lord you is expecting you knew it was going to happen that there was going to be young people raised up in this church that would not meet a theory it would not meet a picture they would not meet a dogma or a creed but they would they would have a man of god who would stand behind this pulpit and endeavor to lift up this message which is christ and there would be young boys and young girls and families that would come in contact with the god of this message with christ himself and it would produce a spiritual relationship you knew that was going to happen father i could stand here for the next hour and rehearse all the things that you've done in this church but lord what great pleasure it gives me to stand before this congregation tonight and say now if you was expecting him to do it in an unexpected time in an unexpected place then what about expecting god this weekend to do it in an expected time at an expected place father i pray right now in the name of jesus christ on the first night of this meeting may every heart come into one of mine may every heart come into one accord may every spirit come into one spirit the holy ghost satan i bind you you speak spirit of division you

house father may you fill every vessel lord may you renew expectations lord maybe somebody's been sitting on these pews for a few years believing god was going to do something and it hadn't happened

together and worship lord what a spirit of unity when the bride of christ comes together i appreciate all these the local churches it's been a support to our meetings and over the years and it's going on almost three years since we started the church here and where the morgan will tell you a little story if you'd catch him in the back and we actually had church in the kitchen we didn't even know his church we just come to pray asking god i knew that there was souls to be won i remember i was over in india and i just felt like sharing i felt i should share this but i was over in india praying and i'd been doing missionary work and when i'd come home and we'd talk about all the churches that we started in india everybody would rejoice and come home tell everybody the testimony there was ten churches started while we was in india and everybody would rejoice that's they'd spend money and spend efforts to send people over and and support them and i thought man what a wonderful thing that is and i kept going i kept preaching i was over praying one day and i remember the very prayer i said lord where will i go next and as as much as god has ever spoke to me he said what about where you live and it brought me back to a quote when brother brown said that the greatest mission field that we have most needed place for missionaries in the united states of america because i think we need this message preached on every street corner and if there's a place that rolls up on the other street corner let me be able to say i could be a proud supporter let me support this message friend i

all the brothers again being here and tonight what a tremendous atmosphere and when the presence of the lord comes by i often thought what a paradox it is that god is omnipresent but you can still call him on the scene it means he still knows he's if he's unchanging he's all knowing he still knows everything we're going through and you can still call him on the scene he already knew it brother
