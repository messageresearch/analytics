[1:16:51] amen i thank god for his grace
[1:16:54] amen i'm reminded what brother brown
[1:16:55] said there in perfect faith he said i
[1:16:57] was nothing when he found me he said i'm
[1:16:59] still nothing but i'm in his hands
[1:17:02] amen and i tell you it just shows the
[1:17:04] love of god and the prophet said and
[1:17:06] wouldn't our love reach back to him
[1:17:09] amen to realize that if he could love us
[1:17:11] when we were unlovable wouldn't our love
[1:17:13] reach back to him amen and i just love
[1:17:16] the lord tonight romans 11 verse 33
[1:17:22] the bible says all the depth
[1:17:24] of the riches
[1:17:26] both of the wisdom and knowledge of god
[1:17:29] how unsearchable are his judgments and
[1:17:32] his ways past finding out for who hath
[1:17:35] known the mind of the lord
[1:17:37] or who hath been his counselor
[1:17:40] or who hath first given to him and it
[1:17:42] shall be recompensed unto him again
[1:17:45] for of him
[1:17:46] and through him
[1:17:48] and to him
[1:17:49] are all things to whom be glory forever
[1:17:53] amen and when god had his blessings you
[1:17:56] can have your seats tonight
[1:18:07] i'd like to
[1:18:08] take from
[1:18:10] from that portion of scripture tonight
[1:18:12] and
[1:18:13] and just speak to you for the next few
[1:18:15] minutes on
[1:18:16] divine intelligence
[1:18:18] and i believe that
[1:18:20] there's an intelligence
[1:18:22] behind everything that we see and you
[1:18:25] know i know that you know today they try
[1:18:27] to tell us that
[1:18:28] you know that this world just come to be
[1:18:30] you know it just it just kind of
[1:18:31] happened
[1:18:32] but but i i personally believe that
[1:18:34] there was an intelligence behind it and
[1:18:36] it was it was a god that had to have the
[1:18:39] power to create a world and
[1:18:41] and i i believe that it was an
[1:18:43] intelligent design and even we are here
[1:18:46] you know and the prophet the prophet of
[1:18:48] god said and i hope it's all right if i
[1:18:49] quote a prophet if it ain't all right
[1:18:51] i'm gonna do it anyway but amen but i
[1:18:54] just can't help it amen but you know the
[1:18:56] prophet said he said when i look at a
[1:18:58] tree he said i see a tree how pretty it
[1:19:01] is i see it as it goes down another one
[1:19:04] comes up in his place perpetual life and
[1:19:06] i think of that but somewhere that tree
[1:19:08] had a beginning see it had to have a
[1:19:11] beginning the only way it could be
[1:19:12] designated to be a tree or to be an oak
[1:19:15] or a beech tree or popular or a palm or
[1:19:17] or whatever it was there had to be a
[1:19:20] master intelligence behind it see some
[1:19:23] great master intelligence had to set it
[1:19:25] in order he said oh blessed be his name
[1:19:27] he's the one who sets the moon and the
[1:19:29] stars in the solar system he said
[1:19:31] everything in his order and he'll set
[1:19:34] the church in order
[1:19:35] amen there in the church age book just
[1:19:37] to lay a foundation the prophet said let
[1:19:40] me inject this thought in here even your
[1:19:42] natural birth is based upon election
[1:19:45] amen the female ovaries produce many
[1:19:47] many eggs but why is it that a certain
[1:19:49] at a certain time a certain egg comes
[1:19:52] down and not another one or amongst all
[1:19:53] the male sperm for no known reason a
[1:19:56] certain germ attaches itself to that egg
[1:19:59] while others could have just as easily
[1:20:01] attached themselves or had a better
[1:20:03] opportunity to do so
[1:20:05] but but did not and perish
[1:20:08] see there's an intelligence behind all
[1:20:10] this
[1:20:11] otherwise what determines whether the
[1:20:13] baby is going to be a boy or a girl or
[1:20:15] blonde or brunette or light or dark or
[1:20:18] what color of eyes it's going to have
[1:20:19] how tall it's going to be and you know i
[1:20:22] i know this bunch out here today was
[1:20:24] would like to tell us that that's your
[1:20:25] choice you know whether you're a boy or
[1:20:28] a girl you can make your own mind up
[1:20:29] about that but but i'm one that believes
[1:20:32] that that choice has already been made
[1:20:34] even that decision has already been made
[1:20:37] and it wasn't you making the choice your
[1:20:39] parents didn't even make the choice amen
[1:20:41] but there is an intelligence behind that
[1:20:44] amen and so i believe that as the
[1:20:47] prophet would call it a master
[1:20:48] intelligence and i i believe it's a
[1:20:50] divine intelligence amen and so
[1:20:53] with that in mind i i thought about
[1:20:56] those four living creatures they're in
[1:20:58] revelations 4 and you see them in
[1:20:59] revelations 5 and the bible speaks of
[1:21:01] how that they had eyes before and behind
[1:21:04] and within amen and so the the bible
[1:21:07] says they were full of eyes amen and
[1:21:09] brother branham said it spoke of their
[1:21:11] intelligence he said the eyes spoke of
[1:21:14] their intelligence he said because you
[1:21:16] notice he said they they had eyes behind
[1:21:19] so that they could see what was in the
[1:21:21] past
[1:21:22] they had eyes within so they knew what
[1:21:24] was right now in the present and they
[1:21:26] had eyes before that they could see into
[1:21:29] the future he said showing that they can
[1:21:31] see what was what is and what is to come
[1:21:35] he said it was a reflection of him who
[1:21:38] was and is to come amen he said through
[1:21:41] the ages showing jesus christ again
[1:21:44] being the same yesterday today and
[1:21:46] forever
[1:21:47] amen because we know that those four
[1:21:49] living creatures were a representation
[1:21:51] amen of an anointing that would be upon
[1:21:54] the church through the church ages amen
[1:21:56] but i thought it was amazing that the
[1:21:58] prophet would say that those eyes amen
[1:22:00] would represent the intelligence and and
[1:22:03] how that that intelligence amen could
[1:22:06] see not only what was in the past and
[1:22:08] not only what was in the present but
[1:22:10] actually could see what was in the
[1:22:12] future amen and we know that there's
[1:22:15] only one intelligence or amen i believe
[1:22:18] that there's only one intelligence amen
[1:22:20] that knows the end from the beginning
[1:22:23] even there is only one isaiah 42 and
[1:22:26] verse 8 amen the bible says i am the
[1:22:28] lord that is my name and my glory will i
[1:22:31] not give to another neither my praise to

[1:23:07] they may try to predict things in the
[1:23:09] future amen but they cannot foretell the
[1:23:11] future amen because they are limited in
[1:23:13] knowledge even but god don't have to
[1:23:15] wait until it happens to tell you about
[1:23:18] it because he's omniscient and he knows
[1:23:21] all things

[1:23:56] a church we can point you to there ain't
[1:23:58] a
[1:23:59] government we can point you to there is
[1:24:01] only one place that we can point you

[1:24:41] he said i am god
[1:24:43] and there is none other
[1:24:45] amen notice in verse 10 they are
[1:24:47] declaring the end from the beginning
[1:24:50] amen from the ancient times even the
[1:24:52] things that are not yet done saying my
[1:24:54] counsel shall stand and i will do all of
[1:24:58] my pleasure
[1:24:59] amen that's god
[1:25:01] amen that's the mind of god
[1:25:03] even god is infinite amen he is he is
[1:25:06] not god is not a man that he should lie
[1:25:09] amen and the mind of god goes so far
[1:25:11] beyond
[1:25:12] even the the the mind of a man the
[1:25:15] thoughts of god amen is not that the
[1:25:17] scripture that his ways are higher than
[1:25:20] eyes
[1:25:21] amen amen his thoughts are so much
[1:25:23] higher than ours
[1:25:25] amen and and the prophet said amen he
[1:25:28] said you remember this is an easter seal
[1:25:30] 1965 he said you remember even the
[1:25:33] stature that you are in this morning
[1:25:35] amen if you wasn't in his thinking then
[1:25:38] then you're not now
[1:25:39] for you are there there's some part
[1:25:42] that's in you that's eternal
[1:25:46] amen and eternal only belongs to god
[1:25:50] and in god was his thinking of you
[1:25:53] sitting right where you are now
[1:25:57] amen in his thinking he said i stood at
[1:26:00] the pulpit because he's infinite and he
[1:26:03] knows all things and therefore he could
[1:26:05] tell the end from the beginning because
[1:26:07] he is eternal and you being a son of god
[1:26:11] or a daughter of god then you were in
[1:26:14] his thinking in the beginning
[1:26:19] super sign
[1:26:20] he said god knowed the end from the
[1:26:22] beginning
[1:26:23] and therefore he could plan everything
[1:26:26] god know the end from the beginning so
[1:26:29] therefore he could plan everything
[1:26:32] i want you to understand something
[1:26:34] tonight god has not been caught by
[1:26:36] surprise
[1:26:39] there ain't one circumstance in your
[1:26:41] life that took him by surprise
[1:26:44] there ain't nothing happening on the
[1:26:46] earth today that he didn't know about
[1:26:50] why i've said it many times in my church
[1:26:52] i said listen to me god is not up in
[1:26:54] heaven tonight chewing on his
[1:26:56] fingernails having a nervous breakdown
[1:26:58] because of the condition of this world
[1:27:02] amen he knew it would be this way
[1:27:06] and he's already made plans for it
[1:27:11] hallelujah
[1:27:13] even god knew that the world would be in
[1:27:15] this condition amen in the end time
[1:27:18] amen and he's already made a way of
[1:27:21] escape
[1:27:24] for them that will believe
[1:27:26] now watch as the prophet says see
[1:27:29] he said he knew the beginning from the
[1:27:31] end so therefore he could plan
[1:27:32] everything and that it would work out
[1:27:34] just to his glory
[1:27:36] that just gives us courage
[1:27:38] to know that no matter what comes or
[1:27:40] what goes god is working everything see
[1:27:44] the clock is ticking just exactly on
[1:27:47] time
[1:27:48] amen the world has fallen apart brother
[1:27:50] brown said god has an expectation
[1:27:55] i i thought about that and i thought man
[1:27:57] you know a lot of times we preach a lot
[1:27:58] about our expectation
[1:28:01] amen brother brown said god has an
[1:28:02] expectation
[1:28:04] and he said amen the reason why is
[1:28:06] because he knows what's going to happen
[1:28:10] amen now you might have come to church
[1:28:12] tonight hoping
[1:28:14] amen that you was gonna get a touch or
[1:28:16] you know hope and just pray and say oh
[1:28:18] god amen you know but god's expectation
[1:28:21] of this service
[1:28:23] will not amen amen he's not hoping it's
[1:28:26] gonna turn out that way he already knows
[1:28:28] how it's going to turn out
[1:28:30] and he knew every person that would be
[1:28:32] here
[1:28:33] and he knew all the people that wouldn't
[1:28:34] be here
[1:28:36] amen and yet he ain't worried about it
[1:28:40] amen you know i had to remind myself a
[1:28:41] lot
[1:28:42] about that a lot as a pastor because
[1:28:44] amen i get so worried about the people
[1:28:46] that ain't at church sometimes i forget
[1:28:48] about the ones that come
[1:28:50] amen and and you got to realize god
[1:28:52] already knew they wasn't going to be
[1:28:54] there
[1:28:55] even but he knew you were going to be
[1:28:57] here
[1:28:57] [Applause]
[1:29:00] and he knew what was on your heart
[1:29:03] and he knew all the needs that you had
[1:29:07] so the prophet said he had an
[1:29:08] expectation he knows what's going to
[1:29:10] happen see because he's infinite so
[1:29:13] there's nothing going wrong
[1:29:15] man that's a that is a statement ain't
[1:29:18] it
[1:29:18] the problem there ain't nothing going
[1:29:20] wrong you say man i wonder if he could
[1:29:21] say that in 2021.
[1:29:24] amen well listen there was a lot of
[1:29:25] trouble when he said that there was
[1:29:26] things going up amen amen you understand
[1:29:29] i believe the problem is standing here
[1:29:30] tonight amen and say the same thing
[1:29:34] because i happen to believe that god is
[1:29:35] still in control
[1:29:40] in the in the in the circumstances of
[1:29:42] this world amen has not taken god off of
[1:29:45] his throne but can i just quote a
[1:29:48] prophet he is right now
[1:29:50] governing in the affairs of men
[1:29:53] god is on the throne even tonight right
[1:29:55] in the midst of all of our trouble right
[1:29:58] in the midst of the darkest hour of this
[1:29:59] world amen god is still in control
[1:30:08] man in the prophecy nothing is going
[1:30:10] wrong
[1:30:11] it's all going exactly right
[1:30:14] because he's infinite
[1:30:16] amen he can foretell the end from the
[1:30:18] beginning he's god don't you think
[1:30:20] satan's putting anything over on him
[1:30:23] oh no
[1:30:24] it's just all working out to display his
[1:30:28] attributes
[1:30:30] see how could god
[1:30:32] even a great infinite god who knowed
[1:30:34] everything
[1:30:35] and then let everything let these things
[1:30:37] happen
[1:30:38] the prophet said he's only doing that
[1:30:41] amen so that his attributes
[1:30:43] can be
[1:30:47] let expressed challenge you in this
[1:30:48] tonight every place in this bible where
[1:30:51] one of the redemptive names of jehovah
[1:30:53] was revealed
[1:30:55] it was in a time
[1:30:56] of distress
[1:30:59] it was in a time amen when people didn't
[1:31:01] know which way to turn and they didn't
[1:31:03] know what to do amen when he revealed
[1:31:05] himself amen as jehovah jireh even
[1:31:08] abraham was taking his son and laying
[1:31:11] him on an altar getting ready to take
[1:31:13] his life even but god comes down in that
[1:31:16] extreme circumstances amen and shows
[1:31:18] himself amen as a provider
[1:31:21] [Applause]
[1:31:25] trace it all through the scripture amen
[1:31:27] it was in the great hours of distress
[1:31:30] and times when amen when they had no
[1:31:32] other place to turn and there was no
[1:31:34] other hope that they had amen let me
[1:31:36] tell you some church i believe we're
[1:31:38] getting in the place right now amen
[1:31:40] we're going to have to trust god with
[1:31:41] everything within us amen because there
[1:31:44] ain't no other answer no other place and
[1:31:46] we can't trust the government i know i'm
[1:31:48] preaching the people that know this amen
[1:31:50] you can't put your trust in nothing amen
[1:31:52] but we have something to anchor our
[1:31:55] souls in
[1:31:56] and we have a place amen that we can
[1:31:58] turn in this hour amen and if there was
[1:32:01] ever a time for us to look away to jesus
[1:32:04] it's right here tonight because it's the
[1:32:07] only hope that we have
[1:32:12] hallelujah
[1:32:15] so god will allow certain circumstances
[1:32:17] and things that take place so that he
[1:32:19] can display
[1:32:22] amen how could god ever be known as a
[1:32:25] deliverer
[1:32:26] nobody was ever in bondage
[1:32:30] how could he ever be known as a as a
[1:32:32] savior if what nothing never lost
[1:32:35] how could he ever be a redeemer amen as
[1:32:37] brother uh david was preaching last
[1:32:40] night somebody amen had to fall amen for
[1:32:43] him to do that how could it be known as
[1:32:45] a healer unless somebody got sick
[1:32:50] so god allows these things
[1:32:52] amen and to bring out an attribute
[1:32:56] he meant to manifest his power
[1:32:58] even to show a man that no i don't care
[1:33:01] what how impossible it seems
[1:33:06] amen god is a god of impossibilities
[1:33:09] [Applause]
[1:33:10] he specializes in them kind of
[1:33:13] circumstances
[1:33:16] hallelujah
[1:33:17] amen you start looking at things the
[1:33:19] right way it make you get excited when
[1:33:21] everything's turned upside down
[1:33:25] oh church i'll tell you something
[1:33:26] tonight amen if we really start coming
[1:33:28] through this bible and reading about
[1:33:30] what god did yesterday
[1:33:34] and we're getting to realize that
[1:33:36] whatever he did then as brother david
[1:33:37] said last night was a prophecy of
[1:33:39] something he will do again
[1:33:41] and we see when they got their back up
[1:33:43] against the wall amen and when the
[1:33:45] children of israel come out of egypt and
[1:33:47] they were led to the red sea and the red
[1:33:49] sea was in front of them pharaoh's army
[1:33:51] behind them cliffs on both sides and
[1:33:53] there was nowhere to go that's when god
[1:33:55] stepped down and made a way
[1:33:58] where there was no way
[1:34:02] hallelujah can i say this tonight i
[1:34:04] believe we're getting in a place for a
[1:34:06] perfect opportunity for a god of
[1:34:09] miracles to step down out of heaven
[1:34:12] hallelujah and show his power
[1:34:17] and prove amen who he is
[1:34:23] you believe that tonight
[1:34:27] let me remind you brother brown when he
[1:34:28] took a text from the rapture he took it
[1:34:30] out of psalms 27 amen which was a time
[1:34:33] of trouble
[1:34:35] and he said here's a background for the
[1:34:37] rapture a time of trouble oh brother if
[1:34:40] there was ever a time of trouble we're
[1:34:42] living in it now
[1:34:43] and i want to encourage you church is
[1:34:46] only setting the scene for a change of
[1:34:48] act body
[1:34:50] we're getting ready to go home amen
[1:34:52] we're getting ready to leave here in
[1:34:54] victory
[1:35:02] god knew it and he planned it
[1:35:08] amen
[1:35:09] amen he knew it was going to happen and
[1:35:11] he made plans for
[1:35:12] it he knew the world was going to get in
[1:35:16] this condition
[1:35:18] so he met he he had a a prophet called
[1:35:21] malachi
[1:35:22] to speak some words
[1:35:26] hallelujah behold i send you
[1:35:32] elijah
[1:35:34] before the great and dreadful day of the
[1:35:36] lord and he shall turn the hearts of the
[1:35:39] children back to the faith of the
[1:35:41] fathers he knew that this world was
[1:35:44] going to get in religious chaos he knew
[1:35:47] a man that every denomination was going
[1:35:50] to twist the scripture amen and take
[1:35:52] creed over the word amen he knew it and
[1:35:55] he planned for it so he sent us a profit
[1:36:01] turn our hearts back to faith
[1:36:05] [Applause]
[1:36:13] your birth was pre-planned
[1:36:18] your parents might not have planned for
[1:36:19] it but god did
[1:36:26] every one of you
[1:36:27] your birth was pre-planned brother ben
[1:36:29] said
[1:36:30] did you know that you your beginning
[1:36:33] never originated just as a myth
[1:36:36] or a thought
[1:36:39] come on church they trying to teach our
[1:36:41] kids in schools they come from monkeys
[1:36:43] and stuff but even the prophet said
[1:36:45] amen listen
[1:36:47] you didn't come out of some myth
[1:36:51] not some theory
[1:36:53] amen it was by the by the pre-planned
[1:36:57] amen of almighty god
[1:37:01] he says
[1:37:04] he said god before the foundation of the
[1:37:05] world
[1:37:07] he knew you would be here
[1:37:11] therefore there is nothing
[1:37:13] out of catering
[1:37:17] now
[1:37:18] man is it's fine we we don't know all
[1:37:20] things
[1:37:22] see we're limited in our knowledge
[1:37:25] and so brother brown says in god's
[1:37:27] chosen place of worship he said see a
[1:37:29] great unchanging god cannot change man
[1:37:31] changes
[1:37:32] but see you can put your life upon
[1:37:34] anything that god ever said at any time
[1:37:36] because it's the truth
[1:37:38] amen is the truth because there's only
[1:37:39] one thing i have confidence in that's
[1:37:41] the bible because man's word will fail
[1:37:44] but god is supreme
[1:37:48] he said see this year i'll know more
[1:37:49] than i did last year and you should too
[1:37:52] each day see we're finite so we we gain
[1:37:54] knowledge
[1:37:56] but god is infinite he's evident and and
[1:37:58] being infinite he cannot gain knowledge
[1:38:01] he's perfect
[1:38:04] he's perfect to begin with
[1:38:06] his first thought
[1:38:08] was a perfect thought
[1:38:12] so he says
[1:38:14] therefore every decision
[1:38:17] is exactly right
[1:38:19] now see
[1:38:20] we we learn from our mistakes
[1:38:24] or sometimes you know most of the time
[1:38:26] some better than others
[1:38:28] i mean but we we we should you know
[1:38:30] learn from our mistakes you know god
[1:38:32] ain't never learned from a mistake
[1:38:35] because he never made a mistake
[1:38:39] so god didn't have to try something amen
[1:38:41] to figure out what didn't work
[1:38:44] before he found out what would work
[1:38:47] because he's infant he knows all things
[1:38:50] and so because you know we're we're
[1:38:52] finite we're limited in our knowledge
[1:38:55] i mean you know most most men look to
[1:38:57] the past
[1:38:59] to to try to gain
[1:39:01] uh an understanding of the present
[1:39:04] or to to actually because you know
[1:39:07] it's not a bad thing even you know
[1:39:09] patrick henry i believe made a statement
[1:39:10] he said the only way to judge the future
[1:39:12] is by the past
[1:39:14] and and and i believe it was wisdom
[1:39:16] because
[1:39:17] when when men begin to realize
[1:39:19] that you know history repeats itself
[1:39:24] and they can look back at the success or
[1:39:27] the failures of other men
[1:39:29] and they could see if this you know if
[1:39:32] this army that's just taking the
[1:39:33] military realms if this army did these
[1:39:35] certain things you know they they either
[1:39:38] won a battle or they lost about or they
[1:39:40] and they've studied even all through uh
[1:39:42] time you know they've studied history
[1:39:45] amen not just because they were
[1:39:46] interested in something that happened a
[1:39:48] hundred years ago but they were trying
[1:39:50] to even gain an understanding of how to
[1:39:53] prepare for the future by studying
[1:39:55] history
[1:39:57] you understand
[1:39:58] and i believe it's actually a good thing
[1:40:01] amen and that's why amen it's good for
[1:40:03] us to even look back at times to what
[1:40:05] god has done yesterday
[1:40:08] amen because we can see brother brown
[1:40:10] taught us that if we meet god
[1:40:13] on the same basis
[1:40:15] if we approach him the same way
[1:40:19] and god cannot change in his nature and
[1:40:23] his in his essence
[1:40:25] what he did for them
[1:40:28] he will have to do for you
[1:40:33] hallelujah let me just stop and preach
[1:40:35] right here for a minute amen because if
[1:40:37] you read over in acts 2 amen and you see
[1:40:40] there where somebody repented and was
[1:40:42] baptized in the name of lord jesus
[1:40:44] christ and they were filled with the
[1:40:45] holy ghost if god did that then
[1:40:49] hallelujah
[1:40:50] amen and if you do the same thing they
[1:40:52] did
[1:40:55] you have to get the same result that
[1:40:58] they got
[1:41:03] if somebody rose up in faith and so i'm
[1:41:05] gonna take god at his word and i'm gonna
[1:41:07] profess and claim that he is my healer
[1:41:10] in spite of how i feel in spite of what
[1:41:12] the circumstances are it's about what
[1:41:14] the doctor says and if somebody did that
[1:41:17] and god come down and heal their body
[1:41:20] amen he is no respecter of persons
[1:41:23] [Applause]
[1:41:30] i just want to say this
[1:41:32] me and look back to history
[1:41:35] to try to
[1:41:37] to predict the future to try to get an
[1:41:40] understanding of the present
[1:41:42] but god has no need of looking back
[1:41:46] god don't have to look back amen
[1:41:48] amen to what happened a thousand years
[1:41:50] ago to tell you what's going to happen
[1:41:52] tomorrow
[1:41:54] he already knows
[1:41:56] that's why this bible ain't just a
[1:41:58] history book there's a lot of history in
[1:42:00] the bible but it ain't a history book
[1:42:02] come on church this bible amen is a book
[1:42:04] of prophecy
[1:42:07] you believe that
[1:42:09] amen the prophet said amen 40 men wrote
[1:42:11] the bible over the space of 1600 years
[1:42:14] apart amen at different times predicting
[1:42:16] the most important events that ever
[1:42:17] happened in the world's history and many
[1:42:19] of them hundreds of years before they
[1:42:21] happen and there's not one era in the
[1:42:24] entire 66 books of the bible amen no
[1:42:27] author but god could write such a book
[1:42:33] let me tell you but one intelligence can
[1:42:35] write a book like this
[1:42:37] over the span of sixteen hundred years
[1:42:40] amen by forty different men which were
[1:42:42] scribes amen because there ain't 40
[1:42:43] authors of the bible there's only one
[1:42:45] but there was different scribes that
[1:42:47] wrote it amen but there's only one
[1:42:49] intelligence amen that could start a
[1:42:51] story amen 1600 years before and
[1:42:54] finishes 1600 years later and used 40
[1:42:57] different men to do it and many of them
[1:42:59] never met and they never consulted with
[1:43:01] one another and when it got finished it
[1:43:03] was one contradiction
[1:43:08] hallelujah
[1:43:09] and and people want to criticize it amen
[1:43:12] listen foreign amen this book has been
[1:43:14] criticized made fun of amen through to
[1:43:17] the side disregarded but i want to tell
[1:43:20] you what i believe i believe it's the
[1:43:22] infallible word of almighty god
[1:43:25] hallelujah it's not the book even uh of
[1:43:29] a better idea it's not crazy and ethics
[1:43:32] amen it's jesus christ in written form
[1:43:40] it's a book of prophecy
[1:43:44] amen god spoke wrote things in this
[1:43:46] bible that's happening right now
[1:43:50] over a thousand years ago
[1:43:57] amen think about that for a minute
[1:43:59] and i want to ask you a question how did
[1:44:01] moses
[1:44:02] write the old testament
[1:44:05] where did he get that information
[1:44:07] how do you know what happened in garden
[1:44:09] eden was he there
[1:44:10] come on i'm asking the question tonight
[1:44:12] how did he know amen what what adam said
[1:44:15] what eve said how do you know about all
[1:44:17] these how do you know about abraham how
[1:44:19] did he know he'd say well it was just
[1:44:21] passed down from generation to
[1:44:22] generation amen i don't believe that i
[1:44:25] believe what happened was amen as he met
[1:44:27] a pillar of fire
[1:44:28] [Music]
[1:44:31] brother brown said he got his
[1:44:33] information out that pillar of fire
[1:44:36] amen in other words what he wrote was
[1:44:39] coming from another intelligence
[1:44:42] [Applause]
[1:44:45] i might not have time but i'm going to
[1:44:47] stay here for a minute long enough to
[1:44:48] say this amen listen even a prophet amen
[1:44:52] it's not amen that god just comes down
[1:44:54] and inspires their thinking
[1:44:58] ain't like a preacher standing i pulled
[1:45:00] again under a little inspiration say a
[1:45:01] few things amen when a prophet speaks
[1:45:04] it didn't come out of his mind
[1:45:07] and god didn't inspire his thoughts
[1:45:10] he bypasses his thoughts
[1:45:14] and spoke his own words
[1:45:17] through their lips
[1:45:22] they didn't even know what they were
[1:45:23] saying brother brown said many of them
[1:45:26] if they would have knew what they were
[1:45:27] saying they would have never said it
[1:45:31] but it wasn't them that was saying it to
[1:45:33] start with
[1:45:36] there was another intelligence that was
[1:45:39] speaking through their lips
[1:45:43] hallelujah i'm just gonna go ahead and
[1:45:45] say it tonight and give the devil a good
[1:45:47] black eye this message we believe did
[1:45:49] not come out of the mind of a sixth
[1:45:51] grade kentucky boy amen no sir this was
[1:45:55] not the foster william brown this is not
[1:45:58] a man's message
[1:46:03] this is the mind of god
[1:46:06] spoke through the mouth of a
[1:46:10] prophet to give you
[1:46:13] rapturing faith
[1:46:14] [Applause]
[1:46:22] hallelujah
[1:46:24] oh you say you're too bold with that
[1:46:28] amen let me tell you something i'll
[1:46:29] scream it from the high smell i preach
[1:46:31] it till the day i die
[1:46:33] even dang i ain't gonna let no spirit
[1:46:35] out of hell come in and diminish and be
[1:46:38] little and take away and discredit what
[1:46:41] god has done in our day
[1:46:44] this ain't just another movement come on
[1:46:46] church this ain't just another healing
[1:46:49] revival
[1:46:50] this ain't another smith wigglesworth
[1:46:52] this is not just another man coming out
[1:46:55] amen with a gift in his life
[1:46:57] this is the word of almighty god
[1:47:04] to take us back
[1:47:06] to the original word
[1:47:08] [Music]
[1:47:09] [Applause]
[1:47:17] that's how moses knew what happened in
[1:47:19] the garden of eden
[1:47:23] it's what he was writing was coming
[1:47:25] right out of the mind of god
[1:47:28] and think about this moses wrote about
[1:47:30] things that had already happened
[1:47:32] he wrote about things that were
[1:47:33] happening then
[1:47:34] and he wrote about things that are to be
[1:47:39] amen and i say the same intelligence
[1:47:41] that told him about what had been
[1:47:43] shown him what was getting ready to come
[1:47:46] and amen the same intelligence that told
[1:47:48] him even and showed him what happened to
[1:47:50] the garden of eden even showed him
[1:47:53] prophecies that would come to pass
[1:47:56] thousands of years later
[1:48:05] this is dangerous because i ain't
[1:48:06] looking at no clocks or nothing and
[1:48:09] [Applause]
[1:48:14] i just want to ask you a question if
[1:48:16] if looking to the past
[1:48:19] can give you a great advantage
[1:48:22] in preparing for the future
[1:48:27] how much more of an advantage would you
[1:48:29] have
[1:48:31] if you could actually see the future
[1:48:36] come on church don't you realize that
[1:48:38] nations and armies and men have have
[1:48:40] spent billions of dollars and they have
[1:48:41] they have spent hours and uh uh you know
[1:48:44] given their lives to study and amen uh
[1:48:46] history amen so that they might be able
[1:48:49] to some way prepare and predict for the
[1:48:51] future
[1:48:53] amen and and in some cases it gives them
[1:48:56] a heavy advantage whether they're trying
[1:48:57] to have a business or they're trying to
[1:48:59] rule a nation or whatever they're doing
[1:49:01] it could give them a great advantage by
[1:49:03] knowing even what has been
[1:49:06] but if that could give you an advantage
[1:49:09] what if you could see what would
[1:49:11] [Applause]
[1:49:13] can i be you an example of that in the
[1:49:15] scripture amen there's a king down there
[1:49:17] in syria one day warren with israel
[1:49:20] amen and everywhere he would go amen the
[1:49:23] armies of israel was waiting on him
[1:49:26] and he got to thinking you know what hey
[1:49:28] somebody in our camp amen we got a mole
[1:49:30] in the camp we got somebody there's a
[1:49:32] spy in the camp
[1:49:34] amen there ain't no way that they know
[1:49:36] where we're going unless somebody's
[1:49:37] telling them
[1:49:38] they just that we're losing too many
[1:49:40] battles every time even they always got
[1:49:42] the up they're three steps in front of
[1:49:44] us all the time
[1:49:46] amen he got all this close uh men
[1:49:48] gathered them together and he said
[1:49:50] listen there's something wrong here
[1:49:51] somebody hey man say we gotta we gotta
[1:49:53] spy among us remember the days a man
[1:49:56] rose up and said no king he said oh but
[1:49:58] there's a prophet down there in israel
[1:50:00] [Applause]
[1:50:04] he tells the king of israel the things
[1:50:06] you speak in your bed chamber
[1:50:11] hallelujah amen and
[1:50:14] and the king didn't understand how in
[1:50:16] the world do they know where i'm going
[1:50:19] before i get there
[1:50:21] and he was so frustrated even but the
[1:50:23] man rose up and said the problem is is
[1:50:25] they got a connection with the almighty
[1:50:29] [Applause]
[1:50:31] they got a man in their camp
[1:50:34] that by the vision
[1:50:36] can see amen into the future
[1:50:38] and he knows where you're going before
[1:50:39] you get there oh church i want to tell
[1:50:42] you tonight you're frustrating to the
[1:50:44] devil
[1:50:47] and i believe the devil is wondering
[1:50:49] tonight why are you still here
[1:50:54] and why didn't all them tactics that
[1:50:55] worked with everybody else worked for
[1:50:57] you
[1:50:59] and it seemed like you knew what he was
[1:51:00] going to do before he ever done it
[1:51:04] amen let's let the devil in a little
[1:51:05] secret tonight amen we got a prophet in
[1:51:08] the land
[1:51:10] and our enemy has been exposed
[1:51:15] we know the tactics of the devil
[1:51:22] hallelujah
[1:51:25] brother brown said
[1:51:27] looking to the unseen
[1:51:28] he said somebody asked me not long ago
[1:51:30] said brother brown what do you think
[1:51:31] about the future i said i don't know
[1:51:33] i don't know what the future holds
[1:51:36] but i know who holds the future
[1:51:40] so that's the thing if i can just keep
[1:51:42] acquainted with him
[1:51:46] i don't have to know everything god
[1:51:48] knows
[1:51:49] what i got to do is stay acquainted with
[1:51:51] him
[1:51:53] come on church amen brother brown said
[1:51:55] god didn't even tell his prophets
[1:51:56] everything
[1:51:58] amen but they didn't need to know
[1:51:59] everything but we know enough
[1:52:04] that the one we're following
[1:52:07] has never failed us
[1:52:09] [Applause]
[1:52:11] and he has led us this far
[1:52:14] and he's kept us this far hallelujah and
[1:52:17] because of this i've got a great
[1:52:19] confidence to know that the god that
[1:52:21] i've followed this far has kept me all
[1:52:23] my life is going to lead me
[1:52:26] all the way
[1:52:32] hallelujah
[1:52:33] [Applause]
[1:52:40] let me just say this tonight
[1:52:42] because you know sometimes
[1:52:44] sometimes
[1:52:47] and this is a very true thing there
[1:52:48] ain't nothing you know about the past
[1:52:53] and we we get
[1:52:54] and this is the thought that we have and
[1:52:56] it's so true
[1:52:57] the only way to change the future
[1:52:59] is in the prison
[1:53:02] you understand
[1:53:04] but i want to just kind of give you this
[1:53:07] kind this idea
[1:53:09] that
[1:53:11] the future
[1:53:13] could actually change the prison
[1:53:18] see because
[1:53:20] i'm not here tonight
[1:53:23] trying to in the present
[1:53:25] change my future
[1:53:28] because i believe in predestination
[1:53:32] and i believe my future is clear
[1:53:36] but i believe many times if i could see
[1:53:38] the future
[1:53:40] it might change my presence
[1:53:42] you understand what i'm saying
[1:53:45] let me just give you an example of that
[1:53:46] but brother branham says amen and he's
[1:53:49] in discernment here i think this is so
[1:53:51] powerful
[1:53:52] y'all just bear with me a few minutes
[1:53:54] amen but i think this is so powerful
[1:53:56] because brother brown says he's talking
[1:53:58] to a lady and deserving he says do you
[1:54:00] believe he says do you believe that
[1:54:01] these things are taking place is from
[1:54:03] god the spirit of god do you lady he
[1:54:05] said then us being strangers to each
[1:54:07] other he said then if something would
[1:54:09] happen that i would would let me know
[1:54:11] something about you
[1:54:13] see if god could tell me what you have
[1:54:15] been
[1:54:16] surely he can tell me what you will be
[1:54:19] and if he knows the past then he knows
[1:54:21] the future
[1:54:22] and that makes it it proves that it is
[1:54:24] god
[1:54:27] another place
[1:54:28] he's in discernment again he says isn't
[1:54:30] he lovely sister
[1:54:31] he's the fairest of ten thousand he's a
[1:54:33] lily of the valleys he's a brat and
[1:54:35] morning star and i perceive it right now
[1:54:37] that you are a christian
[1:54:40] because your spirit begins to feel
[1:54:41] welcome see i know that somewhere
[1:54:43] standing near he's standing
[1:54:45] because your spirit and the holy spirit
[1:54:47] which is now on me is becoming in
[1:54:49] contact with each other see
[1:54:51] and now he can he can reveal to me and
[1:54:54] if he knows what your past has been
[1:54:56] amen and now you'll you're the judge of
[1:54:58] that now if he'll tell you what your
[1:55:01] future will be surely if he knows the
[1:55:03] past then he knows the future
[1:55:06] now if he would tell you the future
[1:55:07] before he told you the past
[1:55:10] see then you would wonder whether it was
[1:55:12] going to happen or not
[1:55:14] see but he if he tells you what you
[1:55:16] already know has happened
[1:55:20] then you know whether the future's going
[1:55:22] to be right
[1:55:23] see you see how he does it he makes it
[1:55:26] so real
[1:55:28] that there's no way out of it
[1:55:34] listen the next words out of his mouth
[1:55:35] amen now this audience can still hear my
[1:55:37] voice the woman seems to be moving away
[1:55:39] from me she's going back i see her she's
[1:55:42] standing in a building she's before a
[1:55:44] doctor and the doctor says she has a
[1:55:46] tumor the tumor is a thyroid tumor he
[1:55:49] says you must have an operation
[1:55:51] immediately frankly i see a shadow come
[1:55:53] over that that has been in the middle of
[1:55:55] last week you were uh to be operated on
[1:55:58] but the reason you didn't was you heard
[1:56:00] i was coming here amen and you wanted to
[1:56:02] come and wanted me to pray for you
[1:56:05] before that could take place that's this
[1:56:07] saith the lord
[1:56:15] and he told the woman something that she
[1:56:17] alone knew
[1:56:21] and she's standing there and she knows
[1:56:23] there's no way this man knew that i went
[1:56:25] to a doctor and them doctor said them
[1:56:28] words
[1:56:30] but a god that could tell me what a
[1:56:33] doctor told me two weeks ago
[1:56:36] if he tells me i'll be walking in the
[1:56:38] morning
[1:56:39] why would i ever doubt what that god
[1:56:42] said
[1:56:47] hallelujah can i pick up from there
[1:56:49] brother david from last night i mean a
[1:56:51] god that could tell me what happened in
[1:56:54] the garden of eden listen this message
[1:56:56] didn't come just to tell us we as a
[1:56:58] bunch of sinners
[1:57:00] it come to tell us why
[1:57:02] and what happened and the reason we were
[1:57:04] in that condition
[1:57:07] not to leave us there
[1:57:10] he told us where we were
[1:57:14] hallelujah but i'm glad that this
[1:57:16] intelligence didn't start in genesis 1.
[1:57:21] but way back in the back part of god's
[1:57:23] mind
[1:57:25] before the foundation of the world
[1:57:28] before there was a fall
[1:57:32] there were some sons of god
[1:57:34] that was shouting for joy
[1:57:39] hallelujah and i
[1:57:42] was there
[1:57:46] hallelujah you want to know why you're
[1:57:48] here amen in the word tonight this ain't
[1:57:50] the first time you amen this word
[1:57:53] this ain't the first time you shouted
[1:57:55] for joy this is the first time that you
[1:57:58] sung the praises of god
[1:58:00] before the foundational world in the
[1:58:03] mind of god the sons of god were shouted
[1:58:06] for joy
[1:58:09] and i was there
[1:58:13] that's my past
[1:58:14] but let me tell you about my future
[1:58:19] hallelujah
[1:58:20] because i was shouting then i'm shouting
[1:58:23] out
[1:58:24] but one of these days i'm going
[1:58:27] to a meeting in the air
[1:58:33] and if you think i act crazy now just
[1:58:35] wait till my change comes
[1:58:39] if you think this is noisy just wait
[1:58:41] till we get to the other side
[1:58:49] i love what the prophecy this ain't no
[1:58:51] new religion
[1:58:53] it's the oldest one there is
[1:58:57] hallelujah amen this ain't no new thing
[1:58:59] even somebody say well looks like
[1:59:01] there's a new movement coming around the
[1:59:02] message a bunch of excitement people are
[1:59:05] praising god and shouting no it ain't
[1:59:07] new amen we're just getting back
[1:59:10] to our roots
[1:59:12] we're getting back amen to what we were
[1:59:15] born to be
[1:59:26] hallelujah
[1:59:32] did not jesus do the same thing the
[1:59:33] woman at the whale
[1:59:36] what are you doing
[1:59:37] he told her
[1:59:39] about her past
[1:59:42] showed her future
[1:59:44] see and brother brown said it was the
[1:59:46] wisdom of god
[1:59:49] amen because god knows if he just made
[1:59:51] some statements about your future
[1:59:53] amen you'd be questioning
[1:59:55] so you really know what he's talking
[1:59:56] about
[1:59:58] but because he was so detailed
[2:00:01] and so accurate
[2:00:03] and telling you about things even that
[2:00:05] only you and him know
[2:00:06] and he told you all about come on for
[2:00:08] not to embarrass you
[2:00:11] come on jesus didn't come to that woman
[2:00:13] to embarrass her about the situation she
[2:00:15] was in he was igniting a seed of faith
[2:00:18] that was laying in her heart
[2:00:20] light was flashing across a
[2:00:23] predestinated seed
[2:00:30] what kind of intelligence knows these
[2:00:32] things
[2:00:33] listen
[2:00:34] brother brown says
[2:00:35] he's down there talking about infidel
[2:00:37] that time
[2:00:39] you know what you remember
[2:00:42] he got the man looked over it
[2:00:44] man it was weird brother i can't
[2:00:45] remember right now but
[2:00:47] he said
[2:00:48] you you're so sorry you got to hang out
[2:00:49] with the preacher and all that kind of
[2:00:50] stuff and the man didn't like preachers
[2:00:52] he was he's an infidel
[2:00:55] brother brown just started talking to
[2:00:56] him
[2:00:58] he didn't get his bible out and
[2:01:00] you know all that kind of so he just
[2:01:01] started talking to him and after a while

[2:05:28] and it went back and then it come to
[2:05:30] them pipes that let out that hatchery
[2:05:33] and that pipe was shut off because it

[2:05:57] and went right back into the very
[2:05:59] hatchery it was released out of and they
[2:06:01] found that catfish right back and
[2:06:03] impossible for it to get their nose all

[2:06:41] people amen amen this world amen every
[2:06:44] voice you hear is saying it can't be
[2:06:46] done you'll never make it you can't live
[2:06:49] that kind of life in this modern age but
[2:06:51] there is a power on the inside of you
[2:06:55] that cannot be explained
[2:06:57] there's an intelligence
[2:06:59] beyond man's intelligence that's leading
[2:07:02] you
[2:07:13] i figured my time's going but i ain't
[2:07:15] done it amen i'll tell you this they may

[2:08:03] year
[2:08:04] and they've never been there how they
[2:08:07] know to do that is their divine
[2:08:09] intelligence in them

[2:12:26] heart is he was he was thinking about
[2:12:29] his brother who was a
[2:12:32] church could you imagine this boy could
[2:12:34] not speak he could not stand he could
[2:12:37] not form a sentence he could not even

[2:13:03] thought comes through there he'll
[2:13:04] condemn you by and beat you down with it
[2:13:07] amen but i want you to know leave here
[2:13:09] tonight and the next time the devil puts
[2:13:11] something in your mind you say devil you

[2:13:15] my heart has been reserved for almighty
[2:13:18] god hallelujah amen and i might have
[2:13:21] thought about
[2:13:22] that i'm going to repent about it right
[2:13:24] now my heart belongs to jesus christ
[2:13:34] brother brown said that boy was singing
[2:13:35] about his brother who was a
[2:13:38] and he saw a vision he said he saw that
[2:13:40] boy riding a yellow goaters
[2:13:42] you want to find it in the message all
[2:13:44] you gotta do is put in y'all to go
[2:13:45] because you ain't gonna find many
[2:13:47] times brother brown said that but anyway
[2:13:49] he's riding some y'all go to her dog i
[2:13:51] believe he says he says he says now he
[2:13:54] says he begins to see that vision and
[2:13:55] that boy fell and was injured and he's
[2:13:57] walking on uh clubs or or crutches or
[2:14:00] whatever it was he said as he's saying
[2:14:02] that he said there's so many people
[2:14:04] there like nearly a city block but as
[2:14:06] he's saying that that boy somewhere in
[2:14:08] that in that audience amen all of a
[2:14:10] sudden here comes a man running
[2:14:14] leaping and jumping and praising god
[2:14:17] amen and as he gets down there close he
[2:14:18] said i'm that boy i'm that's me amen
[2:14:23] he was not walking on crutches
[2:14:29] and as all this is going on brother
[2:14:30] brown one place he said took him there
[2:14:32] in 30 minutes just to calm that boy down
[2:14:35] he said but then a vision broke
[2:14:38] he said and i saw the boy on the
[2:14:39] platform
[2:14:41] standing in front of me
[2:14:43] in his right mind
[2:14:45] he said then i knew
[2:14:47] it was over
[2:14:49] he looked into his past
[2:14:52] but then he looked into his future
[2:14:55] he said i began to speak to that boy
[2:14:58] he said but he could not understand what
[2:15:00] i was saying
[2:15:02] go back and listen to what brother brown
[2:15:03] said he said as i spoke to him through

[2:15:20] around his neck and brother brown said i

[2:15:40] in that boy's life because he was born
[2:15:42] in that condition he stood to his feet
[2:15:45] brother bill said in his right mind
[2:15:47] tears running down his face
[2:15:54] reminds me of what happened in acts 3

[2:16:13] his right hand amen and he lifted him to
[2:16:16] his feet until his ankle bones receive
[2:16:19] strength
[2:16:22] and that man

[2:20:11] whole story but i'm just telling you
[2:20:12] this everybody remembers this brother
[2:20:14] brown got so discouraged and such in a
[2:20:17] place because he said god seemed like
[2:20:18] the god wouldn't hear his prayer
[2:20:21] he said it was just silent no god you
[2:20:23] know just god wouldn't hear him
[2:20:25] and he says you know
[2:20:27] he says i was thinking
[2:20:30] he was thinking he even told his wife he

[2:20:35] know what brother brown even in one
[2:20:36] place i i i i'm just going off memory
[2:20:39] here but one place i believe brother
[2:20:40] brown talked about he said
[2:20:43] he said well
[2:20:44] you know he's thinking about the great
[2:20:45] meeting that he had in effort he said
[2:20:47] well he said you know on the essence of
[2:20:49] what he was thinking was i guess that'd
[2:20:51] be a good one a good meeting to end a
[2:20:53] ministry you know
[2:20:54] just such a god
[2:20:56] just overlooked all that and
[2:20:58] moved in such a miraculous way
[2:21:00] but he said he was he was pacing the
[2:21:03] floor one night
[2:21:04] middle of the night
[2:21:07] and he was thinking about his future
[2:21:12] and he was saying i guess i've come to
[2:21:13] the end
[2:21:14] [Music]

[2:21:20] he said all of a sudden
[2:21:21] that presence come in the room
[2:21:23] he said for a first time in a long time
[2:21:27] i knew he was there
[2:21:30] and he saw if i'm not mistaken a hand or
[2:21:32] something didn't come there was some
[2:21:34] papers brother brown described like
[2:21:36] typewriter papers he said that hand took
[2:21:38] and just
[2:21:39] threw him up he said
[2:21:41] it just began to stack up
[2:21:44] leading our way up into heaven
[2:21:46] and the voice spoken says and as you
[2:21:48] were thinking on your future
[2:21:52] brother brown says
[2:21:54] that's exactly right

[2:22:26] true
[2:22:27] and god's been silent brother brown said
[2:22:28] when god's silent devil does a lot of
[2:22:30] talking

[2:23:27] say
[2:23:28] i'm in that place
[2:23:29] [Music]
[2:23:30] seems like i went as far as i can go
[2:23:34] i don't know what else to do
[2:23:36] satan's taking advantage of you and he's
[2:23:38] taking advantage of the situation the
[2:23:40] circumstance everything going on in your
[2:23:41] life
[2:23:43] he's constantly putting you back to the
[2:23:45] past and everything he was
[2:23:47] and he's telling you all the troubles of
[2:23:48] today
[2:23:53] by the vision of god
[2:23:56] by a supernatural message it's been
[2:23:58] delivered to us for out of heaven
[2:24:02] [Music]
[2:24:03] you have been seen
[2:24:07] in a
[2:24:09] [Music]
[2:24:13] the vision of god
[2:24:15] saw the preview of the bride you know
[2:24:17] what he saw he saw the alpha church
[2:24:21] he saw the present church
[2:24:23] he said oh god is this all i can do
[2:24:27] but then god
[2:24:28] showed him
[2:24:30] another view
[2:24:33] the bride that would come
[2:24:37] i don't know about y'all but i believe i
[2:24:39] was in that group
[2:24:41] [Music]
[2:24:44] when he saw me he didn't see me falling
[2:24:46] off in the hell final witch
[2:24:49] he saw me walking up
[2:24:51] [Music]
[2:24:54] up church i know y'all might
[2:24:58] i probably all worry out there on a limb
[2:25:00] so far anyway but
[2:25:02] i just got to tell you what i believe i
[2:25:04] believe god allowed that prophet to step
[2:25:05] beyond the curtain of time he come back
[2:25:07] and told us what he saw and in that
[2:25:09] sixth dimension he saw a bunch of people
[2:25:11] millions of them as in fact
[2:25:13] amen and and when he when the voice
[2:25:15] spoke and he said well paul had to stand
[2:25:18] with his people
[2:25:19] he said yes he said praise god
[2:25:22] because i preached what paul preached
[2:25:24] [Music]
[2:25:27] and
[2:25:28] this might be crazy to you but i believe
[2:25:30] i screamed out
[2:25:32] said brother branham
[2:25:35] i'm resting on that
[2:25:40] church i might not feel like it tonight
[2:25:42] and you not might feel like it tonight

[3:03:14] there's liberty in the house of god i

[3:03:18] because my bible says where the spirit
[3:03:19] of the lord is there is liberty
[3:03:22] therefore when i see people that are

[3:03:25] but under the word and truth in the
[3:03:28] spirit
[3:03:29] in spirit and truth and it's a real

[3:03:36] really want to do they want to have
[3:03:37] liberty you really realize what liberty
[3:03:39] is tonight let me just enlighten you in
[3:03:41] case some of you didn't know liberty is
[3:03:43] whenever you are released from
[3:03:45] oppression that was put on you by a
[3:03:47] higher authority
[3:03:49] when somebody held you under bondage and
[3:03:51] higher authority and oppress you
[3:03:53] whenever you release from that there
[3:03:55] comes a liberty
[3:03:56] let me tell you friends the devil is an
[3:03:58] authority but the prophet of god said
[3:04:00] the only authority he had is the
[3:04:01] authority that you give him and i'm
[3:04:03] coming here tonight on a higher
[3:04:04] authority that the people of god have a
[3:04:07] right to have liberty in their worship
[3:04:10] i don't know how many people are there
[3:04:12] how many of you would kill me now

[3:04:26] being the greatest battle ever thought
[3:04:27] paul he said in the battle that's going
[3:04:29] on right here right now it's a battle
[3:04:31] between life and death between sickness
[3:04:34] and health between faith and doubt and
[3:04:36] it's a battle between liberty and
[3:04:38] bondage i'm telling you friends the
[3:04:40] devil ain't going to win this battle but
[3:04:41] i got a right to have liberty in the
[3:04:44] house of god and liberty in my life i
[3:04:46] say friends we ought to praise our god
