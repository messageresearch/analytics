[37:48] Lorden we you say it's good to be in the
[37:50] house of the Lord certainly a privilege
[37:54] just to be able to come and gather
[37:56] around the word of God and I just want
[37:58] to remember all of
[38:01] our young people and different ones that
[38:03] went to the meeting we got about half
[38:05] the church went to Tennessee this
[38:07] morning
[38:08] to the brother David's meeting so just
[38:11] want to pray for them traveling and on
[38:13] their way back and I also want to
[38:15] remember my mom asked for prayer this
[38:17] morning sick in her body and and I guess
[38:20] sister Megan's here and doing better we
[38:23] been praying for you and I know they had
[38:26] to have some surgery on her foot are
[38:28] looking looking uh doing something on
[38:30] there so um we just trust the Lord amen
[38:33] don't mean to put her on this God
[38:35] bless you s we've been praying her
[38:37] mother-in-law put in a request Wednesday
[38:39] and we I didn't get it till after church
[38:41] so we just went to praying for then so a
[38:43] prayer is good in in the car as it is in
[38:46] the church amen but I really believe
[38:48] that when you get a body of Believers
[38:50] together with common faith and brother
[38:51] Mark and believing for the same thing I
[38:53] believe that God honors our request amen
[38:56] you believe that this morning amen we
[38:58] just want to ask the Lord to come and
[39:00] minister to us if you have a need this
[39:02] morning just lift your hand to the Lord
[39:04] I know he's mindful of what we have need
[39:06] of and certainly certainly more than
[39:09] able amen so let's just bow our heads
[39:11] before we approach the word of God and
[39:13] just ask the Lord to come and anoint it
[39:15] this morning gracious Heavenly Father
[39:18] Lord we are so thankful Lord for another
[39:20] opportunity to come in the house of God
[39:23] and Lord as a body of Believers Lord
[39:26] that we come to Fellowship ship around
[39:28] your word and God knowing that you know
[39:30] all things Lord you know all the good
[39:33] and the bad and every mistake every
[39:35] failure Lord you know all about our life
[39:38] Lord God there's nothing that's hid from
[39:40] you lord it's all made plain Lord we
[39:44] just ask you Lord this morning that you
[39:46] would come and you would anoint the word
[39:47] that's spoken and God that it would be
[39:50] directed to every heart Lord just as you
[39:52] would see fit and God I pray as hearers
[39:55] of the word Lord that we could get out
[39:57] the way and allow you to be able to come
[39:59] and speak and Lord as a speaker Lord to
[40:01] get out of the way Lord that you would
[40:03] have Liberty Lord those that are sick I
[40:05] pray you would touch their bodies Lord
[40:07] and God those that just need a uplifting
[40:10] Lord May something be said that would
[40:11] uplift them God that all the word that's
[40:14] spoke today Lord would be edifying to
[40:16] the body of Christ and would be For Your
[40:19] Glory we ask you for it in the name of
[40:21] Jesus Christ we pray amen amen God bless

[41:16] like to extend the invitation to the
[41:18] church so uh we just want to remember
[41:20] that coming up but I want to read uh
[41:22] Joshua the 6th chapter and the first
[41:25] verse and the Bible says now Jericho was
[41:27] straightly shut up because of the
[41:29] children of Israel none went out and
[41:31] none came in and the Lord said unto
[41:33] Joshua see I have given into thine hand
[41:36] Jericho and the King thereof and the
[41:38] Mighty Men of Valor and I'd also like to
[41:41] read out of Joshua the 2 chapter and
[41:44] we'll read from the first verse the
[41:46] Bible says and Joshua the son of nun
[41:48] sent out of shum two men to spy secretly
[41:52] saying go view the land even Jericho and
[41:54] they went and they came into an harlot's
[41:56] house named Rahab and lodged there and
[41:58] it was the Lord it was told the king of
[42:00] Jericho saying behold there came men in
[42:03] hither tonight to of the children of
[42:05] Israel to search out the country and the
[42:07] king of Jericho said unto Rahab saying
[42:10] bring forth the men that have come to
[42:12] thee which are entered into thine house
[42:14] for they come to search out all of the
[42:16] country and the woman took the two men
[42:18] and hid them and said thus there came
[42:20] men unto me but I wish not where they
[42:23] where they were and it came to pass
[42:24] about the time of the shutting of the
[42:26] gate when it was dark that the men went
[42:27] out and whether the men went I don't
[42:29] know but pursue after them quickly for
[42:31] you shall overtake them but she had
[42:33] brought them up to the roof of the house
[42:35] and hid them with the stalks of flax
[42:37] that she had laid in order upon the roof
[42:40] and the men pursued after them the way
[42:42] to Jordan unto the fors and soon they
[42:44] which pursued after them were gone out
[42:46] and they shut the gate and before they
[42:48] were laid down she came up upon the roof
[42:52] and she said unto the men I know that
[42:54] the Lord hath given you the land and
[42:55] that your terror is Fallen upon on us
[42:57] and that all the inhabitants of the land
[42:59] faint because of you for we have heard
[43:01] how the Lord dried up the water of the
[43:03] Red Sea for you when he came out of
[43:06] Egypt and what he did unto the kingdom
[43:08] or the kings of the amorites that were
[43:10] on the other side of Jordan Sahan and OG
[43:12] and whom you utterly destroyed and as
[43:15] soon as we had heard these things our
[43:16] hearts did melt neither did there remain
[43:18] any more courage in any man because of
[43:21] you for the Lord your God he is God in
[43:24] heaven above and in Earth beneath now
[43:27] now therefore I pray you swear unto me
[43:29] by the Lord since I have showed you
[43:31] kindness that you will also show
[43:33] kindness unto my father's house and give
[43:35] me a true token and we'll just ask the
[43:38] Lord to add his Blessing to the reading
[43:40] of the word this morning and I would
[43:41] like to speak on a cord of
[43:44] Salvation now I know that here we are
[43:47] living in this age and you know of
[43:49] course we see some uh the crazy things
[43:52] that goes on in our world today and and
[43:55] and you know yesterday it wasn't just
[43:56] something that happened uh uh yesterday
[43:59] evening but things that that have been
[44:01] going on it's an evil place that we live
[44:04] and evil times and and I realize that we
[44:06] are living in a time of judgment the
[44:08] Bible tells us this is this is the days
[44:10] of judgment it's the last days it's the
[44:12] end time it's the time of rapture and uh
[44:15] any Bible student knows that God will
[44:17] bring judgment on this world it's not a
[44:19] uh it's an unrepented World by the the
[44:22] desire of the world they have a desire
[44:24] to sin and a desire uh a desire to uh to
[44:28] to not repent and and because of that
[44:31] that God would bring destruction upon
[44:32] the world and and I realized that God
[44:35] but also through His prophets and
[44:37] through his word he always told us that
[44:39] before there would come judgment there
[44:41] would always come a warning and so you
[44:42] can go all the way back into Genesis the
[44:44] 19th Chapter and you'll find when God
[44:46] had first destroyed Sodom and gomorra
[44:48] that before God destroyed Sodom that he
[44:50] sent Angels into Sodom and he took out
[44:53] lot and all that belonged to to lot and
[44:55] his family and the Bible said whenever
[44:57] the the fire was about to fall in Sodom
[44:59] that the angel came to lot and he said
[45:01] Escape for thy life and look not behind
[45:03] thee don't stay in the plain escape to
[45:05] the mountain unless thou be consumed and
[45:07] be uh so so God always warns in the days
[45:10] of Eli and the days of the prophet
[45:12] Samuel when God would bring judgment
[45:14] upon Eli for his for his son's uh uh
[45:17] actions that were never corrected in the
[45:18] Lord but before God brought destruction
[45:21] he sent the prophet Samuel in there and
[45:22] he said to Israel he said the thing
[45:24] which I do this day every ear will
[45:26] tingle he said in that day I will
[45:28] perform against Eli all the things that
[45:30] I have spoken concerning his house and
[45:32] when I begin I will also make an end for
[45:34] I have told him that I will judge his
[45:36] house forever for the iniquity which he
[45:39] knoweth because his sons made themselves
[45:41] vile and he restrained them not in the
[45:43] days of Nineveh whenever God would
[45:45] destroy Nineveh he sent a Prophet by the
[45:47] name of Jonah into Nineveh to to warn
[45:49] Nineveh that there was an oncoming
[45:51] judgment if they didn't repent in the
[45:53] days of of the Prophet Jeremiah then
[45:55] when when God would come to Israel he
[45:57] sent Jeremiah and in and when Babylon
[46:00] had came and they had took over Israel
[46:02] when God spoke to Jeremiah he said now
[46:04] look at Jerusalem and you realize
[46:05] there's no inhabitants in Jerusalem it's
[46:07] a desolate place it's been destroyed the
[46:09] the great things that were growing there
[46:11] and the people that were living there
[46:12] none of it none of it's there any longer
[46:14] he said and if you wonder why it was
[46:16] because of their wickedness which they
[46:18] committed they provoked me to anger they
[46:20] want to burn incense to other gods and
[46:21] they knew uh that that they knew not to
[46:23] do it and neither them or their fathers
[46:26] but how be it here's why God destroyed
[46:28] it he said I sent unto you all my
[46:30] servants the prophets they rose up early
[46:32] and I sent them and I saido not do this
[46:34] abom abominable thing that I hate but
[46:37] they hearken not nor inclin their ear to
[46:40] turn from their wickedness and they
[46:41] burned incense unto other God so we see
[46:43] that anytime in the scripture that
[46:45] there's judgment that comes upon a place
[46:47] that judgment is preceded by a warning
[46:50] from God so God he's a just God he's a
[46:52] god of Mercy he's a god of Grace he's a
[46:54] long-suffering God and and so God would
[46:57] continue to to offer to offer this and
[46:59] so we we see that in this time of
[47:01] Jericho in the days of Joshua and Rahab
[47:04] that here here Jericho had received a
[47:06] sentence from God a judgment for their
[47:08] wickedness and for hundreds of years
[47:10] that God had warned them and turned to
[47:12] turn back to God these were a people
[47:13] that had turned away from God so not
[47:16] only uh the did was it was it just
[47:18] judgment but in the days when Joshua
[47:20] brought the army of Israel to the doors
[47:22] of Jericho it was a it was a fulfillment
[47:25] of the promise of judgment but but it
[47:27] wasn't just a fulfillment of a promise
[47:29] of judgment but brother Mark it was also
[47:31] a fulfillment of a promise to the Seed
[47:33] of Abraham that this land would be given
[47:35] to them so when Joshua's Army is
[47:37] standing at the wall of Jericho it's a
[47:39] two-fold purpose of God one in that God
[47:42] was going to bring judgment on Jericho
[47:44] and two that the land that they
[47:45] inhabited belonged to the children of
[47:47] Israel so it was a promise under the
[47:49] seed of God and so you know I thought
[47:51] when I just read this this morning that
[47:54] here in this land of Jericho I thought
[47:55] this is such a wonderful thing and I I I
[47:58] know you've heard this but here there
[48:00] was a there was a woman by the name of
[48:01] Rahab the Bible called her a harlot she
[48:03] was an illame woman and I thought this
[48:05] is such a powerful Tye because in this
[48:07] land of Jericho that judgment was coming
[48:09] upon there was a gentile woman how many
[48:11] knows Rahab she was a gentile and and so
[48:14] in the middle of this land where
[48:16] judgment was promised was a little
[48:18] Gentile girl that was trapped in this
[48:20] place it wasn't she didn't get there by
[48:22] choice she was just born in the middle
[48:24] of it it wasn't something she decided to
[48:25] be a part of she was rais raised up in
[48:27] it she was brought up in it she was in a
[48:29] condition that she had no way out of I
[48:31] thought that's how we were born into
[48:33] this world brother Wesley we didn't we
[48:34] didn't choose the world that we were
[48:36] born in we didn't choose the condition
[48:38] and the the things that the world would
[48:39] be doing and the things that were going
[48:41] on but we were born in a world that had
[48:43] already received a promise of the
[48:45] Judgment of God but in this world there
[48:47] was this little Gentile bride that had
[48:49] been that she had been pass from one
[48:51] Church to another and one uh one belief
[48:54] to another and one denomination over to
[48:56] another and she would continue to be
[48:58] passed along and searching what was she
[48:59] searching for she was searching for
[49:01] something that would sustain her she was
[49:03] searching just a way to to to have
[49:05] another meal a way to be able to feed
[49:07] her family and just something to to
[49:09] prevent starvation so she would about go
[49:11] through anything in order to uh to pay
[49:13] the price just to be able to make it
[49:15] another day and but I thought here in
[49:17] this condition that she was in that and
[49:19] and maybe it just seemed hopeless and
[49:21] there would never be a way out and there
[49:22] would never be an opportunity and she's
[49:25] always just going to be in this same
[49:26] situ situation and God had just
[49:28] neglected her and he just left her there
[49:29] and you know she she couldn't help her
[49:32] how he's ever looked at your situation
[49:33] said but I didn't do anything to get
[49:35] here what did I do wrong to cause to
[49:36] cause this and where did I mess up to
[49:38] cause this but you realize it had
[49:40] nothing to do with her it wasn't her
[49:42] fault it wasn't nothing she had done it
[49:44] wasn't a mistake she had made it wasn't
[49:45] punishment or or anything like that
[49:47] because in her heart there was something
[49:49] different in her heart she didn't even
[49:51] want to be in the condition that she was
[49:52] in she longed for a way to get out of it
[49:55] and and you know I thought as as as this
[49:57] judgment would begin to build and I I'm
[49:59] sure the pressure around Jericho begin
[50:02] to build up as they begin to feel the
[50:03] pressure of the army of Israel as they
[50:05] were moving across the land and and day
[50:08] after day here there were Caravans that
[50:10] would arrive in Jericho with news that
[50:12] that the army of Joshua was on its way
[50:15] and I could just see with every Wagon
[50:16] Train that came in weary Travelers that
[50:19] would come by and say but there's an
[50:20] army coming there there's this great
[50:22] Army they're coming across the
[50:23] Wilderness you remember the story of
[50:25] when they when they come across the Red
[50:27] Sea some 40 years ago and how that God
[50:29] parted the waters and that Army Coss
[50:32] that same Army and they're just down the
[50:33] road and they're on their way heading in
[50:35] this direction I thought my here as
[50:37] these rumors be begin to come and The
[50:40] Travelers begin to share rumors friends
[50:42] let me tell you those rumors began to
[50:44] build faith in the heart of a woman
[50:46] named Rahab and let me tell you what you
[50:49] know why why it was special to me cuz it
[50:51] didn't matter who said it what matter
[50:52] was who heard it and here she was a girl
[50:55] that was predestinated of God the Bible
[50:57] says faith cometh by hearing and here
[50:59] the faith of God came riding into
[51:01] Jericho with every rumor I thought my
[51:04] here they would come into town and you
[51:05] know what happened brother Mah is that
[51:07] Faith mounted the words of heathen
[51:09] unbelievers as they come into Jericho
[51:11] and they begin to speak and and they
[51:13] would come into this city and that Faith
[51:15] rode right into the heart of a Woman by
[51:17] the name of Rahab and and and with every
[51:19] rumor her faith be to grow and with
[51:21] every rumor there she she be to to see
[51:24] something else and maybe there was an
[51:26] opportunity there and with every rumor
[51:28] she realized that there was a power that
[51:30] was greater than Jericho this very thing
[51:33] that had held her down this thing that
[51:35] had held her in bondage this thing that
[51:37] kept her from being what God had called
[51:39] her to be but there she she started
[51:41] believing that maybe just maybe there's
[51:43] a power that's greater than my bondage
[51:45] maybe there's a power that's greater
[51:47] than my condition maybe there's a power
[51:49] that's greater than my past and greater
[51:52] than my nature and greater than what was
[51:54] handed down for my father and my mother
[51:56] may there's something that's just
[51:57] greater and opportunity be to rise in
[52:01] her heart I thought my that's the way it
[52:03] is but said she wasn't put there on
[52:05] purpose it it wasn't something that she
[52:07] done she didn't even want that way of
[52:08] life it was her parents that put her in
[52:10] it just like many of us today we've been
[52:12] caught up in situations and you you was
[52:14] raised up in conditions and you picked
[52:16] up spirits and and all kinds of
[52:18] religious spirits and alcohol spirits
[52:21] and and and and and anger spirits and
[52:24] and tempers and things that we picked up
[52:26] from from those that come from before us
[52:28] but but but it it just seems like we're
[52:30] in a condition with no foreseeable way
[52:32] out and you know sometimes when you get
[52:34] so bad off can I just preach to a minute
[52:36] sometimes you get so bad off that you
[52:38] think that the Judgment of God might
[52:40] just be a welcomed relief either one way
[52:42] he'll take me out or another way he'll
[52:44] save me but just bring on the Judgment
[52:45] CU I have no way to get out of the
[52:47] condition I was in this is where the
[52:49] heart of Rahab was but with every
[52:52] Caravan brother marah Faith begin to
[52:54] build and she started to see there was a
[52:56] possibility
[52:57] of an opportunity that something could
[52:59] change in her life what if Joshua could
[53:01] bring a Brave New World what if this
[53:03] Army of Israel could come in and and
[53:04] bring a new government and change the
[53:06] way that things are in in in Jericho and
[53:08] maybe they'll they'll they'll make a
[53:10] crops that's a little better and maybe
[53:12] maybe they'll know how to run this place
[53:13] a little better and maybe I could it
[53:15] could be a a little bit better off but
[53:17] friends you realize that there was
[53:18] nothing she she she didn't really
[53:20] realize the power that Joshua actually
[53:22] had because Joshua the Bible would tell
[53:25] us that Joshua he was a type of the Holy
[53:27] Ghost and he had a commission brother
[53:29] Wesley to come into this into this place
[53:32] to bring judgment on a city whatever he
[53:34] would speak it would be done if he
[53:36] judged it it'd be judged if he gave it
[53:37] Grace it would be given Grace He was
[53:39] ordered with a commission from God that
[53:42] whatever Joshua spoke what happened in
[53:44] the land of Jericho do you realize that
[53:46] God gave oh friends I'm I'm preaching to
[53:48] you that God gave his Prophet the
[53:50] ability he gave he gave this Holy Ghost
[53:52] he gave him the ability to bind whatever
[53:55] you bind on Earth will be B found in
[53:56] heaven whatever you loose on Earth will
[53:58] be loose in heaven and he set him loose
[54:00] on this land of Jericho and he came to
[54:02] the walls and begin to speak I thought
[54:04] my the the power of life and death was
[54:08] in his
[54:09] tongue and when it came you realize how
[54:12] helpless she must have felt that no
[54:14] matter what they done they could not
[54:16] stop the Judgment of God friends let me
[54:19] tell you a secret there's no way to stop
[54:21] it there's no way to that you can stop
[54:24] the Judgment of God you you can escape
[54:26] the Judgment of God but you certainly
[54:27] can't stop it see judgment was coming I
[54:30] thought how little she must have felt
[54:32] there are our people are greatly afraid
[54:34] our our people they've heard about you
[54:35] and you know it's just a a terrible
[54:37] thing and and she knew they were coming
[54:39] she met the spies that came to spy out
[54:41] the land but she couldn't stop it and
[54:43] how it must have feel that that that
[54:44] that you know the Judgment of God's
[54:46] coming and there ain't nothing you can
[54:47] do about it and people that will be lost
[54:49] and there's nothing you can do about it
[54:51] and there's no you can't change their
[54:52] situation and you can't make them
[54:54] Believers and you you can't make them
[54:56] turn to God and it don't matter how hard
[54:58] you try or how how much you preach they
[55:00] they just look at you and go go their
[55:02] own way it just don't have any effect on
[55:04] them I realize brother Mark that we're
[55:06] just powerless to stop the Judgment of
[55:08] God I know the people to the world today
[55:10] they don't believe that but let me tell
[55:12] you a little secret this morning that
[55:13] just because you don't believe it
[55:15] certainly ain't going to stop it your
[55:17] unbelief will not stop God's judgment
[55:19] your prayer won't stop God's judgment
[55:21] you can fast till you starve to death
[55:23] you'll never stop God's judgment Satan
[55:25] and his angels are according to the
[55:26] Bible will be burned in a lake of fire
[55:29] and all of those that are partakers of
[55:31] the kingdom of Satan will be burned with
[55:33] him you can't stop the Judgment of God I
[55:37] know what the world's doing today is the
[55:38] world that's taking this and turned and
[55:40] says I'll tell you what we'll do we'll
[55:42] avoid the Judgment of God and we'll just
[55:44] put judgment on the word of God so what
[55:46] they'll do is they just come to judge
[55:47] the word and say well that ain't true
[55:49] there's too many churches that preach
[55:51] too many different things there's too
[55:52] many beliefs there's too many there's
[55:54] too many doctrines and they they try to
[55:55] discredit
[55:56] try to discredit the word of God and
[55:58] they they'll build up beliefs and all
[56:00] these things just to discredit that God
[56:02] even exists you know I thought he isn't
[56:04] it silly that the creation would judge
[56:06] the Creator here the thing that God made
[56:09] would come back and say well let me
[56:11] judge the one that made me and tell you
[56:12] if he's really there and tell you
[56:14] friends let me tell you you got two
[56:15] choices either you believe what the what
[56:17] the science says is that there was a
[56:19] great big bang that came and we all came
[56:21] from nothing and it's there was no
[56:23] meaning behind it it was a total
[56:25] coincidence it was an accident that
[56:26] happened in the universe some millions
[56:28] of years ago that created life form or
[56:31] you can believe that God created the
[56:33] Heaven and the Earth ain't but two
[56:34] beliefs you can pick one or you can pick
[56:36] the other but let me tell you they say
[56:37] well it was a big bang and and it was a
[56:39] great big noise I say friends maybe it
[56:41] was a big bang I think it might have
[56:43] made a big noise when God said let there
[56:45] be light it might have been a big noise
[56:47] when God took an earth that was without
[56:49] form and void and darkness was upon the
[56:51] face of the deep and he took it in his
[56:53] hands and he formed it into a world and
[56:55] he took chaos and he formed it into
[56:57] order I imagine it made quite a racket
[57:00] when the light of God sprung out Across
[57:02] the Universe and breathed life into a in
[57:04] into a dead lifeless thing it was a big
[57:08] it may have been a big b I know what the
[57:10] world says see the if you ever study
[57:12] some science can I just preach a minute
[57:13] y'all go ahead and preach with me if you
[57:14] ever study some science the UN they say
[57:16] the universe is only five things it's
[57:18] time energy space matter and motion
[57:21] that's what the universe is made up of
[57:23] so everything that we are consists of
[57:26] time time energy which is a power so a
[57:28] time there has to be a power source
[57:30] there has to be space there has to be
[57:32] matter and motion you take that out and
[57:34] there ain't nothing exist I thought well
[57:35] my y'all are so close to the truth but
[57:38] you realize that everything that the
[57:40] Universe has and everything that there
[57:42] is to make it you don't even have to
[57:44] read the whole Bible to find it brother
[57:45] Mark it's found in the first two verses
[57:47] the Bible says in Genesis the first
[57:49] chapter in the beginning what was it
[57:51] talking about time in the beginning God
[57:54] created do you want to find a source of
[57:55] power well there's the source of power
[57:57] it was God creating by the power of the
[58:00] spoken word he created what the heavens
[58:03] the space and Earth the matter you say
[58:06] well brother Matt that's all of them but
[58:07] what about the motion there has to be
[58:08] motion to make a universe the Bible said
[58:11] the Earth was without form it was void
[58:13] and darkness was upon the face of the
[58:15] deep and the spirit of God moved upon
[58:19] the face of the waters so there you have
[58:21] it it's time energy space matter and
[58:24] motion it wasn't an accident it it
[58:26] wasn't a coincidence it was the power of
[58:28] the spoken word of a living God that is
[58:31] a reality today he spoke this world I
[58:33] say how wonderful are the works of God
[58:36] it was created by the voice of God he
[58:38] made every mountain and he made the sea
[58:41] he made the forest he made the stream he
[58:43] made the Lakes he made the rivers he
[58:45] made the fish he made every creature
[58:47] Great and Small he made everything and
[58:49] for everything God had a purpose I say
[58:52] how wonderful are his Works David said
[58:55] God created
[58:56] the god the Creator he oh I love can I
[58:59] just tell tell it like David told it I
[59:00] feel like preaching this morning David
[59:02] said God the Creator he wrapped himself
[59:05] in light and he wore it like a garment
[59:07] that's our God his clouds are chariots
[59:10] and he walks on the wings of the wind he
[59:12] makes his Angel Spirits his ministers as
[59:15] flames of fire he laid the foundations
[59:17] of the earth that they could never fall
[59:19] he took the waters that was over the
[59:20] mountains he receded them into the
[59:22] valleys and he set a boundary to keep
[59:24] them where they are and the water flows
[59:27] in the valleys and the springs and the
[59:28] rivers and it comes for a purpose to
[59:30] feed the wild animals and so just so
[59:32] they can have a drink everything that
[59:34] God made brother Mark everything that we
[59:36] see it was God that made it and every
[59:38] bit of it had a purpose the waters even
[59:40] on the Hills they' bring forth fruit he
[59:42] made grass for the cattle sap for the
[59:44] tree tree for the for the birds he made
[59:47] day for work and night for rest how
[59:49] wonderful are your Works David says how
[59:52] wonderful are your Works he said I'll
[59:55] sing of the the Lord as long as I live
[59:57] and I will praise my God while I have a
[59:59] being I wonder for somebody like David
[1:00:01] here this morning it says I will sing
[1:00:04] unto the Lord as long as I live as long
[1:00:06] as I have a being I'll give Praises unto
[1:00:08] my God I'm not an accident hello
[1:00:10] somebody the worst thing you can tell a
[1:00:12] kid is you're an accident we ain't no
[1:00:14] accident we ain't accidentally here we
[1:00:16] ain't some we ain't some some accident
[1:00:18] that happened but we were purposed by
[1:00:20] God when God called you he formed you he
[1:00:23] told Jeremiah I knew you when I formed
[1:00:25] you and before I formed you in your
[1:00:27] mother's womb he knew what color hair
[1:00:29] You' have he knew what color eyes you
[1:00:31] would have he knew he knew how pretty
[1:00:32] and how ugly every one of us said be it
[1:00:34] was God that knew us he made us and he
[1:00:37] made us for his purpose friends how dare
[1:00:40] that we judge the word of God we don't
[1:00:42] have the right to judge the word it's
[1:00:44] the word that judges us I'm just going
[1:00:47] to get straight here the Bible says that
[1:00:50] God would the the word of God listen
[1:00:51] this Bible brother Mark the word of God
[1:00:54] it's the power of God to them that
[1:00:56] believe it and will accept it it may
[1:00:59] just be some some book that's been
[1:01:01] translated a bunch of times to some
[1:01:02] people in this world there's been all
[1:01:04] kinds of translations it may not mean
[1:01:06] nothing to them but to me it's still
[1:01:08] God's word it's still Jesus Christ the
[1:01:11] same yesterday today and forever prophet
[1:01:13] of God said he's Dy Bound by his word he
[1:01:15] must stand by it because it's his word
[1:01:17] and God must judge the world but if God
[1:01:19] is going to judge the world how can he
[1:01:21] judge it he can't judge it by a church
[1:01:23] can you imagine if God took one man's
[1:01:25] church or another the church said well
[1:01:26] I'm going to judge the whole world by
[1:01:28] the Baptist well then everybody else
[1:01:29] will be lost I'll judge the whole world
[1:01:30] by the Catholic well everybody else will
[1:01:32] be lost I'll judge the whole world by
[1:01:33] the Pentecostal everybody else will be
[1:01:35] lost God can't use a church to judge the
[1:01:37] world he said I won't it wasn't a church
[1:01:40] that he promised he didn't promise to
[1:01:41] judge it by a church but he will judge
[1:01:43] the World by Jesus Christ and Christ is
[1:01:46] the word Jesus said If any man hear my
[1:01:49] words and believe not I don't judge him
[1:01:51] but I come to judge the world I come not
[1:01:54] to judge the world but I come to save
[1:01:56] the world but he that rejects me and
[1:01:58] will not receive my word he has one that
[1:02:00] judgeth him for the word that I have
[1:02:02] spoken shall judge him in the last day
[1:02:05] see so it ain't the church that God's
[1:02:06] using it ain't your church my church the
[1:02:09] church down the road it ain't a church
[1:02:11] that God's using to judge the world it's
[1:02:13] the word of God which is Christ Jesus
[1:02:16] that God will use to judge the world
[1:02:18] friends you realize that's what we need
[1:02:19] this morning and that's that's why we
[1:02:20] have a pull pit is to take people back
[1:02:22] to the word of God it's it's to take
[1:02:24] people to an ad abolute something that
[1:02:26] you can anchor your soul in but the
[1:02:28] Jared that you know that when the
[1:02:29] Judgment of God comes that you have
[1:02:31] something to look to I thought my here a
[1:02:33] lot of people live out most of their
[1:02:35] lives they never have an absolute but
[1:02:37] that's what we need this morning we need
[1:02:38] a thorough Vindication of the word of
[1:02:41] God we need a real experience with God
[1:02:43] to be able to believe that God's word is
[1:02:45] true that it came out of the mouth of
[1:02:47] God it's been tampered with it's been
[1:02:49] tainted it's been resp spoken it's been
[1:02:51] it's been reprogrammed every which way
[1:02:53] you can but I thank God that there's
[1:02:55] still a spirit in the land today that
[1:02:57] would turn the heart of the children of
[1:02:59] God back to the original faith and say
[1:03:01] my word is the truth get back to the
[1:03:04] word of God get back to the Bible get
[1:03:06] back to the original creation when God
[1:03:08] said let there be get back to thus
[1:03:10] sayith the Lord again it's God calling
[1:03:13] his church back to a Vindication of the
[1:03:15] word of God see before you can fulfill
[1:03:18] Oh Glory I feel like preaching before
[1:03:20] you can fulfill a commission you realize
[1:03:22] that here even Moses who was a man of
[1:03:24] God he was called of God he was a
[1:03:26] servant of God but he was a he was a man
[1:03:29] that was a runaway servant he was he was
[1:03:31] he was doing everything he could to
[1:03:33] avoid doing what God wanted him to do
[1:03:35] maybe some of you are that way here
[1:03:36] maybe you're a runaway servant of God
[1:03:38] maybe you've been running for a long
[1:03:40] time and you said I know that God's draw
[1:03:42] at me every time I come in the house of
[1:03:44] God God speaks to me every time I allow
[1:03:46] him a minute he's poured at my he's
[1:03:48] pulling at my heart he's drawing me and
[1:03:50] he's pulling at my family but but I
[1:03:52] can't help but there's something else in
[1:03:53] me there's a there's a law of the flesh
[1:03:55] has draw me away from God here was Moses
[1:03:58] brother Mark he was a God's prophet he
[1:04:00] was a man that God would speak lip to
[1:04:02] ear with but even Moses would run from
[1:04:04] the presence of God he was a runaway you
[1:04:08] know what God does to every runaway he
[1:04:10] said all that belongs to me will come to
[1:04:12] me you know what he did he went out
[1:04:15] there he wouldn't meet him in the city
[1:04:17] he wouldn't meet him at the gates Moses
[1:04:18] wouldn't give God enough time to deal
[1:04:20] with him Moses I I'll just go out in the
[1:04:22] wilderness and he ran away and he when
[1:04:24] he got out there in the middle of the
[1:04:25] wilderness one day he was walking and up
[1:04:27] on the mountain there was a fire that
[1:04:29] was burning on a bush and he said what
[1:04:31] an odd thing that the fire is burning
[1:04:33] but the bush is not consumed and it draw
[1:04:36] Moses up on a mountain friends don't you
[1:04:38] realize that's what God is trying to do
[1:04:40] today he's got a pillar of fire that's
[1:04:42] been held over the people of God he's
[1:04:44] saying it it's something that when you
[1:04:46] see it it'll draw you to it brother Tom
[1:04:48] it draws you out of the out of the
[1:04:49] valley it draws you out of your
[1:04:51] condition to come and have a meeting
[1:04:53] with God right when he came to this
[1:04:55] place God said Moses what do you have in
[1:04:57] your hand well I I got a little old
[1:04:59] stick he said throw it on the ground he
[1:05:00] threw it on the ground it became a
[1:05:02] serpent he said now pick it up when he
[1:05:04] picked it up it became a stick again he
[1:05:06] said what was it it was God giving Moses
[1:05:08] an absolute it was a Moses this whole
[1:05:11] time he knew he was chosen for it but he
[1:05:13] just didn't have an absolute but
[1:05:15] whenever God done that he gave him a
[1:05:17] Vindication of the absolute see when he
[1:05:20] giv him this brother Mark it removed the
[1:05:22] question you realize that's what the
[1:05:24] purpose of the message was it was to
[1:05:26] remove the question of God's absolute it
[1:05:28] was for God to come and vindicate that
[1:05:30] all the things that he's told in this
[1:05:33] Bible that they were true in the middle
[1:05:34] of 2024 that we' hadn't look back and
[1:05:37] say well that's just something of
[1:05:38] history and that's just a god of history
[1:05:40] and God don't do that kind of stuff no
[1:05:42] more but it was sent as a Vindication of
[1:05:45] the very absolute that God had already
[1:05:47] sent oh let me tell you friends in that
[1:05:49] absolute when it got in the hand of
[1:05:51] Moses it became a rod of judgment over
[1:05:54] Egypt here a prophet of God he took an
[1:05:56] absolute and he went he went that was
[1:05:58] Vindicated by God and he went into Egypt
[1:06:01] and he set his people free that's what
[1:06:03] we need this morning we need an absolute
[1:06:06] you need God to vindicate the word to
[1:06:08] you in order in order for something that
[1:06:09] you can establish your life on I
[1:06:11] remember can I just tell this story I
[1:06:13] remember brother B telling this story
[1:06:15] one time of how that he would remember
[1:06:16] he had a had this this this uh the dream
[1:06:19] or a vision that he had of a snake that
[1:06:22] was trying to kill one of his friends
[1:06:23] and he he tells it like this he said you
[1:06:25] know he said I spoke to it and and it
[1:06:28] and it and it and it consumed itself and
[1:06:30] it went away went up in a blue smoke he
[1:06:31] said but whenever I I woke up he said I
[1:06:33] looked up and there was this little
[1:06:35] there was this thing this evil thing
[1:06:36] over in the corner of my bedroom and it
[1:06:38] was sitting there mocking him and and
[1:06:40] making fun of him and he said it just
[1:06:43] started saying and saying well you you
[1:06:45] ain't nothing it was just Old Demon
[1:06:46] Spirit speaking you have no no power
[1:06:48] with God and you're just a bluff and you
[1:06:50] have you have no power he said but I
[1:06:52] said Satan you're an offense to me get
[1:06:54] out of my way in the name of Jesus
[1:06:55] Christ he said I laid there in a little
[1:06:57] bit in the bed and I started to raise up
[1:06:59] and I felt this little Spirit come by
[1:07:01] this sweet Spirit he said I wonder if
[1:07:03] the spirit of the Lord is near now he
[1:07:05] said this sweetest voice that I've ever
[1:07:07] heard I I ever heard in my life it said
[1:07:10] Don't Fear to go anywhere or fear to do
[1:07:12] anything for the never failing presence
[1:07:14] of Jesus Christ is with you wherever you
[1:07:16] go said that settled it for me it it
[1:07:19] didn't let them rage I've got an
[1:07:21] absolute I've got an anchor that holds
[1:07:23] Yonder because it's the word of the
[1:07:24] Living God he said if you ain't got that
[1:07:26] kind of absolute that's what we need
[1:07:28] this morning I want something that'll
[1:07:30] punctuate the word of God and I can see
[1:07:32] the word of God made manifest I wonder
[1:07:34] how many have that request this morning
[1:07:36] God give me an absolute that'll cause me
[1:07:38] to to punctuate God's word and to see it
[1:07:41] made manifest I thought what a tie This
[1:07:42] Is Not only would he punctuate it but
[1:07:45] that absolute it'll cause you to back
[1:07:47] the word or get behind God's word and
[1:07:49] it'll cause that word to come to pass in
[1:07:51] your life I was preaching on it
[1:07:52] Wednesday night on manifesting God's
[1:07:54] purpose you realize it brother Mark that
[1:07:56] you just backing God's word and getting
[1:07:58] behind the word of God it causes the
[1:08:00] blessing of God to come upon you that
[1:08:02] ain't that ain't brother match blessing
[1:08:04] that's the that's the law of God it come
[1:08:05] out of the book of Deuteronomy he said
[1:08:07] out of the mouth of two or three
[1:08:09] Witnesses let every matter be
[1:08:11] established so we need an absolute
[1:08:13] brother Mark that could get behind the
[1:08:15] word we need an absolute that would
[1:08:17] cause us to support something you
[1:08:18] realize that all the work and the effort
[1:08:20] that you're doing in your life let me
[1:08:22] ask you for what purpose are you doing
[1:08:24] it are you doing it to build a bigger
[1:08:25] house are we doing it to have another
[1:08:27] car are we doing it to have in a few
[1:08:29] years there ain't none of it going to
[1:08:30] matter in a few years you'll meet God
[1:08:32] one way or another and you'll have to
[1:08:33] answer to God and say well that all that
[1:08:36] all that I done did it have any purpose
[1:08:38] but we need an absolute something that
[1:08:40] we can build our life around that has
[1:08:43] purpose something that has meaning that
[1:08:45] that would fulfill that emptiness that's
[1:08:46] inside of you that's always been there
[1:08:49] no matter what you've ever done no
[1:08:50] matter what job you've ever had no
[1:08:52] matter who you married or where you've
[1:08:53] been there's still an emptiness in there
[1:08:55] what is it it's a place that God is
[1:08:57] longing to F that you could fulfill the
[1:09:00] purpose that God has for your life we
[1:09:02] need an absolute you said well what is
[1:09:04] it it's the holy spirit it's the spirit
[1:09:07] of God he said that Spirit you don't
[1:09:08] have to worry about it it'll only cause
[1:09:10] you to back the word of God it won't
[1:09:12] make you say Amen to some manmade Creed
[1:09:14] or something like that but the Holy
[1:09:16] Spirit it'll lead you the right way
[1:09:18] it'll get behind the word of God and
[1:09:21] notice here's what was happening when
[1:09:23] these two spies come to Jericho
[1:09:26] brother Mark when they come to this
[1:09:27] place now just can I just tell this as a
[1:09:30] story here when they when they came into
[1:09:32] this place that that that Rahab of
[1:09:35] course the Bible would tell us that she
[1:09:36] was a a harlot and that she was raised
[1:09:39] in in this in this place you know she
[1:09:43] brother dramatized this says you know
[1:09:45] you know maybe she was maybe she was
[1:09:46] poor and she didn't have anything and
[1:09:48] her parents you know or old crippled
[1:09:50] daddy or something that she was out
[1:09:52] there working and just trying an ill-
[1:09:54] Fame woman just trying to make a way for
[1:09:56] their family this little girl that grew
[1:09:58] up in the streets of Jericho and tried
[1:10:00] to make a living there was no way for
[1:10:02] her to work as as a girl in those days
[1:10:05] they didn't they didn't go work for
[1:10:06] money most of them just worked around
[1:10:08] the house and in Homemakers and so and
[1:10:10] they didn't have the ability but she
[1:10:12] went out and just trying to do something
[1:10:13] to provide for her family but I can
[1:10:15] imagine that the whole time that she
[1:10:17] knew what she was doing was wrong there
[1:10:19] was something in her that told her that
[1:10:21] it wasn't right to do it there was
[1:10:22] something in her that longed for
[1:10:23] something else this this is isn't who I
[1:10:25] want to be and this this isn't the kind
[1:10:27] of person that I want to be but I know
[1:10:29] that God is calling me to something
[1:10:31] greater but one day she heard that there
[1:10:33] was a God that was moving and in her
[1:10:37] heart it began to tremble brother marah
[1:10:39] and you know what brother M says she
[1:10:40] found a Messer from that great move that
[1:10:43] told her what was going to take place
[1:10:45] she she got the Feeling what was going
[1:10:46] on in the land in this age of judgment
[1:10:49] but but in her heart began to tremble
[1:10:51] she realized that that there was things
[1:10:52] that were things were shook up that was
[1:10:54] UNS ESS there was uncertainty in the
[1:10:56] world so she found a messenger from that
[1:10:59] great move and he told her what was
[1:11:00] going to take place he said and notice
[1:11:02] that Rahab she didn't even ask to see a
[1:11:05] sign from Joshua you know what she done
[1:11:07] she was a I oh I love this huh she he
[1:11:09] says she was a type of the church a type
[1:11:11] of the true church she's been pulled
[1:11:13] away into all kinds of prostitution one
[1:11:15] day she was a Methodist the next day she
[1:11:17] was a Baptist the next day she was a
[1:11:19] presbyterian the next day she was
[1:11:21] something else people are pulled from
[1:11:22] one thing to another and they're never
[1:11:24] drawn to God She was drawn into every
[1:11:26] kind of system that there was but one
[1:11:28] day she met a messenger that came from
[1:11:31] the move of God and he told her that God
[1:11:33] is coming he'll judge that thing that's
[1:11:35] been built up that thing that's brought
[1:11:37] death to so many that that old that old
[1:11:39] mystery Babylon that you call that that
[1:11:41] has brought destruction that that vile
[1:11:44] creature that was made by by Satan
[1:11:46] himself that would that would deceive
[1:11:48] the very people of God but she heard a a
[1:11:52] word from the move of God from a
[1:11:54] messenger that a move is going to take
[1:11:56] place said she was the type of the
[1:11:58] church but all of a sudden a little
[1:12:00] preacher enters into the City and says
[1:12:02] there's a God that lives that's it on he
[1:12:05] lived yesterday and he's the same today
[1:12:08] and his power is yet the same and he
[1:12:09] does the same works that he did when he
[1:12:11] was here on the earth and friends his
[1:12:13] agents are on the road today my is't
[1:12:15] that something it took a little preacher
[1:12:17] a couple preachers to come by our house
[1:12:19] and to say the same you you realize what
[1:12:21] she told the preachers she told them she
[1:12:23] said I've heard of your God over when he
[1:12:25] brought y'all out of Egypt and he rolled
[1:12:27] back to Red Sea I've heard of your God
[1:12:30] when you came in and he took that that
[1:12:32] whole nation of kings and y'all didn't
[1:12:34] even have the ability to do it I've
[1:12:35] heard of your God how Mighty he is but
[1:12:37] you know what they did Brother marah
[1:12:39] they didn't leave God in the past they
[1:12:41] didn't leave him at the Red Sea they
[1:12:43] didn't leave him at at the kings that
[1:12:44] they had taken he said he's the same God
[1:12:46] today he's the same he's moving into
[1:12:49] Jericho he'll bring judgment Upon This
[1:12:51] land and and if you want to be saved
[1:12:54] then you better turn to God
[1:12:56] they brought her they brought God out of
[1:12:58] history and preached it in her house
[1:13:01] said see now Rahab she was a known
[1:13:03] Harlot she was the type of the believer
[1:13:05] today she was a real believer and she
[1:13:08] didn't say I hear that Joshua can do
[1:13:10] signs because he's the successor of
[1:13:12] Moses so I'd like to see those signs
[1:13:13] isn't that the way people tell you today
[1:13:15] when you go telling them about the word
[1:13:17] of God and all and and God being well
[1:13:19] show me a sign that God's real take this
[1:13:21] crippled person and raise him up and
[1:13:22] show me that God's still heal say
[1:13:24] friends let me tell tell you I've seen a
[1:13:26] crippled person that was 6 years that
[1:13:27] was paralyzed that got up in the middle
[1:13:29] of a meeting and came to the front of
[1:13:30] the meeting walking I've seen people
[1:13:32] that were blind that their eyes were
[1:13:33] open I've seen people that were dead
[1:13:35] that God gave them back their life you
[1:13:37] come too late to tell me that God ain't
[1:13:38] a Healer and God God ain't still real
[1:13:40] and he ain't doing the same things that
[1:13:42] he's always done he's still God but
[1:13:44] never did I approach God and say God if
[1:13:46] you'll show me that then I'll believe
[1:13:48] you I was a Believer before God ever
[1:13:50] done any of it I was a Believer before I
[1:13:52] ever saw God move in a miraculous way I
[1:13:55] was a Believer before I ever saw the
[1:13:57] pillar of fire I was a Believer before I
[1:13:59] ever saw the miracles of god I was
[1:14:02] already a Believer said that's the way
[1:14:04] Rahab was she didn't ask to see those
[1:14:07] signs she said we didn't have to see
[1:14:09] those I I think this is so good he said
[1:14:11] why she didn't ask to see him is because
[1:14:13] Moses when he had SE when he had signs
[1:14:16] he went and performed the signs but
[1:14:18] there was a reason why Moses performed
[1:14:20] the signs because he was Vindicated as a
[1:14:23] prophet of God so God gave the signs to
[1:14:26] Moses to vindicate the commission that
[1:14:28] Moses had he said but the sign isn't
[1:14:31] what took him into the promised land
[1:14:33] what makes me want to dance all over
[1:14:35] this building but a mark it wasn't the
[1:14:37] sign that let him over it wasn't the
[1:14:39] sign that took him in it wasn't a sign
[1:14:42] that c that that caused them to be able
[1:14:43] to have their inheritance he said see it
[1:14:45] wasn't the sign was only a Vindication
[1:14:48] of the commission I think that's what
[1:14:49] people need to hear today they're still
[1:14:51] looking for a sign men standing in their
[1:14:53] pull pits trying to trying to to mimic a
[1:14:55] prophet of God and trying to do the same
[1:14:57] things he done and act like he act and
[1:15:00] talk like he talked and produce the same
[1:15:02] sign but there ain't going to be another
[1:15:04] sign given there's a sign that's given
[1:15:06] to a generation to vindicate the
[1:15:08] commission of Moses the prophet of God
[1:15:11] and when Joshua came it wasn't a sign
[1:15:13] that took him in anyway I know this is
[1:15:16] may be much but it's the truth the sign
[1:15:20] ain't what took them in brother Wesley
[1:15:22] why are we looking for signs before we
[1:15:23] worship God yeah we looking if I seen a
[1:15:26] cloud on the wall I'd be a real believer
[1:15:27] then if I seen the pillar fire up there
[1:15:30] oh I'd come to church different then I'd
[1:15:31] have my hands raised I'd stand on my
[1:15:33] feet when the preacher's preaching I'd
[1:15:35] say Amen I'd shout Glory if i' just seen
[1:15:37] a sign why are we looking for signs
[1:15:38] anyway so the sign was sent to vindicate
[1:15:41] Moses but the sign ain't what took him
[1:15:43] in the promised land you notice she
[1:15:45] never asked for that she said she
[1:15:48] believed it without seeing anything she
[1:15:50] believed what they were and here them
[1:15:52] spies brother Mark when the men came
[1:15:54] looking for him she hit him she said I
[1:15:56] pray I swear you by the Lord since I
[1:15:59] have showed you kindness that you will
[1:16:01] also show kindness unto my father's
[1:16:02] house and give me now listen I want to
[1:16:05] make a point and give me a true token
[1:16:08] listen a Scarlet this scarlet cord that
[1:16:11] they came out of the window with they
[1:16:13] told her you hang it in your window and
[1:16:15] when death strikes there'll be life in
[1:16:17] this house when judgment strikes Jericho
[1:16:20] there'll be life in the house of Rahab
[1:16:22] you you realize that brother Mark when
[1:16:23] she hid those Messengers MERS they ask
[1:16:26] her what do you want you realize what
[1:16:28] they're asking they're asking her to
[1:16:31] open the desire of her heart to them
[1:16:35] what is it that you long for what is it
[1:16:38] that you desire what is it that you want
[1:16:40] here brother Mark but when they would
[1:16:41] ask her this she said I want my family
[1:16:43] saved I want you to show me give me a
[1:16:46] true token but notice brother Jared what
[1:16:48] she didn't know is that to have a token
[1:16:51] was already a promise of God when they
[1:16:53] came out of Egypt here she was asking
[1:16:56] for something and she didn't even know
[1:16:58] that her request had already been a
[1:16:59] promise of God you remember when Moses
[1:17:01] come out of Egypt and the Death Angel
[1:17:03] would come come upon Egypt that Moses
[1:17:05] that God told him he said but you take
[1:17:07] the sacrifice and put the blood on the
[1:17:08] door and when I see the blood I will
[1:17:11] pass over you so to her when the death
[1:17:14] angel came to to Israel and or to Egypt
[1:17:17] and and all the firstborn were killed
[1:17:19] the death angel came through the land
[1:17:21] and it went right by every house that
[1:17:22] had the blood on display it was a token
[1:17:24] the the Bible says it was a memorial for
[1:17:26] God to know to pass by it he says see so
[1:17:29] whenever she when she asked for this and
[1:17:31] they asked her when what is your desire
[1:17:34] she begins to speak the desire of her
[1:17:36] heart I want a true token he said but
[1:17:38] notice that when she asked for a desire
[1:17:40] or she told her desire then the men of
[1:17:42] God were able to tell her that that
[1:17:44] ain't just a desire but that's actually
[1:17:46] a promise of God oh friends let me tell
[1:17:48] you something you don't talking about
[1:17:50] changing your faith but when your desire
[1:17:52] becomes a promise it changes the way you
[1:17:54] you look at things when your desire
[1:17:56] becomes a promise it changes the way you
[1:17:58] see your future or you can say well
[1:18:00] brother man I have a desire to receive
[1:18:02] the Holy Ghost well friends I'm here to
[1:18:04] tell you it ain't just a desire it's a
[1:18:06] promise of God and through the prophet
[1:18:08] Joel you said I have a desire to be
[1:18:10] healed it ain't just a desire it's a
[1:18:12] promise of God he said by my stripes
[1:18:15] they are healed I got a desire to see my
[1:18:17] children saved it ain't just a desire
[1:18:19] it's a promise of God David said Delight
[1:18:22] thyself in the Lord and He Shall give
[1:18:24] you the desire desires of your heart you
[1:18:26] desire something but Mark where did that
[1:18:28] Godly desire come from it came from God
[1:18:30] oh friends but tell you whenever your
[1:18:32] desire turns to a promise when a that
[1:18:35] that promise of God it can't lie it's
[1:18:37] the promise made by God he said he made
[1:18:39] a promise by two immutable things one
[1:18:41] that God can't lie and it's God that
[1:18:43] made the promise to you and it can't
[1:18:45] change when your desire brother Mark
[1:18:48] when your desire becomes a promise
[1:18:51] you're looking out different window amen
[1:18:53] now you're looking out rahab's window
[1:18:55] when the Judgment of of Israel came
[1:18:57] walking around the walls of Jericho out
[1:18:59] of every window they were trembling out
[1:19:01] of every window they were shaken and
[1:19:03] they were in the fear of judgment but
[1:19:04] when Rahab looked out and she saw the
[1:19:06] army of God she didn't see them as
[1:19:08] judgment she saw him as a promise of
[1:19:10] Salvation no longer when you're looking
[1:19:12] out rahab's window brother Jared or
[1:19:14] you're looking at judgment but you're
[1:19:15] looking at the Salvation of God let me
[1:19:19] ask you that this morning what do you
[1:19:21] see when you look out the window what do
[1:19:23] you see when you look at the World
[1:19:25] Fallen apart and the destruction and the
[1:19:27] wars and the rumors of wars and the
[1:19:29] promise of oncoming judgment do you see
[1:19:31] judgment and fear and Chaos or do you
[1:19:33] see the salvation of the Lord you see
[1:19:36] when her desire became promised it
[1:19:39] changed the way she saw it her desire it
[1:19:42] became promised she when she heard
[1:19:44] judgment she heard those old footsteps I
[1:19:46] could just see Rahab sister Lillian as
[1:19:49] she would hear the Army begin to March
[1:19:51] around the walls of Jericho and all all
[1:19:54] the maybe everybody get a little shook
[1:19:56] up in the house but she' go over to the
[1:19:58] window and check and make sure that that
[1:20:00] cord was still there you know after a
[1:20:03] little while they the old place started
[1:20:04] rumbling and walls started falling down
[1:20:07] and all around her house every I don't
[1:20:09] even think the house of Rahab even shook
[1:20:12] I think when the walls fell down the
[1:20:14] foundations of it didn't even Shake
[1:20:15] that's the power of God but it stayed
[1:20:18] there the Bible says her house was upon
[1:20:20] the wall and the walls fell down flat
[1:20:23] but whenever the walls Begin to Fall
[1:20:25] with the Tom she'd go look out make sure
[1:20:28] that cord was still there my brother
[1:20:30] Mark it was it was a different window
[1:20:33] her desire became salvation she realized
[1:20:36] that whenever this Begin to Fall the
[1:20:38] pressure all the things begin to build
[1:20:40] up she had a promise of God let me tell
[1:20:43] you what that I can just hear those
[1:20:44] preachers I got just a minute I can just
[1:20:46] hear those preachers when they're
[1:20:47] talking to her and she says I heard
[1:20:49] about your God and what he did when he
[1:20:50] come out of Egypt I could just hear him
[1:20:52] saying oh it was it was more than that
[1:20:54] let me tell you let me tell you exactly
[1:20:56] what God Said have you ever I know
[1:20:57] you've heard a rumor and I I know you've
[1:20:59] kind of heard some hearsay but can we
[1:21:00] tell you exactly what God said when he
[1:21:02] came down there when God came to Egypt
[1:21:05] or or to Israel he said unto them he
[1:21:07] said I will pass through the land of
[1:21:10] Egypt this night and I will Smite the
[1:21:12] firstborn but then he said but in the
[1:21:14] blood he said but you'll take the gods
[1:21:17] of Egypt I'll execute my judgment Fring
[1:21:19] the Lord and the blood shall be to you
[1:21:21] for a token upon the houses where you
[1:21:23] are and when I see the blood I will pass
[1:21:25] over you and the plague shall not be
[1:21:28] upon you or destroy you when I smite the
[1:21:31] land of Egypt oh they just wanted to let
[1:21:33] her know how God really worded it I can
[1:21:35] imagine one of them oh one of the other
[1:21:37] ones said just break it down for a
[1:21:38] little bit more oh listen what God Said
[1:21:40] in verse 12 he said when it comes to the
[1:21:43] land of Egypt I will pass through the
[1:21:45] land of Egypt but when it comes to the
[1:21:47] believer he said I will pass over her I
[1:21:50] said oh my it's God that when he comes
[1:21:52] through judgment May sweep through the
[1:21:54] land it may lay every stone upon the
[1:21:57] ground where there ain't a stone left
[1:21:58] upon a stone but when it comes to the
[1:22:00] people of God he said I will pass over
[1:22:02] her let me tell you friends the Judgment
[1:22:05] of God is passed over you you say
[1:22:07] brother M how would it do it because she
[1:22:09] had a token from God that was displayed
[1:22:12] it was a representation of the blood of
[1:22:15] the Covenant of God but the mark that
[1:22:17] the enemy or that the Judgment of God
[1:22:19] could not even strike her life butam
[1:22:21] said there it was applied it was the
[1:22:22] blood of the Lord Jesus it was made a
[1:22:24] scarlet cord what a type it is for us he
[1:22:27] said it was a blood it it was a it it
[1:22:29] was a type of the blood of Jesus and she
[1:22:31] hung it out of her window but notice
[1:22:33] that when she displayed it she displayed
[1:22:36] it publicly this is what God's asking
[1:22:38] for told her you you do you believe that
[1:22:41] God is God enough that had she not hung
[1:22:43] the cord out her window that she could
[1:22:44] have still been saved how many believes
[1:22:46] that how many believes it took a cord
[1:22:48] for God to save her house how many
[1:22:50] thinks it had to be a rope hanging out a
[1:22:51] window for God to have the power to keep
[1:22:53] her house from falling fall down when
[1:22:55] all the rest of them fell down around it
[1:22:56] God didn't need the cord but he done it
[1:22:58] for a sign said listen what is he
[1:23:00] showing us that there was there would be
[1:23:02] a token of blood that that that God
[1:23:04] would hang over us and notice he asked
[1:23:07] her to display it publicly why would God
[1:23:09] tell her to display it publicly he could
[1:23:11] have done it just because of what
[1:23:12] changed in her heart but he asked her to
[1:23:14] display it publicly but Mark you know
[1:23:16] why because for her whole entire lie
[1:23:19] there had been a sign that was hanging
[1:23:20] on her door and I don't have to explain
[1:23:21] to you what it said but but God asked
[1:23:24] her whenever something changed in her
[1:23:25] heart the sign changed I could see this
[1:23:28] woman when she went out and said I'm not
[1:23:30] going to be that what I came out of but
[1:23:32] God promised to save me I've been trying
[1:23:34] to get out this long enough I'm tired of
[1:23:36] being an alcoholic I'm tired of being a
[1:23:38] Harley I'm tired of being in this
[1:23:39] condition I don't want to be in it no
[1:23:41] more and she kicked the old sign down
[1:23:43] and took the sign that God told her to
[1:23:44] hang and hung it out her window he said
[1:23:47] what did she do she displayed it
[1:23:49] publicly to let that old world know the
[1:23:52] people that saw what's the matter with
[1:23:53] her there's something something
[1:23:54] different let me tell you what's matter
[1:23:56] there's something different hanging out
[1:23:57] rahab's window this morning it ain't the
[1:23:59] same sign she ain't the same woman she
[1:24:02] ain't the person you used to know but
[1:24:03] she's got something on display in her
[1:24:05] life it's a new creation it's a brand
[1:24:08] new man it's a person that God took and
[1:24:10] he changed their life from the inside
[1:24:12] out and now they're displaying the very
[1:24:14] life of Jesus Christ he displayed it
[1:24:17] pugging no wonder that we dress in
[1:24:18] Holiness you want to wonder where that
[1:24:20] came from because God requires you
[1:24:22] display it publicly Bo are dress and the
[1:24:25] way we Act and the way we present
[1:24:27] ourselves to the world that we live in
[1:24:29] it's a sign of God being displayed to
[1:24:31] the world it's the very Covenant of the
[1:24:33] blood of Jesus Christ it's a sign of
[1:24:35] Holiness it's on display to let the
[1:24:37] world know that the old sign ain't
[1:24:38] hanging on this window anymore but I
[1:24:41] have a new sign on display and I want it
[1:24:43] to be made public this morning that God
[1:24:46] has came into my house and he's gave me
[1:24:48] a true token that in the days of
[1:24:49] judgment that I'll be spared she she
[1:24:52] displayed it publicly so that's the way
[1:24:55] the blood has got to be displayed it's
[1:24:57] got to be hanging on the outside of the
[1:24:58] wall that's the way it was in Egypt
[1:25:00] that's the way it was in rahab's house
[1:25:02] and that's the way it is for me and you
[1:25:04] it's got to be hung on the outside to
[1:25:06] show that on the inside something has
[1:25:08] been taking place that's the way the
[1:25:10] True Believer is in Christ this morning
[1:25:12] on the outside is the display of the
[1:25:14] blood of the Lord Jesus have you ever
[1:25:16] thought about that the way you live your
[1:25:18] life on the outside is the display of
[1:25:22] the blood of the Lord Jesus there
[1:25:24] they're looking for a sign of God
[1:25:26] they're looking for a sign of the
[1:25:27] Resurrection they're looking for a sign
[1:25:29] that God is real but do you realize that
[1:25:31] when you walk around in this world that
[1:25:33] it's the blood of Jesus that is on
[1:25:35] display the grace of God that could take
[1:25:38] a life that was lost a person that's
[1:25:40] this heart was black and evil thoughts
[1:25:42] that was in their mind continually
[1:25:45] hatred and bitterness and envy and all
[1:25:47] these things that come with it but then
[1:25:49] God would come and change the
[1:25:51] heart said what happens we put a
[1:25:53] different sign on display to show that
[1:25:56] something has taken place on the inside
[1:25:59] said and when through this God looked
[1:26:01] down when the Wrath fell and the
[1:26:03] trumpets begin to blow and God seen that
[1:26:05] scarlet cord hanging there as a memorial
[1:26:07] let me tell Oh Glory to God but Xavier
[1:26:11] God didn't see listen he didn't he
[1:26:13] didn't see her as a
[1:26:14] harlot he didn't see her as a failure he

[1:27:51] the token on display in your life I I
[1:27:54] know that people say Well it that token
[1:27:57] it represented Christ but can I look at
[1:27:59] it just a little deeper just a minute
[1:28:01] can I have a minute just a little deeper
[1:28:04] to see not only brother Mark did was it
[1:28:07] Christ but notice what she had actually
[1:28:09] accepted see when those men came they
[1:28:11] brought a message to her telling her
[1:28:12] what was about to take place and
[1:28:14] something in her heart caused her to
[1:28:16] believe the message that was brought see
[1:28:18] so she Vindicated that she had now when
[1:28:20] the message came that but now many say
[1:28:22] well I believe it I some say I do some
[1:28:24] say I don't but it doesn't matter what
[1:28:26] they say but she Vindicated that she
[1:28:28] believed it not because of what she said
[1:28:30] brother Jared but she Vindicated it by
[1:28:32] what she put on display see when they
[1:28:35] told her when you hang the Scarlet Court
[1:28:36] out your window it'll bring Salvation to
[1:28:38] your household she Vindicated that she
[1:28:41] believed that message because she put it
[1:28:43] on
[1:28:43] display you realize that brother wesy so
[1:28:46] so her promise it came out of the mouth
[1:28:48] of a messenger she in her house would be
[1:28:50] saved I I wasn't there to hear him
[1:28:52] brother Mark I didn't hear what they
[1:28:53] told her I just read about it but I know
[1:28:55] one thing's for certain that she
[1:28:56] believed it you say how do you know she
[1:28:58] believed it because she displayed it you
[1:29:01] say well that how do I know I believe
[1:29:02] the message God sent today well it'll be
[1:29:04] on display in your life right if it was
[1:29:06] the same way for Rahab it was the same
[1:29:08] way they were in the in the days of
[1:29:10] Egypt it's the same same way today
[1:29:12] whenever God sends a message to his
[1:29:13] people how do you know that you believe
[1:29:16] the message will you'll take the message
[1:29:17] that God sent and put it on display in
[1:29:19] your life the sign will be different the
[1:29:22] th that that scarlet cord will be
[1:29:23] hanging out the window brother Mark it's
[1:29:25] the blood of Jesus Christ that is
[1:29:27] hanging over our life and when judgment
[1:29:29] came to that City let me tell you what
[1:29:30] happened she was safely hidden away she
[1:29:33] protected and she supported the men of
[1:29:35] God she she took the word that God sent
[1:29:37] her she accepted the message as a way
[1:29:39] out of her condition see that's what
[1:29:41] happens today that when God sends a
[1:29:43] message to your house he's looking for
[1:29:45] somebody that'll get behind it when he
[1:29:46] sends Joshua he sends the Holy Ghost to
[1:29:49] this place he's looking for somebody
[1:29:51] that'll get behind what the messenger
[1:29:52] said and that's what she done she said I
[1:29:54] believe what you're saying I believe
[1:29:56] your God is a God I believe he's a
[1:29:58] deliverer I believe he's the real God I
[1:30:01] believe he's the creator of the Heaven
[1:30:02] and the earth I believe that judgment's
[1:30:04] coming and I believe that he'll save me
[1:30:06] and my family and Joshua said to them he
[1:30:10] said the city shall be cursed all that
[1:30:13] are in it will be cursed to the Lord but
[1:30:17] only Rahab the Harlot shall live she and
[1:30:20] all that are with her in her house
[1:30:23] because she hid The Messengers that we
[1:30:25] sent my isn't that something brother
[1:30:27] Mark that Scarlet core that was bound
[1:30:30] out her window was a protection for her
[1:30:32] house but said it was a protection for
[1:30:34] her because she received the message
[1:30:37] that God sent and she when she received
[1:30:39] it brother the mark she displayed it and
[1:30:41] it protected her said you you see that
[1:30:44] she was such a type of the Gentile
[1:30:46] church when they heard the message we
[1:30:48] were all out there and all these things
[1:30:50] and spiritual fornications against the
[1:30:52] god of Heaven all the things but
[1:30:54] whenever we heard that there was a God
[1:30:56] that still lived that could still
[1:30:58] perform Miracles quickly we received the
[1:31:01] message when we heard that there was a
[1:31:03] God that still lived then quickly we
[1:31:05] believed it when we heard that there was
[1:31:07] a God that still can then quickly we
[1:31:10] believed it when we heard there was a
[1:31:11] God that could still heal the sick we
[1:31:13] believed him when we heard there was a
[1:31:15] God that could still raise the dead we
[1:31:17] believed it we didn't go looking for
[1:31:18] some proof of it we just believed it
[1:31:20] when we heard of it he said listen when
[1:31:23] she quit quickly believed it and she
[1:31:25] quickly received the message I thought
[1:31:27] my this is the way our God is when we
[1:31:28] heard it how many when they heard it
[1:31:30] they believed it when you heard that God
[1:31:32] can can raise the dead how many say I
[1:31:33] believe it when you hear that God can
[1:31:35] heal the sick how many say I believe it
[1:31:37] when you hear that God can deliver
[1:31:39] somebody of some substance abuse you say
[1:31:42] I believe it when you hear that God can
[1:31:43] take a temper off a man that you say I
[1:31:46] believe it why we heard it and we
[1:31:48] believe the the the mouth of God so when
[1:31:51] we believe it that's what God's looking
[1:31:53] for he's already a God that can he's
[1:31:55] just looking for a people that will he's
[1:31:57] looking for a people that'll stand
[1:31:59] behind the word of God he's looking for
[1:32:01] a people that will accept his word
[1:32:02] that'll get behind the word that'll
[1:32:04] surrender to him the people that will
[1:32:05] accept the token of God and put it on
[1:32:07] display in their life as a music players
[1:32:09] would come that's what God's looking for
[1:32:11] this morning he's looking for a people
[1:32:13] that will he's a God that can needing a
[1:32:15] people that will amen let me tell you
[1:32:17] how he was introduced but the mark the
[1:32:19] Bible says the first time Jesus was
[1:32:20] introduced to this world when he came
[1:32:23] John said he is the Lamb of God that
[1:32:27] taketh away the sin of the world look
[1:32:30] how he's introduced a man that could
[1:32:32] take away sin when he comes into this
[1:32:35] world no long no longer it wasn't that
[1:32:37] he was that sin was taken out of the
[1:32:39] world brother Mark but Satan's kingdom
[1:32:40] is still full of sin but he took the
[1:32:43] headship of sin off of every believer he
[1:32:45] took the bondage of sin away from you
[1:32:49] that you could freely display the token
[1:32:52] of Jesus Christ Paul said know this our
[1:32:55] old man is crucified with him that the
[1:32:57] body of sin might be destroyed
[1:33:00] henceforth we should not serve sin in
[1:33:02] other word we're not a he that is dead
[1:33:05] is freed from it we don't a servant
[1:33:07] means one that attends to or gives
[1:33:10] respect to a superior he said but we no
[1:33:12] longer serve sin in other words it's no
[1:33:15] longer our Superior it's no longer our
[1:33:18] headship it no longer governs your
[1:33:21] life Paul said but when you're dead in
[1:33:23] Christ
[1:33:24] see to be to serve sin would be to
[1:33:27] accept its Authority but when Christ
[1:33:29] came he took away its
[1:33:31] Authority he took the power of sin away
[1:33:34] the influence of sin out of our life
[1:33:36] where John could write it he said he
[1:33:38] that committeth sins of the devil for
[1:33:40] the devil sined from the beginning but
[1:33:41] for this purpose the Son of God was
[1:33:43] manifested that he might destroy the
[1:33:45] works of the devil and whoever is born
[1:33:48] of God does not commit sin for God's
[1:33:50] seed remaineth in him I is't that
[1:33:53] something Brother David you can't even
[1:33:54] do it it was the source of power that
[1:33:58] Satan held over our
[1:34:01] lives sin in order in order to remove it
[1:34:03] you said well what would God have to do
[1:34:05] well you'd have to take the power away
[1:34:06] from it said well where's its power can
[1:34:08] I tell you where the power is the power
[1:34:10] of sin the Bible says is the strength of
[1:34:13] sin is in the law so when Christ came
[1:34:17] realize the power that sin held over you
[1:34:19] was in the law that God made he said but
[1:34:21] when Christ came Romans 8:2 that the the
[1:34:23] law of the spirit of life in Christ
[1:34:25] Jesus has made me free from the law of
[1:34:28] sin and death the very thing that had
[1:34:31] you bound said but God sent a new law
[1:34:34] and it made you free from it we died to
[1:34:36] our flesh we surrendered to God he said
[1:34:40] then don't let sin Reign Over you any
[1:34:43] longer don't let it rule over you as a
[1:34:46] king over your life I know we we think
[1:34:49] we're big men and women but we're being
[1:34:52] ruled
[1:34:54] Whom Shall you serve I remember the
[1:34:56] words of Joshua when he said that he
[1:34:58] said as for me in my house we will serve
[1:35:01] the
[1:35:02] Lord I say don't let sin rule over you
[1:35:06] as a king that you would obey the lust
[1:35:08] of it but do as Paul said he said sin
[1:35:11] shall not have dominion over you see
[1:35:13] it's a desire I wonder if you just bow
[1:35:15] your heads with me this morning maybe
[1:35:17] there's somebody say brother Matt I have
[1:35:19] a desire to take that out of my life I
[1:35:23] have a desire ire to be free from sin I
[1:35:25] have a desire in my heart it it's deep
[1:35:28] down in there somewhere God bless you
[1:35:29] brother sister Lord bless you being
[1:35:31] honest I have a desire in my heart to be
[1:35:34] freed from sin but friends but when the
[1:35:36] desire becomes a promise it changes the
[1:35:40] view Paul said sin shall not have
[1:35:43] dominion over you for you're no longer
[1:35:45] under the law but you're under grace
[1:35:48] it's a promise of God and now being made
[1:35:52] free from sin you become Servants of God
[1:35:56] don't go back to Servant sin but serve
[1:35:59] God friends your desire is a promise of
[1:36:03] God the very thing that's on your heart
[1:36:06] say Lord I I just want to be right with
[1:36:08] God I want to find my place I want to
[1:36:11] find my purpose what has God for me in
[1:36:13] this life you know we I I don't know
[1:36:15] your life many of you been been from
[1:36:18] many places lived in other states and
[1:36:20] countries and places that you've been
[1:36:22] and came from and things you've gone
[1:36:23] through but God knows and he knows that
[1:36:26] in your heart there's been a longing and
[1:36:28] desire to serve God maybe as a Young Man
[1:36:31] whenever it was it was burning it was on
[1:36:32] fire and there was something there but
[1:36:35] because of what people have done and
[1:36:37] maybe people have said maybe even
[1:36:39] ministers things that have taken place
[1:36:41] that would cause you to lose faith in
[1:36:43] the very God that created
[1:36:45] you but you realize that today that God
[1:36:48] would send a messenger to speak to your
[1:36:51] heart and to say What is your
[1:36:54] desire there's the Judgment that's
[1:36:56] coming to this world said but I'll spare
[1:36:59] all those that believe what's the desire
[1:37:02] of your heart brother man I don't want
[1:37:04] to serve sin I want to serve the
[1:37:07] Lord said whenever Joshua came to her
[1:37:10] notice this she didn't go back to her
[1:37:12] old life she reached out and she took a
[1:37:15] hold of the promise of God and she
[1:37:18] believed it I wonder how many as you
[1:37:20] stand to your feet tonight or this
[1:37:22] morning you say brother Matt I want to
[1:37:24] that's what I want to do I want to
[1:37:26] display the promise of God maybe just
[1:37:29] lift your hands say Lord let me put it
[1:37:30] on display this morning God the very
[1:37:33] change that you made in my life let me
[1:37:35] let me display it let me let me as I as
[1:37:38] I speak to you this morning God let that
[1:37:40] token of the blood of Jesus Christ be
[1:37:43] displayed in my
[1:37:45] life gracious Heavenly Father Lord as
[1:37:48] you see our hands this morning God
[1:37:51] lifted unto you
[1:37:54] God the very desire of our heart Lord
[1:37:56] God is to display a true
[1:37:59] token Lord to display the that scarlet
[1:38:03] cord Lord that of Salvation that youve
[1:38:07] sent to us and God that you have taken
[1:38:10] us and chosen us and forgiven us and
[1:38:13] Lord that you would look over our lives
[1:38:15] and our failures and our past and God
[1:38:18] that you would see something
[1:38:20] greater Lord you would see the desire of
[1:38:22] our heart and the promise that you made
[1:38:25] God and you'd bring it together this
[1:38:28] morning Lord you see everyone Lord God
[1:38:31] you know every
[1:38:32] need God I pray Lord that your mercy had
[1:38:35] overshadow this place this morning God
[1:38:38] as your word has gone forth Lord maybe
[1:38:40] there would be somebody here that don't
[1:38:41] know you God that have a desire to give
[1:38:43] their heart to you this morning God that
[1:38:45] would hear a simple message that would
[1:38:47] go out but Lord they would recognize it
[1:38:49] as a voice of God not looking for some
[1:38:52] great sign but just to believe believe
[1:38:53] the message that you
[1:38:55] sent God I ask you Lord that you would

[1:49:51] Jesus is
[1:49:55] amen you believe that how many Believers
[1:49:56] we have here I believe that God is more
[1:49:59] than able brother Mar he changed us let
[1:50:02] me tell you what happens when God
[1:50:04] changes something in your
[1:50:06] heart you become a different
[1:50:08] person I watched that young man Xavier
[1:50:12] standing there when he was about 13 14
[1:50:14] years old Lord began to deal with his
[1:50:17] life you know what brother the mark
[1:50:19] after a few
[1:50:21] years he he he done like all the rest of
[1:50:24] us do and he ran from the
[1:50:26] Lord but I watched a few months ago when
[1:50:29] God got a hold of
[1:50:30] him and any of you that's near to him
[1:50:33] knows this is a fact that he's not the
[1:50:34] same man that he used to be when God
[1:50:37] gets a hold of you it changes who you
[1:50:39] are and I tell him I'm proud of you for
[1:50:43] standing upon the word of God I'm proud
[1:50:45] of you for taking a stand upon on God's
[1:50:47] word in the face of adversity and
[1:50:50] friends that would forsake you make fun
[1:50:53] of you and mock you that You' stand for
[1:50:56] truth that's that's a God sent man those
[1:50:59] are God called men that'll stand on
[1:51:02] God's
[1:51:05] word you ain't the same man that you
[1:51:07] used to be let me tell you what the
[1:51:10] Bible says when when that when
[1:51:12] Rahab came out of her
[1:51:15] house brother Mark she didn't go back to
[1:51:17] being a
[1:51:20] harlot Brother David she didn't go back
[1:51:22] to the old life but that little what
[1:51:25] they called a harlot she went out and
[1:51:28] she met a Jewish
[1:51:30] Prince and she gave her heart to him
[1:51:33] something that she had never done she'd
[1:51:35] gave her body away but she' never gave
[1:51:37] her heart to
[1:51:38] anybody and she gave her heart to this
[1:51:40] Jewish
[1:51:42] Prince said they went back and he took
[1:51:44] his bride back to Bethlehem a settling
[1:51:47] down place to live where there was
[1:51:48] plenty of bread and through this great
[1:51:51] Romance and her Obedience of
[1:51:54] Faith they brought forth
[1:51:57] Boaz from one child generation to the
[1:52:00] next all the way down to Joseph the man
[1:52:02] that would look over and raise the baby
[1:52:05] and the boy Jesus Christ isn't it
[1:52:09] something that God would take aive and
[1:52:11] use it for such a great purpose friends
[1:52:14] you may have been using it for something
[1:52:15] else but you let the Lord get a hold of
[1:52:18] you this morning it'll change what you
[1:52:20] use your life for
[1:52:22] said it changed her what a what a
[1:52:24] romance that's what's happened to us
[1:52:27] this morning for the market it's a great
[1:52:29] Romance of a Jewish prince and a gentile
[1:52:33] bride Christ Jesus here when we were
[1:52:36] unworthy but he comeing he called us out
[1:52:39] of this condition here when we had built
[1:52:42] up all kinds of walls and denominations
[1:52:44] and systems and religious beliefs to
[1:52:47] keep people away from him but he came
[1:52:49] through all of it he tore down every
[1:52:51] wall and he found us right in our
[1:52:53] condition and we're never going back to
[1:52:56] that again he called you out by your own
[1:52:59] name I love what Joshua said he said go
[1:53:03] in and take every man it's all been
[1:53:05] cursed except the house of
[1:53:08] Rahab can you imagine that she was an
[1:53:11] unknown human nobody knew who she was an
[1:53:15] ill- fign woman there ain't nobody in
[1:53:17] the world she had she had no reputation
[1:53:19] of great but the greatest man that
[1:53:21] walked on Earth in those days knew her
[1:53:24] name when he walked in he said go by the
[1:53:28] way of rahab's house and bring her and
[1:53:31] all of her house out everything else is
[1:53:34] cursed but everything she has is
[1:53:37] blessed isn't it something when the Holy
[1:53:41] Ghost knows your
[1:53:42] name that he can go into your house and
[1:53:45] Brother David in the middle of the night
[1:53:46] when everything's all mixed up and he
[1:53:48] can call you out by
[1:53:50] name but the man he knew knew
[1:53:53] you when you didn't know him and when
[1:53:56] you had no desire to serve him but he
[1:53:59] knew
