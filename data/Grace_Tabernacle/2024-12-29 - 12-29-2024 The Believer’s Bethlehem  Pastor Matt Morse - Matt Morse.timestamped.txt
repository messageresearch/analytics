[29:35] about the power of God and how God can
[29:37] turn things around in just a moment and

[47:20] that's done and said in Jesus name we
[47:23] pray amen amen how many Say Amen
[47:27] to that that's the desire of our heart
[47:29] amen so we just want to invite you to
[47:32] the scripture we're going to read out of
[47:33] the Book of Luke in the second chapter
[47:35] and we'll start in the eth verse and uh
[47:39] we'll go through the 15th verse and I
[47:42] just had heard this uh on U on uh last
[47:46] Wednesday night brother brother Joe uh
[47:49] was actually reading this scripture and
[47:51] when he read it something just stood out
[47:53] to me and the Lord had put it on my
[47:55] heart so I thought I'll uh be able to
[47:57] come uh this morning and bring that to
[47:59] the church so uh just just look forward
[48:02] to what uh God can show us in it amen do
[48:05] you still believe that God can take his
[48:06] word and uh he can show us things in his
[48:09] word that we have need of and he's
[48:11] certainly that kind of a god this
[48:13] morning and so we just want to rely on
[48:15] him to bring something out of the word
[48:17] that would be edifying uh to the church
[48:19] so we're going to read out of Luke in
[48:21] the 2 chapter and here in the eth verse
[48:26] and the Bible says that and there were
[48:29] in the same country shepherds abiding in
[48:32] the field keeping watch over their flock
[48:34] by night and lo the angel of the Lord
[48:36] Came Upon them and the glory of the Lord
[48:38] Shone round about them and they were
[48:40] sore afraid and the angel said unto them
[48:43] fear not for for behold I bring to you
[48:47] good tidings of great joy which shall be
[48:50] to all people for unto you is Born This
[48:53] Day in the city of David a savior which
[48:55] is called the L Christ the Lord and this
[48:58] shall be a sign unto you you shall find
[49:00] the Babe wrapped in swaddling clothes
[49:02] lying in a manger and suddenly there was
[49:04] the Angel With An Angel a multitude of
[49:07] heavenly hosts praising God and saying
[49:09] glory to God in the highest and and
[49:13] peace on Earth and on Earth peace and
[49:16] Good Will toward men and it came to pass
[49:19] as the Angels were gone away from them
[49:21] into heaven that the shepherd said one
[49:24] to another let us now go even unto
[49:27] Bethlehem and see this thing which has
[49:30] come to pass which the Lord hath made
[49:33] known unto us and I'll just ask the Lord
[49:36] to add his Blessing to the reading of
[49:37] the word this morning and from that
[49:39] scripture I would like to speak on a
[49:41] subject of the believer's Bethlehem the
[49:44] believer's Bethlehem and as you're
[49:46] seated I would like to read out of the
[49:48] book of Psalms the 42nd chapter in the
[49:51] second verse and David said my soul
[49:53] thirsteth for God for the Living God for
[49:56] when shall I come and appear before God
[50:00] what a question David asked when shall I
[50:02] come and appear before God you know
[50:04] through the Bible uh many times we see
[50:06] this question that is asked in several
[50:08] places where can I find him and how can
[50:11] I see him and where can I meet him and
[50:14] uh this is what David asked when shall
[50:16] be the time that I can come and I can
[50:17] appear before God and you know I thought
[50:20] about in the Old Testament in the days
[50:21] of Abraham and uh when Abraham met with
[50:24] God do you realize that when Abraham
[50:26] talked with God it was almost on a daily
[50:28] basis and back uh in in those days they
[50:31] would go and Abraham he would uh on on
[50:33] many occasions he would meet with God
[50:35] and he would talk with God and uh even
[50:37] when he would go into the land of gerar
[50:39] remember uh the king AMC which was a
[50:41] Philistine King the Bible says that the
[50:43] Lord was in the camp of ailec and here
[50:46] he was a Philistine but yet still God
[50:48] was present there he was in the he was
[50:50] in the camp of the Philistine he was in
[50:52] the camp of Abraham and where wherever
[50:54] they went it seemed like God was always
[50:56] there it was was the it was just a way
[50:58] that or a place they could always meet
[50:59] God in other words it was a very common
[51:02] thing to be in the presence of the Lord
[51:03] and in in those days it was certainly a
[51:06] common thing it was common among men
[51:08] 3,000 years ago brother Mark it was a
[51:10] very common thing for men to meet God
[51:12] you could almost meet God anywhere you
[51:14] notice the Bible said Abraham where when
[51:16] he went into the Into the Wilderness God
[51:18] was there when he was at his home God
[51:20] was there when he was with his family
[51:21] God was there when he went into a
[51:23] Strange Land God was there when he went
[51:25] up in the mountain he met with God when
[51:26] he went down in the valley he met with
[51:28] God it seemed like that God was always
[51:30] there it was always a place to be able
[51:32] to meet God and and you know the prophet
[51:34] say but then it was a common thing but
[51:36] they you know but today it's different
[51:38] but why don't people meet him today he
[51:40] said there's more people than there ever
[51:42] was there's tens of thousands and
[51:43] millions of more people than there ever
[51:46] has been like there was years ago but
[51:48] there's something about it but today God
[51:50] has become some ancient something that
[51:52] is just talked about he's some ancient
[51:55] history so you see that people today
[51:57] they don't go meet God in person like
[51:59] they did many years ago here some 3,000
[52:01] years ago where they used to but today
[52:03] it's not common for a man to go meet God
[52:06] if a man talks about it why you'd make
[52:08] fun of him if a man said he went and met
[52:10] god well people would call him a crazy
[52:12] person or somebody that had lost his
[52:13] mind it's uncommon to the world today
[52:16] for a man to meet God you know I thought
[52:18] about this here was the desire of David
[52:20] when can I come and I can sit down in
[52:23] his presence when can I be found in the
[52:24] presence of God and you realize that
[52:26] this very desire that David had was a
[52:29] desire that was passed on from
[52:30] generation to generation and and we see
[52:33] when Christ came to the Earth that there
[52:34] were many in that day that was seeking
[52:36] the coming of a messiah they were
[52:38] waiting on his coming and and these were
[52:40] a people y'all y' you'll just had to get
[52:42] with me this morning it's what the lord
[52:43] gave me but but it was a people that
[52:45] knew the law of the prophets here was a
[52:47] people that were they were expecting
[52:49] something how many expecting something
[52:51] this morning so here because they were
[52:53] expecting something they knew the
[52:54] prophecies that was concerning this
[52:56] coming they knew they knew in every age
[52:58] they knew generation after generation
[53:00] they had awaited for his arrival and
[53:02] though and and all of a sudden they
[53:04] finally come to the age when no longer
[53:07] was it a prophecy but it was the age of
[53:08] fulfillment and no longer was it an age
[53:10] of question but then come the age of the
[53:12] answer so all the the age of wondering
[53:15] of When shall I meet him when shall I
[53:16] see him when shall he come all of a
[53:18] sudden here was a people that the answer
[53:21] to the question had arrived in their
[53:23] City I thought my that's what we need
[53:25] this morning we need the answer answer
[53:26] to the question to arrive in our city
[53:29] and and the Bible says but here here he
[53:31] would come and they were expecting him
[53:32] to come but I want to notice this this
[53:34] morning just as I lay a foundation that
[53:37] each time you find Jesus introduced in
[53:40] the Bible there's always an invitation
[53:43] for you to come and see him for yourself
[53:46] I got to think about this little thought
[53:47] this morning of of how that many times
[53:49] as he was introduced you remember when
[53:51] Jesus went down into Galilee and the
[53:53] Bible said he was calling his disciples
[53:55] and Andrew and
[53:57] and and uh in in in in John and as he
[53:59] began to call his disciples and he came
[54:02] to Phillip and he told philli come and
[54:03] follow me and the Bible says that Philip
[54:05] went out and he began to talk to
[54:07] Nathaniel And he said Nathaniel come and
[54:09] see the one that that the Moses and the
[54:11] prophets had spoke of and he he's the
[54:13] one that was written about in the in the
[54:15] laws of Moses his name is Jesus of
[54:17] Nazareth he's the son of Joseph he's the
[54:19] Messiah the one that we long for and and
[54:22] Nathaniel said well how can anything
[54:24] good ever come out of Nazareth and
[54:26] notice how that Philip replied to
[54:29] Nathaniel he said just come and see now
[54:33] what a what three words that they have a
[54:35] lot of meaning he said just come and see
[54:37] how can this be God he said well come
[54:39] and see how can anything good come out
[54:41] of Nazareth he said well just come and
[54:43] see remember when Jesus he came to the
[54:45] woman at the well remember when he went
[54:47] down that little Samaritan woman and as
[54:49] he began to speak to her and you notice
[54:51] the gift or the or or or or the sign of
[54:53] the Messiah begin to speak out of him
[54:55] and he he told her to go get her
[54:57] husbands and she said I don't have any
[54:59] husbands he said woman you spoke the
[55:01] truth he said for you've had five
[55:02] husbands and the one that you have now
[55:04] it's not your own and all of the sudden
[55:06] her eyes came open to that Messiah sign
[55:09] the one that would be able to discern
[55:10] her heart and friends you may as well
[55:12] make a note of it when you see that sign
[55:14] it is the sign of the Messiah of the of
[55:16] the Angel of the Lord being able to see
[55:18] something in somebody's life that you
[55:20] didn't know was there or you hadn't told
[55:22] anybody about it there was no way for
[55:24] him to know it it was a messiah sign
[55:26] that that she saw sitting on the side of
[55:27] the well and the Bible says that
[55:29] whenever she saw that she said I know
[55:32] that when the Messiah comes he would do
[55:34] these things he would know the desire of
[55:36] our heart he would tell us all things he
[55:38] he would know the things that are in our
[55:39] mind that we haven't even spoke of and
[55:41] Jesus said I that speaks unto thee am he
[55:45] and you know what the Bible said the
[55:46] Bible says she threw down her water pot
[55:48] and she went running into the city and
[55:50] what was her message her message was
[55:53] come and see come and see a man that
[55:56] have told me all the things in my heart
[55:58] come and see a man that has fulfilled
[56:00] the scripture you notice it was the same
[56:02] message and and you you realize that
[56:04] notice the Bible says that they went out
[56:06] of the city and they came unto him you
[56:08] say well why would they go to him
[56:10] because you realize that this is the
[56:12] draw of our human nature this is this is
[56:14] as part of our nature is that we want to
[56:17] see it for oursel we I don't want to
[56:18] take somebody else's word for but I want
[56:20] to see how many testify that I I want to
[56:23] see God for myself I I want to see him
[56:25] move for myself I want to see a
[56:27] supernatural for myself I want to see a
[56:29] move of God for myself I want to see a
[56:31] Revival for myself I don't want to see
[56:33] something of somebody else's day but let
[56:35] me see it for myself so here here the
[56:38] Bible says come and see and then they
[56:40] went to see the very thing that she was
[56:42] speaking of and when they seen they came
[56:44] out believing you see this same thing in
[56:46] Mary Magdalene and Mary when they came
[56:48] to the seler after the burial of Jesus
[56:50] the Bible said they found an angel that
[56:52] was sitting on a stone that once was the
[56:54] door or the seal over the tomb where
[56:57] Jesus's dead body lay but there here
[57:00] whenever Mary Magdalene and they came to
[57:01] the tomb that day no longer was there a
[57:03] dead body but the tomb the door had been
[57:06] rolled away the stone had been rolled
[57:08] away and sitting on the stone was an
[57:10] angel of the Lord and he said fear not
[57:12] for that which you seek he's not here
[57:15] but he is risen and come and see the
[57:18] place where he lay notice it's the same
[57:21] message all along it's com and see now
[57:23] notice in order in order for it to uh to
[57:26] to for you to be able to see it this
[57:27] morning notice the message was not just
[57:30] see but the message was to come and see
[57:33] in other words there there's an action
[57:35] in order for you to see there's an
[57:37] action of getting out of where you are
[57:39] whenever Philip told Nathaniel he said
[57:41] come and see in other words you can't
[57:42] sit here and see what I'm talking about
[57:45] when the woman at the well she said come
[57:46] and see in other words you can't stay in
[57:48] Samaria but you got to go down to the
[57:50] same well and meet the same one that I'm
[57:53] there that you can see that he's the
[57:54] Messiah and now he the Angel of the Lord
[57:57] he said come and see the place where he
[57:59] lay oh friends let me tell you I thought
[58:01] this is so powerful this word come and
[58:03] see notice it's used in two different
[58:05] ways one it was used at an in as an
[58:08] invitation to show you where Jesus was
[58:11] not at and then in the other place it
[58:14] was used as an invitation to show you
[58:16] where he was so here this message of
[58:18] come and see it'll show you come and see
[58:21] where this is not God come and see that
[58:23] God ain't here come and see that he's
[58:25] not in this but then turn around and
[58:27] come and see but this is the savior come
[58:29] and see this is the work of the Messiah
[58:31] come and see this is a messiah sign so
[58:33] it's the same message that showed you
[58:35] where Jesus wasn't is the same message
[58:38] that shows you where he was says so come
[58:41] and see the place where he laid so but
[58:43] notice but in order what the Bible is
[58:45] showing us is in order to see him you
[58:47] have to come to a certain place right is
[58:50] that established in order to see him how
[58:51] many say Amen in order to see him you
[58:54] have to come to a certain place in other
[58:56] words you have to get out of where you
[58:58] are if you want to see God you got to
[58:59] move a little bit if you want to see God
[59:01] you got to get out of the condition that
[59:03] you're in if you want to see God you got
[59:04] to pick yourself up and you got to take
[59:06] a few steps and go to the place that
[59:08] where God is friends let me tell you if
[59:10] there ever was a way to see God then
[59:12] there still is if there was a way to
[59:14] appear before God then there still is
[59:16] somebody say Amen if there ever anybody
[59:19] have a testimony there's a way to see
[59:20] God here this morning but let me tell
[59:22] you something that goes much deeper than
[59:24] the surface don't let this pass You by
[59:26] but you can only see God as he is if you
[59:31] want to see God you must see him as he
[59:34] is for the Bible would say in the days
[59:36] of the shepherd they saw him as a baby
[59:38] in a Manger in the days of the woman at
[59:40] the well she saw him as a man that was
[59:42] in his 30s in the days of Moses he saw
[59:44] him as a pillar of fire and how did the
[59:46] people see him they saw him in Moses and
[59:49] when they saw Moses they saw God see if
[59:51] you want to see God you must see God as
[59:54] he is Daniel when he went down the the
[59:56] Lion's Den it was a the angel of the
[59:58] Lord that came down that protected him
[59:59] when Ezekiel saw him he was a wheel in
[1:00:01] the middle of a wheel when Abraham met
[1:00:03] him he was mecdc that met him on the
[1:00:05] road and he sat down and had Feast with
[1:00:07] him if you want to see God you have to
[1:00:09] see him as he is so today if you want to
[1:00:13] see him you have to go to where God is
[1:00:15] and you have to meet God as God is I
[1:00:17] thought today of how that that that
[1:00:19] people have done so much to prepare a
[1:00:21] place where that you and I can go meet
[1:00:23] God I thought of the millions of dollars
[1:00:25] and the money that people have spent
[1:00:27] just to make a place where that you can
[1:00:29] fulfill the desire of David and that you
[1:00:32] can appear before God you realize that
[1:00:34] there's there's many places on Earth
[1:00:36] that that claim to have that power in
[1:00:38] order for you to be able to appear
[1:00:39] before God I was looking at some I
[1:00:41] thought I'd share with you this morning
[1:00:43] but you realize in in in over in Mount
[1:00:45] Si there's there's a church called the
[1:00:47] St Catherine's Monastery and in the St
[1:00:50] Katherine's Monastery you'll actually
[1:00:51] find you'll actually find that there uh
[1:00:54] that inside the monastery is a
[1:00:56] descendant of the actual burning bush
[1:00:59] the brambo bush that that was on Mount
[1:01:01] Si and according to in according to
[1:01:03] their teaching in Egypt it was actually
[1:01:05] the same Bush and it was protected
[1:01:07] through the the ages and they're a long
[1:01:09] living Bush several centuries that they
[1:01:10] even live but this is an offspring of
[1:01:13] the very same Bush that came off Mount
[1:01:15] Si that Moses came before and here today
[1:01:18] you can go down into into the St
[1:01:20] Katherine's Monastery you can take a
[1:01:22] tour you can pay a few dollars and you
[1:01:23] can go in and you know many go and say
[1:01:26] it's a nice place I think it would be a
[1:01:27] nice place to go visit brother Wesley
[1:01:29] just to see uh what they what they've
[1:01:31] done in a place where Moses actually
[1:01:33] walked up up on the mountain but but see
[1:01:35] but then there's other people that go
[1:01:37] there and you see that bush what you
[1:01:38] can't see is though people those people
[1:01:41] that go there before many of them when
[1:01:42] they come before that bush they'll
[1:01:44] actually take their shoes off because
[1:01:46] they're walking on Holy Ground and here
[1:01:48] after all it's the same Bush that
[1:01:49] descended so they'll take their shoes
[1:01:51] off and they walk before the bush why
[1:01:53] because they're trying to find a place
[1:01:55] that they can appear before God and
[1:01:57] after all it was the same Bush it was
[1:01:59] transplanted from the mountain and built
[1:02:01] in this Monastery to protect it I
[1:02:03] thought there's many places you can go
[1:02:05] you know you can leave there and you can
[1:02:06] Journey just for a few miles and you can
[1:02:08] go over to the Red Sea and there's many
[1:02:10] places along the Red Sea that claim to
[1:02:13] be the very place that God came down
[1:02:16] look on that on those very waters on
[1:02:17] that that very bank that God came down
[1:02:20] where 2 million people were lined up by
[1:02:22] that mountain and God parted those
[1:02:24] Waters where 2 million people could walk
[1:02:26] across it and many more could walk
[1:02:28] across it on dry Trot and you know there
[1:02:31] there's there's many places and signs
[1:02:32] along that Red Sea that you can go down
[1:02:34] and you can say this is where God parted
[1:02:36] the waters I thought my what I thought
[1:02:38] it would be to walk down the red sea sea
[1:02:40] and say that's where God opened up the
[1:02:41] water What a Mighty thing that God done
[1:02:44] because it was a work that God done but
[1:02:45] you can walk in that very place you know
[1:02:48] you can go over into palast in Into the
[1:02:51] City of Bethlehem and in this city
[1:02:53] there's what's called The Church of the
[1:02:55] nativity and I I don't know if you ever
[1:02:56] looked at this place but it's quite it's
[1:02:58] quite fascinating what's there but
[1:03:00] actually according uh to to to the
[1:03:03] church history it's actually considered
[1:03:06] the holiest place in all of Christianity
[1:03:08] in the Church of the Nativity because in
[1:03:10] this place there's actually a cave below
[1:03:13] the church and in the cave which what
[1:03:15] they would show was a place where
[1:03:16] animals were kept and a Manger where
[1:03:18] animals were kept and there's a silver
[1:03:20] star on the ground where they say that
[1:03:22] today it was the very place that Mary
[1:03:25] gave birth to Jesus and you can go today
[1:03:27] and and go into the church and take a
[1:03:29] tour and walk down and stand and take
[1:03:32] photos on the very place where Jesus was
[1:03:34] born I thought my what a place here they
[1:03:36] built the church over and you know what
[1:03:38] a place to be able to go to see the same
[1:03:40] spot that Jesus was born but but you
[1:03:42] know that there's there's many other
[1:03:43] places there there's the Church of
[1:03:45] Jacob's Well that's over in nabul that's
[1:03:47] in the that's the modern day shech and
[1:03:49] and you know if you go inside that
[1:03:51] church that actually they never moved
[1:03:52] the well the well is still there
[1:03:54] remember when Jacob came back and he
[1:03:56] went into the land of shech and he made
[1:03:57] an altar before the Lord and as he and
[1:04:00] as he built the the well that that that
[1:04:02] uh that many would drink out of and his
[1:04:04] family and all them would be uh
[1:04:06] sustained from that that they come and
[1:04:08] they built the church around the well to
[1:04:10] protect it and the reason they built it
[1:04:12] is because the sacredness of it it was
[1:04:15] actually a place where Jesus actually
[1:04:17] walked a matter of fact you can go in
[1:04:19] there today and you can sit down on the
[1:04:22] same well that Jesus and that little
[1:04:24] Samaritan woman sat on and you can hear
[1:04:26] they'll sit and they'll read you the
[1:04:28] story of that woman of Samaria and how
[1:04:30] Jesus came to this well and how she
[1:04:32] looked at the well down in it and said
[1:04:34] but here I can draw from it and he said
[1:04:36] if you wanted anything if you really
[1:04:38] wanted something to drink you'd ask me
[1:04:39] to draw and she said well the well is
[1:04:41] deep and you have you can look down in
[1:04:42] the depth of that great well and realize
[1:04:44] what she was speaking of the well is
[1:04:46] deep and you brought nothing to draw
[1:04:48] with you and today you can go sit down
[1:04:50] and you can experience that same place
[1:04:52] and you know that you can leave there
[1:04:54] and you can go over to the the pool of
[1:04:56] Bethesda where the archaeologist today
[1:04:58] Brother David that they've actually
[1:05:00] taken this pool of Bethesda and they dug
[1:05:02] it out and they and they they made it to
[1:05:04] where you can go and you can sit down at
[1:05:06] the pool of Bethesda and here in in
[1:05:09] Jerusalem this was the place that where
[1:05:11] people would go to remember the Bible
[1:05:13] call it it would be the place of Mercy
[1:05:15] or the or the House of Mercy because at
[1:05:17] the pool of Bethesda it had five porches
[1:05:19] remember the significance of the pool is
[1:05:22] that when Jesus went down there that day
[1:05:24] you've read the story in the Bible and
[1:05:25] the Bible said they were sitting around
[1:05:27] the pool those that were blind and
[1:05:30] withered and they were and they were
[1:05:32] they were lame and they couldn't walk
[1:05:34] but every day every time that when it
[1:05:36] came a time of healing that the angel of
[1:05:38] the Lord would come down and he would
[1:05:39] trouble the water and the people that
[1:05:41] sat on those very porches many times
[1:05:44] they would walk down and the first
[1:05:46] person that would go down after the
[1:05:47] water was troubled and they would step
[1:05:49] into that pool they would receive their
[1:05:50] healing this is the place that Jesus
[1:05:52] walked brother Bobby and he walked down
[1:05:54] those very porches today you can walk
[1:05:56] the same path that Jesus walked you can
[1:05:58] stand on the same porch where Jesus
[1:06:00] stood and he looked at that little man
[1:06:02] that was on that that that was that was
[1:06:04] halt from his birth or lame and Jesus
[1:06:07] said he had that infirmity for 38 years
[1:06:09] and the Bible said Jesus knew that he
[1:06:11] had set in that condition for a long
[1:06:13] time and you can go and you can stand in
[1:06:15] that very place where Jesus spoke to him
[1:06:17] and said why won't you go get your
[1:06:18] healing and the man remember that
[1:06:20] conversation that he had he said I can't
[1:06:22] get my healing because every time the
[1:06:23] angel troubles the water somebody gets
[1:06:25] in my way and nobody can take me to the
[1:06:27] water and I can't make it to my healing
[1:06:29] and Jesus looked at him he said arise
[1:06:32] and take up thy bed and walk and the
[1:06:34] Bible says immediately the man St he
[1:06:36] stood and feeling came back to his leg
[1:06:38] he went away testifying and leaping and
[1:06:41] praising God you know you can visit that
[1:06:43] very same place that Jesus had done this
[1:06:45] great miracle you can leave that place
[1:06:48] and go over into the city of japfa which
[1:06:50] was the old day of japa and in this city
[1:06:54] you can find the house of Simon the
[1:06:56] Tanner and you realize that what
[1:06:58] happened at the house of Simon the
[1:06:59] Tanner can I can I just say it I feel
[1:07:01] good this morning but at the the house
[1:07:04] of Simon the Tanner this very house that
[1:07:06] still stands today is the house that
[1:07:09] Peter got his vision that God wasn't
[1:07:11] just a God to the Jews but he was also a
[1:07:14] God to the Gentiles and on the top of
[1:07:16] that very house when they were preparing
[1:07:17] supper on the inside Peter went up on
[1:07:19] the rooftop of that house and he was
[1:07:21] sitting there praying and and seeking
[1:07:23] God and the Bible said as he got hungry
[1:07:25] and they preparing the meal all of a
[1:07:27] sudden he broke into a vision and he saw
[1:07:29] this great sheet come down upon the
[1:07:31] Earth and on that sheet there was
[1:07:32] four-footed beast and fouls of the air
[1:07:35] and the angel of the Lord spoke to him
[1:07:36] he said Peter go kill and eat and Peter
[1:07:39] said I can't eat those things I don't
[1:07:41] eat things that are common I don't eat
[1:07:43] things that are unclean I've always kept
[1:07:45] my body I've always kept my vow and the
[1:07:47] angel of the Lord spoke to him he said
[1:07:49] you don't call something unclean that
[1:07:51] I've called clean you don't call
[1:07:53] something common that I've called uncom
[1:07:55] M he said it's a clean thing I've made
[1:07:57] it clean and the Bible says that Vision
[1:07:59] came to him three times he saw that
[1:08:01] sheet come down and as he came out of
[1:08:03] his vision on that very roof brother
[1:08:05] Wesley as he came out of his vision on
[1:08:07] that rooftop and he begin to walk down
[1:08:09] the stairs they said Peter there's
[1:08:10] somebody here to see you and the spirit
[1:08:12] of the Lord began to speak to him as he
[1:08:14] walked down the stairs of that house and
[1:08:16] when every step he took hear the spirit
[1:08:17] of the Lord speaking to him saying Peter
[1:08:19] now these men I sent unto you do what
[1:08:22] they're asking you to do it ain't some
[1:08:24] trap I send them here I sent him here
[1:08:26] for a purpose and I and I've called you
[1:08:28] to this place for a purpose Peter went
[1:08:30] down and lo and behold there stood three
[1:08:32] Gentiles at that very door and Peter
[1:08:35] walked out them same doors and he stood
[1:08:37] in that same doorway and he began to
[1:08:39] speak to those men and said what do you
[1:08:40] want with me they said our Master
[1:08:42] Cornelius he's had a vision and the Lord
[1:08:45] told him he's a praying man a devout man
[1:08:47] he loves the Lord he gives off he's had
[1:08:49] a vision and the Lord told him to come
[1:08:51] and find Simon Peter in the house of
[1:08:53] Simon the tenner and so we came came
[1:08:55] here to find you to come back to our
[1:08:57] house so Peter said the Lord told me to
[1:08:59] go brother Wesley he went down and
[1:09:01] because of the new revelation that Peter
[1:09:03] had he began to speak to them they said
[1:09:05] we don't know what to tell you we're
[1:09:06] just a bunch of old Gentiles and all I
[1:09:08] know is the Lord told us to tell you to
[1:09:11] come here and speak to us and Peter said
[1:09:13] let me tell you the Revelation that I
[1:09:14] have he said I know one thing that I
[1:09:17] have perceived that God is no respector
[1:09:20] of persons y'all may not be Jews there
[1:09:22] was a few days ago I wouldn't be caught
[1:09:24] dead in your house but on the rooftop of
[1:09:26] the House of Simon the Tanner I got a
[1:09:28] revelation that God is not only the god
[1:09:30] of the Jews but he's the god of the
[1:09:33] Gentiles and he said and I I perceive
[1:09:35] that God's no respector of persons but
[1:09:37] in every nation that fearth him and
[1:09:39] worketh righteousness is accepted with
[1:09:42] him that's the message that Peter
[1:09:44] preached unto him you can go down and
[1:09:46] look at the same place the Gateway that
[1:09:48] Peter stood in but you realize butar
[1:09:50] that ain't all you can go down to
[1:09:52] Jerusalem today and there's a small
[1:09:54] structure inside the Church of the Holy
[1:09:57] SRE I they' remodeled it a few years ago
[1:10:00] I I remember watching when they were I
[1:10:02] think it was 2016 or 17 they were doing
[1:10:04] the remodel and the reason we were
[1:10:06] watched it is because it was the first
[1:10:07] time in centuries that you could
[1:10:09] actually see in the edicule which is the
[1:10:11] little house inside the church you could
[1:10:13] actually see in the edicule to the first
[1:10:15] house that was built you realize that
[1:10:17] house is actually that or that little
[1:10:19] Temple is a temple within a temple and
[1:10:21] inside that Temple is another Temple an
[1:10:24] ancient Temple that that the the old
[1:10:26] concrete walls that they had built it in
[1:10:28] and inside that old concrete walls that
[1:10:30] they had built it in actually has the
[1:10:32] remnants of the cave that Jesus was
[1:10:35] buried in the Tomb of Jesus and here
[1:10:39] inside of it it shows the remnants of it
[1:10:41] you can go in now you can't see it they
[1:10:43] keep it buried in there because they
[1:10:44] don't ever want it to lose its value and
[1:10:46] today they go have daily mass in this
[1:10:48] Temple walking around the tomb or or the
[1:10:51] Tomb of the Tomb of the tomb where Jesus
[1:10:53] is and they walk around it and they and
[1:10:55] they worship him it's a place of worship
[1:10:57] to think of this place where Jesus was
[1:10:59] and I thought you know my you know the
[1:11:01] greatest part about the Tomb of Jesus
[1:11:03] brother Wesley is that you won't find
[1:11:05] Jesus there you know the greatest part
[1:11:08] of it is there's no bones in there
[1:11:10] there's no remnants of him you can have
[1:11:12] worship there all you want to but Jesus
[1:11:14] ain't there you know the greatest part
[1:11:16] of the House of of Simon the tenner you
[1:11:18] can go there but that ain't the place
[1:11:20] that you go to meet God you know the
[1:11:21] great part of going to the pool of
[1:11:23] Bethesda but Mar it ain't the place to
[1:11:25] meet God it's a great place to go it's a
[1:11:28] great place to see the things that God
[1:11:29] done but that ain't a place to meet God
[1:11:32] and that tomb ain't a place to meet God
[1:11:34] because he ain't in no tomb let me tell
[1:11:36] you friend there's many religions around
[1:11:38] the world you can go to the Mecca and
[1:11:39] Saudi Arabia you can find the tomb of
[1:11:41] Muhammad and his body's laying on the
[1:11:43] inside you can go all over Asia and you
[1:11:45] can find tombs that are filled with the
[1:11:47] ashes of Buddha and all of Buddha ISM
[1:11:49] where they had burned his body and
[1:11:51] spread his ashes through churches around
[1:11:53] the world where people can still go
[1:11:54] worship Him but when you go to Jerusalem
[1:11:56] to the Tomb of Jesus Christ you'll never
[1:11:59] find a bone you'll never find a body
[1:12:01] you'll never find a Remnant because we
[1:12:03] have a Jesus a God a savior that's alive
[1:12:06] and well you won't find him buried in a
[1:12:09] tomb you won't find him on the bank of a
[1:12:11] river somewhere he's prophet of God said
[1:12:14] don't you think it's a wonderful thing
[1:12:15] this morning to know that our Christian
[1:12:17] religion is the only religion that can
[1:12:20] prove that our savior is still alive
[1:12:24] Hallelujah I said our savior is still
[1:12:27] alive hundreds of religions around the
[1:12:29] world but we have a god that is still
[1:12:31] alive and well we serve a Jesus a savior
[1:12:34] a prophet that came to the Earth and
[1:12:36] he's still walking I ain't going to no
[1:12:38] dead man's tomb looking for God people
[1:12:40] today they're so lost going to a tomb of
[1:12:42] a man trying to find God waiting on him
[1:12:44] to resurrect where they could find God
[1:12:46] I've already found God in the place to
[1:12:48] meet God and it ain't in a dead man's
[1:12:51] tomb do you want to meet God said you
[1:12:54] got to go find a place where you can
[1:12:55] meet him Buddha died 19 or 2500 years
[1:12:59] ago Muhammad died 1900 years ago and
[1:13:02] they still go they still go to their
[1:13:03] tombs to worship them but listen what
[1:13:05] our Jesus said he said a little while
[1:13:08] this world will see me no more but you
[1:13:10] shall see me even the spirit of Truth
[1:13:13] whom the world cannot receive because it
[1:13:15] seeth him not neither do they know him
[1:13:18] but you know him for he dwelleth with
[1:13:21] you and he shall be in you you know why
[1:13:23] we ain't going everywhere looking for
[1:13:24] God because that ain't where he said
[1:13:26] he'd be he said I will not leave you
[1:13:28] comfortless but I glory to God Oh Glory
[1:13:31] he said I will not leave you comfortless
[1:13:33] but I will come to
[1:13:36] you everybody's going everywhere looking
[1:13:38] for God but Jesus said I will not leave
[1:13:40] you comfortless for I will come to
[1:13:43] you wherever you are he said I'll come
[1:13:46] to you because I live you shall live
[1:13:50] also and at that day you shall know that
[1:13:52] I am in my father and you are in me and
[1:13:55] I am in you you remember the disciples
[1:13:57] when Jesus spoke these words they said
[1:13:59] we're troubled at this saying what do
[1:14:02] you mean what what do you mean that a
[1:14:04] little while we won't see you in a
[1:14:05] little while we'll see you again how how
[1:14:08] how does this mean the Bible say Jesus
[1:14:09] knew what they were asking in their
[1:14:10] heart he said you want to know why I
[1:14:12] said a little while the world wouldn't
[1:14:13] see me but you'll see me in a little
[1:14:15] while he said let me explain it to you
[1:14:17] he said verily I say unto you that you
[1:14:19] shall weep and the world will be
[1:14:20] rejoicing he said but then there will
[1:14:22] come a time think about it you're going
[1:14:24] to be weeping
[1:14:25] you're going to come through a time of
[1:14:27] great sorrow while the world rejoices he
[1:14:29] said but then there will come a time
[1:14:32] that the world will rejoice no longer
[1:14:34] but you shall rejoice in other words
[1:14:36] your sorrow will be turned into Joy he
[1:14:39] said you'll be sorrowful but it'll be
[1:14:41] turned into great joy then he uses the
[1:14:43] type of a woman that was given birth he
[1:14:45] says see for a woman that would that
[1:14:46] would go into childbirth she would
[1:14:48] travail in their child birth and pain
[1:14:50] and anguish he said but whenever the man
[1:14:52] is born then the joy is greater than the
[1:14:55] pain and about and Jesus said and no
[1:14:57] longer will she even remember the pain
[1:15:00] because the joy is greater than the pain
[1:15:02] oh see there's many that are in the
[1:15:04] middle of a birth and it's a painful
[1:15:06] thing to think of a new birth but Jesus
[1:15:08] said but that sorrow only lasts for a
[1:15:10] little while I find many people in that
[1:15:12] place this morning that are in the
[1:15:13] process of a new birth and it's a
[1:15:15] painful place and it's a place of great
[1:15:17] sorrow he said but whenever the child is
[1:15:20] born the joy is greater than the pain
[1:15:22] ever
[1:15:23] was rejoice in the sorrow but Bob joy
[1:15:26] joy joy cometh in the morning he said
[1:15:29] therefore you have sorrow but I will see
[1:15:31] you again and when I see you again your
[1:15:33] heart shall rejoice for no man can take
[1:15:36] it from you I'm going to give you a joy
[1:15:38] that no man can take away when you get
[1:15:40] through this place of Sorrow my isn't
[1:15:41] that a good thought this morning that
[1:15:43] the joy is greater than the pain I don't
[1:15:45] know what you're going through this
[1:15:46] morning but I know what Jesus said
[1:15:48] there's only a certain time of sorrow
[1:15:50] but then Joy follows sorrow and the joy
[1:15:52] is greater than the pain where you won't
[1:15:54] even remember the pain that you went
[1:15:55] through Jesus said observe all things
[1:15:58] whatever I commanded you Lo I'm with you
[1:16:00] always even until the end of the world
[1:16:03] butam said see tonight in our midst
[1:16:05] Jesus Christ God's son he's living with
[1:16:08] us here omniscient omnipresent
[1:16:11] omnipotent he's infinite he's Immortal
[1:16:13] he's God and he's living with us now
[1:16:15] he's not just a god of the past but he's
[1:16:17] a god of the present friends you ain't
[1:16:19] got to travel around the globe to see
[1:16:21] God you don't have to visit a tomb or a
[1:16:23] sanctuary or a c synagogue or a mosque
[1:16:26] or a cathedral but brother mam said
[1:16:28] there ain't but one place to meet God
[1:16:30] and that's in Christ Jesus you say
[1:16:32] brother Matt I want to see God let me
[1:16:34] give you the answer then get into Christ
[1:16:37] I want to see the supernatural then get
[1:16:39] into Christ I want to see Miracles then
[1:16:41] get into Christ I want to see healing
[1:16:43] then get into Christ I want to see
[1:16:45] Revival then get into Christ I want to
[1:16:47] see my prayers answer then get into
[1:16:50] Christ there ain't but one place to meet
[1:16:52] God there's people joins all kinds of
[1:16:54] things all sorts of religions all sorts
[1:16:56] of cult churches that people join around
[1:16:59] this world today religious cults all
[1:17:01] these things but you realize but here's
[1:17:03] the question brother man would make this
[1:17:04] very plain he said are you in a
[1:17:06] denomination seeking after Christ listen
[1:17:08] he's saying the only place to meet God
[1:17:10] is in Christ it ain't in a church it
[1:17:11] ain't in a denomination it ain't in
[1:17:13] somebody's religion or something that a
[1:17:15] man made it's only in Christ Jesus
[1:17:17] somebody say Christ Jesus somebody say
[1:17:19] only it's only in Christ Jesus he said
[1:17:22] see so if you're in a denomination I
[1:17:25] will strictly tell you you are in
[1:17:28] Leia but if you're in Christ then you're
[1:17:31] a new creature Hallelujah and you're in
[1:17:33] the Church of the Living God with the
[1:17:36] manifestation of the very same things
[1:17:38] that he did in his day will be coming
[1:17:40] back here in this day doing the same
[1:17:41] thing he said he would do then that's
[1:17:43] the real church and you get into it by
[1:17:45] spiritual baptism not by joining but by
[1:17:48] being baptized by the Holy Ghost into
[1:17:50] his body it's God's only provided way
[1:17:53] that he has left for us to to do is to
[1:17:55] be baptized into his body or his Spirit
[1:17:58] how many say Amen see if you're in
[1:18:01] Christ you're a new creature and you're
[1:18:04] in the Church of the Living God I don't
[1:18:06] know about y'all that makes me want to
[1:18:08] shout you know what that tells me your
[1:18:11] Dwelling Place determines the atmosphere
[1:18:12] that you live in if you're in Christ
[1:18:15] you're in the Church of the Living God
[1:18:18] outside of that well you're in leosia
[1:18:21] you're either in Christ or you're in Le
[1:18:22] oosa said but your dwelling place that
[1:18:24] terms that listen that's why David would
[1:18:26] say surely goodness and mercy shall
[1:18:28] follow me all the days of my life and I
[1:18:31] will dwell in the house of the Lord
[1:18:33] forever you think about it what does it
[1:18:35] mean to dwell in the Lord's House he
[1:18:37] said I will dwell there forever in other
[1:18:39] words and I'll dwell within the word of
[1:18:42] God I'll dwell in this in this place of
[1:18:44] Refuge this is my dwelling place here
[1:18:46] that God has given us this house of the
[1:18:48] Lord I wonder how many can make that
[1:18:50] statement today I will dwell in the
[1:18:51] house of the Lord forever you know why
[1:18:53] David said that because he was going
[1:18:55] through great trial he was a man that
[1:18:56] had been through tribulations he he he
[1:18:58] was a man that that Satan had tried to
[1:19:00] destroy his life but something in him
[1:19:02] overcame the very thing that Satan would
[1:19:04] try to do and he would say but I will
[1:19:06] dwell in the house of the Lord forever
[1:19:08] you can pull at me but I'm going to find
[1:19:10] myself in the house of the Lord you can
[1:19:12] drag me down but I'll find myself in the
[1:19:14] house of the Lord you can bury me but
[1:19:16] I'm going to find myself in the house of
[1:19:18] the Lord why because it's my dwelling
[1:19:20] place it's my refuge let me tell you
[1:19:22] that's what Satan's trying to do today
[1:19:23] he's trying to take people out of the
[1:19:25] atmosphere of God and away from the
[1:19:27] Church of the Living God and bring a
[1:19:29] formalism upon God's church but let me
[1:19:31] tell you I say to the devil I rebuke you
[1:19:33] in the name of Jesus Christ and I will
[1:19:36] dwell in the house of the Lord forever
[1:19:39] no wonder David begin to speak these
[1:19:40] words he said for the Lord is my
[1:19:43] shepherd and I shall not want oh don't
[1:19:45] you realize what he's saying David was a
[1:19:47] man that knew what a Shepherd was he was
[1:19:48] a man that was raised as a Shepherd but
[1:19:50] let me tell you what it means when David
[1:19:52] said the Lord is my shepherd not only
[1:19:54] was he saying that he had a great
[1:19:56] Shepherd but he said he was my shepherd
[1:19:59] in other words he called the Lord a
[1:20:00] shepherd and he called himself a sheep
[1:20:03] he said the Lord is my shepherd in other
[1:20:05] words not just I'm saying we have a
[1:20:07] Shepherd but I'm saying I'm a sheep in
[1:20:09] God's pasture see it's one thing to
[1:20:11] recognize him as a Shepherd it's another
[1:20:13] thing to recognize yourself as a sheep
[1:20:15] cuz David said because the Lord is my
[1:20:17] shepherd I shall not want and he maketh
[1:20:19] me to lie down in Green Pastures he
[1:20:21] leadth me beside Still Waters they begin
[1:20:23] to talk about the things that the Lord
[1:20:25] was going to do to him because he had a
[1:20:27] great Shepherd think about here here
[1:20:29] this Lord was he said surely goodness
[1:20:31] and mercy would follow me he said here
[1:20:33] here this great Shepherd as he would
[1:20:35] come he would restore my soul and he
[1:20:37] lead me upon the paths of righteousness
[1:20:39] for his name's sake don't you realize
[1:20:41] what David was saying I go down a lot of
[1:20:43] paths in my life I make a lot of turns
[1:20:46] sometimes I find bad places sometimes I
[1:20:48] wind up in bad situations sometimes
[1:20:51] there's trouble in the home sometimes
[1:20:52] there's trouble on the job but listen
[1:20:54] what David saying he said but the Lord
[1:20:56] is leading me down the paths of
[1:20:58] righteousness for his name's sake so let
[1:21:00] me tell you what he's telling you that
[1:21:02] on that path of righteousness sometimes
[1:21:04] there's dark days and sometimes there's
[1:21:06] light days on the path of righteousness
[1:21:09] sometimes you're on a mountain and
[1:21:10] sometimes you're in a valley on the path
[1:21:12] of righteousness sometimes everything's
[1:21:14] good and sometime everything's bad David
[1:21:17] said but though I walk through the
[1:21:18] valley of the shadow of death I'll fear
[1:21:20] no evil for thou art with me and thy rod
[1:21:23] and thy staff they comfort
[1:21:25] me on the path of righteousness that's
[1:21:27] what David had caught a revelation of is
[1:21:29] as I walk through this life I'm on the
[1:21:31] path of righteousness I'm being led by
[1:21:33] God that means when I come into a trial
[1:21:35] that trial was something that God put
[1:21:37] there why because I'm walking on the
[1:21:39] paths of righteousness so when I come in
[1:21:41] the face of death I can say but the rod
[1:21:43] of the Lord is with me the rod and thy
[1:21:46] staff is with me what was it it was a
[1:21:48] top of the word of God David said I have
[1:21:50] a refuge I have a Dwelling Place a place
[1:21:52] I can turn to in the time of trouble in
[1:21:55] the valley of death in the middle of the
[1:21:57] Shadows I have a place that I can turn
[1:21:59] to because my God will deliver me that's
[1:22:01] what we need this morning we need the
[1:22:03] rod of the word of God through every
[1:22:05] trial every place that we walk through
[1:22:07] every lonely and dark day what we need
[1:22:09] is the rod of the word of God to comfort
[1:22:11] us that when we come in the presence of
[1:22:13] our I I love what David said I may as
[1:22:15] well preach it I'm here I love what he
[1:22:16] said he said because in the presence of
[1:22:18] my enemies he said God Made A Feast for
[1:22:21] me right in the presence of my enemies
[1:22:23] when I ought to be scared and said he
[1:22:25] spread a table before me and he spread
[1:22:27] out a feast and said Feast on it today I
[1:22:30] thank God this morning that we still
[1:22:31] have a God that feeds Heavenly Mana in
[1:22:34] the time of trouble you can come to a
[1:22:36] place where the table is spread that you
[1:22:38] could feed on it where the rod of the
[1:22:39] word of the Lord can beat away every
[1:22:41] Spirit every unclean thing every demon
[1:22:44] out of your life that you can set and
[1:22:45] eat in
[1:22:47] peace David said I find peace knowing I
[1:22:50] have a great Shepherd peace knowing that
[1:22:53] I can sit down and in the middle of my
[1:22:55] great trial in the middle of a battle
[1:22:57] but I can spread a table my the world
[1:23:00] come around you don't you realize all
[1:23:01] the there's so much trouble in the land
[1:23:03] don't you realize there's all this
[1:23:04] problem realize the world may in there's
[1:23:06] a war there a there's a nuclear war
[1:23:08] about to happen don't you y'all need to
[1:23:09] wake up y'all need to get scared but in
[1:23:11] the middle of all of this he said
[1:23:13] there's a table spread before me is't
[1:23:16] that good and all of this there's a
[1:23:18] feast said what are you doing then I'm
[1:23:21] going to sit down at the table and feast
[1:23:22] upon the word of God you know because
[1:23:24] it's our dwelling place it's our refuge
[1:23:27] in a time of a storm and the more you
[1:23:28] Feast on it the stronger you get in the
[1:23:30] middle of all that all of a sudden all
[1:23:31] them feedings begin to go away because
[1:23:33] you're feasting upon the word or the
[1:23:35] table that God said friends that's what
[1:23:37] we need this morning we need the rod of
[1:23:39] the word of God turn loose on the devil
[1:23:41] ain't that right lilam we need the rod
[1:23:43] of the word turn loose on the devil that
[1:23:45] he could bring it in that's what the
[1:23:46] shepherd's Rod was for it wasn't to beat
[1:23:48] sheep with it was a beat off wolves and
[1:23:50] that's what it's for is to come in this
[1:23:51] morning and to drive every wolf out of
[1:23:53] the building to dve Drive every wolf out
[1:23:55] of your home don't you realize there's
[1:23:56] wolves that Circle Our Lives there's
[1:23:58] wolves that circles a herd let me tell
[1:24:00] you every time there's a herd of sheep
[1:24:02] there's a wolf somewhere off in the
[1:24:03] distance just looking for a way in but
[1:24:05] that's what David said he said but I
[1:24:07] have a great Shepherd I can lay my head
[1:24:09] down in high in the middle of Green
[1:24:11] Pastures knowing that I'm in a refuge
[1:24:13] there's a rock wall that's built around
[1:24:14] me and at the doorway my shepherd lays a
[1:24:17] resting that when a wolf would come he'd
[1:24:19] have to go through him before he could
[1:24:21] ever get to me the Lord is my shepherd I
[1:24:24] shall not want that's what we need this
[1:24:27] morning it's the rod of the word turned
[1:24:30] loose that would release the power of
[1:24:32] God in your life how many say Amen to
[1:24:34] that let it be turned loose this morning
[1:24:36] you know I think about about this word
[1:24:39] first second Timothy three listen what
[1:24:41] the Bible says can I talk about this can
[1:24:42] I talk about the rod of the word a
[1:24:44] minute I got a minute B the Bible says
[1:24:46] all scriptures given by inspiration of
[1:24:48] God it's profitable for Doctrine for
[1:24:50] Repro and for correction and instruction
[1:24:53] in righteousness all somebody say all
[1:24:55] scripture all scripture it's given my
[1:24:57] inspiration of God profitable for
[1:24:59] Doctrine correction instruction and
[1:25:01] righteousness that the man of God may be
[1:25:03] perfect and thoroughly furnished unto
[1:25:05] all good works in other words he gave us
[1:25:08] all scriptures that we would be equipped
[1:25:10] to overcome the world that we would be
[1:25:12] equipped to succeed in our walk with God
[1:25:14] we'd be equipped to fulfill our purpose
[1:25:16] we would be equipped brother Joe to meet
[1:25:18] our or to reach our destination he would
[1:25:20] he would thoroughly furnish us with the
[1:25:23] word of God now watch this the Bible
[1:25:26] says Jesus said Matthew 24 Heaven and
[1:25:28] Earth shall pass away but my word shall
[1:25:30] not pass away so here we have a word
[1:25:33] that will thoroughly equip us and
[1:25:35] brother Tom and then here Jesus said it
[1:25:37] will not pass away see what that shows
[1:25:39] us is it wasn't just for disciples for
[1:25:41] 2,000 years ago but it was for today
[1:25:43] because it'll never pass away that means
[1:25:45] whatever day you're born in can I just
[1:25:46] make oh man it just feel it just feels
[1:25:48] good to me it don't matter what year
[1:25:49] you're born my word will never pass away
[1:25:52] I was born in the middle of a hurricane
[1:25:53] but my word will never never pass away I
[1:25:55] was born in a tornado but my word will
[1:25:56] never pass away I was born in a blizzard
[1:25:58] but my word will never it do matter when
[1:26:00] or where what the conditions were that
[1:26:02] you had your birthday and my word will
[1:26:03] never pass away say See it'll it'll
[1:26:06] never pass away so you notice that what
[1:26:09] that tells us is that if if Paul said it
[1:26:12] was inspired by God Jesus said it'll
[1:26:14] never pass away then that means what was
[1:26:17] inspired by God 2,000 years ago is still
[1:26:20] inspired by God today somebody say Amen
[1:26:23] if it was inspired or following with me
[1:26:25] I'm I'm I'm building to something you
[1:26:26] see that's what we need today in the
[1:26:28] church that's why we need the word of
[1:26:30] God because it's an inspired word of God
[1:26:32] last week I was speaking on the the word
[1:26:33] being an anointed word and here that
[1:26:35] anointed word that is inspired by God
[1:26:37] but notice it has to be inspired in the
[1:26:39] right at the right season the right time
[1:26:41] for the right purpose that's what we
[1:26:43] need we come to church to hear what we
[1:26:45] come to hear an inspired word we come to
[1:26:47] hear an Inspire an inspired thing you
[1:26:49] know you know what it means to be
[1:26:50] inspired brother Wesley it means to give
[1:26:53] rise to so in other words if something
[1:26:55] inspires you then it's lifting you it
[1:26:58] gives rise to you it causes you to want
[1:26:59] to move it causes you to want to walk it
[1:27:01] caus you to want to say Amen it caused
[1:27:03] you to want to clap your hands it caused
[1:27:05] you to want to shout because inspiration
[1:27:07] means to give rise to so here he said we
[1:27:10] have an inspired word and all scriptures
[1:27:12] are inspired and so we come we come to
[1:27:15] the church this morning to to find an
[1:27:17] inspired word we want a word that will
[1:27:18] cause us to rise we need a word that
[1:27:20] will cause us to move we need a word
[1:27:22] that'll cause us to act this is the very
[1:27:24] thing that tells you why many people go
[1:27:26] to churches today and there's no that
[1:27:28] there ain't nobody moving there ain't no
[1:27:30] action there there ain't nobody there
[1:27:31] ain't nobody having any Revival there
[1:27:33] ain't nobody free everything's formal
[1:27:35] and dead and cold because that they're
[1:27:36] not bringing an inspired word they may
[1:27:39] read out of the same Bible you say man
[1:27:41] what a paradox this is think about it an
[1:27:43] inspired word it causes you to say Amen
[1:27:45] an inspired word it causes you to want
[1:27:47] more an Inspire word it causes you to
[1:27:49] preach it causes you to want to sing it
[1:27:51] moves you it causes you want to do
[1:27:52] something for the Lord let me tell you
[1:27:54] that's what we need today we need
[1:27:55] inspired singers we need inspired
[1:27:58] worshippers we need inspired preachers
[1:28:00] that are inspired by God let me tell you
[1:28:02] if you have no inspiration you ain't got
[1:28:04] no business in God's pull pit if you got
[1:28:06] no inspiration you ain't got no business
[1:28:08] singing any songs because what we need
[1:28:10] today is an inspired word of God a man
[1:28:14] without inspiration causes more harm
[1:28:16] than he'll ever cause good it's not you
[1:28:18] think about why because it's not by an
[1:28:20] inspired word if if you take a non-
[1:28:22] inspired word it'll leave people down a
[1:28:24] path of spiritual death and people you
[1:28:27] know what the mental oh I'm going to get
[1:28:28] myself in trouble I I'll just preach
[1:28:30] what the Lord tells me to to preach but
[1:28:31] you know what happens when a man that is
[1:28:33] uninspired he'll come back and say but I
[1:28:35] read a true scripture and I spoke true
[1:28:38] things so it must have been inspired but
[1:28:40] you realize it was still uninspired
[1:28:42] because the direction was not God's
[1:28:44] Direction now here lays a paradox in the
[1:28:45] Bible I'm teaching you something now
[1:28:47] here lays a paradox how can you read an
[1:28:50] inspired word and it be
[1:28:52] uninspired think about it how can you
[1:28:54] read an inspired word and it not Inspire
[1:28:56] anybody how can it be uninspired let me
[1:28:59] tell you how prophet of God said he said
[1:29:01] that every word in the Bible is God's
[1:29:03] thoughts laying in seed form and if it's
[1:29:06] received into a human being very common
[1:29:07] quote and spoke by the same thought that
[1:29:10] materialize the Bible then it'll bring
[1:29:12] it to pass see what I mean how powerful
[1:29:15] the church could be let this mind be in
[1:29:17] you that was in Christ Jesus so in other
[1:29:19] words if a word is spoken with the same
[1:29:22] thought in the same direction that it
[1:29:24] was written in then it will have effect
[1:29:26] but that same word that inspired word
[1:29:29] can be spoken with a different direction
[1:29:31] or a different thought that's why you
[1:29:32] don't want men without inspiration
[1:29:34] taking a hold of the word of God and
[1:29:36] bringing it before the people because
[1:29:37] they can take the same word uninspired
[1:29:39] and cause cause harm or lead people
[1:29:42] astray well I I quoted a scripture I
[1:29:44] read a good scripture I said a bunch of
[1:29:46] things I hollered like all the other
[1:29:47] preachers don't that make me inspired no
[1:29:49] it don't make you inspired let me give
[1:29:51] you a little lesson on the Bible
[1:29:52] whenever Jesus went to be temped Ed by
[1:29:54] the devil Satan quoted him scriptures he
[1:29:57] took the Bible and he quoted him
[1:29:58] scriptures and they were inspired
[1:30:00] scriptures but his Direction was wrong
[1:30:03] because it wasn't the thought that God
[1:30:04] had intended it for and because his
[1:30:06] Direction was to stop the Son of God
[1:30:08] from fulfilling his purpose it would
[1:30:10] have destroyed you and I then Jesus
[1:30:12] could stand up there say yeah it's an
[1:30:14] inspired word but you ain't using it the
[1:30:16] right
[1:30:17] way he made it uninspired because he was
[1:30:20] used it in a different direction that's
[1:30:22] why as a pastor I'm obligated to protect
[1:30:24] this pull pit you can well that that he
[1:30:27] he only reads true things he only says
[1:30:28] true things but I'm o obligated to make
[1:30:31] sure that the inspired word of God is
[1:30:33] what's preached out of this pull pit and
[1:30:34] then the man that's standing behind this
[1:30:36] desk is going the same direction that
[1:30:38] we're going as a body you won't come
[1:30:39] behind this desk and take this church in
[1:30:41] another direction or take it down some
[1:30:43] different avenue or drag it down some
[1:30:45] pit or some other dead church somewhere
[1:30:47] this church is moving on with God it's
[1:30:49] an inspired Church an inspired people
[1:30:51] inspired by the message of the hour and
[1:30:53] there ain't nothing else is welcome in
[1:30:55] this place take it somewhere else
[1:30:57] they'll open a door for you to take it
[1:30:59] but it ain't no longer welcome here I
[1:31:00] want an inspired preacher I want
[1:31:02] inspired men of God I want inspired
[1:31:04] people of God that can take the word of
[1:31:06] God and make it effective no longer is
[1:31:09] it a place of non-affected that's what
[1:31:11] we ought to stand up and tell the devil
[1:31:13] I ain't a place of nonaffected but let
[1:31:15] the word of God become inspired in my
[1:31:18] heart that I might be a real believer
[1:31:19] and let me manifest the truth of God's
[1:31:22] word if it ain't changing in your life
[1:31:24] then there's something wrong with you
[1:31:26] leave the pull pit alone leave it to the
[1:31:29] leave it to those that are inspired by
[1:31:30] God and led by God to be there to lead
[1:31:32] God's children don't bring me No Junk
[1:31:35] it's an inspired word of God don't ask
[1:31:38] me to come up here and preach it's an
[1:31:40] inspired word of God I'm looking for
[1:31:43] inspiration of the word of God why
[1:31:45] because I want the direction that God
[1:31:47] wants to lead to in you say how can that
[1:31:50] be do you realize in the days of Moses
[1:31:52] this same thing you realize what
[1:31:54] happened remember when daythan and cor
[1:31:56] came up and they said well we're just as
[1:31:58] holy as Moses is what makes him the
[1:31:59] leader we'll just make our own we y'all
[1:32:03] come and worship with us well what was
[1:32:04] they trying to do they was trying to
[1:32:05] take the church in a different direction
[1:32:07] you know why they sit around a bunch of
[1:32:08] men that had sorry ideas and said that
[1:32:11] Moses wasn't the only one that could
[1:32:12] lead the church and they came into the
[1:32:14] Church of the Living God and they tried
[1:32:15] to bring the same thing in there and say
[1:32:17] well we can just go this direction
[1:32:19] because after all these are good men
[1:32:22] too and Moses said but God God told me
[1:32:24] to lead
[1:32:25] it and you're inspired but it ain't by
[1:32:27] it ain't by God and the Lord came to him
[1:32:30] you know what Moses did he didn't go and
[1:32:32] try to punish them the Bible says he
[1:32:33] fell down on his face and he was praying
[1:32:35] for them asking God for their mercy and
[1:32:38] you know what God told him because they
[1:32:40] had rebuked God in such a way it
[1:32:41] offended God so badly it offended God so
[1:32:44] badly he said Moses you get up you tell
[1:32:47] them to come and make a l a sacrifice
[1:32:50] unto me you tell them to come and burn
[1:32:52] incense before the temple he he said and
[1:32:54] then you get you and all your people
[1:32:55] away from Kora and all of his family
[1:32:57] because I'm going to destroy them so you
[1:32:59] know what Moses did he took a step back
[1:33:01] here he wanted to help them here he
[1:33:03] wanted to be a deliverer here he wanted
[1:33:04] to be their savior but God said you get
[1:33:06] away and take your hands on it off of it
[1:33:08] because it's an unclean thing that's why
[1:33:10] a man that's inspired by God don't go
[1:33:12] back and touch something that's unclean
[1:33:13] because God said stay away from it so he
[1:33:16] stepped back he said if I am telling you
[1:33:19] the word of the Lord he said then this
[1:33:20] day it won't be no light thing you won't
[1:33:22] go by the way of the
[1:33:24] his prophecies wasn't like these these
[1:33:26] false prophets make today but his
[1:33:28] prophecy was true he said if I speak
[1:33:30] through a prophecy it ain't going to be
[1:33:31] something you think that could have
[1:33:32] happened another way they ain't going to
[1:33:34] die of old age they ain't going to die
[1:33:36] of a sickness they're not going to get
[1:33:37] an ailment but I say unto you this day
[1:33:39] that the Earth will open up and it will
[1:33:41] swallow them in it and all that belongs
[1:33:43] to them and the Bible said when he got
[1:33:44] done speaking that the Earth opened up
[1:33:46] and here Kora and day and all their
[1:33:48] families or all all all that that was
[1:33:50] following after them that would fell
[1:33:52] down in the Earth and the Earth closed
[1:33:53] up over
[1:33:54] them and all of those that burn incense
[1:33:57] that was followers of them you know I
[1:33:59] they they went into the temple and the
[1:34:00] Bible says the the fire of God fell upon
[1:34:02] it and it burned all those men God
[1:34:04] didn't consume the incense he consumed
[1:34:06] the men why because they were
[1:34:08] uninspired here they were following this
[1:34:10] is what brother B call he actually calls
[1:34:12] Kora he said it's always the leaders in
[1:34:15] the church that gets people out of the
[1:34:16] will of God he said Kora was an
[1:34:18] uninspired leader he said Moses thinks
[1:34:21] he's the only holy man he said but we
[1:34:23] got as much holy men and here as he does
[1:34:25] he said see but God told Moses you
[1:34:26] separate from him I'll sink him in that
[1:34:29] whole group Moses was God's leader he
[1:34:31] was Vindicated by God to be a leader and
[1:34:33] all that didn't listen to him perish he
[1:34:35] said and we have a leader today he's
[1:34:37] called the Holy Ghost and those that
[1:34:39] don't obey the Holy Ghost the the one
[1:34:41] that wrote the Bible they are going to
[1:34:43] perish you know I could have Grace for
[1:34:46] Dayan but Cora how could you have Grace
[1:34:48] for cor you know why cuz cor had a
[1:34:50] position in the house of God but he
[1:34:52] wasn't satisfied with his position
[1:34:54] Kora he was the one that went in and he
[1:34:55] made preparation see dayam was of the
[1:34:57] tribe of Reuben but Kora was of the
[1:34:59] tribe of Levi so here a levite that was
[1:35:02] born in the house of Levi that came in
[1:35:04] the temple of God that had a place that
[1:35:06] had a place in the temple that God could
[1:35:07] use him but he wasn't satisfied with his
[1:35:09] place in the temple and he wanted more
[1:35:11] that's what Moses told him he said you
[1:35:13] can't do that and you want to be a
[1:35:14] priest also here God's gave you a way to
[1:35:17] serve him that you want to be a priest
[1:35:19] also but he was
[1:35:21] uninspired and God swallowed them up
[1:35:25] said see we have to follow our leader
[1:35:28] that's the Holy Ghost if they don't obey
[1:35:30] the Holy Ghost then they're going to
[1:35:32] perish you know what step back from them
[1:35:35] step back from them stay away from them
[1:35:37] don't entertain them step back from them
[1:35:40] see it must be inspired by the Holy
[1:35:42] Ghost you say brother Matt I want to see
[1:35:44] a Revival well then what you need is a
[1:35:46] man that's inspired by God and a people
[1:35:49] that can be inspired that's what'll
[1:35:51] bring a Revival in your heart it's a a
[1:35:53] word that inspires them something that
[1:35:55] moves that brings inspiration that that
[1:35:57] we can be like David and say I will
[1:35:59] dwell in the house of the Lord forever
[1:36:01] we need Aspire an inspired word that
[1:36:03] will cause us to dwell in the in the
[1:36:04] will of God how many can say that this
[1:36:06] morning I'll dwell in the inspired word
[1:36:08] of God y'all don't quit on me y let let
[1:36:10] me preach he said I want to I want to
[1:36:13] dwell in the inspired word of God you
[1:36:14] say how how can I be sure to be able to
[1:36:17] dwell in this place how can I live there
[1:36:18] forever give me a few minutes how how
[1:36:20] can I live there I've been preaching 40
[1:36:22] minutes how can I live there forever he
[1:36:24] said I I want to find a place an
[1:36:26] inspired word of God that I can be sure
[1:36:28] that I can make it you say oh friends
[1:36:30] let me tell you you can't help but make
[1:36:32] it you can't help but make it you can
[1:36:34] you say how can I dwell in the house of
[1:36:35] the Lord forever in all these trials how
[1:36:37] can I dwell here in all these
[1:36:39] tribulations how can I stay in the word
[1:36:41] of God and all these failures how can I
[1:36:43] how can I keep my spirit how can I dwell
[1:36:45] in the house of the Lord let me tell you
[1:36:47] just as David was brother Morgan you
[1:36:48] can't help but dwell here you can't help
[1:36:50] but make it you know why cuz I can take
[1:36:52] these scriptures that are under
[1:36:54] inspiration and when you take a
[1:36:55] scripture under inspiration then the
[1:36:57] very power that they were written under
[1:36:59] it comes alive so when you take a a
[1:37:01] Bible that a verse that is inspired by
[1:37:04] God and you preach it under inspiration
[1:37:06] then the power that it was written under
[1:37:08] it becomes alive in the Assembly of God
[1:37:10] and it causes a Revival in Heart It
[1:37:12] causes you to be able to live another
[1:37:13] day it it's a refreshing it brings joy
[1:37:16] and sorrow it brings peace in a time of
[1:37:18] trouble because it's an inspired
[1:37:20] word listen to an inspired word of God
[1:37:23] how how can I make it how am I sure that
[1:37:25] I'll be able to make it how am I sure
[1:37:26] I'll be able to survive you know who I'm
[1:37:28] talking to how I'll dwell in the house
[1:37:29] of the Lord forever there ain't no
[1:37:31] telling how many people in this building
[1:37:32] are watching this server that Satan
[1:37:34] ain't came by and said that you you're
[1:37:36] just not going to be able to make it any
[1:37:37] longer you ain't going to be able to
[1:37:38] serve God any longer this was a
[1:37:40] temporary dwelling for you but you know
[1:37:42] what you don't even belong in the house
[1:37:43] of God but you belong in the world I've
[1:37:45] got something greater for you but David
[1:37:47] said but in the face of all that I'll
[1:37:48] dwell in the house of the Lord
[1:37:51] forever how can I be sure brother that
[1:37:53] I'll be able to dwell there can I just
[1:37:55] give you an inspired
[1:37:56] scripture I said can I give you an
[1:37:58] inspired scripture the Bible said Joshua
[1:38:01] in the book of Joshua every word that
[1:38:03] God spoke to Israel failed not somebody
[1:38:05] say Amen every word that God spoke it
[1:38:08] failed not a that something God's word
[1:38:10] don't fail in the Book of Luke whenever
[1:38:12] Mary begin to doubt the angel of the
[1:38:14] Lord listen what the angel said he said
[1:38:16] for with God nothing shall be impossible
[1:38:19] she said how can this thing be he said
[1:38:20] with God nothing shall be impossible let
[1:38:22] me tell you a testimony somebody else
[1:38:24] there's another cousin of yours her
[1:38:25] name's Elizabeth 6 months she's been
[1:38:27] with child and she was also buried just
[1:38:29] like you see with God nothing shall be
[1:38:32] impossible and that word in the
[1:38:34] Amplified Bible it means no word from
[1:38:36] God shall be without power or be
[1:38:38] impossible to fulfill so means if God
[1:38:41] says it it has to happen God's word
[1:38:44] Can't Fail somebody say that with me
[1:38:46] God's word Can't Fail somebody say it
[1:38:47] out loud God's word can't fail so you
[1:38:50] think about this when you look at these
[1:38:51] scriptures inspired used in the right
[1:38:53] context it will Express the mind of God
[1:38:56] see so in inspired scripture you take it
[1:38:58] the right way and the Bible says first
[1:39:00] off his word Can't Fail now watch the
[1:39:02] next scripture Galatians 3 an inspired
[1:39:05] word used in the direction God had
[1:39:07] intended it for listen what Paul said he
[1:39:09] said you are the children of God by
[1:39:11] faith in Christ Jesus look what you do
[1:39:13] whenever you can be inspired by the word
[1:39:15] of God you can take scripture here here
[1:39:17] here and they all come together to show
[1:39:19] you the mind of God or or to express the
[1:39:21] very thoughts of God for this for the
[1:39:23] day that we're living even every every
[1:39:25] day is something relevant that God will
[1:39:27] take all these scriptures and bring them
[1:39:29] together to show you his mind this is
[1:39:31] what God's trying that's why we come to
[1:39:32] an assembly and hear the preaching of
[1:39:34] the word that's why that's why we have
[1:39:36] real life preachers that's why we have
[1:39:37] men that are anointed of God because we
[1:39:39] want God to use gifts that he's placed
[1:39:41] in the body to bring the word of God and
[1:39:43] to bring something out of the mind of
[1:39:45] God and present it to the people how
[1:39:47] many wants to hear the mind of God so
[1:39:49] Paul said for you are children of God by
[1:39:51] faith in Christ Jesus but said see so if
[1:39:54] you're a children of God in other words
[1:39:56] you're the sons or Daughters of God then
[1:39:58] that makes you a part of God how many
[1:40:00] believe that see my son's a part of me
[1:40:02] because he he he was from me so he's a
[1:40:04] part of me so if you're a Son of God or
[1:40:06] a child of God then you are a part of
[1:40:08] God so if you're a part of God and God
[1:40:11] is what what the Bible say God was his
[1:40:13] word so if you're a part of God then
[1:40:15] you're a part of the word of God you see
[1:40:18] these inspired scriptures coming
[1:40:20] together and that means if God's word
[1:40:22] can't fail and and you're a part of
[1:40:24] God's word then what's that mean about
[1:40:26] you that means that you can't fail it
[1:40:28] don't matter what the devil brings on
[1:40:30] your life you can't fail he can't take
[1:40:32] you out of the Church of the Living God
[1:40:34] he can't drag your soul into hell he
[1:40:37] can't turn you away from God because
[1:40:38] you're a part of God and God's word
[1:40:40] don't fail and you're part of God's word
[1:40:43] and you can't fail either that means you
[1:40:45] can never fail because you're in Christ
[1:40:47] Jesus brother Carter you you can receive
[1:40:50] salvation because you're in Christ Jesus
[1:40:52] you have power to over come because
[1:40:54] you're in Christ Jesus you can defeat
[1:40:56] every every enemy because you're in
[1:40:57] Christ Jesus every tormented spirit
[1:40:59] because you're in Christ Jesus you can
[1:41:01] stand the test of time because you're in
[1:41:03] Christ Jesus Oh friends if you go by the
[1:41:05] way of the Grave don't you worry you've
[1:41:07] already been buried in Christ and you
[1:41:09] were raised with him and one day you'll
[1:41:11] meet with him in the air that's old robe
[1:41:13] of Flesh don't let it bother you don't
[1:41:15] let it trouble you but my Bible said it
[1:41:17] was already paid for it calvary your
[1:41:19] salvation it don't matter what this
[1:41:21] robee's put on one day you'll put it off
[1:41:23] you'll put on another robe called
[1:41:25] immortality and you'll dwell with him in
[1:41:27] the air don't worry about it for the
[1:41:29] Bible said you can no more die then God
[1:41:32] can die what is it it's an inspired word
[1:41:34] for those of us that are looking at the
[1:41:36] face of death to know that I can't even
[1:41:38] die why it's inspired for our
[1:41:41] situation in the time of death in the
[1:41:44] time of sorrow in the Valley of the
[1:41:46] shadow of death you can look in the word
[1:41:48] of God and say what what did my shepherd
[1:41:50] say about it oh there it is he said you
[1:41:52] can no more die then God could die cuz
[1:41:55] you've already died and been buried with
[1:41:57] him and resurrected before there could
[1:42:00] be a judgment think about it those that
[1:42:02] are alive and remain will be called to
[1:42:04] meet him in the air don't worry about

[1:42:18] something David said A thousand shall
[1:42:21] fall at my side 10,000 at my right hand
[1:42:23] but it'll not come nigh thee because
[1:42:26] listen why he said all this may fall
[1:42:28] around me but it won't come nigh my
[1:42:30] house why he said he said because I have
[1:42:33] made the Lord my
[1:42:35] habitation why will trouble not come

[1:42:40] see he said the the you you you will sit
[1:42:43] and because you made the Lord your
[1:42:44] habitation you will watch The Wicked
[1:42:47] receive their reward but it won't come
[1:42:48] nigh thee you'll watch them receive
[1:42:50] their judgment but it won't come nigh
[1:42:52] thee won't come your house he said there
[1:42:54] shall no evil befall thee can I read
[1:42:56] this Inspire word there shall no evil
[1:42:58] Beall thee how many does that inspire
[1:43:00] you and say brother Mt that's for me I
[1:43:01] know it was it inspired my heart when
[1:43:03] you read it there shall no evil befall
[1:43:05] thee neither shall any plague Come N thy
[1:43:08] dwelling why because you're dwelling in
[1:43:10] the house of the Lord you're in Christ
[1:43:12] Jesus he gave us a place to meet him he
[1:43:15] gave us a place to worship him let me
[1:43:17] tell you friends if you want to truly
[1:43:18] worship God you have to come to the
[1:43:20] right place listen what the Bible said
[1:43:22] here here the the the the Shepherds they
[1:43:25] said one to another let us go even unto
[1:43:28] Bethlehem and see this thing which has
[1:43:31] come to pass which the Lord hath made
[1:43:34] known unto us can I close with
[1:43:37] this let us go and see the thing let us
[1:43:40] go to Bethlehem and see this thing which
[1:43:42] the Lord has made known to us that word
[1:43:44] made known it means it was something
[1:43:47] that was revealed to them so here when
[1:43:49] God makes something known to you then
[1:43:51] you then watch first it was made known
[1:43:54] and then they went to Bethlehem see so
[1:43:56] until God makes it known to you then you
[1:43:59] can't even Worship in it but when God
[1:44:00] makes it known to you then you can
[1:44:02] worship in it and you can rejoice in it
[1:44:04] because he has made it known see notice
[1:44:06] what what it was here they were on their
[1:44:08] way to Bethlehem God made known to them
[1:44:10] something was going to take place so
[1:44:11] watch where they went when the
[1:44:12] Revelation was made known then here they
[1:44:14] go off to Bethlehem isn't it something
[1:44:16] that they went to Bethlehem brother
[1:44:17] Jared it was the place remember the
[1:44:19] Angels Came the Bible or or it would
[1:44:21] call it the First Noel the under the is
[1:44:23] born in the city of David Christ the
[1:44:25] lord it was the place that the Angels
[1:44:27] first made their appearance to sing it
[1:44:29] was at it wasn't at Jerusalem or some
[1:44:31] big church it wasn't at gilgal or some
[1:44:33] great place of worship it wasn't in
[1:44:35] shaloh the great place of history of
[1:44:37] historical worship but where it was it
[1:44:39] wasn't these great religious
[1:44:40] denominations in the world but where did
[1:44:42] the Angels make their appearance to sing
[1:44:44] they sung that great Noel they sang it
[1:44:47] in the city of David in the town of
[1:44:49] Bethlehem in this little old
[1:44:50] insignificant place is where the angels
[1:44:53] of the Lord went he said why was it
[1:44:54] there he said it was in Bethlehem where
[1:44:56] the spirit of God has been moving in a
[1:44:59] mysterious way so here something was
[1:45:01] made known to them and they said well
[1:45:03] what's been made known let us go to
[1:45:05] Bethlehem that we can see it with our
[1:45:06] own eyes we it's been made known to me
[1:45:08] it's been revealed to me now may I go to
[1:45:10] Bethlehem and the Bible said and the
[1:45:11] Shepherds went to Bethlehem and when
[1:45:13] they left Bethlehem I makes me want a
[1:45:15] shout when they left Bethlehem they
[1:45:17] returned and they were glorifying and
[1:45:19] praising God for all the things that
[1:45:21] they had heard and seen as it was told
[1:45:23] to them when they left Bethlehem they
[1:45:26] left praising God when they left
[1:45:28] Bethlehem they left glorifying God they
[1:45:30] left worshiping him you see what
[1:45:32] happened something happened to them
[1:45:34] because they went to the right place to
[1:45:35] meet Jesus two years later there was
[1:45:38] wise men that seen a star in the east
[1:45:40] and they said we have seen his star they
[1:45:42] came to herod's place they said we've
[1:45:44] seen his star and we come to worship him
[1:45:46] where did they go they went to the town
[1:45:48] of Bethlehem to find this young man this
[1:45:51] young boy that was sitting there a 2y
[1:45:52] old boy with his mother and they brought
[1:45:54] gifts and the Bible says and they fell
[1:45:56] down and they worshiped at the feet of
[1:45:59] Jesus they fell down they worshiped him
[1:46:02] they gave him gold and frankincense and
[1:46:04] myr why because God had made something
[1:46:06] known to them and they went to the place
[1:46:08] of Bethlehem after it was made known and
[1:46:11] when they left Bethlehem they left
[1:46:13] rejoicing and glorifying and praising
[1:46:15] God because they went to Bethlehem they
[1:46:18] found him there you think about what
[1:46:19] Bethlehem was but said notice he said it
[1:46:22] was the cner the historians would tell
[1:46:23] you it was the great weak country it was
[1:46:25] a place of irrigation they had great
[1:46:27] weak crops but Bethlehem was also the
[1:46:30] place where the best water was so here
[1:46:32] this place of Bethlehem which was the
[1:46:34] house of God's bread it was the place
[1:46:36] where all the wheat was grown in the
[1:46:37] region but it was a place that was well
[1:46:39] known for its great Wells of water and
[1:46:42] great water he said it was the bread
[1:46:44] Center and the Water Center of Palestine
[1:46:47] he said so today it don't matter how
[1:46:49] many organizations we have it don't
[1:46:51] matter how many so-called brethren that
[1:46:53] we have they may be he said but still
[1:46:55] yet Christ is the believer's Bethlehem
[1:46:59] that's what God gave us that's the place
[1:47:02] that God has given us to go for he is
[1:47:04] our place of bread and water oh it's no
[1:47:07] wonder that the shepherd said let us now
[1:47:09] go to Bethlehem for this thing has been
[1:47:11] made known to us let's go to Bethlehem
[1:47:13] that we may rejoice in it let's go to
[1:47:15] Bethlehem that we may have Revival in it
[1:47:18] that we can leave praising and joy and a
[1:47:20] Revival could stack our heart again oh
[1:47:22] my than about it to see the things which
[1:47:24] the Lord has made known to us why do you
[1:47:26] go to Bethlehem because I want to see
[1:47:28] the things that God has made known I
[1:47:30] want to see him declared in my life I
[1:47:32] want to see what God has made known I
[1:47:34] want to see it manifested in my life let
[1:47:36] me tell you friends you me tell you how
[1:47:37] to do it I thank God today that we have
[1:47:40] a place to go brother Wesley the angel
[1:47:42] of the Lord has came today and you know
[1:47:44] what he done he came to make known the
[1:47:46] ways of God he came to make known the
[1:47:48] supernatural he came to make known the
[1:47:50] resurrection of Jesus Christ and now now
[1:47:53] as a body of Believers we take the thing
[1:47:55] that was made known in the and we go to
[1:47:57] the believer's Bethlehem and you know
[1:47:59] what'll happen you'll come away
[1:48:00] rejoicing you know why people can't
[1:48:02] rejoice in this message cuz they take
[1:48:04] the things that was made known and they
[1:48:06] go run it by Shiloh and see if it fits
[1:48:07] in they'll take the message that was
[1:48:09] preached that was made known by the
[1:48:11] angel and they'll go down to gilgal and
[1:48:13] see if they agree with it you know why
[1:48:14] they don't come away rejoicing and why
[1:48:16] they're troubled in their spirit and
[1:48:18] they can't get free and just worship God
[1:48:20] and believe the message of the hour that
[1:48:22] was sent by the angel of the lord it's
[1:48:24] cuz they trying to take it to the wrong
[1:48:26] place people say I'm at the wrong place
[1:48:28] at the wrong time I say we're at the
[1:48:30] wrong place with the wrong Revelation
[1:48:32] but what we need to do is go to the
[1:48:34] right place with the right Revelation
[1:48:36] and take what God has made known and
[1:48:38] when you go to the right place for the
[1:48:39] right Revelation it's a time for
[1:48:42] rejoicing I say it's a time for
[1:48:44] rejoicing this morning Jesus said I give
[1:48:47] you the power to tread on serpents and
[1:48:49] scorpions over the power of the enemy
[1:48:52] and nothing shall hurt you how many
[1:48:53] claim that this morning I give you the
[1:48:55] power how many will accept that I give
[1:48:57] you the power to tread on serpents I
[1:48:59] give you the power to tread on scorpions
[1:49:01] I give you the power to walk on spirits
[1:49:03] that would come and and and and destroy
[1:49:05] your home and destroy your relationship
[1:49:07] with your family I give you the power to
[1:49:09] tread them
[1:49:11] underfoot Jesus said but don't Rejoice
[1:49:14] because you have power over
[1:49:16] Spirits he said be Rejoice rather
[1:49:18] because your names are written in
[1:49:21] heaven h
[1:49:24] think about
[1:49:26] it you know why you can tell people that
[1:49:28] and they don't Rejoice cuz they don't
[1:49:30] know what it
[1:49:31] meant you know why you can quote that
[1:49:33] Rejoice that your name is written in
[1:49:35] heaven why can you say that and inspired
[1:49:37] scripture to somebody and it don't do
[1:49:39] nothing to them because it's not
[1:49:41] inspired to them they don't have a
[1:49:43] revelation see so notice what had to
[1:49:45] take place see before they don't Rejoice
[1:49:48] they don't they don't know what it means
[1:49:50] to have their name written in other
[1:49:51] words it hasn't been made known
[1:49:53] you know that you think about it what it
[1:49:54] meant to have your name written remember
[1:49:57] the Bible said there was a book of life
[1:49:58] our names were written in the book of
[1:49:59] life if you if you were to take one part
[1:50:01] out of the out of the out of the book it
[1:50:03] your name would be taken off the book of
[1:50:04] life it would be blotted out we find
[1:50:06] generations of people in Israel that
[1:50:07] names were taken off that book you
[1:50:08] realize that many would read that and
[1:50:10] say well our name can come off of it our
[1:50:11] name can't come off of it then we read
[1:50:13] in another place that said our name's
[1:50:14] written in the Lamb's Book of Life and
[1:50:15] our name can never be removed because it
[1:50:16] was written there before the foundation
[1:50:18] of the world see it hasn't been made
[1:50:19] known to you but here what God did is he
[1:50:22] sent an angel in this age and the angel
[1:50:24] of the Lord he began to speak in the
[1:50:26] breaking of the seals and whenever the
[1:50:27] angel of the Lord came what was he doing
[1:50:29] he was making known the mystery of God
[1:50:31] and when he made it known he said I want
[1:50:33] you to know about that book of life he
[1:50:34] said it's actually he said there's one
[1:50:36] great book it's the book of life he said
[1:50:38] but in it is another book it's called
[1:50:39] the Lamb's Book of Life That's why many
[1:50:41] people miss it he said it's just like
[1:50:42] looking at a wheat plant outside you say
[1:50:44] well there is wheat but really it's not
[1:50:46] wheat that one part of it's a stock part
[1:50:48] of it's a leaf part of it's a shook part
[1:50:50] of it's a a root but none of it only one
[1:50:52] little part of it is actually wheat but
[1:50:54] we call it all wheat he said so when God
[1:50:56] talks about the book of life he calls it
[1:50:58] all the same thing he said but whenever
[1:51:00] he's talking about the the one that
[1:51:02] Christ took the seal off of he said it
[1:51:04] was the Lamb's Book of Life it was the
[1:51:06] title de the book of redemption he said
[1:51:08] and when your name is written down in
[1:51:09] there there ain't nothing can take it
[1:51:11] out that means that you can't say
[1:51:13] something you can't take a word or add
[1:51:15] to or take away because your name has
[1:51:17] been written in the Lamb's Book of Life
[1:51:19] and brother B said it's all a part of
[1:51:21] that great revelation and it was made
[1:51:23] known during the time of the Seven Seals
[1:51:26] brother Wes you me tell you what we
[1:51:27] ought to do with it this morning I think
[1:51:29] we ought to take what has been made
[1:51:30] known by the angel and take it to
[1:51:33] Bethlehem that we can rejoice in it you
[1:51:35] know why because I want to be free to
[1:51:37] worship God I want to be free to have to
[1:51:40] Rejoice I want to be free to have a
[1:51:42] Revival so I think what we need to do is
[1:51:44] to stand for the word of God and to be
[1:51:47] able to take what God has given us
[1:51:48] what's been made known and take it to
[1:51:50] Bethlehem and come away rejoicing hear
[1:51:53] the voice of the Angel where he's made
[1:51:54] known the ways of God and then go to
[1:51:56] Bethlehem so it can be manifested to you
[1:51:59] as a reality don't you realize God sent
[1:52:01] an angel to make it known don't go to
[1:52:03] shalow and ask them what they think
[1:52:05] about it don't go to gilgal and don't
[1:52:06] don't go to Jerusalem and see if they
[1:52:08] agree with what the angel said but take
[1:52:10] what the angel has made known and go to
[1:52:12] the believer's Bethlehem his name is
[1:52:14] Christ Jesus and friends I declare unto
[1:52:17] you you'll come away
[1:52:19] rejoicing don't take it to a theologian
[1:52:21] don't take it to a historian
[1:52:23] take it to Christ Jesus why it's been
[1:52:25] made known and when you take it to the
[1:52:28] right place you'll leave
[1:52:30] rejoicing my think about it the
[1:52:32] Revelation take the Revelation to Christ
[1:52:35] that it can be manifested in our life
[1:52:38] I'm closing some music players want to
[1:52:40] come think about what he's made
[1:52:43] known he's made known the angel came to
[1:52:46] make known what true water baptism was
[1:52:49] you can go to all kinds of places and
[1:52:51] get all kinds of thoughts on it or you
[1:52:53] can take it to Bethlehem and come away
[1:52:56] rejoicing what the angel made known he
[1:52:58] made known The Mystery of the godhead
[1:53:00] you say where where should I take it I I
[1:53:02] got to go find out if the other people
[1:53:04] agree or if they think that right but
[1:53:05] don't take it to all them places take it
[1:53:07] to
[1:53:08] Bethlehem and you'll come away
[1:53:10] rejoicing the angel made known the the
[1:53:13] mystery of our future home that we ain't
[1:53:15] going to be some angels floating around
[1:53:16] in the clouds and passing through one
[1:53:18] another where we can't see each other
[1:53:20] said but I stood there and they come up
[1:53:21] and they greeted me what was it it was
[1:53:22] an angel of the Lord making known the
[1:53:24] mind of God said I stood there and I
[1:53:26] shook their hand our loved ones were
[1:53:28] there he said who are all you people
[1:53:31] they said where're your converts so I
[1:53:33] looked out there was millions of them
[1:53:35] what was happening why why would God
[1:53:37] send a message like that it was the
[1:53:38] angel of the Lord making known the mind
[1:53:41] of God you say brother Matt I heard it I
[1:53:45] heard the message of the
[1:53:46] Angel it's been made known unto me but
[1:53:49] now what do I do with
[1:53:51] it take take it to
[1:53:54] Bethlehem take it to Christ take it to
[1:53:57] the foot of the cross take it to Christ
[1:53:58] Jesus say Lord I Thank you for the
[1:54:00] Revelation you given me Lord I Thank you
[1:54:03] for showing me my future home when the
[1:54:06] world may wonder what it'll be like and
[1:54:08] where shall we be but I thank you for
[1:54:10] enlightening me of my future home and
[1:54:13] come away
[1:54:14] rejoicing he made known The Mystery of
[1:54:17] the book don't you realize what the
[1:54:19] angel does I love this you realize the
[1:54:22] angel in the end time the Bible would
[1:54:24] speak of that he was not an angel to
[1:54:27] bring questions many times an angel
[1:54:29] would come to ask a question could cause
[1:54:32] people to see where they were and the
[1:54:34] condition they were in and what and what
[1:54:36] was happening around them it would cause
[1:54:37] them to open their eyes but notice but
[1:54:39] when the angel comes he didn't come to
[1:54:42] ask a question he came to bring an
[1:54:43] answer to declare unto you the works of
[1:54:46] God and then God would give us a place
[1:54:49] to take it said bring it to Bethlehem
[1:54:53] Paul said having made known unto us the
[1:54:54] mystery of his will who the angel of the
[1:54:58] Lord according to the good pleasure
[1:55:00] which he hath purposed in
[1:55:02] himself that in the dispensation of the
[1:55:04] fullness of times he might gather
[1:55:06] together in one all things in Christ in
[1:55:09] the fullness of time he'll gather us all
[1:55:12] together in one place in Christ Jesus
[1:55:17] the Believers
[1:55:18] Bethlehem both they were in heaven and
[1:55:21] they that are on the Earth will be
[1:55:22] gathered in him in whom also we have
[1:55:25] obtained an inheritance being
[1:55:27] predestinated according to the purpose
[1:55:29] of him who worketh all things after the
[1:55:31] counsel of his own will that we should
[1:55:34] be to the praise of his glory who
[1:55:36] trusted in Christ do you trust him this
[1:55:39] morning you know how you know if you
[1:55:41] trust him because you take those things
[1:55:43] that have been declared unto you and you
[1:55:45] take them to him you don't go look to
[1:55:48] disprove him or try to find some thought
[1:55:51] you take it to Christ he said they
[1:55:53] trusted in Christ they trust his word
[1:55:56] they trust his leadership they trust the
[1:55:58] Holy Spirit they trust the voice of God
[1:56:01] and they show that trust by acting upon
[1:56:03] the trust that they have in him he said
[1:56:06] who trusted in him in whom we also
[1:56:09] trusted after you heard the word of the
[1:56:12] truth the gospel of your salvation you
[1:56:14] trusted in him in whom also after that
[1:56:17] you believed and you were sealed with
[1:56:19] the Holy Spirit of promise you know Paul
[1:56:21] could be standing here reading this
[1:56:23] today he could be you could be reading
[1:56:26] this to this body of people you know why
[1:56:27] this fits us today as if any Scripture
[1:56:30] ever does it's inspired for you today in
[1:56:33] whom you also trusted can you hear Paul
[1:56:35] say it in whom you also trusted after
[1:56:38] you heard the word of Truth The Gospel
[1:56:40] of your salvation in whom also after
[1:56:43] that you believed you were sealed with
[1:56:45] that Holy Spirit of Promise which is the
[1:56:48] earnest of your inheritance until the
[1:56:51] Redemption of that purchased possession

[2:05:11] gain inspiration isn't it wonderful this
[2:05:13] morning you love the Lord amen just want
[2:05:17] to reminder Wednesday night service has
[2:05:20] been moved to TU Tuesday
[2:05:22] night also want to make an announcement
[2:05:25] to the church just want to go over uh
[2:05:28] we've been we've been looking for a new
[2:05:32] new pews for the church and had a church
[2:05:35] that uh sister debet actually found that
[2:05:39] uh they had brand they were putting
[2:05:40] chairs in their church and so they had
[2:05:42] really nice pews they were kind of
[2:05:44] outdated on the color and everything but
[2:05:46] U but they actually donated them to the
[2:05:48] church so uh we went up with some
[2:05:50] brothers and picked them all up there
[2:05:51] there's 29 of them in
[2:05:53] total and um so we we had brought them
[2:05:56] here just thinking it was something that
[2:05:58] we could use to buy them new uh it's up
[2:06:01] the 30 to the $40,000 range uh to have
[2:06:04] them built uh the way we would like to
[2:06:06] have them but uh these had they great
[2:06:08] cushions great great support I put one
[2:06:10] out there in the forer that's not to be
[2:06:12] left there that ain't we we ain't
[2:06:13] changing the rock wall and we ain't
[2:06:15] giving the brothers a resting place at
[2:06:17] the end of the service while their wives
[2:06:18] are talking so it's just a Pew I wanted
[2:06:21] everybody to be able to see it we had a
[2:06:23] brother that took it and painted it the
[2:06:25] paint's expensive for that cabinet grade
[2:06:27] paint I believe it was I believe what he
[2:06:28] told me was around $150 a gallon to get
[2:06:30] the paint but they have to be
[2:06:32] disassembled uh the ends of them and the
[2:06:34] legs of them you'll see what they'll
[2:06:35] look like outside uh but he gave us a
[2:06:38] good price to to refurbish all the pews
[2:06:40] and so uh we'll be able to bring them in
[2:06:42] the sanctuary and it's actually enough
[2:06:44] pews that whenever we expand the walls
[2:06:46] of the sanctuary it's enough to do the
[2:06:48] whole church when we add the the extra
[2:06:50] 30 foot in width to the sanctuary will
[2:06:52] have the pews to be able to do it all
[2:06:54] and so that's what we've been uh been
[2:06:56] looking for so uh the brother would give
[2:06:58] us a price at $100 per Pew to do that so
[2:07:01] I uh it takes several hours to take them
[2:07:04] and sand them down and and to paint them
[2:07:06] he has to take them apart uh or or we're
[2:07:08] going to have to take them apart so uh
[2:07:10] we but we had uh he had gave us a price
[2:07:12] I told him I'd bring it before the
[2:07:13] church um it's something that we want to
[2:07:15] be able to do I spoke with the uh
[2:07:18] trustees about it about us getting the
[2:07:20] pews and everything and so um what we
[2:07:22] want to do is give the church an
[2:07:23] opportunity to to give toward it I
[2:07:26] Brothers came up with all sorts of ideas
[2:07:28] brother brother John was going to tell
[2:07:30] you all that this morning I think his
[2:07:31] wife left sick um but um but just uh uh
[2:07:35] you know we don't want to have no set
[2:07:37] price some people pay for so many or
[2:07:38] nothing like that we just want to leave
[2:07:40] it as an open offering if you have
[2:07:42] something you want to give towards it
[2:07:43] it'll be it'll be $22,900 to do all 29
[2:07:46] pews um but uh I want you to go out
[2:07:49] there and see what you're investing in
[2:07:51] before before you before you do it so
[2:07:52] just go out and you can sit in and look
[2:07:54] at it the rest of them are all in the
[2:07:55] back uh and he said if we could do that
[2:07:57] quickly uh and we take them in the
[2:07:59] fellowship hall we'll take the ends off
[2:08:01] of them he showed me how to take them
[2:08:02] apart so uh we can get together in one
[2:08:05] afternoon and take the ends and
[2:08:06] everything off he'll come and pick up
[2:08:08] the ends take them all to their shop get
[2:08:10] them all painted bring them back and
[2:08:11] help assemble them and make them look
[2:08:13] like they are in the foer uh and he said
[2:08:15] he could have that done before our
[2:08:16] meetings so if that's if that's
[2:08:18] something that we can have the funds to
[2:08:20] be able to put towards if we can raise
[2:08:23] the money to do it then we'll put it
[2:08:25] we'll get to work on it right away and
[2:08:26] try to get them in the church and so I
[2:08:29] don't know about y'all but uh we've been
[2:08:31] y are some gracious people this church
[2:08:33] is filled with people that's been
[2:08:35] sitting on teeter totter pews uh I don't
[2:08:37] know if y'all ever sit on one end and
[2:08:39] got swung to the other but sometimes
[2:08:41] people get a little excited and they
[2:08:42] they jump up and sit back down the other
[2:08:44] person jumps I think everybody just
[2:08:45] praising the Lord and really they're on
[2:08:46] a teeter totter the more they just go at
[2:08:48] it like man they're just back and forth
[2:08:50] Just praising the Lord but you know
[2:08:51] these these pews came out of a a wooden
[2:08:53] church that was unleveled and so some of
[2:08:55] them were saw off different levels or
[2:08:57] concrete's actually level it's not the
[2:08:59] concrete that's unleveled it's the pews
[2:09:00] that we got so uh these new ones they
[2:09:03] come off of a concrete slab they were
[2:09:05] all level they're all they're all nice
[2:09:06] they're in very great condition so uh we
[2:09:09] look forward to having them in the
[2:09:10] church I want you to look at it and uh
