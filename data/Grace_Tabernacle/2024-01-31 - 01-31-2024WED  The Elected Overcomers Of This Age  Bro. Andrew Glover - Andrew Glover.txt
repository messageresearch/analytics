to a Rapture amen we want to say God bless you all this evening ma hadn't it just been a wonderful song service tonight to hear the Believers amen singing the songs of Zion and we've been taught that the atmosphere gets created and the Lord comes down in the middle of the atmosphere and he does the exceedingly abundantly above all that we could ask or think and I believe that's what we're here tonight for him to do is to manifest himself Among Us amen if you have your Bibles tonight I want to invite you the scriptures I realize it's a Wednesday evening so we want to go straight to the word we don't want to hold you too long I I don't want to get a reputation of being a pharaoh preacher and not letting God's people go amen so if you have your Bibles tonight we're going to go to the Book of John the 16th chapter and while you're turning there tonight we do want to say God bless you and we sure thank brother Matt for the opportunity to be here this week and the invitation to speak to you and pray that something was said Sunday to be a blessing to you and a help and and encourage and amen we sure love and appreciate the assembly here and we appreciate the opportunity to be here tonight and sure appreciate all that you do for the kingdom of God and we're just asking God's richest blessings up on Grace Tabernacle and amen to see so many new faces coming in my amen it's a good thing to be in a Revival amen amen we sure appreciate brother Matt and his stand for this word and this weekend Lord will and we'll actually be up at brother Ben's for some meetings there brother Sean will be coming in for the weekend too so amen you all remember in prayer there amen but tonight we just have a few things here to speak to and if you would just bow your hearts with us before you open the word and how many just say Lord speak to me from your word amen I believe he's able to Heavenly Father Lord as your Believers have gathered here on this Wednesday afternoon Lord no doubt tired in their bodies maybe some weary in their spirits but Lord we are very well aware tonight that we're not gathered here out of form or fashion we're not gathered here out of tradition but Lord we're gathered here because your word said not to forsake the assembling of ourselves together and Lord you commissioned us even that much more as we see the day approaching and Lord I believe we've come here tonight father not to see a man or to hear from a man but Lord to see you and to hear from your word now father I pray that you would come in the meeting tonight by your omnipotent power and may you drive out every spirit that would try to torment the precious people of god father I pray that Lord as we would Minister your word you would help us to get ourselves out of the way Lord that you you could speak through me but Lord may you not just speak through me father but may you hear through the Believers Lord and may this be more than just a Wednesday night service father but Lord may we lay aside the heaviness may we lay aside the cares of life and father for just the next few moments may we enter into that realm Lord where all things are possible father as it were as Abraham Drew upon elshad Lord may we break into that realm tonight and draw strength out of your bosom father into our lives that Lord we could leave here better Christians better Believers Lord father I pray that you would strengthen everyone they being sick among us Lord may you heal them tonight dear God Have Your Way among us and we'll be sure to give thee all the praise all the honor and all the glory in the wonderful name of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ we pray and all the Believers says amen and amen The Book of John the 16th chapter and in the 33rd verse Jesus here is speaking he says these things I have spoken unto you that in me you might have peace now in the world ye shall have tribulation so here he's separating those that are in him and those that are in the world and he's saying in the world you shall have tribulation but be of good cheer for I have overcome the world Amen could we read that verse together I have overcome the world that's more than just words to me that's a promise amen if you're in him he has overcome the world now in the Book of Revelation the thirr chapter Revelation the 3r chapter and in the 21st verse Revelation 3 and verse number 21 uh the Bible here again Jesus speaking to the lay odyssean Church age in Revelation 3 and verse 21 uh the Bible here Jesus is speaking and he's given us some very powerful promises and I love this because here he says to him that overcometh will I grant to sit with me in my throne even as I also overcame and am sat down with my father in his throne now brother BR said that's not to the group that's to the individual so we could very well very well say to the individual that overcometh will I grant to sit with me in my throne even as I also overcame and am sat down with my father in his throne and he says he that hath an ear let him hear what the spirit saith unto the church now brother REM said he that has an ear he said that's the individual not the whole group the individual that's the bride coming out the church amen we ask the Lord this evening to add the blessing to the reading of his word as you can have your seats here uh this evening I want you by the help of the Lord for just a few moments if I could to speak to you tonight and I just pray that we can say something to be a blessing and a help to you but if I will title this tonight I want to speak to you on the elected Overcomers of this age amen the elected Overcomers of this age and I maybe just draw this from a thought out of the message Faith 1956 brother R said here I am standing here just yielding myself and the Holy Spirit to moving and this is what you call Heavenly places in Christ Jesus but remember Satan's always skeptic at the sons of God Amen remember Satan is always skeptical of the sons of God you know he always does that someone with a skeptic idea he said and when they do that he's just trying to interfere amen but Christians always overcome amen amen the devil is trying to interfere but Christians always overcome amen let me ask you how many Christians do we have here tonight amen then if you are a Christian there is not a possibility you will overcome amen but Christians always overcome again he says and how can I overcome now remember amen that Christ spoke of an elected people amen for this last day now we know there's seven Gentile Church ages right amen all the way from Ephesus un Leota and we're not in Ephesus we're not in thara we're not in we're not even in the Philadelphian age amen but according to the word we have come to the last Church age which is the leoan age amen which is the end time or is the time of the fullness of all things amen and it is a time where there was elected in Ephesus there was elected in samna there was elected in every age so in this last day amen there's got to be an elected people that will overcome now I don't know maybe how you feel about yourself but I believe that I'm speaking to Caleb's amen the Bible said in numbers 13:30 amen that Caleb stealed the people before Moses and said these words he said let us go up at once amen and possess it for we are well able to overcome it amen I love the words of Caleb we are well able to overcome it there was no hesitation in Caleb's confession there was no question mark in Caleb's confession amen when Caleb stealed the people he gave him a direct order and said now listen we are well able to overcome it that word overcome means to Prevail it means to overcome amen I love this it means to endure it means to have power it means to be able to gain or to accomplish something it is to be able to endure it is to be able to reach to Prevail over against something it is to overcome to be the victory Amen to have the ability and the strength to overcome amen there was a mouthful said in those words amen we are well able to endure it we are well able to overcome it we are well able to take the land we are well able amen we have the strength we have the ability amen now tonight I want to tell you Grace Tabernacle amen Caleb is not here but the spirit of Caleb is in this building amen and there is an announcement from the word that we are well able to overcome Le oosa amen I know that you wish you could get saved and tomorrow go in the Rapture amen but you would not be an overcomer amen if God saved you the very day and raptured you the same day amen but if he saved you you got to go through some things amen but here's the Glorious thing about it he did not save you amen hoping you would be able to overcome and to come into the inheritance but he saved you amen knowing that you were well able to overcome Le amen I am persuaded of better things about you tonight Church amen you are well able to overcome the devil you are well able to overcome sin you are well able to overcome situation amen because the word said we are well able how many agrees with me we are well aable amen amen not we're going to be but we are amen not we might be but we are we are well able to overcome now in 1 John 2:13 the Bible says I write unto you fathers amen because you have known him that is from the beginning somebody say the beginning amen you have known him from the beginning now I write unto you young men amen because ye have overcome the wicked one I write unto you little children amen because you have known the father verse 14 amen I have written unto you fathers because you have known him that is from the beginning now watch what John is doing amen he's bringing the God that was in the beginning amen all the way to the present amen but he's addressing a group of people that would be in the last days amen when the Antichrist Spirit would come into full effect amen but at the same time the Antichrist Spirit would be coming into full effect there would be a bride who would be moving into the revelation of the sons of God and she would be well able to overcome the Antichrist she would be well able to overcome the devil listen I don't know about you tonight but I think we need to shake it off and remember amen that we are well able to overcome amen we are well able to overcome deception we are well able to overcome situations amen we are well able to overcome bad days and bad feelings amen we're well able to overcome bad attitudes we're well able to overcome sin amen because God has sent us a message and it's not a temporary message it's an eternal message and it has come from the God that was in the beginning and the God that was in the alpha has now become Omega and the same power that was in the beginning is now here in the end I write unto you amen cuz you have known him that is from the beginning I have written to you young men because you are strong amen and the word of God abideth in you amen young men let me say this you're not weaklings Amen to the world you may be weaklings amen but under this message you are strong amen because the word of God is abiding in you and ye have overcome the wicked one do you realize before you was ever born this was written about you amen before you ever come on the earth Carter amen the word said you overcome the wicked one and here you are years later manifesting what the word prophesied you would do Church of the Living God we're not here playing church we are a prophetic class of people that have stepped from the pages of the book and we are here manifesting God Amen not as they overcome but as the Overcomers amen you are strong because the word of God abideth in you and ye have overcome the wicked one I love that because the same words that Jesus used amen it's the same words John used and Jesus said I have overcome the world and here John is saying you have overcome the world Amen now how could he say that amen because the God that was in Jesus is the same God that's in the bride and if God overcome in Jesus he's going to overcome in you amen there's not one Holy Ghost for the prophet and one Hol I feel like preaching tonight and not one Holy Ghost for the young people amen but the same Holy Ghost amen that Jesus received on the River Jordan is the same Holy Ghost every SE gen of God has received and what the Holy Ghost did in Jesus the Holy Ghost will do in you if the Holy Ghost overcome in him the Holy Ghost has to overcome in you if it's the same Holy Ghost ye have overcome the wicked one brother Bram says faith is our Victory he says now Faith is a conqueror how many can testify that faith is a conqueror amen he said faith is an overcomer it isn't just a peacemaker it over comes amen now can I say this there's a time to make peace and there's a time to declare war there's a time to make peace with the devil but then there's other times that you got to say devil you've gone as far as you're going to go I have been anointed I have been elected I have been chosen Amen to overcome you amen the word speaks of better things than me I'm I want to say to you tonight if you're under the devil amen the word speaks of better things of you if you're under his negativity and his depression and his doom and his Gloom the word I'm preaching amen speaks better things of you it speaks of joy unspeakable it speaks of peace and power and authority listen we ain't got to back up to the devil we are strong because the word of God is abiding in the Church of God which is causing you to overcome faith is a conqueror faith is an overcomer faith is the victory that overcomes the world what does it do he said what is Faith what is the conquer amen conquer and victory is the same y'all ready for this definition he said to conquer it means to beat down it means to override it means to handcuff and to throw in prison you know what some of y'all need to do tonight you need to beat that devil down you need to override that devil you need to handcuff that devil and you need to put that devil in prison amen the word doesn't speak of you being in prison but it does speak of the devil being in prison the word doesn't speak of you being bound but it does speak of the devil being bound and I think it's high time for the Church of the Living God Amen to rise up out of the conditions of life and beat that devil down and Pie that devil down and put that devil in prison it means the sin that once ruled you amen you now rule it well glory to God the sin that once ruled you he said you rule it now it means you've overcome it you have whipped it are you ready for this you're greater than it is well that's a shouting point right there you're greater than it is the unbelief that once ruled you amen through the Holy Ghost amen through the word that abides in you you have beat it down you have whipped it you have handcuffed it you have put it in prison and David Paul you are greater than it you are greater than the sin you are greater than the unbelief come on I'm saying you church I don't look at you by the way you look at yourself I look at you by the word and I say you're greater than what you've been through you're greater than what you're facing you're greater than what the devil's telling you you're greater than what the devil's trying to convince you you are an overcomer and if you ever come alive to the Revelation that in you is somebody greater and stronger and mightier than the devil you will overcome every devil because you're greater than it is I love what brother man preaches he says how can I overcome he said I chose this because I think it's a time that we should never let the spirit of Revival die we've got to keep in Revival constantly revived every day because Paul said he had to Die daily that Christ could live and we must never let that Revival amen die within us we must never let that Revival die within us again he says overcome what does it mean it means to keep life in you because when life goes out amen then that's what brought that law L into that condition but you don't know the log he's talking about he said I stepped on that log and he said when I stepped on it it give way he said what happened to it he said at one time you could step on it and then you could walk on it he said but it fell down and life left it and when life left it it came into an old Doty condition he said so now it can't handle nothing amen and the first time you step on it or you don't shake its hand or you don't visit it or you don't pat it on the back amen it falls apart and goes home amen but we're not a bunch of Doty logs amen we're Overcomers and we have learned how to keep life in US amen is it easy brother Joe no amen it's hard amen sometimes we got to sacrifice sometimes we got to die out to ourselves amen sometimes we got to take our flesh and we got to crucify our flesh amen but I say there's a blessing Amen in crucifying your flesh Paul said that I might die that Christ might live in me I say tonight Church Jesus Crucify My My Flesh that you might live through me because I am an overcomer now in Revelation three we read about the Overcomer but what I love about it is we don't stop at the Overcomer but Jesus speaks of the throne and he said said did you notice the arrangements of that see amen sat with me in my Throne amen not on my throne but in my Throne amen see that is in his domain he said and now as Christ is the ruler he is the throne ruler at this time amen of the complete domain of God Amen so will the church be with him amen the bride be with him in his throne in the entire domain see not on my throne but in my Throne somebody say that with me Amen in my Throne amen not on the throne but in my Throne see amen where his domain reaches he said now what is a throne amen a throne is over a domain and a domain reaches as far amen as its boundaries does amen and this is from eternity to Eternity amen so we're not talking amen about a temporary Kingdom with a temporary king with a temporary dominion and temporary subjects but we are speaking about an eternal God and that's why John said amen you have known him from the beginning because the one that was at the beginning has come to the ending and you are just as much a part of him in the end as you was in the beginning amen you got SE life on the inside of you and there is a representation in your soul that is greater than anything you've been through anything you're going through or anything we will go through we are a part of a domain now as Believers Church we have a Dominion as Believers we have a Dominion Romans 6:14 says amen that sin amen shall not have dominion over you you for ye are not under the law but you are under grace amen sin shall not have dominion over you amen but ye are not under law you are under grace brother said our Dominion is the dominion over sin and it is enforced through the power that is in the spirit of Christ that indwells us see every Kingdom on Earth is going to be tored down amen but ours will remain now this scripture here is speaking amen of us being Kings over a Dominion amen and not under law but under grace amen can I say this to you amen you are Kings in the present as well as in the future according to Revelation 1:5 amen the Bible said from Jesus Christ who is the faithful witness the first begotten of the Dead the prince of the kings of the earth unto him that loved us amen and washed us from our sins in his own blood look at verse six and hath made us amen Kings and Priests unto God and his father to him be glory and Dominion forever and ever amen I want you to catch these words the Bible says he hath made us I love what brother said he said there are certain truths that we need to emphasize and this is one of them that he hath made us amen that's a that's a that's an emphasizing Point amen that we didn't make ourselves amen but he hath made us amen salv is his doing salvation is of the Lord amen it is all of Grace he redeemed us for a purpose he bought us for a purpose and we are Kings and spiritual Kings amen now can I break something down to you can I break the present down to you and the future said oh we are going to be Kings upon the Earth with him when he sits on the throne so what the devil does is the devil says well in the future you're going to be kings in the future you're going to Reign amen so don't worry about it right now but brother said but now we are spiritual Kings and we are reigning over a spiritual Kingdom according to Romans 5:17 if by one man's offense death reigned by one then much more they which received abundance of Grace and of the gift of righteousness shall reign in life amen by one Jesus Christ amen then this word I'm speaking about amen abides in you and it came into you and it broke the curse of the law off of you and transferred you or translated you amen from the kingdom of darkness into the reign of his glorious son listen you're not going to be victorious when the Rapture takes place you're not going to be victorious when you make it to heaven but right here tonight amen by the word of the Lord You Are Spiritual Kings and spiritual priests and you are victorious right here right now regardless of how you feel regardless of what you think regardless of what you see the word has has prophesied over you you are spiritual Kings and you're reigning over a spiritual Kingdom amen right now we reign with Christ right now we reign with Christ amen having dominion over sin over the world and the Flesh and the devil that's what the devil don't want you to realize is right here right now you have dominion over sin you have dominion over the world you have dominion over the Flesh and the devil and what are you doing you are showing forth his praise and glory you are showing forth himself for it is Christ in us somebody say Christ in US amen that is willing and doing of his good pleasure yes indeed even now we are seated in Heavenly places in Christ Jesus amen then can I identify you by the word you are the Overcomer amen somebody help me preach tonight and say I am the Overcomer I am amen some of y'all still sitting there with your m M Clos I am the Overcomer you know why you're not saying that because you don't feel like it amen you don't think like it you don't see how it could be amen but sometime or another church you got to divorce your thoughts you got to forsake your ideas you got to forsake your ideas amen and embrace what the word says and the word says you are the Overcomer amen and the Overcomer has a dominion over the devil over sin over the world over the flesh amen right here tonight the devil is defeated amen and Jesus Christ is victorious in the reign of the Bride of Jesus Christ I'm not talking to church members I'm talking to Overcomers I'm not talking to citizens of Arkansas I'm talking to Overcomers and the prophet said the Overcomer amen is the heir of all things amen you know people I don't see what's the matter with you as Christians he said that you don't walk around a little while and see what you own now come on if you found out if you found out that somebody died and left you air to everything that was in Bass Pro or everything that was Amen in some shopping mall down in Jonesburg or somewhere amen you wouldn't go in there and stand at the door and say Well it must be nice amen but you're going to walk around and you're going to see what you air to well listen Jesus Christ died amen that every promise in this book might be fulfilled in us then I think it's high time to put our walking shoes on and start walking around in the promise land I think it's time to start walking around we are not the inheritors of depression we are not the inheritors of condemnation we are not the inheritors of sickness but we are the sons of God and we are the inheritors of joy unspeakable we are the inheritors of peace that passes all understanding we are the inheritors of revelation we are the inheritors of anointing we have not been put in Leota to be subjected to the king of Leota we have been put in leot see it to subject amen the God of this evil age Amen to the word of God and walk over that devil on Monday walk over that devil on Tuesday walk over that devil on Friday walk over that devil come on put your walking shoes on and start walking over that devil as Overcomers you're not defeated you're Overcomers and you're air to more than what you're letting the devil tell you you're heir to now the prophet said this is the age of the Overcomer he said now look Canaan does not represent the age of the Millennium it only represents the age of the Overcomer the dispensation of overcoming because in Canaan they killed and they burned and took cities but there'll be no death in the Millennium so right now amen so many promises have been laid in the future and people says in the millennium youall heard that hadn't you in the Millennium in the future someday some hour some time but here's what I say we won't need Divine Healing in the Millennium we won't need breakthroughs in the Millennium come on church we won't need we won't need miracles in the Millennium we won't need to get together and overcome our flesh to have a good service in the I'm preaching to you amen right now is when we need you to be an overcomer right now is when we need you to come in on Wednesday night and the world's sitting on your shoulders and everything's on your mind but you realize you're not subject to it you are an overcomer and you begin to pull on the word you begin to pull on the Holy Ghost and you begin to leave the Earthly places and move into Heavenly Places come on now's the time that we need a display of overcoming in The Bride of Jesus Christ right now is the time we need healing right now is the time we need to cast out Devils come on church now is the age of the over Overcomer it's not in the future it's right now you say brother Ander I'm waiting on the Millennium to fight amen we're not waiting on the millenum to fight amen now is the time to fight come on church now is the time to fight brother Wesley right now is the time to fight right now is the time Amen to draw your sword and fight back against that devil the prophet said Now's the Time where we have to fight to win the battle and to overcome the things to the world see there won't be any fighting there there won't be any fighting in the Millennium well brother and I'm waiting until I get in the Millennium and then I'm going to fight you will never be a fighter because there'll be no fighting in the Millennium the last prayer will be made there won't be no prayer meetings there'll be no more place for the people to get saved there'll be no sickness to be healed it'll just be one great glorious thing see what could we as human beings this morning what could we promise what could we look at anything that would be any greater than looking to that promise of that time so here's a prophet saying that the promise of that time is the door to that time oh God the promise of that time is the door to that time in other words this message is the door to the Millennium come on everything that's in this message is the door to the Future home is the door sister toys to the body change is the door to the Rapture is the door to the resurrection but if the devil can you not to fight now then you're never going to get there but I say this is a special time this is adoption time this is a time where we don't lay down to the devil we stand up to him this is a time where we don't take a back seat and say well maybe next Sunday I'll try again or next week I'll try again amen but this is the time that we stand Toe to Toe with that devil as manifested sons of God and we manifest our adoption now you say brother Andrew what is his spiritual adoption well the prophet of God said in Romans 8:14 he picks it up and says as many as are led by the spirit of God they are the sons of God now watch verse 15 for ye have not received the spirit of bondage again to fear but ye have received the spirit of adoption amen whereby we cry Abby father so we have not receive the spirit amen a bondage again to fear because we are Overcomers and we overcome the fear we have overcome the bondage and we have made our way to the inheritance of the spirit of adoption and it's changed our vocabulary and we now cry AB by father now brother said I'm only saying this not to mix up Doctrine but to straighten it out see that we might get away from this fear and scare you don't know who you are amen you don't know who you are he said you're not going to be amen but now you are the sons of God an't that beautiful you're not going to be but now you are the sons of God now watch what a prophet says see you always were the sons of God you always were the sons of God in other words you are the sons of God by the seed of God and brother man picks this up in Cross the mystery he said you're already his by predestination so tonight Church we're not fighting whether we're his or not brother Harvey a prophet has come among the church and has settled the dispute of who we belong to we're not here tonight trying to get identified brother Jared we're not here ton not trying Amen to get somebody to claim us as their child but a Prophet come in this age and said if you ever was a Son of God you always was a Son of God if you ever was a daughter of God you always was a daughter of God listen and bad days don't change that come on Grace Tabernacle bad days don't change that mistakes don't change that habits don't change that besetting sins don't change that amen feelings don't change that Emotions Don't Change that it is settled tonight if the seed of God remaineth in your heart then you are the sons of God oh come on church amen and you're not going to be but now you are manifesting the nature of the seed that's on the inside of you amen that seed has come to life no world can get in see and cry in his alone it's already finished amen the seed was there amen can we move on to another battle can we move on from the Battle of one day I'm a son and the next day I'm not can we move on to a battle from one day I'm Scot seed and the next day I'm serpent seed can we move on from that battle church and can we move into adoption where we know who we are regardless of what we're going through now I know what I'm talking about cuz if you're going to walk in Victory you got to be in Victory Victory and victory is in Jesus Christ and if you're in Jesus Christ the Bible said there is therefore now no condemnation to them that are in Christ Jesus who walk not according to this world but according to the spirit of life now listen you got to change who you're walking with you got to change who you're fellowshipping with you got to quit fellowshipping with the god of your past you got to quit fellowshipping with the god that don't want you to come to Victory you got to quit fellowshipping with the spirit that don't want you to manifest what the word is said will able to overcome amen you got to change your walking Partners you got to start walking with this message you got to walk with it on Monday you got to walk with it on Tuesday you got to walk with it on Wednesday you got to walk with it on Saturday I'm on I know what I'm talking about amen when you get home from church on Sunday and the Devil comes in like a Russian wind and begins to bombard your mind with questions and bombard your mind with an identity crisis you got to put your walking shoes on and walk with this message amen walk with a God who is rich in Mercy walk with a God who is the god of the Masterpiece walk with a God who said I'll never leave you I'll never forsake you you got to walk with God Church listen I'm trying to help you here tonight you got to move beyond the Battle of am I son or not now don't get mad at me there's bigger battles brother Joel there's bigger battles there's bigger battles to face than whether I'm a Son of God or not see the seed was already when was it put there are you ready for this before the foundation of the world predestinated unto eternal life the seed was not put in your head so that this would be a head decision the seed was put in your heart because this is not an intellectual decision this is a supernatural decision because see you are God's spiritual church amen can I preach to you now he said said we are God's spiritual church with a spiritual law that is written on the table of our hearts and we are LED in a spiritual form now if you can accept this message I don't know if you can put the picture up with the pillar of fire amen but if you can accept this message amen as the visible Return of the literal presence of God into this generation you will conquer a battle are you ready for this you will conquer a battle now you know what battle you'll conquer you will conquer the Battle of well I got saved and everything's going to be easy I got the Holy Ghost now everything's going to be a flowery bed of easy but you will come to a quick Revelation that you didn't get saved and go to a picnic you got saved and went to a battlefield come on now you didn't get saved and go in a bubble and now God's going to roll you through Leota and brother Jared ain't going to be no problems ain't going to be no bad days no you got to realize what the prophet said he said this people who follow the pillar of fire will certainly have a rough time have I got any Witnesses here that you've had a rough time since you put your walking shoes on and started following the pillar of fire you've had a rough time but here's what I love about it but they'll be ready for the translation at that time they'll be ready to go come on church if you can fall in line behind the pillar of fire if you can fall in line behind the headship if you can fall in line behind the one who put the seed in your soul you're going to have a rough time but when translation time comes you're going to be ready for the Rapture because you've been trained on how to go through bad days and still bless the name of the Lord you've been trained on how to have battles and come out on the other side Victorious you're going to have a rough time but think God will be ready for the translation at that time Hallelujah going to be a rough time but we're going to be ready for translation come on Church going to be some hard days but you know what you ought to do you ought to get on the page with Paul when he said the sufferings of this present time are not worthy to be compared with the glory which shall be revealed in us now come on what's going to reveal That Glory Victory under Victory under Victory you're going to have a hard time young people you're going to have a hard time but just rejoice in this you'll be ready at that time for the translation thank you Brothers amen now I'll say this with that Revelation in our hearts then now we are walking with the Revelation that we are the children of God by promise and Grace how many can say Amen we are the children by promise and by Grace Paul said if children and HS and Heirs of God and join HS with Christ amen there's a good anointing in here and the devil don't like it if so be that we suffer with him that we may be also glorified together now watch what Paul says for I reckon that the sufferings of this present time are not worthy to be compared with the glory which shall be revealed in US brother said the church is growing see each age it's allotted in the scripture here so God through the Holy Spirit Reveals His word by manifesting it and vindicating it himself and amen showing that it's his word being brought to pass in the day that it's promised now can I say this that we are living in the season we're church we are moving from just having expectations that we're actually walking in the manifestation of our expectation is that okay we're living in a season where we're not just gathered on Wednesdays and gathered on Sundays and compiling a bunch of expectations but we're living in the season amen where those expectations are manifestations can I prove it to you Grace Tabernacle just a few years ago you had a prayer board out there and you had some names on it that were expectations of prodical coming home but tonight their names are not out there as expectation but they're sitting here in the building as manifestation now come on Amen who brought that to pass Matt didn't do it I didn't do it a been no other preacher done it but somebody was following the pillar of fire and they realized they was going to have a rough way there was going to be some days the devil said they'll never come in there was going to be some days the devil said they'll never be saved amen but here they are tonight amen to show that they stood in line behind the headship of the pillar of fire and God had the ability to transform the expectations into manifestation now can I say this Paul said that the earnest expectation of the creature is waiting for what the manifestation of the sons of God look at this word manifest station it means to be revealed so the creature is waiting for the Revelation to be revealed to the sons of God now you all got a series called adoption right preached it in 1960 can I give you a few quotes from that paragraph 47 part two he said now and in the Bible we're living in the last days we're at the top of the pyramid sea the cross Fishers of the cancer age in the Zodiac in the time of the coming of the Leo the line in the capping Stone amen and in the days of the manifestation of the sons of God in the Bible seat paragraph uh 215 part three but this is the day this is the day this is the day of the manifestation of the sons of God when the Mysteries that's been hid since before the foundation of the world is to be made known this is the hour paragraph 76 part 4 now this may choke you to death but did you know that men that are sons of God brother Mark were amateur your Gods how many ever know that how many knew that that Jesus said amen did not your law say itself you're gods and if you call them Gods now watch which God said in Genesis 2 that they were Gods because they had full domain over the Dominion of the world see he give him dominion over all things but he lost his godship he lost his sunship he lost his domain and Satan took it over can I say why every one of us was born in sin shaping iniquity and come in the world speaking lies amen it was not just because of who our mom and daddy was it was because all the way back in the Garden of Eden amen Adam gave up his godship he gave up his sunship he gave up his dominion and Satan took it over he said but brother we are waiting for the manifestation of the sons of God who will come back and will take it over again that's why the devil hates you is because you are in the jeans seed line amen of God who created Adam Oh Glory to God and now you're in manifestation by the revealing of the word to walk up to the devil and not make a deal with the devil but say give it back give it back come on I'm preaching to you church amen some of you need to walk up to the devil tonight and say give it back you need to say give me my Revival back give me my joy back give me my peace back come on I'm preaching to you give me my anointing back give me my Liberty back give me my praise back give me my worship back give me my shout back you're in position to do it wish what the prophet said what are they waiting for the fullness of time when the pyramid gets up to the top when the full sons of God will be manifested when the power of God brother Noah will walk out do you realize what you are you are a living walking manifestation amen I'm trying to behave tonight you are a living walking manifestation of the power of God brother Andrew prove that from the Bible amen you shall receive power after the Holy Ghost has come upon you if you got the Holy Ghost tonight you're not just a walking human you are a walking exposition of the power of God listen there's something in you that the devil's scared of that's why the devil don't want you to get up in the morning it's C in your body is the food of the godhead in your body is the power Amen to take back everything that the devil's stole from you are you hearing me when the manifested who is the manifested Sons I believe it's you I believe I'm looking at the manifested sons of God and the prophet said brother Jonah that they'll walk out and they'll take back from the devil what he took from them every Power that Satan's got you will take it away from him in other words you will change from being powerless to being powerful and he will become powerless Grace Tabernacle If I Was the Devil I would fight this church too because God has raised you up and has anointed you with a word anointing with a manifested son anointing and you're not out here playing Church you're not out here just trying to do something for God you are doing something for God you are doing something you're tearing the devil's Kingdom down you're taking back babies you're taking back families you're recovering testimonies you're restoring confessions because the power of God has come into you by the revelation of the word of God and the devil's tried to defeat it but he is defeated and we are the Overcomers we are the Overcomers of the devil we are the Overcomers of sin we are the Overcomers of the world we are the Overcomers and the devil can't stop it hell can't bind it the Grave can't hold it Spirits can't defeat it we are victorious through the blood of Jesus I'm not a crazy man I'm an overcomer you're not fanatical you're Overcomers change your identity Church change your confession well I'm a member of Grace Tabernacle won't you change that to I'm an overcomer of Grace Tabernacle why don't you change that well I'm just a church member why don't you change that to I'm a messiah come on I'm talking to you why don't you change that from well I'm just barely getting by to saying I'm drinking from an inexhaustible Fountain I've got unlimited resources I'm swimming in the unsearchable [Applause] riches make the devil powerless and you become powerful and walk up to that devil and take back every Power now I know what that devil says brother Xavier he says you don't have a right to take it back but I happen to believe a prophet who said it belonged to you before it belonged to him come on brother Mark we're not taking back something that didn't belong to us we're taking back what was always well I feel good on that point amen I'm not stealing the shout I'm taking the shout back I'm not stealing the anointing I'm taking the anointing back come on that devil says don't you take your babies from me I will take them from him because they never belong to him they always belong to God and as long as I've got adoption Authority in my body I'm going to overcome that Devil by the manifestation of the revelation of the word of God in the age I'm living [Applause] in Hallelujah go right back to Genesis to the original what is it now the world nature is groaning and crying for it everything's moving for it for the manifestation of the sons of God when true Sons born Sons filled Sons Church give me some preaching room when born Sons true Sons field Sons they're coming they're coming they're coming that's why you can't get no power overcome it's CA the devil's convinced you they're coming and blinded you to the Revelation you are them come on they're not coming they're here born sons are here sister Joyce filled sons are here true sons are here now the problem of God said true Sons born Sons filled Sons speak and there word is backed I believe we're on the border of it right now 1960 brother Jared we was on the border of it brother Wesley how big can that border be if we was on the border of it in 1960 I believe brother Randall I can say tonight we're in the land of it now if we were on the border the spoken word in the 60s can I not say what Caleb said can I not steal you tonight and say we're now well aable to overcome the devil that tried to keep us at kades barnea we're well able tonight to go into the land now come on church when we get in the land we're not just going to stand there and look at everything in the land but God brought us in the land to possess the land and whatever is in the land we have a right to accept it I'm preaching to you we have the right to go in the land and access what is in there that we're air to you know why because the Bible said that M I'm running out of time but Matthew 21 the Bible says that the people were standing around and they were under expectation of the son s o n of God they were waiting for his arrival Matthew 21 calls it the triumphal entry of Jesus into the city but can I move from Matthew 21 and say but we're now in Romans 8 were they're not under the arrival of the S so n of God he's already arrived brother Morgan now the world is charged now I know I know you're going to f I'm Plum slap crazy but can I tell you somebody that pulls harder than you testing one two can I tell you somebody that out pulls you all can I tell you who they are you ready it's some trees out there oh you said brother Andrew you just going to call some I'm talking about nature right now when you all get quiet the tree say preach it right now when you all want say Amen that you can overcome it the tree scream out Matt preach it anyhow come on church because they're waiting for you to come to the manifestation of your position so they can go back to their original position the prophet of God said it is very apparent that she ought to be called the body of Christ for whereas God was once manifested in a many member body he's now manifested in a many membered body wherein Our God was once manifested one member even our Lord Jesus Christ now can I say this Jesus will return again in flesh all believers believe that in a Corporal body that is in the future but the prophet of God said but he sent the comforter he said he came back in spirit upon the true church he is the faithful and true witness in the midst of the church but one day somebody say one one day he's going to come back in flesh again then he will prove who is the only wise potentate it is he Jesus Christ the lord of Glory now there I am I'm putting it in the future right that's future but what about now what about present tense time right now a prophet said this is my Ministry C is to declare him that he is here my min Ministry is to declare him he is here now if he is here present tense then where is he if he is here present tense then where is he the prophet said the lamb was one creature and the dove was another creature and when the Dove and the lamb United together God was manifested in the flesh but now he's manifested in your flesh by being adopted sons and daughters to the kingdom of God Amen through the baptism of the Holy Spirit that's right and you become joint HS with Christ oh church you've got the power if you got the faith to use it with I tell you why the devil's fighting you right now is because you are the super sign you are God manifested in flesh the super sign was the first man that God could come into all that God was he poured into Christ and all that Christ was he has poured into the church the super sign Oh Glory the super sign is God and man together that was to be the Super sign of the last day can I just go aad and show you what a prophet said he said when the entire Bible was to be fulfilled in the last days grace Tabernacle if you could only see who you are you are the living manifestation of the fulfill M of the entire Bible want me to prove it to you there's a David in here tonight that'll sling a slingshot there's a Samson in here it'll take a Jawbone there's a Mary in here it'll say be it unto me according to Thy word there's a Rahab in here it'll stand with a token come on Church there's a Joshua in here it'll say everywhere at the soul of your feet steps up on I've given that you is are you hearing me the entire Bible is fulfilled in the last days now can I tell you what the devil can't do he can't stop it brother beny he can't stop it he can't stop it he cannot stop every promise in this book from being fulfilled you know why because he's not dealing with hybrid Sons he's not dealing with church members he is dealing with true sons who were born sons who are filled Sons uh Romans 9:4 now can I can I can I bring this down to you can I tell you the secret of your life is that okay it's the election of God the secret of your life is the election of God Romans 9:4 Paul says to whom pertaineth the adoption in Galatians 2:4 when the fullness of time was come amen God sent forth his son made of a woman made under the law to redeem them that were under the law that we might receive receive the adoption of sons in Ephesians 1:5 having predestinated us unto the adoption of children by Jesus Christ to himself according to the good pleasure of his will adoption part two he said now can we say what brother B said your adoption is your placing it's not your birth you are a son at Birth your adoption is your positionally placed in the promise now can I say this to you will you remember this that election goes with adoption which positionally places you in your position so you can't have the adoption and skip the election and move into your position neither can you have the election and skip the adoption and move into your position but your election leads you to your adoption oh God and your adoption places you in your POS position well if I was a devil I would fight you too because you're not wondering where you belong you're standing on the infallable revelation of the manifestation of the word of God in your position showing the devil who you are Paul said in Romans 9:11 he said that the purpose of God according to election might sit might bow down to the things of the world no that you're according to election might stand not of works but of him that calleth can I read you another one Romans 11:28 as concerning the gospel they are enemies for your sake but as touching the election they are the Beloved for the father's sake can I give you another one 1 Thessalonians 1:4 knowing Brethren beloved your election is of God can we say that together your election of God look at second Peter 1:10 wherefore the Brethren Brethren give diligence to make your calling oh I'm feeling good your calling and your election sure for if you do these things ye might fall one day you might slip one day you might come up short one day ye shall never fall come on church it's time to let the calling of God anoint the election of God and Lead You by the adoption of God to your position given by God and stand there with a revelation that no matter what tomorrow holds no matter what the future holds I Know Who Holds Tomorrow can I say this I've said it many times in this church but I'm going to say it again and with that Revelation in your soul Destiny when the dust settles and the Smoke Clears you'll still be standing with that Revelation having preeminence in your soul when the battle's over brother Morgan and the Oh Glory and the dust settles and the Smoke Clears we'll still be standing on the immovable Rock of Revelation I think it's time to take our I think it's time to take our spiritual Fist and knock that devil plum in the face and say get out of my way I'm going on with Jesus just the same I'm going on though the storms come I'm going on those sickness comes I'm going on those bad days come I'm going on I'm going on let situations arise I'm going on let them scandalize my name I'm going on let them criticize us I'm going on I'm going on I'm not stopping I'm not backing up I'm going on I'm going on sis you got to go on you're elected to go on you're adopted to go on you're placed to go on you say preacher you got some victory well you got it too I said you got it too but you're letting some devil rob you of it feels pretty good in here tonight going on say what you want to I'm going on call me what you want to I'm going on talk about me if you want to I'm going on can I feel I can preach like a feeling come hell or high water I'm going on come Wars I'm going on come decisions and divisions and all kinds of confusions I'm going on let the devil rise up what he wants to around this message I'm going on I got to go on I'm going on with Jesus I'm elected to go on I'm anointed to go on somebody give him some Praise In Here somebody give him some Praise In Here somebody praise that devil come out of this building we're going on Xavier we're going on don't matter what they say about us we're going on God called us God saved us God revealed his word to us he ordained us we're going on Wesley we got to go on you're anointed to go on I can't go on the word said you can I can't make it you already did I've got too much against me no you got too much behind you I got too many spirits hanging on me no you got too many spirits broken hanging on you now either you believe it or not can I tell you what brother BR said let me back up a second give me that second Peter 1:10 I'm coming down give diligence to make your calling an election sure for if you do these things can we say that together ye shall never fall look at this word election it is the act of picking out or choosing are you ready for this it is used of the act of God's Free Will by wh now this is a Bible definition by which before the foundation of the world he decreed His blessings to certain persons so oh God so in other words here you are Matt in the end and I'm going to go as far as I can over here to show God in the beginning now Sister Karine here's the blessing there's the recipient he has been elected to receive it there's a lot of distance between me and him but he's the only one that can receive this so if it's elected for him no matter how far away he is if I had time I'd make a better illustration I'd put a lot a bunch of these young boys between me and him and show you that I could get through all of them I'm breaking ain't I I could get through all of them and still get to him in other words nothing between the time that I chose him and decreed these blessings to him could clog up the channel between he and I that could stop him from receiving what I elected for him to receive Church of the Living God do you realize what all has been between you in the beginning there's been the Old Testament there's been the Patriarchs there's been Israel and I'm skipping a bunch there's been seven Gentile ages there's been a crucifixion there's been there's been all kinds of things but here you are in the end time and nothing brother could defeat this Revelation from getting to your vessel because before the foundation of the world God decreed that you would receive this blessing oh I wish I was a preacher right now predestination will not be defeated election will not be defeated for knowledge will not be defeated are y'all ready for this God by predestination looks back to forn knowledge and for knowledge looks to destination yes sir I'm skipping over a bunch of good stuff but can I say this second Peter 1 Peter 1:1 I'm going to close on this point Peter remember we talked about him an apostle Jesus Jesus Christ to The Strangers scattered throughout I'm glad my name is Andrew verse two elect according to the forn knowledge of God the Father what are those words through sanctification of the spirit unto The Obedience and the sprinkling of the blood of Jesus Christ Grace be unto you and peace be multiplied brother BR said in other words God in order to be God he had to know everything he had to know what the end was from the beginning I write unto you young man because you have believed in the beginning that your word shall abide in you and you shall overcome the wicked one can I say this to you the goodness of God y'all know that song the goodness of God the goodness of God brother Wesley is the forn knowledge of God the goodness of God is the forn knowledge of God now in the cor of this time he can can I can I show this to you in the calling of this time the going out on this I was born of a very humble parent a very humble home brother Matt I read this in your office D about shouted all over the place I have no education at all when I made that remark a while ago about education I wasn't trying to take crutches from ignorance but what I'm trying to say is that it doesn't take education to know God it takes a submissive heart to know God and I was raised poor I was raised in irreligious family but from the very time I was born something happened not of my goodness not of my parents goodness but by the for knowledge of God see he brought it I don't know why I don't know why he brought it he says I guess to show that he can choose what he wishes to whether it come out of the Vatican City or taken out of the rubbish sheep he can make it what he wants to regardless of where it come from oh Grace Tabernacle put your shouting shoes on some of y'all didn't come out of religious families some of you didn't come out of good backgrounds but God who is rich in Mercy through the election by adoption through predestination he claimed your soul by a seed and he chose you you know why he chose you Destiny to show he can take somebody and make something out of him he chose us brother Xavier it don't matter what the world says about us if God choses he can take something from the Vatican or he can take something from the rubbish Heap and when God gets done with it he's going to have a living breathing walking manifested Overcomer did y'all hear me Overcomer I'm preaching to you now you're overcoming it's not based on where you started you might have started in the ash Heap you might have started in the Vatican you might have started in the Baptist but it don't change the fact that when God gets done with you you're going to be an overcomer you're going to be an overcomer well somebody change your confession I am an overcomer I feel good I know it's time to quit but I feel good I know it's time to quit but I'm feeling pretty good I'm an overcomer y'all just forgive me for a second if you come from where I was if you knew the background I had and know where I'm standing and where God brought me from you would shout right with me you would Rejoice right with me but you know why I'm shouting with you is cuz I know where God brought some of you from I know the rubbish Heap I know the ash Heap but when God got done with you through the message of the hour you are an overcomer you're an overcomer let our musicians come tonight Overcomers Overcomers Overcomers greater is he that is in [Applause] you call you right out of the alus don't brother woo brother and make an overcomer well I feel good tonight come get you out of the middle of nowhere brother Xavier and reveal himself to you cleanse You by his blood come on mat a few years ago didn't look like an overcomer but he's a pastor today I'm talking about the blood yes sir whether it come out of the Vatican City or out of the rubbish Heap he can use you as an overcomer now now either you believe it or not brother BR said like this he said look at John 3:16 God so the world he gave his only begotten son that who soever believeth in him shall not perish but have everlasting life second Peter 3:9 the Lord is not slack concerning his promises some men count slackness but is longsuffering to us word not willing that any should perish but that all should come to repentance Jude 1:4 certain men crept in unawares who were before of old ordained to this condemnation listen at the prophet but just individuals out of the church who's predestinated to eternal life they'll [Music] come God's not willing that any should perish he doesn't want anyone to perish God but at the beginning of the beginning brother Matt at the beginning of the beginning at the beginning Brother David Paul of the beginning of the days The World God knew exactly who would be saved and who would not he didn't want people to be lost it's not as will they didn't should be lost but it's your will to save everybody but he knew from the beginning who would and who would not now in other words I said like this brother R said you fight your way to hell you fight your way to hell can I sit you like the prophet said he said can I can I buy five minutes it's not easy for a person to go to hell he said man fights his way to Hell the first lie you ever told you knew it was wrong the first cigarette you ever smoked you knew it was wrong the first evil you did you know it was wrong but in your conscience told you it was wrong but you continually run through that red light run over the barricades you want to do it anyhow show your some big eye but remember you fight your way to hell it's not easy to go to hell can I say this Jesus was God's barricade between a person in hell and the prophet said now I'm a man so he was a man he was the son of God begotten virgin born I'm a sinner saved by grace his grace saved me won't you stand your feet with us tonight rest yourself listen at this so through that he opened up a channel by [Music] election by for knowledge he opened a channel in my heart to give himself a place that he could work out to you people brother at the beginning of the beginning God decreed a blessing of Revelation 10:7 Malachi 4 Revelation 3:14 to a prophet in the end time by the name of William brandom and Mark brother Mark look at all that was between the beginning at the beginning to the time he received that but election brought it right to [Music] him probably God said it's your faith that does it not mine I couldn't do it can I can I leave you with one more powerful one brother BR said Jesus never come to Earth and died just in vain how many can say amen he never taken a chance to come to Earth Jesus wouldn't have did that God don't run his office business in heaven like that Loosely Jesus came to the Earth to die for a purpose and not to just see if it'd be somebody but God before the foundation of the world forsaw the whole thing do you believe it he foresaw it by for knowledge he forew it therefore he knew there was going to be a church called out without spotter wrinkle and there had to be preparations made to save that church so he sent Jesus Jesus and not just perhaps somebody might be saved but he knew who was going to be saved are y'all ready for this he would have a people called out and you are they you are they he would have a people that would believe in Divine Healing and you are they God knew it he knew there would be unbelievers there was then he knew there would be he forew it so therefore he could forsake would be that way and he fornew that there would be somebody who would believe it so he sent Jesus for those who would believe it and here they are today gathered here at one spot to accept what God forne would take place am God made a preparation for those who would believe and you're a part of that preparation God forne before the world every was formed that these days would be here that's the reason he could foretell it he forew it now watch and he made a preparation and you are the people that's come here to be prayed for for that preparation was made for God forew it he said that Rouses the emotions of our souls and you notice the Holy Spirit when he takes the word and sets it across the congregation watch the emotions of the audience you know what I do then I know that God's presence is in the building when you see the way the effect it's a moveing the people when you see just the [Music] word can I say this to you and don't get mad at me brother Wesley this bride is the answer to God's desire from the beginning of the beginning he desired to see a people brother Harvey that would all be gathered together and the only thing that would move them is the word and you are they I don't know about y'all but I wish I was out in the field right now I'd cut up you are they you are they you are they brother Benji you are they you are they that God saw that when this Revelation would be open there would be a people who would have a heart to receive it and they would manifest the glory of God through the election of God and they would walk in the confidence of God that they'll never fall that's not arrogance brother Mark that's confidence that's the confidence of the word of God you love him tonight let's bow our hearts together hallelujah hallelujah how many can raise your hand tonight and say I am they I am that person how many can go beyond your feelings tonight and you say brother Andrew I don't feel like it but you can say by Revelation I am they brother Ander I can't see how it's possible I am they [Music] brother Ander I can't see how that God through election and for knowledge could send these things to my life but I rais my hand tonight as Mary and say be it unto me I am they Heavenly Father all across this building tonight Lord this is a building full of they Lord your word said they overcome him they overcome the Devil by the blood of the the lamb and by the word of their testimony father I don't believe they is coming I believe they is standing before me tonight Lord I believe my eyes are looking tonight as I Minister this word I believe I'm looking at Sons and Daughters of God who have moved beyond the Battle of if they're a son or not if they're saved or not but Lord they've stepped over in the land and lord they're walking now under this Revelation the election of God by the adoption of God has positionally placed them in their position now Lord this is when the battle starts father when they move from wondering if they're a son when they move from wondering if they're going to make it or not father when they move from wondering if they're saved or not or if they got the holy ghost or not or when they receive that seal of God that's when the battle begins but Lord overcome means to keep life in you father I pray for every one of us in this building tonight dear God lord I pray that tonight we would we would let the revelation of the forn knowledge of God take preeminence in our lives and Lord we would walk with confidence and assurance that you chose us to express the power of overcome coming through Grant it tonight God in Jesus Christ's name we pray in Jesus name we pray in Jesus name we pray how many tonight can say I am an overcomer how many can say tonight by the word of the Lord I'm an overcomer Brother Kyle I don't see how but I am an overcomer now you say brother Ander I'm trying to overcome can I let you in on a little secret that'll help you you'll never overcome you said brother Ander really if you're trying to overcome you'll never overcome you know why because your hand is too unsteady brother B say like the kid trying to put the coat on he said they're trying and trying and fighting and fighting and trying and fighting he said but what happens is he said a more steady hand than they have comes and gets a hold of their hand and guides their hand into the coat and they put the coat on and they start walking in it he said how did they overcome by surrendering to a more steady hand than they had brother Wesley they quit trying and they surrendered to God's hand and God took their hand and brother said now you tried to quit smoking and you tried to quit drinking and you qu you tried to quit carousing and gambling he said now listen he said tonight you've quit he said not because you tried to quit he said because you accepted the one that did the quit for you you're in the world you'll have tribulation but be of good cheer I have overcome the world and greater is he that is in you my I've got a whole I've got a whole study on it but it's time to quit it's
