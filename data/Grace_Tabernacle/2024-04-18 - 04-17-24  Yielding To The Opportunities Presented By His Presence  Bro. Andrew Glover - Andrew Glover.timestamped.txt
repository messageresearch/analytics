[40:51] morning to you Amen in the the
[40:53] scriptures here in Matthew chapter
[40:55] 18 and verse number winie I love this
[40:59] verse because it's speaking amen of
[41:01] worshippers and here he says in the 20th
[41:04] verse Jesus speaking he said for where
[41:06] two or three are gathered together in my
[41:10] name he says there am I in the midst of
[41:14] them where two or three are gathered
[41:17] together in my name there am I in the
[41:19] midst of them now we're more than two or
[41:21] three here tonight and we're gathered in
[41:24] his name then I can say he is here in
[41:27] our midst in the Book of Matthew the
[41:29] 28th chapter just a few chapters over in
[41:32] the 20th verse here Jesus again speaking
[41:35] in Matthew
[41:36] 28:20 and he says these words teaching
[41:39] them to observe all things for
[41:42] whatsoever I have commanded you and lo I
[41:46] Am With You Always even un the end of
[41:49] the world brother B said or the
[41:52] consummation of the ages and we know
[41:54] tonight we're at the end of the Gentile
[41:56] dispensation of Ages but he is still
[41:59] here with his church amen we ask the
[42:02] Lord this evening to add the blessing to
[42:03] the reading of his word as you can be
[42:05] seated here this afternoon I want to
[42:08] amen for just a few moments tonight if I
[42:10] could Amen to continue speaking to you
[42:12] here on yielding Amen to Opportunities
[42:15] presented by the message of the hour
[42:18] amen and tonight I want to read this
[42:19] quote just to lay a foundation from the
[42:22] message Jehovah Gyra 1964 brother R said
[42:25] now remember that Christ is risen from
[42:28] the dead and is Among Us how many
[42:31] believes that Christ is risen from the
[42:33] dead and is Among Us he said and get
[42:36] that in your mind see that Christ is
[42:39] raised from the dead and is Among Us now
[42:42] we have seen all kinds of great moves
[42:44] and shouting and praising God that's all
[42:46] fine he said we've spoken tongues and
[42:48] prophesied and all we've seen all that
[42:50] that's fine that comes right along with
[42:52] it but remember amen the last thing is
[42:56] his divine presence the word itself amen
[43:00] so the last thing is not shouting or
[43:02] prophesying or speaking in tongues we
[43:04] believe in all those things amen but the
[43:06] last thing is the word itself he is the
[43:10] word amen the head the word it's coming
[43:13] to the body see that word in Hebrews 4
[43:15] the fourth chapter said the word of God
[43:17] is sharper more powerful than any
[43:19] two-edged sword and is a discerner amen
[43:22] of the thoughts and intents of the heart
[43:25] he said now take that scripture and run
[43:27] it right back from the beginning of the
[43:29] prophets amen run it right on down
[43:31] through Jesus Christ and see if that
[43:33] isn't the same thing the same thing that
[43:36] he is known as the Messiah I believe
[43:39] that he is known as the Messiah amen but
[43:42] I believe I'm speaking to Messiah s amen
[43:45] amen I believe that he was the Messiah
[43:48] and the pro of God said now it's not
[43:49] some man here is the Messiah amen but
[43:52] it's the holy spirit is the Messiah amen
[43:55] and Christ and the Holy Spirit is the
[43:57] same thing amen so here it is here now
[44:01] amen just working in the flesh getting
[44:03] the body ready amen for the rapturing
[44:06] grace so this last thing amen is the
[44:09] word itself coming to the body which
[44:12] will be the ushering in of the rapturing
[44:15] grace amen for the escaping of the
[44:17] Church of the Living God now when
[44:19] brother said I want you to remember the
[44:20] last thing amen I believe that he is
[44:23] referring Amen to several things that
[44:25] he's already spoke of in his message
[44:27] like your tape amen the the restoration
[44:30] of the Bride tree remember he said there
[44:32] were four death Messengers eat the tree
[44:34] down he said but there'll be four life
[44:37] Messengers that will restore the tree
[44:38] back and he said the Locust the
[44:40] cankerworm the palmerworm the
[44:42] caterpillar he said those were the death
[44:44] Messengers he said but those life
[44:46] Messengers would be Wesley and Pentecost
[44:49] and sanctification amen but listen amen
[44:52] I don't want to just stop at the third
[44:53] stage amen or neither do I want to stop
[44:56] at the third line
[44:57] amen but the prophet of God said
[44:59] justification made a way for
[45:02] sanctification and sanctification made a
[45:04] way for the baptism of the Holy Ghost
[45:07] amen and the baptism of the Holy Ghost
[45:09] has made a way amen for the Holy Ghost
[45:12] itself to come right down Amen in
[45:15] Perfection back to the word again Amen
[45:18] to manifest itself amen so the whole
[45:21] reason why that we're preaching the
[45:22] message amen is so that the word might
[45:25] come into the church and manifest itself
[45:28] the way it promised to be manifested in
[45:31] the age we're living in now in 1 John
[45:33] 1:7 we read it on Sunday amen but the
[45:35] Bible said if we walk in the light amen
[45:38] as he is in the light then we have
[45:40] Fellowship one with another and the
[45:42] blood of Jesus Christ his son amen
[45:45] cleanseth us from all sin that word walk
[45:48] again means to to make one's way it
[45:51] means to progress it means to make due
[45:53] use of opportunities again in Romans
[45:55] 13:11 Paul said knowing the time amen
[45:58] that now it is High Time Amen to awaken
[46:01] out of our sleep for now is our
[46:03] Salvation near amen than when we believe
[46:06] the night is far spent the day is at
[46:08] hand let us therefore cast off the works
[46:11] of darkness amen and let us put on the
[46:14] armor of light again in Ephesians 5:116
[46:17] Paul said Redeeming the time amen
[46:19] because the days are evil now amen can
[46:22] we break that down again Redeeming the
[46:24] time amen Redeeming the time means to
[46:27] buy up every and each opportunity it
[46:30] means you don't let one opportunity pass
[46:32] you by amen you remember on Sunday that
[46:34] these are not Services amen these are
[46:37] opportunities in the presence of
[46:39] almighty God Amen that word time is the
[46:42] Supreme moment amen it's the golden
[46:45] opportunity in other words Paul is
[46:47] saying redeem amen or yield to our
[46:50] golden opportunity in the presence of
[46:53] God himself I want to say it like this
[46:55] y'all remember in the Bible amen that
[46:57] there was the there was the holies of
[46:59] holies remember amen and Aaron had a rod
[47:02] amen and Aaron's Rod got left in the
[47:04] Shak kind of Glory or in the holies of
[47:07] holies and the Propet of God said now
[47:09] when that old dead Rod was brought out
[47:10] in there amen and laid in the presence
[47:13] of God himself what happened amen it
[47:16] budded and it blossomed and it yielded
[47:18] fruit amen when that Dead stick he said
[47:21] amen off of an almond tree was cut off
[47:23] and died he said but when it got in the
[47:26] presence of God
[47:27] it begin to Bud it begin to Blossom and
[47:30] it begin to bloom he said and when a man
[47:32] was cut off from God he died spiritually
[47:35] amen but once brought in the place of
[47:37] God Amen before the presence of God Amen
[47:40] he comes to life and yields life and let
[47:43] me say this I don't know where you're at
[47:45] in your journey amen but you ought to be
[47:47] able to Rejoice tonight amen that you're
[47:50] not in the presence of a dead
[47:52] denomination amen trying to produce Life
[47:54] by dead works but you have come back
[47:56] under the headship amen of the word of
[47:59] Jesus Christ amen and you are a Believer
[48:01] who is bring and you're brooding and
[48:04] you're bringing forth the fruit of the
[48:05] promise amen of God's word and you all
[48:08] know that God has laws right amen the
[48:11] prophet of God said God has laws and one
[48:13] law amen that I love amen is found in
[48:15] the book of Romans the 6th chapter and
[48:17] the 12th verse it is the law amen of
[48:20] presenting and yielding it is the law of
[48:23] presenting and yielding in Romans 612
[48:26] the Bible said let not sin therefore
[48:28] Amen reain in your mortal body that you
[48:30] should obey it in the lust thereof in
[48:33] verse 13 He said neither yield ye your
[48:35] members amen as instruments of
[48:37] unrighteousness Unto sin amen but yield
[48:41] yourselves unto God Amen how many says
[48:43] that's what I've come to do amen is to
[48:45] yield myself unto God Amen as those that
[48:48] are alive from the dead and your members
[48:51] as instruments of righteousness unto God
[48:54] let me just take a moment here Amen in
[48:56] break this verse down amen that word
[48:59] members is a limb or a member of the
[49:01] human body that word yield it means to
[49:04] present it means to provide Amen to a
[49:07] place a person or thing at one's
[49:09] disposal it is to present a person for
[49:12] another Amen to see in question to
[49:14] present or show to bring to to bring
[49:17] near it means to bring into one's
[49:19] fellowship or intimacy that word
[49:21] instruments is a weapon it is a tool or
[49:24] an Implement for preparing a thing and
[49:26] amen it is arms that are used in Warfare
[49:29] now look what Paul goes on to say amen
[49:31] for sin shall not have dominion over you
[49:35] amen for you are not under the law but
[49:37] you're under grace What then shall we
[49:39] sin because we're not under the law but
[49:42] under grace he said God forbid amen know
[49:45] ye not that to whom ye yield yourselves
[49:47] servants to obey amen his servants he
[49:50] are to whom you obey whether of sin unto
[49:53] death amen or obedience unto
[49:55] righteousness but God be thanked how
[49:58] many wants to thank God Amen that you
[50:00] were the Servants of sin but you have
[50:03] obeyed from the heart amen the form of
[50:06] Doctrine amen which was delivered unto
[50:08] you you all know that Malachi 4 says
[50:11] amen that God would turn our hearts back
[50:14] Amen to the faith of the fathers you
[50:16] realize Paul prophesied amen that the
[50:18] veil would remain upon the heart but
[50:21] there shall be a day which shall be
[50:22] known unto the Lord amen and at that day
[50:25] the heart shall turn to God God and when
[50:27] the heart is turned to God Amen the veil
[50:30] will come off of the heart and the
[50:32] believer will see the Mighty God Amen
[50:35] unveiled in plain view before him listen
[50:37] church amen we're not a bunch of
[50:39] Catholics here tonight amen trying to go
[50:41] through some man to get to God but God
[50:44] has sent a prophet in this generation
[50:46] and he has returned the church amen to
[50:48] Bible Doctrine amen and we're believe in
[50:51] that Doctrine amen not from a membership
[50:54] not from a handshake amen but from her
[50:56] heart we believe in the Oneness of God
[50:58] from our heart we believe in water
[51:00] baptism from our heart we believe in the
[51:02] power of God Amen we're not believing
[51:04] these things from just some church
[51:06] membership oh no we're believing these
[51:09] things from our
[51:10] heart look at this word obeyed it is to
[51:13] hearken to it is of one who on the knock
[51:16] at the door amen comes to listen to who
[51:19] it is so actually if somebody knocks on
[51:22] the door amen and you get up amen you're
[51:25] obeying the knock
[51:27] come on church when somebody knocks on
[51:29] the door and you respond to the knock to
[51:32] go over and see who is at the door amen
[51:35] you are obeying the knock at the door
[51:37] you know Revelation 3:20 said behold I
[51:40] stand at the door and knock If any man
[51:43] will hear my voice and will open the
[51:45] door I will come into him and will suck
[51:48] with him and he with me can I pick up
[51:50] something from the voice of the sign he
[51:52] said his voice will speak one day and a
[51:55] sign will come amen and what will it do
[51:58] the lotsy and sign must be the same as
[52:01] it was then can I take a minute and say
[52:04] this the message of the hour amen does
[52:06] not change the come on Church it does
[52:09] not change the word to fit the church
[52:12] but the message of the hour changes the
[52:14] church amen to fit the word amen the
[52:17] church is not God's pattern amen but the
[52:20] word is God's pattern amen and the
[52:22] church will have to conform Amen to the
[52:24] word because the word will will not
[52:26] conform to the church and I say thank
[52:29] God in the last days there has been a
[52:31] voice of vindication that has come among
[52:33] this generation there's been a knock at
[52:35] the door and it was not the bringing of
[52:37] a Creed it was not the restoring of a
[52:40] man's idea it was the restoration of the
[52:43] divine presence of God himself coming
[52:46] back in the church to manifest himself
[52:48] according to the word of God the layout
[52:51] of see and sign must be the same as it
[52:53] was then see there will be a voice speak
[52:55] to us in the last day remember Le out a
[52:58] see a sign Jesus is the same yesterday
[53:01] today and forever and when he was put
[53:03] out of the church in the lay out of s
[53:05] age we find out he is put out again Amen
[53:09] on the inside brother said it's the most
[53:12] ridiculous it's the most prophetic it's
[53:14] the most pitiful scripture in the entire
[53:17] Bible amen is Jesus Christ on the
[53:20] outside of his own church he said but
[53:22] look the voice says if aren't you
[53:25] thankful for a prophet If any man will
[53:27] cooperate if anybody will let me come in
[53:31] amen I'll come and sck with him and they
[53:33] with me amen I'll come in and I'll be in
[53:37] them he's standing Brother David Paul on
[53:40] the rank of the outside of the church
[53:42] age but he's standing there saying if
[53:45] any man will open the door and just
[53:47] cooperate with me just a little bit amen
[53:49] I will come in and I will sck with them
[53:52] I'll make myself known to them if I can
[53:54] just get in oh God if I can just get in
[53:57] like I did on the emus road if I can
[54:00] just get in amen I'll make myself known
[54:03] to them amen Christ said I will suck or
[54:06] I will reveal myself to them I will
[54:08] reveal that I am the same yesterday
[54:11] today and forever and the son of man
[54:13] will be revealed in that day when all
[54:15] the church hanity and everything else
[54:18] becomes Sodom like that I'll be on the
[54:20] outside I'll be knocking amen trying to
[54:24] get in what Grace Tabernacle amen take
[54:27] off your sad shoes and put on your
[54:29] shouting shoes tonight amen Jesus Christ
[54:32] is not on the outside of the church amen
[54:35] trying to get in trying to reveal trying
[54:37] to Fellowship amen but there is a knock
[54:40] that has come on the door but there was
[54:42] a seed on the inside of the heart and
[54:44] that heart received the doctrine of God
[54:47] with a voice of Thanksgiving with a
[54:49] praise of hallelujah hallelujah amen I'm
[54:52] not a crazy man I believe it's another
[54:55] of mayus road walk I believe there's
[54:57] some young people that you let him come
[54:59] in I believe there's some Elders here
[55:01] that you let him come in I believe
[55:03] there's some preachers here that you let
[55:05] him come in I say thank God he has
[55:08] stepped into the midst of the church in
[55:10] the power of his resurrection and he's
[55:13] changed things and he's saved lives and
[55:15] he's restored homes he's filled Souls
[55:18] he's redeemed people I'm talking about
[55:21] Jesus Christ who is the same yesterday
[55:24] today and forever
[55:27] I'm talking about there's been a knock
[55:28] on the door and someone has responded
[55:31] can I say this amen if someone knocks on
[55:34] the door they're presenting you
[55:36] something but when you open the door you
[55:39] are yielding to what's being presented I
[55:42] can I say the devil has presented this
[55:44] generation with all kinds of things and
[55:46] they have yielded to it brother B said
[55:49] like this he said now the flesh says
[55:51] there's no need you pretty little thing
[55:53] you're the prettiest little thing in
[55:54] school see now don't you pay any
[55:56] attention that Holy Roller mother of
[55:58] yours or that fanatic father SE you're
[56:00] the best looking girl in school you're
[56:03] the prettiest boy you're the best
[56:05] looking boy you're the best built you're
[56:07] the most popular there is in the city
[56:09] you see and you brother B said and you
[56:11] yield your members to that and where do
[56:14] you come out at amen the little end of
[56:17] the horn Every Time come on Amen you
[56:21] yield your lives Amen to the voices of
[56:23] Hollywood and you come out at the little
[56:26] end of the horn every time but Paul said
[56:29] amen My Flesh always wants to yield to
[56:32] that see amen and your flesh does too
[56:35] but the law of the spirit of God in the

[1:07:37] God thy spirit is good lead me into the
[1:07:42] land of the uprightness in Hebrews 10:7
[1:07:46] then said I lo I come in the volume of
[1:07:48] the book it is written of me to do thy
[1:07:51] will oh God above when he said sacrifice
[1:07:54] Hebrews 108
[1:07:56] sacrifice an offering and burn offerings
[1:07:58] and offering for sin now wouldest not
[1:08:00] neither had this pleasure therein which
[1:08:04] are offered by the
[1:08:06] law what did Paul say in Romans 6 we are
[1:08:09] not under the law but we are under grace
[1:08:13] watch verse n then said he lo I come to
[1:08:16] do my will and to do what I think's best
[1:08:18] and to do the way I
[1:08:20] feel no lo I come to do thy will oh God
[1:08:24] he taketh away the first that he may
[1:08:27] establish the second brother picks this
[1:08:29] up in the Hebrew series and reads the
[1:08:31] ninth verse and says as long as you're a
[1:08:34] presbyterian or a Pentecostal or a
[1:08:36] Baptist or a Methodist he can never do
[1:08:39] nothing with you he has to take that all
[1:08:42] the way first see so he can establish
[1:08:44] the second amen long as you say well I'm
[1:08:47] a Methodist I nothing against the
[1:08:49] Methodist or the Baptist or the
[1:08:50] Pentecostal but brother that don't spell
[1:08:53] it see you've got to go on to to
[1:08:55] Perfection amen and that is into Christ
[1:08:59] come on church we didn't just come to
[1:09:01] justification we're not just coming to
[1:09:03] sanctification we're not even just
[1:09:05] coming to the baptism of the Holy Ghost
[1:09:07] but we are coming to the last thing
[1:09:10] where we are rest returned to the
[1:09:12] presence of God and we are yielding our
[1:09:14] hearts to that presence and we're
[1:09:16] bringing forth what is concealed in the
[1:09:18] book in flesh he said by that which we
[1:09:21] are Sanctified through the offering of
[1:09:23] the body of Jesus Christ once and for
[1:09:24] all can we read our Bibles a little bit
[1:09:27] amen Hebrews 10:11 and every priest
[1:09:29] standed daily ministering and offering
[1:09:31] of times the same sacrifices which can
[1:09:34] never take away sins but this man after
[1:09:38] he had offered one sacrifice for sins
[1:09:40] forever he sat down on the right hand of
[1:09:43] God from hence forth expecting till his
[1:09:47] enemies be made his foot stol for by one
[1:09:50] offering he hath perfected forever them
[1:09:52] that are Sanctified whereof the Holy
[1:09:55] Ghost also is a witness to us for after
[1:09:58] that he said before this is the Covenant
[1:10:01] that I will make with him after those
[1:10:03] days sayth the Lord I will put my laws
[1:10:06] into their hearts and in their minds
[1:10:08] will I write them amen can I say it in
[1:10:11] verse 17 and their sins and iniquities
[1:10:14] will I remember no more oh Church of the
[1:10:18] Living God this message is the
[1:10:20] dismissing of your human mind that
[1:10:22] remembers all your faults remembers all
[1:10:25] all your failures remembers all your
[1:10:27] mistakes the message of the hour is the
[1:10:30] removing of the human mind and it is the
[1:10:32] imparting of the mind of Jesus Christ
[1:10:35] hey and in that mind he don't remember
[1:10:37] your sins and in that mind he don't
[1:10:40] remember your iniquities oh I wish I was
[1:10:42] out in the field right now I would cut
[1:10:43] up amen under this message I can say
[1:10:46] these words you'd never done it in the
[1:10:49] first place under this message I can
[1:10:51] preach to you you are the sinless amen
[1:10:54] spotless pride of Jesus Christ and you
[1:10:57] know how I can say that is because I was
[1:10:59] under the sin I was a servant under sin
[1:11:02] but God who was rich in Mercy they been
[1:11:05] sent a doctrine of the return of the
[1:11:08] word of God and I obeyed it in my heart
[1:11:11] and I turned my
[1:11:13] heart oh God I love how the prodag God
[1:11:16] says it he said if there was if there
[1:11:18] was never another case besides this lady
[1:11:20] that would be a perfect evidence of the
[1:11:23] Divine will of our Lord Jesus Christ to
[1:11:26] every person on the earth see he never
[1:11:28] he's talking about a woman who was
[1:11:30] ridden with cancer he never just picked
[1:11:32] out certain ones and said whosoever will
[1:11:34] let him come no he said whosoever will
[1:11:37] let him come see it's just according to
[1:11:39] your faith to
[1:11:41] believe he says I want to continue to
[1:11:44] speak about our Lord and his ministry
[1:11:46] today now there's many people in the
[1:11:47] Bible that teaches the Bible as a
[1:11:50] historical book which it is but it's
[1:11:52] more than a history it's a prophetic
[1:11:55] book book also that for Tails see it

[1:24:34] ourselves for his coming Lord Jesus we
[1:24:37] thank thee that brought again the Lord

[1:24:47] hearts as for a closer walk with him

[1:24:55] comes blessing our hearts and
[1:24:57] ministering to us the things that we
[1:24:59] have need of in this life's journey can
[1:25:02] I say this God has always been here in
[1:25:05] some form he is come on in the form of
[1:25:08] the prophets in the form of the pyramids
[1:25:11] in the form of Ls in the form of Angels
[1:25:13] in the form of the Y amen God has always
[1:25:16] been here in some form amen but today
[1:25:18] he's here in the form of a prophetic
[1:25:21] message which is the last thing which is
[1:25:24] the divine presence of God himself can I
[1:25:27] say this it's the presence of the Lord
[1:25:30] that gives us Faith it's the presence of
[1:25:32] the Lord amen that gives us knowledge
[1:25:34] it's the presence of the Lord that gives
[1:25:36] us courage to face another day it's the
[1:25:39] presence of the Lord amen that refreshes
[1:25:41] us it's the presence of the Lord that
[1:25:43] saves us it's the presence of the Lord
[1:25:46] That Forgives us of our sins and imp
[1:25:48] parts are Revelation in our souls and
[1:25:50] our sins are forgiven and our iniquities
[1:25:53] are remembered no more the holy spirit
[1:25:56] moves out on the building and speaks to
[1:25:57] whomever he will speak see that's
[1:25:59] Sovereign and then that brings the
[1:26:01] knowledge of God's Sovereign because
[1:26:03] it's a promise of God Amen and also
[1:26:06] brings his presence down Among Us he
[1:26:08] said we should see it and rejoice we
[1:26:11] should see his presence and rejoice we
[1:26:15] shouldn't look at his presence and
[1:26:16] question we should see his presence and
[1:26:21] rejoice now how many's heard the the the
[1:26:24] the the term ministered this is the
[1:26:26] appearing of
[1:26:28] Christ honestly let me see your hands
[1:26:30] you you've seen you've heard the term
[1:26:33] this is the appearing of Christ well
[1:26:34] there's a few that I just want to share
[1:26:36] this here in second Timothy 1:9 there is
[1:26:38] a difference between the coming of
[1:26:40] Christ and the appearing of Christ in 2
[1:26:43] Timothy 1:9 the Bible says who has saved
[1:26:45] us and called us with a holy calling not
[1:26:48] according to our works but according to
[1:26:50] his own purpose and Grace which was
[1:26:53] given in given us in Christ Jesus before
[1:26:57] the world began but is now made manifest
[1:27:00] amen by the appearing of Our Savior
[1:27:03] Jesus Christ who hath abolished death
[1:27:05] and has brought life and immortality to
[1:27:08] light through the gospel in second
[1:27:10] Timothy 4:8 Paul says again henceforth
[1:27:12] there is laid up for me a crown of
[1:27:14] righteousness which the Lord the
[1:27:16] righteous judge shall give me at that
[1:27:18] day and not to me only but unto all them
[1:27:21] that love his appearing can I give you
[1:27:24] another one in Titus 2:13 looking for
[1:27:27] that blessed hope and the Glorious
[1:27:29] appearing of the great God and our
[1:27:31] Savior Jesus Christ who gave himself for
[1:27:34] us that he might redeem us from all
[1:27:37] iniquity and purify unto himself a
[1:27:39] peculiar people amen zealous of Good
[1:27:42] Works look at this word appearing it
[1:27:44] means in the New Testament it is the
[1:27:47] Advent of Christ not only that which has
[1:27:49] already taken place and by which his
[1:27:52] presence and Power here in the saving
[1:27:55] light he has shed upon Mankind and can I
[1:27:59] say this it takes a prophet Amen to
[1:28:01] rightly divide the word of Truth and to
[1:28:04] separate the coming of Christ from the
[1:28:06] appearing of Christ don't you ever
[1:28:08] forget we are looking for the coming of
[1:28:11] Christ but we are living in the
[1:28:13] appearing of
[1:28:14] Christ is that clear enough we're
[1:28:17] looking for the coming living in his
[1:28:19] appearing he said there's a great big
[1:28:21] difference in the sign of Jesus
[1:28:23] appearing and then Jesus coming see the
[1:28:25] appearing of the Lord and the coming of
[1:28:28] the Lord see now the appearing of the
[1:28:30] Lord is now when he is appearing in his
[1:28:33] people his spirit is working among them
[1:28:36] amen proving that it's him with them are
[1:28:38] you ready for this getting them ready
[1:28:40] for the Rapture for the coming of the
[1:28:43] Lord to catch away his bride the
[1:28:46] appearing and the coming I'm going
[1:28:48] somewhere because we've all said in
[1:28:50] meetings and heard these words he's here
[1:28:54] how many's heard that he's here watch a
[1:28:57] prophet now the appearing amen the
[1:29:00] coming will soon be he's appearing in
[1:29:02] the midst of us amen doing the works he
[1:29:04] once did in his church now you're a part
[1:29:06] of that church and by Grace you believe
[1:29:09] I am a member of that church now can I
[1:29:11] say this watch a prophetic announcement
[1:29:14] Amen brother B says but my Ministry is a
[1:29:16] different Ministry from a pastor or a
[1:29:18] teacher see I'm not if I say something
[1:29:21] wrong brother forgive me I don't mean it
[1:29:23] but this is my Ministry see is to
[1:29:26] declare him amen that he's here we've
[1:29:30] heard that preached we shout about that
[1:29:32] but let's tonight relieve that Doctrine
[1:29:35] from the heart and let it release an
[1:29:37] authority in our praise come on church
[1:29:40] he I tell you if that Revelation settles
[1:29:42] in the depths of your soul the next time
[1:29:44] brother Matt says he's here that'll put
[1:29:46] such a punch behind your heart you'll
[1:29:49] say Amen brother I believe he's here
[1:29:52] because his word said he would be I
[1:29:54] believe he's here because sin is leaving
[1:29:56] my life Miracles are taking place in my
[1:29:59] home things are changing Hey listen what
[1:30:01] a prophet of God said he said what Jesus
[1:30:04] was what his presence is now what Jesus
[1:30:08] was what his presence is now he is
[1:30:10] supposed to return in the last days we
[1:30:13] know that through human flesh and
[1:30:15] declare himself the same way we all know
[1:30:18] that are we aware of it say Amen if it
[1:30:22] is now for your I say this to you in his
[1:30:25] name he is

[1:30:42] what she was thinking see God has sent
[1:30:44] his spirit amen to endue us with a

[1:47:20] people man they get saved and they get
[1:47:22] the whole Holy Ghost and they get in

[1:47:50] tonight these are not services
[1:47:53] there
[1:47:54] opportunities in his
[1:47:57] presence now if this was a Pentecostal
[1:47:59] Church it'd be a service cuz his
[1:48:02] presence is outside the building this
[1:48:04] was a Baptist Church it'd be a service
[1:48:06] his presence is outside the building
[1:48:08] they put Creeds and dogmas and doctrines
[1:48:10] of man and bondage and and all kinds of
[1:48:14] vomit but this
[1:48:16] ain't this is a message
[1:48:19] Church where the Holy Ghost has the
[1:48:21] rideway
[1:48:23] the spirit of God can move Hearts can be
[1:48:27] touched his presence can be
[1:48:30] felt I sitting today just just taking a
[1:48:34] few minutes this evening and meditating
[1:48:35] over some things and I remember brother
[1:48:37] Mark up in Virginia one night at brother
[1:48:39] Mike walls in a youth camp we outside my
[1:48:42] my wife probably remember this was
[1:48:43] outside in Old brush Harbor and it's
[1:48:45] hotter I mean it was hot in there I mean
[1:48:48] hot it's a hot I was preaching and got
[1:48:51] ready to pass out five minutes into it
[1:48:53] and all of a sudden brother Benji there
[1:48:54] was a storm just come just come blowing
[1:48:56] right in there it's kind of kind of
[1:48:58] funny we thought about storms
[1:49:00] today there was a storm just come
[1:49:02] blowing right in there when that storm
[1:49:04] come in there it started lightning I
[1:49:05] mean thundering and well we got probably
[1:49:08] 200 kids sitting outside under a under a
[1:49:09] tent or under a canopy and I'm just
[1:49:12] preaching when all of a sudden there was
[1:49:13] a a bang of thunder and a crash of
[1:49:15] lightning and the power just went out I
[1:49:17] mean just brother Mark just like that
[1:49:19] just like somebody flipped a switch the
[1:49:20] power went out and when it did when it
[1:49:23] did the church literally brother Joe
[1:49:25] just turned into an uproar of Praise I
[1:49:27] mean it was just like like like like you
[1:49:30] would almost set it up to happen like
[1:49:32] that but I knew we hadn't and brother
[1:49:35] Carter I was preaching with a microphone
[1:49:36] like this and I was preaching I I
[1:49:38] thought well the power's off so there's
[1:49:41] no need to hold this no more and when I
[1:49:43] laid it down brother John I heard that
[1:49:45] little that and I said well the mic
[1:49:47] still working and I picked it up and I
[1:49:50] said these words I said and God is still
[1:49:52] gone
[1:49:53] I said his word is still true and his
[1:49:56] power is still here and I just kept
[1:49:59] right on the preaching like that and
[1:50:01] brother there was a wind of the Holy
[1:50:02] Ghost blew right through that meeting I
[1:50:04] mean people were shouting screaming they
[1:50:07] were running to the altar well I left
[1:50:09] there at the end of the service the
[1:50:10] lights come back home and I left there
[1:50:12] and I went for two or three years
[1:50:13] wondering how in the world why did that
[1:50:15] happen like that and I went back a
[1:50:16] couple years ago to preach that meeting
[1:50:18] and a brother took me up to the to the
[1:50:20] to the cafeteria at the camp and he said
[1:50:22] brother andw I've been needing to thank
[1:50:23] you for something I said what's that he
[1:50:26] said brother Andrew he said you remember
[1:50:28] that first year we was out here and the
[1:50:29] lights went out and all that and I said
[1:50:31] yeah he said well you realize my
[1:50:32] daughter was sitting in that
[1:50:34] meeting he said and she was running from
[1:50:36] God he said and while she was sitting
[1:50:39] there she said these words she said God
[1:50:41] if you're
[1:50:42] God she said then prove yourself and she
[1:50:45] said if you're not she said then let
[1:50:47] this man shut up so we can go
[1:50:50] on he said when she said those words
[1:50:52] words the Lights Went Out the power went
[1:50:54] out and he said her next words was this
[1:50:56] just tell me these were her words she
[1:50:58] said see God you're not God the power is
[1:51:01] out the microphone's off he can't even
[1:51:03] preach he said when you laid that
[1:51:05] microphone down and there was still
