[39:30] There is no one else like
[39:36] you. Amen. You love the Lord this
[39:38] morning. Amen. Won't you just give the
[39:40] Lord a hand clap of praise and say it's
[39:44] certainly a privilege to be in the house
[39:47] of the Lord this morning. And hey, won't
[39:49] you just reach around and go shake
[39:51] somebody's hand and welcome in the house
[39:53] of the Lord. And I just sure privileged
[39:56] to be able to come this morning and
[39:58] fellowship around the word of God. And
[40:01] Amen. Sure good to see Kaitton back and
[40:04] walking around doing well. So God bless
[40:06] you, sis. Amen. Just don't want to put
[40:09] you on the spot, but sure good to see
[40:10] you this morning. Amen. Do you love the
[40:13] Lord? Amen. She just went through a
[40:15] surgery. Been praying for her and just
[40:17] believe God just to to heal her body and
[40:20] Amen. And certainly he is that kind of a
[40:23] God. This morning, how many can say
[40:24] God's done something for you lately?
[40:26] Amen. I said, how many can say God's
[40:28] done something for you lately? If you
[40:31] don't think he has, just look around and
[40:33] at your children and grandchildren and
[40:35] have a desire on their heart to do
[40:37] something for the Lord. That that's God
[40:38] doing that. Amen. I don't believe that
[40:40] the devil's ever put a desire on a man's
[40:42] heart to serve God. If there's a desire
[40:44] in our heart to serve the Lord, it's
[40:46] certainly come from the Lord. And so, we
[40:48] we love the Lord this morning.
[40:50] Uh certainly glad to be able to be a
[40:54] part of the move of God. Amen. Amen.
[40:56] Let's just bow our heads together and I
[40:59] just want to remember sister or little
[41:02] Hannah is sick this morning. Just ask
[41:05] the Lord to touch her body and my little
[41:07] buddy and just just pray for her. And if
[41:10] anybody else has a need on their heart,
[41:11] just lift your hand to the Lord. I know
[41:13] God is mindful of what we have need of
[41:15] this morning. Gracious heavenly father,
[41:18] Lord, we certainly thank you, Lord, for
[41:20] another opportunity to come and to
[41:23] fellowship around the word of God. Lord,
[41:26] how we love you, Lord. We are such a
[41:28] privileged people, Lord, to be able to
[41:30] come and and gather in this place. And
[41:33] Lord, that we have the ability, the ears
[41:36] to hear and the eyes to see. And Lord,
[41:39] we are so thankful that we've seen your
[41:41] word in this hour. And Lord, that you've
[41:43] called us to this great move of God.
[41:45] Lord, we've been called out by you. And
[41:47] Lord, we've heard that call. Lord, here
[41:49] we are standing as a body of believers.
[41:51] And Lord, awaiting instruction this
[41:54] morning. And Lord, may we just be able
[41:56] to fulfill what you'd have for us, Lord.
[41:59] And God, the very desire of your heart,
[42:01] it may be fulfilled in every one of us.
[42:03] And Lord, we'll just be careful to give
[42:05] you the glory for all that you do, Lord.
[42:07] We pray you'd touch those that are sick,
[42:09] heal the sick and body, Lord, and meet
[42:11] every need here this morning. We pray in
[42:14] the name of Jesus Christ. Amen. Amen.
[42:17] God bless you this morning. We just want
[42:19] to invite you to the Bible to the book
[42:20] of Psalms. And we'll read out of the
[42:24] It's got a little bit of a ring,
[42:25] brother. I don't know if you can help
[42:26] that, but um we'll read out of the book
[42:29] of Psalms in the first chapter and in
[42:31] the first verse. And give you just a
[42:34] moment to get to there.
[42:36] And Amen.
[42:39] Psalms 1 and1
[42:43] and Amen. I know we have several of the
[42:46] young kids that are going to the camp
[42:49] this week and so looking forward to what
[42:51] God does there. I always keep those
[42:53] meetings in my prayer and when you take
[42:56] time always spend time praying for those
[42:58] meetings and uh that God would do
[43:00] something for our our youth and whether
[43:03] it be a young people meeting or the uh
[43:06] or the tent meeting. We're we're going
[43:07] to be out on um at the end of the month
[43:10] and be speaking for brother Shawn at
[43:12] their tent meeting this year and brother
[43:15] Andrew and I will both be there
[43:16] speaking. So I know some are also going
[43:19] to the meeting. So just be praying about
[43:21] those upcoming services and we always
[43:24] just want to be available to do what God
[43:26] puts on our heart to do. Amen. So amen.
[43:29] You love the Lord this morning. Amen.
[43:31] Let's read out of the book of Psalms,
[43:32] the first chapter, the first verse. The
[43:34] Bible says, "Blessed is the man that
[43:36] walketh not in the counsel of the
[43:38] ungodly, nor standeth in the way of
[43:40] sinners, nor siteth in the seat of the
[43:42] scornful, but his delight is in the law
[43:44] of the Lord, and in his law doth he
[43:47] meditate day and night. And he shall be
[43:49] like a tree planted by the rivers of
[43:51] water that bringeth forth his fruit in
[43:54] his season. His leaf also shall not
[43:56] wither, and whatsoever he doeth shall
[43:59] prosper. The ungodly are not so, but are
[44:02] like the chaff, which the wind driveth
[44:04] away. Therefore, the ungodly shall not
[44:06] stand in the judgment, nor sinners in
[44:08] the congregation of the righteous. For
[44:10] the Lord knoweth the way of the
[44:12] righteous, but the way of the ungodly
[44:16] shall perish. And I would like to speak
[44:18] this morning out of this scripture, the
[44:21] value of a true blessing. And we'll just
[44:23] ask you to take your seats this morning.
[44:25] The value of a true blessing. Here in
[44:28] this Psalm of David, as David is
[44:30] writing, he starts out by saying,
[44:32] "Blessed is the man." I thought, "M, we
[44:34] could take a sermon on that. Blessed is
[44:37] the man that walketh not in the counsel
[44:39] of the ungodly." This word blessing that
[44:41] David uses or blessed uh is actually a
[44:45] Hebrew word cher. And this word means
[44:47] happiness. I thought, you know, that's
[44:49] something that all of us, if we would
[44:51] ask everyone this morning, uh I believe
[44:53] that we all seek after that. We we seek
[44:55] to be a happy people. We look for
[44:58] happiness for our family, you know,
[44:59] husbands and wives. And uh you want
[45:01] there to be happiness in your marriage
[45:03] and happiness in your home. And and and
[45:06] we work hard to to have a life and have
[45:08] happiness in our in our in our life. And
[45:11] uh uh to I don't I don't think there's
[45:13] any one of us that wouldn't say that we
[45:15] want to lead a a life that is a happy
[45:17] life, a life that is that that is
[45:19] satisfied. We're satisfied with our our
[45:21] work and our effort and the reward that
[45:23] we gain from it. So uh I believe that
[45:25] any any person just the nature of
[45:27] humanity is to live in happiness is to
[45:30] is to satisfy the the life that we have
[45:32] and the time that God has given us. And
[45:34] uh and we realize that the Bible here is
[45:36] speaking that a that a man that leads a
[45:39] happy life and a man is speaking of a
[45:41] man that has a life of satisfaction. For
[45:44] David said, "Blessed is the man." In
[45:46] other words, happy is the man. Satisfied
[45:48] is the man that walketh not in the
[45:50] counsel of the ungodly. But notice that
[45:52] David actually shows us where this man's
[45:55] happiness comes from. So this is
[45:56] something that we're seeking after. But
[45:58] David gives us the answer and says this
[46:00] is where it comes from. The happiness of
[46:02] the man actually comes from the word of
[46:04] God. For David said, for his delight is
[46:07] in the word. Isn't that good? His
[46:08] delight is in the law of the Lord and
[46:11] his and upon that law or on the word of
[46:13] God. He he meditates upon it day and
[46:16] night. His happiness comes from that. So
[46:18] we realize that that not only is that
[46:20] where his happiness comes from and now
[46:22] that's what makes a man to be able to
[46:23] live a happy life is because he's
[46:25] meditating on the word of God day and
[46:27] night and because he loves the word and
[46:29] because he he's find satisfaction in the
[46:31] word. And any man that does this, David
[46:33] said that man is a happy man. He lives a
[46:36] happy life. But notice that he didn't
[46:37] just leave it there that it that it was
[46:39] happy but also uh that that man actually
[46:42] received a blessing from God because he
[46:45] was obedient to the word of God. I love
[46:47] this cuz David, he begins to show that
[46:49] this is a happy man. He lives a happy
[46:51] life. But then he says because he obeys
[46:54] the word of God. He said he would be
[46:56] like a tree that's planted by the rivers
[46:58] of water that bringeth forth fruit in
[47:00] his season. His leaf shall not wither
[47:03] and whatever he does shall prosper. So
[47:05] here, a man that delights in the word of
[47:07] God, a man that meditates on the word,
[47:09] he will prosper. In other words, he
[47:11] won't fail. He will grow. He'll become
[47:13] stronger. He'll be greater. And and
[47:15] David says, "And one day that's the only
[47:17] kind of a man that'll be left standing."
[47:20] He said, "For the un ungodly are not so,
[47:22] but just like the chaff, they wind will
[47:24] come and it will drive them away. But
[47:26] the man that is a godly man, he'll be
[47:28] left standing. The man that is a godly
[47:30] man, he'll be he'll he'll be a tree
[47:32] that's planted by the waters. He'll have
[47:34] roots that are deep enough to be able to
[47:35] withstand the storm because he is a
[47:38] godly man." He says, "So, it isn't like
[47:40] that with the ungodly man. He'll go into
[47:42] judgment. The sinners won't stand in the
[47:43] congregation of the righteous. He said,
[47:45] "But the Lord knoweth the way of the
[47:47] righteous, but the way of the ungodly is
[47:50] going to perish." Isn't that something
[47:51] that here that God gives a promise to
[47:54] those that delight in his word? How many
[47:56] delight in the word of God? Then this
[47:58] promise is unto you this morning. You
[48:00] you you've just you just uh tapped into
[48:02] this promise of God because we delight
[48:04] in the word. That God's promise to those
[48:06] that delight in the word is that one,
[48:08] they shall not perish, but they shall be
[48:11] everlasting. Isn't that wonderful? You
[48:13] can't perish. It doesn't matter what
[48:14] come, what wind would come, what storm
[48:16] would come, what what trial would come
[48:18] in your life because our delight is in
[48:20] the word of God. You shall not perish,
[48:22] but you shall be left standing. That
[48:25] just makes me feel good this morning to
[48:26] think that God has given me a place to
[48:28] plant my feet and a place for my roots
[48:30] to grow that no matter what would come
[48:32] in my life. Don't you realize there's
[48:34] great storms that come upon every one of
[48:36] our lives there? There there ain't no
[48:37] man that's any better than another.
[48:39] We're all tempted with every like
[48:40] manner. The same thing that the sinner
[48:42] uh has trials with and faces with and
[48:45] tempted with is the same thing the sons
[48:47] and daughters of God are tempted with.
[48:48] But I thank God that we have a place to
[48:50] put our roots. Brother Mark, that when a
[48:53] storm would come that we are not moved,
[48:55] but we stand like a tree that's planted
[48:57] by the rivers of water. Our roots run
[49:00] deep in the word of God. That every
[49:01] storm that would come, it wouldn't that
[49:03] it wouldn't even wither the leaves that
[49:05] are growing off the tree that's planted
[49:07] by the rivers of water. But my leaves
[49:09] shall sprout forth. They shall bloom in
[49:11] due season. They shall put forth. They
[49:13] shall bring forth the will of God in my
[49:15] life. Said he shall be like a tree. Now
[49:18] see, I don't think that anyone would say
[49:20] this morning that I don't want the
[49:22] blessings of God. Everybody here, how
[49:24] many would say that this morning? I want
[49:25] to receive the blessings of God. We Why?
[49:28] Because we are a people that desire to
[49:29] be blessed. We want we want God to be
[49:32] pleased with us. Every one of us today,
[49:34] we we want God to be pleased with what
[49:36] we do and the things that we do. And we
[49:38] want to receive every blessing that God
[49:41] has. How many can say that this morning
[49:43] that I want to receive every blessing
[49:44] that God has for me. If God has
[49:46] something that he wants to give, I want
[49:48] to receive it. I I'm just one of them
[49:50] kind of people. If God's up there
[49:51] handing out stuff, I'm going to be the
[49:52] first one in line. But I don't know what
[49:54] God has given out today, but God, he's
[49:56] never been a kind of giver that don't
[49:58] give out something good. So if God said,
[49:59] "I've got something to give." I want to
[50:01] be the one in line with my hand out
[50:03] saying, "Lord, I'm here to receive it
[50:04] this morning. I want to receive every
[50:06] good thing that God has to give unto me.
[50:09] Every good blessing that God could give
[50:10] to a man. I want to be able to receive
[50:12] the blessings from God. You know what
[50:14] happens today is people make it too hard
[50:16] to receive from God. It becomes a great
[50:18] complicated thing to receive something
[50:20] from God. It's all this work up and all
[50:22] all these different efforts that it
[50:23] takes. But brother Bam said he said God
[50:25] has not made it complicated. He said
[50:27] people they try to make it think it's
[50:29] that way that it's complicated.
[50:31] Therefore, they miss the real blessing
[50:33] of the word by trying to make it some
[50:35] hard thing. He said the believer may
[50:37] make it complicated, but God is just
[50:39] making it simple. How many wants to know
[50:40] the simplicity of receiving the
[50:42] blessings of God? In other words, he
[50:44] said every blessing that God ever gives
[50:46] a man is found right in the word of God.
[50:48] And God gives you a way, a simple way to
[50:50] be able to receive it. I I know people
[50:52] make all kinds of things you got to go
[50:54] through in order. He said, "But every
[50:55] blessing, it lays right in the word."
[50:57] And God gives us a way to access it. You
[50:59] read this. We we can read in the book of
[51:01] numbers uh you remember whenever
[51:03] whenever God was giving out the Nazerite
[51:05] vow to Moses and he was showing uh of
[51:08] how the remember what the vow they would
[51:10] have to go through and not cut their not
[51:12] cut their hair and they couldn't eat
[51:13] certain thing couldn't drink wine or
[51:15] strong drink or feed upon the grapes and
[51:18] and and and couldn't uh be around a dead
[51:21] body or nothing you know that would that
[51:23] would make them unclean but while God
[51:25] was giving this vow out or giving the
[51:27] instruction to the Nazarite vow I
[51:29] thought here he's laying in all this
[51:30] law. But the blessing of the children of
[51:33] Israel was on God's mind. So here
[51:35] whenever he would give all this law and
[51:37] all the law to the Nazarite, right at
[51:39] the end of it, all of a sudden God
[51:41] begins to instruct Moses as he's talking
[51:43] about the vow and such. He said, but all
[51:45] of a sudden he says he says, "I want you
[51:47] to go to the priest and bless the priest
[51:49] and and tell the priest to go bless my
[51:52] people." I thought my isn't that the way
[51:54] God does here. He gave instruction to
[51:56] the priesthood to bring a blessing unto
[51:58] the people of God. I think there's some
[52:00] some some preachers today that got the
[52:01] wrong instruction when they when they
[52:03] can't bring the blessings of God to the
[52:05] people of God. But that's the
[52:06] instruction that God gave us to bring
[52:08] the blessing to the people of God
[52:10] because it's on God's mind is to bless
[52:12] his children. It's the desire of God to
[52:14] bless his children. The Bible says the
[52:16] Lord spake unto Moses. He said, "Go to
[52:18] Aaron and say unto his sons, on this
[52:21] wise shall you bless the children of
[52:23] Israel, and you shall say unto them, the
[52:26] Lord bless you and keep you.
[52:29] The Lord bless you and keep you. The
[52:31] Lord make his face shine upon thee and
[52:33] be gracious unto thee. I thought, what a
[52:35] message that God gave unto Aaron to give
[52:37] unto the priest. He said, this is the
[52:39] message I'm putting in your mouth, and I
[52:41] want you to speak it unto my children.
[52:43] Say, the Lord bless you and keep you.
[52:45] The Lord make his face shine upon thee
[52:48] and be gracious unto thee. May the Lord
[52:50] lift up his countenance upon thee and
[52:52] may he give you peace and they shall put
[52:54] my name upon the children of Israel and
[52:57] I will bless them. I thought my what a
[52:59] privilege that God gave unto them. He
[53:01] said that you go to the children of
[53:03] Israel and put my name upon my children
[53:06] that I may bless them. I thought what an
[53:08] instruction that God gave to the men of
[53:10] God today to to go to my people and put
[53:13] my name upon them and bring them to the
[53:16] place that I can give a blessing unto
[53:18] them. I thought, my God has given us an
[53:20] order this morning, an instruction this
[53:22] morning, not to bring the children of
[53:24] God to a place of destruction and not to
[53:26] bring them to a place that God would
[53:28] curse them. But he's given us an
[53:30] instruction out of the mouthpiece of God
[53:32] by the word of God to bring upon his
[53:35] children the name of Jesus Christ that
[53:37] the God of heaven may pour his blessing
[53:40] out upon his church.
[53:42] Bring us to a place that God can bless
[53:44] us. I I don't know about you, but that's
[53:46] the call I want to walk in this morning.
[53:48] God, may we bring your children to a
[53:50] place that you can pour your blessing
[53:52] out upon them. I don't want to see
[53:53] people fail. We don't want to see people
[53:55] hurt. We don't want to see people
[53:57] struggle. I want to see people on fire
[53:59] with the presence of God. I want to see
[54:01] them walking in the blessing of God. And
[54:03] the blessing be upon their life. It's
[54:06] God's desire to bless you. Let me tell
[54:09] you this this morning. I honestly
[54:10] believe that God's desire to bless you
[54:12] is greater than your desire to receive
[54:14] it. It's on the mind of God. It's always
[54:17] been on God's mind is a desire to bring
[54:19] a blessing to his children. Amen. But
[54:22] you realize this that blessing has a
[54:24] value. And most of the time when we look
[54:26] at the value of a blessing, we look at
[54:28] what it is to us, the recipient, and
[54:30] what what value the receiver gets. But
[54:32] you realize that also the blessing has a
[54:35] value to the giver. Have you ever gave
[54:38] somebody something? How many knows that
[54:39] feeling? I had a a dear friend of mine
[54:41] here in church. I got a real wealthy uh
[54:43] uh uh church member that bought me a
[54:46] helicopter the other day. I thought that
[54:47] was mighty fine of him. And you know, I
[54:49] made a statement. I wish I had a
[54:51] helicopter. On the next service, he
[54:52] brought me one. He said, "Brother, you
[54:54] you you I can handle that." I said,
[54:56] "Well, I kind of was thinking of one I
[54:58] could get in, not step on, but
[55:00] nonetheless, I don't want to knock down
[55:01] his gift, but you know, it makes you
[55:03] feel good to give somebody something. I
[55:06] it's a reward to the giver when you give
[55:09] somebody something and the the joy that
[55:11] it brings to their life and you know
[55:13] that that's why I always like Christmas
[55:14] when you can when you can go around and
[55:16] give people gifts and things. I never
[55:19] wasn't about getting something. It's
[55:20] about giving something and and bringing
[55:22] joy to somebody's life. It brings a
[55:24] reward to the giver. It brings a
[55:26] satisfaction and a peace and a happiness
[55:28] to you. Isn't that true? How many
[55:29] testify of it? brings such a a happiness
[55:32] to you and to be able to give and be
[55:34] able uh to do uh to do things in that
[55:36] way. And I and you find out in the
[55:38] scripture the reason that is is it
[55:40] actually pleases God to give to you. And
[55:42] not only does he desire to give you a
[55:44] blessing, but it pleases God to bless
[55:46] you. Matter of fact, that's why the
[55:47] Bible said John 3:16, for God so loved
[55:50] the world that he gave his only begotten
[55:52] son that whosoever believeth him would
[55:55] not perish but have everlasting life.
[55:57] For God sent not his son into the world
[55:59] to condemn the world but that the world
[56:02] through him might be saved. Here God is
[56:05] giving the gift of eternal life. How
[56:07] many know knows the scripture? He's
[56:09] giving the gift of salvation. This is a
[56:11] gift that God has given to the to the
[56:13] world. And notice what the Bible said.
[56:15] Isaiah 53. The Bible says that it
[56:18] pleased God to give that gift. He said
[56:20] it pleased the Lord to bruise him. It
[56:23] pleased him to put upon him grief that
[56:25] thou shalt make his soul an offering for
[56:27] sin. It pleased God to make his soul an
[56:30] offering for sin. That he shall see his
[56:32] seed and shall prolong his days. And
[56:34] that the pleasure of the Lord would
[56:36] prosper in his hand. That he shall see
[56:38] the travail of his soul and he shall be
[56:41] satisfied. Isn't that a thought this
[56:43] morning to hear that that it pleased God
[56:46] to see the travail of his soul? The
[56:48] Bible said it satisfied God to see the
[56:51] travail of his soul. It was pleasing to
[56:53] him to give his life for you. It was
[56:55] pleasing to him to give something that
[56:57] you would be able to receive a blessing.
[56:59] But Abraham said it pleased God, that
[57:01] great sculptor, to smite him and to do
[57:03] it this way. We in Isaiah, he said we we
[57:05] all did esteem him. We turned our face
[57:07] from him. There was no beauty that we
[57:10] should desire him. Everybody was talking
[57:12] about him and persecuting him and make
[57:14] fun of him. But it wasn't just then.
[57:16] It's the same way today. They talk about
[57:17] him and persecute him and make fun of
[57:19] him. make fun of you for going to church
[57:21] and make fun of you for for dedicating
[57:23] your life to the Lord uh God that nobody
[57:25] that that they can't even see. But he
[57:27] said it's the same way it is today. We
[57:29] esteemed him smitten and afflicted of
[57:32] God. He said, "But what did he do it
[57:33] for? He was wounded for our
[57:35] transgressions and he was bruised for
[57:37] our iniquity." It was the gift that God
[57:40] gave unto us. He said, "But he he was
[57:42] bruised for our iniquity, but it was
[57:44] God's desire." Think about it. It was
[57:46] God's desire to give that to you. I
[57:49] don't know about you, but it makes me
[57:50] feel good this morning to think that it
[57:52] was God's desire to give you healing. It
[57:55] was God's desire to give you salvation.
[57:57] It's God's desire to give you
[57:59] deliverance. It's not God's desire that
[58:01] you be bound. It's God's desire that
[58:03] you'd be free. It's God's desire that
[58:06] you'd be lifted up. It's God's desire
[58:08] that you'd be encouraged. It's God's
[58:10] desire that you would grow. It's God's
[58:12] desire that you would prosper in this
[58:13] life. It's the desire of God that you
[58:16] would be a blessed people.
[58:19] In the book of Luke, we find Mary as the
[58:22] angel comes to her. The Bible says the
[58:23] angel when he came, "Hail Mary, thou art
[58:25] highly favored and the Lord is with thee
[58:28] and blessed art thou among women." We've
[58:30] read this scripture many times. But
[58:32] notice this word blessed, it's a little
[58:34] different meaning than the word that
[58:35] David used. This word blessed, it comes
[58:38] from a Hebrew word yuloio, which means
[58:41] to bless or to speak well of someone or
[58:43] something. In the New Testament, it's
[58:45] used in various context including the
[58:47] act of blessing God or blessing others
[58:50] and or blessing individuals. It conveys
[58:52] a sense of invoking a divine favor. So
[58:56] here when the angel comes to speak to
[58:58] Mary and he says blessed art thou among
[59:01] women, it's actually it's actually
[59:03] conveying a sense of God invoking his
[59:06] divine favor over her life. That's why
[59:09] he said, "Thou art highly favored. Thou
[59:12] art blessed art thou among women. I
[59:14] thought my isn't that something for the
[59:15] angel to say you are blessed. In other
[59:18] words, he was speaking of her being
[59:20] favored of God among her peers. So he
[59:24] said, "Blessed art thou." In other
[59:25] words, you are favored of God among
[59:28] other women. You're favored. I thought,
[59:29] "My, what a word for the angel to say
[59:31] over your life. Blessed art thou. You're
[59:33] favored of God among men. You're favored
[59:36] of God among your peers. You're favored
[59:38] of God among others." You re you realize
[59:40] you say, "Brother Mark, what what made
[59:41] her blessed?" It wasn't it was because
[59:44] it wasn't because of something that she
[59:46] did. It was something that she was
[59:47] willing to do. Here, God being an
[59:49] eternal God and God, oh, let me tell you
[59:51] friends, God knows all about you. He
[59:53] knows everything you would ever do,
[59:54] every decision you would ever make,
[59:56] every word you would ever speak before
[59:58] you was ever born on this earth. But
[1:00:00] what made her blessed is what she was
[1:00:02] willing to receive because she was
[1:00:04] willing to receive the seed of the word
[1:00:06] of God in her. So that God being an
[1:00:09] eternal God, he knew I'm that's just
[1:00:12] good stuff. He knew that she was willing
[1:00:14] to receive seed. And because he knew
[1:00:16] that she was willing to receive seed
[1:00:18] when the angel came to her, he said,
[1:00:20] "You are highly favored and you're
[1:00:22] blessed among women." Don't you realize
[1:00:24] that when the angel spoke to her, I
[1:00:25] think that's so powerful that the angel
[1:00:27] called her blessed before the seed was
[1:00:29] ever planted. Before the seed ever came
[1:00:32] into her life, the angel stood before
[1:00:34] her and said, "You're highly favored and
[1:00:36] you're blessed among women." Because
[1:00:37] there's something about her that God
[1:00:39] knew that she was willing to receive the
[1:00:42] seed of the word of God. Oh friends,
[1:00:44] before she ever surrendered her life, he
[1:00:46] called her blessed. Before she ever gave
[1:00:48] her her life to to the angel, he said,
[1:00:50] "You're highly favored." You know what
[1:00:52] that tells me? It tells me that God sees
[1:00:55] things in you that have not yet
[1:00:57] manifested. And God can look at your
[1:00:59] life and he says, "You are highly
[1:01:01] favored and you're blessed among men."
[1:01:03] God, what have I done to be called
[1:01:05] blessed? What have I done to be called
[1:01:07] worthy? What have I done to be highly
[1:01:09] favored of God? That you're willing to
[1:01:11] receive the word of God, to receive the
[1:01:14] seed of the word. But friends, don't you
[1:01:16] see it? Before the seed was ever
[1:01:18] planted, I thought, my, it wasn't long.
[1:01:21] It wasn't long before you could see the
[1:01:23] evidence of that seed growing in Mary.
[1:01:26] It took a few months before you could
[1:01:28] see the evidence of that seed growing.
[1:01:30] But before she ever surrendered, she was
[1:01:33] already called blessed. That makes me
[1:01:35] want to shout all over this building.
[1:01:37] Hallelujah. Before she ever surrendered,
[1:01:40] she was already called blessed. But that
[1:01:43] means before you ever receive the seed
[1:01:45] of the word in your heart, you're
[1:01:47] already highly favored and you are
[1:01:49] already called blessed. Before you ever
[1:01:51] show the signs of life, you're already
[1:01:54] called blessed. Before you're ever
[1:01:56] manifesting the life of the seed of God
[1:01:58] on the inside of your heart, you're
[1:02:00] already called the blessed of God.
[1:02:03] Say, "Why am I blessed?" Because you're
[1:02:05] willing to receive the seed of the word.
[1:02:08] I remember Jesus preaches a whole
[1:02:10] message on the blessed of God. I've
[1:02:12] actually took a a series on this a few
[1:02:14] years ago and how he went through
[1:02:16] Matthew the 5th chapter. Remember the
[1:02:17] sermon on the mount? Jesus said,
[1:02:19] "Blessed are the poor in spirit, for
[1:02:20] theirs is the kingdom of heaven." Now I
[1:02:22] know the church world takes that that
[1:02:24] word blessed and because blessed means
[1:02:26] happy in one place they say well happy
[1:02:28] is the poor in spirit for theirs is the
[1:02:30] kingdom of god but in this particular
[1:02:32] place when Jesus speaks this it's not
[1:02:33] the same word it's actually has a deeper
[1:02:36] meaning than happy it comes from the
[1:02:37] Greek word marios which means supremely
[1:02:40] blessed or or or or by extension
[1:02:43] fortunate or welloff and when this word
[1:02:45] blessed that Jesus is speaking remember
[1:02:47] here he's sitting upon the mountain he's
[1:02:48] speaking to the disciples blessed are
[1:02:50] the poor in spirit spirit for theirs is
[1:02:52] the kingdom of God. But when it's used
[1:02:54] properly, here show it's showing how
[1:02:56] that God extends his benefits to his
[1:02:59] sons and daughters. So in other words,
[1:03:02] it was not just a feeling. See, you
[1:03:03] could say happiness is a feeling. It's a
[1:03:05] it's an emotion. It's a joy. But this
[1:03:07] was far greater than a joy or an emotion
[1:03:10] or a feeling. So it wasn't just a
[1:03:11] feeling, but it was actually showing a
[1:03:14] position of the believer. So when he
[1:03:16] said blessed are the poor in spirit this
[1:03:19] word blessed mockario actually describes
[1:03:21] the position of a believer after
[1:03:24] receiving God's provision or God's
[1:03:26] favor. So whenever Jesus would say
[1:03:28] blessed are the poor in spirit he's
[1:03:29] actually saying he's actually pointing
[1:03:31] to the position that they have because
[1:03:34] they've received God's favor. So blessed
[1:03:36] are the poor in spirit. They are they
[1:03:37] are they they have received from God. So
[1:03:39] so we realize it's not if I do then I'm
[1:03:42] going to be blessed. That's where most
[1:03:43] people look. Blessed are the poor in
[1:03:44] spirit. So, I'll go act like I'm humble
[1:03:46] and then I'll be blessed because, you
[1:03:48] know, the the poor in spirit are going
[1:03:49] to be blessed and the and the meek are
[1:03:51] going to be blessed. So, I'll just go
[1:03:53] pretend I'm meek and and I'll try to put
[1:03:55] on some meekness and and if I can put on
[1:03:56] meekness, then God's going to bless me.
[1:03:58] But that ain't what it's saying at all.
[1:04:00] But the Bible says, "Blessed are the
[1:04:01] meek." In other words, they're already
[1:04:03] meek
[1:04:04] because they were the blessed of God
[1:04:07] because of who they are. It's speaking
[1:04:08] of their position in God. And because
[1:04:11] they are the blessed of God, then they
[1:04:13] are meek. because they are the blessed
[1:04:14] of God, they are the poor in spirit.
[1:04:16] Because they are the blessed of God,
[1:04:18] then they have the nature of God. It's
[1:04:20] because of who they are. Blessed are
[1:04:22] those that are poor in spirit. For
[1:04:24] theirs is the kingdom of God. You see,
[1:04:26] we realize that this word blessed, it
[1:04:28] means so much to God. It's because
[1:04:31] because you are blessed. Then you do
[1:04:33] those things because of who you are.
[1:04:35] It's speaking of your position. It meant
[1:04:36] so much. This is you realize that this
[1:04:38] word macario this or this word blessed
[1:04:40] it was the same name that God that that
[1:04:43] God was given by the apostle Paul in 1
[1:04:45] Timothy he said according to the
[1:04:47] glorious gospel of the blessed God.
[1:04:49] Hallelujah. In fir in 1 Timothy 6 he
[1:04:52] said until the appearing of our Lord
[1:04:53] Jesus Christ which in his times he shall
[1:04:56] show who is the blessed and only
[1:04:58] potentate the king of kings and the lord
[1:05:00] of lords. I thought my the same word
[1:05:03] that he would use to describe God the
[1:05:05] blessed God. speaking of his position
[1:05:08] over the believer. He's the king of
[1:05:09] kings. He's the lord of lords. He's the
[1:05:11] only potent. So he uses this word
[1:05:13] blessed to def to define who God was. He
[1:05:16] was using it to define the the very
[1:05:18] position of God. And then he take this
[1:05:20] same word. This is the word Jesus uses
[1:05:23] to talk about you. Blessed are the poor
[1:05:25] in spirit for theirs is the kingdom of
[1:05:27] God. He preached a whole sermon on it.
[1:05:29] Blessed are are the are the humble. that
[1:05:32] you realize that when Jesus, he's
[1:05:34] actually telling us the characteristics
[1:05:36] of those that are blessed. Blessed are
[1:05:37] the meek. Blessed are the humble.
[1:05:39] Blessed are the peacemakers. Blessed are
[1:05:41] the merciful. Blessed are are are those
[1:05:43] that that are pure in heart. They might
[1:05:45] be talked about. They'd be they'd be
[1:05:47] persecuted for for the sake of Christ.
[1:05:49] But these are the blessed of God. And
[1:05:52] they will display these characteristics
[1:05:54] because of who they are.
[1:05:57] Isn't that wonderful? Because of who you
[1:05:58] are. That's why that's why you are
[1:06:00] humble. That's why you are meek. That's
[1:06:01] why you that's why you can you can be
[1:06:05] what a Christian really is. You can
[1:06:06] manifest that because you are the
[1:06:08] blessed of God. You are blessed and
[1:06:10] highly favored. You see what did Mary do
[1:06:12] to deserve the blessing of God. Think
[1:06:14] about it. The angel think when the angel
[1:06:17] came, he never said that Mary received a
[1:06:20] blessing. He said that Mary was blessed.
[1:06:24] I want you to catch it because there's a
[1:06:26] difference. He said she was blessed.
[1:06:27] Mary, you are highly favored. When the
[1:06:30] angel came to her and said, "You're
[1:06:31] highly favored and the Lord is with you.
[1:06:33] Blessed art thou among women." See, it
[1:06:35] wasn't what she did. It was who she was.
[1:06:38] It was her relationship between her and
[1:06:40] God. Blessed art thou among women.
[1:06:42] You've been highly favored. In other
[1:06:43] words, you've been chosen by God to hear
[1:06:45] the message of the angel. See, it showed
[1:06:48] it showed it. Brother Mark, you said,
[1:06:50] "Well, how do you know that she really
[1:06:51] was what the angel said?" Well, let me
[1:06:53] tell you, it showed by how she responded
[1:06:56] to the word. Right? So when the angel
[1:06:58] spoke the word over her, notice what she
[1:07:00] said here. She was faced with something
[1:07:01] that most of us would find hard to
[1:07:03] believe. But nevertheless, she believed
[1:07:05] it anyway. And she said, "Be it unto me
[1:07:07] according to thy word." See, because she
[1:07:10] was willing to receive the word of God.
[1:07:12] And because she was saying, "So be it.
[1:07:14] Be it unto me." Because that it
[1:07:16] identified who she was. It identified
[1:07:18] that the angel didn't find the wrong
[1:07:20] girl on the road. He didn't meet the
[1:07:22] wrong girl in the field. He met the
[1:07:23] right one. And he said, "You're highly
[1:07:25] favored and you're blessed among women."
[1:07:27] And she said, "Be it unto me according
[1:07:29] to thy word." It may not seem possible.
[1:07:31] I don't see how that could manifest in
[1:07:33] my life. If you knew my past and you
[1:07:35] knew where I came from, I don't know how
[1:07:37] the word of God could ever come out of
[1:07:39] me. But you're blessed and highly
[1:07:40] favored. In the middle of your sin, in
[1:07:43] the middle of your failure, before you
[1:07:44] ever knew where to go, but you was
[1:07:46] already blessed of God. You were called
[1:07:48] of God before the foundation of the
[1:07:50] world. You were blessed and highly
[1:07:51] favored. Hallelujah. And she said, "Be
[1:07:53] it unto me." Watch her response to the
[1:07:55] word. identified who she were. But
[1:07:58] Abraham said, "That's what we have to do
[1:07:59] is to take him at his word. We don't try
[1:08:01] to figure it out how it's going to be.
[1:08:03] We just take him out at out his word."
[1:08:05] He said, "Notice as soon as she got his
[1:08:06] word and and heard his word that she was
[1:08:09] going to have a baby." She didn't wait
[1:08:11] until she tested positive. She didn't
[1:08:13] wait until she felt life. She started
[1:08:15] right out testifying what God's word
[1:08:18] said about her. He said, "God, won't you
[1:08:20] give us some more Marys down here
[1:08:23] that'll take God at his word and testify
[1:08:25] about it before anything happens just
[1:08:27] because God's word said so?" Now, I
[1:08:30] think that's what we ought to have
[1:08:31] today. I wonder if there's any more
[1:08:32] marriage here that could take the word
[1:08:34] of God and testify about it. When God
[1:08:36] said, "You're highly favored." Oh, God,
[1:08:38] if you looked at my life, my life's just
[1:08:40] a wreck. I ain't nothing in the sight of
[1:08:41] God. I ain't done none of what these
[1:08:43] other men have done or other women have
[1:08:45] done. How can I be blessed of God? But
[1:08:47] she didn't do that. She went out
[1:08:48] testifying about what the angel said
[1:08:50] about her. Be it unto me according to
[1:08:53] thy word. The Bible said not only did
[1:08:55] she accept the word of God over her
[1:08:57] life, but my Bible says she rejoiced in
[1:09:00] the word that was spoken over her. Even
[1:09:02] when she didn't feel life changing, even
[1:09:05] when she didn't feel it manifesting in
[1:09:07] her, even when she had no signs of life
[1:09:09] on her was the same signs that had
[1:09:11] always been, but something on the inside
[1:09:14] of her because she heard the word. The
[1:09:16] Bible says she rejoiced in the word that
[1:09:18] was spoken over her. Hallelujah. The
[1:09:22] Bible said Mary said, "My soul doth
[1:09:24] magnify the Lord. My spirit hath
[1:09:26] rejoiced in God my savior, for he hath
[1:09:28] regarded the low estate of his
[1:09:31] handmaiden." God saw me in my low
[1:09:33] estate. She went to testifying about
[1:09:36] what God done. Oh, God saw me in this
[1:09:38] old miserable condition. And I wonder
[1:09:40] how many this morning say, "God saw me
[1:09:42] in this miserable condition and he saw
[1:09:44] the low estate of his handmade, but he
[1:09:46] favored me and he called me and he sent
[1:09:49] an angel my way and he called me out of
[1:09:51] my condition.
[1:09:54] Henceforth, listen at her testimony. And
[1:09:57] henceforth, little old Mary, little
[1:09:59] nobody, this little weak girl,
[1:10:02] henceforth all generations shall call me
[1:10:06] blessed." Hallelujah. She hadn't showed
[1:10:08] no signs yet. That's just preaching
[1:10:11] stuff. She hadn't showed no signs yet,
[1:10:14] but she was already testifying about
[1:10:16] what the angel said about her. All
[1:10:19] generations. She wasn't heady and all
[1:10:21] high-minded about it. She just believed
[1:10:23] the angel. And she said, "So be it. All
[1:10:26] generations shall call me blessed." See,
[1:10:29] when she found out she was blessed, she
[1:10:33] began to rejoice just like we do this
[1:10:35] morning. When you hear that you are the
[1:10:37] blessed of God, it causes you to
[1:10:39] rejoice. You say, "Well, well, how did
[1:10:41] how did she know she was?" Because the
[1:10:44] angel said so.
[1:10:46] That's how she knew she was rejoicing in
[1:10:48] who God said she was. She wasn't
[1:10:50] rejoicing in what others said about her
[1:10:52] or what she thought about her. Even her
[1:10:55] own, our Bible tells us what she thought
[1:10:57] about herself. She said, "God saw me in
[1:10:58] my lowest state." She that's what she
[1:11:01] thought about herself in my low estate.
[1:11:03] I I'm a nobody. But she wasn't
[1:11:05] testifying about what she thought about
[1:11:06] herself. Amen. She was testifying about
[1:11:08] what the angel said about her. God
[1:11:10] regarded me in my lowest state. My is
[1:11:13] that something? In other words, can I
[1:11:14] say it like this this morning? Sometimes
[1:11:16] you have to look past your past.
[1:11:20] Sometimes you have to look beyond it.
[1:11:21] Look past your past and past your lowest
[1:11:23] state and look into the mirror of the
[1:11:26] word of God like Mary done and say, "Be
[1:11:28] it unto me according to thy word." Man,
[1:11:31] I failed God last week, but let me look
[1:11:33] in the mirror of the word. He says,
[1:11:34] "You're a son of God." And when a son of
[1:11:36] God finds himself in a wrong, he just
[1:11:37] corrects it and he makes it right and he
[1:11:39] quickly gets back up and he repents to
[1:11:41] God and he and God and he receives the
[1:11:43] favor of God. I'm going to find what God
[1:11:45] said about me and testify about what the
[1:11:47] word says. Look in the mirror of the
[1:11:49] word. Be it unto me according to thy
[1:11:50] word. I know what the devil says. Yeah.
[1:11:52] I I know what I know what he says. Well,
[1:11:54] that was Mary. That was the mother of
[1:11:55] Jesus. It's easy to preach that about
[1:11:57] Mary. After all, she was the mother of
[1:11:59] Jesus. But can I tell you what Jesus
[1:12:00] said? Well, anybody can call Mary
[1:12:02] blessed, right? Because the Bible said
[1:12:03] she was, the angels said she was, Jesus
[1:12:05] said she was, the people said, "So
[1:12:07] anybody can call Mary blessed." Well,
[1:12:08] you can always say that about her, but
[1:12:10] but what about me? You know what Jesus
[1:12:13] said here? A woman came whenever he was
[1:12:15] preaching and a woman came and
[1:12:17] interrupted his sermon and she began to
[1:12:19] cry out. She said, "Blessed is the womb
[1:12:21] that carried thee and the breast that
[1:12:23] nurse thee." You know what Jesus
[1:12:24] responded to her? He said, "I say
[1:12:26] rather, blessed are they that hear the
[1:12:28] word of God and keep it." Amen. So if
[1:12:31] Mary was that blessed of God that an
[1:12:33] angel of God would come to her and say
[1:12:35] she's blessed and highly favored. And
[1:12:36] then Jesus would say, "But more blessed
[1:12:38] are you that would hear the word." My
[1:12:40] goodness, more blessed are you that
[1:12:42] would hear the word of God and keep it.
[1:12:45] You're the blessed of God and you're
[1:12:46] highly favored of God. Oh my. If the
[1:12:48] angel would say you're highly favored
[1:12:50] and the Lord is with thee, then what's
[1:12:52] that say about you? If he says you're
[1:12:54] blessed among women, then what's that
[1:12:56] say about you? that because of who you
[1:12:58] are, you manifest the word that has been
[1:13:01] spoken about you. See, because of who
[1:13:03] she was, she didn't go around quoting,
[1:13:05] "A virgin shall conceive." That's not
[1:13:07] that was not Mary's testimony, but she
[1:13:10] lived. A virgin shall conceive. She
[1:13:13] manifested the word of God that was
[1:13:15] pertaining to her life. That's why we
[1:13:17] don't go around saying God's going to
[1:13:18] send a prophet in the last days, and he
[1:13:20] he's going to call a people out, and
[1:13:21] there there's going to be a bride.
[1:13:22] There's going to be a bride that's
[1:13:24] called out of a church. But because of
[1:13:25] who you are, you just manifest it and
[1:13:28] you rejoice in it just like Mary did.
[1:13:30] She manifested what the word said about
[1:13:32] her and she rejoiced in it. So that
[1:13:34] therefore as a body of believers this
[1:13:36] morning, we can stand up and we can
[1:13:37] manifest it and rejoice. I we don't have
[1:13:40] to say God's going to do and God's going
[1:13:42] to send and God's going to work and
[1:13:44] God's going to call, but I can say I am
[1:13:46] the elect of God. I am that elected
[1:13:49] lady. I'm the bride of Jesus Christ.
[1:13:51] I've been called out by God. I've heard
[1:13:53] the cry of the eagle. I've seen the true
[1:13:56] anointed one in the end time. I
[1:13:58] recognize my day and its message. And I
[1:14:00] am the blessed of almighty God. I am the
[1:14:03] blessed of God. Amen. The truly blessed.
[1:14:07] We recognize who we are. Therefore, we
[1:14:10] manifest it. We're the blessed of God.
[1:14:12] How many say that? I am the blessed of
[1:14:15] God. See, now there's a difference of
[1:14:17] being
[1:14:18] blessed and receiving blessings from
[1:14:21] God. I I don't want to leave nothing on
[1:14:23] the table. Deuteronomy 28th chapter
[1:14:26] here, God has given instruction to
[1:14:27] Israel. I love this because he lays all
[1:14:30] of these blessings down to them. He
[1:14:32] said, "If thou shalt hearken unto the
[1:14:33] voice of the Lord thy God, then blessed
[1:14:35] shalt thou am I running out of times? I
[1:14:37] don't "Then blessed shalt thou
[1:14:39] be blessed shalt thou be in the city,
[1:14:42] and blessed shalt thou be in the field.
[1:14:44] Amen. Blessed shall be the fruit of thy
[1:14:46] body and the fruit of thy ground and the
[1:14:48] fruit of thy cattle, the increase of thy
[1:14:51] kind and the flocks of thy sheep. Can
[1:14:53] you imagine sitting there as the
[1:14:55] children of Israel? Maybe they Moses had
[1:14:58] that wrote down and you taken and sit
[1:15:01] down with your family as a father and
[1:15:04] had the privilege as a father to read
[1:15:05] this over your family. What a privilege.
[1:15:08] You know, when you look around the
[1:15:09] world, there was so much starvation and
[1:15:11] things that they had they had came out
[1:15:13] of, so much troubles and trials. But
[1:15:14] here as a daddy, you could sit down or
[1:15:17] as a mama and sit down to your children
[1:15:19] and say, "But blessed shall you be in
[1:15:21] the city." Little children come up. You
[1:15:24] know, mama, you know, my friends, they
[1:15:25] they have this kind of wreck going on
[1:15:27] and this kind of trouble and they, you
[1:15:28] know, you could always point to all the
[1:15:30] negative things that's going on around
[1:15:31] us and around the world. And maybe they
[1:15:33] looked at everything seem to be falling
[1:15:34] apart and all these other nations, but
[1:15:36] here that that little mama would have
[1:15:38] this word to be able to read, but
[1:15:40] blessed shalt thou be in the city and
[1:15:43] blessed shall you be in the field. Hear
[1:15:45] what she's telling. It doesn't matter
[1:15:47] where you are, whether you're in the
[1:15:48] country, whether you're in the city,
[1:15:50] this blessing of God is going to follow
[1:15:51] you. Bless you'll be in the city.
[1:15:53] Blessed you'll be in the field. Blessed
[1:15:55] shall be the fruit of thy body. Blessed
[1:15:57] shall be the fruit of the ground. The
[1:15:59] crops that you plant, they're going to
[1:16:01] it'll be a blessed crop. When you raise
[1:16:03] cattle, your cattle are going to be
[1:16:04] blessed. When you raise sheep, your
[1:16:06] sheep will be blessed. The goats will be
[1:16:08] blessed. Everything that you raise is
[1:16:09] going to be blessed. Blessed shall be
[1:16:11] thy basket and thy store.
[1:16:14] Your your pantry will be a blessed
[1:16:16] pantry. I don't know about y'all, that
[1:16:17] just does something for me for God to
[1:16:19] speak to you in that way that that it'll
[1:16:22] be a bless bless you will be when you
[1:16:24] come in and bless you'll be whenever you
[1:16:26] go out. And the Lord shall cause your
[1:16:29] enemies that rise up against you to be
[1:16:31] smitten before thy face. They may come
[1:16:33] out against thee one way, but they're
[1:16:35] going to flee before thee seven ways
[1:16:37] because you're the blessed of God. The
[1:16:39] Lord shall command the blessing upon
[1:16:41] thee in thy storehouses, and in all that
[1:16:43] thou setest thy hand into. He shall
[1:16:46] bless thee in the land which the Lord
[1:16:48] has given thee. And the Lord shall
[1:16:50] establish establish you as a holy people
[1:16:52] unto himself as he has sworn unto thee.
[1:16:56] Isn't that powerful? God is going to
[1:16:58] give this blessing to you. Can you
[1:16:59] imagine telling that to your children?
[1:17:01] It's the blessing. It's what God It's
[1:17:02] God's gift that is given to you. Your
[1:17:04] your basket will be blessed. Your store
[1:17:06] will be blessed. your pantry will be
[1:17:08] blessed. When you come in, you're going
[1:17:10] to be blessed. When you go out, you're
[1:17:11] going to be blessed. I can't think of
[1:17:12] nothing I'd rather be able to say to my
[1:17:14] children that it don't matter where you
[1:17:16] go. You're going to be blessed. If you
[1:17:17] find yourself in a low place, but you
[1:17:19] got the blessing of God following after
[1:17:21] your life. If you find yourself lost out
[1:17:23] somewhere, but you got the blessing of
[1:17:24] God following after your life. It's good
[1:17:27] stuff. The blessing of God is falling
[1:17:30] after. It's what I want to share with my
[1:17:32] children. But notice what God said.
[1:17:35] If can I hang on that word a minute? If
[1:17:40] this is a blessing. This is God giving a
[1:17:43] blessing to his children. Pouring out a
[1:17:46] blessing to his children. If thou shalt
[1:17:49] keep the commandments of the Lord and
[1:17:52] walk in his ways.
[1:17:54] So here God had promised. Isn't that
[1:17:56] isn't that something here that God had
[1:17:58] promised this blessing to them? But if
[1:18:01] they will keep the commandments. Now you
[1:18:02] notice what happened to Israel. I'll use
[1:18:04] this as an illustration. What happened
[1:18:06] with Israel is they stopped following
[1:18:07] the word of God. And through generations
[1:18:10] and traditions of men that they had
[1:18:12] stopped to follow the word and they had
[1:18:13] went different different directions. And
[1:18:15] so here God sends the prophet Malachi,
[1:18:17] remember when you read Malachi and he
[1:18:18] starts to set them straight. How many
[1:18:20] knows that when Malachi is preaching in
[1:18:22] Malachi the third chapter and he's
[1:18:23] speaking to the children of Israel that
[1:18:25] Malachi is actually answering a question
[1:18:27] that the children of Israel had asked.
[1:18:29] How many knows what the question was?
[1:18:30] They had asked this question. What have
[1:18:33] I gained from serving God? You have to
[1:18:36] dig a little bit to find it, but it's
[1:18:37] there. What have I gained from serving
[1:18:39] God? I wonder how many times that every
[1:18:41] one of us had asked that same question.
[1:18:44] At some point in our life that what have
[1:18:45] I gained from serving God? This is the
[1:18:47] question that they had asked. And when
[1:18:48] the prophet Malachi comes, he begins to
[1:18:51] address this question because they had
[1:18:53] failed to to to follow the word because
[1:18:55] they didn't feel like they gained
[1:18:56] anything by serving God. And you know,
[1:18:58] after all, we we we work with our own
[1:19:00] hands. We've earned our own keep. we
[1:19:02] we've got a big enough army. We got
[1:19:03] enough people. We got big enough fields.
[1:19:05] What what have I gained from serving
[1:19:06] God? And so because they felt this way,
[1:19:09] they stopped following the word. They
[1:19:10] stopped giving offerings. They stopped
[1:19:11] giving tithing. They they they quit
[1:19:13] obeying the word. And so when Malachi
[1:19:15] comes, he comes to bring a correction.
[1:19:17] He said, "Even from the days of your
[1:19:19] fathers, you've gone away from my
[1:19:20] ordinance. You have not kept them. But
[1:19:22] return to me, and I will return unto
[1:19:24] you, sayeth the Lord." But you said,
[1:19:26] "Well, where shall we return? Will a man
[1:19:29] rob God?" He said, "But you have robbed
[1:19:31] me." You say, "Where have we robbed
[1:19:32] you?" He said, "In tithing and
[1:19:34] offering." He said, "Therefore, you are
[1:19:36] cursed with a curse, for you have robbed
[1:19:38] me, even this whole nation." Now, this
[1:19:40] shouldn't have came a surprise to Israel
[1:19:42] that that that they would receive a
[1:19:44] curse from God. Because in the same law
[1:19:47] that that mama would sit and read to her
[1:19:49] children over God blessing you for
[1:19:52] obeying the word at the end of that same
[1:19:54] chapter of Deuteronomy 28, notice that
[1:19:56] God actually said to them if they failed
[1:19:59] to obey the word, he said it would come
[1:20:02] to pass that as the Lord rejoiced over
[1:20:05] you to do good and to multiply you, so
[1:20:08] the Lord will now rejoice over you to
[1:20:10] destroy you and to bring you nothing,
[1:20:13] and you shall be plucked off from the
[1:20:14] land whether you go to possess him. Now,
[1:20:17] that's a I wonder how many would read
[1:20:18] that first part of Deuteronomy 28. And
[1:20:21] let's just leave out the last part cuz
[1:20:22] nobody wants to read about being plucked
[1:20:24] off and and the blessing of God being
[1:20:26] turned off and and being being cast out
[1:20:29] of the land that God gave them to to
[1:20:31] possess the Nobody wants to read about
[1:20:33] God giving them something and plucking
[1:20:35] them out of it. So, so, so they they may
[1:20:37] would stop and they forgot about that
[1:20:39] and they failed to keep the word of God.
[1:20:41] But here Malachi would come. He said,
[1:20:42] "But now you're cursed with a curse." I
[1:20:44] thought, my isn't it something? It's sad
[1:20:46] to think that a God that has a desire to
[1:20:49] bless his children is forced to bring a
[1:20:51] curse or bring a judgment upon them
[1:20:53] because they wouldn't keep his word.
[1:20:55] See, it was God's desire to bless. It
[1:20:57] wasn't God's desire to curse. It was
[1:20:59] God's desire to bless. But because they
[1:21:01] failed to keep the word of God, then
[1:21:03] then then a curse came upon their life
[1:21:06] because they failed to keep it. Now, now
[1:21:08] you realize this that that you know mo
[1:21:10] maybe maybe most uh uh don't know this
[1:21:12] this morning, but do you realize that
[1:21:13] blessings and cursings actually come
[1:21:15] from the same place? You know, the Bible
[1:21:18] tells us that and matter of fact in in
[1:21:20] judgment, it came from heaven just like
[1:21:22] a blessing came from heaven. Remember
[1:21:24] remember when when Noah uh was building
[1:21:26] the ark and the Bible said when it came
[1:21:28] time for the judgment of God to come
[1:21:30] upon the earth that the windows of
[1:21:33] heaven opened up and the rain came out
[1:21:36] of the windows of heaven for 40 days and
[1:21:39] 40 nights and it flooded the whole
[1:21:41] earth. So right out of the windows of
[1:21:43] heaven comes the judgment of God and it
[1:21:45] floods upon the earth. It was on it for
[1:21:47] 40 days and 40 nights. But let me tell
[1:21:49] you something about God. God ain't like
[1:21:51] men that would allow you that would
[1:21:53] leave you in the wrong so that you could
[1:21:55] keep doing bad. Glory to God. Because
[1:21:58] it's God's desire to bless you. It's
[1:22:01] God's desire for you to prosper. It's
[1:22:02] God's desire for you to do well so God
[1:22:05] won't leave you doing bad. I I know some
[1:22:07] of you boys play sports and stuff. You
[1:22:09] know, sometimes you go play a team that
[1:22:10] ain't real smart. Kobe, he he plays
[1:22:12] baseball. And you know, you get out
[1:22:14] there and some of them teams, they may
[1:22:15] not be coached very well. And when you
[1:22:17] go up there and you're standing on the
[1:22:18] on the on the plate and you're getting
[1:22:19] ready to to receive a pitch and you look
[1:22:21] out and the second baseman is so far off
[1:22:24] of second base, he's halfway over the
[1:22:26] first base, a little bit farther. And
[1:22:28] you look out and say, man, that guy's
[1:22:29] way out of position. And the shorts
[1:22:31] stop, he's way over here by third place,
[1:22:33] and he's tending up like this, kind of
[1:22:34] looking around. You're, man, these guys
[1:22:36] are way out of position. Well, I know
[1:22:37] what I'm going to do. I'm going to bop
[1:22:38] one right over the pitcher's head, right
[1:22:40] across second base where they ain't
[1:22:41] neither one of them can get to it
[1:22:42] because they're out of position. Now, if
[1:22:44] they had a good coach, their good coach
[1:22:46] would look at them and say, "Hey, y'all
[1:22:47] got to move over. What if he puts one
[1:22:49] down the middle? There ain't nobody can
[1:22:51] get through it." See, the coach is going
[1:22:52] to put them out, put them back in
[1:22:53] position where they can make a play. But
[1:22:55] because they're your opponent, you would
[1:22:57] never stand on the home or on home play
[1:23:00] and holler at the second baseman and
[1:23:02] say, "Hey, I'm about to hit one down the
[1:23:03] middle. You need to move over or you're
[1:23:05] you're way out of place. Your shorts
[1:23:07] stop. You're too far over. I'm about to
[1:23:09] hit it right there. You need to move
[1:23:10] over or you're not going to be able to
[1:23:11] make a play on the ball." See, you would
[1:23:13] never do that because he's your
[1:23:15] opponent. See, but when it comes to God
[1:23:17] and God's children, you're not God's
[1:23:20] opponent. Hello, somebody. I want you to
[1:23:22] hear that loud and clear. You're not
[1:23:24] God's opponent. God ain't competing with
[1:23:26] you. God is trying to give to you. God's
[1:23:29] trying to bless you. God's trying to
[1:23:31] grow you. God's trying to prosper you.
[1:23:34] He's trying to bring his word to build
[1:23:35] you and edify you and elevate you to a
[1:23:38] place that you can receive the blessing
[1:23:40] of God. God ain't competing with you.
[1:23:42] Come on. See, he's not your opponent.
[1:23:44] His desire is to bless you. So, notice
[1:23:46] what God does. He gives them the answer.
[1:23:49] He says, "So bring all the tithes into
[1:23:51] the storehouse that there may be meat in
[1:23:53] my house and prove me now, sayeth the
[1:23:56] Lord of hosts, that if I will not open
[1:23:58] the windows of heaven and pour you out a
[1:24:00] blessing that there shall not be room
[1:24:02] enough to receive it." I don't know
[1:24:04] about y'all, but that's the kind of
[1:24:05] blessing I want. If there's a window in
[1:24:08] heaven that's big enough to dump out
[1:24:10] water that would flood the whole earth,
[1:24:12] that's the window that I want my
[1:24:13] blessings coming out of. I want a
[1:24:15] blessing that that a window that's big
[1:24:17] enough to destroy the world to send that
[1:24:19] much water. I say, God, open that window
[1:24:21] up over my life and pour me out a
[1:24:24] blessing that I cannot contain.
[1:24:27] I'll open the windows of heaven. Glory
[1:24:29] to God. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. Amen.
[1:24:32] The windows of heaven opened up to you,
[1:24:35] Lord. poured out of that window upon me.
[1:24:38] You remember that day, Lord, when you
[1:24:39] rain water? You remember when you rain
[1:24:42] water out of out of heaven, out of that
[1:24:44] same window and you flooded the whole
[1:24:46] earth? Lord, open that window unto me.
[1:24:48] Lord, open that window up under my
[1:24:50] children. Lord, open that window up
[1:24:53] under your church this morning. Lord,
[1:24:54] open that window and pour us out a
[1:24:56] blessing that we cannot contain. Let it
[1:24:58] overflow. Let it flood over our life.
[1:25:04] He said, "I will rebuke the Glory to
[1:25:05] God."
[1:25:07] Hallelujah.
[1:25:09] I will rebuke the devourer for your
[1:25:10] sake. He shall not destroy the fruits of
[1:25:12] your ground. Remember, there was a curse
[1:25:14] upon them because they failed to to keep
[1:25:16] the word of God. And notice what Malachi
[1:25:18] the prophet is doing. He's restoring the
[1:25:20] word back to the children that God can
[1:25:22] take the curse back off their land. He
[1:25:24] said, "I will rebuke the devour for your
[1:25:26] sake and and he shall not destroy the
[1:25:29] fruits of your ground." Yes, sir.
[1:25:30] Hallelujah. I'm gonna call him off.
[1:25:32] Neither shall your vine cast your fruit
[1:25:34] before before season, sayaeth the Lord.
[1:25:37] And all the nations shall call you
[1:25:39] blessed, and you shall be a delightsome
[1:25:41] land. In other words, you'll be highly
[1:25:44] pleasing unto God. How many can say
[1:25:46] that's your testimony? Lord, let me be a
[1:25:48] delightsome land. Let let the let the
[1:25:50] world look upon me. That's a delightsome
[1:25:52] land. They they they have such the
[1:25:54] blessing of God upon their life. Let
[1:25:56] let's be a a delightsome land. But
[1:25:58] notice what he was doing. He's he was
[1:26:01] instructing them to to bring them to a
[1:26:03] place where that God could bless them.
[1:26:04] We still believe that this morning. We
[1:26:07] believe that the that that that the
[1:26:08] blessings of God comes according to the
[1:26:10] word of God. Now, we realize where this
[1:26:12] where this tithing came from. This
[1:26:14] wasn't just something that Malachi was
[1:26:15] talking about. This was the instruction
[1:26:16] that God had given to the church. And
[1:26:19] according all the way back in the book
[1:26:20] of Genesis, I think it was in the 14th
[1:26:23] chapter whenever Abraham went and fought
[1:26:25] in the slaughter of the kings. remember
[1:26:26] and he went back and got Lot to regain
[1:26:28] his possessions. Whenever he came back
[1:26:30] and Melkazedc met Abraham on the road,
[1:26:32] the Bible says he sat down and he made a
[1:26:34] feast with him and Abraham gave him
[1:26:36] tithing of all the spoils that he had
[1:26:38] gained. Now, may you ever notice what
[1:26:40] happened to Abraham after he first paid
[1:26:42] tithes? I'm just going to give you this
[1:26:44] free because I always I I always love
[1:26:46] this. The very next verse after Abraham
[1:26:48] gave tithing to Melazdc, the very next
[1:26:51] verse, the king of the country actually
[1:26:53] offered Abraham everything that they had
[1:26:55] all gained. He said, "I'm going to give
[1:26:57] you all the spoils. You can have all the
[1:26:59] possessions, everything that we want.
[1:27:00] You can have every bit of it." I
[1:27:01] thought, "Isn't that something?" Here
[1:27:03] was the first sign of a tithe paying
[1:27:05] church member was Abraham. And whenever
[1:27:06] he paid ti, the first thing was offer
[1:27:08] him was everything.
[1:27:10] And know, you know, now Abraham, he
[1:27:11] said, "Now, I won't take what a man
[1:27:12] gives me. I'm going to wait to see what
[1:27:14] God gives me." Notice now now Abra that
[1:27:17] was in the in the book of Genesis
[1:27:19] Hebrews 7 chapter Paul tells us what it
[1:27:22] was. He said Abraham gave a tenth part
[1:27:23] of all to Melazdc the king of Salem. He
[1:27:25] was the priest of the most high who met
[1:27:27] Abraham returning from the slaughter of
[1:27:29] the kings and he blessed him and he gave
[1:27:30] him a tenth. Now I I I was reading on
[1:27:33] this and I actually come across a
[1:27:34] question in question and answers. I
[1:27:36] thought I thought it was good. I'm going
[1:27:37] to read it this morning. But a person
[1:27:38] asked he said should a person pay tithe
[1:27:40] to an individual or should a Christian
[1:27:43] work? So there's two questions that's
[1:27:45] asked. I love how brother Bam answers
[1:27:46] these questions because the first thing
[1:27:47] he says, he said, "Well, sure, he should
[1:27:49] work. He's the one man that will work.
[1:27:51] That's a Christian." So let me just put
[1:27:53] that to bed. A son of God, he's going to
[1:27:55] work. He's going to take care of his
[1:27:56] family. He's going to raise his family.
[1:27:57] He's going to take care of business.
[1:27:59] That's a Christian. He said, "A
[1:28:00] Christian is the one man that will
[1:28:02] work." So we just put that make that
[1:28:04] easy. Then he asked the next question.
[1:28:06] Should he pay tithe to an individual?
[1:28:07] And I love this answer. He said, "Well,
[1:28:09] it depends on who the individual is."
[1:28:12] said, "See, because Hebrews 7, Abraham,
[1:28:14] when returning to the slaughter of the
[1:28:15] kings, he met Melazedc. He paid him a
[1:28:17] tithe." He said, "See, it was Melkazedc,
[1:28:19] the king of Salem, which is the king of
[1:28:21] peace, the king of righteousness, which
[1:28:23] was nobody but God himself." You notice
[1:28:25] why he's having to answer this is
[1:28:27] because there's been many men that would
[1:28:29] raise up to take tithing from people,
[1:28:30] say, "You write you write your tithing
[1:28:32] to me." And then they they go off and do
[1:28:34] all these things with people's money.
[1:28:35] So, so here he was making an answer to
[1:28:37] show what tithing was actually used for.
[1:28:39] He said, "See, it was given to it was
[1:28:40] given to nobody but God himself." He
[1:28:43] said, "So really, when you pay tithing,
[1:28:45] really where you owe tiths is where you
[1:28:48] get your food. For the Bible said,
[1:28:49] "Bring all your tithing into my
[1:28:51] storehouse, sayeth the Lord, and prove
[1:28:53] me where God said that that if I will
[1:28:55] not open the windows of heaven and pour
[1:28:57] out a blessing, that you do not have
[1:28:58] enough room to receive it." And said, "I
[1:29:01] challenge any man or woman that's not a
[1:29:02] tithe payer to accept that very thing."
[1:29:05] It's a it's a challenge. Matter of fact,
[1:29:06] it's the only place in the Bible that
[1:29:08] God says, "Prove me and see if I won't
[1:29:10] do it." It's a challenge that God gave
[1:29:12] to the believer to prove me and see if I
[1:29:14] won't see if I won't do it. But you
[1:29:15] notice he says, "So, he pays to the
[1:29:17] storehouse." That's why can I just lay
[1:29:19] this out here? Whenever we come to our
[1:29:21] church, we take up tithing and offering.
[1:29:23] And the purpose of our tithing is
[1:29:24] exactly what the scripture was used for.
[1:29:27] The tithing was to the Levite. It was
[1:29:29] for the purpose of the ministry. And
[1:29:31] that's what that's what we use our
[1:29:32] tithing for here. You think about we
[1:29:34] have ministers that come here. They
[1:29:35] travel all the way from from North
[1:29:37] Carolina and they come from Tennessee
[1:29:38] and they come from Ohio. We have
[1:29:40] ministers here in our local assembly
[1:29:41] that take time to preach the gospel. And
[1:29:44] so I've never been a person to feel like
[1:29:46] that tithing ought to go to the pastor.
[1:29:48] I don't believe that. I don't believe
[1:29:49] that all that that that the tithing
[1:29:50] would come in, although may not be a
[1:29:52] bunch, but but I don't I don't believe
[1:29:54] that that's only for the pastor. I
[1:29:55] believe it's for the ministry. It's for
[1:29:57] the Levite. And so as our church gives
[1:29:59] tithing, we always use that for that. We
[1:30:01] take care of the ministers. if they if
[1:30:03] they're going to come. You can't expect
[1:30:04] somebody to come all the way. I know. I
[1:30:06] may as well just lay it in here. We're
[1:30:07] here, but but you can't expect somebody
[1:30:09] to drive all the way across the country
[1:30:10] and spend $500 on gas or $500 on a plane
[1:30:14] ticket and take three days off of work
[1:30:15] and come in here and labor to bring the
[1:30:17] word of God to the people and and just
[1:30:19] say, "Well, I hope you have fun paying
[1:30:21] for it." But it ain't that way. That's
[1:30:22] why we have tithing. And so, the tithing
[1:30:24] actually pays for the support of the
[1:30:26] ministry. We have missionaries that we
[1:30:29] that I actually give part a part to. And
[1:30:31] that's according to how God had put it
[1:30:33] on my heart to do to to support those
[1:30:35] ministers, our local ministers. Whenever
[1:30:37] they come to minister, we do the same
[1:30:39] thing with them. We make sure that their
[1:30:41] time, the Bible says a man is worthy of
[1:30:43] his hire. And I believe that. I don't I
[1:30:45] don't want somebody coming up here and
[1:30:47] preaching to the church. I may as well
[1:30:48] just say it all. But but I don't want
[1:30:50] somebody coming up here preaching to the
[1:30:51] church that don't have nothing to say. I
[1:30:53] want the man to labor before the Lord if
[1:30:56] he has to take two days off of work to
[1:30:58] labor before the Lord and bring the mind
[1:31:00] of God for the people. So as a pastor,
[1:31:03] I'm willing to make sure that I paid for
[1:31:05] that time. So if it takes a week off of
[1:31:07] work to find the mind of God, then we'll
[1:31:09] pay for the time off work that you can
[1:31:11] bring the word of God to the children of
[1:31:13] God.
[1:31:15] So that's what our tithing is for. Amen.
[1:31:17] Is to bring the word of God. That's why
[1:31:19] we don't just get up here and make up a
[1:31:20] bunch of stuff or have somebody that's
[1:31:22] not prepared and give them a microphone
[1:31:23] and let them just come up here and start
[1:31:24] blasting on everybody and and and all
[1:31:27] this nonsense that that that that that
[1:31:29] people have seen through the years. But
[1:31:30] but we we want the word of God to be
[1:31:32] brought and people to be able to labor
[1:31:34] before the word. And so so we realize
[1:31:36] that according to the scripture to the
[1:31:38] Levite or to the priesthood, this is the
[1:31:39] purpose of tithing. So man would show
[1:31:41] this. He said, "See, I could stand here
[1:31:43] all morning telling you what happened
[1:31:45] when I seen that." He in other words, he
[1:31:47] said, I had to catch a revelation of it.
[1:31:48] He said, "And when what condition I was
[1:31:50] in, I was as loyal as I ever could. I
[1:31:52] paid tithe and I took my own money from
[1:31:54] the church, from the campaigns, and I
[1:31:55] gave a tenth. I give out to the
[1:31:57] ministers. I give to the rest of the
[1:31:59] ministers." And when I couldn't do that,
[1:32:00] you know what I did? When I got to a
[1:32:02] place that I couldn't do it, he said, "I
[1:32:04] kept 10% and I gave 90 of it to God." He
[1:32:07] said, "And notice I said, I would like
[1:32:09] to give you a personal testimony of how
[1:32:11] I was even hungry, my mother and them
[1:32:12] hungry, my daddy was sick, but I took my
[1:32:15] tithes out first and I give it to God.
[1:32:17] And you ought to see what happened. I
[1:32:19] have never seen in my life that any man
[1:32:20] or a woman that if you would only make
[1:32:23] $1 a week that you wouldn't give 10
[1:32:24] cents of that money and put it into your
[1:32:26] storehouse or the church that you come.
[1:32:28] If God wouldn't bless that, you can call
[1:32:31] me a hypocrite." He said, "That's a
[1:32:33] challenge to anybody, to every
[1:32:34] Christian. You should pay tithe." It's
[1:32:36] right. It should be done. So, we realize
[1:32:39] as a believers, it's it's the way to
[1:32:41] receive the blessing from God. How many
[1:32:44] I wonder how many could raise your hand
[1:32:45] and testify of something that God had
[1:32:47] done in your life because of because you
[1:32:49] were paying ti. My I remember I I I can
[1:32:52] I don't my wife won't mind that I tell
[1:32:53] this, but I remember my wife whenever
[1:32:56] she you know she uh was cleaning
[1:32:58] apartments and things and so they you
[1:33:00] know it wasn't very much money that they
[1:33:01] gave her. I forget how much it was, but
[1:33:03] but it wasn't very much. And so, well,
[1:33:05] you know, you know, after we we had
[1:33:08] started uh working and and you know, she
[1:33:10] comes to me one day and she says, you
[1:33:12] know, she says, well, you know, I I I
[1:33:14] need to be paying ti. I mean, you're the
[1:33:16] pastor. That's kind of odd thing. I
[1:33:17] said, well, it's only odd if you think
[1:33:19] you're paying tied to me. That'd be an
[1:33:21] odd thing. But don't pay ti to me.
[1:33:22] That's why I've always been a little bit
[1:33:24] weird about that. Y'all y'all know my
[1:33:25] nature, but I've always been a little
[1:33:27] bit weird about that. somebody come and
[1:33:28] trying to give you ti money. I don't but
[1:33:30] well it ain't to me so don't get you
[1:33:32] know I don't if you need to give it I'll
[1:33:33] take it and I'll give it to the brother
[1:33:35] but you know something like that but
[1:33:36] I've always been a little bit weird
[1:33:37] about it and that's just my own
[1:33:39] personality. So, so but but we want it
[1:33:41] to go to the right place and we want
[1:33:42] people to realize what it's for and
[1:33:44] where where it's actually going to. And
[1:33:46] so, so I told my wife, I said, "No, you
[1:33:48] go the church, you pay tithe to the
[1:33:50] church. That's our storehouse. That's
[1:33:51] where we feed you. Go through the right
[1:33:53] channel just like everybody else." And
[1:33:54] so she went out, she started doing it.
[1:33:56] She came back in in a week or two weeks
[1:33:58] time, she gets a she she gets a phone
[1:34:00] call from the manager and they said,
[1:34:02] "Hey, we're not paying you enough." He
[1:34:03] said, "We're going to double what we're
[1:34:04] paying you." And every apartment she
[1:34:06] cleaned, they gave her twice as much.
[1:34:07] And she came back. She said, "I can't
[1:34:09] believe this. This is the strangest
[1:34:10] thing, but it's just the way God works.
[1:34:12] Sometimes God I wonder how many have a
[1:34:14] similar testimony. Just raise your hand.
[1:34:15] Many of you all over the building. I I
[1:34:17] could stand here all day and I could
[1:34:19] tell you about what God has done in my
[1:34:22] life because I caught that revelation as
[1:34:24] a young man. I was a little boy. Don't
[1:34:26] you ever stop these children whenever
[1:34:27] they make 25 cents from coming and
[1:34:30] trying to put three cents in their
[1:34:31] little tithing envelope. I've got all
[1:34:33] kinds of them that them kids will give.
[1:34:35] And I pray over every one of them that
[1:34:36] comes in. I say, "God, you bless that
[1:34:38] child. You bless every part of their
[1:34:40] life according to thy word. I've never
[1:34:42] opened up a tithing envelope or or seen
[1:34:44] a tithing envelope in this church that I
[1:34:46] didn't pray that prayer over. God, bless
[1:34:47] them according to thy word. Even when
[1:34:49] they're little, don't stop them from
[1:34:51] from obeying the word of God because
[1:34:53] it's a blessing that God will follow
[1:34:55] after their life. As a young man, I
[1:34:57] caught that revelation. And I I would do
[1:34:59] and I would give more and give extra.
[1:35:01] And you know, you know, even I don't
[1:35:03] know if y'all remember this, but but we
[1:35:04] even when we were little and the church
[1:35:06] didn't have a the the brother in the
[1:35:08] church, he he wanted to I forgot all
[1:35:10] about this, but he wanted he wanted to
[1:35:12] to to turn the heat and air on in the
[1:35:14] church. And back then, we didn't have a
[1:35:16] thermostat that you could set. And so
[1:35:18] every day he he was talking about the
[1:35:19] trustee. He's passed away now, but he
[1:35:21] would come in the church and he would
[1:35:23] turn it on. He'd come in at four or five
[1:35:24] o'clock in the morning, turn the heat on
[1:35:25] or the air on. And he told that one day
[1:35:28] and something bothered me. I remember I
[1:35:29] was 12 years old. And so we got all the
[1:35:31] young people together and we went out
[1:35:33] raising money. Brother Morgan helped.
[1:35:35] Brother Mark help. We went out raising
[1:35:37] money. We collected cans off the side of
[1:35:39] the road. We went to people's trash and
[1:35:40] said, "Can we get the cans out of your
[1:35:42] garbage can?" It didn't matter where we
[1:35:44] got them. And we saved up enough
[1:35:45] aluminum cans to go to Lowe's and pay
[1:35:47] $60 for a thermostat that you could
[1:35:50] preset so that brother didn't have to
[1:35:51] get out of bed so early to turn the
[1:35:53] thermostat on. But it was children.
[1:35:56] It was just children that had a desire
[1:35:58] to do something for the Lord. Don't ever
[1:36:01] take that away from them.
[1:36:03] Little little button, my little buddy
[1:36:05] Chloe. Ever since she's been little
[1:36:07] bitty, she's always been that way. When
[1:36:09] she's started coming to church here, she
[1:36:11] she had put a dollar or two in ties from
[1:36:13] from baking her little from baking her
[1:36:15] little uh uh uh uh uh uh cakes that
[1:36:17] she'd make here in the winter. But she
[1:36:19] always put ties in. I thought my isn't
[1:36:20] that something that that a family or
[1:36:22] children would be raised in that way
[1:36:24] because it's a blessing of God. I
[1:36:26] thought that's a good daddy that would
[1:36:28] raise your children to be able to
[1:36:29] receive a blessing and not to receive
[1:36:32] the curse. See, see, so we always we
[1:36:35] always do that. Now notice that whenever
[1:36:37] we come into church, we take up an
[1:36:38] offering every service. Now the offering
[1:36:40] and the tithing was not the same thing.
[1:36:42] Now remember because the Bible said he
[1:36:44] said, "How have I robbed you?" He said,
[1:36:45] "You robbed me in tithing and offering."
[1:36:47] You realize that could have very easily
[1:36:49] said in offering and tithing. So, one's
[1:36:51] not more important or less important
[1:36:53] than the other. It's important. That's
[1:36:54] how we have a church. That's how we pay
[1:36:56] the light bills and all these things is
[1:36:57] the offerings that people give unto the
[1:37:00] church. And so, but but the offering, it
[1:37:02] was no set amount. It's something that's
[1:37:03] on your heart to give. There's no God
[1:37:05] didn't say there's certain amount. It's
[1:37:06] it's a free will offering. But let me
[1:37:08] tell you something about this offering
[1:37:09] that you give. Paul said 2 Corinthians
[1:37:12] 9th and 6. 9 and 6. He said, "But this I
[1:37:14] say, he which seweth sparingly shall
[1:37:16] also reap sparingly. But he which sweth
[1:37:19] bountifully shall reap bountifully. For
[1:37:21] every man according as he has purposed
[1:37:22] in his heart, so let him give, not
[1:37:24] grudgingly or out of necessity, for God
[1:37:26] loves a cheerful giver. So give from
[1:37:29] your heart what God puts on your heart
[1:37:30] to give." He said, "And God is able to
[1:37:33] make all grace abound toward you that
[1:37:35] you always having all sufficiency in all
[1:37:38] things may abound in every good work."
[1:37:40] So by the grace of God here that not
[1:37:43] only is the is a is a a blessing come
[1:37:45] from tithing but a blessing come from
[1:37:47] offering. Matter of fact, brother man
[1:37:48] would say this he that he he even
[1:37:50] corrected his own error. He said we went
[1:37:51] to a meeting in Canada one time and
[1:37:53] because we had the money we paid for the
[1:37:56] meeting. We do that a lot. Every time we
[1:37:57] go to India we try to pay for the
[1:37:59] meeting. He said but we paid for the
[1:38:00] meeting and we but we told them not to
[1:38:03] take up an offering because we had the
[1:38:04] money to pay for the meeting. He said it
[1:38:06] didn't go so good. the meetings are
[1:38:07] fine, but because we didn't take up an
[1:38:09] offer, because we didn't take up an
[1:38:11] offering, it didn't turn out so well. He
[1:38:13] said, "So, I don't care if the church is
[1:38:15] worth a hundred billion dollars, you
[1:38:17] still owe it to God to take up an
[1:38:19] offering because that's part of the
[1:38:20] people's worship." He said, "So don't
[1:38:22] rob that from them." He says, "As much
[1:38:24] as I've been against money and things
[1:38:26] like, you know, people after money," he
[1:38:28] said, "But I find out when a man is
[1:38:29] wrong, you may as well admit you're
[1:38:30] wrong." He said, "Brother Fred and I
[1:38:31] seen that it did not pan out so good. So
[1:38:33] it doesn't matter what the church is
[1:38:35] worth or how much money it has. You
[1:38:36] never neglect to pass an offering or
[1:38:39] give people an opportunity to give an
[1:38:41] offering unto the Lord. See, because it
[1:38:43] allows them to receive a blessing from
[1:38:45] God. This is a part of our worship. See,
[1:38:48] I can't find anywhere in the scripture,
[1:38:50] brother Jared, that being obedient to
[1:38:52] the word don't bring God's blessing.
[1:38:55] Every blessing of God comes from
[1:38:57] obedience to the word. And can I tell
[1:38:59] you this this morning? I I I know I know
[1:39:02] it's kind of drawing late, but the bank
[1:39:04] of heaven is not running low on funds.
[1:39:06] Can I just settle this in your mind?
[1:39:09] God ain't running low on funds. He's not
[1:39:12] He's not going to write a check that he
[1:39:13] can't cash. It's not He's not running
[1:39:16] short. He's not concerned about how much
[1:39:18] you draw or about how much he promises
[1:39:20] to one or how much he gives to another.
[1:39:22] God can give to one man just what he
[1:39:23] gives to another man. He's not running
[1:39:26] low. He's not running out. He's not.
[1:39:28] They're They're not running on fumes.
[1:39:31] It's an inexhaustible fountain. God
[1:39:33] don't write hot checks. God's checks
[1:39:36] don't bounce. Amen. Well, hallelujah.
[1:39:39] So, if God gives you a promise, you can
[1:39:41] take it to the bank. It's God's promise.
[1:39:43] His checks don't bounce. You can cash
[1:39:45] it. You can sign your name right on the
[1:39:46] back of it. You can walk right in and
[1:39:48] say, "It's from the bank of heaven. It
[1:39:49] was signed by Jesus Christ. It was paid
[1:39:51] for on the cross of Calvary. It's a
[1:39:54] blessing that God has promised me and my
[1:39:55] family." And you have access to draw the
[1:39:58] blessing of God out of the bank of
[1:40:00] heaven because God has wrote it to you.
[1:40:03] The blessings of God, they're promised.
[1:40:05] They they are promised to the believer.
[1:40:07] Think about it. They're promised to the
[1:40:09] believer through our covenant with God.
[1:40:10] Do I got just a minute? Can y'all give
[1:40:12] me can I get just about five minutes?
[1:40:14] See that the blessings of God are
[1:40:15] promised through the Abrahamic covenant.
[1:40:17] Remember the Bible says, "I will make of
[1:40:18] thee a great nation. I will bless thee.
[1:40:20] I will make thy name great, and thou
[1:40:22] shalt be a blessing. I will bless them
[1:40:24] that bless you. I will curse him that
[1:40:26] curse you and in thee shall all the
[1:40:28] families of the earth be blessed. I
[1:40:30] thought my isn't this something. Here is
[1:40:32] an unconditional covenant. But in that
[1:40:34] unconditional covenant comes a
[1:40:36] conditional blessing. I will bless them
[1:40:39] that bless thee. I will curse them that
[1:40:40] cur. The covenant is unconditional. But
[1:40:42] the blessing that you receive was
[1:40:44] unconditions. See, so the the more that
[1:40:47] you would give or the more that you
[1:40:48] would that you would follow after the
[1:40:50] word, everything you do for God, God
[1:40:52] would give something. And he would God
[1:40:53] will never let you. The the more you
[1:40:55] pray, the more of God you're going to
[1:40:56] give. The more you desire the spirit of
[1:40:58] God, the more the spirit of God you're
[1:41:00] going to give. God's never going to
[1:41:01] allow you to give out more than he gives
[1:41:03] you. You can't outgive him. So, see, so
[1:41:06] this is a promise of God. It's a it's a
[1:41:08] conditional blessing. So, according to
[1:41:10] being obedient to the word, but notice
[1:41:12] here, the seed of Abraham, which was
[1:41:14] Christ, this is where the blessing lay.
[1:41:17] So, Abraham, he was blessed because of
[1:41:19] the faith that he had in the promise. He
[1:41:21] and he was I thought my this is
[1:41:22] something that he was so much of a son
[1:41:25] of God. He was so blessed of God that
[1:41:27] God said if any man would even bless
[1:41:30] you, I'll bless that man. Amen. He was
[1:41:32] so blessed. Can you hear me? He was so
[1:41:34] blessed of God. He meant so much to God
[1:41:36] that God put this on his life that if a
[1:41:39] man would bless you, I'll bless that
[1:41:40] man. If a man curses you, I'll curse
[1:41:42] that man. Why? He meant so much to Can
[1:41:44] you imagine? This is what God is
[1:41:46] speaking. This is your covenant between
[1:41:47] you and God. Amen. that he is so blessed
[1:41:50] of God that if a man would bless you in
[1:41:51] the church age book, brother Bam said,
[1:41:53] "There are things that we must accept."
[1:41:54] Here's one of those things. He said,
[1:41:56] "There are those that will enter into
[1:41:58] life eternal after the white throne of
[1:42:01] judgment solely on the grounds and being
[1:42:04] good and kind and just to the elect of
[1:42:06] God." There are those that will enter
[1:42:08] into heaven solely on the grounds of
[1:42:11] being good to the bride of Jesus Christ
[1:42:12] or to the just of God. Is that not
[1:42:14] exactly what Abraham was preaching? I
[1:42:16] will bless them that bless you because
[1:42:19] they were a blessing to you and you're
[1:42:21] my son. I'm gonna You see how blessed
[1:42:23] you are to God that just because
[1:42:24] somebody done something good to you that
[1:42:27] God would bless their life because they
[1:42:28] would be a blessing to his children.
[1:42:31] That's why I don't speak cursings out of
[1:42:33] this mouth.
[1:42:35] Hello, somebody. Everybody has a choice
[1:42:37] to say what they want to say, but this
[1:42:39] mouth, see, you can control a lot of
[1:42:41] things about me, but that's one thing
[1:42:42] you can't control. You can't make me say
[1:42:44] things that I don't want to say. And I
[1:42:46] choose not to speak cursings over
[1:42:48] anybody because they might just be a son
[1:42:50] of God. They might just be a daughter of
[1:42:52] God. They might just be the seed of
[1:42:55] Abraham. And he said, "I'll bless those
[1:42:57] that bless you and curse those that
[1:42:58] curse thee. So I bless God's children. I
[1:43:02] don't speak cursings over them because I
[1:43:04] don't want that curse coming back on
[1:43:05] me." My boldness Oh, you say, "Well, you
[1:43:10] Well, I'm I'm just being bold." Well, my
[1:43:11] boldness as I can boldly give a blessing
[1:43:14] to the children of God. As boldly as you
[1:43:16] can curse them is as boldly as I can
[1:43:18] bless them. As boldly as you can put
[1:43:20] them down is as boldly as I can lift
[1:43:22] them up. As boldly as you can lift
[1:43:24] yourself over them is boldly as I can
[1:43:26] lower myself beneath them. Cuz I believe
[1:43:28] that God has an intention to bless his
[1:43:30] children and to raise them out of the
[1:43:32] muck of this layout of sea and set them
[1:43:34] in a plane where God can deliver his
[1:43:36] blessing upon their life. I can say that
[1:43:39] boldly.
[1:43:41] I can say that. I can say that that with
[1:43:44] the word of God behind me, God desires
[1:43:46] to bless his children. Said, see, just
[1:43:50] because they were good to the elect of
[1:43:52] God, that I would bless them. See, it's
[1:43:54] according to the Abrahamic covenant.
[1:43:56] I'll bless them that bless you. But
[1:43:57] notice, it wasn't just the Abrahamic
[1:43:58] covenant, and I'm closing, but also the
[1:44:01] Mosaic covenant. Watch Deuteronomy 28.
[1:44:03] God outlines the blessing for Israel if
[1:44:05] they would obey his commandments. It it
[1:44:07] what? Watch what it included.
[1:44:08] prosperity, health, victory over their
[1:44:10] enemies.
[1:44:12] The Davidic covenant when he came to
[1:44:13] David, he promised David's whole kingdom
[1:44:15] that it would endure forever and pointed
[1:44:17] out that this great blessing would be
[1:44:19] fulfilled in the Messiah. He would be a
[1:44:21] descendant of David of the throne of
[1:44:22] David. And here this great blessing
[1:44:24] would come. He would he he would keep
[1:44:26] his throne forever. He would be over his
[1:44:28] children forever. You say, "Well,
[1:44:30] brother Matt, that was a blessing for
[1:44:31] Abraham and that was a blessing for
[1:44:33] Moses and that was a blessing for David.
[1:44:35] That was a blessing for the children of
[1:44:36] Israel. But what about me? Can I just
[1:44:38] read it to you as we're closing? Paul
[1:44:40] said Ephesians 1:3, he said, "Blessed be
[1:44:42] the God and the Father of our Lord Jesus
[1:44:44] Christ, who hath blessed us." Somebody
[1:44:46] say, "Us." Us. With all, somebody say,
[1:44:49] "All." All spiritual blessings in
[1:44:52] heavenly places in Christ. So, it wasn't
[1:44:54] just for Moses, and it wasn't just for
[1:44:56] Abraham, and it wasn't just for David,
[1:44:58] but Paul said, "But God has blessed us."
[1:45:01] Somebody say, "Bless me." Bless me. God,
[1:45:04] you may as well just put yourself in
[1:45:05] there. Say it till you believe it. God
[1:45:07] has blessed me with all spiritual
[1:45:10] blessings that are in Christ Jesus. In
[1:45:13] other words, God has given you access to
[1:45:15] every spiritual blessing. You realize
[1:45:17] that these spiritual blessings, they are
[1:45:19] found. Notice, if you want to access
[1:45:21] these spiritual blessings, you've got to
[1:45:22] go to the right place. Amen. But what
[1:45:25] Paul said, he said they're found in
[1:45:27] Christ Jesus. So you can't just go out
[1:45:30] anywhere and find this spiritual
[1:45:32] blessing. There's all kinds of churches
[1:45:34] and places you can go to, but but if
[1:45:36] Christ ain't the head of that church,
[1:45:38] well, then you're not going to find that
[1:45:39] spiritual blessing there because the
[1:45:40] blessing is found in heavenly places in
[1:45:43] Christ. So, see, so there's a place in
[1:45:45] order for you to access them, you got to
[1:45:47] you got to you got to go to the right
[1:45:48] place. Now, it ain't just financial
[1:45:50] blessings, although I believe that I
[1:45:52] believe that God will bless your
[1:45:53] finances because he was blessing the
[1:45:54] field and blessing your food and
[1:45:56] blessing your cattle and blessing your
[1:45:57] sheep. That is what they use to to live
[1:45:59] on. So, God does bless us. He takes care
[1:46:01] of our bills. He takes care of us that
[1:46:03] way. But it's not just financial
[1:46:05] blessing, but God gives all spiritual
[1:46:08] blessings. They're all accessed in
[1:46:10] Christ Jesus. So here, believing God's
[1:46:12] word allows you to draw these blessings
[1:46:15] out of God. Oh, glory. So in other
[1:46:18] words, if in him is healing, then God
[1:46:20] give you a way to draw healing out of
[1:46:23] God. He give you a way to draw salvation
[1:46:26] out of him. He give you a way to draw
[1:46:28] peace out of him. You say, "How do we do
[1:46:30] it?" By faith. We draw these spiritual
[1:46:32] blessings out of him. See, you know, I
[1:46:35] think that what that what happens is is
[1:46:37] that people don't receive spiritual
[1:46:39] blessings because they're drawing from
[1:46:40] the wrong place. See, they try they try
[1:46:43] to draw them out of men or draw them out
[1:46:44] of a church, draw them out of a
[1:46:46] preacher, draw them out of a
[1:46:47] personality. That's where they're trying
[1:46:48] to draw their blessing from. But here he
[1:46:50] said, "But our blessing don't come out
[1:46:51] of a man. It don't come out of a pastor.
[1:46:53] It don't come out of a church. But your
[1:46:55] blessing comes out of Christ, who is the
[1:46:58] word of God. So if my blessing comes
[1:47:00] from the word, the only place I'm going
[1:47:01] to be able to draw it out of is to draw
[1:47:03] it out of the word, which is Christ
[1:47:05] Jesus. But don't you see this is our
[1:47:07] nature? Our nature is to draw out of
[1:47:10] something that we can see. It's our
[1:47:12] nature to pull from something that
[1:47:13] that's tangible, something we can put
[1:47:15] our hands on. We depend on things that
[1:47:17] we can conceive and we can control. That
[1:47:19] that that's what that's what our nature
[1:47:20] does. But here, the Bible's telling us
[1:47:22] that to draw out of Christ, it means
[1:47:24] that you have to draw from something
[1:47:26] that you can't see. That means our
[1:47:28] drawing is a draw of faith. It's what we
[1:47:31] draw on from. So by faith we draw from
[1:47:34] God. By faith we're pulling out of God.
[1:47:36] The Bible says by faith it comes by the
[1:47:38] hearing of the word, the the word of
[1:47:39] God. But Abraham said we accept that and
[1:47:42] we believe it that upon the basis of
[1:47:44] faith we are saved and we are healed. He
[1:47:47] said and whatever we draw from God it
[1:47:50] comes from an unseen resource. That
[1:47:53] means you may not be able to see it but
[1:47:55] it's there. Amen. You may not know it,
[1:47:57] but healing is laying there. Salvation
[1:47:59] is laying there. Deliverance is laying
[1:48:01] there. Peace is laying there. Joy is
[1:48:03] laying there. It's laying there. You may
[1:48:05] not see it. It's an unseen resource, but
[1:48:08] because of our faith, we draw out of a
[1:48:10] resource that we cannot see and we draw
[1:48:12] the things of God. Oh my. If you could
[1:48:14] get a picture of it this morning, it
[1:48:15] ain't some big bucket that we come up
[1:48:17] here and get some cracker or something
[1:48:19] from a priest. That ain't what we're
[1:48:20] trying to draw out of. But in the word
[1:48:22] of God, by faith, we reach down or we
[1:48:25] reach up and we draw from God out of an
[1:48:27] unseen resource. God, I need some joy in
[1:48:30] my life. And by faith, I reach up and I
[1:48:32] begin to draw. Lord, I need peace in my
[1:48:34] life. And by faith, I reach up and I
[1:48:36] begin to draw. Lord, my children need
[1:48:38] salvation. By faith, I reach up and I
[1:48:41] begin to draw out of God where the
[1:48:44] spiritual blessings lay, out of an
[1:48:47] unseen resource. and to draw a blessing
[1:48:50] that is very visible.
[1:48:52] It becomes manifested in my life out of
[1:48:55] an unseen source. He said, "See,
[1:48:57] Christians, the whole armor of
[1:48:59] Christianity is based on faith.
[1:49:01] Everything that we have is unseen. The
[1:49:03] only things that's real is unseen.
[1:49:05] They're unexplained. But the things that
[1:49:07] can be explained aren't even real.
[1:49:08] They're superficial and they die. They
[1:49:10] cannot be." Isn't that what the Bible
[1:49:12] says? All this that they given, a man
[1:49:13] could earn great wealth, but he's going
[1:49:15] to come into this world naked and out of
[1:49:16] this world he's going to leave the same
[1:49:17] way. And nothing that he's gained is
[1:49:19] ever going to go with him. The only
[1:49:20] thing that'll go with him is the unseen
[1:49:22] thing.
[1:49:23] Watch the where the real value is. The
[1:49:26] unseen thing. That's what that man will
[1:49:28] carry with him on the other side.
[1:49:31] See, it's unseen. The it cannot be
[1:49:34] explained. The immortal, the whole
[1:49:35] realm. Look at the armor of
[1:49:37] Christianity. Love. What part of you is
[1:49:39] love? Somebody point to it. Say, see
[1:49:43] love and joy and faith, longsuffering,
[1:49:45] meekness and patience. None of these
[1:49:47] things, you can't see them. They're
[1:49:48] unseen, but we believe them. See, love
[1:49:51] never dies. Faith is the victory. We
[1:49:54] believe the things that we don't see.
[1:49:56] And those that truly believe the test,
[1:49:58] think of this. Those that truly believe
[1:50:00] the testimony of Jesus Christ can draw
[1:50:02] God's blessings. Amen. Out of him. Yes,
[1:50:05] sir. The Bible says God was in Christ
[1:50:08] reconciling the world to himself. He
[1:50:10] said those that truly believe that God
[1:50:12] was in Christ, reconciling the world to
[1:50:15] himself. Those that truly believe that
[1:50:17] can go draw God's blessing out of him.
[1:50:20] Amen. Where's our spiritual blessings?
[1:50:22] They are in Christ. Said so in Christ
[1:50:24] the word we can draw out of him. But
[1:50:26] Abraham said in another place he said it
[1:50:28] takes a prayer of faith to bring God's
[1:50:31] blessing down. Hallelujah. See, it just
[1:50:33] takes some drawing from the right
[1:50:35] source. Would you stand to your feet
[1:50:36] this morning? When we draw out of the
[1:50:39] right source, see where you're drawing
[1:50:40] from. If you're drawing from a well and
[1:50:42] it's full of old dirty water, well,
[1:50:45] anybody want to know what kind of water
[1:50:46] you're going to get, you're going to get
[1:50:48] the water from the well that you're
[1:50:50] drawing from. So, see, so here that God
[1:50:55] has given us a source to draw from in
[1:50:57] Christ. God was in Christ reconciling
[1:51:01] the world to himself that us through
[1:51:03] Christ could receive every blessing of
[1:51:05] God. Amen. That's why we come here and
[1:51:09] gather up in the house of God.
[1:51:11] fellowship around the word. We worship
[1:51:13] in the word of God for the mark because
[1:51:15] we're drawing from a resource. I say,
[1:51:19] Lord, pour your blessing out upon the
[1:51:21] church. I know what the church the
[1:51:23] church world thinks that, well, if you
[1:51:25] have a big enough building, well, then
[1:51:26] you're blessed. Then you're receiving
[1:51:28] the blessing of God because your
[1:51:29] building's big enough because your
[1:51:30] windows are pretty enough because you
[1:51:32] got a bunch of people going there.
[1:51:33] Everybody's everybody's well off. But
[1:51:35] that ain't what the blessing of God is
[1:51:36] upon a church. He said, "All these
[1:51:38] churches, denominations that hold to
[1:51:40] their tradition of men instead of the
[1:51:42] word of God, they aren't blessed of God.
[1:51:44] You're cursed by God." No matter how big
[1:51:46] the building is, they're living under a
[1:51:48] curse because they fail to receive the
[1:51:50] word of God. Said, "But what we need to
[1:51:52] do is to get back to the message." How
[1:51:54] many say amen? Get back to the original.
[1:51:57] Get back to Pentecost. Get back to the
[1:51:59] real blessing. Back to the name of Jesus
[1:52:02] Christ. Back to the baptism of the Holy
[1:52:04] Ghost. Back to signs and wonders. back
[1:52:06] to Pentecost, away with organization,
[1:52:08] and back to the Holy Ghost. He's our
[1:52:10] teacher.
[1:52:12] That's when the blessing of God can take
[1:52:14] over your life. My isn't that wonderful
[1:52:18] to not only to be the blessed of God,
[1:52:20] but to receive a blessing from God. I
[1:52:22] say, Lord, open the windows of heaven
[1:52:25] over my life. I'm not ashamed of it.
[1:52:28] Lord, open the windows of heaven over my
[1:52:30] life. Let me follow thy word. Lord, let
[1:52:32] me be obedient to th to to thy word. And
[1:52:34] Lord, let you bless my life. Let me be a
[1:52:36] testimony of the blessing of God. I
[1:52:38] ain't ashamed of it one bit. Amen. We
[1:52:40] ain't afraid to be blessed of God. Lord,
[1:52:42] let me be so filled with with with peace
[1:52:44] that that when these great trials come
[1:52:46] that I can stand as a son of God and
[1:52:48] say, "It's okay. God's going to take
[1:52:50] care of it." Lord, let me be so filled
[1:52:52] with love that when somebody would do me
[1:52:53] wrong, I can say, "Well, it's okay. I'm
[1:52:55] going to love them anyhow." And and
[1:52:57] until they till their heart changes, let
[1:53:00] me be so filled with the blessing of God
[1:53:02] that it's manifested in my life.
[1:53:05] Amen. It ain't something we got to be
[1:53:06] ashamed of. It's something that we can
[1:53:08] display. Brother Mark, can you imagine
[1:53:10] the unseen blessings being on display in
[1:53:15] your life? Ain't God wonderful? Can we
[1:53:17] sing that song? Ain't God good? He gives
[1:53:21] us so many blessings
[1:53:25] undeserving. That's what we are.
[1:53:29] We ought to thank him, love and praise
[1:53:33] him a little more today and a whole lot
[1:53:37] more
[1:53:38] tomorrow. Well, ain't God
[1:53:40] good to give us so many blessings

[1:54:28] are. We ought to thank
[1:54:31] him and praise him a little more today
[1:54:36] and a whole lot more tomorrow. Now, let
[1:54:39] me ask you, how many knows the greatest
[1:54:40] thing you can say to
[1:54:42] somebody? God bless you. So won't you go
[1:54:44] around and shake somebody's hand and and
[1:54:46] and wish that upon them. Won't you give
[1:54:49] that blessing to them? May God bless
[1:54:51] you. Give us so many blessings
[1:54:56] undeserving. That's what we
[1:54:58] are. We ought to thank him. Love and
[1:55:02] praise him a little more today and a
[1:55:06] whole lot more tomorrow.

[1:55:22] praise him a little more today and a
[1:55:26] whole lot more tomorrow. Yes, my God is
[1:55:30] good.
[1:55:32] So many blessings undeserved.
[1:55:36] That's what we
[1:55:37] ought. We ought to thank him, love, and
[1:55:42] praise him a little more today and a
[1:55:45] whole lot more tomorrow.

[1:55:50] good all the
[1:55:52] time. He put a song of praise in this
[1:55:57] heart of mine. God is
[1:56:00] good all the
[1:56:02] time. In the darkest night, his light
[1:56:07] will shine. God is
[1:56:09] good. My God is

[1:56:19] valley and there are shadows all
[1:56:24] around, do not fear,
[1:56:28] for he will guide you. He will keep you

[1:57:21] die. And he filled me with his spirit.
[1:57:26] Now I can stand and
[1:57:30] testify that his
[1:57:32] love is
[1:57:35] everlasting and his

[2:01:40] [Music]
[2:01:41] Amen. Won't you give him a great hand
[2:01:43] clap of praise? Somebody say, "Praise
[2:01:44] the Lord this morning." Has he been good
[2:01:46] to you? Somebody give him praise. Lord,
[2:01:49] we thank you for what you've done for
[2:01:51] me. Lord, I thank you for my family. I
[2:01:53] thank you for blessing me, Lord. I thank
[2:01:56] you for all that you've given me. I
[2:01:57] thank you for health in my body. Lord, I
[2:01:59] come to worship you and to give you
[2:02:01] praise. Friends, don't be don't be beat
[2:02:04] down and discouraged. God has come to
[2:02:07] bless his children. Can I finish reading
[2:02:10] this?
[2:02:11] Moses said, "It shall come to pass, if
[2:02:13] thou shalt hearken diligently unto the
[2:02:15] voice of the Lord thy God, and observe
[2:02:17] to do his commandments, which I command
[2:02:18] you this day, then the Lord thy God will
[2:02:21] set thee on high above all the nations
[2:02:24] of the earth." Sometimes we get to
[2:02:26] feeling so low and down, but listen what
[2:02:28] God's intention is is to establish you
[2:02:30] on high. How many will accept that? He's
[2:02:33] going to set you on high, and all of
[2:02:35] these blessings shall come on thee and
[2:02:38] overtake thee. I don't know about y'all.
[2:02:40] Glory,
[2:02:42] but I want to be overtaken by the
[2:02:45] blessings of God. The window that's big
[2:02:47] enough to pour out a blessing that's
[2:02:49] enough to overtake me. I say, God,
[2:02:51] overtake my life. Whether you realize
[2:02:54] what God is trying to do for you,
[2:02:55] brother Mark, if you hearken under the
[2:02:57] voice of the Lord, Lord thy God here
[2:02:59] today that people are overtaken by so
[2:03:01] many things. You've been overtaken by
[2:03:03] guilt, overtaken by doubt, overtaken by
[2:03:06] sadness, overtaken by sorrow, overtaken
[2:03:09] by sickness. But he said, "But God will
[2:03:11] overtake you with the blessings of God."
[2:03:15] I say, Lord, overtake every doubt. Take
[2:03:18] take me over. You can be bound if you
[2:03:21] want to, but I I choose to be overtaken
[2:03:23] by the blessings of God. God, overtake
[2:03:24] me with liberty. If I'm sad, overtake me
[2:03:27] with joy. If I'm lost, overtake me with
[2:03:29] salvation. If I'm sick, overtake me with
[2:03:32] healing. Let the blessings of God
[2:03:34] overtake my life. Hallelujah. Somebody
[2:03:36] praise the Lord this morning. Isn't he
[2:03:40] wonderful? Well, everybody will be
[2:03:44] happy. Well, there's a happy land of
[2:03:47] promise over in the great beyond where

[2:04:26] us and kept us by his grace. Brought me
[2:04:30] to a land both proud and
[2:04:33] fair. And I will praise his name
[2:04:36] forever. As I look upon his face,

[2:05:58] there. But I say

[2:06:13] God's praises. Everybody will be happy
