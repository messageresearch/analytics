[41:11] deserve the glory
[41:14] and the honor.
[41:17] So Lord, I lift my voice to worship, to

[41:54] [Music]
[41:57] How many say he's great?
[42:00] &gt;&gt; Lord, you're such a wonderful God.
[42:03] In the darkest hour of my life, you were
[42:06] there.
[42:07] &gt;&gt; When I needed you the most, you were
[42:10] there. You've you've never failed me.
[42:12] You've never forsaken me. You've never
[42:14] left me alone
[42:16] &gt;&gt; in my greatest trial. You know, it
[42:18] reminds me of that story of the man that
[42:22] saw the footprints in the sands of time
[42:24] and he looked down and there was two
[42:28] sets of footprints and then after little
[42:30] while it turned to one and he said,
[42:33] "Lord," he said, "How is it that when I
[42:35] went through my greatest trial, there
[42:37] was only one set of footprints? How is
[42:39] it that that in the darkest time of my
[42:42] life, that's when you left me? you walk
[42:43] with me all the time, but when I got
[42:45] into my greatest trial, you forsaken me.
[42:49] And he replied to him. He said, "No, I
[42:51] didn't forsake you." He said, "But that
[42:53] was the moment that I was carrying you,
[42:55] &gt;&gt; friends. I don't know about you, but
[42:56] that's what I want to see in my life.
[42:58] Lord, let there be just one set of
[42:59] footprints. Let me cast my cares upon
[43:02] you and let you carry me through my time
[43:05] of trouble." Amen. You love the Lord
[43:08] this morning. Amen. You believe that
[43:10] he's here with us. Amen.
[43:13] &gt;&gt; We have a prayer request for very needed
[43:16] unspoken request this morning. Brother
[43:19] had turned in. Also pray for Ruth Anne
[43:22] and her family. That is my cousin Ruth
[43:26] Anne. And also for Uncle Randall,
[43:31] continue to help them. And also want to
[43:34] remember sister Brooke Roberts and her
[43:37] son is sick this morning. Many that are
[43:40] sick. We just want to remember them in
[43:42] prayer. I believe God is more than able
[43:44] to meet our needs this morning. We're a
[43:45] needy people, but we have a a God that
[43:48] we can turn to in a time of need. So,
[43:50] why don't we just ask the Lord to come
[43:52] and meet these needs? Could you pray
[43:53] with me? If you have something on your
[43:55] heart, just ask the Lord to come by and
[43:57] speak to your heart. Gracious heavenly
[43:59] father, Lord, how honored that we are,
[44:02] Lord, to stand in your presence this
[44:04] morning. And Lord, I feel such a
[44:06] wonderful atmosphere. Lord, there's
[44:08] nothing greater than than walking into
[44:11] your presence, Lord, and seeing the work
[44:13] that you're doing among your children.
[44:15] Lord, I can look out across this
[44:17] congregation this morning, Lord, and see
[44:19] many, Lord, that are sick and not able
[44:21] to be here, uh, some that had gone,
[44:24] Lord, Brother Roy and his family and
[44:27] Sister Lori, to the funeral and, Lord,
[44:30] that lost a loved one. Lord, I pray that
[44:32] you would help each one of them.
[44:34] Lord, those that are sick this morning,
[44:35] Lord, I pray that you would touch their
[44:37] bodies. Lord, we just ask you, Lord,
[44:39] that you would come and commune with us
[44:41] as a body of believers. Lord, we come to
[44:43] draw from you. And Lord, we ask you,
[44:45] Lord, that you would just pour your
[44:47] spirit out upon the church, Lord. That
[44:48] we would leave this place knowing that
[44:50] we've been in your presence, Lord. We
[44:53] just thank you for all you do for us,
[44:54] Lord. And we'll just be careful to give
[44:56] you the glory for everything that's
[44:58] done. Lord, we pray that you would
[44:59] anoint this word, Lord. Let it be
[45:01] edifying to the church.
[45:02] God, may we just lay everything aside
[45:05] this morning, Lord, and just draw from
[45:07] you, Lord, as a minister, God, may I get
[45:09] out of the way, Lord, and as the
[45:11] hearers, Lord, may we just get out of
[45:13] the way, Lord, just to take a few
[45:15] moments, Lord, and fellowship around
[45:17] your word, Lord. Can we cast our our our
[45:19] thoughts and things aside, Lord, that we
[45:21] could just dig into the word and draw
[45:23] from the the word of God, Lord, this
[45:25] morning, Lord. May you speak something
[45:27] that would be a help to the church.
[45:28] Lord, we ask you to take your liberty
[45:30] now in Jesus Christ's name we pray and
[45:34] the church says amen. Amen. We just want
[45:38] to invite you to the scripture to the
[45:39] book of Ephesians. And amen. We just
[45:43] sure appreciate all of our musicians.
[45:45] Sure enjoyed those songs this morning.
[45:47] How many enjoyed those those specials?
[45:49] Amen. I said, how many enjoyed those
[45:50] specials this I know it's hard to clap
[45:52] with your Bible in your hand, but we
[45:54] knew who had a Bible and who didn't.
[45:56] Only two people clap. But glory. Amen.
[46:00] That ain't even right, is it? Asking
[46:02] people to clap when they holding their
[46:04] Bibles. Well, at least everybody's
[46:05] packing their Bibles. I I love to see a
[46:07] church coming to the house of God
[46:09] carrying a Bible. Amen. I It's our
[46:11] sword. And I I sure sure appreciate
[46:13] that. But I I enjoyed those songs. Enjoy
[46:16] our musicians. And I I've always had a a
[46:19] real uh zeal uh on our heart to work
[46:22] with our young people in in music. And
[46:25] so we sure appreciate appreciate all of
[46:27] them and singing and the things. We had
[46:29] a you our youth uh uh meeting yesterday
[46:32] and had a wonderful time. Brother Brian
[46:34] had shareh shared some things with the
[46:37] youth. I know they really enjoyed it and
[46:38] many of them had told me afterwards how
[46:41] the Lord had really spoke to them and so
[46:43] we uh sure enjoyed that time of
[46:46] fellowship and and we sure appreciate
[46:48] what God's done. And you know even Salem
[46:50] was there and he's not young no more. I
[46:52] don't know if y'all knew that, but he
[46:53] he's not a youth. He's done an adult
[46:55] now. He done turned 18 this week. And uh
[46:58] so we got a we got a a new man of the
[47:01] house. So we just appreciate the I I I
[47:06] mean it's okay. I talk about everybody
[47:07] else's kids, so I guess it's okay to
[47:09] talk about my own. But he's a fine young
[47:11] man, and I sure appreciate him uh
[47:13] serving the Lord all these years, and
[47:15] and he's always uh had a wonderful
[47:17] testimony. So, I sure appreciate his
[47:20] stand for the gospel as a young man.
[47:22] Even as a little boy, uh he's always had
[47:24] a heart of a servant. And I always
[47:26] notice um the sister that's passed on
[47:29] now, she always uh bragged on him
[47:31] because she said every time I come to
[47:33] the church, he had come out and and uh
[47:35] and let me in the door and park my car.
[47:37] And I said, "Well, sis, I yeah, he's a
[47:39] real servant. He just wants to drive
[47:40] your car." But no, he really just wanted
[47:43] to be a help. And so I I I sure
[47:46] appreciate that in the in in a young man
[47:49] and every every young man. I was so
[47:51] proud of our our our youth yesterday. We
[47:54] had a Bible trivia and and the the
[47:56] things they knew the answer to was
[47:58] astonishing. And you know, it's a
[47:59] reflection on your ministry. If they
[48:02] actually I say it was a reflection on
[48:03] the Sunday school. If they don't know
[48:05] the answers, it's the Sunday school
[48:06] teachers fault. And if they did know the
[48:08] answers, well then it was my fault. I
[48:10] tried to play that, but it didn't it
[48:12] didn't work. But it it was uh it was uh
[48:14] amazing how many answers they knew. I
[48:17] even uh on one question me and brother
[48:19] Brian said, "Well, y'all going to get a
[48:21] free point. If you we had a subject and
[48:23] and and said the the answer to the
[48:25] subject said, "If you can tell us who
[48:27] preached that message in our church,
[48:29] then I'll give you a bonus point." And
[48:31] Kobe raised his hand. He said it was
[48:33] Brother David Siler four years ago in
[48:35] our anniversary meeting.
[48:36] said, "Man, they've been paying some
[48:38] attention
[48:39] &gt;&gt; uh to know that that not only the answer
[48:41] to the question, but who preached the
[48:43] message four years ago?" It was I I I
[48:46] just appreciate our How many enjoys our
[48:48] young people?
[48:49] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[48:50] God bless you. We're a talented group.
[48:55] Amen. I sure appreciate them. But I want
[48:57] to uh re uh preach out of Ephesians.
[48:59] We're going to read Ephesians the first
[49:01] chapter and the 18th verse. And amen, we
[49:03] just enjoy the liberty this morning to
[49:05] come and uh trust that the Lord will
[49:07] speak something out of his word. And I
[49:09] believe the word of God is the most
[49:11] important thing in our life. Amen. I
[49:12] believe we can open this and find
[49:14] something uh that God will bring to help
[49:16] us. And if you'll help me, I I'm not
[49:19] much of a preacher. I get in trouble
[49:20] sometimes. Y'all pick on me for saying
[49:22] that, but that's the way I really feel.
[49:23] But I believe if God shows up, then then
[49:26] things are done. Amen. And we can get
[49:27] something out of the word. So, I want to
[49:29] read from Ephesians the first chapter.
[49:31] We're going to read out the 18th verse.
[49:33] The Bible said, "The eyes of your
[49:35] understanding." How many how many
[49:36] remembers what that was? It was our
[49:38] heart. So the eyes of your understanding
[49:41] being enlightened that you may know what
[49:43] the is the hope of his calling and what
[49:45] the riches of the glory of his
[49:48] inheritance in the saints. And we'll
[49:50] just ask the Lord to add his blessing to
[49:52] the reading of the word as you take your
[49:53] seats. And I would like to take I I two
[49:56] weeks ago I had read this scripture or
[49:58] actually we had preached out of this
[49:59] scripture on open the eyes of my heart
[50:01] and I want to take this scripture this
[50:03] morning just as a foundation and I'd
[50:06] like to speak on the revealing of
[50:08] redemption. The revealing of redemption.
[50:10] Now we read or read this uh uh scripture
[50:13] even last time. Now we uh remember that
[50:16] when Paul was speaking he was trying to
[50:17] get something to the church. He was
[50:19] actually uh preaching a message and
[50:21] praying that the eyes of the heart would
[50:23] be open that the church would come to a
[50:25] certain place. This has always been the
[50:27] purpose of Paul. Paul was an apostle, a
[50:29] messenger uh to the gentile church. And
[50:31] so he was trying to bring the church to
[50:33] a place of revelation or a place of of
[50:35] understanding. He says so that the eyes
[50:37] of your heart would be enlightened. Now
[50:39] we we realized that whenever we had
[50:40] preached this last time, I know many
[50:42] were at the youth camp, but this word
[50:44] understanding had actually came from the
[50:46] Greek word cardia which meant heart. So
[50:48] when Paul said, "Open the eyes of your
[50:50] heart." And that word, it was not
[50:52] referring to the flesh of a heart or the
[50:54] organ of a heart, but it was actually
[50:56] referring to the inner self or the
[50:58] character of a man. And matter of fact,
[51:00] if you'd read the uh uh the the
[51:02] definition of cardia, it actually says
[51:05] the center or the seat of your spiritual
[51:07] life. This is what Paul was speaking of,
[51:09] the seat of your spiritual life. That's
[51:11] why brother Brandon when he would talk
[51:12] about a man's heart, he would say this.
[51:14] He say there's a compartment in a man's
[51:16] heart that God has made there for
[51:18] himself. It's a throne in a man's heart
[51:21] and that is his control room. He said
[51:23] see how can you work with the nature if
[51:25] the spirit of the devil is in that
[51:26] place. He said but every man that is
[51:28] born on the earth is born in sin. He's
[51:30] shaped in iniquity. He comes to the
[51:31] world speaking lies and every one of us
[51:33] that are born have that carnal Adamic
[51:36] nature the nature of Adam and we so how
[51:38] can we achieve anything but only through
[51:40] intellect because there's one that's
[51:42] sitting on the throne of our heart. But
[51:44] he said, "But then whenever you become a
[51:46] new creature and the old man leaves out
[51:48] of there and then comes a new man which
[51:51] is Christ and Christ takes his seat on
[51:53] the throne of a human heart, then life
[51:55] looks differently. He starts on a new
[51:57] road. His desires change." How many can
[51:59] testify of that this morning? Your
[52:01] desire changes. Your selfish motive
[52:03] changes. All the big ideas that you had
[52:05] of yourself, everything changes. He
[52:07] said, "And you turn towards Calvary and
[52:08] you recognize God. than your objective,
[52:10] your motive, your achievement, and all
[52:13] that you are lays in the glory of the
[52:16] cross. I thought that's a powerful
[52:17] statement that a man can get to a place
[52:19] that everything that you ever achieve
[52:21] and everything you do in this life lays
[52:23] to the glory of the cross. In other
[52:25] words, all that I do and all that I
[52:27] gain, let God get the glory. Let the
[52:29] glory go to the cross of Calvary, for I
[52:31] would be nothing outside of the cross of
[52:33] Calvary. This was the Paul the message
[52:35] that Paul was preaching that that the
[52:37] eye of your heart would be open that you
[52:39] would see things that you couldn't see
[52:41] with your natural eye that God would
[52:43] inhabit the throne of a human heart. Now
[52:45] uh last Sunday we had actually took this
[52:47] scripture and talked about Elisha and
[52:49] Gahhesa and how that that Elisha saw
[52:52] what Gahesa didn't see. Remember the
[52:54] army that was encamped around the
[52:55] battle. But but Elisha's prayer was that
[52:58] God would open the eyes. I I thought
[53:00] when I read that that's why I used that
[53:02] last Sunday is Elisha prayed the same
[53:05] prayer that Paul was praying in the book
[53:07] of Ephesians is that Lord would you open
[53:10] his eyes that he could see what he can't
[53:12] see now. So he said I pray that you
[53:14] would open his eyes and I here's
[53:16] something that I found powerful in that
[53:17] last time is that God didn't change what
[53:20] was going on around Elisha but God just
[53:23] opened the eye of the servant that he
[53:25] could see that there was more for him
[53:26] than there was against him. I thought,
[53:28] isn't that the way God does whenever
[53:29] you're praying for an answer and looking
[53:31] for a a revelation? God, it's not
[53:34] changing the circumstances, but but God,
[53:36] may you open my eye to see your hand in
[53:39] the circumstances that I'm going
[53:40] through. And so you you you see that
[53:42] that there was something that Elisha saw
[53:44] that Gahesa didn't see. You say, "Well,
[53:46] how could Elisha see it and Gahesa not
[53:48] see it?" But remember said because
[53:50] Elisha was just accustomed or used to
[53:52] walking by faith. That was just what he
[53:54] done. I I thought, isn't that something?
[53:56] On a daily basis, Elisha just walked by
[53:58] faith. That was his that was his daily
[54:00] walk. He walked by faith. He said, "See,
[54:02] so he was looking at the unseen all the
[54:04] time." I I thought that was powerful
[54:06] that Elisha, he didn't have to leave the
[54:08] house. He he never he never went outside
[54:11] looking around at the army. He wasn't
[54:13] running uh uh to try to find an answer.
[54:15] He said, "But Elisha saw that anyway. He
[54:17] saw it by faith because he knew what the
[54:20] book of Psalms said that the angels of
[54:22] God are encamped around those that fear
[54:24] him. He says, "So, so if if Elisha knew
[54:27] according to the scripture that the
[54:29] angels of God were encamped about them,"
[54:31] he said, then then then he didn't have
[54:33] to go outside and see it with his
[54:35] natural eye because he knew it by faith.
[54:37] He knew it, Brother Salem. He knew it by
[54:38] scripture. He he knew it by faith. He
[54:40] knew that that uh that that that God had
[54:42] called them, that God uh that God would
[54:45] have a way out for them. He says, see,
[54:47] so he never saw the angels. He said he
[54:49] never saw the chariots of fire. He
[54:51] didn't see those things with his natural
[54:53] eye, but he saw a Bible promise that in
[54:56] the time of trouble that the angels of
[54:58] God would be encamped around about them.
[55:00] And he believed that the Bible promise
[55:02] as a reality. I I thought, isn't that
[55:04] something? So, in other words, Elisha
[55:06] was blessed. Can I say that? I I I know
[55:09] there's a lot of distraction, but we're
[55:10] I'm going to preach anyway. But but
[55:12] Elisha was blessed. How many believe
[55:13] that this morning? Elisha was blessed.
[55:15] He was blessed of God. Can I I can say
[55:17] that by scripture. There was a blessing
[55:19] that was upon Elisha that caused him to
[55:21] see things that he could not see with
[55:23] his natural eye. Elisha was blessed. He
[55:26] said, you say, "Well, how can you say he
[55:27] was blessed?" You remember Thomas when
[55:29] he came to meet Jesus. And he and and he
[55:31] couldn't believe that that was Jesus
[55:33] when he came there. But Jesus said unto
[55:35] him, remember he wanted to touch his
[55:36] hand. He wanted to to feel the nail
[55:38] prints. I I don't believe that's you,
[55:40] Lord. I you know, after all, it don't
[55:42] look the same with my natural eye. But
[55:44] Jesus said unto him after he touched his
[55:46] hand, he said, "Now I can believe." He
[55:48] said, Jesus, he said, uh, uh, Thomas, he
[55:51] said, you believe because you seen me
[55:53] and it made you believe. He said, but I
[55:55] say this, but blessed are they that
[55:58] believe that have not seen. So I can say
[56:00] that this morning that Elisha was
[56:02] blessed. He may not have seen it with
[56:03] his natural eye, but Jesus said, "But
[56:06] because you can't see it with your
[56:07] natural eye and you believe it anyway,
[56:09] then you're more blessed than the man
[56:11] that's seen it with his natural eye." I
[56:12] I I I I just think that's something
[56:14] about people. They're always looking. I
[56:16] want to see a supernatural and I want to
[56:18] see a great sign and I want to see signs
[56:20] of the heaven and I want to see a pillar
[56:22] of fire, but there's some that believe
[56:24] the same word. They never saw a pillar
[56:25] of fire, but they're believers. They
[56:27] never saw the supernatural, but they're
[56:29] believers. They never saw the lame get
[56:31] up and walk, but they're still
[56:32] believers. And Jesus said, "More blessed
[56:34] is he that has not seen, but still yet
[56:37] he still believes."
[56:39] You might not have seen the miracles
[56:40] that Jesus performed, but blessed are
[56:43] you that you believe. How many believe
[56:44] that this morning? I said, how many
[56:46] believers do we have here this morning?
[56:48] Jesus said, "You are blessed because you
[56:50] did not see, but you're still a
[56:52] believer." Blessed are you. You didn't
[56:54] see Moses when he parted the Red Sea.
[56:56] But how many believe it this morning?
[56:57] Well, you're blessed. You didn't see the
[56:59] light when it came to Paul on the road
[57:01] to Damascus. But how many believe there
[57:03] was a lie that came down and and gave
[57:05] Paul his commission? He said, "Blessed
[57:07] are you that believe that have not seen.
[57:10] &gt;&gt; You're more blessed." I I can just say
[57:12] that this morning. And you didn't see
[57:14] God give a fish back its life, but you
[57:16] believe it. Therefore, you're blessed.
[57:18] You wasn't in India when a woman that
[57:19] hadn't walked in six years. And she and
[57:22] the Lord came by and spoke to her that
[57:23] she couldn't even walk on her own and
[57:25] she rose up on her two feet and came
[57:27] walking to the building. You didn't see
[57:29] it with your natural eye, but you
[57:30] believe it. Therefore, you're blessed.
[57:32] You didn't see it whenever the prophet
[57:34] came and he spoke squirrels into
[57:36] existence. You didn't see squirrels
[57:38] appear on a limb, but you believe it.
[57:40] Therefore, you are blessed.
[57:42] &gt;&gt; No wonder had right receive such a
[57:44] blessing because Jesus said, "Blessed is
[57:46] he that believes that has not seen."
[57:49] &gt;&gt; No wonder the blessing came upon her
[57:51] life.
[57:52] &gt;&gt; See, that's the difference between a
[57:53] real believer and a church member.
[57:55] Remember, brother Bam said, "Gesa was a
[57:56] lukewarm church member." He said, "See,
[57:58] he he he didn't see what Elisha saw. A
[58:01] church member never sees what a believer
[58:03] sees. Can I just lay that out there? I'm
[58:05] going to pastor that. We're going to
[58:06] have a church this morning. A church
[58:08] member can never see what a believer
[58:09] sees. A church member always sees a
[58:11] crisis. A church member always sees a
[58:13] problem. Every church member sees
[58:15] everything that's going on. They look at
[58:17] a sickness. They see symptoms. But a
[58:19] believer looks at the word of God. And
[58:20] the Bible says, "But the Bible said, by
[58:22] his stripes, I am healed." When a church
[58:25] member looks at a trial and said,
[58:26] "There's a mountain that I can't get
[58:28] over and I can't get around it and it's
[58:30] too great in my life and there's no way
[58:32] around." But a believer says, "But the
[58:34] Bible said in Isaiah the 40th chapter
[58:36] that every mountain shall be made a
[58:38] plain and the rough places shall be made
[58:40] a plain and I shall walk across. Let
[58:42] that every every believer takes the
[58:44] promise of the word of God." Oh friends,
[58:46] you can look at failure. You can look at
[58:48] the condemnation that comes in your
[58:50] heart. And as a church member, it'd make
[58:52] you be down today, up tomorrow. You
[58:54] wouldn't feel like coming to church next
[58:56] time because there's so much
[58:57] condemnation in your heart. But let me
[58:59] tell you what the Bible said. He says,
[59:00] "But if our heart condemn us, then God
[59:03] is greater than our heart and he knoweth
[59:06] all things."
[59:08] &gt;&gt; Yeah. How many are church members and
[59:09] how many are believers?
[59:11] &gt;&gt; See, a church member sees one thing, but
[59:13] a believer sees another. A believer sees
[59:15] beyond what a church member can see.
[59:17] That's why brother Bam said, "When you
[59:19] see the word of God, just embrace it.
[59:21] Come on.
[59:22] &gt;&gt; Just embrace it. Don't don't don't don't
[59:23] don't run from it. Embrace it." So when
[59:26] you hear, "I can do all things through
[59:28] Christ who gives me strength," just
[59:29] embrace it. When you say when you hear
[59:31] the Bible says, "Walk by faith and not
[59:33] by sight," I just embrace it. When he
[59:35] when he said, "I am the Lord thy God
[59:37] that health all thy diseases," I just
[59:39] embrace it.
[59:40] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[59:41] &gt;&gt; See, many today don't receive the
[59:42] promises of God. It's not from a lack of
[59:45] promise. No, sir.
[59:46] &gt;&gt; It's from a lack of faith.
[59:47] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[59:48] &gt;&gt; Can I say that?
[59:49] &gt;&gt; It's not from a lack of promise. Why
[59:51] don't we receive the promises of God? It
[59:53] ain't a lack of promise. It's a lack of
[59:55] faith. Why don't they get delivered?
[59:56] It's a lack of faith. Why don't they
[59:58] receive the Holy Ghost? It's a lack of
[1:00:00] faith. Why don't Why don't they receive
[1:00:02] their healing? It's a lack of faith.
[1:00:04] &gt;&gt; You say, "Well, Brother Matt, why is
[1:00:05] there a lack of faith?" Well, it's no
[1:00:07] there there's no faith because people
[1:00:10] fail to realize the source of their
[1:00:12] faith. Amen.
[1:00:13] &gt;&gt; See, if you have nowhere to go to get
[1:00:15] it,
[1:00:16] &gt;&gt; you run out.
[1:00:17] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:00:17] &gt;&gt; Isn't that right? If you if you if you
[1:00:19] if you ran out of bread and didn't know
[1:00:20] where to get bread, you said, "Well, we
[1:00:21] just don't have bread because nobody
[1:00:23] knows how to make it anymore. So, where
[1:00:25] do you go get it?"
[1:00:28] There's There's some that do. Thank
[1:00:29] y'all for teaching your children
[1:00:32] &gt;&gt; the tradesmen.
[1:00:34] &gt;&gt; Otherwise, we would all starve.
[1:00:37] &gt;&gt; But there has to be a source,
[1:00:39] &gt;&gt; a place to get it. Said, "Where does it
[1:00:41] come from?" Everybody knows this. Romans
[1:00:43] 20, the Bible says faith comes by
[1:00:44] hearing.
[1:00:46] &gt;&gt; How come many hear but they don't have
[1:00:47] faith?
[1:00:48] &gt;&gt; Church is filled with people,
[1:00:50] &gt;&gt; but they're bound up. They're
[1:00:52] &gt;&gt; they're not filled with the Holy Ghost.
[1:00:53] They lay in sickness. They don't receive
[1:00:55] healing. Their church is filled with
[1:00:57] people, but yet they hear the word, but
[1:00:59] yet they have no faith. But tell you
[1:01:00] what, the Bible says, they'd have ears,
[1:01:02] but hear not. In other words, they're
[1:01:03] not hearing with the right ear. They'd
[1:01:05] have eyes, but they see not. See this
[1:01:07] word hearing in Romans 20 comes from the
[1:01:09] Greek word aoe which means when properly
[1:01:12] used is speaking of a inner or a
[1:01:14] spiritual hearing.
[1:01:15] &gt;&gt; Come on.
[1:01:15] &gt;&gt; Just like in the heart it was speaking
[1:01:17] of a a spiritual place in a man's heart
[1:01:20] that he would see with open the eyes of
[1:01:22] my heart. Now Paul it speaks of our
[1:01:24] hearing. He said it's a inner or a
[1:01:26] spiritual hearing. And it goes with
[1:01:29] receiving faith from God. So in other
[1:01:30] words, when you read this Greek word
[1:01:32] aoe, it's actually speaking of your
[1:01:35] ability to discern God's voice.
[1:01:38] &gt;&gt; I think that's so powerful. This is what
[1:01:39] Paul's speaking of. Faith cometh by
[1:01:42] hearing. In other words, faith cometh by
[1:01:44] the ability to discern God's voice.
[1:01:47] &gt;&gt; See, there's many voices out there.
[1:01:49] There's many there's many things that we
[1:01:51] could hear, but Paul's telling us that
[1:01:52] there has to be there's an ability in
[1:01:54] us. There's a there's a spiritual
[1:01:56] hearing that we can discern the voice of
[1:01:57] God. This is the same word Paul used
[1:01:59] when he was speaking to the Galatians.
[1:02:00] He said, "Have you received the spirit
[1:02:02] by the works of the law or by the
[1:02:04] hearing of faith?"
[1:02:06] &gt;&gt; How did you receive the spirit? Was it
[1:02:07] by the works of the law? Is there
[1:02:09] something that you've done to receive
[1:02:10] the spirit of God or was it by the
[1:02:12] hearing of faith? Was you able to
[1:02:14] discern the voice of God? So here,
[1:02:16] listen what Paul's teaching us. First,
[1:02:18] we had to have a spiritual eye. And now
[1:02:20] he says we must have a spiritual ear. So
[1:02:22] unless you hear or see with those,
[1:02:25] you'll never have faith. You have to see
[1:02:26] with a spiritual eye. You must hear with
[1:02:28] a spiritual ear. And and when you hear
[1:02:31] and see in this way, then then comes
[1:02:33] faith in the promises of God. And don't
[1:02:36] you realize that today, friends, that's
[1:02:37] what the church has need of. We need
[1:02:39] faith. Somebody say, "We need faith." We
[1:02:42] need faith. That's what's depleted in
[1:02:43] the church. That's why that's what's
[1:02:45] depleted in the hearts of believers.
[1:02:47] It's a lack of faith. Everywhere you
[1:02:48] look, you see a lack of faith. Friends,
[1:02:50] I don't have to go very far to see a
[1:02:52] depleted faith. You can look at the
[1:02:54] church pew this morning and you see a
[1:02:56] people whose faith is constantly
[1:02:57] attacked by the world and constantly
[1:02:59] attacked by by letdowns and failures and
[1:03:03] and things that are going on around them
[1:03:04] that's constantly under attack is your
[1:03:07] faith. We need faith today. We need
[1:03:09] faith for our healing. We need faith for
[1:03:11] salvation. We need faith for
[1:03:12] deliverance. We need faith for a
[1:03:14] rapture. We need faith for those that
[1:03:16] lack faith. We need faith for others. We
[1:03:18] must have faith
[1:03:20] &gt;&gt; in the end time. That's what would be
[1:03:22] lacking is faith. That's why Jesus was
[1:03:24] concerned with it. Remember in Luke he
[1:03:26] asked he said when the son of man
[1:03:27] returns will I find what?
[1:03:30] &gt;&gt; Will I find faith says see will he find
[1:03:32] brother said see he never said will I
[1:03:34] find righteousness? Will I find a
[1:03:36] church? Will I find people? He said will
[1:03:38] I find faith? Somebody say faith.
[1:03:41] &gt;&gt; Will I find faith? This is what Jesus
[1:03:42] was concerned with here. Here here and I
[1:03:44] say that lightly the word concerned. But
[1:03:47] but will I find faith when I return?
[1:03:49] This was the challenge. Would there be
[1:03:50] faith in the end time? But the B said,
[1:03:52] see, so if he's going to return to the
[1:03:54] earth, will I find faith? He he's
[1:03:56] telling us where there's got to be
[1:03:58] somebody that was faith. He said, and so
[1:04:00] in the end time, there's got to be a
[1:04:03] great church full of faith. How many's a
[1:04:05] part of that church?
[1:04:06] &gt;&gt; He said, there's got to be a great
[1:04:08] church full of faith. That's why God
[1:04:10] sent these things down was to stimulate
[1:04:12] our faith. You want to know why God
[1:04:13] displayed the supernatural in this age?
[1:04:15] It was to stimulate faith. You know, you
[1:04:17] want to know why squirrels are created?
[1:04:19] It was to stimulate faith. You know why
[1:04:21] people were healed? It was to stimulate
[1:04:23] faith. You know, you know why you seen
[1:04:24] the supernatural and miracles and
[1:04:26] discernment by the thousands. It was to
[1:04:28] stimulate. It wasn't to build up a man.
[1:04:30] It wasn't to build up a following. It
[1:04:32] wasn't to create wealth or or to build
[1:04:34] up some tabernacle somewhere where a
[1:04:36] bunch of people could live off of it.
[1:04:37] The rest of it was to stimulate the
[1:04:39] faith of the bride of Jesus Christ. He
[1:04:41] said God sent these things down to
[1:04:44] stimulate our faith, to bring out faith,
[1:04:46] and to prove what faith is. That was the
[1:04:48] purpose of Malachi 4. Said it was to
[1:04:50] restore faith. It's no wonder whenever
[1:04:52] the prophet prophesied. He said,
[1:04:54] "Behold, I will send to you Elijah the
[1:04:57] prophet before the coming of the great
[1:04:59] and dreadful day of the Lord to turn the
[1:05:02] heart of the children." Isn't that
[1:05:04] something? He was to turn the heart.
[1:05:06] Now, we already know what this heart is
[1:05:08] he's talking about. It ain't the organ
[1:05:10] that's a heart. It ain't this flesh
[1:05:11] heart, but it's this spiritual seat
[1:05:13] that's sitting on the inside of a man,
[1:05:15] the throne room of God. It was to turn
[1:05:18] that heart back to God.
[1:05:20] &gt;&gt; To turn a heart from an intellect to a
[1:05:23] heart of faith.
[1:05:25] &gt;&gt; No. No. It was a spiritual place in your
[1:05:27] heart to turn it back to God. That was
[1:05:29] the fulfillment of Malachi 4, it was to
[1:05:32] bring faith. That's why that's why when
[1:05:33] you hear that's why when you hear the
[1:05:35] prophet speaking, it gives you faith.
[1:05:37] How many ever been down or been depleted
[1:05:39] and sit down listen to a tape? go ahead
[1:05:40] and be honest with me and sit down and
[1:05:42] listen to tape and all of a sudden your
[1:05:43] faith begins to restore and you hear
[1:05:45] something that's relevant to what you're
[1:05:47] what what's going on. Anybody else
[1:05:49] testify of that? I mean maybe going
[1:05:51] through some trial and just pick some uh
[1:05:52] some tape or something to listen to and
[1:05:54] put it on. Don't even know why you
[1:05:56] picked that one. But then right in the
[1:05:57] middle of it, God begins to speak to
[1:05:59] your heart and it starts to build your
[1:06:01] faith. Why is it building your faith?
[1:06:03] That was the promise of God of the
[1:06:05] ministry of Malachi 4 was to turn the
[1:06:08] heart
[1:06:09] &gt;&gt; back to what? back to faith. It was to
[1:06:11] turn it from an intellectual uh gospel
[1:06:13] to a to a gospel of faith so our heart
[1:06:16] would be able to receive the word by
[1:06:17] faith. Let me let me tell you what Jesus
[1:06:19] could have said. He could have just said
[1:06:20] it like this. He said he could have
[1:06:22] said, "Well, will I find a people that
[1:06:23] hear the word with a spiritual ear?" Cuz
[1:06:25] that's the people that have faith. Could
[1:06:27] I find a people that see with a
[1:06:29] spiritual eye and see beyond the natural
[1:06:31] and they look at the unseen? Cuz that's
[1:06:33] a people of faith. Can I find a people
[1:06:35] that looks at the word of God as an
[1:06:37] absolute and not everything that's going
[1:06:39] on around him, can I find a people like
[1:06:41] that? Cuz friends, let me tell you, when
[1:06:42] you show me a man that has a spiritual
[1:06:45] ear, or you show me a man that has a
[1:06:47] spiritual eye, then I'll show you a man
[1:06:49] that has faith.
[1:06:50] &gt;&gt; You show me somebody that hears with a
[1:06:53] spiritual ear. You show me somebody that
[1:06:55] sees things from a spiritual eye and not
[1:06:57] looking at it through the natural eye or
[1:06:59] circumstances or things that's going on
[1:07:01] around them. I'll show you a man that
[1:07:03] has faith.
[1:07:04] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:07:05] &gt;&gt; It's very noticeable when a man receives
[1:07:07] faith.
[1:07:08] &gt;&gt; How many know it's not a secret?
[1:07:10] &gt;&gt; It's noticeable. You remember Moses when
[1:07:12] he went out across the desert.
[1:07:14] &gt;&gt; He was fleeing. He was fleeing the
[1:07:16] Egyptians. He was afraid. You think
[1:07:18] about Moses here. What he had done is
[1:07:20] Moses had a zeal to do something for
[1:07:22] God.
[1:07:23] &gt;&gt; And because he had a zeal, he just
[1:07:24] jumped out there and punched the first
[1:07:26] guy he saw because his zeal after all,
[1:07:28] he was going to get he was going to
[1:07:29] correct everything in Egypt. So he had
[1:07:31] this zeal because he wanted to do
[1:07:33] something for God. And so here when he
[1:07:34] seen something that was wrong, he saw an
[1:07:36] Egyptian soldier whooping a Hebrew
[1:07:38] slave. He said, "I'm not going to let
[1:07:39] that spirit or I'm not let that person
[1:07:41] take a hold of them." So he just went
[1:07:42] out there and punched him. Took his
[1:07:44] life.
[1:07:45] &gt;&gt; And he found out really fast that that
[1:07:46] ain't what God had commissioned him to
[1:07:48] do.
[1:07:49] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:07:50] &gt;&gt; Said, "Well, I was going to get it all
[1:07:51] straightened out and corrected." And all
[1:07:53] of a sudden, now Moses is fleeing for
[1:07:55] his life out into the wilderness. He ran
[1:07:57] from the Egyptians. I thought, "Isn't it
[1:07:58] something here?" I you know I always
[1:08:00] thought imagine what Moses could have
[1:08:02] done with those 40 years that he wasted
[1:08:04] &gt;&gt; wandering around out in a wilderness
[1:08:07] hear that God needed him in Egypt but
[1:08:09] instead he was off in a wilderness
[1:08:11] somewhere because he didn't recognize
[1:08:12] the place that God had called him to. He
[1:08:14] had forgot he had a zeal he wanted to do
[1:08:16] what what God had brought him there for.
[1:08:19] You realize God placed him in Egypt. And
[1:08:21] here God when he brought him to this
[1:08:23] place now Moses is no it's so out of his
[1:08:25] place because because he's he's running
[1:08:27] from a running from the the calling that
[1:08:29] God had given him out of fear. He ran
[1:08:31] out in the wilderness lost all those
[1:08:33] years of his life. I thought Mike can
[1:08:34] you imagine if a man would just dedicate
[1:08:36] his life where he is to serve God where
[1:08:38] God put him and still looking for
[1:08:40] somewhere else to be if a man could ever
[1:08:42] come to that place. But Moses as he went
[1:08:44] off he was searching for an answer and
[1:08:45] he was searching for a place to hide.
[1:08:48] But thank God that God is merciful. And
[1:08:50] after all the wasted years and all the
[1:08:52] wasted time, still yet that when Moses
[1:08:54] got out there that on one day he saw the
[1:08:57] a bush that was burning up in the
[1:08:59] mountain and and the and the spirit of
[1:09:01] the Lord draw him up there to where God
[1:09:03] was and God began to reveal to him. I
[1:09:05] thought, isn't it something? But after
[1:09:07] he met God, then he had the faith to go
[1:09:09] down into Egypt and watch what happened
[1:09:11] to his life. He was a man without faith
[1:09:14] and he ran from his commission. But when
[1:09:16] he got a hold of the faith of the word
[1:09:18] of God, he went right back down to Egypt
[1:09:20] and stood in the face of Pharaoh, right
[1:09:22] back to where God had called him in the
[1:09:24] first place. Now he was a man in the
[1:09:26] line of duty. I I thought, isn't it
[1:09:28] something here? You can notice when a
[1:09:30] man finds faith here when he found this
[1:09:32] place, I thought here when Moses came to
[1:09:34] this place that God when he came to that
[1:09:36] mountain, he looked up there and there
[1:09:38] was a burning bush of fire. when you
[1:09:40] know what what God said when Moses
[1:09:41] walked up all of a sudden he walked into
[1:09:43] that that pillar of fire was burning but
[1:09:45] the bush was not consumed and Moses
[1:09:48] heard the voice of God speak out of the
[1:09:50] bush he said Moses take off your shoes
[1:09:53] for you're standing on holy ground I
[1:09:56] thought isn't it something that God made
[1:09:58] it a point to Moses to recognize the
[1:10:01] ground that he was standing on watch
[1:10:02] this as a I want to show you something
[1:10:04] here he said Moses take off your shoes
[1:10:07] for you're standing on holy ground. He
[1:10:10] wanted Moses to know where he was
[1:10:11] standing. You know, I thought this is a
[1:10:13] powerful thought. Do you realize that in
[1:10:15] the garden whenever God before there was
[1:10:17] ever a fall in the garden that God and
[1:10:20] man walked on the same ground? How many
[1:10:21] knows that? That's the Bible that man
[1:10:23] and God they walked in arm in arm and
[1:10:26] they they had communion one with
[1:10:27] another. Even even the Bible would say
[1:10:29] when they heard God walking, the Bible
[1:10:32] said they heard the voice of the Lord
[1:10:33] walking in the in the garden in the cool
[1:10:36] of day. So, so that that that God walked
[1:10:39] with man on the same grounds. I I
[1:10:41] thought, isn't that something? But then
[1:10:43] after the fall in the garden and death
[1:10:45] struck the earth. You notice what God
[1:10:48] done? Remember when God came down, he he
[1:10:50] took angels and he put them in the in
[1:10:52] the in the presence of the garden of
[1:10:53] Eden, the cherubams with flaming swords
[1:10:56] to block the way to the tree of life. So
[1:10:58] from that time, because of the fall in
[1:11:00] the garden, then man could not walk on
[1:11:03] those grounds with God that he used to
[1:11:05] walk on. Isn't that isn't that a sad
[1:11:07] picture here? One day they walked on the
[1:11:09] same ground. But then the next day a man
[1:11:11] couldn't walk on that ground again. And
[1:11:13] and you know from that time man was
[1:11:15] searching for grounds to meet God on.
[1:11:18] He's been searching for that place.
[1:11:20] Searching for a place of fellowship and
[1:11:22] searching for a place of communion. You
[1:11:23] know you know I I think of it like this.
[1:11:25] You know that that that that uh that you
[1:11:28] ever find uh two people that's in
[1:11:29] disagreement. You know that's what
[1:11:31] that's what you're always looking for. I
[1:11:33] you know I do a lot of mediating between
[1:11:35] between uh uh parties. I'll say it that
[1:11:37] way. A lot of mediating between people
[1:11:40] and and you know as a pastor there
[1:11:41] there's always something the devil's
[1:11:43] always trying to get in the middle of
[1:11:45] believers and husbands and wives and
[1:11:47] children and their parents and and
[1:11:49] church members to another. So Satan's
[1:11:51] always trying to get in the middle of
[1:11:53] it. But I've noticed as a mediator, as
[1:11:56] someone that would come and try to bring
[1:11:58] resolution uh to to a problem or a
[1:12:01] disagreement or a dispute, and I found
[1:12:02] this one thing is always true that you
[1:12:05] will never resolve a dispute if you
[1:12:07] can't find a common ground. So you have
[1:12:10] one that says, "I'm not going to budge
[1:12:11] here." And then you have the other one
[1:12:13] says, "Well, I'm not going to budge
[1:12:14] here." But there has to be somebody that
[1:12:16] can come in the middle. And when you're
[1:12:17] talking to somebody, I I don't care to
[1:12:19] tell you a trade secret, but when you're
[1:12:21] talking to somebody, you're looking for
[1:12:22] a common ground. And then you're talking
[1:12:24] to the other, you're looking for a
[1:12:26] common ground, a place that you can
[1:12:27] bring them together. Because if you
[1:12:29] never establish a a common ground, you
[1:12:31] will never have a resolution.
[1:12:33] &gt;&gt; So this is an this in every dispute
[1:12:35] there must be a common ground that you
[1:12:38] can come to that there can be a a
[1:12:40] resolution. And so, so here, you know, I
[1:12:42] got to think about this here that when
[1:12:44] Jesus a after this time that that the
[1:12:46] garden had had been had been blocked off
[1:12:49] that man has church for this place. Then
[1:12:51] when Jesus walked upon the earth, he
[1:12:53] came back and he walked up on the earth
[1:12:54] again. And the Bible says when he came
[1:12:56] to the earth, he spilled his own blood
[1:12:58] on it to redeem the earth. He was
[1:13:00] crucified. But you notice whenever he
[1:13:02] came, he was rejected by men. He was
[1:13:04] crucified. He was hung on the cross of
[1:13:06] Calvary. And then he resurrected. He
[1:13:08] ascended into glory. That's what John
[1:13:10] saw in a vision. Remember when John saw
[1:13:12] him? He said, "I saw him in heaven." You
[1:13:14] realize what he saw? He saw the corporal
[1:13:17] body of Jesus sitting on the throne of
[1:13:19] God. What was a man that walked in flesh
[1:13:22] upon this earth? John said, "I saw him
[1:13:24] when he sat upon the throne of God." I
[1:13:26] thought, "But isn't it something that
[1:13:28] here is corporal body was sitting on the
[1:13:30] throne of God?" But what did Jesus do?
[1:13:32] He sent his spirit down to inhabit the
[1:13:35] throne of every man's heart. He wasn't
[1:13:38] going to walk upon the earth and put his
[1:13:40] foot on the earth again. So he sent his
[1:13:42] spirit here. Jesus, oh glory to God.
[1:13:44] Here Jesus is sitting on the throne of
[1:13:47] God. And he sent his spirit or his life
[1:13:49] to sit on the throne of every heart that
[1:13:52] when you walked upon this earth, it was
[1:13:54] just as if he did.
[1:13:56] &gt;&gt; So see, he saw him sitting on the throne
[1:13:58] of the heart. See, but you notice after
[1:14:00] he ascended, you never see Jesus putting
[1:14:03] his foot back on this earth again. He
[1:14:05] never he never put his foot back on the
[1:14:07] earth again. Ma matter of fact you you
[1:14:08] can read that in the Bible. You ever you
[1:14:10] ever read about it in Revelations you
[1:14:12] know the first three chapters of
[1:14:13] Revelations is a are chapters to the
[1:14:16] church in the fourth chapter it the
[1:14:19] church goes up. Remember what the Bible
[1:14:20] said the door was open the revelations 4
[1:14:23] the door was opened in heaven. The voice
[1:14:25] which I heard come up hither I will show
[1:14:27] thee things that must be hereafter. So
[1:14:29] the fourth chapter, the church goes up
[1:14:31] and it doesn't return until the 19th
[1:14:32] chapter. And that's after the
[1:14:34] tribulation period when God calls out
[1:14:36] all the Jews. And when the church
[1:14:38] returns in the 19th chapter, notice how
[1:14:40] the Bible would say whenever the church
[1:14:42] will return, whenever they whenever
[1:14:43] Christ walks back on this earth again,
[1:14:46] they will walk out on what? On the ashes
[1:14:48] of the wicked. So this is after the
[1:14:51] tribulation, after after the judgment,
[1:14:53] after all this that happened upon the
[1:14:55] earth. So the church is going to go up
[1:14:57] and then after the tribulation after all
[1:15:00] this takes place then they'll come back
[1:15:02] and walk upon this earth again. I
[1:15:04] thought I thought isn't it something
[1:15:05] they will they they'll walk out. See
[1:15:07] before but before that G Jesus will
[1:15:10] never stand in his corpal body upon the
[1:15:12] earth until this earth has been purged
[1:15:14] over. He's not going to take us he's not
[1:15:16] going to take a step on it.
[1:15:17] &gt;&gt; That's right. So I thought is it
[1:15:19] something that in the garden there was
[1:15:21] he walked on the same ground with man
[1:15:23] but it was in the past. When Jesus was
[1:15:25] on the earth he walked on the same
[1:15:27] ground with man but it was in the past.
[1:15:30] And then one day there's coming a new
[1:15:32] Jerusalem. Whenever the Bible said Jesus
[1:15:34] will stand on Mount Olives again he'll
[1:15:36] stand on the same ground with man but
[1:15:38] it's in the future. So you know what
[1:15:40] that tells me is that you can't walk
[1:15:42] where he is and he can't walk where you
[1:15:44] are. You see what I'm saying here? here.
[1:15:46] He's in heaven in his corporal body. You
[1:15:48] can't walk up there on the grounds where
[1:15:50] Jesus sits. And neither will Jesus walk
[1:15:52] on the grounds that you walk on. So,
[1:15:54] what that tells me is in order for God
[1:15:56] and man to meet, then there has to be a
[1:15:58] common ground. If you can't go to where
[1:16:00] he Well, you may as well preach with me
[1:16:01] a minute, but if you can't go to where
[1:16:03] he is and he can't walk where you are,
[1:16:05] then where's the common ground? Brother
[1:16:07] Bam said the believer has a common
[1:16:09] ground, a place to meet God. He said,
[1:16:11] "And the believer and God meet together
[1:16:13] on the common ground of faith."
[1:16:16] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:16:16] &gt;&gt; See, faith is our common ground. It's
[1:16:18] what God gave you. It's a common ground
[1:16:21] between you and God. You may not be able
[1:16:23] to walk where his corporal body is. He
[1:16:25] may not be able to walk upon this earth
[1:16:27] and walk on the fields of this world. He
[1:16:29] said, "But God gave us a place to be
[1:16:31] able to meet God. And faith is our
[1:16:33] common ground between God and man."
[1:16:35] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Well friends, if I told you
[1:16:37] there was a place to meet God out there
[1:16:39] under a sycamore tree, you'd knock each
[1:16:41] other over trying to get to the sycamore
[1:16:43] tree to bring your petition before God.
[1:16:46] &gt;&gt; Every time you had trouble, you'd drive
[1:16:48] out to the to the woods to find the
[1:16:50] sycamore tree to say, "God, here I am
[1:16:52] again. Can you help me? I'm in need."
[1:16:55] &gt;&gt; If he was under a sycamore tree, and
[1:16:57] that was the grounds where you could
[1:16:58] meet God, you'd run out there to meet
[1:17:01] God because it's something you see with
[1:17:03] your natural eye. But here, brother Bam
[1:17:06] said, "But we have a common ground to
[1:17:08] meet God on. It's called faith." Don't
[1:17:10] you realize what's happening? The heart
[1:17:12] is being turned to a place of faith that
[1:17:14] you can be able to meet God wherever you
[1:17:16] are. You may be on a mountain, but God's
[1:17:18] in the mountain. You may be in the
[1:17:20] valley, but God's in the valley. You may
[1:17:22] be in the belly of a whale in the depths
[1:17:24] of the ocean, but God is in the whale's
[1:17:26] belly.
[1:17:27] &gt;&gt; Wherever you are, there God will be.
[1:17:31] &gt;&gt; Said it's common ground. Faith allows
[1:17:33] you to receive the spirit of God.
[1:17:35] &gt;&gt; It's faith that allows you to receive
[1:17:37] life. It's faith that allows you to
[1:17:39] receive deliverance. It's faith that
[1:17:40] gives you healing. It's faith that
[1:17:42] allows you to walk with God. But
[1:17:44] remember said when they left that tree
[1:17:45] of faith, they lost God.
[1:17:47] &gt;&gt; Man does not man does not know God by
[1:17:49] knowledge. He only knows God by faith.
[1:17:51] It's the only way that man can meet God
[1:17:53] is on the grounds of faith.
[1:17:55] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:17:55] &gt;&gt; If you believe, Jesus said, "It ain't if
[1:17:58] you get baptized such and such way, but
[1:18:00] if thou dost believe." Amen.
[1:18:02] &gt;&gt; And there's only one sin and that's the
[1:18:04] sin of unbelief. And each person in here
[1:18:07] tonight that you're either possessed
[1:18:08] with faith or you're possessed, my my
[1:18:10] what a thought.
[1:18:11] &gt;&gt; You're either possessed with faith.
[1:18:13] Either faith has a hold on you or you're
[1:18:15] possessed with unbelief. And your life
[1:18:17] proves what you are by the life that you
[1:18:20] live and the things that you do.
[1:18:21] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:18:22] &gt;&gt; Your outward life is an expression,
[1:18:24] &gt;&gt; amen,
[1:18:25] &gt;&gt; of what's going on on the inside.
[1:18:27] &gt;&gt; Who's inhabiting the throne of your
[1:18:29] heart?
[1:18:29] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:18:30] &gt;&gt; Who's on the throne of our heart? He
[1:18:31] said it's expressed on the outside.
[1:18:34] &gt;&gt; If it's either by faith or it's
[1:18:38] unbelief.
[1:18:38] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:18:39] &gt;&gt; But notice Moses after he received
[1:18:42] faith, then he stood on the grounds of
[1:18:44] faith.
[1:18:45] &gt;&gt; Brother Wesley, that's what took him
[1:18:46] into Egypt. You realize the grounds of
[1:18:48] faith was not the burning bush.
[1:18:50] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:18:50] &gt;&gt; You can go to that bush today. They have
[1:18:52] a monastery built around where they say
[1:18:54] was the bush or the ancestor of it is
[1:18:56] still there today. But you'll never find
[1:18:58] faith at the burning bush.
[1:19:00] You'll never the grounds of faith wasn't
[1:19:01] in the halls of Pharaoh where Moses
[1:19:03] stood and he threw the staff on the
[1:19:05] ground that would turn into a snake.
[1:19:07] That that was not where the grounds of
[1:19:08] faith, but the grounds can just say it.
[1:19:10] &gt;&gt; The grounds of faith is was everywhere
[1:19:12] that Moses put his foot.
[1:19:14] &gt;&gt; You know why? Because faith was
[1:19:15] inhabiting the throne of his heart. That
[1:19:17] means when he left the burning bush,
[1:19:19] brother David Paul, it was the grounds
[1:19:21] of faith. It didn't matter what
[1:19:22] wilderness he walked in. It was the
[1:19:24] grounds of faith. It didn't matter when
[1:19:25] he came to a Red Sea, he was standing on
[1:19:27] the grounds of faith. It didn't matter
[1:19:29] when he came before an enemy that said,
[1:19:30] "You can't go no farther and you can't
[1:19:32] pass through these lands." But Moses
[1:19:34] stood on the grounds of faith.
[1:19:36] Everywhere the soul of his foot ever
[1:19:38] step, it was the grounds of faith
[1:19:40] because faith was inhabiting the heart
[1:19:42] of a man.
[1:19:44] &gt;&gt; You can tell when a man gets to this
[1:19:45] place. Same thing happened with Peter.
[1:19:47] Can I just preach? Remember what
[1:19:49] happened with Peter? Peter was the man
[1:19:50] that Jesus said, "Before the crows,
[1:19:52] you'll deny me three times." And you
[1:19:54] notice what Peter done when they came
[1:19:55] around Peter when he had no faith. They
[1:19:58] said, "Aren't you one of his disciples?"
[1:20:00] Whose disciples? You know that Jesus? I
[1:20:02] don't even know who he is. Yeah, I
[1:20:04] thought I saw you down there at one of
[1:20:05] them meetings. You br you you you little
[1:20:08] Jesus follower. I saw you down there at
[1:20:09] one of them meetings. It wasn't that
[1:20:11] you. No, I I ain't one of them. I I
[1:20:13] don't know them people. Oh, I saw you
[1:20:15] down there at the dress shop trying on a
[1:20:17] new dress, trying to look like him. No,
[1:20:18] it wasn't me. I I ain't one of them.
[1:20:20] See, he would deny Christ three times.
[1:20:23] He denied Jesus. But you notice what
[1:20:26] happened whenever Peter's faith was
[1:20:28] restored.
[1:20:29] &gt;&gt; Then the Bible says him and John went
[1:20:30] down. There was a lame man sitting at
[1:20:32] the gate and they said, "Silver and gold
[1:20:34] have I none, but such as I have, I give
[1:20:36] unto thee in the name of Jesus,
[1:20:38] &gt;&gt; rise up and walk." A man that would deny
[1:20:41] even knowing Jesus, now he's walking
[1:20:43] around saying, "In the name of Jesus,
[1:20:46] rise up and in the name of Jesus, I give
[1:20:48] you your healing. In the name of Jesus,
[1:20:51] you'll find salvation. in the name of
[1:20:53] Jesus. A man that would deny knowing
[1:20:55] him.
[1:20:56] &gt;&gt; Then if they came up said, "How's this
[1:20:58] man?" They marveled at a man being
[1:21:00] healed. But you remember what Peter
[1:21:01] said? He said, "Why you marvel at this?
[1:21:03] It wasn't by my holiness that this man
[1:21:05] was made whole. It wasn't by the works
[1:21:07] that I done that this man was made
[1:21:08] whole. But let me tell you how the man
[1:21:10] was made whole is that God sent his son
[1:21:13] upon the earth and his name was Jesus
[1:21:15] Christ. And he died for our sins and our
[1:21:18] healing and by his stripes we received
[1:21:20] it." Praise God.
[1:21:21] &gt;&gt; So that's how this man, the same God of
[1:21:23] Abraham and the God of Isaac and the God
[1:21:25] of Jacob and the God of our fathers, he
[1:21:27] has glorified his son Jesus Christ. And
[1:21:30] you denied him in the presence of
[1:21:32] Pilate. And you went when when Pilate
[1:21:34] would have let him go. You denied the
[1:21:36] Holy One of Israel and you hung him on a
[1:21:38] cross. I thought, isn't it isn't it
[1:21:39] something that the man that was known
[1:21:41] would for denying Jesus was the same man
[1:21:44] that stood up on Solomon's porch and
[1:21:46] said, "You denied him and you denied him
[1:21:48] and you denied him before the presence
[1:21:50] of Pilate." Something had happened to
[1:21:52] his faith.
[1:21:54] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:21:55] &gt;&gt; He was known for denying. But when his
[1:21:57] when he got
[1:21:58] &gt;&gt; faith,
[1:22:00] &gt;&gt; then he went out and said, "You denied
[1:22:01] him.
[1:22:02] &gt;&gt; You denied him." I something. You killed
[1:22:05] the prince of life, but God raised him
[1:22:07] from the dead. He
[1:22:09] &gt;&gt; said, "And through faith in his name, he
[1:22:11] has made this man strong whom you see
[1:22:14] and know."
[1:22:16] &gt;&gt; So faith, Peter said, it gave this man
[1:22:20] perfect soundness because of of faith in
[1:22:24] Jesus's name.
[1:22:25] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:22:25] &gt;&gt; Isn't that powerful? Faith in Jesus
[1:22:28] brought perfect soundness.
[1:22:29] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:22:30] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[1:22:30] &gt;&gt; I don't know about y'all, but that that
[1:22:32] makes me want to have a runaway.
[1:22:33] It brings perfect soundness in your
[1:22:36] presence. This is he said, "Well, where
[1:22:37] was Peter's source of faith?" Can I tell
[1:22:39] you where it was?
[1:22:40] &gt;&gt; Before Peter said, before God has showed
[1:22:43] by the mouth of all his prophets the
[1:22:44] things Christ would suffer, he had so
[1:22:46] fulfilled.
[1:22:47] &gt;&gt; And that little scripture, you can see
[1:22:49] where Peter's source come from because
[1:22:51] he took the scripture and he saw how the
[1:22:53] scripture had been fulfilled and it gave
[1:22:56] Peter great faith.
[1:22:57] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:22:57] &gt;&gt; He said, "But God has already written
[1:22:59] this in the scripture. Now it's been
[1:23:00] revealed." See, see, so since it's been
[1:23:02] fulfilled, that's why that's why Peter
[1:23:04] had such faith. So the fulfillment of
[1:23:05] scripture causes faith. It gives you
[1:23:07] faith to overcome faith overcome fear
[1:23:10] with with courage, overcome anxiety and
[1:23:12] depression and worry, even denial.
[1:23:16] &gt;&gt; Faith can overcome all things. See,
[1:23:18] that's why we believe this message. It
[1:23:20] was the purpose of Malachi 4 was to do
[1:23:22] what? To restore faith.
[1:23:24] &gt;&gt; Can I preach for a minute?
[1:23:25] &gt;&gt; It was to restore faith. Now watch in
[1:23:27] Zechariah 14th chapter the Bible says
[1:23:29] and it shall come to pass in that day
[1:23:31] that the light shall not be clear nor
[1:23:33] dark. Now how many's read this here it's
[1:23:35] prophesying this day but but he said but
[1:23:37] it shall be one day which shall be known
[1:23:40] to the Lord not day nor night but it
[1:23:43] shall come to pass that at the evening
[1:23:45] time it shall be light. So here's
[1:23:47] Zachchariah tells of a day that is
[1:23:49] coming. It won't be day it won't be
[1:23:51] night. It won't be or it won't be clear.
[1:23:52] It won't be dark. said, "But in the
[1:23:54] evening time, at the ending of the day,
[1:23:56] there shall be light about the evening
[1:23:58] time." Brother Bram takes this this very
[1:24:00] scripture and he shows this as a time
[1:24:03] period since Jesus's earthly ministry.
[1:24:05] So he actually takes the full day and
[1:24:07] shows how that uh that that that the sun
[1:24:10] always rises in the east and it sets in
[1:24:12] the west. You see, so if the sun rises
[1:24:15] in the east and sets in the west, see,
[1:24:16] watch all things have done that very
[1:24:18] very same way civilization done it.
[1:24:20] Anybody ever studied uh uh geography?
[1:24:22] But civilization traveled with the sun.
[1:24:24] Since see remember in Eurasia whenever
[1:24:27] uh they had fertile agricultural land
[1:24:28] and there they had the the certain kind
[1:24:30] of crops that could be domesticated.
[1:24:32] They it was in the the the right river
[1:24:34] basins. They had the right kind of
[1:24:35] water. But civilization it moved from
[1:24:37] the east to the west. Even in the United
[1:24:39] States they came to the United States.
[1:24:41] They landed on the east coast and then
[1:24:42] they had an expansion eastward to rest
[1:24:45] westward. In the US it was called
[1:24:47] manifest destiny. remember that they
[1:24:48] were preaching that it was our destiny
[1:24:50] to go left and you know a lot of uh
[1:24:53] crazy things that that happened and all
[1:24:55] that but but the reality is is that it
[1:24:57] has always expanded from the east to the
[1:24:59] west but but said notice he said not
[1:25:01] only did civilization do that but so has
[1:25:03] the gospel the gospel started in the
[1:25:05] east it came all the way across to
[1:25:07] Germany to the Mediterranean from
[1:25:09] Germany to the English Channel to
[1:25:10] England across the Atlantic to the
[1:25:12] United States from the east coast now
[1:25:13] it's traveled all the way to the west
[1:25:14] coast and now the east and west has met
[1:25:17] again but The same sun that rose in the
[1:25:19] east is the same sun that set in the
[1:25:21] west. This is a powerful point. In other
[1:25:24] words, what that means is if the sun
[1:25:26] that rose over there is the same son
[1:25:28] that we see today, he said, "Then what
[1:25:30] about the sen, the son, the messiah is
[1:25:32] the one that rose on the eastern
[1:25:34] people." Whenever Jesus came to the
[1:25:36] earth 2,000 years ago, the sen, he rose
[1:25:39] in the east. He said, "And now since the
[1:25:42] time of Jesus, we've had a long day
[1:25:45] since his going away of denominations
[1:25:47] getting together. We we've had enough
[1:25:49] light just like a gloomy day when the
[1:25:52] sun is hid by clouds." So he takes this
[1:25:53] the this word of Zachchariah saying, "It
[1:25:56] shall not be clear, but it won't be
[1:25:58] dark." In other words, it's kind of a
[1:25:59] gloomy day, kind of a a dismal day.
[1:26:01] There's just there's just enough to get
[1:26:03] by on. He said, "And since the time of
[1:26:05] Christ, we've had this we've had this
[1:26:07] gloomy day when the sun has hit."
[1:26:08] They've had all kinds of denominations.
[1:26:10] We built hospitals. We built schools. We
[1:26:12] built organizations. We've did all these
[1:26:14] things just exactly the way we were
[1:26:16] supposed to do it. But Zachchariah
[1:26:18] promised, but in the evening time it
[1:26:21] shall be light. Isn't that something? So
[1:26:24] he said, so the same Jesus in his
[1:26:26] resurrected power that was rose in the
[1:26:29] east is the same Jesus that would rise
[1:26:31] in the west. So if we seen the gospel
[1:26:33] move from there all the way through this
[1:26:35] gleam gloomy and this dismal day but
[1:26:38] then there's going to come a time in the
[1:26:39] evening. Let me ask you friends, where
[1:26:41] is the sun in the evening time? It's
[1:26:43] made its way all the way westward a far
[1:26:45] as a man could go west before he wound
[1:26:47] up finding out that the earth wasn't
[1:26:49] flat. He's going to wind up right back
[1:26:50] where he started again. And before he
[1:26:52] ever found that out, he kept going west
[1:26:54] and kept going west and kept going west.
[1:26:56] He said, "But the same sun that rose in
[1:26:58] the east is the same sun that sets in
[1:27:01] the west. Amen.
[1:27:02] &gt;&gt; So, we done what we were supposed to do.
[1:27:04] But the same Jesus in his resurrected
[1:27:06] power will rise again. For he promised
[1:27:08] it in Malachi 4. He promised it in John
[1:27:10] 14. He promised in Luke 17. He said, "In
[1:27:13] the days of Sodom, so shall it be in the
[1:27:15] coming of the son of man." That's why in
[1:27:18] the evening time, you see, can I get a
[1:27:20] little bit more? In the evening time,
[1:27:22] that's why there's more recorded
[1:27:24] supernatural than than than there ever
[1:27:26] has been. That's why in the evening
[1:27:27] time, there's been more recorded
[1:27:29] miracles. That's why you've seen the
[1:27:30] supernatural more than and for the past
[1:27:33] 2,000 years, there's not books of of
[1:27:35] acts and things that went on in the
[1:27:37] church. But in the evening time, in this
[1:27:38] last stage, you see m uh many examples
[1:27:41] by the thousands of the supernatural.
[1:27:43] You say, "What's going on?" It's more
[1:27:45] examples of the display of the power of
[1:27:47] God. Say what's happening. It's the
[1:27:49] evening time, which is the resurrected
[1:27:51] power of Jesus being displayed in this
[1:27:53] hour. For Jesus said, "In the evening
[1:27:55] time, there would be light."
[1:27:57] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Amen.
[1:27:58] &gt;&gt; See, but the problem is
[1:28:01] &gt;&gt; in the days of Jesus with all the power
[1:28:04] of God manifested before them, they
[1:28:07] failed to see it as God.
[1:28:09] &gt;&gt; You notice this said they they saw the
[1:28:12] works but they failed to see him as God.
[1:28:13] You know what they called him? Be
[1:28:14] elabub.
[1:28:16] &gt;&gt; Remember whenever he healed the blind
[1:28:17] man at the pool of Salom when he came
[1:28:19] back they said you didn't do it on the
[1:28:20] right day. You must be a devil.
[1:28:22] &gt;&gt; I mean you healed a guy's eyes that
[1:28:24] didn't have eyes. You put clay in his
[1:28:25] sockets. They turned to eyeballs, but
[1:28:26] you must be a devil because you didn't
[1:28:28] do it on the right day
[1:28:29] &gt;&gt; to see of all the supernatural that was
[1:28:31] present before them. But the Pharisees
[1:28:34] saw it. He said, "Well, it must be a
[1:28:35] devil." They failed to see it as God.
[1:28:37] But notice, but around said, "But here
[1:28:39] we are. We're at a spot now." So if that
[1:28:41] was when the sun rose and it was the
[1:28:43] same sun and there was those around the
[1:28:45] world would fail to see it as God. Then
[1:28:46] what do you think they're going to do in
[1:28:48] the evening time when that light shines
[1:28:50] again? The whole world's going to flock
[1:28:52] to it and say, "Oh, isn't it God?"
[1:28:54] &gt;&gt; Well, no. Well, they certainly won't.
[1:28:55] They'll do the same thing they always
[1:28:57] did. And in the evening time, when
[1:28:59] there's light in the evening time, he
[1:29:01] said, "The Gentiles of that day failed
[1:29:02] to see it because it was hum in human
[1:29:04] flesh." He said, "And I wonder if we'll
[1:29:06] do the same thing that they did.
[1:29:08] &gt;&gt; I wonder if we'll make the sad mistake
[1:29:10] that they made and fail to know him
[1:29:13] &gt;&gt; because he was the word for that age."
[1:29:14] Oh, friends, let me tell you this. You
[1:29:16] can make a lot of mistakes in this life,
[1:29:17] but don't make that mistake.
[1:29:19] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:29:20] &gt;&gt; Don't make the mistake of failing to
[1:29:22] know him.
[1:29:23] &gt;&gt; Amen. So, I wonder if we make that sad
[1:29:25] mistake. Don't me don't make the mistake
[1:29:26] of failing to recognize him. I wonder
[1:29:28] how many would say that this morning. I
[1:29:30] want to know him. I want to know him in
[1:29:32] spirit. I I want to know him in power.
[1:29:34] You know, there's a lot of people that
[1:29:35] think they know him, but the reality is
[1:29:37] they don't. They know him by tradition.
[1:29:39] They know him by somebody's testimony.
[1:29:41] They they know him by church membership.
[1:29:43] They they they recite a repentance, go
[1:29:44] down to the water and receive baptism.
[1:29:47] And after all, if you go through all
[1:29:49] those rituals, they kind of say it like
[1:29:50] that. That's what they are. They're
[1:29:52] rituals. And after you go through all
[1:29:53] those rituals, then you think you're
[1:29:55] going to know him. But that ain't what
[1:29:56] makes you know him. Isn't that what Paul
[1:29:58] preached when he went to Philippi? He
[1:30:00] said, "Beware of dogs and evil workers.
[1:30:02] Beware of the concision." You know what
[1:30:04] Paul was talking about? Anybody want to
[1:30:05] know who he was calling dogs? He was
[1:30:07] talking about those that were telling
[1:30:09] people the things that they had to do to
[1:30:11] be saved.
[1:30:13] &gt;&gt; He said, "Beware of dogs that are among
[1:30:15] you." Paul called them dogs. People
[1:30:17] don't like that name no more, but they
[1:30:18] always want to talk about Jezebel and
[1:30:20] talk about dogs. But what about this
[1:30:22] Peter? Paul said, "Beware of dogs and
[1:30:24] evil workers." You know what he was
[1:30:25] talking about? He was talking about
[1:30:27] those that would follow after a law
[1:30:29] thinking it was going to bring
[1:30:30] salvation. If I can get you to do this,
[1:30:32] well, then you'll be saved. I can get
[1:30:33] you to look this way, then you'll be
[1:30:34] saved. Then everything will be all right
[1:30:36] with God. And that's how I know it. If I
[1:30:38] can just get you to follow. But none of
[1:30:39] that ever saved a man.
[1:30:40] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:30:41] &gt;&gt; You said, "Well, why would they teach
[1:30:42] that then?" Because it was a law.
[1:30:44] &gt;&gt; That's right. It was a it was a law
[1:30:45] right out of Genesis the 17th chapter
[1:30:47] whenever God spoke to Moses and he told
[1:30:49] them to obey the law of circumcision and
[1:30:51] it would be an identification of who was
[1:30:53] the children of God if they would be
[1:30:54] circumcised on the eighth day.
[1:30:56] &gt;&gt; It was a law of God. But whenever Paul
[1:31:00] began to preach about it, he said even
[1:31:02] though who it was, he said, "Look out
[1:31:04] for those dogs." Can I tell you? Can I
[1:31:06] read this out of an amplified Bible?
[1:31:08] &gt;&gt; I'm not trying to hurt feelings. I'm
[1:31:09] just trying to preach. Look out for
[1:31:11] those dogs, those Judaizers and
[1:31:13] legalists.
[1:31:15] &gt;&gt; Look out for those mischief makers. He
[1:31:16] called legalist mischief makers.
[1:31:18] &gt;&gt; Look out for those who mutilate the
[1:31:20] flesh
[1:31:21] &gt;&gt; because they were bound by the legalism
[1:31:23] of the law thinking that it was going to
[1:31:25] somehow bring salvation.
[1:31:27] &gt;&gt; He said, "But we as Christians, we are
[1:31:29] the true circumcision who worship God in
[1:31:31] spirit by the spirit of God. We exalt
[1:31:33] and glory and pride oursel in Jesus
[1:31:35] Christ. We put no confidence in our
[1:31:37] work." Somebody say, "No confidence. We
[1:31:40] put no confidence in our works. We don't
[1:31:42] depend on our flesh or our outward or
[1:31:44] physical advantage or external
[1:31:46] appearance. We put no confidence in
[1:31:47] those things.
[1:31:49] &gt;&gt; And then Paul goes to say, if anybody
[1:31:52] could, I could. Because nobody lived
[1:31:54] like Paul lived.
[1:31:55] &gt;&gt; He said, if anybody, he said, as for
[1:31:58] myself, at least I have grounds. Isn't
[1:32:01] this something?
[1:32:01] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:32:02] &gt;&gt; At least I have grounds to meet God on.
[1:32:04] Listen what Paul was saying. At least in
[1:32:06] my own self, at least I would have had
[1:32:08] grounds to meet God, to rely upon my
[1:32:10] flesh, because no man's ever done in his
[1:32:12] flesh like I did. Wouldn't I have the
[1:32:15] grounds to rely on my flesh? He said, if
[1:32:17] any man considers that he's done
[1:32:18] something or seems to have reason to
[1:32:20] rely on his flesh and his physical
[1:32:21] outward, he said, I have more than he
[1:32:23] does. Can I just read it? He said, I was
[1:32:25] circumcised when I was 8 days old. I'm
[1:32:27] of the race of Israel, of the tribe of
[1:32:29] Benjamin. I'm a Hebrew. I'm the son of a
[1:32:31] Hebrew. As to observing the law, I was
[1:32:33] of the party of Pharisees. I observed
[1:32:35] the law day and night from my birth. As
[1:32:37] to my zeal, I was a persecutor of the
[1:32:40] church, and by the law standard, I was
[1:32:42] righteous. I was proven to be blameless,
[1:32:44] and no fault was found in me. I obeyed
[1:32:46] the law to a tea. I followed the law to
[1:32:49] a tea. I even persecuted the church
[1:32:51] according to the law. In other words, my
[1:32:53] zeal, I'd take people's life. I had such
[1:32:55] a zeal, I'd cut them down if they had
[1:32:58] even o disobeyed the law of God. I set
[1:33:00] them straight.
[1:33:02] &gt;&gt; Nobody lived like Paul lived.
[1:33:04] &gt;&gt; He said, "Look, if anybody had grounds
[1:33:06] to rely on his flesh, I have grounds to
[1:33:08] rely on my flesh. If anybody does, no
[1:33:10] man has as much as me." He said, "But
[1:33:13] all those things which could have been a
[1:33:14] gain to me. Look at how I'm living,
[1:33:18] &gt;&gt; man. I It's a little quiet.
[1:33:21] &gt;&gt; Look at how I'm living. Ain't I doing so
[1:33:23] good? Ain't I an example to everybody
[1:33:25] else?"
[1:33:26] He says, "All those things which could
[1:33:28] have been a gain to me, I counted them
[1:33:30] all a loss."
[1:33:31] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:33:32] &gt;&gt; For Christ Jesus,
[1:33:34] &gt;&gt; for whom I have suffered the loss of all
[1:33:36] things, and I do count them but dung
[1:33:38] &gt;&gt; that I may win Christ.
[1:33:40] &gt;&gt; It ain't nothing but dung. It's all dung
[1:33:43] &gt;&gt; that I may win Christ. Paul had one
[1:33:45] purpose on his heart. It was that Jesus
[1:33:47] Christ would inhabit the throne of a
[1:33:49] man's heart.
[1:33:50] &gt;&gt; Cuz Paul knew something that people
[1:33:52] don't know today. He knew that if Jesus
[1:33:54] Christ ever got on the throne of a man's
[1:33:56] heart that he would take control of a
[1:33:58] man's life and you wouldn't have to
[1:33:59] control it any longer. That he would be
[1:34:01] on the he would be in the control tower.
[1:34:03] He would tell that man where to walk and
[1:34:05] he would tell that man how to step and
[1:34:07] how to live and how to dress and how to
[1:34:09] act and you wouldn't have to do it
[1:34:11] because Jesus Christ was inhabited in
[1:34:13] the throne of his heart.
[1:34:14] &gt;&gt; This is the message of Apostle Paul, the
[1:34:17] messenger to the gentile church. The
[1:34:19] apostle that brought the gospel to the
[1:34:20] Gentiles. He said, "If a man could ever
[1:34:23] get God on the throne of his heart, you
[1:34:25] don't have to rule over that man cuz
[1:34:27] he'll have a ruler and his name is Jesus
[1:34:29] Christ."
[1:34:31] &gt;&gt; That's the message of the hour.
[1:34:34] [Applause]
[1:34:37] &gt;&gt; Follow the letter to a tea.
[1:34:39] &gt;&gt; Brother said, "I hope we don't make the
[1:34:41] sad mistake that they did. Failed to
[1:34:43] know him."
[1:34:45] &gt;&gt; They follow the letter of the law to a
[1:34:46] tea, but they failed to know him.
[1:34:48] Friends, I don't know about you, but I
[1:34:50] don't want to know God like that.
[1:34:52] &gt;&gt; I want to know him in the fellowship.
[1:34:55] Paul said, in the fellowship of his
[1:34:56] suffering.
[1:34:58] &gt;&gt; I want to suffer the cause for Christ. I
[1:35:01] want to count all these things as as
[1:35:03] dung, all this stuff that I I've done to
[1:35:05] try to make myself look like somebody,
[1:35:07] look like a good church member. Let me
[1:35:09] just cast all that garbage aside and
[1:35:11] just get to a place where my heart can
[1:35:13] be open to have fellowship with God. Let
[1:35:15] me have communion with God. Let me walk
[1:35:17] with him and him walk with me. Friends,
[1:35:19] if you want to help somebody, that's the
[1:35:21] way you help them. Help them get to a
[1:35:23] place where God can inhabit the throne
[1:35:24] of their heart.
[1:35:26] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:35:27] &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord.
[1:35:28] &gt;&gt; Get to a place where the Holy Ghost can
[1:35:30] rule over their life. Paul said, "I
[1:35:32] count it. I want to know him in
[1:35:34] fellowship, even unto my death. Let me
[1:35:37] suffer the cause of Christ. I want to
[1:35:39] know him in the power of his
[1:35:41] resurrection." He said, 'I want to be
[1:35:43] found in him, not having my own
[1:35:44] righteousness which is of the law, but I
[1:35:47] want to be found with righteousness
[1:35:49] which is through faith of Jesus Christ,
[1:35:52] the righteousness which is of God by
[1:35:54] faith that I may know him and the power
[1:35:57] of his resurrection. You hear what Paul
[1:35:59] said?
[1:36:00] &gt;&gt; You hear what he said? How many accepts
[1:36:01] Paul as a messenger?
[1:36:03] &gt;&gt; How many accepts him this word as an
[1:36:05] authority over your life?
[1:36:07] &gt;&gt; Re said, don't don't rebuke it now.
[1:36:09] Embrace it. He
[1:36:10] &gt;&gt; said, "I don't want to know him by the
[1:36:14] law which or the right I don't want to
[1:36:16] have righteousness of my own by the law,
[1:36:17] but which is of faith through Christ.
[1:36:20] The righteousness which is of God by
[1:36:22] faith that I may know him." Paul tells
[1:36:24] us that the only way to know him and
[1:36:26] experience the power of his resurrection
[1:36:29] is to know God through faith of Christ.
[1:36:33] &gt;&gt; Not through faith in our law or our own
[1:36:36] righteousness, but it's through faith in
[1:36:37] Christ. He said, "And the fellowship of
[1:36:39] his servants, be conformable to his
[1:36:41] death." I wonder, but man said, "I
[1:36:42] wonder if we'll make the sad mistake
[1:36:43] they did and fail to know him. Follow
[1:36:46] the letter of the law." Can you imagine
[1:36:49] living your whole life and living a a
[1:36:52] legalistic life and following the letter
[1:36:54] of a law to a tea, but you fail to know
[1:36:56] him.
[1:36:57] &gt;&gt; You fail to have the heart that God had.
[1:36:59] You fail to have the heart that the
[1:37:01] prophet had whenever he was a prophet
[1:37:03] and he put things on tape because he was
[1:37:05] a prophet and he had that's why he
[1:37:06] preached for two hours. He said, "Well,
[1:37:08] I got to lay this on tape." It wasn't so
[1:37:09] all of us go copy after him because he
[1:37:11] said that wasn't the most effective way
[1:37:13] to evangelize. But but but he done it to
[1:37:15] lay it on tape, but we would have the
[1:37:16] food, spiritual food in due season.
[1:37:19] &gt;&gt; Said he was he was a prophet of God. He
[1:37:21] laid that on tape. He said, "But but but
[1:37:23] in order to know him, what we don't we
[1:37:25] want we don't want to know him by law.
[1:37:27] We don't want to know him by taking that
[1:37:28] and and and make it taking some
[1:37:30] legalistic view of of the message and
[1:37:33] trying to hold it over people's life."
[1:37:34] He said, "What good would it do I to
[1:37:36] know him that way?" Don't make a mistake
[1:37:39] like they did and fail to know him.
[1:37:42] &gt;&gt; But I want to know him.
[1:37:43] &gt;&gt; I want my heart to be turned that I
[1:37:45] wonder how many you young people would
[1:37:47] say that this morning. I want my heart
[1:37:48] to be open that Christ can sit on the
[1:37:50] throne of my heart. I want him to to
[1:37:52] have the control. You realize it's a
[1:37:54] Bible promise. The Bible said, "But in
[1:37:56] that day it shall be known to the Lord,
[1:37:58] not day nor night, but it shall come to
[1:38:00] pass that at the evening time it shall
[1:38:03] be light."
[1:38:05] &gt;&gt; Can I take Can I have just a minute?
[1:38:07] It's a Somebody slap the person next to
[1:38:09] you and tell them, give them just
[1:38:10] another minute just to keep them all
[1:38:12] awake. In the evening time, it shall be
[1:38:14] light. Let me let me show you something.
[1:38:15] You know, this day that G that the Bible
[1:38:17] was talking about, Zechariah was talking
[1:38:19] about, Brother Cody, this day is not
[1:38:20] speaking of the millennium. It's not
[1:38:22] speaking of of the new Jerusalem. It
[1:38:24] ain't speaking of heaven. Then why why
[1:38:26] would it be talking about I've heard
[1:38:27] people say that. Well, in the evening
[1:38:28] time it shall be light. Well, that's
[1:38:30] whenever Jesus is going to come down on
[1:38:31] the earth. Well, that don't even make
[1:38:32] any sense because the Bible said the new
[1:38:34] Jerusalem, it that city would not even
[1:38:36] need light because the lamb would be the
[1:38:38] light of the city. It wouldn't need a
[1:38:40] sun. It wouldn't need a moon. So, it
[1:38:42] couldn't have been talking about the new
[1:38:43] Jerusalem. He said, "But the evening
[1:38:45] time, in that day, the evening time, it
[1:38:47] shall be light." About the evening time,
[1:38:49] you say, "What was it?" See, if you look
[1:38:50] at the church from the time of Jesus
[1:38:53] until now, you realize that this was one
[1:38:55] long day down through time and and
[1:38:57] brother said, "See, but in the evening
[1:38:59] time, this long day, it shall be light."
[1:39:01] Well, what is light? Light is a
[1:39:02] revelation. So, it's the in the evening
[1:39:05] time there would come an evening time
[1:39:06] revelation that would reveal the word of
[1:39:09] God to to do what? The revealing of the
[1:39:11] word is what would put faith in the
[1:39:13] hearts. It's what would turn our hearts
[1:39:15] back to God and put faith back in our
[1:39:17] heart again. says, "See, so the evening
[1:39:18] time, he promised he would reveal he
[1:39:20] would open the seven seals and show the
[1:39:22] churches what they missed back there."
[1:39:24] So, you know what that tells me? It
[1:39:25] tells me that the evening time is a time
[1:39:28] of faith. It's a time of revelation. It
[1:39:30] It's a time of rejoicing. It's a time of
[1:39:32] jubilee. The evening time, Brother
[1:39:34] Brian, it's a time of revival. It's a
[1:39:36] It's a time of the church being
[1:39:37] established again. It's a time that the
[1:39:39] power of God would come back to the
[1:39:41] church of the living God. It's a time of
[1:39:43] jubilee. It's a It's a time of freedom.
[1:39:45] It's a time of rejuvenation. It it's a
[1:39:47] time of the church being restored back
[1:39:49] in power. And this evening light is what
[1:39:52] opens the eyes of the blind church
[1:39:55] that's been blind through this dismal
[1:39:57] day that's been blind through this
[1:39:58] gloomy day. And let me tell you what
[1:40:00] happens when the eyes of the church
[1:40:02] opens. It causes a steering among the
[1:40:04] church of the living God. You say, "What
[1:40:06] brought the message or the revival in
[1:40:08] the message of the hour?" It's because
[1:40:10] the eyes of the blind have become open
[1:40:13] and there's a steering in their heart.
[1:40:15] Can I say this? Every time the eyes of
[1:40:17] one is open, it always brings a revival.
[1:40:20] When the word of God is revealed to a
[1:40:21] human heart, it puts a revival in there.
[1:40:23] That's how I know if God's word's been
[1:40:25] open to a person's heart or not, cuz
[1:40:27] there's a revival in there. If their
[1:40:29] heart's been if the word has been
[1:40:30] revealed. Every time the word's
[1:40:32] revealed, it puts revival. You remember
[1:40:34] the two men on the road to Emmas? They
[1:40:36] were walking along. What a sad day it
[1:40:38] is. Why? It had been a long dark or a
[1:40:41] long gloomy and dismal day. What a sad
[1:40:43] day it is for the Messiah has done gone.
[1:40:46] And that Jesus said, "We follow." They
[1:40:48] hung him on a cross. What a gloomy day
[1:40:50] that it was. But then Jesus stepped out
[1:40:52] of the the wayside, he said, "What
[1:40:54] manner of communications are these?" And
[1:40:56] the Bible says as they walked along, you
[1:40:59] know what they said to him? They said,
[1:41:00] "Well, it's about the evening time, so
[1:41:03] why don't you abide with us?" And the
[1:41:04] Bible said, "So at the evening time, he
[1:41:06] went and he sat down at their table and
[1:41:08] he began to talk to them. And the Bible
[1:41:10] said he expounded to them from the book
[1:41:12] of Moses how the things must be, how it
[1:41:15] would come to this place. And when he
[1:41:17] sat down at the table, he broke open
[1:41:19] bread. And the Bible said when he broke
[1:41:21] open the bread, their eyes became open.
[1:41:23] Well, you know what it done? It put a
[1:41:25] revival in their heart. They went
[1:41:27] dancing down the road looking for
[1:41:29] somebody to tell. There's light in the
[1:41:31] evening time. We had a long day. It was
[1:41:34] a dismal day. It was a gloomy day. But
[1:41:36] in the evening time, my eyes was open to
[1:41:39] the revealing of the word of God and I
[1:41:41] saw him in the power of his
[1:41:43] resurrection.
[1:41:46] &gt;&gt; It opened the eyes and it started
[1:41:48] revival.
[1:41:49] &gt;&gt; See, so if there's a light in the
[1:41:50] evening time, but let me ask you this.
[1:41:52] What's the rest of the day look like?
[1:44:02] used to break bread. That's how I
[1:44:03] recognized it was him. He discerned her
[1:44:05] heart like he discerned the woman at the
[1:44:07] well. That's how I recognized it to be
[1:44:09] him. He healed them like he healed them
[1:44:11] down there at the pool of Bethesda. And
[1:44:13] he opened the eyes of the blind. That's
[1:44:15] how I recognized it to be him. And I
[1:44:17] looked past the flesh of a man and I saw
[1:44:19] the God that was in the heart of the the
[1:44:21] throne of the heart of a man and I saw
[1:44:23] God moving in human flesh.
[1:44:26] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:44:27] &gt;&gt; You see, I saw him again. The revelation
[1:44:30] of the message. You see what it is? It's
[1:44:33] the light of the age.
[1:44:34] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[1:44:35] &gt;&gt; It was the opening of the word became
[1:44:36] the light of the age. The breaking of
[1:44:38] bread. That's why when brother B went
[1:44:40] through and he began to show us who we
[1:44:42] are and show it, something struck your
[1:44:44] heart. It was what is it? It was a
[1:44:46] revelation. You know, nobody can teach
[1:44:48] you that. You can teach, you can
[1:44:50] memorize every bit of that and never do
[1:44:51] you a lick of good. You You can have the
[1:44:53] best theologian in the world. It'll
[1:44:54] never do you a lick of good. All it
[1:44:56] takes a still it takes a still small
[1:44:58] voice to open the heart of a person say
[1:45:00] that is me
[1:45:01] &gt;&gt; to accept that and say that ain't
[1:45:02] nothing but the truth like Hattie Wright
[1:45:04] did. What made her say that? It was
[1:45:06] something in her
[1:45:07] &gt;&gt; that identified who she was.
[1:45:10] &gt;&gt; See, so the revelation of the message
[1:45:12] that lights the pathway to redemption.
[1:45:15] Isn't that what brother Bam said? He
[1:45:16] said the purpose of the message was
[1:45:17] what? Redemption.
[1:45:19] &gt;&gt; The purpose of the message was
[1:45:20] redemption. So in other words, the
[1:45:22] revelation of the message, it's what
[1:45:24] lights the path
[1:45:26] &gt;&gt; for you to find redemption.
[1:45:28] &gt;&gt; It's lighting our path. You know, in
[1:45:29] other words, it's our it's what lights
[1:45:31] the path for you to find grace. It's
[1:45:34] where you find healing. It's where you
[1:45:36] find salvation. It's what you turn to
[1:45:38] when you're lost. It's where you go when
[1:45:39] you're afraid and you need an answer.
[1:45:41] That's where you run to. It's the place
[1:45:42] that you cast your burdens. Don't worry.
[1:45:44] I know what people say. Well, brother,
[1:45:46] I'll tell you why. That all those things
[1:45:48] you should do to Christ. Well, that's
[1:45:50] that's good, Mr. Denomination. But where
[1:45:53] is he?
[1:45:55] I'll cast my burdens on Christ. Well,
[1:45:57] good. Where is he? I I'll just run to
[1:46:00] Christ. That's good. Where is he? I'll I
[1:46:03] I I'll just lay at at the at the foot of
[1:46:05] the cross. Good. Where is the foot of
[1:46:07] the cross?
[1:46:08] &gt;&gt; Where is Christ? The Bible says the word
[1:46:11] was God and the word and and the word
[1:46:13] became flesh
[1:46:14] &gt;&gt; and dwelt among us. You want me tell you
[1:46:16] where he is? He is his word.
[1:46:18] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:46:18] &gt;&gt; So the revealing of the word is the only
[1:46:20] place you'll ever find Christ is in the
[1:46:21] word. You see why this message is
[1:46:23] important? It ain't running out in the
[1:46:25] woods somewhere and finding some magical
[1:46:27] place and looking for this great spirit.
[1:46:28] God, it's by the word that you will find
[1:46:30] Christ. By the preaching of the word,
[1:46:33] it's by hearing of the word of God.
[1:46:35] That's the only thing that'll ever turn
[1:46:36] your heart. That's the only thing that
[1:46:38] will ever open that throne room to allow
[1:46:40] God to come in. That's the only thing
[1:46:42] that'll ever fulfill Ephesians 1:18 that
[1:46:44] the eyes of your heart would be open. It
[1:46:46] would take a revealing of the word of
[1:46:48] God
[1:46:49] &gt;&gt; or the message of the hour. Where is
[1:46:51] God? It's Christ in his word today.
[1:46:54] &gt;&gt; It's God's provided way of redemption.
[1:46:57] You realize faith in God's word. It
[1:47:01] becomes a pathway to redemption.
[1:47:03] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:47:04] &gt;&gt; This is what the Bible said. In the
[1:47:05] evening time there shall be light.
[1:47:08] &gt;&gt; Can I as a music players want to come?
[1:47:10] In the evening time there shall be
[1:47:12] light.
[1:47:15] &gt;&gt; Genesis 3 and8
[1:47:18] the Bible says and they heard the voice.
[1:47:20] You ever noticed this? When it was and
[1:47:22] they heard the voice of the Lord God
[1:47:24] walking in the garden in the cool of the
[1:47:27] day.
[1:47:28] &gt;&gt; You know how many knows when the cool of
[1:47:30] the day was in the in the Hebrew? I
[1:47:33] always thought this was quite a paradox
[1:47:35] that in the garden of Eden there was a
[1:47:36] cool of the day but it had this perfect
[1:47:38] temperature but just something I think
[1:47:41] like but in the cool of the day in the
[1:47:43] evening time over in the eastern at the
[1:47:46] end of the day in those hot deserts and
[1:47:47] summers and then in the evening time the
[1:47:49] the wind would come through and and it
[1:47:52] would kind of blow across there and the
[1:47:54] temperature would drop about 15 20
[1:47:56] degrees and then people sit out and
[1:47:58] enjoy and have communion and fellowship.
[1:48:00] This is when God would come and have
[1:48:02] fellowship with Adam in the evening
[1:48:05] time, in the cool of the day, in that
[1:48:07] evening breeze.
[1:48:10] The Bible says Adam and Eve, they heard
[1:48:12] the voice of the Lord God walking in the
[1:48:14] garden in the cool of the day.
[1:48:17] You realize the Bible said after they
[1:48:19] heard that, they went and they hid
[1:48:21] themselves.
[1:48:24] They were so afraid many days that they
[1:48:27] had heard the voice of God walking in
[1:48:30] the cool of the day. But this day
[1:48:33] something had changed.
[1:48:35] See, because
[1:48:38] it had been a long day, Brother Brian,
[1:48:42] the Bible said, "The day you eat that of
[1:48:44] that tree, you shall surely die."
[1:48:46] Remember what Satan came and told Eve?
[1:48:48] No, that the day you eat of this tree,
[1:48:50] you'll know like God knows.
[1:48:52] &gt;&gt; It had been a long day.
[1:48:54] The serpent had begiled Eve. She took
[1:48:57] the that what she had received of the
[1:49:00] serpent and she took it to Adam. There
[1:49:03] had been this great fall. Abraham says,
[1:49:05] "See what happened? Now think they they
[1:49:08] recognized their sin and now it was a
[1:49:10] cloudy day." They never had a cloudy
[1:49:12] day. They never had a gloomy day. But in
[1:49:14] that day, it was a long day.
[1:49:19] all the trial and all the sin and all
[1:49:22] the condemnation that was in their life
[1:49:25] because of their fall.
[1:49:27] It was so much that whenever they heard
[1:49:29] God after all the maybe a million years
[1:49:31] that God had walked in that garden,
[1:49:33] maybe a billion years, I don't know,
[1:49:36] that God had walked in the garden with
[1:49:38] them day after day after day.
[1:49:41] But this day, Brother Wesley, at the end
[1:49:43] of all this, they hid from God.
[1:49:47] It was a gloomy day. The sin had caused
[1:49:51] them to to hide. But remember said,
[1:49:54] "See, think of it. That's the way it is
[1:49:57] with us." At the end of that gloomy day,
[1:50:00] the church had failed. They had failed
[1:50:01] to meet God. They they read about the
[1:50:04] book of Acts, but because they couldn't
[1:50:05] manifer or produce it, they said, "Well,
[1:50:07] it had to be for some other day." They
[1:50:09] just gave up that it was even their
[1:50:10] promise because nobody in their church
[1:50:12] could lay hands on the sick and they
[1:50:13] were covered. No, they hadn't seen
[1:50:15] miracles performed. So it must not even
[1:50:17] be for this age anymore. So they put it
[1:50:19] back in another day. Just a gloomy day.
[1:50:22] Condemnation keeping them from being
[1:50:24] able to receive the promises of God.
[1:50:26] They gone they gotten so far. He said,
[1:50:29] "But in that in that day, Adam in the
[1:50:32] Garden of Eden," he said, "See, when he
[1:50:34] first sinned, God had a way of
[1:50:36] redemption for him." Can I read this to
[1:50:38] you?
[1:50:39] &gt;&gt; He said, "God had a way of redemption
[1:50:41] for him right quick."
[1:50:44] &gt;&gt; Isn't that powerful? In the same day
[1:50:46] that he was supposed to die, in the same
[1:50:48] day that he sinned, he said, "But God
[1:50:50] had a way of redemption for him right
[1:50:52] quick."
[1:50:54] &gt;&gt; Just as soon as he sinned, God made a
[1:50:56] way of redemption.
[1:50:58] He said, "And Adam, before he could ever
[1:51:00] approach back to fellowship with the
[1:51:01] father, God had to slay an innocent lamb
[1:51:03] or a sheep to make him a cloth to go
[1:51:05] around him." He said, "But when God done
[1:51:07] it, he threw out a welcome carpet for
[1:51:09] Adam to walk back on the carpet of
[1:51:12] redemption back into the presence of God
[1:51:15] again." My is that powerful this
[1:51:17] morning. You notice what God was doing?
[1:51:18] He was making a way that Adam, he he
[1:51:21] threw out a welcome carpet. He threw a
[1:51:23] carpet. Oh, friends, there there's all
[1:51:25] kinds of carpet you could walk on. I I
[1:51:27] know the wealth and the fame, they want
[1:51:28] to walk down a red carpet. But friends,
[1:51:29] if there's ever a red carpet you could
[1:51:31] walk on this morning, it's the red
[1:51:33] carpet of redemption that God has thrown
[1:51:35] out
[1:51:36] &gt;&gt; in the evening time in the end of the
[1:51:38] day whenever death was supposed to
[1:51:40] strike his life. But right in the cool
[1:51:42] of the evening, God showed up and he
[1:51:45] laid out a carpet of redemption and
[1:51:47] said, "Adam, I'm giving you a way to
[1:51:49] walk back into fellowship with God."
[1:51:51] What was it? It was grounds to meet God
[1:51:53] on.
[1:51:54] &gt;&gt; In the evening time, there shall be
[1:51:56] light.
[1:51:58] that God would come down and slay a
[1:52:01] lamb. He said he could come back in the
[1:52:03] presence of God again. God's always had
[1:52:05] a plan of redemption. It's through the
[1:52:07] blood. Ever since there was in the very
[1:52:09] beginning, the dawn of time and
[1:52:10] perceived in the mind of God before the
[1:52:12] world would ever come to existence. Adam
[1:52:14] and Eve there, our first father and
[1:52:16] mother, they started to walk out of the
[1:52:17] garden and this old cloudy sin hanging
[1:52:19] over their brows, clouds of darkness
[1:52:22] hanging around them. They had received
[1:52:23] their word of their eternal destination.
[1:52:26] What a gloomy day that it was. They
[1:52:28] walked out with these bloody sheep
[1:52:30] skkins around them. He said, "But thank
[1:52:32] God they had some little ray of hope."
[1:52:36] Ain't that powerful? In the middle of
[1:52:38] this gloomy day, in the this long,
[1:52:40] dismal and gloomy day when it looked
[1:52:42] like all hope was lost, he said, "But
[1:52:44] they had a little ray of hope." And that
[1:52:46] hope was the word that God had spoke
[1:52:49] over them. They heard the word of God in
[1:52:51] the garden. He said, "But I, thy seed
[1:52:54] will put his foot. I will bring enmity
[1:52:56] between your seat and the serpent seat.
[1:52:58] He will stand. His foot shall be upon
[1:53:00] his head. See, they had a promise of the
[1:53:02] word of God. Even in the middle of their
[1:53:04] sin, in the middle of their gloom, their
[1:53:07] little ray of hope was a promise that
[1:53:09] God had made that in the evening time
[1:53:12] there shall be light.
[1:53:14] &gt;&gt; There coming a day when your sheep will
[1:53:17] rule over that serpent. The one that
[1:53:19] took you down, the one that begiled you,
[1:53:21] the one that ruled over you. But their
[1:53:23] ray of hope was a promise of the word of
[1:53:26] God
[1:53:27] &gt;&gt; that one day I'll put him in his place.
[1:53:29] &gt;&gt; Now, don't you realize friends that ray
[1:53:31] of hope of the day of Jesus or in the
[1:53:34] day of Adam, it was a ray of hope. But
[1:53:36] when it come to the end of this great
[1:53:38] day, it's not just a ray of light. It's
[1:53:40] a great light that has been open to us.
[1:53:42] The devil has been exposed and power has
[1:53:45] been returned to the church of the
[1:53:47] living God. Won't you stand to your feet
[1:53:49] this morning? He said at the very
[1:53:52] beginning,
[1:53:53] he said, you think about it. People
[1:53:55] quote Psalms, they say, "Though I walk
[1:53:57] through the the the dark valleys of the
[1:53:59] shadow of death." He said, "That ain't
[1:54:00] the way the Bible reads. It ain't a dark
[1:54:02] valley. It's just a valley
[1:54:04] &gt;&gt; of the shadow of death." He said, "It
[1:54:06] ain't dark at all. Matter of fact, even
[1:54:07] in death, there's still light."
[1:54:09] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:54:10] &gt;&gt; Said, "How can there be a shadow if
[1:54:11] there is no light?" There's no shadow in
[1:54:13] darkness.
[1:54:13] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:54:14] &gt;&gt; He said, "So, even the own scripture
[1:54:15] proves that the worst that could happen
[1:54:17] was death, but even in death, there's
[1:54:19] still light. Amen.
[1:54:20] &gt;&gt; Isn't that powerful? And through the
[1:54:22] valley of the shadow of death, he said
[1:54:24] there never there never has been from
[1:54:26] the very beginning. It never had been
[1:54:28] complete darkness. It was a shadow since
[1:54:30] God said, "Let there be light." Isn't
[1:54:32] that powerful? Since the time God said,
[1:54:35] "Let there be light." There has never
[1:54:36] been total darkness.
[1:54:39] Isn't that wonderful? There's never been
[1:54:41] total darkness. There's always been a
[1:54:43] little bit of dismal, a little ray of
[1:54:47] hope.
[1:54:49] I wonder how many in this day can see
[1:54:53] the light of God. Maybe you raise your
[1:54:55] hand, say, "Brother man, I I've seen
[1:54:57] that great light as it's shined upon the
[1:54:59] word of God."
[1:55:01] &gt;&gt; And you know what it does every time we
[1:55:03] come in the house of God. You realize
[1:55:05] that's the atmosphere that you're
[1:55:07] standing in this morning. It's the
[1:55:09] presence of that great light.
[1:55:11] &gt;&gt; Come on, Gahhesa. You don't have to see
[1:55:13] it with your natural eye.
[1:55:15] &gt;&gt; We're not a bunch of lukewarm church
[1:55:16] members. We're believers. You said you
[1:55:18] believers.
[1:55:18] &gt;&gt; Amen. See, see, so when we come
[1:55:20] together, he said that same pillar of
[1:55:21] fire is here this morning. And he's
[1:55:23] discerning the hearts of the church,
[1:55:26] &gt;&gt; discerning the thoughts and the intents
[1:55:27] of our heart. And God come this morning,
[1:55:30] every time we come in the house of God,
[1:55:31] and he takes his word and he begins to
[1:55:33] speak to our heart. What is he doing?
[1:55:35] He's trying to bring us further down the
[1:55:36] road. He's trying to give us a little
[1:55:38] bit more revelation. He's trying to
[1:55:40] bring us closer to God that we could
[1:55:43] receive all the promises of God. This
[1:55:46] was Paul's prayer.
[1:55:47] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. Lord, let us let the eyes of
[1:55:50] our heart be open.
[1:55:53] &gt;&gt; Lord, let there be a let there be an
[1:55:55] established government in the throne of
[1:55:58] my heart that it would rule over my life
[1:56:00] that I don't have to worry about all the
[1:56:03] things of this flesh. It'll just take
[1:56:04] such control over me that it'll take
[1:56:07] care of itself.
[1:56:08] &gt;&gt; Friends, as a pastor, let me tell you,
[1:56:10] that's the only thing that will ever
[1:56:13] bring anybody where they need to be with
[1:56:15] God.
[1:56:17] That's the only thing
[1:56:18] &gt;&gt; that'll bring you a liberty. You can
[1:56:20] serve God. And even when you're going
[1:56:22] through trials, that's the reason why
[1:56:24] that you don't have to live with a
[1:56:26] condemned heart because Satan comes and
[1:56:28] tricks you and traps you and puts you
[1:56:29] all kinds of trouble. But you know what
[1:56:31] a believer does when you get in a trap?
[1:56:32] Then you go you turn around and he said
[1:56:34] you immediately you just turn around and
[1:56:35] say, "God, I'm sorry. I I didn't mean to
[1:56:37] do that. I didn't I didn't mean to act
[1:56:39] out like that. I I didn't mean to say
[1:56:40] that." Said because you're a believer
[1:56:42] and there's something else on the
[1:56:43] control of your heart. It don't mean
[1:56:46] that. That's how you don't live in
[1:56:47] condemnation. You can live in the
[1:56:48] liberty of the word that we still have a
[1:56:51] flesh and it fails sometimes. Sometimes
[1:56:53] we get ahead of oursel. Come on, Moses.
[1:56:56] &gt;&gt; Sometimes we get ahead of oursel. We
[1:56:58] take things matters into our own hands.
[1:57:00] &gt;&gt; Said, but just let God
[1:57:02] &gt;&gt; have his way.
[1:57:04] &gt;&gt; Let God lead us. I wonder how many this
[1:57:06] morning could say, "Brother man, I still
[1:57:08] got room to grow. I lift my hands. I've
[1:57:10] still got room to grow. I I'm not where
[1:57:12] I need to. I've got room to grow. Lord,
[1:57:14] I pray that you'll give me the I pray I
[1:57:16] can give the same mercy and grace that I
[1:57:18] need from you.
[1:57:20] &gt;&gt; Let me give that to others. Let Let my
[1:57:22] testimony be a testimony of of showing
[1:57:24] grace and mercy. Let me find somebody in
[1:57:26] a fault. Let me let me go into prayer
[1:57:28] and interceding for them.
[1:57:29] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:57:31] Let me have it on my heart.
[1:57:34] A ray of hope. Amen. Let's just bow our
[1:57:37] heads together. Gracious heavenly
[1:57:39] father,
[1:57:40] Lord, what a a thought Lord this morning
[1:57:43] that's just dropped in our hearts
[1:57:46] God that even in the evening time Lord
[1:57:49] at the end of this great day Lord when
[1:57:51] revelation would would be so lack in the
[1:57:56] among the churches today. But God, here
[1:57:59] you gave us this great message, Lord,
[1:58:01] that would open our eyes to the truth of
[1:58:04] the resurrection, Lord, that we could
[1:58:06] see it as a witness, Lord. We're so
[1:58:08] thankful, Lord, to be a people, Lord,
[1:58:10] that has recognized that, God, that
[1:58:13] you've turned our hearts today, Lord,
[1:58:15] hear the every hand almost in the
[1:58:17] building, Lord, that's been raised,
[1:58:18] Lord, that would testify that our heart
[1:58:20] has been turned. Lord, we just thank
[1:58:22] you, Lord, for a revelation in this
[1:58:24] hour. I ask you that something may have
[1:58:27] been said, Lord, that would be a help to
[1:58:29] somebody, Lord. May we may we just
[1:58:32] rejoice in thy word, Lord. May there be
[1:58:35] strength that would come to every
[1:58:36] believer, Lord. Every trial, everything
[1:58:37] that we face, Lord. May we retreat to
[1:58:40] the word of God to find the answer.
[1:58:42] Lord, may you be a restore of faith. We
[1:58:45] thank you for it now in Jesus Christ's
[1:58:48] name we pray.
[1:58:50] Will I say, "Open the eyes of my heart,
[1:58:55] Lord.
[1:58:56] [Music]
[1:58:57] Open the eyes of my heart.
[1:59:01] I want to see you.
[1:59:06] I want to see you."
[1:59:11] Will I say, "Open the eyes of my heart,
[1:59:15] Lord.
[1:59:17] Open the eyes of my heart.
[1:59:21] I want to see you.
[1:59:26] I want to see you.
[1:59:31] To see you high and lifted up,
[1:59:37] shining in the light of your glory.
[1:59:42] Pour out your power and love as we sing.
[1:59:48] Holy, holy, holy,
[1:59:53] holy, holy, holy.
[1:59:57] I want to see you.
[2:00:02] I want to see you.
[2:00:08] Open the eyes of my heart, Lord.
[2:00:13] Open the eyes of my heart.
[2:00:17] I want to see you.
[2:00:21] Yes, I want to see you. I say,
[2:00:28] open the eyes of my heart. Yes, my Lord.
[2:00:35] I
[2:00:37] want to see you.
[2:00:41] Yes, I want to see you.
[2:00:46] To see you high
[2:00:49] and lifted up,
[2:00:52] shining in the light of your glory.
[2:00:57] So pour out your power and love as we
[2:01:01] sing holy, holy, holy.
[2:01:07] I sing holy, holy, holy.
[2:01:11] I want to see you.
[2:01:16] I want to see you.
[2:01:22] Amen. Can we give the Lord a hand clap
[2:01:23] of praise this morning? How many say
[2:01:26] that's my prayer Lord let my heart be
[2:01:28] open to the fullness of the word of God.
[2:01:32] making me cry if a D maybe
[2:01:37] I love you Lord
[2:01:41] for your mercy never fails me
[2:01:46] and all my days I've been held in your
[2:01:50] hand
[2:01:52] from the moment that I wake up till I
[2:01:56] lay my head
[2:01:59] I will sing of the goodness
[2:02:02] of God.
[2:02:06] Cuz all my life you have been faithful.
[2:02:11] [Music]
[2:02:13] And all my life you have been so so
[2:02:17] good.
[2:02:19] With every breath that I am able,
[2:02:24] I will sing of the goodness of God.
[2:02:30] I will sing of the goodness of God.
[2:02:36] I love your voice.
[2:02:40] You have led me through the fire
[2:02:44] in the darkest night. You're close like
[2:02:48] no other.
[2:02:51] I've known you as a father,
[2:02:54] known you as a friend,
[2:02:57] and I have lived in the goodness of God.
[2:03:03] So I say
[2:03:06] all my life, Lord, you have been
[2:03:09] faithful.
[2:03:12] [Music]
[2:03:14] You've been so good
[2:03:18] with every breath that I am able.
[2:03:23] Well, I will sing of the goodness of
[2:03:27] God.
[2:03:29] I will sing
[2:03:31] of the goodness. Has he been faithful to
[2:03:34] you? Can you sing it to him? And I say
[2:03:37] all my life, Lord, you have been
[2:03:41] faithful.
[2:03:45] Lord, you've been so so good with every
[2:03:50] day.
[2:03:52] I am able. I will sing of the goodness
[2:03:58] of God.
[2:04:00] Yes, I will sing of the goodness of God.
[2:04:07] Well, I will sing of the goodness of
[2:04:11] God.
[2:04:13] Yes, I will sing. Might that powerful
[2:04:16] lyric? With every breath that I am able,
[2:04:20] I will sing of God's goodness. The Bible
[2:04:22] said, "Let everything that has a breath
[2:04:24] praise ye the Lord." How many say,
[2:04:26] "Praise the Lord this morning." Isn't
[2:04:28] his word good? Isn't he good to us? And
[2:04:31] brother David, he wouldn't even leave
[2:04:32] you in darkness, but in the evening
[2:04:35] time, he would shed the light of his
[2:04:38] word upon you. And that little ray of
[2:04:40] hope turned into a grave. There was one
[2:04:43] time in your life that's all you had was
[2:04:45] a little ray of hope of a little
[2:04:47] scripture that your mama told you when
[2:04:49] you was a little boy. But then there
[2:04:50] come a time in your life when that ray
[2:04:52] of hope turned into a great beam that
[2:04:54] opened up in your heart. Begin to reveal
[2:04:57] the word of God. Now you can stand on
[2:04:59] your own two feet. I don't have to
[2:05:00] follow you around and be your Holy
[2:05:02] Ghost. I don't have to go to your house
[2:05:04] and and fix everything in your house. I
[2:05:05] I don't have to walk around and try to
[2:05:07] correct everything about your life.
[2:05:08] There's something on the inside of you
[2:05:10] that's leading and guiding you.
[2:05:12] &gt;&gt; That ray of hope was turned into a great
[2:05:14] light.
[2:05:16] &gt;&gt; That's what we need this morning. I pray
[2:05:18] you find it.
[2:05:19] &gt;&gt; I pray you find a revelation to go with
[2:05:21] it.
[2:05:22] &gt;&gt; Amen. Isn't his word wonderful?
[2:05:25] &gt;&gt; Amen. Children of God,
[2:05:27] my
[2:05:29] powerful
[2:05:31] that God has given us a great love. You
[2:05:33] love the Lord this morning.
[2:05:34] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:05:35] &gt;&gt; Amen. How many's been going through some
[2:05:36] trials? It's okay. Be honest. Let
[2:05:38] everybody else know. Then we know who to
[2:05:39] pray for. Everybody pray for everybody
[2:05:41] else.
[2:05:43] &gt;&gt; Just go ahead and look around. Everybody
[2:05:44] pray for everybody else.
[2:05:47] I mean, every one of us, every day, I I
[2:05:49] I said things I shouldn't have said. I
[2:05:51] done things I shouldn't do. I think
[2:05:52] things I shouldn't think. Anybody else
[2:05:54] ever feel that way?
[2:05:55] &gt;&gt; But you know what? I find myself every
[2:05:57] evening, Lord, forgive me. I I got a
[2:05:59] little ahead of myself. Lord, I got a
[2:06:01] little ahead of you. I I shouldn't have
[2:06:02] acted that way. I I that ain't that
[2:06:04] ain't the nature of Christ. Lord, help
[2:06:06] me.
[2:06:07] &gt;&gt; That's the way we ought to be.
[2:06:09] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. Can we sing the key of D
[2:06:12] just as we go? Uh yeah. Key of D. Well,
[2:06:17] I
[2:06:18] got a feeling
[2:06:21] everything's going to be all right.
[2:06:25] Oh, I won't you just go around, shake
[2:06:29] somebody's hand this morning. Say, "It's
[2:06:31] going to be all right." be all right.
[2:06:35] Oh, I
[2:06:37] got a feeling
[2:06:40] everything's going to be all right.
[2:06:44] Be all right.
[2:06:46] Be all right.
[2:06:48] Be all right.
[2:06:51] [Music]
[2:06:54] Will God send Moses to lead all his
[2:06:57] people out? But Pharaoh's heart was
[2:07:00] hard. He thought he'd give him a new
[2:07:02] round
[2:07:03] [Music]
[2:07:14] out over the sea. But the Lord answered
[2:07:18] Moses with a little gentle breeze. I can
[2:07:21] see Moses now with a smile on his face
[2:07:26] telling all the people with his gentle
[2:07:29] grace. I' got a feeling
[2:07:34] everything's going to be all right.
[2:07:38] Oh, I
[2:07:41] got a feeling
[2:07:43] everything's going to be all right.
[2:07:47] Oh, I
[2:07:50] got a feeling
[2:07:52] it's everything will be all right.
[2:07:56] Be all right.
[2:07:58] Be all right.
[2:08:01] It's going to be all right. You know,
[2:08:05] well, a little boy named went out the
[2:08:09] pot of time. And everybody laughed. It's
[2:08:12] such a cutie little sign.
[2:08:17] armed only with a sling and beside
[2:08:20] mighty Eli seems such a puny little
[2:08:23] thing. But David said, "You come to me
[2:08:26] with spear and a sword. But I come to
[2:08:30] you in the name of the Lord." He put in
[2:08:34] a stone and he gave it a flame. And when
[2:08:38] he left his hand, David, he began to
[2:08:41] sing. Well, I
[2:08:44] got a feeling
[2:08:46] everything's going to be all right.
[2:08:50] Oh, I
[2:08:52] got this feeling
[2:08:55] everything will be all right.
[2:08:59] Oh, I I've got a feeling that
[2:09:04] everything's going to be all right.
[2:09:07] Be all right. Going to be all right.
[2:09:12] be all right.
[2:09:17] Well, now for the greatest story of them
[2:09:20] all. My Jesus was a dying and hell had
[2:09:25] them all. All the demons were rejoicing.
[2:09:28] They thought they'd won the war. But
[2:09:31] soon they would not be laughing anymore.
[2:09:34] On that first Easter morning, when the
[2:09:37] sun woke up the earth and the caverns of
[2:09:40] the deep opened up to give birth to a
[2:09:44] resurrected savior with healing in his
[2:09:47] wings and now the host of children can
[2:09:50] rise and sing. Yes, I I've got a feeling
[2:09:56] everything's going to be all right.
[2:10:00] Oh, I
[2:10:03] got this feeling
[2:10:05] everything's going to be all right.
[2:10:09] Oh, I
[2:10:12] got a feeling
[2:10:14] everything'll
[2:10:18] be all right.
[2:10:20] Be all right.
[2:10:22] Be all right.
[2:10:25] [Music]
[2:10:27] But now for the great story of them all
[2:10:31] that Jesus was a dying hole.
[2:10:36] The demons were rejoicing. They thought
[2:10:39] they won the war. But soon they would
[2:10:42] not be laughing anymore. Come on that
[2:10:45] Easter morning when the sun goes up to
[2:10:48] earth in the caverns of the deep open up
[2:10:52] to you and a resurrected savior with
[2:10:55] healing in his wings. He brought the
[2:10:58] light back to the world and now we can
[2:11:01] sing and I'
[2:11:03] got a feeling
[2:11:06] everything's going to be all right.
[2:11:09] Oh, I
[2:11:12] got a feeling
[2:11:14] everything's going to be all right.
[2:11:18] Oh, I
[2:11:20] got this feeling
[2:11:22] everything will be all right.
[2:11:26] Be all right.
[2:11:28] Be all right.
[2:11:31] Be all right.
[2:11:34] It'll be all right. Be all right.
[2:11:39] be all right.
[2:11:42] [Music]
[2:11:48] There's a happy land of promise over in
[2:11:52] the great beyond where the saved of
[2:11:56] earth will soon glory share
[2:12:00] and where the souls of men will enter to
[2:12:03] live forever more. And everybody will be
[2:12:07] happy over there.
[2:12:10] And I think everybody
[2:12:14] will be happy. We'll be happy
[2:12:18] over there. Well, we will shout and sing
[2:12:24] God's praises.
[2:12:26] We'll be happy over there. Well, there's
[2:12:30] a happy land.
[2:12:33] [Music]
[2:12:41] Glory, glory to the lamb.
[2:12:45] I said they're going to be happy.
[2:12:48] Well, everybody
[2:12:50] will be happy. We'll be happy over
[2:12:55] there. Well, we will shout and sing
[2:12:59] God's praises, everybody. We'll be happy
[2:13:02] over there when I say everybody
[2:13:07] will be happy. We'll be happy over
[2:13:12] there. Well, we will shout and sing
[2:13:16] God's praises. Everybody, we make happy
[2:13:19] over
