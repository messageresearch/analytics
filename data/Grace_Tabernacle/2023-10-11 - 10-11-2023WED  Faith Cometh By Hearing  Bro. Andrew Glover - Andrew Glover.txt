different amilies and ones and churches that are coming to support the meetings and uh it's of course if you've never been to a a Tent Revival I'm going to tell you there's some some ground rules and that wasn't a joke but uh well there's some ground rules and and what it is is that you just come out and forget about all the things that's going on and know there's a lot of pressures in this life right now and things that people are going through but we just wanted to provide a place that you could come and let us all go and and just get along with the Lord and have fellowship with God and allow God to speak to your heart and I believe it's going home time we we just want to be able to come and fellowship one with another and sure appreciate all the different ones that will be playing and singing from different churches brother Ben Pur so highly supportive of the meeting and I know many of youall how many youall from Brother Ben's go ahead and raise your hand I appreciate you

tonight let's just bow our heads together in this opening night in this meeting I know it's a maybe one of those Services where we just get the ice broke or get all the Kinks out of the way or whatever but I believe we're Believers here tonight and I believe Believers know how to have church yes sir want you just join your faith with us tonight and let's just dedicate this place and dedicate our place and let's invite him on this first night to come in and set the direction of this meeting by his presence Heavenly Father Lord as your Believers have gathered here on this Wednesday evening Lord the first night of this tent meeting Lord father we've not come here to be seen or to be heard we've not come here for form or go whatever you do whatever you expect go back home with nothing to it but if you come come tonight saying well if I don't get pra you come here tonight saying this I come for purpose and that is to contact Christ amen for my body or my soul you will go home just as happy as you can be amen for you will contact him no matter what the opposition looks like amen Christ is the answer no matter what the opposition looks like Christ is the answer I love the words of the Prophet Faith brings Christ how many believes that that Faith brings Christ he said now could you remember 80y old Simeon with a white beard white hair that the old man went around telling people he wasn't until he seen the Lord's Christ he said what a beautiful picture of faith can I give you some principles of faith on the first night of this meeting amen Faith knows no defeat amen can we say that Faith know no defeat can I say faith is perfect amen Faith brings things when there's no things to be brought amen Faith creates amen Faith takes away doubt it takes the negative and makes it positive amen faith is positive faith is a Creator faith is not negative faith is positive and if faith comes in the church it'll take the negative and turn it into the positive it'll take the sick and turn them into heal it'll take the bound and turn them into free amen and Faith cth by hearing and hearing by the word of God how beautiful that old man 80 years old Simon had a basis for Faith and his faith was not mythical it was not something mentally worked up it happens in a person's heart when faith is a something in the person's heart or it's not to have a foundation Faith Foundation amen faith has no hindrances are you with me tonight faith is positive Faith knows no defeat Faith calls things in are as though they're not and Fa are not as though they are faith has no hindrances look said men of all ages that has Faith what they're trying to achieve has been persistent he said and you have to be persistent you cannot just sit back and say well I'll see what John do does about it you cannot do that before you can be persistent you've got to have faith in what you're will not persist then first is to have faith now and then you've got to know what source you're drawing your faith fromen where is your faith coming from where is your faith coming from the prophet of God says amen what you're wanting has got to be in amen what you're drawing from like if you're wanting wateren you cannot go to a desert and a cactus and draw water out of a cactus there's no water in the cactus to come out and to satisfy the desire you're thirsting for amen but if you want water you go to a whale oh God can we preach if you want water you go to a whale and then because you got a Fai that there's already water in the well there and you pull it out of there been trying to get Faith out of your problems for years and you're sit defeated and faithless and weak no strength to praise Goden but you got to change where you're drawing from you got to change your drawing from situations and going from this problem and going from this problem you got to turn your eyes away and Look Away to Jesus am and dra strength for him there's no faith in your sickness but there's faith in faith in the answer there's no questionin but there is faith in this message and if you turn your attention from the things of the world to the things of God and start calling you'll pull an answer you'll pull a miracle you'll pull a healing because faith is in the [Applause] word to be God in here first to make Faith now I'm going to say it it has to be God in here first to make Faith amen John 1:1 says in the beginning and the Word was with God and the Word was God and in the 14th verse the word was made flesh and dwelt Among Us now let me ask you this then where was God he was in the word and where was the word it was in God because God is the word then when the word was made flesh somebody Hallelujah they do more listening to it when they got the P that have trying to on every feeling the to the [Applause] building I say get the message young people and it'll get you from the a message you of the word of God and a faith will come out [Applause] let every man be swift to hear and slow to speak you know it's not popular when it didn't be not become popular to quote a prophet when it didn't become when it become not popular to do it then in the days of the voice of the Seth Angel when he shall begin to sound listen his voice is proceeding something what is his voice proceeding brother Jeff his voice is proceeding the word and the word is the source of Faith Prophet says he said the church today ought to be pressing everywhere and to hear the word of God why are you all here tonight you had to press through some things come on Church you had to press through some things but you're here to hear the word see now watch what the spirit of Prophecy spoke about the age we're living in though the spirit of Prophecy said in Amos 8 And1 said behold the days cometh say the Lord God that I will send famine in the land it's not a famine of bread nor a thirst for water amen but of hearing the words of the Lord said he said there will come a famine in the land not for bread and water amen but for hearing of the word of God now watch this the true word of God now do you realize there's not a famine for the word it did not say brother Caleb there would be a famine for the word it said there would be a famine for the hearing of a word you know why because we've got plenty of word we've got the seals revealed we've got the church ages revealed we have had the mind of God brought into this age by a prophet of God listen there's plenty of word but there is a famine for the hearing of the word he said if they don't fit this nation this time I don't know where it does fit we don't need bread we got plenty of it we don't need clothes we got plenty of them nice homes everything amen but there's a famine for the hearing of the word of God a man won't know what to believe that's right he said all confus one says this one says that one says this one says something else amen but base your thoughts Amen on thus sayith the Lord and God will confirm it base your thoughts on thus sayith the Lord and God will confirm it in other words what thus sayith the Lord be the foundation for your faith and the only way we have thus sayith the Lord is God has sent a prophet who has said th what the Lord had on his heart to say listen friends this message is not sayth the Lord to this generation it's say the Lord to the marriages it's not the Lord to the young people it's th come on church this message is thus sayth the Lord so put your faith on thus sayth the Lord and follow in the direction of the S the Lord he said we've lived to see the day when one says this way and one says that way but we're thankful Lord that you said I am the way I like that man we live to see one said go this way and one said go that way but we had a Prophet come in this generation who picked up the Bible and said don't go that way brother M don't go this way amen go this way I am the way and if you are the way then your present here now amen to prove that you are the way if Jesus said I am the what the truth and the M then if he said follow me I am the way that he's here present now to confirm he is the way listen friends the only way we know the way is we received a prophet say the Lord and when he begin to sound there was a word he was sounding I love the Bible because in Daniel 9 I hope this is okay in Daniel 9 the Bible says amen that I Daniel understood by books can I say that we today understand by books I Daniel understood by books we today understand by books and the prophet said I understand in the last days will come a famine that the churches will be so organized and so set and everything that in the last days will come a famine and it'll not be for the bread of water but for the hearing of the word of the Lord he said I also understand that he'll send Elijah before that day comes at he end of time and he'll have a message that'll turn the heart he'll have a message that will turn the heart he didn't say brother The Joy would turn the head he said he would turn the heart of the children back to the fathers back to the original go back to the end and start now I understand that'll take place just before amen the spirit leaves the Gentile Church to return to the Jews just before that happens Elijah's message will come into the church by the sounding of the voice of the seventh angel and it will be a faith washing in the church this message will wash your faith come on church this message will wash your faith it'll wash it down from all the denominational influence it'll wash it down from all the emotional and worly and indiffer influence it'll wash your faith down to where the Bible said it'll be a Sanctified Faith it'll be cleansed with the washing of the Water by the word you know what the water of separation is the Waters of separation is the word and Faith cometh by hearing amen by hearing of the word that how you going to get Faith unless you hear the word and how you going to be washed unless you hear the word I might as well preach it's time I might as well bust it open and how are you going to hear unless you show up to hear amen come on you got to show up to be washed you got to show up to hear the word somebody shout hallelujah the word got to be preached and if the word cannot be preached unless somebody sent to preach it and the word cannot be received unless God put somebody in the to receive the word he said to be listen I want to say this God's word will not return unto him vo will accomplish what it is set to do let say this my God's word will not return to him and the angel that brought the word have to give a reason for why you didn't receive it if it's your not to receive the word of godil Hell the spirits the bad days good days up days down days in days out days stop you from receiving the forun word that has come to set you free the word of God the Waters of Separation amen through the water through the wash of the Water by the word you come and hear the word are you ready for this you come and hear the word and the first thing it does is it separates you to move your thoughts from the evil to the good W Glory the first thing the word does is it separates you and it moves your thoughts from the evil to the good are you hearing me when you hear the word the word moves your thoughts from the evil to the good now listen to The Prophet every person he's speaking of a Sanctified life every person amen lives in a three room house he said no matter how many rooms you may have he said you still live in a three room house he said God lived in a three room house back in his Tabernacle which was the congregation the courts of the congregation amen the holy place and the holy h of holies he said now listen he said just like the steps come to Amen to the place of a full consecration with Christ now watch this the kitchen is where you eat so the sinner comes to the meeting and he feasts on the word because Faith cometh by hearing and hearing of the word he comes to hear the word and many times now I may get tired here but let me preach many times we substitute so much amen instead of the word especially today he said we're substituting the pH we're sub a lot of other things that shouldn't be can I say what the prophet said he said after all church is for the preaching of the word come on church church is for the preaching of the word this is a t meeting it's church and it's for the preaching of how say Lord preach the word to me this weekend no matter what vessel stands there just let me hear the word that'll separate me from the negative and bring me to the positive it'll separate me from the evil and'll move me to The Good the church is for the preaching of the word testimonies refine different things we do is wonderful but we must give the word first place because it's for The Sinner and for the people that has the Holy Spirit also I know some yall said praise God the but don't stop there read all the CL it's for you this the Holy Ghost also because Jesus when he was tempted said is written amen that man shall not live by bread alone but by every word that proceedeth out of the mouth of God see the Holy Spirit feeds on the word of God he takes the word and places it into your heart and makes you grow in strength and do good Bible exploits amen so you see the argument that just doesn't stand we're not to argue we are to preach the word and God will have somebody God will have somebody that will hear it and receive it those who Jesus die to hear the word they'll hear it those who Jesus die to hear the word they're going to hear it you know why they're going to hear it because faith faith cometh by hearing now watch what this Prophet says he said you remember in Hebrews 11:1 we're POS it let's read it amen faith is the substance of what things hope for it's the evidence of Things Not Seen amen for by it amen the elders obtained a good report and through faith we understand that the worlds were framed by the word of God so that the things which were seen were not made of things which to appear Hebrews 11 the Bible says amen by faith God spoke the world into existence because it was a premeditated word but as soon as he said it it become life the word you're sitting on tonight is the Earth but it was a premeditated word and brother joob the minute it crossed the lips of spirit of God and spoke amen it become life he said now you say I believe that brother random in your heart you can believe it then express it I believe it don't never change it stay right with it watch what will grow out of it it'll produce the word CA it's faith and wisdom takes you away from it but Faith brings you to it see then what is faith is God by I know I'm reading lot but I'm doing this on purpose is God revealing the spirit revealing to you something that he's going to do or he's promised to do now if you only hear Faith cometh by hearing amen but hearing is not Faith a loaf of bread is purchased for 25 cents but 25 cents is not a loaf of bread see hearing only brings the word that produces Faith amen but faith is the substance of things hop for it's the evidence of it's not seen and you see you hear the word and God reveals it to you and confirms that it's the truth and by Spirit revealed truth confirms your faith to God listen Church the message of the hour amen is the spirit speaking truth to you which is Vindicated truth to fall into your life and manifest what God said he would do for you now I'm just going to say what a prophet said he said the church in differences has the same old Roman insect that started in I seea he said the korm eat it down and the Locust eat it down and the pom MaDee it down and the caterpillar ate it down amen but God said I will restore I will restore unto you all the years that the gorm and the Ponder worm ate away I love what the prophet says infallible word of God as the sun rose up Amen to show Superstition all the years of the caterpillars destroyed we pray father that you'll send and the resurrection power of Christ that you might restore and resurrect us somebody say resurrect us to a living faith in the Living Word of this day and church we not here this weekend to re receive dead Faith with dead Creeds and dead ideas we're here to receive a Living [Applause] Faith from The Living Word of this day now Romans 10 I read it to you this opening scripture Romans 10 Paul there is speaking to the Romans which had been heathens which were idolators and they had just come over into Christianity and when Paul writes this he's speaking to them about faith you know in the fourth chapter of Romans he speaks to about Abraham being justified how many believes Abraham was justified by faith in Romans the 9th chapter he's speaking on the election of God how that God called Esau Jacob and ordained Jacob see there is called election by faith but in the 10th chapter somebody say the 10th chapter 10th chapter we find him now dividing what faith is now Faith is Burly my how I like to think of Faith he said watch hope what a beautiful thing hope is little timid hope lovely and sweet as she is yet she's the greatest enemy that faith has the greatest enemy that face God is Hope because a person becomes so hopeful till they get away from Faith see but hope will agree with the Bible hope will say it's true hope will say I believe every bit of it amen but hope says it's in the future amen but faith is Burly faith is Burly he said as I once said faith has hair on the chest and when it stands up and pulls its muscles out everything else vanishes amen if you just rely on hope you will hinder Faith now hope looks for something way off amen but Faith claims it hope something off amen but Faith claims it right now come on Church the Revival is not in the future it's right now the meeting come on the meeting is not in the future it's happening right now come on know what the devil does the devil willo you with hope and Sunday morning at about 1:00 when everybody's leaving you'll still be looking for something to happen but if you can let Faith leave me alone I'm going preach if you can let Faith open up your eyes you will see that it's not H going to happen it's happening right now hope is put in the future but faith is brought at presense When Faith speaks everything else when Faith speaks everything else shuts up he said now that's the problem there's to intellectual Faith instead of being heart faith and do you all know that brother man preaches a sermon called believe from the heart he does not call it believe from the head in Proverbs 23:7 the Bible says as he thanth in his heart so is he in Psalms 119:1 Thy word have I hid in my heart that I might not sin against thee in Romans 10:10 for with a heart amen man believeth under righteousness and with a mouth confession is made unto salvation listen brother says if a man or woman could ever get their faults somebody say their faults their testimony testimony and their lives if you could get your thoughts your testimony and your life so lined up with God until the channel of the Holy Spirit would be perfectly one with God what would take place if the man and the woman could ever get lined up where with predom from their hearts with Faith from the innermost now many people come to the altar to be prayed for they have intellect ual Faith they confess their sins and they join a church by intellectual Faith they believe it in their mind they believe it because they heard it they believe it because they know it's the best policy but that's not what God looks at he said he doesn't look at your intellectual Faith he looks on the heart on the inside where God is he said when it comes from the heart of all things are possible then your confession meets up with your life and your life speaks as loud as your confession does and when your confession says one thing and your life says another there's something wrong somewhere because you got an intellectual faith and not a Faith from your heart and that shows it outside here is a knowledge of God I'm preaching to you right now outside here there's a knowledge of God but inside here is a demon of doubting somebody outside there is a knowledge of God but on the inside there is a demon about it I believe in Divine Healing but it's not for me you see it could be so but I don't believe it amen do you get it outside you say yes but inside your conscience says no listen church I'm going to preach I'm going to bust we got too many people sitting around on the outside they're saying yes on the outside they're quoting all the quotes on the inside they're saying I don't know I'm to this I'm to that amen but why don't you let this be a meeting when the outside moves on the inside and the inside say and the outside say and the CH and the preacher CH and your CH and your ch just yes but know on the inside but get of the [Applause] know brother and I don't know what Jesus said if you ask anything in my name that's right whoever shall stand to this mountain be thou removed and be thou not cast be thou cast in the sea and sh not doubt in your heart in your heart break it now but Shall Believe those things which he saith shall come to pass he shall have whatsoever he sayth say this we cannot mix the intellectual with the supernatural they have no dealings with each other the intellectual says no the supernatural says yes see now now you remember the prophet says intellectuals will say one thing I hope this is okay and the supernatural will say another and any man that's ever led by this spirit of God does not take any thought of the intellectual but he's LED from his heart by the spirit of God a supernatural man is led by his heart by Faith from the word in a supernatural way y'all remember the Bible talks about Hannah the Bible says that Hannah was bearing a reproach cuz she was Desiring a child the Bible says that Hannah went down to the temple remember that she went down to the temple and when she walked in she was screaming and hollering and the priest come out brother Joe and thought she was drunk and the priest said how long will you be on strong drink you know what she said he said that's way a lot of people are today they get sincere they're just misunderstood she wasn't drunk she was misunderstood and many men and women who are really from their core of their hearts really fully surrendered to the Lord Jesus Christ they're not crazy brother Jared they're misunderstood because the world knows their own and God knows his own come on the world knows their own brother Wesley and God knows his own and watch the Lord give you the desire of your heart he said now God could have put that baby in her arms if he wanted to even knew that he was has a way of doing things it don't make any difference whether it happened right there or not she had God's word sunk in her heart brother then the word of God was sh in Hannah's heart and that word was strong oh my that word was strong enough Amen to get her through every El of criticism that word was T sister Eve that word carried her to the church and it carried her back home come on Church the pro said as she walked down there he said what happened he said there was all kinds of critics criticizing her where you going that old meeting yeah that's where I'm going way you going to get just a bunch of emotion or a bunch of work amen but she had a promise and she walked in that Temple by that promise and she got in the house of God by that promise and she made her way to the altar by that promise the priest come out and try to rebuke her for being drunk but a promised Helder the preacher rebuked her but a promis held her and Eli announced the blessing upon her with a promis held her listen Church she could have got the baby right then and carried it back home and that would have removed all the criticism all the gangs Sayers that was making fun of her on her way down the tent meeting would have been asking her what happened on the way home but rather than let her go home with a baby God made her walk back to the same critics but she still held the promise Church Living God some of y'all had to walk through all kinds of negativity and critics and devils and this and that to get in this meeting amen but I want to assure you God has got word of a word upon word upon word upon word for you this weekend and that word rece in your heart it'll move from the intell it'll move from the ideas it'll break over to the Supernatural and the same word that you carry here or carry you out of this world are you hearing me church I'm talking about supernatural [Applause] things God said Sarah Sarah believe God he said and Hannah received Hannah received Samuel amen by believing the word that Sarah had given in the Bible what word did Sarah give the word Abraham believed I know this is simple when I pray open the only thing that Sarah had to do was to believe what Abraham her husband said right Abraham told he was going to have a baby what a beautiful picture of the church in Christ God spoke to Abraham and told Abraham and Sarah was Abraham's bride his wife now can I can I tell you what a prophetic warning is come in this generation said comeing this age and said these words it behooves you my brother my sister to consider what you're listening at yeah it behooves you to consider what you're listening at and don't you ever underestimate Satan's power for deceiving don't you never underestimate him he's a smooth as he can be God there is a prophetic word there is a prophetic warning that in this generation and said be careful what you're listening to he said again now see I've always asked you to be careful what you're listening to you know why because there's a connection brother between what you're listening to and what you're believing what you're hearing is what you're believing well it's the truth anyhow and said now today so many people are listening to enticing Spirits instead of taking the word of God he said Spirits they're in the world can you all agree with me that Spirits are in the world they're in our schools they're in our religious halls in in our government they're in our White House come on there I'm say there's even Spirits trying to get underneath this tent Spirits are real whether they're in the world but listen to the prophet he said they're demons and they go out into places and they get amongst men ministers they get amongst church members that are good people and they caus them to come into an illusion and they say things and do things and teach things and practice things that's contrary to the word of God see what they're trying to do is they're trying to substitute something they're trying to adopt a new plan he said education will never take the place education will never take the place of the leadership of the Holy Spirit now listen Church in enticing Spirits speak enticing words and Spirits travel on Words the Bible says my speech and my preaching was not with enticing words of man's Wisdom but in the demonstration of the spirit and of power that your faith somebody say your faith that your faith should not stand in the wisdom of men but in the power of God so Paul was speaking not enticing words but for word of God so that your faith would not stand in the wisdom of man but in the power of God see because wisdom always takes you away from God but Faith brings you back to God listen and there's only one way we can see a change this weekend is faith in the power of God see to change the man now listen church either this is the word of God or it's not either this message just a word that for or it's not either this is what's going to bring Faith or it's not I believe it is I believe that we should establish our hearts on the first night I believe we should establish our faith am brother Danny in the word and the power of God and not the WIS of man see it's all oh my sayil brother it's nothing but a hydrant educational pollution what is it it's satisfies their taste see satisfies the worldly church members taste but it don't satisfy Saints taste so a saint has a special taste and the only thing they can taste is the word of God and remember I'm I'm going come to a close by hearing and hearing the word of God you know there's a distinction then in your natural ear and your spiritual ear there's a distinction brother said watch 1933 the pope talking about coming to America going the holy to the holy lands also going to Rome he said spoke in the Orthodox Church they're all in agreement he said now to the Natural ear it's the most wonderful thing that could happen but to the spiritual ear it's Darkness Jesus said these words he that has an ear let him hear what the spirit is saying in the churches he said it may be that Millions will hear these words or read them amen but how many will pay heed to them that we do not know but he who will lend his ear and want to know the words of truth will find the spirit of God enlightening him if your ear is open to the word the spirit of God will make the word real to you if you open your spiritual ear to the word of God he make the word of God real to you come on church Faith cometh by hearing hearing list I come pass out here I'm dizzy I don't know what are you hearing me they will hear the word but their ear will not come open to but those that'll hear the word the word will become a reality to you and you will move from the intellectual to the supernatural I say oh god let's get on Jacob's L and cl up S and cl up in the Super of God the word can be more than heard it can be more than preached it can be more than sing about but it can be a reality you hear me the spirit is speaking and then you might have to wake them up but po somebody next to you and say the spirit is speaking the spirit is speaking come on I'm going preach and I'm going to go out here okay the spirit is speaking your feelings have had enough voice your ideas enough voice I say why don't we give this meeting to the spirit this weend come on your sickness has had a voice long enough it's time for the spirit to speak your feel kind of voice it's time for the spirit to speak sech problems and kind of voice and his church are hear me and his church is his representative this say his church the body of Believers is his represented and he that happen here let him hear what the spirit say the church over the power of the Christian Church oh somebody shout the the power the power the power of the Christian Church it lays dormant tonight because of unbel I'm going to close on this point right here the power of the Christian church is the power of God which is the power of faith and the problem says we have the power of Faith sister we have the power of Faith over the demons over the Demons of over the Demons of the Dem of sickness over the Demons of disase we have been the power of to walk on the devil I think to get our walking shoes on and walk on the devil's head again and remember who we are where we come from and why we're having this evening we're having it to put the devil in his place NE you believe a prophet or not and a prophet said three prayers I'm going read them to you father I pray you'll undo them with great power tonight great power of Faith May every thought be moved from their mind or from their subconscious that would be contrary to your divine plan tonight take it away can I give you another one come Jesus of Nazareth send forth thy Spirit tonight thy creating Spirit thy great presence to drive back the darkness of the enemy and may all the people have a creative power in their heart tonight the power of faith can I give you another one oh Jesus th Son of God come again anoint your church freely yeah fully powerfully amen thank you Lord

said watch you shall receive power after what the Holy Ghost come upon you not before when you get your PhD but after the Holy Ghost come upon you then you'll have power of Faith to believe the power of Faith to believe amen Mark 10 says blind barus Sat by the highways side begging but he begin to say these words Jesus yes th son of David someone said the Christian said be a good Cherry coffee now come on he did you to come let's see what he'll say and he walked close to him and he said what would you that I would do for you and he said that I might receive my sight now if he had enough Faith to stop the power of Faith to go way out there and touch the border of His Garment as it was with that woman and stop the Son of God with all the burdens of the world upon him going to be crucified amongst all that massive screaming cry confusion he had faith enough to be healed and Jesus said thy faith has save thee am he said Jesus told him his faith was sufficient his facei had made him whole he said now watch Jesus touch their heart as their hands are up and forgive them I pray that the great holy ghost He TI it from barus to you sit here I pray the great Holy Ghost will come down just

heard when you hear God speak it was an oracle of God and then Paul asked this question he said when you've heard this Oracle of God some would say what if some of the people do not believe then shall the faith of God be without effect he said God forbid but let every man's word be Al lie and let God's word be true I said we have the faith of God we don't just have faith in God but I thank God we have the faith of God the one that created the worlds into existence that kind kind of faith when there was nobody else to say Amen but he believed his own word he had the faith of Goden how many believe that today is the faith of God dwelling on the inside of youen I believe the Oracle of God a faith that is built for the supernal faith that is built for the for an answer from God but Mark he said it wasn't a worked up Faith it's a built up Faith I believe that's what God come to do to lay a foundation for Faith to be built in this to see a supernatural hand of friends I've been in tent meetings I've been in in probably 50 or 60 tent meetings I've seen the power of God move and you know what happens as people get out and they let things go and they let all the things of the life all all the pressures and all the the starchiness and everything go and just allow their faith to be in the word of God and allow God to move I don't know how many would give God Liberty to move I'm going to ask you I'm going to ask you to do the work that it takes you say what is that well tomorrow whenever you get along time with the Lord take some time and spend and some of the people that are in this meing that have needs and some people in your family I know a lot of times we want to pray for oursel and I'm just going to ask you that you'll think of some people that have needs and you'll take some time to pray for him and ask God to come and touch them in these meetings that that the Lord will have Liberty to do it how many would give me your word ra your hand that you'll do that tomorrow over the next few days may God bless you for it now we come expecting the supernatural I want to see a move of God I went into can I share this with they've got a dinner prepared let me just say to ease their minds they have a dinner prepared and and then I know some of you have to work tomorrow so the sisters have made to go sacks so those of you have to rush off to work they have to go sack you can just grave and go so we don't want anybody to leave without eating but those that want to stay in Fellowship you're more than welcome to we'll do that each night of the meeting and so we just want to give you the Liberty to do that but I want to share this before we go and and you know I was in a in a meeting an India tent meeting and and and it was you know just walked in there and it just you the meeting had just opened and I remember when I walked in and kind of eased and snuck out I wasn't supposed to be out there yet they kind of keep me locked away a little Hut but I snuck out into where the meeting was going on and and you know it was just just so odd because there was a little sister in the church and I watched over there some people would gather around and they started playing some music and and I I I I know the presence of God I don't know a lot of things but I recognize the presence of God I've seen God do some Miracles I've seen a lot of Miracles and people that that couldn't walk where they got up and walk and people that couldn't see that God gave them back their sight I know I have friends that are Church of Christ that call me a liar because of that but I I I can testify that I saw that with my own eyes I've seen God do the supernatural anybody here ever seen God do the supernatural I've seen Miracles I've seen God do do the miraculous I still believe in but I know the presence of God and I went to that meeting and but Mark when I Eed up there you know what it didn't feel that way it was just kind of some people sitting there and some people that were playing some music and what a lot going on but I noticed a little sister over in the back and she lifted up her hand and and she began to cry out she said Lord I Just Praise You Lord hallelujah I thank you Lord you're you're a wonderful God you're a merciful god and she began to cry out to God and it wasn't just a few seconds another lady over beside her she be to worship God and then somebody else they they started praising God and they somebody else they started worshiping God it wasn't just a few minutes the presence of the Lord started moving through that tent and before they even open the Service brother Mark the atmosphere was right for God to come and move you see what happened it was the very scripture being fulfilled where the Bible says that God inhabits the praise of his people chis let me tell you a secret I'm going I'm going to teach you tell you a secret tonight when you praise God God comes I say that inhabits the praise of his people if you can come in the services for that reason not to be seen or heard but we come to praise God we come to brother Andrew he didn't know what we spoke on Sunday but brother but I spoke on this that the first they
