[42:40] believe that God has a purpose for us
[42:43] and I know what the Bible says where the
[42:45] carcass is there shall the Eagles be
[42:47] gathered together so we're not coming to
[42:49] together in a church but we come
[42:51] together around the word of God Amen so
[42:54] we ain't here to build a church not to
[42:55] build a Ministry uh but to take the the
[42:58] very message that we have and and and to
[43:01] preach it to the people and uh that
[43:03] maybe we could not just maybe but that
[43:05] we could grow in in faith brother Bobby

[43:28] your hand and if you feel like shouting
[43:29] you shout a little bit nobody's going to

[43:34] it's okay there ain't nobody going to
[43:35] pick on you and and my if people put up
[43:38] with me don't worry they're going to put

[43:46] the Lord amen amen we just certainly
[43:49] appreciate what God is doing and and
[43:52] appreciate the the support that we get

[44:00] some Services of Brothers was texting uh
[44:02] pictures of other countries and and I'd
[44:05] put some things on there of India and
[44:06] got on my mind and and you know I
[44:09] remember sometimes you get over there
[44:11] after some long days and just feels like
[44:13] you've you've been home or gone for a
[44:15] month and and and just miserable but uh
[44:19] but the Lord moves and the services and
[44:20] that helps but when you're not in church
[44:22] it's just it's just uh It's just tough
[44:25] and and uh I remember sitting over there
[44:27] one morning and got a text and uh

[44:31] said brother just want you to know I'm
[44:33] praying for you sure love you can't wait
[44:35] to hear what God does uh for you in the
[44:37] meetings you know may just seem like a
[44:39] simple thing but to think that we have
[44:42] brothers and sisters that support one
[44:44] another and it it just made me feel good
[44:46] that somebody's thinking about you and

[47:50] morning that the Lord would give them uh
[47:52] souls for their labor amen so we just
[47:55] want to invite you to the scripture
[47:57] we're going to read out of the uh the
[47:59] book of Galatians in the 3D chapter and
[48:01] we'll start in the 23rd verse and give
[48:04] you just a moment to uh uh to get to
[48:06] that place and uh we've been uh doing a
[48:09] series on this Galatians the third
[48:11] chapter and I've just really uh I I
[48:14] really enjoy uh digging into uh uh
[48:17] scripture and and getting below the
[48:19] surface and finding out what's really
[48:20] there there's always some good stuff
[48:22] whenever uh you dig a little bit and you
[48:24] know I've always remembered that story
[48:26] uh where that you know they they said
[48:29] the man had went and and and had a had a
[48:32] a gold mine out there that he had bought
[48:34] and he dug and dug and dug and and uh he
[48:36] had spent so much time and finally he
[48:38] just got tired of digging and just left
[48:39] it alone and and and he sold the mine
[48:42] for just pennies on the dollar just to
[48:44] get out of there and and and the the man
[48:46] that bought it they sat there for for
[48:48] several years and finally they thought
[48:50] you know what it was classified they had
[48:52] you know a little bit of gold there at
[48:53] one time and somebody went around in
[48:55] there digging and and three feet of
[48:57] digging they struck gold I thought my I
[48:59] don't want to be the guy that stops
[49:01] digging three feet from the gold amen so
[49:03] I just love to dig in the word of God
[49:05] and brother Mark find out what God has
[49:07] for us amen you love that this morning
[49:09] and just to find what God has in store
[49:11] so I want to read from Galatians the 3r
[49:13] chapter 23rd verse the Bible says but
[49:16] before Faith came we were kept under the
[49:18] law shut up unto the faith which should
[49:20] afterwards be revealed wherefore the law
[49:22] was our school Master to bring us unto
[49:24] Christ that we might be justified ified
[49:27] by faith but after that faith has come
[49:29] we are no longer under a school Master
[49:31] for ye are all the children of God by
[49:34] faith in Christ Jesus and this morning I
[49:37] would like to speak on this thought on
[49:39] the faith children now this Falls in our
[49:42] series on the faith children you may you
[49:44] may have your seats This falls in our
[49:46] series of Galatians the third chapter
[49:48] last Sunday uh we were speaking on the
[49:51] hand of a mediator I hope that that you
[49:53] enjoyed it and how uh we were talking
[49:55] about the difference between between our
[49:57] mediator and the mediator that Israel
[49:59] had and you know uh how that Moses was
[50:02] the man that stood between Israel and
[50:04] God but whenever our mediator came of
[50:06] course it was Christ that Christ that
[50:08] Moses couldn't mediate for us but Christ
[50:10] could and brother Bobby he's the one
[50:11] that stood between he's the one that
[50:13] stood between us and uh and anything
[50:16] that would we would have a need of and
[50:18] so uh when Jesus would come he would
[50:21] even say these words he said all power
[50:23] in Heaven and Earth is given unto me
[50:25] I've been shouting all week over that
[50:27] to think that he would he would he would
[50:29] present himself as the Christ and he was
[50:31] the anointed one he was God in flesh he
[50:33] was the he was the father that was in
[50:35] heaven he was the son that was on the
[50:37] earth he was the Holy Ghost that was
[50:39] sent uh to those in the upper room he
[50:41] was the he was the image of an invisible
[50:43] god brother Mark and he is our mediator
[50:45] he's the Stander in the Gap he's the one
[50:48] that stands between us in trouble he's
[50:50] the he's the same God that stood there
[50:52] when Moses got in trouble and remember
[50:54] how when he got trapped out at that Red
[50:56] Sea see and he began to cry out to God
[50:58] and ask God to help brother BR said it
[51:00] was Jesus that came on the scene he was
[51:03] the one that came and he come down and
[51:05] he hung in the form of the pillar of
[51:07] fire right between Moses and danger see
[51:09] because he's our goet he's our he's our
[51:12] stand between how many how many thanks
[51:13] God that we have a mediator this morning
[51:15] he that whenever we get in trouble we
[51:17] got somebody that we can call on that he
[51:19] can stand between you and trouble I I
[51:21] don't know about y'all but there's some
[51:22] things that I can't face and there's
[51:24] some things I don't have the answer to
[51:25] and there's some trials that are too big
[51:27] for me to overcome but I thank God that
[51:29] I have a God that can come on the scene
[51:32] right now today and he can stand between
[51:34] me and a trial brother B said he's our
[51:35] stand between he's our mediator he's the
[51:38] one that came down to Moses he brought
[51:40] Darkness to the Egyptians but he gave
[51:42] light unto Israel he said because he's
[51:44] our mediator he's the pillar of fire and
[51:46] he's that same Pillar of Fire today that
[51:49] is standing here he's our lord Jesus and
[51:50] he comes and he stands between you in
[51:53] sin he stands between you in sickness he
[51:55] come he stands between you and death
[51:57] brother Bobby he's our God he's our
[51:59] mediator he's our he's our stand between
[52:01] he's our go between and I thank God that
[52:03] we have somebody brother Mark whenever
[52:04] we Face judgment he stands between me
[52:07] and judgment to make brother the brother
[52:09] was posting brother Xavier posted on our
[52:11] on our our our brother's chat yesterday
[52:13] about how that there was a Jesus that
[52:15] would stand in our place and after all
[52:17] of our all of our all of our good things
[52:20] that we could present uh at judgment
[52:22] there ain't none of them that would be
[52:23] good enough but we would all be lost if
[52:25] it wasn't for Jesus that would stand in
[52:27] the Gap and you realize that it's always
[52:30] been that same Lord Jesus he said as
[52:32] long as I am in this world I am the
[52:35] light of the world he's the one that
[52:36] brought light to Israel and brother
[52:38] Brown said in every age it's always been
[52:41] the same it's always been the Lord Jesus
[52:44] you I I've got news for you this morning
[52:46] he's the light of the world if he was
[52:48] the light of the world then he's still
[52:50] the light of the world now and brother
[52:51] Mar I realize that this morning that
[52:53] every one of us have an opportunity that
[52:55] we can walk in darkness or we can walk
[52:58] in the light but in order to walk in
[53:00] darkness you have to reject the light
[53:02] that God has sent in this age and let me
[53:04] let me tell you like this this morning
[53:06] that there is a reward for walking in
[53:08] darkness and there's a reward for
[53:10] walking in light for those that choose
[53:12] to walk in darkness and those that
[53:14] choose to reject light you notice you go
[53:16] back through the Bible you'll find out
[53:18] that they always receive their reward in
[53:20] the days of Noah those that rejected the
[53:22] light in Noah's day they walked right
[53:24] into the Judgment of a flood in the days
[53:26] in the days of of Moses and Pharaoh they
[53:28] rejected the pillar of fire and what
[53:30] happened to the army of pharaoh they
[53:32] walked right into the Judgment of the
[53:34] Red Sea even even in in Dayan was was a
[53:37] man that followed after that light but
[53:39] there came a time that he rejected the
[53:42] light of God and the Bible say the Earth
[53:44] opened up and what happened to daythan
[53:46] and and those that would follow after
[53:47] him they walked right into the Judgment
[53:49] of the Earth but remember said it's
[53:51] always happened in all ages to those
[53:53] that fail to walk in the light of their
[53:55] day but I thank God that there's some
[53:57] Believers here this morning brother
[53:59] Bobby that we're not walking into
[54:01] judgment we're not walking because we
[54:03] haven't rejected the light of God
[54:05] therefore we're what we're not walking
[54:06] after Darkness but we're walking after
[54:08] the lie so we're not walking after
[54:10] judgment but brother Morgan we're
[54:12] walking like Enoch walk and one day
[54:14] we'll walk right out of this world into
[54:16] another dimension and walk right into
[54:18] the presence of almighty God I don't
[54:20] know about you but I don't want to walk
[54:22] in darkness but I want to walk in the
[54:24] light how many say walk in the light
[54:25] this morning I want to walk in the light
[54:27] you say he said see we're walking in the
[54:30] light of our day you say well what is
[54:31] the light of our day the prophet said
[54:33] it's Jesus all the time somebody say
[54:36] Jesus all the time it's Jesus that was
[54:39] in Noah's day it was in Jesus in Moses
[54:41] day it was Jesus in the days of of Dayan
[54:44] it was Jesus in the days of Abraham it
[54:46] was Jesus with Elijah it was Jesus with
[54:49] David it was Jesus with Solomon it's
[54:51] been Jesus all the time he said and it's
[54:53] still Jesus today for he is the word
[54:56] word and the word makes the light and it
[54:58] is the light of our day friends don't
[55:00] you ever get lost thinking that it's
[55:02] some new thing or there some new
[55:04] revelation or there's a new God or we're
[55:06] following after something new today that
[55:08] some man made up thing but it's the same
[55:10] Jesus that Paul said he's the same
[55:12] yesterday and today and forever it's
[55:15] been Jesus all along see but many fail
[55:17] to recognize him today because they
[55:20] don't know who he is they don't know how
[55:22] to find God remember how Paul whenever
[55:24] he met when he met Jesus on the road to
[55:26] Damascus here Paul the Bible says that
[55:29] when he met him he fell down and he said
[55:31] who art thou Lord you realize why why he
[55:33] would call him Lord because Paul was a
[55:35] devout Jew he was a man of the tribe of
[55:37] Benjamin he was a he was a a great
[55:40] Pharisee a studier of the laws of God
[55:43] and so when Paul met that great Pillar
[55:45] of Fire he immediately recognized the
[55:47] presence of the pillar of fire as the
[55:50] Lord and he called upon him he said Lord
[55:52] who art thou that I persecute he said it
[55:55] is I jesus but said notice he called him
[55:58] capital l r d in other
[56:21] words age or her for back in the days of
[56:24] Moses but brother Bobby he said Lord who
[56:26] art thou and he fell on his face before
[56:29] God he said it was Elohim that
[56:30] self-existing God oh my to think about
[56:33] it no wonder people can't recognize God
[56:35] he could be standing right here in your
[56:36] presence and you'd never know who he was
[56:38] because you don't know how to recognize
[56:40] God it's Elohim God comes in many forms
[56:43] he speaks to you in many forms don't you
[56:45] realize when Moses wrote about him he
[56:47] went to writing about God in the very
[56:49] beginning of the Bible and Moses wrote
[56:51] the name Elohim in in in in in the first
[56:54] chapter of the Bible he wrote Elohim 32
[56:56] times he couldn't even write without
[56:59] writing the name Elohim there ain't even
[57:00] that many verses in Genesis the first
[57:02] chapter but there's more name Elohim
[57:05] than there are verses in the chapter
[57:07] because Moses Couldn't Write without
[57:09] speaking of Elohim he said it was Elohim
[57:11] that that created the Heaven and the
[57:13] Earth in the beginning Elohim said let
[57:15] there be light eloh him said let there
[57:18] be a man that was made in my image it
[57:19] was eloh him that created you know you
[57:22] say well why would he use this word see
[57:24] there's a revelation behind this name
[57:26] Elohim remember we preached a a message
[57:28] on it but Elohim it was the
[57:30] self-existing one whenever Moses would
[57:32] call him this Elohim in other words it
[57:35] was when there was no air there was no
[57:36] light there was no stars or Earth or
[57:38] solar system nothing existed in the
[57:41] world but there was still God and when
[57:43] Moses wrote about God he used a word
[57:46] that could Define a self-existing God he
[57:49] didn't just say God see a God could be
[57:51] anything we can any man can build any
[57:53] image and make it a god a god is an
[57:55] object to worship so it couldn't just be
[57:58] God he was more than a God he was Elohim
[58:01] in other words he could exist when there
[58:03] was nothing to exist in other words this
[58:05] Elohim this God that we serve is a God
[58:08] that cannot be made by the hands of man
[58:10] he's a God that cannot be created he's a
[58:12] self-existing God he's the god that
[58:15] would come in many ways I I think it's
[58:17] wonderful to think about how how that
[58:19] he's not just a god brother Mark but but
[58:21] but but see anything could be but he was
[58:23] more than a God and notice this word it
[58:26] is so so hard for us to understand
[58:28] because our human Minds it's hard for us
[58:30] to think of a God that existed when
[58:32] there was nothing that existed you ever
[58:34] just sit and thought about it and just
[58:36] you mean you mean there wasn't nothing
[58:38] there any of y'all like me you know my
[58:40] mind goes way back and I think you know
[58:42] how there was no stars there was no
[58:44] Earth there was no there was no there
[58:45] was no nothing but still there was a God
[58:47] but how did the god get there you know
[58:49] but when did he come from there there
[58:50] had to be a time there he had to be made
[58:52] out of something he had to come from
[58:54] something but but because we're human
[58:56] and we and we have a beginning and
[58:57] because we see people born and see
[58:59] people die we see we see life and death
[59:02] and we see this cycle our our our mind
[59:05] brother Mark is always looking for where
[59:06] does something come from and and where
[59:08] is it going to go but when it comes to
[59:10] God God is an eternal God it's so far
[59:12] beyond our understanding this word
[59:15] Elohim but but but you realize that in
[59:17] this word lays the revelation of how you
[59:20] see Christ today without a revelation of
[59:23] the name Elohim you'd never be able to
[59:25] recognize Christ today because people
[59:27] would ask where is this Christ where is
[59:29] this bearded man that would walk they
[59:31] had sandals on they had long hair they
[59:33] had nail cars in his hands I I'm looking
[59:35] for Jesus you you remember the story of
[59:37] the little boy that he that that he went
[59:38] to his mom and and he said Mama I want
[59:41] to see God and she said well you know
[59:43] that may be a question for your pastor
[59:45] or or your Sunday school teacher when
[59:46] you get to Sunday school maybe ask them
[59:48] and she we went to Sunday school and he
[59:49] said you know I want to see God and the
[59:51] Sunday School well that's a that's above
[59:53] my pay grade but why don't you ask the
[59:55] pastor about it so he went went to the
[59:56] pastor and he said pastor I'd really
[59:58] like to see God and the Pastor said well
[1:00:00] you know it gave him a nice theological
[1:00:02] answer and you know you know God he
[1:00:04] don't appear before men you know like he
[1:00:06] used to and you know you know you we
[1:00:09] just we just read just read the word and
[1:00:11] you know but but but you can't see God
[1:00:13] like that so the boy left out of there
[1:00:15] disappointed and he went out and that
[1:00:17] week and finally Grandpa went and took
[1:00:19] him out on a fishing boat and he got out
[1:00:20] there fishing on the water brother Mark
[1:00:22] and you know he could tell something was
[1:00:24] bothered about him and he said what's
[1:00:26] matter with you he said you know I just
[1:00:27] had something been troubling me I I
[1:00:29] asked my mama I wanted to see God I
[1:00:31] asked my Sunday school teacher I asked
[1:00:33] the pastor i' really wanted to see God
[1:00:35] and none of them could show me God and
[1:00:37] that old man he sat there and he began
[1:00:39] to cry and tears flowed down his cheeks
[1:00:41] and he sat there and looked at the boy
[1:00:43] he said he said son he said for the last
[1:00:45] 50 years that's all I've ever seen is
[1:00:47] God he said when I look out every time I
[1:00:50] see a sunrise I see God every time I see
[1:00:52] a sunset I see God when I sit out here
[1:00:55] on this w I see God when I see the the
[1:00:58] animals that that come and drink out of
[1:01:00] this stream I see God everywhere I look
[1:01:02] I see God you me tell you what it takes
[1:01:04] brother Mark it takes somebody that's
[1:01:05] been through something to be able to
[1:01:07] identify God in this age it takes
[1:01:09] somebody that that that's been through
[1:01:11] some things oh I could just see him
[1:01:13] sitting there when I was lost I met him
[1:01:15] as a savior when I was sick I met him as
[1:01:17] a Healer whenever I needed help I met
[1:01:20] him as a mediator he he was God that
[1:01:22] came on the scene everywhere I look I
[1:01:24] see God oh don't you realize when I when
[1:01:27] I lost loved ones I met him as a
[1:01:29] comforter I can't go a day without
[1:01:31] seeing God see it was Elohim he was the
[1:01:34] god of many forms you realize that this
[1:01:36] word Elohim it's a plural word the Greek
[1:01:39] Scholars would take this word and make
[1:01:41] many gods a father and a son and a holy
[1:01:43] ghost because after all it's a plural
[1:01:45] God it's speaking of many gods but a
[1:01:47] prophet of God he'd say oh yeah it's a
[1:01:49] plural word but the plurality of it's
[1:01:51] not speaking of many gods it's speaking
[1:01:53] of the many attributes of the one God so
[1:01:56] he's a savior he's a Healer he's a
[1:01:58] restorer he's a deliverer he's a
[1:02:01] comforter he's a leader he's a guide
[1:02:03] brother Mark he's the Alpha and the
[1:02:04] Omega the beginning and the end the
[1:02:06] first and the last he's a god of many
[1:02:09] names he's a god of many attributes he's
[1:02:11] a god of many natures and
[1:02:13] characteristics This Is Our God it's no
[1:02:16] wonder when Moses would see him in a
[1:02:18] pillar of fire he recognized him as God
[1:02:20] that's no wonder Paul seen him on the
[1:02:22] road to Damascus he recognized him as
[1:02:24] God because God is Elohim he comes in
[1:02:28] many forms you know why I think isn't it
[1:02:30] such a paradox of this I didn't I wasn't
[1:02:32] meaning to preach on eloh him but but
[1:02:34] but there such a paradox this morning
[1:02:36] this name for the Bible says I am the
[1:02:39] Lord thy God and I change not you ever
[1:02:41] notice that's what the Lord said Malachi
[1:02:43] 3 I'm the Lord thy God and I change not
[1:02:46] but every time he meets somebody he
[1:02:48] meets him in a different form I'm the
[1:02:50] Lord thy God I change not and he met
[1:02:52] Moses he was in a burning bush I'm the
[1:02:54] Lord thy God I Chang not but when he met
[1:02:56] Abraham he came in the form of mecdc and
[1:02:59] the Lord I th God and I changed not but
[1:03:01] when he met Gideon he came as an angel
[1:03:03] when he when he met when he met Joshua
[1:03:05] he was a captain of the host when he met
[1:03:07] John he was Jesus the Lamb of God when
[1:03:09] he met Paul he was a pillar of fire but
[1:03:12] I'm the Lord thy God and I change not
[1:03:14] see it's a paradox that people don't
[1:03:16] have the answer to but the answer is is
[1:03:19] that it's the same God and many
[1:03:21] attributes of one God that's why he can
[1:03:24] come to you as a comforter when you need
[1:03:26] comfort he can come to you as a Healer
[1:03:28] when you need healed he can come to you
[1:03:30] as a savior when you need salvation
[1:03:32] because he's
[1:03:33] Elohim he's a god of many forms a
[1:03:35] self-existing God he don't need Oh Glory
[1:03:38] he don't need nobody to build him up he
[1:03:40] don't need nobody to prop him up and to
[1:03:42] make him up that he can help you to
[1:03:43] overcome he's a self-existing god of
[1:03:46] many forms and he's still the same
[1:03:48] Christ of this age you think about when
[1:03:50] Moses wrote about him he had such a
[1:03:51] revelation of who he was he said in the
[1:03:53] beginning Elohim created the Heaven and
[1:03:56] the Earth in the beginning Elohim made
[1:03:58] man in the beginning Elohim made the
[1:04:00] Earth Elohim planted the trees Elohim
[1:04:02] put the trees in the midst of the garden
[1:04:04] it was Elohim and when he came to a
[1:04:06] burning bush notice what the Bible says
[1:04:08] when the Lord saw that he turned aside
[1:04:10] to see this Burning Bush the Bible said
[1:04:13] Elohim spoke to him out of the burning
[1:04:16] bush see Moses had a revelation of who
[1:04:18] he was Elohim called and said Moses
[1:04:21] Moses he answered here am I that's who
[1:04:24] Paul met on the road it was fell him the
[1:04:26] self-existing God but Bobby no wonder no
[1:04:29] wonder that Paul could separate law From
[1:04:32] Grace because he met the same Pillar of
[1:04:35] Fire that gave the law to Moses is the
[1:04:37] same Pillar of Fire that met Paul on the
[1:04:40] road to Damascus no wonder he could look
[1:04:42] no wonder he could separate it clearly
[1:04:44] cuz he met the same Pillar of Fire that
[1:04:45] gave one the law and gave the other
[1:04:47] Grace I thought my isn't it something
[1:04:49] that that's the same one brother Mark
[1:04:51] that's here this morning in the form of
[1:04:53] the Holy Ghost it's Elohim all along
[1:04:56] it's the same it's the same God the same
[1:04:58] Jesus he he's the same Pillar of Fire
[1:05:00] he's the same one that I know the world
[1:05:03] don't believe it no more they look for a
[1:05:05] Jesus that's someday gone by or look for
[1:05:07] him for someone that would come they may
[1:05:09] say it's false but I say it's true they
[1:05:12] say he can't heal I say he still can
[1:05:14] they say he's dead I say he's alive they
[1:05:17] say he's far away I say he's ever
[1:05:19] present they won't accept him but I
[1:05:21] accept him as that this
[1:05:22] morning he's the Paul said that the
[1:05:25] promises of God by faith of Jesus Christ
[1:05:27] might be given to them that believe you
[1:05:30] know what those promises were they were
[1:05:32] the blessings of Abraham now how many
[1:05:34] believers do we have here this morning
[1:05:36] see we're Believers everybody in the
[1:05:38] building God bless you we're Believers
[1:05:40] so if you're Believers Paul said it
[1:05:42] would be given to them that believe the
[1:05:44] promises of God the blessings of Abraham
[1:05:47] would be given to them that believe oh
[1:05:49] yeah in other words so if you're a
[1:05:50] Believer guess what else you are you're
[1:05:52] a receiver of the blessings of Abraham
[1:05:55] that means because you're a receiver you
[1:05:57] can receive s or or joy in the place of
[1:06:00] Sorrow you can receive peace in the
[1:06:03] place of turmoil you can receive healing
[1:06:05] in the place of sickness you can receive
[1:06:07] love in the place of hatred you can
[1:06:09] receive you can receive happiness in the
[1:06:11] place of Mis misery because you are the
[1:06:14] Seed of Abraham because you're a
[1:06:16] Believer this is what Peter said he said
[1:06:18] you are a chosen generation I didn't I'm
[1:06:21] I'm getting to my message you're a
[1:06:22] chosen generation a royal priesthood a
[1:06:24] holy nation a pecul your people that you
[1:06:26] should show forth the Praises of him who
[1:06:28] hath called you out of Darkness into
[1:06:31] this Marvelous Light what is the light
[1:06:34] he said it's the revelation of a present
[1:06:36] God this is what God is calling us out I
[1:06:38] know what people are calling to I want
[1:06:40] to see the great mysteries of God I want
[1:06:42] to see the seals revealed see the the
[1:06:44] that light of God how many knows that in
[1:06:46] the Bible that light represents
[1:06:48] Revelation it's a an enlightening it's
[1:06:50] it was to reveal something it would take
[1:06:52] you know in the middle of a shadow in
[1:06:53] darkness but when light would shed on it
[1:06:56] now you can see what's there see so so
[1:06:58] light is revelation and people are
[1:07:00] looking for this great Revelation they
[1:07:01] look for for great they want to see the
[1:07:03] seals open I I want to see God in in the
[1:07:06] Supernatural I I want to see the hand of
[1:07:08] God so mighty I want to see Jesus right
[1:07:10] now but you realize that people fail to
[1:07:12] see Jesus you say well why why don't
[1:07:14] they see him be because there's an order
[1:07:17] to Revelation this is something that
[1:07:18] most people miss you realize that there
[1:07:20] are some things that you'll never see
[1:07:22] until you see something else first can I
[1:07:24] say it like this in other words before
[1:07:26] you can see Christ in this age then you
[1:07:29] have to first know the age that you're
[1:07:30] living in and what the scriptures uh uh
[1:07:33] prophesy pertaining to the age that
[1:07:35] you're living so you say I want to see
[1:07:37] Christ in my age well how can you see
[1:07:39] Christ today if you don't know what day
[1:07:41] you're living in how can you see Christ
[1:07:42] today if you don't even know what age it
[1:07:44] is because the Bible said he would come
[1:07:46] in many forms God would come in many
[1:07:48] forms in one age he would be the son of
[1:07:50] David and another age he would come as a
[1:07:52] son of man and another age he he he
[1:07:54] would come as the Lord Jesus walking on
[1:07:57] the earth off through the Bible he came
[1:07:58] in a different form this is that great
[1:08:00] Elohim but if he would come today the
[1:08:03] only way you would know that he was here
[1:08:05] today is you would know the age that you
[1:08:07] lived in see there's an order to
[1:08:08] Revelation this is why many people fail
[1:08:11] to see God see there's an order to it
[1:08:13] brother brother B said in the
[1:08:14] introduction to the church ages he said
[1:08:16] like like the the burst of a Roman
[1:08:19] Candle he said the church Ages come
[1:08:21] forth with a mighty initial illumination
[1:08:24] without which there could be no further
[1:08:26] light but once the Brilliance of the
[1:08:28] seven Church ages is given by divine
[1:08:31] revelation light upon light then follows
[1:08:34] until the whole of the Revelation opens
[1:08:37] up wide before our wering eyes so
[1:08:39] brother Tom before you could ever see
[1:08:41] the Seven Seals before you could ever
[1:08:43] see the this great Thunders or or or the
[1:08:46] works of God you have to first recognize
[1:08:48] the age that you're living in so see
[1:08:50] that's why people fail to see the
[1:08:52] message they fail well I'm going to
[1:08:53] preach it anyway but but they fail to
[1:08:55] see God in the message of the hour
[1:08:57] because they've got their Revelation out
[1:08:58] of order said but before you can ever
[1:09:00] see God in that way you first must
[1:09:02] recognize the age that you live in so we
[1:09:05] come and find that this age or this
[1:09:07] church ages brother the mark it was to
[1:09:08] identify the age of the believer it
[1:09:10] shows us where we are that we're right
[1:09:12] in the midst of leysia and how Christ
[1:09:14] would appear in leysia what the
[1:09:16] condition of the church would be but let
[1:09:18] me tell you it would be an old lukewarm
[1:09:20] day that it'd be a place where the
[1:09:22] spirit of God couldn't move but I thank
[1:09:24] God that right in the middle of Le oia
[1:09:26] the Bible said but to him that
[1:09:28] overcometh I thank God we're sitting in
[1:09:31] a building this morning that's filled
[1:09:32] with Overcomers that right in the middle
[1:09:34] of that old lukewarm State there's
[1:09:36] somebody that can still raise their hand
[1:09:38] there's somebody that can still say amen
[1:09:40] and shout hallelujah and praise the Lord
[1:09:43] because we're because we're
[1:09:45] Overcomers we recognize the age that
[1:09:47] we're living in so see before before you
[1:09:49] can get these Revelations you have to
[1:09:51] first get the first one the age that
[1:09:53] we're living in how can you see Christ
[1:09:55] in this age if you don't even know what
[1:09:56] age it is so the first thing is to
[1:09:58] recognize the age we're in and then you
[1:10:01] can recognize Christ how he would come
[1:10:03] in this very age see so this is this is
[1:10:05] how Paul think about this is how Paul
[1:10:07] would introduce Christ he's showing the
[1:10:09] Galatians how to recognize him so he
[1:10:12] would he's showing them that the law
[1:10:15] would never allow you to do it here they
[1:10:17] wanted to recognize the Messiah you see
[1:10:19] it they wanted to recognize the Messiah
[1:10:21] they were longing to see a messiah
[1:10:23] there's a Christ that will come and he's
[1:10:25] going to to deliver us they're longing
[1:10:26] to see him but Paul is showing them that
[1:10:28] the law would never allow you to see it
[1:10:30] say see but before Faith came he said we
[1:10:32] were kept under the law we were shut up
[1:10:34] under the faith which should afterwards
[1:10:36] be revealed think of it first he speaks
[1:10:38] of the Mosaic Covenant how it required a
[1:10:40] mediator then he speaks of the abrahamic
[1:10:43] Covenant that that it was a promise to
[1:10:45] the believer and then he shows us that
[1:10:47] that promise now only comes by faith he
[1:10:50] said before Faith came we were kept
[1:10:52] under the law shut up under faith that
[1:10:55] would afterwards be revealed and so the
[1:10:57] promise he shows that it comes by faith
[1:10:59] in Jesus Christ and now in the 23rd
[1:11:01] verse he establishes that Faith can't
[1:11:04] come without a revelation see he said
[1:11:06] faith will come once it's revealed so
[1:11:08] here Paul is establishing that faith is
[1:11:10] a revelation somebody say that with me
[1:11:12] Faith is a revelation see brother said
[1:11:14] that's what faith is it's a revelation
[1:11:16] of God and the church is built upon a
[1:11:18] revelation the whole entire body that
[1:11:21] includes every one of us that means you
[1:11:22] can't have faith without a revelation so
[1:11:24] here what God is doing he's bringing the
[1:11:26] revelation of the hour in order to give
[1:11:29] you the faith to be able to receive
[1:11:31] Christ as he would come in this age I I
[1:11:33] know many people well I want to have
[1:11:35] faith and I got I I want this kind of
[1:11:37] faith and a strong faith said but faith
[1:11:39] can only come by Revelation it you you
[1:11:41] you read it in the Bible in Hebrews 11th
[1:11:43] chapter the Bible talks about all these
[1:11:45] Great Men of faith and when it speaks of
[1:11:47] Abel it says by faith Abel offered unto
[1:11:50] God a more excellent sacrifice than that
[1:11:52] of Cain which God testified that he was
[1:11:56] righteous you you you realize that that
[1:11:58] that Abel by faith he offered a more
[1:12:00] excellent sacrifice but said what is
[1:12:02] Faith he says faith is something that's
[1:12:05] revealed to you it is not yet but you
[1:12:07] believe it will be see faith is a
[1:12:09] revelation of the will of God so that
[1:12:12] means that you could kind say it like
[1:12:13] this so I I could say instead of by
[1:12:16] faith able offered a sacrifice but I
[1:12:18] could say this this morning by
[1:12:19] Revelation Abel offered a more excellent
[1:12:22] sacrifice than that of Cain because his
[1:12:24] faith couldn't come without a revelation
[1:12:26] so by Revelation he offered a more
[1:12:29] excellent Sacrifice by you m matter of
[1:12:31] fact friends anytime you see Faith you
[1:12:33] can put Revelation in its place so you
[1:12:35] say Anytime by faith you're healed you
[1:12:38] can say by Revelation I'm Healed because
[1:12:40] it took a revelation to have faith by
[1:12:42] Revelation that I'm saved by Revelation
[1:12:45] that I that I can come to God by
[1:12:46] Revelation I can believe that God is
[1:12:48] because the Revelation is what gave me
[1:12:50] the faith so he said it see it comes by
[1:12:53] Revelation and that's why Church today
[1:12:56] don't don't receive a move of God he
[1:12:58] said because today they don't believe in
[1:13:00] a spiritual Revelation they believe in a
[1:13:03] dogmatic teaching of some system but I
[1:13:05] thank God we're not the churches of
[1:13:07] today brother Bobby we're not the
[1:13:09] churches of today but we're the Bride of
[1:13:11] Jesus Christ and the Bride of Jesus
[1:13:13] Christ has the revelation of the message
[1:13:15] of her hour she recognized who she is
[1:13:17] she recognizes the age that she lives in
[1:13:20] and by that Revelation she's been given
[1:13:22] Faith to be able to receive the promises
[1:13:24] of Almighty God where the by Revelation
[1:13:28] think about it we offer God a more
[1:13:30] excellent Sacrifice by Revelation it was
[1:13:33] it was pleasing unto God our sacrifice
[1:13:35] been accepted by God oh by don't you
[1:13:37] realize that there's churches full of
[1:13:38] people I may as well preach anyway but
[1:13:40] but there's churches full of people that
[1:13:42] that that come in and they sit down they
[1:13:44] raise their hands they sing songs they
[1:13:46] got a loud drummer just like we do and
[1:13:48] they they they they go through all the
[1:13:49] Motions but but the the spirit of God
[1:13:51] never moves in the they when the song
[1:13:53] quits the people quit and it shuts down
[1:13:55] what's happened it's because they failed
[1:13:57] to have the revelation of this hour to
[1:13:59] be able to recognize Jesus Christ but I
[1:14:02] thank God we don't have to have some
[1:14:03] drums to get us all worked up I ain't
[1:14:06] got to have a piano to get me worked up
[1:14:08] I don't have to have some singing to get
[1:14:10] me worked up but there's something about
[1:14:12] the revelation of God's word that puts
[1:14:14] us a Zeal in my heart to want to be able
[1:14:16] to serve God why it's a revelation of
[1:14:19] the message of the hour he said they
[1:14:21] don't believe in spiritual Revelation
[1:14:22] it's just some dogmatic teaching of some
[1:14:25] system but that ain't who we are today
[1:14:27] but Mark we make that same sacrifice and
[1:14:29] God accepts it we make the same
[1:14:31] sacrifice and God receives it why
[1:14:33] because the the altar has been
[1:14:35] Sanctified in our hearts brother the
[1:14:37] Bobby it's a clean place to be able to
[1:14:39] offer worship unto God and he accepts
[1:14:42] and the Bible says which God testifies
[1:14:45] you are righteous a't that wondery how
[1:14:48] many how many how many would lift your
[1:14:49] hand this morning say I'm
[1:14:50] righteous most of us wouldn't you know
[1:14:53] why because we don't feel righteous
[1:14:55] Bobby can I read you something we're
[1:14:57] we're going to slow and read anyway so
[1:14:59] brother said it wasn't a righteous man
[1:15:00] is not a sinless
[1:15:02] man I don't feel righteous he said it
[1:15:04] was a righteous but a righteous man is
[1:15:06] not a sinless man a righteous man is one
[1:15:08] that confesses his sins to a holy God
[1:15:11] and he believes it by faith how many
[1:15:12] feel a little more righteous it's not a
[1:15:14] sinless man it don't mean that you have
[1:15:16] no sin and you don't make no mistakes or
[1:15:18] you don't have any false that's not what
[1:15:19] makes you righteous to be righteous it
[1:15:21] means that you'll confess your fault to
[1:15:23] a holy God and believe by faith that God
[1:15:26] is able to take your sin out of your
[1:15:28] life that's What Makes You righteous he
[1:15:30] said we're not righteous within
[1:15:31] ourselves we're righteous through Jesus
[1:15:33] Christ I could not oh can I just read it
[1:15:35] I manyan can I read it he said I could
[1:15:38] not even be Sanctified in my own self
[1:15:41] but I am Sanctified through Jesus Christ
[1:15:43] who stands in the presence of God in my
[1:15:46] place it isn't my Holiness it's his
[1:15:48] Holiness my Holiness won't work at all
[1:15:51] but his does because God has already
[1:15:53] accepted him and in accept AC in him he
[1:15:55] has accepted me because I'm in him oh
[1:15:58] that that's the that's what makes it
[1:16:00] real that we don't have to depend on
[1:16:02] oursel that makes me want to shout over
[1:16:04] this building that it ain't my Holiness
[1:16:06] it's his Holiness it ain't my
[1:16:08] righteousness it's his righteousness I
[1:16:10] couldn't even be Sanctified in myself
[1:16:12] but he Sanctified in my stead glory to
[1:16:15] God that's our god well I tore it all
[1:16:18] apart
[1:16:20] hallelujah it's our it ain't our
[1:16:22] righteousness it's God's War comes
[1:16:25] before judgment I hit that thing three
[1:16:26] times before I broke it it ain't our it
[1:16:29] ain't our Holiness it's his
[1:16:31] Holiness sorry brother
[1:16:33] Ben but we don't he said see but we
[1:16:36] don't sin
[1:16:37] willfully but every day can I read you
[1:16:40] this every day you're bound to
[1:16:43] sin my isn't that the truth he said
[1:16:46] every day you are bound to sin and
[1:16:49] you're bound to be backsliding
[1:16:51] constantly so it takes a constant prayer
[1:16:53] to God my I'm sure a prophet seen it the
[1:16:55] way I do every day you're bound to sin
[1:16:58] and your back's like now how many can
[1:16:59] lift your hand I think I might be
[1:17:01] righteous you know what cuz I fit all
[1:17:03] those category every day I'm bound to
[1:17:04] sin every day I seem like I'm
[1:17:06] backsliding constantly I have a con I
[1:17:08] have to take a constant prayer to God
[1:17:10] but Paul said every day I die daily said
[1:17:13] if Paul would have to die every day then
[1:17:14] what about you and I we'll never be good
[1:17:16] enough to serve God we'll never be good
[1:17:19] enough to be righteous we'll never be
[1:17:20] good enough to be holy but I thank God
[1:17:23] that I have one that is standing in my
[1:17:24] my place it's not my Holiness it's his
[1:17:29] you realize that Revelation it changes
[1:17:31] what you believe by Revelation it
[1:17:34] changes how you see things you see why
[1:17:35] we need a revelation by Revelation it
[1:17:37] causes you to have faith regardless of
[1:17:40] the outcome I I think I I get so tired
[1:17:42] of seeing people try to put God to the
[1:17:44] test I'm going to put God on to test I'm
[1:17:47] I'm gonna pray for this and if God don't
[1:17:48] do it then I ain't going to believe in
[1:17:49] God no more I'm going to pray for
[1:17:51] healing and if God don't heal I'm not
[1:17:53] going to believe in God I'm going to
[1:17:54] pray for this situation if they don't
[1:17:55] move just this way then I ain't going to
[1:17:56] believe God ain't on
[1:17:59] trial don't put God to the test if God
[1:18:03] will do this if God will do that why
[1:18:04] we're always stuck we're testing God who
[1:18:06] do we think we are to test an almighty
[1:18:09] God God ain't on trial it's our faith
[1:18:11] that's on trial this morning that God
[1:18:13] even whenever it happens I believe God
[1:18:15] when it don't happen the way I think it
[1:18:16] should I still believe God when it seems
[1:18:19] like everything went wrong I still
[1:18:20] believe God when I'm having a good day I
[1:18:22] believe God and a bad day I believe God
[1:18:25] I'm not putting God on
[1:18:27] trial he's not to be
[1:18:30] tested he don't have to be tested we're
[1:18:32] the one on trial said but God think
[1:18:35] about it the problem is is that people
[1:18:38] are searching for the wrong kind of
[1:18:39] Faith see they're looking to have faith
[1:18:41] in God which is which is a good thing
[1:18:44] but we don't just want to have faith in
[1:18:45] God I want the faith of God that's the
[1:18:48] faith that Abraham had that's the faith
[1:18:50] of God the very one that said let there
[1:18:52] be he didn't have nobody to have faith
[1:18:54] in but the faith of God said let there
[1:18:56] be and there was a light the faith of
[1:18:58] God said Let There Be A Man created in
[1:19:00] my IM there was a man in His image
[1:19:02] because that was the faith of God that's
[1:19:04] the kind of faith that we need this
[1:19:05] morning the faith of the Creator the
[1:19:07] faith of Elohim the the that said let
[1:19:10] there be and there was think about it
[1:19:12] the faith of almighty
[1:19:14] God the entire history of the law you
[1:19:17] think of this a thousand year old law
[1:19:20] Paul's writing about this and he types
[1:19:23] it with a child that was in school
[1:19:25] he said ' wherefore the law was our
[1:19:27] school Master to bring us under Christ
[1:19:29] that we might be justified by faith
[1:19:32] watch He's teaching the galatian church
[1:19:34] here all the works that they done would
[1:19:36] never bring justification although they
[1:19:38] made a great effort said but it would
[1:19:39] never bring just you'll never be good
[1:19:41] enough this is why people go for a
[1:19:43] little while serving God and then they
[1:19:45] then they they they get so backslid they
[1:19:47] can't go because they never can get over
[1:19:48] their s or their own mistakes for their
[1:19:50] own failures and and some legalist is
[1:19:52] sitting around there making them feel
[1:19:53] like a hypocrite coming to church
[1:19:55] because they have something that they're
[1:19:56] trying to overcome in their in in their
[1:19:58] life outside I'm going to say it like it
[1:20:00] is but but but but see Paul said but you
[1:20:03] the the law was a school Master to bring
[1:20:05] us under Christ that we might be
[1:20:06] justified by faith in other words that
[1:20:08] your Works ain't ever going to be good
[1:20:10] enough you're always going to struggle
[1:20:11] you're all the day you Rapture out of
[1:20:13] here the night before you're going to be
[1:20:15] asking God to help you overcome
[1:20:17] something we're never going to be
[1:20:18] perfect in this flesh you're going to be
[1:20:20] overcoming things all the time growing
[1:20:22] all the time until one day we come to
[1:20:25] that place of perfection that's why I
[1:20:27] don't just dismiss people when they
[1:20:28] struggle I don't kick people out when
[1:20:30] they're having a hard time when they
[1:20:31] when they get backslid you know why
[1:20:33] because I've been backslid you know the
[1:20:35] prophet said we go backslide every day
[1:20:38] said so we don't kick people to the curb
[1:20:40] we don't push them out say well they
[1:20:42] don't belong no more why look at them
[1:20:43] sit back and make fun of them raise up
[1:20:45] our nose like we're some self-righteous
[1:20:46] bunch of church members that ain't what
[1:20:48] we are we every one of us ain't nothing
[1:20:50] without the grace of God we wouldn't be
[1:20:52] able to make it another day without the
[1:20:53] grace of God we all sin by his grace and
[1:20:56] he
[1:20:58] alone School master in other words it
[1:21:00] was the one think about being a school
[1:21:01] master in other words it was the one
[1:21:03] that taught us right from wrongs this is
[1:21:05] what Paul's saying I think about
[1:21:06] children in school you think about when
[1:21:08] a child goes to school you know what
[1:21:09] they do in kindergarten getting a single
[1:21:11] file line they don't know why they're
[1:21:12] doing it they just do it because the
[1:21:13] teacher says stand by the wall single
[1:21:14] file line anybody been there I still
[1:21:16] remember kindergarten I I hated the
[1:21:17] tornado drills they made you come out
[1:21:19] there and they made you sit down okay
[1:21:21] everybody come the bell rang everybody
[1:21:23] come and put your hand over your head
[1:21:24] and sit down the hallway was that an
[1:21:25] earthquake or tornado one of them you
[1:21:27] had to sit on your desk one of them you
[1:21:28] sit in the hallway but but anyway
[1:21:30] brother Mark here they call they call us
[1:21:32] because it was a school Master now you
[1:21:33] know you think about this as a as a
[1:21:35] kindergarten student I never understood
[1:21:37] the gravity of what a tornado would do
[1:21:39] if it ever hit the school we never knew
[1:21:42] what it would really do can you imagine
[1:21:43] today as an adult and you look back on a
[1:21:46] thought like that it's a it's a it's a
[1:21:48] terrible thought to think of some uh
[1:21:50] disaster like that was striking but but
[1:21:52] as a child you never understand the
[1:21:54] gravity of a tornado drill was just
[1:21:56] something goofy that everybody went
[1:21:57] around and put their hand over their
[1:21:58] heads you didn't know why you were doing
[1:21:59] it you just followed the instruction and
[1:22:01] the teacher would do it that one day if
[1:22:03] something like that would happen it
[1:22:05] would be a place that you'd be able to
[1:22:06] be protected even even in your learning
[1:22:09] they never teach you they never tell you
[1:22:11] why you're learning what you're learning
[1:22:13] so the teacher comes in say says one
[1:22:15] plus one is what is two and you're like
[1:22:17] well that's good you go home mama so
[1:22:18] proud cuz you could do one plus one but
[1:22:20] you didn't know why you learn one plus
[1:22:22] one but someday you're going to be a
[1:22:24] adding uh adding systems of equations
[1:22:26] and you're going to need to learn
[1:22:28] addition and and things like that that
[1:22:30] it all maybe some of us did some of us
[1:22:32] didn't but but but but you you had to
[1:22:34] learn that in order to use it there but
[1:22:35] they can't tell a kindergartener what a
[1:22:37] system of equation is because they'd
[1:22:39] never understand it so they just give
[1:22:40] you what you need for that day so you're
[1:22:42] just following along you never have a
[1:22:44] real revelation of why you're doing it
[1:22:46] you think it's just good enough to get a
[1:22:47] pat on the back it's good enough to say
[1:22:49] you did a good job you got a piece of
[1:22:51] candy at the end of the day you got a
[1:22:52] star put by your name why because you
[1:22:54] was under the school master and the
[1:22:57] school master was leading us along
[1:22:58] listen what Paul said he said it was a
[1:23:01] school Master which was to bring us to
[1:23:03] Christ and he said listen he said and
[1:23:07] you were the school Master you were
[1:23:08] under can you imagine think of this here
[1:23:10] under a school master that everywhere
[1:23:12] you went the law was hanging over you
[1:23:16] this is a school Master it don't matter
[1:23:18] where you go you can go anywhere on the
[1:23:19] playground you can go anywhere you you
[1:23:21] could go out to the ditch by the where
[1:23:23] you wasn't supposed to be to get in the
[1:23:24] water anywhere you go the the it was
[1:23:27] hanging over you you had to you had to
[1:23:29] come back and you're going to you're
[1:23:30] going to meet the school Master no
[1:23:31] matter where you go what it's always
[1:23:33] hanging over you so here Paul is showing
[1:23:35] us that that it was there the whole time
[1:23:37] all the way through some thousand years
[1:23:39] that this law was hanging over the
[1:23:40] people of Israel everywhere they went
[1:23:42] they could never they could never uh uh
[1:23:44] be able to have this spirit of God they
[1:23:46] they could never really be free they
[1:23:48] they always had to go back and make this
[1:23:50] sacrifice and why because it was always
[1:23:51] hanging over them it pointed out where
[1:23:53] they were wrong it pointed out where
[1:23:54] they would make a mistake they go make
[1:23:56] another sacrifice to try to make it
[1:23:58] right but the law was always hanging
[1:23:59] over them I thought my isn't that the
[1:24:01] way it is today that me that that's why
[1:24:04] I I that's why there just something in
[1:24:05] my spirit that just that just gets so
[1:24:07] worked up when I think about somebody
[1:24:09] that would bind the people of God and
[1:24:11] put something over their head to keep
[1:24:13] them down and be able to keep them from
[1:24:15] being able to worship God and people
[1:24:17] can't even serve God freely cuz the men
[1:24:19] have made so many laws and put over them
[1:24:21] that men that that you have to live by
[1:24:23] and most of ain't even found in the
[1:24:25] Bible it's some man-made law that's been
[1:24:27] passed down from some great grandpa or
[1:24:29] something but they'll take something and
[1:24:30] that just becomes their law of their
[1:24:32] church and just to oppress the people of
[1:24:34] God and to make them stay under them and
[1:24:36] keep them under that great Brill of
[1:24:37] thumb and my how dare you ever say
[1:24:39] anything against it God will strike you
[1:24:42] dead or something see it's always
[1:24:44] hanging over them but listen bound no
[1:24:47] Liberty but notice what Paul was doing
[1:24:49] he wasn't saying that there was no need
[1:24:50] for a law he was actually showing the
[1:24:52] purpose of it he said the purpose of it
[1:24:55] the revelation of of its purpose it was
[1:24:57] to bring you to Jesus Christ see
[1:24:59] remember they were believing that they
[1:25:00] were justified by the law but Paul says
[1:25:02] the law was a school Master to bring you
[1:25:04] to Christ so it had a purpose its
[1:25:06] purpose was to bring us to Christ its
[1:25:08] purpose is it brought us to a true
[1:25:10] justification says so it brought us to
[1:25:12] this place but then Paul said but after
[1:25:14] that faith has come we are no longer
[1:25:16] under a school Master you know what that
[1:25:18] means it's graduation day oh my I don't
[1:25:21] I don't know about y'all but you know
[1:25:22] what it felt like whenever you came out
[1:25:23] from under that here they you may have
[1:25:25] had a mean principal I don't know if
[1:25:26] y'all have one or not but there was a
[1:25:28] couple of mean teachers that that that I
[1:25:30] went to school with and and you know of
[1:25:31] course I was a a good kid never done
[1:25:33] anything wrong and and so I don't know
[1:25:35] why they were mean but but but you know
[1:25:37] I'm just teasing but but but even if he
[1:25:39] was a nice kid there were just some mean
[1:25:40] teachers there it just seemed like they
[1:25:41] were always under you but you remember
[1:25:43] what it felt like when you said you
[1:25:44] didn't have to get up as 7:00 every
[1:25:46] morning and go down to that same old
[1:25:48] school house you remember what it felt
[1:25:49] like on graduation day and you threw the
[1:25:51] cap up in the air what was it it was
[1:25:53] symbolized in there's a liberty that I
[1:25:55] don't I don't I slept in noon the next
[1:25:58] day I I I'm not I'm not going back up
[1:26:00] there I'm not going back to to to to see
[1:26:02] what it's about I'm not going back to
[1:26:04] the lunchroom I ain't going back to the
[1:26:06] classroom what I was trying to get out
[1:26:08] of it brother Mar it was graduation day
[1:26:10] and this is what Paul said there comes
[1:26:12] to a place of graduation there comes to
[1:26:14] a place of Faith he said and when faith
[1:26:16] has come you're no longer under the
[1:26:18] school Master he brought us to this
[1:26:20] place of Faith he said and then and then
[1:26:23] we come oh I I don't know about y'all
[1:26:24] but maybe that just feels better to me
[1:26:26] that y'all must had great times in
[1:26:27] school I hated school I couldn't stand a
[1:26:29] minute of it I I I mean I I just
[1:26:31] couldn't stand it all through high
[1:26:32] school is the worst four years of my
[1:26:34] life and my and my parents made me go I
[1:26:36] couldn't stand going I didn't like it
[1:26:38] the it was slow the learning was slow it
[1:26:40] it just seemed like we repeated the same
[1:26:42] thing every day we never got anywhere
[1:26:43] and then they had take time to talk to
[1:26:45] the kids in the back of the room and
[1:26:46] they never could keep up and it it was
[1:26:48] just a miserable experience I done
[1:26:50] everything I could to not be in class I
[1:26:52] didn't like going to school I wanted I
[1:26:54] wanted to be out and that graduation day
[1:26:56] meant something to me cuz I didn't go
[1:26:58] back I it brought a liberty to my life
[1:27:01] anybody see it it brought a liberty to
[1:27:03] my life it was a graduation day you
[1:27:05] realize that we come to this place in
[1:27:07] our life that no longer was this hanging
[1:27:09] over you realize in this same period of
[1:27:11] time is when the Rich Young Ruler come
[1:27:13] to meet Jesus but tells the story of the
[1:27:15] Rich Young Ruler I love how he says it
[1:27:17] because he actually uses that word he
[1:27:19] said he was about the age of graduation
[1:27:22] he said here he come he was a rich man
[1:27:24] and he had been given all this he knew
[1:27:26] the laws of God he had kept the
[1:27:27] Commandments from his youth but when he
[1:27:29] came to Jesus there was a desire in his
[1:27:31] heart and he said Lord what must I do to
[1:27:33] have eternal life he said well do you
[1:27:35] keep the Commandments he said I've kept
[1:27:37] all these Commandments from my youth see
[1:27:39] he had lived under the school master all
[1:27:40] of his life but then there came the time
[1:27:43] of graduation day and he was here he was
[1:27:45] standing at a place that he could
[1:27:47] receive his cing gown and he was
[1:27:49] standing in the presence of Jesus Christ
[1:27:51] he said what must I do to have eternal
[1:27:53] life he said tell all that you have and
[1:27:55] give it to the poor and the man it was
[1:27:57] overwhelming what he had to do and
[1:27:59] brother Mark he couldn't he couldn't
[1:28:00] live that kind of Liberty he couldn't
[1:28:02] live that kind of Freedom you know what
[1:28:04] he did he went right back to the own the
[1:28:06] old laws to the old school master I
[1:28:08] thought my here he had an opportunity to
[1:28:10] be free just like Jesus gives every one
[1:28:12] of us today an opportunity to be free an
[1:28:15] opportunity to walk away from your past
[1:28:17] and walk away from the history that's
[1:28:19] been holding you down and binding you in
[1:28:21] the house of God and give you a liberty
[1:28:23] as a believer as a son and daughter of
[1:28:25] God that you can lift your hands again
[1:28:27] you can worship God again like you
[1:28:29] really feel like he can bring he can
[1:28:31] bring something back in your heart that
[1:28:33] used to be there the day when you gave
[1:28:34] your heart to the Lord It's a
[1:28:36] restoration it's graduation day people
[1:28:40] call out I want to be closer to God you
[1:28:42] think of it I want to be closer to God
[1:28:44] but they're not willing to change this
[1:28:46] is what he was this is where this man
[1:28:48] was I want to be closer to God but he
[1:28:50] wasn't willing to make a change I want
[1:28:51] to move into a supernatural realm but
[1:28:54] see see here's the problem is that
[1:28:56] people are looking for a dimensional
[1:28:57] change I want to move up I want to move
[1:29:00] into a higher power I want to move into
[1:29:02] this Supernatural realm I want I want to
[1:29:04] see the supernatural but they're looking
[1:29:06] for a dimensional change but you realize
[1:29:08] you can't have a a dimensional change
[1:29:10] without a dispensational shift remember
[1:29:13] we're talking about the age we live in
[1:29:14] so in order to have a to a change in
[1:29:16] Dimensions you have to shift in
[1:29:18] dispensations in other words this is
[1:29:20] what Jesus was telling him this is what
[1:29:22] Paul was telling the galatian church
[1:29:24] you're still living under this old law
[1:29:26] and you need to step into this new
[1:29:28] dispensation how many knows what a
[1:29:29] dispensation is it is a it is a divinely
[1:29:32] ordained order prevailing at a
[1:29:34] particular period in history so here
[1:29:37] here there had came a new order it was
[1:29:39] the dispensation of Jesus Christ they
[1:29:41] were living under the old order and here
[1:29:43] they were still trying to live by and
[1:29:45] Paul come down he said but you're living
[1:29:46] under the old order but God has brought
[1:29:48] a new order and you can't live under the
[1:29:50] old Order anymore because it'll never
[1:29:52] get you where you need to go but you got
[1:29:54] to step over you got to have a shift
[1:29:56] brother Mah into a new dispensation to
[1:29:58] where you can move up in Dimensions oh
[1:30:01] don't you realize there's been many
[1:30:02] today that's caught living under the
[1:30:04] wrong order they're caught living under
[1:30:06] that that that an old order they and
[1:30:08] they fail to receive the benefits of the
[1:30:10] current order don't you see what the man
[1:30:12] was offered here there was a new order
[1:30:14] that had its own benefits had its own
[1:30:16] freedom and Liberties it was the man
[1:30:18] Jesus Christ it had such a salvation but
[1:30:20] because he was living under an old order
[1:30:22] he couldn't even receive the benefits of
[1:30:24] the
[1:30:24] new but it takes a change said what do
[1:30:28] you do you move out of the old order
[1:30:29] into the new you move out of that old
[1:30:32] dispensation that that old mindset or
[1:30:34] that old that old teaching into into
[1:30:37] what Paul was saying there's there this
[1:30:39] is the dispensation of Jesus Christ and
[1:30:42] then you'll change into another
[1:30:44] dimension you remember the sanan woman
[1:30:47] when she came to Jesus here she came the
[1:30:50] Bible says when she came to him she
[1:30:52] worshiped him and said oh thou son of
[1:30:54] David have mercy on me you remember what
[1:30:56] the Bible said and he didn't even answer
[1:30:58] her a word he wouldn't even respond to
[1:31:00] her because it was the wrong order he
[1:31:03] wouldn't respond to her but then brother
[1:31:05] martin he says she changed her worship
[1:31:07] and she said Lord have mercy on me she
[1:31:10] fell down and she began to worship him
[1:31:12] and call him Lord not son of David
[1:31:14] anymore Lord what what did she do she
[1:31:16] took a dispensational shift she
[1:31:19] recognized that something had changed
[1:31:21] she said Lord have mercy on me Lord my
[1:31:24] daughter is grievously vexed with the
[1:31:26] devil lord I have need of you and you
[1:31:28] realize that even after she done it that
[1:31:30] Jesus still wouldn't accept her but but
[1:31:32] she got a response but it wasn't the
[1:31:34] response she wanted he rejected her he
[1:31:36] said it ain't me to give the children's
[1:31:38] bread to the dogs but you know what she
[1:31:40] done she said but even the dogs eat the
[1:31:42] crumbs off the master's table do you
[1:31:44] realize you ever find a True Believer
[1:31:46] you can't do anything to offend them let
[1:31:48] me tell you you can't run them off you
[1:31:50] can say the meanest thing you want to
[1:31:51] and they're not going to stop I I don't
[1:31:53] know about but I've been to India and
[1:31:55] there's Beggars by by the thousands that
[1:31:57] are standing on the streets and then one
[1:31:58] they'll come over there knocking on your
[1:32:00] window and trying to get money off of
[1:32:01] you you know why they they know you're
[1:32:03] an American and they know you got money
[1:32:04] because you come all the way there from
[1:32:06] the United States but let me tell you
[1:32:07] something it don't matter what you say
[1:32:09] to one of them Beggars you'll never get
[1:32:10] them away from your window without the
[1:32:12] car driving off brother John you could
[1:32:14] say well you don't deserve it and my you
[1:32:16] live you live a filthy life and what are
[1:32:18] you doing over here begging it wouldn't
[1:32:19] change nothing they'll still stand there
[1:32:21] with their hand now why because they
[1:32:23] need something something and because
[1:32:25] there's a need and they know you have
[1:32:26] the ability to give it then you can't do
[1:32:28] anything to offend them you can say get
[1:32:30] away from me oh but I but I have a need
[1:32:32] oh go somewhere else but I have a need I
[1:32:34] can't stand your kind but I have a need
[1:32:37] and you couldn't even offend them
[1:32:38] because they have a real need and
[1:32:41] they'll stand there until they get what
[1:32:43] they had need of but I'm Mar because
[1:32:45] because there's a real need there don't
[1:32:46] you realize when the need gets greater
[1:32:48] than our feelings when you realize that
[1:32:50] that the need for the move of God is
[1:32:52] greater than our feelings emotions or or
[1:32:54] how we feel about one another or what
[1:32:56] somebody said to us or what then then we
[1:32:58] then we take our feelings and we K them
[1:33:00] off our shoulders and realize what we
[1:33:01] really need is the presence of the Lord
[1:33:04] we need the presence of God we need a
[1:33:06] unity in the house of God where the
[1:33:07] spirit of God can come Among Us and
[1:33:09] minister to his children I have a need
[1:33:12] and it's greater than my feelings I have
[1:33:15] a need notice what she did she made a
[1:33:17] shift when she shifted all of a sudden
[1:33:20] it brought a new dimension but remember
[1:33:22] said it released a power my you think
[1:33:24] about it that shift just a shift of
[1:33:26] wording it released his anointing it
[1:33:29] released his power of healing she
[1:33:31] recognized him as Lord and she kept
[1:33:33] pressing brother Mar because she
[1:33:34] recognized him as there and she pressed
[1:33:36] on until and she pressed on until she
[1:33:39] was willing to do whatever it took he he
[1:33:41] called her a dog she said yeah I'm a dog
[1:33:43] you she wasn't a dog she was a woman but
[1:33:45] she said yeah I'm a dog it didn't matter
[1:33:46] what he called her she would have
[1:33:48] accepted it because she had a need she
[1:33:50] had moved herself under his headship as
[1:33:53] Lord and she had established him as the
[1:33:55] Lord over her life he wasn't a lord over
[1:33:58] Israel he was the Lord over me she said
[1:34:00] Lord and she worshiped him she made that
[1:34:03] shift and it brought about a dimensional
[1:34:05] change in her life it brought the
[1:34:07] supernatural it brought the power of God
[1:34:09] to her life that the Bible says whenever
[1:34:11] she went home she found her daughter
[1:34:13] laying in the bed and the devil had gone
[1:34:16] out of her thank you Lord why because
[1:34:18] she had shifted she stepped out of one
[1:34:21] order into another she took that that
[1:34:24] that Chang but B said this is what
[1:34:25] happened with the little woman that had
[1:34:27] an issue of blood remember when she
[1:34:29] heard about him she' come down
[1:34:30] regardless of what she said she said if
[1:34:32] I could only touch His Garment he said
[1:34:34] see and when that genuine faith in God
[1:34:36] became a positive thing to her what did
[1:34:38] it release it released the power to heal
[1:34:41] her her genuine faith in God it released
[1:34:44] his power to heal her it touched him in
[1:34:46] such a way he turned around he says what
[1:34:49] was wrong with her he said your faith is
[1:34:50] savior others are standing around they
[1:34:52] might have been sicker than was but she
[1:34:54] recognized his presence and she knew it
[1:34:56] was her opportunity there may have been
[1:34:58] some that was in worse shape there were
[1:35:00] in some that were in worse conditions
[1:35:01] they needed healing worse but she
[1:35:03] recognized his presence and she saw her
[1:35:05] opportunity he said if we could only do
[1:35:07] that tonight if we could only realize
[1:35:08] that he is appearing to us in these
[1:35:10] meetings for one purpose that's to
[1:35:12] release our desires that we have in him
[1:35:15] to us oh don't you see it that's why
[1:35:18] Jesus is here brother marah is that he
[1:35:20] could release our desires to him if we
[1:35:22] could just recognize his presence and
[1:35:24] his appearing that he can release our
[1:35:27] desires that we have I don't know about
[1:35:29] you but that makes me want to shout out
[1:35:30] over this building if you could ever
[1:35:32] recognize the presence of God it would
[1:35:34] release the desire that you have the
[1:35:37] very thing that you need from God if you
[1:35:39] could recognize God you hearing me I'm
[1:35:41] not talking about tomorrow I'm talking
[1:35:42] about this morning if you could
[1:35:44] recognize God this morning and you could
[1:35:46] recognize him being present in this
[1:35:47] place it releases the desires that you
[1:35:50] have the very needs that you have that
[1:35:53] are given to you to you if you recognize
[1:35:56] him it releases our desires you said
[1:35:58] what do you do you've got to recognize
[1:35:59] his presence you said well how how do
[1:36:02] you recognize his presence here's what a
[1:36:03] prophet said he said when the promised
[1:36:05] word for this age is made manifest said
[1:36:08] then you can recognize his presence so
[1:36:11] when you see Malachi 4 promised and
[1:36:13] manifested you recognize it it releases
[1:36:15] a power in you Jesus said the works that
[1:36:17] I do shall you do also that's a promise
[1:36:19] of God when you see that promise
[1:36:21] manifested in the Believers it Rel is a
[1:36:24] power in you you realize where this
[1:36:25] faith is coming from you've seen Jesus
[1:36:27] said the works that I do shall you do
[1:36:29] also Greater Works than these shall you
[1:36:31] do you look out across the land and you
[1:36:33] see even in our own church and you see
[1:36:35] sick that are healed the the the blind
[1:36:37] eyes that are open uh people that get
[1:36:39] well that the people that have needs and
[1:36:41] God meets their needs what it build your
[1:36:43] faith because you see the word of God
[1:36:45] being manifested in your age you
[1:36:48] recognize the presence of God and it
[1:36:50] releases a power in you it releases
[1:36:52] healing it releases Deliverance it
[1:36:54] releases salvation it releases Grace
[1:36:57] brother Mark to be able to receive from
[1:36:58] God it releases because you recognize
[1:37:01] somebody say that releasing by
[1:37:03] recognizing that's what releases the
[1:37:05] power of God in your life is recognizing
[1:37:07] the present Jesus Christ you recognize
[1:37:10] him in one another we recognize him in
[1:37:12] the five-fold ministry we recognize him
[1:37:14] being present here this morning speaking
[1:37:16] to our hearts by the by the power of the
[1:37:17] Holy Ghost the Bible said it's a
[1:37:19] discerner of the thoughts and the
[1:37:20] intents of our heart that's why God is
[1:37:22] dealing with you on a personal level
[1:37:23] when you come in the house of God how
[1:37:25] can he say all of this and deal with
[1:37:27] with 150 people differently but God can
[1:37:30] because he's a sovereign
[1:37:31] God he deals with us brother Markin it
[1:37:35] releases the power of God in our life
[1:37:39] you think about if you can ever shift
[1:37:40] into this place the right dispensation
[1:37:43] you realize the age that we're living in
[1:37:44] it'll bring you into another dimension
[1:37:47] see we're not under the old law but
[1:37:48] we're under the order we're not under
[1:37:50] the order of Moses but we're under the
[1:37:52] order of Jesus Christ
[1:37:53] the dispensation of Grace you said well
[1:37:55] I wonder if it belongs to me I'll just
[1:37:57] tell you what the Bible says Paul said
[1:37:58] in Ephesians 3 he said if you have heard
[1:38:01] of the dispensation of the grace of God
[1:38:03] which is given to me he said not
[1:38:05] revealed and the it was not in other
[1:38:07] ages it was not made known but is now
[1:38:09] been revealed to His Holy Apostles and
[1:38:11] Prophets by the spirit that the Gentiles
[1:38:14] should be fellow heirs and of the same
[1:38:16] body and partakers of his promise in
[1:38:19] Christ by the gospel this is the
[1:38:21] dispensation of the grace of Jesus
[1:38:24] Christ Paul said it was time when it
[1:38:26] wasn't revealed but now it has been
[1:38:28] revealed that the Gentiles should be
[1:38:30] fellow AES that means that for you and I
[1:38:32] it's the time to be able to receive the
[1:38:34] grace of almighty God this is the time
[1:38:36] to receive Grace it's the time to
[1:38:38] recognize who you are oh listen what
[1:38:40] Paul said he said for you are the
[1:38:42] children of God by faith in Jesus Christ
[1:38:45] that's what makes us his children is the
[1:38:47] faith that we have in this hour he said
[1:38:50] we're we're in the dispensation of the
[1:38:51] grace of Jesus Christ and by faith
[1:38:54] brother Mark we receive it we're
[1:38:56] partakers of the promise of God he said
[1:38:58] we are the children of God by faith in
[1:39:00] Jesus
[1:39:01] Christ think of it the children of God
[1:39:04] can the music players come we're the
[1:39:06] children of God by faith in Jesus Christ
[1:39:10] here notice how Paul words this the
[1:39:12] children of God I love this word of see
[1:39:15] because the word of it expresses the
[1:39:18] relationship between one entity and
[1:39:20] another Paul says you're the children of
[1:39:23] God
[1:39:23] in other word of signifies your origin
[1:39:26] you're the children of God that means
[1:39:29] you're a part of something you're a
[1:39:30] piece of something now you you remember
[1:39:32] remember what Jesus told the Pharisees
[1:39:33] he said you're not of God you're of your
[1:39:36] father the devil see he was showing them
[1:39:37] their origin but here Paul says but you
[1:39:40] because of your faith you are the
[1:39:42] children of God in other words you come
[1:39:46] from God remember what the Bible said
[1:39:48] about Cain he said that Cain was of the
[1:39:51] wicked one that's the revelation that
[1:39:53] shows us that he didn't come from God
[1:39:56] Bible said he was of the wicked one it
[1:39:57] was showing his origin you say well I
[1:39:59] thought the Bible said he was he was of
[1:40:01] God that ain't what the Bible said well
[1:40:02] Eve said that somebody told me that one
[1:40:04] time Eve said he was of God but that
[1:40:05] ain't what Eve said eve said that
[1:40:07] whenever that Adam knew his wife Eve and
[1:40:10] she conceived and bear a son Cain and
[1:40:13] Eve said I have gotten a man from the
[1:40:16] Lord see there's a difference of saying
[1:40:19] that he came from the Lord and he was of
[1:40:20] the Lord see of signifies origin but she
[1:40:23] said I got a man from the Lord you say
[1:40:24] well how could she say this well as any
[1:40:26] mother would that God is the creator of
[1:40:28] life and the Very creator of life that
[1:40:30] made the heavens and earth that made a
[1:40:32] man and woman that very that very life
[1:40:34] all life comes from God at one point it
[1:40:36] came by the power of the spoken word but
[1:40:38] because of the fall in the garden that
[1:40:39] life had to come uh through conception
[1:40:41] and so so all life always come from God
[1:40:44] it was a law the law that brings life
[1:40:47] was was put into Adam and Eve they had
[1:40:49] that law in their members they had the
[1:40:51] ability to sin the ability to fall they
[1:40:53] were free moral agents you you realize
[1:40:55] that they were they had the right to
[1:40:56] choose you you can prove that in the
[1:40:58] Bible they were free moral agents
[1:41:00] otherwise God wouldn't have gave them an
[1:41:02] order and a punishment if they didn't
[1:41:03] follow it see so God knew they were free
[1:41:05] moral agents because they gave them an
[1:41:06] order and said this is what happened if
[1:41:08] you don't follow it so they they had the
[1:41:10] right to choose but the the the the law
[1:41:13] of life was in them for the mark so they
[1:41:15] could bring forth life that's why you
[1:41:17] realized that the serpent he couldn't
[1:41:18] create life he was an upright beast but
[1:41:20] the Bible said he had a seed so life
[1:41:22] came from the law in their bodies it
[1:41:24] didn't come it wasn't of God it came it
[1:41:27] was from the Lord because all life is
[1:41:29] from the Lord but it wasn't of God oh my
[1:41:31] I can I can take this a little bit
[1:41:33] further you realize that when the Bible
[1:41:35] even writes to the generations of Adam
[1:41:37] that here the Bible said in Genesis the
[1:41:39] 5th chapter you can go home and read it
[1:41:41] but it said this is the book of the
[1:41:43] generations of Adam in other words this
[1:41:46] is those that that originated of Adam
[1:41:49] they this is their origin they come of
[1:41:51] Adam in the day that God created man in
[1:41:53] the likeness of God made he him male and
[1:41:55] female created he them and he blessed
[1:41:57] them and he called their name Adam in
[1:41:59] the day when they were created and Adam
[1:42:01] lived 130 years and he begot a son in
[1:42:04] his own likeness after his image and he
[1:42:06] called his name Seth you see Seth he was
[1:42:09] an appointed seed of God and he came
[1:42:12] right through the lineage of Adam I I
[1:42:14] think about this that Seth was the son
[1:42:16] of Adam and here Adam was the son of God
[1:42:22] now in that son something Enos was the
[1:42:24] son of Seth who was the son of Adam who
[1:42:28] was the son of God Canan was the son of
[1:42:31] Enos who was the son of Seth who was the
[1:42:34] son of Adam who was the son of God mahel
[1:42:38] Hill was the son of Canan who was the
[1:42:39] son of Enos who was of Seth who was of
[1:42:42] Adam who was the son of God Jared was
[1:42:46] the son of Mah Hill who was the son of
[1:42:48] Canaan who was the son of Enos who was
[1:42:51] of Seth who was of Adam who was of God
[1:42:54] the Bible goes all the way through their
[1:42:56] Generations but I think how what a what
[1:42:59] a thought it is to think this morning
[1:43:01] that here Seth could go around the own
[1:43:04] Bible the he he could go around and and
[1:43:06] and and and know out of the scripture
[1:43:08] that that that it was such a privilege
[1:43:10] to be listed in the generations of Adam
[1:43:13] how good it must have felt to be
[1:43:14] identified with God for the Bible says
[1:43:17] that Adam was of God and Seth was after
[1:43:21] the likeness in the image of Adam can
[1:43:23] you imagine if that was your testimony
[1:43:24] this morning can you imagine if you
[1:43:26] walked around reading this scripture and
[1:43:28] Ed it you read it and it said Adam was
[1:43:31] of
[1:43:32] God but Noah he was of Adam who was of
[1:43:36] God now wouldn't that be quite a read if
[1:43:39] every time you read that scripture but B
[1:43:41] you'd find your name in there you could
[1:43:42] go around bragging like Seth could you
[1:43:44] could say I I don't know if y'all know
[1:43:46] who my daddy is my daddy's the one that
[1:43:48] God created he formed him out of the
[1:43:50] Dust of the ground I don't know if y'all
[1:43:52] met my daddy Adam but but he was you
[1:43:54] know he he was out he didn't even exist
[1:43:56] and God formed a body Out of the Dust of
[1:43:58] the ground and out of the mouth of God
[1:44:01] he breathed his own life into my father
[1:44:04] and I come out of him what a testimony
[1:44:07] that Seth had I thought my wouldn't it
[1:44:09] be Wonder wonderful if we could go
[1:44:10] around and say how wonderful it is my
[1:44:12] daddy was made by the hands of God my
[1:44:15] father he was the one that was created
[1:44:17] by God can you imagine if you had that
[1:44:19] testimony to be able to say it Adam was
[1:44:21] made in the likeness in the image of God
[1:44:23] but I was made after the likeness in the
[1:44:25] image of
[1:44:26] Adam same likeness in the image of God
[1:44:30] you can go to Luke the third chapter you
[1:44:32] can find the whole entire lineage from
[1:44:34] Joseph all the way back to Adam and back
[1:44:37] to God the Bible tells every name from
[1:44:39] the time of Joseph all the way back
[1:44:41] firstborn sons all the way back to God I
[1:44:43] thought my and even today there's people
[1:44:46] that can take their ancestry and they
[1:44:47] can go all the way back to Joseph and so
[1:44:49] they can say right now from where I am
[1:44:51] I'm of this one that's of this one
[1:44:53] that's of this one that's of this one
[1:44:54] that's of this one that's of Joseph
[1:44:56] that's of this one that's of this one
[1:44:57] that's of this one some 50 Generations
[1:44:59] later that's of mahalah Hill that's of
[1:45:01] Canan that's of Enos that's of Seth
[1:45:03] that's of Adam that came of God and they
[1:45:06] could track it all the way back that my
[1:45:08] generation's come from God but friends
[1:45:10] I've got news for you this morning you
[1:45:12] don't have to go to Luke the third
[1:45:14] chapter to find your ancestry to trace
[1:45:17] it back to God but we can read about it
[1:45:19] in first John the thir chapter John said
[1:45:21] behold what manner of love that the
[1:45:23] father has bestowed upon us that we
[1:45:27] should be called the sons of God when we
[1:45:30] don't deserve it he said but what love
[1:45:33] he bestowed upon us that we're the sons
[1:45:35] of God when I'm a failure he said but
[1:45:37] what love that you can be called a son
[1:45:39] and a daughter of God when I don't
[1:45:41] deserve it when I when I fall by the
[1:45:43] wayside when I ain't good enough he said
[1:45:45] but what manner of love he's bestowed
[1:45:47] upon you that you can be called The Son
[1:45:49] of God oh don't you realize that church
[1:45:51] you have a greater testimony than Enos
[1:45:53] you have a greater testimony than Canaan
[1:45:55] a greater testimony than Seth for Seth
[1:45:57] says that was my father was the man that
[1:46:00] God created but friends I've got news
[1:46:03] for you I can go all the way back and I
[1:46:05] can say but my father is the god that
[1:46:07] created man he ain't just a man that God
[1:46:10] made but he's the god that made man and
[1:46:13] I'm his son I'm his daughter he created
[1:46:15] me in his own
[1:46:17] image and by his own love he has
[1:46:20] bestowed upon me the right to be a Son
[1:46:23] of God the right to be a daughter of God
[1:46:26] I'm a Child of God Paul said by
[1:46:29] faith I was born by faith the Revelation
[1:46:33] that Paul is bringing to the church is
[1:46:36] that you're a child of God by faith and
[1:46:38] Jesus Christ oh if you could hear me not
[1:46:42] by your own works not by your own
[1:46:44] efforts never can you do enough to
[1:46:46] deserve it you'll never deserve it
[1:46:48] friend you can't work your way into it
[1:46:51] but if you could stop for just a moment
[1:46:53] won't you stand to your feet if you
[1:46:55] could stop for just a moment and you can
[1:46:57] say it's not by My Sacrifice but it's
[1:47:01] his
[1:47:02] sacrifice is't that
[1:47:05] wonderful friend if you could ever get a
[1:47:07] revelation of that you're talking about
[1:47:08] Liberty as a
[1:47:10] believer that it ain't you mean he ain't
[1:47:13] looking at
[1:47:14] me he ain't looking at
[1:47:16] me he's looking at his own sacrifice
[1:47:19] that he made that's already been
[1:47:21] accepted in the face of our failures he
[1:47:24] ain't looking at me ain't that a
[1:47:26] wonderful thought this
[1:47:28] morning we don't deserve him but he made
[1:47:32] us but Mark in his own image we've been
[1:47:35] created it don't matter what you ever go
[1:47:37] through or what you I know what the
[1:47:40] devil's devil Works overtime to destroy
[1:47:42] your life the Bible said for this
[1:47:43] purpose the Son of God was manifested
[1:47:46] that he might destroy the works of the
[1:47:47] devil that means you have power over the
[1:47:50] Devil by by faith you're a child of God
[1:47:52] you're over Overcomers and Jesus said he
[1:47:54] that overcometh shall inherit all things
[1:47:55] and I will be his God and he shall be my
[1:48:00] son I'll be his God he shall be my son
[1:48:04] because he's an overcomer you say well
[1:48:06] well maybe one of these days I'll be a
[1:48:07] Son of God maybe I'll be an overcomer
[1:48:09] and then I'll be a Son of God when I get
[1:48:11] over there but listen what the Bible
[1:48:13] said he said but beloved now are we the
[1:48:17] sons of God not something that we're
[1:48:19] waiting on I don't know about y'all but
[1:48:21] that makes I'm a Son of God I wonder how
[1:48:24] many lift your hand in the air and say
[1:48:26] I'm a daughter of God I'm a Son of
[1:48:28] God right now I'm a Son of God not by my
[1:48:32] worthiness not when I get good enough
[1:48:34] right now I'm a Son of God by his own
[1:48:37] love he's best what love it is he has
[1:48:40] bestowed upon me to call you his
[1:48:44] son my isn't it wonderful we look at our
[1:48:47] old Earthly
[1:48:49] mess we look at this people bind people
[1:48:53] such a way I had a brother call me the
[1:48:54] other day ask me people know some church
[1:48:57] trying to bind him up and he he had just
[1:49:00] come out of this community and he said
[1:49:03] you know I've had this over me my whole
[1:49:06] life that I honor my father and mother
[1:49:09] said so I couldn't ever I had to follow
[1:49:11] whatever they believe no matter what I
[1:49:13] said well that what if your mama was an
[1:49:16] alcoholic I believe you ought to honor
[1:49:18] your father and mother as a child
[1:49:20] they're come you ought to honor them as
[1:49:22] an adult all the days of your life you
[1:49:23] are to honor them but that don't mean if
[1:49:25] your father and your mother's in the
[1:49:27] wrong that you follow them in the wrong
[1:49:29] that don't mean if they're in sin here
[1:49:30] here's an adult in a family but but but
[1:49:32] you got to follow him into sin say see
[1:49:35] but who is your real father it's God
[1:49:39] even the Bible said your children are
[1:49:40] not even your own they're mine they were
[1:49:43] given to you just to raise and if you
[1:49:44] love them more than you love me you'll
[1:49:45] have no part with
[1:49:47] me they're temporary for you to have
[1:49:49] they're God's children they don't belong

[2:02:19] so uh we just anybody that could help we
[2:02:22] would appreciate the help this afternoon
[2:02:24] 3:00 appreciate the help and y'all be
[2:02:26] praying about how many's looking forward
[2:02:27] to our our meetings coming up and now
[2:02:30] we've got we're trying to make the room
[2:02:31] we're making an overflow in here with a
[2:02:33] with a screen and the door open where uh
[2:02:36] brother Morgan's kind of got a plan for
[2:02:37] that uh we hope we'll have a little bit
[2:02:40] more seating the way we'll uh put the
[2:02:42] pews in and uh we we wasn't able uh but
[2:02:46] I know it's our desire um to to expand
[2:02:49] the church you know and we've been
[2:02:50] working on the sides and uh we haven't
[2:02:52] really got a pencil together yet as or
[2:02:54] put together a price of what it'll
[2:02:57] actually cost but um just be praying
[2:02:59] about it it's been on our heart to take
[2:03:01] the uh the side walls of this building
[2:03:03] out uh and add it'll add about 30 fet
[2:03:06] this way and it'll add about 54 ft this
[2:03:10] way so we'll be able to add a 100 seats
[2:03:12] uh I know during this sickness you may
[2:03:14] not those that are visiting you may
[2:03:16] Wonder but uh those that are here
[2:03:18] frequently there's some days you can't
[2:03:20] you can't get in here and so um but we
[2:03:23] want to make room and we want to make
[2:03:24] everybody comfortable we're also uh
[2:03:26] working on the parking lot uh adding to
[2:03:28] the parking lot that is our plan to have
[2:03:30] that done before the meeting so we'll
[2:03:33] have the parking lot expanded to add
[2:03:34] about 20 new spots out there and uh I
[2:03:37] talk to the guy that owned the land next
[2:03:39] door and he okayed it for us to take up
[2:03:42] some of the land there and make extra
[2:03:44] parking lot out of it so um we want to
[2:03:47] we want to we be working on that the
[2:03:49] after the snow so that that'll be done
[2:03:52] before the meeting uh and the pews that
[2:03:54] we just paid to get done um would be
[2:03:56] enough pews that once we expand the
[2:03:58] church we actually have enough of them
[2:04:00] that we can that they'll fit in the
[2:04:02] whole area so uh we just want to we just
[2:04:05] want to make room for everybody and you
[2:04:06] know uh brother brother Ben I I I didn't
[2:04:09] uh don't mean to put you on the spot but
[2:04:11] uh just to keep from embarrassing
[2:04:14] everybody turn around and look at
[2:04:15] brother Ben right there with the glasses

[2:04:28] welcome brother Ben and his wife and
[2:04:30] family

[2:04:36] when he was uh dedicating their babies
[2:04:38] so uh but we sure we sure appreciate the
[2:04:41] the confidence that people would have in
[2:04:43] us to be able to come and and bring
[2:04:45] their families here and Worship the Lord
[2:04:46] with us and you know friends one of
[2:04:48] these days we're going to be done with
[2:04:50] this we're going to work together and
[2:04:52] we'll work about you know the song it
[2:04:53] says we'll work till Jesus comes and
[2:04:55] that's what we're going to do we're
[2:04:56] going to keep winning Souls keep
[2:04:58] reaching out that's how this church was
[2:05:00] founded you know I I got a little
[2:05:02] nostalgic the other day and I listened
[2:05:04] to the first service that was ever
[2:05:06] preached in this building have a little
[2:05:08] recording of it and and to hear the the
[2:05:11] the Zeal on our hearts and everybody
[2:05:13] that prayed and just some just want to
[2:05:15] see God do something and a move of God
[2:05:18] in this area and so is to be one and I
[2:05:20] thought my in that very thing what's
[2:05:22] taking place some I I I don't have the
[2:05:24] count but somebody told me the other day
[2:05:26] there was there was nearly 60 people
[2:05:28] that we baptized in this little assembly
[2:05:30] in a town uh the town of Black Rock has
[2:05:34] we're we're about I think six or 600 or
[2:05:36] so people in this city and we're in the
[2:05:38] suburbs we're not even in the city we're
[2:05:41] in the suburbs of Black Rock but and
[2:05:43] people would drive down that old dirt
[2:05:45] road and in the but but we come here
[2:05:47] because we want to be in the presence of
[2:05:49] God and we came here when there was
[2:05:51] there was no pews in here these walls
[2:05:53] weren't in here it was just an old empty
[2:05:54] shell and and and people sitting here
[2:05:56] without any heat and without any air
[2:05:58] conditioning and they burned up and
[2:06:00] froze but didn't care they just wanted
[2:06:01] to be in the presence of God and souls
[2:06:03] were one and and that's what we want to
[2:06:05] continue to do and you know every now
[2:06:06] and then it's a good reminder just to go
[2:06:08] back to what we really are we're not
[2:06:10] trying to be something we're not trying
[2:06:12] to be a somebody we're not trying to
[2:06:14] create this great image or a church or
[2:06:15] build something like that we have one
[2:06:17] purpose and that's to build the kingdom
[2:06:18] of God we're not to build a Ministry of
[2:06:20] a man but we're build the kingdom of God
[2:06:22] and to win souls to the kingdom that's
[2:06:23] my purpose that's my heart and as long
[2:06:25] as I'm here that is that that's what
[2:06:27] we're going to do so I appreciate the
[2:06:29] the Zeal that you have to support that
[2:06:31] kind of a work and let's just go on till
[2:06:33] Jesus comes and how many's been praying
[2:06:35] for the meetings man you're looking
[2:06:37] forward to it and I'll tell you what do
