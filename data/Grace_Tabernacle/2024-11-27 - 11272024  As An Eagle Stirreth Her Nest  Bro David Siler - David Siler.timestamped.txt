[41:11] clap of praise
[41:13] tonight amen how many say it's good to
[41:16] be in the house of the Lord amen just to
[41:18] come out on a Thanksgiving service I
[41:20] know most are with family and and gone
[41:23] but the Bible says where two or three
[41:25] are gathered together in my name there
[41:27] shall I be in the midst of them and so
[41:29] we got a few out tonight that just want
[41:31] to come and allow the Lord to be able to
[41:32] speak to our hearts and Brother David
[41:35] has something on his heart so I believe
[41:36] that God is going to come and speak to
[41:38] us and I believe if we come in
[41:39] expectation we're going to receive
[41:41] something amen now you can go to the
[41:43] wrong place and have an expectation not
[41:45] get nothing out of it but when you come
[41:46] to the house of God and you have a man
[41:49] of God that's gifted of God and you take
[41:51] a people that'll come expecting and
[41:53] pulling from the gift of God it's a
[41:55] recipe to receive something from the
[41:56] Lord amen I believe that's scriptural
[41:58] and how many come to receive something
[42:00] from God Amen we didn't just come here
[42:02] out of a Duty or an obligation but we
[42:04] all came tonight wanting to have
[42:07] communion with the Lord and and just to
[42:09] be able to hear the Lord be able to
[42:11] speak to our hearts and so we just want
[42:13] to give Brother David plenty of time we
[42:14] didn't have any prayer requests but can
[42:16] we sing this uh song Because He Lives I
[42:19] Can Face tomorrow and we're going to
[42:21] invite Brother David to come and speak
[42:22] to us
[42:24] tonight and because he lives
[42:27] [Music]
[42:30] I Can Face
[42:35] Tomorrow yes because he
[42:39] [Music]
[42:41] lives all my fear is
[42:47] gone and because I
[42:51] [Music]
[42:53] know he holds my f
[42:57] [Music]
[42:59] future and life is worth the Living Just
[43:06] Because He
[43:10] Lives will God sing his
[43:16] son and they called him
[43:22] Jesus and he came to love

[48:14] Deuteronomy chapter 32 we want to say

[48:19] to you tonight uh just trust that the
[48:21] Lord will use us to be able to say
[48:23] something everybody say praise the Lord
[48:25] the Lord amen everybody glad to be here
[48:28] somebody got turkey on their mind or or
[48:31] Thanksgiving maybe banana pudding or or
[48:34] some type of pie but I want to come to
[48:36] feed on the word tonight amen just for a
[48:38] few minutes thank you sis I need that
[48:40] that's my cheat sheet Deuteronomy
[48:42] chapter 32 we want to look at verse 7 I
[48:45] want to read down just a few verses of
[48:47] scripture we'll be taking our subject
[48:49] out of verse 11 listen as as Moses is
[48:52] dealing here and he said remember the
[48:53] days of old consider the years of many
[48:57] Generations ask thy father and he will
[49:00] show thee thy elders and they will tell
[49:04] thee when the most high divided to the
[49:07] Nations their inheritance when he
[49:10] separated the sons of Adam he set the
[49:14] bounds of the people according to the
[49:17] number of the children of Israel for the
[49:21] Lord's portion I like this the Lord's
[49:25] portion is his people and Jacob is the
[49:29] lot of his inheritance he found him
[49:32] aren't you glad God can find you he
[49:36] found him in a desert land he found him
[49:40] in a desert land now watch he's using
[49:43] Jacob by typ from Prince and that he
[49:46] moves into his name and he says he found
[49:48] him in a desert land speaking concerning
[49:51] his people he found him in a desert land
[49:54] and in the waist of the Hing Wilderness
[49:57] he led him about he instructed him and
[50:01] he kept him as the apple of his eye as
[50:05] the eagle sareth up her nest look at
[50:09] this he's talking about Israel but then
[50:13] he says as an eagle stirreth up her nest
[50:17] fluth over her young spread abroad her
[50:22] wings taketh them and beareth them on
[50:27] her wings look at verse 11 again as an
[50:30] eagle stirreth up look at this word
[50:32] stirreth it means to stir up to cause to
[50:37] move to Rouse awake to awaken to Insight
[50:43] movement so what he wants to do with
[50:46] Israel is he wants to something to cause
[50:49] them and come among them as the eagle
[50:52] comes upon the nest he wants to awaken
[50:55] them or in exite them to
[50:58] movement so the Lord alone did lead him
[51:03] and there was no strange god with him
[51:06] once God converts Jacob and Jacob truly
[51:10] actually comes into an experience with
[51:12] God you never find another time in the
[51:14] scripture does he go out and begin to
[51:16] worship idols or pull in all the nations
[51:19] no sir there was no strange god with him
[51:22] and he made him to ride look at your
[51:24] Bible on the high plac look at verse 13
[51:28] he made him ride on the high places of
[51:31] the earth why not the Low Places because
[51:34] he Likens him to the eagle he made him
[51:36] to ride upon the high places of the
[51:39] earth that he might eat the increase of
[51:42] the fields and he made him to suck honey
[51:45] out of the Rock and oil out of the
[51:48] flinty rock Matthew
[51:51] 2428 is that not working up there
[51:54] Matthew 24:28 that's all right we'll
[51:55] preach with that
[51:57] wherefore wheresoever the carcass is
[52:00] there the Eagles will be gathered
[52:03] together may the Lord add His blessings
[52:05] to the word you can be seated
[52:08] tonight I was actually studying this
[52:12] subject that I'm going to preach on
[52:14] tonight whenever brother Matt had called
[52:16] me and after he had called me I had you
[52:19] on my heart and I thought that the Lord
[52:22] would if he ever give me an opportunity
[52:23] to preach to you again just as a local
[52:26] local body that I would take this
[52:28] subject so that's the reason why this is
[52:31] on my heart and I believe that God knows
[52:33] every person that's going to be here and
[52:35] every person that's not going to be here
[52:37] and I know that God is mindful to say
[52:39] something if it's just the one person I
[52:42] found out years ago I don't need to
[52:44] preach a sermon that's going to affect
[52:47] everybody in the church because I know
[52:48] that it's probably not going to I'm not
[52:50] that kind of a Preacher but if God can
[52:52] deal with one heart or one person I've
[52:55] drove 12 hours and 15 hours to preach to
[52:58] one person I felt like in that building
[53:00] but I'll tell you this I felt like that
[53:02] was worth my time because God concerned
[53:05] about everybody amen I want to speak to
[53:08] you tonight on as the eagle steareth up
[53:11] her nest and I want to take this as a
[53:15] type tonight and I want to actually look
[53:17] at the first place that the prophet
[53:19] started dealing with this whenever he
[53:21] was going to start preaching upon this
[53:24] these these Eagles and he'd been looking
[53:26] the Eagles and in that first message
[53:28] that he actually deals with the stories
[53:31] of the eagle he actually uses this as as
[53:34] as a principle for where he's going and
[53:37] he's going to pick it up from the
[53:38] scripture that we've read tonight and he
[53:41] said so the prophet here speaking about
[53:43] Deuteronomy 32 he said the prophet here
[53:46] is speaking he was talking of course
[53:49] principally he was speaking about Jacob
[53:52] how that there was no other God before
[53:55] him so he's talking talking about Jacob
[53:57] and how that Jacob become solded out to
[53:59] God and when he did there was no
[54:02] idolatry or no other God before him and
[54:05] he said see he knew no other God but as
[54:08] he said the eagle stirreth up her nest
[54:12] it is a time now listen to what this
[54:14] means on the eagle steering up its nest
[54:17] it's a time that when the eagle thinks
[54:19] that her little ones has matured enough
[54:22] and she's got to stir up the nest it's a
[54:26] time whenever the mother Eagle thinks
[54:29] that her little ones has matured enough
[54:32] that she's got to stir up the nest he
[54:35] said when we've got all settled down on
[54:38] something he said like it is what's God
[54:41] do he stirs up the nest again when we
[54:44] get settled down God stirs up the nest
[54:47] again he brought Martin Luther from
[54:50] Catholicism because they got so starchy
[54:53] that he had to stir up the nest and when
[54:56] he stirred up the nest he sent Wesley in
[54:59] and then Wesley got starchy and he
[55:02] stirred the nest and he sent Pentecost
[55:05] in and let me say this tonight it's Nest
[55:08] stirring time again because we get
[55:12] settled down now here is Moses in the
[55:15] scripture in the book of Deuteronomy and
[55:17] Moses is actually coming to the end of
[55:20] his ministry watch The Parallel tonight
[55:22] Moses coming to the end of his ministry
[55:25] and Moses mooses has been looking at
[55:27] Israel he's been noticing this and he's
[55:30] actually going to give this to them to
[55:32] warn them well now does Moses take and
[55:35] he's going to speak this to Israel is
[55:37] Israel going to give heed to the warning
[55:39] they are not are they going to take as
[55:41] it was in The Book of Daniel different
[55:43] places going to Babylon they are they're
[55:45] going to look at other Islands but
[55:46] notice the warning that God is going to
[55:49] give to them before they ever get there
[55:51] that God is going to use Moses and he's
[55:54] going to take the parallel of Jacob and
[55:57] he's going to use Jacob now remember
[55:59] that Jacob was the one who was actually
[56:02] taken going about his own way he wasn't
[56:05] concerned about God wasn't concerned
[56:06] about the things of God but then what's
[56:09] God takes and begins to lead Jacob that
[56:11] God's got to bring Jacob to the place
[56:14] that God can meet Jacob face to face and
[56:17] we know that whenever he crossed that
[56:19] Brook that night and once he comes
[56:21] across there and he leaves his family
[56:23] and his servants on the other side of
[56:25] the brook it was on that side of the
[56:27] brook that God began to move upon Jacob
[56:31] and then he tells Jacob you'll no longer
[56:33] be called Jacob but you're going to be
[56:35] called Prince now whenever Jacob gets to
[56:38] this he's going to call him Israel
[56:40] because that was going to be the name
[56:42] that God was going to use to be able to
[56:44] call his people by name he was going to
[56:47] call them Israel so when you read the
[56:50] Bible you'll find in one place talking
[56:52] about Jacob sometimes he calls him Jacob
[56:54] sometimes he calls him Prince some times
[56:56] he calls him Israel Israel eyes begin to
[56:59] DM as he was getting old and God's going
[57:01] to take that type of Jacob and then from
[57:04] Jacob the Patriarchs is going to come
[57:07] and then from there will be a people of
[57:09] God that he would call Israel now
[57:12] because Jacob was God's chosen vessel
[57:15] that God had actually allotted an
[57:18] inheritance to Jacob that Jacob was
[57:20] going to receive something from God and
[57:23] by top he's going to use Israel that
[57:25] Israel was going to come into Canaan
[57:27] they was going to have allotment or
[57:29] inheritance once they come into the land
[57:31] so they as we would say would be called
[57:33] of God they are chosen of God these are
[57:36] a people who has been LED they have been
[57:39] called out they have been separated from
[57:42] all kinds of things not just Egypt but
[57:44] remember even in the middle of the
[57:46] journey God had to constantly separate
[57:48] them from the many of the Nations that
[57:50] they found along the way so God has been
[57:53] with them God has been leading them but
[57:56] God wants to bring them to a place where
[57:58] he can give them their full inheritance
[58:01] to be able to divide the land one to
[58:03] another and because they are coming to
[58:05] that place that Moses picks it up and he
[58:08] says as it was you can remember as it
[58:11] was in the days of old you can remember
[58:14] how that God had been with them and that
[58:16] God had led them and then he brings it
[58:18] down to this place speaking about
[58:21] speaking about Jacob and he's going to
[58:23] take the top as an eagle stirreth up up
[58:26] his nest now God never wants his people
[58:29] to get to a place of complacency in
[58:32] their walk with God he never wants his
[58:34] people to get to a place where they get
[58:36] so settled down they're satisfied with
[58:39] what God has done they're satisfied with
[58:41] how God has moved they're satisfied I've
[58:43] repented I've I've been baptized I've
[58:45] done those things according to the word
[58:47] of God I have fulfilled that in the word
[58:50] and if we're not careful because that we
[58:52] have done those ordinances in the word
[58:54] remember there are certain ordinances
[58:56] that God puts in the word one of them is
[58:58] water baptism another one's paying their
[59:00] ties another one going to church another
[59:01] one foot washing communion those are
[59:04] things that God has required from us but
[59:06] if we're not careful whenever we look at
[59:08] the basic things that we do in
[59:10] Christianity and we think well I've
[59:12] repented I've been baptized I go to
[59:15] church I don't really do anything wrong
[59:17] listen we become so settled in the
[59:19] experience of what God has already done
[59:23] and when we get comfortable we stop
[59:25] reaching out when we get comfortable we
[59:27] stop reaching for more of God we stop
[59:29] reaching for more revelation we stop
[59:31] reaching for a deeper experience with
[59:33] God because we become complacent with
[59:35] what God has already done in our lives
[59:38] so what's God going to do when he finds
[59:40] us getting a little bit soft getting a
[59:42] little bit spiritually lazy a little bit
[59:45] complacent with what he's done I'll tell
[59:46] you what he does he stirs The Nest again
[59:50] he stirs The Nest again it is such a
[59:53] difficult day for us to be living it to
[59:56] think of what God has done for us in the
[59:58] book of the word think about what God
[1:00:00] has done for us that we realize that the
[1:00:03] book that I read from tonight that the
[1:00:05] majority of this book that I read from
[1:00:08] do you realize this book is not a
[1:00:10] mysterious book to us there's Millions
[1:00:12] across the world that it is a mysterious
[1:00:15] book but it's not a mysterious book to
[1:00:17] you even when it comes to the Book of
[1:00:19] Revelation do you realize that the
[1:00:21] majority of the Book of Revelation has
[1:00:24] already been fulfilled you got people
[1:00:26] all M waiting on this to happen the
[1:00:28] majority of the Book of Revelation has
[1:00:30] already come to pass it's already been
[1:00:33] fulfilled it's already finished and many
[1:00:35] don't even realize that it has but for
[1:00:38] you to whom the mystery has been made
[1:00:40] known to you your eyes has come open you
[1:00:43] understand what the first chapter
[1:00:45] represents the Sevenfold percentage of
[1:00:46] his deity you know chapter 2 chapter
[1:00:49] three represents the letters that
[1:00:51] whenever John would take and send them
[1:00:52] down to the churches which are in Asia
[1:00:55] which would be a spiritual type of the
[1:00:57] ages that's going to come and how that
[1:00:59] the condition on that church would be
[1:01:01] the condition upon the people and until
[1:01:03] you come all the way down to the L
[1:01:04] Odyssey and church age and then you
[1:01:06] leave there and go to Revelation chapter
[1:01:08] 4 and you find the throne room and one
[1:01:10] set upon the throne then you go to
[1:01:12] Revelation chapter 5 and you find a book
[1:01:14] in the right hand of him that set up on
[1:01:16] the throne and there was no man that was
[1:01:18] found worthy until one from the very
[1:01:20] Throne of God the heart of God Jesus
[1:01:23] Christ is the heart of God came forth to
[1:01:25] take the book out of the right hand of
[1:01:27] him that set upon the throne then you go
[1:01:29] to Revelation chapter 6 you got the
[1:01:30] seals Revelation chapter 7 there was
[1:01:33] silence in heaven about the space of a
[1:01:34] half hour then you go all the way down
[1:01:37] Revelation 10 Revelation 11 the two
[1:01:39] witnesses Revelation CH 12 Revelation
[1:01:41] chapter 13 which represents the Beast
[1:01:43] that comes forth out of the water which
[1:01:45] represents remember it came forth there
[1:01:47] was one that came out of the water
[1:01:48] another one came out of the land the one
[1:01:50] that came up out of the land was like a
[1:01:52] land which is the United States but I'll
[1:01:54] remind you it didn't remain a lamb it
[1:01:57] didn't remain a lamb it transformed
[1:02:00] itself from the lamb because that's what
[1:02:01] America has done those are not things
[1:02:04] that we're wondering about God's already
[1:02:06] revealed those things to us and it's
[1:02:08] already taking place right among us
[1:02:11] tonight and the church said amen but
[1:02:14] with all of that Revelation knowing who
[1:02:16] the man of sin is knowing what the
[1:02:18] future holds for the bride what God's
[1:02:20] called us to be if we're not careful we
[1:02:22] get so comfortable in teaching we've
[1:02:24] heard it we've heard it again the
[1:02:26] preacher comes out takes a text from the
[1:02:28] Bible and you think I've heard this I've
[1:02:31] heard this read before I've heard this
[1:02:32] preached on before I've heard these
[1:02:34] quotes I've heard it y but God knows
[1:02:36] there's times that we need to hear it
[1:02:38] again and what happens is we become so
[1:02:40] settled down until we put our fire our
[1:02:43] campfire down we put our Lantern up we
[1:02:46] got our tent set up and we become so
[1:02:48] setted in what God has done for us that
[1:02:51] we stop reaching higher to receive more
[1:02:53] of God I just preached to myself for the
[1:02:56] last 5 minutes we re High we we we
[1:02:58] realize that we are so complacent that
[1:03:01] we stop praying like we need to we stop
[1:03:03] reading our Bible like we need to we
[1:03:05] stop going to church like we need come
[1:03:07] on somebody preach with me dud what's
[1:03:09] God got to do force me to move I said
[1:03:12] there's times as a preacher that God has
[1:03:15] to force me to move he's got to force
[1:03:18] the issue in my life just like he does
[1:03:20] in your life and whenever he forces the
[1:03:23] issue you know what God does he allows
[1:03:25] me to get desperate sometimes he allows
[1:03:27] me to get to the place where I got to
[1:03:29] cry out and I get on my knees and
[1:03:31] there's times that I pray and my words
[1:03:33] feel like they leave my mouth and they
[1:03:35] fall right down on the ground what's it
[1:03:37] make me want to do cry out that much
[1:03:39] more it makes me want to cry out just
[1:03:41] that much why I want God to hear me it's
[1:03:44] not that God didn't hear it ain't a
[1:03:46] problem with God it's a problem with me
[1:03:49] I said it's a problem with me and God
[1:03:51] gets us to the place remember the
[1:03:53] prophet tells us that desperation caused
[1:03:56] for a subject because the Reason God
[1:03:58] does that is God never wants your walk
[1:04:01] to remain
[1:04:03] stagnant he never wants me to get to the
[1:04:06] place where my walk becomes stagnant
[1:04:09] because if it gets stagnant wiggle tails
[1:04:11] get in it and that's what happens to in
[1:04:13] experience so God does not allow you to
[1:04:16] get to the place as a Believer where
[1:04:18] your relationship is stagnant and I go
[1:04:20] to church and I go home and I go to work
[1:04:22] and I do this what is that that's just a
[1:04:24] cycle of life that's a cycle but I want
[1:04:27] to tell you you are not in the normal
[1:04:29] cycle like everybody else because when
[1:04:32] you come to church you're not coming to
[1:04:33] sit on a Pew you're not just coming to
[1:04:36] hear a man preach you're coming to leave
[1:04:38] this building you're coming to be caught
[1:04:40] up in the Heavenly places in Christ
[1:04:42] Jesus you're coming as Eagles to gather
[1:04:45] around the word of God and to start
[1:04:46] feeding upon it and it does something on
[1:04:49] the inside of you and something your
[1:04:50] heart wants to say Amen to it and glory
[1:04:53] to God praise the Lord what is it God
[1:04:55] stirs The
[1:04:57] Nest so when God stirs The Nest he wants
[1:05:01] to move the people from one thing to
[1:05:03] another he wants to move us as we would
[1:05:06] say from one step to another so we
[1:05:08] constantly are growing we're constantly
[1:05:10] maturing we're constantly getting closer
[1:05:12] to God he wants to move us think about
[1:05:14] it from one Glory as Paul called it he
[1:05:17] wants to move us from Glory unto Glory
[1:05:20] he wants to move us from one Plateau to
[1:05:22] a higher plateau and then to a higher
[1:05:24] Plateau why because he don't ever want
[1:05:26] you to feel like you
[1:05:28] arrived he don't want you to feel like
[1:05:30] well I arrived and I got all the
[1:05:32] Revelation I don't hear I don't really
[1:05:34] need that's that Spirit around the
[1:05:35] message today we don't need preachers no
[1:05:37] more all I need to do is sit around oh
[1:05:39] no you don't you need more the word
[1:05:41] right now than what you ever have been
[1:05:43] listen friends the closer we get to the
[1:05:45] coming of the lord we need to for the
[1:05:48] issue to be forced more now than what it
[1:05:50] ever has been before to make sure we are
[1:05:53] diligent about the things of God to make
[1:05:56] sure we're taking responsibility and do
[1:05:58] our part as a children of God Amen so
[1:06:02] God moves us from one thing to another
[1:06:04] why is it he never wants you to be
[1:06:07] considered Earthbound people Eagles are
[1:06:10] called to
[1:06:11] fly I said Eagles are called to fly God
[1:06:15] never tops you as earthy let's just be
[1:06:18] honest most of us got plenty of earthy
[1:06:22] yes sir my problem ain't the Earthly
[1:06:24] part my problem is I don't fly high
[1:06:26] enough the way I need to so what's God
[1:06:28] do God intervenes because he wants me to
[1:06:31] keep flying higher and higher and higher
[1:06:34] so what's God do he Likens us unto
[1:06:37] Eagles he will liken your life to any in
[1:06:40] Eagles absolutely incredible isin it
[1:06:42] amazing when you're going down the road
[1:06:44] and somebody says oh my goodness there's
[1:06:46] an eagle over there that everybody in
[1:06:47] the car everybody slows down and
[1:06:49] everybody's looking out the windows you
[1:06:50] know why they want to see that eagle why
[1:06:52] don't they do that with a buzzard why
[1:06:54] don't they do that with Crow why don't
[1:06:56] they do that with another bird I'll tell
[1:06:58] you why it's because e real eagles are
[1:07:01] rare I said real genuine Eagles is a
[1:07:05] rare thing and whenever you see one
[1:07:07] everybody wants to look at it because
[1:07:09] it's genuine and it's
[1:07:12] rare so God Likens his people to the
[1:07:16] Rarity of an eagle notice that job said
[1:07:19] it like this and job 39:27 do the
[1:07:23] eag mount up at thy command and make her
[1:07:29] nest on
[1:07:31] high the word there Mount up means does
[1:07:35] not the eagle Ascend up yeah or fly up I
[1:07:40] like this one to be lifted up it
[1:07:43] literally means do the eagle soar at his
[1:07:48] commands Amen on now think about that
[1:07:52] does an eagle soar at his command does
[1:07:57] the eagle Ascend up or does the eagle
[1:08:00] become lifted up by his command or I'll
[1:08:03] say it tonight does it not fly by his
[1:08:07] word in other words when we hear his
[1:08:09] word does not the eagle Ascend up why is
[1:08:13] it is because the eagle has been given
[1:08:16] this god-given ability that the eagle
[1:08:18] does not have to go somewhere to try to
[1:08:21] find its ability to fly remember it
[1:08:24] already has wing
[1:08:26] it already possesses every attribute
[1:08:28] that it needs to be able to fly the only
[1:08:31] thing it needs to do is is put its wings
[1:08:34] into action and that's where the church
[1:08:36] gets to if we become so Slumber and
[1:08:39] somber about the things of God remember
[1:08:41] God ain't trying to take you somewhere
[1:08:43] give you something external out here and
[1:08:45] there oh no what you got need of is
[1:08:47] already in you matter of fact I hear the
[1:08:49] prophet tell us he said everything that
[1:08:51] you need even for the Rapture is in you
[1:08:54] already everything that you need so
[1:08:57] God's not trying to give us something
[1:08:58] external everything we need is already
[1:09:01] in us what's it got to do put the wings
[1:09:04] into action notice Solomon said we
[1:09:07] should fly
[1:09:08] away as an eagle look at this Proverbs
[1:09:12] 30:19 the way of an eagle is in the
[1:09:17] air so you can identify the eagle notice
[1:09:21] how he identified him not by the ground
[1:09:24] he identif iing by the
[1:09:26] air in other words the manner the
[1:09:30] characteristics the attribute of an
[1:09:32] eagle is that he Soares upon the wind so
[1:09:35] he's carried up by the wind he sets his
[1:09:38] wings upon the wind oh my you realize
[1:09:41] that whenever an eagle takes do you
[1:09:43] realize that he only uses a very little
[1:09:46] percentage of flopping his wings about
[1:09:48] 90% of an eagle fly it's not him working
[1:09:53] or trying to achieve something are
[1:09:55] trying to Merit something but 90% of it
[1:09:58] is Grace he just knows how to set his
[1:10:01] wings upon the wind and the wind carries
[1:10:04] him higher and higher and higher amen do
[1:10:08] you realize that's the same thing with a
[1:10:10] Believer what's going to carries to the
[1:10:12] other side the grace of God to learn how
[1:10:14] to set our wings upon the word of God to
[1:10:17] allow it to be able to lift us up and to
[1:10:20] rise above to set us so high that it can
[1:10:23] carries above everything else Solomon
[1:10:25] said the way of an eagle is in the air
[1:10:28] not upon the ground not on not Earthly
[1:10:31] but in the air is the way of an eagle so
[1:10:34] when it comes to God's people he Likens
[1:10:37] them to
[1:10:38] Eagles notice that Moses is going to use
[1:10:42] this type that Moses is the first one to
[1:10:46] take this parallel and bring it together
[1:10:49] and he said you've seen what I did to
[1:10:51] the Egyptians and how I bear you
[1:10:55] I bear you I bear You On Eagle's Wings
[1:11:01] and brought you into myself which tells
[1:11:04] me this if God bore me if he bore me
[1:11:09] that means Papa eagle or Mama Eagle took
[1:11:12] me on his wings and I couldn't get out
[1:11:15] of Egypt by myself I couldn't get out of
[1:11:18] sin by myself I couldn't get out of
[1:11:20] bondage by myself so what God did is God
[1:11:23] came down into our bondage watch the typ
[1:11:26] that Moses is showing what Christ is
[1:11:28] going to do I came down right among you
[1:11:31] you couldn't get out of it by yourself
[1:11:32] you couldn't get out of Egypt by
[1:11:34] yourself you've been there over 400
[1:11:36] years and you become complacent and you
[1:11:38] become settled down and you got used to
[1:11:41] being there so what did Mama Eagle do
[1:11:43] Mama come right down among them and he
[1:11:45] said I've been watching you I've been
[1:11:47] right there with you and how I bore you
[1:11:49] in the wings of
[1:11:50] eagles God Likens his church to Eagles
[1:11:57] amen but I want to tell you this you do
[1:12:00] not have the ability to soar
[1:12:04] alone I said it takes the wind
[1:12:06] underneath you to give you the ability
[1:12:09] to soar amen now notice he's telling
[1:12:13] them if you will notice I was with you I
[1:12:17] you seen what I did you notice I was
[1:12:19] with you I protected you I kept you they
[1:12:22] wanted to destroy you they wanted to
[1:12:24] work you to death but I bore you on the
[1:12:26] wings of an
[1:12:28] eagle here's your favorite scripture but
[1:12:31] they that wait upon the Lord he shall
[1:12:36] renew their strength they
[1:12:39] shall Ascend up be lifted up to soar to
[1:12:44] soar
[1:12:46] above to soar over or as we say overcome
[1:12:51] so you shall Mount up with wings how as
[1:12:55] Eagles so God Likens you to an eagle you
[1:12:59] cannot listen God's the one that compels
[1:13:02] you there ain't man that called you to
[1:13:03] be an eagle a man didn't have that kind
[1:13:05] of Revelation but God says if you'll
[1:13:07] wait upon me if a man will just simply
[1:13:10] wait upon the Lord I'll give him the
[1:13:12] strength to fly I'll give him the
[1:13:14] strength to overcome amen if you lose
[1:13:16] your joy somewhere I'll help you get
[1:13:18] your joy back if you lose your Victory
[1:13:20] somewhere I'll help you get your Victory
[1:13:22] back if you'll just wait upon me don't
[1:13:24] get too nervous don't get too upset
[1:13:26] don't get too wound up just wait upon
[1:13:29] the Lord and He Shall renew thy strength
[1:13:32] what a promise that if I get weak in the
[1:13:35] journey he'll renew
[1:13:37] it you know what the word renew comes
[1:13:39] from
[1:13:41] restore so in somewhere in the middle of
[1:13:43] the journey if you feel like you fail
[1:13:45] somewhere God has restoration power he
[1:13:48] can restore you back from what you fell
[1:13:50] from and over and over again tonight I
[1:13:53] could go through so many different
[1:13:54] places where the scripture teaches us
[1:13:56] that God Likens himself to Eagles and he
[1:13:58] Likens his people unto Eagles because
[1:14:00] there's something oh in there though in
[1:14:03] there's something about watching an
[1:14:04] eagle soar that moves us you ever been
[1:14:06] anywhere seeing Eagle take off oh my it
[1:14:09] moves us it pulls us it motivates us
[1:14:12] there's something about a soar and Eagle
[1:14:15] that speaks to something on the inside
[1:14:16] of us when you look at it on a calendar
[1:14:18] or a picture somewhere and that eagle is
[1:14:21] soaring and there's mountains Underneath
[1:14:22] Him and the clouds are Underneath Him
[1:14:24] the something about the eagle that moves
[1:14:29] us
[1:14:30] nobody nobody wants to be lacking into a
[1:14:35] chicken that don't even make me feel
[1:14:37] good nobody wants to scratch
[1:14:40] around amen upon the ground nobody wants
[1:14:45] to Peck around the ground come on but I
[1:14:47] remind you a chicken's a bird too well
[1:14:51] ain't I preaching this in the right
[1:14:52] Church a chicken's a bird too
[1:14:55] he's got Wings he's got a beak come on
[1:15:00] he's got something he can walk on but
[1:15:02] let me tell you about a chicken he's not
[1:15:04] designed with the attributes to
[1:15:09] SAR a chicken Oh Glory a chicken's
[1:15:12] allotment or inheritance is not in
[1:15:15] Heavenly places amen a chicken is not
[1:15:19] called to fly into the heavens that is
[1:15:21] not his allotment in life that is not
[1:15:23] his inheritance God did not liken Israel
[1:15:26] unto a chicken oh no he Likens them unto
[1:15:30] an eagle remember a chicken is a bird
[1:15:33] but he's a bird that is limited he is a
[1:15:35] bird that is he cannot fly very long he
[1:15:38] cannot stay over here my he cannot stay
[1:15:41] lifted very long he's up one day and
[1:15:43] down the next up one day and down the
[1:15:45] next that's what a all but not an eagle
[1:15:48] an eagle has amen has the ability to
[1:15:51] soar upon the
[1:15:53] heavens no true believer wants to be a
[1:15:56] limited
[1:15:58] believer amen no believer wants to be
[1:16:02] confined to the ground no believer wants
[1:16:04] to be limited to the ground oh no not
[1:16:07] when you're called to sword why would
[1:16:09] you want to stay on the ground if you're
[1:16:11] called a sword into the
[1:16:13] heavens so he says Mount up Mount up
[1:16:18] Paul actually commissions the church and
[1:16:21] the book of Ephesians and he said
[1:16:23] blessed be the god in father of our Lord
[1:16:26] Jesus Christ who have blessed us with
[1:16:30] all what spiritual
[1:16:32] blessings but where is the spiritual
[1:16:35] blessings located at
[1:16:38] in so you mean to tell me to get it if I
[1:16:42] want all spiritual blessings I got to
[1:16:44] get in Heavenly places if I want
[1:16:47] everything from the Earth from from God
[1:16:49] I got to get to where God's going to
[1:16:51] give it to me at and he said he has
[1:16:53] called us and bless us with all
[1:16:55] spiritual blessings in Heavenly places
[1:16:58] the believer's position is not Earthly
[1:17:01] places it's not ground places but it's
[1:17:05] Heavenly places in Christ that's what we
[1:17:07] are called to but believer is called to
[1:17:10] Heavenly height they're called to fly
[1:17:12] that's where they're blessed at so if
[1:17:15] I'm blessed in Heavenly places then I'm
[1:17:17] not blessed in Earthly
[1:17:19] places that's the position God has
[1:17:22] elected the church to in Heavenly places
[1:17:26] the allotment of an eagle the
[1:17:27] inheritance of an eagle is Heavenly
[1:17:30] places and the church said now let's
[1:17:33] just be honest a
[1:17:36] minute there's an eagle in
[1:17:39] me that loves to
[1:17:42] soar but I got to be honest there's also
[1:17:46] a hippo in me that likes to wall in the
[1:17:51] mud and nobody says a word
[1:17:55] yeah there's a part of us that likes to
[1:17:59] be lifted up but then there's a part of
[1:18:02] me that gets down sometimes I'll say
[1:18:05] amen for you it amazes me that when God
[1:18:09] calls an individual and that God
[1:18:12] actually ordains a person and he elects
[1:18:15] them to be an eagle but he calls you to
[1:18:18] SAR and if you're called to SAR no
[1:18:21] matter how much you w in the mud like a
[1:18:23] hippo one day God will make sure you'll
[1:18:26] fulfill what he's called you to be if
[1:18:29] God has allotted you to be an eagle you
[1:18:32] can only wallow so long you can only sit
[1:18:35] on the ground so long I ain't asking you
[1:18:37] about this I'm telling you what God's
[1:18:39] called you to be if God has made that
[1:18:42] year in hell I'll think you may be the
[1:18:44] one the bride's even waiting on that
[1:18:46] God's going to make sure if that is your
[1:18:48] orain inheritance as a Son of God sooner
[1:18:51] or later God's going to shake everything
[1:18:53] off of you and you're going to find
[1:18:55] yourself soaring in the heavens let me
[1:18:57] just say it like this Jacob was not
[1:18:59] called to be a shocker Jacob was not
[1:19:01] called to be a deceiver he was called to
[1:19:04] be a prince over Israel Moses was not
[1:19:06] called to be a prince of Egypt he was
[1:19:09] called to be a prophet of God he wasn't
[1:19:11] called to be a man oh my to be able to
[1:19:14] bind Man In Chains but Moses was called
[1:19:16] to be a chain breaker amen amen Moses
[1:19:20] was not called to bind man he was called
[1:19:22] to Free Man he wants over them as the
[1:19:25] mother would her brood and he sees him
[1:19:28] he wasn't called to bind another man he
[1:19:30] was called to liberate all
[1:19:33] Man David wasn't called to be a
[1:19:36] Shepherd over just his daddy sheep he
[1:19:40] was called to
[1:19:41] fly and to be a king over Israel amen oh
[1:19:47] I thank God I'll say it again he wasn't
[1:19:49] just called to be an Earthly shepherd He
[1:19:52] was called To Be A Heavenly Shepherd let
[1:19:55] me tell you you was not called to be
[1:19:57] ordinary you was not called just to be
[1:20:00] another worker you was not called just
[1:20:02] to punch another time clock you was not
[1:20:04] called just to come to this world and
[1:20:06] just to be another person that lives
[1:20:07] their time oh no that's what Ordinary
[1:20:10] People do but I want to tell you're not
[1:20:12] called to be ordinary you're called to
[1:20:14] be extraordinary you're called to be an
[1:20:17] extraordinary
[1:20:18] people
[1:20:20] amen God would not allow us as his
[1:20:23] church to be con settled complacent or
[1:20:27] looking back at what God did
[1:20:30] yesterday is't that amazing it's the
[1:20:33] nature of man the prophet tells us he's
[1:20:36] always thanking God for what he did and
[1:20:39] he's always looking for what God's going
[1:20:41] to do but he's missing what God's doing
[1:20:43] right now and what happens if man looks
[1:20:46] back oh watch that Spirit of a thought
[1:20:48] if he looks back too long and he looks
[1:20:50] back at what God did he it limits him to
[1:20:53] the place to where he becomes satisfied
[1:20:56] because of God moved God spoke God did
[1:20:58] this and he becomes satisfied what is
[1:21:00] that doing settling for a past
[1:21:02] experience don't you see that it's been
[1:21:05] something in the mind of God that's what
[1:21:07] every denomination has done that's
[1:21:09] exactly what every organization every
[1:21:11] great organization that has come that's
[1:21:13] what they done they look back at what
[1:21:15] God did and they rallied around that and
[1:21:17] rallied around that and they want to
[1:21:19] bring everybody back to what God did or
[1:21:21] how God moved I want to tell you friends
[1:21:23] you can go to the tomb over in Israel
[1:21:26] you can look at it 500 times but it does
[1:21:28] not stop the message that he is not
[1:21:30] there but he's risen from the dead we
[1:21:33] cannot live sitting in front of the Tomb
[1:21:35] we cannot just look back and go to
[1:21:37] Jeffersonville and look at the tomb and
[1:21:39] think about the tomb oh no doubt it's a
[1:21:41] wonderful place but let me tell you
[1:21:43] something greater than that too the
[1:21:44] message that that man preach is still
[1:21:47] alive tonight it's T man it's
[1:21:49] tabernacled in human bodies and there's
[1:21:51] a people here that is soaring on that
[1:21:53] message they' come around the carcass of
[1:21:56] the world and they fed upon it it gives
[1:21:58] them strength to be able to
[1:22:02] fly this all
[1:22:04] right we're not like the
[1:22:06] chickens amen chickens are content in
[1:22:10] barnyards chickens are settled in
[1:22:12] barnards they got Barnyard ways Barnyard
[1:22:16] cultures Barnyard life come on they're
[1:22:19] content with eating bugs they're content
[1:22:21] with eating fleas they're content with
[1:22:23] eating lies amen we're not chickens and
[1:22:26] neither are we buzzards buzzards Circle
[1:22:29] dead things if you want to know what
[1:22:31] died just find the
[1:22:35] Buzzard they Circle things that is dead
[1:22:38] they Circle things that is lifeless they
[1:22:40] Circle things that used to have movement
[1:22:43] used to have action I need somebody to
[1:22:45] help me things that is dead from
[1:22:47] yesterday we are not called to be Bard
[1:22:50] and neither are we called to be vultur
[1:22:52] we're not like a vulture that's looking
[1:22:54] for an easy meal on the side of the road
[1:22:56] oh no God said you are like an unto an
[1:22:59] eagle you are called to soar you are
[1:23:01] called to be lifted up and Ascend up
[1:23:04] into the
[1:23:06] heavens Hallelujah you remember the
[1:23:09] prophet talking about that eagle in
[1:23:10] Cincinnati Zoo up in Cincinnati Ohio
[1:23:13] there ain't never a time that I don't
[1:23:14] cross under that bridge it's got the
[1:23:16] name Cincinnati and you go past it
[1:23:17] you'll see a sign it says Cincinnati Zoo
[1:23:19] when I go by there and see that sign I
[1:23:21] always think of that story that the
[1:23:23] prophet said he took his family ENT to
[1:23:24] that zoo and he saw that eagle in that
[1:23:27] inside of that
[1:23:28] cage and he said he looked at that eagle
[1:23:31] as that eagle listen to me he would run
[1:23:34] as hard as he could run he would flop
[1:23:37] his wings as hard as he could flop them
[1:23:40] but whenever he would take off he would
[1:23:42] run against the bars and fall right back
[1:23:44] down and when he would fall down the
[1:23:46] prophet said he'd knock another feather
[1:23:48] off of it and another feather off of it
[1:23:50] and the prophet said there was something
[1:23:52] in that eagle he said inside of that
[1:23:54] cage he would look up into that blue sky
[1:23:56] and there was something about that blue
[1:23:58] sky that actually was speaking to an
[1:24:00] attribute of the eagle on the inside of
[1:24:02] him and he know that's where he belonged
[1:24:04] at that's that he know that's where I'm
[1:24:06] supposed to be at so he tried over and
[1:24:09] over again but the harder he tried the
[1:24:12] more he
[1:24:17] fail I said the harder he tried the more
[1:24:20] he fail so his life was in a fallen
[1:24:24] condition right yes sir yes sir and he
[1:24:26] only fell more because he was trying he
[1:24:29] was trying to get out he was trying to
[1:24:32] be lifted up he was trying to be raised
[1:24:34] up and the prophet said oh I love that
[1:24:37] the prophet said oh my if I only had a
[1:24:40] key to that cage yes sir I say an eagle
[1:24:44] looking at an eagle an eagle looking at
[1:24:47] an eagle and that eagle on the outside
[1:24:50] thought if I only had the key to that
[1:24:52] cage I would unlock that door and I
[1:24:55] would let him go if I only had the key
[1:24:58] in other words if I had the key I would
[1:25:00] restore the eagle back to where he's
[1:25:03] called to if I had the ability to renew
[1:25:06] him if I had the ability to restore him
[1:25:09] I would open up the cage oh friends
[1:25:11] don't you see what God has done in this
[1:25:13] last age that God has sent us a prophet
[1:25:16] an eagle with a key of Revelation that
[1:25:18] has taken and unlocked the door of
[1:25:21] denominationalism and organization to do
[1:25:23] what so you you can raise up into the
[1:25:25] sphere into the allotment of your
[1:25:27] inheritance that God has called you to
[1:25:29] that's what this message has done it is
[1:25:31] not made us more Earthly it has not made
[1:25:34] us settle it has called us to the
[1:25:38] heavens absolutely you
[1:25:41] realize if you lock up an eagle too long
[1:25:44] he can literally lose his identity of
[1:25:46] who he
[1:25:48] is amen if you lock him up too long he
[1:25:52] becomes dependent they say on his
[1:25:53] handlers yes
[1:25:55] sir he becomes dependent on easy
[1:26:00] things feel my preacher coming on he
[1:26:03] becomes dependent on what's handed to
[1:26:06] him what's GI to him besides fighting
[1:26:10] for the real desire on the
[1:26:12] inside a zoo had an eagle locked
[1:26:15] up and the handlers went out there and
[1:26:18] took the key and unlocked the cage and
[1:26:21] that eagle took when he seen the door
[1:26:23] open
[1:26:24] he hopped outside of that door and he
[1:26:27] got there on the ground and on the
[1:26:29] ground he began to look around and he
[1:26:31] started hop it around a little bit and
[1:26:33] after just a few
[1:26:35] minutes after just a few minutes he
[1:26:38] hopped back into the
[1:26:39] cage do you know why because he lost his
[1:26:44] identity of who he
[1:26:46] was he went out and went right back in
[1:26:50] oh couldn't we preach there tonight he
[1:26:52] went out and went went right back in he
[1:26:56] went out and right back in hey come in
[1:26:59] go right back out go out come right back
[1:27:01] in what is it we haven't realized the
[1:27:04] responsibility of what we're called to
[1:27:06] be the longer we are dependent upon the
[1:27:09] handlers and the Flesh and the hands of
[1:27:12] what's given to us what's told to us the
[1:27:15] way you should be how you should be what
[1:27:17] you should preach what you should teach
[1:27:18] you become dependent upon those things
[1:27:20] and you remain EarthBound
[1:27:24] oh my what happened is he got
[1:27:27] comfortable in the
[1:27:28] cage may we never get there I say may we
[1:27:32] never get to may we never be so
[1:27:34] restricted from the heavens may we never
[1:27:36] get so bound upon the Earth may we never
[1:27:39] get so comfortable in time that we
[1:27:41] forget what God has called us to be do
[1:27:44] you realize David was called to be a
[1:27:47] giant
[1:27:48] slayer he was called to slay Giants
[1:27:51] that's what he's called to be that's
[1:27:53] what he's anointed to be that's what God
[1:27:55] showed him to be but what if David would
[1:27:57] have never went down to the battle come
[1:27:59] on what if David would have stayed in
[1:28:02] the nest what if David would have stayed
[1:28:04] home what if David would said Daddy I
[1:28:06] don't feel like going down there send
[1:28:07] somebody else send one of the servants
[1:28:09] down there but I want to tell you David
[1:28:11] could have never fulfilled what God had
[1:28:12] called him to be but to prove that there
[1:28:14] was something in David the prophet said
[1:28:16] that David could not wait to go see the
[1:28:19] battle he could not wait to go down do
[1:28:21] you know why there was something in
[1:28:23] David that was called to be a warrior
[1:28:24] and he was tired of sitting around
[1:28:26] Daddy's nest and looking at Daddy's
[1:28:28] house and feeding from Daddy's table
[1:28:30] he's ready to go down there fulfill the
[1:28:32] allotment that God has ordained David to
[1:28:34] be where's David need to be at on the
[1:28:37] battlefield think of the obstacles that
[1:28:40] David had to
[1:28:41] overcome think about it think of the
[1:28:44] things David had to overcome just to get
[1:28:46] on the
[1:28:48] battlefield everything tried to
[1:28:49] discourage David his brothers tried to
[1:28:52] discourage him his king tried to
[1:28:55] discourage him goli tried to discourage
[1:28:57] him fear tried to stop him reason tried
[1:29:01] to stop him can I say Common
[1:29:05] Sense try to stop him because to the
[1:29:08] human eye this battle looks absolutely
[1:29:13] impossible Israel's Army David's
[1:29:17] Brothers David's King amen David's King
[1:29:22] was looking at David through Earthly
[1:29:26] eyes amen and as long as you look at
[1:29:30] other people and as long as you look at
[1:29:32] yourself through Earthly eyes you'll see
[1:29:35] the same thing David's brothers did they
[1:29:38] was looking at David and they thinking
[1:29:39] oh my poor little B old David that great
[1:29:43] big giant but David was not looking
[1:29:45] through human eyes he was looking
[1:29:47] through the eyes of an eagle amen he was
[1:29:50] not appearing Through The Eyes of his
[1:29:52] brother he was not appearing Through The
[1:29:53] Eyes of Saul he was looking through
[1:29:55] God's eyes and through God's eyes what
[1:29:57] my sle think about whenever you talk
[1:29:59] about perspective and point of view do
[1:30:01] you read us to a to a mountain to an
[1:30:04] eagle is just a little bitty heel it's
[1:30:06] what perspective you're looking at it
[1:30:08] and whenever David look at the giant
[1:30:10] David knew he was called David knew he
[1:30:12] was chosen and David knew that God was
[1:30:14] watching over Israel and that God would
[1:30:16] bear up Israel in the wings of an eagle
[1:30:18] what would God do to his people on the
[1:30:20] battlefield that's standing for his name
[1:30:22] standing for his word standing for his
[1:30:24] people will not God bear them
[1:30:27] up absolutely come on David's higher
[1:30:30] calling was
[1:30:31] higher he could have never been God's
[1:30:35] Overcomer as long as he was Daddy's
[1:30:39] Shepherd
[1:30:40] hallelujah amen amen amen he would have
[1:30:45] never been God's Overcomer had he
[1:30:47] remained in Daddy's
[1:30:49] Nest can I ask you a question why would
[1:30:53] God put David that kind of
[1:30:55] danger why would God put David in that
[1:30:59] kind of danger I'll tell you why he
[1:31:01] could cuz David was just as safe in
[1:31:04] front of Goliath as he was in the
[1:31:07] backyard he was just as safe I want to
[1:31:10] tell you Daddy was watching over him the
[1:31:13] eagle was watching over him Oh my he was
[1:31:16] just as safe in front of a a Philistine
[1:31:18] he was just in safe as front of Israel's
[1:31:20] Army and Israel's enemy as he was if he
[1:31:23] was sitting at his Daddy's table and I
[1:31:25] could go on tonight and time would fail
[1:31:27] me to tell you how that Moses had to
[1:31:29] leave the Wilderness of his
[1:31:31] father-in-law's house and go down to the
[1:31:33] judgments of Egypt Joseph had to leave
[1:31:35] the security of Daddy's house and he
[1:31:37] ended up in pontier prison Daniel went
[1:31:40] from the pen housee to the Lion's
[1:31:43] Den amen Esther went from her uncle's
[1:31:47] house right into a place of murder and
[1:31:49] deceit and lies Ruth Ruth went from her
[1:31:54] Homeland where everything was common and
[1:31:56] she knew everybody and everybody knew
[1:31:58] her but God moves her from there to
[1:32:01] wherever a place bass caner do you know
[1:32:03] why God stirs up the nest let me quit
[1:32:07] God stirs at the nest God tells us right
[1:32:11] from the start of the book I'm going to
[1:32:13] deal with my people the way that an
[1:32:14] eagle does do you realize how profound
[1:32:18] an eagle is they are so unique an
[1:32:22] eagle's wingspan can be up to 9 foot
[1:32:25] wide his eyesight is so King he can see
[1:32:30] a rabbit in the middle of the night over
[1:32:32] a mile
[1:32:34] away poor
[1:32:36] rabbit think spiritual an eagle has
[1:32:40] incredible
[1:32:41] Vision when it's dark to every other
[1:32:44] bird and every other Bird's vision would
[1:32:47] be limited the eagle can see further
[1:32:50] than any other bird he can see higher
[1:32:53] than any other the bird he can see his
[1:32:55] prey quicker listen he can fire quicker
[1:32:58] he can get there faster he can see it
[1:33:00] further than any other bird do you
[1:33:04] realize that when an eagle mates people
[1:33:07] who's liking to Eagles when an eagle
[1:33:10] mates he mates for
[1:33:17] life they literally mate till death do
[1:33:21] them part
[1:33:24] amen and when an eagle
[1:33:27] mates they don't even mate on the
[1:33:29] ground but an eagle actually Soares High
[1:33:33] into the air and when he finds his mate
[1:33:36] Hallelujah they go into a dance in the
[1:33:40] middle of the air when they see their
[1:33:42] mate yeah come on and they do this dance
[1:33:46] in the middle of the air oh my and when
[1:33:49] they do that's where think about it
[1:33:51] their offspring is conceived in the
[1:33:55] air they come from the heavens they soar
[1:33:58] into the heavens they meet their spouse
[1:34:01] in the heavens they mate in the heavens
[1:34:04] she conceives in Heavenly
[1:34:08] places Hallelujah think about it they
[1:34:11] come from the heavens they're conceived
[1:34:13] in the heavens they are born upon the
[1:34:15] Earth but as soon as they get off the
[1:34:17] Earth they go back to where they come
[1:34:21] from and may I say all of God God's
[1:34:23] Eagles are born the same
[1:34:25] way amen that tells me listen if that
[1:34:29] tells me if an eagle is conceiving in
[1:34:32] the middle of the air you don't have to
[1:34:34] worry about an eagle cohabitating with a
[1:34:36] chicken come
[1:34:38] on that's right you don't have to worry
[1:34:42] about him cohabitating with a chicken in
[1:34:44] the barnyard come on or a buzzard or any
[1:34:48] other Bird eagles do not crossbreed
[1:34:53] there's a lot of other species that
[1:34:58] does and we'll sa that sermon for the
[1:35:01] pastor but not Eagles Eagles do not
[1:35:05] crossbreed you may crossbreed a dog you
[1:35:08] may crossbreed a horse and you may
[1:35:10] crossbreed a crowd but never an eagle in
[1:35:14] order to mate with an eagle you know
[1:35:17] what you got to be an
[1:35:19] eagle
[1:35:21] amen could we not learn could the Young
[1:35:23] people not learn something tonight from
[1:35:26] an eagle the prophet says under no
[1:35:28] circumstance should a Believer marry an
[1:35:31] unbeliever I ain't apologizing that's
[1:35:33] the message is just as good as anybody
[1:35:35] else sir under no circumstance you know
[1:35:37] what that you know why he says that is
[1:35:39] because he knows that Eagles will
[1:35:41] produce Eagles Eagles will stay with
[1:35:43] anybody know what I'm talking about yes
[1:35:46] sir does anybody know what you call
[1:35:48] female eagle think about this you call a
[1:35:50] cow you got a cow right and then you got
[1:35:53] a deer he's a a buck and then he's a doe
[1:35:55] you got a bull you got a heer you got a
[1:35:57] donkey there's a jack she's called a
[1:35:59] Jenny you got chickens one's called a
[1:36:01] rooster one's called a a hen right but
[1:36:04] anybody know what you call have you ever
[1:36:06] looked this up you ever looked this up
[1:36:08] how powerful this is do you know what
[1:36:09] you call a female eagle let me tell you
[1:36:12] an eagle amen it's Mr and Mrs
[1:36:18] Eagle yes sir on you don't call her
[1:36:22] something different from him you don't
[1:36:24] identify her something different from
[1:36:26] him she has identified with his name
[1:36:29] she's identified with his ways she's
[1:36:31] identified with his wings she's
[1:36:33] identified with who he is every
[1:36:35] attribute that he has she has she is
[1:36:38] identified with him they are Mr and M
[1:36:41] Eagle that's why the prophet tells us in
[1:36:43] the message rising of the sun he said
[1:36:45] she's bone of his bone flesh of his
[1:36:46] flesh she is him misss Jesus
[1:36:52] Christ and God say say I want to tell
[1:36:54] you I'm going to deal with you the way
[1:36:56] an eagle does his
[1:36:58] young you realize when an eagle builds
[1:37:00] its nest it never builds the nest on the
[1:37:03] ground it's never built at eye level
[1:37:07] Hallelujah they build it in high places
[1:37:10] so if you're going to build a
[1:37:13] church I mean if you're wanting to raise
[1:37:15] Eagles set them as high as you can die
[1:37:18] high they build upon the high places the
[1:37:21] Bible said they mounted up with Wings
[1:37:24] upon the high they establish themselves
[1:37:26] in the heaven they soar upon the heavens
[1:37:30] amen and when that little eaglet is
[1:37:32] hatched out in this nest and he's born
[1:37:35] up in that Cliff of the rock or Heavenly
[1:37:37] places you realize he don't view things
[1:37:40] the way chickens do that's born on the
[1:37:41] Earth whenever he's born and he gets to
[1:37:44] the place where he can look over the
[1:37:46] nest he views it from Heavenly
[1:37:49] places now you ain't with me I'll tell
[1:37:51] you what I'm saying though when you get
[1:37:52] born again and you start looking at the
[1:37:55] world and you start looking at the Earth
[1:37:57] you don't view it the way that you used
[1:37:59] to view it but you view it from Heavenly
[1:38:01] places you don't look at things the same
[1:38:03] you don't look at one another the same
[1:38:05] you don't look at nothing the same you
[1:38:06] know why it's where you're borned
[1:38:09] at you see it from an elevated place or
[1:38:13] an elevated position amen I don't care
[1:38:16] what family you come out of or what your
[1:38:17] last name is when you get born again you
[1:38:20] look at things different when you get
[1:38:21] born again you don't View the same way
[1:38:24] you used to Paul said he has raised us
[1:38:27] up together and has made us to sit in
[1:38:30] Heavenly places
[1:38:32] born do you realize before a mother
[1:38:35] Eagle how many beli in
[1:38:38] predestination before a mother eagle
[1:38:41] ever lays her
[1:38:43] eggs she's already got a place prepared
[1:38:48] amen before they're ever born she don't
[1:38:52] oh my goodness I'm fixing have some egg
[1:38:53] I I need to place but notice she's
[1:38:55] already working on the
[1:38:58] nest I said she's already making a place
[1:39:01] for them to dwell at
[1:39:04] amen think about it so she's already
[1:39:06] making ready for the new
[1:39:09] birth before it ever
[1:39:13] happens so she's getting ready she
[1:39:15] builds this nest in the high places
[1:39:17] Eagle's Nest can be around 7t in
[1:39:20] diameter and the eagle builds the nest
[1:39:23] out of sticks and Limbs and thistles and
[1:39:25] Thorns yeah I said it right don't miss
[1:39:28] that she builds it out of sticks and
[1:39:31] Limbs and thistles Bramble brush Thorns
[1:39:37] yes sir so the nest itself is a
[1:39:40] collection of
[1:39:41] branches that Mama eagle and papa eagle
[1:39:44] has picked up so you can tell where the
[1:39:48] eagle has
[1:39:50] been by the branches that makes up the
[1:39:52] nest of Alla the branches is a
[1:39:55] historical
[1:39:57] record of all of where he's come
[1:40:01] from you see what I'm saying sir so he's
[1:40:04] been preparing a place he's been making
[1:40:07] a place so it records the journey that
[1:40:10] she's been in this field and she's been
[1:40:12] in this field and she's been in this
[1:40:14] field and look at here here she comes
[1:40:16] and she's got a bunch of thorns you know
[1:40:18] why that's showing where she's come from
[1:40:20] are you hearing me tonight the thorns
[1:40:22] and the sticks is a testimony of where
[1:40:24] she's been what she's been through what
[1:40:26] she's had to
[1:40:29] overcome that's how you got here you
[1:40:31] would listen it shows you how that she
[1:40:34] has overcome to get you to a place where
[1:40:38] you can be born
[1:40:40] again come on somebody she gathers
[1:40:43] sticks and thorns and when she gathers
[1:40:46] them together she don't just come and
[1:40:48] lay them down oh no she actually places
[1:40:51] the sticks
[1:40:53] in the place think about this She lays
[1:40:57] them in
[1:40:59] order amen amen She lays them in order
[1:41:03] and she strategically places the sharp
[1:41:06] or the pointed ends of the stick she
[1:41:09] puts them in the nest where they're
[1:41:10] pointed
[1:41:12] out and then she takes the thorns and
[1:41:15] she puts it around the nest to where
[1:41:17] they're pointed out all right do you
[1:41:19] know why because she knows that enem is
[1:41:23] going to try to get her born again
[1:41:28] eaglets so she builds the
[1:41:30] nest as a place of Refuge a place of
[1:41:35] safety do you realize that a line will
[1:41:38] not cross
[1:41:41] Thorns I've been in Africa I've been
[1:41:44] there in the in safaris and you watch in
[1:41:47] Africa the Thorns are really really long
[1:41:50] in Africa and if you're going to go out
[1:41:52] in Africa at night and and you want to
[1:41:53] put up your tents if you're out on on on
[1:41:55] a on a walk and you're you're you want
[1:41:57] to make sure that the the lies can't get
[1:41:59] you so you want to know which way
[1:42:00] they're coming from what you do is you
[1:42:03] put the thorns on the back side of
[1:42:06] you or the weak side that way you can't
[1:42:10] be attacked from a blind spot because a
[1:42:13] line will not cross the
[1:42:15] Thorns are you hearing me but thank God
[1:42:20] we had a line that came down to Earth
[1:42:24] and this line crossed the thorns and
[1:42:27] waited into the thorns and took the
[1:42:29] Thorns so that you can be born
[1:42:34] again yes sir so she puts the thorns on
[1:42:37] the outside Mountain line won't cross
[1:42:39] the Thorns Bobcats won't cross the
[1:42:42] Thorns because it's the protection of
[1:42:44] that eagle she wants nothing thanks
[1:42:47] spiritual nothing can get around the
[1:42:49] Thorns do you realize think spiritually
[1:42:53] the only way the only way that you can
[1:42:57] be around the Thorns is you got to be
[1:42:59] born on the right
[1:43:01] side if you're born on the right side
[1:43:04] you don't have to worry about the Thorns
[1:43:06] they've already been bore for you if
[1:43:08] you're born if you're born on the right
[1:43:10] side you don't have to worry about the
[1:43:11] sticks protruding out you're born on the
[1:43:13] right
[1:43:15] side so the eagle
[1:43:17] hatches and something takes place that
[1:43:19] is so crucial whenever the eaglet is
[1:43:22] born born do you realize and this is the
[1:43:24] same with a lot of different animals you
[1:43:26] know just like it was when I was in in
[1:43:28] Africa that you realize when a hippo is
[1:43:30] born I'm sorry when a rhinoceros is born
[1:43:33] you realize that a baby rhino has to be
[1:43:35] in constant contact with its mother a
[1:43:38] man that does Rehabilitation down the
[1:43:40] Mula hola Rehabilitation place down in
[1:43:42] South Africa they was taking these
[1:43:44] animals and they was actually trying to
[1:43:45] save them people would come in and shoot
[1:43:47] the rhinos and take their horns it's
[1:43:48] worth several million dollars in China
[1:43:50] they think there's some type of magical
[1:43:51] potion in so the posters come in and
[1:43:53] they shoot these rhinos to get their
[1:43:54] horn and that horn may be worth $2
[1:43:56] million and then there's a Babys side
[1:43:58] it's got a nub on its nose about that
[1:44:00] long they'll shoot it too because they
[1:44:02] realize the less there are the more
[1:44:03] value it
[1:44:04] is right so they was bringing these they
[1:44:07] was bringing these rhinos in whenever
[1:44:09] they find these babies and they they
[1:44:11] started to lose them at first until they
[1:44:12] found out it's got to be in constant
[1:44:14] contact with its mother so there's
[1:44:16] actually a student that goes there
[1:44:17] sleeps outside puts on this big outfit
[1:44:20] and is constant contact with that r that
[1:44:22] rhin and they raised that Rhino for its
[1:44:24] life I know I seen one they said there's
[1:44:27] a little baby about to come out there's
[1:44:28] a little baby and whatever you do don't
[1:44:30] stand in front of it so they opened up
[1:44:32] the gate and it was no little bitty you
[1:44:34] could feel the Earth moving on your feet
[1:44:36] as he ran out there and I thought Lord
[1:44:37] God have mercy I watched that Rhino come
[1:44:40] out went over to a gate took its horn
[1:44:42] opened it up and went outside I said
[1:44:44] what y'all doing she said I'm taking him
[1:44:45] for a walk W that's a big
[1:44:49] pet a baby eagle has to be in contact
[1:44:51] with its mother
[1:44:53] there's something that takes place in an
[1:44:56] eagle it's called the imparting or the
[1:44:58] imprinting on a baby eagle a newly
[1:45:01] hatched eagle has a lot to learn listen
[1:45:03] to this its most important figures in
[1:45:07] its life is its
[1:45:09] parents good very good and eaget must
[1:45:13] quickly be able to identify and bomb
[1:45:15] with them instead of another speci this
[1:45:18] parental recognition is known as filio
[1:45:19] imprinting Eagles pH filio imprinting
[1:45:22] often occur by learning to recognize the
[1:45:25] parents
[1:45:27] voice my sheep hear my amen so they
[1:45:31] identify who mama
[1:45:34] is by her voice no wonder Jesus says he
[1:45:38] that has an ear let him here birds can
[1:45:40] also imprint on their nesting sight
[1:45:42] which can help them listen to this
[1:45:44] Eagles imprint their nesting sight which
[1:45:46] can help them find their way back to the
[1:45:49] territory later on in life and it guides
[1:45:51] their choice of testing sites for their
[1:45:54] own young so whenever you receive an
[1:45:57] imprint from The Nest something has
[1:45:59] moved upon that eagle that it has the
[1:46:01] ability to find its way
[1:46:03] back and if you train up a child in the
[1:46:06] way that he should go come on somebody
[1:46:09] an eaglet grows another type of
[1:46:11] repenting occurs which they learn to
[1:46:12] identify with eagles as a species listen
[1:46:16] to this and the first thing they need to
[1:46:18] know is they're an eagle too
[1:46:21] amen it's hard to identify any other
[1:46:24] Eagle unless you know you're an eagle
[1:46:27] they call it the importance of the
[1:46:28] socialization of the eagle he needs to
[1:46:30] know what he is and the more he's around
[1:46:34] other Eagles come on somebody the more
[1:46:36] he's around other eagles he identifies
[1:46:39] with eagle weights he sees an eagle fly
[1:46:41] he knows he's supposed to fly he hears
[1:46:43] an eagle scream he knows he's supposed
[1:46:45] to Green Mama's got a beak and I got a
[1:46:47] beak Mama's got talons and I got talons
[1:46:50] Mama's got wings and I got Wings Mama
[1:46:52] scream an ice cream what is it doing
[1:46:54] it's recognizing this is what I am
[1:46:57] everything that she is that's what I am
[1:46:59] he's an eagle I'm an eagle whatever he
[1:47:01] is I'm identified with
[1:47:04] him
[1:47:05] Hallelujah there Comes A
[1:47:08] Time as I take this from
[1:47:12] Deuteronomy Moses said the eagle stirs
[1:47:14] The Nest up science today calls it
[1:47:17] fledging the mother Eagle knows it's a
[1:47:20] dangerous time if an Eagle St stays too
[1:47:23] long to the nest but it's also dangerous
[1:47:25] if it don't stays stay long enough so if
[1:47:28] it gets put if it's put out the nest too
[1:47:29] early it'll die if it stays there too
[1:47:33] long premature fledging
[1:47:37] occurs an eagle will leave the nest too
[1:47:41] early if it's in contact by human
[1:47:45] activity so if humans ever get their
[1:47:47] hands on
[1:47:49] it it causes
[1:47:51] death pleas premature fledging takes
[1:47:54] place when it's influenced by outside
[1:47:57] human activity I thought that's so
[1:47:58] powerful yes sir so there's a season
[1:48:01] that the eagle needs to leave the nest
[1:48:04] and God knows exactly when that needs to
[1:48:05] be at and for everybody it's different
[1:48:08] everybody matures at a different way a
[1:48:10] different rate everybody grows at a
[1:48:11] different rate ain't not a there's not
[1:48:13] one Christian the same everybody's born
[1:48:15] different at a different time a
[1:48:17] different season learn quicker than the
[1:48:18] others everybody is different but there
[1:48:21] comes a time that Mama knows she's got
[1:48:23] to stir up that Nest think about what
[1:48:26] she does so the place that was a
[1:48:28] blessing for so long think about it it
[1:48:31] can become a place of too much security
[1:48:34] and think about it so what she does is
[1:48:37] to get them ready to leave she takes the
[1:48:39] fur out of the nest so the fur which
[1:48:42] protected the eaglets from the Thorns is
[1:48:45] now not protecting them they're actually
[1:48:46] protruding through and it pokes a little
[1:48:48] Eagle Ben Zachary was watching some
[1:48:51] Eagles earlier this year they was born
[1:48:52] last December and we watched them all up
[1:48:54] into the summer I was watching as the
[1:48:56] mother had taken all the stuff in the
[1:48:58] bottom of the nest and I tell you it was
[1:48:59] incredible I was it was like a boneyard
[1:49:01] in there where she brought all kinds of
[1:49:02] fish and she took everything out of the
[1:49:04] nest and I was watching there was one of
[1:49:07] them there was one of those little
[1:49:08] Eagles oh it loved to lay in the bottom
[1:49:11] of the nest every time you turn it on my
[1:49:14] she would be right there laying on the
[1:49:15] bottom of the nest until finally I
[1:49:17] watched her go over to the corner and
[1:49:19] she was getting ready to for go bed down
[1:49:21] and when she bed it down she must have
[1:49:23] bted down right on a thorn CA she jumped
[1:49:26] up
[1:49:27] amen and God knows if he allows us to
[1:49:31] stay the way we are we'll never learn
[1:49:33] how to walk the way we need to walk or
[1:49:36] fly the way we need to fly so what does
[1:49:39] she do stirs up the nest and when the
[1:49:42] eagle comes into the nest you always
[1:49:44] know when she's coming because the
[1:49:46] little eaglet starts standing up you
[1:49:48] know why before she ever gets to the
[1:49:49] nest she always announces her approach
[1:49:53] before she ever gets there and when she
[1:49:56] comes to the nest she takes her big
[1:49:57] wings and goes up flopping and all the
[1:49:59] little feathers and stuff just leaves
[1:50:00] the nest and the babies are there I
[1:50:02] watched them I watched them I thought
[1:50:04] how's she going to get them out of this
[1:50:05] Nest so what Mama did is that she quit
[1:50:09] flying into the middle of the nest and
[1:50:11] taking the the the trout and then stuff
[1:50:13] and ripping it up and feeding it to them
[1:50:14] cuz she'd done that for months but I
[1:50:17] watched her one day she flew down she
[1:50:19] didn't land in the nest she landed on
[1:50:21] the limb so if the eaglets want to
[1:50:26] eat you got to go where the food is you
[1:50:30] should have seen them the first time
[1:50:31] they come out a little bit Topsy Turvy
[1:50:33] they had their wings open most of the
[1:50:35] time you could tell they was a little
[1:50:36] bit scared yeah but the longer they sit
[1:50:38] on the limb the more comfortable they
[1:50:40] got are you hearing me can you imagine
[1:50:43] days of the nest was coming to the end
[1:50:45] because now they're sitting like every
[1:50:47] other Eagle on the limb until finally it
[1:50:51] comes time to learn Le how to
[1:50:53] fly amen what's Mama do I love the way
[1:50:58] the prophet says it the prophet tells us
[1:51:01] that Mama Eagle will take those little
[1:51:03] eaglets and put them on her wings and
[1:51:06] she'll go way up into the heavens and
[1:51:09] she'll turn just a little bit and the
[1:51:11] eaglet fall off and he said they start
[1:51:14] turning over and over and over one time
[1:51:18] they're on their back the other time
[1:51:19] they're upright other time they're on
[1:51:20] the head other time they're upside down
[1:51:22] they're falling and that's all they are
[1:51:23] they fallen and Mama at any minute can
[1:51:25] swoop down underneath them now I'm not
[1:51:27] talking about little B chicks like that
[1:51:28] I'm talking about these are pretty good
[1:51:29] size Eagles by this time but what are
[1:51:32] they doing they're learning how to
[1:51:34] fly and I thought oh my what would keep
[1:51:37] that eagle what would keep it from
[1:51:40] thinking what happens if Mama forgets
[1:51:42] about me and she drops me off and and
[1:51:45] I'm falling and I I hit the ground well
[1:51:47] see you got to understand this that a
[1:51:50] eagle can fly about 40 miles an hour
[1:51:53] straight but when an eagle puts its
[1:51:55] wings back and it's going to a nose dive
[1:51:58] it can fly of speeds of 90 to 100 miles
[1:52:00] an hour which tells the little eaglet
[1:52:03] this she's been watching Mama her whole
[1:52:05] life that was somewhere I would fall and
[1:52:07] I would Start Tumbling that Mama has the
[1:52:10] ability to fly faster than I can fall
[1:52:14] let's stand our feet tonight I said mama
[1:52:17] has the ability to fly faster than what
[1:52:20] you can fall that's the kind of God that
[1:52:23] we serve tonight don't you realize God
[1:52:26] allows things come into our life to stir
[1:52:28] the nest up Thorns thistles troubles
[1:52:30] trials tests discomforts all of those
[1:52:32] things what's God doing it stirring up
[1:52:34] the nest so that he'll finally get us to
[1:52:36] the place where we'll learn how to fly
[1:52:40] oh my Eagles are so
[1:52:43] incredible as an eagle starts learning
[1:52:45] how to
[1:52:46] fly this oil starts building up on him
[1:52:50] because Eagles goes through Seasons to
[1:52:52] where the oil gets on their wings and
[1:52:54] their wings starts actually taking on
[1:52:56] debris and all types of fil upon their
[1:52:59] wings and what happens is is that eagle
[1:53:01] goes through a stage called the molting
[1:53:03] stage and during the molting stage
[1:53:05] whenever the Eagle's Wings starts
[1:53:08] getting Fray what happens is is that oil
[1:53:10] causes its feathers to fray so the eagle
[1:53:13] knows it's got to go down so what it
[1:53:15] does is it goes down into the valley and
[1:53:17] when it gets in the valley he starts
[1:53:19] pulling The Frayed feathers he starts
[1:53:21] pulling them out out because an eagle
[1:53:24] can still fly with 75% of its feathers
[1:53:27] pulled out it still has the ability to
[1:53:30] fly that means it can go through some
[1:53:33] stuff but there's sometimes he gets down
[1:53:36] the ground and he's got too many
[1:53:38] feathers that's frayed he can look up
[1:53:41] into the heavens and calcium deposits
[1:53:44] begins to build up on his face until it
[1:53:47] gets over the top of his beak and he has
[1:53:49] to go over to a rock and they start
[1:53:51] pecking on the Rock to break it off and
[1:53:54] if an eagle is in a valley like it was
[1:53:57] there in North Carolina a few years ago
[1:53:59] when the man went up there to the Eagle
[1:54:01] Rock and was looking down and they seen
[1:54:03] these eagles flying in the heavens and
[1:54:06] he got over there and he said look how
[1:54:08] beautiful these Eagles are he said
[1:54:09] they're beautiful he said but let me
[1:54:11] show you something else and he took him
[1:54:13] to the other side where there's a great
[1:54:14] valley at and there was three or four
[1:54:16] Eagles down there that was in the molten
[1:54:18] stage down in the valley and he said
[1:54:20] what's wrong with them Eagles he said
[1:54:22] the in the molten
[1:54:24] stage and while they're in the molten
[1:54:26] stage their feet swell up and they can't
[1:54:29] walk the way they need to walk and their
[1:54:31] feathers become frayed and they can't
[1:54:33] fly the way they need to fly so he goes
[1:54:36] against The Rock and he pecks on that
[1:54:38] rock to break the calcium off
[1:54:41] Hallelujah he said well if he can't fly
[1:54:44] he can't catch his own food how in the
[1:54:47] world is the eagle going to live he said
[1:54:49] that's the beautiful thing about it
[1:54:52] and while he's standing there watching
[1:54:54] these Eagles in the valley here comes
[1:54:56] some other eagles over the top of the
[1:54:58] Eagles in the valley he said what is
[1:55:00] that he's said let me tell you what's
[1:55:01] going on you see them Eagles right there
[1:55:04] every one of them Eagles at one time in
[1:55:06] their life has been down in that Valley
[1:55:09] they've been right there where the rest
[1:55:10] of them Eagles are and they know why
[1:55:12] they're in that Valley that they can't
[1:55:14] eat the way they need to eat so what
[1:55:15] they do is they go kill the Eagles
[1:55:17] that's in the valley they go kill them a
[1:55:19] rabbit and they take that meat over the
[1:55:21] top of those Eagles they can't move and
[1:55:23] they drop the meat down where they're at
[1:55:25] so that the others Eagles can get
[1:55:27] strength because they know if they don't
[1:55:29] eat the way they need to eat they won't
[1:55:31] have strength to fight for their own
[1:55:32] lives aren't you glad God sends people
[1:55:35] by your way aren't you glad God sends
[1:55:37] Preachers by your way sermons byy your
[1:55:39] way somebody text you call you email you
[1:55:42] whatever it is what are they doing
[1:55:43] they're dropping a little bit of meat
[1:55:44] down there for you you may have been a
[1:55:45] little bit disturbed a little bit down a
[1:55:47] little bit desponded and about that time
[1:55:49] an eagle comes by where you're at why is
[1:55:51] it they been where you
[1:55:53] they know what it is to go through it
[1:55:55] let's buy our hearts tonight blessed be
[1:55:58] the name of the Lord praise be to
[1:56:01] God
[1:56:03] hallelujah I don't even know who needed
[1:56:05] to hear this tonight and I don't you
[1:56:07] don't even have to tell me but I want to
[1:56:10] remind you
[1:56:11] tonight that Mom egole can fly faster
[1:56:15] than what you can fall you may be down
[1:56:18] and discouraged tonight you may look at
[1:56:21] your life and you may see all types of
[1:56:23] calcium around your beak you may see
[1:56:24] your feet swelled up and busted open you
[1:56:27] may see your feathers frayed but I want
[1:56:29] to tell you you serve a God that God's
[1:56:32] in
[1:56:33] control does not the eagle Mount up at
[1:56:35] his
[1:56:36] command does not God command other
[1:56:39] eagles to help other eagles does not the
[1:56:41] Bible say sons of God are led by the
[1:56:44] spirit of God
[1:56:47] hallelujah heavenly
[1:56:50] father I pray that you'd search every
[1:56:52] every one of us tonight Lord from the
[1:56:53] front to the
[1:56:55] back lord I preach this tonight because
[1:56:57] you put this on my heart I've held this
[1:57:00] in my bosom now Lord and I've done my
[1:57:02] best to be able to give it to the church
[1:57:05] I pray tonight Lord that these words
[1:57:07] would Pierce every heart may they pierce
[1:57:10] every mind Lord I know what it's like
[1:57:13] Lord I was there it wasn't too long ago
[1:57:17] Lord I'd been through so many things and
[1:57:19] the church had been through so many
[1:57:20] things and I'd buried five six people
[1:57:22] and just in a couple of months and I
[1:57:25] started losing my strength and I started
[1:57:26] getting a little bit down I started
[1:57:29] getting weary I had some situations come
[1:57:32] up and my body was taxed and my mind was
[1:57:35] taxed until I told my wife I can't talk
[1:57:37] one more I don't need one more phone
[1:57:39] call I can't take no
[1:57:42] more what happened is Lord my feathers
[1:57:45] was a little bit
[1:57:47] afid Lord I found there was some
[1:57:50] buildup Lord and I realized
[1:57:52] no matter whether we're preachers leoty
[1:57:55] no matter who we are we all must take in
[1:58:00] if we constantly give out if I
[1:58:03] constantly give and I preach and I pray
[1:58:05] and I give and I run and I preach and I
[1:58:08] give out there's got to be a time if I
[1:58:10] constantly give I got to be able to take
[1:58:13] in Lord and you allowed me to do that

[2:06:01] what it was it was mama Eagle dropping
[2:06:03] some food now wasn't that
[2:06:06] powerful y to I don't want to repr
[2:06:09] preach somebody's message but I I I love
[2:06:11] how Brother David brought that out that
[2:06:12] an eagle had to identify with other
[2:06:15] eagles you know brother brand preached
[2:06:16] the whole message on
[2:06:18] identification and he talked about how
[2:06:20] that we have so many things on our mind
[2:06:23] where you think that you can't overcome
[2:06:24] and you think that you're not good
[2:06:26] enough and you think that and you think
[2:06:28] you'll never make it and all the things
[2:06:29] that come into our natural mind he said
[2:06:31] but let this mind be in you that was in
[2:06:34] Christ Jesus took that scripture out of
[2:06:36] Philippians and preached the whole
[2:06:38] message on it to be identified with
[2:06:40] Jesus Christ so it ain't the way we feel
[2:06:42] or the way we think or the way we see
[2:06:44] things but have the mind of Christ and
[2:06:46] the mind of Christ identifies you with
[2:06:48] who you really are I think that's
[2:06:50] powerful the T that God would come and
[2:06:53] and remind the Church of who you are and
[2:06:56] some we need I need it I need to hear
[2:06:58] that tonight how many can lift your hand
