morning there's no God like Jehovah and he's a savior he's a Healer he's a deliverer amen everything that his word said he would be he is this morning and amen the beautiful thing about it is he's personally been revealed to us anden we can testify this morning of his goodness and his grace and his mercy upon our lives and amen isin't it just an honor to serve the Lord today Amen to be gathered in the house of God with God's people and amen we lived another week in Satan's Eden and we still have a desire to serve the Lord amen lot of people looking for miracles and looking over Miracles amen you are a miracle this morning and we do want to say God bless you all today and wasn't that a wonderful song service this morning and then just feeling the presence of God coming through the building and we want to look in the word today as we invite you in the scripture to the book of St John the 18th chapter we're going to read there again in St John 18 verse number 37 then we're going to look in the Book of Psalms in the 16th chapter this morning we do want to greet you all in the name of the Lord and we counted an honor and privilege to be here once again with you all and and appreciate brother Matt for the invitation the opport opportunity the confidence to stand here while he's away and minister to you we just pray the Lord would bless them and amen how many has come to have church today amen amen here in the book of St John the 18th chapter and in the 37th verse we read this last time we spoke to but I want to pick up a few things again here out of St John 18 and verse 37 the Bible says pilate therefore said unto him art thou a king then Jesus answered and thou and thou sayest that I am a king and to this end was I born and for this cause came I into the world now that I should bear witness unto the truth for everyone that is of the truth heareth my voice how many here this morning can say you're of the truth amen and pilate saith unto him what is truth think of that he's looking at truth and asking what is truth and when he had said this he went out again into to the Jews and sath unto them I find in him no fault at all but ye have a custom that I should release unto you one at the Passover now will you therefore that I release unto you the king of the Jews then cried they all again saying not this man but barabus now barabus was a robber now I find it very interesting that they turned down the anointed word and accepted a robber in the place of the anointed word now there they were in the presence of the anointed word if we can look in Psalms chapter 16 Psalms chapter 16 with that in mind standing in the presence of the anointed word in Psalms chapter 16 and verse 11 I know this is a very very familiar reading uh to you this morning we could probably quote it by heart in psalm 16 and verse 11 David says this he says Thou will show me the path of life for in thy presence is the fullness of joy in thy presence is the fullness of joy and at thy right hand there are Pleasures forever more amen let's just bow our hearts together today Heavenly Father Lord what an honor it is to be your children here today Father to be gathered together Lord not just in a church service Lord fulfilling religious duty but Lord we're here because there is is a deep calling to the deep and Lord there's a group of people standing before me today Lord that are Desiring to serve you to follow you and Lord as we come here this morning we come for one motive and one objective and that is to lift up the name that is above every name Lord that at the name of Jesus every knee would bow every tongue would confess Lord at your name situations can change at Your Name Lord Believers can take another step in your grace and I'm praying this morning that you would send the spirit wisdom and Revelation into this meeting oh God may you drive out every Spirit that's unlike the Holy Spirit oh God lord I pray for those that may be sick in their body today I'm asking Lord that you would send Deliverance in that body for those that may be Lord at home unable to be here will listen Lord to the internet or or by the way of the archive I pray Lord that this word would strengthen their lives and Lord I pray you forgive us of our failures you forgive us of our shortcomings or we don't want to leave here like we came so father we're asking you you're yielding to your word changes this morning and we'll be sure to give thee all the praise all the honor and all the glory in the wonderful name of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ we pray and all the Believers says amen and amen God bless you this morning as you can have your seats I want to this morning by the help of the Lord amen maybe just to speak to you here today if I title this today I want to speak to you on yielded To Us by the message of the hour and we established I believe a Vindicated answer uh to the question of what is truth you know we look and we found that the message of the hour brother BR says it is Christ it's not a religion it's not a tradition it's Christ so then we find amen that the message of the hour is simply a amen God's promise for the present hour amen according to the scripture so we're not here this morning doing things apart from scripture we are doing things according to scripture now in Revelation 10 we looked there last time and we found that there was a cloud that appeared out there in Sunset mountain and we identified amen that that was Christ and out of that cloud he descended with an open book right amen and that was where our rapturing faith has come from and maybe this morning just to lay a foundation refresh your men uh your me by reading this quote power of transformation 65 he says we are now ready for a battle how many's ready for a battle amen the trumpet is to sound the hymns have been sang he said and now comes the word but to hear these comments of these young soldiers here myself getting old and listen around but your faith and confidence and what you have placed in to believe the message that I have been given of God he said now if it wasn't for you all the message would do no good amen I don't know maybe how you're feeling this morning but if if you're feeling a little bit low that ought to put you on the highs of highs amen that if it wasn't for you all the message would do no good see it's got to be somebody to believe it and as long as it's coming from God then there's going to be somebody believe it you see because God has made a way amen I believe we can all testify this morning that God has made a way where there was no way amen he was the way see God has made a way he said he has affixed his great economy amen like that that when he sends for something amen there is something there to meet that something the Deep responds to the call of the deep amen see it's got to be that way now amen we're speaking this morning on yielding to Opportunities now the definition there of opportunity it is a set of circumstances amen that makes it possible to do something it is a chance for success or advancement occurs so amen amen an opportunity amen is when something is set up or something is fixed or something is arranged Amen in a way that you actually accept that and when you accept that you advance by what you are accepting I want to say this morning I do not believe that we are going backwards I do not believe that we are retreating I do not believe we're turning to the left or turning to the right amen but I believe as the Church of the Living God Amen we are advancing in the promises we are advancing in The Inheritance we are advancing amen everything that God said we could move move into amen I believe this is the generation that we're moving into it I love how the prophet of God says this in spite of dungeons or swords or storms amen God's Church marches onward amen I think that's a preaching point in spite of storms in spite of dungeons in spite of trials in spite of anything amen God's church is moving onward amen we're so happy to be a part amen of that blessed body looking shortly for the coming of our blessed Lord amen who will receive us up into his kingdom amen into his presence there will be with him forever oh the Glorious thoughts amen and the joy that sweeps through our souls amen when we look upon these promises amen think about that there is a joy amen that sweeps through our souls amen when we're looking upon these promises and the holy spirit amen is bearing record unto us that they are the truth amen you all know that when you start sweeping something the reason you sweep it amen is you're getting rid of something amen so something else can move there when you sweep something whatever is laying there does not belong there amen so by sweeping you are removing it and I want to say this morning if depression is laying in your heart amen it does not belong there amen amen if negativity or sickness is laying in your heart it does not belong there amen but God who is rich in Mercy amen has sent a message that is a message of Promise amen and as those promises begin to sweep through the soul of a Believer amen the promises will sweep out sickness amen the promises will sweep out discouragement I say oh God this morning amen release the joy of your presence in the heart of every believer and let it sweep out depression let it sweep out condemnation let it sweep out negativity and let the joy of the Lord amen become the strength of the church I do not believe we're going backwards I do not believe we're retreating amen I believe we're moving onward and upward Amen Brother Don we got one goal and that's rapture we got one place to be and that's the future home amen and no matter what the devil froze at us we have been anointed by the message of the hour Amen to overcome every devil to overcome every situation we are living in the hour of the advancement of the Gospel of Jesus Christ amen can you say with me we're not going backwards we're going forward I don't feel like it we're going forward I don't know how we're going to make it we're going forward I don't know what tomorrow holds we're going forward well I'm sick in my body we're going forward well I failed God yesterday we're going forward church we have not been anointed to come this far and lay down and quit there is an anointing Upon Our Lives Amen to tear down every devil destroy every Spirit walk on every Power come on church I think it's time Amen to rise up and let the joy of the Holy Ghost sweep in the church again until we can catch a vision of the future future amen by the message of the hour but said the thing today is amen the church grain don't want to mature it wants to stay like it was back in Moody's time or s or fine or noox or Calvin he said they were all right amen they were the light of their hour now when you mention names like Moody sanki finny Knox Calvin what we're referring to is reformers amen who were operating in the age of reformation but what they were bringing was not enough to bring a people unto perfection so in order to bring the church to Perfection amen God had to fulfill his word amen by sending us a prophet he said see this is another hour this is another day amen this is the advancement of the Gospel it's coming to its maturity amen I want to prophesy Over You by the word this morning amen you're not going to remain an infancy amen according to a prophet amen you're moving into maturity amen I don't care how long you've been in church I don't care the past I don't care the background amen I have heard a Vindicated prophet and he has said you are coming to maturity and there ain't enough Devils to stop it we're in the fat days to defeat it amen what God has purposed in his heart will be manifested in his church and the devil won't stop it and bad days won't stop it because we have been given an anointing by the word of God in the age we're living in it's coming to its maturity amen I want to tell that devil amen he might have run us around in our infancy amen but we're coming to maturity are you hearing me amen do you know what's changing the type of services you're having amen it's not because of who's preaching it's not because of who's coming or who's going it's because you and your Christian walk are moving into a place of maturity where the devil don't know what to do with you come on church amen y'all remember what it was like in your infancy amen if something was a little wrong before church amen you come in and you couldn't get past it and you couldn't raise feel like preaching and you couldn't shout and you couldn't enjoy the anointing amen but now you moved from infancy into maturity and when something bad happens before church or somebody says something to you negative amen that don't kill your service amen you are a mature Christan and you have a revelation in your soul and everything is going to be okay I don't care who said what I don't care who looked at me wrong I have received a vision Amen in the presence of God yes sir L we're coming to maturity it's coming see we can't live in what Luther said or what Wesley said or some of the rest of them we're living in the light amen that's predicted for this day we are living in the light amen that is predicted for this day we're in the seventh Church age he said not the third or the fourth Church age amen the grain should be able to receive it amen you are that grain seed bride then you should be able to receive amen the word that is coming in the hour you're living in he said if it doesn't receive it amen then it falls off and it means nothing to it he said but the grain is matured with the light amen the grain is matured with the light amen if it goes ahead with the light so the only way the grain matures amen is if it advances with the light amen as the light advances you know what John said he said in 1 John 1:7 amen if we walk in the light amen I love that if we walk in the light amen as he is in the light then we have Fellowship one with another amen and the blood of Jesus Christ his son amen cleanseth us from all sin 1 John 1:7 amen if we walk in the light amen as he is in the light then we have Fellowship one with another amen I love the definition of this word walk it means to make one's way it means to progress in other words if you're walking amen you're not staying where you were and you're not going back to where you come from amen but you're walking and you are progressing Amen to walk in the light it means to make due use of opportunities amen oh that makes me want to shout hallelujah amen the word walk means in the Greek it means to make use of due opportunities in Romans 13:11 Paul said knowing the time that now is High Time Amen to wake out of sleep amen for now is our Salvation nearer amen than when we believed the night is far spent amen the day is at hand so let us therefore cast off the works of darkness and let us put on Amen the armor of light amen if you're going to walk in the light you're going to have to have the armor of the light amen that's the only thing that will defeat the darkness come on church amen you can't wear Luther's message and defeat the darkness of Leota you can't wear a reformer message and defeat the darkness of ecclesiastical Devils but there is a light that has been provided by the message of the hour and if you can cast off the works of darkness and put on the armor of light you can walk as a son of light you can sing well I might as well just preacher for a second amen we are not in darkness we are not hopeless helplessly confused aimlessly wandering through Darkness but we have received a message and it's a message of light and we are the Grain and we're walking with the light and as we're walking with the lot amen our worship is maturing Our Praise Is maturing our character is matur yes sir come on we might as well preach a amen a 5-year-old acts like a 5-year-old because they're 5 years old a 10-year-old acts like a 10 year old because they're 10 years old amen a 50y old shouldn't be acting like a 5-year old and a oh come on are you hearing me there's got to come a time amen that you move to maturity amen and the only way you can mature as the light matures and you walk with that light Paul says in Ephesians 5:116 he says Redeeming the time because the days are evil now I want to break this down Redeeming the time that actually means to buy up every and each opportunity it means to buy up every and each opportunity look at this word time it is the Supreme moment can you can can you take that in your heart it is the Supreme moment it is the golden opportunity Paul is saying amen buy up amen every and each opportunity amen use every Supreme moment use every golden opportunity in other words Paul is saying amen redeem our golden opportunity in the presence of God himself now I love what the prophet of God said he said don't never fail your opportunity see Satan is always trying Amen to cause us to miss our spiritual opportunity ities by using natural things remember said oh we have to polish the car we can't go to church on Sunday no I know Jesus comes to the church but my I ain't got time to go over there if I fail to get my oil change today it may burn my bearings out tomorrow he said burn them out that's right he said burn them out he said I'd rather my Barons be burned out amen than my soul to torment in Hell through all eternity don't you miss your opportunity it's presented to every man and woman in this world daily like that amen but they fail to get to see their opportunity can I say this to you your opportunity in his presence is not a possibility amen it is a appointment amen it is an assurity listen you're not coming in his presence amen hoping you will find Joy hoping you will find Deliverance hoping you will find Victory amen all those things are in his presence and the light is the presence of God if we can step out of confusion if we can step out of the darkness and we can step over into the light of his presence then every desire of the heart will be made manifest I love the problem of God's words he said every sinner that's in here he said perhaps there would be one you've been saved amen since Jesus died well that's a long time ago brother Travis but a prophet said amen you were saved when Jesus died but you don't never die here he said but don't you never die here where you're opportunity was placed before you so your opportunity to accept oh God what Jesus done at Calvary was not on the literal day that he hung on Mount Calvary but in his mind amen he had a time where you would come into the presence of the finished work of what he did at Calvary and that would be your opportunity to accept what he did 2,000 years ago in other words brother Wes say Amen 2,000 years ago you were saved but the night you got saved was not the night you really got saved it was the night you accepted what he' done for you 2,000 years ago come on if you're sick in your body this morning amen he's not going to heal you today he healed you 2,000 years ago come on before the sickness there was the healing before the bondage there was the Deliverance so the only thing you're doing today amen is accepting what he done hallelujah now do you see why we had to have a prophet because denomination had killed the effect of his presence they put him in a Manger in in in Bethlehem they put him in a grave in Jerusalem amen but prophet of God stood on the platform and said I've come to tell you he's not dead he's the same yesterday today and forever and if I can just get you to see amen that he's here in the form of his word it's the form he promised to be here in then all things are finished all sins are forgiven all sicknesses are healed all devils are defeated I'm talking about somebody amen moving in the light of his presence and accepting the manifestation of what he done for you he's not saving you this morning he's already saved you some of y'all got babies you can't wait to see them get saved can I say this they're already saved they just don't know it well we might as well shout aloud on that one you got people you want to see healed amen and they're saying I can't get better amen I prophesy side by the word they're already healed come on church amen when your baby comes back to the house of God Amen he ain't coming to get saved he's coming to accept what's always been his well we might as well shout aloud amen when your brother or your sister comes back amen it ain't coming because they're trying to work something up amen they're coming to accept amen what God settled for them that day at Calvary see but don't you never die here where your opportunity was placed before you to go into his presence amen then to try to accept it now see his presence has been reveal amen if I if I can make sense of this amen go in me with your in your mind with me back to Calvary and see the Lord Jesus hanging there okay he hangs there brother Kobe and he says his words it is finished right amen now come 2,000 years into Grace Tabernacle and somebody needs something from the atonement can I say this I don't have to take you back physically to golgatha to get what you need but what was there has come into the church here the same presence that was there is here this morning so what I've got to get you to do is to accept that what he done there will be manifested here and then when you go there you're not going into his presence amen as a condemned person you're going into his presence as a redeemed person listen friends amen there's something about the presence of God it will condemn The Sinner but it will stimulate the believer it will condemn the unbeliever but it will revive amen the heart of a seat of God it's made for now see right now you must accept it if you go beyond the blood then you're already judged think about that if you go beyond the blood then you're already judged so right now amen there is a blood barrier right now there is an atonement between you and judgment and if you can accept it right now oh God Amen then you're already judged because you're judged by the way you treated the atonement of the Lord Jesus Christ see you judge yourself there oh Christian what an opportunity that we have we have opportunities Paul never dreamed of having have opportunities Enoch and Elijah and all have never had amen the opportunities we have now think about that church the opportunities that we have now in 2 Corinthians 6 ver1 Paul says amen that we then as workers together with him beseech you also that you receive not the grace of God in vain for he saith amen I have heard thee in a Time accepted and in the day of salvation have I secured thee behold now is the accepted time in other words Paul is saying amen salvation was settled that day at Calvary but now is the time Amen to accept amen the benefit of what Christ did that day it Calvary amen behold now is the day of salvation I say this with everything within me we ought to screaming from every pit we ought to back it from every Pew amen now is the day of salvation now is the time amen that men can get RS and homes can come back together listen I just feel like preaching this morning sister Cindy amen if Jesus Christ did it then he can do it again now if he save then he can save now if he healed then he can heal now listen you want to take this meting to the next level amen just start accepting what God did that day at Calvary and you will become a product of the finished work of the Salvation Grace of almighty God Amen brother Mark we ain't got to look back and say I wish I been there I wish I was there I wish I was there I can say what was there is here now is the day of salvation I love what the prophet of God said this is our visitation let's remember Christ he's the same yesterday today and forever Hebrews 13:8 don't wait till some region Yonder in the Damned in that Dimension where you cannot go in the presence of God see right now you have the opportunity to go in the presence of God the blood is making it available for you to go into his presence and your time is up on Earth in the nightmare of horror you'll remember you had your opportunity and turned it away let the young people take notice to this he said let all all take notice to it amen see in our scripture this morning the scene of our scripture we are reading about Jesus Christ amen who was fing a hang on that cross but he's in Pilot's Hall brother said see we stand now watch brother bam I love how he preaches things because he brings it from then to now and he says we're standing in a similar situation this morning the world over a trial see all denominations has turned down the word I know this sounds very harsh and I want the ministers who is listening here present those on tape also to try to understand this now that I try to make it plain but I'm holding my point or making my point here and saying that we are standing today in another Pilot's judgment hall now think about that a prophet of God said we're standing today in another Pilot's judgment Hall you say well if I had just stood there I would have spoke out for Jesus Christ well what are you doing about it now amen come on hindsight 2020 right you can sit here this morning and say if I would have been back there if I would have stood back there I would have done this and I would now don't get mad at me amen but some of you are saying that and you can't even say Amen here come on some of you saying oh if I'd have been back there brother Joe I would have stood for him amen but you're here now and can't stand for him you see what I'm saying amen it's the devil trying to rob you amen of using your opportunity in his presence Amen to advance from the condition you're in into the condition God desires to see you in according to his word I want to tell that devil Satan you ain't got enough you ain't got enough to stop us you ain't got enough to hold us amen there is a seed on the inside of our soul and the seed on side of our soul amen is stronger than the pressure against our flesh listen we're not here making a decision God made the decision for us we're just yielding to what he done for us that day at Calvary well what are you doing about it now he said that's the thing no matter how much the church had turned him down I would have stood by his side you've got the opportunity uhhuh see they turned him down can I say this pilot amen had his opportunity in the presence of the atonement now can I show you something brother said pilot his only opportunity he ever had and he asked him he said now let me see something done see let me see some sign said what pilot should have done was he should have repented listen Church he's in the presence of the forgiver he's in the presence of the atonement he's in the presence brother brother Tom of the one who can change his future listen Pilot's in a position right now but he's got an opportunity in the presence of Jesus Christ amen to advance amen from where he is into being a forgiven man are you he hear me the opportunity was presented and he said oh do me some Trick R said he had an opportunity but when he had his opportunity to accepted wanted some kind of a clown or some kind of a trick or some kind of a magic rabbit to bring out of a hat you know or something he said oh I would see you do some trick you know or something like that he said pilot was a nut he had a chance to receive it but he didn't come on church he had a chance to receive it amen but he didn't so you know what he did he stayed in the same condition and he died an insane man with the blood of Jesus Christ on his hands come on church and the prophet of God said his blood will either be on your hands or sister Judy it'll be in our hearts and I want to say this morning I may be in another pilot Hall but the blood of my Lord is not on my hands it's going to move into my heart and by that blood I'm going to advance to Victory and by that blood I'm going to advance to the Future Hope and by that blood I'm going to take a Rapture and by that blood my family is going to be saved and by that blood my body's going to be healed and by that blood my future is going to be clear you're in the presence of the atonement and there's a bleeding bloody word now you said brother why are you so heavy on a prophet because the Prophet come into pilot Hall and saved us from Pilot Hall he said denomination is turn turn this word down listen they've taken one book and made a thousand translations of it come on now we've even moved from the King James to the Queen James maybe you didn't know that it's Sodom and Gomorrah again we don't have a King James they got a transgender Bible I might as well preach I'm here do you see what theyve done they've turned down the word now you you'd be crazy to say that denominations is better today than they were 50 years ago when they turned down this word brother they did not Advance they regressed they went backwards come on now because you cannot stand in the presence of an atonement and your attitude remain as it's just another message or another church service and leave a better person come on I might as well bring it on down to you amen can I get it through your head Grace Tabernacle these are not just Services these are not just Wednesday nights and Sunday mornings and if meetings here and again listen these are [Applause] opportunities come on somebody asked me one time ler why do you go to a pull pit on Wednesday night and preach your heart out like it's a convention I said because to me it is a convention I don't care if there's five or 500 or three it's an opportunity to stand in the middle of pilot Hall in a world of determination to destroy this word and throw a Lifeline out to somebody and say there's a God and he's a a mighty God he's a miracle working God he's a way making God he's a saving God come on Grace Tabernacle I pray to God we never get to the place where we just let the services become just common and we see who sing well I might as well preach I miss close to it amen you know what you can I preach Mark amen I say God forbid we ever get in the condition we sit around and compare preachers and compare singers well they sung better and that's funny and make a joke out of everything in the house of God I say God forbid the day that the house of God ever becomes a House of Comedy it's a house of correction it's a house of change it's a House of Authority it's a place where God can come on the scene and rescue our babies and save homes and save lives from the destruction of the [Music] enemy it's opportunities it's opportunities come on Church Isaiah 28 said all the tables are full of vomit right go read your Bible all the tables are full of vomit remember said those tables are denominations he said they're everyone full of vomit he said there's Baptist vomit that don't get mad at me there's Pentecostal vomit come on Church you know what vomit comes from it comes from something that made you sick come on and what they laid on the altar literally made God sick to his stomach and he said it's vomit come on you you want me prove it to you amen amen just put your name on the card and you're saved could you imagine sister Chloe being the Lord Jesus that hung on Calvary shed his blood went through all that and then stand and see somebody say now if you want to be saved here's all you got to do just put your name on a card and shake a preacher's hand come on Sir y'all know what I'm talking about they been work hard on something and then watch something happen to it and what do you say that makes me about Plum sick you know why because you put your all into it and somewhere somebody amen determined what you done wasn't enough so they got to add to it or take away from it and I want to say this as plain as I know how denominations has added to this word and they've taken away from this word until it's another book on another shelf but I say thank God in the last days he would send a prophet into this generation who would stand on the platform and say all the tables are full of vomit but there's an elaser call there's a Malachi for call there's a return to the word call coming in the church to lead us back to the paths of Holiness yes sir somebody Shout with me God sent a prophet somebody shouted with me God sent a prophet thank God for the reformers but thank God David Paul he sent a prophet thank God for the sankes and the finnies and the knocks and the Calvin but thank God for [Applause] Elijah who can say now you're dying where you're at that you got to move with light now you know this in Amos 3:7 the Bible says surely the Lord God will do nothing but he revealeth his Secrets unto his servants the prophets in Malachi 4:5 behold I will send you Elijah the prophet can I just stop and say something to you A lot of people only see brother random and Malachi four all they see is Elijah the prophet but can I say there's actually three people in Malachi 4:5 behold I which is God the Lord Jesus Christ the Father of Lights behold I will send you come on now put your name there behold I will send Andrew Glover behold I will send Don Reynolds behold I will send Morgan moris Elijah let's put a name there William Mary and brandham the Prophet come on it ain't all about a man it ain't all about a prophet it's about the work of restoration being done in the church to return the heart of the children amen back to the faith of God to believe that what he done he still does come on Ecclesiastes tree amen he is the god that never changes he is the Ever Changing amen rather unchanging God and he's the same yesterday today and forever said it'll take a prophet to get the Revelation because God has no other other way of bringing out his scriptural Revelations except by a prophet God has no other way of declaring to you that this is your opportunity except by prophit watch what he says amen now watch amen and he says the word always comes by a prophet and always will this is the law of God is evident even by casual search of scripture so you don't have to have a degree to believe it but we ought to all shout hallelujah you ain't got to be born in the right family to believe that God still uses Prophet you ain't got to come out of Bob Jones University or graduate from Harvard to believe that God still uses prophets but God by a casual search of his scripture can see that he does he said what is it it's the unchanging God with unchanging ways invariably sent his prophet in every age where the people had stray amen from divine order so what is this message it is the restoring of divine order all the tables are full of vomit because somewhere they got out of order oh come on church and how can we get back in order unless God send somebody that knows the order sir y'all remember the prodag god that they're out there working on the car remember that he said the mechanic was out there and brother Mark he was all greasy I bet youd like for him to walk by yesterday Joe amen the mechanics out there and he's been over and he's working and he's tying this and tying that and tying this and tying that and he said all of a sudden he couldn't get the thing to run and he said all of a sudden the guy walked by Amen in a suit and he looked over at him and he said now sir amen if you'll tie that to that the car will run remember that amen I found a beautiful picture in there amen don't get mad at me okay but you got a Pentecostal been over and he's working and working and working and working how are we going to get this thing to run how we going to get this thing to move and then all of a sudden Elijah comes walking by P pit come on church amen he didn't look like him he didn't talk like him but he had the answer to make the car run and I love how the prophet of God said it brother Wesley he said that mechanic looked back at him and he said he had enough sense to listen to him he said if I'll do that will it run he said do it he said he done what he said in the car run he said now here he was the chief designer had now come on the scene come on church amen he had an opportunity oh god with the one who with the the one who designed the car with the one who built the car with the one who made the car was now standing in his presence with the answer on how to get the car to run and instead of trying to work it up and try to fire it up amen he just yielded to the voice and said if you said that's the way it does that's what we're going to do I'm on Grace Tabernacle you want to break out in Revival that the cold days won't shut up you want to break out in Revival amen that ill feelings and bad attitudes will never squash amen may hear the voice of the seventh angel restore the order to the church yes sir come on you'll be able to shout if they don't sing your favorite song you'll be able to dance if they don't have a hot guitar you'll be able to shout if the pastor is out of town you'll be able to pull if you are sick come on church I'm talking about somebody who has returned to the divine order of the word of God that's why the devil hates us we didn't walk away from light brother Travis we stepped in the light and we're walking with the light we're progressing with a lot we now know how to baptize we know oh God we now know how to have communion we now know how to preach we know now how to sing why because we made due use of the opportunity now he said when theologians and people have departed from the word God always sent his servant to these people people but apart from the theologians now what's he going to do he's going to correct the false teaching and lead the people back to God I remember one time brother Mark I got in a confr not confrontation but we'll just say heated Fellowship Pentecostal preacher one time and he told me he said y'all just follow a man see you got to have a man to do everything you say do I said really' he said yeah he said' that's why you got all them books and tapes is because you rely on a man more than you do god' I said oh really I said how do you baptize he said acts 238 he said how do you baptize I said acts 238 he said well that's Bible I said exactly I said how do you believe somebody gets the Holy Ghost he said speak in tongues I said how do you prove that he said well Bishop so and so in the 50s in the Pentecostal Council I said hi I got you he said how do you believe the Holy Ghost I said John 17 and John 14 and John 16 and John 15 when he the spirit of Truth has come he will receive the truth and how can the Holy Ghost come to confirm the truth and then you deny what the Holy Ghost has come to confirm he said so you mean speaking in tongues is not the evidence of Holy Ghost I said it is if you put a man over the interpretation of it but if you put God through a word born Prophet over it you'll come back to John 14 you'll come back to John 15 you'll come back to John 16 and say he is the spirit of Truth he is the god and he is the comforter and he is the headship of my life see remember Ezekiel y'all remember Ezekiel in the valley of dry bones can you give me exod or Ezekiel 3711 sorry I love this Ezekiel 3711 he said then he said unto me amen son of man amen these bones are the whole house of Israel he looks at the bones and he says see they're the whole house of Israel right now watch what he says behold they say our behold they say our bones amen are dried up and our hope is lost we are cut off amen for our parts listen they're in a Ezekiel is seeing a vision over this valley of dry bones and Salem he looks at this Valley and these B bones speak back and they say these words they say our hope is gone our our members were cut off from them amen our bones are dry up I want you to see this word hope it is a cord it is an expectation it is the ground of hope it is things hoped for amen it is the outcome in other words Amen brother Joe they're laying in the valley of dry bones and the bones are now saying there's no way we're coming out of this that's right I'm not very smart okay I'm just a country boy from the hills of East Tennessee and I think if you turn the word out come around it says come out out come turn it around and it says come out so in other words they said there's no outcome or in hillbilly country terms amen there's no way to come out of this oh God I'm preaching to you there's no way we can come out of this condition there's no way we can come out of this situation amen that was the devil's gospel that he had preach to them in that condition but when oh God when Ezekiel stepped on the scene as a Prophet come on church when he stepped on the scene as a prophet Len what the part of God said he said God help us American people to when we can get back to God again he said and God was able to help amen the nation of Israel am been through the Divine realm so the way God helped Israel was not through a natural way it was through a spiritual way amen through a Divine realm he said that can help American tonight through the Divine Realm amen out of all this oh God Church of the Living God I feel like preaching now if I can introduce to you no matter what you're going through no matter what you're facing if I can introduce to you the Divine realm and you can get in contact with that Divine realm then he will speak back and say you're coming out of it I feel the Holy Ghost with on that one amen you're coming out of it I'm going to labor there for a second I don't know what you're in I don't know what you're going through but the word of the Lord says you're coming out of it you're coming out of it you can't stay there you can't lay there you can't dry up there you can't die there the

you're too close to a breakthrough you're too close to a miracle you're too close to an answer I say House of Hell give way to the name of Jesus Christ we're coming out of the situations we're coming out of the dark days we're coming out of the Lonely hours we're coming out of the depression we're coming out of it we're coming out of it I said we're coming out of it devil you can't stop it devil

who the son made free is free inde deed we're coming out of it see there's a vision yes sir brother I don't feel like it what's greater the word of your feelings come on well brother Andrew I failed God too many times what's greater your failures or the vision I'm preaching to you this morning or if you only knew the things I did and the things I said and the way I reacted Under Pressure you wouldn't say there's no hope for me but is that condition greater than the vision the vision now look at Proverbs 29:18 where there is no vision the people prosper and they do well and no they perish look at this word Vision it is an oracle it is prophecy it is divine communication oh God in other words it is communication about you that transcends what the things around you are saying in other words oh how can I say this to you in other words amen a vision opens up another level of communication so like if something's going on brother Mark uh I don't know I'm going to make it real simple and dumb okay amen if that chair is there and it needs to get in the room but there's no door here and that room's closed off if me and you sit down and start talking about how we going to get that chair we're communicating but we have no Authority but then all of a sudden if a vision breaks if a vision breaks then all of a sudden we've now received divine intervention from a from from a perfect Dimension and the vision shows us that there's going to be a wall here but there's going to be a stone coming in oh God I'm preaching now there's going to be a stone com in and it's going to put a hole in that in that wall and we're going to take that chair through there in other words we're coming out of here in other words that chair by vision is coming out of what it's in oh church are you hearing me are you hearing me you say well brother Andrew if we're going to have a vision we got to have some special gift Ed preacher Amen to come stand on the platform and say oh o I feel I see I no we have a Vindicated prophet's message which is a vision from the almighty God and it's perfectly interpretated yes sir can I say this to you a vision brings hope sister Destiny a vision brings hope in the middle of whatever's going on if a vision comes a vision brings hope in Hopeless situations amen amen I don't know why the lord gave this to me last night but I'll say this thank God for it cuz it's the right place to have it in 1953 expectations in Jonesboro Arkansas he said by the way is that man here is that little girl here I'd like to see her again see I don't know what his name was somebody says Morgan it's a good name to have the name Morgan buddy amen somebody says Morgan amen Morgan he says Mr Morgan i' like to see the little girl again while we're in the country she's from

time I seen her amen she was just a child oh God but now he's wanting to see her and she hasn't gone back from the last time he saw her brother Carter she's Advanced amen from a young child into a

in brother Johnson's car he said I seen a vision come before me I seen a vision come before me and Water started running like that I seen the little girl going down along the side of the waters and he said now go tell him waters are running clear ahead somebody give me some shouting Elbow Room in the house of God the vision broke she's laying there dying but when the vision come Kyle brother K the vision said there's Waters and those waters are running and those waters are not running backwards those waters are not running backwards those waters are running clear and they're running clear ahead he said oh my the third day oh there's something about that third day amen the third day the little girl was in school when they would standing there pumping oxygen to her said there's no hopes but when all hope is gone then he is our hopes what are you saying preacher I'm saying she was laying there dying she was laying there drying up she was laying there perishing she couldn't even breathe for her own self they were having to pump oxygen into her but then all of a sudden there was a vision broke and in the vision there were some Waters and the waters were running clear and the waters were running straight ahead you know what that's telling me me that the little girl's future was a lot brighter than where she was at right now well I'm going to have church if I got to have it by myself you know what that tells me that tells me that if she would accept that Vision she would advance from a dying condition she would progress from a dying condition into a perfectly normal child

next step could be into the future home [Applause] you know why I'm not getting depressed and I'm not going to lay down and quit the devil's giv me every reason to but you know why I'm not going to is because as he is in the light then I'm walking in that light and I'm maturing with that light and I can now stand here and say I can stand here under maturity of the word of God and say this our next step that's right Hallelujah [Applause] brother Jared our next step could be out of time into eternity some of yall worried about tomorrow and your next step could be sitting at the marriage supper of the Lamb of God some of y'all sitting right here right now and you're missing loved ones can I say this amen quit worrying about how many more days it's going to be and receive the word of the Lord it could be this very moment that they walking through this room and they get you by the hand and they say come on we're going to get out of here let's go on hey I feel I feel like preaching we're leaving here Church our bodies are going to be changed our loved ones are going to raise and the devil's going to be under our [Applause] feet quit worrying there's no hope left but the second coming of the Lord Jesus tonight can I can can I tie this together y'all forgive me I'm tur into a serious preacher around here but it feels good when the Lord comes in the room don't it coming out outcome I'm living with the expectations coming out of it that's right tonight the only hope of the church is to get away from their man-made theologies and get back to the Holy Spirit and get the spirit back in the church and get the church straightened out that's brother I don't know about you but that sounds like divine order to me get the manm the IES out of the church and get back to the Holy Spirit I'm feeling good now Wesley get the manmade theologies out of the chur want Talk balance Let's Talk balance okay get the manmade theologies out of the church that's got you down and empty and then get the spirit of God in the church wait sorry get back to the Holy Spirit and then get the spirit back in the church amen and get the church straightened out so the message of Malachi 4 is going to get the manmade theologies out of the church it's going to get the SP it's going to get the church back to the Holy Spirit then going to get the spirit back in the church yeah and get the church straightened out in other words it can only be done by a prophet can I say this to you it will take a prophet to straighten it out that's you say brother Andrew how can you say that can I have a few more minutes here because the Holy Ghost was bound Feast of trumpets go read it was bound by these denominational Rivers for some 2,000 years but is to be loosed in the evening time oh god brother Joe is to be loosed in the evening time amen under the evening time message are you hearing me amen I'm I'm I'm turning the corner now brother Bobby amen all the way 2,000 years brother Braham comes on the scene and what does he start doing he starts talking about what happened 2,000 years ago at Calvary and says that's a finished work amen but do you see between Calvary and then and now or between let me how uh how do I say this between Calvary and then there was denominational rivers that were blocking the Holy Ghost on one side of the atonement am I making sense honestly I'm asking you you've got the atonement you've got the holy ghost moving towards the people released from the atonement but then you got denominational walls that stop and the atonement and the Holy Ghost is on this side and the denominational walls here and the people's on that side so now they're going to psychology to get help and they're going to schools to learn the Bible come on church and they're studying through all kinds of man-made theologies and the church has filled up with it but in the end time behold I send you Elijah the prophet and he's not going to play footy under the table he's not going to politic around the table he's not going to play with denominations he's going to stand in the pullit and he's going to turn to Revelation and he's going to say that is a system it is the mark of the beast it is the enemy of God and in the name of Jesus Christ I resent it and he tore the wall down and Church of the Living God Brother Don there was a gusher of the Holy Ghost amen broke out in the people well I want to close by saying this this morning that Holy Ghost was liberated by prophets message and there ain't no devil and there ain't no preacher and there ain't no Theology and there ain't no feeling got any right to bind up the gusher of the Holy Ghost I say open the windows of Heaven Lord and let the Holy Ghost gush in Grace Tabernacle let the power of God let the waters run clear now brother B said this he said you're going to have it a few days in the book for me Church age book you know what I'm talking about church age book raise your hand you got church age book okay if you don't you need to get it it's a powerful book brother BR writes that book and he sent it to a man you'll hear his name on the tapes he sent it to a man named leil who was a who was a a a theologian best I can say it politely we'll move on so so brother Veil takes this because I said like this he takes this this church age book and I want to I want to say this in defense of of brother brandom brother Veil they brother veale did not write that book can we can we settle that it's not Lil's book it's brother brandom's book Lil grammar ised grammar ised is different than writing amen right say amen amen just kidding my wife's an author writing something and grammaring something that's different okay people say well you don't need to get in that church age book that's just brother veil's thoughts well you're looking at one preacher that's got enough backbones to say that's heresy you need to get in that book you need to take your Bible and you need to lay that church age book down side by side and you need to go through it and hear what a prophet said about the time of Gentile dispensation you're living in okay I don't know why I said that but we said it it's out there now let's move on so he sends what he calls an audio letter to Lil about the church age book and I'm going to close on this quote right here he says now in order to Proclaim this so what he's proclaiming the book he says in order to Proclaim this has to send a prophet in order to inject this to make this real again to show the people the hour we're living in because if they only see it in the hour past then there's no hope for the church if they only see the Bible in the hour past if they only read Genesis Revelation in the our pastor there's no hope for the church that's the church must see it in the present tense so God sends his Prophet to manifest the present tense of it y'all remember brother Tim sermon you got a road map you don't know where you're at how do we get from here to there you can't move you can't advance until somebody shows you where you're at so we're in this condition we're in this problem we're in this situation we're in this fear we're in this battle we're in this trial we're in this confusion we're in all this but then all of a sudden there's a man here who can turn on the light and when the light begins to Shine the Light brings opportunities can I say this and those opportunities are opportunities for miracles if a prophet hadn't come and turned on the light there would be no miracles in the church but he turned on the light brother Manuel do you realize if you go in a room and the room is full of roaches and there's no lights do you realize you don't go in there and stomp the roaches out and then turn the lights on you turn the lights on then you let the light do the work to identify the roach then you stomp on it God I feel like preaching all over again there's some roaches that's right there's some roaches that's right and they've crept in places they shouldn't be come on Church they've crept in play oh God they've crept in on your praise and they shouldn't be there they crept in on your Camp experience and they shouldn't be there come on now they crept in on your fellowship and they shouldn't be there they crept on your back in the word and they shouldn't be there so God turns on the light come on Church the light does the work the light reveals where the roach is and the light anoints you to put your foot on that devil and say you've crept in long enough well come on Church them roaches is crept in and crept in and crept in and they got you talking language now we can't get out we can't get out we can't get out but God has turned on the light rise up this morning and shine thy light has come and put your foot on the head of that devil and let the light of the Glorious gospel make the promises of God real again let our musicians come this morning hallelujah hallelujah we're coming out of it we're coming out of it brother Joel we're coming out of it don't matter what it looks like we're coming out of it y'all just forgive me we're coming out of it we're coming out of it your family's coming out of it your marriage is coming out of it your home is coming out of it come on Church your finances are coming out of it your health is coming out you're coming out of it come on some of y'all need to back that right now stronger than you do the bill you got in the mail yesterday come on Church you need to back that right now stronger in the way things are looking you need to back the word of God again back the word of God back the promises of God come on let the Holy Ghost sweep through your soul and sweep out all the depression sweep out all the anxiety sweep out all the confusion sweep out all the loneliness sweep Out All the nervousness sweep out all the confusion let the Holy Ghost blow for the church again we're coming out of [Music] it Hallelujah can I say it that's that sayith the word of God we're coming out of it sister Judy I don't care what it looks like we're coming out of it the devil can't have our health the devil can't have our peace the devil can't have our strength he's a liar and he's the father of lies and the word of God condemns him this morning in the presence of God condemn the condemner this morning condemn the condem her this morning it's your opportunity to do it I want you to stand to your feet with us today brother what we need to do is sew the gospel seed of the word of the power of the resurrection of Christ The Living being that's living with us in us now present [Music] tense somebody somebody somebody challenge you or push you around on believing a prophet can I give you something can I give you something somebody say well brother I think it's a little far fets to say the only way the church can get straightened out is it takes a prophet but listen what what what he says God promised Malachi 4 for this last day and Malachi 4 has not yet been fulfilled uh don't put it up yet but can you get Psalms 341 ready for me Malachi 4 has not yet been fulfilled now this is 1962 but it must be fulfilled for it's a gered word of God spoken through Malachi the prophet you believe that Jesus referred to it do you believe that it is just before the coming of Christ the second time all scripture that has not been fulfilled must be before that time the Bible is to be finished the Gentile dispensation is to be finished with the church age when this anointed messenger arrives now can I can can I show you how he's going to straighten the church out he will plant the seed of the entire [Music] Bible Plum from the serpent to the messenger in the former Reign then he will be rejected by the people as his forefather John Elijah as was spoken by our Lord he comes back and says what we need today brother is show The Gospel seed of the word of the power resurrection of Christ The Living being that's living with us in us now present tense okay can I say this to you the way he corrects the church is he swws the entire word seed Bible in the church then when that seed begins to grow what does it do it takes over the way you handle every situation it takes over the way you look at things it takes over the way you approach situations can I say it to you like this in other words it makes you start and I didn't get to it but I'm going to say it like this it makes you start seizing the Supreme moment it makes you quit looking at Golden opportunities going by you it makes you grab them yes sir yeah but the only way you can do it is there's got to be a recognition that this is your time to do it and you can do it can you help me preach for a second can you look at somebody next to you and say you can do [Music] it you're allowed to do it are you hearing me I remember I was preaching out in CL uh out in barville Oklahoma one time and there was a brother God Rest his soul he's gone on be with the Lord he is a he was a Native American and he was telling me we got talking he said where are you from he said you got a he said you got a Southern accent I said well I'm from Tennessee he said I a tell he said I over there one time he said I was down there in Gatlinburg and he said I was sitting up on my on my porch in my cabin and he said I was looking over the cabin porch and he said there was a stream and brother Wesley he said the most beautiful trout was just going right down that stream and he said I was just propped up you know looking over at him and he said I was thinking man I wish I go down there and catch some of them babies he said I got to looking at the price of license and I said don't even talk to about it I know he said y'all States crazy on visitor's license he said I got to look him and he said I thought I ain't paying that to fish for one day I've just got one one opportunity he said I ain't going to pay fish that day he said but I'm just going to sit there watching he said I got home got talking to my buddies and he said my buddy looked at me and he said let me see your driver's license he said I showed it to him he said do you see this symbol on your driver's license he said you are a Native American he said that symbol gives you the privilege to hunt or fish anywhere anytime any place you want to under legal rules you don't have to buy a license you don't have to go he said but Andrew he said I sat there and watched him and I had the ability in my pocket to go catch them church are you hearing me how long you going to sit here and look at blessings going by and God has G you the ability to catch them you see the blessings going right through the atmosphere you see the word you you you come on you know what I'm talking about you see that you see that high place you can live in

your outcome the vision sees the expectation the vision actually is the ground of Hope the word hope means Grounds for Hope so in other words if there's going to be hope there's got to be grounds for
