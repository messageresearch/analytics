thank the Lord for the opportunity to come this morning and and uh just to be able to uh to be able to speak the word of God and don't have much of an ability but I know that God is able uh to bring his word to life amen you believe that I wanted just to make a quick announcement before we uh got into the word of God uh we have our uh anniversary meeting uh that is is set on February the 27th through March the 2nd so it's the same weekend that we done the meeting last year and uh so that'll be on Thursday through that Sunday and uh speaking for us uh for that meeting we have brother uh Wayne Lawson will be here brother Josh Bennett and brother Donnie Reagan they've all agreed to come and be a part of the meeting so we're looking forward to a real outpouring of the Holy Ghost amen so I believe that God has something in store for his church and uh you know that's I believe that every time we come in the house of God it ought to be a time to celebrate life and celebrate uh the things that God has done for us and uh we just we believe that you believe that this morning amen we just want to remember in prayer it says pray for Conan Roberts has a bad cough and I just pray for over him he's been sick so much uh from his mom and unspoken uh prayer request uh for Connor and Brook and when I believe that God knows all things amen can we just approach the Lord and and just ask

morning let's just bow our heads gracious Heavenly Father Lord how we love you today Lord we're so thankful for a another opportunity just to come and to Fellowship around your word and God we realize the we weakness of our flesh and that Lord we just come to rely upon you Lord knowing that we wouldn't be able to say anything that could help anybody but Lord if you had just come and speak a word lord it's enough that would change hearts and lives forever Lord we just ask you that you would come Lord that you would make your presence known in this assembly this morning God we don't come to gain glory for ourselves Lord but we come to give you glory Lord we just ask you Lord that you would take this mouthpiece and speak to your church and Lord as hearers Lord may we be anointed to hear the word of God and Lord we'll just be careful to give you the glory for all that you do Lord I pray that you would heal those that are sick those families that are in need God that you would touch each one Lord that we would go from this place and we would know that we've been in your presence Lord we thank you for all that you do for us in Jesus name we ask and the church says amen amen you love the Lord this morning man we just want to invite you to the Book of Ezekiel in the first chapter and we'll read out of the fourth verse starting there uh just want to welcome our visitors here this morning just may God bless you and Trust something that would be said that would be edifying uh to you amen how we enjoy those uh specials this morning and I just enjoy uh the right atmosphere amen just people to come and you know all it takes is a people that will get out of the way and let God Amen if we can do that then God moves in a special way amen so we just want to read out of the Book of Ezekiel we going to start in the first chapter in the fourth verse and and um I know I kind of held a little uh long uh last week and brother Mark said I hadn't preached but two times I don't know how how many but certainly a little more but maybe I was trying to make up for it last week but I won't do that to you this morning so somebody keep an eye on me but Ezekiel the first chapter I know they have the uh the the dinner and today and so I don't want to get everybody's mind I don't want to be like brother Tim Pur that day he said he turned into two pizzas so I don't want to be two pizzas this morning amen we just we just want to be able to preach the word and it be effective amen so I want to read out of Ezekiel uh the the first chapter the fourth verse the Bible says and I looked and behold a whirlwind came out of the North a great cloud and a fire including or infolding itself and a brightness was about it and out of the midst thereof as the color of amber out of the midst of the fire also out of the midst thereof came the likeness of four living creatures and this was their appearance they had the likeness of a man and every one of them had four faces and everyone had four wings now I want to read down at the 10th verse the Bible says As for the likeness of their faces because here's where we're focusing this morning as for the likeness of their faces they they for had the face of a man and the face of a lion on the right side and the four had the face of an ox on the left side and the face of an eagle eag and I want to take this this morning and I would like to preach on an eagle standard and we'll just allow you to take your seats this morning on an eagle standard amen we just certainly I know we certainly couldn't get into all of this this morning and uh uh there's so many wonderful things in this scripture that we could uh go through but I just want to uh maybe kind of go in the direction we had started last week and and uh I believe that we have a purpose in this life amen as a church how many believe that we have a purpose as a body of Believers and I believe that our purpose is to spread this Full Gospel message to the world and I believe that God has allotted that to us that's our allotment to be able to spread uh this gospel I know everybody has their their own calls to spread but this is ours brother wesle this is what God has given to us and you know sometimes that uh that we get people on our heart and we go to praying for them or a person or a family on our heart and I think that's a wonderful thing you know to pray for people and pray for their salvation and pray that uh that the Lord would bring them in and you know don't quit because I believe prayer Works how many believe that I I believe it works and I believe Prayer Changes Things so don't quit praying for them but uh but if you want to see a transformation in somebody's life or or a family the only way to see a transformation is you can't stop at the prayer there has to be some more things that are done I I remember reading out of U out of apostle Paul and when he went in in went into jail remember the book of Acts and they had put him in jail and the Bible said whenever whenever they were in this jail that in in their time of being in prison there was a Jailer and his family was converted how many remember that you know what it was it wasn't just the prayer of apostle Paul and and Silas that converted the family but while he was in that jail cell the Bible says that they were locked in prison and they began to pray and to sing songs to God and make an atmosphere and all of a sudden a great earthquake came and the earthquake it it it tore down the jail cell it opened up all the doors it broke all the chains that were binding them and and as it was broke you notice here the Bible said they sang and they praised God in other words they created an atmosphere in the prison cell that brought the power of God to where they were and when the power of God came the power of God is what made a way of Escape it wasn't just a way of Escape for Paul and Silas but it was a way of Escape for the Jailer and his family and I thought you know that's the way it is with us we've all been bound at some point every one of us we've all been prisoners to something there's something there may be a mental battle maybe a struggle or something that we've been abound by but you know what God has done in this hour as God has provided a way of Escape I say God done that in every hour he's always provided a way of escape to the Believers and you notice that God's provision not only does it free you brother Wesley but it provides a testimony IT Supplies a faith-building testimony to those that are around you so when God frees you and he supplies a way of Escape for you it provides a way a testimony for those uh that look at your life it's a faith-building testimony that God has given you and I realize it this morning that you're and I want you to hear this before I get into my message that your testimony provides a way of Escape for others your testimony that you're living in the life that you live it provides a way of Escape for the people that are around you don't you see what that's what happened they there's people around you that they may be hanging on by a thread and your testimony is the very things that is going to turn things around for them it's what's going to it's what's going to bring them home you see how important your testimony is brother Mark how you how you react to the word and how how you receive the word of God and how you live this gospel it is a it will turn people their lives that are barely hanging on it'll turn them to the Gospel of Jesus Christ can I can I give you some free pastoring this morning we may we may as well we're going we're going to preach anyhow but but but but but you realize that that people see your life and they see your testimony that means they see everything that you say they see everything that you post they they hear the words that you speak and I know sometimes we wonder L Lord Lord help me this morning but you know sometimes you wonder why people won't go to church with me let me tell you why that is a lot of times is a lot of times that people's testimony is a negative testimony and you let me tell you a secret there's never a negative testimony ever w a single soul a negative testimony it don't win people it ain't going to win them to the Lord it ain't going to cause them to have a desire to go to church with you how many believe the Bible this morning I believe the Bible and I believe the Bible gives us the answer to all things I believe the Bible it's it's been established in this hour and so I I believe that we God has given us a direction he's given us a direction a way to live and a way to find escape and a way to get our families out of this place of bondage and and God has given us that how many believes that do do you believe Apostle Paul go ahead and let me know it I just I don't say that to be smart but I I want to know how many believe Apostle Paul how many believe him to be a man of God that was sent by God to be a messenger to the Gentile church and do you believe that this morning how so so if you believe that how many can say I believe Ephesians the 4th chapter I believe that it was inspired by God how how believe that say Amen how many that can accept Paul's letter to the Church of Ephesians and say I don't just believe it was a letter to the Ephesians but I believe that was a letter to me how many say that this morning I believe that God wrote that for me and so so that means that the words that Paul spoke that that that it wasn't to another person or or it wasn't just to somebody else but it was just for me and how many believes that Paul's word that he spoke that there ain't no angel from heaven that could come and preach something different that would that would be greater than what Paul has already spoke how many believe that I believe him to be a messenger of God I believe Ephesians 4 to be anointed of God so let well let's just read it this morning here's what he said so when Paul said that there's one Lord and one faith and one baptism and one God and Father of all he's above all and he's through all and he's in you all how many can say Amen to that that's Ephesians 4 Apostle Paul you say you mean the father of all the father's in me I thought I thought it was the Holy Ghost well it's the same Spirit of the father is the same spirit that was in the Holy Ghost and he's the same one that's dwelling in the heart of the Believers this morning how many believe that see do you accept it or do you resent it it's the word of God we have an opportunity every time we hear the word of God pre to preach to either be able to accept it or do we resent the word of God let me tell you what Paul said he said he that descended is the same one that ascended Above All The Heavens that he might fill all things so in other word that same Jesus that was on the cross of Calvary the one that descended he's the same one that descended to the throne he's the same one that descended to the bottomless pit that overcome the devil and and overcome all of hell and overcome death he said he is the same one that came in this hour to fill all things so that same Jesus that same father that same Holy Ghost he's the one that is fing us this morning do you accept it or do you resent it see this is Ephesians the 4th chapter Paul said and he gave some Apostles and some prophets and some evangelists and some pastors and teachers for the protecting of the Saints for the work of the ministry for the edifying of the body of Christ until we all come in the unity of the faith and the knowledge of the Son of God unto a perfect man unto the measure of the stature of the fullness of God do you accept it or do you resent it see it's Ephesians 4 this is the same chapter I'm not I'm not changed books on you it's the same chapter it's still Ephesians 4 how many say Amen to it it's God's word so God sends his prophets he sends evangelists he sends teachers he sends pastors how many believe in the five-fold ministry this morning why because it was Apostle Paul that spoke it in Ephesians 4 it was an anointed word it was anointed oh let me tell you what I'm looking at this I'm looking at a group of pites this morning man we're we're just a bunch of pites that believe the message of apostle Paul we're a bunch of polites if father you can call us what you want to but I believe he was an anointed man of God a messenger that was sent from God and we're still preaching that same message this morning and it's still just as anointed as it was in the days of Paul when he walk walked along the road and he preached and and he took those that were sick and brought healing to their body and he spoke the very Mind Of God I still believe it this morning do you accept it or do you resent it what are we anyhow think about it Paul said let me tell you if we're if we're going to believe Ephesians 4 let me tell you about our Our Testimony Paul said let no communication this is me pastoring let no corrupt communication proceed out of your mouth Ephesians 4 verse 29 but he but that which is good into the of edifying that it may Minister grace to the hearers and grieve not the holy spirit of God whereby you were sealed into the day of redemption but let all bitterness and wrath and anger and clamor and evil speaking be put away with all malice and be kind one to another tenderhearted forgive one another even as God for Christ's sake has forgiven you Ephesians 4 do you accept it or do you resent it the Amplified Bible would say it like this let no foul or polluting language nor evil word nor UNH wholesome or worthless talk ever come out of your mouth but only such speech as is good and beneficial to the spiritual progress of others as is fitting to the need and the occasion that it may be a blessing and give Grace in other words God's favor to those that hear it my I say we have a testimony this morning we have a message to share we have a testimony and God has given us our testimony that it would provide a way of Escape is't that something what Paul's testim done you watch that Jailer and whenever the the walls opened up and the Bible said the Jailer came to them he said what must we do to be saved remember he was so anointed by by or moved by the the the the gift that Paul had you realize that Paul prophesied unto him here Paul being a prophet of God the Bible said the Jailer I'm I'm not going to get to my message this morning but the Bible said the Jailer he thought in his heart that they had escaped from the jail and he took his own sword to take himself in the middle of the darkness but Apostle Paul was sitting there in the dark and knew what the man was thinking and he called out unto him and said don't take your own life don't you worry sir but we're all still here he was going to take his life because he thought here the the ones I've been given charge over had escaped but Paul being anointed of God being a prophet of God knew what happened in the middle of the dark he said don't worry sir we're all still sitting here and the Bible says when he heard Paul cry out he lit him a light and went down to the feet of Paul and asked him what must I do to be saved he saw a prophet of God being able to discern his heart in the middle of the night and discern the very thoughts of his heart and when a prophet of God called out what was going on in his heart he fell down at his feet and he said what must I do to be saved and Paul said believe on the Lord Jesus Christ and you and your house will be saved and he began to preach unto him the word of the Lord and all that were in his house and the Bible says and that Jailer took him that same night into his house and they were baptized straight away and they went now and they they were brought out of the house and they rejoiced and they believed in God and all of his house believed Now isn't that something it wasn't just a testimony it wasn't just that he was praying for him but he shared the gospel verse 31 he was told to believe in the Lord in verse 32 Paul and Silas shared the news about Jesus with his family in verse 33 they took a hold of the Gospel that was preached to him and they expressed their faith outwardly and they went down to a water and they were baptized a watery grave and were baptized in the water and then in verse 34 they went away rejoicing at their new found salvation see that's the gospel story in my opinion I believe we ought to pray for one another but we ought to testify we have a testimony we have a gospel to preach and when a person can take a hold of that gospel it'll save a whole family it'll cause them to go turn away from their old way of thinking and turn away from their old teaching and all the things that Satan has been trying to put on their mind and it'll cause them to turn back to God and in their turning to God they they'll see the salvation of the Lord and then they'll go away rejoicing why cuz they found the new found favor with God it's wonderful to pray but proclaim the gospel have a testimony I believe as Believers that's what we have to do this morning is we are spreading this Full Gospel message to the world you realize the responsibility that's been given to us I see our testimony it's going to bring forth a fruit you believe that you're the the the the church it's going to manifest the fruit of what's being planted or manif EST the fruit of what's being preached and I know there's a lot of churches and they preach a lot of different things but you realize that that that the fruit of the church is manifested by what seed is planted into it so I believe that we ought to plant the right seed I think sometimes people get so far off on one side or the other and they failed to plant the right seed or the True Heart of what the gospel was or what was being said that's why we guard the pull pit we don't just let anybody have an opportunity to stand behind this desk and to preach the gospel because we guard the pull pit that the word of God can go for so that people don't lose respect for the pull Pitter they don't lose respect for the gospel there's been so many things so many my goodness there's so many uh awful things been said behind pull pits that that men have built that cause people to lose faith in God and lose faith in Ministry and lose faith in in what God has brought them to in this hour but I thank God that we still have a place to go to that he can restore our faith and that very thing that men has tore down that God has provided a place that it could be restored again oh friend don't let let me take tell you this morning you don't have to remain in a bound State you don't have to remain in a confused State you don't have to accept everything that everybody tells you that God has given us a place to go this morning that the very faith that he gave you the first time you knelt down at an altar that that same faith can be restored right here today it's a place that God has provided so we guard it because we want a certain fruit you say well what kind of fruits it going to bring forth you you've heard me preach it before but the B but but the the prophet would tell it like this he said the church is going to have to produce the right kind of children the church World think about it they're producing children they they have a seed in there because they're bringing forth children all the time but they're not bringing forth the right kind of children it's all those Society types and all all this cold and formal types he said but the only church that the word of God would bring forth is a screaming hollering blabbering acts 238 miserable creatures that the world thinks they are I don't care what the world thinks about them brother Wesley but that's the only kind of church that the word of God will produce how many say Amen to it this morning that's the only kind the church world don't want that kind of seed you know they don't want that kind of children so they don't plant that kind of seed but that's the only kind of children that the word of God is going to produce it'll produce Full Gospel children that's the kind of children that the word will manifest Born Again Holy Ghost filled children of God that's why we're a Full Gospel Church because we're preaching a full you know it's so odd I was speaking of this last Sunday people have been told so many things they don't even know what they are anymore they're so confused if somebody asked you what they are they've been down so many uh trails and heard so many things they don't even know how to identify themselves and what they are I thought I I spoke it last Sunday I said we're a Full Gospel Church somebody kind of some people kind of looked at me funny but let me say it this morning to make it a better understanding we are a fundamental Full Gospel Bible Church let me make it make it a better understanding I want everybody to know where I stand this morning that's what we are as a body of Believers you know some people are afraid to say that because they they've been so twisted up in their theology they don't know even know what it is to be a Full Gospel Church anymore but it ain't something new a Full Gospel that that came all the way back from what Jesus was you think about many many associate that I I might as well get in here I'm already here brother Tom he's a historian but you know many associate this term with a fourfold gospel remember in the 1800s in Canada there was this great movement called The four-fold Gospel remember Amy mcferson a great sister that went out and she started a great movement you realize that today that the movement she started which was called The Four Square movement it came from that Full Gospel teaching and that four square movement here that that that that her fundamentals were that God that Christ was a savior A sanctifier A Healer and the oncoming King so that was the the four parts the four bases of her of of her belief but but you realize that the foundation of that four square movement that happened in the 1800s she would take this and say she she would change that that that four parts and she'd say well he's a savior and he's a filler of the Holy Ghost he's a Healer and a king and she started that movement and today there's 8 million people that follow that same movement they you know and here uh later that mainstream Pentecost they took that same thing and they combined that fourfold with the four square and so now they said there's that that Christ is all five things so they they combine the two things that sister mcferson had and they say in the mainstream Pentecost said he's a savior he's a sanctifier and he's a filler of the Holy Ghost he a Healer and he's a king but let me tell you something this morning do you realize that as a body of Believers that we still believe all five of those things I still believe that he's a savior I believe he's a sanctifier I believe he's a filler of the Holy Ghost I believe he's a Healer and I still believe he's a king but where we differ in our Doctrine is we differ in the evidence of the Holy Ghost is being the speaking of tongues because people had manufactured it and they would force people to speak in tongues and beat them on the chin and make them say some words to prove that they had the Holy Ghost we differ in the bapt the baptism being baptized with titles and not having a revelation of who the Lord Jesus Christ was we differ in forming denominations and and following after man-made Ministries and and building up hierarchies that that men would rule over the church we differ in in the spirit of nanism where where the Ley would be conquered by by the ministry or by Bishops we differ in all those things we differ in that the Holy Ghost is the ruler over the church the Holy Ghost is the is the head of the church that that's what this message has produced is a Bible Church that's being led by the Holy Ghost not to be a bunch of man followers and people at following after the theologies of some man but the only theology we have is the Bible it's the Gospel of Jesus Christ it's been anointed in this hour it was came it came down on the cross of Calvary it spoke in the in the book of Acts and it's the same gospel that's being preached this morning that was the need for a word Prophet is to get people away from all those things and back to a true Bible Church to point the people back to a to a Bible gospel back to a true Full Gospel but you know even in all that here when brother Brown came you realized that he was still not disrespectful you realize that when he preached the message the Masterpiece how many remember that message you've all heard it you remember the great moving message of the Masterpiece and how that he had talked about going down and seeing Michelangelo and the statue or or the statue of Moses remember how it been struck and he said it became God's Masterpiece how many knows where he was at whenever he saw that statue to see when he saw it he was actually visiting the tomb of Amy mcferson with her son and let me tell you how he said about it he said you know even though I differ I don't agree in women preachers and I differ in some of the beliefs but but I went down to pay my respects and I paid a tribute to her and we went down to her grave and I stood there with my hat off and I bowed my head and I gave thanks to God for a noble life of his little handmaid watch the difference the way that people treat one another today but that was never the nature I know what they're trying to do today they're trying to paint the nature of a prophet and make him something that he wasn't but I don't accept that I don't accept what people say that he was and the nature that he was and this was his motive and this was all that but this was a true heart said I I may not agree with it but I still wanted to honor what God had done with her life I think that's the way we ought to be today I may not agree with you we may not see everything to eye to eye but I still want to honor what God has done with her life be still respectful to one another you know why because she stood for many true things the Full Gospel it wasn't sister McPherson's movement it wasn't a Pentecost movement it was a Jesus movement it was a Jesus movement listen today people take their families to all kinds of churches here's what a prophet said he said if I was choosing a church he said I'd choose a genuine fundamental Full Gospel Bible Church if I was looking for a church to put my family in he said that's the only kind of church I'd take my family to I know people say it don't matter you can go to wherever Church you want to but I'm just saying what a prophet said that's the only kind of church I'd put my family in can I say it a little bit further than that he said it's the only kind of church that Jesus would preach in is a Full Gospel Church he said why would it be the only church he would preach in because he was the Full Gospel he couldn't deny himself brother wesle Full Gospel Church it teaches that Jesus is the Full Gospel he's the fullness of the word of God a fundamental Full Gospel Church it teaches that Jesus is the son of God but it also teaches that he was God in flesh it teaches that he was all God but it also teaches that he was all men it teaches that when he went down to the tomb you say Where's that in the Bible when he went down to the tomb of Lazarus and the Bible said that he had compassion upon them the man that was Jesus that old man he be to weep at the tomb why because he felt that their compassion they were they were his friends and when he stood there and wept he was all man but when he walked down to the tomb and he called Lazarus by name and a dead man got up and walked out of the Grave it had nothing to do with a man it was God himself calling a dead to rise a Full Gospel Church it teaches Hebrews 13 and8 what God was he still is so if he was a savior I feel like preaching this morning if he was a savior then he still is a savior if he was a Healer he still Is A Healer if he was a sanctifier he's still a sanctifier if he ever filled with the Holy Ghost he still fills with the Holy Ghost he was crowned the king of glory and he's still the king of glory he's the king of righteousness he's the king of Peace Zachariah said Rejoice oh Daughter of Zion Oh daughter of Jerusalem for Behold thy King cometh unto thee and ha salvation he's a king of kings he's coming to thee to bring Salvation you say what do he come for he's coming to save coming to catch the church away Behold thy King is Coming glory to God and he has salvation he said well what's he coming for let me tell you what the Bible said as it was in the days of Noah so shall it be in the coming of the son of man I got a minute to preach now got that off my chest as it was in the days of Noah so shall it be in the coming of the son of man the Bible said in the same day that lot went out of Sodom it raised fire and brimstone from heaven and Destroy them all even thus shall it be in the day when the son of man is revealed said notice it was not the Son of God no more it was the son of man he would come back as this prophetic age and the eagle would be flying now how many so so listen this this age or this day in other words he said it would be the day of the eagle how many knows this reference the day of the eagle watch we read it read it in Ezekiel Ezekiel said I looked and behold a whirlwind came out of the North a great cloud and folding itself brightness midst their of in the midst there was a likeness of living creatures in their appearance they had the likeness of a man everyone had four faces and four wings one had the face of a lion one of a man one of an ox and one of an eagle now notice as Ezekiel would make this plain this is in the first chapter but in Ezekiel the 10th chapter the 15th verse Ezekiel would say these were choms he said I saw them they were lifted up remember they had four wings he said they were living creatures that I saw by the river chear so that so but in the Old Testament it would show us that these cherubs that Ezekiel saw that and as he would explain what they look like that that in the Old Testament they were protectors or guards and how many how many how many realize the first time we saw this in the Bible you actually see it in the Garden of Eden remember uh the Bible says after man had fell in the garden and God had pushed him out of the garden that he set up to block the way to the Tree of Life what did God set in the east of the garden he said I set up chams that were there see they were guards and they had flaming swords that went Every Which Way that would guard the way of the Tree of Life so you realize that this is uh these these choms they were guards this is what Ezekiel was seeing see but you realize they guarded because it was only granted by those that God would Grant access so here if God would give you if it was God's purpose that you'd have access to that then you'd be able to get past the guard and you realize that no man could go without invitation and and I say it this this way this morning they were effective guards so for thousands of years no one had access to this tree of life it was it was guarded it was guarded now watch the spiritual uh type of this it was guarded so for thousands of years here that God had established guards these great chones that would guard over these spiritual things but now but now notice we see this again remember thinking of guards we see this again when God would give Moses the instruction to build the Ark of the Covenant notice in Exodus 25th chapter he said when you build the ark make two choms of gold and beaten work in the two ends on the two ends of The Mercy Seat make one CH on one end and one CH on the other that The Mercy Seat she the chals have two will be on the two ends and they will stretch forth their wings on high covering the mercy seat with their wings and their faces shall look one to another toward the mercy seat that the shall the faces of the chams be and that shall put The Mercy Seat above upon the ark and the Ark shall be put the you shall put the testimony that I shall give thee and there I will meet with thee and I will commune with thee from above the mercy Sea from between the two choms of which are upon the Ark of the testimony the things which I will give commandment unto the children of Israel so in other words here what God gives order he said here is the Ark of the testimony here is here is The Mercy Seat here is where Moses would go to hear the order that God would give him to be able to speak to the children of Israel but even in this place in even the The Mercy Seat in the ark of the testimony here once again we find these great cherums that God has placed watch's the spiritual typ again we find these choms that God has placed as a guard Over The Mercy Seat or or a guard over the Ark of testimony so we realize you say well what were they guarding they were guarding uh that they were guarding this testimony or or the Ark of the Covenant I think I think this is so powerful because in ezekiel's Vision notice what he sees he said they had four faces one had the face of a lion one the face of a of an ox the other a face of a man and then fourth the face of an eagle how many members those same four things is the same four faces that John saw in Revelations the fourth chapter remember he saw the same types but notice how John worded it he said and he saw in around the Throne of God he said they he called them beasts he said the first Beast was like a lion the second beast was like a calf the third Beast the face of a man and the fourth Beast was a flying eagle now you notice that when you read this word it you know it kind of gets gets lost in confusion because people would look and say well these were beasts and and you know those that that Ezekiel Saw they were living creatures but I'm just going to read this to you out of the Greek the word beast in Revelations 4 comes from the Greek word zon is z n and this word zon means a living creature in other words it's something that's alive so it's the very same word that Ezekiel used one was written in Hebrew one was written in Greek but Zan it meant a living creature it's unlike the beast in Revelation 13 remember these were Savage beasts that that word was a different word that was the word Theon which meant they were Savage they were they were venomous beasts they were great they were great Savage Beast SS in Revelations 13 and 11 and different places in the scripture you'll find these are Savage beasts but but Before the Throne of God it wasn't that kind of a beast what John saw he said here were living creatures that were standing Before the Throne of God I I think it's something but notice you say well it was the angels of God but that ain't that ain't what John said Revelations 5:11 he said I heard the voice of many angels around the throne and the Beast and the elders so here he would show us that that they wasn't the Angels it was angels and the living creatures and the elders but mam said see so think about it he said they weren't weren't angels and they weren't Elders they were living creatures at the throne he said well if they were living creatures s what what were they if they weren't angels and they weren't redeemed men what are they he said here's here's what they are I believe that they are the God's guards to his throne so watch the same thing that Ezekiel had spoke of that would that would guard that or that Moses was told that would guard the the the the mercy seat and the would guard The Arc of the testimony it's the same thing that that would that God would place before the garden of it was the guard that would keep the way of a tree of life and the same thing Before the Throne of God here's the guards that would keep the Throne of God he say see now notice he said these same things also were anointings that came through the ages and every time you think about these great guards this morning every time a religious power or something has raised up God has had God has raised something up to be able to combat the spirit that is in that age I mean how many believes that whenever there's a spirit in an age do you think that God don't have something that he would raise up in that age to come comat the spirit that we're fighting to see so you look back in the first age in that that great Roman power that raised to destroy the church but notice what God used in that age the first thing he used the lion anointing it was the anointing of the lion to combat that spirit so in the age of the lion what was it it was Apostle Paul being a man of God an angel to the church a messenger of God and and and as he would come and that great Roman Empire would try to to to to wipe away the people of God but here Paul under that Lon anointing would be able to preach the word of God he said because that was the spirit in the land at that time and what was he it was a line of the tribe of Judah what did he type the line of the tribe of Judah Judah that great warrior which was Christ the word and Paul being Anointed with the word of God you realize in that age that Paul went and spoke it it was under the anointing of a lion but then watch the next age the bible say that when it came down here the ox or the spirit of the ox went forth notice as as the Bible would go into this uh leading Into the Dark Ages and after the Bible was written you remember how the church had went into these great ages of of sacrifice and say see notice how in this time they were sacrificed they would give their lives it was it was a time in the Dark Ages it was a time of work and labor and sacrifice to give their lives you see that it was the anointing of the ox that was upon the church so that's what the church did under the anointing of the ox it was Labor and work and sacrifice that that was the only thing they knew because they were living under that hour it was the sacrif hour that that the ox went but then it came to the next age it came the age of the reformers this is when the church begin to rise and people they they they got Bolder say what caused them to get Bolder it was because the anointing had changed it went from the age of the ox into the age of men and that anointing had shifted no it wasn't about the sacrifice and the work and labor it was about standing up as men and saying the theology wasn't right and and and and the just shall live by faith and and in the time of reformation how many knows what the Reformation was if you if you study about it it was about Great Men of God that would Point people back to God and here under that a under the the age of man they came when they were calling people out into the into the Lutheran age and Wesley age all this it came under the spirit of the man so see so these reformers they come all the way down to the P Pentecostal age from justification down to sanctification all the way what was it it was the man anointing following after the ways of man but notice how showing how it was the age of man is that every time they started a movement it went right into denominationalism do you realize that every reformer every reformer message any great reformer that you read about there's a denomination that followed his ministry see because it was a it was the it was the uh the spirit of a man so so we come each time that creating an organization but but then when we come to the last age it's a different kind of anointing see in the last stage it was an eagle anointing how many how many knows what Brother David preached the message on the other day an eagle has great vision an eagle flies to higher Heights All Through the Bible prophets are typed as Eagles so here all through the scriptures we're looking for this final age we're looking for the age of the eagle and you friends let me tell you this I read a lot of Bible and you I read a lot of theologians and Scholars I spend a lot of time studying and and and and you know I I I I've never found a scholar one I've never found a any of the great religious Scholars that don't believe that we're living in a prophetic age that's something almost every one of them have in common that this is an age of fulfillment of Prophecy or this is the age a prophetic age this isn't something that is denounced by by any any man that reads the Bible we realize that this is a prophetic age so here the prophet would say here it's an eagle age this is where we are he said see but this last message when it would go forth it would come as a flying eagle in the eagle time it's revealed time the word of God made manifest and the word of God proved you said well brother matter if we're living in the eagle age what is the eagle saying here here's the Cry of the eagle can I just tell you this morning make it plain he said let's walk into the baptism of the Holy Spirit come in and believe it with all your heart and let God feel you so what the ministry was in this Eagle age is to call a people back to a true filling of the baptism of the Holy Ghost it wasn't cause them to follow after a man it wasn't to cause them to build up churches and build up all these things between one another and make this big religion and all these things that people do today but it was to call a people back to a Bible Holy Ghost back to the way it was in the book of Acts this was the very purpose I know people got it all twisted up and they make it to be a bunch of things that it ain't and then other people they they come and attack what what they say it is but friends let me tell you the only thing we have to do is to go back to what God said he said there'll come a man or there'll come an anointing in this hour and that anointing it'll lead God's children right back to the Holy Ghost again we're under an eagle anointing why would he lead you back to a holy ghost cuz that's what the church would have need of in order to take a Rapture isn't it something the eagle age Rapture of a church you see the correlation the eagle flies high it's the Rapture of the church you see the age that we're living in to see it's they call us in this age but notice just as these four the anointings guarded when they entered into the ark think about it they were guarding the Ark of the Covenant you realize that the Arc of the Covenant that was the Old Law you said well what what about now we're living under a new Covenant and our New Covenant of the church today is the holy spirit that's the New Covenant that God has given the church that's what that that's where our Salvation is fine see but notice but even the natures the taking the same nature of those of those anointings each one of those were a type of the four gospels that we believe today how many how many see that each one was the Tope of the four gospels see this is where unbelievers miss it when they say they can't believe Jesus I my son all the time I are y are y'all too tired my son all the time he's getting in trouble he acts just like his mama he was he was on he was online the other day talking to he was talking to about a hundred atheist and Muslims and all they have a big group chat and I was like son quit you know what are you doing and he's like well I'm I'm I'm setting them there all having this big discussion and of course one of them that they they started telling they said well we can't believe we can't be a Christian because the Bible isn't right and the go the gospels they contradict each other and you know they kind of put Salem on the spot I was eavesdropping and they put him on the spot and one of the guys he was a a Muslim and he said well read it in your own Bible what is God and Salem said well God is a spirit he said well that's good he said well then go read over here and he gave Salem another scripture Salem turned over in his Bible and he says when Jesus came into the room with the disciples he said now what did Jesus say he said touch me am I not flesh are my feet not flesh I am not a spirit I'm flesh he said see Jesus couldn't be God because he was flesh and God is a spirit and old Josh me and brother Josh Martin was standing there and Josh said Josh kind of whispered something in his ear and Salem said well he said well that's wonderful that that you found that he said but can you tell me one more thing can you turn back a couple of verses and tell me how that flesh man walked through a wall that didn't have a door tell me how that flesh man stood in there with a group of disciples he said why because he was all God and He was all man they didn't want himar him on the chat no more I well go ahead and preach it to them anyhow and let let we we believe that God they they they they don't believe that that that the four gospels there's all kinds of controversy around it well they they differ from one another and one gospel says one thing the other gospel says another but the reason they can't find that is because they don't realize what these four Gospels are but as a Believer you see this that whenever they miss this because the four stories are all different how many ever read Matthew Mark Luke and John they're all four when you read the stories they're all different stories you you read about the the lion you watch what a lion was in The Book of Matthew he talked about the lion of the tribe of Judah and how you know the lion was a king and he he presented Jesus as the king of Israel why because Matthew was under that lion anointing so when he writes about Jesus he writes it under a lion anointing but then you watch how Mark RS when Mark talks about him here comes that great age of ox watch Mark 10:45 he said to serve and to give Life as a ransome for many so he's talking about serving and sacrificing giving life why would Mark write this way because Mark was riding under that Ox anointing since see and now watch when Luke being under under that man or the face of a man or the anointing of man Luke Luke what was Luke's whole book about he said this is the eyewitness testimonies of men this is the I went and got these testimonies from all all the men and I've gathered testimonies and when he wrote about it he wrote about the son of man this and the son of the son of man everything you read about in Luke was about the son of man why because he was riding under the anointing of man or under that man type anointing but then watch about whenever John wrote John was writing under a different anointing John was writing under an eagle anointing so when John wrote about it he wrote it would seem like that John and Matthew didn't have anything in common because the things they write about Jesus seems like they come from two far different Spectrum let let me tell you why it was because Matthew when he would write about Jesus he starts out in the lineage of Abraham and he said he was the natural he talked about his natural birth he said Jesus was the son of David he come the son of Abraham he come from Abraham down down to Isaac and down to Jacob and Matthew goes all the way down the lineage of Abraham until he comes to Joseph he said and Joseph there was a spouse to Mary whom Jesus was born unto so he took the the natural lineage of Abraham but notice whenever John talked about Jesus John didn't write about that he said in the beginning was the word and the Word was with God and the Word was God and the Word was made flesh and it dwelt among us you say why did they write different things because John was riding from an eagle anointing oh my I think about what John it was John that wrote in John the 8th chapter he said your father Abraham rejoiced to see my day and he saw it and was glad and the Jews said to him you're only 50 years old and you've seen Abraham but here's what John writes about Jesus he said but Jesus said before Abraham was I am that wasn't written in Matthew and Mark and Luke It Was Written in the Book of John because John seemed beyond the lineage of Abraham why because he was under an eagle anointing it wasn't it wasn't the anointing of the of the lion it was the anointing of the eagle he seemed Beyond Abraham Matthew couldn't Rite like John because he was under a different kind of anointing notice how here they were all important they all had their place in the gospel you said what were they doing they were guarding one talked like a lion one like an ox one like a like a man the other like an eagle all the four gospels he said what were they sent for they were sent as a protection of the Holy Spirit why because they're God's guards All Through the Bible they're his guards so here they are again they're protecting the Holy Ghost that's what John saw in heaven when he saw these four cherums on the sides of the arcs of the Throne of Heaven they were guards of the arc they were cherubs guarding The Mercy Seat think about they're guarding this place of Mercy can I just read you something this morning said father today we stand in your grace not that it's a special people but it's because just like the day of the lon or the ox or the man it's Eagle time it's the time it's the anointing of the hour it's the time we're living in it's the working of the holy spirit for this time to prove that Jesus is not dead you see the purpose of the message the things that he said he would do just before the evening lights went out here we've been seeing him do that here the picture of the pillar of fire that great Pillar of Fire led the children of Israel the same one that Moses met on the back child of desert the same one that met Paul on the road here he is today the Lord that same Pillar of Fire by evidence and proof of the word even by scientific research revealing the word of the Lord God let the people be awakened this morning Lord let them quickly be awakened that those that have their names on The Book of Life when this flashes across their path may they see just like that little ill Fame woman at the well that day she recognized quickly and she knew it was the scripture and now father I pray that we will receive you in this time in our hearts and it will settle it forever at this hour that they're finished with sin that they will rise and make preparations for a public confession of baptism in the name of Jesus Christ for the remission of their sins to believe that that God has forgiven them and they take on the name of Jesus Christ and then father pour down the Holy Spirit of oil upon them that they might be placed into the service of the Lord God that they might be workers in this last evil day for we realize we have a short time see MAA you think about it our approach to God it has to come a certain way here that God has given us an invitation into the baptism of the Holy Ghost but do you realize in order to be able to access this place of Mercy you had to first get past the guards that's why people can't pull me into all kinds of unbelief because I have a revelation of the of the scripture they can't they can't just take a quote and say well this was missed here because I have enough revelation of the scripture you see it was guarded you can't just take and and and just walk in there why because it was guarded you realize your approach to God has to be a certain way that's why I don't follow after denom denominational churches can I say this without y'all thinking uh uh different of me I went to church at the Pentecost church I went to church at the Baptist Church I went to church at the church of Christ Church I've been to church at the Episcopalian Church I went to church at the Catholic church I've been to church at the Methodist Church I've been to a lot of different churches but you know what I find out is in the church there's no Holiness right in the church they're trying to find The Mercy Seat in the church they're trying to get to the same place trying to gain access to the throne of God but you realize that this Throne of God is being guarded by the gospels they're guarded by these great anointings to see so your approach to God has to come a certain way how many believe that so you can't just go to God and just some any a way that's way that's way the church wases make it can I don't say this to be a mockery but but but they stand outside smoking cigarettes walk in start preaching the gospel and just unclean things are drinking and getting drunk then going to the pool pit and all all this garbage that people call the gospel that everybody bring brings coffee in there's nothing sacred about it any longer but but the gospel never was supposed to be a social club a church ain't supposed to be a a social club it's supposed to be a place where the anointing of God can fall in among his people like it was on the day of Pentecost in the book of Acts it's a place where people can leave the world on the outside and come in and meet with God and allow the anointing of the Holy Ghost to pour out upon them again a place where people could have fellowship with God and just because you went somewhere that that anointing wasn't had or maybe that anointing had fallen away don't mean that God ain't still real it don't mean his word ain't still true just because you've had a bad experience it don't mean that God God's word ain't still true because we're living under the anointing of the hour you say brother man I want to be free this morning we'll get under the anointing of the message of the hour I want to had Deliverance this morning then get under the anointing of the message of the hour it's an eagle anointing it's called it's Church think about it in order to access the Throne of God you have to get past those guards these are Mighty guards you can't just walk in there in your way you can't just come to God any way and say well god'll accept me like this if I'm if I it don't matter what I am if I if I can be a sinner if I want to God god'll just accept me that way but God don't just accept us anyway think about it here at the when you come down to the altar it's to turn from it's to it's to it's to take on Holiness that we might be able to be worthy by the blood of Jesus Christ to stand in the presence of God not to make a mockery of the grace of God to our approach to God it has to be a certain way you remember Aaron the priest how that he went into The Mercy Seat how many remembers only once a year he could even go in but Aaron he went in he had to have the the road built just right the bells ringing on the bottom every step he would remember they say they would ring out holy holy holy unto the Lord but here when when he would go in before him he would have the blood of the sacrifice sprinkling before him why he was going before the mercy seed you say what was he doing he was getting past the guards so here he took the blood of the sacrifice and he put it before him cuz that's the only way he'd ever get past him you you know there was people that went in before there that was struck with Leprosy there was people that lost their lives you tell me it wasn't guarded it's a guarded place in order to get to The Mercy Seat of God it is a guarded place and the only way to have access to the mercy of God is to take the blood of the sacrifice and put it before you so therefore every step that he took he was walking with the blood had already been shed I thought my is't that what we have to do this morning here as we walk Before the Throne of God the only way you'll ever get to God is let the blood of the sacrifice be sprinkled before you oh God I don't know where I I come from Lord I know I've made a lot of mistakes but let the blood of the sacrifice be sprinkle before me let me walk the path of the sacrifice this morning as I make my way to the throne of God and as he would go in this journey here he was anointed with oil remember Aaron's oil you know what it was made out of it was made out of the Rose of Sharon oh my is there something here it was that great Rose of Sharon that that sweet smelling Savor isn't that what Jesus was typed there he was typed as a Rose of Sharon I thought isn't it something but you realize before he could have that anointing see he had to have the blood and he had to have the right anointing but in order to have that anointing that that Rose had to be crushed down it had to be torn apart and the beauty of the Rose had to be tore down though it wasn't beautiful anymore that the anointing that was in the Rose could come upon the man Aaron oh friends don't you realize that's the only way we have access to The Mercy Seat of God I thank God that we've had a sacrifice that's come for us a blood that we can sprinkle before our path as we access the Throne of God and I thank God this morning that we have a Jesus that arose of sharing that was crushed on the cross of Calvary that the anointing would be poured upon the church that's the only way you'll get past the guards they had the right sacrifice and the right anointing and because he had the right sacrifice and the right anointing that he can walk past the guard see we now we're living in this age but said we're living in another age think about it he said I love this age why because God just like it was God has a mercy seat today to be guarded you said well where's that mercy seat at it's in the heart of man when did it come in the heart of man at the day of Pentecost when the Holy Ghost fell it's when it came down into the human heart you say well how did the church get there to Pentecost think about it in the book of Acts how did the church get to this place you know what people say I'm I'm just maybe five more minutes you know what they say the book of Acts is the framework of the church how many heard that the book of Acts is the framework of the church any denomination says that the book of Acts is the framework of the church but notice but the gospels were the framework of the book of Acts see there had to be something that caused the book of Acts to take place to see so here watch where these gospels these four gospels are the framework to back Pentecost after they had the framework up then Pentecost come into existence so here Matthew Mark Luke and John these Great Men of God here they wrote their they preach their gospel and they talk of the Gospel of Jesus Christ each anointing he was laying a foundation of of of that of that of that uh anointing that he was under so what was it doing it was building a frame of a framework that the day of Pentecost could even come into existence it was the framework that built it up so Matthew Mark Luke and John is the framework or they're the guard work that protect that protects the main Temple the throne and they protect the Pentecostal blessing that makes me want to shout all over this building that hear these four gospels that they were the the guards that protect the Pentecostal blessing see so there's only one way to get to it I know the the world makes all kinds of ways to get to this Pentecostal blessing but you won't get there without going through Matthew Mark Luke and John see it's the gospel see the see see what they're directing us they're directing us to be able to have access to that Pentecostal blessing to have access to the to to that book of Acts experience you see so here were these four gospel guards notice what the Bible says they were guards of the mercy seat and see see said we still got guards today we found out that those guards are Matthew Mark Luke and John they're guarding the book of Acts the acts of the Holy Spirit done in the book of the Apostles or the book of Acts in the New Testament and the four writers Matthew Mark Luke and John all guard The Mercy Seat to show that it is God the Holy Spirit today than you each one has taken their position to guard access to this Mercy Seat of God you think of these four beasts four powers the living uh creatures all these they were ringing out in the presence of God I thought my isn't it something if men lived under the power of the lion and then men lived under the power of the ox see he said there were Beast they were Powers men lived under the power of the man then I believe that there's a men a people that will live under the power of the eagle that great omnipotent power of God that that's moved into this church you think about it what we're living under today under the shakana glory of God what was in The Mercy Seat what what was what were they guarding when they were guarding the Ark of the Covenant it was to guard it was guarding the shika Glory it was guarding access into the presence of God so see it's it's being guarded today that that same Shak glory and they went in and they and they would dwell under the interlock wings of those cherubs here's where the prophet of God would go that he would have access to the shika Glory I thought my this is where we are today Church we're not trying we're we're trying to have access to that same Glory that same Shina Glory that's moved in upon this church this morning but you won't find it looking under wings we're not trying we're not looking for it in a box we're looking for it in the word of God we're not looking to to an arc or some old law or going to Jerusalem trying to find some place to find it but we'll find it in the word of God not under the wings of a chable but under the outstretched horns of Jesus Christ that hung up on the cross of Calvary that the the very protector of the glory of God and under those outstretched wings for the West you we have access to The Mercy Seat of God under those outstretched arms we have access to the the kind of Glory of God that this church this morning 2,000 years later can experience the same outpouring of the Holy Ghost that they had on the day of Pentecost friends this ain't a message for a day gone by this ain't a new message for a new people it's the gospel that Jesus preached it's the gospel that Paul preached it's the gospel that the disciples preached and it's the same gospel today it's been guarded and kept into this age till you and I can say I'm a member of the book of Acts I'm a I'm one of them that the that the spirit of God poured out upon in the book of Acts it's been guarded by all these gospels all these guards down through this age until that time of the Great Eagle anointing would take the church into a place that they could receive it my the Bible said and shall they fear the name of the Lord from the West when the enemy shall come in like a flood the spirit of the Lord shall lift up a standard against him think about what God's done in this age see not if the enemy comes but when the enemy comes you remember remember Paul rever when he went out riding and what what what was his message when he wrote he said the enemy's coming the enemy's coming the enemy's coming you said well when will he come I tell you what a prophet said he said I'm an American too and I'm riding this Midnight Hour I'm not saying the enemy's coming but I'm saying he's here he ain't coming he's already here he's conquered many he's he he's conquering and destroying in this Midnight Hour don't you realize that we're living in the age that the enemy has arrived we're in the age where the enemy has arrived he he he he's arrived you say what what's he doing he's against this church he's against you he's against your family he's tormenting homes he's not coming he's here he's trying to destroy your faith just trying to to destroy your home trying to destroy you the love between a husband and a wife you think it just stops with scripture oh no it comes right down in the middle of the home you think what what it'll do it'll introduce the spirit you you oh my friends you take you take a man that would that would walk away from his faith watch you the enemy ain't done with you there when you walk away from your faith he'll introduce do things into your life what he's trying to take you into alcoholism and and trying to take you into having bitterness for for others where you you can't even communicate anymore try to destroy your home because the enemy is here he's on your doorstep he's trying to destroy us he's brought Tor torment to homes and sicknesses that medical science has no cure for the enemies here here he's brought trouble that there's no answer to the enemy's here but what's the Bible say but when the enemy comes in like a flood somebody quote it with me God will raise up a standard you say well what is that standard can I just say what a prophet said he said that standard is the eagle anointing that's what that standard is you said well how does God raise it because he brings Revelation it's that anointing of this age what what was the purpose of the eagle anointing it was the I don't have time to preach this it it was to bring the church to a place of Revelation that they could overcome the devil see somebody can tell you anything about water baptism I you I sat down with a lot of friends that would try to tell you different about water baptism but when you catch a revelation of it in the scripture then then nobody can take it from you that's why I that's why I challenge people to read their Bible you know what happens today most people don't even read their Bible they don't know what this is anymore why they they they oh I get myself in trouble but they just quote most of the the sermons preached today are plagiarized sermons that it's just it's plagiarized off what somebody else said people don't study and read their Bible anymore but I think what people need is they need a Bible Revelation of the Gospel of Jesus Christ and if you ever get a Bible Revelation then the devil can't take it away from you so what we need is a revelation abely that's why you have a a Bible Holy Ghost filled Full Gospel Church that can give you a Bible Revelation where's it at in the Bible I want to know it in the scripture why because God sent a word Prophet to show the word in the Bible and every word of it was in the Bible that's why people couldn't ever take me away from this message they can talk about the man they can talk about what he preached and what he done and this and that what people said you realize that ain't none of that matters to me I want you to take this word and you challenge the doctrine and you take that and show me different from the Revelation that have i that that I've already gained see they don't they want sit down why they're not theologians they're not going to sit down and show you because there's always a scripture that'll that'll contradict what they're saying you realize that's what the devil done he done that to Jesus he took him up on the mountain he said well it is written why he would try Jesus said but it is also written why because he was one with Revelation and that's what this a that's what this message was sent for it was sent to give the church a revelation of the Bible it was sent us to give a revelation that would help us through this hour that when men would bring teachings and false teachings and try to get you in all these churches and things you say but that ain't the revelation of the Bible it was sent to give you a revelation of the Bible think about it you say well what does revelation can do it destroys the enemy see your friends can come by as the music players come friends can come by I don't want to be a liar too many times this morning but they come by and they can say anything they want to you but but see it may bring confusion until you have a revelation see the Revelation takes away the confusion well I already see it in the scripture how many can say this morning I've gained Revelation this morning see that it's something that God gives us here with revelation it removes doubt with Revelation it it overcomes it overcomes unbelief that's what the church really needs you say well they need to listen to this they didn't do what we really need is just revelation we need a real revelation of the word of God and a real Revelation is what'll hold you it's the only thing that'll see you through Revelation is it's it it'll break every barrier that you ever face you realize that you're going to go through things in your life great barriers that you'll have to overcome and your walk with God there's many just starting just baptized our church is full of them we baptize people all the time that's our calling but do you realize in your walk with God some that are young some that are new how many's been serving the lord less than a year go ahead and raise your hand several in the room God bless you how many been serving the lord longer than for five years or less several how many how many 10 years or less how many how many 20 years how many serving 30 40 50 years see we have them from all all sorts I won't say any bigger numbers but we have all all ages some's been serving the lord for 50 years some been serving the lord for a year but you realize that no matter where you are in your walk with God we come to barriers there's things that come up in our life that we can't get through things that are that are raised up and you realize that's the enemy the enemy that comes in like a flood and God said any any time that he comes I will raise a standard but what is he doing he's giv us an anointing in this age to bring a revelation to the church that we' be able to overcome that no matter where we are in our walk not what people do and they make it worshiping men goofy stuff but be but real Christians Holy Ghost filled Believers that don't care to walk around like this where are them there're few far between nowadays people that don't care to walk around carry a Bible one preaching the revelation of the of the scripture but I I believe that's what we ought to be but when you come to these great barriers here God would give you a way to pass through it you realize there was you remember you remember whenever the back in 1947 when the sound barrier was broke for the first time it was an age where people feared of going at that speed the fear of the people was that there was an invisible barrier in the sky that if you ever broke it it would destroy you that you never could go that fast here was an invisible barrier they knew the speed of sound but here's an invisible barrier in the sky so at the time they feared supersonic flly the in in the fear of it was because in flying flying builds up so much pressure now think think about this so here these Pilots would get in and they would go and and Chuck Yer he would go in that that famous X1 plane and they and he would try to they' get faster and faster and the planes would shake so much they they was trying to change the aerodynamics of it and the closer they'd get to the speed of sound the the more the airplane would Shake but they they just keep flying and keep building and keep working while they were trying to get this place even though they didn't know what was going to happen when they broke it here you're talking about a a man that was taking a risk he was the best pilot in the entire United States Air Force at the time but he was willing to risk his own life not knowing what would happen he didn't know if the plane would explode why he said because there was an invisible barrier and people feared it but notice what was happened is because there was such a pressure built up around it you know what I thought about when I thought about that I thought you know as long as you were standing on the ground you had no pressure but where did the pressure come from it the pressure came because he was trying to break through the barrier and the more he flew and the faster he went and the more he tried and the harder he tried to get through the bar the barrier the more pressure that was built up around the plane you realize you if we could experimented this morning but if you took your hand and you do this you feel a wind on your other hand you ever noticed see what that is is because the moving of this hand is creating a pressure out in front of and that's what happens with a plane that's why it would shake and there would build up so much pressure here my here here a plane is in a it actually creates if you can see it by graph it creates a sphere of pressure so here the plane is in the middle of that sphere so as it's pushing and it's displacing air it's pushing air out in front of it which causes a pressure that it has to go through so it's pushing it and then hitting it and pushing it and hitting it and pushing and hitting it so it's a great sphere around the the nose of a plane so it's building up pressure I thought here here here here he is and as he would go and they were afraid of what would happen but notice what happened he said as as a little while as as the plane would get faster and faster notice the pressure gets closer and closer to the plane but as the sphere is still moving with the speed of the plane eventually the nose of that plane it hits the tip of that sphere and when it gets to the tip of that sphere it actually just the very moment it's a micro moment whenever it breaks through that sphere the entire time that sphere of pressure has been around the plane but the very moment that it goes past the speed of sound and goes into supersonic speed that actual sphere disappears and it turns into a cone so when he hits it here this sphere's been going along 200 300 400 500 mph all the way to 700 mph and finally when he hits it now it's no longer a sphere but it actually turns into a cone in other words all of the pressure that was before the plane the plane is going so fast that no pressure is able to go out in front of it but it displaces all pressure that's why you hear a sonic boom whenever a plane goes by at 700 mph because they broke the barrier or the they call it the sound barrier but I can say it like this this morning they broke the pressure barrier so now because all the pressure and all those waves that was hitting back at the plane all those waves are now behind the plane and you realize I I know you say well that Sonic Boom it's not just one blast like a big boom but that Sonic Boom is a continuous sound the only time it's a boom is because you're on the ground and you hear it go by and you hear that big boom but that noise is happening the entire time the plane is in that speed of flight so it's a continuous sound it's a continuous roaring noise that is behind it that make that Sonic Boom it's called It's called The Boom carpet and that carpet is continuously sounding all this sound that is so great that when you go by the United States outlawed flying supersonic flights over land because it was so great that it it would disturb the neighborhoods or even maybe cause damage to some buildings and things like that but you realize that all of this great noise that the only people that can't hear the noise is the people that are on the plane see whenever he passed that barrier all that pressure that he heard and roaring of the noises and all all that that he heard when he broke through the speed of sound now he couldn't hear it because all the sound was behind him thought I make a Believer want to shout see that's what happened in this age Brother David as we passed through this barrier I thought isn't it something this is just me it's free you don't have to take it if you don't want to it's is just mad but isn't it something that the year they broke the speed of sound and broke the sound barrier was 1947 that's the same year they started recording the message on tape I thought that's just a free coincidence but but I thought here here whenever that sound Barry was broken what did it do it allowed the church to break free from all the noises and all the pressure that was built up all that denominationalism that was built up the pressure around the people of God that just wanted to be holy ghost filled believers they just wanted to be Church uh uh they just wanted to be right with God and every one of them wound up in another denomination trying to find The Mercy Seat of God and what it took is it took one a pilot that was able to get into a plane that would take up in a under an eagle anointing and fly in a at a speed that no other man could fly what was he trying to do get to a place where it would displace the pressure off the people of God and it wasn't very long you know what they did it wasn't just Chucky jager's fly but they made commercial planes where other people could get on board glory to God wasn't just a pilot but they made him commercial I heard this the other day that they're actually trying to bring those back transatlantic flight in just a few hours it make a trip to London a day trip they're trying to bring them back but is it something but here they made commercial flights that would fly supersonic speed I believe that's what's happened in the church today here the pilot has gone on that that under that great Eagle anointing that would break through and show the church the access to the Holy Ghost it was it was the access that here here's the true word of God here's the here's the Holy Ghost it wasn't to start a a belief or start some thing where people get all this stuff that people do it was to show you that there was a real access to the throne of God he showed the way to get past the guards and to be able to receive the very Promises of God in this hour he said we're but them out what I got to do to receive them can I just say it get on board how do I receive the Holy Ghost get on board how do I receive the promises of God get on board how do I get past this sphar of pressure that's on my life get on board won you stand to your feet this morning I love what he said Chuck Jager he said there was a barrier he said but the real barrier it wasn't in the sky they thought there was a barrier you'd had to break he said the real barrier wasn't even in the sky he said the real barrier was in our knowledge and experience of SuperSonic flight the real barrier was in our own thoughts isn't that where it is today where's the real barrier it's in our own thinking that we can't break through to a move of God can't break through to a supernatural move of God but friends let me tell you I believe we've had a sonic boom today I believe the church is moving at an all-time high I believe that we're I believe that we are that we're we're a church that's living under an eagle anointing that's broke through the the barrier of denominationalism and broke through the barrier of fear and broke through the barrier of unbelief and through the barrier of the Unseen we broke broke through the barrier to live again do you believe that I wonder how many say brother man that's my prayer I want to break through the barrier say how do I do it get on board on board with what with the baptism of the Holy Ghost on board with an eagle anointing that would take the church to a higher Heights don't let it be what what men say it is and they can paint you any picture do you realize I know I'm done preaching I've done lie to y'all me y'all may as well fire me do you realize how easy it is to deceive people you think about what the world does the media all they have to do is change the definition of something and then say then they make up a word and now everybody falls under that definition so if I if I say it this morning say all all blondes or are to be a cult it means to be blond-headed that's what a cult means be blond-headed so then you could look around and say well she's in one she's in one she's in one she's in one he's in one why because they were blond-headed he said well how'd you do that change the definition of what a cult was so as long I make the definition fit my narrative well then I can turn around and apply everybody to it because it fits my narrative my definition why do you think they redefine things all the time it's what the media does re redefine things that where can fit you in it but I'm not going to let them redefine me you you can call it what you want you can you can make up a definition you can call but but I'm not going to let them redefine me I know what I am I'm a fundamental Full Gospel Bible Church that believes the Gospel of Jesus Christ the message of apostle Paul and I believe God in this hour has seen an eagle anointing to to call the church back to that very thing I don't think it was a new message I believe it was the same message that Paul preached and that's what the church ought to be today not to lift up a man or to lift up a people but to lift up Jesus Christ above why because he's the ego standard for the Church of the Living God that's what I believe this morning do you believe that this morning amen let's just bow our heads gracious Heavenly Father Lord we thank you Lord for your word this morning God I pray I pray you'd forgive me Lord I didn't mean to go so long and Lord I pray you'd help me Lord this morning God I pray Lord that you would help our church Lord let us grow closer unto you God let us be so anointed by Your Word Lord I pray you would help those and God that's trying to break through God may this be an hour a great breakthrough for them Lord that to break past these barriers of unbelief and Lord the pressures that's upon us in this flesh God that we could be free with men and women of the Gospel Lord we thank you for your word this morning and God may you give us Grace to be able to receive it in Jesus name we pray [Music] amen amen you love the Lord this morning want somebody give the Lord a hand clap of Praise holding my shield of Faith cuz I feel no alarm when the enemy come in like the blood I will raise up the [Music] standard my face out the down
