[40:01] which is upon the seashore and thy seed
[40:04] shall possess the gates of his enemies
[40:09] praise the Lord also Hebrews is the
[40:12] sixth
[40:17] chapter let's start at verse
[40:25] 13 says for when God God made a promise
[40:28] to Abraham because he could swear by no
[40:31] greater he swore by himself saying
[40:34] surely blessing I Will Bless thee and
[40:36] multiplying I'll multiply thee and so
[40:39] after he heard patiently endured he
[40:41] obtained the promise for men verely
[40:43] swerve by the greater and oath for
[40:46] confirmation is to them an end of all
[40:49] Strife wherein God willing more
[40:51] abundantly show unto The Heirs of his
[40:54] promise the immutability of his counsel
[40:57] and he confirmed it by an oath that by
[41:00] two immutable things it is
[41:03] impossible or by by two immutable things
[41:07] is possible God to lie which may have
[41:10] strong consolation who may flee to

[46:13] you from the promises of
[46:16] God
[46:19] oh he's came too late brother
[46:23] Mark Hallelujah i' like to take a
[46:25] thought tonight amen I have given you
[46:29] the land brother Brown says there was
[46:32] Moses Abraham's seed and when he did he
[46:37] said he came to the gate in the line of
[46:41] duty he came to the gate of the Red Sea
[46:45] right in the line of duty he came up
[46:48] against something that he know not what
[46:52] to
[46:53] do Amen brother 10 we can all say Amen
[46:57] to that tonight amen the prophet of God
[47:00] came to a place he did not know what to
[47:03] do he said that was the Red Sea well he
[47:07] said what happened the Seed of
[47:10] Abraham was promised to possess the
[47:15] enemy's
[47:17] Gates so when the Red Sea listen to this
[47:20] phrase see he said when the Red Sea
[47:23] become a gate in other words something
[47:27] between Moses and the promise it became
[47:31] a gate that he couldn't come through but
[47:35] God moved upon the scene and took the
[47:40] gate and went away with it and Moses
[47:43] walked across the sea on dry ground
[47:47] Moses didn't move the gate God
[47:51] did hallelujah amen when we come to
[47:54] those Gates it isn't you and I that's
[47:57] moving the gate it's us coming to the
[48:00] gate and not knowing amen how we're
[48:03] going to overcome and or get across
[48:08] it but if it becomes a gate to
[48:12] you God is interested in that
[48:15] gate amen let me tell you something God
[48:19] is interested in you
[48:22] tonight Brother David the world may not
[48:25] care about Brother David amen you they
[48:28] might ridicule you talk about you
[48:30] standardize your name I'm talking to
[48:33] every individual here today it doesn't
[48:35] matter what people think about me or you
[48:38] it's what Papa God believes in us and
[48:41] I'm telling you he's got confidence in
[48:44] you
[48:47] why because he already seen you he
[48:51] already seen you before there was a star
[48:54] brother amamos before there was an earth
[48:56] before there was a a an enemy he already
[49:00] seen you brother Amos overcoming in such
[49:04] a time as this we frit we get excited we
[49:08] get hard feelings we get our we get
[49:10] things tumbled in our Spirits we all do
[49:13] the prophet of God done the same thing
[49:16] he would tell us of instances amen that
[49:18] he got himself all worked up but at the
[49:21] end of the day amen the anchor still
[49:25] held it's sure and
[49:28] steadfast
[49:30] Hallelujah God moved upon the scene and
[49:34] tued that gate and went away with it and
[49:37] Moses walked across on dry ground his
[49:41] seed possessed the gate Hebrew children
[49:45] possessed the gates of the fiery furnace
[49:47] but can have just a little bit on the
[49:49] monitors possess the gates he said the
[49:52] gates of the fire furn that could not
[49:54] even burn them

[50:00] the lion's mouth that could not open to
[50:02] eat him Samson one time bunch of people
[50:06] had fixed him in the city when he did he
[50:09] pulled those great big Gates out out of
[50:11] the rocks and put them upon his
[50:13] shoulders and walked up to the top of
[50:15] the hill he said why was he he was still

[51:10] to possess the gates because they was
[51:12] promised it brother Matt he said but he
[51:15] said but when it came to death they all
[51:17] had to
[51:18] die now here comes the Royal seed not
[51:22] only did he possess the gates of his
[51:24] enemy but possess the gates of death
[51:27] hell and the grave and he rose up on the
[51:30] third day and he opened up the way he
[51:33] ripped the veil from top to bottom to
[51:37] declare this has nothing to do with man
[51:40] this is God's doing he ripped it from
[51:42] the heavens down to the Earth to let us

[2:10:17] [Music]
[2:10:21] our answer lies in the word of God that
[2:10:24] that's our inheritance so when we come
[2:10:27] to a place we look for the answer when
[2:10:29] we don't know what to do or where to
[2:10:31] turn we only go to the word and we
[2:10:33] always find our answer in the word of
[2:10:35] God when you don't know what to say you
[2:10:36] don't know how to handle it or how to
[2:10:38] deal with it you find your answer in the
[2:10:40] word of God how many believes that so we
[2:10:42] go through the scripture and we find
[2:10:44] this to be the case the Bible said Heath
[2:10:46] said I will never leave thee nor forsake
[2:10:48] thee so that we may boldly say that the
[2:10:51] Lord is my helper and I will not fear
[2:10:54] how many say that no matter what any man
[2:10:57] shall do unto me I will not fear it our
[2:10:59] answer lies in the word of God you know
[2:11:02] where fear comes from it comes from the
[2:11:03] devil anxiety it comes from the devil
[2:11:06] but our answer lies in the word of God I
[2:11:08] believe he's given us a way out when
[2:11:10] you're lonely you can find comfort in
[2:11:13] Psalms 23 when you're troubled you'll
[2:11:16] find an answer in second Corinthians
[2:11:18] brother Mark whenever you're afraid
[2:11:20] you'll find courage in Ephesians 6 when
[2:11:23] you're lost you can go to John 14 and
[2:11:25] find
[2:11:26] Salvation whenever you have a decision
[2:11:29] to make James 1 tells us how to find
[2:11:32] guidance when you're in turmoil Isaiah
[2:11:35] 26 shows us where peace lays in the time
[2:11:39] of danger our protections lays in Psalms
[2:11:42] 91 when we're suffering Hebrews 12 said
[2:11:45] we'll find relief Hallelujah when you're
[2:11:48] weary Matthew 11 says you'll find rest
[2:11:51] in the middle of Temptation James 1 and
[2:11:53] 12 12 said there's
[2:11:55] strength when you get complacent and
[2:11:57] you're indifferent you don't feel like
[2:12:00] going on said even Galatians that say
[2:12:02] but there's a warning a calling to the
[2:12:05] church to put us on our toes and CS us
[2:12:07] to be able to stand fast I believe
[2:12:10] that's what we've heard tonight is a
[2:12:11] call to Stand Fast upon the word of God
[2:12:14] no matter what you're battling our
[2:12:16] answer lies within the
[2:12:18] word amen
