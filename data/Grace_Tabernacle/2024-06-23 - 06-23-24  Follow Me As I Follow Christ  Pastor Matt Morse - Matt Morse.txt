scripture to the book of First Corinthians in the 11th chapter and we'll read out of the first verse amen just thank the Lord for all he's been doing for us and youall remember brother Andrew Glover he asks for prayer from the church they over in Australia and him and and brother cross that had gone with him so just pray the Lord be with them I just enjoy how many enjoyed the service Wednesday night amen just appreciate our brother coming and just surrendering to God and allowing the gift of evangelism to operate in the body of Christ amen you still believe in the five-fold ministry amen I just love it this morning we're going to read out of the book of uh 1 Corinthians 11th chapter in the first verse Bible said this is Apostle Paul he said be you followers of me even as I also am of Christ and from that this morning I'd like to take this text follow me as I follow Christ and you can take your seats follow me as I follow Christ I we spoke uh last Sunday and we were speaking on the church needing uh a a leading or or the the nature of a True Believer and and how that the nature of a Believer uh would be would be one that would that would have one to follow remember the nature of a Believer would be that of a sheep and and the prophet of God say you know it was a strange thing that God would chose to represent a son on the earth a a creature called a lamb and and how that many times you say wonder why that he was called a lamb but God chose a lamb because a lamb was the meekest of all of the creatures upon the Earth and so of all the animals that God could use to type uh this this uh Christ he said there was nothing more Meek than a lamb but a little lamb had the right kind of nature it was the one that was a surrendered nature he would be able to fulfill uh the prophets and what Isaiah would say he said as a lamb that was done before his shears he open not his mouth and and you know brother B said why couldn't we have those kind of meetings that we used to have he said the way to have meetings like that is to just become sheep and the way I I believe that this morning I I I really believe that that's the purpose of the church is to be able to become she come sheep and and to allow God to be able to lead us and that's why that's why we come and have Wednesday night services like we had Wednesday night is because we have a church filled with the Sheep of God that are that are willing to follow the word of God and I know that whenever when sheep call to God guess what God does he always answers he hears the cry remember the the story that Jesus told about the shepherd when he left the 99 but he went after the one what was it that caused him to go it was a lost sheep or one that uh maybe just a little cry of a little lost lamb and it was enough to get the attention of the Creator God that he would that he would that he would leave the the fold and he would go out and and find that one that was lost and be able to bring them back in and and you know I think it's wonderful to be able to preach the Sheep it's easy they're they don't fight against you they're not criticizing the word they're not attacking what's being preached or what's being said but but the Sheep of God they hear the word of God they'll take it brother the mark even if sometimes it steps on their toes they say Amen anyway there're just something about sheep they they they just have one word it's so be it it's Amen it's it's Lord be it unto me it doesn't matter if it if it feels good they'll say Amen if it feels bad they'll say Amen if it hurts them they'll say Amen if it steps on their toes they'll say Amen because they're the sheep of the word of God and I believe that the Sheep they are made sheep are made to follow they're made to follow after if you ever had a a herd of sheep there's something about sheep you can't get behind them and you can't drive them you you know you can get behind cattle and you can drive cattle and that's how you'd move them across the pasture but when it comes to sheep sheep don't move the same way that cattle move and so in order to move sheep all it takes is a Good Shepherd that would go in front of him the Shepherd that would feed him out of his hand and that Shepherd as he would walk across then the Sheep would would just follow after the shepherd I mean isn't it something that there's some kind of animals that can't be driven that can't be pushed you can't you can't force them into it but but sheep have to be led and so God has called us to this I remember I remember uh he called us to to to be this way I remember when I went over to India and and you remember me telling the story but how the it just fascinated me to be in this city of millions of people be uh gathered around but here these little Shepherds would have their little flock of sheep and they're just looking for a patch of grass here and there to feed them but you go through the hustle and bustle of this great cities and and the horns honking and the chaos in the streets and the people screaming and the vendors on the side of the road and and trying to sell things but the Sheep followed after the shepherd I thought isn't it something there's one Shepherd going this way and another Shepherd going this way and they'll have their little flock following they'll have their little flock following and and I you know my little country boy couldn't help himself and I holled out the sheep hey sheep sheep hey sheep trying to get their they don't look up brother martin they don't pay no attention to you they don't care what's going on around they don't care what's going on in the rest of the city or the rest of the world but they eyes is on one thing it's on the shepherd and and might he just put the staff on the ground and he took another step and they would just follow after him I I thought that's the way it is with the Church of the Living God they're made to follow after Jesus Christ you realize friends that that God's church has always been a church that was led how many believes that say Amen you go all the way back to the book of or the the Book of Genesis when the in the days of Noah whenever God would destroy the Earth what did God do to bring the children of God out of a world that would be judged he sent a man by the name of Noah to lead them out of that condition he built an ark he preached the mercy of God and the grace of God and the Bible says and those people that would follow after the voice of Noah they were spared from judgment their lives were spared their families were spared because they followed after the voice that God sent to the age that they were living in in the days of Moses here the children of Israel or that were caught up in Egypt and brother Mar but whenever God saw that it was time for them to come out of that place he didn't just make up some mighty thing or some miracle to make them come out of there but God sent a man into into into Egypt and the the man was anointed of God with a message for the day and when he went into Egypt he began to call to the children of Israel he see he performed signs and wonders and brother Mah the people turned around they stopped following after Egypt they F they stopped following after the Taskmaster and they turned to Moses and they followed Moses right out of Egypt Into the Wilderness into a land that it looked like there was no food there was no water but but it didn't matter they were following after the leader that God had sent to lead the church I thought this is the way God has always done he's always LED his church somebody say amen God has always LED his church and and when the church got into their own place and they got into into this land of promise and the people wanted a a king to be able to be uh put over them but God allowed him a king but still yeah they were following the leadership of the king that great Saul that was raised up after a few days and and it got into trouble it looked like it would fall away but God wasn't going to let it fall away he raised up a little Shepherd out in the field I thought my isn't it wonderful that it was a Shepherd that God raised up when they got in trouble it was a man that was raised in a Sheepfold it was man that was raised on the on the backside of a Wilderness that had practice in leading God's sheep and God set him over the people of Israel to be the leader over his sheep and and and he led them and and all the way through the Bible we see this same thing they went from being led by David they were led by the prophets of God and these great these great prophets that God had called in the Old Testament they LED God's children all the way down to the greatest of prophets the Bible would say was a man by the name of John the Baptist and and when John the Baptist came what did he do brother Wesley but he led them down to the river Jordan and he baptized them and and and he introduced them to Jesus Christ I thought my isn't it wonderful that God's children have always been LED he led them from John the Baptist brother Mark and then and then came the next Prophet his name was Jesus after John the Baptist and Jesus was the greatest prophet of all there was no man that walked upon the Earth like Jesus Christ but what was he here for to be a Shepherd over the Sheep of God over the flock of God and he led them and the Bible said that when he laid down his life and he he was crucified and he resurrected on the third day and he ascended into heaven and then he sent his Spirit back upon the Earth and then that great holy ghost that came to the Earth became the lead of the children of God and let me tell you friends how many believe that the same spirit that was in Jesus Christ is the same spirit that came back in the Holy Ghost it was the same God that means if the works that Jesus done is the same works that the Holy Ghost done that means the same Prophet that he was when he was here on the earth is the same gift of Prophecy that came back upon the church on the day of Pentecost it was sent to lead the church out of the condition that they were in God has always LED his church somebody say Amen listen what Paul said in Romans 8 14 he said for many as are led by the spirit of God they are the sons of God how many believe that for many as are led by the spirit of God they are the sons of God now I know many many people have misused this scripture down Through the Ages but but we realize the intention of what Paul is saying is to identify that the sons of God are those that are led by the spirit of God how many see that in that scripture and in other words if you would take two groups and and you would look at one group and and that group was led by the spirit of God and they were following after God's spirit well then you could identify them well they must be the children of God because God is leading them you look at the other group and they're not being led by God well they must not be the children of God because God isn't leading them so Paul gives us this as an identifier as who are the sons of God he said the ones that are being L by the spirit of God they are the sons of God and you know so you see that many has taken this today and they they they they've misused it and they've made they made this uh to be a constant they'll say well they I'm a Son of God so they made I'm a Son of God to be a given or a constant can I can I I'm I'm a I'm a math I'm a math uh a math uh student so so I love to look at things in that way and so when you see this scripture brother brother Tim when you see this scripture that that Paul spoke you you you see there's a formula that goes with it Paul says as many as are led by the spirit of God they are the sons of God so if you looked at this in a math in a mathematical perspective maybe you put this formula on it you'd say the people plus the leading of the spirit equals the sons of God how many see there so you take the people and then you take the leading of the spirit and add it to the people then that equals the sons of God so that's the formula that Paul was trying to bring to the church but what men have done is they've taken that formula and changed the formula and they and they do all sorts of things and so they'll they they'll make anything right and say well I I can do this well why you do that because the sons of God are led by the spirit of God and I think you ought to do this and I think you ought to go this way and I think you ought to change this and I think the church ought to be this way and well how can you say say that brother because the sons of God are led by the spirit of God you see what they've done is they've taken this I'm a Son of God and made it a constant so now the formula has changed and now the formula says like this I'm a Son of God plus my actions or my beliefs which is the leading of the spirit equals the equ or my actions or beliefs equals the leading of the spirit so because I'm a Son of God no matter what I do or no matter what I say it was the leading of the spirit you see how men have Twisted it so it doesn't matter how we it doesn't matter how we acted that that way a man can come and he can lead over the church he can control you he can control how you live he can control how you how you uh talk to one another he can control every part of your life that's the spirit of the Nick and then would come in this age it would say well I'm the Son of God and because I'm the Son of God then whatever I say is the leading of the spirit but that ain't what Paul said he said but sons of God are led by the spirit of God in other words it's only a way to identify so so in reality just because you say something don't mean it's the leading of the Spirit or because because because if it's the leading of the spirit it has to be the word of God see that's the reality if it doesn't line up with the word of God that it wasn't the leading of God at all so it doesn't matter how big of a son that you I'm going to get in trouble these brothers told me I could preach it doesn't matter how big of a son that you think you are when you preach something that or you would speak something that wasn't the word of God it ain't the spirit of God that's leading you if you're if you're telling somebody and you're I know and and I'm not talking about from the pull pit but people get outside and they get in homes and they get at kitchen tables and they pick up cell phones and they begin to minister to one another but friends let me tell you if there's a spirit that's leading you to something that's outside of the word of God it ain't the spirit of God that's leading you say Well they're sons of God they may be but they may be led astray for the spirit of God will lead you to the word of God this is what Peter said he says seeing that you have purified your souls in obeying the word through the spirit so the spirit of God would cause you to be obedient to the word of God it'll only lead you to the word I I know how is today well we got a new spirit that that that's bringing me to a new word there there I know I know the uh everybody's got some new ideas or things about the word of God and and you know there's a new spirit in the land and it's bringing it's bringing some real Clarity to the word of God but listen what Peter said he said but the word of the Lord you can take that down he said but the word of the Lord endureth forever and this is the word which by the gospel is preached un you so Peter says the word of the Lord that's already preached it's not going to change it'll endure Forever This is the same word that's already been preached so any spirit that would come today brother Mark to preach another gospel than that gospel which has already been preached it couldn't be the spirit of Christ it would have to be the leading of the Antichrist Spirit you see the spirit of Christ let me can I tell you something about the spirit of Christ the spirit of Christ will never rebuke a single word of God that means you could take a scripture and you could read the scripture and the spirit of Christ will accept the scripture that you read say well I may not understand it I may not be able able to see how to put that together but it'll accept the scripture that's read the spirit of Christ it'll never rebuke scripture it'll never rebuke the word of God you can when you quote it you know what it'll do brother Wesley it'll say Amen when it steps on their toes they'll say Amen when it when it when it don't fit the way that that that my daddy taught it to me you'll say Amen why because it's the word of God and the spirit of God will never rebuke the word of God but see this word in order for it to be effective in the church it has to be it has to be mixed correctly see the see there's so many that has taken the word of God and they'll use they you take a portion of scripture you can kill anybody with it you notice you can take your a little you can take your little verse and you can just whack people over the head with it and take another verse and beat on this person a little while and take another verse and beat on this person a little while but see because the scripture are not mixed correctly it'll only kill the Bible said that the letter kill it but the spirit giveth life so there has to be there has to be a right kind of mix in the word of God or in the Church of the Living God in order for for the word to be effective or the spirit to be effective among the Believers see so instead of killing with it you you you know you you'll never be able to understand uh uh uh truth with with without the spirit of God and you know there's some things that just never mix you can take oil and water it'll never mix you can take education and the word of God it'll never mix but then there are some things that will mix and the Bible says the greatest mix that there is brother Travis when it comes to the word of God is the spirit and the word of God so when you get the right mix of the spirit of God and and you mix it with the word of God and then it'll lead you to the right thing it'll cause you to turn the page to another scripture and say but it is also written and it is also written and the word will be able to blend together why because it's the right Spirit and the right word mixed together and when you get that kind of a mix in the Church of the Living God the Right Mix will clean the church the Right Mix it'll sanctify the house of God the Right Mix it'll clean your home out and it won't be a bunch of legalism but but it'll clean every lifee it'll bring power to your life the right of the word and the spirit it'll bring Deliverance to you it'll bring the supernatural in the house of God When the Right Mix of the spirit and the word see but to follow the word it comes with a price remember the Rich Young Ruler when he came to Jesus what did he ask him he said what must I do to have eternal life so what must I do to to have and Jesus said you you got to keep the Commandments he began to speak of The Commandments and the man said well all of these things I have kept from my youth and Jesus said unto him well if you'd be perfect go sell all that you have and give it to the poor and you shall have a treasure in heaven and come and follow me I love this it comes with a cost come and follow me here I thought it it wasn't it a privilege that this man he had an interview with Jesus he had a moment to spend time with him and he would offer him such a thing as as eternal life and the Bible said but the man young man heard the saying he went away sorrowful for he had great possessions I thought here what it was he here this man he could have been a disciple like Peter or James or John or could have been a great disciple but said see here was a kid that had been trained or brought upright he had he he had been presented to Christ and to use and Christ could have used him and all the potential that he had here was a rich here was a rich young man no no doubt being a rich man he was educated and influential and and and Wealthy but he could have he could have used all of that and presented the gospel but yet he turned it down what a thing for a young boy when Jesus would say follow me he said see he had to follow someone but he was willing to follow somebody else rather than to follow Christ friends that's the same thing that we deal with today as young people you have an opportunity to either follow the influence of your friends or to follow Jesus Christ you can follow you can follow other people you he was associated with that maybe could have followed the influence of some young lady or the influence of some gang of boys that he was associated with his colleagues in school or he could follow Jesus Christ and all of his goodness yet he knew he didn't have eternal life see in order to follow Christ here Jesus Jesus immediately laid this down that in order to follow me it'll take a sacrifice in order to follow me there's going to be a price to pay in other words say what was the price to pay the price was to give up your old life the PRI price was to give up that old the old way of thinking and to become a part of the move of God brother Mark I I think God has given us a way to be able to lay down something to be able to pick something else up I I know I know if you if you ever study economics there's What's called the cost benefit analysis and what and what that means is that you would weigh the cost versus the potential reward I know we do that every day whether even well most of us do that every day our parents we want our kids to do it son you should weigh the cost or before you before you before you do something you know weigh the cost and the reward before you before you do it it it might not be a good idea but that's that's something that we that we that we subconsciously do brother Mark we what what's it going to cost me to do it and what is the what is the value or what is the reward and so here here whenever Jesus gives the cost and he says to lay it down but but notice that he didn't just give the price but he also told him what the reward would be I thought this is so good because the gospel has a price but it certainly has a reward I think sometimes the cost is what's preached so much that the reward is forgotten and what happens is when you only preach the cost and you only preach the sacrifice that has to be made and you never preach the reward then before long then then going to church becomes legalism because well this is what you have to do to be a Christian and this is what you have to do to serve God and this is what you have to do to to make it to heaven and this is what you have to do to be right and this is what you have to do to get a phone call from me and this is what you have to do to be recognized in the church and this is what you have to do to be a somebody in the house of God and this is what you have to do to have a position in God's church but friends the whole church becomes a bunch of legalism I think Satan Does It Better hello somebody I think Satan does a better job of presenting the reward over the cost because that's all satan does it shows you the reward of of being a sinner he shows you oh what a what a glorious thing that it is brother Ben was preaching on it last Sunday of what a glorious thing that it is that the benefit that that that there is to serving God versus the benefit to serving the devil I thought see what the devil does is he'll make you he'll make it look so good you go get you a bottle of alcohol and take your wife and hang out hang out with your old drinking buddies and mine It'll be such a good time and get on the radio and crank up some good country music and just sit back and and maybe sit in that atmosphere oh what a fun time it'll be but what he don't show you is on the other side is your wife with your drinking buddy or you lost up with some other woman shacked up somewhere and you've lost your family and you're wrecked up and your and your children ain't got a daddy to come home to they ain't got a mama to come home to in the middle of the night you have to come home from work and wonder where your wife is see Satan don't put it in the brochure but I think we ought to tell people the way it is and the way of sin is death it's a wrecked up life it'll never bring anything good to your life or to your home it'll only bring destruction I think that people if you was raised up in so much stuff you'd think the way we was raised would cause us to turn to Jesus Christ the things that we've seen ought to cause you why you've seen the brochure he can't hide it from you you've seen the brochure that Satan hands out but see he presents his his gospel one way but see but see you realize he builds up this great Kingdom he makes it look so much fun it's growing great in number but I've got news for you the kingdom of Satan is coming down everything he's built up it'll never lead to nothing but destruction I'm going to preach a minute whether you let me or not everything he's built up it'll come to it'll come Den not anything Satan builds up in your life it'll never last it'll never stand the test of time it'll never stand the Judgment of God for what he's built it is determined to fall I'm not undermining sacrifice I realize it takes a sacrifice in fact I I'm saying the opposite to you I believe that God demands a total sacrifice I'm not saying Don't Preach what God what God wants from you because God wants you to be willing to give your all he wants you to to be willing to be able to say God if you need my car here's my car if you need my house here's my house if you need my my money here's my money if you need my life here's my life God wants you to be willing to give your all friends let me tell you a secret if you're willing to give God all that you have then God will always make sure you have more than you need that's the kind of God that we serve are we willing to give to God are we willing to sacrifice our life unto him he wants all of it oh let me tell you what Paul said he said who you yield to is whose servant you are he made it plain to let you know that it don't matter what you're doing you're serving somebody said well I'm going to keep no you're not keeping nothing everything you have you're using for one or the other you're either using it for God or you used it for the devil nothing's just being used for yourself he said who you yield yourself to is whose servant you are whether it be of sin unto death or obedience under righteousness but Paul said but thank God that you were I love this word were thank God that you were the Servants of sin see the word he used was were and not are thank God that you were the Servants of sin but then you obeyed from your heart that form of Doctrine which was delivered unto you being made free from sin you became the Servants of righteousness for as you have yielded your members servants to uncleanliness and iniquity brought iniquity but now even so yield your members as servants to righteousness unto holiness see who Ser who you yield yourself to is whose servant that you are see there's a cost there's a sacrifice to serving God but there's also a reward you say well that reward is it eternal life let me tell you something about it can I just can I just just be free let me tell you something about eternal life do you realize that eternal life is not something that you earn it's not something that you've ever done there's nothing you've ever done in your life to be able to earn it it's not something you there's no works you could do the Bible said like this Paul said for by Grace you have been saved through faith not of yourselves it is a gift of God not as a result of your work so that no man May boast it is a gift of God it ain't nothing you've done to ever earn it this eternal life it's not a reward for your works it's not a reward for how good of a church member you are it's not a reward for all the things that you do for God that's not the reward eternal life is a free gift that's why the Jewish people they look down on the Christians and or this uh the Christianity or the modern Christianity and and the gentile people and they call them a bunch of dogs because they say they don't ever do anything to earn their salvation they've never done anything to Merit it and they they had this old friends if you look at this what's called Christianity Today I see what they feel like it's a lazy lifestyle of being called a Christian you can slop around any old way and call yourself a Christian do nothing for the Lord and expect God just to open the windows of Heaven to us and that's what they see when they look at it from the outside but friends but Believers that are acceptable to God no matter what they do or how they act they serve god without evidence this is what they see they're they don't have a life to be able to be able to to to be able to have the things of God but you see how this has been so misunderstood because our works don't give us salvation but that don't mean that we don't do Works our works don't give us salvation but the Bible says but they certainly give you a reward see because many just chalk it up with salvation's a reward but listen what Jesus said he said I work I must work the works of him that sent me while it is day the night cometh when no man can work so here Jesus says we must work while it is day we must work well why he said we must do the works of the father so why would Jesus tell us to work if it ain't going to save you why would he tell you brother Jared to to do the works of God if it's never going to save you salvation's already done it's because God rewards you for everything that you do hello somebody it means god rewards you let let's just lay it out there plain you I know how people say Well everybody's going to get the same reward but let me tell you if if that was true brother Morgan then it would take take away the law of sewing and reaping it wouldn't matter what you sewed everybody reaps the same thing because we all get the same reward I I know the parable that Jesus told in Matthew the 20th chapter remember the parable of the laborers he said they came in the morning time and to to it was at the Harvest time they came in the morning to hire laborers into his Vineyard and he offered them a penny to work for the day and they agreed on it and they went out to work and then later in the day another came by or they went out into the market and they found those that had no work and said are you are you not working well no man is hired he said well come and help us cuz there's a great harvest he said I'll give you I'll give you a penny so they came to work and then at 6:00 they came again and at 9:00 they came again in the 11th Hour they came again and there were still servants that had no work and they brought them and said well we'll put you to work and put and they gave him a penny and the Bible says at the end of all of the day's work every man lined up in order to receive his pay and the last was first one to receive pay and when the last one he received his Penny and the next one received his Penny the next one received his Penny and the next one received a penny when it got down to the first that had been there laboring all day they were angered at the master and said how can you give them the same thing that you have given unto us and the master said to them he said I agreed to give you that and you agreed to work for it so how can you call me not good when I've done everything that I said i' do and I can give to anybody whatever I want to give them because I'm the master and the first shall be last but you realize that this Parable brother Mark it was showing us that the Gentile believer had what the Jews had it would show us that God God's chosen people that would be able that that that for thousands of years that God had led this nation and God had given them this great this great thing but it wasn't just for the Jews but Jesus was showing us that it was even for the gentile people also and they would be able to receive the same reward but remember said see he said see that that's what happened today with the Gentiles he said the seventh Angel's message was to open the mystery of the seals calling the 11th Hour Gentile workers to receive the same pay that the first hour workers got I I know this sounds contrary to what I said while ago but I'm building something he said they'll receive the first pay that the first workers got now Jesus Jesus taught it he said here here some would get paid remember all the way down they all received it he said but it's so perfectly how the first our Messengers came with the word with the gospel with the truth they came in at the day of Pentecost but then there came a Dark Age and it blocked them out and then at the middle of the day Martin Martin Luther and that group came in and they did their work and then and then towards the end of the day here comes Wesley but then it come to the east evening time message and they had to receive the same thing that they did at the beginning he say see the evening time message was to restore back again and to bring back that same thing again so brother Mark the evening light it wasn't meant to idolize some man it wasn't meant to bow down to some man in the evening time it wasn't meant to worship some man it wasn't to to become subject to somebody but there was one purpose for that evening L brother Wesley it was to cause people to dig back into the word of God and to receive the same pay that the early church received I thank God that there's somebody here this morning that could catch it that the Church of the Living God is supposed to receive the same thing that they received on the day of Pentecost and I have news for you this morning I think it's about time for payday I think it's time for the Church of the Living God to receive what was promised her I think it's time that the 11th our servant would come and collect what God has promised to the church by the Bible it's time it's time to collect it's time to to stop living away and and poverty and here in brother Mark and barely getting by in this age of leosia but God has promised you something and it's time to collect what he promised we're living at the end of an age we're living at a Rapture age we're living in an age where the Bible said that we ought to be ready and I think it's time that we collect the reward for the labor that we have been laboring for it's the Rapture age it's the time to receive what God has promised you listen listen what what what Peter said he said unto them behold remember he said to answering Peter Jesus said he said behold we have forsaken all we followed you what shall we receive this is what Peter the Jewish asked asked Jesus we followed you we forsaken all what shall we receive and Jesus said unto them verily I say unto you you that have followed me in the Regeneration when the son of man shall sit in the Throne of his glory you shall sit upon 12 Thrones judging the 12 tribes of Israel oh my you mean God would Elevate one man over another you mean you mean God would take one man and give him a higher reward than he would give another man I know this is the society we live in everything's equal you mean God would allow them to sit on a throne judging over the children of Israel he he would raise them up to another place and Elevate them and give them a higher reward let me tell you friends it wasn't just for Peter and The Disciples of the old day for Jesus went on to say and everyone somebody say everyone I know it's quiet this morning but everyone that has forsaken houses or brother or sisters or father father or mother or wife or children or lands for my name's sake shall receive a h hundredfold and shall inherit everlasting life for as many as are first shall be last and last shall be first let me tell you what it's a promise of it's a promise that God will reward you for everything that you ever give to him there ain't one thing you can ever do for the Gospel of Jesus Christ that God won't reward you for he said if you forsake a house I'll give you 100 fold if you forsake lands I'll give you 100 fold if you forsake family I'll give you 100 fold if you forsake money I'll give you 100 fold God will never leave you without it was a promise to the church in the last day my you read that Parable again after hearing that scripture you see it's showing us that we will received the same promise that your Jews had but he will but you'll also receive award a reward a great reward based on what you give isn't it something that our works mean something to God he'll always reward you why would Jesus put a number on it he'll give you a hundred times what you give aund times what you forsake why would he why would he put that see that that that stops me from looking at this saying well I'm just a Christian so I'm praise the Lord I'm gonna go sit over on a rock and I'm gonna have eternal life and you know what I believe that if you got saved and you and and you was really saved and gave your heart to the Lord that you could do just that and it would never take away your salvation on but he said but there's a work to do and I'll reward you for the works I don't know it makes me want to do something makes me want to do something for the Lord Jesus said blessed are you when men will revile you and persecute you and shall say all manner of evil against you for my name's sake rejoice and be exceedingly glad for great is your reward in heaven just because they talk about you he'll give you reward for it they'll make they'll say evil statements about you he said but you'll be rewarded in heaven for they persecuted the prophets which were before you and you're the salt of the earth see sacrifice don't come without reward there's a reward in heaven how many believe that Jesus said moreover when you fast don't be as the Hypocrites with a sad countenance and they disfigure their faces that they appear unto men to fast and he said I say unto you they have their reward but when you fast anoint thy head and wash thy face I oh God isn't it something about the people today I'm going on a five-day fast I'm gonna post it on Facebook I'm going on a f- day fast that ain't a sincere fast I'm taking a f- day fast I put I put $8 in the offering this morning anybody everybody know I put $8 in the offering that a that a that ain't a sincere offering he said but what you do for the Lord don't do it like they do it you do it in privately and he'll reward you openly it's a it's a sincere heart that you do something for the Lord we don't do things just to show off what we do we don't give to show off what we give to be recognized on this side it it boy just oh boy it just gets under my skin that somebody wants to that that every little Penny they do they want big great big recognition for it you got to Pat them on the back say brother everybody gives thank God for all of them and I I think we ought to thank thank everybody for what they give but man it can't be constant babyit every every time man I I you know I did this I did this I mean sometime we got to grow up and just be the ones that just do the work of the Lord and we know that our reward is waiting us and and we ain't going to not come to church tomorrow cuz we didn't get patted on the back or we're not going to get upset at everybody cuz we didn't get elevated high enough or we didn't get recognized in the service but I thank God there's some people that just come and do the service for the Lord and they do their work for God and they know there's a reward that's waiting for them my get L land she said I'll reward you openly where is this reward Jesus said lay not up for yourselves Treasures upon the Earth where moth and rust do corrupt where thieves break through and steal but lay yourselves Treasures in Heaven this is where the treasure is he said there ain't no rust no moth and thieves can't break through and steal for where your treasure is there will your heart be also brother Mar God has given us a reward it's an everlasting reward it can't fade away it it don't lose value it don't nothing but but increase it never decreases God just piles it on on and one day when you get over on the other side this this Earthly mind will never be able to Fathom the reward that God has given you for the persecution that you face for the people that walk by you and turn up their nose and they wouldn't shake their hand because of what you believe but friends one day God will give you a reward for it you just stand your ground and let him build up the reward you just stand on the truth I say God pile it up build a mountain of reward for the Saints of the Living God that'll stand true to his word it's an everlasting reward oh let me tell you Paul preached the same thing that Jesus did he said for there's no other Foundation can any man lay that is laid which is Christ Jesus If any man build upon his foundation gold or silver or stones or wood or hay or stubble Every Man's work will be made manifest for the day shall declare because it shall be revealed by fire and the fire shall try every man's work and if any man's work abide that he has built thereon he shall receive a what a reward in other word we build spiritual things and we'll be rewarded and that spiritual thing that we build it'll it'll stand the test of time it'll stand the fire of judgment he said for if any man's work could be burn he shall suffer loss CU that's all he did with his work but I love how Paul lays this in he said but he himself shall still be saved he didn't take away his salvation but he just didn't receive the reward the other guy did because all of his Works were done but the market was for natural things and Paul said it'll all be burnt it'll all be of nothing but he'll still be saved but I thank God he shows us a way that our treasure will be put somewhere that it would it would last our Treasures we build on this Earth brother Wesley they'll be lost but our treasure in heaven will be forever how many believe that it's an everlasting reward Brother David it's an Ever it's an everlasting life it's joy unspeakable it's a life without heartache and a life without pain and trial and sickness and death it's a reward that you that you'll never even be able to fathom see these rewards you think about the disciples they got rewarded the greatest the greatest possessions the greatest position they got they got the greatest blessing but that ain't what Jesus said let me tell you what Jesus said whenever Thomas came to him remember when they were he walked into the room and they didn't believe who he was and old Thomas D he said Thomas but reach in here and feel the nail scars and he felt the the scar in his side and he said but then he believed it was him and Jesus said to him he said Thomas because you have seen me you have believed and blessed are they but blessed are they that have not not seen and yet they have believed butam say See Jesus is Alive and he's among the people today I know he's here right now he's here and he lives you might not see him with a Corporal body but but but he's still here you might not be able to touch him but he's still here you may not be able to talk to him lift to ear but he's still here he said that's why he said to Thomas how much greater is their reward who has never seen me but they can believe oh friends think about it if the reward that the disciples got was great for those that seen him then what about you this morning for those that walk with him if they got that great of a reward then what about you he said for greater is your reward that can believe that has not seen some things you might not understand but you say I still believe it well great is your reward some things you might not be able to explain but I still believe it great is your reward some I I may not be able to I may not be able to teach it to somebody else but but I still believe it well great is your reward why is your reward so great that makes I don't know I don't know why I don't do that to y'all but it makes me want run all over this building that God would give you a greater reward just for being a Believer just for being a Believer I wasn't there when they when they walked on the shores of Galilee I didn't carry his purse I I didn't I didn't pack pack his pack his sandals I didn't kneel down and wash his feet but he said a greater reward you'll receive just for believing and having not seen there's a great reward that lays for you following Jesus comes with a price but it comes with a great reward see what is this great sacrifice God requires should I donate all my money should I give all my time just pour it all in maybe that'll be it well anything you do it'll be rewarded but listen what God really wants he wants obedience to the word of God Bible says obedience is better than sacrifice listen what watch when he called Peter do I got a few minutes he said unto them follow me and I will make you Fishers of me men you notice what happened the Bible says and straight away they left their Nets and they followed him you know what that shows you obedience to the call of God he called them and stayed away they left their Nets and they followed him and he going went from there and he saw two brothers James and Son of zebede and John's brother and when they came to them they were mened their Nets and Jesus called them and the Bible says and immediately they left the ship and their father and they followed him see it was a call of God and it was obedience to the call of Jesus Christ is what made them disciples see that's what a disciple is a disciple is one who follows that's what Jesus has called us to be in this age he's called us to be Disciples of Jesus Christ you can read in Matthew the 8th chapter Jesus said unto them follow me and let the B dead bury the dead Matthew 16 he said to the disciples If any man will come after me let him deny himself take up his cross and follow me in John the 10th chapter he said my sheep hear my voice I know them and they follow me see so to follow him would be would would make you a disciple of Jesus Christ and being a disciple it has a reward but it also has a commission I know I know this is it may not be fired up here but it has a commission go into the world and preach the gospel that was the commission that he gave to us butam said and he don't change that if he still got disciples today they'll still have the same commission go into all the world and preach the gospel and these signs shall follow them that that believe it'll never change our commission is the same brother Ben it'll it'll be the same as it was to them and go into the world and preach the gospel let me ask you this if our commission is the same what was the purpose of the preaching of the Gospel it was to call others to follow Christ that was the purpose of them so the call that you were called with is the same call that you go forth with so he said come and follow me so then he said I give you a call now you go forth and preach the gospel that gospel is the same call so your call is the same call that Jesus gave you come and follow me now you see the words that Paul spoke was these very words he said follow me as I follow Christ see sometimes read that people think it's hard to follow well Paul was trying to get people to follow after him and Paul was trying to be the one that that they wouldn't that they that he'd be the the intermediary between them and God but he said follow me as I follow Christ how important was Paul's request to the church see because because what you call someone to is whose disciple that you are and Paul made this plain he said follow me as I follow Christ see because if you was a disciple of a Baptist Church you'd say come and follow me and I'll make a Baptist out of you come and follow me to the Baptist Church and sign we'll get you a membership card and then then you can be a Baptist if you're if you're a disciple of a Methodist will come follow me and become a Methodist if you're a disciple of of a presbyterian or a Pentecost come follow me you can be a Pentecost he said but but but see but what but what a disciple is is is is he calls someone to whose disciple that they are so so what if they would call to the church well what would a disciple of Jesus Jesus Christ point you to he would point you to the same place that Jesus pointed you to so what was it that Jesus pointed you to Jesus said he said except the corn of wheat falls into the ground it'll abide alone he said but if it will die then it'll bring forth much fruit you see where Jesus pointed when they asked Jesus about himself brother Mark he pointed to his own death he said except the corn of wheat would fall into the ground brother I love a prophet he picked that up he said see where Jesus pointed he said your life and his life will only find each other it won't be at a church it won't be in a building it won't be in a Creed it won't be in good works but it'll only be in the cross where you are crucified with him that's where you'll find Christ you'll never find Christ by doing better you'll never find Christ by turning another page you'll never find Christ by start by starting a new life you won't find Christ there you won't find him in a Manger you won't find him in a confession boot but you won't find him in a Creed or in a fable you won't find Christ but you'll only find Christ in death Jesus pointed that and any true disciple of Christ will point to the same thing the only place you'll ever find Christ it ain't the church it ain't Grace Tabernacle that ain't what we're trying to get people to but it's Jesus Christ it's a life with Jesus Christ that you can go to this place of death and you can meet him at the cross and brother said when you come to this place and you meet him there he said your life and his life will find each other that's where you find Jesus Christ they'll find each other and you'll become a servant of him you'll only find him in his death in a true servant will take you to him you say well where is he he's in his word isn't that what the Bible said the Bible says in the beginning was the word the word was with God and the Word was God and the Word was made flesh and dwelt Among Us in other words the logos of God was made flesh and it came to this earth and he walked upon this Earth and that logos of God called people to come and follow him and brother said that same word today Never Dies it's still a challenge to every young man and every young woman follow me it's still the same call the word that called on the day of Pentecost is the word that's calling forth today it ain't some man saying come and follow me and come after me it's the same word that came out of the mouth of Jesus it's the same word that came out of the mouth of Paul it's the same word that came out of the mouth of William brandom it's the same word that's being preached here today come and follow me as I follow Jesus Christ the word is calling us to come and follow what's a big difference from what the world has done today you these dis to I'm going to get myself in trouble the disciples today ain't like the Disciples of old the disciples today they'll bring you to a church and teach you a Creed make you memorize something take you to a Christmas party see Santa Claus and Easter money and all this stuff or bring you to an organization but Christ brought them to the Cross except a corn of wheat would fall into the ground when they come to meet him this was his answer except a corn of wheat would fall into the ground he would abide alone Christ led him to the Cross said and when you get a real disciple that appoint you to Christ Christ will bring you to the Cross where you are crucified with him and his eternal life and your life will meet together and your life will die and you'll take on his eternal life and you're a Son of God what a difference from the Disciples of old and The Disciples of today friends I thank God for some true disciples today that'll still lead you to Jesus Christ I thank God for some real men and women that'll still preach the gospel not to build a church and not to build a name for their s or not to make yourself look like some big somebody but brother Mark to lead you to Jesus Christ there's a people today that are disciples they're following the reality of a living God a word that's still alive it's a living bride following a Living Word they're worshiping a living God said I don't F I'm not worshiping a Jew I don't worship a god when I wor but I worship God when I worship Jesus Christ I don't worship some fiction or some kind of historical thing I worship Jesus Christ in the presence of Jesus Christ right now which is his word that's manifested in this age so if you want to follow Christ or ain't but one way to do it is to follow God's word that has been manifested that's the way to follow him so that why that's what Christ is he's here in the form of his word and a true servant listen a true servant would take you to him and I know they say well Christ is on the Earth today a real servant would take you to him that's true he said but where is he Christ is here in the form of the word and the word is what brings life because he is the word and Christ is the word yes sir he is the word himself and the true servant will always take you to the word of God say what word is it brother Mark it's the word with a true interpretation it's the word of God that's been manifested today that's why there was so much Supernatural that was surrounding brother braham's Ministry you think about this because it would cause you to follow a messenger to Christ why would God bring gifts and in the spirit of Prophecy and Supernatural upon someone's life it was the cause it was a it it was the purpose was to attract the attention of people that the messenger could lead you to Christ as any true Messenger would I'd be a false messenger if I got up here and say you need to come to my church and and you need to you need to give us money and you need to support it'd be a false messenger but a true Messenger says you need to surrender to Christ you need to follow the will of God in your life you you need to allow God to lead you you need to be led by the holy spirit for the sons of God are led by the spirit of God but he had that Supernatural in his life I'm going to close but he had that Supernatural in his life for the purpose brother Jared it was it it would it would cause you to look to him just like Paul Paul worked miracles it caused you to look to him and it caused Paul to say follow me as I follow Christ not to not to build Paul not to build attention to him and brother Bram didn't do this didn't do it either he never done it to build his own name or to draw attention to himself but he said but to follow Jesus Christ that's a true Messenger of God that app point you to Christ my think about it what was it it was the The Word Alive in human flesh again pointing you to the reality of the resurrection of Jesus Christ can I tell you what I saw in this briefly as the music players would come in every age Christ has presented himself to every Church in every age he comes this same way you know it's how he presented him brother Mark he said he that hath an ear let him hear what the spirit saith unto the church every age he presents himself to the church and under the messenger of every Church he spoke to every church and then when he come to this last age in Le oia here stands a church this is what I saw when I read this here stands a church that the Bible said was rich and increased with Goods but God would come in the form of a messenger just like he done to every church and he would speak to them I thought my hear this can I call her this this Rich Young church that met him and they have an opportunity in the middle of this this Rich Young church that that had been experienced the the the the outpouring of Pentecost began to rise up and hear that gift of of the Holy Ghost came right into the middle of where they are brother Mark and you know one day there was this group of businessmen they went down into a meeting and brother Brown preaches this message to him come follow me here they were those that had M multi-millionaires and made great Investments building up these great Pentecostal organizations I thought friends if they could only see what was being presented to them that day the word had come alive the super natural had come alive the power of God had come alive and here that same Jesus that spoke before was speaking through a man again the same Spirit it was the same holy ghost that said come follow me wasn't trying to get them to to follow after old man but it was the same words that Paul spoke come follow me as I follow Christ brother Mark you know what I saw I saw that rich young church that was sitting there like the Rich Young Ruler was that day and saying what must I do to have eternal life and that messenger said to her if I will be perfect and sell all that thou have and give it to the poor you shall have treasure in heaven and come and follow me I'll make you a glorious Church you'll be a spy you you you you'll be a church without a spot or a wrinkle I I'll raise you up above every Church there there'll never be a church to ever touch what you'll be able to do with the spirit of God but the young Church they heard the saying and she went away sorrowful because she had great possessions great followings great wealth great Cathedrals that she had built and she knew that if I was to give up something like that I'd have to give up my reputation if I'd follow something can you imagine those men in that day I'm preaching to you now can you imagine the men in that day of Paul what they' had to give up to follow after Paul I I give up my membership in the synagogue to come follow after Paul and Paul's wanted he's a wanted they got wanted posters of him over how could I follow after a man like that I'd have to give up my membership I I'd have to give up my my status in society people would look down on me if I followed him this Rich Young church he had the same opportunity but I'd had to give up my seat in society I'd have to give up my friendships and my my fellowship card over at the church but he knew there was some I love this but Jesus he didn't give up on them he knew there was some in there that would still come out you know what he did Brother Wesley he didn't just go away he didn't just leave the Rich Young Ruler and say well he wouldn't accept it so I'm never going to make that call again but the Bible said he continued to call he raised men up and they continued to call it didn't discourage Jesus and make him give up his give up his cuse and it didn't discourage him and leot deia either for the Bible says whenever she wouldn't accept him I've got great possessions I I I can't I I can't I can't do that but the Bible said but he said behold I stand at the door and knock brother Joe what was he doing he just kept calling and kept calling he kept preaching and he kept ministering and the word of God kept going forth and the Holy Ghost it anointed other men and they heard the call of God and they got on fire for the Lord and they went out forth and they made the same call that was called upon them he said they'll keep calling and he that'll hear my voice and open the door I will come in unto him and sck with him and he with me friends you realize what you're hearing this morning it ain't just some old country boy preaching to you but it's that same knock of God in the middle of Le oia that says I stand at the door and knock and if any man will hear my voice and will open the door I will come in unto him I will s with him and he with me it's God that is calling us to open the door to the revelation of the word of God that he could come in and have communion with the Church of the Living God that he could lift you out of the spirit of Le oosa and the confusion that goes along with it he's still preaching the word of God he's calling for disciples to come and follow him and the Bible said and to he that does to he that overcometh will I grant to sit with me in my throne even as I O overcame and I'm sit down with my father in his throne he that over he that he that will he to this call that'll become a Believer it'll make you an overcomer brother Mark it'll give you the Throne of Glory it wasn't just for the Disciples of old he said but you come and sit with me you're not just to be a on a throne over over some group of people but Jesus said but you'll come and sit with me in my Throne man that Wonder greater is the reward for those that believe that have not seen than those that had my what a great reward we have today won't you stand to your feet isn't it wonderful to

by that little girl back there or that young lady back there and told her to come and tell the testimony she was being obedient she was being led by the spirit of God to come and tell a testimony so
