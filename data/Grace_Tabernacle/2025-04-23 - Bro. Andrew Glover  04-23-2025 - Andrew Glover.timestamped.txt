[30:14] How many's been fighting a battle? Amen.
[30:17] It's a battle that he's already won.
[30:20] I thought about that, Brother Brian. I
[30:22] was like, the battle that Satan creates
[30:26] is not even for his benefit. It's for
[30:28] yours. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. We're on
[30:31] the winning side tonight. Aren't you
[30:33] thankful for that? Amen. We got a prayer
[30:36] request. We're going to just take this
[30:37] as they talk take the offering up this
[30:39] evening.
[30:40] This brother Juan's stepdad got an
[30:43] infection in his fingers, turned septic,
[30:46] had to have surgery today. So, let's
[30:48] just remember him and his family
[30:49] tonight. And if you got a need upon your
[30:51] heart, I want you to make it known by
[30:53] the uplifting of your hands. And God's
[30:55] so mindful every one of our needs. And
[30:58] we're just praying our own way and all
[31:00] over the offering as well tonight. Lord
[31:01] Jesus, Lord, we thank you, Lord, for
[31:04] this opportunity, Lord, that you've
[31:05] given us this side of glory, Lord. Lord,
[31:08] as we sat in the service Sunday, we we
[31:11] felt and seen the very touch of heaven
[31:14] come down, Lord God, a foretaste of
[31:17] something coming, Lord. It's going to be
[31:19] so great. Lord, we got the earnest right
[31:22] now, Lord God. It's a resurrecting of
[31:25] the soul, as brother Andrew brought it
[31:27] so clearly. It's Easter again, Father.
[31:30] Lord, we rejoice, Lord, over the
[31:34] fellowship we had over the weekend,
[31:35] Lord. But we're looking forward to
[31:36] another good time tonight, Lord God. Do
[31:39] you realize tonight the battle's already
[31:41] been won, it's already been conquered,
[31:43] Lord, the very battle that we're facing,
[31:45] Lord, and it's going to give us
[31:47] strength. As they went down, Jonathan
[31:49] took his rod and dipped it down into the
[31:51] honey and drew strength for the journey
[31:53] and the battle, Lord. I believe it's the
[31:55] same going on right now for the
[31:57] believers, Lord. Every time we have need
[31:59] of, there's honey in the rock, Father.
[32:02] Well, Lord, we thank you for your
[32:03] presence tonight, Lord. This is another
[32:05] service, Lord. We're expecting great
[32:07] things tonight, Lord. We just pray over
[32:09] these requests, Lord, for the one's
[32:11] stepfather. Lord, we pray that you'll
[32:13] minister his needs tonight and every
[32:15] hand that was risen, Lord. Bless your
[32:17] offering and your tithing tonight. We
[32:18] pray in Jesus Christ's name. And the
[32:22] bride says, "Amen."
[32:24] Hallelujah.
[32:26] This ain't God's not dead.
[32:31] Well, God's not dead.
[32:35] He is alive where God's not
[32:39] dead. He is alive where God's not
[32:44] dead. He is alive. Well, I feel him in
[32:48] my hands. I feel him in my feet. Oh, I

[40:35] God. Amen. Amen. Anytime believers get
[40:38] together, something good always happens.
[40:40] Amen. And Amen. You can't get this many
[40:42] Holy Ghost people together and the
[40:45] spirit of the Lord not come among the
[40:46] church and do something special for us.
[40:49] Amen. Want to say God bless you all
[40:51] tonight. And it is a real honor to be
[40:53] back in the house of God with you again
[40:54] on a Wednesday evening. We thank our
[40:56] pastor, brother Matt, for this
[40:58] opportunity and invitation to speak to
[41:00] you tonight. And we just pray that we

[41:07] Amen. It is a real real uh strength,
[41:09] amen, to see your presence here in the
[41:11] house of God on a Wednesday night. And
[41:13] Amen. I know um I was listening the
[41:15] other day to a sermon uh from a friend
[41:17] of mine over in Africa, Brother Steven
[41:19] Abbali, and he was ministering. And he
[41:21] made a statement. He said, 'You know, he
[41:23] said, uh, if you love the church, you're
[41:25] there on Sunday morning. He said, if you
[41:27] love the pastor, you're there on Sunday
[41:29] night. He said, and if you love God,
[41:31] you're there on Wednesday night. Amen. I
[41:33] love something he said. He said, "Y'all
[41:35] know I used to only preach Revelation on
[41:37] Wednesday night." He said, "Cuz that was
[41:38] a night the believers were there." And I
[41:40] tell you, Brother David, that kind of
[41:42] got a hold of me. Amen. Amen. It's good
[41:44] tonight to be here with believers. Amen.
[41:46] I know there's there's different
[41:48] situations. people's not always able to
[41:50] be here, but we do want to say God bless
[41:52] you all. I know we see brother Ed there
[41:53] and your wife have been driving quite a
[41:55] ways to be here. God bless you all. And
[41:56] there's many driving a ways to be here
[41:58] on a Wednesday night. And Amen. What a
[42:00] strength it is to serve it, Lord. Let's
[42:01] just bow our hearts together tonight.
[42:03] How many just say, "Lord, on this
[42:05] midweek service, come by and speak to me
[42:07] tonight." Amen. Come by in the power of
[42:10] your word and minister to my needs.
[42:11] Heavenly Father, Lord, as your believers
[42:14] have gathered here this evening on this
[42:17] Wednesday afternoon, Father, pulling
[42:19] away from the things of life and the
[42:21] cares of the world and situations and
[42:23] homes and different problems they're
[42:25] facing. Lord, they've deemed this moment
[42:27] a very valuable time to come to your
[42:29] house. And Lord, I know as I look across
[42:32] this building tonight, there's many
[42:33] people that Lord have had to walk away
[42:35] from things today and leave them till
[42:37] the morning. But Lord, there's something
[42:39] in their hearts that's desiring to be in
[42:41] your house. For Lord, they know that
[42:43] wherever the word is, where the carcass
[42:45] is, they're pulled to be there. And
[42:47] Lord, I as a human, I have nothing to
[42:49] offer this people. But Lord, I know if
[42:52] you will come among us, if you will step
[42:54] from the pages of this book and you'll
[42:56] begin to reveal yourself. And as your
[42:58] word goes forth, Lord, it'll begin to
[43:00] discern the thoughts and intents of the
[43:02] heart. And Lord, we know that miracles
[43:04] can take place right here. I know Lord
[43:06] that on the calendar or we've not passed
[43:08] out flyers or announcements that this
[43:10] would be a special meeting. But Lord,
[43:12] whenever eagles get together, it's
[43:14] always special. So Lord, I know right
[43:16] here tonight that miracles can take
[43:18] place in bodies. Lord, I know right here
[43:20] tonight that deliverances and empty
[43:22] vessels, oh God, can be filled with your
[43:25] presence. Lord, I know there's believers
[43:26] at home tonight that would would love to
[43:29] be here. Father, I think of our sister
[43:30] Leah there recovering from that surgery,
[43:32] Lord. Father, how you're bringing her
[43:34] right along, Lord, desiring to be in the
[43:36] house of God. I know, Lord, you can go
[43:38] by her house tonight and you can go by
[43:40] the elders that's unable to be here
[43:42] tonight. You can sweep through their
[43:43] living rooms, oh God. And Lord, you can
[43:46] speak to them and you can break a piece
[43:47] of bread unto them, Father, because you
[43:50] are the omnipresent God, and you're the
[43:52] same yesterday, today, and forever. Now,
[43:54] Lord, move among us tonight as we look
[43:56] into your word. And we'll be sure to
[43:57] give thee all the praise, all the honor,
[43:59] and all the glory in the wonderful name
[44:01] of our Lord. and Savior Jesus Christ. We
[44:04] pray and all the believers says amen and
[44:08] amen. God bless you this evening. If you
[44:10] have your Bibles while you're standing
[44:12] with us, we want to go to St. Luke
[44:14] chapter 24. Amen. St. Luke chapter 24.
[44:17] Amen. This be the last time we'll be
[44:19] speaking to you for a few days. I'll be
[44:21] leaving this weekend for Georgia and
[44:23] then heading over to Virginia to the
[44:25] tent meetings there. I know brother Matt
[44:26] and some of the folks here will be in
[44:28] those meetings as well. So, amen. And if
[44:30] y'all just give me a little grace, I'm
[44:31] going to pour my heart out to you
[44:32] tonight. Amen. St. Luke chapter
[44:35] 24 and verse number 16. Amen. I tell
[44:39] you, still still feasting on the mighty
[44:41] things God done for us Sunday. Amen.
[44:44] Amen. There's no better way to celebrate
[44:45] Easter than hearts coming up to give
[44:47] their heart to God. Amen. St. Luke
[44:50] chapter 24 and verse 16. Bible says,
[44:53] "But their eyes were holden that they
[44:56] should not know him. And he said unto
[44:58] them, "What manner of communication are
[45:00] these that ye have one to another?" I
[45:03] want you to notice this, "As you walk,
[45:06] and are sad?" And one of them, now
[45:09] notice this, and one of them, whose name
[45:11] was Cleopus, answered unto him, "Art
[45:13] thou only a stranger in Jerusalem, and
[45:15] hast not known the things which are come
[45:17] to pass therein in these days?" Now, in
[45:21] the in Luke 24 and verse 31, I want to
[45:24] read there again. We've just read where
[45:26] the Bible said their eyes were closed.
[45:29] But here in verse 31, Christ reveals
[45:31] himself in the breaking of the bread.
[45:33] And the Bible says, "And their eyes were
[45:35] opened and they knew him." So their eyes
[45:38] were closed. Now their eyes is open and
[45:40] they knew him. And he vanished out of
[45:43] their sight. And they said one to
[45:45] another, "Did not our heart burn within
[45:48] us?" Now watch this. while he talked us
[45:51] by the way and while he opened to us the
[45:54] scriptures. Now in the book of
[45:56] Ephesians, Paul writing in Ephesians
[45:58] chapter 1, I want to read there
[45:59] Ephesians chapter 1 and verse number 17.
[46:03] Paul here writing, he's given a prayer
[46:06] for the Ephesian church in Ephesians
[46:08] 1:17. He says that the God of our Lord
[46:10] Jesus Christ, the father of glory may
[46:13] give unto you the spirit of wisdom and
[46:17] revelation. Somebody say revelation.
[46:19] Revelation. Now this revelation is in
[46:21] the knowledge of him that the eyes of
[46:24] your understanding be enlightened. I
[46:27] want you to watch that ye may know what
[46:29] is the hope of his calling and what the
[46:32] riches of the glory of his inheritance
[46:34] in the saints. Now that sounds like
[46:37] you're reading Luke 24, but now you're
[46:39] reading it under Paul. And he's saying
[46:41] their eyes were enlightened and there
[46:43] they come open that they may know him.
[46:45] Now look at verse 19. And what is the
[46:47] exceeding greatness of his power to
[46:50] usward who work it out and figure it out
[46:53] and memorize it and learn it to work
[46:56] unto us who believe according to the
[46:59] working of his mighty power. Amen. We
[47:03] ask the Lord this evening to add the
[47:04] blessing to the reading of his word as
[47:05] you can have your seats here this
[47:07] evening. I want to by the help of the
[47:08] Lord if I would take a title tonight. I
[47:11] want to speak to you on this. And our
[47:13] eyes have been opened and we know him.
[47:17] Our eyes have been opened and we know
[47:19] him. I can say this to you under a
[47:22] greater and deeper meaning tonight.
[47:24] Amen. It's Easter again. Amen. To think
[47:27] when we were closing there on Sunday,
[47:28] speaking of how that Peter, Amen, was
[47:31] was knowing that Jesus had been
[47:32] crucified, he knew he was in a tomb and
[47:35] he had gotten so discouraged. Brother
[47:36] Tommy just went back to the thing he
[47:38] knew. He knew how to fish and he knew
[47:40] all those things. But then the Bible
[47:42] tells us, amen, that Jesus had a message
[47:44] for Peter. And that message was, I am
[47:47] not dead, but I am alive and I will meet
[47:49] you in the place I promised. And you
[47:51] know, I just have to maybe ask you all
[47:53] to forgive me tonight. I probably lost a
[47:55] little bit of my my pullpit manner
[47:57] Sunday morning closing. But it just
[47:59] struck my heart. Amen. the reality that
[48:02] God, amen, is not just wanting us to
[48:04] look back and see that their eyes were
[48:06] open and they knew him, but rather he's
[48:09] wanting our eyes to come open and us to
[48:11] know him in the same way that they knew
[48:13] him. Now, in the message when their eyes
[48:15] were open, brother said, "I think the
[48:17] main thing that I'm trying to bring to
[48:19] you is the reality of the presence of
[48:21] Christ." Amen. the reality of the
[48:24] presence of Christ that you might see
[48:26] him and know that it is him by his
[48:29] identified promise for this day. Now, I
[48:32] love that we're not just going to see
[48:34] him. We're not just going to read about
[48:36] him, but we're going to see him and
[48:39] we're going to know him. In Luke 24,
[48:41] Jesus said their eyes were holding,
[48:44] amen, that they should not know him. And
[48:45] just re laying a foundation, that word
[48:47] holden, amen, was a death continuing to
[48:50] hold one. Amen. But that that death had
[48:53] to lose its hold. Amen. Because they
[48:55] were going to know him, which means they
[48:57] were going to be thoroughly acquainted
[48:58] with and they were going to know him
[49:01] accurately. Amen. They were not just
[49:02] going to know him, but they were going
[49:04] to know him accurately. I love this. And
[49:07] they were going to understand him. Amen.
[49:09] He says, "And their eyes were opened and
[49:11] they knew him." Amen. And he vanished
[49:14] out of their sight and they said one to
[49:16] another, "Now watch. Did not our heart,
[49:19] Amen. burn within us while he talked
[49:21] with us by the way. I love that it
[49:23] doesn't say did not our hearts burned
[49:25] within us or will not our hearts burn
[49:27] within us but this was amen a present
[49:30] tense burning amen of the revelation in
[49:33] their hearts amen and that word burn
[49:35] means to kindle it means to consume it
[49:37] means to agree amen I love that when
[49:40] something is burning it means you are
[49:42] agreeing with it amen and here the Bible
[49:44] said that they were walking amen with
[49:47] him in the resurrection and did not our
[49:49] hearts agree with him as he was talking
[49:52] to us along the way. I want to say to
[49:54] you, how can two, Amen, walk together
[49:57] except they be agreed? Amen. I want to
[50:00] say we're not walking with God. Amen.
[50:02] And disagreeing with God, Amen. But
[50:04] rather, we're walking with God. And as
[50:06] we're fellowshipping with him, we are
[50:08] having communion with him. And we are
[50:11] agreeing with him. Amen. More than we
[50:13] are agreeing with the things that's
[50:15] around us. Listen, I don't know about
[50:16] you, but I'm not here tonight in an
[50:18] agreement with my sickness. or I'm not
[50:20] here in an agreement with complexes or
[50:22] in an agreement with denomination. I
[50:25] refuse to agree, amen, with something
[50:27] that disagrees with God's word. But as
[50:30] we are walking with him, he is opening
[50:32] the scriptures to us. And that word open
[50:35] means to open one's soul. And the
[50:37] prophet of God said, "See, the light has
[50:39] come." Amen. As we have need of it, God
[50:42] says it. Amen. And it isn't open to us.
[50:44] Amen. because it's hid to our eyes until
[50:47] the day that God is able to reveal it.
[50:50] Amen. Somebody say until the day. Until
[50:52] the day. Until the day, amen, that God
[50:55] is able to reveal it. Now, I want to say
[50:57] this. The question tonight, amen, is not
[51:00] whether God is able to reveal it. As a
[51:02] matter of fact, he is more than able,
[51:05] amen, to reveal himself in the hour that
[51:07] we're living in. But the question is,
[51:09] amen, is there going to be a people who
[51:12] is going to be able to receive or going
[51:15] to be able to agree with what's being
[51:17] revealed to them or open to them? Isaiah
[51:20] prophesied. He said, "Whom shall teach
[51:22] knowledge?" Brother said, "Now that's
[51:23] not worldly knowledge." Amen. That's
[51:26] spiritual knowledge. And whom shall he
[51:27] make to understand doctrine? Amen. Them
[51:30] that are weaned from the milk. Amen. And
[51:32] drawn from the breast. He said, listen
[51:34] to this. Amen. All the tables are full
[51:37] of vomitage. He said there's no clean
[51:39] place. Now think about that. All the
[51:41] tables, denominations, amen, are full of
[51:44] vomit. And there is no clean tables to
[51:46] feed upon outside of the message of the
[51:49] hour. He said, "So who shall I teach
[51:51] knowledge? And who shall he make known
[51:53] to understand doctrine?" Amen. Them that
[51:56] are weaned from the milk. Amen. And
[51:58] drawn from the breast. He said, "They're
[52:00] not little babies." Presbyterian babies,
[52:02] Methodist babies, Pentecostal babies.
[52:04] Amen. Lutheran babies, Nazarene babies.
[52:07] Amen. He wants somebody that's willing.
[52:09] Amen. To get away from the breast. Amen.
[52:12] And eat some strong meat. He said, "Now
[52:15] here it comes." Amen. For precept must
[52:17] be upon precept. Amen. And line upon
[52:20] line. Here a little and there a little.
[52:22] Amen. Now watch. Here it comes. Amen.
[52:25] The word being revealed is the meat that
[52:28] will move you. Amen. From being a pave
[52:30] in Christ. Amen. to being a fully
[52:32] matured adopted son and daughter of God.
[52:35] That's why Daniel said, "Thou, oh
[52:37] Daniel, shut up the words." Amen. And
[52:39] seal the book even to the time of the
[52:42] end. For many shall run to and fro.
[52:44] Amen. And knowledge shall be increased.
[52:46] Amen. John said it like this in
[52:48] Revelation 1:3. He said, "Blessed is he
[52:51] that readeth, and they that hear the
[52:53] words of this prophecy, Amen. And they
[52:55] keep those things which are written
[52:57] therein." Now watch, for the time is at
[53:00] hand. Amen. Do you know the Bible said
[53:02] in Revelation 22:10, "Amen, seal not the
[53:05] sayings of the prophecy of this book."
[53:07] Amen. For the time is at hand. Listen,
[53:11] they could not be revealed until the
[53:13] time that the bride come onto the earth.
[53:16] Amen. Because there was no one else
[53:17] could agree with the word except the
[53:20] word itself. That's why the prophet of
[53:22] God said, "Down in your soul, there was
[53:24] a predestinated seed." Amen. He said it
[53:27] was the word seeing the word. Amen. It
[53:30] was the word coming to the word. That's
[53:32] why the prophet of God said it's not
[53:33] you. Amen. In the word, Amen. But it's
[53:36] the word on the inside of you agreeing
[53:39] with itself. Listen, your flesh don't
[53:41] agree with the fact, Amen. that there's
[53:43] a God on the inside of you. Amen. That's
[53:46] greater than that flesh is. But there is
[53:48] a gene seed of God on the inside of your
[53:51] soul. Amen. And the word agrees with the
[53:54] word. I love what Jesus said. He said,
[53:57] "Even thus shall it be in the day, amen,
[54:00] when the Son of man is revealed." In
[54:02] John 14:20, he said, "At that day ye
[54:05] shall know, amen, that I am in the
[54:08] Father and ye in me and I in you." At
[54:11] that day, Brother Joe, you're not going
[54:13] to be guessing. Amen. You're not going
[54:15] to be disagreeing. You're not going to
[54:17] be, Amen, presuming, but you're going to
[54:19] know, Amen, that all that was in God, he
[54:22] poured into Christ. and all that is
[54:25] Christ has been poured into the church.
[54:27] He said, what did he say in Malachi 4?
[54:30] He said he would restore. Amen. He would
[54:32] bring back the original Pentecostal
[54:34] faith with the same Pentecostal message,
[54:37] with the same Pentecostal sign, with the
[54:39] same Pentecostal evidence, the same God.
[54:42] Amen. The same power and the same
[54:44] teaching. Hallelujah. Hey, when the word
[54:47] comes open, it's not just bringing
[54:49] emotion to shout. It's not just bringing
[54:52] anointing to see gifts operate. But when
[54:54] the word comes open, it is bringing an
[54:57] ability to be able to be taught by the
[54:59] word itself. Listen, we're not under a
[55:02] strange teaching, folks. We have come
[55:04] underneath the word and we are believing
[55:07] the same teaching. And that's why we're
[55:09] having the kind of services that we're
[55:11] having. Amen. It's not because of the
[55:13] music. Amen. It's not because of the
[55:15] program. It's because the prophecy of
[55:18] Isaiah has been fulfilled. There is now
[55:20] a clean place where the word can be
[55:22] taught and sons and daughters of God can
[55:25] hear the word and say that ain't nothing
[55:27] but the truth. They can hear the
[55:29] revelation and they can agree with the
[55:32] revelation because our eyes have come
[55:34] open and now we know it's not a man
[55:37] teaching us. It's not a preacher
[55:39] teaching us. Amen. It's the son of man.
[55:42] Amen. Revealed in human flesh. Amen.
[55:45] teaching the church as the bridegroom
[55:47] being the word and the bride being the
[55:50] hearer of the word. They come together
[55:52] in a union. See, amen. They unite like a
[55:54] wedding. Hallelujah. At that day, you'll
[55:57] know what all the father is. I am. Ain't
[56:01] that powerful? All the father is, I am.
[56:05] And all I am, you are. Well, for the
[56:08] first time, Amen. There's somebody on
[56:11] the earth that can agree with John
[56:12] 14:20. Hey, and at that day you will
[56:15] know that you are in me and I am in you.
[56:18] Amen. Now watch. See at that day. Amen.
[56:21] What day? That's this day. Amen. I don't
[56:24] know if you can EQ this. It's changed
[56:26] drastically. Amen. See at that day. What
[56:28] day? This day. See, we find out the
[56:31] great hidden mysteries of God. Amen. Are
[56:34] being revealed. Now watch. So we are
[56:37] living in the day that God promised more
[56:39] than just a sermon. He promised more
[56:42] than just a Bible study. But he promised
[56:44] a revealing or an understanding would
[56:47] come to the church. He said, "Now you
[56:49] cannot add nothing to the book or take
[56:51] nothing from it." See, amen. Who will
[56:53] ever add one word or take one word? His
[56:56] part will be taken from the book of
[56:58] life. Now, we cannot add amen. Or we
[57:00] cannot take Can I establish something to
[57:03] you? The message of the hour is not
[57:06] something added to the word of God. And
[57:08] it's not something being taken away from
[57:10] the word of God. Amen. The message of
[57:12] the hour, amen, is the revelation of the
[57:16] word that's being laying there in simple
[57:18] form. He said Luther could not get it.
[57:20] Wesley, Knox, Finny, Calvin, none of
[57:22] them could get it. But now in the last
[57:24] days, in the last days, we are given the
[57:27] understanding by the word that we are
[57:30] going to understand it. See, because
[57:32] it'll come to an Ephesian age. And we're
[57:34] here. Amen. Now, listen, folks. It's not
[57:37] just a preacher, amen, saying it's
[57:39] coming. Amen. It's coming. But it took a
[57:41] prophet to say, "We're here." It took a
[57:44] prophet, amen, to put his finger on Luke
[57:46] 17:30 and John 14:20 and Malachi 4 and
[57:51] Revelations 10. Amen. And say, "Listen,
[57:53] that's not coming. That's here." And you
[57:56] can agree with it. And if you can agree
[57:58] with it, then your eyes will come open
[58:01] to the power that's laying behind it. If
[58:03] you can agree that all that was in God
[58:06] is in you, then there ain't a devil big
[58:08] enough. There ain't a spirit bad enough.
[58:11] There ain't a demon hideous enough,
[58:13] amen, to defeat a son and daughter of
[58:15] God on their way to receive the
[58:17] fulfillment of the promise. I'll say
[58:19] this. Let me make an announcement. What
[58:21] we need is what we got.
[58:25] Well, somebody shout hallelujah. What we
[58:28] need is what we got. He said, "And what
[58:30] we need is an opening of the word that
[58:33] lives. That he's the same yesterday,
[58:36] today, and forever." I love the prompt
[58:39] of God's word. Let me read this quote to
[58:41] you. He said, "Lord, I cannot fill
[58:43] nobody with the Holy Ghost." He said,
[58:45] "Neither can I save anybody. I can only
[58:48] tell them what you said that blessed are
[58:50] they that do hunger and thirst for
[58:53] righteousness, for they shall be
[58:55] filled." He said, "And I pray God that
[58:58] you will create such a hunger in their
[59:00] hearts." Listen, I pray Lord that you
[59:03] will create such a hunger in their
[59:05] hearts. Many, Lord, they're got to be
[59:07] hungry. That's why they would drive
[59:09] these hundreds of miles through ice and
[59:11] everything over rainy mountains, across
[59:14] deserts to come to a little old place
[59:16] sitting here on the corner. He said,
[59:17] "But then I think again, Lord, you said
[59:20] where the carcass is." Amen. There the
[59:22] eagles would be gathered. He said, "Feed
[59:24] us, Lord, upon thy divine mana and give
[59:28] to our souls that what we really need.
[59:31] We are thirsting for you, Father." He
[59:33] said, "Let the great Holy Spirit that
[59:35] come down on the mountain." The other
[59:37] day up there, he said, "I pray that
[59:39] he'll saturate every heart in here with
[59:42] his goodness and mercy and with
[59:44] understanding." We realize, Father,
[59:47] that's what we need is to understand.
[59:49] For if we do not know what we're doing,
[59:51] then how will we do it? But we must have
[59:54] an understanding as Daniel said,
[59:56] understanding by the prophets and our
[59:58] father. Amen. Pray we have understanding
[1:00:00] by the Holy Spirit that he will reveal
[1:00:03] it to us. Amen. In this hour, listen
[1:00:06] folks, if anybody got a right to be
[1:00:08] happy in the house of God on a Wednesday
[1:00:11] night is the bride of Jesus Christ. We
[1:00:14] are literally sitting in the fulfillment
[1:00:16] of prophecy when he desired to reveal
[1:00:19] himself, when he desired to manifest
[1:00:21] himself. But all the tables were full of
[1:00:24] vomit. Oh, but in the day when the son
[1:00:26] of man will be revealed, Jesus Christ
[1:00:29] will be preached again in the church and
[1:00:31] the preaching of the Holy Ghost will
[1:00:33] clean up the table. It'll take the
[1:00:35] flowers off the altar. It'll take the
[1:00:37] cigarettes out of the pockets. It'll
[1:00:39] take the alcohol out of the
[1:00:40] refrigerator. It'll take the televisions
[1:00:43] out of the living room. It'll take the
[1:00:44] dresses Oh, God. Can I preach? It'll
[1:00:47] take the short dresses out of the
[1:00:48] closets. It'll take the rock and roll
[1:00:50] country music. Amen. Out of the players
[1:00:53] and it'll put a desire in there. Amen.
[1:00:55] To hear the word and to agree in the
[1:00:58] word. Yes, sir. What time is it, sir? He
[1:01:01] said, "How many ever heard it?" Say,
[1:01:02] "Amen." See, what is it exactly? He
[1:01:06] said, "Then we've got the revelation."
[1:01:08] Yes, sir. Ain't that powerful? We're not
[1:01:11] looking for the revelation, brother
[1:01:13] Mark. We've got the revelation in the
[1:01:16] last days for the message of the Lord
[1:01:18] God. Amen. To gather his bride together.
[1:01:23] No other age has it been promised. But
[1:01:26] in this age, Malachi 4, Luke 17:30, John
[1:01:30] 14:12, and Joel 2:28. See, these
[1:01:34] promises is just exactly like John the
[1:01:37] Baptist identified himself in the
[1:01:40] scripture. Look here in Philippians 3:8.
[1:01:42] Paul says, "Yeah, doubtless, and I count
[1:01:44] all things, but loss for the excellency
[1:01:48] of the knowledge of Christ Jesus my
[1:01:50] Lord, for whom I have suffered the loss
[1:01:52] of all things, and do count them, but
[1:01:55] dung, that I may win Christ, and be
[1:01:58] found in him, not having my own
[1:02:01] righteousness, which is of the law, but
[1:02:03] that which is through the faith of
[1:02:05] Christ, which is the righteousness which
[1:02:07] God by faith has given to us." Look what
[1:02:10] he says in verse 10. that I may know
[1:02:13] him. Amen. That I may know him. Brother
[1:02:15] David, he didn't just want it to be
[1:02:17] exalted or or to say, "I got a better
[1:02:19] view on that than than Galia does." He
[1:02:22] said, "I want the revelation that I may
[1:02:24] know him and the power of his
[1:02:28] resurrection and the fellowship of his
[1:02:30] suffering being made conformable unto
[1:02:32] his death." I love what the prophet says
[1:02:34] in a little sermon called to see Jesus.
[1:02:37] He said, "Here he is now. In the name of
[1:02:39] the Lord Jesus Christ, I take every
[1:02:42] spirit in my control for God's glory for
[1:02:45] a manifestation of the resurrection of
[1:02:48] his son. He says, "The Holy Spirit is
[1:02:50] here. Now be reverent." Listen and know
[1:02:53] him who knows you.
[1:02:56] Oh, church. Amen. Listen. Before you
[1:02:59] went to an altar, Brother Jared, he
[1:03:01] already knew you. Before you got
[1:03:04] baptized, he already knew you. Before
[1:03:07] you heard one book or or read one book
[1:03:09] or listened to one tape, Brother David,
[1:03:11] before you sang one song or ever
[1:03:13] preached one sermon or ever give your
[1:03:15] heart to God, he already knew you. You
[1:03:18] say, "I've been waiting for this hour."
[1:03:20] No, God has been waiting for this hour.
[1:03:22] He's been waiting for another Emmas road
[1:03:25] where he can walk down the road and he
[1:03:28] can break open the word and there'll be
[1:03:30] somebody that won't stumble at it. They
[1:03:32] won't choke on it. They won't spit it
[1:03:34] out. They will agree with it and say
[1:03:36] that's nothing but the truth.
[1:03:41] Come know him who knows you. Yes, sir.
[1:03:44] Brother said the other day, Billy Paul
[1:03:46] and I was in in the restaurant just
[1:03:48] right after his conversion. He said,
[1:03:49] "Daddy, we was in a place eating and
[1:03:51] there was a song, you know, like that."
[1:03:53] He said, "Ain't that a pretty song?" I
[1:03:55] said, "What song?" He said, "Daddy, you
[1:03:58] know there's only one thing about you
[1:03:59] that's wrong." I said, "What's that,
[1:04:01] Billy?" He said, "The only thing you
[1:04:02] think about is Christ.
[1:04:05] The only thing you think about is
[1:04:07] Christ. That's all. I said, "That's a
[1:04:09] compliment, son." He said, "Yes, sir."
[1:04:12] Thought he'd get next to me. He said, "I
[1:04:14] just know him." That's all he knew,
[1:04:16] brother Morgan. I just know him. He
[1:04:19] said, "That's all I want. And to know
[1:04:21] him is life." Come on, church. To know
[1:04:24] him is life. Amen. Know these other
[1:04:27] things I don't know about. It might
[1:04:29] identify me as a smart man. Can I say
[1:04:32] what a prophet said? He said, "I don't
[1:04:34] want to be a smart man. I just want to
[1:04:36] know him." How many can testify, "I
[1:04:40] don't want to be a smart man. I don't
[1:04:41] want to be having a reputation that I
[1:04:43] know it all and I got it all figured
[1:04:45] out. Oh, I just want to know him. I want
[1:04:48] to know him." As Paul said, in the power
[1:04:50] of his resurrection that when he calls,
[1:04:52] I'll come out from among the dead.
[1:04:54] That's all. And I want him. Listen, I
[1:04:57] want my name on the right place. That's
[1:05:00] why Solomon said in Ecclesiastes 3:14,
[1:05:02] he said, "I know, amen, that whatsoever
[1:05:05] God doeth, it shall be forever." How
[1:05:08] many will agree that what God done in
[1:05:10] Luke 24 shall be forever? Yes, sir.
[1:05:12] Amen. He said, "Nothing can be put to
[1:05:15] it, or nothing can be taken away from
[1:05:17] it, and God doeth it." Listen, that men
[1:05:20] should fear before him. That which has
[1:05:23] been, somebody say, hath been. Is now,
[1:05:26] and that which is to be, hath already
[1:05:28] been. Listen folks, and God requireth.
[1:05:32] Listen, God requireth that which is
[1:05:35] past. When I looked up that word
[1:05:37] requireth, brother Matt, I thought it
[1:05:39] might have been like a law or it might
[1:05:41] have been some burden of the word. You
[1:05:42] know what it means? It means to seek. It
[1:05:45] means to desire. It means to request. It
[1:05:48] means to seek, to find. It means to seek
[1:05:52] to secure. Listen, God is requiring your
[1:05:55] fellowship. Hallelujah. Why are you here
[1:05:58] on a Wednesday night? He's requiring
[1:06:00] your fellowship. He's not begging you
[1:06:02] for your fellowship. He's not beating
[1:06:04] you on the back for your fellowship.
[1:06:06] He's desiring your fellowship. He wants
[1:06:08] to walk again with somebody who will
[1:06:11] agree with him. He wants to walk again
[1:06:13] with somebody who will love him and
[1:06:15] they'll wash his feet with their tears
[1:06:17] and they'll dry it with their hair. He's
[1:06:19] looking for somebody to break out of the
[1:06:22] bad day, to break out of the bills
[1:06:24] that's piling up, to break out of all
[1:06:26] the situations and say, "Lord, you
[1:06:28] brought me back to the Emmas road. You
[1:06:30] don't just want to open eyes. You want
[1:06:33] to open my eyes cuz you want me to know
[1:06:35] you.
[1:06:38] You want me to know you because you
[1:06:41] already know me." Amen.
[1:06:45] Hallelujah.
[1:06:46] Hallelujah. Hallelujah.
[1:06:49] You want to open my eyes. Amen. Cuz you
[1:06:53] want me to know you cuz you already know
[1:06:56] me.
[1:06:58] Oh, church. God is here tonight seeking.
[1:07:01] Thank you, Lord. If that revelation ever
[1:07:04] dropped in your heart, you'd lose all
[1:07:06] your concern about church politics. If
[1:07:08] that revelation ever dropped in your
[1:07:10] heart, you would lose all your concern
[1:07:12] about who took your parking spot, who
[1:07:14] didn't shake your hand, who didn't call
[1:07:16] on you to sing, who didn't visit you
[1:07:18] this week. If you lost that nonsense and
[1:07:20] got a real quickening power in your
[1:07:22] soul, that I'm only here because God is
[1:07:26] requiring to reveal himself to me. He's
[1:07:28] longing to move into my soul.
[1:07:33] Well, brother Andrew, there's problems
[1:07:34] at the house, but there's a problem
[1:07:36] solver in the building.
[1:07:39] Come on, church. I think it's time to
[1:07:41] take the restrictions off. I might as
[1:07:43] well preach. That devil's pushing. He
[1:07:45] got the wrong joker up here tonight.
[1:07:46] I'll push back. Amen. I will not lay
[1:07:49] down to that devil that wants to build a
[1:07:51] wall up and say, "My God cannot come
[1:07:53] into his church in the power of his
[1:07:55] resurrection because of all the problems
[1:07:57] and all the situations." I refuse, amen,
[1:08:01] to lay down the authority of the word
[1:08:03] and say, "Well, the devil can have his
[1:08:04] way. Satan can't have his way." Because
[1:08:07] while you're sitting there, amen, trying
[1:08:09] to tell God all your problems and tell
[1:08:11] God all your troubles and tell God all
[1:08:13] your situations, can I let you in on a
[1:08:15] little secret? He already knows about
[1:08:17] it. He already knows about the failures.
[1:08:20] He knows about the mistakes. He knows
[1:08:22] about the short words. He knows about
[1:08:24] the sins. He already knows all about it.
[1:08:27] But he's still here because he knows
[1:08:29] you. And he knows that if his word can
[1:08:32] strike your soul, he deposited something
[1:08:34] in there that will agree with it.
[1:08:39] Wouldn't you like to take a trip? He
[1:08:40] said, "Thank you, Lord." With Copius and
[1:08:44] them on the road to Emmas, he said, I'd
[1:08:46] like to walk with him.
[1:08:50] And it's possible. Yes, sir. Glory. I'm
[1:08:54] so glad to be living today that I can
[1:08:56] deal the still do the same thing. I can
[1:08:59] walk with him today just the same as
[1:09:03] they did then. Hallelujah. I can walk
[1:09:05] with him today. Hallelujah, brother
[1:09:08] Brian. Just the same as they did then.
[1:09:12] See, because I live, ye live also.
[1:09:15] Speaking to his wife. Listen, folks.
[1:09:18] What a resurrection that was. Come on.
[1:09:21] Can I Can I I'm sorry. This quote is
[1:09:23] just This quote's just been eating me up
[1:09:24] all day. What a resurrection that was.
[1:09:27] What a resurrection that was when he got
[1:09:30] up out of the tomb and brother Joe he
[1:09:32] walked down the Emmas road with Cleopus.
[1:09:34] Amen. But what a resurrection this is
[1:09:37] when he turned out there off the highway
[1:09:39] and he stepped down into your car and he
[1:09:41] rode down County Road 221 and he pulled
[1:09:44] into Grace Tabernacle and you've had a
[1:09:46] bad day. You've been all tore up. You've
[1:09:48] got all kinds of situations, but you
[1:09:50] said, "Lord, I'm going to go in there,
[1:09:52] but I want you to go with me. I want you
[1:09:54] to come in the service with me." and you
[1:09:56] constrained him, hey, to come into this
[1:09:59] meeting tonight. Listen, he's here. He's
[1:10:02] here. He's here to break the bread. He's
[1:10:04] here to fix the problem. He's here to
[1:10:06] forgive the sin. He's here to heal the
[1:10:09] body. Thank you, Lord.
[1:10:12] We constrained him, brother Matt. Yes,
[1:10:14] sir. We said, Lord, we want you to come
[1:10:17] in. Amen. Resurrection that was was the
[1:10:21] word's physical resurrection. But the
[1:10:23] resurrection this is is the word
[1:10:26] spiritual resurrection in bride form.
[1:10:29] Can I say what the Bible said? Spiritual
[1:10:32] resurrection has imparted spiritual
[1:10:36] knowledge and it is come into the
[1:10:40] believer. In Ephesians 2:1, "And you
[1:10:43] hath be quickened who were dead in
[1:10:45] trespasses and sins." Is it okay to read
[1:10:48] a little bit? We're in time past.
[1:10:50] Listen, ye walked. Come on. Why are you
[1:10:54] so upset about me preaching about you
[1:10:56] walk with God? You weren't upset to walk
[1:10:58] in depression all day.
[1:11:01] You weren't upset to walk in negativity
[1:11:03] all day. Won't you change your walking
[1:11:05] partners? Once you change who you're
[1:11:07] walking with, you've been walking with
[1:11:08] the problems and walking with the gossip
[1:11:11] and walking with the situation. Once you
[1:11:13] change who you're walking with, once you
[1:11:15] put on your walking shoes and walk with
[1:11:17] the resurrection for a while and let him
[1:11:20] open your eyes and let him reveal
[1:11:22] himself to
[1:11:24] walked in times past according to the
[1:11:27] prince of the power of the air. Listen.
[1:11:29] The spirit that now workketh
[1:11:33] in the children of disobedience, among
[1:11:36] whom also we all had our conversation in
[1:11:40] times past in the lust of our flesh,
[1:11:43] fulfilling the desires of the flesh and
[1:11:45] of the mind, and were by nature the
[1:11:48] children of wrath, even as
[1:11:51] others. Doesn't that sound like Luke 24?
[1:11:55] They were walking with the Easter frown.
[1:11:58] They were walking in their conversation
[1:12:00] and their communication was depression
[1:12:02] and that he was dead. But I love verse
[1:12:05] four. But God,
[1:12:08] brother Ben, but God who is rich in
[1:12:11] mercy. For his great love wherewith he
[1:12:13] loved us even when we were dead in sins.
[1:12:17] Hallelujah. Hath quickened us together
[1:12:19] with Christ. By grace ye are saved. and
[1:12:24] hath raised us up together, and made us
[1:12:27] sit together in heavenly places in
[1:12:30] Christ Jesus, that in the ages to come,
[1:12:33] that he might show the exceeding riches
[1:12:35] of his grace in his kindness towards us
[1:12:38] through Christ Jesus. For by grace are
[1:12:41] you saved through faith, and that not of
[1:12:43] yourselves, it is the gift of God. It is
[1:12:46] not of works, lest any man should boast.
[1:12:48] For we are his workmanship, created in
[1:12:51] Christ Jesus, unto good works, which God
[1:12:54] hath before ordained that we should walk
[1:12:57] in them. Listen folks, God chose a path
[1:13:01] for you to walk in, brother Carter.
[1:13:03] Before you was ever even born, God chose
[1:13:05] your path. He said, "I'll order your
[1:13:07] footsteps in the word." Re said,
[1:13:09] "Listen, now we are resurrected today.
[1:13:12] We are resurrected from the inside out,
[1:13:14] not from the outside in. See, we're not
[1:13:16] sealed out. We're sealed in. Them days
[1:13:19] when sin was the abomination before God
[1:13:21] and there was no appropriation to take
[1:13:23] it away, we were sealed away from it.
[1:13:25] But we are now raised with him in
[1:13:28] spiritual resurrection. We are sealed
[1:13:30] into the body of Christ. Can I say this
[1:13:33] to you? Eternally sealed.
[1:13:37] Well, I had a bad day. That don't change
[1:13:39] the fact you are eternally sealed. Well,
[1:13:42] I thought a bad thought. That don't
[1:13:44] change the fact you are eternally
[1:13:46] sealed. Well, I made a mistake. That
[1:13:48] don't change the fact you are eternally
[1:13:51] sealed. When a man receives the Holy
[1:13:53] Ghost on his soul, it's not from one
[1:13:56] meeting to another. It's not from one
[1:13:58] good service to another. It's until the
[1:14:00] day of your redemption.
[1:14:03] We're not sealed for a space of time,
[1:14:05] but for eternity. And now that person
[1:14:08] has received that is raised from dead
[1:14:11] from a life of sin. Listen, now we find
[1:14:14] out it's a complete work. It's a
[1:14:17] finished product. God's resurrection is
[1:14:20] a finished product. The Holy Ghost is
[1:14:23] God's seal of a finished product. Can I
[1:14:26] say something to you? This is not a
[1:14:28] double portion of emotion.
[1:14:32] This is a double portion of resurrection
[1:14:35] power. Amen. Brother Bram said, "We got
[1:14:38] eternal life, resurrection from sin now
[1:14:40] in righteousness with the Holy Ghost and
[1:14:43] then on the return with Christ. We come
[1:14:46] back both with physical resurrection cuz
[1:14:48] we already got spiritual resurrection.
[1:14:51] We have a double portion of it. Elisha
[1:14:54] and Elijah, listen, there ain't no more
[1:14:56] bother, brother. Death is nothing. We
[1:14:59] got it. It's ours. It cannot control
[1:15:01] me." We are now risen with him sitting
[1:15:05] in heavenly places in Christ Jesus. Can
[1:15:07] I say this to you? With all things under
[1:15:10] our feet.
[1:15:12] What is trying to hinder you right now
[1:15:14] should not be above you. It should be
[1:15:16] under your feet. Paul said even the
[1:15:19] physical resurrection is under our feet
[1:15:22] because we are in Christ. I love what
[1:15:25] the Bible says. That's the God of our
[1:15:27] Lord Jesus Christ, the father of glory,
[1:15:29] that he may give unto you, amen, the
[1:15:32] spirit of wisdom and revelation and the
[1:15:35] knowledge of him. Look what brother Bam
[1:15:37] says. He says, see, he just keeps
[1:15:39] revealing himself to you all the time.
[1:15:42] Amen. Growing. Somebody shout growing.
[1:15:45] Amen. Can I tell you something? You
[1:15:46] might have had a bad day, but you ought
[1:15:48] to shout back at that devil, I'm still
[1:15:50] growing.
[1:15:50] [Applause]
[1:15:53] You may feel lower than a snake's belly
[1:15:55] right now, but you ought to take your
[1:15:57] position as a child of God and look that
[1:16:00] devil's player in the face and say, "But
[1:16:02] I'm still growing, devil. I may have
[1:16:04] made mistakes. I may have made failures
[1:16:06] and shortcomings, but I'm still growing.
[1:16:09] I'm still growing." See, I'm going from
[1:16:11] grace unto grace. I'm going from power
[1:16:15] unto power. I'm going from glory unto
[1:16:17] glory. I love this. Not fall back to
[1:16:20] fall back. I'm not going from fall back
[1:16:24] to fall back. Can I say this? The time
[1:16:26] has come. Amen. To quit falling back
[1:16:28] between services.
[1:16:30] Can I preach, pastor? It's time to quit
[1:16:33] falling back between services. It's time
[1:16:35] to take what God done for you and feed
[1:16:37] that experience until it releases an
[1:16:39] authority in you. Listen, I don't think
[1:16:41] you ought to have to go back and start
[1:16:43] over from Sunday. I think you ought to
[1:16:45] take a step on Monday and take a step on
[1:16:47] Tuesday and take a step tonight and take
[1:16:49] a step tomorrow. Come on, Cleopus. Come
[1:16:52] on, Grace Tabernacle. It's time to walk
[1:16:55] with the resurrection. It's time to walk
[1:16:57] and know him.
[1:17:01] It's time to know him accurately,
[1:17:04] not haphazardly. Hallelujah. It's time
[1:17:08] to know him in the revelation of
[1:17:10] stability.
[1:17:12] Now I just got to say what a prophet
[1:17:14] said. He said knowledge precise. Look
[1:17:17] what Paul says here. And correct
[1:17:19] knowledge. It is used of the knowledge
[1:17:21] of things ethical and divine. Now watch
[1:17:24] what this knowledge of him is going to
[1:17:26] do. The eyes of your understanding is
[1:17:29] going to be enlightened that you may
[1:17:32] know what is the hope of his calling.
[1:17:35] Hallelujah. Now how many will agree
[1:17:37] there's a lot of things calling at your
[1:17:38] life? Amen. Amen. But he's calling.
[1:17:42] Hallelujah. Y'all know I grew up in the
[1:17:44] mountains of East Tennessee and they
[1:17:46] used to have a saying around there.
[1:17:47] People go down to Gatlinburg. Amen.
[1:17:49] Capital vacation spot, I guess, of the
[1:17:51] world. Go down to Gatlinburgg and they
[1:17:53] get them t-shirts. Brother Xavier, they
[1:17:55] come wearing them t-shirts around. The
[1:17:57] mountains are calling. I must go.
[1:18:02] The mountains are calling. I must go.
[1:18:05] Come on. Y'all know what I'm talking
[1:18:06] about. Amen. Some days you walk by your
[1:18:08] boat and it calls your name and you drop
[1:18:09] it. You drop everything and get on it
[1:18:12] cuz the water's calling. The fish are
[1:18:15] calling. That means there's something in
[1:18:17] that call that's got enough power to
[1:18:19] overtake you and cause you to drop what
[1:18:22] you're holding on to and go do something
[1:18:24] else. Oh, church of the living God, this
[1:18:27] Eleazar call, this resurrection call has
[1:18:30] called you. It's time to drop everything
[1:18:33] unlike it. It's time to go do something
[1:18:35] else. It's time to go from being
[1:18:37] depressed to having joy unspeakable and
[1:18:40] full of glory. It's time to go from
[1:18:42] condemnation and walk in redemption
[1:18:44] authority. It's time to lay aside the
[1:18:46] guilt and quit trying to re We ain't a
[1:18:49] bunch of Catholics, folks. We ain't
[1:18:51] paying penance on Wednesday nights.
[1:18:53] We're growing from grace under grace,
[1:18:56] from power unto power, from glory unto
[1:18:58] glory as he reveals
[1:19:01] himself. and what their riches. And
[1:19:04] y'all know somebody going to drop
[1:19:07] everything they got and go fishing or
[1:19:08] drop everything they got and go to the
[1:19:10] mountains. Somebody got to pay for that.
[1:19:15] I know it's Wednesday night. I'm home.
[1:19:16] I'm having fun.
[1:19:19] Somebody got to pay for it, brother
[1:19:20] Xavier. Somebody got to pay that bill.
[1:19:23] You say, "Brother Ed, there's no way I
[1:19:25] can drop what I'm carrying and walk with
[1:19:27] God." Well, my Bible says, "And that you
[1:19:30] might know what is the richest
[1:19:33] of his glory which is the inheritance in
[1:19:36] the saints. Look at this word know. It
[1:19:39] means to pay attention to. It means to
[1:19:41] observe, to look at, to behold, to have
[1:19:44] an interview with, to visit, has the
[1:19:47] sign significance of a present, to know,
[1:19:50] to get knowledge of, of any fact.
[1:19:53] Listen, the force and meaning of
[1:19:55] something which has definite meaning to
[1:19:57] know how to be skilled in to have regard
[1:20:00] for one to pay attention to. Amen. You
[1:20:03] said brother Andrew I don't think all
[1:20:04] these services are important. Well, God
[1:20:06] said in Ephesians for ministry in the
[1:20:08] church to bring the church to the
[1:20:11] knowledge of him. Look what Jeremiah
[1:20:13] says in Jeremiah 9:23. He says, "Thus
[1:20:16] sayaith the Lord, let not the wise man
[1:20:18] glory in his wisdom, neither let the
[1:20:21] mighty man glory in his might. Let not
[1:20:23] the rich man glory in his riches. But
[1:20:26] let him that glorieth gloryth in this,
[1:20:29] that he understandeth, and knoweth me,
[1:20:33] that I am the Lord, which exercise
[1:20:35] loving kindness, judgment, and
[1:20:37] righteousness in the earth. For in these
[1:20:39] things I delight, saith the Lord." Amen.
[1:20:42] If a man glories, brother Matt, let him
[1:20:45] glory in this that I know him.
[1:20:48] If I shout about anything, let me shout
[1:20:51] about this. I know him. If I dance about
[1:20:54] anything, let me dance about this. I
[1:20:57] know him. If I'm going to preach
[1:20:59] anything, let me preach this. I know
[1:21:01] him. If I'm going to testify, let me
[1:21:04] testify this. I know him. Oh, but let's
[1:21:07] not leave it there. Sister Jordan, he
[1:21:10] knows you and he knows me and he knows
[1:21:12] every one of
[1:21:14] you. I'm sorry, folks. I'm a rich man.
[1:21:17] I'm a rich man. The tables are full of
[1:21:20] vomit, but God brought me to the message
[1:21:22] of the hour and opened my eyes.
[1:21:28] John 7:16. I'm just plowing through some
[1:21:30] scriptures. Is that okay?
[1:21:32] Jesus answered them and said, "My
[1:21:35] doctrine is not mine,
[1:21:40] but his that sent me, and if any man
[1:21:44] will do his will, he shall know of the
[1:21:47] doctrine." Now, brother Matt, can I take
[1:21:50] some liberty? Good. Okay.
[1:21:54] Okay. I'm a little put out with people
[1:21:56] running around knocking doctrine. Come
[1:21:58] on. Little pass sick of it. Well, we
[1:22:01] don't need no doctrine. Bless God. We're
[1:22:03] just all one. I'm sorry. I'm not a part
[1:22:06] of some table full of vomit.
[1:22:10] That you want to call all one. We're not
[1:22:12] all one. The doctrine of this message is
[1:22:15] what separates us from the world.
[1:22:18] Come on, folks. God ain't walking with
[1:22:20] the Baptist. Brother David, he ain't
[1:22:22] walking with the Methodist. And get mad
[1:22:23] at him if you want to. He ain't even
[1:22:25] walking with the non-denominationals
[1:22:26] because they can't agree with the word.
[1:22:29] They can't agree with the word of God.
[1:22:31] He wants to walk with somebody that he
[1:22:33] can agree with and they won't tok out
[1:22:35] what he says on their table. But I say,
[1:22:38] "Oh God, if you got to bypass them all,
[1:22:40] come to us, Lord. We're willing to walk
[1:22:43] with you. We want to know more than just
[1:22:45] a good service. We want more than just a
[1:22:47] feeling. We want the doctrine of the
[1:22:49] word. We want the meat of the word."
[1:22:51] Amen.
[1:22:53] Whether he be of God or whether I speak
[1:22:55] of myself. Somebody say, "Well, I don't
[1:22:57] think we need doctrine." Can I say this?
[1:22:59] Doctrine is the truth. Jesus said to the
[1:23:01] Jews which believed on him, "If you
[1:23:04] continue in my word, then are ye my
[1:23:06] disciples indeed." Listen, and ye shall
[1:23:08] know the truth. Yes, sir.
[1:23:11] And the truth shall make you free. Can I
[1:23:15] say this? The truth is not a church,
[1:23:16] folks. The truth is not a preacher,
[1:23:19] Brother Joe. The truth is not an idea.
[1:23:21] The truth is a person. And Jesus said,
[1:23:24] "I am the way." Hallelujah. Yes, sir. I
[1:23:27] am the truth and I am the life. Look
[1:23:30] what he said in John 17:3. And this life
[1:23:32] eternal that they might know thee, the
[1:23:36] only true God and Jesus Christ, whom
[1:23:39] thou hast sent. Listen in Colossians
[1:23:42] 1:10, Paul said that you might walk
[1:23:45] worthy of the Lord unto all pleasing,
[1:23:48] being fruitful in every good work. Look,
[1:23:51] and increasing in the knowledge of God.
[1:23:54] Hallelujah. Somebody say, "Well, I'm
[1:23:57] just in the message." I say it's time to
[1:23:58] walk. It's time to walk in the
[1:24:01] revelation of the resurrection. It's
[1:24:03] time to walk with these books. It's time
[1:24:05] to walk with these tapes. And I'm just
[1:24:07] going to get it out there and say it. Is
[1:24:08] that okay? I refuse to lay off of that.
[1:24:13] Because I happen to know that's the only
[1:24:15] way to walk into a resurrection.
[1:24:17] Hallelujah.
[1:24:19] Amen. You said, "Brother, what are you
[1:24:20] talking about? Increasing in the
[1:24:23] knowledge of God." Roman said, "Listen,
[1:24:24] I want you to get this that before this
[1:24:26] certain thing called the new birth ever
[1:24:27] happens to the man, he cannot know, he
[1:24:30] can no way at all understand or ever
[1:24:32] understand God or have any knowledge of
[1:24:34] God. Though the word speaks it, his mind
[1:24:37] cannot comprehend it. Listen, because
[1:24:40] it's a human mind, he's got to have the
[1:24:43] mind of God in him to understand godly
[1:24:47] things. He said when a man experiences
[1:24:50] the depth of God in his life, it is an
[1:24:53] actual personal experience
[1:24:57] of the spirit of God indwelling him and
[1:25:01] his mind is illuminated by the wisdom
[1:25:04] and the knowledge of God through the
[1:25:07] word. Look what Solomon said in Proverbs
[1:25:10] 2:5. Is everybody okay? Then thou shalt
[1:25:13] understand the fear of the Lord. Listen
[1:25:15] and find the knowledge of God. For the
[1:25:18] Lord giveth wisdom out of his mouth,
[1:25:20] cometh knowledge and understanding. He
[1:25:22] layeth up sound wisdom for the
[1:25:24] righteous. Yes, sir. Oh, God. Ain't that
[1:25:27] powerful? He layeth up sound wisdom for
[1:25:30] the righteous. Listen, he is a buckler
[1:25:33] to them that walk uprightly.
[1:25:36] Can I say this to you? If you walk with
[1:25:38] him, you won't have to fight your
[1:25:40] battles. He'll fight them for
[1:25:42] you. If you walk with him, you won't
[1:25:45] have to worry about things to say. He'll
[1:25:47] give you the words to say. He keepeth
[1:25:49] the paths of judgment. Are you ready for
[1:25:51] this? And he preserveth the way of his
[1:25:55] saints.
[1:25:58] Brother Bobby, he preserves the way you
[1:26:00] walk in. Look what the Bible said in 2
[1:26:02] Peter 1:2. Grace and peace be multiplied
[1:26:05] unto you. How's it going to come?
[1:26:07] Through the knowledge,
[1:26:09] hallelujah, of God and of our Lord
[1:26:12] Jesus. according as his divine power
[1:26:15] hath given unto us all things that
[1:26:18] pertain unto life and godliness through
[1:26:20] the knowledge of him that hath called us
[1:26:22] to glory and virtue. Listen, whereby are
[1:26:25] given unto us, amen, exceeding great and
[1:26:30] precious promises, that by these ye
[1:26:33] might be the partakers of the divine
[1:26:36] nature. Hallelujah. Now, can I read the
[1:26:38] rest of it? Having escaped the
[1:26:42] corruption that is in the world through
[1:26:44] lust. That's right. Come on. Can I tell
[1:26:48] you why the devil hates you? You got
[1:26:50] away. Amen.
[1:26:53] You got away. The devil hates you
[1:26:57] because you got away. The devil hates
[1:27:00] Cleopus because he got away. The devil
[1:27:03] hates Paul because he got away. The
[1:27:06] devil hates grace tabernacle because we
[1:27:08] got away. How do we get away? Through
[1:27:10] the knowledge of our Lord Jesus Christ.
[1:27:13] Grace and peace has been multiplied unto
[1:27:16] us.
[1:27:18] You say, well, when you see that
[1:27:20] scripture is not contradictory. The
[1:27:22] knowledge of God can reveal it. Now, he
[1:27:24] says, notice you are now on your way.
[1:27:27] You are growing to the full
[1:27:30] resurrection. Can I say this to you? No
[1:27:32] tree just comes up overnight. It's got
[1:27:35] to grow. And as we grow in the grace and
[1:27:39] the knowledge of God, you are baptized
[1:27:42] into the Holy Spirit. Listen now, as the
[1:27:45] Pentecostal church baptized in the Holy
[1:27:48] Spirit, it's begin growing. Limbs has
[1:27:50] died. They was pruning them off. But the
[1:27:53] tree is still growing. It's still going
[1:27:56] on because it's got to come to the
[1:28:00] resurrection. Can I say this to you?
[1:28:03] It's time to cast down imaginations.
[1:28:07] It's time to bring every high thing that
[1:28:09] exaltth itself against the knowledge of
[1:28:11] God and bring it into captivity, every
[1:28:15] thought to the obedience of Christ.
[1:28:19] Now church, can I say this to you? It is
[1:28:23] past time to stop walking up to your
[1:28:26] enemy presuming. Amen.
[1:28:30] The Bible says that Israel presumed they
[1:28:33] would go up on top of the hill. Listen.
[1:28:36] And the prophet of God said they got
[1:28:37] whipped because they was presuming. He
[1:28:40] said, "Now listen, what happens is
[1:28:42] Israel presumed that because God had
[1:28:45] been good, so good, he would just go on
[1:28:47] being good." He said, "See, but the
[1:28:49] problem was they were all together out
[1:28:51] of the will of God." But now look, God
[1:28:55] does not presume. Amen. Can I say what
[1:28:58] Paul says? He said, "Our God is a
[1:29:01] consuming fire." See, you say you're a
[1:29:04] believer, you don't have to presume
[1:29:06] anything. It's God consuming you. You
[1:29:09] don't have to presume. See, it's
[1:29:11] consuming. And you are God's sacrifice.
[1:29:14] As they walked with him on the road to
[1:29:17] Emmas, their hearts were consumed by the
[1:29:20] revelation. Brother David, it becomes so
[1:29:23] real to them. The Bible says that they
[1:29:26] actually went on and they went on
[1:29:28] fellowship with him. Now look here in
[1:29:30] Matthew 17. The Bible goes on to Mount
[1:29:33] Transfiguration. Look here what it says.
[1:29:35] It says there's many voices in the world
[1:29:37] today. There's many things going on,
[1:29:39] many doctrines, many isms. But hear ye
[1:29:41] him. He's the one final voice of
[1:29:45] authority. Hallelujah. He's the one
[1:29:48] that'll speak. I love what the prophet
[1:29:51] God said. He said, "See, this angel of
[1:29:53] light, this messenger of Malachi 4 is
[1:29:56] calling you out to walk with him in
[1:29:59] authority." Can I say something to you
[1:30:01] tonight? You shall know him. Yes, sir.
[1:30:04] Precisely. You shall know him
[1:30:07] accurately. I'll say this. Thank God
[1:30:10] we're not baptizing haphazardly.
[1:30:13] Thank God we're not taking communion
[1:30:16] haphazardly. Thank God we have come out
[1:30:18] of her, my people. We have received the
[1:30:21] voice and the authority of God has been
[1:30:24] revealed in his church. You say,
[1:30:27] "Preacher, what are you saying?" I'm
[1:30:29] saying this. You got a supreme faith in
[1:30:32] the truth being the truth. Then you need
[1:30:34] a supreme God that made a supreme
[1:30:36] promise and a supreme result will come.
[1:30:38] Rebraham said this. He says, "Look in
[1:30:40] Revelation 10. I hope this okay. I'm
[1:30:42] going somewhere." He said, "I saw
[1:30:44] another mighty angel come down from
[1:30:47] heaven.
[1:30:49] He was clothed with a cloud and a
[1:30:51] rainbow was up on his head and his face
[1:30:53] as it were the sun and his feet is
[1:30:55] pillars of fire. Remember said see I
[1:30:58] just described to you that old English
[1:31:00] judge. He said there's that wig. It's
[1:31:03] the supreme authority. He said now
[1:31:06] listen if you'll turn the picture you
[1:31:08] will see he is supreme judge. Supreme
[1:31:12] authority has brought supreme knowledge
[1:31:15] into the church. It is a perfect
[1:31:18] identification again that the message is
[1:31:20] the truth in the light of his
[1:31:23] resurrection. We still go forth in his
[1:31:27] name. Can I say something to you? We're
[1:31:29] not following emotions. Emotions is not
[1:31:33] supreme authority. We're following
[1:31:35] vindicated word. Remember said, see, he
[1:31:37] said if Moses would have followed the
[1:31:39] emotions of the people, they'd have been
[1:31:40] running all over the mountains screaming
[1:31:42] and Pharaoh's army would have got them.
[1:31:44] But they followed instructions. See, and
[1:31:46] let me say this. Rebraham said, "God
[1:31:48] gives us instructions on whether to know
[1:31:51] whether we don't have to presume
[1:31:53] anything or nothing." Listen, you can
[1:31:55] have an experience to know him.
[1:31:59] Can I close on this? You don't have to
[1:32:02] live another day guessing. You don't
[1:32:04] have to live another day looking for
[1:32:07] something to feed your souls.
[1:32:09] [Applause]
[1:32:12] You don't have to go another second
[1:32:14] looking for something to draw strength
[1:32:16] from. Supreme authority is here. Chief
[1:32:19] authority is here.
[1:32:22] Come on. You said, "Brother Andrew, why
[1:32:23] are you so big on those tapes?" Cuz I
[1:32:25] know that's the only thing that'll feed
[1:32:27] a revival in a soul of a young person.
[1:32:31] You said, "Brother Andrew, Amen. There,
[1:32:33] that's just a waste of time." No, it's
[1:32:34] not. Amen. You don't know what joy it
[1:32:36] does my heart when one of these young
[1:32:38] brothers texts me and says, "What tape
[1:32:40] do you recommend we listen to?"
[1:32:43] I know people think that's a shame. It's
[1:32:46] not a shame because they're walking as
[1:32:48] authority. There was a pastor called me
[1:32:50] the other day. He said, "But Andrew," he
[1:32:52] said, "I want to say this. Thank you for
[1:32:53] preaching the message." He said, "My
[1:32:55] young kids come home from a meeting and
[1:32:57] said they were coming to me asking me
[1:32:59] about what tapes to listen to." He said,
[1:33:01] "Because you so instilled the fact that
[1:33:04] those tapes are authority." Well, can I
[1:33:06] say this? Because I'm walking in the
[1:33:09] revelation, I know him.
[1:33:14] You know him. Let me say this. We're not
[1:33:17] blind.
[1:33:19] We're not blind. You know what the Bible
[1:33:21] says? The Bible says, "The blind
[1:33:25] lead the blind and they all fall into a
[1:33:29] ditch.
[1:33:31] It's kind of like something I've always
[1:33:32] wondered about. Jonah is going to an eye
[1:33:33] doctor who wears glasses
[1:33:36] himself. The blind leads the blind and
[1:33:40] they all fall in a ditch. Come on,
[1:33:43] church. You know what the Bible says?
[1:33:45] The Bible says this. It said John was
[1:33:48] going to introduce to the world who the
[1:33:50] Messiah was. Now, John didn't stand
[1:33:52] there and say, "I presume here he is."
[1:33:56] He said, "No, oh God, that's it." He
[1:33:59] said he didn't presume nothing. He knew
[1:34:02] he was the son of God. He knowed he was
[1:34:06] the lamb that was taken away the sin of
[1:34:09] the world because it was revealed to
[1:34:12] him.
[1:34:15] Look at the woman at the well. I I love
[1:34:16] this one. The woman at the well.
[1:34:18] Everybody knows the woman at the well.
[1:34:20] bad reputation,
[1:34:24] bad back life, bad history, unrecognized
[1:34:28] in society. But can I tell you
[1:34:30] something? She knew him.
[1:34:36] Can I tell you something? And he knew
[1:34:38] her.
[1:34:41] Hallelujah. He knew her before she knew
[1:34:44] him. Hallelujah. When she walked to the
[1:34:48] well, he didn't say who you are. He
[1:34:50] said, "You got five husbands and the one
[1:34:53] you're living with is not yours." And
[1:34:55] you know what she said? She said, "I
[1:34:57] guess you're the Messiah." She said, "I
[1:34:59] guess you're the one that's to come. I
[1:35:01] guess you're the one that's going to
[1:35:03] reveal these things." No, sir. She
[1:35:05] looked him in the face and she said, "I
[1:35:07] know.
[1:35:10] I know. I know that when Messiah cometh,
[1:35:13] he will do these things." Can I say this
[1:35:15] to you? And Daniel said, "The people
[1:35:18] that know their God shall be strong and
[1:35:21] do great exploits." You know what the
[1:35:23] Bible said? The Bible said she dropped.
[1:35:25] Oh, God. Hallelujah. She threw it away.
[1:35:30] Reality was calling her. The
[1:35:33] resurrection was calling her. A new life
[1:35:36] was calling her. Hallelujah. A new Oh,
[1:35:39] God. A new headship was calling her. And
[1:35:42] she threw away the water bucket. Amen.
[1:35:46] Hallelujah. Oh, church. Can I say it to
[1:35:49] you tonight?
[1:35:51] Come on. Hallelujah. I know it's
[1:35:54] Wednesday. I'm trying to behave myself.
[1:35:56] The mountains ain't calling, but reality
[1:35:59] is.
[1:36:00] [Applause]
[1:36:02] Vacation ain't calling, but the way, the
[1:36:05] truth, and the life is. I'm sorry. I
[1:36:08] can't carry it no more. Jared, I got to
[1:36:10] let it go. I got to respond to the call.
[1:36:14] Hallelujah.
[1:36:16] She dropped her water bucket
[1:36:21] because she looked upon him whose
[1:36:25] presence she was in. Hallelujah. And the
[1:36:27] quickening power quickened the seed.
[1:36:30] Hallelujah. In her soul.
[1:36:34] Oh God.
[1:36:36] Quickening power. Hallelujah.
[1:36:39] It quickened a seed in her soul. And she
[1:36:42] didn't stand there and guess.
[1:36:44] Hallelujah. She didn't stand there and
[1:36:46] agree. She didn't stand there and
[1:36:49] disagree and say, "Are you the one?" Let
[1:36:51] me ask you this question. How did you
[1:36:53] know that? No. She agreed with it.
[1:36:58] Come on, folks. I'm going to close on
[1:36:59] this, but I'm going to knock that devil
[1:37:00] square in the face, and you can sit
[1:37:02] there and watch me. Amen. I'll say it to
[1:37:04] you like this. It's time to quit
[1:37:05] agreeing with things that's condemning
[1:37:07] you. It's time to quit agreeing with
[1:37:09] them. It's time to agree with the word.
[1:37:12] You say, "Brother Andrew, how did she
[1:37:14] get out of that condition? By simply
[1:37:16] agreeing."
[1:37:18] When she simply agreed with the word.
[1:37:21] Hallelujah. When she simply agreed with
[1:37:23] the word, she walked out of the life of
[1:37:26] prostitution and she become a
[1:37:30] David Paul. She become a woman whose
[1:37:32] name is immortal tonight because she
[1:37:35] simply agreed with the resurrected Lord.
[1:37:41] She agreed with the word.
[1:37:44] Hallelujah. Can I say something to you
[1:37:46] tonight? You can walk out of it.
[1:37:50] Come on, folks. I'm going to say this
[1:37:52] under the leadership of the Holy Ghost
[1:37:53] right now. It was not a mistake that
[1:37:56] Matt Moore sang that. He saved you. He
[1:37:58] saved your kids. He saved your kids. He
[1:38:01] saved your parents. Was not a mistake,
[1:38:03] Matt. Brother Matt. Sorry. It was not a
[1:38:06] mistake. It was the Lord. Cuz I tell you
[1:38:09] this, you know how Hatty Wright's two
[1:38:11] boys come to God?
[1:38:15] Do you know how Hatty Wright's two boys
[1:38:18] came back to God? Because she agreed
[1:38:21] with one who had been walking with the
[1:38:24] resurrection. Hallelujah. She had been
[1:38:27] walking. He had been
[1:38:32] walking with the resurrection. He had
[1:38:35] been walking with Mark 11. He had been
[1:38:37] walking with Jesus. He was up there in
[1:38:39] the mountains and he said, "Let there be
[1:38:41] squirrels."
[1:38:43] Let there be squirrels.
[1:38:45] Sister Tammy, there were squirrels.
[1:38:48] There were squirrels right there. And he
[1:38:50] walked Oh, God. He walked into Charlie
[1:38:53] Cox's house with the revelation in his
[1:38:56] soul.
[1:39:00] That Mark 11 is still in effect.
[1:39:06] and he
[1:39:08] rehearsed I'm just I'm calming down here
[1:39:10] Wednesday night.
[1:39:13] And he rehearsed his
[1:39:17] conversation with the resurrection.
[1:39:21] Listen folks, you may not believe it,
[1:39:23] but I've seen it.
[1:39:25] Brother Morgan, I was preaching at
[1:39:28] brother Sean's one Sunday. I was
[1:39:29] preaching on the third pull power, and
[1:39:31] there was a man there. He told me, he
[1:39:33] said, "Brother Andrew," he said, "I'm
[1:39:35] gonna bring something tonight." He said,
[1:39:36] "If you're preaching the third pull," he
[1:39:39] said, "I know you're headed to the
[1:39:41] Charlie Cox's house where Hattie Wright
[1:39:43] got her two boys." I said, "Brother,
[1:39:45] that's where I'm headed." He said, "I'm
[1:39:46] going to bring something tonight." And
[1:39:48] brother Morgan, I walked in there to
[1:39:49] preach and in front of the pull pit was
[1:39:52] a table. You know what he told me? He
[1:39:54] said, "But Andrew," he said, "that
[1:39:56] little mark right there on that corner."
[1:39:58] He said, "Charlie Cox gave me that
[1:40:00] table." He said that was the table that
[1:40:03] brother Brandham walked in there and
[1:40:05] laid them seven created squirrels on.
[1:40:12] Listen folks, I don't have the table
[1:40:14] here tonight.
[1:40:16] Come on. I don't have the table here,
[1:40:19] but brother Jared, the God that done it
[1:40:21] back there,
[1:40:23] [Music]
[1:40:24] the God that done it back there is right
[1:40:27] here tonight. He requireth the things
[1:40:30] which has been done. Brother Matt, he's
[1:40:32] looking for somewhere. He's seeking
[1:40:34] somewhere he can do it again. Oh God.
[1:40:38] Hallelujah. He's seeking somewhere he
[1:40:41] can do it again. I say right here on
[1:40:43] County Road 221. Do it again, Lord.
[1:40:47] Reveal yourself again, Lord.
[1:40:51] And I'll say this, Brother Bobby. We'll
[1:40:53] agree with it. Won't you stand to your
[1:40:55] feet and say, "Amen tonight." Amen.
[1:40:58] Yes, sir. As our musicians come, the
[1:41:02] people that know their God, that have a
[1:41:06] knowledge of him,
[1:41:08] their eyes have come open, their hearts
[1:41:12] has been set on fire. Hallelujah.
[1:41:17] Brother Mark, it's burning.
[1:41:20] I've been consumed.
[1:41:23] Hallelujah. I'm sorry. I'm an addict,
[1:41:25] Brother David. I can't get enough of it.
[1:41:29] It's consumed me.
[1:41:32] I'm sorry. Can y'all forgive me? Okay.
[1:41:34] Please, please forgive me. But I don't
[1:41:37] know how to give up.
[1:41:40] You say, "How can you say that, brother
[1:41:42] David Paul?" Because I've tried and it
[1:41:44] didn't work.
[1:41:46] [Applause]
[1:41:48] I've tried, Brother David, to give up
[1:41:49] and it didn't work. You know why? Cuz I
[1:41:52] didn't start myself.
[1:41:56] I didn't consume myself. Something
[1:41:59] greater than me did.
[1:42:02] It's become the force of my life.
[1:42:07] Brother David, our eyes are open.
[1:42:12] Glory to God. Our eyes are open, church.
[1:42:17] We know him.
[1:42:20] Tell you why the devil hates you. He
[1:42:22] wanted you to stay blind. Amen.
[1:42:26] Brother David, he wanted you to stay
[1:42:27] blind. He wanted you to stay blind to
[1:42:30] the calling that God has. Brother Matt,
[1:42:32] he want that devil wanted you to stay
[1:42:34] blind to the richness richness of the
[1:42:37] glory of Jesus Christ and the power of
[1:42:39] his salvation. Brother Carter, the devil
[1:42:41] wants you to stay blind to the fact God
[1:42:42] is a healer. The devil wants you to stay
[1:42:45] blind to the fact that God is a brother
[1:42:47] Kobe. The devil wants you to stay blind
[1:42:49] to the fact that greater is he that's in
[1:42:51] you than he that's in the world. But can
[1:42:53] I say this? The only reason he wants us
[1:42:55] to stay blind is because a blind
[1:42:57] person's easier to control.
[1:43:02] No offense, but somebody's blind or
[1:43:04] easier to control. You can tell them
[1:43:06] what you want them to know because Oh,
[1:43:09] God. Because they have no ability to see
[1:43:12] for themselves.
[1:43:16] The sun is red. The sun is
[1:43:18] red. The grass is pink. The grass is
[1:43:20] pink. There's three gods. There's three
[1:43:23] gods. You're saved one day and lost the
[1:43:25] next. I'm saved one day and lost the
[1:43:27] next.
[1:43:29] Holy Ghost is speaking in tong. Holy
[1:43:31] Ghost is speaking. Because they're
[1:43:33] blind, they can't see for themselves.
[1:43:36] But I want to tell that devil, I got my
[1:43:38] own Holy Ghost. I got my own books and
[1:43:41] tapes. I got the message of the hour.
[1:43:43] You can't control me no longer. I can
[1:43:45] see for myself.
[1:43:48] I don't need somebody to tell me my
[1:43:49] name's on the lamb's book of life. I see
[1:43:51] my name on the lamb's book of life. I
[1:43:54] don't need somebody to prophesy over me
[1:43:56] and tell me I got a future. I see my
[1:43:58] future by the preaching of the knowledge
[1:44:01] of God.
[1:44:04] Hallelujah. I'm not blind. I know him.
[1:44:08] And he knows me.
[1:44:13] [Music]
[1:44:14] Glory. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. I know
[1:44:17] him.
[1:44:20] [Music]
[1:44:23] If you're blind, Brother Joe, somebody
[1:44:24] tell you you're a failure. I'm a
[1:44:26] failure.
[1:44:28] Brother Joe, Brother Joe. Brother Joe,
[1:44:31] if you're blind, somebody tell you ain't
[1:44:33] going to get a blessing. I ain't going
[1:44:34] to get a blessing.
[1:44:38] But it's too late. I've already seen the
[1:44:41] value of a blessing.
[1:44:46] I've seen it, Brother David. Hallelujah.
[1:44:50] I know him.
[1:44:52] Pillar of fire ain't real. Okay, I'm
[1:44:54] blind. The pillar of fire ain't real.
[1:44:56] But too late. I've already saw it.
[1:45:00] Back off the message. It don't work. Too
[1:45:02] late. I've already seen it work.
[1:45:06] Can I say this to you? Grace Tabernacle
[1:45:08] is not blind.
[1:45:14] Trust somebody's ought to shout the
[1:45:16] medal off. We'll get him to put it back
[1:45:18] on. Brother Joe, we ain't blind. We
[1:45:21] ain't blind. Anybody got a right toe
[1:45:23] shout tonight? Is the bride of Jesus
[1:45:25] Christ? We ain't blind. We have seen our
[1:45:28] names. We have seen the revelation. We
[1:45:31] have seen the appearing of the Lord. We
[1:45:33] have seen the manifestation of his
[1:45:35] resurrection.
[1:45:38] Can't control our praise no more.
[1:45:42] Hallelujah. You can't control my praise
[1:45:44] no more. I've already seen my name in
[1:45:48] the lamb's black eyes. You can't control
[1:45:51] my dance no more. I've already seen it.
[1:45:56] I've already seen it.
[1:45:59] Stop me now. It's in my heart.
[1:46:04] Thank you, Lord. It's in my heart. God
[1:46:07] bless you tonight.
[1:46:11] [Music]
[1:46:14] I see him.
[1:46:21] Next time you read Luke 24, read the
[1:46:24] updated version. Okay,
[1:46:27] brother Connor, don't read it like this.

[1:54:15] for. Lord, my Bible says you prayed. You
[1:54:19] prayed for your children from before the
[1:54:21] foundation of the world. Lord, this is
[1:54:23] what you was praying for. Father, this
[1:54:26] is what you were seeking for. Lord, this
[1:54:28] is what you was longing for. Lord, I
[1:54:30] walk around in it tonight, Lord. It's
[1:54:33] what you were wanting, Father. You were
[1:54:35] wanting somewhere you could come and

[1:54:47] on the table. There would be no
[1:54:49] denominational agendas on the
[1:54:51] table. But Lord, there would be souls on
[1:54:54] the table. There would be believers on
[1:54:56] the table that you could come and
[1:54:58] consume with your revealing. And Lord,
[1:55:02] they would agree with
[1:55:03] you. They would agree with you, Lord.
[1:55:06] Everything you said to them They would
[1:55:09] say,
[1:55:10] "Amen." Everything you revealed to them
[1:55:12] and showed them, they would agree with
[1:55:15] it.

[1:55:35] little room

[1:56:11] I love
[1:56:16] him.
[1:56:19] I love

[1:56:53] Calvary. I'm not a singer, but the Lord
[1:56:55] gave this to me today studying.
[1:56:59] Oh,
[1:57:01] I know him. Amen. Oh,
[1:57:08] I know
[1:57:10] him
[1:57:13] because he first
[1:57:17] knew
[1:57:22] me and
[1:57:25] placed a seed.
[1:57:28] down
[1:57:30] in my
[1:57:33] soul. Oh,
[1:57:36] I Yes,

[1:57:41] him. I'm sorry. I got to sing it
[1:57:44] again. Oh,
[1:57:46] I Anybody testify with me tonight?
[1:57:49] Brother Morgan, I know
[1:57:51] him.
[1:57:53] I know him. Come on, brother Matt. You
[1:57:56] can do more with it than I can.
[1:57:59] All he
[1:58:01] first Hallelujah.
[1:58:05] [Music]
[1:58:07] Hallelujah. And
[1:58:10] purchased
[1:58:13] my
[1:58:14] [Music]
[1:58:17] redemption on
[1:58:20] [Music]
[1:58:24] Cal tree.
[1:58:27] Brother B, won't you sing that for me? I
[1:58:29] know him. Can you let the Lord use you?
[1:58:33] I know the anointing rest on him to get
[1:58:36] in that inspiration.
[1:58:39] God bless you, friends. Know him who
[1:58:42] knows you.
[1:58:44] He
[1:58:46] first knew
[1:58:51] me and he
[1:58:55] placed a
[1:58:59] se in my
[1:59:03] soul. Therefore
[1:59:05] I I
[1:59:09] know him.
[1:59:14] I said
[1:59:17] I know
[1:59:20] him.
[1:59:22] I know
[1:59:25] him just
[1:59:28] because he
[1:59:31] first knew me.
[1:59:37] And he
[1:59:39] placed this
[1:59:42] sea down
[1:59:44] in my
[1:59:47] soul so that
[1:59:50] I
[1:59:53] might
[1:59:58] know. For I know
[2:00:01] Jesus
[2:00:03] is the
[2:00:05] sweetest
[2:00:06] name I
[2:00:09] [Music]
[2:00:12] know. Oh, I say
[2:00:16] and he's just the
[2:00:21] same as his
[2:00:24] holy name.
[2:00:28] Oh, and
[2:00:29] that's the
[2:00:31] reason
[2:00:33] why I love him
[2:00:41] so. Oh, for
[2:00:44] Jesus
[2:00:45] is the
[2:00:47] sweetest name I
[2:00:53] know. Amen. How many know him in a
[2:00:56] personal way? Isn't that tremendous? I
[2:01:00] know him because he first knew me. Isn't
[2:01:03] Isn't it wonderful to know God? How many
[2:01:05] walk with him tonight?
[2:01:08] Amen. I think it's tremendous to be able
[2:01:10] to walk with God. You know, you know, I
[2:01:12] got to thinking brother Andrew was
[2:01:14] preaching that and how that how that
[2:01:16] they when that Jesus walked down to that
[2:01:20] man that was lame for 38 years and he
[2:01:24] walked past all of those people, but he
[2:01:26] came to where he was. I thought, isn't
[2:01:28] that something? He said, he bypassed
[2:01:30] them all, but he came to me. So, Lord,
[2:01:32] how grateful that he was whenever any
[2:01:34] doctor could have came by and gave him a
[2:01:36] way to cope with his condition or cope
[2:01:39] with his sickness. But when Jesus came
[2:01:41] by, he just made him whole again. I
[2:01:44] thought, my, no wonder he rejoiced. He
[2:01:46] said, you passed by all of them and you
[2:01:48] found me in my calamity and you lifted
[2:01:50] me up. You gave me the strength to walk
[2:01:52] again. All of those around me, still
[2:01:54] things going on in their life, but you
[2:01:56] came to me. Don't that make you want to
[2:01:57] worship God? It wasn't something you
[2:02:00] done. He just came to you, Brother
[2:02:01] David. saw me in my situation and he
[2:02:03] came to me and he lifted me out of it
[2:02:05] and gave me the strength to walk and
[2:02:07] healing for my body and restored me back
[2:02:10] to what I was in the beginning. Isn't
[2:02:12] that wonderful? Don't that make you want
[2:02:13] to war? Won't you just give him a hand
[2:02:14] clap of praise tonight? Isn't he
[2:02:17] wonderful? Amen. He said when you agree
[2:02:21] with the word, it changed your
[2:02:23] identification.
[2:02:25] It changed how everybody looked at that
[2:02:27] man. He could have sat there and he
[2:02:29] said, "Take up thy bed and walk." That
[2:02:31] man could have sat right where he was
[2:02:32] and said, "No, heal him won't ever come
[2:02:35] to my body. I've always had this bit.
[2:02:37] I've been in this way my whole life."
[2:02:39] But he didn't say none of that. You know
[2:02:40] what he did, Brother Travis? The
[2:02:43] weakness of his knees and the frailness
[2:02:46] of his body, it started shaking
[2:02:48] underneath him as he reached up and
[2:02:52] grabbed everything, all the strength
[2:02:53] that he could muster and done all that
[2:02:55] he could to stand to his feet. And even
[2:02:58] when those that would look around him
[2:02:59] and say, "How's he ever going to make
[2:03:00] it? How's he going to walk upright? How
[2:03:02] is he going to have the strength to
[2:03:03] stand when he does get up? And if he
[2:03:04] does stand, how can he ever take a step?
[2:03:07] But he didn't think about none of it. He
[2:03:09] obeyed the Lord and he agreed with the
[2:03:11] word and it changed his identification.
[2:03:14] No longer was he just a sitter. No
[2:03:17] longer was he a beggar, but now he was a
[2:03:19] walker that followed Jesus. I don't know
[2:03:21] about you tonight, but that's what I
[2:03:23] want to be. Amen. Lord, I ain't trying
[2:03:24] to lead myself anyway. Just let me be a
[2:03:26] walker that'll follow you. Wherever you
[2:03:29] lead me, Lord, I'll follow. Amen. Isn't
[2:03:31] that the desire of our heart tonight?
[2:03:33] How many enjoyed that message tonight?
[2:03:35] Amen. What a tremendous blessing to know
[2:03:37] God and for God to know you. Amen. Do
[2:03:41] you love the Lord tonight? Amen. Can we
[2:03:44] sing that? He'll do it again just before
[2:03:46] we go. Amen.
[2:03:49] Well, you may be
[2:03:52] down and feel like God has somehow
[2:04:01] [Music]
[2:04:04] forgotten. With
[2:04:07] circumstance, you can't get through.
[2:04:13] Right now it seems there's no way
[2:04:18] out. We're going
[2:04:24] under. But God's proven
[2:04:27] time and time
[2:04:29] again he'll take care of
[2:04:35] you. He'll do it
[2:04:38] again for you. He will do it
[2:04:46] again. Just take a
[2:04:49] look where you are
[2:04:52] now and where you've
[2:04:57] been. He'll always come through for you.
[2:05:04] He's the same now as
[2:05:06] [Music]
[2:05:09] me. You may not know how. You may not
[2:05:13] know when he'll do it
[2:05:20] again. God knows the things you're going
[2:05:26] through. He knows when you're hurting.
[2:05:32] He
[2:05:34] understands just when your heart is
[2:05:38] broken in
[2:05:42] two. Oh, he's the God of the
[2:05:46] stars, the sun and the sea. He is your
[2:05:53] father. and he'll calm the storm and
[2:05:57] he'll find a way to fix it for
[2:06:04] you. He'll do it
[2:06:08] again for you. He will do it
[2:06:13] [Music]
[2:06:15] again. Just take a look at where you are
[2:06:21] now and where you've been.
[2:06:27] He'll always come through for you. He's
[2:06:32] the same
[2:06:34] now as he was back then. You may not
[2:06:39] know how. You may not know when, but
[2:06:43] he'll do it
[2:06:50] again. Amen.
[2:06:53] He's not just the God of the past, is
[2:06:54] he? Amen. How many's looking forward to
[2:06:57] God just to continue to work in your
[2:06:59] life? How many says, "I'm still
[2:07:01] growing." Isn't that the truth? I'm
[2:07:02] still growing. Don't matter how old we
[2:07:04] get. I love you, brother Ben. He just
[2:07:06] raised both hands. I'm still growing.
[2:07:08] Amen. Amen. I I just love the Lord.
[2:07:11] Amen. Do you love one another? Amen.
[2:07:13] Amen. None of y'all love your pastor
[2:07:15] because none of you go to church on
[2:07:16] Sunday night, but we love each other
[2:07:19] anyway. Amen. I like we don't even have
[2:07:21] church on Sunday night. We do too.
[2:07:24] Anybody that says that don't even know
[2:07:25] us. We We have church all day on Sunday
[2:07:27] and a little bit on Monday and some on
[2:07:29] Tuesday and whole bunch on Wednesday and
[2:07:31] a little on Thursday and Friday. It's
[2:07:33] just something that's in our heart.
[2:07:34] That's just who we are. Amen. We don't
[2:07:36] come to church to have church. We are
[2:07:38] the church. Amen. Amen. I don't know. I
[2:07:41] don't know about everybody else, but
[2:07:42] that's just who we are. A identification
[2:07:44] has been changed. We're the church of
[2:07:46] the living God, the bride of Jesus
[2:07:48] Christ. And everywhere you go, you're
[2:07:50] still the bride. You believe that
[2:07:51] tonight? Amen. I just enjoyed that. What
[2:07:54] a wonderful spirit. Such a liberty. The
[2:07:57] Lord's doing so much for us. Amen. We're
[2:07:59] looking forward to getting to work on
[2:08:01] our building and we'll have a meeting
[2:08:03] here in a few days to kind of discuss
[2:08:05] that and and Lord's made some
[2:08:08] opportunity for us. I don't think that
[2:08:10] God's ever given us a vision or a desire
[2:08:12] on our heart that he didn't provide a
[2:08:14] way to do it. So, uh, we just want to
[2:08:16] thank the Lord for everything that he's
[2:08:17] doing for us. and just always a
[2:08:20] tremendous blessing to know that God's
[2:08:22] on your side. Amen. When it seems like
[2:08:25] you can't make it another day, but we
[2:08:26] got God on our side. Amen. Amen. I just
[2:08:29] I just enjoyed that message tonight. And
[2:08:32] just uh as a prayer request, let me just
[2:08:36] wait just a moment. I I want to remind
[2:08:38] everybody um our we have a youth trip on
[2:08:42] June I believe it's on the 16th through
[2:08:44] the 18th. It's on the Monday following
[2:08:46] Father's Day. I believe that's June the
[2:08:48] 15th on that Sunday. So, we're going to
[2:08:50] leave on on the Monday morning, take all
[2:08:53] the young people, and uh we've uh we're
[2:08:55] going to rent uh several condos. We have
[2:08:58] condos for the girls, condos for the
[2:09:00] boys, and uh so we're going to have a
[2:09:02] really good time. We're going to
[2:09:03] Branson, I think. Uh plan on going to
[2:09:06] Silver Dollar City and some different
[2:09:07] things with the young people. So, uh
[2:09:09] always enjoy being able to do that. Um
[2:09:12] all of the young people are invited to
[2:09:14] go. It doesn't matter how old you are.
[2:09:15] Uh we certainly want everybody to come.
[2:09:17] We're paying for all the young people.
[2:09:18] We'll pay for all their food, all their
[2:09:20] stay, uh their uh trip there, uh at the
[2:09:23] park and all that, food vouchers and all
[2:09:25] that's all taken care of. Finances. Um
[2:09:28] the only thing that we uh request uh and
[2:09:31] I say request differently. Only thing
[2:09:33] that we require is that if you're under
[2:09:35] 13 years old that you have a guardian or
[2:09:38] a parent to come with you. So we'll take
[2:09:39] all 13 year olds and up and we'll be
[2:09:42] responsible. uh but under 13 still
[2:09:45] welcome to go. We'll still take care of
[2:09:46] the bill. Uh but we just need a
[2:09:48] guardian, somebody that can sign off to
[2:09:50] take care of. And u and y'all I promise
[2:09:52] you, you don't want me keeping up with
[2:09:54] 35 seven year olds. I'd have a blast
[2:09:57] doing it, but we might lose a couple of
[2:09:58] them in the cave down there. So, if we
[2:10:00] want them all to come back, we need we
[2:10:02] need some parents and guardians to go
[2:10:04] with the little ones. Uh, also if you'd
[2:10:06] be willing to chaperon in the older
[2:10:09] group, um, then we'll just write your
[2:10:11] name on the list, the signup sheets in
[2:10:13] the back of the church, and we'll be
[2:10:14] contacting those that we'd like to be
[2:10:17] able to go. Um, if anybody else would
[2:10:19] like to attend, uh, we have a a price
[2:10:22] per person. Um, and we can discuss that.
[2:10:26] It's so we just we don't want anybody
[2:10:28] left out. So even if you're if you just
[2:10:30] feel young and you want to go, you're
[2:10:31] welcome to go. So we don't want nobody
[2:10:33] left out. We just want to go and and
[2:10:35] have a good time with the young people
[2:10:36] and I thank God that he's given us the
[2:10:38] ability to do that. And I thank our
[2:10:41] young people. They mean the world to me
[2:10:42] and I know they do to you also. And uh
[2:10:45] just having the privilege to be able to
[2:10:47] go and and do fun things with them. I
[2:10:50] always uh have that on my heart to do.
[2:10:52] And uh they they they love the Lord so
[2:10:54] much. They'll do anything for you.
[2:10:55] They're the first ones to volunteer and
[2:10:57] help. And so we always want to reward
[2:11:00] all of that. So, uh, just remember that
[2:11:03] coming up. Also, Brother Sean's meeting
[2:11:06] out, tent meeting starts next week on
[2:11:08] Wednesday night. Brother Daryl Ward will
[2:11:10] be, uh, starting that meeting out. And
[2:11:12] I'll be home, Lord willing. I'll take
[2:11:15] the service here Sunday and Wednesday
[2:11:17] night also. Uh, then plan on flying out
[2:11:19] on Thursday morning. And, and I'll be
[2:11:22] ministering during that meeting. Also,
[2:11:24] Brother Andrew will be there
[2:11:26] ministering. And so if anybody'd like to
[2:11:27] go, brother Sean extended an invitation
[2:11:30] to be there. Brother Joe will be
[2:11:32] speaking uh here at the home church on
[2:11:35] that Sunday uh of the meeting. So
[2:11:39] brother Joe, you're not going to be able
[2:11:40] to go to the tent tent
[2:11:42] meet. But if he can pull that off, he's
[2:11:45] a greater man than I
[2:11:46] thought. I think he's a great man.
[2:11:50] But Lord, we'll just uh just just be
[2:11:55] anticipating the prayers for that. Just
[2:11:57] expecting God to do great things.
[2:11:59] And just want to remember have some
[2:12:01] requests. Remember sister Destiny was
[2:12:03] not feeling well tonight. Um also
[2:12:06] Denanishia had asked for prayer before
[2:12:08] service having some bad headaches. Asked
[2:12:10] the church to pray for her. I don't know
[2:12:12] if we had a request up. And uh also for
[2:12:15] brother Morgan's uncle Kevin. He they
[2:12:17] took him to the hospital uh thought he
[2:12:20] had had a many stroke asked the Lord to
[2:12:22] touch his body and I know that God is
[2:12:25] certainly mindful. Brother Brian, would
[2:12:27] you mind to come and close us in a in a
[2:12:29] in a word of prayer tonight? Just
[2:12:31] remember these as you
[2:12:38] go our hearts. Gracious heavenly father,
[2:12:42] Lord, we always count it a privilege and
[2:12:44] an honor, Lord, that we could come
[2:12:46] before you, Lord, knowing that you've
[2:12:49] called us, Lord, before, Lord. We even
[2:12:51] knew one another, Lord. But you've seen
[2:12:53] this day, Lord, and you've seen this
[2:12:55] service, Lord. Father, we always gather
[2:12:58] with great expectations of what you will
[2:13:00] do, Lord. But Lord, if we could just
[2:13:02] meet your expectations of us, Lord.
[2:13:05] Father, we thank you, Lord, for the
[2:13:07] revealed word for this hour, Lord.
[2:13:10] Father, for these requests, Lord, that's
[2:13:11] been laid before you, Father God. We
[2:13:13] know you've already seen the need, but
[2:13:16] Father, we come, Lord, knowing, Father,
[2:13:18] that you're mindful of us, Lord, and
[2:13:20] that you care for us, Lord. Father God,
[2:13:23] knowing that you come yourself, Lord
[2:13:25] God, to bind up the brokenhearted, Lord,
[2:13:27] to bind up the sick, Father, and hold
[2:13:30] them close to you, Lord. Father, go with
[2:13:33] us, Lord, as we go from this place,
[2:13:35] Lord, that our hearts are always burning
[2:13:38] for you, Lord. And that our conversation
[2:13:40] is of you, Lord. Father God, keep your
[2:13:43] hand of protection upon each child,
[2:13:46] Lord. Father, these trips that's coming
[2:13:49] up for the youth, Lord. Father, that
[2:13:51] they could just see, Lord, the
[2:13:53] importance of your word, Father God,
[2:13:56] that they would be so entitled to ask
[2:13:58] questions, to dig in, Father, to know
[2:14:01] who they are in you, Lord. Father, we
[2:14:04] ask you all these things, Lord. Let our
[2:14:06] hearts always burn, Father. Lord, I ask
[2:14:08] you, Lord, and I I'm so thankful for
[2:14:11] this church, Lord. Father, and for the
[2:14:13] precious people that are here,
[2:14:15] Lord. Father, it's such a place of rest.
[2:14:19] And I'm so thankful. Father God, I ask
[2:14:22] you to bless each individual one just
[2:14:24] for being so great, Lord. I ask all
[2:14:27] these things in your precious name,
[2:14:29] Lord, Jesus Christ's name.
[2:14:35] Amen. Amen. God bless you tonight as you
[2:14:38] go victory in Jesus name. Amen. and just
[2:14:42] go walking with the Lord.
[2:14:45] Amen. Well, I heard an old old
[2:14:52] story how the Savior came from
[2:14:57] glory. How he made the lame to walk
[2:15:01] again and he caused the blind to
[2:15:09] see.
[2:15:11] His precious blood
[2:15:15] atone and I
[2:15:18] repented of my sins and won the
[2:15:23] victory. I say
[2:15:26] victory in
[2:15:28] Jesus my
[2:15:31] savior forever.
[2:15:33] Well, he sought me and he bought me with
[2:15:39] his redeeming
[2:15:41] blood. He loved me before I ever knew
[2:15:46] him. And all my love is to him. Well, he
[2:15:52] punched me to
[2:15:55] victory beneath the cleansing
[2:15:59] blood. Well, I heard about his
[2:16:03] healing of his cleansing power
[2:16:08] revealing. How he made the lame to walk
[2:16:12] again. And he calls the blind to
[2:16:16] see. And then I cried, "Dear
[2:16:20] Jesus, come and heal my broken spirit."
[2:16:26] And somehow Jesus, he came and brought
[2:16:30] to me the
[2:16:33] victory. I say
[2:16:36] victory in
[2:16:38] Jesus my
[2:16:40] savior
[2:16:42] [Music]
[2:16:49] forever. Hey. Hey. Hey.
