[47:35] chapter and we'll start in the 10th
[47:37] verse so 2 Corinthians 7 and the 10th
[47:40] verse and give you just a moment to get
[47:42] there how many's looking forward to the
[47:44] meetings amen and they're bringing the
[47:47] tent out this afternoon to get that set
[47:49] up and uh just can't wait to to be able
[47:52] to get there we have the uh we're going
[47:54] to work on to I guess guess this
[47:56] afternoon some are kind of helping get
[47:57] that uh going and then also uh uh
[48:00] tomorrow and uh just just making a way
[48:03] to have it we have people coming from a
[48:05] lot of different states and so we're
[48:07] looking forward to a real outpouring of
[48:08] the Holy Ghost amen I just always come
[48:11] expecting a move of God Amen I believe
[48:14] that believe that's the way we ought to
[48:16] approach every Service uh I believe we
[48:18] come this morning for the same purpose
[48:20] we come expecting God to move and to
[48:22] speak how many expect God to speak to
[48:23] your heart amen I believe that you do or
[48:26] you wouldn't be here I believe that's
[48:27] your purpose of being here is you have
[48:29] confidence not in a man but that we can
[48:31] get out of the way and allow God to
[48:33] speak to us amen that ought to be our
[48:35] desire I want to speak from 2
[48:37] Corinthians out of the seventh chapter
[48:39] and we're going to read from the first
[48:41] verse Paul said having therefore these
[48:44] promises dearly beloved let us cleanse
[48:47] ourselves from all filthiness of the
[48:49] Flesh and spirit perfecting Holiness in
[48:52] the fear of God and would us ask the
[48:54] Lord to add his Blessing to the reading
[48:56] of the word and I want to speak this
[48:58] morning on a subject we've been
[48:59] preaching on a on a series of the
[49:01] bride's position and uh and I want to
[49:04] have a sub text this morning on a
[49:07] perfect Holiness a perfect Holiness uh I
[49:10] hope this has been a blessing to you
[49:12] we've been uh speaking on this along
[49:15] these this series on the position of the
[49:17] bride and and I hopefully that uh that
[49:21] that that you've seen the connection in
[49:22] it if you've been listening to each
[49:24] service that uh that there was a purpose
[49:26] of that the purpose of it I I'm not uh
[49:29] preaching this just to uh to have a
[49:31] series or look like I'm important or
[49:33] something like that or to uh have no
[49:35] motive that way at all but uh but
[49:37] there's really a connection that the
[49:39] Lord has been uh just opening up to my
[49:41] heart and and the the very purpose of it
[49:43] just to speak my heart this morning is
[49:46] is to bring people into their position
[49:47] in Christ I believe that's where we all
[49:49] must be and so uh it has to be preached
[49:52] or people can't get there that's the way
[49:53] we get to get to our place but said see
[49:56] what God is trying to do he's trying to
[49:58] place his church in position to manifest
[50:00] himself getting one that he can work
[50:02] through and say there is my spirit
[50:05] flowing freely there it is he said now
[50:07] then I can work and then he'll go and
[50:09] he'll get another one and over there and
[50:11] he'll Place him and so then he'll go
[50:13] brother Jared and get another one and
[50:15] place him and another one and place her
[50:17] and and the whole entire time God has
[50:19] building up a people that he can work
[50:21] through and speak through and and
[50:22] manifest himself through brother R said
[50:24] this is what the uh this is uh the
[50:26] purpose of God it's adoption and placing
[50:29] and manifestation and uh you this is
[50:31] what the Bible says brother Mark it says
[50:32] that all creation is waiting on the
[50:35] manifestation of the sons of God so
[50:37] we've been uh speaking on this uh series
[50:40] for that very purpose to bring people
[50:42] into their position in Christ I I don't
[50:44] know the saddest thing that you ever see
[50:46] is people that live below their
[50:47] privilege can you imagine having having
[50:49] a few million dollars in the bank and
[50:51] not knowing how to write a check it'd be
[50:53] a sad thing to know that you had access
[50:55] to the funds but you was living in broke
[50:57] and living in poverty and the and the
[50:58] whole time you had access to uh to to
[51:01] funds and so we just want to be able to
[51:03] be in our position and recognize who we
[51:05] are and be able to take the checkbook
[51:06] that God has given us and write it for
[51:08] what we have need of him so in this
[51:10] series of the bride's position we
[51:12] started out with uh having power over
[51:15] the devil or that the bride's position
[51:16] was over the devil but under God how
[51:18] many remember that when we started it
[51:20] was because we were subject to the word
[51:22] that's what gave the church power we
[51:23] went through all these different parts
[51:25] of of the purpose of God and the life of
[51:27] Joseph and went through all how God
[51:29] would would bring you through to get you
[51:30] to the place that he wanted to he'll you
[51:32] know he'll do whatever it takes we we
[51:35] spoke on the king's invitation and how
[51:37] that the only way you can come to this
[51:39] position is if you were invited to it so
[51:41] it isn't just everybody uh that can that
[51:43] can have it but God invited you so we
[51:45] have a we have a reason to be here this
[51:47] morning and you say well how how would
[51:49] it be done then I spoke on by my spirit
[51:51] sayeth the Lord not by might or by power
[51:53] but only by the spirit of God and and
[51:55] went through how that it was paid for
[51:57] the price of redemption through the Book
[51:58] of Ruth and how that he that he
[52:00] purchased possession to bring her into a
[52:02] place it wasn't for it wasn't that he
[52:04] paid for it all brother Mark to get the
[52:06] land or to or to just redeem the Earth
[52:08] but he wanted the bride that was in the
[52:10] earth and so uh you know as we went
[52:12] through this down to the last service
[52:14] and uh on the last service we were
[52:16] speaking on the bride being the
[52:18] Overcomers of leot DEA this was two
[52:20] Sundays ago and and so he took that
[52:22] direction of of being an overcomer and
[52:24] and had went through how that we had
[52:27] returned back into the land and in this
[52:29] land it was filled with the promises of
[52:30] God and and we received those promises
[52:32] so I know I'm just kind of giving a
[52:34] background because it's been a few days
[52:36] but how many remember the promises that
[52:37] God had made us so remember it was the
[52:39] Overcomers of laod DEA they would
[52:41] receive a promise how many how many
[52:43] recognizes that you're those people that
[52:45] God has given you a promise in this day
[52:47] and so we preached on this last time of
[52:49] how that he said I'll make a pillar in
[52:51] the temple of my God and he shall he
[52:53] shall no more go out I ride up on them
[52:55] the the name of God they'll be clothed
[52:56] in white rment I'll will not blot their
[52:57] name out of the book of life I will
[52:59] confess his name before the father and
[53:01] before the angels I will give him a
[53:03] white stone and on that stone a new name
[53:05] written so if your name was bad it's
[53:07] okay he said I'll write them a new name
[53:08] it was it was Mrs Jesus Christ they
[53:11] would take on the character of Christ so
[53:13] it wouldn't be by your own flesh or by
[53:14] your own failures but it was the but but
[53:16] it was his fa it was his flesh it was
[53:18] his life that that was given for you he
[53:20] said I'll give them power over the
[53:22] Nations I will give them a Morning Star
[53:23] you should not be hurt of the second
[53:25] death I say Amen to that he'll give you
[53:27] to feed of hidden Mana he'll give you to
[53:30] eat of the tree of life that was in the
[53:32] paradise of God the very that that Adam
[53:34] had lost he would return to the church
[53:36] in this last day and then finally he
[53:38] said I will grant to him to sit with me
[53:41] in my Throne he that overcometh I will
[53:43] grant to sit with me in my throne and
[53:44] brother martin these promises they
[53:46] weren't just for they weren't just put
[53:48] out there for for for some great body or
[53:50] something like that but they were
[53:51] promises to individuals how many say
[53:53] Amen to that it was promis proes to
[53:55] individuals it was you and I how many
[53:57] how many could put your name there this
[53:58] morning and look at the promises of God
[54:00] and say that was designed purposely for
[54:02] me can you can you think of that brother
[54:04] Tom that when God wrote this and he had
[54:06] it on his mind and he came down and put
[54:08] the V the vision in the heart of a
[54:10] prophet that was laying on the aisle of
[54:12] patmas and he was praying and God gave
[54:14] him that Vision he gave the vision with
[54:16] your name on his mind he said this is
[54:18] the promise for Jared hams this is the
[54:20] promise for Travis ker this is the
[54:22] promise for Wesley this is the promise
[54:24] for David M this is a a promise for
[54:26] Ronnie mansfi this is this is a promise
[54:28] for you it was a personal promise an
[54:31] individual promise to you and I but
[54:33] after preaching on these promises as I
[54:35] was praying about the service this
[54:37] coming week I came across this uh the
[54:39] scripture the Lord just opened this up
[54:40] to me and after preaching on all these
[54:42] promises it brought me to this place
[54:44] where Apostle Paul says he says having
[54:46] therefore these promises dearly beloved
[54:49] let us cleanse ourselves from all
[54:51] filthiness of the Flesh and spirit
[54:53] perfecting holiness in the fear of God
[54:56] it brought me to this part this is the
[54:57] bride's position is a perfect Holiness
[55:00] here you know whenever you go to
[55:01] speaking on Holiness you realize there's
[55:03] two sides to Holiness or maybe many
[55:05] sides but but there's one group that'll
[55:07] tell you that there like the Pharisees
[55:09] that they were in the days of Jesus and
[55:10] they and they they dressed everything
[55:12] right they wore everything on the
[55:13] outward outward appar was just right
[55:16] brother Mark the robes went down to the
[55:17] ground the bells were in the right place
[55:19] they walk they walked according to the
[55:21] to the law of God and many today will do
[55:23] the same thing and if they can get you
[55:25] dress right they think you're okay and
[55:26] if they can get you to look right on the
[55:28] outside well then they think you're okay
[55:30] and and but but just as the Pharisees
[55:32] that just wasn't enough and then there
[55:33] was another group that says well it
[55:35] don't matter how you live as long as you
[55:36] just accept Christ and and because you
[55:38] have Christ well then you're holy and
[55:40] you can you can live any way and you can
[55:42] you can dress any way and them other
[55:43] people are legalist and so you see
[55:45] there's a there's a Far Side one way and
[55:47] then there's a Far Side the other and
[55:49] and ain't neither one of them right and
[55:50] you know and I I think about how the
[55:52] world has gotten today and how that that
[55:54] Holy H is a thing of the past it's
[55:56] something that's old natured it's
[55:57] something that's oldfashioned and and
[55:59] you realize that the world today has
[56:01] replaced Holiness with religion and they
[56:03] they've replaced Holiness with going to
[56:04] church and they've replaced Holiness
[56:06] with with being a part of a body of
[56:08] people or a part of a group and and they
[56:09] replaced Holiness with having a a priest
[56:12] or a bishop or a pastor or somebody that
[56:14] that they set as a hierarchy over their
[56:16] life and as long as that person accepts
[56:18] them well then God's going to accept
[56:20] them so it didn't matter how they lived
[56:21] and so they made men holy they made
[56:23] churches holy and theyve established
[56:25] these great holy movements and things
[56:27] like that but brother brma said like
[56:29] this he said see the almighty God The
[56:31] Great I Am he has come as a spirit to
[56:34] fill his true church and he has a right
[56:36] to move anywhere he wants to and upon
[56:39] anybody he wants to he said that's why
[56:41] we don't make any holy men Among Us he
[56:43] said but the whole Congregation of the
[56:45] Lord Is Holy because of the presence of
[56:47] the Holy Spirit it is he the holy spirit
[56:50] that is Holy it's not the congregation
[56:52] of itself you see so so rituals they'll
[56:55] never make you holy Holiness is an
[56:57] inward work brother Mark and it's
[56:58] expressed outwardly it's something that
[57:00] God is doing on the inside of a life and
[57:02] he expresses it on the outside of a life
[57:04] I know sometimes people they'll live
[57:06] years of their life they'll listen to
[57:08] messages and they'll go to church and
[57:09] they'll they'll listen to the preaching
[57:11] of the word and but they'll still yet do
[57:13] things that they know are wrong they'll
[57:14] come to church week in and week out and
[57:16] they'll go out of church and they'll do
[57:17] things wrong and they'll do things that
[57:19] they know that are not pleasing to God
[57:21] and and they know that are not according
[57:22] to the word and they use this very quote
[57:25] as a crutch and say well after all
[57:26] Holiness is an inward work and it's
[57:29] expressed outwardly so whenever God
[57:31] takes that desire that I'll quit doing
[57:32] it and and if God will deliver me when
[57:35] he wants me free of it then God's going
[57:37] to come and he's going to supernaturally
[57:38] he's going to take that out of my life
[57:40] and when God wants me to be free and
[57:42] he'll take that from me and when he
[57:43] wants me to be free he'll take this from
[57:45] me and when he wants me to be free he'll
[57:47] cause me to not have a desire from it
[57:48] anymore that but let me tell you
[57:50] something friends that God is not going
[57:52] to deliver you when God wants you to be
[57:54] free God is going to deliver you when
[57:56] you want to be free see there there's
[57:58] something that we have to do I think
[57:59] people have heard so much but the mark
[58:01] that they think they have nothing to do
[58:02] with it but isn't what Apostle Paul says
[58:04] he said let us cleanse ourselves it
[58:08] ain't just something that God's going to
[58:09] do but it takes us Paul said let us
[58:11] cleanse ourselves let me ask you this
[58:13] this morning what good is religion is
[58:15] there if there's no life to back it up
[58:17] what good is going to church if there's
[58:18] no life to back it up this is a the very
[58:21] human nature that we live in brother
[58:22] Mark misunderstands what to be holy even
[58:25] is they're waiting on God to do
[58:27] something but Paul said let us cleanse
[58:29] oursel see God has called the church to
[58:31] a place of Holiness he's called us to a
[58:33] place of Fellowship a place of true
[58:35] worship a place that we can fall in love
[58:38] with God again where you can look at
[58:39] yourself in the mirror and you realize
[58:41] that the very life of God that is living
[58:43] on the inside of you that that it
[58:45] supersedes even the mistakes that you
[58:47] make that's the life of a believer of a
[58:49] Christian but he called the church but
[58:52] it's up to the church to respond he
[58:54] called you as as an individual but it's
[58:56] up to you to respond we're not waiting
[58:57] on somebody else to tell us how to how
[58:59] to act and and how to conduct ourselves
[59:02] and but God is calling us and he's
[59:04] waiting on you to respond see to be holy
[59:07] means to be dedicated or consecrated to
[59:09] God it's a dedicated life a consecrated
[59:12] life to God I I remember when God Called
[59:15] Moses you remember the story the first
[59:16] time you see this great call of God all
[59:19] the way back whenever the children of
[59:20] Israel were tied up in in in in this
[59:23] land of Egypt and God had called Moses
[59:25] to come down and you remember whenever
[59:27] God or Moses is going out through the
[59:29] Wilderness and here he is walking alone
[59:31] and and and he and he comes out one day
[59:34] and he looks up on a mountain and he
[59:35] sees this this curious side of a bush
[59:38] that was burning with fire you remember
[59:39] as God called him he's about to call
[59:41] call him to go do a work for the Lord
[59:43] he's he's going to use him he's going to
[59:45] use the gift that's in his life and so
[59:47] God begins to call on him and when God
[59:49] calls him notice he takes him to a place
[59:51] of Holiness the very first place that
[59:53] Moses goes to is he comes to this place
[59:55] and the Lord says Moses take off your
[59:57] shoes for you are standing on Holy
[59:59] Ground isn't it something that when God
[1:00:02] was ready to use him brother Mark first
[1:00:03] he brought him to this holy place he
[1:00:05] brought him to a place that that that
[1:00:07] that was such a a holy place or this
[1:00:09] Holy Ground brother Mark it was so
[1:00:10] esteemed by men today watch the the
[1:00:12] nature of humanity not even
[1:00:14] understanding Holiness that today that
[1:00:16] you realize there's a monastery that
[1:00:18] actually sits near the bush where they
[1:00:19] believe that Moses went to in sin Egypt
[1:00:22] you can find it's called St Catherine's
[1:00:23] Monastery you can read about it but
[1:00:25] there this Monastery sits and they're
[1:00:27] protecting the actual Bush that was
[1:00:29] either the bush or the descendant of the
[1:00:31] Bush that Moses that God came and spoke
[1:00:33] to Moses on and they said well it's such
[1:00:35] a great Bush and it's a holy Bush and so
[1:00:37] they they've built this this way this is
[1:00:39] the nature of men you remember well on
[1:00:41] Mount Transfiguration when the disciples
[1:00:42] went up there with Jesus and and so when
[1:00:44] it they went there remember they saw
[1:00:46] Moses and Elijah and Jesus standing
[1:00:48] there remember he was transfigured
[1:00:49] before their face and into this great
[1:00:52] light and so remember they they had a
[1:00:53] desire we're going going to build three
[1:00:55] temples one for Moses and one for Elijah
[1:00:57] and one for Jesus and and so they they
[1:00:59] went out and all of a sudden they heard
[1:01:00] this great voice speak and said this is
[1:01:02] my beloved Son in whom I am well pleased
[1:01:04] hear ye him but the presence of God
[1:01:07] Brother David it was so strong that they
[1:01:09] fell on their face before the Lord they
[1:01:11] because of the presence of God brother
[1:01:13] Mark this became a holy place because
[1:01:15] God was there and all of a sudden as
[1:01:17] they fell on their face Jesus come and
[1:01:19] he and he said arise and be not afraid
[1:01:21] and he touched them and the Bible said
[1:01:23] when they lifted up their eyes they saw
[1:01:25] no man except Jesus only but remember
[1:01:28] whenever Peter goes speaking of this
[1:01:29] later and he gives testimony of it he
[1:01:31] said Remember the Holy Mountain remember
[1:01:35] what happened on the Holy Mountain isn't
[1:01:37] it something about the nature of men
[1:01:39] that they put a monastery on Moses's on
[1:01:41] the on the bush where Moses went to and
[1:01:43] said Remember the holy Bush isn't this
[1:01:45] something here Peter says remember the
[1:01:47] Holy Mountain this is just the nature of
[1:01:49] men but we realize that we're always
[1:01:50] trying to make something holy we always
[1:01:52] trying to make somebody holy or or
[1:01:54] something holy or some place holy but
[1:01:56] you realize that the mountain wasn't
[1:01:58] holy at all it wasn't a Holy Mountain
[1:02:00] the ground wasn't Holy Ground the bush
[1:02:02] wasn't a holy Bush the man wasn't a holy
[1:02:04] man you say but but God said it was Holy
[1:02:06] Ground but the only reason he said it is
[1:02:08] because the presence of God was there so
[1:02:11] we find out there ain't but one thing
[1:02:12] that is Holy and that's the god of
[1:02:14] Heaven that's why the angels of heaven
[1:02:16] are sitting around the throne today and
[1:02:18] they're crying out holy holy holy unto
[1:02:20] the Lord friends if you could tap into
[1:02:22] it this morning and you could hear the
[1:02:24] angels of God You' hear them crying holy
[1:02:26] they're crying all day today all night
[1:02:29] tonight holy holy holy before the Lord
[1:02:31] God Almighty he's the only one that is
[1:02:33] Holy in this flesh this flesh ain't
[1:02:35] never holy that mountain was never holy
[1:02:37] the ground was never holy the Bush was
[1:02:39] never holy the only thing holy about it
[1:02:42] is that God was present in that place
[1:02:45] and wherever God is is a holy
[1:02:47] Place friends I got news for you this
[1:02:50] morning he won't dwell in a dirty house
[1:02:53] hello somebody
[1:02:55] he won't dwell in a dirty house my I
[1:02:57] thought about this brother Mark if the
[1:02:59] presence of God can make ground Holy
[1:03:02] Ground you ever thought about it the
[1:03:04] presence of God could make dirt holy the
[1:03:07] can you imagine this old dirt it's the
[1:03:10] filthiest thing there is it's what your
[1:03:12] mama makes you wash off your hands
[1:03:13] whenever you go inside it's where all
[1:03:15] the dung and all the garbage and the
[1:03:17] filth of the world lands it's the
[1:03:19] filthiest thing there is if he can make
[1:03:22] dirt holy then what can he do with you
[1:03:24] you and I what can he do here this
[1:03:26] morning with a heart that is surrendered
[1:03:29] a ground Brother David that has no will
[1:03:32] has no willpower has has no desire and
[1:03:35] he could call it Holy Ground then what
[1:03:37] about a human being that surrenders to
[1:03:39] the will of God my I think this is so
[1:03:41] powerful this morning to think if the
[1:03:43] presence of God can make the dust of the
[1:03:45] ground Holy Ground that that dust of the
[1:03:48] ground that is that is made up of the
[1:03:49] elements of the world of oxygen and
[1:03:51] carbon and calcium and potassium and
[1:03:53] sodium and magnesium these are not these
[1:03:55] are not holy elements they're just the
[1:03:57] elements that God created the world with
[1:03:59] but he looked at it and he said take off
[1:04:01] your shoes for the ground you're
[1:04:02] standing on it's Holy Ground oh my isn't
[1:04:04] this something don't you know that
[1:04:06] whenever God made man in the beginning
[1:04:07] brother Wes I think this is wonderful
[1:04:09] when God created man the Bible says God
[1:04:12] made Man Out of the Dust of the ground I
[1:04:15] thought isn't it something that if he
[1:04:16] could look at that ground in the days of
[1:04:18] Moses the very same elements that are in
[1:04:20] that ground that Moses was walking on
[1:04:22] are the same elements that are in your
[1:04:23] human body today I thought my and if the
[1:04:26] presence of God can make that dirt holy
[1:04:28] then the presence of God can make this
[1:04:30] dirt holy if he can make that ground
[1:04:32] holy then what about this ground if you
[1:04:34] can make those elements holy what about
[1:04:36] these
[1:04:37] elements but what did he do he proved it
[1:04:40] in the days of Moses that it was Holy
[1:04:41] Ground you say well how did he prove it
[1:04:43] he proved it by the supernatural he
[1:04:45] proved it by there was a bush that was
[1:04:47] Burning Brother Martin that wasn't
[1:04:49] consumed see here God he came in and he
[1:04:52] dwelt in this place and he vind V ated
[1:04:54] his presence in that place by a bush
[1:04:57] that was burning that wasn't consumed
[1:04:59] isn't it something he vindicates by his
[1:05:01] presence by the supernatural but say see
[1:05:04] remember he said it had been very
[1:05:06] marvelous three and a half years in
[1:05:09] Jerusalem that had a Revival the great
[1:05:12] anticipations waiting upon the people on
[1:05:14] a man that the world and the church
[1:05:16] rejected the Lord Jesus he was
[1:05:18] considered a fanatic he said we'd call
[1:05:20] him today if we put it in our words we'd
[1:05:22] call him a Holy Roller
[1:05:24] my Jesus the Holy Roller we'd call him a
[1:05:27] Holy Roller he absolutely disagreed with
[1:05:30] their theology but yet God Vindicated
[1:05:33] that he was with him isn't that
[1:05:35] something Jesus the Holy Roller he
[1:05:37] disagreed with their theology but God
[1:05:39] Vindicated he was with him by the
[1:05:41] Supernatural That's why Peter would say
[1:05:43] he said you men of Israel you should
[1:05:45] have known he said for this Jesus of
[1:05:47] Nazareth was a man approved of God by
[1:05:49] you by signs and wonders watch how God
[1:05:51] vindicates that it was a holy place he
[1:05:53] vindicates Ates it was a Holy Ground by
[1:05:55] the supernatural Peter said see Jesus of
[1:05:57] Nazareth was approved of God among you
[1:06:00] by signs and wonders which God did by
[1:06:02] him in the midst of you all and you are
[1:06:05] all you know and are witnesses of but
[1:06:08] with Wicked hands you've crucified him
[1:06:10] you're Witnesses of it you all saw it
[1:06:12] you seen him when he hung on calvary's
[1:06:14] Cross you saw him when he was at Pilot's
[1:06:16] judgment Hall you saw as the people they
[1:06:18] they they they freed barabus and and and
[1:06:20] Let Jesus go to the Cross you all
[1:06:22] Witnesses of it and you saw it but Peter
[1:06:24] said but we're Witnesses of another
[1:06:26] thing he said for the Jesus hath God
[1:06:28] raised up and wherefore we are all
[1:06:31] Witnesses of his resurrection he said
[1:06:33] see you witnessed one thing but we've
[1:06:35] witnessed another he said you witnessed
[1:06:37] to crucifixion but I'm a witness to the
[1:06:39] resurrection you're a witness of his
[1:06:41] death but I'm a witness of his life
[1:06:43] friend let me tell you this morning I
[1:06:44] say to every critic and to every
[1:06:46] Challenger of the Gospel of Jesus Christ
[1:06:49] the critic Witnesses every backslid
[1:06:51] church member but I'm a witness when
[1:06:53] they came back to God you're a witness
[1:06:54] whenever they went out in the world but
[1:06:56] I'm a witness when they came down to the
[1:06:58] Altar and they repented of their sins
[1:07:00] and they gave their heart to God let me
[1:07:02] tell you it may look like a bunch of
[1:07:03] Unholy people to you it may look like
[1:07:05] people that fall and make mistakes but
[1:07:07] I'm a witness when they came back and
[1:07:09] they cleaned out their life and they
[1:07:11] poured their life out before God and God
[1:07:13] came and he filled a human body
[1:07:16] again I'm a witness of them coming
[1:07:20] home he said you saw one thing I saw
[1:07:23] another
[1:07:24] you witness part I witness another part
[1:07:27] see I think men are always limited on
[1:07:29] what they see but the way see they are
[1:07:31] blinded think of this today we are
[1:07:34] blinded by Society we are blinded by
[1:07:38] theologies we're blinded by by by Medias
[1:07:41] we're blinded by churches and rituals
[1:07:44] and all these things that men are so
[1:07:46] blinded by seeking to see the truth
[1:07:49] brother man said see but there's only
[1:07:51] one way to see the truth you remember in
[1:07:53] the day days of Jesus and Peter they
[1:07:56] were they were debating on the on the on
[1:07:58] the godhead in baptism and says see some
[1:08:01] group will say well I'll take what Jesus
[1:08:03] said and the other group said well I'll
[1:08:04] take what Peter said said see but if
[1:08:06] they were contrary one to another then
[1:08:08] what are we going to do if it ain't all
[1:08:10] God then what part of the Bible is right
[1:08:12] so it can't be contrary you can't say
[1:08:14] I'll take Peter and you say well I'll
[1:08:15] take Jesus you have to take the whole
[1:08:17] thing so if there's a contradiction then
[1:08:19] we've missed it somewhere we've missed
[1:08:20] the connection he say so it's got to all
[1:08:23] coincide and come together and only the
[1:08:26] revelation of God will do it our schools
[1:08:28] will never teach it it's a revelation
[1:08:31] that you must see it see it takes a
[1:08:33] revelation to see the things of God it
[1:08:36] takes a revelation and brother martin
[1:08:38] not all will see it for Jesus said it
[1:08:40] like this he said father I thank you
[1:08:41] you've hided these things from the eyes
[1:08:43] of the wise and prudent but you revealed
[1:08:44] it unto babes that would receive see it
[1:08:47] takes a revelation to see the work of
[1:08:49] God remember when Jesus asked Peter that
[1:08:51] very question he said Peter who do men
[1:08:54] say that I am he said some say that
[1:08:56] you're Elijah or one of the prophets and
[1:08:59] you're a great man you're a minister
[1:09:00] you're all these wonderful things he
[1:09:01] said but Peter but who do you say that I
[1:09:03] am he said I say you're the Christ the
[1:09:06] son of the Living God do you realize
[1:09:07] that here were there were many men that
[1:09:09] walked side by side with Peter he sat
[1:09:11] down in the restaurant and he ate with
[1:09:12] him he went out fishing and he fished
[1:09:15] with him and many men saw the same man
[1:09:17] that Peter saw but some of them called
[1:09:19] him one thing and Peter called him
[1:09:20] another see it takes a revelation to
[1:09:22] recognize who Christ is he said you are
[1:09:24] the Son of God do you realize that the
[1:09:26] majority of the world today don't
[1:09:28] believe that Jesus Christ was the son of
[1:09:30] God but here's a body of people let me
[1:09:32] ask you this this morning Peter who do
[1:09:34] you say that I am I wonder if there's
[1:09:36] somebody this morning that had the
[1:09:37] Revelation that Peter had and say he was
[1:09:39] the he was Christ he was the son of the
[1:09:41] Living God he he wasn't just a man that
[1:09:44] was born of a woman he wasn't just a man
[1:09:46] that that that came from an act between
[1:09:48] Joseph and Mary but he was a man that
[1:09:50] was placed there by the Holy Ghost he
[1:09:52] was conceived by the Holy Ghost and he
[1:09:54] was formed in the womb of his mother for
[1:09:56] the very purpose of saving Humanity he's
[1:09:59] Christ the son of the Living God see but
[1:10:01] they can't all see it but think about
[1:10:03] what they what could they not see they
[1:10:05] couldn't see the age that they were
[1:10:06] living in they couldn't see modern
[1:10:08] events that were made known by prophecy
[1:10:09] here John the Baptist was a man that was
[1:10:11] laying over in a prison cell and they
[1:10:13] they couldn't even recognize who he was
[1:10:15] but Jesus began speaking about John here
[1:10:17] here they had him locked in prison
[1:10:19] because because of his ministry and
[1:10:20] because of his stand and and because it
[1:10:22] contradicted the way that they believed
[1:10:24] and and it kind of ruffled their
[1:10:25] feathers a little bit isn't it something
[1:10:26] about human nature when when somebody
[1:10:28] when they get when somebody gets on to
[1:10:30] you it makes you all ruffled up and and
[1:10:32] they'll quit going to church well I'm
[1:10:33] not going to talk to you no more or
[1:10:35] we'll just lock him in prison if we had
[1:10:36] the power to keep his mouth shut that's
[1:10:39] what they did to John CU they didn't
[1:10:40] like that kind of preaching so they
[1:10:42] locked him up and Jesus said who did you
[1:10:44] go out in the wilderness to see was it a
[1:10:45] re shaking in the wind a man clothed in
[1:10:48] soft rment what did you expect to see
[1:10:49] when you went there he said only King's
[1:10:51] houses do they dress in soft rment did
[1:10:53] you you go to see a prophet but I say to
[1:10:55] you he was more than a prophet he was
[1:10:57] the Fulfillment of Malachi the third
[1:10:59] chapter he was the very one that God
[1:11:01] said would come and and forerun the
[1:11:04] coming of Christ it is he whom is
[1:11:06] written he said and if you will receive
[1:11:08] it this is Elijah that was for to come
[1:11:11] he was a very fulfillment brother Mark
[1:11:12] you see why they had I may as well just
[1:11:14] sit here a minute I'm already here but
[1:11:16] you see why they had so much trouble
[1:11:17] recognizing that it was Elijah because
[1:11:19] his name was John here here Malachi said
[1:11:22] here Elijah shall come the Prophet
[1:11:24] Elijah shall come and here comes a man
[1:11:26] stomping out of the Wilderness what's
[1:11:27] your name my name's John well you can't
[1:11:28] be Elijah you don't even have the right
[1:11:30] name well even even a kindergartener can
[1:11:32] recognize that you aren't him but
[1:11:34] brother Mark they had a revelation that
[1:11:35] was missing they didn't recognize that
[1:11:37] it wasn't the name Elijah but it was the
[1:11:39] spirit of Elijah you remember when
[1:11:41] Elijah went up went up on the uh on on
[1:11:43] his work Elijah the tishby and he
[1:11:45] started his work for the Lord and he
[1:11:47] walked by Elisha plowing in a field and
[1:11:49] he called him to come and follow him
[1:11:51] Elisha throw down his plower and he got
[1:11:53] and he followed with Elijah and Elijah
[1:11:55] asked him he said what would I do to
[1:11:57] thee he said whenever you leave I want a
[1:11:59] double portion of what you have and
[1:12:01] Elijah said if you're with me when I go
[1:12:03] if you see me when I go he said that
[1:12:05] I'll give you a double portion and
[1:12:06] Elisha followed him and he served him
[1:12:08] and he walked all the rest of the days
[1:12:10] of Elijah you couldn't find Elijah that
[1:12:12] was separated from Elisha he served him
[1:12:14] he poured water over his hands he served
[1:12:16] him as a servant he seen the work of God
[1:12:18] moving in his life and when Elijah went
[1:12:21] up to heaven all of a sudden the Bible
[1:12:23] says but then the mantel of Elijah fell
[1:12:25] back on Elisha but you realize that what
[1:12:27] it was it was the very Spirit of Elijah
[1:12:29] he he didn't give him his name he gave
[1:12:31] him his Spirit the spirit of Elijah fell
[1:12:34] on Elisha in so much that when Elisha
[1:12:36] went back to the to the town that they
[1:12:38] came out of and he laid the mantle over
[1:12:40] across the river and the waters parted
[1:12:42] over the river the men up on the
[1:12:43] mountain said there comes Elijah back
[1:12:45] why' they call him Elijah even though it
[1:12:47] was Elisha because he was doing the
[1:12:49] works of Elijah his Spirit was so much
[1:12:51] that men couldn't even recognize who he
[1:12:53] was this is what they had missed even
[1:12:55] Jesus being there remember this is what
[1:12:57] the the prophet spoke of remember Isaiah
[1:13:00] he said a virgin shall conceive and you
[1:13:02] should should call his name Emmanuel he
[1:13:05] here but which was God With Us it wasn't
[1:13:07] the name it was the it was God With Us
[1:13:10] he should be called Emmanuel but his
[1:13:12] name was Jesus you see why they missed
[1:13:14] but Mark here here he said see John John
[1:13:17] sent these men or or John had was sin of
[1:13:19] God and then John in this place he sent
[1:13:22] these men to where Christ was to find
[1:13:24] out if he was the Messiah you see all
[1:13:26] the unanswered question he went to find
[1:13:28] out he said how are you the Messiah but
[1:13:31] notice how he was identified as the
[1:13:33] Christ Jesus didn't say yeah go tell him
[1:13:35] I'm him Jesus said go tell John what you
[1:13:37] saw see notice what God is doing
[1:13:40] vindicating by the supernatural you go
[1:13:44] tell him what you saw he said God Go and
[1:13:47] show John these things that you heard
[1:13:48] and see tell them the blind have
[1:13:50] received their sight tell them the lame
[1:13:52] are walking tell them the lepers are
[1:13:54] cleansed and the deaf here and the dead
[1:13:56] are raised up and the poor have the
[1:13:58] gospel preached unto them is't that
[1:14:00] wonderful here Jesus is quoting the very
[1:14:02] prophecy concerning him John says is it
[1:14:05] you are you the Messiah is this the
[1:14:07] Christ y'all go find out if it's really
[1:14:09] him and he goes and he quotes the very
[1:14:11] fulfillment of the prophecy that was
[1:14:13] prophesied about him and said you go
[1:14:14] telling the blinds receiving their sight
[1:14:16] just like the prophecy said it would
[1:14:18] tell them the deaf are hearing and the
[1:14:19] lame are walking and the poor is getting
[1:14:21] the gospel preached to them it was the
[1:14:23] vindicating of Christ was the
[1:14:25] supernatural this was always Peter's
[1:14:27] stance remember when he was standing at
[1:14:29] Jerusalem he said God proved that that
[1:14:31] that was his beloved Son by signs and
[1:14:35] wonders that he did showing that God was
[1:14:38] with him this was Peter's stance God
[1:14:40] proved it we saw signs and wonders in
[1:14:42] his ministry we're Min we're Witnesses
[1:14:44] of it but do you realize that brother
[1:14:46] bam had the same stance that Peter had
[1:14:48] he said see remember there was a a
[1:14:50] message called the resurrected Lord
[1:14:52] Jesus he actually called calls the
[1:14:53] ministers out in the meeting he said you
[1:14:55] ministering brothers and the Believers
[1:14:57] he said but especially you ministering
[1:14:58] Brothers he said has there ever been a
[1:15:00] time in the church in the last 2,000
[1:15:03] years as the church ever had a Revival
[1:15:05] or any time in the world that the church
[1:15:07] ever had a Revival that there was signs

[1:15:23] wasn't something Supernatural there's
[1:15:25] never been an outpouring of the Holy
[1:15:26] Ghost that there wasn't the supernatural

[1:15:30] Living God living in the people that
[1:15:31] gives the people of view what hope do we
[1:15:34] have unless we know there is something

[1:16:08] the truth Satan is fighting to obstruct
[1:16:10] your view I but I'll tell you what I
[1:16:12] think we need to look at the Devil and
[1:16:13] say get out of my way I remember one
[1:16:15] time I was sitting out we went out to
[1:16:17] visit the Grand Canyon and my what a
[1:16:19] view it was brother Jared we sat there
[1:16:21] and look at that beautiful Canyon and
[1:16:23] and my I was sitting down there on a
[1:16:24] rock and my just Tak it in the view of
[1:16:27] all of God's creation and how wonderful
[1:16:29] that it was and Lord and behold Here
[1:16:31] Comes this group of foreigners from some
[1:16:33] other uh respectful country and they
[1:16:36] came they came walking and and out of
[1:16:38] all the Grand Canyon of aund mile mile
[1:16:41] hundreds of miles of this rim of this
[1:16:43] Canyon they stopped right in front of me
[1:16:45] with their camera just to taking
[1:16:47] pictures I'm sitting back here by myself
[1:16:49] there's a hundred yards either side of
[1:16:51] me you can take a photo but right in the
[1:16:53] middle of my view is where they chose to
[1:16:55] take their
[1:16:56] picture and I sat there for a moment and
[1:16:58] they just all oo and all and taking
[1:17:00] their photo after a little bit I
[1:17:02] respectfully said kind sir you make a
[1:17:04] much better door than a

[1:17:20] because you want to stop right there and
[1:17:22] take your pictures
[1:17:23] you're obstructing my view friends
[1:17:26] that's what the devil's doing today he
[1:17:27] said God would send the supernatural to
[1:17:30] give the people a view you notice why
[1:17:32] that Satan's trying to keep the
[1:17:33] supernatural out he wants to obstruct

[1:17:39] God really is he wants to obstruct The
[1:17:41] View that that you have of eternal life
[1:17:43] he wants to to to hide the view brother
[1:17:45] Mah that you have of Eternity and of a
[1:17:48] of a supernatural and a miracle working
[1:17:50] God but I think as a people we ought to
[1:17:52] look at the Devil and say you make a
[1:17:53] Better Door than a window I ain't going

[1:18:02] the view that block me from being able
[1:18:04] to to be able to serve God no longer
[1:18:06] will I let an obstruction block my view
[1:18:08] and keep me from being able to serve God

[1:18:41] pay brother Mark you have to throw
[1:18:43] things out and do the extra but I say
[1:18:46] it's worth the extra price it's worth
[1:18:48] the sacrifice this morning to have the
[1:18:51] view God took a bush a ground and a
[1:18:55] mountain and it became a place of
[1:18:57] Holiness because of the presence of
[1:19:00] almighty God isn't it something it
[1:19:03] became a holy place that's what God does
[1:19:06] he takes nothing and he makes
[1:19:08] something is there something he takes
[1:19:11] nothing and he makes something remember
[1:19:13] the remember the blind man that didn't
[1:19:15] have he didn't even have eyes in a
[1:19:16] socket and Jesus took that dirt put it
[1:19:18] in his eye and gave him an eye see he
[1:19:20] takes nothing and makes something is
[1:19:23] there something I see brother Mark man
[1:19:24] can try to fix it all up but I don't
[1:19:26] want what man made I want what God does
[1:19:28] I don't want man handle dirt I want God
[1:19:30] handle dirt I don't want the man a man
[1:19:33] could take that ball of dirt it wasn't
[1:19:34] the it wasn't the flesh that done it it
[1:19:36] was the god that done it a man could
[1:19:38] take it and put it in a migan eye
[1:19:39] sockets it' never form an eye but if God
[1:19:41] does it one time he'll see and pick his

[1:22:37] your token it's the only access we have
[1:22:39] to God it's the only access we have to
[1:22:41] the blessings of God when you go to pray
[1:22:43] to God and you want the Lord to answer
[1:22:45] your prayer that's the only way you'll
[1:22:46] ever get God to answer your prayer is to
[1:22:48] have the token and apply it with the
[1:22:49] prayer it's our payment it's the very
[1:22:51] thing that God has given us as a body of
[1:22:53] Believers as the Bride of Jesus Christ
[1:22:55] it's the answer to every question if you
[1:22:57] the healing that we need in our body
[1:22:59] it's the answer salvation it's our body
[1:23:01] brother Mark the very or it's the answer
[1:23:03] in order for us to even make a Rapture
[1:23:04] it's the only way we'll ever make a
[1:23:07] Rapture said it's our token it's the
[1:23:09] spirit of God he says so then when you
[1:23:12] pray you must have the token and present
[1:23:14] the token with your prayer it's the holy
[1:23:16] spirit it's the it's the portion that
[1:23:18] God gave you it's where God broke
[1:23:20] himself off in the in the upper room
[1:23:22] remember he poured out upon them the
[1:23:23] little licks of fire he sent his Spirit
[1:23:25] to dwell in the heart of men he say see
[1:23:28] it's your token he said so when you pray
[1:23:31] you must have the token and present it
[1:23:32] with your prayers and say now I believe
[1:23:35] he said I now believe for ourself and
[1:23:37] apply the token to the whole family just
[1:23:39] like they did whenever whenever Paul uh
[1:23:42] told the Roman Centurion believe thou
[1:23:44] and all of thy house shall be saved he
[1:23:47] said apply it to your family if you have
[1:23:49] an unsaved child lay the token right on
[1:23:51] top of him and say Lord God I claim him
[1:23:54] in the name of Jesus Christ and you stay
[1:23:56] right there if you got a mother or a
[1:23:57] loved one that's lost lay the token on
[1:23:59] them and say Lord God I claim them it's
[1:24:01] our token for the mark that your life is
[1:24:04] a holy life it's the very thing that God
[1:24:06] has given as a Vindication that he has
[1:24:08] accepted you as a Believer he said you
[1:24:10] take that token and you apply it to
[1:24:12] every request that you have you wonder
[1:24:14] why people go around and wonder if God
[1:24:16] even hears them and don't answer their
[1:24:18] prayer and they can't even hardly pray
[1:24:19] enough to God to even can even hear what
[1:24:22] they're saying but brother Mark but God
[1:24:23] has given us a token to
[1:24:26] apply he said live a life live a life
[1:24:29] that is worthy of the gospel live a life
[1:24:31] that is Holy live a life where where you
[1:24:33] can have the token of God upon your life
[1:24:35] and then you can take that token and use
[1:24:37] it it is there just to take up space
[1:24:39] it's made there to be used he said but
[1:24:41] we've got to use it take our token and
[1:24:43] lay it upon those that are lost and say
[1:24:45] Lord God I claim it friends let me tell
[1:24:46] you it don't matter what your need is
[1:24:48] this morning if you'll take the token
[1:24:49] that God has given you and lay it upon
[1:24:51] your knee that's where God will answer
[1:24:53] your prayer he said that's what we have
[1:24:55] to do we have to move out of all the
[1:24:56] worldly trash we have to move it out of
[1:24:58] our house and get ready where God can
[1:25:00] move we have to burn up our shorts and
[1:25:02] throw away your C tables and get rid of
[1:25:04] your cigarettes and dump your unbelief
[1:25:06] and all your church papers in the trash
[1:25:08] cam where they belong then you're
[1:25:10] getting ready and then what do you do
[1:25:12] you apply the token in prayer with a
[1:25:14] real evidence and a real faith and you
[1:25:16] apply it with confidence and when you
[1:25:18] apply the token you know you're cleaned
[1:25:20] up and then the scripture must be
[1:25:22] fulfilled for the Bible says if our
[1:25:24] hearts condemn us not then we shall have
[1:25:26] our
[1:25:28] request see when the token is applied to
[1:25:30] your life then you shall have your
[1:25:32] request see you realize friends that
[1:25:34] it's God's desire to give you my I feel
[1:25:37] the presence of the Lord this morning
[1:25:38] it's God's desire to give you the
[1:25:40] desires of your heart how many knows
[1:25:42] that God's desire is to give you the
[1:25:44] desires of your heart he said it in his
[1:25:46] word he wants you to have what you want
[1:25:48] to have but God wants to change your
[1:25:51] desire right mark his desire is to Grant
[1:25:54] your request but it takes a commitment
[1:25:56] from you it takes a life from you it
[1:25:59] takes a real commitment to be a to be a
[1:26:01] believer and to be a and to be a servant
[1:26:04] of the Lord and a real commitment he'll
[1:26:06] Grant you request he wants to but it'll
[1:26:08] take your commitment he wants to give to
[1:26:10] you but it'll take your commitment he
[1:26:12] wants to pour all the the the the
[1:26:14] blessings and the and the the joy of
[1:26:16] Heaven upon your life but it'll take
[1:26:17] your
[1:26:19] commitment I wonder how many here
[1:26:22] the call of God this morning and can
[1:26:24] heed to it I'm going to hurry and close
[1:26:27] just a few minutes how many hear the
[1:26:29] call of God and can heed to it how many
[1:26:31] raise your hand say I've hear heard the
[1:26:33] call of God let me heed to it God's
[1:26:35] calling at your heart think of this
[1:26:38] friends see you can't you can't come to
[1:26:40] God if you don't first hear we're
[1:26:43] talking about perfecting Holiness so if
[1:26:45] somebody told you something well maybe
[1:26:48] you didn't hear it the first time but
[1:26:49] you let the spirit of the Lord begin to
[1:26:50] move and Minister something to your your
[1:26:52] heart and then you hear it say see when
[1:26:54] you hear it you have to first hear
[1:26:55] before you can come that's what Jesus
[1:26:57] said he said every man therefore hath
[1:26:58] heard Heath learned of the father cometh
[1:27:01] unto me says so first he heard then he
[1:27:04] came what do you do when you come
[1:27:06] brother Mark is you pour your life out
[1:27:08] before God you empty out you become a an
[1:27:10] empty vessel you you take the things the
[1:27:13] the desires of the Flesh and your self-
[1:27:14] will and you pour them out before God
[1:27:16] and all the things that you know ain't
[1:27:17] wrong everything that condemns you and
[1:27:19] you poured out before God so you come
[1:27:22] you hear then you come then you give
[1:27:25] then you
[1:27:26] receive isn't that what happened to that
[1:27:28] little widow woman that day remember she
[1:27:31] was out there Gathering up sticks and
[1:27:32] here the Prophet Elijah came down where
[1:27:34] by where she was and the Bible says
[1:27:36] Elijah called unto her he said lady he
[1:27:38] said go and get a morsel of bread and
[1:27:40] come to me she heard she came she gave
[1:27:46] then she received even though she didn't
[1:27:49] have no food Brother David enough to
[1:27:50] even feed her own son and she she said
[1:27:52] that's the last meal we'll eat and we'll
[1:27:53] die but she heard and she came and she
[1:27:56] gave all that she had look what the look
[1:27:58] what she received her meal Barrel never
[1:28:00] ran dry in the midst of a famine when
[1:28:03] everybody else was starving and the
[1:28:05] people next door and all the neighbors
[1:28:07] over there and they didn't know where to
[1:28:08] turn here was a woman whose meal Barrel
[1:28:10] never ran dry you say brother Matt why
[1:28:12] did it not run dry because she heard and
[1:28:14] she came and she gave and she received
[1:28:17] friends it's a promise of God it don't
[1:28:19] matter you say well she was a poor woman
[1:28:21] God was trying to help it don't matter
[1:28:23] if you're rich or poor when you hear the
[1:28:25] call of God and you come to God and you
[1:28:27] pour everything out and you give to God
[1:28:29] you can't help but receive from
[1:28:31] God that's what happened with the queen
[1:28:33] of South she wasn't no poor lady she had
[1:28:35] everything she was a queen over the
[1:28:38] great land of the South and the Bible
[1:28:40] would tell us about her her great
[1:28:41] Kingdom and and how much she was and but
[1:28:44] you realize that this woman even though
[1:28:46] she was a queen she wasn't where God
[1:28:48] wanted her to be she had great wealth
[1:28:51] she was was respected she was a she was
[1:28:54] a great Queen had a had a great
[1:28:56] Kingdom but there was something missing
[1:28:58] in her life the Bible says listen glory
[1:29:02] to God the Bible says but she
[1:29:05] heard about
[1:29:08] Solomon she heard of Solomon she heard
[1:29:11] of this you realize that it wasn't just
[1:29:14] the it wasn't just Solomon or the riches
[1:29:16] of Solomon or the kingdom of Solomon but
[1:29:19] brother Mark what she heard actually
[1:29:20] steered the heart of a queen
[1:29:23] can you can you get in her position this
[1:29:24] morning and think of her sitting there
[1:29:26] and hearing reports and something began
[1:29:28] to steer in her heart but notice what it
[1:29:30] was she heard the Bible said in First
[1:29:31] Kings 1:1 it says she heard of the fame
[1:29:33] of Solomon concerning the name of the
[1:29:36] Lord she didn't just hear about how
[1:29:38] great Solomon was and how big a kingdom
[1:29:40] he had and how big his Palace was and
[1:29:43] how much money he had but brother Mar
[1:29:45] she heard of Solomon concerning the name
[1:29:48] of the Lord she heard about the God of
[1:29:50] Solomon she heard how he worshiped she
[1:29:54] heard how the temple was built she heard
[1:29:57] about how a king like Solomon brother
[1:29:59] Mark that would that would go down
[1:30:00] before his people as a great man but he
[1:30:03] had the humility to get down on his
[1:30:05] knees before a God that was greater a
[1:30:08] man that wasn't afraid to worship he was
[1:30:10] a he was a man that in his kingdom that
[1:30:13] that that was that was that was built
[1:30:15] just the way God wanted it brother Mark
[1:30:17] where the presence of the Lord could be
[1:30:19] there she heard about these things and
[1:30:22] she came the Bible says that she came
[1:30:24] because she heard this you remember how
[1:30:26] the the kingdom of Solomon was had to go
[1:30:28] through it remember how when the temple
[1:30:30] was built and then after the the temple
[1:30:32] was built Solomon built it just
[1:30:33] according to the way God wanted it built
[1:30:35] the things that God didn't want there
[1:30:37] Solomon put them out the things that God
[1:30:38] wanted there Solomon brought them in he
[1:30:40] built the altar just the way God wanted
[1:30:42] the altar he built he built the the
[1:30:44] candlesticks the way God wanted them he
[1:30:45] built the walls the way God wanted them
[1:30:47] he built the every part of the temple of
[1:30:49] God was built the exact way that God
[1:30:51] told Solomon to build it and after the
[1:30:53] Solomon got done building he be to turn
[1:30:56] and he be to bless God in the temple and
[1:30:58] said oh God we've done everything
[1:30:59] according to Thy word don't you see
[1:31:01] friends he put everything out he put
[1:31:03] everything that that didn't belong he
[1:31:05] put it out he made a place that God
[1:31:06] would be pleased to dwell he said God he
[1:31:08] turned and and begin to bless God we've
[1:31:10] done everything you've asked us to do
[1:31:12] you're the Creator you're the great God
[1:31:14] now here our request oh Lord God of
[1:31:17] Israel there's no God like thee in
[1:31:18] Heaven and Earth which keep as your word
[1:31:20] and you show Mercy unto your servants
[1:31:22] that walk before thee with all their
[1:31:23] hearts oh god of Israel now let Thy word
[1:31:27] be verified let you let Thy word be
[1:31:29] Vindicated that what I've done is
[1:31:31] pleasing unto thee brother Mark she
[1:31:33] heard about how Solomon had put
[1:31:35] everything out and created a place that
[1:31:37] would be pleasing to God and notice what
[1:31:39] God did he came into that Temple and he
[1:31:41] Vindicated it by the supernatural
[1:31:43] brother Mark the Bible said that out of
[1:31:45] the heavens came a fire of God that fell
[1:31:48] in the house of God and he filled the
[1:31:50] temple
[1:31:52] with the glory of God it became a place
[1:31:55] of worship a place that was filled with
[1:31:58] the spirit of God Solomon done all the
[1:32:00] work that he was supposed to do and then
[1:32:02] God heard his request and he granted it
[1:32:05] and he Vindicated it it was his work by
[1:32:07] Supernatural work in the temple I
[1:32:09] thought my isn't it something this is
[1:32:11] what the queen had heard about the
[1:32:13] blessings of God and the fire of God
[1:32:15] fallen in the temple and how that God
[1:32:17] was a god of healing and forgiveness and
[1:32:20] she had a desire
[1:32:22] for the Wesley to experience a
[1:32:24] supernatural
[1:32:25] God that's what brought the Queen of
[1:32:27] Sheba to Solomon she had a desire to see
[1:32:30] a supernatural God she no doubt she had
[1:32:33] her own Gods many gods that the world
[1:32:36] has but she had a desire to meet that
[1:32:38] God so she packed up she didn't go to
[1:32:42] criticize she didn't go to prove him
[1:32:44] wrong she didn't go so she can find
[1:32:47] something wrong with every service or
[1:32:49] find something wrong with every person
[1:32:51] but she went for one one reason to get
[1:32:52] in the presence of the king she heard of
[1:32:55] the famous Solomon concerning the name
[1:32:57] of the Lord she went to see for herself
[1:33:01] amen and the Bible says when she came
[1:33:02] brother Mark she didn't go empty-handed
[1:33:04] glory to God she didn't go empty-handed
[1:33:07] she filled up her camel trains with gold
[1:33:10] and spices and precious stones and she
[1:33:12] went to Solomon and brother Mark when
[1:33:14] she came to Solomon in the presence of
[1:33:16] Solomon notice what she saw the Bible
[1:33:18] says she saw Solomon's wisdom she saw
[1:33:21] the house that he built she saw the meat
[1:33:24] on his table the way his servant sat
[1:33:27] see saw the the attendants of his
[1:33:30] ministers saw their apparel what they
[1:33:32] were wearing she saw the cup bearers she
[1:33:35] saw even the ascent the way they went
[1:33:38] into and exited the
[1:33:40] temple it was a holy place she saw this
[1:33:44] Brother David the Bible says think of it
[1:33:46] even the way that even the way they went
[1:33:49] into the house of God is't it something
[1:33:52] what she saw Solomon had to built it in
[1:33:55] a way that was pleasing to God that's
[1:33:57] what we we try to do here we want to
[1:33:59] build a place that is pleasing to God
[1:34:02] that whenever somebody would come in
[1:34:03] that they would see even the way the
[1:34:05] children walk into the house of God
[1:34:07] there's something about it they don't
[1:34:09] they don't they're not coming in to
[1:34:10] disrupt service people aren't sitting
[1:34:12] around and just talking like the world
[1:34:13] has made the the churches today where
[1:34:15] they're just a big a place of talking
[1:34:18] and and drinking coffee in the sanctuary
[1:34:20] and talking to one another you said well
[1:34:21] we would never do that but but people
[1:34:23] they just make a mockery out of the
[1:34:25] sanctuary of God and eating candy and
[1:34:27] drinking sodas and and chewing bubble
[1:34:29] gum and just a it's just a big joke to
[1:34:31] even be in the house of God there ain't
[1:34:32] nothing consecrated to God but in the
[1:34:34] temple of Solomon it wasn't that way and
[1:34:36] the queen recognized it it was a place
[1:34:39] that was dedicated to God it wasn't a
[1:34:42] place there wasn't people in there
[1:34:43] having picnics for their kids yeah let
[1:34:44] me tell you what I think happened if the
[1:34:46] kids got hungry I think the masama
[1:34:48] kindly got the little children and they
[1:34:49] took them back to the nursery and sh
[1:34:51] they fed them there it was a designated
[1:34:53] place outside cuz this was a designated
[1:34:55] place for something else it wasn't a
[1:34:57] picnic ground it was the temple of God
[1:34:59] and she saw it and she recognized it and
[1:35:02] she desired to have the god that Solomon
[1:35:05] served the Bible says when she saw it
[1:35:08] there was no more spirit in her she saw
[1:35:11] you say what did she see she saw the
[1:35:13] Holiness of Solomon's house it was a
[1:35:16] holy place she saw the Holiness in there
[1:35:19] the in in his life and in the Temple and
[1:35:22] but the mark the Bible says in her
[1:35:23] spirit was no more in her isn't it
[1:35:26] something the very every doubt every
[1:35:29] question the very question that maybe
[1:35:31] you had on your mind if you come to the
[1:35:33] house of God this morning I wonder what
[1:35:35] kind of place it really is but when she
[1:35:37] came her spirit left her all the
[1:35:41] questions the unbelief the doubt all the
[1:35:43] holdbacks left that was the moment it
[1:35:46] was this very moment that all of it left
[1:35:49] and she relaxed in the presence of the
[1:35:51] Lord Lord and she said it was true the
[1:35:54] report that I heard in my own land of
[1:35:57] your acts and your wisdom it was true I
[1:35:59] heard a report how you conducted the
[1:36:01] services and how you acted and how your
[1:36:04] people were and but I believe not the
[1:36:07] words until I came and now I've seen it
[1:36:09] with my own eyes myness something
[1:36:12] Brother David in the presence of the
[1:36:13] king that her eyes opened up she
[1:36:16] recognized where she was brother B says
[1:36:18] she seen something real for the first
[1:36:20] time in her life
[1:36:22] it was something that was genuine it
[1:36:24] wasn't put on she seen something that
[1:36:26] come from God that man that man couldn't
[1:36:29] have the wisdom of himself he couldn't
[1:36:32] even have that wisdom of himself to know
[1:36:34] the secrets of hearts and reveal but he
[1:36:36] was a a prophet he couldn't even
[1:36:38] understand it and tell it it had to be
[1:36:39] god notice what she said she said
[1:36:41] blessed be the Lord God which delighted
[1:36:44] in thee and set thee on the throne of
[1:36:45] Israel and the Bible says after she saw
[1:36:47] this she took what she had and she gave
[1:36:50] it to Solomon she took the almug trees
[1:36:53] let me tell you what God does with what
[1:36:55] you giving see each one of us have
[1:36:57] something we can give to God maybe it's
[1:36:58] something that that that Alma tree was a
[1:37:00] blessing that came upon her life it's
[1:37:02] something that God had gave her in her
[1:37:03] kingdom each one of us have things in
[1:37:05] our life we could give to God we give
[1:37:07] gifts in our life we could give to God
[1:37:10] you know what she did Brother David she
[1:37:11] took the alma trees and she gave them
[1:37:13] but you notice Solomon didn't look at
[1:37:15] him and say well we don't want that kind
[1:37:16] of stuff in our we don't we we don't
[1:37:18] want your kind but the Bible says he
[1:37:20] took the gift that she gave and he used
[1:37:22] it he took it in the temple of the Lord
[1:37:24] and he built pillars in the temple of
[1:37:26] God with the Alma trees that came from
[1:37:27] the Queen of Sheba I thought here she
[1:37:29] was it came from some other place that
[1:37:31] she wasn't even an Israelite brother
[1:37:33] Mark this this Gentile woman from some
[1:37:35] other place way off but here he would
[1:37:37] take what she gave him and he built a
[1:37:39] temple or or built a column in the house
[1:37:42] of God but isn't it something that God
[1:37:44] would use what you give him he'll use
[1:37:46] the gifts that you have and she gave
[1:37:48] them and God used them but the Bible
[1:37:50] says then after he used them this is the
[1:37:52] best part but Jared the king of Solomon
[1:37:54] gave to the queen of the Sheba all of
[1:37:57] her desire whatever she asked for
[1:38:00] Solomon gave to her she came she heard
[1:38:03] she came she gave and then she received
[1:38:07] she gave everything she had isn't it
[1:38:09] something she poured her heart out this
[1:38:11] is what God's doing he's calling us
[1:38:12] brother Mah to hear the message of the
[1:38:15] hour he's calling you to come to the
[1:38:16] word of God he's calling you to pour out
[1:38:18] your life and and give up the the flesh
[1:38:21] and all these things of the Flesh and to
[1:38:23] receive the very life of God she
[1:38:26] received blessings the Bible says
[1:38:28] Solomon gave her the very desire desires
[1:38:30] of her heart and he gave her of his
[1:38:32] Royal Bounty I don't know about you but
[1:38:34] there's something in this little boy
[1:38:35] that would like to receive the Royal
[1:38:37] Bounty I don't know what all it consists
[1:38:39] of but God I want all of it that just
[1:38:40] sounds good to me I want the Royal
[1:38:42] Bounty I I want I want what the King has
[1:38:45] friends isn't it something to hear she
[1:38:46] would come to receive from an Earthly
[1:38:48] King but we come to receive from a
[1:38:50] Heavenly King she heard and she came and
[1:38:53] she gave and she received friends I
[1:38:55] think that's what we ought to do this
[1:38:56] morning as I'm closing we ought to
[1:38:57] follow the pattern of the Queen of Sheba
[1:39:00] she heard and she came she gave and she
[1:39:03] received friends it wasn't very long ago
[1:39:05] there was another woman that was in
[1:39:06] brother B's meetings by the name of hady
[1:39:08] R let me tell you what she did she heard
[1:39:10] the message of the hour and she came to
[1:39:12] it and she gave to it and then one day
[1:39:15] when it came her appointed time she
[1:39:17] received her blessing from God that's
[1:39:18] the pattern that God has called us to in
[1:39:20] this
[1:39:21] age and the Bible says that that Queen
[1:39:24] will raise up in judgment against this
[1:39:26] generation because they've received more
[1:39:28] than she has they've saw more than she
[1:39:30] ever saw she saw the wisdom of Solomon
[1:39:33] she saw the wisdom of an Earthly King
[1:39:35] but Jesus said but a greater than
[1:39:37] Solomon is here you seemen more
[1:39:39] Supernatural in this age than the Queen
[1:39:40] of Sheba ever saw he said that's why
[1:39:42] she'll raise up in judgment against this
[1:39:44] generation friends let me tell you she
[1:39:46] was drawn to an Earthly King but we've
[1:39:48] been drawn to the King of Kings we've
[1:39:51] heard we've came yes we've gave now we
[1:39:55] receive as a music players want to come
[1:39:57] may you stand to your feet this
[1:39:58] morning the ram said here's what's
[1:40:00] happening isn't this something that God
[1:40:03] just gives us so many blessings he
[1:40:05] answers our request sister Tammy told me
[1:40:08] a a testimony the other day she said she
[1:40:11] was sitting in service going through
[1:40:12] through some things driving down the
[1:40:13] road she said Lord she got to sing in
[1:40:16] that song because he lived she walked
[1:40:17] down the service she said I just pray
[1:40:19] that that that brother will sing that
[1:40:22] tonight I pray that he'll sing Because
[1:40:24] He Lives I Can Face Tomorrow Lord then
[1:40:25] I'll know everything's going to be
[1:40:27] okay well she didn't know I was going to
[1:40:30] lead songs neither did I but so happened
[1:40:32] brother Mark had made an AC of bad
[1:40:37] discretion so he was injured so brother
[1:40:40] Matt had to lead the songs I came out
[1:40:42] and I had all had all the songs to sing
[1:40:46] well guess what because he lives wasn't
[1:40:47] on there but the sister's sitting in the
[1:40:49] service and she hasn't this on our heart
[1:40:51] Lord can you let them sing it just so I
[1:40:53] know everything's going to be
[1:40:55] okay and I got to that next song brother
[1:40:57] Mark I gave brother Mark the list of
[1:40:59] songs after the church when they told me
[1:41:00] that I said well that wasn't on this
[1:41:02] list and in the place of the one I I
[1:41:05] started to sing it and all of a sudden
[1:41:06] the spirit of the Lord just moved on me
[1:41:08] I said you know Because He Lives I Can
[1:41:11] Face Tomorrow he's our God he ain't
[1:41:14] never forsaken us more that all of a
[1:41:15] sudden the spirit of the Lord begin to
[1:41:16] move in the church how many was here
[1:41:17] that night and just the power of God
[1:41:19] begin to move just from the of a song
[1:41:22] why because it was God answering a
[1:41:24] request of a woman that heard came and
[1:41:30] gave see there's a time to to hear time
[1:41:33] to come time to give a time to receive
[1:41:37] he's called us to an act of Holiness he
[1:41:40] called us to a work but Mark there's
[1:41:41] something special that's happening in
[1:41:43] this world today but R said see the
[1:41:45] world don't recognize it he said they
[1:41:47] they can't accept what's being done
[1:41:49] right now that's all you hear fast and
[1:41:50] pray pray we're going to have a great
[1:41:51] breaking of the day there's a great
[1:41:53] thing that's about to happen pray pray
[1:41:55] pray we're not too late yet he said why
[1:41:58] do they do that because they want a
[1:42:00] Great Awakening they want a great move
[1:42:02] of God this is why people calling out
[1:42:04] pray pray pray God's going to do
[1:42:05] something they're crying out believing
[1:42:07] that there will be an Awakening they're
[1:42:08] good people but why is it he said but
[1:42:10] notice what they have done they have not
[1:42:12] recognized The Awakening of the Bride
[1:42:15] see by being a Christian they feel the
[1:42:17] pull of the hour but they haven't
[1:42:19] recognized what's been done listen for
[1:42:21] that's what's making them feel that way
[1:42:23] they know something is supposed to
[1:42:25] happen but see they're looking for it
[1:42:27] way off in the future to come when it's
[1:42:29] already happened right by you that's the
[1:42:32] same thing they did in the old days they
[1:42:33] was believing in the coming of Messiah
[1:42:35] they believed there would be a
[1:42:36] forerunner come but it would be but it
[1:42:38] was right by them and they didn't know
[1:42:39] it they didn't recognize it they
[1:42:41] believed there would be a forerunner
[1:42:42] that would forerun the Messiah but then
[1:42:43] they cut off his head and they killed
[1:42:45] the
[1:42:46] Messiah it was happening right by them
[1:42:48] because the Bible says they'll be
[1:42:50] blinded and wouldn't see it they're
[1:42:52] waiting for a Great Awakening but we're
[1:42:54] living in it how many's heard it how
[1:42:57] many's heard the call and how many has
[1:42:59] came responded to the call of God let me
[1:43:02] invite you this morning to pour
[1:43:03] everything out of your life be a holy
