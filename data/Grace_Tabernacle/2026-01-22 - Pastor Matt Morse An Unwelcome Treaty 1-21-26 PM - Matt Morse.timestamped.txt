[22:15] So many times we go to church and sit
[22:18] there on a pew. Some of us believe
[22:21] that's all that we're supposed to do. I
[22:24] made up my mind when I came through the
[22:28] door.
[22:29] I've got something to praise God for.
[22:34] Well, I'm a bloodbought child of the
[22:38] king. My sins are gone and I've been
[22:42] redeemed. I lift up the name of the
[22:46] Lord. I adore.
[22:48] I've got something to praise God for.
[22:59] Now, Satan tries to tell us that it's
[23:02] wrong to lift our hands. Get your mind
[23:05] determined that you're going to take a
[23:07] stand. If you got what I've got, you're
[23:10] not ashamed anymore.
[23:13] I've got something to praise God for.
[23:18] Well, I'm a bloodbought child of King.
[23:23] My sins are old and I've been redeemed.
[23:28] I lift up the name of the one I adore.
[23:33] I've got something to praise God for.
[23:38] Well, I'm a bloodbought child of King.
[23:43] Well, my sins are gone and I've been
[23:46] redeemed. I lift up the name of one I
[23:51] adore.
[23:52] I've got something to praise God for.
[23:57] I lift up the name of one I adore.
[24:06] I've got something to praise God for.
[24:42] I had a Oh
[24:59] myst.
[25:06] myself for time.
[25:11] And every bridge is crossed and burned.
[25:15] But through all the wreckage I had
[25:17] learned, there is one thing that I can
[25:22] never lose.
[25:26] If I got Jesus
[25:29] and I got all that I could ever need.
[25:34] Take the world away from me and I'll be
[25:38] okay if I got Jesus.
[25:44] And there's a hope that's living deep
[25:47] inside. A joy that I could never hide
[25:51] and a safe place to fall. If I got
[25:55] Jesus,
[25:57] then I got it all.
[26:01] And I've seen weaknesses turn to
[26:04] strength. And I've seen failures made
[26:07] with grace. And it's not from what I've
[26:11] done. It's Christ in me.
[26:16] A miracle I can't explain.
[26:19] Oh, he's g me his name. I'm the richest
[26:24] girl that I could ever be.
[26:30] If I got Jesus
[26:33] and I got all that I could ever be. Take
[26:38] the world away from me and I'll be okay
[26:44] if I got Jesus.
[26:48] And there's a hope that's living deep
[26:51] inside. A joy that I could never hide in
[26:55] a safe place to fall. If I got Jesus,
[27:01] I've got it all.
[27:06] And someday that trumpet's going to
[27:09] sound.
[27:13] And the king of heaven ride upon the
[27:16] clouds are coming down.
[27:20] And I'll hit my knees. Oh Lord, that
[27:23] sings my soul.
[27:26] I'm going home.
[27:30] If I got Jesus,
[27:34] I've got all that I could ever need.
[27:38] Take the world away from me and I'll be
[27:43] okay. If I got Jesus
[27:48] and there's a hope that's living deep
[27:51] inside, a joy that I could never hide
[27:55] and a safe place of hope. If I got
[27:59] Jesus,
[28:01] I've got it all.
[28:05] If I got Jesus,
[28:09] I've got it all.

[28:54] bow before
[28:56] your throne.
[29:01] All the elers
[29:04] cast their crowns before the lamb
[29:09] of God and sing.

[39:23] Jesus. Amen. I think we have a right as
[39:26] believers to speak his name. Amen. Amen.
[39:29] How many come tonight gathering in the
[39:32] name of Jesus? Amen. What a privilege it
[39:34] is to know him. Amen. I know many are
[39:38] sick tonight that would ask us to speak
[39:40] that holy name over their life. Amen.
[39:43] and brother Brian Hatfield is sick this
[39:47] evening. Also, Destiny is sick. Also,
[39:51] Brother Silvin, Sister Lena,
[39:54] not feeling well. They're still on the
[39:56] service. Just asking the church to pray
[39:58] for them. And I know that God is
[40:00] certainly mindful, amen, of everyone, no
[40:02] matter where we are, amen, and what our
[40:05] condition is. And maybe you have a need
[40:07] on your heart tonight. You just lift
[40:08] your hand to the Lord and ask him to
[40:11] come. And Lord, as we speak thy name,
[40:13] would you come and meet every need?
[40:14] Amen. Let's just bow our heads together.
[40:17] Gracious heavenly father, Lord, what a
[40:19] privilege it is, Lord, to have a name
[40:22] that has more power, Lord, than anything
[40:25] that we could create in this natural
[40:27] life. Lord, you've given us the ability,
[40:30] Lord, by faith to speak the name of
[40:32] Jesus over every situation, over every
[40:36] problem, over every sickness, every
[40:38] home, every family, Lord. Lord, and we
[40:41] do that tonight, Lord. We call upon thy
[40:43] name, Lord, knowing that we don't have
[40:45] the ability, Lord, to heal or to save or
[40:48] deliver, but Lord, in the name of Jesus,
[40:51] all thy work shall be done. And Lord, we
[40:54] just ask you tonight, Lord, that you
[40:55] would heal each one, everyone that's
[40:57] sick and body. Lord, I pray that this
[40:59] revival, Lord, that is steering in the
[41:01] hearts of the believers tonight, Lord, I
[41:03] I pray, Lord, that it would it would
[41:05] just resonate through this building.
[41:08] Lord, I pray Lord that it would waken
[41:10] such a supernatural, Lord, among the
[41:12] church tonight, Lord. God, that we would
[41:14] go from this place declaring that we've
[41:16] been in the presence of the Holy Ghost.
[41:18] Lord, we thank you, Lord, for all that
[41:20] you do. Lord, we thank you for your
[41:21] spirit being with us on this Wednesday
[41:23] night. Lord, we just ask you to take
[41:25] this word and you would anoint it to the
[41:27] hearers of the word, Lord. May something
[41:29] be said, Lord, that would be edifying to
[41:31] the body of Christ. God, I just ask that
[41:33] you would help me to get out of the way,
[41:34] Lord. God, knowing I don't have the
[41:36] ability to be able to help anybody. But
[41:38] Lord, if you could just come tonight,
[41:40] Lord, we give you the liberty, Lord, to
[41:42] speak and Lord, the uh the liberty,
[41:44] Lord, to to work with each one of us,
[41:46] Lord, we pray now to have your way in
[41:48] Jesus name. And we'll give you the glory
[41:50] in all things. In Jesus name we pray.
[41:53] And the church says, "Amen."
[41:56] Amen. You love the Lord tonight. Amen.
[41:59] Just turn around and greet somebody in
[42:00] the name of the Lord. And amen. Just
[42:02] certainly a privilege. Amen. and to be

[42:07] of God tonight and Amen. and just a uh
[42:11] uh just an honor. Amen. To be able to to
[42:16] um just to stand with the saints of God
[42:18] and

[42:31] Amen. Amen. Sure appreciate our
[42:34] brothers. Amen. Help each other out.
[42:35] Amen. You love the Lord tonight. Amen.
[42:37] Want to welcome each one here and just
[42:39] make a special welcome to Sister
[42:41] Jennifer and her and her family. And
[42:44] they've made our our church here their
[42:46] home place of fellowship. Mother Joel.
[42:49] And so we just want to give them a a
[42:50] warm grace tabernacle welcome uh
[42:53] tonight. And
[42:55] Amen.
[42:59] Amen. Some of you, many of you that may
[43:01] not know Sister Jennifer, and she she
[43:04] she's not she's kind of shy, but won't
[43:07] mind you come up and introduce yourself
[43:09] and just a great part of our family. And
[43:12] uh certainly uh she has one of the
[43:15] greatest testimonies of any godfearing
[43:18] woman that I've ever known. And I I've
[43:20] often I've told her uh before if she
[43:22] would write a book of her testimony that
[43:24] would it'd be read around the world. and
[43:26] uh she she's certainly uh been a real uh
[43:30] testimony of what it is to be a daughter
[43:32] of God and uh and it's an honor uh to be
[43:35] able to have them here. So I just say
[43:37] God bless you tonight. I want to invite
[43:40] you to the scripture uh to the second
[43:43] book of Chronicles and we're going to
[43:44] read out of the 18th chapter and we'll
[43:47] start in the first verse and uh read a
[43:49] few verses of scripture and and uh we'll
[43:52] read down to the 13th verse. So 2
[43:55] Chronicles the 18th chapter and the
[43:57] first verse. We'll give you just a
[43:59] moment uh to turn there and the Lord
[44:02] just put this on my heart this uh this
[44:04] morning and so I just want to uh be
[44:06] obedient to the Lord. Amen. Amen. How
[44:08] many wants that? Amen. All right. The
[44:11] first chapter or 18th chapter first
[44:14] verse Bible says very familiar story.
[44:16] Now Jehoshaphat had riches and honor and
[44:19] abundance and joined affinity with Ahab.
[44:22] And after certain years he went down to
[44:24] Ahab to Samaria. And Ahab killed sheep
[44:27] and oxen for him in abundance and for
[44:29] the people that they had uh with him and
[44:32] persuaded him to go up with him to
[44:34] Rayoth Gilead. And Ahab the king of
[44:36] Israel said to Jehoshaphat the king of
[44:39] Judah, "Will thou go with me to
[44:40] Ramothgilead?" And he answered him, "I
[44:43] am as thou art, and my people is thy
[44:45] people, and we will be with thee in
[44:46] war." And Jehoshaphat said unto the king
[44:49] of Israel, inquire, remember, this is a
[44:51] divided nation. and the the the kingdom
[44:53] of Judah and the kingdom of Israel. It
[44:55] was after the kingdom had been divided.
[44:57] So they had two separate kings. So he
[44:59] asked him, the king of Israel, he said,
[45:01] I inquire, I pray thee, at the word of
[45:03] the Lord today. Therefore the king of
[45:05] Israel, which was Ahab, gathered
[45:07] together the prophets, 400 men, and said
[45:09] unto them, shall we go to Ramoth Gilead
[45:11] to battle, or shall I forbear? And they
[45:13] said, Go up, for the God will deliver,
[45:14] for God will deliver unto the king's
[45:16] hand. But Jehoshaphat said, "Is there
[45:19] not here a prophet of the Lord besides
[45:21] that we might inquire of him?" And the
[45:24] king of Israel said unto Jehoshaphat,
[45:26] "There is yet one man by whom we may
[45:28] inquire of the Lord, but I hate him, for
[45:30] he never prophesies good unto me, but he
[45:33] always prophesies evil. His name is
[45:35] Micaiah. He's the son of of Imlaw." And
[45:38] Jehoshaphat said, "Well, let not the
[45:40] king say so." In other words, invite
[45:42] him. And the king of Israel called for
[45:44] one of his officers and said, "Fetch
[45:46] quickly Micaiah the son of Imla and the
[45:48] king of Israel, Jehoshap and Jehoshaphat
[45:50] the king of Judah set either one of them
[45:52] on his throne. They were clothed in
[45:54] their robes and they sat in a void place
[45:56] at the entering in of the gate of
[45:59] Samaria. And all the prophets prophesied
[46:01] before them." And here uh at the
[46:04] entering of the gate, this was a place
[46:05] where a lot of uh judgments were made.
[46:08] Maybe on a threshing floor. they would
[46:10] do the threshing floor at the beginning
[46:12] of the city. In other it was just a
[46:13] place that was big enough outside that
[46:15] everyone would be able uh uh to be a
[46:17] part or to see what was taking place. So
[46:19] they sat in this place and the prophets
[46:22] prophesied saying go up to Ramothgilead
[46:24] and prosper for the Lord shall deliver
[46:25] it under the hand of the king. And the
[46:27] messenger went to call Micaiah and he
[46:31] spake to him. So here they are on their
[46:32] way back and he spake to him. He said,
[46:34] "Behold the words of the prophets. They
[46:37] declare good to the king and they're all
[46:39] with one ascent. In other words, they're
[46:41] all in one mind and they're all in one
[46:42] accord. There there's great uh there's
[46:45] great unity in the kingdom. Everybody
[46:47] has came together. They're all saying
[46:48] the same thing. So let thy word I pray
[46:51] thee be just like theirs and just speak
[46:54] good. And Micaiah said, "As the Lord
[46:56] liveth, even what my God saith, that
[46:59] will I speak." And I'll just ask the
[47:02] Lord to add his blessing to the reading
[47:03] of the word tonight. As you take your
[47:05] seats, I would like to speak on this uh
[47:07] if we could have a title on an unwelcome
[47:10] treaty. An unwelcome treaty.
[47:13] A treaty, of course, we are familiar is
[47:17] a negotiated agreement between two
[47:19] parties. It brings a peace and a unity
[47:22] between uh uh two uh two different uh uh
[47:25] uh groups of people. It means to be
[47:27] united uh to be made one, to be combined
[47:30] or to be uh in agreement. It's the
[47:33] bringing together of two and in any
[47:35] proper treaty it's one uh that would
[47:38] find a weakness in another and have
[47:40] something to offer that would satisfy or
[47:43] sustain them in that weakness. So uh
[47:45] that's why there would be a treaty. They
[47:47] had a weak part and I had something
[47:48] strong enough to help in that area and
[47:50] maybe I had a weakness but they had a
[47:52] strength in that area. So a a treaty is
[47:55] in other words it's a way to fulfill one
[47:57] another and to grow and and work
[47:59] together and to be in unity. And you
[48:01] know, I want to say this as we're uh uh
[48:03] lay a foundation into this thought that
[48:06] uh I believe that unity means a lot to
[48:08] God. How many believe that? Say amen. I
[48:10] How many believe that? Say amen. You
[48:11] see, I believe that unity means a lot to
[48:13] God. In so much that David would even
[48:15] write in Psalms 133, he said, "Behold,
[48:17] how good and how pleasant it is for
[48:19] brethren to dwell together in unity." Uh
[48:22] in in other words, to that that that
[48:25] it's a great thing to God. And and so uh
[48:27] uh unity it means to unite two things.
[48:30] And it brings two things together. And
[48:32] uh and we realize that whenever you
[48:34] unite two things, this is something I
[48:36] want to lay in as a foundation that
[48:38] anytime you unite two things, there's
[48:40] always a product of that uniting. So
[48:43] anytime two things are pro brought
[48:45] together, it's going to it's going to
[48:46] have a product. It's going to have have
[48:48] a result. And so uh even so much that
[48:50] David when he would talk about unity, he
[48:53] he would say that it was like it was an
[48:55] odd type that he used. He said, "But
[48:56] unity, it's good and pleasant to dwell
[48:58] in unity. It's like the precious
[49:00] ointment upon the head that ran down
[49:02] upon the beard, even Aaron's beard. And
[49:04] you know, many would read this and it
[49:06] seems as an odd analogy that he would
[49:08] say unity means so much to God. It's
[49:11] like the oil that ran down Aaron's
[49:13] beard. It's kind of an odd analogy uh to
[49:16] think that that was speaking of unity.
[49:17] But uh if you ever read over in Exodus
[49:20] the 30th chapter, uh the Bible tells us
[49:22] how this anointing oil was being made
[49:25] and how that God was getting prepared to
[49:27] anoint the sanctuary and anoint Aaron
[49:29] and the priest and anoint them in
[49:31] office. And the Bible says the Lord
[49:33] spake to Moses and he said, "Take
[49:34] principal spices of myrrh and and sweet
[49:37] cinnamon and and uh calamus and and
[49:40] cassia and and and olive oil and take
[49:43] all of these things together and make an
[49:46] oil of a holy ointment, an ointment
[49:48] compound after the art of the
[49:50] apothecary." And God gives an exact
[49:52] y'all heard me use this before, but uh
[49:54] God gives an exact part just a portion
[49:57] of this. 500 shekels of sweet cinnamon,
[49:59] 250 shekels of calamus, and he gives an
[50:02] ingredient in order uh to make this uh
[50:04] anointing oil or this ointment. He said,
[50:06] "And after take it after the art of the
[50:08] apothecary, and it shall be a holy
[50:10] anointing oil, and thou shalt anoint the
[50:12] tabernacle of the congregation with it,
[50:14] and the ark of the testimony, the table,
[50:17] and the vessels, and the candlesticks,
[50:19] all the things that God had prepared in
[50:21] the tabernacle." He had given uh Moses
[50:24] an exact instruction of how to build an
[50:27] anointing oil or an ointment to be able
[50:29] to anoint those things so that it would
[50:31] be pleasing unto God. And they they
[50:32] anointed the altar of the burnt
[50:34] offering. They anointed the vessels.
[50:36] They anointed the uh from the lav to the
[50:38] foot of the lav. They sanctified uh
[50:40] everything uh that was in the sanctuary.
[50:43] And God told them whatever you anoint
[50:45] with that oil will be holy unto God. And
[50:48] even don't just stop with the things
[50:50] that are in the tabernacle. Don't just
[50:52] uh anoint the uh uh all the parts. It
[50:54] didn't matter what part it was. If it
[50:56] was the cord, it was the cable, it was
[50:57] the wall, it was the table, every part
[51:00] of it was anointed to make it a holy
[51:02] place for God. But then anybody that
[51:04] would enter into that place would have
[51:06] to have that same anointing. So he said,
[51:08] "Now go anoint Aaron and Aaron's sons so
[51:10] that when they come into this place that
[51:12] they may minister unto me in the
[51:14] priest's office, and thou shall speak
[51:16] unto the children of Israel, saying that
[51:18] this shall be a holy anointing oil unto
[51:21] me throughout your generations." So, so
[51:24] here it's it's a wonder that David uses
[51:26] this type of of analogy to describe the
[51:29] unity amongst the brethren because he's
[51:32] talking about an oil that God used all
[51:34] of these different ingredients and uh in
[51:36] each one, you know, I think about
[51:38] reading them that uh we wouldn't have
[51:40] time tonight, but every one of them have
[51:41] a different meaning. Some of you that
[51:43] knows about oils and spices, they uh
[51:45] would know a lot more than I would, but
[51:47] they they they have a different meaning.
[51:49] You would take an olive oil. They each
[51:51] one uh you say it like this brother Mark
[51:54] they have they all have their own
[51:55] identity right. So you could take an
[51:57] olive oil which was used for centuries.
[51:59] It was used for preparing food. It was
[52:01] used to to put in lamps even to to burn
[52:04] the oil or you know in the oil lamps. Uh
[52:07] it was even sometimes used for medicine
[52:09] or you can take cinnamon that was uh
[52:11] that comes from the bark of a cinnamon
[52:12] tree. I always thought that was
[52:13] fascinating how they took out the outer
[52:15] layer of the bark and then carved in
[52:17] that second layer and rolled it up and
[52:18] let it dry out and had a big long stick
[52:20] of cinnamon, cut it up in little pieces
[52:22] and and uh and I I always love cinnamon
[52:26] and uh but but but they each had their
[52:28] own identity. It comes from a cinnamon
[52:30] tree or casia which is uh which we call
[52:33] it today Chinese cinnamon which is
[52:35] mostly what we buy in the store uh in
[52:37] the place of cinnamon but uh but or even
[52:40] myrrh. Myrrh was a gum resin. It was
[52:42] used in ancient Egypt as an embalming
[52:44] fluid. It had a it had a that's why it
[52:46] was always associated with death. And it
[52:48] had a a certain uh uh scent. It was even
[52:51] at times used as an antiseptic. And uh
[52:54] so a calamus calamus was a reed that was
[52:57] uh that was like a sweet reed like a
[52:59] sweet cane that we would see uh that
[53:01] that's used and after it's dried out and
[53:03] shaved into a spice. So uh so you can
[53:06] see that every one of these ingredients,
[53:08] brother Mark, they all had their own
[53:10] identity. They were all used for
[53:11] different things. They were they were
[53:13] some come from different parts of the
[53:15] world. They weren't even all native to
[53:17] the same place. And so uh and so all of
[53:19] these were different. But through the
[53:21] process of the apothecary, they were
[53:24] they were brought together and they took
[53:26] on a new identity. So no longer was the
[53:29] cinnamon cinnamon, no longer was the
[53:30] cassia cassia, no one longer was the
[53:33] myrrh merb, but God said, "You take it
[53:35] to the art of the apothecary and let the
[53:37] apothecary do his work." He was the He
[53:39] was the medicine man. He He was the one
[53:41] that could blend it together and run it
[53:43] through and boil what needed to be
[53:44] boiled and and let it drip out the what
[53:47] needed to run through the drip and uh to
[53:49] be able to make this oil and said so so
[53:51] but when it came out of the apothecary
[53:53] it had its own identity and what the
[53:55] what the Lord said it would be. He said
[53:57] it shall be a holy anointing oil unto me
[54:01] throughout your generation. So I
[54:03] thought, isn't it something that one
[54:04] before it went through the apothecary,
[54:06] it was a they were all different things.
[54:08] They had all different identities. They
[54:10] were used for different purposes. But
[54:12] when it came through the art of the
[54:14] apothecary, it was blended together to
[54:17] become one. And now no longer was it
[54:19] separated. And this is what David was
[54:21] talking about whenever he said God loves
[54:23] unity. He's talking about that God can
[54:26] bring us together in a certain way. He
[54:28] can bring he can bring something
[54:29] together that can't ever be taken apart.
[54:31] He he can put it in a in a certain way
[54:33] that that it can't go back to what it
[54:35] was. And and you know, I you know, I
[54:36] think about that unity and I realize
[54:38] that God loves it, but you realize that
[54:40] God only loves a certain kind of unity.
[54:42] You say, "Well, God loves unity." That's
[54:44] a true statement, but it depends on what
[54:45] you unite with. So, God don't love all
[54:47] unity. Can I just say that like that?
[54:49] God don't love all unity. It depends on
[54:51] what it is that you're uniting with. And
[54:53] so, this is what we see in this story
[54:56] here. Jehoshaphat and Ahab. Jehoshaphat
[54:58] was a godly king. He was a godly man.
[55:00] But here he had made a treaty or an
[55:03] alliance with an ungodly man which was
[55:05] King Ahab. And because it was because of
[55:08] Ahab's son. Remember he married
[55:09] Jehoshaphat's daughter. And and when
[55:11] they when the marriage took place, the
[55:12] nations uh became in in in uh uh harmony
[55:15] one with another. And and so here
[55:17] they're about to go into battle. But but
[55:19] it was the time of the judgment of Ahab.
[55:21] And and and and and the call upon the
[55:24] prophets and the prophets would say,
[55:26] "Sure, go into battle. I got one of them
[55:28] made the big horns of of iron and said,
[55:30] "Oh, I see you driving the Syrians out
[55:32] of the land and it's going to be a great
[55:34] victory for you." But when they brought
[55:36] the prophet of God, Micaiah, and and he
[55:38] went to speaking to them, he he got to
[55:40] telling them about what he saw in at the
[55:43] throne of God. He said, "I saw a lying
[55:45] spirit when it left the throne of God."
[55:47] And God said, "You go down there and you
[55:49] anoint all of those prophets that
[55:51] they'll lie to Ahab because I've got a
[55:53] judgment that is coming his way. And I
[55:55] want him to lie to him." So he'll go
[55:56] into battle cuz he's going to meet his
[55:58] judgment that he that that that's been
[56:00] oncoming. And and so Micaiah goes and he
[56:02] tells them exactly what'll take place.
[56:04] And and of course they you know they end
[56:06] up throwing him in jail and said well he
[56:08] don't know anything. There's 400 says
[56:09] we're going to overcome this one guy
[56:11] thinks he knows more than the rest of
[56:13] them. So they put him in a prison and
[56:14] they went into battle and Ahab he when
[56:17] he went into the battle brother Mark he
[56:19] didn't even dress like a king. He
[56:20] remember he dressed in his own uh uh
[56:22] garments as an ordinary uh uh chariot
[56:24] soldier and he said, "I won't dress like
[56:26] a king. They won't know who I am when I
[56:28] go into battle." So uh we'll just we'll
[56:30] just prove that that guy wrong. But when
[56:31] they went into battle, the Syrians had
[56:34] already made a declaration. Only kill
[56:36] the king. Don't go after nobody else.
[56:38] Don't fight with nobody else. Only kill
[56:40] the king. And so when they went into
[56:42] battle and they came down there, they
[56:44] found they went to where Jehoshaphat
[56:46] was. And they began to circle his
[56:48] chariot and they shouted out, "This is
[56:50] not King Ahab. It's King Jehoshaphat,
[56:52] our fight is not with him." So they
[56:54] begin to retreat from battle because the
[56:56] King Ahab was not on the battlefield.
[56:58] And the Bible told the story of how that
[57:00] one man who disobeyed orders that just
[57:03] took a bow and he launched an arrow at a
[57:05] venture out into the crowd as they were
[57:07] fleeing and his arrow actually caught
[57:10] Ahab between his shoulder blades when he
[57:12] was riding in a chariot. He wasn't
[57:14] wearing king's robes, but he caught the
[57:16] judgment of God. So, in other words, he
[57:18] couldn't hide from it. And what Micaiah
[57:20] told him was the truth. And and it
[57:22] didn't matter how he dressed it up or
[57:24] how he shaped it up or how many people
[57:26] told him it was okay. And so so so we
[57:28] saw Jehoshaphat, he was nearly killed as
[57:31] a consequence of going into this treaty.
[57:33] It it cost him it cost people their
[57:35] life, men around him that lost their
[57:37] life in a battle because of a treaty
[57:39] that he made with an ungodly man. So you
[57:42] know what Jehoshaphat done when he went
[57:44] back into Israel? He recognized his
[57:46] wrongs and he went and he started
[57:47] restoring the kingdom and and he put the
[57:50] he took the idols out and he put uh the
[57:52] things of God back into the temple and
[57:54] he he began to turn uh uh the nation
[57:56] back uh from their from their wickedness
[57:58] and and what he's showing us here this
[58:01] story it lays a foundation that the very
[58:03] things that you unite with it might not
[58:05] be pleasing to God. Can I just say that
[58:08] it may not be pleasing to God. See
[58:10] because everything you unite there's
[58:12] always a product. Brother would uh would
[58:14] take uh some time on this. He said that
[58:16] he said it may be shocking but even
[58:18] physical death come as a product of a
[58:21] uniting. It came from the uniting of
[58:23] mother Eve and Satan together. And when
[58:25] they united together, it brought they
[58:28] were disbelieving God's word and they
[58:30] united and brought the product of death.
[58:32] See, so death is a product of uniting
[58:35] Satan and Eve together. He said that's
[58:38] what brought death. It was the uniting
[58:40] of unbelief it with the word of God. And
[58:42] it wasn't a lot of it. He said it was
[58:44] just a teeny little 100th of 1% is how
[58:48] much unbelief that she had, but uh 100th
[58:51] of 1% of unbelief united with the word
[58:54] of God and it brought death to the
[58:56] entire human race. He said, "So I
[58:58] thought, my isn't it something that that
[58:59] that you say, well, how much should I
[59:01] believe God anyway?" I tell you what a
[59:03] prophet said. He said, "You just believe
[59:05] God 100% of the time. You just believe
[59:08] God. That's all that God requires is us
[59:10] just to believe 100% of it. How how much
[59:13] of the word should I believe in order to
[59:14] be called a believer? Let me just make
[59:16] it easy for you. All of it. How much of
[59:18] the promise of God should I believe to
[59:20] be called a believer? You just believe
[59:22] all of it. He said 100% of it. That's
[59:24] what you believe. That's why that's what
[59:26] we are. We're believers. I I wonder how
[59:28] many can say that tonight. I believe
[59:29] God. Somebody go ahead and say it. I
[59:31] believe God. See, I believe. He said,
[59:33] "How much I believe?" 100%. So I thought
[59:36] if the uniting of unbelief and the word
[59:38] brings a product, there's always
[59:40] something that comes from it. There
[59:42] there there's death that comes from it.
[59:44] And so if uniting of unbelief in the
[59:46] word brings a product, then what happens
[59:49] when you unite faith with the word?
[59:51] &gt;&gt; See, if unbelief and in the word brings
[59:53] a product of death, then what happens
[59:55] when you unite faith and the word of God
[59:57] together? I'll just say it to you. Faith
[59:59] and the word united together always
[1:00:02] brings life. I could preach an hour on
[1:00:05] faith and the word united together. It
[1:00:07] always brings life. And friends, it
[1:00:09] ain't just any kind of life. But you
[1:00:11] remember when Mary was walking down the
[1:00:13] road that day and the and the Holy Ghost
[1:00:15] came, the angel of the Lord came and
[1:00:17] begin to reveal to her what was going to
[1:00:19] happen in her life and and and and the
[1:00:21] Bible would tell us that the Holy Ghost
[1:00:23] descended upon her. But B said when the
[1:00:25] Holy Spirit, it united in a body of
[1:00:28] flesh in Mary. He said it produced the
[1:00:31] son of God which was a product of the
[1:00:34] righteousness of God. I thought, isn't
[1:00:35] that something powerful? Are y'all
[1:00:37] hearing me? When the Holy Spirit united
[1:00:39] with a body of flesh, it produced the
[1:00:42] product of the righteousness of God. It
[1:00:45] took a flesh that that was born just
[1:00:47] like you and I. A flesh that is filled
[1:00:49] with sin just like you and I. A flesh
[1:00:51] that that that that was not worthy just
[1:00:53] like you and I. But when that flesh was
[1:00:56] united with the Holy Spirit, it it made
[1:00:58] a product of the righteousness of God.
[1:01:01] And brother Bram said, "And the bride is
[1:01:03] a product of God and his word uniting."
[1:01:06] And when the bride unites with the
[1:01:08] spirit of God, it'll bring forth the
[1:01:11] life of Christ. Again,
[1:01:13] &gt;&gt; somebody say again.
[1:01:14] &gt;&gt; Again.
[1:01:15] &gt;&gt; You say, "Well, how do you unite with
[1:01:16] the spirit of God?" Well, what we need
[1:01:19] is a spiritual apothecary.
[1:01:22] &gt;&gt; Can I say that tonight? What we need is
[1:01:24] a spiritual apothecary that could cause
[1:01:27] a blending to happen with a flesh and a
[1:01:31] spirit. A flesh of a man and all of the
[1:01:34] ingredients that we have in our life
[1:01:36] whenever we come to God. Oh friends, I I
[1:01:38] I could take all night thinking of the
[1:01:40] of the things that we bring to the altar
[1:01:43] whenever we come to God. And when we
[1:01:45] come into the into the place of the
[1:01:47] apothecary, the things that are in our
[1:01:49] life, all the ingredients that each one
[1:01:50] of us carry, that are a part of our
[1:01:52] nature and the way that God made us,
[1:01:54] that God knows just what you need, what
[1:01:56] what needs to be blended into your life
[1:01:58] to bring a product of the righteousness
[1:02:00] of God. And in the house of the of the
[1:02:03] spiritual apothecary, he begins to blend
[1:02:06] your life with the right kind of word
[1:02:08] and the right spirit and just the right
[1:02:10] ANOINTING AND JUST THE RIGHT MOVE of God
[1:02:12] and just the right thing being said that
[1:02:15] would bring your life to this place that
[1:02:17] it would manifest the righteousness of
[1:02:19] God himself. Says, see, so we had to
[1:02:21] have an apothecary, one that would know
[1:02:25] just how to blend our life, just how to
[1:02:27] blend us together. Let me tell you what
[1:02:29] the Bible said. The Bible tells us in
[1:02:31] the last day that the bride would be
[1:02:33] united. Brother Bam said by what? He
[1:02:35] said the bride would be united by the
[1:02:37] word of God made manifest in the flesh.
[1:02:41] So the Holy Spirit is sealing them into
[1:02:44] God and it's sealing unbelief out on the
[1:02:46] outside. I I thought, isn't that
[1:02:48] something? Unbelief is being sealed on
[1:02:50] the outside and on the inside the Holy
[1:02:52] Ghost is being sealed. You that no
[1:02:54] wonder the devil can't do anything with
[1:02:56] you. See, and what's happen? It's our
[1:02:57] apothecary. It's that spiritual one that
[1:03:00] knows how to blend our life and and he's
[1:03:02] creating a real unity in our life. He
[1:03:05] see he said what is it that the the
[1:03:07] bride will be united by the word of God
[1:03:11] made manifest in the flesh? That's
[1:03:13] always a big question. What brings unity
[1:03:16] in the church? What is theii the bride
[1:03:18] united? Let me can I just take some
[1:03:20] liberty here tonight? Can can I just be
[1:03:22] a pastor? A church ain't ever going to
[1:03:24] be a church if it's united around
[1:03:26] people's fellowship. It ain't ever going
[1:03:27] to be a church if it's united around a
[1:03:29] volleyball game. It ain't and and our
[1:03:31] kids, we sure love to come out and and
[1:03:33] to have fellowship and do those things
[1:03:35] and and I know sometimes people look at
[1:03:36] a church and say, "Well, they don't do
[1:03:38] that very much and they don't hang out
[1:03:40] enough." So, they must not have any
[1:03:42] unity and they're not very united or
[1:03:43] they don't get together and they don't
[1:03:45] but you friends that ain't got nothing
[1:03:46] to do with the unity in a church. Matter
[1:03:48] of fact, if your unity be Lord Lord help
[1:03:51] us. But if the unity in a church is is
[1:03:53] is around a volleyball game, it takes
[1:03:55] one call or one ball that hits on the
[1:03:58] border of the line to break the church
[1:04:00] apart. If it's around a fellowship, it
[1:04:02] takes one sister making the same dish
[1:04:04] that the other one made or or one
[1:04:05] brother that didn't tell somebody about
[1:04:07] it and they didn't they didn't make it
[1:04:09] and then it would fall all apart if
[1:04:10] that's what the unity was about. But the
[1:04:12] unity of the church has nothing to do
[1:04:15] with the fellowship in the building. It
[1:04:17] has nothing to do with the games. It has
[1:04:19] nothing to do with people coming
[1:04:20] together. That's not what brings the
[1:04:22] unity in the bride of Jesus Christ. But
[1:04:24] a prophet said the bride will be united
[1:04:27] by the word of God made manifest in her
[1:04:30] flesh. It'll be the Holy Spirit sealing
[1:04:33] them into God and sealing unbelief out.
[1:04:36] Oh, don't you realize, friends, it's the
[1:04:37] Holy Ghost. That's the only unity that
[1:04:39] we really have in the body of Christ.
[1:04:42] It's the holy It's the only unity that
[1:04:44] you have in your marriage. It's the only
[1:04:46] unity THAT YOU HAVE IN YOUR HOME. IT
[1:04:48] COMES BY THE BAPTISM OF THE HOLY GHOST.
[1:04:50] I've had many people try to get me to
[1:04:52] fix their problems. You know what they
[1:04:54] do? They come say, "Well, I got a
[1:04:56] problem in my marriage, pastor. So, why
[1:04:58] don't you come up with a formula that'll
[1:04:59] fix my marriage? Maybe you can get some
[1:05:01] quotes and maybe we can get some
[1:05:02] scriptures AND WE CAN PUT THEM IN A BAG
[1:05:04] AND SHAKE them up and deliver them to
[1:05:06] your house. And maybe that'll HELP YOU
[1:05:07] GET THROUGH YOUR MARRIAGE." But let ME
[1:05:09] TELL YOU, FRIENDS, GOD DON'T NEED SOME
[1:05:10] MAN TAMPERING WITH THE ONLY THING
[1:05:12] THAT'LL ever help a marriage. IT'S THE
[1:05:14] BAPTISM OF THE HOLY GHOST. when they
[1:05:17] want deliverance, they want some secret
[1:05:18] way. They want you to bring something.
[1:05:20] Oh, I'm just preaching you, but but but
[1:05:22] they want you to bring something THAT'LL
[1:05:24] HELP THEM. GIVE ME SOME word or give me
[1:05:26] some scripture or give me some song
[1:05:28] that'll help me through this. And all
[1:05:30] those are great things. Said, but that
[1:05:32] ain't ever going to unite your marriage.
[1:05:34] It ain't ever going to unite you and
[1:05:36] God. Oh, preacher, give me the secret
[1:05:38] sauce. Can I just tell you friends, the
[1:05:39] cure has already been formulated. It
[1:05:42] ain't nothing that I can make up. I
[1:05:44] can't mix up something for you. I can't
[1:05:46] make it any prettier. It's the baptism
[1:05:48] of the Holy Ghost. It what causes A MAN
[1:05:50] TO REJECT HIS OLD NATURE AND PUT ON THE
[1:05:53] NATURE OF GOD. WELL, FRIENDS, when you
[1:05:55] take the nature of God, said then then
[1:05:57] you can be united with the bride of
[1:06:00] Jesus Christ. That's where you real
[1:06:02] unity comes from. So, everybody's
[1:06:04] looking for an answer. Everybody's
[1:06:05] looking uh to be uh to to to fix the
[1:06:08] problems. But but the the the the answer
[1:06:10] is simple. It's what Dr. Peter gave us
[1:06:13] on the day of Pentecost when he gave the
[1:06:15] prescription. He said, "Repent and be
[1:06:16] baptized IN THE NAME OF JESUS Christ for
[1:06:18] the remission of your sins and you shall
[1:06:20] receive the gift of the Holy Ghost
[1:06:23] &gt;&gt; is always the prescription." Brother
[1:06:25] said they these quack drugists today
[1:06:27] that they they try by denomination to
[1:06:30] fill it some other way. He called them
[1:06:32] quack drugus. He said, "But you don't
[1:06:34] add two and all that. You might kill
[1:06:35] your patient, but your physician knows
[1:06:37] just how to write the prescription." And
[1:06:39] Christ, the Holy Ghost is the
[1:06:41] prescription writer and he wrote it.
[1:06:43] Don't add to it or take away from it.
[1:06:45] Just take the medicine that way she is.
[1:06:47] It's the cure for all ailments.
[1:06:52] &gt;&gt; What's the secret sauce? The secret
[1:06:54] sauce is the Holy Ghost.
[1:06:56] &gt;&gt; It's the cure for all ailments. It's the
[1:06:59] baptism of the Holy Ghost.
[1:07:01] &gt;&gt; See, God has called the church to unite
[1:07:05] with the word.
[1:07:07] This is the uniting that God is calling
[1:07:09] the church to. Remember said we see
[1:07:10] nations uniting the world uniting.
[1:07:14] &gt;&gt; Churches are uniting. He said, "But we
[1:07:16] see the bride uniting with the word." He
[1:07:19] said, "Why?" Because the word is God.
[1:07:22] And as the bridegroom being the word,
[1:07:24] the bridegroom, who is the word, and the
[1:07:26] bride being the hearer of the word, when
[1:07:28] they come together in a union, they
[1:07:31] unite like a wedding and they're getting
[1:07:32] ready for a wedding. They become one.
[1:07:34] The word becomes you and you become the
[1:07:36] word. I thought, isn't it something here
[1:07:38] that God didn't call us to unite with
[1:07:41] the world? See, our sometimes our faith
[1:07:43] gets united with the wrong thing.
[1:07:45] &gt;&gt; We can't put our you That's why
[1:07:47] preachers say, "Don't put your faith in
[1:07:48] a church. Don't put your faith in a
[1:07:50] pastor. Don't put your faith in one
[1:07:51] another. Don't put your faith, you know,
[1:07:53] because it's so easy to put our faith in
[1:07:56] other things." But the but our faith
[1:07:58] gets united with the wrong thing and it
[1:08:00] don't bring forth
[1:08:01] &gt;&gt; don't bring forth the desired result.
[1:08:04] So, so, so he said, "What do we unite
[1:08:06] with?" Our faith is to be united with
[1:08:08] the word. That's why this church is so
[1:08:10] powerful,
[1:08:11] &gt;&gt; isn't it, brother David? It's the best
[1:08:12] church in the world. You know that? It's
[1:08:13] the best church in the world. And let me
[1:08:15] tell you why it's so powerful is because
[1:08:16] demons leave when the when the when the
[1:08:19] word is being preached. It's becau
[1:08:20] because cancers are healed in this
[1:08:22] church. Blinded eyes have been open in
[1:08:24] this church. The dead have been raised.
[1:08:26] It's the greatest church that there ever
[1:08:28] was. And it's not a church you can join.
[1:08:30] It ain't a church you can work your way
[1:08:31] into. It ain't a church that you can
[1:08:33] earn your way into, but you can only be
[1:08:35] born into it. And it's the greatest
[1:08:37] church that there ever was. And I'm so
[1:08:39] glad I can be a part of the church that
[1:08:41] is united in the word of God by the
[1:08:44] power of God, by the baptism of the Holy
[1:08:46] Ghost. So, see, when faith unites with
[1:08:48] the word, then the supernatural happens.
[1:08:52] &gt;&gt; That's why they talk about our church
[1:08:54] around the world. That's why they talk
[1:08:55] that's why they they that's why the
[1:08:57] devil hates it so much around the world
[1:08:59] is because he hates the supernatural
[1:09:00] that's taking place among this church
[1:09:03] that we are a part of.
[1:09:05] &gt;&gt; Amen. We've been born into it. Many of
[1:09:07] us, there's millions of members around
[1:09:09] the world. We've been born into it. It's
[1:09:10] our church.
[1:09:11] &gt;&gt; That's our body.
[1:09:14] &gt;&gt; And we're united by the Holy Ghost.
[1:09:17] &gt;&gt; See, when faith unites the word, the
[1:09:20] supernatural happens. You know, I think
[1:09:23] think of a a story or a testimony.
[1:09:26] Brother Bram was actually uh you can
[1:09:28] hear on tape. He's talking to a lady
[1:09:30] that that that come up for prayer and he
[1:09:32] said the angel of the Lord, he was just
[1:09:34] a few feet away. He said he was standing
[1:09:35] there. He's a man larger than I. The
[1:09:37] woman standing here, she's conscious of
[1:09:39] him being here. He said, "I want to ask
[1:09:40] you something, lady." He said, "You're
[1:09:42] probably known amongst this crowd. I
[1:09:44] don't know you, but you're conscious
[1:09:45] that something is going on. If that's
[1:09:47] right, raise your hand." Here she raises
[1:09:48] her hand. He said, "It's his presence."
[1:09:50] Now watch what we're speaking of when
[1:09:52] faith unites with the word here. This
[1:09:54] woman has come to the the meeting and
[1:09:56] she's she's looking for prayer and and
[1:09:59] and he says, "Sister," he said, "you
[1:10:00] suffer with some sort of headache
[1:10:02] condition. It's causing you to have bad
[1:10:04] headaches all the time. Is that right?"
[1:10:05] And then as he starts to tell her, he
[1:10:07] breaks into a vision. He said, "I see
[1:10:09] you holding your head in your hand many
[1:10:12] times like that." And you do that quite
[1:10:14] you're doing quite a bit of reading or
[1:10:16] something. Oh, I see. It's a book or a
[1:10:18] magazine or something you're reading.
[1:10:20] You're sitting there reading. He said,
[1:10:22] "You're sitting in a room. There's a
[1:10:23] chair. You're reading something." He
[1:10:25] said, "Is that what it was?" She said,
[1:10:27] "Yes." He said, "Oh, I seen it was a
[1:10:29] book when you was reading. You had a
[1:10:31] headache and you were rubbing your head
[1:10:32] like this while you were reading the
[1:10:34] book." He said, "Oh, it was a white
[1:10:36] book. It was white looking." "Oh, now I
[1:10:38] see it. It was my book. Is that true? Is
[1:10:41] that what you were reading?" She said,
[1:10:42] "Yes." He said, "You," He said, "you
[1:10:44] become conscious." He said, "Nobody
[1:10:45] knows that cuz there's nobody there but
[1:10:47] you." He said, "But God seen you." And
[1:10:50] you thought then while you were reading
[1:10:52] this book, think about it. I'm talking
[1:10:54] about faith uniting with the word of
[1:10:56] God. Here she's sitting in a room. She's
[1:10:58] reading the book. There ain't nobody
[1:10:59] around. And the angel of the Lord is
[1:11:02] showing it in a vision. He said, "And
[1:11:03] while you were reading the book, you
[1:11:05] thought then if I can get to the meeting
[1:11:08] and maybe if he will pray for me, then
[1:11:10] these headaches will cease." He said,
[1:11:12] "That's when you begin to have faith."
[1:11:15] Said, "See, because he said, 'Isn't that
[1:11:17] right that that I might tell you
[1:11:19] something else that'll move your faith
[1:11:20] up?" He said, "It's caused from a female
[1:11:23] trouble. That's your headaches." He
[1:11:24] said, "I know you've been told other
[1:11:25] things, but it's wrong." He said, "Your
[1:11:27] doctor said you had migraine headaches
[1:11:28] and so forth like that, but it's wrong.
[1:11:30] They made an error. I'm not trying to
[1:11:32] correct the doctor, but I know what I'm
[1:11:33] speaking of. In order that you might
[1:11:35] know that I am God's prophet, you don't
[1:11:37] belong to this type of a church. You
[1:11:39] belong to another kind of church. It's a
[1:11:40] Christian Science church. Is that right?
[1:11:42] He said, "I knew that you were a
[1:11:44] Christian Science because when I saw you
[1:11:46] in the vision reading my book, you were
[1:11:48] sitting in the Christian Science reading
[1:11:50] room whenever you were reading the
[1:11:52] book." He said, "That's the reason I
[1:11:53] know you belong to it or you was there.
[1:11:55] If that's right, raise your hand." He
[1:11:57] said, "All right. Well, come here. Do
[1:11:58] you believe that if I will ask God that
[1:12:00] this ain't mind over matter? It's the
[1:12:02] power of almighty God to make it leave
[1:12:04] you. You believe? All right. You'll just
[1:12:06] serve him all the days of your life." He
[1:12:07] said, "God, I've seen your light flash
[1:12:09] around this woman, and I believe that
[1:12:11] the hour is here for her healing
[1:12:14] sincerely and humbly that the spirit of
[1:12:16] God has moved upon the woman." I
[1:12:19] thought, "My, isn't it the power of God
[1:12:21] that would bring a woman out of a
[1:12:23] Christian Science Center here, Brother
[1:12:25] David, she was sitting and reading a
[1:12:27] book about the truth of the word of
[1:12:29] God." And here a woman that didn't even
[1:12:31] know how to have faith, but she began to
[1:12:33] think in her mind that if I can just get
[1:12:35] there and I can just be prayed for, then
[1:12:38] I'll be healed. And the prophet said,
[1:12:39] "Right there, your faith is where it
[1:12:41] started." You see, you see where her
[1:12:43] healing her healing started. It's when
[1:12:45] her faith and the word united here. She
[1:12:48] was in a place that didn't preach the
[1:12:50] right that didn't preach the truth. and
[1:12:52] she was in a place that was all about
[1:12:54] science and and the way that uh the way
[1:12:56] that they had had termed the the gospel
[1:12:59] and made it all all about science and
[1:13:01] things and and made many of the
[1:13:03] supernatural things of God of none
[1:13:05] effect. But she was sitting in that kind
[1:13:07] of a building. But when her faith had
[1:13:09] met the word of God, he said that's when
[1:13:12] it started. I thought my her healing
[1:13:14] didn't take place when it was down at
[1:13:16] the altar. It started right there when
[1:13:19] she was sitting in that place and her
[1:13:21] faith met the word of God and something
[1:13:23] on the inside of her started to say, "If
[1:13:25] I could just get down to the meeting,
[1:13:27] then I would receive my healing." Said,
[1:13:30] "Then the spirit of God moved on the
[1:13:33] woman." You say, "Well, what was the
[1:13:34] result of her faith in the word
[1:13:36] uniting?" I can tell you the result here
[1:13:38] standing in the presence of the prophet
[1:13:40] of God. He said, "Satan, you've hid from
[1:13:42] the doctor, but you can't hide from God.
[1:13:45] He knows right where you are in the name
[1:13:47] of Jesus Christ, the son of the living
[1:13:49] God. You come out of that woman. He
[1:13:51] said, "Now look here, sister. Of course,
[1:13:53] you don't have it now, but you go. It's
[1:13:56] left you. It'll stay from you. As long
[1:13:58] as you can believe and have faith, God
[1:14:00] bless you."
[1:14:02] &gt;&gt; Because her faith united with the word
[1:14:04] of God, the supernatural happens.
[1:14:08] &gt;&gt; Isn't that a powerful thought? When
[1:14:09] faith unites with the word of God, super
[1:14:11] supernatural. You know what I think the
[1:14:13] problem is today is too many people are
[1:14:16] trying to make treaties with the devil.
[1:14:18] See, cuz he tries he he tries to put our
[1:14:20] faith in so many other things. Well,
[1:14:22] why? If you if you have a mixed up
[1:14:23] marriage, you put your faith in a
[1:14:25] psychologist. If you have if you have an
[1:14:27] addiction, you put your faith in a AA
[1:14:29] meeting or something. Or if you or if
[1:14:31] you have a sin or a besetting sin or
[1:14:33] something that was that your father had
[1:14:35] struggled with, but well, the devil just
[1:14:36] says, "Well, you're going to have to
[1:14:37] cope with it." Or maybe you have a
[1:14:39] sickness that's hereditary. Well, you're
[1:14:41] just going to have to cope with it.
[1:14:42] After all, your dad went through that
[1:14:44] same thing and and your mom, she had the
[1:14:46] same illness and and you know, the
[1:14:47] doctor said it's hereditary and you're
[1:14:49] going to have to carry it for the rest
[1:14:51] of your life just because they carried
[1:14:52] it. What's happening? It's the devil
[1:14:54] trying to make a treaty with a believer
[1:14:57] that he knows that if you ever put your
[1:14:58] faith in the word of God, it's going to
[1:15:00] bring a result ABOUT YOUR LIFE. SO HE
[1:15:02] MAKES A TREATY AND SAYS JUST ACCEPT it
[1:15:05] the way it IS AND JUST ACCEPT YOUR
[1:15:06] SICKNESS AND JUST ACCEPT your sin and
[1:15:08] and JUST ACCEPT YOUR YOUR ADDICTION and
[1:15:11] just allow it to stay in YOUR LIFE
[1:15:12] BECAUSE YOU'VE TRIED TOO many times and
[1:15:14] you couldn't get rid of it and you
[1:15:16] couldn't get over it and you can't get
[1:15:17] around it. So you may as well just LEAVE
[1:15:19] IT ALONE. IT'S A TREATY with the devil.
[1:15:22] &gt;&gt; And I don't think we ought to make any
[1:15:24] treaties with the devil. People's lost
[1:15:25] their faith in God. They've lost faith
[1:15:27] in healing. They don't believe in
[1:15:29] healing anymore. They'll accept a
[1:15:30] sickness and carry it. But remember said
[1:15:32] why they don't believe in divine
[1:15:34] healing. He said because the devil found
[1:15:36] a weak spot in you and he perverted it.
[1:15:40] &gt;&gt; Why they lost their faith in healing?
[1:15:42] The devil found a weak spot in you and
[1:15:44] he perverted it. He said, "But God is a
[1:15:47] healer." Somebody say, "God is a
[1:15:48] healer."
[1:15:49] &gt;&gt; And we're offsprings of God, sons and
[1:15:51] daughters of God, believing it like our
[1:15:54] father believes. See, when faith is
[1:15:56] united with the word, the supernatural
[1:15:59] happens.
[1:16:00] No wonder that that see the devil knows
[1:16:03] the recipe, brother Bobby. He knows the
[1:16:05] recipe. This ain't a secret. The devil
[1:16:07] knows if you can ever unite your faith
[1:16:09] with God's word, it's going to bring the
[1:16:11] supernatural.
[1:16:12] &gt;&gt; The devil knows it.
[1:16:14] &gt;&gt; So, he tries to cause you to take your
[1:16:16] faith away from the word of God. Isn't
[1:16:18] it something? Why you say, "Why is he
[1:16:20] always attacking my faith?" And and it's
[1:16:22] not that the devil don't want you to
[1:16:24] have faith. He just don't want you to
[1:16:26] put your faith in a place where the
[1:16:27] supernatural can happen. So you can have
[1:16:29] faith in all kinds of things. You can
[1:16:31] have faith in in the in in the doctors
[1:16:34] and the teachers and the psychologist
[1:16:35] psych. You can have faith in all kinds
[1:16:37] of things, but and the devil's fine with
[1:16:39] it, but you just don't you just don't
[1:16:40] want us to have faith in the word of
[1:16:42] God.
[1:16:43] &gt;&gt; So see in the days of Jesus, the
[1:16:46] Pharisees, you think of it, they were
[1:16:48] striving to attain righteousness.
[1:16:52] Remember what they they they they had
[1:16:55] strived to live a life that was a
[1:16:57] righteous life. They called themselves
[1:16:58] righteous men. But Paul when he would
[1:17:00] come, he said the Gentiles which
[1:17:02] followed not after righteousness. They
[1:17:04] obtained righteousness, the
[1:17:06] righteousness which is of faith. He and
[1:17:09] he actually shows how that the Pharisees
[1:17:11] had lived their whole life and tried to
[1:17:14] attain something that they never
[1:17:15] obtained. He said the Gentiles never
[1:17:17] done anything y'all did and they've
[1:17:19] obtained the very thing you tried to
[1:17:21] obtain and all they did was obtained it
[1:17:23] by faith. They lived a life their whole
[1:17:25] life that was a perfect life and they
[1:17:27] never could be righteous before God. So
[1:17:29] see so they never had it. So so here he
[1:17:32] shows us there's two classes that's
[1:17:34] trying to obtain the same thing. Israel
[1:17:35] which followed after the law of
[1:17:37] righteousness. They have not obtained
[1:17:39] the law of righteousness. But why? He
[1:17:41] said why? Because they sought it not by
[1:17:43] faith but they sought it by the works of
[1:17:46] the law and they stumbled at the
[1:17:48] stumbling stone. So they were trying to
[1:17:50] be righteous before God. They were
[1:17:52] sincere men. But when righteousness came
[1:17:54] before them, they rejected it. So here
[1:17:56] when Jesus would come and he would speak
[1:17:58] to the Pharisees, they rejected Jesus
[1:18:01] because he offered a way to receive
[1:18:03] righteousness by faith. In other words,
[1:18:05] he's showing them how to take the power
[1:18:07] of taking faith and mixing it with the
[1:18:09] word of God.
[1:18:11] &gt;&gt; See, because their faith was in other
[1:18:12] things. Their righteousness came from
[1:18:14] from living a certain law. Their
[1:18:16] righteousness came from wearing a
[1:18:18] certain kind of garment. And and after
[1:18:20] all, we kept the Sabbath and we we never
[1:18:22] missed and we never failed. And I've got
[1:18:24] no there's no spots on my life. I
[1:18:26] thought, isn't it something? Isn't that
[1:18:27] what the devil does? You ever find
[1:18:29] somebody that's living for God and
[1:18:30] somebody that ain't? The one that ain't
[1:18:32] always pointing out everything a
[1:18:34] righteous man ever done wrong.
[1:18:36] &gt;&gt; You say, "Why is he doing it?" Because
[1:18:37] he can't accept that you receive
[1:18:39] righteousness by faith. Because in his
[1:18:41] own mind, he's never received it. He's
[1:18:44] still trying to receive it by law. So he
[1:18:46] can look at everybody else that's
[1:18:48] attained righteousness. As Paul said,
[1:18:50] this ain't my message. This is Apostle
[1:18:51] Paul. He'll look at everybody else
[1:18:53] that's attained righteousness and
[1:18:55] condemn them for their past and condemn
[1:18:57] them for their sin and condemn them for
[1:18:59] their faults and condemn them for their
[1:19:01] problems because he's living by another
[1:19:03] law
[1:19:04] &gt;&gt; and he can't understand how that they
[1:19:06] can receive it by faith. See, because
[1:19:08] faith and the word mixed together brings
[1:19:10] supernatural. See, so he wants to break
[1:19:13] apart our faith in these things. You you
[1:19:15] see what stumbled the Pharisees that
[1:19:17] Jesus was offering righteousness by
[1:19:19] faith
[1:19:20] &gt;&gt; and they felt that they obtained it by
[1:19:22] their own works.
[1:19:23] &gt;&gt; Here Jesus was offering it a different
[1:19:25] way. So you I mean you I I want to say
[1:19:28] this. I realize righteousness is
[1:19:29] something that we must have. How many
[1:19:31] knows that?
[1:19:32] &gt;&gt; It's not an option. We must have that
[1:19:35] &gt;&gt; in order to make it. It's in order for
[1:19:36] God to be pleased. We must have
[1:19:38] righteousness. Matter of fact, Jesus
[1:19:39] said, "Blessed are they that hunger and
[1:19:41] thirst after righteousness, for they
[1:19:43] shall be filled."
[1:19:44] &gt;&gt; But then Jesus shows us that there are
[1:19:46] different levels of righteousness. You
[1:19:49] ever you ever thought of that? That
[1:19:50] there that there that there's more than
[1:19:52] one level of righteousness. Uh he in
[1:19:54] Matthew the 5th chapter, he said, "I say
[1:19:56] unto you that except your righteousness
[1:19:58] exceeds the righteousness of the scribes
[1:20:01] and Pharisees, then you shall in no case
[1:20:03] enter into the kingdom of heaven." So he
[1:20:06] showed us there's a different level of
[1:20:07] righteousness. So they have some some
[1:20:10] level of righteousness in their works,
[1:20:12] but Jesus said, "Unless yours exceeds
[1:20:14] theirs, you shall in no wise enter into
[1:20:18] the kingdom of God." So your
[1:20:20] righteousness must be a greater
[1:20:22] righteousness. You say, "Well, how can
[1:20:24] you have a righteous that that's more
[1:20:26] than the Pharisee that devoted their
[1:20:27] lives? They they lived the law exactly.
[1:20:30] They never wavered. They never faltered.
[1:20:32] They they never they never missed. They
[1:20:34] kept the Sabbath. They done all these
[1:20:36] things just right. And they they spent
[1:20:37] all their time trying to be righteous.
[1:20:39] But don't you realize something this uh
[1:20:41] this evening that it ain't something
[1:20:42] that you can work yourself into.
[1:20:45] &gt;&gt; Brother David, it ain't something that
[1:20:46] you can build up. It ain't something
[1:20:47] that you can that you can work into. But
[1:20:49] the righteousness of God is a God-given
[1:20:52] quality.
[1:20:53] &gt;&gt; Can I just lay that in there? It's a
[1:20:55] God-given quality. And people that
[1:20:57] become righteous, think about it, in
[1:20:59] their own works, they're they're they're
[1:21:00] they're trying to be righteous without
[1:21:03] God. But listen what Isaiah said here as
[1:21:07] a prophet of God. He said, "But but we
[1:21:09] are all as an unclean thing, and we are
[1:21:12] all our righteousness is as filthy rags,
[1:21:15] and we all do fade as a leaf, and our
[1:21:17] iniquities like the wind have taken us
[1:21:20] away. And there is none that calleth
[1:21:22] upon thy name, that stereth up himself,
[1:21:24] and take a hold of thee, for thou hast
[1:21:26] hid thy face from us, and hast consumed
[1:21:28] us because of our iniquities. But now,
[1:21:29] oh Lord, thou art our father. We are the
[1:21:31] clay, thou art the potter. We are all
[1:21:33] the work of thy hand. Be not angry, very
[1:21:36] sure, oh Lord. Neither remember our
[1:21:38] iniquity forever. Behold, see that we
[1:21:40] beseech thee, that we are thy people.
[1:21:43] Here, here the prophet is acknowledging
[1:21:45] to God that we are relying upon thy
[1:21:48] mercy. for for for ain't none of us are
[1:21:50] righteous. None of our works are good
[1:21:52] enough. Nothing I Anybody ever feel that
[1:21:54] way? Come on, we may as well just be
[1:21:55] honest there. There ain't no matter how
[1:21:57] hard I try, I can't ever be good enough
[1:21:59] to please God. No matter how hard I try
[1:22:01] or how much I effort I put into it, I
[1:22:03] can't ever get my life good enough. I
[1:22:05] can't get close enough to God. I can't I
[1:22:07] I can't just seem to to get where I want
[1:22:09] to be. I'm always longing for more.
[1:22:12] &gt;&gt; But Isaiah said, "This is what we are.
[1:22:14] This is our nature. It's our none of our
[1:22:16] righteousness is good enough." He said,
[1:22:18] ' But Lord, we're we're your people. Now
[1:22:20] Paul takes the very thing that Isaiah is
[1:22:23] speaking of and he preach it teaches it.
[1:22:25] He said, "Our righteousness comes by
[1:22:28] faith. It's not by merit that the Jews
[1:22:31] would say that that it's by our effort
[1:22:33] or by the things that we done or how
[1:22:35] many times they went in the temple, how
[1:22:36] many times they they cleaned, how many
[1:22:38] times they they rang the bells, how he
[1:22:40] said it wasn't by that." He said, "But
[1:22:41] our righteousness of a believer since
[1:22:44] the time of Christ come by faith."
[1:22:46] That's the only righteousness that we
[1:22:48] have. He said see so when we get a real
[1:22:50] faith then your righteousness is only in
[1:22:54] Christ then brother Mark when you can
[1:22:56] live you can live the word without it
[1:22:58] being a burden.
[1:23:00] &gt;&gt; Now you can live freely as a Christian
[1:23:02] as a servant as a son and a daughter of
[1:23:04] God without it being a burden. You you
[1:23:06] can just serve God because you realize
[1:23:08] the only righteousness that you have is
[1:23:10] not in your own works. It's only in
[1:23:13] Christ Jesus. Friends, I'm telling you
[1:23:15] this because it's a revelation that a
[1:23:17] believer has to have in order to be
[1:23:18] free. There's too many people that are
[1:23:20] going around, they've been bound for so
[1:23:22] long that that that they can't even be
[1:23:24] free to serve God because they they
[1:23:26] can't get past their own self. But don't
[1:23:28] you realize that your own self ain't
[1:23:29] ever going to be good enough. So
[1:23:31] surrender to God and surrender to the
[1:23:32] Holy Ghost and surrender to the spirit
[1:23:34] of God and allow God just to lead you
[1:23:36] and overcome your problems. Day by day
[1:23:39] you will overcome another one. The next
[1:23:41] day you'll overcome another one. the
[1:23:43] next month, the next week, you'll
[1:23:44] overcome another one. You just keep
[1:23:46] growing closer and closer to God and
[1:23:48] live and serve God freely.
[1:23:50] &gt;&gt; See, because you'll never be satisfied
[1:23:52] with your walk with God any other way.
[1:23:55] See, these two kings, I probably already
[1:23:58] ran out of time. These two kings,
[1:24:01] Ahab and Jehoshaphat, notice where they
[1:24:03] met.
[1:24:05] The Bible said they met at the gates of
[1:24:07] Samaria. Now Samaria, it was a it was a
[1:24:11] a a a mountain or a hill which was gave
[1:24:14] them a position in case they were
[1:24:16] attacked. That's why they chose that
[1:24:17] place to be the capital of the northern
[1:24:19] kingdom. So here in the gates of
[1:24:21] Samaria, uh the the the Hebrew word, I
[1:24:24] believe it's Sham Shamro or Shamron in
[1:24:27] Samaria, but it actually means a high
[1:24:29] place. It's a it's a it's a mountain, a
[1:24:31] watch mountain or a high place. I
[1:24:33] thought, isn't it something here that
[1:24:35] these these kings, they gathered in this
[1:24:37] high place in order to make a treaty?
[1:24:40] This is where this is where Ahab brought
[1:24:42] Jehoshaphat at too. He brought him into
[1:24:43] this high place, said, "I'm going to
[1:24:44] make a deal with you. Let's go into
[1:24:46] battle." And he he went to make a treaty
[1:24:48] with him. I you know, but but it was in
[1:24:50] that same high place that God sent the
[1:24:53] word of a prophet that said, "Don't you
[1:24:55] go into that because it's going to bring
[1:24:56] destruction." And he warned Jehoshaphat.
[1:24:59] I thought, "Isn't it something to hear
[1:25:01] it was in a mountain? It was in a high
[1:25:02] place. And then when you read in Matthew
[1:25:04] the 4th chapter, the Bible says the
[1:25:06] devil took Jesus where? To an exceeding
[1:25:10] and high mountain
[1:25:12] &gt;&gt; and showed him all the kingdoms of the
[1:25:14] world and the glory of them. Isn't it
[1:25:16] isn't it peculiar that when the devil
[1:25:17] come to make a treaty, he brought him up
[1:25:19] on a mountain into a high place. I'm
[1:25:21] going to make a treaty with you. He
[1:25:23] said, if you'll just bow down and
[1:25:25] worship me, I'll give you all the
[1:25:27] kingdoms of this world. But Abraham said
[1:25:29] he literally showed Jesus all through
[1:25:31] time. He looked at all the kingdoms that
[1:25:33] would rise in this world and the devil
[1:25:35] said if you'll bow down and worship me,
[1:25:37] I'll give them unto you. Say, what was
[1:25:38] the devil trying to do? He was trying to
[1:25:40] make a treaty with Jesus.
[1:25:42] &gt;&gt; Let me make a treaty with you. You'll
[1:25:44] bow down and worship, I'll give you what
[1:25:45] you don't have. He said, but what Jesus
[1:25:47] knew is he knew that he was going to
[1:25:50] fall heir to it anyway. And he knew if
[1:25:52] he allowed the devil to give it to him
[1:25:54] by some treaty, then the devil could
[1:25:56] break it by he could break the treaty.
[1:25:58] But if he purchased it by his own blood,
[1:26:00] then the devil couldn't take it away. He
[1:26:02] said, "And he knew that we as believers
[1:26:05] that the bride of Jesus Christ, they
[1:26:07] would be in those kingdoms and he would
[1:26:09] have to purchase it, that they would be
[1:26:11] his purchased possession." Well,
[1:26:12] friends, aren't you so glad that Jesus
[1:26:14] didn't make a treaty with the devil for
[1:26:16] your life or for this world or for this
[1:26:19] kingdom or for your kingdom? He didn't
[1:26:21] make a treaty with the devil. HE SAID,
[1:26:22] "I'LL NOT MAKE A TREATY, BUT I'LL PAY
[1:26:25] FOR THE on on the cross of Calvary. I'll
[1:26:27] pay the price and I'll purchase them be
[1:26:29] to be mine." He said, "Wen't going to he
[1:26:32] wasn't going to make a treaty with the
[1:26:33] devil." He said he said, "Get behind me,
[1:26:35] Satan. For it is written, thou shalt
[1:26:37] worship the Lord thy God, and him only
[1:26:39] shall they serve."
[1:26:41] &gt;&gt; You know, I got to thinking of those
[1:26:43] mountains where treaties are made. I
[1:26:45] don't have time to go through them all.
[1:26:46] I realize I it's already too late, but I
[1:26:49] can get a couple. that I I think of
[1:26:51] those mountains where treaties were made
[1:26:52] and you know the Bible the Bible tells
[1:26:55] us that we live that we live by two
[1:26:56] laws. How many knows that there was
[1:26:58] there was the law in the book of
[1:27:00] Deuteronomy that was a law of death and
[1:27:02] then Paul would he would show the
[1:27:03] difference. It was a law of death and a
[1:27:04] law of life. He showed the law of life
[1:27:06] in Christ. And so he showed in the book
[1:27:08] of Deuteronomy you read about this this
[1:27:10] law of death the disobedience to the
[1:27:12] word. What did it do? It brought death.
[1:27:14] remember when they came down uh uh the
[1:27:16] came down on on on the mountain and they
[1:27:19] were uh the the the law was given unto
[1:27:21] Moses. But you realize that the
[1:27:23] disobedience it was it brought death.
[1:27:25] But there was another law that
[1:27:26] underlined that that that God didn't say
[1:27:29] it, but it was an underlying law. If
[1:27:31] disobedience brings death, the
[1:27:32] underlying law is obedience brings life.
[1:27:35] &gt;&gt; You see, so so that but they were living
[1:27:37] by this law. He said they and so one was
[1:27:40] a law of death and one was a law of
[1:27:42] life. And brother Ram showed that to
[1:27:44] show us that the law of life has always
[1:27:46] been there. It's always been a part of
[1:27:47] God. So God has always provided a way in
[1:27:50] order for us to live and to have eternal
[1:27:53] life. Even even in the time of Moses,
[1:27:55] there's always been a there's always
[1:27:56] been a way that was provided by God.
[1:27:58] Said, but but see that there's two laws.
[1:28:00] One is the law of death. The other is
[1:28:02] the law of life. He said they both been
[1:28:04] displayed to us in scripture. They've
[1:28:06] been displayed to the world publicly
[1:28:08] openly before every eye. And there's no
[1:28:10] excuse for us. One of them was displayed
[1:28:12] on Mount Si and the other was displayed
[1:28:14] on Mount Calvary. See, see, so isn't
[1:28:17] that the truth? That both laws were
[1:28:18] displayed. The law of death was
[1:28:19] displayed on Mount Si. It's where the
[1:28:21] law was given. It's where it condemned
[1:28:24] the whole human race and it brought
[1:28:26] death. If you didn't obey the law, thou
[1:28:27] shalt not. Thou shalt not. Thou shalt
[1:28:29] not. Thou shalt not. And if you don't
[1:28:31] obey the law, it's going to bring death.
[1:28:33] But on Mount Calvary, it was a different
[1:28:35] kind of law. See, Mount Calvary, it was
[1:28:37] grace that was given. It wasn't it
[1:28:39] wasn't a law that was given on Mount
[1:28:41] Calvary. The penalty was paid for the
[1:28:43] whole human race on Mount Calvary. It
[1:28:45] didn't bring death, it brought life.
[1:28:48] &gt;&gt; So the law, you notice, so so the law of
[1:28:51] death applies to some, but then a law of
[1:28:53] life applied to others. And friend, I
[1:28:56] know what people say today. I want a
[1:28:58] mountaintop experience. How many say
[1:28:59] that? It's okay. I'm not going to trick
[1:29:00] you. We Everybody wants a mountaintop
[1:29:02] experience. Oh, I I want to be on fire.
[1:29:05] I I want the church to be on fire. I I
[1:29:07] want the church to be shouting. We We
[1:29:09] want to be on top of a mountain. Well,
[1:29:10] that all depends on what you're shouting
[1:29:12] about. That all depends on what you're
[1:29:14] on fire about. To me, it depends on what
[1:29:16] mountain you're shouting on. She said,
[1:29:17] "Well, I want a mountain. I want a
[1:29:19] mountain experience." But let me tell
[1:29:20] you, friends, people, they want to be on
[1:29:22] a mountain so bad. I think sometimes
[1:29:24] they'll accept any mountain just to be
[1:29:25] on a mountain.
[1:29:27] &gt;&gt; That they take all kinds of mountains.
[1:29:28] They they they live on a denominational
[1:29:30] mountain because it makes them feel like
[1:29:32] they fit in in town and they can just
[1:29:34] rejoice and everybody's happy and
[1:29:35] everybody just gets along. Although that
[1:29:37] they disobey the word of God, but it's
[1:29:39] okay because everybody's getting along
[1:29:41] and everybody fits in and they're on top
[1:29:43] of a mountain.
[1:29:45] &gt;&gt; They're living on top of a mountain on
[1:29:47] top of the world,
[1:29:49] &gt;&gt; but it's the wrong mountain.
[1:29:52] Then others, they live on a mountain
[1:29:54] like like in the days of Moses, they
[1:29:56] live on a on a mountain of legalism and
[1:29:58] they feel good about theirel. I'm so
[1:29:59] high because I did everything just
[1:30:01] right. And everybody around me, they
[1:30:04] can't none of them do nothing right. But
[1:30:05] but I'm keeping the law and I'm doing so
[1:30:07] good. Can I tell you the problem? But
[1:30:08] this is free tonight. Let me tell you
[1:30:09] the problem with the mountain of
[1:30:10] legalism. It causes you to look down on
[1:30:13] everybody else. Hello. That's free.
[1:30:16] &gt;&gt; The mountain of legalism cause you to
[1:30:17] look down on everybody else. But let me
[1:30:19] tell you this, friends. It might shake
[1:30:20] you up a bit, but we weren't called to
[1:30:22] have a Mount Si religion.
[1:30:25] &gt;&gt; Hello, somebody. We weren't called to a
[1:30:27] Mount Si religion. That that's not our
[1:30:30] calling, man. You remember the man
[1:30:31] telling brother Brandham about about the
[1:30:33] revelation that happened in in
[1:30:35] Revelation 7th chapter. He was trying to
[1:30:37] explain to brother Brandham what he saw
[1:30:38] and how brother Brandham's doctrine was
[1:30:40] wrong. And and and he he says, "I saw,"
[1:30:42] he said, "John saw her." Revelation 7,
[1:30:44] he quotes it. He said, "John saw the
[1:30:46] bride standing on Mount Si. And then he
[1:30:49] saw the bride that was standing in
[1:30:50] heaven. Then he saw the dragon that was
[1:30:52] that was uh uh spewing uh uh uh water
[1:30:55] out of his mouth to make war with the
[1:30:57] remnant of her seed." And brother Bam,
[1:30:59] he said, when he gets to telling the
[1:31:00] guy, he says, "Well, you got it all
[1:31:02] wrong." He said, "Because you're calling
[1:31:03] that bride, and it's not bride." He
[1:31:05] said, "The Jews will stand on Mount Si.
[1:31:08] There's 144,000. But the bride is in
[1:31:10] heaven with Jesus and the dragon that
[1:31:12] was spurting the water to make war with
[1:31:15] the remnant of the woman's seed. He said
[1:31:17] that is the sanctified church. That's
[1:31:19] those that were sanctified but didn't
[1:31:21] receive the Holy Ghost. They will be
[1:31:23] made war with by the dragon. So he said,
[1:31:26] here's three tribes and don't you, he
[1:31:28] said, always keep these three in mind.
[1:31:29] One, there was 144,000. Two, it was a
[1:31:32] great redeemed bride that was in heaven.
[1:31:34] Three, it was the remnant that was left
[1:31:36] there. He said, "See the Jews, they were
[1:31:38] sealed. There was 144,000. That's the
[1:31:41] ones that sanctifies. They they refused
[1:31:43] uh to get the Holy Ghost and the church
[1:31:45] will persecute against them." So So
[1:31:47] there's three the 144,000 they he said
[1:31:50] when they come the the the the'll be
[1:31:52] God's servants will come. When the Holy
[1:31:54] Ghost gospel is preached to them,
[1:31:55] they'll receive the baptism of the Holy
[1:31:57] Ghost just like they did in the
[1:31:59] beginning. The Gentile dispensation is
[1:32:00] finished. The church is sealed away. He
[1:32:02] said, ' See, whenever that gospel is
[1:32:04] preached to them, those 144,000 will
[1:32:06] receive the Holy Ghost just like they
[1:32:08] did. He said, 'But there will be a group
[1:32:10] that's left, a remnant that's left that
[1:32:12] were sanctified that refuse the Holy
[1:32:14] Ghost, and that's the ones that'll have
[1:32:16] to go through tribulation. I thought,
[1:32:18] isn't that something? Do you think about
[1:32:19] what sanctification even means? It's to
[1:32:21] be holy. Think about it. It's a
[1:32:23] holiness. It's a It's those that would
[1:32:25] live a law. They would live a letter of
[1:32:27] a law. They would come to this place of
[1:32:29] sanctification, but they never could
[1:32:31] enter in to the baptism of the Holy
[1:32:34] Ghost. He said they didn't even make a
[1:32:35] rapture because the only way to make a
[1:32:37] rapture is by the baptism of the Holy
[1:32:39] Ghost.
[1:32:40] &gt;&gt; So, it's not those that are sanctified
[1:32:42] that are living by that law. So, here,
[1:32:44] brother Brandham differentiates Mount Si
[1:32:47] as a place that is a gathering for the
[1:32:49] Jews. I know some of y'all didn't amen
[1:32:50] that when I said it the first time, but
[1:32:52] but I'm going to read you something else
[1:32:54] that you will. But but but but here on
[1:32:56] Mount Si, it's where the ten
[1:32:58] commandments came. It's where the ten
[1:32:59] commandments came to Moses. It was all
[1:33:01] law. It was all about legalism. It was
[1:33:03] the law of death. And until Christ came,
[1:33:05] it was good enough. But then brother
[1:33:07] Bannon said in the message, a hidden
[1:33:09] life in Christ, he said, Mount Si is a
[1:33:12] place of duty, but Mount Calvary is a
[1:33:14] place of grace. He said, "And people are
[1:33:17] still trying to live on Mount Si. If I
[1:33:20] go to church and I pay my dues, if I do
[1:33:22] this or that, I'll quit or stop this."
[1:33:24] HE SAID, "BUT THAT'S STILL ON MOUNT SI."
[1:33:26] But when you come to a place where
[1:33:28] you're dead and your life is hid in God
[1:33:30] through Christ, sealed by the Holy
[1:33:32] Ghost, the whole Christian life becomes
[1:33:34] a great glorious shout and a hallelujah
[1:33:37] to you then because you're hid away in
[1:33:39] him daily. Friends, let me tell you
[1:33:42] again, we're not living a Mount Si
[1:33:44] religion. I'm not looking to go have a
[1:33:46] Mount Si religion. It's another mountain
[1:33:48] that my eyes are on. AND IT AIN'T BACK
[1:33:51] IN THE LAND of Israel, BUT IT'S ON MOUNT
[1:33:53] CALVARY WHERE JESUS PAID THE PRICE for
[1:33:56] the sin of all humanity. That's the
[1:33:58] mountain that our eyes are on. And the
[1:34:00] prophet said that great Jehovah, he
[1:34:02] thundered off Mount Si and he wrote the
[1:34:04] commandments. He's the same Jehovah that
[1:34:07] thundered off of Mount Calvary AND SAID,
[1:34:09] "IT IS FINISHED." WHEN MOSES CAME down
[1:34:11] and the thunderings WERE WRITTEN IN LAW,
[1:34:14] BUT THAT SAME JESUS OR THAT SAME GOD ON
[1:34:16] MOUNT CALVARY, HE THUNDERED, "IT IS
[1:34:18] FINISHED.
[1:34:20] He said the word of God what was
[1:34:21] finished. He was wounded for our
[1:34:23] transgression, bruised for our
[1:34:25] iniquities. The chastisement of our
[1:34:27] peace was upon him. By his stripes we
[1:34:30] were healed. It is finished.
[1:34:32] &gt;&gt; He says, "So tonight,
[1:34:34] let us look to Calvary to where it is
[1:34:37] finished at. And let us accept it for by
[1:34:40] grace we are saved through faith,
[1:34:43] knowing it is your calling and
[1:34:45] election." See which mountain are you
[1:34:47] looking to say it's not a mount si
[1:34:51] religion it's a mount calvary religion
[1:34:54] which mountain are you looking to Isaiah
[1:34:57] said as a music players want to come
[1:34:59] Isaiah said hearken to me you that
[1:35:01] follow after righteousness you that seek
[1:35:04] the Lord but look unto the rock whence
[1:35:08] you were heuned
[1:35:11] in the hole in the pit where you were
[1:35:13] digged I got news for you friends we
[1:35:15] weren't heuned
[1:35:17] out of the stone of Mount Si.
[1:35:20] &gt;&gt; We were heuned out of the rock of Mount
[1:35:22] Calvary.
[1:35:24] &gt;&gt; That's where this church came from.
[1:35:27] &gt;&gt; This body of believers, this bride of
[1:35:28] Jesus Christ today, as you stand to your
[1:35:31] feet, we weren't hewing out of the Mount
[1:35:34] Si rock. We was he out of the Mount
[1:35:36] Calvary rock.
[1:35:38] &gt;&gt; We come from Jesus Christ, the law of
[1:35:41] life,
[1:35:43] &gt;&gt; the law of grace.
[1:35:46] that has been given to the children of
[1:35:48] God.
[1:35:49] &gt;&gt; Friends, I don't know about you, but I
[1:35:52] want a Mount Calvary religion.
[1:35:54] &gt;&gt; I didn't get where all I wanted to go
[1:35:56] tonight, but I think that's a good place
[1:35:59] to stop. A Mount Calvary religion.
[1:36:04] I can't think of anything anything else
[1:36:06] that's greater.
[1:36:09] Brother Mark, look where we come from.
[1:36:12] Isaiah said, "Look to the rock that you
[1:36:16] came from."
[1:36:18] Isn't it something? It's so easy to look
[1:36:20] to the wrong mountain.
[1:36:22] Look to the wrong that we weren't he out
[1:36:24] of that rock. We were huned out of the
[1:36:26] rock of Calvary.
[1:36:29] So, see, it was him, his righteousness,
[1:36:32] not our own.
[1:36:34] It's a constant struggle to every
[1:36:37] believer that really has a desire to
[1:36:40] serve God. It's a constant struggle in
[1:36:43] our mind, in our heart, is that that I
[1:36:47] want to do enough good to be pleasing
[1:36:50] unto God. And you should have that
[1:36:52] desire.
[1:36:53] But I'm going to tell you this tonight,
[1:36:55] and I want you to catch what what my
[1:36:56] purpose of speaking this tonight is that
[1:36:59] no matter how much good you do, it'll
[1:37:02] never pay the price. It'll never make
[1:37:04] you worthy. It ain't going to give you a
[1:37:08] a way into heaven. then it don't matter
[1:37:10] how much good you do. See, that ain't
[1:37:13] the that's not the rock that we're to
[1:37:15] look to. Look to the rock that you were
[1:37:17] heuned from.
[1:37:19] It's so easy to allow that. You see, you
[1:37:21] see why I say this? Because it's so easy
[1:37:25] to put our faith in the wrong things.
[1:37:29] Remember the context. The devil's trying
[1:37:31] to put our faith in something else so
[1:37:34] that it doesn't have the power that it
[1:37:36] should have. So, if he can get you to
[1:37:38] put your faith in your works and your
[1:37:41] faith and your Christian walk and your
[1:37:43] works as a as a believer, then you'll
[1:37:46] never have any power supernaturally.
[1:37:49] You'll never be able to move on with God
[1:37:52] because Satan has caused you to put your
[1:37:54] faith in the wrong place. Look, it's a
[1:37:56] treaty.
[1:37:57] Put your faith in your works. Put your
[1:38:00] faith in you. Put your faith in how good
[1:38:02] of a Christian you can be.
[1:38:05] But that ain't where our faith belongs.
[1:38:07] Oh, I love it. Look to the rock from
[1:38:10] where you were heuned.
[1:38:14] Said when his the spear pierced his
[1:38:16] side. All of them that ever belonged to
[1:38:19] him as it was poured out onto the
[1:38:21] ground, they were paid for right there
[1:38:23] on Calvar's cross. Every sin, ever, no
[1:38:26] matter how much you ever do in your
[1:38:27] life, it'll never make it'll never pay
[1:38:29] pay for what Jesus done on that cross.
[1:38:33] He paid the price. Said, "Put your faith
[1:38:36] in the right thing. Put your faith in
[1:38:39] the right mountain."
[1:38:41] Amen. I wonder how many tonight
[1:38:44] say, "Brother man, that's what that's
[1:38:46] what I want to do. I want to look." How
[1:38:48] many lift your hands? Say, "Lord, let me
[1:38:50] look to the the mountain that I was
[1:38:52] heuned from. That's where we were cut
[1:38:54] out of." Amen. And then it don't matter
[1:38:56] what the devil comes by and says, "Well,
[1:38:59] you can't you can't be a real Christian,
[1:39:02] you know, cuz after all, I I'm not going
[1:39:04] to bust you out, but I know some things
[1:39:06] you were thinking that nobody else
[1:39:08] knows." Isn't that what the devil does?
[1:39:12] I know something you looked at nobody
[1:39:13] else saw you, but I know it.
[1:39:17] See, he's trying to take your faith.
[1:39:21] said, "Well, devil, let me tell you,
[1:39:24] I'm not going to make a treaty with you
[1:39:27] because I've already made mine.
[1:39:30] It was made on Mount Calvary.
[1:39:33] And I'm not good enough anyway. So, you
[1:39:35] can tell me that all you want to. You
[1:39:37] can talk about me if you want to. And
[1:39:39] devil, I got news for you. I know stuff
[1:39:41] about me you don't even know.
[1:39:44] I've done a lot worse than you know.
[1:39:48] No matter how how ugly of a picture that
[1:39:50] he paints,
[1:39:52] look to the rock that you were huned.
[1:39:57] That's where our salvation is.
[1:40:00] Look to the rock where you were heuned.
[1:40:02] You're a son of God. You're a daughter
[1:40:04] of God. You belong to God. You're a
[1:40:05] believer. You're a Christian.
[1:40:08] You're united in faith by the Holy
[1:40:11] Ghost. You're part of the body. That's
[1:40:13] why you're here.
[1:40:15] Don't you think I know what that devil
[1:40:17] does?
[1:40:20] Give me some liberty. Let me tell you
[1:40:21] what the devil does. He tells you you're
[1:40:24] not a part of the body.
[1:40:27] It ain't a secret. He tells you you're
[1:40:29] not a part of the body and you don't
[1:40:32] belong and you don't fit in.
[1:40:36] He'll take anything anybody does, walks
[1:40:38] by you, any little thing, and convince
[1:40:41] you you're not a part.
[1:40:44] But don't look to that mountain. Look to
[1:40:48] the rock you were heuned from and say,
[1:40:50] "Devil, I didn't pay the price for me. I
[1:40:53] didn't pay it. I didn't have the ability
[1:40:56] to pay it." But Christ paid it. And when
[1:40:59] he paid it, it made me a part of the
[1:41:01] body of Christ.
[1:41:04] Christ done that. Therefore, I'm a part
[1:41:06] of the body because of what he done. It
[1:41:08] don't matter what anybody else does.
[1:41:10] Don't matter if they frown or if they're
[1:41:11] happy or they may be having a good day,
[1:41:13] a bad day. They don't matter. It has
[1:41:15] nothing to do with it. I'm a part of the
[1:41:17] body because Christ made a way.
[1:41:21] Amen. Look to the rock that you were
[1:41:24] heuned.
[1:41:26] But remember said it's a uniting time of
[1:41:28] God and his bride. I say this with
[1:41:30] reverence and respect. I believe that
[1:41:33] the bride of Christ is called. I believe
[1:41:34] she is sealed in the kingdom of God. I
[1:41:37] believe the mechanics is there. They're
[1:41:39] waiting for the dynamics that'll take
[1:41:41] her off the earth into glory in the
[1:41:43] rapture. I believe it with all my heart.
[1:41:46] Yes, sir. We don't know how he's going
[1:41:48] to do it, but he shall do it. He is the
[1:41:51] dynamics. And we just become members of
[1:41:54] the machine of his body, forming oursel
[1:41:57] into his image. And see him uniting
[1:42:00] himself with us in his works, with his
[1:42:02] love gifts as he hands them to us just
[1:42:04] before the wedding supper. And we're
[1:42:06] waiting and watching for that. How
[1:42:09] many's there with me tonight? We're just
[1:42:11] waiting and and watching with that. We
[1:42:13] just become members of God's great
[1:42:15] machine. Lord, wherever you want to use
[1:42:17] me. It don't matter. See, the devil
[1:42:20] can't trip me no more. They don't use
[1:42:21] me. I'm too big. I'm too He can't trick
[1:42:24] me. I'm just fitting into God's machine.
[1:42:27] Lord, wherever you need me, let me just
[1:42:28] fit into the machine that when the
[1:42:30] dynamics come, I can be carried off this
[1:42:32] earth.
[1:42:34] The devil's a disruptor.
[1:42:36] I know I'm hammering a spirit. He's a
[1:42:39] disruptor. But let me tell you something
[1:42:41] tonight. He lost the battle.
[1:42:43] &gt;&gt; You know why? Because the next time
[1:42:45] tonight or tomorrow, whenever he comes
[1:42:46] by and tries to convince you of all that
[1:42:48] nonsense, you say, "I'm going to look to
[1:42:50] the rock from which I was he. It ain't
[1:42:52] the rock of legalism. It ain't the rock
[1:42:54] of It ain't the rock of some
[1:42:55] denomination. It ain't the the rock of
[1:42:57] somebody else's way of belief or the way
[1:43:00] I should live. It's the rock of Calvary.
[1:43:03] I'm going to look to the rock of from
[1:43:04] which I was heuned. And you keep your
[1:43:07] head up as a believer and you go on and
[1:43:09] serve God. Take another step higher in
[1:43:12] your walk of faith, knowing that the
[1:43:15] only righteousness we have is in Jesus
[1:43:17] Christ. Pick yourself up and be a
[1:43:19] daughter of God. Pick yourself up and be
[1:43:21] a son of God. Oh my. I wish you could
[1:43:24] see the devil right now and you could
[1:43:27] just turn around and tell him, "Devil,
[1:43:28] you're a liar." Somebody just say it out
[1:43:29] loud.
[1:43:31] I love to tell him. I people think I'm
[1:43:33] crazy right in the middle of the store.
[1:43:34] I I don't care to stop and just tell
[1:43:36] him, "Devil, some thought comes by."
[1:43:38] DEVIL, YOU'RE A LIAR.
[1:43:40] I won't think that. That's a lie. I
[1:43:44] wouldn't think that about Travis anyway.
[1:43:47] He's my brother. Devil, you're a liar.
[1:43:50] Hey man, you're you're believers. Look
[1:43:53] to the rock from which you were here.
[1:43:55] Let's bow our heads. Gracious heavenly
[1:43:56] father,
[1:43:58] Lord, we just ask you tonight, Lord,
[1:44:01] God, by the leading of your spirit,
[1:44:03] Lord, as you would speak to this body of
[1:44:06] believers,
[1:44:08] Lord, knowing the very places in our
[1:44:11] life, Lord, that we need the help and
[1:44:14] the the direction and Lord, the very
[1:44:17] things that need to be said. Lord, I
[1:44:18] know how the devil, Lord, I could many
[1:44:21] nights, Lord, laying in prayer for the
[1:44:23] church and God, and just feeling the
[1:44:26] pressure of people that God, maybe
[1:44:28] somebody said something to them to make
[1:44:30] them feel bad about their self or their
[1:44:33] walk. And God, some condescending word,
[1:44:37] but Lord, we ain't even going to hold it
[1:44:39] against them. Lord, I pray that you'd
[1:44:41] give them the courage just to be able to
[1:44:43] stand up on thy word. God, let their
[1:44:46] faith mix with the word that was
[1:44:47] preached tonight. Lord, let it bring
[1:44:49] about a supernatural result in their
[1:44:51] life. Lord, I ask you to have your way,
[1:44:54] Lord, in each one. Lord, we thank you
[1:44:56] for it now. In Jesus name we pray.
[1:45:03] Amazing grace
[1:45:10] will always be
[1:45:12] my song of praise.
[1:45:20] It was great
[1:45:24] that
[1:45:27] my liberty
[1:45:40] how you came
[1:45:43] to love me so.
[1:45:48] But you look beyond
[1:45:54] my faults and saw
[1:45:58] my need.
[1:46:03] I shall ever
[1:46:13] to
[1:46:18] you the cross
[1:46:23] where Jesus
[1:46:26] died.

[1:46:44] soul.

[1:47:02] Amazing
[1:47:07] that brought me out
[1:47:11] of darkness
[1:47:17] into
[1:47:19] the light
[1:47:22] where I can clear
[1:47:26] see.
[1:47:31] I shall be from
[1:47:37] the mountains
[1:47:39] and the
[1:47:52] I fall
[1:47:54] so my knees.

[1:48:25] for me.

[1:48:40] that
[1:48:45] He know

[1:50:12] forever
[1:50:18] and all my labor.
[1:50:26] I do not know
[1:50:32] just how he came to love me. So
[1:50:46] all my forms
[1:50:49] on my knees.
[1:51:01] Lift my eyes
[1:51:04] to Calary
[1:51:09] to view the cross.
[1:51:15] When Jesus
[1:51:17] died,
[1:51:21] he died for me.
[1:51:24] How long
[1:51:29] the graces
[1:51:31] that called my falling
[1:51:35] soul.

[1:51:51] Aren't you thankful for his grace? It
[1:51:54] was God's grace
[1:51:58] that brought me out of darkness
[1:52:07] into
[1:52:09] the light
[1:52:12] where I can clearly
[1:52:17] see.
[1:52:21] So I'll shout it from
[1:52:26] the mountains
[1:52:29] and the valleyies.
[1:52:35] Oh, he looked me all.
[1:52:40] Yes. All my faults and he saw my need.
[1:52:46] Oh, can you lift your hands and sing it
[1:52:48] now? I shall forever
[1:52:55] live.
[1:52:57] Oh, aren't you thankful for Calvary
[1:53:00] tonight?
[1:53:02] Oh, for his grace that was shown to you
[1:53:05] the cross

[1:53:29] soul.

[1:54:05] owe I owed a debt. We all needed someone
[1:54:07] to come wash us. And he went up that
[1:54:10] hill and he said whenever he pierced his
[1:54:12] side, every single one that was birthed
[1:54:14] came out of him. Washed by the blood.
[1:54:16] Aren't you thankful for that? Oh, he
[1:54:19] paid a debt. He did not owe I owed a
[1:54:25] debt. I could not pay. I needed someone.

[1:57:58] to go. Heavenly Father, Lord, we just
[1:57:59] want to come before you. Lord, we're
[1:58:02] thankful for Calvary, Father.
[1:58:05] Oh, we're thankful for the grace that
[1:58:06] was shown to us, oh God. Father, for
[1:58:09] paying our debt that day, oh God, we

[1:58:14] want to show our gratitude by doing that
[1:58:16] which pleases you, oh God. Father, I
[1:58:18] pray you would just bless our pastor,
[1:58:20] Father, for pouring out his heart, Lord.
[1:58:22] Lord, coming before the people and
[1:58:25] preaching it straight, Father. Preaching
[1:58:26] it true, Father. I'm thankful for a
[1:58:28] pastor that'll do that, Father, that
[1:58:30] won't hold nothing back, but will give
[1:58:32] it to us, Father. Straight and true,
[1:58:34] Father. I'm thankful for that, Lord. And
[1:58:36] I just thank you for your word tonight,
[1:58:38] Father. I pray you would just be with us
[1:58:40] now, Father, as we'd go to our places of
[1:58:42] home, Father. May you just watch over
[1:58:44] us, keep us safe, Father. I know the
[1:58:46] storm's coming in, Father. But I Lord,
[1:58:48] I'm thankful. I know the master of the
[1:58:50] wind, Father. Lord, whatever would come,
[1:58:52] Father. I pray you just protect each
[1:58:54] one, Lord. Watch over each one. Keep
[1:58:56] everybody safe. Father, I pray you be
[1:58:58] with those that are sick at home.
[1:58:59] Father, may you give him a healing
[1:59:01] touch, Lord. Those that are traveling,
[1:59:02] be with our brother Andrew as he's on
[1:59:04] the missions field. Father, use them in
[1:59:06] a mighty way. Lord, I pray you just be
[1:59:08] with us now as we would go. Father, we

[1:59:15] amen. Well, let's just sing that again
[1:59:18] as we dismiss. And one day come back for
[1:59:24] me to live with him eternally.
[1:59:29] Won't it be glory?
[1:59:33] Oh, to see him home that day.
[1:59:38] I then shall sing a brand new song.
[1:59:43] Amazing grace. Hold it home. Christ
