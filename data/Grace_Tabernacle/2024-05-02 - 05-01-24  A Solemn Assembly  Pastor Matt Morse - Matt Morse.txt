going to have to bear with me this evening but the Lord spoke to my heart and so I just try to obey the Lord to may not may not do everything right but if I don't get everything right in this world

an awesome God and he's worthy of it and sure good glad to see some of our brothers and sisters uh back uh this evening we have some prayer requests this unspoken prayer request from sister Jasmine also a prayer request for py land very needed a prayer request for Ronnie Conley just remember him in prayer and that prayer request for uh Brother David Gates in prayer is blood pressure we just need to the Lord to move on his situation and I believe God knows each one of us where there's many great needs and and but we just want to call upon the name of the Lord tonight amen amen you believe that he's more than able how how many come to get something from the Lord amen hope he didn't come to get something from me I wouldn't have much to give but I know that God does Amen if we can take something out of his word and and take uh the word word of God and feed it to the church and I believe that it's it's lifegiving food it's something that could sustain us through our journey and and I believe that we come in this service uh to meet the Lord and you know I know we have an adversary that would meet us here tonight to prevent you from moving any further with God but I believe that we have a greater one that's on our side he's a he's more than a conqueror and I believe that he has everything under his control can I read you this before we go a word of prayer this is a prayer from a prophet of God he said most gracious father it is a grand privilege to know that we can begin this service tonight in a scriptural order for in the scriptures we read that music went before the battle they played the songs and then the Ark of the Covenant followed then the fight was on and tonight after the most lovely music has been played and the songs have been sung and now we shall bring the word then may the battle be on we pray oh God that the angels of God would take their positions in every corner and at every aisle and every seat in this building May there be such an an oldtime conviction until there cannot be one person walk in this building as a sinner and go out the same thing and May whosoever comes in unsaved may God save them for the glory of his kingdom how many say amen that's my prayer tonight Lord won't we just bow our heads gracious Heavenly Father Lord you hear our prayer Lord tonight Lord God as a body of Believers Lord realizing our inabilities and the weaknesses that we have and but God we come to rely upon you tonight Lord we give you this service Lord we ask you to take your place Lord and to be able to minister to our hearts and Lord we ask every the angels of heaven Lord to take their positions tonight Lord and God May every Spirit Lord that is unlike you any Spirit of evil Lord that would keep the children of God from growing in the word of God and Lord may you come tonight and drive it out of this place and Lord may this be a place of worship Lord and God may be a place of love and a place of growth and Lord a place where your word can go forth and be manifested and Lord we ask you Lord that you would move in a special way tonight Lord help us to get out of the way and Lord this little scripture that you placed on My Heart Lord I pray God it would find its resting place Lord may your word go forth Lord we ask you now in the name of Jesus Christ we pray amen amen God bless you tonight we want to read out of the Book of Joel and we'll start in the first chapter and we're going to read from the first verse and amen I just uh just say it's good to be in the house of the Lord amen one more time time and and we just love his word how many love his word amen how many's been reading your Bible this week amen now now you got to be honest in the presence of the Lord amen how may spent spent some time praying and getting closer to God this week amen now we got to be honest amen you love the Lord amen I believe that's something we ought to do every day take a little bit of time and I know it I know you can't do it all day long we have work to do and jobs and things like that but you know to take some time a little bit of time and dedicate it to the Lord and just let the devil know that's God's time it's a good thing it'll strengthen you as a Believer I believe that and it's always been that way for me it's always been that case but I want to read out of the Book of Joel in the first chapter in the first verse and the Bible says the word of the Lord that came to Joel the son of pethel hear this ye old men and give ear all the inhabitants of the land hath this been in your days or even in the days of your fathers tell ye your children of it and let your children tell their children and their children another generation that which the pal worm have left ha the Locust eaten and that which the Locust hath left had the cankerworm eaten and that which the cankerworm hath left had the caterpillar eaten I also want to read from the 15th verse the Bible says alas for the day for the day of the Lord is at hand and as a destruction from the almighty shall it come and then I also want to read from Joel the 2 chapter this is our favorite portion of this scripture that many of us quote out of the 23rd verse and the Bible says and I will restore to you the years that the Locust hath eaten the cankerworm and the caterpillar and the Palmer worm my great Army which I sent among you we'll just ask the Lord to add His blessings uh to the reading of his word as you take your seats and I want to speak on uh this subject tonight on a solemn assembly I know that uh that this is a this is a great age how many believes that tonight that we're we're living in the greatest age the Bible prophesies we could go through we could go through hours of scripture that talks about the age that we live in and the condition of the age and uh it's it's not something that is that is hard to identify by by Bible prophecy uh to identify that we're living in this age or the end time but uh although we're living in this great age I believe it's time for God's Church to be at its best I me say Amen to that I I don't believe that we're uh that you know that we're living in something small but brother Mark if we're living in the day of great evil then it's a day that'll take great courage to be able uh to overcome it but you know what I believe that God's church will fulfill every promise that God said she would amen I believe that she'll be everything God said she would be I don't believe there's one thing in the scripture that God ever spoke of his church that she's not going to fulfill in this age I happen to believe that I don't believe there's any other age coming I believe we're in the final age I don't believe there's another church coming I believe we are the final church I don't believe there's another people coming I believe we are the people of God that has been written about for thousands of years and I don't know about you but I believe that what the prophets prophesied she' be here I believe what they prophesied she'd become and I just want to live in that amen I believe that I believe we're in that age and I believe we'll be that and you know I I I read this scripture and of course we read this many times and many quote this scripture and and that God will restore and uh but most whenever they read this brother Mark they say God will restore but we fail to see how God would restore the church and uh you know the Lord this is the scripture the Lord had had had spoke to my heart today in the 14th verse of Joel chapter 1 he says but sanctify you a fast and call a solemn assembly gather the elders and all the inhabitants of the land into the house of the Lord your God and cry unto the Lord I thought isn't that something to he that God was telling them the condition of the church and the condition of of the of the age and he said but if you want to have a restored Church here's what you do he says you call a solom a L and you gather the elders into the house of the Lord and and then you cry unto the Lord I thought why wouldn't that be a fine message to preach tonight to gather and to call and to cry unto the Lord here we come together tonight We Gather in the house of God every time we come in the house of God brother Mark We Gather in a place uh an Assembly of God We Gather in the house of the Lord but but the Bible says but call a solemn assembly and may uh be prepared for the Lord friends let me tell you if you want to have a restored Church GA call and cry unto the Lord if you want to have a church that's moving then I believe that God has called for his church to be restored I I don't believe that it should remain in the condition it was in Joel chapter 1 I I think that there's many that read that and I got news for you that God has already brought us out of it this ain't a a church that's that's in a stump somewhere that's been aten down or or eaten down and that don't have no life in it or don't have no power in it but I believe that God called for a living church if you believe that say amen I believe he called for a church to demonstrate the power of God how many believes that say amen I don't believe that we're an idol church I don't believe that we're a church that's supposed to watch and see the things that are going on I believe God's church is an active church I believe he called her in this age to be active to actively manifest the word of God and and actively manifest the power of God and actively demonstrate the power of almighty God that's the kind of church that God has called in the end time and you know I think about the churches today and I think sometimes the church forgets what their purpose is and I got to look through the scripture I thought you know if you go through the scripture and then find out what is the purpose of the church anyhow what do what do God caus us to do and and you know you could find many scriptures that would speak about this but the the the Lord led me to one place of after the resurrection had taken place and do you realize what was the first commission that the angel gave after Jesus resurrected from the dead how many remember the scripture Matthew 20 in the 28th chapter and the Bible says but the angel of the Lord told them to declare his resurrection remember when Mary Magdalene and Mary and they came down to the tomb and and they were looking to find Jesus in that dead State they were looking to find him in grave clothes they were looking to find him buried up in a tomb they were looking to find him in the place that they had last saw him but when they came down there looking for something dead they met an angel of the Lord said there's no death here but all you're going to find is life there there's nothing down there there's no Darkness here the darkness has fled and you're going to find light and the Bible says and the angel answered and said unto them fear you not for I know that you seek after Jesus which was crucified glory to God but he said but he is not here for He Is Risen and he said come and see the place where the Lord lay and go quickly and tell his disciples that he is risen from the dead and behold he goeth before you into Galilee and there you shall see him Lo have I told you then the Bible said and they departed quickly from the SRE with fear and with great joy and they did run to bring his disciples the word I thought isn't it something the angel of the lord gave them a word from the Lord and said you go tell them that Jesus Christ has raised from the dead you go tell them that that that there ain't nothing dead here but there's life and brother B brother bam took this very same scripture and and brother Jared he preached a message out of it called go tell he said you know it doesn't do you so much good to go if you haven't got something to tell so not only did he send them but he sent with the message he say so I think that's been a whole lot of the trouble today we go to tell but when we go we have nothing to tell there's nothing of any benefit there's nothing that would help people friends you can look at the church world today it's a world full of people that go and do and do all they can do but there's no message to tell but I thank God today that the Bride of Jesus Christ is not is not empty of a message but in the in the work that we had to do and all the going that we had to do I thank God that He gave us a message that we could teare when we got to our destination then he says the speaking of the Angel the angel said now you go preach it and you show these signs that I am alive from the dead this is the purpose of the church but said what a message it was go tell and go show my disciples these things that you have seen that I am not dead but I am risen from the dead oh my isn't it something that was the message from the angel you you think about he said take the Angel's message and you go spread it to the disciples there there was a great evangelist by the name of Charles Spurgeon he said one time he said whenever you get the chance to play the angel then go play the angel I thank God that we've had an opportunity in this hour to play the angel I thank God we've had an opportunity to take the message of the Angel and you go tell it to the world it it ain't just some dead message butor but it was a message of the resurrection of Jesus Christ what a message that the angel gave her you go preach of his resurrection you go talk about his resurrection and the Bible said when they went out with a message from the angel and they told of the work that that had been done that Jesus Christ ain't laying in no tomb but he's alive and well you tell him I'm a resurrected savior you tell him that the prophecy of David has been fulfilled you tell him that death has been conquered you tell them I went down into Hell and Hell has lost its power you tell them I put the devil in his place and the grave couldn't hold me any longer he said you go and tell them when you get there that Jesus Christ is Resurrected we got a living message it ain't a dead message we've got a living message we've been caught by the angel of the Lord to tell the world of the living savior that's been resurrected in this hour it ain't some dead Church going by but I thank God I've got something I can share that'll bring life to a body of people this message is Alive and Well I wonder if there's somebody out there can testify about it tonight it ain't just alive for everybody it's alive in me let me be a testimony the message of the hour of the resurrection of Jesus Christ Play The Angel Play The Angel and tell the message he's alive and well you know there's a story glory to God hallelujah you know there's a story of a little boy one time he went out and many of the young men had been called brother Mark to to go running this race there was about 150 of them came together they come up to the beginning of the race and said 'w what we're going to do is we're going to give you a p phrase and when you get to the end of the F the race then you know the first one there you just tell the man the past phrase he'll let you in you're going to win the great prize so the boy began to prepare did all the work that he could and he built up and he gained strength done endurance test and ran many miles before the race and got all his strength built up he thought you know there's one thing I I'm pretty strong on my body I'm not going to let them them pipsqueaks beat me I'm going to I'm I'm going to beat them so he went to strengthen it up he did everything right got real strong and got his endurance and got to learn learned how he could he could make the short cuts in the track so finally come the day of the race and they lined up on the line little boy line lined up and put his nose right on the wire along with the rest of them as they lined up to say go he he got to looking at his at his competition and man they ain't got nothing on me I know all the tricks I can jump higher than they can I can run faster than they can I can go farther than they can I I I can build better than they can I got a lot matter of fact I got a lot to offer but Mark all of a sudden the gun fired and off they went that boy went to running and Friends he knocked him out of his way he jumped over some he shoved his way he took every short cut that he could he could take and maybe the people that were on looking say my look at the strength of that boy but he got all the way to the end and all the the work his way through the course and he got all the way to the end he waited and to hear the guy at the gay he said what's the password and then all of his training and running and doing and going he forgot the P phrase I couldn't remember I came my I forgot the I forgot what I what I supposed to say when I get here but BR said see and he wasn't even able to enter in he said he forgot what he was running for he said I think that's the condition of the church today is they forgot what they're running for that's the trouble but go tell my disciples that I have raised from the dead and I will meet them in Galilee he said see we forgot the key word we've been so busy with other things making big churches and building big denominations until we forgot the key word but I thank God that we would have a reminder in this hour brother Mah to remember what the key PHA phrase was to go and tell that he's resurrected go and tell that he's still alive go and tell that he's still doing the same word go and tell that he's not a god of yesterday but the Bible said he's the same yesterday today and forever and he's still God the same God that was God for Elijah is God for you the god of Samson is a God for you the god of the Bible is a god of today he's the same God so we got something to go tell go preach the world the gospel you me tell you what those disciples did they went out Brother David whenever they met Jesus he he got to telling them about his coming Kingdom I the preachers here I wish I could he got to tell them about his the kingdom that would be coming into power and he and he told them what would take place and but Mark he was prophesying of what would happen over the next few days but you realize that just a few days later then Jesus laid the very Foundation of that Kingdom that he was going to build here here was some of them old weak Christians that were that were scared about what was going to happen tomorrow like sometimes we feel like but the Bible said Jesus said behold I send the promise of my father upon you tar in the city of Jerusalem until you be endued with power from on high he said see he promised of a coming of a coming Kingdom you go t in this place cuz my kingdom is coming it's going to rise it ain't it ain't going to always look like this it's not these dark days that you've gone through it ain't always going to be that way th this trial that you've gone through it ain't always going to be that way this trouble that you've been facing it ain't always going to be that way but there's a tomorrow coming and when the Sun rises tomorrow my kingdom shall rise with it what was he doing he was promising the church his power there was a promise of power friends and that same Power Glory to God that same power that raised Jesus from the dead the power to heal and the power to raise the dead and the power to open the blinded eyes and the power to make the lame wall and the power to to give sight to the blind that same power Jesus was given to the church the Bible said if that same spirit that raised Christ from the dead dwell in you it'll even Quicken your mortal body this old Mortal body this old flesh body that fails and gets sick and you can't even you don't even have the strength to get out of bed but the Bible said that the spirit that raised Christ from the dead dwell in you it'll even Quicken that old Mortal body that which is going to die and rot in the grave but it'll Quicken it said my it'll turn you around oh friends it'll turn your it'll turn this old flesh around it'll give it'll give a dead man it'll give him his life oh friends let me ask you this question if it'll give a dead man his life what will it do to a dead Church hello somebody it'll give a dead Church their life back too it'll give her it'll it'll give them a restored life again when it had gone down Through the Ages till it didn't have no breath in it any longer but when the power of God would come back to it it would give life back to God's church let me tell you and God's been changing lives ever since ever since the power of God fell down upon those men he's been changing lives ever since when they come out of the upper room and hearts and lives were changed and turned to Jesus Christ he ain't ever stopped it since 2,000 years later the same message still has the same power still has the same result it'll still take a drunk and it'll bring him in the house of God it'll still take a drug addict and deliver him from drugs it'll still take a prostitute and it'll take her off the street and establish her in the house of God hallelujah it'll take a cold formal dead Church religion and it'll turn them into a spiritual Powerhouse he'll take a dead Church it'll give them life again he'll take those that have have went back on God brother Mark it'll give them strength again oh Hallelujah see but somebody somebody's got to meet the devil's challenge you realize the devil's put a challenge on God's Church somebody's got to meet his challenge you say well what's his challenge listen his challenge is the church has lost its power how many ever heard him say it his challenge is that God can't save Sinners anymore this is the devil's challenge there ain't no true conversions anymore everybody just kind of goes through the motions and join churches and they feel good and that's what makes them come back it's all about emotions there ain't no true conversion nobody can be filled with the Holy Ghost no more that was just for the disciples that was just for the apostles that that was that wasn't for us you may as well give up on your children they'll never be saved anyway they're too far gone they've done blaspheming the Holy Ghost the Revival's over and it ain't coming back that was something for back 50 years ago or 100 years ago but it ain't for now it's the devil's challenge said but see somebody has got to meet the devil's challenge but B say see but when you're going to meet it you ain't going to meet it in a backsliding condition he said see the backsliding condition of the church can't meet the challenge of this hour it's going to take the church coming to another place see so if you're going to meet the challenge then you got to get back to the Revival Revival means life it means take something that was dead and bring it back to life so if you're going to meet the challenge of the devil you're not going to do it in a dead State it'll have to be under Revival say see so here here we're going to take the church back to this revival says so let your heart be stirred sometimes that's what we need brother Jared we need to be stirred we need to be recharged we come to the house of God and we we get so depleted in our spirit we just need to come and hear some this oldfashioned gospel renewing of our spirit we need the Holy Ghost to fall in the house of God and to lift us up into another realm that our mind can get off the things of the world and get back on the things of God that's what God does for us you think about it this is what Samson was doing Sunday we're talking about Samson and how that he went out then he went he went out calling out to God he said see when he called out to God you realize when he called to God he knew that his backsliding condition couldn't meet the challenge of the hour he would never defeat the Philistine in the condition that he was in so he called out to God that God would restore him back to his rightful place that he would be able to defeat the enemy that had him held captive couldn't do it in his backsliding State she had lost his power broken his Covenant let me tell you friends you won't meet you won't meet the challenge of the hour by memorizing quotes you won't meet the challenge of the hour by being the smartest person in the church and and you won't you won't be meet the challenge of the hour by being a cold church or dead church or formal Church like these people of today are trying to put up on the people of God you won't meet the challenge of the hour in that kind of condition it leads the church to be backslid see well how do you do it well there ain't but one way to meet the challenge of the hour is to be a restored church it's to be what God had ordained the church to be you say what are we what are we supposed to be restored to here was Jesus's message he said but you shall receive power after the Holy Ghost has come upon you and you shall be Witnesses unto me both in Jerusalem and Judea and Samaria and to the utmost parts of the world my how powerful is that somebody I want you to I want you to answer me some Theologian if we have any here tonight tell me which of those that was in that that that meeting of those disciples withes Jesus that day tell me which of them went to the utmost parts of the world which of them traveled around the globe and and went to the utmost parts of the earth they never they never hardly went to to another Nation let alone a few hundred miles at the most but never did they travel around the world but Jesus said You shall be Witnesses unto me in Jerusalem Judea Samaria and the utmost parts of the world you say well how would they do it well let me tell you friends because that message wasn't just to them 2,000 years ago but that message was to you and I today that was our promise that was given to God's Church it wasn't just to them disciples it was to the Church of the Living God he said it was a promise according to the prophet Joel he said he said This Promise is unto you and to your children and your children's children and to many and them that are a far off as many as the Lord Our God shall call promise wasn't just to the disciples it was to God's Church how many's a part of his church tonight that means it was to you my don't you think about it brother Mark you know what that does it brings the promise of God right to your Pew this evening it ain't to somebody somewhere else it was to you it was God's promise to you it ain't no different than him standing here tonight and giving you that same instruction to the utmost parts of the earth you'll be my witness in Black Rock Arkansas you'll be my witness by they didn't even know what Black Rock was back then but I thank God there's somebody here that does in Texas you'll be my witness in Oklahoma you'll be my witness in Louisiana there'll be a witness in Africa there'll be a witness in India there'll be a witness to the utmost parts of the earth testifying of the resurrection of Jesus Christ I thank God there's somebody that's willing to be a witness of the message of the hour it brings life oh Hallelujah said there's coming forth of a spiritual church that is a witness of Jesus Christ I it something to be a part of that he said well how will it come I can tell you according to the scripture he said the only way that church would come would be by a Pentecostal experience they would come and they would testify of his resurrection they would testify of his of the supernatural they would testify of his power they would testify of his grace but said there's coming a kingdom of witnesses Hallelujah Glory that makes me want to preach there's coming a kingdom of witnesses Witnesses of his resurrection and Witnesses of his power and Witnesses of his being alive I wonder if there's some of them sitting here tonight say I'm a witness of his healing I'm a witness of his salvation I'm a witness of his resurrection I'm a witness of his Deliverance I'm a witness that whenever you get in trouble that he'll come by and he'll bring you out of it so there there's a coming a kingdom of witnesses that's what we're a part of tonight we're a kingdom of the witnesses of Jehovah God how will it come you say well let me ask you how would it come how did it come how did it ever come how did it come to humanity whenever whenever whenever life first came to the first man that ever walked upon the Earth this is what God's trying to do to bring life into the church how did it come you think about when Adam was setting that day and God had created the Bible says God made Man Out of the Dust of the ground and when he made man do you realize that that man laying there in the dust of the ground he still had no life in you that's what the Bible said all the forming was done now I could preach on that all the form was built perfect it was made just like God had had had intended on it being made everything was just in its place it was so it was so if you it was so formal and ritualistic it was just perfect I'm going to get myself in trouble it was just perfect but it had no life in it everything looked good but it had no life in it but the Bible said but then God breathed into his nostrils am the breath of life and Man became a living Soul God breathed into his nostrils the breath of life I don't have to look no farther to find out where we came from I don't have to look no farther to find out what was my origin brother Mark but I believe when God made man he made them in His image he breathed into his nostrils the breath of life and Man became a living Soul we can trace ourselves all the way back to that very place when God made the first man isn't it something that he that he that he created Life by breath it was a it was the Breath of God he was it was a life-giving breath that I don't have time to read them all but David said this he said by the word of the Lord Heavens were made and by the breath of his mouth job said it like this he said the spirit of God has made me and the breath of the almighty is what gives me life it's the Breath of God brother Mark that brings life into the church isn't that what he done when they went and met him they doubted it was even him when they went to meet him down there on the on the way that day but when he came in there oh doubt and Thomas I don't even know if that's you you don't even look the same how do we know it's really you and the Bible said he showed him the nail prints in his hands and he let him feel the the the the the spear on his side the scar and he said and the Bible said when he had so said he showed them his hands in his side and they were glad that they saw the Lord and then Jesus said unto them peace be unto you as my father has sent me so send I you the same thing about the same message that the angel had given to Mary and Mary Magdalene and now Jesus was sitting in their presence he said the father sent me and so send I you and the Bible said when he done this after he had said it he breathed on them and said unto them receive you the Holy Ghost friends they were a people that had lost Direction they were a men that had lost their their their their CS or they didn't know which way to turn they didn't know where to go when he got put in the Tomb but when he met him again he said is I be not afraid I'm the same one that came walking on the water that day when you was going across in the boat feel my hands and feel the nails car feel where a spear pierced my side and he breathed on them and he said receive the Holy Ghost all of a sudden these men that were lost these men that had no courage these men that were hiding these men that were hiding in their homes it was so bad that Peter he just a few days ago he wouldn't even deny that he even knew who Jesus was they were lost and hiding and afraid but all of a sudden they were close enough to feel the Breath of God can you imagine being that far away oh friends if you could take yourself there a moment if you imagine being that far away and so lost without the Savior the light of the world had gone de he had been buried this great how the Earth had quaked and and the great Darkness had came upon the face of the Earth and fear shook their hearts these men that were so bold when they were standing in his presence and they had got into that shape and now they were went from that and all of a sudden they were close enough to feel his breath I a't it something that's where we want to be tonight close enough to feel the Breath of God close enough that the Bible says he breathed on them oh friends I don't know about you but that's the desire of my heart is for the Lord Jesus to breathe on me in his breath it had the power to give his spirit in his breath the power to to give the Holy Ghost in his breath you realize it was the same breath that spoke at lazarus's tomb that said Lazarus come forth he was the same breath that healed the sick he was the same breath that spoke that that that that spoke water and turned it into wine this great breath of almighty God had breathed upon them receive you the Holy Ghost think of it all of a sudden brother B said that's how the church is born he said the church is born on the of the Breath of God he said when this stature has molded itself up there in condition God's breath breath Breeze upon them Hallelujah receive the Holy Ghost and then you are a son of God you can join anything you want to but you're born into the church of living God you're born by the Breath of God God breathed upon them and said receive you my goodness you're born by the Breath of God it gives you life you're born you you think about think about the prophet Ezekiel he when he went down there and the Bible says he said I was called into this Great Valley when I went out into the valley it was a valley filled with dry bones there wasn't no life in the valley everything was there was dead and dried up and but Mark had no life to it he said but the but the angel that was speaking to him be to tell him glory he began to give him a message he said Can these bones live again what a question to ask him he said oh son of man can they live again how how would I know Lord only you would knowest he said I'll tell you not only will they not only can they but they will he said oh you and he begin to speak to him he saidoh Ezekiel he said prophesy unto them dry bones you take the very mind of God and you begin to speak God's mind and you'll see those bones that have not done they've been laying down there they're all mixed up they don't know what arm goes to what leg they don't they've been so taken apart they don't even know how to put their body back together but the angel of the Lord would come and he'd begin to speak God's word and the arm would know where it was supposed to go and the foot would nowh it's supposed to go and all of a sudden this body that God called the church that was so scattered around the world and had no direction in this last days in the end time that you would see a bone a leg bone connected to a knee bone and a knee bone connected to a hip bone and the body of the church be put back together again he said prophesy you dry bones hear you the word of the Lord and I will cause breath to enter into you that you can live again and it eel said so I prophesied and as I prophesied I heard a great noise and I heard a great Shak and and all of a sudden those bones got to coming up out of the grave and the skin Came Upon the bones and the senu be to show it together and they stood before me as a great Army he said now what he said oh you you're a form of a man you realize brother Mark here they stood but they still had no life he said now what will I do he said you say unto them he said prophesy under the wind prophesy oh son of man and say to the wind thus sayeth the Lord God come from the Four Winds oh breath and breathe upon these slain that they may live oh isn't it something that God gave his Prophet an authority to call upon the wind that he could breathe into them the breath of life that them old dry bones could live again and manifest the life that God had called them to Hallelujah what he prophesied listen he said I'll call you out of the graves I'll restore you to your rightful place and I shall put my spirit in you glory and you shall live and I shall place you in your own land and then you shall know that I the Lord have spoken it and I have performed it sayth the Lord I spoke it and I performed it this is our God God don't speak things idle he said you'll know that I spoke it and then I also performed it I sent the message and then I Vindicated it I it wasn't just something idle I spoke it and then I performed it friends don't you see when they gathered when they them them disciples gathered that day in the upper room brother Mark they went up there they gaed they were afraid they didn't know what was about to happen they were in there scared they prayed They Carried they waited but the Bible says all of the sudden they heard the sound of A rushan Mighty Wind and when that wind of God be to blow through that building little licks of fire that were formed in that place it fell upon them brother Mark can me tell you what it done it took a man that was backslid and gave him the ability to go stand and preach the Gospel of Jesus Christ sometimes that's the condition of the church they get they get so weary and they get so afraid and and they get so worldly and sometimes we get backslid he said but what would it take it will take the Breath of God breathing life back into the church again you say how would he breathe it he'll call somebody to speak the word of God for God's word is life it's the breath of almighty God and it's spoken the believer and they'll manifest what God called them to be this was a man that was afraid it took a man that was backslid named Peter that was so he was so afraid that when they said aren't you one of them Believers I don't even know who Jesus is Oh I thought I saw you down there when he was down in the garden I've never met that man in my life oh I know you're really one of them we' seen you down there on the River Bank he was with Jesus I'm telling you I don't know who he was and the Bible says He was cursing them it took that old coward man and when the Breath of God came blowing through that building that same man went out there and he found him a place he I wish I had a place to stand he found him a place to stand so that everybody could see him he that sometimes you just feel you need to be a little bit taller he found him a good place to stand he said I come to declare unto you that that Jesus that you crucified that God has raised him from the dead and he's gave the very power of Heaven has been given unto him and I come to declare it to you you laid him in a grave but God raised him up what he spoke was true truth he gave a man that was afraid the courage to preach the gospel he gave a people that was backslid that wanted to turn their back on God the C to be restored again brought a Revival to his life let me tell you something it didn't stop God he filled them and then he sent them Hallelujah he said I spoke it and then I performed it he filled them then he sent them that's what's happening today there's too many people that's assembled in fear but it come the Breath of God he filled them and he sent them that's what we need you may how how you may assemble yourselves I don't know how you came tonight I don't know if you come afraid I don't know if you come backslid I don't know if you come to Revival I I don't know that but you know that but God knew how they were assembled think about when we We Gather in this way think we all we all go back and we we quote the apostles and we say well those were God's disciples and you know well God could use them after all they were his disciples they were great men and you know this is what many people quote they say well the disciples or the book of Acts was the framework of the church I believe that but that's not all it was see it's what prophet of God said he said we do not believe that the Acts of the Apostles is just the framework we believe it's the word of God it's the acts of your Holy Spirit in the apostles listen now we believe that the same Holy Spirit Lord that come upon them and the way they acted it'll do the same thing in us when it comes upon us if it's the same spirit that was from a message does God change his mind in 1965 and the whole message was about no God don't change his mind about his word it was it was showing that the same mind of God in the beginning is the same mind of God in the end he said Lord and we believe the same holy spirit that come on them and the way they acted he'll do the same thing in us when it comes on us if it's the same spirit and I still believe that today so let me tell you I can meet the challenge of the devil today don't you come and try to take the move of God out of our Church don't you come and try to take the holy ghost out of this church don't you come and try to take the liberty of the worship of God out of this assembly I believe we have a right to be what they were I believe we have a right to have the same power they had I believe we have a right to talk to the same devil the way they talk to him and to put him in his place but man said the Holy Spirit must be alive in the church always leading the church for the age that it's living in to confirm the word that's promised for that age I believe we have a right listen what Joel said he says sanctify you a fast call a solemn assembly gather the Elders of all the inhabitants of the land into the house of the Lord your God and cry unto the Lord gather call and cry see the word solom it means to take it serious or to be sincere this is what God called for we come to the house of God see there's a sincerity that we come to get something from the Lord I sent brother Tim a message he's asked me about the sermon title and such I said well brother you just pray for me he said I always pray for you you know that's a sincerity to come to the house of God that the Lord will speak to me the Lord will use the the minister that comes to the pull pit or the Lord will anoint the singers that sing We we don't put singers up in front of the church to be something to be a spectacle or to make fun of but we come there and say Lord Lord I pray you'd bless them Lord that it'd be a blessing unto me Lord I pray you'd use them Lord that the spirit of God would be would be welcome in this place don't you realize friends how easy it is to offend the Holy Spirit our attitude and the way we act towards God it's a very timid spirit and sometimes people they just offend God they offend the spirit of God I don't want to offend him I want to make him welcome I want to I want everything that I say and do to make him welcome I wonder how many say Lord let me let me do all I can to make you welome if I if I've done something to offend you Lord I pray you'd forgive me I want to make you welcome in this place it's a solemn assembly we come to take it serious to be sincere and Joel said listen when they come this way he said I will restore to you the gears that the Locust have eaten the cankerworm the caterpillar the palmerworm the great Army which I sent among you and you shall eat in plenty and be be satisfied and praise the name of the Lord your God that ha dwelt wondrously with you and my people shall never be ashamed just the music players would come tonight A solemn assembly I'll restore the church I'll restore her strength I'll restore her power I'll restore her to her rightful place my people shall never be ashamed do you believe that tonight friends when God makes a promise Pro you think about it when God makes a promise he uses you to perform it he uses you to bring it to pass you you you ever think of that every promise when God makes he proves his promise by Believers there's a world of people gathered together in assembly unbelievers they say well I've never seen God move like that I've never seen anybody healed I've never seen the power of God in that way but God don't prove his promises by unbelievers so how would they ever see it God proves his promises by Believers you think about it he shows us this in the scripture when he went down you remember when he was walking that that day and that gyus came to him and he said Lord my daughter's sick would you come and heal her and he went on his journey that way and gyus had gone back to his house and this lady come to him the the the big crowd had gathered around him and after a little while the time had went too far about gone and finally a servant came to him and said Lord don't worry to come by gyus his house because it's too late she's already gone you see he wasn't looking to prove his promise by unbelievers he was looking to prove it by Believers and he already spoke these words he says well she's she's just asleep so he goes down to the house brother Mark and you know when Jesus got in there the Bible says when that they said don't worry about it don't come but he walked in anyway wish I had time to dramatize it but he came in the house and oh Mom and daddy gather then all their friends and stuff's gathered around cuz she was in her in in this sick place and he said don't worry he said she's not dead she's just asleep the Bible says they got to laughing and making fun of him and scorning him why because they were a bunch of unbelievers you know what Jesus done that Mark he said he told him to take all those unbelievers and kick them out of the house Jarvis I don't know who these people are but they're a bunch of unbelievers that ain't got no place here said notice what he was showing us it didn't matter it didn't matter what had happened he had already spoke it didn't matter what took place he already said he was coming by see and if Jesus has a promised appointment to your house there's a reason he's coming by he he ain't just coming by to poke at you or make fun of you and say well that's what you get for acting that way that that's that that's what you're going it wasn't like that he made a promise to come by and when he comes by he's coming by to restore he spoke it now he had to prove it the man said see he knew she was asleep he knew he knew that he knew the father would come because here he was a believer he said he knew this little girl she was a Jewish maid she was only asleep because the righteous do not die and he knew by the word that she was just asleep he proves his promise by the believer he came to redeem the righteous redeem means to bring back from where you once was and how could he he couldn't redeem unbelievers because they weren't redeemable they had to go to their destination and that room full of unbelievers begin to laugh Jesus just kicked them out you know what he showed us that the unbeliever would never be a witness of the Resurrection he kicked him out he took him out of the scene brother Mark and that the only ones that would be a witness of it would be the Believers that remained in the house that one day they' see a resurrection and they'd be a part of it because they were Believers and God proves his promise by Believers but say Christ is his word and you're a part of his word and that's the reason you are here is to confirm your place in life you're not confirming your place in death you're confirming your place in life confirm in our place as a Believer and you'll witness the very things that an unbeliever never will glory to God I wish I had another hour you'll witness things an unbeliever will never never be able to witness brother Mark he said why because God's word is confirmed by the believer that same God brother Mark he was the one but that by forn knowledge when he went down to lazarus's grave and called him out of the Grave he knew he wasn't dead that he was only asleep and he knew that little girl wasn't dead that she was only asleep he said why because she belonged to God she was a Believer she was a daughter of God he said and when our work on Earth is over if we don't live till it's coming we cannot die we're only asleep he proved it here and he'll prove it again well somebody stand to their feet tonight how's he going to prove it he'll prove it by Believers he said he'll do the same thing cuz he'll do the same yesterday today and forever and he'll do the same thing someday to every True Believer for his word promised that he would all of those that are in Christ God will bring with him you realize what he was quoting Thessalonians the fourth chapter Paul said but I would not have you ignorant Brethren concerning them which are asleep that you sorrow not as others that have no hope but we believe that Jesus died and rose again even so them that also which sleep in Jesus will God bring with him you say where is he going to bring them he's bringing them to the greatest meeting that this world has ever seen he's bringing them to a meeting in the air to meet those that are alive and remain Paul said for this I say by the word of the Lord that they which are alive and remain unto the coming of the Lord shall not prevent them that are asleep but the Lord shall descend from heaven with a shout and the voice of an archangel and with the Trump of God and the dead in Christ shall rise first and then we which are alive and remain shall be caught up together with them in the clouds to meet the Lord in the air and so shall we ever be with the Lord I will restore sayeth the Lord there ain't nothing that's dead that remains dead it may be dead in your mind but here the Lord says they can't even be dead if they belong to God they can't even you can no more die than God can die there are sleep just like they was laying in their bed in just for a few hours in a few days brother Mar you'll meet them in the air and they'll get up out and they old grave that you keep going to and your mouth it'll be cleared up again brother Mark to have the greatest reunion that you've ever had that's a promise of God that's thus sayith the Lord that's God's word it's a promise of God you'll meet them in the air they ain't dead they're still alive gathered in this meeting tonight to have a reunion with the with the Saints of almighty God I thank God that the angels of heaven have taken their position I say Let the church take her position tonight that God can have his way in the house of God it's a solemn assembly to restore life to the church it's a solemn assembly to to bring a union between God's children a solemn assembly God has called us together what a great hour that we live in the Travis what a great hour that he would call us to this place to give life maybe you need that life maybe you've been a little backslid you know sometimes I've been pastoring for over five years now sometimes you just had to call in an evangelist sometimes you just let the Lord let the Lord just work brother Mark just evangelize a little bit speak to our hearts bring us listen what's he doing God wants us to have life he wants the church to be alive it a he wants you to have life again he wants you to be in Revival this is God's word this ain't I didn't make this up this is a prophet of God speaking God wants us to be in that he sent the Revival of the Bride of Jesus Christ and it was to last until the Rapture of the church it ain't supposed to go out it ain't don't let the devil convince you of that that this is something for days gone by be alive the Bible said to them that are alive and remain that something so that means that some of those that have remained are living I thank God that I'm not just remaining but I'm alive and remaining brother Mark we're not walking around bunch of dead church but we're alive maybe some of you if you don't bow your heads tonight maybe some of you say brother Matt this is let me just ask you a solemn assembly be sincere before the Lord Lord I need a Revival strike my heart you know what we do sometimes we say well Lord I'll I'll plan next week and we'll plan a little bit of time and we'll try to we'll try to get everything back going and get everything but you know that ain't what God does God works on God's time sometimes when you least expect it you come to church tonight you didn't didn't

wasn't that something to see God's Mighty creation we stood out everybody out in the field and it was just something to me how that after a little while and it finally you know I me me and Sarah went on a trip just shortly after everybody on all the planes it took us hours to get to the airport everybody on all the planes were solar eclip shirts everybody just came from watching it and I they were all talking about it on the flight and everybody was sharing their photos back and forth up and down the seats of different ones that had photos and well we got out we got out to on our on our trip and we got over there and landed and got settled in of course we were still a little bit excited about and people said where where y'all from where'd y'all come from when we were over in Arkansas and now we just seen the the eclipse and and the first guy I talked to he said yeah he said I seen it looks like most of them that we saw he said I think we had about a 90 a 90% or something here he said they they all look the same to me I thought he didn't see what I saw see 90 wasn't the same 98 wasn't the same 99 wasn't the same and nowhere over there could we tell them so you know what I did Brother Jared I pulled up my phone and took pictures of it I said here's what it looked like where I was where I was my they just ad it well that ain't what we saw I no it was something different and I thought you know isn't it something we were sitting there watching that and that that that Moon finally had got into its place and there was no light you know just how you know how it kind of went dim and dark and I thought it was just so after just a moment when there was just a pen a pen of light if you still had the glasses on it looked like the moon was still in full control you remember how it went from dark and brother Morgan all of a sudden it was just like out of nowhere came this great lie this great cutting torch of a lie that just shined in there it brought brightness back to the Earth and if you look back through the glasses it was 0 point nothing per of the of the Moon that had moved and it had such a great light I thought isn't it something that it that's all it took 99.9% of it was out but it was still enough light to light the whole earth I thought that's the way it was in this age when a prophet of God said he saw he remember he was drawing the sign as the moon when he saw the vision he said when I got down to the last agage it was nothing nothing but total darkness it was the age of Bleak Darkness he said but the angel of the Lord told me you draw a little bit of light in there he said I red up there and I drew a tiny bit of the light I thought my is this something it didn't take a whole lot of Li but just the finger of a prophet of God to draw enough life that would light the whole age I thank God that we're alive tonight I thank of God that we have a light that's shining I thank God that we have a message that go tell the world that he's alive and well he's resurrected the light of God is shining again my he drove out all darkness and brought light into my life my I feel like praising the Lord you love the Lord but David could you come and

her testimony you know that scripture of what she said brother R's told that many times of people that would come through a prayer line that would have a sickness and something that they were going through that when you'd go back that the symptom would get worse she said when I went back it got bigger it grew isn't that something said but the symptom will get worse but you don't hold don't look at the symptom that's why I said don't ever look at your feelings don't look at the symptoms you look at the promise of God and God said you're healed then you claim your healing and you go forward it don't mean don't it don't just go for healing it goes for anything that you're going through you've been praying for family problems and troubles that's going on in your home you may have went home and it seemed like all out war broke loose after it happened but friends you you just wait and let the word of the Lord you just let God do his work it may seem like it's worse but you let God do his work it'll get worse before it gets better but you just watch in a few days that mountain will be beneath you and it'll be a testimony I believe that tonight amen I think we have a right to tonight
