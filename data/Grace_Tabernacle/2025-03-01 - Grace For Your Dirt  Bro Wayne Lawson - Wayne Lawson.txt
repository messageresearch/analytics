man of God Amen if you wouldn't here uh you would be blessed to go back and listen to that one amen amen so it's a it's a great honor amen um so we just want to take a few minutes tonight amen just before we open the word maybe we just bow our hearts amen and and just speak to him father we bow our hearts tonight knowing Lord that you are a merciful god we know your nature your character you've been revealed to us in this age Lord and Lord we're so thankful for the person that you turned Lord the grace that you have given the mercy you have shown and Lord as we come in here tonight we bow our hearts before you in this congregation knowing Lord that we looked at the very ground the very dust we come from Lord and and we're reminded Lord of Lord that's just what we are and who we are and Lord we realize that there's not one thing that we could do to help your children or not one good thing that we could say but Lord if you would come and take what you have put in US Lord you could speak something tonight your great spirit could come and get behind it Lord and lives could be forever changed and we ask you tonight that your mercy and your anointing would take over Lord that you would heal the sick as Among Us that you would save Lord if there be any loss may you show yourself alive to them oh God and Father we ask you that great Mercy would be given in this building Lord now father we commit this meeting into thy faithful hands in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ we pray amen and amen and God bless you tonight if you have your Bibles I would like to look into the word here if we could in 1 John chapter 3 and verse 8 1 John 3 and verse eight I'm a little basy in this thing if you can adjust them 1 John 3 in verse eight amen um I'd like to look in verse eight and also verse n amen it's so it's such an honor to have so many men of God here with us tonight I'm just looking across the congregation trying to see all these preachers and I said my goodness what am I doing up here amen I make a better amener than a preacher amen but amen but I I certainly do appreciate each of you that it could be here tonight amen 1 John chapter 3 and verse 8 and verse 9 now he that committs sin is of the devil for the devil sinth from the beginning and for this purpose the Son of God was manifested that he might be able to destroy the works of the devil now whosoever is born of God doeth not commit sin for his seed remaineth in him and he cannot sin because he is born of God Amen you may be seated tonight we want to thank you amen if you can give me a little more in my Monitor and I'll adjust it from here amen uh we just want to look at this amen for a few minutes tonight and I want to talk to you about Grace for your dirt Grace for your dirt amen uh I I I look tonight to realize uh that a prophet has been Among Us and has said some very powerful things and amen and I want to just tell you up front I'm a message preacher so amen you forgive me for preaching what I believe but amen I'm not comfortable anywhere else so I just go ahead and speak from my heart and uh you know the prophet of God said this amen he said I've seen squirrels appear six different times and he says just see he can create squirrels the same as he can create flies or frogs or anything else he's God he's a Creator and no mortal being but then When sin of a mortal is confessed and dropped into the Clorox bleach of Jesus Christ it bleaches all the sin he's purely unadulterated without sin and without fault and he that is born of God doeth not commit sin he cannot sin for the bleach stands between him and God and how could it ever get there when it breaks up and sends it right back to the one who perverted it oh he said I feel religious I tell you I get stimulation he said to know as this begins this revival in the first seal he said he that is born of God do not commit sin for he cannot sin how can you make him a sinner when the bleach of the blood of Jesus Christ is between him and God now that would scatter sin till there would be nothing left of it how can that pure blood of Christ ever let sin pass through there it cannot and John 1 and verse2 John says but as many as received him to them he gave power power to become the sons of God even to them that believe on his name which were born not of blood nor of the will of Flesh nor of the will of man but of God Amen isn't that amazing beautiful tonight to know amen that you are born of God not of man not of Flesh not of the will of man but of God brother man I'm going to say something beautiful about this he said now listen I want you to know your adoption is not your birth your adoption is your placing and you're born again see you're predestin you're born again of the spirit of God we are the sons of God but we are predestinated now here's what I'm trying to get to you for the sons of this last day we're predestinated unto adoption now we are here we are now this is what hurts the Pentecostals a little they say I got born again praise the Lord I got the Holy Ghost he said now that's fine you're a child of God that's right but that ain't what I'm talking about see we're predestin unto adoption and adoption is your placing amen now we find out tonight we're born of the will of God Amen but you know there's a furtherment of the experience of children of God besides birth ain't you glad that God had more for us as children when we were born we were born but we had to move on into something amen and and you know here in the signs of his coming 62 brother man says if the it's the word of the Lord he said that it's Prem it's pre premeditated thought now that's how we have eternal life because we are spoken into existence by God well hallelujah amen here's here's a real word Prophet we've been spoken into existence by God we didn't join into a church we are born by the word see the Original Seed God said let there be and there was and that's the way God borns his children today in the womb of their heart is with his word and his word takes root and then begins to grow now how can the spirit in the human heart say it's of God and then deny the word amen I tell you this I believe this in in wisdom versus faith brother B say it again now if you're a born again child of God you are and you got the holy spirit in you you are the manifestation of God's spoken word before it was a word it has to be a thought before it can be a word and a word is a spoken thought now thoughts was in God and when you were in eternity when when we were in God in eternity and we were spoken into existence by his word amen I tell you what amen you start looking at some of these things and begin to realize amen spoken into existence by his word amen children of God not just children of man but born of the will of God Amen Let me let me just make it in the true Easter seal or true true Easter seal brother R says it very powerfully he says listen uh there's a tree of death which was your mother and she brought you into n natural life he said but Christ's birth through spiritual life see now if you live by a woman you die he said but all that's born of a man lives and all that comes by the woman is natural and all that comes from man is spiritual not the man here but the man Christ Jesus see when you were born of your mother you were born into death but when you were born of the word Christ Jesus then you were born into life amen I believe it today I believe God is bringing spiritual children into this age that we're living in by his word there are children being borned amen borned into life amen indivisible Union brother BR makes it real explanatory here and begins to tell you what kind of children you are he says listen another thing I want you to notice amen what kind of children she is bearing he said listen this will tell you what your papa is whether it's a first ey or the second Adam you believe both has children don't they and there's a first Adam and a second Adam but if the church brings forth a child of the second Adam he acts like the second way of second Adam's way of acting I love how the prophet says it he said the second Adam's way of acting yall know what that is don't you how does the second Adam's children act he said just like they did on the day of Pentecost that's right just like they did on the day of Pentecost amen you said well I don't know which Adam I'm born of well how'd you get your birth was it just a church joining was it just an agreement to somebody's Doctrine or did you get born to the word of God that it that gave you an ignition in your soul and experience with a living God I'll tell you this invisible Union he'll say a true picture of the modern church today she don't this this neither does this modern church one of these here screaming shouting tongue speaking acts 238 Young running around here see she don't want them whooping and crying and screaming and amen and Hallelujah why such a child would immediately put her out of her denomination they had one like that and do to their churches why they' throw her out right quick amen why you let stuff like that go on he here's a prophet telling you if you're a part of denomination brother Matt here's what they'd say why you let this kind of stuff go on in your church amen but a prophet of God said see amen but they're pregnated with something amen the churches are growing in the world they're pregnated with something he said because they're bringing forth members all the time but she don't want none of them screaming hollering blabbering acts 238 miserable creatures she thinks they are why it would certainly embarrass her it would ruin her her educated ethical scientific Society Church she belongs to well they would throw her out at the next Council she can't have it so she don't want to be pregnated with the word because that's the only only kind this word can bring forth right Born of the spirit of God it has the spirit of God in it no intellectual Church joining Creed joining bobbed haired painted face there's no such a thing in all of that you can't find that in the word of God but you can find an oldfashioned Holy Ghost Field child born of the spirit of God screaming hollering shouting and praising God I pray it never goes out of style I pray the oldfashioned Holy Ghost meetings never leave us friends I pray there's an atmosphere if there's a person in here tonight I pray there's such an atmosphere that they can find the birth in the middle of this church tonight amen I believe tonight I believe that people can be born again under the atmosphere of God y'all believe that brother brand said you let John do come in and get in the right atmosphere and if he ever gets under it he'll know just as sure as there's a God he'll get an experience because he gets in the right atmosphere I'll tell you this this is how we are to bring forth members it ought to be another act too and if we brought forth members like that you can put all the pressure you want on them but they're built to handle the pressure come on they're not going to fold under Le oia because they're built to handle the pressure I'm afraid that's what's going on we got too many hot house plants amen too many chickens amen it ain't never been amen the mate ain't never been in the house with them yall say preacher amen I don't know about Doctrine well I'll tell you let's make it simple you got some chickens amen if you got to let a mate the maale bird get in there before you can have little chickens and too many times we locked out the male bird we got the church but what we need is the mail part amen we need Christ to come in the church and to ignite it to bring little ones right on but if God ever brings a little one in the church they'll have to be born the same way they were in the book of Acts they'll have to be born the same way hallelujah praise be to God I believe that's how he brings his members is acts the second chapter somebody said well brother Wayne Mary just believe the word be it unto me according to Thy word I mean and that's the scripture but that's not her Birth come on do I've seen I've seen doctors of divinities with their Baptist theology try to make it that that was Mary just just believe just according to the word that's way but that's not even what that's talking about come on when she got born again how many knows where she got her new birth brother BR said if God made Mary go in that upper room he said and get drunk in the spirit and talk in tongues he'll never let us in heaven without it amen don't you try to get into heaven without an acts 238 experience with almighty God I believe it's going to take it church I believe you got to be born again by the baptism of the Holy Ghost in the power of God Mary believe that's right but it requires contact with God it requires an encounter with God I believe it I believe we got some man-made bars in the last days like that brother B saw that eagle in that cage he said I'd give every dollar I got to get her out there and I'll tell you this I believe he was seeing more than an old Eagle in the cage I think he was looking at children of God Eagles that were in the cages of man and their misunderstanding and the barring in of the church God never made you an eagle to be barred in to the understanding of man he made you to fly he made you to get up there in the sky and feel the power of God that's where you get your meat when you get up high that's where you can see that Revelation come on that Hulk gets blind and lazy but the eagle Can Fly Fast and Swift and he can catch the revelation of his age and feed on the modern events made clear by prophecy which gives him strength and vision amen I I know y' hey brother Wayne what's wrong with you amen I tell you this I I I I just I I've come to a place where I realize that some of the churches are getting a bit like they are down in Florida you know those those mature communities but they got signs where they say mature communities you know in other words don't you bring in a bunch of Bratz over here in my swimming pool they got they got the condos but you can't get one of them Jared you got too many young on running around there they want a mature Community where there ain't no dancing no shouting no running amen but I tell you why amen I believe believe God's still bringing youngers I believe he's still bringing children of God in this age and I pray that the bursts keep happening that the power of God keeps moving in the church I experience and the power of God man I'm not interested in your material communities I want where the life of God is bringing birth all the time I know I got five grandkids now I got one Lord just miraculously gave it all of them Miracles but the Lord just miraculously gave Eevee to us and she tells us now and again Papa me a miracle mom made her set in the corner and she said me a miracle mama she said but you're still in trouble so just cuz you're a miracle don't mean you can't get a little correction yeah that's right she told me the other day she got this little cousin he's about four he might be five but now they call him Coco and he says Pao she said Coco don't believe me an angel baby I said well sure you're paa's angel baby ain't you but you know what it ain't nothing to get up and and walk across our floor about middle of the day and they'd be a toy here and a toy there and a toy here you know what that is don't you that's a sign of life around the house that's a sign of Miracles that have have been manifested in our midst sure amen they're infant now but they're growing they're growing amen and I I I tell you what see as long as you're getting in the spirit of God there's going to be manifestations of that Spirit happening all around you I like how brother random says it he says in Pat's Vision he said oh John was in the spirit on the Lord's day he said that's right now remember he says the first thing you have to do is get in the spirit amen that's right the first thing you have to do is get in the spirit he said now can you imagine somebody going down to a dance he said you start dancing Clapping Your Hands patting your feet down this Shin dig and throwing your hat on the floor and going around and around acting silly and you was in the spirit of can you imagine a fella sitting over there and he said well I guess it's a pretty good time he said oh you a Wallflower he meant then he changes he said go down that ball game he said somebody knocks a home run he said see him look over there he said well I guess that's pretty good y'all heard brother Ram say it on tape but you well I guess that's pretty good he said you ain't no baseball F he said then we come down to the church you get in the spirit raise up holler Glory Hallelujah praise the Lord somebody turn around and say Holy Roller Amen brother BR said I'd rather be a Holy Roller as an Unholy roller amen I'd rather be a Holy Roller as an Unholy roller see he was in the spirit and brother man said it's when you get in the spirit things begin to take place that's when it is and then somebody said to me here while back said I think when John got in the spirit spirit and and they was explaining what they thought and it was funny cuz the next day I was reading what brother BR said he said oh John was up there he said dancing and a jumping and a running all around that Island he went he was having a good old time he was in the spirit he said now that may sound sacrilegious and I don't mean it to he says but listen well that's what he might have been doing I believe he was having a good time in the spirit praising God because that's exactly what happened when the spirit fell the first time and when the Holy Ghost fell on them they staggered like drunk men and women and acted like they were drunk and jaborn and carrying on these people are full of new wine that's the way they acted the first time so the spirit of God comes on them again he probably acted that same way there's nothing new about this friends this is an oldtime religion if you don't think it's old go back to the Book of Job it said before the foundations of the world had job saw the sons and daughters uh the sons of God shouting with joy that's right amen amen I I know I I don't want to just stay here but I want to just show you a couple of these quotes as I'm moving now watch's the prophet of God talk about this he talks about dancing in the spirit I always thought it was amazing because he talks about Jehosaphat and he talks about out there when Jehoshaphat was out there with Ahab remember and they they kind of got out there in that trouble and and they wanted to get out of the desert they want to get out of the trouble and somebody said go get Elijah he poured the hand water on the hands of Elijah and brother said when Elisha got up there he was upset and he said if it wasn't for this man of God I wouldn't even talk to you people that's right and he he said all of a sudden they said bring a Minstrel and they got over there and he said they got to play in that Minstrel he said the next thing you know he said the prophet got in the spirit he said oh there it is they begin to play that music he said Oh my he said if it you you can't be the prophet be said but maybe you didn't play the instrument you know they play that music and begin to bring the spirit down on that Prophet they begin to play the tambourine and beat the drums and oh my okay they me to beat the drums and play the instruments and all them begin to beat and play had great old songs playing he said they were singing going to be a meeting in the air in that sweet sweet by and by my brother randam sure like that one didn't he he said oh the prophet began to get in the spirit the face thinging you know he be to happen he said that's what's a matter we can't get any words cuz we don't want get in the spirit of it he watch what he says the spirit got on that prophet he begin to see things see you begin to see things when you get in the spirit when you get in the spirit all you might dance a little oh you might shout a little but the most important part of that is you get outside of your Pride and Prejudice and your carnal realm where you can see Revelation and you can see the things of God oh I tell you this amen I wonder why brother Bram knew what got Elisha in a good mood I wonder how he knew that except Spirit Elijah was on him and he was sitting in a meeting one day and they got to singing there's going to be a meeting in the air and he said an old girl got to play it on the tambourine other one I think they was beating a pan he said they got to dancing in my church he said no church manners at all he was a Baptist preacher before he started walking in the open or the fullness of the word sure he was amen and to him that was just off of hand what's a matter no training at all to do that in a church amen but it was more than a Baptist preacher he was a prophet and he said he be to think about dancing in the Bible and begin to run it in the scripture and found out it meant Victory amen and then all of a sudden a prophet cleared dancing by the word and the next thing you know he was out there dancing with him amen and that Prophet was dancing to the same song He said Elisha was enjoying out there on the mountain now what are we talking about we're talking about getting in the spirit because man is a spirit do you know that man is a spirit and God is a spirit and he makes the spirit of man now you were created in God's image so when you get in the spirit you're getting into a realm of the unlimited I know I know for a fact I've seen it I've seen the Holy Ghost move down in assemblies and I've seen him move powerful upon them hearts and lives amen I've seen people walk in the church one thing and leave another I've seen them packing in spirits of unclean things and when the anointing begins to move it breaks the Yoke off of them and they leave free and full of the Holy Ghost listen if it works for them then it'll work for us tonight the anointing still breaks the yoke upon the children of God you know what I'm telling you is the truth you've crawled into church and shouted your way back out the back door you have come into church and thought I don't know if I'm going to make it in the back door but when the preaching began and the spirit began to move the Holy Ghost Begin to Fall my goodness you said what's going on brother B said it's the casting out of demons what's going on the anointing the ministry is backing those spirits up so you can get into the presence of God in the spirit you are unlimited listen as long as you stay in this realm of dirt you ain't nothing but dirt but if you get into the realm of the spirit you are an unlimited vessel you can do anything there is nothing that's not possible with the Church of the Living God that stops off into the spirit realm amen I believe that I believe Sons and Daughters of God are born to the spirit of God and God is a spirit sir he said brother Wayne I got the Holy Ghost what's that make me brother bam said the baptism of the holy spirit is to be made deity itself himself amen he said now that didn't set very good he said but a man or woman that's born to the spirit of God has got a part of God and you're Sons and Daughters of God and Jesus said it was written in the scripture that you are Gods John chap 10:34 I'll read it for you Jesus answered and said is it not written I said ye are Gods that's right and if he called them Gods unto whom the word of God came to the scripture cannot be broken oh brother Wayne but that was for way back there I love how the prophet says it Jesus is saying 1957 he said see read John 10 down to the 30th verse and I want you to listen close to the reading and then apply that reading to right now this very hour then you'll be straight on the word if you leave that back there you're missing the word but if you bring that up here then you're going to be straight on the word of course he's quoting Psalms 82 I have said ye are gods and all of you are the children of the most high that's right see testimony of a true witness oh God what is it it's the Holy Ghost see the true witness of God what is it it is deity tabernacled in man Hallelujah preacher what are you talking about let's continue on it's God living in a man deity God himself tabernacled into the person when he can speak and it's the same as God speaking that's the Church of Jesus Christ that's that's the way the Apostolic Church went out at the first what did they hear as my father sent me so send I you what happened when they went the father went in them and when God sent you to this earth he came in you he didn't just send you by yourself but it is rich in a little while and the world seeth me no more but you shall see me I will be with you even in You Until the End of the Age then the very creator of Heaven and Earth is in this building tonight in the form of Sons and Daughters of [Music] God oh it's so easy to believe that about Paul Peter James John it's so easy to glorify their lives and to make them Angelic and sinless and no Faults and no mistakes that's the devil dealing with your mind to make you think that way about them saints of old they were made out of the dirt just like you're made out of dirt let me ask y'all something is dirt dirt or is dirt dirt come on y'all he billies dirt is dirt I don't care if it's Texas dirt Louisiana Dirt Ohio dirt Canada dirt African dirt dirt is dirt and whether we want to acknowledge it or not Peter was dirt and Paul was dirt and James was dirt Jesus was dirt oh I know that tears that Pentecostal up don't it I you know people people don't even think Jesus could have had a family they really don't they don't even think he ever had any struggles of of Temptations or burning passions or no they they don't think he had any of that but my Bible said he come lower than the angels and took upon himself the Seed of Abraham that he might feel the Temptation and be tempted in every light manner that you're tempted I know he was a Son of God but he was put into Mary to have a dirt body you know where he got his body out of the calcium and the potach and out of the vegetables she ate and out of the food she took in her body formed a dirt body but in that dirt body was a created Son of God hallelujah I know I know but it was dirt then and it's dirt now but for some reason you think if it's old dirt it's better dirt still dirt They Carried the word across dirt a lot of times you remember David when he took the when he took the ark one of brother bram's sermons he talks about the Victory and David dancing before the Ark of the Lord y'all know what they done to carry that word over that dirt they killed oxen ever six steps they wouldn't take six steps without killing something amen because the blood was coming on the ground I thought we get bent and and I love worshiping dancing and I worship and shouting but that was also worship and killing and sometimes you got to kill something before you can feel the Liberty to dance a little bit and David was killing stuff and he was worshiping God but blood was getting on the ground I tell you today we need the blood we need the blood on this dirt that we might have Liberty and victory to serve God like we've never served God before you know where that word was going it was going to the Tabernacle that Tabernacle was a tent it was just a tent but it was a three-phase which represented a human body and showed you the ox and blood was only the blood of Jesus that would sanctify this dirt that would that would sanctify the process that the Ark of the Covenant would be moved from the Tabernacles of levitical law into the heart of man so that we would house God in dirt dirty dirt now folks I read this message all the time and I heard brother bam say I'd like to go in and pray for this little boy he said I was waiting for a vision brother B said the angel of the Lord pulled me back and said he's wait and see what you're going to do that's right and brother B said see when I go in to pray for that child the same dirty hands that's the same dirty hands will lay on that child whether I have a vision or I just do it by the word do you see hey man let me just say it real clearly there is nothing impossible with God but God said there's nothing impossible with you that believe not with God but with you because deity is in man the very God that stood back here on a mystical platform of the eternities rolled the words off of his hands and created these things give you the privilege to be sons and you're a part of him and God dwells in mankind and man himself is deity Hallelujah there you are might choke you a little but study it a while Hallelujah God is in the dirt God picked up the dust and put his own spirit in it let me tell you something about God he's a mighty conquerer and it don't matter what he's in he's still God God is not the kind of thing that you can put him in something and it can tame him down or weaken him I know I know there might be certain products you know come on you might you might put something in a certain bag and cover the sin or take away or weaken down but you can put God in anything and he remains to be the same God you can't weaken him or take his power God dwells in mankind that's right that great wonderful church will go forth with power and deity because deity will be revealed in human beings by the Holy Spirit bringing to pass yes sir the thought of your mind can you imagine that the sons of God in the last day was so take on the mind of Christ that when they're meditating God will bring to pass the very thing they're thinking about oh I know it sounds impossible but With God all things are possible that's what he told Mary wasn't it With God all things are possible you know what that really means not has never spoke a word he don't have the power to perform whatever he spoke he has the power to manifest that word deity see it's speaking perg Church age brother says the word comes into you he said if that Holy Spirit is in there and it's alive as soon as it comes in the very promise is true nothing therefore if you say to the mountain you know the scripture if you say to the mountain don't doubt in your heart because what you are are is deity speaking now you believe that because the Bible said so whatever you said shall come to pass if you'll not doubt it see if you can get all the world breed out of you amen if you get all the hbri out of you get all of that bread out of you he said then let that Holy Spirit make you a full son or daughter of God no world no condemnation no doubt what is it it's more than you then it's God in you then you take this word it's a promise and say father it's your promise Satan's got to move it's got to move because it's children of God now I know I know in this last day there's all kinds of uh falsehoods around this uh the speaking the word cuz they're going to name it and claim it you get all kinds of of jealousy and and and self motivation and you know it it it it it gets more clear all the time amen that power without character is certainly demonic but Power with character is fit to rule is that right that's why God was working on your character but working on your character don't forget who you are he deals with us as Sons that's right people people forget these scriptures and I and I recognize John 14:12 there was a whole group one time that made that he that believeth and the works that I do shall great they said he is brother Bram they he that believeth they just make it one and they make it brother brandom well there's a lot of scripture says he that believeth starts in John 5:24 he that believeth on me amen you you see you can't just start identifying that it's just belonging to one man but unto all of the children of Abraham are these promises made we are joint air with Christ in every one of these so then somebody says to me and it's a it's it's a valid question brother Wayne will everybody speak swirls will everybody speak like this listen let me say this it would be carnal impersonation on your behalf to try to impersonate a prophet but there is a potential with inside of you that if a man had a need the devil said if you be the Son of God cast yourself down make these stones into bread if you're hungry remember that amen but Jesus never said he couldn't that's right and later he fed 5,000 I wonder if the devil was watching that day you see in John brother bam says it like this and I love the sermon in spiritual Amnesia he ties together Mark 11 and John 1412 and he said can you be identified there to believe that's the truth if it hasn't then you're getting spiritual Amnesia and you have forgot see you lose your Christian balance you can't tell where you're belong you said well I'm a Methodist or I'm Baptist he said see he's that's what I know about it I'm a Pentecostal see watch out that means that that disease sign is showing on you you got spiritual Amnesia as a Believer you have a right to those scriptures if you can just remember you're a Son of God how many was here last night wasn't that powerful amen after you remember that God deals with you as a child as a son then you can strengthen your knees and lift up your hands I believe you ought to remember who you are you ought to remember the sons of God as a right to speak the word of God you ought to remember you have a right to have dominion over the devil you ought to remember your right as a son or daughter of God I believe you ought to remember your rights that's right remember your rights and I think sometimes you need to remember your past the right way cuz I know Satan's always trying to remember a past but the past he wants you to remember is one that destroys you why is that as far back as Satan's memory goes seems like he can't get back to Calvary seems like his memory's not long enough he's got shortterm memory he wants to talk to you about 30 years or 40 years ago but I'd like to talk to him about 2,000 years ago Satan if you like a debate come on up and we'll talk a little we'll talk a little devil gets on you wants to come to church with you I tell you what you ought to do sometimes you ought to shout that devil off you ought to dance you ought to say devil if you're going to stay on me hang on cuz we're going to Worship the Lord a little while and that devil will get off of you pretty quick that's right you ought to remember amen I know I know this one thing I you and the devil say well you wasn't there and I wasn't there before the foundation of the world either in my memory but in God's memory I was there because he said I always was a son right come on Church said well you can't say that if you can't remember that how many of y'all remember the day you're born now how many of y'all remember you were 6B and 12 O on May the 12th of 1942 or amen you come on no but nobody remembers the moment of their birth sir but your mama told you about it and you traded your memory for her memory and you tell it like it's the truth but you don't no more remember that than nothing but you take it for the truth and it becomes your memory but I tell you this word is my memory I'm remembered the way God said it was and the beautiful thing is it's not just a memory of my past I'm going to remember my future I'm going to remember there's a millennium coming I'm going to remember there's a future home coming and the best of all Jared I'm going to remember as a day we're going to throw that devil in the Lake of Fire and he's never going to harm another son or another daughter again Hallelujah I'm going to be first brother Donnie I'm going to stand first in line to kill that old nervous devil that old anxiety devil I'm going to kick that thing right off in the fire and maybe do a little dig amen and say to him devil amen we fought a long time but I knew your day was coming sometimes you got to remember your future said well how do you remember your future you trade your memory for his memory because the same God that knew what was what is also knows what's going to be yes sir I remember my future yes sir now beloved we are the sons of God it don't yet appear what we shall be but we know that when he shall appear we shall be like him but we shall see him as he is that's right now y'all all know that of course is talking of the change of the body and the offering glorified body but it also speaks with the appearing of the Lord in this age to manifest what a true son should be amen what is it it's Christ would manifest to destroy the works of the devil we are now Sons and Daughters of God not off in the future no not sometime in the future we set in Heavenly places right now we're right now sons and let me tell you this the only argument you got about that is you're trying to think about angels on that's right and some preachers have got right on board with the devil and they're trying to tell everybody you can't be a son till you're an angel well let me give you good news you're never going to be an angel even when you have a glorified body you're not going to be an angel but why would you want to be an angel when you're a Son of God Amen listen an angel can't even go in the presence of God without covering their face but you and I even as a sinner can come under the blood of Jesus Christ and walk boldly into the throne of grace in the time of [Applause] need I tell you this amen I believe this I don't believe in this sinless Perfection folks are trying to preach in this last day I got well we going to preach anyhow I got young people coming to altars that got the Holy Ghost two camps ago and still trying to get the Holy Ghost cuz somebody's made them believe if you ever get the Holy Ghost you're perfect no more Temptation no more Struggle No More trial no you're talking about angels but as a Son of God Amen here's a prophet telling us he went through depression he went through Temptations He went through struggles he went through trials because he was just dirt I'll tell you what we're sinless I know you are and a glorified body is coming someday but whether you like it or not right now you're in a terrestrial body and if you look it up Paul called it a body of humiliation this is where you're being humiliated listen you young guys don't understand hang on few years you'll catch up it's when you're being humiliated yeah come on some brother way what are you talking about let me just let me just say it out clear the effectual fervent prayer of a righteous man availeth much the effectual fervent prayer of a righteous man brother B said a righteous man is a man who confesses his sins that's a righteous one not sinless yes sir way what are you talking about but the time we get done if you really personally knew brother brandom you might not let him be a son hey can can we just get it out there we have so glorified brother Ram's error that you probably don't even think there was one sick person in his church I'm not rebuking you I'm opening up a door to let you understand something have you ever thought that the man who had a Divine Divine Healing Miracle gift yeah sent into the age to restore Divine Healing had sick people in his church and don't you think the devil run around saying it ain't true because that person's sick or this certain happened or that person died amen when I F here and read the prophet of God and he said it ain't perfect till it gets in weakness strength ain't perfect till it becomes weak and then when it becomes weak and then then you can see the strength in it that was a girl sit in brother Ram's meetings for years in a wheelchair and brother B said there she sits as happy as she could be because she found her place and brother said oh she's just as happy as she could be amen but she was in the prophet's meetings there is more scriptures in this Bible than when somebody got healed I know you like to read about Paul shaking the Viper off in the SN in the fire I do too but how about his swimming lesson from the boat over to the bank he's out there swimming with the rest of them he's just dirt he said who shall deliver me from this body of sin oh I don't find anything that can do it but one day he said oh there's a law that is working it's a law of death but I find another law it is the law of life I know y'all know the law of life amen that's why he says it very clearly not Angelic come on dirt I say unto you I say unto you now I I would love to have have the same emphasis that Jesus had when he said to them I say unto you can you imagine our lord Jesus standing next to that tree that had just withered in 24 hours and then turn and say I say unto you if you just had the faith of God you could speak under this mountain and it would be moved and and and and a world of unbelievers have said oh it's a mountain of sin brother BR said no it wasn't he said he was pointing at the mountain of of Olives amen and and because that somebody amen has come up to that mountain and didn't feel like it moved brother random helped you he said listen if you do that with Earnest heart and it's coming from inspiration it's nothing more than de he speaking and he said a sand has been removed from that mountain the very moment you spoke it I know that's Faith amen and then there's God giving a commanding faith that comes into the church I'm speaking to you church not somebody El tonight I say unto you if you say unto this mountain I know your dirt God knows your dirt he even said it he knows your flesh I say unto you little Gods Gods I being the one God without sin proved it peace be still in the tree no man can eat from it verily I say unto you you little Gods if you'll say to this mountain and be moved and don't doubt in your heart you can have what you will will say will come to pass you can have what you've said Mark 11:24 is the scripture now what is it we're living in the age of adoption adoption part four brother B will say it very clearly going back to Genesis to the original what is it the world and nature is groaning and crying everything moving up for what for the manifestation of the sons of God when true Sons born Sons filled Sons amen speak the word of God and it's backed I believe we're on the borderline of it tonight if you say under this mountain Romans the 8th chapter said the whole creation granth and travaileth until the manifestations of sons I'll tell you this is the day of the manifestation of sons when the Mysteries that's been hid from the foundation of the world is to be made known this is the hour this is the hour when sons are revealed amen it takes election for God to bring you now I know Satan would like to diminish election amen and and just set it aside you know it's just like believing this message when you when you believe this message I I know what Satan tries to lay evidences and he tries to lay evidences and he tries to put them here and put them over there and somewhere else because he's always deflecting what the real true evidence of the spirit of God is and and let me just make a a a quick answer we can read it later if you need it but let's just give the quick answer the true evidence of the spirit is that you believe the message of your day right that's the true evidence so so what Satan does is diminish the believing part and he tries to say things like well Heen everybody could believe that message see you're nothing special because you believe it but you are because you believe it now I let me just say something very clearly brother bandam says it like this amen he tells us that when Peter was standing they're talking to the Lord Jesus and he said who do you say I am he said Thou Art the son the living of God he said there it is Peter's name he said light stried across it and showed his name was on the Lamb's Book of Life this message that you are studying looking at reading listening to amen there have been many mo men that have longed to see what you are seen and have not saw it there's Kings and Priests and Prophets that have longed to see but you see it now why do you see it because there is something hidden in your dirt that's right something in your dirt made you believe now some of you guys in here are farmers and and the one thing about one thing about uh the spring in Arkansas I do like it is that you don't have snow on the ground in April you know they start planting these fields and next thing you know the sun pops up and starts moving over the field well I tell you what that sun covers every part particle of dirt out there in the field but why is it there there's one little piece of dirt out there that there's a little movement that happens when the Sun Passes over amen that Sun Shines on dirt Shines on rocks Shines on limbs amen but the place of dirt where there's a little seed hiding in there it makes it a different piece of dirt and you might just be dirt but on the inside of that dirt is a part of the Living God that is hi itself and when the son of this God begin to rise over this age something begin to awaken on the inside of you and it begin to move you what is it it's something in that dirt oh it's just dirt but there's weed in there oh it's just dirt but let me say it there's God in [Applause] there sir I I I tell you one thing I enjoy I enjoy the message of the hour in Romans the 5th chapter Paul said if you're justified by faith therefore you have peace with God how many knows that the Bible said that the Bible foreing the Heathen was saved by faith amen therefore the Heathen is saved by believing the gospel that's how the Gentiles get in the Covenant of God it's by faith in the word and it's written in Ephesians the second chapter by Grace you are saved and that is through faith so you got a whole world full of people out here amen that makes it like oh I believed it and I'm saved now let me just let me just say this the way I the way I see it sometimes people become arrogant because they can see the message now it's very important that God let you see it but pray to God that we never get arrogant in it because it wasn't you that saw it let me let me just say this you say I believed it well let me ask you this what in you believed it you got to go deeper than I believed it because there's the same that somebody said well I grew up in a message home that don't mean anything I've seen them go up in the message home and disbelieve it I've seen them goow up in the gutter and believe it go up in the gutter disbelieve it come out of mansions believe it disbelieve it Baptist Catholic every Walk of Life believe it disbelieve it because it's all dirt but the one that God laid a seed down on the inside there's something in them that believes it can I say very clearly you wasn't saved by your desire you were saved by the desire of God so before you could believe it God had Grace and let you believe the very thing that's going to save you oh it's Grace Grace nothing but the grace of God there ain't nothing you could do it was Grace that gave it to you that's why Jesus said man cometh unto me except my father first draw him that word draw does not mean that he woed you and by some great magic that's in you some great that you were better than somebody else you said God I'm going to come to you amen no no no no it's not that way at all that's the arm minist way of believing things you know what it really was the word draw actually means the word drag and no man come to me and unless I drag him you see that's what God done to you he drugg you he drugged you into the promises of God he drug you into the grace of God and after a while you begin to surrender because you was done getting [Applause] dragged I was preaching the home the other day talking to the church about fishing I know y'all's a fishing group amen but you know what brother Bram likeing third pole of fishing don't he and he said it was that third that would do it it would catch them and if you ever Hook by this message you're hooked by God and he has a reputation of being a fisherman he ain't never lost no fish he knows how to he knows how to get you yes sir he knows just how to get you we we fish for them big salmon up there sometimes in Cadillac and them things weigh sometimes 30 and 35 pounds and and there's a current in the river amen and you're fishing on a you that knows what 17 pound means it's a 17lb liter and they have a rule of how big a hook you can use just a little bitty hook on a fly with a 17 lb liter and a 35 lb salmon running with its head all it can run well me and Zach started fishing for them we we' hook up five or six we and we'd lose all of them but one and finally about second trip we made up there amen we we went up there and I said Zach it's something got to change here we got to we got to change takes us 45 minutes to hook one and five minutes to lose it we got to change something here so after a while we started hooking them and we got where we we would hook five and six and we'd catch five out of every six we got but what we did is we loosened our drag just a little bit and we quit pulling so hard we just loosened the drag and I I know y'all know the principle sometimes you need to realize that when you are fighting with God he never lost you he just loosened off the drag and you're out there running thinking you that you've got your own wheel and you got your long way but he still got a hook in you and when you get really tired when you get really tired you'll turn that old head toward the boat and he'll start reeling you in listen I tell you what one day I got tired I was sitting in a service and I got tired and he begin to drag me he tightened the drag brother and he started breing me in and let me tell you this he got me in the boat and I'm going home with him we didn't save ourselves that deposit of deity that's inside of you now now I I I just have to I just have to preach what's in my heart folks one time I told y'all the story here at Grace Tabernacle one time I was I was uh just studying how to make gold I was going to try to become a rich man it's illegal by the way but I got the reading on all that y'all know gold don't actually come from the earth it comes from the heavens yeah it comes in fallen stars it fell Stars burned out in the heaven fell into the Earth deposited gold into the Earth and then it made veins of gold in the earth which was a fallen Source from heaven but the thing about the Fallen source of the gold is it's mingled in dirt that's that's why some property you can buy for a hundred bucks and a property right beside it might be worth a million it ain't always what's on the surface it's what under the surface if there's a gold mine in that baby you ain't taking no $10 for that acre not $100 because the value is not what you're seeing it's what's down under the dirt and God put a deposit of deity in your life and said God so loved the world he so valued your dirt that he would die to redeem you not because of what you look like it's what's in the inside of you there's a son there's a daughter there's a deposit of gold down in there now I know amen some people think well the minute we dig the gold out it's finished but brother Braham taught us better than that he said when you dig that gold out you're not done he said the old days they smelted the gold and hid it in fire he said but some of them were beaders of gold and they take that gold and begin to beat it you know what they were doing they were separating the pyate and the iron and the ore and the and the minerals they were taking out of the gold so they could get pure gold the same way brother W God done me and you he took this old Lawson laid him up on his work table and began to beat him and he beat him and some of you sitting here saw me the day he dug me out of the dirt and you watched me get beat for years and you wonder why is that boy getting beat like that it's because I had to Bear an image God wasn't done with me in a birth he wanted to see his own reflection don't forget your sons and daughters of God and he's going to deal with you somebody said brother Wayne when's it done when the beater can see his reflection you thought that was the neighbor that was beating you you thought that was the wife the hus you thought that was the customer you thought that no sir it was God that won't let you stay in that stage of infancy but it's forcing you into Perfection yes sir what is it it's a time that when God has took this lovely bride and he's begin to bring her into that place now it says in the Scriptures it says in the scriptures I'll pour my spirit out upon all dirt and it would come the time of a great appearing and a great releasing to this church the things that's been hid since the world began now the thing is it Brothers I I I don't want you to think I'm crazy but the sunship does not begin in the Millennium sunship is here there is to be a manifestation of sunship before the Rapture do you see God predestinated the church further than the birth further than the baptism so brother Wayne how could she go further now now I'm I'm an old hillbilly and y'all got to forgive me y'all all know that y'all y'all watch me grow up some of you watch me get the Holy Ghost thank God he wasn't done with me there cuz tonight I got the holy ghost at the altar now now oh my Uncle Tom sitting right there he was there at night Uncle Tom you can be a witness I didn't know if Matthew was in the Old Testament or new did I thank God that wasn't the finish of of that that thank God God didn't say to me that's it boy but he had something further it's his word the birth makes you a son this word makes you an adopted son Let's just say it the message places you the Baptist can't place you the Lutheran can't place you they don't know where you go but here's a prophet with the mind of God setting the order of the church now I'll make it simple for you amen there's three steps right here isn't there and brother BR said that woman in them high heels walked up all three but when it come to walking that word she said I can wear these high heels if I want to and she come up all three steps wearing it but when it comes to the place Eve fell she fell the same place and the Pentecostals fell right where Eve fell they fell on the word but there's a bride that is predestinated in this age that will never fail she will never fail because she is the word she's not trying to walk the word she is the [Applause] word all hell can't stop it she's predestinated unto the adoption all hell won't stop this that's right brother B says and all hell won't stop it you're predestinated to it you could stop the sun quicker that's right that's right how many you ever read the story when Jesus he got in the boat with his disciples he said get in he said we're going to go to the other side y'all know what was over there Legion was going to get delivered wasn't he and when Jesus got in there brother bam tells the story he said there got a devil got on every wave and while the Believers had Jesus rest in the boat they begin to tell testimonies and had soon forgotten what had been done yesterday he said but when that storm rose up they soon forgot what it was and all of Hell decided I got them all in the same boat so I'll kill them and brother bam talks about the boat they were in he said but after a little while Peter said somebody go wake the master somebody go wake the master brother B said see their fear amen there was no reason for their fear the master was in the boat and brother Bram says it I love how brother Bram teaches you know he's a he's a simple teacher he said look he said that boat was maybe made out of a certain type of wood a shittum wood or it was made I don't remember what the wood was now but it was made out of a certain kind of wood he says he says see that was a ship made out of wood he said but in these last days God has a ship made out of mud he has a dirt ship he said lose the an mud Texas mud can I add some Arkansas mud amen and the devil has got on every wave of your life and said I'm going to stop that boat but don't you forget that the master is in this mud boat don't for don't don't ever forget it he said we're going to the other side brother I don't care how many Devils I don't care how many demons rise up against this church we are going to the other side I say somebody ought to wake up the master tonight somebody ought to say wake up I know you think you're going to be lost you're not going to be lost they were secure in that boat and the believer is eternally secure say wake up the master wake up the master trouble everywhere wake up the master let me say storms are there but it ain't the storms on the outside that get you as long as the water stays on the outside of the boat you're just fine but brother when it starts getting in the boat it's time to wait the master get the boat calm the storm would you stand to your feet with me tonight oh I'll tell you yes Afflicted but not defeated uhhuh I tell you that's Unstoppable it's because there's a vision we're going to the other side there's a vision the little boy was going to wake up in Finland he's going to get up out of the Dead how could he wake himself how could he wake himself but the vision said he would rise see the vision says he would rise listen the trials of these this of the trials of faith is never going to stop this Pride oh I got so many good things sorry trials are never stop her that really isn't that what Satan's tried to do stop her isn't that really what the purpose is the failures do you know the Bible said in Romans 8 that he freely give us all things Romans 8th chapter it says it that he freely give us all things and brother man preaches that message pardon you know what he says he says if he give us all things I want to speak on one thing the pardon he gave so here the day I got to studying that word it's it's actually an English word pardon and how because the King James version is the one that uses it say he paronthi and I thought wow where did they get that word I mean how did they come up with a word pardon you know in in the Bible because it's written in Hebrew and then they use the English word pardon well it actually comes from like way back in the 600s that that the British kings are Kings and they call it by divine right they don't they're not elected King they believe God made them King so they're Divine Right Kings and they found that there were times that people were in trouble and they needed to release them and the way they would do it is they would call it a Divine progator of mercy so they could they could it was their progator to show Mercy 1500s they actually made it law that only a king could use it and then when they made that they called it an act of Grace thank you Lord so the Kings and British they could they could pardon someone and they called it an act of Grace now that's how that got into America was through George Washington when the nation first become a nation they had a rebellion right quick they had a rebellion against George Washington and he was trying to stay the Rebellion because they were all Americans but there was a rebellion so if you can't forgive it how can the Rebellion ever end so George Washington invoked the rot he had saw the kings use and he pardoned all the rebellion in his nation and all they had to do was turn and come and receive their pardon George Washington used that to calm the rebellion and to make them citizens he did the same thing do you know when you know when President Lincoln amen that's how he began to cause the divide the Civil War to become in unity again is he give a blanket pardon to any of the rebels that could deny that they were against America America they if they would pledge allegiance and receive they could have a pardon I looked on the internet the other day and there's little pardon notes written on every kind of paper you could find it's all over the Internet you can find little pieces of paper from the office executive branch signed Abraham Lincoln full pardon and he was handing out pardons like crazy because he was trying to end a a civil war see if if if there's no way for them to to be pardoned how could they ever be a nation again so he was causing his enemies to become his brothers through a pardon what what what's our president's name the rebel president is it Jackson no ST no that's Stonewall Jackson I I've got the name written down on here huh Andrew Andrew Jackson yeah it's Andrew Jackson what yeah he's the president of the of the Rebellion the southern [Music] states what in the world come on you bunch of rebelson Davis Jefferson Davis thank you I knew it wasn't Andrew Jackson because Andrew Jackson's the one that pardoned Jefferson Davis Andrew Jackson was the president of the United States Jefferson Davis was the rebel president that led the rebellion and he actually pardoned him and brought him back in now y'all heard brother B tell the story The pardon with Abraham Lin you heard that well let me say this I couldn't find that specific case although there's thousands of Pardons sold it but I did find one that Wilson versus the United States and there was two men robbed a mail truck and they were going to be killed this Wilson was given a pardon and he denied it and they killed him right now in Supreme Court there is a ruling that reads that a pardon must be delivered to be a pardon and to make the full delivery it has to be accepted oh yeah other words a pardon isn't delivered until the pardon is accepted it's in your law it says in the law now this is powerful that a president can give a pardon from the executive branch and the Congress has no right at all to impede to impede because it is his prerogative or his right yeah and it wasn't given to the Justice Branch it was given to the executive branch brother I tell you what you talking about you talking about something wonderful you said preacher what are you talking about I'm talking about I'm talking about when Ford pardon Nixon he pardoned the man you know why amen now hey let's let's update it could we can we update it when President Trump come in office and there was 16,700 uh uh uh fellow Americans that were in great trouble what'd he do he pardoned them made people mad well they did this and they did this and they did this but a president could just pardon them and nobody impede his right to just pardon him glory to God I tell you what I I was pretty excited about that and then I found out what every Republican was mad about is Joe Biden yeah the last minutes him walking out of the office you know what he did he preemptively pardoned his own children Oh my he preemptively done it you think about this you say I want if God can pardon me let me tell you this he preemptively pardoned you he put your name on the Lamb's Book of Life and challenged that devil to bring an accusation against a child of God God preemptively pardoned you I say devil bring on whatever you got God's already pardoned the [Applause] church brother W I tell you you talk about shout materal as a colored lady the other day in Memphis she went to jail a life sentence for probably for marijuana pretty much which is legal right now in America a life sentence she was serving but Kardashian actually went and talked to Trump eight years ago or six years ago and got her out of got her out of jail early and and Mr Clinton uh Mr Trump didn't only sign a clemency he ended up giving that woman a full pardon but today he just just two or three days ago he called the woman in the office who is a pardon felon and makes her a pardon Zar right makes her over the office of Pardons he took a felon forgave her and then put her over the office of making other people pardon brother I tell you what I am a pardon Zar God found me save me pardon me and tonight I want you to know I got a pardon for every one of you John 3:16 said God so loved the world he gave his only begotten son Mr brother Wayne how's that a pardon cuz it said he that believeth not is condemned already you was already condemned but your dirt had something on the inside that God found valuable I tell you tonight how many receive that pardon so brother way I receive it tonight I receive it I know we're Afflicted but I believe it I know I'm dirt but there's something in me tonight and I tell you I want to serve God with all of my heart that's by our hearts almighty God we come into this building tonight Lord the the the the the altars are full Lord there's no way to get anyone to an altar but I pray it be like it was in the original Church to as

piled up on the minds of these poor Saints has tried to deflect them and defeat them I pray tonight that this preemptive pardon would have such much power Lord it'll destroy the works of this devil

wonderful man deity inside of all that dirt is that powerful brother Wester you mean to tell me that something came out of Heaven a deposit of deity I about run all over this building if it wasn't interrupted the preaching a deposit of deity has been deposited in my life I I I don't know about everybody else's but I know it was in mine I can't speak on everybody else's behalf but I'm going tell you this country boy likes that to think that God the god of Heaven deposited something in me before I ever had an opportunity to ever make a mistake that there was a life in me that went beyond the life of this flesh isn't that a wonder how many how many can thank God for that tonight won't you give him another hand clap of praise tonight say Lord isn't it wonderful to know you in that way amen you know brother way he got to tell him that and I got to think about over in India I preached in a little village over there few years ago and and and the when they went out there they the church was real small had was a little round Hut kind of thing and had a thatch roof on it and the brothers took me there and you could hear all the people singing and we got to walk around there and it was only it was only about this tall and then the you know the roof the thatch roof over and I I got to walk around well how you how you supposed to get in there well over in the side they had a little hole and you had to kind of get down get down it wasn't no bigger than this Pulpit at the doorway so you had to kind of crawl to get into the church and I went in there and everybody they had it built down in the ground because of the weather it' get so hot out there and so they built it down to kind of keep it cool in the in the the building and and you know I I sitting there and got to looking around and and realize that they had built the entire Sanctuary out of dirt it was just a mud hut and the brother got to telling me and you know here there's a river right there next door and he said you know I said well it's a wonderful place that y'all built he said well he said just enjoy it for a little while for in a couple months it ain't going to be here I said well what do you mean he said well every year there's a monsoon that comes through and during monsoon season he said it just comes through and it wipes all this out he said there ain't nothing left of it I said well brother that's just terrible what do y'all do then he said we just build it back again he said cuz the life that's on the inside is better than the dirt that's on the outside I thought brother that preach right there and it did tonight there's something on the inside of it sometimes it just gets torn down sometimes it's trampled by storms it may get washed away by some great storm that came through but there's a life on the inside that'll just build it back up again I thank God that we have a life inside of our dir by the grace of Jesus Christ but the Wayne said it wasn't the Justice branch that had a right to give Grace it was the executive branch I thought thank God that it was cuz it wasn't Justice that we needed it was the grace of Jesus Christ it wasn't what we deserve but it's the grace of Jesus I thank God that there was a greater Branch than the branch of justice that was put over my life but the power of Grace has been bestowed upon us that makes me want to Worship the Lord tonight

came out of that you know why your testimony means so much just like a mama when she has a little baby after he gets a few months old and that baby has made thousands of step in its life but the one
