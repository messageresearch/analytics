[47:41] brother Joe preaching Wednesday night I
[47:43] had one one brother wasn't there

[47:48] online it was that and that was
[47:49] wonderful I wish I'd have been there I
[47:51] like well we're going to have to make a
[47:52] way to be there amen but it was still
[47:54] good even just to watch it but I just
[47:56] appreciate God's men uh being
[47:59] surrendered to the Lord and allowing God
[48:00] to use them I believe God does that amen
[48:03] you still believe that this morning you
[48:04] believe God can speak to you out of his
[48:06] word amen so let's just read out of
[48:08] Romans the 8th chapter in the first
[48:10] verse Paul said there is therefore now
[48:13] no condemnation to them which are in
[48:15] Christ Jesus who walk not after the
[48:18] flesh but after the spirit we'll just
[48:20] ask the Lord to add a blessing to the
[48:22] reading of the word as you take your
[48:24] seats I want to speak this morning on a
[48:26] subject of you are Christ and uh he said
[48:30] we walk not after the flesh but after
[48:33] the spirit I believe there's so much
[48:34] power in this scripture and that that
[48:37] can be released upon the church I got to
[48:39] diging into this one little verse it's
[48:41] so much you can find in one verse of
[48:43] scripture any if you ever if you ever
[48:45] study I know a lot of you study the the
[48:47] word and and you get to digging in there
[48:50] and finding all the Nuggets that God has
[48:52] in there for us and I get to reading in
[48:54] this scripture and then I I I spent all
[48:56] week in in just a couple of words just
[48:57] looking at all the things that God has
[49:00] in there and you know there's a lot of
[49:01] power that can be released upon the
[49:03] church and and I feel like that if God
[49:06] has something for us we ought
[49:24] to
[49:30] they may not like you but that's okay I
[49:32] love you and so I'm glad to be a part of
[49:34] you how many loves one another how

[50:28] proud to be a believer I'm proud of all
[50:31] the things that God has done I like to
[50:32] talk about it I I like to hear him
[50:34] talked about and I you know we' we've
[50:36] seen God do so much in our church and
[50:39] how how many testify that what the
[50:40] things that you've seen God do how many
[50:42] say this to if I if I say something that
[50:44] you've saw then you go ahead and say
[50:46] Amen we've seen the eyes that were blind
[50:48] come open amen I've seen the dead that
[50:51] was raised and I I I I saw those that
[50:53] were lame that couldn't walk and and God
[50:55] give them strength again where they
[50:57] could walk again and I've seen cancer
[50:59] that was healed and I've seen Souls that
[51:01] were saved and I've seen alcoholics that
[51:04] were delivered and I've seen drug
[51:05] addicts that it looked like they were on
[51:07] death row and they were locked in a jail
[51:09] cell and looked like they had never
[51:10] escaped but at the spirit of God that
[51:12] would come down in their life and he
[51:14] would turn their life around and here
[51:15] they stand as Sons and Daughters of God
[51:18] worshiping God living a life that's
[51:20] clean from drugs and alcohol he's a
[51:22] deliverer he's a savior he's a Healer
[51:24] and I'm so glad to be a part of God's
[51:26] church this morning there's so much that
[51:29] God has done in the Church of the Living
[51:31] God it a it ain't just some old dead
[51:32] church somewhere but it's a it's a
[51:34] church that is moving and growing in the
[51:36] very word of God and I believe that God
[51:38] has something for the church and there
[51:40] there's there there's desires that God
[51:42] has that he wants to pour out upon the
[51:44] church this morning but Bram said like
[51:45] this he said God will raise up all kinds
[51:48] of things in the church if the church
[51:51] would just get in a condition to receive
[51:53] it I thought isn't that something that
[51:55] you want why is there healing in the
[51:56] church cuz the church is in the
[51:57] condition to receive it why is there a
[51:59] Revival in the church cuz the church got
[52:01] in a condition to receive it why why
[52:03] would there be Deliverance that would
[52:05] come in the house of God it would only
[52:07] be because the church got in a condition
[52:09] to receive it uh he said he will never
[52:11] build his foundation upon something that
[52:13] man has laid because there's no other
[52:15] Foundation that can be laid than that
[52:17] which was already laid which was Christ
[52:19] Jesus the son of God he's the same
[52:22] yesterday today and forever I isn't it
[52:24] something brother wesy that means if you
[52:26] want to see God do some mighty things
[52:28] today then the church would have to get
[52:30] in a condition to receive the things of
[52:32] God if you want to see the supernatural
[52:34] in your life then you'll have to get in
[52:35] a condition to receive the things of God
[52:38] it ain't that God's running out of
[52:39] things to give it ain't that God is
[52:41] running out of the supernatural it isn't
[52:43] that God is running out of Miracles it's
[52:45] the church had to get in a a condition
[52:47] to be able to receive the things of God
[52:50] he said it must be built on the right
[52:52] foundation friends I'm here to tell you
[52:54] this morning as we're laying a
[52:55] foundation but in order for a church to
[52:58] get in the condition to receive it had
[53:00] to lay the right foundation it doesn't
[53:02] matter if you want to see God do
[53:04] something special it'll have to be built
[53:05] on the right foundation the church if
[53:07] the church would have to be built that
[53:09] way the house of God the local assembly
[53:11] every part of the work of God it would
[53:13] have to be built on a foundation it
[53:15] couldn't be a foundation that was laid
[53:17] by a man but you won't see this
[53:19] Supernatural God moving in the in the
[53:21] Miracles of God and the blessings of God
[53:23] flowing upon a church that was built by
[53:25] by men but it would have to be built
[53:27] upon a foundation of Jesus Christ being
[53:29] the same yesterday today and forever and
[53:32] if you get that kind of foundation you
[53:34] don't have to worry about God doing his
[53:36] part cuz God's going to show up and
[53:38] he'll pour His Spirit out upon the
[53:39] church and every single blessing that
[53:42] God has will be given to you and to your
[53:44] life when it's established upon the
[53:46] foundation of Jesus Christ it has to be
[53:49] built on a right foundation that's what
[53:50] the Bible says Isaiah said I lay in Zion
[53:53] a foundation for a found Foundation a
[53:55] stone a tried Stone a precious
[53:58] Cornerstone and a sure Foundation if you
[54:00] want if you want a life of success as a
[54:03] Christian and you want to be able to be
[54:04] a a successful Christian in other words
[54:07] and to be able to receive the blessings
[54:08] of God and the spirit of God and not be
[54:11] uh feel like you're you're living in in
[54:13] depression all the time and always bound
[54:15] down and and barely being able to go to
[54:17] church but you want to be able to stand
[54:18] up as a rich Christian and so rich with
[54:21] the blessing or or the or the or the the
[54:23] very nature of God and the joy and the
[54:25] peace and the the longsuffering that
[54:27] comes with God then it had to be built
[54:29] upon a right foundation he said I lay in
[54:32] Zion a trid stone a precious Cornerstone
[54:35] a sure Foundation Peter Peter tells us
[54:37] he said whenever he speaks of of Isaiah
[54:41] he said this was Jesus that Isaiah was
[54:43] talking about he was the Cornerstone of
[54:45] the building that God is completing in
[54:48] the very age that we live in how many
[54:50] knows what a Cornerstone is a
[54:52] Cornerstone it was so is so careful how
[54:54] it was chosen it had to be carved out it
[54:57] had to be shaped just right it had it
[54:59] had to be the right size and the right
[55:01] dimensions and and all the angles on it
[55:03] had to be just right because it was
[55:05] going to hold the the very the very turn
[55:07] of the corner of the foundation of a
[55:09] home or a structure that was being built
[55:11] so if the Cornerstone isn't right or the
[55:14] foundation isn't right then nothing that
[55:16] you ever build on top of it will ever be
[55:18] right because it had to be right first
[55:21] and Peter said he said so when when God
[55:23] would come he be to talk about the house
[55:25] that God is building and he said see God
[55:27] is building a spiritual house this is
[55:29] what God is building in this day and
[55:31] Jesus is the perfect Foundation the very
[55:35] foundation stone that God has chosen for
[55:37] the house that he is building today he
[55:39] said that those who trust in him they
[55:42] are living stones so every one of us are
[55:44] part of the same house that God is
[55:46] building the very thing that God had in
[55:48] his mind before the foundation of the
[55:49] world he said God is the Jesus is the
[55:52] foundation stone he's the Cornerstone
[55:54] that God is building and you are the
[55:56] Lively stones that God is building in
[55:58] this spiritual house to bring forth
[56:00] sacrifices of Praises unto him he is
[56:03] building a spiritual house and brother
[56:05] Wesley it's built this morning upon a
[56:07] right foundation how many say Amen to
[56:09] that it it ain't it ain't just built
[56:11] upon a Theology of man but it's built
[56:13] upon a right foundation see your
[56:15] Christian walk brother Adam it can't be
[56:17] built upon a foundation of Flesh it has
[56:19] to be built on the spirit Paul said who
[56:21] walk not after the flesh but after the
[56:23] spirit it had to a right foundation I
[56:26] thought my there's so many things that
[56:27] we could build this spiritual house on
[56:29] how many ever look at yourself it's not
[56:31] just it's not just the body we live in
[56:33] but this is God's spiritual house and it
[56:35] had to be built on this right foundation
[56:36] that's why we can't go by the flesh or
[56:38] or Sensations or feelings and so many
[56:41] times you get to talking about or
[56:42] talking to people about the Lord and and
[56:44] the spirit of God and you know I've
[56:46] heard people say this you know well I
[56:48] know that the Lord was here cuz I I felt
[56:50] chill bumps from the bottom of of my
[56:52] feet to the top of my head and oh I know
[56:54] the Lord must have been here because the
[56:56] hair was Ted up on my arms so I know
[56:58] when the Lord comes by the hair always
[56:59] tends up on my arms well friends that
[57:02] that that's wonderful and you know what
[57:03] I I I got to think about that I said you
[57:05] know maybe when the spirit of the Lord
[57:06] does come maybe the hair does stand up
[57:08] on your arm you know why because your
[57:10] body it reacts to stimulation and
[57:13] sometimes you feel the the presence of
[57:14] God and and maybe maybe you do feel a
[57:17] chill when you when you when you feel
[57:18] the presence of God but I know this we
[57:20] can't rely on that to be a Vindication
[57:22] that God is present so maybe you do feel
[57:25] that when God comes but when you feel
[57:26] that it's no sign that God is really
[57:28] here but but but it's it's no sign of
[57:31] his presence and see we can't re rely on
[57:34] the flesh to know that God is present we
[57:37] can't rely on the flesh to to build a
[57:39] foundation our our life as a Believer we
[57:41] can't rely on the flesh to know that
[57:43] we're filled with the Holy Ghost we
[57:44] can't rely on the flesh to know that
[57:46] everything is okay with God everybody's
[57:48] looking for a for a for a a a a a flesh
[57:51] uh uh Vindication or a Vindication in
[57:54] our own mind to be able to prove who we
[57:56] are and what we are and where we came
[57:58] from and and what God is going to do
[57:59] with us but friends don't you realize it
[58:01] ain't got nothing to do with the way we
[58:03] feel it ain't got nothing to do with the
[58:05] the flesh or the feeling of the flesh or
[58:07] the or the thoughts that go through your
[58:08] mind it only matters where you came from
[58:10] and who your father is and how he
[58:12] created you and and what he established
[58:14] you in in the hour that we live in today
[58:18] brother B said see it can't rely on
[58:20] those things he said to know the secrets
[58:22] of the heart see if if that ain't a sign
[58:24] of his presence what is a sign of his
[58:26] presence he said to know the secrets of
[58:28] the heart was a sign of the Messiah
[58:31] isn't that right to know the seek
[58:33] remember the woman at the well when
[58:34] Jesus came to her or to him or to her
[58:37] and she and she she he began to tell her
[58:39] the things that was going on in her life
[58:41] and as it began to reveal to her what
[58:43] was going on she said I know when the
[58:44] Messiah comes he would do these things
[58:46] see it was to know the secrets of the
[58:48] heart it was the sign of a messiah but
[58:51] said what was it he said it was a
[58:53] messiah sign of his presence it was a
[58:56] Vindication that the Messiah was present
[58:58] friends isn't it wonderful that we saw
[59:00] that same thing in the age that we live
[59:02] in we don't have to wonder if God is
[59:04] present because we've saw the sign of a
[59:07] messiah I know I know there's a lot of
[59:08] people out there today that try to
[59:10] duplicate that same sign and and try to
[59:12] imitate it and try to mimic it but
[59:14] friends I thank God today that I don't
[59:16] have to mimic the ministry of another
[59:18] man in order to build a Ministry for
[59:20] myself I'm what God made me and he was
[59:22] what God made him and I thank God that
[59:24] he he would send a messiah sign in this
[59:27] age in order to turn the people of God
[59:29] back to the word of God that we could be
[59:32] built on a right foundation it ain't
[59:34] built on flesh it ain't built on the
[59:36] thoughts that that go through our mind
[59:38] we don't and we don't have to recreate
[59:40] that it was God's Messiah sign that came
[59:42] in this hour it's once to an age that
[59:44] God brought brought that sign in order
[59:46] to turn us back to the word that we
[59:49] could find our our right foundation you
[59:50] say well what is it today you mean God
[59:52] ain't doing that anymore no I don't mean
[59:54] that God's still doing it in the Bride
[59:56] of Jesus Christ how does he do it
[59:58] according to the word of God the Bible
[1:00:00] said the word of God is a discerner of
[1:00:02] the thoughts and the intents of our
[1:00:03] heart that means when you come in the
[1:00:05] house of God how many how many can
[1:00:07] testify I had a lady tell me last last
[1:00:09] uh uh a couple weeks ago she said you
[1:00:11] know when you got done preaching she
[1:00:13] said you must have been driving in the
[1:00:14] car with me and my husband because we
[1:00:16] were talking about something that nobody
[1:00:17] ever talks about and if you didn't get
[1:00:19] up there and start preaching the very
[1:00:21] thing how many can ever testify that
[1:00:22] when you come in the house of God and
[1:00:24] the the Holy Spirit begins to speak to
[1:00:26] to us through through the ministers that
[1:00:28] come in the pullit it's the very thing
[1:00:30] it's the it's that same Messiah the word
[1:00:33] of God that's working through the Bride
[1:00:35] of Jesus Christ and when you preach the
[1:00:37] very message that God has given to the
[1:00:39] church in this last age he still
[1:00:41] ministers to the hearts of the Bride of
[1:00:43] Jesus Christ that's what we need today
[1:00:45] we don't need to duplicate the sign we
[1:00:47] need to preach the message that he
[1:00:49] preached and allow the spirit of God to
[1:00:51] minister to the bride and to put her in
[1:00:53] her place amen I say amen amen that's
[1:00:56] all free amen that's what that's what
[1:00:59] we're called to do to preach the message
[1:01:01] of the hour and let God's message
[1:01:03] vindicate himself over and over again to
[1:01:06] his bride they ain't our people anyway
[1:01:08] they're God's people they ain't our
[1:01:10] bride anyway it's God's bride they ain't
[1:01:12] our children anyway it's God's children
[1:01:14] it ain't our church anyway it's God's
[1:01:16] Church it ain't our message anyway it's
[1:01:18] God's message and I say let him speak to
[1:01:20] his children this
[1:01:22] morning we don't have to do licate
[1:01:25] anything we can just be who we are we're
[1:01:27] message preachers and we took the
[1:01:28] message that God has given us in this
[1:01:30] hour and we can stand on it and be able
[1:01:32] to feed it to the children of God and it
[1:01:35] still does the same thing to them today
[1:01:37] that it did 50 years
[1:01:39] ago amen it's God's message to his
[1:01:43] children there's a reality to it said
[1:01:46] what is it it's a holy ghost meeting
[1:01:48] when the spirit of God begins to move in
[1:01:50] an assembly it does the same thing that
[1:01:53] it's always done you really realize that
[1:01:55] God has called his church to be a
[1:01:57] spiritual people isn't it something that
[1:01:59] today that that's almost a mockery for a
[1:02:01] person to be a spiritual person you you
[1:02:05] get us some sister a prayer Warrior and
[1:02:07] and and see God do something or maybe
[1:02:09] see the pillar fire or something like
[1:02:11] that people just kind of pick on them
[1:02:12] and make fun of them for the things that
[1:02:14] they see and and the things that they
[1:02:15] say because we it's it's been built up
[1:02:18] as a mockery to even be spiritual you
[1:02:20] you think you anything you watch or or
[1:02:22] or you know Hollywood or the world has
[1:02:24] been built it up that it's a strange
[1:02:26] thing or or or these spooky things or
[1:02:28] something that's moving around little
[1:02:30] Spirits or Spooks and they they've even
[1:02:32] took demon spirits and took demonology
[1:02:34] and made it a a holiday out of it on
[1:02:36] Halloween where where where it's not
[1:02:39] something to even uh be afraid of or
[1:02:41] it's just you know it's just some make
[1:02:42] believe or something like that they
[1:02:43] they've took the very reality out of
[1:02:45] even being spiritual but friends let me
[1:02:47] tell you a secret this morning there is
[1:02:49] a spiritual real there's a real
[1:02:52] spiritual real and you you let me ask
[1:02:54] you where do they get the inspiration
[1:02:55] for it you think about it there's a real
[1:02:57] spiritual realm and you know I I used to
[1:02:59] talk to people that that they they
[1:03:01] didn't go to church at all and one of
[1:03:02] the easiest ways to explain that would
[1:03:04] would what everybody listens to music
[1:03:06] and I'd tell you you know well you know
[1:03:08] if you ever listen to any songs you you
[1:03:09] notice how one song makes you feel one
[1:03:11] way and another song makes you feel the
[1:03:13] other I remember when we were in high
[1:03:15] school and in in the sports and our Old
[1:03:17] Coach had come in there and you know
[1:03:18] what he' do he' say don't nobody talk we
[1:03:20] wasn't allowed to talk before the game
[1:03:21] but they go over there and they Crank
[1:03:23] That Old jukebox up and man it it would
[1:03:24] crank out the worst music in the world
[1:03:27] but whatever it was about the music that
[1:03:28] he chose made you feel like you could
[1:03:30] run through the wall me Logan you you
[1:03:33] played back there me go in that old
[1:03:35] locker room and Welly they' had that
[1:03:36] cranking them boys they they they
[1:03:38] gritting their teeth and holding their
[1:03:39] helmets in their heads and my and and
[1:03:41] they're stomping their feet getting
[1:03:43] ready to go ready to rip the head off of
[1:03:44] the kid next that come on the other bus
[1:03:46] wearing the other color shirt why it was
[1:03:48] a spiritual realm that they were taking
[1:03:50] them into to may all all of a sudden you
[1:03:53] see that music it does does that that's
[1:03:55] why that's why David went and played
[1:03:56] before Saul whenever the demons or or
[1:03:59] Spirits would battle him he would call
[1:04:00] up on S David to come and play A
[1:04:02] Spiritual music and and something that
[1:04:04] was PE peaceful to drive evil spirits
[1:04:07] out away from him see it was if you ever
[1:04:10] watch a I got thinking about that last
[1:04:11] night I thought my isn't it something if
[1:04:13] you ever watch a scary movie I don't I'm
[1:04:15] not going to ask you to raise hands but
[1:04:16] if you ever watch a scary movie you know
[1:04:19] it wouldn't even be scary without the
[1:04:20] music can you imagine here here's a guy
[1:04:23] holding a head and you're like well
[1:04:25] that's just an actor holding a fake head
[1:04:26] it wouldn't even it wouldn't even scare
[1:04:28] you but because they put the music in
[1:04:30] there with it they they they got they
[1:04:31] they got orchestras that are that that
[1:04:33] have so well found the chords that that
[1:04:36] that that bring fear and they'll get the
[1:04:38] D you know play in that old D music and
[1:04:41] and building it up and the little
[1:04:42] creaking of the door and the door begins
[1:04:44] to Creek and you'll hear the wind blow
[1:04:46] see without sound it wouldn't even you
[1:04:49] wouldn't even it wouldn't even be scary
[1:04:51] at all but but all of a sudden you know
[1:04:52] it gets to moveing and then that old
[1:04:54] creeper comes through there I remember
[1:04:56] when I was a kid you'd be scared to
[1:04:57] death if there were if there was some
[1:04:59] scary thing because the music will get
[1:05:00] you it would get you so scared and go
[1:05:03] behind the bushes and then Scooby-Doo he
[1:05:05] pull that white sheet off of him you
[1:05:06] realize it was just the Baker from down
[1:05:08] the street but before you scared to
[1:05:10] death because because because the music
[1:05:12] that was playing see it's a it's a
[1:05:15] spiritual real it Le it's a it deals
[1:05:19] with you on a spiritual level it causes
[1:05:21] you you know some songs that make people
[1:05:23] depressed and some songs they make
[1:05:24] people happy and some song this isn't
[1:05:27] emotions it's a spiritual level music
[1:05:29] deals with on a on a spiritual realm and
[1:05:31] and you realize that whenever these that
[1:05:34] these spirits that are real and in this
[1:05:35] spiritual realm Spirits they go from one
[1:05:38] person to another do you realize you can
[1:05:39] be around somebody and you'll notice
[1:05:41] that that you'll pick up the things that
[1:05:43] they do and they say it ain't that
[1:05:45] you're just mimicking them but but but
[1:05:47] you're picking up on the spirit of
[1:05:48] another person you know they Pastor one
[1:05:50] I remember brother brother David Siler
[1:05:53] he told told us a few few years ago when
[1:05:54] he used to Pastor up in Salem that he
[1:05:56] was on a call he used to be a a medic or
[1:05:59] EMT and then on the fire department and
[1:06:01] he got a call for for uh brother brother
[1:06:04] Travis you you were there but there was
[1:06:06] a but there was a man that had committed
[1:06:08] suicide in right there in in Salem he
[1:06:10] said we went over and and then they done
[1:06:12] the suicide call and and then we went
[1:06:14] back to the station we was on our way
[1:06:15] back to the station and and somebody
[1:06:17] called in and said you know hey and gave
[1:06:19] the street address that somebody
[1:06:20] committed suicide and the dispatcher was
[1:06:22] telling them about we've already
[1:06:23] addressed that had already been there
[1:06:24] tooken care of it he said when they
[1:06:26] looked at the address it wasn't even the
[1:06:27] same address it was just one or one
[1:06:29] number different or one street over he
[1:06:31] said he something like that it was so
[1:06:33] odd because they they had took they had
[1:06:35] they had already went there and then
[1:06:36] here there was another one he said so
[1:06:37] then we went down there and they went we
[1:06:39] dress that and and what and maybe the
[1:06:41] next day or something next day or a
[1:06:43] couple days later it happened again
[1:06:45] right there in the same little area and
[1:06:47] said and and they can't figure out what
[1:06:48] it was that caused it the people wasn't
[1:06:50] related they didn't know they didn't
[1:06:51] know each other it wasn't like a a
[1:06:53] relationship ship or anything like that
[1:06:55] but what would cause it said but see you
[1:06:57] know I got thinking that you know the
[1:06:59] the the world don't have an answer for
[1:07:00] that the you matter of fact you can read
[1:07:02] the the CDC they they don't they don't
[1:07:04] have an answer they call it a suicide
[1:07:05] cluster they'll say well well when
[1:07:07] several suicides occur in a certain
[1:07:09] place or time that that that that it
[1:07:12] happens that there's no they don't have
[1:07:13] an answer to why it happens that way in
[1:07:15] fact on their own website they write it
[1:07:17] like this there is not one place that a
[1:07:20] cluster is more likely to occur they
[1:07:22] occur in a variety of locations or
[1:07:24] settings so it don't matter where you
[1:07:26] are it don't matter who you are it don't
[1:07:28] matter how rich they are or how poor
[1:07:30] they are they have no distinction to be
[1:07:32] able to find out what causes this
[1:07:34] amongst people and but friends I but I
[1:07:36] can prove to you it's a spirit because
[1:07:38] here you know when this when this Spirit
[1:07:40] comes because because uh uh whenever
[1:07:42] Jesus went down and he be to uh to
[1:07:44] minister to the the the the man the that
[1:07:47] the gadan that was that was was filled
[1:07:49] with the evil spirits and whenever he
[1:07:50] went down there and ministered to him
[1:07:52] and that that he came in the the Bible
[1:07:54] says that whenever the spirits left him
[1:07:55] they asked Jesus to give him a place to
[1:07:57] go and he sent him into the swine and
[1:07:59] the swine ran off of the cliff see so it
[1:08:02] was a spirit that caused them to do it
[1:08:04] it was a a spirit that they were
[1:08:05] Anointed with even though they may have
[1:08:07] been good people and there may be one
[1:08:09] day they sered the Lord the Bible says
[1:08:10] serve the Lord while you're in your
[1:08:12] right mind or and one day you may lose
[1:08:13] it and maybe something that happened
[1:08:15] that caused them to lose their mind and
[1:08:17] they would they go into some condition
[1:08:19] that uh that that that that they they
[1:08:20] wouldn't ordinarily be in see because it
[1:08:22] was a spirit that calls them to do it
[1:08:24] and you know I I know that they when
[1:08:27] they read this they say the worst thing
[1:08:29] is is that it's spread by talking about
[1:08:31] it so they'll take the news media and
[1:08:33] they'll say well they can't do it
[1:08:35] because the media goes to sharing
[1:08:36] stories and it causes another person to
[1:08:39] do it and they don't want the media
[1:08:40] around they said because it'll it'll
[1:08:42] trigger because it'll show the place
[1:08:44] where it took place or show grieving
[1:08:46] families or or get the talking about it
[1:08:48] and it'll trigger that in somebody else
[1:08:50] cuz they'll get to thinking about
[1:08:52] somebody else that has gone through that
[1:08:53] and then they start battling it in their
[1:08:55] own mind and and and because they
[1:08:58] because they know of somebody or or or
[1:09:00] or theyve seen somebody go through it
[1:09:02] and seen somebody grieving but but but
[1:09:04] the reality of it is is that it's just
[1:09:06] an Avenue for that Spirit to minister to
[1:09:09] another person you realize that all it
[1:09:11] is they say well we don't know what
[1:09:13] triggers it but talking about it
[1:09:14] triggers it or looking at pictures of
[1:09:15] them triggers it or seeing somebody
[1:09:17] grief triggers it but really it's just
[1:09:19] an Avenue that a spirit can minister to
[1:09:21] another person but I thought my if
[1:09:23] that's that way with a demon Spirit
[1:09:25] think about it if a demon Spirit can be
[1:09:28] shared by showing or talking about
[1:09:30] something then what about a holy spirit
[1:09:32] if a demon Spirit can be passed from one
[1:09:34] person to another by talking about
[1:09:36] something or talking about somebody
[1:09:38] grieving then how about a holy spirit
[1:09:40] this morning oh my if a demon Spirit can
[1:09:43] be passed a spirit of suicide or a
[1:09:45] spirit of depression or the spirit or
[1:09:47] these spirits that go around the world
[1:09:49] if they can be passed around by
[1:09:51] testifying of the works of the devil
[1:09:53] then how much more can we pass around
[1:09:55] the Holy Spirit by testifying of the
[1:09:58] works of almighty God wonder what happen
[1:10:00] if we start testifying of the works of
[1:10:02] God this morning quit talking about what
[1:10:04] the devil done the devil can't do one
[1:10:06] thing to anybody that God didn't allow
[1:10:08] the devil can't take nobody that God
[1:10:10] didn't allow the devil can't take nobody
[1:10:12] before their time it takes God to allow
[1:10:14] it to happen but the devil will use
[1:10:17] something and call and drag somebody
[1:10:19] into some thought or in the back of
[1:10:21] their mind that one day that'll be my
[1:10:23] end one day that'll be my friends I I
[1:10:25] don't know why I'm here this morning but
[1:10:27] one day that'll be my destruction and
[1:10:28] one day that that that's going to be my
[1:10:30] result and you won't ever had to tell
[1:10:32] anybody about it but God knows about it
[1:10:34] this morning brother and he would send a
[1:10:37] word think about it if the if the
[1:10:39] testifying of bad things would lead send
[1:10:42] that kind of spirit around what about
[1:10:44] testifying of the works of God but said
[1:10:46] we went to Finland one time he was on a
[1:10:48] missionary trip when they got out there
[1:10:50] he said we passed by some workers that
[1:10:52] was working in a field and they came up
[1:10:54] on their lunch break and they gathered
[1:10:55] up underneath the tree he said so we
[1:10:57] stopped by under the tree to testify to
[1:10:59] them of the works of God they got around
[1:11:02] and handed out some pamphlets he said we
[1:11:03] passed out a few pamphlets and had
[1:11:05] prayer and we begin to talk about the
[1:11:07] Lord and 17 people received the Holy
[1:11:09] Ghost under that tree right there just
[1:11:12] because we stopped by and to spread a
[1:11:14] little gospel truth to some hungry-heart
[1:11:16] people I think it's time we stop
[1:11:18] testifying for the things that the devil
[1:11:21] done and Testify the works of God wonder
[1:11:23] if there's any hungry-heart people here
[1:11:25] this morning that we could testify about
[1:11:28] the or to spread a little gospel truth I
[1:11:31] think that's what we ought to do this
[1:11:32] morning I think we ought to spread a
[1:11:34] little gospel truth when you're lost
[1:11:36] he's a place to find Salvation when
[1:11:38] you're hungry he's bread for your soul
[1:11:41] when you're thirsty he'll give you
[1:11:42] living water when you need shelter he'll
[1:11:44] be a refuge for you I think we ought to
[1:11:47] spread a little gospel truth brother
[1:11:49] Bram said it's a privilege to stand
[1:11:51] before one person Hallelujah it's a
[1:11:54] privilege to stand before one person and
[1:11:56] talk about the Lord Jesus isn't it a
[1:11:59] privilege he said I've noticed in my
[1:12:01] Ministry it don't matter to God whether
[1:12:03] there's a dozen or there's thousands he
[1:12:05] has the same message all the time for
[1:12:07] the people it's the grace of Jesus
[1:12:09] Christ I think I think that it don't
[1:12:11] matter if there's one or a thousand
[1:12:13] brother Wesley it's the same message if
[1:12:16] there's one or a thousand it'll bring
[1:12:17] the same result if there's one or a
[1:12:19] thousand it'll liberate you it'll free
[1:12:22] you it'll free the one it'll free the
[1:12:24] Thousand there's times in the Bible
[1:12:26] there was 3,000 Souls that was saved and
[1:12:28] many times there's just one it don't
[1:12:30] matter how many is there it I think we
[1:12:33] ought to spread a little gospel
[1:12:35] truth I think it's okay to spread a
[1:12:37] little gospel truth this morning the
[1:12:39] truth is you don't belong to the devil
[1:12:41] you belong to God I feel like preaching
[1:12:44] a little bit I think we ought to spread
[1:12:45] a little gospel truth the truth is that
[1:12:47] ain't your end the truth is that ain't
[1:12:50] where you're going the truth is that
[1:12:52] wasn't for you
[1:12:54] you you belong to God the truth is you
[1:12:57] was made in His
[1:12:59] image you wern't made in the devil's
[1:13:01] image you just made in the image of God
[1:13:03] the truth is you ain't got to look like
[1:13:04] the world you didn't come from the world
[1:13:07] you came from God it's a little gospel
[1:13:09] truth the truth is you're made for a
[1:13:11] purpose the truth is is that God's
[1:13:14] purpose never fails the truth is that
[1:13:17] you belong to God before the foundation
[1:13:19] of the world the truth is that that that
[1:13:21] there happen to be a fall in the garden
[1:13:23] and when that fall came there was a
[1:13:25] great Chasm that separated God from man
[1:13:27] but when Jesus Christ came on the earth
[1:13:29] he took that Chasm away and he brought
[1:13:32] men back together with God again that's
[1:13:34] the
[1:13:35] truth and we belong to God we go through
[1:13:39] trials and sometimes we may feel like
[1:13:41] God's forsaken us and all these things
[1:13:43] but the Bible says many are the
[1:13:44] afflictions of the righteous but the
[1:13:45] Lord
[1:13:53] present when you start testifying of the
[1:13:55] things of God he comes present in a
[1:13:58] spiritual realm we're not talking about
[1:14:00] in the flesh I'm talking about the
[1:14:02] spirit of God will come present how many
[1:14:04] testify that some of you elders just sit
[1:14:05] around talk about the Lord and and and
[1:14:07] the spirit of the Lord would just come
[1:14:08] into the room I believe he's here this
[1:14:10] morning you just enter into the room and
[1:14:12] begin to minister to somebody's heart
[1:14:14] and am I you you just sit sometimes you
[1:14:16] break down and sometimes you cry
[1:14:18] sometimes you jump up and down sometimes
[1:14:20] you shout and but what it's the spirit
[1:14:22] of God that enters into the room but let
[1:14:25] me tell you this friends that when you
[1:14:26] sit and you talk about the Lord that the
[1:14:28] Lord ain't the only one that comes you
[1:14:31] remember the disciples that day when
[1:14:32] they were going out across the sea and
[1:14:35] here they had just left a great miracle
[1:14:37] that they had just saw Jesus feed these
[1:14:39] thousands of people that had gathered
[1:14:41] around some some you know estimate 10
[1:14:43] 15,000 people there the Bible said 5,000
[1:14:46] men and plus the women and the children
[1:14:48] that were that were all gathered there
[1:14:49] to hear him Minister but he had after he
[1:14:52] had fed him he took two two fish and
[1:14:53] five loaves of bread and he broke it and
[1:14:56] fed them and after every one of them
[1:14:58] were fed by those two fish can you
[1:14:59] imagine the miracle that they saw that
[1:15:01] every time he would take another piece
[1:15:03] of fish it was God the Creator God and
[1:15:05] he would break off another piece and
[1:15:07] they' pass it on to another one and he
[1:15:08] would as he was breaking it he would
[1:15:10] hand it to the ministers and tell the
[1:15:12] ministers to to go out before the people
[1:15:14] and and and feed them the the the bread
[1:15:16] of life and make sure that that their
[1:15:18] that their bellies are full and the
[1:15:20] Bible said they all left and they were
[1:15:21] satisfied and they took up baskets of
[1:15:23] left over that's right there was enough
[1:15:26] for everybody in baskets that were left
[1:15:28] over when they were done and here the
[1:15:31] disciples as they were going out across
[1:15:33] the sea they got to talking about the
[1:15:34] things that they had just seen brother
[1:15:36] bam tells it so well in testimony on the
[1:15:38] sea he said here they were going out
[1:15:40] across the sea and as they were going
[1:15:42] there he said you could just hear John
[1:15:43] as he was as they was talking about all
[1:15:45] the things that they had seen Jesus do
[1:15:47] and maybe one said you know it was
[1:15:48] something down there at the party the
[1:15:50] other day when he went in at at at the
[1:15:52] celebration
[1:15:53] and he and he took the the water when
[1:15:55] they ran out of wine and he just turned
[1:15:57] it into wine and everybody got all the
[1:15:59] wine that there it wasn't a miracle and
[1:16:01] may maybe John he said you know he said
[1:16:03] it wasn't nothing like what we've seen
[1:16:04] today he said you know let me tell you
[1:16:06] what that meant to me he said I remember
[1:16:08] when I was a little boy and brother B
[1:16:10] illustrates it he said I remember when I
[1:16:12] was a little boy he said my mama used to
[1:16:14] tell me about the children of Israel and
[1:16:15] how they came out of Egypt and when they
[1:16:17] got out in the wilderness that that they
[1:16:19] had no food to eat and they they got to
[1:16:21] turn into God and say well there ain't
[1:16:22] nothing out here for us to eat but then
[1:16:24] God rained Mana out of heaven and every
[1:16:26] day he fed him and May and John would
[1:16:29] sit there and he said you know oh even
[1:16:30] as a little boy I always wondered how
[1:16:32] would God be able to do a thing like
[1:16:34] that how could he sustain them two
[1:16:36] million people and you know did God have
[1:16:37] an oven or something up there that he
[1:16:39] would break bread or or bake bread and
[1:16:41] feed them you know how would God do
[1:16:42] something like that but but but his mom
[1:16:44] would say well God is a Creator and he's
[1:16:46] the one that made bread he's the one
[1:16:48] that made the wheat fills and he's the
[1:16:50] one that made the Wilderness and he's
[1:16:51] the one that made the dry places he made
[1:16:54] every Mountain he made the valley he
[1:16:56] made the trees he made life he's the
[1:16:58] creator of life and he could sustain
[1:17:00] them on their Wilderness Journey he said
[1:17:02] you know I maybe that was good enough
[1:17:04] for a while but I always wondered oh if
[1:17:06] I could ever see him do it wouldn't it
[1:17:08] be something to see him as he would ring
[1:17:10] Mana Out of Heaven you know I've always
[1:17:11] long to see God do a miracle like that
[1:17:14] and I was sitting there other day and I
[1:17:17] oh it just came back to my memory
[1:17:19] whenever that little boy took his lunch
[1:17:21] bucket and he took it up there and Jesus
[1:17:23] took it in his hands and he be to break
[1:17:25] it and he took that bread and every time
[1:17:27] he' break off a piece of bread it would
[1:17:29] multiply and it would feed another group
[1:17:31] and he'd break another piece and it
[1:17:32] would multiply he'd feed another group
[1:17:35] oh don't you realize it ain't just
[1:17:36] something that my mama told me this
[1:17:38] ain't just a testimony it ain't just a
[1:17:40] story from my uh from my ancestor it
[1:17:43] ain't a story where it came from but I
[1:17:44] got to see the living reality of the
[1:17:47] creator of God the very Creator God
[1:17:51] creating brother and as they started
[1:17:53] tell the testimony of the things of God
[1:17:56] all of a sudden while they were telling
[1:17:58] the testimony lo and behold the devil
[1:18:00] was out there and he didn't want to hear
[1:18:01] it no more see when you go talking about
[1:18:03] the lord the devil shows up too oh yeah
[1:18:06] he wanted to break up the party so here
[1:18:08] the devil come and the Bible said this
[1:18:09] great wind and and great storm Came Upon
[1:18:12] them tried to sink the boat but while
[1:18:14] while it looked like the storm would
[1:18:15] sink the boat and here they were in
[1:18:16] great fear they looked out across the
[1:18:19] water and here came a spirit walking on
[1:18:21] the water and they and they got a afraid
[1:18:23] because it was a spirit it looked like
[1:18:25] something spooky and Jesus spoke to them
[1:18:27] and he said be not be of good cheer it
[1:18:29] is I Be not Afraid the Bible says
[1:18:32] straight away he told him that I thought
[1:18:34] isn't that something he didn't allow him
[1:18:36] to stay in that state of fear very long
[1:18:38] but soon as it truck and they
[1:18:39] recognizing they got afraid of of the
[1:18:42] spirit of God they got afraid of the
[1:18:44] supernatural they got afraid of what was
[1:18:46] coming walking on the water but soon as
[1:18:48] the fear struck the Bible said but
[1:18:49] straight away Jesus corrected it he said
[1:18:52] be of good cheer it is I Be not Afraid
[1:18:55] don't be afraid of the spirit of God
[1:18:56] don't be afraid of the move of God don't
[1:18:58] be afraid of of Jesus walking on the
[1:19:01] water what was he doing he was
[1:19:03] overcoming the storm he was overcoming
[1:19:05] the devil that looked like he would take
[1:19:07] him out and I'm getting somewhere with
[1:19:09] this but but when he came walking out on
[1:19:11] there when and Peter said oh Lord if if
[1:19:14] that be you then won't you bid me to
[1:19:15] come you remember the story and and then
[1:19:17] and Jesus said well come and Peter
[1:19:19] stepped out of the ship the Bible said
[1:19:21] he went out of the ship and he walked on
[1:19:23] the water to go to Jesus he got out of
[1:19:26] it and he walked on the water to go to
[1:19:28] Jesus you say what was it that he done
[1:19:30] Peter stepped into a spiritual realm of
[1:19:33] Faith you realize the flesh man in the
[1:19:35] realm of Flesh had no ability to ever
[1:19:37] walk on water friend you go try it and
[1:19:39] see if it ain't the truth you get all
[1:19:41] the braveness you want to and try to
[1:19:43] muster it up and go walk across Black
[1:19:45] River and every one of you going to sink
[1:19:46] every time but he stepped into a
[1:19:48] different realm Jesus invited him on the
[1:19:51] water he stepped into a spiritual realm
[1:19:53] of faith and that spiritual realm of
[1:19:55] Faith defied the laws of Flesh he
[1:19:58] stepped out of out of Flesh he stepped
[1:20:00] out of Theology and into a spiritual
[1:20:02] that's what God wants us to do this
[1:20:03] morning to step out of an intellectual
[1:20:06] understanding of God and into a
[1:20:07] spiritual realm of Faith to step to step
[1:20:10] into a spiritual realm a place where God
[1:20:13] can minister to you Amen brother see
[1:20:15] that's the only way to get to Jesus
[1:20:17] ain't that something brother Wesley the
[1:20:19] only way to get to Jesus was to step
[1:20:21] into another Realm he couldn't get to
[1:20:23] him any other way he couldn't get to him
[1:20:26] in in in the realm of flesh but he had
[1:20:28] to step into another realm that's right
[1:20:30] and notice what he done is when he
[1:20:31] stepped over into that realm of Faith he
[1:20:34] walked out and sometimes even when you
[1:20:36] make that step and and you and you start
[1:20:38] you start that that Journey when he
[1:20:40] stepped out after a little bit his faith
[1:20:43] got went down he got over the the waves
[1:20:45] and things kind of overtook him and the
[1:20:47] Bible says he began to sink but
[1:20:49] immediately Jesus reached out and took a
[1:20:51] hold of him said see he wouldn't even
[1:20:53] let him he wouldn't invite him out there
[1:20:55] to drown he wouldn't invite him out
[1:20:57] there to let him sink in the water but
[1:20:59] it was his invitation that he walked
[1:21:01] into that realm of Faith so he's not
[1:21:02] going to let him get all wrapped up in
[1:21:04] it and not know where to go or or or not
[1:21:07] know what to do with it but he took a
[1:21:08] hold of him and he established his feet
[1:21:10] firm on the water and the Bible says
[1:21:13] that then he they went back to the boat
[1:21:15] isn't it something they walked back I
[1:21:17] thought my that isn't it something that
[1:21:19] whenever Jesus took him I don't believe
[1:21:21] that Jesus dragged him back to the boat
[1:21:23] I don't think that he took him and he
[1:21:25] carried him and he picked him up and had
[1:21:26] to drag him back to the boat but he was
[1:21:28] just holding on to him and but David
[1:21:30] whenever he was there in the presence of
[1:21:32] Jesus it gave him the faith to be able
[1:21:34] to stand on the water the very thing
[1:21:36] that was meant to drown him now he was
[1:21:38] standing on it the very thing that was
[1:21:40] going to take him down now he was
[1:21:42] standing on him because Jesus had got a
[1:21:44] hold of him and it gave him the faith to
[1:21:46] walk on the very thing that would have
[1:21:48] drowned him friends don't you realize
[1:21:50] that's what's wrong with the world today
[1:21:51] the world is a drowning people we're
[1:21:53] drowning in in sorrow they drown in debt
[1:21:56] they're drowning in grief they're
[1:21:57] drowning in the things of the world
[1:21:59] they're drowning in lay all to see you
[1:22:01] but I invite you this morning to step
[1:22:03] out into a realm of faith and forget
[1:22:05] about the old flesh for a little bit and
[1:22:07] step into a realm where Jesus can take a
[1:22:09] hold of you and allow the supernatural
[1:22:12] God to move in your life come on brother
[1:22:15] a realm of Faith you can't walk by flesh
[1:22:19] a Christian can't walk by flesh but they
[1:22:21] have to walk by the spirit
[1:22:23] Amen brother I walk in a walk by the
[1:22:26] flesh people go to church they judge
[1:22:27] every every service by their flesh they
[1:22:29] judge a move of God by their flesh by by
[1:22:32] their thinking or or their feelings It's
[1:22:33] Always by the flesh but forget about the
[1:22:35] flesh for a little bit and step out into
[1:22:37] a realm of faith and let God deal with
[1:22:40] your heart he won't leave you there
[1:22:43] Bible says we don't walk by flesh by the
[1:22:45] spirit listen what Paul says he said now
[1:22:47] there is no condemnation to them that
[1:22:49] are in Christ Jesus no condemnation can
[1:22:52] I can I sto right here just a minute
[1:22:54] took me a while to get here I'm sorry no
[1:22:56] condemnation you know what condemnation
[1:22:58] is it's an expression of strong
[1:23:00] disapproval it means that to pronounce
[1:23:03] something as wrong or morally culpable
[1:23:06] to disapprove of oneself isn't that the
[1:23:09] devil oh yeah condemnation That's what
[1:23:11] Satan does he brings a strong
[1:23:13] disapproval yeah so when you look at
[1:23:15] yourself you're always you're never
[1:23:17] going to be approved of you yeah it's a
[1:23:20] strong disapproval you're never meet the
[1:23:23] standard that you would set here's how I
[1:23:25] got to live here's how here's how I got
[1:23:27] to be a Christian in order to go to
[1:23:29] heaven in order to make a Rapture I got
[1:23:31] the all I got to meet all these
[1:23:32] standards and you'll never meet the
[1:23:34] standards that you set friends I'm here
[1:23:36] to tell you it don't matter what
[1:23:37] standard you set you're never going to
[1:23:39] meet every
[1:23:40] standard because we're flesh but Paul
[1:23:43] says see it it's a strong disapproval
[1:23:47] but then Paul says but no now there's no
[1:23:49] condemnation in other words there's no
[1:23:51] more dis approval isn't that good
[1:23:54] there's no more disapproval of yourself
[1:23:57] we know we can't approve of us because
[1:23:59] of who we are we can't approve of us
[1:24:01] because you know every thought you think
[1:24:02] you can't approve of you because you
[1:24:04] know everything you've done even when
[1:24:05] nobody else knows you can't approve of
[1:24:07] you but Paul said there's a place you
[1:24:09] can get that there's no more disapproval
[1:24:12] of you is that something there's no more
[1:24:14] condemnation to them that are in Christ
[1:24:17] Jesus you said well brother Matt I I
[1:24:19] don't know about you I can't put myself
[1:24:21] there you know why because we we we look
[1:24:23] at oursel I got news for you I can't put
[1:24:25] myself there either but you know what
[1:24:27] the Bible says we ain't got to because
[1:24:29] we were put there by by God that's what
[1:24:31] Paul said in 2 Corinthians 1 he said we
[1:24:33] was established in him not by our own
[1:24:35] self he said but he speaking of God
[1:24:38] which established us with you in Christ
[1:24:41] has anointed us is God so it wasn't us
[1:24:44] that put us there anyway it was God that
[1:24:47] put you there you may not be able to put
[1:24:49] yourself in Christ but it was God that
[1:24:51] put you there see it matter matters how
[1:24:52] you got there it was God somebody say
[1:24:54] that with me this morning God has
[1:24:56] established us in Christ it was God that
[1:25:00] has established us in Christ it ain't
[1:25:02] you that put you there see you can't you
[1:25:04] can't ever bring yourself there where
[1:25:05] there's no condemnation but Paul said
[1:25:07] but God has established us in Christ it
[1:25:10] was God that put you there it was God
[1:25:13] that thought that about you it was God
[1:25:14] that raised you to this place said well
[1:25:17] what does it mean to be in Christ well
[1:25:18] first you have to know who Christ is the
[1:25:20] Bible said he's a faithful and a true
[1:25:22] Witness so I got can I can I preach this
[1:25:23] to a little bit brother Ben brother Ben
[1:25:26] can you get thank you brother Ben he's
[1:25:27] my guy gives me a little time he's a
[1:25:29] faithful and true witness who who is
[1:25:31] Christ to be in Christ you have to know
[1:25:33] who he is he's a Creator how many how
[1:25:35] many knows that he's the he's the
[1:25:36] perfect realization of God he was the
[1:25:38] aen of God he was Jesus the son of God
[1:25:41] he Jesus said he was the beginning of
[1:25:43] the creation of God that's what the Lord
[1:25:45] said he was amen the beginning of the
[1:25:47] creation of God who is Christ that we
[1:25:49] could be in Christ he's the beginning of
[1:25:51] the creation you realize when most
[1:25:53] people read this brother Brown takes
[1:25:54] this in the church age book and he says
[1:25:57] you know people this is so easily
[1:25:59] misunderstood that he is the beginning
[1:26:01] of the creation of God this is
[1:26:03] misunderstood he said but those words
[1:26:05] because those words don't mean exactly
[1:26:07] as they sound to us I want you to catch
[1:26:10] this but he said because just taking
[1:26:12] them the way they sound has made some
[1:26:14] people in fact multitudes of people get
[1:26:16] the idea that Jesus was the first
[1:26:18] creation of God making him lower than
[1:26:20] the godhead see in other words that God
[1:26:23] created him and when God created him
[1:26:26] well then he was a lesser creation of
[1:26:28] God and then and then everything was
[1:26:29] created from him he said then this first
[1:26:31] creation created all the rest of the
[1:26:32] universe and whatever it contains but
[1:26:34] that is not right it don't line up with
[1:26:36] the rest of the Bible the words are he
[1:26:38] is the beginner or the author of the
[1:26:41] creation of God now we know for assurity
[1:26:43] that Jesus is God how many say Amen he's
[1:26:46] the very God he is the creator John 1
[1:26:48] and3 all things were made by him and
[1:26:50] without him was not anything made that
[1:26:51] was made he is the one of whom it was
[1:26:53] said in Genesis 1 in the beginning God
[1:26:56] created the Heaven and the Earth he was
[1:26:58] talking about
[1:27:00] Jesus It also says in Exodus the 20th
[1:27:02] chapter in six days the Lord made the
[1:27:05] Heaven and the earth and the Sea and all
[1:27:06] them is and rest and all that them is in
[1:27:09] them is and he rested on the seventh day
[1:27:12] he said see there is no doubt that he is
[1:27:15] the creator he was the creator of a
[1:27:18] finished physical creation he said
[1:27:21] surely we can see what these words mean
[1:27:23] now they cannot to have any other
[1:27:25] interpretation would mean that God
[1:27:27] created God he said see and how could
[1:27:30] God be how could God be created when he
[1:27:33] himself is the creator say so God
[1:27:35] couldn't created God now let me tell you
[1:27:37] where this confusion comes from because
[1:27:39] people have taken the scriptures and
[1:27:41] even even brother Bram preached it in
[1:27:42] question answers on Genesis they take
[1:27:44] the scripture of John 1 and one and say
[1:27:47] in the beginning was was the word and
[1:27:49] the Word was with God and the Word was
[1:27:50] God how many knows that word it was the
[1:27:51] L of God and but M takes that and and he
[1:27:54] talks about how that this logos of God
[1:27:57] how it came forth and it came from God
[1:27:58] and it spun off from God it was that
[1:28:00] life that came out and and and it
[1:28:02] created all that there ever was but
[1:28:05] without the church age book You' never
[1:28:06] be able to make this connection you
[1:28:08] would take that and you would you would
[1:28:10] prove every Baptist right and say that
[1:28:12] there was that there was a Lesser God
[1:28:13] and that Lesser God is what created in
[1:28:15] other words in heaven was God the Father
[1:28:18] it was God the son it was the Holy Ghost
[1:28:20] and there were three different ones on
[1:28:22] and then God made the other one and see
[1:28:24] You'd follow the same theology but when
[1:28:26] he goes in this church age book he
[1:28:28] actually makes this where it makes sense
[1:28:30] it shows us that that God was in heaven
[1:28:32] he was only one God but he was the
[1:28:34] Elohim God he was God of many attributes
[1:28:37] and so whenever God created him in the
[1:28:39] beginning and he said let there be and
[1:28:41] he made this logos for this word he said
[1:28:43] in the beginning was the word remember
[1:28:44] when brother M goes through this I I
[1:28:46] hate to go through this fast can I just
[1:28:48] take a minute when he goes through this
[1:28:50] and question answers on Genesis he
[1:28:52] reminds people to go back before the
[1:28:54] beginning this was the purpose of that
[1:28:56] he said he said in the beginning was the
[1:28:58] word in the beginning was the logos in
[1:29:00] the in the beginning it was God it was
[1:29:02] with God and it was God he said but what
[1:29:04] about before the beginning remember he
[1:29:06] goes back into the beginning he said
[1:29:08] there was this great Fountain of Life it
[1:29:09] was God he it was an eternal God he said
[1:29:12] but notice so whenever God the Father
[1:29:14] whenever he creates this and when it
[1:29:17] when he made the office of sunship
[1:29:20] that's why brother Brandon would preach
[1:29:21] that and say we don't believe in Eternal
[1:29:23] sunship see the church world today
[1:29:25] believes that that there's an eternal
[1:29:27] sunship in other words Jesus the the son
[1:29:30] the office of the sun was there all
[1:29:31] along but said but that's not what it
[1:29:33] was the sunship was an office of God so
[1:29:36] when he created it wasn't it wasn't it
[1:29:39] wasn't that he was making another
[1:29:41] another God but it was an office for the
[1:29:43] same God to be able to be present in and
[1:29:45] so when he made this logos and he
[1:29:47] created it it was the very same God Of
[1:29:49] Heaven that walked down in it and he
[1:29:51] Poss possessed it so it was the same
[1:29:53] Creator that's why he would say it was
[1:29:54] Jesus that made all things the Bible you
[1:29:57] go through the whole scripture you'll
[1:29:58] find it the same way Hebrews the first
[1:30:00] chapter Paul said God as sunry times and
[1:30:03] diverse manner spoke to the spoke to us
[1:30:05] unto the fathers by the prophets he said
[1:30:07] in the last days he spoke to us by his
[1:30:09] son whom he ha appointed heir of All
[1:30:11] Things by whom he also made the
[1:30:15] worlds he said he being in the
[1:30:17] brightness of his glory being the
[1:30:19] brightness of his glory the very
[1:30:21] brightness of the image of God the
[1:30:23] express image of his person in other
[1:30:25] words you wouldn't even be able to see
[1:30:26] God but you see him in that office he
[1:30:29] said upholding the things all things by
[1:30:32] the word of his power talking about
[1:30:34] Jesus who when he had by himself purged
[1:30:37] our sins he sat down on the right hand
[1:30:39] of God think about it into the Throne of
[1:30:41] God now Colossians 1 he said he
[1:30:44] delivered us from the power of Darkness
[1:30:46] he translated us into the kingdom of his
[1:30:47] dear son in whom we have Redemption
[1:30:49] through his blood even the Forgiveness
[1:30:51] of sins he was the image of the
[1:30:53] invisible God the very thing you
[1:30:55] couldn't see God created an office that
[1:30:56] you could see said see he was amaz he
[1:30:59] was the first born of every creature and
[1:31:01] by him were all things created and by
[1:31:03] him everything that was in heaven
[1:31:05] everything that was on Earth visible and
[1:31:06] invisible whether they be Thrones
[1:31:08] domensions principalities or Powers all
[1:31:10] things were created by Him and for him
[1:31:12] and he is before all things and by him
[1:31:15] all things consist so it wasn't a Lesser
[1:31:18] God that he made it was it was it was an
[1:31:20] office of God see the sunship it was an
[1:31:23] office that God had made for God to be
[1:31:24] able to dwell in and and and so we see
[1:31:27] him in the age in in the Le oysan Church
[1:31:29] the Bible says he is standing in the
[1:31:30] midst of the church this is what brother
[1:31:32] mam says about this he said now when
[1:31:33] he's standing there he's standing he
[1:31:36] stands there revealing who he is in this
[1:31:38] last age this is important to be in
[1:31:40] Christ you have to know who Christ is he
[1:31:43] said he's standing there revealing who
[1:31:45] he is in this last age he calls himself
[1:31:48] the author of the creation of God said
[1:31:51] see this is another creation this has to
[1:31:54] do with the church it's a special
[1:31:55] designation of himself he is the creator
[1:31:58] of that church the Heavenly bridegroom
[1:32:01] created his own bride and as the spirit
[1:32:03] of God he came down and he created in
[1:32:06] the Virgin Mary the cells from which his
[1:32:08] body was born he said I want to repeat
[1:32:10] that he created the very cells in the
[1:32:12] womb of Mary for that body it was not
[1:32:14] enough for the Holy Spirit to give life
[1:32:16] to a human ovam supplied by Mary that
[1:32:19] would have been sinful mankind producing
[1:32:21] a body he said that would it it would
[1:32:23] not have produced The Last adom of whom
[1:32:26] it was said that low a body hast thou
[1:32:28] the father prepared for me for the Bible
[1:32:30] said the father had prepared the body he
[1:32:33] says so it had to be God God not Mary
[1:32:35] provided the body Mary was a human
[1:32:37] incubator and she carried that holy
[1:32:39] child and brought him to birth it was a
[1:32:42] God man he was the son of God he was of
[1:32:45] the new creation he was man and God met
[1:32:48] and joined he was the first of this new
[1:32:51] race he was the head of the new race he
[1:32:54] quotes several scriptures Colossians
[1:32:55] 1:18 he is the head of the body the
[1:32:57] church who is the beginning the
[1:32:59] firstborn of the dead and all things
[1:33:01] that he might have preeminence 2
[1:33:02] Corinthians 5 he said therefore If any
[1:33:04] man be in Christ he is a new creation
[1:33:07] old things are passed away behold all
[1:33:10] things are come new amen he said there
[1:33:12] you see it couldn't be the old order of
[1:33:15] creation but it had to be a new now in
[1:33:18] Union with Christ he has become a new
[1:33:21] creation of God Amen he's talking about
[1:33:23] our relationship with God Ephesians 2 he
[1:33:25] said we are his workmanship created in
[1:33:28] Christ Jesus he said see it's a new
[1:33:30] creation we're created in Christ God
[1:33:32] made a new creation he said see we're
[1:33:35] created in Christ Jesus unto good works
[1:33:37] brother said in other words we were
[1:33:38] created in Union with Christ unto good
[1:33:41] works Ephesians 4:24 Paul said and you
[1:33:44] put on the new man which after God is
[1:33:48] created in righteousness and true
[1:33:50] Holiness so there's a new creation say
[1:33:53] how can you not how can you walk in the
[1:33:55] spirit and and not in this flesh but
[1:33:57] Paul he's showing us there's a new
[1:33:58] creation that God has made but remember
[1:34:00] said see this new creation it's not the
[1:34:02] old creation made over that's where
[1:34:04] people get it messed up that God has
[1:34:06] come and he's kind of fixed up your life
[1:34:08] and and and and made you made you a
[1:34:10] better person and kind of menend you
[1:34:11] that way he said but it ain't the old
[1:34:13] creation made over it can never be
[1:34:15] called a new creation that's exactly
[1:34:17] what the Bible said it's a new creation
[1:34:19] he said see it's another creation that's
[1:34:21] distinct from the old one no longer is
[1:34:24] he dealing with the ways of the flesh
[1:34:26] that he dealt with that's how he dealt
[1:34:27] with Israel he chose Abraham and
[1:34:29] Abraham's issue through Isaac or the
[1:34:32] lineage of Isaac he said but now out of
[1:34:34] the Kindred of every tribe and every
[1:34:37] nation God has purposed a new creation
[1:34:40] it ain't out of the lineage of Flesh of
[1:34:41] Abraham or or or or the F or the or the
[1:34:44] or Abraham's son he said but it's a new
[1:34:46] creation out of every nation in the
[1:34:48] world God has made a new creation and
[1:34:51] Jesus Jesus he's the first of that
[1:34:52] creation he was God created in the form
[1:34:55] of man that makes me want to Shadow over
[1:34:56] this building he was God created in the
[1:34:59] form of man and now by his Spirit he is
[1:35:02] creating many sons unto himself God the
[1:35:06] Creator creating himself a part of his
[1:35:08] creation but said this is the true
[1:35:11] revelation of God it's the true
[1:35:14] Revelation this was his purpose this
[1:35:17] purpose this purpose took form through
[1:35:20] election said see that is why God could
[1:35:22] look down at the last stage and all he
[1:35:25] would see all that would be over he
[1:35:26] would see himself in the middle of the
[1:35:28] church as the author of the new creation
[1:35:29] of God because by his own decree he
[1:35:32] elected members of this new creation
[1:35:34] Listen Now by God's decree he could see
[1:35:38] himself standing in the midst of the
[1:35:39] church and people worshiping him and
[1:35:41] being a part of that creation he said
[1:35:43] because he his Sovereign power is what
[1:35:46] brought it to pass his own decree
[1:35:48] elected members of this new creation he
[1:35:51] predestinated them to the adoption of
[1:35:53] children according to the good pleasure
[1:35:55] of his will and by his omnipotence he
[1:35:57] brought it to pass how else could he
[1:35:59] know he would be standing in the midst
[1:36:00] of the church receiving Glory from his
[1:36:01] Brethren if he didn't make sure that it
[1:36:03] would happen it was God by his own
[1:36:06] decree he made a new creation in his own
[1:36:09] plan he saw you in his mind it a it
[1:36:11] ain't the old order of creation where we
[1:36:13] were laying in the midst of the Flesh
[1:36:15] and the FI of the things of the flesh he
[1:36:17] said but God made something new that
[1:36:20] would be able to all all things he knew
[1:36:22] he said all things worked out according
[1:36:24] to what he knew in order that his
[1:36:25] purpose and his good pleasure might be
[1:36:27] brought to pass am he said aren't you
[1:36:30] glad that you belong to him he made you
[1:36:33] a new creation are you hearing me
[1:36:36] somebody you see why that old flesh
[1:36:37] don't have nothing to do with it he said
[1:36:39] he made you a new creation he ain't
[1:36:41] mending up the old broken thing he made
[1:36:43] you a new creation it was a and Jesus
[1:36:45] was the firstborn among many brethren we
[1:36:49] walk not after the flesh but after the
[1:36:51] spirit spirit amen he made you this
[1:36:53] church it isn't a it isn't a church the
[1:36:55] whole church world's done everything
[1:36:56] based on emotions in the flesh but
[1:36:58] there's a new creation that God has made
[1:37:01] the Bible says you are Christ you say
[1:37:03] how are we a new creation we're a new
[1:37:06] race think about it don't that make you
[1:37:08] want to shout a new creation a new race
[1:37:11] of people a super class of people not oh
[1:37:14] if you can ever get your revelation of
[1:37:16] it this morning you ain't you ain't you
[1:37:17] ain't of the lineage of your natural
[1:37:19] father you're a new creation in God
[1:37:22] the very the very sovereignty of God is
[1:37:24] dwelling on the inside of every believer
[1:37:26] the that's what God's waiting he's
[1:37:28] waiting on you to come to this place
[1:37:29] that's why the Bible says the whole
[1:37:30] earth is groaning and waiting on the
[1:37:32] manifestation of the sons of God waiting
[1:37:35] for you to come to your position in
[1:37:36] Christ you're a new creation you're made
[1:37:39] by God the Bible says you are Christ but
[1:37:43] tell you got my picture you are Christ
[1:37:46] you're ready to go I know I I ain't got
[1:37:49] a I ain't got a longwinded spirit on me
[1:37:50] but let let me just get this he said you
[1:37:53] are
[1:37:54] Christ you are Christ I haven't preached
[1:37:56] in 10
[1:37:58] days you are Christ and everybody got an
[1:38:02] extra hour of sleep last night did I do
[1:38:05] that
[1:38:07] backwards man you are Christ I seen this
[1:38:12] one brother her brother told me he said
[1:38:14] there was this thing online last night
[1:38:15] it said it said be sure to put your
[1:38:19] clocks up an hour or you'll be an hour
[1:38:20] and 10 man late for church in the
[1:38:23] morning
[1:38:25] like make sure you put it up an hour you
[1:38:29] going be an hour and a half late Glory
[1:38:31] oh Lord help us you are Christ you are
[1:38:34] Christ that's a scripture 1 Corinthians
[1:38:36] 3 how many how many's heard that
[1:38:38] scripture I want to read it from the
[1:38:40] Bible the Bible says and you are Christ
[1:38:42] and Christ is God's in other words you
[1:38:44] belong to him you belong how many
[1:38:47] believe that you belong to him but see
[1:38:49] there's something greater laying in this
[1:38:51] brother bram's talking about this in the
[1:38:52] church age book there's something
[1:38:53] greater than you just belonging to God
[1:38:56] see I want you to notice in this
[1:38:57] scripture it says and you are Christ
[1:38:59] right there there's apostrophe between
[1:39:01] the T and the s that apostrophe declares
[1:39:04] ownership it means that you belong to
[1:39:06] God you you're his possession but let me
[1:39:08] show you something a little bit even
[1:39:10] greater than that can you put my picture
[1:39:11] back up no it's the picture it wasn't a
[1:39:13] typo but it says you are Christ but the
[1:39:16] apostrophe getting there now you can
[1:39:18] find this word in the Bible too Christ
[1:39:20] without the the apostrophe is talking
[1:39:22] about something totally different Jesus
[1:39:23] uses this in Matthew the 24th chapter he
[1:39:25] said there shall arise many false
[1:39:27] christs in other words they were plural
[1:39:29] of Christ Jesus said it wasn't that
[1:39:31] there was false jesuses that are running
[1:39:33] around the world he said but it was
[1:39:35] false anointed ones that in the end time
[1:39:39] but notice but he didn't just leave it
[1:39:40] there that there's just false anointed
[1:39:41] ones he said but there if there's false
[1:39:43] anointed ones then there must be true
[1:39:45] anointed ones if there's a false
[1:39:48] anointed if there's false Christ then
[1:39:50] there must be true true Christ there
[1:39:51] must there must be the true anointed
[1:39:53] ones it must be a true anointing it is
[1:39:55] Christ in his church he said it's the
[1:39:57] very fullness of God in his church today
[1:40:00] he was the first born among many
[1:40:02] Brethren it was a new creation of God
[1:40:04] but ra said and in there there would be
[1:40:06] a Time come forth when he could express
[1:40:08] himself in the fullness of his godhead
[1:40:11] deity through his church having the
[1:40:14] preeminence in the church he said oh my
[1:40:16] what what about it the anointed man has
[1:40:19] now become the anointed people that that
[1:40:21] man that was anointed that man named
[1:40:23] Jesus that you could look upon and say
[1:40:26] he was anointed man butam said but now
[1:40:28] the anointed man has became an anointed
[1:40:30] people he said oh my to bring back the
[1:40:33] anointed bride the bridegroom anointed
[1:40:35] he said how are they anointed by
[1:40:36] accepting what Eve turned down and Adam
[1:40:39] coming back with the anointing of the
[1:40:41] word of God he said my word is a spirit
[1:40:43] he was anointed with a word and the very
[1:40:45] thing that Eve turned down it has came
[1:40:47] back in this hour and we have accepted
[1:40:50] it you you are Christ you've accepted
[1:40:53] the anointing of God he said you're a
[1:40:55] messiah that's what the Bible said that
[1:40:57] he was the Messiah but you're little
[1:40:59] Messiah that are in the world with the
[1:41:01] same very the very same God that was in
[1:41:04] Jesus Christ that is in you today it's
[1:41:06] you in Christ and Christ in
[1:41:08] you your Messiah so what are you
[1:41:11] anointed for to do the same work that
[1:41:13] God done the very Redemptive work that
[1:41:15] was in the Bible that we're still doing
[1:41:17] in this hour I'm just now getting to my
[1:41:18] message the Holy Ghost in Christ has
[1:41:21] been reconciled by to the world today
[1:41:24] Paul said see if any man be in Christ
[1:41:26] he's a new creature old things are
[1:41:28] passed away and All Things become new
[1:41:31] and all things are of God now of those
[1:41:34] that have been reconciled us unto
[1:41:36] himself by Jesus Christ and has given us
[1:41:39] the ministry of reconciliation not only
[1:41:41] that we are Christ and not only did he
[1:41:44] make us a new creation not only did he
[1:41:46] do all that for for me not only do I
[1:41:49] belong to him not only did he feel F me
[1:41:51] with his Spirit but Paul said now that
[1:41:53] same Christ that was ministering to me
[1:41:55] is now ministering through me he said
[1:41:57] God that was in Christ reconciling the
[1:42:00] world to himself not imputing trespasses
[1:42:02] unto them but has committed unto us the
[1:42:05] word of reconciliation and now then we
[1:42:08] are ambassadors for Christ as though God
[1:42:12] did beseech You by us and we pray for
[1:42:15] you in Christ stead that you would be
[1:42:18] reconciled to God I don't know about
[1:42:20] y'all but that's sets my soul on fire he
[1:42:22] said I pray for you in Christ said when
[1:42:25] Jesus ain't here walking on the earth to
[1:42:27] pray for you Jesus ain't walking on the
[1:42:29] earth to lift you up Jesus ain't walking
[1:42:31] on the earth to get a hold of you and
[1:42:33] and to walk you through every aspect of
[1:42:35] your life he said but it's Christ in you
[1:42:37] and Christ in me that is speaking
[1:42:39] through me and in Christ said I pray for
[1:42:41] you oh friends don't you realize the
[1:42:43] same thing that Jesus done that you had
[1:42:45] the power to do it's in the body it was
[1:42:48] what was in the head has been poured out
[1:42:50] into the body of Jesus Christ and you
[1:42:52] are
[1:42:53] Christ my sad this bride church is
[1:42:57] continuing the works that Jesus done
[1:43:00] that's what Jesus said anyway it's the
[1:43:01] Bible Jesus said the works that I do
[1:43:03] shall you do
[1:43:05] also I'm say it wasn't another work he
[1:43:07] said God wants to bring the Holy Ghost
[1:43:09] in you to continue the same work that he
[1:43:12] was doing in Christ you are
[1:43:14] Christ see we're living in a time
[1:43:16] brother Adam that it's necessary for him
[1:43:18] to do it amen we're living in a Time
[1:43:21] that we need it where I don't believe
[1:43:22] that God would give you something that
[1:43:24] you didn't need that's right a't that
[1:43:26] true I'm going to I'm I'm going to wrap
[1:43:27] this up I don't believe God I want
[1:43:29] believe God would give you something
[1:43:30] that you didn't need but say see the
[1:43:32] work wasn't so needy in the days of
[1:43:34] Luther yeah isn't that good it wasn't so
[1:43:38] needy then that was that was God's
[1:43:40] church it was a little bit more needier
[1:43:43] in the days of Wesley because the world
[1:43:46] the Bible says the world get weaker and
[1:43:47] weaker and wiser and more wicked all the
[1:43:49] time see see but the Holy Spirit has
[1:43:52] been moving he said there was just a
[1:43:53] little breath of it in Luther a little
[1:43:55] blow of it in Wesley and a deeper blow
[1:43:57] of it in Pentecost but now the breath
[1:43:59] and the spirit has come the same she's
[1:44:02] uniting together bringing forth the same
[1:44:05] powerful blow of the Holy Ghost like it
[1:44:07] did back there and it's manifesting the
[1:44:09] same works that he did back there is
[1:44:12] being manifested right today the very
[1:44:14] same thing say what was it that was that
[1:44:17] was ministering in our day brother
[1:44:19] Wesley it was the it was the spirit and
[1:44:21] the Breath of God uniting together to
[1:44:23] manifest the same Works isn't it
[1:44:25] something it was Christ in a human being
[1:44:28] in the Breath of God speaking out of him
[1:44:30] and the spirit of God living in him and
[1:44:31] ministering doing the same works that
[1:44:33] God does what is it in you today the the
[1:44:36] very Church of God it's the spirit and
[1:44:38] the Breath of God uniting together
[1:44:40] ministering The Works of God the same
[1:44:42] works that God done are being done in
[1:44:44] The Bride of Jesus Christ the breath and
[1:44:46] the spirit coming together Jesus said
[1:44:48] verily I say unto you the son can do
[1:44:50] nothing unless you see the father doing
[1:44:51] it whatever the father does he shows the
[1:44:53] son the father dwelleth in me and he's
[1:44:55] the one that does the works isn't it
[1:44:57] something something in you you see but
[1:45:00] we're living in a needy hour we're
[1:45:02] living in a time of great need and you
[1:45:04] realize that the life Oh Glory to God
[1:45:07] you realize the life that is in the
[1:45:08] church it it manifests What It Is by
[1:45:11] what it desires by the needs of it you
[1:45:14] take a little mama that's pregnant you
[1:45:16] may you may not know that you may not
[1:45:18] know it for a little while maybe she can
[1:45:19] go to the doctor whatever but but she
[1:45:21] starts craving different things what is
[1:45:24] it but something that you wouldn't need
[1:45:25] I know you some of y'all laugh about the
[1:45:28] things that people eat all all kinds of
[1:45:29] funny stories that that that I've heard
[1:45:31] some of the goofiest stuff people get
[1:45:33] they'll get pickles and and and and
[1:45:35] barbecue chips and ice cream and mix
[1:45:37] them all together in a bowl and eat
[1:45:38] that's the weirdest stuff that people
[1:45:40] eat and and why why why would you eat
[1:45:42] that you never like that con am I am I
[1:45:44] talking out of my head is that not the
[1:45:46] truth they always eat weird things why
[1:45:48] why they eat weird things because
[1:45:49] there's a life in her her that has a
[1:45:51] need of something and the life that is
[1:45:54] in her although she ain't it ain't it
[1:45:56] ain't talking to her but it but it but
[1:45:58] it but it's pulling a need it's it has a
[1:46:01] desire for something and so and so now
[1:46:03] as this mama begins to speak and and she
[1:46:06] gets this desire she don't even know
[1:46:07] where it came from but she begins to
[1:46:09] speak and she says you know honey if you
[1:46:11] can go by the store maybe grab pack get
[1:46:13] a big old jar them kosher deal pickles
[1:46:16] and and uh and and some some apricot ice
[1:46:19] cream and in a in a case of Dr Pepper
[1:46:22] he's like what in the world you want
[1:46:24] with all that stuff but you know what
[1:46:25] because there's something on there's a
[1:46:27] life in her that needs something it's
[1:46:28] like the little boy that would tells a
[1:46:30] story about him chewing on the bicycle
[1:46:31] pedal he said why was he chewing on the
[1:46:33] pedal because there was something in his
[1:46:34] first bird that wasn't put there the
[1:46:36] nutrients and the things that that
[1:46:38] wasn't in his body and so he would chew
[1:46:39] on it to get that out of it to fulfill
[1:46:41] what he had need of in his life say so
[1:46:44] this is where we are and and that that
[1:46:46] because there's a desire there and you
[1:46:47] know what a good daddy will do he'll go
[1:46:49] down to the store he'll buy a case of Dr
[1:46:51] Pepper he'll get apricot ice cream he'll
[1:46:53] get a big jar of kosher deer pickles
[1:46:55] he'll hold his nose the whole way home
[1:46:57] he'll give it to her and say you mix it
[1:46:58] up on your own I don't want to have
[1:47:00] nothing to do with but he'll make sure
[1:47:01] that she has what she has need of
[1:47:03] because he wants a perfect child and he
[1:47:05] knows that there's something in there
[1:47:07] there's a life in there that's calling
[1:47:09] out for whatever's in that pickle
[1:47:10] there's a life in there that's calling
[1:47:12] out for whatever's in apricot ice cream
[1:47:14] there's a a life in there that that's
[1:47:15] calling out for whatever's in that Dr
[1:47:17] Pepper there's something in there that
[1:47:19] it needs and the daddy will do
[1:47:21] everything he can to make sure that it
[1:47:23] gets what it needs because he wants it
[1:47:25] to be born a perfect child but say
[1:47:28] that's the same way it is with the
[1:47:29] church today see God we're in a needy
[1:47:31] hour and the church has needs there's a
[1:47:34] life don't you see it this morning
[1:47:35] friends there's a life that is growing
[1:47:37] in the Church of the Living God and it
[1:47:39] it may seem strange to the world when
[1:47:41] you come preaching these things it may
[1:47:43] seem like a strange Doctrine to the
[1:47:45] Baptist or the Presbyterian or a church
[1:47:47] down the road it may seem like a strange
[1:47:49] Doctrine but it's the life that is in
[1:47:51] the church that has need of it cuz it's
[1:47:53] a it's a life that that is looking for
[1:47:56] Rapture he said Oh my he said a good
[1:47:58] daddy will do everything you can to get
[1:47:59] it he said but if that's that way with
[1:48:01] our Earthly father then what about our
[1:48:03] heavenly father the church has needs he
[1:48:05] said how much more abler is he to go get
[1:48:08] it he's a Creator now think about how
[1:48:12] able he is to prepare somebody to live
[1:48:14] like his own glorious body if we want to
[1:48:16] live there's something in us that calls
[1:48:19] us to live and there something in us
[1:48:21] that calls us to do right and then God
[1:48:23] will call somebody to the platform or
[1:48:25] the pull pit that'll preach the absolute
[1:48:27] truth he see what does that show you
[1:48:30] that if you're a real child of God
[1:48:31] you'll begin to cry out God take it from
[1:48:33] me circumcise me from it take these
[1:48:36] things away from me he said because it's
[1:48:38] needed for your heavenly home where
[1:48:40] you're going to for he's gone to prepare
[1:48:42] a place for you and you got to be the
[1:48:44] real word bride of Jesus Christ man is
[1:48:47] that something that God would send a
[1:48:49] preacher to the the platform that would
[1:48:51] go down glory to God that would go down
[1:48:53] to the store he'd go down to the store
[1:48:55] and in the very Spirit that's on the
[1:48:57] inside of you that begins to call out
[1:48:59] the things that you need from God and
[1:49:01] that'll that'll Inspire man of God to be
[1:49:03] digging in the word looking for
[1:49:05] something and God would inspire a
[1:49:07] scripture it's our heavenly father that
[1:49:09] brings the needs to the people that the
[1:49:11] life inside of them can manifest
[1:49:14] itself I believe that Amen brother I
[1:49:17] believe that he said he'll call somebody
[1:49:18] to the pull pit that'll preach the
[1:49:20] absolute truth you know you know what it
[1:49:22] is he said if he's preaching that it
[1:49:23] proves that there's life in the church
[1:49:25] glory to God it proves that there's
[1:49:27] something in there that's Desiring
[1:49:29] something it proves there's a lie if God
[1:49:31] would send an inspired word it proves
[1:49:33] there's life in you if God's ministering
[1:49:35] to you this morning it proves there's
[1:49:37] life in you and it's growing and it's
[1:49:39] reaching out it may seem strange but
[1:49:43] that's what's that's what you're feeding
[1:49:44] on you're feeding on something that your
[1:49:47] the life in your body needs you're
[1:49:49] feeding on something there's a there's a
[1:49:51] people we're not we're not like
[1:49:52] everybody else why this people this life
[1:49:54] in you is looking to Rapture this life
[1:49:57] in you it's looking for a body change
[1:49:59] you know what we do and we don't have to
[1:50:01] we don't go down to the headquarters to
[1:50:02] pick it up see that's what the whole
[1:50:04] churches do they go down the
[1:50:05] headquarters and pick up what do my
[1:50:07] church need I don't know here's the
[1:50:08] problem in the church and the bishop
[1:50:10] down there will give them what to say to
[1:50:11] their church this is what happened over
[1:50:12] here just give them that and that'll
[1:50:13] take care of them take them that little
[1:50:14] pamphlet we don't have a headquarters to
[1:50:16] go toen come on he said there's a life
[1:50:19] in there that needs something yeah God
[1:50:21] sent an Abel Minister that was to the
[1:50:23] platform that is inspired said but where
[1:50:25] would he get it we don't go to the
[1:50:27] headquarters he said I believe she's
[1:50:28] ready the final climax Yonder to bring
[1:50:31] forth a faith that will Rapture the
[1:50:32] church into glory and it's laying in the
[1:50:35] message the Lord so where will they go
[1:50:37] to get it out of the message of the hour
[1:50:39] that's why we dig into it and that's why
[1:50:41] we preach it and that's why these
[1:50:43] brothers that anointed to God come and
[1:50:44] preach this same message cuz the very
[1:50:46] thing you need for Rapture and faith and
[1:50:48] Rapture and Grace is laid in the the
[1:50:50] message of the hour we don't have a
[1:50:51] headquarters to get it from but I thank
[1:50:53] God there's still men of God that'll go
[1:50:55] back to the message of God and pull out
[1:50:58] what the church has need of today and
[1:51:00] feed God's children why he's the Creator
[1:51:03] I'm going to close with this point that
[1:51:05] he's the Creator said to bring forth
[1:51:08] it's laying in the message you realize
[1:51:10] that what was laying there what's there
[1:51:13] was laying there before you needed it
[1:51:15] right amen isn't that something Lord
[1:51:17] everything you ever have need of was
[1:51:19] laying there before you needed that's
[1:51:21] right and God would reach down into the
[1:51:23] word of God and pull out the very needs
[1:51:25] of the church the body of Christ think
[1:51:29] about it it was already there amen you
[1:51:31] know the Bible tells us a story in John
[1:51:34] the 9th chapter Bible says Jesus Came
[1:51:37] Upon A man that had been blind from his
[1:51:40] birth you remember the story and the man
[1:51:43] asked Jesus when he came by they said
[1:51:45] what did this man do to cause him to be
[1:51:47] born blind what caused this and Jesus
[1:51:50] said it wasn't no sins of his or sins of
[1:51:53] his father or mother he said but it was
[1:51:55] only that the glory of God would be
[1:51:57] revealed in
[1:51:58] him a't it something here that creator
[1:52:01] of the David was standing there with him
[1:52:03] he was looking as some music players
[1:52:05] come he was looking for for answers I
[1:52:08] thought here he I've told I've used this
[1:52:10] many times and how they would heard him
[1:52:12] he heard the voice of Jesus begin to
[1:52:14] speak but you realize what he was really
[1:52:16] hearing he was hearing the voice of the
[1:52:19] creator
[1:52:21] the one that made every man the one that
[1:52:23] formed Adam out of a dust to the ground
[1:52:26] and he heard his voes he began to speak
[1:52:30] and Jesus as he turned to the man you
[1:52:32] remember what he told him the Bible says
[1:52:33] he went down on the dust and he took
[1:52:35] some dirt out of the ground and he and
[1:52:37] he made an eyeball out of it and then he
[1:52:39] put it in the man's sockets and he said
[1:52:41] go wash in the pool at salom and the
[1:52:43] Bible says the man he went down to the
[1:52:45] pool and he washed and he came back
[1:52:48] seeing
[1:52:50] my he met the
[1:52:53] Creator and he gave him something that
[1:52:55] he was
[1:52:56] missing but butam say see but listen
[1:52:59] this he said in the beginning he said we
[1:53:01] came from the dust of the earth our
[1:53:04] bodies laid in the Earth at the
[1:53:05] beginning he said let's take a little
[1:53:07] picture of this God the Fountain of Life
[1:53:09] the logos that went out of God he
[1:53:11] brooded over the Earth he was brooding
[1:53:13] the word which means mothering or cing
[1:53:15] over the Earth he brooded over it and
[1:53:18] everything that we are was laying in the
[1:53:20] earth he said my body was laid out on
[1:53:22] this Earth before there was even a life
[1:53:25] on the earth the calcium the petroleum
[1:53:28] God is a contractor and he laid out all
[1:53:31] the bodies like he was going to build a
[1:53:33] subdivision he know we'd be here he know
[1:53:36] I'd be here before the world he know I'd
[1:53:38] be standing here before before the world
[1:53:40] was here he know you'd be sitting in the
[1:53:41] seat you are he's infinite he knows it
[1:53:43] so what are you scared about I thought
[1:53:46] my is is something that God all these
[1:53:48] bodies everything that you are was
[1:53:50] laying in this earth and here God this
[1:53:53] great contractor before he would ever
[1:53:55] put it together as he would lay and he
[1:53:57] would brw over the Earth and he would
[1:53:58] look at all that we were I thought no
[1:54:01] wonder whenever Jesus came in contact
[1:54:03] with this blind man and they would ask
[1:54:05] what did he do to cause him to be born
[1:54:06] this way I thought here he was the
[1:54:08] Creator God that was tending before him
[1:54:10] that same creator that whenever that
[1:54:12] body was being formed in the womb of his
[1:54:14] mother let me tell you how much how much
[1:54:17] God had done this on purpose friends I
[1:54:19] don't believe I don't believe it's just
[1:54:20] a coincidence Jesus said that the glory
[1:54:22] of God might be revealed in him then it
[1:54:24] was B when his body was being formed and
[1:54:27] there and and and the little legs came
[1:54:28] on the body and the arms that that
[1:54:30] Creator God would say now hold off on
[1:54:32] the eyes just for a little while and
[1:54:35] that body was born into this Earth
[1:54:36] Without Eyes in his socket and he came
[1:54:39] in one day he came walking on the earth
[1:54:41] and he met that same Creator and notice
[1:54:43] what he said he said he didn't sin to
[1:54:45] cause himself to be born this way he
[1:54:47] said but it was that the glory of God
[1:54:49] might be revealed in him and then the
[1:54:51] Bible says notice where Jesus went to
[1:54:53] get his eyes he went down to the dust to
[1:54:55] the ground the very place where the
[1:54:57] Prophet said our bodies were laying
[1:54:58] there before the foundation of the world
[1:55:00] I thought my he picked up the eyes that
[1:55:03] had been laying there before the world
[1:55:04] was ever created and he P formed an
[1:55:07] eyeball and put it in his socket and he
[1:55:09] gave him some friends you may have been
[1:55:10] born in this world you may be missing
[1:55:12] some things you may feel like you're
[1:55:14] you're missing out on what God has made
[1:55:16] you in this new creation that he made
[1:55:18] but he's God the Creator and everything
[1:55:21] that he made for you is already here
[1:55:23] it's laying in the message of the hour
[1:55:25] and I thank God that he has send
[1:55:27] somebody would be able to pull it out
[1:55:29] and give it to you in the time of need
[1:55:32] you say why am I weak this morning it's
[1:55:34] that the glory of God might be revealed
[1:55:35] in you why am I go through depression
[1:55:37] that the glory of God might be revealed
[1:55:39] in you why don't I have the faith that I
[1:55:41] ought to have that the glory of God
[1:55:43] might be revealed in you that out of the
[1:55:45] message of the hour we can take an arm
[1:55:47] and put it where the arm needs to go out
[1:55:49] of the message of the hour you can take
[1:55:51] a a hand and put it where the hand needs
[1:55:53] to go out of the message of the hour
[1:55:55] take an eyeball and put it back in the
[1:55:57] ey socket where eye needs to
[1:55:59] go the Creator God is Among Us doing the
[1:56:03] same work don't you realize when he
[1:56:05] stood in this church he said didn't you
[1:56:07] know that leot Dean Church she was blind
[1:56:10] and wretched and miserable and naked why
[1:56:13] was she born blind that the glory of God
[1:56:17] might be revealed in her Amen in the the
[1:56:19] midst of that church isn't it something

[1:56:31] creation he's the Creator God Amen and
[1:56:34] put a church in the middle of Le O DEA
[1:56:36] when everything else is Fallen around

[1:56:40] that age isn't it something out of the
[1:56:42] filthiest of places come the most
[1:56:44] beautiful thing that God has ever made
