believe all things are possible amen you believe every promise that he's made can you sing it like this as we invite our brother to come Lord I [Music] receive Lord I receed all things are [Music] possible All Things Are are possible Lord [Music] ice man you believe that tonight that's more than a song that's real that he said if you could believe that all things was possible man we can say it and kind of intellectually sometimes we hear things so much that it becomes intellectual but when something begins to drop in our heart and begin to thinkk Lord you promised that in your word and tonight if we can believe I believe that anything's possible amen he can heal you you say well brother Dave I put up with what I've got for 40 years what tonight may be the night of Deliverance amen and not because I'm here or because the pastor's here but because Jesus Christ said where there's two or three gathered in my name I'll be in the midst of them amen and those are promises that he made and God's never let One Promise go man man I won't keep you standing but if we would uh if you would let's turn to Psalms the 29th chapter and the first verse and it's good to see so many out tonight on it it's an old winter night Psalms 29 And1 give unto the Lord oh ye Mighty give unto the Lord glory and strength give unto the Lord the glory do his name Worship the Lord in the beauty of his Holiness the voice of the Lord is upon the waters the god of Glory breth The Cedars yay the Lord breakthe of Lebanon amen we'll just stop there if you would let just bow our hearts a minute and precious Heavenly Father Lord we just we come in your presence tonight Lord and believe that you're here we can feel you Lord and knowing not just because we feel you but because you promised you'd be here and meet us you said if two or three was gathered in your name you'd be in the midst and Lord it's no cold winter night and I see your your children how it humbles me that they come out to hear the word of God and how important it is that Lord we enter in and just maybe just for a few minutes God you see my insufficiencies as a man and Lord you give me the ability to read so I might read something that was good or but Lord without the Holy Ghost to show up to Quicken the word Lord just so much that we could do but Lord I believe tonight that if one has a need you could speak to their heart however it might be God I pray that you'd do it help me to hum P myself down and just say what you'd have me to say Lord not what I want to say but what the Holy Spirit would have me say tonight and we be careful to give you the praise in Jesus name we ask it amen and amen you can be seated if you'd like man it's a such a privilege to come for a few minutes and look at some things and you know last time I preached here I had preached on a subject of the importance of a voice and I'd made it to a certain point i' talked and not to I'm not going to repr preach it so don't uh get scared but I was talking about for those that wouldn't here how that God promised he would speak through a prophet in the different ways and uh just I really had a good time preaching it and many people come up and had good things to say and said they enjoyed it but I wanted to go just a little bit further because I got to a stopping point and I stopped there and brother Matt got up and he didn't know it but he kind of got on the rest of my sermon he began to talk about the man that you know spoke for him down there on the plane that time and and U it's odd how you kind of catch but anyway I I I kind of want to start I don't I don't want to start over and start repeating myself on but I had read a quote here and I kind of if that's okay I'd like to start there because I think there's many here there wasn't a whole lot here here that night and there's many here that that uh is here tonight that wasn't in and uh I want to speak on them the importance of a voice that it's still important brother Wes that it's important for God to speak but you know what it's important what we say and do amen it's important that we have a voice and and even uh there was a quote I may mentioned it last time I said if I don't if I do I don't mean mean to repeat myself but brother Brandon was preaching and he said there was that I think was in on the phone line and he said you out there he said Say Amen to it he said that way people will know where you stand at amen so uh you know the man they talked about that was uh I believe he was deaf and dumb he went to church one time and they asked him they said how come that you come to church and you can't hear nothing and and you can't speak you can't do nothing but sit there and he said I just want Satan to know which side I'm on so sometimes it's good to start speaking up and let Satan know which side you're on Amen you know you can just get pushed so far in a corner my dad told me there was a man one time that he knew that told him he said that he hadd been going along and Satan started trying to talk to him and you know Satan's got a voice too he can talk amen I just uh take a few minutes and just preach you my heart you just say a prayer for me but anyway he he said that uh this man went along and Satan began to tell him that you know you're blasphemed and you can't get right with God and you did this and you did that and got him all nervous and worked up and got where he couldn't feel the presence of God no more and when he did he said one day he said he got tired of it amen that's where you got to get sometimes you got to get tired of what Satan's telling you in the lies and he's telling if he tells you you can't live right you can't do this you tell him by Jesus Christ he said that all things are possible amen I can do all things through Christ who strengthens me he said one day he got tired of Satan telling him that he said Satan he said I tell you what he said God May cast me out somewhere but he said while I'm here I'm going to live for him and he said all of a sudden he begin to feel the presence of God Amen he got so sick of what Satan was trying to tell him it be good sometimes for us to get sick of Satan telling us amen you can't have healing you can't have this and he begins to talk to you and tell you because you've done a certain thing that's the reason why you're sick and you'll never get rid of it amen that's a lie that's right Amen brother Bram I read a quote here while back brother Bram said even if you done something he said pray and say Lord if I did something to let this come on me you forgive me and I believe God we forgive you for it amen we serve a mighty God that's forgiving and amen his word is true tonight amen so anyway I kind of want talk a little bit about the voice that we have and the things that we say and do it pays to say and do the right things amen as brother Matt was talking that night about that man that that stood up on the plane and he said I know that man he said he was on the last flight and he began to speak up for him amen and even in the even in the congregation brother BR talked about how we ought to stick together you know tight you know and and uh if someone starts trying to inject a little something against somebody amen don't you listen to that amen even if it's true you pray for the person and and and go to them the Bible says if you have an odd against somebody you go to them man it didn't say get on the phone and call everybody you could and spread it around amen but you know sometimes even just in the natural you just uh to speak up for somebody I've seen it I've seen it both ways I've seen someone tell something on somebody and it might not even be true and another person take it and begin to spread that a little bit and tell someone else and pretty soon it becomes so negative everybody kind of gets down on the person amen but I've seen it the other way when somebody stand there and they begin to speak and say wait just a second I think you got the story wrong brother you need to take that you need to find out the rest of the story amen and that that just right there alone can change so much just your voice of that God give you to begin to speak up for someone amen and how it can change things if it would do that in the natural you begin to think about how when you begin to speak God's word amen and sometimes have you ever spoke something just right it seemed like him all the heavens seemed to open up amen have you ever done that amen just speak to somebody and and just speak the right thing and it felt like my you fix to take a Rapture didn't it amen I believe said one time that's Angels Wings beaten together and I believe it pleases God sometimes we say the things that we say man the Sons and Daughters of God Amen I I read this last time I want to read this quote and and uh start here he said this man sitting here with a gray suit on now brother R's Discerning in the prayer line he says forgive me a minute it may not look eloquent but I'm fix to get some room here he said '' this man sitting here with a gray suit on he said he kind of looking kind of wondering what do you think about it sir you believe you don't know what to do do you maybe if ID tell you if You' believe right now that heart trouble would leave you what about that would you believe it with all your heart you believe it now raise up your hands then and I love this and get out of that old stoop amen sometimes you know what stooping is if if you stoop down to get something you kind of get down low and sometimes that that's just in the natural just you your body get but sometimes we let our spirit get down and get in the stoop a man and we begin to say oh I tell you what nobody cares about me and and this one don't care about me well I tell you if no one else does Jesus Christ cares about you tonight amen and that lot of Alan ought to get you to square your shoulders back sometime and begin to get all those stoop that we get down in amen don't let Satan tell you all you I tell you you'll never get the Holy Ghost you'll you never be healed you'll never get the victory you'll never have joy he's a liar tonight amen sometimes we just need to get out of old stoop that we get down in sir amen he said come on raise up to your feet and accept your healing and be made well Jesus Christ heals you amen what a feeling that is amen God bless you sir go home see it just takes a little something to happen to you this is a part I like he says 'what do you think about it now this lady sat beside him man well Salem will you come right here and I don't mean to embarrass you buddy but he's my buddy anyway so man this woman sitting beside this man he's an old man and he gets called out now I never can explain this to anybody I would never be able to explain this to you brother man how this works but her heart must have been thrilled that this man got called out and God told him he was well through a prophet and she said he told him he said the lady sitting next to you there she reaches down I'm going to read it in a minute but I want to do this first and when he called him out she helped him up to his feet to help him up because he was getting old and I'm telling you God saw that you said Brother s thank you buddy he says what do you think about it now action that don't seem like much does it man just to reach over and get somebody by the arm and help them up you don't think God don't see what you do he says you helped him up there lady that was a nice thing to do sitting next to him there that's very nice I appreciate that so did God I'm going to tell you when God starts appreciating what you're doing yes sir I'm telling you you might not have two nickel to rub together but God starts appreciating what you're doing maybe you had an extra dollar and you threw it in the offering and God appreciated it he did one time to a lady amen I'm telling you he's able to open the windows of Heaven up and pour out a blessing amen he said he could make you the lender and not the borrower man I know we're not in it for money I'm just telling you the things that you do God sees it he said that's very nice I appreciate it so did God I don't know you do I but God knows you doesn't he you're in trouble also isn't that right do you believe God can tell me what your trouble is with all your heart this was a bad place to be in she didn't even know what kind of really all the trouble was but God knew what it was and he said you just have complications don't you the doctor don't even know what's the matter with you you've been in and out of hospitals and operations and everything isn't that right now if that's true stand up to your feet you believe Jesus Christ makes you well now raise up your hands and praise the Lord all right go home and be well the hospital Days Are Over You Believe God Amen for a little act of kindness just to reach over God saw that and I'm telling you God begin to appreciate it amen and when he did this woman she had complications a doctor didn't even know what to do she went home well because of it saying and doing the right things I tell you you you just don't even understand I don't understand sometimes how God can work that way but he appreciates when you begin to speak his word and in faith and amen maybe you just might help somebody maybe it might just be that you know a lot of things the phones used for a lot of things but if it ain't nothing else you might get on the phone and text a brother I've had people come on my heart and text them and and text them a little scripture or something not and find out later they was going through things in their life yes sir I called a man one time excuse me I didn't mean to hit that I called a man one time he kept I was listening to a tape and and I knew he'd been going through some sickness and and I I I kept feeling him come with my heart and finally I thought well you know what if you're not faithful in the little things and probably not going to be faithful in the big things nobody else even knew it I called and got his number and I just telling him my heart I just I was I was praying for him my little he kept coming on my heart real strong and I called him and I said brother I know you've been going through a lot but I said you know what I said I want you to know that I res I respect you and I appreciate the stand that you've taken in your healing for the Lord and I said I just want you to know I was praying for you he was on my heart this morning and I was praying for you he told me he said Brother David he said I believe the Holy Ghost had you called me he said I'm headed to the doctor this morning and he said it's the worst day cuz I never get any good news and he said and you call me and begin to say that he Saidi encourage me and he said I appreciate you calling amen so you never know what you do and what you say how it helps God's children I want I want to ask something brother Morgan if I done something for your one of your boys it'd make you proud wouldn't it even if I didn't do it for you amen it still make you proud brother R said we want to do something for somebody he said you can do it for my children amen if you want to do something for God sometimes say and do things for his children say the right things do the right thing amen am it's good man you remember I know some of these is some of these is very familiar we've heard these some of us since we was little kids and but I just kind of want to take a couple more while I'm on this is you remember Sister Hatty R was sitting there brother brandham it seemed so strange to me that that what she said could have such an impact cuz it seems so small but she was sitting there listening to a prophet I love L to been there that day brother Mark sitting there and listen to the prophet talk about and said them squirrels said I believe brother Brown was saying something like this he said the only thing I can tell you is that the same god Jehovah God that created that Ram in that Thicket said must have he's a Creator and he created those squirrels told Brother BR to speak him into existence brother Wes and a man born in sin on this earth stood there and said let that squirrel come out on that limb and it was something in sister had he right she said that's nothing but the truth buddy I'm telling you there was something beginning to take place there I believe if she would have said I want enough gold to stack Plum up to the roof of my house I Believe it' been right there brother you can call me whatever you want but I believe it whatever she would have said it been there and them boys them young boys laughing and kind of jering and and snickering she said I want the salvation of my two boys and they fell down and give their heart to the Lord am man all because someone was sitting there and said the right thing you remember Sister Weber I I was down she had been told brother bramman went to him and and she said uh she was dying and brother Bram told her said uh told her husband said set your house in order cuz you're going to die and you're going to be left with them young children on your hands your wife's dying well she was sitting there brother Bram call it said she worked down at the government I'm not sure I don't know if she worked at some government offices or what it was hospital or what but wherever she worked she was telling some women that was sitting there she said you know what she said I believe if I could just go down there and he could pray for me one more time that God would heal me and they begin to they begin to talk negative and they said oh there ain't nothing to that stuff anyway said he just and she said now you wait just just a second she said I may be a dying woman but she said I've known Bill brandom since he was brother Brandon but she said I know Bill brandham since for years and she said what he said has come to pass and she said I won't sit here and listen I won SED stand for it Amen brother BR said that the angel come to him and told him he said she'll come in church and she'll be sitting in a certain location by the Travis and he said and you tell her her that I was standing near when she took up for me now was she taking up for brother brandom or was she taking up for God Amen I tell you who she was taken up for she was taken up for both but she was taken up for God when Paul went down there and he was putting Christians to death and that light smoted him down he said I'm Jesus whom thou persecutest he was persecuting the church amen I wouldn't want to start persecuting the people because you start persecuting people you start persecuting in Christ amen so she said the right thing Amen brother Joe it's good to say good things amen you sometimes I think it seems so simple sometimes that it goes way over our head you know we like think of ourself as smart I've never thought of myself as real smart but but we like to think you know we come up with things but it's so simple sometimes it goes over our head just saying and doing the right things amen saying sometimes you know I think like I was telling you earlier a few minutes ago that we ought to get down and sometimes we need to cry out to the Lord and tell him what we have need of you young boys God hears you when you pray it don't matter if you're the oldest one in the back or the youngest one in the front God hears you when you as a little boy I would pray and I see God do things you know when you ask him humbly amen don't think because I'm just a young boy God ain't going to hear me he hears your prayer amen he hears he knows he God Lov he he likes you children to be obedient to your parents and and and love your parents and and do the right thing and say the right thing and when you pray you have power with God Amen just you start David learned the things that he learned he learned he start had to start somewhere David in the Bible amen and he began to learn Faith he had experience and he began to learn Faith by his experiences amen I challenge you to pray and ask God Amen God is no Aaron boy but I'm telling he said to ask and it shall be given man so sister we she wasn't about to take that I don't blame her man I wouldn't either I began to think yesterday brother Joe one time me and my dad we done a lot of tree work and I begin to think that one year been several years ago we went up to do a tree job right on Spring River a guy asked me at work sent me down there and some guy that he knew and had a big tree right there by building and it was like it was I've never had much trouble getting too hot I always drink a lot of water and I sweat and I don't have much trouble but this was one of the first days best I remember it in June and it had been real cool and it got real hot that day and I wasn't used to it and I climbed up in this tree and I started cutting stuff out and I didn't want to come down till I got done you brothers that you brothers that do tree you know what I'm talking about I hate to climb that tree twice but I got up there and man I was getting hot and all of a sudden I got to a point brother Matt and I could tell I was getting too hot I just I I I just I couldn't go any further I I didn't even feel like coming down out of the tree and I said Dad I said would you I got a but I got a build of water in my truck would you grab that out of my cooler and send it up on the rope and he I seen him kind of hurrying he got over any tied on I was glad he was hurrying and I pulled that up and man I sat there I turned I didn't even take it Loose from the Rope I just turned that water up and I started drinking it and I tell you it quenched my thirst it cooled me down got me where I could get finished up and got where I didn't feel like I was so hot and fixed to overheat when I got down I was in the vehicle later and I told my dad I said man Dad I'm glad you hurried I said man I'm about got in trouble I said I've never really got overheated much but I said I was in a place that I started feeling weird and I I I I could I was getting in trouble and my dad D said I could tell by your voice that you was in trouble and I hurried I believe sometimes God might to be able to tell by our voice that we're in trouble God help me today I need help amen there's no perfect people that serves God Amen there's just people that have problems that get saved amen and then we still have problems I I don't people say you preach this way and it'll make people loose it won't to people that has a baptism the Holy Ghost good people can have problems amen but when you find out that you're in the middle of something and you've done wrong he said he was faithful and just to forgive you yes sir amen don't lay and Waller in it and then let Satan start beating you up and telling you you've got a voice speak start speaking the word and move forward amen the problem is Satan gets us Buffalo then you get feelings remember Satan's a spirit and he can anoint you too he wants you to have funny feelings and oh I tell you the reason why you feel that way is because you'll never be saved you'll be lost if you hadn't have done that 40 years ago I tell you this night now that he's a liar he's a li he's a father of it how did how did when when God was here in flesh Jesus Christ standing on this Earth which was God in flesh he had the power brother Matt to defeat Satan literally he had the power to do it am I wrong that's right he had the power to overcome Satan when Satan come to him you know what he did he took the word and he began to quote it he said Satan quoted him some word he quoted Satan some word by it amen he said it's also written amen that you'll live by every word of God it's also written amen he defeated him with the word he never used his power at all that's right amen have a voice to speak brother Brandon was out in the boat one time fishing he said he tried to get out and relax a little bit cuz he was in meetings and things all the time and he said he got out and he was trying to fish a little bit and he was with the I believe his name was brother L Woods and brother Banks Woods all your brothers that listen to the tape sisters you've heard them call brother bankswood W's names many times and I was I was reading and and I my my mother had told me this she was listen to a tape and it kind of Thriller and I couldn't find it for a while and I finally remembered something that brother B said and I looked it up today and they were sitting in the boat and they begin to had been talking about the Lord man that's a good thing ain't it and they begin to talk about the Lord and and all of a sudden brother L and brother Banks begin to talk talk about they said when they was down in the church that they was in when they was young boys I believe it was uh um Jehovah Witness I believe is what they was in and and he said that they began to talk and they said there was a lady an old L older lady that in the church and said you know she was really good to uh said she'd kind of baby the children and she's just a good person and love the little children and stuff and and they remembered that and they was brother said they was sitting in that boat and they was visiting about that and all of a sudden one of them said you know said we ought to go down and tell her that we got saved if we could find her go back and try to find her and tell her that we got saved did you know brother BR said that when they said that that that that word that they was talking about right there found favor with God Amen ain't that powerful am I the only one that to me that's amazing to me amen that someone could say something so simple and find favor with God yes sir am man I'm telling you you say the right things one of these days you'll say it just like sister Weber did the angel of the Lord will be stand there and hear you when you say it amen it's not that every time you say it it's not every time you say that's nothing but the truth Brother David that someone's going to give you a promise like she got but you say and do the right things and it pleases God Amen even if I didn't get a promise like that I still want to please the Lord amen so man it's good to talk and say the right things and you know Satan is such a cunning adversary you know it's been several years ago all of you know Brother David Siler man and me and him's been friends for many years I tell people he was like the little brother I never wanted I'm always wanted don't you tell him I said that no he's always been a buddy to me and one day he called me and I could tell the minute I heard his voice brother Matt it was something that wasn't right and I said what are you doing and he said man I'm down here at the doctor and I think he was there for for his ear he said 'I down here at the doctor and he said I have totally went deaf in one ear I was floored I said are you telling me that you walked in the doctor you could hear and you're in the doctor right now and you can't hear out of that ear and he said that's exactly right and brother Matt it was just like I could see what Satan was doing you know sometimes just cu the people preach brother Joe people get down don't they have you ever been down brother Joe amen I'm not trying to point somebody out I have to you don't just cuz you preach just because you have a gift to preach but Matt you ever get down a little bit man he said I told him I said man that thing it offended me kind of I said David I said that is nothing but the enemy this morning I said he hate you because of the stand that you take on this message and preaching this gospel and he hates you but I said I want to tell you something this morning there's more for us than there is for them and I said if you could look around man brother man I begin to feel something that begin to stir amen see what I'm saying it's not that I'm it's not that I'm could could get up here and tell you it's cuz I try to get up and preach a little bit or something I'm telling you it's cu the presence of God begin to whirl in that room I could feel it going somewhere I said I said if you could look around that hospit that room where you're at today in that doctor's office I said there's Angels encamped around about that place and I said that is nothing but the enemy this morning I refuse to accept it Brother David told me later he said when you begin to speak that he said it was like you was throwing darts at me or something he said I can't explain it but he said my faith begin to take hold and he said my hearing came back in my ear standing back in that office amen you just got to say and do the right things let God take control sometimes amen it was war is more than me speaking man I don't have the ability to speak things like that but the Holy Ghost through you does Amen I'd rather speak positive if you call me and you say brother Dave I'm sick I'm probably not you're probably not going to get me Cody if you call me and say you're sick I'm not going to go I know and I'm almost man I tell you what y'all get your mommy to you know and we the devil's tough and we and we that's never going to help nobody I mean you know I'm going to be I'm going to be easy with you you know I'm going to say well brother I I hate that for you but but we're going to believe what God Said Amen there ain't no sense in backing up if I don't feel if I don't feel one ounce of the Holy Ghost I still have a Nazarite vow I'm going to start speaking over that thing amen I don't you know I've thought about our ministers and and I'm it seems like I'm the most country and UNC here brother Ben was he was kind of laughing one night because I made a statement about a country statement and I said brother that's just no Arkansas language you know I guess you never heard that out there in Arizona and I'm just an old country boy but I don't understand much but I do understand one thing that Jesus Christ is the same yesterday today and forever and there ain't no sense in petting Devils when when you that's the reason why that I may get up here and I may spit and I may have to you brother you I may have to give you a rag to wipe your face off some times if I spit on you I may holler and scream and cry a little bit but I'm going to tell you I want somebody knows a little something about God I don't care if he's got eloquent speech or what he's got as long as he knows a little bit about God Amen I don't care if my pastor can he can get up here and he might not be able to say the words all right furthermore we had a propit in this day and some of the words he said it was pretty simple he had he knew it too he said he even told the brother he said brother won't you get up there and speak he said because I I'd get I'd get up there and say uh um instead of uh participate he'd say anticipate or something you know and his speech was but I'm telling you he knew more about God than than all of them put together knew about God Amen I tell you they've come from all over the world and call all over the world to to get to where they could he have him just pray one time for him amen so we find out that I've talked about many different voices but I want to tell you another voice that there is brother Mike got on it Sunday the scripture I believe it's Hebrews I believe it's Hebrews 24 says that the blood of Christ speaketh better things now all y'all read it and I won't go into a bunch but you all know that the blood of Abel Cried Out Abel was righteous and and when Cain killed him and his blood was on the earth his his blood began to cry out amen God knew God knew what was going on and that blood cried the blood of Jesus cried but it didn't just cry out but listen it had Redemption amen amen it speaketh better things than that of the blood of Abel the Bible says it speaks better things than the Old Testament we find out the Old Testament spoke of guilt in the New Testament speaks of redemption the Old Testament it spoke of death New Testament speaks of Resurrection amen so the blood of Jesus Christ today is here to speak for you how many has the baptism of the Holy Ghost amen the blood is here listen to me the blood speaks by the Holy Ghost amen you have the word and the Holy Ghost anoints the word amen and it begins to speak for you it's speaks better things amen if you're down I believe today that the blood of Christ can can lift you up a little bit amen if you're sick a little bit the blood of Jesus Christ begins to speak I believe it can cause you to get well amen I believe it speaks of sorrow in the Old Testament in the New Testament it begins to speak of life I wrote some things down here it speaks of Grace yes sir speaks of healing Joy speaks of power speaks of Heaven it speaks of the Millennium all the Redemptive blessings that the blood was shed for is yours tonight amen if we could really get a revelation of that I believe that we just reach out and take it just like if I said you know what this knife is yours come get it and he came up here and got it I believe that that's the way if we would just take the mindset that Jesus you promised it you promised it to me tonight and I take hold of the promise amen and let the blood begin to speak for you amen you may say see I say this because I know the tactics of the devil brother BR said to overcome your enemy was to know him and all of his tricks and I'm going to tell you a really good trick that he's got and I bet there's some of you gonna be sitting there and go man he's talking to me if you ever make a mistake Satan don't want to ever let you forget it I don't know why that keeps coming back but that just I I know I know his tricks and I know Satan and I know what he does I know what he he's done it to me because youve done that certain sort of thing I'm telling you can't get right you knew better than to do it when you done it amen the Bible says David talked about iniquity and he made it sound like that man a man that committed iniquity would go down in an instant then he comes along and says blessed is the man whom God won't even impute iniquity do you realize that when brother B teaches that that on on uh believing and disbelieving and on on going too far he says that a a Believer can't even go too far you can't even blaspheme amen if you're really a child of God cuz what you want you're not going to say it you're not going to say anything to blaspheme so Satan begins to he begins to hammer at you and he tells you you know I tell you if you hadn't done that 42 years ago and you remember you done this and you done that and because you done that and he begins to tell you and bring it all up whatever it is you fill in the blanks but whatever it is but I want you to know tonight that the blood is speaking for you and I want you to know that the blood of Christ speaks louder than what Satan could ever speak it don't matter what I say even if I said oh tell you what you you couldn't get forgiveness sure you wouldn't know that it the blood of Jesus Christ speaks louder than me amen it's speaking forgiveness for you today if you just step brother brand on one tape I believe is be certain of God he prayed for them and he said now you go out of here and don't you ever disbelieve it no more you have been forgiven this morning amen the blood of Jesus Christ does not the bible say that it cleanses us from all unrighteousness amen he that's born of God does not commit sin and and it's not that uh it's not that we don't have failures it's not the mistakes it's that sin is unbelief you're not going to disbelieve we'll have failures brother R said you'll do wrong he said you'll willfully do wrong but he said get ready you're going to pay for it furthermore he says if you think you can do it and get by with it he said that shows you don't have it to start out with so amen if we're I don't know where that come from that wasn't even in my notes but I I just trying to encourage you to let you know I don't want to just keep repeating myself but the blood of Jesus Christ tonight it's going to speak louder there's a scripture in Isaiah I got to get this no weapon that is formed against thee shall prosper and every tongue now I'm not real smart but I know without a tongue a tongue is identified with speech so if it's got a tongue then there's going to be something try to speak against you on that day let me start over no weapon that is formed against thee shall prosper that that promise alone right there somebody ought to go oh praise the Lord there's no weapon going to be formed against me ever it's going to prosper today and every tongue that shall rise against thee in judgment Thou shalt condemn this is the heritage heritage has to do with with the a uh being an heir this is the Heritage your heir to it of the Servants of the Lord and their righteousness is of me sayeth the Lord amen how can you lose on that day amen with the blood speaking for you it's going to speak louder it don't matter Satan can accuse you God can get his book out and go I'm sorry but it's all been wiped out amen it's all gone the blood spalk for him and I don't even see it no more amen if God if the blood wasn't speaking for us tonight he'd kill every one of us amen I love this scripture if we say that we have fellowship with him and walk in darkness we lie I'm sorry this is uh 1 John 1 if we say that we have fellowship with him and walk in darkness we lie and do not the truth but if we walk in the light as he is the light we have Fellowship one with the other and the blood of Jesus Christ his son cleanseth us from all sin if we say that we have no sin we deceive ourselves and the truth is not in us if we confess our sins he is faithful and just to forgive us our sins and to cleanse us from all unrighteousness if we say that we've not sinned we make him a liar and his word is not in US amen faithful and just to for give you amen don't fall for don't fall for Satan's tricks and let him beat you up and just go to get down somewhere and pray and begin to pray and ask the Lord Lord I'm sorry I did that there's something in you and I know there's people here I I I preaching sometimes you preach kind of one-sided but I believe there's people here I know there's Christian people here that do that amen we all have failes we all have mistakes amen but I have confidence in you I know God does too amen but I just don't want youall know some sometimes when you get down and Satan tries to cut you out from everybody else and he tries to start talking to you and begin to tell you that oh I tell you you'll never make it you that well God promised it the blood said I would amen you tell Satan next time he begins to tell you you tell you say the blood told me I was going to make it amen the word told me and it's anointed by the blood the life that was in the blood the Holy Spirit and it said I was going to make it man no weapon that's formed is's ever going to prosper anyway amen I have a quote here I'd like to read if you'd give me just a he says and this is in Revelations chapter number three paragraph 120 he says all right here was voices Oh how we need in Jeffersonville thousands of lived voices is this mine it's not don't drink out of that the Thunder what we need in Jeffersonville thousands of lived voices it's good to have a voice but your life needs to match your voice have you ever have you ever heard that old saying that voice uh your life speaks louder than than what you're saying amen what you do speaks louder sometimes than your voice so it's okay to have a voice but just make sure that you know that your life is matching it but we need thousands of lived voices the Thunder of God thundering out in sweetness and Holiness Purity undefiled lives walking around in the Earth today without a blemish yes sir real Christians that's Thunder against the enemy the the devil don't care how loud you can holler the devil don't care how much you can jump or how much you can do this or shout but What Hurts The Devil is to see that Sanctified holy consecrated to God say anything to him call him anything just as sweet as he can be and move right on oh my that throws him away that's the Thunder that shakes the devil amen amen how many' like to shake the devil tonight amen I would too amen man God help me y'all pray for me that that God had helped me to you know I've been a Christian for a lot of years and y'all help pray for me that God would just help me in all that I do whether it be my Ministry and or trying to minister a little bit and sing or whatever I do I want to do it from my heart you know brother BR told that time he said that brother I believe it was Paul Raider he was in there and he said him and his wife had had a little spat that morning and he started out of the house and and he said he he reached over and she got behind the door and she's kind of crying and he thought well you know if that's the way she's going to be just let her be that way and he as he went out the door he always kissed her and he went over and he he kissed her and he walked out the door and he got in he'd always turn around and say you know goodbye and she'd say goodbye and he said uh he did and he walked down the street and something got to something got to eatting on him he got to thinking and he thought you know what if something would happen to her today or what something happened to me he said you know I'd hate that he said I don't I don't want to leave like that he said he turned around and he walked back he walked in the house and she's behind the door crying he said he reached up and got a hold of her and pulled her up he said he kissed her just like before he said he got to the end of the driveway he turned around he said goodbye and she said goodbye he said the difference was the second one had a feeling in it amen I want God I always want to have feeling and feeling for the people and feeling for what you're doing you got to have feeling for one another Amen brother bandam said that brother Bram said when that uh blind man got healed in Mexico what' he do he said I put my feet kind up close to his and found out my shoes wouldn't fit and he thought well if I give you my coat he began to enter in and begin to feel sorry for him have compassion on him amen had a Godly passion and he said then something took place amen and a man got his eyesight and began to holler and rump across Glory he said amen God healed him right there on the platform because got have feeling feeling for one another and pray for one another I know brother B said they used to come to church and he said they'd hug one another and cry and say it's going to be next service before we get to see one another brother Joe amen man we just we don't want to lose brother brother BR said Brotherly Love even with ceasing and do we don't want to get to the point that we get cold and indifferent God help us not just preaching My Heart Like I said you feel kind of bad saying things like that but just it's it's not to hurt it's to try to step you Stone to try to help I need help too today I want y'all to pray for me God help me man to just do what I'm supposed to do and man we should pray and do all we can for one another and I do I thank of the church and I pray for them and I than other places and pray for themen and anyway we just like I said our voices sometimes you don't even have to say a thing when you're out in your community you just walk along and you just live for God and I've had people in the job just a few minutes and they say where do you go to church at and I said what makes you think I go to church and they said I can just tell you go to church somewhere there's something different about you amen you thankful tonight amen I hope this was I hope this was some kind of help to somebody I just was such a just a little I guess a little small thought that wasn't real deepen but maybe it might help us along the way but to say and do the right thing if you would you stand to your feet and music players come you don't even know what time it is but I've been I've been probably 45 minutes so Amen brother B said under their messenger the bride would even be the final voice to the final age amen do y'all do y'all have the words to that song uh my sins are gone you ask me why I'm happy and I'll just tell you why because my sins are gone y'all seing that can you play that do you have the words to it you that's going to be too high you ask me why I'm happy so I'll just tell you why because my sins are gone and when I meet the scoffers who ask me where they are I say my sins are gone they're underneath the blood on the cross of Calvary as far removed as darkness is from dawn in the sea of God's forgetfulness that's good enough for me praise God my sins are gone was at the old time altar where God came in my heart and now my sins are gone the Lord took full possession the devil did depart I'm glad my sins are gone they underneath the blood on the cross of Calvary as far removed as Darkness s know in the sea of God's forgetful love that's good enough for me praise God oh my sins are gone when Satan comes to tempt me and tries to make me die I say my sins are gone you got me into trouble but Jesus got me out I'm glad my there the blood on the cross of as [Music] as in the sea of God's for that's good enough for me praise God my sins are gone amen I appreciate yall being so attentive and listening coming out on such a bad night isn't the presence of the Lord so good amen I just if we would let's just bow our hearts for precious Heavenly Father Lord I just I pray tonight that Lord you saw the request and the different things that was made known at the first of the service I know brother Tony told me and I believe they brother mat was going to mentioned that brother James I believe it was his cousin and Lord he's in Hospice and with cancer and not doing good Lord and I just Lord tonight I I don't know where he's at with the Lord even but God I pray tonight that you'd just see where he's at and that you'd have your way God and I pray for the people here Lord I just pray tonight that you'd help us help us always to remember to say good things Lord and say and do good things Lord I just uplift you and before people I just thank you Lord for all you've done for us and I thank you for helping each one tonight I pray that Lord for those that couldn't make it if there be I know there's a lot of sickness in the land lord I pray tonight that you'd be with them we'd be careful to give you the praise and Jesus name we ask it amen and amen amen oh touching Jesus is all that really [Music] matters and then your life will never be the same there is only one way to [Music] you is all that really matters and then your life will never ever be the same and there's only one way to touch him you must believe when you call on his [Music] name oh the blood that Jes Jesus shed for me way back on [Music] Cal oh the blood that gives me strength from day to day it will never lose it power for it reaches to the highest [Music] mountain and I know that it flows to the lowest Val oh the blood that gives me strength from day today it will never lose it power for it reaches to the highest mountain and I know that it flows to the lowest valy for the blood that gives me strength from day to day it will [Music] never lose it power amen how many believes that this evening that there's power in the blood of Jesus Christ amen I don't I don't know anything that I'd rather have speaking on my behalf Paul said the blood of Jesus speaks better things things amen I that that's the voice that we have I believe that's what's speaking through the Bride of Jesus Christ it's the very blood that God gave us this the very life of God Brother David said that's what's speaking through us and I that's what we need speaking on our behalf I sure appreciate Brother David just just uh help many enjoyed that message tonight and amen God bless you brother I appreciate a a man that'll just follow his hard and and and uh and have a a message that is very it's it's very straight to the point that we have our voice matters amen the things we say and do and and uh I just I really pray I know I know the Lord was really has really spoke to us anytime the word Goes Forth you can recognize it coming from the Lord and I appreciate Brother David just being obedient to the Lord and speaking to our heart and and what a what a good advice that God I I really en enjoyed you saying that that or reading that quote or the story of that lady because she helped somebody to their feet so but God appreciates it too the little things that we do and say and I I don't know about you but I want God to appreciate what I do amen and I believe he does he believe he appreciates our efforts and coming to serve the Lord and and what a what an encouragement a good word of encouragement tonight and that God hears what we do and he sees what we do the little things that we seem like are just just repetitive and you know even coming to church on a Wednesday night and and just saying amen or just singing a song and it seems like we do the same thing all the time but God sees it all brother BR said there ain't one praise that you can let out of these mortal lips that God ain't worthy of I believe we have a right to praise God every time we come in the house of God we worship the Lord we sing We Praise Him we praise him on the High symbol and on the low symbol on the stringed instrument with everything that has a voice says praise ye the Lord how many say that tonight praise ye the Lord amen there I just appreciate the blood of Jesus Christ we want to remember um our uh brother Joe is is going taking the youth to the meeting uh leaving on on uh on the Thursday October 22nd and we need to know by tomorrow the young people that are going to be attending uh we have to to pay for the reservations to make sure that that happens uh so so be sure and let us know uh let brother Joe know um so that he can uh kind of get all that orchestrated and and if you call and tell me I'm not will forget to tell brother Joe so it's it's October it's in February did I say October amen that's bow season amen but it's February we're going next month so we need to know by tomorrow because October is a long long way away Brother David said sometimes you mean to say uh uh participate and you say other things so God bless you I knew he was talking about me when he when he he was saying that and I remember you these girls have picked on me since since we first started having church cuz one day I said what what kind of there's participators and and there's all kinds of things and I use the wrong word and and I but anyway they've made fun of me for for five years over that so sometimes we just say the wrong thing amen that I I just that's why as a preacher you know what you you why you want a pull of people can I give you this for free tonight before we go you love the Lord tonight we just having Church anyway we just we're we're out here on a Wednesday night but that's why a preacher loves a good pull from people because a pull from people brings an anointing and under an anointing you'll say and do things that you don't even have the ability to say and do that's why you that's why you want an anointing in the church and so I I I appreciate I appreciate you I appre we wouldn't even be able to have church if it wasn't for people that wanted to come and have church can you imagine having Church by yourself I know people do it and I and I pray for them I pray the Lord will give them people to have fellowship with it's a very tough thing but I thank God that we have a body of Believers that come and they pull from the word of God and brother DAV was speaking tonight he said that's not even in my notes what causes you uh to get to get out of your own uh uh character your own own nature and say things that minister to people's hearts it's a pull from people amen I believe that we have a right to pull from the word what we have need of that was all free but we want to remember that please let brother Joe know February 22nd we're going to going to that meeting also uh this Saturday I don't know the date but this Saturday morning at 9:00 a.m. we're having a fellowship dinner over here at the fellowship hall and uh I believe the dinner will be around uh around noon or so 11:30 brother brother Joe's cooked chili for all the brothers that want to come and participate in the fellowship dinner and so we'll also we're going to try to do a little work on the fellowship hall while we're there during the dinner trying we keep everybody busy because we don't have heat in there and we we've learned that if you keep busy in the cold weather then you stay warm so we want to keep everybody busy during the fellowship dinner and everybody stay warm and we'll we'll get the building done I appreciate you Brothers y that that came last Saturday we got so much done we had so many people here we didn't even know what to do and uh but we but that's what we want and we we sure enjoyed it and won't y'all give them a hand clap and for for coming and best I mean it it it's the best group of people you ever work with nobody fights nobody's mad at each other and they everybody just gets out there and does something and and and and and it gets done and so we're we're thankful and how many's looking forward to having that Fellowship all done amen just a few more days of Labor and we we've saved the best for last we we we we uh we we made it look like it it's going to be a long time to get done but I but you watch and see just over a few week period that whole entire building will make a major transformation and we'll be able to use it in a few weeks and so uh but that only happens when we have these wonderful Fellowship dinners on Saturday so we appreciate you brother's support and your help and may God bless you how many feels good tonight amen you love the Lord how many loves going to church how many loves your brothers and sisters by you amen love having Fellowship amen let's just bow our heads together gracious Heavenly Father Lord we thank you for your spirit here

voice that the very voice as Brother David said tonight let the voice that we live Lord let it speak out and Lord let it reflect the very life of Jesus Christ Lord I pray God that you would encourage each one Lord May something that was said would be an encouragement to them Lord I pray you'd strengthen them as we go Lord when we come back for our next service Lord that we would be just ready and to hear the word of God and Lord we just ask that you would help each one heal those that are sick Lord and God bring them back to service safely we ask in Jesus Christ's name we pray amen amen God bless you tonight well what can wash away my sin nothing but the blood of Jesus who one can make me whole again nothing but the blood of Jesus oh precious is the flow that makes me why I as no no other found I know nothing but the blood of Jesus we walk can wash away my sins nothing but the blood of Jesus will walk can make me whole again and nothing but the blood
