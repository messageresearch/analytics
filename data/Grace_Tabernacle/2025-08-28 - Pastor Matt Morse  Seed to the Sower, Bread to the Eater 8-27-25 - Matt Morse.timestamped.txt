[35:53] Oh, but now
[35:56] I see. Oh, it was grace that taught. Oh,

[38:25] Praise God.
[38:28] Praise God.
[38:30] Praise God.
[38:33] Praise God.
[38:35] Praise God.
[38:39] Oh, when we

[38:46] 10,000
[38:48] years,
[38:50] &gt;&gt; bright shining
[38:53] as the sun.
[38:58] We will have no
[39:02] less days
[39:05] to sing
[39:07] God's praise
[39:10] than when
[39:12] we first
[39:15] begun.
[39:18] Amen. How many's thankful for the
[39:21] amazing grace of our Lord Jesus? Amen.
[39:25] just to think that one day we'll get
[39:27] over there on the other side. And I
[39:29] can't think of a time that we'll ever
[39:31] want it to end. And you know, I I used
[39:34] to say as when I was a little boy, I was
[39:35] scared to death to go to heaven because
[39:37] it never ended. I I was a little
[39:39] claustrophobic and I didn't have much of
[39:42] a revelation. And finally, I got a
[39:45] little older and some guy asked me one
[39:46] day, he said, "Well," he said, "Are you
[39:48] done living today?" And I said, "Well,
[39:50] no, I'm I'm not done living today." He
[39:52] said, "Well, I'll ask you again
[39:53] tomorrow.
[39:54] Next day he are you done living today? I
[39:56] said no I'm not done living today. He
[39:58] said well don't you think it'll be like
[39:59] that over there like you ain't ever
[40:01] going to come a day you say I'm just
[40:03] done living and our minds can't even
[40:05] fathom the the glory that it'll be.
[40:08] Amen. Just to be able to live in that
[40:11] precious city. I still believe that
[40:12] tonight. I believe that God has a
[40:15] promise to the believers that there will
[40:17] be a new heaven and a new earth that'll
[40:19] sit right down on this earth. And I
[40:21] believe that we'll all gather there
[40:23] together with all the the loved ones
[40:25] that's gone on before us and we'll be
[40:28] able to stand arm in arm and worship
[40:30] around the throne of God and be able to
[40:32] fellowship one with another and visit
[40:34] and you can spend a thousand years just
[40:37] talking to Moses about all the the
[40:39] journey that they had taken, all the
[40:41] questions that you ever had. Can you
[40:42] imagine what it'll be like that day? And
[40:45] friends, it's not just a story, it's a
[40:47] reality. Amen. And we're looking forward
[40:49] to that. Amen. and you love the Lord
[40:51] tonight. Amen. Just want to greet
[40:53] everybody in the name of the Lord. And
[40:56] maybe just before we open the word of
[40:58] God, we'll go before the Lord in prayer.
[41:01] Just have a couple of needs uh serious
[41:04] needs tonight. Sister MNA Alexander has
[41:08] been transported to the ER and that is
[41:12] Britney and and Lorie's grandmother.
[41:15] Just ask prayer for her. Also for
[41:18] Samantha Farmer's aunt. Thelma has been
[41:21] diagnosed with cancer stage or sorry
[41:24] stage three kidney failure and just
[41:27] asked that the Lord would touch her.
[41:29] Maybe if you have a need on your heart
[41:30] tonight, I know God is mindful of what
[41:32] we have need of. So won't we just ask
[41:34] him to come in a special way and meet
[41:37] each one of these? Amen. Gracious
[41:39] heavenly father, Lord, how we love you
[41:41] tonight. And Lord, I count it a
[41:44] privilege to be able to come and just to
[41:46] stand in this house of God, Lord, a
[41:48] place that's been dedicated, Lord, for
[41:51] the word of God to go forth. And Lord, I
[41:54] just ask you tonight, Lord, that we just
[41:56] feel your presence, Lord. And we thank
[41:58] you for being here with us. Lord, we
[42:00] just pray, Lord, that you would meet
[42:02] these needs, Lord, knowing that that
[42:04] without you, Lord, we would have no
[42:06] answer to all things. But God, we just
[42:08] ask you that you would intercede. Lord,
[42:10] I I pray for a family, Lord, in the
[42:13] church, Lord, that was asking for prayer
[42:15] today. Lord, I pray that you would meet
[42:17] them, Lord, knowing they're in a dire
[42:20] situation, Lord, looking for direction.
[42:22] And Lord, I pray that you would just
[42:24] help them, Lord. Any that would be here
[42:26] tonight, Lord, that would need help from
[42:28] you tonight. Lord, I pray that we would
[42:29] just draw from you, Lord. May you speak
[42:32] to every heart, Lord. Even those that
[42:33] are watching the services, Lord, I pray
[42:36] that every service would be a blessing,
[42:38] Lord. God, that something that would be
[42:40] said that would be a help to them, Lord.
[42:42] And we'll just be careful to give you
[42:44] the glory for everything that you do. In
[42:46] Jesus Christ's name we pray. Amen. Amen.
[42:50] We just want to invite you to the
[42:52] scripture tonight. We're going to read
[42:54] out of the book of Isaiah in the 55th
[42:56] chapter. And sure appreciate our
[42:58] musicians tonight. How many enjoy the
[43:01] good music? Amen.
[43:03] Amen.
[43:06] I did that to y'all Sunday too, didn't
[43:08] I? I had you. We're the best Bible
[43:10] holding clappers that there is. And you
[43:12] know, somebody got on to us for
[43:14] clapping, you know, here here the other
[43:16] day. And I said, "Well, the when you get
[43:17] that out of the book of Psalms, then you
[43:19] might get it out of this church, but
[43:20] until you can erase it from the Bible,
[43:22] you ain't erasing it out of here." So,
[43:24] amen. We just love to praise the Lord.
[43:26] And whether it's whether it's saying
[43:27] amen or shouting or clapping or dancing
[43:29] or as long as it's in this Bible, then
[43:32] it's good in this building. Amen. I
[43:33] think that's the way it ought to be. If
[43:34] it's in the Bible, it's good in the
[43:36] Bible. It's good in the building. Amen.
[43:38] Amen. So, we just love the Lord. Uh, but
[43:40] I I want to uh speak out of Isaiah the
[43:42] 55th chapter and I'm going to read from
[43:44] the 10th verse and the 11th verse. And
[43:47] we'll give you just a moment to turn
[43:49] there. Also, just be remembering Brother
[43:51] Andrew. He was preaching up in West
[43:53] Virginia at Brother Lily. So, we want to
[43:56] remember him tonight that the Lord would
[43:57] use him. Amen. So, we just want to read
[44:00] Isaiah 55 in the 10th chapter. The Bible
[44:03] says, "For as the rain cometh down, and
[44:06] the snow from heaven, and returnneeth
[44:08] not thither, but waterth the earth, and
[44:10] maketh it bring forth uh and bud, that
[44:13] it may give seed to the swer and bread
[44:16] to the eater. So shall my word be that
[44:19] goeth forth out of my mouth. It shall
[44:20] not return unto me void, but it shall
[44:23] accomplish that which I please, and it
[44:25] shall prosper in the thing where I sent
[44:28] it."
[44:29] I know this is a very common scripture,
[44:31] but as you take your seats tonight, I
[44:33] would like to speak on this subject on
[44:36] seed to the swer and bread to the eater.
[44:39] Seed to the sewer and bread to the
[44:41] eater. I I know every one of us could uh
[44:43] quote this scripture uh no doubt many uh
[44:46] times that we've read out of this and uh
[44:49] but there was just something that the
[44:50] Lord had put on my heart tonight about
[44:53] it and uh just kind of a fresh thought.
[44:55] I had been studying on on a on a series
[44:58] and you know there's nothing like
[44:59] getting uh just to get away from it a
[45:01] little bit and just have a fresh thought
[45:03] from the Lord. And I don't think there's
[45:05] anything better than being alone with
[45:06] God with a piece of paper. Amen. And so
[45:09] we just uh sure uh love what God does
[45:13] for us. Brother, that's really echo. And
[45:14] I don't know how to fix that. If you can
[45:17] maybe uh take some of that out or
[45:19] something to to help it. It it was right
[45:21] right there in my ears. So, um, but but
[45:23] we want to take a moment on this tonight
[45:25] and maybe it would be a help to the
[45:27] church. And so, uh, be a a blessing to
[45:31] you. Um, but the Bible says that the
[45:34] word of God is seed to the swer and is
[45:37] bread to the eater. And so, uh, here
[45:40] this comes out of the book of Isaiah,
[45:41] out of the portion of scripture, uh,
[45:43] Isaiah is actually in two parts. I know
[45:46] there's, uh, there's there's several
[45:47] parts in this scripture. It's a very
[45:49] common scripture but has quite a
[45:51] powerful revelation. And here in the
[45:53] book of Isaiah, in the second part of
[45:55] Isaiah, first Isaiah was speaking on the
[45:57] judgment of Israel uh in how that God
[46:00] was bringing a judgment against them for
[46:02] uh uh the the the decisions that they
[46:04] had made. But then in the second part of
[46:06] Isaiah, he actually is showing the
[46:08] faithfulness of God to restore Israel.
[46:10] And uh so and in this part of Isaiah he
[46:13] actually shows uh that although that
[46:16] people are unfaithful but yet God is
[46:18] faithful to fulfill his purpose. So uh
[46:20] and he actually uses this many times we
[46:23] can look at uh at ourselves and uh to
[46:26] realize that God is faithful to perform.
[46:28] This is what Isaiah is talking about
[46:30] that even though we may fail but God uh
[46:32] he's going to bring his purpose to pass.
[46:34] And just to summarize this word, Isaiah
[46:36] 55, Isaiah is actually speaking of a
[46:38] word of God that is being spoken. And I
[46:40] would like to take this tonight and
[46:42] maybe uh just uh maybe you can take it
[46:44] as this of some future instruction for
[46:47] every other service that we ever come
[46:48] to. So uh can somebody uh uh uh just to
[46:52] give us the opportunity tonight? I
[46:54] believe that that ought to be our
[46:55] purpose uh is to be pleasing unto God.
[46:58] So here when Isaiah is speaking this,
[47:00] he's he's saying just to sum it up, he's
[47:03] saying that when the word of God is
[47:05] being spoken, it gives both seed to the
[47:07] swer and it gives bread to the eater.
[47:09] Now there's four main parts to this
[47:11] scripture. Uh in the first part of it,
[47:13] Isaiah first talks about the seed. It
[47:15] gives seed to the sewer. Now we know
[47:17] what a seed is. A seed, it's not just a
[47:20] thing that goes into the ground, that
[47:21] little thing that we carry around in a
[47:23] packet, but actually by definition, a
[47:25] seed is anything that can be sown that
[47:28] has the ability to bring forth life. And
[47:30] so when you think of a seed, you know, I
[47:32] think of all the way back before there
[47:33] was ever creation, there was seeds.
[47:35] Before God ever said, "Let there be
[47:37] light." Before God ever spoke this
[47:39] world, uh uh anything kind of a life
[47:42] that we have. But Ram said, "There was
[47:44] already a seed." Remember the guy that
[47:45] came to him? He said, "I don't know why
[47:46] y'all can believe that God created the
[47:49] world in six days." And he said, "Well,
[47:50] we believe it because it was in the
[47:52] Bible." And they said, "Well, but all of
[47:54] science says that the earth is millions
[47:56] of years old." He said, "Well, what's
[47:57] that got to do with it?" You know,
[47:59] because the Bible said that in the
[48:01] beginning, God created the heaven and
[48:03] the earth. And the earth was without
[48:04] form. It was void and darkness was upon
[48:07] the face of the deep. And the spirit of
[48:09] God moved upon the face of the waters.
[48:11] And God said, "Let there be light." And
[48:14] there was light. And brother Bam said,
[48:15] "And I believe that every seed was
[48:18] laying right there from some other
[48:20] civilization or something and as soon as
[48:22] the water lifted off and the light
[48:24] struck it, up come the trees and
[48:26] everything else." Isn't that quite a
[48:27] thought tonight to think that before
[48:30] that this world existed the way we know
[48:32] it and before God said, "Let there be
[48:34] light." even in this voidness or the
[48:36] this blackness of what science can go
[48:39] and they can show you by by uh carbon
[48:41] dating that it was millions and billions
[48:44] of year old of years old. But brother
[48:46] Mark all those millions and billions of
[48:48] years that lay there that there was a
[48:50] seed or something that lay there. But
[48:52] whenever God made the atmosphere just
[48:54] right, then that seed that was laid
[48:56] dormant, when the atmosphere was
[48:58] perfected, you realize that before it
[49:00] was perfected, there was an apple seed,
[49:01] there was an orange seed, there was a
[49:03] pear seed. Every tree that we see that
[49:05] God made, it was laying in the earth
[49:08] before God ever said, "Let there be
[49:09] light." I I thought, "Isn't that
[49:11] something?" Here, the seed was laying
[49:13] there dormant, and it was just waiting
[49:15] on an atmosphere change so that it could
[49:17] bring forth a life. And I thought, if
[49:19] that's the way it was with a natural
[49:20] seed, then what about with a spiritual
[49:22] seed? Every natural seed was just
[49:25] waiting on an atmosphere to bring forth
[49:27] life. Well, then if that was that way in
[49:29] the natural, then so is every word of
[49:32] God a seed. Somebody say a seed. You
[49:34] say, "Well, what makes the word of God a
[49:36] seed?" I'll just tell you by definition
[49:38] because it has the ability to bring
[49:41] forth life. And anything that has the
[49:44] ability to bring forth life is a seed.
[49:46] That's what the word of God is. It's
[49:48] something that has the ability to bring
[49:50] forth life. That that's what Jesus was.
[49:52] You realize that Jesus who was the word
[49:55] of God made flesh. In the beginning was
[49:57] the word. The word was God. The word was
[49:59] made flesh. So Jesus was the word of
[50:01] God. And then when Jesus would speak, he
[50:04] actually revealed the purpose of the
[50:06] word of God. He said, "The thief comes
[50:08] to steal and to kill and to destroy." He
[50:10] said, "But I come that they might have
[50:13] life." So here Jesus reveals the very
[50:15] divine purpose of the word of God it was
[50:18] life. So the purpose of all of it of the
[50:20] very word of God in the beginning the
[50:22] word of God today the very purpose of
[50:24] God's word is to give life and the
[50:26] purpose of it is life. So if every word
[50:29] of God is a seed then that tells us that
[50:31] every word of God has the ability to
[50:34] bring forth life. How many believes that
[50:36] every word of God if it's a seed it has
[50:39] the ability to bring forth life. That's
[50:41] why that's why you see that we love
[50:43] going to church. That that's why we come
[50:44] to the house of God and we love hearing
[50:46] the word of God being preached and we we
[50:48] pull from the gift of God because we
[50:51] realize that it don't take a lot of the
[50:52] word of God to produce life. It matter
[50:55] of fact, every word of God has the power
[50:57] to bring forth life. And we realize as
[51:00] believers tonight that it only takes one
[51:02] word. It takes one word spoke at the
[51:04] right time to change anything about your
[51:06] life. It don't matter what situation
[51:08] that you're going through tonight or
[51:09] what troubles that you have or or how
[51:11] bad it is at work or how bad it is at
[51:14] home that you know that when you come in
[51:15] the presence of God that all it takes is
[51:18] one word spoken at the right time about
[51:21] the right situation. It's enough to
[51:22] change everything. It's enough to turn a
[51:25] situation around. It's enough to change
[51:27] a heart. It's enough to turn somebody to
[51:29] God. It's enough to put the devil in his
[51:31] place. It's enough to cause a revival in
[51:34] your heart. All it takes is one word of
[51:36] God spoken at the right time about the
[51:39] right situation. It's enough to change
[51:40] it. I want I I believe that tonight. I
[51:42] wonder how many believes that that
[51:44] somebody say just one word. It don't
[51:46] take a lot of word of God. It takes just
[51:48] one word of God to bring forth life.
[51:51] Just one word, it can give life. One
[51:53] word can give hope. One word can bring
[51:55] faith. One word can restore. I'll tell
[51:57] you something tonight, friends, that one
[51:59] word of God can make a hopeless case
[52:02] seem like a probability.
[52:04] All it takes is one word of God. That's
[52:07] why when a minister comes to preach and
[52:09] he labors to preach the word of God, how
[52:11] many knows what Brother Bam said? He
[52:12] said 20 minutes of anointed preaching
[52:14] was like eight hours of hard labor. He
[52:17] said, "But the preacher keeps on
[52:18] laboring and he keeps on preaching."
[52:20] Said, "Why do you keep on laboring?" He
[52:22] said, "Because maybe there just sits a
[52:24] poor person sitting here with cancer and
[52:26] we know that just one word will do the
[52:29] work." I thought, "Isn't that that way
[52:30] tonight? Maybe there's somebody here
[52:32] with cancer. Or maybe somebody with
[52:34] sickness. Maybe somebody that has a
[52:36] family trouble. Maybe somebody that
[52:38] Satan has been tormenting your mind so
[52:39] much that your problems are so big that
[52:42] you don't have a way out of it. But you
[52:44] know that it only takes one word spoken
[52:46] at the right time that it can bring life
[52:48] and it can change everything about that
[52:50] situation. Friends, I believe that so
[52:52] much tonight. I believe that if you
[52:54] could ever get one word to rise off the
[52:56] pages of this Bible and become a reality
[52:58] to your heart, it can set your soul on
[53:00] fire. You can walk in here with your
[53:02] head down, but you can walk out lifted
[53:04] up rejoicing and praising God cuz one
[53:07] word was enough to restore life to a
[53:11] dying soul.
[53:12] &gt;&gt; You don't have to be a theologian. You
[53:14] don't have to be a great scholar. Let me
[53:16] tell you what the prophet said. He said,
[53:17] "You might read the word as a scholar
[53:19] and know all the ins and outs of the
[53:21] word." He said, "But it wouldn't do you
[53:23] no good unless that word was quickened
[53:24] to you." But you know what he said? He
[53:26] said, "But if you only knew one word and
[53:29] it's quickened, then that's what you
[53:32] need. Just one word. It don't matter how
[53:34] much of it you know, it's that you know
[53:36] a word of God that's been quickened to
[53:38] your heart." That's why that's why we
[53:40] pull from a gift of God. Lord, speak
[53:42] something to me, Lord, that would come
[53:43] to life. You say, "Well, which word do I
[53:45] need to bring to bring me out of this
[53:47] situation? Which word do I need, brother
[53:50] Mark, that'll bring forth life?" It
[53:51] don't matter which word it is because
[53:53] every word in the Bible is God's
[53:55] thoughts that are laying in seed form.
[53:57] And if it's if it's received into the
[54:00] human being and spoke by the same
[54:01] thought that materialized the Bible,
[54:03] brother Bram said it will bring it to
[54:05] pass. So it don't matter, brother Caleb,
[54:08] what word it is. It it don't matter. It
[54:09] don't matter what scripture it is. One
[54:11] word of God. Every word of God is the
[54:14] thoughts of God and it's laying in seed
[54:16] form, waiting for you to receive it into
[54:18] yourself
[54:19] &gt;&gt; and bring it to pass. I believe that
[54:22] tonight. You know, you mean you me just
[54:24] tell you I believe every word matters.
[54:26] How many believes that every word of God
[54:28] matters? That's why that's why the book
[54:29] of Revelation would say that every man
[54:31] that would hear the words of this
[54:33] prophecy if he would add anything to it,
[54:35] I would add unto him the plagues that
[54:37] are in this book. Or if any man would
[54:39] take away from the words of the book of
[54:41] this prophecy, God shall take away his
[54:44] part out of the book of life. I I
[54:46] believe that every word matters. How
[54:48] many believes that tonight? I believe
[54:49] every word matters. It matters to God
[54:52] and it matters to the believer. I I
[54:54] believe every word has the ability to
[54:56] transform somebody's life. It it can
[54:58] change the course of your life. A matter
[55:00] of fact, Jesus said, "Whosoever speaketh
[55:02] a word against the son of man, it'll be
[55:04] forgiven him. But any man that would
[55:06] speak against the Holy Ghost, it shall
[55:08] not be forgiven him, neither in this
[55:10] world or neither in the world to come.
[55:12] My what a powerful thought tonight. How
[55:14] careful that we must be because one word
[55:17] against the Holy Ghost was enough to
[55:19] never be forgiven. One word is what
[55:21] caused the fall in the Garden of Eden.
[55:23] But you know, I thought about it. If one
[55:25] word is enough to bring death and one
[55:27] word is enough to bring destruction and
[55:29] one word is enough to cause somebody to
[55:32] have eternal damnation, then what about
[55:34] if one word could give life? What what
[55:36] about a word of God that could bring
[55:38] forth life in a time of trouble?
[55:40] Friends, let me tell you tonight, every
[55:42] word of God is a seed that has the
[55:44] ability to bring forth life. Somebody
[55:47] say, "Amen."
[55:48] &gt;&gt; Every word of God has the ability to
[55:50] bring forth life.
[55:52] That's when we come to church and we
[55:54] begin to cry out to God. Just one word,
[55:56] Lord. Speak to my trouble, Lord. You
[55:58] know what I have need of, Lord. Just
[56:00] speak one word to my trial. Lord, speak
[56:02] one word, Lord, to my situation that my
[56:04] faith might be restored. I I just need
[56:06] one word, Lord, that my sickness would
[56:08] be healed. I I need one word that my
[56:10] family would be brought back together,
[56:12] Lord. That you could restore us.
[56:15] &gt;&gt; One word of God.
[56:16] &gt;&gt; You know why you have that kind of a
[56:17] draw? Because the seed is in God's word.
[56:21] But let me ask you a question tonight.
[56:23] What good would a seed do if it was
[56:24] never sown?
[56:25] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[56:26] &gt;&gt; Isaiah said the word of God is seed to
[56:29] the swer. So if there's going to be a
[56:31] seed, there has to be somebody to sew
[56:33] the seed. Jesus says this in a parable
[56:35] in Matthew the 13th chapter. He said,
[56:37] "Behold, a swer went forth to sew.
[56:41] And when he sowed, some seeds fell by
[56:42] the wayside. Fowls came and devoured
[56:45] them. Some fell on stony places. They
[56:47] didn't have much earth. And when they
[56:48] sprung up, because they had no deepness
[56:50] of earth, when the sun was up, they were
[56:52] scorched because they had no root, they
[56:54] withered away. But some fell among
[56:56] thorns, and the thorns sprung up, and it
[56:57] choked them. But others fell unto good
[57:00] ground and brought forth fruit, some
[57:02] hundred, some 60fold, and some 30fold.
[57:05] And Jesus said, "But hear ye therefore
[57:07] the parable of the swer." So he made
[57:09] sure that no longer was it a parable,
[57:11] but it was made known. He said when
[57:13] anyone heareth the word of the kingdom
[57:16] and he understand it not then he then
[57:18] cometh the wicked one and he catches
[57:20] away that which has been sown in his
[57:22] heart. This is he that received the word
[57:25] by the wayside. So he received a word
[57:27] but he didn't understand what he
[57:29] received. And so and then when the enemy
[57:31] come he was able to take that seed away
[57:34] from the one the birds would come and
[57:35] they would eat it. It was able to take
[57:37] it away out of his heart. He said, "But
[57:38] then there was another one whose seed
[57:40] was received on the stony places." He
[57:42] said, "He's the same one that when he
[57:44] would hear the word of God, he would
[57:46] rejoice and hear it." And friends, I no
[57:48] doubt we hear that so many times. Every
[57:50] time when the word goes forth, we all
[57:52] rejoice. There's something about us that
[57:54] rejoices at the word of God. There's
[57:56] something about us that causes us to
[57:57] say, "Amen." There's something about us
[57:59] that causes us to shout when we hear
[58:01] something that God speaks to us that
[58:03] that that that quickens our heart. But
[58:05] it can't just be a quickening in the or
[58:09] something that just happened in a
[58:10] service. It can't just be a revival on
[58:12] the surface. But there had to be
[58:14] something to it cuz brother or or Jesus
[58:17] said he said when he receives this, he
[58:19] receives it. But because he don't
[58:20] meditate on it and because he don't
[58:22] study on it, he may have rejoiced when
[58:24] he heard it. He may have shouted the
[58:26] building down. He he may have got so
[58:28] excited about the word of God, but he
[58:29] don't meditate on the word. He don't
[58:31] study on the word. He don't lay in it.
[58:33] It's just a service revelation, he said.
[58:35] And now it has no real root in him. It's
[58:38] temporary and it only lasts a little
[58:40] while because when affliction comes and
[58:42] trouble and persecution comes on account
[58:45] of the word, then all of a sudden he
[58:47] stumbles and he begins to distrust and
[58:50] desert the one that he ought to trust
[58:52] and obey because he didn't study on it
[58:54] and because he didn't meditate on it.
[58:56] And Jesus said, "And then he shall fall
[58:58] away." He said, "But then there was one
[59:00] that received the seed among the
[59:01] thorns." He said that hearth the word.
[59:03] He said, "And those thorns are the cares
[59:05] of the world and the deceitfulness of
[59:07] riches." I could preach an hour on the
[59:09] deceitfulness of riches. You know why?
[59:11] Because it is a deceit there. There's
[59:13] nothing you could ever chase in this
[59:15] life that you would ever get to the end
[59:16] of the road that you could prop your
[59:18] feet up and say, "I finally got what I
[59:20] was after." It's a carrot that you can
[59:21] never reach. It's something that it'll
[59:23] never satisfy you. He said, "But
[59:25] whenever you it falls among the thorns,
[59:27] but when you get wrapped up in the cares
[59:29] of the world and the deceitfulness of
[59:30] riches, it chokes the word and it
[59:33] becomes unfruitful." He said, "But then,
[59:35] and what about he that receive seed into
[59:37] good ground and he hears the word and he
[59:40] understands it and it bears fruit, can I
[59:42] just say it like this? When he hears the
[59:44] word, he meditates on it. He studies on
[59:47] it. He feeds on it. He takes it to
[59:49] heart. Brother Mark, he reads on it. He
[59:51] prays about it. He's meditating on the
[59:53] word day and night. And when he bears
[59:55] fruit and brings forth, it'll bring
[59:57] forth and produce some hundred, some 60,
[59:59] some 30. I think this is a powerful
[1:00:02] scripture. Jesus is showing us what
[1:00:04] happens when the seed of the word of God
[1:00:06] falls on hearts. But let me tell you
[1:00:08] something. Regardless of the outcome of
[1:00:10] the seed, there's some of that that look
[1:00:12] really that look really bad because the
[1:00:13] seed lay there and and many of us, you
[1:00:16] could think about people in our life
[1:00:17] that that that they had had a seed of
[1:00:19] the word or something that had fell on
[1:00:21] them, but then they would go by the
[1:00:22] wayside. And so we we've all seen or
[1:00:24] been able to bear witness of this very
[1:00:27] thing that Jesus is speaking of. But you
[1:00:29] know, I thought about it as I read it
[1:00:30] that regardless of the outcome of the
[1:00:33] seed that all of the seed was sown by a
[1:00:36] swer. This is what brought me to this
[1:00:37] tonight. He said that's and brother said
[1:00:39] that's what you're doing. See, whenever
[1:00:41] whenever you come to preach the word of
[1:00:43] God, he said we're only responsible for
[1:00:45] sewing seeds. Some fell by the wayside.
[1:00:47] I know I know people want you to do much
[1:00:50] more as a preacher. They they want you
[1:00:51] to fix all their problems and they they
[1:00:53] want you to come to the house and and
[1:00:54] get everything straightened up and get
[1:00:56] everybody lined up. But said, "We're
[1:00:58] only responsible for sewing seeds." He
[1:01:00] said, "But some fell by the wayside.
[1:01:02] Some fell on different kinds of ground.
[1:01:04] Some fell over and brought a hundfold."
[1:01:06] He said, "But we are just seed swowers."
[1:01:08] Somebody say seed sers. He said, "We're
[1:01:10] seed swers, but it's God is the one that
[1:01:13] directs it when it's falling." See,
[1:01:15] that's what we're doing tonight, brother
[1:01:16] Mah, is we're sewing seeds. That's why
[1:01:18] God calls me into the pull pit. He calls
[1:01:21] him to sew the seed of the word and then
[1:01:23] it's God that takes the seed and God
[1:01:26] determines where it falls and what kind
[1:01:28] of heart that it's fallen in. He said,
[1:01:29] "But we just keep sewing the seed." You
[1:01:31] know what? You know, I think about the
[1:01:32] devil in this age. I I thought what an
[1:01:34] evil spirit that we have today because
[1:01:36] the devil does all that he can to
[1:01:39] disrupt the program of God. But you know
[1:01:41] what? The devil has found out that you
[1:01:42] can't get a believer to disbelieve the
[1:01:44] word of God. That's what happened with
[1:01:46] Eve. But you can't do it today because
[1:01:48] they're going to believe the word. So
[1:01:49] let me I may as well just preach.
[1:01:51] Somebody say, "Pastor, I believe I
[1:01:53] will." This is what happens today. It
[1:01:55] sometimes is what happens is that Satan
[1:01:57] instead of attacking the word, brother
[1:01:59] Mah, what he has done is he has turned
[1:02:01] his attack on the swer that is sewing
[1:02:03] the seed. If he can't discredit the seed
[1:02:05] and he can't discredit the word to keep
[1:02:07] you from receiving it, then the next
[1:02:09] thing he's going to do is discredit the
[1:02:11] swer that is sewing it so that you don't
[1:02:13] receive the seed at all. I thought,
[1:02:14] isn't that just like the devil? It would
[1:02:16] cause people to come up. They judge
[1:02:18] every ministry. They get hateful about
[1:02:20] the people that God brings in the pull
[1:02:22] pit. They some they want to hear and
[1:02:23] some, "Well, you may as well preach
[1:02:25] anyway. It's the truth." Some they want
[1:02:26] to hear and some they don't want to hear
[1:02:28] and they're pretty obvious to let you
[1:02:30] know about it. They get hateful and
[1:02:32] critical in their spirit. What is it?
[1:02:33] It's the spirit of the devil that's
[1:02:35] attacking the swer that is sewing the
[1:02:38] seed. But friends, let me just say this
[1:02:40] to you tonight. As long as the seed
[1:02:42] that's being sown is a good seed, then
[1:02:45] why would we attack the swer? Isn't that
[1:02:47] what really matters? As long as the seed
[1:02:49] that is being sown Oh, I know. I I know
[1:02:51] how it is. Well, y'all may as well just
[1:02:53] let me preach. I I know how it is that
[1:02:55] Well, I don't like the way he sws. You
[1:02:56] know, he gets a little bit too loud when
[1:02:58] he sws and I I don't like how he gets so
[1:03:00] loud. And that one he Well, he just sews
[1:03:02] too slow, so I can't stand to listen to
[1:03:04] him. And that one, he sws too fast and I
[1:03:07] can't stand to listen to him. And that
[1:03:08] one he sews too quiet. So I can't stand
[1:03:11] to listen to him. But friends, let me
[1:03:12] tell you, as long as the seed is being
[1:03:14] sown, isn't that what matters?
[1:03:17] &gt;&gt; Isn't that what matters? I I don't I
[1:03:19] don't like the way he preaches. He just
[1:03:20] kind of slings it out there. He preaches
[1:03:22] so fast, I can't understand what he
[1:03:24] says. I don't like the way he preaches.
[1:03:26] He preaches so quiet and it's so
[1:03:28] negative. It's so positive. It's so
[1:03:30] this. It's so that. Why? It's a constant
[1:03:32] attack on the sewer. And it gets her
[1:03:34] mind off of the seed that God is trying
[1:03:37] to bring to the church.
[1:03:39] &gt;&gt; Say, see, so I think what we need to do
[1:03:41] tonight is be less concerned with the
[1:03:43] swer and more concerned with the seed.
[1:03:44] Hello.
[1:03:47] &gt;&gt; That's the gospel truth anyway.
[1:03:49] &gt;&gt; We need to be less concerned with the
[1:03:50] swer and more concerned with what's
[1:03:53] being sold.
[1:03:54] &gt;&gt; I tell you what the prophet said. He
[1:03:56] prayed for them. He said, "Oh God,
[1:03:58] anoint your ministers aresh." This ought
[1:04:00] to be our heart. God, anoint your
[1:04:02] ministers aresh. Lord, may we get out
[1:04:04] into the field with the word and plant
[1:04:06] the real word. If there's no word,
[1:04:08] there's no seed sowed that there'll be
[1:04:10] no harvest. But give us strength now
[1:04:13] while it is day that we might sew the
[1:04:15] seed of life into this dying and
[1:04:17] perishing millions. That was the prayer
[1:04:19] of a prophet of God. Friends, I think
[1:04:21] that ought to be our prayer tonight.
[1:04:23] Lord, let the ministers of the word,
[1:04:25] Lord, may I do something to be a help to
[1:04:27] them. Lord, may you strengthen them that
[1:04:28] they could bring forth the word of God.
[1:04:30] Lord, let the seed be sown to my heart.
[1:04:33] Lord, you know I have need of it. Lord,
[1:04:35] I want a harvest in my life. I want my
[1:04:37] life to manifest the word of God. So,
[1:04:39] Lord, I pray that when the Holy Ghost
[1:04:41] comes tonight, Lord, I pray the seed of
[1:04:43] God's word would be sown in my heart
[1:04:45] that I can manifest what you'd have me
[1:04:47] to be.
[1:04:49] &gt;&gt; Seed is sowed from the heart of every
[1:04:52] believer. We ought to pray for the swer
[1:04:55] that God would give him strength to sew.
[1:04:57] Let me tell you friends, I believe this.
[1:04:59] As long as he's sewing good seed, that's
[1:05:00] what really matters.
[1:05:02] &gt;&gt; Hello, somebody. Isn't that Shouldn't
[1:05:03] that be our heart? As long as it's good
[1:05:05] seed being sowed, that's what matter.
[1:05:07] Can Can I just say what Paul said? I
[1:05:08] didn't make this up. Paul said, "Some
[1:05:10] people preach Christ out of envy and
[1:05:12] strife, and some do it out of goodwill."
[1:05:14] In other words, some preach for a
[1:05:16] rivalry. In other words, they're trying
[1:05:17] to preach better than the next guy, and
[1:05:19] the next guy is trying to preach better
[1:05:20] than the next guy. Paul said, "Some
[1:05:22] preach for rivalry, but there are some
[1:05:24] that preach with a pure heart. Some are
[1:05:26] sincere." Can I go ahead and say it? And
[1:05:28] some are insincere. Some preach for
[1:05:30] personal gain. Some preach for fame.
[1:05:33] Some really want to give. He said, "But
[1:05:35] what then?" In every way, whether in
[1:05:37] pretense or in truth, he says, "Still
[1:05:40] yet, I rejoice because Christ is being
[1:05:43] preached."
[1:05:45] &gt;&gt; It don't matter what the purpose of. It
[1:05:46] don't matter what the reason was. That
[1:05:48] ain't mine to judge. But what I know is
[1:05:50] as long as the word of God is being
[1:05:53] sold, I know I can get something out of
[1:05:55] it. I believe that ought to be our
[1:05:56] purpose. I I wish I was more like Paul,
[1:05:58] but as long as God as Christ is being
[1:06:00] preached, I can rejoice. I wonder how
[1:06:02] many say amen tonight. As long as Christ
[1:06:05] is being preached, I can rejoice. That's
[1:06:08] a true son of God. He He rejoices when
[1:06:10] the gospel's preached. A true son of
[1:06:12] God, friends, let me tell you this.
[1:06:14] There's never been a time that the
[1:06:16] gospel was preached that there wasn't a
[1:06:18] cause for rejoicing. There's never a
[1:06:20] word of God that's gone forth it wasn't
[1:06:22] a reason to say amen. There's never been
[1:06:24] a time that the word of God has been
[1:06:26] spoken. Brother Mark, it didn't give us
[1:06:27] a reason to say amen. Hallelujah. Thank
[1:06:30] you, Lord. Every time God's word is
[1:06:32] preached, there ought to be something on
[1:06:34] the inside of us that says amen to the
[1:06:36] word of God.
[1:06:38] &gt;&gt; We believe it.
[1:06:39] &gt;&gt; I believe every time the gospel of Jesus
[1:06:41] Christ goes forth, it brings liberty to
[1:06:44] the church.
[1:06:45] &gt;&gt; Oh, friends, let me tell you, that's why
[1:06:47] that's why we get in there and have
[1:06:48] church because the gospel trumpet is
[1:06:50] sounded tonight. It's a gospel. It's a
[1:06:52] It's a sound of freedom. It's the sound
[1:06:54] of of liberty. It's the trumpet of
[1:06:57] Jubilee. You You remember those slaves
[1:06:58] in the old days, what they were waiting
[1:07:00] on that they had been in bondage so
[1:07:02] long, Brother Mark? They just got tired
[1:07:03] of being bound down. They got tired of
[1:07:05] being held down by theology and the way
[1:07:08] that people think and the way that they
[1:07:10] that people wanted them to be. And
[1:07:11] finally, they just had to get away
[1:07:13] somewhere where they were waiting on
[1:07:15] that 50th year to come. And then one day
[1:07:17] they heard the sounding of that Jubilee
[1:07:19] trumpet and something happened on on the
[1:07:21] inside of them said, "I may not be able
[1:07:23] to see the paper. I may not have the
[1:07:25] proclamation, but I've heard the trumpet
[1:07:27] sound. It's a sound of freedom. It gives
[1:07:30] liberty to the church." I believe that's
[1:07:33] what we have tonight. I thank God for
[1:07:35] the liberty to preach the gospel. I
[1:07:37] thank God for the liberty to worship
[1:07:39] God. I thank God for the liberty to say
[1:07:41] amen. I thank God for the liberty to
[1:07:43] speak what's on our heart and be a
[1:07:45] believer.
[1:07:47] &gt;&gt; We have liberty in the house of God.
[1:07:50] &gt;&gt; We just love the Lord. We have liberty.
[1:07:52] It's the sound of freedom has been
[1:07:54] sounded. This is what Jesus came to do.
[1:07:57] He didn't come to bind you. He came to
[1:07:58] set you free. Amen, somebody.
[1:08:01] &gt;&gt; You boys believe that Jesus didn't come
[1:08:03] to bind you. He come to set you free.
[1:08:05] Ezekiel, he didn't mean for you to live
[1:08:06] your whole life bound by spirits when
[1:08:08] you go to school and have to be
[1:08:09] tormented by the devil and you don't
[1:08:11] have a way out. He came to set you free
[1:08:13] that you had somewhere to turn. Right
[1:08:15] when you're walking down the hallways,
[1:08:16] right when you're sitting there with
[1:08:18] your friends and they're saying things
[1:08:19] that they ought to say, but something
[1:08:21] causes you to turn away. He came to set
[1:08:23] you free.
[1:08:25] &gt;&gt; He didn't come for us to be bound. He
[1:08:26] freed you from bondage. You say, "Well,
[1:08:27] what bondage?" It don't matter what the
[1:08:29] bondage is. He made you free. Somebody
[1:08:31] say, "He made me free." Amen.
[1:08:34] &gt;&gt; Bible says, "Whom the Son has set free
[1:08:36] is free indeed."
[1:08:37] &gt;&gt; Somebody say it again. He made me free
[1:08:39] &gt;&gt; from sickness. He made me free
[1:08:42] &gt;&gt; from spiritual bondage. He made me free
[1:08:44] from from from from torment. He made me
[1:08:47] free from church bondage. He made me
[1:08:49] free from a priest, from a bishop, from
[1:08:51] a from a from a pastor, from a pope. It
[1:08:54] don't matter what it is that had you
[1:08:55] bound, but Jesus came to set you free.
[1:08:59] &gt;&gt; Said he made me free. The gospel trumpet
[1:09:02] is sounded. He's a liberator. He was
[1:09:04] sent to set the captives free. The sound
[1:09:06] of freedom has been sounded in this
[1:09:08] sage. I believe that friends, let me
[1:09:09] tell you, if you want good seed, then
[1:09:11] let the serow. I think we need to get
[1:09:14] get out of the way of the sewer and let
[1:09:15] the serow. Say, Lord, won't you just
[1:09:17] pour it out on me, Lord? You know what I
[1:09:19] have need of, Lord. Let let don't
[1:09:21] restrict the sewing. Let Lord give it to
[1:09:23] me as you see fit.
[1:09:25] &gt;&gt; We don't do away with the sers.
[1:09:28] &gt;&gt; We love the sers. Because without the
[1:09:30] sewer there be no seed. Without the seed
[1:09:33] there be no harvest.
[1:09:35] &gt;&gt; The word is seed to the sewer. But that
[1:09:37] ain't all it was. Isaiah said, "But it
[1:09:39] was also bread."
[1:09:42] &gt;&gt; You know, the Bible says whenever God's
[1:09:44] children, they were always promised
[1:09:46] bread. I love how David writes this
[1:09:48] because he said, "I've been young and
[1:09:49] now I'm old." He said, "But two things
[1:09:50] I've never seen. I've never seen the
[1:09:52] righteous forsaken and I've never seen
[1:09:54] God's children begging bread."
[1:09:56] God has always provided for his children
[1:09:58] all the way back in the book of Exodus
[1:10:00] when you hear of Israel, brother Mark,
[1:10:02] when they left out of the land of of
[1:10:04] Egypt and they were wandering out in the
[1:10:06] wilderness and they got all to this
[1:10:07] place and felt like that God had
[1:10:09] forsaken them and here they were going
[1:10:11] to starve out in the wilderness and
[1:10:12] remember they got to murmuring and
[1:10:13] complaining to Moses saying, "Hey, we
[1:10:15] got out here so far. What was the
[1:10:16] purpose of bringing us here? You could
[1:10:18] have left us in Egypt. We could have
[1:10:19] died in there. At least we had food to
[1:10:21] eat. At least we had bread to eat. We
[1:10:23] had meat in our pots. You know, you
[1:10:25] could have just left us there to die,
[1:10:26] but it said you brought us all the way
[1:10:28] out in the wilderness to die in the
[1:10:29] wilderness. But here, whenever God would
[1:10:32] speak to Moses, he said, "But behold, I
[1:10:34] will send bread from heaven for you."
[1:10:38] &gt;&gt; And the Bible says, "For their entire
[1:10:39] journey," I think this is so good, for
[1:10:41] their entire journey, they were fed
[1:10:44] &gt;&gt; in the natural. Their entire journey,
[1:10:46] God gave them exactly what they had need
[1:10:48] of. But I love what what Moses said in
[1:10:50] Deuteronomy the 8th chapter, but he went
[1:10:52] from the natural to the spiritual. He
[1:10:53] said, "But man shall not live by bread
[1:10:55] alone, but by every word that proceedth
[1:10:58] out of the mouth of God." So here he
[1:11:00] establishes all the way back in
[1:11:01] Deuteronomy that the word of God becomes
[1:11:04] bread. In other words, it's something
[1:11:06] that you can feed on. 1500 years later,
[1:11:09] Jesus is talking to the Jews that were
[1:11:11] following him. Remember when they
[1:11:12] followed him from the these were those
[1:11:14] that were at uh at the the sea there
[1:11:17] when Jesus had turned uh two fish and
[1:11:19] five loaves of bread into feeding 5,000.
[1:11:22] the these were those that were there.
[1:11:24] They had they had witnessed the
[1:11:25] supernatural. They saw the bread
[1:11:27] multiplied and the 5,000 were fed. In
[1:11:30] fact, they were actually those that had
[1:11:32] tasted the literal bread that Jesus had
[1:11:34] created. So here out of the hand of the
[1:11:36] creator, he was tearing off bread. These
[1:11:38] were those that had tasted that bread
[1:11:40] and they followed him and they we begin
[1:11:43] to call on him, "Master, where have you
[1:11:44] been? We we've been looking for you." Oh
[1:11:46] my. They were such great followers. But
[1:11:48] Jesus said to them, he said, 'You seek
[1:11:50] me not because you saw miracles. He
[1:11:52] said, ' But you're seeking me because
[1:11:54] you ate of the loaves and you were
[1:11:55] filled. Said, see, so listen now Jesus
[1:11:58] began to rebuke them. Here you say,
[1:12:00] well, they were following Jesus, but
[1:12:01] they weren't coming for the right
[1:12:02] reason. So here he rebuked them. I I
[1:12:05] thought about this of, you know, why
[1:12:06] would he rebuke them? You realize what
[1:12:08] they had done? Because they were
[1:12:09] following after him after they had
[1:12:11] received some free bread. I thought,
[1:12:13] isn't it something? In other words, they
[1:12:14] had taken on the position of a beggar.
[1:12:16] They were following after him. Well,
[1:12:18] Lord, where have you been? We've been
[1:12:19] looking all over for you. Why? You
[1:12:21] wasn't over on the other side of the
[1:12:22] sea. We followed you over here. See,
[1:12:24] they took the position of a beggar. And
[1:12:26] Jesus begins to rebuke them or or to
[1:12:28] rebuke them. And he shows us something
[1:12:30] that that's not the reason that we serve
[1:12:32] God. We don't serve God for gain. We
[1:12:35] don't give offerings for gain. We don't
[1:12:36] give tithing for gain. We don't come to
[1:12:39] church for gain. We're not trying to be
[1:12:40] a whiff. That ain't our purpose of
[1:12:42] serving God. It ain't trying to
[1:12:43] establish the flesh. But Jesus actually
[1:12:46] corrects them. He says, "This is not the
[1:12:48] attitude of the children of God." So he
[1:12:50] begins to show them what a real son of
[1:12:52] God is. He says, "See, labor not for the
[1:12:56] meat that perish, but for the meat which
[1:12:58] endures to everlasting life, which the
[1:13:01] son of man shall give unto you." So he
[1:13:04] corrects their labor. Don't don't do all
[1:13:06] of this for meat that's going to go
[1:13:08] away, but labor for some spiritual food.
[1:13:10] There's got to be something that'll
[1:13:12] sustain you. He said, "Put some effort
[1:13:13] in to some spiritual food. Put some
[1:13:15] labor in." I see. That's the problem
[1:13:17] today. Why people don't get don't get
[1:13:19] anywhere with God. They don't put any
[1:13:20] labor in for spiritual there. They don't
[1:13:22] put any work in for spiritual food.
[1:13:24] They, you know, I Well, I may as well
[1:13:25] say it. Y'all ain't going to quit on me
[1:13:27] anyway, but because y'all's good people.
[1:13:28] But but whenever when people come to the
[1:13:30] house of God, sometimes they just expect
[1:13:32] everybody to feed them. They They expect
[1:13:34] the preacher to do his job and the song
[1:13:36] leader to do his job and the musician to
[1:13:38] do their job, but they don't want to do
[1:13:39] their job. See? See? I think every one
[1:13:41] of us have a role in the house of God.
[1:13:44] And Jesus said we have to labor for meat
[1:13:46] that that endures. We ought to labor for
[1:13:49] meat that endures unto everlasting life
[1:13:51] that the son of man shall give unto you.
[1:13:55] &gt;&gt; But you know how they answered? They
[1:13:57] answered, brother Joe, they said, "Well,
[1:13:58] our fathers ate mana in the desert and
[1:14:00] as it is written, he speaking to Moses
[1:14:03] gave gave them bread from heaven to
[1:14:05] eat." But Jesus said, "No, Moses didn't
[1:14:07] give you bread from heaven to eat. The
[1:14:09] one that gave you bread from heaven was
[1:14:11] my father.
[1:14:12] &gt;&gt; He gave you bread from heaven. He gave
[1:14:14] you a true bread from heaven. And the
[1:14:16] bread of God, he watch how he shows
[1:14:19] this. He says the bread of God is he
[1:14:21] which cometh down from heaven and giveth
[1:14:24] life unto the world. So here Jesus, he
[1:14:26] actually shows them that the bread of
[1:14:28] God is the person of Jesus Christ.
[1:14:31] &gt;&gt; See, it's not just a it's not just a
[1:14:34] something that you can touch with your
[1:14:35] hands. It's not it's not it's not this
[1:14:37] natural food, but the bread of God is
[1:14:39] he. It's a person that cometh down from
[1:14:41] heaven. Well, they said to him, "Well,
[1:14:43] Lord, won't you give us this bread?" And
[1:14:44] Jesus answered, he said, "I am the bread
[1:14:47] of life. And he that cometh to me shall
[1:14:50] never hunger, and he that believeth on
[1:14:52] me shall never thirst." You know what he
[1:14:54] done after that, brother brother Tim? He
[1:14:56] went to preaching a message on
[1:14:58] lifegiving bread. He went to preaching
[1:15:00] about an everlasting bread. There's a
[1:15:02] bread of eternal life. There's one bread
[1:15:04] that can sustain you. There's one bread
[1:15:06] that can make you whole. There's one
[1:15:08] bread that could fill you beyond being
[1:15:10] full. There's one bread that can satisfy
[1:15:12] your soul. There is a bread that's sent
[1:15:14] down from heaven. And as he began to
[1:15:16] speak on that bread, he said, "And I am
[1:15:19] that bread of life."
[1:15:21] &gt;&gt; Your fathers ate mana in the wilderness,
[1:15:23] but they died from the mana that they
[1:15:25] ate. But I'm talking about a bread that
[1:15:28] you can eat on tonight that you will
[1:15:29] never die, but you'll have an
[1:15:31] everlasting life. If you can ever turn
[1:15:33] your heart to feed upon the bread of
[1:15:35] life, it was he that cometh down in the
[1:15:37] wilderness. That same he that come
[1:15:39] present in the midst of Leodysia. If you
[1:15:42] can turn your heart to feed on that
[1:15:44] bread, you'll never die, but you'll have
[1:15:46] eternal life.
[1:15:48] &gt;&gt; He says, the bread that cometh down from
[1:15:49] heaven, I am the living bread which came
[1:15:52] down from heaven. And if any man have to
[1:15:53] eat this bread, he shall live forever.
[1:15:57] &gt;&gt; I love how Jesus said this. He said,
[1:15:58] "And the bread that I will give is my
[1:16:02] flesh,
[1:16:03] &gt;&gt; which I will give for the life of this
[1:16:05] world." I thought, isn't that isn't that
[1:16:07] a an odd way that he worded that? The
[1:16:09] bread which I shall give is my flesh.
[1:16:12] Because, you know, when you read John
[1:16:13] the first chapter, the Bible says, "In
[1:16:15] the beginning was the word. The word was
[1:16:18] with God. The word was God. And then the
[1:16:21] word became flesh which was Jesus. And
[1:16:25] notice what Jesus says then he says he
[1:16:27] says the word became flesh. Bram said he
[1:16:29] came down from glory and he became man.
[1:16:31] Therefore born without sex he created
[1:16:34] himself a body that he lived in. Emanuel
[1:16:36] God represented with us. The word made
[1:16:39] flesh among us and he lived with us to
[1:16:41] redeem many sons back to God through the
[1:16:44] shedding of his blood. But he realized
[1:16:46] that that wasn't the end of the story.
[1:16:47] Jesus's story didn't end at the cross.
[1:16:49] Hello somebody. It's a wonderful story.
[1:16:52] I I love the story of Calvary. But his
[1:16:54] story didn't end at the cross. He said,
[1:16:56] "But see when he when he went to the
[1:16:58] cross, the word had became flesh. That
[1:17:00] was what was walking around. The word
[1:17:03] became flesh. That was what was hung
[1:17:04] upon the cross of Calvary." He said,
[1:17:06] "But see what happened is that word,
[1:17:08] that same Jesus, he said, but the bread
[1:17:11] that I will give is my flesh." So here
[1:17:14] the very thing that had became flesh. No
[1:17:16] wonder Jesus said what the the bread
[1:17:18] that I'll give you is my flesh. He was
[1:17:20] speaking of a word. He was speaking of
[1:17:22] what came out of God in the very
[1:17:24] beginning that had came spoken down
[1:17:26] through the mouth of the prophets and
[1:17:28] had became flesh in that day. And now
[1:17:30] Jesus said, "And the word that or the
[1:17:32] the bread that I will give is my flesh."
[1:17:34] In other words, the bread is the word
[1:17:36] that came from God. But Abraham said the
[1:17:38] body sure was Christ. It was the
[1:17:41] anointed one. He said, "If Christ means
[1:17:43] the anointed one, he's the same
[1:17:45] yesterday, today, and forever." And he
[1:17:47] is the word and the word is the
[1:17:50] anointing. He said, "If you abide in me
[1:17:52] and my word in you and in what you ask,
[1:17:54] what you will," he said, "See, it's the
[1:17:56] word of God, the anointed word, that's
[1:17:58] what does it." So the word of God that
[1:18:01] became flesh. Then Jesus said, "The
[1:18:03] bread that I give you is my flesh, which
[1:18:05] was the word." So in other words, to
[1:18:07] feed on the bread of life is to feed on
[1:18:10] the anointed word of God.
[1:18:13] &gt;&gt; Rebel said it was the anointed word.
[1:18:14] That's why he was called Christ because
[1:18:16] he was anointed. So in order to feed on
[1:18:18] the bread of life is feeding on the
[1:18:20] anointed word of God. That that's the
[1:18:22] that that fulfills the very scripture
[1:18:24] that Jesus said, the bread that I give
[1:18:26] is my flesh. See, we walk around well
[1:18:28] maybe that we have to get a wafer then
[1:18:30] then we're then we're eating on it.
[1:18:31] maybe only in a only in a communion
[1:18:33] service, then then we're eating on it.
[1:18:35] Cuz you know, maybe that that that be
[1:18:36] all kinds of things that men make it.
[1:18:38] But the reality is is if you're feeding
[1:18:40] on the anointed word of God, you're
[1:18:43] fulfilling the scripture that Jesus just
[1:18:45] spoke.
[1:18:46] &gt;&gt; The bread that I give is my flesh. So,
[1:18:49] see, it's the word. It's the anointed
[1:18:50] word. That's what does it. So, see,
[1:18:52] every word of God, how many believes
[1:18:54] this? Every word of God is an anointed
[1:18:55] word.
[1:18:57] &gt;&gt; Every word is lifegiving. Every word is
[1:19:00] life-changing. That means there's no big
[1:19:02] words and there's no little words.
[1:19:04] &gt;&gt; They all have the same power. There's no
[1:19:06] big sermons. There's no little sermons.
[1:19:08] All has the same power. That that's what
[1:19:10] made Christ anointed and that's what
[1:19:12] made you anointed is feeding upon the
[1:19:15] anointed word.
[1:19:16] &gt;&gt; See, that's why you don't sit under some
[1:19:18] denominational teaching because there's
[1:19:20] no anointed word to feed on. Believing
[1:19:22] some man-made creeds and laws that that
[1:19:24] men come up with. Well, they didn't come
[1:19:26] from God. They come out of the thoughts
[1:19:28] of man. This was the very thing that
[1:19:29] Isaiah was preaching. But he's talking
[1:19:31] about a word that came out of the mind
[1:19:33] of God. It came out of the thoughts of
[1:19:35] God. And whenever it comes forth, it's
[1:19:37] going to bring forth life. It's going to
[1:19:39] do something in the believer. It's going
[1:19:40] to have transforming power. It's going
[1:19:42] to be able to produce. It's going to
[1:19:44] bring forth. It's going to manifest the
[1:19:46] life of Jesus Christ.
[1:19:48] &gt;&gt; Anything from, see, anything from the
[1:19:50] mind of a man, it has a shelf life.
[1:19:52] &gt;&gt; But when it come out of the mind of God,
[1:19:54] can I just say it? It don't have an
[1:19:55] expiration date. The Bible said, the
[1:19:58] Bible said Jesus Christ is the same
[1:20:00] yesterday, today, and forever. That
[1:20:02] means this word of God today, you can
[1:20:04] read it some 2,000 years later. It has
[1:20:06] the same power that it did when it was
[1:20:08] written. It was just as good when it was
[1:20:11] written in the Bible as it is when you
[1:20:12] confess it out of your mouth. It's the
[1:20:14] same word with the same power. It has
[1:20:17] the same authority that it did when
[1:20:18] Jesus stood there and it condemned the
[1:20:20] devil that was that was tormenting men
[1:20:22] in that day. That same word has the same
[1:20:24] power today. And let me tell you, you
[1:20:28] may not recognize it, but the devil
[1:20:30] certainly does.
[1:20:32] &gt;&gt; You may not know that. You may not
[1:20:33] realize the power that the word of God
[1:20:36] has when you confess it, but I promise
[1:20:38] you, the devil realizes it.
[1:20:41] &gt;&gt; See, see, it's what God give us. I
[1:20:44] preached the rest of it. I may as well
[1:20:45] finish it. We got a minute.
[1:20:47] &gt;&gt; Can I ask you this? But what good is a
[1:20:51] bread without an eater?
[1:20:54] said, "The word of God was seed to the
[1:20:55] swer and bread to the eater." You know
[1:20:58] what an eater is? An eater is a person
[1:21:01] that consumes food.
[1:21:03] &gt;&gt; See, can I just Can I just say this? I'm
[1:21:05] I'm gonna have a good time for a minute.
[1:21:06] &gt;&gt; You know, coming to church don't make
[1:21:08] you an eater.
[1:21:10] &gt;&gt; You can sit here all night and all day
[1:21:12] for the next year, it don't make you an
[1:21:13] eater. Coming coming to church don't
[1:21:15] make you an eater. Sitting every week in
[1:21:17] the service and waiting on a blessing,
[1:21:18] it don't make you an eater. You can come
[1:21:20] to a table and never eat. I I promise
[1:21:22] you, I do it all the time. Every time my
[1:21:23] wife goes to a Chinese buffet, I'm not
[1:21:26] an eater. I come, I sit, I I I go
[1:21:29] through the motions, I talk to
[1:21:30] everybody, I I open the fortune cookie
[1:21:32] and all that, but I just don't eat it
[1:21:33] cuz I don't like it.
[1:21:35] &gt;&gt; See? So, I'm not an eater when it comes
[1:21:36] to Chinese. But you can come, but you
[1:21:39] can come all the time, but it don't make
[1:21:40] you an eater. See? So, so how do I get
[1:21:42] anywhere with God? Then you have to
[1:21:44] become an eater.
[1:21:46] &gt;&gt; See, you can't. And can I just tell you
[1:21:47] this? I This is free. You know, you
[1:21:49] can't eat with your mouth closed. See,
[1:21:51] your mouth has to be open. Try it. It's
[1:21:53] not It's not easy to do. You can't eat
[1:21:54] with your mouth closed. Your mouth has
[1:21:56] to be open in order to receive food.
[1:21:58] That I believe that's why that's why we
[1:21:59] come to the master's table. There's
[1:22:01] something in us that's reaching out.
[1:22:03] We're trying to get a hold of the bread
[1:22:04] of God. And the preacher start
[1:22:06] preaching, Brother Caleb. And something
[1:22:07] in me starts saying, "Amen. Give it to
[1:22:10] me straight. Just just lay down the
[1:22:11] word. Just preach the word of God.
[1:22:13] Preach it, brother. I I want to hear
[1:22:15] another word." What is it? Is you're
[1:22:17] feeding on the word of God. You're an
[1:22:19] eater.
[1:22:20] &gt;&gt; And an eater begins to pull from the
[1:22:22] gift of God because they have a desire
[1:22:24] to be fed. Can I can I just say this
[1:22:26] tonight? When you if you're going to
[1:22:27] come to the master's table and you want
[1:22:29] to be fed, brother Jonah, then what you
[1:22:31] have to do is you have to take your
[1:22:32] hands and reach out and get a hold of
[1:22:35] the bread that God has on the table and
[1:22:38] you have to put it in your mouth. Can I
[1:22:40] make it any planer? Nobody can force
[1:22:42] feed you. Nobody can make you swallow
[1:22:44] it. Nobody can make you take it. But you
[1:22:46] have to man up and woman up and be a
[1:22:48] believer and call out to God and say,
[1:22:50] "God, you know what I have need of and
[1:22:52] reach forth your hand and take the food,
[1:22:54] the bread of the word of God and feed
[1:22:56] yourself
[1:22:58] &gt;&gt; and draw strength from God's word."
[1:23:01] &gt;&gt; Let me tell you friends, that's why we
[1:23:02] come to the house of God with an
[1:23:03] expectation because we have to eat. We
[1:23:06] have to eat to be satisfied. We have to
[1:23:08] eat to be filled. You you we have to
[1:23:11] eat. Let me let me tell you, there's a
[1:23:12] lot of people that leaves the house of
[1:23:14] God hungry.
[1:23:19] &gt;&gt; Let that set in.
[1:23:21] &gt;&gt; There's a lot of people that leaves the
[1:23:23] house of God hungry. But you want me to
[1:23:25] tell you a secret? No eater ever leaves
[1:23:28] hungry.
[1:23:29] &gt;&gt; There's some people that leave hungry,
[1:23:31] but the eaters don't leave hungry.
[1:23:34] &gt;&gt; You see, the Bible said, "Blessed is he
[1:23:36] that hungers and thirsts after
[1:23:37] righteousness, for he shall be filled."
[1:23:40] So when we come in hungry, let me tell
[1:23:42] you what the Bible says. We can come in
[1:23:44] hungry, but we're going to go out field.
[1:23:45] But said, the ministers said they're
[1:23:48] sent to preach the word and you can hear
[1:23:50] the minister and and come to God through
[1:23:52] the minister's message. He said, but
[1:23:54] while the minister's preaching the word
[1:23:56] of God, the Holy Spirit that's in your
[1:23:58] heart will feed on the word of God.
[1:24:01] &gt;&gt; So the minister can say things, it can
[1:24:03] draw you to God. They it can paint a
[1:24:05] picture. What is the minister trying to
[1:24:07] do? The minister is trying to bring you
[1:24:09] to a place spiritually that you can
[1:24:11] feed, the Holy Spirit can feed upon the
[1:24:13] word of God. You know, friends, that's
[1:24:15] why that's why we are a spiritual
[1:24:16] church. That's why we try to get out of
[1:24:18] carnality and leave the things of the
[1:24:20] world behind. That's why we play music
[1:24:22] and and sing songs to create an
[1:24:24] atmosphere that the word of God can go
[1:24:26] forth because we don't want a carnal
[1:24:28] church. We are a spiritual church. We're
[1:24:30] a spiritual people. And I realize as a
[1:24:32] pastor that if you only come to church
[1:24:35] carnal and you only feed carnal and the
[1:24:37] preacher only preaches carnal, then
[1:24:39] ain't none of us ever going to get
[1:24:40] anywhere. But if you could ever get in
[1:24:42] the spirit and the preacher can get in
[1:24:44] the spirit and the hearer can get in the
[1:24:46] spirit and then and the singer can get
[1:24:47] in the spirit of God then the then the
[1:24:49] Holy Spirit can feed upon the word of
[1:24:52] God
[1:24:53] &gt;&gt; and things change in our life. So see
[1:24:56] when the word's preached, you know
[1:24:57] what's happening, brother Noah? What
[1:24:59] takes place? It's a spiritual communion
[1:25:01] between you and God.
[1:25:03] &gt;&gt; Absolutely.
[1:25:04] &gt;&gt; Anybody ever felt something, you know,
[1:25:06] you don't even know what it is, but you
[1:25:07] came in church, you just barely even got
[1:25:09] here and all of a sudden just a little
[1:25:10] bit of preaching or a little bit of the
[1:25:12] word going forth and all of a sudden it
[1:25:14] just gives you such a revival. Says,
[1:25:15] see, because it's spiritual communion
[1:25:17] and said, "When we come to the Lord's
[1:25:19] table, we must be in agreement with his
[1:25:22] word." So, in other words, if we want to
[1:25:23] get something out of it, we can't come
[1:25:25] to the table of the Lord with a critical
[1:25:27] spirit. We can't come looking for
[1:25:29] something wrong and and and oh boy, we
[1:25:31] got to hear this again. We can't come
[1:25:32] with that kind of a spirit and get
[1:25:34] anything from God. He said, "But when we
[1:25:36] come to the Lord's table, we must be in
[1:25:39] agreement with his word."
[1:25:41] &gt;&gt; So, we come to receive something from
[1:25:43] God. We come to commune. How many knows
[1:25:44] what it means to commune? Commune means
[1:25:47] to share one's intimate thoughts or
[1:25:49] feelings.
[1:25:50] So, see, so when we come to the house of
[1:25:52] God and we're feeding the word, we're
[1:25:55] hearing an anointed word of God. Brother
[1:25:57] Mark, it's being preached to us. We're
[1:25:59] literally hearing the intimate thoughts
[1:26:01] or the feelings of God.
[1:26:03] &gt;&gt; Isn't that powerful to think that God
[1:26:05] would care enough about you to bring an
[1:26:08] anointed word right in the the midst of
[1:26:10] the church, right? Whenever you felt
[1:26:11] like God had given up on you and there
[1:26:13] wasn't there was no hope and all all was
[1:26:15] lost. But but but when you hear the word
[1:26:17] going forth, you say, "Why does it why
[1:26:19] does it lift me so much?" It's because
[1:26:21] you're hearing the intimate thoughts or
[1:26:23] the feelings of God about your life. He
[1:26:26] knows exactly what we have need of.
[1:26:28] That's why I That's why we trust. That's
[1:26:30] why we protect the pull pit. We don't we
[1:26:32] don't just allow everybody that wants to
[1:26:34] preach come in the pullpit. And believe
[1:26:35] me, I get requests all the time
[1:26:39] in all sorts of ways of people that
[1:26:41] would love to come and and but but the
[1:26:43] reality is we just don't open the pull
[1:26:44] pit to everybody. We we there's some
[1:26:46] things in this church that are open to
[1:26:48] everybody. The altar is open to
[1:26:50] everybody. Our communion, it's open to
[1:26:52] everybody. But the pull pit, it's not
[1:26:53] open to everybody. It's only open as the
[1:26:57] Lord would see fit that the word of God
[1:26:59] could go forth. Although there's many
[1:27:00] great men, but it's our duty to protect
[1:27:03] the pullpit so that you as an eater and
[1:27:05] a believer can come in the house of God
[1:27:07] and have confidence in what's standing
[1:27:09] behind the desk.
[1:27:11] &gt;&gt; Not the man, but the word that's going
[1:27:12] forth.
[1:27:13] &gt;&gt; So, we protect the pull pit that you
[1:27:15] don't have to come to church guard and
[1:27:17] say, "I wonder what I'm going to hear
[1:27:18] tonight." You can come, you can just get
[1:27:20] ready. You can pray. You can get ready
[1:27:22] for service. You can come and kneel down
[1:27:24] at your chair. You can get ready for the
[1:27:26] word to come forth. You say, "Lord, I
[1:27:27] don't know who's preaching. I I don't
[1:27:29] know what's going to be said, but Lord,
[1:27:30] I know you've done proven it to me that
[1:27:32] I'm going to be blessed tonight. I'm
[1:27:34] going to be fed because I'm an eater.
[1:27:36] I'm coming with my mouth open and with
[1:27:38] my hand held out. I'm coming to draw
[1:27:40] from the word of God. I'm going to get
[1:27:41] something out of this service."
[1:27:43] &gt;&gt; And when you come that way, you go away
[1:27:46] filled.
[1:27:47] &gt;&gt; I think it it changes the way we think
[1:27:49] about coming to church.
[1:27:51] &gt;&gt; I love shouting. How many How many love
[1:27:53] shouting?
[1:27:54] &gt;&gt; I love singing. I love dancing in the
[1:27:56] spirit, but there's nothing greater than
[1:27:59] hearing the intimate thoughts or the
[1:28:01] feelings of God being expressed to your
[1:28:03] heart.
[1:28:04] &gt;&gt; I love worship. I love rejoicing. I But
[1:28:07] there's nothing greater to me than
[1:28:09] sitting I I I I don't just say this from
[1:28:11] a pullpit. I I'm the same way from my
[1:28:13] chair. Many people preaches in this pull
[1:28:16] pit. And I and I and I sit in the chair
[1:28:18] the same way. I'm a feeder. I'm a eater.
[1:28:20] I don't just sit there to make noise
[1:28:22] when they come out to preach. There's
[1:28:23] something in me that is drawing. Why?
[1:28:25] Because I want to be fed. I know there's
[1:28:26] souls that are in the building that need
[1:28:28] to be fed. And I'm trying to pull a gift
[1:28:30] of God that it could open up and feed
[1:28:32] the children of God.
[1:28:35] &gt;&gt; We need them kind of people.
[1:28:37] &gt;&gt; That's what we have to be. You say,
[1:28:38] "Brother Matt, well, we need some more."
[1:28:40] I'm just going to call them out. I may
[1:28:41] as well. We need some more Brother
[1:28:42] Brian's in the church. Well, be a
[1:28:44] brother Brian.
[1:28:46] &gt;&gt; It's okay. So, we need some more Brother
[1:28:47] Dave. We need We need some more Brother
[1:28:49] Joe's. We we need some We need some
[1:28:50] people, but you you can be just that.
[1:28:53] &gt;&gt; Let me tell you, you're an eater. How
[1:28:54] many is an eater? Raise your hand.
[1:28:56] &gt;&gt; How many you can eat with your mouth
[1:28:57] closed? But we're eaters. And so we
[1:29:00] begin to eat on the word of God. He
[1:29:01] said, "What are we doing, brother Matt?
[1:29:03] We ain't just making a show. We're not
[1:29:04] It ain't a pep rally. It's the word of
[1:29:06] God." And I know for a fact that if a
[1:29:08] people can ever draw from the word of
[1:29:10] God, it'll pull the spirit of God right
[1:29:12] into the building and God can speak to
[1:29:14] every single heart.
[1:29:16] &gt;&gt; That's what God is waiting. He's waiting
[1:29:19] on a hungry people that he can feed.
[1:29:21] Blessed is he that hungers
[1:29:24] and thirst after righteousness for he
[1:29:27] shall be filled. He that is desired to
[1:29:29] be filled, he shall be filled. So see it
[1:29:32] feeds our soul. Let me ask you this and
[1:29:35] I'm going to close. Let me use this and
[1:29:37] close.
[1:29:39] But what happens if you stop eating?
[1:29:43] You starve. Can I just say it? I was
[1:29:46] actually reading an article about this.
[1:29:48] I thought it was I thought it had some
[1:29:49] deep spiritual meaning. It was an
[1:29:51] article about natural starvation. Said,
[1:29:53] "What happens when a man doesn't eat for
[1:29:55] several days?" The first thing happens
[1:29:57] is his body becomes weak. Somebody say,
[1:29:59] "Amen."
[1:30:01] &gt;&gt; First thing is his body becomes weak.
[1:30:03] When he's faced with starvation, the
[1:30:05] body fights back. The first day without
[1:30:07] food is a lot like an overnight fast
[1:30:09] between dinner one night and breakfast
[1:30:10] the next morning. Energy levels are low.
[1:30:13] But whenever you come to eat breakfast,
[1:30:15] your energy level is picked up with a
[1:30:16] morning meal. That's what happens when
[1:30:19] you first start neglecting food. But
[1:30:21] just within a few days, faced with
[1:30:24] nothing to eat, the body begins feeding
[1:30:26] on itself. Friends, if I had time, I
[1:30:28] could preach on that a while.
[1:30:29] &gt;&gt; A few days without being fed, a few days
[1:30:32] with a people that that won't eat. You
[1:30:34] notice what happens? A body starts
[1:30:36] eating on. I thought, isn't that
[1:30:37] something? You take I you can tell
[1:30:38] somebody that ain't been feeding
[1:30:40] spiritually in a while because they come
[1:30:41] to Oh, God help me. But they come to
[1:30:43] church and the thing ain't on their mind
[1:30:45] about getting anywhere with God. The
[1:30:46] only thing on their mind is the person
[1:30:48] over on the other side. Well, I don't
[1:30:49] know why they're saying amen. They ain't
[1:30:51] got a right to say amen. I don't know
[1:30:52] why why they come in looking like that.
[1:30:54] Why they dress that way? Why they look
[1:30:55] that way? See, but they ain't ate in a
[1:30:57] while. And because you ain't ate in a
[1:30:59] while, then the body starts feeding on
[1:31:01] itself.
[1:31:02] &gt;&gt; This is just in the natural.
[1:31:04] &gt;&gt; You take it or leave it. said the body
[1:31:07] starts consuming the energy stores, the
[1:31:09] carbohydrates and the fats and the
[1:31:11] proteins and part of the tissue and it
[1:31:13] it starts consuming and after a while
[1:31:16] the stored energy goes away. Isn't that
[1:31:18] the way it is? Well, I don't have to go
[1:31:20] to church. I've got stored up, you know,
[1:31:22] after all I came to church enough. I can
[1:31:24] skip a few services because I've got
[1:31:26] enough stored up food. So, I'll just
[1:31:27] stay home and, you know, I've got some
[1:31:29] stored up and I'll survive. But let me
[1:31:30] tell you what the article said. is that
[1:31:32] and the first person in the family to
[1:31:34] die from starvation was not the parents.
[1:31:36] It was the children. You may have been
[1:31:38] stored up. You may have had enough to
[1:31:40] eat. You may have you you may have
[1:31:42] lasted a few services, but your kids
[1:31:44] your children don't have what you had.
[1:31:45] They ain't been they ain't listen to
[1:31:47] what you've listened to. They they may
[1:31:48] not have the the faith that you have.
[1:31:50] Said, "And if you and if you neglect to
[1:31:52] feed your children, your children will
[1:31:53] die quicker than the adult."
[1:31:56] &gt;&gt; So, see, we don't stay out to eat on
[1:31:59] stored up food. But when you start not
[1:32:02] eating, the metabolism slows. The body
[1:32:05] no longer can regulate its temperature.
[1:32:07] The kidney functions get impaired. The
[1:32:09] immune system weakens. And all of a
[1:32:11] sudden, because you stopped eating, then
[1:32:14] you're susceptible to sickness and
[1:32:16] disease
[1:32:17] &gt;&gt; and viruses, all these things that would
[1:32:20] come. Isn't that the way it is?
[1:32:22] &gt;&gt; Because you stopped eating and now
[1:32:24] anything that comes by, any old spirit
[1:32:26] that comes by, you're susceptible to it.
[1:32:29] where you used to wouldn't put up with
[1:32:30] that kind of conversations that people
[1:32:32] sit and talk about each other. You would
[1:32:34] used to wouldn't wouldn't enter into it
[1:32:35] at all, but because you stop eating and
[1:32:37] now your body is weak and now because
[1:32:39] you're weak, you're susceptible to any
[1:32:41] kind of old sickness that somebody else
[1:32:42] has. Your immune system gets low.
[1:32:46] &gt;&gt; I'm just preaching to you.
[1:32:48] &gt;&gt; Says, see, you're susceptible to
[1:32:50] sickness and disease. But then when the
[1:32:53] body uses its reserves to provide basic
[1:32:56] energy needs that that provides its
[1:32:58] basic energy needs, it can no longer
[1:33:00] supply the necessary nutrients to its
[1:33:02] vital organs and tissues. So first the
[1:33:05] body is eating on the reserves because
[1:33:07] it don't have food coming in. So it's
[1:33:09] eating on the reserves and and after it
[1:33:11] runs out of reserves to eat, it don't
[1:33:12] have the energy. Now it can't supply the
[1:33:15] nutrients. Now the vital organs start
[1:33:17] start uh being affected by this
[1:33:19] starvation. First thing that happens, it
[1:33:22] says the muscles begin to streng or or
[1:33:24] to shrink and the people become weak.
[1:33:27] &gt;&gt; But isn't that exactly the way? This is
[1:33:29] the way of starvation. It's the death of
[1:33:32] a starving man here. He had eat on his
[1:33:34] reserves long enough until there was no
[1:33:36] food coming into his mouth. And now he
[1:33:39] had ate all all that he could eat,
[1:33:40] brother Mark. And now after a few days,
[1:33:42] he starts getting weaker. And after a
[1:33:44] few days, the muscles start to strength.
[1:33:46] And now if he would try to strengthen
[1:33:47] them, the muscle's not even there that
[1:33:49] was there before because he starved it
[1:33:51] to death. And now he don't even have the
[1:33:53] muscle. It would shrink. Even the heart
[1:33:55] would shrink. The lungs would shrink. Uh
[1:33:57] the very muscles in the body would
[1:33:59] shrink until it would bring a weakness
[1:34:01] over the body. And then see the next
[1:34:04] thing would happen is the temperature of
[1:34:06] the body would drop and the person would
[1:34:08] come to a chill. Thought isn't that
[1:34:11] exactly
[1:34:12] &gt;&gt; what happens to a starving man? And now
[1:34:16] &gt;&gt; the flesh is weak.
[1:34:19] &gt;&gt; There's no strength in those muscles
[1:34:21] anymore. You were you used to have the
[1:34:24] fight. And used to have the the fight of
[1:34:26] faith. You could used to come to church
[1:34:27] on fire for God ready to just knock the
[1:34:30] devil out, but because somebody done
[1:34:31] knocked you out. You don't have the
[1:34:33] faith to eat or the strength to eat. And
[1:34:36] you starve yourself spiritually. And now
[1:34:38] you come to the house of God and now
[1:34:39] it's weaker by the day. Now our our our
[1:34:42] body gets weak. Our flesh gets weak. And
[1:34:45] then the heart starts to lose it. The
[1:34:47] very structure of the heart, it begins
[1:34:49] to fail. It becomes smaller. Ain't that
[1:34:51] the way it is? The love that you had one
[1:34:53] for another, it begins to fade away.
[1:34:55] Your heart ain't even got what it takes
[1:34:57] to contain it. And then all of a sudden,
[1:34:59] brother Mark, then the body temperature
[1:35:00] drops. And now the entire body is
[1:35:02] chilled because it's being starved
[1:35:06] &gt;&gt; because it failed to eat.
[1:35:08] And then it says after this that people
[1:35:11] become irritable and it becomes
[1:35:13] difficult for them to concentrate. I
[1:35:16] thought isn't that exactly right. You
[1:35:18] take a starving person and now they
[1:35:21] couldn't hear God's trying to tell them
[1:35:23] something but they but because they're
[1:35:25] in this condition said they're
[1:35:27] irritable. Anything you say it would it
[1:35:29] would irritate them. It becomes
[1:35:31] difficult to concentrate on things. And
[1:35:33] even in the late stages of starvation,
[1:35:35] they can actually start to experience
[1:35:37] hallucinations.
[1:35:39] You know what that means? That means
[1:35:40] they see things that aren't there.
[1:35:42] &gt;&gt; Hello, somebody.
[1:35:44] &gt;&gt; They things become threats that aren't
[1:35:46] real threats because they're just hungry
[1:35:49] spiritually and all of a sudden these
[1:35:50] hallucinations come by. Well, that
[1:35:52] sister don't like me anyway. I I don't I
[1:35:54] tell you what. Well, I don't much like
[1:35:56] her either.
[1:35:57] &gt;&gt; Well, I can tell she was talking about
[1:35:58] me. Do you see how she was looking over
[1:36:00] here at us? I see how Chloe looked at me
[1:36:01] just now. She don't like what I'm
[1:36:02] preaching. I can tell by the way she
[1:36:04] looked at me. It's hallucinations.
[1:36:07] It's hallucinations that But because
[1:36:09] we're starving spiritually, it caused
[1:36:11] you to see things that aren't there. I
[1:36:13] know what his motive is. I know what
[1:36:15] they're trying to do. I know what this
[1:36:17] is all about. I know I know the real
[1:36:19] reason of all it's hallucinations
[1:36:22] &gt;&gt; because our spirit is starving for
[1:36:24] spiritual food. says see eventually
[1:36:28] there's nothing left for the body to
[1:36:29] scavenge except muscle and once the
[1:36:32] protein stores started getting used then
[1:36:35] the doctor says then death is not far
[1:36:37] away. I thought my if we could see the
[1:36:40] signs of what starvation was if we could
[1:36:44] see the signs of a the death of a
[1:36:46] starving believer but the mark that
[1:36:48] death was not far away would it cause us
[1:36:51] to turn to God and say God just let me
[1:36:53] be an eater. Lord, I pray you'd
[1:36:56] strengthen me, Lord, that sometimes when
[1:36:58] I don't have the strength to eat. Maybe
[1:37:00] somebody would come by and and take the
[1:37:02] hand of God and just feed me a little at
[1:37:04] a time to give me back my strength.
[1:37:06] Friends, let me tell you, every one of
[1:37:08] us have been sick. Sometimes we get sick
[1:37:10] in our body. And sometimes we get sick
[1:37:12] in our spirit. Sometimes we lose our
[1:37:14] joy. Sometimes we lose our faith. And
[1:37:16] sometimes we just have to be fed by the
[1:37:18] hand of God. And I say, God, when I come
[1:37:21] to that place, Lord, let me come with an
[1:37:24] open mouth and let the word of God feed
[1:37:26] me. Lord, let me draw strength that I
[1:37:28] could come back to the house of God. And
[1:37:30] next Sunday, let me be a little bit more
[1:37:32] on fire. And the next Wednesday, let me
[1:37:34] be a little bit more on fire. Let me be
[1:37:36] strengthened by your word. Let a revival
[1:37:38] build in my heart. Let me have the
[1:37:41] strength of the word of God, the bread
[1:37:43] of God's word, and let me be satisfied.
[1:37:48] She realized what I've been feeding on
[1:37:50] is what's keeping us alive as a music
[1:37:53] players want to come. I thought, you
[1:37:55] know, if your physical body needs food
[1:37:57] each day, you know what the doctor said?
[1:37:59] You need 2,00 to 2500 calories a day in
[1:38:04] order to sustain your your life and your
[1:38:06] health. I thought, well, I wonder how
[1:38:08] many faith calories a person needs in a
[1:38:10] day in order to sustain your spiritual
[1:38:12] health. If your natural body has to have
[1:38:14] it, how many faith calories do we need
[1:38:16] every day, brother Mark, to sustain our
[1:38:18] spiritual health? Here's what here's
[1:38:20] what Paul said. He said, "This is the
[1:38:21] source of our life." He said, "See, our
[1:38:23] if our natural body needs food and drink
[1:38:26] to survive, our spiritual body needs
[1:38:27] food and communion with the Lord each
[1:38:29] day in order to survive." Paul said,
[1:38:31] "This is our source." He said, "I am
[1:38:33] crucified with Christ. Nevertheless, I
[1:38:35] live, not I, but Christ liveth in me.
[1:38:38] And the life which I now live in the
[1:38:40] flesh, I live by the faith of the son of
[1:38:42] God who loved me and gave himself for
[1:38:44] me. In other words, what I've been
[1:38:46] feeding on is what's keeping me alive.
[1:38:48] He said, "It ain't me that lives anyway.
[1:38:50] It's Christ that's living in me. It
[1:38:53] ain't me that's got this revival. It's
[1:38:54] Christ that's living in me." And
[1:38:56] friends, it ain't just on a weekend. It
[1:38:57] ain't on a just on a Sunday. It ain't on
[1:38:59] Wednesday. But I can tell you what
[1:39:00] Brother Ram said. He said, "Each day,
[1:39:02] we've got to study the Bible." Some
[1:39:04] people, they don't study at all. some
[1:39:06] picks it up every two or three times a
[1:39:08] year. He said, "But a real believer
[1:39:09] that's really spiritually built up, he
[1:39:12] reads his Bible every day and he talks
[1:39:14] to the Lord."
[1:39:16] &gt;&gt; We have to feed on the word of God.
[1:39:19] Won't you stand to your feet tonight?
[1:39:21] Isaiah said, "The word of God is seed to
[1:39:26] the swer and it's bread to the eater."
[1:39:30] I believe that tonight. There had to be
[1:39:32] a seed. There had to be a swer. There
[1:39:36] had to be bread and there has to be an
[1:39:38] eater. I think if we could look at this
[1:39:41] every time we come in the house of God
[1:39:43] that way. You realize what God is doing.
[1:39:46] He's given us bread for our journey.
[1:39:48] Isn't that what he done with Israel? I
[1:39:50] love how the Bible says it. It says from
[1:39:51] the time they got they got up the next
[1:39:53] morning and when the dew was on the
[1:39:55] grass, right in the morning dew, he
[1:39:58] didn't even let them go partway through
[1:39:59] the day before they got what they had
[1:40:02] need of. But right amidst the morning
[1:40:04] dew, he said, "There lay a little round
[1:40:07] thing that was a wafer." And they went
[1:40:09] out and begin to pick it up. And the
[1:40:11] prophet Moses came by. They said, "We
[1:40:13] don't know what this is." Moses is that
[1:40:15] is the bread that God has sent down from
[1:40:17] heaven. I thank God today that brother
[1:40:20] Travis, he has not neglected his church,
[1:40:22] but for the time that we from the from
[1:40:24] the time of Jesus until the time of the
[1:40:26] rapture, he said he'll make sure that
[1:40:28] they're fed. They're never going to be
[1:40:30] begging bread. And just like he did in
[1:40:32] the days of Moses, he sent a prophet in
[1:40:34] this day that you could identify what
[1:40:36] you're eating and say that is the bread
[1:40:38] of life and is good for food.
[1:40:41] &gt;&gt; Just open your mouth and feed on it and
[1:40:43] it'll give you life.
[1:40:46] I believe that. He said, "See, God has
[1:40:48] given us fresh mana." Said, "You can't
[1:40:50] say two weeks ago, I had a great
[1:40:52] experience, but what about right now?" I
[1:40:55] say, "What about right now?"
[1:40:57] &gt;&gt; Every day a fresh, a new blessing, a new
[1:40:59] something coming down from God. the
[1:41:01] hidden mana coming from God out of
[1:41:02] heaven. And we feast upon this mana
[1:41:04] which is Christ and he sustains us
[1:41:07] through the journey till we reach the
[1:41:09] land on the other side. Amen. How many
[1:41:12] believe that tonight?
[1:41:14] Amen.
[1:41:19] What are you playing, brother?
[1:41:21] [Music]
[1:41:23] And it's keeping me
[1:41:26] keeping me alive.
[1:41:29] keeping me alive. Well, it's all over me
[1:41:34] and it's keeping me alive. Well, Jesus
[1:41:38] is keeping me alive.
[1:41:41] Well, it's down in my heart and it's

[1:41:54] heart and it's keeping me alive. But

[1:42:35] and fire, keeping me alive. Well, Jesus
[1:42:40] is keeping me alive.
[1:42:43] Well, it's down in my heart and it's
[1:42:46] keeping me alive.
[1:42:49] Keeping me alive.
[1:42:52] keeping me alive. Well, it's down in my
[1:42:55] heart and it's keeping me alive. I know
[1:42:59] Jesus is keeping me alive.
[1:43:03] I said it's down in my heart and it's
[1:43:07] keeping me alive.
[1:43:10] Keeping me alive. Well, it's keeping me
[1:43:13] alive. Well, it's down in my heart and
[1:43:17] it's keeping me alive. Well, Jesus is
[1:43:21] keeping me alive.
[1:43:24] I know it's all over me and it's keeping
[1:43:28] me alive.
[1:43:30] Keeping me alive, keeping me alive. But
[1:43:35] it's on.
[1:43:38] [Music]
[1:43:44] I know the Holy Ghost will set your feet
[1:43:48] to dancing.
[1:43:50] The Holy Ghost will see you through and
[1:43:53] through.
[1:43:55] The Holy Ghost will set your feet a
[1:43:58] dancing
[1:44:00] and set your heart dancing too.
[1:44:05] Well, it's all over me and it's keeping
[1:44:09] me alive.
[1:44:11] Keeping me alive. Well, it's keeping me
[1:44:15] alive. Well, it's all over me.
[1:44:19] Keeping me alive.
[1:44:21] Jesus is keeping me alive.
[1:44:27] [Music]
[1:44:31] I'm glad we got something that can in
[1:44:33] life.
[1:44:34] &gt;&gt; Amen. Are you glad of it tonight?
[1:44:36] &gt;&gt; Amen. We have bread. How many eaters do
[1:44:39] we have in here?
[1:44:40] &gt;&gt; Amen. We're not going to starve oursel,
[1:44:42] but we're going to feed on the word
[1:44:44] &gt;&gt; every time we come in the house of God.
[1:44:46] That's going to be our purpose is to
[1:44:48] feed on the word of God and draw
[1:44:50] strength from God's word.
[1:44:52] &gt;&gt; Amen. Will you pray for the sers?
[1:44:54] &gt;&gt; Amen. I said, will you pray for the
[1:44:57] sers? The sers need prayer, too.
[1:45:00] Isn't that wonderful that God would open
[1:45:02] something such a way to our heart that
[1:45:05] we could receive everything that we have
[1:45:07] need of? That's why we don't do away
[1:45:09] with preachers. I know there's a lot of
[1:45:10] people in this world today, they don't
[1:45:12] have need of them anymore. And maybe
[1:45:14] some people's been burned and maybe
[1:45:16] they've been they they some men had
[1:45:18] mistreated them or something like that.
[1:45:20] But you know, we don't do away with the
[1:45:22] preachers. We don't do away with
[1:45:24] believers because there's hypocrites.
[1:45:27] We don't do away with preachers because
[1:45:29] there's false teachers, but we believe
[1:45:31] the word of God.
[1:45:33] &gt;&gt; Amen. You love the Lord tonight. Can
[1:45:36] &gt;&gt; you get the key of G?
[1:45:39] [Music]
[1:45:41] Oh, why don't you just give up and let
[1:45:46] Jesus
[1:45:47] take over?
[1:45:51] Oh, give up and let Jesus take over.
[1:46:01] Why don't you give up
[1:46:04] and let Jesus
[1:46:07] take over?
[1:46:12] I know that he'll
[1:46:15] he'll make a way
[1:46:18] for you.
[1:46:21] I said, "Why don't you give up
[1:46:25] &gt;&gt; and let Jesus
[1:46:27] &gt;&gt; let Jesus
[1:46:28] &gt;&gt; take over?
[1:46:32] Why don't you give up? give up
[1:46:36] &gt;&gt; and let Jesus
[1:46:37] &gt;&gt; let Jesus

[1:46:46] &gt;&gt; And let Jesus Jesus
[1:46:49] &gt;&gt; take over.
[1:46:53] I know that he'll
[1:46:57] he'll make a way
[1:47:00] somehow. Can I say it like this? If you
[1:47:03] got some mountains, well now if you
[1:47:07] got mountains
[1:47:09] &gt;&gt; got mountains
[1:47:10] &gt;&gt; that you
[1:47:13] can climb.
[1:47:15] You got any rivers?
[1:47:18] If you got any rivers
[1:47:21] that you
[1:47:23] can't cross,
[1:47:25] well now if you got
[1:47:29] any valleys
[1:47:32] that you
[1:47:34] can't spend,
[1:47:36] oh just let Jesus
[1:47:39] take a hold
[1:47:42] of your hand.
[1:47:45] Oh, now why don't you give up
[1:47:50] and let Jesus
[1:47:51] &gt;&gt; let Jesus
[1:47:53] &gt;&gt; take over?
[1:47:57] Why don't you give up
[1:48:00] and let Jesus
[1:48:02] &gt;&gt; Let Jesus
[1:48:03] &gt;&gt; take over?
[1:48:07] Why don't you give up
[1:48:10] and let Jesus Jesus
[1:48:13] &gt;&gt; take over?
[1:48:18] I know that he'll
[1:48:21] make a way
[1:48:24] somehow.
[1:48:27] Well, now if you got burdens
[1:48:33] that are too hard
[1:48:36] to bear,
[1:48:38] and I say if your low
[1:48:44] &gt;&gt; is more
[1:48:46] than your share,
[1:48:49] then just kneel down.
[1:48:50] &gt;&gt; Kneel down
[1:48:51] &gt;&gt; and talk to Jesus. Cuz I know he's a God
[1:48:57] who cares.
[1:48:59] Oh, I know that he'll Yes, he'll make a
[1:49:02] way
[1:49:05] somehow.
[1:49:09] So why don't you give up
[1:49:12] &gt;&gt; and let Jesus
[1:49:15] &gt;&gt; take over?
[1:49:20] Why don't you give up
[1:49:23] and let Jesus
[1:49:26] &gt;&gt; take over?
[1:49:28] [Music]
[1:49:30] Why don't you give up?
[1:49:33] &gt;&gt; Let Jesus
[1:49:36] take over.
[1:49:40] I know that he'll
[1:49:44] make a way
[1:49:46] somehow.
[1:49:50] Oh, just give up. Give up. Let Jesus

[1:50:17] &gt;&gt; stay
[1:50:22] and he
[1:50:25] make way.
[1:50:27] Oh, somehow.
[1:50:30] &gt;&gt; Oh, give the Lord a hand clap of praise
[1:50:32] tonight.
[1:50:35] Aren't you thankful you could just give
[1:50:37] up and just give it to God? Lift your
[1:50:39] hands and surrender and he'll take
[1:50:41] control from there. Let's sing this song
[1:50:43] as we go. He set me free. He set me
[1:50:45] free. I'm not sure what can you figure
[1:50:47] it out. He said we're free people
[1:50:49] tonight. So why don't we just act like
[1:50:50] that?
[1:50:51] &gt;&gt; Well, once like a bird in prison, I
[1:50:55] dwell. Oh, no. Freom from my sorrow I
[1:51:00] felt. Oh, but then Jesus came and he
[1:51:04] listened to me. And glory to God, he set
[1:51:10] me free. Oh yes, he set me free. Yes, he
[1:51:14] set me free. Oh, he broke the bond of
[1:51:19] ris for me and I'm glory bound by Jesus
[1:51:25] to see. Oh, glory to God. He set me
[1:51:30] free. Oh, now I am I
[1:51:35] shame. Oh, darkness of night has drifted
[1:51:40] away. Oh, my feet are planted on higher
[1:51:45] ground. And glory to God, I'm home were
[1:51:50] bound. Oh, he set me free. Yes, he set
[1:51:54] me free. Oh, he broke the bond of risen
[1:51:59] for me. And I'm going bound my Jesus to
[1:52:05] see. Oh, glory to God. He set me free.
[1:52:11] Oh, goodbye to sin and things that
[1:52:14] confound. Oh, not of this world shall
[1:52:18] turn me around. Oh, daily I'm working
[1:52:23] and I'm praying to and glory to God. I'm
[1:52:28] going through. Oh, he set me free. Yes,
[1:52:33] he set me free. Oh, he broke the bond of
[1:52:38] risen for me. And I'm glory bound by
[1:52:43] Jesus to see. Oh, glory to God.
[1:52:48] Let's sing that last verse once more.
[1:52:50] Goodbye to sin and things that come. Oh,
[1:52:55] not of this world shall turn me around.
[1:53:00] Oh, daily I'm eating and I'm praying,
[1:53:04] too.
[1:53:05] Oh, glory to God. I'm going through. Oh
[1:53:10] yes, he set me free. Yes, he set me
[1:53:14] free. Oh, he broke the bomb of risen for
[1:53:19] me. And I'm glory bound by Jesus to see.
[1:53:25] Oh, glory to God. Oh, God bless you
[1:53:28] tonight. We'll see you Sunday. Oh, he
[1:53:30] said be free. Yes, he set me free. For
[1:53:35] he broke the bond of risen for me. Well,
[1:53:40] I'm going bound my Jesus to see. Oh,
[1:53:45] glory to God. He set me free. Oh, now I
[1:53:51] am climbing higher shame. For darkness
[1:53:56] of night has drifted away. Oh my feet
[1:54:01] all planted on higher ground. And glory
[1:54:05] to God, my home word bound for he set me
[1:54:11] free. Yes, he set me free. Oh, he broke
[1:54:15] the bond of prison for me. I'm glory
[1:54:21] bound by Jesus.
[1:54:24] Glory to God. He set me free. Yes, he
[1:54:30] set me free. Yes, he set me free.
