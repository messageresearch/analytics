[32:15] the 10th verse just give you a moment to
[32:18] to get there and and just be praying
[32:21] about the the youth meetings uh was
[32:24] messaging with brother Nathan he kind of
[32:26] puts that uh or heads up the meeting at
[32:28] brother Wayne's Church there in Ohio and
[32:32] uh we're expecting a real move of the
[32:33] Holy Ghost amen so y'all I I I know
[32:37] that's needed and especially in in every
[32:39] in every hour it's needed but especially
[32:41] today I don't know of a greater need uh
[32:44] then a moving of the spirit of God
[32:45] amongst the young people amen so just
[32:48] want to keep that near to our heart
[32:50] tonight as as we go so I just want to
[32:52] speak out of Revelations the first
[32:54] chapter and we'll start in the 10th
[32:55] verse the Bible said and I I was in the
[32:58] spirit on the Lord's day and I heard
[33:00] behind me a great voice as of a trumpet
[33:02] saying I am Alpha and Omega the first
[33:04] and the last what thou seest write in
[33:06] the book and send it to the seven
[33:08] churches which are in Asia unto Ephesus
[33:10] samna pergamus thyra Sardis Philadelphia
[33:13] and un Le oosa and I turned to see the
[33:16] voice that spake with me and being
[33:18] turned I saw seven golden candlesticks
[33:21] and in the midst of the seven
[33:22] candlesticks one like unto the son of
[33:24] man he was clothed with a garment down
[33:26] to the foot and gir about the paps with
[33:28] a golden girdle and his head and his
[33:31] hairs were white like wool and as white
[33:33] as snow and his eyes were as a flame of
[33:35] fire and his feet like undefined brass
[33:38] and they burned in a furnace and his
[33:40] voice as the sound of many Waters and he
[33:42] had in his right hand Seven Stars and
[33:45] out of his mouth went a sharp two-edged
[33:47] sword and his countenance was as the sun
[33:50] shineth in his strength and we'll just
[33:52] ask the Lord to add his blessing upon
[33:54] the reading of the word tonight now I
[33:56] won't be able to preach all this tonight
[33:58] but as you take your seats uh I I would
[34:01] like to speak if uh just just for the
[34:03] sake of the brother and the uh the the
[34:06] the video if they could maybe have a
[34:08] title in the midst of them but I'd like
[34:10] to take a portion of this as we've been
[34:12] speaking um over over the Revelation and
[34:16] and and the purpose of Revelation in the
[34:18] church and we took several Services uh
[34:21] going in this direction and uh and the
[34:23] Lord willing we'll we'll try to take uh
[34:25] this portion of scripture and maybe take
[34:27] some different things things out of it
[34:28] each uh Wednesday that we that we're
[34:30] able to speak and and and kind of go in
[34:32] that direction and U but but we realize
[34:36] that uh as we've been speaking on this
[34:38] on Revelation and the church is growing
[34:40] and and uh going into the place where
[34:42] God wants us to be I I I really believe
[34:45] this tonight I believe that the church
[34:46] can only go as high as its Revelation I
[34:49] believe that's our uh that that that is
[34:51] our limitation is the Revelation that we
[34:53] have and and I also believe that the
[34:55] Revelation comes by the spirit of God
[34:57] and so if God is going to take us to new
[34:59] heights and he's going to continue to
[35:01] take the church into this uh uh place
[35:03] that God wants to take us into then
[35:05] it'll take the spirit of God I believe
[35:06] that's why brother brandham preached so
[35:08] many messages concerning the spirit of
[35:10] God many times he would preach a message
[35:12] called being led by the spirit or or the
[35:14] leading of the spirit he preached on
[35:16] spiritual food in due season he preached
[35:18] on on the manifestation of the spirit he
[35:20] preached on getting into the spirit so
[35:23] many times this was a uh this was a real
[35:25] theme in his ministry was the spirit of
[35:27] God God moving amongst the Church of God
[35:29] and and even whenever John would write
[35:32] this when he wrote in the Book of
[35:33] Revelation first John would say I was in
[35:35] the spirit on the Lord's day and I heard
[35:38] behind me a great voice so here before
[35:40] you even see the revelation of what John
[35:42] was writing we realize that first if it
[35:45] took John getting in the spirit in order
[35:47] to ride it then what's it going to take
[35:48] in order for you to see it see so if he
[35:51] had to get in the spirit to ride it then
[35:52] it'll take you getting into the spirit
[35:54] in order to receive the revelation of it
[35:56] so brother R would say this he said see
[35:57] the kingdom of God is established in the
[36:00] heart and the soul of a man by the
[36:01] revelation of Jesus Christ how many
[36:03] believe that the kingdom of God is
[36:05] established in the heart of man by the
[36:08] revelation of Jesus Christ for he said
[36:10] Upon This Rock I'll build my church and
[36:12] the Gates of Hell shall not Prevail
[36:14] against it so in other words it was upon
[36:16] this Revelation he says see so it's
[36:18] going to take a revelation for you to
[36:19] get there and to have a revelation then
[36:21] you have to become a Believer and if
[36:23] you're going to be a believer then
[36:24] there'll be signs that follow what you
[36:26] believe say well how's it be because the
[36:28] same things that Jesus done the church
[36:30] would do because she is what he was see
[36:33] whenever you read about Christ and see
[36:35] what what was Christ in the scripture
[36:37] brother Jared you'll find that Christ he
[36:39] was the Messiah he said he the he but
[36:42] what is the Messiah the Messiah is the
[36:44] kingdom of God it was the anointed ones
[36:47] it was brother said the Messiah today is
[36:49] the kingdom of God anointed ones them
[36:51] Anointed with the same spirit that God
[36:54] or that Jesus was anointed with so if he
[36:56] was called the Messiah which he was
[36:58] because he was anointed with the Holy
[37:00] Spirit then any church that's Anointed
[37:02] with the same Holy Spirit today is a
[37:05] messiah they're a little or a smaller
[37:07] God and someday when this body is
[37:09] resurrected he said I hope beforehand I
[37:11] hope before we get to this place that
[37:13] God can get a hold of a bunch of people
[37:15] that'll manifest his power in every
[37:18] Dimension that it's supposed to be in I
[37:20] thank God that God would send somebody
[37:22] to remind the church that he's calling
[37:24] the church to something else it's
[37:25] something greater than the things that
[37:27] that's going on around us and these
[37:28] little the little things and the little
[37:30] trials and the little tribulation and
[37:32] the little pressures and the and the
[37:34] little Temptations and the things that
[37:35] all the world gets so wrapped up in and
[37:37] they cause these these great marches and
[37:39] great uh uh these great movements and
[37:41] things just some little thing that would
[37:42] happen but here a prophet of God would
[37:44] take the church and say but when the
[37:46] spirit of God comes to the church and a
[37:48] church has the same spirit that Christ
[37:50] had that church would be the very
[37:52] Messiah it would be the kingdom of God
[37:54] that came into the heart of Believers to
[37:56] see so the spirit of God is what allows
[37:59] you to overcome says so it'll take the
[38:01] spirit of God it'll allow you to
[38:02] overcome the church how many believe
[38:04] this today that we are a spiritual
[38:06] church how many say that with me we're a
[38:07] spiritual church we're a spiritual
[38:09] people I realize when you look around
[38:11] this world today you find out that
[38:13] people are bound by carnality people are
[38:15] bound by the Flesh and you know they're
[38:17] they're Bound by uh by the things that
[38:19] goes on in this flesh but we realize
[38:21] that that that in this carnality that we
[38:23] as a people in our flesh have been
[38:25] living under this law called The Law of
[38:28] sin and death how many's familiar with
[38:29] it we've been living under this law
[38:31] we've been we we've been bound under
[38:33] this law and you realize that the law of
[38:34] sin and death that it was actually the
[38:37] law over flesh in other words it was the
[38:39] law of sin and death it binds you to
[38:41] flesh in fact the there was a flesh act
[38:44] that caused the curse of the law to come
[38:46] upon the people of God so so you see
[38:48] this is this is the law that we've been
[38:50] bound under there there's so much
[38:52] pressure and all the things that come
[38:53] upon your flesh it's because of this law
[38:55] the things that we battle in our carnal
[38:57] mind it's because of this law and in and
[39:00] in this flesh life that we live in but
[39:02] you realize what the Bible says is that
[39:04] the church isn't to follow after the
[39:06] flesh but the Bible gave us an escape
[39:08] from the flesh so I I thank God that
[39:10] here that we we realize that because of
[39:12] our flesh birth and because of our
[39:13] nature that we're with that we're in all
[39:15] of this and we're in this great battle
[39:17] and there's this great carnality and
[39:18] this war that's going on but then when
[39:20] you'd open up your Bible it would show
[39:22] an escape path it says see Paul said see
[39:24] the church he said there's no
[39:25] condemnation to them that are in Christ
[39:28] Jesus who walk not after the flesh but
[39:30] walk after the spirit so here here Paul
[39:33] says we have a release from condemnation
[39:35] and that release is is to don't follow
[39:37] after the flesh but follow after the
[39:39] spirit of God don't mind the things of
[39:41] the flesh but mind the things of the
[39:43] spirit keep your heart not set on the
[39:44] things of the flesh but keep your heart
[39:46] set upon the spirit of God he said it'll
[39:48] release you from condemnation it it
[39:50] releases you from bondage it releases
[39:52] you from the the pressures and things
[39:54] that keep you so wrapped up that you
[39:56] can't even worship God and you you can't
[39:58] really be a believer and you can't
[40:00] really manifest what what you want to
[40:02] manifest and you you don't you don't
[40:03] have the joy in your salvation and you
[40:05] know there's something that just kind of
[40:07] keeps you down and and you know you're a
[40:08] Christian and you know you're a Believer
[40:10] but but there's something that just
[40:11] won't let you break through and really
[40:13] show the joy that you feel on the inside
[40:15] of you but Paul said but here's a
[40:17] release from all of that to not walk
[40:19] after the flesh but walk after spirit I
[40:22] think it ought to be the call of the
[40:23] church today is to mind spiritual things
[40:26] it's a call to the church to follow
[40:28] after the spirit of God for Paul he said
[40:30] see the law of the spirit of life in
[40:31] Christ Jesus has made me free somebody
[40:34] say free from the law of sin and death
[40:37] for what the law could not do because it
[40:39] was weak through the flesh but God
[40:41] sending his own son in the likeness of
[40:43] Flesh condemn sin in the flesh that the
[40:46] righteousness of the law might be
[40:48] fulfilled in us I think this is a
[40:50] powerful scripture he said the
[40:52] righteousness of the law might be
[40:53] fulfilled in us see many many times when
[40:56] you read this scripture you in Romans
[40:58] 8:4 but when you read this it looks like
[41:00] that that that when Paul says the
[41:02] righteousness of the law it looks like
[41:04] that in this law there is righteousness
[41:06] laying there it looks like that there in
[41:08] other words that the law possesses
[41:10] righteousness because he says the
[41:11] righteousness of the law might be
[41:13] fulfilled but that's see that's what
[41:15] they taught that's what Judaism taught
[41:17] and in the in the time of Paul it was
[41:19] taught that this righteousness came from
[41:21] the sacrifice that you made in other
[41:23] words there was uh that in the sacrifice
[41:25] lay righteousness and it's what that
[41:27] that's why that men could go out and
[41:29] they could make a sacrifice and they in
[41:31] in any other way they could live it
[41:32] didn't matter as long as they made their
[41:34] sacrifice and every every month they
[41:36] came before the priest and they they
[41:38] they done the duty as they should do but
[41:39] because their righteousness laid in the
[41:41] sacrifice but whenever Christ came he
[41:43] pointed to him that this is a this is a
[41:45] dead religion this is a th this isn't
[41:48] this isn't the children of God this
[41:49] isn't what God's calling us to he's
[41:51] calling you to a new nature he's calling
[41:53] you to a New Life it ain't going through
[41:55] some ritual the the righteousness don't
[41:57] love in the law that you're trying to
[41:58] live he said that that ain't where it is
[42:00] and in fact when you read this scripture
[42:02] when you read it correctly you'll find
[42:04] this word righteousness it comes from a
[42:06] Greek word called uh di Yoma which
[42:09] actually means a righteous deed or a
[42:12] righteous act so when you read this it's
[42:14] showing us that it wasn't that that it
[42:16] wasn't that the righteousness was in the
[42:17] law but it was actually speaking of the
[42:20] act of righteousness or a deed of
[42:22] righteousness so so when you read this
[42:24] uh scripture you realize that never that
[42:26] never did a sacrifice ever make a
[42:29] righteous act so think about Paul's
[42:30] talking about a righteous Act of the law
[42:33] might be fulfilled in you but never
[42:35] answer when when did a sacrifice ever
[42:37] make a righteous act when did a when did
[42:39] a lamb ever go and and be sacrificed on
[42:41] his own free will when did a goat ever
[42:43] go and say it was on my own will this
[42:45] was the desire of my heart was was to to
[42:48] to to to make this sacrifice but never
[42:50] was there a willing sacrifice but when
[42:52] it came to Jesus everything changed cuz
[42:55] remember when Jesus when he went and he
[42:56] talked to the father he said Lord if
[42:58] that be possible let this cup pass from
[43:00] me but then he went on and said but
[43:02] nevertheless not my will but thy will be
[43:05] done here he was willing in his flesh to
[43:07] allow the will of God to take over his
[43:09] life do you realize what happened here
[43:11] here when he said this Brother Kyle all
[43:13] of a sudden now we have a righteous act
[43:15] we have we have a man that would
[43:17] surrender his own life willingly it it
[43:19] was an act of righteousness it was
[43:22] something that he knew brother bam said
[43:24] it was on his mind he knew what was
[43:25] going to happen to him he he knew that
[43:27] he was going to Calvary he knew that he
[43:29] was going to Gethsemane he knew that he
[43:31] would go to Pilot's judgment Hall he he
[43:33] knew that he would be beaten and mocked
[43:35] he knew that his great gifts would be
[43:37] put on trial he knew those things but he
[43:40] continued to walk he continued to walk
[43:42] in the in in in the vision that the
[43:44] father had showed unto him because
[43:46] brother brother Morgan it was it wasn't
[43:48] the men that was driving him you realize
[43:50] it was a righteous act that was walked
[43:52] up calvary's hill it wasn't the beating
[43:54] that made him take another step it
[43:56] wasn't the whips that they had behind
[43:57] him that forced him to take another step
[43:59] it it wasn't nobody pushing him that
[44:01] caused him to continue to walk it it
[44:03] wasn't because he was was afraid that
[44:05] caused him to go in that way but you
[44:07] realize that he went to make a sacrifice
[44:10] so that the spirit of Life Could dwell
[44:12] in humanity again listen what Christ was
[44:15] doing you you remember brother I'm
[44:16] telling the story even though a
[44:18] sacrifice was accepted accepted by God
[44:21] don't don't mean that it was a righteous
[44:22] act you you realize that when Adam or
[44:25] that it was a willing act but when Adam
[44:26] took when he when he went took that
[44:28] sacrifice he said he took an old grape
[44:30] vine around his neck and that by that
[44:31] grap Vine he dragged it down to an altar
[44:33] and he bound it and and and he took his
[44:35] life but that ain't the way Christ went
[44:37] to Calvary he went willingly he took a
[44:39] it was a righteous act and brother
[44:41] brother Kyle it wasn't just that the
[44:43] spirit of God would be alive it was so
[44:45] that it would dwell in humanity it was a
[44:47] place to bring the spirit of God upon
[44:49] the people of God that he could dwell in
[44:51] their midst and it wasn't just see many
[44:54] has taken this well well he came to the
[44:56] Jews he was was born of the Jews but
[44:57] notice it wasn't just to the Jews but he
[45:00] came to open a door to the Gentiles that
[45:02] by this righteous act that this gentile
[45:05] people could possess the spirit of God
[45:08] now that makes me want to shout that he
[45:10] came to the Gentiles that this righteous
[45:12] act could possess by this righteous act
[45:15] that we could possess the spirit of God
[45:17] I think it's something to think about of
[45:19] how that we realize that this act of
[45:21] sacrificing that that that this was
[45:24] something that the Jewish people were
[45:25] accustomed to do you realize that sacri
[45:26] sacrifices they weren't made by everyone
[45:29] in the world it wasn't this was this is
[45:31] what God had raised his people to this
[45:33] is the law that he had given to the Jews
[45:35] and and they went out and they made
[45:37] sacrifices according to the law of Moses
[45:39] but but the gentile people they were
[45:41] outside the temple they weren't they
[45:42] weren't in making sacrifices but when
[45:44] Christ came he came from the Jews to the
[45:47] gentile people you can you can find this
[45:49] in the Bible it's a it's a perfect type
[45:51] in the story of Jonah you notice when
[45:53] God called Jonah he said go into Nineveh
[45:56] he said the Lord came to him go to
[45:58] Nineveh this great City and cry out
[46:00] against it for their wickedness has come
[46:01] up before me butam said notice what this
[46:04] was he said I think the principal reason
[46:06] that I believe God did this great thing
[46:09] is because Jonah was a Jew he said the
[46:11] reason he said so he asked him to go to
[46:13] a gentile City and to cry out against it
[46:16] thinking that he would he would not be
[46:18] received because the Gentiles would say
[46:20] what's this Jew got to do with us but
[46:22] you see another thing it gives us a
[46:23] great thing here to see that God not
[46:25] only is he the god god of the Jew but
[46:28] he's also the god of the Gentile he's a
[46:30] God of all people so God just chose the
[46:33] Jews he says see the Jews they were
[46:35] called they were God's chosen people but
[46:38] they were chosen for a specific cause
[46:40] and that cause was to give them the law
[46:43] and they could not keep it he said that
[46:45] was the purpose of God calling them God
[46:47] chose them to give them the law and they
[46:49] couldn't keep the law that God gave them
[46:51] and he used them and he showed by that
[46:54] people that the law could not be kept
[46:57] and that he was the god of righteousness
[47:00] so here God would use these people that
[47:02] that they would go through this time
[47:03] Brother Kyle and they would live this
[47:05] life they couldn't keep the law he said
[47:07] but he would this law it would demand
[47:09] righteousness but they weren't able to
[47:10] keep it it would demand it of them but
[47:12] there was no Grace in it to bring a man
[47:14] out of it he said the penalty was paid
[47:17] there was no penalty paid by the law but
[47:19] it would take Grace to pay the penalty
[47:21] that the law had put us under that's why
[47:23] Paul would take this and he would say
[47:25] speaking of Christ he would say that the
[47:28] righteousness of the law might be
[47:30] fulfilled in us who who who would the
[47:34] righteousness of the law be fulfilled in
[47:36] he said those who walk not after the
[47:39] flesh but walk after the spirit so here
[47:42] Paul lays this for the Believers that we
[47:44] are a spiritual people and if we those
[47:46] that walk after the spirit he said
[47:48] because we are after The Flesh those
[47:50] that are after The Flesh they mind the
[47:51] things of the flesh but the spirit mind
[47:53] the things of the spirit but to be
[47:55] carnally minded is death but spiritually
[47:56] minded his life because the carnal mind
[47:59] is an enemy against God and it is no not
[48:01] subject to the law of God and it can't
[48:03] be so then they that are in the flesh
[48:05] cannot please God but you are not in the
[48:08] flesh but you're in the spirit how many
[48:10] say
[48:11] Amen if so the spirit of God dwelleth in
[48:14] you and if any man have not the spirit
[48:16] of Christ he is none of his isn't that
[48:18] wonderful if the spirit of God dwelleth
[48:20] in you cuz that's the that's the battle
[48:22] that we get into as Believers am I in
[48:24] the flesh or am in the spirit am I am I
[48:26] minding the things of the flesh am I
[48:28] minding the things of the spirit I I
[48:29] have a job and I try to focus on taking
[48:31] care of my family so does that mean I'm
[48:33] minding the things of the Flesh and no
[48:35] no it ain't got nothing to do with it
[48:36] here he said if the spirit of Christ
[48:38] dwelleth in you then you are not in the
[48:42] flesh but in the spirit that's what it
[48:45] takes is the spirit of God to dwell in
[48:48] you see many many call theirselves
[48:51] Christians they call Believers around
[48:53] the world but I believe this today I
[48:54] believe we have a Bible standard of what
[48:56] a believer is I believe in the spirit of
[48:58] God how many say amen I believe that
[49:00] spirit that that real believers they
[49:02] follow after the spirit of God I believe
[49:03] in the Holy Ghost I believe in the
[49:05] baptism of the Holy Spirit I I don't
[49:07] believe in anointing of the Holy Ghost I
[49:09] believe in the indwelling of the Holy
[49:10] Ghost I believe that God can come down
[49:12] and dwell in the heart of a man in the
[49:14] soul of a man and he can change that
[49:16] man's nature and he can change his life
[49:18] and he can take the desires of the flesh
[49:20] out of his life and that man can have
[49:22] victory over the flesh by the power of
[49:24] the spirit of God I'm here to today I
[49:27] can tell you as a testimony that God can
[49:29] change your desire I can tell you as a
[49:31] testimony that God can change your flesh
[49:33] I can tell you as a testimony that God
[49:35] can change the way you see things and
[49:37] the way that you see people and the way
[49:39] that you view one another God can change
[49:41] it by the spirit of God not by the flesh
[49:43] will we ever get to where we need to be
[49:45] but by the spirit we'll get just to
[49:47] where God wants us to be I believe that
[49:49] today I believe we ought to take a stand
[49:51] to be able to serve God I believe that's
[49:53] what God's called us to we got a right
[49:55] to serve him we've got a we got a right
[49:57] to stand upon the things you don't mind
[49:59] if I take my coat off do you we got a
[50:01] right to stand upon the things of God
[50:03] but you know what happens is whenever
[50:04] you take a stand to serve God don't
[50:06] don't think for a minute that you say
[50:08] well brother Matt I want to do this I I
[50:10] I want to live this life I want the
[50:11] spirit of God to dwell in me I I want to
[50:13] live a life after the spirit I want to I
[50:15] want to be pleasing unto God but
[50:17] whenever you make this stand it it's
[50:19] always met with adversity I can't find a
[50:21] person in the scripture that ever
[50:23] followed the Lord that didn't have some
[50:24] adversity or didn't have have some trial
[50:26] or some sickness or some loved one or
[50:28] some problem things that were always uh
[50:31] that there's always something an
[50:32] adversity to doing something for the
[50:34] Lord how many believes that how many
[50:37] testify that it's there's always an
[50:39] adversity to meet even in the world you
[50:41] you you go stand up and say I'm going to
[50:42] serve God and the world will meet you
[50:44] with all kinds of things they'll meet
[50:46] you with every unbeliever that there is
[50:48] will will come by and tell you
[50:49] everything that's wrong in the church
[50:51] you get a you get a little I'm going to
[50:52] preach to you a minute but you get a
[50:53] little bit of a spirit on you and get a
[50:55] a little bit of stayhome spirit on you
[50:57] well you know I just don't feel like
[50:58] going to church right now you know got a
[50:59] lot of things going on and you know and
[51:01] I I don't know if I really want to
[51:02] follow through with this and you you
[51:04] just better believe it when you go to
[51:06] the the Dollar General that somebody's
[51:08] going to meet you and say you know what
[51:09] I can't believe that anybody goes down
[51:11] there that that place anyway you know
[51:12] there ain't nothing but but trouble down
[51:14] there you know them people ain't nothing
[51:15] but a bunch of Hypocrites you better
[51:17] believe that the devil's going to find
[51:18] you when you go down the road to to so
[51:21] to water the seed that he planted did
[51:23] you hear me to water the seed that Satan
[51:25] planted in your in your mind see they're
[51:28] going to laugh at you they'll scoff you
[51:29] they'll ridicule you they'll poke at you
[51:31] they'll they'll make fun of you you you
[51:33] I I promise you you go to telling people
[51:35] that you believe in the power of the
[51:36] Holy Ghost you're going to meet an
[51:38] unbeliever you're going to meet a
[51:39] scoffer you're going to you're going to
[51:40] meet a loved one you're going to have a
[51:42] sister that'll they that'll tell you
[51:43] you're crazy you go tell somebody you
[51:45] believe in Divine Healing somebody's
[51:47] going to tell you that you've lost your
[51:48] mind there's always somebody that's an
[51:50] adversary to what you believe we have an
[51:53] adversary and he he anoints people and
[51:56] he and he he leads them to to to follow
[51:58] after the things that are ungodly you
[52:00] you tell them you believe in Holiness
[52:01] you're going to meet scoffers you tell
[52:03] them you're waiting on a Rapture you're
[52:04] going to meet unbelievers they're going
[52:06] to laugh and make fun out you but let me
[52:07] tell you what it'll never affect the
[52:09] believer hello somebody it'll never
[52:12] affect the believer you know why because
[52:14] I know that unbelievers just as much as
[52:16] I fulfill the scripture as a believer
[52:19] that the unbeliever is fulfilling the
[52:21] same Bible that I'm fulfilling do you
[52:23] realize that every scoffer is talked
[52:25] about in the Bible every m Believers
[52:27] talked about in the Bible every every
[52:29] every every unbeliever every critic
[52:31] they're talked about in the Bible all of
[52:32] those that would come against you
[52:34] they're talked about in the Bible so
[52:36] just like you are the scoffers are
[52:38] fulfilling scripture too that's what the
[52:40] Bible said Peter said know this first he
[52:42] said there shall come in the last day
[52:44] scoffers walking after their own lust
[52:46] and you know what they'll do brother
[52:47] Travis they got their own message too
[52:49] they'll come out and they preach their
[52:51] own message you say they got a message
[52:52] that's what Peter said he said and
[52:54] they'll be saying where is the prom
[52:56] promise of his coming man isn't that
[52:58] something to think there's scoffers in
[52:59] this world and they're walking around
[53:01] just like you and I and saying I don't
[53:02] believe that nonsense but we've been
[53:04] hearing about this Rapture for for 50
[53:06] years and ain't never seen no sign of it
[53:08] we've been hearing about the Lord coming
[53:10] back our whole life and we've never seen
[53:11] no sign of it but Peter said know this
[53:14] first scoffers will walk among you and
[53:16] they'll be saying this that where is the
[53:18] sign of his coming where's the promise
[53:20] of his coming since our fathers have
[53:22] fell asleep everything continues as it
[53:24] was but Peter said but know this thing
[53:26] he said they are willingly ignorant you
[53:29] know what that means it means that they
[53:31] lack knowledge or awareness he said they
[53:34] willingly are ignorant that by the word
[53:36] of God that the heavens and the Earth
[53:38] were formed willingly they are ignorant
[53:41] that it was God that came in the days of
[53:43] Noah and he destroyed the Earth by water
[53:45] and willingly they are ignorant that
[53:47] it's the same God by his same word that
[53:50] with that that upholds this world today
[53:52] and that's the only reason that the
[53:53] world is standing and willingly they are
[53:56] ignorant ignorant that it is reserved
[53:57] for fire of judgment against those that
[54:00] are enemies to God or
[54:02] unbelievers Peter said there willingly
[54:04] ignorant of this thing he said but but
[54:07] but my beloved but don't be ignorant of
[54:09] this one thing that a day with the Lord
[54:11] is a thousand years and a thousand years
[54:14] is a day the Lord is not slack
[54:17] concerning his promise to us he said but
[54:19] he's longsuffering that not willing that
[54:21] any should perish but that all should
[54:23] come to repentance a't that something
[54:26] they're looking at it one way but Peter
[54:27] said but here's the reality of it God is
[54:29] a merciful god and every day that he
[54:31] gives us is a sign of his Mercy every
[54:34] year that goes by if we go on into 20 25
[54:36] or 26 or 27 down the road into every
[54:40] year that God gives up upon this Earth
[54:42] is just another sign of the mercy of God
[54:45] of the the longsuffering mercy of
[54:47] almighty God that mean that's why
[54:49] scoffers they don't discourage Believers
[54:51] because they're fulfilling scripture see
[54:53] it's predicted that's the that's the
[54:55] reason people are acting the way they're
[54:56] acting in the world today is because the
[54:58] Bible says they would do it why is the
[55:00] country in the shape it's in well the
[55:01] Bible says it would be that way why is
[55:03] the world in the shape it's in the Bible
[55:05] said it would be that way see as
[55:07] Believers we expect it because the Bible
[55:09] says it can I read it he Paul said in
[55:11] the last days they'd be heady and high-m
[55:13] minded lovers of pleasure more than
[55:15] lovers of God they'd be truth Breakers
[55:17] false accusers incontinent despisers of
[55:20] those that are good having a form of
[55:22] godliness and denying the power thereof
[55:25] and from such turn away see so if the
[55:28] Bible says it some 2,000 years ago Paul
[55:30] wrote this in the scripture so that when
[55:32] I see these things going on I don't have
[55:34] to stand here discouraged but brother
[55:36] Joe in fact when I see the world falling
[55:39] apart it encourages me to know that what
[55:41] God Said is true when I see people in
[55:44] the condition that they're in it
[55:46] encourages me that the word of God is
[55:48] true when you see those that are truce
[55:50] Breakers and heady and high-m minded and
[55:52] the lovers of pleasure that it
[55:54] encourages you in in your faith in the
[55:57] word of God that the word of God is true
[55:59] their fulfillment of the scripture see
[56:02] everybody has a place in scripture every
[56:04] believer they're in the Bible how many
[56:05] say Amen every unbeliever they're
[56:07] written about in the Bible you can't get
[56:09] away from it every scoffer they're in
[56:10] the Bible every critic they're in the
[56:12] Bible every every fighter every guilty
[56:14] one they're in the Bible every innocent
[56:16] they're in the Bible the the false the
[56:18] true the failure the Overcomer everyone
[56:20] has their place in the Bible it's all
[56:22] written about before you and I was ever
[56:24] born it was all seen before the
[56:25] foundation of the world and it don't
[56:27] matter what you are it was written about
[56:29] in this Bible you can turn from the ways
[56:31] of God but you was wrote about in the
[56:32] Bible you can serve other gods but you
[56:34] was wrote about in the Bible you can be
[56:36] an unbeliever but you was wrote about in
[56:38] the Bible oh friends let me tell you if
[56:39] you're going to fulfill it if you're
[56:41] going to fulfill second Timothy 3 and 2
[56:43] you was wrote about in the Bible if
[56:44] you're he and high minder and a lover of
[56:46] the flesh you was wrote about in the
[56:47] Bible you'll never be able to escape it
[56:50] for the Bible says all of these things
[56:52] would take place and the Bible speaks of
[56:54] you no matter what you do or for who you
[56:56] are the Bible speaks of you it it speaks
[56:59] concerning you no matter what kind of
[57:01] person you are it speaks concerning you
[57:04] you're fulfilling scripture ain't that
[57:06] something that no matter what you do
[57:07] you're fulfilling scripture no matter
[57:10] who you are you can't get away from it
[57:11] well I don't believe the Bible I don't
[57:12] believe that n well you're fulfilling
[57:14] your scripture see but I think if we're
[57:16] going to fulfill scripture we ought to
[57:17] fulfill some different scriptures I know
[57:20] I've said this before but if you're
[57:21] going to fulfill a scripture why not
[57:22] fulfill acts 237 the Bible says when
[57:25] they heard the word they were pricked in
[57:27] their heart and they said what should we
[57:29] do to be saved see if you're going to
[57:31] fulfill a scripture won't you fulfill
[57:32] John 1:12 he said but as many as
[57:35] received Christ to them gave he power to
[57:37] become the sons of God even to them that
[57:39] believe on his name if you're going to
[57:41] fulfill a scripture anyway fulfill
[57:42] Revelations 3:21 to him that overcometh
[57:45] will I grant to sit with me in my Throne
[57:48] if you're going to fulfill a scripture
[57:49] why don't we fulfill Revelations 19 the
[57:51] Bible said and the bride hath made
[57:53] herself ready if you're going to fulfill
[57:55] his scure don't let your testimony be
[57:57] that of the unbeliever don't let your
[57:59] testimony be that of the scoffer or that
[58:02] of the critic or that of the make
[58:03] believer but if you're going to fulfill
[58:05] scripture let your testimony be of David
[58:07] when he said My Flesh and my heart May
[58:09] Fail but God is the strength of my heart
[58:12] and my portion
[58:13] forever the Bible covers us
[58:16] all this flesh may fail my heart May
[58:19] Fail but God is my portion this Bible is
[58:22] the only thing there is but a cow that
[58:24] covers everything in our life it answers
[58:26] aners every question that we ever have
[58:28] it's the only thing that we can ever
[58:29] live by that won't lead us astray it's
[58:31] the only place you can ever get advice
[58:33] from that it won't lead you down the
[58:34] wrong road and it's still true and it's
[58:37] still powerful and it was still inspired
[58:39] by God and it still means the same today
[58:41] it's more relevant today than it was the
[58:43] day it was wrote it's God's word and it
[58:46] it's it's something that we ought to
[58:47] read it don't ever get old you and I get
[58:49] old we get weaker in our flesh we we get
[58:52] we get down in our flesh the older we
[58:54] get but let me tell you something about
[58:55] an etern God he don't ever get old he
[58:58] don't ever get weak he don't ever lose
[59:00] his power This Is Our God he's grow he
[59:02] he's the same God that he's always been
[59:05] he's still standing in the power of His
[59:07] might doing the same work that's our
[59:09] almighty God the same Jesus that walked
[59:12] on water is walking amongst the church
[59:14] today he's never lost his
[59:16] power let me tell you if God don't get
[59:18] old the Bible says in the beginning was
[59:21] the word and the Word was with God and
[59:23] the Word was God you know what that
[59:24] tells me that if God get old then his
[59:26] word don't get old either it's still
[59:29] relevant today it still means something
[59:31] today it's the word of God but B said
[59:34] 2,800 years they've been reading this
[59:36] read by men and Priests and it never
[59:38] grows old I've been reading it for 35
[59:41] years and AG time I read it I find
[59:43] something new that I looked over the
[59:45] first time because it is inspired it is
[59:47] God in letter form it's the attributes
[59:50] of God speaking forth and it's placed on
[59:54] paper now isn't that good the attributes
[59:56] of God being placed on
[59:59] paper I thought that was good you know I
[1:00:02] think about these brothers we go out and
[1:00:04] shooting up our shooting our guns and
[1:00:06] you know you ever went and SED in a
[1:00:07] rifle but Morgan he's he's pretty good
[1:00:10] but you know if a guy goes out and he
[1:00:12] takes his rifle out there and it needs
[1:00:14] the sights tuned in and he just goes out
[1:00:15] and fires it up in the air three or four
[1:00:17] shots but a man can you fix my rifle I
[1:00:20] don't know if it's hitting or not well
[1:00:21] neither do I see he's just shooting up
[1:00:23] in the air well can you can you side it
[1:00:25] in well there's no way to to S it in
[1:00:26] because there's nothing to judge it by
[1:00:28] see so it's just shooting out in the air
[1:00:30] and say well I think that one may have
[1:00:31] went a little right I'm not sure maybe
[1:00:33] that one went a little left I I don't
[1:00:34] know but see if you really want to s in
[1:00:36] a rifle then you got to take a piece of
[1:00:38] paper and on that paper you put a Target
[1:00:40] on it so see them whenever you go to
[1:00:42] Fire and at the Target then you can look
[1:00:44] at the paper and when you see the paper
[1:00:46] you can say well you're about three
[1:00:47] inches to the right and and and you're
[1:00:49] dead center you're a little high see
[1:00:51] because it's on the paper I thought that
[1:00:53] was good cuz B said this is the
[1:00:54] attributes of God and they're placed on
[1:00:56] paper I thought isn't it something what
[1:00:58] God done he gave us a Target something
[1:01:00] that when you're trying to manifest or
[1:01:02] display the attributes of God and you
[1:01:04] really want to be a believer that God
[1:01:05] gave something to be able to Target by
[1:01:07] and something that we could hone in or
[1:01:09] we could s in by that we're not just
[1:01:11] shooting out in the air and say well
[1:01:13] maybe this will be pleasing to God and
[1:01:14] maybe maybe God likes it people act this
[1:01:16] way and maybe maybe well I may as well
[1:01:18] preach it but maybe maybe God maybe
[1:01:20] maybe god'll accept this but no but he
[1:01:22] put it on paper that we would that we
[1:01:24] would be able to read it don't ever
[1:01:25] don't ever uh uh uh take and and
[1:01:28] disregard the Bible that God has given
[1:01:30] us don't I know it's it's become less in
[1:01:32] the house of Congress and it's become
[1:01:34] less in the court of law and it's become
[1:01:36] less in the schools and it's become less
[1:01:38] in the churches but I thank God that
[1:01:40] there's still a people that would take a
[1:01:42] hold of the Bible of God's word and say
[1:01:44] it's the attributes of God it's been
[1:01:46] placed on paper it's how we can use it
[1:01:49] it's the very thing we can use as a
[1:01:51] Target to to hone our life in I I think
[1:01:53] that's what we ought to do tonight I
[1:01:55] think we ought to get back to God's
[1:01:56] Target I think we ought to get back to
[1:01:58] the Bible I think we ought to get back
[1:01:59] to a five-fold Ministry and back to
[1:02:02] Ephesians 4 and back to to people that
[1:02:04] will take hold of the word of God and
[1:02:06] manifest the attributes of
[1:02:09] God it's written on paper it's God's
[1:02:12] attributes so see he wrote it there and
[1:02:14] then he would come do you realize this
[1:02:16] is the purpose this is the purpose of
[1:02:18] every of every messenger that God has
[1:02:20] ever sent do I have just a few minutes
[1:02:22] every messenger that God has sent you
[1:02:24] realize that that that's what they were
[1:02:26] called for in every age I I think this
[1:02:28] is something that here that that
[1:02:30] although each age they battled different
[1:02:32] things there was different there was
[1:02:34] different battles different struggles
[1:02:35] and things that were going on but the
[1:02:37] answer was always the same it was the
[1:02:39] same Jesus it was the it was the same
[1:02:42] one to turn to you can see this in
[1:02:44] John's Vision in Revelations 2 he said
[1:02:46] these things saith he that holdeth the
[1:02:48] Seven Stars in his right hand remember
[1:02:50] the vision that he saw and now he's
[1:02:52] beginning to speak he said who walketh
[1:02:54] in the midst of the the seven golden
[1:02:56] candlesticks said see these seven
[1:02:58] candlesticks we know that they represent
[1:03:00] the seven Church ages but but said see
[1:03:02] there he is the savior he's walking in
[1:03:05] the midst of the churches throughout the
[1:03:06] Seven Ages what he was in the first age
[1:03:09] he is in all ages man what an image that
[1:03:12] this is Christ walking among the amongst
[1:03:14] the ages said see here he is to every
[1:03:17] believer he's the same Jesus Christ he's
[1:03:19] the same yesterday today and forever
[1:03:21] what he did once he's still doing it and
[1:03:24] he will keep on doing it why because see
[1:03:26] no well who was it see the answer is he
[1:03:28] said notice that it was Jesus Christ
[1:03:31] Alone that was walking in the midst of
[1:03:32] his churches it was he so it's not it's
[1:03:35] not some new thing or some new doctrine
[1:03:37] but it was always the same Christ It Was
[1:03:39] the Same Spirit it was it was a word to
[1:03:41] the church it was the Turning of the
[1:03:43] hearts of the people back to him said
[1:03:45] see it couldn't be nobody else it must
[1:03:47] have been him so it was he alone that
[1:03:49] worked her salvation speaking of the
[1:03:51] church it was he alone that purchased
[1:03:53] her with his own blood that's why I used
[1:03:55] say why was it him that was walking
[1:03:57] amongst this when John saw this vision
[1:03:59] and here these seven CH these seven
[1:04:01] candlesticks which represented Seven
[1:04:03] Ages he saw this one that was walking in
[1:04:05] the midst of them he said why was it him
[1:04:07] he was showing that it was him that he
[1:04:09] had power over it it was showing that it
[1:04:11] was him that had in his control he was
[1:04:14] he never left it alone he you realize he
[1:04:16] never left the church and and to wander
[1:04:19] through an age by herself he said but he
[1:04:21] Pur her with his own blood he's her Lord
[1:04:23] and her master he alone he will he will
[1:04:26] we give Glory and Honor he'll not share
[1:04:28] it with anybody it's him and him alone
[1:04:30] my a it something that wasn't Jesus and
[1:04:32] a pope standing in amongst the
[1:04:34] candlesticks it wasn't a a bishop or or
[1:04:36] an Archbishop or some Pastor or
[1:04:38] something like that or some great man
[1:04:40] but it was Jesus Christ and Jesus alone
[1:04:43] he said what this ought to show us is
[1:04:44] he'll not share this with anybody he he
[1:04:47] ain't going to share it with a pastor he
[1:04:48] won't share his glory with a pope he
[1:04:50] won't share it with a bishop he won't
[1:04:52] share it with a priest he won't share it
[1:04:53] with a prophet and he won't share it
[1:04:55] with an Ang Ang it's Jesus Christ and he
[1:04:57] alone and he's standing in the midst of
[1:05:00] the golden candlesticks here he would
[1:05:01] anoint a prophet of God to declare this
[1:05:04] under the church to recognize who it was
[1:05:06] in the midst of the church who is
[1:05:08] working in the church today he said it's
[1:05:10] he alone he don't speak and turn to the
[1:05:12] father because he was the father he
[1:05:14] didn't turn and give orders to the holy
[1:05:16] spirit because he was the Holy Spirit it
[1:05:18] was he alone the very God of creation
[1:05:21] that was walking it was the godhead
[1:05:23] dwelling in this one in this man Jesus
[1:05:25] Christ and he was walking amongst the
[1:05:27] candlesticks showing that he's in every
[1:05:29] Church age the same Jesus he said notice
[1:05:33] what he's doing it's him and and and it
[1:05:36] is his life that is flowing and
[1:05:38] pulsating in the church giving her life
[1:05:40] and without him there would be no life
[1:05:42] for salvation is of the Lord man ain't
[1:05:45] that good there was no one with him when
[1:05:47] he T down the fierceness of the Wrath of
[1:05:50] the fiery furnace he said there was no
[1:05:52] with him it was not another but it was
[1:05:54] him who hung on the cross and gave gave
[1:05:55] his blood he's the author and the
[1:05:57] finisher of our faith he's the Alpha and
[1:06:00] the Omega of our Salvation we are
[1:06:02] espoused to him and not another we don't
[1:06:04] belong to the church we belong to him it
[1:06:09] was he alone my isn't this a powerful
[1:06:12] Revelation that our relationship is
[1:06:14] between you and Jesus Christ he's who we
[1:06:17] married he he's who this is the spirit
[1:06:20] that that Christ wants you to have he
[1:06:22] said it's he alone his word is law
[1:06:24] Creeds dogmas B constitutions they have
[1:06:27] no effect on us because it is Jesus
[1:06:29] alone who walks in the midst of the
[1:06:31] churches it is God in her willing and
[1:06:34] doing of his good pleasure don't ever
[1:06:36] forget that don't ever forget that that
[1:06:40] it's Jesus Christ alone that's walking
[1:06:43] in the midst of the church don't ever
[1:06:45] forget that that it's Christ Alone that
[1:06:49] is walking in our midst do you realize
[1:06:51] you only have one relationship to God
[1:06:55] and God has one relationship to you he
[1:06:57] said it's Jesus and Jesus alone this is
[1:07:00] what John saw he said there he is in the
[1:07:03] Seven Stars in his right hand and here
[1:07:06] this right hand notice in his right hand
[1:07:08] there were seven stars now this right
[1:07:10] hand said notice it would it would
[1:07:11] signify that there was power and the
[1:07:13] authority of God I'm just going to lay
[1:07:15] this in here and I I won't hold you but
[1:07:17] there was power and authority in God it
[1:07:19] was a right hand of power this come from
[1:07:21] Psalms 44 remember David said for they
[1:07:23] got not the land in possession but by
[1:07:25] their own sword neither did their own
[1:07:27] arm save them but thy right hand thine
[1:07:30] arm thy light of thy countenance because
[1:07:32] thou had favor with them so here here
[1:07:34] here whenever John's writing this and
[1:07:35] saying it that here the Seven Stars were
[1:07:38] in his right hand you can read psalms 44
[1:07:40] and recognize what it signifies it
[1:07:42] signifies that they were in the power of
[1:07:45] God so when he had them in his right
[1:07:47] hand he said see it was his right hand
[1:07:49] of power they were seven stars and and
[1:07:52] you say well who was it well according
[1:07:53] to Revelations 1:20 he Jesus actually
[1:07:56] tells us what they were he said it was
[1:07:57] the seven Church age Messengers these
[1:08:00] Seven Stars represented the seven
[1:08:01] Messengers to the church he says see so
[1:08:03] it signifies that the power or the
[1:08:06] authority of God is behind the messenger
[1:08:09] to every age friends that's quite a
[1:08:12] revelation to have that the power and
[1:08:14] the authority of God is behind every
[1:08:16] messenger that's why whenever John saw
[1:08:18] him in this right hand of power that he
[1:08:20] was holding these Seven Stars he said it
[1:08:22] was to show that the power behind every
[1:08:24] messenger came from the power of God it
[1:08:27] was his authority it was behind them so
[1:08:28] they go forth in the fire and the power
[1:08:30] of the Holy Ghost and in the word you
[1:08:32] say you say well why why were they
[1:08:34] represented as stars there's so much in
[1:08:36] here but why were they Stars it see
[1:08:38] because Stars they actually reflect
[1:08:40] light see the stars what a star is is in
[1:08:43] our darkest hour it's when there a star
[1:08:46] shines the greatest in the you you go
[1:08:48] out in the middle of the day you can't
[1:08:49] hardly see a star you know but but you
[1:08:51] let it get closer to night and then
[1:08:53] Darkness begins to creep on and in the
[1:08:54] middle of the night when you go out away
[1:08:56] from City you ever notied that in the
[1:08:58] absence of light is when you can see
[1:08:59] stars the greatest you go out and and
[1:09:02] you live in a big city or go visit a big
[1:09:04] city they they they hardly see what we
[1:09:06] see out here in in Old Country place
[1:09:08] where we live but you can go out in one
[1:09:09] of these fields and just and see the
[1:09:11] greatness and the vastness of God and
[1:09:13] all these wonderful stars that God has
[1:09:15] made and see it's because in darkness is
[1:09:17] when is when stars shine the greatest so
[1:09:20] see so in the absence of the Su we see
[1:09:23] these stars and they're the star become
[1:09:25] greater see and it's the same way it is
[1:09:27] with Christ in the absence of the
[1:09:29] Corporal body of the s o n then God
[1:09:32] would send a star to shine in a time of
[1:09:34] Darkness see see so here they are
[1:09:37] they're represented as stars and while
[1:09:39] we're here here remember because Christ
[1:09:41] ascended so he would send back this as
[1:09:43] stars to the age they would they would
[1:09:44] light the age and so here these seven
[1:09:46] Messengers they are making God known
[1:09:49] before the people isn't it something I
[1:09:50] don't have time to get into the science
[1:09:51] of it tonight but just to I'll just lay
[1:09:53] this you can go look it up if you want
[1:09:54] to but I thought it was something that
[1:09:56] whenever you look at these Stars it took
[1:09:58] a while for science to be able to find
[1:09:59] this out whenever they had the ability
[1:10:01] to be able to look at a star but when
[1:10:03] you look at a star they actually how
[1:10:05] they identify the Sun as a star is they
[1:10:08] realize that the very things that the
[1:10:10] sun puts off the the hydrogen or the
[1:10:12] different uh uh chemicals or or elements
[1:10:15] that that are of the sun when they look
[1:10:16] through a telescope is the same elements
[1:10:19] that those Stars put off I thought isn't
[1:10:20] that something that's how they're
[1:10:22] identified as a star because in them is
[1:10:24] the very same thing that's in the sun
[1:10:26] it's the same elements that that that
[1:10:28] gives life to us is the same elements
[1:10:30] that's in every Star that's what makes
[1:10:32] it a star say see so here here here
[1:10:34] these Messengers would come it's going
[1:10:36] to be the same elements as as as Christ
[1:10:38] the same thing that was in Jesus Christ
[1:10:40] would be in his messenger or otherwise
[1:10:42] you would be able to identify well that
[1:10:44] ain't a messenger of Christ because it
[1:10:45] ain't the same thing that's got to be a
[1:10:47] moon that's got to be a planet that's
[1:10:48] got to be something else because it
[1:10:50] don't manifest the same thing that the
[1:10:52] sun puts off say see so they were stars
[1:10:56] because they reflect that same kind of
[1:10:58] light it's the same Light Of The Sun
[1:11:00] It's a lesser light of a greater light
[1:11:02] you see when ever so he sends these
[1:11:04] stars and you know I know that many
[1:11:05] would look at this today and they'd say
[1:11:07] well you know I I have a hard time
[1:11:09] receiving that you realize that people's
[1:11:11] biggest hangup the in today is to
[1:11:14] receiving the message that God sends is
[1:11:16] actually receiving the messenger that
[1:11:18] God sent to bring it it's not really the
[1:11:20] message itself it's because you say that
[1:11:22] a messenger brought it but you realize I
[1:11:24] I I can say this openly that I Reed the
[1:11:27] messenger that God sent how many can say
[1:11:28] that I received the messenger that God
[1:11:31] sent let me tell you why I can say that
[1:11:32] so boldly because Jesus said in John
[1:11:35] 13:20 verily I say unto you he that
[1:11:38] receiveth whomsoever I send receiveth me
[1:11:42] and he that receiveth me receiveth him
[1:11:44] that sent me so if you can't receive who
[1:11:47] God sins or who Christ would sin well
[1:11:49] then you couldn't even receive Christ so
[1:11:51] here he tells us that by receiving whom
[1:11:53] I sin that you're receiving me so it's
[1:11:55] not some foreign thing to believe that
[1:11:57] God would send somebody or he would send
[1:11:59] a a five-fold Ministry or he would send
[1:12:01] a messenger to the church here Jesus
[1:12:03] would say I'm going to send you out I'm
[1:12:05] going to anoint you I'm going to fill
[1:12:07] you with my spirit you're going to go
[1:12:09] manifest the very life the very things
[1:12:11] that I've done you shall do and people
[1:12:13] will believe on you for the works that
[1:12:14] you've done and by believing you they'll
[1:12:16] believe me think of this the very thing
[1:12:20] that they have it would manifest Jesus
[1:12:22] Christ so they speak and they act upon
[1:12:24] his authority and he stands behind them
[1:12:26] with all the power of the godhead you
[1:12:28] said well how do you know he stands
[1:12:30] behind them well let me just tell you
[1:12:31] what Jesus
[1:12:32] said Matthew 28:18 he said Jesus came
[1:12:35] and spake unto them he said all power is
[1:12:38] given unto me in heaven and earth go ye
[1:12:40] therefore and teach all nations in
[1:12:42] heaven and baptize them in in the name
[1:12:44] of the father and of the son and of the
[1:12:46] Holy Ghost teach them to observe all
[1:12:48] things whatsoever I have commanded you
[1:12:50] and lo I Am With You Always even unto
[1:12:53] the end of the world how do you know
[1:12:54] that he with them because he said I will
[1:12:56] be with you always even unto the end of
[1:12:59] the world said see what was it it was to
[1:13:01] the consummation of all ages to the end
[1:13:03] of the world he said I will be with them
[1:13:06] so it didn't matter if it was a
[1:13:07] messenger 2,000 years ago if it's a
[1:13:10] messenger today Jesus said I'll be with
[1:13:12] you until the end of the world why would
[1:13:15] he tell the disciple I know what the the
[1:13:17] the the churches say the church world
[1:13:19] says well he was just telling that to
[1:13:21] his disciples why would he tell his
[1:13:22] disciples those those few that were with
[1:13:25] him him that I'll be with you till the
[1:13:27] end of the world I don't know any one of
[1:13:30] them that's alive today and if you
[1:13:32] believe that join you may as well sign
[1:13:34] up with the Elvis Bunch because they but
[1:13:36] they're not alive today walking around
[1:13:37] the earth doing these works of God but
[1:13:40] he said I'll be with you until the end
[1:13:42] of the world who is he speaking of those
[1:13:44] disciples The Messengers the ones that
[1:13:47] he was sent the sent ones the ones that
[1:13:48] God sins he promised to be with them he
[1:13:51] promised in every age but says see so
[1:13:53] there they are they're full of the Holy
[1:13:55] Ghost and Faith they're on fire with the
[1:13:57] fire of God they're holding forth the
[1:13:59] word of Truth and there he stands to
[1:14:01] back them up brother Kyle not just in
[1:14:04] the first age but in every age he said
[1:14:06] think of it that's why that we don't as
[1:14:09] any believer not one of us has to look
[1:14:11] back to another age and cry in our heart
[1:14:13] and say oh Lord that I could have just
[1:14:14] lived back in that first age when the
[1:14:17] apostles were sent out he said there
[1:14:18] ain't no need to look back just look up
[1:14:21] and behold him who is even now walking
[1:14:24] in the midst of the church through all
[1:14:27] the ages it ain't time to look back it's
[1:14:30] time to look up I think that's what we
[1:14:32] ought to do tonight I think we need to
[1:14:33] quit looking back and look up and Behold
[1:14:35] Him Behold Him who is present he's the
[1:14:38] same yesterday today and forever Behold
[1:14:40] Him who promised he would be in the
[1:14:42] midst of the church Behold Him who said
[1:14:44] where two or three are GA together in my
[1:14:46] name there shall I be in the midst of
[1:14:47] him I think we need to quit looking
[1:14:49] around and looking back and looking at
[1:14:51] our problems and looking at our failures
[1:14:53] and looking at everybody else's fault
[1:14:55] and look up and behold him that is in
[1:14:57] the midst of the church today it is
[1:14:59] Jesus Christ and Christ alone and he's
[1:15:02] walking amongst the
[1:15:03] Believers we are in the spirit of him
[1:15:06] we're in the spirit of God why because
[1:15:08] the spirit of God lives in us we're not
[1:15:11] walking after the flesh we're walking
[1:15:13] after the spirit Behold Him as the music
[1:15:15] players would come tonight he said see
[1:15:19] he's in their midst and this is a good
[1:15:21] thing he said but they're not he's not
[1:15:23] in their midst as an onlooker glory to
[1:15:25] God Jesus is in our midst brother the
[1:15:28] Tom but he's not in our midst as a
[1:15:30] complacent onlooker but there he's not
[1:15:33] even in our midst as a recording angel I
[1:15:36] know that's what a lot of people do
[1:15:39] they're just kind of in the midst of
[1:15:40] everybody as a recording Angel they're
[1:15:42] just making a record of everything
[1:15:44] everybody does said but that's not what
[1:15:46] he's doing here I don't know about you
[1:15:49] but that that made me feel good but the
[1:15:51] cow that he's not he's not in our midst
[1:15:53] as a recording angel record all your
[1:15:55] faults and all your mistakes and errors
[1:15:57] and to to make a book of all your
[1:15:59] failures that's not what his purpose is
[1:16:01] here he said but here he is in our midst
[1:16:04] he stands expressing exactly what he is
[1:16:07] the life and sustainer and Giver of all
[1:16:09] good gifts to the church that's what
[1:16:11] he's doing in our midst he's walking
[1:16:14] among us we don't have to look we don't
[1:16:16] have to look back said but look up look
[1:16:20] up it's him that is walking in our midst
[1:16:23] how meaningful are those words when View
[1:16:24] vied in the light of the scripture for
[1:16:26] Christ is our life he's the life of the
[1:16:29] church she has no other life without him
[1:16:31] she's simply a religious Society or a
[1:16:33] club or a meaningless Gathering of
[1:16:35] people as a corpse Bejeweled is still a
[1:16:37] corpse so the church no matter what
[1:16:40] programs and her gracious efforts she
[1:16:41] might achieve but without a Christ
[1:16:43] without Christ it's still a corpse but
[1:16:46] with him in her midst with him
[1:16:48] motivating her she becomes to the
[1:16:50] wonderment of all his body the fullness
[1:16:53] of him that filth All In
[1:16:55] and this very hour he is walking in the
[1:16:57] midst of the last ages golden
[1:16:59] Candlestick IM this something here we
[1:17:01] are represented we we have a Candlestick
[1:17:03] in our age but in the last age in the
[1:17:06] midst of our Candlestick that same Jesus
[1:17:08] is
[1:17:09] Walking In This Very hour what he was
[1:17:12] then as he walked in the first stage
[1:17:14] even he is now in this last stage he's
[1:17:16] the same yesterday today and forever
[1:17:20] want you to stand to your feet
[1:17:22] tonight the golden candlesticks
[1:17:25] here we stand so
[1:17:28] pure can I read this as I close says see
[1:17:32] why would he use a Candlestick to type
[1:17:34] this he said see this is what Moses used
[1:17:36] when he talked about a
[1:17:37] Candlestick in Exodus he said remember
[1:17:40] what God told him to put in the
[1:17:41] Tabernacle said Thou shalt make a
[1:17:43] Candlestick of pure gold and a beaten
[1:17:45] work shall the Candlestick be made
[1:17:47] shafts branches and bowls and knops and
[1:17:49] flowers shall be the same it'll be a
[1:17:52] beaten
[1:17:53] work this is what God demanded that this
[1:17:56] Candlestick he said see the True Church
[1:17:58] of Jesus Christ the bride is likened to
[1:18:01] pure gold he's been made more than
[1:18:03] conquerors if you want to said the True
[1:18:05] Church of Jesus Christ the bride is
[1:18:07] likened to pure gold and her
[1:18:09] righteousness is his righteousness and
[1:18:11] her attributes are his own glorious
