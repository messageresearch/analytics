[38:55] Galatians the sixth chapter I'm sorry
[38:58] Galatians the 3
[39:13] chapter this will be Galatians 3 and
[39:21] 26 and the Bible says for ye are all the
[39:26] children of God by faith in Christ
[39:30] Jesus for as
[39:32] many of you as have been baptized into
[39:37] Christ have put on Christ is that not a
[39:40] good scripture amen you put on
[39:44] Christ there is neither Jew nor Greek
[39:47] there is neither Bond nor
[39:50] free there is neither male nor
[39:53] female for ye are all one in Christ
[39:57] Jesus
[39:58] and if you be Christ then ye Abraham's
[40:02] seed and heirs according to the promise
[40:06] now let's go to the fourth
[40:10] chapter and uh I believe it's four and
[40:15] six I believe it
[40:18] is and because ye are Sons God hath sent
[40:22] forth his Spirit of his son into your
[40:25] hearts crying Abba Father
[40:28] wherefore Thou Art no more a servant but
[40:31] a son and if a son then an heir of God
[40:36] through Christ
[40:39] amen tonight I don't know if they took
[40:42] prayer request but someone handed me a
[40:44] prayer request didn't have a way to get
[40:46] it up here and we're going to go to the
[40:47] Lord in prayer with uh before we let you
[40:50] be seated and uh those request turned in
[40:53] to please pray for brother Jared hm's
[40:55] family they're sick and
[40:59] so as we go go to the Lord let's just
[41:01] keep them on our hearts kind precious
[41:04] Heavenly Father Lord we love you tonight
[41:06] and we thank you Lord we serve such a
[41:09] mighty God lord and you're so mindful
[41:12] your children and God I believe tonight
[41:15] that they come out on a Wednesday night
[41:18] Lord and I pray God that you'd help us
[41:20] to speak something to encourage them and
[41:23] God I just I believe that your word
[41:24] always encourages the Bible talked about
[41:27] where it was read or heard whether it
[41:29] would be an encouragement to the people
[41:32] Lord but I pray God that you're let the
[41:34] spirit of God be come down and begin to
[41:36] Quicken it Lord to their hearts and if
[41:38] there be one that down tonight Lord not
[41:41] know which way to turn Lord whatever
[41:43] they have need of I know that you're a
[41:45] God that knows and you could speak to
[41:46] them and Lord at brother Jared and his
[41:48] family tonight you look and see where
[41:50] they're at we believe that you're a God
[41:52] that still answers prayer and Lord I
[41:54] pray you'd be with them in Jesus
[41:56] precious name we ask ask it amen you can
[41:58] be seated if you'd
[42:00] like amen just
[42:03] a I don't mean this to say that I'm
[42:06] taking it lightly but just a Wednesday
[42:09] night kind of a Wednesday night lesson
[42:11] that maybe would ask the Lord to bless
[42:14] his word and help us to speak something
[42:17] and be an encouragement and y'all
[42:20] forgive me tugging at this I don't know
[42:21] if I've told y'all before I know I told
[42:23] about Brother Davis I thought they had
[42:25] quit public hangings but W with this tie
[42:27] on I think they're still doing
[42:30] it so amen the Lord's good and IID meant
[42:34] to say something the other day I know it
[42:35] been quite a while back my my sister um
[42:38] my oldest sister Deborah some of you may
[42:40] remember that uh she'd went through a
[42:42] lot of problems and I had prayed turned
[42:45] in a request and we had prayed for her
[42:46] here and she'd had a lot of problems
[42:49] with her foot and and uh the uh
[42:51] infection and stuff had got in the bone
[42:53] and and uh now she's had a time with it
[42:56] but she went to the doctor the other day
[42:57] and the doctor told her he said there's
[42:59] good news he said there is no infection
[43:01] in the bone so man praise the Lord for
[43:04] that man we God's so good to us
[43:08] but I begin to
[43:11] uh I begin to think the past few weeks I
[43:15] preached on this years ago and preached
[43:17] on this some and it's always been an
[43:19] encouragement to me that you know I I
[43:22] want to encourage God's children because
[43:24] not that it makes us bad people brother
[43:26] Joel but
[43:27] sometimes as humans we begin to forget
[43:30] who we
[43:32] are man we we begin to forget what we
[43:35] have at our
[43:36] disposal man we we begin to forget that
[43:39] we serve a God that you know we let the
[43:41] cares of Life start coming in on us and
[43:43] pressures and you get under pressure and
[43:45] Satan he wants to just keep laying the
[43:47] pressure to you and and we begin to
[43:49] forget that that David said that forget
[43:51] not God and all his
[43:53] benefits amen I'm telling you there's
[43:56] benefit in serving God Amen he's got
[44:00] lots of benefits man the other
[44:02] night I I know there was many and
[44:05] there's more but I just it stuck out to
[44:07] me I hope you don't care for me saying
[44:08] some sister sh kind but she come up here
[44:11] I'm telling you we got benefits and
[44:13] serving God Amen I believe I believe I
[44:15] serve a God that can deliver amen and
[44:18] when I prayed I prayed that way I prayed
[44:20] that God deliver amen we're not serving
[44:22] some dead God somewhere off in a corner
[44:25] that's been shoved over all the world
[44:26] put him that way but we serve a real God
[44:29] that that can that can solve real
[44:31] problems amen man I seen a sign one time
[44:34] and probably many of you might have seen
[44:36] it on a church and I always just like to
[44:38] you're such a good crowd to speak to and
[44:41] and y'all just let me speak my heart all
[44:43] and I appreciate that and that's what
[44:44] I'm going to do tonight just just ask
[44:46] the Lord to to help me and to encourage
[44:49] and to just say something that would
[44:50] cause you to to maybe draw closer to him
[44:53] and man that'd be our aim and but I saw
[44:56] a sign on a church one time and it said
[44:59] if God is your co-pilot swap seeds amen
[45:03] man I'm going to tell you there' be some
[45:05] troubled waters in our life and I don't
[45:07] want God being my co-pilot but he needs
[45:09] to be the pilot amen he knows the
[45:11] direction that you need to go amen and
[45:14] you know people get things uh uh I'm I'm
[45:17] going to get to this but this this kind
[45:19] of on my heart people get things where
[45:21] you know they they don't know which way
[45:23] to turn don't know which way to go but
[45:25] God is still a God that he has got
[45:27] direction for
[45:28] you and and brother BR made a statement
[45:31] one time he said that clear signs was no
[45:35] sign of God's approval as of Cloudy
[45:38] signs was no sign of his
[45:41] disapproval so you look and see sometime
[45:43] you know the old Pentecostal idea was
[45:45] somebody was having problems and I
[45:47] wonder what they done wrong amen and and
[45:49] you know there was a man one time that
[45:51] we all look to over that his name was
[45:53] job and he hadn't done anything brother
[45:55] job but yet he went through a great
[45:57] trial cuz God knew that he would stand
[45:59] the
[46:01] test amen so we know that we serve a God
[46:04] that's
[46:06] Mindful and tonight I hadn't even took a
[46:10] thought but I kind of wanted to to
[46:12] preach to you just a few thing few
[46:13] minutes on an heir of all
[46:17] things amen and and this is that's why I
[46:20] want to lay the part in there we begin
[46:21] to forget that who we are and and we're
[46:25] you know I'm I'm proud that I'm I'm a
[46:28] son of Connie and Howard
[46:30] mcgar amen I love my parents and I I'm
[46:34] proud to be their son but you know what
[46:36] I'm even prouder that I'm a son of of of
[46:39] of God Almighty amen amen I'm I'm
[46:43] thankful that he chose me to be a
[46:45] son amen we ought to live and walk God
[46:48] helped me to always live and walk and
[46:50] and and remember that I'm a Son of God
[46:52] and man we ought to see want to see
[46:55] people saved and amen as we was up here
[46:57] the other night I wanted to tell this I
[46:59] was telling brother Joe in the back and
[47:00] there was so many people coming up for
[47:02] prayer for different things and and I
[47:04] was telling brother Mark too that my
[47:06] neck I don't have much neck problems but
[47:08] my neck had been bothering me real bad
[47:10] and and um I uh there was so many people
[47:13] coming up for prayer that I just didn't
[47:15] find a place to jump in and get prayed
[47:17] for and I thought well God you'll take
[47:19] care of it man because I want to make
[47:21] sure all his children was taken care of
[47:24] and pray for him and I told brother Joe
[47:25] I said I got home
[47:27] and I just decided to turn my head and I
[47:30] pushed my head around and my neck popped
[47:32] and it went back in and amen I just
[47:34] believe I've never had my neck I don't
[47:35] even think pop like that before by
[47:37] pushing on it myself but my neck went
[47:39] back in place and I think him he's so
[47:41] good and mindful and i' I've had him
[47:43] take care of little things that you know
[47:45] might not even be important to nobody
[47:47] else but God knows what you God knows
[47:50] what you are when you're at home and
[47:51] ain't nobody else
[47:53] around he knows he knows the feelings
[47:56] that you have and he knows your ups and
[47:58] your Downs he knows your ins and your
[48:00] outs man for some reason I can't get
[48:02] started on my sermon brother Joe but it
[48:05] kind of has to do with anyway and I hope
[48:07] sister Tammy don't care for me telling
[48:08] this but she told me this years
[48:11] ago I don't even know if she remembers
[48:13] telling
[48:15] me I won't go into detail but she said
[48:18] that she had got real down and and
[48:21] nobody the reason why I don't care to
[48:23] tell that on her is cuz I'll put myself
[48:25] in there too I've got down for I don't
[48:27] think any of us brother Joe can point a
[48:29] finger at somebody else say well they
[48:30] was down but she said she'd got real
[48:32] down over something and she was laying
[48:35] in bed and she even want to get out of
[48:36] bed that morning and if I tell this
[48:38] wrong sister Tammy you correct me later
[48:40] but I'll get it close the real meaning
[48:43] of the end of it she said she was laying
[48:46] there and she reached over and got a
[48:48] hold of the Bible and opened it
[48:50] up and she thought I don't even want to
[48:52] get up and I'm feeling sad and down and
[48:55] out she said she opened it up the first
[48:58] scripture she started reading was a rise
[49:00] and shine for th light has come and the
[49:02] glory of the Lord is upon you she said
[49:04] you know what she said I felt like the
[49:06] Lord was telling me to get out of bed
[49:08] amen he knows what you have need
[49:12] of
[49:14] [Applause]
[49:16] Amen oh I love him tonight I'm thankful
[49:20] brother Joe when he could have cast me
[49:22] out and maybe a lot of people would have
[49:24] and and so I'll tell you what he just to
[49:26] renegate anyway won't have nothing to do
[49:27] with him but go I'm glad that Jesus
[49:29] Christ never give up on me amen I didn't
[49:32] deserve him to start out with I didn't
[49:35] deserve him when I made the first
[49:36] mistake I didn't deserve him when I made
[49:38] the third mistake but guess what he
[49:41] still forgive me of it amen I thankful
[49:43] we serve a god they say we serve a god a
[49:45] second chances I say that we serve a God
[49:48] sometimes a third fourth and fifth and
[49:50] sixth
[49:51] chances
[49:54] amen W let's see if I can get to this
[49:57] cuz I don't have all night so amen I
[50:00] always say I'm not long winding the
[50:01] older I get the harder it is to to bring
[50:04] it down to little bit but hey man we're
[50:06] going to speak when we get done if we
[50:07] have to we'll we'll preach on the rest
[50:09] of it later
[50:10] but and I won't charge you nothing for
[50:12] that first part man that just be all
[50:16] free but there's good news because the
[50:18] second part's free too I'm not going to
[50:19] charge you for it
[50:22] amen so we find out that in the script
[50:27] that in in Genesis that
[50:33] Abraham we all look to him you know as
[50:36] Father Abraham been looked at for years
[50:38] and we look back to him and the father
[50:41] of faith and but you
[50:43] know Abraham we I I kind of wonder
[50:47] sometimes and and if if maybe we look as
[50:51] a human we look at people in the Bible
[50:53] as
[50:54] superheroes and think well they did it
[50:57] because Abraham was a
[51:00] superhero well Abraham wasn't he was a
[51:02] man like me and you in fact he many of
[51:06] you probably know this I know a lot of
[51:08] you are Bible uh studies and and listen
[51:11] to tapes and and but Abraham was just he
[51:14] was carry packing an idol around he was
[51:16] he'd come up out of the uh land of CHA I
[51:19] believe the city of ER I believe brother
[51:20] B said and the Bible says and and he he
[51:23] he come up packing an idol he was
[51:25] nothing but God called him
[51:28] and you know what I like is is when God
[51:31] sat down with him and told him you know
[51:34] uh what he was going to do and Abraham
[51:37] he found God faithful and believed God
[51:39] like many of you have done amen you
[51:42] found God faithful and you come out and
[51:45] believed what God Said Amen that's the
[51:47] reason why God's blessed you amen we
[51:50] might not have a lot of money sometimes
[51:52] we might not be able to pay off our
[51:53] bills all the time but I'm telling you
[51:54] you're blessed people tonight amen if
[51:57] you believe this message you believe
[51:59] Jesus Christ you are a blessed people
[52:01] tonight you said brother I don't know if
[52:04] I'll be able to pay my electric bill
[52:05] next week well I take I serve a God that
[52:07] can help you pay that too but we're
[52:09] still
[52:10] blessed so anyway Abraham God had come
[52:14] to him after he had separated himself
[52:16] many of you know and I won't take a lot
[52:17] of time with it but he had separated
[52:20] himself from lot and lot went down into
[52:24] Sodom excuse me Lord had went down into
[52:27] Sodom
[52:29] and I tell you what he was down there
[52:32] and he got around the sin but I'll tell
[52:35] you sin will take you further than you
[52:36] want to
[52:37] go amen but Abraham went
[52:42] out he gave lot the choice
[52:46] Direction he went out and got out into a
[52:48] drought position or drought
[52:50] situation man didn't look like much my
[52:53] probably little old bony arms and and
[52:56] and a beard and and his hair was getting
[52:59] M I think bald brother BR said man he
[53:02] didn't look like much but God come to
[53:05] him and he told him he said
[53:07] Abraham he said now that you've obeyed
[53:09] me he said I want you to look to the
[53:12] north and look to the South and you look
[53:15] to the East and you look to the West
[53:17] because you own every bit of it I give
[53:20] it to you I'm making you an air to
[53:23] everything that I
[53:24] promised amen walk through the land what
[53:27] go go hither and to and walk through all
[53:29] of it walk through the breath of it cuz
[53:31] I give it all to you brother
[53:34] Travis amen may I interject this right
[53:36] here that tonight you say well brother D
[53:40] I don't have no
[53:43] land amen look to Genesis maybe look
[53:46] over in Malachi Matthew over to
[53:49] Revelations I give it all to you you're
[53:52] air to every bit of it tonight
[53:57] so Abraham owned it all and I thought
[54:00] that was something how that he said
[54:02] Palestine belonged to him and amen you
[54:04] got different ones fighting over it and
[54:07] this one's fighting over it and they're
[54:08] wanting this land and and there's
[54:10] turmoil all over but I'm I'm getting
[54:13] ahead of myself but while I've got it on
[54:14] my mind I wanted to put this in there
[54:17] that it may not look like that that the
[54:19] God's people's much but I told brother
[54:22] Mark W go where God is the minority Bec
[54:26] comes the
[54:29] majority so it may not look much like
[54:32] people to to people you know you sisters
[54:35] that wear your hair long and and you
[54:37] wear dresses and people look at you kind
[54:39] of funny and well what what's all that
[54:40] about I mean why do you do that what do
[54:42] you what do you got I mean what the but
[54:44] I'm telling you you own it all tonight
[54:47] if you've received the baptism of the
[54:49] Holy Ghost it don't matter you say well
[54:51] brother how do you know I'm going to
[54:53] because don't the bible say that the
[54:54] meek shall inherit the earth
[54:57] amen so you own it all anyway so let
[54:59] them fight and fuss over it because one
[55:01] of these days you're going to walk out
[55:03] brother Joe you're going to walk out an
[55:06] air in the Millennium to this thing amen
[55:09] just as sure as I'm standing on this
[55:11] platform right here you're going to walk
[55:13] out one day it'll be a reality brother

[55:18] holler at you but it's a truth anyway am
[55:21] man amen y y'all my a man Corner up here
[55:24] right now I appreciate it
[55:27] amen but you're a to it
[55:30] all so
[55:32] Abraham he was air to all of it and one
[55:35] day these Kings had come up I can't
[55:39] remember the land they'd come out of but
[55:41] it don't matter but these Kings had come
[55:43] up and had this great army with them and
[55:46] they come in and they come into Sodom
[55:48] and they took lot and all his family and
[55:51] took him out took them away and somebody
[55:54] come to Abraham and said Abraham
[55:57] somebody Abra you know lot was Abraham's
[56:00] nephew and said you know he said uh they
[56:03] come in and these Kings have and they've
[56:04] taken over these cities and maybe had a
[56:06] couple thousand trained men or so and
[56:10] and and they took lot and they they'll
[56:12] take them all his family and everything
[56:13] they'll all be slaves and and they'll
[56:16] they'll you know like Satan wanted to do
[56:17] to you he want to make you a
[56:21] slave but Abraham with the spirit of
[56:24] Christ on him brother Joe he even though
[56:27] lot had backslid and done wrong Abraham
[56:30] W he said you know what that's part of
[56:33] my inheritance and I'm going after
[56:35] it this is the part I'm telling you that
[56:37] I don't believe that Abraham sister
[56:39] Corine I don't believe that he knew one
[56:43] I ow to how he was fixing to go take
[56:45] that back if you would have wanted him
[56:47] to explain it he couldn't explained it
[56:50] no more than anything he had a few
[56:52] servants one place I think the Bible
[56:54] says I may be right brother Jonah it
[56:56] like 318
[56:58] servants they were servants you know
[57:00] what they did they didn't go out and
[57:02] practice War they were sheep herders
[57:05] they took care of the cattle and
[57:06] everything that Abraham had they were
[57:08] servants carried the
[57:10] water but you know what Abraham took God
[57:13] at his word again and he said you know
[57:15] what lot is a part of my inheritance I
[57:19] own all of palestine's all of mine as
[57:21] far as I can see and these Kings come up
[57:24] and took it but I'm going to go take him
[57:25] back
[57:27] so you know what he did he wasn't a man
[57:30] of war he went and he had to dig up some
[57:32] old rusty knife somewhere that maybe
[57:35] hadn't been took out in a while and he
[57:37] tried to arm himself and maybe his
[57:38] servants had some more Rusty knives and
[57:41] and uh maybe some pics and shovels and
[57:43] stuff they weren't trained Men of War go
[57:46] Abraham wasn't looking at the pics and
[57:48] shovels he was looking at the promise of
[57:53] God do you care just for a minute if I
[57:55] maybe do like a 2024 version of maybe
[57:59] how it
[58:02] went Abraham in the tent I can see him
[58:04] and I tell you what that enemy's come in
[58:08] and he's took my part of my inheritance
[58:10] I'm going after
[58:12] it Sarah where is my knife at I can't
[58:17] find nothing in this tent no more did
[58:19] you hide my knife somewhere he dug out
[58:22] some old rusty knife amen he wasn't
[58:25] looking at that knife he he was looking
[58:26] at the promise I tell I'll go down there
[58:29] I'll slay every one of them Kings I'll
[58:30] do whatever it takes to bring my brother
[58:33] back you know what he did he armed
[58:36] himself he armed his servants and he
[58:37] went down there and slaughtered those
[58:40] kings and brought lot
[58:42] back amen like I said you you'll never
[58:46] make me believe that he knew he took God
[58:48] at his word it took God at his promise
[58:50] just like me and you have to
[58:53] do amen
[58:57] so tonight you're not an heir because
[59:01] you're worthy of
[59:04] it it wouldn't matter if my dad would
[59:07] have made me an heir if I would have
[59:09] been the biggest drunk in Arkansas it
[59:11] wouldn't have made no difference I still
[59:12] an
[59:13] air it didn't matter what you used to be
[59:16] God made you an air amen so get that out
[59:19] of your mind that you got to be worthy
[59:21] because none of us was
[59:23] worthy and I love this I love this
[59:26] meaning of this of this one on an
[59:29] air and remember a child I know this new
[59:34] age Bunch maybe not do it but in the
[59:35] Bible a child always falls air to what
[59:38] his daddy has and an heir is a person
[59:43] who
[59:44] inherits or has a right to inheritance
[59:48] in the property of
[59:52] another following the latter's death
[59:56] does that not sound like us amen there
[59:59] was one D you know they said one time
[1:00:02] that uh I always always enjoyed this
[1:00:04] story I always like this story for the
[1:00:06] sake of this message that one time there

[1:00:29] die and I'm going to the reading of the
[1:00:32] wheel amen she got down there to church

[1:05:59] testified one time he said Satan started
[1:06:01] pushing him around and and he started
[1:06:02] telling him that he was lost and started
[1:06:06] telling just getting him nervous and
[1:06:08] upset you know Satan loves to get you
[1:06:09] all upset and get your nerves all worked
[1:06:11] up and then he can kind of work on your
[1:06:13] feelings cuz remember Satan is a spirit
[1:06:16] too so if he can get if he can start

[1:06:41] sick and tired of hearing what Satan had
[1:06:44] to

[1:06:47] and he said Satan I may be lost I don't
[1:06:51] know but he said I'll tell you this much
[1:06:53] as long as I'm here I'm going to serve
[1:06:54] him anyway
[1:06:56] if he cast me off into hell I'll serve
[1:06:59] him he said the he said I'm telling you
[1:07:02] the spirit of God broke that thing he
[1:07:04] said I didn't have no more problems with
[1:07:06] it amen sometimes you just got to be
[1:07:08] bold you know you don't wait till you
[1:07:10] feel better start confessing that you're
[1:07:12] healed or whatever you have now amen no

[1:07:33] love to talk about him because you know
[1:07:35] what did you know brother BR said you
[1:07:37] you say you might say well brother Dave
[1:07:39] you're talking about all these people
[1:07:40] that you know I'm just a lay member well
[1:07:45] I'll talk about a lay member tonight cuz
[1:07:46] shamgar wasn't a prophet he wasn't
[1:07:48] anything extra he was just he was just a
[1:07:50] lay
[1:07:51] member but you know what he was he was
[1:07:54] circumcised
[1:07:56] amen he had a promise of
[1:07:58] God Amen so shamgar he's down there and
[1:08:02] he looks over and his wife was all
[1:08:05] skinny and and her dress was all
[1:08:08] tattered and they didn't have any money
[1:08:10] to buy anything and his kids was about
[1:08:12] half starved and because just as he'd
[1:08:14] get his crops in every year eron come to
[1:08:16] the Philistines and take what he had
[1:08:19] just about like just about the time you
[1:08:20] get a little extra $100 in the bank and
[1:08:23] Satan he sees it and just about the time
[1:08:26] you think you're going to get ahead and
[1:08:27] then your car breaks down you know
[1:08:29] Thursday after that service after all
[1:08:31] that you know what first thing about
[1:08:33] happened that day somebody backed into
[1:08:35] the side of my
[1:08:37] truck just seemed like everything went
[1:08:39] wrong but you know what brother Joel and
[1:08:41] I ain't saying it cuz I'm here tonight
[1:08:42] I'm saying it cuz I said it up there I
[1:08:44] said you know what if that Satan upset
[1:08:46] at me because we was down and we was
[1:08:49] enjoying the things of God in the
[1:08:51] presence of the Holy Ghost That Old
[1:08:53] truck's going to burn anyway one of
[1:08:54] these days but what you do for Christ
[1:08:57] will last
[1:09:02] forever I'm an heir
[1:09:05] tonight amen you're an heir tonight to
[1:09:07] claim your loved
[1:09:08] ones amen you got a loved one you got to
[1:09:11] love on that's Wayward don't try to
[1:09:13] start reasoning it out just do what he
[1:09:16] said just claim them just say Lord
[1:09:18] that's part of my inheritance and I
[1:09:19] claim them
[1:09:21] tonight man because you know you well I
[1:09:25] I even I even uh I'm an heir of death I
[1:09:28] don't death don't hold no no uh nothing
[1:09:31] over a Believer amen you even control
[1:09:34] death when you death just takes you into
[1:09:37] the presence of God so there there ain't
[1:09:41] there's nothing that there's everything
[1:09:42] the Bible says all things are under his
[1:09:45] feet now I'm not real smart but all
[1:09:47] things means all
[1:09:49] things sometimes I just need to stop and
[1:09:52] think and I have to say you know what
[1:09:54] tired of Satan pushing me
[1:09:56] around man old shamgar he looked
[1:09:59] around he didn't have too much to fight
[1:10:02] with would have been nice for he could
[1:10:04] to turn around and said oh man look at
[1:10:07] that AR-15 sitting there woo man that
[1:10:10] thing's got 30 round mags and that other
[1:10:13] one's got a 60 round drum mag and I tell
[1:10:15] you I can fight this thing I'll wait
[1:10:16] until they invent that and then I'll
[1:10:18] fight no shamgar looked around and see
[1:10:21] what he had he said you know what I'm
[1:10:23] sick and tired of that just like the
[1:10:26] devil coming in and robbing me I'm sick
[1:10:28] and tired of it my wife may not be able
[1:10:31] to last my children may not be able to
[1:10:33] last another winner he reached over
[1:10:36] grabbed an ox goat a stick with a brass
[1:10:39] knob on the end of it he jumped out the
[1:10:41] window and went out there and beat down
[1:10:43] 600 Philistines you know why because he
[1:10:46] be to think I'm circumcised I'm in the
[1:10:49] promise tonight just like you are you're
[1:10:51] in the promise tonight sister Joyce
[1:10:56] amen what you have need of you're air to
[1:10:58] it like I said not that we deserve it
[1:11:02] but because Christ made us in air he
[1:11:04] said he promised Abraham he said thy
[1:11:07] seed not as many but as one Christ Jesus
[1:11:10] and us being dead in Christ makes us hes

[1:11:30] of y'all know him but if you do oh
[1:11:32] brother Mike Patterson used to come back

[1:11:37] something good just a a good spirit
[1:11:40] about him and and uh just just a good
[1:11:43] man and always loved to hear him preach
[1:11:45] and he was telling something years ago
[1:11:47] and he said you know he said there was a
[1:11:49] man in my church and he said he got in a
[1:11:53] bind and
[1:11:57] didn't know what he was going to do and
[1:11:59] he said I I prayed about it and he Saidi
[1:12:01] had the money to help him I believe he
[1:12:04] said but he said I just I felt checked
[1:12:06] about
[1:12:07] it so he said we was told him he said
[1:12:09] well brother he said we'll be praying
[1:12:12] and so he said that it rocked on there
[1:12:15] and I think one night his wife was
[1:12:17] saying something about it honey I don't
[1:12:18] know what we're going to do and he said
[1:12:21] you know I don't either honey but he
[1:12:22] said you know what he said the Bible

[1:12:32] needs to go sell a few cattle and then
[1:12:35] I'll have the money to do what we need
[1:12:37] to
[1:12:37] do he said that night they were sitting
[1:12:40] there and there was a knock on the door
[1:12:41] brother Joe and he went to the door he
[1:12:43] said A man was standing there and he
[1:12:44] said hey he said I live down the road
[1:12:47] here he said the Lord spoke to me and he
[1:12:49] said I felt led to go sell a few of my
[1:12:51] cattle and he said I want to bring you
[1:12:53] some of the money he
[1:12:56] amen sometimes you just you can't figure
[1:12:58] God out amen so he just he made the
[1:13:02] statement God needs sell a few of his
[1:13:03] cattle and he did brought him the money
[1:13:06] amen God like he makes a way when there
[1:13:08] don't seem like there's no
[1:13:10] way
[1:13:13] amen but you
[1:13:15] know if tonight if if someone left me
[1:13:20] a if someone left me a house or
[1:13:22] something you know and said you know
[1:13:24] someone come and said hey the lawyers
[1:13:25] want to talk to you that so and so left
[1:13:29] you a house and you know what brother
[1:13:31] Joe I'd want to go I'd want to go up in
[1:13:33] in that house and I'd kind of want to
[1:13:34] look around brother Mark and I'd want to
[1:13:36] see what I inherited I would wouldn't be
[1:13:40] nothing wrong with that I'd want to look
[1:13:41] over and you know after I heard it
[1:13:44] somebody was telling Dad one time I
[1:13:47] don't want to sound greedy but he said
[1:13:49] they went and they inherited some
[1:13:52] property from their family I don't know
[1:13:53] if it's their dad or who and uncle or
[1:13:55] something said he went over and they
[1:13:58] looked through the house and they got
[1:13:59] everything and they went in and clean
[1:14:01] course it was he was living there and
[1:14:02] everything was there and he went through
[1:14:03] and they checked everything they threw
[1:14:05] stuff
[1:14:06] away come to find out later he had hid
[1:14:09] some money in a cereal box and they
[1:14:11] threw it away I might check in the
[1:14:13] cereal
[1:14:15] box you leave me a house I might come
[1:14:17] over and go man they didn't seem like
[1:14:18] they had nothing but let's look in the
[1:14:19] cereal box there might be some cash in
[1:14:22] there amen it sounds funny but it's a
[1:14:26] truth so you get down now just we look
[1:14:30] over here and I don't mean to make the
[1:14:31] word of God sound like a Serial box
[1:14:33] because it's not but look in here and
[1:14:35] find out what you own amen M maybe in
[1:14:39] that house there might be some shelves
[1:14:41] up there that you can't see sister Lori
[1:14:44] might be above you know I'm pretty tall
[1:14:45] and I can see a lot but there's places
[1:14:47] in houses I I can't see so you know what
[1:14:49] I might do I get me a ladder or
[1:14:51] something and pull over everybody maybe
[1:14:53] the a kitchen chair or something and
[1:14:54] pull over I want to look up on the
[1:14:56] shelves and stuff make sure there ain't
[1:14:57] nothing there man I want to see what I
[1:15:00] own I want to see what was left to me
[1:15:03] amen I think we ought to look in God's
[1:15:05] word and find out what he left us
[1:15:07] because I'm AED every bit of it so if
[1:15:10] there's a promise there I want to know
[1:15:11] what it is amen and accept what God give
[1:15:15] me amen
[1:15:17] so man you might need a little ladder I
[1:15:20] might need a little ladder of prayer I
[1:15:22] might read the Bible but I might need a
[1:15:23] little ladder of prayer to me up just a
[1:15:25] little bit higher where God could
[1:15:27] Quicken that word to me sister
[1:15:29] Eve man I know many of you Christians
[1:15:32] and you know what I'm talking about when
[1:15:33] you don't know which way to turn and you
[1:15:35] get down and you begin to
[1:15:37] pray I tell you I feel like telling this
[1:15:40] and I'm going to tell this may sound
[1:15:44] strange but one night I woke up in the
[1:15:45] middle of the
[1:15:47] night and I need to use the restroom and
[1:15:49] I got
[1:15:51] up and there was an evil spirit
[1:15:55] like in the
[1:15:56] room and I thought man that's
[1:15:59] strange didn't know what it was you know
[1:16:01] I was kind of tired and sleepy little
[1:16:03] bit I'm not real sleepy headed when I
[1:16:04] wake up but you're a little disoriented
[1:16:06] and I thought what is that and it was
[1:16:08] almost it wasn't audible but almost an
[1:16:10] audible voice just almost whispered and
[1:16:13] said you're going to
[1:16:16] die brother Joel went to the restroom
[1:16:19] and I come back I didn't know I mean I
[1:16:20] didn't know what to do but I I knew that
[1:16:23] prayer changed things
[1:16:25] and I knelt down beside my bed and I
[1:16:27] just started praying and I said Lord I
[1:16:29] don't know what that is but I know it's
[1:16:31] not you and I just began to pray to the
[1:16:33] Lord and it it wasn't just a few seconds
[1:16:37] and you could almost feel one move as
[1:16:39] the other moved in when the presence of
[1:16:41] God moved in it took all that spooky
[1:16:43] demon Spirit Away it left right there
[1:16:47] and he didn't come back either
[1:16:49] [Applause]
[1:16:57] even when I'd get down and pray about
[1:16:58] this sermon I didn't know brother Joe
[1:17:00] was he he what he preached last week I
[1:17:02] know it wasn't just like be mentioned
[1:17:04] about being an air and things and I
[1:17:05] already had that on my heart and I
[1:17:07] wanted to kind of preach on it and not
[1:17:08] get down and pray and just feel the
[1:17:10] presence the Lord start moving so I just
[1:17:12] can't do anything but obey what the Lord
[1:17:14] seem as good to the Lord but I tell you
[1:17:17] I love him there's times that he's given
[1:17:19] me things I didn't deserve amen he's
[1:17:23] given me he's helped me S I didn't
[1:17:25] deserve the help but you know what he
[1:17:26] did
[1:17:29] anyway man there was a there was a story
[1:17:33] told one time
[1:17:34] that about Alexander the Great I'm sure
[1:17:38] everybody here has heard of Alexander
[1:17:39] the Great and they said that one time
[1:17:43] there was an old
[1:17:44] beggar he come to him and he
[1:17:48] said he said I I'm getting old and he
[1:17:52] said he he was just a beggar he said I
[1:17:54] don't have any place to go and he said
[1:17:58] you
[1:17:59] know I I wish that you'd give me and and
[1:18:03] he said I have a daughter and I have a
[1:18:04] son he said I don't have anything for
[1:18:06] him and he said I'm asking you if you
[1:18:09] would give me a diary for my
[1:18:11] daughter and an education for my son and
[1:18:14] he said I'd like to have a little bit of
[1:18:16] land with a house where I'll have a
[1:18:17] place to to go in my old age he said I'm
[1:18:21] just an old beggar and I don't deserve
[1:18:23] it but he said I want to ask you for
[1:18:26] that and Alexander the Great said I'll
[1:18:28] give you everything that you asked for
[1:18:30] he said I'll give you the DI he said
[1:18:32] I'll get your son a great education and
[1:18:34] he said I have land and a house where
[1:18:36] you have something to leave them and
[1:18:39] place to live until you pass somebody
[1:18:42] was standing there when he walked off
[1:18:43] and he said
[1:18:45] why would you grant that old beggar all
[1:18:49] that he asked he's just nothing but an
[1:18:51] old beggar and Alexander said you know
[1:18:54] what
[1:18:55] he said I'm tired of people nickeling
[1:18:57] Diamond me when I'm a great king and can
[1:18:59] give great gifts he said 'I finally
[1:19:02] found somebody that treated me like a
[1:19:03] king and knew that I was able to give
[1:19:06] great things and I know that sometimes
[1:19:09] we want to be humble and than oh God's
[1:19:11] not an Aaron boy and he's
[1:19:13] not but he's definitely mindful what you
[1:19:15] have need of man you get somewhere you
[1:19:18] start praying I think we ought to treat
[1:19:20] him like a king I mean I know a lot of
[1:19:23] us has heard the stories but you know
[1:19:25] brother B talked about that a little
[1:19:26] mouse being over there in those Garners
[1:19:29] in Egypt when all that grain was there
[1:19:31] and they can you imagine that little
[1:19:33] mouse going oh man I tell you I don't
[1:19:35] know if I ought to eat this seed or not
[1:19:37] because there might not be no more
[1:19:40] amen it was inexhaustable amount of
[1:19:43] grain there's no way he could ever eat
[1:19:44] it all and remember he talked about the
[1:19:47] little fish and I don't want to be the
[1:19:48] little fish in the ocean just scared to
[1:19:50] death Lord I don't know if I ought to I
[1:19:52] don't know if I ought to drink or not
[1:19:54] because I'm I will drink this ocean dry
[1:19:56] well God's greater than the ocean he's
[1:19:59] an inexhaustible like I said he's an
[1:20:01] inexhaustible Fountain tonight all you
[1:20:03] have to do is start
[1:20:06] drinking amen because we're heirs and
[1:20:09] join HS with Jesus Christ amen
[1:20:13] he's he said I love this
[1:20:18] scripture the Bible says he was wounded
[1:20:21] for our transgressions
[1:20:25] you're heir to this
[1:20:27] tonight he's bruised for our iniquity
[1:20:32] brother Joe I begin to think about that
[1:20:35] do you know what iniquity is I know you
[1:20:37] do I don't know if all of you do but you
[1:20:39] might know and can't say but if I say
[1:20:42] this wrong correct me but I believe that
[1:20:44] iniquity is to know to do something and
[1:20:47] to not do
[1:20:49] it so when Satan starts around and he
[1:20:53] says you knew better sister and do that
[1:20:56] you knew better than to do that that's
[1:20:58] why it's well guess what I ain't saying
[1:21:01] you done right I'm not saying where I've
[1:21:03] done wrong that I've Done Right CU I'm
[1:21:04] not going to say it because if it was
[1:21:05] wrong it was
[1:21:07] wrong but I'm an heir to this and you're
[1:21:09] an heir to this he was bruised for our
[1:21:20] iniquity don't you love him
[1:21:23] tonight when you have been cast out and
[1:21:25] there was not a way to
[1:21:27] turn he made you in air and he was
[1:21:29] bruised for your
[1:21:31] iniquity I say stop I stay stop being a
[1:21:35] slave to Satan and let him tell you that
[1:21:37] your past is causing you not to get this
[1:21:39] and not get that I heard brother B say
[1:21:42] and I may have quoted it to you and if I
[1:21:43] do it's worth quoting again I heard him
[1:21:45] say one time he said even if you did do
[1:21:48] something wrong that caused something to
[1:21:50] come on you because you did wrong he
[1:21:52] said you can pray and ask Lord Lord
[1:21:54] forgive me I'm sorry I didn't and let me
[1:21:57] get my healing and and just tell the
[1:21:59] Lord what you have need
[1:22:01] of do you realize that one of the things
[1:22:04] I think it was brother sheffy uh that
[1:22:06] lived in the 18th or 18th century when
[1:22:09] he lived they said one thing that was so
[1:22:11] odd about him is he talked to the Lord
[1:22:13] like he was right next to him that's the
[1:22:16] way we ought to talk to him if you have
[1:22:18] something you talk to him like he's
[1:22:19] right next to you because he is and he
[1:22:22] ain't just next to you but he's in you
[1:22:25] and tell him your problems tell him your
[1:22:28] failures Lord I'm sorry I need help
[1:22:31] brother said if your heart begins even
[1:22:32] to stray around he said get down and say
[1:22:35] Lord I can't quit this and quit that
[1:22:37] help me and restore me the joy of my
[1:22:42] salvation but he was bruised for our
[1:22:45] iniquity the chastisement of our peace
[1:22:49] was upon him and with his stripes we are
[1:22:53] healed
[1:22:55] man I'm a to every bit of that
[1:22:58] tonight I'm a to
[1:23:00] Healing I'm a to
[1:23:03] Salvation I have family that not really
[1:23:07] doing right I'm married of that
[1:23:09] too amen and I you know what I'm
[1:23:13] thankful for the presence of God even
[1:23:16] sometimes it's easy sometimes to to uh
[1:23:19] to pray you know people and and you pray
[1:23:22] and you say Lord help so and so and help
[1:23:24] this one and and I pray you'd bring so
[1:23:26] and so in and but then there's sometimes
[1:23:29] that I'm thankful and I know you
[1:23:31] probably had this happen I know many of
[1:23:33] you have but all of a sudden there's
[1:23:35] something more than just natural
[1:23:37] affection begins to move on the
[1:23:39] inside and here while back there's a
[1:23:42] family member of mine not doing
[1:23:44] right he's not he's not bad just not
[1:23:47] doing right and something began to start
[1:23:50] within my heart and I cried out to the
[1:23:52] Lord I said oh God
[1:23:54] I pray you do
[1:23:56] something man not just him but I've had
[1:23:59] other people come on my heart I have a
[1:24:01] right to it sister Joyce amen I have a
[1:24:04] right to it because I'm an heir to it I
[1:24:06] had a right the other night brother Joe
[1:24:09] as far as I know everything's I has been
[1:24:12] made right and I mean this but if you
[1:24:14] know something I ain't made right even
[1:24:15] the youngest boy or youngest girl here
[1:24:17] if you know something that you see me do
[1:24:19] and you don't think I made it right I
[1:24:21] want you to come to me the way you'd
[1:24:22] want me to come to you and be humble
[1:24:24] about it but you know what I want to be
[1:24:26] right so much I I would I would take not
[1:24:29] maybe correction that wouldn't be the
[1:24:31] right word but how old are you
[1:24:34] Connor
[1:24:35] nine if that boy come to me honest he
[1:24:38] said brother
[1:24:39] day I saw something and I I I didn't
[1:24:43] think it was right I'd won to be right
[1:24:45] sister Joyce I'd take it I'd say you
[1:24:47] know what son I was wrong if I wasn't
[1:24:49] wrong I wouldn't say I was but I I want
[1:24:51] to be that right brother Joe if you know
[1:24:52] I'm somewhere I ain't do right I want
[1:24:54] you to tell me I'm not doing right amen
[1:24:57] you pray for
[1:25:01] me and this thing's so real one of these
[1:25:04] days I'm convinced
[1:25:07] that one of these days that all that
[1:25:10] we're air
[1:25:12] to I don't know how to put it but maybe
[1:25:14] when it all comes to a head one day it's
[1:25:17] going to be a great thing brother Joel
[1:25:19] because I'm air I'm air to the
[1:25:23] millennium
[1:25:24] I'm mared can you imagine that one of
[1:25:26] these
[1:25:27] days when it becomes a reality when the
[1:25:30] Rapture takes place and I walk out you
[1:25:34] know I don't feel like I'm just Plum
[1:25:36] over the hill there's some days I may
[1:25:39] not feel like I did when I was
[1:25:41] 21 and I'm still I feel like maybe I'm
[1:25:45] not one of these young boys might say
[1:25:47] you're not but I feel like for an old
[1:25:49] guy I'm still a pretty good
[1:25:52] hos I don't know if I am or not I still
[1:25:55] have to work hard sometimes I know that
[1:25:56] and lift some stuff that I shouldn't
[1:25:58] probably be lifting
[1:26:00] on but I tell you when I walk out that
[1:26:02] day brother somewhere between 18 and 21
[1:26:06] I'm GNA be a Hos then amen I might be
[1:26:10] jumping that high I don't know what I'll
[1:26:12] do I'll be honest with I don't I thought
[1:26:13] about and I thought you know I might
[1:26:14] jump I don't know if I will or not when
[1:26:17] I'm in his presence and I see him and I
[1:26:20] see you sister Joyce and that black hair
[1:26:22] is Flowing down back when you he was
[1:26:24] young I don't mean that disrespectful
[1:26:26] but
[1:26:27] you our hair gets gray we start getting
[1:26:30] a few wrinkles but I'm going to tell you
[1:26:32] there'll come a time brother Tom amen
[1:26:35] it's going to be different then amen all
[1:26:38] the trials that you've went through all
[1:26:40] the troubles all the tests it's going to
[1:26:42] seem like they're nothing I don't even
[1:26:43] know what time it is but I got to I'm G
[1:26:46] to have to wrap it up I'm
[1:26:48] sorry but I'll try to wrap it up here in
[1:26:50] a few minutes I'm not going to give you
[1:26:52] a time frame but I'm not going to hold
[1:26:53] you long you know know I'm not
[1:26:54] long-winded but I I've I I enjoy
[1:26:57] speaking to you and I hope something's
[1:26:59] been an encouragement to cause you to
[1:27:01] look tonight to realize that you don't
[1:27:03] have to let Satan push you
[1:27:05] around maybe you ain't got all the
[1:27:07] answers you may said at the doctor this
[1:27:10] week and the doctor May say well I got
[1:27:13] bad news but that news is only what the
[1:27:16] doctor knows when he's done all he can
[1:27:17] do I want you to know that Jesus Christ
[1:27:20] ain't done all he can
[1:27:22] do right
[1:27:25] maybe when it looks like your job's in
[1:27:26] Jeopardy take it to him I'm kind of
[1:27:30] there right now my job's not in jeopardy
[1:27:31] but I don't know what to do in life and
[1:27:34] I just have to turn it over to him I
[1:27:37] I'll be honest you'd think that as old
[1:27:38] as I'm getting I'd be wise enough to I
[1:27:41] know what I want to do but I don't know
[1:27:42] what the Lord wants me to do yet so you
[1:27:44] pray for me but I know he'll work
[1:27:46] something out because he always does
[1:27:50] amen I don't know why I tell you the
[1:27:52] Bible says confess your faults one or
[1:27:53] the other but sometimes I'm the world's
[1:27:56] I I kind of inherited that my mom was
[1:27:59] kind of that way she was a good person
[1:28:01] but she worried about bridges that she
[1:28:03] hadn't crossed yet and sometimes it's
[1:28:06] easy to start worrying when you just
[1:28:08] have to stop and go they talking the
[1:28:10] other day just let go and let God Amen
[1:28:13] because he's going control
[1:28:15] anyway unless he's your co-pilot like I
[1:28:18] said switch seats let him be the
[1:28:20] pilot and I'm B about wanting to do it
[1:28:23] myself you know that's not the way to do
[1:28:26] it just learn to let go and let
[1:28:28] God man then he'll take you to whatever
[1:28:31] you have need
[1:28:32] of Amen I'm glad that we're are you glad
[1:28:35] that you're an heir
[1:28:37] tonight how many believes that you're an
[1:28:39] heir how many let me let me ask you this
[1:28:41] you don't have to raise your hand if you
[1:28:43] don't want to if you want to that's good
[1:28:45] how many of you believe you have the
[1:28:46] baptism of the Holy Ghost well I want
[1:28:49] you to know every one of you this is to
[1:28:52] you personal every one of you I can't
[1:28:54] call all of you
[1:28:56] names but every one of you are heir to
[1:29:00] everything that Jesus Christ left
[1:29:03] you me included I'm talking to me stop
[1:29:07] let Satan push you
[1:29:09] around
[1:29:11] amen and like I said I'm sometimes the
[1:29:13] world's worst so the preachers got
[1:29:16] problems
[1:29:18] too but stop let Satan push you
[1:29:21] around man stop letting him tell you it
[1:29:24] I don't know why that come back up it
[1:29:25] might not be for anybody but stop
[1:29:27] letting Satan tell you that your past

[1:37:40] change with her husband's work brother
[1:37:43] John she said usually I hope she don't
[1:37:46] care for me saying this but she told me
[1:37:48] she said usually I'm the one that's
[1:37:49] freaking out and get anxiety and stuff
[1:37:51] when stuff changes and she said but
[1:37:54] no doubt just the spirit of the Lord let
[1:37:56] it become real to her sitting here in
[1:37:57] church and told her that everything's
[1:38:00] going to be all right there'll be a
[1:38:02] change but I'm in control of it she said

[1:38:10] that she may not know at all but it's
[1:38:13] going to be all right man God is Mindful
