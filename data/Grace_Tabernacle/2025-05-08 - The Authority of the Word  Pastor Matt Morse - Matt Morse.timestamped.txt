[39:46] surrender ourselves knowing that we
[39:48] don't have any ability, Lord, and
[39:50] nothing that we could say or do that
[39:51] would help anybody, but God, may you
[39:53] come tonight, Lord, and let your word be
[39:55] alive among us. We pray in the name of
[39:57] Jesus Christ. We give you glory for all
[40:00] you do in Jesus name. Amen. Amen. You
[40:04] love the Lord tonight. Amen. How many
[40:06] say it's good to be in the house of the
[40:09] Lord. We just want to welcome you.
[40:11] Welcome all our vis visitors here

[40:18] you. Amen. If you come to hear me,
[40:20] you're in trouble. I don't have nothing
[40:21] to help you. But I know that this word
[40:23] does. Amen.
[40:25] There's there's a per you. It's the only
[40:27] place I know that you can come in sick
[40:28] and go out well. You can you can come in
[40:32] with an addiction and go out free from
[40:34] it, go out delivered. You can come in
[40:36] lost and go out saved. And uh there's a
[40:38] lot can happen in a few minutes in the
[40:40] presence of God. And so we certainly
[40:42] appreciate everyone for coming out. And
[40:45] just want to say uh the meeting was was
[40:48] a wonderful success and uh the tent
[40:51] meeting and so many of you was there.
[40:54] just really seen the hand of God in many
[40:56] situations and and lives and a lot of
[40:59] testimonies that come from it. And uh I
[41:01] had one lady that had kind of shared and
[41:04] the first couple of services she wasn't
[41:05] at the meeting but she was just watching
[41:08] on the stream and she had some sickness
[41:10] in her body and uh and uh some some
[41:13] pretty uh uh serious things and and so
[41:17] she was praying about it and watching
[41:18] the services and and uh and she said
[41:21] right in the middle of the service the
[41:22] Lord touched her body and healed her. So
[41:24] the next service she just packed
[41:25] everything up and came on up to the
[41:27] meeting and got in a revival one and
[41:29] brought she brought some Bibles and
[41:30] things from all of her children and and
[41:33] carried them all in there and said, "I
[41:34] come I'm going to claim my whole family
[41:35] if the Lord's able to do that for me
[41:37] sitting in my living room. What could he
[41:38] do with my family? So I come to stand on
[41:40] their behalf." And uh so we just saw the
[41:43] Lord uh really move and and appreciate
[41:46] all those brothers that that came and
[41:47] ministered. It really I fed a lot from
[41:50] it and got I just really enjoyed it. If
[41:52] y'all if y'all didn't have an
[41:53] opportunity to listen uh to Brother
[41:55] Andrew's message on Sunday morning, I
[41:59] would encourage you to do so. Any any
[42:01] believer ought to hear that message.
[42:03] Amen. And matter of fact, any any
[42:05] unbeliever ought to hear that message.
[42:07] And if there's any makeel believers,
[42:08] they ought to hear it, too. And and
[42:10] share it with your children and your mom
[42:11] and dad and all them. Make sure
[42:12] everybody uh everybody could hear it.
[42:15] And the last uh the last part of that
[42:17] just really uh I didn't watch it on the
[42:20] stream. I was there in person, but the
[42:22] Lord really moved and uh and in the the
[42:24] word that he was speaking, it was
[42:27] anointed of God and I really really uh
[42:29] it really meant a lot to me and you know
[42:32] I it it I know what it feels like to get
[42:34] out of your own self while you're
[42:36] listening to the the word coming forth
[42:38] and uh and that's that's what happened.
[42:40] The Lord just really moved and so
[42:42] certainly appreciate having our brothers
[42:44] there uh and people from the church
[42:47] there to support the meeting and heard
[42:49] the meetings here was just as well and
[42:52] had a great time in the Lord. Brother
[42:54] Joe brought the word of God and heard
[42:55] many reports from it. So certainly
[42:58] appreciate man of God that would hold
[43:01] down the fort. How many appreciates
[43:02] brother Joe and
[43:04] Amen. God bless
[43:07] you. Amen. We just love the Lord
[43:09] tonight. You love the Lord. Amen. How
[43:11] many loves his word? Amen. We just want
[43:16] to remember Sister Shakina. I forgot to
[43:18] say she just had the baby there and
[43:21] Rory's a couple year old
[43:24] twin little little girl. They sent a
[43:27] picture of some man she looks just like
[43:28] her big brother and but it was just just
[43:32] wonderful to see new life. Amen. So we
[43:35] just thank God for all that he's doing.
[43:37] You love the Lord, man. Won't you just
[43:38] reach around and welcome everyone in the
[43:40] house of the Lord tonight. And we're
[43:42] going to invite you to the Bible to the
[43:44] book of Joshua and we're going to read
[43:46] out of the first chapter tonight.
[43:49] first chapter and we'll turn to the
[43:51] first verse and uh just something about
[43:54] the presence of God. Amen. Amen. Joshua
[43:58] the first chapter. We'll read out the
[44:00] first verse and give you just a moment
[44:03] to turn there. Just when you get there,
[44:04] just say
[44:05] amen. We just want to remind everyone
[44:10] of the efforts that are being done on
[44:13] the church and it's just been a blessing
[44:15] so far. Everything's worked out really
[44:17] well and here in a few days we get to
[44:20] move forward on a on a little bit better
[44:22] project. We're all looking forward to so
[44:24] we're going to kind of bring that for
[44:25] the church here in a few days when we
[44:26] get everything worked out. So just to
[44:29] kind of ease everybody's minds. We're
[44:31] still working in that direction. So
[44:32] sometimes people ask but we want to uh
[44:35] take the word tonight and read out of
[44:37] Joshua the first chapter the first
[44:38] verse. And the Bible says, "Now after
[44:41] the death of Moses, the servant of the
[44:42] Lord, it came to pass that the Lord
[44:44] spake unto Joshua the son of Nun,
[44:46] saying, Moses minister, saying, Moses,
[44:50] my servant, is dead. Now therefore
[44:51] arise, go over this Jordan, thou and all
[44:54] this people under the land which I do
[44:55] give to them, even to the children of
[44:57] Israel, every place that the soul of
[45:00] your foot shall tread upon, that I have
[45:01] given unto you, as I said unto Moses,
[45:04] from the wilderness in this Lebanon,
[45:06] even unto the great river, the river
[45:08] Euphrates, all the land of the Hittites,
[45:10] and unto the great sea toward the going
[45:12] down of the sun, shall be your coast.
[45:14] And there shall not any man be able to
[45:17] stand before thee all the days of thy
[45:19] life. For as I was with Moses, so I will
[45:22] be with thee, and I will not fail thee,
[45:24] nor forsake thee. We'll just ask the
[45:27] Lord to add his blessing to the reading
[45:29] of the word tonight. If you want to take
[45:31] your seats and uh you know, we had
[45:33] started this um uh just a few uh weeks
[45:36] ago. we had first started in uh to
[45:39] speaking or reading out about the book
[45:40] of Joshua and and uh and we had started
[45:44] out in the stages of our journey showing
[45:46] how that they paralleled uh throughout
[45:48] the the span of Egypt and uh their
[45:51] wilderness journey on into the promised
[45:53] land and uh how it tied with the
[45:55] justification, sanctification, baptism
[45:56] of the Holy Ghost. And after that first
[45:59] uh service, we left right there at the
[46:00] border of Canaan uh and to pick up in
[46:03] the next service and uh where they had
[46:06] came to the end of their wilderness
[46:07] journey after being 40 years in the
[46:10] wilderness and they came to that place
[46:11] of about to cross over and uh and and
[46:14] brother Bram said, notice how when they
[46:16] came there that they before they could
[46:17] ever cross cross over into this uh
[46:20] promised land uh even though it belonged
[46:22] to them, even though it was promised to
[46:23] them by God, but remember Joshua had to
[46:26] call them to a place of sanctification
[46:28] in order to be able to receive it. So,
[46:30] uh, they couldn't just go in, but he
[46:31] said, "Sanctify yourselves and get
[46:33] ready, uh, because we're going to cross
[46:34] over into this land." And so, and then
[46:37] last Wednesday, we had picked this up,
[46:39] uh, in and and preached a message on
[46:41] pressing onward and showing, uh, we were
[46:43] speaking on Israel's battles and in the
[46:45] wilderness and how uh, that they fought
[46:48] uh, uh, battles to survive. They fought
[46:50] battles to they were fighting to eat,
[46:52] they were fighting to live, they were
[46:53] fighting to uh, uh, to gain position.
[46:56] you know, another day and another
[46:57] battle. It just seemed like everywhere
[46:59] they went kind of scattered around
[47:00] through the wilderness. But but they
[47:02] were always trying to to get to a better
[47:04] place and and make life a little bit
[47:06] better. And and we were showing how that
[47:08] that parallel to today and how that many
[47:11] people uh are fighting for something
[47:13] that isn't theirs. They spend their life
[47:14] fighting for uh fighting for a better
[47:17] life or fighting for a better home or a
[47:18] better way of living. All this
[47:20] inheritance that we're fighting for. And
[47:21] uh and many times we're just under
[47:23] attack of the devil. But uh but we
[47:25] realize that after Joshua took office
[47:28] that just four days later here they
[47:30] spent 40 years in the wilderness and
[47:32] within four days under the the the
[47:34] leadership of Joshua then they entered
[47:36] into this land of promise crossed over
[47:38] the Jordan uh to go into Jericho. And so
[47:41] uh we see that that God that what had
[47:43] God was doing there is what God done for
[47:45] us today. He said see he sent us a
[47:47] Joshua ministry and that ministry was
[47:50] not only to show you what was yours. It
[47:52] wasn't just to show you your inheritance
[47:53] or what land belonged to you, but that
[47:55] Joshua ministry, brother Mark, was sent
[47:57] to lead them people into an inheritance.
[48:00] So, it wasn't just to point to it or
[48:02] talk about it or show you where it might
[48:04] be or show it on a map, but Joshua
[48:06] actually led them into battle and he and
[48:08] he showed them how to possess it. I
[48:09] thought here he was a man that wasn't
[48:12] wasn't afraid of picking up a sword. He
[48:13] was a man that would that would carry it
[48:15] and go into battle. And so, tonight I
[48:17] want to carry this uh this on. And I
[48:19] would like to speak on the authority of
[48:21] the word. And um you know as I I was uh
[48:24] looking at this story of Joshua, I got
[48:26] to thinking about the man Joshua. And
[48:27] you know Joshua was a peculiar man.
[48:29] There was something that was different
[48:30] about him than uh many of the great men.
[48:33] And I don't I won't go through them all
[48:34] but you know I thought about the life of
[48:36] Jacob and how Jacob was with God. You
[48:38] realize Jacob was a man of reasoning. He
[48:40] always reasoned everything out. He
[48:41] wanted to know why this and why that and
[48:44] and he he wanted to see things. He he
[48:46] walked by sight a lot of times. But when
[48:47] it came to uh the man named Joshua,
[48:50] Joshua was a man, a man of great
[48:52] character. He was a man that he walked
[48:54] by faith. He wasn't looking for sight.
[48:56] He walked by the word of God. It was if
[48:58] God said it, it was good enough for
[48:59] Joshua. He may not been able to prove
[49:01] it, but he went anyway. Just that kind
[49:02] of a man. You ever notice sometimes when
[49:04] you see uh uh somebody that that that
[49:07] had this kind of uh resolve about him
[49:09] and and you know, when you read about
[49:11] Joshua early on in Israel, we don't hear
[49:13] nothing about Joshua. Matter of fact, I
[49:15] think in the in the Bible, by the time
[49:17] you hear about Joshua, I think he was
[49:18] about 40 years old before you uh read
[49:21] anything about his life. They had came
[49:22] out of Egypt. They went through this uh
[49:24] this great move. God had called them and
[49:27] and uh but but whenever we see him, we
[49:29] find out here he had come out of Egypt.
[49:31] We we find him in this place of uh when
[49:34] Moses had came to them and and he came
[49:36] down to Horeb and they had nothing to
[49:37] drink and they got thirsty and a drought
[49:39] had come on them and and and God had
[49:42] sent Moses to to strike the rock.
[49:44] remember. And then out of this rock or
[49:46] he struck the rock and God told him to
[49:47] speak to it and out of it would come
[49:48] this living water. And so it was at this
[49:51] time of this water that would come to
[49:53] the children of Israel. It would be a
[49:54] place of satisfaction, a place of of
[49:57] sustenium in this in this dry time. And
[50:00] uh which we realize was a type of
[50:01] Christ. Remember that's what the the uh
[50:03] Paul said. He said it was it was Christ
[50:05] in the wilderness. He was that rock.
[50:07] That's what Paul told the Corinthian.
[50:08] But but we notice that once they had
[50:10] this and they had the ability uh to have
[50:12] it, the first thing that happened after
[50:14] they had this water was the uh the
[50:17] Amalachites came down to take them uh to
[50:20] take it away or to bring a battle to
[50:21] him. And this is where we see Joshua his
[50:24] ministry or the or or where we see
[50:26] Joshua introduced in the Bible is Joshua
[50:28] was the man that was called of Moses to
[50:31] go fight this battle uh or this king
[50:33] Amalecch and them. And so, so, so I I
[50:36] thought it was something that here
[50:37] whenever they they had something, they
[50:39] finally had a little bit of something,
[50:40] they had this rock that would follow
[50:42] them through the wilderness. And I
[50:43] thought, isn't it something? It was just
[50:44] a type of the world that would come in
[50:46] and try to take what God had given them
[50:48] here. It may just been a little may just
[50:50] uh uh may seem like a little rock or
[50:52] something, but it was enough to feed
[50:53] millions of people or water uh them and
[50:56] all of their livestock out of it. But
[50:58] but when the enemy came to try to take
[51:00] it, but here Joshua raised up and and he
[51:03] took him over. And you know, you know,
[51:04] when you read I won't I won't go through
[51:06] them all, but when you read about the
[51:07] battles of Joshua, I found this to be
[51:09] something in common that when Joshua
[51:11] fought a battle, Joshua succeeded. In
[51:13] his first battle, it was successful. In
[51:16] his last battle, it was successful. The
[51:18] battles in between, it was successful.
[51:20] Joshua never lost one. Every battle that
[51:22] he faced, he was a man that just won the
[51:23] battle. I I thought it was something
[51:25] reading about him. He was a man that
[51:26] never knew defeat. And it was because he
[51:29] believed in God. He believed the word of
[51:32] the Lord. He believed the promise of
[51:33] God. He was a man of great faith. He
[51:35] was, if I could say it like this, Joshua
[51:38] was a man of great character. And he was
[51:40] relentless in his pursuit of the will of
[51:42] God. So once he knew what the will of
[51:44] God was, he wasn't a man uh that was
[51:46] willing to back down. He was he was a
[51:48] man that knew his position.
[51:50] But here he was a man of God. And we I
[51:53] love this story of Joshua's life when uh
[51:55] the Bible tells us we find Joshua one
[51:57] day as he's over by Jericho and he's
[52:00] getting ready to go into this place of
[52:01] the promised land and and the Bible I I
[52:04] love how it says because the Bible says
[52:05] while Joshua was there that all of a
[52:07] sudden a man appeared before him and he
[52:09] had a sword in his hand. Now most people
[52:12] that would have a man they were by
[52:13] theirel. Joshua didn't have a great army
[52:15] with him. He was a man by himself and
[52:17] here stood this great captain with a
[52:19] sword drawn. But you know what Joshua
[52:21] didn't do? He never fled. He never ran
[52:23] away. He never backed down. He never
[52:25] said, "Where's my backup?" The Bible
[52:27] says, "But Joshua went toward the man
[52:29] and he asked him, "Are you for us or are
[52:32] you against us?" I thought, "This is the
[52:33] kind of man that Joshua was." He wasn't
[52:35] fleeing from battle, but the Bible said
[52:37] he went to him and he said, "Are you of
[52:39] us? Are you of our adversary?" And the
[52:41] Bible said, "But the man spoke to him."
[52:43] He said, "No, but I am the captain of
[52:45] the host of the Lord." I thought my a
[52:46] man that was bold enough to stand before
[52:48] the captain of the host and say are you
[52:50] for me or are you against me? He was a
[52:52] man of great character. He was a man of
[52:55] great resolve and and but when he stood
[52:57] there the Bible said when he said I'm
[52:58] the captain of the host and that and
[53:00] from the Lord I now come the Bible said
[53:03] then Joshua fell on his face to the
[53:05] earth and he did worship him and he said
[53:08] unto him what saith my lord unto his
[53:10] servant and the captain of the Lord's
[53:12] host said to Joshua loose thy shoes from
[53:15] off thy feet for the place where thy
[53:17] stand is holy ground and Joshua did so I
[53:20] thought my what a character of the man
[53:23] named Joshua Joshua. You know what that
[53:24] tells me? It tells me that Joshua was
[53:27] man enough to stand his ground. He was
[53:29] man enough. He was enough of a man of
[53:31] God that he knew his position. He was
[53:33] man enough that he knew the promise of
[53:35] his inheritance. He was man enough to
[53:37] know that he had a right to stand before
[53:40] that place of Jericho. He had he was man
[53:42] enough to know that he had an authority
[53:44] to be there. He had an authority of the
[53:46] word of God to stand in that place. He
[53:48] was such of a man that when somebody
[53:50] would stand before him with their sword
[53:51] drawn that Joshua didn't run. But he
[53:53] went right down to where he was and
[53:55] said, "Who are you and what are you
[53:57] doing standing in my possession? Are you
[53:59] for me? Are you against me?" He was man
[54:01] enough to stand against any man. But let
[54:03] me tell you something about Joshua. He
[54:05] was also man enough to humble himself
[54:08] before the presence of God Almighty. I
[54:10] thought, what an example was a man named
[54:12] Joshua. He was man enough to stand upon
[54:15] the word. He was man enough to stand on
[54:17] the promise of God. He was man enough to
[54:19] stand on his God-given rise. But he was
[54:21] man enough to bow before the presence of
[54:24] God. He was man enough to worship God.
[54:26] He was man enough to surrender to the
[54:28] will of God. But Abraham said, "That's
[54:30] that's what kind of man we want to be."
[54:31] He said, "I I used to carry my Bible
[54:33] when I was a little boy and I love to
[54:35] carry it." And you know, until somebody
[54:37] told me one day, "You look like a
[54:38] preacher carrying your Bible." He said,
[54:40] "I didn't want to look like that. You
[54:42] know, I thought, well, my I'd look a lot
[54:43] you know, if I walk around and
[54:45] people think that about me." He said, "I
[54:47] thought a real man was somebody that was
[54:49] 6' tall and that weighed 190 pounds." He
[54:52] said, "But you know, I found out,
[54:53] friends, it takes a real man to carry a
[54:55] Bible." He said, "I wanted to be a real
[54:57] man." He said, "But you can't judge men
[55:00] by the size of his stature." Glory to
[55:02] God. Hallelujah. Let all the short
[55:04] people say, "Amen." You can't judge him.
[55:07] Hallelujah. Is there anybody? I'm the
[55:08] shortest man in here besides Brother
[55:10] Joe. And I say, "Amen." You can't judge
[55:12] a man by the size of his stature. He may
[55:14] look too short. He may be too tall. You
[55:16] might be too skinny. You might be too
[55:18] big. You might be too wide. You might be
[55:20] too narrow. But God don't judge a man by
[55:22] his stature. He said, "I've seen men
[55:24] that weigh 200 lb that didn't have an
[55:26] ounce of a man in him. But a man is
[55:28] judged by his character."
[55:31] He said, "And a real man will lose his
[55:32] own thoughts and his own thinking." He
[55:34] said, "And when you come up, you'll come
[55:35] up." I know what the devil says when you
[55:37] say he lose his own thoughts. And you
[55:39] know, you ever see a man that would lose
[55:40] his mind? he gets completely insane and
[55:43] they always start quoting scripture like
[55:44] they're spiritual or or some goofy
[55:46] thing. Said, "But when a man really gets
[55:48] in the presence of God, he don't come up
[55:50] out of his mind. He'll come up in his
[55:51] right mind. He'll come up with his right
[55:54] senses, but then Christ will take over
[55:56] him and express himself through him."
[55:58] And to the world, he may seem insane. He
[56:00] said, "But to him, but to God, it's a
[56:02] real man." See, it's our duty. It's our
[56:04] duty to repent. It's your duty to be
[56:06] baptized. It's our then it's God's duty
[56:08] or the God's duty to take you from there
[56:11] on and lead you from virtue unto
[56:13] knowledge unto temperance to patience to
[56:15] godliness to brotherly love and then the
[56:18] Holy Ghost heals you. He said then see
[56:21] you're a full stature of God a real man
[56:24] of God or a real woman of God anchored
[56:27] away in Jesus Christ. I don't know about
[56:29] you but I wonder how many would say that
[56:31] tonight that I want to be a real man or
[56:33] a real woman of God. That's the desire
[56:35] of our heart to be a real son or a real
[56:38] daughter of God. I say, Lord, let me
[56:40] stand tonight. Let me be man enough to
[56:42] be able to stand. Let me be man enough
[56:44] to be able to bow. Let me be man enough
[56:47] to speak, but man enough to be silent.
[56:49] Let me be man enough to walk, but man
[56:51] enough to be still. Let me be man enough
[56:53] to take action. But when God says hold,
[56:55] let me be man enough to hold. See, a
[56:58] real man or woman of God will be led of
[57:00] God. This is Joshua. I think this is
[57:03] such a paradox of a believer that a man,
[57:05] you ever thought about this, a man of
[57:07] God, the B Paul said Hebrews 4:16, he
[57:10] said, "Let us come boldly unto the
[57:12] throne of grace that we may obtain mercy
[57:14] and find grace in and the help in the
[57:17] time of need." Well, then when James uh
[57:19] 4:10, it says, "Humble yourselves in the
[57:22] sight of the Lord, and he shall lift you
[57:24] up." What a paradox it is to be a
[57:25] believer. One place says, "Go boldly
[57:27] before the throne of God." The other
[57:29] place says, "Humble yourself in the
[57:30] sight of God." God. See, there there's a
[57:32] great revelation of a believer that can
[57:34] be both bold and humble. See, because
[57:36] our boldness, it don't come from our own
[57:38] ability. I may as well preach. I'm here
[57:40] anyway. But our boldness don't come from
[57:42] arrogance. It don't come from from our
[57:44] from our raising. It don't come from how
[57:45] much money we got in the bank. It don't
[57:47] we don't approach God because we're
[57:48] somebody. So, our boldness, when the
[57:50] Bible says approach the throne of God
[57:52] with boldness, it it ain't our
[57:54] self-worthiness. It ain't our ability.
[57:56] It ain't how how many times I talked to
[57:58] the prophet. today how many times he
[58:00] blessed my family or or what kind of uh
[58:02] family that I came of our boldness to
[58:04] approach the throne of God. It ain't got
[58:06] nothing to do with all that because
[58:07] there ain't none of us worthy anyhow.
[58:09] But listen what Paul was really saying.
[58:11] He said seeing that we have a great high
[58:13] priest. May it makes me feel like
[58:15] preaching it that has passed into the
[58:17] heavens. It's Jesus the son of God. So
[58:19] let us hold fast our profession. For we
[58:22] have not a high priest that cannot be
[58:24] touched with a feeling of our
[58:26] infirmities, but was in all points
[58:28] tempted just like we are. Yet he was
[58:30] without sin. So you see, our boldness is
[58:33] not in the face of God. Our boldness is
[58:36] to go before the throne of God. Our
[58:38] boldness is in the face of the devil. So
[58:40] he said, "Approach the throne of God
[58:42] with boldness." That's to let the devil
[58:44] know that I have a right to approach the
[58:46] throne of God. I have a I have an
[58:48] intercessor. I I have an adversary that
[58:50] can be touched by the feeling of our our
[58:52] infirmities. So my boldness ain't to
[58:54] tell God. See, I got a right to be here.
[58:56] But my boldness is tell the devil, you
[58:58] can't stop me from going there. I've got
[59:00] a right. It was paid for by the blood of
[59:03] Jesus Christ. I can stand before the
[59:05] throne of God and he's interceded on my
[59:07] behalf. Oh, I think that's what we ought
[59:09] to do tonight is to tell the devil, I
[59:11] have a right to meet God at the throne
[59:13] of God. I've got a high priest that won
[59:16] the battle. I've got a God that cares
[59:18] about my feelings. And it's the God that
[59:20] you couldn't defeat. It's that Jesus
[59:23] that you couldn't defeat at Calvary. He
[59:25] beat you at Calvary. He beat you in
[59:27] hell. He beat you in the grave. He beat
[59:29] you in the tomb. Oh, hallelujah. The one
[59:31] you could not conquer.
[59:34] That conquered death, hell in the grave.
[59:36] That's where our boldness comes from.
[59:38] Because I have a God that I'm serving
[59:40] that has won every battle that he's ever
[59:42] faced against you. So therefore, I go
[59:44] boldly before the throne of God, but
[59:47] humbly at his feet I bow. Now, isn't it
[59:50] wonderful? Boldly and humbly we can
[59:52] approach God. Listen what God says to
[59:55] Joshua. The seventh verse, it says,
[59:57] "Only be thou strong and very courageous
[1:00:00] that thou mayest observe to do according
[1:00:03] to all the law which Moses my servant
[1:00:05] commanded thee. Turn not from it right
[1:00:08] hand to the left that thou may prosper
[1:00:10] wherever thou goest." What a what a
[1:00:12] word. Can you hear this tonight? This
[1:00:14] book of the law shall not depart out of
[1:00:16] thy mouth, but thou shalt meditate on it
[1:00:18] day and night, and there and that thou
[1:00:21] mayest observe to do according to all
[1:00:23] that is written therein. For then shalt
[1:00:26] thou make thy way prosperous, and then
[1:00:29] thou shalt have good success. So now
[1:00:31] we're seeing where Joshua's success
[1:00:33] comes from. Here God had given him when
[1:00:36] God would speak to him, he was telling
[1:00:37] him about the word that had been brought
[1:00:39] forth. And then he says, "Take this,
[1:00:41] meditate on it day and night. observe
[1:00:42] all that is written in it. I'll make
[1:00:44] your way prosperous. Then you'll have
[1:00:46] good success. See, because he would take
[1:00:48] the words of the law and all the Bible
[1:00:50] said all that was written therein.
[1:00:51] Somebody say all. All that was written
[1:00:54] therein and because he would obey it,
[1:00:56] brother Mark, it brought a blessing upon
[1:00:58] his life. Isn't that true? Watch the
[1:01:00] watch the blessing. He says the Bible
[1:01:01] says, "And thou shalt make thy way
[1:01:04] prosperous." How many knows what that
[1:01:05] means? It's a blessing. Thou shalt make
[1:01:08] thy way prosperous and then thou shalt
[1:01:10] have good success. But you realize this
[1:01:11] wasn't just for Joshua. But when Joshua
[1:01:14] speaks to the children of Israel, and he
[1:01:16] begins to tell them what God had
[1:01:17] commanded him. And he goes and instructs
[1:01:19] them on on how to to go forth into this
[1:01:22] battle. And after he would speak them,
[1:01:23] he he was telling them about their
[1:01:25] inheritance. And he would tell them
[1:01:27] where they would go and how they were
[1:01:28] going to receive and and how to how to
[1:01:30] how to handle the battle. And and then
[1:01:31] and then and then that God is going to
[1:01:34] is God is going to bless your family if
[1:01:36] you'll just follow the words of the
[1:01:37] book. And here Joshua lays it all out
[1:01:39] for them and says, "This is this is how
[1:01:41] we're going to obtain it. This is what
[1:01:42] God had given me instruction and and
[1:01:44] just follow what God says and and
[1:01:46] there's going to be a blessing that
[1:01:47] comes upon your household." And and I
[1:01:49] love what they say because in Joshua
[1:01:51] 1:16, it says, "And they answered Joshua
[1:01:54] saying, "All that thou hast commanded
[1:01:57] us, we will do, and wherever thou send
[1:02:00] us, we will go." I thought, "My, what an
[1:02:02] answer tonight." No wonder they
[1:02:04] prospered and no wonder they took the
[1:02:06] land that they were supposed to inherit.
[1:02:07] Brother Mark is because when they heard
[1:02:09] a word from the Lord, they said, "All
[1:02:11] that you say will do. Wherever you send
[1:02:13] me, I'll go." You say, "Well, why did
[1:02:15] they prosper?" Cuz they followed the
[1:02:16] words of the book. Why did they have
[1:02:18] success? Because they followed the words
[1:02:20] of the book. Why did they receive their
[1:02:22] inheritance? Because they follow the
[1:02:24] words of the book. And the Bible says
[1:02:25] that God brought the blessing of God
[1:02:27] upon their life. because they were
[1:02:29] willing to follow the word that God had
[1:02:31] sent unto them or or to them. I I
[1:02:33] thought my you you know many would look
[1:02:35] at this and say, "Well, you know, that's
[1:02:36] wonderful." But after all, that's just
[1:02:38] for Joshua and Israel. But but do you
[1:02:40] realize that we've been given the same
[1:02:41] order today? It wasn't just for Joshua.
[1:02:43] It wasn't just for them. And our order,
[1:02:45] it didn't come out of the Old Testament.
[1:02:47] It wasn't it wasn't keeping the Mosaic
[1:02:49] law. But you can find this in
[1:02:50] Revelations the first chapter in the
[1:02:52] third verse. The Bible said, "Blessed is
[1:02:54] he that readeth and they that hear the
[1:02:56] words of this prophecy and keep those
[1:02:59] things which are written therein."
[1:03:00] Here's our here here's our word to us.
[1:03:03] Brother Mark, you realize in this first
[1:03:04] chapter of Revelations that that what
[1:03:06] the what the Bible is showing this was
[1:03:08] the the the vision that John had. It was
[1:03:10] a revelation of who Jesus Christ was. So
[1:03:13] it was showing an authority who had
[1:03:16] authority over the church and how that
[1:03:18] Christ had been given authority over
[1:03:20] over death, over hell, over the grave,
[1:03:22] over heaven, over earth, over everything
[1:03:24] that was under the earth. It was showing
[1:03:25] the uh the supreme authority of Jesus
[1:03:28] Christ. In the first verse, it speaks
[1:03:30] for itself. It's speaking of a
[1:03:31] revelation of Jesus Christ. The second
[1:03:33] verse, it was St. John the Divine,
[1:03:35] showing who he was. He was a scribe and
[1:03:37] a servant. In the fourth through the
[1:03:38] sixth verse, it was a salutation to the
[1:03:41] church. In the seventh verse, it makes
[1:03:42] an announcement. In the eighth verse, he
[1:03:44] he declares the supreme deity of Jesus
[1:03:46] Christ. The ninth verse through the
[1:03:48] 20th, it's the entire Patmas vision or
[1:03:50] the or the Patmas vision as he begins to
[1:03:52] lay out. Also, in the 14th 15 verses, it
[1:03:55] describes the sevenfold glory of this of
[1:03:58] his person. And you know, brother B
[1:04:00] takes said, I I wish I could just preach
[1:04:02] a message on that. But but in the third
[1:04:04] verse, you'll notice in the third verse,
[1:04:06] it actually pronounces the blessing upon
[1:04:08] the church. And brother said, "Notice."
[1:04:10] He said, "It's in the consummation of
[1:04:12] the scriptures. The complete
[1:04:13] consummation, it's geographically placed
[1:04:16] at the right place at the end of the
[1:04:17] Bible. The revelation of the whole thing
[1:04:19] is placed right back here with a
[1:04:21] blessing to whoever reads it and who
[1:04:24] hears it and with a curse of any of them
[1:04:26] that would take away from it or add to
[1:04:27] it." So I thought, my you notice how the
[1:04:29] blessing comes. The Bible said, "He that
[1:04:32] readeth or or or they that hear, he that
[1:04:34] readeth, they that hear, there'll be a
[1:04:36] blessing upon them." I you know when you
[1:04:37] when you read this I I know that you
[1:04:39] could take that and read it and it would
[1:04:41] certainly that blessing would come upon
[1:04:42] you but whenever you actually read
[1:04:43] through the scripture you'll find out
[1:04:45] that this was a scripture or this this
[1:04:47] uh this revelation that John wrote was
[1:04:50] meant to be taken to the churches.
[1:04:51] Remember what God or Jesus told him. He
[1:04:53] said you take you take it to the seven
[1:04:54] churches in Asia. You deliver it to
[1:04:56] them. Make sure they they all get a
[1:04:58] copy. Make sure they make sure they hear
[1:04:59] what's here. Do you seal this part up?
[1:05:01] You keep this to the end. He gave him
[1:05:03] all the instruction on what was being uh
[1:05:05] what would be handed out and handed down
[1:05:07] into this age that we live in. So we
[1:05:09] realized that when he would give this to
[1:05:11] them, they would go that the that the
[1:05:13] minister of the church would take that
[1:05:14] was given and that they would go before
[1:05:16] the church and they would express it to
[1:05:18] the people. So they'd take that
[1:05:19] revelation. I thought, wonder what it
[1:05:21] was the first time that revelation was
[1:05:22] handed to somebody and they said, "The
[1:05:24] angel of the Lord said, read this to
[1:05:25] your church." I wonder when they got
[1:05:27] back there and went to reading it. Well,
[1:05:28] man, I never heard nothing like that. I
[1:05:30] I've never seen the sights of
[1:05:31] four-footed beasts and all these winged
[1:05:33] uh eagles and birds and caged birds and
[1:05:35] unclean and you know I never seen a
[1:05:36] sight of it but the angel of the Lord
[1:05:38] told us to read it before the church and
[1:05:40] and as they begin to read it listen what
[1:05:42] the Bible's telling them when you read
[1:05:43] it it's going to be read so blessed is
[1:05:45] he that readth and blessed are they that
[1:05:47] hear it so here when they were going to
[1:05:49] read it you know is actually speaking of
[1:05:51] an oracle in an assembly so here would
[1:05:54] come one that would read it to the
[1:05:55] assembly and the hearer would be those
[1:05:57] that would hear it so we realize It it
[1:05:59] was to be taken to them. It and and what
[1:06:01] this tells us, I I love this. I I I just
[1:06:04] think it's wonderful that it tells us
[1:06:06] that this revelation was not intended to
[1:06:08] be kept a secret. It wasn't intended to
[1:06:10] be kept in the mind of God, but it was
[1:06:12] intended to be preached. It was meant to
[1:06:14] be preached. It was meant to be heard.
[1:06:16] It was meant to be taken to every
[1:06:17] pullpit. It wasn't meant to be to remain
[1:06:20] a mystery. But there was coming a time
[1:06:21] that it would mean it would be meant to
[1:06:23] be revealed. And so, so it w it wasn't
[1:06:26] meant to be held back. So he says, "So
[1:06:27] you take it in even the the oracle and
[1:06:30] those that would hear it, they would
[1:06:32] they would receive a blessing from it."
[1:06:33] You know, I thought about this oracle of
[1:06:34] God. How many knows what an oracle is?
[1:06:36] The Bible says or or definition says the
[1:06:38] medium by which God reveals hidden
[1:06:40] knowledge or makes known a divine
[1:06:43] purpose. Isn't that what's taking place
[1:06:45] when you bring this revelation to the
[1:06:47] church? It's to reveal hidden knowledge
[1:06:48] or make known God's divine purpose. You
[1:06:50] know, when you when you look this word
[1:06:52] up in in in the Greek, the the word
[1:06:54] oracle, it has two meanings. It says the
[1:06:57] word of the Lord as it's found written
[1:06:59] in the law of Moses. And it's also a
[1:07:01] divine utterance of God. So the oracle,
[1:07:04] it's the word of the Lord as it's
[1:07:05] written or it's the it's the word of the
[1:07:07] Lord as it's being uttered. In the
[1:07:10] Hebrew language in 2 Samuel, you can
[1:07:12] read about it. Again, remember when the
[1:07:13] Bible would tell us they were searching
[1:07:15] for a word from God. The Bible says it
[1:07:17] was as if a man had inquired at the
[1:07:19] oracle of God. Here's that that that
[1:07:21] word was uh the Hebrew word debar which
[1:07:24] actually meant the spoken word of God.
[1:07:26] So it don't matter if you're reading out
[1:07:27] of the old testament or you're reading
[1:07:28] out of the new or new testament you find
[1:07:30] the same thing whether it's in Hebrew
[1:07:32] whether it's in Greek or whether it's in
[1:07:34] English it's a divine word of God being
[1:07:37] spoken or uttered. It's a divine word of
[1:07:39] God that's been spoken or uttered. I
[1:07:41] thought my isn't it something that God
[1:07:42] would call us to receive from an oracle
[1:07:45] of God because that's what God told us
[1:07:46] in the beginning. Remember, there's a
[1:07:48] power that comes behind a word of God
[1:07:51] that is spoken or uttered. Isaiah talked
[1:07:53] about it in Isaiah 55. He said, "Every
[1:07:55] word that God has ever uttered, the
[1:07:57] words that would that would that would
[1:07:59] come out of my mouth that would go forth
[1:08:00] out of my mouth, it will not return to
[1:08:02] me void, but it would do two things.
[1:08:04] One, it would accomplish what God
[1:08:06] intended for it to accomplish. And two,
[1:08:09] it would prosper in the thing that God
[1:08:10] sent it to." So that means when they
[1:08:12] would come to a pull pit and they would
[1:08:14] take this revelation of God and they
[1:08:16] would utter it before the people, it
[1:08:18] would do two things. It would accomplish
[1:08:19] the very thing God intended for it. That
[1:08:22] revelation, it would find the resting
[1:08:23] place. Every believer, they would say,
[1:08:25] "Amen." The unbeliever, they'd run out
[1:08:27] screaming, but it but it found its place
[1:08:29] and it brought back to God the very
[1:08:31] thing that God had intended for it. The
[1:08:33] divine purpose of God was done and it
[1:08:35] prospered in every believer. It
[1:08:38] prospered them. Think about it. Because
[1:08:39] they heard the word of the Lord. That's
[1:08:41] our that's our our blessing. The word of
[1:08:43] God. You let me tell you what the truth
[1:08:45] this this evening that the word of God
[1:08:47] will prosper. Here's what the Bible's
[1:08:48] telling us. It'll prosper in both the
[1:08:50] speaker and the hearer. Isn't that
[1:08:52] wonderful? You can't do nothing. You you
[1:08:54] speak about the things of God. And you
[1:08:56] allow God to use you to speak, you
[1:08:58] you'll receive a blessing for it. You
[1:09:00] you go testify to somebody, you're going
[1:09:02] to be blessed for testifying. But just
[1:09:04] hearing the word of testimony is a
[1:09:06] blessing to you. Hearing the preaching
[1:09:08] of the word is a blessing to you. says,
[1:09:10] "See, so whether you're speaking or
[1:09:11] hearing, it's a blessing of God." But
[1:09:14] let me tell you this, God is not just
[1:09:16] looking for an oracle that would repeat
[1:09:18] the word because this is where many
[1:09:19] people have gotten to. Well, I I can
[1:09:21] take the word and I I can repeat it. I
[1:09:23] can say it just like that. I can train
[1:09:25] up and and maybe read it or recite it in
[1:09:27] just the right way. And and y'all know I
[1:09:30] can't do that, but I get so so messed up
[1:09:32] and tongue tied sometimes. But but but
[1:09:34] that ain't what God's looking for. He's
[1:09:35] not looking for a parrot. Hello,
[1:09:37] somebody. God ain't looking for church
[1:09:39] parents that can recite scripture and go
[1:09:41] out and recite uh uh something about it,
[1:09:44] you know, and everything that happen in
[1:09:45] their life, just quote a scripture or
[1:09:47] put a a post on their on their Facebook
[1:09:49] page or something that that that that
[1:09:51] makes them a a believer or something
[1:09:52] like that. God ain't looking for church
[1:09:54] parents. He's looking for believers.
[1:09:56] He's looking He's not looking for just
[1:09:57] an oracle that can speak a word, that
[1:10:00] can repeat a word. But God is looking
[1:10:02] for an oracle that can manifest a word.
[1:10:05] Hello. There's some big difference
[1:10:06] between one that can speak a word and
[1:10:08] one that can manifest a word. You say,
[1:10:10] "Well, brother Matt, how is it?" Can I
[1:10:11] read it to you? Hebrews the 9th chapter,
[1:10:14] Paul said, "We are serving the living
[1:10:16] God with living oracles." Now, let me
[1:10:19] ask you this. What is a living oracle?
[1:10:21] It's not just a word that's recited. He
[1:10:23] said, "See, now notice Paul, he's not
[1:10:25] just saying like they go up like a
[1:10:27] Hebrew used to and and take his
[1:10:29] sacrifice. There was so many people that
[1:10:31] could follow the word like that. So many
[1:10:33] that could repeat it like that. Back
[1:10:35] then, they would take the sacrifice
[1:10:36] because the word said do it. So they'd
[1:10:38] go through the motion. They'd take a
[1:10:39] sacrifice. They'd come down the road,
[1:10:41] have a big a bulock, lay his hands upon
[1:10:43] it, and identify himself and and the and
[1:10:45] the shed blood. They go back justified
[1:10:47] because the word said they would. But
[1:10:49] Jehovah required it and they did it. But
[1:10:51] then what's happened? Brother said the
[1:10:52] next generation maybe they got a little
[1:10:54] colder and then somebody else they got a
[1:10:56] little colder. Generation
[1:11:09] tradition. He said that's what Pentecost
[1:11:11] has become to us. It's a family
[1:11:13] tradition. We get down and say, "Well,
[1:11:15] wasn't that television show pretty good
[1:11:28] tonight? that. He said, "Oh yeah, it's a
[1:11:31] family tradition." Well, you know what
[1:11:32] God said? He said, "Your fats and your
[1:11:34] rams, they stink in my nostrils." He
[1:11:37] said, "That's right. Their sacrifices
[1:11:39] has became a stink in the nostrils of
[1:11:41] God." He said, "And that's the way it
[1:11:42] was with Pentecostal sacrifices." And
[1:11:45] all of our denominational cutups and
[1:11:47] carry on are women and men doing the way
[1:11:50] they do. It's a form of godliness. They
[1:11:52] work up music, get somebody to jump up
[1:11:54] and down a little while, and then it's
[1:11:55] all over like a bucket of water's been
[1:11:57] thrown on it. But if the word of God
[1:11:59] happened to come forth and say
[1:12:00] something, he said, "What's the matter?
[1:12:02] Your sacrifices have become a stink
[1:12:04] before Jehovah." He said, "But it was at
[1:12:06] that time whenever it had got so cold.
[1:12:09] It was at that time when it had got so
[1:12:11] formal when it was just a tradition and
[1:12:13] every oracle of God or every man that
[1:12:16] was standing a pullpit was just speaking
[1:12:18] words and reciting words and quote my
[1:12:20] will get myself in trouble. Don't don't
[1:12:21] get me kicked out of the circle." But
[1:12:23] but they became the best plagiarizers in
[1:12:25] the world. long as I can read a quote.
[1:12:27] As long I can read a scripture and I can
[1:12:29] make it sound good, then it must be God.
[1:12:31] But God ain't looking for somebody just
[1:12:33] to recite a word. God's looking for
[1:12:35] somebody that will manifest his word and
[1:12:37] be a living reality of Jesus Christ
[1:12:41] today. He said they become sacrifices.
[1:12:44] He said it was at that time when it
[1:12:46] became cold. It was at that time that
[1:12:48] Isaiah the prophet come on the scene and
[1:12:51] he told them, "But I'll give you an
[1:12:53] everlasting sign. a virgin shall
[1:12:55] conceive. He said, "There you are. No
[1:12:57] more no longer is it dead forms and
[1:13:00] creeds, but it became living oracles, a
[1:13:03] living God that's raised from the dead
[1:13:05] that is living among us today." Oh,
[1:13:07] don't you see, friends? That's what God
[1:13:09] is looking for today. He's looking for a
[1:13:11] word that is alive. He's looking for a
[1:13:13] church that is alive. He's looking for
[1:13:15] the word that's living amongst his
[1:13:17] children, that's living in people and
[1:13:19] manifesting through them.
[1:13:21] He said, "If the church could only get a
[1:13:23] fresh revelation and become by it the
[1:13:26] living word manifested, we would do the
[1:13:28] greater works and glorify God our father
[1:13:32] which is in heaven. Amen. It ain't about
[1:13:34] what we can recite or repeat or quote.
[1:13:36] It's the life that we can live." Now,
[1:13:39] ain't that powerful? Can I read that
[1:13:41] again? If the church could only get a
[1:13:43] fresh revelation and become by that
[1:13:46] revelation a the living word manifested,
[1:13:50] we would do the greater works and
[1:13:52] glorify our God which is in heaven. You
[1:13:55] want to bring glory to God, manifest the
[1:13:57] word of God in your life. You want to
[1:14:00] bring glory to God, manifest a living
[1:14:02] reality of Jesus Christ. Listen what the
[1:14:05] Bible says. Revelations 1 and3. and keep
[1:14:09] those things which are written therein.
[1:14:13] It was to hear it or or to speak it to
[1:14:16] hear it and then keep those things which
[1:14:19] are written therein for the time is at
[1:14:21] hand. I thought my isn't that a a
[1:14:22] wonderful word tonight. Isn't that what
[1:14:24] Joshua said? Keep the word. Don't don't
[1:14:27] stray from it in any way if you want to
[1:14:29] see this blessing come upon your life. I
[1:14:31] thought many felt today said you got to
[1:14:33] have faith in what you're doing if and
[1:14:35] your if your heart condemns us not. He
[1:14:37] said, "We we know the Bible teaches us
[1:14:39] something. If we fail to do that, then
[1:14:40] there then we can't have faith." See, so
[1:14:43] you can't get yourself together because
[1:14:45] you know there's certain things that God
[1:14:46] teaches that you won't cope with. So
[1:14:48] when you do that, then where are you at?
[1:14:49] I know this ain't the most popular
[1:14:51] stuff, but I'm going to say it anyway.
[1:14:52] He said, "See, you can't have faith on
[1:14:55] what you're coming to. You can't come up
[1:14:57] there and say, "Last night I was drunk,
[1:14:58] but Lord, I want you to heal me this
[1:15:00] morning, and if you'll heal me, then I
[1:15:01] won't drink too much anymore." He said,
[1:15:03] "That don't ever work. You've got to
[1:15:05] surrender yourself and give yourself
[1:15:07] completely to God and obey every bit of
[1:15:10] the word. Sell out completely and then
[1:15:12] take the word. That word that is in the
[1:15:14] church. It is a living word. Sell out
[1:15:17] completely to God. Pour out the things
[1:15:19] of the flesh. Pour out the things of the
[1:15:21] world and take the word of God and let
[1:15:23] it be a living reality in your heart.
[1:15:25] Let me tell you why people struggle be
[1:15:27] Christians and they struggle to serve
[1:15:28] God because they won't pour everything
[1:15:30] out. They come down to an altar. They
[1:15:32] they pray. They repent. They go through
[1:15:34] justification, sanctification, brother
[1:15:36] Mark, but they just won't pour
[1:15:37] everything out. But I thought, oh God,
[1:15:39] if we could come tonight under the
[1:15:41] commission of the word of God and say,
[1:15:43] Lord, let me pour everything out of my
[1:15:45] heart that there ain't but one thing
[1:15:46] that remains. It's a desire to be a
[1:15:48] living oracle of God and let the word of
[1:15:51] God be manifested out of my life. That
[1:15:53] ought to be the desire of every believer
[1:15:55] tonight. Let me ask you, you know what
[1:15:57] keeps the the word from having authority
[1:16:00] today? This is what the this is the this
[1:16:01] is why the church is weak. This is why
[1:16:03] many many are are sick. Many are weak.
[1:16:05] Many many don't have the authority of
[1:16:08] the word of God. But the problem is is
[1:16:10] because too many people put that word in
[1:16:12] history.
[1:16:14] So why don't the why don't the word have
[1:16:16] its authority is because the only
[1:16:17] authority you give it is what God used
[1:16:19] to do. The only authority you give is
[1:16:21] what God done with this other man or
[1:16:23] this other this you know he was a great
[1:16:24] man. He lived in a great time. He it's
[1:16:26] always about somebody. But but listen,
[1:16:28] it wasn't to be about that. That brother
[1:16:29] B said, he said, "No believer will ever
[1:16:32] place God's word somewhere in the past.
[1:16:35] He'll never make God a weakling." Hello,
[1:16:37] somebody. There ain't no believer
[1:16:39] that'll ever make God a weakling. He'll
[1:16:42] never make God a God, a historical God.
[1:16:44] He said he is a a historical God. But
[1:16:47] he's the same yesterday, today, and
[1:16:50] forever. Therefore, just as much as he
[1:16:52] was in history, he's the same God today.
[1:16:55] All that he used to be, he's the same
[1:16:57] God today. and he cannot lose his power.
[1:17:00] You know what that tells me? If God ever
[1:17:02] was a healer, then God's still a healer.
[1:17:04] If you can read about God delivering
[1:17:06] somebody out of a fiery furnace, then
[1:17:08] God can still deliver out of a fiery
[1:17:10] furnace. You want to read about God that
[1:17:12] would change a life, then God can still
[1:17:14] change a life. You want to hear about
[1:17:15] God saving a soul, then God can save
[1:17:18] about save a soul. Anything that God has
[1:17:20] ever done, God can still do today. He's
[1:17:23] still the same God. He's the same
[1:17:25] yesterday, today, and forever. He's the
[1:17:28] same God. If he ever healed, he still
[1:17:30] heals. If he ever saved, he still saves.
[1:17:32] Somebody say, "Amen." If he ever changed
[1:17:34] a heart, he can still change a heart. If
[1:17:36] he ever restored a family, he can still
[1:17:38] restore our family. If he ever fed
[1:17:40] 5,000, he can feed his hungry children
[1:17:42] today.
[1:17:45] He can forgive our sins filled with the
[1:17:48] Holy Ghost. He said, "But where the
[1:17:49] weakness is that fell in our churches in
[1:17:51] the beginning, in the early apostolic
[1:17:53] church, what did we do? We started
[1:17:55] taking that church and breaking it up
[1:17:57] the fellowship and making different
[1:17:59] sectarian people and organizations till
[1:18:01] we've got it down to a big chaos of
[1:18:03] nothing. But we need to get back to the
[1:18:05] word, back to God, back to a living
[1:18:09] word. Look what we're looking to,
[1:18:10] brother Mark. An authority of the word
[1:18:12] of God in a believer's life. Back to an
[1:18:15] authority of God's word. I thought, my
[1:18:17] what an authority they had when they
[1:18:19] walked around Jericho. Do you realize
[1:18:21] they would they wouldn't walk around
[1:18:22] there doubting and wondering? You know
[1:18:24] why? Because they were following, man, I
[1:18:25] could preach on this. They were
[1:18:27] following Joshua. And every battle that
[1:18:29] Joshua had ever fought, Joshua always
[1:18:32] won. If they went into a battle, well,
[1:18:34] who's leading the battle? It's Joshua up
[1:18:36] there in the front. Praise God. We're
[1:18:37] about to win this one. Somebody give me
[1:18:38] a sword or a boot or something. I don't
[1:18:39] care what. We're going to win the battle
[1:18:41] cuz Joshua ain't never lost the battle.
[1:18:44] They were following Joshua around
[1:18:45] Jericho. They didn't wonder what was
[1:18:46] going to take place because they was
[1:18:48] following Joshua. They didn't wonder if
[1:18:49] the walls were really going to fall
[1:18:50] down. They were following Joshua. his
[1:18:52] track record. He was 100 and0. Can I put
[1:18:55] it like that? He was 100 and0. 100 win
[1:18:57] and zero loss. He had never been
[1:18:59] defeated.
[1:19:01] He was a man of war. And because he was
[1:19:04] commissioned, they they walked around
[1:19:07] these walls. And I thought, my what an
[1:19:09] authority they had when they went
[1:19:10] through Jericho and they went into that
[1:19:12] land driving out their inhabitants. They
[1:19:14] said, "You ain't got a right in my
[1:19:15] land." Well, I've been living in this
[1:19:17] land for four. Isn't that just like the
[1:19:18] devil? Satan, you ain't got no right in
[1:19:20] my life. I I got an authority of the
[1:19:22] word of God. And Satan comes right back
[1:19:24] says, "I've lived in this life for 40
[1:19:26] years. I I've lived here for 43 for
[1:19:28] generations. My family has possessed
[1:19:30] this and I ain't going nowhere." But
[1:19:32] something on the inside of them said,
[1:19:34] "But I'm under the authority of the
[1:19:36] commission of Joshua and you have no
[1:19:38] right here any longer." And they could
[1:19:39] drive them out. What give them the
[1:19:41] authority to drive out the inhabitants?
[1:19:43] Don't you realize that the bride of
[1:19:45] Jesus Christ today has that same
[1:19:47] commissioned authority? Oh, why? You
[1:19:49] think about why why many why many speak
[1:19:51] and it don't come to pass. Why? Why do
[1:19:53] they why do they make claims but they're
[1:19:55] not able to possess it? Brother Joe,
[1:19:57] it's because they don't have a
[1:19:58] scriptural authority. They don't know
[1:19:59] where they stand. They they never been
[1:20:01] told that that that there's an authority
[1:20:03] in the word of God. So notice what God
[1:20:04] notice what God does. But the Bible
[1:20:06] says, see, without scriptural authority,
[1:20:08] they'll they'll try to take it by creed,
[1:20:10] but they never can take it. I'm going to
[1:20:11] recite the creed and bl glory to God.
[1:20:13] I'm going to whoop every devil in my
[1:20:14] life. I'm going to lose the desire of
[1:20:16] sin. I'll never want to smoke no more. I
[1:20:18] never want to drink. I all that stuff's
[1:20:19] gone out of my life. I'll never, you
[1:20:21] know, because I I I recited this creed
[1:20:22] and now all those desires are gone. But
[1:20:24] they'll never do it by creed. I run out
[1:20:26] of time. They'll never do it by creed.
[1:20:28] Said, you know what? Then they'll try
[1:20:29] then they'll try to do it by sensations.
[1:20:31] They'll they'll try to drive it out by
[1:20:33] sensation. Man, I feel it now. Oh my I
[1:20:35] got I feel goosebumps all over my body.
[1:20:37] Oh, the devil must be leaving. That'll
[1:20:38] never cause the devil to leave you. An
[1:20:41] air conditioner can give you goosebumps.
[1:20:43] Hello. I don't mean to mess up on
[1:20:45] people's spirituality. if that's what
[1:20:46] you were using to think you was filled
[1:20:48] with the Holy Ghost. God help you.
[1:20:52] But that he said, "You can't do it by
[1:20:54] sensation." He said, "I've seen you say,
[1:20:56] "Well, I spoke in tongues all night
[1:20:57] long." Well, that's good. I've seen the
[1:20:59] devil do the same thing. So, it couldn't
[1:21:01] be that. That ain't what gave them the
[1:21:04] authority. Said, "But in the days of
[1:21:05] Joshua, think about the only way they
[1:21:07] would ever have their inheritance would
[1:21:09] be by the authority given under that
[1:21:11] Joshua commission."
[1:21:14] You know, Joshua is being a type of the
[1:21:16] Holy Ghost. And see, that's the only
[1:21:18] authority they had was what was under
[1:21:19] Joshua's commission. They didn't go
[1:21:20] outside of what Joshua said. They didn't
[1:21:23] come in there and say, "Well, you know,
[1:21:24] I I like I see, you know, I know what
[1:21:26] Joshua said." But, you know, wouldn't it
[1:21:28] be easier if we went around this way?
[1:21:29] They didn't they didn't do it. They just
[1:21:30] followed the commission of Joshua. And
[1:21:32] you know what, friends? Today, it's the
[1:21:33] exact same thing. We've been reading
[1:21:35] through this scripture for three weeks
[1:21:37] and and and showing how that God used us
[1:21:39] and tapped us with this church. And
[1:21:41] today, it's the same. Do you realize
[1:21:42] that you won't ever have your
[1:21:43] inheritance by a church? You'll never
[1:21:45] have your inheritance following a
[1:21:47] denomination. You'll never have your
[1:21:48] inheritance following an organization or
[1:21:50] putting your putting your faith in men
[1:21:52] or putting your faith in some church or
[1:21:53] something like that. Said that that
[1:21:55] that'll never give it to you. But the
[1:21:56] only authority that you have over the
[1:21:58] devil is by the message of the hour that
[1:22:00] came under a modern-day Joshua
[1:22:02] commission. That's where your authority
[1:22:04] comes from. You want to take the devil,
[1:22:06] I'm just going to preach. I know the
[1:22:07] devil don't like it, but you let me tell
[1:22:08] you how to get rid of the devil under
[1:22:10] out of your life is to fall under the
[1:22:12] authority of that Joshua commission that
[1:22:14] came that's never lost the battle. It's
[1:22:16] the authority of the Holy Ghost that
[1:22:18] came in this age. That's why when Jesus
[1:22:20] said in my name, they shall cast out
[1:22:22] devils. Don't you realize that through
[1:22:24] the course of time, devils had more
[1:22:26] power than the church had. They they
[1:22:28] they consumed lies. They got they got
[1:22:30] into people. They couldn't get them out
[1:22:32] no more. They couldn't make people well.
[1:22:34] They could pray for the sick. The sick
[1:22:35] never got better. They they done all
[1:22:37] that they could, but the devil never
[1:22:38] left. He found him a good resting place
[1:22:41] because through the course of time, they
[1:22:43] had given up on that authority. You know
[1:22:46] what they did? They wandered around in
[1:22:47] the wilderness. It was stripped of them.
[1:22:49] I I don't have time to go through Roman
[1:22:50] Catholicism, but they they stripped it
[1:22:52] of them. And the and the and the the
[1:22:54] Christian believers, they made it they
[1:22:55] made an agreement with Rome and said,
[1:22:57] "Well, that'll work. You you'll give us
[1:22:58] a little bit. We'll give a little bit
[1:22:59] there. We'll all get baptized in in the
[1:23:01] name, Father, Son, Holy Ghost. will be
[1:23:03] good Catholics and and we won't we
[1:23:05] promise we won't baptize the name of the
[1:23:06] Lord Jesus Christ no more like like
[1:23:08] Jesus told us to and like Peter and all
[1:23:10] those apostles and all those disciples
[1:23:12] said we won't do that no more we'll do
[1:23:13] it how the Catholic bishop wants us to
[1:23:15] do it and we'll all come together 3:25
[1:23:17] AD the first time anybody was ever
[1:23:19] baptized in the name of the father son
[1:23:21] and the holy ghost came from the Roman
[1:23:22] Catholic church in the second century
[1:23:24] they were taking Jesus out of the church
[1:23:26] taking the the authority of that living
[1:23:28] oracle of god out of the church in other
[1:23:31] words they were taking away the the
[1:23:33] recipe or or the way that God would fill
[1:23:36] a believer. If they if the devil could
[1:23:37] take that away, then he had a powerless
[1:23:39] bunch of people. No wonder he could rule
[1:23:41] over them. They were all powerless
[1:23:42] because they ain't none of them had the
[1:23:43] Holy Ghost. You say, "Well, how you know
[1:23:45] they didn't have the Holy Ghost?" Well,
[1:23:46] they went out and they baptized in
[1:23:47] titles and accepted a creed over the
[1:23:49] word of God. Therefore, they could they
[1:23:51] didn't even have the right order to be
[1:23:52] able to receive the Holy Ghost. No
[1:23:54] wonder Satan ruled over them. So, but
[1:23:57] there was a few believers, but Martha
[1:23:59] stood. They deemed them as heretics.
[1:24:00] They took their lives by the hundreds
[1:24:02] and thousands and killed them because
[1:24:04] they stood upon this message that you
[1:24:06] stand on today. So, see, but they said
[1:24:09] they through the course of time they
[1:24:10] gave up their authority here. They
[1:24:12] wandered in the wilderness. They went
[1:24:14] from one belief to another, one church
[1:24:15] to another. I got a a few minutes, maybe
[1:24:18] 10 minutes. One church to another. We've
[1:24:21] seen it start Roman Catholicism 325 AD.
[1:24:24] But notice it didn't just stay there.
[1:24:26] Whenever all of a sudden a few years
[1:24:28] later after all that great that that
[1:24:30] great loss and the dark ages 1517 the
[1:24:33] reformation period started with Martin
[1:24:34] Luther in 1530 they started the Lutheran
[1:24:37] church. Watch as this begins to evolve.
[1:24:40] 1537 men of Simmons started the or
[1:24:43] Simons started the Menite church in the
[1:24:45] church of Scotland 1560. Presbyterians
[1:24:48] by John Knox in 1560. the Episcopal
[1:24:50] Church in the United States in 1607. By
[1:24:53] 1609, here's John Smith, he started the
[1:24:55] Baptist Church. 1648, George Fox started
[1:24:59] uh the Quaker church or the the Society
[1:25:01] of Friends that they called it. The
[1:25:02] Amish church 1693, Jacob Almond started
[1:25:05] the Amish church. Methodist church, it
[1:25:07] was started by John and Wesley or
[1:25:09] Methodism in 1738 and eventually became
[1:25:11] the Methodist church. In 1800s, they
[1:25:13] they started what was called the
[1:25:15] Holiness Church. Then the then the
[1:25:16] Adventist
