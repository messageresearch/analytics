the Lord amen just come to receive something from the Lord amen just a just a real pleasure to be able to have a God that we can turn to in the time of need and he never fails us and he's always he's always here and and just speak into our hearts so we're just thankful that to be able to be here this morning we just like to say happy Mother's Day to all of our lovely mothers may God bless you this morning we won't we just give our our mamas a round of applause and and it's a certainly a a special time and and I think every day ought to be Mother's Day amen so we just uh just want to take a moment the day so just a as a special time to remember them and I want to share a testimony with you before before we uh take the prayer request and um we had over about um uh I guess March of last year my mom was in the hospital and uh she was she was on her deathbed actually and they didn't have no way to uh I didn't mean to stop y'all I'm sorry sis um but they didn't have no way to uh uh to get her back to health they she needed a heart operation and wasn't able to operate on her she's had I believe she's on her eighth pacemaker since she was 17 years old she got her first Pacemaker and I don't know in the world how many people that's ever had eight pacemakers um it you know some of them say it's a record I don't know if they keep a record of it but that's a lot of times to have that surgery and so she's been through many heart surgeries open heart surgeries and and uh it's always been a part of our life I I took a pacemaker to uh to kindergarten for show and tail it's just always it's always been a part of us you know and and I remember when whenever she got one changed and recharged and we got our mama back and one one day she wasn't able to talk to us the next day she was running in the yard playing with us and so that's always we always remember you know remember that growing up but it got to this place last March and and uh and they had no way to to do anything with her and I remember going in the hospital and different ones that came by and she wasn't even able to get out of the bed or talk or or eat she hadn't ate nothing in days and I can't explain the what she looked like but it was just uh she couldn't even couldn't stand up and and we we thought at the moment that that something didn't change that it just be a few more days that she would be with us and uh we had prayer with her and different ones is praying for and and uh we just um saw the that next day we had got up and and and helped her get up and take a step in the in which was a big thing just to take one step and I asked her if she wanted to walk to the door that day and she said well you know she could barely whisper enough to you know kind of let you know she would and so it kind of scuffled to the door and she wanted to go a little bit down the hall and she kind of scuffled a little down the hall and then they had to bring her back but we already seen in one day that the Lord had you know given her a little bit of strength and and uh the doctors wouldn't wouldn't give her the surgery cuz it would kill her and they just said she'll never be able to survive it and so they had Specialists from other states trying to make it where they would do it and and so we worked on our strength to be able to have a operation to get the valve and stuff replac placed again and and uh so they finally went through with that and still the recovery has been a long time and so we kind of made a goal with her as a family to to make uh uh 10,000 steps in a day uh and so we kind of put a a a Target out there and and a reward for her and tried to get her to work on it since that time and and uh this week we went our family went with went with my mom and and uh went to took the kids and lot of her granddaughters and was with her and we um we were out I guess it was last Tuesday and for the first time since March of 2023 she walked almost six miles in one day see there amen so we just thank the Lord that I mean I I was there the day she couldn't hardly take one step and so just to see and she she went to 10,000 we took pictures with her all the girls has taking pictures and so it's been kind of a special week we just wanted to be able to see her meet meet that and and uh not only she she do 10,000 I think she end up about 16,000 that day and the next day she did another 15 or 16,000 the next day she did it again and so uh we just thank the Lord and but now now we got they took her home to to rest so it didn't mean to overwork her but I just thank God that for his mercy and I believe that God is is still a Healer and and you know he's he's he there there's more than than healing in our bod sometimes it takes a spirit to come by and and to menend things that's been broken to allow you to have the the strength to even want to uh take another step and I just I just think the Lord for what he's done and I sure appreciate the Lord and and thank him for all he's doing we want to remember these uh prayer requests this morning have a prayer request for Grandma Betty she's in the hospital they took her there a couple of days ago and and U or maybe yesterday morning but I just remember her in prayer over in Jonesboro and uh they're trying they got her in the heart uh Center over there and I believe that the Lord is able to intervene and I know she's weak in her body

God that you'll just speak to our hearts this morning in a special way that you'll anoint us aresh once again Lord in Jesus Christ wonderful name and the bride says amen God bless you it's good to be the house of the Lord if you got your Bibles and invite you to Psalms chapter 100 last time we was with you we ended actually on this um these couple Psalms we'll be reading this morning and Psalms 101 says Make a Joyful Noise unto the Lord Lord Can someone say praise the Lord in other words David was recounting his benefits and giving thanks to his God serve the Lord with gladness come before his presence with singing know you that the Lord he is God and he that have made us and not we ourselves we are his people and the Sheep of his Pastor the Lord is my shepherd I shall not wand and enter into his gates with Thanksgiving and to his courts with praise be thankful unto him and bless his name amen can you say praise the Lord this morning have you take your seats this morning now we've we preached many times on David and and the situations that David seemed to get himself into and how the enemy brother Mark was constantly chasing him and things was always transpiring and I thought about this this morning as I was meditating and looking upon these things and I believe there was a reason that David was attacked I believe there was a reason why the devil was upset with David cuz no matter what David went through he would continue encourage himself by the word and he would recount his God's benefits and he would give thanks to God and Brother David no matter what David went through there was a Melody down inside of David's heart that no matter how much pressure Saul put upon him no matter what how many javelins was throw upon and take his life there was a Melody that was placed down there not by David not by the church not by his friends but it was placed there by almighty God and that Melody no matter what happened to David a been kept singing a song in his life he kept praising his God and bless blessing his name and amen and he would make statements like Psalms 23 amen the Lord is my shepherd I shall not want amen the one thing that David knew he said it's not my myself it's not my ability I didn't make myself it was God that anointed to me it was God that gives me strength it is God that though I walk through the shadow of the of death I fear no evil for thou art with me th rod and th sta thou comfort me amen that was a Melody down inside of David's heart and then sister Vana no matter what he went through that Melody can never be silenced and I thank God in 2024 The Darkest Hours that we're living in there is a Melody that's been placed in The Bride of Jesus Christ's heart and no matter what TR uh what transpires in our life no matter what kind of Darkness that we're facing could never ever silence the melody that God put down in our hearts we sing because we're happy we praise him because it's a Melody down inside of our hearts they said it like this it's just like fire shut up in my bones can you say amen amen Psalms 92 David make this statement he says though those that be planted in the house of the Lord shall flourish they should grow they should a achieve they should Thrive they should sore like eagles listen he said when the 120 went in the upper room there came a sound like a from Heaven Like A Mighty Wind it blew open the doors it flew open the windows and out in the streets these men went testifying under the power of the impact of the Holy Spirit they were strongly affected by The Presence of Jehovah it changed them listen to what brother B said here he said but all of a sudden the Dynamics came and he said what did it do if not only filled their spirit inside but it quickened their mechanics their bodies would quickened they were no more cowards they went right out in the face of the people you men of Judea and all that dwell in Jerusalem where before the Dynamics come they were just the mechanics you men that dwell in Jerusalem let it be known and hearken unto my words these are not drunk as you suppose I'm one of them that's it he said I'll show you what it is he said it's the scripture that's it he said that's it let me keep this till that comes it changed them it done something to them it instilled something in them I believe brother Matt if you ever come in contact with this presence you'll never be the same again brother Brown said it changed them it quickened them it made them different oh aren't you glad to be different Brother David this morning Hallelujah they were changed people that's right it quickened them from the old life of being a coward to the like the line of the tribe of Judah they absolutely face mortal nailed to the cross crucified upside down they was burnt throw in the Lion's Den but there were no more cowards death had no victory over them at all the Dynamics was in the mechanics he said yes sir it quickened their mortal bodies no wonder Paul said oh death where is our sting oh grave where is our Victory Glory the Dynamics is in the mechanics watch out depression watch out funny feelings watch out sickness watch out amen if the Dynamics ever gets wrapped up in the mechanics there is a move brother he it's a move that hell can stop when they came out of the upper room they was changed beforehand there was cowards they was afraid they couldn't speak Brothers but when they came out of underneath that presence they had boldness amen and they had strength they had ability they were changed Daniel says but the people that do know their God shall be strong and do exploits in other words they should be they should stand firm and take action they continue steadfast and all can you say all all Temptations the the this people will look at their God over circumstances these people will look at God over their problems they will look to God in their sickness they will look to God in their bad times brother you can look to God even in your time of Sorrow you can look to God Amen I know I can't but God can I know I'm a failure but God isn't I know I make mistakes but God can I know I can't overcome it but God can I say this morning it's going to take a stronger win than this to keep the Believers for possessing the gates of their enemy it's not because we come to Grace Tabernacle it's because the greater is living and ruling and reigning in humanity and he's placed a Melody there oh in this age he's placed the melody and he sealed it hallelujah thank God for a seal a promise this morning how many can Shout with me on that amen when everything else is falling around me amen I'm sealed when the world is falling around me I'm sealed amen when this flesh gets weak I'm sealed amen when this body gets sick I'm sealed in other words brother Ben there's nothing that can ever change Who I Really Am problems doesn't change it Church problems doesn't change it religions don't change it amen politics doesn't change it nothing can change what God did hallelujah oh thank God am my deepest despair when I was laying at a point amen I didn't know which way to turn brother Travis thank God there was a Melody down inside of my soul that kept singing out Praises unto God when I was ready to give up the melody was still there amen when I was ready to quit that song kept playing in my heart get up get up in Jesus name this is your day this is the bride's time this is the bride's Revival amen and nothing in time can silence the melody that's in our hearts the people that know their God how many knows their God this morning in the power of his resurrection amen shall be strong and do exploits we've heard many times brother R them talking about the 12 Spies and he makes mention how they brother M they went over and 12 of them was spent over sent over to spy out to find out to observe to look around and my when they those 12 Spies came back there was something different with Joshua and Caleb they found them they found the good land they found the promises that was within the land they brought back grapes that took two men to pack out they found the the the milk and honey they seen the milk and honey flowing just like God said it would be Morgan I I thought of this this morning how that two men could come back with 10 others there was murmur and complainers discouraged because they seen Giants but two could be bouncing up and down brother B said the hook knows Jew standing there bouncing up and down excited in a revivable and no Wonder brother Brenham said that that milk and honey would make a good Pentecostal cocktail it's enough to stir our souls up this morning Hallelujah full of new wine what they found Sister Jordan changed their mentality those other 10 came back with a slave mentality we can't do this and we can't do that and we can't take the land there's no way we could take the land but Joshua and Caleb came back with the attitude that some of us have in 2024 amen if nobody else wants to come to have church amen let me tell you about a god that is real amen there's a land that Flo with milk and honey amen and they said we are more than able to take the land this is my time this is Eagle time this is my Revival and I wonder this morning if it didn't uh prick their heart sister Tammy to realize I've never owned anything I've been a slave under the taskmasters whip for all these years I've beaten but I've held on to that promise I sat there for years and hundreds of years waiting for my opportunity and when they tasted of the promises of God it changed them like it changed you and I and for the first time they realize this is my land this is my time this is my possession Hallelujah good old Pentecostal cocktail and brother BR says right new bottles and new skin it's got oil on it it's got anointing on it he said that new skin will stretch when it begin to preach the gospel the baptism of the Holy Spirit the love of God Divine Healing signs and wonders a new skin when the Bible said Jesus Christ is the same yesterday today forever he said the new skin will say the new skin will say he says that's right it's stretched out a Pentecostal is a experience and it's what you receive Hallelujah I believe he's the same amen heyen we want some men and ladies who's flexible that has new skin can I read that quote brother Matt I'll read it really quick back in the beginning there was a tree God's Heritage back there which was his Vine and it was a new church and I had Fellowship had everything just right and Along come one of the HX to eat this out and another one ate that out and this one ate that one out and became nothing but a big old empty spooking looking place he said every time the wind would blow they' just moan and he said every time God repeats Pentecostal experience the only thing these big old mors can do is stand there and go the days of Miracles has passed there's no such thing as them there we don't want a move of God we don't need that kind of preaching today we don't want that preacher melon in our lives we don't want the move of the Holy Spirit oh my heyen but if we have some flexible if we have some new skin if we have some new bottles amen that is prepared to take on the new wine which is the holy spirit oh can we have some new skins here this morning heyen can we have we don't want a bunch of old dried up bottles this morning hey baby because the new wine will just bust it to pieces he said there such a thing just as spooky as it can be to try listen to what the what brother Brown was saying here try to drive the people from it away from it I thought well then why do you send the wind Lord why do you send it anyhow I tell you why because they have some Noah and they have some Joe's and they have a Joe and they have a John come on somebody amen why does he still send the wind when there's still dead churches there's still dried up bottles there's still old hides it's because there's still some predestinated seeds there's still somebody that wants a away to the Lord there sell somebody that wants to praise their God hallelujah why do you send it anyhow they're done they're finished they'll never receive it just like them old cides were done dried and set there's no way of trying to tell them anything cuz they'll never believe it they're done got set callous dried out that's all of it but I thought why do you send the wind Lord but then I remember remember Joel said but I will restore sayeth the Lord I Hey listen I'm determined tonight God's going to have a witness go God's going to he's an OB worship he's going to have somebody that's going to praise His name I'm going to be that person I'm going to be the man this morning I'm going to be the man that says this is that and turn this thing around I know there's spirits in the land amen doesn't want the move of God doesn't want people amen seeing who God really is they're afraid they're afraid that God might expose something that they don't want exposed that was free don't you like a Hillbilly's preaching here not mine cow hides dry hides spooky places we can really understand it could we bunch of hillbillies around here too huh he said they're finished they'll never receive it but I thought why do you send it anyhow he said and I noticed down under these trees come up a bunch of undergrowth a little bunch of trees a new generation a Joshua and Caleb and he says every time the wind blows they're just flexible they're green he said the church might act like a little green but brother it's flexible to The Winds of God when it blows every time the wind when it blow those little trees would just laugh and jump and joy boy I said if that ain't an oldfashioned Pentecostal meeting amen I never seen one oh I thought those little trees the wind blows are flexible God give us some flexible trees here this morning Hallelujah and he says they just move when the wind moves every time the wind blows it moves them they're not dead they're alive thank God that people can get a little fire in them thank God when when the spirit of God begins to minister Amen to his people there's still some flexible somebody that can still raise their hands Sister Janice still can praise God and still hey I'm right here I want to say I'm want of them [Applause] he's very much alive brother Mt don't tell that testimony it don't matter anyhow I say man that's like a good test it's like taking some gasoline Hey listen the fire never goes out but in a service you know what testimony how many's ever

perfect setup it's rigged it's riged rigged you know when I was a kid I used say just a few years ago it's been a minute now brother Morgan I can remember I lived there in in Porsche and little apartments over there and and uh I had one of my best friends and y'all might know him Anson orc and man we we we was uh Nintendo nerds we lived it we breeded it we did it every day you know we would he's over there I'd go over there and we play all day long and you know what I I thinking about this last night when I studying I I thought about the you know we would playing you know the game would get so hard we play Zelda and Contra Mike and Mike Tyson punch out but you know what it would come to a point we'd be going searching and we found this cold and we found out that this Cod was good for any of those makers whatever game they made it was good for it you remember up up down down left right left right ba start huh and all of a sudden the the screen would flash and all of a sudden everything would change you had unlimited power you have unlimited strength and I thought about a a Cod that's been broken in this day and a book that's been opened up in our hour amen that begin to let us know the screen has splashed and he said that sin that once wrote you the roll you any longer Hallelujah amen message says jump jump on your enemy now thought about that one sir my mom was a Mario freak too brother Mark you remember that turtle that used to come down that little that blocked brother day we figured out we can wait on that devil until he got to about that third block and then all of a sudden we push the B button to jump and we' jump on that turtle and all of a sudden we keep jumping on that turtle and all of a sudden it go I forget now 100 points 200 points th000 points and all of a sudden one power up one power up one power up you can sit there as long as you want to getting unlimited lives oh thank God hey B we would have never know that but somebody told us that and we believed him and we tried it amen we've got a message and I don't you want to tap it with this but I believe this message has gave us a Cod and it broke everything everything that we have the need of to sweep us from the garden to Eden to a Rapture was broke under the seals and it let us know exactly where we came from and it let us know exact ly where we're going to and it let us know we're trapped in time and it told us when that devil gets to that certain spot I want you to jump and ride that enemy all the way back to Camp I'm riding on it I'm riding on it I'm riding on it I believe that cold has unlocked unlimited resources that code if I could say it like this could be the Holy Spirit and the Holy Ghost is designed to dissolve any enemy standing between you and your promises and brother would say like this that great contest has been going on for many years it started in the heavens and Satan was kicked out on the earth then it becoming enemies of God's people and since then he used all of his strength and strategy to try to pull God's people across the fires and we know who has the most power does God does and God when he gave his people the best thing he could do to combat Satan with was his word because the word of God who's stronger than God the word is God and the word becomes our strength God in his church can't say with me this morning God in Me God in us becomes the strength to pull Satan to his own fires that he's made and the tug goes on Hallelujah I say the code's been Broken Hallelujah the code has been broken I've got to really hurry we drive up the he said said let me skip some of this God's good isn't he he says that's what it is no Ser brother it's get beneath the blood but they've just get beneath the blood yes don't talk about it get into it get into it don't talk about Joy this morning get into it let's taste of it this morning don't talk about love let's get into love let's don't talk about a Revival brother man let's get into it I want to be a partaker I don't want to just pit it I want to be a partaker this morning when I see the blood I'm going to pass over you so without this display of the token they perished there was no Resurrection for them you've got to come beneath the blood now just don't talk about it he said receive it hear me the prophet said hear me he's breaking a code hear me hear me in the name of the Lord hear me got to be beneath the blood he he was not responsible for any persons from that wasn't beneath the blood God made it clear that all from under the blood would p perish God is not responsible for any person small big popular un Rich poor Bond of free male a female he's not responsible for anybody you say but oh Lord I did this I cast out Devils I preached the gospel depart from me you that work iniquity I never knew you he only recognized the token and God took an oath what was out from under would perish and all that was under it would live Hallelujah say the code's been broken you're predestinated there's the mystery he says before Christ or anything else was ever on Earth you see his great mystery that he chose a bride knowing he would fall from disbelieving the word knowing that she would fall but he chose a bride that would not fall they would hold to the word regardless what the rest of the world said about it they would hold to the word how many he's holding to the word this morning see he says and taking the word and making up his church Eve see back to himself again Redeemed by the blood that was given from his body and there there would be a Time come forth that he would Express himself in the fullness of the godhead digity now he says a preeminence in a church he says anointed man now the anointed people to bring back anointed Bride for his bridegroom you see it now he said what Eve turned down he's coming back and we accept he told Eve don't you do this don't you do that you can do this and you can't do that Satan said oh you know but she turned around and listen to him but the eve and the last day is not going to do it because she is pre destinated the cod's been broken God's going to do it God's going to do it he knows how we going to do exports God's going to do it and there will be a church without spot or wrinkle the first seed fell brother Brown says she was made for deception she was made to fall but the second Eve because the Cod has been broken in our day told us that first Eve fell but this second Eve she's predestinated she's not going to fall she's predestinated to this glorious stand so one was made for deception and the fall the other Eve was made God came down in his mind before the foundation of the world by for knowledge he could predestinate and he could place seeds down inside of you not at an altar sister Destiny but before the foundation of the world God broke the cold he better tell you you you want a chicken to begin with you was always a son you was always an eagle Hallelujah and the other one she was made she was made sister Joy God Made You redeemable because he placed a seed in you and because a seed remains in you amen you're a child of God can lay there dormant for so long amen but there's a predestinated moment of time where that seed will have to come to life before God listen don't you love it don't you love the message and how it broke the code he says you know what you're not just forgiven Sister Mary you're Justified as though you've never done it to begin with listen it how how's that possible a God that knows every flee that bats his eyes brother the mat you

thinking we're all different in our in our learning but God sister Vanna God and Jesus will make a statement be you therefore perfect how's the way then Jesus we find him saying there hanging on a cross between Heaven and Earth he screamed out it is finished and that word finished comes from the same root word that be you perfect and I believe that's exactly what he was saying God spoke it through Jesus Christ be you therefore perfect and Christ and when when he was dying on the cross let you know sister Tammy you can't but God [Music] can in Christ there's completion in Christ so now you may be be able to see my flaw but God but God is looking through the mediator and he can't see my flaws he don't even know they exist and Jesus Oh what Amazing Grace and when you're buried in Christ it begins to dissect your past and goes back and it lands upon the enemy and it lays there and when God looks through the blood of Jesus Christ he sees me why is though this morning he sees me redeemed SE by the blood of Jesus Christ and brother Brandon broke the Cod and he said there ain't even Trace there's no evidence there's no evidence that that the devil could put against you he annihilated everything there ain't even a smell that you ever done it in the first place hallelujah oh don't you love him she'll be a token to the world in closing she'll be a token to the world well

her that you ought to cherish it amen to be able to let her know what she means to you certainly uh wonderful day sister Eve is with sister Betty this morning that's why she isn't here she remember them in prayer I think we're going to go over that way this evening and and just thank the Lord for all that he's done for us I have some things that uh I'll sh I was going to share but I'll just wait till next Sunday uh we've got our fellowship hall uh finished and ready and and some has been using it already and uh you know they've been contacting Sarah to uh to we want to make it available for the church to be able to use uh I've talked to several other you know pastors and ministers that had Fellowship halls and uh I've always been that kind of a person I don't uh I try to find some people that have some wisdom on situations that that I haven't been to yet so I've never had a fellowship off so uh just to find a way to uh be able to use it that it would be edifying to the body we built it to be a help and uh so we certainly want you to be able to use it so uh here in a few days we'll have a uh a list of rules and things just to keep order and uh of how things will be though it it's going to be fair for everybody if you've talked to Sarah over the last few days she's not going to be in charge of that um but just because we didn't have it listed we're going to put a calendar in there for people to be able to use it um but if there's any questions or concerns or dates or or questions or anything about it I'm going to be the person to call so if you have any questions about it and you need to know about it or want to use it everybody here has my phone number or text message and uh if you text my wife about it she's only going to ask me the question and the response you're going to get is going to come from me uh so she's not going to go anywhere different than what I would say so uh we want to do that and be able to have it as a place that the church could be able to use and and I know it's it's a lot of a building a lot of expenses and uh things so uh we want to just try to uh keep as in as much order as we can and and allow you to use it are you thankful for it amen amen so in a few days we'll have that up there and we'll kind of go over go over that and um just to be that everybody could have opportunity to use it we want everybody in the church to be able to benefit from it uh it was your efforts and money that built it and so we want you to be able to to have the benefit from it so uh but we'll we'll kind of go over that uh next week you remember those in prayer uh that need prayer and also today uh uh I guess brother Connor is going to get baptized this afternoon so uh we're going to go down to the poh hatan landing and baptize him and he's he's he's excited to go and he may be preaching for us next Wednesday I don't know that young man looks sharp there just he loves the Lord and my just a wonderful I think it's a good Zeal in the heart of a young man uh to want to dedicate their life to the Lord and and it's been on his heart and asked his parents so we just want to remember that this afternoon I guess uh I know it's Mother's Day and many will be with their Ms and things so we uh we appreciate that and um but we'll probably just come back there about uh I would say about 5:00 or so because it may be a a different you know times getting in and out of restroom and stuff will be a a little bit later so if that'll be okay with his mom and dad then that's then that'll that'll work so we're going to do that about 5:00 at the poh hatan Lon so if you could just bow your heads together and just remember Sister Betty and your prayers as we go gracious Heavenly Father Lord how we are so thankful Lord for your presence here this morning and Lord we thank you for the word that has gone forth and Lord just uh what a reminder that it is Lord that we want to be green God to be flexible in the spirit and Lord to allow our our spirit to be moved Lord we never want to get into that callous condition in our life and Lord where bitterness and things would come up and and keep us from being able to have love one for another and God being able to receive you Lord we know that there's that your spirit is a timid spirit and Lord I know how the enemy would be so careful to make an atmosphere where that you wouldn't feel welcome but Lord we as a body of Believers we have a right to rebuke that same enemy Lord we have a right to make an atmosphere where your presence is welcome and Lord I Thank you for our brother and the words that were spoken this morning and God may as we go from this place Lord I pray a special blessing upon each of our mothers here today and Lord may this be a special day and a special time and God may we display the real love and affection that we have for them and God there's no love that's close closer to your love than a mother's love and Lord we're so thankful for them this morning Lord
