wonderful God tonight amen how many loves the Lord amen we just come to be able to hear a word from the Lord tonight I know it's a Wednesday night many took off this old hot day of working and just to take and just a lot of a lot of tired days in the summer and but we just appreciate the sacrifice to come and fulfill the scripture and and forsake not to assemble ourselves together tonight amen just to be in the presence of the Lord and I believe that there ain't ever a time that you can go to the house of God and and expect something from the Lord that God don't come and do something for you amen I believe that's the kind of God that we serve amen we just want to remember in prayer tonight sister uh Sandy and and her family there and she heard had she had given such a wonderful report of of her family and the services and things and how much that they appreciated the church and all that was done for them and uh certainly appreciate you for making the sacrifices in order to uh to do that and and matter of fact her one of her sons came up to me and told me he said you know I didn't um he said I didn't uh or ever been to a place where a man was honored like a like our father was honored by by you guys and so we just want to thank you from bottom of our heart and and just just appreciate each one and certainly remember them in prayer also uh April Nichols in prayer she's still in the hospital in Jonesboro Nea and uh she had had a stroke a few days ago and uh wasn't able to uh move anything on our left side and they got the test and things back and the doctor had given them a a very negative report initially that that it looked like that she may never use the left side of her body again and I know we have many that have been praying and we went by there yesterday with sister Judy Brother Don and uh some of the family that had came by and and the spirit of the Lord just moved into the room and I know that I I I don't know a lot of things but I know when God comes near and I've been in this in the presence of the Lord long enough for many times and enough to know when he comes by and he he hears what we what we pray and he knows what we have need of and but just a real sweet Spirit just moved down into the room and and I I believe that that the Lord will just continue to touch her and I think uh yesterday she even was able to move her feet a little bit and and they're they're going to try to get her into some recovery and Rehab but I believe that God is more than able uh to restore and and I just don't I don't want to see God just heal her body but I want him to rest store fully and and that that she would just be a a new creation in Christ that's all that's what we all needed you know we come to a place that we just want God to make us a new and God is that kind of a God and and uh I just appreciate the Lord for doing that if you remember her in prayer and maybe you have a need on your heart tonight just well praise the Lord yeah we had a request earlier to pray for brother Keith they were in Jamaica in line for that hurricane but she just gave a report that uh that all they got was some strong winds and things so they they were able to escape that and but I know many weren't so just remember those families in prayer tonight if we bow our heads together if you have a need just lift your hand to the Lord gracious Heavenly Father

the victory has been won praise the lord it's good to be in the house of the Lord tonight sure enjoyed the songs and the brother mark leading the service tonight just to feel his presence come down and my God's good to us if you got your Bibles tonight is turn to 1 Corinthians chapter 15 verse 40 just read down to verse 49 he says there are also celestial bodies and bodies terrestrial but the glory of the celestial is one and the glory of the terrestrial is another there's one glory of the sun another glory of the Moon and another glory of the stars for one star different from another star in glory so also is the resurrection of the dead it's swn in corruption is raised in corruption it's sown in dishonor is raised in glory it is sown in weakness it's raised in power it's sown a natural body it's raised a spiritual body there's a natural body and there's a spiritual body and so it is written the first man Adam was made a living Soul the last Adam was made a quickening spirit how about that which not first which is spiritual but that which is natural and afterward that which is spiritual the first man is of the earth Earthly the second man is a Lord From Heaven as as is the Earthly such as they also they are Earthly as also the Heavenly such are they also that are Heavenly as we are born to wear the image of the Earthly we shall also bear the image of the Heavenly can we just bow our hearts one more time tonight as we pray Lord Jesus Lord certainly it's good to be in your presence tonight Lord Lord we thank you for the wonderful services that you have given us us here at Grace Tabernacle Lord and have you overshadowed our services with your presence Lord the sick has been healed Lord there's been many miracles and deliverance Lord as we just want to thank you tonight Lord for giving us this opportunity here Lord God to have another service that we can worship you in spirit and in truth father Lord we invite you tonight to come by and minister to our hearts once again Lord as we took the time and prayer and study Lord and looking at different things coming through the message Lord But Here We Are Tonight Lord God waiting for the Holy Spirit to come and minister to your Saints once again Lord we commit this service into your hands Lord that you'd come and have your way we pray in Jesus Christ name amen God bless you God bless you last time we was here we we ministered on he has given us the land and and we G through a lot of scriptures and we was looking how that God would tell us it's your land it's uh and we was looking how that that uh that uh it's nothing it's not something just way off in the future somewhere but we're here reaping the benefits of Calvary and I'd like to take a moment tonight to minister to your hearts amen that something the Lord's laid on our hearts the last several days on reflecting your inheritance and we would think on inheritance Brother David our minds a lot of times go back to to the days of theirs Moses and how that Abraham had made a promise God had made a promise through Abraham thank you brother that they was going to sojourn in a land for so many years 400 years and they would and they would that God was going to deliver them with a mighty hand and it not used to singing before I preach my mouth's dry but but God had their in had them in their mind the whole time and I thought about that brother Matt how we go through a lot of you just testifying how the Lord hey came on the scene in your behalf when you gave your heart to the Lord I and I thought that all the things that we go through all the things that transpires in our lives and we go down some dark roads we've all we' we've all came through them times in our lives and but I I want to believe tonight and I believe through the message of the hour that God was watching over his inheritance amen his in his Heritage from day one when you was in your when you was formed in your mother's womb God knew that you was there he he watched over your birth he watched you every day of your life amen cuz God had a plan for you and I believe it's exactly the way he did with the children of Israel that day amen God watched every time they they they took the taskmasters with and they beat him amen God watched every time they was down in the mud holes of Egypt making brick and the mortar and and sweating and made fun of and talked about and scandalized amen God was standing back amen don't you think for a minute that God wouldn't had a plan and that God was God wasn't going to remember everything they done to the children of God Amen God Amen has you on his mind in interest amen every everything that you go through Heen the Bible tells us Romans 8:28 all things work for the good that them that are called them that love their God Amen everything's working out for your good amen even amen the bad things even the Terrible Things in fact brother R said you know that trouble has got bits in his mouth God has put bits in the mouth of trouble brother Travis He he controls trouble he controls hell he controls the devil listen friends a but nothing happens to you by coincident I'm telling you we serve a powerful God he's all knowing he's all powerful he's everywhere tonight and he was there that day when he was repairing A Man Called Moses in the back side of the desert beating everything out of him to a place where he could find used Moses to go down as well probably God would call it as a oneman Invasion to go down and take over Egypt and here comes Moses what a paradox that a man and his wife on a mule or camel going down to a great nation of Egypt with all their artillery with all their Warriors all their soldiers with all their strength with all their power power but here come a man that was a reflecting home that was going to reflect his inheritance and he goes down not under the altar not under the plan of Moses but under the plan of almighty God and he told him to go down there and begin to tell pharaoh to let my people go could you imagine what kind of paradox that must have been amen as they went down no doubt they was made fun of but that laugh would begin to stop when they begin to see there was power and authority behind the voice of Moses Hallelujah didn't mean to spend much time on that tonight but but there was a god orchestrating this out am been to a place where for Pharaoh family told Moses to get out take all that you got don't keep nothing behind take everything you got and get out of Egypt and there goes Israel out of bondage headed to the promised land and there comes a place of the Red Sea and and here God moves again in their behalf and then there comes an enemy in like a flood but God raises up a standard against the enemy and all night long but the next morning at the rising of the sun brother Mark that God begins a move God begins to move and here come brother jareda wind of Yahweh from the heavens and begin to divide the sea and here goes am been not just a church of 200 people but we're talking about a group of of two million people walking across on dry ground Hallelujah could you imagine what it sounded like amen when they got on the other side and the waters begin to come back upon their enemy and they looked back and seen that their enemy was dead you think Grace Tabernacle gets loud could you imagine when maram grabbed a tamarine Moses be to sing a new song they were screaming and shouting and rejoicing Hallelujah now they're looking back and seeing their enemy is dead and they begin to reflect home they begin to praise God they begin to Rejoice my don't be afraid to Rejoice tonight if they can Rejoice over a Red Sea conference Grace Tabernacle are you hearing me tonight am bet we got something to shout about if they can shout over that what about you and I amen we're been redeemed by the blood of an lamb an innocent lamb amen amen he became me that I could become him by grace and then they s joone further and Moses began to send some spies over and the spies went over and spied out the land and when they begin to come back maybe brother Wesley that the 10 spies was a little ahead of the others too and they got back to camp and they was for fatigued and they was wore out and it was hot that day and we worked hard that day and they had a church service at Wednesday night and they all come together and here was 10 that came back and no doubt could you imagine what kind of church service that must have been as they was sitting back waiting for this report they've been waiting to hear to see amen what kind of land this was and and they came back to that church service on Wednesday night amen and these 10 spies come back and begin to Bear the image of the Earthly has I begin to say you brother Amos there's no way there is no way we can take the land there's Giants that inhabit that land we look like grasshoppers in the side of those kings this is just me but maybe Joshua and Caleb came in a a littleit later got there a little late but they was packing some evidence that God's Not Dead He's Alive they been packing some evidence and no doubt sister Debbie they was wore out they was fatigued from the journey but when they got to the church service at Wednesday night they begin to testify they be we begin to Bear the image of the Heavenly as they begin to go beyond the Flesh and begin to talk from the spirit the scripture said there was another Spirit within Caleb and that spirit amen that bore the image of the Heavenly begin to scream out hey why are you discouraged why ain't you clapping tonight why ain't you singing tonight why why ain't you rejoicing tonight because they begin to listen to the 10 senses of the Flesh and the spirit and they begin to believe a lie but Joshua and K said hold on I'm here to tell you look at these graes look at the evidence we are more more than able to take the land Hallelujah we are more give me my Promised Land give me my inheritance give me my land give me my promises get behind me Satan tonight he been tormenting your mind he's been breaking down everything he can break down amen he's divided everything he could divide he sto everything that he can at you but I'm telling you Satan's best is not enough tonight Satan's best is not enough tonight you're here tonight come on somebody you're here tonight against all Lord you're here tonight devil Satan has throw everything he can at you a been at your family at your job your finances but I want to tell the devil here am I tonight here I standing tonight here am I backing the preacher tonight here am I singing the songs of Zion here am I singing he I rejoicing no wonder brother BR would pick that up and say never let your testimony be negative but he said but let it be positive all the time amen we get we live in this body we're trapped in humanity so it's so easy to speak negative and bear the image of the Earthly but can we tonight for a moment begin to Bear the image of the Heavenly and them Against All Odds when the odds are stacked against you when the doctor says there's no way when when the world says there's no way heyen when Satan has stacked everything against you to stop Grace Tabernacle to stop these dynes here tonight but here we are brother Bobby we're standing rejoicing living brother would say that something like this this is just the coat this ain't the real you sister this is only the coat it's the image of the Earthly it's just the cat brother would say the people just see you in this and what you was he said you the real you was on the inside of that but the O coat itself just bore the image of the heavenly he says you cannot be here spiritual being sinner or Saint without having an influence from the underworld or from the above world he said if you are influenced from here you're from above your Celestial body is waiting up here but if you're Wicked and hypocritical and indifferent your Celestial B's down here regardless of how much you think it's up there because the fruit the reflection that you bear before people proves where you're from so you are here what you are somewhere else your life that you live here is just a reflection of what your inheritance is when you leave here can I have a little bit more Moder brother and that's where I gathered my thought can I read it again your life that you live here is just reflecting what you're inherit in his when you live here we sing the song sometimes it's an old himym I'm going home sister Joyce I'm going home I'm Going Back Where I Belong I've caught a glimpse of my heavenly home praise God praise God I'm going home Hallelujah regardless of what hell has to say Brother David he could remind you of your past he can remind me of my past but that's gone by in time and no longer in existing what we have to realize tonight that we didn't become a son we always was a son hallelujah sister Martha amen you you was never a chicken you was always an eagle amen we might have been hatched out in in the age of Lady oia amen there's a lot of stuff that goes on but down inside of that H that that that that human body was laying a germ seed of life am been a portion of God a germ seed of almighty God that never had a beginning and never can have an end and it lays there dormant for so long as we bear the image of the Earthly we come to the world speaking lies shaped in iniquity amen we we we tell lies we fall short but one day amen there's a Holy Spirit and that was predestinated to come by your way and brood over you yes sir and that jerk SE maybe you had no idea you didn't know nothing about the message you didn't know nothing about being an eagle you know nothing didn't have an idea but all of a sudden The Presence of Jehovah God that whole journey your whole past but in God's mind I'm going get ahead of myself tonight God's good isn't he let me go on before I hit that thought he said what you are as I said in the beginning what you are somewhere else is what you reflect here do we have some calebs here tonight we're reflecting our inheritance we're shouting here because why brother Joe we're shouting here because we was shouting there did he make a statement said brother MD said where was you job where was you job when we laid the foundations where was you job when the sons were shouting for Joy I tell you brother Brown we make a statement like this amen you was existing brother Jonathan in the mind of God before the foundation of the world listen friends I was born of Dawn and Judy Reynolds but that is not my beginning that is not my first place my first place was before there was an earth before there was dust before there was a devil before there was a sky before there was an earth amen I existed in the mind of God he predestinated he predes me because of for knowledge he seen me Hallelujah do you feel it tonight was you there yes sir there is such a pull how many felt that pull there is such a great pull amen of from our heaven home we feel it when the when the when it get the going gets tough as a slogan says when the going gets tough when everything around you is falling apart in your greatest Gethsemane when you're at your lowest of your lowest there's God when your friends forsake you your church don't want you there's God when everybody else gave up on you there's God when they couldn't give you Mercy but there's God when they couldn't extend Grace but there's God Church there's a lot of people gave up on me but there was a God that could not give give up on me brother Wesley he came looking for me I was an eagle hatched out in the Barnard and Mama eagle flew over the Barnard he began to brood over that that little Eagle said Eagle come out of her my people oh it wasn't a call from a man it was a call from God [Music] hallelujah can we feel it tonight our cloudy days doesn't change the pool brother man would talk M he said talk about the kite he said the boy holding the kite he said he can't you can't see the kite he said but I can feel the pull and the tub from it I know it's still there I know my God was alive even when I'm going through the greatest Gethsemane amen when I was down in my lowest of lowest amen there was still a tug from home amen the world can silence Hallelujah don't you thankful for it tonight you could feel the vibrating of our soul when the world's ready to give up on you and you don't Brother David you don't think there's no way you can finish this race there's so much weight on you and then we can begin to feel the vibrations of home we begin to feel the vibration of his his word that can never come back void it says Joe you're going to make it brother Amos you're going to make it car you're going to make it the say you're going to make it tonight when the P so hard you're going to make it tonight it's not a it's not an outward pull it's an inward pull he says those who he fornew he called those who he called he justified those who is Justified he's already glorified he said what are you scared about the Antichrist in the last days according to Revelation deceive all that dwelt upon the face of the Earth Revelation 138 says the same thing says and all all that dwell upon the Earth shall worship him but all here doesn't mean me he said whose names are not written in the book of the Lamb that was slain before the foundation of the world he says and he's written not since the last Revival no but before the foundation of the world that's when your name was put in the Lamb's Book of Life where the lamb was slain God spoke the word it he was thinking it was his thought he spoke the word and everything happened just at that time this is just God's seed materializing Hallelujah I'm excited about that tonight listen devil my name is on the book man it was written by almighty god brother B said one place he wrote it and he spoke it Brother David his word can never come back void amen he's going to deceive all all that dwell upon the Earth is going to worship the Beast they're going to reflect their home they're reflecting their home homosexuality on the Rampage men marrying men women marrying women what some filth of Sodom this world is full of Filth drugs and alcohol and tobacco demons gambling demons what are they doing they are reflecting the image of the Beast and it's going to get all that dwell upon the Earth but those that God predestinated before there was a world before there was an existence of human beings before there was a devil before there was Lucifer God wrote your name on the land Book of Life and he took your picture and he put it on fou yes sir how you like that tonight God's family album you know we got them you know I don't got them my wife's got them and she's got pictures of everything and she's got albums of you know they that that's they're memories you know I can go back on my phone and I can go back and look at pictures and there's nobody takes more pictures than brother Matt mois he's got evidence of everything you know and I and I we can go back to those brother Mt and I can go back and I'll be scrolling through there like I did the other day and I could I seen a picture there and I could and I thought man that was me and Mt out Cado and we was using binoculars was using our phones to video a beautiful moose with big aners and I could and I that was a memory that was a picture that we took and we can look back how many's ever look back to pictures and said man you know I was I didn't have that you know I didn't have this gray hair sister Eve we can look back my wife's got plenty of videos of of brother Dave and sister Eve some of y'all probably to look at they're memories it's way we go back down memory lane and we can look back at a present time but God's family Al on the opposite he took a picture when you was existing in the mind of him before the foundation of the world and we're only here reflecting what we was there we're only here materializing the very thought that God had of us it's not a thought of defeat it's not a a thought of failure no no no no no no brother BR said he took that picture at your very best amen yes sir Carter when you were spotless when you was pure when you was right everything was just perfect come on somebody God's a perfect God he's perfected so when he's thought of you in the beginning nothing in time I say there's a lot but it's so good nothing in time can change what God had in his family album before the foundation of the [Applause] world Hallelujah so we don't Rejoice tonight because Spirits are subject to us we Rejoice tonight because God wrote our names in the L's book of life before the foundation of the world so we're here in time reflecting an image that was tucking in the heavens oh that's deep tonight Hallelujah I got to skip some of this but it's so good tonight can I just read that one quote I just quoted is that all right God takes a picture of you that picture brother Brown said brother Noah is the main thing when was it tuen before the foundation of the world it was put in God's file that picture is the absolutely this is the negative this is a negative part of the life the bore the image of the Earthly amen where you're living now this is a negative has got to be a positive before they can be a negative there's a negative there's got to be a positive somewhere and this isn't the real thing oh praise God tonight this isn't the real thing Hallelujah and this is only the foreshadow of a real thing that is coming so I don't care what they would do with you I don't care what they do with you they can destroy they cannot destroy the profile that God filed in his own album before the foundation of the world it's a picture of God great gra Galley up there and they cannot destroy it it's in heaven you can burn it up you can feed this to the Lions but anyway do anything you want to it but God said it'll come forth again Hall thank God for Resurrection thank God for a message of the hour tonight that let us know when we have loved ones that go beyond the curtain of time and lay down in the grave that that ain't their final Place amen there's not a replacement God doesn't replace it's resurrection that God's going to call that same self 16 element body one day out of the grave what a promise what a promise it'll come forth again God's family album the picture he placed in his album we are here in time reflecting that image God seen you overcoming so I say tonight you know what sister you're going to overcome amen sister Tammy you're going to overcome if God seen you overcoming before the foundation of the world nothing in time can change that thought for when sometime in darkness but now we are the light in the in the Lord walk as children of Light walk as children of Life reflecting our Heavenly home we're here reflecting the power of the Sun the moon and the sun brother BR says represent Christ and the church in other words the moon and the sun are husband and wife the Moon is only reflecting the shadow of the sun the sun is shining on the moon aren't you thankful sir that the s o n is shining on us tonight the moon in the son or husband and wife and the Sun is the light of the Moon the sun is shining on the moon and the moon reflects the light to the earth when it's dark brother BR would say the Moon is the Watchdog he controls God he said God would set the boundaries but God would place the moon here in the dark time to look back to them tidal waves and when it begins to sneak in as she turns around brother Brown said he said then and she could begin to scream out that's far enough oh oh I think we can do that tonight amen we're reflecting the image of the Earthly long enough amen cuz somebody Caleb tonight begin to Bear the image of the Heavenly and begin to reflect the light of the S so n on and begin to reflect the light of the Su of man amen and when the enemy begins to turn on our family begin to turn on a church and C to tries to cause the vision it's time for the authority of the Moon and then the Watchdog that God has set here and say hey no no no you've tormented my family long enough you tormented my church long enough Satan you have no rights here you say will he leave absolutely the devil will have to move CUA it's not just any woman it's not just any lady this is the the moon the wife of the son and we have the right and when those ways begin to creep in our lives little bitterness begins to creep in our life well when a brother does so and so to you and you get these funny feelings about your brother oh let me tell you a secret t i we bore the image of the Earthly long enough I wish I had the quotes I read in front of me Amen brother B said when you begin to have that love for your brother and sister amen when you can go the extra mile for your brother and sisters come on somebody tonight I'm here to tell you I'm preaching to you now been it's time able to let feelings go it's time to let division go it's time to let differences [Music] [Applause] go it's time for a cleaning from the pullit to the back door and say this is the this is the day that the Lord has made and I'm going to Bear the image of the Heavenly I'm going to start reflecting my inheritance Hallelujah he said those big waves start creeping in the Moon is St there and he says brother Matt got the authority Moon can say peace be still yeah Hallelujah we have the authority of the son in in the age that we're living in and say waves Waters you have creeped into my family far enough you've came and destroyed my children long enough you've tried to destroy my family you've come in long enough but I'm taking a stand tonight as authority of the king and says Satan you have no Liberty here any longer and I'm telling you whatever you bind on Earth it be bound in the heavens whatever you begin to loose brother Noah on Earth will be Loos in the heavens power do you have then we have a we had a messenger in this age begin to tell us right now we reign with Jesus Christ having dominion over sin the devil in the flesh Hallelujah this message wasn't sent to stay in letter form but to become flesh to prepare us for translation from Mortal to immortality behold I send unto you Elijah tells us somebody somewhere is going to reflect this message be become the message and the message becomes you if God sends a message the message says amen the reflection says amen if God's message says we can make it amen the reflection says I'm going Hallelujah If the message of the hour is speak and go forward the reflection of our inheritance is somebody that's bearing the image of the heavenly says I don't care what I feel I don't care what anybody says about me I don't care what people running me down I don't know I don't care what my job is doing to me I don't care what finances is doing to me but for me in my house I'm going to serve the Lord I'm going to come to church I'm going to praise my Lord I'm going to Rejoice I'm going to sing I'm going to shout I'm going to run I'm going to dance because we have a right to Bear the image of the Heavenly he says in the days of Luke 17 and 20 he said Jesus said when the son of man's being revealed not men the son of man not an organization the son of man the word living itself again amongst the people see he says the word itself made flesh in you isn't that powerful the word itself is there anything more powerful than God's word brother Amos he simply says the word itself that can never come back void that can never be conquered can never be stopped can never be defeated listen what is this statement the word itself is made flesh not just in a prophet right come on and we believe he was but he made it brother Brown would say the word itself made flesh not in me but you he said you are a reflection of this hour the message what is it God making himself real in humanity and of these coats it's a paradox he said the word itself making flesh and you the reflection of the hour the message what is the message the word itself made flesh in you when the son of man is being revealed how is he being revealed by somebody reflecting the and bearing the image of the Heavenly it's Christ Christ in me the hope of glory you are a reflection of the message you live again don't you love that see he says see you live again live the life that was in Jesus Christ you're in the presence of the S so n hallelujah oh dry bones and brother R would say in Christ The Mystery of God reveal oh Dry Bones he said I wish I could grab that out for a moment tonight oh dry bone can these Dry Bones live again can these images of Flesh live again can there be a power of Jesus Christ Living in the church again can there be another revival can there be a bride's revival can there be a a a a somebody somewhere reflecting the message that Christ in you the hope of glory I say yes tonight I say Amen tonight how can you today I'm here to tell you I'm a witness I'm a witness that Jesus Christ is not dead he's alive I'm a witness tonight I adore the image of the Earthly but now I've turned Heavenly can these Dry Bones live again in can they reflect the prophecy I'm here to tell you sister Eve when that went as brother Matt preached the Breath of God was breathed upon these sling bones amen and there was bones scattered everywhere you know what the message did it began to bring all those bones back in position again and the message of the hour he they begin to TI all these Loose Ends no more cow eating in the top of the tree brother B begin to tie in all these sins and these bones begin to come together what was happening under the ministration of this message amen God getting himself a body to come and roll and raid over the devil and he slipped down in Satan 's Eden and Satan's Eden he's came down and made himself flesh for you to reflect the message of the hour that is God in you Christ in youo it's just like fire shut up on my bones church heyen we begin to Bear the image of the Heavenly you don't have to talk to S the shouting we don't have to call your favorite preacher up here to make you stand and Shout no the word of God the word of God that moves us we're moved by the power of almighty God we're not moved by man's anointing we're moved by God's anointing moved by him and him alone brother Matt that's the way God wanted it can these bones live again water a Revival I know I ain't going to get done tonight but that's okay I'll preach on something something else next time that's the way a preacher does he studies and studies and studies and gets all these pages and ready to go and they don't get through two of them but you know what I wouldn't take nothing for it David if it's me getting up here where we just we wasting an hour of our time and God's tonight but thank God we can yield our vessels enough amen that there's people out here in need to hear something I didn't have an idea what anybody needed but God orchestrated this service out I'm telling you before the foundation of the world he knew what problems you'd be in and he wanted you to hear this tonight all is going to reflect the image of the Beast whose names is not written in in the L's book of life cuz she's going to reflect something else oh Church could you imagine what it's going to be like there was two million shouting out there on the banks of that red sea you imagine what it going no wonder brother B said don't worry about your neighbor if he's shouting don't worry about your uh if somebody's screaming and running and shouting don't worry about that Heen when you get over there this is the quietest place you would ever be because when you get over there when you get over there there's going to be a lot of noise say brother Joe you believe in Emotion absolutely do I believe in fanaticism absolutely not but I believe in absolutely there's emotion behind this message there's motions behind this anointing come on listen friends this message is not dead and neither is their signicant behold you you are not dead and if we're going to be rejoicing over there I say tonight we need to reflect here we need to reflect our inheritance right here and begin to go ahead and have pre time let's have a little warmup tonight how about it you go to a basketball game they have their little layup and warm-ups they stretch they jump they scream they're rejoicing in the basketball spirit and I'm guilty I'm as
