[4:39] would not even know each other without
[4:41] this great end time word that you've
[4:43] sent to gather us together now Lord as
[4:46] we Endeavor this morning to take a few
[4:47] moments in your word we're asking your

[4:51] supernatural way Lord may you take these

[5:31] hide us behind the cross of Calvary
[5:34] transform Our Lives by Your Word this
[5:36] morning in Jesus Christ's name we pray
[5:39] and all the believer
[5:41] says amen and amen God bless you this
[5:44] morning if you have your Bibles while
[5:46] you're standing we want to go to the
[5:47] Book of Psalms the 62nd chapter amen
[5:50] also good to see our friends here from
[5:52] Louisiana God bless you all this morning
[5:54] amen Psalms chapter
[5:56] 62 and then we're going to look in
[5:58] Proverbs and also of the book of
[6:00] Jeremiah amen you love the Lord this
[6:03] morning amen Psalm
[6:05] 62 and verse number
[6:08] five the Bible here says my soul wait
[6:12] thou only upon God for my expectation is
[6:17] from him he only is my rock and my
[6:22] salvation he is my defense I shall not
[6:27] be moved and God is my salvation and my
[6:31] glory the rock of my strength and my re
[6:36] my refuge is in him how many knows that
[6:39] in the Bible a rock represents a
[6:41] revelation so we could very easily say
[6:44] this morning the revelation of my
[6:46] strength is in God now in Proverbs
[6:50] chapter
[6:51] 24 Proverbs 24 we want to look there in
[6:55] verse number
[6:57] 13 Proverbs 24
[7:00] in verse number 13 my son eat thou honey
[7:04] because it is good and the honeycomb
[7:07] which is sweet to thy taste so shall the
[7:10] knowledge of wisdom be unto thy Soul
[7:13] when thou Hast found it then there shall
[7:16] be a reward and thy
[7:19] expectation shall not shall not be cut
[7:23] off I love that there shall be a reward
[7:26] there shall be knowledge and wisdom unto
[7:28] the soul and the expectation shall not
[7:31] be cut off now one other place I want to
[7:33] look is in the book of Jeremiah Jeremiah
[7:36] chapter 20 uh we know this verse here by
[7:39] heart to probably one of the most
[7:41] familiar verses that the Prophet
[7:43] Jeremiah is known for in Jeremiah
[7:47] chapter 20 and verse 9 he says this then
[7:51] I said I will not make mention of him
[7:54] nor speak anymore in his name but his
[7:58] word was in my heart how many can
[8:00] testify his word is in your heart but
[8:03] his word was in Mine Heart as a burning
[8:06] fire shut up in my bones and I was weary
[8:10] with forbearing and I could not stay
[8:13] amen we ask Lord this morning to add the
[8:15] blessing to the reading of his word as
[8:16] you can have your seats here this
[8:18] morning I I want you by the help of the
[8:20] Lord for just a few moments today if I
[8:22] could if I would title this today I want
[8:24] to talk to you on this expectations amen
[8:27] lit by the message amen expectations
[8:30] have been lit by the message now I want
[8:33] to maybe just open this morning by
[8:35] making a very uh maybe too very bold and
[8:39] assertive declarations to you that I
[8:41] personally believe from my heart I want
[8:43] to say this this message by this Elijah
[8:46] came for a purpose to put you into an
[8:49] atmosphere of expectation to grip you to
[8:52] move you to elect you to capture you to
[8:55] apprehend you to select you to remind
[8:58] you that you are elected and chosen Amen
[9:00] to be a participant in the resurrection
[9:04] also I want to say this the message came
[9:07] Amen to set you in expectation for what
[9:10] God has promised in his word now the
[9:13] prophet of God would say this he said I
[9:15] tell you what the church needs today is
[9:18] an old time Holy Ghost fire kindled
[9:20] under her he said fire will move the
[9:23] church and nothing else another place
[9:26] speaking of fire he said seeing the
[9:27] Revival fires begin to them he said let
[9:30] us throw on wood of the word that it
[9:33] might Kindle a new fire that our hearts
[9:35] would be full of zeal I I wonder today
[9:38] how many could say Lord that's my desire
[9:41] amen that there would be some wood of
[9:42] your word thrown on the fire in my heart
[9:45] that it would it would be full of zeal
[9:48] again he says what we need is lives lit
[9:51] what we need amen is lives lit a flame
[9:54] with the power and the resurrection of
[9:57] Christ shining forth in the same kind of
[10:00] light that he gave I believe it now you
[10:02] all know this morning that in the Book
[10:04] of Matthew the third chapter we find
[10:06] that John baptized amen with water but
[10:09] Jesus said amen he shall baptize you
[10:12] with the Holy Ghost and with fire so
[10:14] you'll not just be baptized amen with
[10:17] water amen but there was a promise that
[10:20] we would be baptized with the Holy Ghost
[10:22] and with fire in proverb or rather
[10:24] Hebrews 12 Paul would say he says now
[10:27] our God Amen is a consuming fire so
[10:30] there is a direct connection and
[10:33] association between God Amen and fire in
[10:36] Matthew Chapter 5 and verse 14 Jesus
[10:39] says amen that ye are the light of the
[10:42] world how many believes that you are a
[10:44] city that is set on a heel and cannot be
[10:47] hid neither do men light a candle and
[10:49] put it under a bushel but on a
[10:51] Candlestick and it giveth light unto all
[10:54] that are in the house amen so let your
[10:57] light so shine before men that they may
[11:00] see your good works and glorify your
[11:02] father which is in heaven so there is a
[11:05] fire amen that is coming into the
[11:07] believer there is a fire amen that is
[11:10] coming into the church and the reason
[11:12] for this fire amen is to reveal the
[11:14] works of God Amen that our father in
[11:17] Heaven might be glorified now I'm just
[11:19] laying the foundation here brother BR
[11:21] asked a question dear brother Brandon do
[11:23] you believe that the signs should follow
[11:25] all who have the Holy Spirit he said
[11:28] well Jesus said so Mark 16 another part
[11:31] of the question if so then what about
[11:34] the people who believe the message with
[11:36] all that is in them yet they have not
[11:39] these signs are they unbelievers or do
[11:41] they need the Holy Spirit if so please
[11:44] instruct us today on how to receive the
[11:46] Holy Ghost for we believe that you are
[11:48] God's mouthpiece for our day here's his
[11:51] answer you cannot receive the baptism of
[11:54] the Holy Ghost without having an
[11:57] experience when it happens you say you
[11:59] believe every Speck of it when the word
[12:01] is laying in there waiting for the Holy
[12:04] Spirit to put it to work but it takes
[12:07] the lighting of the candle amen the Holy
[12:10] Spirit puts the word to work but it
[12:13] takes the lighting of the candle now
[12:15] here's the candle with the wick in it
[12:17] with all the Tallow everything it has
[12:19] Amen to have in that candle but until
[12:22] the fire comes on it it will not shine
[12:24] any light he said no matter how perfect
[12:27] the candle is how perfect it'll burn
[12:29] everything amen it's got to be Litt and
[12:33] then it burns see and when you believe
[12:35] and are made up of the instructions of
[12:38] what the holy spirit is love and joy and
[12:41] peace and longsuffering goodness amen
[12:43] the fruits that bears it out until that
[12:45] Holy Spirit with a fiery experience
[12:48] comes down amen and lights that candle
[12:52] then you haven't receive the Holy Ghost
[12:54] amen you say well I got the Holy Ghost
[12:56] but I ain't got no fire amen that is in
[12:59] possible because the Lord said that he
[13:02] would baptize the church with Holy Ghost
[13:04] and with fire see you've got to have an
[13:07] experience Amen to have the Holy Ghost I
[13:10] want to say this morning amen that we
[13:12] are not the grandchildren of God Amen we
[13:15] are the children of God Amen not by a
[13:18] handshake not by a Creed amen we are the
[13:21] children of God by a Holy Ghost and Fire
[13:24] experience amen that has led more than
[13:26] just our feet to dance it has led more
[13:29] more than just our tongues to speak it
[13:31] is lit more than our hands to clap but
[13:33] the word has been revealed in this
[13:35] generation and it has lit our soul amen
[13:39] with the knowledge and the authority of
[13:41] the word of God I love what John said he
[13:44] said behold what Manner amen of love
[13:46] hath the father bestowed upon us amen
[13:49] that we should be called the sons of God
[13:52] therefore the world knoweth us not amen
[13:55] because it knew him not see the world
[13:58] didn't know him so if you're expecting
[14:00] the world to know you amen the world is
[14:03] not going to know you amen because they
[14:05] did not know him see the only way then
[14:08] you can be a son a daughter of God
[14:11] because you have to have eternal life
[14:14] and there's only one form of eternal
[14:15] life and that's God's life there's only
[14:18] one form that was God see there to be a
[14:20] Son of God you had to be in him always
[14:24] amen the gene of your life spiritual
[14:26] life tonight amen was in God the father
[14:29] before there was even a molecule and you
[14:32] are nothing but the manifestation of the
[14:35] gene of life amen that was in God as a
[14:38] Son of God now amen you are expressed
[14:42] after his word has come in you to light
[14:45] up this age listen you are the
[14:48] expressing amen God's life in you
[14:51] because you are a son a daughter of God
[14:55] he said you are now made you are sitting
[14:57] in this church tonight because your duty
[14:59] is to express God Amen to this nation
[15:03] and this people another place he said we
[15:05] have become amen from Mortal beings from
[15:08] time beings Amen to Eternal beings when
[15:12] when the word of God lit our souls when
[15:15] the word of God lit our soul amen we
[15:19] become the Sons and Daughters of God
[15:22] Amen with the attributes the gene of God
[15:24] in us Amen to be Sons and Daughters of
[15:27] the father amen God in heaven crying AB
[15:30] Our Father listen friends we are not
[15:33] here amen as church members expressing
[15:36] Church ideas we have come from the mind
[15:39] of God into this age to manifest the
[15:42] life of God listen the denominations
[15:44] cannot do it amen Creeds cannot do it
[15:47] amen it's going to take the Holy Ghost
[15:50] and the fire of God to burn out all the
[15:52] unbelief amen so God can find access in
[15:55] a soul Amen to manifest himself in the
[15:58] way he desires to do it now when you
[16:02] start talking about this word of God
[16:03] lighting the soul amen I looked up this
[16:06] word lit amen it means provided with
[16:08] light amen or lighting it means to be
[16:11] illuminated it means having been ignited
[16:15] amen you've been set on fire and you're
[16:17] burning somebody say well I'm lit and
[16:19] you can't stay awake in church I beg to
[16:21] differ with you amen if you have been
[16:23] lit you have been set on fire amen you
[16:26] have been ignited and you're burning you

[16:49] 30 years amen yes the winds have blown
[16:52] amen yes the rains have fallen but the
[16:54] fire is still burning amen because it's
[16:57] not a church fire it's not a Church's
[16:59] idea it's the Holy Ghost and Fire listen
[17:02] I know there's an unquenchable fire Amen
[17:05] in the pits of hell but I want to say
[17:07] this I believe if there is a negative
[17:09] unquenchable fire amen there's a
[17:11] positive unquenchable fire and I want to
[17:13] tell that devil this morning amen throw

[17:25] she's going to burn when she's well
[17:27] she's going to burn when she good she's
[17:29] going to burn when she's bad because the
[17:32] word of God has lit our
[17:34] souls hallelujah we're more than just on
[17:37] fire with a good idea or a good church
[17:40] program amen we have been
[17:43] ignited by the Holy Ghost I love John

[18:34] Living God let me say well I believe in
[18:36] that message amen there's a lot of
[18:38] people that believe in it but they're
[18:39] not a part of it amen the devils and
[18:41] Hell believe in this message amen but

[18:51] here this morning who don't just believe
[18:53] on this message and they don't just
[18:55] believe in this message they are in this
[18:57] message they are a part of this message
[19:00] by the baptism of the Holy Ghost in fire
[19:02] this message has set their souls on
[19:06] fire we're not just believing in
[19:08] something we're actually in it believing
[19:11] we're actually in it believing see the
[19:14] works that I do shall he do also he said
[19:17] why it's his life it's his Dynamics in
[19:21] his mechanics that's in you that fires
[19:24] off and makes it Go and Do The Works
[19:27] that it's promised to do or my life in
[19:30] him has quickened me by his Spirit to
[19:33] make his word which is the mechanics
[19:36] amen work by his Dynamics listen friends
[19:39] Paul was not wrong when he said the eyes
[19:42] of your understanding would be an
[19:44] enlightened that you may know what is
[19:47] the hope of your calling and what is the
[19:49] riches of the glory of his inheritance
[19:52] in the Saints look at this word
[19:54] enlightened it means to cause something
[19:57] Amen to exist a amen and thus come to
[20:00] light and become clear to all Paul goes
[20:03] on to say in Ephesians 3:8 unto me who
[20:06] am less than the least of All Saints is
[20:08] this Grace given that I should preach
[20:11] among the Gentiles The unsearchable
[20:13] Riches of Christ and to make all men see

[20:20] which from the beginning of the world
[20:22] hasth been hid in God listen it was hid
[20:25] in God listen this mystery that you are
[20:28] beling amen was hid in the same place

[20:37] was not hid in a church it was not hid
[20:39] in a school it was hid in God the same
[20:43] place you was if you ever was a part of
[20:46] God you always was in God listen when
[20:48] you was doping and drinking and running
[20:50] you was a part of God when you were
[20:53] running from God there was a seed in
[20:55] your soul that was a part of the Eternal
[20:58] attributes of of
[20:59] God hallelujah amen y'all forgive me it
[21:02] just hit me amen we've been in God and
[21:05] it's not something we earned it's
[21:07] something that God reveals Paul goes on
[21:10] to say to Timothy amen but is now let me
[21:13] just read it be th 2 Timothy 1:8 be not
[21:16] thou for ashamed of the testimony of Our
[21:18] Lord nor of me his prisoner but be thou
[21:21] partaker of the afflictions of the
[21:23] Gospel amen according to the power of
[21:25] God who ha saved us and called us with a
[21:28] holy calling amen not according to our
[21:31] works but according to his own purpose

[24:33] word of God which he heard of us amen
[24:35] you received it not as the word of men
[24:40] but as it is in truth the word of God
[24:43] which effectually worketh also in you

[25:17] the message you've got to receive it at
[25:20] the same level that it was sent to you
[25:22] in let me say this God did not send this
[25:26] message amen by a lukor prophet Propet
[25:29] he did not send this message amen by a
[25:31] casual church member who decided to
[25:34] become a preacher and to preach the
[25:35] Revelation no he selected this man he
[25:39] called this man he chose this man and he
[25:42] made him as a child in the former the
[25:44] pillar of fire and set his soul on fire
[25:47] with a revelation of Jesus Christ that's
[25:50] why he could preach it when he lost his
[25:52] wife that's why he could preach it when
[25:54] he lost his baby that's why he could
[25:56] preach it when the doors were closed to
[25:58] his face because he was not a lukor lay
[26:01] out of SE casual preacher he was a Son
[26:04] of God who had been lit by the fire of
[26:07] God well let me say this amen God ain't
[26:09] going to send a powerful fiery message
[26:12] Amen to a bunch of lukewarm people he's
[26:14] going to expect the same fire amen that
[26:16] burned in the messenger Amen to burn in
[26:20] the
[26:20] Believers it may be that Millions will
[26:23] hear these words or read them amen but
[26:25] how many will pay heed to them listen
[26:27] that we do do not know but he who will
[26:30] lend his ear and want to know the words
[26:33] of truth amen will find the spirit of
[26:37] God enlightening him if you want to know
[26:41] about your origin hear this message if
[26:44] you want to know about your future hear
[26:47] this message if your ear is open to the
[26:50] word the spirit of God will make the
[26:53] word real to you that is a work of the
[26:56] spirit I can teach you the truth but if
[26:58] you don't open your ear to hear it and
[27:01] your heart to receive it then you won't
[27:03] get the Revelation if you're going to
[27:06] get the Revelation you've got to open
[27:08] your heart to receive it and your ear to
[27:12] hear it I love what the prophet says he
[27:14] said God in every dispensation has sent
[27:17] forth someone Anointed with the Holy
[27:20] Spirit to bring forth his message for
[27:23] that age every time every even from the
[27:26] beginning God was the messenger at the
[27:28] beginning Amen to tell Adam and Eve you
[27:30] shall eat this but you shall not do this
[27:33] see that was the message amen I just
[27:35] want to say this amen it's time to quit
[27:38] being afraid Amen to say what we really
[27:40] believe we believe the
[27:44] message brother said when a man stepped
[27:47] across the message of the hour it
[27:49] brought death and chaos to the whole
[27:51] human race he said now that's how much
[27:54] the message means and remember that it
[27:57] wasn't just a complete blank denial of
[28:00] what God said that he believed it was
[28:03] taking what God Said and whitewashing it
[28:06] over or just misconstruing it a little
[28:09] bit just adding a little bit or taking a
[28:11] little bit away from it let me say this
[28:13] we believe amen that the first church or
[28:17] the original church was established on
[28:19] the day of Pentecost how many believes
[28:21] that brother B said Peter he preached
[28:23] the inauguration sermon at the bot
[28:26] service when the church was born he said
[28:29] the Christian church was born on the day
[28:32] of Pentecost amen let that Revelation
[28:35] settle in your heart that the Christian
[28:38] church amen was born on the day of
[28:40] Pentecost if God is infinite and cannot
[28:43] change then his church must remain as it
[28:46] was in the beginning see The Church Must
[28:49] ever remain the same as it was now watch
[28:52] what he says but man has tinkered with
[28:55] it amen God established it Morgan but
[28:58] man has tinkered with it see they put
[29:01] their own interpretations in it don't
[29:03] you never try to interpret the word of
[29:05] God you say just what it says don't care
[29:08] how it is just line up with it that's
[29:11] all amen don't change the word the Bible
[29:14] said the scripture is not any private
[29:17] interpretation can I just say what he
[29:19] said we have no right to say these
[29:22] things we just got to read it and say
[29:25] exactly like it says and believe at the
[29:27] same way I don't care how ridiculous it
[29:31] seems you believe it anyhow amen I just
[29:34] wanted to I just wanted to know how
[29:36] many's ever heard the word tinker I just
[29:38] wanted to know what does the word tinker
[29:40] mean well here's what it means it means
[29:42] attempt to repair or improve something
[29:45] in a casual or lukewarm way when you
[29:49] Tinker with something you are attempting
[29:51] to repair it or improve it in a casual
[29:54] or a lukor way and it is often to no
[29:57] useful effect it is to attempt to mend
[30:00] something amen by tinkering amen so it's
[30:03] like this you got the fiery message amen
[30:06] but you're trying to you're trying to
[30:07] repair it or you're trying to maneuver
[30:09] it you're trying to you're trying to uh
[30:11] change it amen in a lukor way can I say
[30:14] this to you this message is too hot for
[30:17] lukewarmness this message is too hot for
[30:19] tinkering listen amen I pray to God Amen
[30:23] that we realize this message is the
[30:24] pillar of fire I pray to God that we
[30:27] realize this message listen somebody say
[30:29] well I got some doubts can I tell you
[30:31] something the message is hotter than
[30:32] your doubts brother B said you bring
[30:35] your doubts like a snowball and lay him
[30:37] on the other of God's word and they'll
[30:38] melt away you know why because this
[30:41] message is not ickles amen this message
[30:44] is another a bunch of lukew Amen
[30:46] hybridized nonsense it's the fire of God
[30:49] and it's
[30:51] burning when God sends his message to an
[30:53] age amen that age receives that message
[30:57] and that messenger and that message
[30:59] becomes the leadership of the age
[31:01] remember said see the elect of the age
[31:04] amen follow the leadership of that age
[31:07] notice here that Jesus by the spirit in
[31:10] every age addresses himself to only one
[31:13] person relative to the word for that age
[31:16] only one messenger for each
[31:19] age receives what the spirit has to say
[31:22] to that age and that one messenger is
[31:25] the messenger to the true church he
[31:28] speaks for God by Revelation to the
[31:30] churches both the true and the false he
[31:33] said this message then is broadcast to
[31:36] all but though it is broadcast for all
[31:39] who come within range of the message
[31:41] that message is received individually by
[31:45] only a certain qualified group in a
[31:48] certain way each individual of that
[31:50] group is one who has the ability to hear
[31:54] what the spirit is saying amen by way of
[31:57] this message
[31:58] those who are hearing are not getting
[32:00] their own private interpretation or
[32:03] Revelation nor is it a group am been
[32:06] getting their Collective Revelation but
[32:08] each person is hearing and receiving
[32:12] what the messenger has already received
[32:16] from God you said brother Andrew you're
[32:17] pretty strong on that point of
[32:19] listenting to them tapes you are exactly
[32:21] right amen because them tapes amen have
[32:24] rapturing faith weighing upon them
[32:27] listen I tell you this YouTube don't
[32:29] have it amen and podcast don't have it
[32:31] and CNN don't have it and Fox News don't
[32:34] have it but we have received a fiery
[32:39] message it has the ability to transform
[32:42] you that's why I say listen to it in
[32:44] your cars play it in your home play it
[32:46] on your job play it in your school come
[32:49] on church amen it's time to start
[32:51] listening to the message of the hour you
[32:53] say preacher I don't know how to amen
[32:55] it's real simple just turn on a tape
[32:58] amen well I'm just going to preach for a
[33:00] second if that's okay amen somebody say
[33:02] well our kids are too young to
[33:03] understand that message they're not too
[33:05] young to build computers and they're not
[33:07] too young to hack computers and they're
[33:09] not too young to fix the antivirus when
[33:11] you mess it up so therefore I say
[33:13] they're not too young Amen to hear what
[33:16] the messenger has said to this
[33:19] age I'll say this I believe it's
[33:21] followers of the message of the hour the
[33:23] time has come for us as Believers to
[33:26] remember what We are following Brother
[33:29] Jared what are we following are we just
[33:31] following a bunch of preachers are we
[33:33] just following a bunch of meetings are
[33:35] we following a bunch of services on
[33:36] YouTube are we just following youth C I
[33:39] feel like preaching are we just
[33:40] following conventions I say no sir we
[33:43] are following the pillar of
[33:45] fire I say we are following God's
[33:48] Vindicated message in the age that we're
[33:50] living in that's why Peter said I write
[33:53] unto you both of which I stir up your
[33:56] pure Minds by the way every minut
[33:58] that you may be mindful of The Words
[34:01] which were spoken before by the holy
[34:03] prophets Jesus tells him in Revelation
[34:05] 25 he says remember therefore from
[34:08] whence Thou Art fallen and repent he
[34:11] said God tells him to remember so the
[34:13] origin of the first age was Pentecost he
[34:17] said they had fallen from it they had
[34:19] forgotten the glory and The Wonder of it
[34:21] it was time to go back in mind and then
[34:25] in reality listen somebody can tell you
[34:28] where you fell and you can go back in
[34:30] your mind and say I remember where I
[34:32] fell amen but it's one thing to go in
[34:34] mind it's another thing to go in reality
[34:37] can I say this you will never whip the
[34:39] devil going in your mind to where you
[34:41] fail you will never whip the devil going
[34:44] in your mind to where you quit praying
[34:47] and you quit fasting and you quit going
[34:49] to church and you quit listening to
[34:50] tapes and you quit reading your Bible
[34:53] you will never whip the devil in mind as
[34:55] long as you go there in mind but come on
[34:58] prodical son when you remember you got a
[35:00] father and he is a loving father you
[35:03] don't just have to remember in your mind
[35:06] that you have a father you can get up
[35:08] with your clothes torn you can get up
[35:11] with the smell of the Hogs upon you and
[35:13] you can go back to your father's house
[35:16] go back in mind and then in
[35:20] reality brother said what is the way
[35:22] back the way back is the way of
[35:24] repentance if a sinner has to come to
[35:26] God by the way of repentance then the
[35:28] luk warmer backslider will have to
[35:30] repent that much
[35:34] more repent he said bring forth fruit
[35:37] meat for repentance prove it by your
[35:39] life if thou do not repent said God I
[35:42] will remove your lampstand amen
[35:45] certainly a church in that condition
[35:48] cannot give light to the world because
[35:51] it's a light has turned to Darkness said
[35:55] God will take them away he will take the
[35:57] faith messenger the faithful Shepherds
[35:59] and leave them to themselves listen and
[36:01] they will go on talking about
[36:03] Christianity but they will be barefit of
[36:06] it they will be rather deprived of it so
[36:08] they'll go on talking about a God that
[36:10] can save they'll go on talking about a
[36:12] God that can heal they'll go on talking
[36:14] about a God that can do Miracles but
[36:16] because they have rejected amen the
[36:19] leadership of God they will be bar they
[36:22] will be they will be
[36:25] deprived now let me say this if we know
[36:27] what We are following then we know what
[36:29] we're not following right is that okay
[36:32] Paul or Peter rather says for we have
[36:34] not followed somebody say followed we
[36:37] have not followed cunningly devis fables
[36:39] which we made known unto you the power
[36:41] and coming of our Lord Jesus Christ but
[36:43] were our Witnesses of his majesty I want
[36:46] you to look at this word followed it
[36:48] means to follow out or to follow up it

[37:24] experience and relationship with brother
[37:27] Brandon Amen to build a kingdom for
[37:29] yourself or to pull people to you but
[37:31] you used it to tear down the unbelief
[37:34] that the devil was trying to put in the
[37:36] hearts of the people about the message

[45:55] icicles of Le see we have been lit by
[45:59] the word of God we ought to let the fire
[46:01] of God burn in our
[46:04] homes you say brother you're getting way
[46:07] out there am I really I say Let the Fire
[46:09] of God burn away with the Gloom of
[46:14] Satan the message of the hour has come
[46:17] to light an expectation in our hearts
[46:20] that what we read in this word can be
[46:23] fulfilled in our lives
[46:28] can I say this you don't have to read
[46:30] anymore and say I
[46:32] wish brother Brian you can read it and
[46:34] say it is and it shall be see you say
[46:39] what is that word expectation I I just
[46:41] love the definition of it brother Kyle
[46:43] it's a strong
[46:46] belief Glory it's a strong belief that
[46:49] something will happen or be the case in
[46:52] the future it is a belief that someone
[46:56] will achieve
[46:59] something it is not a
[47:02] week I hope it
[47:04] happens maybe it'll happen maybe it'll
[47:08] come to pass my Bible says that Abraham
[47:11] staggered not at the promise of God
[47:14] through
[47:15] unbelief but was strong in faith giving
[47:19] glory to God now how many is a part of
[47:22] Grace Tabernacle let me see your hand
[47:23] you're a part of the church can I tell
[47:25] you something amen people should not
[47:27] have to come in the church to see what
[47:29] we
[47:30] believe they should be able to see the
[47:33] influence of the word of God on your
[47:35] life out in the city they should be able
[47:37] to see the influence on come on out in
[47:40] the schools or on the job said oh I
[47:42] would to God that you could come under
[47:44] the influence that I live under and my
[47:47] church lives under for we believe that
[47:50] God Is A Healer we believe that God is a
[47:53] savior and we believe that God gives the
[47:57] Holy Spirit can I say something that's
[48:00] more than a quote that is a strong
[48:02] belief in my heart that God Is A
[48:05] Healer that God is a Soul Saver that God
[48:09] is a holy ghost fer see what is
[48:12] happening is sometimes we only get in
[48:15] the element of expectation around the
[48:17] time of a special
[48:19] meeting or come time for Youth Camp or
[48:23] come time for a convention and it's time
[48:25] to get all fired up you know it's time
[48:27] can't wait glory to God am remember can
[48:29] I say this that expectation ought to be
[48:31] here on Wednesday
[48:33] [Applause]
[48:36] night so some ask one time they said but
[48:38] Andrew they said how in the world Amen
[48:40] have you kept on pressing since you were
[48:42] 16 traveling preaching because I have my
[48:44] own

[48:50] Wednesday night you ain't got to do too
[48:51] much well I'm sorry I'm not the guy that
[48:54] says it's just a Wednesday night service
[48:56] and I'll just put a little bit of time
[48:57] in it or just bring some little
[48:59] half-hearted idea that I come up with on
[49:01] the way to church cuz I was too lazy to
[49:03] study listen Wednesday I could be the
[49:05] night that somebody's destination could
[49:07] be changed
[49:10] forever come on Church you say well it's
[49:13] just Wednesday night they asked me to
[49:14] sing a special well you know what I say
[49:16] I say if you're ashamed Amen to let your
[49:19] voice out on a Wednesday night you ought
[49:20] to be singing in the first place it
[49:22] don't matter if it's Wednesday or Sunday
[49:24] or Friday Night of the meeting or
[49:25] Saturday night of the first night we
[49:27] ought to let the fire of God burn in the
[49:31] church let it burn in our Sunday school
[49:33] rooms let it burn in our
[49:36] churches well it's
[49:41] just like a guy got up and said one time
[49:43] said well I can't believe I'm preaching
[49:45] the first night of the meeting I thought
[49:46] dear God I'd hate to see what you'd
[49:47] bring on the Friday
[49:49] night it ain't a talent show it's the
[49:53] house of God I don't care if there's
[49:55] five or 500 I don't care if there 20 or
[49:58] 2,000 I'm going to preach this message
[50:01] like it's the last sermon I'll ever
[50:04] preach you know why cuz I have a strong
[50:07] belief that God is able to change
[50:10] things I have a strong belief Destiny
[50:13] God can change things I have a strong
[50:16] belie I have a strong belief on the
[50:17] Wednesday nights that the Holy Ghost can
[50:20] change that destination of a young girl
[50:22] I have a strong belief that God is able
[50:25] to take a cancer out on the Wednesday
[50:27] night you know why because my soul has
[50:30] been set on fire by the message of the
[50:33] hour it's more than a sermon it's more
[50:36] than an idea it's an expectation of my
[50:40] heart and I refuse to back up to the
[50:43] devil and let him dictate my
[50:45] expectations I'm sorry I'm a
[50:49] Simeon I'm a Simeon brother Mark I don't
[50:52] care how old it is I don't care how old
[50:55] I look I still believe I'm not going to
[50:59] die until I have seen the Lord's Christ
[51:04] you know why brother said he believe
[51:06] that because the Holy Ghost was upon Him
[51:09] brother him said in that great evil day
[51:12] Hallelujah glory to God somebody give
[51:15] him some
[51:17] praise somebody give him some
[51:20] praise somebody give him some worship
[51:23] he's God and His word is true
[51:27] Hallelujah and he's right here this
[51:29] [Applause]
[51:31] morning in that great day of formality
[51:34] and indifference Simeon believed the
[51:37] Holy Ghost so what could happen it could
[51:39] still rest on a man and it was revealed
[51:43] unto him by the holy ghost that he
[51:45] should not see death before he had seen
[51:47] the Lord's Christ and he came by the
[51:50] spirit into the temple Hallelujah said
[51:55] Simeon didn't reason he believed it he
[51:57] said what happened the Holy Spirit found
[51:59] a man to believe the message it's the
[52:03] Holy Spirit today hunting out honest
[52:05] hearts that will believe that message
[52:07] everything in the Bible that was
[52:08] promised is to that believer and when
[52:13] you accept it in its fullness and God
[52:16] knows you'll do it he gives you the
[52:19] abstract to it then the very promise
[52:22] that's made is in your possession and
[52:25] the holy spirit is there to Quicken that
[52:28] to you see Simeon what he was was he was
[52:32] a beautiful picture of expectation in
[52:34] faith said wherever you go whatever you
[52:37] do what you expect brings your faith see
[52:41] Faith knows no defeat somebody say no
[52:43] defeat no defeat faith is perfect Faith
[52:46] brings things when there is no things to
[52:49] be brought Faith creates Faith takes
[52:52] doubt away takes negative and makes it
[52:54] positive see but faith has has got to
[52:57] have a foundation can I say this then
[53:00] the foundation of your faith must be a
[53:03] spiritual Revelation then when the
[53:06] foundation of our faith is on a
[53:08] spiritual Revelation brother Mark we can
[53:11] expect the
[53:15] impossible testing one two is still
[53:17] working we can expect the
[53:23] impossible I feel like saying that again
[53:26] but Bobby we can expect the
[53:31] impossible you say what makes a strong
[53:34] church is a bunch of Believers that
[53:35] expect the
[53:37] impossible you say what brings Miracles
[53:40] is people who expect the impossible come
[53:43] on church I don't expect the possible I
[53:46] expect the
[53:47] impossible well I might as well preach
[53:49] I'm this close to it and God forbid we
[53:52] ever reduce amen the standard of a good
[53:54] meeting down to somebody shouting or
[53:56] dancing in the spirit listen let the
[53:58] music get going good and that's
[54:01] possible well can I preach brother Matt
[54:04] I'm hold I'm home can I preach amen
[54:07] that's where oh God Amen that's possible
[54:10] just get a good hot guitar and a set of
[54:12] drums going unless somebody get Good
[54:13] Feeling Good In the Flesh and they can
[54:15] shout dance but are you making fun of
[54:16] that no I believe in it but I'm talking
[54:19] about this message took us beyond the
[54:21] Pentecostal
[54:23] probability come on Church we're not
[54:26] practic l in
[54:27] Pentecost this ain't Pentecostal
[54:29] probability well the Holy Ghost is going
[54:31] to move GL to God somebody going to get
[54:33] some we know the Holy Ghost is
[54:35] here we know the word has been revealed
[54:39] now it's time to expect the
[54:42] impossible can I tell you something it's
[54:45] time to stop reading that Mr limbs will
[54:47] be restored and start expecting
[54:52] it I felt the devil push against that we
[54:56] respect the impossible look what the
[54:58] Bible said for with God Amen nothing
[55:01] shall be
[55:02] impossible said look here in Mark 9:23
[55:05] Jesus said if thou can't
[55:09] believe if thou can't what believe if
[55:12] thou can't what if thou can't what all
[55:16] things are possible to him that
[55:20] believeth you say all things are
[55:22] possible With God all things are
[55:25] possible to you
[55:29] let the devil oh God let that devil know
[55:33] all things are possible to me because I
[55:37] am a
[55:40] [Applause]
[55:43] believer you said brother are you really
[55:45] saying that I am because God's power to
[55:48] perform the impossible is not coming
[55:51] God's power to perform it is here he
[55:54] said you just take the right man laugh
[55:56] attitude towards any Divine promise and
[55:58] watch it
[56:00] materialize no matter how impossible it
[56:02] looks if God said so he makes it
[56:07] possible another place in order to do
[56:10] the impossible you've got to call on God
[56:12] for power of God to perform the
[56:15] impossible can I read
[56:17] this is that okay everybody okay how
[56:21] many Messiah servants do we have Messiah
[56:24] servants do we have any here
[56:27] if we be the messiah's servants we have
[56:30] to have the messiah's
[56:33] power oh the devil hates that because if
[56:37] you are messiah's servant you have the
[56:42] same power the Messiah had you see when
[56:45] a man or a person has come really in
[56:48] contact with god with that genuine
[56:50] revealed faith that God
[56:54] is there's nothing being no time nowhere
[56:58] can ever separate that man from his
[57:03] God let me say this there are different
[57:05] expectations intellectual and spiritual
[57:08] but intellectual expectations will not
[57:11] produce spiritual
[57:13] manifestations brother said people are
[57:15] expecting the kingdom of God to be
[57:16] different than what it really is they're
[57:17] expecting it to come in splendor they're
[57:18] expecting it to be alive in the Vatican
[57:20] City or some great cathedral but because
[57:23] he brings it amongst a bunch of poor
[57:25] illiterate humble hearted people it
[57:28] blinds the eyes of the wise and prudent
[57:32] can I say this God's original plan was
[57:35] for him to lead man said God can only
[57:38] lead a man as he will let him lead see
[57:41] God can only work with anyone that'll
[57:42] let him work with him now let me say
[57:44] this brother said like this very very
[57:47] very beautiful very straightforward he
[57:49] said God was to be the leader of the
[57:51] people he said now God I'm having to
[57:53] skip over a beautiful study but maybe
[57:55] some other time God was going to
[57:57] humanize the leadership himself in the
[57:59] person of the Lord Jesus Christ but what
[58:02] they done speaking of Israel they got
[58:03] ahead of him because Satan knew the plan
[58:06] of God so he put it in the heart of the
[58:09] people to get ahead of God the word he
[58:12] said now you put the leadership of the
[58:14] Holy Ghost aside all right and the
[58:17] church is nothing but the world with
[58:21] God's name attached to it the minute you
[58:25] lay the influence of the Holy Ghost
[58:28] aside the church is nothing but the
[58:32] world with God's name attached to it can
[58:34] I say this very plainly Church the
[58:37] spirit of God makes the
[58:39] [Applause]
[58:41] difference the spirit of God makes a
[58:44] difference you say what is the
[58:45] difference in that young choir this
[58:47] morning and the Baptist Church down the
[58:49] road the spirit of
[58:51] God you say What's the difference in
[58:54] this church and a denominational Church
[58:56] the spirit of God you say What's the
[58:59] difference in Matt Morris and another
[59:00] Pastor the spirit of God you say What's
[59:03] the difference in our deacons and the
[59:05] deacons in a Baptist Church the spirit
[59:07] of
[59:08] God come on church I say we ought to
[59:11] welcome the spirit of God we all embrace
[59:14] the spirit of God you say preacher I
[59:16] don't believe in the spirit of God well
[59:17] I feel sorry for you because the
[59:19] problemet of God said you better be
[59:21] careful because there is a sin against
[59:24] the spirit in Isaiah 63:10 the Bible
[59:28] says they rebelled and they vexed his
[59:31] holy
[59:33] spirit the minute you Rebel and Vex the
[59:37] Holy Spirit he said therefore he was
[59:40] turned to be their enemy and he fought
[59:43] against
[59:44] them my goodness the
[59:48] minute they
[59:50] rebelled and the minute they Vex the
[59:52] Holy Spirit God turned and become come
[59:56] their
[59:57] enemy the minute they begin to say that
[59:59] part of the message don't apply to
[1:00:03] us the minute they begin to say that's
[1:00:06] just is this
[1:00:08] okay that's just brother brandom's
[1:00:12] opinion the minute they begin to say
[1:00:14] y'all know what it don't really matter
[1:00:17] no more how a boy dresses and a girl
[1:00:19] they rebelled and Vex the Holy Spirit
[1:00:23] look what Matthew 12:31 says we're for I
[1:00:26] say unto you all manner of sin and
[1:00:29] blasphemy shall be forgiven unto man but
[1:00:32] the blasphemy against the Holy Spirit
[1:00:34] shall not be forgiven unto
[1:00:39] Men Let me just stop here and say
[1:00:41] something if it's okay the rain falls on
[1:00:45] the
[1:00:45] just as well as the unjust and just
[1:00:49] because somebody is not meeting your
[1:00:51] standards you better be careful
[1:00:56] what you
[1:00:57] say is that okay you better be careful
[1:01:02] look here but the blasphemy against the
[1:01:04] Holy Ghost shall not be forgiven unto
[1:01:07] man look at this word blasphemy it is
[1:01:10] slander or it is ous and reproachful
[1:01:13] speech which is injurious to Divine
[1:01:20] Majesty did I read that right impious
[1:01:24] and reproachful speech
[1:01:26] injurious to Divine Majesty that's why
[1:01:29] Paul said in Ephesians 4:29 let no
[1:01:33] corrupt communication proceed out of
[1:01:36] your mouth but that which is good to the
[1:01:40] use of edifying that it may Minister
[1:01:44] Grace come on Mom and Daddy you better
[1:01:46] be careful what you're saying when
[1:01:48] church is
[1:01:50] over oh my you better be careful them
[1:01:53] little conversations when you're sitting
[1:01:55] around the dinner table having the
[1:01:56] pastor for lunch you better be careful
[1:02:00] because them babies are going to turn
[1:02:01] into teenagers and they're going to need
[1:02:03] some guidance and you done tore every
[1:02:05] preacher around the country down they
[1:02:08] ain't going to trust none of them I say

[1:05:40] Pentecostal idea out of our mouths and
[1:05:42] our ideas amen that's sitting on the
[1:05:44] music is quenching the spirit that word
[1:05:46] quench means a fire or things on fire to
[1:05:50] be quenched to go out to suppress or to
[1:05:53] stifle
[1:05:56] do you know what quenching is it's when
[1:05:58] you begin to stifle the Divine influence
[1:06:02] of the Holy
[1:06:03] Ghost can I say this the Holy Ghost
[1:06:06] leads a person to believe this word sir
[1:06:09] I'm going to close on this so whatever

[1:06:47] word with the Bible brother Ram says
[1:06:50] God's either going to lead the church
[1:06:52] the Holy Ghost is going to lead it or
[1:06:54] man's going to lead it and if you choose
[1:06:56] man go ahead God pulls his church right
