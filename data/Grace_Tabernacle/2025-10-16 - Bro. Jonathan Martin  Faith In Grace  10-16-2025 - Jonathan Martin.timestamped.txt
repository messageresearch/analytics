[33:01] Let's all stand as we get ready to
[33:03] change the order of the service to
[33:06] Amen. I had this song on my heart. He
[33:07] came looking for me. He came looking for
[33:09] me. Aren't you thankful? So he came
[33:11] looking for you tonight. I was listening
[33:13] to the prophet today and God rich in
[33:15] mercy and he said we were out there dead
[33:16] in sin and he said we deserve to be out
[33:19] there. But he said but God rich in mercy
[33:22] reached out his hand and pulled us from
[33:24] where we were.
[33:25] &gt;&gt; Aren't you thankful for that? Well, one
[33:28] night wild home life raging sea. Oh, it
[33:32] looked as if I would suffer defeat as
[33:37] the blackness of night. Oh, closed off
[33:40] the light. My heart sank with fear.
[33:45] Oh, and my desperate crying
[33:49] out with pride. All I could see was no
[33:54] sight. With faith all but gone, I met
[33:58] the one who came looking for me.
[34:03] Yes, he came looking for me.
[34:08] Oh, he came looking for me.
[34:13] Oh, he made a way. There was no way that
[34:18] I could see.
[34:22] Well, I drifted far. But Jesus was near
[34:26] to rescue my soul and calm all my fear.
[34:31] Now I'm safe from all harm. Cuz I met
[34:34] the one came looking for me.
[34:39] When oh Satan had already picked out my
[34:43] grave. His plan was to fall and put me
[34:47] away. I drifted so far. But anyone care,
[34:53] I soon be lost.
[34:57] Oh, I knew my destruction was a matter
[35:01] of time. But my Jesus appeared. Said,
[35:04] "This child is mine. Now I'm safe from
[35:07] all harm. For he walked through the
[35:10] storm when he came looking for me." I
[35:13] sing it tonight. He came looking for me.
[35:19] He came looking for me.
[35:24] &gt;&gt; Oh, he made a way when there was no way
[35:29] that I could see.
[35:31] [Music]
[35:33] When I drifted far, but Jesus was near
[35:38] my soul.
[35:40] All my fears. Now I'm safe from all
[35:43] harm.
[35:44] I like the Lord
[35:47] for me.
[35:50] Well, now Satan had already picked out
[35:54] my grave. His plan was before me, put me
[35:58] away. I drifted so far. Would anybody
[36:03] care that I'd soon be lost?
[36:08] I just knew my destruction was a matter
[36:11] of time. But Jesus came in and he said,
[36:15] "This one's mine. Now I'm safe from all
[36:18] harm cuz I met the one that came looking
[36:22] for me." How many can say you met him
[36:25] tonight?
[36:27] For me,
[36:30] he came looking for me.
[36:34] Well, he made a way and there was no way
[36:39] that I could see.
[36:43] I drifted so far, but Jesus was here to
[36:48] rescue my soul and calm my fears. Save
[36:52] from all harm. Cuz I met the one that
[36:56] came looking for me.
[36:59] Won't you give the Lord a hand, clap a
[37:01] praise tonight?
[37:03] I said, "I'm safe from all harm because
[37:07] I met the one that came looking for me."
[37:15] I think we have a right to praise God.
[37:17] Amen. If you don't have a right, you
[37:19] sure got a reason. Amen. We got a reason
[37:21] to praise God. How many's got a reason
[37:23] to praise the Lord? Amen. It wasn't just
[37:25] me that went looking for him, but it was
[37:27] him that came looking for me. Amen.
[37:29] Whenever I least expect it, but God
[37:31] showed up. How many's got that kind of
[37:33] testimony?
[37:34] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[37:34] &gt;&gt; I wasn't really looking, but God was
[37:36] looking. Amen. And he found us. He
[37:38] placed us. He called us. He set us aside
[37:41] for his purpose. Amen. And now we come
[37:43] to give back to him. You love the Lord
[37:45] tonight. How many say it's good to be in
[37:47] the house of the Lord? Amen. Somebody
[37:49] turn around and tell somebody say, "It's
[37:51] good to be in the house of the Lord."
[37:53] Amen.
[37:55] Amen. we come to receive something from
[37:57] God and certainly want to welcome

[41:40] tonight? Amen. If you have a need on
[41:42] your heart, just lift your hand to the
[41:44] Lord tonight.
[41:46] Bow our hearts.
[41:49] Most gracious heavenly father, Lord, we
[41:50] come before you, Father God. Lord, we've
[41:53] gathered around your word, Lord. And we
[41:56] know, Father God, that every promise is
[41:58] unto the believer, Lord Jesus. And we
[42:00] stand, Lord God, upon that promise,
[42:02] Lord. You see all the requests that were
[42:04] brought forth, Lord. Father, already
[42:06] being spoken by a son of God, Lord
[42:08] Jesus. So we've know you've heard him,
[42:11] Lord. We've know, God, that you've
[42:12] already gone into action upon their
[42:14] behalf, Lord. So, Father, the greatest
[42:16] thing that we could ask for, Lord, is
[42:18] that you would anoint our brother, Lord
[42:20] God, as he comes forth, Lord God, with a
[42:22] word upon his heart, Lord God, to feed
[42:24] us, Lord. Father God, that our faith,
[42:26] Lord Jesus, would reach high enough,
[42:28] Lord, to please you, Lord. Father,
[42:31] anoint this service and every part of
[42:33] it, God, that you would be pleased to
[42:35] come and dwell with us tonight, Lord.
[42:37] Father God, that we could raise your
[42:39] voice, Lord Jesus Christ. Lord God, that
[42:42] all of heaven, Lord Jesus, Lord God,
[42:45] would say that this is a good service,
[42:47] Lord. Father, we ask you to anoint every
[42:49] minister, Lord, that is here for these
[42:52] services. Lord, we ask it all in the
[42:54] name of the Lord Jesus Christ. Lord God,

[43:04] tonight? Amen. How many's ready to hear
[43:06] the word? Amen. We come been praying.
[43:08] And you know, I I asked the other day,
[43:11] how many's going to fast and pray for
[43:12] the meetings and get ready? There wasn't
[43:14] a lot of hands. I said I should have
[43:15] just said pray and not fast. People
[43:18] don't want to miss out on too many
[43:19] meals. But there was several that fasted
[43:21] and prayed. And but how many's been
[43:22] praying for the meetings? Amen. And
[43:24] praying for God to do something. And now
[43:26] we are in that moment where the Lord can
[43:28] come and speak to us. And you know, and
[43:31] just a few words in the presence of God
[43:33] is enough to change every situation. And
[43:36] anything that's going on or something
[43:38] you have need of, we just want to
[43:39] dedicate this time to the Lord and the
[43:42] receiving of the word of God. How many
[43:43] raise your hand say, "I'll do that."
[43:45] Amen. Just to allow God to come and
[43:47] speak to our hearts. And so we want to
[43:49] get prepared as brother Jonathan would
[43:50] make ready uh to come tonight and just
[43:53] allow God to have uh plenty of time and
[43:56] an open platform to be able to speak
[43:58] what's on his heart. Amen. Well, I
[44:01] sought the Lord
[44:04] and he answered me.
[44:08] He delivered me
[44:12] from every fear.
[44:15] Those who look on him
[44:19] are radian,
[44:22] they'll never be ashamed.
[44:26] Never be ashamed.
[44:29] This poor man cried.
[44:33] And the Lord heard me.
[44:36] Then he saved me from
[44:40] my enemies.
[44:43] For the son of God,
[44:46] he surrounds his saints.
[44:50] He'll deliver them.
[44:53] He'll deliver them.
[44:57] So magnify
[44:59] the Lord with me.

[46:33] conqueror and uh he has destroyed the
[46:36] yolks of the enemy off of our lives. And

[46:41] of our praise, all of our life. And and
[46:44] uh to give him all of the glory and the
[46:46] honor and uh so good to be under the
[46:49] tent. Uh just a tremendous atmosphere

[47:22] giving us the the invite and the
[47:24] opportunity to be here. I've I've got my
[47:26] wife here and my my youngest boy here
[47:29] somewhere. And uh there she is there in
[47:32] the back. And uh and uh so also it's
[47:35] just a real privilege to be able to
[47:37] preach with these wonderful men of God.
[47:39] And I've got just the the uh tre
[47:43] tremendous respect for them and the
[47:45] gifts that God has placed in their life
[47:47] and their ministries and uh just such a

[49:45] aisles and come to every heart. Lord,
[49:48] you're the one that can change
[49:50] situations.
[49:52] And Father, you're the one that through

[50:37] change situations.
[50:40] God, we just ask that you would move,
[50:42] Father. Now hide us beneath your blood
[50:46] in the name of Jesus Christ. Amen. And
[50:50] amen. God richly bless you. If you have
[50:53] your Bibles, we will turn to uh
[50:57] Zechariah the 4th chapter and we'll uh
[51:00] read the first seven verses and then
[51:03] we'll also read from Psalms 110 and uh
[51:07] verse three. And again, we just want to
[51:10] say we appreciate uh Brother Matt and uh
[51:14] for giving us the invite and we love uh
[51:16] we love Brother Matt very much and we
[51:19] appreciate his friendship and his stand
[51:21] for the message of the hour and and uh
[51:24] he's always been just a a real blessing
[51:27] in my life and a real strength and
[51:29] encouragement. And um you know I I I was
[51:33] over in uh uh Pakistan just this last
[51:36] week and uh I I got I I I started
[51:41] getting some text about uh the service
[51:44] where brother Matt had ministered there
[51:46] at the home church and um how that God
[51:50] would just begin to move and just in a
[51:52] sovereign way and and uh you know uh
[51:56] begin to begin to hear about how that
[52:00] God began to pour out the his the power
[52:03] of his spirit and my daughter dancing in
[52:06] the spirit and my wife getting touched
[52:08] and moving in the spirit and you know uh
[52:11] brother Matt my my wife actually just
[52:13] she had told me just a few days ago she
[52:16] says you know ever since that service uh
[52:19] something's been totally different and
[52:21] uh so we thank God for that and we we
[52:25] praise God for for men of God who can be
[52:28] led of the spirit and and can preach the
[52:30] word and and believes in the moving of
[52:33] the Holy Ghost. And my we believe it
[52:35] with all that is within us. And and so
[52:38] Zechariah the 4th chapter beginning at
[52:40] verse one. And the angel that talked
[52:43] with me came again and waked me as a man
[52:47] that is wakened out of his sleep, and
[52:51] said unto me, What seeest thou? And I
[52:54] said, I have looked, and behold, a
[52:56] candlestick all of gold with a bowl upon
[53:00] the top of it, and his seven lamps
[53:02] thereon, and seven pipes to the seven
[53:05] lamps which are upon the top thereof.
[53:08] And two olive trees by it, one upon the
[53:12] right side of the bowl, and the other
[53:14] upon the left side thereof. So I
[53:16] answered and spake to the angel that
[53:19] talked with me, saying, "What are these,
[53:21] my Lord?" Then the angel that talked
[53:24] with me answered and said unto me,
[53:26] "Knowest thou not what these be?" And I
[53:30] said, "No, my Lord." Then he answered
[53:32] and spake unto me, saying, "This is the
[53:36] word of the Lord unto Zerubable, saying,
[53:39] Not by might, nor by power, but by my
[53:43] spirit, saith the Lord of hosts. Who art
[53:46] thou, oh great mountain, before
[53:49] Zerubabel, that thou shalt become a
[53:52] plain, and he shall bring forth the
[53:54] headstone thereof with shoutings,
[53:57] crying, grace, grace unto it. Now also
[54:01] Psalms 110 and verse three. Thy people
[54:05] shall be willing in the day of thy
[54:07] power. In the beauties of holiness from
[54:11] the womb of the morning thou hast the dw
[54:14] of thy youth. Again thy people shall be
[54:18] willing in the day of thy power. Amen.
[54:21] So God just add his blessings to the
[54:23] reading of the word. You may be seated.
[54:26] I would like to speak on faith in grace.
[54:30] Faith in grace. Brother Brandham reading
[54:34] there in Zechariah the 4th chapter and
[54:37] when he come to the sixth verse that
[54:39] this is the word of the Lord unto
[54:41] Zerubable saying not by might nor by
[54:43] power but by my spirit saith the Lord of
[54:47] hosts. The prophet says, "Do you see the
[54:50] message will not come by some great
[54:52] might or powers, but by the spirit of
[54:56] God?"
[54:57] &gt;&gt; Brother Brandham would say in the
[54:59] junction of time that I believe that the
[55:01] church is now standing on the threshold
[55:03] of the greatest vindication of
[55:07] omnipotence that the world has ever
[55:09] known. I believe that we are witnesses
[55:12] of that that we have seen the greatest
[55:14] vindication of omnipotence which
[55:18] omnipotence is all powerful and God has
[55:22] vindicated his presence with omnipotence
[55:25] and it's the greatest vindication of
[55:27] omnipotence that the world has ever
[55:30] known. The move that God is moving
[55:34] through this bride is so far beyond
[55:37] man's thinking, man's intelligence. But
[55:40] this is the Lord's doing and it is
[55:43] marvelous in our sight. Amen. We find
[55:46] that David wrote this in Psalms 118 and
[55:49] then Jesus picked it up and he says,
[55:52] "The stone which the builders refused
[55:54] has become the headstone of the corner.
[55:58] This is the Lord's doing. It is
[56:00] marvelous in our eyes. This is the day
[56:04] which the Lord hath made. We will
[56:06] rejoice and be glad in it. I believe
[56:10] that we are living in that day. This is
[56:13] the day that the Lord hath made and the
[56:16] this is the time that the headstone or
[56:18] the cornerstone has become the
[56:21] headstone. And this is this is not man's
[56:25] doing but this is the Lord's doing and
[56:27] we have seen it and it is marvelous in
[56:30] our eyes. Jesus said that I will come to
[56:34] you and the world will not see me but
[56:37] you will see me and because you see me
[56:40] you will rejoice because this is what
[56:44] God is doing through the church of the
[56:46] living God. It is the Holy Ghost moving
[56:50] in power and in manifestation that the
[56:53] world does not recognize what has taken
[56:55] place but the bride of Jesus Christ sees
[56:58] it and then Jesus said because I live
[57:02] you live also. Amen. So to see it to
[57:06] recognize it there is a manifestation of
[57:09] quickening power to bring life to the
[57:12] sons of the daughters of the living God.
[57:15] I believe that the bride of Christ has
[57:18] been awakened by a message to a
[57:20] realization and understanding that all
[57:24] the saints have longed to see it. Amen.
[57:27] They we have been awakened to something
[57:29] that is so supernatural,
[57:32] so sovereign, so unear. Amen. something
[57:36] that is beyond human efforts and and
[57:40] beyond laws and controls and regulations
[57:44] and dictates of human efforts and so
[57:47] beyond our five senses of of spirit and
[57:51] of flesh. But it has awakened us to
[57:55] something that is so far beyond our
[57:58] human intelligence. Amen. that the human
[58:01] mind cannot even truly fathom what is
[58:05] taking place in this age. Amen. But you
[58:08] see the prophet of God would describe it
[58:11] like this that we have been caught up
[58:13] into the realm of the Lord's thinking.
[58:16] Amen. This is not man's intelligence but
[58:19] this is in the realm of the Lord's
[58:22] thinking. This is not man's day but this
[58:25] is the Lord's day. This is a time of
[58:29] supreme of supreme authority. This is
[58:32] the time where the lion has spoke. This
[58:35] is the time that God has pronounced
[58:38] judgment upon the world. It is a
[58:40] judgment unto condemnation. It is a
[58:43] sentence of damnation. But to the bride
[58:46] of Jesus Christ, it is a supreme
[58:48] authority over every every demonic force
[58:52] of hell that has tried to bind this
[58:54] bride. It is the supreme authority over
[58:58] every spirit of fear, over spirits of
[59:01] discouragement, over spirits that are
[59:03] trying to hold this bride captive. Amen.
[59:07] Forces that would try to hold this bride
[59:10] and tell you the rapture is not for you.
[59:12] But there is a power, there's a force
[59:15] that is moving among this bride that is
[59:18] so far beyond our understanding that all
[59:22] we can say it is the grace of God. It is
[59:26] God coming down and moving not through
[59:30] uh amen not through the dictates of man.
[59:33] It is not through the dos and the don'ts
[59:36] but it is through the supreme power of
[59:40] omnipotent God to break the shackles off
[59:44] of God's people. It is a voice that is
[59:47] went forth in this day that said let my
[59:50] people go. Uh it is a voice of God uh
[59:54] that is standing in the gap uh and
[59:56] interceding upon the people and saying
[59:59] Satan you can't have them. You can't
[1:00:02] hold them any longer. But I have stepped
[1:00:04] in on the scene. Uh it's a vindication
[1:00:07] uh of divine presence. Uh it is a
[1:00:10] vindication uh of omnipotence. Uh the
[1:00:13] power of God uh that says Satan, you
[1:00:16] can't hold my people any longer. I pay
[1:00:20] the price. I've redeemed them. They're
[1:00:23] called out for my name's sake.
[1:00:26] &gt;&gt; You see, there's been a blending of
[1:00:28] dimensions. The Almighty God has moved
[1:00:32] among us and vindicated his presence
[1:00:36] like no other time in the history of the
[1:00:39] world. Amen. It's for a purpose to
[1:00:43] empower a bride. Amen. To manifest
[1:00:47] everything that God prophesied that this
[1:00:50] bride would be. Amen. It's a blending of
[1:00:54] dimensions. Amen. to catch you from one
[1:00:57] realm to a supernatural realm to change
[1:01:01] how we think. Uh I tell you friends, uh
[1:01:04] his presence has come among us to change
[1:01:08] the way we view ourselves. Uh to change
[1:01:11] how we view our families, uh to change
[1:01:14] how we view our failures, uh to change
[1:01:17] how we view trials, uh to change uh how
[1:01:21] we view our humanity. Amen. And it's a
[1:01:24] blending of dimensions. Uh the world
[1:01:27] won't see me, but I'll step in to your
[1:01:30] flesh. Uh it's a blending uh of
[1:01:33] dimensions. Uh where omnipotence uh is
[1:01:36] stepping into boys and girls and moms
[1:01:41] and dads. Uh and you're not looking at
[1:01:44] failures. Uh you're not looking at the
[1:01:46] weakness of flesh. Uh but you're looking
[1:01:48] at the power of the promise. And God is
[1:01:52] here to make good the promise.
[1:01:59] &gt;&gt; We've moved into a faith walk
[1:02:02] &gt;&gt; where God has made believing for the
[1:02:05] supernatural.
[1:02:06] &gt;&gt; Believing for the rapture,
[1:02:08] &gt;&gt; believing for our own body change as
[1:02:12] easy as walking in the promises.
[1:02:14] &gt;&gt; Amen. And we're a promised land people
[1:02:17] where grace has prepared us to walk in
[1:02:20] the supernatural.
[1:02:22] &gt;&gt; Amen. Grace has provided us a pillar of
[1:02:25] fire. Grace has provided us, Amen, with
[1:02:29] an atonement. Grace has provided us with
[1:02:32] a vindicated message. Uh grace uh has
[1:02:36] prepared us uh to step into the realm of
[1:02:40] impossibilities. Uh amen. grace has has
[1:02:44] called has brought us into a walk uh
[1:02:47] amen that we can walk in through the
[1:02:48] promises uh and please God uh where God
[1:02:52] can look upon his children and say I'm
[1:02:54] pleased uh not because of your works uh
[1:02:57] not because of your humanity but you're
[1:03:00] walking uh in the footsteps uh of
[1:03:03] faithful Abraham uh calling those things
[1:03:06] uh that be not as though they already
[1:03:08] are. It's because you've come into a
[1:03:12] different walk,
[1:03:15] &gt;&gt; a promised land, people. You see, the
[1:03:17] token has given us the evidence. It's a
[1:03:20] good land.
[1:03:23] &gt;&gt; Amen. The token has given us an
[1:03:25] evidence. The angels are in the room.
[1:03:28] The Lord Jesus is in the room. The token
[1:03:32] has given us the evidence that our
[1:03:34] theophony is here in this room. The
[1:03:37] token has given us an evidence. Amen.
[1:03:40] That that that that we're hearing from
[1:03:43] our theophony. This message is
[1:03:46] everything you have need of to make the
[1:03:49] body change.
[1:03:51] &gt;&gt; It's your theophony.
[1:03:53] It's the evidence. It's a good land.
[1:03:58] &gt;&gt; You're not born of the natural
[1:03:59] Jerusalem. You're born of the heavenly
[1:04:02] city, New Jerusalem. And the toolken's
[1:04:05] giving you an evidence. It's a prepared
[1:04:08] city and God by grace is preparing you
[1:04:10] for that city.
[1:04:12] &gt;&gt; And it's a character that is fit to
[1:04:14] rule.
[1:04:17] &gt;&gt; You see, it's a good land flowing with
[1:04:20] milk and honey and the benefits of
[1:04:23] Calvary flowing from his bleeding side.
[1:04:26] But you see, the chemistry of the blood
[1:04:29] has already went to the ground. But you
[1:04:31] see that the spirit that was in that
[1:04:34] bloodshell broke and now it's a bleeding
[1:04:37] blood. It's the Holy Ghost that is
[1:04:39] moving into the church of the living
[1:04:42] God. What is it doing? Uh the the
[1:04:45] benefits of Calvary is flowing into the
[1:04:48] church of the living God. Healing is
[1:04:51] flowing. Deliverance is flowing. Joy is
[1:04:55] flowing. Peace is flowing. uh stren your
[1:04:59] children being saved uh and ready for
[1:05:02] the rapture is flowing. Uh revival fires
[1:05:06] uh is flowing. Uh the power of dynamics
[1:05:10] to the mechanics is flowing.
[1:05:15] &gt;&gt; You see the seven thunders of
[1:05:18] revelations 10 has locked the mysteries
[1:05:20] of the entire Bible. The thunder is the
[1:05:24] voice of God. So we have spo we have
[1:05:26] heard not from a man. We have heard from
[1:05:29] the voice of God.
[1:05:31] &gt;&gt; And it's for one purpose, to take the
[1:05:34] seals off of the Bible. Amen. And God
[1:05:37] did it for one purpose. And that is to
[1:05:39] give faith for that rapturing grace for
[1:05:43] the church. Amen. God in this day and
[1:05:46] hour, he vindicated his omnipotence to
[1:05:49] let you know that he is the lamb that
[1:05:52] has been interceding upon the ignorance
[1:05:54] of the people for seven church ages. Uh
[1:05:57] through the dispensation of the son of
[1:05:59] God, uh the holy ghost moving through
[1:06:02] seven church ages. Uh but when the lamb
[1:06:04] took the book uh it was a change of
[1:06:06] dispensation. Uh it went from son of God
[1:06:09] uh to son of man dispensation uh it went
[1:06:12] from just being a church uh to an
[1:06:13] adopted bride. Uh it went from just
[1:06:16] being church uh to Mrs. Jesus Christ.
[1:06:19] And in my name you have power. In my
[1:06:21] name you have supreme authority. It went
[1:06:24] from just being religious but it went to
[1:06:27] a son of man authority. It went to
[1:06:29] dominion. It went to rule over every
[1:06:32] power of darkness uh that would try to
[1:06:35] hold this bride.
[1:06:40] &gt;&gt; Grace,
[1:06:42] &gt;&gt; a change of dispensation
[1:06:44] &gt;&gt; from manage to grace.
[1:06:52] &gt;&gt; I'm building to something.
[1:06:55] You see, we've heard a we've heard and
[1:06:58] received a message of grace
[1:07:02] that ever since the fall, man has been
[1:07:05] waiting to hear what you hear right now.
[1:07:09] &gt;&gt; Adam longed for this day.
[1:07:13] &gt;&gt; Abraham longed to sit in the seat where
[1:07:15] you're sitting.
[1:07:16] &gt;&gt; I know you, the devil tries to tell you
[1:07:18] that you're a nobody, but Abraham would
[1:07:21] like to take your seat.
[1:07:23] Moses would like to sit where you're
[1:07:25] sitting. You young man, you young lady
[1:07:27] that is fighting spirits of depression
[1:07:30] and spirits of confusion and spirits of
[1:07:33] homosexuality and spirits of gross
[1:07:35] darkness. But I tell you, grace put you
[1:07:38] in that seat.
[1:07:40] &gt;&gt; Grace put you where you're at. Abraham
[1:07:43] would like to sit there. Moses would
[1:07:45] like to sit there. Jeremiah would like
[1:07:47] to sit there.
[1:07:50] But let me give you a news flash.
[1:07:52] Jesus longed for this day.
[1:07:56] &gt;&gt; Abraham longed to see Jesus day. But
[1:07:59] Jesus came to die on the cross. That he
[1:08:02] could step into this age.
[1:08:06] &gt;&gt; That he can reveal himself. Amen. That
[1:08:09] everything Adam lost is now given to you
[1:08:12] through the through the abstract title
[1:08:14] deed. Uh the abstract declares uh the
[1:08:17] devil does not have one lean on your
[1:08:19] life. But you were hid in the eternal
[1:08:22] thoughts of God and the devil can never
[1:08:25] get to you. It's grace.
[1:08:30] [Applause]
[1:08:33] &gt;&gt; This message of grace didn't come like a
[1:08:36] TED talk,
[1:08:38] but it came in power and vindication
[1:08:42] &gt;&gt; to con to convince the bride of her
[1:08:44] position.
[1:08:47] The power of God will put the people in
[1:08:50] the bride. The spirit of God, which is
[1:08:53] the word of God, my word is spirit and
[1:08:55] life, will put the bride in her place
[1:08:59] cuz she'll recognize her position in the
[1:09:01] word. Then she's in Christ. Will put her
[1:09:04] in her place.
[1:09:08] I am looking out over this audience,
[1:09:10] this congregation,
[1:09:12] and I am seeing a grace woman.
[1:09:17] &gt;&gt; That may not be dig the right way to say
[1:09:19] that, but that's that's the way I'm
[1:09:21] trying to get it across to you.
[1:09:24] I I I'm I'm seeing
[1:09:27] a lady that the prophet of God would
[1:09:30] say, "Misgrace."
[1:09:33] &gt;&gt; Maybe I can take liberty and say, "Mrs.
[1:09:35] grace.
[1:09:37] &gt;&gt; That's it.
[1:09:38] &gt;&gt; You see, grace is the unmarited favor of
[1:09:42] God.
[1:09:44] &gt;&gt; You can't earn it.
[1:09:47] &gt;&gt; There's not enough perfect works that
[1:09:49] you can do to earn
[1:09:51] &gt;&gt; the the merits of God.
[1:09:53] &gt;&gt; It's simply unmmerited favor.
[1:09:57] You see, Rahab's status was changed from
[1:10:01] prostitute
[1:10:04] &gt;&gt; to a condition, a status change that she
[1:10:08] was no longer considered Rahab the
[1:10:10] harlot.
[1:10:12] &gt;&gt; Grace did that for her.
[1:10:16] &gt;&gt; Tamar found favor to manifest seed.
[1:10:20] Grace did that.
[1:10:23] Sarah who was struggling in her own
[1:10:27] failures and complexes and and could not
[1:10:30] in the sight of the promise. All she
[1:10:32] could see was the weakness of her own
[1:10:36] frail condition.
[1:10:38] &gt;&gt; But grace provided Elohim
[1:10:41] &gt;&gt; and Elohim dealt with her complex
[1:10:44] &gt;&gt; and dealt with her struggles and dealt
[1:10:47] you see Abraham had already had a name
[1:10:49] change.
[1:10:51] It shows us that the seals had already
[1:10:52] been broke. That she had already been
[1:10:55] changed from just the old church to a an
[1:10:58] adopted son and daughter of God, if you
[1:11:00] will.
[1:11:03] &gt;&gt; But she still was struggling seeing
[1:11:05] herself a part of that promise that was
[1:11:08] broke over her life.
[1:11:11] &gt;&gt; But when Elohim came, he didn't deal
[1:11:13] with her
[1:11:14] &gt;&gt; with her own church name. He dealt with
[1:11:17] her
[1:11:18] &gt;&gt; in her name change.
[1:11:21] &gt;&gt; Let me tell you something, friends. You
[1:11:23] may be struggling in your humanity. All
[1:11:26] you can see is your glaring complex. All
[1:11:29] you can see is your own failures and and
[1:11:32] inabilities. But let me tell you, the
[1:11:35] voice of Elohim is still speaking and
[1:11:38] discerning the thoughts and intents that
[1:11:40] is in this heart. And he is here
[1:11:42] vindicating his presence time and time
[1:11:45] again. It's because he's dealing with
[1:11:48] you. He's not dealing with you according
[1:11:50] to your own church name. He's dealing
[1:11:53] with you according to the promise. And
[1:11:55] he says, "You're my bride.
[1:12:01] &gt;&gt; You don't come pride because all of a
[1:12:03] sudden you're being good enough. You're
[1:12:05] bride because of grace.
[1:12:09] &gt;&gt; You're what you are by the grace of God.
[1:12:11] And no human efforts will ever do it.
[1:12:15] No goodness will ever produce it.
[1:12:18] &gt;&gt; But God has sent a message to deal with
[1:12:20] you, Sarah. God has sent a message to
[1:12:23] change your thinking. To change how you
[1:12:25] view your situation. God came and
[1:12:29] vindicated omnipotence. Elohim mechaned
[1:12:32] is here because he wants you to see
[1:12:35] you're a grace woman.
[1:12:37] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:12:39] &gt;&gt; God will not replace you.
[1:12:42] God don't have spare bride.
[1:12:45] &gt;&gt; God don't have spare parts.
[1:12:48] &gt;&gt; God doesn't have spare young people.
[1:12:51] &gt;&gt; He doesn't have a spare mother or a
[1:12:53] spare. Are you understanding? You're it.
[1:12:57] &gt;&gt; So God has sent a he sent a five-fold
[1:13:00] ministry to take this message and keep
[1:13:02] preaching it and preach it and preach it
[1:13:05] and wave the promise and say, "You're
[1:13:08] it. You're a virtuous pride. You're
[1:13:11] justified as if you never sinned in the
[1:13:14] first place.
[1:13:16] &gt;&gt; You're it.
[1:13:19] &gt;&gt; No one's going to take your place in the
[1:13:21] rapture.
[1:13:25] &gt;&gt; Esther was just an orphan girl.
[1:13:28] Positionally placed.
[1:13:30] Positionally placed for such a time as
[1:13:33] this that she could intercede upon the
[1:13:36] for her people. Satan has tried to hire
[1:13:38] breed this bride.
[1:13:40] He's tried to denominate this bride.
[1:13:44] &gt;&gt; He's tried to confuse this bride.
[1:13:47] &gt;&gt; He's tried to box this bride in.
[1:13:50] &gt;&gt; But let me tell you something. The power
[1:13:52] of God will raise this bride out of
[1:13:54] everything.
[1:13:55] &gt;&gt; He's going to raise her out of
[1:13:56] confusion. He's going to raise her out
[1:13:58] of denominationalism. He's going to
[1:14:00] raise her out of every box a preacher
[1:14:02] tries to put this bride in. is because
[1:14:05] the power of God will lift her up, raise
[1:14:08] her up, and he's going to put her in
[1:14:10] glory.
[1:14:11] [Music]
[1:14:14] &gt;&gt; This is not an ecumenical move.
[1:14:16] &gt;&gt; This is a Holy Ghost move.
[1:14:20] &gt;&gt; Amen. This is not an Ahab tied to a
[1:14:22] Jezebel system.
[1:14:24] &gt;&gt; This is not a good man getting t getting
[1:14:27] getting crossed up in some ecumenical
[1:14:30] move.
[1:14:31] &gt;&gt; I tell you, God still got Micaas. He's
[1:14:34] still got men who have heard Elijah's
[1:14:37] message and just because lying spirits,
[1:14:41] enticing spirits have gotten into a
[1:14:43] false ministry and are trying to get the
[1:14:46] people also bowed down uh amen with some
[1:14:49] kind of false religion. But I tell you
[1:14:51] friends, uh I don't care how true it is.
[1:14:53] Uh I don't care how much message it is.
[1:14:56] Uh God will not identify with that
[1:14:58] Jezebel system.
[1:15:01] &gt;&gt; There's no life in it. There's no power
[1:15:04] in it. I don't how I don't care how
[1:15:06] close it looks. I don't care how much
[1:15:08] they shout, how much they dance, how
[1:15:10] much they whatever. There is a ma. There
[1:15:14] is a believer that is not a part of that
[1:15:18] ecumenical move, but saying I'm a part
[1:15:21] of a holy ghost move. I'm a part of a
[1:15:24] vindicated message. And it's separating
[1:15:27] me from all gross darkness that I can
[1:15:30] walk in the light.
[1:15:33] I tell you friends,
[1:15:36] &gt;&gt; well, how are we going to get these
[1:15:38] people to how are we going to get Ahab,
[1:15:43] &gt;&gt; lying spirits coming into the presence
[1:15:44] of God? How are we going to get Ahab to
[1:15:47] believe to do what Elijah said that
[1:15:50] she's going to he's going to do? I'll
[1:15:52] tell you, I don't I don't care how much
[1:15:55] Ahab said, "That's our land."
[1:15:57] &gt;&gt; And he was scripturally correct. The
[1:16:00] prophet of God said Ahab was
[1:16:02] scripturally right.
[1:16:06] &gt;&gt; But that didn't change anything.
[1:16:09] &gt;&gt; God would not bless that Jezebel system.
[1:16:14] &gt;&gt; And I don't care how many ecumenical
[1:16:16] councils
[1:16:18] &gt;&gt; try to get us away from Elijah's
[1:16:20] message.
[1:16:21] &gt;&gt; I declare there's a grace upon this
[1:16:23] bride that she will die out to every
[1:16:26] other voice. She will not surrender her
[1:16:30] life to any other voice but the
[1:16:33] vindicated message of the hour.
[1:16:36] &gt;&gt; I don't care. Let me tell you friends,
[1:16:39] Micaas represents you, the believer.
[1:16:42] &gt;&gt; And believers are standing with this
[1:16:44] message and they're saying this is where
[1:16:47] the move of God is.
[1:16:49] &gt;&gt; This is where the power of God is for my
[1:16:51] family. This is where victory takes
[1:16:53] place in my life.
[1:16:56] Nothing else will work.
[1:17:00] &gt;&gt; I'm trying to uh you forgive me for
[1:17:04] slowing down here and there, but
[1:17:07] &gt;&gt; I'm trying to I'm trying to show you
[1:17:08] grace for a moment.
[1:17:11] &gt;&gt; The prophet of God says, "You say me
[1:17:16] &gt;&gt; are wearing the wedding band of
[1:17:19] predestinated unmmerited grace."
[1:17:22] A wedding base of a wedding band of
[1:17:24] grace unmmerited of your own. God did it
[1:17:27] himself.
[1:17:28] &gt;&gt; He knew you before the foundation of the
[1:17:30] world. So he slipped the wedding band on
[1:17:32] you there. Put your name on the book.
[1:17:36] [Music]
[1:17:37] &gt;&gt; Your very identity is grace.
[1:17:41] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:17:42] &gt;&gt; You're saved by grace.
[1:17:44] &gt;&gt; You were chosen before the foundation of
[1:17:46] the world by grace.
[1:17:48] &gt;&gt; Your whole makeup is grace.
[1:17:51] The Bible says, "While we were yet
[1:17:53] sinners, Christ died for the ungodly.
[1:17:58] &gt;&gt; For our sakes, the wrath of God was
[1:18:01] poured out upon him.
[1:18:04] He Jesus who knew no sin became sin for
[1:18:09] us."
[1:18:10] &gt;&gt; The Bible says he bore our shame. He
[1:18:14] bore our humiliation.
[1:18:17] And he did it for you and I. The prophet
[1:18:20] of God says he paid the debt of your
[1:18:23] high breeding. There it is. What is it
[1:18:26] that you can die to yourself until
[1:18:29] you're no more yourself and be filled
[1:18:32] with his word believing his word and
[1:18:34] then the holy spirit was in him comes
[1:18:37] down to water that word to make it grow.
[1:18:41] &gt;&gt; The prophet again says Jesus the word
[1:18:44] took my place. He become me that a
[1:18:47] sinner that I might become him. the
[1:18:49] word. Let me hold true to it, not the
[1:18:53] church.
[1:18:55] &gt;&gt; See, she's called the elect lady,
[1:18:58] &gt;&gt; which the prophet says elect comes from
[1:19:00] the word elected lady. One lady amongst
[1:19:04] all the other ladies was elected. He
[1:19:08] says just like the virgin Mary was to
[1:19:11] bring forth the body of God on the
[1:19:12] earth, she was an elected woman. God
[1:19:14] chose Mary. Also God has chose an
[1:19:18] elected lady which is his bride.
[1:19:22] &gt;&gt; The prophet of God would say in 62 that
[1:19:25] five stars have aligned. He says it is
[1:19:29] showing God's grace that the power of
[1:19:33] God has beun to fall on an infant bride
[1:19:36] upon the earth. God's power has be to
[1:19:40] fall upon an infant bride upon the
[1:19:43] earth. But you see, it's God declaring
[1:19:47] grace. It's five stars that have aligned
[1:19:51] showing its grace. The power of God has
[1:19:55] begun to fall upon this church. It's
[1:19:58] grace. And it's the power of God that
[1:20:01] has been ripening this bride. Amen. And
[1:20:04] bringing us to a position of power and
[1:20:07] authority is still grace. Amen.
[1:20:11] &gt;&gt; God stepping in to bride form.
[1:20:15] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:20:15] &gt;&gt; The word becoming the word grace. You
[1:20:20] see that spiritual union of Christ and
[1:20:22] his church. Now when the flesh is
[1:20:25] becoming word and the word is becoming
[1:20:27] flesh manifested, vindicated just what
[1:20:32] the Bible said would happen in this day.
[1:20:35] It's happening day by day. You see, the
[1:20:39] prophet would say there's been churches,
[1:20:40] churches. If I could just get the
[1:20:42] monitors here. Uh there's been churches,
[1:20:45] churches. Oh, but there's a real bride
[1:20:49] that is coming on the scene. Amen.
[1:20:51] There's a bride that's got not only
[1:20:53] mechanics, but dynamics as well. There's
[1:20:56] been churches, but there's coming one
[1:20:58] that makes that church live and move in
[1:21:01] the power of his resurrection.
[1:21:05] You see, this bride is under a grace
[1:21:07] covenant. Amen. Christ is God's
[1:21:10] covenant.
[1:21:12] &gt;&gt; It's not if you will, but I already
[1:21:15] have.
[1:21:16] &gt;&gt; Amen. We see there in Revelation the 5th
[1:21:19] chapter, amen, that John wept because no
[1:21:22] man was worthy. Moses was not worthy to
[1:21:25] open the book. Amen. No man, uh, Amen
[1:21:28] was worthy throughout the ages. But then
[1:21:31] we find that there came a message. There
[1:21:34] came a good news uh amen
[1:21:37] weep not for the line of the tribe of
[1:21:40] Judah hath prevailed uh to open the
[1:21:43] seals uh we find there in revelations
[1:21:46] 10:1 that a mighty angel is descending
[1:21:49] putting one foot on land one foot on sea
[1:21:51] open book in his hand and the prophet
[1:21:54] said only Christ it can be
[1:21:58] &gt;&gt; showing that God's covenant is now being
[1:22:02] coming down in the ministry of the son
[1:22:04] of man. And that covenant is coming back
[1:22:07] into full strength.
[1:22:10] &gt;&gt; The covenant, not if you will, I will,
[1:22:14] but a covenant coming back into full
[1:22:17] power and manifestation. Calvary, not
[1:22:21] something that is just a day gone by,
[1:22:24] but Calvary coming back into full
[1:22:26] effect.
[1:22:28] &gt;&gt; The blood of Christ coming back in full
[1:22:31] power.
[1:22:34] Amen.
[1:22:36] &gt;&gt; Satan's doing everything in his power to
[1:22:38] kill the effects of this message
[1:22:41] &gt;&gt; to make the blood ineffective.
[1:22:44] &gt;&gt; To make the word just a cold, powerless,
[1:22:46] ineffective gospel.
[1:22:49] &gt;&gt; That's why we're still in the calling
[1:22:51] out time.
[1:22:53] &gt;&gt; We're the pulling out time. Come out of
[1:22:57] her.
[1:22:58] &gt;&gt; Come out of the confusion.
[1:23:01] Come out of unbelief.
[1:23:03] &gt;&gt; Come out of condemnation.
[1:23:06] &gt;&gt; Get away from those skeptic spirits.
[1:23:09] &gt;&gt; Get away from those cold, lukewarm,
[1:23:12] dead, formal, religious spirits.
[1:23:17] &gt;&gt; Cut loose from the bows that are trying
[1:23:19] to hold you earthbound.
[1:23:23] &gt;&gt; The reason that this message cannot have
[1:23:25] an effect in some of us lives is because
[1:23:28] we've got too many bolts.
[1:23:31] the pull's here, the magnet. And we have
[1:23:35] and we've got what it takes to be
[1:23:37] magnetized. But we've got too many
[1:23:39] earthbound bolts.
[1:23:42] I tell you what we need in this Holy
[1:23:44] Ghost move is the word to discern our
[1:23:47] hearts. And for us to be honest enough
[1:23:49] to say, he's talking to me. I need to
[1:23:52] die out to some things. I need to get
[1:23:54] rid of some habits. I need to get rid of
[1:23:57] some earthbound things that is holding
[1:23:59] me bound in my mind.
[1:24:02] It's time to go up.
[1:24:04] It's time to step into position. It's
[1:24:07] time to believe in the grace that God
[1:24:10] has given this bride in the end time.
[1:24:13] The covenant
[1:24:15] &gt;&gt; is in full effect.
[1:24:18] &gt;&gt; We don't lack for anything, friends,
[1:24:22] &gt;&gt; magnetized
[1:24:24] &gt;&gt; to the headstone.
[1:24:26] The greatest draw that this world has
[1:24:28] ever received is the draw of the power
[1:24:30] of the gospel.
[1:24:32] &gt;&gt; The prophet of God says the moment that
[1:24:34] the that the gospel starts stops
[1:24:36] drawing, I'll stop preaching.
[1:24:40] &gt;&gt; Well, I just want to say the word of God
[1:24:42] is still in full effect.
[1:24:45] &gt;&gt; The word of God still heals.
[1:24:47] &gt;&gt; It still delivers. It still sets the
[1:24:50] captives free. It still breaks
[1:24:52] generational curses, things that you
[1:24:55] that you can trace all the way back to
[1:24:58] generations upon generations. Your great
[1:25:00] great great grandfather and the devil's
[1:25:02] telling you you can't be free from that.
[1:25:03] I just want to say the gospel is in full
[1:25:05] effect.
[1:25:08] &gt;&gt; We heard last night that we're in a
[1:25:09] warfare. And I tell you, this is the
[1:25:12] greatest battle that was ever fought.
[1:25:14] And it's the opening of this word
[1:25:16] putting the gospel in full effect. Is
[1:25:18] where the battle begin to commence.
[1:25:20] Amen. Not in the man age. Uh not when
[1:25:23] just the Holy Ghost uh was moving in the
[1:25:25] church. Uh but it's when the person of
[1:25:27] the Holy Ghost is taking bride form.
[1:25:30] That's when the battle that's when the
[1:25:32] battle rages because now the sword is in
[1:25:36] your hand. The sword is in your mouth.
[1:25:39] And now you have been commissioned to do
[1:25:41] something with it. In my name you shall
[1:25:43] cast out devils.
[1:25:46] &gt;&gt; Speak the word. Why are we crying? Why
[1:25:49] are we belly aching? We've got the
[1:25:51] message of grace. The covenant is in
[1:25:54] full effect. Calvary is in full effect.
[1:25:58] The Holy Ghost is got a blood flowing
[1:26:01] through our life.
[1:26:04] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:26:06] &gt;&gt; Oh, it's still the greatest draw.
[1:26:09] There's a real devil
[1:26:12] &gt;&gt; and we got to recognize him real.
[1:26:16] But as you're recognizing that he's real
[1:26:20] and don't start glorifying him,
[1:26:24] &gt;&gt; don't start praising the devil.
[1:26:28] &gt;&gt; Well, he's so big. He's so mighty. I
[1:26:31] just don't know how I'm going to get
[1:26:33] over I'm going to overcome.
[1:26:35] &gt;&gt; The prophet of God says to overcome, you
[1:26:37] got to recognize him that he's real.
[1:26:40] &gt;&gt; That's the first step. Amen.
[1:26:42] &gt;&gt; But then just a couple of sentence
[1:26:45] sentences later, the prophet of God
[1:26:46] said, "But then you got to re you got to
[1:26:48] recognize
[1:26:49] &gt;&gt; that Jesus Christ has already defeated
[1:26:51] the devil."
[1:26:56] &gt;&gt; So the trials that you're going through,
[1:26:57] they're real.
[1:27:00] &gt;&gt; The situations that look impossible,
[1:27:02] they're real.
[1:27:03] the devil that's hounding your mind and
[1:27:05] bringing up your past mistakes and your
[1:27:07] failures and trying to condemn you and
[1:27:09] trying to take faith out of your life.
[1:27:10] It's a real battle.
[1:27:13] &gt;&gt; But the problem of it is you got to
[1:27:15] start confessing that Jesus Christ has
[1:27:17] already defeated that devil.
[1:27:20] &gt;&gt; He's already whooped pornography.
[1:27:22] &gt;&gt; He's already whooped those complexes.
[1:27:25] He's already destroyed the yolks of sin
[1:27:27] off of every single one of our lives.
[1:27:30] And Calvary is in full effect today.
[1:27:35] What does this message mean to you and
[1:27:36] I? Calvary is in full effect.
[1:27:43] &gt;&gt; Then you've got to say, greater is he
[1:27:46] &gt;&gt; that is in me than he that is in the
[1:27:48] world.
[1:27:49] &gt;&gt; Say it with me. Greater is he
[1:27:51] &gt;&gt; is he
[1:27:52] &gt;&gt; that is in me
[1:27:53] &gt;&gt; than he that is in the world.
[1:27:56] &gt;&gt; That's why the prophet of God, he's
[1:27:57] going to he's going to he's going to
[1:27:59] give us something real real special in
[1:28:00] discernment. he that is in you. He's
[1:28:02] going to tell you how that he spoke a
[1:28:05] blizzard out of existence.
[1:28:08] &gt;&gt; But then he comes to the very last of
[1:28:10] that service and he's preaching,
[1:28:12] "Greater is he that is in you than he
[1:28:13] that's in the world." And then he begins
[1:28:16] to talk about Peter after the day of
[1:28:19] Pentecost and Peter and John is walking
[1:28:21] to the gate beautiful and they see that
[1:28:23] that there's a lame man there and he's
[1:28:25] been there for years and years.
[1:28:28] But Peter, he's over there begging for
[1:28:31] alms. And Peter says, "Silver and gold
[1:28:32] have I none, but such as I have give I
[1:28:35] thee." Now, Brother Brandham says, "What
[1:28:38] did Peter have that was better than
[1:28:40] silver and gold?"
[1:28:42] &gt;&gt; What he had was faith.
[1:28:45] &gt;&gt; So, he released faith to that beggar
[1:28:49] that he could be healed.
[1:28:51] Now I I I just want to say amen that he
[1:28:54] reached out and he grabbed him by the
[1:28:56] hand because the beggar wasn't moving
[1:28:58] and he pulled him to his feet and
[1:29:00] instantly his ankle bones receive
[1:29:02] strength. Now the prophet of God would
[1:29:03] say now such as I have
[1:29:07] &gt;&gt; give I thee.
[1:29:08] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:29:09] &gt;&gt; He says and what I have I give you faith
[1:29:13] for the hour. Amen.
[1:29:16] &gt;&gt; And the prophet in spiritual food and
[1:29:18] due season, he would say, "I want you to
[1:29:21] get built up in the faith of this hour
[1:29:25] &gt;&gt; because it's going to take more faith at
[1:29:28] every in every age. It's going to take
[1:29:30] rapturing faith."
[1:29:32] Hallelujah.
[1:29:34] &gt;&gt; Now I I want you to notice what the
[1:29:36] prophet of God is releasing something
[1:29:38] &gt;&gt; that all throughout the denominational
[1:29:41] ages. They had beat that faith out of
[1:29:44] the church.
[1:29:46] &gt;&gt; They had explained miracles out of the
[1:29:47] church. They explained the supernatural
[1:29:49] out of the church. They they had they
[1:29:51] they had explained God made flesh. They
[1:29:53] had turned the oneness Jesus' name into
[1:29:56] into the trinitarian and all of these
[1:29:59] things. But the prophet of God, he began
[1:30:01] to deal with that church and say, "You
[1:30:03] can't have faith for a headache hardly.
[1:30:05] How are we going to have faith for a
[1:30:06] rapture?"
[1:30:09] &gt;&gt; It's because of those denominational
[1:30:11] spirits.
[1:30:13] &gt;&gt; But when the word became flesh,
[1:30:16] &gt;&gt; it began to rebuke those spirits.
[1:30:19] &gt;&gt; Say, "You preachers have been you you've
[1:30:21] got those you've got the people living a
[1:30:23] million miles below their privileges."
[1:30:26] But he stood in the gap
[1:30:28] &gt;&gt; and he stood there as an intercessor and
[1:30:31] he said, "I'm giving you faith for the
[1:30:33] hour. Believe for all things." God's
[1:30:36] still a miracle worker. God still
[1:30:39] changes situations. God still raises the
[1:30:42] dead. God still saves sons and daughters
[1:30:46] that are bound in drugs, bound in
[1:30:49] alcohol, bound in homosexual spirits.
[1:30:52] The faith of the hour believes in the
[1:30:54] grace of the hour and says, "God, you
[1:30:57] promised
[1:31:00] &gt;&gt; and Calvar's flow comes flowing through
[1:31:04] the moving of the Holy Ghost, moving
[1:31:06] upon the word of the hour.
[1:31:09] &gt;&gt; Manifest the promise in our lives."
[1:31:13] &gt;&gt; You want to see the Holy Ghost move in
[1:31:14] action, believe the word.
[1:31:17] The prophet of God says every time your
[1:31:19] pastor preaches the word, it is a
[1:31:21] conductor for the power of the Holy
[1:31:23] Ghost to begin to flow.
[1:31:24] &gt;&gt; The Holy Ghost is moving upon that word
[1:31:27] and it's releasing faith in your heart.
[1:31:29] You come in a bad mood, you come in and
[1:31:31] with a doubting spirit upon your life,
[1:31:33] but you begin to entertain that word and
[1:31:35] you are entertaining omnipotence. And
[1:31:38] when you begin to say, I believe that
[1:31:39] word is for me. It's the Holy Ghost
[1:31:42] begin to brood over your life and
[1:31:44] saying, "It's for you. is for your
[1:31:46] house. Uh it's for your body change. Uh
[1:31:49] it's for your job. Uh it's for every
[1:31:51] situation. I tell you, believe in the
[1:31:54] grace of God.
[1:31:57] So beyond our thinking, so beyond our
[1:32:00] senses, so beyond human intelligence,
[1:32:03] and yet it's grace that said, I've
[1:32:05] already put the wedding band upon your
[1:32:08] finger before the foundation of the
[1:32:10] world. And if we believe in it, it
[1:32:12] releases the power of almighty God in
[1:32:15] our lives.
[1:32:18] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:32:19] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:32:21] &gt;&gt; The It's a real devil.
[1:32:25] &gt;&gt; But I got some good news.
[1:32:27] &gt;&gt; The lamb prevailed.
[1:32:31] &gt;&gt; He turned and he saw a lamb
[1:32:34] &gt;&gt; as if it had been a battle.
[1:32:37] While we were yet sinners,
[1:32:40] &gt;&gt; while the devil was beating us up,
[1:32:42] saying, "You're not going to make the
[1:32:43] rapture."
[1:32:45] &gt;&gt; But there was the lamb of God
[1:32:48] &gt;&gt; doing battle against that spirit.
[1:32:52] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:32:52] &gt;&gt; The very spirit that is telling you you
[1:32:55] can't be healed.
[1:32:57] &gt;&gt; That lame become bloody because he was
[1:32:59] doing battle with that spirit.
[1:33:02] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. That devil is telling you
[1:33:05] young people that you can't live this
[1:33:07] message
[1:33:09] &gt;&gt; and trying to tell you you're too weak.
[1:33:11] You've got too many faults and mistakes.
[1:33:13] I just I got some good news for you.
[1:33:16] &gt;&gt; My lamb
[1:33:18] &gt;&gt; did battle against that spirit.
[1:33:22] &gt;&gt; That's why he was bloody.
[1:33:25] weary spirits that are trying to grip
[1:33:27] you mamas and telling you you don't have
[1:33:30] what it takes to be the fifth gospel and
[1:33:33] to apply the token over your children
[1:33:35] and cast out spirits when they're trying
[1:33:38] to come against your babies. Amen. That
[1:33:41] I say my God did battle against that
[1:33:45] spirit.
[1:33:50] &gt;&gt; And I say greater is this lamb. Greater
[1:33:54] is this this conquering power that is
[1:33:57] dwelling in this bride.
[1:33:59] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:34:01] &gt;&gt; No foul spirit
[1:34:04] &gt;&gt; trying to beat you up and trying to hold
[1:34:06] you captive and telling you you don't
[1:34:08] have what it takes.
[1:34:09] &gt;&gt; I'll tell you the devil's already been
[1:34:11] stripped of his power.
[1:34:13] &gt;&gt; He's defeated.
[1:34:15] &gt;&gt; We are dealing with a defeated enemy.
[1:34:20] &gt;&gt; Everything's defeated. Can you say that
[1:34:21] with me? Everything's defeated.
[1:34:24] &gt;&gt; Sickness,
[1:34:26] &gt;&gt; death,
[1:34:28] &gt;&gt; hell,
[1:34:29] &gt;&gt; temptations,
[1:34:31] &gt;&gt; struggles of unbelief,
[1:34:34] &gt;&gt; struggles of fear,
[1:34:36] &gt;&gt; spirits that are trying to tell you
[1:34:38] you're not going to make the rapture.
[1:34:40] You're going in the tribulation. Every
[1:34:43] spirit is defeated and it's under your
[1:34:46] feet.
[1:34:49] &gt;&gt; The lamb prevailed to take the book.
[1:34:52] And the lamb stepped. The lamb came with
[1:34:55] pillars of fire
[1:34:56] &gt;&gt; and he put one foot on that Hollywood
[1:34:58] spirit and he put another foot upon that
[1:35:01] political spirit of Rome.
[1:35:05] Every spirit of hell is under the feet
[1:35:08] of this bride because he is the head of
[1:35:11] the body and in the day of his power
[1:35:14] there will be a bride that's willing.
[1:35:18] There will be a bride that's willing. to
[1:35:21] put one foot, another foot, another
[1:35:24] foot, another foot. You're doing battle
[1:35:28] because you've got the abstract title
[1:35:30] deed and you're putting every spirit
[1:35:33] under under your feet and saying,
[1:35:35] "Satan, you have no control of my life
[1:35:38] any longer.
[1:35:41] &gt;&gt; Lust, you can't hold me.
[1:35:44] &gt;&gt; Pride, you can't hold me. Tribulation,
[1:35:48] you can't hold me.
[1:35:52] We are dealing with a conquered enemy.
[1:35:55] [Music]
[1:36:00] &gt;&gt; You say, "Well, how do I possess it?"
[1:36:04] &gt;&gt; Well, you're a promised land people.
[1:36:08] &gt;&gt; You just walk
[1:36:10] &gt;&gt; into it
[1:36:11] &gt;&gt; as an inheritance.
[1:36:16] &gt;&gt; I don't have any money which
[1:36:20] Wish I did for somebody.
[1:36:24] I got a I got a million dollars here for
[1:36:27] you. And I say this is your inheritance.
[1:36:29] I'm leaving it to you. It's a sweaty
[1:36:32] handkerchief.
[1:36:36] I knew exactly what you guys were
[1:36:38] thinking.
[1:36:40] Here, I'll give you something better.
[1:36:43] Oh, well, praise the Lord.
[1:36:49] Uncle Matt,
[1:36:54] &gt;&gt; you do the example.
[1:36:57] &gt;&gt; I'll come to you.
[1:37:01] &gt;&gt; I've got something that's your
[1:37:02] inheritance.
[1:37:03] &gt;&gt; Come on, baby.
[1:37:04] &gt;&gt; But you don't have to beg for it, do
[1:37:06] you?
[1:37:06] &gt;&gt; Come on.
[1:37:07] &gt;&gt; I say it's yours.
[1:37:09] &gt;&gt; What are you going to do about it?
[1:37:10] &gt;&gt; Come and get it.
[1:37:12] &gt;&gt; Come and get it.
[1:37:14] &gt;&gt; It's your inheritance.
[1:37:16] &gt;&gt; You just walk into it. You just walk
[1:37:18] into it. Thank Uncle Matt.
[1:37:29] &gt;&gt; You got more.
[1:37:34] &gt;&gt; It's your inheritance.
[1:37:37] &gt;&gt; That's why Caleb reminded Joshua,
[1:37:41] &gt;&gt; you remember what the prophet said about
[1:37:43] me in my land. Yeah,
[1:37:45] &gt;&gt; that mountain, that's Hebin, that's
[1:37:48] where resurrection power is at.
[1:37:51] &gt;&gt; That's where overcoming grace is at.
[1:37:54] &gt;&gt; And Caleb says, "You remember what the
[1:37:56] prophet said about me in that mountain?"
[1:37:59] &gt;&gt; He said, "I've I've got the strength to
[1:38:01] go and to possess it, and I've got the
[1:38:04] strength to come back."
[1:38:07] &gt;&gt; You know what he did? He stepped into it
[1:38:09] as an inheritance.
[1:38:12] &gt;&gt; Now, there were some giants on that
[1:38:13] land. Come on.
[1:38:15] &gt;&gt; But Caleb wasn't je he wasn't worried.
[1:38:17] He wasn't fearful because he was walking
[1:38:20] by promise.
[1:38:22] &gt;&gt; He knew that there was some there was a
[1:38:25] promise over his life that he couldn't
[1:38:28] die.
[1:38:29] &gt;&gt; Now you tell me. I don't know. I I it
[1:38:33] was Let me just say it like this. I
[1:38:35] believe it was the Holy Ghost that
[1:38:37] brought an inspiration in his heart that
[1:38:39] there is no way that you can die until
[1:38:42] you possess that p that mountain.
[1:38:45] Something was in his heart that lined
[1:38:47] him perfectly up and perfectly in tune
[1:38:50] and he knew that that was his mountain.
[1:38:54] He had the strength and he knew he was
[1:38:56] going to conquer every giant,
[1:38:59] &gt;&gt; every spirit that was laughing and
[1:39:01] scorning and saying he didn't have
[1:39:03] enough to possess that mountain.
[1:39:06] &gt;&gt; But by the promise,
[1:39:08] inspiration was dealing with his heart.
[1:39:11] All he had to do was light himself up
[1:39:16] &gt;&gt; and fire it off.
[1:39:19] I tell you, the prophet of God says that
[1:39:22] he is already conquered for us.
[1:39:28] &gt;&gt; We're dealing with a defeated enemy. He
[1:39:30] has already conquered for us.
[1:39:33] &gt;&gt; But he didn't stop there. He says, "But
[1:39:34] his presence has come down to vindicate
[1:39:38] sir
[1:39:39] &gt;&gt; that he's conquered."
[1:39:42] &gt;&gt; Are are you understanding what I'm
[1:39:43] saying? The vindication of omnipotence
[1:39:47] is a declaration
[1:39:49] that he has conquered.
[1:39:51] &gt;&gt; We're not looking at 2,000 years ago and
[1:39:54] saying, "I wish and I hope and I it's
[1:39:57] too good to be true." But he's here
[1:40:01] &gt;&gt; and he's vindicated
[1:40:03] time and time, thousands upon thousands
[1:40:07] upon thousands. the greatest move of the
[1:40:10] Holy Ghost in the history of the world
[1:40:13] to vindicate his presence that he's
[1:40:16] conquered.
[1:40:17] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:40:19] &gt;&gt; What's the purpose? That you can believe
[1:40:21] in his grace.
[1:40:23] &gt;&gt; It's a grace covenant.
[1:40:25] &gt;&gt; It's already settled.
[1:40:27] &gt;&gt; If Jesus Christ was was here behind this
[1:40:30] desk, he could do no more for you this
[1:40:32] evening than what I could do. Wayne
[1:40:35] Lawson, Andrew, Dave, Brother Matt,
[1:40:39] &gt;&gt; it's done.
[1:40:42] &gt;&gt; I know it's simple, but the devil's
[1:40:45] doing everything in his power to make
[1:40:47] that ineffective.
[1:40:50] &gt;&gt; But all you have to do is step into it
[1:40:52] by inheritance and say, "By his stripes,
[1:40:55] I'm healed."
[1:40:58] &gt;&gt; By the token, I claim my rights. I claim
[1:41:01] my children. Hallelujah.
[1:41:03] &gt;&gt; You see, the prophet of God would go on
[1:41:04] a little bit further and says, "Now, now
[1:41:07] the devil's doomed." He said, "The
[1:41:09] devils, we got we got doomed devils on
[1:41:11] the run."
[1:41:14] &gt;&gt; And then he would tell us, he said, "Now
[1:41:15] the pro the problem with that last
[1:41:17] revival that we had, he says, "Now, are
[1:41:20] are y'all hearing me?"
[1:41:21] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:41:23] &gt;&gt; We had the devil on the run,
[1:41:26] &gt;&gt; but we let up.
[1:41:28] Come on now.
[1:41:30] &gt;&gt; The prophet of God took the open book
[1:41:33] and actually beat the devil so so in
[1:41:36] humiliation that he began to run.
[1:41:40] &gt;&gt; Resist the devil and he'll flee from
[1:41:41] you. We heard that last night.
[1:41:44] &gt;&gt; But the devil but brother Bradom says
[1:41:46] now the problem of that is is we we stop
[1:41:49] chasing the devil. Well, I I just want
[1:41:51] to say something. I'm so fed up with the
[1:41:54] devil.
[1:41:55] I'm so fed up of his lies.
[1:41:58] &gt;&gt; I'm so fed up with him trying to beat up
[1:42:01] the children of God,
[1:42:03] &gt;&gt; bring up their mistakes and complexes
[1:42:05] and fears. I something's just burning up
[1:42:08] in my soul.
[1:42:10] &gt;&gt; I just want to make a vow to God. I I I
[1:42:13] I think I can stand shoulder-to-shoulder
[1:42:15] with these men of God and say in this
[1:42:17] revival, this Holy Ghost move, I will
[1:42:20] not knock down for the devil.
[1:42:25] In this Holy Ghost move, we This message
[1:42:28] has got the devil on the run again. And
[1:42:30] I declare unto you, I stand shouldertosh
[1:42:33] shoulder with this vindicated message.
[1:42:36] And I've got my sword drawn. And I'm
[1:42:39] going to chase this devil. I'm going to
[1:42:41] put him in the tribulation. I'm going to
[1:42:44] I'm going to chop him to bits. I declare
[1:42:47] he cannot hold the children of God
[1:42:49] captive. I declare that he's already
[1:42:52] conquered. Hell is conquered. Death is
[1:42:54] conquered. Fear is conquered. Every
[1:42:57] tormenting spirit of hell is conquered.
[1:43:01] I stand in the breach and declare you're
[1:43:04] free
[1:43:07] in this Holy Ghost move. You are free
[1:43:11] from every voice of man. You're free
[1:43:13] from every doctrine of man. You're free
[1:43:16] from every ecumenical move of man. We
[1:43:20] are free to walk in the Holy Ghost.
[1:43:26] &gt;&gt; Every promise of God is true.
[1:43:29] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:43:33] &gt;&gt; Now, the prophet of God would tell us
[1:43:36] that he'll weep with those who weep.
[1:43:38] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[1:43:41] &gt;&gt; If you want to weep, he'll weep with
[1:43:42] you.
[1:43:44] &gt;&gt; And sometimes we feel like weeping,
[1:43:45] don't we?
[1:43:47] Sometimes we go through hard times and
[1:43:50] struggles and we don't know what it's
[1:43:51] about.
[1:43:54] &gt;&gt; We get a poor as me spirit on us. And do
[1:43:58] you realize even that thing's conquered?
[1:44:04] &gt;&gt; But I tell you, the prophet of God gave
[1:44:06] us a secret.
[1:44:08] He says he'll weep with those who weep,
[1:44:11] but he'll be in victory
[1:44:13] &gt;&gt; with those who are victory.
[1:44:16] And then the prophet of God stopped and
[1:44:18] he says, "Now, let's keep him in
[1:44:20] victory."
[1:44:24] &gt;&gt; I know sometimes it makes us feel good
[1:44:27] to give our our our our wife a soba
[1:44:30] story and
[1:44:34] oh, I'm talking to our humanity. I know.
[1:44:36] I know I am.
[1:44:37] &gt;&gt; And our wife starts giving the husbands
[1:44:40] a sob story and before you know it, you
[1:44:42] got a spirit of doom and gloom all in
[1:44:43] the house.
[1:44:46] Now, now if that's the way you want our
[1:44:48] conqueror,
[1:44:52] &gt;&gt; but the prophet of God says we can keep
[1:44:54] him in victory.
[1:44:56] &gt;&gt; I think we should all take a vow and say
[1:44:59] there is something so supernatural
[1:45:01] moving. This is a 20 in 2025. This is a
[1:45:04] supernatural season.
[1:45:06] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:45:07] Everything that has been laying in that
[1:45:09] message that has been ripening our life
[1:45:12] and ripening our faith. I just want to
[1:45:14] declare there is a mature bride upon
[1:45:15] this earth.
[1:45:16] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:45:18] &gt;&gt; There is a bride that is so perfectly in
[1:45:20] tune with this Holy Ghost and this word.
[1:45:23] It is positionally placing her in that
[1:45:25] inheritance and she is looking at that
[1:45:27] and says, "Why would I just sit here and
[1:45:32] die? Why would I sit here in my own
[1:45:36] self-pity
[1:45:37] &gt;&gt; when I can walk into my inheritance?
[1:45:40] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:45:40] &gt;&gt; And I can tow the line with the devil
[1:45:43] &gt;&gt; and I can whack that thing and whack it.
[1:45:46] And if it don't move, I whack it again.
[1:45:49] &gt;&gt; And if it don't move, I whack it again.
[1:45:52] And I'm going to whack it. And I'm going
[1:45:53] to speak and I'm going to speak. And I'm
[1:45:56] going to speak. And I know that mountain
[1:45:59] is moving. I know that there is such a
[1:46:02] move of the Holy Ghost that he's moving
[1:46:05] obstacles out of my life. He's changing
[1:46:08] family situations. He's restoring
[1:46:11] marriages. He's restoring family
[1:46:14] structures. It is the power of
[1:46:17] omnipotence in 2025
[1:46:20] that is bringing a message of adoption
[1:46:23] into the church of the living God.
[1:46:25] Hallelujah.
[1:46:27] &gt;&gt; The pastor is not here to fight your
[1:46:30] battles.
[1:46:31] &gt;&gt; The pastor is here to wave this promise
[1:46:34] over your life.
[1:46:36] &gt;&gt; The Holy Ghost is moving on that
[1:46:38] conductor right into your heart. And
[1:46:40] something's saying yes to the word.
[1:46:43] &gt;&gt; I know things look impossible, but
[1:46:46] something's saying yes to the word.
[1:46:48] &gt;&gt; Well, there's a yes and someone else
[1:46:50] says yes. And some brother brother says
[1:46:53] it's a power. It's a power of agreement
[1:46:55] with the word. And all of the sudden,
[1:46:57] you've got the power of omnipotence
[1:47:00] moving among the bride. All because
[1:47:02] there is a union in agreement
[1:47:05] &gt;&gt; with the word.
[1:47:09] &gt;&gt; Now, I I'm trying to close.
[1:47:12] &gt;&gt; I'm bringing it to this point right here
[1:47:14] because as much as your faith will be
[1:47:16] released, that's how much power you can
[1:47:18] have.
[1:47:20] &gt;&gt; You see, it's God and Morphe. It was God
[1:47:22] and Morphe and the prophets. It was God
[1:47:24] and Morphe in his word. It's God and
[1:47:27] morphe in every.
[1:47:30] &gt;&gt; But you see the prophet of God says that
[1:47:32] it was when the word comes to those
[1:47:34] prophets, they were called gods.
[1:47:37] &gt;&gt; The prophet says says the same thing is
[1:47:39] today. It's God manifested in flesh. The
[1:47:42] message of the hour, the light of the
[1:47:45] day.
[1:47:46] &gt;&gt; Amen. And immediately the prophet of God
[1:47:49] says that's the greatest indep.
[1:47:56] &gt;&gt; The message of the hour is ye are God's.
[1:48:01] Amen.
[1:48:02] &gt;&gt; Come on.
[1:48:05] &gt;&gt; The message, the light is this word made
[1:48:10] flesh
[1:48:11] &gt;&gt; in bright form
[1:48:14] &gt;&gt; is the light of the day. And to point to
[1:48:17] anything back there is the greatest
[1:48:20] indebtment there is
[1:48:23] &gt;&gt; because you'll wreck up somewhere
[1:48:24] because you're looking at a false glare.
[1:48:28] Come on.
[1:48:29] &gt;&gt; To let your complexes
[1:48:31] rob you of who you are as a son and
[1:48:35] daughter of God is an indep.
[1:48:40] &gt;&gt; To allow a preacher
[1:48:42] &gt;&gt; to not get caught up with the message of
[1:48:44] the hour and and declare it's God in
[1:48:47] flesh.
[1:48:48] &gt;&gt; It's God and boys, God and girls. It's
[1:48:51] the moving of the Holy Ghost making the
[1:48:54] word live in human flesh in this last
[1:48:56] days.
[1:48:58] &gt;&gt; It's the greatest indebtman.
[1:49:03] &gt;&gt; You know, the prophet of God would say
[1:49:07] that they're trying to limit the church
[1:49:09] by looking at a at a false glare.
[1:49:14] &gt;&gt; You see, they put traditional barriers
[1:49:16] over the church.
[1:49:18] traditional barriers that well Jesus is
[1:49:21] the same way back there but he's not the
[1:49:22] same today. It's a traditional barrier
[1:49:26] &gt;&gt; and it's limiting the faith
[1:49:28] &gt;&gt; of the son of God in the church.
[1:49:31] &gt;&gt; But the prophet of God says now if you
[1:49:33] can just break past that traditional
[1:49:36] barrier
[1:49:37] &gt;&gt; if you can just break free of your own
[1:49:41] sound barrier. Now, we heard it last
[1:49:43] night because brother Andrew said what
[1:49:46] it is, it's reasoning.
[1:49:48] &gt;&gt; And your own human intellects begins to
[1:49:51] reason with the word and trying to put
[1:49:53] limits on your faith.
[1:49:55] &gt;&gt; And trying to trying to tell you that
[1:49:57] you, oh, you can only believe for that
[1:49:58] and you can only believe for that so
[1:49:59] far. And but you've got to break past
[1:50:02] your own humanity.
[1:50:04] &gt;&gt; You've got to look in the mirror of this
[1:50:06] word and come to an identification and
[1:50:08] say, "I am Mrs. Grace.
[1:50:12] There is something moving in my life
[1:50:14] that is it it's it's it's it's
[1:50:16] so beyond my my my humanity. It's so
[1:50:20] beyond my own human thinking. All I can
[1:50:22] say is there's an inspiration that is
[1:50:24] bringing me in tune with this word. I
[1:50:25] believe it's for me.
[1:50:28] &gt;&gt; It it's something that is causing me to
[1:50:30] rise up and say I am everything this
[1:50:33] word says that I am.
[1:50:35] &gt;&gt; And you begin to speak the word those
[1:50:38] blast words over your life. Thus saith
[1:50:40] the Lord.
[1:50:43] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:50:44] &gt;&gt; I read something in the message of grace
[1:50:46] and if you haven't if you haven't went
[1:50:47] through that message start from the
[1:50:48] beginning and go go through it. The
[1:50:51] prophet of God gives some different
[1:50:53] different experiences and I'm not going
[1:50:55] to go through it but he says that he
[1:50:58] brought he says that just a year before
[1:51:00] he spoke those squirrels into existence.
[1:51:05] He said, ' And something just drew him
[1:51:07] to that same tree as he was hunting. He
[1:51:09] was hunting.
[1:51:11] He said, 'I went over there to that tree
[1:51:13] and I'm just thinking, you know, this is
[1:51:14] where, he said, this is where it
[1:51:16] happened a year ago. He said, all of a
[1:51:19] sudden, God just began to speak to his
[1:51:21] heart. And he said, now what do you need
[1:51:25] now?
[1:51:26] Now, I want to take you back to when the
[1:51:29] first time it happened. Now, the prophet
[1:51:31] of God was wondering, who am I talking
[1:51:33] to?
[1:51:34] what is this all what's taking place?
[1:51:36] And and and and remember he said there's
[1:51:39] going to be a squirrel there here and
[1:51:40] it's going to go over there and and then
[1:51:42] he got excited and he even shot before
[1:51:44] it went over there and he missed it.
[1:51:48] But now the prophet of God is so sure of
[1:51:51] who's doing the talking
[1:51:53] &gt;&gt; that he says I'm going to get a mess of
[1:51:55] squirrels.
[1:51:57] He says, "I I I spoke." I said, "You
[1:52:00] know," he says, "there was there there
[1:52:01] there was uh mosquitoes everywhere." He
[1:52:04] said, "I not one of those are going to
[1:52:06] bother me again."
[1:52:08] And he and he said it was raining. He
[1:52:10] says, "The sun's going to shine in 30
[1:52:11] minutes." All those things happened.
[1:52:14] He said, "Behind me, I heard something
[1:52:17] and I turned around." When I did, he
[1:52:19] says, "About 70 yards away, there was a
[1:52:22] red squirrel."
[1:52:24] Brother Brandham is so sure of what has
[1:52:27] taken place.
[1:52:28] &gt;&gt; He said, "I just turned around." He
[1:52:29] said, "I put my gun up." He says, "And
[1:52:31] that high-powered scope." He said, "I
[1:52:33] could even barely even see the
[1:52:35] squirrel."
[1:52:36] He said, "But all I did is I just put it
[1:52:39] in the vicinity. I just pointed the
[1:52:41] vicinity and I just put it up above the
[1:52:42] squirrel and I pulled the trigger."
[1:52:45] He said, "And when I pulled the
[1:52:47] trigger," he said, "the bullet went
[1:52:49] right to the eye. Thank you, Lord.
[1:52:52] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:52:54] &gt;&gt; I don't know how that prophet
[1:52:58] &gt;&gt; reasoned everything out and knew that he
[1:53:01] was just going to simply point it in
[1:53:02] that direction and pull the trigger and
[1:53:04] he wasn't going to miss it. But he was
[1:53:07] so confident.
[1:53:09] &gt;&gt; There was an inspiration that was upon
[1:53:11] his life
[1:53:13] &gt;&gt; that he knew that that was his squirrel.
[1:53:16] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:53:17] &gt;&gt; And all he had to do is just point it in
[1:53:19] the direction. just lift it up and pull
[1:53:21] the trigger and he hit it in the eye.
[1:53:24] &gt;&gt; All of the sudden, you know what? My
[1:53:26] mind went to another time in the Bible
[1:53:30] that David had come among his brethren.
[1:53:34] &gt;&gt; His brethren were all cowarded down.
[1:53:38] &gt;&gt; And David said, "Why are you guys
[1:53:39] cowered down for?"
[1:53:41] &gt;&gt; He says, "Well, there is a there is a a
[1:53:44] giant over there
[1:53:46] &gt;&gt; and he's challenging Saul's army. Yeah.
[1:53:50] &gt;&gt; And about that time did a Goliath stood
[1:53:55] up and he said, "I challenge the armies
[1:53:58] of Saul.
[1:53:59] &gt;&gt; I challenge the armies of Israel." And
[1:54:02] David heard that and said, "Who's the
[1:54:04] armies of Saul?"
[1:54:05] &gt;&gt; He said, "We're not the armies of Saul.
[1:54:07] We're the armies of the living God."
[1:54:11] &gt;&gt; You see, David David had a pulsation
[1:54:14] within his soul because he knew that he
[1:54:16] was anointed. Hallelujah.
[1:54:18] &gt;&gt; He knew that he was a part of a Holy
[1:54:21] Ghost move.
[1:54:24] &gt;&gt; And David is looking at these at his
[1:54:26] brethren all cowered down and he hears
[1:54:28] the challenge of Goliath and something
[1:54:30] bubbles up in his soul and says, "I'll
[1:54:33] meet that challenge."
[1:54:36] &gt;&gt; The prophet of God says David was so uh
[1:54:40] so anointed of the Holy Ghost that David
[1:54:43] started dancing.
[1:54:45] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:54:47] David started dancing all the way to the
[1:54:50] brook.
[1:54:52] &gt;&gt; He got five stones and he's dancing.
[1:54:57] &gt;&gt; It's because the prophet said by faith,
[1:55:01] David knew that he was dealing with a
[1:55:04] defeated enemy.
[1:55:06] [Applause]
[1:55:09] &gt;&gt; David knew there was no uncircumcised
[1:55:11] Philistine that could stand before a son
[1:55:13] of God. So David by faith already looked
[1:55:17] ahead and he saw that giant falling at
[1:55:19] his feet. He already saw himself drawing
[1:55:22] the sword. He saw himself cutting his
[1:55:25] head off.
[1:55:29] &gt;&gt; So he's dancing and the Holy Ghost
[1:55:31] moving. Everyone else has cowed down and
[1:55:34] peeking and said, "Oh my, this is not
[1:55:36] going to end good." And what is that
[1:55:38] holy roller doing? He's a fanatic.
[1:55:42] &gt;&gt; He's embarrassing us.
[1:55:45] Hallelujah.
[1:55:46] &gt;&gt; David dances all the way to the very t
[1:55:49] the very just just just uh ju in the
[1:55:52] presence of Goliath there and he hears
[1:55:54] Goliath make those boast
[1:55:58] &gt;&gt; and something in David says you're going
[1:56:00] to be like one of those sheep or one of
[1:56:03] those lions. You're going to be like
[1:56:04] that lion and that bear.
[1:56:06] &gt;&gt; He spoke it.
[1:56:09] &gt;&gt; The prophet of God says he wasn't
[1:56:11] crying.
[1:56:14] David didn't need an all night prayer
[1:56:16] meeting
[1:56:17] &gt;&gt; to get anointed
[1:56:19] &gt;&gt; because God had him prayed up before the
[1:56:22] foundation of the world.
[1:56:25] &gt;&gt; I'm telling you friends, we're in a
[1:56:27] different season.
[1:56:30] &gt;&gt; We're under a different atmosphere.
[1:56:32] We're in the presence of the capstone
[1:56:35] coming down upon the bride. This is the
[1:56:38] power of omnipotence.
[1:56:41] [Applause]
[1:56:43] This is the day that the people are
[1:56:45] willing to be some David's.
[1:56:49] &gt;&gt; David just put that just still dancing
[1:56:51] away.
[1:56:52] &gt;&gt; Put that stone in there. There was only
[1:56:54] one little spot on his forehead.
[1:56:57] &gt;&gt; He didn't even have to aim.
[1:57:01] &gt;&gt; He just got that. He He was inspired.
[1:57:04] &gt;&gt; He knew he couldn't lose.
[1:57:06] &gt;&gt; He knew he couldn't go. Are Are you with
[1:57:07] me? I'm going to I'm going to deal with
[1:57:09] it. He knew he couldn't go in the
[1:57:11] tribulation.
[1:57:13] &gt;&gt; He didn't know how his children are
[1:57:14] going to be saved. But he knew he just
[1:57:16] had to speak the word.
[1:57:18] &gt;&gt; He didn't know how he was going to be
[1:57:19] delivered from cancer. He didn't know he
[1:57:21] didn't know how he was going to be
[1:57:22] delivered from pornography. He didn't
[1:57:24] know how his marriage was going to be
[1:57:26] healed. All he had to do is speak the
[1:57:28] word. He didn't have to add it up. He
[1:57:31] didn't have to make all the quotes fit.
[1:57:33] He didn't have to get with this pastor
[1:57:35] and this preacher and make it get an
[1:57:37] ecumenical council together and make
[1:57:39] sure that he's in the will of God. All
[1:57:41] he knew is his faith was lining up with
[1:57:45] the vindication of omnipotence.
[1:57:54] And all the sudden the dynamics got to
[1:57:57] the mechanics
[1:57:59] &gt;&gt; and begin to supersonic speed a million
[1:58:02] miles an hour and got a hold of that
[1:58:05] rock and hit the only spot that he can
[1:58:07] get the kill zone.
[1:58:13] Oh, I can hear a prophet saying, "God is
[1:58:16] raising up another generation for the
[1:58:18] last great kill. There's a kill zone."
[1:58:22] And the Holy Ghost knows where the kill
[1:58:24] zone is. You don't have to do it. It's
[1:58:27] not by might. It's not by power. It's by
[1:58:31] my spirit, saith the Lord.
[1:58:34] Speak.
[1:58:36] Speak the word. Why cry? Confess the
[1:58:40] promise. Get that rock in your mouth and
[1:58:43] confess that promise and see the Holy
[1:58:46] Ghost get a hold of it.
[1:58:53] &gt;&gt; Break that traditional barrier.
[1:58:55] &gt;&gt; Well, I don't know.
[1:58:57] &gt;&gt; This is the way I've always done it.
[1:58:59] Break that traditional barrier.
[1:59:02] &gt;&gt; Well, this is the way so and so preaches
[1:59:04] the message. Come on.
[1:59:07] &gt;&gt; I may have great respect for brother so
[1:59:09] and so, but this ain't his message.
[1:59:17] &gt;&gt; This ain't brother so and so time. This
[1:59:19] is bride time.
[1:59:21] &gt;&gt; This is bride age.
[1:59:23] &gt;&gt; This is eagle age.
[1:59:25] &gt;&gt; This is flying eagle age.
[1:59:28] &gt;&gt; This is word age. Astronaut age. Rapture
[1:59:32] age. Are you getting it? Speak the word.
[1:59:36] It's your time.
[1:59:37] [Applause]
[1:59:39] Quit backing up for the devil. Pull the
[1:59:42] trigger.
[1:59:43] &gt;&gt; Get the gun off of the shelf and pull
[1:59:46] the trigger.
[1:59:48] &gt;&gt; Well, I'm not trained.
[1:59:50] &gt;&gt; Who said you had to be?
[1:59:53] &gt;&gt; Pull the trigger.
[1:59:55] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[1:59:55] &gt;&gt; You may not know the ABCs of the message
[1:59:57] hardly. Pull the trigger. Anyways,
[2:00:01] &gt;&gt; God's not looking for scholars. He's
[2:00:03] looking for someone that'll believe in
[2:00:05] his grace.
[2:00:07] &gt;&gt; Someone that can put the word in action.
[2:00:11] &gt;&gt; If it be a 5-year-old, an 8year-old,
[2:00:14] 10year-old, or an 80y old, it doesn't
[2:00:16] matter.
[2:00:17] &gt;&gt; There's a generation upon the earth
[2:00:20] right now that takes God at his word and
[2:00:23] isn't ashamed to pull the trigger. I'm
[2:00:26] not ashamed of the power of God.
[2:00:28] &gt;&gt; For it's my deliverance.
[2:00:32] &gt;&gt; I'm closing.
[2:00:35] &gt;&gt; It's the message of grace.
[2:00:38] &gt;&gt; Well, what if I miss? You can't miss.
[2:00:42] &gt;&gt; Come on.
[2:00:42] &gt;&gt; Are you hearing me?
[2:00:44] &gt;&gt; You can't miss. Hallelujah.
[2:00:48] &gt;&gt; But just in case you're having a hard
[2:00:49] time with what I'm trying to tell you,
[2:00:52] the prophet of God was a very nervous
[2:00:55] man.
[2:00:56] And he was he was nervous about getting
[2:00:58] this message wrong.
[2:01:00] &gt;&gt; He wanted to make sure that he was
[2:01:01] hitting right what Paul preached.
[2:01:05] &gt;&gt; So God put him in an experience where he
[2:01:08] hit he he he shot his he shot his rifle
[2:01:10] and he hit the same hole nine times.
[2:01:12] Nine times.
[2:01:13] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[2:01:14] And then his gun got all out of whack.
[2:01:16] He missed the target. He couldn't. We
[2:01:18] all know the story.
[2:01:20] &gt;&gt; And the prophet of God says now that God
[2:01:22] spoke to him said, "The way I made you
[2:01:24] is thus because you want to be right on
[2:01:28] every time."
[2:01:30] &gt;&gt; You know that if Paul hit the mark
[2:01:33] &gt;&gt; and you're preaching what Paul preached,
[2:01:35] you'll hit the mark.
[2:01:36] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:01:37] &gt;&gt; If you're just preaching what Peter
[2:01:39] preached, you'll hit the mark. Well, I I
[2:01:41] just want to let you know, stay with the
[2:01:43] word.
[2:01:44] &gt;&gt; Stay with the message.
[2:01:46] &gt;&gt; And you can't miss.
[2:01:51] &gt;&gt; But while you've got it all lined up,
[2:01:57] &gt;&gt; the message has already got it all lined
[2:01:59] up
[2:02:01] &gt;&gt; and you're still sitting there wondering
[2:02:03] if it's for you,
[2:02:05] &gt;&gt; and the devil's beating you up.
[2:02:07] &gt;&gt; And the devil's got a complex. and the
[2:02:10] devil's trying to get you to be one of
[2:02:11] David's brethren hiding behind the
[2:02:12] rocks. I just want to let you know if
[2:02:14] there's an inspiration that ever strikes
[2:02:15] your heart that if you'll just take this
[2:02:19] this word
[2:02:22] &gt;&gt; and just
[2:02:29] &gt;&gt; it'll hit it.
[2:02:31] &gt;&gt; And it not ain't going it ain't going to
[2:02:33] just hit the squirrel.
[2:02:34] &gt;&gt; It's going to hit in the eye. Amen.
[2:02:37] &gt;&gt; It's going to hit it exactly where it
[2:02:39] needs to hit.
[2:02:40] &gt;&gt; Young people, shoot the gun.
[2:02:45] &gt;&gt; Elders, shoot the gun. We've been
[2:02:48] worried for too long. We've been fearful
[2:02:50] for too long. We've been letting it up,
[2:02:53] leaving it get up to the minister for
[2:02:54] too long. Pull the trigger.
[2:02:59] &gt;&gt; Get fed up with that devil. Get fed up
[2:03:02] with his lies. Get fed up with those
[2:03:05] tormenting spirits.
[2:03:06] [Music]
[2:03:10] &gt;&gt; It'll hit it.
[2:03:12] &gt;&gt; It'll destroy the yolks of the devil off
[2:03:14] your life. It'll defeat that spirit
[2:03:17] that's trying to destroy your home.
[2:03:19] Shoot the gun.
[2:03:23] &gt;&gt; Shoot the gun.
[2:03:25] We're got the sons and daughters of God.
[2:03:29] Why hold back?
[2:03:31] We have his mind. We have supreme
[2:03:34] authority. We know what he wants done
[2:03:37] with the word. Shoot it.
[2:03:41] &gt;&gt; Let the musicians come.
[2:03:44] &gt;&gt; Dance yourself into the battle.
[2:03:48] &gt;&gt; David wasn't picking up stones
[2:03:50] wandering. Well, I don't know. Am I
[2:03:51] doing right?
[2:03:53] &gt;&gt; He had already seen it.
[2:03:55] &gt;&gt; He'd already seen that devil fall.
[2:03:58] &gt;&gt; I tell you friends, I've already seen
[2:03:59] this devil fall. Sir,
[2:04:03] &gt;&gt; the devil don't have enough.
[2:04:06] &gt;&gt; I I I'll tell you what. I'll tell you
[2:04:08] what David did. Let me Let me just put
[2:04:09] it in our language that I like.
[2:04:13] When the Holy Ghost got a hold of that
[2:04:15] stone and hit him right in the eye,
[2:04:17] &gt;&gt; right? Right between the eyes and went
[2:04:19] over there and he got his own sword.
[2:04:22] Jubilation just flowing through his
[2:04:24] soul.
[2:04:25] &gt;&gt; Got that sword.
[2:04:31] Now, let me just say it Jonathan Martin
[2:04:32] style.
[2:04:35] If I was there,
[2:04:37] &gt;&gt; I would have looked at that giant and I
[2:04:39] would have said, "How do you like me
[2:04:40] now?
[2:04:47] &gt;&gt; You boast against me."
[2:04:50] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[2:04:51] &gt;&gt; You tried to discourage me.
[2:04:53] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[2:04:54] &gt;&gt; You tried to tell me I didn't have
[2:04:56] enough.
[2:04:57] How do you like me now, devil?
[2:05:01] &gt;&gt; Get a hold of his head. How do you like
[2:05:03] me now, devil? You don't have enough.
[2:05:07] &gt;&gt; The devil doesn't have enough. He
[2:05:09] doesn't have enough.
[2:05:12] God's already predestinated you to
[2:05:14] victory. It's shadow. He's already
[2:05:17] called you, already predestinated you,
[2:05:20] already glorified you positionally.
[2:05:23] [Applause]
[2:05:26] It's time to flex your muscles.
[2:05:29] &gt;&gt; It's time to put your faith into action.
[2:05:32] &gt;&gt; It's time to speak to that tormented
[2:05:35] spirit that's been tormenting you.
[2:05:39] &gt;&gt; Go ahead and get a hold of him.
[2:05:41] &gt;&gt; Say, "Devil, you don't have enough."
[2:05:44] &gt;&gt; Why don't you just look back in your
[2:05:45] life when the devil tried to tell you
[2:05:46] that he was going to destroy your life?
[2:05:49] &gt;&gt; I mean, come on. Go ahead. Let's go.
[2:05:52] Let's go through memories lane.
[2:05:54] &gt;&gt; Last year when the devil said, "I've got
[2:05:56] you." And you're here, aren't you?
[2:05:59] &gt;&gt; Don't you remember?
[2:06:01] &gt;&gt; The last tent meeting,
[2:06:02] &gt;&gt; he told you that you wouldn't make it
[2:06:04] this to this one.
[2:06:07] &gt;&gt; Don't you remember? Don't you remember,

[2:10:48] that greater is he that is in me.

[2:11:39] a hand clap of praise tonight? Amen. How
[2:11:42] many's got something greater in you than
[2:11:44] that which you're facing? Now, what a
[2:11:46] powerful message.
[2:11:48] The devil said, "You're a disgrace." I'm
[2:11:51] not a disgrace, but he said, "I'm Mrs.
[2:11:53] grace."
[2:11:54] &gt;&gt; We're not a disgrace. I'm Mrs. Grace.
[2:11:56] I've been called by Jesus Christ. I was
[2:11:59] called of God before the foundation of
[2:12:01] the world to overcome in this hour.
[2:12:03] Brother Johnson said, "You take your
[2:12:05] faith and arm it in your sling, turn in
[2:12:07] the general direction of the devil and
[2:12:09] just let it go." You know why? Because
[2:12:11] faith is the victory and it always finds
[2:12:13] its mark. No wonder God gave us faith. I
[2:12:15] believe that God gave us something
[2:12:16] that'll overcome every devil. It don't
[2:12:18] matter what you have what you're facing
[2:12:20] tonight. You may I don't know how you
[2:12:22] felt whenever you came in, but go ahead
[2:12:24] and just lift your hand and put the
[2:12:25] devil in it. I mean, take their sling
[2:12:26] and put it over their hand. say, "I'm
[2:12:28] just going to put the devil in his
[2:12:29] place. He told you he was going to quit.
[2:12:31] He told you to give up. He told you you
[2:12:33] couldn't make it. But I say, devil, I'm
[2:12:35] going on with Jesus just the same. You
[2:12:37] ain't going to stop me. You're not going
[2:12:39] to turn me around. You're not going to
[2:12:40] cause me to retreat. I've got one
[2:12:42] direction. I've been called of God, and
[2:12:44] I'm heaven bound."
[2:12:48] Amen. I've been called of God to move
[2:12:51] into another dimension. Can we sing
[2:12:52] that? Well, I'm going on with Jesus just
[2:12:56] the same.
[2:12:58] But I'm going on with Jesus just the
[2:13:01] same.
[2:13:02] Well, you might fall too.
[2:13:08] [Music]
[2:13:22] You might also accuse me, scandalize my
[2:13:26] name.
[2:13:27] Going on with Jesus just the same.
[2:13:31] Well, the devil ways a straight way. It
[2:13:34] has no crooks and bins. I got to go on
[2:13:37] with Jesus. I know he's my best friend.
[2:13:41] Well, Satan try to stop me. Push down
[2:13:44] the blocks in my way. But I rise up from
[2:13:47] my bend and knees going all the way. But
[2:13:51] I'm going on the tears just the same.
[2:13:55] I'm going on with Jesus just the same.
[2:13:59] Will you not for accuse me, scandalize
[2:14:03] my name? But I'm going on with Jesus
[2:14:07] just the same.
[2:14:09] Well, some people they may laugh, talk
[2:14:12] about me when I shout, but there's one
[2:14:15] thing I know. I know what I'm shouting
[2:14:18] about. When Satan try to stop me, put
[2:14:21] stumbling blocks in my way. I stand up
[2:14:24] for my Lord and this is what I say. I'm
[2:14:29] going on with Jesus just the same.
[2:14:33] But I'm going on with Jesus just the
[2:14:36] same.
[2:14:37] Well, you might talk about me standalize
[2:14:41] my name, but I'm going on. Let me ask
[2:14:44] you tonight,
[2:14:46] are you going on?
[2:14:49] Are you going on?
[2:14:52] Are you going on with Jesus just the
[2:14:54] same?
[2:14:56] Well, you might accuse me, scandalize my
[2:15:00] name, but I'm going on with Jesus just
[2:15:04] the same.
[2:15:06] Well, there are some places that I may
[2:15:09] never go and there are some things that
[2:15:13] I may not know, but this is one thing.
[2:15:18] And one thing I am sure that Jesus is a
[2:15:22] living for he's living in my soul. But
[2:15:25] I'm going on with Jesus just the same.
[2:15:29] Well, I'm going on with Jesus just the
[2:15:32] same.
[2:15:34] Well, you might accuse me. Standalize my
[2:15:38] name. Well, I'm going on with Jesus just
[2:15:41] the same. Are you going on?
[2:15:46] Are you going on? How many is going on?
[2:15:49] I'm going on with you. This is your
[2:15:51] opportunity tonight to put the devil in
[2:15:53] his place. It don't matter what you say
[2:15:56] about me. It don't matter what you think
[2:15:58] about me. But I'm going on with you just
[2:16:01] to see.
[2:16:02] Well, the devil weighs a straight. It
[2:16:05] has no
[2:16:07] but Jesus. I know he's my best friend.
[2:16:12] When the enemy's all around me, till the
[2:16:15] sorrow tears my eye, I fall down on my
[2:16:18] bend knees, but I rise up with a smile.
[2:16:22] But I'm going on with Jesus just the
[2:16:24] same.
[2:16:26] But I'm going on with Jesus just the
[2:16:29] same.
[2:16:31] Help my heart my feet scandalize my
[2:16:35] name. But I'm going on Jesus just the
[2:16:38] same.
[2:16:40] Are you going on? Are you going on?
[2:16:45] But I'm going on with Jesus just the
[2:16:48] same.
[2:16:49] Are you going on?
[2:16:52] Are you going on?
[2:16:54] I said I'm going on with Jesus just the
[2:16:58] same.
[2:17:04] How many's going on with the Lord
[2:17:06] tonight?
[2:17:07] See, brother M, where are we going? We
[2:17:09] got a destination
[2:17:11] &gt;&gt; and we're believers. We're the bride of
[2:17:13] Jesus Christ.
[2:17:14] &gt;&gt; That was God speaking to you tonight.
[2:17:17] &gt;&gt; You know why? Cuz it was the message of
[2:17:18] the hour. And that's God's message. He
[2:17:20] said, "It ain't no man's message. It
[2:17:22] ain't no pastor's message. It was God's
[2:17:24] message. We don't have a message of our
[2:17:26] own. We're running with the king's
[2:17:28] message." Amen. It ain't mine. It ain't
[2:17:30] our It's the king's message. He's
[2:17:33] entrusted it to the bride of Jesus
[2:17:34] Christ. And we're going somewhere
[2:17:36] tonight. Amen. And we ain't bound for
[2:17:38] this earth. We've been stuck on this
[2:17:40] earth long enough. But we're going
[2:17:42] somewhere tonight.
[2:17:43] &gt;&gt; Amen. I know what Satan, he's been
[2:17:44] trying to hold you down. You've been
[2:17:47] fighting with it all week and battling
[2:17:49] cuz you're trying to get ready for a
[2:17:50] meeting and you couldn't get you
[2:17:51] couldn't get the the world off your mind
[2:17:53] and the worry off your mind and trouble
[2:17:55] off your mind cuz you're trying to get
[2:17:57] ready for a meeting.
[2:17:58] &gt;&gt; So, because we're living in this old
[2:18:00] Exodus time, Satan just cast on the
[2:18:02] burden. But you know what? We going to
[2:18:03] tell the devil tonight, I'm going
[2:18:05] anyway. Somebody say, "I'm going
[2:18:08] anyway."
[2:18:09] &gt;&gt; I believe that tonight. I'm going
[2:18:10] anyway. Satan ain't got no right against
[2:18:13] the believers.

[2:27:54] &gt;&gt; I'm going to the I'm going to the
[2:27:56] &gt;&gt; I'm going to the
[2:27:59] I'm going to the meeting. And I'm going
[2:28:00] to shout.
[2:28:01] &gt;&gt; I'm going to the meeting. Trouble's
[2:28:03] over.
[2:28:04] &gt;&gt; I'm going to the meeting.
[2:28:05] &gt;&gt; Just wait.
[2:28:06] &gt;&gt; I'm going to the meeting
[2:28:07] &gt;&gt; to my brand new.
[2:28:11] [Music]
[2:28:13] &gt;&gt; I'm going to the meeting
[2:28:15] &gt;&gt; around the throne.
[2:28:19] &gt;&gt; I don't know about y'all, but I come to
[2:28:20] have church.
[2:28:22] &gt;&gt; I'm going to the meeting.
[2:28:24] &gt;&gt; God done chat that message was for me.
[2:28:25] He said, "You just step out and take
[2:28:27] it."
[2:28:27] &gt;&gt; That cost me $100.
[2:28:30] I'm going to get my victory.
[2:28:32] &gt;&gt; I paid for it.
[2:28:35] &gt;&gt; I'm going to get my victory.
[2:28:37] &gt;&gt; Step out and get it. Put the devil in
[2:28:38] his place.
[2:28:40] &gt;&gt; We're in a tent meeting on a Thursday
[2:28:41] night.
[2:28:43] &gt;&gt; Come to have church.
[2:28:46] &gt;&gt; The devil's a liar.
[2:28:48] &gt;&gt; Made you so sick you didn't want to be
[2:28:50] here. And
[2:28:51] &gt;&gt; dizziness and all these things going
[2:28:53] around. And
[2:28:54] &gt;&gt; man, I I don't know if I ought to go,
[2:28:55] but you came anyhow. We'll just put the
[2:28:58] devil in his place.
[2:29:00] &gt;&gt; We come to have church. I'm happy in the
[2:29:01] Lord
[2:29:02] &gt;&gt; and the devil's a liar.
[2:29:04] &gt;&gt; This is our meeting. It ain't the
[2:29:06] devil's meeting. So, sometimes you got
[2:29:08] to stop telling the devil's testimony
[2:29:09] and stop and start telling God's.
[2:29:12] &gt;&gt; That's that's my new saying to the
[2:29:14] devil. He's done showed his ignorance
[2:29:16] too much to get the believers to believe
[2:29:19] that they had to be defeated and beat
[2:29:20] down and had to be beat up in order to
[2:29:23] have church. You ain't got to be beat
[2:29:24] up. The word of God, it elevates you. It
[2:29:26] lifts you. It edifies you. It
[2:29:28] strengthens you. And it gives you
[2:29:30] victory over the devil.
[2:29:31] &gt;&gt; You don't have to be the son of God to
[2:29:33] get him into submission to the word of
[2:29:35] God. All you have to do is give him the
[2:29:36] victory of the message of the hour. And
[2:29:38] you'll watch him rise up
[2:29:40] &gt;&gt; and be victorious over his enemy. How do
[2:29:42] you like me now, devil?
[2:29:44] &gt;&gt; I want him right in my face. How you
[2:29:46] like me now? I've been nice for too
[2:29:47] long. How do you like me now, devil?
[2:29:49] &gt;&gt; You ain't never going to make nothing.
[2:29:50] How do you like me now? You ain't never
[2:29:52] going to do nothing for the Lord. How
[2:29:53] you like me now? You ain't nothing but a
[2:29:55] madeup makeup phony bunch of madeup man.
[2:29:59] But how do you like me now, devil? You
[2:30:01] couldn't do nothing for the Lord if the
[2:30:03] Lord came and gave it to you in a gift
[2:30:05] basket. But how do you like me now,
[2:30:06] devil? You don't have the ability. How
[2:30:09] do you like me now? You don't have the
[2:30:10] backing. How do you like me now? You
[2:30:12] don't have the support. How do you like
[2:30:14] me now? You don't have God on your side.
[2:30:16] How do you like me now, devil?
[2:30:19] &gt;&gt; It ain't the armies of Saul I've been
[2:30:20] fighting for anyway. It's the armies of
[2:30:22] the living God. And I'm going to say it
[2:30:24] right in front of every Philistine,
[2:30:26] every lion, giant, devil, Philistine
[2:30:28] spirit that would come under this tent.
[2:30:30] How do you like me now? I got a ride as
[2:30:33] a son of God. You got to ride as a
[2:30:35] daughter of God to stand up in the face
[2:30:37] of every enemy and say, "Devil, how do
[2:30:39] you like me now? I've got victory in the
[2:30:42] house of God." Time to put the devil in
[2:30:45] his place.
[2:30:46] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:30:47] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:30:48] &gt;&gt; We need to put him in his place. You
[2:30:50] want me to tell you how to put the devil
[2:30:51] in his place? I ain't even one way to
[2:30:53] put him in his place. You got to get in
[2:30:55] your place.
[2:30:56] &gt;&gt; Ain't that right? But said the devil's
[2:30:58] sitting there trying to poke things down
[2:31:00] your throat. He said, "Don't you believe
[2:31:01] it?" He said, "It can batter against
[2:31:03] you, but it can only get to you if you
[2:31:04] accept it."
[2:31:05] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[2:31:06] &gt;&gt; So I say, "Devil, I don't accept your
[2:31:08] lies. I'm victorious." I mean, lift your
[2:31:10] hand. Say, "I'm victorious. I ain't
[2:31:12] never going to accept it. I'm getting
[2:31:13] tired of the devil's lies anyway." Key
[2:31:15] of F.
[2:31:17] Well, I'm so tired of you, Satan.
[2:31:21] You've had me bound too long.
[2:31:25] I'm going to raise my hand to heaven.
[2:31:29] I'm going to sing me a happy song.
[2:31:32] [Music]
[2:31:35] Well, you said I couldn't make it. You
[2:31:38] told me not to try. But I'm going to
[2:31:41] live for Jesus until the day I die. I'm
[2:31:45] so tired of you, Satan. You've had me
[2:31:48] bound too long.
[2:31:53] I'm going to raise my hand to heaven.
[2:31:57] I'm going to sing me a victory song.
[2:32:01] Well, you threw the Hebrew children in a
[2:32:04] red hot burning fire. But they came out
[2:32:07] the winner. Devil, you came out the
[2:32:10] liar. I'm so tired of you, Satan.
[2:32:14] You've had me down for too long.
[2:32:20] I'm going to raise my hand to heaven.
[2:32:23] I'm going to sing me a happy song.
[2:32:27] Well, if you're one of God's children,
[2:32:30] you're tired of being bound. Just raise
[2:32:32] your hands to heaven. Pull you a
[2:32:35] blessing down. I'm so tired of you,
[2:32:38] Satan.
[2:32:40] You've had me bound too long.
[2:32:45] Oh, I'm going to raise my hand to
[2:32:47] heaven.
[2:32:49] I'm going to sing me a happy song.
[2:32:52] Anybody feel like telling the devil
[2:32:53] something tonight? Well, now listen to
[2:32:56] me, devil. I'll tell you what I'm going
[2:32:59] to do. You walked on me long enough, so
[2:33:03] now I'm going to walk on you. I'm so
[2:33:05] tired of you, Satan.
[2:33:08] You've had me back too long.
[2:33:12] soul.
[2:33:14] I'm going to raise my hands on heaven.
[2:33:17] I'm going to sing me a happy song.
[2:33:21] Well, you told me not to sing. You told
[2:33:24] me not to shout, but I'm going to take
[2:33:27] the word of God. Turn that devil out.
[2:33:30] I'm sometimes Satan.
[2:33:34] You've had me down too long.
[2:33:38] Oh, I'm going to raise my hand to
[2:33:42] heaven. I'm going to sing me. How many
[2:33:45] Davids do we have here in the building
[2:33:47] tonight? If you want God's children and
[2:33:50] you're tired of being bound, just draw
[2:33:53] your sword and put on the devil's head
[2:33:55] and dance all around. I'm so tired of
[2:33:58] you, Satan.
[2:34:00] You've had me bound too long.
[2:34:06] I'm going to raise my hand to heaven.
[2:34:09] I'm going to sing you a happy song. Let
[2:34:12] me just say the truth. You said I was a
[2:34:15] weak Christian. You said I had no power.
[2:34:18] But I was given a party over you by the
[2:34:21] rest who turned me out. I'm so tired of
[2:34:24] you, Satan.
[2:34:26] You've had me bound too long.
[2:34:31] Oh, I'm going to raise my hand to
[2:34:34] heaven.
[2:34:35] I'm going to sing me a happy song.
[2:34:39] Well, I've got a right to sing. I've got
[2:34:42] a right to dance. But I'm not going to
[2:34:45] wait till tomorrow. Cuz tonight, God
[2:34:47] gave me a chance. I'm so tired of you,
[2:34:50] Satan.
[2:34:52] You've had me bound too long.
[2:34:57] Oh, I'm going to raise my hand to
[2:35:00] heaven. I'm going to sing me a happy
[2:35:04] song.
[2:35:06] [Music]
[2:35:08] Well, listen to me, dear. I tell you
[2:35:11] what I'm going to do. You walked on me
[2:35:14] long enough, so I want to walk on you.
[2:35:17] And sometimes, baby, Satan,
[2:35:21] you've had me down too long.
[2:35:27] I'm going to raise my hand to heaven.
[2:35:30] I'm going to sing me a happy song.
[2:35:36] Well, I wrote a little message. I wrote
[2:35:40] it just for you. And I put it where you
[2:35:43] could read it. Right on the bottom of my
[2:35:45] shoe. I'm so tired of you, Satan.
[2:35:49] You had me bound up way too long.
[2:35:54] So I'm going to raise my hand to heaven.
[2:35:59] I'm going to sing me a happy song.
[2:36:03] You can call me Pentecost. Might be a
[2:36:06] little loud for you. But let me tell you
[2:36:08] what a prophet said. If you felt like I
[2:36:10] fell, you be something, too. I'm so
[2:36:13] tired of you, Satan. You've held me down
[2:36:17] too long.
[2:36:18] [Music]
[2:36:21] I'm going to lift my hand to heaven. I'm
[2:36:25] going to sing me a happy song.
[2:36:31] A happy song.
[2:36:33] I'm going in a happy song.
[2:36:37] A happy song.
[2:36:39] A happy song.
[2:36:42] A victory song.
[2:36:44] A victory song.
[2:36:46] A picture song.
[2:36:49] Well, I wrote a little message. I wrote
[2:36:52] it just for you. And I put it right
[2:36:55] where you are, devil, on the bottom of
[2:36:58] my shoe. I'm so tired of you, Satan.
[2:37:02] You've had me bound just too long.
[2:37:08] I'm going to rest my hands toward
[2:37:10] heaven. I'm going to sing me a victory
[2:37:14] song.
[2:37:15] I said, I'm going to raise my hand to
[2:37:18] heaven
[2:37:20] and I'm going to sing me a victory song.
[2:37:28] Oh, somebody clap the victory tonight.
[2:37:30] Somebody shout the victory. Somebody
[2:37:32] dance the victory for the devil in his
[2:37:34] place.
[2:37:36] I've got victory over the devil.
[2:37:39] I can tell the devil don't like that.
[2:37:41] But good. He's been beating up me for
[2:37:43] months. It's my opportunity to hit
[2:37:45] again.
[2:37:46] &gt;&gt; Brother Andrew done preached it last
[2:37:47] night. He said he came here blow after
[2:37:50] blow after blow. But here's your
[2:37:52] opportunity to turn back to that same
[2:37:54] devil and hit him blow after blow after
[2:37:57] blow again, night after night.
[2:38:00] And he drive every devil out of your
[2:38:02] life. I want to send him right back to
[2:38:05] hell where he came from and tell all his
[2:38:07] little devil buddies, "Don't bother them
[2:38:09] people under that tent. You know what?
[2:38:12] Leave them. There there's a no
[2:38:14] trespassing sign out there. It said, "No
[2:38:15] devils are welcome in this place." I
[2:38:18] think we need to stamp it right on our
[2:38:19] heart. There ain't no devil welcome in
[2:38:21] this place. I got a no trespassing sign
[2:38:24] on my life. Devil, you ain't welcome.
[2:38:27] &gt;&gt; Amen. You know what the devil said? I'll
[2:38:30] tell you what I'll do. I've done
[2:38:31] everything to take you out and it didn't
[2:38:33] work. Shot every weapon at you and it
[2:38:35] didn't work. Fired every bullet at you
[2:38:37] and it never worked. But you don't even
[2:38:40] have to be a good aim to hit the devil.
[2:38:43] That's what I heard tonight. That he's
[2:38:45] been training for 6,000 years trying to
[2:38:48] destroy you, but he never could take you
[2:38:51] out in just a few days anointed under
[2:38:54] the power of the Holy Ghost. A little
[2:38:56] young believer can take a sling by faith
[2:38:58] and hit the devil right where it counts.
[2:39:01] &gt;&gt; I thought, my, he was trained and
[2:39:03] couldn't kill you. My goodness, you just
[2:39:06] took a little bit of faith. My I'll tell
[2:39:08] you what we tell the devil. He says,
[2:39:09] "You know what? I've done gave up. I'll
[2:39:11] tell you what I'll do. I'll just kill
[2:39:12] you. I'll take your life and then then
[2:39:15] I'll have you. But you know what? I'm
[2:39:16] going to tell the devil tonight." Well,
[2:39:18] Satan, I died already.
[2:39:22] [Music]
[2:39:23] My life has been hidden.
[2:39:27] And he said, "I'm the resurrection."
[2:39:30] And he gave me eternal life. So I'm so
[2:39:33] tired of you, Satan.
[2:39:36] You've had me bound too long.
[2:39:40] I said
[2:39:42] I'm going to raise my hand to heaven.
[2:39:45] I'm going to sing me a victory song.
[2:39:49] Will the prophet preach the message back
[2:39:52] in 1962?
[2:39:54] He proved to every believer they had
[2:39:57] power over you. I'm so tired of you,
[2:40:00] Satan.
[2:40:02] You've had me bound too long.
[2:40:06] But I said I'm going to raise my hand to
[2:40:10] heaven.
[2:40:11] I'm going to sing me a happy song.
[2:40:15] I said
[2:40:17] I'm going to raise my hand to heaven.
[2:40:21] I'm going to sing me a happy song.

[2:40:37] &gt;&gt; Amen. How many How many's looking
[2:40:39] forward to He said we ain't got to wait.
[2:40:41] Take the devil push him out every
[2:40:42] service.
[2:40:43] &gt;&gt; A little bit more and a little bit more
[2:40:46] &gt;&gt; until you get so free in the Holy Ghost
[2:40:47] that you don't even you don't even know
[2:40:49] who you are. And you don't even you
[2:40:51] don't even know where you're at. That's
[2:40:53] where we want to get to. And when you
[2:40:54] get to that place, then the devil, he
[2:40:56] don't even know what to do with you.
[2:40:59] &gt;&gt; Isn't that our desire? Let's get to
[2:41:01] where God can use you so much that the
[2:41:02] devil can't use you no more.
[2:41:05] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:41:06] &gt;&gt; Get to the place where God can use you
[2:41:08] so much that the devil can't use you no
[2:41:09] more.
[2:41:10] &gt;&gt; Cuz somebody's using you.
[2:41:13] &gt;&gt; Hello, somebody.
[2:41:15] &gt;&gt; Somebody's using you.
[2:41:18] &gt;&gt; But I want to get to where the devil
[2:41:20] ain't got no room.
[2:41:21] &gt;&gt; Said I can't use that one. He's broke.
[2:41:23] He need to come with an owner's manual.
[2:41:24] You can't get him to do anything you
[2:41:25] want him to do. Amen.
[2:41:27] &gt;&gt; I want to be like
[2:41:29] &gt;&gt; I want to be like a Teeu item,
[2:41:34] &gt;&gt; owner's manual and instruction manual on
[2:41:37] how to put together
[2:41:39] the brand new boat motor that you just
[2:41:41] bought off Teeu.
[2:41:43] You ever opened up the manual? First of
[2:41:45] all, it ain't in any good language.
[2:41:48] And then when you find the English
[2:41:49] language, it's words that none no
[2:41:51] English man ever really used. And you
[2:41:54] can't understand it. Half the pages are
[2:41:56] gone. The pictures don't line up. The
[2:41:57] bolt holes say here, they ain't even
[2:41:59] there.
[2:42:01] That's my owner's manual. When the devil
[2:42:03] tries to use me, I want it to be so
[2:42:05] mixed up. I can't do nothing with it. It
[2:42:08] It just seems like a mess. They seem
[2:42:09] like a wreck. I don't know what to do
[2:42:11] with him,
[2:42:13] but God can take a hold of you and use
[2:42:15] you. I never tried to be a somebody
[2:42:17] anyway. Y'all can call me T-Mu if you
[2:42:19] want to from now on. I never tried to be
[2:42:22] a somebody anyway, but God can use me.
[2:42:25] &gt;&gt; That's what I want to be. I just want to
[2:42:27] be somebody God can use. How many raise
[2:42:29] your hands say, "Brother Matt, that's my
[2:42:30] desire. I just want to be somebody God
[2:42:33] can use and let God use us for his
[2:42:35] glory."
[2:42:37] &gt;&gt; Amen. That we can glorify his name
[2:42:40] forever and ever. One day we'll be we'll
[2:42:42] join him on the other side and we'll be
[2:42:45] singing that same song.
