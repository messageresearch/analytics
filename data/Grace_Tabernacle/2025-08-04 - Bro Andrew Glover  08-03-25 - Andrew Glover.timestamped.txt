[32:08] hunt.
[32:10] Seen the picture. This boy don't have a
[32:12] chance. He got a malard in his hand.
[32:18] What a blessing.
[32:20] I just say this is an honor to be able
[32:23] to here and dedicated little fella and
[32:28] see what God has done in Kyle and
[32:30] Becca's life. Certainly Lord has really
[32:35] really brought him a long way and
[32:36] brought them together and gave them a
[32:38] gift like this and bring nothing hardly
[32:42] any greater than having a new life.
[32:46] so appreciate their stand on the word
[32:49] just to see the the growth in their
[32:51] family over the past few months and just
[32:55] an honor.
[32:57] So we just want to dedicate little Stson
[33:00] and Leroy.
[33:01] Amen. Dedicate him back to the Lord.
[33:05] Maybe y'all could pray with us this
[33:06] morning.
[33:08] And gracious heavenly father, Lord, what
[33:11] a privilege that it is Lord God to this
[33:15] little gift of life that you've given
[33:17] us. Lord, what a a sign or what a a
[33:23] perfection that we see looking at the
[33:25] innocence of a child,
[33:28] Lord, knowing that even when he's born
[33:30] into this life, Lord, that there's no
[33:33] wrong that he's ever done, Lord, no
[33:35] thought that he's ever thought that was
[33:37] wrong, Lord, just a bundle of love and
[33:41] joy. Lord, it just brings such wonderful
[33:44] feelings to our life. And Lord, we just
[33:48] ask you this morning, Lord, as this
[33:50] young family and Kyle and Rebecca, Lord,
[33:53] have come to dedicate their child to
[33:56] you. And Lord, to make a commitment to
[33:59] serve you and Lord, to raise him
[34:01] according to your word. And Lord, that
[34:03] may one day, Lord, this young man be
[34:05] able to stand and be a testimony in this
[34:08] world.
[34:09] God, every great man that's ever walked
[34:11] upon the face of the earth, Lord. Every
[34:13] prophet, every every gifted man, Lord,
[34:16] that you've ever used, Lord, everyone of
[34:18] us came this way, Lord, they they they
[34:21] came to the world as a baby. And Lord,
[34:24] were held in the arms of of men and
[34:27] priests throughout the ages. And Lord,
[34:29] grew to be great men. And Lord, I just
[34:31] ask you this morning, Lord, that you
[34:33] would keep your hands upon this young
[34:34] man. God, may he be raised, Lord, in
[34:37] such a way, Lord, that he would come to
[34:39] an age that he would dedicate his life
[34:41] to you and he would serve you all the
[34:43] days of his life. Lord, may you use him,
[34:45] Lord, the gift that you place in each
[34:47] one of us, God. May we do our best,
[34:49] Lord, as a people and a family, Lord, to
[34:52] raise him according to your word. And
[34:54] Lord, I just ask you to bless this
[34:56] family. Bless Kyle and Becca, Lord, in
[34:58] all that they do. Lord, we give them to
[35:01] you. In the name of Jesus Christ, we
[35:03] pray. Amen.
[35:11] [Music]
[35:14] He likes me
[35:17] [Music]
[35:19] now. Isn't that precious? Oh, y'all hear
[35:22] that? He said, "Uncle Matt, right
[35:24] there."
[35:26] His first words was recorded.
[35:31] Won't you stand to your feet this
[35:32] morning?
[35:34] [Music]
[35:37] He said Wednesday we had to claim it. So
[35:40] just trying to claim them first words. I
[35:43] always did a good job trying to get
[35:45] babies to say my name first because my
[35:46] name was Matt and their mama spent
[35:48] months trying to teach them to say mama.
[35:51] So ma and matt's easy to easy to get a
[35:54] mat out of them, you know. So I've done
[35:57] I've been guilty of that before.
[36:01] What a what a gift. Isn't that
[36:02] wonderful? Amen.
[36:04] just all of our young families and new
[36:07] babies. I think they told me there was
[36:10] we had eight new babies that was born
[36:12] within a three or four month period
[36:15] there or maybe a few more months, but
[36:17] just I know there's more on the way and
[36:21] just it's just great gifts that God
[36:24] gives us and we certainly appreciate all
[36:27] these young families and you know I just
[36:29] say it's an honor as a pastor to see
[36:31] young men I know sometimes people look
[36:34] at them on the outside and they see all
[36:36] their mistakes and all the failures that
[36:39] they go through and everything. You can
[36:41] find that on Facebook about any kid,
[36:43] they y'all sit around and kind of, you
[36:46] know, look at them and it's easy to to
[36:49] cast them aside and say they're not
[36:51] growing and all this stuff. But, you
[36:53] know, the work of God sometimes you
[36:55] can't see it on the outside, but the
[36:56] work of God is done on the inside of a
[36:58] man. And whenever God gets to working on
[37:00] him long enough on the inside, It may
[37:03] take a while, but then all of a sudden
[37:04] the outside starts to show what God's
[37:06] doing on the inside. So, I think we
[37:09] ought to we ought to do the work on the
[37:10] inside and help help them get to a
[37:12] place. And I just say it's an honor as a
[37:15] pastor to see young men and women that
[37:17] grow up and and start their life and
[37:19] dedicate their life to the Lord. They
[37:21] may have some rough patches and every
[37:23] one of us do, but to see them dedicate
[37:25] their life to God. And our church is
[37:27] filled with young families in their in
[37:30] their early 20s and young men and women
[37:32] serving the Lord, young children, and I
[37:34] can't think of a greater a greater
[37:37] reward than to see that. And it's just
[37:39] an honor. I want to say God bless each
[37:41] one of you that's made a commitment to
[37:43] serve God and you elders uh that that do
[37:46] their part, to be able to make an
[37:48] atmosphere where new lives can grow and
[37:51] and change. And it's just a privilege to
[37:54] be a part of it, the work of God in
[37:57] people's lives. So, I just want to say
[37:59] God bless all of our young families,
[38:01] young fathers. Keep on the fire in line
[38:03] and do all that you can to serve serve
[38:06] the Lord and raise your children
[38:08] according to the word of God. Amen. You
[38:10] love the Lord this morning.
[38:12] &gt;&gt; And how many's ready to hear the word of
[38:13] God? And brother Andrew will be speaking
[38:16] for us this morning.
[38:18] We just appreciate Wednesday night. And
[38:21] he said he was kind of laying a
[38:22] foundation for this morning. So, I'm
[38:24] anxious to hear what God has in store
[38:27] for us. Amen. Can we sing the goodness
[38:29] of God?
[38:32] I love you, Lord.
[38:37] Oh, your mercy
[38:40] fails me.
[38:43] All my days
[38:45] I've been held in your hands.
[38:48] [Music]
[38:50] From the moment that I wake up
[38:54] till I lay my head,
[38:58] I will sing of the goodness of God.
[39:04] [Music]
[39:08] All my life you have been faithful.

[39:59] I've known you as a father.
[40:03] I've known you as a friend.
[40:07] and thy lives in the goodness of God.
[40:14] I think you say this with your heart
[40:16] this morning. All my life you've been a
[40:19] faithful God.

[40:50] I love your voice.
[40:54] For you have led me through many trials
[40:59] in the darkest night.
[41:02] You've been close like no other.
[41:05] [Music]
[41:06] I've known you as a father.
[41:10] Is that not the truth this morning?
[41:12] You've been my dearest friend I have. I
[41:16] want to give you glory this morning.
[41:18] Thank you, Lord, for all you've done for
[41:20] me. For I know, in all my life,
[41:26] you have been faithful.
[41:30] All my life you feel so good with every
[41:37] breath
[41:39] that I am able.
[41:42] Yes, I will sing of the goodness of God.
[41:50] I will sing
[41:52] of the goodness. Can you sing it once
[41:55] again? Will I say
[41:59] all my life
[42:02] you have been faithful
[42:06] all my life.
[42:09] [Music]
[42:13] Every breath that I am able,
[42:19] I will sing of the goodness of God.
[42:26] I will sing
[42:28] of the goodness of God.

[42:35] of praise this morning? Amen. How many
[42:38] can testify of the goodness of God? You
[42:41] can testify of his mercy and his grace.
[42:44] Amen. Have we got any witnesses in the
[42:45] building this morning that he's the
[42:47] unfailing God?
[42:48] &gt;&gt; Amen. He's unchanging in his ways. He's
[42:51] unchanging in his nature. Amen. He's
[42:54] right here this morning in the power of
[42:55] his resurrection. Amen. Fulfilling and
[42:58] doing everything that his word said he
[43:00] would do. Amen. Amen. My what a what a
[43:03] powerful atmosphere in the building here
[43:04] this morning. And I told brother Matt in
[43:06] the back room, I said that atmosphere
[43:08] out there is electrifying. Amen. Just
[43:11] amen. I I tell you, you get a bunch of
[43:13] believers together that believe God and
[43:15] they ain't got no hidden motives or
[43:17] objectives or agendas. They just want to
[43:19] worship God and bless his name. Amen.
[43:21] They begin to put little licks of fire
[43:23] together and before long the pillar of
[43:25] fire comes down and starts moving
[43:27] throughout the congregation and healings
[43:29] start taking place and miracles start

[43:44] And amen. I tell you I was just in my
[43:46] office this morning listening to the
[43:48] prophet of God and he made a statement
[43:50] brother David. He said, "The Church of
[43:52] Living God thrives on the supernatural."
[43:54] &gt;&gt; Amen. And I tell you this morning, I
[43:56] believe we're a supernatural church.
[43:58] Amen. I believe we're a supernatural
[44:00] people. I'm sorry. I don't believe we're

[44:03] thriving. Amen. I believe we're
[44:05] overcoming by the grace of God. Amen. We
[44:08] we thank the Lord for his mercy this
[44:10] morning. And want to say God bless
[44:12] Brother Kyle and Sister Beck and the new
[44:14] baby there. What a beautiful dedication

[44:41] Want to say it's an honor to have my
[44:43] in-laws here with me somewhere. God

[45:16] preaching. I don't think we've slowed

[45:36] of things we could say this morning, but
[45:38] I don't know about you, I want to say
[45:39] the right thing. Let's approach you this
[45:42] morning. Heavenly Father, Lord, as your
[45:44] believers have gathered here on this
[45:46] beautiful resurrection Sunday, Lord, to
[45:49] the world, it's another day in the week,
[45:51] but to your believers, it's a divine
[45:53] appointment. Father, it's a day that
[45:55] we've been preparing for, Lord, all week
[45:58] long. Father, from the service Wednesday
[46:00] to now, Lord, we've been longing to be
[46:03] back in your presence, to be gathered
[46:05] with believers of like precious faith.
[46:07] Lord, we want to thank you this morning
[46:09] for the grace that you've given us, dear
[46:11] God, to be able to be here. Lord, I want
[46:14] to thank you for this assembly, for our
[46:16] pastor who stands for this end time
[46:18] word. Lord, I want to thank you for the
[46:20] power of transformation of lives that is
[46:22] here on display this morning. Lord, to
[46:26] be able to stand here and look across
[46:27] the congregation and to survey, Lord.
[46:30] Father, I'm not just looking at
[46:32] humanity, your individuals, Lord. But,
[46:35] Father, I'm looking at the purchase of
[46:36] your blood. Yes, Lord, we have mistakes.
[46:40] We make failures, Lord. But, Lord, as
[46:42] your prophet has said, when you look at
[46:44] us, you don't see our mistakes. You
[46:46] don't see our failures, but Lord, you
[46:48] see your blood. Lord, I pray this
[46:51] morning as we endeavor to look into your
[46:53] word. Lord, I'm asking you to come by
[46:55] this way in a special way today, Father.
[46:58] Lord, may you answer needs here today,
[47:00] may you answer questions, oh God. Lord,
[47:03] if there's anything that we have on our
[47:05] heart this morning to do, Lord, it's to
[47:07] get oursel out of the way that you could
[47:09] come and Lord, you could speak to the
[47:11] needs of your believing children, dear
[47:13] God, Lord, that they would be edified by
[47:16] their visitation to your house this
[47:18] morning. Father, I pray for those that
[47:20] are sick and bodied this morning. May
[47:22] the angel of healing go by their way.
[47:24] For those that are bound this morning, I
[47:26] pray the angel of deliverance would stop
[47:28] by that heart this morning. Lord, if
[47:30] there be one here empty today, dear God,
[47:32] I pray you would open the windows of
[47:34] heaven. And Lord, you would fill every
[47:36] vessel here with the dynamics of your
[47:38] spirit, oh God. Lord, we're not looking
[47:40] for just another service or just another
[47:42] gathering, but Lord, we're looking for
[47:44] an amaz experience. Lord, where the
[47:47] bread of life is broken and given to the
[47:49] hungry children. Father, forgive us this
[47:52] morning of our failures. Lord, forgive
[47:54] us of our shortcomings. Oh God, may you
[47:56] sweep through this building today and
[47:58] the power of your resurrection. Lord, we
[48:01] we acknowledge your presence and step
[48:03] down in the building this morning. Now,
[48:05] Lord, we're asking you come among us
[48:07] today in the power of your word. We love
[48:09] you this morning and we thank you for
[48:11] your mercy and grace. In the mighty name
[48:14] of Jesus Christ, we pray. Oh, I wonder
[48:17] if anybody just like to slip their hands
[48:19] up this morning and just worship him for
[48:21] a moment. Lord, I love you. I thank you
[48:23] for your mercies. I thank you for your
[48:25] grace, Lord. Father, I thank you for
[48:28] your faithfulness, Lord. I thank you for
[48:29] your provision, oh God. Lord, I thank
[48:32] you for healing my body, for saving my
[48:34] children, for revealing this word to my
[48:36] heart. Lord, I don't want to rush this
[48:38] moment in your presence. Dear God, I
[48:40] want to worship you, Father. Lord, I
[48:43] want to honor you this morning. We bless
[48:45] your name.
[48:48] Hallelujah. Hallelujah.
[48:50] Hallelujah.
[48:53] And all my life you have been faithful.
[48:59] [Music]
[49:01] And all my life you have been so so good
[49:09] with every breath. Hallelujah.
[49:13] Oh, we worship you this morning.
[49:16] Hallelujah. Won't you just raise your
[49:18] handstream for just a moment and worship
[49:20] him this morning? His presence is
[49:22] stepped in the building
[49:24] of the goodness of God. Let's sing with
[49:28] all our hearts.
[49:31] And all my life you have been faithful.
[49:35] Thank you, Lord.
[49:39] All my life have been
[49:44] [Music]
[49:45] [Applause]
[49:46] [Music]
[49:54] of the goodness of God.
[49:59] Yes, I will sing.
[50:01] [Music]
[50:06] Hallelujah.
[50:07] Oh, bless his name this morning. Amen.
[50:10] He's in the building today. Hallelujah.
[50:13] If you have your Bibles this morning, we
[50:16] want to go to his word today. The book
[50:18] of St. Mark, the 11th chapter.
[50:22] Amen.
[50:24] Amen. He's worthy this morning.
[50:28] Amen.
[50:30] I don't know about you, I don't ever
[50:32] want his presence to become.
[50:34] Amen.
[50:36] Want to be able to acknowledge him when
[50:38] he comes in the room. Amen.
[50:40] St. Mark 11 verse 22. I see many
[50:45] visitors in our gates this morning. God
[50:46] bless you all. Honored to have you here
[50:49] today. Mark 11 and 22.
[50:53] Love the Lord this morning.
[50:56] And Jesus answering saith unto them,
[51:00] have faith in God.
[51:03] For verily I say unto you, that
[51:06] whosoever shall say unto this mountain,
[51:09] not look at it, but speak to it,
[51:13] &gt;&gt; be thou removed, and be thou cast into
[51:15] the sea, and shall not doubt in his
[51:18] heart, but shall believe that those
[51:21] things which he saith shall come to
[51:23] pass, he shall have whatsoever he saith.
[51:29] So it was not just speaking, but there
[51:32] was instruction on what to say. Now in
[51:35] the book of Revelation the 22nd chapter,
[51:38] Revelation 22
[51:41] and verse number 6.
[51:46] Revelation 22
[51:49] verse number 6.
[51:52] And he said unto me, these sayings are
[51:54] faithful and true. The Lord God of the
[51:57] holy prophet sent his angel to show unto
[51:59] his servants the things which must
[52:02] shortly be done. Behold, I come quickly.
[52:06] Blessed is he that keepeth the sayings
[52:09] of the prophecy of this book. And I,
[52:12] John, saw these things, and heard them.
[52:15] And when I heard and seen, I fell down
[52:17] to worship before the feet of the angel
[52:20] which showed me these things. Then saith
[52:23] he unto me, see thou do it not, for I am
[52:26] of thy fellow servant, and of thy
[52:28] brethren the prophets, and of them which
[52:30] keep the sayings of this book, worship
[52:33] God. Now look here. And he saith unto
[52:37] me, seal not the sayings of the prophecy
[52:41] of this book, for the time is at hand.
[52:45] Amen. We ask the Lord this morning to
[52:47] bless the reading of his word. as you
[52:48] can have your seats here this morning. I
[52:51] want to by the help of the Lord to maybe
[52:53] pick up this morning. I don't really
[52:55] have the time to go back to Wednesday.
[52:56] So, uh I'm just going to pick up and
[52:58] preach. So, we'll just all get in the
[53:00] same channel this morning. If I would
[53:02] take a title this morning, I want to
[53:03] speak to you again on approaching God by
[53:06] the right saying. But maybe to pull a
[53:08] subtitle out of that, I want to say
[53:10] this. Unseal the sayings of the book.
[53:14] Amen. Unseal the saints of the book. Now
[53:17] uh truly I believe what the Bible says
[53:19] when the Bible uh tells us that life and
[53:22] death is in the power of the tongue. How
[53:25] many knows the Bible says life and death
[53:27] lays in the power of the tongue. And you
[53:29] know uh by our words we can be blessed
[53:32] and by our words we can be condemned and
[53:34] amen by our words we can be healed and
[53:36] by our words we can continue amen in the
[53:39] same condition. So there is power amen
[53:42] in our tongue. The Bible actually tells
[53:43] us that we possess the promises of God
[53:46] by the word of faith that is in our
[53:49] mouths. Now, uh when you look here at
[53:51] this word approach, it means to draw
[53:52] closer to. It means a means of access to
[53:56] approach. It means in order to
[53:58] especially or in order to create a
[54:00] desired result. Now, I'm speaking this
[54:03] morning on approaching God by the right
[54:05] saying. And when you look there at that
[54:07] word sane, it is a short collection,
[54:10] amen, of forceful expressions that
[54:12] generally contain truth, instruction,
[54:15] advice, and wisdom. So if you have a
[54:18] saying, you have collected these
[54:19] sayings. And these sayings contain
[54:22] truth, they contain instruction, they
[54:24] contain advice and wisdom. Now in Mark
[54:27] 11 again from the Amplified Bible, Jesus
[54:29] replied in verse 22 and said, "Have
[54:32] faith in God constantly." Now, I don't
[54:34] know about you, but that's what I want
[54:35] to have is faith in God constantly. He
[54:38] said, "I assure you and most solemnly
[54:40] say to you that whosoever says to this
[54:43] mountain, now be thou lifted up and
[54:46] thrown into the sea and does not doubt
[54:48] in his heart in God's unlimited power,
[54:51] but believes what he says is going to
[54:54] take place, it will be done for him in
[54:56] accordance with God's will." So whenever
[54:59] a believer speaks, they're not just
[55:01] saying something, but rather they're
[55:03] saying something that's in accordance
[55:05] with God's will. And we know that his
[55:07] will is his word. Now, the prophet of
[55:10] God would say, "Let me tell you this, by
[55:11] his word. He cannot go contrary to that
[55:15] word." He said, "He has already
[55:17] purchased your desire if it's according
[55:20] to his will." Amen. If you got a desire
[55:23] this morning, I've got good news to you
[55:25] that God has already purchased your
[55:28] desire. Amen. According to his will and
[55:31] his will is to heal you. And his will is
[55:34] to give you your desire. Amen. Amen.
[55:37] I'll say this. Approach is everything,
[55:39] folks. Amen. There is a right approach
[55:41] and there is a wrong approach. And the
[55:43] prophet of God would say that a man walk
[55:46] out there and say, I'll show you I can
[55:48] move the mountain. Mountain be moved. It
[55:51] doesn't happen. Certainly not because
[55:53] your motive is not right and your
[55:55] objective is not right. Amen. Now again
[55:58] I just want to read this to you to lay a
[56:00] foundation the prophet of God and the
[56:02] approach to God. He shows us that there
[56:04] is a connection. Amen. Between our
[56:06] approach and our speech. He said God has
[56:09] a way of approach. There's a way you
[56:11] approach a king. The boy that wants to
[56:12] approach a young lady. Amen. There's a
[56:15] certain approach. Now you can't just
[56:17] come up there and say hey there. like to
[56:19] meet you and shake your hand. She isn't
[56:21] very much of a lady. Amen. She'll let
[56:23] you know where to get on and where to
[56:25] get off. See, there's a certain way you
[56:27] want to approach it. He said, "And
[56:29] there's a way to approach all things.
[56:31] And there's a way, amen, to approach
[56:34] God." How many believes that there's a
[56:35] way, amen, to approach God. And if we
[56:38] don't know the approach to God, then
[56:41] we'll never be able to get an audience
[56:43] with God. So if you don't know how to
[56:46] approach him, you're never going to get
[56:48] an audience with him. Amen. You've got
[56:50] to know the way to approach. And accord
[56:53] you don't just walk up there to the
[56:54] judge on the stand and say, "Hey, judge,
[56:57] I want to talk to you a little bit." He
[56:59] said, "Somebody will throw you out of
[57:00] the courtroom." See? Amen. And we must
[57:02] find the way to approach, Amen. the
[57:05] great divine judge, which is God
[57:07] himself. Amen. I I'll say it like this
[57:10] again. We don't approach God under fear,
[57:13] &gt;&gt; but rather we approach God under faith.
[57:16] And faith is a revelation. It's a
[57:19] revelation of the will of God. And faith
[57:21] is not loose, but faith is based upon
[57:24] some noted fact. Again, brother Ram
[57:26] said, "You got to know something about
[57:28] what you're having faith in." See,
[57:30] before you can have faith in it. So, we
[57:32] first must know how and what God's
[57:35] desire is. See? Amen. So, we got to know
[57:38] what God's desire is. We got to know
[57:41] what God's plan is and how to approach
[57:44] God by that plan. So, it's not just
[57:46] knowing God's desire, knowing God's
[57:49] plan, but there's got to come
[57:50] instruction to know how, amen, to
[57:53] approach God by his desire and by his
[57:56] plan. See, when we know his plan and we
[57:58] know his desire, Brother Ram said, we
[58:01] can walk up boldly to the throne of
[58:03] grace and we can plead what the plan is
[58:06] promised us. Listen. Amen. I want you to
[58:08] know this morning that God's plan, Amen,
[58:11] is not a church manual. Amen. Amen.
[58:13] God's plan is not a handbook or a code
[58:15] of morals or a book of ethics. Amen. But
[58:18] God's plan is the Bible. The prophet of
[58:21] God said God's plan is laid out in his
[58:23] Bible. And this is what we must go by.
[58:26] It must come from his word. See, because
[58:29] my words will fail. I'm a man. But God's
[58:32] words can't fail because it's God. He
[58:35] said, "If it's the Holy Spirit coming to
[58:37] you and begins to teach anything outside
[58:40] of this Bible," Amen. It's not the Holy
[58:43] Ghost. He said, "See, that's the kind of
[58:45] tutor we got is the Holy Spirit to
[58:48] reveal and to bring the discipline book
[58:51] of the Father and to reveal to you what
[58:54] God's plan is." He said again, there's
[58:56] no scripture in the Bible, amen, that
[58:59] contradicts itself. See? Amen. We've got
[59:01] to humble ourselves. We've got to throw
[59:03] away our ideas about it and we've got to
[59:07] accept what God's plan of it is. He said
[59:10] it's got to come through God's provided
[59:12] plan. Now, amen. Can I just establish
[59:14] this? God's provided plan is the Bible.
[59:18] Amen. It's not an idea. It's not a
[59:20] tradition. It's not a creed. But God's
[59:23] provided plan is the Bible. Therefore, I
[59:26] believe any word that's added to this
[59:27] Bible, whoever is guilty of doing it,
[59:30] his part will be taken out of the book
[59:32] of life. He said, I do not believe that
[59:35] any creed, any dogma, anything else,
[59:37] Amen. But just the literal word of God
[59:41] is God's plan. Anything else is sinful
[59:44] and will be dealt with and we will be
[59:46] eternally losy. Amen. Any creed, any
[59:49] man, any denomination that will add to
[59:52] or take away. Amen. from one punctuation
[59:55] of this word. Listen, I don't believe
[59:57] the Bible is just another book. Amen. I
[1:00:00] don't believe the Bible is just a good
[1:00:02] book to read when you don't feel good.
[1:00:04] But I believe the Bible is the mind of
[1:00:06] God. I believe it's the word of God. I I
[1:00:09] believe it's the promises of God. I
[1:00:11] believe it's the plan of God. And I
[1:00:13] believe you are the people who God has
[1:00:16] ordained to believe what he laid out in
[1:00:18] his plan in the hour that you're living
[1:00:20] in. You all know in Matthew 4 that Jesus
[1:00:23] said that man shall not live by bread
[1:00:25] alone. Right? Amen. But by every word
[1:00:28] that proceedth out of the mouth of God.
[1:00:30] Brother Ram come along and said the
[1:00:32] bread that we need is in the Bible. It's
[1:00:35] the complete revelation of God's plan.
[1:00:38] It's the complete revelation of Jesus
[1:00:41] Christ. Amen. I'll just give you a
[1:00:43] little disclaimer. If you don't like
[1:00:44] your Bible, you're going to be in a
[1:00:45] bumpy next 10 minutes. Amen. Because the
[1:00:47] prophet of God said, he said, "What is
[1:00:49] the Bible?" He said it's the very
[1:00:52] thoughts of God that he had before the
[1:00:55] foundation of the world. He expressed
[1:00:57] them in word and dropped them down to
[1:01:00] the prophets and they wrote them and the
[1:01:03] only thing it is it just has to unfold
[1:01:06] in the first seal. He said you see the
[1:01:08] book actually was planned and was
[1:01:11] written before the foundation of the
[1:01:13] world. Hallelujah. This book was not
[1:01:16] written when Moses stepped up on the
[1:01:18] earth. It was not written when David
[1:01:20] went out to meet Goliath. It was not
[1:01:22] written when Paul was on his road to
[1:01:24] Damascus. But this Bible was actually
[1:01:26] written from before the foundation of
[1:01:29] the world. And the only thing that's
[1:01:31] happening now is God is revealing or
[1:01:34] unfolding what he wrote before the
[1:01:36] foundation of the world. Listen, we're
[1:01:38] not a bunch of cultist people. We are
[1:01:40] children of the book. Amen. We are
[1:01:42] people of the Bible. If the Bible said
[1:01:44] it, we believe it. If the Bible teaches
[1:01:46] it, we stand on it. And if the Bible
[1:01:49] condemns it, we condemn it because we're
[1:01:51] not just another church. We're not here
[1:01:54] just trying to fill up a building and
[1:01:55] see who can be who and who can do what.
[1:01:58] We are here to be overcomers in the age
[1:02:01] of Leosa. Listen, there's a rapture
[1:02:03] coming. There's a body change coming.
[1:02:06] There's a future homecoming. There's a
[1:02:08] millennium coming. And there's only one
[1:02:10] way to get there. You won't get there by
[1:02:12] my idea, Matt's idea, or any other
[1:02:14] preachers's idea. You're only going to
[1:02:16] get there by the road map, which is the
[1:02:19] Bible.
[1:02:20] &gt;&gt; I say thank God for the Bible. I say
[1:02:23] thank God for the Bible. Amen. The Bible
[1:02:26] was really written before the foundation
[1:02:29] of the world. Listen, the Bible's a love
[1:02:32] story. Brother Re said the Bible is a
[1:02:34] prophet. He said the Bible is a history
[1:02:36] book. He said it's not man's book. It's
[1:02:40] God's book. Can we say that together?
[1:02:42] It's God's book.
[1:02:44] &gt;&gt; Amen. You want God's book, you're
[1:02:46] holding it.
[1:02:46] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:02:47] &gt;&gt; Let me say this. In the hour we're
[1:02:48] living, there's over 900 different
[1:02:51] denominations. Y'all know that.
[1:02:53] &gt;&gt; Now, I'll just say that was back in the
[1:02:54] days of Brother Brandham. Imagine how
[1:02:56] many there is today.
[1:02:58] &gt;&gt; Now, listen. And each one has their own
[1:03:01] statement of faith.
[1:03:02] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:03:03] &gt;&gt; But I love the fact that God sent a
[1:03:05] prophet in this hour.
[1:03:06] &gt;&gt; And he gave the bride church universally
[1:03:10] a beautiful statement of faith. Amen. It
[1:03:13] didn't come from headquarters. It didn't
[1:03:15] come from the general counsel. Here was
[1:03:17] the general statement of faith from a
[1:03:19] prophet. We have no creed but Christ.
[1:03:22] &gt;&gt; We have no law but love and we have no
[1:03:26] book but the Bible. He said, "I believe
[1:03:28] the Bible. I believe every word of it."
[1:03:31] &gt;&gt; He said, "I believe the Bible
[1:03:33] infallibly." He said, "I believe it's
[1:03:35] the infallible word of God." Then listen
[1:03:38] this morning. You are the bride of
[1:03:40] Christ. And I'll tell you, this bride is
[1:03:42] a Bible bride. She is not a man-made
[1:03:44] bride, but she is a Bible bride, which
[1:03:47] is a word bride because the word is
[1:03:51] living in her. And the word is not dead.
[1:03:54] It's an action. Amen. I'll ask you this
[1:03:56] morning just a general question. How
[1:03:58] many's ever heard the phrase around the
[1:04:00] message of the hour? Amen. The open
[1:04:02] book. How many's ever heard that? Amen.
[1:04:04] Be honest. Let me see your hands. The
[1:04:05] open book. Amen. You ever heard people
[1:04:07] say uh that we are a people of the open
[1:04:10] book? Amen. Or or they'll say things
[1:04:12] like this. We're living in the hour of
[1:04:14] the opening of the word. Now, I want to
[1:04:16] say something to you. Amen. Those are
[1:04:18] more than phrases, folks. Amen. Those
[1:04:21] are more than just little cliches that
[1:04:22] we say. Amen. To separate us from the
[1:04:25] church down the road. Amen. Those are
[1:04:27] scriptures fulfilled in the hour that
[1:04:30] we're living in. Amen. I'll tell you
[1:04:32] where it's coming from. Amen. It's
[1:04:34] coming from the book of Revelation.
[1:04:35] Okay? which you all know the prophet
[1:04:37] said that the book of Revelation, the
[1:04:39] last book in the Bible, he said is a
[1:04:42] book of symbols, right? Amen. And you
[1:04:44] can't even get through the first chapter
[1:04:46] without probably reading 20 symbols.
[1:04:48] Amen. So from Revelation 1 to Revelation
[1:04:51] 22, it's a book of symbols, which means
[1:04:54] it's a prophetic book, which means it's
[1:04:57] only to a prophetic class of people.
[1:05:00] Amen. Then this morning, you're not just
[1:05:02] church members. Amen. But you are a
[1:05:04] prophetic class of people. In Revelation
[1:05:07] 5, y'all like your Bibles. Revelation 5.
[1:05:09] You, if you listen to the read, you
[1:05:10] know, brother, read this. He said, "I
[1:05:12] saw in the right hand of him that sat on
[1:05:15] the throne a book written within and on
[1:05:18] the backside," Amen. was sealed with
[1:05:20] seven seals. And I saw a strong angel
[1:05:23] proclaiming with a loud voice, "Who is
[1:05:25] worthy to open the book and to loose the
[1:05:29] seals thereof? And no man in heaven, nor
[1:05:32] in earth, neither under the earth, was
[1:05:34] able to open the book, neither to look
[1:05:36] there. Now, how many's ever heard
[1:05:38] brother stop and say this, what a book.
[1:05:41] Amen. What a book. See, he said, and
[1:05:43] John says, I wept much because no man
[1:05:46] was found worthy, amen, to open and to
[1:05:49] read the book, amen, neither to look
[1:05:51] there. Said John was not weeping, amen,
[1:05:55] because he was not worthy. He was
[1:05:57] weeping because if the book of
[1:05:59] redemption did not come open then
[1:06:02] everything was lost. He said now see I
[1:06:04] love what he said. He said his crying
[1:06:07] didn't last long though. Amen. Just a
[1:06:10] minute. Amen. I could preach there for
[1:06:12] 30 minutes. Amen. Weeping may endure for
[1:06:14] the night. Amen. But joy is coming in
[1:06:17] the morning. You all know the Bible said
[1:06:20] God has no greater joy than to know his
[1:06:22] children are walking on the earth in
[1:06:25] truth. A prophet prophesied, I see great
[1:06:28] joys laying ahead for the church.
[1:06:30] Listen, if you got an old sad spirit on
[1:06:32] you this morning, you ought to shake
[1:06:34] that thing back in the hell it come out
[1:06:36] of and stand up on your God-given
[1:06:38] rights. We didn't come here to beg for
[1:06:40] joy, to pump up joy, to work up joy. The
[1:06:43] word has come open. And when the book
[1:06:46] come open, it's joy unspeakable. And
[1:06:48] it's full of glory. It's full of peace.
[1:06:51] It's full of power. It's full of
[1:06:53] reality. One of the elders saith unto
[1:06:56] me, "Weep not." Amen. For behold, the
[1:06:58] line of the tribe of Judah, the root of
[1:07:00] David, hath prevailed. Amen. To open the
[1:07:04] book, and to loose the seven seals
[1:07:06] thereof. Now, in Revelation five, amen,
[1:07:09] this book is closed. But in Revelation
[1:07:12] 10, brother Ram said, "I saw another
[1:07:14] mighty angel come down from heaven, and
[1:07:17] he was clothed with a cloud, and a
[1:07:20] rainbow was upon his head, and his faces
[1:07:22] it were the sun, and his feet as pillars
[1:07:24] of fire." If you want to see what I'm
[1:07:26] talking about, when you walk out the
[1:07:28] door this morning, look up on the wall,
[1:07:30] and you will see the cloud that appeared
[1:07:32] over Sunset Mountain. Look what it says
[1:07:34] in verse two. And he had in his hand a
[1:07:38] little book, but it was open. In
[1:07:41] Revelation 5, brother David Paul, it was
[1:07:44] closed. But in Revelation 10, the book
[1:07:46] is open. And he set his right foot up on
[1:07:48] the sea and his left foot up on the
[1:07:50] earth. Brother said, "This was a sealed
[1:07:53] book. It was sealed with seven seals."
[1:07:55] He said, "The book is the Bible." He
[1:07:58] said, "There's no man can open this
[1:08:00] word. We can pull the pages back, but to
[1:08:03] open it, it takes the Holy Spirit."
[1:08:05] Amen. Man cannot do it. See? Amen.
[1:08:08] That's not our ability. So it takes more
[1:08:11] than human ability to open the book. It
[1:08:14] takes divine ability. And listen at a
[1:08:17] prophet he said John saw the Bible
[1:08:20] laying in heaven. And he said there was
[1:08:22] no man in heaven nor on the earth or
[1:08:25] beneath the earth that could open the
[1:08:27] book or loose the seals. He said, "Now
[1:08:29] remember the Bible, Amen, was taken out
[1:08:32] of the hand of God." Amen. Sitting on
[1:08:35] his throne. Amen. I want to say this
[1:08:37] this morning. The Bible was not written
[1:08:39] by commentators. The Bible was written
[1:08:42] by inspiration and it was given by
[1:08:45] divine inspiration. Paul told Timothy,
[1:08:48] he said, "All scripture is given." I
[1:08:50] love that. All scripture is given. Amen.
[1:08:53] By inspiration of God, amen, it is
[1:08:55] profitable for doctrine, for reproof,
[1:08:57] for correction, and for instruction in
[1:08:59] righteousness, that the man of God may
[1:09:02] be perfect. Amen. Thoroughly finished
[1:09:04] and unto all good works. Amen. that
[1:09:07] every word of God is written is
[1:09:09] inspiration and it hooks the whole Bible
[1:09:11] together. It's the most wonderful book
[1:09:14] that was ever written. There's never a
[1:09:16] piece of literature ever written like
[1:09:18] the Bible. It's the only book in
[1:09:20] existence that tells you where you come
[1:09:22] from, tells you who you are, and tells
[1:09:25] you where you're going. He said, "We've
[1:09:27] got libraries full. We've got streets
[1:09:29] full and book rooms full. But never one
[1:09:31] of them, none of them, none of their
[1:09:33] great philosophers that's raised and
[1:09:35] fallen has ever been able to tell us
[1:09:37] what the Bible has told us. And all true
[1:09:40] science, amen, moves right back into the
[1:09:43] Bible. Amen. For its evidence. Amen.
[1:09:46] I'll say what a prophet said. He said,
[1:09:47] "The Holy Spirit wrote the Bible." And
[1:09:50] the Holy Spirit is the only one who can
[1:09:53] interpret the Bible, and he will give it
[1:09:55] to us as we have need. Amen. I'll say it
[1:09:59] like a prophet said. He said, "The
[1:10:01] entire Bible is set up on Revelation."
[1:10:04] Amen. The best part of the Bible, he
[1:10:06] said, is wrote between the lines. Y'all,
[1:10:08] y'all remember he said, "My wife writes
[1:10:10] me a love letter." He said, "I'm miles
[1:10:12] away from home." And he said, "She'll
[1:10:14] say, I just put Joseph to bed and Billy,
[1:10:16] Paul, and Sharon, she he said, "I'll
[1:10:18] read that." He said, "But really, I can
[1:10:20] read between the lines." And he said,
[1:10:22] "The message is between the lines." He
[1:10:25] said, "Now see, it's not all together
[1:10:27] right on the letter, but it's between
[1:10:29] the lines. So you've got the word."
[1:10:32] Amen. But you're looking for the meaning
[1:10:34] or the revelation behind what's being
[1:10:36] said. He said, "See, Amen. There's no
[1:10:39] man can open the book to understanding
[1:10:42] except Christ himself." The Holy Spirit
[1:10:45] hid those mysteries in there and all the
[1:10:47] Bible schools and seminaries will never
[1:10:50] be able to pull it out. He said, "God
[1:10:53] knows it alone." and will reveal it to
[1:10:55] who he will reveal it to. Amen. Can I
[1:10:58] can I close this point by saying this?
[1:11:01] Amen. The Bible was wrote by the pillar
[1:11:03] of fire. And we have had a vindicated
[1:11:05] prophet in the last days stand up on the
[1:11:08] platform and say, "The same pillar of
[1:11:10] fire that was here while the Bible was
[1:11:12] being wrote is the same pillar of fire
[1:11:15] that is here today interpreting what was
[1:11:18] wrote back there." What is it, folks?
[1:11:20] It's the message of the hour. We're not
[1:11:22] just a first pull church. We're not just
[1:11:25] a second pull church. We are a third
[1:11:27] pull church. Which means we believe in
[1:11:30] the unsealing or the opening of the
[1:11:32] book. We want more than just healings.
[1:11:35] We want more than just gifts. We want
[1:11:37] more than just prophecies. We want the
[1:11:39] word. We want the authority of the word.
[1:11:42] The Bible said, "Heaven and earth shall
[1:11:43] pass away, but my word shall never pass
[1:11:46] away." Listen, you're not a gift bride.
[1:11:48] You're not a sensation bride. You're not
[1:11:51] an emotional bride. You are a wordborn
[1:11:53] Bible believing Holy Ghost filled pillar
[1:11:56] of fire following William Brandon
[1:11:58] quoting church of the living God.
[1:12:00] Because we got more than a Bible
[1:12:02] education. We got more than a Bible
[1:12:04] intellectual conception. We got a
[1:12:06] revelation in the depths of our soul
[1:12:09] that this book told me where I come
[1:12:11] from.
[1:12:12] &gt;&gt; It told me where I'm at and it tells me
[1:12:15] where I'm going. You say, "What is it,
[1:12:17] Brother Andrew?" The third pull is the
[1:12:20] opening of the word.
[1:12:21] &gt;&gt; Can we just get that out there? The
[1:12:23] third pull is the opening of the word.
[1:12:26] It's the unsealing of the book.
[1:12:28] &gt;&gt; Brother Brandon said, "See, the third
[1:12:30] pull was the opening of them seven seals
[1:12:33] to reveal the hidden truth that's been
[1:12:36] sealed in the word." So, there were love
[1:12:39] secrets that were hid inside the word.
[1:12:42] Amen. Now, you all know this. study the
[1:12:44] message that brother Bram said that the
[1:12:46] book of revelation has a book in the Old
[1:12:48] Testament and he said it's called the
[1:12:50] book of Daniel. He said Daniel of the
[1:12:52] Old Testament is revelation of the new.
[1:12:55] He said now look here in Daniel 12.
[1:12:57] Y'all want to can you put that up?
[1:12:58] Daniel 12 and 4. Amen. The Bible says
[1:13:01] this. But thou, oh Daniel, shut up the
[1:13:03] words and seal the book even to the time
[1:13:06] of the end. For many shall run to and
[1:13:08] fro and knowledge shall be increased.
[1:13:11] Verse five. Then I, Daniel, looked, and
[1:13:13] behold, there stood other two, the one
[1:13:15] on the side of the bank of the river,
[1:13:17] and the other on the other side of the
[1:13:18] bank of the river. And one said to the
[1:13:20] man clothed in linen, which was upon the
[1:13:22] waters of the river, "How long shall it
[1:13:25] be to the end of these wonders? How long
[1:13:28] are we going to have to wonder? How long
[1:13:31] are we going to have to presume and
[1:13:32] probe and guess and try to consult with
[1:13:34] this one and look through this?" Amen.
[1:13:36] But I heard the man clothe the linen.
[1:13:38] Brother said that was the Holy Spirit
[1:13:40] which was upon the waters. He said which
[1:13:42] was peoples and multitudes. He said of
[1:13:45] the river when he held up his right hand
[1:13:47] and his left hand unto heaven and swear
[1:13:49] by him that liveth forever that it shall
[1:13:52] be for a time times and a half and when
[1:13:55] he shall have brother said he. Amen.
[1:13:57] That's a personal pronoun. He said
[1:14:00] that's the antichrist. Amen. Accompass
[1:14:02] to scatter the power of the holy people.
[1:14:05] That's when he breaks his covenant in
[1:14:07] the middle of the week. He said, "All
[1:14:09] these things shall be finished." Amen.
[1:14:12] So, at the same time that the son of
[1:14:14] predition or the antichrist is being
[1:14:17] revealed and is scattering the power of
[1:14:19] the holy people, the prophet of God
[1:14:21] announces, Revelation 10:7 is being
[1:14:24] fulfilled in the days of the voice of
[1:14:27] the seventh angel. When he shall begin
[1:14:29] to sound, the mystery of God should be
[1:14:32] finished. You say, "What is the mystery
[1:14:34] of God?" The prophet of God said, "It's
[1:14:36] God in you, the hope of glory shining
[1:14:40] forth the baptism of the Holy Ghost."
[1:14:42] Oh, Grace tabernacle, don't you know
[1:14:44] what I'm talking about? You're not just
[1:14:46] a church. You're not just a people. You
[1:14:49] are the revelation of the revealing of
[1:14:51] the mystery of God in the hour that
[1:14:53] we're living in. Listen, I'm not looking
[1:14:55] for the Holy Ghost. I'm looking at the
[1:14:58] Holy Ghost. You say, "I'm not the Holy
[1:15:00] Ghost." You're exactly right. But
[1:15:02] underneath that redeemed badger skin is
[1:15:05] dwelling the power of God in the form of
[1:15:07] the baptism of the Holy Ghost. Listen,
[1:15:09] the devil can only do as much as you let
[1:15:11] him. The devil can only get away with as
[1:15:13] much as you let him. The devil can only
[1:15:15] drive you as far as you let him stay in
[1:15:17] the driver's seat. But somewhere you got
[1:15:19] to get a hold of yourself and get a hold
[1:15:22] of a revelation that I have come from
[1:15:24] God. I got a seed in my soul. I'm going
[1:15:26] back to God. There ain't nothing the
[1:15:28] devil can do. The book has already been
[1:15:31] opened.
[1:15:32] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:15:34] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[1:15:35] &gt;&gt; Amen. Let's go on to verse eight. And I
[1:15:37] heard
[1:15:38] &gt;&gt; but I understood not.
[1:15:40] &gt;&gt; You know a good evidence you can
[1:15:42] understand is when you can say what
[1:15:43] you're hearing.
[1:15:44] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:15:45] &gt;&gt; Then said I, oh my Lord, what shall be
[1:15:48] the end of these things? And he said, go
[1:15:50] thy way, Daniel, for the words are
[1:15:53] closed up. Come on, man.
[1:15:54] &gt;&gt; Come on.
[1:15:55] The words are closed up and they are
[1:15:58] sealed until the time of the end. For
[1:16:01] many shall be purified and made white
[1:16:04] and tried, but the wicked shall do
[1:16:06] wickedly.
[1:16:07] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:16:08] &gt;&gt; And none of the wicked shall understand.
[1:16:11] &gt;&gt; But here's you.
[1:16:12] &gt;&gt; But the wise, brother Roy, but the wise
[1:16:15] shall understand. You know what a
[1:16:17] prophet said? He said the church is
[1:16:19] going to become more churchy. He said
[1:16:21] the wicked are going to come more
[1:16:23] wicked. He said, "But the saints are
[1:16:25] going to come closer to God." Brother
[1:16:27] said, "The end time message shall reveal
[1:16:29] it." Amen. The last church age, he said,
[1:16:32] "The mystery, the things that the church
[1:16:34] will pass their eyes and says it's
[1:16:36] nonsense. The mystery of who Jesus
[1:16:38] Christ was." Amen. The person of God and
[1:16:41] all these other mysteries will be
[1:16:43] revealed because it's wrote here in this
[1:16:46] book and to be revealed in the end time
[1:16:49] generation. He said, "No wonder they
[1:16:52] can't understand why you don't cluck up
[1:16:54] with them because there's a power and
[1:16:57] there's a vision behind it." Amen. A
[1:16:59] word of God that's been revealed to get
[1:17:02] the church in order for the rapture for
[1:17:05] the going home. Well, somebody shout,
[1:17:06] "We're going home." Brother Joel, we're
[1:17:09] not going to another church age. We're
[1:17:11] not going to another dispensation. The
[1:17:13] opening of the book has put the church
[1:17:15] in rapture order. And one of these
[1:17:18] mornings, we're not looking for a
[1:17:20] prophet to come back. We're not looking
[1:17:22] for the revelation. We're not looking
[1:17:23] for a vision. We're not looking for
[1:17:25] power. We are in divine possession this
[1:17:28] morning of the power of God that'll
[1:17:30] change our bodies some morning.
[1:17:33] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. If I was the devil, I'd
[1:17:35] fight every bride member two because
[1:17:37] you're not looking for something. You're
[1:17:39] looking at something.
[1:17:41] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. I love what John said. He
[1:17:43] said, "Blessed is he that readeth." Is
[1:17:45] it okay just to preach a little bit?
[1:17:46] Blessed is he that readeth, and they
[1:17:48] that hear the words of this prophecy,
[1:17:50] and keep those things which are written
[1:17:52] therein. Listen what he said. Revelation
[1:17:54] 1:3, for the time is at hand. In Daniel
[1:17:58] 12, seal it up. Amen. In the Old
[1:18:01] Testament, seal it up, but the time is
[1:18:03] at hand. Brother said, you want a
[1:18:05] blessing? He said, just read it. Amen.
[1:18:08] The seven seal book will listen to the
[1:18:11] prophet. He said, the seven seal roll
[1:18:14] book. Hallelujah.
[1:18:16] &gt;&gt; I can't help but preach, brother Brian.
[1:18:18] Amen. God took role and I was accounted
[1:18:20] for.
[1:18:22] &gt;&gt; Come on. Y'all know what I'm talking
[1:18:24] about. Amen. I went to a private
[1:18:25] Christian school and the way they took
[1:18:27] role was you sat down in your seat. And
[1:18:30] now school started at 7:30, but you were
[1:18:32] not tardy until roll was taken. So,
[1:18:35] amen. We always knew that one teacher
[1:18:37] sitting there and drink coffee till
[1:18:38] about 8 o'clock. So, we had time. You
[1:18:40] people been Tennessee. We had time to go
[1:18:42] by pals and get a coffee and get a tea
[1:18:44] and I got to keep on preaching.
[1:18:47] &gt;&gt; But when she called ro, you better be
[1:18:50] sitting in your chair. And you know how
[1:18:52] you answered attendance, you didn't say,
[1:18:54] "Here, you read a scripture." Amen. Can
[1:18:57] I tell you this? God took Ro, folks, and
[1:19:00] when he checked if you were there, he
[1:19:02] didn't see how many degrees you had, how
[1:19:04] well you could quote the Bible, how
[1:19:06] strong you were in memorization of
[1:19:07] quotes. He just looking for you to say
[1:19:10] that ain't nothing but the truth. Amen.
[1:19:12] Everything that was spoken, there was a
[1:19:14] program response on the inside of the
[1:19:17] soul of a believer. We're not a bunch of
[1:19:19] chickens. We're eagles. We cannot
[1:19:22] up with denomination. We cannot sack up
[1:19:25] with traditional ideas. We must have the
[1:19:27] bread of his presence, which is the
[1:19:29] revelation of Jesus Christ.
[1:19:32] &gt;&gt; He said the complete word is now
[1:19:35] revealed in these seven mysteries. Amen.
[1:19:38] He said, "Then what is it? What is the
[1:19:40] opening the seals?" Then it's revealing
[1:19:42] Christ. Amen. What is Christ? He is the
[1:19:45] anointing. He is the anointed word. Oh,
[1:19:48] the prophet read it. Very beautiful. And
[1:19:50] the yoke shall be destroyed.
[1:19:54] &gt;&gt; Because of the anointing, he said, "Now
[1:19:58] see, amen. If you're living way down
[1:20:01] here and you're still holding that
[1:20:03] organization," he said, "Now look, it's
[1:20:05] time to move up." He said it's time to
[1:20:08] examine our lives by the word. He said
[1:20:10] we ought to live above the short hair
[1:20:12] and all this age now. He said we're into
[1:20:15] something now that God's revealing the
[1:20:18] hidden mysteries that's been put on the
[1:20:20] book before the foundation of the world.
[1:20:23] And those who have obeyed in these small
[1:20:26] things will catch it in these other
[1:20:28] things. Amen. If you can obey in the
[1:20:31] small things, then you will catch the
[1:20:34] revelation in the greater things. Amen.
[1:20:36] I love it because this morning we're not
[1:20:39] here, Amen. reading our Bibles and
[1:20:41] praying and sec and and setting
[1:20:43] ourselves aside and and consecrating
[1:20:45] ourselves. Amen. Just to try to get an
[1:20:47] audience with the preacher or or to get
[1:20:49] an audience with the pastor. Amen. But I
[1:20:51] believe this morning as believers, amen,
[1:20:54] we want an audience with God. Amen. And
[1:20:56] I'll say this, to have an audience with
[1:20:58] someone, it means to have a formal
[1:21:01] meeting. It means to have a formal
[1:21:04] meeting, amen, with a person of high
[1:21:07] status or importance. Amen. So if you
[1:21:09] get an audience with somebody, amen,
[1:21:12] they are of importance, they're of high
[1:21:14] status, they're a valuable person. Come
[1:21:16] on. You know, you don't go down here if
[1:21:18] you're trying to get a job with some CEO
[1:21:20] or some corporation. Amen. You don't
[1:21:22] walk in there in your worst clothes.
[1:21:25] Amen. Saying your slang and sitting down
[1:21:27] in the chair and saying, "Yo, boss,
[1:21:29] what's up?" Amen. you got any room for
[1:21:31] me on the job? No, you go to a training
[1:21:34] session and they train you on how to
[1:21:38] approach the boss because you're trying
[1:21:40] to create a desired result and the
[1:21:43] result is what you want is the job. Can
[1:21:46] I say something to you? Amen. There's
[1:21:48] many people could dress right. Amen.
[1:21:50] They could look right. They had all the
[1:21:52] education. But when they went in there
[1:21:54] and sat down with the boss, they didn't
[1:21:56] know what to say. Amen. They tried to
[1:21:58] say this and say that and they did not
[1:22:00] get the result they were looking for.
[1:22:02] Oh, come on, church. A prophet of God
[1:22:05] said, "We everyone have a right to have
[1:22:07] an audience with Jesus Christ right
[1:22:10] now." Amen. I'll say this. The Jesus
[1:22:12] Christ I'm talking about, Amen. is not
[1:22:15] the second person. He's not the third
[1:22:17] person. He is the only person. As a
[1:22:19] matter of fact, Brother Joel, Amen. He
[1:22:21] is the King of Kings. He is the Lord of
[1:22:24] Lords.
[1:22:25] &gt;&gt; Can I preach to you? Can I tell you what
[1:22:27] he is? He is the high priest. Amen. I'll
[1:22:30] tell you this. We're not approaching the
[1:22:31] priest. We're not approaching a prophet.
[1:22:33] We're approaching the high priest. The
[1:22:35] prophet of God said that's what he was.
[1:22:37] He that was, that's Jesus the prophet.
[1:22:40] He that is, that is the high priest.
[1:22:42] Amen. Making intercession. He is one who
[1:22:45] can be touched with the feeling of our
[1:22:47] infirmities. Amen. Brother said, "Now
[1:22:49] we're not presuming anything. We see
[1:22:52] it." How many can say, "I see it."
[1:22:54] &gt;&gt; Amen. We see it and we know that God is
[1:22:57] here. The Holy Spirit, the great God of
[1:23:00] Elijah, the Holy Ghost, the witness of
[1:23:02] the last day is pulling his ministry
[1:23:06] right into the church. Amen. The same
[1:23:08] thing that our Lord did. Now, now catch
[1:23:11] what a prophet says. He says, "The high
[1:23:13] priest is descending from the throne to
[1:23:16] the church." Amen. The high priest is
[1:23:19] descending from the throne into the
[1:23:22] church. And the church is heaping itself
[1:23:24] up with the word because he can only
[1:23:27] come to the word. He is the word. Amen.
[1:23:31] So if you're going to talk to the word,
[1:23:33] brother David, you got to speak the same
[1:23:35] language that the word speaks if you
[1:23:38] want to get an audience with him. Amen.
[1:23:40] If you want to get an audience with an
[1:23:41] astronaut, amen, you got to talk the
[1:23:43] same language that an astronaut talks.
[1:23:46] If you want to get an audience with a
[1:23:47] president, you I don't know what you got
[1:23:49] to say. Amen. But you got to be able to
[1:23:51] say something. Amen. To get his attent.
[1:23:53] Are you hearing me? Amen. If you want to
[1:23:55] get an audience with a doctor, amen. You
[1:23:57] can't go in there and give them all your
[1:23:59] homeopathic remedies and expect them to
[1:24:01] get an audience with them. Amen. You got
[1:24:03] to approach them under the l I just lost
[1:24:07] half the curt. Amen. You got to approach
[1:24:09] them under the language that they speak
[1:24:12] or you're not going to get an audience
[1:24:14] with them. What are you saying,
[1:24:16] preacher? I'm saying what Paul said in
[1:24:18] Hebrews 4. He said, "We have a great
[1:24:20] high priest." Amen. That is passed into
[1:24:23] heavens, Jesus the son of God. Then let
[1:24:26] us hold fast our profession. Brother
[1:24:29] said, "Now look, he is the high priest
[1:24:32] of our profession, which means
[1:24:34] confession." He said, "Now to profess
[1:24:36] and to confess, Amen. is the same
[1:24:39] thing." Amen. Confess means to say the
[1:24:43] same thing. Amen. By his stripes I am
[1:24:46] healed. Now it's by his life I am saved.
[1:24:49] He said now he now listen. He cannot do
[1:24:52] nothing for us till we already say that
[1:24:55] he's done it. Listen folks, he can't do
[1:24:58] one thing until we say he's already done
[1:25:02] it. Not till we read it. Not till we
[1:25:05] memorize it. Not till we can come on.
[1:25:08] But until we can say he's already done
[1:25:11] it. He said, "We have to confess it or
[1:25:14] profess it that he's done it." Listen,
[1:25:16] then he can go to work on it. Oh, come
[1:25:19] on. Some of you right now got babies
[1:25:21] running from God. Amen. Don't sit there
[1:25:24] and let the cat have your tongue. Open
[1:25:26] up your mouth as a powerful Bible bride
[1:25:29] and say, "My baby is saved. My son is
[1:25:32] coming home. My daughter is going to be
[1:25:34] restored." Listen. And when you say
[1:25:36] that, the power of God will drop on that
[1:25:38] confession and you will put the high
[1:25:40] priest into action.
[1:25:42] &gt;&gt; Well, we might as well have church. We
[1:25:44] drove all the way out here. I think it's
[1:25:46] time to quit sitting back and letting
[1:25:47] the devil run us around on the promises
[1:25:49] of God. I think it's time we get our
[1:25:51] mouth open with an open book and we stop
[1:25:54] saying wowy, wowy, wo, and poor pitiful
[1:25:57] me. I think it's time to say what a
[1:25:59] prophet has already said.
[1:26:03] You say, "Preacher, I don't know if I
[1:26:04] can say it." You know what Paul said? He
[1:26:06] said, "The kingdom of God is God's
[1:26:09] word."
[1:26:09] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:26:10] &gt;&gt; The kingdom of God is God's word. You
[1:26:13] know what a prophet said? He said,
[1:26:15] "God's word made power."
[1:26:17] &gt;&gt; Hey, hey, hey. And when the word comes
[1:26:20] in there, how does the word get in the
[1:26:23] church? The word gets in the church when
[1:26:25] the word comes open. When the word comes
[1:26:27] in there, what does this word begin?
[1:26:30] Listen, it turns itself into power.
[1:26:36] &gt;&gt; Come on. These are not like quotes,
[1:26:37] folks. Amen. When the word gets in the
[1:26:40] soul of the church,
[1:26:42] &gt;&gt; it turns itself into power
[1:26:46] &gt;&gt; and making it say just exactly what it
[1:26:50] said. Now, you can't say it's this and
[1:26:53] it says this and make it work.
[1:26:56] &gt;&gt; Now, come on. The word can't say you're
[1:26:58] healed and then you say, "Well, I'm too
[1:27:00] far gone." And the word work. Amen. The
[1:27:02] word can't say God can do the
[1:27:04] impossible. And then you say, "Well, I
[1:27:06] don't know. My child's in the worst way
[1:27:08] they've ever been." Amen. You got to say
[1:27:10] the same thing. If the word says you're
[1:27:13] healed, then your confession has got to
[1:27:15] be, "I'm healed." If the word says
[1:27:18] you're delivered, then your confession
[1:27:20] has got to be, "I'm delivered." If the
[1:27:22] word said you never done it in the first
[1:27:24] place, then your confession has got to
[1:27:27] quit being. I remember when I smoked it.
[1:27:29] I remember when I drank it. I remember
[1:27:31] when I went there. You got to lose that
[1:27:33] confession and get a hold of the
[1:27:36] confession of the word and say God don't
[1:27:38] remember it because he said he would not
[1:27:40] remember my iniquities.
[1:27:44] &gt;&gt; Well, somebody shout hallelujah. I'm
[1:27:46] talking about saying what the word says.
[1:27:49] You got to say the same thing it says.
[1:27:55] &gt;&gt; You know what that does? It makes it a
[1:27:58] confession.
[1:27:59] &gt;&gt; Not saying, "Well, it's polished up a
[1:28:02] little here. I'll have more wisdom. I'll
[1:28:05] be in a better standing over there." You
[1:28:08] stay with the word
[1:28:10] &gt;&gt; and it makes it power.
[1:28:12] &gt;&gt; Now look what Paul says. This Okay. He
[1:28:15] says, "For we have not a high priest
[1:28:18] which could not be touched with the
[1:28:20] feeling of our infirmities, but was in
[1:28:23] all points tempted like as we are, yet
[1:28:26] without sin." Verse 16. Let us therefore
[1:28:29] come weakly and beggarly and eag
[1:28:34] &gt;&gt; and meekly and barely holding on.
[1:28:37] Let us therefore come boldly
[1:28:44] &gt;&gt; unto the throne of gra. Come on. We need
[1:28:46] a boldness in our worship.
[1:28:48] &gt;&gt; We need a boldness in our prayer.
[1:28:50] &gt;&gt; We need a Come on. You say, "Well,
[1:28:52] boldness is noise." Amen. Boldness is
[1:28:54] not noise and volume. Boldness is power.
[1:28:57] &gt;&gt; Come on. Amen. If I could get up there
[1:28:59] and scream a prayer, God, I'd have
[1:29:00] boldness. Listen, there's people scream
[1:29:02] prayers and can't blow the fuzz off of a
[1:29:03] peach. Amen. But take a little
[1:29:05] housewife. that knows her position in
[1:29:07] the word of God and she looks at the
[1:29:09] devil and says, "Devil, you brought that
[1:29:11] fever upon my baby, but in the name of
[1:29:13] Jesus Christ, I take it off." Amen. She
[1:29:16] ain't got to scream the house down. She
[1:29:18] can stand up on the open book with a
[1:29:21] confession in her mouth.
[1:29:24] &gt;&gt; You got to come boldly into the throne
[1:29:25] of grace that we may obtain mercy and
[1:29:28] find grace to help in the time of need.
[1:29:31] Now, I know what you're thinking. This
[1:29:32] word boldly, brother Rusty. probably
[1:29:34] we're probably thinking it means to put
[1:29:35] on some marching shoes and kick doors
[1:29:37] out of the way. Amen. And come sit down
[1:29:39] and kick pews over. Amen. Knock the
[1:29:42] microphone stand over and I've done that
[1:29:44] a few times. And kick the speakers out
[1:29:46] of the way, brother. Brother, I'm coming
[1:29:48] bold. Amen. Amen. I'm coming bold,
[1:29:50] brother Connor. I'm coming bold,
[1:29:52] brother. Amen. That's not boldness. You
[1:29:54] know what Paul said? Come boldly. Look
[1:29:56] at this word boldly. It means freedom in
[1:29:58] speaking.
[1:29:59] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:30:01] &gt;&gt; Glory to God. It means an unreservedness
[1:30:04] in speech. It means openly and frankly.
[1:30:08] It means free and fearless confidence.
[1:30:12] It means cheerful and cold and courage
[1:30:15] and boldness. Amen. Can I say this to
[1:30:17] you tonight? This morning, we're not
[1:30:19] desiring, Amen, to come weak. We're not
[1:30:22] desiring to come meagerly and beggarly.
[1:30:24] We want to come boldly. Amen. I want to
[1:30:26] say this. We are desiring, Amen, an
[1:30:29] audience with a high priest. But we got
[1:30:31] to know what to say. Amen. We got to
[1:30:33] know what to say. Remember said this. He
[1:30:36] said, "You know, there's certain things
[1:30:37] we can say that takes a hold with the
[1:30:40] Holy Spirit. Just certain things that
[1:30:42] pleases him just right." I want you to
[1:30:45] notice Mark 11. What you say? If we
[1:30:48] could just find what to say. If we could
[1:30:52] just find what to say, your words judge
[1:30:55] you or condemn you or will bless you.
[1:30:58] You know what? You know what? What David
[1:31:00] said in Psalms 81:10, he says, "I am the
[1:31:03] Lord thy God, which brought thee out of
[1:31:05] the land of Egypt." Now look here, "Open
[1:31:08] thy mouth wide."
[1:31:12] &gt;&gt; I think probably everybody here could do
[1:31:14] that this morning, but brother Kobe,
[1:31:15] bless his heart, had them wisdom teeth
[1:31:16] cut out.
[1:31:17] &gt;&gt; Open thy mouth wide and I will feel it.
[1:31:22] &gt;&gt; So that tells me, oh God, that he's
[1:31:25] going to put something in there that a
[1:31:27] small mouth can't handle.
[1:31:30] He's going to put something in there
[1:31:31] that you can't just be a little small
[1:31:33] mouth Christian. Well, amen. I just
[1:31:35] trying to get by. I I just joined the
[1:31:38] church. No, he's going to put something
[1:31:39] in there. He's going to put the
[1:31:41] revelation of the bread of his word in
[1:31:44] your mouth. And it's going to become
[1:31:45] more than just a quote. It's going to
[1:31:47] become more than just a scripture. It's
[1:31:49] going to become a confession. It's going
[1:31:51] to become a profession. It's going to
[1:31:53] become a sword in the mouth of a
[1:31:56] believer. Listen, you're not going to
[1:31:57] fight flesh and blood, but with the
[1:31:59] sword of the spirit, which is the word
[1:32:02] in your mouth, you're going to tear down
[1:32:04] the enemy's kingdom, you're going to
[1:32:05] break the strongholds of the unbelieving
[1:32:07] spirits.
[1:32:10] &gt;&gt; Open thy mouth wide.
[1:32:13] &gt;&gt; And I will feel it. Which means you
[1:32:15] can't just eat twice a week.
[1:32:18] &gt;&gt; Now, I know I know
[1:32:20] &gt;&gt; I get to talking like this and that
[1:32:21] spirit of condemnation starts settling
[1:32:23] in the building.
[1:32:24] Well, I ain't got a right to say nothing
[1:32:27] and I don't know what to do. Well, well,
[1:32:29] let's go to Exodus 3:13. Is that okay?
[1:32:32] &gt;&gt; And Moses said unto God, "Behold, when I
[1:32:35] come into the children of Israel, and
[1:32:37] shall say unto them, the God of your
[1:32:40] fathers has sent me unto you, and they
[1:32:43] shall say to me, what is his name? What
[1:32:47] shall I say unto them?" Amen.
[1:32:51] &gt;&gt; What shall I say unto them? And God said
[1:32:54] unto Moses,
[1:32:56] tell them
[1:32:59] you got a DD and a PhD
[1:33:02] &gt;&gt; and tell them you were.
[1:33:05] &gt;&gt; Come on. Tell them I am that I am.
[1:33:09] &gt;&gt; Brother, you talking about a mouthful. I
[1:33:12] am that I am. And he said, "Thus shall
[1:33:15] thou say unto the children of Israel, I
[1:33:19] am hath sent me unto you." Listen. He
[1:33:22] goes on in Exodus 4:10, "And Moses said
[1:33:24] unto the Lord, oh my Lord." Now, now
[1:33:26] come on. Amen. God, brother Brian, has
[1:33:29] already supplied what to say. He's
[1:33:32] already told Moses. Amen. When they ask
[1:33:35] you who you are and what you're doing
[1:33:37] here and what authority you have to do
[1:33:39] the things you're doing, he said, "Look
[1:33:41] at him and say, the I am
[1:33:44] &gt;&gt; that I am has sent me unto you." Now
[1:33:47] listen and look what what Moses said in
[1:33:49] chapter 4 and verse 10. Oh Lord, I am
[1:33:51] not eloquent. Amen. Neither henceforth
[1:33:54] nor has I spoken of thy servant, but
[1:33:57] Lord, I'm slow of speech and of a slow
[1:34:00] tongue. Lord, that's a mouthful.
[1:34:03] Amen. I struggle with some words. That's
[1:34:05] a mouthful. Amen. I don't know what to
[1:34:07] say. I don't know how to say it. But
[1:34:09] watch what he said. Amen. The Lord said
[1:34:11] unto him, "Who hath made the man's
[1:34:13] mouth? And who maketh the dumb or the
[1:34:15] dead or the seen of the blind? Have not
[1:34:17] I the Lord? Now therefore go and I will
[1:34:21] be with thy mouth."
[1:34:24] &gt;&gt; Can I finish the rest of it? And I will
[1:34:27] teach thee what thou shalt say. Brother
[1:34:30] said it beautiful. He said he couldn't
[1:34:32] speak. Well, you know what God said? He
[1:34:34] said, "That's okay. I'll heal him of
[1:34:36] it."
[1:34:37] &gt;&gt; Glory to God. Amen. You know how Moses
[1:34:40] got healing was when he stepped into his
[1:34:43] con.
[1:34:44] &gt;&gt; Glory to God. When he stepped into his
[1:34:47] commission and begin to say what the
[1:34:49] Lord put in his mouth.
[1:34:50] &gt;&gt; Glory to God. If he would have went down
[1:34:53] there and tried to tell him who he was,
[1:34:55] he would have stuttered and stammered
[1:34:56] and spit and got choked up on his words.
[1:34:59] But the Lord put some words in his
[1:35:00] mouth, said, "Go down there." And when
[1:35:02] they ask you who you are, I know you got
[1:35:04] a stutter. I know you got a stammered
[1:35:07] lips. But when you open your mouth and
[1:35:09] you I'm about to explode up here. When
[1:35:12] you open your mouth and begin to confess
[1:35:14] your commission by the confessing of
[1:35:17] your commission, I'm going to heal your
[1:35:19] speech impediment. Oh, glory to God. By
[1:35:22] the confession of who called you, by the
[1:35:25] confession of who positioned you, by the
[1:35:28] confession of who anointed you, I'm
[1:35:31] going to heal your insecurities. Oh,
[1:35:33] church of the living God. I believe
[1:35:35] there's a bomb in Gilead. I believe
[1:35:38] there's some healing in the building
[1:35:39] this morning.
[1:35:41] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. I believe right now, if
[1:35:43] you'll begin to confess, I'm an
[1:35:45] overcomer. Greater is he that is in me
[1:35:48] than he that is in the world. If God be
[1:35:50] for me, who can be against me? By his
[1:35:52] stripes, I am healed. You are a word
[1:35:55] bride, which means you have a word
[1:35:57] confession.
[1:35:59] &gt;&gt; Brother Wesley, when you begin to
[1:36:01] confess the word of your commission, it
[1:36:03] brings healing.
[1:36:07] &gt;&gt; You know, and don't get mad at me, but
[1:36:09] you know why some of y'all are
[1:36:11] spiritually sick? is because you can't
[1:36:13] turn loose of that negative condemnation
[1:36:16] of a confession
[1:36:18] &gt;&gt; and you stay spiritually sick.
[1:36:22] &gt;&gt; Listen, I ain't playing with that devil
[1:36:23] this morning.
[1:36:24] &gt;&gt; I'm not playing with that devil. It's
[1:36:26] time for some healing.
[1:36:29] &gt;&gt; It's time for some healing to come into
[1:36:31] the church. Amen. Quit saying what they
[1:36:33] said about you.
[1:36:36] &gt;&gt; Well, they said I was a failure and they
[1:36:37] said I wasn't going to amount to
[1:36:39] nothing. Amen. Who are they?
[1:36:41] &gt;&gt; Come on. You say they said, "I got a
[1:36:43] question. Who are they? Did they call
[1:36:45] you? Did they save you? Did they put
[1:36:47] your name on the Lamb's Book of Life?"
[1:36:49] They did not. So, they have no authority
[1:36:52] over your confession. But I'll tell you
[1:36:54] who has authority over your confession.
[1:36:56] Is the one that picked you up in the
[1:36:58] gutters. Is the one that healed you when
[1:37:00] you was on your deathbed. Is the one
[1:37:02] that gave you the Holy Ghost. Is the one
[1:37:04] that filled you with the dynamics of his
[1:37:06] spirit. Is the one that saved your
[1:37:08] babies. Is the one that gave you the
[1:37:09] blessings of God. I'll tell you who's
[1:37:11] got a right to confess is the sons and
[1:37:14] daughters of God. And by your
[1:37:16] confession, God will heal that old
[1:37:19] failure mentality.
[1:37:20] [Applause]
[1:37:25] &gt;&gt; I'll be with your mouth.
[1:37:30] &gt;&gt; I'll be with your mouth.
[1:37:37] &gt;&gt; Well, my mama was this and my daddy was
[1:37:39] at it. My grandpa was this and my
[1:37:40] grandma was that. My great grand
[1:37:44] &gt;&gt; God ain't going to heal you by that
[1:37:46] confession.
[1:37:49] &gt;&gt; You got to confess what the word says.
[1:37:52] &gt;&gt; See, now let me show you something. God
[1:37:55] spoke to Moses face to face.
[1:37:58] &gt;&gt; You know that.
[1:38:00] &gt;&gt; But that didn't heal him.
[1:38:03] He talked face to face with God
[1:38:08] &gt;&gt; and it didn't heal him.
[1:38:11] &gt;&gt; But then the prophet said God spoke lift
[1:38:13] to ear to Moses.
[1:38:16] &gt;&gt; And Moses went and said what God said
[1:38:18] lift to ear.
[1:38:21] &gt;&gt; Come on. Let me just cut to the chase
[1:38:22] and say it. The bride is the final voice
[1:38:26] &gt;&gt; under her messenger. She's the final
[1:38:28] voice to the final age. Look at Matthew
[1:38:31] 10:18. and ye shall be brought before
[1:38:33] governors and kings for my sake, for a
[1:38:36] testimony against them and the Gentiles.
[1:38:38] But when they deliver you up, take no
[1:38:41] thought how or what ye shall speak, for
[1:38:44] it shall be given you in the same hour.
[1:38:49] &gt;&gt; What ye shall speak,
[1:38:51] &gt;&gt; Sister Debbie, all scripture is given.
[1:38:54] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:38:55] &gt;&gt; Come on, folks. All scripture is given.
[1:38:58] And Jesus said, "Don't take no fault
[1:39:00] what you're going to say in the hour you
[1:39:02] have need." Oh God, I'll give you what
[1:39:05] to say. And it won't be some flimsy
[1:39:08] idea. It won't be some wimpy excuse.
[1:39:10] It'll be something from the unsealed
[1:39:12] book. It'll be something from the Bible.
[1:39:15] It'll be something from the word of God.
[1:39:18] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. You say, "You lost your
[1:39:20] mind." No, I haven't. It's the power of
[1:39:23] confessing the word.
[1:39:28] Look at this word given
[1:39:30] means to give over to someone. Now can I
[1:39:34] can I can I read verse 20?
[1:39:38] &gt;&gt; For it is not ye that speak.
[1:39:42] &gt;&gt; But the spirit of your father
[1:39:46] which speaketh in you.
[1:39:48] &gt;&gt; Look at this word speaketh. It means to
[1:39:50] use words in order to declare one's
[1:39:53] mind.
[1:39:55] It means to disclose
[1:39:57] one's thoughts. Notice this, brother
[1:40:00] David. Paul not speaketh to you.
[1:40:07] &gt;&gt; But speaketh in you.
[1:40:10] &gt;&gt; See, he's using your eyes and your lips.
[1:40:14] If you premeditate, then you're doing
[1:40:16] your own thinking.
[1:40:19] &gt;&gt; Come on, church. You all know there's
[1:40:21] been times that the spirit out of you.
[1:40:24] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[1:40:25] &gt;&gt; Come on. Y'all know Brother Wayne's
[1:40:27] testimony over there in India when the
[1:40:28] pictures was on the wall and they said
[1:40:30] you can't take them down and the woman
[1:40:32] fell dead in the floor with a demon
[1:40:34] possession or not. I don't know if she
[1:40:35] was dead or not, but she just fell over
[1:40:36] in the floor. And brother Wayne said, we
[1:40:38] went back to preaching and before I
[1:40:40] could pick up on my notes, I said, "If
[1:40:43] God is God that or how was it? If that
[1:40:45] woman don't get up out of the floor,
[1:40:47] God's not even God." He said, and when I
[1:40:49] said it, I closer my mouth. Amen. And he
[1:40:52] said this. He said, "Because God's God
[1:40:54] whether she gets up off the floor or
[1:40:56] not." He said, "But you know what
[1:40:58] happened was God brought a challenge to
[1:41:00] the gods of them religions and proved
[1:41:03] who he was." Now, come on, folks. He
[1:41:05] didn't come out of the heavens literally
[1:41:07] and speak it, but he picked up a piece
[1:41:09] of Arkansas dirt and sent him over to
[1:41:11] India and put him behind a pull pit and
[1:41:14] put a word in his mouth. Hallelujah. And
[1:41:17] defied the Hindu gods, old church of the
[1:41:20] living God. I want to say this. If God
[1:41:23] can do it through one, he can do it with
[1:41:25] another. If God can do it through
[1:41:27] Arkansas dirt, he can do it through
[1:41:29] Tennessee dirt. He can do it through
[1:41:30] Missouri dirt. He can do it through
[1:41:32] Virginia dirt because he's God. And he
[1:41:35] just needs somebody to get out of his
[1:41:37] way and open up their mouth and let him
[1:41:40] feel it.
[1:41:43] &gt;&gt; He'll give you the words to say.
[1:41:47] &gt;&gt; You say, "Preacher, you lost your mind."
[1:41:49] I haven't lost my mind. If you're
[1:41:51] willing to be the lamb, he'll be the
[1:41:53] dove and do the speaking.
[1:41:56] &gt;&gt; Come on, folks.
[1:41:58] &gt;&gt; This is not just another church.
[1:42:00] &gt;&gt; You're not just another people.
[1:42:02] &gt;&gt; Can I tell you something? You're another
[1:42:04] Mary.
[1:42:05] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:42:07] &gt;&gt; You're another Mary.
[1:42:09] &gt;&gt; Oh, God.
[1:42:12] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Amen. I'm about to knock the
[1:42:14] walls out myself. You're another Mary.
[1:42:17] And God has opened his word and put a
[1:42:20] word in your mouth. Hallelujah. He don't
[1:42:23] need your abilities. He don't need your
[1:42:25] ambitions. He don't need your motives
[1:42:27] and agendas. He just needs you to open
[1:42:30] up your mouth and let the I am that I am
[1:42:33] feel it with a word of revelation.
[1:42:37] &gt;&gt; Somebody give confidence.
[1:42:46] It's a creative word. It's an
[1:42:48] authoritative word.
[1:42:55] &gt;&gt; Listen, Mary, you're going to bring
[1:42:57] forth the son.
[1:42:59] And the angel answered and said unto
[1:43:00] her, "The Holy Ghost." I'm stacking word
[1:43:02] upon word. Is that okay?
[1:43:04] &gt;&gt; The Holy Ghost shall come upon me,
[1:43:08] &gt;&gt; and the power of the highest
[1:43:13] shall overshadow thee.
[1:43:15] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:43:16] &gt;&gt; And the thing which shall be born of
[1:43:18] thee shall be called the son of God. Can
[1:43:23] I tell you what that word overshadow
[1:43:24] means? It's used of the Holy Spirit,
[1:43:28] exerting creative energy
[1:43:32] upon the womb of the Virgin Mary and
[1:43:36] impregnating it
[1:43:38] &gt;&gt; by a word.
[1:43:40] &gt;&gt; Oh God.
[1:43:41] Hallelujah.
[1:43:43] &gt;&gt; You know why it's so electrifying in
[1:43:44] here this morning is because the same
[1:43:48] overshadowing power.
[1:43:51] &gt;&gt; Now,
[1:43:52] &gt;&gt; Amen. I got to punch that devil again
[1:43:53] because he's showing his head.
[1:43:56] &gt;&gt; Now listen. And Mary said, "I can't do
[1:43:59] it."
[1:44:00] &gt;&gt; And Mary said, "I'm not able. I don't
[1:44:02] know a man." But you know what my Bible
[1:44:04] said? My Bible said that creative energy
[1:44:08] &gt;&gt; created a response in Mary.
[1:44:11] You know what Mary said? Behold the
[1:44:15] handmade of the Lord be it unto me.
[1:44:20] &gt;&gt; Brother Joe, according to thy word,
[1:44:23] Reverend said, I believe the same one
[1:44:25] that could overshadow Mary, that could
[1:44:27] create, he can also put a word in your
[1:44:30] mouth. I depend on him daily. It's his
[1:44:33] word. And he can't say something
[1:44:35] contrary to the word. Listen. Then if
[1:44:38] you say you're anointed and preach
[1:44:41] against the truths of God, then it's not
[1:44:43] the anointing of the Holy Spirit.
[1:44:48] &gt;&gt; Because the Holy Ghost overshadows you.
[1:44:50] He brings the same thing because it's
[1:44:53] the word. Now, Revelation 22:6, these
[1:44:57] are faithful and true. Look here.
[1:45:00] Blessed is he that keepeth the same of
[1:45:03] this book and doeth them. The same shall
[1:45:07] the right to the tree of life. Look here
[1:45:10] said, "You might keep the church
[1:45:11] sayings, but just keep Jesus's sayings."
[1:45:14] &gt;&gt; Amen. I'm going to I'm going to skip
[1:45:16] over a section here. I want to get
[1:45:18] somewhere if that's okay. He said, "See,
[1:45:20] you're believers and there's nothing can
[1:45:23] separate you." Revelation 22:10, give me
[1:45:26] that scripture. And he saith unto me,
[1:45:30] seal not, somebody say saints,
[1:45:34] &gt;&gt; seal not the sayings of the prophecy of
[1:45:39] this book. For the time is at hand. Look
[1:45:42] at this word saying it's a speech. It's
[1:45:45] a word. It's uttered by a living voice.
[1:45:49] And what you say embodies
[1:45:51] the conception or idea. the saints of
[1:45:55] God is a decree. It's a mandate. It's an
[1:46:00] order. What is declared is a thought and
[1:46:03] becomes a declaration. So the Bible says
[1:46:06] the time is at hand to say what's
[1:46:11] unsealed.
[1:46:14] &gt;&gt; Isn't it funny that right now we're
[1:46:16] dealing with more people that don't want
[1:46:17] you to quote brother Brandham,
[1:46:20] &gt;&gt; quote Charles Spurgeon, quote
[1:46:21] Wigglesworth, quote every president,
[1:46:24] quote every historian, quote every dict
[1:46:26] dictator, quote, quote whoever you want
[1:46:28] to, but just don't quote brother
[1:46:30] Brandham
[1:46:32] &gt;&gt; because you might offend somebody
[1:46:35] &gt;&gt; now. Now, come on.
[1:46:37] &gt;&gt; Punch that devil in the face.
[1:46:40] &gt;&gt; Don't say brother Brandham because you
[1:46:41] might offend the denominational spirit.
[1:46:44] &gt;&gt; Okay. Well, if you got somebody sitting
[1:46:46] in your church from the north and you're
[1:46:48] from the south and you quote a general
[1:46:50] from the Civil War that was in the
[1:46:52] South, are you going to back up because
[1:46:54] you might scare them that you won the
[1:46:56] &gt;&gt; Come on now.
[1:46:57] &gt;&gt; No. You know why? Because you believe
[1:47:00] what you're saying and you're not
[1:47:02] embarrassed to say it. And you know why
[1:47:04] people can't say what said is because
[1:47:06] just be honest. You don't believe it.
[1:47:10] &gt;&gt; Just go ahead and be on. Well, I don't
[1:47:12] believe. Amen. I believe. No, you don't.
[1:47:14] If you got to stand there and hack
[1:47:15] quotes and hack what a prophet said to
[1:47:18] present your idea and your direction, do
[1:47:20] us all a favor and just say you don't
[1:47:23] believe the message so we know where you
[1:47:25] stand.
[1:47:27] &gt;&gt; But if you do believe the message, then
[1:47:29] take off the gloves and quit being a
[1:47:31] kind old priest and say what's already
[1:47:34] been said.
[1:47:36] &gt;&gt; There's power behind those quotes.
[1:47:40] &gt;&gt; There's authority behind those quotes.
[1:47:45] Tell me, don't say it. Don't say it.
[1:47:49] &gt;&gt; I got a new answer for you. If God
[1:47:51] didn't want me to say it, he wouldn't
[1:47:53] have unsealed it.
[1:47:54] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:47:55] &gt;&gt; If God didn't want me to tell you this
[1:47:57] morning that missing limbs could be
[1:47:59] restored in this building, he would have
[1:48:02] never unsealed it. If God didn't want me
[1:48:04] to tell you this morning that he's the
[1:48:06] same God of Rosella Griffin that he was
[1:48:08] of your child, then he wouldn't have
[1:48:10] unsealed it.
[1:48:12] But because he unsealed it, he's ready
[1:48:14] for somebody to say it. And the prophet
[1:48:17] of God said this. He said, "The spirit
[1:48:19] and the prophet and the bride
[1:48:24] &gt;&gt; will be saying the same thing
[1:48:28] &gt;&gt; and what they will say will have already
[1:48:31] been said in the word."
[1:48:34] &gt;&gt; Reverend said, "How many's looking for a
[1:48:35] healing this morning?"
[1:48:38] I ask you, how many's looking for
[1:48:39] healing this morning?
[1:48:41] &gt;&gt; He said, you're looking for healing of
[1:48:42] the body to be so complicated. It's very
[1:48:46] simple.
[1:48:48] &gt;&gt; Just take God at his word and just
[1:48:51] saying the same thing he does. By his
[1:48:54] stripes, I am healed. Now, amen. Amen. I
[1:48:57] can't be this close to it and not say
[1:48:59] it. Okay.
[1:49:01] But the reason people don't know how to
[1:49:03] walk
[1:49:04] to a well body is because they're under
[1:49:07] the control of blind saints
[1:49:12] &gt;&gt; of blind guides.
[1:49:16] &gt;&gt; So because they can't see it, brother
[1:49:19] Tom, they don't want you to see it.
[1:49:21] &gt;&gt; And because they can't say it,
[1:49:25] &gt;&gt; they don't want you to see it. But a pro
[1:49:27] of God said, "If you come," he said,
[1:49:30] "Now look, let me tell you what to come
[1:49:31] saying. Don't come criticizing. Come
[1:49:34] saying, "God, I want to see where you're
[1:49:37] in it, and God will show you himself in
[1:49:40] it."
[1:49:42] &gt;&gt; Come on, folks.
[1:49:43] &gt;&gt; I'm I'm going to open up here a little
[1:49:45] bit because I' I've used that quote on a
[1:49:47] lot of people that the Lord leads
[1:49:48] somebody to do something and they get
[1:49:49] all been out of shape and it's of the
[1:49:51] devil and it's going to fall apart in 10
[1:49:53] years or five years or five day. And I I
[1:49:56] just looked at him, I said, "Look, amen.
[1:49:58] Don't go criticizing. Just go say, "God,
[1:50:01] I want to see where you're in it." Re
[1:50:03] said, "And God is under obligation to
[1:50:05] show you himself in it."
[1:50:08] &gt;&gt; If God is in it and you're a seed, he's
[1:50:11] under obligation.
[1:50:14] &gt;&gt; Come on, folks. Amen. You young people
[1:50:16] looking to get married. Amen. It ain't
[1:50:18] just about meeting somebody and talking
[1:50:19] to them and you like this and like the
[1:50:21] same color shirt. Amen. It's about
[1:50:23] finding is God in this or not. And if
[1:50:26] God is in it, then pray for God to show
[1:50:29] you where he's in it. And when he
[1:50:30] reveals to you he's in it, then you stay
[1:50:33] in it. But the minute God reveals to you
[1:50:35] he's not in it, get out of it.
[1:50:40] &gt;&gt; Come on, church. Put your running shoes
[1:50:42] on and run as far to the hills as you
[1:50:45] can.
[1:50:46] &gt;&gt; If you come here not saying, I come for
[1:50:48] one sole purpose. Amen. I'm home and I'm
[1:50:50] going to preach a little bit here and
[1:50:51] I'm not going to be much longer, but I
[1:50:53] want you to hear this. If you come here
[1:50:55] not saying I come for one sole purpose,
[1:50:57] that is to contact Christ for my body or
[1:50:59] my soul, you'll go home just as happy as
[1:51:02] you can be for you will contact him now.
[1:51:05] Amen. I I hope I don't kill the meeting
[1:51:07] right here in one quote, but it's on my
[1:51:09] heart.
[1:51:10] &gt;&gt; And I'm gonna read it.
[1:51:11] &gt;&gt; Is that okay?
[1:51:14] &gt;&gt; Amen. How many thanks God for our
[1:51:16] pastor?
[1:51:20] &gt;&gt; How many thanks God for our pastor's
[1:51:22] wife?
[1:51:24] Amen. Amen. Giving their lives to serve
[1:51:27] God's people.
[1:51:28] &gt;&gt; You say, "Well, well, you say, "Well, I
[1:51:30] don't like this and I don't like that,
[1:51:31] and I don't like Amen." But I tell you
[1:51:33] this, God's a God of transformation.
[1:51:35] &gt;&gt; God's a God that can take nothing and
[1:51:37] make something out of it.
[1:51:38] &gt;&gt; Come on, folks. God's a God that can
[1:51:40] take a horse barn and make a powerhouse
[1:51:42] of it.
[1:51:43] &gt;&gt; Amen. God's a God that can take a drunk
[1:51:45] and make a sinner and take a sinner and
[1:51:48] make a saint out of it.
[1:51:50] &gt;&gt; Come on. You know what a prophet of God
[1:51:51] said? He said, "You just come with a
[1:51:53] pure heart believing that Jesus Will you
[1:51:55] take this instruction?
[1:51:57] &gt;&gt; Believing that Jesus Christ is the
[1:51:59] savior and you've accepted him and you
[1:52:01] believe God will keep his word and
[1:52:03] you're looking to receive the baptism of
[1:52:05] the Holy Ghost and he will give it to
[1:52:07] you." Look here. Now say, somebody say
[1:52:09] with me, now say,
[1:52:11] &gt;&gt; now say, Lord, just any way you pour it
[1:52:13] into me just so I get the Holy Ghost.
[1:52:15] That's all I want is the baptism of the
[1:52:18] Holy Ghost. Give me something that'll
[1:52:20] take away the selfishness. Give me
[1:52:22] something that'll take the fear and
[1:52:24] doubting away. If you make me shout,
[1:52:27] that's okay. I've seen others shout and
[1:52:29] didn't live it. Don't make me speak with
[1:52:31] tongues. Lord, I've seen others speak
[1:52:32] with tongues and didn't live it. But
[1:52:34] Lord, put something in me that'll live
[1:52:36] in me.
[1:52:39] &gt;&gt; Lord, how many Grace tabernacle folks
[1:52:41] can say, Lord, in this church, put
[1:52:43] something in me that'll live in me. Not
[1:52:47] just something I feel on Sunday morning
[1:52:49] or feel on Wednesday night or feel down
[1:52:51] at the youth camp. I want something
[1:52:53] that'll live in me 247.
[1:52:57] &gt;&gt; Put something in me, Lord, that'll live.
[1:53:00] &gt;&gt; That'll make me walk every day as a
[1:53:02] Christian. That'll make me love my
[1:53:03] enemies. That'll make me speak good of
[1:53:05] those who speak evil of me. That'll make
[1:53:07] me ready to repent.
[1:53:12] &gt;&gt; Anything I do wrong,
[1:53:14] &gt;&gt; come right up and confess it. I'll say
[1:53:18] now Lord you know they me wrong and you
[1:53:20] know Lord I've been holding this grudge
[1:53:23] for 55 years.
[1:53:26] No I'll say I'm wrong. Forgive me God.
[1:53:34] &gt;&gt; That's the kind of spirit you want.
[1:53:37] &gt;&gt; Isn't it?
[1:53:39] &gt;&gt; See makes me humble.
[1:53:43] I didn't know I had this in my notes.
[1:53:46] When my pastor sees something wrong in
[1:53:48] me,
[1:53:57] &gt;&gt; he walks around and says, "Now, brother
[1:53:59] or sister, you ought not to do these
[1:54:02] things.
[1:54:07] &gt;&gt; Make me humble
[1:54:09] and say, "Yes, my brother.
[1:54:15] God, can I have seven nights on that
[1:54:16] one?
[1:54:19] &gt;&gt; Yes, my brother.
[1:54:21] I don't want that kind of spirit on me.
[1:54:24] Now, help me.
[1:54:27] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:54:29] &gt;&gt; Isn't it funny? A pastor's a man of God
[1:54:31] in the pull pit.
[1:54:33] &gt;&gt; But when he's watching over your Oh,
[1:54:34] God.
[1:54:37] But when he's watching over your life
[1:54:38] and he comes by and just has a little
[1:54:40] word with you, just an encouraging word,
[1:54:41] tries to help you a little bit, all of a
[1:54:43] sudden he's got something you
[1:54:45] &gt;&gt; see, as long as he's in the pull pit,
[1:54:47] it's the word in his mouth. But but when
[1:54:48] he calls you on the phone and says, you
[1:54:50] know, I've been noticing you've been
[1:54:51] missing church. I'm not here. I'm not
[1:54:53] trying to beat you or nothing. I just
[1:54:54] was everything okay?
[1:54:57] &gt;&gt; I'm going to preach and you can sit
[1:54:58] there and look at me. It's the same word
[1:55:00] in his mouth behind the pull pit as it
[1:55:02] is when he calls you on the phone.
[1:55:05] It's not a different God behind the pull
[1:55:07] pit and a different word on Monday. You
[1:55:09] know the problem is, hey, I'll just go
[1:55:11] ahead and say it. Nine times out of 10,
[1:55:13] the problem's not the pastor and it's
[1:55:15] not the deacon and it's not the pastor's
[1:55:17] wife. Amen. It's an old spirit on us.
[1:55:20] It's got a hold of our tongue and made
[1:55:22] us slow of speech to repent. But I say
[1:55:24] this morning, Lord, if you'll show me
[1:55:26] where I'm wrong and open my mouth and
[1:55:29] fill it with the word of repentance,
[1:55:31] I'll confess I'm wrong. I'll confess I
[1:55:33] shouldn't have said it. I'll confess I
[1:55:35] shouldn't have done it. And I'll say,
[1:55:36] "Lord, forgive me and change me."
[1:55:41] &gt;&gt; Amen. I'm out of time.
[1:55:43] &gt;&gt; I'm going to say this. Hallelujah.
[1:55:47] &gt;&gt; Open my mouth, Lord.
[1:55:50] &gt;&gt; Fill it with your word. I'm not going to
[1:55:52] read time. I'm just going to say it. Do
[1:55:54] you realize what you say reflects what
[1:55:56] you believe?
[1:56:00] &gt;&gt; And do you know what you say has got to
[1:56:01] be more what you feel.
[1:56:05] &gt;&gt; Can I just Can I just tie it up by
[1:56:07] saying this? The book is I'm trying,
[1:56:10] brother. You're pulling better than I'm
[1:56:12] preaching on. Are you hearing me? Amen.
[1:56:16] You got to You got to come to a spot.
[1:56:19] You got to come to a spot that you say,
[1:56:21] "Lord, let this book speak through me."
[1:56:27] &gt;&gt; You know why the devil's trying to seal
[1:56:29] this book back up?
[1:56:31] You know why?
[1:56:33] &gt;&gt; It's because he don't want you to say
[1:56:34] it.
[1:56:35] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:56:37] &gt;&gt; You know why he's trying to put seals
[1:56:39] back on this book? Is because he brother
[1:56:41] Adam don't want you to say it. He don't
[1:56:44] want you to confess the word over that
[1:56:46] situation. But come on, centurion. Come
[1:56:49] on, Roman centurion. My My child is
[1:56:52] sick. Amen. Oh, God. My child is sick.
[1:56:56] Amen. My child is sick. Amen. Would you
[1:56:58] come by my house? Oh no. Amen. Just
[1:57:01] speak the word.
[1:57:02] &gt;&gt; Just speak the word. Listen, Mr.
[1:57:05] Destiny, he was looking at the word and
[1:57:08] what he be to say was confessing what he
[1:57:12] believed about who he was looking at. He
[1:57:14] said, "I believe you don't even have to
[1:57:15] come to my house. You got enough power.
[1:57:17] If you just speak the word, when I get
[1:57:19] home, my child will be well." Come on,
[1:57:22] sire Phoenician woman. Come on, sire
[1:57:25] Phoenician woman. Amen. You're a gentile
[1:57:27] and you come up to the Lord and your
[1:57:29] daughter's grievously vexed with the
[1:57:30] devil and he looks at you and says,
[1:57:32] "It's not meat
[1:57:35] &gt;&gt; for me to give the crumb or to feed the
[1:57:37] bread to the dogs."
[1:57:39] &gt;&gt; And you know what she did? She folded
[1:57:41] her arms and said, "Bless God. That's
[1:57:43] the last time he'll ever talk to me like
[1:57:45] that. Bless God, I'll show man. Bless
[1:57:47] God, I'll show the deacon. Bless God,
[1:57:49] I'll show the church." You know what she
[1:57:51] said? She said, "Yay, Lord. Yay, Lord.
[1:57:55] But even the crumbs,
[1:57:58] &gt;&gt; even the crumbs that fall from the
[1:58:00] master's table, do the dogs eat. You
[1:58:02] know what the prophet of God said? He
[1:58:04] said it wasn't her speaking, brother
[1:58:06] Roy. It was her revelation speaking.
[1:58:10] &gt;&gt; Come on, woman with the issue of blood.
[1:58:12] Come on, woman with the issue of blood.
[1:58:14] You've been 12 long years with this
[1:58:16] issue of blood and this isn't helping.
[1:58:18] The doctors can't help you. Physicians
[1:58:20] can't help you. But she said within
[1:58:23] herself, "If I may but touch the hymn of
[1:58:27] his garment, I know I'll be made whole."
[1:58:31] &gt;&gt; Come on, brother said this. He said,
[1:58:33] "Come on, Hatty." Right?
[1:58:35] Come on, Hatty. Right. You're in there
[1:58:37] just cleaning the tables and dusting the
[1:58:40] dust and cleaning up the house. But you
[1:58:42] hear on the other side that the God of
[1:58:45] creation has returned in the age you're
[1:58:48] living in. And he created squirrels. and
[1:58:51] something begins to well up on the
[1:58:53] inside of you. What are you gonna say?
[1:58:56] &gt;&gt; What are you gonna say?
[1:58:59] &gt;&gt; What are you gonna say that ain't
[1:59:01] nothing but the truth?
[1:59:06] &gt;&gt; What are you saying, preacher? I'm
[1:59:08] saying this. God has redeemed you.
[1:59:12] &gt;&gt; God has unsealed his book.
[1:59:14] &gt;&gt; He has released these seals.
[1:59:17] &gt;&gt; He has opened his word.
[1:59:20] He just needs somebody
[1:59:23] &gt;&gt; to say it.
[1:59:26] &gt;&gt; Can I say it to you this morning?
[1:59:28] &gt;&gt; Here am I, Lord.
[1:59:29] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:59:32] &gt;&gt; Here. Here am I, Lord.
[1:59:34] &gt;&gt; I'll go say what a prophet said.
[1:59:37] &gt;&gt; I know they don't like it, but I'll go
[1:59:38] say it anyhow.
[1:59:40] &gt;&gt; Told you Wednesday night I was speak
[1:59:42] just a minute tonight. This morning,
[1:59:44] y'all, y'all praying for us and helped
[1:59:46] us go to Czech Republic. I went there
[1:59:48] under a
[1:59:50] was a backsliding line deceiving
[1:59:53] preacher from America left the message
[1:59:55] has been cowardly secretly going to
[1:59:57] young people overseas and trying to pull
[1:59:59] them out of the message
[2:00:03] and I accept the challenge of the word
[2:00:06] &gt;&gt; because I'm not Ahab, I'm Elijah.
[2:00:10] &gt;&gt; I don't run
[2:00:11] &gt;&gt; because some guy was dedicated by
[2:00:13] brother Brandham and now he don't
[2:00:14] believe brother's a prophet. Now all of
[2:00:15] a sudden no I'm sorry I'm not I'm not
[2:00:17] Saul. I'm David.
[2:00:18] &gt;&gt; Come on.
[2:00:20] &gt;&gt; Well, glory to God. I'll shout by
[2:00:22] myself.
[2:00:23] &gt;&gt; I'm David.
[2:00:25] &gt;&gt; So, I went over there and brother Matt,
[2:00:27] God is my witness. I didn't realize it
[2:00:28] until I left there on on Sunday. When I
[2:00:30] walked out of the out of the hotel where
[2:00:32] they were hosting the youth camp, I
[2:00:33] looked over at Josh Martin with me. I
[2:00:35] looked over, I said, "This is literally
[2:00:36] the first time I've been out of this
[2:00:38] building since I got here on Wednesday."
[2:00:42] He said, "Really?" I said, "Yeah, I went
[2:00:45] there under such a burden. I went to my
[2:00:46] room and studed. I went to the pull pit
[2:00:48] and preached. I went to my room and
[2:00:49] studied. Went to the pull pit and
[2:00:50] preached. I got in there on Friday night
[2:00:52] and begin to deal with the spirit of
[2:00:55] begging versus believing.
[2:00:57] &gt;&gt; And I said, "You ain't going to beg a
[2:00:59] revival.
[2:01:00] &gt;&gt; You ain't going to pray a revival out of
[2:01:01] this altar. You ain't going to fast one
[2:01:03] out of a prayer room. You're going to
[2:01:05] have to accept what God has sent in your
[2:01:08] hour." And I said, "What he sent is the
[2:01:11] message of the hour."
[2:01:12] &gt;&gt; Brother, when I said that, the Holy
[2:01:14] Ghost dropped right there in that
[2:01:15] building. I got home the other day. They
[2:01:18] actually baptized I think last count I
[2:01:20] had was nearly 24 people baptized out
[2:01:23] that camp.
[2:01:24] Young girl met me in the hallway going
[2:01:26] to my room. She met me there in the
[2:01:27] hallway and she said, "But Andrew," she
[2:01:29] said, "I got a question about the seals
[2:01:30] and the thunders." And she started
[2:01:32] telling me all these things and she
[2:01:33] said, "This man says this and that man
[2:01:35] says that and this man says this." And
[2:01:37] she said, "I'm really confused." She
[2:01:38] said, "What do I believe?" I said, "When
[2:01:41] did you get confused?" She said, "Well,
[2:01:43] when I listen to this man say this and
[2:01:45] this man say that." And I said, "Well,
[2:01:46] then go back to what a prophet said
[2:01:49] &gt;&gt; and you'll go back to not being
[2:01:50] confused.
[2:01:56] &gt;&gt; It's the book. Say it."
[2:01:58] &gt;&gt; If a prophet said the seven seals are
[2:02:00] open, say it. If he said rapture and
[2:02:03] faith is in those thunders, just say it.
[2:02:06] &gt;&gt; And I got I got home, brother Matt, the
[2:02:08] other day on Sunday. I woke up last
[2:02:09] Sunday thinking about those meetings and
[2:02:11] the devil bombarded my mind about that
[2:02:13] Friday night. And I just pray. I said,
[2:02:15] "Lord, I I just preach what was on my
[2:02:16] heart. I pray some way somehow it helped
[2:02:19] somebody, blessed somebody, done
[2:02:21] something for somebody and I know more
[2:02:22] and said that brother and I got a text
[2:02:24] on my phone and when I opened my phone
[2:02:26] it was the host pastor, assistant pastor
[2:02:28] there. He texted me Andrew he said got a
[2:02:31] testimony for you. He said Friday night
[2:02:33] while you were preaching on accepting
[2:02:35] the word as your deliverance. He said
[2:02:37] there was a young man sitting there had
[2:02:39] been gambling for years and said he was
[2:02:41] bound by it. Said he accepted his
[2:02:43] deliverance and baptizing him this
[2:02:46] morning
[2:02:48] &gt;&gt; and he's totally delivered.
[2:02:51] &gt;&gt; What are you saying? I'm saying God
[2:02:53] needs somebody to say what's been
[2:02:55] unsealed.
[2:02:57] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. I'm I'm I'm done. I'm
[2:02:59] closing my Bible. I read this. I got to
[2:03:01] say it to you. God has redeemed you,
[2:03:02] bride.
[2:03:03] &gt;&gt; God has redeemed you to speak through
[2:03:05] you. You know what the pro God said? He
[2:03:07] said God is full of mercy and he made a
[2:03:10] way to redeem that woman. And now he
[2:03:11] promised her, telling her that sometime
[2:03:14] in the future, the true word would come
[2:03:17] to her again.
[2:03:20] &gt;&gt; Can I tell you, you are she?
[2:03:23] &gt;&gt; The true word will be made known to her.
[2:03:25] You are her. Now remember the word.
[2:03:28] Christ through the word, the woman.
[2:03:30] Christ is the word. In the beginning was
[2:03:32] the word and the word was with God and
[2:03:34] the word was God.
[2:03:36] &gt;&gt; Satan, I bind you in the name of Jesus
[2:03:39] Christ. I bind your paralyzing forces on
[2:03:43] the vocal cords of these believers. I
[2:03:45] bind that spirit that has paralyzed your
[2:03:47] vocal cords. And it's been years since
[2:03:49] you've confessed the promises of God. In
[2:03:52] closing this morning, brother one, I
[2:03:54] take the liberty of the Holy Ghost to
[2:03:56] bind that devil and say, "The Holy Ghost
[2:03:58] is here to release your tongue. He's
[2:04:01] here to release your vocal cords. He's
[2:04:03] here to open your mouth. And he's here
[2:04:05] to feel it with the promises of his
[2:04:08] word.
[2:04:10] You say, "Preacher, what are you
[2:04:11] saying?" I'm going to say exactly what a
[2:04:12] prophet said. He said, "Here it is." He
[2:04:15] said, "Here it is." He said, "And Christ
[2:04:17] is the word." Now, before a word is a
[2:04:20] thought, a thought has to be created.
[2:04:22] All right?
[2:04:23] &gt;&gt; So, God's thoughts become creation.
[2:04:28] when it was spoke by a word
[2:04:32] &gt;&gt; that when he presents it to you as a
[2:04:35] thought his thoughts and it's revealed
[2:04:38] to you.
[2:04:42] &gt;&gt; Ready,
[2:04:43] &gt;&gt; brother Brian? Then it's still a thought
[2:04:47] until you speak it.
[2:04:49] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:04:52] But the minute you speak it,
[2:04:56] &gt;&gt; is the very minute it becomes the word.
[2:05:01] &gt;&gt; Oh, Grace tabernacle, open your mouth
[2:05:03] this morning and let the Holy Ghost fill
[2:05:06] it with the thoughts of God. Let the
[2:05:08] Holy Ghost fill your mouth. Listen,
[2:05:10] you've been thinking it. You've been
[2:05:12] praying about it. You've been thinking
[2:05:13] about it. But now it's time to say it.
[2:05:16] It's time to say it. Come on. You're
[2:05:18] sick. Go ahead right now and say, "I'm
[2:05:20] healed." You're bound. Go ahead right
[2:05:22] now and say, "I'm delivered." You're
[2:05:24] broke. Go ahead right now and say, "God
[2:05:26] supplies all of my needs according to
[2:05:30] his riches and glory." You're
[2:05:31] discouraged. Go ahead and say, "The Lord
[2:05:34] is the joy in my life."
[2:05:36] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:05:37] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. You don't know which way to
[2:05:39] turn. Go ahead and say it. All things
[2:05:41] work together
[2:05:43] &gt;&gt; for the good
[2:05:44] &gt;&gt; for the good to them who love God,
[2:05:46] Brother Bobby. And who are called
[2:05:48] according to his purpose. I close by
[2:05:51] saying this this morning. The revelation
[2:05:53] is speaking.
[2:05:55] &gt;&gt; The revelation is speaking, brother
[2:05:57] Jared. The revelation has a voice.
[2:06:02] &gt;&gt; It's yours. Won't you stand to your feet
[2:06:04] this morning?
[2:06:07] &gt;&gt; God
[2:06:09] has unsealed the book to you.
[2:06:11] &gt;&gt; God
[2:06:14] has revealed
[2:06:16] the thought to you.
[2:06:19] Oh, these things are so wonderful,
[2:06:20] Brother Andrew. Oh, these things are so
[2:06:23] powerful, Brother Andrew. Oh, Brother
[2:06:25] Matt, that was such a powerful servant
[2:06:27] preach. Oh, brother, that was so good.
[2:06:30] Take another step.
[2:06:34] Take another step. You know what?
[2:06:42] You know what a prophet God said? He
[2:06:45] said when you speak it, he says then it
[2:06:48] becomes
[2:06:50] an
[2:06:55] L folks. I'm not a crazy man.
[2:06:59] There's some warriors in this building.
[2:07:05] Sister
[2:07:14] not just a sister that comes to this
[2:07:16] church. It's a warrior.
[2:07:17] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:07:20] &gt;&gt; Can I preach a second?
[2:07:22] &gt;&gt; She started this church. When they
[2:07:23] started this church, she come here and
[2:07:25] begin to confess. I remember I remember
[2:07:28] brother Matt the first time I preached
[2:07:30] her praying for I believe it was David
[2:07:32] Paul. I remember watching her pray and
[2:07:35] confess God is going to save my babies.
[2:07:38] &gt;&gt; God's going to bring them in. Listen
[2:07:40] folks, I remember their names over there
[2:07:41] on that wall.
[2:07:43] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:07:44] &gt;&gt; Sister Becca, I remember. But today I'm
[2:07:46] standing here and I'm looking at the
[2:07:48] confession of faith that's paid off.
[2:07:52] &gt;&gt; She fought a good fight, but the devil
[2:07:54] tried to pull one out. She said, "I will
[2:07:56] not lay down, Destiny. I remember, but I
[2:07:59] will not lay down. Brother Wesley, you
[2:08:02] would not lay down. Brother Jared, you
[2:08:04] wouldn't lay down." You say, "Preacher,
[2:08:05] this don't work." Amen. Too late. I've
[2:08:07] got a witness in the building. If God
[2:08:10] reveals a promise to your heart, he's
[2:08:12] going to save your babies come hell or
[2:08:14] high water. You won't back up. You won't
[2:08:16] lay down. You'll stand there and say,
[2:08:18] "They're coming home. I don't care how
[2:08:20] far they've run. I don't care how low
[2:08:22] they are. They're coming home." Because
[2:08:24] the word has become the anchor of my
[2:08:26] soul. I'm confessing it's already done.
[2:08:30] And now you stand here today, Becca,
[2:08:32] dedicating a baby. God gave you a
[2:08:34] husband. Brother Kyle, God bless you.
[2:08:36] You say, "Preacher, you lost your mind.
[2:08:38] I haven't lost my mind. I got a hold of
[2:08:41] something to say."
[2:08:42] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:08:43] &gt;&gt; I got a confession in my soul.
[2:08:46] &gt;&gt; And it's the anchor.
[2:08:48] &gt;&gt; It's the reason I preach.
[2:08:53] Reynolds, Reynolds family, the devil
[2:08:57] tried to take you out,
[2:08:59] but he didn't have enough because inside
[2:09:02] of this book spoke about a resurrection
[2:09:05] and spoke about a rapture and spoke
[2:09:07] about the dead and Christ rising first.
[2:09:09] And the devil tried to take your
[2:09:11] ministry out, Joel. The devil tried to
[2:09:13] take your confession out. Amen. But a
[2:09:15] prophet come and said, "Don't worry.
[2:09:17] Some morning between 6:00 and 9, your
[2:09:20] dead loved ones are going to come
[2:09:21] walking before you." And for years, he's
[2:09:24] gone around the world preaching. God is
[2:09:26] going to give her back. It's more than
[2:09:28] just a book. It's more than just a tape.
[2:09:31] It's time to say it.
[2:09:34] &gt;&gt; Unsave the ceilings of this book.
[2:09:38] &gt;&gt; Say it this morning.
[2:09:42] &gt;&gt; Confess your way out of it.
[2:09:45] [Music]
[2:09:49] &gt;&gt; I'm not a crazy man, Brother Peter. I'm
[2:09:51] not a crazy man. I know the devil may
[2:09:54] think because your daddy went on the
[2:09:56] glory that you ain't going to be
[2:09:58] nothing. That devil's a liar.
[2:10:01] &gt;&gt; He's got a message and it's an anchor.
[2:10:04] And I say this morning, Sister Barbara,
[2:10:06] it's more than just a quote. It's an
[2:10:08] anchor of the soul. And if you'll begin
[2:10:10] to confess it, it ain't going to be very
[2:10:12] much longer. And they're going to slow
[2:10:14] down. And I'm going to speed up and I'm
[2:10:16] going to be joined again.
[2:10:18] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:10:19] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Hallelujah. I'm not a crazy
[2:10:22] man. Amen, Cody. I'm not a crazy man.
[2:10:25] You got a hold of something a few years
[2:10:26] ago, buddy. And the devil tried to take
[2:10:28] it out of you. But I stand here this
[2:10:30] morning, I say the devil didn't have
[2:10:32] enough, sis. The devil didn't have
[2:10:34] enough because greater was the
[2:10:36] confession of the word of God than the
[2:10:39] situations of the lives.
[2:10:42] He's greater, Sister Jennifer. God's
[2:10:45] greater,
[2:10:48] &gt;&gt; Brother David. God's greater
[2:10:51] and his word,
[2:10:53] his word
[2:10:55] has been upheld. It's time to speak it.
[2:10:58] Won't you raise your hands this morning?
[2:11:03] Testifying is not lying.
[2:11:06] I'm sorry, brother Tom. Testifying is
[2:11:09] not lying. It's confessing.
[2:11:12] It's confessing. Why don't you this
[2:11:15] morning break out of that old negative
[2:11:16] confession? Is there Moses here today.
[2:11:20] Is there a Moses here today? Lord, I'm
[2:11:22] slow of speech. Lord, my tongue is slow.
[2:11:26] Lord, I'm not eloquent enough. Lord,
[2:11:28] this is a mighty commission. Lord, you
[2:11:30] placed this and revealed it and put it
[2:11:32] on my heart. Lord, there's no way I can
[2:11:34] do it. Is there one this morning? Maybe
[2:11:36] maybe you're a mother here and the
[2:11:39] devil's telling you you can't raise them
[2:11:40] babies. You're going to lose your mind
[2:11:42] and nervousness is going to take over.
[2:11:44] Anxiety is going to destroy you. I
[2:11:46] rebuke that devil in the name of Jesus
[2:11:48] Christ.
[2:11:50] Maybe you're a father here and the
[2:11:52] devil's telling you you ain't going to
[2:11:53] make it and you're going to lose your
[2:11:55] home. You're going to lose your family.
[2:11:57] That devil is a liar this morning and
[2:11:59] you've opened up your mouth long enough
[2:12:01] and let that devil fill your mouth. I
[2:12:03] say right now, it's time to open your
[2:12:05] mouth and let the God of Moses, let the
[2:12:08] God of Moses put a piece of bread in
[2:12:09] that mouth and let him say, "I am that I
[2:12:12] am has sent thee."
[2:12:14] It's time for healing this morning. It's
[2:12:17] time for healing this morning.
[2:12:19] Hallelujah. Right now. This morning. Go
[2:12:21] ahead. Go ahead right now and open your
[2:12:23] mouth and let the bread of his presence,
[2:12:26] let the promise of his word, let the
[2:12:28] confession of the word, let it come into
[2:12:30] your mouth this morning. Let it come
[2:12:32] into your heart this morning. Let it
[2:12:34] open your mouth wide. Say, "Lord, I've
[2:12:36] confessed my negativities. I've
[2:12:38] confessed my insecurities. I've
[2:12:40] confessed my complexes long enough.
[2:12:42] Lord, you said you healed Moses when you
[2:12:45] put your commission in his mouth. Lord,
[2:12:47] open my mouth and heal me this morning.
[2:12:50] Lord, I'm not a failure. I'm not a
[2:12:53] mistake. I'm not an accident. I'm not
[2:12:55] serpent seen. I'm not defeated. I'm not
[2:12:58] overcome. I am the bride of Jesus
[2:13:00] Christ.
[2:13:03] Hallelujah.
[2:13:05] Hallelujah. Almighty God, all across
[2:13:08] this building this morning, Lord, hearts
[2:13:10] are being opened. Lives are being opened
[2:13:12] this morning. Father, you're here
[2:13:14] dealing with your redeemed bride. Lord,
[2:13:17] she's opened her mouth this morning.
[2:13:19] Lord, you said if we would open our
[2:13:20] mouths, Lord, that you would fill it
[2:13:22] with good things. Father, we didn't open
[2:13:25] our mouth to receive a creed. We didn't
[2:13:27] open our mouth to receive a little small
[2:13:30] church annity about you. But Lord, we've
[2:13:32] opened our mouth wide to receive the
[2:13:34] open book. Revelations 10 said, "Come,
[2:13:37] take the book, eat the book."
[2:13:40] Hallelujah. Father, I believe there's
[2:13:41] some bride members here today in Grace
[2:13:43] Tabernacle. I believe there's some bride
[2:13:46] members here today represented in here
[2:13:48] from other churches, Lord. Father, I
[2:13:50] believe they're ready to open their
[2:13:51] mouth. I believe they're ready to be
[2:13:53] filled with the revelation of your word.
[2:13:55] Oh, Satan, I bind you in the name of the
[2:13:58] Lord Jesus Christ. By the authority of
[2:14:01] the open book, by the authority of the
[2:14:03] Bible, I bind you, Satan, I paralyze
[2:14:06] your vocal cords this morning. Speak no
[2:14:09] longer to the children of God.
[2:14:12] Hallelujah.
[2:14:14] Father, things they've been thinking
[2:14:15] about, things they've been thinking
[2:14:17] about, Lord, let that super anointing
[2:14:20] that swept over Hattie, Hallelujah. Let
[2:14:24] that super anointing that swept over
[2:14:26] Hattie, let it sweep across this
[2:14:28] building this morning, Lord.
[2:14:31] Hallelujah.
[2:14:33] Hallelujah.
[2:14:34] Hallelujah.
[2:14:36] Let it sweep across this building this
[2:14:38] morning. Oh God,
[2:14:42] sweep across the heart of the fifth
[2:14:43] Gospels here, Lord.
[2:14:46] Sweep across the heart of the men of God
[2:14:48] here.
[2:14:51] Hallelujah. Hallelujah.
[2:14:54] Oh God, let that super anointing sweep
[2:14:56] through this building today.
[2:14:58] Releasing the faith,
[2:15:01] releasing the vocal cords of your
[2:15:04] children.
[2:15:05] Lord, the time is at hand. The book is
[2:15:08] unsealed.
[2:15:10] Lord, you're ready for somebody to speak
[2:15:11] it. Walk forward.
[2:15:15] You're ready for somebody to speak it.
[2:15:18] Lord, I took time this morning just to
[2:15:19] point out a few examples. Lord, I wasn't
[2:15:22] like nobody. Lord, I know this whole
[2:15:25] building is full of examples, Lord.
[2:15:27] Father, I think of our pastor, Brother
[2:15:28] Mad, his wife several years ago. Lord,
[2:15:32] stepping out under the under the
[2:15:34] direction of the Holy Spirit, Father, to
[2:15:36] follow what you made up on his heart.
[2:15:38] Lord, it become a thought, become a
[2:15:40] word. He be to speak it, Lord. Father,
[2:15:43] through the good times, the word has
[2:15:44] been his anchor. Through the low times,
[2:15:46] the word has been his anchor. Father, I
[2:15:49] pray today, dear God. Lord, for every
[2:15:51] believer here today, Lord, that maybe
[2:15:54] they're afraid to take another step.
[2:15:56] They're afraid to take that step of
[2:15:57] speaking it. Lord, they sit there and
[2:15:59] they hear the word and they think about
[2:16:01] it. They think about your power to do
[2:16:02] it. They think about how great you are.
[2:16:04] Hallelujah. Satan, get out of my way.
[2:16:07] They think about how wonderful your
[2:16:09] message is, but they're just afraid to
[2:16:11] take that next step of speaking it.
[2:16:14] Lord, may this be the day.
[2:16:18] This be the day they take the step and
[2:16:20] they speak it
[2:16:22] in the name of Jesus.
[2:16:25] In the name of Jesus.

[2:20:34] [Music]
[2:20:36] [Applause]
[2:20:37] as they play that softly. I want to tell
[2:20:40] you this morning. I'm sorry we're going
[2:20:42] over a little bit.
[2:20:43] &gt;&gt; But I want to give that devil a black
[2:20:45] eye right now cuz there's a spirit
[2:20:47] warning a good good war right now that
[2:20:50] God is not able to do what he puts in
[2:20:52] your heart.
[2:20:53] &gt;&gt; God's not able, brother Brian, to really
[2:20:55] do it. He He did it for Moses and he did
[2:20:57] it for David, but he can't do it for
[2:20:58] you.
[2:20:59] &gt;&gt; Amen. Can I give that devil a black eye?
[2:21:02] &gt;&gt; Amen. Can I tell y'all something? Amen,
[2:21:04] brother Matt. In just a few days, it'll
[2:21:06] be a year since we moved here. Amen. I
[2:21:08] was sitting this morning in my office.
[2:21:10] And I was reading over these things
[2:21:12] about about following God, the anchor of
[2:21:14] the word. And I the Lord brought
[2:21:16] something back to my memory. Some of
[2:21:17] y'all probably don't even know this, but
[2:21:19] when I was when we were traveling here,
[2:21:21] evangelizing, preaching here, and coming
[2:21:22] through here, there were times the Lord
[2:21:24] would put things on my heart so heavy to
[2:21:27] preach in this church. And there was one
[2:21:29] particular time, brother Matt, we came
[2:21:32] and the reason I'm telling the devil
[2:21:33] that and telling this testimony is to
[2:21:34] give the devil a black eye right now. We
[2:21:37] came here. Brother Matt asked us to do a
[2:21:39] special service or something. And we
[2:21:40] came here and when he asked me to do it
[2:21:42] several months before, I knew the devil
[2:21:44] was attacking an individual in this
[2:21:46] church. I'm not a prophet, neither the
[2:21:48] son of a prophet, but I follow a
[2:21:49] prophet's message. And the Holy Spirit
[2:21:52] spoke in my heart and put that person's
[2:21:54] name on my heart and said, "You can't
[2:21:56] make it happen, but if you'll preach the
[2:21:59] word, it'll happen."
[2:22:01] &gt;&gt; I said, "Lord, I'm going to go there."
[2:22:03] And I came here that weekend and I
[2:22:05] preached the word. And I've never even
[2:22:07] told this or told this to the person.
[2:22:08] They tell them today. But I want to tell
[2:22:10] that devil something. They're standing
[2:22:12] right here in this building. And that
[2:22:14] was nearly three years ago. And they got
[2:22:16] their hands up raised and they're
[2:22:18] praising God. Listen, God don't need our
[2:22:21] abilities. Brother Morgan, he just needs
[2:22:24] our mouth. He just needs our mouth.
[2:22:26] Brother Matt, God showed you faces you
[2:22:28] would baptize. And they're here this
[2:22:30] morning. He don't need your abilities.
[2:22:33] He just needs your mouth. And he wants
[2:22:35] to feel it with the message of the hour.
[2:22:37] And he'll bring to pass a great victory
[2:22:41] because he's God. That's the anchor of
[2:22:44] my soul.
[2:22:45] &gt;&gt; And hell or high water won't shake me
[2:22:47] off of it, Brother Wesley. He's God.
[2:22:52] &gt;&gt; He's here this morning.
[2:22:54] &gt;&gt; He's right here in this field to do
[2:22:55] exactly what you have need of.
[2:22:58] &gt;&gt; If anyone needs prayer, we're glad to
[2:22:59] pray with you today. God bless you.
[2:23:04] [Music]
[2:23:15] &gt;&gt; Yes, I know.
[2:23:17] &gt;&gt; I know. There is peace within your
[2:23:21] presence.

[2:23:34] Your name is healing.
[2:23:37] Your name is
[2:23:45] every

[2:36:01] as I still know King Jesus,
[2:36:07] I know that I I can still
[2:36:12] go free.
[2:36:14] And I say that I
[2:36:18] can still
[2:36:20] go free.
[2:36:25] Tell me what kind
[2:36:27] of man
[2:36:30] would reach down
[2:36:32] his hand
[2:36:34] and do this for me.
[2:36:40] So unworthy
[2:36:43] to live,
[2:36:45] if not
[2:36:47] to kill, but dead a man on the cross
[2:36:53] put my name
[2:36:56] in his will and set
[2:36:59] [Music]
[2:37:03] free.
[2:37:06] till I never
[2:37:09] could
[2:37:11] understand
[2:37:13] this one thing.
[2:37:15] Tell me why a king would want to leave
[2:37:20] his throne
[2:37:21] [Music]
[2:37:24] just to put on
[2:37:27] the ro
[2:37:29] of an earthly
[2:37:31] man.
[2:37:33] didn't have to feel the pain of common
[2:37:36] flesh
[2:37:38] and bone
[2:37:41] just for one purpose.
[2:37:43] Later walked down
[2:37:47] that lonely
[2:37:50] path
[2:37:51] [Music]
[2:37:54] to dark.
[2:37:59] But I know that the blood my Jesus shed.
[2:38:04] He signed my pardon
[2:38:07] [Applause]
[2:38:08] and said that I How many can you declare
[2:38:11] today? I know that I'll be free.
[2:38:16] So I say that I
[2:38:20] can still
[2:38:22] go free.
[2:38:26] Oh, tell me what kind
[2:38:29] of man
[2:38:31] that would reach down
[2:38:33] his hand
[2:38:35] and do this for me.
[2:38:40] I'm so unworthy
[2:38:44] to live
[2:38:47] not
[2:38:48] to kill. But then a man on the cross, he
[2:38:55] had my name in his will and said that I
[2:39:01] can
[2:39:04] go.
[2:39:06] I set
[2:39:08] a man on
[2:39:11] the cross
[2:39:13] had my name in his wings and said that I
[2:39:19] can.
[2:39:24] &gt;&gt; How many free this morning? How many
[2:39:27] give the Lord a hand clap of praise?
[2:39:33] I've been changed.
[2:39:36] I've been healed.
[2:39:39] Yes, I've been free.
[2:39:42] I've been delivered.
[2:39:46] Well, I found joy.
[2:39:50] I found peace.
[2:39:52] Amazing grace.
[2:39:56] I'm highly favor.
[2:39:59] And right now is the moment.
[2:40:03] Today is the day I've been changed.
[2:40:09] Yes, I've been changed.
[2:40:12] Well, I said I won't go back. I can't go
[2:40:17] back to the way it used to be before
[2:40:21] your spirit came and changed me.
[2:40:25] Well, I said I won't go back. I can't go
[2:40:30] back to the way it used to be before
[2:40:34] your spirit came and changed me.
[2:40:39] &gt;&gt; Well, all my shame,
[2:40:41] &gt;&gt; all my
[2:40:42] &gt;&gt; All my guilt,
[2:40:44] &gt;&gt; all my fears,
[2:40:45] &gt;&gt; it's all my sins,
[2:40:48] &gt;&gt; my s
[2:40:49] &gt;&gt; they've been forgiven.
[2:40:52] &gt;&gt; Now there's no more chains. No more
[2:40:55] tears.
[2:40:56] &gt;&gt; No more fear.
[2:40:58] &gt;&gt; No more tears.
[2:40:58] &gt;&gt; Yes. All my past
[2:41:02] &gt;&gt; is finally over.
[2:41:05] And right now is the moment.
[2:41:10] Today is the day I've been changed.
[2:41:15] &gt;&gt; Yes, I've been changed. And I say that I
[2:41:20] won't go back. I can't go back. How many
[2:41:24] can say it this morning? Well, well,
[2:41:27] before the spirit came and changed me.
[2:41:31] Well, I know I won't go back. I can't go

[2:41:50] to the way you used to be.
[2:41:53] before your spirit came and changed me.
[2:41:58] Well, I said I won't go back. I can't go
[2:42:02] back to the way it used to be before
[2:42:07] your spirit came and changed me.
[2:42:13] [Music]
[2:42:16] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:42:18] &gt;&gt; How many enjoys the presence of the Lord
[2:42:19] this morning?
[2:42:21] Well, he's God if you love him. He's God
[2:42:26] if you won't. He's God if you serve him.

[2:43:26] He's God when the lightning flashes.
[2:43:29] He's God when thunder rolls. He's God

[2:43:35] my soul. I know God. He is God. And God
[2:43:39] don't ever change. I know God is God.
[2:43:44] And Jesus is his name.
[2:43:47] But I remember the day he saved me from
[2:43:50] the life of sin and chained. Went down
[2:43:53] into the water rejoicing. Baptized in
[2:43:56] Jesus name. I know God is God and God
[2:44:01] don't ever change. I know God. He's God
[2:44:05] and Jesus is his name.
[2:44:08] Well, he's God if you love him. He's God

[2:44:36] Father? And can you tell me his name?
[2:44:40] And Jesus dwells the fullness of the
[2:44:42] Godhead. Don't you see? Well, Jesus is

[2:45:26] of fire. I am the God of Abraham, the
[2:45:30] bright and morning star. I am the rose
[2:45:33] of Sharon from beginning whence I came.
[2:45:37] I am the whole creation and Jesus is my
[2:45:41] name. I know God is God and God don't
[2:45:45] ever change. I know God is God and Jesus
[2:45:50] is your name.
[2:45:53] I am before Abraham. He rejoiced to see
[2:45:57] my days. When Jesus spoke these precious
[2:46:00] words, they stoned him right away. Well,
[2:46:04] why do you stone me? He asked in a sweet
[2:46:07] command. Because you say that you are
[2:46:10] God and we think you're just a man. But
[2:46:13] I know God, he is God and God don't ever
[2:46:17] change. I know God is God and Jesus is
[2:46:22] his name.
[2:46:24] It was on the day of Pentecost. Oh, how
[2:46:27] the power did fall. The Holy Ghost
[2:46:30] descended and filled them one and all.
[2:46:34] Then Peter told the multitude to repent
[2:46:37] of all your sins in Jesus name. 3,000
[2:46:41] souls were baptized and born again. But
[2:46:44] I know God is God and God don't ever
[2:46:48] change. I know God is God and Jesus is
[2:46:53] his name.
[2:46:55] Well, he's God. If you love him, he's
[2:46:58] God. If you don't, he's God. If you
[2:47:02] serve him, he's still God. If you won't,
[2:47:05] I know God. He is God. And God don't
[2:47:09] ever change. I know God is God. And
[2:47:13] Jesus is his name.
[2:47:20] He's still God if you're serving. He's
[2:47:22] God if you won't. He's God if you give
[2:47:24] him praise. He's still God if you don't.
[2:47:27] &gt;&gt; But I say since he is God, he's not just
[2:47:29] a God, but he's my God. And I choose to
[2:47:32] give him praise.
[2:47:34] &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord, for all you've done for
[2:47:36] me. You've never failed me. You're the
[2:47:38] God of of my family. You're the God of
[2:47:41] my problems. You're the God of of my
[2:47:43] trials. You're the God of my mistakes,
[2:47:45] my weaknesses.
[2:47:46] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah,
[2:47:46] &gt;&gt; and all my failures. You're my God.
[2:47:49] &gt;&gt; I say he's still God. How many believes
[2:47:51] he's God?
[2:47:52] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:47:53] &gt;&gt; I believe it this morning. I want you to
[2:47:54] give him a hand clap of praise. I said,
[2:47:56] how many believe he's still God?
[2:47:59] He's God.
[2:48:01] He's the very the very open door to
[2:48:04] every revelation you ever receive.
[2:48:06] Brother said, "The open door, what is
[2:48:07] it?" He said, "It's the revelation of
[2:48:09] the supreme deity of Jesus Christ. He is
[2:48:12] our God."
[2:48:13] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[2:48:14] &gt;&gt; Amen. That he still has power over every
[2:48:17] sickness. I thought that was powerful.
[2:48:20] &gt;&gt; What a
[2:48:21] what a powerful message.
[2:48:24] When God's thought, that makes me want
[2:48:27] to shout over again. When God's thought
[2:48:29] is revealed to you, it's still a thought
[2:48:33] until you speak it and then it becomes a
[2:48:35] word.
[2:48:36] &gt;&gt; I wonder how many times that's where we
[2:48:38] battle at, brother John. Our greatest
[2:48:40] battle is fought in our thought world,
[2:48:42] in our mind. Satan's bring he's bringing
[2:48:45] thoughts by all the time. Most of the
[2:48:48] times you feel bad about yourself. It
[2:48:49] wasn't even your it wasn't even your own
[2:48:51] thoughts. It was the devil's thoughts. I
[2:48:52] can tell you it was. It's the devil's
[2:48:54] thoughts. But then the thought of God
[2:48:56] comes in because you heard it in the
[2:48:58] word somewhere and he just comes by at
[2:49:00] the right time.
[2:49:01] &gt;&gt; And he said it still remains a thought
[2:49:03] until you speak it. Then it become a
[2:49:05] word. Then it has power over your life
[2:49:07] and power over your problem and power
[2:49:09] over everything you're going through.
[2:49:10] How many believes that?
[2:49:12] &gt;&gt; Can you take the word of God and speak
[2:49:13] it? I said, how many believes that? Say
[2:49:15] amen.
[2:49:16] &gt;&gt; It's a message on speaking the word of
[2:49:18] God. You can stay that way if you want
[2:49:20] to, but I choose not to. God blesses my
[2:49:22] life because I speak it
[2:49:24] &gt;&gt; and I believe and I believe what I'm
[2:49:25] speaking.
[2:49:27] &gt;&gt; It don't matter what you got or how much
[2:49:29] you got. I've been over to India. People
[2:49:30] didn't have nothing. The happiest people
[2:49:32] I ever met in my life. Didn't have
[2:49:34] nothing. What we would call something.
[2:49:36] Didn't have no cars and houses and all
[2:49:38] that stuff. Living in a mud hut and
[2:49:39] having most joy. And they're happier
[2:49:41] than anybody you ever met because they
[2:49:43] speak the thought of God.
[2:49:45] &gt;&gt; I believe that. How many believes that?
[2:49:46] Say amen.
[2:49:47] &gt;&gt; Amen. You believe the word of God. What
[2:49:49] a powerful message. How many give the
[2:49:50] Lord another hand clap of praise?
[2:49:54] What a what a blessing to be in the
[2:49:55] presence of God.
[2:49:59] Just want to remember all the the people
[2:50:02] that are gone this morning. We had
[2:50:03] several families that are out traveling.
[2:50:05] Brother Ben and ask for prayer for their
[2:50:07] family. Just want to remember them.
[2:50:09] Jordan Xavier went to visit some family
[2:50:12] in Michigan. So there's there's many
[2:50:14] that are that are gone. We just want to
[2:50:16] remember them. Safe travels on their way
[2:50:18] back. I pray that God will bless each
[2:50:20] one of you as you go and take that
[2:50:23] creative energy, whether Andrew was
[2:50:25] speaking about it, let it take hold of
[2:50:27] your life. Let God use you. Let it speak
[2:50:31] out of your lips and let that power to
[2:50:33] create an atmosphere. Isn't that Isn't
[2:50:35] that what the prophet said?
[2:50:36] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:50:37] &gt;&gt; You could create an atmosphere. Create a
[2:50:39] world and live on that very world.
[2:50:40] Create an atmosphere right in the middle
[2:50:42] of layout in the middle of work and all
[2:50:44] the trouble that we go through. But by
[2:50:46] the power of your own tongue, you can
[2:50:48] create an atmosphere. I believe we have
[2:50:50] a right to do it. Amen. People may come
[2:50:52] by and think you're crazy. Well, if I'm
[2:50:54] crazy, just let me alone. I'm kind of
[2:50:56] happy like this.
[2:50:57] &gt;&gt; You might not think much about me, but
[2:50:59] I'm I'm just happy in the Lord. That's
[2:51:02] what we want to be. Amen. You love the
[2:51:03] Lord this morning. Brother Joe, could
[2:51:05] you close us in a word?
[2:51:16] [Music]
[2:51:30] Amen. We just want to invite everybody.
[2:51:32] We're having our potluck dinner in the
[2:51:34] fellowship hall. Everybody's welcome. If
[2:51:36] you didn't bring anything, that's okay.
[2:51:37] You're still welcome. We've got plenty
[2:51:39] of food for everybody. So, we just
[2:51:41] invite everybody to participate. Also, I
[2:51:44] would ask that when you go to get in
[2:51:46] line for the food to make sure that the
[2:51:48] elders are visitors are in the front of
[2:51:51] the line. We always allow our elders to
[2:51:53] go first. I know the kids like to jump
[2:51:55] up in there, but we certainly want to
[2:51:57] honor our elders. Don't want them
[2:51:59] standing up in the back of the line and
[2:52:00] waiting to get food. And so, y'all just
[2:52:03] allow the elders to go first. And we
[2:52:05] just we appreciate your uh complying to
[2:52:08] that. God bless you.
[2:52:14] &gt;&gt; Nothing but the blood of Jesus.
[2:52:20] can wash away my sin.
[2:52:24] Nothing but the blood of Jesus.
[2:52:29] What can make me whole again?
[2:52:34] Nothing but the blood of Jesus.
[2:52:39] Oh, precious is the flow that makes
[2:52:47] [Music]
[2:52:47] [Applause]
[2:52:49] [Music]
[2:52:52] I know nothing but the blood of Jesus.
[2:52:58] [Music]
[2:52:59] By this
[2:53:01] I have done nothing but the blood of
[2:53:06] Jesus.
[2:53:08] Now by this I'll reach my home. Nothing
[2:53:14] but the blood of Jesus.
[2:53:17] [Music]
