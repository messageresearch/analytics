[29:58] kind of hard. I've been having some
[29:59] struggles in my body, [music] just pain
[30:01] and stuff. And uh, last night it was
[30:02] really getting to me and I was sitting
[30:04] on the couch [music] just talking to the
[30:06] Lord about it, you know, just wondering
[30:08] where to take it to, you know, when
[30:10] doctors hit their end. That's where the
[30:11] word starts as brother Brown said and uh
[30:13] I just [music] I didn't know what to
[30:15] pray because I feel like I've prayed
[30:16] everything and I just I just sitting on
[30:17] the couch and I just whispered his name.
[30:20] I just said Jesus [music] and such a
[30:22] sweet spirit came over me in that living
[30:24] room. And this this song's just been
[30:26] stuck in my head all day. So I hope it
[30:28] blesses somebody as much as it blesses
[30:29] me.

[31:08] is [singing] applied.
[31:10] He can break those [music] prison
[31:13] chains. Use his [singing] name.

[31:23] Oh, his name moves mountains. [singing]
[31:29] Use that name. [singing]

[31:45] the words of the king.
[31:50] [singing]
[31:51] If there's a mountain [music] you want
[31:55] moving, if there's a giant [singing]
[31:59] in your way, if you're in [music]
[32:02] prison, here's your escape. Use that
[32:07] name.
[32:09] [music]
[32:11] Now as they stood and they [singing]
[32:13] sadly watched as he ascended.
[32:18] Oh Lord
[32:21] please stay for our needs.
[32:25] We're dependent. [singing]
[32:28] [music]
[32:29] Oh but Jesus left them with a weapon
[32:33] [singing]
[32:35] a sure way
[32:38] of defense. [music] Speak [singing] with
[32:40] faith. The Lord did say, "Use my name."
[32:47] Oh, use his name. [singing]
[32:52] Cuz his name moves mountain. [music]
[32:56] [singing]
[32:56] Oh,

[33:04] fountain.
[33:08] Use his name [music and singing]
[33:10] and your words become the words of a
[33:15] king. [singing]
[33:19] If there's a mountain you want moving.
[33:23] [singing]
[33:24] If there's a giant, it's in your way. If
[33:29] you're [music and singing] in prison,
[33:31] this is your escape. Use that name.
[33:34] [singing]
[33:37] Oh, cuz he's the same [singing] God who
[33:41] spoke to that woman at that well.
[33:47] He's [music] the same God whose wonders
[33:52] are too many [singing]
[33:54] to [music] tell. He's the same God that
[33:59] parted
[34:01] the raging
[34:03] Red Sea.
[34:08] He's the same God
[34:11] that's living [singing]
[34:12] in me.
[34:15] Oh,
[34:17] he's [singing]
[34:18] the same God that spoke to [music]
[34:22] the woman at
[34:25] the well.
[34:27] The same God whose [singing] wonders
[34:31] are too many
[34:33] to tell. He's the same [singing] God who
[34:38] parted
[34:40] that raing
[34:42] red sea.
[34:47] He's the same God
[34:50] that's living in me. [singing]
[34:55] So I use his name.
[34:59] That name [singing and music]
[35:00] opens fountain.
[35:03] Oh,
[35:05] use that name. [music]
[35:08] Oh, [singing] that name it moves every
[35:11] mountain.
[35:14] Use his name.
[35:17] &gt;&gt; [music]
[35:17] &gt;&gt; The words become the words [singing] of
[35:21] a king.
[35:24] [music]
[35:26] If there's a mountain you want moving,
[35:30] if there's a giant [singing] standing in
[35:34] the way, if you're [music] in prison,
[35:37] he's your escape. [singing] Use that
[35:41] name.
[35:43] Oh, [music] I was [singing] in prison,
[35:46] but I escaped
[35:49] cuz I used that name.
[35:54] [singing and music]
[35:58] Thankful. You have a weapon tonight.

[40:33] place. Mighty God,
[40:38] you are awome [music] in this place of a
[40:43] father.
[40:46] Lord, you are [singing and music] worthy
[40:48] of all praise.
[40:50] To you our lives we raise. You are
[40:55] awesome [music] in this place.
[40:58] Oh, sing it to him tonight.
[41:01] Lord, you are [singing and music]
[41:02] awesome in this place. Mighty God,
[41:07] [music]
[41:09] you are awesome in this place of the
[41:13] Father.

[41:22] praise.
[41:24] You're awesome in this [music] place.
[41:28] Mighty God,

[41:35] Mighty God, [music]
[41:39] you are awesome in this place. Aba
[41:43] Father,
[41:46] you're worthy [singing] of [music] all
[41:48] praise.
[41:50] You are lives we raise.
[41:53] You are awesome in this place. might.
[42:00] Amen. Would you say that this evening?
[42:03] Amen. He's certainly wonderful worthy
[42:07] [music] of all the praise that we could
[42:08] utter out of these mortal limbs. Amen.
[42:10] Amen. Certainly, God is a wonderful God
[42:14] worthy to be praised. Amen. We just love
[42:16] the Lord this morning. Sure appreciate
[42:19] all that God does for us. just really
[42:21] enjoyed the service Sunday with Andrew
[42:25] and just allowing the Lord to use him.
[42:28] I've been feeding on that all week. I
[42:30] just really enjoy I enjoy good gospel
[42:32] preaching. So, Amen. So, we always wait
[42:36] to to lift us up and encourage us,
[42:39] establish us, and I believe that's what
[42:41] end time evangelism is. It's to [music]
[42:44] shape the stone. So, we we like to be
[42:47] shaped. Amen. It don't always feel
[42:49] [music] good being shaped.
[42:52] you know, but it's just the way it is.
[42:54] So, we just let the Lord work on us.
[42:56] Amen. We just want to remember this this
[43:00] evening in prayer has a request. Please
[43:01] pray for Tammy Ree. Also, Leah and John
[43:06] Scott remember them in prayer. Also a
[43:09] prayer for Ruth Anne's brother Terry
[43:11] Green needs prayer for his family and
[43:15] don't know them but I believe that
[43:17] certainly God does and knows the need
[43:19] that they have. So maybe if you have a
[43:21] need on your heart tonight want you to
[43:23] just lift your hand to the Lord and
[43:24] maybe you just pray with me over these
[43:27] needs tonight before we approach the
[43:29] word of God. Gracious heavenly father
[43:32] Lord I just thank you for being in our
[43:34] presence here tonight. Lord, I thank you
[43:36] for the word that you've given us to be
[43:38] able to speak, Lord, knowing that it
[43:40] brings [music] life to the hearer. Lord,
[43:43] I just ask you, Lord, tonight that you
[43:45] would touch each one. And God, you know
[43:48] those that need healing in their body.
[43:49] And Lord, we just ask that you would go
[43:52] to where they are. Lord, you know the
[43:54] need of every person, Lord. And Lord, we
[43:57] just rely upon you, Lord, to be able to
[43:59] touch, to lift, to heal, and those that
[44:02] are brokenhearted. Lord, may you touch
[44:04] them, Lord, that [music] just needed
[44:06] healing in their body, Lord. I pray that
[44:07] you would heal them tonight, Lord. May
[44:09] your word go forth, Lord, and be [music]
[44:11] edifying to the body of Christ, Lord,
[44:13] that we would leave this place knowing
[44:14] that we've been in your presence. And
[44:16] Lord, we'll give you the glory for all
[44:17] you do. In Jesus name we pray. Amen.
[44:22] Amen. God bless you tonight. We just
[44:24] want to invite you right to the
[44:25] scripture and in the book of second
[44:28] Timothy the third chapter and we'll read
[44:30] out of the 16th verse and then we'll
[44:33] also read out of Amos the third chapter.
[44:35] So 2 Timothy 3:16 for the sake of time
[44:39] we'll just get right in there and we'll
[44:42] just give a report on
[44:45] Clarabel. She's got weighed a little bit
[44:48] more yesterday and so they said she had
[44:51] to be in the little box for a few days
[44:53] to get her body temperature
[44:55] stay regulated. So we're just trusting
[44:58] the Lord in a few days they'll be able
[44:59] to bring her home. So sure appreciate
[45:01] all your prayers for her as well. uh
[45:04] second Timothy the 3 chapter the 16th
[45:06] verse and the Bible says
[45:09] uh all scripture is given by inspiration
[45:12] of God and it is profitable for doctrine
[45:16] for reproof for correction for
[45:18] instruction and righteousness. How many
[45:20] say amen to that?
[45:22] &gt;&gt; That the man of God may be perfect and
[45:24] thy furnished unto all good works. So
[45:28] because Timothy says all scripture is
[45:31] given by inspiration of God and is
[45:32] profitable for doctrine and for reprove
[45:35] and for correction. I love this part. It
[45:37] says for the man of God. That man that's
[45:39] not just speaking of men. That come from
[45:40] the Greek word anthropos which is
[45:42] speaking of mankind. So we're all
[45:44] included. So all of us are it is good
[45:47] for all of mankind uh the men and people
[45:50] of God to be made perfect furnished unto
[45:53] all good works. So I would like to take
[45:55] another scripture, Amos the third
[45:56] chapter in the seventh verse because all
[45:59] scriptures are inspired by God. How many
[46:01] believe this next one we're about to
[46:02] read is? Amen. So Amos 3 and 7, the
[46:05] Bible says, "Surely the Lord God will do
[46:07] nothing but he revealth his secret unto
[46:10] his servants, the prophets." Amen. How
[46:13] many believes that was an inspired
[46:14] scripture by God? Amen. Certainly if
[46:16] you're a Bible believer, uh you can't
[46:18] help but believe that. So may you take
[46:19] your seats tonight and I would like to
[46:22] speak on this subject. there standeth
[46:24] one among you.
[46:26] &gt;&gt; I really believe this tonight. I believe
[46:28] that our uh that the church I believe
[46:30] we're a part of that great universal
[46:32] body of Christ. And uh it's not just our
[46:35] own assembly, but around the world
[46:38] there's assemblies that gather uh that
[46:40] are a part of this wonderful body or the
[46:42] bride of Jesus Christ. And uh I I count
[46:44] it a privilege to be a part of that and
[46:46] to be able to do our our part as
[46:49] believers. And you know, each one of us
[46:50] that God called us, some to sing, some
[46:52] to preach, some to pray, uh some to
[46:55] worship, some to prophesy, some to
[46:57] testify. We all uh have been given uh
[47:00] gifts of God to be used in the body. And
[47:02] I really think that ought to be our our
[47:04] desire in our life is for God to be able
[47:06] to use the gifts that he's placed uh uh
[47:09] placed among us. And you know, I think
[47:10] about the church today. Uh how many
[47:12] knows that the church that God's church
[47:14] is a prophetic church? Amen. Uh we're a
[47:16] prophetic class of people. We live by
[47:18] prophecy. We believe by prophecy. The
[47:20] the book that we believe to be the word
[47:22] of God is a book of prophecy. And in
[47:25] fact, the the Bible was written by the
[47:27] prophets of old that were that were
[47:28] moved upon by the Holy Ghost. And you
[47:31] know, I was thinking of that this week
[47:33] and thinking of how [snorts] that it
[47:34] seems like the world today or the church
[47:36] world today uh that they that they have
[47:39] changed from being a Christian people
[47:41] following after God and uh the order of
[47:44] which God brings his word to now that
[47:46] they're uh they still have the names of
[47:48] Christianity and still uh uh promote
[47:51] Christianity in some form. But they've
[47:53] gotten away from the order of the way
[47:55] that God directs his church, the way he
[47:57] speaks to his church. And of course, I I
[47:59] don't believe that anything God would
[48:00] ever do would be out of order. I believe
[48:02] if God's in it, then uh God will have it
[48:04] in order. And so, uh there's an order of
[48:06] the church. There's an order of the way
[48:08] that God, uh has an assembly the way
[48:11] that God has his church universally. And
[48:13] uh and you know, it just seems like that
[48:15] today that it has been replaced. They've
[48:17] replaced it with following uh after a
[48:19] church. They follow after committees of
[48:22] men. The doctrines are voted on. Would
[48:24] you think of that? that men actually sit
[48:26] around in rooms and they vote on the
[48:28] doctrines of the church and like it's a
[48:30] political thing to figure out that this
[48:31] is the way we're going to stand or what
[48:33] direction we're going to take with with
[48:35] homosexuality and what direction we're
[48:37] going to take with the uh with the with
[48:39] holiness and what direction we'll take
[48:40] with uh uh with speaking in tongues and
[48:43] they just sit around in in rooms and by
[48:45] committees uh determine what the
[48:47] church's doctrine is going to be and the
[48:48] doctrines over time they've changed
[48:50] they've went from uh uh uh from from one
[48:53] thing to a little loose or too
[48:54] fundamental or or they're constantly
[48:57] changing. It just seems like the world
[48:58] is unsettled uh in what Christianity
[49:01] really is. There's so many
[49:02] interpretations and trying uh uh to find
[49:05] out what a real true word believer ought
[49:07] to be in this age. And uh but but they
[49:09] changed the fundamental beliefs of the
[49:11] church has changed. I don't have time
[49:13] tonight, but if you took through history
[49:15] and you looked at every church and a
[49:16] wonderful people through the whether it
[49:18] be a Methodist or a Baptist church or
[49:20] Pentecostal Church of God or Assembly of
[49:23] God and you went back in the history of
[49:25] the church and uh 50 years ago, a
[49:27] hundred years ago, you'll find that the
[49:29] fundamental doctrines of the church have
[49:31] changed. They changed the way uh they
[49:33] preach about uh uh holiness and
[49:35] standards of the church and the way the
[49:36] church believes. And and I just I just
[49:39] happen to be a believer when God said he
[49:41] was he wasn't going to change and he and
[49:43] he's an unchanging God with unchanging
[49:45] ways. I just happen to believe that God
[49:47] wouldn't come down in this last age and
[49:49] allow us to change the way you know I
[49:51] had a lady tell me one time she said
[49:53] well it's all changed because society
[49:55] has changed what the standard is. I
[49:57] thought my when did we allow society to
[49:59] change the standards of the gospel of
[50:01] Jesus Christ? But but we're not going by
[50:03] a society standard but we're going by a
[50:05] gospel standard. And I believe that God
[50:07] has given it to us and he gave it to us
[50:09] 2,000 years ago, thousands of years that
[50:12] God has brought his word and uh and
[50:14] we're not looking to change it, but uh
[50:16] but we're looking to build upon God's
[50:18] word and to be able to establish upon a
[50:21] foundation that God has already
[50:23] established. And you know, I think about
[50:25] churches today. They become builders.
[50:27] And you know, they're uh they're
[50:28] building for different reasons. Some
[50:30] build for money, some build for a
[50:32] following, some build for uh for fame,
[50:34] they build for prestige. And I'm just
[50:36] laying a foundation for something. I may
[50:37] preach on it for a few weeks, but I want
[50:39] to establish it tonight. But they build
[50:41] for all different reasons. They and they
[50:44] build followings unto themselves or
[50:46] they'll build and uh and force people to
[50:48] follow them and force people to live
[50:50] after them. One goes too far with grace
[50:52] and one goes too far with legalism. And
[50:55] it just seems like we're always looking
[50:57] for the middle the middle of the road
[50:58] and what God really wants out of a
[51:00] church. And I believe that ought to be
[51:01] what we should look for. We we ought to
[51:03] look for the desire of God. And you
[51:05] know, I thought it don't matter if you
[51:06] go too far with grace, it's still wrong.
[51:08] But if you go too far with legal
[51:10] legalism, it's still wrong.
[51:12] &gt;&gt; I thought about how that it is today. It
[51:14] seems that people they they force people
[51:16] to be in a religion and it don't matter
[51:18] where where you go. I've studied a lot
[51:20] of religions and they they have a
[51:21] guideline to live by, a law to live by,
[51:24] and they bring people in and they they
[51:25] sure try to make them fit the law really
[51:27] well. So that's what's going to make you
[51:29] a believer. And and you know, I think
[51:31] that the reality is is that whenever uh
[51:34] whenever you try to force people to live
[51:36] one way or force people to act away or
[51:38] force people to dress a certain way,
[51:40] what you miss is what really matters.
[51:42] And that's a true converted heart and a
[51:45] heart that is surrendered to Jesus
[51:46] Christ. I I believe that that's what God
[51:48] called us to is a true surrendered
[51:50] heart. It ain't it ain't to force people
[51:51] to look like I do or force people to to
[51:54] dress like my wife or look like the way
[51:56] I think that people ought to look. And
[51:58] but that's not what it is. Really the
[52:00] reality is is that we ought to have a
[52:02] surrendered heart and we ought to bring
[52:03] people to what really matters and and
[52:05] that's to be converted. That's to have a
[52:07] true conversion and a pouring out of the
[52:09] old nature and a feeling of the spirit
[52:11] of God. And I can just say this, this
[52:13] ain't just coming from me, but Jesus
[52:15] actually warned of it. When he talked of
[52:17] those Jews and he said that you would
[52:19] travel across seas to make one
[52:21] procelite, he said, "And when you've
[52:23] done it, you've made them a two-fold
[52:24] child of hell." You know what he was
[52:26] talking about? you'd go over to that
[52:28] pagan religion and they're all on their
[52:29] way to hell because they didn't accept
[52:32] Christ. He said, "And then you would go
[52:33] over there and procelite them right to
[52:35] Judaism." And and you know what a
[52:37] proelite, that's not a bad word. I know
[52:39] people today have misused it and and
[52:41] made it a bad word. But a procelite
[52:43] means a new convert. That means you've
[52:45] converted from Hinduism to Christianity.
[52:47] That's a procelite of Christianity or or
[52:50] converted from Muslim to Christianity.
[52:52] That'd be a procelite of Christianity.
[52:54] But what Jesus said, he said, "What made
[52:55] him a twofold child of hell is because
[52:58] you you brought him from paganism and
[53:00] then you brought him to Judaism, but you
[53:02] never brought them to God." He said, "So
[53:03] you prolighted them to the wrong thing."
[53:06] So we don't want to be that kind of
[53:07] person. We don't want to travel across
[53:09] the world and travel across seas and to
[53:12] bring people into our church and try to
[53:14] uh to make them forced to live one way
[53:15] or forced to dress one way or or forced
[53:18] to look one way. All you're doing is
[53:19] putting your religion on them and trying
[53:21] to get them to wear your religion and
[53:23] express your religion. But the reality
[53:25] is they never got anywhere with God. I I
[53:27] I preached this this evening as a
[53:29] warning because when that becomes our
[53:31] focus, suddenly we accept a person that
[53:33] would put on a dress. We accept that
[53:35] they've moved closer to God. In reality,
[53:37] they might put on a dress and never get
[53:39] anywhere with God. So, we don't ever
[53:41] want that to be our standard that
[53:43] whenever we would look at somebody and
[53:45] say, "Well, if I can get them to dress
[53:46] like me and to look like me and to sound
[53:48] like me and to talk like me, well, then
[53:50] they're okay with God. So, I'll stop
[53:51] praying for them. I'll stop testifying
[53:53] to them. I don't have to preach to them
[53:55] anymore because they got where they
[53:57] needed to be." But the reality is that
[53:59] what we see outwardly is is just a but
[54:01] that ain't the real work. The real work
[54:03] is what's being done on the inside. And
[54:05] then what's done on the outside is
[54:07] expressed from a real work that's done
[54:09] on the inside. That's an inward work.
[54:11] &gt;&gt; And a real gifted person, you know what
[54:12] they can do? They can see an inward work
[54:15] that's being done. So, we're not
[54:16] looking. You know, it's easy to look at
[54:18] somebody on the outside and say, "Well,
[54:20] they're not growing real fast and
[54:21] they're not really getting where they
[54:22] need to be." And, you know, it's easy to
[54:24] get judgmental. But a real gift could
[54:26] look on the inside and say, "I noticed
[54:28] they're not the person that they used to
[54:29] be, and God's dealing with their heart."
[54:32] I'm I'm just going to lay this out here
[54:33] because I know how the devil does when
[54:34] you start preaching along this, but we
[54:36] are a church that believes in holiness.
[54:38] I believe that men ought to be men and
[54:40] women ought to be women. I believe women
[54:42] ought to dress according to the
[54:43] scripture of holiness. I don't believe a
[54:45] woman ought to put on garments that
[54:47] pertain to a man. We don't believe that
[54:48] a man ought to put on garments that
[54:50] pertain to a woman. I I I believe in
[54:52] holiness. I believe that men and women
[54:54] ought to conduct themselves as
[54:55] Christians. I I believe they ought to be
[54:57] separate from the world. I I believe
[54:59] that our testimony ought to be worthy of
[55:01] the name of Christianity. I don't think
[55:03] it ought to be a mockery. I don't think
[55:05] that grace ought to be made a disgrace.
[55:07] But I also believe that our main focus
[55:10] ought to be that all of that that takes
[55:12] place in your life that it actually came
[55:14] from a personal relationship with Jesus
[55:16] Christ and not because of a law that men
[55:18] has put over other men. I believe that
[55:21] what that what the prophet said in
[55:22] Isaiah, he said, "Heaven is my throne
[55:24] and the earth is my foottool and what
[55:27] house have you built me?" Sayeth the
[55:28] Lord. That God is looking for a house to
[55:30] dwell in. He said, "Will it be a house
[55:32] that I am pleased to dwell? Will it be a
[55:34] house that that is a sanctified house
[55:38] &gt;&gt; that God is looking for a place to dwell
[55:39] in?
[55:40] &gt;&gt; Let me tell you this. Sanctification is
[55:42] not an outward work. It's an inward
[55:44] work. I know many has put this out there
[55:46] today that that it's an outward work.
[55:48] Sanctification takes place on the
[55:49] outside. But the but all the works of
[55:52] grace are done on the inside.
[55:54] &gt;&gt; Sanctification is an inward work.
[55:56] Brother Ram said, notice he said
[55:57] sanctification the second stage of
[55:58] grace. He said it cleanses the mind and
[56:01] sets the heart, the mind of the heart in
[56:03] the order of holiness. So what good
[56:05] would the body in the order of holiness
[56:07] do if the heart wasn't in the order of
[56:08] holiness? He said see sanctification
[56:10] sets the mind of the heart in the order
[56:13] of holiness. So it's an inward work. He
[56:16] said and a man can repent of his sins
[56:18] and he'll still think. He said if he's
[56:19] an immoral man, every immoral man when
[56:21] he looks at a woman, he finds it. He
[56:24] said in every immoral looking woman he
[56:26] finds, he recognizes that that's still
[56:28] there. Maybe he's a drunk. Every time he
[56:30] smells alcohol, he sees that it's still
[56:33] there. He said, see, but when he gets
[56:35] sanctified, it cleanses that desire out
[56:37] of him and it takes the want of it away.
[56:40] He can still be tempted, but it takes
[56:42] the want of it away, but still yet he's
[56:44] not right. it. Then it would have to
[56:46] take him through the process that he
[56:47] himself, the Holy Spirit himself, the
[56:50] son of God, could dwell in the human
[56:51] heart,
[56:52] &gt;&gt; it has to go through that before he can
[56:55] come into it.
[56:56] &gt;&gt; Before he can come to a place that God
[56:58] could use him, he would have to go
[57:00] through these stages of grace. And I
[57:02] really believe this. Sometimes people
[57:03] get it out of order. And you say,
[57:04] "Brother Matt, why would you get into
[57:05] that a after reading the scriptures that
[57:07] you read?" But it's because the way that
[57:10] churches is built, it's because that
[57:12] what we're we're building, if you build
[57:14] it the wrong way, it will fall apart. If
[57:16] you build it upon legalism, it ain't
[57:18] ever going to stand. You can make
[57:19] everybody live a certain way because you
[57:21] say it. I don't care how loud you say
[57:23] it, how forceful you say it, how quiet
[57:25] you say it, how pretty you say it, how
[57:27] ugly it is. I I if it's legalism, it's
[57:29] legalism. And it has to be an inward
[57:31] work that's done in the heart. You have
[57:33] to put a desire in somebody that they
[57:35] could come to an altar and find God and
[57:37] be and have a heart that is sanctified
[57:39] to the presence of God and be filled
[57:41] with the baptism of the Holy Ghost so
[57:43] that the desire of the world would leave
[57:45] their flesh and they would have nothing
[57:47] else but a desire to please God.
[57:49] &gt;&gt; That's what we really want as a church.
[57:51] &gt;&gt; We want to bring people to that. We want
[57:52] to build the right way. And you know, it
[57:55] reminds me of a story of the builder
[57:57] that went forth to build. you know, and
[57:59] they got out there and he done all the
[58:00] work and went out into the into the
[58:03] quaries and he picked the finest of
[58:05] marble to bring and to build this great
[58:08] building that he was building. And he
[58:10] maybe went out into the other countries
[58:12] and he found gold and precious silver
[58:14] and he found all of these great
[58:16] commodities that he could build. And as
[58:18] he would bring all of this back and
[58:20] start to build it, the people would come
[58:21] and and gather around and see that
[58:23] there's never been something that was
[58:25] built that was so beautiful. It it was
[58:27] the greatest structure that there ever
[58:28] was. It was lined with fine uh gold. It
[58:31] was the curtains were of fine linen. The
[58:34] glass was of of fine glass of rubies and
[58:36] emeralds and carved into glass. And
[58:39] maybe they would come and say, "What are
[58:41] you building? Is this a house that is uh
[58:43] it's it's for a man of great prestige?"
[58:45] No, no doubt. Maybe it's a it's for a
[58:48] man of great wealth that would live in a
[58:49] house like this. Or maybe you're
[58:51] building a great business where it would
[58:53] be the headquarters of something that
[58:55] would uh that would be around the world
[58:57] or maybe uh some great church or
[58:59] something. I mean to to put that much
[59:01] effort into it and that much beauty into
[59:03] it. What is it that you're building? But
[59:05] the man goes on and he gets the building
[59:07] built and it's so perfect that everybody
[59:09] around it could go by and look at its
[59:11] beauty and they they say my how
[59:13] marvelous that it is and boy it sure
[59:15] looks good on the outside. And and then
[59:18] at the end when they're watching to see
[59:20] maybe who's going to move in and what
[59:22] and they're watching to see maybe a
[59:24] caravan would come by and bring a king
[59:26] and in order to live in it. But as
[59:28] they're waiting to see all of a sudden
[59:29] to all their surprise here would come a
[59:32] a procession of a funeral and and
[59:34] they're carrying a body and one's
[59:35] carrying a coffin and the other, you
[59:38] know, playing the instruments of of
[59:40] death and and the incense of death. and
[59:42] they open up the building and inside the
[59:44] building they would lay a coffin and
[59:46] they and maybe lay another and this
[59:48] would be the family burial place or the
[59:50] burial place of some family or something
[59:52] and and see it would be so odd to those
[59:55] around us to see something so beautiful
[59:57] that would be used for something like
[59:59] that. But this is exactly what Jesus
[1:00:02] tells to the Pharisees in Matthew the
[1:00:04] 23rd chapter. He said, "Woe unto you
[1:00:06] scribes and Pharisees, you hypocrites,
[1:00:09] for you are like whited supplers, which
[1:00:11] indeed appear beautiful on the outside,
[1:00:14] but on the inside you're filled with
[1:00:16] dead men's bones and of all
[1:00:18] uncleanness." You see, what he lays as a
[1:00:20] foundation that it don't matter what you
[1:00:21] do on the outside. The first thing you
[1:00:23] must do is make sure there's life on the
[1:00:25] inside and then let the outside reflect
[1:00:28] the life that is living on the inside of
[1:00:30] every one of us. Friends, don't ever
[1:00:31] think that it's okay to put on a garment
[1:00:33] or or or that you're far enough with God
[1:00:36] that if you can look a certain way or
[1:00:37] feel a certain way or or act a certain
[1:00:39] way, but but get a life on the inside of
[1:00:41] you that that has changed that would
[1:00:43] take the desire of sin and the world and
[1:00:46] the flesh out of you. Then there don't
[1:00:47] have to be nobody that correct the way
[1:00:49] you live and follow you around and tell
[1:00:51] you how to act and tell you you
[1:00:53] shouldn't go that way and tell you cuz
[1:00:54] you got a something on the inside of
[1:00:56] you. It ain't somebody behind you. It
[1:00:58] ain't somebody over you. It ain't
[1:01:00] somebody in front of you, but it's
[1:01:01] somebody down on the inside of your
[1:01:03] heart that says, "Don't do that. Don't
[1:01:05] go there. You shouldn't put that on. You
[1:01:07] shouldn't act that way." That ought to
[1:01:09] be where every Christian gets to. That's
[1:01:12] what would make you a real believer. He
[1:01:14] said, "Even so outwardly you appear
[1:01:16] righteous unto men." I'm not preaching
[1:01:18] against preaching holiness. I'm just
[1:01:19] telling you the order of it. He said,
[1:01:21] "Even it ought to be outwardly appear
[1:01:23] righteous unto men, but within you are
[1:01:25] full of hypocrisy and iniquity. God
[1:01:28] forbid that anybody would come into
[1:01:29] church that would be a hypocrite and
[1:01:31] look one way on the outside and be
[1:01:33] another way on the inside. Friend, I
[1:01:35] don't want nobody to be that way. I want
[1:01:37] your life to be right with God. I want
[1:01:39] your the spirit of holiness to be living
[1:01:41] on the inside of your heart that you
[1:01:42] could express outwardly from a
[1:01:44] sanctified life. Something that God got
[1:01:46] a hold of you on an altar somewhere when
[1:01:48] you repented and gave your heart to God
[1:01:50] that your life could express something
[1:01:52] that God has done on the inside of you.
[1:01:54] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. He said, "You hypocrites
[1:01:57] that would garnish the tombs of the
[1:01:59] prophets and the supplers of the
[1:02:01] righteous, but say, if it had been in
[1:02:03] the days of our fathers, we would have
[1:02:04] not been partakers of them that had the
[1:02:06] blood of the prophets on their hands."
[1:02:08] He said, "We you are witnesses unto
[1:02:10] yourself that you are the children of
[1:02:11] them which killed the prophets." Fill
[1:02:14] you up then the measure of your fathers,
[1:02:16] you serpents or generation of vipers.
[1:02:18] How can you escape the damnation of
[1:02:20] hell? Here we would tell them because of
[1:02:23] their outward and all their lawkeeping.
[1:02:25] Notice I'm building something here.
[1:02:27] &gt;&gt; All of their lawkeeping. He said, "But
[1:02:29] you've killed what matters.
[1:02:31] &gt;&gt; You can put all this Christianity you
[1:02:33] want. You can go all the the the church
[1:02:35] services you want. You can post it all
[1:02:37] of how much of a Christian you become,
[1:02:39] but you've killed what matters." This is
[1:02:41] Jesus's word. He said, "You serpents and
[1:02:43] generation of vipers, how can you escape
[1:02:46] the damnation of hell?" I thought what a
[1:02:47] question to ask in this generation is
[1:02:50] how can you escape the damnation of
[1:02:52] hell? What is our way of escape? Don't
[1:02:54] you realize that God has always provided
[1:02:56] his people a way of escape? That there's
[1:02:59] a pattern that God I can I just
[1:03:00] establish a pattern in the days of Noah,
[1:03:02] it was God that sent that that that sent
[1:03:05] the instruction to build an ark that
[1:03:06] when judgment came in the days of Noah
[1:03:08] that his people would be able to to be
[1:03:10] carried across judgment. In the days of
[1:03:13] of Nineveh, it was Jonah that that came
[1:03:15] to Nineveh that brought a message of
[1:03:17] repentance. It was Moses in the days of
[1:03:19] Egypt when the children of Israel were
[1:03:21] in Egypt and and that he would go down
[1:03:23] and and bring a pillar of fire and give
[1:03:25] them away of deliverance out of the land
[1:03:27] of Egypt. It was Jesus that came into
[1:03:29] that spiritual in that spiritual Egypt
[1:03:31] that would bring them out of that
[1:03:32] spiritualism and spiritual bondage into
[1:03:35] the baptism of the Holy Ghost. So you
[1:03:37] realize that God has always provided a
[1:03:39] way of escape.
[1:03:41] Jesus said, "How can you escape the
[1:03:43] damnation of hell?" I thought, "What a
[1:03:45] question." But did you catch what the
[1:03:47] way of escape really was? Because many
[1:03:49] when when we read that, we say, "Well,
[1:03:51] it was the ark or it was the pillar of
[1:03:53] fire or it was deliverance or or or what
[1:03:56] was it?" But notice what it really was.
[1:03:58] But when it was a ark, it was the ark
[1:04:00] that was built by a man named Noah. When
[1:04:03] it was repentance, it was repentance
[1:04:04] that came through a man named Jonah.
[1:04:06] When it was deliverance, it was
[1:04:08] deliverance that came from a man named
[1:04:09] Moses. When it was the Holy Ghost, it
[1:04:12] came from a man named Jesus. So you say,
[1:04:14] "How can you escape the damnation of
[1:04:16] hell?" He said, "Notice what it is." He
[1:04:18] said, "Wherefore, behold, I send unto
[1:04:21] you prophets
[1:04:23] &gt;&gt; and wise men and scribes."
[1:04:26] &gt;&gt; So God's way of escape, notice what
[1:04:28] Jesus lays out that God's way of escape,
[1:04:31] he said, "I send unto you prophets. I'm
[1:04:34] going to provide you a way of escape."
[1:04:35] He said, "I will send unto you prophets
[1:04:38] and wise men and scribes." He says, "So
[1:04:41] his way of escape would always be
[1:04:42] brought through the mouth of prophets.
[1:04:44] Not all would receive them." Because
[1:04:46] watch what Jesus said. He said, "But
[1:04:48] some of them you shall kill and crucify,
[1:04:51] and some of them shall you discourage in
[1:04:53] your synagogues and persecute them from
[1:04:55] city to city." So here he said, "But I
[1:04:57] will send prophets. I will send wise
[1:04:59] men, which was if you study the Old
[1:05:01] Testament, which was called sages, but
[1:05:04] or I will send scribes." It was right
[1:05:05] books. And so all the way through the
[1:05:08] the Bible, we find this to be a theme
[1:05:10] that God uses as a way of escape. Jesus
[1:05:13] said, "I will send unto you prophets." I
[1:05:14] I was reading in the in the in the Old
[1:05:16] Testament and reading how uh that God
[1:05:19] has always sent this. It's always been a
[1:05:21] part of the scripture and and Jesus
[1:05:22] would say this. And so uh how many how
[1:05:25] many is familiar with the word a sage?
[1:05:26] You know what a sage is? A sage was in
[1:05:28] in in the Bible, it was a it was a a
[1:05:30] wise person or someone uh who who
[1:05:33] possessed or imparted wisdom to others.
[1:05:36] &gt;&gt; So the Old Testament is full of of
[1:05:38] people that were sages. They were wise
[1:05:40] men. They were individuals in society
[1:05:43] that would uh that people would seek
[1:05:44] after for counsel or for direction
[1:05:46] because they were wise men. Even today
[1:05:49] in Judaism, there's a need for sages
[1:05:51] because people certainly are looking for
[1:05:53] wisdom. But but there was a difference.
[1:05:55] The difference between a prophet and a
[1:05:57] sage is a sage was a person that could
[1:05:58] look into the past and things that had
[1:06:00] happened and and maybe you could show
[1:06:02] them things that had happened in your
[1:06:03] life and because of their wisdom then
[1:06:05] they could they could say well you know
[1:06:07] this was kind of what happened with your
[1:06:08] father and you know this is the
[1:06:09] direction your ways and that's why you
[1:06:11] feel the way you feel because of because
[1:06:13] of what you expressed to me about your
[1:06:15] dad and your mom and you know that's
[1:06:16] where that came from and and they could
[1:06:18] give them some good instruction on their
[1:06:20] life uh because of the things that had
[1:06:22] happened in their past. But the
[1:06:23] difference between a sage and a prophet
[1:06:25] is a prophet by vision or by by dream
[1:06:27] that God would deal with them and they
[1:06:29] could actually see things that would
[1:06:31] take place in your future. So it wasn't
[1:06:33] regardless of what took place in your
[1:06:35] past, but a prophet could see things
[1:06:37] that was going to happen. So it's
[1:06:38] something that you couldn't tell them.
[1:06:40] You couldn't uh you would have no way of
[1:06:41] knowing. And and so the sage would look
[1:06:43] into the past and the there's more to
[1:06:45] it, but just to but just to to get an
[1:06:47] understanding, they could look into the
[1:06:49] past, but a prophet uh could look into
[1:06:51] the uh uh uh to the future. So a true
[1:06:53] sage, but I want to lay this out
[1:06:55] tonight, but a true sage uh was a was
[1:06:57] always a godly man. Because a if a sage
[1:07:00] was a person of wisdom, then we realize
[1:07:02] according to the scripture that wisdom
[1:07:04] only come from God. So if it was a real
[1:07:06] sage of God or someone that could be
[1:07:08] called that according to the scripture
[1:07:10] uh to be wise it would have to come from
[1:07:12] God. For the Bible says the fear of the
[1:07:13] Lord is the beginning of knowledge but
[1:07:15] fools despise wisdom and or wisdom and
[1:07:17] discipline. So it shows us that true
[1:07:19] wisdom only comes from reverence to God.
[1:07:22] &gt;&gt; So so even even the Bible would say in
[1:07:24] first kings that God gave Solomon wisdom
[1:07:26] exceedingly deep insight and
[1:07:28] understanding beyond measure like like
[1:07:30] the sand on the seashore. Solomon's
[1:07:32] wisdom was greater than all of the men
[1:07:34] of the east. greater than all of the
[1:07:36] wisdom of wisdom of Egypt. So as a wise
[1:07:39] man, we would look back and say, well,
[1:07:40] he could be called a sage because he was
[1:07:42] a wise man. Brother Bam would even call
[1:07:43] Simeon. He said Simeon, he was an old
[1:07:46] sage about 80 years old. So when you
[1:07:48] hear that word, that's what he's
[1:07:49] referring to. An old sage about 80 years
[1:07:51] old, hundreds of years since even there
[1:07:54] had been a prophet on the earth when he
[1:07:55] went walking around. But the Holy Ghost
[1:07:57] spoke to him and said, "You will see the
[1:07:59] Lord's Christ or the salvation of the
[1:08:00] Lord." So, so we realize that that
[1:08:02] they're here that Jesus said there's
[1:08:04] going to come wise men or sages. I'll
[1:08:06] give I'll send wise men. I'll send
[1:08:08] prophets. I'll send scribes. Some of
[1:08:10] them you're going to kill and persecute.
[1:08:11] So, so we can see according to scripture
[1:08:13] that a prophet could be called a sage
[1:08:16] because a prophet was certainly a wise
[1:08:17] man. But not just because you was called
[1:08:20] a sage don't mean you was a prophet. So
[1:08:22] just because he was a wise man and could
[1:08:23] give instruction or direction uh that
[1:08:25] don't mean that it was a prophet. And uh
[1:08:27] but but whenever you when you start
[1:08:29] reading about the prophets of the Old
[1:08:30] Testament, do you realize that upon the
[1:08:33] earth according uh uh down to today that
[1:08:36] there have been hundreds even thousands
[1:08:38] of prophets upon the earth. How many
[1:08:40] knows that there's not just been a few.
[1:08:42] There have been thousands of prophets
[1:08:44] that God has used upon the earth uh
[1:08:47] throughout history. Not more than any of
[1:08:49] us could ever count. and and maybe some
[1:08:51] God used one time and some God used
[1:08:53] several times or you know it used to
[1:08:55] trouble me thinking that uh that that
[1:08:57] that there there couldn't be any other
[1:08:59] prophet there there was only one prophet
[1:09:00] but but but I want you to I'm going to
[1:09:02] show you the difference here in a minute
[1:09:03] so you don't turn you don't turn the
[1:09:05] live stream off just yet but but there's
[1:09:07] been thousands of prophets brother
[1:09:08] brother said there was tens of hundreds
[1:09:10] of prophets uh that God has used but but
[1:09:12] we realize that all the prophets are not
[1:09:14] the same see God sent different prophets
[1:09:17] to different ages to direct his church
[1:09:19] his children with what was taking place
[1:09:21] right in the age that they lived in.
[1:09:22] This has been all the way through the
[1:09:24] scripture. And they would pro prophesy
[1:09:26] of things that would come to pass to
[1:09:28] give the church vision and direction. So
[1:09:31] a prophet's purpose would come to lead
[1:09:33] the church. It would be to give the
[1:09:34] church vision. You know what would
[1:09:35] happen if the church didn't have vision?
[1:09:37] Remember what Proverbs 29:18 which was a
[1:09:39] wise old sage that wrote that without
[1:09:42] vision the people would perish. So there
[1:09:44] had to be vision. And so here God sends
[1:09:47] prophets in order to give vision and
[1:09:49] direction to the church.
[1:09:51] &gt;&gt; Now in the Old Testament, we find this
[1:09:53] when you start reading your Bible. Your
[1:09:54] Bible in the Old Testament actually
[1:09:56] shows it differentiates between minor
[1:09:59] and major prophets. Now as you're
[1:10:01] studying reading the Bible, and I'm just
[1:10:02] going to kind of I'll use this service
[1:10:04] as a foundation, but when you're reading
[1:10:06] through the Old Testament, and I'm going
[1:10:07] to go through some of it over a few
[1:10:09] services, but uh you'll find they break
[1:10:11] it up. One place it'll say the 12 minor
[1:10:13] prophets. Now uh and you they're they're
[1:10:15] listed in the order that they appear in
[1:10:17] the Bible through uh Hosea, Joel, Amos,
[1:10:20] Obadiah, Naam, Habac, Zephani, Haggi,
[1:10:23] Zachariah, Malachi. There are the 12 uh
[1:10:25] minor prophets that are in the Bible.
[1:10:27] But I don't want you to to read that and
[1:10:29] misunderstand what a minor prophet is.
[1:10:31] Because if you would if you most time
[1:10:33] when we use the word minor, we' say it
[1:10:35] was a lesser or or not or or it didn't
[1:10:38] have as much value. But a minor prophet
[1:10:40] was not a less valued prophet. It was
[1:10:42] just a smaller book. That's why we call
[1:10:44] it minor. It was a smaller letter. It
[1:10:46] may have been a chapter or two chapters
[1:10:48] or their ministry wasn't as long. It was
[1:10:50] a it was a shorter or God didn't use
[1:10:52] them for as much as he did Isaiah who
[1:10:54] would be considered a major prophet. So,
[1:10:57] it's not to belittle the prophet, but it
[1:10:59] was a the minor prophet was just it was
[1:11:01] a smaller or lesser or lesser term uh
[1:11:03] that that that he was used in his
[1:11:05] ministry. But then when you read of the
[1:11:07] major prophets, they were um when you
[1:11:09] read as the Bible was laid out, they
[1:11:11] call the major prophets, five major
[1:11:12] prophets, Isaiah, Jeremiah,
[1:11:14] Lamentations, Daniel, and Ezekiel, which
[1:11:16] we realize that that is not actually all
[1:11:18] the major prophets that that God had
[1:11:20] sent in the Old Testament, but that's
[1:11:22] actually speaking of the prophetic
[1:11:23] books. So, so Isaiah, Jeremiah, when
[1:11:26] Lamentations of Jeremiah, Daniel, and
[1:11:28] Ezekiel, those are five major uh
[1:11:30] prophetic books. But we realize that
[1:11:32] according uh to the scripture and and
[1:11:34] that that a Abraham was certainly a
[1:11:36] major prophet of God. Enoch was a
[1:11:39] prophet of God, a major prophet. Noah
[1:11:41] was a major prophet. Moses was a major
[1:11:43] prophet. Elijah, Elisha, there was many
[1:11:45] great prophets of God that we read about
[1:11:48] in the Old Testament, some that didn't
[1:11:49] have a book at all. But when the Bible
[1:11:52] first starts, when you open the Bible,
[1:11:53] from the very beginning, and I'm
[1:11:54] establishing this on purpose, and
[1:11:56] hopefully it's being recorded, but from
[1:11:58] the very beginning of the Bible, the
[1:12:00] very first chapter, the very first words
[1:12:02] that are written in your Bible was
[1:12:04] written by a prophet of God.
[1:12:06] &gt;&gt; And the very last words that are written
[1:12:07] in your Bible in the book of Revelation
[1:12:09] was also written by a prophet of God.
[1:12:11] For from Genesis under Revelation, it
[1:12:14] was written, it was led by God through
[1:12:17] the the God leading men by prophetic
[1:12:20] gifts. And so all the way through the
[1:12:22] Bible, it don't matter what part of it
[1:12:23] you read, you can't get away from God
[1:12:25] using a prophet,
[1:12:28] &gt;&gt; Abraham, Enoch, and brother said, but I
[1:12:30] want to notice this that there's never
[1:12:31] been an age where God gave his people,
[1:12:33] two major prophets at one time.
[1:12:36] &gt;&gt; So this is a good answer to a question.
[1:12:38] So some say, well, there's prophets here
[1:12:39] and prophets there. And they may and
[1:12:41] they may be and they may prophesy
[1:12:42] something and it may really happen. They
[1:12:44] may see a dream and and it may rain
[1:12:46] tomorrow and and it may really be. He
[1:12:48] said, "But there'll never be two major
[1:12:50] prophets at one time." He gave Enoch
[1:12:52] alone, Noah alone, Moses alone, although
[1:12:55] others had prophesied. He said, "But
[1:12:57] only Moses had the word for his age."
[1:13:00] Did you ever notice that? There was
[1:13:01] never two at once. You say, "Well, what
[1:13:03] about Elijah and Elisha?" Elisha didn't
[1:13:06] start his ministry until Elijah was
[1:13:08] gone. They were on the earth at the same
[1:13:10] time. Elisha walked with Elijah, but it
[1:13:12] was after Elijah ascended, then then
[1:13:14] Elisha's ministry began. All of the Old
[1:13:17] Testaments, the prophets, the letters,
[1:13:18] all of their purpose. You notice it was
[1:13:20] all to the same thing. Joshua when he
[1:13:22] when he followed after Moses, that
[1:13:24] Joshua's ministry, it didn't begin until
[1:13:26] Moses ministries ended. Remember Moses,
[1:13:28] my servant, is dead. But now I'm giving
[1:13:30] unto you Joshua commission. So although
[1:13:33] he was on the earth at the same time,
[1:13:34] but there was no two major prophets, but
[1:13:37] shows us there was no two major prophets
[1:13:39] on the earth at one time. says, "See,
[1:13:41] but I want to catch this that all of
[1:13:42] these Old Testament prophets, all all of
[1:13:45] the letters, every every every uh uh
[1:13:47] scripture that you read, every book that
[1:13:49] you read, it was all pointing to one
[1:13:52] place and that was Jesus Christ."
[1:13:54] &gt;&gt; How many knows that when you read about
[1:13:56] all the Old Testament, it don't matter
[1:13:58] what they write and symbol or what's
[1:13:59] written of Israel. You realize that the
[1:14:01] old, this is a Bible study tonight, but
[1:14:03] you realize that the Old Testament is
[1:14:05] actually the book or the story of Israel
[1:14:07] and how it came about. the first five
[1:14:09] books of the Bible that were they
[1:14:11] weren't written by Abraham. They were
[1:14:12] about Abraham, but they weren't written
[1:14:14] by Abraham. They were written by Moses,
[1:14:16] a prophet of God when he when he got
[1:14:18] along with God. And God be to show him
[1:14:20] what happened in the beginning and how
[1:14:22] that the world was created. Although
[1:14:24] Adam certainly a man that God dealt
[1:14:27] dealt with face to face, but it wasn't
[1:14:28] written by Adam. It was written by
[1:14:30] Moses, a prophet of God. And so, we see
[1:14:32] that this was uh how this uh nation was
[1:14:35] established. And God would write this in
[1:14:38] the Old Testament Bible and it would
[1:14:39] show how they began and where they came
[1:14:41] from and the troubles they would go
[1:14:42] through and and in and out of bondage
[1:14:44] and and from Egypt into Babylon in and
[1:14:47] out of trouble following and and it
[1:14:48] would go all the way through this
[1:14:50] captivity into the exile and Babylon
[1:14:52] this Babylonian captivity once and twice
[1:14:55] and and how the kingdom would be
[1:14:57] restored the the the uh I'm I'm making a
[1:14:59] fast work of it but how the temple would
[1:15:01] be built and tore down and built and
[1:15:03] tore down and built again but it was all
[1:15:05] pointing to where the the coming of the
[1:15:08] Lord Jesus Christ
[1:15:10] &gt;&gt; and then in in the in the middle of the
[1:15:12] Bible there's 400 or so years that were
[1:15:15] there was no prophet on the scene.
[1:15:17] &gt;&gt; There was no word that was written in
[1:15:19] that period there was you it was a
[1:15:21] period a lot of things happened in
[1:15:23] history but it was not recorded in the
[1:15:25] Bible. So but then it comes to this new
[1:15:27] place to where what it's pointing to. I
[1:15:30] just think this is so powerful because
[1:15:32] the Old Testament it ends with a prophet
[1:15:35] &gt;&gt; and the New Testament begins with a
[1:15:37] prophet.
[1:15:38] &gt;&gt; But the Bible says that here that when
[1:15:40] you open up the New Testament, it was
[1:15:42] John the Baptist. He was the first one
[1:15:44] that came in the New Testament. But
[1:15:45] notice that when although John and Jesus
[1:15:48] was on the earth at the same time, but
[1:15:50] John's ministry, his public ministry
[1:15:52] started before Jesus's did. And matter
[1:15:55] of fact, it took Jesus coming down to
[1:15:56] where John was and John saying, "I I
[1:15:59] must decrease that Christ might
[1:16:00] increase." He he his commission was to
[1:16:03] introduce Christ to his generation. So
[1:16:05] he had such a I think about John the
[1:16:07] Baptist. He had such a ministry as a
[1:16:08] prophet of God that people actually
[1:16:10] thought John the Baptist was the
[1:16:12] Messiah. He was a prophet. Somebody say
[1:16:13] prophet. I'm just establishing it
[1:16:15] because I may as well fight the devil
[1:16:17] that tries to take that out of the
[1:16:18] church. Isn't it just like the devil
[1:16:20] today that he wants to take that and
[1:16:21] remove it and separate the church of God
[1:16:23] today from God's prophets? I thought,
[1:16:25] I'm just going to give the devil a black
[1:16:27] eye tonight because you can't open your
[1:16:28] Bible without reading about God's
[1:16:30] prophets. I don't care what your dad
[1:16:31] tells you. I don't care what your mom
[1:16:33] tells you. I don't care what your uncle
[1:16:34] or whatever book you read. You can't
[1:16:36] read this book without reading about
[1:16:38] God's prophet
[1:16:39] &gt;&gt; and what God does with his people
[1:16:41] through his prophets.
[1:16:43] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:16:43] &gt;&gt; Said, see, so John the Baptist, his
[1:16:45] commission was to introduce Christ. I
[1:16:47] thought here it would goes from one it
[1:16:49] goes from from from Malachi. He would he
[1:16:52] would speak of the coming of the Lord
[1:16:54] and and then here John the Baptist he
[1:16:56] would introduce it him and his ministry
[1:16:58] was such a great ministry that it
[1:17:01] actually attracted people by the
[1:17:02] thousands by the thousands that came to
[1:17:05] John the Baptist in so much that they
[1:17:07] asked him are you the Messiah? the works
[1:17:10] that he done and the miracles that was
[1:17:12] that was done the the work that was done
[1:17:14] in his life. They would they would come
[1:17:16] among them and say there's never been a
[1:17:18] prophet the like John the Baptist. His
[1:17:20] ministry was so great. Even Jesus said
[1:17:22] it. He said there's never been a man
[1:17:23] that was born of a woman that that has
[1:17:25] that that is risen that is greater than
[1:17:27] John the Baptist.
[1:17:28] &gt;&gt; His ministry was so great that they
[1:17:30] thought he was the Messiah. But John
[1:17:32] when they came to him they even asked
[1:17:34] are you the Messiah? He said no. He said
[1:17:36] this is of whom I spake. He that cometh
[1:17:38] after me is preferred before me, for he
[1:17:40] was before me.
[1:17:42] &gt;&gt; I thought, notice what he's establishing
[1:17:43] here as all the prophets of old have
[1:17:46] been talking about this coming of this
[1:17:47] Messiah, this this this great one. He
[1:17:50] would be a God prophet. Like Moses said,
[1:17:51] he was coming a a prophet. They they
[1:17:54] prophesied of him. And but John said,
[1:17:56] "He that cometh after me, he's preferred
[1:17:58] before me, for he was before me." In
[1:18:00] other words, he's an eternal God. He he
[1:18:02] he's coming after me. But I'm telling
[1:18:04] you, a long time before I ever walked
[1:18:06] upon this earth, he was already here. He
[1:18:08] He knew me before I was born. He knew
[1:18:10] me. He the the mother I'd be born to. He
[1:18:13] knew the what I would be. He knew the
[1:18:15] river I'd be standing on. He knew how
[1:18:17] many would be baptized today. He said,
[1:18:19] he's coming after me. But he was
[1:18:21] certainly before me. He said, "And of
[1:18:23] his fullness have we all received in
[1:18:25] grace of grace. For grace," he said,
[1:18:27] "for the law was given by Moses, but
[1:18:29] grace and truth came by Jesus Christ.
[1:18:31] And no man has seen God at any time. The
[1:18:34] only begotten son which is in the bosom
[1:18:36] of the father. He hath declared him. And
[1:18:38] then the Bible, it tells us when the
[1:18:40] Jews sent the priests and the Levites to
[1:18:41] Jerusalem, they asked John the Baptist,
[1:18:43] "Who art thou? Are you the Messiah? Are
[1:18:45] you the Are you the Christ?" His
[1:18:47] ministry, I want you to catch this. His
[1:18:49] ministry was so great that they thought
[1:18:51] he was God.
[1:18:53] &gt;&gt; They thought he was the Messiah. He was
[1:18:54] the anointed one. Who art thou? And John
[1:18:56] the Baptist, he confessed. He said,
[1:18:58] "Denied not." He said, "I am not the
[1:18:59] Christ." They said, 'Well, what then?
[1:19:01] Are you Elias? Are you the prophet?' He
[1:19:03] said, 'N no.' They said, 'Well, who art
[1:19:04] thou that they may give answer to them
[1:19:06] that sent us?' He said, 'I am the voice
[1:19:08] of one crying in the wilderness, make
[1:19:10] straight the way of the Lord, as said
[1:19:12] the prophet Isaiah. He was such a man of
[1:19:15] God that he wouldn't even take he
[1:19:16] wouldn't even take it upon himself to be
[1:19:18] identified as anything. I I thought,
[1:19:20] isn't that a defining characteristic of
[1:19:22] a true prophet of God? I ain't trying to
[1:19:24] be somebody. I'm not trying to bring
[1:19:26] people to myself. I I'm not trying to
[1:19:28] build a ministry. I'm not trying to draw
[1:19:30] people to me, but look at the one that
[1:19:32] that God sent me. Make straight the
[1:19:34] pathway. He said, he sent me. I'm the
[1:19:36] one that said, "Make straight the way of
[1:19:38] the Lord." As the prophet said, "Oh,
[1:19:40] friends, don't you see?" They come and
[1:19:42] they said, "Well, why would you baptize
[1:19:43] if you're not the Christ and you're not
[1:19:45] Elias and not that prophet?" He said,
[1:19:47] "I'll tell you why. Because I only
[1:19:49] baptize with water. But the one that
[1:19:51] that is standing, he said the one there
[1:19:54] that is standing, there is standing one
[1:19:56] among you that whom you know not. He it
[1:19:59] is who cometh after me and he has
[1:20:01] preferred before me whose shoes I am not
[1:20:04] even worthy to unloose. No matter how
[1:20:07] great his gift was, no matter how great
[1:20:09] his ministry was, no matter how great
[1:20:12] they tried to make him a God and tried
[1:20:14] to make him a Messiah and tried to make
[1:20:16] him the Christ the anointed one, he said
[1:20:18] unto them, he said, "There standeth one
[1:20:22] among you who you know not, and I'm not
[1:20:26] even worthy to unlatch his shoes."
[1:20:29] Friends, let me tell you, John the
[1:20:30] Baptist's ministry was to make known
[1:20:33] Jesus Christ. He said he's not he's not
[1:20:36] just a prophet, but he's more than a
[1:20:38] prophet. He's Christ. He's the son of
[1:20:40] the living God. He's the Messiah. He's
[1:20:42] the anointed one. He's the one that
[1:20:44] Moses spoke of when he said, "There's
[1:20:46] coming one after me." I say, "Prepare
[1:20:49] you the way of the Lord." Make your
[1:20:50] heart ready to receive him. I MUST
[1:20:53] DECREASE THAT CHRIST MIGHT INCREASE.
[1:20:56] &gt;&gt; He's more than a prophet.
[1:20:57] &gt;&gt; He's a God prophet.
[1:21:00] &gt;&gt; But Rem said he was all God and he was
[1:21:02] all man. The one said he was man, he
[1:21:04] said they were right. One said he was
[1:21:05] God, he said they were right.
[1:21:07] &gt;&gt; Said, "See, if you would look at the
[1:21:09] man, you wouldn't even see much."
[1:21:12] &gt;&gt; You know this, brother Ram said, "See,
[1:21:14] because Jesus didn't even heal people."
[1:21:16] &gt;&gt; That's a hard one to think of.
[1:21:18] &gt;&gt; Jesus didn't heal anybody. He said he
[1:21:21] only healed as God showed him to heal.
[1:21:24] &gt;&gt; That's what the Bible says. He says,
[1:21:25] "Surely the son can do nothing but what
[1:21:26] he sees the father doing."
[1:21:29] He said, "So when he stood before the
[1:21:31] people, he could tell them that's the
[1:21:32] reason he knowed he was the son of God.
[1:21:34] They noted he was a son of God. He was a
[1:21:36] prophet that Moses spoke of because he
[1:21:38] was a God prophet." He said, "What do
[1:21:40] you mean a God prophet?" Said, "There's
[1:21:41] a difference. Not all prophets are the
[1:21:43] same."
[1:21:44] &gt;&gt; Said, "See, Jesus was a man. He was just
[1:21:46] a man. He's a virgin-born man." That's
[1:21:47] right. He was the son of God. His father
[1:21:50] was Jehovah, God Almighty. And then
[1:21:52] Jehovah built him a house.
[1:21:54] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. which was his son
[1:21:56] &gt;&gt; to represent himself to the world and
[1:21:59] God was in Christ reconciling the world
[1:22:01] unto himself. Ain't that wonderful?
[1:22:03] Jehovah built himself a house that he
[1:22:06] could come and dwell in that Jehovah
[1:22:08] God. He said he could reconcile the
[1:22:10] world to himself. He said that was God
[1:22:12] in Christ reconciling the world into
[1:22:15] himself. He said but now we have that
[1:22:18] same spirit by measure that he had
[1:22:20] without measure. for the fullness of the
[1:22:23] Godhead bodily dwelt within the Son of
[1:22:25] God. He himself, he was a man, but the
[1:22:27] spirit that was in him was God. He said,
[1:22:30] "You're a man. These are men. We are
[1:22:32] men. I'm a man." He said, "But the
[1:22:34] spirit in us is God, but we only have it
[1:22:37] by measure."
[1:22:38] &gt;&gt; I love this illustration because he
[1:22:40] shows the difference between us and
[1:22:42] between the man Jesus,
[1:22:43] &gt;&gt; who was a God prophet. He said because
[1:22:46] Jesus as a God prophet a as a man the
[1:22:48] son of God the dwelling place of God. He
[1:22:51] said it would be as if the whole ocean
[1:22:54] was in was in one person. He said and
[1:22:57] because he had the whole ocean in him.
[1:22:59] He said then that was the fullness of
[1:23:01] God that was in that one man. Jesus
[1:23:04] said, "But then you could go out in that
[1:23:05] ocean and you could take a spoon of that
[1:23:08] ocean and you could give Brother Mark a
[1:23:09] drink of it and Brother Carter a drink
[1:23:11] of it and Brother Emanuel a drink and
[1:23:13] brother Noah a drink and and you give
[1:23:15] Brother Joe a drink and and each one
[1:23:18] could h have a drink of that same ocean
[1:23:21] and then you could take that water and
[1:23:23] and you could take it down and have it
[1:23:25] analyzed and Brother Connor give you a
[1:23:27] drink and I don't want to leave you out
[1:23:29] buddy but but but you could take that
[1:23:31] and have it analyzed and and when it was
[1:23:33] analyzed, you'd find out the same thing
[1:23:35] that was in the ocean is the same thing
[1:23:37] that was in the spoonful. Do you notice
[1:23:39] when a scientist does a test on water,
[1:23:41] they're not going to go down if they're
[1:23:43] trying to have some problem with a creek
[1:23:44] or a stream and they're trying to figure
[1:23:46] out what's causing it. Maybe there's
[1:23:47] some algae or something that's growing
[1:23:49] in it and they're trying to figure out
[1:23:50] what is causing it. They don't go get
[1:23:52] the whole river and bring it into the
[1:23:53] lab to see what's in it, but they go get
[1:23:55] a little test tube and they scoop up a
[1:23:58] little of it and they take it in the
[1:23:59] laboratory and they dump it in the petri
[1:24:01] dish and they run tests on it to find
[1:24:03] out what is in it and what bacteria is
[1:24:06] growing in it. But do you realize that
[1:24:07] that little part is a sample of what's
[1:24:10] in the hole?
[1:24:11] &gt;&gt; But remember, that's how he explains the
[1:24:13] the the spirit of God. He said, "And
[1:24:15] just like Jesus had the whole ocean." He
[1:24:17] said, "But every one of us," he said,
[1:24:19] "you have a spoonful. You have a
[1:24:21] spoonful. She has a spoonful. She has a
[1:24:23] spoonful. He said, "Then when they go to
[1:24:25] the lab and test, they find out it's the
[1:24:27] same chemical that Jesus had. It's the
[1:24:29] same ocean that he had." He said, "But
[1:24:32] we just got a spoonful of the ocean, but
[1:24:34] it's the same kind of chemical." He
[1:24:35] said, "That's the way the Holy Ghost
[1:24:37] is." He said, "With your spoonful and my
[1:24:39] spoonful and their spoonful and you put
[1:24:41] all of it together, then we can do
[1:24:44] things for God. If we'll just let it
[1:24:46] flow together, it'll bring in the
[1:24:49] presence of God. I thought, my no wonder
[1:24:51] our licks of fire joined together can
[1:24:54] bring the presence of God. He said, but
[1:24:55] if you can bring your spoonful, you can
[1:24:57] bring your spoonful and you can bring
[1:24:59] your spoonful. Brother Mark, you take a
[1:25:01] few believers that could bring that
[1:25:02] spoonful of their little part of the
[1:25:04] ocean. THERE'S A RIVER OF LIFE that's
[1:25:06] flowing out of the church of the living
[1:25:08] God THAT STILL GIVES LIFE TO THE
[1:25:10] UNBELIEVER THAT STILL BRINGS HEALING to
[1:25:12] the SICK THAT OR THE SICK AND BRINGS
[1:25:14] SALVATION TO THOSE THAT ARE LOST.
[1:25:17] &gt;&gt; He said, "But oh man, listen, it'll
[1:25:20] bring the presence of God if we could
[1:25:21] bring our spoonfuls together."
[1:25:23] &gt;&gt; Oh my, it can bring our spoonfuls
[1:25:26] together. He said, "It'll cause it to
[1:25:28] flow together." MY IS THAT YOU GET
[1:25:30] ENOUGH enough water in one place, it
[1:25:33] can't stay there for long. It's going to
[1:25:34] look for a place to flow because it
[1:25:36] wants to move.
[1:25:38] &gt;&gt; You bring it together, it'll bring the
[1:25:40] presence of God.
[1:25:42] &gt;&gt; He said, "But no man at any time
[1:25:44] &gt;&gt; from Adam until Jesus comes again will
[1:25:47] ever be able to perform miracles at his
[1:25:50] own disposal."
[1:25:51] &gt;&gt; He never did. Even the son of God or no
[1:25:54] prophet, speaking of Jesus, it was
[1:25:56] always by divine vision that showed him
[1:25:59] what to do. The Bible said so.
[1:26:01] So don't let no man That's why the Bible
[1:26:03] would say don't be don't be fooled when
[1:26:06] somebody says come over here there's a
[1:26:08] prophet over here come over here's Jesus
[1:26:10] over here and and performing miracles to
[1:26:12] draw people and I'll do this miracle to
[1:26:14] draw people he said because no man
[1:26:16] according to the scripture can perform a
[1:26:18] miracle on his own or at his own
[1:26:21] disposal it's only what he would see the
[1:26:24] father do
[1:26:25] &gt;&gt; by vision can so so notice what happens
[1:26:28] here in this age when I run out of time
[1:26:29] y'all tell me I I'll I'll come back next
[1:26:31] time.
[1:26:32] &gt;&gt; But as long as y'all still listening,
[1:26:34] I'll keep preaching.
[1:26:35] &gt;&gt; But notice what happens. Jesus says in
[1:26:37] Luke's or in the Luke 16th chapter says,
[1:26:39] "The law and the prophets were until
[1:26:41] John." Now, I bring this out because I'm
[1:26:44] going to I'm going to I want to show you
[1:26:45] a false teaching that that is among the
[1:26:47] denominational churches today. The law
[1:26:50] and the prophets is until John. They
[1:26:52] took that scripture and because of the
[1:26:54] spirit of error that that they don't
[1:26:56] read the whole thing because the Bible
[1:26:57] actually says the law and the prophets
[1:26:58] was until John. But since that time, the
[1:27:01] kingdom of God is preached and every man
[1:27:03] pressth into it. That's the whole
[1:27:04] scripture. Says, see, but they think the
[1:27:06] law and the prophets was until John. In
[1:27:08] other words, and so they'll go and say,
[1:27:10] well, no longer no longer is there any
[1:27:13] no longer is there any prophets because
[1:27:15] the law and the prophets was only until
[1:27:16] John.
[1:27:17] &gt;&gt; But Jesus actually speaking, he says,
[1:27:19] but since that time, the kingdom of God
[1:27:21] is preached. In other words, no longer
[1:27:22] that the kingdom of God is coming, but
[1:27:24] the kingdom of God is here. So the
[1:27:27] purpose purpose of him saying that was
[1:27:29] the law and the prophets were
[1:27:30] prophesying of the coming of something.
[1:27:33] &gt;&gt; He says so all the way until John was
[1:27:35] the law and the prophets. He said but
[1:27:37] now since that time the kingdom of God
[1:27:40] is preached which is exactly what John
[1:27:42] the Baptist said. He said repent for the
[1:27:44] kingdom of heaven is at hand. It was
[1:27:47] John the Baptist's ministry. So the law
[1:27:49] and the prophets was bringing us unto
[1:27:51] this place and to where the kingdom of
[1:27:53] God would become present into the earth.
[1:27:55] He said, "But now every man presseth
[1:27:57] into it." In other words, it was the
[1:27:59] presence of a spiritual kingdom. That's
[1:28:00] what the Bible said. In those days came
[1:28:03] John the Baptist preaching saying,
[1:28:04] "Repent for the kingdom of heaven."
[1:28:06] Notice what he was doing. He was
[1:28:07] introducing a spiritual kingdom. It was
[1:28:10] no in no way what he was he trying to do
[1:28:12] away with the prophets.
[1:28:14] &gt;&gt; It had nothing to do with prophets. It
[1:28:16] wasn't he wasn't even talking about
[1:28:18] prophets. He was talking about the
[1:28:20] kingdom of heaven being introduced into
[1:28:22] this world. In no way was he speaking of
[1:28:24] doing away with the prophets.
[1:28:26] &gt;&gt; But the church world today, many
[1:28:28] hundreds of times that I've spoke to
[1:28:30] people that would quote that scripture
[1:28:32] to me when you talk about a prophet and
[1:28:34] say, "But brother, the law and the
[1:28:35] prophets was only until John."
[1:28:38] &gt;&gt; Like, well, you I like how you threw
[1:28:39] that word only in there and kind of
[1:28:41] change the meaning of it, but that ain't
[1:28:42] the meaning of it at all. Matter of
[1:28:43] fact, I want to show you this. I don't
[1:28:45] just want to tell you, I want to show
[1:28:46] you because I want you to have it. And
[1:28:48] it's it's recorded so you can go back
[1:28:49] and look. But but but since the time if
[1:28:51] that's a true statement, the law and the
[1:28:53] prophets was until John. I don't know
[1:28:55] what time it is. Y'all have to tell me.
[1:28:57] But but if that's if that's a if you
[1:28:58] would take that and say, "Well, there's
[1:29:00] no prophets after John." Well, then then
[1:29:01] then all the scriptures that came after
[1:29:04] John would be false scriptures if they
[1:29:06] talked about a prophet, right? So if
[1:29:07] there's no prophets until John, can we
[1:29:09] just put this the can I just put this on
[1:29:11] trial? I'm I'm just gonna bed down right
[1:29:12] here just a minute. I'm gonna put it on
[1:29:14] trial because it's false and and people
[1:29:16] use it every day to to to discourage the
[1:29:19] the people of God.
[1:29:21] &gt;&gt; So So I want you to notice Acts 13th
[1:29:23] chapter. The Bible says, "Now there were
[1:29:25] in the church that was at Antioch
[1:29:27] certain prophets and teachers."
[1:29:29] &gt;&gt; Now this was long after John the
[1:29:31] Baptist.
[1:29:32] &gt;&gt; The church at Antioch is in the church
[1:29:34] there was pro certain prophets and
[1:29:35] teachers. Barnabas and Simeon and Lucius
[1:29:38] and Mania. They were all prophets and
[1:29:41] teachers that were these men. They were
[1:29:43] identified as prophets of God. Even
[1:29:46] it kind of ruffle some folks. But even
[1:29:48] Philillip the evangelist, the Bible said
[1:29:50] Philip had four daughters and all four
[1:29:52] of them were prophets.
[1:29:53] &gt;&gt; And they were Philip he was an
[1:29:54] evangelist. Acts the 21st chapter but
[1:29:56] Abraham said and they prophesied.
[1:29:58] &gt;&gt; They were prophets. It say so you don't
[1:30:00] you Acts 21st chapter and as we tried
[1:30:03] there many days there came down from
[1:30:04] Judea a certain prophet named Agabus.
[1:30:07] Acts 21 and10. So if there was no
[1:30:09] prophet after John, then what was
[1:30:11] Agabus? And why why would they write and
[1:30:14] say there after we terried many days and
[1:30:16] there came down from Judea a certain
[1:30:18] prophet by the name of Agabus? And when
[1:30:20] he was come unto us, he took Paul's
[1:30:22] girdle and he bound it with his own
[1:30:24] hands and feet. And he said, "Thus
[1:30:25] sayeth the Holy Ghost, so shall the Jews
[1:30:27] of Jerusalem bind the man that owns this
[1:30:29] girdle and shall deliver him into the
[1:30:31] hands of the Gentiles." And you know
[1:30:33] what happened when Paul went down? It it
[1:30:35] was a warning for him. The very thing
[1:30:37] that would happen, it was prophesied by
[1:30:39] the Holy Ghost, by a God-gus.
[1:30:43] &gt;&gt; Agabus, he wasn't no church age
[1:30:45] messenger.
[1:30:46] &gt;&gt; He may not been no, he may not been a a
[1:30:49] a major prophet, but he was a prophet of
[1:30:52] God.
[1:30:53] &gt;&gt; So, the the prophets didn't end with
[1:30:55] John the Baptist. How could you believe
[1:30:58] How could you believe that lie that the
[1:31:00] prophets ended with John the Baptist
[1:31:02] after John the Baptist? God don't use
[1:31:03] prophets. Will friends, I'm I'm just
[1:31:05] going to lay one more out there. This is
[1:31:06] a little one. But what about Paul?
[1:31:09] &gt;&gt; There was a messenger to the Ephesian
[1:31:11] church. But said Peter was granted the
[1:31:13] authority to open the doors of the
[1:31:14] Gentiles, but it was given to Paul to be
[1:31:16] their apostle and prophet. He was the
[1:31:18] prophet messenger to the Gentiles, his
[1:31:21] prophetic office by which he received
[1:31:23] the full revelation of the word for the
[1:31:24] Gentiles, authenticated him as their
[1:31:27] apostolic messenger. And to this even
[1:31:29] the other apostles at Jerusalem agreed.
[1:31:31] Remember what Paul said, Romans 11, he
[1:31:33] said, "I speak to you Gentiles in so
[1:31:35] much as I am the apostle of the
[1:31:38] Gentiles, I magnify mine office."
[1:31:41] &gt;&gt; You said, "Well, does that make a Paul a
[1:31:42] prophet?" Well, let's just let's just
[1:31:44] read it. Acts 20th chapter, Paul said,
[1:31:46] "Take heed unto yourselves, and all the
[1:31:48] flock which is of the Holy Ghost hath
[1:31:50] made you overseers. Feed the church of
[1:31:52] God." It's a warning to the shepherds.
[1:31:55] Feed the church of God which he hath
[1:31:57] purchased with his own blood. that the
[1:31:59] Holy Ghost has made you overseers of
[1:32:01] God's flock. Paul said, "For I know
[1:32:03] this, that after my departing shall
[1:32:06] grievous wolves enter in among you, not
[1:32:08] sparing the flock. And after your
[1:32:10] ownelves shall men arise, speaking
[1:32:12] perverse things to draw away disciples
[1:32:14] after them." Can I ask you a question?
[1:32:16] When Paul said, "For I know this, this
[1:32:19] is going to happen after I'm gone." How
[1:32:21] did he know that?
[1:32:22] &gt;&gt; Come on now.
[1:32:24] &gt;&gt; Somebody tell me, how did he know what
[1:32:25] was going to take place after he was
[1:32:27] gone? Let me tell you, how would he know
[1:32:30] the future? How would he know what would
[1:32:32] take place? What would cause Paul when
[1:32:34] he was sitting in the in the prison cell
[1:32:36] that day? And the Bible, remember when
[1:32:38] the Bible says they were down there
[1:32:39] praising and all and praying and all of
[1:32:41] a sudden the earth did shake and and and
[1:32:44] the and the prison bars opened up and in
[1:32:46] the darkness of the night that the
[1:32:48] prison guard sitting there thought in
[1:32:51] his heart that he was going to be in
[1:32:53] trouble cuz the prisoners would escape.
[1:32:55] But while he thought in his heart, he
[1:32:57] heard the voice of Apostle Paul say,
[1:33:00] "Don't worry, jailer, but we're all
[1:33:02] still here." Can I ask you friends, in
[1:33:04] the middle of the darkness, there was no
[1:33:06] lie. HE DIDN'T SAY IT. HE TAUGHT IT IN
[1:33:09] HIS HEART. BUT WHAT WOULD CAUSE A MAN BY
[1:33:11] THE NAME OF PAUL to know WHAT A JAILER
[1:33:13] WAS THINKING in his heart? Don't worry,
[1:33:15] BUT WE'RE ALL STILL HERE.
[1:33:18] &gt;&gt; We have not escaped or not in trouble.
[1:33:20] And the Bible says because of Paul
[1:33:22] expressing in front of him that that
[1:33:24] jailer gave his heart to the Lord. He
[1:33:26] went out and he fixed their wounds. He
[1:33:28] gave his heart, his family, they were
[1:33:30] saved BECAUSE HE SEEN THE SUPERNATURAL
[1:33:32] TAKE PLACE in his life.
[1:33:34] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:33:35] &gt;&gt; Jesus said they will be made known,
[1:33:37] &gt;&gt; but you'll kill them. You'll slay them.
[1:33:40] Many of them you'll mock. You'll
[1:33:42] persecute them.
[1:33:44] But not all persecuted them. Paul the
[1:33:46] prophet in Ephesians the fourth chapter
[1:33:49] he said he gave some apostles he gave
[1:33:51] some prophets. Can I ask you this? Who
[1:33:54] gave and when did he give them?
[1:33:57] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:33:58] &gt;&gt; Who gave and when did he give them?
[1:34:00] &gt;&gt; Yes sir.
[1:34:01] &gt;&gt; He gave some prophets apostles. Can I
[1:34:03] just read it?
[1:34:04] &gt;&gt; He said but unto you unto you every one
[1:34:07] of us is given the grace according to
[1:34:08] the measure of the gift of Christ.
[1:34:10] Wherefore he saith, when he ascended up
[1:34:12] on high, he led captivity captive, and
[1:34:16] he gave gifts unto men. Now that he
[1:34:19] ascended, who's he?
[1:34:21] &gt;&gt; Christ.
[1:34:22] &gt;&gt; Who else ascended?
[1:34:23] &gt;&gt; Now that he ascended, what is it? But he
[1:34:26] that also descended first into the lower
[1:34:29] parts of the earth.
[1:34:30] &gt;&gt; He said, but now the same that has
[1:34:32] descended has ascended up far above the
[1:34:34] heavens, that he might feel all things.
[1:34:37] This is the he we're talking about,
[1:34:38] Jesus.
[1:34:39] He said, "And he gave some apostles and
[1:34:43] some prophets."
[1:34:44] &gt;&gt; This same Jesus. This is after John.
[1:34:47] John introduced Jesus. He said, "But he
[1:34:49] descended. Then he ascended." He said,
[1:34:51] "And after he ascended that he might
[1:34:53] fill all things, and he gave some
[1:34:55] apostles and some prophets and
[1:34:58] evangelists and pastors and teachers,
[1:35:00] speaking of the gifts that would come to
[1:35:01] men." He said, "For the perfecting of
[1:35:03] the saints, for the work of the
[1:35:04] ministry, and for the edifying of the
[1:35:06] body of Christ." Amen.
[1:35:08] &gt;&gt; Just what Jesus said, "Behold, I send
[1:35:11] unto you prophets." Paul came right
[1:35:14] around and said he gave unto you
[1:35:17] apostles and prophets. The very thing
[1:35:20] Jesus said he would do, Paul said that
[1:35:22] he did. Until we all come, you say,
[1:35:24] "Well, when's it going to end?" And Paul
[1:35:25] says, "Until we all come into the unity
[1:35:27] of the faith and of the knowledge of the
[1:35:29] Son of God, unto a perfect man, under
[1:35:31] the measure of the stature of the
[1:35:32] fullness fullness of Christ, that we
[1:35:35] henceforth may be no more children,
[1:35:37] tossed to and fro, and carried about
[1:35:39] with every wind of doctrine by the
[1:35:40] slight of men and cunning craftedness,
[1:35:42] whereby they lie and wait to deceit." So
[1:35:45] when God sent a five-fold ministry, he
[1:35:47] sent it for our perfection. I wonder how
[1:35:49] many say this tonight. He sent it for my
[1:35:51] perfection. Somebody say, "My
[1:35:52] perfection."
[1:35:54] So that means when he sent an apostle,
[1:35:55] he sent it for what? For my perfection.
[1:35:57] Can you accept that? When he sent a
[1:35:59] prophet, he sent it for what? For my
[1:36:01] perfection. When he sent a pastor, he
[1:36:03] sent it for what? For my perfection.
[1:36:05] When he sent a teacher, he sent it for
[1:36:06] what? For my perfection. When he sent an
[1:36:09] evangelist, an apostle, he sent it for
[1:36:10] what? He sent it for my perfection.
[1:36:13] &gt;&gt; And God hasn't changed.
[1:36:15] &gt;&gt; See, there's always, you realize there's
[1:36:17] always been a prophet messenger in every
[1:36:19] age from the time of Paul until now.
[1:36:23] Not just prophets, but brother Mark,
[1:36:25] from the time of Paul, there's been a
[1:36:27] word prophet, a prophet messenger.
[1:36:28] Brother B, I'm going to end with this
[1:36:30] tonight because it's going to get into
[1:36:31] way too much that I can get to, but he
[1:36:34] says, "Now, I do not deny that people
[1:36:35] will prophesy in this last age, and
[1:36:37] their ministries can and will be
[1:36:39] correct. I do not deny that there will
[1:36:41] be prophets, even as in the days of
[1:36:43] Paul, when there was one like Agabus, a
[1:36:45] prophet who prophesied of a famine. I
[1:36:48] agree that it is so. But I deny upon the
[1:36:50] infallible evidence of the word that
[1:36:52] there is more than one major prophet
[1:36:54] messenger who will reveal the mysteries
[1:36:56] as contained in the word and who has the
[1:36:58] ministry to turn the hearts of the
[1:36:59] children to the fathers. That's thus
[1:37:01] sayeth the Lord. By his unfailing word
[1:37:04] it stands and he shall stand and be
[1:37:06] vindicated. There is one prophet
[1:37:08] messenger unto this age.
[1:37:10] &gt;&gt; It don't mean that there ain't prophets.
[1:37:12] It's easy to look. Isn't there a prophet
[1:37:13] here? Didn't somebody say this guy was a
[1:37:15] prophet? Didn't shouldn't this one be?
[1:37:16] He said, "I don't deny that there's
[1:37:18] prophets and I don't deny that God don't
[1:37:20] use them. And I don't deny that it ain't
[1:37:22] correct, but there's only one prophet
[1:37:23] messenger to every age.
[1:37:25] &gt;&gt; There's only one. And in this day that
[1:37:27] God would the Bible said in this day,
[1:37:29] let me show you in the scripture just to
[1:37:31] be something to feed on till we come
[1:37:32] back. In this day, God would send the
[1:37:35] spirit of Elijah." Malachi 4:5. And that
[1:37:37] same spirit that was on John the
[1:37:39] Baptist, remember what he said? Behold
[1:37:41] the lamb of God which taketh away the
[1:37:43] sin of the world. He said, what did he
[1:37:44] do? He was declaring his presence. In
[1:37:47] other words, he was making him known.
[1:37:48] Friends, can I tell you something
[1:37:50] tonight in closing? That's the only way
[1:37:52] God can ever do anything for you is for
[1:37:54] you to recognize he's here. What good
[1:37:56] would a God be if he was Jehovah Gyra or
[1:37:59] Jehovah Rafi or Jehovah Nissi, a healer,
[1:38:01] a banner, a provider? If he was your
[1:38:03] peace, if he was your shepherd, what
[1:38:05] good WOULD ALL OF IT DO IF HE WASN'T
[1:38:07] HERE among us? It's no wonder that
[1:38:08] Ezekiel when he whenever he would talk
[1:38:10] about the the the city of Jerusalem, he
[1:38:13] said it was beautiful on the east, it
[1:38:15] was beautiful on the west and there was
[1:38:16] a great name written and the name of
[1:38:18] this tribe was written here. AND HE'S
[1:38:20] BEGIN TO DEFINE how beautiful and how
[1:38:22] perfectly it was built. BUT THE VERY
[1:38:24] LAST WORDS THAT EZEKIEL EVER SAID, HE
[1:38:26] SAID, "BUT THE NAME UPON THE CITY shall
[1:38:28] be that the Lord is there." IT'S JEHOVAH
[1:38:32] SHAMA. WHAT GOOD WOULD ALL of it be if
[1:38:34] he wasn't here?
[1:38:36] &gt;&gt; He said, "The Lord is here." here. I
[1:38:37] thought what a declaration it is. The
[1:38:40] Bible said he's the same yesterday as
[1:38:41] the music players want to come. He said
[1:38:43] he's the same yesterday, today, and
[1:38:45] forever. How many believes that? He said
[1:38:47] that means then how would he act today?
[1:38:49] He would act today just like he did
[1:38:50] yesterday. Isn't that right? So where is
[1:38:53] he at tonight? He's sitting on the right
[1:38:55] hand of the majesty, his body. But the
[1:38:57] spirit is here in the building to make
[1:39:00] him known.
[1:39:02] &gt;&gt; Is here in the building just to make him
[1:39:04] known. I thought what a declaration. You
[1:39:08] know why that people don't see him?
[1:39:09] Because they don't look for him in the
[1:39:10] right way.
[1:39:12] &gt;&gt; They're looking by prophecy.
[1:39:15] They're looking for the hour when he
[1:39:17] would come. Remember what they asked
[1:39:18] that one day? The Greeks came and they
[1:39:20] said we would see Jesus.
[1:39:23] And as Jesus look, look at his answer.
[1:39:25] He said, "The hour has come the son of
[1:39:27] man should be glorified." He said, "I
[1:39:29] say unto you, except a corner of wheat
[1:39:30] would fall into the ground and die, it
[1:39:31] abideth alone. But if it die, it'll
[1:39:33] bring forth much fruit. speaking of his
[1:39:35] own death and burial and resurrection
[1:39:37] testifying of his purpose said but for
[1:39:39] this cause I came unto this hour father
[1:39:42] glorify thy name and then out of heaven
[1:39:45] he heard a voice said I have both
[1:39:47] glorified it but I will glorify it again
[1:39:51] in other words this wasn't the end of
[1:39:53] this ministry this isn't the end of it
[1:39:56] he's I have glorified it [music] I will
[1:39:58] glorify it again you have seen it
[1:40:00] &gt;&gt; but you will see it again
[1:40:03] &gt;&gt; watch closely did you notice it was a
[1:40:04] Greek. Wasn't the Samaritan. It wasn't
[1:40:06] the Jew. They both saw those Messiah
[1:40:09] signs. But a Greek wanted to see it. And
[1:40:12] Jesus knew now wasn't the time. That was
[1:40:14] the Gentile. Now wasn't the time for you
[1:40:16] to see it. But there's coming a time.
[1:40:19] See, they looked
[1:40:21] by prophecy. That's why they could
[1:40:23] recognize him. It was prophesied that he
[1:40:26] would come. For hundreds of years, it
[1:40:28] was prophesied he would come. But do you
[1:40:30] realize that today that as the gentile
[1:40:33] people begin to look for the coming of
[1:40:35] Christ that we don't look to see him
[1:40:37] with the same prophecy that the Jew or
[1:40:39] the Samaritan and look to see him? See
[1:40:42] their prophecy was
[1:40:44] from the prophet Micah out of Bethlehem.
[1:40:47] There will come a ruler of Israel. That
[1:40:49] was the Jews prophecy.
[1:40:51] A virgin shall conceive. You realize
[1:40:53] that's not your prophecy.
[1:40:55] &gt;&gt; She already did.
[1:40:56] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:41:00] He was wounded for our transgressions.
[1:41:03] [music] The chastisement of his peace
[1:41:04] was it was a prophecy, but he already
[1:41:09] [music] did.
[1:41:11] &gt;&gt; A star will announce his birth.
[1:41:14] &gt;&gt; That was a prophecy, but it's not ours.
[1:41:17] &gt;&gt; He'll be born in a manger. That was a
[1:41:19] Bible prophecy, but it's not ours.
[1:41:23] &gt;&gt; David said he'll say, "My God, why has
[1:41:24] thou forsaken me?" But that's not ours.
[1:41:27] We're not looking for Jesus to come and
[1:41:29] say, "Why has thou forsaken me?" We're
[1:41:32] not looking for him to die on a cross.
[1:41:35] Our prophecy isn't the same one. You see
[1:41:38] why so many failed to see him? Why is it
[1:41:40] hard to see Christ today? Because they
[1:41:42] take the prophecy that was meant to the
[1:41:44] Jew and to the Samaritan and try to
[1:41:47] apply that to today and say, "That's how
[1:41:48] I'm going to see Jesus." [music] But the
[1:41:50] Greeks said, "I would see Jesus." Look
[1:41:52] at how he said, "Here's the answer." He
[1:41:54] said, "I have both glorified him and I
[1:41:56] will again." Man, there's coming an age.
[1:41:58] There's coming a time. Well, he will be
[1:41:59] made known.
[1:42:00] &gt;&gt; See, you're if you're still looking to
[1:42:02] see him in that way, you'll never see
[1:42:03] him. You said, "Brother Matt, well, how
[1:42:05] can I see him today?" Well, you got to
[1:42:07] get the right prophecy.
[1:42:09] &gt;&gt; Let's go back and read our prophecy.
[1:42:11] Malachi Malachi 4 and5. Behold, I will
[1:42:14] send unto you Elijah the prophet before
[1:42:16] the coming of the great and dreadful day
[1:42:17] of the Lord.
[1:42:19] &gt;&gt; Luke 17 and30. That's our that's our
[1:42:21] prophecy that's speaking to this age.
[1:42:23] Revelations 10:7, the voice of the
[1:42:25] seventh angel, when he shall begin to
[1:42:27] sound, the mystery of God would be
[1:42:29] finished.
[1:42:30] &gt;&gt; See, we're not looking for nail scarred
[1:42:32] hands.
[1:42:33] &gt;&gt; Brother Mark, we're not looking for
[1:42:35] we're not looking for a a crown of
[1:42:37] thorns to be placed upon his head, but
[1:42:40] we're looking for the word of God to be
[1:42:42] manifested
[1:42:43] &gt;&gt; in human flesh.
[1:42:45] &gt;&gt; We're looking for a ministry that would
[1:42:46] come in this age that would fulfill
[1:42:48] Malachi 4 and5. Just like the Bible
[1:42:50] said, in the beginning was the [music]
[1:42:52] word. The word was with God and the word
[1:42:53] was God. It was made flesh. It dwelt
[1:42:55] among us. Then that seed went into the
[1:42:57] ground just like Jesus said. It came
[1:42:59] back in the form of the Holy Ghost and
[1:43:00] now the same works that Jesus done is
[1:43:02] being done in the church.
[1:43:05] &gt;&gt; And it looked like it died one day in
[1:43:08] those dark ages. But brother said all
[1:43:10] that happened. He said it had to go into
[1:43:12] the ground just like every seed in order
[1:43:13] to bring forth. It had to go in the
[1:43:15] ground to bring forth. He said the
[1:43:17] church had to do the same thing.
[1:43:19] Whenever c whenever the spirit of God
[1:43:20] fell upon the church, he said even the
[1:43:22] bride had to go through the dark ages
[1:43:24] and to be buried that it could be
[1:43:26] brought forth in this age.
[1:43:28] &gt;&gt; He said in any grain that goes in the
[1:43:30] ground, it must die. He said that great
[1:43:31] church on the day of Pentecost by the
[1:43:33] sending of the Holy Ghost had to suffer
[1:43:35] martyrdom, go into the dirt into the
[1:43:36] earth to bring forth again in the age of
[1:43:38] Luther and come out in the full stature
[1:43:40] of the bride of Jesus Christ for this
[1:43:42] last day. Therefore, the bride and the
[1:43:44] rapture will come forth and there it's
[1:43:46] all pre-planned by God and all backed
[1:43:49] up.
[1:43:50] &gt;&gt; Ain't that powerful?
[1:43:54] &gt;&gt; God can't even lose it.
[1:43:56] &gt;&gt; He ain't like that. He ain't like that
[1:43:57] guy that lost his Bitcoin,
[1:44:00] put it on a drive and it's buried out in
[1:44:01] a dumpster somewhere and now he can't
[1:44:03] find it. God ain't like that. When he
[1:44:04] puts something valuable, he backs it up
[1:44:07] &gt;&gt; to make sure it happened. He said God
[1:44:09] put it there and he backed it up with
[1:44:10] his word. Then he performed it. here in
[1:44:13] this age that we would see that same
[1:44:15] gift of God. And how many how many knows
[1:44:17] that whenever that we would see him
[1:44:20] here? I I thought about John the
[1:44:21] Baptist. You realize as a as a
[1:44:24] fulfillment of of Elijah, the the spirit
[1:44:26] of Elijah that was upon him that only
[1:44:28] one time that John the Baptist stand in
[1:44:30] the presence of Jesus and declare him to
[1:44:32] be here.
[1:44:33] &gt;&gt; One time he he stood in his presence. He
[1:44:36] said, "Behold the lamb of God."
[1:44:38] But you know that brother Brandham
[1:44:39] hundreds of times would stand in an
[1:44:42] audience of people not just once but
[1:44:44] hundreds of times and declare he is
[1:44:47] here.
[1:44:48] &gt;&gt; The very same thing that John the
[1:44:49] Baptist declared once time after time
[1:44:52] after time he would stand and declare
[1:44:55] it.
[1:44:56] &gt;&gt; He said that's if you want to stand to
[1:44:57] your feet. He said that's right. He is
[1:44:58] here now. I'm not going to read them
[1:45:00] all. He said I believe we'll see him.
[1:45:03] Don't you? He said he's here now. His
[1:45:05] power is moving. He said, "Now look for
[1:45:07] him. He's here." He said, "But he'll
[1:45:09] only reveal himself to those who believe
[1:45:11] him."
[1:45:13] &gt;&gt; He's here. He's here to make you well.
[1:45:15] He's here to heal. He's here to do all
[1:45:17] things. He said, "Let's say, praise be
[1:45:19] to God, for he's here and he's ready and
[1:45:22] he's willing.
[1:45:24] &gt;&gt; He's here to bless you. He's here. Jesus
[1:45:28] Christ, the son of God.
[1:45:30] &gt;&gt; He's in the building."
[1:45:32] &gt;&gt; You say, "How do you see him?" You got
[1:45:33] to look for him the right way.
[1:45:36] Stop looking for nail scarred hands and
[1:45:38] crown of thorns and and some robed flesh
[1:45:41] to walk in among you. He said, "He's
[1:45:42] here. Jesus Christ, the son of God. He's
[1:45:45] in the building." I love this. This
[1:45:47] young man,
[1:45:49] he would come to the prayer line and
[1:45:52] brother began to speak to him. He said,
[1:45:54] "What do you think about all this? All
[1:45:57] this he's here declaring him people's
[1:46:00] lives being discerned. What do you think
[1:46:02] about all this?" He said, "Do you
[1:46:04] believe the Lord Jesus Christ to be the
[1:46:06] son of God? That he's raised from the
[1:46:08] dead?" He said, "Yes, sir." He said, "Do
[1:46:10] you believe that he's here now and that
[1:46:12] his works that it's his works and not
[1:46:14] ours?"
[1:46:16] "Yes, it's his works. It's not mine."
[1:46:20] See here what he was looking for a man
[1:46:22] to believe that he was here. He was a
[1:46:24] gentile boy. He was looking to see the
[1:46:27] sign, the sign of the Messiah. I want to
[1:46:30] know that he's here. He said, "Do you
[1:46:32] believe that he's here?" now and that
[1:46:33] it's his works. It's not my works. It's
[1:46:35] his. Do you believe that? He said, "Yes,
[1:46:37] I believe it to be his." He said, "Well,
[1:46:39] you've got heart trouble and rheumatic
[1:46:41] fever." And let me tell you, young man,
[1:46:44] you didn't just get that. You got it
[1:46:45] when you was in the Navy. You was a
[1:46:47] sailor, wasn't you? He said, "When you
[1:46:48] was in the Navy, you picked up that
[1:46:50] rheumatic fever." He said, "That's where
[1:46:52] you got it." Isn't that right? Yes. He
[1:46:54] said, "But tonight, right here at this
[1:46:56] altar is where you're going to leave it.
[1:46:59] &gt;&gt; You got it in the Navy, but you're going
[1:47:00] to leave it right here at Calvary." I
[1:47:02] thought, my what was it? It was that
[1:47:04] same Messiah standing in the presence
[1:47:07] in the presence of a man. Brother Mark,
[1:47:09] it was a a man, a flesh man that was
[1:47:12] mistakes just like you and I. But in the
[1:47:15] heart of that man, in the life of that
[1:47:16] man stepped in the angel of the Lord and
[1:47:19] begin to declare and use his lips,
[1:47:21] &gt;&gt; a prophet that being used by that that
[1:47:24] that same angel of the Lord that would
[1:47:26] say that you're a sailor. What else
[1:47:27] could tell a man that he was a sailor
[1:47:28] and his fever came from a from from his
[1:47:31] uh stint in the Navy? He not only could
[1:47:33] he tell him where he got it, but he told
[1:47:35] him where he was going to leave it.
[1:47:37] &gt;&gt; This is where the spirit got on you. But
[1:47:39] today, this is where the spirit leaves.
[1:47:41] If you can just believe that he is here
[1:47:44] &gt;&gt; and that it's not my works, that it's
[1:47:46] his works.
[1:47:48] It was the order of recognizing a
[1:47:51] prophet and the true purpose of a
[1:47:54] prophet, friends. Not just any prophet.
[1:47:56] It was a prophet. He was displaying a
[1:47:58] messiah sign, a messenger of this age.
[1:48:01] He wasn't just some ordinary man. He
[1:48:03] didn't just have a dream one day and
[1:48:05] have a vision one day and say something
[1:48:06] that came to pass. I'm talking about a
[1:48:08] prophet that was like an unos,
[1:48:11] the angel of the Lord being manifested
[1:48:13] in human flesh.
[1:48:16] just a man
[1:48:18] that God sent prophets and evangelists
[1:48:20] and teachers and pastors.
[1:48:22] I don't neglect the gift that God puts
[1:48:25] in this age. And so, what was the
[1:48:27] purpose of it? To give vision to the
[1:48:29] church. I wonder how many can say this
[1:48:31] tonight. I got I got a good series ahead
[1:48:35] of me. And how many can say this tonight
[1:48:37] that I can declare that he is here?
[1:48:40] &gt;&gt; That you've recognized that sign as not
[1:48:43] being the sign that a man I I I just
[1:48:45] can't I just can't bring myself to it,
[1:48:47] brother. I can't bring myself to giving
[1:48:50] a man enough credit to have that kind of
[1:48:53] ability for people to say that that's
[1:48:56] just a man and you're all man followers.
[1:48:58] For people to say that or giving more
[1:49:00] credit to a man than I could ever give
[1:49:02] because I can't look at that and say
[1:49:04] that a man could have that ability. I
[1:49:06] don't believe that a man could have that
[1:49:07] kind of ability. But it could only be a
[1:49:10] God in a man that could do that. I
[1:49:13] couldn't look at you and tell you where
[1:49:14] you're from, but I know what the Bible
[1:49:16] said. The Bible says the Holy Ghost is a
[1:49:18] discerner of the thoughts and the
[1:49:20] intents of our heart. And that same Holy
[1:49:22] Ghost that was there in the in the upper
[1:49:24] room is the same Holy Ghost that was
[1:49:26] standing on that platform that said it
[1:49:28] was romatic fever and it came from the
[1:49:30] Navy. That's where you picked it up. And
[1:49:32] friends, I'm going to tell you that same
[1:49:33] Holy Ghost is here. And he discerns the
[1:49:36] thoughts and the intents of our heart.
[1:49:37] He don't cause us to stand up here and
[1:49:39] try to copy brother Brandham's gift and
[1:49:41] try to be him. There ain't going to be
[1:49:43] another one of them. There was only one.
[1:49:45] But I'll say this tonight that that same
[1:49:48] Holy Ghost still discerns the thoughts
[1:49:49] and intents of our heart. And by the
[1:49:51] preaching of the word of God, he directs
[1:49:53] us. He leads us. He guides us as a body
[1:49:56] of believers. And one of these days,
[1:49:58] that same Holy Ghost will lead us right
[1:50:00] into the rapture of the church. Friends,
[1:50:03] don't you turn loose of it. Don't lose
[1:50:05] faith in what God is [music] doing in
[1:50:07] this hour.
[1:50:08] &gt;&gt; God has always used a prophet.
[1:50:11] &gt;&gt; It'll always be by a prophet.
[1:50:13] &gt;&gt; As the way of escape, it always came
[1:50:16] through the mouth of a prophet of God.
[1:50:18] Why would it be in the last age, in the
[1:50:21] worst time that there ever was? You mean
[1:50:23] through every age, [music] God used a
[1:50:25] prophet to lead his church? Through
[1:50:27] every age, through every trial, through
[1:50:29] every through every problem that they
[1:50:31] ever faced, God always used a prophet.
[1:50:33] But now we come down to the latest, the
[1:50:36] last age for the greatest trial and the
[1:50:38] worst of all ages and and the greatest
[1:50:41] trial and the greatest persecution that
[1:50:42] there would ever be on a church. And now
[1:50:44] God is going to neglect the church and
[1:50:47] say, "I'll do it in every age, but not
[1:50:49] in this room." No, friends, even in this
[1:50:52] age. It was our promise in this age. And
[1:50:56] I say this, he is here.
[1:51:00] &gt;&gt; That same [music] Messiah sign, he's
[1:51:02] here. present among the church today.
[1:51:05] Prove to us through the mouthpiece of a
[1:51:07] prophet of God,
[1:51:09] &gt;&gt; a word messenger that God sent [music]
[1:51:11] in this age to point us back to Jesus
[1:51:13] Christ. Not to follow after some church,
[1:51:15] but to follow a true a true [music]
[1:51:19] revelation
[1:51:20] &gt;&gt; of the Holy Ghost. He is here. He's
[1:51:23] among his church. How many believe that
[1:51:25] tonight?
[1:51:27] Oh yes, he is
[1:51:30] here.
[1:51:33] Hallelujah.
[1:51:37] He is here.
[1:51:40] Amen.
[1:51:43] He is here.
[1:51:47] Oh, holy, [singing] holy.
[1:51:51] I will bless [music]
[1:51:54] his name
[1:51:56] again.
[1:51:58] He is here. Listen
[1:52:03] [music]
[1:52:04] close to me.
[1:52:07] Hear him calling
[1:52:09] [music and singing] out your name.
[1:52:13] He is here.
[1:52:17] You can touch him.
[1:52:20] You [music] will never
[1:52:24] be
[1:52:25] seen.
[1:52:30] I sense [singing]
[1:52:32] [music] an awesome moving
[1:52:35] of the Holy Spirit.
[1:52:42] And I see his countenance [singing]
[1:52:47] that is resting [music]
[1:52:48] on each face.
[1:52:54] And I [music] know that [singing] there
[1:52:57] are angels
[1:52:59] standing all around [singing]
[1:53:03] us.
[1:53:05] For the presence of the Lord is in this
[1:53:11] place.
[1:53:15] For he is here.
[1:53:19] Hallelujah. [music]
[1:53:23] He is here.
[1:53:25] Amen.
[1:53:28] He is here.
[1:53:31] Holy,
[1:53:33] holy.
[1:53:35] I will bless [music] his name again.
[1:53:41] He is he
[1:53:45] closely.
[1:53:48] Hear him calling [music and singing] out
[1:53:51] your name.
[1:53:53] He is here.
[1:53:56] You can touch him. You will never be the
[1:54:05] same. [music]

[1:54:14] is our God. [music]
[1:54:17] Sing with me how great
[1:54:20] is our God. And all will see how great

[1:54:50] how great [music]
[1:54:53] is our God.
[1:54:58] Oh, [music and singing] I know the
[1:55:00] splendor of the King
[1:55:07] mesty.
[1:55:10] Let all the [music] earth rejoice.
[1:55:13] All the earth rejoice.
[1:55:17] He wrapped himself in love.
[1:55:23] He want this child to have
[1:55:28] tr
