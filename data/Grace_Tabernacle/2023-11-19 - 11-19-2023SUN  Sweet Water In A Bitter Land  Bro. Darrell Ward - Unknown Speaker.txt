you so I love so he's so good to me well God is so good my God is so good God is so good he's so good to me wow isn't that the truth this morning you remember that day or that evening that he came to you and he found you your life was all messed up I Remember December the 21st 1981 2:00 in the afternoon he found me in an old barn by myself been out drinking the night before had a pretty rough hangover but all at once I felt him come into the room and I I knew was him because I felt him when I was a boy and a voice spoke to my heart and said if you go out that door I'll never call you again and it was that afternoon that I found a good God who can take alcohol out of your life who can take drugs out of your life who can take pain out of your life there is no God like our God what a privilege it is to serve the Living God we greet you this morning in the name of the Lord Jesus kind it's such an honor to be with you once again we appreciate brother Matt allowing us to to come this way I I I know you could have some some great man to minister this weekend and yet he let us come and we certainly appreciate that and if you have your Bibles turn with us to the Book of Exodus we going to read from Exodus chapter 15 starting at verse 11 we bring greetings to you from our family and our pastor back home and we just trust something to be said to help you and encourage you along the way that's truly the the reason that we came if you're here today and you have a need I want you to look this way and believe don't look to me but Look to Him amen if if I could I would i' if I had the ability I'd heal every person in this building but I can't I'm just a man but he's God Amen he can do exceedingly above all that we could ever hope for amen I want to read from Exodus chapter 15 starting at verse 11 the Bible says this who is like unto thee Oh Lord among the gods who is like the Glorious in Holiness fearful in Praises doing wonders Verse 18 the Lord shall reign forever and ever for the horse of pharaoh went in with his chariots and with his Horsemen into the sea and the Lord brought again the Waters of the sea upon them but the children of Israel went on dry land in the midst of the sea amen and maram the prophet of a sister of Aaron took a timal in her hand and all the women went out after her with timal and with dances and Mariam answered them sing ye to the Lord for he hath triumphed gloriously the horse and his rider hath he thrown into the sea so Moses brought Israel from the Red Sea and they went out into the Wilderness of shur and they went three days into the Wilderness and they found no water and when they came to morah they could not drink of the Waters of morah for they were bitter therefore the name of it was called morah and the people murmured against Moses saying what shall we drink and he cried unto the Lord and the Lord showed him a tree which when he had cast into the waters the waters were made sweet and there he made for them a statue and an ordinance and there he proved them and he said if thou wil diligently hearken to the voice of the Lord thy God and will do that which is right in his sight and will give ear to his Commandments and keep all of his statues not just the ones we want but all of his statues I will put none of these diseases upon upon thee which I have brought upon the Egyptians for I am the Lord that Health thee Amen Let Us bow our heads I want to speak to you for a few minutes this morning on Sweet Water in a bitter land Heavenly Father Thy word is true I commit this congregation and myself into your hands For Your Glory in Jesus name God bless you Saints you may be seated now in our scripture reading that we read to you this morning it opens with a declaration of how great our God is and i' like to say this morning that he is that there is no God like our God there are many gods in the world today that's exactly right people take a sports Manan or some kind of musician or a politician and will make a God out of them people make Gods out of their cars and out of their jobs and out of their homes there's all kinds of gods in the world today but I stand here with this declaration that there is no God like our God the Bible says in Isaiah 469 remember the former things of old for I am God hallelujah and there is none else I am God and there is none like me he is the true and living God you know Brother David Siler I heard him say one time he was over in India and he said he saw a man take a piece of wood or a piece of brass or something like that and he fashioned him out of God and Brother David said I watched that man set that God Down and Worship the God that he made with his hands and Brother David said as I was watching him do that I thought to myself I'm so glad that I don't serve a God that I made with my hands but I serve a God who made me with his hands and I'm so glad that I stand here today Hallelujah not a god of imagination but we have been made by the hands of almighty God created for such a time as this this is our day this is our hour This is Our Moment friends he called us for this day amen oh my there is no God like our God he is the true and living God I'm so glad that we serve a God not a dead God of stone or or a god of that that has no ability to answer back that we could pray to that we could cry out to but he cannot answer back to us I'm so glad that I don't serve a god of someone's imagination but we serve a God today who has the ability to answer back we serve the Living God he is Almighty he is all powerful he is full of Mercy he is love amen and we can cry out to this God and he hears our cry and he sees our tears and our God has the ability to answer back Jeremiah 33:3 says call unto me sayith the Lord and I will answer thee not could be not hope so not maybe but he said if you cry to me I will answer you you said oh is that true the Bible says so remember when Moses was at the burning bush and he said why have you not delivered your children why have you not heard the Cry of your children what did God tell Moses I have surely seen the Affliction of my people I have heard their cry Hallelujah and I am cut down to deliver them amen hallelujah call unto me he said and I will answer thee you think of Jonah in the belly of a whale a man who had more symptoms more circumstances against him than any man I know anybody here ever been swallowed by a fish Jonah was swallowed by a fish but what did he say he said I cried out to the Lord I cried by reason of my Affliction unto the Lord and he heard me out of the belly of Hell cried I and thou heardest my voice David said in Psalms he said in my distress I called upon the Lord and I cried under my God and he heard my voice out of his Temple and My Cry came before him even into his ears who is like thee Oh God among the gods who is like thee glorious in Holiness fearful in Praises do doing wonders and let me say wonders he did he brought his children out of bondage notice he went there he told Moses go down there tell go down there tell Pharaoh Moses go down there and tell Pharaoh I didn't come to steal your slaves but you go tell Pharaoh I have come to deliver my children Israel is my son hallelujah amen wonders he did he brought the children out of bondage with a mighty hand and he drowned Pharaoh's Army the greatest army to that date and he drowned them in the sea he sent 10 plagues upon Egypt Egypt had all kinds of gods but they had 10 of the famous gods and God trumped everyone of their gods to prove he was the true and Only God he sent 10 plagues for the 10 most famous Egyptian gods you believe that he turned the water of now into blood seven days the Egyptians had a God by the name of hapi ha a pii the god of the Nile he turned the Nile to blood but their God couldn't turn it back oh come on somebody frogs came out of the river and the Egyptians had a god named hetat h e k t the Egyptian goddess of fertility water and renewal and the head of this God is the head of a frog lies from the dust of the earth and the Egyptians had a God by the name of Gab GB the god of the earth swarms of flies God created swarms of flies and brought them up the earth and the Egyptians had the god called k h e p r i the god of creation ashes turned to balls and sores and the Egyptians had a god named Isis the God of medicine it rained hell out of the sky and turned the fire upon the earth and the Egyptians had a god named nut which I think all of their gods were nut that's right the goddess of the sky three days of darkness in Egypt and Egypt had a God by the name of Ray R A which was the god of the sun he proved every God of the Egyptians was a dead God hallelujah and that he was the true and living God and he came down to deliver his people and I'm so happy to tell you this morning the same God that delivered them is the same God that'll Deliver [Applause] Us and when maram saw that her enemy was dead she got into the spirit she grabbed a tambourine and went up and down the bank dancing and shouting amen amen my my the prophet of God said it's shocking isn't it no to think about it an oldfashioned Revival amen said Mary got in the spirit grabbed up a tambourine went down the bank dancing said kind of shocking isn't it dancing beating on a tambourine and the daughters of Israel followed her beating tambourines and dancing in the spirit he said if that ain't an oldfashioned Revival I don't know nothing about it what does it spell victory Hallelujah there laid their dead there laid those dead ones on the bank washed up the ones that had beat them who had abused them who had treated them like dogs and there they lay dead and when she saw those bodies float up on the bank it was time to shout it was time to dance her enemy was dead her enemy Was Defeated well I tell you brother darl when I get to heaven I'm really going to shout and dance well that' be good I'd like to see that sometime well when I get there brother darl I'm really going to shout and I'm really going to dance but I say to you this morning if you can see the promises of God are for you if you can see he's your deliverer if you can see he's done spoke you in a Rapture did you hear what I say he's done spoke us as far as God is concerned we've already raptured amen hallelujah he's our deliverer he's done spoke us in a rapture we have a pillar of fire a prophet messenger we're in an Exodus I say if you can see all those things I'm telling you we can shout now we can dance now our enemy is [Applause] defeated the prophet of God said we are dealing with a defeated enemy sickness is defeated death is defeated hell is defeated everything is defeated Oh my he said I wish I was twice my size maybe I'd feel twice is good this morning we're disputing with the conquered enemy you see it all the time people come up for prayer they said well the devil told me this and the devil said that they can't tell you good two good quotes but they can tell you everything the devil said to them this week and sometimes I wonder why do you even listen to him you know he's a liar come on somebody why do you even listen to him you're you're trying to debate with a defeated [Applause] enemy you so well brother darl that might be pretty good for brother Matt and brother Mark and brother Joe but you know I'm just the least one in the church I'm just the souls of the feet of the body of Christ well that may be true but you're still in the body I'm just the souls of his feet yeah but I have a quote for that you said brother Bram I'm the least one that's the souls of his feet but remember he's triumphed with you he's triumphed with you over every bit of it even if you're the souls of his feet even if you're the S if you're the skin on the little toe of the body of Christ every sickness every devil every Power even death itself it's under your feet oh my it's under you glory how don't I don't he said I don't feel like I'm 52 this morning this is the truth if I can just get the church to see that brother we'll be a Triumph trunch Believers in him all evil all evil under your feet look at your feet this morning go ahead look at them what's underneath them don't see the carpet don't see the concrete you know what you should see this morning every devil under your [Applause] feet years ago when my daughter Ally was just a little old thing I was preaching up in Kentucky she's about this High she's standing beside me outside and I was talking to the brother and Ally was standing there just a little old thing you know she goes and I looked at her I thought what in the world and I said something else she goes and I looked at her I said Ally she goes I said Ally what in to work you're ruining my Ministry what are you doing she said it's a bug Daddy it's a bug and I looked down there's a bug run around she's trying to stop that bug that's what you need to do this morning you need to realize that your enemy is nothing but a bug and somebody in this church ought to stop him under their [Applause] feet you need to tell Satan you are under my feet and on the banks of the Red Sea they were having a Hallelujah big time after a great Victory here they go through the Wilderness they're on their Journey marching shouting praising God following the message of a prophet following the pillar of fire on their way to a Promised Land being led by a God who can not fail they are being led by a God who done told them when you come to this mountain you will worship me on this mountain so as far far as God was concerned they were already there and here they go through this Wilderness shouting screaming praising God having a Revival following a God who could not fail three days into the journey they find their first test they find theel in a desert place with no water three days they marched all the families all the cattle the animals the mules coming out of Egypt a single day in the wilderness without water would have been tolerable two days would have been difficult but three days would be impossible especially for children and the Animals anybody ever been thirsty I I remember one time I was in the Army and we got caught out unexpectedly On Maneuvers and I didn't get no water in my canteen and was out there in the hot sun it was hot and I was so thirsty I thought I was going to die and I asked a total stranger someone i' never seen in my life sir can I have a drink of your water you said why would you do that what if he had some kind of disease I was thirsty anybody ever been that thirsty amen amen but you know what he done he never gave me the water he said I just have enough for myself and to be so thirsty and after three days of marching no water someone up ahead yells water there's a fountain of water and just At The Mention Of that water they begin to break RS Maybe the little ones begin to run ahead maybe the animals begin to smell it and begin to run towards the water and the one that got there first it got down and he got him some water three days I've got water he go get back get back don't drink it what Lord what what what's wrong it's bitter get the kids back get the animals back might make them sick can't drink it no water but you see three days without water you would about drank anything but notice catch this God made this water so bitter that they could not drink it and sometimes God will make a trial so hard the water will be so bitter that you can't expect nothing less than a miracle that God wouldn't make the trial so hard the test so hard that you would look nowhere else there would be nowhere else you could look to but [Music] him bitter Waters think about that the disappointment of finding water only to realize it was bitter would only make the situation worse it would have been better to find no water at all than to find water that you couldn't drink think about that it would have been better not to even seen it but to look upon the Water to see it perhaps it wasn't bloody perhaps it was clear perhaps it was sparkling it was so enticing it was so inviting but they could not drink it it would only make the situation worse to be so thirsty to be so dry the dust from the desert the sweat the weariness to find the water and it's bitter and you can't drink it to hear your children say mama please please let us have some of that water no honey mama can't let you drink it please Mama I'm so thirsty no no mama I can't let you drink it why would he do that why would he lead us to water and it'd be bitter we're his people we follow his message we listen to his Prophet yeah why the bitter water and they cried out which means the land of bitter water in their anguish they actually named that place bitter Waters just three days before 72 hours before they were singing shouting dancing beating tambourines talking how great their God was now three days 72 hours later they're murmuring and complaining and scared and upset the very ones that were shouting the very ones that were standing up in church clapping the very ones that was hollering amen and Glory Hallelujah now those very ones were murmuring and complaining how soon they forgot the Red Sea Revival how quickly their countenance changed when they arrived in Morra the bitter land and it's in those worst moments come on when the doctor says I'm I'm sorry when you lose your job the bitterness comes in your marriage disappointments situations turns against you it's those moments when you get weary it's those moments when you get down that Satan likes to take advantage and start spewing out his lies you say lies is does not the Bible say he's the father of them it's when he finds US weak and weary and depressed and disappointed that he really likes to jump on your back he really likes to pour it on you can you imagine the lies that tempted to overtake them when Satan began to talk to them this God of yours delivered you out of Egypt were you had food you had water to drink to leave you three days in a desert to die and then tempt you with water that you can't even drink some God you serve some cruel God you serve and it's in those moments it was in that moment that every fear surfaced and all they saw was death it was a bitter situation indeed you see the devil only wants you to see the x-rays and the MRIs he only wants you to see the drug addiction the marital situation the fear the pain the No Way Out situation he wants you to see the storm but he doesn't want you to see the sun I flew on many of flights going different places to preach I've got on an airplane when it's been raining I've been on an airplane when the sky was dark and gloomy and cloudy been on the plane when it was sleeping and snowing and you get on that plane and you take off and as it breaks up through the atmosphere coming through those clouds the plane will shake and drop and bump but I'm telling you once you break through those clouds every time I've ever been on that flight when I break through that cloud guess what I see I see the sun shining and I don't care how dark it would be how great the storm would be if you can get above the clouds you'll find the sun don't look at the storm look at the son amen you see the devil wants you to see your prison house he wants you to see the bars on your prison house come on somebody I'm telling you he wants you to see the bars on the door of your prison house but what he don't want you to see is that door has been opened hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah oh my thank you Lord notice the Red Sea was a water problem and God fixed it so if our God can fix one water problem can he fix another if he can take care of one water problem can't he take care of another notice the Red Sea and the bitter water was both water problems what are you saying I'm saying this if he can heal skin cancer he can heal bone cancer liver cancer breast cancer brain cancer if he can bring one prodal home he can bring all prodal home if he can fix one marriage he can fix yours if he delivered you once has he ever delivered you if he delivered you once cannot he do it again I say yes he can I say yes he can but all they saw was death and bitter undrinkable water in a desert place and the people mumedi the very ones that was shouting and beating on tambourines was now saying what are we supposed to drink Moses what shall we drink following a prophet's message where's that goddess the people murmured against Moses saying what shall we drink you see think God was leading him to the promised land that he said was theirs God don't change his mind about his word if God said it God will do it listen to me God don't keep his word 99 times out of 100 but the prophet said 100 times out of a 100 God will keep his word men may lie to you governments M lay to you politicians May lie to you preachers May lie to you come on somebody but the word of God will never lie to [Applause] you if a man says thus say the Lord and the Lord didn't say it that man's worthy of Hell come on somebody cuz you're telling God if you say God said it and it don't happen you're making God out to be a liar and my God don't lie I said my God don't lie here a few years ago this the Church of Christ wanted to come they heard what the Lord did for Jessica and they wanted to come and debate me about Divine Healing I said boys you come too late to tell me that you come too late to tell me God don't open blinded eyes and make the lame walk you've come too late they said well God don't do that no more I said I'm sorry that your God Is So puny that he can't heal but my God hallelujah my God could still heal he can still deliver he can raise the Dead he can cast out Devils come on somebody that's my God today Hallelujah God was leading him to the land that he always said was THS he'd already said it's your land then why why would he not bypass the bitter water wasn't it Phillip was it philli that was caught up in that that that great Revival and he went out into the desert to find that unic wasn't that Phillip and didn't the spirit of the Lord after he witnessed to this Ethiopian and Ethiopia took the word of God back to his people didn't the spirit of God catch that man away and I think one place the prophet said he showed up in the city of zotus or something like that something like 29 miles away that's a pretty good trip right there so if God could lift up one man and set him in another place can he lift up two million so why didn't God just lift them up and place them in the land why the bitter water why wouldn't he bypass that land but you see he led them right straight to that bitter water but where the Israelites didn't see a way where they didn't see a way God did the test for the isites was a question of faith in what they couldn't see you see if you understand something and see something and figure it out that ain't Faith that's knowledge and God was wanting Israel to see not with the eyes of their head but with the eyes of their hearts the prophet said in look into the Unseen he said we we are told we have an outer man and an inner man and the outer man looks by his eyes and the inner man walks by faith so we have to be led by one of these two persons the outside outer man is South but the inner man is God and the Bible says in 2 Corinthians 5:7 for we walk by faith and not by sight you see you can either walk by faith or you can walk by sight but you cannot walk by both at the same time and God was wanting to to look with the eyes of their heart not what they saw with their head you see without the bitter Waters there would have been no opportunity for God to perform a miracle that day see you got to understand that every Miracle every Miracle starts with a problem well brother Dar I've got a problem you're a candidate for a miracle we live in such a Negative age everything's Negative they call her red light a stop light why do they call it a stop light you go as much as you stop unless they call it a go light absolutely well glory amen but you see without a problem there could be no Miracle there have been no opportunity for God to perform a miracle that day and the most difficult situations in our life are opportunities for God to do the miraculous and to turn our bitter situations sweet to show us just how great he is that's right you see the murmurings against God what did it do it made Moses C cry out to God yes notice while ago when we read about Jonah he cried out to God but why did he cry out to God he said I cried out to God by reason of my afflictions and many times I wonder if God don't allow things to come into our life so that we'll cry out to him because you know as well as I do none of us pray like we should when everything's going good you might as well say Amen or out you know it's the truth we're all human but the murmuring against God made Moses cry out and if you want to have your Mariah if you want to have your bitterness healed then take the case To God In Prayer you see God begins by making us begin the people complain to Moses Moses took the complaint to his master in all the trials of her life in all the testings in our life the surest way to have victory is through prayer the prophet said prayer is the most powerful weapon ever placed into the hand of human beings the power of prayer man nor demon can stand before prayer H is that not true is that true buddy in India when there's a cyclone coming is that not true that they even put it in the paper miraculously this city survived why because some Believers was on their knees crying out to God it didn't even rain the power of prayer to th Hallelujah to turn a storm man nor demon can stand before your prayer well brother Daryl I can't pray like brother Matt and I can't pray like brother Mark and I can't pray like brother Joe I can't listen to me ain't nobody can pray like you can pray God built each of us the way he wants to use us and we'll deal with things brother Joe in our life we will deal with things that others may never have to deal with but God will allow those things to come to mold us in a way that he wants to use us prayer is more powerful the prophet said than an atomic bomb you know they Dr an atomic bomb in World War II on Hiroshima and nakasaki I believe it's how you say it and even today there are people being born with birth defects from the radiation of those two bombs 70 some years later people are still being affected by a bomb that was dropped before many of us in this building was ever born and if an atomic bomb can do that what can your prayer do when the prophet said your prayer is more powerful than an atomic B [Applause] there was a sister in that church named sister Etho Clark she's gone to the glory now oh you talking about a prayer Warrior that woman was a prayer Warrior she was my Sunday school teacher when I was a little boy and she got sick and one night me and Sheryl after church stopped by the house to see her went in and sat down sister clark told me she said yeah Lord she always said yeah Lord she said yeah Lord when you was a little boy in my Sunday school class she said I saw God had his hand on you and she said I prayed for you because I knew God was going to use you all these years I prayed for you and I got in the car and I begin to cry sure said what's wrong I said think of it when I was an idiot a total idiot running up and down the road drinking doing drugs God had a Godly woman praying for me Hallelujah maybe your mama pray for you maybe she G but that Prayer Will circle the Earth but one day it'll find you in a bar it'll find you in somewhere the prophet of God said the weakest Christian gets down on their knees to pray all hell trembles I say there's enough here to give hell a nervous [Applause] breakdown as soon as you have a prayer God has a ribon here Moses Cried unto the Lord Lord and the Lord showed him a I got to hurry and the Lord showed him a tree which he cast into the waters and the waters were made sweet and there he made for them a statue and an ordinance and there he proved them think about this the answer to their bitterness the answer to the bitter water the answer to the situation they was in was always there well before they ever knew they had a problem God done had the answer you know years ago I was preaching down in Louisiana they took me up to Alexandria to get on a plane to fly home and I sit and I'm I'm I'm Platinum Status with Delta I fly with them so much I get all kinds of upgrades so I got upgraded to this seat and I had my already had my seat too much in advance where I was going to sit so I come got on the plane sat in the seat that was assigned to me I man come sat down beside me he said you from around here I said no sir from up in Tennessee he said what brings you down here I said I'm a preacher oh you're a preacher I said yes sir he said well since you're a preacher let me ask you a question I said well buddy I ain't the sharpest knife in the drawer but if I can help you I'd be glad to help you he said my daughter was getting her kids ready to bring me to the airport and he said I was looking on the internet and he said I came across something so unusual I'm going to ask you about it I said 'w sir if I can help you I'd be glad to do it he said have you ever heard of a man named William brandom I said yes sir his grandkids go to my church this guy let me we talked no no no no let me let me make that right we didn't talk he talked all the way to Atlanta he was so excited and we shook hands on the tarmac and he went one way and I went the other and I was walking down through Concourse there and I got to thinking my my my ain't that something yeah two months think about it two months before that man ever knew he had a question God done have the answer sitting beside him and let me tell you friend your answer is in this building this morning it's always been here we're two or three Hallelujah when two or three are gathered in my name I will be in their midst [Applause] the answer was already there the tree had been growing for years the answer to your fears the answer to your sickness the answer to your problems was here before you ever had the problem you see there's two P there's two reports before you yeah there's a doctor's report and there's Isaiah's report now I worked 17 years in surgery if you've got time I can tell you while they call it practiceing medicine and people will put so much confidence in their doctors and please don't misunderstand me if I'm sick I go to a doctor and you should too amen amen but when the doctor says he can't help me I know someone who can because when the doctor says he can't do it and then God does it it makes a great testimony they even put it on YouTube called the healing of Jessica Ward everything they said she couldn't do God said she could and people will put so much well my doctor said this and the doctor said that and listen sometimes the doctor's report is 100% correct and sometimes it ain't that's we had a man that came in for a prostate test and they called him up and said sir you have prostate cancer you need to come in so we can get started on it he said well I've got a cattle farm down here in Greenville said I need a few days to get somebody take care of my cattle they said well get it took care of you need to come in we need to get started on your treatment the man writes a note to his family and he says I would rather die by a bullet than die from cancer and he goes out into his field and he takes his own life 3 days after the funeral the hospital called his family and said we made a terrible mistake the report that was on your husband's chart belonged to someone else your husband has no cancer at all but he believed the doctor's report he believed it to the point he took his own life but just think if he'd have took that belief and turned it towards God's promise how much better off he would have been so what do you saying I'm saying this sometimes doctors are right sometimes they ain't they do the best that they can do but there's another report called Isaiah's report Hallelujah and that report has never been wrong [Applause] Hallelujah the doctor's report are Isaiah's report whose report will you believe as for me in my house We Shall Believe the report of the Lord his report says I'm Healed his report says I'm sealed I will believe God's [Applause] report oh brother I hear what you're saying but my problem my problem you don't understand my problem listen you may not see the sweet and the bitter yet but hold on and have faith God works all things good to bring about the sweet according to Romans 8:28 all things work to the good even we don't understand why and many times God don't even ask us to understand why he just says can you trust me TR that's good I remember the night of the accident when two of my family was killed and my baby was laying up there dying and my wife was so upset she was shaking her I could still see it in my mind her hands was shaking I went and got a garbage can so she could throw up she was so sick at her stomach and she was crying she said I don't understand she said you're going all the time preaching you're never home and God would do this to us God would allow us to go through this she said I don't understand and I grabbed her by the hands I said listen honey I don't understand either but sometimes God don't ask us to understand he just says can you trust me can you trust your God he makes no mistakes and if you can trust him even though you don't understand it if you can trust him there comes a release there comes a release oh God amen the next time you come into your moral the next time you come into that desert place instead of panicking have faith that the god you serve is the god who will turn the bitter water sweet for you for the glory of his name you see in the desert places God shows his greatest power in desert places comes the greatest Miracles God chose them to bring them to a place where they had to rely on and trust him completely completely instead of looking to the water for life he wanted them to look to him you see if they would have come up on the water and a drank the water they would have gave God praise but it was nothing like this he didn't want them just to see the water he wanted them to see just how great he is do you trust God this morning to deliver you to carry you through the Israelites didn't see the water they could drink they didn't see that but God did God saw the sweet in the bitterness you say how because he provided it in a desert Place God shows his greatest power Luke 9:12 says when they begin to wear away they came 12 and said unto him send the multitude away that they may go into the towns and the countries and round about and lodge and get fiddles for we are in a desert place that means a Wilderness desert desolate solitary lonely desolate uninhabited you see the Jesus Took the disciples out into the desert to get some rest but word got out where they were going to be and when they got there there was a multitude of people waiting already in the desert waiting on them and the Bible said that there was 5,000 not counting men not counting women and children and after a long day of services it was getting evening time and the disciples come to the master and said Lord send these people away we have nothing to feed them with we're out here in a desert place we have nothing send them into the town that they can find loding that they can find food and Jesus said go among them and find something to feed them with and so they go Go Out Among the people and what do they find they find a little boy and they come up the little boy and he's holding this bag in his hand and if I remember I think the prophet said something like he slipped out of school and went over the mountain saw the meat and went down there to see what was going on he was curious anyhow he was at the meeting and he had this bag and it come up to the little fella said hey buddy what you got in that bag he said it's my lunch your lunch yes sir five biscuits two fish just enough for a little boy well what are you going to do with it eat it I said well would you be willing to give that lunch to Jesus what's Jesus want with my lunch he's going to feed this multitude Jesus is going to feed this multitude with my lunch you see as long as he held it in his hand it was just a little boy's lunch right but when he gave it to Jesus Look what Jesus was able to do with it as long as you hold that problem in your hand it's your problem as long as you hold that fear in your hand it's your fear but if you can give that back to Jesus just see what he's able to do with it give that diabetes to him give that back trouble to him give that glyos come on give that sorrow to [Applause] him he wants to feed this multitude with my lunch you see brother and sister God don't need something big he just needs something yielded and little as much of God is in it so Jesus took it and he blessed it and he fed 5,000 you see in that desert place I'm coming to a close they were fixing to see just how great their God was for in that desert place come A great miracle they were tired they were weary they were hungry and he fed them the children of Israel were tired and weary and thirsty and he gave them Sweet Water you may be in your your desert place this morning you may have arrived in the land of bitter water but maybe you're there maybe you're there right now for your greatest Miracle you see in that desert place in your land of Mora why don't you do like Moses and cry out to God Amen and let God show you a tree that's always been here on that's you say what tree is that it's calvary's tree you see calvary's tree holds the answer to every problem Calvary is where he paid the price to have the ability to turn your bitter Waters to Sweet Sweet Water in a bitter land David said in Psalms 138:7 though I walk in the midst of trouble thou wil revive me Thou shalt stretch forth thine hand against the wrath of my enemies and thy right hand shall save me though I walk in the midst of my troubles thou will revive me that R revived means to live to have life to remain alive to sustain to Quicken am to be quickened to be restored to be revived from sickness from discouragement from faintness from death notice David did say if I walk in the midst of trouble he said though I walk in the midst of my trouble David had an understanding that there will be trouble but in the midst of all of our trouble he said he will revive me in the times of my troubles in the land of bitter Waters he shall make my water sweet when my mama was dying of cancer she said something I'll never forget she said darl I may have cancer but cancer does not have me brother man I may have all kinds of troubles I may have troubles that you don't even know about that I've not even shared with you but in all my troubles in all my pain it does not have me it does not have you he promised he promised he would revive us the prophet said I think of a lot of times today the reason we get into typ places listen as we close we get into typ places is God wants to reveal and to show us his love and to prove to us that he's the same God yesterday today and forever and his power is still the same certainly he wants to show us his power he likes to manifest his power maybe that's why you got sick maybe that's why you got sick he wants to show you his love a Wonder working God I don't care what kind of problem you have today don't you sit here and tell me that my God can't do something about it don't you tell me he can't do it I've seen cancers disappear I have seen cancers disappear Cottonwood Arizona there's a sister sitting in the church had a tumor on her on her breast and sitting there and just praising God we just shared some things that we'd seen the Lord do took a little thought on the witness of his majesty she never came up for prayer she never even asked for prayer she was just sitting in her seat and just praising and God she said she went home took her blouse off to put ointment on this tumor that was on her chest and it was gone it disappeared during the service I was sharing with brother Matt last night I was in Kentucky preaching there's a woman sitting right back there and while I was preaching she jumped up begin to praise God and I thought man she got a blessing and she sat down and in a few minutes she got up and left and I thought I was preaching and these thoughts was going through my mind I thought why would you leave after you got such a blessing well in a few minutes she came back I what in the world when when service was over she said can I testify I turned to the pastor he said sure she said I got a tumor on my breast I'm not even told John my husband and she said while the word was going forth she said it just so inspired me I just jumped up and started thanking God for healing me and she said I got out got up and went to the bathroom and checked myself she said the tumor's gone don't you tell me he can't do it cancers can disappear cancers can disappear brother James Tidwell was at byc a few years ago he had a
