prent sends his greetings and and uh we certainly love everyone here amen amen just um turning the scriptures to St John 8 and 12 are you happy to be here tonight amen just a little little thought that we've had of of worship under Redemption and and hopefully I can get myself out of the way here tonight we just believe the Lord will will move in on your behalf amen amen just a just a sub subtext there subtitled rejecting and overcoming the LIE of the devil John 8 then spake Jesus again unto them saying I am the light of the world and he that followeth me shall not walk in darkness but shall have the light of life and the Pharisees therefore said unto him thou bearest record of thyself and thy record is not true true so they're basically calling Jesus a liar and Jesus answered and said unto them though I bear record of myself yet my record is true for I know whence I came and whether I go but ye cannot tell whence I come and whether I go ye judge after the flesh I judge no man and yet if I judge my judgment is true for I am not alone but I am the father that sent me and it is also written in your law that the testimony of two men is true and we see Jesus here even as a young child growing up you no doubt there were Whispers of of of of his birth and and the illegitimacy of it and as a young child he had to deal with those things as a teenager growing up he had to deal with those things and even Amen in his ministry here he also had to deal with these with these things and brother randam says here in 1951 he he said all that live Godly in Christ Jesus will suffer persecution he said the devil's always been after the Church of the Living God is that right and it's always had a black name Jesus was born in this world with a black name as a IL illegitimate child did you know that supposed to be born a child out of holy wedlock Jesus had that hanging on him but in his heart he knew he was the son of God and that's what it comes down to amen amen the lies of the devil you've got to come down you've got to know who you are because those attacks of the enemy are going to come he's going to try amen to Del legitimize if I get that word out try not to say that one again amen our Jesus he's going to try to try to try to throw a black name on what we believe amen but to you and I there's life in this no matter what the internet says no matter amen what somebody tries to figure out on their own understanding amen amen in this message message for you and I it is life because it is Jesus Christ and he goes on he says and men and women you know where you stand tonight and there's only one person knows he said that's God knows where you stand so it's between you and God it's not the voices of the outside world it's not the voices that try to come in it's not the Demons of Doubt right amen it's between you and God God knows where you stand and you know where you stand tonight he says so if you're Hearts right with God really live for him be true to him love him so much that everything else becomes secondarily and then you'll love the Lord God with all your heart with all your strength with all your soul with all your might amen you love the Lord tonight just before this the scriptures that we that we read just before that in the Bible there they had brought a woman caught in the very Act of adultery saying m Master the law of Moses commands us that she should be Stone stoned what sayest thou see they were always trying to get Jesus to trip up and under a religious spirit they did this to tempt Jesus that they might have accusation against him but he stooped down and rode in the sand as though he heard them not and they continued to ask him and he stood upon his feet and he said he that is without sin cast the first stone in her he was the only one that could say something like that and them being convicted in their conscience begin to leave one by one starting with the eldest and then Jesus asked her he said woman where are your accusers where is he that condemns he see they had brought her under the law of Moses amen but this man was the law of Moses amen they under the the law of Moses was condemnation under that amen you were never able to be delivered from your sin but here was a man in him was forgiveness in him was life amen the power to change a person from a life of sin Amen to make a sinner into a saint amen from a saint to a Son of God her a daughter of God Amen Satan Satan has a plot we look at this woman here maybe maybe her parents didn't do her right maybe they did do her right right but Satan has a plot and his plot is to destroy your life his purpose is to steal kill and destroy to try to take your life and get it all messed up and that's why as as young people amen the sooner that you can come to God amen amen you don't have to deal with getting messed up out in the world you don't have to deal with the scars and the things and and the and the memories and the things that Satan will try to throw at you amen serve God now amen amen dedicate your life to him amen get you dedicate all that you are to him now amen let him have preeminence in your life amen surrender to him now amen we all can testify of that I wish I'd have started serving God sooner right the sooner the better amen and and as a church amen let's let's keep an atmosphere amen that our young people can come and they can feel the presence of the Lord they don't have to go off searching for it they don't have to go this way and that way and mean they can come to the house of God Amen there's life in the body amen that's what this place is meant for amen a place where somebody can come and be changed amen amen so so Satan has a plot but God has a plan amen and that is the plan of redemption in him amen was the power of redemption in this man amen was the ability to pay the price of redemption Amen to bring us back to what we were in the mind of God Amen to be a Sons and Daughters brother brother said if you missed being a son or daughter you missed it amen that that's why he redeemed you that's why he paid the price to bring us back to bring you back to an identification to give you the power and the authority amen that Adam and Eve fell from and that's what Redemption that's what the blood has brought us back to under Redemption everything that they lost everything that they forfeited amen the word has come in this hour amen and has restored us back to that position Amen to be his sons and daughters amen that word Redemption a releasing affected by payment of Ransom it's your deliverance it's your Liberation amen it was and it was procured it was paid for it was bought by the blood of Jesus Christ and there's stages to Redemption amen it took Calvary it took a death amen and we needed that redeeming blood amen we needed that that blood to be spiled upon the ground Amen to release that life that overcoming life that was in the blood there had to be a resurrection amen that he he was raised for our justification amen we needed an intercessor Before the Throne Amen to to there intercede on the behalf of our needs of our our situ situations of our Our Lives amen we needed the Holy Ghost the quickening power the life amen of God to come back and change us amen not just to become a Rel religious people that's not why we're here amen is to be a church people amen but I want to be changed by the word I don't want to be what I was I don't I don't want to just be satisfied by what I was and how I was yesterday but there's got to be a change take place amen there's got to be something that takes place on the inside that changes your makeup changes your nature amen and that's what the Holy Ghost does amen amen it comes back upon you the life of Jesus Christ back upon the believer amen and gives you that nature of God Amen to redeem you from a life of sin to a life of service amen amen you can sit here and you you can be a Christian I can claim to be a Christian you know but we've been called to a life of service service and if you're not doing what God's called you to do you might as well be backslid and you're never going to be happy otherwise amen God saved you for a purpose he saved you for a reason amen he wanted your life he wanted your example amen he wanted a light to shine in this hour amen don't just sit around idle don't just sit by complacent amen don't let the formal amen formality of the spirit of this age creep into your life amen be a witness for Jesus Christ don't be ashamed of the Gospel don't be ashamed of what changed you amen of what changed your heart and changed your life amen amen don't be ashamed amen serve him live for him amen we needed the Holy Ghost amen we we needed the word to come in this hour we needed a prophet in this hour amen uh someone that God could could send his his thoughts to amen reveal the word to open the word to you and I amen and not just part of the word in this hour but the fullness of the word amen and and the fullness of the word will bring you to the fullness of redemption because it's not just the change on the inside but the change on the inside must manifest on the outside and there had to be a word coming this hour Amen to bring us to that type of Faith amen not just a a faith to be justified or Sanctified or or filled with the Holy Ghost but a faith to Rapture us out of here amen we had to have something different amen than what man produced in this hour amen we had to have the mind of God the intelligence the fullness of the word in the fullness of the word there's fullness of atonement amen we're not just here believing part of it but we got all of it tonight we got every bit of it you just got to take the book you got to feed on it yourself I can't give it to you you've got to take it yourself right you've got to consume it yourself so the fullness of the Redemption to finish up Redemption to change our bodies and every seed of God will come under this Redemption and brother R said only the predestinated are considered in Redemption amen it's a sovereignty of God Amen it's a predestination of God that you're considered in Redemption amen nobody amen you can try to make yourself that you can try to make yourself this amen but only the predestinated are considered in that you're predestinated before the foundation of the world but Satan has always always wanted to destroy the seat of God Amen but God has sent his fullness in this hour the fullness of the word to redeem us from the hand of the enemy do you believe that amen something to change us that's amen Redeemer Redemption brother Bram says what did he redeem he redeemed your soul from hell he redeemed and brought back everything that Adam lost when he put you in the pawn shop so Adam lost it and Adam put you in the pawn shop brother Ram said the devil didn't do it you're in the devil's pawn shop but Adam sold you out sold me out and put us in that pawn shop but Jesus Christ comes Amen to redeem us back out of that pawn shop Amen to redeem us back amen from everything that Adam lost and he goes on Jesus Christ on Calvary was your kinsman redeemer that redeemed you from Every curse of the devil he redeemed your soul he redeems your sick body he redeems your weary and dreary spirit amen he brought you happiness he brought you Joy amen amen that's what Redemption brought you it brought you peace longsuffering gentleness meekness power the Holy Spirit it brought you Divine Healing all these things Jesus Christ brought to you amen he had to pay the price CHR amen that we could be redeemed back you think of Every curse it redeemed you from Every curse Lord every generational curse everything that's been passed down from generation to generation you and I Amen in this last and final Generation all that has been bottled up in you and I and we've got to deal with these things and if you if you don't deal with it and me you're just going to keep passing it on and passing it on but there's going to be a people that recognize that reject the LIE the devil that says I just had to be this way my family was this way I'm always going to be this way but there's going to be a people that change amen let's say enough is enough amen you love the Lord tonight Galatians 3 and13 praise the Lord Galatians 3 and13 Lord help my voice tonight Christ hath redeemed us from the curse of the law being made a a curse for us for it is written cursed is everyone that hangeth on a tree so he hath redeemed us and that that word there redeemed and I like how you studying in in the in the message and that uh looking at the different meanings you can you know sometimes redeemed means this and it it means that depending on what word you click on but here it means the by payment of price to recover from the power of another amen the payment and the price that he paid am mean you were under the influence of another you were under the power of another but this price that he paid amen was to recover you amen from the power of another from the grip and from the hole from somebody else amen from under the law the law showed me my sin the law put me in prison but Grace got me out amen and he became sin who knew no sin that we might become his righteousness oh my think of that how low he had to go amen he took upon him the Seed of Abraham he came in flesh amen he came as a man he didn't come as an angel amen but he come and he and he had to live he had to endure amen the the heartaches and and and and different accusations and and the black marks and different things he overcame for you and I he conquered as a man for you and I amen that that and he became [Applause] us the worst thing we could have ever done all of us put together he took that on himself he became so forsaken that he screamed out my God my God why has Thou forsaken me he was so forsaken the scripture says cursed is he that hangs on a tree he took our place that we could take his he became me that I could become him amen don't live defeated tonight don't live bound tonight don't live in that way don't stay in that condition Jesus didn't come and overcome and and go to hell amen and Rise he didn't do all that for no reason amen there so that you could just be bound but he did it so you could be free so amen amen Adam and Eve sold you out to the devil when they believed the LIE of the devil and that's why there's got to be a people that reject the LIE of the devil what did they do they they broke the law of God they broke the law of what God said not to do amen he told Eve he said you you eat this and your eyes will be open you shall be as Gods knowing good and evil and see Satan is a designer he's a perverter because he can't create and by his lies his Mis misrepresentations of what God said he projects his thoughts for your life because he's a designer he can't create so he has to project and try to pervert what God has already created right right so and we see from that accepted lie in the Garden of Eden Satan has designed his own Eden and has become the god of this evil age he's had 6,000 years Amen to design he's had 6,000 years to study human nature to study you and I why because there's one there's going to be one final battle God help me to preach tonight there's going to be one final battle amen with the bride of this age and that devil that Satan that serpent that accuser amen anden there's going going to be a time amen where he's where we go up and he's cast down amen one day the battle amen while it's raging now one day the battle will be over amen but don't let down your guard amen amen because he's like a roaring lion seeking roaming about seeking whom he may devire and don't think he ain't trying to destroy the seed of God here tonight amen but I want to say tonight that you're predestinated you're predestinated in this hour to stand amen as that Eve she sold you out she gave you up amen this Eve is predestinated to stand in this hour take what a prophet of God said about you let it anoint your faith amen take what a prophet of God said about a bride in this hour amen and you will overcome amen amen Romans 12 and 1 I beseech you therefore Brethren by the mercies of God that you present so your service is your worship your worship to God that's your service amen and to conform that word means to conform oneself to another's pattern to somebody else's fashion to somebody else's design and that's what Satan wants by the things of the World by the things of this life amen he wants your focus he wants your attention uh Facebook social media we're on it too much but it's projecting to you amen Satan's design whether we realize it or not and you've got to reject that you've got to not be conformed Amen to this world you've got to reject this world reject what it's got to offer and I say this if something's took place in you amen you won't have a desire for the world Amen we've got to live we've got to breathe we've got to function and we've got to go out and rub shoulders amen but there's something about a child of God a son or daughter of God they act different amen they know where they came from and they know where they're going they know they're a child of the king amen you've got to be different we've got to be different than this world you've got to be set apart amen I don't want to conform but I want to be transformed amen and you look in the in the demon Realms and the things that are going on back uh in pigot where I'm at there's this lady she's worked there at this grocery store for years and she's a woman but now she looks like a man But as time went on whatever they pump in their system she became more and more like a man got a full beard but that's the perversion of what we've gotten to it's the saddest thing it's the saddest thing but in in the in the Demonic Realms you see what Satan he's trying to copy what God is doing among his people amen he's changing us from glory to glory amen we may not all change all at once amen but there's stages there's things amen there there's amen there's Revelations that come and what we'll do is if if you'll just sit sit quiet and sit still the father will reveal his word to you amen but we let we let jobs we let we let this we let our wife we brother say you let the pastor you let this one and you let this this one take it out of you but it's a father if you'll sit quiet if you'll sit still he's trying to reveal himself to you he's trying to change you from glory to glory amen amen to make you different from what you were but under perversion we see what Satan's trying to do you see some of these people they I've just seen where you probably seen it too where you you know these transgenders they'll change and then they'll want to go back and then they'll want to go back again what is it their minds are all messed up they're living under the deception and the delusion of the devil but there's a word here to change you I can't change you but he can I can't change you but I know a man who can amen I just read this quote and I I thought it it was good maybe we can get something out of it he says here now that's in power of transformation he says that's what I'm trying to warn you all here about when you see God's seed begin to take hold to grow watch out for that fellow coming in just as slick as he can be quote scripture just as as who couldn't have who wouldn't have it see watch him because he's a deceiver I'm not talking about nobody I just read this quote and I seen it and I thought it was good I'm going he said I'm going to call instead of a conformer being conformed he's a deformer Satan is a deformer deforming the things that's been conformed he's a deformer a perverter a corruptor of the Original Seed of the original program he said now you see here like in your group here you've got a program you've got a vision you've got a program you've got a vision now watch for that corruptor he'll be Sly Slick as he can be but keep your vision see keep holding to that amen a a prophet of God God came in this hour he showed us the difference between the church and the bride he showed us the serpent seed he showed us the man of iniquity showed us all these things and it it's it's to show you who you are show you that you're different that you're set apart that we're supposed to be different from the church and to give us a vision of what the bride is supposed to be amen pray for my voice praise the Lord in the revelation of Jesus Christ the church age book he says in this Revelation he tells us what the end of the devil is he tells us how it's going to deal with the devil and cast him into the Lake of Fire he reveals the end of the wicked ones who follow Satan and Satan hates that he said have you ever noticed Satan hates the two books of the Bible all the more than the others he's always attacking the Book of Genesis and the Book of Revel ations in both of these books we find Satan's Origins his awful ways of Destruction and that's why he attacks them he hates to be exposed in those books because he's exactly what he is and Jesus he said Jesus said about Satan he has no part in me and I have no part in him and he said the devil would like to try to come prove different but he cannot so all he does is try to destroy the confidence in the word he said I love this but when the church disbelieves Satan and believes the spirit's revelation of the word the Gates of Hell cannot Prevail against her don't you believe that tonight all hell is against this truth all hell is against this teaching there had to come a movement where they would try to destroy this word where they would try to discredit this word amen because it always had to come it always had to be that way amen but amen there's a church that's going to disbelieve Satan and she's going to believe the spirit's revelation of the world that's not will bram's Revelation that's the spirit of God the light of God the power of God that was s in this hour amen amen the the spirit's Revelation telling you who you are telling you the conditions of the age amen warning you of the formal spirit that would creep in the blindness of this age and it ask you to purchase I have that you can see anoint your eyes with the message of the hour the spirit of God speaking to you amen it's more than words of a man and how Satan God help my voice how Satan projects his thoughts and he designs God has projected his thoughts to you and I in this hour to change you and to transform you you got to reject the LIE of the devil amen I love this Christ in the true church is what a continuation of the book of Acts but the Book of Revelation shows how the Antichrist spirit will come into the church and defile it making it lukewarm formal and Powerless amen so it it exposes Satan it exposes his works and you've got to discern you've got to discern and withstand as Believers in this hour you've got to discern and withstand that Antichrist spirit and what does he come and do he tries to make he tries to quien you down he tries to bring you down amen he tries to give you an old form normal oh oh weak Spirit oh water down Spirit he'll try to come in our pull pits and I nobody here does this but he'll try to come in our pull pits and try to sugarcoat something try to water something down amen I don't want nothing watered down give it to me straight tell me about it tell me where I'm wrong amen because judgment begins at the house of God Amen if we're going to get right this is the place we're going to get right amen give it to me straight tell me just like the prophet said it amen amen the Spirit and the bride the Bible says the spirit and the bride are saying the same thing and me the spirit and the prophet and the bride are all saying the same thing that's good yes sir Satan hates Revelation because he knows if the true the people can get the true revelation of what the true church is what she stands for she can do the Greater Works she'll be an invincible Army amen amen Satan hates revelation we love it he says with true Revelation in our lives the gates of hell can't Prevail against us but we will prevail over them amen he's trying to show you not give you just a head knowledge or an intellectual faith if you'll get quiet before God he'll show you his revelation of his word I believe that amen we look at the scripture that we read Jesus are calling him a liar This Record wasn't true what he was bearing witness of wasn't true but he was bearing witness of the light amen he was the light of the world and he said he that followeth me shall not walk in darkness but shall have the light of life he said though I bear record of myself my record is true and I love this when our scripture that we read he said I know from when I came and whether I go amen Jesus knew where he came from he knew from what he came from he knew is how he knew is why he knew his purpose amen Jesus knew who he was and he knew where he came from amen and he knew where he was going Jesus wasn't confused but he knew what he believed and that's what it takes for the bride in this hour Satan will try to get you to doubt he'll try to get you doubt who you are amen amen that's when you've got to be just as sure as Jesus was it's got to be just as real to you amen and when the Revelation comes amen there's power in that Revelation amen there's power to bind the enemy amen when you know who you are amen amen sat can't put nothing on you you know who you are you you have an identification and I'm a son that I'm a daughter of God amen amen and Satan is under your feet you have authority tonight as Sons and Daughters of God but you've got to know whom you have beli you got to know what's right you got to know what the scripture says about you your life has to be identified in that word amen you know where you came from and you know where you're going amen love the Lord tonight amen I got about 12 more pages goodness try to hurry up here so they' ask Jesus who is your father where is your father and he dealt with this his entire life brother Brenham says here he says look at Jesus away with that guy we know he's a Samaritan he's crazy will you teach us you were born in adultery you wasn't nothing but an illegitimate child to come from who's your daddy say God's your father you blasphemer why you mean to tell us but Jesus said in St John 8 he said why do you not understand understand my speech even because you cannot hear my word and he said ye are of your father the devil and the lust of your father will you do he was a murderer from the beginning and a bold nod in the truth because there is no truth in him when he speaketh a lie speaketh of his own for he is a liar and the father of it so Jesus was speaking to these Pharisees here these were these were clean men these were men that you couldn't put a finger on their lives their lives were without blemish but brother around said why because they couldn't see the message they couldn't see the word he was right there in front of him but they rejected him and the seed of the serpent will always reject the word and God will give them an opportunity he'll give them away if you'll do right amen amen won't you be accepted but it's not in them to do right because that seed of that serpent will always reject the word amen because they are are ordained to that condemnation sir second Thessalonians 2:10 with all deceivableness of unrighteousness in them that perish because they receive not the love of the truth that they might be saved and for this cause God shall send them strong delusion that they should be believe a lie and that they all might be damned by who believed not the truth but had unle pleasure in righteousness oh my brother random says here God's WRA gift he said God give them over the strong delusion to believe a lie and be damned by God said it would do it you refuse right you have to take wrong there's no other way you refuse to go right you have to go left go other some way besides right you can't go right and wrong at the same time when they refuse the Holy Ghost they refuse Christ they refuse God's program they refuse the messenger they refuse everything so therefore they're they're left in their sins and there's nothing left them but judgment so they're under this delusion amen they're ordained to condemnation they're ordained to judgment and I say this if there are damned who believe not the truth what about those amen that have been ordained to believe it amen there's got to be a blessing to those amen that believe it there's got to be a blessing if it's damnation if it's a cursed cursed way if it's held to disbelieve it to reject it am mean there's got to be a blessing tonight there's got to be a blessing in this hour Amen to those that believe it oh my I believe the blessing in this hour amen it's Freedom it's liberty it's Sons and Daughters of God it's a full word of God in this hour Amen to conquer your enemy amen it's the fullness of of everything that God had

people's got the victory amen because they continue in my word they've been ordained to walk with me amen don't walk with me he told the prophet one time he said walk with me walk with me Amen brother brandom had seen all kinds of things all kinds of experiences but there was another experience there amen where God comes down calms the storm amen the deers was there wish I could recall the story

of the Earth God gave it to you and I right you have it you possess it it's in your hands amen the most Vindicated word you got to take the book you've got to eat it amen you love the Lord tonight he goes on here he says people won't believe churches won't believe he said you can't be disappointed it because the Bible said they would do it but it's in it's you individuals that's ordained to life look upon the fields now and see the hour that we're living come to life life let the life that was in Christ come in you amen the mind you said oh I think this I think this he says you ain't got no thought coming he said you let the thoughts that was in Christ be in you and that's the word that's right think the thoughts that he had amen there's got to be a people that receive the mind of God that lean not un their own understanding amen their own ability God give me knowledge give me understanding give me what I have need of to be able to make it to be able to function in this life I can't do it on my own and mean there's too many demon Spirits in this hour amen we can't make it on our own we need him in this hour you can't think this and think that we got to take it just like it was given we got to receive it just like it was given amen sir amen and that's what's going to bring us through that's what's going to bring us to a Rapture to a body change it's not our own our own ability amen but there's got to be a man that can turn on the light amen you might be walking amen it might be dark out but there's a man that can turn on the light you may not know what to do which way to turn which way to go amen but if you'll be steady if you'll be patient if you'll fear not there's a man that can turn on the light amen we can't Rapture ourselves out of here I can't change my body I couldn't deliver myself from sin amen but there was a predestined predestinated moment there's a predestinated Time amen when the man turned on the light amen something changed and when God decides for there to be a Rapture amen he'll pull the trigger amen we just got to be ready we got to be waiting amen you love the Lord tonight he says here again you ain't got no thought coming that's right say I think this you haven't got a thought I haven't either Bible said let the mind that was in Christ be in you and he was always about the father's business so that's the only thought that you ought to have what God said about it not what somebody else said about you got to reject those thoughts CU amen those thoughts are going to come what somebody else said about it but it's between you and God Amen but what God says that's all there is to he said let every man's be a word be a lie and mine be the truth there's reality and the truth amen everything else going on it's going to fade

battle ever Fs in your mind right God chose the heart and the devil chose the Mind Right amen don't give no place to the devil don't let him have no place oh my I got so much here let's just skip on down a little bit Jesus knew who he was it didn't matter what what what anybody said he knew who he was he knew his position and he had faith in who he was he knew what his purpose was was and he was there to do not of his own pleasure but to do the will of the father and brother Bram says here in perfect Faith he says now the only thing you have to do then is have faith in what you are have faith in what the word says you are he said and Jesus had faith in the word he said he said that he was I am the bread of life that come from God out of Heaven I am the tree of life that was from the Garden of Eden I am all these things I am that I am he said and he knew with that perfect faith that he was the anointed Messiah amen that the spirit of God was upon him he said now in myself I do nothing but it's my faith in God and God was in him and the Word was made manifest and he says this he said then when the word of God comes in you it's made manifest if you're a Believer and a Believer is amen it's the faith of God that moves in you so you got to understand your position in the scripture you got to understand where you came from and where you're going think about it Resurrection time and going to the Cross Jesus brother BR says here in the perfect Faith he says you destroy this body and I'll raise it up cuz he knowed he was the Messiah he said I the scripture says I'll not suffer my Holy One to see corruption he knowed he was the Holy One he knew that's what he was and neither will I leave his soul in hell he didn't and he knowed he had he he do it and he had confidence that that he was there to conquer both death and hell he said you destroy it if you wish you but I'll raise it back in 3 days he said oh my I have power to lay my life down and I have power to take it up again amen nobody ever said nothing like that amen amen nobody ever ever declared those words amen but there was one that knew who he was and he said you're a Christian you have right any Redemptive blessing that Jesus died for for you it's all yours it's already paid for and you just have to believe it amen not imagine it but believe it and know that it's yours and you can possess it oh that's conquering Faith yeah amen you got to know without a shadow of doubt you got to walk right on he says if the Lord says this there's nobody in the world that can talk you out of it you go right on just the same you've got to believe no matter what and go right on Amen he says now you're coming to perfect Faith perfect Perfection that cannot fail that faith never fails I'm going to keep reading this because it's so good all right it's the message he says we're taught to resist the devil and he'll flee from us now to resist is just to Simply turn him down that's just too simple isn't it that's too easy but just turn him down just resist him just walk away from it God said a certain thing no matter what he's trying to tell you you don't even listen to him your ears are deaf to anything else but what the spirit says and he goes on to he that has an ear amen that listens to he that has an ear that listens see what the spirit sath under the churches that's the one that's got the listening post amen that catches what the spirit says to the churches you turn a deaf ear to it oh I love that let's turn a DEA here let's let him Ramble On Let's Walk Away turn a death fear to it listen to what the word says about you oh my 2 Corinthians 10:3 I'll try to hurry here for though we walk in the flesh we do not war after the flesh for the weapons of our Warfare are not carnal But Mighty through God
