[41:25] Amen. We just appreciate those songs.
[41:28] Enjoy the specials tonight. And I just
[41:31] want to get right into the word of God.
[41:33] And Lord, put this on my heart. but it's
[41:35] been burning on my heart all day. So,
[41:37] just want toh just to get out of the way
[41:39] and let the Lord come. And how many
[41:41] wants to see that tonight? Amen. Just
[41:43] allow the Lord to come and speak to his
[41:45] church. We want to read out of the book
[41:46] of Matthew, the first chapter. Uh we're
[41:49] going to have three uh readings. Uh the
[41:52] first chapter of Matthew, then we'll
[41:53] read out of the book of John the 4th
[41:55] chapter and then John the 20th chapter.
[41:58] So, um we'll start in Matthew the 1st
[42:01] chapter and the 19th verse. Matter of
[42:03] fact, I'll just back up to the 18th
[42:05] verse, one verse. And of course, this
[42:08] portion of scripture is speaking uh of
[42:11] after that Mary was found uh with child.
[42:14] The Bible says, "Now the birth of Jesus
[42:16] was on this wise when his mother Mary
[42:18] was a spouse to Joseph." In other words,
[42:20] that she was engaged to be married.
[42:22] Before they came together, she was found
[42:25] with the child of the Holy Ghost. And
[42:27] then Joseph her husband being a just man
[42:29] and not willing to make a public example
[42:32] was minded to put her away privately.
[42:34] But while he thought on these things,
[42:36] behold, the angel of the Lord appeared
[42:38] unto him in a dream, saying, Joseph,
[42:41] thou son of David, fear not to take unto
[42:43] thee Mary, thy wife, for that which is
[42:46] conceived in her is of the Holy Ghost,
[42:49] and she shall bring forth a son, and
[42:51] thou shalt call his name Jesus, for he
[42:54] shall save his people from their sins.
[42:57] And I also want to read out of John 4,
[42:59] and we'll read from the 25th verse. So
[43:03] John the 4th chapter in the 25th verse.
[43:06] This is the story of the woman at the
[43:07] well after Jesus began to speak to her
[43:10] and discerning her life and things that
[43:13] was going on in her life. Uh notice how
[43:15] that she responds. She says, "The woman
[43:18] saith unto him, I know that the Messiah
[43:20] cometh, which is called Christ, and when
[43:22] he comes, he will tell us of all things.
[43:25] And Jesus said unto her, I that speak
[43:28] unto thee am he."
[43:30] &gt;&gt; Amen. Now in John the 20th chapter and
[43:34] we'll read out the 24th verse. Now this
[43:37] is uh Thomas remember Thomas that
[43:40] doubted who Jesus was uh after the
[43:43] crucifixion. And so here when Jesus
[43:46] would come to the disciples Thomas
[43:48] couldn't believe uh that he would
[43:50] actually be able to be there. So the
[43:52] Bible says but Thomas one of the 12
[43:54] called Ditimus was not with them when
[43:56] Jesus came. And the other disciples
[43:57] therefore said to him, "We have seen the
[43:59] Lord." But he said unto them, "Except I
[44:02] shall see in the in his hands the print
[44:04] of the nails, and put my finger into the
[44:06] print of the nails, and thrust my hand
[44:07] into his side, I will not believe." But
[44:10] after 8 days again his disciples were
[44:12] within, and Thomas with them, they came
[44:14] Jesus, the doors being shut, and stood
[44:17] in the midst, and said, "Peace be unto
[44:19] you." Then he said to Thomas, notice
[44:21] they didn't tell Jesus everything that
[44:23] was uh that Thomas was battling with,
[44:25] but Jesus certainly discerned it. And he
[44:27] said to Thomas, "Reach hither thy finger
[44:30] and behold my hands, and reach hither
[44:32] thy hand, and thrust it into my side,
[44:35] and be not faithless, but believing."
[44:37] And Thomas answered and said unto him,
[44:40] "My Lord and my God."
[44:42] So I want to speak tonight using uh this
[44:45] scripture as a foundation but I want to
[44:47] speak on feasting on the revelation. As
[44:49] you take your seats feasting on the
[44:51] revelation. Now here these three
[44:53] scriptures you know they they seem to be
[44:56] three uh a completely different stories
[44:58] but I just read them uh showing that
[45:01] these scriptures were all doing the same
[45:03] thing. It was Christ being revealed. So
[45:05] all three scrip scriptures was uh the
[45:08] revelation of Christ. One is he was
[45:10] being revealed before his birth. one was
[45:12] revealed just before his death and the
[45:14] last it was him being revealed after his
[45:16] resurrection. So all three times we see
[45:19] that uh that that it was Christ being
[45:21] revealed. So uh we realize that one
[45:23] being before his birth, one before his
[45:26] death, one after his resurrection. In
[45:27] other words, that uh you realize that
[45:30] all of time that is recorded is about is
[45:33] in one of these three dispensations. all
[45:36] of time, everything in history, all of
[45:37] time, uh, anything that we ever read
[45:39] about happened in one of these three
[45:41] dispensations. It was either before
[45:42] Christ was born, while Christ was on the
[45:45] earth, or after his crucifixion. So, uh,
[45:48] it it it covers everything and all of
[45:51] time. So, we realize that each one of
[45:53] them was all three different
[45:54] dispensations of time, but in every
[45:56] dispensation, there was one thing in
[45:58] common. It was that Christ was revealed.
[46:01] So, it didn't matter where, what portion
[46:03] of time that you come in. uh this is the
[46:05] one thing that's always in common that
[46:07] Christ has always been revealed and uh
[46:09] you know last Sunday as I was speaking
[46:11] on the life of Abraham and it kind of
[46:13] got into that the Lord had just led me
[46:16] uh into this thought and and uh and we
[46:18] were uh going through the life of
[46:19] Abraham and and how that God had called
[46:22] him to sojourn into uh into this uh uh
[46:25] land and and to go and and make his walk
[46:27] with God. And uh we realize that Abraham
[46:30] in his life uh that that Abraham wasn't
[46:33] a man that was born to wealth. He wasn't
[46:35] a man that was great wealth. It was
[46:37] matter of fact, if you looked at
[46:38] Abraham's life, maybe you would look and
[46:40] say uh that God seemed like he blessed
[46:42] everybody else except for Abraham. He
[46:44] wasn't uh he was not a man of great
[46:46] wealth. He wasn't a man of great
[46:48] stature. But uh you can't ever find
[46:50] anything in the history of Abraham where
[46:52] he was a complainer or complained about
[46:54] his situation. But you know uh when you
[46:57] look through history you also can't find
[46:59] anything recorded of anything meaningful
[47:01] that ever happened in his life. There
[47:03] was no uh nothing to be written about.
[47:05] It would seem like he had an uneventful
[47:06] life. It seemed like that there was
[47:08] nothing great ever happened. There was
[47:10] nothing great ever recorded. There
[47:11] wasn't uh nothing that was worth writing
[47:13] about. You know, you can look at
[47:14] Abraham's story and you kind of you kind
[47:16] of feel like Abraham sometimes. There
[47:18] wasn't a lot of things that went on or a
[47:20] lot of great accomplishments that
[47:21] Abraham made before God called him. uh
[47:23] there really was nothing that ever
[47:25] happened. No fame, no wealth. And uh
[47:27] maybe even Abraham was a man that most
[47:29] people wouldn't even known who he was.
[47:30] He wasn't uh he wasn't some great
[47:32] popular man or something like that. And
[47:34] you know, I thought about Abraham in
[47:36] that way. And I thought, you know, maybe
[47:38] the the the world may have not have knew
[47:40] who he was. And the people in the land
[47:42] of may not knew nothing about him. They
[47:44] may not know who he was. But uh the one
[47:46] thing that mattered most is that God
[47:48] knew who Abraham was. And I thought you
[47:50] that's the way it is. You may not mean
[47:52] nothing to the world and you may not
[47:53] there may not nobody know you but as
[47:55] long as God knows you that's what really
[47:57] matters and and God knew Abraham and you
[48:00] know you uh many times when you look at
[48:02] the life of Abraham maybe you say well
[48:03] Abraham was called of God because he was
[48:06] a great man maybe Abraham was a great
[48:08] man of war but that really wasn't the
[48:09] case maybe he was a man that had a great
[48:12] gift but actually that wasn't the case
[48:14] at all and uh you know I thought about
[48:16] even uh even uh whoever it is in the
[48:19] Bible that anytime uh that We think of
[48:21] great men or great women in the
[48:23] scriptures and uh most of the time we
[48:25] have to put these people in a
[48:27] classification that they're almost
[48:29] superhuman in order to even talk about
[48:31] them or to read about them. You ever
[48:32] done that when you read about Bible
[48:34] characters? They're they got to be some
[48:36] super men or super women or superhuman
[48:39] or or or they have some super gifts
[48:41] because after all God used them. So
[48:43] there must be something really
[48:44] spectacular about their life for God to
[48:47] be able to use them. And that's the way
[48:48] that we perceive the uh the people in
[48:50] the Bible that we read about. And you
[48:52] know, I think a lot of times I think
[48:54] it's the devil that puts that in our
[48:55] mind. I I think Satan does that to
[48:57] separate you from them kind of people. I
[48:59] I think he does it so that when you read
[49:01] about these people in the Bible that you
[49:03] can say, "Well, I'm not like them after
[49:05] all. You know, I could see God using
[49:07] somebody like Abraham, but you know, I'm
[49:09] really not a man like Abraham was. And
[49:11] you know, I don't have the strength that
[49:13] Samson had. So, you know, I I certainly
[49:15] couldn't live like that. Or I don't have
[49:16] the faith of that Sarapheneician woman
[49:18] that that would crawl through the crowd
[49:20] and claw away to God. Or or I don't have
[49:22] the courage like David had to go down
[49:24] and and stand in front of a giant. Or
[49:26] the courage like Ruth had that would
[49:28] that would walk away from all that she
[49:29] knew in the land of Moab to follow her
[49:31] mother-in-law into a place that she had
[49:34] never been. Or maybe uh you think of the
[49:36] Hebrew children say, "Well, I don't have
[49:37] the resolve that they have that they
[49:39] would be able to walk into a fiery
[49:41] furnace and not be able to bow down to a
[49:44] uh to an image and be able to have the
[49:46] resolve just to stand on the things of
[49:47] God." And you know, they had these
[49:49] special gifts and these special talents
[49:51] and these special powers in their life
[49:54] that allow God to be able to use them.
[49:56] And I think that God that Satan does
[49:58] that to make you feel like that they're
[50:00] such a super class of people and then
[50:02] suddenly you begin to feel like a
[50:04] nobody. And and now that you're not a
[50:06] super class like they are, therefore God
[50:09] can't use you like God used them. So God
[50:12] couldn't take you into the valley of Eli
[50:14] like he did David. He couldn't take you
[50:16] into Bethlehem like he did Ruth. And he
[50:18] couldn't take you through a fiery
[50:19] furnace like he did the Hebrew children
[50:21] because after all, you're not a super
[50:23] class like they are. You know, so when
[50:25] you think about Abraham, the life of
[50:28] Abraham here, uh Abraham was the father
[50:30] of faith. The Bible would say he was the
[50:32] father. He was the father of our faith.
[50:34] You realize that the actually actually
[50:36] Abraham was the foundation of the entire
[50:39] Bible. One man, he was the foundation of
[50:41] everything we read. He he was the man
[50:43] that God called and out of Abraham he
[50:45] made the nation of Israel. The entire
[50:48] Old Testament Bible is written about
[50:50] Abraham, God calling Abraham. how that
[50:53] he how that this this nation came out of
[50:55] the boughs of Abraham. It was the rise
[50:57] and the falls of the nation that all
[50:59] came from father Abraham. But then when
[51:01] you turn over the New Testament, it's
[51:03] the faith seed of Abraham and how that
[51:05] it was prophesied that there would come
[51:07] one that would be after father Abraham.
[51:09] So everything in the Bible comes from
[51:11] that one foundation of this one great
[51:13] man by the name of Abraham. So so it's
[51:16] so easy to take and look at him and
[51:18] think my he must have been some great
[51:19] man. after all that if all the Bible's
[51:22] written about Abraham and everything
[51:23] stem from Abraham, well, he must have
[51:25] had this great religious background and
[51:27] he must have been raised in this great
[51:29] religious culture and he must have had
[51:31] all that built into his life that when
[51:33] he came to this age uh this 75 years old
[51:37] that God would be able to use him. But I
[51:39] read what the prophet said. He said, you
[51:41] know what he said? And when I think
[51:42] about Abraham back yonder, he said, I
[51:44] find that Abraham was just an ordinary
[51:48] man. He wasn't any more than any other
[51:50] man. A matter of fact, he would talk
[51:52] about his family. He said his father,
[51:54] maybe his father was an idol worshipper
[51:56] that come out of the land of Chaldia.
[51:58] You ever thought of that? He didn't come
[51:59] out of some great religious family, but
[52:01] his father was an idol worshipper that
[52:03] come out of Babylon. That you remember
[52:05] Babylon how all the people in the world
[52:07] were scattered, but under the great
[52:09] nation of Babylon, it brought all the
[52:11] people together. they created this great
[52:12] nation or this great organization, this
[52:15] great this place where people could come
[52:17] to and they worship roots of trees and
[52:19] worship uh the nature and all these
[52:21] different things that they worship you
[52:23] know that was all started uh built by
[52:25] Nimrod these great cities and idol
[52:27] worship and and all this came out of
[52:29] Babylon and this is the place where
[52:31] Abraham's family had came from it wasn't
[52:33] a a great religious background after all
[52:35] but he came out of Babylon and and as
[52:37] his father came from this place and they
[52:39] pulled away out of that group Here
[52:41] Abraham comes 75 years into his life and
[52:45] God all of a sudden appears to this man
[52:47] Abraham and says Abraham come and follow
[52:50] me. Man, if that don't speak of
[52:51] election, I don't know what does. That
[52:53] God could take a man's life that wasn't
[52:55] a religious man that didn't come from a
[52:57] great religious background, that wasn't
[52:58] built up as some super man or some super
[53:01] stature or that didn't have some super
[53:03] gift, but he was an ordinary man just
[53:05] like you and I. That God could call him
[53:07] and say, "I want you to come and walk
[53:09] with me a little while." That God could
[53:10] take an ordinary man that came out of an
[53:13] ordinary background. His father, they
[53:15] had to work for a living. He didn't care
[53:16] to get his hands dirty. He wasn't no
[53:18] special pampered person that was
[53:20] pampered up to where God could use him
[53:22] when he got to a certain age. But he was
[53:24] ordinary just like you and I. And God
[53:26] called him and said,"Abraham, won't you
[53:28] come and walk with me?"
[53:29] &gt;&gt; And then everything in Abraham's life
[53:31] begin to change. The Bible tells us of
[53:33] the story of Abraham and how that he
[53:36] spent his life on a journey with God.
[53:38] But I want you to notice this that
[53:40] before Abraham went on this journey that
[53:42] first he had to separate from his past.
[53:44] He had to he separated from some old
[53:46] teaching. He had to separate from maybe
[53:48] from some old theology and maybe uh
[53:50] maybe he had to he had to get away from
[53:52] it long enough that he could be free in
[53:55] his spirit with God that he could
[53:57] actually follow God.
[53:58] &gt;&gt; And so when Abraham would approach God,
[54:00] brother Mark, he would approach God with
[54:02] an open heart. So he took he had to take
[54:04] everything that was in his past. I'm I'm
[54:05] I'm going to get somewhere. He had to
[54:07] take everything that was in his past and
[54:09] at some point he just had to drop it and
[54:11] leave it and let it alone and let it be
[54:13] buried back there and not be able to be
[54:15] brought up and just carry on and allow
[54:17] God to be able to use him. See, it took
[54:19] a separation. Brother Ram said he
[54:20] separated himself and he went into the
[54:23] desert and he took the way with the
[54:24] Lord's despised few. He said, and that
[54:27] should be our attitude tonight is to
[54:29] take the way with God's people.
[54:30] Regardless of whether it's hard or easy,
[54:33] we ought to take the way with God's
[54:34] people anyhow and be ready to go at any
[54:36] time, wherever God might call you. See,
[54:39] God was calling Abraham to a place. Now,
[54:42] watch what Abraham, he didn't know where
[54:44] it was, but he knew one thing. In order
[54:46] to get where God was calling him, he had
[54:47] to separate from his past.
[54:49] &gt;&gt; That's what he knew. I know there was a
[54:50] lot of things he didn't know. Abraham
[54:52] didn't know what his calling was. He
[54:53] didn't know what God was going to use
[54:55] him for. He didn't know the battles that
[54:57] he was going to have to face. He didn't
[54:58] know what would happen. uh in in Sodom
[55:01] and Gomorrah, Abraham wasn't God didn't
[55:03] give him all those great things, but he
[55:05] just said, "Come and walk with me." He
[55:06] may maybe he didn't even know the
[55:08] purpose that God had for him, but he
[55:09] knew he was supposed to walk with God.
[55:11] And he he didn't know where he would
[55:13] even end up, but he started out in that
[55:15] direction. I think that's the way every
[55:16] one of us done. Whenever we were young
[55:18] Christians and God called us, I didn't
[55:20] know what God was going to do with my
[55:21] life. I didn't know where I was going to
[55:23] end up. I didn't know what God would use
[55:25] me for. But I made a commitment when God
[55:27] called me, "Lord, wherever you lead,
[55:28] I'll follow. where wherever you go, I'll
[55:30] just be found tagging along behind you
[55:32] just trying to be my best to be in the
[55:34] will of God.
[55:35] &gt;&gt; But every one of us when we start this
[55:37] walk, we we start questioning things
[55:38] that would take place in our life. Maybe
[55:40] great trials and great things,
[55:42] experiences that happen. And every one
[55:44] of us can say this same thing that many
[55:46] times we questioned. Am I doing the
[55:48] right thing? Am I in the will of God? Am
[55:50] I am I following what God told me to do?
[55:52] Am I am I at the right job? Am I doing
[55:54] everything? It just seems like, you
[55:56] know, sometimes I it seems like when I
[55:58] look around at everything, maybe I'm not
[56:00] doing anything right. And you know, you
[56:01] start to question your experience. And
[56:03] but I want you to know something about
[56:04] Abraham is he didn't know everything.
[56:06] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[56:07] &gt;&gt; Hello, somebody. He didn't know
[56:08] everything. But let me tell you what he
[56:10] did know. He did know that God called
[56:12] him. And he did know that he had to
[56:13] separate from things in order to get
[56:15] where God wanted him to be. So can I say
[56:18] this to you tonight that if you want to
[56:19] grow spiritually, here's one key for you
[56:21] that spiritual growth demands
[56:23] separation. And that was Abraham's first
[56:25] step. It it it demands that we separate
[56:27] from things. We have to cut things off.
[56:29] I I'll just say it like this. A call to
[56:32] follow God is a call to separate from
[56:34] the world. A call to follow God is a
[56:37] call to separate from idols. It's a call
[56:39] to separate from family belief. It's a
[56:41] call to separate from family tradition.
[56:43] It's a call to separate from old
[56:45] theology and man-made theology and
[56:47] worldly things. See, and then whenever
[56:50] you separate from those things, then all
[56:52] of a sudden your journey no longer
[56:54] becomes about your past and your and
[56:56] your failures of your past and all the
[56:58] things that you went through. All the
[57:00] things you've been dragging along all
[57:02] your life. And when you start that walk
[57:03] with God, brother Mark, all of a sudden
[57:05] your journey is not about those things,
[57:07] but your journey becomes about your
[57:09] relationship between you and God.
[57:12] &gt;&gt; And the past don't matter no more.
[57:14] Everything in Chalda stayed in Chaldia,
[57:16] the land of stayed in the land of the
[57:18] family problem stayed in the family. But
[57:20] when Abraham was walking in the
[57:21] wilderness, he was walking on a journey
[57:23] with God. And the only thing that
[57:25] mattered anymore was his relationship
[57:27] between him and God. The Bible said, "If
[57:30] you love the world or the things of the
[57:31] world, the love of God is not in you. We
[57:33] have to separate." Brother said, "God
[57:34] requires a complete separation from all
[57:37] of the world." Somebody say, "Amen."
[57:40] &gt;&gt; Abraham separated. He went out into the
[57:42] wilderness. Yes, sir. He was trying to
[57:43] get to a place that God was calling him.
[57:45] And the Bible says, "But then Abram, he
[57:47] passed through the land unto a place of
[57:48] scum into the plain of Mory. And the
[57:51] Lord appeared unto Abram and said, "Unto
[57:53] thy seed will I give this land."
[57:56] Somebody say this.
[57:59] &gt;&gt; Notice when he started his walk, he
[58:01] didn't know what this was.
[58:03] &gt;&gt; He didn't know what land he was going
[58:05] to. But when he got in the middle of
[58:07] this land, I love the word because the
[58:10] Bible says, "I will give them this
[58:13] land."
[58:14] &gt;&gt; So here, God identifies it. This is what
[58:16] we were speaking on Sunday. And the
[58:17] Bible said he built an altar to the Lord
[58:19] who appeared unto him. See, I want you
[58:21] to catch this portion is that Abraham
[58:24] was standing in it and then God revealed
[58:26] it.
[58:27] &gt;&gt; Amen. See, so here's a key to
[58:29] understanding Abraham's walk with God is
[58:32] his revelation only came after
[58:34] separation.
[58:36] &gt;&gt; So here he had to separate from things.
[58:38] He had to cut things out of his life. He
[58:40] had to he had to take a walk with God
[58:42] and he had to walk by faith not even
[58:43] knowing where he was going. He didn't
[58:45] have all the answers to all of his
[58:46] questions. But after he separated and he
[58:48] went out, then he got right in the
[58:50] middle of it and God said, "This is the
[58:51] land
[58:52] &gt;&gt; that I have given you." See, it takes
[58:54] separation. It took separation to see
[58:56] the promise. It wasn't something that
[58:58] Abraham could see from a far off. And
[59:00] that's I think that's the way it is.
[59:01] Most people look at the life of God or
[59:03] the life of a of a believer and they
[59:05] look at it from a ways off and say,
[59:06] "Well, I don't know if I could live like
[59:08] that. I I don't know if I could go to
[59:09] church down there at Grace Tabernacle. I
[59:11] I don't know if I could live like they
[59:12] live. I don't know I could dress like
[59:14] that. I don't know if I could act like
[59:15] that." See, and and they're trying to to
[59:18] judge it from a long way off. But let me
[59:20] tell you what Abraham had to do. He just
[59:21] had to go down there and get in the
[59:22] middle of it and walk with God by faith
[59:25] and say, "Well, I don't know what it is,
[59:26] but for some reason, God has pulled me
[59:29] here and some reason God has called me
[59:31] in this direction." And then when he got
[59:33] in and he obeyed the call of God, then
[59:35] when he got right in the middle of it,
[59:37] the revelation came from God. This is
[59:39] why you're here.
[59:41] &gt;&gt; This is your purpose of being here.
[59:44] &gt;&gt; See, he had to walk in it in order to
[59:45] see it.
[59:46] &gt;&gt; It's so hard to do from a far off. He
[59:48] had to walk in it in order to see it. He
[59:49] had to walk by faith and just follow
[59:51] God. And when God put that inkling on
[59:53] his heart, you go here and follow the
[59:55] follow follow me and you come follow. He
[59:57] had to follow the the the will of God in
[59:59] order to be able to see what God was
[1:00:00] even promised to him. See, had God and
[1:00:02] think about it. Had God not identified
[1:00:04] it, he would have never even recognized
[1:00:06] it. Abraham would have walked right
[1:00:07] through that land. That's how much he
[1:00:08] didn't know it. But when he got down in
[1:00:10] there, God said, "But this is it."
[1:00:12] &gt;&gt; See, so what God makes us do is
[1:00:13] separate. And then whenever we separate
[1:00:15] and we take a step and we start walking
[1:00:17] by faith, all of a sudden you'll get
[1:00:19] right in the middle of it. And one day,
[1:00:20] God just says, "This is it. This is what
[1:00:22] I called you to. This is what I brought
[1:00:24] you here for. This is what I raised you
[1:00:26] for. This is why you came through what
[1:00:28] you came through. This is the purpose of
[1:00:30] being here."
[1:00:31] &gt;&gt; See, a lot of times we got to get right
[1:00:32] in the midst of something before we can
[1:00:34] see it. We're right in the middle of of
[1:00:36] what God is doing in our life. every I I
[1:00:39] friends almost every time
[1:00:41] &gt;&gt; we're right in the middle of what God is
[1:00:42] doing in our life and we don't even
[1:00:44] recognize it hear that God has something
[1:00:46] for you and we can't even see it. Have
[1:00:49] you ever looked at the promises of God
[1:00:50] coming to your life a far off that I'm
[1:00:53] gonna oh I see just up the road there's
[1:00:55] going to be such a joy that's going to
[1:00:56] come in my life in a few weeks I'm going
[1:00:58] to have such peace in a few weeks all
[1:01:00] these trials are going to be over in a
[1:01:01] few days you never look at them a far
[1:01:03] off but right when you're in the middle
[1:01:05] of it is when God reveals things to you
[1:01:07] and opens things up to you said see so
[1:01:10] sometimes you're right in the midst of
[1:01:11] something you can't see it we're walking
[1:01:13] all around the promises that God has
[1:01:15] given to us wondering if God is ever
[1:01:17] going to come through.
[1:01:19] &gt;&gt; We'll walk right over it. Pray to God.
[1:01:20] Ask God for something. Ask God for help.
[1:01:23] We're walking all over it. And here here
[1:01:24] you are. I don't know if God's ever
[1:01:26] going to do what I asked him. And I
[1:01:27] prayed and ask God for an answer to my
[1:01:29] question. And you know, I'm asking God
[1:01:31] for leadership. I've been doing
[1:01:32] everything I'm supposed to do. After
[1:01:34] all, I praying. I'm getting no answer.
[1:01:36] I've been standing, but I get no
[1:01:38] direction. I I'm a believer. I've been
[1:01:40] going to church. I've been serving God.
[1:01:42] I've been feeding on the word of God.
[1:01:44] But really what we need is a revelation
[1:01:47] is that we're standing right where God
[1:01:49] wants us to be in the midst of the
[1:01:51] greatest trials in our life. The best
[1:01:53] thing that could happen to us is to
[1:01:54] recognize that we're standing where God
[1:01:57] wants us to be. It ain't about how bad
[1:01:58] it is or how big our trials are. But
[1:02:01] just because there's trouble around you,
[1:02:03] it don't mean that you aren't where God
[1:02:05] wants you to be.
[1:02:06] &gt;&gt; Just because there's great troubles,
[1:02:08] many trials that we all face, it don't
[1:02:10] mean that you're not standing right in
[1:02:11] the will of God.
[1:02:12] Can
[1:02:12] &gt;&gt; I take Job for a minute?
[1:02:14] &gt;&gt; The Bible tells us the story of Job and
[1:02:17] how that we find Job sitting on a an ash
[1:02:20] heap, a a pile of ashes, a heap of
[1:02:23] ashes. And the Bible said he was sitting
[1:02:25] and scraping bulls off of his body
[1:02:27] because he had had received such
[1:02:30] terrible news. His barns had burned to
[1:02:32] the ground. His his fields had been
[1:02:34] burned. His crops had been burned. All
[1:02:36] of his possessions have had been lost.
[1:02:39] He was a man of great wealth. They had
[1:02:40] uh so many great things. He was a man of
[1:02:43] God, a righteous man, a prophet of God.
[1:02:45] He had done all these things, right? But
[1:02:46] now everything in Job's life had fallen
[1:02:48] apart.
[1:02:49] &gt;&gt; He had lost his children. He had lost
[1:02:51] his his his livestock. Everything that
[1:02:54] was precious to him had been lost. And
[1:02:56] you know, when you when you read the
[1:02:58] life of Job, you can't ever find another
[1:03:00] man that was in worse shape than Job was
[1:03:02] in.
[1:03:03] &gt;&gt; Terrible shape.
[1:03:04] &gt;&gt; And he was sitting on a heap of ashes.
[1:03:07] Yet, he was a righteous man. Amen.
[1:03:09] &gt;&gt; Everything had fallen apart, but he was
[1:03:11] a righteous man.
[1:03:13] &gt;&gt; And here, whenever you listen to Job,
[1:03:15] you can you can you can start to pick up
[1:03:17] Job was in a miserable shape.
[1:03:19] &gt;&gt; He he was miserable. He the things that
[1:03:22] he says, it was it was spoken as true
[1:03:24] misery. He he was a man that would just
[1:03:26] soon be dead. He if he could just if he
[1:03:29] could just just take my life and let me
[1:03:30] be done with it. He he was in that kind
[1:03:32] he was in that kind of a shape. And
[1:03:34] because he was in that shape, because
[1:03:36] everything around him had brought him to
[1:03:38] this place, he begins to question and he
[1:03:40] asked these questions. You know, if a
[1:03:41] flower dies, it comes back in the
[1:03:43] spring. If a tender branch would fall
[1:03:45] off of a tree, it brings forth life
[1:03:47] again. He said, "But if a man die, shall
[1:03:50] he live again?" You notice why he's
[1:03:51] asking these questions? Because he had
[1:03:52] 10 children that had just died.
[1:03:54] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[1:03:55] &gt;&gt; So, he begins to ask, "All this
[1:03:56] happened, but what about if a man dies,
[1:03:59] can he still live again? all the days of
[1:04:01] my life, appointed time will I wait
[1:04:03] until my change come. And notice even
[1:04:05] while he was in this state and begin to
[1:04:07] question all this and ask these
[1:04:09] questions that his friends and family
[1:04:11] come around him and they start giving
[1:04:12] him all kinds of reasons why everything
[1:04:14] was wrong in his life. Isn't that just
[1:04:16] just like a good friend?
[1:04:17] &gt;&gt; Things start to fall apart and they come
[1:04:19] around start telling you, "Well, you
[1:04:20] know what? If you wouldn't went down
[1:04:21] there to that church, then that wouldn't
[1:04:23] you wouldn't had your car wouldn't have
[1:04:24] broke down. Or if you hadn't went over
[1:04:26] to that meeting, then you know what? You
[1:04:27] may maybe nobody would have stole the
[1:04:29] money out of your bank account, you
[1:04:30] know, if you hadn't went and got
[1:04:32] baptized like that. Well, maybe your
[1:04:33] children wouldn't be all these things
[1:04:35] that people just the silly things that
[1:04:37] that our friends and family come up with
[1:04:40] &gt;&gt; because of our calamity.
[1:04:42] &gt;&gt; So, they start giving Job all these
[1:04:44] things and things that's happened and
[1:04:45] all kinds of reason why he was in this
[1:04:47] shape. I love what Job says. He said,
[1:04:48] "I've heard I've heard many such things
[1:04:51] and miserable comforters." All of you
[1:04:52] are. Uh, all of y'all are the most
[1:04:55] miserable comforters that God has ever
[1:04:58] sent to anybody. Y'all, y'all are the
[1:04:59] worst comforters I've ever seen. Y'all,
[1:05:01] here I am in the time of distress. I've
[1:05:03] lost my children. I've lost my home.
[1:05:05] I've lost my job. I've lost my
[1:05:07] lifestyle. Everything that I have, I've
[1:05:08] dedicated my life to God. And all you
[1:05:10] can do to offer comfort is to point out,
[1:05:12] well, where'd you mess up? And you must
[1:05:14] have failed God and you must have done
[1:05:15] something wrong. And maybe you ought to
[1:05:17] check your life. He said, y'all are
[1:05:18] miserable comforters. Come on.
[1:05:21] &gt;&gt; He said, I if I had, he said, if I if I
[1:05:24] your vain words, is there any end to it?
[1:05:25] He said, if I could speak as you do, if
[1:05:27] your soul is ever if you're ever in the
[1:05:29] shape that I'm in, I pray that I
[1:05:31] wouldn't heap them kind of words on you
[1:05:33] that you're heaping on me.
[1:05:35] &gt;&gt; He said, I pray I don't shake my head at
[1:05:37] you like you've been shaking your head
[1:05:38] at me. He said, but I wouldn't speak
[1:05:40] those kind of words. I would strengthen
[1:05:42] you with my mouth.
[1:05:43] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:05:44] &gt;&gt; Job giving him a little correction.
[1:05:46] &gt;&gt; He had found no comfort. Think about it.
[1:05:48] He had found no comfort in his own
[1:05:50] thoughts. He had found no comfort in the
[1:05:53] words of his friends. He was in a
[1:05:54] terrible condition. But notice that one
[1:05:57] thing happened that changed Job's
[1:06:00] perception of his condition.
[1:06:03] &gt;&gt; Right in the middle of all of this,
[1:06:05] Brother Joe, one thing took him off of
[1:06:07] an ash heap
[1:06:08] &gt;&gt; where he was sitting and cutting the
[1:06:10] bulls off his body with pieces of
[1:06:12] pottery. It was a revelation that came
[1:06:14] from God.
[1:06:15] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. See, you know, there's a lot
[1:06:18] of revelations that you can get. There's
[1:06:20] a man can, you realize a man can reveal
[1:06:22] things to you. Certainly, a man can
[1:06:24] reveal all sorts of carnal things to
[1:06:26] you. A man can teach you how to fix a
[1:06:28] motor. He can teach you how to wire up
[1:06:30] wiring. He can teach you how to build a
[1:06:32] building. A man can bring all sorts of
[1:06:34] carnal revelations to other men. But
[1:06:36] when it comes to spiritual things and
[1:06:38] things of God, then it takes God to
[1:06:40] reveal it. And see, this is the
[1:06:42] condition that Job was in. He wasn't
[1:06:44] dealing with man problems or flesh
[1:06:45] problems. Job was dealing with some real
[1:06:47] spiritual problems. He was in a he was
[1:06:49] in a terrible state spiritually. So, he
[1:06:51] began to call out to God. But then all
[1:06:53] of a sudden, the God of heaven came and
[1:06:55] brought a revelation to Job. Brother
[1:06:57] said, "Here's what we need." He said,
[1:06:58] "May God begin by his spirit to give us
[1:07:01] a continuous lifegiving and prevailing
[1:07:03] revelation." That's what the church
[1:07:05] needs tonight. He said if the church
[1:07:06] could get a fresh revelation and become
[1:07:08] by it the living word manifested then we
[1:07:11] would all do the greater works and g
[1:07:14] glorify God our father which is in
[1:07:16] heaven. That's why the prophet would say
[1:07:18] that we should pray for revelation more
[1:07:20] than anything else. It was revelation
[1:07:23] that changed the man Job's life. It was
[1:07:24] revelation that that that changed
[1:07:27] everything about it. He said that's what
[1:07:28] we need. It ain't just here. It ain't
[1:07:30] just in northeast Arkansas. But a
[1:07:32] prophet said in every city in the United
[1:07:33] States the world over, it needs a
[1:07:35] spiritual revelation of the resurrected
[1:07:38] power of the Lord Jesus Christ. It'll
[1:07:41] stop all juvenile delinquency. It'll
[1:07:43] make broken homes reunited again. It'll
[1:07:45] make this country so dry that
[1:07:47] bootleggers would have to be prime 30
[1:07:49] minutes to get enough moisture to spit.
[1:07:51] I'm telling you that what we need today
[1:07:53] is not a social affair, but we need a
[1:07:55] gospel that's preached in the power and
[1:07:58] the demonstration of the Holy Ghost back
[1:08:00] to a fellowship with the Lord Jesus
[1:08:02] Christ. Again, I know what happens with
[1:08:04] people today, they say, "Well, if we're
[1:08:06] going to have healing, then we need
[1:08:08] faith. If we're going to be saved, then
[1:08:10] we need faith. If we're going to
[1:08:11] believe, then we need faith." But let me
[1:08:13] tell you, said that there's all kinds of
[1:08:15] people that can believe it. There's all
[1:08:17] kinds of people that can't believe it.
[1:08:18] And there's all kinds of people that try
[1:08:20] to make believe it.
[1:08:21] &gt;&gt; He said, but in the audience of people
[1:08:22] when they come through these prayer
[1:08:24] lines, he said, you'll find out that
[1:08:26] there's some really good people and some
[1:08:27] will say, I'm trying hard to believe and
[1:08:30] then there's some that's trying to work
[1:08:31] themselves into it. Some can't do it at
[1:08:33] all. And others come through and it's
[1:08:35] just by grace. It seems like it's just
[1:08:37] given to them. Here they receive their
[1:08:39] healing. He said, but here's the
[1:08:41] difference. It's a real revelation. says
[1:08:44] see because faith is a revelation from
[1:08:46] God
[1:08:47] &gt;&gt; and it must be revealed first. So in
[1:08:50] order to get anything from God it first
[1:08:52] takes a revelation. You realize realize
[1:08:54] what Job had. Job all of the sudden he
[1:08:57] got a revelation of the resurrection. It
[1:09:00] was a revelation of resurrection power
[1:09:02] that and whenever Job caught this
[1:09:05] revelation, brother Mark, notice what it
[1:09:06] done. It gave Job a whole new outlook on
[1:09:09] life. Notice as everything he starts to
[1:09:12] talk about begins to change, as he
[1:09:14] perceives things, it begins to change.
[1:09:15] Because when he got a revelation of the
[1:09:18] power of resurrection, a a resurrection
[1:09:21] power and what it meant for a man to go
[1:09:23] into the ground and come back again. Oh
[1:09:25] my. Then Job, he be to think about what
[1:09:27] he had done for his children. He said,
[1:09:28] "I made my sacrifices for my children.
[1:09:31] Therefore, they are saved. I met God's
[1:09:33] requirements. Therefore, all hope is not
[1:09:35] lost." when it looked like I lost
[1:09:38] everything, but really I actually gained
[1:09:40] it all
[1:09:41] &gt;&gt; because his revelation changed. It
[1:09:43] changed his outlook on life.
[1:09:45] &gt;&gt; He said, "For I know that my redeemer
[1:09:47] liveth and that he shall stand at the
[1:09:49] latter day upon the earth and though
[1:09:52] after my skin worms destroy this body,
[1:09:54] yet in my flesh shall I see God."
[1:09:58] &gt;&gt; Oh, hallelujah. that Job's whole whole
[1:10:00] life begin to change. He said, "If a
[1:10:02] flower has redemption and a tree has
[1:10:04] redemption, then so does a man have
[1:10:06] redemption."
[1:10:07] &gt;&gt; Friends, I say if a prophet of God here
[1:10:10] when he caught that revelation that God
[1:10:12] could send a redeemer and redeem a
[1:10:14] fallen man.
[1:10:15] &gt;&gt; That very revelation is what will get
[1:10:18] you through every trial that you ever
[1:10:20] face. Amen.
[1:10:21] &gt;&gt; You realize this life is a few days and
[1:10:24] it's full of trouble
[1:10:25] &gt;&gt; in this life that that it's always it's
[1:10:28] filled with death and anxiety and
[1:10:30] depression and and emotional ups and
[1:10:32] downs. It's a it's a life that's filled
[1:10:34] with all kinds of sadness and heartache
[1:10:36] and and and and pains in this flesh, all
[1:10:39] the things that we go through. But Job
[1:10:40] caught a revelation that will get you
[1:10:42] past all of that.
[1:10:44] &gt;&gt; Said, "In my flesh, I will see God."
[1:10:48] &gt;&gt; Y'all hear what he's saying? in my flesh
[1:10:51] &gt;&gt; I will see God
[1:10:53] &gt;&gt; that I have a redeemer one day I'll
[1:10:56] resurrect into an eternal rest
[1:11:00] &gt;&gt; this is why Paul would preach this
[1:11:02] message he said see brethren he said the
[1:11:04] flesh and blood cannot inherit the
[1:11:06] kingdom of God neither does corruption
[1:11:09] inherit incorruption
[1:11:10] &gt;&gt; but I show you a mystery we shall not
[1:11:13] all sleep but we shall all be changed
[1:11:17] &gt;&gt; some of us will go by the way of the
[1:11:19] grave Some of us go in a rapture. One
[1:11:20] thing's for certain, we will all be
[1:11:22] changed.
[1:11:22] &gt;&gt; He said, "In a moment, in the twinkling
[1:11:24] of an eye, at the last trump, for the
[1:11:26] trumpet shall sound and the dead shall
[1:11:28] be raised incorruptible,
[1:11:29] &gt;&gt; and we shall be changed.
[1:11:31] &gt;&gt; For this corruptible must put on
[1:11:33] incorruption, this mortal must put on
[1:11:35] immortality. So when this corruptible
[1:11:37] shall have put on incorruption, and this
[1:11:39] mortal shall have put on immortality,
[1:11:42] then shall be brought to pass the saying
[1:11:44] that is written, that death has been
[1:11:46] swallowed up in victory. Oh death, where
[1:11:49] is thy sting? And oh grave, where is thy
[1:11:52] victory. I love a man that can mock
[1:11:54] death because he recognized the power of
[1:11:56] resurrection. He said, "Death, where is
[1:11:58] thy sting?" The greatest fear that man
[1:12:00] has is death. The greatest fear that the
[1:12:03] thing that we're afraid of is what can
[1:12:04] come and take our life. But Paul could
[1:12:06] stand right up in the face of death and
[1:12:08] has such a revelation. He said, "Oh
[1:12:10] death, where is thy sin? And great,
[1:12:12] where is thy victory?" When he caught
[1:12:14] that revelation, he realized that sin
[1:12:17] can't have a victory over a child of
[1:12:19] God. Somebody say amen.
[1:12:21] &gt;&gt; I'm talking about life. The trials of
[1:12:22] this life. When you look at it, you can
[1:12:24] look at your trials and say trials,
[1:12:26] you've lost your victory. Death, you've
[1:12:28] lost your uh your sting and pressures,
[1:12:31] you've lost your ability to hold me
[1:12:32] down.
[1:12:33] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:12:34] &gt;&gt; Because I know who I am.
[1:12:36] &gt;&gt; And from whence I came and where I'm
[1:12:38] going. I know that this life is just a
[1:12:40] few days, a few short years, 70, 80, 90
[1:12:42] years if you're lucky. You might get out
[1:12:44] of this life in the face of eternity. It
[1:12:46] ain't nothing but just a spot, just a
[1:12:48] blip on the radar.
[1:12:50] &gt;&gt; The revelation that these men of God
[1:12:52] &gt;&gt; caught. And I realize that each one of
[1:12:55] us, you think about this tonight, that
[1:12:57] every one of us have had our own ash
[1:12:59] heap.
[1:13:00] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[1:13:01] &gt;&gt; Think about yours.
[1:13:05] You realize each one of us, we have may
[1:13:07] had many of them. We've all had our own
[1:13:10] ash heap. We've all had places in our
[1:13:13] life that
[1:13:15] that we were sitting and holding the
[1:13:17] remnants of our own efforts and the the
[1:13:20] pieces of our failures and things that
[1:13:22] &gt;&gt; that we had built and we picked up
[1:13:24] pieces of our of our life and held them
[1:13:26] in our hands and pondered on how that
[1:13:29] things got into that kind of shape.
[1:13:32] failed relationships, failed jobs, and
[1:13:34] failed failed commitments, all the many
[1:13:38] things that we've done that just seem
[1:13:39] like it fell apart. We've all had our
[1:13:42] own ashes. And most of the time, it hits
[1:13:46] you the hardest whenever you feel like
[1:13:48] you're doing everything right. I didn't
[1:13:50] do nothing wrong. I felt like I was
[1:13:51] following the best I could to be a an
[1:13:54] upright man and do everything that God
[1:13:57] called me to do. But now everything in
[1:13:59] my life has fallen apart all around me.
[1:14:02] And I want to ask you this. What does
[1:14:04] what do you think an ash heap actually
[1:14:06] represents?
[1:14:07] When you think of an ash heap, you see,
[1:14:09] most time people would look at it and
[1:14:11] say, well, you know, it's all the great
[1:14:12] trials and things that had happened and
[1:14:14] the the failures that had happened and
[1:14:16] all the the things that had happened in
[1:14:17] Job's life. But that really that's not
[1:14:19] what an ash heap is at all. It's not a
[1:14:21] when you when you think of the the
[1:14:23] reference of a person sitting on a heap
[1:14:26] of ashes. But Mark, it's not the trials.
[1:14:28] It wasn't it wasn't it wasn't all the
[1:14:30] things that had happened in Job's life
[1:14:32] that was that was the the metaphor. But
[1:14:35] but it actually what it is it was when
[1:14:38] Job was sitting there and he was
[1:14:40] pointing out everything bad that had
[1:14:42] happened in his life. So it wasn't the
[1:14:45] ash heap was not all the things that had
[1:14:47] happened, but the ash heap experience
[1:14:49] was the spiritual state of a man
[1:14:51] following a trial.
[1:14:53] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:14:53] &gt;&gt; So when you say, "Well, they're sitting
[1:14:54] on an ash heap." Well, it ain't that
[1:14:56] there's trials that's happened. It's the
[1:14:57] spiritual state of a man because of his
[1:15:00] trials.
[1:15:01] &gt;&gt; See, everything had failed around Job
[1:15:03] and now he was sitting there had gave up
[1:15:05] on everything, questioning everything
[1:15:07] about his life. He was scraping bulls
[1:15:09] off of his body, questioning things of
[1:15:11] God. Qu brother Mark, his spirit had
[1:15:13] been torn down to nothing. So, so this
[1:15:15] ash heap experience is is the state of
[1:15:17] the man after these trials and things
[1:15:20] that befallen his life. So, see, it was
[1:15:22] it was such a a terrible condition. You
[1:15:24] say, "Well, you say, "Well, Job was on
[1:15:26] an ash heap." Well, the reason he was,
[1:15:27] it was his response to his trial. It
[1:15:30] broke him down. Job wasn't up cleaning
[1:15:32] up debris. He wasn't building rebuilding
[1:15:35] barns. He wasn't out there with with
[1:15:37] with some servants and and trying to
[1:15:39] clean up his land and replant crops.
[1:15:41] None of that was going on. Job was
[1:15:43] sitting on an ash sheep. It was talking
[1:15:44] about his spiritual state
[1:15:46] &gt;&gt; because everything around him had fallen
[1:15:48] apart.
[1:15:50] &gt;&gt; He was mourning his losses. He was
[1:15:52] licking his wounds. I say it like that.
[1:15:55] &gt;&gt; In other words, he was in a state of
[1:15:57] self-pity
[1:15:58] &gt;&gt; because of the things that had taken
[1:16:00] place in his life.
[1:16:01] &gt;&gt; But in the middle of all of this, this
[1:16:03] is when God showed up
[1:16:06] &gt;&gt; here. Because of his spiritual state and
[1:16:08] because of the condition he was in
[1:16:10] spiritually, God came in a whirlwind. He
[1:16:12] began to speak to Job and he brought him
[1:16:14] a revelation of the resurrection.
[1:16:16] Hallelujah. Come on,
[1:16:17] &gt;&gt; brother Mark. That revelation, it caused
[1:16:19] my I don't know about y'all. It just
[1:16:20] does something to me tonight.
[1:16:22] &gt;&gt; To think about what it caused that man
[1:16:24] to do, a man that had so much happened
[1:16:26] in his life. And it caused him to stand
[1:16:28] up again and go back to work and say,
[1:16:30] "Well, we'll just have to build another
[1:16:32] barn, and I guess we'll have to go buy
[1:16:34] some more sheep and some more oxen, and
[1:16:35] I guess we'll have to get some more
[1:16:37] camels, and well, we'll have to find
[1:16:38] some more servants, and we're going to
[1:16:40] have to go go out and plow some lamb.
[1:16:42] We're going to have to get to work." And
[1:16:43] the Bible said that the latter state of
[1:16:44] that man that God doubled everything
[1:16:46] that he had lost.
[1:16:48] &gt;&gt; And Job caught such a revelation. See,
[1:16:51] that's what it takes is a revelation to
[1:16:53] get us to this place that we can receive
[1:16:55] a divine promise of God. It changes our
[1:16:57] whole spiritual state is a revelation of
[1:16:59] the resurrection. You know, there's many
[1:17:01] people that find themselves in these
[1:17:02] state just like you and I. I was
[1:17:04] thinking about the disciples and one day
[1:17:06] the Bible tells us the condition after
[1:17:08] the crucifixion that they were in a
[1:17:10] state of such discouragement. Think of
[1:17:12] how that that that they were so crushed
[1:17:14] and disappointed because this man that
[1:17:16] they were following had been crucified.
[1:17:19] But Abram tells the story. He said they
[1:17:20] had seen their savior, the one that they
[1:17:22] had loved and had seen him even raise
[1:17:24] the dead from the grave. And they seen
[1:17:26] him do that and think there he was lay
[1:17:27] cold in a grave himself this morning.
[1:17:30] And he said those people who had seen
[1:17:32] him open the eyes of the blind. They
[1:17:33] seen him stand there and perceive the
[1:17:35] very thoughts that was in people's
[1:17:36] heart. How did he know that they had say
[1:17:38] that that them that were coming after
[1:17:40] him? How did he not know if he knew the
[1:17:42] thoughts that was in people's heart? How
[1:17:44] did he not know Judas was going to
[1:17:46] betray him? If he knew the thoughts that
[1:17:47] was in people's heart, how did he not
[1:17:49] know that there were soldiers that were
[1:17:50] coming up the mountain that have stabs
[1:17:52] and swords? If he knew all these things
[1:17:54] and he and he had that that ability or
[1:17:56] or that gift, how could he not perceive
[1:17:58] this? How could he not perceive their
[1:18:00] thoughts? But Abraham said, "See, but
[1:18:02] what was taking place is the devil was
[1:18:04] working on them trying to pull them onto
[1:18:07] an ash heap." That's right.
[1:18:09] &gt;&gt; So here, because of a condition or
[1:18:11] something that had taken place in their
[1:18:12] life, and they started to lose their
[1:18:14] faith, and then their mind begin to go
[1:18:15] back. Well, well, why didn't if if Jesus
[1:18:17] was really all that he said he was, and
[1:18:19] he ought to do that, did the whole time,
[1:18:21] look what the devil was doing, he was
[1:18:22] dragging him right up and ashy. They
[1:18:24] they they could find this place where
[1:18:26] they would just completely give up
[1:18:28] because all their hope was lost. He
[1:18:29] said, "See that they he was dragging
[1:18:31] them, trying to drag them up an ash
[1:18:32] sheet." But let me tell you something.
[1:18:34] God will never leave you on an ash heap.
[1:18:37] Every one of us, we can find things in
[1:18:39] our life where Satan has drugg us all
[1:18:41] the way to the top. You say, "I don't
[1:18:43] know why I'm thinking these thoughts,
[1:18:44] and I I don't know why I'm doubting God.
[1:18:46] I don't know why I'm just going to
[1:18:47] preach anyhow, but I don't know why I
[1:18:48] feel this way. I don't know why these
[1:18:50] things have happened." You know, if God
[1:18:51] loved me, he wouldn't let that happen to
[1:18:53] my life. And if God cared about me, he
[1:18:55] wouldn't let my life get in this kind of
[1:18:57] condition the whole time. It's just the
[1:18:59] devil trying to drag us up on an ash
[1:19:00] sheep.
[1:19:01] &gt;&gt; But God God ain't going to leave you on
[1:19:03] an ash sheep. God has a way to get you
[1:19:05] off of it.
[1:19:06] &gt;&gt; You say, "Well, what was it?" It's a
[1:19:07] revelation.
[1:19:08] &gt;&gt; See, notice what took place. It was a
[1:19:10] revelation of what? It was resurrection
[1:19:12] power. Here, notice where they find
[1:19:14] themselves in the Bible. The Bible says
[1:19:16] when they got in this condition, Peter
[1:19:18] decides, I'm just going to go back to
[1:19:20] fishing. That's what he was doing.
[1:19:21] Whenever Jesus found him, he said,
[1:19:22] "Here, Jesus had gone. He had been
[1:19:24] crucified. I don't know where he lay. I
[1:19:26] don't know what they did with him. I
[1:19:28] don't know why if he had all that power,
[1:19:29] why why didn't he why didn't he just
[1:19:31] call angels and and how he let him take
[1:19:33] his life? I'll just go back to fishing.
[1:19:36] &gt;&gt; So he went and he got his boat and his
[1:19:37] fishing pole back out in the waters he
[1:19:39] went. What God had called him out of,
[1:19:40] right back he went
[1:19:42] &gt;&gt; right back to the waters. You know what
[1:19:44] the other disciples did? Peter was a he
[1:19:46] was a natural-born leader. And the other
[1:19:48] disciples, a bunch of them wasn't even
[1:19:50] fishermen. But when Peter went back to
[1:19:51] fishing, they said, "Well, we don't know
[1:19:52] what to do." So guess what? We just be
[1:19:54] fishermen with you. So off to the waters
[1:19:56] they all went
[1:19:58] &gt;&gt; and out in the water they went and they
[1:19:59] fished all night and tried to, you know,
[1:20:02] Peter's going back. I'll just go fall
[1:20:03] back to what I used to do.
[1:20:05] &gt;&gt; And he fished all night long. I'll just
[1:20:07] I'll just I I'll just depend on I'll
[1:20:09] just depend on my own abilities and I'll
[1:20:11] just depend on my job and I'll take care
[1:20:13] of myself. I've asked God for some
[1:20:14] financial help and God ain't never
[1:20:16] showed up and I' I've asked him to help
[1:20:18] me. He ain't never showed up. He ain't
[1:20:20] never helped me in any way. I think I'm
[1:20:22] just gonna give up on serving God and
[1:20:24] I'm gonna take care of my family myself.
[1:20:26] &gt;&gt; I'm gonna work my job. I'm gonna take
[1:20:27] care of me.
[1:20:29] &gt;&gt; That's what Peter did.
[1:20:31] &gt;&gt; Went out fishing. Fished all night. You
[1:20:33] know how many fish he caught? Zero.
[1:20:36] &gt;&gt; Never caught a fish. Fished all night
[1:20:38] long. Then all of a sudden, as they come
[1:20:41] at the end of the night, right at the
[1:20:44] break of day, the sun
[1:20:46] &gt;&gt; comes up over the sea.
[1:20:48] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. here in that sunrise comes
[1:20:51] over on the eastern shore at the morning
[1:20:54] of resurrection.
[1:20:55] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:20:56] &gt;&gt; Up on the bank there stands a man
[1:20:59] &gt;&gt; that calls out to them in their boat. He
[1:21:01] says, "Hey, have you any meat?" Can I
[1:21:03] say it like nowadays?
[1:21:05] &gt;&gt; Y'all catching anything?
[1:21:08] &gt;&gt; Y'all catching anything?
[1:21:11] &gt;&gt; Peter responded, "No, we ain't caught
[1:21:14] nothing. Fished all night. Never caught
[1:21:16] nothing."
[1:21:17] &gt;&gt; They didn't know who the man was. didn't
[1:21:18] recognize him. They never saw that man
[1:21:21] before. But then he spoke a familiar
[1:21:25] word.
[1:21:27] He speaks out and he says, "Why don't
[1:21:29] you cast your net on the other side?"
[1:21:32] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:21:33] &gt;&gt; I can imagine Peter standing in that
[1:21:35] boat when he hears these words.
[1:21:37] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:21:38] &gt;&gt; It's all night they've been toiling. I'm
[1:21:39] just going to go back to fishing.
[1:21:40] &gt;&gt; Fished all night. Never caught nothing.
[1:21:42] Couldn't even provide for theirel.
[1:21:44] &gt;&gt; But then he says, "Cast your net on the
[1:21:45] other side." Maybe Peter turned around
[1:21:47] the boat and said, "You know, I've heard
[1:21:50] that before."
[1:21:50] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:21:52] &gt;&gt; And he been his mind be to go back about
[1:21:54] three years ago
[1:21:55] &gt;&gt; when he was a devout fisherman.
[1:21:57] &gt;&gt; He was dedicated to that work. And that
[1:21:59] time whenever he was doubting when they
[1:22:01] came to him and told him that the
[1:22:03] Messiah was here,
[1:22:04] &gt;&gt; I don't know about all that. I, you
[1:22:06] know, I know that he's coming, but why
[1:22:07] would he come in our day? You know, he
[1:22:09] just put it off to another day. It'll be
[1:22:10] in the future sometime. I'm sure the
[1:22:11] Lord will come, but I don't know if
[1:22:12] it'll be with the day I'm living in. He
[1:22:14] just put it off to some other time. But
[1:22:16] then one day he was sitting there
[1:22:17] fishing and Jesus called out to him
[1:22:18] after he couldn't catch fish all night.
[1:22:20] He said, "Cast your net on the other
[1:22:22] side." He said, "I remember what
[1:22:24] happened when I threw my net over there.
[1:22:25] We had so many fish that we couldn't put
[1:22:27] them back in the boat and then he needed
[1:22:28] to borrow a boat and we loaned it to him
[1:22:30] and he got to preaching to people and
[1:22:31] and he converted their lives and then he
[1:22:33] done miracle after miracle and I fell in
[1:22:35] love with him and I followed him and I
[1:22:37] gave my life and my heart to him
[1:22:40] &gt;&gt; and he heard those words again. cast
[1:22:42] your net on the other side.
[1:22:44] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:22:44] &gt;&gt; Said, "What do you want to do?" Peter
[1:22:46] said, "I don't know, but I've heard
[1:22:47] that." Something began to ring out in
[1:22:49] his heart here. When he just failed to
[1:22:51] give up, he said, "I don't know. Just
[1:22:53] throw the nets out, boys, to see what
[1:22:54] happens." So here, they may not even had
[1:22:57] any faith to even know what would
[1:22:58] happen. But you know what they did? They
[1:22:59] obeyed the word that they heard and they
[1:23:01] threw their net out on the other side.
[1:23:03] And the Bible says whenever they pulled
[1:23:05] their net up, here they come dragging
[1:23:07] out 153 fish out out of the net that it
[1:23:10] was so much that they couldn't even hold
[1:23:12] them in the boat and they drug them all
[1:23:14] back in the boat again and begin to roll
[1:23:16] up to shore. And brother Bam said all of
[1:23:18] a sudden, he said they looked over on
[1:23:19] the bank and that same kind of a
[1:23:21] revelation that Job got, he said they
[1:23:24] saw what Job had seen 4,000 years
[1:23:26] before, there stood the redeemer alive
[1:23:29] and fresh, standing on the bank of a
[1:23:31] river with a fire made and fish cooked
[1:23:34] on it and inviting them to come and eat
[1:23:36] with him. I thought, "My, isn't that the
[1:23:38] power of God that even in the time of
[1:23:40] their distress, in the time of their
[1:23:43] giving up, and in the time that I'm just
[1:23:45] going to turn back and go back to my old
[1:23:47] way of life, but Jesus showed up on the
[1:23:49] scene and he performed a miracle of
[1:23:51] resurrection, showing the power of his
[1:23:54] resurrection. He created fish in the net
[1:23:57] of a fisherman. And then this what Jesus
[1:23:59] said, he invited them to a fish fry.
[1:24:01] Well, let me tell you, he had a grill
[1:24:02] already made. I don't know about y'all,
[1:24:04] but that's something I want to be
[1:24:05] invited to is a fish fry with Jesus on
[1:24:08] the bank of the river. The Bible said he
[1:24:10] had fish already cooking and bread
[1:24:12] already made. He said, "You boys just
[1:24:14] bring your fish and bring them and
[1:24:16] combine them with mine and come and die
[1:24:19] cuz the master callth."
[1:24:22] &gt;&gt; The revelation of a resurrection power,
[1:24:25] brother Mark, listen what it was. The
[1:24:27] revelation of resurrection power was an
[1:24:30] invitation to come and dine with the
[1:24:32] master. So when he gave that revelation,
[1:24:34] it was for a purpose of dining with them
[1:24:36] again. I don't know about y'all, they
[1:24:38] had a they had a fellowship fish fry
[1:24:40] around the revelation of the
[1:24:42] resurrection
[1:24:43] &gt;&gt; here. They never doubted it again. The
[1:24:45] whole time they just said, "Well, I
[1:24:46] don't know about this resurrection
[1:24:47] business. And I don't know if he's
[1:24:49] really a redeemer. I don't know if he
[1:24:50] can build it uh rebuild that temple in
[1:24:52] three days." But after that revelation
[1:24:54] struck their heart, they sat on the bank
[1:24:56] of the river and they feasted on the
[1:24:58] fish that God had given them with the
[1:25:00] Lord Jesus.
[1:25:02] He didn't look the same. But let me tell
[1:25:03] you what the Bible says. The Bible says
[1:25:05] none of them asked him who he was.
[1:25:07] Although they could not recognize him,
[1:25:09] but none of them asked him who he was,
[1:25:11] for they knew it was the Lord.
[1:25:14] &gt;&gt; Say, well, how did they know it was the
[1:25:15] Lord? It was by the power of the
[1:25:17] resurrection.
[1:25:18] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:25:19] &gt;&gt; You see, notice why you say, "What did
[1:25:20] they notice?" Because, see, see, when he
[1:25:22] revealed it to them, it was something
[1:25:23] that he had done before.
[1:25:25] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:25:25] &gt;&gt; And when he re when it was revealed to
[1:25:27] them, notice what happened. All of their
[1:25:29] former trouble was forgotten.
[1:25:32] &gt;&gt; Friends, I'm going to tell you, I can't
[1:25:34] think of anything greater than God
[1:25:36] revealing himself in the midst of a
[1:25:39] trial.
[1:25:40] &gt;&gt; Isn't that the greatest feeling?
[1:25:42] &gt;&gt; For God to come and reveal himself to
[1:25:44] you right in the midst of a trial or
[1:25:46] right in the midst of a storm. For God
[1:25:47] to show up in the That's when it means
[1:25:49] the most to you.
[1:25:51] &gt;&gt; In the midst of great trial.
[1:25:53] &gt;&gt; We all have trials.
[1:25:56] We all have great things that we go
[1:25:58] through. Brother Bam said, "But remember
[1:26:00] those trials. They're brought upon you
[1:26:02] the same way so that you'll not say,
[1:26:04] "Maybe this is right. Maybe the
[1:26:06] scripture is true. Maybe divine healing
[1:26:08] is right. Maybe the Holy Ghost is
[1:26:09] right." But when you get the experience
[1:26:12] and you come off of that ash heap and
[1:26:14] you get the revelation of God by the
[1:26:16] baptism of the Holy Ghost, then you can
[1:26:18] scream, "I know my redeemer liveth
[1:26:21] because he lives in me." I wonder how
[1:26:23] many scream that out today. How many How
[1:26:25] many's had that experience? They can
[1:26:26] say, "I know my redeemer liveth because
[1:26:29] he lives in me." Friend, don't you
[1:26:31] realize that God, he brings every one of
[1:26:33] us to that place that to come off of
[1:26:35] this ash heap and and receive a
[1:26:37] revelation from God. He said, "See, what
[1:26:39] are we doing now? We're feeding on the
[1:26:41] revelation of the resurrection." But
[1:26:43] Mark, this is the revelation that David
[1:26:45] had whenever he would write about it. He
[1:26:47] said, "Though I walk through the valley
[1:26:48] of the shadow of death, I will fear no
[1:26:50] evil, for thou art with me. Thy rod and
[1:26:53] thy staff, they comfort me. What a
[1:26:55] revelation it is to know that God has
[1:26:57] been there all along.
[1:26:58] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:26:58] &gt;&gt; I know I run out of time,
[1:27:00] &gt;&gt; but what a revelation it is to know
[1:27:02] that's what David knew that God, you're
[1:27:03] with me no matter where I go. When I was
[1:27:05] born, he was there. When I was in my
[1:27:07] fallen state, I'm going to hurry and
[1:27:08] quit. He was there. When I needed grace,
[1:27:10] he was there. I wonder how many's got
[1:27:12] that revelation. It don't matter where
[1:27:13] I've ever been. God was there. He said,
[1:27:16] "Though he beset beside me, and before
[1:27:19] he laid thine hand upon me, such
[1:27:21] knowledge is too wonderful to me, it is
[1:27:24] so high, I cannot even attain it.
[1:27:26] Whether shall I go to get away from thy
[1:27:28] spirit? For when I flee from thy or
[1:27:31] where can I go to flee from your
[1:27:32] presence? If I ascend up into heaven,
[1:27:35] you are there. If I make my bed in hell,
[1:27:37] you are there. If I take the wings of
[1:27:39] the morning and dwell in the uttermost
[1:27:41] parts of the sea, even there shall thy
[1:27:44] hand lead me." and thy right hand shall
[1:27:46] hold me. If I say darkness shall cover
[1:27:49] me, even the night shall be light around
[1:27:52] about me. Yay, the darkness hideth not
[1:27:54] from me, but the night shineth as the
[1:27:56] day. For the darkness and the light are
[1:27:58] both alike unto thee. For thou hast
[1:28:00] possessed my reigns, and you've covered
[1:28:02] me in my mother's womb. And I will
[1:28:05] praise thee, for I am fearfully and
[1:28:07] wonderfully made. Marvelous are thy
[1:28:09] works, and that my soul knoweth right
[1:28:11] well. Amen.
[1:28:12] &gt;&gt; It was a revelation, brother Mark. A
[1:28:14] revelation that God has been there all
[1:28:17] along.
[1:28:18] &gt;&gt; Death, burial, and resurrection. It's
[1:28:20] the same God, the same power. He's been
[1:28:22] there all along. It's the same Jesus
[1:28:24] being revealed. Let me tell you what it
[1:28:26] does. This revelation, it doesn't just
[1:28:28] change you,
[1:28:29] &gt;&gt; but it changes those around you.
[1:28:32] &gt;&gt; Because listen what happens. every man
[1:28:33] or woman in the Bible that's ever had
[1:28:35] that kind of a revelation when they
[1:28:37] caught that not only were they a
[1:28:38] receiver of the revelation but they
[1:28:40] became the revelation they received.
[1:28:42] &gt;&gt; Yes sir.
[1:28:42] &gt;&gt; So here whenever they got the revelation
[1:28:45] of this resurrected power then they
[1:28:48] became that
[1:28:49] &gt;&gt; and they became a representative of it
[1:28:51] in the world that they lived in and now
[1:28:53] others can see that revelation in them.
[1:28:55] That's why brother man would say each
[1:28:57] generation as a music players want to
[1:28:59] come. He said each generation reveals
[1:29:01] him in the full revelation that's
[1:29:03] laotted for that time. He said and this
[1:29:06] generation must reveal Jesus Christ.
[1:29:09] That's the revelation of him that's
[1:29:11] promised in the word. It must be
[1:29:12] revealed to his to this generation. And
[1:29:15] if the churches won't receive it, then
[1:29:18] somebody will rise up and do it.
[1:29:20] &gt;&gt; Let me ask you this. I know you may come
[1:29:23] in here feeling like a nobody, but how
[1:29:25] many somebodyies do we have in here? He
[1:29:27] said, "If the church won't receive it,
[1:29:29] that revelation and live it, but then
[1:29:31] somebody is going to rise up and do it."
[1:29:34] May not be a big group. It might not be
[1:29:35] an organization. The church may not
[1:29:37] receive it. The world may not receive
[1:29:39] it. But let me tell you who will. The
[1:29:40] bride of Jesus Christ will receive it.
[1:29:43] &gt;&gt; She'll receive the resurrection,
[1:29:45] &gt;&gt; the revelation of the power of his
[1:29:47] resurrection, that he's not just some
[1:29:50] dead god laying in a tomb somewhere. But
[1:29:52] this bride will receive it. Not only
[1:29:53] will she see it, she'll believe it.
[1:29:55] She'll receive it. and then she'll
[1:29:57] declare it.
[1:29:58] &gt;&gt; And regardless of our circumstances,
[1:30:01] we'll declare him
[1:30:03] &gt;&gt; regardless of where we sit, regardless
[1:30:06] of our failures, regardless of the
[1:30:09] things that fall around our life,
[1:30:13] but we will declare him. I say tonight
[1:30:15] as you stand to your feet,
[1:30:18] let our lives manifest the power of his
[1:30:22] resurrection. You realize what power
[1:30:24] that we're living under? That's the
[1:30:27] power of the message of the hour. You
[1:30:28] think the church world could declare a
[1:30:32] god of history.
[1:30:34] They could declare a god of the future,
[1:30:37] but they just couldn't declare the god
[1:30:39] that was present. In other words, they
[1:30:42] couldn't do the works that Jesus said,
[1:30:45] "If you believe on me, the works that I
[1:30:47] do
[1:30:48] &gt;&gt; shall you do also." And they couldn't do
[1:30:51] those works. So they couldn't declare a
[1:30:54] present God. So God just become a god of
[1:30:57] history and a god of future. And until
[1:31:00] this age, it looked as if the power had
[1:31:04] completely gone out of the whole church.
[1:31:06] Looked like it had left the church. The
[1:31:08] God of Abraham, you remember when he
[1:31:10] went up and he took his son, took him up
[1:31:13] on a altar and remember what God told
[1:31:16] him to go lay him down on an altar and
[1:31:17] sacrifice him to the Lord. and he
[1:31:20] followed he followed the the word of the
[1:31:22] Lord and he went up in there and tried
[1:31:24] to follow what God had told him to do
[1:31:27] and
[1:31:28] and when he got there and was willing
[1:31:31] then God created a ram in a thicket.
[1:31:34] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:31:36] &gt;&gt; Jehovah Gyra. Yes, sir.
[1:31:37] &gt;&gt; A provider.
[1:31:38] &gt;&gt; That God provided a ram in a thicket. He
[1:31:40] was a creator. Say, where did the ram
[1:31:42] come from? Well, the ram wasn't there.
[1:31:43] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:31:44] &gt;&gt; It wasn't there. It didn't just walk up
[1:31:45] the mountain. God created it.
[1:31:47] &gt;&gt; He's the same God that made the ram in
[1:31:49] the beginning. You know, in the in the
[1:31:50] garden when there was no ram,
[1:31:52] &gt;&gt; come on.
[1:31:52] &gt;&gt; And God said, "Let there be a ram."
[1:31:56] &gt;&gt; And then he waited on Adam to name it.
[1:31:58] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:31:59] &gt;&gt; That same God, he stood there and when
[1:32:01] Abraham would take the knife to take his
[1:32:03] own son's life, God said, "Let there be
[1:32:05] a ram." And that creator God created a
[1:32:07] realm in the thicket of that that same
[1:32:09] God of Abraham, the one that was
[1:32:11] standing on the riverbank
[1:32:14] that when they threw their net into the
[1:32:16] water and there were no fish in the
[1:32:19] water cuz they fished those waters. I
[1:32:21] don't know if you ever fished a fishing
[1:32:22] hole and after a tournament or something
[1:32:24] and one of your buddies say that hole's
[1:32:26] been fished out. You ever heard that
[1:32:27] term? It's been fished out. Other words,
[1:32:29] they wore it out. There ain't no fish
[1:32:31] left in it. They fish these waters all
[1:32:33] night. But when he threw the net in in
[1:32:35] one cast,
[1:32:37] &gt;&gt; the creator that made the realm put 153
[1:32:40] fish in his net.
[1:32:42] &gt;&gt; He's God the creator.
[1:32:43] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:32:44] &gt;&gt; And while he was on the earth, he
[1:32:46] performed. But you see, it looked like
[1:32:48] that was gone until a few years later
[1:32:53] and a prophet of God was walking in the
[1:32:55] woods and he was hunting squirrels and
[1:32:57] God began to speak to him and he told
[1:32:59] him when there wasn't no squirrels out
[1:33:00] there, he said that you have the power
[1:33:02] of the spoken word. You speak it and
[1:33:03] I'll I'll I'll perform it. And he looked
[1:33:06] up there at a tree limb. He said, "Let
[1:33:07] there be a squirrel." He said, "As soon
[1:33:09] as I let them words out of my mouth, the
[1:33:10] squirrel appeared. Let there be a
[1:33:12] squirrel." And there was another one.
[1:33:13] Let there be a squirrel. And there was
[1:33:14] another one. You say, "I find that hard
[1:33:16] to believe." Well, how can you believe a
[1:33:17] ram was made in a thicket? How can you
[1:33:19] believe fish was put into a net of a
[1:33:21] fisherman's boat if you can't believe
[1:33:22] that God couldn't put three squirrels on
[1:33:24] a limb? But what was it? It was a
[1:33:27] revelation of the resurrected power of
[1:33:30] Jesus Christ manifested in the hour that
[1:33:32] we live in. And it was vindicated in the
[1:33:35] house of Hadira when a prophet of God
[1:33:38] went down to her house and he started
[1:33:39] testifying of what God had done. And she
[1:33:42] said, "That ain't nothing but the
[1:33:43] truth."
[1:33:44] &gt;&gt; And her boy sitting there making fun and
[1:33:46] mocking and laughing about it. And he
[1:33:48] said, "Anything you ask for, it'll be
[1:33:50] given to you." Because of her response
[1:33:52] to the word of God, he said, she said,
[1:33:54] "I believe it." He said, "Whatever you
[1:33:56] ask, it'll be given to you." She looked
[1:33:57] at her snickering children. She said, "I
[1:33:59] don't want anything but the salvation of
[1:34:02] my two sons."
[1:34:04] &gt;&gt; And those that were there said, "Them
[1:34:05] boys left where they were and they fell
[1:34:08] down on their face in front of their
[1:34:09] mother and they gave their heart to
[1:34:11] God."
[1:34:13] &gt;&gt; And friends, I got news for you. I don't
[1:34:14] care what anybody says happened to their
[1:34:16] life after that or what they did when
[1:34:18] they was 40 and 50 years old. It don't
[1:34:20] matter one thing. It ain't got one thing
[1:34:23] to do with predestination. If God said
[1:34:25] they belong to her, they belong to her.
[1:34:27] And my God ain't a liar. And when she
[1:34:30] stands over on the other side, them two
[1:34:32] boys will be standing right beside her
[1:34:34] because God gave them to her when she
[1:34:36] asked God for it.
[1:34:38] &gt;&gt; He said, "Whatever you say, it'll be
[1:34:40] given to you." And brother Bam took that
[1:34:42] same voice. This voice, it wasn't to be
[1:34:44] sted in a prophet. It was to be taken in
[1:34:46] the mouth of the bride of Jesus Christ
[1:34:49] &gt;&gt; that has a revelation of the power of
[1:34:51] his resurrection that could speak the
[1:34:53] word of God over situations and watch
[1:34:55] God change lives.
[1:34:58] &gt;&gt; That's the power that God
[1:34:59] &gt;&gt; has brought to your life.
[1:35:02] &gt;&gt; You're not a bunch of nobodies. You're
[1:35:04] not a bunch of ash heap dwellers.
[1:35:06] &gt;&gt; You're sons and daughters of God that
[1:35:08] have the power of the resurrection of
[1:35:10] Jesus Christ in you.
[1:35:12] &gt;&gt; Amen. And when you speak, you speak it
[1:35:15] like it's God speaking it.
[1:35:17] &gt;&gt; And then look for it to happen.
[1:35:20] &gt;&gt; How many believe that tonight?
[1:35:22] Hallelujah.
[1:35:25] &gt;&gt; Oh, when I think about the Lord,
[1:35:30] how he saved me, how he raised me, how
[1:35:35] he filled me with the Holy Ghost, how he
[1:35:40] healed me to the uttermost. And when I
[1:35:44] think about the Lord,
[1:35:48] how he picked me up, turn me around, how
[1:35:53] he placed my feet
[1:35:56] on solid ground. Can you say, "When I
[1:35:59] think about the Lord,
[1:36:01] when I think about the Lord,
[1:36:05] I wonder if that's what Peter was
[1:36:06] singing. How he raised me, how he filled
[1:36:11] me with the Holy Ghost, how he healed me
[1:36:16] to the uttermost. And when I think about
[1:36:20] the Lord,
[1:36:22] how you pick me up, turn me around, how
[1:36:27] you place my feet
[1:36:30] on solid ground,
[1:36:33] it makes me want to shine.
[1:36:37] [Applause]
[1:36:38] Thank you, Jesus.
[1:36:42] [Applause]
[1:36:45] All the honor, all the praise.
[1:36:50] Sing all the shout.
[1:36:53] Hallelujah.
[1:36:54] Thank you, Jesus.
[1:36:56] &gt;&gt; Lord, you're worthy of all the glory,
[1:37:01] all the honor, all of my praise.
[1:37:06] Oh, when I think about the Lord,
[1:37:11] how you saved me, how you raised me, how
[1:37:16] you filled me with the Holy Ghost, how
[1:37:20] you heal me to the uttermost. And when I
[1:37:24] think about the Lord,
[1:37:27] &gt;&gt; how you pick me up and turn me around,
[1:37:31] how you place my feet
[1:37:35] on solid ground.
[1:37:38] It makes me want to shout, "Hallelujah.
[1:37:43] Thank you, Jesus. Lord, you're worthy of
[1:37:47] all the glory,
[1:37:49] all the honor, all of my praise.
[1:37:53] It makes me want to shout
[1:37:57] hallelujah.
[1:37:59] Thank you, Jesus. Lord, you're worthy of
[1:38:03] all the glory,
[1:38:05] all the honor, all of my praise.
[1:38:09] It makes me want to shout.
[1:38:13] Hallelujah.
[1:38:14] Thank you, Jesus.
[1:38:17] Lord, you're worthy of all the glory.
[1:38:22] It's all of my praise. Well, it makes me
[1:38:26] want to shout.
[1:38:29] Hallelujah.
[1:38:30] &gt;&gt; Thank you, Jesus.
[1:38:31] &gt;&gt; Well, thank you, Jesus.
[1:38:36] &gt;&gt; Oh, all the honor, all of my praise.
[1:38:42] Amen. Won't you give the Lord a hand
[1:38:43] clap of praises?
[1:38:48] Amen. Let me tell you this. We're not
[1:38:50] feeding on a man. We're feeding on the
[1:38:51] revelation of the hour.
[1:38:53] &gt;&gt; How many's feasting on the revelation of
[1:38:57] a resurrected savior?
[1:38:59] &gt;&gt; Amen. Isn't that powerful to have
[1:39:02] something to feed on in this hour? We
[1:39:03] ain't got no dead god, but the word body
[1:39:07] of the son of man. We've got a real word
[1:39:09] to feed on. It gives life to the eater.
[1:39:13] &gt;&gt; And the more you eat on it, the the
[1:39:15] better you are and the more strength you
[1:39:17] have.
[1:39:18] &gt;&gt; Isn't that something? you come into
[1:39:19] church, how many how many feels better
[1:39:21] than you did when you came in? Isn't
[1:39:23] that what isn't that wonderful? Just
[1:39:25] being in the presence of the Lord.
[1:39:27] That's our desires. Let the revelations
[1:39:30] of God be open to us.

[1:41:10] make it right.

[1:41:26] night.

[1:41:29] Lord, I've seen a world that's dying.
[1:41:34] Wounded by the master of the sea.
[1:41:40] They're all groping in the darkness,
[1:41:45] haunted by the years of past defeat.
[1:41:51] But then I see his face. What a
[1:41:54] revelation.
[1:41:56] &gt;&gt; Shining with compassion in your eyes.
[1:42:01] [Applause]

[1:43:39] &gt;&gt; cuz he has given us ears to hear and
[1:43:42] eyes to see this word for this hour.
[1:43:45] Amen. We should be so excited when we
[1:43:48] come into the house of God because he's
[1:43:51] given it unto us. Amen.
[1:43:54] We're going to go forward from this day
[1:43:57] climbing higher and higher. We're not
[1:44:00] going to settle for nothing less. We've
[1:44:02] been given the true word of God for the
[1:44:04] hour. Let's be excited about it and
[1:44:07] feast upon it. Grow in it. Become what
[1:44:11] he's called us to become. Amen.
[1:44:14] Let's raise our heads to him and our
[1:44:17] hands to him and give him all that we
[1:44:20] are.
[1:44:22] Just yield yourself to him because he
[1:44:25] wants to manifest himself in our life.
[1:44:29] Amen. He wants all of us, not part of
[1:44:32] us. All of us. Every bit of you, he
[1:44:36] wants for his glory. Amen. So just give
[1:44:39] it to him. Amen.
[1:44:42] Gracious heavenly father, Lord, we come
[1:44:44] before you. Lord, you sent your word
[1:44:47] unto us, Lord. Father, through the power
[1:44:50] of your word, Lord Jesus, you've
[1:44:52] transformed our minds, Lord. We no
[1:44:55] longer look at the things that once was,
[1:44:57] Lord, but we look forward to the things
[1:44:59] that shall be and the things that are
[1:45:02] now, Lord. Father God, you've intowed us
[1:45:05] with power of your word, with authority
[1:45:07] of your word. Lord, if we could just
[1:45:10] recognize the revelation that lays
[1:45:12] before us, Lord, how we will walk
[1:45:15] victorious in you, Father, every where
[1:45:19] our feet will tread, Lord, is for your
[1:45:22] glory, Lord. Father God, that we become
[1:45:25] a true witness for your word, Lord God,
[1:45:28] that your word be living in us, Lord
[1:45:30] Jesus. Father God, that we would not
[1:45:33] take the backseat to the devil's lies,
[1:45:35] but we would stand forward on thus
[1:45:38] sayaith the word of God. Lord, bring our
[1:45:41] hearts, Lord, so close to you, so close
[1:45:44] together, Lord, that Father, when the
[1:45:47] enemy comes in like a flood, we will
[1:45:49] stand together upon your word and do
[1:45:52] battle one for another, Lord. Father,
[1:45:55] you're the tie that binds us, Lord.
[1:45:58] Father, take away, Lord Jesus,
[1:46:00] everything, Lord God, that we could have
[1:46:03] in our hearts toward one another, Lord.
[1:46:05] Father, let people take inventory of
[1:46:07] their lives, Father, if there's an ought
[1:46:10] against this one or an ought against
[1:46:11] that one, Lord. Father, that we would go
[1:46:14] to one another, Lord, we don't want to
[1:46:17] hold back, Lord, what you're trying to
[1:46:19] push forward. So I'm asking you Lord,
[1:46:22] you've brought your word, Lord. And I
[1:46:24] pray that each one of us applies it to
[1:46:26] our life for your glory, Lord. It's
[1:46:30] nothing that we can do, but it's what
[1:46:32] you have already done, Lord. So I'm
[1:46:34] asking you, Father, Lord, and for the
[1:46:37] meetings coming up, Lord, in Manchester,
[1:46:40] Tennessee at Hardy, Lord, Father, that a
[1:46:43] great outpouring of your Holy Ghost
[1:46:45] would come down upon the people, Lord.
[1:46:47] that every need would be met, Lord
[1:46:49] Jesus. Lord, for anyone, Lord, that has
[1:46:52] not surrendered their lives to you,
[1:46:54] Lord. That they would find Calvary,
[1:46:57] Lord. Father, that they would find the
[1:46:59] rest that they're looking for. Lord,
[1:47:02] that the thirst that they're craving,
[1:47:03] Lord, would be quenched, Lord. Father,
[1:47:06] I'm asking you, Lord, not our will to be
[1:47:09] done, but your will, Lord. Father, we
[1:47:11] ask you, Lord. Father, when we leave
[1:47:14] this place, Lord, please don't leave us,
[1:47:16] Lord, or we leave you, but Lord, there
[1:47:18] would be a fire kindled in us, Lord
[1:47:21] Jesus. That very revival, Lord, bubbling
[1:47:24] up inside us, Lord Jesus, that would
[1:47:27] make us hunger and thirst after your
[1:47:29] word. Lord, I ask these things in your
[1:47:31] name, Jesus Christ. Lord, we praise you,
[1:47:34] Lord, in Jesus Christ's name. Amen.
[1:47:38] Amen.
[1:47:39] [Music]
[1:47:41] Amen. You can take this whole world,
[1:47:45] but give me Jesus.
[1:47:49] Take this whole world,
[1:47:52] but give me Jesus.
[1:47:56] You can take this whole world,
[1:47:59] but give me Jesus.
[1:48:02] I won't turn back. I won't turn back.
[1:48:06] &gt;&gt; I won't turn. Amen. Just remember our
[1:48:09] services at home Sunday. Brother Joe be
[1:48:11] speaking for us at homes.
[1:48:16] Oh, you can take this whole world,
[1:48:20] but give me Jesus.
[1:48:23] You can take this whole world,
[1:48:27] but give me Jesus.
[1:48:31] I won't turn back. I won't turn back.
[1:48:34] &gt;&gt; I won't turn back.
[1:48:38] Well, I have decided
[1:48:42] to follow Jesus.
[1:48:45] I have decided
[1:48:48] to follow Jesus.
[1:48:52] I have decided
[1:48:56] to follow Jesus.
[1:48:59] I won't turn back.
[1:49:01] &gt;&gt; I won't turn back.
[1:49:03] &gt;&gt; I won't turn back.
[1:49:06] So keep on pressing.
