good is because it's true he is god our healer he is god our deliverer he is god our savior he's the same yesterday today and forever how sad it is our nation has forgotten what this nation was founded on when she was in her infancy she served god her principles our constitution was wrote upon god's principles and god's word but now i guess she's got just a little bit too big thinks you don't need god no more but i'm so glad that there's still a people in this nation who still needs god amen amen you know they think they don't want us around they think they don't want these christians around anymore these jesus loving people but one day when we're gone they wish we were back amen what a privilege it is friends that we are now feasting off the revealed word of the arab that will literally change our bodies you know the bible says that enoch that he was not because god took him that before his translation he had this testimony that he pleased god god took him off the earth because he pleased god and how do we please god the prophet said we please god by keeping his word and he has come in this hour and revealed unto us his word what it takes to please him amen you know he never asked for our money he never asked for our education he never asked for our ability he just wanted our hearts the only thing he ever said was if thousand believe what a privilege it is to serve him this morning kind of an honor to be with you once again we always enjoy coming down through arkansas way and many many years ago as a young minister i come up through this area used to preach up in a place called camp up above mama springs there used to live there and drive all night to get home work the next day good times in the lord kids it's good to see some of familiar faces still pressing on still serving the lord i look forward to the time that it's all said and done we'll be more traveling a little more battles a bit more sickness a bit more heartache no pain we'll gather around daddy's table you talk about a thanksgiving dinner that'll be a real thanksgiving dinner prince amen no matter what you do don't miss it there is nothing in this nation worth missing that gathering over you young people ain't nothing wrong getting a good job ain't nothing wrong having an education but you can have all that but if you don't have jesus it'll rot one day but you can have jesus be the poorest man in arkansas but you can lay down at night and know that you're rich in the mercy of the almighty god that when there is no more world we'll still be serving him amen god bless you richly appreciate brother matt letting this come if you have your bibles this morning turn with us to the book of luke i want to read from luke chapter 17 starting at verse 11. we greet you in the name of the lord jesus and we count this will be a trusted to be a blessing to you this morning and i know we got some good food coming after a while and i'm glad it's somewhere else so we don't have to smell it i remember one time i was in the meat and man i tell you they was cooking out there getting ready to have a big meal after the service and the aroma started coming into the church lost every one of them right there you know amen so we're gonna be some good food so make sure you stay around for that this afternoon we kind of an honor to be here send you greetings my pastor brother donny reagan from my family my wife was wanting to come but i had a little a nephew and his wife was having a baby shower and so she felt like she needed to be there with the family and so she's so sorry she couldn't be here but luke chapter 17 verse 11. i appreciate each one coming out this morning the bible says this luke 17 11 and it came to pass as he went to jerusalem that he passed through the midst of samaria and galilee and as he entered into a certain village there met him ten men that were leopards which stood afar off and they lifted up their voices and said jesus master have mercy on us and when he saw them he said unto them go show yourself unto the priest and it came to pass that as they went they were cleansed and one of them when he saw that he was healed he turned back and with a loud voice glorified god and he fell down on his face at his feet giving him thanks and he was a samaritan and jesus answering he said well there are not ten cleansed but where are the nine they are not found that return to give glory to god save this stranger and he said unto him arise and go thy way thy faith have made thee whole let's bow our heads i want to speak to you for a few minutes this morning on give him thanks heavenly father how we love you today lord and we are so grateful that you are our god and beside thee there is none other and lord it is with thanksgiving in our hearts that we bow our heads to the dust from which you brought us lord knowing dear god that no matter what we face in this life lord we do not face it alone for you promised us in your word you would never leave us nor forsake us and lord as we have gathered here this day lord and set aside this sunday for a fellowship dinner of thanksgiving lord oh god we want to thank you for all that you've done for us lord for while i was yet a sinner you died for me and lord we asked your blessings upon our precious brother matt lord and his family dear god and this congregation and lord we ask that signs and wonders would be brought at the hands of the believers that this area would know that thou art god lord we pray today for those in need her brothers and our sisters lord who are hurting because they've lost loved ones to this pandemic lord may you comfort their hearts and those dear god that are sick and afflicted may you heal them lord and father those that would be nervous and may be weary of all that's happening god and the oppression may you come and lift him up today lord that there would be thanksgiving upon their lips because you are our god our healer and our deliverer lord we ask you god that you would take this congregation and myself lord and this this simple little broke up thought oh god may you bless us today lord we pray and we'll be careful lord to give you praise and honor and glory for we ask these things in jesus name and the bride says i mean god bless you saints you may be seated you know brother matt was telling us that after church today that we're going to have a thanksgiving dinner for the for the church and i was thinking about that and as i was thinking about thanksgiving you know we're getting close to that time and it's a shame you know that because of commercialism and because of profit that they just overrun thanksgiving and already putting up christmas stuff which it's kind of sad because really thanksgiving is truly the only protestant holiday that there is all other holidays is by the catholic church if you'll study it you'll find that to be true and so i was thinking along these lines and and i got to thinking about all that i have and i was sitting in the hotel room last night and i got to thinking about all that god has done for me and all that we've got to be thankful for and so i thought i'm just going to go to the pulpit today and i just want to say thank you lord i just want to give you thanks for the bible says in psalm 69 i will praise the name of our god with a song and i will magnify him with thanksgiving so i want to magnify his name today with thanksgiving in my heart i want to lift my voice in the midst of the congregation and i want to say thank you lord for all that you've done for me i want to thank you for his goodness i want to thank him for his faithfulness i want to thank you for his mercy i want to thank you for his love i want to thank you for his long suffering i want to thank you for his forgiveness you know when you begin to think about all that he's done for us we begin to realize that there's not enough hours in the day to really thank our god we could never thank him enough amen the bible says in the book of psalms know you that the lord he is god it is he that has made us and not we ourselves we are his people well that's enough to be thankful for we are his people and the sheep of his pastor enter into his gates with thanksgiving and enter his courts with praise be thankful unto him and bless his name in our scripture reading we find that the lord is coming to this village and as he enters in they are these ten leopards who are standing afar off now these leopards they were marked men to be a leopard was to be an outcast it was to be rejected it was a death sentence separation from family separation from friends separation from the village you were shunned and when they went into the village they had to cry out unclean unclean to give everybody a warning don't get around me so they were standing afar off because of their condition but i'm so thankful this morning that when others would shun us when they say that we were hopeless case that we were too far gone i am so glad and so faithful that we have a god that will come to us [Applause] who will still stand still for the biggest drunk in arkansas for the biggest come on somebody for the biggest prostitute in arkansas we serve a god who'll still stand still when someone will cry out oh my crying out for deliverance for restoration regardless of our situation he will still hear our hearts cry so these tens standing up far off they begin to cry unto jesus saying master have mercy upon us and jesus tells them go to the priest and show thyself clean you see he was telling them to fulfill the law of leprosy because according to leviticus chapter 13 the priest would examine you and declare that you were clean they wanted to be clean and he told them obey the law of moses you want your healing you've got to come god's way amen there is a way provided for every one of us amen but you must come god's provided way god is not moved by sensation god is not moved by emotion god will never move on us because of pity but faith moves god [Applause] amen and so they went as they went along their way they become clean the leprosy left them but why because they were obedient to what he told them to do and when they saw that they were clean can you just imagine the joy that all it was is the disease that your fingers would fall off and your nose would fall off and your ears would fall off and all it was from being a contaminated individual that couldn't get around anybody till all at once they're in their skin was like a baby skin can you imagine the joy no more rejection no more separation restored back to the community restored back to the families and when the samaritans saw that he was cleansed i don't know what the other nine went i don't know where they went i i don't know what they did but this one samaritan when he realized he was healed when he realized he was free oh if you could only realize this morning the bible says whom the son hath made free is free indeed amen when he realized he was free he began with a loud voice to praise god you know it's a shame that people can get excited and scream at a ball game and people accept that but you get happy to scream in church and they look at you like you've lost your mind but i don't know about you friends pigskin don't excite me too much basketball don't excite me too much but when i start seeing what god has done for me and my family i start getting excited everywhere i may not care about the volunteers i may not care about the razorbacks but there's one i do care about and that's god's word amen hallelujah he began with a loud voice to praise god and the bible said he fell down at his feet and began to thank him you can see his desire to express his thankfulness with a loud voice he fell on his face giving thanks to jesus and jesus says wasn't there 10 wasn't there 10 that needed a miracle wasn't there 10 that needed to be free wasn't there 10 that i touched was there not 10 where are the other nine oh god don't let me be that way if god has done something for me god give me the courage to testify that were the other nine healed yes i believe they were did they lose their healing no i don't believe they did they were still healed he never took their healing away from him you know because the bible says in luke 6 35 but love ye your enemies and do good and lend hoping for nothing again and your rewards shall be great and you shall be the children of the highest for he is kind to the unfaithful and to the evil he is kind to the unthankful that's the kind of god that we serve he is kind to even those that are thankful that was 10 healed but only one turned back to say thank you [Music] where was the gratitude of the other nine and i was thinking about that and i thought if that's not the attitude of this nation today unfaithful ungrateful the bible says in second timothy 3 this know also that in the last days pearlesce time shall come for men shall be lovers of their own selves you know like selfies lovers of their own self covetous boasters proud blasphemers disobedient to parents unthankful unholy without natural affection honey that's not something that's coming it's here now amen truth breakers false accusers incontinent means they have no control fairest despisers of those that are good trendy uh traitors heavy high-minded lovers of pleasure more than lovers of god having a form of godliness but denying the power thereof from such turn away this is the hour that we're living here a generation of unthankful people you hardly see anybody bowing their heads and thanksgiving for their food anymore you go to a restaurant you hardly see anybody that'll pray over their food but let me tell you something brother sister do not be ashamed to bow your head because one day you'll never know you'll never realize how many times that prayer before you ate kept you from food poisoning [Applause] hallelujah let them laugh at us let them call us what they want to call us i want to bow my head and thank my god amen [Applause] amen brother branham said you sit down at a table he said never eat never eat without thanking him for it i see many people call themselves christians and yet they never return thanks just as illiterate as a hog under an apple tree a hall could sit on an apple tree and they eat apples all day long and those apples will beat him on the head and he'll eat till he can't grunt no more the prophet said but he'll never look up to see where they're coming from oh my just like thanksgiving day many people today never thought the prophet said tens of thousands times thousands and millions of americans eat dinner today in a thanksgiving celebration with a turkey on the table and never as much offer a blessing or return of faith a nation of ungrateful unholy unthankful but oh god i don't want to be like that i don't want to be ungrateful i don't want to be unthankful i don't want his blessings to become common to me i want to thank him i want him to know that i appreciate it the bible says in hebrews 13 by him therefore let us offer the sacrifice of praise to god continually that is the fruit of our lips giving thanks to his name how often continually thanking god for his blessings and his goodness of life so i want to come this morning and just take a little bit of time to thank him amen and there's just just a few things i could sit down and brother matt could get up and he could sit down and brother mark could get up and he could sit down and brother david could get up and he could sit down and sister so-and-so could get up and on and on and on and come into the night and the next day or the next day and never get done thanking him for the blessings he's given to our lives but just for a few minutes just to pull a few things out that i want to thank my god for i want to thank you for salvation but the bible says in romans but god commendeth his love towards us that while we were yet sinners christ died for us much more than being now justified by his blood we shall be saved from wrath through him oh he ill he is our escape door hallelujah he is the god who owns the issues of death and you look at word issue of it means the escape he is the exit door out of this world we shall be saved from the wrath by passing through the exit door for unto him belongs the issues of death david said while i was yet a sinner he sought me out just like he did you just like he did his first son adam in the garden of eden when god had to be true to his holiness and true to his word when even adam had done evil when god himself it wasn't adam he was hiding from god but it was god himself who ran up and down the garden hollering adam adam where art thou adam if somebody wants to know who jesus really is let me ask you something who was it that come hunting for the first lost son who come honey for adam it was not the angels no no no it was god himself god himself come looking for his first lost son and god himself through the skin of a body named jesus came looking forever adam that was ever lost upon the earth don't you see who up looking for you not a preacher not an avenger not a prophet but god himself make flesh amen hallelujah he come looking for me it was god saying adam worked out the same thing today said no man's ever sought god it was always god seeking out us he said where do you get that the bible says no man can come to me unless my father draws him first when we were drunks when we were drug addicts who put up your angels wings we weren't always sitting in church singing holy holy holy but while our lives was in a mess when we thought there was no way out when people turned their head and said there's no hope for that man there's no hope for that woman but god hallelujah i'm so thankful this morning that god never gave up on me he never gave up on you the bible says in isaiah 62 12 they shall call them the holy people the redeemed of the lord and thou shalt be called sought out a city not forsaken the bible said you shall be called the sought out who was looking for you the bible said you shall be called the sought out who was looking for you he was amen when i was lost when i was separated from god he came looking for me do you remember the day do you remember the hour do you remember the time i'll never forget it december the 21st 1981 2 o'clock in the afternoon i've been drunk the night before i had a hangover i was in an old building in a place called jonesburg tennessee and god came down in that building i was there by myself and god came i knew it was god because i felt him when i was a boy and i thought i've got to get out of here and i started crying and i started running around i was five years in the military i was the next veteran up at the 18th airborne court fort bragg trained you know for combat but here i was crying in an empty building and i got to the door and tried to get out the door i was trying to run from what i was feeling and a voice spoke to me and said if you go out that door i'll never call you again and i want to say thank you god for finding me in jonesburg tennessee do you remember the day he found you can somebody say thank you lord for finding me for finding you i want to thank him i want to thank him for his ability to remember amen jeremiah 2 1 says this moreover the word of the lord came into me saying go and cry in the ears of jerusalem saying thus saith the lord i remember thee amen the prophet said the ever remembering god remembers every promise of his word said oh i like to preach on that see god don't forget nothing concerning his word though it looks like sometimes that he does but yet god never forgets a promise he told noah it's going to rain 120 years went by but it rained you know why god said so he told isaiah a virgin shall conceive how long 800 years after he spoke it and god remembered his promise he told moses that israel been there 400 years they had to go up at that time he told abraham his seed would sojourn in a strange land for 400 years then he'd bring them out with a mighty hand he told father abraham your seed will sojourn in a strange land they will afflict them they will beat them they will persecute them but i will deliver them saith the lord go with me for a few minutes to the mud pits of egypt and hear the cry of the people who have been placed in bondage i see an old man stomping the straw into the mud to make brick for pharaoh cities it just seemed like he can't stop stomping amen i can't hardly go i can't hardly make one more stomp into this mud did you hear the crack of a whip and his cry as it strikes his old back and a voice cries out work dog or you'll die in the pit today someone yells out take courage old man cut deliver us and someone yells out how long are we going to hear that i see no deliver around here nothing ever changes someone else says god will remember he will remember his promise so the cry goes up before god and now we hear a different cry it is the cry of a baby and someone says it's a boy it's a boy a hebrew male child that was certain death but somehow his mother knew he was different perhaps it was the light that came into the room the morning he was born she tries to hide him but after three months she can't hide him anymore and knowing that god had delivered noah by a boat or by an ark she builds an ark and places her baby in the bark of this basket and pushes it out into the river and what happens to that basket the hand of god grabs it and begins to direct that basket and he takes it right straight into pharaoh's palace just as pharaoh's daughter who had just lost a child came down to bathe in the water and the basket floated right up to her and she took the lid off it's a baby and she said the gods have given me a baby but you see she had it wrong it wasn't the gods it was the guard and she picked it up and she said i shall call you and she heard a voice no doubt say moses i should call you moses one taken from the water and his sister who followed the basket was in the reeds and she said no i'm going to need you know they didn't have bottles in that day so i'm going to need a wet nurse i'm going to need someone to nurse this baby and marion goes steps right out of the reeds she said your highness my mother immersed that baby what's that you say child my mother she'll nurse that baby oh she take good care of this baby oh yes ma'am she'll treat it just like it was her own [Applause] what was it god's promise was unfolding and 40 years went by and we find down in the mud pits not one thing has changed still stomping out the mud still making bricks for the cities and someone cries out take courage brothers remember the promise someone said where is the promise of our deliverance somebody else yeah maybe he meant spiritual maybe we're already delivered listen friends when god makes a promise we don't need to cut it up squeeze it up to make it fit we don't need to interpret ourselves god doesn't need our help god can keep any promise that he's made he's just looking for somebody who will believe him amen well i know some of you seen the ten commandments you know in that scene where the old man's in there in the pits and he can't stomp no more and you know he starts to rebel and he throws the dagger and stabs him in the side and moses happened to be down there and he jumps into the mud pit and the old man falls into his arms and moses grabs him because he's seen he's been stabbed he said i'm dying an old man god forgot the promise for he told me my eyes would see the deliverer did he realize that the liver was holding him in his arms oh friends sometimes the thing that you desire most is right here in front of you now amen to moses i remember my promise i've come down to make good what i said god doesn't forget amen he doesn't forget his curses neither does he forget his blessings but every promise that god made he will stay with that promise the ever remembering god remembers every promise of his word and his word will not fail us hallelujah god keeps his word he never forgets a promise no matter how long it seems and i want to say this morning thank you lord for remembering the promises of your word hallelujah hallelujah amen i want to thank him this morning because not only is he the god who remembers there are some things that he forgets you see if we have confessed that we have been in his presence and we have confessed our sins they are blotted out of the book of his memory there is nobody that can do that with god now you can do anything to me i'll forgive you but i remember it amen if you do anything to me you you forgive me i forgive you but we can still remember it but god he ain't like us like that but god can forgive and forget think of it this morning he doesn't even remember that you've done it [Applause] though our sins would be a scarlet he has washed them wider than snow and wiped them out of his book of remembrance you may remember that thing that you've done you may remember and you hold it down for years something you made a mistake when you was a young girl and you made a mistake and you've helped that over you for years but let me tell you the moment you confess that god dropped it in the bleach of his blood and god doesn't even remember that you've ever done it and you are free this morning from the condemnation amen it makes me feel good when it's not even remembered nothing can do that but god nothing but god can do that he said he would blot it out of his book of remember i can't do it you can't do it because we've got this little finite senses but he's an infinite god he can absolutely forget that it was ever done hallelujah what's in are you talking about god puts our sins in the sea of forgiveness he blots them out there as though you never did happen oh my then we stand here free by the grace of god through jesus christ there lord pure and holy just as holy as he was because he doesn't see me when i come up there he sees his own son don't you see my brother my sister when we confess those failures god gives him in that bleach god doesn't see the sin he only sees the blood amen amen he sees his own son that's the only way he can see he can't see me because i'm in his son yes sir he only sees his son isn't that wonderful we don't have to think about our sins anymore well you see some people all their life they carry this cloud over them because they have made a mistake but if you can only receive it this morning and you have confessed that thing god doesn't even see it you can go talk to him about it and he don't even know what you're talking about satan said pull matt's book out there look at all those mistakes that matt made but you see matt doesn't confess them put them in the bleach and when god opens up the book it's blank amen you don't have to worry about it anymore it's all out of god's memory he doesn't even remember it you know i was going to lose the inner sister share this testimony with me when she was a young girl she went to a church there in louisiana brother benham came down our shreveport louisiana jack moore's meeting's dinner and given her a prayer line that night and she got on the platform and she told me i was young about 18 year old she said i've been slipping out behind the smoke house smoking nobody knew it my mama didn't know my daddy didn't know my pastor didn't know my brothers and sisters didn't know y'all might think you're getting away with that vaping but there's an all-seeing eye who knows oh well vaping's not worse as nicotine that's a lie of the devil preach brother i think you believe a will she was slipping up behind the smoke house smoking and standing there in the prayer line a man stood before the prophet of god under the anointing of discernment he told him you got to have it in your life it's cigarette smoking there's a pack in your pocket right now and the man said that was true and that sister standing there she said i was 18 year old i was about three people behind i could hear what the prophet said to the man and she said i knew when i stood before him he was gonna tell my mama my daddy my pastor my friends he was gonna tell everybody through discernment that i was smoking she said standing there on that platform i said oh god please forgive me and she said when i stepped before the prophet of god he never even mentioned it do you know why because she confessed it and when she confessed it god dropped it into the bleach and the prophet couldn't even see it hallelujah do you know how long it takes god forgive you you know how long it takes god to forgive you as long as it takes you to ask hallelujah well thank you jesus [Music] i am so thankful this morning that my sins are gone never to be remembered against me anymore i'm free whom the son i've made free it's freezing deep i was just in chief alaska in august eskimo village about about 150 miles off the arctic circle i was there back in august of 19. there's a young girl come to the we had a prayer line that night this young girl come and stood before me she said brother daryl i'm an alcoholic she said i've tried everything to quit drinking she said i've been through the nine step program three different times said i wake up and find myself in places that i shouldn't be in see but i have tried everything to quit drinking she says i can not quit drinking i said sis have you tried jesus i said you just give jesus that alcohol and you take his freedom that he's given you you lay that alcohol down you accept his freedom and go out free and i begin to pray for that girl i'll never forget she began to scream to the top of her lungs i'm free i'm free i'm free and i was just there in august of this year she came up to me she said brother daryl it's been two years i'm still sober [Applause] i want to thank him i want to thank him this morning for being my healer when my daughter was blind but she couldn't have no control over her body but her brain was damaged from an accident the toby should never walk again she'd never speak again she'd never swallow again we'd feed her through her stomach the rest of her life but i'm so glad that he was her healer and today she sees better than me she walks and talks graduated from school with honors why he is our healer and our deliverer this morning psalms 103 says bless the lord o my soul and all that was in me bless his holy name bless the lord o my soul forget not all of his benefits who forgiveth all thine iniquities who healeth all thy diseases who redeem us thy life from destruction peter said in first peter 2 24 who his own self bear our sins in his own body on a tree that we being dead to sin should give should live unto righteousness by whose stripes ye were healed isaiah 53 says surely he has borne our grief and carried our sorrow yet we did esteem him stricken smitten of god afflicted but he was wounded for our transgression he was bruised for our iniquity and the chastisement of our peace was upon him and with his stripes we are healed isaiah 56 says i gave my back to the smiters and my cheeks to them that plucked off the hair i hid not my face from shame and from spit my redeemer my provided lamb amen my healer they took him to pilate's hall they tied him to a whippin post they begin to beat him stripe after stripe and the bible says think of this the bible says for the joy that set before him he endured the cross brother what joy could come from being beaten until they could see your kidneys through the open wounds when great pieces of flesh hung off of his back how could there be joy in such a beating the bible says for the joy that was set before him he endured the cross what was on his mind what was he thinking as they whipped him at the whipping pose he starts a calvary and they throw him down drop the nails into his hands and his feet what was he thinking of oh god he was thinking of you [Laughter] the bible said there they crucified him the most horrible form of death that could be placed upon a human being but the bible said for the joy that was set before him he endured the afflictions of the cross for the joy how could there be joy because he looked for it in time he was the word he knew all things he saw you well he saw you happy he saw you free he saw you sitting in church he saw you standing on your feet he saw you praising him and loving him and faking him he saw you changed he saw you healed he saw you free he saw you restored he saw you redeemed he saw you and he saw me amen he saw you healed he saw me well he saw me happy he saw me forgiven and i want to thank him this morning because he said i could go free whatsoever you do in word or deed do all in the name of the lord jesus giving thanks to god and the father by him hallelujah i want to thank him this morning for saving my soul thank you lord for making me whole thank you could have just a couple more i want to thank him this morning i'm so very thankful when the world has gone insane honey they ain't going they gone insane when a man don't know whether he's a woman or a man he's lost his mind ain't it crazy that the same ones that tells us to follow the science follow the signs but when it comes to a man or a woman they say well it's up to you whatever you want to be well it gets quieter but that's all right the insane assignment is filled up now it's flooded over into the government look i'm not democrat or republican if you voted you vote you vote the conscience of your heart these good men died we just come through veterans today thank you brother david for your service we just come through veterans day and good men died to give us freedom to vote the consciousness of our heart so you vote however you feel i'm not a democrat or a republican i'm a christian but i tell you what i'm not going to quote the truth because of a political opinion come on amen i want to thank you for revelation that we could sit here this morning in our right mind knowing what's right and what's wrong come on somebody thankful for what he's done for us the great mysterious hand of the living god what greater thing could be how much more privileged people could we be than to have our presence the king of kings the lord of lords we would probably blow whistles and host flags and lay out the carpet and everything for the president of the united states even though you may not agree with him yet you would respect the office that the man helped to honor the mayor or the governor of arkansas if he was to come to your house you'd make him some coffee you'd make him feel welcome sure you would but think of it i'm not talking about the governor of arkansas i'm not talking about the mayor of black rock i am talking about the god almighty who created the heavens and the earth who spewed the stars out of his mouth who there are billions of billions of stars and the bible said that my god knows every star by name amen he comes service after service on a wednesday night sunday morning saturday night special meetings prayer meetings in our home that god who created the heavens and the earth meets with us for he said where two or three are gathered in my name i will be in their midst all he ever asked for was humble hearts surrendered hearts that he might take those humble hearts and reveal to them the good things that he has in store for those who love him we have so much this morning to thank him for the promise of the elijah ministry thank god for the elijah ministry the promise of healing the promise of deliverance family oh god thank god for family for fathers who taught us right for mothers who wasn't afraid to switch us if we did something wrong thank god for pastors that'll labor to give us the truth thank god for fivefold ministry thank god for his blessings that upon our life that we're going to go eat in a few minutes and every bite of food that's on that table was given to us by almighty god bless you that's just just oh we could i could sit down brother man somebody else could get up we could go on and on and on but i want to look at one more this morning before we close because i bet that turkey's getting about right right now i want to look at one more i want to thank him for hearing our prayers you know i'm so glad that our prayers don't have to be fancy because i can't pray a fancy prayer somebody asked me one time said you know a foreign language i said yeah english it's foreign to me i don't know a pronoun from a noun i'm not the sharpest knife in the drawer but i'm so glad that my prayer don't have to be a great day and a thou in the destiny of that that it can be just a simple prayer from the desire of my heart and god will hear us even at the point where a little boy whose parents was killed in a car wreck and he went to live with his uncle and his uncle was mean to him and he wanted to pray for his uncle and the pastor walked in found the boy at the altar not sure what he was doing he got a little bit closer and when he got closer he could hear the boy he was saying the alphabet a b c d what is he doing and when he was over the boy stood up he wiped his tears out of his eyes the pastor said i didn't mean to eavesdrop on you but what was he doing they said pastor i was praying i said praying i said yes sir said my mom and daddy took away from me i'm living with my uncle said he'd been mean to me he said i wanted to pray for him but i didn't know how so i just said a b c d e f and i thought god could take the letters and put the words together and know what's in my heart and i'm so glad brother matthew sometimes i wonder if he even hears the words but if he just sees the sincerity of our hearts how many times when we get there that day when we find out that that prayer before we pull out the driveway help us from a head on collision amen amen the bible said this is the confidence that we have in him if we ask anything according to his will he hears us so i just pulled out a few things from the discernment just to share with you to show you that our god hears your prayers little woman sitting right on the end there

something with you one of my favorite scriptures in the bible is jeremiah 29 11. i know the thoughts toward you saith the lord thoughts of peace are not of evil to give you an expected end it's one of my favorite scriptures in the bible here a few years ago i was in sedona arizona preaching a meeting and i woke up that morning with a migraine headache anybody ever had one you know oh my my head was hurting so bad i was literally sweating it was running off my face and dripping onto my shirt brother dale smith maybe some you know brother dale smith he called me he was doing those meetings with me he said hey you want to get some coffee i said brother dale i am so sick i said i got to preach in just a little bit said would you pray for me i said sure i'll be praying for you a few minutes come and knock at the door brother dale handed me some coffee and prayed for me i put one leg in my britches and had to lay down on the bed get the room to quit spinning so i could put the other leg in and i got up and went to church and i preached the headache kind of went away when service is over there's fellowship and up in flagstaff and i said i'm going to go lay down a little bit i'll come up let's see how come on if we got plenty of food we'll go fellowship so go to the room and lay down and i get up want to get up i'm just going to be honest with you i was homesick i had to see my family i was sick i didn't feel good there's only one place that i wanted to be and that was home so i got in the car and i headed up towards flagstaff up 89a if you ever get out in that part of the country go through there it's beautiful out there and i began to talk to god and i began to whine like a big baby and i said lord do you even know i'm out here am i doing any good maybe i should just go home sit down i'm getting old i was just whining and i saw a sign said scenic view i thought i'd pull in just look at those red rock when i pulled into it this place was all grown up there was cups and trash and hadn't been mowed i thought my goodness and there was a concrete bench there and i got out and i sat down on that bench and i began to pray again and i said god do you even know my name do you even know i'm out here when i got done praying bro mark i looked beside me was a coin and at first i thought it was stuck in the in the concrete but when i touched it it moved and i picked it up and on the coin was this verse jeremiah 1 8 before i formed thee in the womb i knew you and i set you aside for service and i turned it over on the other side it was jeremiah 29 every experience and i said he knows my name and i just want to thank him this morning that in our weakest moments that we can honor a simple prayer from our hearts and our god hears her prayer he said brother daryl i prayed and god ain't answered me that's simply not true he just ain't answered you yet or it wasn't the answer you wanted so you didn't think he answered you but the bible says in jeremiah 33 3 call unto me saith the lord and i will answer thee i'm so glad this morning that he knows our name he knows everything about you he knows the reason you're here this morning he knows the motive that brought you here this morning you didn't surprise god when you walked through the back door before the foundation of the world he knew you would sit here the clothes you would have on the color of your hair the color of your eyes and even your name amen isaiah 45 isaiah spoke of a man by the name of cyrus called his name said exactly what he would do and everything that cyrus would be and all that cyrus would accomplish in his life isaiah spoke it isaiah 45 and if you'll search that out you'll find out that that isaiah spoke that 150 years before cyrus was ever born and god done had his life laid out friends this morning he's got it all in control amen psalms 100 says make a joyful noise unto the lord all ye land serve the lord with gladness come before his presence with singing know ye that the lord he is god it is he that made us and not we ourselves we are his people and the sheep of his pastor under his gates with thanksgiving and into his courts with praise be thankful unto him and bless his name for the lord is good his mercy is everlasting his truth endureth to all generations and let me close with this scripture oh give thanks unto the lord for he is good his mercy
