[39:30] atmosphere.
[39:34] Oh, from that of the world.
[39:37] from that other world. I'm not of this
[39:41] world.
[39:43] Oh, I was expressed into time. I've come
[39:48] from another world.
[39:52] Said to be an in time sign.
[39:56] Oh, I'm only here for a little while to
[40:00] prove it manifest his life from another
[40:04] world.
[40:07] I'm going back to that. Oh, let's sing
[40:10] that ser.
[40:14] I live in another world where I'm
[40:18] influenced to praise.
[40:21] Oh, by my theophony
[40:24] that's been singing to me.
[40:29] There's quickening power
[40:32] that's been rapturing me
[40:36] to a heavenly place.
[40:40] A supernatural atmosphere.
[40:43] [Music]
[40:45] Oh, from that other world.
[40:49] From that other world. Oh, let's all
[40:51] stand the same.
[40:54] Oh, I was expressed into time. I've come
[40:59] from another world.
[41:02] Oh, said to be an end time sign.
[41:07] Yes, I'm only here for a little while to
[41:11] prove and manifest his life from another
[41:16] world.
[41:19] I'm going back. I'm not of this world.
[41:23] I'm not of this world.
[41:27] Yes, I was expressed into time. I've
[41:31] come from another world.
[41:35] Oh, sent to me an end time sound.
[41:40] I'm only here for a little while to
[41:44] prove and manifest his life from another
[41:48] world.
[41:49] [Music]
[41:51] Oh, I'm go. I'll sing it once more now.
[41:55] Oh, I'm not of this world.
[42:00] Oh, I was expressed in
[42:05] [Music]
[42:12] I mean for a little
[42:16] to prove to me the is from another
[42:21] world.
[42:24] Oh yes, I'm going back to that eternal
[42:29] word.
[42:31] How many can say, "Praise the Lord this
[42:32] morning?" Amen. How many can worship the
[42:35] Lord here today? How many can testify
[42:38] you're not of this world? Amen. There's
[42:40] a deep calling to the deep this morning.
[42:43] Amen. My isn't it such an honor to be in
[42:45] his house this morning, to be in his
[42:48] presence together with believers of like
[42:49] precious faith. Amen. We thank the Lord
[42:52] this morning for his mercy and grace and
[42:54] want to say good morning to you all and
[42:56] God bless you. Amen. It is a real honor
[42:58] to be here today to be home and to be
[43:00] speaking to you this morning. Amen. From
[43:02] the from the message of the hour, I tell
[43:04] you. Amen. Isn't it just wonderful to
[43:06] have such a Amen. a church together in
[43:09] this morning to fellowship around the
[43:11] things of God. And amen, you just feel
[43:13] the atmosphere of faith building in the
[43:15] sanctuary today. And there's one thing
[43:17] that we know that whenever believers get
[43:19] together, amen, something good always
[43:21] happens. Amen. There's always miracles
[43:23] takes place and healings take place and
[43:26] deliverance takes place and amen. I just
[43:28] want to Amen. Thank the Lord his this
[43:30] morning for his mercy and grace and do
[43:33] want to greet you this morning. Brother
[43:34] Matt ask us to greet you all this
[43:36] morning for him. I know he's there
[43:37] speaking today in Ohio, brother Wayne's
[43:39] assembly there at True Word Tabernacle.
[43:41] And so I know he desires your prayers
[43:43] and Amen. And I know the Lord will use
[43:45] him there mightily today. And want to
[43:47] say God bless you and welcome to all the
[43:49] visitors here this morning with us. And
[43:51] amen. We sure thank the Lord. Amen. That
[43:53] you would take time out of your
[43:55] schedules to come and and be with us
[43:57] today in the house of the Lord. And
[43:59] Amen. I I just tell you my heart is
[44:01] overjoyed this morning of what the Lord
[44:03] is doing here in our assembly and his
[44:05] grace upon it. And Amen. I was just um I
[44:08] was just stepping out there in the in
[44:10] the foyer before we came in and the
[44:12] young kids getting out of Sunday school
[44:13] and I asked some of them. I said some of
[44:15] the young boys, I said, "What did you
[44:16] all learn this morning?" They said,
[44:17] "Well, we was learned about the
[44:19] prophet." And amen. I know to the world
[44:21] that may sound strange. Amen. But to a
[44:24] believer, my heart just bubbled up on
[44:26] the inside. Amen. You say, "Well, you
[44:28] all are focusing on a man." No, we're
[44:29] focusing on Jesus Christ that has been
[44:32] revealed through the son of man. Amen.
[44:34] this morning before we open the word. I
[44:36] know there's many needs among us. Maybe
[44:37] we could just bow our hearts today for a
[44:39] word of prayer. Amen. I know the Lord is
[44:42] here and maybe you just open your heart
[44:43] this morning and invite him. Heavenly
[44:45] Father, Lord, what a what a warm
[44:48] atmosphere is in the building today.
[44:50] Lord, we're so thankful this morning
[44:52] that you woke us up with a mind to serve
[44:54] you, Father. Lord, we're thankful that
[44:56] you grow you pulled us out of this world
[44:58] and drew us into your presence, dear
[45:00] God. Lord, we're thankful this morning
[45:03] that we have a place together with
[45:05] believers of like precious faith. And
[45:07] Lord, we can lay aside our burdens and
[45:09] we can lay aside the cares of life. And
[45:12] Lord, we can look unto you who is our
[45:14] help, who is our strength, Lord. And
[45:16] Father, I pray this morning as we
[45:18] endeavor to look into your word. Father,
[45:20] I pray that your anointing this morning
[45:22] would so fill this building today, Lord.
[45:25] Father, you see every heart that's here
[45:27] today, every need that's here, every
[45:29] every life that's represented here
[45:31] today. Dear God, we're looking to you
[45:33] this morning. Father, trusting that your
[45:35] mercy and grace would be extended to
[45:37] every life here today. Father, I pray
[45:40] that you would bring us into one mind
[45:42] and one accord today, Lord, that the
[45:44] people would not see me or hear me,
[45:46] Father, but Lord, they would see you and
[45:48] they would hear from you today. Father,
[45:51] I pray for those that are sick in their
[45:52] body this morning. May your divine
[45:54] healing virtues, oh God, may they flow
[45:57] through those sick bodies this morning.
[45:59] Maybe some at home unable to be here
[46:01] listening to the service or will go back
[46:03] and listen to it. I pray this morning,
[46:05] Lord, that the angel of God would pass
[46:07] by that home, Lord. Father, if there
[46:10] would be one that's lost their desire or
[46:11] they're in the valley of decision, Lord,
[46:13] or Lord, they're in this in the stage of
[46:16] bewilderment, dear God, when they when
[46:18] they hear this word this morning, Lord,
[46:20] may you so quicken them, dear God, Lord,
[46:22] that they would rise above the things of
[46:24] this world and climb up into the
[46:26] heavenlies, oh God. Uh, Father, we ask
[46:28] you this morning, Lord, we don't just
[46:30] want to be charged here, but Lord, we
[46:32] want to be changed, dear God. May your
[46:34] may your great transforming power come
[46:36] among us today. Forgive us, oh God, of
[46:39] our failures and our shortcomings, Lord.
[46:41] And Lord, we'll be sure to give thee all
[46:43] the praise, all the honor, and all the
[46:44] glory in the wonderful name of our Lord
[46:47] and Savior Jesus Christ. We pray. And
[46:50] all the believers says,
[46:52] &gt;&gt; "Amen." Amen. God bless you this
[46:54] morning. If you have your Bibles today,
[46:56] while you're standing with us, we want
[46:58] to go to the book of St. John, the 15th
[47:00] chapter. We're going to look in John 15.
[47:02] And then also, we're going to look in 2
[47:04] Corinthians 6. Amen. I do want to say
[47:06] it's really good to have sister Lillian
[47:08] back. God bless you. Amen. Amen. We
[47:11] thank the Lord for his healing touch on
[47:12] our sister and Amen. We we do appreciate
[47:15] all that she Amen. contributes and gives
[47:17] to the assembly here. Amen. It is a
[47:20] special morning for us. Our first time
[47:21] in the house of God as a family of four.
[47:23] And amen. We thank the Lord for his
[47:25] mercy and grace to be here this morning.
[47:27] We've got our new little addition, Haven
[47:29] Grace, there with us. And amen, our
[47:31] little buddy Malachi back there. Amen.
[47:33] And we thank the Lord for his mercy and
[47:35] grace. And do want to thank you all for
[47:37] all your support and all the help and
[47:39] efforts and prayers and everything that
[47:41] you did for us, the food you brought and
[47:43] all the text and prayers. I I tell you
[47:46] um we couldn't have felt more love and
[47:47] support from this assembly and we want
[47:49] to say thank you this morning and we
[47:51] sure love and appreciate appreciate each
[47:52] and every one of you. Amen. Here in the
[47:55] book of St. John the 15th chapter, I
[47:57] want to look here in the 18th verse. You
[48:01] love the Lord this morning.
[48:03] Amen. How many come to have church?
[48:06] &gt;&gt; Amen. The 18th verse. If the world hates
[48:08] you, ye know that it hated me before it
[48:13] hated you. If ye were of the world, then
[48:18] the world would love his own. I like
[48:21] that how it says the world would love
[48:23] his own. But because ye are not of the
[48:28] world, but I have chosen. Somebody say
[48:31] chosen.
[48:32] But I have chosen you out of the world.
[48:38] Therefore, the world hateth you. Amen. I
[48:41] also want to look at the book of 2
[48:43] Corinthians the 6th chapter. Amen. 2
[48:46] Corinthians the 6th chapter. You all
[48:48] give us some grace this morning. I've
[48:49] got a a lot of hay on the fork, a lot of
[48:51] things on my heart. Amen. The Lord has
[48:54] just been dealing with us here the past
[48:55] uh actually the past day. And I pray
[48:57] it'll be a blessing to you. And I had
[48:59] something else totally another direction
[49:01] to go. But I feel the Lord leading us in
[49:03] this direction. In 2 Corinthians the 6th
[49:05] chapter and the 13th verse, he says,
[49:09] "Now for a recompense in the same I
[49:11] speak as unto my children, be ye also
[49:14] enlarged. Now be ye not unequally yolked
[49:17] together with unbelievers." I want you
[49:20] to notice how Paul says this. For what
[49:23] fellowship hath righteousness with
[49:25] unrighteousness?
[49:26] And what communion hath light with
[49:29] darkness? And what concord hath Christ
[49:32] with bil which is the devil? Or what
[49:35] part hath a he that believeth with an
[49:38] infidel? So there's fellowship. There's
[49:40] communion. There's a concord. There's a
[49:42] part. Look in verse 16. And what
[49:45] agreement hath the temple of God with
[49:47] idols. How many knows ye are the temple
[49:49] of the living God? as God has said, I
[49:52] will dwell in them and will walk in
[49:55] them, and I will be their God, and they
[49:58] shall be my people. Now, wherefore come
[50:02] out. Somebody say, "Come out."
[50:04] &gt;&gt; Come out from among them, and be ye
[50:07] separate, saith the Lord, and touch not
[50:10] the unclean thing, and I will receive
[50:14] you, and will be a father unto you, and
[50:18] ye shall be my sons and daughters. I say
[50:20] this morning that's the highest honor of
[50:22] any of our lives this morning is that
[50:25] God would call us his sons and daughters
[50:28] saith the Lord Almighty. Amen. We ask
[50:31] the Lord this morning to bless the
[50:32] reading of his word as you can have your
[50:34] seats here today. Amen. If the Lord
[50:36] would help me this morning from those
[50:38] scriptures, if I would if I would take a
[50:40] title today, I want to speak to you on
[50:42] this. Amen. In this world, not of this
[50:46] world. Amen. in this world, not of this
[50:50] world. In St. John 15:19 from the
[50:52] Amplified Bible, it says, "If you belong
[50:55] to the world, then the world would love
[50:57] you as its own and would treat you with
[51:00] affection, but you are not of the world.
[51:03] You no longer belong to it." Amen. That
[51:07] that does something to my heart. You no
[51:09] longer belong to it. But I have chosen
[51:12] you out of the world. And because of
[51:15] this, the world hates you. I I can say
[51:18] this morning as believers, I I believe
[51:21] that we are growing more weary of this
[51:23] world every day. How many could testify,
[51:26] amen, I'm growing more weary of this
[51:28] world every day? The prophet of God
[51:30] would say in looking to the unseen, I'm
[51:32] so glad that by faith that we can see,
[51:35] amen, afar, the coming of the Lord
[51:38] Jesus. How many can see the coming of
[51:40] the Lord Jesus and making preparations
[51:43] to get out of this old world? See,
[51:46] that's going to be burned sometime with
[51:48] unquenchable fire. I don't know about
[51:51] you, but that moves me this morning that
[51:53] we are not making, Amen, preparations to
[51:56] stay. Amen. But we are making
[51:58] preparations to get out. And I can say
[52:01] this morning that this world is not our
[52:04] home. Amen. Amen. We are pilgrims and we
[52:07] are strangers. Amen. As a matter of
[52:09] fact, this morning we are just passing
[52:11] through. Paul would say in Hebrews
[52:13] 11:13, he said, "These all died in
[52:15] faith, not having received, amen, the
[52:18] promises, but having seen them a far off
[52:20] and were persuaded them and embraced
[52:23] them and confessed." Now, this was their
[52:25] confession that they were strangers and
[52:28] pilgrims on the earth. I love that word
[52:31] stranger. It's an alien from a person or
[52:33] a thing. Amen. It is without the
[52:36] knowledge of without a share in. So they
[52:38] were testifying. Amen. That I have no
[52:41] share. I have no investment. Amen. In
[52:44] this world I'm just passing through.
[52:46] That word pilgrim. It is one who comes
[52:48] from a foreign country into a city.
[52:50] Amen. Or a land to reside there. Amen.
[52:54] By the side of the natives. Amen. Amen.
[52:56] A pilgrim is one who comes into a land.
[52:59] Amen. And they reside there. And they
[53:01] are residing. Amen. by the natives of
[53:04] that land. I say to you this morning,
[53:06] you are not a native, amen, of this
[53:08] world. You are not a native of Leonosa.
[53:11] Amen. But God who is rich in mercy has
[53:14] sent you into this age to reside. Amen.
[53:18] But you are a pilgrim, hence you are a
[53:20] stranger. Amen. You are in reference to
[53:22] heaven as your native country. Amen. You
[53:25] are one who sojourns on this earth.
[53:28] Amen. For they for in verse 14. For they
[53:30] that say such things. Amen. Desire
[53:33] plainly that they seek a country. Amen.
[53:36] And truly if they had been mindful of
[53:38] that country from whence they came out,
[53:41] they might have had, amen, the
[53:43] opportunity to return. Amen. But now
[53:46] they desire a better country that is an
[53:50] heavenly. Wherefore God is not ashamed
[53:52] to be called their God, for he has
[53:55] prepared them, amen, a city. I I think
[53:58] this morning it is a joy to know, amen,
[54:01] that we have come from God and we must
[54:04] go back to God. Amen. The prophet of God
[54:07] would say, "Give me spiritual strength
[54:08] for this great journey." Amen. That's
[54:11] just ahead. Give us all we pilgrims.
[54:13] Amen. We profess that we are pilgrims
[54:15] and strangers. Amen. We are not of this
[54:18] world because we have been called out
[54:21] and we have been separated. Amen. By the
[54:24] Holy Ghost. And now, amen. We walk in a
[54:27] new life. And I just want to say this
[54:29] morning, Amen. Some something has
[54:31] changed in my ear. If we can put it back
[54:33] to where it was, it would be good. Amen.
[54:34] Many times we are expecting people to be
[54:37] certain things. And we're expecting
[54:38] people to do certain things. But I want
[54:40] to say this morning, Amen. Sometimes
[54:43] we're expecting too much of people who
[54:45] simply don't have the Holy Ghost. Amen.
[54:48] Amen. We're expecting them to do this
[54:49] and expecting them to live this way and
[54:52] expecting them to dress and expecting
[54:53] them to talk. And the problem is, Amen.
[54:56] They have not got the Holy Ghost which
[54:58] causes him, Amen, to do those things.
[55:00] You all know that. Amen. A man without
[55:03] the Holy Ghost is a brute beast is what
[55:05] the prophet said. Amen. But a man who
[55:07] has received the Holy Ghost has been
[55:10] called out of this world. Amen. And has
[55:13] been separated and set aside, amen, to
[55:16] be a manifestation of another world.
[55:18] Now, I'll say it to you like this. Amen.
[55:21] Amen. God's children have always, Amen,
[55:24] been considered strangers. and pilgrims.
[55:26] Brother Bren said, "We are like Abraham.
[55:28] We left the world and we are looking for
[55:31] a city whose builder and maker is God."
[55:35] He said, "And we are believing that
[55:37] someday, some glorious day. We shall see
[55:40] that city." He said, "My whole heart's
[55:43] desire is to see that glorious city."
[55:46] Oh, church of the living God. I don't
[55:48] know about you this morning. Amen. But I
[55:50] am eat up with the desire. Amen. To see
[55:53] the city. Amen. That John saw coming
[55:56] down from God out of heaven. I am eat up
[55:59] with the passion this morning. Amen. To
[56:01] see that city that has foundations. I am
[56:05] eat up this morning to see that city
[56:07] where there is no politics, where there
[56:09] is no man-made traditions, where there
[56:11] is no influence of hell. Where Leosa
[56:14] does not control. Listen, I don't know
[56:16] about you this morning, but there's
[56:18] something in my heart that wants to put
[56:20] on my traveling shoes this morning. I
[56:22] want to go see that city. I'm a part of
[56:25] that city. That city is calling to my
[56:28] heart.
[56:30] Yes, sir. In St. John 17, Amen, we read
[56:33] of Christ who is that great intercessor.
[56:35] And you all know that St. John 17, Amen.
[56:38] It is a beautiful scripture wherein
[56:40] Jesus, Amen, actually prayed a prayer
[56:43] for the church. Amen. Now, what he was
[56:45] doing was he was praying, Amen, that the
[56:48] church may be kept pure. In St. John
[56:51] 17:14, he says this in his prayer, I
[56:54] have given them thy word and the world
[56:57] hateth them because they are not of the
[57:00] world even as I am not of the world. He
[57:03] said, I pray not that thou shouldest
[57:06] take them, amen, out of the world, but
[57:09] thou shouldest keep them from the evil.
[57:12] Amen. They are not of the world, even as
[57:14] I, amen, am not of the world. Now watch
[57:18] what he says in verse 17. He says,
[57:20] "Sanctify them." Amen. Through thy word,
[57:24] through thy truth. Amen. Amen. So God
[57:27] sanctifies you. Amen. Through his truth,
[57:30] which is his word. Amen. That word
[57:33] sanctified, it means separated from
[57:36] profane things and dedicated to God.
[57:39] Amen. A life of consecration. Amen. Is
[57:42] verse 18. As thou has sent me into the
[57:44] world, even so have also sent them into
[57:47] the world. and for their sakes I
[57:50] sanctify myself that they also might be
[57:53] sanctified through the truth. Amen. Then
[57:55] I can say to you this morning, amen,
[57:58] that God is not requiring you to do
[58:01] anything different than what Jesus did.
[58:03] The prophet of God come along and said,
[58:05] "See, you are, Amen, a predestinated
[58:09] seed." Amen. Just like Christ was. Amen.
[58:13] Then can I say it this morning? Amen.
[58:15] everywhere the word made flesh in Jesus
[58:18] went. It brought a separation. Amen. He
[58:21] could not go into the synagogue and
[58:24] believe their tradition. He could not go
[58:26] into the city and partake of their
[58:28] customs. He could not go into the world
[58:31] and be like the rest of them because
[58:33] there was a sanctification that had been
[58:35] placed over his life. And I'll say to
[58:37] you this morning, amen, if you confess
[58:39] there's a seed in your soul, then you
[58:42] ought to say, "God, Amen, give me a
[58:44] life." Amen. To back up the confession
[58:47] that there's a seed in my soul. Amen.
[58:49] Wherever I go, let the life I live bring
[58:52] a separation in the atmosphere. Come on.
[58:55] I don't think our boys ought to look
[58:56] like worldly boys. And I don't think our
[58:58] girls ought to look like worldly girls.
[59:00] I don't think our church, Amen, ought to
[59:02] look like the world. I think there ought
[59:04] to be a sanctification on the inside of
[59:07] every believer. That'll cause a
[59:09] separation in the world that we're
[59:11] living in. Yes, sir. I tell you. Amen.
[59:14] The world wants mixers. You all know
[59:16] that. But you know what a prophet said?
[59:18] He said, "God wants separators." Amen. I
[59:21] tell you what a prophet said. He said,
[59:23] "God is a segregationalist."
[59:26] Now, that was a heavy one to say, but
[59:28] it's what a prophet said. And he said,
[59:30] "When you make when you meet God," he
[59:32] said, "It'll make you act ridiculous to
[59:34] the outside world." He said, "Could you
[59:37] imagine Abraham, Amen, telling the
[59:39] people he was going to have a baby?" But
[59:41] Abraham had to separate himself from all
[59:45] unbelief. And that's what God calls to
[59:47] every man or woman. When he meets you
[59:50] and forgives your sins and calls you to
[59:53] be his servant, he expects you, amen, to
[59:56] separate yourself from all unbelief. Now
[1:00:00] listen what a prophet said. He said,
[1:00:02] "Disassociate yourself from all things
[1:00:06] that's ungodly." Now, I know it's an age
[1:00:08] of mixers. It's an age where everything
[1:00:10] is no longer black or white. It's just
[1:00:12] all gray. But a prophet said, "Look not
[1:00:15] at the world." He said, "Come out from
[1:00:18] among the world." Amen. God is a
[1:00:21] segregationalist. He said God called
[1:00:23] Israel out. Somebody say out. Amen. He
[1:00:26] called his people out. He said, "And
[1:00:29] God, amen, don't want his children,
[1:00:32] Amen, mixed up with the world or the
[1:00:35] things of the world." Now,
[1:00:38] &gt;&gt; can we preach this morning? Amen. He
[1:00:40] said he is trying to separate his
[1:00:42] church, amen, from the world. But the
[1:00:45] church wants to go on with the world. He
[1:00:48] said, "But his people is still
[1:00:50] segregated, segregated to him." He said,
[1:00:53] "Who is he, the word?" He said, "Now see
[1:00:56] a real genuine Christian has to be a
[1:01:00] segregationalist." He said, "Separating
[1:01:02] himself from the things of the world and
[1:01:05] everything." Now watch this. And come
[1:01:08] into one purpose. Amen. You've got to
[1:01:11] separate yourself from everything. And
[1:01:13] come into one purpose. And that purpose
[1:01:16] is Jesus Christ. Now, I know this is not
[1:01:19] popular preaching, but it's still the
[1:01:20] message. We don't have many purposes in
[1:01:23] this life. Amen. As a people of God, we
[1:01:27] have one sole purpose. And that sole
[1:01:30] purpose is an eternal purpose. And
[1:01:32] that's the only thing that we as
[1:01:34] believers desire to fulfill. And I want
[1:01:37] you to always remember this. Amen. There
[1:01:39] is a purpose behind separation. If God
[1:01:42] asks you to separate, he's not asking
[1:01:45] you to do that to be mean to you or to
[1:01:47] be unfair to you. But there is a purpose
[1:01:50] of that separation. Listen, separation
[1:01:53] means to separate from something, amen,
[1:01:56] to something. Listen, the prophet of God
[1:01:58] said the first man separated himself,
[1:02:01] amen, was Adam. And he separated himself
[1:02:04] from the word, amen, to go with his
[1:02:06] wife, which, now watch this, which
[1:02:08] questioned whether God would keep his
[1:02:10] word or not. He said, what a perfect
[1:02:13] type of the lukewarm carnal-minded
[1:02:14] believer today. Amen. that still wants
[1:02:17] to cling with that and what their
[1:02:18] tradition says instead of taking what
[1:02:21] the word says. He said the carnal
[1:02:23] believer is separated, amen, from the
[1:02:26] word to the church. The carnal believer
[1:02:29] is separated from the word to the
[1:02:32] church. He said, but look, the second
[1:02:34] Adam was created in the womb of a woman
[1:02:38] and came to the world. He was a Nazerite
[1:02:40] to the word of God. Listen, he was
[1:02:43] separated, amen, from the world to the
[1:02:45] word. The first Adam left the word to go
[1:02:49] with his wife. Amen. The carnal church
[1:02:51] member leaves the word to go with the
[1:02:53] church. But there was another type and
[1:02:56] that was the gene seed of God who would
[1:02:59] separate from the world to go with the
[1:03:01] word. And I wonder, can I get a witness
[1:03:04] this morning? I am not a carnal church
[1:03:06] member. I am not a layout of sin. I am a
[1:03:09] son and a daughter of Almighty God. And
[1:03:12] there is something in my soul that is
[1:03:14] causing me to separate from everything
[1:03:17] that's unlike this word because I have
[1:03:20] come from another world.
[1:03:22] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. I'm not of this world. I'm
[1:03:25] of another world.
[1:03:27] &gt;&gt; Amen. Now, now I did some research
[1:03:29] yesterday and I'm going to take some
[1:03:31] time and read it to you here on the
[1:03:33] difference of in the world but not of
[1:03:35] the world. Is that okay?
[1:03:37] The phrase in the world but not of the
[1:03:40] world is often used in religious or
[1:03:43] spiritual context, especially in
[1:03:46] Christianity. But the world actually
[1:03:48] took that phrase and they actually
[1:03:50] applied more broadly to a philosophical
[1:03:53] idea, philosophical,
[1:03:55] is I'm saying that right? Y'all know me?
[1:03:58] idea about how a person lives within
[1:04:01] society without being completely shaped
[1:04:05] or ruled by it.
[1:04:08] That's pretty good right there. Now,
[1:04:10] here is a breakdown of the difference
[1:04:11] being in the world. It means physically
[1:04:15] existing and actively participating in
[1:04:18] daily life. Now, now that don't mean
[1:04:20] that you're some hermit. Amen. Living
[1:04:22] under a rock somewhere, not paying your
[1:04:24] bills and not working and not educating
[1:04:26] your children.
[1:04:28] Amen. No, that means you're in the
[1:04:30] world. You're existing and actively
[1:04:33] participating in daily life. Now listen,
[1:04:35] you live in society and you have
[1:04:37] relationships, you work, experience
[1:04:40] emotions and interact. You interact with
[1:04:43] culture, politics and economy. It is the
[1:04:46] reality of human life. We are here
[1:04:49] embodied and affected by our
[1:04:51] environment. Example, you go to school
[1:04:54] or work, you use technology. Amen. You
[1:04:57] make money. You deal with social issues.
[1:05:00] You're in the world. You're engaging
[1:05:02] with it. Amen. Now, come on, church.
[1:05:04] This message, amen, did not come to make
[1:05:07] us, Amen, a bunch of crazy people to
[1:05:09] society. Amen. I don't mean to get too
[1:05:12] open here. Amen. But I've seen folks
[1:05:13] around this message get plumbed weird
[1:05:16] with ideas. We're not going to school
[1:05:17] our kids. And Amen. We're not And
[1:05:19] really, that's an influence of an idea
[1:05:21] from 1977 that the Lord was going to
[1:05:24] come. So, there was no need to work.
[1:05:26] there was no need to put up for
[1:05:27] tomorrow. And that's why we got people
[1:05:29] living with hardly anything is because
[1:05:31] they adopted some mindset, amen, that
[1:05:34] were of the message and we don't have to
[1:05:36] do anything, amen, to further our
[1:05:38] families. But I want to say this
[1:05:39] morning, brother Brandham said on the
[1:05:41] day of the rapture, he said I'll be
[1:05:43] planting my potatoes. He said, I'll be
[1:05:45] living my life. And he said if he calls,
[1:05:48] brother David, he said, I'll drop the
[1:05:50] hole and I'll take off. Amen. That's the
[1:05:53] kind of people this message produced is
[1:05:56] people who know their responsibility in
[1:05:59] the hour they're living in. Amen. We are
[1:06:01] in the world. Now, we're not of the
[1:06:04] world. Amen. I love this. Not being of
[1:06:07] the world. It means we're not adopting
[1:06:09] the values or the priorities or the
[1:06:12] mindset of the dominant culture or
[1:06:15] system. I want to say it as plain as I
[1:06:17] know how. Grace Tabernacle refuses to
[1:06:20] adopt the mindsets and the culture and
[1:06:23] the priorities of Leoa. And you parents
[1:06:26] ought to join with me this morning and
[1:06:28] say, "I refuse to let Leosa, Amen,
[1:06:31] migrate my children into their culture,
[1:06:34] into their priorities." We are sons and
[1:06:37] daughters of God before we're anything
[1:06:39] else. We're sons and daughters of God.
[1:06:42] And the house of God ought to have
[1:06:44] priority. and worshiping God ought to
[1:06:47] have priority and prayer ought to have
[1:06:49] priority and enjoying the blessings of
[1:06:52] God ought to have priority.
[1:06:55] [Applause]
[1:06:56] &gt;&gt; You still with me? Amen. It is often
[1:06:59] implied as resisting materialism,
[1:07:03] ego and superficial success or moral
[1:07:07] compromise.
[1:07:09] Well, glory to God. It's about
[1:07:12] maintaining an inner orientation or
[1:07:16] identity that is rooted in something
[1:07:18] higher and then something higher
[1:07:22] spirituality,
[1:07:23] integrity, truth or a sense of the
[1:07:27] divine purpose. Now listen, the example
[1:07:30] of that is you might live in a society
[1:07:33] that promotes greed and we do. You might
[1:07:36] live in a society that promotes status
[1:07:39] and we do. You might live in a society
[1:07:42] that promotes self-interest, and we do.
[1:07:45] But you personally live with compassion,
[1:07:48] humility, and purpose, not letting the
[1:07:51] world's standards define you.
[1:07:54] &gt;&gt; Oh, church of the living God. Amen. I'm
[1:07:57] in the world, but I'm not of the world.
[1:08:00] Amen. The standards of Leosa does not
[1:08:03] define who I am. In the Bible, in St.
[1:08:06] John 17, Amen. Jesus prays for his
[1:08:10] followers saying this, they are not of
[1:08:12] the world just as I am not of the world.
[1:08:15] What Jesus meant was that while his
[1:08:18] followers live in the world, their true
[1:08:21] identity, somebody say true identity and
[1:08:24] allegiance is to God, not to worldly
[1:08:27] systems or corrupt values. I tell you
[1:08:31] folks, that's powerful. Amen. Because
[1:08:33] Leosa is the age of corruption and the
[1:08:36] devil is trying his best, amen, to
[1:08:39] intimidate this bride. Amen. To accept
[1:08:42] his corrupt values and become what he
[1:08:45] defines as a Christian. Oh, but every
[1:08:48] day, Amen. I love this section. It has
[1:08:50] everyday interpretation. It means being
[1:08:52] conscience instead of a conformist.
[1:08:55] Amen. It means being conscience instead
[1:08:58] of a conformist. It means living with
[1:09:01] values and not just following trends.
[1:09:04] Well, glory to God. I could preach there
[1:09:06] for two hours. Amen. We are a people who
[1:09:10] is in the world, but we're not living
[1:09:12] with the trends of the world that we're
[1:09:15] in. We have values. Amen. What are you
[1:09:18] putting your value on? I'll tell you.
[1:09:20] Amen. The only thing value should go on
[1:09:22] is souls. And it ought to be on your
[1:09:24] soul and your family soul.
[1:09:28] &gt;&gt; Amen. I love this. Can I go on? It means
[1:09:30] choosing per choosing purpose over
[1:09:33] popularity. Amen. If you are in the
[1:09:36] world, not of the world, you are
[1:09:38] choosing purpose over popularity. I love
[1:09:42] this. You are choosing depth over
[1:09:44] distraction. Amen. You are choosing
[1:09:47] depth over distraction. Now listen, the
[1:09:50] concept meaning, Amen. in the world is
[1:09:52] engaged in everyday life,
[1:09:56] &gt;&gt; society and human experience. Amen. But
[1:09:59] not of the world. You are not defined by
[1:10:02] materialism.
[1:10:04] You are not defined by ego or cultural
[1:10:07] conditioning. My can I say it to you
[1:10:10] like I believe it. We were not brought
[1:10:12] into this world. Amen. To fit in. We
[1:10:15] were brought here to stand out. And the
[1:10:17] prophet of God said, "The religion of
[1:10:19] Jesus Christ has never been popular and
[1:10:22] it never will be popular because the
[1:10:24] world knows its own. And you're not of
[1:10:28] the world when you become a Christian.
[1:10:31] You're not a man of the world." He says,
[1:10:33] "You are a different person from the
[1:10:35] world." That's why Jesus said, "Amen,
[1:10:38] that no man can serve two masters. For
[1:10:41] either he will hate the one and will
[1:10:44] love the other, or else he will hold to
[1:10:46] the one and will despise the other." He
[1:10:49] says, "Now see, you cannot serve God and
[1:10:52] mammon." Now, amen. I love that word,
[1:10:54] that word serve. It is of those who
[1:10:57] become slaves to some base power. So,
[1:11:00] when you're serving something, you
[1:11:02] become a slave to it. Amen. Now, listen.
[1:11:05] If you're a servant of mammon or a
[1:11:07] servant of this world, then you are a
[1:11:09] servant unto a lower power. Amen. You're
[1:11:12] a servant to a power. Listen. Amen. I've
[1:11:14] seen people, Amen, give their all to the
[1:11:17] devil. And the devil can't heal their
[1:11:18] babies when they're sick. And the devil
[1:11:20] can't pay their bills when they're
[1:11:22] broke. And the devil can't put food on
[1:11:24] the table when there's nothing to eat.
[1:11:26] And the devil can't bring them promises
[1:11:28] and can't give them potential. Amen. But
[1:11:30] they're serving that devil. Brother
[1:11:32] said, "That's what's the matter with
[1:11:33] people today. They don't want to get
[1:11:35] shut off from the world. He said, "Now
[1:11:37] listen, you'll turn on your television
[1:11:38] at night." Amen. To see Mary, Susie, or
[1:11:41] every whatever these plays are and stay
[1:11:43] home from the prayer meeting and then
[1:11:45] wondering why you can't hold on. Amen.
[1:11:48] Wondering why. Oh, preach, brother
[1:11:50] Andrew. Thank you. I believe I will.
[1:11:52] Amen. Wondering why you can't hold on.
[1:11:55] Amen. You're not dead enough.
[1:11:58] &gt;&gt; Well, somebody shout, "Amen. You're not
[1:12:01] dead enough." Amen. I stand in prayer
[1:12:03] lines over this world by the grace of
[1:12:05] God. And I hear it time after time after
[1:12:08] time, "Brother Andrew, I can't get the
[1:12:10] victory. I can't overcome this. I can't
[1:12:12] conquer this." Amen. And I'm screaming
[1:12:14] in my soul. And I I'm not trying to be
[1:12:16] rude, but I just want to tell them, I
[1:12:18] know why. It's because you're eat up
[1:12:20] with the things of the world. Amen.
[1:12:22] You're not willing to bear the reproach,
[1:12:24] Amen, of being called a separationalist.
[1:12:27] You're not willing to bear the reproach
[1:12:29] of being called an oddball. But folks,
[1:12:31] if you're going in the rapture, today's
[1:12:33] a good day to accept the revelation. You
[1:12:36] are an oddball. You were not born to fit
[1:12:39] in. You were born to stand out.
[1:12:43] Yes, sir. Amen. And I'll just say this.
[1:12:45] I pray to God that we as parents, Amen,
[1:12:47] never get to a place that we encourage
[1:12:50] our children into things that is zapping
[1:12:52] the life of God right out of them. Amen.
[1:12:55] I'm just going to preach this morning. I
[1:12:56] feel the Holy Ghost in this building.
[1:12:58] Amen. Either we're of this world or
[1:13:00] we're not of this world. And I'll tell
[1:13:02] you this, I think it's time, amen, to
[1:13:04] apply the token. I think it's time to
[1:13:06] clean up from the pull pit to the back
[1:13:08] door. I think it's time to clean up from
[1:13:10] the bedroom to the kitchen to the living
[1:13:12] room and say, "Lord, either we're
[1:13:14] message believers and we're clean
[1:13:16] living, Holy Ghost fil, sanctified, set
[1:13:19] aside apart, or we're just playing
[1:13:21] church. But as for me in my house, I
[1:13:24] refuse to be a carnal believer. I refuse
[1:13:27] to have such a glorious, wonderful
[1:13:29] message and reduce my life down to
[1:13:32] another social Christian in this age.
[1:13:35] Lord, I feel the pull of another
[1:13:38] dimension and it's calling me to come
[1:13:40] up.
[1:13:41] [Applause]
[1:13:42] Oh, brother Andrew, I want to get there.
[1:13:44] Sometimes you can't just say, "I want to
[1:13:46] get there." You got to fight your way to
[1:13:48] get there.
[1:13:50] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. You can't be living two at one
[1:13:52] time. You got to be dead to the world
[1:13:54] and alive in God.
[1:13:57] or either you're a lie to the world and
[1:13:59] dead to God.
[1:14:00] &gt;&gt; Now folks, we can sugarcoat it, but
[1:14:02] somewhere or another we got to take the
[1:14:03] wrapper off in the sugar coat and just
[1:14:05] say it.
[1:14:08] &gt;&gt; And then when you let the world creep in
[1:14:11] and intellectual faith has accepted such
[1:14:13] a thing as that, and you know no more
[1:14:15] about God than a rabbit knows about
[1:14:18] snowshoes. Now, I'll just say this. God
[1:14:20] separated the church and the world. God
[1:14:23] separated. Jesus's prayer in St. John 17
[1:14:26] was a prayer of separation. Listen, the
[1:14:30] church does not belong in the world. Can
[1:14:33] I say that to you? The church does not
[1:14:35] belong in the world. And I'm going to go
[1:14:37] on and say it. And the world don't
[1:14:40] belong in the church.
[1:14:42] &gt;&gt; Brother Re said, I believe that God's
[1:14:44] church is an example to the world, not
[1:14:47] of the world. Amen. I believe God's
[1:14:49] church is an example to the world that
[1:14:52] we can live different, we can act
[1:14:54] different, and we can be different.
[1:14:56] Don't y'all thank God for a prophet? And
[1:14:58] then y'all, how many's ever heard him
[1:15:00] preach on tape? Let me see your hands.
[1:15:01] Amen. You know when brother Abraham
[1:15:03] starts preaching and he gets down that
[1:15:04] clothesline religion and he starts, you
[1:15:07] feel it. It starts getting a little
[1:15:08] tight and he starts saying, "Well, you
[1:15:10] shouldn't dress like this and shouldn't
[1:15:11] look like that." And he said, "Oh, here
[1:15:13] they come." Well, brother Brandon, they
[1:15:14] don't make clothes like that no more. He
[1:15:17] said, "Well, they still sell goods and
[1:15:19] they still sell sewing machines." Amen.
[1:15:22] I'll just go ahead and preach. Amen.
[1:15:23] Sometimes we get a little too caught up
[1:15:25] in fashion and start making fun of
[1:15:27] people because of the clothes they're
[1:15:28] wearing. Amen. I don't care if they do
[1:15:30] look like they stepped out of the
[1:15:32] pioneer days. If they look like a
[1:15:33] daughter of God, we ought to respect the
[1:15:36] value that they desire to look different
[1:15:38] than this world.
[1:15:41] Come on. Amen. Well, he looks like an
[1:15:42] old fog. He looks like an old-timer.
[1:15:44] Well, if he looks like a son of God, we
[1:15:46] ought to say, "Thank God." There's still
[1:15:48] some young men in this evil age that
[1:15:50] still desires, Amen. to look like God
[1:15:53] wants a boy to look like. Well, glory to
[1:15:56] God. Preach, preacher. Thank you. I
[1:15:58] believe I will. I think it's time to
[1:16:00] come back to an oldfashioned holiness
[1:16:02] where we separate ourselves and we look
[1:16:04] like sons of God and daughters of God. I
[1:16:07] tell you what the prophet said. He said,
[1:16:08] "You ever get the Holy Ghost, Sister
[1:16:10] Joyce, it'll make you talk right. It'll
[1:16:12] make you walk right. It'll make you act
[1:16:14] right. It'll make you live right. It'll
[1:16:16] make you spit right. It'll make you die
[1:16:18] right. And one of these mornings, it'll
[1:16:20] make you raised in the power of the
[1:16:23] resurrection because you are not of this
[1:16:26] world.
[1:16:28] [Applause]
[1:16:29] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. He said, "People, you're not
[1:16:32] of the world. So don't you pattern
[1:16:34] yourself like other people."
[1:16:38] &gt;&gt; Well, if I could look like that, then
[1:16:40] end up in the tribulation. Yeah.
[1:16:42] &gt;&gt; Come on, church.
[1:16:44] &gt;&gt; If I could do that and end up in the
[1:16:45] tribulation, he said, "What we need is a
[1:16:48] cleaning up.
[1:16:50] &gt;&gt; What we need is a washing out.
[1:16:52] &gt;&gt; What we need is a scouring out and a
[1:16:55] sanctifying." Now, how many receives a
[1:16:57] prophetic warning?
[1:16:59] &gt;&gt; This is what Brother Bram said. He said,
[1:17:01] "Let me warn you. Get right with God."
[1:17:04] &gt;&gt; Isn't that pretty straight?
[1:17:06] &gt;&gt; Get acquainted with the heavenly things
[1:17:09] of that spirit.
[1:17:11] that comes down from heaven, where
[1:17:13] holiness stands, where the angels of God
[1:17:16] stand, where Jesus Christ stands at the
[1:17:19] right hand of the majesty and glory and
[1:17:23] holiness and power of God. Now listen,
[1:17:25] listen. You're not an American.
[1:17:29] &gt;&gt; He said, "You're not a Swedish. You're
[1:17:31] not a European. You are a Christian. And
[1:17:35] if you're a Christian, then your spirit
[1:17:37] is from up there. So it makes you live
[1:17:40] holy, want to be holy, want to act like
[1:17:43] Christ, want to act like God. Your whole
[1:17:46] desire is on heaven and not of the
[1:17:49] world. Little children, you're not of
[1:17:51] the world. That's what Jesus prayed for
[1:17:53] us. He said, "And we turn right back
[1:17:55] around and put oursel in worldly hookups
[1:18:00] in there where all kinds of people are
[1:18:02] taken in." Listen, the Holy Ghost, Amen,
[1:18:05] sets you out in a separate place. But
[1:18:08] can I tell you this? Amen. It marks you
[1:18:11] and the Holy Ghost makes you a different
[1:18:13] person. Amen. That's why I think
[1:18:15] sometimes we need to take the pressure
[1:18:17] off of people and just face the fact
[1:18:19] they don't have the Holy Ghost.
[1:18:22] &gt;&gt; I know that's heavy, but I'm in the
[1:18:24] word.
[1:18:25] &gt;&gt; And then there's a time to get saved and
[1:18:27] there's a time to encourage somebody in
[1:18:29] their salvation. And somebody that's not
[1:18:32] saved don't need encouragement. They
[1:18:33] need saving. And then once you get him
[1:18:36] saved, then give him some encouragement.
[1:18:38] Well, glory, it's okay. Amen. Amen. The
[1:18:41] product of God said, "You're clothed
[1:18:42] different. You're dressed different." He
[1:18:44] said, "You don't have to be odd and
[1:18:46] peculiar and collar turned around in a
[1:18:48] long ceremony like no, you don't do
[1:18:50] that." He said, "You dress physically
[1:18:52] like this, but it's the spiritual dress
[1:18:54] that counts. The wedding garment has
[1:18:57] been put on you." Amen. I think any born
[1:19:00] again Christian is kind of an oddball to
[1:19:02] the world because you've been changed.
[1:19:05] Amen. I remember the first time,
[1:19:06] brother, that set in on my heart,
[1:19:08] brother Jared. I was about a 9 10 year
[1:19:10] old boy and there was an old brother
[1:19:12] bless his heart he's gone on the glory
[1:19:14] brother Mour and he was from over in
[1:19:15] South Carolina and he come down there to
[1:19:17] Happy Valley and they give him
[1:19:19] microphone and bless his heart he like
[1:19:20] reminded me of that brother Brand Brand
[1:19:22] talked about said he got up there and
[1:19:23] they had to help him and he said I
[1:19:25] wonder what's wrong with him for even
[1:19:26] putting him up there and sister Nish I
[1:19:28] wondered for a minute amen poor old
[1:19:30] feller he climbed up there and he said
[1:19:33] let me see what I can sing and he
[1:19:34] started singing this song I've been to
[1:19:37] the water and I've been baptized. Amen.
[1:19:40] I've been changed. He started singing it
[1:19:42] and I watched the power of God hit him
[1:19:44] and he danced back and forth across a
[1:19:46] platform and he was saying, "I've been
[1:19:49] changed." Amen. I've been changed. Amen.
[1:19:52] I tell you, you want something to shout
[1:19:53] about? Let the Holy Ghost change you
[1:19:56] from the inside out. And he'll make you
[1:19:58] dance from one side of the bill to the
[1:20:00] other. And all you can say is, "I have
[1:20:03] been to the water and I've been
[1:20:05] baptized. I've been fed. I've been
[1:20:08] sanctified and filled with the Holy
[1:20:10] Ghost and fire. Listen, folks. Amen.
[1:20:13] Heaven lives by the word. That's a
[1:20:16] direct quote. Amen. Heaven lives by the
[1:20:19] word. I don't know about you. I don't
[1:20:20] want to be earthbound. I want to be
[1:20:22] heavenly minded.
[1:20:25] &gt;&gt; I want to be heavenly minded. Now, let
[1:20:27] me just say this to you. A denomination
[1:20:29] is not the separate place.
[1:20:32] Denomination is a lodge.
[1:20:36] It allows you to come unchanged,
[1:20:39] &gt;&gt; but the separate place is the word. He
[1:20:42] said, "Now, see, the church is born
[1:20:43] again, bunch of believers that's in
[1:20:45] Christ by the Holy Ghost, and they're
[1:20:48] led by the spirit of the Lord." Now, I
[1:20:50] believe tonight, folks, this morning
[1:20:52] that this bride is not going to the
[1:20:54] judgment. How many agrees
[1:20:56] &gt;&gt; the bride is not going to the judgment?
[1:20:59] She has already been judged, brother.
[1:21:02] So, may I bring this a point? When we
[1:21:04] are judged by the word, which is Christ,
[1:21:07] he says, we are chastened. And if we're
[1:21:11] doing wrong and we're not living up to
[1:21:13] the world, hey, the word, we're chasened
[1:21:15] to the Lord. And when the Lord chastens
[1:21:18] us, that means corrects us that we
[1:21:21] should not be condemned with the world.
[1:21:23] Listen. Amen. When when sermons come
[1:21:26] across and their correction and their
[1:21:28] reproof and their edification, that's
[1:21:30] not the time to get all mad. That's not
[1:21:33] the time to ball up and say, "Well, he's
[1:21:35] just old school and he's just
[1:21:36] oldfashioned. He's just some old
[1:21:38] preacher stuck back in the 70s and no, I
[1:21:41] wasn't even born in the 70s and the 80s.
[1:21:43] I was born in 96 if you want to know.
[1:21:46] But the same gospel in 25 ought to be
[1:21:48] the same gospel in 96. And if God
[1:21:50] carries us to 2050, we ought to still be
[1:21:53] preaching the same thing. We are not of
[1:21:56] this world. We are of another world.
[1:22:01] Yes, sir. He said we're to live an
[1:22:03] outstanding life. I don't know about
[1:22:05] you, but I want to live an outstanding
[1:22:07] life. Amen. If you're feeling condemned
[1:22:09] right now, rebuke that spirit and say,
[1:22:12] "God loves me enough to cause me to see
[1:22:15] the error of my ways."
[1:22:18] Ain't time to get mad at the word. Ain't
[1:22:20] time to get mad at the preacher. It's
[1:22:22] time to get mad at the devil that's got
[1:22:25] you in such a place that you can't back
[1:22:27] the word of God. Listen, I think it's
[1:22:29] time to get mad at the devil and say,
[1:22:31] "Devil, this is the last sermon that I
[1:22:33] will sit in that you keep me bound. This
[1:22:36] is the Glory to God. I know what I'm
[1:22:39] talking about." Amen. Right now, that
[1:22:41] devil trying to wad you up and tie you
[1:22:43] up and put you down and put you under
[1:22:45] some condemnation. Let me tell you this.
[1:22:47] God loves you and this word is for you.
[1:22:50] And if God loves you enough to preach
[1:22:51] this word to you, you ought to say,
[1:22:53] "Lord, I'm going to kick that devil out
[1:22:55] of my life. This is the last service
[1:22:58] I'll sit in that I can't amen the word
[1:23:00] of God. This is the last day that I'll
[1:23:02] live under the spirit of condemnation. I
[1:23:06] refuse to be in this message and to be
[1:23:08] bound by the God of this evil age. I
[1:23:11] refuse to be a part of a word born bride
[1:23:14] and be laid
[1:23:16] and be bound by leonosian influences.
[1:23:20] Yes sir. Yes sir. We are of another
[1:23:25] world.
[1:23:26] &gt;&gt; Now I got to say it. We're all the time
[1:23:28] referring to the world, aren't we? Amen.
[1:23:30] That's of the world or they're in the
[1:23:32] world. But I I asked brother the
[1:23:34] question yesterday. I'm sorry. I I study
[1:23:36] and I asked him when I was studying. No,
[1:23:38] I wasn't communing with the dead.
[1:23:41] I was reading the message.
[1:23:44] What is the world?
[1:23:47] Fair enough question. What is the world?
[1:23:50] John 14:19. Yet a little while, and the
[1:23:54] world seeth me no more,
[1:23:58] &gt;&gt; but ye see me.
[1:24:01] &gt;&gt; Sister Debbie, there's a world and
[1:24:04] there's a ye.
[1:24:05] &gt;&gt; Because I live, ye shall live also.
[1:24:09] Brother B says what is the world? He
[1:24:11] always goes to that scripture. He says
[1:24:13] the Greek word is cosmos which there
[1:24:16] means the world order.
[1:24:19] &gt;&gt; The world the unbelievers will see me no
[1:24:21] more.
[1:24:23] He said a little while and the
[1:24:24] unbelievers will see me no more. Yet ye
[1:24:26] shall see me. How many is thankful for
[1:24:28] that?
[1:24:29] &gt;&gt; For I'll be with you to the end of the
[1:24:32] world. Now watch this. Now what is it?
[1:24:34] The people who could only see with their
[1:24:37] natural sight, understanding, with their
[1:24:40] natural understanding, with their mental
[1:24:43] thinking, that's the end of Jesus
[1:24:45] forever for them. My sister Joyce,
[1:24:49] that's the end of Jesus forever for them
[1:24:52] until the judgment. So the unbeliever
[1:24:56] will not see him until they see him in
[1:24:59] the judgment. He said, "But yet a little
[1:25:02] while in the world." He said, "Now what
[1:25:04] is the world? It's the worldly minded."
[1:25:06] See? Amen. The worldly minded people,
[1:25:10] church members. My goodness. Did the
[1:25:13] church members actually see him in that
[1:25:14] day? No, sir. They never see him in the
[1:25:18] light of who he was. Oh, they seen his
[1:25:20] corporal body because they had a sense
[1:25:22] of sight. Those who couldn't see, he
[1:25:25] gave them their sight so they could see.
[1:25:27] But he said, "It'd be better if you was
[1:25:28] born blind, then you wouldn't have known
[1:25:30] it." See? Amen. They saw him in the
[1:25:33] light that he was a human being. That's
[1:25:35] all they saw of him was he was a human
[1:25:38] being, but they didn't see him in the
[1:25:41] light of the son of God. Oh, Grace
[1:25:43] tabernacle. If God has allowed your
[1:25:45] eyes, Amen, to see him beyond just the
[1:25:48] fact that he was a deity 2,000 years
[1:25:51] ago, but he's allowed you to see him in
[1:25:54] the present tense reality of who he is
[1:25:57] in the hour you're living in. You ought
[1:25:59] to put on your shouting shoes this
[1:26:01] morning and say, "Thank God, I don't
[1:26:03] just see him as some deity. I see him as
[1:26:07] my Lord. I see him as my Savior. I see
[1:26:10] him as my redeemer. Oh, I'm not going to
[1:26:13] see him as my judge. The next time I see
[1:26:16] him, it's going to be when he changes my
[1:26:18] body. The next time I see him, it's
[1:26:22] going to be in glory and in power."
[1:26:26] Hallelujah. What is the world
[1:26:28] represented there? Any minister knows.
[1:26:30] Is this okay?
[1:26:32] &gt;&gt; Amen. Now, now this might get a little
[1:26:34] heavy. Is that okay?
[1:26:36] &gt;&gt; Any minister knows it represents the
[1:26:38] world order.
[1:26:41] The regular routine.
[1:26:44] &gt;&gt; Y'all ready for this?
[1:26:46] &gt;&gt; Go to work on Monday. Go to church on
[1:26:49] Sunday. Go to work on Monday. Go back
[1:26:52] next Sunday. That's the world order.
[1:26:58] Church of the living God.
[1:27:00] &gt;&gt; If that's the way you're living, you're
[1:27:02] living by the world order.
[1:27:04] &gt;&gt; You say, "Why you say that?" He said,
[1:27:06] "They shall see me no more." You say,
[1:27:09] "See me?" Yes, sir. Why? We got eyes.
[1:27:11] You mean to tell us we're blind, Brother
[1:27:13] Brandham? Yes, sir. Well, I had my
[1:27:15] eyesight tested. It's 2020. But you're
[1:27:18] still blind. He said, "They will see me
[1:27:20] no more, yet ye shall see me." He said,
[1:27:23] "That's the elected, the church.
[1:27:26] Oh, glory to God. You ought to stop
[1:27:29] right now and raise your hands and thank
[1:27:31] God that you go to school with people.
[1:27:34] You work with people that have seen him,
[1:27:36] but they'll never see him again until
[1:27:38] they see him in the judgment. But God,
[1:27:41] who is rich in mercy, has allowed your
[1:27:44] eyes to see him in the visitation of the
[1:27:47] revelation of the word of the hour
[1:27:49] you're living in.
[1:27:51] Hallelujah. You say, "You lost your
[1:27:53] mind." I ain't lost my mind. If anybody
[1:27:56] got a righteous shout, it's somebody
[1:27:58] who's living and lay out a sea, but they
[1:28:01] got eyes to see and they got ears to
[1:28:04] hear and they got a heart to believe and
[1:28:06] they got a mouth to confess, I am a
[1:28:09] pilgrim and I am a stranger. I am only
[1:28:12] dwelling beside natives of this land,
[1:28:14] but I've come from another world.
[1:28:17] Hallelujah. Hallelujah. You are not of
[1:28:20] this world. Amen. God chose you out.
[1:28:26] Hallelujah. God chose you out.
[1:28:30] &gt;&gt; Can I tell you this morning, the world
[1:28:32] hates you because of God's choice. The
[1:28:36] world hates you because of God's choice.
[1:28:39] Man's choice is a lot different than
[1:28:41] God's choice. Brother said, "Sometimes
[1:28:43] your choice is not God's choice.
[1:28:46] Sometimes the church's choice is not
[1:28:48] God's choice." He said, "But if God
[1:28:51] hadn't elected you to be a Christian,
[1:28:53] you would not be a Christian. It's God's
[1:28:56] choice, not yours."
[1:28:59] &gt;&gt; Oh, thank you, Lord. Hallelujah. You
[1:29:02] say, "Preacher, I've been in a bad way.
[1:29:04] I've been through some bad things. I've
[1:29:06] been involved in some bad situations."
[1:29:08] But if God, who is rich in mercy, has
[1:29:11] allowed you to find yourself in the
[1:29:13] house of God on a Sunday morning, I
[1:29:16] don't care how low you are. I don't care
[1:29:18] how dirty you are. I don't care how bad
[1:29:21] you are. You ought to break out of that
[1:29:23] condition this morning and say, "Thank
[1:29:25] you, Lord, that you love me enough to
[1:29:28] give me one more chance."
[1:29:31] Hallelujah. To give me one more chance
[1:29:34] in this world of spiritual blindness.
[1:29:36] You say, "Why are you shouting?" Because
[1:29:39] all they can see is a Sunday morning
[1:29:40] service and work on Monday and Sunday
[1:29:43] again on Sunday and Monday again on
[1:29:45] Monday. But God has allowed me to climb
[1:29:49] up out of this world into another
[1:29:51] dimension. Listen, my revival don't stop
[1:29:54] when service ends. My joy don't stop
[1:29:57] when I leave the house of God. I've got
[1:29:59] an artisan well on the inside of my
[1:30:02] soul. That's why I can change the
[1:30:04] atmosphere. That's why I can believe in
[1:30:06] the face of hard times because I am not
[1:30:09] under the adaption of Leoa and his
[1:30:12] corrupt values. But I have broken to the
[1:30:14] realm of the pillar of fire and the log
[1:30:17] go of God. And when I don't feel like
[1:30:19] praising, I praise him anyhow. And when
[1:30:22] I don't feel like shouting, I shout
[1:30:24] anyhow. And when I don't feel like
[1:30:26] repenting because I feel justified, I
[1:30:29] repent anyhow because grace has elected
[1:30:32] me to see him in the hour that I'm
[1:30:36] living in.
[1:30:38] Hallelujah.
[1:30:39] Hallelujah.
[1:30:41] Satan, I defy you. I despy you. I
[1:30:45] denounce you this morning in the name of
[1:30:47] Jesus Christ.
[1:30:52] Hallelujah. He elected me.
[1:30:58] &gt;&gt; He only appears to those who believe him
[1:31:02] &gt;&gt; and love him.
[1:31:04] &gt;&gt; Brother Charles, and was elected to see
[1:31:07] him,
[1:31:11] &gt;&gt; oh, I got a bunch of quotes on that, but
[1:31:13] I got to keep going.
[1:31:15] How could a thorn wake up and be a
[1:31:17] thistle?
[1:31:19] Well, I'm just going to quit serving
[1:31:21] God. How can you
[1:31:26] &gt;&gt; when you were predestinated to serve
[1:31:28] him?
[1:31:29] &gt;&gt; How could the elected keep from seeing
[1:31:31] it? Because they are elected to see it.
[1:31:35] &gt;&gt; See, all the father has given me will
[1:31:38] come
[1:31:40] &gt;&gt; and none of them can come
[1:31:43] &gt;&gt; unless he gave them to me before the
[1:31:45] foundation of the world.
[1:31:48] &gt;&gt; Oh my. when their names was put on the
[1:31:51] lamb's book of life. Not on a church
[1:31:54] recctor, but on the book.
[1:31:56] &gt;&gt; Woo! Glory to God, brother Kobe. On the
[1:31:59] book. What book are you talking about?
[1:32:02] I'm talking about the lamb's book of
[1:32:04] life. Well, glory to God, Sister
[1:32:06] Shakana, that makes me want to shout.
[1:32:08] Amen. The devil couldn't stop you from
[1:32:10] coming if his life depended on it
[1:32:12] because your name is in the lamb's book
[1:32:15] of life.
[1:32:17] Come on, church. Amen. I might as well
[1:32:19] just say it. In an unseen world, in an
[1:32:22] unseen realm, and that world is more
[1:32:25] real than this world.
[1:32:28] Hallelujah. You say, "Preacher, why are
[1:32:30] you happy?" Because I was elected to see
[1:32:33] the revelation of the age, which would
[1:32:35] put me in contact with my theophony.
[1:32:39] Sister Joyce, why are you still serving
[1:32:42] God after all you've been through, after
[1:32:44] all the heartache, after all the
[1:32:46] battles? Because God, amen, came to
[1:32:49] Arkansas and found a seed inside the
[1:32:52] soul of a lady and he quickened that
[1:32:54] seed.
[1:32:55] Hallelujah. Hallelujah. Can I say it to
[1:32:58] you this morning? It's time to cut
[1:33:00] communication with the things of this
[1:33:02] world. It's time to cut communication
[1:33:04] with the things that pull you down and
[1:33:07] the things that drag you down. It's time
[1:33:09] to break out into a communion with the
[1:33:12] Lord and with the supernatural realm.
[1:33:16] Hallelujah.
[1:33:18] Hallelujah.
[1:33:20] What got a hold of you,
[1:33:22] brother Charles? What got a hold of you?
[1:33:24] Amen. What went over there in California
[1:33:26] and found you? I tell you what, then it
[1:33:29] was a revelation.
[1:33:32] &gt;&gt; Elected predestinated seed.
[1:33:34] &gt;&gt; Come on, church. We didn't get here by
[1:33:36] our good works. We didn't pray our way
[1:33:38] in here, Brother Travis. But God, who is
[1:33:40] rich in mercy, allowed our path to come
[1:33:43] in contact
[1:33:46] with the never failing revelation of the
[1:33:48] revealed word of the hour.
[1:33:51] &gt;&gt; Now you say, "Preacher, you're getting
[1:33:53] out there." Well, I just say this. I am
[1:33:55] in Leodysa, but I'm not of it.
[1:33:59] &gt;&gt; I know people get all tied up on this
[1:34:00] point, but let's just go ahead and let's
[1:34:02] just go ahead and take the seat belts
[1:34:03] off and
[1:34:05] &gt;&gt; let our hair down and kick our shoes off
[1:34:07] and and just enjoy it for a second.
[1:34:10] Leotans are Pentecostals and folks, they
[1:34:13] can't see what you're seeing.
[1:34:16] &gt;&gt; Glory to God. They can't see beyond a
[1:34:18] good Sunday morning service. Well, I
[1:34:21] feel I feel like preaching this morning.
[1:34:24] They can't see beyond the guitar getting
[1:34:26] hot and brother Roy the music getting to
[1:34:28] go 100 miles an hour and the preacher
[1:34:30] not getting to preach. Amen. They can't
[1:34:32] see beyond somebody just coming to the
[1:34:33] altar and speaking in tongues and
[1:34:35] joining their church and becoming a
[1:34:37] member of the UPC or the ALJC. They
[1:34:40] can't see beyond that. But God who is
[1:34:42] rich in mercy would send an eagle in
[1:34:44] this hour. Would send an eagle anointing
[1:34:46] and he would take you beyond just seeing
[1:34:48] a good Sunday morning. Hallelujah. Can I
[1:34:51] say this to you? If you never see
[1:34:54] another Sunday morning, I'll see you in
[1:34:56] the rapture. If we never see another
[1:34:59] good meeting, I'll see you in the
[1:35:02] rapture. Because I am a part of the
[1:35:05] world that can never perish. I am a part
[1:35:08] of the world that can never die.
[1:35:10] Hallelujah. Hallelujah.
[1:35:13] Hallelujah. Hallelujah. Oh, somebody
[1:35:17] give him praise. Fill the sanctuary with
[1:35:20] the praises unto the almighty God.
[1:35:23] Hallelujah. He is holy. He is holy. He
[1:35:27] is worthy. He is deserving of all
[1:35:30] praise, of all honor.
[1:35:34] [Applause]
[1:35:38] We are in Leosa,
[1:35:40] but we are not of Leotaa.
[1:35:43] Somebody say it with me. We are the
[1:35:45] bride.
[1:35:47] &gt;&gt; We are the bride.
[1:35:52] &gt;&gt; Says we are the bride.
[1:35:58] &gt;&gt; Therefore, Leoa
[1:36:01] is not our identification.
[1:36:04] Can I tell you what a prophet said? He
[1:36:07] said, "The end of the leotans."
[1:36:11] Now, folks, that's heavy.
[1:36:12] &gt;&gt; The end of the leotans.
[1:36:16] But you know what they're after? They're
[1:36:18] after the world order.
[1:36:20] &gt;&gt; And it only goes so far until the
[1:36:23] judgment.
[1:36:25] &gt;&gt; I wish I was a preacher this morning. It
[1:36:27] only goes so far. It only goes as far as
[1:36:32] they can let it go. The Leotans have an
[1:36:35] end. But God who is rich in mercy would
[1:36:38] send the seventh angel in the last days.
[1:36:41] And sister Barbara, he would turn over
[1:36:42] to Hebrews 7 and he would begin to
[1:36:45] preach about Melzdc. He would begin to
[1:36:47] preach about the kingdom. He would begin
[1:36:49] to preach about the order of Melzdc. And
[1:36:51] he would say, "Listen, amen. They might
[1:36:53] be after the world order."
[1:36:56] &gt;&gt; Glory to God. I feel like shouting,
[1:36:59] "They might be after the world order,
[1:37:01] but not you.
[1:37:05] But not you. That's why the devil hates
[1:37:07] you, brother David, is you are not after
[1:37:10] the world order that ends in judgment.
[1:37:13] But we are after another order and it is
[1:37:15] the order of Melzdc. And Paul said it is
[1:37:18] the power of an endless life.
[1:37:26] &gt;&gt; The devil is waiting on you to end.
[1:37:30] The devil is waiting on you to end.
[1:37:36] David Paul, the devil right now is
[1:37:38] waiting for you to end,
[1:37:41] &gt;&gt; Kyle. He's waiting for you to end. But
[1:37:44] there's a problem. You can't.
[1:37:48] [Applause]
[1:37:51] &gt;&gt; Glory to God.
[1:37:53] You can't. You say, "I can't." Because
[1:37:56] you never started.
[1:37:59] You never started.
[1:38:02] &gt;&gt; Oh, give me some shout room. I never
[1:38:05] started. I was in the mind of God when
[1:38:09] the sons of God were shouting for joy. I
[1:38:13] never started. Therefore, I'll never
[1:38:15] end.
[1:38:17] [Applause]
[1:38:20] &gt;&gt; Oh God, I know I'm getting loose, but
[1:38:21] I'm feeling good. I'll never end. I'll
[1:38:25] never end.
[1:38:28] I will never end.
[1:38:32] Brother Joel, when are you going to end?
[1:38:36] &gt;&gt; David Paul, when are you going to end?
[1:38:39] Sister Kalissa, when are you going to
[1:38:40] end? When are you going to end? Destiny
[1:38:45] Sister Beth, when are you going to end?
[1:38:47] Sister Lillian, when are you going to
[1:38:49] end? When are you going to end? When are
[1:38:51] you going to end praising God? Brother
[1:38:54] Mark, when are you going to end
[1:38:55] preaching the word of God and believing
[1:38:57] the things of God? Come on, young
[1:38:59] people. When are you going to end? Quit
[1:39:00] living above Leodysia and living above
[1:39:03] the things of this world.
[1:39:05] Oh, I feel like stopping right now and
[1:39:07] taking a whole new text and calling it I
[1:39:09] shall never end. I shall never end
[1:39:13] because I never began.
[1:39:16] Devil, if you don't like my praise, it's
[1:39:20] never going to end.
[1:39:23] If you don't like my believing, it's
[1:39:25] never going to end. If you don't like
[1:39:28] Grace Tabernacle, it's never going to
[1:39:31] end. Cuz one of these days, we're going
[1:39:34] to break out into a meeting in the air.
[1:39:39] It's an unending revival. It's an
[1:39:41] unending world. It's a never perishing
[1:39:44] dimension.
[1:39:47] [Applause]
[1:39:48] We will never end. We will never end. We
[1:39:52] will never end.
[1:39:54] &gt;&gt; Oh, glory to God. We will never end.
[1:39:58] See, because we're under God's choice.
[1:40:02] &gt;&gt; Now, can I say it to you like this?
[1:40:05] &gt;&gt; If you were under your choice, you'd
[1:40:07] say, "This is as far as I can go."
[1:40:14] You know that
[1:40:17] &gt;&gt; if you're under your choice,
[1:40:20] &gt;&gt; Brother Travis, if you were under your
[1:40:22] choice, you would say, "Look, this is as
[1:40:25] far as I can go. But if you're under
[1:40:27] God's choice,
[1:40:30] &gt;&gt; you're a man named Moses, and they're
[1:40:33] slaves of God's children in the mud pits
[1:40:35] of Egypt." And you know what he says? He
[1:40:38] says, "Take these children out of the
[1:40:41] land of Egypt." Oh, God. I'm I'm sorry.
[1:40:44] I I pray you got time to have a little
[1:40:45] more church. Is that okay?
[1:40:48] &gt;&gt; Everybody feeling good this morning?
[1:40:50] &gt;&gt; Amen. Are you enjoying the word?
[1:40:52] &gt;&gt; Amen. You can go this far, Moses, but
[1:40:55] you can't take them no farther. Amen.
[1:40:58] You can go this far. Leave your wife and
[1:41:01] leave your babies and leave your cattle.
[1:41:04] Leave those things behind. Amen. You'll
[1:41:06] have to come back. But see, Moses made
[1:41:09] his choice by revelation. You say, "Now
[1:41:11] preacher, you mean to tell me that God
[1:41:14] is is making my choice for me?" Amen.
[1:41:17] Brother said this way. He said, "Now
[1:41:19] look, maybe this morning." He said, "Oh,
[1:41:21] I'm I'm butchering this part, but just
[1:41:22] give me grace." He said, "There'll be
[1:41:24] men and women sitting here that'll make
[1:41:26] your final choice. You are today what
[1:41:29] you are because several years ago, you
[1:41:32] chose to be what you are now."
[1:41:35] You know why you're not sitting here
[1:41:36] bitter this morning is because several
[1:41:39] years ago you chose to forgive.
[1:41:44] &gt;&gt; You know why you're not sitting here?
[1:41:46] Amen. Some of you all are not sitting
[1:41:47] here in the in the wilderness of
[1:41:49] confusion is because several years ago
[1:41:51] you made the choice to follow God. And
[1:41:54] now he says what you choose now will
[1:41:57] determine what you'll be five years from
[1:41:59] today. Five years from today, you may be
[1:42:01] a missionary and you may be a renowned
[1:42:04] Christian or you may be in hell because
[1:42:06] you made the wrong decision. Five years
[1:42:08] from today, you may be cleaning spit
[1:42:10] tunes in a barroom or you may be a
[1:42:12] prostitute on the street or you may be a
[1:42:15] man or woman that's a credit to any
[1:42:17] society
[1:42:18] because of your choice for Christ.
[1:42:22] &gt;&gt; Five years from today, you may be in
[1:42:24] glory, gone in the rapture because you
[1:42:26] made your choice today. But you got to
[1:42:29] choose. Don't look at what you see. Can
[1:42:32] I Can I say this to you this morning?
[1:42:34] Don't make your choice by what you see.
[1:42:40] &gt;&gt; Choose by faith.
[1:42:42] &gt;&gt; Brother said, "Listen, don't look at the
[1:42:44] modern things around you, the popularity
[1:42:46] and the glamour. Choose by faith him
[1:42:49] that give the promise that someday he
[1:42:51] will come and will right all wrongs."
[1:42:54] Come on. Someday all wrongs will be
[1:42:57] right and will give you eternal life and
[1:42:59] will raise you up. Listen. Amen. I say
[1:43:02] this to you this morning. Abraham and
[1:43:05] Lot had two choices. Amen. Can I say
[1:43:07] this to you? Amen. Lot Amen. Make your
[1:43:10] choice. You know what Lot did? He went
[1:43:12] down to the wellwatered plains of Sodom
[1:43:16] and he made a choice. And that choice
[1:43:18] had limitations.
[1:43:22] &gt;&gt; Oh, is this okay this morning?
[1:43:24] that choice. Brother David had
[1:43:26] limitations. Yes, he could be the mayor.
[1:43:29] Yes, he could be a fine upstanding
[1:43:31] citizen of Sodom. But look at Abraham.
[1:43:34] When Lot made his choice, then God
[1:43:36] said,"Abraham, look up at the sky. Can
[1:43:39] you number the stars?"
[1:43:42] &gt;&gt; Oh, God. Brother Jared, can you number
[1:43:45] the stars? He said, "Look at the
[1:43:47] seashore. Can you number the grains of
[1:43:49] sand upon the seashore?" He said, "No."
[1:43:52] He said, "Then so shall thy seed be."
[1:43:55] Oh, what are you saying, Brother Andrew?
[1:43:57] I'm saying this. Amen. I'm turning a
[1:43:59] corner and somebody say, "Amen."
[1:44:02] &gt;&gt; Amen. Are you still enjoying the word?
[1:44:04] Amen. Can I say this to you this
[1:44:06] morning? Brother Brandham come and he
[1:44:08] introduced to us the idea of two worlds.
[1:44:11] Somebody say that with me. Two worlds.
[1:44:14] You know what he would call it? He would
[1:44:15] call it a dual condition. You know what
[1:44:18] else he would say? He would say, "You
[1:44:20] are working in two worlds." Can I say
[1:44:24] what a prophet said? He said, "You don't
[1:44:26] realize, friend, what a strain."
[1:44:31] &gt;&gt; You're living in two worlds at the same
[1:44:35] time.
[1:44:36] &gt;&gt; It's in another world. Are you with me?
[1:44:39] &gt;&gt; You live in two worlds. There's no need
[1:44:42] of trying to explain it because you just
[1:44:45] can't explain it. You just have to
[1:44:47] believe it. Listen, he says you are in a
[1:44:51] dimension that the world knows nothing
[1:44:54] about.
[1:44:56] &gt;&gt; In other words, a vision causes you to
[1:44:59] be in two worlds at the same time.
[1:45:02] You're in this world here now, yet
[1:45:04] you're in another world. Amen. Can I
[1:45:06] just cut to the chase and say it? You're
[1:45:09] living in two worlds.
[1:45:12] &gt;&gt; You're here and then you're in another
[1:45:15] world. Are you ready for this? And you
[1:45:18] can't help that.
[1:45:20] [Applause]
[1:45:22] &gt;&gt; Oh, thank you, Jesus. You say, "Why are
[1:45:26] you like you are? I'm sorry. I can't
[1:45:29] help it.
[1:45:31] I can't help it." Somebody say, "Why
[1:45:33] can't you stay depressed?" Because I'm
[1:45:35] in another world. And the reality of the
[1:45:38] joy of that world is more real than the
[1:45:42] depression in this world. Somebody say,
[1:45:43] "Why can't you stay sick?" because I'm
[1:45:46] in another world and the reality of the
[1:45:49] atonement of divine healing in that
[1:45:52] other world is more real.
[1:45:57] Somebody just go ahead and say, "I can't
[1:45:58] help it. I can't help it. I'm not
[1:46:01] ashamed of it. I can't help it. I'm
[1:46:04] sorry if you don't like me coming
[1:46:06] around. I'm sorry if you don't like the
[1:46:09] joy I bring. I'm sorry if you don't like
[1:46:12] the atmosphere that I bring. I can't
[1:46:15] help it. I'm under the influence of
[1:46:17] another world and it's more real than
[1:46:19] this world.
[1:46:23] Can I preach this morning? Amen. Why are
[1:46:25] we still shouting in the face of World
[1:46:28] War II? Because we've already heard from
[1:46:31] another world. And that other world
[1:46:33] said, "Before one bomb ever strikes this
[1:46:36] land, you'll be seated at the marriage
[1:46:39] supper of the lamb."
[1:46:41] Some of you all have been through bitter
[1:46:43] losses. You've buried loved ones and
[1:46:45] babies and friends and family in the
[1:46:48] ground, but you're still here in the
[1:46:50] house of God with your hands up in the
[1:46:52] air. You know why? Because you're under
[1:46:56] the influence of another world. And that
[1:46:59] world says, "Some morning between 6:00
[1:47:03] and 9 when I'm standing there getting
[1:47:05] ready, my loved ones are going to
[1:47:07] appear.
[1:47:09] Am I a crazy man? Am I crazy for
[1:47:11] believing this? Am I crazy for believing
[1:47:14] this? I say, "No, I was born to believe
[1:47:17] it."
[1:47:19] &gt;&gt; And so are you.
[1:47:22] [Applause]
[1:47:24] &gt;&gt; You can't help what you believe. You was
[1:47:26] born to believe it.
[1:47:29] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. I got to say it. I got to
[1:47:32] say it very plainly this morning. Thank
[1:47:33] God.
[1:47:35] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen.
[1:47:38] Hallelujah. If I was in a lodge this
[1:47:40] morning, we'd already be at
[1:47:43] &gt;&gt; some restaurant.
[1:47:47] But I'm not in a lodge this morning. I'm
[1:47:50] in heavenly places.
[1:47:52] [Applause]
[1:47:53] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. I'm not in a denominational
[1:47:57] gathering this morning. I'm in the
[1:47:59] gathering of eagles.
[1:48:03] &gt;&gt; Christ and the angels are here.
[1:48:10] Christ is here.
[1:48:14] &gt;&gt; What if I told you the angels? Amen. I I
[1:48:18] don't I'm not a crazy man prone to
[1:48:20] fanatics, but I'll just say it this
[1:48:21] morning. God bless you all that's
[1:48:22] streaming. I believe this same
[1:48:24] atmosphere right now can be in your
[1:48:25] homes.
[1:48:29] &gt;&gt; Christ and the angels are here
[1:48:32] and they have the ability to influence
[1:48:34] us.
[1:48:41] But can I just say it, brother John?
[1:48:45] But thank God
[1:48:47] we have something in us to respond.
[1:48:55] If you got the Holy Spirit in you, then
[1:48:56] you're a candidate for association with
[1:48:58] the unseen world
[1:49:00] &gt;&gt; and the supernatural.
[1:49:02] &gt;&gt; No wonder people can't believe those
[1:49:04] things. They've never come in contact.
[1:49:09] &gt;&gt; Can I bring this down?
[1:49:12] &gt;&gt; They got nothing in here
[1:49:14] &gt;&gt; to believe with.
[1:49:20] &gt;&gt; Can I just say it?
[1:49:22] &gt;&gt; We should never have dead services in
[1:49:24] Grace Tabernacle.
[1:49:27] We should never have services where we
[1:49:29] allow the things of this world
[1:49:31] &gt;&gt; on it
[1:49:32] &gt;&gt; to put a spirit of heaviness upon our
[1:49:34] praise and to put a spirit of heaviness
[1:49:36] upon our thanksgiving. Listen, when the
[1:49:39] Holy Spirit comes in the heart, quickly
[1:49:42] you become being a two-fold being.
[1:49:46] &gt;&gt; One of the earth to die and one of the
[1:49:50] heaven to live. In his body, he's still
[1:49:54] subject to death. But in his soul,
[1:50:00] &gt;&gt; brother Emanuel, in your soul, you have
[1:50:03] passed from death unto life. In his
[1:50:06] body, he has contact with his five
[1:50:09] senses. But in his spirit, he has a
[1:50:12] contact with God through the Holy Ghost.
[1:50:16] And the angels of God visits them.
[1:50:19] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:50:21] Oh, church, I'll just say it to you. I'm
[1:50:23] sorry. I I don't mean to get open here
[1:50:25] this morning, but I'm just going to get
[1:50:26] open. In our darkest of hours, in our
[1:50:29] darkest of trials, Amen. God still has
[1:50:33] angels.
[1:50:35] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Amen. Amen. I don't mean to
[1:50:38] get too open here, but I'm just going to
[1:50:39] say it because I feel to testify of the
[1:50:42] never failing goodness of God. Amen. The
[1:50:44] other the other day we were there and
[1:50:46] just got home and Malachi fell and we
[1:50:48] took him down there to Jonesber and had
[1:50:50] him checked out and they said he had
[1:50:52] broke his leg and they said you got to
[1:50:53] take him down here to Memphis and and
[1:50:55] you parents know amen that whirlwind of
[1:50:57] emotions and things that happened. Amen.
[1:50:59] And we're sitting there and and I'm
[1:51:01] thinking dear Lord and and you know
[1:51:02] sometimes God bless them but you know
[1:51:04] doctors they just sometimes say things
[1:51:05] that really you know
[1:51:09] don't calm the emotions but they're good
[1:51:11] people. They're just doing their job
[1:51:13] right. Amen. And the doctors and said,
[1:51:15] "Lad, you're going have to hurry and get
[1:51:16] down there and I don't know how and you
[1:51:17] know and all this." And I'm sitting
[1:51:19] there thinking and so they come in and
[1:51:20] said, "Well, you're going have to take
[1:51:21] him by ambulance." And and you know, you
[1:51:23] may think I'm crazy this morning, but I
[1:51:26] can't help it. I can't help it. I'm more
[1:51:29] in contact with that world
[1:51:31] &gt;&gt; than I am with this world. And when
[1:51:34] things go wrong in this world, brother
[1:51:36] Tim, I say, "Thank God, I've got a
[1:51:38] direct communication to another world.
[1:51:44] So the doctor said, "Well, the EMS is
[1:51:46] going to come and get him." And God is
[1:51:47] my witness. I'm sitting there and we're
[1:51:49] thinking and all of a sudden the
[1:51:50] paramedics walked in and I know people
[1:51:53] going to think I'm crazy, but it's
[1:51:54] nothing new. Amen. The paramedics walked
[1:51:56] in and I looked up and God is my
[1:51:58] witness. There was a man stepped in that
[1:52:00] room and he looked like he literally
[1:52:02] looked like Billy Paul Brandham just
[1:52:04] stepped right in that room. I have never
[1:52:06] seen a man that looked more like Billy
[1:52:08] Paul than I saw that man look that
[1:52:10] night. And when he stepped in there,
[1:52:12] amen, just the kindest spirit and the
[1:52:14] sweetest spirit. And we're riding down
[1:52:16] the road there to Memphis and I'm just
[1:52:18] thinking and brother Matt had called was
[1:52:19] praying and all of a sudden I looked
[1:52:21] over and I said, "God, they're going to
[1:52:23] think I'm crazy, but I just got to say
[1:52:25] it." I said, "Sir, can I tell you
[1:52:27] something?" And he said, "What do you
[1:52:29] mean?" I said, "Well, I want to tell
[1:52:30] you, you look like somebody that's very
[1:52:33] special to me." He said, "Who would that
[1:52:35] be?" Amen. And before I could say it,
[1:52:37] you know what he said? He stopped me. He
[1:52:39] said, "Let me ask you something." He
[1:52:40] said, 'You a Christian, aren't you? I
[1:52:42] said, 'Yes, sir. He said, ' Do you
[1:52:44] believe in angels?
[1:52:46] He said, ' Do you believe? Now, you can
[1:52:48] laugh at this and make fun of it if you
[1:52:49] want to, but I thank God for it. He
[1:52:52] said, "Do you believe in angels?" I
[1:52:53] said, "I do." Amen. I said, "Let me tell
[1:52:55] you something. The man I'm getting ready
[1:52:57] to tell you you look like." Amen. Mess
[1:52:59] the angel of the Lord. And he said,
[1:53:01] "Young boy." And I said, "Sir, his name
[1:53:03] is Billy Paul Brandom." And I turned the
[1:53:05] picture around. You know what he said?
[1:53:07] He said, "I can't believe that I got a
[1:53:09] twin." I said, "His name is Billy Paul
[1:53:11] Brandon." He said, "Sir, my name's
[1:53:13] Billy."
[1:53:16] Now listen, you make out of that
[1:53:18] whatever you want to, but as for me and
[1:53:20] my house, I'm going to say it like
[1:53:22] Brother Wayne Lawson said, "I still
[1:53:25] believe in angelic intervention in
[1:53:27] humanistic affairs." And I want to say
[1:53:30] to you this morning, church, I don't
[1:53:32] know what you're going through. I don't
[1:53:33] know what you're facing. I don't know
[1:53:35] what tomorrow holds. I don't know what
[1:53:37] yesterday held. I don't know what next
[1:53:39] week holds. But may I say it to you and
[1:53:42] may I say it with everything within me.
[1:53:45] No matter what tomorrow holds, remember
[1:53:48] you're of another world. Remember, you
[1:53:51] have contact to another dimension. And
[1:53:54] when everything looks like it's time to
[1:53:55] give up, that other dimension says,
[1:53:57] "Give it all you got."
[1:54:02] It's real. It's real. Amen. Amen. Then I
[1:54:06] Oh, glory to God.
[1:54:09] &gt;&gt; It's real.
[1:54:11] &gt;&gt; It's real. Amen. Amen. If you would if
[1:54:14] you would get beyond the humanistic
[1:54:16] realm right now, you would see there's a
[1:54:18] whole realm of angelic beings in this
[1:54:21] building right now.
[1:54:24] Hallelujah. Hallelujah. Amen. I know I'm
[1:54:26] going over, but I feel like punching
[1:54:28] that devil square in the face. You know
[1:54:30] what I think it's time to do for a Grace
[1:54:31] Tabernacle? I think it's time to forget
[1:54:34] all the little social under
[1:54:35] misunderstandings and forget all little
[1:54:37] ill feelings and forget all the little
[1:54:39] he said she said that they think it's
[1:54:41] time to forget it all and realize
[1:54:43] there's a realm here that's more real
[1:54:45] than the realm of unforgiveness and
[1:54:48] bitterness that's holding you back.
[1:54:53] Hey. Amen. I'm going to say it. Amen.
[1:54:55] Amen. We got down there and I know
[1:54:57] people think I'm crazy. Amen. But God
[1:54:59] sent two more angels in the form of
[1:55:01] Sister Lori and Sister Cindy in there.
[1:55:04] Amen. I tell you folks, Amen. I know you
[1:55:06] think we're crazy, but this is real to
[1:55:09] me. And if it would become real to you,
[1:55:11] then the house of God and the things of
[1:55:14] God would no longer be a joke. It would
[1:55:16] no longer be a little haha. It would be
[1:55:19] dear God, this is a realm of another
[1:55:22] world. This is human beings possessed
[1:55:25] with a dimension of reality.
[1:55:28] and they're here to help.
[1:55:32] Listen, let me say it to you this and
[1:55:34] I'll say it and I'm done. That world is
[1:55:36] more real than this world.
[1:55:40] &gt;&gt; Let me say it to you. And there's no end
[1:55:42] to it.
[1:55:44] &gt;&gt; There's no end to it. I got a whole
[1:55:45] sermon here, but I'm just going to get
[1:55:47] right here and I'm going to just close
[1:55:49] by saying this.
[1:55:52] That realm is real.
[1:56:00] I'm sorry.
[1:56:03] &gt;&gt; And when that realm, brother one, comes
[1:56:06] into that redeemed flesh,
[1:56:08] &gt;&gt; that realm has more authority to this
[1:56:11] realm.
[1:56:13] &gt;&gt; You're a witness of it, aren't you,
[1:56:14] sister?
[1:56:15] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:56:20] Sister Sandy, I'm not a crazy man.
[1:56:25] Brother Jim could be walking the streets
[1:56:27] right now.
[1:56:30] &gt;&gt; You say, "Oh, you lost your mind." No, I
[1:56:32] haven't. That realm is more real than
[1:56:34] this realm. Haven, that realm is more
[1:56:37] real. You say, "Brother Andrew, it's too
[1:56:40] far away." No. When that realm comes
[1:56:42] into that flesh, come on. How did
[1:56:45] Brother Bam stand there in a in a 16
[1:56:47] element? Are you still enjoying the
[1:56:50] word?
[1:56:50] &gt;&gt; How did Brother Brandham stay there in
[1:56:52] that 16 element realm
[1:56:55] and stand there as a frail human being
[1:56:58] and stand there, brother Joel, and say
[1:57:00] these words for the glory of God and in
[1:57:03] the name of Jesus Christ. I take every
[1:57:05] spirit.
[1:57:08] &gt;&gt; I take every spirit in this building
[1:57:11] under my control for the glory of God
[1:57:15] and to help the people. Amen.
[1:57:19] &gt;&gt; God, I wish I as a preacher there was
[1:57:21] something between them.
[1:57:23] &gt;&gt; There was something between those realms
[1:57:26] that didn't want you to make contact
[1:57:27] with it.
[1:57:29] &gt;&gt; Can I just say it? When you come in here
[1:57:31] and you're depressed, there's something
[1:57:33] between you and that realm. It's called
[1:57:35] depression. And it don't want you to
[1:57:37] reach out because that devil knows. If
[1:57:40] you just make contact,
[1:57:44] &gt;&gt; if you just make contact with that
[1:57:47] realm, then there begins to come a
[1:57:49] charge into this flesh. And you said,
[1:57:52] "I'm going to give up." And you said,
[1:57:53] "I'm going to quit." And you said, "I
[1:57:55] made too many mistakes, and I'm too much
[1:57:58] of a failure." And you're sitting there,
[1:58:00] but then you start receiving charge
[1:58:02] after charge. Listen, this ain't good
[1:58:04] energy, and it ain't good vibes. It's
[1:58:05] called the Holy Ghost. You start
[1:58:07] receiving, Amen. charge after charge of
[1:58:10] the Holy Ghost. And something raises up
[1:58:12] in you and says, "I've already made it.
[1:58:16] I'm already made it. Greater is he that
[1:58:19] is in me than he that is in the world.
[1:58:26] That realm
[1:58:28] &gt;&gt; is real
[1:58:31] &gt;&gt; and it's in you this morning.
[1:58:35] Subdue that devil.
[1:58:39] Subdue that spirit right now. Subdue it
[1:58:43] right now. Say, "In the name of Jesus
[1:58:46] Christ,
[1:58:48] I take every spirit."
[1:58:51] Come on. In the name of Jesus Christ, I
[1:58:55] take every spirit under my control
[1:58:59] for the glory of God.
[1:59:01] This is the last day. Satan, you will
[1:59:04] control me.
[1:59:06] &gt;&gt; I'm in your world,
[1:59:08] but I'm not of it.
[1:59:12] &gt;&gt; Let our musicians come this morning.
[1:59:15] There's a realm, and it's real.
[1:59:19] It's real right now. It's right here in
[1:59:22] this building.
[1:59:25] Listen,
[1:59:26] how many says, "Lord, I want to
[1:59:27] entertain that dimension.
[1:59:31] I want to entertain
[1:59:33] that world
[1:59:36] more than this world.
[1:59:39] &gt;&gt; You say, "Preacher, when a believer
[1:59:42] dies, it's over." I'm sorry. I beg to
[1:59:45] differ with you.
[1:59:47] &gt;&gt; I beg to differ with you. I beg to
[1:59:51] differ with you this morning.
[1:59:53] How many knows brother Homer Longora,
[1:59:56] his wife Sister Margie laying there
[1:59:58] several I think nearly I think this year
[2:00:01] was next year will be 10 years laying
[2:00:03] there
[2:00:05] on her on her sick bed and and she was
[2:00:08] passing
[2:00:11] such a presence of the Lord in that room
[2:00:12] and the testimony come like this.
[2:00:16] She's laying there and she looks over at
[2:00:19] brother I believe it was brother Homer
[2:00:21] and
[2:00:25] and she says, "Oh,
[2:00:29] there's Daniel Williams."
[2:00:32] Come on, folks. Anybody ever heard of
[2:00:35] Brother Danny Williams died years ago,
[2:00:40] she said, "Holr,
[2:00:42] I believe that's what he said it. God
[2:00:43] bless you, brother Homer, if you hear
[2:00:44] this and I'm wrong, correct me, but
[2:00:45] said, brother said, Homer, there's
[2:00:47] Daniel Williams." And said,
[2:00:52] He's still got his sense of humor.
[2:01:00] Just because you can't see it
[2:01:04] don't mean it's not happening.
[2:01:08] It's real this morning. It's right here
[2:01:11] in this building this morning.
[2:01:14] You know what a prophet of God said? He
[2:01:15] said these words right here. He said,
[2:01:17] "That's why you feel this strange call.
[2:01:21] You feel this strange pull to go to that
[2:01:25] world because it's real
[2:01:29] and it's more real than this world. I
[2:01:32] wonder this morning with every heart
[2:01:33] open before the Lord. I wonder how many
[2:01:35] could say, "Holy Spirit, come by my
[2:01:38] heart today
[2:01:39] [Music]
[2:01:42] and disassociate me
[2:01:44] with everything
[2:01:47] that's unlike that world.
[2:01:53] Lord,
[2:01:54] if there's static in our communication
[2:01:59] by my way this morning,
[2:02:02] clear up the static.
[2:02:04] Brother David, you're a witness this
[2:02:06] morning. Amen. How do we know that right
[2:02:10] now in another dimension, maybe just
[2:02:11] right, not not even on the other side of
[2:02:12] that wall, Brother Howard be standing.
[2:02:15] Your mom and daddy standing right there.
[2:02:18] They say, "Oh, preacher, you're just
[2:02:19] pulling heartstrings." No, I'm preaching
[2:02:21] the reality of this word.
[2:02:24] I've got a witness in this building
[2:02:25] today. There's a dimension here.
[2:02:30] It's real,
[2:02:33] brother Joel. It's more real than the
[2:02:34] truck you drive. It's more real than the
[2:02:37] clothes you wear. It's another world.
[2:02:41] What about it, young man? How many say,
[2:02:43] "Lord, thank you for choosing me out of
[2:02:45] the millions to see this word."
[2:02:49] Out of the millions of young ladies, God
[2:02:52] chose you young ladies
[2:02:54] to see this revelation.
[2:02:57] [Music]
[2:02:58] With every head bowed, every eye closed
[2:03:00] this morning.
[2:03:04] Hearts are open this morning. The spirit
[2:03:07] of God is moving across this building
[2:03:08] today.
[2:03:11] There's a real
[2:03:13] There's a real reality.
[2:03:15] There's a real reality here this
[2:03:17] morning.
[2:03:20] Oh my. I think of many that's gone on
[2:03:22] here that we've known through the years.
[2:03:25] I can't help but believe they're
[2:03:26] standing right here in this building
[2:03:28] this morning in another dimension.
[2:03:32] It's more real than this one. I I wonder
[2:03:34] today if there be somebody here say,
[2:03:36] "Lord, sanctify me all over again today.
[2:03:40] Lord, scour me out all over again today.
[2:03:45] Lord, I'm sorry for the things I've
[2:03:47] allowed to come between me and you.
[2:03:50] Lord, I'm sorry for the things that I've
[2:03:52] allowed to interrupt my communication
[2:03:54] with that other world. Lord, I'm asking
[2:03:57] you this morning to forgive me. Lord,
[2:03:59] I've adapted to values and I've become
[2:04:02] more of a conformist than I have become
[2:04:04] a purposeful living person. I've I've
[2:04:07] I've I've I've laid down somewhere. But
[2:04:10] today, Lord, I'm asking you. Come by my
[2:04:13] way today, Lord. Maybe there's something
[2:04:15] you're holding on to and and you need to
[2:04:18] let it go. This morning, I want to ask
[2:04:19] you today, what choice will you make?
[2:04:23] Will you choose the influence of this
[2:04:25] world or will you choose the influence
[2:04:27] of another world?
[2:04:30] See, if there's something you need to
[2:04:31] make right between you and someone else,
[2:04:34] what would keep that between you is the
[2:04:36] influence of this world. But if you get
[2:04:38] in the influence of that world, it's a
[2:04:40] world of forgiveness. And it's a world
[2:04:41] of unity and peace. And you would say,
[2:04:44] "Lord, I want to I want to let it go
[2:04:46] this morning. I want I want my
[2:04:48] communication restored." God bless you
[2:04:50] there, brother. He sees you. God bless
[2:04:52] you, sis. God bless you there. God bless
[2:04:54] you in the back there, sis. Some have
[2:04:56] slipped up to their feet. Some are just
[2:04:57] opening their hearts there. this
[2:04:59] morning. The Holy Spirit just sweeping
[2:05:01] across the building right now. Oh, open
[2:05:04] my heart this morning. In that world,
[2:05:07] there's no anxiety.
[2:05:09] In that world, there's no nervousness.
[2:05:11] In that world, there's no unrest,
[2:05:13] unsettled feelings. It's a world of
[2:05:16] peace. It's a world of love. It's a
[2:05:19] world of love. It's a world of power.
[2:05:22] Hallelujah.
[2:05:24] Hallelujah. This morning, as we open our
[2:05:25] hearts in prayer, would you join with
[2:05:27] me? Almighty God, Father, we come before
[2:05:30] you today in this sanctuary.
[2:05:33] Lord, we broke out of the realm of this
[2:05:34] world today, Father. Lord, I'm so glad
[2:05:38] to be identified with associates of
[2:05:40] another world. Lord, we're in this
[2:05:42] world, but Lord, we're not of this
[2:05:44] world. Father, we're in Leosa, but we're
[2:05:48] not of Leosa.
[2:05:51] Lord, we're in time, but we're not of
[2:05:53] time. Father, we have stepped from
[2:05:56] eternity into time. And your prophet
[2:05:58] said, "When the trials and testings of
[2:06:00] this life are over, we'll step back out
[2:06:02] of time into eternity." And Lord, this
[2:06:06] morning, I know the devil is doing
[2:06:07] everything he can to interrupt the
[2:06:10] communication of this people and that
[2:06:12] other world because when that other
[2:06:15] world comes into this world, into this
[2:06:17] flesh, into this earth, Lord, their body
[2:06:20] is of this earth.
[2:06:21] Lord, at one time we belong to this
[2:06:24] world. By our first birth, we belong to
[2:06:27] this world. We were born in sin, shape,
[2:06:29] and iniquity. We come in the world
[2:06:31] speaking lies. But oh, there was another
[2:06:34] birth. Hallelujah. There was a second
[2:06:37] birth of the water and the blood and the
[2:06:39] spirit. And Lord, that blood would break
[2:06:41] the curse of our first birth. Lord, the
[2:06:44] power of that birth would break the
[2:06:46] strongholds of our first birth. Lord,
[2:06:49] every spirit, every every stronghold of
[2:06:52] the enemy that had us tied down to this
[2:06:54] world, Lord, that spirit broke the cords
[2:06:57] of it, Father. And Lord, this morning we
[2:07:00] can boldly profess we do not belong to
[2:07:03] this world. We do not belong to Leosa,
[2:07:07] Lord. Just as you sent Moses into Egypt,
[2:07:10] he did not belong to Egypt, Lord. He
[2:07:13] belonged to you. He was a part of the
[2:07:15] covenant, Father. And Lord, I pray this
[2:07:17] morning that every one of my brothers
[2:07:19] and sisters here today, Lord, as they
[2:07:21] have set so tentatively to your word,
[2:07:23] and Lord, if they have so pulled this
[2:07:25] morning and open up channels in the
[2:07:27] realities of your word, I'm asking this
[2:07:30] morning, dear God, may you come by every
[2:07:32] heart today, Father. And Lord, may you
[2:07:35] restore the communication to that other
[2:07:37] world. Lord, if there be one here today
[2:07:39] that's let the world and popularity
[2:07:42] overpurpose get between them. Father,
[2:07:45] may they shake it today, dear God. Lord,
[2:07:48] if something of corruption of this age
[2:07:50] has come into their lives, Lord, as I
[2:07:53] was just sitting there meditating
[2:07:54] yesterday in my office and thinking upon
[2:07:56] these things, I begin to think how that
[2:07:58] we are in the world and we have to do
[2:08:01] things the world does, but we don't do
[2:08:02] it like the world does it. Father, we
[2:08:05] have to walk in the world, but we don't
[2:08:07] walk like the world. We have to talk in
[2:08:09] this world, but we don't talk like the
[2:08:11] world. Father, we have to dress in this
[2:08:14] world, but Lord, we don't dress like the
[2:08:16] world. Father, I remember as a young
[2:08:18] man, Lord, when when the pull of the
[2:08:20] world and the pressure of of school and
[2:08:23] friends, Lord, to become a part of
[2:08:25] things, dear God. And Lord, you know my
[2:08:27] heart. I remember that stand, that
[2:08:29] taken, Lord. Father, as a young man,
[2:08:31] they were pressuring me to play a
[2:08:32] certain sport there in school and said,
[2:08:34] "Just wear shorts. It's no big deal.
[2:08:36] Just do it." And Lord, as a young man,
[2:08:38] you had called me to preach this word.
[2:08:40] And Father, you know the choice I had to
[2:08:42] make. Lord, I chose to take that time
[2:08:45] and put it in your word and study.
[2:08:47] Father, yes, Lord, there was reproach.
[2:08:49] And yes, Lord, there was a lot of making
[2:08:51] fun of, but Lord, I thank you today,
[2:08:53] dear God, because today, Lord, I stand
[2:08:55] here, Amen, reaping the benefits of that
[2:08:58] choice, Lord. Father, you gave me a Holy
[2:09:00] Ghost filled wife, and you've given me
[2:09:02] two babies, Lord, and your grace has
[2:09:04] been upon my life, Father. Lord, you
[2:09:06] give me a church here and a pastor and a
[2:09:08] family, Lord, and and and and and
[2:09:10] friends around the world, Lord. I thank
[2:09:13] you for it today, God, that choice. Now,
[2:09:16] Lord, maybe someone sitting here today,
[2:09:18] dear God, in this valley of decision,
[2:09:20] they got to make a choice, Father. Lord,
[2:09:23] may they make the choice of the word
[2:09:24] today, Lord, and five years from now or
[2:09:27] 10 years they reap the benefits of it.
[2:09:30] Dear God, come here as a reflection, a
[2:09:33] reflection of another world.
[2:09:36] In Jesus name I pray. In Jesus name I
[2:09:40] pray. I don't normally do this, but with
[2:09:42] every head bowed, every eye closed, I
[2:09:44] want to ask you to open your heart this
[2:09:46] morning, and I want to ask you to begin
[2:09:48] to use your voice in the sanctuary. And
[2:09:50] I want you to begin to pierce the
[2:09:52] atmosphere of unbelief around you. I
[2:09:55] want you to pierce the atmosphere of
[2:09:56] doubt. And I want you to pierce that
[2:09:58] atmosphere of nervousness right now with
[2:10:00] your own voice. And I want you to begin
[2:10:03] to thank God. I want maybe you want to
[2:10:06] stand up on your feet and raise your
[2:10:07] hands. That's fine. I want you to begin
[2:10:09] to worship the Lord all over this
[2:10:11] sanctuary. I want you to begin to
[2:10:14] magnify him. You say, "Preacher, you
[2:10:16] don't know what I've done this week and
[2:10:17] you don't know where I've been and you
[2:10:18] don't know what I've been involved in. I
[2:10:20] don't care about it this morning.
[2:10:22] Brother Andrew, I'm not worthy to open
[2:10:24] my voice. I'm not worthy to praise.
[2:10:26] We're not praising you this morning. I
[2:10:28] wonder would there be someone could say,
[2:10:30] "Lord, I thank you. I thank you for
[2:10:32] opening my eyes to this word. Lord, I
[2:10:35] thank you for the revelation that's come
[2:10:37] into my life. Lord, I thank you that I
[2:10:39] can see these things and I thank you I
[2:10:42] can hear these things. Lord, I wonder
[2:10:44] Grace Tabernacle." Could we open our
[2:10:46] hearts before God this morning and say,
[2:10:48] "Lord, I thank you for a church that
[2:10:50] preaches this message." And Lord, I
[2:10:52] thank you for eagles that gather here
[2:10:54] service after service. And when the word
[2:10:56] goes forth, there's something in their
[2:10:58] hearts to say, "Amen. I believe and I
[2:11:01] respond to it." Oh, hallelujah.
[2:11:04] Hallelujah. This morning, we ought to
[2:11:06] give him thanksgiving this morning. I
[2:11:08] think we ought to just open up our
[2:11:10] hearts and just allegiance to God all
[2:11:12] over again this morning. I love you,
[2:11:14] Lord. Maybe you're here this morning in
[2:11:17] a dark trial. I say there's an unseen
[2:11:19] world here to minister to you this
[2:11:21] morning. Maybe you're here and you're at
[2:11:23] a junction. You don't know which way to
[2:11:24] turn. You don't know where to go. I'm
[2:11:27] telling you this morning. Amen. Believe
[2:11:29] me. Believe the word I'm saying. Let it
[2:11:32] go this morning and begin to praise God.
[2:11:35] Oh, begin to worship the Lord this
[2:11:37] morning. Begin to thank the Lord this
[2:11:39] morning. Hallelujah. Hallelujah.
[2:11:43] Hallelujah. Hallelujah. Hallelujah.
[2:11:46] Maybe the word has corrected you this
[2:11:48] morning. And maybe maybe the word has
[2:11:50] shown you somewhere in your life that
[2:11:51] that the worldly influence has come and
[2:11:53] and maybe maybe you've gotten in the
[2:11:55] world order this morning somehow. You
[2:11:57] just go to church on Sunday and that's
[2:11:59] the only time you come. You don't come
[2:12:01] on Wednesdays. You don't come to prayer.
[2:12:03] You don't come to sing. You don't come
[2:12:05] to worship. You just come to church and
[2:12:07] then you go to work on Monday and you
[2:12:08] come back next Sunday. But would you
[2:12:10] believe me if I told you you were born
[2:12:12] to break that order this morning?
[2:12:14] Hallelujah. Hallelujah. Say, Lord, I
[2:12:17] want to break out of this world order
[2:12:18] today.
[2:12:20] I want to break out of it in the name of
[2:12:23] Jesus. In the name of Jesus.
[2:12:26] [Music]
[2:12:30] Oh,
[2:12:30] &gt;&gt; sing it this morning.
[2:12:34] &gt;&gt; I believe the Holy Ghost is here this
[2:12:36] morning.
[2:12:36] [Music]
[2:12:38] I believe he's dealing with hearts this
[2:12:39] morning.
[2:12:41] [Music]
[2:12:43] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:12:45] [Music]
[2:12:46] &gt;&gt; Lord, I thank you. You called me out of
[2:12:48] this world.
[2:12:51] &gt;&gt; Lord, don't ever let me get satisfied in
[2:12:53] it, Lord.
[2:12:55] &gt;&gt; Lord, don't ever let me get comfortable
[2:12:57] in this world.
[2:12:58] &gt;&gt; Oh, I do not know
[2:13:04] just how
[2:13:07] He came
[2:13:08] to love
[2:13:10] me so.
[2:13:14] Oh, but he looked beyond
[2:13:18] [Music]
[2:13:20] all my faults
[2:13:22] and he saw my needs.
[2:13:27] [Music]
[2:13:29] And I shall
[2:13:32] forever
[2:13:36] lift
[2:13:37] my eyes to Calary.
[2:13:44] Oh, to the cross
[2:13:50] where Jesus
[2:13:53] died for me.
[2:13:58] [Music]
[2:13:59] How long
[2:14:01] will
[2:14:03] [Music]
[2:14:05] the grace
[2:14:07] that call my falling
[2:14:11] soul?
[2:14:13] Oh, he loves
[2:14:16] me all
[2:14:19] my voice and he saw mine.
[2:14:25] Oh, second a verse now.
[2:14:28] Oh, it was God's grace
[2:14:34] that brought me out
[2:14:38] of darkness.
[2:14:40] [Applause]
[2:14:41] Oh,
[2:14:41] &gt;&gt; I wonder how many could help me worship
[2:14:43] him today.
[2:14:46] &gt;&gt; How many can just raise your hands in
[2:14:48] his presence today where I can
[2:14:51] &gt;&gt; Oh, I can clearly see,
[2:14:54] &gt;&gt; brother Morgan. We can clearly see
[2:14:56] today. Hallelujah.
[2:14:59] I'll shout it from the mountains.
[2:15:02] Hallelujah. Hallelujah. I'll shout it
[2:15:05] from the valleys.
[2:15:07] Hallelujah. Hallelujah.
[2:15:12] Thank you.
[2:15:15] [Music]
[2:15:18] My heart and he saw my seed. Hallelujah.
[2:15:24] Hallelujah. Hallelujah.
[2:15:27] And I shall
[2:15:29] forever
[2:15:33] live
[2:15:35] my life
[2:15:37] to that other world where I cross.
[2:15:41] Hallelujah.
[2:15:44] The crossing
[2:15:46] [Music]
[2:15:48] brother
[2:15:50] playing music.
[2:15:52] Seek it believers this morning.
[2:15:55] Hallelujah.
[2:15:59] [Music]
[2:15:59] [Applause]
[2:16:02] The grace that
[2:16:05] my holy
[2:16:08] soul
[2:16:13] behold
[2:16:16] all my heart and his soul.
[2:16:20] All sing that second now. Hallelujah.
[2:16:25] It was
[2:16:27] God's grace.
[2:16:29] &gt;&gt; Yes, it was that brought me out
[2:16:35] of dark.
[2:16:38] How many thanks him for that grace this
[2:16:39] morning into
[2:16:42] the light?
[2:16:45] Oh, where I
[2:16:48] can clear clear clearly see. I can see
[2:16:51] who I am in the word.
[2:16:52] &gt;&gt; Oh, you shout.
[2:16:53] &gt;&gt; I can see that I'm from another world.
[2:16:58] &gt;&gt; Glory.
[2:16:59] [Music]
[2:17:04] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Hallelujah. Hallelujah.
[2:17:08] Oh, he looked beyond
[2:17:13] all my faults,
[2:17:16] all my failures this morning and saw my
[2:17:19] need. Hallelujah. Hallelujah.
[2:17:23] And I shall glory.
[2:17:28] Oh, thank God you can do it this
[2:17:30] morning. Thank God you can look away to
[2:17:33] Jesus this morning.
[2:17:35] Thank God you got eyes to do it with
[2:17:38] this morning.
[2:17:39] Thank God you got eyes to see him.
[2:17:43] Hallelujah.
[2:17:45] Hallelujah. Hallelujah. Hallelujah.
[2:17:49] Glory.
[2:17:50] [Music]
[2:18:01] [Applause]
[2:18:01] [Music]
[2:18:10] Oh yes. All my faults and soul. Oh, I
[2:18:15] shall forever
[2:18:18] heart and I shall
[2:18:22] forever
[2:18:24] [Music]
[2:18:26] live
[2:18:27] my life to God.
[2:18:31] Glory, hallelujah
[2:18:34] to you. The cross
[2:18:39] where my Jesus
[2:18:42] died for me.
[2:18:49] How marvelous,
[2:18:52] how wonderful
[2:18:54] the grace that caught my falling
[2:18:59] soul.
[2:19:02] He looked beyond
[2:19:06] [Music]
[2:19:08] all my thoughts
[2:19:11] and saw
[2:19:13] my need.
[2:19:16] Oh, how many could raise your spiritual
[2:19:19] antennas this morning
[2:19:22] all over the building?
[2:19:25] You can just say, "Thank you, Lord.
[2:19:30] Thank you, Lord."
[2:19:33] Amen. I I know maybe some of you sitting
[2:19:36] here this morning and you say, "Brother
[2:19:37] Andrew, I don't understand these things.
[2:19:40] I don't have a clue about these things."
[2:19:43] Maybe some of you are just starting your
[2:19:45] walk in the Lord.
[2:19:47] But what if I told you this morning,
[2:19:50] gravitation holds your arms down. But a
[2:19:54] prophet said, "When you raise your
[2:19:55] hands, you break gravitation."
[2:19:58] And you raise your hands and and you
[2:20:00] say, "Lord, I thank you. Lord, I love
[2:20:03] you." Amen. Oh, I think it's just a
[2:20:07] spirit of thanksgiving in the building
[2:20:08] today.
[2:20:10] Lord, I thank you for allowing me to see
[2:20:12] these things.
[2:20:14] I thank you. I was elected to see it.
[2:20:17] Many people can look at the cross of
[2:20:19] Calvary today, brother, and they can't
[2:20:21] see what you see. They can look at it,
[2:20:24] Brother Travis, and they see it as 2,000
[2:20:26] years ago where as a historical
[2:20:29] happening, but there's a people on the
[2:20:31] earth today that says that one that was
[2:20:34] on the cross is the one that went to
[2:20:37] hell so I didn't have to go. And then
[2:20:40] that's the one who rose on that third
[2:20:43] day. And that's the one that's in my
[2:20:46] heart today. And he's the one that's
[2:20:48] bringing everything subject
[2:20:51] to this word. Hallelujah. What do you
[2:20:53] got on your heart this morning?
[2:20:58] &gt;&gt; Y'all got time to worship the Lord this
[2:21:00] morning? If anyone needs prayer, we're
[2:21:02] here to pray for you.
[2:21:05] &gt;&gt; I challenge you this morning, just close
[2:21:07] your eyes.
[2:21:08] Forget about who's around you.
[2:21:14] &gt;&gt; Just raise your hands. Just you showing
[2:21:16] the Lord.
[2:21:18] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:21:20] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:21:22] &gt;&gt; Oh yes.
[2:21:23] &gt;&gt; Oh no.
[2:21:27] &gt;&gt; Oh no. No saying goodbyes.
[2:21:32] Will there be spoken?
[2:21:39] And I won't
[2:21:42] [Applause]
[2:21:48] [Music]
[2:21:50] sing it now
[2:21:52] for you.
[2:21:58] [Music]
[2:21:59] Oh, I'm longing
[2:22:02] for
[2:22:04] you.
[2:22:07] Oh, handsome
[2:22:09] [Music]
[2:22:16] I'll stand
[2:22:22] and there my
[2:22:28] oh shall be
[2:22:31] eternal.
[2:22:36] Oh, the land
[2:22:42] sweet.
[2:22:44] [Music]
[2:22:50] I'm looking

[2:22:56] oh across
[2:22:58] that river
[2:23:02] [Music]

[2:24:20] shall be eternal.
[2:24:28] Yes. Beautiful.

[2:24:50] sad river.

[2:25:03] it's going to end
[2:25:05] inside.

[2:25:18] days to labor
[2:25:22] [Music]

[2:29:22] How many can say this morning, it's
[2:29:23] real.
[2:29:25] It's real.
[2:29:27] Almighty God, as your presence has been
[2:29:30] so rich among us and is still so rich,
[2:29:34] Lord, as the influence of that other
[2:29:36] dimension has come into this world
[2:29:39] through the preaching of the message of
[2:29:40] the hour, through the hearts of your
[2:29:43] elected believers seeing the things that
[2:29:45] you elected them to see.
[2:29:48] Lord, as we take these things into our
[2:29:51] hearts and Lord, as we feed upon them in
[2:29:54] the days to come, Father, I know the
[2:29:57] world right now is dark and it's bleak
[2:30:00] and you can't turn on the news without
[2:30:02] it being bad news, but oh, I'm so
[2:30:05] thankful this morning that we've heard
[2:30:07] the good news. I'm so thankful this
[2:30:10] morning for your grace that is so filled
[2:30:12] this place this morning. Now, Father, I
[2:30:15] pray today, Lord, that these believers
[2:30:17] under the sound of my voice will leave
[2:30:19] this sanctuary today, dear God, with the
[2:30:22] strongest connection.
[2:30:24] Hallelujah.
[2:30:26] With the strongest connection to that
[2:30:28] other world, and other dimension that
[2:30:30] they've ever had in their lives. Father,
[2:30:32] may they go home and begin to listen to
[2:30:34] sermons like things that are to be,
[2:30:37] future home, the rapture. Oh, may they
[2:30:40] begin to hear those things. And father,
[2:30:43] as they begin to hear those things and
[2:30:44] they begin to hear your prophet teach
[2:30:46] those things, Lord, it just strengthens
[2:30:49] that communication. Lord, it just
[2:30:51] strengthens that connection. Lord, it
[2:30:53] just causes that yearning in our souls
[2:30:56] to grow stronger for that land. Lord,
[2:30:59] it'll cause us, Lord, the more we hear
[2:31:01] about that land and that world, the more
[2:31:03] easier it is to give up things of this
[2:31:05] world. Now, Father, I pray a special
[2:31:07] blessing upon every believer here.
[2:31:10] Father, may you watch over our pastor
[2:31:11] while he's away. May you bring him back
[2:31:13] home safely to the flock. Lord, you see
[2:31:16] the meetings we have coming in just a
[2:31:18] few short weeks, Lord. Father, I pray
[2:31:20] that this anointing in this atmosphere,
[2:31:23] Lord, that we feel here this morning
[2:31:24] will just continually grow and become
[2:31:27] stronger and greater, Lord. Father, in
[2:31:29] these meetings, Lord, of believers
[2:31:31] coming together, Lord, I pray the power
[2:31:33] of God would move as never before.
[2:31:35] Father, may we begin to set ourselves
[2:31:37] aside, dear God, and focus on that other
[2:31:40] world to come into these meetings and
[2:31:42] minister, Lord. Now, Father, I pray you
[2:31:45] bless every believer here today. I thank
[2:31:47] you for them. I thank you for their
[2:31:49] testimony, Lord. I thank you for their
[2:31:51] witness, Lord, be with Brother Joel
[2:31:53] there, ministering in Manchester today.
[2:31:55] Bring him home safely to the church and
[2:31:57] his family, Lord. Father, all the men of
[2:32:00] God in this assembly. May you bless and
[2:32:02] bless their ministries. I pray in Jesus
[2:32:05] name.
[2:32:06] in Jesus name.
[2:32:08] My how do you end a service like this?
[2:32:11] There's no end to it because there's no
[2:32:14] end to us. Amen. Brother Wesley, there's
[2:32:18] no end to us. We're going all the way.
[2:32:21] Do you love him today?
[2:32:23] &gt;&gt; Amen. I want to say God bless you all.
[2:32:26] Amen. We love you. The love of the Lord,
[2:32:27] Brother Roy, Sister Judy, good to have
[2:32:28] you here this morning. Good to see you.
[2:32:30] We love Brother Roy and Sister Judy.
[2:32:32] Amen. Amen. I'll say pillars in this
[2:32:35] community for this message and we say
[2:32:37] God richly bless you all. Amen. All the
[2:32:39] other visitors, God bless you. Thank you
[2:32:41] for being in our gates today. Again, I
[2:32:43] just want to say from the bottom of my
[2:32:45] heart, I thank this church for all
[2:32:46] you've done for our family. Brother
[2:32:48] Matt, Sister Sarah, taking care of
[2:32:50] little man for a few days there for us
[2:32:52] and brother Xavier, Sister Jordan,
[2:32:54] Sister Destiny coming and staying. All
[2:32:56] all the meals, all the cooking,
[2:32:58] everything you've done for us. I feel
[2:32:59] like I'm leaving somebody out. So, from
[2:33:01] the bottom of my heart today, I say
[2:33:03] thank you. Amen. Thank you for all
[2:33:05] you've done for us. We love you the love
[2:33:07] of the Lord. Amen. How many say I'll see
[2:33:09] you in the rapture?
[2:33:11] &gt;&gt; Amen. How many will go home this week
[2:33:12] and feed on that other world?
[2:33:15] &gt;&gt; I wonder how many just say, "I'm not I'm
[2:33:17] not trying to put you on the spot, but
[2:33:18] how many say this week, I'm going to
[2:33:19] listen to things that are to be. I'm
[2:33:21] gonna listen to future home. I'm going
[2:33:23] to listen to the sermon, the rapture."
[2:33:25] Amen. I challenge you. Listen to that in
[2:33:27] order. future home, the rapture, things
[2:33:30] that are to be. Oh, it'll make you so
[2:33:32] sick of this world. Brother John, you're
[2:33:34] ready to go to that world. Amen. We love
[2:33:36] you this morning with the love of God.
[2:33:38] Why don't you turn and shake somebody's
[2:33:40] hand as you're dismissed this morning?
[2:33:42] Go in the fear of God. Amen.
[2:33:45] Until Wednesday night, may God richly
[2:33:47] bless you be our prayer.

[2:34:36] And I've got my mind made up. And I
[2:34:40] won't turn back because I won't see my
[2:34:44] Jesus someday.
