[0:48] He set me free. Oh, he broke the bonds
[0:52] of prison for me. And I'm glory bound,
[0:57] my Jesus to see. Oh, glory to God. Let's
[1:02] all stand and sing that first verse. But
[1:04] once like a burden in prison, I dwell.
[1:09] Oh, no. Freom from my sorrow I fell. But
[1:14] then Jesus came and he listened to me.
[1:18] And glory to God. Oh, he set me free.

[2:05] me free. He broke the bonds of prison
[2:10] for me. And I'm glory bound. My Jesus to
[2:15] see. Oh, glory to God.
[2:20] So, goodbye to sin and things that
[2:24] confound. Oh, not of this world shall
[2:28] turn me around. Oh, daily I'm working
[2:32] and I'm praying too. And glory to God,
[2:37] I'm going through. Oh, he set me free.
[2:41] Yes, he set me free. Oh, he broke the
[2:45] bond of risen for me. And I'm glory
[2:50] bound by Jesus to see. Yes. Glory to
[2:55] God. Oh, let's sing that third verse
[2:57] once more. Goodbye to sin and things
[3:01] that compound. Oh, not of this world

[3:09] working and I'm praying too. And glory
[3:13] to God, I'm going through. Oh, he set me
[3:18] free. Yes, he set me free. Oh, he broke
[3:23] the ground of risen for me and I'm glory
[3:28] bound by Jesus to see. Oh, glory to God.
[3:34] I'll sing the chorus once more. Oh, he
[3:37] set me free. Yes, he set me free. Oh, he
[3:41] broke the bonds of prison for me and I'm
[3:46] going my Jesus to see. Oh, glory to God.

[4:44] word would pull it out of us, Lord.
[4:46] that there's nothing keeping us from
[4:48] you, Lord. Father, I'm asking you, Lord,
[4:51] to anoint every part of your service,
[4:55] Lord, that we can worship you in spirit
[4:57] and in truth. Lord, bless the minister,
[5:00] Lord. Father God, that your word comes
[5:03] forth with power and demonstration.

[5:59] Oh, what a difference it makes when the
[6:02] Lord has his way. Oh, my life, praise
[6:05] God, has been changed.
[6:08] As though my sins were as scarlet,
[6:11] they're white as snow. I was bound, but
[6:14] today I am free.

[35:21] mean to open up?" He said, "Well, just
[35:23] try raising up your hands and praising
[35:24] him, saying, Lord, I thank you. You give
[35:27] me the promise. I'm going to hold to it.
[35:28] I thank you, Lord. I thank you." You
[35:30] want to open up to the Holy Spirit this
[35:32] morning, you can do it by the lifting of
[35:34] your hands. Won't somebody join me this
[35:36] morning? Say, "Lord, I want to welcome
[35:38] you here. I I thank you for what you've
[35:40] done for me. Lord, you're a great God.
[35:42] You're a miracle working God. Lord, I
[35:44] know I have needs this morning. I I come
[35:46] to you as a needy people, but Lord, we
[35:48] believe this morning that you're more
[35:50] than able. Won't you just lift to him
[35:52] and maybe out of your own mouth with
[35:54] your own voice to begin to speak to him
[35:56] and say, Lord, just approach him. Lord,
[35:59] I thank you for what you've done for me.
[36:01] Lord, I thank you, Lord, for being a
[36:02] great God. Lord, you're so good to me.
[36:05] Lord, you've never failed me. Lord,
[36:06] you're a merciful God. Lord, anytime
[36:09] I've been in need, Lord, you've came on
[36:11] the scene. Lord, you've met every need.
[36:12] And Lord, I come to worship you this
[36:14] morning. Lord, I thank you for all that
[36:16] you've done for me. Lord, I thank you
[36:18] for my family. Lord, I thank you for
[36:20] being in our midst this morning. Lord, I
[36:22] ask you, Lord, that you'd be welcome in
[36:24] this place. Lord, may I not hinder.
[36:26] Lord, you God, may you be welcome in my
[36:28] heart and in my life. Lord, may you move
[36:31] about this church this morning, God. May
[36:33] you have your way in this building,
[36:35] Lord. May you meet every need, Lord.
[36:37] Every hand that's raised, Lord, every
[36:39] every need, every sickness in the
[36:41] building, Lord, that you would have your
[36:42] way in this service, Lord. We invite you
[36:44] here this morning as a body of
[36:46] believers, Lord. We welcome you, Lord.
[36:49] God, we just ask you, Lord, to make
[36:50] yourself welcome, Lord. God, may you
[36:53] hear our praise and our worship, Lord.
[36:55] And may you be may it be a sweet
[36:58] smelling savor, Lord, to you, God. May
[37:01] you may you may it be honored to you,
[37:03] Lord. And may you receive it, Lord. We
[37:05] ask. In the name of Jesus Christ, we
[37:07] pray. Lord, we worship you. There is no
[37:11] one else like you.
[37:16] There is no one else like you. You are
[37:20] great.
[37:22] You do miracles so great.
[37:26] There's no one else like you.
[37:31] There is no one else like you. Can you
[37:37] sing it to me this morning? You are
[37:39] great.
[37:41] You do miracles so great.
[37:45] There is no one else like you. you.
[37:50] There is no one else like you. You are
[37:54] great.
[37:56] You do miracles so great. There is no
[38:00] one else like you.
[38:04] There is no one else like you.
[38:12] You deserve the glory
[38:16] and the honor.
[38:19] Yes, Lord. I lift my life to worship.
[38:23] How many to give their all to him now?
[38:26] Yes. You deserve the glory
[38:30] and the honor.
[38:33] So Lord, I want to give my life to
[38:37] worship, to magnify your name. You are
[38:42] great. You do miracles so great.
[38:47] There's no one else like you.
[38:52] There's no one else like you. You are
[38:56] great.
[38:58] You do miracles so great.
[39:01] There is no one else like you.
[39:06] There is no one else like you.
[39:14] If you really believe that this morning,
[39:15] won't you just give the Lord a hand clap
[39:17] of praise? He's a great God. Amen. You
[39:21] believe that? Amen. How many come ready
[39:23] to hear the word of the Lord? Amen. We
[39:26] come to have communion with God. And I
[39:28] just been having tremendous services.
[39:30] And brother Andrew Wednesday night was
[39:33] preaching on Rahabad the influencer. And
[39:35] I I've been feeding on that all week.
[39:37] And think the Old Testament's filled
[39:39] with influencers. There's some Old
[39:41] Testament influencers, but there's also
[39:43] some New Testament influencers. And I
[39:45] thank God that we can look across this
[39:47] building this morning and see
[39:48] influencers. I know the whole world's
[39:50] looking to influence somebody, but the
[39:53] question is, what are they influencing
[39:54] them to? But we've got something that we
[39:56] can be an influence that can bring
[39:58] people to something that would change
[40:00] their life forever. Very, it don't
[40:02] matter how bad off it is or what kind of
[40:04] needs they have. I thank God that we
[40:05] have a place to bring people to. Amen.
[40:08] Do you believe that this morning? Amen.
[40:10] How many come ready to hear the word?
[40:11] Amen. How many loves the word? Amen. We
[40:14] got brother Nathan Ericson with us this
[40:17] morning. He's never spoke for us. This
[40:19] will be a first time to have him here.
[40:21] and uh he's an associate minister at
[40:23] brother Wayne's uh church. His dad
[40:25] actually been pastor there for many
[40:27] grandpa for many many years and and uh

[40:50] of our young folks go to the the camp
[40:52] there at at True Word Tabernacle and So,
[40:55] uh, we appreciate him coming. His wife's

[41:09] singing for us. What a what a special
[41:11] gift. Amen. And we sure appreciate our
[41:15] visitors here this morning.
[41:18] Amen. But we just want to make them
[41:20] welcome and just allow the Lord to have
[41:22] time to come and speak to our heart. And
[41:24] how many believe that God is more than
[41:26] able to do that? Amen. How many can pull
[41:28] from a gift of God and just lay
[41:30] everything else aside and just have a
[41:32] good time in the Lord this morning?
[41:33] Amen. Is that your is that your heart's
[41:35] desire? Amen. Can we sing the goodness
[41:37] of God as we invite our brother to come?
[41:40] I love you, Lord.
[41:45] Oh, your mercy never fails me.
[41:51] And all my days
[41:53] I've been held in your hands.
[41:58] From the moment that I wake up
[42:02] till I lay my head,
[42:06] I will sing of the goodness of God.
[42:13] So I say
[42:16] all my life you have been faithful. Yes.
[42:23] All my life you have been so so good.
[42:30] With every breath that I am made,
[42:34] [Music]
[42:36] I will sing of the goodness.
[42:41] [Music]
[42:43] I will sing of the goodness.
[42:48] May we can sing that second verse. I
[42:50] love your voice.
[42:54] You have led me through the fire
[42:59] in darkest night. You are close like
[43:07] I've known you as a father.
[43:10] I've known you as a friend.
[43:14] I have lived in the goodness of God.
[43:20] [Music]
[43:24] All my life you have been faithful.
[43:28] Oh yes, Lord. Oh my life you have been
[43:34] so so good
[43:38] with every breath that I have made.
[43:42] Oh. Oh. I will sing of the goodness of
[43:48] God.
[43:51] I will sing of the goodness of God.
[43:58] Amen. Isn't he a good God this morning?
[44:01] Amen. God bless you all. It's really,
[44:03] really special to be here. It's kind of
[44:05] long overdue uh coming down to
[44:07] fellowship with you. My wife's been
[44:09] quite a few times and I just always uh
[44:12] mean to come to your meetings and intend
[44:13] or we we either have to cover at home or
[44:15] something has happened and so long
[44:17] overdue coming down to fellowship with
[44:19] you. But it means a lot, brother Matt,
[44:21] to have the invite. We're down in this
[44:23] part of the country for a wedding and
[44:24] the family down in Texar Cana and so
[44:27] brother Matt was gracious to extend an
[44:28] invitation me and my family's here
[44:31] again. Brother Kyle, sister Lindsay and
[44:34] uh so it's just we we're just honored to
[44:37] be here. We want to bring greetings from
[44:38] home from of course from the saints
[44:40] there at Shrew Tabernacle in Ohio and
[44:43] Brother Wayne of course and I know
[44:45] brother Wayne's got very deep roots here
[44:47] family and loved ones and and friends
[44:50] and so uh we appreciate brother Wayne we
[44:52] appreciate the Lord for sending him up
[44:54] our way to be our pastor. We're just so
[44:56] blessed but then through that getting to
[44:58] meet all of you and and make some
[45:00] connections here and friendships and
[45:02] have your young people come up for our
[45:03] banquet and our youth camp and
[45:04] everything. That's just the That's just
[45:06] the icing on the cake. Amen. So, we
[45:08] appreciate the fellowship. I know that
[45:10] you're I know the people here. I don't
[45:12] usually uh I try not to admit it all the
[45:14] time, but I'm a little nervous today
[45:16] because I know that you as people,
[45:18] you're just very important to Brother
[45:19] Wayne. So, therefore, you're very
[45:20] important to me, this assembly, this
[45:22] church. We're just glad to see how the
[45:24] Lord's blessing. But far and above that,
[45:26] you're important to the Lord. Amen. So,
[45:29] we just want to be a blessing to you
[45:30] today. Try to be an encouragement. Say,
[45:32] "God bless you." Amen. Just just an
[45:35] honor again to be here. Why don't we
[45:37] just go to the word of God, Matthew
[45:39] chapter 6.
[45:53] The weather here has been a little rough
[45:56] on a Michigan boy.
[45:58] We're going to have to toughen up.
[46:02] Amen. I'd like to just uh read a read a
[46:05] little passage here in the scripture.
[46:07] Matthew 6 verses 25 down to 29.
[46:11] Jesus says, "Therefore I say unto you,
[46:14] take no thought for your life what ye
[46:16] shall eat or what you shall drink, nor
[46:19] yet for your body what you shall put on.
[46:21] Is not the life more than meat and the
[46:24] body than raignment. Behold the fowls of
[46:27] the air, for they sow not, neither do
[46:29] they reap, nor gather into barns, yet
[46:32] your heavenly father feedth them. That's
[46:34] an amazing type there. I I I want to
[46:36] focus though on this on this next part.
[46:39] He says, "Are you not much better than
[46:40] they? Which of you by taking thought
[46:43] could add one cubit unto his stature?
[46:46] And why take ye thought for raignment?
[46:48] Consider the liies." That's what I'd
[46:50] like to do today is consider the lily.
[46:52] Consider the liies of the field, how
[46:54] they grow. They toil not, neither do
[46:57] they spin. And yet I say unto you that
[46:59] even Solomon in all his glory was not a
[47:01] raid like one of these. Amen. Let's just
[47:04] have a word of prayer. Heavenly Father,
[47:06] Lord, as we would just consider, Lord,
[47:09] the the the image, Lord, that your word
[47:11] was set before us, I just pray, Lord,
[47:13] that you would come take this service in
[47:16] your hands, Lord, and make it what you
[47:17] want it to be, Father. Lord, we're just
[47:20] like those little sparrows, Lord. We
[47:22] have no power to sew or power to reap,
[47:24] Father, or even to feed ourselves, but
[47:26] we're just dependent on your provision
[47:28] today, Lord. And I pray that the Holy
[47:30] Ghost would just come, Father. Indwell
[47:32] this service, Lord. May you anoint these
[47:34] lips to speak, anoint the ears of the
[47:36] hearer as well, Father, just from the
[47:38] start to the finish, Lord. Would you
[47:40] take complete control, Lord? We're we're
[47:42] your bride, Father. That's our desire
[47:44] above all things to do your will,
[47:46] Father. We're not here, Lord, to just
[47:48] bring forth a pretty sermon, Lord, or or
[47:50] or or pretty words, Father. But we just
[47:53] want you to come and inhabit our praise
[47:55] today, Father. Come amongst us in a
[47:57] personal way. Speak to hearts, Lord.
[47:59] Encourage us and edify us from your
[48:01] word. I pray just take it in your hands,
[48:03] Lord, in Jesus name. Amen. God bless you
[48:06] as you're seated today. Uh just just
[48:09] some simple things on my heart today uh
[48:11] to share with you. uh some things I've
[48:13] just been finding inspiration in from
[48:15] the scriptures and and uh by the way
[48:18] it's good to see all my nieces and
[48:19] nephews here and uh feeling feeling
[48:23] helping me feel at home today. I I want
[48:25] to consider the lily you know and and uh
[48:27] and and and uh it takes sometimes uh we
[48:30] know that brother Brandon would say that
[48:32] God hides himself in simplicity. He
[48:34] hides himself in things that are simple.
[48:36] Well, but just because something is
[48:38] simple doesn't mean it's not deep. Is
[48:40] that right? It doesn't mean there's not
[48:41] it's not profound or that it's trivial
[48:44] or it's something you can just absorb
[48:46] really quickly. And a lily is kind of
[48:48] one of those things. Brother Bram said
[48:50] one in the message, God hiding himself
[48:51] in simplicity. He said that a man could
[48:53] sit down. I think this is amazing. He
[48:54] could sit down and look at a bunch of
[48:56] flowers, a bouquet, and and he could
[48:59] study that 30 minutes. He said,
[49:00] sincerely with all of his heart and know
[49:02] more about God than if than if he had
[49:05] all the degrees that a Bible school
[49:07] could give him. for God reveals himself
[49:10] in the flower. So, I think it'd be worth
[49:12] our time maybe this morning to take a
[49:14] little time and and consider the lily.
[49:16] Amen. Uh, you know, Brother Brandon
[49:17] would talk about a sermon that he he
[49:19] must have been one of his favorites
[49:20] because he referred to it often early in
[49:22] his ministry. He preached a sermon
[49:23] called Reverend Mr. Lily. I may have
[49:25] heard of him speak about it. And uh and
[49:28] you know uh and so there is a sermon in
[49:30] this flower. He would say that the and
[49:33] the story of this flower is the story of
[49:35] an overcomer. And it's the story of an
[49:37] overcomer. It's the story of a
[49:38] Christian. You'll notice that the story
[49:40] of a lily is not a story that can be
[49:42] told just in the springtime. It's not a
[49:44] story that you can tell in the winter,
[49:46] but it's a seasonal uh there's a
[49:48] seasonal expression to a flower. And
[49:51] it's the same with a Christian life. Uh
[49:53] you know, uh we just uh we get spring a
[49:55] little bit later than you do in Ohio.
[49:57] So, we're we're still kind of just
[49:58] coming on the tail end of that season.
[50:00] And after you come out of a few cold,
[50:02] gray winter months, you know, and that
[50:04] first time that you look at a flower and
[50:06] you realize spring has arrived, that's a
[50:08] that's a powerful moment, you know, and
[50:10] and you can look at the we got a family
[50:12] in our church that has a a greenhouse
[50:14] and and so we were there for opening day
[50:16] and seen all these beautiful flowers
[50:17] that they had. And you look at that
[50:19] flower and how that it has a fragrance
[50:21] and there's a value to it. It has
[50:23] something that it expresses a a beauty
[50:25] and a smell and all that. And you look
[50:27] at that and you you would ask yourself
[50:28] say, "Man, that that's something
[50:30] amazing. Now, how could I acquire that?
[50:32] How could I get a hold of that? How
[50:34] could I have something like that for
[50:35] myself?" Well, I guess we're going to
[50:37] preach on a lily. You got to start at
[50:38] the beginning. You're going to have to
[50:40] start with a seed. You can't you can't
[50:42] skip to the end. You can't you can't
[50:44] skip from, you know, spring to fall. You
[50:46] have to you have to start with a seed,
[50:48] right? It's the same with the Christian
[50:50] life. You know, a a young person will
[50:51] look at people around them in the church
[50:53] and people that we look up to as heroes
[50:55] and ministry that has the rule over us
[50:57] and that we admire and we benefit from.
[50:59] And you look at you look at there's
[51:01] people in your life you look at and you
[51:02] see there's a beauty coming out of that
[51:04] life. Amen. Just laying a foundation
[51:06] here. Just stick with me. There's a
[51:08] beauty there. There's a fragrance.
[51:09] There's something being expressed out of
[51:11] that life that is beautiful to you. And
[51:13] you say, "Well, you know, but how could
[51:15] I have that? How could I produce that?
[51:17] How could I, you know, get a hold of
[51:19] that in my own life? It's the exact same
[51:21] way, brother, sister. It doesn't happen
[51:22] overnight. It's not something you can
[51:24] just skip to. Uh there's a process to
[51:26] it. There's a season to it. But it all
[51:28] starts right here with a little seed.
[51:30] Amen. It's the seed of God's
[51:32] predestination by by election grace that
[51:35] God put a seed in a in a in a person.
[51:38] Amen. That no matter what kind of
[51:39] conditions they're laying in, there's a
[51:41] potential in them. Amen. that given time
[51:43] and atmosphere, the seed that's in that
[51:45] person is going to come out and it's
[51:47] going to blossom one day and something's
[51:49] going to come out of that person that
[51:50] God wanted to be there before the
[51:52] beginning. Amen. But but we got to start
[51:54] with a seed, friends. And you know,
[51:55] that's why we preach so much on the
[51:57] quickening power. That's why that's why
[51:59] the message focuses so much on on this
[52:01] uh you all know the phrase of the
[52:03] quickening power of God. I think some
[52:06] people around our message ranks that
[52:07] kind of get the idea sometimes that that
[52:09] you know evangelists kind of want to get
[52:11] in the pulpit and and and uh and that
[52:13] well they just want to get everybody
[52:14] excited and they want to start talking
[52:16] about power just kind of work people up
[52:17] and get everybody shouting and feel like
[52:19] they did a good job preaching. But
[52:21] there's something a lot deeper to it
[52:23] brother sister than that. Amen. This
[52:24] message is full of quickening power and
[52:27] and quickening power is what you got to
[52:29] have for a seed to ever come to life.
[52:32] Amen. And that that that that's why we
[52:34] preach on it. That's why that's why we
[52:35] push that's why that's why as far as we
[52:37] come with the message, we still preach
[52:39] the good oldfashioned baptism of the
[52:41] Holy Ghost, the new birth, the moving of
[52:43] the spirit, the atmosphere of the
[52:45] presence of God. Amen. Because you've
[52:46] got to have that quickening power if you
[52:48] ever want to bring a seed to life. Amen.
[52:51] And that's that's that's that's what I
[52:53] believe is that a a seed is not truly
[52:55] born. You you talk about how does a lily
[52:57] come to be? Well, a seed is not born
[52:59] just when it falls from the branch of
[53:01] parentage. When a when an acorn falls
[53:03] off an oak tree, that's not the that's
[53:05] not the birth of a tree. Because that
[53:08] acorn might lay there in the ground for
[53:10] a long time. It'll lay there dormant.
[53:12] There will be no life in it. You can put
[53:14] it everywhere you want. Amen. But until
[53:16] that seed is quickened, amen, it'll
[53:18] never bring forth a tree. How many knows
[53:20] that, right? And then you can put
[53:22] somebody in a church, even a message
[53:24] church, you can dress them upright. You
[53:26] can get them talking. You can make them
[53:27] quote the quotes. They can sing the
[53:29] right songs. Amen. They can believe God
[53:31] sent a prophet, but the devil believes
[53:32] God sent a prophet. And so just because
[53:35] we got people in our church doesn't mean
[53:37] we got them to the quickening power.
[53:39] Brother Brandham said, "Are we really
[53:40] getting people to Christ or are we just
[53:42] getting them to church?" Now, he said,
[53:44] "If we get them to church, that's good."
[53:46] Praise the Lord. That's good. But we got
[53:48] to get them beyond the church and get
[53:50] the people to Christ where there's
[53:52] quickening power. Amen. And I believe
[53:54] the message is full of quickening power.
[53:56] I believe there's so much power in this
[53:58] message that it doesn't matter how what
[54:00] a dark condition you're laying in. It
[54:02] doesn't matter how filthy your life is,
[54:04] what kind of a background you came out
[54:05] of. Amen. If you could ever get
[54:07] quickened, Amen. by the life of Jesus
[54:10] Christ that's being expressed through
[54:11] the message of the hour. Amen. You'll
[54:13] come up out of that as sure as anything.
[54:16] Amen. Because it's a because that's
[54:18] Amen. what the quickening power is for.
[54:20] It's to find a humble little seed down
[54:22] in a dark place somewhere. Amen. And
[54:24] change it. Amen. Now, when that seed is
[54:27] changed, when it's quickened, it's not
[54:28] always a great big explosion. It's not
[54:31] You might not always notice it. You may
[54:32] not notice something the next day or the
[54:34] next week or even the next month. Amen.
[54:36] But if it ever gets quickened, brother,
[54:38] from that time, nothing will ever be the
[54:40] same. Amen. Is that right? And I believe
[54:43] that I believe, friends, that the
[54:45] message is full of quickening power. I
[54:48] think uh you know I I don't believe that
[54:50] we've come so far and we got so
[54:51] revelated and we have such a such a
[54:54] great understanding of the message that
[54:55] uh that that as many have made the case
[54:57] that we don't need the baptism of the
[54:59] Holy Ghost anymore. We don't need this
[55:00] oldtime religion. We don't need a bunch
[55:02] of shouting and carrying on and dancing
[55:04] and all these kind of things. We don't
[55:06] need the moving of the spirit in the
[55:07] church cuz we've got the word and we're
[55:09] a mature church. Amen. But you know a
[55:12] mature church if you take a mature plan.
[55:15] Amen. How many believe the bride is
[55:16] coming into a season of maturity? Amen.
[55:19] But a mature tree is not a tree that's
[55:21] dried up and cut down and laying down
[55:23] and ready to be burned into firewood.
[55:25] Amen. A mature tree is a tree that's
[55:28] ready, amen, to drop fruit, amen, that
[55:31] can reproduce the life that's in it. And
[55:33] I pray we never get so far in this
[55:36] church or my church or any message
[55:38] church. Amen. Till we get away from the
[55:40] quickening power. I believe a mature
[55:42] bride is a bride that's ready to bring
[55:44] forth new life. That's real maturity.
[55:47] Amen. If we're ever going to bring in
[55:49] that last seed and take a rapture, we've
[55:51] got to have the quickening power. Amen.
[55:53] It ought to be common in our ranks. For
[55:55] a young person to get the baptism of the
[55:57] Holy Ghost. For a life to be changed.
[56:00] Amen. For old habits to die. Amen. For
[56:02] the sick to be healed. Amen. For the
[56:04] power of God to be on display amongst
[56:07] his people. We believe in the quickening
[56:09] power. I know you believe that. Amen. I
[56:11] believe that too. Everything, See,
[56:13] Brother Brham would say that that's what
[56:14] really that's the real really what a
[56:16] seed is. It's not what you see on the
[56:18] outside because everything on the
[56:19] outside of that seed is just a dead
[56:22] husk. Amen. It's just a dead husk. Amen.
[56:25] And and and uh you know, you could take
[56:26] a person, you can pretty them up real
[56:28] good, dress them nice. Amen. Get them to
[56:30] observe the dress code and get them to
[56:32] quote the right quotes and all those
[56:34] kind of things. But it's it's a husk,
[56:36] friends. Unless there's a quicken,
[56:38] unless there's a little little uh
[56:40] awakening of life on the inside of that
[56:42] person, they're just as dead as they can
[56:44] be. But if they ever meet the quickening
[56:46] power, Amen. Nothing will ever be the
[56:50] same. Amen. I I've been preaching a
[56:52] little minieries at home on on the
[56:54] lifeline. And Amen. That that's what I
[56:56] believe is that is that uh is that life
[56:58] when it comes to maturity, life, Amen.
[57:01] at a state of maturity is life which is
[57:03] ready to reproduce itself. Amen. And I I
[57:06] I pray friends that we'll always have an
[57:08] atmosphere for birth where the message
[57:11] of the hour is preached. Notice how
[57:13] brother Brandham, the rising of the sun,
[57:14] he would speak to his own church now and
[57:17] he would he would warn him about, you
[57:18] know, the deception of looking at this
[57:21] husk on the outside, this religious husk
[57:23] that we all carry around. He said, "Is
[57:26] there one here in this?" He said, "Who
[57:28] doesn't have this quickening power in
[57:30] you? The sun has shined across you." He
[57:32] said, "You've sit in this tabernacle."
[57:34] He's talking about brand tabernacle
[57:35] here. You've listened to tapes, but the
[57:38] spirit has never quickened you to follow
[57:41] the word of God. That's what the
[57:42] quickening power do. Make you follow the
[57:44] word of God. Oh, he said that's a
[57:46] dangerous thing. What if you would be a
[57:48] dead seed? No life in you. I think
[57:51] brother Bram said one time, the most
[57:52] dangerous the most the greatest
[57:54] deception is to think you're a Christian
[57:56] and not be right. Amen. Uh but but he
[57:59] said, "What if you would be a dead seed
[58:01] with no life in you?" It's a it's a
[58:02] dangerous thing. But he said, "Oh, but
[58:05] there's something in you that tells you,
[58:07] I want to rise. I want to rise this
[58:10] morning. I want to rise from the state
[58:12] that I'm in. I don't want to just be a
[58:14] dead seed and and be left to dirt and
[58:16] driftwood. I want to rise, friend."
[58:18] Amen. How many hear that little voice on
[58:20] the inside of you? Now, now, let's just
[58:22] focus on that right now. Let's forget
[58:24] about what what you're struggling with
[58:26] today. what the circumstances of your
[58:28] life or what's been going on around in
[58:30] your home and in your life and in your
[58:32] workplace and whatever wherever you're
[58:34] at in this moment. Amen. Let's put that
[58:36] to the side today and just focus on that
[58:39] little voice on the inside. Something in
[58:41] you, your life today, I don't know who
[58:42] all I'm preaching to. Your life might be
[58:44] a mess this morning. You might be you
[58:46] might just be in a in a in a terrible
[58:48] state like your life is falling apart.
[58:50] But let me tell you, if there's a little
[58:52] voice way down on the inside of you,
[58:55] something in you saying, "Hey, I wasn't
[58:57] born for this. There's something more
[58:59] for me. There's got to be a higher state
[59:01] of being than this." There there's
[59:02] something in me saying, "I want to rise.
[59:05] I want to rise out of where I'm at. I
[59:07] want to get to a higher place. I want to
[59:09] be further on the other side of this
[59:11] service than I was when I came in."
[59:13] Brother, if you got that little voice on
[59:15] the inside of you, you might be the
[59:17] weakest Christian in the building, but
[59:18] you got power. Amen. Because anybody
[59:21] that's got a seed in them has got power.
[59:23] It's a very kind of special power. I
[59:25] know the word of God is full of power.
[59:27] Amen. We got power to heal. We got power
[59:29] to cast out devils. We got power, amen,
[59:32] to perform miracles and all these kind
[59:33] of works. But I want to talk about a
[59:35] different kind of power today. Maybe
[59:37] I'll I'd be bold enough to say the most
[59:39] in important kind of power to a
[59:41] Christian. Power to become. That's the
[59:44] power that's in a seed. Amen. A seed. It
[59:46] don't matter what it looks like right
[59:48] now. It's got a power to become
[59:51] something greater in the future than
[59:53] what it is right now. Amen. And anybody
[59:56] that's a predestinated seed of God.
[59:58] Amen. Don't look at the outside, but
[1:00:00] listen to that seed on the inside crying
[1:00:02] out for more. And you realize there's a
[1:00:04] power in you, brother, sister. Amen. To
[1:00:06] become something like you never dreamed.
[1:00:09] Amen. To experience things in the Lord
[1:00:10] like you never imagined. Amen. To rise
[1:00:13] higher than you ever thought was
[1:00:15] possible. Power to become. That's that's
[1:00:17] why something in you wants to rise.
[1:00:19] Amen. Because there's a law in a seed
[1:00:22] that's in effect. Amen. How many know
[1:00:25] that a seed is the encapsulation of
[1:00:27] God's law.
[1:00:29] I It's a law, friends. It's a law that
[1:00:31] God put in place in Genesis when God
[1:00:33] created all things. Amen. He he he
[1:00:37] created it through planting seeds in
[1:00:39] this earth. And when he but but when he
[1:00:42] planted a seed, it might have been a
[1:00:44] little little little bitty acorn, right?
[1:00:47] But when he planted it, he planted it
[1:00:49] and put a law in that seed. He said,
[1:00:52] "Let every seed bring forth of its own
[1:00:55] kind." Now, that's a law, brother,
[1:00:58] sister. That's not a hope. That's not a
[1:01:00] most of the time. That was God's law of
[1:01:03] Genesis to make a law that said, "Let
[1:01:05] every seed, whatever kind of life is in
[1:01:07] a seed." That's the only kind of life
[1:01:09] that can come out of it. No matter what
[1:01:12] it looks like, Amen. You can't measure
[1:01:13] an acorn against an oak tree. Amen.
[1:01:16] Because the oak because the acorn has
[1:01:18] the same life that the oak tree does.
[1:01:20] Amen. It just needs to go through a
[1:01:21] process. Amen. Oh my. And so so he
[1:01:25] brought it all under a law. He said,
[1:01:26] "Let every seed bring forth of its own
[1:01:28] kind." Now, are you ready for some deep
[1:01:30] teaching this morning? Ever since God
[1:01:32] put this law into place in Genesis, dog
[1:01:36] has never had
[1:01:38] Anybody ever seen it? Anybody ever seen
[1:01:41] a cat have puppies? It's never happened.
[1:01:44] It's never failed one time. It's never
[1:01:47] gone wrong one time. Every time, Amen. A
[1:01:50] seed that God created brings forth and
[1:01:53] reproduces itself. It can only bring
[1:01:56] forth the same life as what it came
[1:01:59] from. Brother, sister. Amen. And now you
[1:02:02] could put a lot of time studying it. You
[1:02:04] It's real deep. You could spend a lot of
[1:02:06] time trying to wrap your mind around
[1:02:08] process. And it's a it's a miracle of
[1:02:10] life. And you know, people put billions
[1:02:12] of dollars into this into like a in
[1:02:15] agriculture and the planting of food and
[1:02:17] and and orchards and things like that.
[1:02:20] Oh my. They they study it and they and
[1:02:23] they put money into developing it and
[1:02:25] they they they they mess with the
[1:02:27] chemistry and they Amen. and they they
[1:02:28] they they get in and try to hybrid
[1:02:30] things. They do Amen. There's so much
[1:02:32] science and so much technology and so
[1:02:34] much research that goes in Amen. to
[1:02:37] understanding this process of life
[1:02:40] bringing forth life. But at the end of
[1:02:42] the day, you know what happens, brother?
[1:02:44] Amen. A farmer goes out in the field. He
[1:02:45] puts a seed in the ground and he lets
[1:02:47] law God's law happen. You can't reach
[1:02:50] down and try to pull a sprout out of the
[1:02:52] seed. And you can't pull a tree out of
[1:02:54] the sprout. It's got to happen according
[1:02:56] to God's law. Amen. But if God's law
[1:02:58] doesn't fail, Amen. So all you got to do
[1:03:01] is find out what kind of seed it is. And
[1:03:03] if you got a hold of that, Amen. then
[1:03:05] your worry is over. Amen. You don't plan
[1:03:08] a field of corn and go out and say, "I
[1:03:10] hope I don't end up with soybeans. I
[1:03:12] hope I don't end up with raspberries."
[1:03:14] No, you planted a corn. And there's a
[1:03:16] law in a seed of corn. Amen. that corn
[1:03:18] is the only thing it can produce. And
[1:03:21] when God planted a seed word in the
[1:03:23] layout of sea and age when God sent a
[1:03:26] spoken word, original seed message,
[1:03:30] he wasn't worried what he would get, but
[1:03:33] he put a law in the seed of his word
[1:03:35] that it would bring forth exactly what
[1:03:37] he wanted it to be. Hey man, brother
[1:03:41] Brand preached a message, God's power to
[1:03:42] transform, and it's it's quite powerful.
[1:03:44] You know, I I I studied it one time and
[1:03:47] I it kind of caught me off guard
[1:03:48] because, you know, I studied I wanted to
[1:03:50] understand God's transforming power and
[1:03:52] I went and studied this message and all
[1:03:54] brother Brandham talks about almost is a
[1:03:56] seed.
[1:03:58] But when you get it, brother, it's
[1:04:00] powerful. Brother Brham would say when
[1:04:02] he put the seed in the earth, the seed
[1:04:04] can only come forth with the power of
[1:04:06] life within it. I love that. to
[1:04:09] transform it from a seed to a plant or
[1:04:12] whatever it was. His transforming power.
[1:04:16] Now, God put the seed in there with
[1:04:17] potentials that it would be what he said
[1:04:20] it would be. And as long as it stayed in
[1:04:23] its right category, it would be just
[1:04:25] exactly what God said it would be. It
[1:04:27] had to be that way because he had made
[1:04:30] it that way. God made a channel and he
[1:04:32] said, "And anything that stays in his
[1:04:34] channel, in his line of word, it'll have
[1:04:37] to bring forth." exactly like his word
[1:04:40] said it would do. So, what we're finding
[1:04:42] out, brothers and sisters, that we're
[1:04:43] dealing with a law, and I I'm an
[1:04:45] engineer by trade. I like God's laws
[1:04:47] because when you find out it's a law,
[1:04:49] you know, it'll work the same time every
[1:04:51] time. It'll work same way every time.
[1:04:54] Amen. So, so you know, gravity, it works
[1:04:56] the same way every time. That's why I
[1:04:58] can make a lever and I can lift up
[1:05:00] something heavy because it works the
[1:05:02] same way every time. Amen. and uh uh uh
[1:05:04] uh uh you know uh uh buoyancy and and
[1:05:06] hydraulics, they work the same way every
[1:05:08] time. So, you know, you could take a
[1:05:10] little tube like that and lift up a big
[1:05:12] skid loader or something. Amen. Because
[1:05:14] it works the same way every time. Once
[1:05:16] you find out you're dealing with a law,
[1:05:17] you don't have to worry about it. Takes
[1:05:19] the question out of it. Amen. And you
[1:05:22] know you the problem is we question what
[1:05:24] God's doing. We question his purpose.
[1:05:27] But I want you to understand God trusts
[1:05:29] his own law. Amen. And God's not worried
[1:05:31] about it. Brother, continuing the quote,
[1:05:34] "God said it's all good, so I'll just
[1:05:38] rest." And brother Brandham said, "Each
[1:05:40] one of those seeds, listen now, has
[1:05:43] power in itself to transform itself into
[1:05:47] the species that I desire it to be.
[1:05:51] That's what it must be because I have
[1:05:54] given every seed transforming power to
[1:05:57] make out of itself in its potentials to
[1:06:00] make of itself exactly what I want it to
[1:06:03] be. Say, "Brother Nathan, I need some
[1:06:05] transforming power today. I need my
[1:06:07] attitude transformed. I need some of my
[1:06:10] habits transformed. I need my I need my
[1:06:12] heart transformed. I need my body
[1:06:14] transformed." Amen, friends. Amen. And
[1:06:17] God gave you transforming power when he
[1:06:19] put a seed of predestination in you.
[1:06:22] Don't wait for it to fall out of the
[1:06:23] skies. Don't wait for the power you're
[1:06:25] looking for to come out of the heavens
[1:06:27] somewhere. God put power in you, power
[1:06:30] to become, power to be more than you
[1:06:32] ever imagined. Amen. Whatever you think
[1:06:35] your potential is as a as a son of
[1:06:38] daughter of God for this age, as a
[1:06:40] member of the bride of Jesus Christ,
[1:06:41] throw out your idea
[1:06:44] and learn how to trust God's law. Amen.
[1:06:47] As scripture now, John 1 says, "As many
[1:06:49] as received Christ, to them gave he
[1:06:51] power to become the sons of God." That's
[1:06:54] God's power to transform is by the seed.
[1:06:58] It's by the seed. I'll put it simply
[1:07:00] like this. When God plants a seed, God
[1:07:02] expects a blossom.
[1:07:04] God expects a blossom. Now, Isaiah 55
[1:07:06] would teach us this. He says, "As the
[1:07:08] rain cometh down," how many, that's a
[1:07:10] familiar scripture. He said, "The rain
[1:07:12] comes down, it gives seed to the sewer
[1:07:14] and bread to the eater." Amen. Notice
[1:07:16] now the same the same rain gives seed
[1:07:19] and bread.
[1:07:22] Now, there's a process of a seed
[1:07:24] becoming bread. Amen. But look, it's all
[1:07:28] the same life. Amen. But it's just the
[1:07:30] process. But it's the same rain at the
[1:07:32] same Holy Spirit that baptized you with
[1:07:34] the Holy Ghost is the same Holy Spirit
[1:07:36] that'll lead you to your adoption. It's
[1:07:38] the same life. There's a law to it,
[1:07:40] friends. He planted a seed and then God
[1:07:43] stopped worrying about it. We're the
[1:07:44] ones that worry about our future. We
[1:07:46] worry about whether we can make it. We
[1:07:48] worry about whether we really get the
[1:07:49] goods. Amen. But but Brother Bam said
[1:07:52] when God gave you the Holy Ghost and
[1:07:54] quickened that seed within you, he put
[1:07:56] in there everything that you need for
[1:07:58] life's journey.
[1:08:00] It's all in the seed.
[1:08:02] Amen. He said, "It goes out of my mouth,
[1:08:04] and it shall not return unto me void,
[1:08:07] but it will accomplish what I please,
[1:08:09] and it'll prosper in the thing whereto I
[1:08:12] sent it." I believe, how many believe
[1:08:13] God sent a message of adoption in this
[1:08:15] day? Amen. And I believe if God sent a
[1:08:18] message of adoption, he's expecting
[1:08:19] manifested sons. That's what God's
[1:08:22] expecting. We get a little worried about
[1:08:23] it. We start looking around at church
[1:08:25] issues and we look around the message
[1:08:27] communities and we see false teachings
[1:08:29] and we see little isms rising up and we
[1:08:31] see drama and we see family problems and
[1:08:34] church problems and ministry problems
[1:08:36] and we start looking at all those things
[1:08:38] but I'll tell you what you're looking
[1:08:39] at. You're looking at the husk. Amen. We
[1:08:41] look around. We say, "Brother Nathan,
[1:08:43] I'm worried about the message." Amen.
[1:08:44] I'm worried cuz I look and I see this is
[1:08:46] happening and that one's preaching that.
[1:08:48] I'm worried about our young people. I
[1:08:50] don't know if they'll be able to stand.
[1:08:51] I'm just worried this message will just
[1:08:53] dissolve away to nothing. Brother
[1:08:54] Nathan. Amen. And you might be worried,
[1:08:56] but God's not worried. You're looking at
[1:08:59] you. We look at say, "Brother Nathan,
[1:09:00] there's so many problems in the
[1:09:01] organization." But that's the problem.
[1:09:03] Amen. This message was not sent Amen.
[1:09:06] for the organization. So don't be
[1:09:08] surprised if you see organizational
[1:09:11] problems around the message of the hour.
[1:09:13] But the message was sent to individual
[1:09:16] hearts. He didn't send it for your
[1:09:18] church. He said it for you. Amen. to
[1:09:20] that little seed down on the inside of
[1:09:22] you to quicken you to life,
[1:09:26] bring something out of you like you
[1:09:27] never imagined. And he's not worried
[1:09:29] about it. God is Amen. God did not gain
[1:09:32] confidence in his children when you went
[1:09:34] to an altar. That's not when God got
[1:09:36] gained confidence in you. God didn't get
[1:09:38] confidence in you the first time you
[1:09:40] played uh you played a tape. He didn't
[1:09:42] gain his confidence in you. Amen. The
[1:09:44] first time you wrote a a ti check. Amen.
[1:09:46] He he didn't gain his confidence in you
[1:09:48] when you joined a church. God has had
[1:09:50] confidence in you ever since he placed a
[1:09:53] seed within you in his mind before the
[1:09:55] foundation of the world. He knows that
[1:09:57] anything he thought once it's spoken, it
[1:10:00] can never be taken back and it can't
[1:10:03] fail to accomplish
[1:10:05] what he pleased, what he wanted it to
[1:10:08] do. Friends, I whatever you think the
[1:10:10] ceiling of your potential is, you're
[1:10:13] probably underestimating yourself. I'm
[1:10:15] not preaching in kind of a modern day
[1:10:16] charismatic idea of how we all got to go
[1:10:19] around empty out hospitals and have
[1:10:20] worldwide ministries and drive Cadillacs
[1:10:23] and all those kind of things. I'm not
[1:10:24] talking about that. But I'm talking
[1:10:25] about you as a child of God have a
[1:10:28] purpose. There is something, amen, that
[1:10:30] was planted in your life and God, amen,
[1:10:33] has it in mind for you to bring you to a
[1:10:35] full blossom. Cuz there's something in
[1:10:37] your life. There's a color. There's a
[1:10:40] beauty. There's a fragrance which God
[1:10:42] wants to bring out of you. Amen. And he
[1:10:44] not bringing it out of the five-fold
[1:10:45] ministry. Amen. They got their own uh
[1:10:48] beauty. They got their own
[1:10:49] characteristics. But he needs a man. He
[1:10:52] needs a woman. He needs a boy. He needs
[1:10:53] a girl. Amen. Who can accept? Amen. That
[1:10:56] law of life. Amen. And come. Amen. And
[1:11:00] blossom under the light of this message
[1:11:02] and bring something out of you as an
[1:11:04] individual that a church could never put
[1:11:05] in you. A bunch of intellectual mental
[1:11:07] conceptions could never put it in you.
[1:11:09] Amen. Only God and his election, Amen.
[1:11:12] could put that in you. Oh, say, "Brother
[1:11:15] Nathan, amen." But I but uh you see,
[1:11:17] it's the humility of the seed that
[1:11:19] throws people. Say, "Brother Nathan, I'm
[1:11:21] looking at the great call of the hour."
[1:11:23] You know, Brother Matt, I'm listening to
[1:11:24] Brother Brandham and and and the things
[1:11:26] that he's preaching. He's talking about
[1:11:28] this bride. He said that the word bride
[1:11:30] would be the manifestation of this hour.
[1:11:32] That the the bride's revival would be
[1:11:34] the focus of this whole age. It' be the
[1:11:36] Amen. that'd be the pinnacle. Amen.
[1:11:38] Would be this adopted church of
[1:11:39] manifested sons and daughters. He said
[1:11:41] they'd be an invincible army. He said
[1:11:43] they live so close to God the devil
[1:11:45] wouldn't know what to do with them. Oh
[1:11:47] my. He He talking about this great
[1:11:48] calling. But brother man, I look at
[1:11:50] myself and I I look and I I feel so
[1:11:53] small and weak and humble and and I
[1:11:55] don't I I just think I believe it,
[1:11:57] brother Matt. I just don't think I could
[1:11:58] live it because I only have a little
[1:12:01] Jesus. I probably got I probably got
[1:12:02] less Jesus. It's not that I don't know
[1:12:04] Jesus, but I got less Jesus than anybody
[1:12:06] else in the church. I only got a little
[1:12:08] Jesus. I'll tell you about little Jesus.
[1:12:11] Little Jesus one day he went down to the
[1:12:13] temple and be under the light of who he
[1:12:16] was. He could sit down with a bunch of
[1:12:17] theologians. He could sit down with
[1:12:19] religious leaders and he could
[1:12:20] straighten them out on the scriptures.
[1:12:22] He could astonish them with his
[1:12:23] doctrine. Little Jesus could do that.
[1:12:26] Amen. The little Jesus is still Jehovah
[1:12:28] Jesus. If you only got a little bit of
[1:12:31] speck of Jesus. Amen. It's still healer
[1:12:33] Jesus. It's still deliverer Jesus.
[1:12:36] Brother Graham said, "There's no big
[1:12:37] heavy spots and little weak spots in
[1:12:39] God. The least touch of God is
[1:12:41] omnipotent. It's all powerful." Amen.
[1:12:44] Little Jesus can heal your body. Little
[1:12:47] Jesus can overcome your struggles.
[1:12:49] Little Jesus can deliver you from
[1:12:51] whatever you're going through. But the
[1:12:53] best thing about little Jesus, Little
[1:12:55] Jesus don't stay little. Brother Brand
[1:12:57] said, "When a man gets born again, a
[1:12:59] little button of light," he said, about
[1:13:00] the size of a button on your shirt. A
[1:13:02] little button of light comes down into
[1:13:04] that man. He said, "But the thing about
[1:13:06] it is it don't stay little." Just a
[1:13:08] little button of light, amen, when a man
[1:13:10] is born again, but all of a sudden that
[1:13:12] button, amen, begins to grow, amen, and
[1:13:14] it grows from a button to maybe a
[1:13:16] baseball, amen, to a basketball. And as
[1:13:19] that little light begins to grow within
[1:13:21] a person, all of a sudden it starts
[1:13:23] coming into friction with all the
[1:13:24] darkness of the flesh. It starts pushing
[1:13:27] on depression and it starts pushing on
[1:13:30] worldly habits and it starts pushing on
[1:13:32] sin and starts pushing on on anxiety and
[1:13:35] it starts pushing against all these
[1:13:36] things. Amen. Little Jesus won't stay
[1:13:39] little. Amen. When a seed is planted, it
[1:13:42] all it can do is grow. Once it's
[1:13:44] quickened, it'll grow and grow and grow
[1:13:46] and it starts to push things out that
[1:13:49] you had no power within yourself to
[1:13:51] remove. But it was only the pressure,
[1:13:53] amen, of that little light within you
[1:13:55] growing. Oh, I tell you what, if you
[1:13:58] only got a little Jesus, take a little
[1:13:59] Jesus down to church on Sunday morning.
[1:14:01] I don't care how backslid you are. Amen.
[1:14:03] Get in the atmosphere of the anointed
[1:14:05] preaching of the word. Worship with the
[1:14:07] saints. Amen. Get that seed in that
[1:14:09] atmosphere. And I'll tell you what,
[1:14:11] things that you tried for years to get
[1:14:13] rid of, all of a sudden that light one
[1:14:15] day will just grow just just close
[1:14:17] enough to it, it'll push it right out of
[1:14:19] your life. Amen. Stop trying so hard.
[1:14:23] Stop working so hard. Trust the seed
[1:14:25] that's within you. That's God's power to
[1:14:27] transform you.
[1:14:29] That's how he does it. That's his
[1:14:31] program. I'm coming to a good quote on
[1:14:33] it in a minute, but I'll tell a little
[1:14:35] story I like to tell. I had an old house
[1:14:37] in Ohio, a house I used to live in. Uh
[1:14:40] it was is in the middle of town and it
[1:14:42] had an ugly old dilapidated fence just
[1:14:44] falling apart. And I was looking at that
[1:14:46] fence. I said, I got to do something to
[1:14:48] make that fence look better. I didn't
[1:14:49] want to get a new fence because I don't
[1:14:51] know if you know this, fences ain't
[1:14:52] cheap.
[1:14:54] So, I said, "You know what I'll do? I'll
[1:14:55] go down. I'll get a flowering vine. Just
[1:14:57] a nice I'll find a good flowering vine.
[1:14:59] I'll plant on my fence and that'll
[1:15:00] pretty it up real good." So, I went down
[1:15:02] to Menard's. Glory to God. Hallelujah.
[1:15:05] And I bought and I I looking at all the
[1:15:07] different flowering vines and seeds that
[1:15:08] they have. Now, if any of you are
[1:15:09] gardeners, you're going to you're going
[1:15:11] to laugh at me now. I found one called
[1:15:13] Morning Glory.
[1:15:15] Oh, yeah. I really I thought I'd like
[1:15:17] the sound of that. Morning glory. So I
[1:15:19] bought some of that stuff and I went
[1:15:20] home. I started reading on the packet of
[1:15:23] that morning glory and on the back it
[1:15:25] said just take one seed and put it every
[1:15:26] six inches. Just one seed. And I thought
[1:15:29] I bought tons of this stuff. So I took
[1:15:31] that morning glory seed and I went all
[1:15:33] the way down my fence. I shook that seed
[1:15:35] all the way down. You know what? Nothing
[1:15:37] happened that day. Nothing happened the
[1:15:39] next day. Nothing happened even the next
[1:15:41] week. But there was something going on.
[1:15:44] Amen. Because a month or two later, all
[1:15:46] of a sudden, a little something began
[1:15:48] coming up out of out of underneath my
[1:15:50] fence. And before he long, you know,
[1:15:51] that morning glory, all of a sudden, it
[1:15:53] it grew up and just like it it just
[1:15:55] seemed like overnight it grew up and it
[1:15:57] filled that whole fence. Well, praise
[1:15:58] the Lord. That's where I wanted it was
[1:16:01] on my fence. The problem with morning
[1:16:02] glory, it doesn't stay where you want
[1:16:05] it. It doesn't stay where you want it.
[1:16:07] It It keeps growing and growing. So, it
[1:16:09] grew off my fence. It went up the side
[1:16:10] of my house. It went up the side of my
[1:16:12] garage. It got into my vegetable garden.
[1:16:14] It started at the bottom of my tomato
[1:16:16] plants and it curled its way all the way
[1:16:18] up to the tippy top. And I'll tell you
[1:16:20] something, weeds couldn't grow in my
[1:16:21] garden cuz it was too full of morning
[1:16:24] glory. That's what happens, friends.
[1:16:26] Amen. When a predestinated seed of God
[1:16:29] gets the baptism of the Holy Ghost,
[1:16:31] maybe nothing changes that day. Maybe
[1:16:33] nothing changes that week. But before
[1:16:35] long, something starts happening. Oh
[1:16:38] yeah, you get enough Jesus in you to
[1:16:40] come to church on Sunday and that's
[1:16:41] about all you want. You just want to
[1:16:43] show up, have a good service, go home,
[1:16:45] and do whatever you want to. Amen. But
[1:16:47] if you ever been quickened, brother, you
[1:16:49] can't settle for that. Amen. Jesus will
[1:16:51] go down to every corner of your life.
[1:16:53] He'll fill your house. He'll fill your
[1:16:54] garden. He'll fill your car. Amen. He'll
[1:16:57] take over everything. Amen. He'll choke
[1:17:00] out sin. I'm convinced. I'm convinced to
[1:17:03] this day you could drop a nuclear bomb
[1:17:04] on that old house. You could erase every
[1:17:07] memory of Nathan Ericson, but next
[1:17:08] spring that morning glory will come
[1:17:10] back. Sure as anything. Amen. Don't ever
[1:17:13] plant that in your yard. That's not That
[1:17:15] ain't no house h hot house plant. That's
[1:17:17] some kind of an original seed cuz it
[1:17:19] takes over everything. And that's the
[1:17:21] way it is. Amen. For a son or daughter
[1:17:23] of God that's come under the rising of
[1:17:25] the sun. Amen. And you realize that it's
[1:17:27] your time to rise and shine because the
[1:17:29] glory of God has been planted in your
[1:17:31] life. But he didn't plan it to stay
[1:17:33] humble. He planted it in you to make you
[1:17:36] a rapture ready, adopted, powerful,
[1:17:39] amen, son or daughter of God living in
[1:17:42] the bride's revival, manifesting the
[1:17:44] message of the hour.
[1:17:47] That's what God wanted out of you. He
[1:17:49] didn't really ask your opinion.
[1:17:52] Amen. There's, you see, there's only one
[1:17:53] limitation on how far a seed can grow,
[1:17:56] and that's what season it's living in.
[1:17:58] And you realize, Brother Bram declared
[1:18:00] to us in the rising of the sun. Amen.
[1:18:02] That we're not in the age of
[1:18:03] justification. We're not in the age of
[1:18:05] sanctification. We're not in the age of
[1:18:07] the Pentecostal baptism of the Holy
[1:18:09] Ghost. He said, "We're right now in the
[1:18:11] blossom. We're it's adoption time. It's
[1:18:14] rapture time, friends." Amen. The the
[1:18:16] the the signs of the times are
[1:18:18] everywhere. I don't know if you've been
[1:18:20] watching the news, friends, but but
[1:18:22] things are getting close. Amen. But what
[1:18:24] that tells you is that you're living in
[1:18:26] a season, Amen. Wherever you're at in
[1:18:28] your Christian walk, if there's more
[1:18:30] that you desire, I believe there's more
[1:18:33] available. Amen. And you're not going to
[1:18:35] drink him dry. Amen. You're not there.
[1:18:37] You're not going to exhaust. Amen. The
[1:18:40] nutrients and the strength and the
[1:18:41] power, Amen, that's laying in the
[1:18:43] message of the hour. Brother man said,
[1:18:45] just drink and drink and drink and drink
[1:18:48] and you'll bear fruit. It'll just come
[1:18:50] out automatically when you begin to feed
[1:18:53] on the word for your day in the season
[1:18:56] of manifestation. It's Easter time,
[1:18:58] friends. Brother Brandon would tell us
[1:19:00] about that overcomer. He tell us about
[1:19:03] he'd tell your story. Amen. How about
[1:19:06] that? I thought it was amazing. He uses
[1:19:08] a pond lily, specifically a pond lily of
[1:19:10] all the liies he could have chose. He
[1:19:12] takes a pond lily and and a pond lily,
[1:19:14] you know, it starts its life down on the
[1:19:16] bottom of a pond somewhere way down in
[1:19:18] the muck, just the slime on the bottom
[1:19:20] of a dirty pond. Little pond lily starts
[1:19:22] and you look over that that seed down
[1:19:25] there and and you can't tell that seed
[1:19:27] apart from all the other dirt around it.
[1:19:30] Looks just like a all the other rocks
[1:19:32] and earth and you can't tell the
[1:19:34] difference. Some of you know where you
[1:19:36] were where you were living when Jesus
[1:19:38] found you. Amen. and you were you just
[1:19:39] you look at you look at your neighbor
[1:19:41] look at the guy on the next bar stool.
[1:19:43] You can't tell the difference. It looked
[1:19:45] just the same. But it wasn't the same
[1:19:47] because there was a seed down in there.
[1:19:49] Amen. And somehow a little ray of light
[1:19:51] got down to the bottom of that pond and
[1:19:53] bounced down all those particles of dirt
[1:19:55] and struck you just right. Now it might
[1:19:57] not have been a big explosion that
[1:19:59] heaved up the bottom of that pond. You
[1:20:00] might not have whooped and hollered.
[1:20:02] Maybe it did. But maybe it didn't. Maybe
[1:20:04] nothing nothing real obvious happened.
[1:20:07] But from that time Amen. Things were
[1:20:09] different. Something, a little voice on
[1:20:11] the inside started talking to you. A
[1:20:14] still small voice started saying, "You
[1:20:15] know what? You got to get back to
[1:20:16] church." Amen. You got to think about
[1:20:18] what mama taught you. Amen. You got to
[1:20:20] you there's something in you. You know
[1:20:22] you're made for more than this. You know
[1:20:24] you weren't born to mess around with all
[1:20:25] this stuff. You got to get out of this
[1:20:27] filth. Amen. So that seed begins to open
[1:20:30] up. Amen. It finds itself in a filthy
[1:20:32] place. Amen. But there's a law in that
[1:20:35] seed that won't let it stay there. So,
[1:20:37] it starts to fight against the field.
[1:20:39] Oh, it gets dirty. It gets messy. Amen.
[1:20:42] But it's it's going somewhere. It crawls
[1:20:44] up out of that mud, pushes and strives
[1:20:47] in that darkness, and all of a sudden
[1:20:49] there's a breakthrough. Oh,
[1:20:52] I'll tell you what. Goes down to camp
[1:20:54] meeting. Amen. Has a real Holy Ghost
[1:20:57] breakthrough. And then it finds out it's
[1:20:59] still at the bottom of a pond.
[1:21:02] Now, I don't think anybody accused me of
[1:21:03] being against youth camps, but it's the
[1:21:05] way it is. Some of our young people have
[1:21:06] that experience. They get in the
[1:21:08] atmosphere of a of a good Holy Ghost
[1:21:10] meeting. Amen. And they they they have a
[1:21:12] real breakthrough in their life and then
[1:21:13] you get home and you find out, hey, I'm
[1:21:15] still under pressure. Amen. And I got
[1:21:16] all this weight of the world laying down
[1:21:18] on me. And then when it's when that
[1:21:20] little liy's underwater, you know, when
[1:21:21] the wind gets to blowing, all of a
[1:21:23] sudden it's pushed this way and all of a
[1:21:25] sudden it's pushed that way and it
[1:21:26] doesn't have the strength really to
[1:21:28] resist. Amen. Because it's just a little
[1:21:30] immature lily sprout. Amen. But there's
[1:21:32] something in it. It just Amen. it it
[1:21:34] just doesn't want to stay there. There's
[1:21:36] something higher calling it up. So, it
[1:21:38] starts to swim and it starts to push
[1:21:40] against the currents and all of a sudden
[1:21:42] it's going against the flow. Amen. Oh
[1:21:45] my. Yeah. It doesn't just doubt his
[1:21:48] experience just cuz now it's under
[1:21:49] pressure. No, there's the same law that
[1:21:52] brought it to a breakthrough. Amen. Is
[1:21:54] making it swim. It's making it push.
[1:21:56] It's saying, "No, I'm there's still
[1:21:58] something more for me."
[1:22:00] So, it pushes up and it swims and it
[1:22:02] looks around. Amen. Some of you older
[1:22:04] ones remember, Amen. God started dealing
[1:22:06] with your heart. Amen. And you change.
[1:22:08] And your same old friends, they didn't
[1:22:10] change with you. And you start looking
[1:22:12] around and they just didn't get what you
[1:22:14] they couldn't see what you were seeing.
[1:22:15] They couldn't hear what you were
[1:22:16] hearing. Amen. But so there's something
[1:22:18] in you and some there were days of your
[1:22:20] life you look at them and and and and
[1:22:22] you say, "Well, you know, maybe I'll
[1:22:24] just be like them. Maybe I'll just give
[1:22:25] up all this work and I'll just be a
[1:22:27] seaweed." You know, you you ever seen a
[1:22:30] like in a in a in a creek or something?
[1:22:32] Uh, I'm sure you got the same kind of
[1:22:33] vegetation we do. We got the We got I I
[1:22:36] call them the seaweed. They're fresh
[1:22:37] water. I don't know what else to call
[1:22:38] them. You know the ones, the little
[1:22:40] slimy plants. They got no strength or
[1:22:43] structure to them. They just whatever
[1:22:45] the water's doing, they just
[1:22:49] all they're made to do is live in
[1:22:51] shallow water and just go with the flow.
[1:22:53] And then when the when everything floods
[1:22:55] and the water starts running backwards,
[1:22:56] all of a sudden they just
[1:22:59] just whatever's normal, just whatever
[1:23:00] the world is doing. That's what But then
[1:23:02] the but that but for the lily the lily's
[1:23:04] got a strength to it. It's rooted way
[1:23:07] down deep. It's not born for shallow
[1:23:08] water. It's got a backbone. It's got a
[1:23:11] strength and amen. It starts swimming.
[1:23:12] It said, "No, there's still something
[1:23:14] more for me." It climbs up to the top of
[1:23:17] that pond and it gets above all those
[1:23:19] currents and then brother Ram says it
[1:23:22] opens up its blossom. Amen. And a
[1:23:24] beautiful fragrance comes out of it. It
[1:23:26] begins to give out of itself and
[1:23:27] everybody around it can enjoy it. He
[1:23:29] said, "That's the overcomer." Amen. Some
[1:23:31] of you been thinking, maybe even this
[1:23:33] morning, the devil was talking about
[1:23:34] where you came from and trying to bring
[1:23:36] you under condemnation because of your
[1:23:38] background. Say, "Well, you'll never be
[1:23:40] like so and so cuz they were raised in
[1:23:42] church and they never struggled with
[1:23:43] this or struggle with that." Amen. But
[1:23:45] brother Bam says, you can't point at
[1:23:46] that overcomer and say, "Look at where
[1:23:48] he came from. He came out of the muck.
[1:23:50] He came out of the mud." Brother Brham
[1:23:51] said, "But he's not in the mud now.
[1:23:54] Where is he? He's on top.
[1:23:58] He's an overcomer.
[1:24:00] See, who you are is not what you've come
[1:24:02] through. Who you are is where you came
[1:24:04] from in the first place. Hallelujah.
[1:24:08] It's a powerful It's a powerful sermon
[1:24:10] about that overcoming Easter lily. But
[1:24:12] I'll tell you something. You talk start
[1:24:14] preaching about an overcoming Christian
[1:24:15] life and and how it has a beauty and how
[1:24:18] it's on top of everything and giving out
[1:24:19] a fragrance. It hits a little different
[1:24:22] for a young man or a young woman or an
[1:24:24] older one who's not on top of
[1:24:27] everything. You got areas in your life
[1:24:29] you're just not on top. You're
[1:24:31] struggling with this, struggling with
[1:24:32] that, going through that, and you begin
[1:24:33] to say, "Well, you know, maybe I just
[1:24:35] don't really have what it takes because
[1:24:36] I'm under this water, Brother Nathan.
[1:24:38] Like you talked about, I had an
[1:24:39] experience with God one time, but now
[1:24:41] I'm just under this pressure and I feel
[1:24:43] all this influence of the world around
[1:24:44] me and I'm caught up in the current. I
[1:24:46] feel like I'm drowning, Brother Nathan."
[1:24:49] Amen. But here's what you got to
[1:24:50] remember. When that lily was weighed
[1:24:53] down in that filth, in that slimy muck,
[1:24:57] Amen. it was still a lily. Amen. When it
[1:25:00] was just pushed around on the bottom of
[1:25:01] the pond with no backbone to it, it was
[1:25:04] still a lily. It doesn't matter what
[1:25:05] stage it's at on the journey. Amen. That
[1:25:08] don't have anything to do with it. Amen.
[1:25:10] The law, it was a lily ever since the
[1:25:12] seed was quick in the life. Amen. It's a
[1:25:14] lily seed. Amen. It's a lily flower.
[1:25:16] It's lily life. And there's a law in
[1:25:18] lily life. Amen. It'll bring forth a
[1:25:21] blossom. Amen. It'll take a little time.
[1:25:23] It'll take a little overcoming. It'll
[1:25:26] take staying in the right atmosphere.
[1:25:27] It'll take a season. But it won't fail
[1:25:30] cuz it's God's law.
[1:25:33] You got to trust the seed that's in you.
[1:25:36] Amen. Something on the inside pulling
[1:25:38] you up, saying, "No, rise up above
[1:25:40] this." When everybody else around you
[1:25:42] say, young people say, "I'm just going
[1:25:43] to I'm just going to be like I'm going
[1:25:45] to throw it in the towel. I'm going to
[1:25:46] be like the world." But you're not a
[1:25:47] seaweed. Amen. You couldn't quit if you
[1:25:50] wanted to. It won't shut up that voice
[1:25:52] on the inside of you. Amen. Saying, "No,
[1:25:55] there's more to life than this. There's
[1:25:57] a higher calling. There's a higher
[1:25:59] place. And not only that, that's where I
[1:26:01] belong. I belong in those heavenly
[1:26:04] places. I belong in that overcoming
[1:26:06] life. Oh, it's still a lily, friends. On
[1:26:09] your worst day, you're still a child of
[1:26:11] God. On your best day, you're a child of
[1:26:13] God."
[1:26:15] Hallelujah. Brother Bam said he talked
[1:26:18] about remember in the restoration of
[1:26:19] bride tree he would talk about that law
[1:26:20] of life. He would take it to a a fish or
[1:26:23] he would take it to a a bird and he said
[1:26:25] there's a law life in a fish that makes
[1:26:28] it a certain way with certain
[1:26:29] characteristics because it's born for a
[1:26:31] certain environment. Right? It's born a
[1:26:34] fish is born to swim in the water. But
[1:26:36] he said what a fish might try to do.
[1:26:38] He's preaching to you now. He'll say a a
[1:26:40] fish might decide hey I don't want to be
[1:26:42] down here in this water. I want to go up
[1:26:44] and breathe air like the humans do. And
[1:26:46] so that he said that fish get a great
[1:26:47] big lung full of air and go up above
[1:26:50] that water. He said but he's not made
[1:26:52] for those conditions. There's a
[1:26:53] different law of life in them. So no
[1:26:55] matter how hard he tries to go up and
[1:26:57] breathe air, he's just going to bust
[1:26:58] open because he's not made for it. He
[1:27:01] said a bird a bird could get in their
[1:27:02] head. Well, I'm on a I I I believe I'm
[1:27:05] supposed to fly. And so that bird, he
[1:27:06] said, "Well, let me get a real running
[1:27:08] start. Let me run real hard, press real
[1:27:10] fast, and let me get a real running
[1:27:12] start and just jump up in the air and
[1:27:14] then I'll fly that way." But brother
[1:27:16] Brand said, "No, there's a law of life
[1:27:17] to a bird that he was born to be in a
[1:27:20] certain place and he's born with the
[1:27:22] equipment. He just got to open up those
[1:27:24] wings and let the wind come under that
[1:27:27] bird and it'll lift him up automatically
[1:27:29] to the place where he belongs. It's a
[1:27:32] law of life." And he said, "It's the
[1:27:34] same thing for a Christian." Amen. You
[1:27:36] get in your head. I'm going to try real
[1:27:38] hard to be an overcomer. I'm going to
[1:27:40] I'm going to You go to How many of you
[1:27:41] sat in an altar and said, "God, I'm
[1:27:42] really going to impress you this time.
[1:27:44] This time I'm really going to turn over
[1:27:46] a new life. I a leaf. I'm gonna I'm
[1:27:48] gonna I'm gonna work like never before.
[1:27:50] I'm going to try harder than I ever had.
[1:27:52] And you didn't make it 24 hours before
[1:27:54] you fell flat on your face. Amen.
[1:27:56] Because the law is not how hard you can
[1:27:58] work. You don't fly by running hard. You
[1:28:02] don't fly by jumping up in the air. You
[1:28:04] fly by setting your wings of faith.
[1:28:06] Amen. And trusting the law of life that
[1:28:08] God put in you when he created you.
[1:28:11] Hallelujah. He said we got a law of
[1:28:13] life. He said it's not what we fight and
[1:28:15] pull and hurry say, "Oh, if I don't get
[1:28:18] this and if I don't get that, that's not
[1:28:20] it." He said it's to know that the law
[1:28:23] of life is in you. Amen. And you just
[1:28:26] let go and let God. Amen. Then he takes
[1:28:29] you to your healing. He takes you to the
[1:28:31] baptism of the spirit or anything that
[1:28:33] he's promised. Any claim he's given is
[1:28:35] yours by letting go and letting God.
[1:28:39] Amen. Is this all right today? I know
[1:28:41] it's simple preaching, but it's kind of
[1:28:43] where we're living. Amen. Amen. Oh, you
[1:28:46] know, Brother Brham preached on that
[1:28:47] Reverend Mr. Lily, and I I was listening
[1:28:49] to him one time. Brother Brandham, he
[1:28:51] kind of goes on and on about Mr. Lily
[1:28:54] and how that Lily's got to toil. He's
[1:28:57] got to fight kind of like I was just
[1:28:58] preaching on. has got to fight to come
[1:29:00] up out of the muck and push against all
[1:29:01] those filthy things and how he toils to
[1:29:04] come out and bring forth blossom and
[1:29:06] bring out a fragrance and express the
[1:29:09] purpose that was put in him. Oh yeah.
[1:29:12] And he talks about quite a while about
[1:29:13] how this lilyy's got to toil and fight.
[1:29:15] Amen. To come up out of the dirt. And
[1:29:17] then I went and read what Jesus said
[1:29:19] about it.
[1:29:21] Excuse me. He said, "Consider the lily.
[1:29:24] They toil not,
[1:29:26] neither do they spin." Well, I said,
[1:29:28] "Well, there's a paradox." But I'll tell
[1:29:30] you what, friends, it's true. When you
[1:29:32] look at a lily, there's a It has to
[1:29:34] press. It has to toil. Amen. It's got to
[1:29:37] push against things to come up out of
[1:29:39] the earth and express the potential
[1:29:42] that's within it. But it doesn't have to
[1:29:44] toil to be a lily.
[1:29:47] Oh, friends. And you, I don't care how
[1:29:50] religious you think you are. You never
[1:29:52] worked one day in your life to be a son
[1:29:55] or daughter of God. It isn't how long
[1:29:57] you belong to church. It isn't how many
[1:29:59] tapes you listen to or how well you
[1:30:01] dress or how well you could talk the
[1:30:03] talk and fool everybody around you. That
[1:30:06] isn't what did it, friends. It was the
[1:30:08] grace of God to put a seed of life
[1:30:10] within you. And when he put the seed, he
[1:30:12] put a law of life in it that it didn't
[1:30:15] matter how you staggered and stumbled
[1:30:17] and struggled. Amen. You had to come
[1:30:19] forth and be a Christian life in this
[1:30:23] age because of the law of life. Not
[1:30:25] because of our efforts, not because of
[1:30:27] our merit, not because of what we've
[1:30:28] earned or who we are or what our status
[1:30:31] is, but because of the grace of God and
[1:30:33] because of the law of life. Ain't that
[1:30:35] beautiful? Amen. Brother Bam said that
[1:30:38] little seed when it bursts open into
[1:30:40] life, he said it can't do that until it
[1:30:43] comes through all that process. It's got
[1:30:46] to go through a process. Got to come
[1:30:47] through that. And that's what makes it,
[1:30:49] he said, because the sun itself is
[1:30:51] drawing it. Oh, and I love this. And
[1:30:54] when it goes above the dirty waters and
[1:30:55] muck and so forth, he said, then it's so
[1:30:58] happy. It gives its life out freely. And
[1:31:01] it's a beautiful life when it gets in
[1:31:04] the presence of that which is drawing it
[1:31:06] up. Now, there's people sitting in in in
[1:31:10] probably every one of our churches,
[1:31:12] amen, that that they're in they're
[1:31:14] living in a miserable place called
[1:31:16] religion. halfway between the world and
[1:31:18] Christ. And they're somewhere down in
[1:31:20] the muck, somewhere in dirty water,
[1:31:22] can't see clearly. Amen. Pushed by the
[1:31:25] tides. Amen. And living in that place.
[1:31:27] And it's hard to believe. Amen. When
[1:31:29] you're such when you're just a miserable
[1:31:31] religious hypocrite, it's hard to
[1:31:33] believe in that beautiful life that I'm
[1:31:35] talking about. But let me tell you,
[1:31:36] brother, sister, Amen. If you feel Amen.
[1:31:39] When you come to church, you feel the
[1:31:40] presence of the Lord begin to move and
[1:31:42] you feel that you feel something just
[1:31:44] sweep over you and something just
[1:31:46] pulling you to that higher place. Let me
[1:31:48] tell you, amen. If you could get to to
[1:31:51] him that is drawing you. Amen. If you
[1:31:53] just run to him that's pulling on you,
[1:31:56] cuz when you really get to Christ, if
[1:31:57] you get past the church and get to
[1:31:59] Christ, it's a beautiful life. It's
[1:32:01] beautiful to be one of God's liies. It's
[1:32:03] beautiful to just open up. Amen. And be
[1:32:06] a colorful Christian and bring out a
[1:32:08] fragrance and express yourself and have
[1:32:10] value and worth in the economy of God.
[1:32:13] That's what we're called to. Friends,
[1:32:15] don't settle for less. If you're halfway
[1:32:17] there, don't quit. Amen. But let that
[1:32:19] law of life go to work. When that little
[1:32:21] seed on the inside begins crying out,
[1:32:23] say, "No, I don't want that. Don't reach
[1:32:25] for that. Don't watch that. Don't grab
[1:32:27] that. Amen. Don't eat that. Don't drink
[1:32:29] that. Reach for that."
[1:32:32] Amen. Then what do we what do we do? We
[1:32:34] yield oursel to the law of life on the
[1:32:36] inside. And trust that seed cuz it's
[1:32:38] taken you to a beautiful place in the
[1:32:40] presence of the sun. You say, "Brother
[1:32:42] Nathan, I I've been I've been around
[1:32:44] message churches all my life and I
[1:32:46] haven't had much of a life, but I'll
[1:32:48] tell you what, if you if you ever break
[1:32:49] into the reality of this message, I'll
[1:32:52] tell you the message of the hour is the
[1:32:53] only thing that I've ever seen produce
[1:32:55] life. It's life. It's not just any kind
[1:32:57] of life. It's life abundantly. Oh, it's
[1:33:00] it's real life. The literal life of
[1:33:02] Christ. A beautiful life.
[1:33:05] A beautiful life. Oh, amen. When it gets
[1:33:08] in the presence of that which is drawing
[1:33:10] up. I friends, I'm in a growing process
[1:33:12] like everybody. Amen. But I can't stay
[1:33:14] where I'm at. Amen. I'm pushing up into
[1:33:16] his presence. I I'm reaching for that
[1:33:19] beautiful life. I want more of him. I
[1:33:21] just want more of him. Hallelujah. You
[1:33:25] see, we try to we try to impress God and
[1:33:27] everybody else by with that our our just
[1:33:30] religious display, but Brother Bram
[1:33:32] said, "God doesn't want liies on the
[1:33:33] altar. He wants you on the altar. You're
[1:33:36] his lily. God didn't send a message to
[1:33:38] make a bunch of pretty church members
[1:33:40] and nice buildings." And we thank God
[1:33:42] for all those things. He didn't He
[1:33:44] didn't send a He didn't send the message
[1:33:45] so we could preach a bunch of flowery
[1:33:47] sermons and Amen. and dress up nice and
[1:33:49] have a little community. Amen. And just
[1:33:51] just have a nice religious group. That's
[1:33:53] not what it's for. He sent a message,
[1:33:56] amen, to to bring a seed to life within
[1:33:58] you. Amen. So that you, not anybody else
[1:34:01] but you, amen, could blossom into
[1:34:03] something God was thinking about before
[1:34:05] the foundation of the world. Oh yeah.
[1:34:08] God's got everybody. God don't just have
[1:34:10] preachers in his mind. Amen. He's got
[1:34:12] singers. He's got prayers. He's got He's
[1:34:14] got He's got praisers. He's got He's got
[1:34:17] deacons. He's got workers. He's got
[1:34:19] mothers. He's got all of it in his
[1:34:20] bouquet.
[1:34:22] They're not all the same, but they're
[1:34:23] all seeds of God. Oh my. This message
[1:34:28] will give you so much purpose. It'll
[1:34:30] give you so much life. It'll give
[1:34:31] meaning to your life. That's what a seed
[1:34:33] is all about. The sermon of a seed is
[1:34:35] all about purpose.
[1:34:37] How many know that? We try to kind of
[1:34:39] live a a comfortable life, a religious
[1:34:41] service. Well, yeah, we'll go to church
[1:34:44] on Sunday. We'll do all this kind of
[1:34:45] thing. Amen. And just make a convenient
[1:34:48] sacrifice, but a real seed. They don't
[1:34:51] settle for that. No, there's something
[1:34:53] in them that says, "Hey, I I wasn't I'm
[1:34:54] not put here just for Sunday go and
[1:34:56] meeting Christianity. I'm not put here
[1:34:58] just to keep a pew warm and show up a
[1:35:01] couple times a month. I'm I'm here to do
[1:35:03] something. I'm here I'm here to fulfill
[1:35:05] something. I have a calling. I have a
[1:35:08] ministry. I have a purpose." That's what
[1:35:10] a seed is crying out. Amen. Oh my. Every
[1:35:14] time the Bible talks about a flower,
[1:35:15] it's preaching a sermon of purpose. Job
[1:35:18] Job would look at that flower. Hey, we
[1:35:20] talk about the flower. He said, "Man
[1:35:21] that's born a woman, he's a few days
[1:35:24] full of trouble." Ain't that right? He's
[1:35:27] a few days and full of trouble. He comes
[1:35:29] forth like a flower and he's cut down.
[1:35:32] And and Isaiah or uh Peter would say,
[1:35:34] "All flesh is grass and all the glory of
[1:35:36] man is the flower of grass. The g the
[1:35:38] grass witherth. The flower thereof
[1:35:40] fallth away, but the word of the Lord
[1:35:42] endureth forever." Amen. So everything
[1:35:45] what the what the Bible's talking about
[1:35:46] he's comp he's saying that your human
[1:35:48] life is like a flower and what it means
[1:35:50] is it's fragile. It's fragile friends.
[1:35:53] Life is fragile. It don't last very
[1:35:56] long. I know it's a little different
[1:35:58] kind of preaching but I hope this all
[1:35:59] right. It's fragile. It doesn't last
[1:36:02] very long. You don't get a lot of time
[1:36:04] on this earth. Maybe less than you
[1:36:06] think. And so it's fragile and it seems
[1:36:09] like it doesn't have much meaning. It's
[1:36:10] like dandelions that come up in the
[1:36:12] yard. you know, they they come forth and
[1:36:14] they're there for a short time and they
[1:36:16] look beautiful and then my wife comes
[1:36:17] and puts the weed and feed down and
[1:36:19] kills them all and and and or the mower
[1:36:22] comes along and cuts them down. It
[1:36:23] doesn't last very long. Amen. So, what's
[1:36:26] it all about? What's the point? What's
[1:36:28] the purpose? Amen. What is the flower of
[1:36:31] a human life all about? It doesn't mean
[1:36:34] anything until you can see God's
[1:36:36] purpose. Amen. But take a little flower.
[1:36:39] It just lasts for a little while and
[1:36:41] then it wilts away and it goes to
[1:36:42] nothing. But put that but when Job looks
[1:36:45] at that flower, put that flower under
[1:36:48] the gaze of a prophet. Come on,
[1:36:50] somebody. Put it under the When a
[1:36:52] prophet looks down on that flower, all
[1:36:54] of a sudden it changes from a temporary
[1:36:57] nothing to a sermon about the
[1:36:59] resurrection. Amen. And it begins to
[1:37:01] testify, amen, that hey, this life
[1:37:03] that's here for a few days and full of
[1:37:05] trouble. Amen. When it goes back into
[1:37:08] the ground, that's not the end of
[1:37:09] things. Amen. But it's part of something
[1:37:12] greater. It serves a greater purpose.
[1:37:15] Amen. Cuz all of God's liies liies are
[1:37:17] perennials. Amen. They go down in the
[1:37:20] winter, but when the spring comes
[1:37:21] around, they come right back. You take a
[1:37:24] son or daughter of God, you can Amen.
[1:37:26] They can have they can go through all
[1:37:27] kinds of trouble, trials, and
[1:37:29] tribulations. Put them in the ground.
[1:37:31] Amen. Let them come to an untimely end.
[1:37:33] Amen. But when that resurrection comes,
[1:37:35] they'll come back up testifying of the
[1:37:37] eternal life of God. Amen. Because
[1:37:40] because the flower of your life is
[1:37:42] serving the purpose of declaring God's
[1:37:44] resurrection. Amen. Look. Amen. And
[1:37:48] that's that's what a seed will do,
[1:37:50] friends. See, Job's revelation of that
[1:37:52] resurrection is a revelation of purpose.
[1:37:56] See, this flower is frail, but there's a
[1:38:00] reason for its existence. It never
[1:38:02] became clear maybe till it came under
[1:38:04] the view of a prophet. But that's what I
[1:38:07] believe, friends. Everything that the
[1:38:08] message tells me is that I'm not here on
[1:38:11] earth to live 60, 70 years, get married,
[1:38:15] have kids, a job, a house, and all those
[1:38:19] things, and then die and all of it fade
[1:38:20] off into the void and mean nothing. I
[1:38:24] believe in purpose. There's something
[1:38:26] inside of me that says there's got to be
[1:38:29] more to this life than just to toil a
[1:38:32] little while and die. There's something
[1:38:34] crying out saying, "No, I must have
[1:38:36] fallen from somewhere. I must have come
[1:38:38] from something cuz there's a life within
[1:38:40] me that's pushing up to a higher place
[1:38:43] than where I am now." Oh friends, every
[1:38:46] one of God's seed has a purpose. There
[1:38:48] is no such thing as a seed without a
[1:38:51] purpose. And there's no such thing as a
[1:38:53] child of God without a destiny. I don't
[1:38:56] care how insignificant you think you
[1:38:57] are. You think you walk out the doors of
[1:38:59] this church and nobody would even miss
[1:39:01] you and it wouldn't ever matter that you
[1:39:03] were here. That's a lie. Amen. That's a
[1:39:06] lie of the enemy. Every one of God's
[1:39:08] children was planted for a purpose. And
[1:39:11] every one of them has a place in God's
[1:39:13] bouquet. And whatever kind of life you
[1:39:16] live here, I'm telling you, it matters.
[1:39:18] It might not matter through what the
[1:39:20] world was telling you. It might not
[1:39:21] matter, amen, from a worldly
[1:39:23] perspective. But if you lay under the
[1:39:25] light of the sun, under the gaze of this
[1:39:27] prophetic message, this word will give
[1:39:29] you purpose. It'll give you a
[1:39:31] purpose-driven life. It'll tell you,
[1:39:33] you're not here just to waste your time,
[1:39:35] but you got something in you that needs
[1:39:38] to be expressed so God's purpose can be
[1:39:40] accomplished.
[1:39:42] Everyone has a purpose. Say, Brother
[1:39:44] Nathan, I'm just a kid. I'm just a young
[1:39:46] person in the church. Brother Bam said
[1:39:49] even a bud belongs in God's bouquet.
[1:39:51] Yeah. He don't take all He don't He said
[1:39:53] he don't put everything in his bouquet
[1:39:54] that's just fully open and in full
[1:39:56] blossom. Sometimes he takes a bud. Amen.
[1:39:59] He takes a little bud. You know what he
[1:40:00] was talking about? He was talking about
[1:40:01] a young man in his church that had
[1:40:04] passed away very young, a tragic death.
[1:40:07] And that was a context where brother
[1:40:08] Bram said, "But you know what he said?
[1:40:09] God has a purpose and sometimes he needs
[1:40:12] to take a bud that's not fully formed
[1:40:14] and put it in his bouquet." Friends,
[1:40:17] over these years, we've seen tragedy.
[1:40:19] We've suffered trials. Amen. We've cried
[1:40:22] out why. We've looked for purpose and
[1:40:24] and came up lacking. But there is
[1:40:26] purpose. There's purpose in everything
[1:40:27] God does. There's purpose in everything
[1:40:29] that we go through. Amen. The message
[1:40:32] gave us purpose because it's the message
[1:40:33] that revealed to us that we are a seed.
[1:40:36] Amen. And if you're a seed of God, you
[1:40:38] might feel like you're just a bud. You
[1:40:39] may feel like you've not opened up fully
[1:40:41] in your life, but you belong. You're
[1:40:43] important in the church of God. It
[1:40:45] matters that you come and sing and clap
[1:40:47] your hands and praise the Lord and say,
[1:40:49] "Amen." Amen. You can't be replaced.
[1:40:52] You're not insignificant. You're
[1:40:54] irreplaceable. You're in God's purpose.
[1:40:58] There's nobody in the bride of Christ
[1:40:59] that doesn't serve a purpose.
[1:41:02] Oh my. You know those those some of
[1:41:04] those buds, some of some liies are how
[1:41:07] many know brother said it's the lily
[1:41:08] that was used to make opium. But to
[1:41:10] become opium, it has to be crushed. has
[1:41:14] to be crushed. There's people sitting
[1:41:15] here today. You've come through things.
[1:41:17] You crawled through all manner of hell
[1:41:18] to come into this church today. Through
[1:41:20] your life, you've been crushed and
[1:41:22] leaned on. You've been under pressure.
[1:41:24] And in the moment, all you cried out
[1:41:26] said, "God, why? Why are you pressing on
[1:41:29] me like this? Why do I have to be
[1:41:31] crushed?" But on the other side of the
[1:41:33] pressing, wasn't there a sweetness?
[1:41:36] Wasn't there a beauty? Wasn't there a
[1:41:37] savior? That's when that opium, that's
[1:41:39] where that perfume comes from. Sometimes
[1:41:41] the flowers got to be crushed, but
[1:41:43] beauty comes out of it. There's nothing
[1:41:46] that happens to a Christian that's not
[1:41:49] purposeful, that's not beautiful, that
[1:41:52] doesn't serve God's purpose. Oh yeah,
[1:41:55] all the things that we we think are we
[1:41:58] think things were wasted years. We think
[1:41:59] they were mistakes and they had no
[1:42:01] merit. But God was forming something
[1:42:02] even in our failures. You don't believe
[1:42:05] me on that? You take brother Brandham,
[1:42:07] one of the greatest mistakes of his
[1:42:08] life. remember how he how he listened to
[1:42:11] his mother-in-law instead of listening
[1:42:13] to the Lord. And because of that, he
[1:42:15] lost his wife, he lost his little baby,
[1:42:17] and he had to sit there and watch his
[1:42:19] precious little girl, her eyes crossing
[1:42:20] with pain. Nobody, how could you listen
[1:42:23] to Brother tell the story and not just
[1:42:24] break down weeping when he talked about
[1:42:26] the pain of that moment of watching that
[1:42:29] and you say, "Oh, what a defeat. What a
[1:42:31] terrible circumstance." But then look
[1:42:34] how the Lord turned that around and
[1:42:36] every crosseyed baby brother Brandham
[1:42:37] ever prayed for was healed. That's the
[1:42:40] kind of God I'm talking about. A God of
[1:42:42] purpose. A God who can bring beauty out
[1:42:44] of ashes. He's a God who can take your
[1:42:47] greatest failures, your greatest
[1:42:50] defeats, and turn it into victory. Amen.
[1:42:53] God can get purpose out of every one of
[1:42:55] his children. You think God only uses
[1:42:57] preachers? You think he only uses men or
[1:43:00] officers or prophets? Amen. God uses all
[1:43:03] of his people. They all belong in his
[1:43:05] economy. They all belong in his bouquet.
[1:43:09] It matters, friends. Amen. The life in
[1:43:12] you matters.
[1:43:14] Oh, brother B said, "If everything that
[1:43:16] serves God's purpose has got a
[1:43:17] resurrection,
[1:43:20] it can only rise if it serves God's
[1:43:22] purpose. If a flower lives and it's not
[1:43:25] germatized," he said, "It won't live
[1:43:26] again." But he also said, "You can't
[1:43:28] keep anything in the ground that serves
[1:43:31] God's purpose." Oh, friends, I want my
[1:43:33] life to serve a purpose. I want my life
[1:43:36] to serve a purpose. That's what Reverend
[1:43:37] Mr. Lily's preaching. And you got a you
[1:43:39] got a purpose. You, not anybody else in
[1:43:42] this church, but you as a seed of God.
[1:43:45] God put a law on you. He set a process
[1:43:47] in motion when he when you were born
[1:43:49] again. Amen. To bring a life growing up
[1:43:52] out of you. Amen. But he's trying to
[1:43:54] bring you to a place where you where you
[1:43:56] can just open up and come into that
[1:43:59] beautiful Christian life. Come into the
[1:44:01] presence of that sun that's drawing you
[1:44:03] and open up and that a fragrance and a
[1:44:05] beauty can come out of your life and
[1:44:09] that nobody else can reproduce. You say,
[1:44:12] "Well, I got a there's a there's a dozen
[1:44:14] roses in our pulpit." Yeah, but he needs
[1:44:16] a daffodil and he needs a he needs a
[1:44:18] hydrangeanger and that's about all the
[1:44:19] flowers I know. He needs it. He needs
[1:44:21] you to serve his purpose. He sent a
[1:44:25] message to te to show you that you have
[1:44:27] a purpose. That's why I love this
[1:44:29] message. Amen. He talked about the lily.
[1:44:31] Amen. Remember Jesus said Solomon in all
[1:44:33] his glory wasn't arrayed like one of
[1:44:36] these. You know, it's amazing, brother
[1:44:38] Brand would say that. He said, "The
[1:44:40] reason why is because Solomon, you look
[1:44:42] at Solomon, all his robes and his crown
[1:44:44] and his jewels and his gold and all that
[1:44:46] and all and as as majestic a person as
[1:44:50] as Solomon would have been, it's doesn't
[1:44:52] even compare to a lily." Brother Bram
[1:44:54] said, "Because all of that was
[1:44:55] artificial, but a lily is natural. It's
[1:44:59] it's got a real life to it." Oh friends,
[1:45:02] I'll tell you what, the more that I
[1:45:04] read, the more that I listen to this
[1:45:06] message, the less I wanted this
[1:45:08] hypocritical, put on fake religion of
[1:45:10] trying to impress everybody and act like
[1:45:12] everybody else, try to imitate somebody.
[1:45:15] That ain't what the message means to me.
[1:45:16] God sent me a message. Amen. So that I
[1:45:19] could be Nathan Ericson. Amen. Do what
[1:45:21] Nathan Ericson does. Act like Nathan
[1:45:23] Ericen acts. Amen. Minister like Nathan
[1:45:26] Ericson does. That I could be me and not
[1:45:28] be somebody else. Amen. That's all God
[1:45:31] asks of you is just to be the kind of
[1:45:33] seed you are. He don't ask you to put on
[1:45:36] anything artificial. He don't ask you to
[1:45:38] dress it up. Just be a real Christian.
[1:45:41] Just be you. But be the version of you
[1:45:44] God wants you to be.
[1:45:46] I'll tell you what, we've had so much of
[1:45:48] trying to take take a robe of
[1:45:50] Christianity and force it on people and
[1:45:52] just get it to just strangle them with a
[1:45:54] bunch of rules and regulations. That
[1:45:56] ain't nothing what like the what the
[1:45:57] message is. Amen. But the message is
[1:45:59] calling somebody. Amen. Not to a legal
[1:46:02] Amen. Not to a legal obligation. Amen.
[1:46:04] But to a personal expression, calling
[1:46:07] you up into a a into something which can
[1:46:10] bring something out of you.
[1:46:12] A a character and a quality and a
[1:46:15] fragrance that's unique. Oh, and it's
[1:46:18] needed and it's important. You can dress
[1:46:22] somebody up as a Christian, but it'll
[1:46:23] never be natural. But I believe in
[1:46:24] natural Christianity. Amen. I believe
[1:46:27] Christianity was made for human beings.
[1:46:31] But we do a whole lot of trying to not
[1:46:33] be human beings. Amen. You remember when
[1:46:36] brother Brandham was preaching God in
[1:46:37] simplicity, he was dedicating that new
[1:46:39] tabernacle and he said that no, it
[1:46:42] doesn't matter how beautiful the
[1:46:43] structure is. Amen. But the beauty of a
[1:46:46] church is the character of the people.
[1:46:48] It's not the structure. I'm not talking
[1:46:50] about the building necessarily, but the,
[1:46:51] you know, the structure of the church,
[1:46:53] the organization of it, the group. You
[1:46:55] understand? Amen. That's not the beauty
[1:46:57] of this message. The beauty of this
[1:46:59] message isn't the churches that we built
[1:47:00] on it. Amen. It's the individuals that
[1:47:03] it's turned out lives which have been
[1:47:05] changed. Amen. And come into a maturity
[1:47:08] and an adoption authority under the
[1:47:11] presence of this son, laying in the
[1:47:13] light of the message of the hour. That's
[1:47:15] the beauty of the message is the people
[1:47:17] that it's produced. And I tell you, I
[1:47:19] know we've seen a lot of false, but
[1:47:21] we've seen a lot of real. And some of
[1:47:23] the realest, truest, bluest, Amen. the
[1:47:25] most real life of Christ you've ever
[1:47:27] seen, the realest love, the realest
[1:47:29] peace, and the realest joy. Amen. Was
[1:47:31] produced by the message of the hour.
[1:47:34] Amen. In people that didn't just accept
[1:47:36] it as the church they belong to, but
[1:47:39] accepted it as the calling of God in
[1:47:41] their own personal life. God's got a
[1:47:44] flower garden, friends. And everybody
[1:47:47] serves a purpose in the bouquet.
[1:47:51] I don't believe in churches without a
[1:47:53] purpose. I don't believe the Lord raised
[1:47:55] brother Matt up to pastor without a
[1:47:57] purpose. I don't believe he called you
[1:47:59] to attend here without a purpose. I
[1:48:00] don't believe Grace Tabernacle sitting
[1:48:02] here in Arkansas just to have church for
[1:48:04] a few years and and and and go to
[1:48:07] heaven. I believe we're here for I I
[1:48:10] believe.
[1:48:12] Are you with me today? I I believe in
[1:48:14] purpose. Purpose. I Amen. I believe True
[1:48:17] Tabernacle is there for a purpose. I
[1:48:19] believe Brother Wayne came there for a
[1:48:20] purpose. I believe we're there with him
[1:48:21] for a purpose. Amen. I believe in
[1:48:23] purpose. And I believe if you'll just
[1:48:26] accept the message of the hour for what
[1:48:28] it is, it'll give you purpose.
[1:48:30] Oh, and I when you realize that there's
[1:48:32] something being expressed today, God
[1:48:35] didn't just have a prophet. He had a
[1:48:37] bride. He didn't just have one mature
[1:48:40] grain. He had a whole field under the
[1:48:43] wave she chief message coming up to a
[1:48:45] maturity. That's God's bouquet. He
[1:48:48] didn't just want to bring a prophet to
[1:48:49] his maturity. He wants to bring you to
[1:48:50] your maturity. But what does that mean?
[1:48:52] It means you coming and fulfilling the
[1:48:55] position that God had for you. Oh, who
[1:48:57] could preach adoption like brother
[1:48:59] Brandham? I tell you, I'm I'm off my
[1:49:01] notes now, but but look, who could
[1:49:03] preach the adoption like our prophet?
[1:49:05] I'll tell you what, you could take any
[1:49:06] one of those charismatic leaders,
[1:49:08] brother Matt. I believe if he went down
[1:49:09] to any of those Pentecostals or
[1:49:11] televangelists back in the 60s and
[1:49:13] pulled one of them aside and the Lord
[1:49:15] said to that man said, "I've chosen you.
[1:49:18] You're going to be the one who's going
[1:49:19] to break forth the the message of
[1:49:21] adoption to the church. You're going to
[1:49:23] that it's time for the manifestation of
[1:49:25] sons and I've chosen you. You
[1:49:26] charismatic, you Pentecostal, and you're
[1:49:28] going to go out and preach adoption.
[1:49:30] You're going to be the one. You what
[1:49:32] would it look like?" Let me ask you that
[1:49:34] today. What would it have looked like?
[1:49:35] I'll tell you what it would look like.
[1:49:36] It would have been that guy and a 100
[1:49:38] movie car cameras following him all
[1:49:41] around the world on a global tour and
[1:49:43] he'd be emptying out hospitals and he'd
[1:49:45] be walking on water and he'd be doing
[1:49:46] all that kind of stuff and getting all
[1:49:48] the spotlight. There would be no room
[1:49:49] for you. There'd be no room for me. But
[1:49:52] God had a prophet who could come and
[1:49:54] preach the adoption series. And he said,
[1:49:56] "Your adoption is simply your positional
[1:49:58] placing." He said, "If you're a farmer,
[1:50:01] you be a good farmer. If you're a
[1:50:03] factory worker, you work at that factory
[1:50:04] and witness to the one next to you on
[1:50:06] the assembly line. He said, "If you're a
[1:50:08] mother," one time he said, "Well," he
[1:50:10] said, "Oh, Brother Brand, but I'm just a
[1:50:11] housewife." He said, "If you're a
[1:50:12] housewife, you're just as much David as
[1:50:14] the rest of them. You are anointed to be
[1:50:16] a mother. Anointed to be a wife. There's
[1:50:19] room in the message of the hour for
[1:50:21] every single one of us. It came not to
[1:50:23] take purpose from you, but to give it to
[1:50:26] you. It didn't come to make an audience
[1:50:28] member out of you. came to make a
[1:50:30] Christian a son or daughter of God
[1:50:33] with power to become. Oh, amen. That's
[1:50:37] the kind of message we're dealing with,
[1:50:38] friends. Amen. It's God's bouquet. Amen.
[1:50:42] He's got everyone in it for a reason.
[1:50:45] Amen. And that's that's what we got to
[1:50:47] look at. That's what we got to get a
[1:50:48] hold of. You see, you know what? I Let's
[1:50:51] Let's say hypothetically I bought my
[1:50:53] wife a bouquet. You know, probably been
[1:50:56] a little too long. But if I, let's say I
[1:50:58] bought her some flowers and I brought
[1:51:00] her home a nice bouquet of flowers and
[1:51:02] said, "Here you go, honey." She doesn't
[1:51:04] look at me and say, "What field did they
[1:51:07] grow those in?"
[1:51:11] Really? Were they on sale? How much how
[1:51:13] much did it cost? And what road did you
[1:51:15] take to the store? And what road did you
[1:51:17] bring home? And who was working the
[1:51:19] counter when you checked out? She don't
[1:51:22] care about any of that. She not
[1:51:24] interested in any of that. She's only
[1:51:26] interested in the expression of what was
[1:51:29] in my heart, the expression of my heart
[1:51:31] for her when in buying those flowers.
[1:51:34] It's the gesture that means something to
[1:51:35] her. It's the It's the message of my
[1:51:38] heart to her. And friends, God didn't
[1:51:41] send a message so we could talk about
[1:51:43] who goes to what church and who's got
[1:51:45] the best ministry and who sings the best
[1:51:47] and who quotes the most quotes. Amen.
[1:51:49] And who's preaching this and who's
[1:51:51] preaching that. Amen. And who's got the
[1:51:52] most views on YouTube. It doesn't
[1:51:55] matter.
[1:51:56] What matters is God sent a message and
[1:52:00] it's an expression of love for his
[1:52:02] bride. It came from the heart of God.
[1:52:05] Straight to your heart. Receive it for
[1:52:08] what it is. It's a message to your
[1:52:10] heart, not to your church, not to your
[1:52:12] organization,
[1:52:14] not to any other man or woman. It came
[1:52:16] to you to turn your heart back to what
[1:52:19] God had in mind for you from the
[1:52:21] beginning. Oh, I'm looking out here,
[1:52:23] friends. And maybe you don't see what I
[1:52:25] see from the pulpit. But I see God's
[1:52:27] bouquet. I look around the room. I see
[1:52:29] some of you I know. Some of you I don't.
[1:52:31] Some I could just tell by your
[1:52:32] countenance. Amen. That the that the the
[1:52:34] the glory of God's just resting on your
[1:52:37] life. I can see I see the I see the
[1:52:39] marks of people who've been through
[1:52:40] trials, been through hurts, been through
[1:52:43] different things. You've pressed through
[1:52:44] the muck. You've swam through the
[1:52:46] waters. Amen. But there was something
[1:52:48] that brought you through all that. What
[1:52:50] was it? God had something in his heart
[1:52:53] concerning you. So he put a seed in you
[1:52:55] and he put a law on that seed that it
[1:52:58] could not fail to bring you back into
[1:53:00] the presence of him that was drawing you
[1:53:03] from the beginning. And it's God's
[1:53:05] bouquet. Oh, and when you look at it
[1:53:07] that when you look at the bride of
[1:53:08] Christ, stop looking at all the drama.
[1:53:11] Stop looking at all the negative. Look
[1:53:13] at the message. Look at look at the
[1:53:15] victory in the lives around you. And you
[1:53:17] realize all and all once you see the
[1:53:19] message, brother Bram said, you can't
[1:53:20] see nothing else. And friends, I have
[1:53:23] seen it. I've seen it. I've been around
[1:53:25] enough message believers to know they're
[1:53:26] human beings with human being problems.
[1:53:29] Amen. But I know, amen, that the
[1:53:31] character of God, that the mysteries of
[1:53:33] his heart are being expressed in the
[1:53:35] bride of Jesus Christ. I can smell the
[1:53:37] fragrance. I can stand in the pulpit and
[1:53:39] preach to you. And I could feel that
[1:53:41] pulsation of faith. I could feel that
[1:53:43] pull. Amen. And I know these are people,
[1:53:46] amen, that are that are reaching out and
[1:53:48] grasping for God's message, saying,
[1:53:50] "Give me that bouquet. Amen. Let me get
[1:53:52] a hold of that flower. Amen. Let me
[1:53:54] smell that fragrance. Let me come into
[1:53:56] blossom. I want to be what God wanted me
[1:53:58] to be. I want to fulfill my purpose.
[1:54:02] Oh my. It's everything the message is
[1:54:05] about.
[1:54:07] You just look flower after flower, life
[1:54:09] after life. Even all God's five-fold
[1:54:11] ministry, they're all testifying the
[1:54:13] same. That God loved you before there
[1:54:15] was a world. He loved you and accepted
[1:54:18] you and chose you in himself before the
[1:54:20] foundation of the earth. He died for
[1:54:22] you. The lamb was slain before the world
[1:54:24] existed.
[1:54:26] Oh, it's the it's a message of love.
[1:54:29] I don't know if any of you have done
[1:54:30] this down here. It's a real old thing. I
[1:54:33] think I don't know how long goes back to
[1:54:35] like Victorian times or medieval times.
[1:54:38] something little girls used to do. Maybe
[1:54:40] some of you have done it. They used to
[1:54:42] take a flower and go peted by petal and
[1:54:46] start pulling it off. Remember what you
[1:54:49] say? He loves me. He loves me not. He
[1:54:52] loves me. He loves me not. Right? Got to
[1:54:55] find out whether he whether he loves
[1:54:57] you. But once you pull off that last
[1:54:59] pedal, that'll tell you what it is.
[1:55:02] And and that's what you do. You just He
[1:55:03] loves me. He loves me not. Well, you
[1:55:06] know, uh, you know what the trick is to
[1:55:07] it? Depends on what kind of flower you
[1:55:09] get. Cuz some flowers got an odd number
[1:55:12] of petals. Some flowers got an even
[1:55:14] number of petals. So, you can rig it.
[1:55:16] You can get it to if you really want to
[1:55:17] find out he loves you, you just got to
[1:55:19] know what kind of flower you're dealing
[1:55:20] with. I'm preaching to you now. Amen.
[1:55:23] Once you can get if you could just get
[1:55:24] that revelation down in your heart that
[1:55:26] doesn't matter what you come from or
[1:55:28] what you're going through now, but
[1:55:30] you're a predestinated seed of God. Let
[1:55:32] the message give you that revelation,
[1:55:34] friends. Find out what kind of a flower
[1:55:36] you are. Amen. And it'll deliver you
[1:55:38] from all of this legalistic
[1:55:40] condemnation. Amen. There's too many
[1:55:42] people sitting in messes churches. Amen.
[1:55:45] On Sunday, he loves me. But on Monday,
[1:55:47] he loves me not. On Wednesday, he loves
[1:55:50] me. On on on Thursday, he loves me not.
[1:55:53] When brother Matt's preaching, he loves
[1:55:55] me. When the guest minister's here, he
[1:55:56] loves me not. Amen. Friends, I'm so sick
[1:55:59] of seeing God's people bound down under
[1:56:01] he loves me loves me not religion. Amen.
[1:56:04] When this message is screaming out and
[1:56:07] saying, "I loved you before there was
[1:56:09] sin, before there were mistakes, before
[1:56:12] you ever had a struggle. I loved you and
[1:56:15] I chose you and I planted a seed of
[1:56:18] purpose in you." Oh, he loves you,
[1:56:20] friends. He loves you. I'm closing on
[1:56:23] that. Amen. But you got to know that he
[1:56:25] loves you. You got under you got to
[1:56:27] listen to the real voice of this message
[1:56:28] in the bride of Jesus Christ. Amen. When
[1:56:31] when Sister Destiny gets up and sings,
[1:56:33] you find out he loves you. Hey, why?
[1:56:35] Because you see the expression. Amen.
[1:56:37] You're smelling the fragrance. When
[1:56:39] brother Matt preaches, Amen. you and he
[1:56:41] gets in the pulpit and preaches like a
[1:56:43] man on fire. It's something your heart
[1:56:45] says, "Oh yes, he loves me. He loves
[1:56:47] me." Amen. Brother Mark give you a nice
[1:56:49] encouraging word. You find out he loves
[1:56:51] me. Amen. Somebody Somebody just uh
[1:56:54] shake your hand. You come to church
[1:56:55] feeling discouraged, but somebody give
[1:56:57] you a real loving handshake and a hug
[1:56:58] around the neck. Oh yeah, he loves me.
[1:57:01] He loves me. I put on a tape and you
[1:57:04] hear that good evening friends. Amen.
[1:57:06] And that presence comes into the room.
[1:57:07] Oh, he loves me. He loves me. He loves
[1:57:10] me. Hallelujah. It's a message of love.
[1:57:14] It's a message of grace.
[1:57:17] It's a message of purpose.
[1:57:21] How many would just want to receive it
[1:57:22] in that way? Amen. God, thank you for
[1:57:24] your love. Thank you for loving me when
[1:57:26] I was unlovable. Thank you for the
[1:57:28] expression of your heart. Thank you for
[1:57:31] the blossom. Thank you for the
[1:57:33] fragrance. Let's all stand today.
[1:57:36] Thank you for being welcoming today.
[1:57:38] Amen.
[1:57:40] Oh, he loves me. He loves me. He loves
[1:57:44] me.
[1:57:46] Brother Brandham preached, "I know my
[1:57:47] redeemer liveth."
[1:57:49] Speaking of the resurrection of Jesus,
[1:57:51] he said there's nothing can destroy it.
[1:57:54] It's been planted.
[1:57:56] It's been planted and it is the seed of
[1:57:59] God.
[1:58:01] Friends, that's the
[1:58:03] brother said if the bride could ever
[1:58:05] recognize who she is, the rapture will
[1:58:08] go.
[1:58:09] He didn't say it would come. He said it
[1:58:12] would go. So, who are you really? Say,
[1:58:15] "Brother Nathan, I I'm afraid of missing
[1:58:17] the rapture. You are the resurrection
[1:58:18] and the life. That Jesus Christ on the
[1:58:21] inside of you, that's that's a that's
[1:58:23] that's the whole point of a lily is to
[1:58:26] preach that sermon of resurrection.
[1:58:28] Says, look, when you see what's being
[1:58:30] expressed here in this life, you find
[1:58:32] out that there's a quality here. There's
[1:58:34] an eternal quality. You take this body
[1:58:37] and put it in the ground. But when
[1:58:39] resurrection morning comes around, it'll
[1:58:42] come. It'll come forth. You can't keep
[1:58:44] anything in the ground that serves God's
[1:58:46] purpose.
[1:58:47] And neither can sin keep it down.
[1:58:49] Neither can discouragement keep it down.
[1:58:51] Neither can hurts keep it down. I don't
[1:58:54] know where you're at in your life today.
[1:58:57] You might be just a such a young
[1:58:59] Christian,
[1:59:00] just freshly born again, and you're down
[1:59:03] there in the muck, and all of a sudden
[1:59:05] you you you're just pushing up against
[1:59:07] filthy things in your life and trying to
[1:59:09] push up out of that. Oh, don't don't
[1:59:12] don't get discouraged. Just keep
[1:59:15] listening to that little law of life.
[1:59:16] That that voice on the inside. Keep
[1:59:18] listening to it. Amen. It's reaching for
[1:59:20] higher things. That's the That's the
[1:59:22] seed. That's the seed. Trust it now.
[1:59:24] Trust it. Yield to it. Let it push for
[1:59:27] You might be a young person. You're just
[1:59:29] being You feel the current. You feel the
[1:59:30] pressure. Feel like you're drowning
[1:59:33] sometimes, but don't stop. Don't quit.
[1:59:35] You can't You're not a seaweed. Amen.
[1:59:37] You're a lily just like that one that
[1:59:38] you're looking at up there. Amen. And
[1:59:40] their life's in full blossom and you're
[1:59:42] just a little sprout. Amen. But you're
[1:59:44] still a lily.
[1:59:46] Just trust that law of life. You might
[1:59:49] be you might be somebody who's who come
[1:59:51] into maturity in your Christian walk,
[1:59:53] but something happened to you. You got
[1:59:55] frostbit.
[1:59:57] You got hurt by somebody or something.
[2:00:00] You find out, well, Brother Nathan,
[2:00:02] honestly, I'm just a little bit closed
[2:00:04] up and I'm not giving out that sweetness
[2:00:08] that I'm not bringing forth that
[2:00:09] fragrance like I used to. Oh, then it's
[2:00:12] the same law. It's the same law. Just
[2:00:16] yield to that seed life. How many would
[2:00:18] do it? Brother Ram said, "It's the seed
[2:00:20] of God. It's a purpose of God to give us
[2:00:22] the blessed Holy Spirit. It's the
[2:00:24] purpose of God to show us signs and
[2:00:25] wonders and miracles. It's the purpose
[2:00:27] of God and nothing can destroy it. All
[2:00:30] powers of hell might wager against it,
[2:00:32] but it will prevail. We have God's
[2:00:34] eternal per promise."
[2:00:36] Oh, he said there may be things that
[2:00:38] look like it would be destroyed, but it
[2:00:39] can never be destroyed.
[2:00:42] It is the purpose of God to see that it
[2:00:44] will prevail. Then he said, "It's not up
[2:00:47] to me."
[2:00:49] Thank God. It's not up to you whether it
[2:00:52] will be destroyed or not. It's not in
[2:00:55] your hands now. It's up to God. And we
[2:00:58] can rest assured on it. He said, "God
[2:00:59] will never let our heritage be destroyed
[2:01:02] for it's his purpose to give it to us."
[2:01:04] Let's bow our heads now.
[2:01:07] Lord Jesus, I thank you, Lord, for the
[2:01:10] welcome spirit, Lord, with these people.
[2:01:13] And I thank you, Lord,
[2:01:15] for getting to stand here and look out
[2:01:17] across your bouquet, Lord. Lord, if
[2:01:19] there be somebody here, Lord,
[2:01:22] who hasn't quite caught,
[2:01:25] Lord, what the message is trying to get
[2:01:26] across to them. They don't know, Lord,
[2:01:29] how important they are to you. They
[2:01:31] don't know, Lord, that they're a flower
[2:01:33] in your bouquet. I pray, Lord, you would
[2:01:36] encourage that heart. Lord, for people
[2:01:39] that are struggling, Lord, those of us,
[2:01:41] Lord, that we're not on top of
[2:01:42] everything. I pray, Father, that Lord,
[2:01:45] that law of life would just begin to
[2:01:47] brute over us now. Lord, let the
[2:01:49] presence of the sun come into this
[2:01:51] place, Lord, that we could feel you
[2:01:53] above us drawing us up higher, Lord. And
[2:01:56] I pray Lord we would we would just uh
[2:01:58] that that life within us would just push
[2:02:00] Lord and push forth, grow a little
[2:02:03] higher. I pray Lord we'd be closer to
[2:02:05] you when we leave this place than we
[2:02:07] were when we came. I pray a week from
[2:02:09] now Lord we'd be come into more
[2:02:11] expression than we are currently.
[2:02:13] Father, I pray for growth. Lord, I pray
[2:02:16] for spiritual maturity. Lord, I I pray,
[2:02:19] Lord, that you continue to prosper this
[2:02:21] word. Bless this ministry, Lord. These
[2:02:23] men and women of God, Father, that are
[2:02:27] bring Lord showing forth the fragrance
[2:02:29] of the message of the hour in this
[2:02:31] place, in this community. Oh God, that's
[2:02:34] all we want to be is flowers in your
[2:02:36] bouquet. Lord, when we look at this
[2:02:38] fragile human life, Lord, we find out
[2:02:41] there's not many days to live this human
[2:02:43] life. Lord, youth is so fleeting. Life
[2:02:46] is so fleeting, Lord. The years pass by
[2:02:49] and nothing lasts, Lord. But let us do
[2:02:51] something for you. Let us do something
[2:02:54] here in time which will echo in
[2:02:56] eternity. I pray that we would live
[2:02:58] lives of purpose for you, Father. And
[2:03:00] Lord, I pray that every one of us would
[2:03:03] be edified and encouraged today, Lord,
[2:03:05] as we consider the lily. Thank you,
[2:03:07] Lord, for your goodness and grace in
[2:03:10] Jesus name. Amen. Amen. Would you pray?
[2:03:16] In the presence
[2:03:22] of the king.

[2:10:28] that tremendous? You realize that every
[2:10:31] one of us, brother M said, is the divine
[2:10:33] love of God. The very thing that caused
[2:10:36] him to to create and caused him to to,
[2:10:42] as John would write, he loved the world
[2:10:44] so much that he would send his only
[2:10:45] begotten son. That same love that
[2:10:47] brought that out of God is in every one
[2:10:49] of us. And I believe that this morning.
[2:10:52] And I believe that's why that that we
[2:10:54] draw from one another. I think that's
[2:10:56] why Paul said to encourage one another
[2:10:58] daily and edify one another. We're
[2:11:00] drawing from the love of God. That's why
[2:11:02] we're pulling the petals off of that off
[2:11:04] of that flower. That's why you pull out
[2:11:07] of one another and you need each other.
[2:11:09] And be let me tell you what it never
[2:11:11] does. You know, he was talking about
[2:11:12] that I love you and I love you not. But
[2:11:14] you know, God is love. Brother Bram said
[2:11:16] you ought to be able to find Christ in
[2:11:18] every scripture in the Bible, every
[2:11:20] verse. It don't matter where you read.
[2:11:22] And and you could take any verse,
[2:11:23] Brother West, and you pull out of it.
[2:11:25] Never one time will you ever pull
[2:11:27] anything out of the word of God that
[2:11:28] says, "I love you." Not. It's always
[2:11:30] going to say, "I love you. I love you. I
[2:11:32] love you. I love you. I love you." And
[2:11:34] that's what we ought to pull out of each
[2:11:36] other. I love you. I love you. I love
[2:11:38] you. I love you. I love you. That ought
[2:11:40] be any bitterness, any hatred, any
[2:11:42] jealousy, any malice among any one of
[2:11:44] us. It ought to be the love of God that
[2:11:46] is portraying out of our lives. Do you
[2:11:48] believe that this morning? If you got
[2:11:51] God in you, then you got God to give.
[2:11:53] Amen. What are you what are you giving
[2:11:55] out? What savor? What what what scent?
[2:12:00] Amen. This is what a powerful message
[2:12:02] our brother spoke. I say, Lord, may it
[2:12:05] be pleasing unto you. May people be able
[2:12:08] to draw from me the love of God. Amen.
[2:12:10] Isn't that what you want? Somebody to
[2:12:11] draw that out of your life. And
[2:12:13] everywhere you go, people see that.
[2:12:15] Amen. as leaders and we're preachers and
[2:12:19] teachers and deacons and Sunday school
[2:12:21] teachers and trustees and prayer
[2:12:25] warriors and singers. Every one of us
[2:12:28] people ought to be able to draw the love
[2:12:30] of God out of you. And if they're
[2:12:31] drawing something else, something ain't
[2:12:32] right. Amen. Be so filled with the love
[2:12:35] of God that that's what we see in you.
[2:12:37] Amen. Isn't that our desire today? Do
[2:12:39] you love the Lord? How many appreciates
[2:12:41] brother Nathan for coming and speaking
[2:12:44] his heart? Amen.
[2:12:48] Amen. How How many like to have him come
[2:12:50] back? Amen. We'll we'll just
[2:12:54] Amen.
[2:12:57] They gave you a standing ovation,
[2:12:59] brother. That's just tremendous. Well,
[2:13:01] we'll try not to wait another seven
[2:13:02] years to get him to come back. Amen. We
[2:13:05] just appreciate his ministry and
[2:13:07] appreciate what he had, how the Lord
[2:13:10] used him this morning. What a powerful
[2:13:12] message. Amen. Brother Mark, would you
[2:13:13] care to come and and sing for us this
[2:13:16] morning? Amen. We're going to sing this
[2:13:18] just before we go. Amen.
[2:13:27] This world may press me down
[2:13:33] and change my glad to sad.

[2:13:45] easy always.
