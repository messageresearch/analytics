and made a big change in us and our ministry and just a few years later we had brother Wayne and I had had it on our heart and it was something that was on my heart and it was something that was on his heart and so when we came together about it it just seemed to seemed to be the right time and and so we we had we had came over and looking for places and different areas just for a place that we could have a family camp a typ meeting where people could come I know there's a lot of Youth meetings and and everybody drops off their kids and they and they just have a time but there not a lot of places where families can go and have that kind of meeting so we just had it on our heart to do it and and and not to not for the purpose of any church but just to to establish the message in the hearts of Believers and we we' had this meeting as a as a as a a foundation or or a platform just to edify the message to the hour in people's hearts and so brother Wayne has been spending all year getting ready for this meeting so there's there's no limit to what God can do and there ain't no telling what God has in store but I just want to say as we're opening the meeting I appreciate the

with the children of God Amen U we want to tonight to uh we're going to be looking to the Book of Joshua here and uh also the look at Ephesians I going to read the first nine verses of the Book of Joshua if you can and uh I think it's a tremendous reading here now after the death of Moses the servant of the Lord it came to pass that the Lord spake unto Joshua the son of n Moses is Minister saying Moses my servant is dead now therefore arise and go over this Jordan thou and all the people under the L which I will give to them even to the children of Israel every place that the soul of your foot shall fed upon that I have given unto you as I said unto Moses now from the Wilderness and leanon even unto the Great River the river Euphrates and the land of the hites and the great sea toward the Ping down to the sun shall be your Cod there shall not any man be able to stand before thee all the days of thy life as I was with Moses so I will be with thee I shall not fail thee nor forsake thee don't you know Joshua was having the fit right there amen this is a God's covenant Commission Joshua right here now there shall not be any man stand before thee all the days of thy life neither as I was with Moses so I will be with thee I will not fail thee nor forsake thee be strong and of good courage For unto this people sht thou divide for an inheritance in the land which I swear unto their fathers to give them now here's the commission over Joshua's life all right I'm giving you the job josua to divide this land under the people who I promised it to now now never mind there's people living on it never mind there's wall cities and Giants and there's going to be a lot of battles and all that that has nothing to do with the commission he's been given he's been told to divide this land and give it to these people who I said can have and only thou be strong and very courageous that thou May to observe to do all according to the law which Moses my servant commanded thee now turn not from to the right hand but to the left that thou mayest Prosper wheresoever thou Hest now this book of the law shall not depart out of thy mouth but thou shall meditate therein day and night that thou mayest observe to do according to that is written therein for then thou sh make thy way prosperous and thou sht have good good success have not I commanded thee be strong and of a good courage Be not Afraid neither be thou dism for the Lord God thy God is with thee wheresoever thou goest amen let's turn to the book of Ephesians if we can and let's read the book of Ephesians and we'll read the first nine verses of EP now Paul an apostle of Jesus Christ to the will of God to the Saints which are of emphasis into the faithful in Christ Jesus now Grace be to you and peace from God our Father for the Lord Jesus Christ blessed be the God and the father of our Lord Jesus Christ who have blessed us with all spiritual blessings in Heavenly places now according as he has chosen Us in him before the foundation of the world that we should be holy without lame before your love having predestinated us unto the adoption of children by Jesus Christ to himself according to the good pleasure of his will now to the praise of the glory of his wherein he had made us accepted in the blood in whom we have Redemption through his blood the Forgiveness of sins according to the riches of his grace where abounded toward us in all wisdom and Prudence having made known unto us the mystery of his will according to the good pleasure which he have purposed in himself amen uh if we could let's just bow our hearts this afternoon for a word of prayer most gracious father we thank you this evening Lord for the Gathering of this Congregation of people around your word and Lord we've congregated here in this area Lord just something Lord that we felt may be a neutral Place Lord for hearts to come together for believers Lord that father we just want to be thankful tonight that we could be identified Lord Lord not just by the church we attend or Lord by the by the ideas that we gather with but Lord that blood tag that you have given to your children Lord we come together tonight Lord on level ground each one of us comeing to the Cross Lord where there's no big big ones no little ones there's no important ones there's no simple ones Lord we're all one in you and we stand at the cross needing each one of us the same thing from you but Lord we ask you that while we stand up and walk away with the blood upon our hearts Lord that you would direct us Lord to the things that you would have us to do the places you would have us to go now tonight as we enter your word we ask that you would bless these meetings may you bless them Lord for this visible audience for those that will be watching tonight I pray and Lord whoever would watch this in the future may it be taken with the intention Lord that you put in our hearts that it would be only a blessing and encouragement to your children we ask for these things father in the mighty name of Jesus Christ we pray amen and amen God bless you tonight amen if you just had your seats we'd like to talk to you a little bit about this uh about this if uh if we can we're going to be talking to you about the Joshua generation amen but I I think it's a powerful thing uh we call it the Joshua generation of course what we're talking about is we're talking about the generation after Moses uh who who actually didn't just uh wasn't just the children of Israel but they were the children of Israel who were moving into the promises which God had gave them it was a it was a season of change a generation of change change it was a generation moving not receiving promises but moving into promises and getting what God had promised other Generations they were now receiving amen they wasn't there to write scripture they were there to fulfill scripture they wasn't there amen uh looking for a prophet they had a prophet they had the word they knew what they were to do and they were just going to move into amen amen and we want to just take a minute tonight to uh maybe as we introduce some of these things to you I believe that it would help us as a New Testament Church as a people to recognize uh that brother Ral preach four parts on the message adoption if you have not familiarized yourself with those it'd be good for you uh there's actually four different sermons brother teaches on it it's amazing sermons uh and in these brother Ram actually tells us in the first uh book adoption he tells us something powerful and he says that this book of Ephesians in my opinion is one of the greatest books books of the New Testament it leaves us where Calvinism runs out on the Lim and arenium runs out on the limb but the book of Ephesians draws it all together and positionally places the believer amen now y'all know one side arminianism is legalism and that's about you work your way into into the things of God if you're working in a certain way you get something if you don't work a certain way you don't get it and then on the other side Calvinism goes out into the side if you're predestinated why try any right amen why have an Al call why have Services why have Evangel they go way out of the other side what's going to happen is going to happen amen but the prophet of God said the truth is right in between amen a predestinated people by Grace receives from God and he gives them a free gift of Grace and they have eternal salvation so it's not what you work it's what you receive from God he said that then it comes together on love right amen that you love God and and and that you're moving on so this book of Ephesians actually begins to take people who are already born again and begins to show them where they belong in Christ now the prophet says it like this he says in adoption he says this I'd like to say this that this book of Ephesians perfectly parallels the Old Testament Joshua Ephesians the book of Ephesians it's a perfect type see I typ it with Joshua if you've notied the Israel was brought up out of Egypt and there were three stages of their Journey one stage was leaving he said the next stage was the journey and the next stage was in Canaan he said now these Canan does not represent the age of a millennium he said it only represents the age of the Overcomer it is the dispensation of overcoming because Canaan they killed and burned and took cities and everything else amen so in Canaan is where they inherited possessions but they had to overcome to get them and that's why the New Testament Bible would say to them that overcome shall inherit all things right so this is an inheritance uh that God has given amen but it's something you're going to have to This Book of Joshua actually it's a book actually it's a book now of redemption the Old Testament Joshua and we have to consider it the book of redemption because it's a Redemption has two parts See Redemption always has two parts it's an out of and an into it takes two parts of redemption see now Moses represented the law which brought them out of Egypt and Joshua represents the grace that took them in the promised land amen see the law and the grace were two after different aspects of God's command the law brought them out under Moses but Joshua took them in he said now this represents something for our day now they are all the way back in the scripture Moses bringing them out Joshua putting them in and brother said it's going to repr represents something for our day it represents our journey amen their Egypt into the promised land represents Us coming out of chaos and going into the promised land or In My Father's House of many mansions and if it were not so I would not have told you amen amen you see it's God leading the church not into a natural land but into a spiritual inhabitance so into a spiritual land as a gentile we have a spiritual land the tells us in the adoption of course this is being positioned in the promise of the Holy Ghost is that right that's where our position lies is in the Holy Ghost we receive the baptism of the Holy Ghost and and that's a great experience in our lives but what we're looking for tonight is not just to experience the holy ghost in a birth but we're talking about the Holy Ghost positioning Us in the word to give us of Faith as a Sons and Daughters of the Living God you see what it is in Joel 2 he said I pour out my spirit there's your promise it's a spiritual promise do you see God in Ephesians 1 and3 said Paul said it like this after that you have heard the word of truth and you have trusted you receive the spirit of Promise that's it is a spirit of Promise in Luke 24:49 it was Jesus said go out under the upper room and receive the promise of my father of course he's talking about Isaiah 28 with the Bible We Stand another tongue will I speak under these people and this shall be the refreshing remember Jesus said the rest come unto me and I will give you rest said what is that rest it was zoy life amen he was going to give them zoy life he going to give them rest amen not wondering anymore if I lost or unsaved not wondering anymore am I going to make it am I not going to make it I'm talking about coming out of the land of wondering wondering one day to the next do I youall know yall know me been hearing me preach for years I believe in experience with God I believe in all calls I believe in getting yourself in the place with God but many of you sitting here tonight and received a new birth years ago many of you had the Holy Ghost a long time but the devil's been trying to run you around to figure out are you going to make a rapure you're not going to make a rapure you're going to be saved you're not going to be saved you have a good day so you feel way down up here you have a bad day and you feel way down here but there's got to come a time in your life when you take the of God and begin to live a solid Christian Life not up and down in the altars not in out of the world but to satisfy your soul upon the word of the Living God to stand amen when the weather's bad when the weather's good when the day is bad and the day is good you're just as saved on your bad day as you are on your good day I'm going in the Rapture of my bad day and on my good day because nothing amen that is day has anything to do with God's election upon your life and if you begin to believe like that you can live above the devil you can live above everything the enemy says according to your life I'm talking about a higher place in Christ set our feet up in Heavenly places amen you see it's a spiritual land the promise that's been given to this church is not a natural land it's a spiritual land it's not a natural but it's a spiritual that's why they call it a Promised Land just as God promised unto Abraham he would give him a land and Genesis the 12th chapter God told Abraham to get up out of Babylon amen out of that place of confusion right get up out of the valley of sheni get out of this city of confusion amen and move to a land which you don't even know about but a land that I'll give you and I'll get the seed after you and it'll be your land right because Abraham didn't need to stay down there in the valley of Shar and try to convince all of those pagans that there was only one God they wouldn't never believe it all his whole life would just be alive to fight so God said get out of this land and I'll make a nation under myself amen I'll make you see as the stars of the heavens as the Sands of the sea amen and thou sh be a blessing unto all people you see a powerful thing that God was promising this man if you just believe me if you just walk in me I'll give unto you this land in Genesis the 12th chapter God promised this his land God made the promise un them in Genesis 26 the Bible told us he said that God told his seed I will give me this land and I will give these countries and I will perform the oath that I swear un Abraham thy father and again in Genesis 28 he promises the seed Abram not just Abraham but the Seed of Abraham and I said the Lord God of Abraham thy father and the god of Isaac the land without th Li to thee I will give to thee thy seed Jacob even made the promise years later God said to land you're laying in I'll give it to you as a promise because God gave them the promised land that's why yah's having that war over there right now cuz he knows that's his land he knows that's his land as a Seed of Abraham he knows by the Jewish Line This land belongs to us no matter what the whole world says he knows he has a seed right to that land and his deed is not a deed written on any paper it is a deed by from almighty God the one that created the earth and the same thing tonight the very creator of the spirit of God is the one that gave you his spirit and gave you a position in that spirit and put you in a place that no devil whatever this position you again if you can hold to the word of God you see amen it's it's it's a very deep subject but I'll say to you like this Adam and Eve had a powerful position until Eve got to full in the ram of the word and she lost her place in inheritance amen and and and she forfeited her rights to that Garden is that right amen but God said I have another E I'll have another E that she will not Reas in this word she will not tell this word because she will be that way come on I'm not talk about you mising something I talk about who you are you are the word of the so I don't believe you de we are living manifestation of the word of the Living God have you ever seen that God anointed us and place in we're already in the wordness your positions what you're fulfilling tonight was written about thousands of years ago you begin to put your feet on that kind of gr right come on brother you begin to understand this belongs to me I was born from this is my name this is my inheritance this is my place you see the scripture tells us that this promise was given and it was passed on to the ages through Moses and Joshua Jacob and Isaac all these men even in Joshua 6 when Joshua was atent the walls of Jericho it was the Lord said unto him I have given thee this land Paul wrote In the book of Ephesians things that you're said in here with the now you might not maybe sometimes when you're really understand or catch but Paul is very quickly to you in the Book of Matthew the 20th chapter you can read where Jesus is there and there's two of his disciples and and the mother of Zeb and John Matthew 20 and and they said Lord would you allow my sons mother's prayers are powerful now would you allow my sons to sit at thy right hand and thy left hand to be baptized with your baptism to drink of your cup and he said well I'll let him drink of my cup and I let him be baptized I baptism but now these positions on my side with my prone said now it's not mind to give for these things have already been given they've already been granted by my father to another person and other man picks that up and he says who is that graned to he said it's the Overcomer of the L age amen all the way in the days of Jesus he was saying no you can't have this position now but when the test come the same test that Jesus was going through in Matthew the 14th chapter this bride would go through a test on the word and once the word was received amen that bride would be SE in the thr of almighty God and tonight Paul is telling us you will be lifted up into the Heavenly places and seated with God in the last days his positions were written back there but they were not fulfilled till down here now I can show it to you in another very beautiful uh ESS brother up and he says Isaiah now saw the heart of Satan and he said I will Ascend under the heavens and I will put myself above the stars of the heaven said that was the sons right and he wanted to come up into the North and make it to the throne that's why Satan wanted to get into the church cuz he going to make it to the throne and he knew the bride was going to the throne and God said I seen what was in your heart right but here in second Thessalonians Paul writes the same thing but then he shows that he says he sth in the temple of God acting as if he is God exalting himself above all that is called God now to you that's studying this I'll tell you what that is that's the Vindicated word of the edge the prophet said what Satan is doing is he's arguing with Vindicated word saying he's greater than God what what is it all that is called of God in the beginning was the word and the Word was with God the Word was God he said the Vindicated word and should be ruling right but Satan comes against that anytime you hear somebody say well brother man's wrong on that you know what he's doing he's exalting his opinion above A God Called Prophet let me tell you the spirit com Straight Out of Hell the devil's job to this word to a Believer the devil knows just one word of this message he put you in his hand we the kingdom of God when the spirit the word power H yes sir man said the devil's position said Isaiah saw it in his heart he said Paul saw him in position but it's not till today that William brandom said he's now the god of his evil agent and he has achiev said he has achieved his desires by devaluing the word if he achieved his desires by valuing the world then there is god brother who's been wanting a church that he can fully manifest himself in he said he has now achieved a church on this rock I will will build my church Jesus prophesied that he do let me say something now that's no longer a prophecy the prophet is said he has now achieved his church I looking at a position by the message of the hour you [Applause] lost that's my she recognizes who she is and what she can do she will be in the mutal Army the adoption is not out in front of us the adoption is upon us to the is telling you who you are where you belong where you what of I'll be trying to twist that around too this pure word will set you next to God see these promises put you in position Joshua's job was to say to them people this is your portion now over there under Moses they could have took binoculars and looked over the river and said that part's mine some said well that part's mine some said well that part's mine hey but listen Joshua's job was to walk them over in the land and say this part is your part and we now find that Joshua has been risen up again in this age absolutely you see it's a time a time of God spiritual moving now we recognize that there actually is a movement in the end time amen that that would make the church move warm and formable it would just take all the anointing all the power of God away from brother man says it that this Apostolic age will not cease see as long as God is called God is still giving the Holy Ghost he's still worth it now I want you to watch something very clearly though had you been born under the time of Moses you would have been birthed your birth would have placed you in the wilderness right but after they crossed over in the Jordan the people that were born were born in the land now not there under Pentecost it was a new birth but when they were burned they were burned under confusion and no matter how long they liveed they remained in the age of confusion because it was the whole W but watch when God s a prophet people born we we still have new more babies but they birth into the land I Children s here I can to the because they had the answer and you might not know all the scriptures but you got the answer it it a great thing because there's a lot of people got all the script and no answer so they got a lot of questions but if you have the message you have the answer even you don't know all the scriptures you see this book that we're talking about tonight Joshua and Ephesians the Book of Joshua is the book of Ephesians of the New Testament so brother R says watch now this book is addressed to certain people this is not for everybody this is not for those who have not been born this is for people who have been born again and filled with the Holy Ghost now the prophet tells us this he says it's election he said now we're going to have to get on that real strong you didn't you didn't become a Christian by coincidence you become a Christian before you was in this world I ask I need your hand really if you're a Christian I don't want to see him all right see if you're a Christian then I'm not talking to you about getting born again right I'm talking about how you got where you are I'm talking about what put you where you are see you didn't just get a desire I'm going to come to the Altar and get saved and then if I do wrong then I'm going to be lost but said you did you come to the altar because you were a seed the start and had you not had a seed you could have never been born I'm not I'm not a theologian but I I I'm just a simple he but every person in here that is a human being started out as a seed in their father and they come here as a human being and if you was the seed you're not born come on if you thece you MN but if you he it proves if you say here it's proof there was a seed before there was a you and if you were a Christian that was a seed that made you a Christian election brother said you got to get on Christian he says not by coincidence before the world began before you were born God obained you to be a Christian from the garden of of the very Foundation is that right right before there was ever before you know anything there was a time that you knew but your mind is darken to that now your mind is darken to that now I hate to ask but if you can EQ this thing it's got too much Bas in it puts me T there it's just ear mon amen there was a time that you knew that but your mind is darkened to that now now watch but man is telling you you were there but you don't remember being there right but there's only one man on Earth that never ever knew that and he said glorify me the Lord whichs I have it for the world he was the Incarnate God and he can move back there and know what it is but our minds have been blackened but we were ordained and predestinated you know what that predestination means it means preol by God that's not skin I believe that St you but we better go over now turn over me to Ephesians 1 and let's read it he said I'm afraid you're missing in just thinking now listen closely we'll go down to the church in a few minutes now Paul is speaking addressing Ephesians 1 directly to the shoulder of the church and that's what we're doing tonight this is not for babies this is for grownups this is not for babies listen now this is not for that I think in and little babies he said I got one little back there he says they learn to walk bump fall down and get back up he said thought they were doing something great he said but one day but now I'm a man and I'm going to put away childish things we've got to come to full Doctrine I like little shouting meetings where we clap our hands and Shout have a good time have great powerful services and things and dance on the Bubbles as it were but when the show time comes you don't know where you're standing we've got to get back and find out let's find out what's making us do that let's get back to the foundation and see where we're at see the foundation Paul Apostle will of God he says see no Seminary sent me out the will of God sent me out now watch he dresing the faith in Christ Jesus not to The Sinner not to the baby them that are grown up who's he addressing not a bunch of babies to people that are sitting in Heavenly places that be blessed you know something you've been taught and you've been saved and I want to tell you what it's about a that amazing say hey we might as well settle this point you're Sav let talk about what that's about because if you really have that discussion by the word then you're not going to Wonder tomorrow standing with God Amen now this book of Ephesians is not to everybody it's not for everybody good amen according to Genesis 17 God made his Covenant with Abraham and his seed that would be after him right Amen to I se I will establish it the Bible said let me just read Genesis 17 for th neither shall thy name anymore be called ABR but th name Shall be Called Abraham for the father of many nations and I will make thee exceeding fruitful and I will make the Nations and kings and shall come out of thee and I will establish my Covenant well then said that word establish should be predestinate so you can understand it I will establish or predestinate my Covenant between me and thee and thy seed after thee and generations for an Everlasting Covenant to be of God unto thee and to thy seed after thee and I will give unto thee and thy seed after the the land th a stranger and that land of Canan for an everlasting possession I will be their God now now we look at that and we look back there and say then all of the Jews are the Sea of Abraham but in Galatians chapter 3 and verse 16 Paul said now to Abraham and his seed were promises made and he saith not unto seeds as of many but as of one and that seed is Christ all right now watch unto the seed were all promises made many promises one seed Abraham had a lot of kids yeah Abraham knew Isaac was the natural blessing right Isaac but Isaac was not the true Seed of Abraham the Royal Seed of Abraham was not born in Abraham's day but Abraham saw his day but he live in his day but wa but Jesus when Jesus came what the true Seed of Abraham and through that seed all the nations of the Earth would be blessed now through Jesus in Christ would we become the Seed of Abraham that's why in Ephesians he said unto the faithful which are in Christ Jesus now how do we get in Christ we are baptized into Christ by the Holy Ghost right the Holy Ghost births you and I to deity it takes you from being just a human being to being a son or daughter of God making you a God man or a god woman I know you just think you're a home savior but that's not really true that's not really true there is a part of you that is deity that has been birth or ignited by the baptism of the spirit and now you are in Christ amen and being in Christ you are Abraham seed and you're heir to every promise that belongs to Jesus Christ that's why Paul says in the Book of Romans there that we are air to God and join hes with Jesus Christ so everything that God gave Jesus he gave you and I through Jesus is every part come on Matthew 17 took me to the top of the mountain and said this is my beloved son hear you him and he positioned Jesus as the son who was appointed unto the air of all things and through that son comes all salvation comes all heing comes all anointing come all blessing and we can get into him by the baptism of the Holy Ghost and if we're in that tonight everything God promised in Jesus prom so we ask ourselves tonight is the bride predestinated amen see it makes the word seed the same water see the church today is a bride predestinated did God say he would have a ride without spot a wrinkle then it's predestinated if God said he'd have one yes sir before he had one sir then he was saying there's going to be one yes sir see and Christ was predestinated he was the royal Seed of Abraham and what did it do when the spirit came on Christ he bore a record of the word of God hey and when the water spirit falls on the word sea the Royal Sea of Abraham faith in God's words will produce the same crop amen my goodness what is the Seed of Abraham now I'm going to answer a couple of these direct questions what is the Seed of Abraham now it's not his flesh Paul said Jew the Jew outward is not Jew on now it's the Jew inward what is the Seed of Abraham those that believe the whole world word amen amen my goodness is this Prophet something else yes sir what is the see Abram amen amen it's them that jump the highest oh it's them that scream the loud sir come on church if that's what we're basing these things amen the first b day you have you wck up this ain't basing there we going higher we're going a place who standing on the infallible word of a living God if you ever get your feet on that word you can shout loud you can SC High because every day is a day of your life it a't have be feel it's what you believe I believe we are the children of God I believe we were in for the foundations of the world when the sons of God was sh Joy that's right now all yall know how I feel about sh and dancing I'm most emotional person in here amen you can't put it on that if you put it on that you're going to be a miserable creature yes sir the devil's going to whip you every day of your life but sometimes you just don't feel Sav come on we might as get it out sir sometimes you don't feel s but are you sa my Bible said them that are in Christ are sealed unto the day [Applause] of when God SE side he said word his word and he said now you know I'm telling you the truth that's why he told the story about Saul meeting meeting Sam that's why he told the story cuz he said Saul got out there Disobedience but he wasn't going to hell he just had a premature dad right yeah good now what we're talking about is establishing C I got to go got to get off amen I feel pull I got to go okay amen what is the Seed of Abraham not believe the whole word of God regardless of what denomination or Papa or mama or anybody says they believe the whole world and I will establish my Covenant right now yes sir this wait a second I'll make my Covenant right now with anybody who believes the whole word I'll make a covenant with anybody that will stand on this word look at this he said he would predestinate the Covenant with the seed in each generation that will believe it there you are Seed of Abraham I will establish it with a seed amen amen what is the evidence of that seed believing the word of your age now everybody wants the evidence of the Holy Ghost there's only one evidence that we can find only one evidence it was the life of this message accepting this word somebody say well now you're saying just believe the prophet you got it that wasn't what I said but once a person receives the Holy Ghost there's only one evidence that got can I can I place it different for you there's only one absolute if you went to a Baptist altar they put your name on a a book as an Evidence you got something because they recognize in the church what you did as salvation right all right but when God gives a man the Holy Ghost the evidence of that spirit being in your life is faith comes into your heart for this message if you're not teach the truth folks the message of the hour is saying who is and who ain't yes sir this is the absolute of who go got a traffic now pull up I don't care what if you're on one side of the other it does not ask he's in the Cars one side goes one side stays it's all up to that light and we've got a Al in this age and you I I come from God one through the word of God for this I'm talking about up here in a place where you can wh [Applause] Dev they're already in there I'm talking to this congregation this morning people that's already in there right now in paragraph 220 says it's like this who did it God and when did he do it before the world began and watch God did something before the world begin right he said but then he said you come in an illegitimate birth through Eve right into corruption on brother before your birth you were a part of God you come through a channel that brought you into the Earth illegitimate now y'all know some people's got a bunch of doctrines on illegitimate if if you ain't got the right parents you can't come in [Music] rtion tell the truth if you wasn't raised right you wasn't part of the message I don't even know if you make it if your dad's a drk or amen if you come up out of a Catholic church or you had some kind of background rough maybe you didn't have an education but you got to have all these pedigrees According to some people got to come up under certain Ministries you got C Church cry this C Place been nons I don't care how youor make your parents you were part of [Applause] God word said like this he said we were all illegitimately born through Adam he said that through Christ we have leg God made us all legitimate SE then if we come through an illegitimate birth ease corruption making all the children and subject to death then the Sovereign God has to make a way to redeem his children that's right all the father has given me will come now God making a way to redem his children yeah now I don't have time to preach it I want you to catch my thought God making a way right remember Daniel the lies diduh see Daniel needed a fence but God come down in the pillar of fire he made a way that wasn't a fence but God made a way he made a fence his own way right right amen Moses needed a bridge cross the Red Sea God made a way he open the Red Sea brother said he actually them to come to that point to show those people that when God needs to make a way he can make a way when there is no right so God made a way we we look at Calvary and we see Jesus bleeding and dying we see the blood and the spit and the nail Stars we what a horrible scene you say what's God doing making a way that was God's way of making a way right you see we brand come on the earth Kentucky IL No Education meeting an angel come out no denomination about them men were mad that kind of gift was in that kind of man they wanted somebody they can work with a little bit they wanted somebody who would give the rules of and include more people you know just set aside some of that harsh Holiness teaching and some of them ideas of Doctrine they wanted somebody if that gift could have just been in the land they wanted but it was God making away because God knew denomination can never put the bride in her position hallelujah hallelujah was going to send the prophet among who had no manmade connections who had no denominational parents who had no favors to play give certain group what was it it was God making a way to position this church [Applause] in the Paradox 1965 brother said used to be you can hand me a Bible and I can say what is my commission he said I can drop the Bible and we fall open with Joshua the first chapter yeah now that's a that's a heavy Bible and I'll tell you this Joshua's only a couple chapters in so there's some anti-ra stuff going on there some it opened Joshua the first chapter every time he asked what's my commission he dro the Bible and would open to Joshua the first chapter wow he said one day I was in my study and a vision he said appears and he said there was a Bible come down out of the sea would that be something a Bible starts down out of the ceiling and he s a hand with a collar of cuff on it went down the first nine verses of the Book of Joshua what was it it was commissioning William Brown to do what Joshua did right in the Old Testament he was being commissioned by God he wasn't commissioned by the Baptist they threw him out he wasn't commissioned by the assemblies they threw him out but God himself commissioned the prophet because they were children that came into and somebody [Applause] had you are in the word back to the word the word is your [Applause] identity was it the prophet was being told to the Lord in the Paradox cross this Jordan y'all remember the story he appeared and I'll go through some of these things later but I want to just catch this and going the prophet said he had a dream he stand on the map of Palestine he said it's broken three pieces the River Jordan was there he said I had come two3 of the journey yeah but he said over the Jordan was the last part of the journey and he said they told me that's where all the promises are I don't know if y'all realize this but first P second there was a Jordan and then there was a promise somebody got mad at me for this one time but I'll just go ahead and tell you teaching for Doctor I'll tell you to help you con I'm a hill I understand hilles lay down the statue of perfect man and go to walking yeah you go to walking from Ephesus all the way to Lea what do you come up to there's a little stram there yes sir there's a little Gap there somebody had to take us over that Gap into that headship that headship amen was where we came from our identity is in the headship of God took a prophet to bring a head back to the Earth we are not a l SE group of people we are the original seed this is Le but we are not Le we are the First Church of the Living our name Jesus Christ some people that get so mad at me over these things I'm sorry it's still true said well there's not more than Seven Cities but there is actually yes sir there's an epes right there City ephus and there's an Ephesus age there's a city of samna and there's a samna ag and there's a city of Leia and there's Le you know why they call it Leia don't you because it reflects the spirit of that City amen but there's another city that's not on this Earth there a New Jerusalem that and the word we the Jesus Christ it's another city it's the New Jerusalem out that City the L is the the streets and don't B son come on church it's not keeping the days and news it's not keeping up character and laws and denominations it's the bride and the Bri GL be to God every promise is in that promise who's going to go over there brother say the Caleb and Joshua outfit yeah the rest of them man had their opportunity yes but they came to a c and what they did was they looked over in that land and they said there's too many Giants over there they have they have the reality to say that it is a land with milk honey right but there's wall cities yes sir and giant yes sir so they decided to look at the opposition rather than the promise sir Caleb and Joshua could care less what was over them they were looking at a promise look at Giants I can't see no Giants they said look at the walls I can't see no walls cuz all they had eyes for is the promise there is and Abraham seeks to possess the P of the eny because they believe the word of God don't make no difference what the enemy has said according about your life what does the word say about your life it don't make this is going to happen and this going to happen that's going to happen I don't hear Satan I don't believe Satan he's alive to [Applause] start it was that josua out yes sir said the rest of stopped in the land and they couldn't go over it and the difference was one looked at the word one looked at the other position you see these men were looking at the promise because the promise spoke of them their identity was in the promise of Abraham is is that beautiful I don't oh I don't have time the promise was in there now where where was their names where was the where was the tribe where was the name that they were living under come from anyhow it came from God in inspiration Genesis 30 hundreds of years before these men were on the earth these tribes were actually the sons of Abraham Abraham had a son right Isaac and then out of Isaac comes Jacob and they change Jacob's name to and Israel has how many sons so Israel the nation is named after Jacob Israel and the tribes of know after the tribes of Sons of Jacob so it would be like uh somebody having F kids and every state in the United States was named one of those kids and they said where do you live said well my name's arkans right my name's theer my name's Ohio so they lived in the place that they were named for yeah and those names wasn't something somebody just come up with but even in their birth pains the mothers cried out those names under inspiration in bir their names were screamed over their forefathers these kids ain't even been born yet 400 years in Egypt and they still carry those names and every time they speak one of those names it is a name speaking of something that's going to happen in the future but now the name has come together the land and the people are coming together the prophecy and the people are coming together the is BEC posi the word is word the is not just a denomination she [Applause] word SP of my bride Pi it up and for the foundations of the world a bride Who was appointed under adoption in the last days who know what God thought we were there but our mind was darken to it how you going to know it I I this is one of my favorite little things right here I like to think about this you said it ain't possible that we could be there and not know it but this is possible every person in this room had a birth experience none of you remember it right good you were definitely at the hospital yes sir and you were definitely born yes sir and you were probably 3 years old before you had your real first memory but because you know your mom and you know your dad they have gave you memories that you don't remember but you receive them as they are your own memory you tell people your birthday you don't know that's your birthday somebody told you that was your birthday but now their memory has become your memory what God has told you you first Corinthians the Bible tells us in the agent Divine love when it comes you will be know go as you have been G somebody's going to tell you the story God's going to have a way to get you back in the world and it'll take a it'll take somebody who can see the mind of God and tell you what was happening nobody knows that your Baptist Church don't know itation don't know it the Pentecostals don't know it God all knows it but when the seals begin to be opened up if there was an identity of who you were the world as it begins to unfold it begin to speak your [Applause] name I hear Mama my mother is the word come on y'all know the E story I preach I hear Lama I came through a illegitimate way CH but I hear the only one nobody in the chicken D knew where an eagle comes from nobody can tell it how to get back but oh when you couldn't go to him he came to you this message came to you in the chaos IDE God [Applause] mer I want to read this is that a great warrior Joshua now there's not too many of you here most of you have accepted healing so forth amen and he said so I'm going to develop a lot of time to Bringing forth the word to encourage you and positionally place these people amen most of everybody in this room are Christians yes sir on I'm not trying to be save you but if you're saved some time or another you're going to have to start believing yourself you're going to have to start settling in the what God done for you yes sir good pre you imagine a 50y old if I had a bad day and I said I don't know Daddy you my dad had a bad week last week you might not be my dad this week come on people give too much they give too much to the dev come on all give too much trouble yeah brother R said I'm going to give a lot of of of of word here to encourage and position and place his people I feel led by the Holy Spirit to do it to let the people I say how many Christians are here tonight you raise your hand Christians no matter what church you belong to now about 99% and that was true here about 99% of you are Christians maybe there be eight or 10 people here maybe tonight that's not Christians I don't even think that's true here well now what must you do to that people but if you're Christians I mean and I been preaching Evangelical message that you need to get saved we've about called this conference in vain on now because we're trying to redo the first work again I can't say everybody's exactly what they need to be I got that but in this position of the church that we're in we have got to teach this message to our people this is when the church goes to their position yes sir now watch here we see this now watch brother man says it like this he said then there's he says what must the people do right you must positionally let them know what they are who they are and how to handle that evil and there's thousands of Chicago tonight Christians see then you're going to go out and be Warriors because you know you know where you're standing and you're going to meet the evil one now you can't meet that evil one until you're solid of who you are you better know where you're standing with that you see what it is you got to have a positive faith and brother said I believe it's right now that we are to break a complete understanding positionally of what we are in Christ you know brother said preaching will save the Lost he said but teaching positionally places them and we can never have the right Faith until positionally we know what we are the right kind of faith everything that we have is controlled by a law of Faith all the power you have depends upon the faith you have if you're still trying to figure out if you're going to be forgiven for what you done last year your faith is nothing it's a r on faith come on you can go so far but when you really come in front of that evil one he'll back you down every time but when you really getting settled in your heart that it's a finished work that day in Calvary and the blood of Jesus covers my sins you get that set down and you get there and you get to Rel your faith that faith that should come in your heart is a faith of the finish work I don't have any faith myself I don't have any faith in you but I got all the faith in the world that God P your price and made away you now that's the power of the church now is controlled by a law how much Faith you have how much power you can have will matter how much Faith you can have you see what it is amen if you begin to believe you can come to Mountain Moving Faith you can come to checkbook Authority Faith you can come to the kind of faith that the devil don't know what to do with you because it becomes faith brother says there's got to be an effort there's got to be not not the Ephesians there's got to be a moving into there's got to be an Ephesus see now to really have genuine Faith you absolutely have to leave everything that's contrary to the word behind you to enter into Faith words anything that says you can't do it you're going to have to leave it anything that says you can't be that Pride you're going to have to cross the Jordan and you're going to have to say you got to stay on that side as I going over here anything that says that you can't have the spoken word Authority you need to cross your Jordan and say Satan I to leave another lie that you going to speak about me at some time you have to come to the place you will only believe [Applause] work remember if you can get the people to not even cancer will stand in the way what is it we got to another Ephesians whether telling us intellectual demonstrations all educational programs has got to come to its Jordan we've got to have an Ephesians we've got to come out and we got to go into for this Exodus of the rapure what is it there's got to be an Ephesians to this do you realize brother places the Ephesians of the church in laa he says it very clearly we promis a lay to see a church that that's when the Ephesians would come the seven Church age now I don't have time to teach on all that but let's just get it clear okay real quick the seven Church age hasn't ended because it's Gentile dispensation but the bride has been lifted out of it by the word right when that ends it goes into tribulation and and Jews right so what we're looking at is that the hour has come the messenger of the age amen has brought when the seals open that's the time to go into because until it's open how you go into let me put it let me put it let me put it in my tongs how you going to eat a can of green beans till you open it how you going to believe the seals till they're open how are you going to find a d until God sends a prophet to tell you where you go that's right yall know you you know you s wait on your wife to come to the table tell you where we set cuz when the guys sit down they just mess everything up some said well if you guys sitting there you girls are sitting there kids are sitting here kind of helps everything right somebody had to put it in order that's right amen now help your mothers you just walked out of your house as a three-year-old lose and it pull everything off the shelf and they pulled everything down and everything's out the floor pots and P and shells and everything else is out there and you walk out now hey here you go please walk back in and say aah put it all back go ahead we'll give you a couple hours come back two hours you probably have a bigger mess and she might have some stuff put back and I bet it's going to be in the wrong place yeah because she don't know where it goes right that's good but Mama come back in the house yes sir and everything gets right back in the yes sir because she was the one that put it there to start and when God comes into the age and begins to open the seals it all goes back into order what denominations couldn't put in place God puts in place because he was there in the original and know the Holy Spirit PES the church into their position to the word listen there comes an Ephesians we're a promised Ephesians it's an age of overcoming that's where we are it's an overcoming age now I'll say this to you tonight amen that how and and I love how brother says this he said then how is it that you can preach predestination like this right yeah and not having atment all right how can I say it's possible for you to be here without paying the fair to get you there and the prophet says it he said how can you preach predestination of God and for ordain and set in order unless there's a sin atonement somewhere there got to be a sin atonement somewh he says now this is right in our subject now which each day you make a mistake and each day you do wrong but if you're born again man or woman soon as you make that mistake God knows you're sorry you can stand in the presence of the rose of ever or anybody else and say I'm wrong God forgive me for this thing and there's the blood atonement watch now notice sins a sinner is a sinner he doesn't commit sins now if you read the book of Ephesians and you'll see there about the 6th and sth verse Paul says we're Redeemed by the blood and we have forgiveness of sins now brother separates it I'll tell you how he separates it he says how can a sinner sin he is sin all right it's like it's like if you were wearing a complete black shirt amen and put a black God on it you can't tell if the whole thing's black put on a white shirt and put a black God on and brother says an unconverted man is a sinner and his whole life is sin but when he's redeemed he said then he becomes a Christian so if some little something happens in his life he said see you're already redeemed of God but then there is a forgiveness of sins oh yeah he said the sinner don't sin he says the believer is the one that has sin now might as well get it out there because if you really believe that if a man ever gets the Holy Ghost he can't never have a sin again in his life then what you does is put the people in a position that they got to get saved every week every mon every year but the prophet never taugh that he taugh that a man was born again and sealed into the kingdom of God that was a finished work and if there was trouble coming to that life that there was the blood told me to bring that man back in life with God it take me two days to prove that but but leave me can't see but there's a Sinners of sin who just doesn't commit sin but the church commits sin does wrong gets wrong thought wrong impression makes SC troubles now watch what man said it's like a little child walking and he's trying to learn how to walk how many y'all trained the child to walk yet amen trying to learn to walk he just don't know how to walk good yet he said cuz he's a little boy but we have a hand that reaches down and steadies us and if he makes this step this way son he doesn't pick us up and spank us because we made a mistake he doesn't beat us to death because we're trying to walk God's not mad at you cuz you're trying to walk come on your desire is to serve God and the devil keeps telling you if you ever made a mistake you can't ever get back up that's a lie out of the pit of Hell Satan is trying to find the church let me get somewhere that's the trouble of the church today you're a scared of making a failure and how can you fall in Christ is in you you can't fall you got everlasting life and all the Demons of hell can't shake you you got everlasting life so don't you be scared of fell now now friends somebody said brother man said the man went to want to get a job and fell said Hey where's your eraser the guy said I don't have no Erasers on my pencils man said the boss said we can't hire you then he said why can't you he said because if you don't have an eraser you ain't doing nothing because a man that don't make mistakes ain't tried nothing and brother Mar says it he said see I rather have mistakes then rather than S do nothing well I tell you what yall didn't do that right you didn't do that right but we were doing something good yes sir but we were doing see when I think of Abraham and all the mistakes he made boy powerful when I think of Abraham and all the mistakes he made and when Abraham's commentary was written the Divine commentary was written Paul wrote Abraham's commentary and he never mentioned one thing about Abraham's unbelief he never mentioned one thing about Abraham's unbelief no never not was never accounted to him Abraham staggered not to the promise of God through unbelief and was strong and giving praise my humble prayers before the grace of God I hope mine wrote like that I hope he writes mine like that that when my commentary is written my obituary he said he never makes the mistakes that I done now I I don't I don't know if you've ever seen this but I think it's a powerful example amen of of the Old Testament and the New Testament how many realize is there just actually one page in between there just one page in between and if you read the book of Genesis and you see Abraham over there amen you'll see all the problems and mistakes that Abraham made amen but then watch on one side of that page Abraham and all his mistakes on the other side of that page there no mistakes and what what what was it that changes you there is a new testament there is the blood of Jesus Christ and the Propet God say he was nothing left of Abraham's mistakes cres over the blood listen this blood has more power than you realize the blood of Jesus has more power than understand oh my goodness the prophet God said see if mine is written like that now now he goes into this private interview I'm closing pretty soon watch this now he goes into this private interview with sister Bru with sister Bruce and when he does he comes up to this place and brother BR speaking to this woman and she's a she's a Believer and she's having some unsettled feelings and she's feeling like maybe she's fa the Lord and brother was talking with her and he does he says now sister I miss to pray for you and I'm not worthy to do that what would I do if Jesus was sitting here now he said if he was sitting here he' lay his hands on you and with his great faith you get well well I think when I'm a sinner he says I'm not himal but I've come to represent him remember me being a sinner and before God I'm not a sin and neither are you we got a blood sacrifice laying there and God don't even see it he hears our voice but he sees the blood of Christ see he sees the blood of his own son it's our voice it's Christ blood then if Christ that talks through us to God therefore we're not Sinners no more we are Christians now brother just told you're sitting in the room and he just told you that oh now this is her this is what she said back to him which represents what many of say I made so many mistakes and I fail so many times yeah and he says that's why Christ died he said so that you with your mistakes wouldn't be lot to you he took your mistakes your desire in your heart is to serve him and she says that's the truth he said that's what he died for so you can serve you your mistakes are not looked at they're not led to you he is your propitiation he he is your sin offering your sins are not know you are not sinner before God Christ took your sins and became you because your desire is to serve him I said but look sister you don't look at yourself it's what you desire and what you try to do and if you really love the Lord you're going to try to serve him with all your heart then your mistakes are he in the blood of the Lord Jesus see he made a way for you and what am I talking about every person in here can live above sin because you can live without sin you make mistakes but the blood of Christ will forgive you get back back to the devil one time and see if you don't feel like serving God again in position a Believer he said life with Christ shut out the world and the Very nature God is in you still subject to mistakes but God can't see it now there's a reason I'm saying these things every time he looks through the blood it looks white in Joshua 1 and verse 5 in the Commandment of Joshua he said therefore shall not any man stand before thee all the days of thy life as I was with Moses so will I be with me brother R says it like this brother sister if you want to be sincere after all my mistakes is showing reason I brought these messages previously was that God shows us that he's merciful Moses made his mistakes a great man like him then when Joshua come up he was going to have to make his too but God said as I was with Moses so will I be God never left Moses and God never left iten Joshua and God will never leave this life I know I know I know what the world's coming to and I know the issues and I know struggles and problems and I've been preaching for a long time now there's been a lot of lot of situations that's come up through these years let me let me just say something to you the prophet in this adoption series is going to tell us something we're on a journey and we crossed this Jordan River and now we're in a battle you know the only thing that can keep you from Victory now is sin when they go up to the Bible of Jericho we'll get to it later when they go to the Bible of Jericho they have a master picture when they leave the Bible of Jericho they go to the Battle of a which is a lesser battle and they lose the battle and the Bible said if they lost their courage for the Bible for the B for the battle and their and their and their courage and their backbones melted like water and they fled from the city and the enemy raced and chased them out and I think they lost up to nearly men I believe in was and when they got there Joshua said wait a minute something is wrong something is wrong there's no way this Army could be losing like this with God on their side so he goes back and begins a prayer meeting and God said they're sin under they're sin among the church now watch this because brother R says it happens to local assemblies right he said when somebody in that church church starts going a certain direction and they get way off the path he said it'll it'll hinder the whole church now you said brother Wayne are you starting into legalism now no I want you to watch something as an as an elder if you're a if you're a sister however you're living is the influence of these young girls that's right listen some of these young girls I know they got off they go now to the theaters and things you know they no don't matter what R said they do what they want to and you're the one wrong if you say something that the funny part about it they ought to be ashamed but they want you to be ashamed because you say it's not to do it other day I was down I was with a pastor in a couple of his daughters and and we were up at a and they were giving away the tickets for a meal or something like that there's a couple of them and the lady walks up to me and she says to me would you like these theater tickets there was some kind of movie tickets you know and I said no I'll give it to these girls they probably W and they come around and both of them were astonished and they look they look back at me said I can't let us go the movie theater I said I'm glad to hear amen but I was glad to hear that from a heart I want you to watch something young people are going to do some things and they're going to try some areas but don't let our elders teach them to do it so what the kids are doing it anyhow well pray will be to God somebody teach them differ you don't join in with it power to it that preach said we should do it well M doing it too that should never now watch this we're talking about we're talking about Believers now that's right I'm talking about salvation now we're talking about your victories we're talking about your walks the the don't have have the power to put you in hell they take all the Victory you got out of your life and it'll take the power of Faith away from you and you'll sit around condemned in your unbelief and when God when God's willing to bless you and give you glories and pow the next thing you know now now watch this Joshua got the pray and found out there was an A and y'all remember what the a was he he buried a wedge of gold and silver the T beneath his T speaking speaking of taking a curs thing now watch as a group of people T don't you just make that about no church now let's pull that down to our personal lives and let's remember when we were on top of the mountain and we were shouting the greatest victories and we were getting victory over this Spirit victory over this Spirit victory over this spirit and all of a sudden we getting so much Victory anymore and that sister said this I'm you Ain no fun and this this person said this you're offended you know he didn't sing my song you're offended you know where all that's happen do you know where all the criticisms coming from somebody said this is wrong that's just kicking they're mad about everything all you know where that's coming from it's coming from something in that [Applause] tent watch now the Holy Ghost started digging in the camp till it found it found the spot and what did they do they took aan and his entire family and they burned him to ashes with his curse with his his it's Joshua it's the Bible Book of Joshua and they took all this and they took it down to this Valley and they spread it out in this Valley and they covered it up with rocks and you know what they did they went back after that was dealt with and they went back up to that same battle they had got ripped in and they were Victorious now that lesson in in there has been used a lot of times in a very negative way don't you allow it to be negative learn a lesson that if you're losing a battle it's not God's fault go back and look at your life and say what is hindering my life from the victories that God has given me and God gave you the victory after the problem there a victory W for every believer that is made to confess their sins I the blood of Jesus [Applause] Christ brother brother Jo you sang that song uh complete with your mother the words of Hosea yall know that's that's that's the story of redemption right how many knows this story you remember and and the problem with it was was Hosea was a prophet and he was he was looking at the Lord and he was and he was saying how do you still love these people and they've done this and they've done that they went into whoredom and they served other gods and how is if you just keep he said I tell you what we'll do you don't marry yourself a heart and have kids by her and then you're going to understand me then you're going to understand why I just can't throw Israel away because she's my wife and she has children and remember the story and then if you're reading the book of Hosea she goes back into her HS after she get married after she she has children she goes back into this place and when she gets out there if you read Hosea the second chapter God through Hosea just starts speaking judgment upon to judgment upon to of judgment then you get to the 14th verse of Hosea chapter 2 and he says but therefore oh and there's a break right in the middle of this Jud oh yeah that's right but therefore I will l Into the Wilderness now watch's the attraction the Bri I will Allure thee I'll draw you out and he said and I'll give you the valley of acor yeah for a door of wh right oh my and here's a woman that's sold herself in the whorm and has a husband and children and she's a long way in the whorm and here's a prophet saying to her I know the trouble you're in but I will give you the valley of a for Hope and what's that y probably like I was first time I read that what in the world's a valley L and how would that be A Door of Hope it's because that was the same Valley that they that was the place where aen had been put and he was telling Homer he was telling hosea's wife that if God could reverse the defeat of the whole Camp of Israel and he gave them a place to hide their sins he gave them appointed place that they can put it and they can lead Victorious then God as a place for you that you can place your sins and you can walk the away and un keep the church Len if God has anointed you and appointed you to be the B of Jesus Christ he has a place for you to give me your sin tonight he has a place for you to say father forgive me I have sinned I need the grace of God in my life there is a place for you tonight say I'm lost and I'm no good for anything amen amen many times that's not true at all many times you've already had a place with God you've already been birthed and you're trying to do the first works over all over again why not let the blood come into your life and change but you know what if our musicians could come but you know what would happen what the enemy will say to you yall know this the enemy don't just want to trap you the enemy wants to keep you he don't just want you to rob the bank he wants to call the law on you get you so whatever whatever goes on in your life Satan don't just want that to be over he wants that to last years right but there is the valley of acor yes sir oh my as a place of hope to every believer sitting here to say that if God did that in the days of Joshua I am a Joshua generation and there is a place where I can put my trusts there is a place that I can put my troubles where they won't come back no more there's a place that I can put my troubles that God said he would never be able to see them again can you imagine that God has a place for you tonight but it would take Faith to believe it would take Faith to believe that the blood can do it now you're sitting here tonight you're saying preacher amen how in the world what how long would something like that take what what would be that way do you all recognize that the prophet of God said when a person begin to say in their heart I'm sorry he said that's when he forgave you brother real real de friend of mine we talked about this one time he had a lady in his church actually that was Inay and she been smok and her testimony was as she's walking in this prayer line she start praying say Lord forgive me I don't want this man to call out my sin this whole place in my I so sorry I should said got in front of prophet AB never said word about later it happened again with another one over in Arizona with Perry green and brother Perry asked why you call said [Applause] see there's a valley of Anor there's a door hole if you standing this tonight I'm sorry I [Music] hope was actually y as a Joshua generation if you're going to go forward to possess see you're not going to me any natural GI all your Giants
