we're living it's a time like no other Lord and we're asking Lord for your mercy tonight Lord on this meeting as we know that every meeting that we have is important every church service Lord I'm aware that it could be our last could be the last time we speak or the last time we hear Lord before morning these old bodies could begin to change and we meet you there and I pray father that God

strengthen them Lord father if they be one lost may you speak to their heart and draw them to your side I pray if the sick be among us Lord that your word would go out and heal them Father now Lord we commit this service to thy faithful hands we pray in the name of Jesus Jesus Christ amen and amen and God bless you if you have your Bibles tonight amen I would like to just speak a a few minutes to you um I want to look from Psalms 139 and I'd like to read verses 14 to verse 17 Psalms 139 Psalms 139 verse1 14 to 17 can you give me a little more in my ear Psalms 139:14 and I will praise thee for I am fearfully and wonderfully made marvelous are thy works that my soul knoweth right well for my substance was not hid from thee when I was made in secret and curiously wrought in the lowest parts of the earth that eyes did see my substance yet being unperfect and in thy book and all thy members were written which in countenance were fashioned when as yet there was none of them how precious also are thy thoughts unto me me oh God how great is the sum of them I want to read in Hosea chapter 6 verse 1 to3 Hosea 6 1:3 this would be a text from recognizing your day and this message this Hosea 6 here come and let us return unto the Lord for he hath torn and he will heal us up he has smitten and he will bind us up and after two days he will revive us and in the third day he will raise us up and we shall live in his sight and brother Braham says we're well into that third day now being that Hosea would have spoke this about 2700 years ago then shall we know if we follow on to know the Lord he's going forth as prepared as the morning and he shall come to us as the rain as the latter and the former rain unto the Earth we ask the Lord to bless his words you could be seated tonight I want to speak to you here for a little while he has come unto us as the rain he has come unto us as the rain amen I uh I read something here out of how I can overcome I'd like to just share this with you now the prophet said I have chose this because I think it's a time that we should never let the spirit of Revival die we've got to keep in Revival constantly revived every day Paul said he had to Die daily that Christ could live and we must never let that Revival die within us amen if you're listening to how I can overcome brother Bram says don't be caught without life in you don't be caught without life in you in the Samar in the church age brother Bram will say excuse me he'll say this he said now here we're coming to a we're coming to a conclusion as the Eternal logos God was manifest in the Sun and in Jesus dwelled all the fullness of the godhead bodily and the Eternal one who was the father manifest In the Flesh and thereby gained the title of son even so we Eternal in his thoughts in our turn became the many membered spoken word seed manifest in the flesh and those Eternal thoughts now manifest In the Flesh are the sons of God even as we are so called we did not become seed by the rebirth we were seed and therefore we were reborn for only the elect can be reborn because we were seed is the reason we could be quickened in the non seed there is nothing to Quicken Now isn't it amazing that a prophet was telling us that we have our turn we have our turn and I think tonight we've got to realize that it is our turn this is the time that God has chosen to place you into the Earth Eternal as a prophet would call it Eternal in the thoughts of God before the foundation of the world but he has chosen this time to place you into this Earth and this is your turn to manifest the the very thoughts of almighty God I know tonight we'd like to see God many people as brother brandham would say he said people would say we'd like to pray him down brother BR said it don't work like that he said God's in you he said so what you want to do is yield yourself and then let God display himself through you and you can see him and your neighbor can see him amen because God is through through his people revealing to his people Amen in this time that we're living in it is a Time amen that it is our turn now the prophet is suggesting that we are Eternal in the thought of God he uses the subject and one place he says the thoughts of God are real and they are Eternal that's pretty powerful the thought of God is real and the thought of God is eternal brother bam says in one place he says if you can see this you will see many things the thought of God is real and is eternal that's why David said my substance was not hid from thee even though I was made in secret curiously wrought in the low parts of the eye Earth Thine Eyes did see my substance yet being imperfect but all thy book all my members were written therein so David is saying the record of me was in the book and the thought of me was in his mind the evidence that we were there in the mind has been placed in the very Bible that you read in this book is placed your members in this place in this book is the record that God had you in his mind even before the world began as yet there was none of them how precious are thy thoughts of me when we think tonight of how that God thought of the church and how that we were a part of that Eternal you know when you when you think tonight and you say well brother Wayne then we're uh uh we're we're Eternal but you see we're not Eternal Sons uh we're not in Turtle sunship let's say it this way because you know the uh the Catholics came up with the idea that there were three gods and one of them was the son the Eternal son and brother bam comes along and he says well there's no such thing as Eternal sunship because sunship means that you had a beginning and you have an ending and he said but God had no beginning and had no ending but the body of Jesus Christ had a beginning and it had a time that was not on the earth so he's showing you amen that it was an eternal God living in his son and so therefore by the same token you and I became Eternal when God came into us it was that Eternal attribute of God so you can look at it tonight and I could look at you and maybe let's say uh how how old are you you're 22 and you've received the Holy Ghost so I could look at you and say you're 22 and eternal amen so there's two different time dates there's a time that you were birthed into the age and then there's a Time amen that was you was in the mind of God now eternity has come into time into this human body so you got two different ages on you if you look at it in uh you look at Michelangelo when he built the Statue of Moses Moses's statue buil out of granite you could look at it and somebody could say well it's 20 years old cuz Michael just built it but you could look at the granite and say it's millions of years old so it's according to what you were looking at were you looking at the granite or you looking at the image that was formed form Med out of amen that's a that's a whole lot to do with some of those Indian AR artifacts you know the rock is a million years old but somebody made it last week you know amen so it's got two different dates on it amen so what we find out then is that God Amen has done the same thing with you as a believer that you are the Eternal Son of God in a human body giving the Eternal God and attribute living in the Earth in our turn Amen in other words that we were made from eternity now just think amen that under these Seven Seals that there's going to come a revelation of what God thought of you from before the foundation of the world so the message of the hour is not just dealing with what we're dealing with today it's giving to you the understanding of God's thought about you from before the foundation of the earth and God sealed it in a book your members were sealed in a book so as Satan couldn't touch this church because it was out of the reach of Satan all the way to the end but see God rich in his Mercy knew that he would send Elijah in the last days to reveal this book back to the church and that we would be able to receive the Eternal thoughts of God that was not corrupted by some man-made tradition or idea see God knew that we were Sons to begin with therefore he sent the spirit of his son Upon Us in the spirit of adoption and is leading us back to the Eternal thought that God had of us from before the world began and listen you can never get there without a prophet of God because a prophet is God's source and channel to restore the church to the former glory she had before the foundation of the world people talk about power but you'll never have true power until you have a restoration of the word and a restoration of the word will bring a restoration of power because it is the Eternal God giving back to the church his some total of what he thought about you from the begin with I think tonight of how precious are thy thoughts of us oh God how precious is the sum of them amen and the message of the hour is bringing a perfect thought concerning your life now in Jeremiah chapter 29 it's a beautiful scripture in the 11th verse for I know the thought that I thought towards you he said sayith the Lord their thoughts of peace and they're not of evil and it's to give you an expected end so you're not not going to surprise God this is an expected end now if you're looking in Jeremiah of course this is dealing with that God's thoughts are not evil but they're peace now the reason being what has happened here brother John is is that the Israel amen has got this beautiful Tabernacle and and they they're living under the laws of Moses and everything is wonderful but they have turned to idolatry and God is telling through Jeremiah that Nebuchadnezzar is going to come and destroy this Temple that is so wonderful and he's going to carry the people all the way back into Babylon and they're going to re remain there for 70 years that's why long they're going to be there and all of them must have thought amen they had all kinds of thoughts about what God was thinking but Jeremiah having the true intent of God is saying that it's not an evil thought of you amen that this is a thought of peace and it is not a thought of evil amen so what we find out is is that God had already planned a restoration before amen they ever even left he's already planning their return and God is going to lead them back under under zerubabel right and zerubabel is going to return and build them again 70 years later it's going to restore the temple and the Bible says and when he begins to do it they look upon it and and brother Matt they said amen the Bible even talks about him weeping and saying that this Temple is not as pretty as the one that was before but the Bible proph prophesies he said for the glory of this latter house is going to even be greater than the glory of this former house amen for the place will I give peace amen saith the Lord isn't it amazing because that former Temple amen and it was a beautiful Temple was built under Solomon and it was the place where the glory of the Lord came in when they sent the word into the Tabernacle the glory of the Lord came in and it was s there oh what a beautiful thing amen what a glory they had and how big it was and beautiful it was but it wasn't to compare with the glory of what the latter Temple was going to receive because what it was going to happen is the glory that had came into Solomon's Temple that was hiding behind the pillar of fire that Majesty that it came was going to return again but it wasn't going to be just the Majesty hiding behind the pillar of fire but that Majesty would return in a human being who would be the Messiah who would be the kinsman redeemer who would be the Lord Of Glory in John the first chapter the Bible says whenever Jesus came to the Earth it says oh my that the word was made flesh and dwelt among us and we beheld his glory as the only begotten amen as the only begotten of the father full of grace and of Truth we beheld Glory like we had never seen glory and that Glory was what entered the temple amen that was restored it wasn't as pretty as the first one but the glory of it was greater than the one that was before amen it was a powerful thing that Christ the son of God was what came into there I I think of the beauty of this amen that God veiled himself in the man and walked in what a glory amen in Jesus's own words he said when you have seen me you have seen the father I think it's beautiful in Malachi when he said the Lord whom you seek shall suddenly come into this Temple amen the Lord you seek shall come into this Temple oh you talk about a glory it was a greater glory than the glory that they had in Solomon it was the glory of God himself coming down into the temple I think today amen of the grace of God that the word became flesh now before it's a word it's a thought so in the beginning was the creation of God in the beginning was the word and the word before it was a word what was it then in the beginning was the word before the beginning now that's a that's that's pretty heavy isn't it but brother random asked the question what was before the beginning before the beginning there was the thought there was the attribute but then when thoughts become expressed then they become words and then words become flesh so it's amazing when you start looking at your thought compared to God's thought in Isaiah chapter 55 the 7th verse the Bible said let the wicked forsake his way and the unrighteous man his thoughts and let him return unto the Lord and he will have mercy upon him and to our God for he will abundantly pardon for my thoughts they are not your thoughts neither are your ways my ways sayith the Lord for his Heavens are higher than the earth that's right so are my ways higher and so my thoughts than your thoughts now God is telling us then that your thought and his thought is two different things but his thought is higher concerning you than your thought is concerning you my ways and my thoughts now brother Ram in the word became flesh in India he does us a beautiful favor talking about this Bible and he said every word in that Bible is God's thoughts laid in seed form and if it's received into the human being and spoke by the same thought that materializes the Bible it will bring the thing to pass what I mean and how powerful ful could this church be the Bible said let this mind that was in Christ be in you as a man thinketh in his heart so is he now your thoughts if they become expression your thoughts become expression Waters of Separation brother B says you've got to die to every thought of this flesh so that you can receive the mind of Christ amen amen and walk not of your own but of his mind the mind of Christ in you that's the only way you can stay alive okay we began by saying we must keep Revival sir we must keep life in us and the prophet is saying the only way I can stay alive is to die from my thoughts and receive the thoughts of God the only way for me to exist in this evil age amen that's flooded with the thoughts of enemy it's flooded with the mind of Satan but if I want to stay alive if I want to survive if if I want to keep my head above the waters I've got to let the mind that was in Christ come into me this Bible says in Thessalonians they which are alive and remain un the coming of the Lord shall not hinder they which are asleep so there's somebody's going to be living so somebody's going to be forsaken their way somebody's going to forsake their mind somebody's going to let it go because that's the only way to stay alive is that you all I live by is the holy spirit see God Leeds on his own word man shall not live somebody say live man shall not live by bread alone but by every word that proceeds out of the mouth of God then your spiritual life will not live on TNT it will not live on Fox News your spiritual life will not live on CBS it won't live on Facebook it won't live on Instagram it won't live on Gossip sessions but when you accept the thought of God in the age of you're living in come on Church what is a prophet he is a channel for the thoughts of God to come into the church if you live on it amen it'll bring life to you that's why brother B says give us Revelation remember everything give us Revelation brother said the most prevailing power in the world is revelation and Revelation I love how he says it he said prevailing and lifegiving wo brother good prevailing and lifegiving Revelation is lifegiving it'll give you life amen God's feeds his his life feeds on the word of God now in IND the trip brother BR says it like this if your heart and your mind is so and filled with God's spirit until your thought becomes his thoughts when your mind and you're leading and you're guiding becomes a direct place or a direct inspiration of the Holy Spirit that's moving in Mortal beings what kind of people should we be amen it's the very Holy Spirit has so embodied or empowered that you don't have your own thoughts you don't use your own mind now there's it's different you know that your thought the Bible says it you have thoughts God has thoughts brother brand is saying if you can get to the place where you don't use your own thoughts anymore brother way see I have this thought about don't use it I think this about it don't use it if you want to live don't use it amen look what he's saying what kind of people could we be this morning if the brandom Tabernacle let's say grace Tabernacle was so filled with the presence of God that we didn't use our own mind we didn't even use our own thoughts didn't even have an alternative oh Hallelujah church can you imagine what kind of people we'll be when we don't have an alternative to the message when we don't have a a second preacher or a third preacher or another another another Authority amen when it's just the word and the word of God Alone we don't have another alternative we don't have another opinion church I know it comes but we don't use it we don't use it and you say preacher how do I keep from using it I love it water of separations you've got to die to every thought of the flesh amen you got to die you got to crucify that thing isn't it something amen self crucifixion is the hardest right you can't follow Christ till you deny yourself you got to deny yourself you got to deny your own thoughts that's the hardest one the opinion is the hardest death there is is when you lose your own opinion you lose your own ideas listen it's the same same walk for every person it's the same distance for every person it's death to self look what he says you can receive the mind of Christ and walk henceforth not of your own but of his mind the mind of Christ in you that's the only way you can stay alive now look at this you ain't got no think coming that brother R was getting pretty you're getting pretty heavy here wasn't he but he was in Jeffersonville I guess he felt Liberty and he said listen you think think question mark you ain't got no think coming he had already quit PR pastoring by now I think brother M he was on the field and he was coming and going he didn't have to deal with this next week you know he said you don't have any think coming can can you imagine this you walk up to your pastor and say well I think we ought to do the and he said you ain't got no think coming well well brother Matt you know you read that scripture the other day and I think you see uh brother brother random I I know you said that about that but I think you see when you when you don't have a think coming when you don't have an alternative to it amen when what the prophet said is what you believe and what he said is exactly right then you have life because it's not your life you're living it's the Eternal thought of God coming into the church see you ain't got no think coming I'm not making this up he really says this he says you he's the one that does your thinking let the mind let you just think the same thing and that's his word now going beyond the camp that's a good one ain't it go beyond the camp so you can get a you can get a group of guys and they all start agreeing to certain things a certain way you ever notice that you you know you you can get a certain set of guys or a certain affiliation the Brotherhood and things and they'll get to feel in a certain way about things or they'll get to think in a certain direction on things and you can't hardly even read a quote that the prophet said that's contrary because it seems so argumentative but but but watch brother random he said but we got to get beyond the camp we get got to get beyond the circles we got to get beyond the Traditions come on and your family may have believed in a certain way or your church might have believed it a certain way that's not we're talking about we're talking about keeping life amen if we're going to keep life we got to get beyond the camp of our reason beyond the camp of our ideas we got to get beyond the camp of these things amen let us go beyond our own thinking amen let us get by listen if I'm not going to use my own opinion I promise I'm not going to use yours if I'm not going to use my own opinion I'm not going to use somebody else's amen I'll just be honest with you if we're going to have an opinion I'll take brother brandom's amen at least he was fellowshipping with an angel on a daily basis I bet his opinions were honed a little bit tighter than uran I was amen we ought to go beyond it amen the Bible said this let the mind that was in Christ be in you so let us think his thoughts not our own thinking because the most of the time we're wrong amen amen so let his mind rest in us and his mind was to do the father's will the father's will is his promised word look at the beauty of this the father's will is this promised word 1 Corinthians 13:10 beautiful scripture when that which is perfect is come then that which is in part shall be done away isn't that beautiful amen some people would use that and say well you know uh uh uh the Bible says that you prophesy in part and you dream in part and you have all these things in part but when the perfect comes apart is done away with now they think well then the gifts are just done away with when the per perfect comes now we know it's talking about the perfect word we know it's talking about the Revelation coming to the age but listen it's not just a ceasing of the gifts God sent a whole age restoring gifts but what's going to happen is there's going to come a word into this age and that word will set the thing so in order that it will remove the failure of the prophecies and the dreams and it will restore the Perfection of the word upon every life come on Church amen y'all know what they did in Pentecost some of these Elders were in Pentecost amen and the funniest one I ever heard they said it happened down here at pal Hatton you know where there was a a woman wanted to marry the preacher you know I think he'd already been married a couple times and somebody got this prophesy and somebody spoke in tongue somebody jumped up and said yay sayith the Lord You're to marry me and we're to go to Mexico and do such certain thing and that old boy he didn't like that prophecy so he just said let's have another saying from the Lord you know because there was no order to it there was nothing to judge that there was nothing to set it in a place so it brought confusion it brought false identifications it brought a place where the devil could do whatever he wanted but when a prophet of God came into this age he set the thing in an order and he did it to bring life to the church he never did it to take out the Holy Ghost he did it to filter out the falsehood and the confusion and he took the devil away the Bible said give no place to the devil come on church amen we're not a bunch of twoy olds with toys and the we've got a perfect word we've got a word that's been restored in the age that we're living in the power of God is returned to this age we're under a prophetic message we're not a bunch of children brother B said it when I was a child I spake as a child brother B said we now have the perfect word he said we don't have to be out in the floor like a bunch of kids trying to speak in tongues come on church that's not where we are we are a Church of the Living God that if the gifts of God want to come they can come I say God let them come but let the spirit of God operate him and not my will and not your will and not your opinion but let God operate the word come on church amen it's going to bring life when I was a child I spake like a child I understood as a child I thought as a child but when I become a man I put away childish things and the politics and the building up and the ideas of man come on but now we see through a glass Darkly now Paul says this and I know in part but then shall I know even as I also am known isn't that beautiful oh you know you know in part Paul said it he said but there's coming a day you're going to know like God knows you you're going to know as you're known that's right amen you're going to know as you're known amen I I I I don't know some time ago I was studying through this and I thought it was so powerful because I got to look at this and I thought isn't it amazing that brother randam says we were that you were a part of God God rich in Mercy it's it's a powerful tape if you never heard it brother B said you were a part of God from before the world began he said the thing is you just don't remember it he said you were there but you just don't remember it right but David said my substance was recorded amen even if I don't remember it it don't mean I wasn't there right just cuz I don't remember it don't mean it didn't happen as a lot of you forgot a lot of things and you were there and it happened and it was real amen but you forgot about it but somebody's got a tape somebody's got a video somebody's got a recording amen and it gives us record and evidence of what was going on during that time greatest greatest thing I've ever seen is my own birth amen when I was born I'm here I know I was born but I don't remember a thing about it but my mom is sitting right back there can tell you the day the hour the time my dad was in the waiting room waiting back in those days men had to wait you know amen they were back there that's been a few days ago amen and and they had to wait and all that but I can tell you I was born on the April 4th I can tell you I was born in pconus Arkansas I can tell you I was born to Joy and Randall Lawson I can tell you all those things but I don't remember one of them but her memory of me has become my memory and now I teach it like it's me because I trust her thoughts I trust her memory come on church this word is God's memory of you and when you get ready to trade your memory and your thoughts you can receive God's thoughts but you can't take one thought here and one thought there either it's all God or it ain't God hallelujah I think God has sent a perfect word God has sent a perfect message in the age I'm living in and yes it is an absolute Authority D Wayne Lawson absolutely it says that I shall be know I shall know as I'm known then the word has become my memory then what I'm looking at is trading a finite mind for an infinite mind I am trading a mind that is limited that is forgetful that is negative I am trading that mind for a mind that thinks peace and it thinks Grace and it thinks power it's an eternal mind it's an infinite mind you said brother Wayne how do you do the swapping it's called the spirit of revelation God has revealed unto us his word when that Revelation begins to come it begins to transform us therefore the Bible said don't let you be conformed as the world but be you transformed by the renewing of your mind come on you could just say well brother Wayne what mind are we talking about Paul PA picked one mind of the entire Bible and said let this mind be in you that was in Christ he never said the one that was in Moses he never said the one that was in David he said the mind that was in Christ could come into the church don't you see the Promise behind that don't you see that if if if the Bible is commanding you to let this happen it's possible to happen it's not just something amen God is telling you let this happen so it's possible to happen it's possible to forget who you are it's possible Amen to forget to get amnesia about this natural life amen and get cured of your Amnesia of your spiritual life Hallelujah I thank God there's a cure there's a cure that we can remember what we ought to remember we can forget what we should forget God who remembers everything also has the ability to forget everything and I want to forget what he forgot and I want to remember what he remembers and he forgot that I was ever assembled and he forgot that I ever had struggles and he forgot the life that I used to live but God remembers the promises that he made to me and the grace that he gave to my life I'm talking about living a life of Eternity on the earth because of the word of God this word is not a byproduct this word is not a second opinion this word means more than life to you Hallelujah amen Paul said we see through a glass Darkly so in in Paul's age it wasn't clear yet now church amen that's that's the Bible right Paul taught it but not with clarity now I'll say very clearly that brother brandom's gospel and Paul's gospel were the same gospel there's not two gospels right he said well we'll get them to Christ and then we'll get them to the message that is a fallacy that is one of the greatest insults to the message of the hour I've ever heard are you telling me you really believe that William brandom's message is separate from the Gospel of Jesus Christ think about that a minute we'll get them to Christ then we'll get them to the message you're suggesting brother bradam has taught something besides what the Bible has taught us amen but really William bram's Ministry has returned us to to the original pattern of the word of God what Paul wrote in a glass Darkly has now become the light of the new day son for the for the Bible tells us that the day star has arisen in our heart and we have seen not just a prophecy we have seen the Fulfillment of Prophecy we've seen the perfect manifestation of the realities of God come on Church well it's not a guess I'm telling you it's not that's right come on this this ain't a guess this ain't brother B guessing around and getting something it was a perfect manifestation of the word now now if you if you notice this it was in a glass Darkly but then it would come he says it again over in 1 Corinthians or 2 Corinthians chapter 3 and then it breaks out in the last verse there and he said We Shall Behold Him and we shall see him and as we look into him we'll be changed amen when you start looking into the into the UN into the unobscured word it'll change you so so David see the seed was laid right it's always amazed me God tells Moses go down and deliver my children I'll be with you go down and deliver them with a mighty hand I'll send Aaron you take this rod and go down and deliver them he didn't tell him nothing about janers and jambers he didn't tell him nothing about the impersonations he didn't tell him about the resistance he would have he didn't tell him about day and Kora but every bit of that was in the original commission and when Paul preached it everything brother randam is teaching down here was in The Original Scriptures it was there that's the basis of it but the thing has come into fruti in the last day and it's Paul's gospel explained by power and manifestation which the Bible said it was the way that God would bring his gospel not by word only but through Power and manifestation if you're a Bible student second Corinthians chapter 4 begins with saying because we have this ministry God has manifestly declared unto you it's powerful and then he begins the next verse and said if our gospel be hid who's our then who's our amen Our Gospel I wonder is that brother randam and Paul if our gospel it's not just we're not just talking about a man who's got idea now y'all help me preach here cu this ain't just a man come up with some ideas folks this is the original thought of almighty God which is your identity as a Believer and without that message you have no identity you have no father you have no mother you're an orphan lost in the world but when God rich in Mercy sent the message of the hour we heard the scream of the eagle and we said Mama that's you and by her we identified ourselves and this message is our identification therefore because you know who it is you're not using your own thoughts you're using his thoughts let the mind that was in Christ be in you amen think his way of thinking he says confession amen means to say the same thing as if you think the same you'll say the same now you got to watch how you dwell on because it comes your words y'all know that's the truth you you ever I'm I'm G preach to the upper room here if you ever have you ever sat down and thought about how you goingon to tell somebody off now I knowbody in here ever done that but you think about all them little things you're troubled by and that you dwell on that a while just keep just keep dwelling there just stay there a while and you know what's going to happen you can hold that for a while but you're going to be in a certain situation you ain't going to have enough sleep you're going to have some pressure on you somebody's going to slam a cabinet door on your hand and that person's going to walk by you and you're G to say everything you've been thinking because you lost the filter to say it so what you do is don't dwell on thoughts that you don't want to speak don't dwell there come into the word of God and when you're dwelling on the word you'll say what you're thinking about amen the Bible said out of the abundance of the heart the mouth will speak what your heart is set on is what your words will come and we cannot alter God's words we have to alter our thinking if we can't change the word we've got to change our thinking come on friends when something's out of the word you don't change the word you change the way you think about it you don't say well I don't know if brother BR meant that or I don't meant if no no no no you don't all Al the word you alter yourself you say Lord let me change my mind about the way I view this about the way I think about this because we want to think like he thinks we want to talk like he talks we want to act like he acts we want the life to be in us let this mind that was in Christ be in you in 1 Corinthians chapter 2 and verse 16 Paul said for who hath known the mind of the Lord that he may instruct him but we have the mind of Christ well I tell you what that shout material there ever was amen we have the mind of Christ do you know what God gave you when he gave you this message he gave you his mind that's what he gave you you know you take a take a honeymoon and young couple ver get married and oh boy he you know everything's just wonderful until he decides he wants things different and then he starts revealing his mind and he says well I'd like it to be like this and I'd like it to be like this now the wife has a chance right then to completely submit to thought or she can say well I don't think that's a good way to do it and then the war's on and what the war is is for headship the headship that's the real war is who is going to do the thinking for this home come on church I'm not talking about your homes I'm talking about church I'm talking about when the Pentecostal world Amen had their mind and they were doing good and and here come the anointed word and when the prophet begin to reveal what God thought about it amen right there was either you submit to the will of God or you fight with the word of God Amen and I don't know about y'all but I said Lord I submit I submit my will I submit my life I submit my Ministry I submit everything to the will of God and only you can do that God won't Force you God won't make you do it that way God won't make you say it that way he'll let you do whatever you want to amen but I say oh God I want to be submissive in my life upon your word that's what I want to do amen I'll tell you this amen it it is something when God begins to show you that this this mystery came to us in this age and as Moses gave the word in his day so has God now the pillar fire appeared to Moses right and he writes the Old Testament the pillar of fire appears to Paul and he writes the New Testament but the same Heavenly messenger that wrote the Bible is here bringing the revelation of the Bible so the only way you have the perfect thought on the scripture is the one that wrote it tells you now to me friends that's the highest order of preaching is when it's the perfect thought of God in Isaiah 55 watch the 10th verse for as the rain cometh down and the snow from the heaven returneth not tther but WTH the Earth and make it bring forth and Bud that it may give seed to the so and bread to the eater so shall my word be that goeth forth out of my mouth it shall not return unto me void but it shall accomplish that what I please and it shall prosper the thing where unto I sent it as the rain comes down amen so is my word came down and it will not return void but it will accomplish what it has been set out to do listen the word that has been spoken cannot return to God without making manifest what it's been promised to do amen let me just say it this way this Bible was spoken but this Bible ain't going back to heaven the the the word the book is the word of God but God's not returning this book to Heaven it's not till this book is fulfilled in the church and takes the Fulfillment of this book to Heaven God ain't coming after a book he's coming after a bride he ain't coming after a book he's coming after the Flesh of the word when the word is made flesh then the bride will return back into the glory listen let me say let me say with all my heart I I don't know a better way to say it but from the book of Genesis when God said amen that that would bring forth a seed a woman's seed should bring forth amen do you know that was that was hundreds of years amen even even until Isaiah picks it up in Isaiah 7 and said a virgin shall conceive that word of the Book of Genesis was added to the Isaiah's prophecies and those the spirit of God was literally circling the earth looking for a virgin but it didn't stop circling in 10 years it didn't fall to the ground in 50 years it didn't fall to the ground in a hundred years but the prophet said 712 years later it came to a little woman out a well and an Heavenly messenger an angel looked at the woman and said thou had found favor with God and thou shall have a son and call his name Jesus and she and she questioned the message she said how can it be me not knowing a man so some questions are good and some questions are bad that was a good question she believed the word she just wanted to know how can I do it and the god of Heaven told her amen thou shallal be overshadowed by the Holy Ghost amen amen thou shall be overshadowed by the Holy Ghost and and what she done was conceived of the Holy Ghost the word of Isaiah was in her Hallelujah the word had hung in her flesh but it wasn't finished right she had to birth that word and as the word become mature Jesus standing there one day looked at them and said I come from God there it was Isaiah said Genesis 3 there it was Isaiah 9 and6 I come from God but Isaiah 9:6 wasn't going back and Malachi wasn't going back and Genesis wasn't going back Jesus was returning to God the word fulfilled was returning to God oh come on church amen this bride is looking for a Rapture just any day and the reason you're going in a Rapture is not just cuz you're good people or you got good personalities it's because the word of the age has Anchored In the Womb of your spirit and it's manifesting his flesh upon this Earth and we come from God we come from God Malachi 4 and Ephesians 5 brother B said everything in the New Testament would be fulfilled in the bride of Christ and now it's going to return back to Heaven Amen in our flesh amen hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah Deuteronomy 32 it is oh it is in the first verse that Moses said give here oh ye heavens and I will speak o Earth the words of thy mouth my Doctrine shall drop as the rain and my speech shall distill as the Dew my Doctrine will come like rain Hallelujah it'll come into the Earth and it'll give seed to the sore and it'll give bread to the eater hallelujah it's the word of God it's the doctrine of the prophet prophets it's the rain of God listen the lighter rain of this church is the message of the hour it's the rapturing faith and has come upon this age we are not looking for lter rain the message of the hour is lighter rain it's God's word reigning upon the Earth rapturing Doctrine rapturing Faith Joel chapter 2 Amen in the 21st verse I love how Joel prophesies it fear not Oh Land we just stop and preach on fear not couldn't we brother don't fear see watch Joel start out his prophecy fear not Oh Land amen I love that don't you when the word just speaks right out to you fear not oh land now watch watch this next verse be glad and rejoice amen now look if there wasn't another scripture read tonight you got permission to Rejoice okay you got permission to be glad glad and to Rejoice because you're not fearing that's the greatest reason to have joy is you have no fear when you have no fear of your destination when you have no fear of what the enemy can do to you when you know that your life is in the hands of God and I've become so much one with the word I'm as Eternal as God is eternal hallelujah amen my life is in God hid in him through Christ listen amen then there's no fear sure we should be glad sure we could Rejoice for the Lord God will do great things for the Lord will do great things can I can I can I help y'all for a moment here it's time to quit expecting judgment it's time to get out of that legal mindset amen if I do he does if I don't he don't amen it's time Church to come back to the doctrine of a prophet get back in the doctrine of the word of God Amen the elect come from God from before the foundation of the world and cannot be deceived come on church if you're the seed of God you're going to go back to God but the power of God the message of the hour has come to claim your soul to return you back to the Eternal thought of God the Lord is going to do great things amen it's not a fearful thing to be in this message we are not looking for judgment I'm not looking for new clear bombs I'm not looking for tribulation I'm looking for great things I'm looking for the power of God I'm looking for Revival I'm looking for the strength of the Holy Ghost to come in the church with healing and power and with anointing I'm expecting great things cuz God said expect great things somebody say out great things great things greater than you can expect greater than you can think the Bible says said let him ask and God can do abundantly exceedingly abundantly above all you can even think or ask brother Wayne on me I've had this issue and I've had this issue quit wearing with it fear not ow Ye Lands expect great things cuz you're the children of prosperity let me tell you you're the daughter of prosperity you're the sons of prosperity somebody said brother Wayne are you preaching a Prosperity Gospel listen Bible said they that believe their prophets shall prosper they shall prosper you know how you'll Prosper cuz you'll quit thinking with that human mind you quit thinking with your ability you get out of your opinions and you'll step into a perfect thought of what God had of you before the foundation of the world you want a Revival get in the message of the hour and watch Revival break over your life and over your home expect great things great things sons of prosperity I I tell you what let me just say this brother bam used that son of prosperity he said everyone of you are yes sir you know how he said it he said all God for knew he's already called and whom he called he's already glorified amen he's already told us the predestinate of God is already glorified and he got so deep into it in the Book of Romans that Paul went on to say that all things amen work together for the good of them that are called of God all things will prosper your way in almighty God look at the Bible if God before us if God before us who can be against us may in all things I am more than a conqueror in Christ Jesus because God rich in Mercy I deserve death but he gave me life I deserved it but God gave us the message anyhow greatest gift of life amen is is when God removes fear gives you a message and says to you expect great things expect a great future expect a great meeting don't come here Sunday thinking well maybe we'll just get through that's nonsense the Book of James be patient therefore Brethren under the coming of the Lord behold the husband man waiteth with precious fruit for have long patience until he receiveth the early and the light of rain you can you can look that word up husband it's the judge he waiteth the judge he waiteth until the judge comes to the door it it that's a that's a direct from Book of Revelations the third chapter right behold I stand the door every other Church age I come quickly I come quickly I come quickly seventh age I stand at the door and knock I come to bring both early and latter rain be patient therefore establish yourself the coming of the Lord draweth nigh in Amos the nth chapter 11th verse and the day will I raise up the Tabernacle of David that is Fallen I'll close the breaches and I will raise up ruins and I will build it as in the days of old and they possess the remen of EV and the Heathen which are called by name sayith the Lord behold the days are coming sayith the Lord that the plowman should overtake the Reaper and The Treader of GRA him that ha sold seed and the mountain shall drop sweet wine and the hills they him out I'll build again the Tabernacle of David y'all know he's talking about the Gentiles right David David went and build a tent over in the city of David and They Carried the word now that first carrying of the word of course killed a man they put it in the threshing floor and then God said to David one day he said go go go heal the breach now go go go preach the breach and bring the word into the tent and then they went and got the word and they brought it down to the tent then that most of your Psalms is written with the word in that tent the Tabernacle of Moses was still set up down there but here the word was in a tabernacle of tents you got the organization and you have tents at the same time now look look what we see when the word is there in those tents in that season he says that the plowman shall overtake the reaper what's that mean that means you got a Reaper and a Ser in the same Fields it's a season of both latter and former rain it's when the both rain see former rain is a planting rain and harvest rain is a harvesting rain and they're prophesying a season under the Tabernacles of David when the season will be so powerful that the planning and the harvesting will happen at the same season can you imagine God working so quick think about this that a prophet could say let there be a squirrel and the planter and the reaper were in the same field Isaiah said it a virgin shall conceive and it was 712 years before the former the lighter rain struck the former rain but in the season of the days of the Tabernacle of David when the t is set up among the Bride come on Church it'll be a season the former latter of rain come together it'll be when a prophet says there'll be a bride and it won't be another season but in our turn to express the Eternal qualities of God yes it'll be in a season it'll be in a season like this when a woman sitting there saying Amen to the word of God will get her children given to her by the angel of the Lord how do you can have them amen and what did we see we've seen a former rain and we've seen a harvest rain in the same season in the same house listen some of you have come to church and you know you come in sick and while the preacher was preaching while the preacher was preaching he said something and it struck your soul and there was a seed song and there was a seed harvested in the same season listen church we are living in the greatest season that has ever been given to mankind I know I know I was preaching one night and a woman I I actually announced from the Bible there was seven stars and and it was amazing because brother bam brother bam was talking about the Seven stars of The Book of Revelation he said there's the seven angels seven churches but when the Thunders come we remove the symbol of the Book of Revelations and then we'll be able to see it for what it is and I said that first star was Paul but that seventh star was a man named William brandom it was a woman sitting there in that meeting that had leukemia for a while amen it took her a year later a year later I saw that lady in Norway Camp she come up to me and she said brother Wayne last year when you were preaching on the Seven Stars of God she said you announced the Seven Star as the man William brandom she said there was an anointing that struck my body she said I felt a heat from the top of my head to the bottom of my feet and God instantly healed me of that leukemia brother Wayne listen it was a season of a seed swn and a seed reaped in the same season listen we're not talking about something that maybe it could happen next week or happen next day but you can walk into this building tonight with depression in your heart and under the preaching the word of God let depression leave you and right here in the building tonight not in future but right here in this building tonight change can come to your soul amen listen the Holy Ghost can come and fill your heart life can come to you brother B said it'll come a season Mark he said that limbs will be added on to people while they're setting in the seats you know why he said that cuz leukemia was healed in the back room he said God had changed the blood cell to do it he said if God could change a blood cell he can add a blood cell and he said he can add members to a body listen and I know tonight maybe we don't have somebody needs a member at it but you know what we need we need a hand of faith we need a hand of faith we can have the greatest message on the earth and brother Brandon was told by the angel this message this third pull is the sword of God in the hand of a prophet well listen this word this message that God gave us is your sword to fight through the darkness of this age God gave you a message he gave you a perfect word don't you let no devil take that out of your hand don't you let no devil give you an alternative or give you another idea you hold on to that sword and you fight with all you got in you this is a season Church you said brother way I don't have enough Faith to hold the word I pray God create a I pray God create a hand of faith in this building tonight a hand that can hold the word the enemy said well you're going to be destroyed I say God give us a hand that can hold the word expect great things in the opposition expect great things God's going to do great things all things work together for the good of them that love God God ain't on nerve pills tonight God ain't seeing a psychologist tonight God ain't worried about what's going to happen why are you worried about it why don't you just let go and go back to God with all your heart and say Lord Carry Me Away on the wings of an Angel let me fly into the hearts of the adoption of the word in the age and I'm living in expect great things stand to your feet with us tonight expect great things it's the season he has come Toto us as rain he said he was coming as rain sir wasn't it Elijah at the end of judgment he looked over at him and he said I hear the sound yes sir I hear the sound of the abundance of rain been three and a half years years since it had been there sir expect rain to come Elijah said it but you remember what happened when the prophet said it he he was so tired he went up on the mountain sat down put his head between his legs and told a servant to go look for it he said go look see what you see and the man come back and said I don't see nothing I mean brother baram I don't mean to doubt your prophecy but I don't see how grizzly bear I mean I don't mean to doubt but I just don't see how this thing's going to happen I don't see nothing go look again just look again that boy had to return seven times to see what a prophet had already seen in the vision the prophet had already seen the cloud he'd already seen the rain he already knew what was going to happen before he ever spoke it he spoke it by Vision but keep looking till you see what a prophet said about it and then you don't care if you see something you don't care what nobody else sees you I'm talking about the wings of an eagle I'm talking about getting out of the atmospheres of doubt and unbelief and negative and mindsets of humanity climb up there where sons of God announce the word of God with Outsider feeling he come running back he said oh I finally do see the cloud the size of a man's hand

have need of that's what Paul said he said we've been made more than conquerors through him that loved us he gave his life for us and he made the way Brother David that we could be conquerors it doesn't matter I I love that cuz Paul said it in the Ephesian Church age but he didn't limit it to the Ephesian Church age so it didn't matter what age that you came in he said we've been made more than conquerors through him that loved us and I believe that we're conquerors in this age amen you love the Lord amen I just think that was powerful my brother Wayne got to talk about that Amnesia and just a a few days ago me and me and Sarah we were cleaning out the old shop and you know how you get them old boxes and stuff that you stored up that that you should have threw away years ago think if you if you hadn't looked at it in 10 years it's not you don't really need it and but we were going through that stuff and trying to clean it out and we found some old videotapes so we went in the house and started playing some of them videos and would you believe there on this video there there's this young man on there and and his hair is all messed up goofy looking guy and big ears and my and and acting I mean just a goofball you know and we're watching that and I said what in the world is who is this guy and she that is you I mean that that that is you and you it was such a we were sitting there talking about that the other day isn't it weird that you can watch a video of yourself and don't even remember doing it I don't remember the room we were in I don't remember the the the the place we were wherever we were staying I don't have a single memory of it and I watch a video and trying to convince myself watching a video of me that it was even really me and I thought my if that's that way just in a few years isn't it something that God would if that if that can happen to your human mind in a few years don't you see how that it could happen that you were that you were somebody else and you didn't even know who you were but brother Cody that God would come in this age and he'd say you was a Son of God before the foundation of the world you in the very Mind Of God you don't you didn't even know who you were when you was born in this life you was RA you went through many years years of your life and all a sudden you heard these words you were a daughter of God you were with me whenever before I ever formed you I thought of you I knew I knew how you would be when you was even in your mother's womb that's how we were with God and that God would come and tell us in this age isn't it wonderful what a what a what and you you could sit and argue with God no that wasn't me I know my life I know what I've been through and I know who I was but he said no but you were with me I just think it's wonderful tonight that God could come and remind us in the very life of Christ can live on the inside of a human being and you can you can manifest a different life than you've always been isn't it wonderful you love the Lord tonight amen we just can we sing that song Greater is he that is in me amen you love the Lord won't you give him another hand clap of praise
