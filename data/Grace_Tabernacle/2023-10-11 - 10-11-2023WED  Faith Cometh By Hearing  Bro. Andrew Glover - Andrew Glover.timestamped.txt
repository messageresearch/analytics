[35:58] that that Faith brings Christ he said
[36:00] now could you remember 80y old Simeon
[36:03] with a white beard white hair that the
[36:05] old man went around telling people he
[36:08] wasn't until he seen the Lord's Christ

[36:14] faith on the first night of this meeting
[36:16] amen Faith knows no defeat amen can we
[36:19] say that Faith know no defeat can I say
[36:23] faith is perfect amen Faith brings
[36:26] things when there's no things to be
[36:28] brought amen Faith creates amen Faith
[36:31] takes away doubt it takes the negative
[36:33] and makes it positive amen faith is
[36:36] positive faith is a Creator faith is not
[36:39] negative faith is positive and if faith
[36:42] comes in the church it'll take the
[36:44] negative and turn it into the positive
[36:46] it'll take the sick and turn them into
[36:47] heal it'll take the bound and turn them
[36:49] into free amen and Faith cth by hearing
[36:53] and hearing by the word of God how
[36:55] beautiful that old man 80 years old
[36:57] Simon had a basis for Faith and his
[37:00] faith was not mythical it was not
[37:02] something mentally worked up it happens
[37:04] in a person's heart when faith is
[37:07] a something in the person's heart or
[37:12] it's not to have a
[37:15] foundation Faith Foundation amen faith
[37:18] has no hindrances are you with me
[37:20] tonight faith is positive Faith knows no
[37:23] defeat Faith calls things in are as
[37:25] though they're not and Fa are not as
[37:27] though they are faith has no hindrances
[37:30] look said men of all ages that has Faith
[37:33] what they're trying to achieve has been
[37:34] persistent he said and you have to be
[37:37] persistent you cannot just sit back and
[37:39] say well I'll see what John do does
[37:41] about
[37:42] it you cannot do that before you can be
[37:46] persistent you've got to have faith in
[37:48] what
[37:52] you're will not
[37:55] persist
[37:57] then first is to have faith now and then
[37:59] you've got to know what source you're
[38:01] drawing your faith fromen where is your
[38:04] faith coming from where is your faith
[38:06] coming from the prophet of God says amen
[38:09] what you're wanting has got to be in
[38:11] amen what you're drawing from like if
[38:13] you're wanting wateren you cannot go to
[38:15] a desert and a cactus and draw water out
[38:17] of a cactus there's no water in the
[38:20] cactus to come out and to satisfy the
[38:23] desire you're thirsting for amen but if
[38:25] you want water you go to a whale oh God
[38:28] can we preach if you want water you go

[38:56] and going from this problem and going
[38:58] from this problem you got to turn your
[39:00] eyes away and Look Away to Jesus am and

[39:13] questionin but there is faith in this
[39:16] message and if you turn your attention
[39:18] from the things of the world to the
[39:20] things of God and start calling you'll
[39:22] pull an answer you'll pull a miracle
[39:25] you'll pull a healing because faith is
[39:27] in the
[39:29] [Applause]
[39:31] word to be God in here first to make
[39:35] Faith now I'm going to say it it has to
[39:38] be God in here first to make Faith amen
[39:42] John 1:1 says in the beginning and the
[39:44] Word was with God and the Word was God
[39:47] and in the 14th verse the word was made
[39:49] flesh and dwelt Among Us now let me ask
[39:52] you this then where was God he was in
[39:55] the word and where was the word it was
[39:58] in God because God is the word then when
[40:01] the word was made

[40:30] let every man be swift to hear and slow
[40:31] to
[40:33] speak you know it's not popular when it
[40:36] didn't be not become popular to quote a
[40:39] prophet when it didn't become when it
[40:41] become not popular to do it then in the
[40:43] days of the voice of the Seth Angel when
[40:46] he shall begin to sound listen his voice
[40:49] is proceeding something what is his
[40:52] voice proceeding brother Jeff his voice
[40:54] is proceeding the word and the word is
[40:57] the source of Faith Prophet says he said
[41:01] the church today ought to be pressing
[41:03] everywhere and to hear the word of God
[41:07] why are you all here tonight you had to
[41:09] press through some things come on Church
[41:11] you had to press through some things but
[41:13] you're here to hear the word see now
[41:16] watch what the spirit of Prophecy spoke
[41:18] about the age we're living in though the
[41:20] spirit of Prophecy said in Amos 8 And1
[41:23] said behold the days cometh say the Lord
[41:25] God that I will send famine in the land
[41:27] it's not a famine of bread nor a thirst
[41:30] for water amen but of hearing the words
[41:33] of the Lord said he said there will come
[41:35] a famine in the land not for bread and
[41:37] water amen but for hearing of the word
[41:40] of God now watch this the true word of
[41:42] God now do you realize there's not a
[41:45] famine for the word it did not say
[41:47] brother Caleb there would be a famine
[41:49] for the word it said there would be a
[41:51] famine for the hearing of a word you
[41:53] know why because we've got plenty of
[41:55] word
[41:57] we've got the seals revealed we've got
[41:59] the church ages revealed we have had the
[42:01] mind of God brought into this age by a
[42:04] prophet of God listen there's plenty of
[42:06] word but there is a famine for the
[42:08] hearing of the word he said if they
[42:11] don't fit this nation this time I don't
[42:12] know where it does fit we don't need
[42:14] bread we got plenty of it we don't need
[42:16] clothes we got plenty of them nice homes
[42:18] everything amen but there's a famine for
[42:20] the hearing of the word of God a man
[42:23] won't know what to believe that's right
[42:25] he said all confus one says this one
[42:27] says that one says this one says
[42:29] something else amen but base your
[42:31] thoughts Amen on thus sayith the Lord
[42:34] and God will confirm it base your
[42:37] thoughts on thus sayith the Lord and God
[42:40] will confirm it in other words what thus
[42:43] sayith the Lord be the foundation for
[42:45] your faith and the only way we have thus
[42:47] sayith the Lord is God has sent a
[42:50] prophet who has said th what the Lord
[42:52] had on his heart to say listen friends
[42:55] this message is not sayth the Lord to
[42:58] this generation it's say the Lord to the
[43:00] marriages it's not the Lord to the young
[43:03] people it's th come on church this
[43:06] message is thus sayth the Lord so put
[43:09] your faith on thus sayth the Lord and
[43:12] follow in the direction of the S the
[43:14] Lord he said we've lived to see the day
[43:17] when one says this way and one says that
[43:19] way but we're thankful Lord that you
[43:21] said I am the
[43:22] way I like that man we live to see one
[43:26] said go this way and one said go that
[43:28] way but we had a Prophet come in this
[43:30] generation who picked up the Bible and
[43:33] said don't go that way brother M don't
[43:35] go this way amen go this way I am the
[43:38] way and if you are the way then your
[43:41] present here now amen to prove that you
[43:43] are the
[43:45] way if Jesus said I am the
[43:48] what the truth and the M then if he said
[43:52] follow me I am the way that he's here
[43:55] present now
[43:56] to confirm he is the way listen friends
[43:59] the only way we know the way is we
[44:01] received a prophet say the Lord and when
[44:05] he begin to sound there was a word he
[44:07] was sounding I love the Bible because in
[44:09] Daniel 9 I hope this is okay in Daniel 9
[44:12] the Bible says amen that I Daniel
[44:14] understood by books can I say that we
[44:16] today understand by
[44:19] books I Daniel understood by books we
[44:22] today understand by books and the
[44:24] prophet said I understand in the last
[44:26] days will come a famine that the
[44:28] churches will be so organized and so set
[44:30] and everything that in the last days
[44:32] will come a famine and it'll not be for
[44:34] the bread of water but for the hearing
[44:36] of the word of the Lord he said I also
[44:38] understand that he'll send Elijah before
[44:40] that day comes at he end of time and
[44:42] he'll have a message that'll turn the
[44:45] heart he'll have a message that will
[44:48] turn the
[44:49] heart he didn't say brother The Joy
[44:51] would turn the
[44:53] head he said he would turn the heart
[44:56] of the children back to the fathers back
[44:59] to the original go back to the end and
[45:01] start now I understand that'll take
[45:03] place just before amen the spirit leaves
[45:06] the Gentile Church to return to the Jews
[45:10] just before that happens Elijah's
[45:12] message will come into the church by the
[45:15] sounding of the voice of the seventh
[45:17] angel and it will be a faith washing in
[45:20] the church this message will wash your
[45:23] faith come on church this message
[45:26] will wash your faith it'll wash it down
[45:29] from all the denominational influence
[45:31] it'll wash it down from all the
[45:33] emotional and worly and indiffer
[45:35] influence it'll wash your faith down to
[45:38] where the Bible said it'll be a
[45:39] Sanctified Faith it'll be cleansed with
[45:42] the washing of the Water by the word you
[45:45] know what the water of separation is the
[45:47] Waters of separation is the word and
[45:50] Faith cometh by hearing amen by hearing
[45:52] of the word that how you going to get
[45:54] Faith unless you hear the word and how
[45:56] you going to be washed unless you hear
[45:58] the word I might as well preach it's
[46:00] time I might as well bust it open and
[46:02] how are you going to hear unless you
[46:04] show up to
[46:07] hear amen come on you got to show up to
[46:11] be washed you got to show up to hear the
[46:14] word somebody shout hallelujah the word
[46:18] got to be preached and if the word
[46:20] cannot be preached unless somebody sent
[46:22] to preach it and the word cannot be
[46:24] received unless God put somebody in the
[46:27] to receive the word he said to be listen
[46:30] I want to say this God's word will not
[46:33] return unto him vo will accomplish what
[46:36] it is set to do let say this my God's
[46:39] word will not return to him and the
[46:41] angel that brought the word have to give
[46:43] a reason for why you didn't receive it
[46:45] if it's your not to receive the word of
[46:48] godil Hell the spirits the bad days good
[46:52] days up days down days in days out days
[46:55] stop you from receiving the forun word
[46:59] that has come to set you free the word
[47:02] of God the Waters of Separation amen
[47:04] through the water through the wash of
[47:06] the Water by the word you come and hear
[47:08] the word are you ready for this you come
[47:11] and hear the word and the first thing it
[47:13] does is it separates you to move your
[47:16] thoughts from the evil to the good W
[47:20] Glory the first thing the word does is
[47:23] it separates you and it moves your
[47:25] thoughts from the evil to the good are
[47:29] you hearing me when you hear the word
[47:31] the word moves your thoughts from the
[47:34] evil to the good now listen to The
[47:36] Prophet every person he's speaking of a
[47:38] Sanctified life every person amen lives
[47:41] in a three room house he said no matter
[47:43] how many rooms you may have he said you
[47:45] still live in a three room house he said
[47:48] God lived in a three room house back in
[47:50] his Tabernacle which was the
[47:51] congregation the courts of the
[47:53] congregation amen the holy place and the
[47:55] holy h of holies he said now listen he
[47:57] said just like the steps come to Amen to
[48:00] the place of a full consecration with
[48:02] Christ now watch this the kitchen is
[48:04] where you eat so the sinner comes to the
[48:07] meeting and he feasts on the word
[48:09] because Faith cometh by hearing and
[48:12] hearing of the word he comes to hear the
[48:14] word and many times now I may get tired
[48:17] here but let me preach many times we
[48:19] substitute so much amen instead of the
[48:22] word especially today he said we're
[48:24] substituting the pH
[48:26] we're sub a lot of other things that
[48:28] shouldn't be can I say what the prophet
[48:30] said he said after all church is for the
[48:32] preaching of the
[48:35] word come on church church is for the
[48:38] preaching of the word this is a t
[48:41] meeting it's church and it's for the
[48:43] preaching of how say Lord preach the
[48:46] word to me this weekend no matter what
[48:48] vessel stands there just let me hear the
[48:51] word that'll separate me from the
[48:53] negative and bring me to the positive
[48:55] it'll separate me from the evil and'll
[48:57] move me to The Good the church is for
[49:01] the preaching of the word testimonies
[49:03] refine different things we do is
[49:05] wonderful but we must give the word
[49:07] first place because it's for The Sinner
[49:10] and for the people that has the Holy
[49:12] Spirit
[49:14] also I know some yall said praise God
[49:17] the but don't stop there read all the CL
[49:20] it's for you this the Holy Ghost also
[49:23] because Jesus when he was tempted said
[49:25] is written amen that man shall not live
[49:27] by bread alone but by every word that
[49:30] proceedeth out of the mouth of God see
[49:32] the Holy Spirit feeds on the word of
[49:36] God he takes the word and places it into
[49:39] your heart and makes you grow in
[49:41] strength and do good Bible exploits amen
[49:45] so you see the argument that just
[49:46] doesn't stand we're not to argue we are
[49:49] to preach the word and God will have
[49:51] somebody God will have somebody that
[49:53] will hear it and receive it those who
[49:55] Jesus die to hear the word they'll hear
[49:58] it those who Jesus die to hear the word
[50:01] they're going to hear it you know why
[50:03] they're going to hear it because
[50:06] faith faith cometh by hearing now watch
[50:10] what this Prophet says he said you
[50:12] remember in Hebrews 11:1 we're POS it
[50:13] let's read it amen faith is the
[50:15] substance of what things hope for it's
[50:18] the evidence of Things Not Seen amen for
[50:21] by it amen the elders obtained a good
[50:23] report and through faith we understand
[50:26] that the worlds were framed by the word
[50:28] of God so that the things which were
[50:30] seen were not made of things which to
[50:33] appear Hebrews 11 the Bible says amen by
[50:36] faith God spoke the world into existence
[50:39] because it was a premeditated word but
[50:41] as soon as he said it it become life the
[50:44] word you're sitting on tonight is the
[50:46] Earth but it was a premeditated word and
[50:49] brother joob the minute it crossed the
[50:51] lips of spirit of God and spoke amen it
[50:54] become life he said now you say I
[50:56] believe that brother random in your
[50:57] heart you can believe it then express it
[50:59] I believe it don't never change it stay
[51:01] right with it watch what will grow out
[51:04] of it it'll produce the word CA it's
[51:06] faith and wisdom takes you away from
[51:10] it but Faith brings you to it see then
[51:14] what is faith is God by I know I'm
[51:16] reading lot but I'm doing this on
[51:17] purpose is God revealing the spirit
[51:20] revealing to you something that he's
[51:22] going to do or he's promised to do now
[51:24] if you only hear Faith cometh by hearing
[51:27] amen but hearing is not Faith a loaf of
[51:29] bread is purchased for 25 cents but 25
[51:32] cents is not a loaf of bread see hearing
[51:34] only brings the word that produces Faith
[51:37] amen but faith is the substance of
[51:39] things hop for it's the evidence of it's
[51:41] not seen and you see you hear the word
[51:44] and God reveals it to you and confirms
[51:47] that it's the truth and by Spirit
[51:49] revealed truth confirms your faith to
[51:52] God listen Church the message of the
[51:54] hour amen is the spirit speaking truth
[51:57] to you which is Vindicated truth to fall
[52:00] into your life and manifest what God
[52:02] said he would do for you now I'm just
[52:05] going to say what a prophet said he said
[52:07] the church in differences has the same
[52:09] old Roman insect that started in I seea
[52:11] he said the korm eat it down and the
[52:13] Locust eat it down and the pom MaDee it
[52:16] down and the caterpillar ate it down
[52:18] amen but God said I will
[52:22] restore I will restore unto you all the
[52:25] years that the gorm and the Ponder worm
[52:28] ate away I love what the prophet says
[52:31] infallible word of God as the sun rose
[52:34] up Amen to show Superstition all the
[52:37] years of the caterpillars destroyed we
[52:39] pray father that you'll send and the
[52:42] resurrection power of Christ that you
[52:44] might restore and resurrect us somebody

[53:06] opening scripture Romans 10 Paul there
[53:09] is speaking to the Romans which had been
[53:11] heathens which were idolators and they
[53:13] had just come over into Christianity and
[53:16] when Paul writes this he's speaking to
[53:18] them about faith you know in the fourth
[53:20] chapter of Romans he speaks to about
[53:22] Abraham being justified how many
[53:24] believes Abraham
[53:25] was justified by faith in Romans the 9th
[53:28] chapter he's speaking on the election of
[53:30] God how that God called Esau Jacob and
[53:33] ordained Jacob see there is called
[53:35] election by faith but in the 10th
[53:37] chapter somebody say the 10th chapter
[53:39] 10th chapter we find him now dividing
[53:42] what faith is now Faith is Burly my how
[53:45] I like to think of Faith he said watch
[53:48] hope what a beautiful thing hope is
[53:50] little timid hope lovely and sweet as
[53:51] she is yet she's the greatest enemy that
[53:54] faith has the greatest enemy that face
[53:57] God is Hope because a person becomes so
[54:00] hopeful till they get away from Faith
[54:03] see but hope will agree with the Bible
[54:05] hope will say it's true hope will say I
[54:07] believe every bit of it amen but hope
[54:09] says it's in the future amen but faith
[54:12] is
[54:15] Burly faith is Burly he said as I once
[54:18] said faith has hair on the chest and
[54:20] when it stands up and pulls its muscles
[54:22] out everything else vanishes amen if you
[54:25] just rely on hope you will hinder Faith
[54:28] now hope looks for something way off
[54:31] amen but Faith claims it hope something
[54:35] off amen but Faith claims it right now
[54:39] come on Church the Revival is not in the
[54:41] future it's right now the meeting come
[54:44] on the meeting is not in the future it's
[54:46] happening right
[54:49] now come on know what the devil does the
[54:51] devil willo you with hope and Sunday
[54:53] morning at about 1:00 when everybody's
[54:55] leaving you'll still be looking for
[54:57] something to happen but if you can let
[55:01] Faith leave me alone I'm going preach if
[55:03] you can let Faith open up your eyes you
[55:06] will see that it's not H going to happen
[55:08] it's happening right
[55:10] now hope is put in the future but faith
[55:14] is brought at presense When Faith speaks
[55:16] everything
[55:19] else when Faith speaks everything else
[55:22] shuts up he said now that's the problem
[55:24] there's to intellectual Faith instead of
[55:27] being heart faith and do you all know
[55:29] that brother man preaches a sermon
[55:31] called believe from the
[55:33] heart he does not call it believe from
[55:36] the head in Proverbs 23:7 the Bible says
[55:39] as he thanth in his heart so is he in
[55:41] Psalms
[55:42] 119:1 Thy word have I hid in my heart
[55:46] that I might not sin against thee in
[55:48] Romans 10:10 for with a heart amen man
[55:51] believeth under righteousness and with a
[55:53] mouth confession is made unto salvation
[55:56] listen brother says if a man or woman
[55:59] could ever get their faults somebody say
[56:00] their faults their testimony testimony
[56:04] and their lives if you could get your
[56:06] thoughts your testimony and your life so
[56:08] lined up with God until the channel of
[56:11] the Holy Spirit would be perfectly one
[56:13] with God what would take place if the
[56:15] man and the woman could ever get lined
[56:17] up where with predom from their hearts
[56:20] with Faith from the innermost now many
[56:22] people come to the altar to be prayed
[56:23] for they have intellect ual Faith they
[56:25] confess their sins and they join a
[56:27] church by intellectual Faith they
[56:29] believe it in their mind they believe it
[56:30] because they heard it they believe it
[56:32] because they know it's the best policy
[56:34] but that's not what God looks at he said
[56:36] he doesn't look at your intellectual
[56:38] Faith he looks on the heart on the
[56:40] inside where God is he said when it
[56:43] comes from the heart of all things are
[56:45] possible then your confession meets up
[56:47] with your life and your life speaks as
[56:49] loud as your confession does and when
[56:51] your confession says one thing and your
[56:53] life says another there's something
[56:55] wrong somewhere because you got an
[56:57] intellectual faith and not a Faith from
[57:00] your heart and that shows it outside
[57:02] here is a knowledge of God I'm preaching
[57:04] to you right now outside here there's a
[57:06] knowledge of God but inside here is a
[57:09] demon of
[57:10] doubting somebody outside there is a
[57:13] knowledge of God but on the inside there
[57:16] is a demon about it I believe in Divine
[57:18] Healing but it's not for me you see it
[57:20] could be so but I don't believe it amen
[57:22] do you get it outside you say yes but
[57:25] inside your conscience says no listen
[57:28] church I'm going to preach I'm going to
[57:29] bust we got too many people sitting
[57:31] around on the outside they're saying yes
[57:34] on the outside they're quoting all the
[57:35] quotes on the inside they're saying I
[57:37] don't know I'm to this I'm to that amen
[57:40] but why don't you let this be a meeting
[57:42] when the outside moves on the inside and
[57:45] the inside say and the outside say and
[57:49] the CH and the preacher CH and your CH
[57:53] and your ch
[58:01] just yes but know on the inside but get
[58:05] of the
[58:08] [Applause]
[58:09] know brother and I don't know what Jesus
[58:12] said if you ask anything in my name
[58:15] that's
[58:16] right whoever shall stand to this
[58:18] mountain be thou removed and be thou not
[58:22] cast be thou cast in the sea and sh not
[58:25] doubt in
[58:26] your
[58:27] heart in your heart break it now but
[58:31] Shall
[58:32] Believe those things which he saith
[58:36] shall come to pass he shall have
[58:39] whatsoever he
[58:41] sayth say this we cannot mix the
[58:44] intellectual with the
[58:46] supernatural they have no dealings with
[58:48] each other the intellectual says no the
[58:51] supernatural says yes see now now you
[58:54] remember the prophet says intellectuals
[58:56] will say one thing I hope this is okay
[58:58] and the supernatural will say another
[59:00] and any man that's ever led by this
[59:03] spirit of God does not take any thought
[59:05] of the intellectual but he's LED from
[59:07] his heart by the spirit of God a
[59:10] supernatural man is led by his heart by
[59:14] Faith from the word in a supernatural
[59:17] way y'all remember the Bible talks about
[59:19] Hannah the Bible says that Hannah was
[59:21] bearing a reproach cuz she was Desiring
[59:24] a child
[59:25] the Bible says that Hannah went down to
[59:26] the temple remember that she went down
[59:28] to the temple and when she walked in she
[59:31] was screaming and hollering and the
[59:33] priest come out brother Joe and thought
[59:34] she was drunk and the priest said how
[59:36] long will you be on strong drink you
[59:39] know what she said he said that's way a
[59:41] lot of people are today they get sincere
[59:43] they're just misunderstood she wasn't
[59:45] drunk she was misunderstood and many men
[59:48] and women who are really from their core
[59:49] of their hearts really fully surrendered
[59:52] to the Lord Jesus Christ they're not
[59:54] crazy brother Jared they're
[59:56] misunderstood because the world knows
[59:58] their own and God knows his
[1:00:02] own come on the world knows their own
[1:00:05] brother Wesley and God knows his own and
[1:00:08] watch the Lord give you the desire of
[1:00:10] your heart he said now God could have
[1:00:11] put that baby in her arms if he wanted
[1:00:13] to even knew that he was has a way of
[1:00:15] doing things it don't make any
[1:00:17] difference whether it happened right
[1:00:18] there or not she had God's word sunk in
[1:00:21] her heart brother then the word of God
[1:00:24] was sh in Hannah's heart and that word
[1:00:27] was strong oh my that word was strong
[1:00:29] enough Amen to get her through every El
[1:00:32] of criticism that word was T sister Eve
[1:00:35] that word carried her to the church and
[1:00:37] it carried her back
[1:00:39] home come on Church the pro said as she
[1:00:41] walked down there he said what happened
[1:00:44] he said there was all kinds of critics
[1:00:45] criticizing her where you going that old
[1:00:47] meeting yeah that's where I'm going way
[1:00:49] you going to get just a bunch of emotion
[1:00:51] or a bunch of work amen but she had a
[1:00:53] promise and she walked in that Temple by
[1:00:56] that promise and she got in the house of
[1:00:58] God by that promise and she made her way
[1:01:00] to the altar by that
[1:01:03] promise the priest come out and try to
[1:01:05] rebuke her for being drunk but a
[1:01:07] promised Helder the preacher rebuked her
[1:01:10] but a promis held her and Eli announced
[1:01:13] the blessing upon her with a promis held
[1:01:15] her listen Church she could have got the
[1:01:16] baby right then and carried it back home
[1:01:19] and that would have removed all the
[1:01:20] criticism all the gangs Sayers that was
[1:01:22] making fun of her on her way down the
[1:01:24] tent meeting would have been asking her
[1:01:26] what happened on the way home but rather
[1:01:28] than let her go home with a baby God
[1:01:30] made her walk back to the same critics
[1:01:32] but she still held the
[1:01:35] promise Church Living God some of y'all
[1:01:38] had to walk through all kinds of
[1:01:40] negativity and critics and devils and
[1:01:42] this and that to get in this meeting
[1:01:44] amen but I want to assure you God has
[1:01:47] got word of a word upon word upon word
[1:01:50] upon word for you this weekend and that
[1:01:52] word rece in your heart it'll move from
[1:01:55] the intell it'll move from the ideas
[1:01:57] it'll break over to the Supernatural and
[1:01:59] the same word that you carry here or
[1:02:02] carry you out of this
[1:02:04] world are you hearing me church I'm
[1:02:07] talking about supernatural
[1:02:09] [Applause]
[1:02:12] things God said Sarah Sarah believe God
[1:02:16] he said and Hannah received Hannah
[1:02:19] received Samuel amen by believing the
[1:02:22] word that Sarah had given in the Bible
[1:02:26] what word did Sarah give the word
[1:02:27] Abraham
[1:02:30] believed I know this is simple when I
[1:02:33] pray
[1:02:34] open the only thing that Sarah had to do
[1:02:38] was to believe what Abraham her husband
[1:02:40] said right Abraham told he was going to
[1:02:43] have a baby what a beautiful picture of
[1:02:45] the church in Christ God spoke to
[1:02:46] Abraham and told Abraham and Sarah was
[1:02:50] Abraham's bride his wife now can I can I
[1:02:52] tell you what a prophetic warning is
[1:02:54] come in this generation said comeing
[1:02:57] this age and said these words it
[1:02:59] behooves you my brother my sister to
[1:03:01] consider what you're listening at
[1:03:05] yeah it behooves you to consider what
[1:03:09] you're listening at and don't you ever
[1:03:11] underestimate Satan's power for
[1:03:14] deceiving don't you never underestimate
[1:03:17] him he's a smooth as he can be God there
[1:03:21] is a prophetic word there is a prophetic
[1:03:23] warning that in this generation and said
[1:03:26] be careful what you're listening to he
[1:03:29] said again now see I've always asked you
[1:03:31] to be careful what you're listening to
[1:03:34] you know why because there's a
[1:03:35] connection brother between what you're
[1:03:37] listening to and what you're
[1:03:39] believing what you're hearing is what
[1:03:42] you're
[1:03:44] believing well it's the truth anyhow and
[1:03:47] said now today so many people are
[1:03:49] listening to enticing Spirits instead of
[1:03:52] taking the word of God he said Spirits
[1:03:55] they're in the world can you all agree
[1:03:57] with me that Spirits are in the world
[1:03:59] they're in our schools they're in our
[1:04:01] religious halls in in our government
[1:04:04] they're in our White House come on there
[1:04:06] I'm say there's even Spirits trying to
[1:04:08] get underneath this tent Spirits are
[1:04:11] real whether they're in the world but
[1:04:12] listen to the prophet he said they're
[1:04:17] demons and they go out into places and
[1:04:20] they get amongst men ministers they get
[1:04:22] amongst church members that are good
[1:04:24] people and they caus them to come into
[1:04:26] an illusion and they say things and do
[1:04:29] things and teach things and practice
[1:04:32] things that's contrary to the word of
[1:04:34] God see what they're trying to do is
[1:04:37] they're trying to substitute something
[1:04:39] they're trying to adopt a new plan he
[1:04:41] said education will never take the
[1:04:45] place education will never take the
[1:04:49] place of the leadership of the Holy
[1:04:52] Spirit now listen Church in enticing
[1:04:54] Spirits speak enticing
[1:04:57] words and Spirits travel on
[1:05:04] Words the Bible says my speech and my
[1:05:07] preaching was not with enticing words of
[1:05:09] man's Wisdom but in the demonstration of
[1:05:13] the spirit and of power that your faith
[1:05:15] somebody say your faith that your faith
[1:05:18] should not stand in the wisdom of men
[1:05:21] but in the power of God so Paul was
[1:05:25] speaking not enticing words but for word
[1:05:28] of God so that your faith would not
[1:05:30] stand in the wisdom of man but in the
[1:05:33] power of God see because wisdom always
[1:05:36] takes you away from God but Faith brings
[1:05:38] you back to God listen and there's only
[1:05:40] one way we can see a change this weekend
[1:05:43] is faith in the power of God see to
[1:05:46] change the man now listen church either
[1:05:49] this is the word of God or it's
[1:05:51] not either this message just a word that
[1:05:54] for or it's not either this is what's
[1:05:57] going to bring Faith or it's not I
[1:05:59] believe it is I believe that we should
[1:06:02] establish our hearts on the first night
[1:06:04] I believe we should establish our faith
[1:06:06] am brother Danny in the word and the
[1:06:08] power of God and not the WIS of
[1:06:12] man see it's all oh
[1:06:15] my
[1:06:17] sayil brother it's nothing but a hydrant
[1:06:21] educational pollution what is it it's
[1:06:24] satisfies their taste see satisfies the
[1:06:26] worldly church members taste but it
[1:06:28] don't satisfy Saints taste so a saint
[1:06:31] has a special taste and the only thing
[1:06:34] they can taste is the word of God and
[1:06:36] remember I'm I'm going come to a
[1:06:39] close by hearing and hearing the word of
[1:06:42] God you know there's a distinction then
[1:06:44] in your natural ear and your spiritual
[1:06:47] ear there's a distinction brother said
[1:06:50] watch 1933 the pope talking about coming
[1:06:52] to America going the holy to the holy
[1:06:54] lands also going to Rome he said spoke
[1:06:57] in the Orthodox Church they're all in
[1:06:58] agreement he said now to the Natural ear
[1:07:01] it's the most wonderful thing that could
[1:07:02] happen but to the spiritual ear it's
[1:07:05] Darkness Jesus
[1:07:07] said these words he that has an ear let
[1:07:10] him hear what the spirit is saying in
[1:07:13] the churches he said it may be that
[1:07:15] Millions will hear these words or read
[1:07:17] them amen but how many will pay heed to
[1:07:20] them that we do not know but he who will
[1:07:23] lend his ear and want to know the words
[1:07:25] of truth will find the spirit of God
[1:07:28] enlightening him if your ear is open to
[1:07:31] the word the spirit of God will make the
[1:07:34] word real to
[1:07:36] you if you open your spiritual ear to
[1:07:40] the word of God he make the word of God
[1:07:42] real to you come on church Faith cometh

[1:07:56] the word the word will become a reality
[1:07:59] to you and you will move from the
[1:08:01] intellectual to the supernatural I say
[1:08:03] oh god let's get on Jacob's L and cl up

[1:32:53] I said I
[1:32:57] go
[1:33:06] [Applause]
[1:33:15] way it was it was an oracle of the Lord
[1:33:19] that's what call he said it's an oracle
[1:33:21] of God that's what we've heard when you
[1:33:23] hear God speak it was an oracle of God
[1:33:25] and then Paul asked this question he
[1:33:27] said when you've heard this Oracle of
[1:33:29] God some would say what if some of the
[1:33:31] people do not believe then shall the
[1:33:34] faith of God be without effect he said
[1:33:37] God forbid but let every man's word be
[1:33:40] Al lie and let God's word be true I said
[1:33:43] we have the faith of God we don't just
[1:33:45] have faith in God but I thank God we
[1:33:47] have the faith of God the one that
[1:33:49] created the worlds into existence that
[1:33:51] kind kind of faith when there was nobody
[1:33:52] else to say Amen but he believed his own
[1:33:54] word he had the faith of Goden how many
[1:33:58] believe that today is the faith of God
[1:34:00] dwelling on the inside of youen I
[1:34:02] believe the Oracle of God a faith that
[1:34:05] is built for the
[1:34:07] supernal faith that is built for the for
[1:34:09] an answer from God but Mark he said it
[1:34:12] wasn't a worked up Faith it's a built up
[1:34:13] Faith I believe that's what God come to
[1:34:15] do to lay a foundation for Faith to be
[1:34:18] built in this to see a supernatural hand
[1:34:21] of
[1:34:22] friends I've been in tent meetings I've
[1:34:24] been in in probably 50 or 60 tent
[1:34:26] meetings I've seen the power of God move
[1:34:28] and you know what happens as people get
[1:34:30] out and they let things go and they let
[1:34:32] all the things of the life all all the
[1:34:34] pressures and all the the starchiness
[1:34:36] and everything go and just allow their
[1:34:38] faith to be in the word of God and allow
[1:34:40] God to move I don't know how many would
[1:34:42] give God Liberty to
[1:34:45] move I'm going to ask you I'm going to
[1:34:48] ask you to do the work that it takes you
[1:34:50] say what is that well tomorrow whenever
[1:34:52] you get along time with the Lord take
[1:34:54] some time and spend and some of the
[1:34:57] people that are in this meing that have
[1:34:58] needs and some people in your family I
[1:35:01] know a lot of times we want to pray for
[1:35:03] oursel and I'm just going to ask you
[1:35:04] that you'll think of some people that
[1:35:05] have needs and you'll take some time to
[1:35:07] pray for him and ask God to come and
[1:35:09] touch them in these meetings that that
[1:35:10] the Lord will have Liberty to do it how
[1:35:12] many would give me your word ra your
[1:35:14] hand that you'll do that tomorrow over
[1:35:17] the next few days may God bless you for
[1:35:18] it now we come expecting the
[1:35:20] supernatural I want to see a move of God

[1:35:24] into can I share this with they've got a
[1:35:26] dinner prepared let me just say to ease
[1:35:28] their minds they have a dinner prepared
[1:35:30] and and then I know some of you have to
[1:35:32] work tomorrow so the sisters have made
[1:35:34] to go sacks so those of you have to rush
[1:35:36] off to work they have to go sack you can
[1:35:38] just grave and go so we don't want
[1:35:39] anybody to leave without eating but
[1:35:41] those that want to stay in Fellowship
[1:35:42] you're more than welcome to we'll do
[1:35:43] that each night of the meeting and so we
[1:35:46] just want to give you the Liberty to do
[1:35:47] that but I want to share this before we
[1:35:49] go and and you know I was in a in a
[1:35:51] meeting an India tent meeting and and
[1:35:53] and it was you know just walked in there
[1:35:55] and it just you the meeting had just
[1:35:57] opened and I remember when I walked in
[1:35:59] and kind of eased and snuck out I wasn't
[1:36:01] supposed to be out there yet they kind
[1:36:02] of keep me locked away a little Hut but
[1:36:03] I snuck out into where the meeting was
[1:36:05] going on and and you know it was just
[1:36:07] just so odd because there was a little
[1:36:08] sister in the church and I watched over
[1:36:10] there some people would gather around
[1:36:12] and they started playing some music and
[1:36:13] and I I I I know the presence of God I
[1:36:16] don't know a lot of things but I
[1:36:17] recognize the presence of God I've seen
[1:36:19] God do some Miracles I've seen a lot of
[1:36:21] Miracles and people that that couldn't
[1:36:23] walk where they got up and walk and
[1:36:24] people that couldn't see that God gave
[1:36:25] them back their sight I know I have
[1:36:27] friends that are Church of Christ that
[1:36:28] call me a liar because of that but I I I
[1:36:30] can testify that I saw that with my own
[1:36:32] eyes I've seen God do the supernatural
[1:36:34] anybody here ever seen God do the
[1:36:35] supernatural I've seen Miracles I've
[1:36:37] seen God do do the miraculous I still
[1:36:40] believe in but I know the presence of
[1:36:42] God and I went to that meeting and but
[1:36:43] Mark when I Eed up there you know what
[1:36:45] it didn't feel that way it was just kind
[1:36:47] of some people sitting there and some
[1:36:49] people that were playing some music and
[1:36:51] what a lot going on but I noticed a
[1:36:52] little sister over in the back and she
[1:36:54] lifted up her hand and and she began to
[1:36:56] cry out she said Lord I Just Praise You
[1:36:58] Lord hallelujah I thank you Lord you're
[1:37:01] you're a wonderful God you're a merciful
[1:37:03] god and she began to cry out to God and
[1:37:05] it wasn't just a few seconds another
[1:37:07] lady over beside her she be to worship
[1:37:09] God and then somebody else they they
[1:37:11] started praising God and they somebody
[1:37:12] else they started worshiping God it
[1:37:14] wasn't just a few minutes the presence
[1:37:16] of the Lord started moving through that
[1:37:18] tent and before they even open the
[1:37:19] Service brother Mark the atmosphere was
[1:37:22] right for God to come and move you see
[1:37:24] what happened it was the very scripture
[1:37:26] being fulfilled where the Bible says
[1:37:28] that God inhabits the praise of his
