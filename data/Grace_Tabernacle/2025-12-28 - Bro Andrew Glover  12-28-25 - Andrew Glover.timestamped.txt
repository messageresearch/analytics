[42:50] now. I love your voice
[42:54] for you [singing] have led [music] me
[42:56] through many fires
[43:00] in the darkest [singing] night. You've
[43:02] been close like no other.
[43:07] I've known you as a [music and singing]
[43:08] father.
[43:10] You've been my dearest friend
[43:14] and I have lived in [music] the goodness
[43:18] of God. I want you to sing it to him
[43:20] with all your heart now. And I say, all
[43:24] my [singing] life,
[43:26] Lord, you have been faithful. [singing]

[43:43] I will sing of the goodness [singing] of
[43:47] God.
[43:49] [music]
[43:50] I will sing of the goodness [singing]
[43:54] of God.
[43:57] [music] Amen. How many can give him a
[43:59] hand clap of praise this morning? How
[44:01] many can testify of his goodness? Amen.
[44:04] You can testify of his mercy. You can
[44:06] testify of his grace. Amen. There's
[44:08] something about the testimony of a
[44:10] believer. Amen. It's not coming from
[44:12] something they learned in a school or
[44:14] something they memorized by a code of
[44:17] creeds or dogmas. But a believer's
[44:20] testimony is coming from an experience.
[44:22] Amen. Something that we have personally
[44:24] experienced. And you know this morning I
[44:27] woke up this morning and turned on the
[44:28] prophet of God and he just began to talk
[44:30] about how thankful he was. And he said
[44:33] something that just really uh spoke to
[44:34] my heart. He said, you know, he said,
[44:36] I've made many mistakes. He said, but
[44:39] I'm thankful for the grace of God to
[44:40] rise and try again. And I just stopped
[44:44] right there and said, thank you, Lord. I
[44:45] can identify myself right there. I've
[44:47] made many mistakes, but I'm thankful
[44:49] that God has got a grace that I can rise
[44:52] and try again. Amen. Want to say, God
[44:54] bless you all this morning. How many is
[44:56] happy to be in the house of God? Amen.
[44:58] Such [music] a such a wonderful
[45:00] atmosphere here in the building today.
[45:01] And we just want to greet you all today
[45:03] in the lovely name of our Lord and
[45:05] Savior Jesus Christ. We want to uh just
[45:07] say we pray you had a wonderful uh
[45:09] Christmas time and holidays with your
[45:11] families. And amen, the the blessings of
[45:14] God resting upon you. It is a real honor
[45:16] to be home today and to be speaking to
[45:18] you all. And amen, we thank you for your
[45:20] prayers while we were away there in
[45:21] Trinidad. Just had some wonderful
[45:23] meetings there. The Holy Spirit move and
[45:25] we were there at uh Headstone Tabernacle
[45:27] there with the believers. And so we
[45:28] bring a greetings from them and we thank
[45:31] the Lord for his mercy and grace there
[45:32] and good to see all of our visitors here
[45:34] today. Want to of course welcome brother
[45:36] Anthony and sister Maddie. God bless you
[45:38] all. Good to see you all here today. And
[45:40] brother Brian and Sister Dina I believe
[45:43] we met years ago in Indiana. Is that
[45:45] right? Amen. That's been a long time.
[45:47] Amen. It's sure good to see you all
[45:48] again. God bless you this morning. Amen.
[45:51] This morning we want to bow our hearts
[45:52] for a word of prayer. I just received a
[45:54] prayer request for Sister Kim Weeks
[45:57] there in Virginia. You all know Brother
[45:58] Kevin Weekes. He was here and his family
[46:01] with us in the meetings. It's actually
[46:02] his sister-in-law. She had a knee
[46:04] replacement several weeks ago and
[46:06] [music] is now dealing with a very
[46:08] severe uh infection in her stomach.
[46:10] They're actually going to be doing a
[46:12] procedure here shortly and it's a very
[46:14] um risky procedure, but I I know a man
[46:16] who can. Amen. Brother Brian, we know a
[46:19] God that can step on the scene. And may
[46:21] we just bow our hearts this morning for
[46:22] a word of prayer and approach him.
[46:23] Heavenly Father, Lord, as your believers
[46:26] have gathered here this morning on this,
[46:28] Lord, beautiful resurrection Sunday that
[46:30] you've given us, Father, with joy in our
[46:32] hearts, with a song in our mouths, oh
[46:34] God, with praise upon our lips unto you.
[46:37] Lord, we are so thankful this morning
[46:39] that we can approach you. We can
[46:41] approach you by the way of prayer. We
[46:43] can come into your presence this
[46:44] morning. And father, we can present our
[46:46] petitions before you knowing that you're
[46:48] more than able to move upon them. And
[46:51] Father, we bring Sister Kim before you
[46:53] this morning, Lord. A dear sister in
[46:54] Christ. Father, a faithful veteran and
[46:57] soldier of this gospel for many, many
[46:59] years. And Lord, you see her there this
[47:01] morning in the hospital there in
[47:03] Virginia, afflicted in her body. And
[47:05] Lord, we may not be there in physical
[47:07] form to to lay our hands upon her and
[47:09] pray with her. But Lord, I know the
[47:11] angel of God is ever present. And Lord,
[47:14] I pray you would pass by that hospital
[47:15] room this morning, I pray, oh God, Lord,
[47:18] that before the doctors would even touch
[47:20] her, Lord, may you drive that infection
[47:21] out of her body, Lord, may you bring a
[47:24] great healing virtue through her, Lord.
[47:26] Father, I pray for this meeting this
[47:28] morning that you would come among us in
[47:30] a special way. Lord, as these believers
[47:33] have gathered here today, Lord, I have
[47:35] nothing in my human self to offer them,
[47:37] but Lord, we have a message and we
[47:39] believe that is the king's message. And
[47:41] I pray this morning you would help me to
[47:43] get myself out of the way that Lord
[47:45] liberty could come among us and Lord
[47:47] that we could deliver the things that
[47:48] you brought to our attention in your
[47:50] word. Now Father, I pray if there be any
[47:52] sick among us today, even in this
[47:54] building, may you heal them. If there be
[47:56] any bound, may you deliver them. Oh God,
[47:58] if there be any empty, may you fill
[47:59] them. And Lord, when we would leave this
[48:01] place today, may we be able to say like
[48:03] those on the Emmas road, did not our
[48:05] hearts burn within us as he came and
[48:08] talked to us along the way. Not as
[48:10] brother Andrew talked to us or any other
[48:12] man. But Lord, as you, the son of man,
[48:14] would walk among this congregation
[48:16] today. Lord, you would reveal yourself
[48:18] into our hearts. We'll be sure to give
[48:20] thee all the praise, all the honor, and
[48:22] all the glory. For it's in the wonderful
[48:24] name of our Lord and Savior Jesus
[48:26] Christ. We pray. And all the believers
[48:29] says, "Amen." And amen. Won't you say it
[48:31] like a believer this morning? Amen.
[48:34] Amen. We We say, "God bless you today."
[48:36] If you have your Bibles, while you're
[48:37] standing, we want to go uh to the book
[48:40] of Malachi, the 4th chapter. Uh we just
[48:42] have one service here today. So, we want
[48:44] to take a few moments here in the word
[48:46] of the Lord. Amen. Malachi, the 4th
[48:49] chapter, and then we want to go to the
[48:51] book of Jude, the first chapter. Amen.
[48:53] It's just a it's just a good day to
[48:55] serve the Lord, isn't it?
[48:57] &gt;&gt; Amen. The blessings of God upon our
[48:58] lives, and Amen. We we thank the Lord
[49:01] for that. Malachi chapter 4 and verse
[49:04] number five.
[49:06] Very very familiar scripture here.
[49:09] Behold, I will send you Elijah the
[49:12] prophet before the coming of the great
[49:14] and dreadful day of the Lord. And notice
[49:17] this. And he shall turn the heart of the
[49:21] fathers to the children and the heart of
[49:24] the children to their fathers. Brother
[49:26] Bham said, or restore the faith. Now,
[49:29] lest I come and smite the earth with a
[49:32] curse. I also want to go to the book of
[49:34] Jude chapter 1. Jude chapter 1. It's
[49:38] that little little book just a just one
[49:41] chapter between the three epistles of
[49:43] John and the book of Revelation. In Jude
[49:46] chapter 1 in verse number one,
[49:50] Jude the servant of Jesus Christ, the
[49:53] brother of James, to them that are
[49:55] sanctified by God the Father. Brother
[49:58] Brham stopped and said that's not the
[49:59] unbeliever. He said that's the
[50:01] sanctified set aside ones in Christ and
[50:05] preserved in Jesus Christ and called
[50:08] mercy unto you and peace and love be
[50:11] multiplied. Now beloved, when I gave all
[50:14] diligence to write unto you of the
[50:16] common salvation, it was needful for me
[50:19] to write unto you and to exhort you that
[50:22] ye should earnestly contend for the
[50:25] faith. Somebody say contend for the
[50:26] faith.
[50:28] contend for the faith which was once
[50:30] delivered unto the saints. So this is
[50:33] not a new faith, but it's a restoration
[50:36] of the original faith. For there are
[50:38] certain men crept in unawares who were
[50:41] before of old ordained to this
[50:44] condemnation, ungodly men turning the
[50:47] grace of our God into listiviousness.
[50:50] Watch this. and denying the only Lord
[50:53] God and our Lord Jesus Christ. Amen. We
[50:57] ask Lord this morning to bless the
[50:59] reading of his word as you can have your
[51:00] seat here today uh from those passages
[51:03] of scripture this morning if I would uh
[51:05] take a title to speak to you here today
[51:07] for a few moments. I want to talk to you
[51:08] on this um contending for the faith.
[51:12] Amen. Contending for the faith. I'm
[51:14] actually going to begin this this
[51:16] morning and Lord willing take it in
[51:17] another portion on on Wednesday. But
[51:19] tonight uh this morning rather just to
[51:20] to lay a foundation in this contending
[51:23] for the faith. Brother Brham said this
[51:24] is the only scripture in the Bible that
[51:26] I know of that we are commanded to
[51:29] contend. We are to keep contentions away
[51:32] from us. He said but here we are to
[51:35] contend for the faith. He said the faith
[51:37] that was once delivered unto the saints.
[51:40] Now I may be to take a a portion out of
[51:43] that contending for the faith. I want to
[51:44] speak to you on this. The bride's
[51:46] contention. Amen. the bride's
[51:48] contention. Brother B said, "There has
[51:50] been churches, churches. There has been
[51:52] brides, brides, churches, brides,
[51:53] brides." He says, "But there has got to
[51:56] come one." How many believes that
[51:57] there's got to come one? There has to
[51:59] come a real bride. There's must come one
[52:02] that's not only got the mechanics of it,
[52:04] but they've got the dynamics, he said,
[52:07] that will make the church live and move
[52:09] in the power of his resurrection. 1953.
[52:14] I say this today. If you believe me to
[52:16] be God's servant, you are now living in
[52:19] the day of the restoration of the faith
[52:22] that was once delivered to the saints.
[52:24] Amen. Amen. There's no longer a question
[52:26] of what day we are living in. We now
[52:28] have a vindicated prophet declaring we
[52:31] are living in the day of the restoration
[52:34] of the faith. We are living under the
[52:36] power, amen, of the latter reign of the
[52:39] Holy Ghost raising up today and calling.
[52:42] He says great doctors and divinities out
[52:45] of everything, amen, out of all the
[52:47] denominations. Again, he'll say it like
[52:49] this. What we need today, Amen, is a
[52:52] contending for the faith. Now, I believe
[52:54] I can say to you this morning that we
[52:56] are living in the time, Amen. This is
[52:58] not Moses's day. Amen. This is not
[53:01] David's day. This is not Paul's day.
[53:03] This is not Peter's day. Amen. But I
[53:06] believe this is the bride's day. I I
[53:08] believe this is the opportunity for the
[53:10] real bride of Jesus Christ. Amen. I
[53:12] believe this is your opportunity to
[53:14] contend. Re said if you would have lived
[53:16] in the days gone by when they when they
[53:18] crucified Jesus, well, you would say, "I
[53:20] would have stood for him. I I would have
[53:22] given my life for him." Well, he said,
[53:24] "You have more of an opportunity to do
[53:27] that now." Amen. Than you would in them
[53:29] days. Amen. Stand now. Amen. The
[53:32] opposition is greater today. Amen. Than
[53:36] it was then. Now, amen. I can say then
[53:38] that we are living in what Paul will
[53:40] call, AMEN, A PERPLEXED TIME. In 2
[53:42] Corinthians 4 and verse 8, he will say
[53:45] we are troubled on every side. How many
[53:47] can testify? Amen. YET NOT DISTRESSED.
[53:50] WE WE ARE PERPLEXED BUT NOT in despair.
[53:53] I love that word perplexed. It means to
[53:55] stand in doubt. It means to be without
[53:58] resources, not to know, Amen. which way
[54:00] to turn. How many's ever been there?
[54:02] Amen. You don't know which way to turn.
[54:04] Now look at this word despair. It means
[54:06] to be utterly at loss, it means utterly
[54:09] destitute of measures or resources. It
[54:12] means to renounce all hope. So when one
[54:15] is perplexed, amen, they don't know
[54:17] which way to turn. Amen. But they are
[54:19] not in despair. They don't they're not
[54:21] renouncing their hope. Now, amen, that
[54:24] word renounce, it means to formally
[54:26] declare, amen, ONE'S ABANDONMENT OF A
[54:29] claim of a right or a possession. I want
[54:31] to say this morning in these perplexed
[54:33] times, amen, we may be faced with
[54:36] situations. WE WE MAY NOT KNOW WHICH WAY
[54:38] TO TURN. WE MAY NOT KNOW WHAT TO DO. BUT
[54:41] there is one thing that this bride will
[54:43] not do is we will not renounce our hope.
[54:46] Amen. AMEN. OUR HOPE IS NOT IN A CHURCH.
[54:49] AMEN. OUR HOPE IS NOT in a preacher. OUR
[54:51] HOPE IS NOT AMEN IN THE PRESIDENT OR IN
[54:54] THE IN THE GOVERNMENT OF THE WORLD. OUR
[54:56] HOPE IS IN GOD. AMEN. AND A PROPHET SAID
[54:58] THAT'S OUR ONLY HOPE WE HAVE. AMEN. IS
[55:01] NOT THE ATOMIC BOMB. AMEN. Our hope is
[55:04] in Jesus Christ and Christ is the
[55:07] answer. Amen. Then if this HOPE IS IN
[55:09] YOU, Peter said, Amen. Be ready always
[55:12] to give an answer, amen, to every man
[55:15] that askketh you a reason, amen, of the
[55:18] hope that is in you. BROTHER SAID, "IF I
[55:20] CAN TESTIFY, AMEN, to the hope that lays
[55:22] within me, well, it'll be a blessing for
[55:25] me to tell you, and I hope it'll be a
[55:27] blessing to you to receive it." AMEN.
[55:29] AND KNOW THROUGH YOUR FAITH, AMEN. It
[55:32] corresponds with the same thing. Now, I
[55:34] want you to hear this. AND THE SAME
[55:36] FAITH, SOMEBODY SAY, "THE same faith."
[55:38] The same faith that's in me, amen, LAYS
[55:42] IN YOU. AMEN. ISN'T THAT POWERFUL? WE
[55:44] ARE FELLOW CITIZENS, AMEN, OF THE
[55:47] KINGDOM OF GOD. AMEN. SO, BROTHER
[55:48] BRANDHAM DIDN'T HAVE ONE faith and you
[55:50] got another. AMEN. BROTHER MATT DON'T
[55:52] HAVE ONE FAITH AND YOU HAVE ANOTHER.
[55:54] AMEN. But the SAME FAITH THAT WAS IN THE
[55:57] BIBLE. AMEN. THE SAME FAITH THAT WAS IN
[55:59] THE PROPHETS. THE SAME FAITH THAT WAS IN
[56:01] THE DISCIPLES AND WAS IN THE APOSTLES.
[56:03] AMEN. HAS COME INTO THE BRIDE BODY OF
[56:06] JESUS CHRIST. AMEN. BY THE BAPTISM OF
[56:08] THE HOLY GHOST. NOW,
[56:10] &gt;&gt; that faith, AMEN, IS NOT JUST MAKING US
[56:13] FEEL GOOD.
[56:15] &gt;&gt; THAT FAITH IS NOT JUST EXCITING US.
[56:17] AMEN. BUT THAT THAT FAITH IS BRINGING US
[56:20] TO THE REALITY THAT WE ARE LIVING IN A
[56:22] VERY PROPHETIC TIME. NOW, AMEN. THE
[56:24] BIBLE PROPHESIED IN 2 Thessalonians 2,
[56:27] Paul said, amen, THAT THERE WILL COME A
[56:29] FALLEN AWAY. RIGHT? He said, I beseech
[56:31] you, brethren, by the coming of our Lord
[56:33] Jesus Christ and by our gathering
[56:35] together unto him. Now, look what he
[56:36] says in verse two. THAT YOU BE NOT SOON
[56:38] SHAKEN IN MIND. AMEN. AMEN. OR BE
[56:41] TROUBLED neither by spirit. Amen. nor by
[56:44] word, nor by letter as from us, as the
[56:46] day of Christ is at hand. He says, "Now
[56:49] let no man deceive you by any means. For
[56:52] that day shall not come except THERE
[56:55] COME A FALLING AWAY FIRST and the man of
[56:57] sin be revealed." Amen. The son of
[57:00] predition. I I CAN SAY WHAT A PROPHET
[57:02] SAID. We are living in the last days. We
[57:04] We are living in the end time. One place
[57:06] you'll say, "WE ARE LIVING IN THE END OF
[57:08] THE END." AMEN. THE TIME HAS COME WHERE
[57:10] there is a falling away. The Bible SAID
[57:13] IF THERE DON'T COME A FALLEN AWAY, the
[57:14] man of sin won't reveal himself. He said
[57:17] the Pentecostal church is living in the
[57:19] final of all times. The time has come.
[57:22] Amen. The time has come for signs to
[57:24] follow believers. He said we're at the
[57:27] end. We're in the latter rain. We're at
[57:28] the time. Amen. When men will be heady
[57:30] and high-minded, lovers of pleasure,
[57:32] lovers of God, more than lovers of God,
[57:34] truce breakers, false accusers,
[57:36] INCONTINENT, DESPISERS OF THOSE THAT ARE
[57:39] GOOD. Now listen, the time has come when
[57:42] they're teaching doctrines of devils,
[57:44] amen, and perverting the BIBLE'S
[57:46] TEACHING INTO THEORIES AND THEOLOGIES.
[57:49] NOW, WHY ARE THEY DOING THIS? AMEN. TO
[57:52] DRAW groups of people, amen, away after
[57:55] them. NOW, WATCH THIS. AMEN. BUT THE
[57:58] TIME HAS COME, AMEN, WHEN GOD WILL
[58:00] GATHER HIS CHURCH TOGETHER. HE SAID,
[58:02] "THE TIME HAS come for Jesus to come."
[58:05] AMEN. THE TIME HAS COME, AMEN, FOR THE
[58:08] GATHERING OF THE PEOPLE. LISTEN, THE SON
[58:11] OF PREDITION, AMEN, IS GATHERING HIS
[58:13] PEOPLE, AMEN, BY PERVERTED TEACHINGS ON
[58:16] THE WORD OF GOD. BUT THE SON OF MAN IS
[58:19] GATHERING HIS PEOPLE BY THE ORIGINAL
[58:21] TEACHING OF MALACHI 4 AND LUKE 17:30.
[58:25] LISTEN, WE'RE NOT FOLLOWING A BUNCH OF
[58:27] CUNNINGLY DEVISED FABLES. WE'RE NOT
[58:29] FOLLOWING THE IDEAS OF THE CHURCH. WE
[58:31] ARE BACK IN THE BIBLE WITH A FAITH THAT
[58:33] GOD GAVE US IN THE HOUR THAT we're
[58:35] living in. I say if there's ever been a
[58:37] time, amen, that you're going to do
[58:39] ANYTHING FOR GOD, AMEN, now is the time
[58:42] to do it.
[58:44] &gt;&gt; Amen. I can say it like Peter SAID, THE
[58:46] END OF ALL THINGS IS AT HAND. How many
[58:48] agrees?
[58:49] &gt;&gt; BROTHER B SAID, NOW WATCH THAT SEVENTH
[58:51] SEAL. It's the end OF ALL THINGS. IT'S
[58:54] THE END OF STRUGGLING NATURE. IT'S THE
[58:56] END OF THE church age. And everything
[58:58] ends on that seventh seal. It's the
[59:00] ushering in of the millennium. Now, I
[59:03] can say this. There cannot be an end
[59:05] time until there's a falling AWAY.
[59:07] RIGHT? RE SAID, "AND PAUL SAID, AMEN.
[59:10] THERE'LL BE A FALLING AWAY." NOW, WHAT
[59:12] WILL THERE BE A FALLING away from? From
[59:14] the real Pentecostal faith. AMEN. THE
[59:17] PENTECOSTAL FAITH WILL BE DONE AWAY with
[59:20] and dignitaries will be set in. THEY'LL
[59:22] HAVE A MAN TAKE THE PLACE OF GOD WHO
[59:25] WILL SIT IN THE TEMPLE OF GOD AND OPPOSE
[59:26] HIMSELF ABOVE ALL THE PEOPLE. HE SAID,
[59:29] "NOW WATCH. THAT'S NICO OVERCOMING THE
[59:31] LEOTY AND ALL THAT'S CALLED GOD. NOW
[59:34] WATCH THIS. PAUL SAID IT WOULD HAPPEN."
[59:36] AND HERE WE ARE RIGHT HERE NOW AND SEE
[59:39] THE FALLING AWAY AND SEE THE CHURCH
[59:41] GETTING further and further away. Amen.
[59:44] From it and going right back again.
[59:46] WE'RE AT THE END TIME. NOW WATCH THIS.
[59:48] THERE'S A FALLING AWAY, AMEN, BY OR
[59:51] FALLING AWAY FROM PENTECOSTAL FAITH. BUT
[59:54] BRINGS IT ON DOWN AND HE SAYS THERE'LL
[59:56] BE A CHURCH THAT'LL FALL AWAY FROM BIBLE
[59:58] FAITH. AMEN. AMEN. SEE, WHAT ARE they
[1:00:00] doing? They're organizing themselves
[1:00:02] together. They are cooperating. THEY'RE
[1:00:04] THEY'RE BINDING THEMSELVES TOGETHER. HE
[1:00:06] SAID, "NOW WATCH." AND THEY DON'T EVEN
[1:00:08] BELIEVE IN THE BIBLE. THEY DON'T EVEN
[1:00:10] believe in the REAL TRUE WORD OF GOD.
[1:00:12] YOU SAY, "WELL, THE BIBLE SAYS THIS."
[1:00:14] THEY SAY, "THEN THINGS ARE PASSED.
[1:00:16] THERE'S NO SUCH A THING AS DIVINE
[1:00:18] HEALING. THERE'S NO SUCH A THING AS
[1:00:19] MIRACLES." HE SAID, "NOW LISTEN, WHAT IS
[1:00:22] THAT SEED? It's maturing. IT'S THE END
[1:00:25] TIME SIGN SEED." WHEN YOU BEGIN TO SEE
[1:00:28] PEOPLE, AMEN, DENYING THE FOUNDATION OF
[1:00:31] THE GOSPEL, AMEN, THAT'S NOT THE TIME TO
[1:00:35] BECOME PERPLEXED AND TO RENOUNCE ALL
[1:00:37] YOUR HOPE. THAT IS THE TIME TO LIFT UP
[1:00:40] YOUR HEAD. AMEN. BECAUSE YOUR REDEMPTION
[1:00:43] IS DRAWING NIGH. THIS IS NOT THE TIME TO
[1:00:45] BECOME HELPLESS. THIS IS NOT THE TIME TO
[1:00:48] BECOME HOPELESS. THIS IS NOT THE TIME TO
[1:00:50] BECOME WEAK IN FAITH AND TO BECOME FAINT
[1:00:52] AND HARD. IF THERE'S EVER BEEN A TIME TO
[1:00:54] SHARPEN YOUR SWORD. IF THERE'S EVER BEEN
[1:00:56] A TIME, AMEN, TO STAND TOE-TO-TOE WITH
[1:00:59] THE DEVIL. THE SON OF PREDITION HAS BEEN
[1:01:01] REVEALED. BUT SO HAS THE SON OF MAN HAS
[1:01:04] COME IN THIS HOUR WITH A FAITH THAT'LL
[1:01:07] DELIVER YOU FROM THE TEMPTATION THAT HAS
[1:01:09] COME UPON the world. My when you see
[1:01:12] these things happening, Amen. LIFT UP
[1:01:14] YOUR HEAD. YOUR REDEMPTION IS DRAWING
[1:01:16] NIGH. I THINK IT'S POWERFUL. AMEN. THAT
[1:01:19] THAT GOD DEALS IN THE PROPHETIC. HOW
[1:01:21] MANY KNOWS THAT HE HAS A PROPHETIC CLASS
[1:01:24] OF PEOPLE?
[1:01:26] &gt;&gt; How many can agree you are that that
[1:01:28] prophetic class?
[1:01:29] &gt;&gt; NOW WATCH THIS. THEN IF GOD HAS A
[1:01:32] PROPHETIC WORD AND HE HAS A PROPHETIC
[1:01:34] CLASS OF PEOPLE, THEN SURELY HE HAS A
[1:01:36] PROPHETIC TIME, RIGHT? THEN I CAN SAY WE
[1:01:39] ARE LIVING IN THE PROPHETIC TIME. WE ARE
[1:01:41] LIVING IN A TIME, now I want you TO HEAR
[1:01:43] THIS, WHEN THERE ARE TWO SEPARATE Bible
[1:01:46] prophecies being fulfilled at the same
[1:01:49] time. Are you with me? Now I can show it
[1:01:51] to you. 1 Timothy 4:1, it says, "NOW THE
[1:01:54] SPIRIT SPEAKETH EXPRESSLY THAT IN THE
[1:01:56] LATTER times some shall depart from the
[1:02:00] faith." NOW I LOVE THAT IT DON'T SAY
[1:02:02] ALL.
[1:02:03] &gt;&gt; IT SAYS SOME SHALL DEPART FROM THE
[1:02:06] FAITH. NOW THEY WILL GIVE HEED to
[1:02:07] seducing spirits AND DOCTRINES OF
[1:02:10] DEVILS. LISTEN. THEY WILL SPEAK LIES IN
[1:02:12] HYPOCRISY. THEY WILL HAVE their
[1:02:15] conscience seared WITH A HOT IRON. NOW
[1:02:18] WATCH THIS WORD DEPART. IT MEANS TO DRAW
[1:02:20] AWAY. It means to refrain. It means to
[1:02:23] withdraw self. It means to excite, to
[1:02:26] revolt. IT MEANS TO DESERT. SO WHEN ONE
[1:02:30] BEGINS TO DEPART FROM THE FAITH, THEY
[1:02:32] BEGIN to draw THEMSELVES AWAY. THEY
[1:02:35] BEGIN TO BECOME HOSTILE AND THEY BEGIN
[1:02:38] TO DESERT WHAT THEY SHOULD BE HOLDING ON
[1:02:40] TO. Brother said, "Look, those Jews,
[1:02:42] THEY FAILED TO RECOGNIZE JESUS." AMEN.
[1:02:45] AS THE FULFILLMENT OF THE PROPHECY THAT
[1:02:47] A MESSIAH WOULD COME, he said, "Now,
[1:02:49] what did they do?" HE SAID, "THEY BECOME
[1:02:51] HOSTILE TOWARDS HIM AND THEY CRUCIFIED
[1:02:54] HIM." HE SAID, "AND THAT SAME SPIRIT
[1:02:56] THAT SPOKE THROUGH HOSEA," AMEN. SPOKE
[1:02:58] THROUGH JOHN AND SAID, "IN THE LAST
[1:03:00] DAYS, THE CHURCH WOULD BE NAKED,
[1:03:03] WRETCHED, MISERABLE, POOR, and blind."
[1:03:05] HE SAID, "NOW WATCH THIS. THEY WILL
[1:03:06] BECOME HOSTILE TOWARDS THE MESSAGE."
[1:03:09] AMEN. [laughter] I I WANT TO SAY THIS TO
[1:03:10] YOU VERY PLAINLY. AMEN. WHEN YOU WHEN
[1:03:12] YOU BECOME HOSTILE TOWARDS THE MESSAGE,
[1:03:14] IT'S NOT THAT YOU'RE BECOMING HOSTILE,
[1:03:17] AMEN, TOWARDS BROTHER BRANDHAM or
[1:03:18] towards Brother Matt or any other
[1:03:20] PREACHER OR CHURCH, IT'S ACTUALLY YOU'RE
[1:03:22] COMING HOSTILE, AMEN, TOWARDS THE
[1:03:24] FULFILLMENT OF THE WORD OF GOD. LISTEN,
[1:03:27] THIS MESSAGE IS NOT A MAN, FOLKS. IT'S
[1:03:29] NOT A PREACHER. AMEN. IT'S NOT A
[1:03:31] PERSONALITY. THIS MESSAGE IS THE BIBLE
[1:03:34] BEING FULFILLED BY THE SPIRIT OF TRUTH
[1:03:37] WHO SENT IT INTO THE AGE YOU'RE LIVING
[1:03:39] IN. AMEN. NOW, WATCH THIS. THERE WILL BE
[1:03:41] SOME WHO WILL DEPART FROM THE FAITH.
[1:03:43] AIN'T IT FUNNY? AMEN. PEOPLE SIT ON A
[1:03:45] PEW FOR 20 YEARS AND NEVER DO NOTHING
[1:03:47] FOR THE FAITH, BUT THEY FIND ONE LITTLE
[1:03:50] MISTAKE. AMEN. AND THEY THEY THEY BECOME
[1:03:52] HOSTILE AND THEY GO AROUND THE WORLD
[1:03:54] TRYING TO SPREAD a bunch OF A BUNCH OF
[1:03:56] NONSENSE. AMEN. AND THE ONLY THING
[1:03:58] THEY'RE TRYING TO DO IS TEAR YOUR FAITH
[1:04:00] DOWN. AMEN. SO YOU WILL FOLLOW THEM.
[1:04:03] AMEN. BUT I WANT TO SAY THIS, THAT'S ONE
[1:04:05] BIBLE PROPHECY. AMEN. BUT THERE'S A
[1:04:07] SECOND BIBLE PROPHECY. AND IT'S OVER IN
[1:04:09] the book of Jude, THE FIRST CHAPTER,
[1:04:11] WHEN HE SAID, "IT WAS NEED FOR ME TO
[1:04:12] WRITE UNTO YOU AND EXHORT YOU THAT YOU
[1:04:15] SHOULD EARNESTLY contend for the faith
[1:04:18] THAT WAS ONCE DELIVERED TO the saints."
[1:04:20] LISTEN, THIS WAS 33 YEARS AFTER
[1:04:23] PENTECOST. And Jude BEGINS TO WRITE
[1:04:25] THIS. AND A PROPHET COMES ALONG AND
[1:04:27] SAYS, "NOW, WHAT IS TO CONTEND?" He
[1:04:30] says, "Contend is to debate." I love
[1:04:32] that. I'm going somewhere with that.
[1:04:34] Amen. CONTEND IS TO DEBATE OR TO STAND
[1:04:37] THERE AND HOLD FAST ON YOUR CONVICTION.
[1:04:41] &gt;&gt; WHEN YOU ARE CONTENDING, YOU ARE
[1:04:43] STANDING FAST AND YOU'RE HOLDING ON TO
[1:04:46] YOUR CONVICTION. I LOVE THIS. 1955 HE
[1:04:49] SAID NOW TO CONTEND MEANS NOT TO ARGUE
[1:04:52] EXACTLY BUT OTHERWISE HOLD FAST. AMEN.
[1:04:56] OR UPHOLD AND STAY PUT WITH IT AS WE
[1:04:59] CALL IN THE STREET EXPRESSION. I WANT
[1:05:01] YOU TO EARNESTLY NOW WHAT DID HE SAY?
[1:05:03] EARNESTLY CONTEND. REB SAID NOT JUST
[1:05:06] HALFHEARTEDLY BUT WITH ALL YOUR SOUL AND
[1:05:09] ALL YOUR MIGHT. AMEN. Contend for the
[1:05:12] faith that was once delivered to the
[1:05:14] saints. AMEN. CAN I SAY SOMETHING TO
[1:05:16] YOU? AMEN. SOME ARE DEPARTING FROM THE
[1:05:19] FAITH. AMEN. BUT OTHERS ARE CONTENDING
[1:05:22] FOR THE FAITH. AMEN. THERE'S TWO BIBLE
[1:05:25] PROPHECIES ACTUALLY HAPPENING BEFORE
[1:05:27] YOUR EYES. AMEN. SOME ARE DEPARTING, BUT
[1:05:30] SOME ARE CONTENDING. AMEN. NOW, THIS
[1:05:33] DEPARTURE DIDN'T JUST HAPPEN IN THIS
[1:05:35] AGE, BUT ALL THE WAY BACK IN THE THIRD
[1:05:37] AGE, IN THE PERGAMIAN CHURCH AGE, A
[1:05:39] PROPHET SAID, "WE HAVE TWO CHURCHES
[1:05:41] BEARING THE SAME NAME, BUT WITH A BITTER
[1:05:44] DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THEM." HE SAID, "ONE
[1:05:47] HAS DEPARTED FROM THE TRUTH. SHE HAS
[1:05:49] MARRIED IDOLS AND HAS NO LIFE IN HER.
[1:05:52] SHE HAS HYBRIDIZED HERSELF AND THE SIGNS
[1:05:55] OF DEATH, NOT LIFE FOLLOWING HER WAKE.
[1:05:57] SHE IS POWERFUL WITH MANY MEMBERS AND
[1:06:00] SHE IS FAVORED BY THE WORLD." NOW,
[1:06:02] THAT'S THE GROUP THAT HAS DEPARTED FROM
[1:06:04] THE FAITH. SHE IS POWERFUL IN MEMBERS.
[1:06:07] SHE IS FAVORED BY THE WORLD. BUT THERE
[1:06:09] IS ANOTHER GROUP AND BEN SAID IT'S A
[1:06:12] LITTLE PERSECUTED GROUP BUT SHE FOLLOWS
[1:06:14] THE WORD AND THE SIGNS FOLLOW HER. OH
[1:06:17] CHURCH OF THE LIVING GOD, I DON'T KNOW
[1:06:19] WHAT YOU'RE GOING THROUGH THIS MORNING.
[1:06:21] BUT IF YOU HAVE GOT EYES TO SEE AND YOU
[1:06:23] GOT EARS TO HEAR and you got a HEART TO
[1:06:26] BELIEVE THIS MESSAGE. YOU OUGHT TO PUT
[1:06:28] YOUR SHOUTING SHOES ON IN THE HOUSE OF
[1:06:30] GOD. THE WORLD HAS DEPARTED. SHE IS
[1:06:33] FAVORED BY the world. SHE IS ADMIRED BY
[1:06:35] THE WORLD, BUT SHE IS REJECTED BY GOD.
[1:06:38] BUT THERE'S A LITTLE FAITH WOMAN WHO HAS
[1:06:40] BEEN RESTORED BY THE MINISTRY OF THE
[1:06:43] SEVENTH ANGEL. SHE MAY BE PERSECUTED,
[1:06:45] BUT SHE'S GOT LIFE AND SHE'S GOT THE
[1:06:48] POWER OF GOD AND SHE'S GOT THE GRACE OF
[1:06:50] GOD UPON HER LIFE. YES, SIR. AMEN. In
[1:06:53] her the SICK ARE HEALED. IN HER the dead
[1:06:56] are raised. SHE IS ALIVE WITH THE LIFE
[1:07:00] AND WORD OF GOD. LISTEN. SHE LOVES NOT
[1:07:02] HER LIFE, BUT HOLDS TO HIS NAME and his
[1:07:06] faith even unto death. Now, ACCORDING TO
[1:07:10] SCRIPTURE, THEN THERE IS ONLY ONE FAITH.
[1:07:12] CAN I SAY SOMETHING TO YOU? THERE'S NOT
[1:07:14] A BAPTIST FAITH, SAINTS.
[1:07:16] &gt;&gt; THERE'S NOT A METHODIST FAITH.
[1:07:18] &gt;&gt; THERE'S NOT A PENTECOSTAL DENOMINATIONAL
[1:07:21] FAITH. THERE'S NOT A CATHOLIC FAITH.
[1:07:23] THERE'S NOT A THERE'S NOT A LUTHERAN
[1:07:25] FAITH, BROTHER DAVID. AMEN. THERE'S NOT
[1:07:27] A THERE'S NOT A HOW CAN I SAY IT?
[1:07:30] THERE'S NOT A MAN-MADE FAITH IN THE
[1:07:32] BIBLE.
[1:07:33] &gt;&gt; NOW WATCH THIS. ACCORDING TO PAUL IN
[1:07:35] EPHESIANS 4 AND VERSE 5, HE SAYS THERE'S
[1:07:38] ONE LORD.
[1:07:39] &gt;&gt; HE SAYS THERE'S ONE FAITH AND HE SAYS
[1:07:41] THERE'S ONE BAPTISM. BROTHER REM COMES
[1:07:43] ALONG AND SAYS THEN CONTEND FOR THE
[1:07:45] FAITH, NOT A FAITH. So if IT'S A
[1:07:48] METHODIST FAITH, IT'S A FAITH. IF IT'S A
[1:07:50] BAPTIST FAITH, IT'S A FAITH. BUT IF IT'S
[1:07:53] COMING FROM THE BIBLE, IT'S THE FAITH.
[1:07:56] AND THERE'S ONLY ONE REALLY one faith.
[1:07:58] There's one Lord, one God, AND ONE
[1:07:59] BAPTISM. NOW, MANY PEOPLE SAYS, "THAT'S
[1:08:02] AGAINST MY FAITH." HE SAID, "BUT LISTEN,
[1:08:04] THERE'S ONLY ONE THE FAITH." HEARD HIM
[1:08:07] SAY IT LAST NIGHT. HE SAID, "WELL, YOU
[1:08:09] SAY, "I DON'T BELIEVE IN THAT DIVINE
[1:08:10] HEALING. IT'S AGAINST MY FAITH." HE
[1:08:12] SAID, "IT'S THE WORD OF GOD." SO, IS THE
[1:08:14] WORD OF GOD AGAINST YOUR FAITH?
[1:08:16] &gt;&gt; NOW, COME ON. WHAT KIND OF FAITH HAVE
[1:08:18] YOU GOT THAT WHEN SOMETHING IS PREACHED
[1:08:20] FROM THE WORD OF GOD, IT OFFENDS YOU?
[1:08:22] WHAT KIND OF FAITH HAVE YOU GOT WHEN
[1:08:24] SOMETHING IS REVEALED BY the revealing
[1:08:27] of the son OF MAN AND IT DON'T BRING A
[1:08:29] JOY INTO YOUR HEART? IT BRINGS A IT
[1:08:31] BRINGS A FINE SPIRIT. I TELL YOU WHAT
[1:08:33] KIND OF FAITH YOU GOT. YOU GOT A
[1:08:35] HYBRIDIZED FAITH AND IT'S NOT COME FROM
[1:08:37] THIS BIBLE. IT HAS NOT COME FROM GOD. IT
[1:08:39] HAS COME FROM THE DEVIL. BUT IN THE
[1:08:41] EVENING TIME, IT SHALL BE LIGHT. WHEN
[1:08:44] THE MESSAGE OF MALACHI 4 SHALL BEGIN TO
[1:08:47] SAIL, THERE WILL BE A RESTORATION in the
[1:08:50] FAITH OF THE CHURCH. IT'LL BE THE FAITH
[1:08:52] OF GOD.
[1:08:54] &gt;&gt; Reverend said, "There's only one WAY TO
[1:08:56] BE POSITIVE, SURE, THIS NIGHT IS TO GO
[1:08:58] BACK AND SEE WHAT KIND OF FAITH THEY HAD
[1:09:01] TO CONTEND FOR. And then we should
[1:09:04] EARNESTLY CONTEND FOR THAT TYPE OF
[1:09:06] FAITH." I LOVE THIS. HE SAYS, "THE FIRST
[1:09:08] ONE TO INTRODUCE THE MESSAGE," I LOVE
[1:09:11] THAT. THE FIRST ONE TO INTRODUCE THE
[1:09:13] MESSAGE, BROTHER BRIAN, OF OR THE FAITH
[1:09:16] WOULD BE OUR LORD JESUS CHRIST.
[1:09:19] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[1:09:19] &gt;&gt; AMEN. JOHN JUST INTRODUCED THE LORD
[1:09:22] JESUS AND JESUS WAS THE PRODUCT OF WHAT
[1:09:25] GOD INTENDED FOR US TO CONTEND FOR. HE
[1:09:28] WAS THE WHOLE OF THE CHRISTIAN FAITH.
[1:09:31] NOW LISTEN, IT LAID in Jesus Christ in
[1:09:34] our faith in him. Look here, HE SAID,
[1:09:37] NOW SEE, THEY WASN'T CONTENDING FOR SOME
[1:09:40] HISTORICAL AFFAIR, BUT THEY were
[1:09:42] contending FOR A LIVING CHRIST. THEY
[1:09:46] WERE CONTENDING FOR A RESURRECTED ONE
[1:09:48] WHO WAS IN THEIR MIDST. NOW WATCH THIS.
[1:09:51] WE ARE NOT CONTENDING FOR REASONINGS.
[1:09:55] AMEN. WE ARE CONTENDING FOR FAITH.
[1:09:57] BROTHER SAID YOU CANNOT GO REFER TO YOUR
[1:09:59] REASON. HE SAID IF YOU DO THEN YOU WILL
[1:10:02] CONFINE YOURSELF TO REASON. IS it okay?
[1:10:05] &gt;&gt; I say something.
[1:10:06] &gt;&gt; OKAY. HE SAID NOW THERE'S TRY DON'T TRY
[1:10:08] TO REASON IT. YOU SAY NOW LET ME SEE.
[1:10:10] Maybe I do this. Don't reason IT BELIEVE
[1:10:13] GOD. HE SAID GOD DOESN'T COME BY REASON.
[1:10:16] HE SAID YOU KNOW GOD BY SIMPLE CHILDLIKE
[1:10:18] FAITH TO ACCEPT HIS WORD. HE SAID NOW
[1:10:22] LISTEN your reason power within yourself
[1:10:24] but FAITH IT COMES FROM GOD. HE SAID
[1:10:28] FAITH IS SOMETHING THAT'S BORN IN YOU.
[1:10:30] IT'S SOMETHING THAT GOD GIVES YOU. AMEN.
[1:10:33] NOW WATCH THIS. THEN THAT SON OF GOD
[1:10:35] STANDS THERE. AMEN. KNOWING where he's
[1:10:37] AT AND ALL THE DEVILS IN HELL COULD NOT
[1:10:41] SHAKE HIM AWAY FROM IT. YOU COULD POINT
[1:10:43] A MACHINE GUN AT HIM AND YOU WILL NEVER
[1:10:46] BACK HIM OFF OF HIS CONVICTIONS. AMEN. I
[1:10:49] think it's amazing. AMEN. THAT THIS
[1:10:51] FAITH I'M SPEAKING OF, IT IS NOT EARNED,
[1:10:53] BUT IT IS A GIFT OF GOD TO YOU.
[1:10:57] &gt;&gt; PAUL SAID, "BY GRACE ARE YOU SAVED
[1:10:58] THROUGH FAITH AND THAT NOT OF
[1:11:00] YOURSELVES. It is the GIFT OF GOD." IN
[1:11:03] GALATIANS 2:16, KNOWING THAT A MAN IS
[1:11:06] NOT JUSTIFIED by the works of the law,
[1:11:08] Amen. But by the faith of Jesus CHRIST,
[1:11:10] I LOVE A PROPHET. HE'LL STOP RIGHT THERE
[1:11:13] AND HE'LL SAY, "NOW, AMEN." DID HE SAY,
[1:11:15] "CONTEND FOR THE FAITH THAT WAS
[1:11:16] DELIVERED to Israel." HE SAID, "NO." HE
[1:11:19] SAID, "CONTEND FOR THE FAITH THAT WAS
[1:11:21] DELIVERED TO THE SAINTS." HE SAID,
[1:11:23] "BECAUSE WHAT ISRAEL HAD WAS UNDER THE
[1:11:26] DISPENSATION OF LAW." HE SAID, "BUT WHAT
[1:11:28] WE'RE TO CONTEND FOR HAS COME UNTO US
[1:11:31] UNDER THE DISPENSATION OF GRACE." He
[1:11:34] said, "Now watch. We have believed in
[1:11:35] Jesus Christ that WE MIGHT BE
[1:11:37] JUSTIFIED." AMEN. NOT BY THE WORKS OF
[1:11:40] THE LAW, BUT BY THE FAITH OF CHRIST. FOR
[1:11:43] BY THE WORKS of the LAW SHALL NO FLESH
[1:11:46] BE JUSTIFIED. I LOVE WHAT PAUL SAYS IN
[1:11:49] PHILIPPIANS 3:9. AND BEING FOUND IN HIM,
[1:11:52] NOT HAVING MY OWN RIGHTEOUSNESS, which
[1:11:54] is of THE LAW, BUT THAT WHICH IS THROUGH
[1:11:57] THE FAITH OF CHRIST. AMEN. I WANT TO SAY
[1:12:00] THIS. YOU GOT A HEART IN YOU, RIGHT?
[1:12:02] AMEN. And in that heart, brother said,
[1:12:04] THERE IS A DOOR TO THE HEART, RIGHT? HE
[1:12:06] SAID, "BUT THEN THERE ARE DOORS IN THE
[1:12:08] DOOR,
[1:12:09] &gt;&gt; RIGHT?" HE'LL SAY THIS. HE SAID, "NOW,
[1:12:11] LET'S FIND THAT DOOR OF FAITH." HE SAID,
[1:12:13] "NOW, YOU'LL COME TO CHURCH AND YOU'LL
[1:12:15] WATCH SIGNS OF GOD AND WONDERS BE
[1:12:17] performed and you won't pay any
[1:12:19] attention TO THAT BECAUSE THE CREEDS HAS
[1:12:22] LOCKED THAT DOOR OF FAITH IN YOU AND
[1:12:25] WATCH AND MADE YOU THINK THAT THAT IS A
[1:12:27] FAITH." HE SAID, "AND THERE IS ONLY ONE
[1:12:30] FAITH AND THAT IS THE FAITH OF GOD. AND
[1:12:33] THE ONLY ONE CAN BRING THE faith of God
[1:12:35] is Jesus Christ, HIS SON, THAT COMES
[1:12:37] INTO YOUR HEART. LISTEN, HE'S KNOCKED AT
[1:12:40] YOUR door
[1:12:42] &gt;&gt; through signs, WONDERS, AND MIRACLES.
[1:12:45] BUT YOU'LL KEEP THAT ALL PINNED UP AND
[1:12:47] SAY, "I DON'T WANT NOTHING TO DO WITH
[1:12:48] THAT." OH, IF HE COULD ONLY STAND AND
[1:12:51] YOU WOULD OPEN up that door. It wouldn't
[1:12:53] BE TWO MINUTES. YOU WOULD BELIEVE EVERY
[1:12:56] WORD THE BIBLE WROTE AND SAY AMEN TO
[1:12:59] EVERY BIT OF IT IF YOU WOULD JUST OPEN
[1:13:01] UP THE DOOR AND LET JESUS COME IN AND
[1:13:04] GIVE YOU THE FAITH THAT HE HAS TO GIVE
[1:13:07] YOU. He said WHEN YOU TAKE CHRIST'S
[1:13:09] FAITH THEN YOU RECOGNIZE HIM. WHEN A MAN
[1:13:13] MARRIES A WOMAN, AMEN, THE BRIDE, AMEN,
[1:13:16] ACCEPTS ALL THAT THE BRIDEGROOM HAS. I
[1:13:19] WANT TO SAY THIS TO you today. Amen.
[1:13:21] That there was a first Adam. How many
[1:13:23] KNOWS THAT?
[1:13:25] AND THERE WAS A A FIRST EVE. AND AND AND
[1:13:27] I CAN SAY THIS TO YOU. AMEN. THROUGH A
[1:13:29] PROPHET'S TEACHING, WE NOW UNDERSTAND,
[1:13:32] AMEN, THAT THERE IS A SECOND ADAM and
[1:13:35] there is a second Eve. AND WE FIND OUT
[1:13:37] THAT THE FIRST ADAM AND EVE FAIL. BUT A
[1:13:40] PROPHET SAID THE SECOND ADAM AND EVE
[1:13:42] WILL NOT AND CANNOT FALL
[1:13:45] &gt;&gt; BECAUSE THEY ARE THE WORD.
[1:13:47] &gt;&gt; NOW WATCH WHAT HE'LL SAY, BROTHER ED.
[1:13:48] HE'LL SAY, "THEN WE ARE IN ANOTHER
[1:13:50] GARDEN of Eden." Amen.
[1:13:52] &gt;&gt; AND YOU KNOW WHAT HE SAYS? HE'LL SAY,
[1:13:54] "LOOK, FOR 6,000 YEARS, HE HAS TAKEN
[1:13:57] EVERYTHING HE can to PERVERT GOD, WHAT
[1:14:00] GOD MADE." HE SAID, "SEE, IT'S NOW
[1:14:02] SATAN'S EDEN." NOW, HOW MANY CAN AGREE,
[1:14:05] AMEN, THAT THE SECOND ADAM is Christ?
[1:14:08] That's in the Bible. 1 Corinthians 15,
[1:14:10] it is written, "The first man, Adam, WAS
[1:14:11] MADE A LIVING SOUL, BUT THE LAST ADAM
[1:14:14] was made a quickening spirit." Ver said,
[1:14:16] "NOW SEE THE SECOND ADAM," he said, the
[1:14:18] first Adam LOST HIS POWER. BUT WE ARE
[1:14:21] TAUGHT IN THE BIBLE, LISTEN, I LOVE
[1:14:23] THAT, brother Tom. WE ARE TAUGHT IN THE
[1:14:25] BIBLE THAT WHAT THE FIRST ADAM LOST,
[1:14:29] AMEN, THE SECOND ADAM, CHRIST RESTORED
[1:14:32] AGAIN TO THE HUMAN RACE. AMEN. THERE IS
[1:14:34] A PROPHET OF GOD, MALACHI FOR WHO'S NOT
[1:14:38] INTRODUCING A NEW FAITH. HE'S TELLING
[1:14:40] YOU WHAT I'M SAYING UNTO YOU IS WHAT THE
[1:14:43] FIRST ADAM LOST, BUT IT'S BEING RESTORED
[1:14:46] BY THE PREACHING OF THE GOSPEL OF JESUS
[1:14:48] CHRIST. AMEN. THEN IF THE FIRST ADAM IS
[1:14:51] CHRIST, THEN I CAN SAY TO YOU TODAY THE
[1:14:53] SECOND EVE IS THE BRIDE OF JESUS CHRIST.
[1:14:56] AND PAUL SAID THAT THIS BODY HAS A HEAD.
[1:14:59] AND HE SAYS THE BODY IS THE CHURCH. And
[1:15:02] he SAID NOW IN THE BODY OF HIS FLESH
[1:15:04] through death to present you holy,
[1:15:07] unblameable, unreprovable in his sight.
[1:15:10] He said now look THROUGH THIS LIFE OF
[1:15:12] HIS SON, his cross, the blood. It says
[1:15:15] THERE OF HIS CROSS THAT HE MIGHT
[1:15:17] RECONCILE TO HIMSELF A BODY WHICH IS A
[1:15:20] BRIDE WHICH IS EVE THE SECOND EVE AND
[1:15:24] GOD GIVE IT IN TYPE. HE SAID NOW THE
[1:15:26] SAME THING HE DID IN ADAM and Eve. Amen.
[1:15:28] Giving them a type THAT THEY WERE THE
[1:15:31] TYPE OF CHRIST AND THE BRIDE. He is the
[1:15:33] second Adam. I'm laying A I'M LAYING A
[1:15:35] POINT HERE. HE IS THE SECOND ADAM AND
[1:15:38] THE CHURCH is the second Eve. HE SAID,
[1:15:41] "AND AS LONG AS THE SECOND EVE, AMEN,
[1:15:44] COMPROMISES AGAINST THE WORD, ISN'T SHE
[1:15:46] DOING THE SAME THING THAT THE FIRST EVE
[1:15:50] DID?"
[1:15:52] &gt;&gt; NOW, BROTHER BRAND BRINGS IT DOWN PRETTY
[1:15:53] CLEAR, DON'T HE? HE SAID, "NOW, THE
[1:15:55] CONGREGATION SAY AMEN." HE SAID, TRYING
[1:15:57] to say, "Well, it was for SOME OTHER
[1:15:58] AGE." HOW CAN IT BE ANOTHER AGE WHEN HE
[1:16:01] is the same yesterday, TODAY, AND
[1:16:04] FOREVER? HE SAID, "NOW, WATCH THIS. GOD
[1:16:07] PURPOSED THAT BUT HE HID IT FROM THE
[1:16:09] EYES OF THE WISE AND PRUDENT AND HE
[1:16:11] WOULD REVEAL IT UNTO THE BABES. NOW
[1:16:14] WATCH THIS SUCH AS WOULD LEARN SAID IT
[1:16:17] BEAUTIFUL. He said who were
[1:16:19] predestinated TO RECEIVE IT. MY THEN WE
[1:16:23] CAN SAY NOW AMEN YOU CAN SEE WHY THIS
[1:16:26] END TIME MESSAGE IS REJECTED BECAUSE
[1:16:29] IT'S NOT ANOTHER DENOMINATION. BROTHER
[1:16:31] DAVID PAUL IT'S THE REVELATION OF GOD'S
[1:16:34] MYSTERY. AMEN. GOD IS NOT KNOWN BY
[1:16:37] DENOMINATION SAINTS. HE IS KNOWN BY
[1:16:40] REVELATION. HE SAID LOOK GOD IN HIS BODY
[1:16:43] CHRIST AND CHRIST IN HIS BODY THE BRIDE.
[1:16:46] HE SAID GOD MADE MANIFEST IN CHRIST.
[1:16:48] THEN CHRIST IS MADE MANIFEST IN THE
[1:16:51] BRIDE. AND AS GOD TOOK FROM THE BODY OF
[1:16:53] ADAM THE WOMAN AND SHE FELL. THEN GOD
[1:16:56] HAS TOOK FROM THE BODY OF CHRIST HIS
[1:16:58] FLESH HIS BODY WHICH IS HIS WORD.
[1:17:01] LISTEN. and is bringing A BRIDE OUT THAT
[1:17:03] WON'T FALL BY DENOMINATION OR CREED.
[1:17:06] WELL, IF I WAS A DEVIL, I'D BE AGAIN
[1:17:09] YOU, TOO. IF I WAS A DEVIL, I WILL DO
[1:17:12] EVERYTHING I COULD TO KEEP YOU
[1:17:13] DISCOURAGED AND KEEP YOU DEPRESSED AND
[1:17:16] KEEP YOU UNDER CONDEMNATION BECAUSE YOU
[1:17:18] ARE UNDERNEATH A PROPHECY AND HEAVENS
[1:17:21] AND EARTH WILL PASS AWAY. BUT THE
[1:17:23] PROPHECY OF THE WORD OF GOD SHALL NEVER
[1:17:26] FAIL. THERE WILL BE A BRIDE AND SHE WILL
[1:17:29] NOT FALL. SHE WON'T FALL BY CREED. SHE
[1:17:32] WON'T FALL BY DENOMINATION. HE SAID,
[1:17:34] "NO, SHE IS the second Eve." HALLELUJAH.
[1:17:38] SHE IS NOT BREAKING AND SPOOLING HER
[1:17:40] SKIRTS OF PURITY AND HOLINESS TO HER
[1:17:43] HUSBAND. SHE WILL STAY with his word
[1:17:48] &gt;&gt; REGARDLESS OF WHAT ANYBODY SAYS. YOU CAN
[1:17:50] HAVE ALL THE ECUMENICAL moves you WANT
[1:17:52] TO AND ALL THE AFFILIATIONS AND SHE WILL
[1:17:55] NEVER LEAVE THE WORD.
[1:17:58] I LOVE THIS IN THE MASTERPIECE. HE SAID,
[1:18:00] "THE SECOND Adam and the second Eve,
[1:18:03] BROTHER JOE, THEY ARE NOW READY FOR THE
[1:18:06] GARDEN, THE MILLENNIUM BACK ON THE
[1:18:08] EARTH." YOU KNOW WHAT HE CALLED THIS
[1:18:10] SECOND ADAM AND THIS SECOND EVE? HE
[1:18:12] CALLED HER THE MASTERPIECE FAMILY. AND
[1:18:15] HE SAID, "AND NOW THE MASTERPIECE FAMILY
[1:18:18] HAS COME AGAIN. IT'S CHRIST AND HIS
[1:18:20] BRIDE READY TO COME. THE SECOND ADAM,
[1:18:23] THE SECOND EVE ARE NOW READY TO RETURN
[1:18:26] BACK TO THEIR HOME." AND THE WHOLE
[1:18:28] PICTURE HAS BEEN REDEMPTION FROM WHERE
[1:18:31] IT WAS, BRINGING IT BACK JUST EXACTLY
[1:18:35] LIKE IT WAS. OH CHURCH OF THE LIVING
[1:18:37] GOD, WHAT WAS IS NOT A MYSTERY. IT'S NOT
[1:18:41] A HISTORY. IT'S A REALITY. IT'S A
[1:18:44] REVELATION. LISTEN, I'M NOT CONTENDING
[1:18:46] FOR A BUNCH OF HYBRIDIZED THEOLOGICAL
[1:18:49] PERVERSIONS OF THE MOST SACRED BOOK THAT
[1:18:52] HAS EVER BEEN PUT INTO WRITING. I AM
[1:18:54] CONTENDING THAT THIS IS GOD'S WORD. I AM
[1:18:57] CONTENDING THAT IT IS MOVED OFF OF THE
[1:18:59] PAPER INTO THE FLESH OF THE BRIDE OF
[1:19:01] JESUS CHRIST. HALLELUJAH. I AM
[1:19:04] CONTENDING THAT WE ARE NOT ANOTHER
[1:19:06] CHURCH. WE ARE THE MANY MEMBERED BODY OF
[1:19:09] JESUS CHRIST. I AM CONTENDING WE ARE NOT
[1:19:12] UNDER THE HEADSHIP OF A MAN. WE'RE UNDER
[1:19:14] THE HEADSHIP OF THE WORD. I AM
[1:19:16] CONTENDING THAT THERE WILL BE MIRACLES.
[1:19:18] THERE WILL BE SIGNS. THERE WILL be
[1:19:20] wonders. THERE WILL BE HOLY GHOST
[1:19:22] MANIFESTATION. THERE WILL BE SOULS
[1:19:24] SAVED. THERE WILL BE SHACKLES BROKE.
[1:19:27] THERE WILL BE DEAD RAISED. THERE WILL BE
[1:19:29] SICK HEALED. THERE WILL BE HOMES
[1:19:30] RESTORED. THERE WILL BE LIVES
[1:19:32] TRANSFORMED. I AM CONTENDING upon the
[1:19:35] convictions of the revelation of the
[1:19:38] word of God.
[1:19:40] &gt;&gt; IN THE AGE I'M LIVING IN. AMEN. I can
[1:19:43] tell you today a prophet God said the
[1:19:45] fall in the garden did a lot to man,
[1:19:47] didn't it?
[1:19:48] &gt;&gt; You know what IT DONE? IT CAUSED MAN TO
[1:19:52] BECOME conscious to the fact he was made
[1:19:55] superior
[1:19:57] over everything. Are you with me?
[1:20:00] &gt;&gt; And inferior to nothing.
[1:20:04] Now think about that. Superior over
[1:20:07] everything.
[1:20:09] Inferior to nothing.
[1:20:12] [gasps]
[1:20:12] &gt;&gt; YOU HAVE BEEN GIVEN dominion
[1:20:15] &gt;&gt; over the foul of the air,
[1:20:17] &gt;&gt; over the fish OF THE SEA.
[1:20:20] OVER EVERYTHING THAT LAYS OR CREEPS UPON
[1:20:23] THE EARTH.
[1:20:24] &gt;&gt; YOU HAVE BEEN GIVEN DOMINION. NOW WHEN
[1:20:26] GOD MADE MAN SUPERIOR to everything on
[1:20:28] the earth, HE SAYS THAT POWER WAS
[1:20:31] OPERATED BY A LAW. RIGHT? AND HE SAID
[1:20:34] NOW WHAT WAS THAT LAW? IT WAS THE LAW OF
[1:20:36] FAITH.
[1:20:37] &gt;&gt; NOW WATCH IN GENESIS 3 WHEN THE SERPENT
[1:20:40] MADE HIS ATTACK BROTHER BEN IS POWERFUL.
[1:20:43] HIS ATTACK WAS ON THE FAITH OF GOD. WHEN
[1:20:47] THE SERPENT ATTACKED EVE, HE WAS
[1:20:49] ATTACKING THE FAITH OF GOD BY PRESENTING
[1:20:51] WISDOM. SO THE FALL IN THE GARDEN WAS
[1:20:55] THE BEGINNING OF THE contest between
[1:20:57] WISDOM AND FAITH OR AS WE KNOW WISDOM
[1:21:00] VERSUS FAITH. NOW LET ME SAY this to
[1:21:02] you. Amen. Serpent attacked the
[1:21:05] simplicity OF THE FAITH OF GOD. LOOK HOW
[1:21:08] SIMPLE IT WAS, BROTHER JARED. IF THE
[1:21:10] WIND WAS TOO HIGH, THE LAW OF GOD IN
[1:21:13] ADAM COULD SPEAK AND SAY, "NOW CALM
[1:21:15] DOWN, WIND. IF THERE WAS A TREE AND
[1:21:18] SISTER NISH, IT WAS WHERE YOU ARE AND
[1:21:20] EVE LOOKED OVER AT ADAM AND SAID, "AND I
[1:21:22] KNOW YOU WIVES would never do this.
[1:21:23] Won't anything change in the front
[1:21:24] yard?" But but [laughter]
[1:21:26] if HE LOOKED OVER THERE AND SAID, "YOU
[1:21:27] KNOW, I'D REALLY LIKE TO HAVE THAT TREE
[1:21:29] OVER THERE IN THAT CORNER OF THE
[1:21:30] GARDEN." ALL HE HAD TO DO WAS SAY,
[1:21:32] "TREE, GET UP AND MOVE."
[1:21:35] &gt;&gt; NOW, come on. You You brothers know what
[1:21:37] I'm talking about. Amen. When you were I
[1:21:39] remember when I was dating my wife.
[1:21:41] Amen. I was just a country boy. I didn't
[1:21:43] know any better. And I pulled up and I I
[1:21:46] gonna tell everything, but I pulled up
[1:21:48] and you KNOW, I HAD THIS I HAD THIS OLD
[1:21:50] 99 FORD F350. Thought it was the
[1:21:52] greatest thing ever made, Carter. I
[1:21:54] mean, it was a big truck DY. I mean, I
[1:21:55] SURPRISED THAT THING. I PULLED UP TO
[1:21:57] pick her up at school ONE DAY AND I
[1:21:59] TURNED in there. I was going to pull up
[1:22:00] and pick her up. Had them camo I'm
[1:22:02] showing how country I am. Had them camo
[1:22:04] rain guards and camo door cover. AND
[1:22:06] BROTHER WESLEY, I PULLED IN THERE IN
[1:22:08] FRONT OF THIS GREAT OLD BIG SCHOOL and I
[1:22:10] GOT STUCK RIGHT THERE IN THE TRAFFIC
[1:22:12] LINE CUZ THAT DOULY WOULDN'T FIT THROUGH
[1:22:14] THERE. BUT BUT I WAS REALLY WHAT YOU'RE
[1:22:16] TRYING TO DO IS YOU'RE TRYING TO DATE,
[1:22:18] RIGHT? YOU'RE TRYING TO IMPRESS HER, YOU
[1:22:20] KNOW? AMEN. LET ME GO GET THE car for
[1:22:22] you. Let me OPEN THE DOOR. COME ON. ADAM
[1:22:24] HAD US ALL BEAT.
[1:22:26] &gt;&gt; COME ON. HE HAD US ALL BEAT. AMEN. ALL
[1:22:29] HE HAD TO DO WAS SPEAK AND WHAT SHE
[1:22:31] WANTED WOULD APPEAR.
[1:22:32] &gt;&gt; NOW, NOW WATCH THIS. BUT THE SERPENT
[1:22:35] COME IN AND BEGIN TO ATTACK THAT
[1:22:37] AUTHORITY BY OFFERING WISDOM. AND
[1:22:39] BROTHER SAID, "WHAT IS SATAN'S WEAPON
[1:22:41] AGAINST YOU IS TO TRY TO GET YOU TO
[1:22:44] DISBELIEVE YOUR WEAPON. HE DISARMS YOU."
[1:22:47] HE SAID, "IF HE CAN GET YOU TO BELIEVE
[1:22:49] THAT YOUR WEAPON IS EQUIVALENT, IF HE
[1:22:52] GETS YOU TO BELIEVE YOUR WEAPON IS NOT
[1:22:53] STRONG ENOUGH, HE HAS DISARMED YOU." OH,
[1:22:56] BROTHER NEVILLE, I HOPE WE NEVER LEAVE
[1:22:58] THAT. He said, "LOOK, HE'S DISARMED YOU
[1:23:01] WHEN he gets YOU TO BELIEVE YOUR
[1:23:03] DISBELIEVE YOUR WEAPON." SO, ADAM'S
[1:23:05] WEAPON WAS THE AUTHORITY OF THE FAITH OF
[1:23:09] GOD OPERATING THROUGH HIS LIFE. LOOK
[1:23:11] WHAT HE SAYS. WHEN YOU LAY THAT DOWN,
[1:23:14] WHEN YOU LAY YOUR WEAPON DOWN, THAT
[1:23:16] FINISHES YOUR FIGHT. HE SAID, "WHAT
[1:23:18] HAPPENS? YOU ARE DONE." NOW WATCH A
[1:23:21] PROPHET. HE SAYS, "HOLD YOUR WEAPON."
[1:23:24] HOW MANY WILL RECEIVE THAT? HE SAYS,
[1:23:26] "HOLD YOUR WEAPON. DON'T YOU LAY IT
[1:23:29] DOWN." COME ON, CHURCH. THE DEVIL DON'T
[1:23:31] HAVE TO SHOOT YOU AND THEN TAKE YOUR
[1:23:33] ARMOR AWAY OR WEAPON TO DISARM YOU. IF
[1:23:36] HE CAN JUST GET IN YOUR MIND AND GET YOU
[1:23:38] TO BELIEVE THE MESSAGE IS NOT ENOUGH AND
[1:23:41] THE HOLY GHOST YOU HAVE IS NOT ENOUGH
[1:23:43] AND THE SALVATION OF YOUR SOUL IS NOT
[1:23:46] ENOUGH. THE VERY MINUTE YOU BEGIN TO
[1:23:48] THINK THOSE OLD DEMON THOUGHTS IS THE
[1:23:50] VERY MINUTE THAT DEVIL BEGINS TO DISARM
[1:23:53] YOU. BUT I THINK IT'S HIGH TIME FOR THE
[1:23:55] BRIDE OF JESUS CHRIST TO GET HER WEAPON
[1:23:57] BACK IN HER HAND AND SAY THE THOUGHTS
[1:24:00] THAT I THINK ARE GOING TO BE PURE.
[1:24:02] THEY'RE GOING TO BE HOLY. THEY'RE GOING
[1:24:03] TO BE OF GOOD VALUE. THEY'RE GOING TO BE
[1:24:05] OF GOOD REPORT. I REFUSE TO BE A
[1:24:08] DISARMED CHRISTIAN.
[1:24:10] &gt;&gt; I TELL YOU, YOU SAY, "WHAT ARE YOU
[1:24:12] SAYING, PREACHER?" I'M SAYING, "CONTEND
[1:24:14] FOR YOUR WEAPON."
[1:24:15] &gt;&gt; ARE YOU HEARING ME? I'M SAYING, "CONTEND
[1:24:17] FOR YOUR WEAPON. CONTEND FOR THIS
[1:24:20] MESSAGE. CONTEND FOR THE HOLY GHOST.
[1:24:22] CONTEND FOR THE REALITY OF JESUS
[1:24:24] CHRIST." NOW, look what THE BIBLE SAYS
[1:24:26] IN GENESIS 3:1. Is this okay? IT SAYS,
[1:24:29] "NOW THE SERPENT
[1:24:32] WAS MORE SUBTLE THAN ANY BEAST OF THE
[1:24:34] FIELD WHICH THE LORD GOD HAD MADE." NOW
[1:24:37] WATCH THIS WORD SUBTLE. IT MEANS SHREWD,
[1:24:41] &gt;&gt; CRAFTY, SLY, SENSIBLE, PRUDENT. Now look
[1:24:46] WHAT IT SAYS IN GENESIS 3:6. AND THE
[1:24:49] WOMAN SAW THAT THE TREE WAS GOOD FOR
[1:24:50] food
[1:24:52] and THAT IT WAS PLEASANT TO THE EYE AND
[1:24:55] WAS A TREE TO BE DESIRED. NOW WATCH
[1:24:57] THIS. TO MAKE ONE WISE.
[1:25:01] &gt;&gt; She took of the fruit thereof and did
[1:25:04] eat AND GAVE ALSO UNTO HER HUSBAND WITH
[1:25:06] HER and he did eat. Now look at this
[1:25:08] word wise. It means to be PRUDENT TO BE
[1:25:12] WISELY UNDERSTAND. LISTEN, IT MEANS TO
[1:25:15] HAVE SUCCESS. BROTHER JARED, WHEN THE
[1:25:18] SERPENT COME TO EVE, NOW NOW COME ON
[1:25:21] FOLKS. SHE WAS MARRIED TO THE TO THE TO
[1:25:24] THE TO THE CREATION OF GOD. SHE WAS
[1:25:27] MARRIED TO GOD IN FLESH. SHE LET ME BACK
[1:25:30] UP AND SAY THIS. SHE WAS MARRIED TO THE
[1:25:32] SPOKEN WORD OF GOD. ADAM CREATED, RIGHT?
[1:25:35] BUT THEN THIS SERPENT COME AND WATCH
[1:25:36] WHAT HE DONE. HE BEGAN TO SAY, "NOW, IF
[1:25:38] YOU'LL LEAVE THAT
[1:25:40] &gt;&gt; AND YOU'LL COME WITH ME, YOU'LL BE MORE
[1:25:42] SUCCESSFUL." I JUST PICKED UP SOMETHING
[1:25:44] AND I'M going to PREACH A SECOND. HOW
[1:25:46] MANY HOMES HAVE BEEN WRECKED?
[1:25:49] &gt;&gt; And you know, I'm not a politician. I'M
[1:25:51] A PREACHER. HOW MANY HOMES HAVE BEEN
[1:25:52] WRECKED BECAUSE WOMEN GOT THEIR EYES ON
[1:25:55] OTHER MEN?
[1:25:57] &gt;&gt; COME ON. AND A SPIRIT COME IN AND SAID,
[1:26:00] "NOW, IF YOU'LL LEAVE THAT, IF YOU'LL
[1:26:01] LEAVE YOUR HUSBAND AND COME OVER HERE
[1:26:03] WITH ME, I'LL TELL YOU WHAT THAT IS.
[1:26:05] THAT'S A DEVIL." AND I'LL TELL YOU WHAT
[1:26:07] IT DID. IT DIDN'T START 10 YEARS AGO. IT
[1:26:09] STARTED ALL THE WAY BACK IN THE GARDEN
[1:26:10] OF EDEN WHEN THE SERPENT TOLD EVE, "IF
[1:26:13] YOU'LL JUST COME AWAY FROM ADAM, IF
[1:26:15] YOU'LL JUST GET AWAY FROM THAT WORD,
[1:26:17] I'LL MAKE YOU SO SUCCESSFUL." YOU KNOW
[1:26:18] WHAT THE PROPHET GOD SAID? HE SAID,
[1:26:20] "RAFAIR THE SERPENT PERVERTED THE THIRST
[1:26:23] OF SUCCESS IN THE SOUL OF HUMANITY." YOU
[1:26:26] KNOW WHAT HE SAID? HE SAID, "IN OTHER
[1:26:28] WORDS, YOU WANT TO REALLY BE RIGHT WITH
[1:26:30] GOD, TAKE MY ADVICE." LISTEN TO ME. GOD
[1:26:33] DON'T MEAN THAT. REB SAID THAT IS THE
[1:26:35] HISS OF THE SERPENT. HE SAID THE WOMAN
[1:26:38] SAW THAT THE TREE WAS GOOD FOR FOOD. Now
[1:26:41] listen to a prophet. Now this is THIS IS
[1:26:43] POWERFUL. HE SAID, "SEE WHAT IT WAS? HIS
[1:26:46] REASONINGS BROUGHT HER TO know that it
[1:26:49] was right.
[1:26:50] &gt;&gt; That's right. [gasps]
[1:26:52] &gt;&gt; IT WAS TRUE. BROTHER DAVID, THAT MAKES
[1:26:54] ME WANT TO STOP AND PREACH FOR TWO
[1:26:56] HOURS. THE SERPENT'S REASONING HAD THE
[1:26:59] ABILITY TO AFFECT EVE ENOUGH. IT WASN'T
[1:27:03] TRUE.
[1:27:05] &gt;&gt; BUT WHAT HE WAS PRESENTING, HE HAD
[1:27:08] ENOUGH REASONING BEHIND IT THAT HE COULD
[1:27:10] ACTUALLY MAKE IT TRUTH TO HER. CAN I
[1:27:11] TELL YOU SOMETHING? SOMETIMES YOU
[1:27:13] BELIEVE THINGS THAT AIN'T REALLY TRUE,
[1:27:14] but they're true to you.
[1:27:17] &gt;&gt; COME ON. YOU YOU GET IN YOUR MIND,
[1:27:19] EVERYBODY'S AGAINST YOU, AND THAT AIN'T
[1:27:21] THE TRUTH. BUT THE DEMON OF REASONING
[1:27:24] HAS SO PERVERTED THE AFFECTION IN YOUR
[1:27:27] SOUL THAT EVERYBODY'S AGAINST YOU.
[1:27:29] NOBODY LOVES YOU. AMEN. WHY DON'T WE
[1:27:31] JUST TAKE THE GLOVES OFF OF THIS MORNING
[1:27:33] AND SAY, "I AM THE SECOND EVE. I AM NOT
[1:27:36] THE FIRST EVE. I REFUSE TO LISTEN TO THE
[1:27:39] HISS OF THE SERPENT AND ALLOW THE DEVIL
[1:27:42] TO BEGIN TO PERVERT THINGS IN MY MIND
[1:27:45] AND PARALYZE MY FAITH.
[1:27:48] &gt;&gt; NOW, BROTHER, THAT BREAKS IT ON DOWN. HE
[1:27:50] SAID, "SATAN is presenting knowledge.
[1:27:52] KNOWLEDGE THAT WAS CONTRARY TO the
[1:27:54] word."
[1:27:55] &gt;&gt; Oh, God.
[1:27:57] &gt;&gt; So, SO IF YOU'RE GOING TO TAKE ADVICE,
[1:27:59] MAKE SURE IT'S COMING from the word.
[1:28:01] [gasps]
[1:28:02] [sighs]
[1:28:03] &gt;&gt; Can we preach?
[1:28:05] YOU DON'T TAKE FINANCIAL ADVICE FROM
[1:28:07] YOUR BROKE UNCLE.
[1:28:13] &gt;&gt; Brother David, it's good to have you
[1:28:14] back up here this morning. You got my
[1:28:16] back.
[1:28:18] &gt;&gt; AMEN. YOU DON'T GO TAKE ADVICE FROM YOUR
[1:28:20] BROKE UNCLE ABOUT HOW TO BUILD A
[1:28:22] SUCCESSFUL BUSINESS.
[1:28:23] &gt;&gt; AMEN. MAKE SURE THE ADVICE YOU'RE
[1:28:25] GETTING IS COMING FROM A PURE SOURCE.
[1:28:28] WELL, I MIGHT AS WELL SAY IT. AMEN. AND
[1:28:30] MAKE SURE YOUR ADVICE, AMEN, THAT YOU'RE
[1:28:32] GETTING FOR YOUR HOME IS COMING FROM THE
[1:28:34] WORD OF GOD AND IT'S NOT UNDER THE H OF
[1:28:37] THE SERPENT.
[1:28:39] &gt;&gt; LISTEN TO MAKE ONE WISE. NOW WATCH THIS.
[1:28:41] AND THEY KNEW THEY WERE NAKED. NOW
[1:28:43] BROTHER SAID IT BEAUTIFUL. HE SAID
[1:28:44] THERE'S ONLY TWO SOURCES WE DRAW OUR
[1:28:46] LIFE FROM. He said there's ONE WISDOM
[1:28:48] AND THE OTHER IS FAITH. HE SAID NOW YOU
[1:28:50] WILL SEE WHAT WISDOM PRODUCES AND THEN
[1:28:52] YOU WILL SEE WHAT FAITH PRODUCES. HE
[1:28:54] SAID, "BRING THEM UP OUT OF THE BIBLE
[1:28:56] AND SHOW WHAT THEY ARE, WHAT THEY'RE
[1:28:58] GOING TO DO, AND WHAT THEY HAVE DONE."
[1:29:00] SO, WISDOM WILL DO SOMETHING. IT'LL SHOW
[1:29:03] YOU IT. IT'LL WHEN YOU BEGIN TO LOOK AT
[1:29:05] WISDOM FROM THE BIBLE, YOU WILL BEGIN TO
[1:29:07] SEE WHAT IT WAS, WHAT IT'S DOING, AND
[1:29:09] WHAT IT'S GOING TO DO. YOU CAN LOOK AT
[1:29:11] FAITH AND SEE WHAT IT DONE, WHAT IT'S
[1:29:13] DOING, AND WHAT IT'S GOING TO DO. NOW, I
[1:29:15] LOVE THIS. ARE YOU WITH ME? IN GENESIS
[1:29:17] 1, THE BIBLE SAYS THIS, THAT FAITH AND
[1:29:21] WISDOM WAS BOTH INTRODUCED. RIGHT? IN
[1:29:23] THE BEGINNING, GOD CREATED HIM SAID,
[1:29:25] "SEE, GOD WAS THE AUTHOR OF FAITH." HE
[1:29:28] SAID, "AND SATAN IS THE AUTHOR OF
[1:29:30] WISDOM. HE'S TRYING TO GET THE PEOPLE TO
[1:29:33] ACCEPT HIS WISDOM." NOW, LISTEN TO THIS.
[1:29:36] AND PULL THEM AWAY FROM THE FAITH.
[1:29:40] &gt;&gt; NOW, ARE YOU ARE YOU FOLLOWING ME? THE
[1:29:42] SERPENT IS STILL AROUND, FOLKS. AND HE'S
[1:29:45] TRYING TO PULL THE PEOPLE AWAY FROM THE
[1:29:48] FAITH. GENESIS 3 WAS THE BEGINNING OF
[1:29:50] THE CONTEST BETWEEN WISDOM AND FAITH.
[1:29:53] NOW WATCH THIS. OUR WISDOM DOES NOT COME
[1:29:55] FROM SATAN.
[1:29:58] &gt;&gt; Brother Ram SAID, LOOK, HE SAID THE
[1:30:00] EARTHLY WISDOM DOES, it was inherited
[1:30:02] FROM ME. AND NOW NOW, NOW CAN YOU TAKE A
[1:30:04] PROFIT?
[1:30:06] &gt;&gt; HE SAID, WHERE EVE SWAPPED OFF FAITH FOR
[1:30:09] WISDOM.
[1:30:11] &gt;&gt; MY GOODNESS. THEN I CAN BRING IT TO
[1:30:13] TODAY AND I CAN SAY, "BROTHER BRIAN, WE
[1:30:16] ARE IN THE FINAL CONTEST. I BELIEVE WE
[1:30:18] ARE IN THE FINAL ROUNDS OF THE GREAT
[1:30:21] CONTEST BETWEEN WISDOM AND FAITH." NOW,
[1:30:23] I WANT YOU TO WATCH THIS BECAUSE IN
[1:30:25] GENESIS 3, IT ACTUALLY PARALLELS WITH 2
[1:30:29] CORINTHIANS 11. AFTER THE FALL IN THE
[1:30:32] GARDEN, THE WOMAN RECEIVES HER OWN
[1:30:35] IDENTITY, WHICH IS APART FROM ADAM, AND
[1:30:38] SHE RECEIVES A NAME AND IS NAMED EVE.
[1:30:41] NOW, IF YOU IF YOU LIKE TO STUDY YOUR
[1:30:42] BIBLES, ARE YOU WITH ME?
[1:30:44] &gt;&gt; IF YOU LIKE TO STUDY YOUR BIBLES, YOU
[1:30:47] CAN RUN A CHAIN ON THE NAME EVE. OKAY?
[1:30:50] AND YOU'LL FIRST READ IT RIGHT THERE IN
[1:30:52] GENESIS 3:20. AND ADAM CALLED HIS WIFE'S
[1:30:56] NAME EVE [snorts] BECAUSE SHE WAS THE
[1:30:59] MOTHER OF ALL LIVING. THE SECOND TIME
[1:31:02] YOU read the name Eve IS IN GENESIS 4:1.
[1:31:05] AND IT SAYS, "ADAM KNEW EVE, HIS WIFE."
[1:31:08] NOW LISTEN FROM GENESIS 4, EVE IS NOT
[1:31:11] MENTIONED AGAIN UNTIL 2 CORINTHIANS 11
[1:31:14] WHEN PAUL IS MOVED TO WRITE A WARNING OF
[1:31:18] WHAT HAPPENED IN THE NATURAL IS GOING TO
[1:31:21] HAPPEN IN THE SPIRITUAL. AND IN 2
[1:31:22] CORINTHIANS 11:3 HE SAYS, "AS THE
[1:31:25] SERPENT BEGOUT EVE THROUGH HER SUBILITY,
[1:31:29] SO YOUR MINDS SHOULD BE CORRUPTED FROM
[1:31:32] THE SIMPLICITY THAT'S IN CHRIST." LOOK
[1:31:35] AT THIS WORD CORRUPTED. IT MEANS TO LEAD
[1:31:37] AWAY A CHRISTIAN CHURCH FROM THE STATE
[1:31:40] OF KNOWLEDGE AND HOLINESS IN WHICH IT
[1:31:43] OUGHT TO ABIDE, TO PERISH, TO CORRUPT,
[1:31:47] TO DEFILE, TO DESTROY. COME ON, CHURCH.
[1:31:50] AMEN. THE MIND IS THE WOMB OF THE
[1:31:53] SPIRIT. THERE IS A WOMB OF THE PHYSICAL.
[1:31:56] THERE IS A WOMB OF THE SPIRIT. AND THE
[1:31:58] MIND IS THE WOMB TO THE SPIRIT. BURB
[1:32:02] SAID, "THAT'S HOW ADULTERY IS COMMITTED
[1:32:03] SPIRITUALLY IS WHEN YOU KNOW HIM
[1:32:05] BETTER." AMEN.
[1:32:07] &gt;&gt; BY THE WORD OF GOD, BUT BY THE INNER
[1:32:09] COURSE OF THE MIND, YOU TAKE IN A LIE OF
[1:32:12] THE DEVIL. NOW LISTEN, IT'S AGAINST THE
[1:32:14] WORD. LOOK HERE. AMEN. THE SAME WAY
[1:32:17] NATURAL ADULTERY IS COMMITTED, HE SAYS.
[1:32:20] AND WHEN THE BRIDE OF JESUS CHRIST LETS
[1:32:22] MAN-MADE CREEDS AND DOGMAS TAKE THE
[1:32:24] PLACE OF THE WORD, SHE IS COMMITTING
[1:32:27] ADULTERY. NOW WATCH, WHOSOEVER, NOW I'M
[1:32:30] IN THE BIBLE, AIN'T I? WHOSOEVER LOOKTH
[1:32:32] UPON A WOMAN TO LUST AFTER HER IN HIS
[1:32:35] HEART, HAS COMMITTED ADULTERY WITH HER
[1:32:38] ALREADY, NEVER LAID A HAND ON HER, NEVER
[1:32:40] GOT PHYSICAL, BUT JUST WHAT ENTERED HIS
[1:32:43] MIND. OH, GOD BRINGS A SPIRIT OF
[1:32:46] ADULTERY UPON THAT HEART. SAID, "WELL,
[1:32:49] THAT'S THE SAME THING IN THE SPIRITUAL.
[1:32:51] YOU LET IT COME INTO YOUR MIND."
[1:32:53] &gt;&gt; WELL, I MIGHT AS WELL PREACH. I'M HOME.
[1:32:55] AMEN. WHAT ARE WE LETTING COME INTO OUR
[1:32:57] MIND? IT'S AFFECTING OUR FELLOWSHIP.
[1:32:59] IT'S AFFECTING THE WAY WE SPEAK TO
[1:33:01] PEOPLE. IT'S AFFECTING THE WAY WE ACT.
[1:33:04] &gt;&gt; WELL, GLORY TO GOD. I SAY IT'S TIME TO
[1:33:06] SAY, "HOLY GHOST, BAPTIZE MY MIND. CLEAN
[1:33:09] OUT THE CHANNELS of my heart."
[1:33:13] BECAUSE WHATEVER IS IN THAT WOMB IS WHAT
[1:33:15] YOU'RE GOING TO BRING FORTH. COME ON,
[1:33:17] CHURCH. AMEN. WE JUST DEDICATED OUR
[1:33:19] BABY. THAT IS A PRODUCT OF WHAT COME OUT
[1:33:21] OF THE WOMB. AND WHATEVER YOU'RE
[1:33:23] MANIFESTING IN THE SPIRIT WORLD IS A
[1:33:26] PRODUCT OF WHAT YOU'RE ALLOWING TO COME
[1:33:29] INTO YOUR MIND.
[1:33:31] &gt;&gt; NOW, brother said through his bride,
[1:33:33] through the word, he's going to bring up
[1:33:35] the millennium. Now, I want to say
[1:33:36] something to you. Satan was able by
[1:33:38] wisdom and reasoning
[1:33:40] to begile EVE AND DRAW THE HUMAN RACE
[1:33:44] away from the living faith to live by
[1:33:48] knowledge,
[1:33:50] right?
[1:33:51] wisdom and reason. Now I want to say
[1:33:54] this to you. There is a wisdom of God.
[1:33:55] Bre said there's a wisdom from above.
[1:33:57] It's first pure. It's peaceable, gentle.
[1:33:59] This is the Bible. Each of being treated
[1:34:01] full of mercy and good fruit without
[1:34:03] partiality. Now watch this. And the
[1:34:06] wisdom that is from above is without
[1:34:08] hypocrisy.
[1:34:10] &gt;&gt; Isn't that powerful? BROTHER SAID, "NOW
[1:34:12] WATCH." HE SAID, "THERE IS A WISDOM OF
[1:34:14] GOD AND HERE IT IS. STAY WITH HIS WORD.
[1:34:19] BUT SATAN IN HIS WISDOM IS TRIED TO
[1:34:21] TWIST THE WORD SO THAT THE WISDOM I'M
[1:34:24] SPEAKING OF, HE SAID, "NOW LISTEN, THIS
[1:34:26] IS POWERFUL. THERE IS A CERTAIN AMOUNT
[1:34:28] OF FAITH THAT GOES WITH SATAN. IN ORDER
[1:34:32] TO ACCEPT SATAN, YOU GOT TO BELIEVE
[1:34:34] SATAN.
[1:34:36] &gt;&gt; Church of the living God, I'm trying to
[1:34:38] behave, but I'm feeling pretty good
[1:34:40] where Wesley TO ACCEPT SATAN, YOU GOT TO
[1:34:43] BELIEVE SATAN. AND THERE IS A PERVERTED
[1:34:45] FAITH TO A PERVERTED THING. DO YOU NOT
[1:34:48] SEE THE HISS OF THE SERPENT? AMEN. HOW
[1:34:50] DO YOU ACCEPT JESUS CHRIST? YOU BELIEVE
[1:34:53] ON HIM AND THEN YOU BRING FORTH OUT OF
[1:34:56] YOUR SPIRITUAL WOMB WHAT YOU'VE ACCEPTED
[1:34:58] FROM HIM. Oh my. HE SAID, "NOW WATCH ALL
[1:35:02] SATAN AND HIS POWER, HE'S GOT IS A
[1:35:04] PERVERTED POWER." HE SAID, "NOW WE'RE
[1:35:06] GOING TO REFER TO IT AS WISDOM BECAUSE
[1:35:08] IT'S NOT SATAN'S FAITH." HE SAID,
[1:35:10] "WATCH." NOW, NOW DO YOU KNOW WHAT THE
[1:35:12] PROPHET SAID? HE SAID, "A LIE IS ONLY
[1:35:14] THE TRUTH MISTOLD.
[1:35:18] A LIE, BROTHER XAVIER, IS ONLY THE TRUTH
[1:35:21] MISTOLD. I'VE SAID IT BEFORE. YOU'VE
[1:35:23] HEARD ME SAY IT. DO YOU REALIZE A LIE
[1:35:25] GETS AROUND THE WORLD THREE TIMES BEFORE
[1:35:27] THE truth ever gets its boots on?
[1:35:31] &gt;&gt; Oh, God. AMEN. NOW, WATCH THIS. SO, EVE
[1:35:34] HAD TO DENY GOD'S WORD BEFORE SHE COULD
[1:35:37] TAKE IN SATAN'S LIE.
[1:35:39] &gt;&gt; NOW, WATCH THIS. AND PAUL IS WRITING TO
[1:35:43] TIMOTHY IN 1 TIMOTHY 4 AND HE USES THE
[1:35:46] SAME EVENT OF GENESIS 3 AND SAYS,"DO NOT
[1:35:50] GIVE HEED TO SEDUCING SPIRITS
[1:35:54] &gt;&gt; AND DOCTRINES OF DEVILS." LOOK AT THIS
[1:35:56] WORD, SEDUCING, DECEIVER,
[1:35:58] WONDERING, ROVING, MISLEADING, leading
[1:36:02] into error.
[1:36:05] &gt;&gt; My God,
[1:36:07] &gt;&gt; we got a pulse in here.
[1:36:10] OF AGABON,
[1:36:12] &gt;&gt; A
[1:36:13] &gt;&gt; AN IMPOSTOR, A CORRUPTOR.
[1:36:16] &gt;&gt; LOOK HERE. WHAT DO THEY DO? THEY SPEAK
[1:36:18] LIES IN HYPOCRISY, HAVING THEIR
[1:36:21] CONSCIENCE SEARED WITH A HOT IRON. NOW,
[1:36:24] DO YOU KNOW WHAT IT'S BEAUTIFUL WHAT A
[1:36:25] PROPHET SAYS? HE SAYS, "WHEN JUDE BEGAN
[1:36:27] TO WRITE IN JUDE 1, HE SAID HE WAS
[1:36:30] RIDING WITH A KNOWLEDGE OF WHAT THE
[1:36:32] SPIRIT SPOKE THROUGH PAUL IN 2 TIMOTHY
[1:36:35] 3:1 WHEN HE SAID THIS, KNOW ALSO IN
[1:36:37] WHERE THE LAST DAYS." ANOINTED ONES AT
[1:36:39] THE END TIME. BROTHER SAYS, STOP.
[1:36:41] UNDERLINE THAT. LAST DAYS, RIGHT? NOW,
[1:36:44] WATCH WHAT HE SAYS. THEY WILL HAVE A
[1:36:46] FORM OF GODLINESS,
[1:36:49] &gt;&gt; BUT WILL DENY THE POWER THEREOF. AND
[1:36:52] LOOK WHAT PAUL SAYS. HE SAYS FROM SUCH
[1:36:55] TURN AWAY.
[1:36:56] &gt;&gt; HE DON'T SAY EMBRACE IT. HE DON'T SAY
[1:36:58] FELLOWSHIP IT. HE DON'T SAY OPEN IT UP
[1:37:00] AND BRING IT INTO YOUR HOME. HE SAID
[1:37:02] TURN AWAY FROM IT. FOR THIS IS THE SORT
[1:37:05] OF THEY WHICH CREEP INTO HOUSES AND LEAD
[1:37:07] CAPTIVE silly women LADEN WITH SINS AND
[1:37:11] LED AWAY WITH DIVERS LUST. NOW WATCH
[1:37:13] THIS. EVER LEARNING BUT NEVER ABLE TO
[1:37:16] COME TO THE KNOWLEDGE OF THE TRUTH. HE
[1:37:19] SAID, NOW LISTEN, IT WAS THAT SAME GROUP
[1:37:21] OF FUNDAMENTALIST BELIEVERS THAT PUT
[1:37:23] JESUS CHRIST ON THE CROSS AND KILLED HIM
[1:37:25] BECAUSE HE HAD SIGNS AND WONDERS AND
[1:37:28] THEY DIDN'T BELIEVE IT. NOW LISTEN, THAT
[1:37:31] SAME SPIRIT LIVES AMONG THE church
[1:37:35] today.
[1:37:37] &gt;&gt; IT'S A RELIGIOUS PEOPLE. IT'S NOT A
[1:37:40] BUNCH OF INFIDELS. IT'S NOT A
[1:37:42] FUNDAMENTAL BUNCH. AMEN. NO, IT IS A
[1:37:44] fundamental bunch. He said, "PLACE IT
[1:37:45] RIGHT OUT THERE." AND THEY'RE EXACTLY
[1:37:47] RIGHT. OH CHURCH OF THE LIVING GOD, I'VE
[1:37:49] BEEN EVANGELIZING AND PREACHING SINCE I
[1:37:51] WAS A YOUNG MAN. IF I'VE EVER LIVED TO
[1:37:54] SEE THE FULFILLMENT OF THAT, you're
[1:37:55] seeing it right now. TAKE THE BIBLE.
[1:37:58] TAKE THE MESSAGE, TAKE THE WORD OF GOD
[1:38:00] AND PROVE WHAT'S WRONG. AND PEOPLE STILL
[1:38:02] LOOK AT YOU AND SAY, "WELL, I DON'T FEEL
[1:38:04] THAT'S RIGHT. I DON'T THINK IT MATTERS."
[1:38:06] WELL, COME ON, CHURCH. BROTHER SAID THEY
[1:38:09] HAVE A FORM OF GODLINESS FUNDAMENTALLY
[1:38:11] RIGHT, BUT WILL DENY THE POWER THEREOF,
[1:38:13] THE POWER OF WHAT? THE POWER OF HEALING,
[1:38:16] THE POWER OF SHOUTING, THE POWER OF
[1:38:18] SPEAKING IN TONGUES, THE POWER OF
[1:38:20] INTERPRETING. LISTEN, THE POWER OF THE
[1:38:23] CHURCH MOVING.
[1:38:25] &gt;&gt; CAN I SAY SOMETHING TO YOU? AMEN. DON'T
[1:38:27] LET IT EVER BE SAID ABOUT ONE MEMBER OF
[1:38:30] GRACE TABERNACLE THAT WE'RE SO
[1:38:31] REBELLIOUS AND WE'RE SO STUBBORN AND
[1:38:34] WE'RE SO INFLUENCED BY THE HISS OF THE
[1:38:36] SERPENT THAT WE [laughter] STAND IN THE
[1:38:38] WAY OF THE CHURCH MOVING FORWARD.
[1:38:42] &gt;&gt; OH, THE CHURCH MOVING FORWARD LIKE IT IN
[1:38:44] THE BEGINNING. OH, BROTHER, SISTER, WE
[1:38:46] ARE CONTENDING FOR THE FAITH. NOW, NOW,
[1:38:48] CAN I SHOW Y'ALL SOMETHING? I'M IN THE
[1:38:49] WORD. IS THAT OKAY? I'm moving to the
[1:38:51] second seal. AMEN. SEDUCING SPIRITS.
[1:38:53] THEY BEGIN TO DENY THE REVELATION of the
[1:38:56] word. REMEMBER SAID SEDUCES WHAT? A
[1:38:59] SEDUCING spirit in the church.
[1:39:03] &gt;&gt; NOW LOOK WHAT A PROPHET SAID. HE SAYS
[1:39:04] THAT IS CLERGY.
[1:39:07] &gt;&gt; Come on.
[1:39:08] &gt;&gt; My goodness.
[1:39:09] &gt;&gt; CAN I CALL WHAT BROTHER CALLED IT,
[1:39:10] BROTHER BRIAN? IS THAT OKAY?
[1:39:13] &gt;&gt; SEDUCING CLERGY SPIRIT.
[1:39:16] &gt;&gt; WORKINGS OF DEVILS. HYPOCRISIES IN THE
[1:39:19] CHURCH. HAVING A FORM OF GODLINESS BUT
[1:39:22] DENYING THE REVELATION THE POWER AND THE
[1:39:24] WORK OF THE SPIRIT FROM SUCH TURN AWAY
[1:39:28] SAID HERE IN THE CHURCH AGE BOOK I'M
[1:39:30] going to lay this in and nail that
[1:39:31] devil's hide down HERE IS WHERE WE
[1:39:34] RECEIVE THE true revelation of the
[1:39:37] serpent seed here IS WHAT REALLY
[1:39:40] HAPPENED IN THE GARDEN OF EDEN THE WORD
[1:39:42] SAYS EVE WAS BEGALLED BY THE SERPENT YOU
[1:39:46] KNOW WHAT HE SAID SHE WAS ACTUALLY
[1:39:48] SEDUCED BY THE SERPENT. LISTEN, FOLKS.
[1:39:52] AMEN. HERE'S SOMEONE AGO ASKING ME THE
[1:39:54] QUESTION NOW. NOW, NOW CAN I CAN I SLOW
[1:39:56] DOWN and and and read this TO YOU?
[1:39:59] [snorts]
[1:39:59] &gt;&gt; DID GOD TELL EVE TO WATCH OUT FOR THE
[1:40:01] serpent or the serpent WOULD SEDUCE HER?
[1:40:04] NOW, LISTEN. GOD DIDN'T HAVE TO SAY ONE
[1:40:07] THING ABOUT WHAT WOULD HAPPEN. JUST GET
[1:40:09] THE POINT OF THE STORY. He simply gave
[1:40:12] the word.
[1:40:14] &gt;&gt; HE SAID NOT TO PARTAKE OF KNOWLEDGE. MY
[1:40:16] GOODNESS. SOMEBODY SAY, "AMEN." AMEN.
[1:40:18] &gt;&gt; PARTAKE OF LIFE.
[1:40:20] &gt;&gt; AND LIFE WAS THE WORD OF GOD. NOW
[1:40:23] LISTEN. AND DEATH WAS ANYTHING THAT THE
[1:40:26] WORD NOW DEATH WAS ANYTHING THAT WASN'T
[1:40:29] THE WORD OF GOD. NOW LISTEN, SHE ALLOWED
[1:40:31] ONE WORD TO BE CHANGED.
[1:40:34] &gt;&gt; Just one WORD TO BE CHANGED, BROTHER
[1:40:36] BOBBY. AND RIGHT THEN, SATAN HAD HER.
[1:40:39] &gt;&gt; MY GOODNESS. HE DIDN'T HAVE HER, BROTHER
[1:40:41] MAD. WHEN WHEN HE BROUGHT THE ACT ABOUT,
[1:40:44] HE HAD HER THE VERY MINUTE HE GOT IN HER
[1:40:46] MIND. AND CONVINCED HER THAT WHAT SHE
[1:40:49] WAS BELIEVING, AMEN, WAS NOT EXACTLY THE
[1:40:51] TRUTH.
[1:40:52] &gt;&gt; CHURCH, I'M PREACHING TO YOU. GOD FORBID
[1:40:55] WE ALLOW THE SERPENT FATHERS TO HISS
[1:40:57] OVER OUR FAMILIES AND HISS OVER OUR
[1:41:00] CHILDREN CUZ WE DON'T HAVE THE CHRISTIAN
[1:41:02] COURAGE TO STAND ON the convictions OF
[1:41:05] THE WORD OF GOD.
[1:41:07] FOLKS, YOU SAY, "PREACHER, YOU'RE
[1:41:08] GETTING PRETTY STRAIGHT ABOUT THIS." I
[1:41:10] AM. BECAUSE THE DEVIL IS TRYING TO
[1:41:12] DESTROY THE HOME. HE'S TRYING TO DESTROY
[1:41:14] THE FAMILY. AND IF HE DESTROYS THE HOME,
[1:41:17] HE WILL DESTROY THE CHURCH. A CHURCH IS
[1:41:20] ONLY AS STRONG AS THE FAMILIES THAT MAKE
[1:41:23] IT UP.
[1:41:27] &gt;&gt; YES, SIR.
[1:41:28] &gt;&gt; God could have said, "Don't pick more
[1:41:31] fruit off of that tree than you can
[1:41:32] eat."
[1:41:34] &gt;&gt; And Satan could say, "Look, that is
[1:41:37] quite right. You see, if you pick too
[1:41:40] much, it'll rot. But here is a method of
[1:41:43] preserving the fruit.
[1:41:45] &gt;&gt; [snorts]
[1:41:47] &gt;&gt; Folks, brother Ram's holding it down,
[1:41:48] ain't he?
[1:41:49] &gt;&gt; AND YET AT THE SAME TIME, YOU CAN PICK
[1:41:52] all you want.
[1:41:56] &gt;&gt; Now, here's a method of being in the
[1:41:59] church and still being in the world.
[1:42:03] &gt;&gt; And here's a method of not believing in
[1:42:06] the power of God and still being in the
[1:42:08] church. And
[1:42:10] &gt;&gt; so you see now look what he said. You
[1:42:12] can have your way and God's way at the
[1:42:15] same time.
[1:42:17] &gt;&gt; The devil would have had her right
[1:42:20] there.
[1:42:21] &gt;&gt; He that is guilty in one point of the
[1:42:22] law has broken the
[1:42:25] &gt;&gt; whole law. Don't you fool with that
[1:42:28] word.
[1:42:30] &gt;&gt; Now, now I'm I'm going to I'm going to
[1:42:32] keep
[1:42:35] &gt;&gt; I'm pushing that devil. Brother Ram will
[1:42:36] keep on bulldozing him. Okay.
[1:42:38] &gt;&gt; Jezebel seduced the servants of God to
[1:42:40] commit fornication. That's right.
[1:42:42] &gt;&gt; Brother Bram said like this. He said I
[1:42:44] suffer. He reads that scripture suffest.
[1:42:46] He said that's tolerate and seduce my
[1:42:48] servants to commit fornication. Now
[1:42:50] brother picks this up and says in this
[1:42:52] satire and church age she is a
[1:42:54] dominating female. She is mystery
[1:42:56] Babylon. She is the great She is
[1:42:58] Jezebel the false prophetess. Why?
[1:43:01] Because the true female is submissive to
[1:43:03] God.
[1:43:07] &gt;&gt; Christ is her head. Now I'm I'm I'm
[1:43:09] going to pull out of this. Okay. She has
[1:43:11] no word but he is.
[1:43:14] &gt;&gt; SHE HAS NO FAULT BUT HIS. SHE HAS NO
[1:43:17] LEADERSHIP BUT HIS. BUT WHAT ABOUT THIS
[1:43:19] CHURCH? SHE HAS CAST OUT THE WORD.
[1:43:23] &gt;&gt; SHE HAS DESTROYED THE BIBLES AND WERE
[1:43:25] THE ESSAYS OF THE GODLY. SHE HAS SLAIN
[1:43:28] THOSE who would preach the truth. She
[1:43:30] has taken over kings, PRINCES, NATIONS,
[1:43:34] CONTROLS ARMIES, AND INSIST THAT THIS IS
[1:43:36] THE TRUE BODY OF CHRIST AND THAT HER
[1:43:38] POPES ARE THE BACKERS OF CHRIST. NOW
[1:43:40] LISTEN TO THE PROPHET. SHE IS ENTIRELY
[1:43:43] SEDUCED BY THE DEVIL.
[1:43:46] &gt;&gt; UNTIL SHE IN TURN HAS BECOME THE seducer
[1:43:49] of others.
[1:43:52] &gt;&gt; SO YOU MEAN WHEN SOMEBODY BECOMES
[1:43:54] SEDUCED by the devil,
[1:43:56] &gt;&gt; they begin to start trying to seduce
[1:43:58] others
[1:43:59] &gt;&gt; into the error that they're a part of.
[1:44:03] &gt;&gt; But she now it's pretty straight. SHE IS
[1:44:05] THE BRIDE OF SATAN. NOW WATCH THIS. HAS
[1:44:08] PRODUCED HIS MASTERCH CHILD RELIGIONS.
[1:44:10] &gt;&gt; NOW, NOW, NOW WATCH THIS. SEDUCING
[1:44:12] SPIRITS WILL LEAD PEOPLE FROM TRUTH TO
[1:44:15] ERROR.
[1:44:16] &gt;&gt; LOOK WHAT LOOK WHAT PAUL SAID. HE SAID,
[1:44:18] "AFTER MY DEPARTING, SHALL GRIEVOUS
[1:44:19] WOLVES ENTER IN AMONG YOU, NOT SPARING
[1:44:21] THE FLOCK. ALSO, OF YOUR OWN SELVES
[1:44:23] SHALL MEN ARISE, SPEAKING PERVERSE
[1:44:25] THINGS." NOW, WHAT ARE THEY GOING TO DO?
[1:44:27] TO DRAW AWAY DISCIPLES AFTER THEM. YOU
[1:44:29] KNOW WHAT TIMOTHY SAID? HE SAID,
[1:44:31] "SEDUCERS SHALL WAX WORSE AND WORSE.
[1:44:34] THEY will deceive and be deceived." BUT
[1:44:37] LOOK WHAT HE SAYS IN SECOND TIMOTHY 2
[1:44:39] TIMOTHY 3:14. HE SAYS, "BUT CONTINUE
[1:44:41] THOU IN THE THINGS WHICH THOU HAST
[1:44:45] LEARNED AND HAS BEEN ASSURED OF KNOWING
[1:44:48] OF THEM, KNOWING OF WHOM THOU HAST
[1:44:50] LEARNED THEM, OH CHURCH OF THE LIVING
[1:44:52] GOD, WHEN THE WORLD HAS BELIEVED A
[1:44:56] SEDUCING SPIRIT AND IS FULFILLING
[1:44:58] PROPHECY AND IS DEPARTING FROM THE FAITH
[1:45:01] AND HAS BECOME THE SEDUCER OF OTHERS."
[1:45:03] HALLELUJAH. THERE WILL BE A BRIDE WHO
[1:45:07] WILL BE STANDING UNDER THE HEADSHIP OF
[1:45:10] CHRIST THE WORD. SHE WILL BE POSITIONED
[1:45:13] UNDER THE REVELATION. SHE WILL NOT HAVE
[1:45:15] TIME FOR MAN'S IDEAS. SHE WILL NOT HAVE
[1:45:18] TIME FOR SEDUCING SPIRITS BECAUSE SHE
[1:45:21] WILL BE STANDING AS A CONTENDER FOR THE
[1:45:24] FAITH THAT WAS ONCE DELIVERED TO THE
[1:45:26] SAINT. OH, I WONDER THIS MORNING. IS
[1:45:28] THERE ANYBODY SAY, "LISTEN HERE, DEVIL.
[1:45:30] YOU MIGHT HAVE GOT THE FIRST EVE, BUT
[1:45:32] YOU WON'T GET THIS ONE.
[1:45:34] YOU MIGHT HAVE GOT THE FIRST EVE, BUT
[1:45:36] YOU WILL NOT GET THIS ONE BECAUSE YOU
[1:45:38] WILL NOT HISS OVER MY FAMILY. YOU WILL
[1:45:41] NOT HISS OVER MY CONVICTIONS. YOU WILL
[1:45:43] NOT HISS OVER THIS CHURCH. You will not
[1:45:45] hiss over this pastor. You will not hiss
[1:45:48] over this pullpit. WE ARE THE BRIDE OF
[1:45:51] JESUS CHRIST. AND WE STAND FOR the
[1:45:53] restoration OF THE FAITH OF GOD BY THE
[1:45:56] WORD OF GOD.
[1:46:00] &gt;&gt; NOW,
[1:46:02] somebody shout amen. Somebody give the
[1:46:04] Lord a hand clap of praise. [applause]
[1:46:08] Got to pull up out of it. Amen. Now
[1:46:11] listen. THOSE THAT DEPART from the
[1:46:13] faith, you know what? They become
[1:46:16] repribates.
[1:46:17] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:46:17] &gt;&gt; Concerning the faith.
[1:46:19] &gt;&gt; Now, I'm going to skip over some stuff
[1:46:20] here because I want to get to something.
[1:46:24] Jesus said this,
[1:46:26] [snorts] "When the Son of man cometh,
[1:46:29] shall he find faith?"
[1:46:32] Remember said, "Will he find Malachi 4
[1:46:34] fulfilled?"
[1:46:36] &gt;&gt; Now, come on, folks.
[1:46:38] &gt;&gt; Malachi 4, Elijah the prophet, William,
[1:46:42] Mary, and Brandon is off the scene
[1:46:44] today.
[1:46:46] &gt;&gt; He is not here in a physical corporate
[1:46:48] body. I don't care how much spiritual
[1:46:50] fanaticism people come up with.
[1:46:52] &gt;&gt; He is not here in a corporate body.
[1:46:55] &gt;&gt; BUT THE WORD OF MALACHI 4
[1:46:58] &gt;&gt; IS RIGHT HERE. AND WHAT HAS IT DONE? IT
[1:47:01] HAS RESTORED THE FAITH. NOW I WANT I
[1:47:03] WANT TO SAY THIS TO YOU. SOME WERE
[1:47:05] ORDAINED to depart.
[1:47:09] &gt;&gt; But brother, SOME WERE ORDAINED TO
[1:47:12] CONTEND.
[1:47:15] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. BROTHER MORGAN, SOME WERE
[1:47:17] ordained to believe them seducing
[1:47:19] SPIRITS AND TO ALLOW HYPOCRISY AND TO
[1:47:22] FOLLOW THE HISS OF THE SERPENT AND TO
[1:47:24] LET THE DEVIL BEGILE THEM IN THEIR MINDS
[1:47:26] AND DESTROY THEIR HOMES AND DESTROY
[1:47:28] THEIR FAMILY. BUT THERE WERE SOME,
[1:47:30] BROTHER JARED THAT WAS ORDAINED TO
[1:47:32] CONTEND. YOU KNOW WHAT BROTHER SAID? HE
[1:47:34] SAID RIGHT HERE HE SAID NOW HOW MANY
[1:47:36] BELIEVES JESUS CHRIST? WILL YOU RAISE
[1:47:38] YOUR HAND? HOW MANY WILL SAY I BELIEVE
[1:47:40] JESUS CHRIST? NOW BROTHER SAYS THAT AND
[1:47:42] HE STOPS AND SAYS HOW MANY WILL RAISE
[1:47:44] YOUR HAND AND SAY I WILL NEVER DOUBT NO
[1:47:47] MORE IN MY LIFE.
[1:47:50] &gt;&gt; How many will raise your hand and say I
[1:47:51] will never doubt no more in my life? Now
[1:47:53] this is a trick question.
[1:47:55] &gt;&gt; How many will raise your hand and say I
[1:47:57] will not doubt no more in my life. real
[1:47:58] high. You'll raise it real high.
[1:48:01] Rebraham said, "Why was it some of you
[1:48:03] camp your hands down?"
[1:48:05] &gt;&gt; I'm I'm I told you, but I'm in the
[1:48:08] quote, not in the church. Okay? Though
[1:48:10] one would RAISE FROM THE DEAD, YET YOU
[1:48:11] WOULD NOT BELIEVE. HE SAID, "NO MATTER
[1:48:13] WHAT WOULD TAKE PLACE, THERE'S PEOPLE
[1:48:16] THAT WERE BORN NOT TO BELIEVE."
[1:48:18] &gt;&gt; THE BIBLE SAID THEY WERE ORDAINED OF OLD
[1:48:20] TO THIS CONDEMNATION. OH, BUT AREN'T YOU
[1:48:24] HAPPY TONIGHT,
[1:48:26] &gt;&gt; BROTHER MARK? AREN'T YOU HAPPY TONIGHT
[1:48:29] THAT GOD HAS TENDERED YOUR HEART TO LOOK
[1:48:32] TO CALVARY and [cheering and applause]
[1:48:34] believe?
[1:48:37] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. You say, "WHY ARE YOU
[1:48:38] HAPPY?" BECAUSE HE SHALL TURN THE HEART
[1:48:42] OF THE FATHERS TO THE CHILDREN. HE SHALL
[1:48:44] TURN THE HEART OF THE CHILDREN TO THE
[1:48:46] FATHER. AREN'T YOU HAPPY TONIGHT THAT
[1:48:48] THE MESSAGE OF THE HOUR WHICH HAS BEEN
[1:48:51] PREACHED IN THE POWER OF THE HOLY GHOST
[1:48:53] HAS TENDERED YOUR HEART AND YOU CAN LOOK
[1:48:55] AWAY FROM THE SERPENTS? You can look
[1:48:57] away from seducing spirits and you can
[1:48:59] look to Jesus and live.
[1:49:02] &gt;&gt; Turn back to the faith. Turn back to the
[1:49:05] Bible. Now, can I say something to you,
[1:49:07] brother Andrew? What is this message of
[1:49:09] the hour you're talking about? Are you
[1:49:10] ready for it?
[1:49:11] &gt;&gt; Are are you ready?
[1:49:13] REPENT
[1:49:15] [snorts]
[1:49:15] &gt;&gt; AND TURN BACK TO THE FAITH OF THE
[1:49:17] FATHERS.
[1:49:20] &gt;&gt; Turn now. Now say this with me. Turn
[1:49:22] back to the faith.
[1:49:25] &gt;&gt; Can you say something else? Contend for
[1:49:28] the faith.
[1:49:28] &gt;&gt; Contend for the faith.
[1:49:30] &gt;&gt; Can I take it a step further?
[1:49:32] &gt;&gt; Continue in the faith.
[1:49:34] &gt;&gt; Continue in THE FAITH.
[1:49:36] &gt;&gt; TURN BACK TO THE FAITH.
[1:49:38] &gt;&gt; CONTEND FOR THE FAITH. CONTINUE THOU IN
[1:49:40] THE FAITH. GROUNDED AND SETTLED AND BE
[1:49:43] NOT MOVED AWAY FROM THE HOPE OF THE
[1:49:45] GOSPEL WHICH YE HAVE HEARD AND WHICH WAS
[1:49:48] PREACHED TO EVERY CREATURE WHICH IS
[1:49:49] UNDER HEAVEN. WHEREFORE I APOLOG
[1:49:52] SAID, WHAT IS IT? He said, IT'S A
[1:49:54] COMMISSION TO US TO CONTINUE. HOLD ON
[1:49:58] UNTIL HE COMES.
[1:50:00] &gt;&gt; WELL, LET ME HAVE SOME PREACHING ROOM.
[1:50:03] HOLD ON UNTIL HE COMES. HALLELUJAH.
[1:50:06] BROTHER ANTHONY, THERE IS A PEOPLE ON
[1:50:08] THE FACE OF THE EARTH THIS MORNING WHO
[1:50:10] WILL NOT TURN LOOSE. THEY WILL NOT BACK
[1:50:13] UP. THEY WILL NOT LAY DOWN. THEY WILL
[1:50:15] NOT COMPROMISE. THEY WILL NOT GIVE IN.
[1:50:17] THEY WILL HOLD ON. They will hold on.
[1:50:19] REMEMBER THE MATCH. THEY WILL HOLD ON IN
[1:50:21] THE GOOD TIMES. THEY WILL HOLD ON IN THE
[1:50:23] BAD TIMES. THEY WILL HOLD ON when
[1:50:25] they're on the mountain. THEY WILL HOLD
[1:50:26] ON WHEN THEY'RE IN THE VALLEY. BECAUSE
[1:50:28] YOU WILL BE ESTABLISHED in the faith.
[1:50:32] &gt;&gt; Now, I want to say something to you.
[1:50:35] There's only two types of people left in
[1:50:36] the earth today.
[1:50:38] &gt;&gt; Are you ready for this,
[1:50:39] &gt;&gt; Brother Bobby? It's contenders
[1:50:43] and departers.
[1:50:47] &gt;&gt; Contenders know who they were. I I'm I
[1:50:50] got a few more. Can I have a few more
[1:50:52] minutes?
[1:50:54] &gt;&gt; Jesus know it by faith in the revelation
[1:50:57] of God's word in his own predestinated
[1:50:59] life. Jesus knew who he was.
[1:51:02] &gt;&gt; How many believes that?
[1:51:04] &gt;&gt; How many will accept the rest of it?
[1:51:06] &gt;&gt; Satan was wondering.
[1:51:11] &gt;&gt; JESUS KNEW WHO HE WAS.
[1:51:13] &gt;&gt; SATAN WAS WONDERING. HE KNOW THAT HE WAS
[1:51:16] A PREDESTINATED CREATURE OF GOD. THAT
[1:51:18] GOD HIMSELF WAS MANIFESTED IN HIM. IT
[1:51:22] WASN'T HIM DOING THE WORKS. NOW, IF
[1:51:24] JESUS knew who he was, THEN WHAT ABOUT
[1:51:26] THIS PREDESTINATED BRIDE BODY?
[1:51:29] &gt;&gt; COME ON, CHURCH. I'm preaching to you
[1:51:30] this morning. I'M GOING TO DELIVER THE
[1:51:32] MAIL TO YOUR ADDRESS. YOU MAY BE WEAK.
[1:51:35] YOU MAY BE TIRED, BUT YOU'RE A
[1:51:37] CONTENDER.
[1:51:39] &gt;&gt; You may be weary AND WELLOING, BUT
[1:51:41] YOU'RE A CONTENDER. YOU MAY BE
[1:51:43] BROKENHEARTED, BUT YOU'RE A CONTENDER.
[1:51:45] YOU MAY BE IN A PLACE WHERE YOU DON'T
[1:51:47] KNOW WHICH WAY TO TURN, BUT YOU'RE A
[1:51:49] CONTENDER. You may be perplexed, BUT YOU
[1:51:52] ARE NOT GOING TO RENOUNCE ALL YOUR HOPE
[1:51:55] BECAUSE YOU ARE A CONTENDER. [applause]
[1:51:59] And you know WHAT THE BIBLE SAYS? THE
[1:52:01] BIBLE SAYS THE PEOPLE, CAN I CHANGE
[1:52:04] THAT? THE CONTENDERS [laughter] THAT DO
[1:52:06] KNOW THEIR GOD SHALL BE WEAK AND BARELY
[1:52:09] HOLDING ON AND BARELY OVERCOMING and
[1:52:12] barely able to worship and barely make
[1:52:15] it to CHURCH AND BARELY STAY AWAKE WHILE
[1:52:17] THE PREACHER'S PREACHING. OH NO, THOSE
[1:52:20] THAT KNOW THEIR GOD WILL BE STRONG.
[1:52:24] THEY'LL BE STRONG AND THEY'LL DO GREAT
[1:52:27] EXPLOITS. You know WHY THEY'LL BE
[1:52:29] STRONG? BECAUSE THEY'RE ON SOME
[1:52:30] VITAMINS. [laughter]
[1:52:32] Oh yeah. The prodigal said, "We need
[1:52:34] some spiritual vitamins in the church
[1:52:36] today." You know what he said? He said,
[1:52:38] "If the children get the right kind of
[1:52:41] vitamins,
[1:52:44] &gt;&gt; come on. Come on all you
[1:52:47] vitamin pushers.
[1:52:53] &gt;&gt; Is it safe?"
[1:52:58] &gt;&gt; I woke up this morning and my little toe
[1:53:00] hurt. I got a vitamin for it.
[1:53:05] I come home and my back hurt. I got
[1:53:06] three vitamins for it.
[1:53:10] &gt;&gt; Come home and my wife looked at me
[1:53:11] wrong. I got a vitamin for it.
[1:53:14] I was driving down the road and while I
[1:53:16] was driving my eyes went got a vitamin
[1:53:19] for it.
[1:53:22] I'm not preaching against vitamins. I
[1:53:23] take them.
[1:53:25] &gt;&gt; BUT A PROPHET OF GOD SAID IF YOU EVER
[1:53:27] GET THESE SPIRITUAL VITAMINS, YOU'LL
[1:53:29] ALWAYS FEEL GOOD.
[1:53:32] I JUST IDENTIFIED YOUR BAD MOOD PROBLEM.
[1:53:35] &gt;&gt; I JUST IDENTIFIED WHY SOMETIMES YOU COME
[1:53:37] TO CHURCH AND YOU'RE ON TOP OF THE world
[1:53:39] and sometimes you come in HERE AND IT
[1:53:41] LOOKS LIKE THE WORLD'S ON TOP OF YOU.
[1:53:43] IT'S BECAUSE YOU'VE NOT BEEN TAKING YOUR
[1:53:45] VITAMINS. BUT IF YOU'LL GET BACK IN THE
[1:53:48] WORD OF GOD AND QUIT ACCEPTING THE HISS
[1:53:50] OF THE SERPENT AND START FEEDING ON THE
[1:53:53] VITAMINS OF THE WORD OF GOD, YOU'LL FEEL
[1:53:55] GOOD ON SUNDAY AND YOU'LL FEEL GOOD ON
[1:53:58] MONDAY. YOU'LL FEEL GOOD ON TUESDAY AND
[1:54:00] YOU'LL FEEL GOOD ON WEDNESDAY. YOU'LL
[1:54:02] FEEL GOOD ON Thursday and you'll FEEL
[1:54:04] LIKE GOING TO CHURCH ON SUNDAY. WHY?
[1:54:07] BECAUSE YOU'RE A PART OF THE PROPHETIC
[1:54:09] WORD. YOU ARE HERE TO contend for the
[1:54:12] faith.
[1:54:14] &gt;&gt; Now, I want to bring this down to you.
[1:54:17] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:54:18] &gt;&gt; I want to bring this down right here.
[1:54:22] &gt;&gt; Contend.
[1:54:24] If you got a few minutes,
[1:54:27] &gt;&gt; an hour and three minutes. That's how
[1:54:28] long I've been preaching.
[1:54:32] Contend don't mean to exactly argue.
[1:54:37] &gt;&gt; Direct quote.
[1:54:38] &gt;&gt; Brother Brian, Brother Bram said,
[1:54:41] contend means to debate.
[1:54:44] &gt;&gt; You know what, brother? Brother Matt, I
[1:54:46] found out something. There is a
[1:54:48] difference in arguing and debating.
[1:54:53] &gt;&gt; Some of you kids just woke up.
[1:54:58] What do you mean? Well, in college they
[1:55:01] have debate classes, right?
[1:55:04] &gt;&gt; They don't call them arguing sessions.
[1:55:06] &gt;&gt; I I'm that guy. Okay. Brother Tom, I had
[1:55:09] to know what's the difference in
[1:55:10] debating and arguing. I'm I'm not going
[1:55:12] to read the whole thing, J. I'm just
[1:55:13] going to read this one thing. A core
[1:55:16] distinction is distinction is intent and
[1:55:18] approach.
[1:55:20] Debate uses reason
[1:55:23] &gt;&gt; and facts
[1:55:24] &gt;&gt; for understanding
[1:55:26] &gt;&gt; or victory.
[1:55:29] &gt;&gt; Did I read THAT RIGHT?
[1:55:31] &gt;&gt; WHILE A COMMON ARGUMENT RELIES ON
[1:55:33] emotion
[1:55:35] &gt;&gt; and ego and OFTEN LEADS TO CONFLICT
[1:55:38] RATHER THAN RESOLUTION.
[1:55:40] &gt;&gt; YOU CAN HAVE LOGICAL ARGUMENTS WITHIN A
[1:55:42] DEBATE, BUT AN ARGUMENT ITSELF, IT OFTEN
[1:55:46] LACKS THE STRUCTURE.
[1:55:50] THAT A THAT A DEBATE CARRIES. NOW, I
[1:55:53] picked that up. You don't debate your
[1:55:54] parents.
[1:55:57] &gt;&gt; I'm going somewhere.
[1:55:58] &gt;&gt; IN JUDE 1:9, JUST A FEW VERSES DOWN. Are
[1:56:01] you READY FOR THIS? YET MICHAEL THE
[1:56:03] ARCHANGEL,
[1:56:05] &gt;&gt; WHEN CONTENDING WITH THE DEVIL,
[1:56:07] &gt;&gt; DISPUTED ABOUT THE BODY OF MOSES, DUR
[1:56:10] NOT BRING a railing accusation,
[1:56:13] BUT SAID, "THE LORD REBUKE YOU."
[1:56:16] REMEMBER SAID, "LOOK HERE." AMEN. NOW
[1:56:18] WATCH THIS. NOW I WANT TO BACK UP HERE
[1:56:19] AND PULL THIS OUT FOR just a second.
[1:56:20] This is not this is not brother Ram.
[1:56:22] This is Bible commentary, okay? It's not
[1:56:24] of authority. Take or leave it. It's
[1:56:25] just I thought it was good. Jude is
[1:56:27] warning THE FALSE CHURCH ABOUT FALSE
[1:56:29] TEACHERS. MICHAEL THE ARCHANGEL is the
[1:56:32] chief angelic defender OF GOD'S PEOPLE.
[1:56:34] NOW WATCH THIS. DESPITE HIS AUTHORITY,
[1:56:38] MICHAEL DOES NOT RELY ON PERSONAL POWER
[1:56:41] or insults when confronting the devil.
[1:56:45] THE JEWISH TRADITION SUGGESTS THAT THIS
[1:56:47] INVOLVEMENT WAS PREVENTING AN MISUSE OR
[1:56:51] IDOLATRY OF MOSES BODY. SO THEY WERE
[1:56:54] THEY WERE THEY WERE AR THEY WERE TRYING
[1:56:56] TO ARGUE THAT YOU'VE DONE SOMETHING WITH
[1:56:58] MOSES'S BODY. WHERE IS IT AT? NOW WATCH
[1:57:01] THIS. DUR NOT BRING A railing
[1:57:03] accusation.
[1:57:05] Michael did not insult.
[1:57:08] &gt;&gt; He did not MOCK SATAN. HE DID NOT CLAIM
[1:57:13] AUTHORITY IN HIMSELF. HE JUST SIMPLY
[1:57:15] SAID,
[1:57:18] "GLORY TO GOD. [screaming] THE LORD WHO
[1:57:20] GLORY LORD REBUKE YOU."
[1:57:27] &gt;&gt; STANDING THERE GOING BACK AND FORTH,
[1:57:28] BROTHER BOBBY AND MICHAEL JUST SAID,
[1:57:31] "The Lord rebuke
[1:57:32] &gt;&gt; thee."
[1:57:36] &gt;&gt; I'M GOING SOMEWHERE.
[1:57:37] &gt;&gt; LOOK AT THIS. WHY JUDE USES THIS
[1:57:40] EXAMPLE? IT CONTRASTS MICHAEL WITH FALSE
[1:57:43] TEACHERS WHO SPEAK ARROGANTLY ABOUT
[1:57:46] SPIRITUAL THINGS.
[1:57:49] &gt;&gt; THEY MOCK AUTHORITY
[1:57:51] AND ASSUME POWER GOD NEVER GAVE THEM. IF
[1:57:55] MICHAEL WOULD NOT SPEAK PRESUMPTUOUSLY
[1:57:57] AGAINST even Satan, HOW MUCH MORE SHOULD
[1:58:00] HUMANS BE CAREFUL?
[1:58:01] &gt;&gt; I love this. Are Are y'all ready for
[1:58:03] this?
[1:58:04] &gt;&gt; SPIRITUAL VICTORY IS NOT IN VOLUME.
[1:58:08] AMEN.
[1:58:08] &gt;&gt; BRAVADO OR INSULTS, BUT IN ALIGNMENT
[1:58:12] WITH GOD'S WORD.
[1:58:15] &gt;&gt; YOU'RE NOT VICTORIOUS ON HOW LOUD YOU
[1:58:17] ARE.
[1:58:18] &gt;&gt; AND Y'ALL KNOW I'M LOUD. YOU'RE NOT
[1:58:20] VICTORIOUS ON HOW EMOTIONAL YOU ARE.
[1:58:23] YOU'RE VICTORIOUS ON HOW ALIGNED WITH
[1:58:26] GOD'S WORD YOU ARE WHEN YOU'RE STANDING
[1:58:28] TOE-TO-TOE WITH THAT DEVIL. JUDE 1:9
[1:58:31] TEACHES THAT TRUE SPIRITUAL AUTHORITY IS
[1:58:34] EXERCISED THROUGH HUMILITY AND
[1:58:37] SUBMISSION TO GOD. IT'S NOT ARROGANCE.
[1:58:42] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH.
[1:58:43] &gt;&gt; Are y'all ready for this?
[1:58:45] &gt;&gt; Even when confronting evil.
[1:58:49] &gt;&gt; Now, can I can I drop something to you?
[1:58:51] &gt;&gt; I took time this morning to listen to
[1:58:52] it. Very powerful. If you want it, I'll
[1:58:54] send it to you. TL Osborne gave his
[1:58:56] testimony. I shared it with some of the
[1:58:57] brothers. T Osburn gave his testimony
[1:59:00] when he watched Brother Random in a
[1:59:01] prayer line. You know what he said,
[1:59:02] Sister Lillian? He said, "I was a
[1:59:03] Pentecostal." He said, "I believe the
[1:59:06] louder you were, the better off you
[1:59:07] could be."
[1:59:08] &gt;&gt; He said, "I believe the quicker you
[1:59:09] could get the atmosphere all worked up
[1:59:11] and get loud and volume and noise." He
[1:59:13] said, "The more noisier, the better
[1:59:14] chance that devil was going to go." He
[1:59:16] said, "And here walked a little deaf and
[1:59:18] dumb girl, I believe it was, or blind
[1:59:20] girl, one of the two, walked before
[1:59:21] brother." And TL Osborne said, "I was up
[1:59:23] there, Brother Charles. She was up there
[1:59:25] in the balcony." And he said, "I was
[1:59:26] watching that." And he said, "I was a
[1:59:28] Pentecostal." He said, "I was ready to
[1:59:30] go." I I'm I'm out of time. I'm probably
[1:59:32] butchering this, but he said, "I was
[1:59:34] ready to go, brother Roy." He said, "I
[1:59:35] was ready to get up there and scream and
[1:59:37] let's get this devil out of there." He
[1:59:38] said, ' And before I could even get my
[1:59:40] head bowed, he said, ' And get it back
[1:59:42] up again, I heard brother Brandham say
[1:59:45] these words. Satan, in the name of the
[1:59:48] Lord Jesus Christ, I adjure thee by the
[1:59:51] power OF THE LIVING GOD, COME OUT OF THE
[1:59:53] GIRL, AND NEVER TORMENT her no more
[1:59:55] according to what was done THAT DAY AT
[1:59:57] CALVARY. He said, and he said, now raise
[2:00:00] your head, audience, the girl as well.
[2:00:03] HE SAID, "RIGHT THERE, I SAW, AMEN, WHAT
[2:00:05] A SON OF GOD DOES UNDER THE AUTHORITY OF
[2:00:08] THE WORD OF GOD." LISTEN, FOLKS, I I I
[2:00:11] DON'T HAVE TIME TO READ IT TO YOU, BUT I
[2:00:12] WANT TO SAY IT TO YOU. I DID SOME
[2:00:14] STUDYING LAST NIGHT, AND YOU KNOW WHAT I
[2:00:16] FOUND THE PROPHET SAID? HE SAID THIS,
[2:00:18] "SATAN HASN'T GOT NOTHING TO DO ABOUT
[2:00:20] IT. DON'T YOU ARGUE WITH HIM. DON'T YOU
[2:00:23] FUSS WITH HIM. YOU JUST IGNORE HIM AND
[2:00:26] WALK AWAY. IF YOU KEEP ON FUSSING WITH
[2:00:28] HIM, YOU'LL FUSS ALL DAY AND ALL NIGHT."
[2:00:31] THE BIBLE SAID, "RESIST THE DEVIL."
[2:00:34] HALLELUJAH. Resist the devil and he will
[2:00:38] flee from you. COME ON, CHURCH. WE'RE
[2:00:41] NOT A BUNCH OF DEBATE ARGUERS. WE'RE NOT
[2:00:44] A BUNCH OF FUSTERS AND FIGHTERS. WE ARE
[2:00:46] SONS AND DAUGHTERS OF GOD. WE ARE
[2:00:48] CONTENDERS AND WE ARE HERE.
[2:00:51] &gt;&gt; AND I TELL YOU, [laughter] I'M
[2:00:53] [clears throat]
[2:00:54] &gt;&gt; YOU KNOW WHAT THE PROPHET GOD SAID? HE
[2:00:56] SAID, "GOD AND THE DEVIL GOT A DEBATE
[2:00:57] ONE TIME ABOUT JOB." You know that? HE
[2:01:00] SAID GOD AND SATAN HAD A DEBATE ABOUT
[2:01:02] JOB. AND YOU KNOW WHAT HE SAID, BROTHER
[2:01:04] MORGAN? JOB LOOKED AT THE LOOKED AT OR
[2:01:06] THE DEVIL LOOKED AT GOD AND SAID, "IF
[2:01:08] YOU'LL JUST GIVE HIM TO ME, I'LL MAKE
[2:01:10] HIM CURSE YOU TO YOUR FACE." YOU KNOW
[2:01:11] WHAT A PROPHET SAID? HE SAID, "AND GOD
[2:01:13] TOLD SATAN, I'VE GOT A SERVANT IN THE
[2:01:16] EARTH. THERE'S NONE LIKE HIM. WHATEVER I
[2:01:18] SAY TO HIM, HE WILL DO IT. HE'S A
[2:01:21] PERFECT MAN AND A JUST MAN." AND SATAN
[2:01:23] SAID, "IF you'll just let me have him,
[2:01:25] I'LL TAKE HIM AND MAKE HIM CURSE YOU TO
[2:01:28] YOUR FACE." JOB NOT KNOWING ALL THESE
[2:01:31] THINGS WERE GOING ON, IT BROUGHT THE
[2:01:33] PATRIARCH INTO A DEEP DISTRESS. BROTHER
[2:01:36] JARED, YET SOMEHOW WHEN ALL WAS GONE
[2:01:40] FROM HIM,
[2:01:41] HE STILL MAINTAINED HIS POSITION IN
[2:01:46] CHRIST.
[2:01:48] OH, CARTER, I SAY, GOD, GIVE US SOME
[2:01:50] MORE JOBS. COME ON, FOLKS. WHEN THE
[2:01:53] DEVIL AND GOD GOT INTO A DEBATE ABOUT
[2:01:55] JOB, GOD DIDN'T GO TO THE LIBRARIES AND
[2:01:58] GET SOME BOOKS FOR MATERIAL AGAINST THE
[2:02:00] DEVIL. DO YOU KNOW THE MATERIAL THAT GOD
[2:02:02] USED AGAINST THE DEVIL AND HIS DEBATE
[2:02:05] ABOUT JOB WAS THE LIFE THAT JOB WAS
[2:02:08] LIVING?
[2:02:10] GLORY TO GOD. THE LIFE I'LL TEAR THAT
[2:02:13] WALL OUT TODAY FOR YOU. THE LIFE THAT
[2:02:16] JOB WAS LIVING WAS THE MATERIAL THAT GOD
[2:02:19] USED AGAINST THE DEVIL. COME ON, FOLKS.
[2:02:23] HE HIT SOME LOW SPOTS. HE HIT SOME
[2:02:25] PLACES WHERE HE DIDN'T FEEL LIKE
[2:02:27] SCREAMING. HE DIDN'T FEEL LIKE SHOUTING.
[2:02:29] HE DIDN'T FEEL LIKE DANCING. BUT IN THE
[2:02:31] FACE OF ALL OF IT, BROTHER JARED, HE
[2:02:34] STILL MAINTAINED HIS POSITION IN CHRIST
[2:02:37] BECAUSE HE WAS A CONTENDER.
[2:02:43] &gt;&gt; Can I show you this? Brother Bam never
[2:02:44] stood there and said, "Now Satan, I'm
[2:02:46] going to fuss with you."
[2:02:49] &gt;&gt; Brother Brian, he never stood there and
[2:02:50] said, "Come here. I want to argue with
[2:02:52] you a minute.
[2:02:54] He said, "Now, devil, I challenge you to
[2:02:57] a debate."
[2:03:02] &gt;&gt; Satan, you are aware you're whipped.
[2:03:05] &gt;&gt; You have no legal rights.
[2:03:07] &gt;&gt; Jesus Christ, my Lord, stripped you of
[2:03:09] every authority you had when he died at
[2:03:10] Calvary to take away sin and sickness.
[2:03:12] And you're nothing but a bluff. And
[2:03:14] we're calling your bluff. And you know
[2:03:16] that when our Lord came on the tree, he
[2:03:19] cursed the tree. And the next day it was
[2:03:21] withering. And our Lord said to his
[2:03:23] disciples, "Have faith in God. For if
[2:03:25] you shall say to this mountain, be moved
[2:03:27] and don't doubt in your heart, but
[2:03:28] believe what you've said will come to
[2:03:29] pass, you can have what YOU SAID."
[2:03:31] SATAN, YOU KNOW THE SCRIPTURE ON THAT.
[2:03:33] And I I got to close my Bible. I'll keep
[2:03:36] ON PREACHING. AND I HAVE JUST TAUGHT
[2:03:39] THIS PEOPLE THAT GOD IS IN THEM.
[2:03:44] &gt;&gt; YOU KNOW WHAT THE PROPHET SAID? HE SAID,
[2:03:46] "WHAT IS THE FAITH?" HE SAID IT'S THE
[2:03:48] SPIRIT OF CHRIST THAT WAS IN the
[2:03:50] apostles. I HAVE JUST TAUGHT THEM THAT
[2:03:53] GOD IS IN THEM AND IF GOD IS IN THEM AND
[2:03:56] THEY SPEAK TO THAT DISEASE AND SAY BE
[2:03:59] AWAY FROM ME AND DON'T DIE IN THEIR
[2:04:01] HEART RIGHT THEN THAT DISEASE HAS TO
[2:04:03] MOVE FOR IT'S NOT THEM THAT SPEAKS. IT'S
[2:04:06] THE FATHER IN THEM THAT SPEAKS. THEY'RE
[2:04:08] IN NEED. SO COME OUT OF THEM IN THE NAME
[2:04:10] OF JESUS CHRIST.
[2:04:14] &gt;&gt; What are you saying, brother Andrew? I
[2:04:16] challenge you to a debate. You don't
[2:04:18] have any legal power. Satan, you have no
[2:04:22] power over them.
[2:04:25] &gt;&gt; Y'all want something to shout on all
[2:04:27] week?
[2:04:30] &gt;&gt; Anybody? Two of you.
[2:04:34] &gt;&gt; You have no power over them. You didn't
[2:04:37] have it in the first place.
[2:04:40] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:04:41] &gt;&gt; Stand on your feet and give GOD PRAISE.
[2:04:45] YOU DIDN'T HAVE IT in the first place.
[2:04:49] &gt;&gt; You was only bluffing them.
[2:04:52] &gt;&gt; You was only bluffing.
[2:04:54] &gt;&gt; But Christ stripped you of everything
[2:04:56] you had at Calvary.
[2:04:57] &gt;&gt; He stripped every power you ever had.
[2:05:00] And you're nothing but a bluff. And we
[2:05:02] called you a bluff. And they are the
[2:05:05] children of God
[2:05:07] &gt;&gt; now.
[2:05:09] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:05:10] &gt;&gt; Contending.
[2:05:11] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:05:12] &gt;&gt; For the faith.
[2:05:13] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen.
[2:05:14] &gt;&gt; Some are departing,
[2:05:16] &gt;&gt; giving heed to seducing spirits,
[2:05:19] &gt;&gt; giving up their revelation of who they
[2:05:21] are in the word.
[2:05:23] &gt;&gt; Backing up at every little issue that
[2:05:24] arises.
[2:05:27] &gt;&gt; Come on. Break that spirit right now.
[2:05:29] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:05:30] &gt;&gt; Break it.
[2:05:32] &gt;&gt; Break that devil right now.
[2:05:35] &gt;&gt; He's hanging over,
[2:05:37] &gt;&gt; but just go ahead and break him right
[2:05:38] now.
[2:05:39] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[2:05:40] &gt;&gt; Just go and say, "I'm going to stand
[2:05:41] with the word of God.
[2:05:44] I'm not going to be seduced
[2:05:48] &gt;&gt; not going to receive these things in my
[2:05:50] mind. My my spiritual womb is closed
[2:05:55] &gt;&gt; by the word of God.
[2:05:57] &gt;&gt; I'm a son of God. I'm a daughter of God.
[2:06:01] I'm in a position that God gave me and
[2:06:04] I'm contending
[2:06:06] contending for the faith. Years ago, I
[2:06:09] was over in West Virginia and I was
[2:06:11] preaching there and Brother Matt Vest
[2:06:13] and I was rabbit hunting a lot and we
[2:06:15] got done rabbit hunting one day and he
[2:06:17] said you know he said I'm looking for a
[2:06:19] special gun. He said I'm looking for a
[2:06:23] 410 contender.
[2:06:25] I said ever heard of one of those. I He
[2:06:28] said yeah. He said it's a little it's a
[2:06:29] a 410 shotgun contender pistol. Some of
[2:06:31] you probably know what I'm talking
[2:06:32] about. Brother Phil,
[2:06:34] anybody know that contender? You know.
[2:06:36] And I said I've never seen one of those.
[2:06:38] I'd like to see one. He said well he
[2:06:40] said I I've been been wanting one. and
[2:06:41] he said, "Let's just stop here by the
[2:06:42] pawn shop." So, we pulled in at the pawn
[2:06:44] shop and went in there and the guy
[2:06:45] behind the counter, he said, "Can I help
[2:06:47] you?" And Matt said, "Well, I know
[2:06:48] you're a gun dealer. You're also a pawn
[2:06:50] shop owner here." He said, "Uh, have you
[2:06:52] have you got a contender, a 410
[2:06:54] contender?" And the guy started
[2:06:55] laughing. He said,
[2:06:58] "That's funny."
[2:07:01] Kind of looked over. He said, "A
[2:07:03] contender is hard to find."
[2:07:08] I just kind of stood there for a second.
[2:07:10] He said, "They're hard to find." He
[2:07:13] said, "They're rare."
[2:07:15] He said, "They're really valuable."
[2:07:19] He said, "They're really sought after,
[2:07:21] but they're hard to find." He said, "But
[2:07:24] you know what? You can find one
[2:07:27] somewhere."
[2:07:30] Folks, Matt set out on a Brother Matt
[2:07:33] set out on a hunt to find one. And he
[2:07:35] found one. And I said, "You know what?
[2:07:38] I'm I'm Brother David. I'm I'm going to
[2:07:39] prove this guy up there in West
[2:07:41] Virginia. Don't know what he's talking
[2:07:42] about. So, [music] I still live in
[2:07:43] Tennessee. So, I went down to my buddy's
[2:07:44] gun shop and I walked in. I said, "Hey,
[2:07:46] I'm looking for a contender." He said,
[2:07:47] "You [laughter]
[2:07:49] can't find them. They're hard to find."
[2:07:53] I said, "Really?" He said, "Yeah." He
[2:07:55] told me the prices and value of them and
[2:07:56] everything. He said, "You can't find
[2:07:57] them." He said, "If you find one, you
[2:07:59] are a blessed man." Two days later, he
[2:08:02] called me. He said, "You ain't going to
[2:08:03] believe it."
[2:08:05] He said, "You know what? Somebody just
[2:08:07] come in here and traded one in." He
[2:08:08] said, "If you want it, you can come get
[2:08:09] it."
[2:08:11] He said, "They told me they were going
[2:08:12] on to better things, better guns." I
[2:08:14] said, "Hold that. I'm coming to get it."
[2:08:17] C Can I tell y'all something? A
[2:08:20] contender is hard to find
[2:08:23] &gt;&gt; for the faith.
[2:08:25] &gt;&gt; They're rare,
[2:08:27] &gt;&gt; but they're valuable.
[2:08:31] &gt;&gt; And no matter how rare they are, and no
[2:08:32] matter how hard they are to find,
[2:08:35] &gt;&gt; I found some today.
[2:08:38] Hallelujah.
[2:08:39] &gt;&gt; I found some today.
[2:08:41] &gt;&gt; I found some real Christians that will
[2:08:42] contend with that devil
[2:08:45] &gt;&gt; and maintain their position in Christ.
[2:08:47] &gt;&gt; Listen, Satan, be careful. This is not
[2:08:52] that first Eve.
[2:08:54] &gt;&gt; This is a word for word formed bride.
[2:08:58] &gt;&gt; She knows who she is. She knows what she
[2:09:00] believes
[2:09:01] &gt;&gt; and she knows where she's standing. I
[2:09:03] wonder today how many say, "Lord,
[2:09:04] [music] I want to get some of those
[2:09:05] vitamins."
[2:09:06] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:09:07] &gt;&gt; I want to be a contender.
[2:09:08] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:09:09] &gt;&gt; Lord, don't ever let the serpent hiss
[2:09:11] over my life.
[2:09:13] &gt;&gt; Don't ever let the serpent seduce me in
[2:09:16] what I believe and what my convictions
[2:09:17] are. May we bow our hearts this morning.
[2:09:22] Contenders are rare. They're hard to
[2:09:24] find, but they can be found.
[2:09:28] I wonder today how many say, "Lord, I
[2:09:30] don't want to be an arguer of this
[2:09:32] message. I want to be a contender for
[2:09:34] it. I don't want to be a fusser and a
[2:09:37] fighter of this word that's been given.
[2:09:41] I want to be a contender.
[2:09:43] I want to I want to debate that devil. I
[2:09:46] don't want to I I want to I want to
[2:09:47] exercise authority just like Michael did
[2:09:51] when he stood there toe-to-toe with the
[2:09:52] devil. He didn't scream at him and
[2:09:55] didn't get all emotionally worked up and
[2:09:57] falling apart and egotistic and
[2:10:00] arrogant, but he just stood there and
[2:10:01] said, "The Lord rebuke thee." I wonder
[2:10:03] today if there be somebody say, "Lord,
[2:10:05] that's the kind of courage I want. I
[2:10:08] want to be a job, Lord. Lord, I want to
[2:10:10] be that person that when the devil and
[2:10:13] you have a debate and the devil says,
[2:10:14] "Listen, there ain't nobody can live
[2:10:15] that message. There ain't nobody going
[2:10:18] to continue in the things that William
[2:10:19] Brandham taught. There ain't nobody
[2:10:21] going to stand for them kind of
[2:10:22] convictions. There ain't no young people
[2:10:24] on that earth that's going to stand for
[2:10:26] them kind of standards of holiness and
[2:10:28] modesty and clean living. There's nobody
[2:10:30] down there that'll do it. How many say,
[2:10:32] "Lord, I want to be your job. I want to
[2:10:35] be that one that you can point to and
[2:10:37] say, "But I've got a son here in Black
[2:10:39] Rock, Arkansas. I've got a daughter down
[2:10:41] there in Arkansas. I've got a I've got a
[2:10:43] young man there. I've got a young lady
[2:10:44] there. I've got a I've got a I've got a
[2:10:46] group of young people scattered all over
[2:10:48] the world standing for these
[2:10:49] convictions.
[2:10:51] I wonder today how many say, "Lord, let
[2:10:53] me be that one. I want to maintain my
[2:10:56] position."
[2:10:58] Now, if you're going to have victory,
[2:11:00] you got to stay aligned with God's word.
[2:11:02] Spiritual victory comes from alignment
[2:11:06] with the word of God.
[2:11:08] Almighty God, we bow our hearts in your
[2:11:10] presence today. Father, I believe I'm
[2:11:12] speaking privilegedly here today,
[2:11:14] speaking to contenders.
[2:11:17] Father, they're not departers.
[2:11:19] They've not given into seducing spirits
[2:11:21] and doctrines of devils. They've not
[2:11:24] been given over to reprobate minds
[2:11:26] concerning the faith, the truth. But
[2:11:29] Lord, they're just ordinary people,
[2:11:30] common people.
[2:11:32] But Lord, they found their place in
[2:11:34] scripture. They found their position in
[2:11:37] the word of life and they're standing on
[2:11:39] it. Now Lord, they've got many troubles
[2:11:41] and many of them are perplexed. They're
[2:11:44] at the crossroads. Don't know what to
[2:11:45] do. Don't know where to turn. Going
[2:11:46] through this situation, maybe facing
[2:11:48] this you, facing this problem, maybe
[2:11:50] maybe things that seem seem impossible,
[2:11:53] but Lord, they're contenders. So they're
[2:11:56] perplexed, but they're not in despair.
[2:11:58] They're not under enough pressure to
[2:12:00] renounce all their hope. Father, they're
[2:12:02] standing here today, some of them tired
[2:12:04] and weary in spirit, but Lord, they're
[2:12:06] contending now. Father, I pray today for
[2:12:09] a grace upon the lives of these
[2:12:10] contenders.
[2:12:12] Lord, maybe today by the preaching of
[2:12:14] your word, they could leave with a
[2:12:15] different outlook on who they are. Maybe
[2:12:18] they've just looked at themselves as
[2:12:19] human beings or church members or
[2:12:21] members of Grace Tabernacle. But Lord,
[2:12:24] may they leave here today and get in
[2:12:25] this word and realize, I'm a contender.
[2:12:28] I'm not an arguer. I'm not a fusser. I'm
[2:12:31] not a fighter, but I am a contender. and
[2:12:34] my life will challenge the devil to a
[2:12:36] debate and I'll stand there as a son and
[2:12:39] daughter of God and say, "Satan, you
[2:12:41] know the word." The Bible says this and
[2:12:44] the Bible says that and the prophet of
[2:12:45] God taught that and I stand upon it.
[2:12:48] Father, give us give us give us lives
[2:12:50] here today that are built on
[2:12:52] convictions.
[2:12:54] They're not built on the shifting sands
[2:12:55] of man's ideas. And they're not built on
[2:12:58] the on the mood and the atmosphere of a
[2:13:00] church, but they're built on wordbased
[2:13:02] convictions. Father, we're fixing to
[2:13:04] close out an old year and go into a new
[2:13:06] year. Lord, I pray, dear God. I pray,
[2:13:10] Lord, may we may we close out this old
[2:13:13] year as we take these last few days of
[2:13:15] this old year. And Lord, may we do
[2:13:17] inventory, Father. Lord, may we may we
[2:13:20] allow your word to to do our our [music]
[2:13:23] yearly inventory, Father, where we're
[2:13:26] lacking, Lord. May you bring it to our
[2:13:27] attention, Lord, where we need to
[2:13:29] tighten up. May you bring it to our
[2:13:31] attention, Lord, where maybe the hiss of
[2:13:33] the serpent is coming in in our home or
[2:13:36] in our family or in our relationship or
[2:13:38] in the activities we're doing. And Lord,
[2:13:40] the hiss of the serpent is deteriorating
[2:13:42] our testimony and we not even got the
[2:13:45] courage to stand up against it. Father,
[2:13:47] may you give us that courage.
[2:13:49] Lord, we don't want to be just church
[2:13:51] members. We want to be contenders
[2:13:54] in the name of Jesus Christ.
[2:13:57] With every head bowed, every eye closed,
[2:13:59] I wonder right now, just you and the
[2:14:01] Lord, [music] maybe you say, "Father,
[2:14:05] you just raise your hand. Say, Lord,
[2:14:06] come by my way. Lord, I know you're
[2:14:09] moving all over this building and I know
[2:14:10] you're dealing with hearts, but but come
[2:14:12] by my heart and do inventory right now.
[2:14:16] Check my heart. Check my life. Check my
[2:14:19] standing with you. Am I am I where I
[2:14:22] need to be? Am I strong in areas? Or am
[2:14:25] I getting weak? Am I getting relaxed? Am
[2:14:27] I am I am I am I allowing the hiss of
[2:14:30] the serpent to come in and to begin to
[2:14:33] hiss over my family?
[2:14:35] Oh God, give me that conviction. Lord,
[2:14:39] Lord, align my life with your word. I
[2:14:42] wonder today, how many young people here
[2:14:43] under the sound of my voice and under
[2:14:45] the opices of this word today can say,
[2:14:48] Lord, I want you to take my life and I
[2:14:51] want you to align my life with your
[2:14:52] word. I don't want you to take the word
[2:14:55] and align it with my life. I want you to
[2:14:57] take my [music] life.
[2:14:59] &gt;&gt; I don't want to I don't want to I don't
[2:15:00] want to argue with this devil no more. I
[2:15:03] don't want to fuss with this devil no
[2:15:04] more. [music] I'm tired of arguing with
[2:15:06] that devil. You said, "But how do I
[2:15:08] argue with him?" Well, devil, I don't
[2:15:10] know. I just can't overcome. And I just
[2:15:11] can't give this up. And I go to church
[2:15:13] and I go to youth camp and I go to this
[2:15:15] convention and I go to this meet and I
[2:15:16] get real touched and I come right back.
[2:15:18] But if you if you'll move today from
[2:15:20] just being an arguer into becoming a
[2:15:23] contender and stand toe-to-toe with that
[2:15:26] devil on the on the foundation of the
[2:15:28] word of God,
[2:15:30] you'll overcome him.
[2:15:33] Hallelujah.
[2:15:35] Hallelujah.
[2:15:40] Hallelujah.
[2:15:43] Oh, just you and the Lord right now.
[2:15:46] You want to raise your hands before him?
[2:15:51] I believe it. [singing]

[2:21:34] I receive [singing]
[2:21:36] it.
[2:21:37] &gt;&gt; How many this morning say, Lord, I
[2:21:38] receive it. I wonder right now this
[2:21:41] morning, how many how many will just
[2:21:43] look at that devil right now in this in
[2:21:45] this Sunday morning worship service
[2:21:48] and
[2:21:48] &gt;&gt; you'll say, "Satan,
[2:21:50] I challenge you to a bait right now.
[2:21:53] &gt;&gt; I [music] challenge you to a debate
[2:21:55] right now. You've told me I can't be
[2:21:57] healed." I challenge you right now to a
[2:21:59] debate.
[2:22:00] &gt;&gt; Isaiah 53 said, "By his stripes, I'm
[2:22:02] healed." You said, "I can't be saved." I
[2:22:06] challenge you to a debate.
[2:22:07] [singing and music]
[2:22:08] The Holy Ghost is here. I'm an heir of
[2:22:10] salvation.
[2:22:12] &gt;&gt; See, I've done my part.
[2:22:15] &gt;&gt; I've preached the word.
[2:22:17] &gt;&gt; Now, you do your part and believe the
[2:22:18] word. [music]
[2:22:19] &gt;&gt; And brother said, this time of the
[2:22:21] service right now, this little this
[2:22:22] little section after the word goes
[2:22:24] forth, he said, "Now, this is God's part
[2:22:26] of the service."
[2:22:28] &gt;&gt; He said, "This is when God comes in and
[2:22:30] begins to confirm things."
[2:22:32] &gt;&gt; How many can testify in atmospheres like
[2:22:34] this, you've experienced the
[2:22:35] transformation [music] of God?
[2:22:37] See, right now is not the time to worry
[2:22:39] about what time it is or where you're
[2:22:40] going to go or what you're going. Right
[2:22:42] now is the time to let that word begin
[2:22:43] to find a place to root in your life.
[2:22:47] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:22:52] &gt;&gt; I believe it.
[2:22:57] &gt;&gt; So I lift my hands
[2:23:01] toward [music and singing] the heaven.
[2:23:04] I lift my eyes where my help comes from.
[2:23:11] I look to you,
[2:23:14] my [singing] rock, my healer.
[2:23:17] I trust in [music] you.
[2:23:23] So I lift my hands
[2:23:27] toward the heaven.
[2:23:30] I lift my [singing and music] eyes where
[2:23:33] my help comes from.
[2:23:36] I look to you,
[2:23:40] my rock, [music and singing] my healer.
[2:23:43] I trust in you.
[2:23:47] [singing]
[2:23:49] Oh, healing is here.
[2:23:53] [singing]
[2:23:56] [music]
[2:23:56] Healing is here.
[2:24:03] Healing [singing]

[2:28:38] Amen. You believe that this morning?
[2:28:41] Amen. While the spirit of the Lord is
[2:28:42] moving and dealing with our hearts, how
[2:28:45] many can say, "I'm a true contender."
[2:28:48] &gt;&gt; Amen. Contending for the faith. Amen.
[2:28:52] What a tremendous message to remind us
[2:28:55] who we are. Amen. You know, I we hear
[2:28:58] that word a lot. It's used the contender
[2:29:01] in many different v venues and different
[2:29:06] things. You know, I was thinking when
[2:29:08] brother Andrew was preaching that and
[2:29:10] [music]
[2:29:11] you know, in the in the sports world,
[2:29:13] they say uh there's all kinds of teams,
[2:29:15] but the contenders are those that have a
[2:29:18] potential to win the prize.
[2:29:21] &gt;&gt; They say they're contenders.
[2:29:23] You know what it means, brother Jared?
[2:29:25] in a in the football world, a contender,
[2:29:27] it's one that had a good offensive line,
[2:29:29] that had the ability to push their way
[2:29:33] and push the enemy out of the way and
[2:29:36] had quarterback that had the presence of
[2:29:38] mind to be aware [music] of the the
[2:29:40] pocket and all the dangers that were
[2:29:42] around them and wide receivers that
[2:29:45] could run.
[2:29:46] They had people in every position
[2:29:49] that had the ability to [music] to do
[2:29:52] things greater than their enemy or their
[2:29:55] opponent. And that made him a real
[2:29:57] contender. In other words, to be a
[2:29:59] contender, it means it was one that had
[2:30:02] had the qualities [music] that were
[2:30:04] necessary for victory. And I thought as
[2:30:07] he was preaching that, that's what a
[2:30:08] contender really is. It's those that
[2:30:10] have the qualities that are necessary
[2:30:12] for victory. For in the end there is a
[2:30:15] victor. [music]
[2:30:16] &gt;&gt; In the end there's a victor. And you
[2:30:18] know what? Even those contenders when
[2:30:19] they talk about him a contender, they
[2:30:21] still lose games. They still lose
[2:30:23] battles. They have bad they have bad
[2:30:25] times. They [music] have down times.
[2:30:26] They sometimes they feel defeated.
[2:30:28] Sometimes they had to have a a good
[2:30:30] coach come by just to pick them up to
[2:30:32] remind them who they are. I think that's
[2:30:34] what God done this morning. Come by to
[2:30:35] say, "You're a contender.
[2:30:37] &gt;&gt; You have the qualities. You possess the
[2:30:39] qualities that are necessary for
[2:30:41] victory. And in the end, there will
[2:30:43] [applause] be a victor. You're a true
[2:30:44] contender. It doesn't matter what you
[2:30:47] heard or or what you how down you got or
[2:30:50] how low you get, you're still a
[2:30:52] contender.
[2:30:53] &gt;&gt; Amen. I don't know about you, but that
[2:30:54] does something for my heart this morning
[2:30:56] for God to come by and remind you that
[2:30:58] you're a contender of the faith. We're
[2:31:00] not pretenders. We're contenders.
[2:31:02] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:31:03] &gt;&gt; There's a whole world of pretenders, but
[2:31:04] we ain't pretenders this morning. We're
[2:31:06] contenders. That's what the devil says
[2:31:07] you are. You're a pretender. How many
[2:31:09] looked the devil in the eye and say,
[2:31:10] "I'm not a pretender.
[2:31:11] &gt;&gt; I'm a contender." Say, "How do you know
[2:31:13] it?" Cuz the greatest analyst that there
[2:31:15] ever was. Said, "Look down in my heart
[2:31:18] and in my life and said, "They possess
[2:31:20] the qualities it takes for victory."
[2:31:22] &gt;&gt; There ain't nobody that could look at a
[2:31:23] life like God can. And he looked at your
[2:31:25] life and said, "You have the qualities
[2:31:27] that it takes."
[2:31:28] &gt;&gt; Amen. You're a contender this morning.
[2:31:30] [music] Amen. You love the Lord. Won't
[2:31:32] you give the Lord a hand clap of praise
[2:31:34] this morning? [applause]
[2:31:36] &gt;&gt; Isn't it wonderful just to know who you
[2:31:38] are?
[2:31:39] We're not just wondering. [applause]
[2:31:41] &gt;&gt; We're not wondering. Said, "The devil
[2:31:43] [music] wondered, but Jesus knew."
[2:31:45] &gt;&gt; We're not just wondering who we are. I
[2:31:47] know who I am.
[2:31:48] &gt;&gt; Amen. I appreciate our brethren. [music]
[2:31:50] That's just like sitting down and
[2:31:52] talking to the Lord. Amen.
[2:31:53] &gt;&gt; Just reminding you who you are. Can we
[2:31:55] try that song? Just a little talk with
[2:31:57] Jesus.
[2:31:58] &gt;&gt; Amen. You love the Lord this morning.
[2:32:00] Amen. Just remember our service at
[2:32:03] Wednesday night having our uh end of the
[2:32:05] year service. Uh, Brother Andrew will be
[2:32:07] speaking for us and and if this was
[2:32:09] [music] anything uh to do with the uh he
[2:32:12] said this was part one, that's part two.
[2:32:14] I can't wait to hear the I can't wait to
[2:32:16] hear the evangelist come out there on on
[2:32:18] Wednesday night. And [music] uh Brother
[2:32:20] Matt McGary and his family are coming
[2:32:21] down and fellowship with us. I know we
[2:32:23] have several coming to be a part of the
[2:32:25] service. We're cooking a breakfast for
[2:32:27] everyone. We're not doing a watch night
[2:32:29] service. So the service will be at
[2:32:31] normal time at 7 o'clock.
[2:32:33] &gt;&gt; [music]
[2:32:33] &gt;&gt; Um what that means is that we don't have
[2:32:35] intention of being at church until
[2:32:37] midnight. So that's not what our goal
[2:32:40] is. We but uh but we just we're going to
[2:32:42] come and just have church. So uh you
[2:32:45] know whatever happens happens. We don't
[2:32:47] ever put a limit on God.
[2:32:49] &gt;&gt; Amen. We're just coming to have church
[2:32:50] Wednesday night. So how many's going to
[2:32:52] come and join us uh to bring in the new
[2:32:54] year? I can't think of a better place to
[2:32:55] be. When I was in the world, you know,
[2:32:58] everybody wanted to go down to the club
[2:33:00] or to the to the bar or to the party and
[2:33:02] all this stuff to bring in the new year.
[2:33:04] And then and most of the time them
[2:33:06] crazies didn't remember what it was like
[2:33:08] bringing in the new year. And I thought,
[2:33:09] you know what? That's where that's the
[2:33:11] way I want to be tomorrow or Wednesday
[2:33:12] night. I don't even want to remember
[2:33:13] what it was like when I brought in the
[2:33:15] new year. But it ain't because I'm drunk
[2:33:16] on the spirits of the world, but I want
[2:33:18] to be so filled with the Holy Ghost that
[2:33:20] I didn't even know what took place.
[2:33:22] &gt;&gt; Amen. And I think we may as well just
[2:33:23] come and have church and put the old
[2:33:25] year behind us and bring in a new year
[2:33:27] and go on and be a contender in 2026.
[2:33:31] Amen. You love the Lord. Let's just sing
[2:33:33] this together. Well, I once was lost in
