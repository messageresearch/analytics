He said, "Because God loves to go to church, and God loves to worship." So if you got God on the inside of you, there's something in you that can't keep you out of the house of God.

It's hard to mix all that and read the words and all at the same time, but we just love the Lord and love some good singing and sure appreciate Brother David and and the gift that God has given him. And I'd love to back him up. Amen. Amen. We just appreciate the Lord. Amen. How many's looking forward to the word of God tonight? Amen. We have a prayer request for for Weston and Owen as they're sick. Also, brother Jared's boys, Warren and Barrett, and also for brother Randall and Sister Joyce. Been just a a need in their life. Also, Sister Anna Alexander has an unspoken prayer request for her family. I believe that God is certainly mindful to know what we have need of. And he knows every situation, amen, that's going on. And I know that that the Lord is able to certainly, you know, some things seem impossible. And without God, they are. Some things you don't have an answer to. You wouldn't have a a direction, have no advice or anything to give. But without the hand of God, it's an impossible situation. But I believe that God is a God of the impossible. Amen. And I know that you say, "Well, brother Matt, what's that mean?" You know, sometimes we just have to let God do what God does. And sometimes that don't feel good to us because you can't you leave your own emotions in it and your own feelings. And you just have to let all that go aside and let God do what God does. And I think the worst mistakes I've ever been in in my life is trying to fix things myself and got in the way of God or or ahead of God and trying to uh force things to happen a certain way and it's such a a dangerous place to be in and you know it just causes a lot of uh trouble and anxiety in your spirit and but we can just when we can just uh be still and let God fight our ba battles and you know the Bible says they that wait upon the Lord shall renew their strength. Amen. Fighting and it just takes you down to where you have nothing left. But when we can just wait on God, I believe our strength will be renewed. And not only that, but I believe our joy will be renewed. Our our our our uh revival, our our hope, everything is renewed when we can just allow God to come in and intervene. And so, I just believe that God is able to do that tonight. I also want to remember sister Lily and I went by and visited her and her family today and uh and just asked the Lord to touch her body and uh she's not able to get around and so we just believe that God is a is a supernatural God. Uh he's able to do things that we don't have the ability to do. And so we just want to rely on him. And maybe just ask you tonight and maybe somebody has something on their heart that you just like to put before the Lord. And you say, "Brother Matt, I you know, I've been trying to fix this or that, but maybe tonight if you just lift your hand to the Lord and just say, Lord, I just want to give it to you and just relax in your presence and in your word tonight and just allow you uh to come in and intercede on my behalf." Let's just bow our heads together. Gracious heavenly father, Lord, we are so privileged, Lord, to know you. And Lord, to know how that we are your children, Lord. And so many times in the Bible, Lord, we read about and we're reminded that we are not forsaken. We're not forgotten. And Lord, it doesn't matter how hopeless the things that we face, Lord, are. And sometimes, Lord, that just don't seem to be an answer, Lord. And we just try in our own flesh, in our own mind, Lord. And but God, we just believe that you're more than able tonight, Lord. And I know that when we don't have an answer and Lord, we don't have anywhere to turn, Lord. You told us in your word that we could call upon you in a time of trouble, Lord. And you would hear our prayer and you would help. And Lord, we just ask you tonight, Lord. I know many trials, Lord, many great needs here tonight, Lord. And Lord, I just ask you tonight, Lord, that you would intervene. Lord, I pray, Lord, that you would come among your children, Lord. Let your spirit be able to minister to every heart. And Lord, I pray that every need would be met. Lord, I'm that kind of believer. Lord, I don't just come believing that you might just show up and help one person or help uh somebody maybe a far off, but Lord, I believe that you're that kind of a God, Lord, that can come in this building tonight. Lord, that you could help every situation. Lord, you could further us in your word. Lord, you can take things that seem completely hopeless, hopeless, and Lord, in just a few moments, you can turn all of it around. And Lord, we just ask you, Lord, that by your spirit, Lord, that we could just relax in your presence, Lord, and allow you to have your way in this church service tonight. And Lord, may we leave this place knowing that you've been in our midst, Lord. And we'll give you the glory for all that you do. We ask these things in the name of Jesus Christ, we pray. Amen. Amen. How many believe that tonight? &gt;&gt; Amen. I certainly believe that God is more than able. Can we sing uh the goodness of God? Amen. We're just looking forward to what brother Joe coming tonight and just ask the Lord to have his way in the service. Amen. I love you, Lord, for your mercy never fails me. And all my days I've been held in your hands. From the moment that I wake up till I lay my head, I will sing of the goodness of God. [Music] Cuz all my life you have been faithful. And all my life you have been so so good. With every breath that I am able, well, I will sing of the goodness of God. [Music] I will sing of the goodness of God. I love your voice. You have led me through the fire in the darkest night. You're close like no other. I've known you as a father, known you as a friend. I have lived in the goodness of God. How many can testify about that tonight? For I know all my life you have been faithful. And all my life you have been so so good. With every breath that I am aable, I feel [Music] of the goodness of God. [Music] All my life you have been so so good. Every breath that I am able. Oh, I will sing of the goodness of God.

Certainly, he's been a good father. &gt;&gt; He's been an everpresent help in a time of trouble. &gt;&gt; He's never one time forsaken me. I've let him down many times, but he's never let me down one time. &gt;&gt; Oh, don't that want you make you want to praise the Lord tonight? Amen. Men can fail you, but God can never fail you. Amen. And if we could just look past individualities and people's personalities and realize there's a mighty God that's felt before us and look around, you're it. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Don't you love him? Won't you give the Lord a hand clap of praise? Little course been on my heart just today. It's early. Well, while I was praying, somebody touch me.

And if you have a need upon your heart, won't you make it known to the Lord? I know he's more than able to meet each and every one of our needs this evening. Lord Jesus, we thank you, Lord, for such a time as this. Father, we come and worship you in spirit and truth. Father, we come to magnify your name, Lord. Lord God, what a what an atmosphere, Lord God, as believers come together and join their licks of fire together, Lord, to hear from heaven, hear from home, Lord. We've we've been out in the world, Lord, working and shopping and Lord God, embracing humanity, Lord God. And it such darkness in this age, as the prophet of God said, the lid has been pulled off of hell. There's thousands upon thousands of demons that's been released out of the river Euphrates, Lord. But here we are tonight gathering together in Grace Tabernacle, Lord, one more time, Lord, to worship you tonight. give you honor, give you praise, give you glory, Lord. Lord, let's open the windows of heaven, Lord, and pour out among us, Lord, this evening exactly what our heart has desire of, Lord God. We commit this time into your hands, Lord. We pray that you'll anoint us aresh, Lord, that you'd just intercede in every situation here tonight. every every heart that's burdened down with the pressures of life. Lord, I pray that you'd be a burden bearer tonight unto them. Lord, through the ministering of the word, Lord, I pray that you to heal the sick and afflicted. Lord, encourage those that may be down. Lord, we're looking forward to having a good time in the word tonight. Lord God, as we commit this time into your hands in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ, and the bride says, &gt;&gt; "Amen." God bless you. If you got your Bibles, I invite you to Ephesians chapter 6. It's good to be in the house of the Lord tonight. And &gt;&gt; Amen. Just feel like the the Lord's been richly moving among us. And &gt;&gt; wow, I just uh would say tonight, I think we've got some of the cream of the crop and &gt;&gt; man, baptisms and my just rededications and &gt;&gt; new saints coming to the Lord. I say the move is on. I say we uh I believe the message of an hour has produced some of the best men of God to preach the gospel. &gt;&gt; Amen. We're thankful to have a few here at the Grace Tabernacle and &gt;&gt; gives their life to to preach the gospel, give their life to hear, to labor among us and it's good to to to rub shoulders with people that love Jesus Christ and is not looking for fame or fortune, but looking to push the battle and push somebody to closer to heaven. That's what it's all about. And I think uh this world is trying to pull us down, but as brother Mark says, I'm going to rise rise above it all. I I just feel like the move is on in our hearts. Even if we have bad days, I believe the move is still on. It never hinders what the Lord Jesus is doing among us. &gt;&gt; Amen. We may fall short. We might miss the mark sometimes, but Jesus Christ never misses the mark. &gt;&gt; He's got everything under control. if we would just put our trust in him tonight. &gt;&gt; Don't worry about financial problems. Don't worry about church problems. Don't worry about family issues. Just put our trust in God. Cuz we're trusting a God that never fails. He's never late. He's always on time. He's got everything under control. Nothing happens. It's the intelligence of Almighty God. He knows every time a flea bats his eyes. &gt;&gt; He knew exactly who would be at church service tonight. He knew exactly what songs would sing. We're talking about a mighty God tonight that's got everything under control. &gt;&gt; Amen. Well, God bless you. Ephesians chapter 6:10 says, "Finally, my brethren, be strong in the Lord and the power of his might, &gt;&gt; his ability. &gt;&gt; Put on the whole armor of God that you may be able to stand against the ws of the devil." It's coming. For we wrestle not against flesh and blood, but against principalities, against powers, against rulers of darkness of this world, against spiritual wickedness in high places. Wherefore take unto you the whole armor of God, that you may be able to withstand in the evil day, and having done all to stand. He says, "Stand therefore having your loins gird about with truth and having it on the breastplate of righteousness as a defense, putting on the breastplate of righteousness, your feet with the preparation of the gospel of peace. Above all, take the shield of faith, wherewith you shall be able to quench all the fiery darks of the wicked, and take the helmet of salvation, and the sword of the spirit, which is the word of God. Amen. God bless you. You can have your seats tonight. We realize it's an age of such confusion. It's an age of such darkness. And we realize, as I said in our prayer, that the lid of hell's been opened up. And all the demons out of the river Euphrates has been released in our day and age against the believers and the the church of the living God. And we know our nation's treaties. There's peace. There's rumors of wars. And there's a great shakening. Brother man would tell us there's a great shakening. The UN is shaken. Everything is shaken. The Bible said it would be like that. He said everything that could be shook would be shook. But we receive a kingdom that cannot be shook. &gt;&gt; Everything is shaking. Are you hearing me tonight? Everything around us, brother Morgan. Amen. You're you might think that you got the best job and you got financial security. You can wake up in the morning, your bank account can be empty, your house could be gone, your vehicles could be gone. Amen. Just in a moment of time, everything can stop in this world. Amen. And I believe that's what brother Brown was trying to explain to us here. The world is falling apart. There's no there's no continuing city here. Amen. there. There's no security here. There's no refuge here. You can may feel good under a good banking account. I know it feels good to be financial stable. Amen. Where you're not wondering where your next meal's coming from. Amen. But that's all natural. And that's here today and gone tomorrow. Amen. It's all shaken. Amen. I don't care how much you believe that everything's going to be all right in this life in the natural. Amen. Your tomorrow can be all broken up. Your tomorrow could be broken into a shambles and depression or nervousness or amen. It's just the neotic age that we're living in. Amen. Darkness has such grip the age that we're living in. He said everything could be shocking but we got a kingdom that cannot be shook. Everything is s uncertain. The seasons are uncertain. This world is falling apart. He said, "But there's anything that is certain." &gt;&gt; Come on. &gt;&gt; He says, "Yes." Hallelujah. He says, "There's something that's positive." He said, Jesus said, "Both heavens and earth will pass away, but my word shall never." There's something that is certain. Heavens are will pass away, but my word shall never pass away. He said that is what is certain. The Bible don't give an uncertain sound. It identifies the characteristics of our God and its sounding or its revealing. And as we read Ephesians, he said, "Finally, my brother, be strong in the Lord &gt;&gt; and in the power of not your ability or brother Matt's ability, our church, our religion, &gt;&gt; but he said, but in the power of his might or his ability, &gt;&gt; put on the whole armor of God &gt;&gt; that you'll be able to stand against the ws of the enemy." Come on. &gt;&gt; In other words, for the man is saying, "Amen." He was stating here in a vision, the enemy's coming in like a flood. &gt;&gt; Amen. There's going to be a day of great darkness. There's going to be a day of great gloom and doom. &gt;&gt; He said, "But put on the armor of God that you may be able to stand. &gt;&gt; Wrestle not against flesh and blood, but against principalities." In other words, wrestle against hell and all of his demons. Wherefore take on the whole armor of God that you may be able to withstand. &gt;&gt; And then he said, having on the breastplate, &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; of righteousness. &gt;&gt; Oh, I don't believe we're a bunch of cowards tonight. I don't believe we're just a a wishywashy believers tonight. Amen. Coming to church and fulfill a duty or ritual. Amen. We're not a bunch of cowards. If you'll notice here, Amen. There's no uh defense on the back of a believer. Amen. Because our commission is to speak and move forward. &gt;&gt; Amen. Put on the breastplate. He said take on the shield of faith that you'll be able to quench all the fiery darts of the wicked. Amen. Put on a shield. Put on some defense shield. Put on a helmet. Something to protect you. &gt;&gt; Something that could be your defense. He's telling you there going to be punches. There's going to be fiery darts. There's going to be a Every gun of hell is pointing at a believer. And matter of fact, it's shooting at every one of us tonight. When you get up in the morning, hell never rest. Hell never sleeps. Hell is out to torment you, hunt at your windows, peck at your door, been run you, chase you, trying to break you down, Brother David. But he's telling us here, put on the breastplate. Put on the helmet. Put on put on the shield of faith. &gt;&gt; And he said the sword of the spirit. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; The only part of this is actually offense. Offense is take the sword of God. Take the sword of the spirit which is the word of God. The word there comes from remma. It's an utterance. It's a living voice. It It's a message. It's a narrative concerning some occurrence or living voice for immediate situations right now. I thank God tonight, Brother Joe. We serve a God. He's present right now.

The word is he. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; John 15:7 says, "If you abide in me and my words abide in you, you shall ask whatever you will and it shall be done unto you." &gt;&gt; This word here means remma also. It dwells. It continues. It's not to depart. It's present word that continues. Are you with me for a moment? We'd like to minister tonight just for a few moments on the bride's arsenal. &gt;&gt; Amen. Look at this for a moment. Amen. It tells you, Amen. Take the sword of the spirit. &gt;&gt; Amen.

He's a right now God. Amen. And then that's what Paul was saying. Take the word. Amen. Let the word live and roll in your life. &gt;&gt; It's present word. &gt;&gt; Brother would say it like this. The transforming power of God that's taken us from the chaos of science and education and the things of the world and the understanding of the modern day has transformed us now into sons and daughters of God. Even death itself can never hold us in the grave. &gt;&gt; We'll be changed in the moment in a twinkling of an eye. &gt;&gt; Oh church, the grave, where is your victory? Death, where is your sting? We got a revelation tonight, church. Amen. We may, Sister Martha, we may take our last breath on this earth. They may lay us in a ground somewhere, &gt;&gt; but when you take your last breath, remma word never dies. &gt;&gt; There's no ceasing to the Rema word that's been placed in our bosom. &gt;&gt; Oh, I'm here to tell you, you might not be able to hear that trumpet sound with a natural ear. Amen. You'll be laying there dormant, this body going back to the dust. But all of a sudden, There's a shout and a voice and a trump of God, &gt;&gt; church, they can bury us in the ground. They can bury us at sea. Amen. When that trumpet sounds, Amen. our ears are going to hear. Amen. And we're going to respond to the call. It's not by the natural ears. It's by the rema word. It's a sword of God. Amen. It's even working when we don't even realize it's working. Hallelujah. He said, "I am the resurrection and life. &gt;&gt; He that believeth in me, though he was dead, yet shall he live. And whosoever liveth and believeth of me shall never die. &gt;&gt; There is no way to stop the living word of God." &gt;&gt; Brother Brian, they can put you in a casket. They can bury you six foot under. &gt;&gt; Amen. But they can never stop the living word of God. Death can't stop it. Hell can't stop it. Feelings can't stop it. Churches can't stop it. &gt;&gt; And the quote goes on, it's got to rise again. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Amen. No matter what they do to this body. Amen. Look at us tonight, church. Amen.

Just to let go &gt;&gt; and speak his word in season. &gt;&gt; You speak the word &gt;&gt; and I will perform it. &gt;&gt; That is my covenant. There you go. There is That's my covenant and it can never fail. You speak the word and I will perform it. &gt;&gt; Christ is the energy or the exhaustion of power. Brother Bramble said, "Your lips is his lips." &gt;&gt; When you're energized, &gt;&gt; when you're at an exhaustion of power from Almighty God, you he Jesus Christ is the energy. And he said, "You are the show pitcher. &gt;&gt; You are his hands when you're energized. It's not the jawbone. &gt;&gt; It's because Samson was energized. &gt;&gt; There was an extortion of power &gt;&gt; that wasn't a part of Samson. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Actually, Samson was a ruddy fella. &gt;&gt; David was a ruddy fella. &gt;&gt; He wasn't much to look at. But once he got feeling of them locks and he realized I'm covenant, I'm a part of the promise. God cannot fail me. God cannot forsaken me. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. And the enemy was coming in like a flood. Amen. He reached down and picked up an a little jawbone that looked broken down to the world. But when it was placed in a man that was built to possess the gates of his enemy. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Oh, let me tell you something. In the natural, that old jawbone would have broke when it hit the first helmet. But when God when Samson struck by the anointing of Almighty God, it was the energy of Almighty God that was exorting through the hand of mortality. &gt;&gt; Brother Morgan, he bet he be to dent some helmets with an old brittle jawbone of a mule. &gt;&gt; Come on. Oh, it's fanaticism. It always has been. He say still's the same God tonight. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Amen. Samson was the show picture, but God was the energy. &gt;&gt; It was a screen showing that God's not dead. &gt;&gt; He's alive. &gt;&gt; Why is a confession such a powerful weapon? Have I been too long? &gt;&gt; Why is the confession such a powerful weapon? You are transforming the battle. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; You want to live defeated, fight your own battles. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Oh, preach, brother Joe. I believe I am. Amen. You know why? Cuz I have fought tried to fight many of my battles. &gt;&gt; You know what? I find a short end of the deal every time. &gt;&gt; But the most powerful weapon is a committal letting go. That's right. &gt;&gt; And a confession. Amen. Saying what's already been said. Like brother Andrew said, and you transferring the battle. A it's not your battle any longer. There's a ream of word down inside of this clay that begins to speak word in season. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Oh church, there is nothing in this world could defeat this bride walking in thus saith the Lord. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; There's this great show picture. It was God discipline the power of of heaven. &gt;&gt; Brother David Samson beat down a thousand Philistines &gt;&gt; with a jawbone. &gt;&gt; Oh, what a mighty God we serve. &gt;&gt; Amen. Could you imagine what kind of revival that Sansa was in that he could have enough strength to keep pressing the battle? &gt;&gt; Keep pressing the battle. You think a thousand Philistines, a thousand men that Samson handled &gt;&gt; that day. What a great victory. &gt;&gt; But it was a show picture to the world that God is real. God's always going to have a witness. &gt;&gt; And I'm here to tell you in 2025. There's a great picture going on in Lead Ocean. &gt;&gt; Somebody is this playing. &gt;&gt; Somebody's a covenant people. &gt;&gt; Somebody is the bride of Jesus Christ. Somebody is exhorting Christ power. Somebody is speaking remma word &gt;&gt; and of slaying the enemy &gt;&gt; to let this world know the exhaustion of power of God is still real &gt;&gt; and it's still powerful. &gt;&gt; The battle is on. &gt;&gt; He said God dresses his army. He says, "What kind of equipment do we use?" The spirit of the sword. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; He said, "Then brother Brown goes through the progression of bow and arrow, rock and hammer, the the the musket, there comes a Springfield." He says, "And then he it keeps evolving down to atomic weapon." &gt;&gt; He says, "We," he says, "But God at the beginning &gt;&gt; gave his children the atomic weapon." Come on. &gt;&gt; The pinnacle of weapons &gt;&gt; because he's an infinite God. &gt;&gt; It's the intelligence of Almighty God. Seeing there was going to be a conflict, there was going to be a battle, &gt;&gt; God equipped his children with the right kind of ammunition and the right kind of attack and the right kind of everything they have need of that would sweep them not only to revival to revival, church service to church service, but from the Garden of Eden all the way to the rapture. &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. The intelligence of God. He said the right kind of attack. What was it? The word. &gt;&gt; When you got the armor of God on, you can take the sword of God with faith and cut your way through any promises. If sickness stands in your way, cut it away. For the weapons of our warfare are not carnal, but mighty through what? &gt;&gt; God to the pulling down of strongholds. &gt;&gt; He's equipped us &gt;&gt; with the anointing. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. The rema word. &gt;&gt; A living voice. Speak the word. &gt;&gt; And I will perform it. &gt;&gt; What an age of overcoming. &gt;&gt; You're my bride. &gt;&gt; All I am, I give to you. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. I give you my word. I give you my the artillery. I give you the arsenal that will defeat Satan any place, any time, under any condition. Amen. &gt;&gt; It doesn't matter who he is, where he's coming from, or where he's at. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; It will defeat him. Oh, church. I'm telling you, the bride's arsenal. He said, "I'll give you a energy, exorion of power." &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; That's in the age of such darkness, the age of such chatter chatter, age of such depression, age of such oppression. &gt;&gt; Age of funny feelings, age of hatred. &gt;&gt; Come on. &gt;&gt; I'm going to anoint my church with a flying eagle. I'm going to anoint her and equipped her with the right anointing &gt;&gt; for the right age. &gt;&gt; Oh, right in the middle of Satan's Eden, the intelligence of God. I'll anoint my bride with the anointing of a flying eagle. &gt;&gt; Listen, listen. Grace tabernacle. When the devil tries to hunt at your windows and attack you at every corner, attack your body with sickness, attack your spirit with with a spirit of hatred or bitterness, &gt;&gt; hallelujah. We got the anointed of a flying eagle. when it tries to jump on your and attach yourself to your body or attach yourself to your spirit. &gt;&gt; Come on. &gt;&gt; And it'll try to attach and try to grow and try to compound the problem and begin to talk in your ear and try to cause you to be defeated, cause you to lay out of church, cause you to quit church, quit quit hanging around and fellowshipping. What is it? It's the those are you still a Christian? Absolutely. Are you still filled with the Holy Ghost? Absolutely. But something has attached itself to your spirit realm or to your flesh. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; I read a story the other day talking about a crow and how a crow will attach itself to an eagle. And he says that's the only bird, brother Matt, that will actually try to torment an eagle by attaching himself to his back. He'll peck at his neck relentlessly, annoying the eagle. But the eagle stays calm. And the higher the eagle soarses, the thinner the air becomes. And the crow that's attached to the spirit realm or to the body, it can't handle the altitude. Eventually, the grow gas gaps. Oh, that's what I want to do to that devil tonight. Amen. Eventually, amen, your altitude determines your destination. Amen. Your altitude begins to torment the devil. Amen. &gt;&gt; And then you begin to suffocate. &gt;&gt; Oh, is that what we want to do tonight? &gt;&gt; Eventually, the crow gas and loses its strength and power and falls off the eagle. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Not because the eagle attacked. It's because the eagle ascended. &gt;&gt; It just kept going higher. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; They can't follow you forever. Your growth will suffocate their noise. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Let me read a quote. I'm going to close in a minute. But the eagle, I watched him for a few minutes. After a while, he got tired of hearing the chatter chatter. So, it just made one big jump and flopped his wings. &gt;&gt; And he began to flop his wings about three times and he was done beyond the timber. Amen. &gt;&gt; He said, "Oh, he was right up in the timber. He could fly a long ways." But you know what? He never flopped the wings anymore. He just know how to set them. It's the intelligence of God. The Rema word. Every time the wind would come in, he would ride up a little higher. Oh, is that what we're doing, believers, tonight? How many eagles we got in the house? How many crows been attaching theirel to your body? I didn't say attached itself to your soul. It attached himself to your body and your spirit. &gt;&gt; But I'm telling you, come on up higher tonight. &gt;&gt; Our arsenal is the ability to soar where crows can't fly. &gt;&gt; And if you'll keep climbing up higher, that old devil that's been tormenting you and your family will begin to gasp for air. on you begin to torment the tormentor. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. And he says a little higher and he rode away and he started crying. I thought, Lord, I'm going to have another spell. As I looked, there he went and I watched him tell he come just a black dot way up in the air. I say, Lord, isn't it isn't you join this and go join that and flap here and flap there, flop there and flop there from one place and another. It's knowing how to set your wings in the power of faith and fly away &gt;&gt; and leave the earthbound chickm chatter chatter. Days of miracles have passed. They no such thing as a Holy Ghost. It's all nonsense. Chatter, chatter, chatter. The chatter of the crow just that's just worked up. That's just enthusiasm. That's just because you went to church camp. That's just because you're young people and you want to be seen. Oh no. That's chatter, chatter, chatter. He says just set your wings. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Chickens can try, but they can't do it. Amen. &gt;&gt; How many believers do we have in the house tonight? &gt;&gt; Amen. It's not your ability. Brother Al said he just begin to set his wings &gt;&gt; and the living voice of the wind of Yahweh begin to come wings. &gt;&gt; It begin to elevate. &gt;&gt; Oh church, I believe that's just the way it's going on now. &gt;&gt; We're going to keep overcoming. We're going to keep climbing higher. Amen. &gt;&gt; Until we come a black dot way up in the heavenlies somewhere &gt;&gt; and Satan says, "Where did he go? He wasn't was not. He was no more." &gt;&gt; That's the way the rapture is going to take place. It's not what we can do. It's what if we let go. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; I'm going in the rapture. &gt;&gt; I'm going up yonder. &gt;&gt; Let go. Let go. Commit it to God. &gt;&gt; I can't even walk without you. &gt;&gt; Without you, Lord. &gt;&gt; Just keep your wings of faith out. &gt;&gt; Oh, I'm telling you, he's the God that's never failed us one time. You spread your wings and the wind of God will sell under your wings. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. He says that's the way to get so high in the atmospheres of God, God's grace, until you don't even hear the chatter chatter any longer. &gt;&gt; It becomes dead to you, sir. &gt;&gt; You're up in the heavenlies now. An eagle is made a heavenly bird. The eagle is a special built bird. Good l I'm not going to be able to get done tonight. Special built bird. He has to be. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; He has to be because he can fly higher than any other bird. &gt;&gt; I don't want you living here thinking you're nothing tonight, church. I'm here to tell you you're more &gt;&gt; than a conqueror. &gt;&gt; You're an eagle. Amen. &gt;&gt; You're a believer. &gt;&gt; You just need to let go and begin to speak the rema word and let God make this trial a blessing today. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; And he says because now the eagle he could fly higher up up reward spirit and life. A special built bride &gt;&gt; has everything she has need of. &gt;&gt; Oh little bride, it's the exhortion of Christ power elevating you above the fanaticism of this world. &gt;&gt; He's the energy. &gt;&gt; We're the show pitcher. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Say, "I just pick up converters." No, you're a son of God. &gt;&gt; Come on. &gt;&gt; I'm just a fireman. No, you're a son of God. &gt;&gt; I'm just a P. No, you're a son of God. &gt;&gt; I'm just a school teacher. No, I'm a son of God. &gt;&gt; Let me tell you something, church. My God is proud of you. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. Amen. &gt;&gt; He's trying to tell you tonight, those crows that's been attaching to us has reached the point they can't go any farther. &gt;&gt; Amen. He's want to show his strength tonight. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Amen. He wants Oh, &gt;&gt; we just seen it the other day. I watched this on Fox New. Amen. When the Putin got off the plane and the president of Russia got off the plane and met Donald Trump down there and they begin to shake hands and they begin to walk down that red carpet, it wasn't a coincidence that the B2 bomber came flying over. &gt;&gt; It was United States of America wanting to show their strength because that B2 bomber, it can fly around the world and not be seen. But for a moment they let our enemy feel the vibrations and see &gt;&gt; the show of strength. Oh church, I believe that's what's happening in the hour that we're living in. Amen. It's a show of strength. The invisible God become invisible for a moment to let hell know that God's not dead. He is alive. It's you tonight, church. It's you tonight. &gt;&gt; You're the show picture. You're the show of strength. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Oh, I'm so glad I could say I'm one of them. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Don't you hear that? That's the sound of freedom. &gt;&gt; That's in my notes, too. &gt;&gt; I might not get to it. &gt;&gt; I'm trying to skip this. I like to get to one more point. Is that okay? &gt;&gt; It's my birthday. Can I have 10 more minutes? &gt;&gt; Come on, brother. &gt;&gt; I'm just having a good time. Can't have no more funner than this. If you're in the line of duty, no matter what stays in the way. &gt;&gt; The greatest experiences I've ever had is up against when you're up against something and you can't get over it, under it, just stand there and watch God make a way through it. &gt;&gt; That's a way to do it. Just keep moving and press your nose against it. &gt;&gt; That's it. &gt;&gt; For once, you can be nosy. put your nose against it and just keep moving on. What is he saying? &gt;&gt; Just get right up against it. &gt;&gt; Come on now. &gt;&gt; Don't be afraid of your enemy. &gt;&gt; Get up right up. Bump up against your promise. Put your nose right into it and keep moving. &gt;&gt; Cuz it's not your business to open the Red Sea. It's God's business. &gt;&gt; God's going to back his word. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Can I have a amen on that? Amen. &gt;&gt; How many believe tonight as we're fixing to close, how many believes that God backs his up his own word? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Too many promises, too much word, heaven's earth passed away. His word can never come back. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; So God's going to back up his word. &gt;&gt; God's going to back you up. &gt;&gt; They laughed at David. He came out with a slingshot and a few stones, &gt;&gt; but God backed him up. &gt;&gt; They laughed at Samson, &gt;&gt; when he picked up a jawbone, &gt;&gt; but God backed him up. &gt;&gt; They laughed at Shamgar when he picked up an oxo, but God backed him up. &gt;&gt; They laughed at the three Hebrew children, the young people, &gt;&gt; standing on God's word, &gt;&gt; but he was a fourth man in the fire. Amen. &gt;&gt; God backed his children up. &gt;&gt; They laughed at him. &gt;&gt; What do you have in your hand tonight, little bride? &gt;&gt; I'm telling you, soon, as brother Matt said, soon they will not be laughing anymore. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. God's going to back you up. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Why sit here and die? we can go to the enemy's camp. &gt;&gt; And when their faith when they begin to spread their wings, those those four lepers begin to spread their wings and go toward the enemy's camp, God back them up. &gt;&gt; Amen. When they got down there, church, they was all gone. &gt;&gt; Why? Because God magnified the footsteps of those believing lepers &gt;&gt; and they thought a whole army was coming in and it was just four broken down crowatt attaching leprosy. &gt;&gt; Oh, but they kept flying and begin to suffocate. Amen. &gt;&gt; I say, proclaim you among the Gentiles. Prepare for war. Rake up the mighty men. Let all the men of war draw near. Let them come up and beat your plowshares in the swords and your pruning hooks in the spears. And let the weak say, "I'm defeated. &gt;&gt; Come on now. &gt;&gt; I can't make it." Let the weak that the crows are attached to, let the weak confess they are strong. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Nothing is going to stop this bride. No weapon formed against her is going to prosper. Why? Because God is going to back up his word. And his word is born in the manger of your hearts. No wonder brother Bam can make that statement. We're made out of stuff that just can't be bluffed. &gt;&gt; Amen. We're not fly somebody. Hey, we're born of this world, but we're not of this world. &gt;&gt; We found who we really was. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; I'm going to close with this tonight. There was a hero in Switzerland. Brother B said he took all those spears and found the deepest place and he threw up his arms and ran as hard as he could and screamed with all his m might, "Make way for liberty. Make way for liberty." And when he ran, a hund spears turned to catch him with nothing but his bare bosom open in the midst of a bunch of them that ran to grabbing an armful of spears, plunging them into his chest. They caught him with the spears running through him as such a display. What a hero. He routed the whole alien army. Those Swiss men followed with sticks and stones and beat the alien army plum out of the country. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Because one man was willing to step out and take the place and make a sacrifice that was needed. &gt;&gt; But my brother, listen, that was a small thing. when one day Adam's race was backed into a corner. And God has sent them a law. They didn't keep it. God sent the prophets. They stoned them, made fun of them. Then they sent them judges. They wouldn't tell him to rule over them. Every hope had been lost. Adam's race was sin, sickness, diseases. All was backed in a corner. And the devil was with his own marching army. Diseases, sin, whipping Adam's race down just as fast as he could. And then one stepped out of heaven. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Oh my. But then somebody stepped out of heaven. This day I'm going to go to earth. And he stepped out and took Joe Reynolds place. &gt;&gt; When he was on earth, he looked and seen with the greatest dread that man had. The thickest spears was death. Ever. Man's afraid of death. And he raised his precious hands to the heavens. And he struck the very hardest part of the worst enemy man has. And he plunged the spear of death into his own precious bosom. And he sent back on the day of Pentecost through Adam's fallen race the baptism of the Holy Ghost, saying, "Take up this and do the best you can. Fight away ignorance. Fight away superstition. Fight away sin. Fight away sickness." Men who claim that kiss the rim of the cup of blessing God. How can we hold our peace and such a time when God has given us the most powerful weapon that man ever placed a place in the man's hands to fight against sin, sickness, ignorance, superstition, isms. He says it's a real sky full of genuine &gt;&gt; baptism of the Holy Spirit &gt;&gt; and we stand in the corner like a bunch of cowards. &gt;&gt; God wants men. God wants women who will stand out and take the place. &gt;&gt; Listen to this in closing. God wants a hero. &gt;&gt; God wants a hero. Could you be one? He says, "Could you be one tonight, Grace Tabernacle? Could you be a hero?" Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; Oh, brother. This is God's word which is sharper than any two-edged sword. It's the greatest power that ever was put in the hands of man. God is expecting Adam's race to put sickness, sin, &gt;&gt; devils to the fighting walls. Amen. &gt;&gt; We got the most powerful weapon there is. &gt;&gt; They followed this hero with sticks and stones. &gt;&gt; He says, "But Christ led us with the word and spirit." &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; The rema word. Hallelujah. A living voice. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; He left us with the most powerful weapon was his word. the mechanics and the spirit, the dynamics. He says, "Let's fight." &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; Come on, Satan. Come on, crows. &gt;&gt; Let's fight. &gt;&gt; He left us with the best weapon that would defeat Satan any place &gt;&gt; under any condition. &gt;&gt; We've got it. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; It ain't a cold that we got. &gt;&gt; It ain't co that we got. We got it. Amen. &gt;&gt; What you got, brother Joe? Holy Ghost and fire. &gt;&gt; Shut up in this clay. &gt;&gt; Hell can't silence it. &gt;&gt; Demons can't stop it. &gt;&gt; Oh yeah, you're you're blowing again, brother. No, I'm a hero. &gt;&gt; God wants a hero. Say, "God, I'm your hero tonight." &gt;&gt; He gave them sticks and stones. They seen their hero. He went out there and took the the the the spears into his bosom and they took sticks and stones and began to fight. He said, "What about you people? What about you eagles?" He's led you with the most powerful weapon. Don't let that crow defeat you. Don't let that crow attach to your spirit any longer. &gt;&gt; Let's fight. &gt;&gt; Can I have a witness tonight? We got the most powerful weapon. He says, "Let's stand for Christ." &gt;&gt; Christ left us a word and spirit. Let's fight. Let's stand for Christ. Let's stand for the word. &gt;&gt; Let's pull the sword out of our sheath. &gt;&gt; It's our only form of offense. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Amen. &gt;&gt; It's the greatest gift or weapon that God could ever give you. &gt;&gt; It can defeat Satan any place from the Garden of Eden until the rapture. &gt;&gt; And you got it. &gt;&gt; And you got it. &gt;&gt; And you're all backed up. &gt;&gt; God is backing you up. &gt;&gt; You are his show of strength in 2025. Grace Tabernacle. It's a good feeling, Pastor Matt. We boy, your people is a good show up here. True two true word tabernacle meeting Youth Valley, man. Your people, they conduct themselves. There's a great show picture for Grace Tabernacle. Well, how's that make you feel? Well, I tell you how it made him feel. He couldn't wait to get up here Sunday morning and tell the church about it. &gt;&gt; Why? Because he's proud of us. How much more is God proud of us tonight, church? We're a show picture. &gt;&gt; We got it. &gt;&gt; We're Jesus Christ in bride form &gt;&gt; with an arsenal that can't be stopped. They could put us in a grave. We're going to rise again. They could put us in a sea. We're going to rise again. They could put us in a dungeon. We're going to rise again. &gt;&gt; Spread your wings. &gt;&gt; Let me finish this. He said, "Let's stand for the word." Men and women, it's time that we pick up the weapon that our hero of God with God's love left us and dash out yonder and fight fight against ignorance. I guess he is fighting some ignorance. Fighting some ignorance. What kind of ignorance is letting that crow attach yourself to our spirits and let him find a place of abode? I say we need to run him off. He's on po posted ground tonight. &gt;&gt; That's water has no right to be there. You know I if the musicians will come. Amen. You know the only power Satan has tonight is when you give it to him. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Amen. That crow will stay there as long as you let him attach. But when that eagle got tired of the chatter chatter, oh yeah, he was equipped. &gt;&gt; That's all I'm saying tonight. Brother David, you are equipped. Brother Phil, you're equipped. &gt;&gt; Brother Caleb, you're equipped. &gt;&gt; Brother Johnny, you're equipped. &gt;&gt; I'm equipped. &gt;&gt; Why sit here and be defeated? Let's go to the enemy's camp and take back what belongs to us. [Applause] &gt;&gt; They might laugh at us, &gt;&gt; but soon they wouldn't be laughing any longer. &gt;&gt; Fight against ignorance, superstitions, formality, and break down the walls of the enemy. and display the real gallant love that we believe in. God and his word till sickness is healed and devils are routed and the blind sees and the deaf hears. &gt;&gt; Let's fight. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Don't you love him tonight? &gt;&gt; Let's just stand to our feet for a moment. My hope, [Music] my hope is in the Lord and ever more. My hope is in the Lord. Forever more. [Music] I stand it all within the presence of the Lord. [Music] So lovely life raging of the seas subsides. Living sacrifice the only source of life.

[Music] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Oh, don't you love him, saints? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. [Music] When the music fades and all it swept away, I just simply come [Music] longing just to bring. Oh, something that's a word that will bless your heart. I'll bring you more than a song. For a song in itself is not what you have required. You search much deeper with me. Through the way things, you're looking into my heart. I'm coming back to the heart of worship. When it's all about you, when it's all about you, Jesus. I'm sorry, Lord, for the thing that I made. When it's all about you. Oh, it's all about you, Jesus. [Music] Being a pinless. No one could express how much you deserve. [Music] Though I'm weak and I'm bored. Oh, all I have is yours. All I need. Oh, do you believe it, saints? I bring you more than a song. For a song in it is not what you have required. You search much deeper within than the dream. You're looking into my heart. I'm coming back to the heart of worship. When it's all about you, it's all about you, Jesus. for the things I made. And it's all about you. It's all about you, Jesus. Can we just bow our hearts, Lord Jesus? Lord God, we thank you, Lord, for allowing us to be a part of this greatest hour there ever has been. What a showdown that's been going on here in this this last day and age, Lord God. But most of all, Lord, we thank you, Lord, for sending back the material, Lord God, that hell can't stop, Lord. The same material that you're made out of, though the greatest weapon is a believer in contact with this material, Lord. Oh, Lord God, hell can't stop us, Lord. The grave can't stop us. Death can't stop us, Lord. We're going to make it. Oh, we believe it, Lord. Just in a few more days, we're going to be walking. We're going to walk right out of this dimension of of sorrow, this dimension of sickness and diseases into a dimension will never hurt again. There'll be no more death. There'll be no more sorrow. Lord, we're spreading our wings now knowing it just a matter of days. We're going to be a dot that's going to be was not anymore. We believe it. That's what the message of the hour has explained to us. Lord, we know it by revelation. And upon this rock, you're going to build your church. And the gates of Hades cannot prevail against it. Help us, Lord. Begin to elevate that we can suffocate the crows that tries to attach and drain our victory. Help us, Lord Jesus. In the name of the Lord Jesus Christ, we pray that you bless every saint here tonight. We love you and thank you for your presence tonight, Lord, in Jesus Christ's name. Amen. Just before we turn, I sing a a New Testament church rising up. [Music] [Music] [Music] Jesus, we believe you're healing tonight. Oh God, you said by your stripes we are healed. Lord God, you said lay hands on the sick, Lord, and they shall recover. Lord, we anoint our sister with hope. Lord, we pray the prayer of faith. Lord God, in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ, I pray that you touch your natural body, we ask and believe it now in Jesus Christ. Amen. &gt;&gt; I believe he's a healer tonight. &gt;&gt; Glory to God. [Music] I see God's mighty hand. The bride of Christ adorned a wedding gown. Just like in the days of old, they stood in courage b. They turn this whole world upside down. Oh, rising up, rising up. Oh, we have some eagles here tonight. Oh, rising up. rising up. There's a New Testament church rising up. Now, the Bible plainly tells how the Holy Ghost is filled [Music] by apostles. Even spirit were cast out in the tail. They sing and shout or surrounded by God's holy angel. Ain't that much? Oh, hallelujah. [Music] There's a New Testament church rising. Oh, rising up. Rising up. &gt;&gt; I want to sing this one tonight. If you think it's all long gone and the miracles are done, I got good news for you. In the last days, out of spirit more what we do. Oh, rising up. Rising up. There's a new testament church. God bless you. [Music] We're rising up. Rising up. There's a New Testament church rising up. We're rising up. Rising up. There's a New Testament church rising up. Will the Bible plain details how the Holy Ghost fell, how signs and wonders were done at the apostles. Well, demon spirits were cast out in the jail. They sang and shout while surrounded by God's holy angel way. We're rising up. Rising up. There's a New Testament church rising up. We're rising up. We're rising up. Well, there's a New Testament church rising up. Well, I say Satan, your kingdom's coming down. Well, Satan, your kingdom's coming down. coming down down down coming down down down. Well, Satan, your kingdom's coming down. Won't you tell him, "Well, Satan, your kingdom's coming down." I say, "Oh, Satan, your kingdom's coming down." For I heard a voice from heaven say that Satan, your kingdom's coming down. now. But I know Jesus, this kingdom's rising up. Well, Jesus, this kingom's rising up. Cuz I heard the voice from heaven say, "Oh Jesus, this kingdom's rising up." Can you tell him like this? Well, Satan, I'll tear your kingdom down. Well, Satan, I'm going to tear your kingdom down. Cuz I heard a voice and it's resting in my heart. I say, Satan, I'm going to tear your kingdom down. How you going to do it, brother man? Well, Satan, I'm going to praise your kingdom down. Willow Satan, I praise your kingdom down. Cuz I heard a voice from heaven say, "Well, Satan, I'm going to praise your kingdom down." I say, "Oh, Satan, we'll worship your kingdom down." I believe that tonight. Well, Satan, I worship that your kingdom comes falling down. Cuz I heard a voice from heaven speak. I say, "Satan, I praise your kingdom down." I said, "Oh, Satan, I'm going to walk your kingdom now." Is that right? By faith. The Bible said we walk by faith. I'll walk your kingdom down. Cuz I've heard the voice from heaven speak. I say, "Satan, I'm going to walk your kingdom down." What about this one right out of the Bible? Well, Satan, I'm going to dance your kingdom down. Well, now Satan, I'll dance your kingdom down. Cuz I heard a voice from heaven speak. So, Satan, I'm going to dance your kingom down. [Applause] I believe his kingdom's already been took a licking tonight. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. I believe that I've heard a voice from heaven speak. &gt;&gt; Satan, your kingdom is coming down. Amen. How many enjoyed that message tonight? I'm going to tell you this. I think that's powerful that a that a the president let a B2 bomber, an invisible weapon, become visible in the presence of the enemy &gt;&gt; just long enough that he could feel the power of it. And I thought, isn't that what our our God done, &gt;&gt; the Bible said he loved the world and he gave his only begotten son? &gt;&gt; That one day whenever Satan thought he had this world all in control, but God let that invisible power become visible upon the earth just long enough that the enemy would recognize the power of God. That's why when that Holy Ghost in you begins to speak to the devil that the devil trembles because he recognizes that power. I I wish I could hear the secret service say, "Well, you know, that's awful rumbling what you felt, but you only felt one of them, but the hundred you couldn't see." &gt;&gt; It has the same power as those that you seen come across the battle. &gt;&gt; Amen. I believe that tonight that God has made visible an invisible power in our life. That's shouting material right there. I I don't know about y'all, but that I'm going to be I'm going to be feeding on that all night. Let me let me say it like a preacher. I'm going to be building on that all night. The Bible says it's it's uh it's uh seed to the ser and bread to the eater. So, I'll take it as seed. I I come on build on that all night long. I might be in the I might not be able to go to sleep tonight thinking about that. God becoming visible &gt;&gt; in the presence of our enemies. Amen. Amen. Isn't that wonderful? Somebody give the Lord a hand clap of praise tonight. You say, "Brother Matt, I don't have what it takes to overcome." Isn't that the Isn't that the saying always? I don't have what it takes. Well, what does it take? I may not be able to preach. I might not be able to sing. I might not be able to pray like the prayer warrior, but what does it take? Samson picked up a jawbone. David took a sling. I don't I I don't care what it was. It wouldn't matter me if it's a jawbone or a rock. It was just whatever Samson would put in his hand. That's how he overcame the enemy because he was anointed of God to overcome. And when you get a revelation that you're an anointed overcomer, it don't matter what God put in your hand. You could be completely broke and not have two things to put together, but if you're anointed of God to overcome, then whatever God gave you is what you'll overcome with. &gt;&gt; I believe that whatever is laying in your path, you'll overcome with it. I believe that this morning. You love the Lord tonight. &gt;&gt; Amen. We just appreciate the Lord. And Amen. We just want to invite the youth uh this Saturday between 6:00 and 8:00 p.m. to the fellowship hall. We're going to have a meeting with the young people. I'll be there. Brother Brian be there as well. We're going to have some food and everything. We'll feed all all the young people and have something special there uh in store for all the youth. It doesn't matter uh the ages. If you bring kids that are under 10 years old, please accompany them and sit by them and and join in with them and have a wonderful time. But if they're uh but if they're over 10, you can drop them off and we'll we'll take it from there. But if they're under 10, uh just be right there with them and just enjoy the the youth service. So, we just want to make it enjoyable uh and be able to allow the Lord uh to be able to come. So, just want to invite everybody for that. Also, um tonight we're going to have some fellowship in the fellowship hall. If anybody'd like to stick around uh for that, we certainly would enjoy uh the time of fellowship. So, let's just bow our heads together and Amen. just I trust everybody's all their hearts and minds are clear and enjoy the presence of the Lord tonight. And amen. And I believe that every service that we come to, we can we can find things that we don't like about it, but it don't matter. I've never been in a church service that if you want to be critical, you couldn't find something to be critical about. But I know that I've never been in a church service one that I couldn't find something that God had said or done or or spoke something to me. And I just choose to take what God gives me. Uh you know, and I take the prescription, allow myself to be able to grow and be encouraged in the word of God. So let's just bow our heads together. Our gracious heavenly father, Lord, we just thank you, Lord, tonight, Lord, for the word of God. And Lord, we thank you for a word of encouragement, Lord. We thank you for our brother just pouring his heart out to the church. And Lord, I just pray that you would give him a special blessing tonight. Lord, I pray you'd give him strength. Lord, that we would be able to come back Sunday. Lord, I pray that you would bring such an encouragement to each believer. Lord, I saw your hand in this service tonight, Lord, speaking to many situations, Lord, and the things that I I know that that are needed, Lord. And I just ask you, Lord, that they would find encouragement in your word. And Lord, may we go from this place rejoicing, Lord, knowing we've been in your presence, and we're careful, Lord, to give you the glory for all that's been done and said. We thank you now in Jesus Christ's name we pray. Amen. God bless you tonight. Key of D. Well, I've got a feeling. Well, everything's going to be all right. Oh, I've got a feeling. Everything's going to be all right. Oh, [Music] I've got this feeling. Everything's going to be all right. Be all right. be all right. Be all right. [Music] Will God send Moses lead all his people out? Well, Pharaoh's heart was hardened. Thought he'd give them a new round. So, he chased them all down to that Red Sea shore. He thought he wouldn't have to worry about Moses anymore. But Moses stretched his rod out over the sea. And the Lord answered Moses with a little gentle breeze. I can see Moses now with a smile on his face. Just telling all the people with his gentle grace. Still I got this feeling everything's going to be all right. Oh, I got a feeling that everything's going to be all right. Oh, I got this feeling everything's going to be all right. Be all right. Be all right. Be all right. [Music] Well, a little boy named David went out to fight a giant. And everybody laughed at such a funny little side. What a little shepherd boy. He was armed with a swing. And beside that great Goliath seemed such a puny little thing. But David said, "You come to me with spear and a sword." But I come to you in the name of the Lord. He put in a stone and he gave it a flame. And when he left his hand, well, David began to sing. Well, I got this feeling that everything's going to be all right. Oh, I've got a feeling that everything's going to be all right. Oh, I got a feeling everything's going to be all right. Be all right. Be all right. Be all right. Well, now for the greatest story of them all. My Jesus was a dying and they let a fall. Well, demons were rejoicing. They thought they'd won the war, but soon they would not be laughing anymore. So on that first Easter morning, when the sun woke up the earth and the caverns of the deep opened up to give birth to a resurrected Savior with healing in his wings. And now the horse of children arise and sing. Well, I've got a feeling everything's going to be all right. Oh, I've got this feeling that everything's going to be all right. Oh, I've got a feeling everything will be all right. Be all right. Be all right. Be all right.
