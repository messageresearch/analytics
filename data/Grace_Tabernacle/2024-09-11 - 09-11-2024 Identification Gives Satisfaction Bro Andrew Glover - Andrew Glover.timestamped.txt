[42:20] Lord father we invite you among us
[42:22] tonight in a special way and Lord we
[42:25] commit this Mee in thy faithful hands in
[42:27] the name of the Lord Jesus Christ we
[42:29] pray and all the Believers
[42:31] says amen and amen God bless you tonight
[42:34] if you have your Bibles we want to go to
[42:36] the Book of Romans the sixth chapter The
[42:39] Book of Romans the sixth
[42:42] chapter Romans the 6th chapter and then
[42:45] also we're going to look in the Book of
[42:47] Matthew the fifth chapter amen we just
[42:49] have a few uh simple things here on our
[42:51] heart tonight we pray it'll be a
[42:52] blessing to you uh in Romans chapter 6
[42:55] and it may be a little bit of a a
[42:57] lengthy reading I want to read down to
[42:59] the 15th verse in Romans 6 uh Paul here
[43:02] writing he's speaking about the divine
[43:05] grace and how that we're not to abuse
[43:08] that divine grace and he says here in
[43:10] Romans 6 and verse one he says what
[43:12] shall we say then shall we continue in
[43:15] sin that Grace May abound he says God
[43:19] forbid how shall we that are dead to sin
[43:22] live any longer therein know ye not that
[43:26] so many of us us as we're baptized into
[43:28] Jesus Christ were baptized into his
[43:31] death now therefore we are buried with
[43:33] him by baptism into death that like as
[43:36] Christ was raised up from the dead by
[43:39] the glory of the father even so we also
[43:43] should walk in the newness of life for
[43:46] if we have been planted together in the
[43:48] likeness of his death we shall be also
[43:50] in the likeness of his resurrection now
[43:53] knowing this that our old man is
[43:55] crucified with him
[43:57] that the body of sin might be destroyed
[44:01] that henceforth we should not serve sin
[44:04] for he that is dead is freed from sin
[44:06] now if we be dead with Christ we believe
[44:08] that we shall also live with him knowing
[44:11] that Christ being raised from the dead
[44:14] dieth no more then death hath no more
[44:17] dominion over him for in that he died he
[44:21] died into sin once but in that he live
[44:24] liveth he liveth unto God now likewise
[44:26] you reckon ye also yourselves to be dead
[44:29] indeed unto sin but alive unto God
[44:33] through Jesus Christ Our Lord now let
[44:35] not sin therefore reign in your mortal
[44:37] body that you should obey it in the lust
[44:39] thereof neither yield ye your members as
[44:42] instruments of unrighteousness Unto sin
[44:45] but yield yourselves unto God as those
[44:47] that are alive from the dead and your
[44:49] members as instruments of righteousness
[44:51] unto God I love verse
[44:54] 14 for sin shall not have dominion over
[44:58] you amen unbelief shall not have
[45:02] dominion over you for ye are not under
[45:05] the law but under grace amen ye are not
[45:08] under the law but under grace now in
[45:11] Matthew Chapter 5 and verse 6 I want to
[45:13] read just one uh verse there I know we
[45:16] would know this scripture by heart in
[45:18] Matthew Chapter 5 and verse number six
[45:21] amen if you could give me just a little
[45:22] bit more I'll control it on my side uh
[45:25] Matthew Chapter 5 and verse number six
[45:27] you love the Lord tonight amen that
[45:30] sounded better and better a little bit
[45:31] more amen amen that's good blessed are
[45:34] they which do hunger and thirst after
[45:37] righteousness now watch this for they
[45:40] shall be filled that's not a possibility
[45:44] that's a promise if you are hungry and
[45:46] you are thirsting after righteousness
[45:49] they shall be filled we ask Lord this
[45:52] evening to add the blessing to the
[45:53] reading of his word as you can have your
[45:54] seats here uh this afternoon I I want to
[45:57] by the help of the Lord to speak to you
[45:59] tonight by this uh scripture here and if
[46:01] I would title this tonight I want to
[46:02] talk to you on this identification gives
[46:06] satisfaction identification gives
[46:09] satisfaction and you know the prophet of
[46:11] God would tell us there in the message
[46:12] the Easter seal he said you know the
[46:14] church is losing its identification and
[46:18] I think that's a very dangerous thing
[46:20] amen is when a church begins to lose its
[46:22] identification now we know in Matthew
[46:25] chap 5 and verse 6 that that's actually
[46:27] uh what the Bible calls Jesus Sermon on
[46:30] the Mount and it says there in Matthew 5
[46:32] and6 it gives us this promise amen that
[46:35] we would not be empty we would not be
[46:37] partially filled amen but it said we
[46:39] shall be filled amen or we shall be full
[46:43] we shall be filled or we shall be full
[46:45] now when you read the book of Matthew uh
[46:47] the keyword there of the Book of Matthew
[46:49] is the word fulfilled which you would
[46:51] know there that the root word of
[46:53] fulfilled is full and I love that that
[46:56] definition of the word full there amen
[46:58] it means complete so we're not receiving
[47:01] amen an incomplete sermon or a partial
[47:04] sermon but we are receiving amen a
[47:06] complete sermon of our Lord Jesus amen
[47:09] and I believe that we are following
[47:10] tonight the message of the hour and I
[47:13] don't believe the message of the hour is
[47:14] incomplete but rather I believe amen
[47:17] that we have by God's grace the complete
[47:19] revealed word of almighty God now the
[47:21] prophet of God would say and what is the
[47:23] Holy Ghost given for he said now each
[47:25] person sitting here amen is filled with
[47:28] something you're filled with something
[47:29] you cannot sit there without being full
[47:32] of something you've got a life in you
[47:34] amen and that life governs you and that
[47:36] life is governed by Spirit he said now
[47:39] you might be full of the world loving
[47:41] the world the things of the world God be
[47:43] merciful to you he said you might be
[47:45] full of Creeds from some church some
[47:46] little prayer that you say you think
[47:48] that's going to pray to some dead person
[47:50] or make some kind of a cross a sign of a
[47:52] cross you but God be merciful to you he
[47:54] said you may be full of religion and
[47:56] that's that's the worst yet see amen the
[47:58] Bible said in the last days they would
[48:00] be very religious having a form of
[48:02] godliness amen but denying the power
[48:05] thereof from such turn away he said now
[48:07] if you're full of religion amen you're
[48:10] miserable if you're full of Creeds and
[48:12] you don't know what you're talking about
[48:13] amen and if you're full of the world
[48:15] you're blind so if you're full of
[48:17] religion amen you're miserable if you're
[48:19] full of creed you don't know what you're
[48:21] talking about and if you're full of the
[48:23] world then you're blind he said but then
[48:25] again you may be full of a Holy Ghost he
[48:27] said and I hope you are and if you're
[48:29] not I hope you get full amen and if
[48:31] you're full of the Holy Ghost then what
[48:33] if you've got you've got power you've
[48:35] got love you've got peace amen you are
[48:38] sealed you got a sign you got rest you
[48:40] got joy unspeakable amen and full of
[48:43] Glory you are anchored he said that's
[48:45] what you are with the Holy Ghost if you
[48:46] are full of the Holy Ghost amen you have
[48:49] passed from Death unto life amen and are
[48:52] waiting for the general Resurrection in
[48:54] the last day now I'll say this we are
[48:56] not living Amen in an empty age amen
[48:59] when it comes to the word of God the
[49:01] prophet of God would say Amen notice to
[49:03] the Lutheran age to the Western age to
[49:05] the Pentecostal age amen it's been the
[49:07] same thing but notice at the opening of
[49:10] The Seven Seals Revelation 10 the full
[49:13] word amen is to be born into
[49:15] manifestation again amen and Vindicated
[49:18] by the spirit of God in the full
[49:20] strength amen as it was when he was here
[49:23] on Earth see manifested in the same way
[49:26] amen do doing the same things that he
[49:28] did amen when he was here on Earth
[49:30] Hebrews 13:8 Luke 17:30 in the last days
[49:33] it was the days of Sodom amen but the
[49:36] son of man will be revealing himself
[49:38] again amen it will be the same thing so
[49:41] the message of the hour has brought to
[49:43] us amen the full word with full strength
[49:47] Amen to produce a full bride now
[49:49] somebody say well I've accepted the
[49:51] message well let me just say this amen
[49:53] accepting the message is not accepting a
[49:55] man amen or Prophet or a preacher amen
[49:58] or anything but accepting the message is
[50:00] accepting amen the full person of the
[50:03] word of God that's been revealed in the
[50:05] age that we're living in brother said
[50:07] it's right now midnight sence says it's
[50:09] 3 minutes till midnight he said but this
[50:12] might be your Midnight Hour exactly on
[50:14] the dot 12:00 he said I didn't know that
[50:16] this might be 12:00 stroke for some of
[50:18] you he said see you'll either accept it
[50:21] not accept me amen not accept what I
[50:23] said amen but accept the Full Gospel the
[50:26] full power amen and the full Bible
[50:29] everything what God says so this church
[50:32] amen will accept the Full Gospel amen
[50:34] the full power and the full Bible he
[50:37] said they want to tell you to stand off
[50:38] right here and eat some peelings or gnaw
[50:40] on some bones amen tell you the chicken
[50:42] is all gone from years ago don't you
[50:44] believe that amen because God has a full
[50:47] Square meal amen for a full man that's
[50:50] got full faith Amen in the Son of God
[50:53] and will believe it amen and will follow
[50:55] the instructions listen we have the Full
[50:58] Gospel amen with the full power with a
[51:00] full Bible with a full Square meal for a
[51:03] full man amen that's got full faith in
[51:06] the Son of God now we find the world
[51:08] that we're living in today amen there's
[51:10] actually two types of people amen there
[51:12] is a satisfied people amen then there is
[51:15] a dissatisfied people and I'll say this
[51:17] everybody amen right now is trying to
[51:20] satisfy somebody else you know amen the
[51:22] Republicans are trying to satisfy amen
[51:25] the Democrats are trying to satisfy
[51:27] amen everything and everybody is trying
[51:29] to satisfy amen but let me just say this
[51:31] that word satisfy has a broader meaning
[51:34] amen than what the world has made it
[51:36] amen satisfi means to meet the
[51:38] expectations amen or the needs or the
[51:41] desires of someone it means to fulfill a
[51:44] desire or a need Amen to provide someone
[51:48] amen with adequate information or proof
[51:51] amen so that they are convinced about
[51:53] something it is adequately meet or
[51:55] comply with the condition obligation
[51:57] demand Amen to satisfy amen it means to
[52:01] pay off a debt or a creditor now let me
[52:03] just say this Amen brother Brandon
[52:05] preaches an entire sermon and calls it
[52:07] amen convinced and concerned and the
[52:10] definition of satisfi means to be
[52:12] convinced now let's just say what a
[52:14] prophet said he said I am convinced that
[52:16] this is
[52:18] God I am convinced that Jesus is coming
[52:21] I am convinced that this is is first
[52:23] appearing in the form of the Holy Ghost
[52:25] in the last day because the prophet said
[52:28] it shall be light in the evening time he
[52:31] said I am convinced amen that scriptures
[52:34] are fulfilled I am convinced that the
[52:37] world's on the threshold of Destruction
[52:39] amen the world order Cosmos but I am
[52:41] convinced amen that the coming of the
[52:44] Lord is at hand I am convinced that we
[52:47] have amen what we have is the Holy Ghost
[52:50] so listen we don't just have an idea we
[52:53] don't just have religion we don't just
[52:54] have a Creed amen but what we have is
[52:57] the holy ghost that was to come into
[52:59] this age that was not to just move up on
[53:01] your flesh or move into your spirit but
[53:04] the Holy Ghost is to move into your soul
[53:06] and when the Holy Ghost moves into your
[53:08] soul amen you will become convinced amen
[53:11] I pray God we get some church members
[53:13] amen that become so convinced of this
[53:16] message amen that the devil can't talk
[53:18] them out of it amen bad days can't talk
[53:20] them out of it amen feelings can't talk
[53:23] them out of it amen because you know in
[53:25] whom you have believed
[53:27] and you are convinced that he is God now
[53:29] I love what the pr of God said he said
[53:30] now God Amen I pray that your great
[53:33] blessings amen more rested up on every
[53:35] person in the building how many say Lord
[53:37] amen I want to see your blessings rested
[53:39] on my brother I want to see your
[53:40] blessings rested on my sister Amen Let
[53:43] the blessings of God rest upon everybody
[53:45] and if there would be some here who is
[53:47] not Believers as yet amen May tonight
[53:50] they be fully convinced in their heart
[53:53] amen that the true and living Jesus
[53:55] Christ has risen from the dead amen and
[53:58] is alive among the church members
[54:00] tonight listen that's more than just a
[54:02] quote friends amen that is a reality
[54:05] that he's not in a tomb in J in in
[54:08] Jeffersonville neither is he in a Tomb
[54:10] in Israel amen but he's alive and well
[54:13] tonight and he's here identified among
[54:15] the church in the power of his
[54:17] resurrection then the reason that we're
[54:19] here tonight amen is first of all
[54:21] because we're Christians amen we're
[54:23] Believers I I'll get in a second amen
[54:26] we're Christians we're Believers amen
[54:28] but let me say this we also have a soul
[54:30] on the inside of us and that Soul has a
[54:32] thirst you all remember David said amen
[54:35] as the heart panth after the water
[54:37] Brooks amen so panth that word panth
[54:39] means to long for amen my soul after
[54:42] thee Oh God David said my soul thirth
[54:45] for God Amen for the Living God he said
[54:48] when shall I come amen and appear before
[54:51] God said not some historical or some
[54:54] something that happened some years ago
[54:56] or some tale that someone told amen but
[54:59] for the Living God Amen a God that's
[55:01] ever present amen and his soul amen was
[55:05] thirsting for that God in Psalm 63 he
[55:08] goes on again and says my soul thirsteth
[55:10] for thee amen My Flesh longth for thee
[55:12] in a dry and thirsty land amen where no
[55:15] water is brother said now what God done
[55:18] in his great economy for mankind amen is
[55:21] he made a man in the way amen that he
[55:23] wanted him to be he said now he made man
[55:26] to thirst we all agree God Amen the
[55:29] Creator made man to thirst he said now
[55:32] God made man with a thirst he said
[55:34] that's a part of the human being is his
[55:36] thirst amen but God made The Thirst in
[55:39] man to thirst for God Amen but the devil
[55:41] has perverted it so that thirst was put
[55:45] there for God Amen but the devil
[55:47] perverted it and made it thirst for his
[55:49] kingdom for the world he said now watch
[55:51] in your soul amen now there's a control
[55:53] tower in control tower in you amen and
[55:56] that's what directs you he said the
[55:58] control tower is in your body amen and
[56:00] there's one in your soul he said the one
[56:02] in your body tells you the need that's
[56:04] needed in your body and it's brought to
[56:06] you by a thirst he said but then there
[56:08] is a control tower in your soul amen
[56:11] that tells you a spiritual things you
[56:12] have need of Amen something in your
[56:15] spirit and You by this can tell amen
[56:18] what kind of a life is controlling you
[56:20] when you can see what your desires are
[56:23] then you can tell by that what kind of
[56:24] something that's in you that's creating
[56:27] that desire that you have let me just
[56:29] say this God Amen created that thirst
[56:32] but Satan amen through perversion
[56:34] perverted that thirst and that word
[56:36] pervert means to be changed over it
[56:39] means to be made something different
[56:41] amen from what it was intended to be so
[56:43] God Amen put a thirst in you and an
[56:45] intention upon that thirst Amen to
[56:48] thirst after him Amen in the power of
[56:50] His reality in the power of his
[56:52] resurrection but the devil's done
[56:54] everything he can Amen to pervert that
[56:56] now in Romans chapter 1 and verse 25
[56:58] Paul there says amen who who changed
[57:01] amen or that word change is exchange
[57:04] amen the truth of God into a lie amen
[57:06] and they worshiped and served the
[57:08] creature amen more than the Creator who
[57:10] is blessed forever now for this cause
[57:12] God gave them up amen unto vile
[57:15] affection for even their women amen did
[57:17] change the natural use into that which
[57:20] is against nature he said likewise also
[57:22] the men leaving the natural use of the
[57:24] woman amen burned their lust one towards
[57:27] another men with men working that which
[57:29] is unseemingly and receiving themselves
[57:31] the recompense of their error amen which
[57:33] was meat and even as they did not like
[57:36] to retain God in their knowledge now
[57:38] watch this God gave them over Amen to a
[57:41] reprobate mind to do things which were
[57:43] not convenient the prophet of God said
[57:45] when God made everything in the Garden
[57:47] of Eden it was lovely amen but then
[57:50] Satan come in and perverted it he said
[57:52] and now he's gotten this I want to speak
[57:53] on it amen perverting theal origal
[57:56] creation of first he said a woman as I
[57:59] said before amen wants to be pretty
[58:01] there's something in her that she is
[58:03] feminist and she wants to be that way
[58:05] but the way they are on this street
[58:06] today amen haircut like a man wearings
[58:08] man's clothes man turned around wearing
[58:10] women's clothes haircut like a woman see
[58:12] it's a perversion the whole thing listen
[58:15] to The Prophet break this down your food
[58:17] is perverted your life is perverted your
[58:20] thirst is perverted listen your desire
[58:22] is perverted he says it's a day of
[58:25] perversion now why is it a day of
[58:27] perversion because there's two spirits
[58:29] that have been released amen that are
[58:31] working in the world today he said one
[58:33] of them is God's holy spirit amen and
[58:36] the other one is the devil spirit amen
[58:38] that is working in deception he said now
[58:41] the people of the Earth are now amen
[58:43] making their choice the holy spirit is
[58:46] here calling out a bride for Christ and
[58:48] he is doing it by vindicating his Word
[58:50] of Promise to her amen for this age
[58:53] showing that it is Christ he said the
[58:56] the holy spirit is here and he is
[58:58] vindicating the message of the hour and
[59:00] the Holy Spirit is doing this amen so
[59:03] that the people that believe God Amen
[59:05] will be called out of this chaos listen
[59:08] the leoan age is an age of chaos that's
[59:11] why the food is
[59:13] perverted that's why the schools are
[59:15] perverted that's why religion is
[59:17] perverted that's why home life and every
[59:19] kind of life around us is perverted he
[59:21] said because the devil's Unholy spirit
[59:24] is here calling his church by the error
[59:27] as usual by perversion of the word of
[59:29] God Amen like he did at the beginning
[59:31] see it coming right back to that seed
[59:33] time again from Eden here it is again
[59:36] let me say this God Amen is the Creator
[59:40] and he is also the Transformer amen but
[59:42] Satan is the perverter and he is also
[59:45] the deformer in Genesis 1 verse one he
[59:48] said in the beginning God Amen created
[59:51] somebody say God created God created the
[59:54] Heaven and the Earth and the Earth Earth
[59:56] was without form and void amen and
[59:58] darkness was upon on the face of the
[1:00:00] deep amen but watch this and the spirit
[1:00:02] of God moved amen the spirit of God
[1:00:05] moved upon the face of the waters now
[1:00:08] what are Waters a type of according to a
[1:00:10] prophet the waters are a type of the
[1:00:12] people amen and that word without form
[1:00:14] without void and dark it describes a
[1:00:17] life amen that was without the spirit of
[1:00:19] God hey but when the spirit of God moved
[1:00:22] it had the power to transform it amen
[1:00:25] from a chaos amen into a Garden of Eden
[1:00:28] he said see that's what we become we
[1:00:30] become wering Stars away from God
[1:00:32] without hope without God Amen just
[1:00:34] turning around out in darkness amen not
[1:00:37] knowing where we're going now listen
[1:00:39] friends amen without the Holy Ghost upon
[1:00:42] your soul amen you are wondering and
[1:00:44] churning and have no idea where you were
[1:00:46] going amen and God took that great chaos
[1:00:49] of darkness and transformed it into a
[1:00:51] Garden of Eden how did he do it he did
[1:00:54] it by his word and the same way he
[1:00:56] transformed the natural Eden is the way
[1:00:58] he transforms his bride amen is by the
[1:01:01] word he said now the deformer has took
[1:01:04] 6,000 years Amen to deform the word amen
[1:01:08] what has he done amen he has brought
[1:01:10] hisself into a new type of Eden amen
[1:01:12] it's Satan's Eden amen that's where
[1:01:15] we're living today so because we're in
[1:01:18] Satan's Eden amen the devil the God of
[1:01:20] this evil age amen is trying to identify
[1:01:23] amen everybody that's in his Eden
[1:01:26] is that okay amen he'll try to Define
[1:01:28] you amen as condemned or serpent seed or
[1:01:31] amen made too many mistakes or failed go
[1:01:33] amen the devil's always trying to
[1:01:35] identify you but let me just say this a
[1:01:37] Prophet come along and preaches an
[1:01:39] entire sermon and says identified with
[1:01:41] Christ he said you know there is in the
[1:01:44] country today amen so many dissatisfied
[1:01:46] people he said it's amazing when you get
[1:01:48] around and you find out so much
[1:01:51] dissatisfaction people hardly know what
[1:01:53] they want to do he said they come down
[1:01:55] the Road about 70 80 M an hour 30 mph
[1:01:58] Zone amen they slide their brakes turn
[1:02:00] around the corner he said see seems like
[1:02:02] people don't know what they want he said
[1:02:04] now watch if we would go to heaven
[1:02:06] though and we would meet Abraham we
[1:02:08] would say Father Abraham what's the
[1:02:10] greatest thing amen that we could
[1:02:12] achieve he said the greatest thing we
[1:02:14] could achieve is life now think about
[1:02:16] this here is people who have become so
[1:02:19] dissatisfied amen that they're doing
[1:02:21] things amen because they have no
[1:02:23] satisfaction in life which is the
[1:02:26] greatest thing that a man could achieve
[1:02:28] let me just say this the reason why
[1:02:29] they're doing that is because they're
[1:02:31] living between two desires he said see
[1:02:34] there is a control tower amen of the
[1:02:36] soul and one for the body and each Tower
[1:02:39] is a warning caller for the needs of the
[1:02:41] other see each one calls to the Need For
[1:02:43] What the caller is calling for it sends
[1:02:46] out a wave of warning for instance the
[1:02:48] flesh amen thirst to satisfy the desires
[1:02:51] that's in the body amen and the spirit
[1:02:53] desires the things that's in the soul he
[1:02:55] said said desire is and many times amen
[1:02:58] they War one against the other we find
[1:03:00] there what's a great trouble today is
[1:03:03] too many people are trying to live
[1:03:05] between two desires amen for one of them
[1:03:08] desires the thing of the earth amen and
[1:03:10] the other desires the thing of Heaven
[1:03:13] listen the reason why there's
[1:03:14] dissatisfied people is because some are
[1:03:17] trying to live in the world and some are
[1:03:19] trying to live in church amen but let me
[1:03:21] say this if you're ever going to whip
[1:03:23] that devil amen Beyond just Sunday
[1:03:25] morning and Wednesday night you're going
[1:03:27] to have to cross the line amen between
[1:03:29] the world and God and take a stand on
[1:03:32] the word of God and remind that devil I
[1:03:34] didn't come here amen under some
[1:03:36] denominational Barnard I come here as a
[1:03:39] Son of God as a daughter of God I have
[1:03:41] got a position in the kingdom of God and
[1:03:44] the devil and all these angels amen can
[1:03:47] never defeat a son and daughter of God
[1:03:49] who knows who they are by the word yes
[1:03:52] sir see the world is full of people that
[1:03:54] have become dissatis fire with life he
[1:03:56] said now listen some of them are so
[1:03:58] Disturbed amen they'll go down the
[1:03:59] drugstore and they'll purchase a bottle
[1:04:01] of arsenic or sopic acid amen and commit
[1:04:04] suicide he said some will turn on their
[1:04:06] gas jets on in the room or sit in the
[1:04:08] automobile with a pipe amen for the
[1:04:10] carbon monoxide amen what are they
[1:04:12] trying to do they're trying to get away
[1:04:14] from life now come on I know what I'm
[1:04:16] talking about amen and the reason
[1:04:19] they're in that condition is because
[1:04:21] there's a soul on the inside of every
[1:04:23] human and there is a thirst in there
[1:04:25] that God put there from before the
[1:04:28] foundation of the world to thir after
[1:04:29] him but the devil and Satan's Eden has
[1:04:32] perverted that thirst come on let's just
[1:04:34] go ahead and get it out in the open he
[1:04:36] ain't no good Devil he's a dirty Devil
[1:04:38] he's an evil devil he's the kind of
[1:04:40] devil that'll talk you in the Rob of the
[1:04:42] bank and then when you go rob the bank
[1:04:44] he'll call the law on you are you
[1:04:46] hearing me amen because he is a
[1:04:48] perverter there is no truth in him but
[1:04:51] there is a bride in the last days who
[1:04:53] will return to the full word with the
[1:04:55] full power and Believe the full Bible
[1:04:58] and will be transformed into the image
[1:05:00] that God had of her from before the
[1:05:02] foundation of the world he said see
[1:05:05] there seem to be something that they're
[1:05:06] reaching after amen but they can just
[1:05:09] never come to it he said now watch this
[1:05:11] is moved into homes amen which is the
[1:05:13] backbone of the nation and the church we
[1:05:15] find homes broke up and divorce courts
[1:05:18] just overrun with divorces amen juvenile
[1:05:20] delinquency of mothers leaving their
[1:05:22] little children with babysitters and
[1:05:24] taking off out to work some when their
[1:05:26] husbands got good jobs amen but they're
[1:05:28] just not satisfied Amen to be a mother
[1:05:31] and stay at home they're not satisfied
[1:05:33] to dress like ladies they want to dress
[1:05:34] like men he said now men wants to be
[1:05:37] like women and there just seems to be
[1:05:39] something wrong somewhere and people are
[1:05:41] reaching for something and they cannot
[1:05:43] find it amen that's a that's a pitiful
[1:05:46] condition to be
[1:05:47] in now look they've looked everywhere
[1:05:50] now watch this they've looked everywhere
[1:05:52] to try to find something to make themsel
[1:05:54] an example he he said see we take men
[1:05:56] you catch them on the street in their
[1:05:57] business amen the old man wants to be a
[1:06:00] teenager so he'll cut his hair off like
[1:06:02] the flat top and make a ducktail in the
[1:06:04] back he wants to be a teenager the
[1:06:06] teenager wants to be like one of these
[1:06:07] rock and roll Kings where do they wind
[1:06:09] up in sin and disgrace now listen all
[1:06:12] this is happening and they're
[1:06:14] unsatisfied and the whole reason they're
[1:06:16] in this condition is they have no
[1:06:19] identification they don't know who they
[1:06:21] are they don't know where they come from
[1:06:22] they don't know where they're at they
[1:06:23] don't know where they're going so
[1:06:24] anything that comes by they're just
[1:06:26] going to lend their body too but let me
[1:06:28] say what Paul said he said if you have
[1:06:30] been baptized in the name of the Lord
[1:06:33] Jesus Christ you have been buried in his
[1:06:35] baptism and you have raised in his
[1:06:37] resurrection let me say this your life
[1:06:39] don't belong to you your members don't
[1:06:41] belong to you if you have taken on the
[1:06:44] name of the Lord Jesus Christ he owns
[1:06:46] your hands he owns your feet he owns
[1:06:48] your mouth he owns your body because you
[1:06:51] are bought by a price I say it's time to
[1:06:54] come back to the revelation
[1:06:56] that we are identified Sons and
[1:06:57] Daughters of God in the word of God yes
[1:07:00] sir your example let me just say this
[1:07:02] your example amen it becomes your
[1:07:05] standard of Life the probably God said
[1:07:07] take a little boy on the street he said
[1:07:08] he wants to be a paladin or a Hopalong
[1:07:10] Cassidy one of these commercial world
[1:07:12] Amen Roy Rogers or Mr Dylan he said
[1:07:15] trying to impersonate that person
[1:07:17] they've set up as an example and they've
[1:07:19] taken them amen for their standard of
[1:07:21] life he said where they find out the end
[1:07:23] of the road he said those little fellas
[1:07:25] turn turn out to be gangsters and they
[1:07:27] turn out to be robbers he said the women
[1:07:29] turn out to be prostitutes amen and
[1:07:31] Street walking amen and deliquent people
[1:07:33] let me just goe and preach since I'm
[1:07:35] this close to it amen I want to say this
[1:07:37] make sure amen that you know the
[1:07:39] destination of what's influencing you
[1:07:41] amen before you give your members to
[1:07:44] it is that okay amen now look at Marilyn
[1:07:47] Monroe amen prably God said if I could
[1:07:49] have got to her amen I could have helped
[1:07:51] her right amen but what happened she
[1:07:52] become the standard of what a woman was
[1:07:55] look at all the sport Stars amen they
[1:07:57] become a standard amen of what a man is
[1:07:59] let me say this there is a thirst in the
[1:08:01] soul of humans amen and that is for an
[1:08:03] example amen are you with me amen the
[1:08:06] human wants an example they want to know
[1:08:08] something that they can identify with
[1:08:10] that can help them do what they're
[1:08:11] trying to do listen let me say this
[1:08:13] don't ever forget though that there's
[1:08:15] two kinds of examples there's a good
[1:08:17] example and then there's a bad example
[1:08:20] every example that comes before you is
[1:08:22] not a good example the Bible says in 2
[1:08:24] Thessalonians 3 in verse 6 Paul says now
[1:08:27] we command you brethren in the name of
[1:08:29] our Lord Jesus Christ that ye withdraw
[1:08:32] yourselves my goodness you withdraw
[1:08:35] yourselves from every brother that
[1:08:38] walketh disorderly and not after the
[1:08:40] tradition which he received of us for
[1:08:42] you yourselves know how you ought to
[1:08:44] follow us for we behave not ourselves
[1:08:47] amen disorderly among you look neither
[1:08:49] do we eat any man's bread for not but
[1:08:51] rought with labor and travail night and
[1:08:53] day that we might not be charged of to
[1:08:55] Any Man of you not because we have not
[1:08:58] power but to make ourselves an example
[1:09:01] unto you to follow us look at this word
[1:09:04] in Sample it is of a thing Amen to be
[1:09:06] imitated or of a thing to be shunned so
[1:09:09] there are some things amen that you
[1:09:11] ought to you ought to imitate and
[1:09:13] there's some things you ought to shine
[1:09:15] and the Bible goes on to say in 1
[1:09:17] Timothy 4:12 Paul writes to Young
[1:09:18] Timothy and says let no man despise thy
[1:09:21] youth but be thou an example amen of the
[1:09:25] belever Bel in word in conversation in
[1:09:27] charity in spirit in faith and in Purity
[1:09:31] let me just say this those amen that are
[1:09:33] good examples ought to be followed they
[1:09:35] ought to be imitated they ought to be
[1:09:36] replicated amen but if it's a bad
[1:09:38] example it ought to be shunned and put
[1:09:41] out of our Lives put out of our homes
[1:09:43] put out of our families come on church
[1:09:45] because there's a destination that that
[1:09:48] example is trying to lead you to let me
[1:09:50] just say this those amen that did not
[1:09:52] enter the promised land amen they set
[1:09:54] forth an example of what unbelief can do
[1:09:57] in Hebrews 4:11 he said now look let us
[1:10:00] therefore labor to enter into that rest
[1:10:02] lest any man fall after the same example
[1:10:06] of unbelief remember man picks this up
[1:10:08] in the Hebrew series he says what is it
[1:10:10] amen the pillar of fire is here the
[1:10:12] angel Lord is with us he's doing the
[1:10:14] very same things that he said he would
[1:10:16] do and people stumble around and say oh
[1:10:19] well I guess it's all right that's
[1:10:20] pretty good I guess it's okay be careful
[1:10:24] that you don't fall in the same snare of
[1:10:26] unbelief you take it with all your heart
[1:10:29] look at look at Sodom and gomorra amen
[1:10:31] just a few examples you know what Sodom
[1:10:33] and Gomorrah become it become an example
[1:10:36] amen city of what happens when you
[1:10:38] welcome a spirit of perversion let me
[1:10:41] just go and preach amen America ought to
[1:10:43] be able to look back amen and brother
[1:10:45] brother Joe look back and see what
[1:10:47] happened to Sodom and gomorra when she
[1:10:49] opened up and let every Spirit come in
[1:10:51] amen that is an example Amen in America
[1:10:54] should have done that thing amen but
[1:10:56] here we are today and a prophet of God
[1:10:59] said this nation is so bad amen if he
[1:11:01] don't judge her the same way he judge
[1:11:03] them he'll have to raise them up and
[1:11:05] apologize amen for destroying them look
[1:11:08] what the Bible says it says in second
[1:11:10] Peter 26 amen they would turn the cities
[1:11:13] of Sodom and Gomorrah into ashes and
[1:11:15] condemn them with an overthrow amen
[1:11:18] making them an example of those that
[1:11:20] should live after the ungodly Jude 1:7
[1:11:23] even as Sodom and Gomorrah and cities
[1:11:24] round about them in like manner give
[1:11:27] themselves over to fornication they were
[1:11:29] going after strange flesh and they are
[1:11:31] set forth an example amen suffering the
[1:11:34] Vengeance of Eternal fire so in Sodom
[1:11:37] amen a perverted lifestyle became the
[1:11:40] example it became the standard it became
[1:11:43] the plum line he said That's what Satan
[1:11:45] does he perverts the Nations he perverts
[1:11:48] the church he perverts the people he is
[1:11:51] a deceiver he is a perverter of the
[1:11:54] original truth he said now look the man
[1:11:56] wears her bangs and she cuts her hair
[1:11:59] like his and he tries to wear his like
[1:12:01] hers see what it is what a perversion
[1:12:03] what an age and listen what a prophet of
[1:12:05] God said he said oh all these things and
[1:12:07] don't know it see it is a perfect
[1:12:10] perverted spirit is in the
[1:12:13] man so when a man wants to be like a
[1:12:15] woman it is a perfect perverted Spirit
[1:12:18] when a woman wants to be like a man it
[1:12:20] is a perfect perverted Spirit see he is
[1:12:23] veiled amen from the the lust of Satan
[1:12:26] and the woman is too what is it it's a
[1:12:28] satanic Spirit of a Great Society so
[1:12:31] we've seen what unbelief will do we've
[1:12:33] seen what perversion will do let's look
[1:12:35] here at what happened to Lot's wife amen
[1:12:37] here's an example of what happens when
[1:12:40] we take our eyes off the word of God and
[1:12:42] we look backwards in that day he show up
[1:12:44] on the housetop and his stuff in the
[1:12:46] house let him not come down to take it
[1:12:48] away he that is in the field let him
[1:12:50] likewise not return back now look what
[1:12:52] Jesus said Luke 17:32 remember remember
[1:12:55] Lot's wife see brother said see you stay
[1:12:59] with what's preached to the letter
[1:13:01] because it will make a difference he
[1:13:03] said remember Lot's wife she merely
[1:13:05] looked over her shoulder amen and merely
[1:13:07] stopped for a moment just like Eve amen
[1:13:10] but Lot's wife just looked back amen God
[1:13:13] turned that righteous man lot his wife
[1:13:15] into a pillar of salt just a little
[1:13:17] bitty thing just disobeying his
[1:13:19] commandment enough to just look back and
[1:13:21] see what all the fire was about but she
[1:13:23] turned Amen to a pillar of salt and
[1:13:26] stands there yet today as an example
[1:13:29] that God means what he says if you ever
[1:13:32] wonder if God will do what he said he
[1:13:34] will do amen just look back at Lot's
[1:13:36] wife amen she's standing there today as
[1:13:38] an example amen that if you take your
[1:13:41] eyes off of this gospel plow the Bible
[1:13:43] said a man that will take his hand off
[1:13:45] of this gospel plow is not worthy to
[1:13:47] even hold it I say oh God come down upon
[1:13:50] this generation and bring back a
[1:13:52] revelation of identification listen
[1:13:55] nothing will cause us to turn loose of
[1:13:56] it amen no depression no condemnation no
[1:14:00] spirit will ever squash the faith of a
[1:14:03] believer in the word of God yes sir
[1:14:05] remember Lot's wife she had a lot more
[1:14:07] brother said she had a lot more Amen to
[1:14:09] look back for than what we have let me
[1:14:11] go on and say this amen but God knowing
[1:14:13] there would be a thirst in man for an
[1:14:15] example amen he provided us an example
[1:14:19] brother Robert our example amen is the
[1:14:22] perfect example which is none other than
[1:14:25] the Lord Jesus Christ he's the example
[1:14:27] of our homes he's the example of our
[1:14:29] churches he's the example of our
[1:14:31] families listen there is no other
[1:14:34] example amen that we should follow amen
[1:14:37] outside of the Lord Jesus Christ in John
[1:14:40] 13:15 he said I have given to you an
[1:14:43] example don't you love
[1:14:45] that I have given you an example that
[1:14:48] you should do as I have done to you
[1:14:51] brother said but they are trying to find
[1:14:53] something now look here they are trying
[1:14:55] to find something to identify themselves
[1:14:58] with he said that's the reason they're
[1:15:00] doing it is because there's something in
[1:15:02] them that God made them that but God
[1:15:04] made them an example to be identified
[1:15:06] with and that was when he made Jesus
[1:15:09] Christ to become your savior amen that's
[1:15:12] the example that's what people should
[1:15:14] want is to be identified with Jesus to
[1:15:17] be like him Jesus come on the earth he
[1:15:19] said take my yoke upon you amen and
[1:15:22] learn of me amen how many wants to learn
[1:15:24] of Jesus amen take my yoke upon you and
[1:15:27] learn of me for I am meek and lowly in
[1:15:30] heart and you shall find rest unto your
[1:15:33] souls look at this word learn it means
[1:15:35] to understand to be appraised to
[1:15:37] increase one's knowledge amen look to be
[1:15:39] learned by use and practice Amen to be
[1:15:42] in the habit of to become accustomed to
[1:15:45] in Matthew 16:24 Jesus said If any man
[1:15:49] will come after me Amen Let Him deny
[1:15:51] himself amen and take up his cross and
[1:15:55] follow me so your example the Lord Jesus
[1:15:57] he said learn of me and then he said
[1:16:00] follow me in Hebrews 12:2 Paul says
[1:16:03] looking unto Jesus who is the author and
[1:16:06] the finisher of our faith who for the
[1:16:08] joy that was set before him endured the
[1:16:11] cross despising the shame and is sat
[1:16:13] down at the right hand of the Throne of
[1:16:15] God in 1 Peter 2:21 I know I'm reading a
[1:16:17] lot give me a little bit of Grace okay
[1:16:19] in 1 Peter 2:21 for even here unto were
[1:16:21] you called because Christ also suffered
[1:16:24] for for us amen leaving us an example
[1:16:28] that we should follow in his steps so
[1:16:30] our example said learn of me he said
[1:16:33] follow me he anointed Paul to ride and
[1:16:35] say look unto him and then he says amen
[1:16:38] we should follow in his steps can I give
[1:16:41] you all a little something to remember
[1:16:42] we are to learn from our example we are
[1:16:45] to follow our example we are to look
[1:16:47] unto our example and we are to follow in
[1:16:51] our example's footsteps and our example
[1:16:53] is not depression our example is not
[1:16:56] negativity our example is not leosia our
[1:17:00] example is not the church down the
[1:17:01] street or the church up the road amen
[1:17:04] our example is not the White House amen
[1:17:06] it's not the Vatican our example is the
[1:17:09] word of God and we are identified
[1:17:11] Christians in the word of God I say we
[1:17:14] ought to get in these books and tapes we
[1:17:16] ought to break open our Bibles we ought
[1:17:18] to rise to the challenge of the age and
[1:17:20] say Satan you might have perverted the
[1:17:22] world you might have perverted Le the
[1:17:24] sea but you will not perverse The Thirst
[1:17:27] that's in my soul I will not follow
[1:17:29] Hollywood I will not follow education I
[1:17:32] will not follow Sports CS I will not
[1:17:34] follow religious CS I am bound to an
[1:17:37] absolute it's the word of God and I'll
[1:17:39] follow it in every way I can yes sir yes
[1:17:43] sir why because the human nature human
[1:17:45] nature is why there's so many people dis
[1:17:48] satisfied remember said like this he
[1:17:50] said they've got a nature that makes
[1:17:51] them want to have something to identify
[1:17:53] themselves with I've already said it
[1:17:55] I'll read it here again he said God made
[1:17:57] a man to desire to have an example God
[1:17:59] gave him an example he said now if we'd
[1:18:01] be more like him there wouldn't be so
[1:18:03] many big shots in the world well I could
[1:18:06] preach every while couldn't I there
[1:18:07] wouldn't be any hungry children in the
[1:18:09] world there wouldn't be any whiskey or
[1:18:10] drinking the gambling see now that's
[1:18:12] what's the matter with the world they
[1:18:14] got the
[1:18:15] desire they've got the desire brother
[1:18:17] kle God has given them that but they've
[1:18:20] turned it the wrong way but it's time to
[1:18:23] return back he said it's time to return
[1:18:26] back and get on the right Road and get
[1:18:29] facing Calvary nature proves it come on
[1:18:33] church amen I tell you why sometimes we
[1:18:35] get real L is we get our eyes off of
[1:18:37] Calvary let's just be honest we get our
[1:18:39] eyes off of Calvary and we get our eyes
[1:18:42] off of the word and we get our eyes off
[1:18:44] of the Holy Ghost and we get our eyes on
[1:18:46] this problem and on this change in life
[1:18:48] and on this situation and we start
[1:18:50] shifting our focus and before long we
[1:18:52] start going lower and lower and lower
[1:18:54] but can I I tell you why because
[1:18:56] everything outside of Calvary is beneath
[1:18:58] you so it pulls you down but if you
[1:19:01] Hallelujah if you can keep your eyes on
[1:19:04] Calvary Calvary is above your marriage
[1:19:06] Calvary is above your finances Calvary
[1:19:09] is above your job Calvary is above
[1:19:11] everything and if you can just keep your
[1:19:13] eyes on Calvary it don't matter what you
[1:19:16] go through Calvary still has the power
[1:19:19] to pull you out of a bad day it has the
[1:19:21] power to pull you out of sickness it has
[1:19:24] the power power to pull you out of
[1:19:26] depression I say oh God let us get our
[1:19:28] eyes back on Calvary and remember who
[1:19:31] we're following Hallelujah there's a
[1:19:34] cross brother M and it still stands high
[1:19:37] and it still stands tall you say well
[1:19:39] there ain't nobody on that cross hey the
[1:19:41] one that was on that cross is in my
[1:19:42] heart and he will not lead me to
[1:19:44] anything outside of what his atonement
[1:19:47] has provided for me it's time to go back
[1:19:51] time to go back if they took Christ as
[1:19:53] their example then we could fire every
[1:19:55] police there was in the nation yes sir
[1:19:57] my my my my but what's happened is the
[1:20:01] world is in an identity crisis now look
[1:20:04] at this word edti crisis it is a period
[1:20:07] of uncertainty and confusion in which a
[1:20:10] person's sense of identity becomes
[1:20:12] insecure listen it's typically due to a
[1:20:15] change in their expected aims or role in
[1:20:19] society so sister Joyce when somebody
[1:20:22] falls into an identity crisis
[1:20:26] it's because somewhere something has
[1:20:29] shifted their focus off of what they
[1:20:31] should be said like this he said when I
[1:20:34] was a little boy I read the book of tars
[1:20:36] and the Apes and Mama had an old rug out
[1:20:38] there miss walon gave her La before the
[1:20:40] dresser I cut the thing up and made a
[1:20:42] tarzen suit and slept in a tree for a
[1:20:44] week I wanted to be tarzen he said then
[1:20:46] when I read the book of The Lone Star
[1:20:48] Ranger I had a broomstick rode around
[1:20:50] being a hobby horse amen trying to be
[1:20:51] the Lone Star Ranger he said it's no
[1:20:53] more than what people do it's what you
[1:20:55] read come on now it's the music you
[1:20:58] listen to he said go into a restaurant
[1:21:01] and this old rock and roll no wonder
[1:21:03] people are going crazy that's enough
[1:21:05] Amen to drive a human being crazy so the
[1:21:09] books we read I'm not trying to be hard
[1:21:10] I'm just trying to preach something on
[1:21:12] my heart the books we read the things we
[1:21:14] watch the music we listen to amen
[1:21:17] actually becomes influencers over our
[1:21:19] life and we begin to follow that and
[1:21:22] people come under that influence and it
[1:21:24] begins to shape them it begins to mold
[1:21:27] them into what they want that can I say
[1:21:30] something amen George Straight has a
[1:21:31] motive amen for the songs he sings amen
[1:21:34] amen every rock and roll band has a I
[1:21:36] don't mean to call names I'm just
[1:21:37] preaching amen every Elvis Presley he
[1:21:39] had a motive for every song that he sung
[1:21:42] what it was was there was a spirit
[1:21:43] behind it that was trying to become the
[1:21:45] influence of this age and it succeeded
[1:21:47] in Elvis's day do you realize today we
[1:21:50] got 80y old men amen walking around
[1:21:52] dress like Elvis talk like Elvis amen
[1:21:54] try to say oh God are you hearing me
[1:21:58] amen his influence amen did what he
[1:22:00] intended for it to do amen look he's
[1:22:02] been gone for years and people still
[1:22:04] trying to walk around and be Elvis
[1:22:06] singers you know why because the
[1:22:08] influence it found somewhere it could
[1:22:10] get AG G let me just go ahead and say it
[1:22:12] amen am mean get under country music and
[1:22:14] before long you'll get so low amen you
[1:22:16] lost your dog you lost your truck you
[1:22:18] lost your car you lost your house you
[1:22:21] lost your wife amen you want to go to
[1:22:24] we might as well preach amen you want to
[1:22:26] go to a barroom and get drunk amen it's
[1:22:28] bringing you into what it desires you to
[1:22:31] be look at these acds oh God this is on
[1:22:34] the inter amen look at these hard
[1:22:35] rockers amen they don't come in amen
[1:22:38] nice haircut amen well dressed they come
[1:22:40] in black fingernails black eyelashes
[1:22:42] black hair black clothes change are you
[1:22:45] hearing me there's a spirit behind it
[1:22:47] that's trying to influence your
[1:22:48] destination I say Church Living God Amen
[1:22:51] let a boy listen to a song from a
[1:22:53] country music stong and he wants to be a
[1:22:55] cloud boy let a let a boy listen to a
[1:22:57] rock and roll song and he wants to well
[1:22:59] we might as well bring it on down amen
[1:23:01] rap ain't no difference am hey come on
[1:23:03] church amen the things you're listening
[1:23:05] to amen is bringing you under its
[1:23:08] influence well Church of the Living God
[1:23:10] if country music can bring a man under a
[1:23:13] depression and rock and roll can bring a
[1:23:15] man under a hateful Spirit what about
[1:23:17] the songs of Zion that have been sung in
[1:23:20] this generation I say we ought to climb
[1:23:22] up out of lay out of sea we ought to
[1:23:24] climb up up out of this chaos and
[1:23:26] remember who we are we're not a bunch of
[1:23:28] Sunday morning Christians we're not a
[1:23:30] bunch of Wednesday night Christians we
[1:23:31] are identified Sons and Daughters of God
[1:23:34] we know who we
[1:23:36] are Hallelujah we know who we are we
[1:23:40] know what we're following we know what
[1:23:42] we're listening
[1:23:44] to come under the influence of what they
[1:23:46] read now look in Daniel 9 you all know
[1:23:48] the Bible says Daniel Amen he read the
[1:23:52] books of Jeremiah amen and Daniel was a
[1:23:55] young man who came under the influence
[1:23:58] of what he read in Jeremiah's books do
[1:24:01] you know that Solomon knew that the
[1:24:02] young people were going to be
[1:24:04] impressionable so in Ecclesiastes 12:1
[1:24:07] he wrote to you young people and he said
[1:24:09] remember now thy Creator in the days of
[1:24:12] thy youth while the evil days come not
[1:24:15] nor the years draw nigh when thou shalt
[1:24:17] say I have no pleasure in them R said oh
[1:24:21] I read Tarson he said I read the wrong
[1:24:24] Ranger he said but one day I'll be
[1:24:26] thankful through all eternity that I
[1:24:28] read about Jesus Hallelujah and when I
[1:24:31] read about Jesus look at his words that
[1:24:34] satisfied me brother Jonah when he read
[1:24:36] about Jesus it did more than just
[1:24:38] condemn him it did more than just
[1:24:40] exciting but it imparted a satisfaction
[1:24:44] into the control tower of the life of
[1:24:46] that man let me say to you tonight
[1:24:48] friends I want to be like him that's my
[1:24:50] desire that's the kind of example amen
[1:24:53] that God gave us in Jesus Christ we
[1:24:55] ought to be identified with him come on
[1:24:58] that's why I told you amen get your eyes
[1:25:00] off of the world get your eyes off of
[1:25:03] the things of leosa and point your eyes
[1:25:05] back to Calvary the prophet of God said
[1:25:08] finally one day that's that day at
[1:25:10] Calvary there was one came down from
[1:25:12] Glory there was one by the name of Jesus
[1:25:14] Christ the son of God who came from
[1:25:16] Glory listen and calary was formed oh
[1:25:20] Church Amen brother Matt I'll never
[1:25:22] forget the day God revealed this to me I
[1:25:23] said over in your living room at the
[1:25:25] house there in Black Rock Amen the
[1:25:27] calvary was torn amen and the spirit of
[1:25:29] the Lord just came by it's been years
[1:25:30] ago and said these words Calvary is not
[1:25:32] just a place it's a person I thought oh
[1:25:35] God Amen it's not about going to the
[1:25:37] place literal Place brother Benji of
[1:25:40] calary but if you can get in the
[1:25:42] presence of the one who hung up on the
[1:25:44] tree he can do the same thing for you
[1:25:46] tonight that he did 2,000 years ago he's
[1:25:49] already done
[1:25:51] it that's what it was that day count the
[1:25:54] price was paid the sin question was
[1:25:56] settled and it opened the way up into
[1:25:58] this thing that's what we're hungering
[1:26:00] and thirsting for listen Calvary it
[1:26:02] brought a place of satisfaction there's
[1:26:05] no man that ever visits Calvary and sees
[1:26:08] it the way it was that can ever be the
[1:26:11] same everything he ever desired to long
[1:26:13] for is met when he reaches that place it
[1:26:16] was such an important day and such an
[1:26:18] important thing it shook the world it
[1:26:21] shook the world like it was never shook
[1:26:23] before when Jesus died at Calvary are
[1:26:26] y'all ready for this and he paid the sin
[1:26:29] question when Jesus died at Calvary he
[1:26:33] paid the sin question so what he done
[1:26:36] was he provided a way for Humanity to be
[1:26:39] identified in the Old Testament
[1:26:42] identification was a shadow of the New
[1:26:45] Testament identification look here with
[1:26:47] me in the Old Testament when a man
[1:26:48] wanted to be identified at the house of
[1:26:51] God look he took the most innocent thing
[1:26:53] he could find which was a lamb and he
[1:26:55] know that lamb was free from sin CU it
[1:26:58] know no sin and he went and took the
[1:27:00] lamb look and he put his hands upon its
[1:27:04] head and confessed his sin and by faith
[1:27:07] he transferred his sins onto the lamb
[1:27:10] and the innocence of the Lamb came back
[1:27:11] on him then the lamb died because it was
[1:27:14] a
[1:27:15] sinner the man lived by an Act of Faith
[1:27:19] of obeying what God said now listen but
[1:27:22] what did he do he went right back out of
[1:27:24] the
[1:27:26] temple with the same desire he had when
[1:27:30] he come in because when the blood cell
[1:27:32] is broken which Life Starts in one blood
[1:27:34] cell when that blood cell was broken the
[1:27:37] life of the Lamb would not coincide or
[1:27:40] come back into the human life because it
[1:27:42] was an animal life see the man went out
[1:27:45] the same desire he had so therefore he
[1:27:48] committed sins continually all the time
[1:27:50] again why because the blood of bulls and
[1:27:53] goats oh Church
[1:27:54] the blood of bulls and goats amen only
[1:27:57] provided a temporary satisfaction in
[1:28:00] other words sister Destiny it just gave
[1:28:02] him enough to get out the door amen but
[1:28:04] the desire was still there but Church of
[1:28:07] the Living God if you can climb up out
[1:28:09] of the Old Testament and step over in
[1:28:11] the New Testament there was a place
[1:28:13] called Calvary and it was not the blood
[1:28:15] of a bull it was not the blood of a goat
[1:28:17] it was not a Jewish blood it was not a
[1:28:19] gentile blood it was the perfect created
[1:28:22] blood of almighty God can I say this it
[1:28:25] is not a temporary satisfaction it is an
[1:28:28] eternal satisfaction if fat blood ever
[1:28:31] drops on your soul it don't just satisfy
[1:28:33] you for 5 days or for five minutes It'll
[1:28:36] seal you until the day of your
[1:28:38] Redemption I say we welcome the blood of
[1:28:41] Jesus Christ to come back in the church
[1:28:44] and Liberate the church from the things
[1:28:45] of we ought to see and give us a blood
[1:28:49] identification the Bible said he has
[1:28:51] made him to be sin for us who knew no
[1:28:53] sin that we might be made the
[1:28:56] righteousness of God in him I love what
[1:28:59] the propag God says he said I was most
[1:29:01] surely with him at Calvary so I must be
[1:29:04] identified with him at Calvary I was
[1:29:07] with him brother Travis I and you were
[1:29:10] with him at Calvary he said so I must be
[1:29:13] identified with him at Calvary I must be
[1:29:16] there to a place we not also I was
[1:29:18] identified with him at Calvary I died
[1:29:20] with him at Calvary every Christian Must
[1:29:23] Die with him at Calvary if you don't die
[1:29:26] with him at Calvary you can't be none of
[1:29:28] his I was there when he died I died with
[1:29:31] him but Church don't leave us there amen
[1:29:34] and then I was with him when he raised
[1:29:37] up from the
[1:29:38] dead brother Carter I was not just with
[1:29:41] him when he died but I was with him when
[1:29:44] he raised from the dead B said there
[1:29:46] come a time when God made an example and
[1:29:49] he gave us the Lord Jesus listen friends
[1:29:51] and when a sinner puts his hands upon
[1:29:54] his precious head and confesses his sins
[1:29:57] are you all ready for this when a sinner
[1:29:59] puts his hands upon his precious head
[1:30:02] and confesses his sins and his sins is
[1:30:05] transferred from The Sinner to Jesus
[1:30:08] listen and the innocence of Jesus oh god
[1:30:12] sister Joyce the innocence of Jesus is
[1:30:15] transferred by the Holy Ghost amen back
[1:30:17] onto the person listen that's why it's
[1:30:20] not a temporary satisfaction it's not
[1:30:22] the blood of a bull and a goat but it is
[1:30:24] the Eternal blood when a man lays his
[1:30:27] hands on the bleeding bloody Lamb of God
[1:30:29] listen amen amen you want to break out
[1:30:31] of depression I'm going to give you
[1:30:32] something to do it with right now you
[1:30:34] want to break out of condemnation and
[1:30:36] break out of mistakes and break out of
[1:30:37] guilt I'm going to give you something
[1:30:39] right now amen quit identifying yourself
[1:30:41] with some old Honky Tonk Song quit
[1:30:43] identifying yourself with some old s
[1:30:45] five or seven step program and come to
[1:30:48] the Lamb of God and lay your hands upon
[1:30:50] his head listen when you lay your hands
[1:30:53] upon his head you will transfer your
[1:30:55] sins onto him listen what a prophet of
[1:30:57] God said and the innocence of Jesus is
[1:31:00] transferred by the Holy Ghost back into
[1:31:03] the person he is a new creature in
[1:31:07] Christ Jesus not he will be not he was
[1:31:10] he is a new creature in Christ Jesus
[1:31:14] that's where I want to be identified he
[1:31:16] knew no sin was made sin for us that's
[1:31:19] the reason he suffered it's no more than
[1:31:21] what it was right no more than our
[1:31:22] duties to look at these things and see
[1:31:24] that the desires that we have that God
[1:31:27] put in us to create in us and to make us
[1:31:30] want to be like
[1:31:32] him that's a pretty heavy statement that
[1:31:36] the innocence of Jesus is
[1:31:39] transferred come on Church the innocence
[1:31:42] of Jesus is transferred back onto you by
[1:31:46] the baptism of the Holy Ghost can I just
[1:31:49] goad and say what a prophet said he come
[1:31:51] in the visible Union and didn't say you
[1:31:53] were or you will be he said you are the
[1:31:56] pure virtuous sinless Bride of the son
[1:32:00] of the Living God every man and woman
[1:32:02] that's born of the spirit of God and
[1:32:04] washed in the blood of Jesus Christ and
[1:32:06] believes every word of God stands as
[1:32:09] though you never sinned at the first
[1:32:12] place Church there is a blood and if
[1:32:15] that blood has come across your life the
[1:32:18] innocence of Jesus Christ is resting
[1:32:20] upon you by the baptism of the Holy
[1:32:23] Ghost quit living in condemnation quit
[1:32:26] living in the past quit living in
[1:32:28] yesterday step over underneath the blood
[1:32:31] there's power in the blood there's
[1:32:32] Wonder workking power can I say
[1:32:34] something you might have come in here as
[1:32:36] condemned as can be and lower than a
[1:32:38] snake's belly but there is a blood in
[1:32:40] this building tonight and if you'll come
[1:32:42] underneath that blood you'll walk out of
[1:32:44] those doors as innocent as Jesus Christ
[1:32:47] was what can wash away my sin nothing
[1:32:51] but the blood of Jesus what can make me
[1:32:53] whole again
[1:32:55] nothing nothing but the blood of Jesus
[1:32:59] Hallelujah somebody shout thank God for
[1:33:01] the blood thank God for the blood it
[1:33:05] don't remember yesterday it destroys
[1:33:08] yesterday
[1:33:09] [Music]
[1:33:11] Hallelujah I'm talking about the blood
[1:33:14] you're perfect the blood of Jesus Christ
[1:33:17] for by one Spirit we're all baptized
[1:33:20] into one body can I say this to be
[1:33:22] identified with Christ is to move from
[1:33:26] dissatisfaction in life to satisfaction
[1:33:28] in
[1:33:30] life so satisfaction in life is not
[1:33:33] based on what you
[1:33:34] got and what you don't and what you can
[1:33:38] get and what you can't but true
[1:33:42] satisfaction is based on one thing the
[1:33:45] blood of Jesus
[1:33:48] Christ might say well I'm a Holy Roller
[1:33:50] Christian down there porest jobes turkey
[1:33:52] I guess that's the saying out here right
[1:33:54] poorest job's turkey grw up in Hills
[1:33:56] East Tennessee here in all time poor is
[1:33:57] Job's turkey but they're happy you know
[1:34:00] why they're happy because their
[1:34:02] satisfaction is not coming from the
[1:34:04] things around them it's coming from
[1:34:06] what's in them glory to God are you hear
[1:34:09] me Church remember what that word
[1:34:11] satisfied means it means to meet an
[1:34:14] obligation it means to pay off amen a
[1:34:17] debt or creditor look what David said he
[1:34:20] said behold I was shaping iniquity and
[1:34:22] in sin did my mother conceive me can I
[1:34:25] say this David acknowledges that every
[1:34:27] human outside of Jesus Christ was born
[1:34:30] in sin right amen can I say this you
[1:34:32] were born in debt come on it wasn't when
[1:34:35] you got old enough and told the first
[1:34:37] lie you got in debt you was in debt when
[1:34:38] you broke your mother's womb yes sir
[1:34:40] come on church I know them little babies
[1:34:42] amen they're so precious to hold amen
[1:34:44] but can I say this because of the
[1:34:46] perverter in the beginning those babies
[1:34:48] are born in debt but the Bible said amen
[1:34:51] there was a jubilee year come and people
[1:34:54] that were sold out for debts they owed
[1:34:55] they owed a debt and they could not pay
[1:34:57] it so they went sold themselves to
[1:34:58] people for slaves and they had to be
[1:35:00] their slave they bondslave all their
[1:35:03] life but ever so often there come a day
[1:35:06] of Grace if there's ever a quote to
[1:35:08] preaching Grace Tabernacle I think it's
[1:35:10] this quote right here ever so often
[1:35:13] brother Morgan there came a day of Grace
[1:35:16] what was known as the Jubilee year what
[1:35:19] could happen when he heard the trumpet
[1:35:21] sound and the slave was made free he
[1:35:23] could lay down the hole and go home to
[1:35:26] his children this morning we said if the
[1:35:28] trumpet gives an uncertain sound then
[1:35:31] who will know what to do if the Bible
[1:35:33] has preached that Jesus Christ has
[1:35:35] raised from the dead he's the same
[1:35:37] yesterday today and forever and the
[1:35:40] trumpets that we're hearing sound today
[1:35:41] say the days of Miracles has passed
[1:35:43] there's no such a thing as Divine
[1:35:45] Healing who will know how to prepare
[1:35:47] themselves what we need today amen is
[1:35:50] some anointed Messengers from God who
[1:35:52] will stand behind the pull pit and say
[1:35:54] he is raised from the dead and he's the
[1:35:57] same yesterday today and forever that's
[1:36:00] the message of the day oh there's been
[1:36:02] great messages but Easter capped them
[1:36:04] all we' sickness healed in Old Testament
[1:36:07] we seen Miracles performed in the Old
[1:36:09] Testament there was Visions come in the
[1:36:11] Old Testament but every man went right
[1:36:14] to the Grave amen wondering if he would
[1:36:17] ever rise again but on Easter morning
[1:36:21] well give me some shouting room on
[1:36:22] Easter morning when the disciples got
[1:36:25] the greatest message that any man had
[1:36:26] ever got what did they get amen go tell
[1:36:29] my disciples I am raised from the dead
[1:36:33] amen death has been conquered brother
[1:36:36] Jaden it ain't you trying to conquer it
[1:36:38] it's all already conquered I say to you

[1:36:43] a Wednesday night service this is not
[1:36:46] just little something Amen to get us
[1:36:47] through to Sunday this is a sounding of
[1:36:50] the Gospel trumpet it's a jubilee in the
[1:36:52] house of God it's a day of Grace it's a
[1:36:55] day of atonement can I say this I don't
[1:36:57] care what condition you walked in here
[1:36:59] in I'm sounding the trumpet of Jubilee
[1:37:02] over your life you can throw down the
[1:37:04] hole you can throw down the guilt you
[1:37:06] can throw down the past you can throw
[1:37:08] down the condemnation there is a blood
[1:37:11] and it's a glacious blood it's a
[1:37:12] powerful blood and if a man will come
[1:37:14] under that blood it'll release him from
[1:37:16] every
[1:37:18] guilt it'll release him from every
[1:37:20] condemnation I'm talking about the
[1:37:23] resurrection power of the blood of Jesus
[1:37:26] Christ yes sir anointed Messengers from
[1:37:30] God who will get behind the pull pit and
[1:37:33] will fight Devils over you to tell you

[1:37:40] men of God I say thank God for our

[1:37:53] trying to behind you but they stand
[1:37:54] there and they keep on Waring and they
[1:37:57] keep on Waring because they know there
[1:37:59] is a seed on the inside of that soul and
[1:38:02] if it just gets under the
[1:38:05] blood what are you saying preacher I'm
[1:38:07] saying the gospel trumpet amen declares
[1:38:10] this the debt has been
[1:38:13] paid it's
[1:38:17] satisfied I know what you're saying
[1:38:19] you're saying I need some proof well
[1:38:21] when Jesus on Earth he said that he was
[1:38:23] God he said before Abraham was I am and
[1:38:28] I am was the pillar of fire that was in
[1:38:30] the burning bush that spoke to Moses in
[1:38:32] the day gone by I think that's correct
[1:38:35] brother veale then he said I come from
[1:38:37] God and I go through
[1:38:40] God and when he was crucified he died
[1:38:44] and he arose and ascended on high and
[1:38:46] laid his body down upon the great altar
[1:38:50] of the Eternal God to there ever be
[1:38:52] present to act in our place friends why
[1:38:56] are you letting some devil that ain't
[1:38:58] done nothing for you bind you from
[1:39:00] serving a God who died for you come on
[1:39:03] church amen why are you letting some old
[1:39:05] devil amen bind the way you praise and
[1:39:07] bind the way you worship he said listen
[1:39:09] to know that he had paid our sin debt
[1:39:13] and then he returned back to the Earth
[1:39:14] again in a form of a great Pillar of
[1:39:17] Fire let me read you something here in
[1:39:19] Acts two the Bible says and when the day
[1:39:21] of Pentecost was fully come they were
[1:39:23] all with one Accord in one place look
[1:39:27] and suddenly there came a sound from
[1:39:29] Heaven as of a Russian Mighty Wind look
[1:39:32] and it filled it filled all the house
[1:39:36] where they were sitting there appear
[1:39:37] them clothing tongues like as a fire and
[1:39:40] it set upon each of them listen and they
[1:39:42] were all filled with the Holy Ghost I
[1:39:45] opened up by saying that a prophet said
[1:39:47] that the church is losing its
[1:39:49] identification I opened up by telling
[1:39:51] you that it's an age where you got the
[1:39:53] full word you got the full P Bible you
[1:39:56] got the full power you got a full Square
[1:39:58] meal you are a full man with a full
[1:40:00] faith in the Son of God listen church I
[1:40:03] told you tonight amen that this is not
[1:40:05] an empty age it's an age of fulfillment
[1:40:08] look at this and on the day of Pentecost
[1:40:10] it come down and the pillar of fire amen
[1:40:13] can you give me that picture the pillar
[1:40:14] of fire amen it broke apart like that
[1:40:17] and tongues of fire set upon each of
[1:40:19] them not their tongues but tongues of
[1:40:21] fire set upon each of them it was an
[1:40:23] elected selected group identified by
[1:40:26] this Pillar of Fire amen showing that
[1:40:29] God had separated himself into man do
[1:40:32] you get it amen I'm going to ask you
[1:40:34] like a prophet said do you get it amen
[1:40:36] God the L God separate himself into man
[1:40:38] God not in one person he is in his
[1:40:41] church Universal that's the reason Jesus
[1:40:43] said amen the works I do shall you do
[1:40:46] also in more now the King James says
[1:40:48] greater but the right translation there
[1:40:50] is more than this shall you do listen
[1:40:53] God was bottled and confined in one man
[1:40:56] Jesus Christ but now he's bottled and
[1:40:59] confined in the whole universal church
[1:41:03] amen of the Living God can I say
[1:41:05] something to you friends can I say
[1:41:06] something to you that right there amen
[1:41:09] I'm not ashamed of that
[1:41:10] picture amen I'll just go ahe and say
[1:41:12] this I'm going to use it a lot I'm not
[1:41:14] ashamed of that picture amen because my
[1:41:17] my thinking has been elevated above the
[1:41:19] fact there's a human in the picture my
[1:41:21] thinking has gone above his head and
[1:41:23] there's a pillar of fire can I say
[1:41:25] that's the same Pillar of Fire that was
[1:41:27] with Moses that's the same Pillar of
[1:41:29] Fire that was with Paul and may I say
[1:41:31] this on the day of Pentecost that's the
[1:41:34] same Pillar of Fire are y'all hearing me
[1:41:37] they were all in the upper room and they
[1:41:38] were teing and they were waiting for the
[1:41:41] day of Pentecost to what fully come oh
[1:41:44] God they were waiting for the fullness
[1:41:46] of the day of Pentecost they had been
[1:41:47] there 5 days 6 days 7 Days 8 Days nine
[1:41:51] days but on the 10th day amen there was
[1:41:53] a wind coming in the room Prophet God
[1:41:55] said what was it it was the pit of fire
[1:41:58] he said it begin to whirl through there
[1:42:00] and he said it begin to break apart and
[1:42:02] a lick of fire went in there and a lick
[1:42:04] of fire went in there and before long
[1:42:06] 120 amen were full of the pillar of fire
[1:42:10] well may I say to you tonight come on

[1:42:16] something if you want to keep it you

[1:42:20] you a proof of purchase you better get
[1:42:22] something more than I think I paid for
[1:42:24] it I remember what I was wearing when I
[1:42:26] paid for it come on Church you better
[1:42:28] get something that when the Devil comes
[1:42:30] knocking you can say devil right here's
[1:42:32] my receipt may I say to you tonight amen
[1:42:35] if you are a born again son and daughter
[1:42:37] of God who has been washed in the blood
[1:42:39] of Jesus Christ you have heard the
[1:42:41] trumpet sound youve received the Jubilee
[1:42:43] you're in a day of Grace that is more
[1:42:45] than a picture that is your receipt to
[1:42:48] show the devil that the God who died is
[1:42:51] the god who's in my soul he's come back
[1:42:53] in this generation and veiled himself in
[1:42:56] my flesh to say Satan the dead is paid
[1:42:59] for listen I won't pay for it no more
[1:43:02] it's already paid
[1:43:05] for my sins were paid for at Calvary my
[1:43:08] iniquities were paid for at Calvary
[1:43:10] there is a
[1:43:12] blood it's a powerful blood it's a blood
[1:43:15] that goes beyond the way you feel it's a
[1:43:18] blood that goes beyond the way I think
[1:43:20] come on it's an eternal blood
[1:43:23] what are you saying I'm saying this God
[1:43:27] has a satisfying
[1:43:29] portion what is that satisfying portion
[1:43:32] said the Lord Jesus has lotted for us
[1:43:33] the baptism of the Holy Ghost I'm just
[1:43:36] going to take a few minutes here and
[1:43:37] close it and knock that devil square in
[1:43:39] the
[1:43:40] face devil says well is it the will of
[1:43:43] the Lord I have the Holy
[1:43:45] Ghost how many times I meet people
[1:43:47] that's prone to be a little nervous when
[1:43:49] they find out they're trying to do
[1:43:50] something and everything's just blocking
[1:43:51] it off on both sides they say well you
[1:43:54] know it might not be the will of the
[1:43:55] Lord see now don't let the devil lie to
[1:43:58] you like that the first thing is find
[1:44:00] out whether it's the will of God or not
[1:44:02] and then if you want to know whether
[1:44:03] it's the will of God look in the
[1:44:07] Bible there is the thing that sets you
[1:44:10] straight is the word of God and then if
[1:44:13] you see it's in the word of God for you
[1:44:15] to do it like for instance watch how he
[1:44:16] turns this see seeking for the baptism
[1:44:19] of the Holy Ghost many times I run into
[1:44:21] people and they say well I've sought for
[1:44:22] the Holy Ghost I just couldn't receive
[1:44:24] it I don't believe it's for me every
[1:44:26] time I get down I get sick and I go to
[1:44:28] pray and if I fast I get sick if I try
[1:44:30] to stay all night I stay up I get so
[1:44:32] sleepy I can't get off my feet remember
[1:44:34] that's the devil because God intends for
[1:44:38] you to have the Holy Spirit it's for
[1:44:41] whosoever will many times you find when
[1:44:43] you're prayed for in a meeting for
[1:44:44] Divine Healing then the next day you
[1:44:46] find out no doubt that the devil will
[1:44:47] make that twice as bad as it was the day
[1:44:50] before can I can I preach to you see
[1:44:52] remember remember that's just Satan
[1:44:55] trying to get you away from the blessing
[1:44:57] that God's got for you see don't you
[1:44:59] listen to that fell see always press
[1:45:03] right on remember last time I spoke to
[1:45:05] you amen the brides break through you
[1:45:07] got to press you got to press beyond the

[1:45:16] Never Move you but when you come to
[1:45:18] power of the Resurrection The only thing
[1:45:20] to satisfy amen amen can I have five
[1:45:22] minutes here

[1:45:25] longing is to find the reality of what

[1:45:38] type of H hunting equipment you're going
[1:45:40] to set out to find it you're going to
[1:45:42] find the reality listen I'll say this
[1:45:44] the queen of the South she heard of the
[1:45:47] wisdom of Solomon and she traveled
[1:45:49] through dangers because she knew it was
[1:45:51] God's will to see that the Bible said
[1:45:53] the wise men they came from the east of
[1:45:55] Jerusalem saying where is he that's born
[1:45:57] the king of the Jews we have seen his
[1:45:59] star in the east and are come to worship
[1:46:00] Him brother said if you long to see that
[1:46:02] Jesus if something makes you long to see
[1:46:05] Jehovah he's somewhere or you would
[1:46:08] never have that longing you got a
[1:46:10] longing to be in Victory you got a
[1:46:13] longing to walk in power you got a
[1:46:14] longing to walk in reality listen if
[1:46:17] there was not somewhere for you to walk
[1:46:18] in it their desire would not be there
[1:46:20] but God oh God but God is just just as
[1:46:23] good to you as he is to the wise men or
[1:46:25] to anyone if you long for him blessed
[1:46:28] are they that do hunger and thirst after
[1:46:30] righteousness for they shall be brought
[1:46:32] somebody shall they say they shall be
[1:46:34] brought they shall be brought to the
[1:46:36] Fountain where they can drink the
[1:46:39] satisfying
[1:46:40] portion can I just say something to
[1:46:44] you the condition the devil got you into
[1:46:47] is not your
[1:46:50] destination can we just get that out
[1:46:52] there the condition the devil got every
[1:46:54] one of us into is not our destination
[1:46:57] y'all remember brother Bram goes in the
[1:46:58] midal institution he walks in there and
[1:47:00] he begins to look around and he says who
[1:47:02] am I going to start with remember that
[1:47:04] he said who am I going to start with and
[1:47:06] he said there was a young girl sitting
[1:47:07] over there and she raised her hand she
[1:47:09] said well brother bam start with me he
[1:47:11] said start with you he said a pretty
[1:47:13] girl like you what are you doing in here

[1:47:15] him her story how how she did this and
[1:47:17] she did that and how got her so
[1:47:19] condemned until the point she lost her
[1:47:21] mind remember that b said I walked over
[1:47:23] there and he said I got down whether or
[1:47:24] not be to pray she got up she said
[1:47:26] brother Brandon she said feel better now
[1:47:28] it's going to be different he said no
[1:47:30] you'll just turn leaf and go back the
[1:47:31] same way you were before brother said
[1:47:33] listen let's get down and pray listen
[1:47:35] what he says he said and we got down and
[1:47:37] prayed and he said she began to pray he
[1:47:40] said and before long she prayed through
[1:47:42] to the satisfying
[1:47:44] portion come on church she prayed
[1:47:47] through to the satisfying she didn't
[1:47:49] just pray through to a feeling she
[1:47:51] didn't pray through till she thought it
[1:47:52] was better she prayed through until she
[1:47:55] got her eyes on Calvary and realized the
[1:47:58] God that was on Calvary had come right
[1:48:00] there in that middle hospital and he was
[1:48:02] there to do something for her said today
[1:48:04] she's married got three or four children
[1:48:05] what was it she took God and she stayed
[1:48:08] with it till actually something happened
[1:48:10] he said what happened the Living Word
[1:48:13] become a living reality to her and when
[1:48:15] God plants his promise in you it becomes
[1:48:18] a living reality then something is
[1:48:20] different you don't go and say yes I
[1:48:22] believe it the devil believes it like
[1:48:24] that but it's confirmed to you and the
[1:48:26] word becomes alive in you then you begin
[1:48:30] to see what it
[1:48:32] is when the word becomes alive in you
[1:48:36] the living word becomes a living reality
[1:48:40] and that's your identification
[1:48:42] church then you begin to see what it is
[1:48:45] let our musicians come tonight Abraham
[1:48:47] Our Father the Bible says in this
[1:48:50] Hebrews 11:8 by faith Abraham when he
[1:48:53] was called to go out into a place which
[1:48:54] he should have to receive for
[1:48:55] inheritance obeyed and he went out not
[1:48:57] knowing whether he went now look by
[1:49:02] Faith by faith he sojourned the land of
[1:49:05] promise as in a strange country dwelling
[1:49:07] in Tabernacles with Isaac and Jacob The
[1:49:10] Heirs with him of the same promise
[1:49:11] listen what the Bible says for he
[1:49:14] looked for a
[1:49:17] city for he looked yes sir for a city
[1:49:22] which had had
[1:49:23] foundations whose Builder and maker is
[1:49:27] god brother comes along says oh my how
[1:49:30] that steel comes down through his
[1:49:32] children that strain is looking for a
[1:49:35] city whose Builder and maker is God
[1:49:38] another place we being dead in Christ
[1:49:39] take on Abraham's seed and are HS
[1:49:42] according to the promise there you are
[1:49:44] and that brings not in our bodies we are
[1:49:47] Gentiles in our bodies we are sinners in
[1:49:49] our bodies but in our souls we being
[1:49:52] born again with the same Spirit was upon
[1:49:54] faithful Abraham that strained down in
[1:49:59] there that's why you can't get away from
[1:50:03] it you may try but you
[1:50:07] can't because whatever was in Abraham is
[1:50:09] in you whatever was in Abraham is in you
[1:50:12] listen brother Robert why are you
[1:50:14] sitting here tonight because whatever
[1:50:16] was in
[1:50:17] Abraham was in your soul and it was
[1:50:20] looking for a city whose Builder come on
[1:50:23] church amen it went beyond the ideas of
[1:50:25] a church it went beyond the traditions
[1:50:27] of religion there was something in you
[1:50:29] that was longing for the reality listen
[1:50:31] you wanted to hear more than just a
[1:50:33] sermon about heaven you wanted to hear
[1:50:35] more than just an idea about the Rapture
[1:50:37] you wanted somewhere you can Fellowship
[1:50:39] listen our satisfaction is coming from
[1:50:41] the identification we're Rapture Ready
[1:50:44] sister Debbie it don't make no
[1:50:46] difference what the devil does let him
[1:50:47] do what he wants to these bodies but
[1:50:49] there's a soul brother Benji he can
[1:50:51] scare that flesh all he wants to but
[1:50:53] there's a soul in there and the devil
[1:50:55] can't scare that soul I say there's a
[1:50:57] strain in there listen the Devil
[1:50:59] Couldn't scare Abraham away from the
[1:51:01] promise that there was a city whose
[1:51:03] Builder and maker was God and there's a
[1:51:05] gentile bride with a Seed of Abraham who
[1:51:08] the devil can't scare
[1:51:12] neither so what did Abraham do amen Amen
[1:51:16] Let me let me just finish reading this
[1:51:18] he says that strain in there makes us
[1:51:19] want to trust God but the body gets
[1:51:21] scared oh if we're the children of
[1:51:24] Abraham let's be as Father Abraham was
[1:51:28] what are you saying preacher I'm saying
[1:51:30] this Abraham walked in one day brother
[1:51:33] Matt and he said Sarah we're moving
[1:51:37] out where are we going we're selling
[1:51:40] everything we got we're going looking
[1:51:43] for a
[1:51:43] city we're going looking for a
[1:51:46] city now now now just imagine Sarah had
[1:51:49] her tent all set up everything in there
[1:51:52] she wanted everything just right
[1:51:53] everything in place and Abraham comes in
[1:51:55] says we're leaving it well where we
[1:51:58] going something better oh yeah where are
[1:52:00] we going we're going to set out to find
[1:52:02] the city see there was a desire brother
[1:52:05] Matt there was a thirst in his soul
[1:52:07] there's a city somewhere I'm going to go
[1:52:09] find it do you realize Abraham was a
[1:52:11] pilgrim and a stranger and he walked by
[1:52:14] faith for years you know the Bible
[1:52:15] records that Abraham never saw that
[1:52:19] City you imagine he gave his whole I'm
[1:52:22] preaching to you now he gave his whole
[1:52:24] life away he gave Sarah's house away he
[1:52:27] gave everything away and he set out to
[1:52:29] find a city whose Builder and maker was
[1:52:31] God and he never found it but a Prophet
[1:52:34] come along and said one day he went down
[1:52:36] there when he heard lot was captive he
[1:52:39] went down there and delivered his his
[1:52:40] nephew lot and they come walking back
[1:52:43] and on their way back the Bible says God
[1:52:45] came down and spoke a body into
[1:52:48] existence called mzc and stepped in that
[1:52:50] body and served Abraham his Victorious
[1:52:54] child communion can I tell you where he
[1:52:57] served that to him at brother Robert the
[1:52:59] prophet of God said he Abraham served
[1:53:01] mzc or rather MDC amen served Abraham
[1:53:05] communion in the literal
[1:53:08] spot I feel like dancing on that one in
[1:53:12] the literal spot where that City he was
[1:53:14] looking for would come down Church of
[1:53:16] the Living God may I say this amen
[1:53:19] there's a Rapture upon the church
[1:53:21] there's a resurrection upon the church
[1:53:23] there's a body change get your eyes off
[1:53:25] the world get your eyes off the leot get
[1:53:28] your eyes off the problems and Look Away
[1:53:30] to Jesus look away to the cross again
[1:53:33] look away from the negative look away
[1:53:35] from the sin let me just say this to you
[1:53:37] repent of the thing put it under the
[1:53:39] blood and put your marching shoes on and
[1:53:42] walk like a Seed of Abraham walk like a
[1:53:45] daughter of God won't you stand to your
[1:53:47] feet tonight
[1:53:50] [Music]
[1:53:53] quit letting everything identify
[1:53:55] [Music]
[1:53:57] you come on church people said you ain't
[1:54:00] good enough it didn't stop
[1:54:03] you can I just say
[1:54:06] it because what you say about us don't
[1:54:10] identifies we know who we
[1:54:14] are we've been underneath the
[1:54:18] blood said Abraham met him and took
[1:54:21] Community right there
[1:54:23] on the literal spot where that City will
[1:54:25] be raised up in other words he never saw
[1:54:29] the
[1:54:31] city but he stood where it would be in
[1:54:34] the literal
[1:54:37] spot can I say to you what the Bible
[1:54:39] says the Bible says blessed are they
[1:54:41] that hunger and thirst after
[1:54:43] righteousness for they
[1:54:46] shall they shall be
[1:54:50] filled now what is there here tonight
[1:54:52] 4550 5560 a lot of people here

[1:55:17] nerves God's the one who can give you
[1:55:19] that satisfying portion that's his
[1:55:21] spirit
[1:55:22] the reason that you do things is because
[1:55:24] you're substitute in those things for
[1:55:26] the real thirst that God put in you for
[1:55:27] the Holy Ghost but oh come unto me all
[1:55:29] you that are weary and heavy laden I'll
[1:55:31] give you rest see he's the Fountain of

[1:55:41] that's what you're made like that for
[1:55:43] that's why you got that thirst in you
[1:55:45] and then if he can't make you drink the
[1:55:46] doctors can scare you to death of cancer
[1:55:48] in the throat from a cigarette then
[1:55:50] he'll let you join a church now watch
[1:55:52] this brother B said the devil will let
[1:55:53] you join a church and go ahead if he
[1:55:56] can't get you with drinking and he can't
[1:55:57] get you with smoking then he'll just let
[1:55:59] you join a church and just go ahead
[1:56:01] living for the world he still got you
[1:56:03] you're not still satisfied there cannot
[1:56:05] be a satisfaction outside of the new

[2:18:03] it don't it's a perversion where did
[2:18:05] sickness come from say it was a
[2:18:07] perversion of the creation that God Made
[2:18:10] You know what else there ain't nothing
[2:18:12] that Satan has ever made or or perverted
[2:18:16] that has a right to stay in our life
[2:18:17] tonight but in the middle of this
[2:18:19] atmosphere I can say Vision can't stay
[2:18:21] any longer cuz perfect love cast out
[2:18:24] fear unsettledness can't stay any longer
[2:18:28] cuz perfect love cast out fear it
[2:18:31] doesn't matter what it is depression it
[2:18:34] can't stay any
[2:18:36] longer spiritual Brokenness it can't
[2:18:38] stay any longer cuz perfect love cast
[2:18:42] out fear do you believe that tonight
[2:18:44] amen I believe it I believe it's God's
[2:18:46] word and I believe we have a right as a
[2:18:48] body of Believers to stand upon God's
[2:18:51] word I know Satan don't want us to hear
[2:18:53] it and you know what sometimes it just
[2:18:55] takes the Lord to come by and remind us
[2:18:57] of who we are and pick us up out of this
[2:19:00] Condition it's so easy because the
[2:19:02] circumstances of this life it keeps us
[2:19:04] unsettled but you realize that there's
[2:19:07] nothing in this life that will ever
[2:19:09] bring you peace can I say something to
[2:19:11] you tonight that'll help you there's no
[2:19:13] there's no wealth that'll ever bring
[2:19:15] peace you'll never in this life ever
[2:19:18] have peace if you had perfect health if
[2:19:21] all your children were perfectly well if
[2:19:23] everybody had perfect health you had
[2:19:25] perfect money you didn't have no bills
[2:19:27] you had no trouble you would still have
[2:19:29] no peace upon this Earth butram said
[2:19:31] there ain't no peace there's no Eternal
[2:19:33] peace there's no Eternal happiness
[2:19:35] unless you're anchored in Christ Jesus
[2:19:38] he said because God would never allow
[2:19:39] you to have perfect peace on this Earth
[2:19:42] because you would get comfortable in
[2:19:43] this world and God don't want you
[2:19:45] comfortable in this world but he wants
[2:19:48] you to find comfort in Jesus Christ and
[2:19:50] Christ Alone
[2:19:51] therefore in this earth in the things of
[2:19:53] this world you will never have peace
[2:19:55] you'll never it'll always be some kind
[2:19:57] of unsettlers and I don't know what's
[2:19:59] going to happen tomorrow if everything
[2:20:00] was going to be well you'd still be
[2:20:02] worried about what was going to happen
[2:20:03] tomorrow you'd be worried about your
[2:20:04] kids whenever they left the house you'll
[2:20:07] always be worried in this world because
[2:20:08] you'll never find peace in this world he
[2:20:11] said but the only peace we have is in
[2:20:13] Christ Jesus therefore when that
[2:20:15] unsettledness comes around and this
[2:20:17] Spirit begins to to come around and this
[2:20:19] oppression comes on us you say I don't
[2:20:21] find peace here anyway my peace is in
[2:20:24] the word of God I'll never find peace in
[2:20:26] this earth my peace is in Christ Jesus
[2:20:29] and In Christ Alone he said therefore he
[2:20:32] said a real born again Christian will
[2:20:34] always have an eternal peace in his
[2:20:36] heart because our peace is not found in
[2:20:38] this world it ain't in this life but I
[2:20:41] thank God we have a real peace do you
[2:20:44] believe that tonight you're always going
[2:20:46] to have
[2:20:49] unsettling in your spirit Spirit don't
[2:20:51] look at what's going on around and the
[2:20:52] circumstan and the things that's taking
[2:20:54] place in our life but when you're troubl
[2:20:56] in your spirit look back to the Peace of
[2:20:58] Jesus Christ and say but in that I have
[2:21:01] peace I've I've lost but in that I have
[2:21:04] peace I'm troubled in my spirit but in
[2:21:06] that I have peace I failed but in that I
[2:21:09] have peace I don't know what tomorrow
[2:21:11] holds but in that have I have peace I
[2:21:13] don't know if I can make it through
[2:21:14] tomorrow but in him I have peace that's
[2:21:18] our real peace tonight do you believe
[2:21:19] that tonight
[2:21:21] are we Believers amen I believe that
[2:21:24] tonight I believe we have a right to

[2:21:40] don't rely upon this flesh and the
[2:21:42] feelings and isn't it so easy to be to

[2:34:43] calary so I say that
[2:34:48] sometimes I just
[2:34:50] want to praise
[2:34:55] you and sometimes just to
[2:34:59] speak your
[2:35:01] [Music]
[2:35:04] name well some sometimes I just I want
[2:35:09] to thank
[2:35:11] you oh Lord without asking asking you
[2:35:17] for a s
[2:35:22] thing oh and sometimes I just lift my
[2:35:27] voice to
[2:35:29] you
[2:35:30] Lord
[2:35:32] and sometimes all I
[2:35:35] do is
[2:35:39] cry for
[2:35:42] everything that I have I owe
[2:35:46] to you Lord
[2:35:50] for Cal is the
[2:35:54] reason
[2:35:56] why I
[2:35:58] say
[2:36:00] everything that I have I owe
[2:36:05] to you
[2:36:07] Lord for
[2:36:10] calvaries
[2:36:17] reason amen we just want to remember had
[2:36:20] a request for brother Tom Allen said
[2:36:23] he's in the hospital and they're running
[2:36:25] test on him wasn't aware of this before
[2:36:27] the service but I believe that God uh
[2:36:30] knows all things and he's a Healer and I
[2:36:33] believe that we have a right in the
[2:36:34] presence of the Lord tonight to call
[2:36:36] upon the Lord on his behalf and maybe
[2:36:38] he's not in the had the ability to do it
[2:36:40] right now maybe he's not in any shape to
[2:36:42] be able to to call for his own self but
[2:36:44] I believe we have a right to stand for
[2:36:45] him amen he's a brother a Son of God and
[2:36:49] certainly a soldier of the Cross and so
[2:36:51] we want to stand for him tonight how

[2:36:54] heads together and ask the Lord to touch
[2:36:56] his body whatever it is that's troubling
[2:36:57] him whatever the symptoms are just ask
[2:36:59] that they would go by the wayside the
