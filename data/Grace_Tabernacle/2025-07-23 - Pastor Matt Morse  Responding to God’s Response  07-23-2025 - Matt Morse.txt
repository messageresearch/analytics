And I have friends who walked away. And I've even lost myself for time or two. And there were bridges cross and burn through all the wreckage I had learned. And there's one thing that I could never lose. If I got Jesus and I've got hope that I could ever take the world away from me and I'll be okay. My God Jesus. [Music] And there's a hope that's living deep inside. A joy that I could never hide in a safe place to fall. If I got Jesus and I' got it all. And I've seen the rain turn the stream. I've seen there's been a grace. It is not from what I've done. It's Christ in me. The miracle I can't explain. Oh, he's g me his name. I'm the richest girl that I could ever be. I got Jesus and I got all that I could ever be. Take the world away from me and I'll be the father of Jesus. There's a hope in every deep inside knowing that I could never hide the same place before. If I got Jesus, I got it all. And someday that trumpet's going to sound and the king of heaven will ride upon the clouds are coming down. And I'll hit my knees. The war that sings my soul and I'm going home. If I got Jesus, I've got all that I could ever need. Take the world away from me and I'll be okay. If I got Jesus and there's a hope that's living deep inside the joy that I could never hide the safest fall. If I got Jesus, I've got it all. If I got Jesus, [Music] I've got it all. [Music] [Applause] Aren't you thankful you got Jesus? &gt;&gt; Thankful Jesus got you this evening. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; So stand as we invite our pastor to come. Gratitude. Gratitude. This song came on my life. Pulling into the parking lot. I wasn't even not singing it. But the song came on and you hear the song specials. If you got Jesus, you got it all. And you think about all that he's done for you. When you reach down his hand for you. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; When he brings you seasons of blessings, all you can do is just lift your hands to him and just praise him. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Sometimes you don't even have the words, but just a heartfelt hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Or a thank you, Lord. &gt;&gt; Or even a heartfelt cry out, and he'll hear that. So let's just praise him this evening as we get ready to hear the word. All my words fall short. &gt;&gt; I've got nothing new. How good I [Music] &gt;&gt; I could sing these songs as I to do. Every song I sing and you never do. Oh, so I'll throw up my hands. Praise you again and again. All that I have is [Music] I know it's time. Yes. Hallelujah. Thank you. Hallelujah.

[Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] So I throw up my hand. [Music] All that I have is a hallelujah. [Music] Hallelujah. [Applause] [Music] And I know it's not much. I've got nothing else before Jesus. [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] Oh, you're worthy of it all. [Music] Yes, you're worthy of it all, my Jesus. For you are all things. To you are all things. You deserve all the glory. And I know you're worthy of it all. I make it declaring worthy. I say you're worthy of it all. My Jesus. Oh, I know how. You are all things. You are all things. You deserve the glory. Amen. Won't you give the Lord a hand clap of praise tonight? How many say he's worthy? &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Say he's worthy. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Amen. Isn't he wonderful? &gt;&gt; God has never failed us. &gt;&gt; No matter what we've ever gone through, he's always been there. Even when you don't know God's moving in your life, he's operating. &gt;&gt; He's moving things out of the way and moving things in in the way. &gt;&gt; I believe God does that just to keep us in his will. I mean, appreciates the Lord this morning or tonight. And &gt;&gt; my just a privilege to be able to be in the house of God. And maybe we just bow our heads together. If you have a need on your heart uh tonight, I know God is certainly mindful of what we have need of. And maybe just something special you'd like to see the Lord do for you tonight. I believe that we have a right to approach him. And &gt;&gt; Amen. How many believes he's a supernatural God? Amen. We we're not just coming to uh to church just to have a place to go on a Wednesday night, but we really know that we're in the presence of God. So, won't we just ask him to move this evening? Gracious heavenly father, Lord, we are so thankful, Lord, for this opportunity just to be able to come and stand in the house of God, Lord, a place that's been dedicated for your word to go forth. Lord, we come as recipients, Lord. We just ask you tonight, Lord, that you would meet every need. Lord, I pray that you would help each one, Lord, and knowing the needs that's on the hearts of the people tonight. Lord, that you're such a mindful God. Lord, I pray that you would help us, Lord, here tonight. Lord, I pray for Becca, Lord, having her baby tonight. Just ask the church to remember her. Lord, I ask you would meet every need. Lord, I pray you would take this word, Lord, and it would open it to us, Lord, that something would be said, would be edifying to the church. We thank you for it now. In the name of the Lord Jesus, we pray. Amen. Amen. We sure love the Lord today. Amen. We just love his word and love his people. Amen. How many love the people of God? They're just a wonderful ain't a better class of people on the earth than God's children. Uh and I believe that. And they're all over the world. and uh they they come from every different background and every uh demographic and God has raised his children up all around the world and uh has made a great class of people. I'm sure certain certainly uh privileged to be able to say I'm one of them tonight. Amen. &gt;&gt; So we just appreciate uh the people of God and sure appreciate uh the meeting we had there. Brother Davis had a great report and many of the young people that received the Holy Ghost. David sent me a text about it today and many was delivered of things. So, uh you I just know that the Lord is always in control. We can't ask for anything more than that uh than to somebody to further their walk with God. And uh I watched the service on Sunday and just the Lord was really uh uh helping the church here. Brother Joe, I sure appreciate that. I know many of you uh went up for the meetings in Hardy. Brother Andrew was speaking there and had a great blessing. heard great reports from that as well. So, we just appreciate everything God is doing &gt;&gt; and we certainly want to give God the glory for it. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. So, we we know that he is more than able. How many just love the word of God? Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. Won't you just turn around, shake somebody's hand this morning or that? I don't know why it's morning. I guess I miss Sunday morning and I can't get out of it. But tonight, we're just going to have church tonight. Okay. Amen. We just want to invite you to the scripture. We're going to read out of the book of St. Luke in the first chapter and we'll read from the 13th verse. Give you just a moment to turn there. Luke uh 1 and 13. And I just say it's good to be home. Amen. There ain't there there ain't no place like home. That's the truth. Amen. I just just love being at our at our home church. And uh it's I'm hardressed to leave. I don't I don't like to go uh many places, you know. It's kind of an odd thing. I used to love to to go everywhere. I thought I was a world traveler and uh and I couldn't wait till the next time I could go somewhere and but whenever God changes or or leads you into a calling uh that being a pastor, you can't just be a pastor and and want to be gone all the time and then you probably ain't got a real calling to be a pastor. But I just love being home. I love the the people that God has brought together here and I sure love you and I just want to be able to speak something tonight that would be a help to you. So we're going to read out of Luke the 1st chapter 13th verse. The Bible says, "But the angel said unto him, fear not, Zachcharias, for thy prayer is heard. And thy wife Elizabeth shall bear thee a son, and thou shalt call his name John. And thou shalt have joy and gladness, and many shall rejoice at his birth, for he shall be great in the sight of the Lord, and shall drink neither wine nor strong drink, and he shall be filled with the Holy Ghost, even from his mother's womb. And many of the children of Israel shall he turn to the Lord their God. And he shall go before him in the spirit and power of Elias to turn the hearts of the fathers to the children and the disobedient to the wisdom of the just to make ready a people prepared for the Lord. Now we we realize that this is a fulfillment of what uh God had promised in Malachi the 3r chapter and and part of the fourth chapter uh that there was coming the spirit of Elijah upon the earth and he would do those very things. And so uh I want to take this scripture tonight and I'd like to speak on responding to God's response as you take your seats. &gt;&gt; Responding to God's response. I realize in the Bible that there are nearly uh I was looking through different uh scholars that there's anywhere from uh 7 to 8,000 uh different promises in the Bible that pertains to the believers. The Bible's filled with promises that God uh has made to us. And I know that that each one of us in this life that we go through uh many trials, many needs that we have and a lot of times that we have to rely upon God. And uh the Bible tells us that as say as many are the afflictions of the righteous. So we know it's not uh that we won't go through things but brother Ram talks about our trials and the things that we face. He says but we have a consolation uh in all those trials. And our consolation is God's promise. He said and in his promise he said to make our requests known. If you ask anything in my name I'll do it. These are his great promises. Ask and you shall receive. Say to this mountain be moved and don't doubt in your heart and it'll be moved. that all of these promises we can draw from all that we are asking for. And I I think that's our right as believers that we have. How many believes that tonight? That we have a right to draw from the promises of God. So I believe that the word teaches us as believers that we uh that we have a right to petition God for our needs. So as believers, we become petitioners uh for the needs that we have. And you know, you know, I think about that as we are petitioning God many times. Sometimes uh that but sometimes when we when we call upon God for things, you realize that some things that you ask God for are actually not a promise of God. You know, sometimes we I'm just being honest with you. Sometimes we ask God for things that aren't a promise at all. And uh sometimes we ask God for things that we don't actually need. You know, when I when I think about this, it makes my makes me think of one of the most important keys to having a relationship with God. How many wants to know what it is? That that is that you have to trust God. &gt;&gt; How many knows that you you just in order to have a real relationship with God, you just have to be able to trust the Lord? Because uh sometimes we we ask God for things. Sometimes we really need things. Sometimes we really need God to do something and it don't really need to be done and we don't we don't really need it and it ain't going to really bring us favor and it's not really going to help us at all. And you know sometimes we have a great zeal to do something for God. Uh but but it's not in the will of God for us to do it. I you know there's in the Bible tells a story of David whenever he was in that same place. You remember David was a great man of God. I I can't think of anybody else in the Bible that was any greater than King David. The Bible said he was a man after God's own heart. He was a He was a great man of God. He was a great warrior. He had many great testimonies that happened out of David's life. He he took down Goliath. He helped uh uh many times to deliver the children of Israel from that great Philistine army that was rising in the same time of David's reign. He was a great man of God. And uh but even David whenever he went to petition the Lord because he had something on his heart to do. He wanted to build a temple for God. And he said, "You know, I I've been living in this nice cedar house and here God has delivered us and God has done so much for us and why would I let God dwell out there in a tent made out, you know, he's been drugged around the tabernacle of God's been an old tent, been drugged through the wilderness all this time and and all this time, you know, uh we've been building our own selves and taking care of our own places, but you know, I need to do something for God." So, he went to the to the prophet Nathan. And even Nathan told David that you're a man of God and you have the favor of God. So do anything that's on your heart to do. I'm sure that God would bless it. And so here this was this was on David's heart. But then God came in the middle of the night. Remember what he told Nathan. He said, "You go back and tell David that that is not for him to build." So he got up the next day and he said he's not permitted to build the temple. He couldn't do it. He said, "Because I'll raise up from your seed that he will build the temple of God, and that temple will be an everlasting temple. And and from thy seed upon your son, the son of David will be an everlasting kingdom. He would be established forever." And you realize what God is doing is that he was actually using the son of David in the natural to t the son of David that was coming in the spiritual. He said, see, so after this, he wouldn't let David do it. But Solomon, that was David's son in the natural. When Solomon was born, he went out and he in his natural strength, he built a house unto the Lord and it was a glorious thing and it was welcomed by God and the spirit of the Lord was in the temple of God. He said, "But then when the real seed of David came that was the son of David, he told them that there's going to come a time that there won't be a stone left upon a stone of this temple that Solomon built." And he turned and pointed the people to another temple uh that would have that would fulfill what God had told David. It would be an everlasting kingdom. That temple that Solomon built was not everlasting. It was not it wasn't going to last forever. But he was pointing to a temple that would never be destroyed. It was Christ in the power uh uh it was God in the power of Jesus Christ. He that he would rule over all things. He became the high priest of our confession. And you realize that even that's why Jesus would say, "You can destroy this temple, but in three days I'm going to raise it up again." He was fulfilling the word of God to the prophet Nathan. So you realize that God had a plan for it. And God h had a a purpose for the temple to be built by the son of David. And so here he told David, you can't go do that. But you know what David done? He just trusted in the Lord. He didn't go out building the temple. He trusted that God knew better. Even though it was a zeal on his heart. I I know it'll preach, but sometimes it isn't for you to do. Sometimes it's for somebody else to do. Sometimes we get something on our heart. You know, I think I might just do this. And God says, "Well, it ain't for you to do." Sometimes we want to preach, but it ain't for us to preach. Sometimes you want to sing, but it ain't for you to sing. Sometimes you may want to go do a great work. You may want to go uh stand on the out there in the street and start some great revival or something, but but sometimes it just isn't for us to do. And God knows all things. You know, I I think one of the greatest places we could ever come in our walk with God is that sometimes we just need uh uh the wisdom to be able to thrive in the position that God has called us to. &gt;&gt; I think that's a great statement. Sometimes we just need the wisdom to thrive in the position that God has called us. And if you can do that, in my opinion, that makes a real son of God. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; That we can find our place in the word of God. See, we have to be able to trust God. How many believe that? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; We have to trust God. But we also we trust him with our needs. Brother said we go to God. He said don't be afraid to put his word to a test. If God give us a promise, then we ain't afraid to go to him. He said it's there. He's here. The only thing you need to do is go awake him. You remember the message awakening Jesus but takes the story of the disciples when they were going out in the boat and the sea had came over that great sea and it looked like the boat was going to sink and here Jesus was laying over in the boat and he was taking a rest and and all this great storm come upon him and they had to go down to where he was and they woke him up and said master do you care that we perish in this great storm and Jesus got up remember he spoke to the storm and he said peace be still and all the storm went away and he looked at him said what what what kind of faith have Anyway, but brother Bam took a whole message on this talking about sometimes how that we just have to go wait Jesus. Sometimes you have to uh to go to the Lord and and what happens is is that sometimes we get under the wrong spirit and say whenever trouble comes, trouble makes you weary. It makes you it makes you tired. It causes you to uh to to to just want to throw up your hands sometimes and just walk away and and and and to quit the effort. And it don't make you want to pray. It don't want make you want to uh to go to a prayer closet. that makes you just want to quit and just give up and just go do something that can bring joy to your life. And and so he gets to talking about this of how that what happens is a wrong spirit comes in our life sometimes and it points out that everything that's ever happened that was bad. You know, this person prayed and nothing ever happened and that person prayed and they never got deliverance and this person they served God and they died this way or they or this happened to their life. He said he just always points them to this negative thing. He said, "But why would you want to point to something back there or some some kind of messed up something?" He said, "But I know." He said, "We ought to say I that they would say, I know somebody trusted God and they died and they trusted God." He said, "But I know millions of people that went to the doctor and after they went to the doctor that they died anyhow, but that don't make us stop going to the doctor, but we still go to the doctor because we need help and we need healing and we need the a touch in our body." Although millions there's been malpractice lawsuits all over this country by the billions of dollars of medical malpractice there there's been many people that's died from the hand of a doctor but that don't make us stop going to doctors. We still believe that God has doctors and and he gives them the gift and the the ability to be able to help us. He said so if millions should go to a doctor that don't make us stop trusting doctors. He said it ought to be the same way with God. It ain't no matter what has ever happened to anybody. We ought to still be able to trust God. He said that. And when the doctor has done all that he can do, we ain't got but one hope left and that is only trust in God. So you can't do away with trusting God because that's all we got left when the doctor runs out and the the medicine runs out and there is no hope and and all we got left is to trust God. He said, "See, so we got we can't just say we're going to trust him, but we really have to trust him." How many believe that? &gt;&gt; He said, "And to trust God," he goes, "Sometimes you just have to disturb him. You you you got to disturb him until you can see him come in. That's what these disciples did. He said, "Can't our prayers disturb God? Can't our prayers waken him from his rest and bring him on the scene?" I don't know about you tonight, but sometimes we just got to not be afraid to disturb God. I know God, he's busy. And I know God's got something else going on tonight. And I I know he there's a lot of meetings. There's a lot of church services. There's there's many people around the world that have great needs that are crying out to God. And you know what? I just don't want to bother God. I I don't want to go through all that. But he said, "But if you really want to get something from God, sometimes you just have to not be afraid to disturb him, to wake him up and and pray to God and be persistent about it and say, "God, I need you. And Lord, I know you may be busy and I I know you're a great God and I know you have a lot of things that you have to do, but God, I have a need and I I need my needs met and I God, I may not be worthy, but it's okay to disturb God." &gt;&gt; He said, "You call upon the Lord." He said, they cried out, "We're perish. We're perishing." And he moved in on the scene. He said, "And now we can do the same thing." &gt;&gt; How many believe that? &gt;&gt; They were perishing. And they said, "Do you not care that we perish?" He moved on the scene. He said, "And you've got a right to do the same thing. It don't matter if your boat's sinking. It don't matter if everything's falling apart around you, but you've got a right to say, Lord, I perish. I need thee in this hour." And he'll come on the scene for you. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. See, when it comes to a promise of God, we can't be afraid to approach God. Can I tell you what the Bible says? Paul, think about the promises of God. Paul said they're not to Jesus when he came. It wasn't yes and no and maybe might you might get it or you might be good enough. He said, but when it comes to the son of God, Jesus Christ, he was not yay and nay, but in him was yes. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; For all the promises of God in him are yes, and in him, a man unto the glory of God by us. In other words, you know what that means? It means God gave the promise. Jesus confirmed it. You said amen or so be it to the promise of God. And now God gets the glory for all of us. &gt;&gt; You say God gets the glory for his promise. What kind of glory does God get from a promise of God? Can I just tell you tonight? I'll tell you the glory God gets. God gets the glory that he gave a promise to a believer in the midst of Leodysia and you believed it anyway. God gets to glory that in the in the age of spiritual doubt, in the age of of spiritual criticism, in the age when the Bible has been reduced to just a good story book and when the when a church has been reduced to a a social gathering and when the supernatural has been reduced to impersonation, but yet there's still believers that stand upon the word of God and say, "Lord, I believe and I trusted you." Amen. &gt;&gt; Said, "You stand on the promises of God. God gets the glory cuz there's believers that are still standing upon the word of God." &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; See, but I think sometimes the greatest struggle is not knowing how to receive the promises of God. &gt;&gt; There you go. &gt;&gt; Come on. &gt;&gt; It becomes a great struggle. You know why? Can I Can I just preach? I'm home anyway. I feel good, brother. &gt;&gt; You know why? Because we put stipulations on the way that we petition God. &gt;&gt; Many times when we pray, you think about how you pray. You know, somebody goes to mistreating you, you know, you really want you ever had somebody you just really like to choke them. &gt;&gt; Come on. &gt;&gt; You know, they I mean, I'm just being honest with you, but you just you really want to choke them, but you can't do that because you're a Christian. You know, so you're always I I feel like Paul right now. He said, "There's this war. There's this spirit within me. It's waring my members." You know, sometime part of me wants to choke you, but the other part of me wants to say, "God bless you, brother." And just put a smile on your face. But you know, sometimes people they do things to you or say things about your cause and you know, brother Mark, you really you really want to get after them, but but you can't do it because the Bible says you got to pray for them and you got to love them. And so, you know, there there's this war within my members. &gt;&gt; Come on. &gt;&gt; I don't want to choke you. And so that I I you know, the Bible says pray for them. So then we go we go praying to God. Think about how we pray. So you know you're going to pray for them and God's going to God's going to fix this. So you go to pray. You kneel down trying to muster up the word. Listen, man. I don't know if I can pray for this lady or not, you know. I mean, come on now. You know, so you have to you have to get yourself in the spirit to be able to even pray for him because you're all worked up. I know how it is. &gt;&gt; Come on. &gt;&gt; So, you finally you get to where you can pray for him, Brother Mark. And all all of a sudden, you you you got to pray and you say, "Lord, make this lady be nice so I can stand her." &gt;&gt; Yeah. Come on now. &gt;&gt; That ain't that ain't praying for her. &gt;&gt; Come on now. &gt;&gt; Lord, take this person out of my life. &gt;&gt; Come on. &gt;&gt; That I can go through another day. I mean, you know, that ain't that ain't praying for her. &gt;&gt; Lord, can you fix them and help her where she wouldn't have a bad mouth? That way, I can stand be around her. I don't want to slap her every time I see her. &gt;&gt; Come on. &gt;&gt; That ain't praying for her. &gt;&gt; No, sir. &gt;&gt; See, see, but that ain't how we that ain't how we that ain't how we pray to God. See, most of the time whenever we pray, a lot of times when we pray, we ask God, Lord, I I need you to do make this happen like this. I need this to be able to to to happen this way and that to be paid like that. I need that done like that. And we give God all these stipulations for our prayer and then wonder why God ain't doing it. &gt;&gt; Come on now. Come on. &gt;&gt; See, but God don't run errands for us. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; See, so that ain't the way he answers prayer. So, so, so, so many times we ask God for things, say, "Well, God didn't answer my prayer." But can I just tell you something? God can't do things like you asked him to do it many times because God knows that the very thing he's teaching you through that trial, you can't be taught if he pulls the plug on. &gt;&gt; So, God knows he's teaching you something. You know why? We He knows there's things that you must go through in order for God to get you where you need to be. And it's God that's leading us. And and so we have to trust God knowing that God knows all the end from the beginning. He knows all things. He knows what we have need of. He knows your struggles. He knows the trials. He knows the very image that he's molding you into. God knows what it takes in your life to get you to where you need to be. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; And when the time is right, God moves. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; So, you know, sometimes even though we don't think God's answering and God's doing something for us, but the whole time, God really is. He's working behind. That's why I say trust God. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; You have to trust the Lord. But see, sometimes even even when God says yes and he gives us a great promise, sometimes it's so hard to believe. This is what brought me to this thought tonight here. When Zacharias, you remember the story of John the Baptist, Zacharias and and Elizabeth, they had uh his wife was barren. She they were they were they had prayed there all ever since they had been married for a child. She wasn't able to have children. There ain't no telling how many nights that they had spent praying knowing that you, you know, it was such a meaningful thing to have children to carry on their family lineage and it had no ability to have child or have children. And and so they had prayed all these nights. I think of all the nights they laid up and prayed and asked God to do that for them and ask God that he would touch her body and the Lord would give her a child. And I wonder how many times and I really mean this. I wonder how many times that Zacharias, he was a priest in the house of in the temple of God. I wonder how many times Zachcharias quoted to God about Abraham and Sarah here. You know, Lord, you done that for them and Abraham and Sarah and they and they didn't have they they prayed all that time and didn't have a child and you and you you you touched her and you gave them a child, but what about us? I I thought all the times that he had claimed and prayed and asked God to do something supernatural in their life and God never done it. &gt;&gt; Yeah. Come on. Come on. &gt;&gt; And it got to a place and you can tell by reading the story that it got to a place that Zacharias wasn't praying that prayer anymore. Come on. &gt;&gt; It had been a long time since he prayed it. It was something that that he just gave up on. They asked the Lord for it. They they asked God to move. God never done it. It just became an old prayer. And one day, the Bible tells us here, Zacharias was in the temple. He was doing the work of the Lord. And when he was doing the work, an angel appeared unto him. And the angel said, "Fear not, Zacharias, for thy prayer is heard, and thy wife shall bear thee a son." I thought, "Isn't that an odd thing for him to just show up and say, "Thy prayer is heard." And here, you know, Zacharias may have thought, "Well, I've been praying for years. Uh uh but but but now you're past time." And but the Bible says, it tells us he didn't even believe that it could happen. He said, "I'm an old man. My wife is well stricken in years. That was something we prayed about a long time ago. We're we're too past that. We're we're far beyond that. My but but but the Bible, you know, the when God does something, he's doing something in his own time." And so so here you've been praying all this time. I'm an old man. I'm well stricken. And he said, but Zachcharias, he was a good man, a holy man, a righteous man. He had prayed for these things, but he failed to believe what he had been praying for when his prayer was answered. &gt;&gt; So, see, in brother said, isn't that like most of us today? He said, you pray and when God comes to answer your prayer, it would about scare you to death that God came and answered it. That's about how the way that people pray to God. It would about it would about startle them that God done something supernatural in their life. But, but but this is what happened to Zachcharias. She had prayed so long. God never done it. And when God finally came, he said, "Your prayer has been heard." I thought, "My hero, it may have been 20 years ago that he prayed that prayer." But God's always on time. He said, "Thy prayer has been heard. &gt;&gt; Come on." &gt;&gt; But he said he couldn't believe it. You've been, you know, just like us. Many times you pray for healing and it comes and we doubt that God heal us and we pray for revival. And you know, Lord, I want to see a revival. I want to see a move of God amongst my children. And we I I know every one of these parents has prayed it. You want to see a great revival in the house of God, but then you come to church and the spirit of God starts moving a little bit. You say, "Not today, Lord. I got to work tomorrow and I can't be here all night. It ain't a good day for a prayer meeting and we just had a meeting and all all these things. We pray for things, but then when God comes to answer the prayer, I wonder how we respond to God's response." &gt;&gt; Come on. &gt;&gt; Says, "See, see, we're we're waiting on the Lord." He said, "Notice what the angel said. The angel, he said unto him, I am Gabriel that stood in the presence of God." &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. and I have been sent to you to show you these glad tidings. It I I mean I don't know if Gabriel could be offended, but if he could, I would think he got offended. &gt;&gt; I You mean you've been praying for this for so long and then I come and get tell you your prayer is answered. Your petition has been heard by God and God has given you the answer to your prayer and now you won't believe it. He said, "Do you realize who I am? I come from the presence of God and I came here to give you glad tidings. I I didn't come to to destroy you. I didn't come to to bring destruction. I I came to give you good news. You I didn't come to bind you. I I didn't come to to bring problems. I didn't come to to control you, but I came to preach glad tidings to you. I came to give you something that would help you. I'm trying to help you. You've been praying to God. You're reaching out to God. You're asking for an answer, and God sent me to tell you, "Thy prayer has been heard." &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; How would you respond? &gt;&gt; Listen what he done. The Bible says he spoke to Zachcharias, "Thou shalt be dumb." In other words, you'll not be able to speak. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; "Until the day that these things be performed, because you believe not my words which should be fulfilled in their season." &gt;&gt; See, even though God heard the prayer, he made a promise to answer the prayer. I think of this here now when whenever Zachariah's answer came, look at what happened in his life. The very the very joy of it had been removed. the here his wife now that she would conceive and she would they they would go through the the months of her pregnancy. I you know I wonder if during her pregnancy and these uh the the these months that went on that that here Zachcharias he couldn't talk to her. He he didn't know sign language. This came to him all of a sudden he had no way to communicate with his wife maybe try to write something down. But here whenever, you know, when they finally get to this place when they're going to have a baby, that's a time where they want to h have joy and talk about the baby names and talk about what how they're going to build a crib and how it's going to be in the house and oh, what joy it's going to be and man, well, can't you take him down to the temple and and and raise him up in the right way and all the things that he would like to talk about of his son that was going to be born, he couldn't even enjoy it with his wife. He couldn't communicate about it. He had to sit there in silence for all this time. And then hardship struck her pregnancy. The Bible remember remember her baby wasn't moving in her womb for five months. She stayed in her own home. And here here he was the priest. He he could have offered help. He could have been a help to her. He could have prayed. Now he couldn't even pray to God. He couldn't the very words that remember when he prayed out to God. Now he couldn't even speak those words. &gt;&gt; Preach, brother. Come on. &gt;&gt; Even though the prayer was answered, but the joy of it was gone because of the way he responded to God answering the prayer. &gt;&gt; Here was God was answering it all along. I thought, my what a what a thing it was to wonder if if Zacharias even didn't think that maybe it's my fault finally finally that you know she's finally conceived and and you know I didn't believe God and now my wife's suffering and the baby's not moving. I wonder if he didn't sit there and wonder if God would just punish him because of his unbelief. This is a real man just like you and I. &gt;&gt; That's right. Wonder if he didn't wonder these things about how, you know, the many months of suffering and the questions that must have went on his mind because of how he responded &gt;&gt; to God's answer. &gt;&gt; Many months he suffered in this because of his response to thy prayer is heard. I thought, my you know what, friends, our response matters. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; You know, there was another there was another man in the Bible that heard that same word. Remember Cornelius? Remember when the angel of the Lord, he was praying and asking God to help him here? I'm I'm just going to preach it anyway. Lord, put it on my heart. But but when he was praying and and and the angel came right there in his room, he said, "Thy prayer is heard." Isn't that what he told Cornelius, "Thy prayer is heard." Cornelius was a gentile. He said, "And then the L he said,"Lord, I I I receive it. What would you have me to do? I need a move of God in my life." The Bible says he was a just man, a righteous man. He was a good man, but he was a gentile. &gt;&gt; And here he said, "God, what can I do?" And the Lord told him, he said, "You send somebody over to the land of Japa, to the house of Simon the Tanner. There's a man there by the name of Simon Peter." and you bring him into your house. I thought, isn't it something? He was praying for something and and and God was going to answer his prayer. And so when he when he would he would send him over to the house and they went in there and sure enough there was Peter up on the roof of Simon the Tanner's house and Peter was praying to God and he was getting ready and they were about to come down and he remember he had he went he took a rest and as he was rested the Lord showed him a vision of a of a of a a napkin that had came down and there was these different beasts on it that were unclean and and and the Lord said arise and or the voice arise and kill and eat. Peter said I can't eat those things are unclean. I've never put anything in my body that was unclean. And God corrected him. He said, "Don't you call anything unclean that I've called clean. If I've cleansed it, it's not unclean. So, it's not for you to touch. It's not for you to judge. It's not for you to cast your opinion on it. If I've cleansed it, it's not an unclean thing." And then Peter stood up and as he there was a knock on the door. And as he went down, the angel of the Lord began to speak to him. He said, "When you get down there, there are men that are inviting you to a house of Cornelius. I have sent them to you and you go there and they're not unclean. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; And when Peter opened the door, lo and behold, there stood some Gentiles. Am I what a revel? I just feel like preaching. But what revelation that he had? They weren't Jewish people. They weren't raised in the right bloodline. They they weren't raised through the seed of Abraham. They were old gentile dogs. It wasn't worth nothing in all of Israel. But when Peter looked at them, he said, "I don't know. I don't know a lot, but I know one thing. I will not call unclean what God has cleansed." And the Bible said he went to the house of Cornelius with them. You know what Cornelius done? He invited all of his friends. He invited all of his family. He said, "I don't know what's about to happen, but I know that God said my prayer was answered. I was praying for a move of God. I was praying for God to lead me. I wanted to be closer to God. He told me to call Peter and invite him to my house to be able to speak something. I don't even know who Peter is." &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; He invited his friends and family and they all came in and they went into the house and they gathered together. I thought, isn't it something that here whenever he had prayed for an answer all this time, look how God answered it. God sent him to get a gospel preacher to come in and set up a meeting in his house with all of his friends and family. He invited a gospel preacher down there to stand before the congregation of people and to tell them what God's answer was to Cornelius's prayer. I thought, could not God have just told him when the angel stood in his room, couldn't he have just said there when he raised up in his room and said, "There's a Holy Ghost." It was in the man Jesus Christ. He's been crucified and ascended and he sent it back to the church and it's yours if you'll receive it. Could God not have done it just that way? &gt;&gt; But instead, he said, "You go down and get Peter, get a gospel preacher and bring him to your house and he'll tell you what I need to tell you." So he brought a preacher in the house and he stood in the presence of those people. He said, "I don't know very many things, but I know this one thing that my God is no respector of persons." And when you call upon God and have a need from God and you sincerely approach him, he's a God that is just to answer you. And there's a man named Jesus and he he's he's an intercessor. He's a high priest of your confession. And if you have any need to die, you call upon him, he'll answer your prayer. &gt;&gt; The Bible said why Peter began to preach to them that they received the Holy Ghost before they were ever even baptized. &gt;&gt; The Holy Ghost fell on them. Say what was happening? It was a gospel preacher surrendered to God. It was a people that believed the word of God that that that prayed and obeyed the word of the Lord. They prayed so long. He said, "You go get a preacher and listen to what he has to say and that will be the answer to your prayer." &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Isn't it something how God does things? &gt;&gt; We're looking for some great sign in the sky or some somebody or God to come and give us some great speech or an angel to rise up in the floor. But really what what what what his whole family got Cornelius's family and all their friends, they got an oldfashioned gospel preacher by the name of Peter &gt;&gt; that came in and preached to them about Jesus Christ. &gt;&gt; How he could answer their prayer and help them heal them. He was a healer of all their diseases. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; I'd have loved to been in that service. &gt;&gt; I'd been the loudest one in there. Y'all know that. &gt;&gt; Am I to think how God does it? He said, "I only have one message." said, "God is no respector, but in every nation he that fearth him and workketh righteousness is accepted with him." &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; Said, "See, while he was preached, they were filled." Brother said, "Isn't it something?" They only had one vision and a gospel preacher. &gt;&gt; They had one vision and a bunch of people who were Gentiles that saw one vision manifested and heard the word of the truth. &gt;&gt; How they received life and the Holy Ghost fell on all of them before they was ever baptized. Right? &gt;&gt; One vision in a little gospel preaching. &gt;&gt; He said, "How what ought we do this morning?" &gt;&gt; Come on. &gt;&gt; In the tabernacle, sick and afflicted, the blind, the deaf, the dumb, the sinner, everything. Just think out of tens of thousands of things that God has done, not one time has it ever failed. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; It ought to set our hearts a flame. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; If that group of Gentiles could be filled with the Holy Ghost under one vision and a gospel preacher, then what do you think we can do tonight? Said, "Why spake these words? The Holy Ghost fell on I thought if one done that, we've had the privilege of sitting under a prophetic ministry with thousands of visions that took place just as God said they would. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; What faith we ought to have tonight. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Just takes a v if it took one vision and a gospel preacher. You know, we've had thousands of visions. &gt;&gt; But God, think about God. He's not a wishy-washy God. You know what he done, &gt;&gt; right? &gt;&gt; Even though Zacharias was struggling, &gt;&gt; but God still kept his word. He told him he's going to have a son. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; He still he still kept it. He paid for it. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. But God still kept his promise. &gt;&gt; So I think it matters our response &gt;&gt; to God's response. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; You know, Brother Wayne was preaching over in the Tennessee. We I'd done the Friday night. He done the the Saturday night, the evening services and and Sunday. And then he he was preaching on on on the attitude and how that we want the will of God in our life, but we don't want God to lead us. &gt;&gt; Come on. &gt;&gt; Is it something that but then when when God comes in, we want we say we want God to lead us. We want the will of A might run out of time. We want the will of God. But then when God comes in to lead you, we get all worked up. I'm not so sure how how we can handle that. &gt;&gt; Come on. &gt;&gt; It's what took the children of Israel. How that they seen the supernatural happen every day. They lived under a great supernatural pillar of fire that was leading them through the wilderness. They revival after revival, signs and wonders and miracles that took place. But notice the attitude of Israel. They were always murmuring. &gt;&gt; Every time they'd have a revival, they'd leave out of it murmuring and complaining about something God wasn't doing. Every time God would give them bread, they'd murmur that it wasn't the right kind or murmur that it happened with the wrong person or murmur the right guy wasn't just constant murmuring about everything. So they had the supernatural all the time, but that still yet they murmured about everything. And because of that, they wandered around in the wilderness year after year after year after year because they couldn't get past their own murmurings. &gt;&gt; So, but then look at Paul and Silas when they went into a prison cell here. Paul, they were down in a prison that was dark and cold. There wasn't no supernatural in the prison. There wasn't no There was no miracles. There wasn't no bread being rained out of heaven. There was no water for them. It was a dry old nasty basement prison cell in the middle of in the middle of a of a city. And and but Paul when they stood in there, you know what they done? They began to praise and and give glory unto God. I thought, isn't it something that the Israel their attitude was to murmur and complain? And they were living in the supernatural and they always complained. But Paul stood right there in a prison cell and he lifted his hand and said, "Praise be to God. Isn't our God a great God?" He said, "See, that was Paul's attitude." Had a different attitude. He said, "I glory in my infirmities. I count an honor to win a victory over the devil." But see, when you praise God and your car still broke, when you can praise God and the circumstances are still the same, when you can praise God and your bills still ain't paid, when you can praise God and you still have the same symptoms in your body. That's the kind of That's the kind of man that Paul was. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; He said he praised God. You know why he said he wanted to win a victory? I glory in my infirmities. I I want to win a victory over the devil. You say, "Well, where was Paul's victory over the devil?" Let me tell you where it was. It was that he could praise God no matter what was going on around him. &gt;&gt; That's a real believer today that you can praise God no matter what's going on. That that that you can have a victory. You know why? Cuz Satan wants to rob you of that very thing. Amen. &gt;&gt; He wants to rob you of your victory where you can't get up in the morning and say, "Lord, I thank you for this day. You give us this day our daily bread." You're such a wonderful God. I praise you this morning. Lord, you've never failed me. You may have everything in your life may have fell apart yesterday, but something in the heart of a believer can say, "God, you've never failed me one time. You've led me to this place. You brought me through trials. You put this on my life. You brought afflictions upon me, and you've never failed me one time." &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. That's a victory over the devil. The bride of Christ is a victorious people. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And our victory isn't in our circumstances. Our victory is in our promise. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; We're victorious. &gt;&gt; Absolutely. &gt;&gt; You say, "Brother Matt, I tell you what, I'm trying I'm just trying to live a peaceful life." No, sir. &gt;&gt; I'm not I'm not trying to have all this trouble and problems. &gt;&gt; I don't I'm not trying to have all these trials. I'm just trying to live a peaceful life. And because of that in our mind that whenever we whenever it's not peaceful then people get upset at God. &gt;&gt; Then they don't come to church. I they start laying out of church. &gt;&gt; They stop praying. They stop reading their Bible because they get upset with God. &gt;&gt; Because because I don't have this peace I've been promised and you know all these things. But the reality is it's just because people misunderstand what the promise of God is. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; You know I know how it is. You know, brother Matt, the Bible said that the thoughts of God are of us are of peace and not of evil. That's right. It does say that. But that ain't the end of the scripture. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; What Jeremiah said, he said, "I know the thoughts I think toward you, they are thoughts of peace and not of evil to bring you to an expected end." &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; So, whenever he talks about these thoughts of peace, you realize he was actually speaking of your eternal destination. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; God was talking about bringing you to a place of peace and a place of rest. See, how can a man ever have peace in this life? Can I just be honest with you? How can you have perfect peace in this life? &gt;&gt; I know y'all you may think I think I'm crazy, but I can tell you what Brother Beam said. He said, "You can't say that tonight. I feel perfectly well." He said, "You can't even say that because you can't feel perfectly well." &gt;&gt; Come on now. &gt;&gt; How do you know that your mother's not dying right now? How do you know that that your dad didn't kill just a few minutes ago? He goes through things, things that's happened. How do you know that there aren't bad things happening at your home? How do you know your house ain't on fire? How do you know your car is going to start when you get in it? How you know your tire is not going to get flat when you go out in the parking lot? You can't have a perfect peace in this life. Every time your loved ones leave, you think about it. I wonder if they're going to come back. I wonder if something's going to happen. I wonder because we've seen so much bad. We can't have a perfect peace in this life. You say, well, I I I need that kind of peace. He said, but see, in this life, it's going to always be an unsettled peace. You don't have no peace. He said, because it wasn't meant for you to have peace here. If you had peace here, you would grow accustomed to this world. And God don't want you to grow accustomed to this world. &gt;&gt; He wants you to rest in him. So come to him and then you have peace. He says, "So I don't care what it takes. If you say the Russians are fixing to pull the trigger at this minute, they're sending an atomic bomb." But a real born again Christian has an eternal peace in his heart because he knows who he belongs to. He knows his God. He said there ain't nothing can harm him. Let the bullet fly when before the smoke would ever hit the ground or scatter out across the street until we'd be in the glory with Jesus standing there immortal in his likeness. never to be sick and never to have a heartache, never to have a disappointment. That is our peace. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Our peace is that when we go through trials, &gt;&gt; Bible says we're many of our are our afflictions, many trials, many temptations, many uh things that we go through, but our peace is knowing that God has the end of end result in control. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; That's our peace that we have. &gt;&gt; We have peace believing and trusting in God. You know, I think the hardest thing for people to do I don't have a clock. Somebody &gt;&gt; The hardest thing for people to do is to believe that the word will be fulfilled. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Isn't it easier to believe God did something when somebody tells you about it &gt;&gt; or God is going to do something &gt;&gt; than to believe God's doing something right now? &gt;&gt; Isn't it always that way? &gt;&gt; It's always It's a lot easier to be something in the future, but it's hard to believe God in the season that you're living in. You realize that? But when a word is spoke, a promise of God is spoke, it has a future. It has a past. It has a present. &gt;&gt; The very minute it is spoke, the very next second, it now has a past. &gt;&gt; It has a future, but then it has a present. The present, which being there, there there's going to be same thing with a natural seed. When you put a seed in the ground, that seed starts dying. It has a past. It used to be a seed. It used to be in a in a plant somewhere or a little package somewhere. Now it's in the ground. It it's never going to be that again. It can't go back to it. It's going to it's going to deteriorate in the ground and rot. It can't go back to its old form. It has a future, but then it has a present. &gt;&gt; Come on. &gt;&gt; See, so we're always looking for the right season, but but whenever you look at the life of a promise, you realize the greatest part of that promise is the season of fulfillment. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; It's whenever it's taking place. That's the best part about a promise is when you're getting it. I I could promise you a million dollars and that that'd be a wonderful promise to hold on to. But but whenever you got the million dollars, wouldn't it be a great That's the best time is when you actually got it. Isn't that right? whenever you can hold it in your hand, say, "Man, this is good stuff." But you're holding on to the So, the season of fulfillment is the most rewarding time. But what happens is is a lot of times, the longer you wait on something, you lose hope. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Isn't that true? Am I tell am I speaking truth? &gt;&gt; The longer you wait on something, because of our natural life, you lose hope. This is what happened to Zacharias. He had lost so much faith that when his prayer was answered, he didn't even believe that God was answering his prayer. &gt;&gt; But everything happens in that season. Well, he didn't know. He had prayed all this time. But remember said God was answering his prayer. He said, "I'll say this. God will answer every sincere prayer in his own way." &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; God never leaves a prayer unanswered. He don't he don't not answer our prayer. So, so when you ask God just for something, then you just prepare for the season of fulfillment. &gt;&gt; We should prepare in our heart that this this uh season that will come that we'll receive our reward. when you pray for something, maybe you're praying for a change or praying for direction or praying for somebody, praying for your children, but there there's a season that it comes to pass there. We have seasons of this life, you realize there's a there's a season of suffering, there's a season of glory, there's a season of promise, there's a season of fulfillment. Change comes in a certain season. So, whenever you when you look in the Bible, the many times you can find places in the Bible where God made a promise that it didn't happen for several hundred years. When he promised Abraham, thy seed will will be a stranger. Remember, they're they're going to be brought out with great substance. 400 years they lived in bondage before that season of deliverance came. Same thing happened with Isaiah. He said, "Behold, a virgin shall conceive." It was 700 years before a virgin ever conceived. But the promise was still just as good. See, but but in its season, it came to pass. So, here's what happened in Zachcharias. It p it came around to the season. God had a purpose in his life. It came to the season that that John the Baptist would come and forun the forerrun the first coming of Christ. she would fulfill Malachi the third chapter. And here when they were praying for a baby, brother brother Brian, little did they know that their baby was going to fulfill prophecy. There's no way they they thought that that was something that Malachi had said 400 years, 500 years ago. They they never attributed it to that. They were just asking God for a child. But but but but God had to bring it in a certain season. See, because it took the spirit of Elijah to introduce Christ. John the Baptist would had the spirit of Elijah. and and in order for him to introduce Christ, then the spirit of Elijah had to be on earth at the same time Christ was on the earth. &gt;&gt; So, he couldn't had this child 40 years ago or 30 or 50 years ago. It had to happen in the season that God had purposed it in the beginning. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; I thought that's about the way it is sometimes with us. You realize that there's seasons in your life. There's seasons that we that places that we come from. Can I just tell you what Paul said? I'm I'm going to hurry to get to the end. But Paul said, "There was a time he hath quickened us when we were dead in trespasses and sins." In other words, there was a time that you were dead. Somebody say, "Amen." &gt;&gt; But God quickened you to life. &gt;&gt; There was a time in times past. It was a season of your life. I'm talking about an old season. There's a time past you walked according to the course of this world. There was an old season that you walked according to a spirit that worships the children of disobedience. There was a time when you had conversation in the lust of your flesh. There was a time that only thing that was on your mind was fulfilling the desires of the flesh and the mind. There was a time that you had the nature of the children of wrath even as others. &gt;&gt; But then there came a time Paul said that that season ended. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; He said for God who is rich in mercy. &gt;&gt; For his great love wherewith he has loved us even when we were dead in sins hath quickened us together with Christ. That makes me want to shout all over this building. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Think about even when we were dead in sins. That means while you were living in that season, he said, "But God quickened us together with Christ." It was before he ever seemed like he ever answered your prayer, before you were ever filled with the Holy Ghost. Before you ever gave your heart to God, while you were in that other season, he said, "But then God, who is rich in mercy, while we were dead in sin, he has quickened us together with Jesus Christ." &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; In your season of sin, in your season of unbelief, sir, that's when God quickened a seat. &gt;&gt; Amen. The whole time you thought God wasn't answering your prayer. The whole time you was going back and forth to an altar, running from God, saying, "I can't make it right. I can't serve God. I'll just give up." Year after year, you gave up so many times. And the whole time in that season, God had already answered the prayer. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; All them times you said, "I wonder why God didn't do it then. I wonder why God didn't fill me with the Holy Ghost sin. I wonder why God didn't help me then." The whole time, God had answered the prayer. &gt;&gt; Amen. said in the season he said of he has raised us together made us to sit in heavenly places in Christ Jesus that in the ages to come that we might show the that he might show the exceeding and riches of his grace and his kindness toward us through Christ Jesus. See it's a season of our life. We sent a we spent a season serving the devil &gt;&gt; but then in the right season we begin to manifest another life. &gt;&gt; Yes sir. We had a season of doubt. Now we're in a season of fail. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; We had a season of drought and a season of famine. &gt;&gt; You realize that now you're not in that. You're in a season of prosperity. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; People are afraid to say that because men have abused the word, but that's not a bad word. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; We we are in a season of prosperity. We have a we have a God that that is prospering in our lives. That means the word of God that has been swn into your life. It's prospering. It's growing. It's manifesting. It's producing. We're we're in a season of of prosperity. It's the season of the prosperity of the word. And you realize that in each one of us, that word is prospering and it's bringing forth faith. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; So, can I say this to you tonight? You're not in your season of doubt. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; I'm just going to get real with you. You're not in your season of doubt. That was that was yesterday year's. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; You're not in your season of unbelief. That was a long time ago when you when you was an unbeliever. When you when you doubt you're you're not in that season anymore, but now you're in a season of faith. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; See, and it changes how you receive something when you realize what season that you're in. That's right. &gt;&gt; You're in a season of faith. You're in a season of prosperity. You're in a season of belief. You're you're in a season of believing the the word of God. A season of the seed coming forth. You You realize that we're not in a We're not in a drought no more, brother Mark. We We're not in a famine, but we're in a season of harvest. &gt;&gt; You know, there was a great famine. I'm going to say this in closing. There was a great famine in Israel one day if sister would come. And the, you know, the Bible tells us the story of how how that that Elijah &gt;&gt; had had had brought the or had spoke the word of the Lord. The famine that came upon Israel. Three years they had been in this famine. &gt;&gt; And here that that all this that had taken place and they in this great drought and all all thing had fell apart. And finally at the end of this drought, God comes to Elijah and tells Elijah that that season's over. I'm going to bring rain back to Israel. &gt;&gt; So Elijah, he goes, you remember the story, but he goes and he tells that God tells him that rain is going to come. He went and so Elijah went and he started setting things in order to make preparation for the rain. &gt;&gt; He went to the men and he said, "Somebody go call upon Ahab to tell Ahab that that Elijah's here." &gt;&gt; You remember the man they I I'll just tell it like the Bible tells him, but remember the man that came to came to Elijah? They sent down from Ahab and he was a man of God. Bible said he was a righteous man. He was the man that actually had hid the prophets in the caves whenever Jezebel was killing the prophets. He was hid and fed them and w and gave them water. So here this is the man that comes to meet Elijah. Elijah said, "You go get Ahab, tell him I'll meet him this day." And the man says to him, he says, "I Why would you ask me to do that? You're just trying to get me killed." So because I'm going to go to Ahab and tell him you're here. And then Ahab's going to come here because he has searched far and wide for you. He's sent men into every kingdom of this world asking, "Have you seen this man, Elijah, that's caused so much torture in Israel? He's he's got a there there's actually a warrant out for your arrest. There's a there's a wanted poster in every town where I live, Elijah, with your face on it, and you want me to go tell him that you're here, and when he comes here and he don't find you here, he's going to kill me. And what have I done to you? I helped the prophets." And Elijah made gave him his word. He said, "No, listen. I'm going to be here when he comes. I'll give you my word on it. This day Ahab will meet Elijah. He had fled from him, hid from him. Ahab was a great king, killed by the thousands, great warrior king, had a great army. But Elijah said, "This day, he'll meet me face to face." So, you know, they went and told Ahab, I know where Elijah is. You do? Went down where he was. Bible said he came down. First words out of Ahab's mouth, you're the troublemaker. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; You're the troublemaker. You're the one that's stirring up all this trouble. I've been ready. I've been looking for you. &gt;&gt; And Elijah said, "Well, the Lord told me the rain's going to come. Same God that brought the famine is the God that's going to bring rain." He said, "What you've done?" He said, "You're the you caused all this trouble in Israel." Elijah just looked right at him. He said, "No, sir." He said, "You've caused the trouble in Israel." &gt;&gt; Yeah. You caused it when you brought false gods into our temple. You caused it when you let Balam took the doctrine of Balam and established it over our people instead of the doctrine of God. When you brought false doctrine in the pull pit of God. You caused it. &gt;&gt; Come on. &gt;&gt; You brought the famine. That's &gt;&gt; right. &gt;&gt; Said, I'll tell you what you do. You go get your 400 prophets, &gt;&gt; 450 &gt;&gt; and you bring them up on this mountain and we'll just all meet up there and we'll find out if that God that you've been serving is really God or if the God I'm telling you. &gt;&gt; Amen. That's good. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; So, you know what Ahab done? They were in a famine. They had no choice. People were starving and dying. &gt;&gt; So, he called all the the prophets together. Elijah met him up on Mount Carmel. &gt;&gt; He when he got up on top of the mountain, he said, "I'll tell you what you do. You take your sacrifice." &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; He said, "You call upon your God and let the God that answereth by fire, let him be the God." So, they got up there and they went to cutting themselves and chanting and calling upon their God. Come on down. Light this light this altar. Come on. &gt;&gt; Let light a fire up on the altar. &gt;&gt; Yep. &gt;&gt; Elijah stood back and he said, "What's the matter? Is your God asleep?" &gt;&gt; Come on. &gt;&gt; Why Why ain't he answering you? &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; You're petitioning your God. You're getting no response. &gt;&gt; Why didn't he answer? I thought you had a God. I thought he was a a great God. I You put him in your temples. You put him in all your homes. You worship him every day. &gt;&gt; You spend all your time talking to him and looking at him. And &gt;&gt; come on. &gt;&gt; But why ain't he answering you? Why can't he help you when you really need something? &gt;&gt; Come on now. &gt;&gt; You got the wrong God. You've been packing around the wrong God, the wrong idol. So they Elijah says, "Now says, "Let's just see if our God." &gt;&gt; He said, "I'm the only one left that believes in God. &gt;&gt; I'm the only prophet left." He stood up on that mountain. You know what he done? I love this. Cuz it's in the middle of a famine. &gt;&gt; There ain't no water nowhere. And he takes the last bit of water they have &gt;&gt; and he dumps it on the ground. &gt;&gt; That's it. &gt;&gt; Take barrels of water. that water is a precious commodity. Without water, he he says, "Dug this trench around the altar. Fill the trench up with water. Dump water on the altar. Dump water on the sacrifice. Dump water. Get some more barrels of water. Just keep dumping water on it. Keep dumping water." &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Just so you don't think anything ever happened. And the Bible says that whenever he turned, he said, "God, you're the God of heaven." &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; You sent me here to this mountain, Lord, to vindicate thy word. I've obeyed you, Lord. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; And now I'm asking you to answer. Amen. &gt;&gt; And you know what he done for the day? He came down &gt;&gt; with fire and it consumed up the altar. &gt;&gt; And the Bible says the fire of God, it licked up the sacrifice. It licked up the the the altar. It licked up the water. It licked up the dirt. It licked up the stones. Everything that they laid upon the altar was consumed by the fire of God. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; And then Elijah turned to the men. They had a newfound courage. He said, "These men have been lying to you. All every 450 of them. They've lied to you. They they they've destroyed you. They took the faith of your God out of your life. And the Bible says Elijah pursued them down to the valley and they slew all of those prophets down there in the valley. &gt;&gt; They took their lives and they slew them to that and it raised the faith in the people. I thought, my isn't that what what happens when God answers that there's been liars. You realize there's been liars in your life there. There's been a deceiver in your heart. I'm not talking about 450. The Bible tells us there was 200,000 thousand demons that was released in the river upon and these spirits are are moving around this world. They're lying to the people of God. &gt;&gt; Thousands of demons that lie and lie and lie upon upon God that you can't believe God and you can't receive the promise of God and God done forgot about you and you'll never go anywhere with God and the revival has already died out of your life and you wret you wrecked your pinnacle. &gt;&gt; Come on. Come on. &gt;&gt; And you'll never get back there again. But Elijah said, "They're liars." &gt;&gt; You know what they done? They turned around. They pursued after him. &gt;&gt; That's why the Bible said you had possessed the gate of your enemy. I don't care what enemy it is. And I don't care where he hides. They those prophets had nowhere to hide. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And neither does your enemy. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; When you turn on him and say, "But I have a word from the Lord." &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; I'm I'm in a different season of my life. I went through a long season. I went through a season of doubt. I I spent a years of my life where I turned my back on God. I spent years being backslid. I'm in a different season of my life. &gt;&gt; And Satan, you're a liar. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And I've got a right to receive the promises of God. I'm in a season of receiving God's promises. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; You may have been backsplit. &gt;&gt; I don't care. I don't care what what your story is. It doesn't really matter what the story is. You know what happened. Elijah after God had moved, he c called out to the men. He said, "I hear the sound of an abundance of rain." &gt;&gt; There wasn't a sign of rain. He said, "But I hear the sound of an abundance of rain." &gt;&gt; He told Ahab, he said, "You better get up early this morning. Make sure you get your breakfast, get your stuff packed, cuz you're not going to have time to make it back home before this storm hits. I hear the sound of an abundance." &gt;&gt; So, there ain't a sign of rain anymore anywhere. We've been in a famine this whole time. Elijah went up on the mountain. You know what he did? and he went into a private place between him and God. &gt;&gt; I love how Elijah answers God. God said, "I heard your prayer. There's going to be rain." He went out and he called Ahab. Put his own life in danger to stand before Ahab &gt;&gt; because God said it was going to happen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Now he's standing up there again. He said, "Lord, you gave the promise. I done everything you asked me to do." &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And he sent his servant. He said, "You go out there. &gt;&gt; Come on. &gt;&gt; And tell me when you see rain coming." Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; The servant went out and he said, "Come back." He said, "Elijah, I don't see any rain." He said, "That's okay." He said, "Go out there again." &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Come back and tell me you see some rain. He went out again. Came back and said, "Elijah, I don't see no rain." That's okay. Go back out there &gt;&gt; and look again. Come back and tell me there's rain. He went back out. &gt;&gt; Came back. I don't see no rain. That's okay. Go back out there and look again. Come back and tell me when you see the rain. He went back out. There was no rain. I thought my how he must have began to doubt more time after time. But the Bible says, "But seven times he went out looking for a sign of rain." But Elijah said, "You just keep looking until you see it." &gt;&gt; Come on. &gt;&gt; Isn't that something like God would say, "You just keep looking till you see it." The promise is there. Maybe you can't see it. Maybe maybe you've been blinded by your circumstance or or blinded by drought or something that's been going on in your life. He said, "You just keep looking until you see it." Finally, the servant of the Lord, he came back to Elijah. He said, "Elijah, you ain't going to believe it." He said, "The whale over there by the water. I see a cloud about the size of a man's hand." &gt;&gt; And Elijah, he jumped up and he told Ahab, he said, "You better get home cuz there's a storm coming. God is opening up the windows of heaven and pouring out a water that we can't even contain." &gt;&gt; He got so inspired. It didn't take just a little bitty cloud. And it got enough inspiration under Elijah that he forgot about all the troubles and he outran the chariots back home. &gt;&gt; He got so inspired. But said it wasn't some great big thing. They just seen a little bitty thing &gt;&gt; and it was enough to put enough fire in him to cause him to out. He was an old man that could barely even walk up that mountain. But he raced the horses going back down. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; He said he's just seen a little thing. &gt;&gt; Don't matter who you are. Maybe you're backslid. Maybe you're an unbeliever. He said, "You may have been all scrippled up in water baptisms, everything else, but if you'll let the spirit of God open your eyes and show you a little something, and then you just start from there, &gt;&gt; I hear the sound of an abundance of rain, &gt;&gt; it don't matter you believe on creeds instead of the word, come back to the word." When you just see a little move &gt;&gt; and your faith accepted it, that's what I'm looking for. &gt;&gt; He said, "When we're looking for the coming of the Lord, we look at the Holy Ghost fall in the last days. We look at signs and wonders." He said, "What's taking place?" He said, "That's exactly what God said would take place. &gt;&gt; You may not seen it in your home, but it's going on around you. There's a revival going on. You may not have revival in your heart, but there's a revival going on all around you. We see the supernatural signs and wonders, dead, raised, people healed." He said, "Recognize what it is. It's exactly what God said would take place. Let your faith grab a hold of it &gt;&gt; and say, "I want that, too." &gt;&gt; Come on, man. &gt;&gt; He said, "What did he?" Watch what Elijah done. He said when he accepted it, he said his his life must have been renewed. He outran all the chariots back home just because he's accepted. He said, "Go get the rain barrels out and and I hear the sound of an abundance of rain." He said, "The first little move is all it took." &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; To put Elijah on the run. &gt;&gt; It just took a little move. He said, "Oh, people, if you haven't received the Holy Ghost, the first little tinkle that would say that's the truth, that man's telling the word." He said, "Hurry as quick as you can and go get it. Don't wait. The first little move. When Elijah saw that move, it was evidence. Listen what a prophet said. He said when Elijah saw that move of God, &gt;&gt; this little bitty move, it wasn't some great thing. He said when he saw that little move, he said it was evidence that God had answered his prayer. &gt;&gt; It wasn't no great thing. It was an evidence, a little move. He said, "I wish every sick person in here this morning that feels the Holy Spirit in your presence right now could realize that it's the evidence of a prayer that you pray has been answered in the presence of God." Oh friends, let me tell you tonight, if you just kill a little move of God in this place as God is moving up and down these aisles, it don't take a great move of God that just a little tingle of the move of God is evidence that God has already answered your prayer. &gt;&gt; Run to him. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. and receive your promise. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Won't you stand to your feet to that? &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; He said, "Every man who wants the baptism of the Holy Ghost, if you feel a little grand feeling, say, I believe that's the truth." He said, "You should take that." &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; It's the evidence that my answer, my prayer's been answered. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Raise up your hands and say, God, I receive it now. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; And something will take place. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; That's the word of God. &gt;&gt; Word of God. &gt;&gt; When you feel a little moved, maybe you've been praying about something. Let me tell you what a prophet said. I believe it to be a word from the Lord. Yes sir. &gt;&gt; Said when you feel a little bit of move, how many feels the spirit of the Lord tonight? &gt;&gt; How many's been praying about something? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; He said when you feel that little move, it's the evidence of a prayer that you prayed has been answered in the presence of God. &gt;&gt; So raise up your hands and say, "God, I receive it now." &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Something will take place. &gt;&gt; I wonder how many can do that tonight. &gt;&gt; You lift your hands to the Lord. Say, "Lord, I receive. Lord, I I've been praying. Lord, I I know this is the hour. It's a season of receiving an answer to my prayer. I don't care how hard it's been. I don't care how long you pray. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; I don't care how much trouble that it's been that God brought you through things to bring you to this place. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And he sent a word from the Lord. He said Elijah knew it was an answer to his prayer. He just take a little move. He said, "Oh God, if we could just see only the promise of the word that Christ promised, he told us wherever two or three are assembled in my name, I am there in their midst. And whatever they ask, they shall receive. If we can just see it and then the first move we can move right into it. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; God is promising in his word. Can you step into it &gt;&gt; tonight? Won't you lift your hand to the Lord? Say, Lord, I receive it. &gt;&gt; Lord Jesus. &gt;&gt; Lord, here we are as a body of believers tonight.
