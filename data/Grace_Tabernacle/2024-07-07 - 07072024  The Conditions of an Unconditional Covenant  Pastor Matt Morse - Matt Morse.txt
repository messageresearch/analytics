devil a black eye amen I know everybody's been tired and been working but we come on a Sunday morning we woke up this morning feeling refreshed amen ready to go the Bible says I was glad when they said unto me let us go into the house of the Lord Brother Mark here we come this morning we came with our with our spiritual shoes on we come to receive something from the Lord and amen to draw strength from the word of God Amen how many come to do that maybe you've been weak in your spirit let me tell you a secret the way to get strength is through God's word I believe that I believe that through the preaching of the word God has a source for you to draw strength from you may have been you may have been down you may have been having some pressures and things in your life that's been going on but I believe that we can draw strength by the preaching of the word of God it strengthens us the Bible says it edifies us it encourages us it it establishes us it allows us brother marah to be able to find out our purpose is and I know everybody's worried about the people that's sick in their body but brother said the sickest body in this world is that so-called body of Jesus Christ and the only way to help it is the bomb that God sent which is the word of God and I believe when it's preached it's enough bomb that it'll take all the pressures and trials and things that we face and brother Mark that's what we want to see full and standing to its full height this morning is the body of Jesus Christ let her stand let her stand and be in full strength let her let her be in couraged this morning let her rise to a place that God has called us to that's why we come to preach the word of God Amen to give strength to the Church of the Living God Amen how many say Amen to that how many come to draw strength how many come how many preach with me this morning amen we didn't just come to hear a man we come to hear the word of God and I believe God's word he said there's a gift laying there and the people have the right to be able to pull from that gift of whatever they have need of if you need healing in your body you got a right as a Believer to draw healing out of this service if you need the Lord to come and and speak to you or answer a question that you have in your mind you realize that you have the authority as a Believer to draw that out of this service that the angel of the Lord could come down in this service and meet your very need the things that have been going on for years that you've been looking for God to answer that's the kind of God I serve at least that's how I believe it anybody believe it with me this morning amen won't you give the Lord another hand clap of Praise say he's a mighty God wonderful song brother West when mercy walked in amen you love the Lord this morning amen I just say it's good to be in the house of the Lord and want to say to all those that's been helping over the past couple of weeks may God bless you thank you for the fundraiser and able to do a lot for the young people that's always been a desire on our heart is to be able to have things for our young people to do and uh make trips and different things and uh just another opportunity to be encouragement to them and I believe it's very important I can't think of any other cause that's more worthy any missionary work that's more worthy than our own children amen so I appreciate the efforts and and the work that everyone was able to put in but we just want to Bow our heads this morning before we approach the word of God if if you have a need on your heart I believe that God is here this morning just the the the anointing the presence of the Lord that's moving in the building already and just been a wonderful services that we've been having and we just always come isn't it wonderful to be able to go to a church and and be able to come in expectation because you know the Lord's going to do something that's the way I feel every time I walk in the doors I just believe that God is going to do something Supernatural I believe that the dead will be raised the sick will be healed the the the dumb will be able to speak the blind will be able to see and the lame will be able to walk that's how I believe this gospel I wouldn't stand and preach to you if I didn't believe that God was was a god of his word amen so if you have a need this morning just lift your hand to the Lord and want you just call upon him something just troubling your spirit ask the Lord to come by and minister to our hearts this morning gracious Heavenly Father Lord how we love you Lord and God we're so thankful for an opportunity to come and gather in this house and God a little place that we've made Lord that we would be able to hear the word of God be preached Lord a pull pit that was that was built and established for the purpose of the preaching of the word Lord we ask you Lord that you would take your Liberty this morning Lord in this body of Believers Lord that many that come Lord that that have surrendered themselves as hearers of the word of God and Lord I come to do the same Lord I come as the speaker this morning to surrender myself Lord that that no one would come and hear me but God you'd be able to speak to your children the very words that they have need of and Lord we come expecting the supernatural Lord we expect you to work miracles in our midst Lord and that's what kind of Believers that we are Lord we're we're not just halfway Believers we're not make Believers but Lord we're Believers of your word and God we ask you to come and take your Liberty in this service Lord I pray you would be with each one Lord sister Sandy this morning Lord would you give her an extra special encouragement and a comfort this morning God we ask you to be with each one in the name of Jesus Christ we pray amen amen God bless you this morning we just want to invite you to the scripture and we're going to read out of Hebrews the 13th chapter in the 20th verse and then we'll also read from Genesis the 12th chapter in the first verse we'll give you just a moment to to turn there Hebrews 13 and 20 and then Genesis 12 and 1 amen how many come to have church this morning how many believe that God is able amen I he's just an able God and my not only is is he able you know I say this a lot but he's willing and able it's just wonderful to serve a god brother Mark that that's willing to meet our needs this morning and I believe that I believe that we can come and hear we can hear the Lord be able to speak and it'll build our faith and it'll allow us to go through another week on this journey that we Face called life amen so we want to read out of Hebrews the 13th chapter and the 20th verse Paul says now the God of Peace that brought again from the dead our lord Jesus that great Shepherd of the Sheep through the blood of the Everlasting Covenant make you perfect in every good work to do his will working in you that which is well pleasing in his sight through Jesus Christ to whom be glory forever and ever amen now we also want to read out of Genesis the 12th chapter and we'll read from the first verse Genesis 12 and the first verse down through the fifth verse Bible says now the Lord had said unto Abram get thee out of thy country and from thy Kindred and from thy Father's House unto a land that I will show thee and I will make of thee a great nation and I will bless thee and I will make thy name great and thou shalt be a blessing and I will bless them that bless Thee I will curse them that curseth thee and in thee shall all the families of the earth be blessed so Abram departed as the Lord had spoken unto him and lot went with him and Abram and and was and was 75 years old when he departed out of Heron and Abram took Sarah his wife and lot his brother's son and all their substance that they had gathered and the souls that they had gotten in haon and they went forth to go into the land of Canaan and into the land of Canaan they came and we'll just ask the Lord to add his Blessing to the reading of the word this morning as you as you take your seats just to rest a few moments as we want to speak to you this morning on the conditions of an unconditional Covenant the conditions of an unconditional Covenant amen I just want to take a few moments I really believe this morning that that the only thing that we have Brother David to be able to give us strength is this word amen you believe that that God is able to take something isn't it just something that you can just take a little story sometimes and and the Lord can just uh re reveal some things to your heart and it just changes everything that you've been going through but I want to take a few minutes this morning as of course we read the scripture of Abraham and and and as the the you know the story begins many of you very familiar with the life of Abraham and how that God had started him but I want to take as as God uh began to give a covenant and how that Covenant came into effect uh in into Abraham and of course we recognize that as Believers today as the great Covenant it was the it was the greatest Covenant that God has ever given it was something that uh that would that would be something that we would be able to partake of today and of course we see as we open our our scripture we find that the Bible says that here Abram was a man that was called of God and here of course he was uh the Bible would tell us he was a a man 75 years old and and of course he was he was a righteous man he was a man that may not have been born to great wealth brother Mark he may not had a a whole lot of money he may have not have been of great Fame he he he was in a he was in an area that the Bible would tell us and that that had turned their back on God he was in a a place that had had gone astray from what the the fundamental beliefs of of of what God had had taught his children but uh in the middle of all of that here was a man by the name of Abram and and you know I think something about Abram he may not been a well-known man brother Wesley he may not have been the most popular he may not have been a great man he may not have been a great uh a speaker or had some great pull pit or some great thing he wasn't on all the television shows or nothing like that and but he but but What mattered was it didn't matter that everybody else didn't know who he was What mattered is God knew who he was and he was a man that had a relationship ship with God and I'll just lay that in there this morning before we get started what matters is that you know God and more importantly that God knows you if God knows you you're going to get through some stuff and brother Mark he he was he was a man that that would look around and maybe he would watch as God would would would would you know it just seemed like everybody else received great blessings and everybody else that they were they were prospering in their life and still yet he didn't have a whole lot just a little family and a little little flock and a little uh group of of people there that he had that he had sold he had taken and and but you know just seemed maybe he wasn't the greatest one of all but but you know what Abraham I believe that Abraham was a man that never complained about what God had given him he was a man that he was so content with God he he just loved the Lord he was a righteous man and he was just God didn't it wasn't just every now and then he was a man that that that just dedicated his life to serving God and he believed God and and and and and you know he lived a life brother Mark that that for 75 years there's nothing written about it there ain't no there you know couldn't been no great things or nothing recorded of great eventful things that happened but but one day everything changed in Abraham's life one day the Bible says that here that God had called him and when God called him brother Jared God called him to take action he come he come down to Abram and and he began to speak to him and he told him to get out of your country and get away from your Kindred and away from this place and I want you to go into a lamb that I'll show you and I'm going to make of you a great nation and and you notice what God as God came and he and he gave gave him a promise but in order to possess the promise that God gave him brother Wesley that he that God had to call him to separate from all the things that he had already been a part of and you know what you know when he when he left brother Mark he left his brother and he he left nahor and milka and and all all all this family and he went out into the Wilderness and it wasn't long that he got out there in the wilderness here he took lot his brother's son and and when they got out in the wilderness lot looked out and he saw Sodom and he desired what was in Sodom and Abraham he allowed him to go up there and he just took the little planes and and brother brma say it like this he said he just separated from everything he he was just a man that he totally separated from all things I thought isn't that the way it is that when God gives you a promise what God in order for you to receive a promise God requires you to separate from some things you see so so Abraham he separated he went he went out and he took the way with the Lord's despise few and and and you know what he said that ought to be our attitude this morning is to take the way with God people regardless of whether it's hard or easy how many say Amen to that we ought to take the way with God's people we ought to be ready to go at any time wherever that God may call you friends it's God that is calling you let me tell you a secret this morning that if you want to grow spiritually it requires separation a spiritual growth it it ain't sometimes it's all the time in order for you to have a spiritual growth it always requires you to separate it may be separating from unbelief it might be separating from from Idols it might be separating from Traditions it might be separating from family traditions or some theology or some some old church teaching or something but in order for you to have spiritual growth you must you must uh take part in separating from things brother Mark you had to cut things out of your life you had to you have to take things that are holding you back and you have to cut them out you have to take things that that take that Rob you of your time and you have to cut them out if you want to have spiritual growth this morning then you must have separation are you hearing me this morning if you want to grow in God then you must have separation you must be willing to take some things out of your life let me tell you what he did to Abraham he called Abraham and he asked him he said separate yourself from all that you have and come over into a Strange Land brother B said that's what Christianity is he said it's going into a Strange Land that you know nothing about it it's to walk into a land separating from the things of this world because God has called you it's going into a land and and dwelling among a people that you may not know nothing about why because you're a pilgrim and a stranger and you're called of God let me tell you friends this world is not our home we're Pilgrim how many pilgrims do we have here this morning this world is not my home I may be in this world but I'm not of this world and God has called me to separate from the things of this world he's called me to be a pilgrim and a stranger in this world my Bible says it here there is no continuing City but we're seeking one to come every city in this world it'll be destroyed brother Mark everything that you build it'll be destroyed every house you by it'll you may as well just look at it all all the houses and all the lands and all the cars and all the wealth that we build up in this world you can look at it you can say it ain't nothing but hay and stubble you look at the house it's hay and stubble you look at the car it's hay and stubble for one day it'll all burn and it'll all be destroyed it'll never stand the wrath of God but let me tell you friends if you could open your spiritual eye this morning you would see that the Kingdom of Heaven is at hand isn't that what John said he said the Kingdom of Heaven he's walking Among Us there's a kingdom that is coming upon this Earth brother Wesley it ain't like the world that we live in it ain't filled with crooked politicians it ain't filled with lying preachers it ain't filled with false churches it ain't filled with systems of the world that are made to gain wealth it is be filled with one thing it's the spirit of almighty God and the revelation of Jesus Christ has opened the eyes of the believer to see the Kingdom of Heaven is coming down upon the Earth that we live in he called him to separate from things of this world but notice after separation then there come a revelation see you you want to grow with the you want to grow with God and grow in his word and the only way to grow is to separate because the Bible says after Abraham separated from lot and lot was separated from him then God said to Abraham lift up your eyes and look from the place that you you are and you look to the north look to the South and look to the East and look to the West isn't it something brother Cody after he separated from all those things that God had called him to separate from then God be to reveal to him what was his when he went into the land Brother David he was walking he was walking by faith he didn't know where it was he said you go to a land that I will show you but once he had that period of Separation God said now you look North that's yours you look South and that's yours look to the East and that's your look to the west and that's yours from River from River to Sea that's all that belongs to you this land that you see I will give it unto thee into thy seed forever see it was after separation that the Revelation came many times you say well I want to know what God has for me what what promise God has laid in there for me but go ahead and follow the plan of God and separate from the things of the world you would say well I just don't see like I'm grow for I'm going to preach anyhow I don't feel like I'm growing I don't feel like I'm getting anywhere with god well go ahead and separate from the things of the world and let the revelation of God strike your heart I can't get any farther I read my Bible it just seems like I'm getting nowhere I I go to pray it just seems like the prayer is going nowhere brother Matt what do I do separate from the things of the world and the things of your past and all the things that you've gone through you make a total separation and become one with God and let the revelation of God strike your heart but let me tell you what happened Brother David it it didn't happen right away God gave him the promise you know what happened the next few years they were troubled years in the wilderness in the plains there was great Wars that broke out nation was fighting against Nation kings that came they went down into Sodom and they they they took captive the the people there they took lot into captivity Abraham he went into battle he armed his servants and he went out into battle remember in the in the slaughter of the Kings and he went back and took everything that belonged to him and his loved ones and and he brought them back into the fold and the Bible says but then whenever they would come to give him a reward that Abraham would turn he'd say I don't want to anything from you I don't want anybody to think that that you're the one that that that that made me and I don't I don't I don't want to think that I'm the one that built this up and he he said I just want to be one that would follow the will of the Lord and then let God pour out the blessing how many say that this morning just let me follow the will of God and let God pour out the blessing you realize friends what God does sometimes he takes you down a path just so he can show you that it's he the one that's doing it it's he the oh don't ever let us get to a place that we can look out at our church this little church get started with just a handful of people and now we're you know growing up to close to 200 people that that claim this church as their home church but brother Mark don't ever let us get to a place that we would stand in a pull pit and think we done something to cause it cuz it ain't got nothing to do with with us we just want to walk in the will of God and let God pour out the blessing you want to see your ministry grow walk in the will of God and let God pour out the blessing you want to see your walk with god grow walk in the will of God and let God pour out the blessing he said I just want God to do blessing I I I'm not going to take what you have to give me I'm not going to take this there was all kinds of people trying to give him all kinds of things let me bless you this way Abraham let me bless you this way Abraham he said no I won't take any of it I just want to walk in the will of God I I want to know at the end of the day that it wasn't me and it wasn't you I want to be able to lay my head on my bed at night and know it was almighty God that has established me that placed me that called me that gave me the promise and kept his word let me know that it was God that done the work you know what happened brother Joe when he went home the Lord came to him he said fear not Abram he said for I am thy shield and thy exceeding great reward my a there something he wanted to let him know you didn't take all what the world has to offer there's many offerings that go well take this and I'll make it a little easier on you take this you know that's what the Oh Glory that's what the devil does he he'll give us a little pills to pass Us by take away a little bit of pain and make it through to another day help out with our anxiety help out with your depression but let me tell you friend I ain't looking for the devil's pill I'm looking for the reward that come from almighty God he said I am thy shield and thy exceeding great reward remember brother B telling the story when he went out he said there was a man he looked all all around him he said I want everything you see that way I want everything you see that way I want everything you see that way he said you know got the thinking this man had all these great things but you know I don't have a lot of that but the spirit of the Lord be to move upon him and he looked up in the air he said how about anything up there do you own anything up that way oh I thank God brother Mark that the real estate that we have is the possession of Heaven and Earth he said I am thy reward he said look up this is our reward it's eternal life oh friends let me tell you this friends you may not be wealthy you may not have great things but what really matters in this life is that you have the spirit of God with you it's the greatest treasure that you can ever possess to think that the king of glory would walk with you what other Comfort did Abraham need for the king of glory walked with him arm and arm it was God that spoke to him that spoke to his heart when he needed a comfort God was there when he needed a helper he was there when he needed healing he's there when he needed Fellowship he was there it is God that walks with you I can't think of a a greater treasure in all the world than to have God walking with you can you imagine what greater treasure brother Jared that when you're going through a great trial that God would whisper in your ear saying don't worry I've got this all under control when you feel like giving up that God would come by and take you by the hand and say it's okay this is all my doing I allowed this to happen I wanted you to draw strength from it I'm just trying to strengthen you and exercise your you're walking your faith muscles this morning no matter what he went through brother Mark God was there and notice what he done Abraham like we do he got to looking around at the conditions that he was in he had the promise from God but he got look around he went home and got look around his house he said God but there's a problem he said I don't have a son you promised me all this seed and all this sons and Stu in this great nation I don't have a son the only person there is to carry on my name is the son of a servant that I have in my household that was born in my house so he get to talk about thought isn't that the way we do sometimes just looking around but notice what God said he saidwell I well I go childless and God came to him he said' no Abraham this shall not be thine Heir but he shall come forth out of thine own bows he shall be thine Heir see sometimes we look at our condition brother Mark is this my inheritance sometimes we look at our problems is this what God promised me is this what Abraham was doing is this what God has given me is this my inheritance is my sickness my inheritance is my is high blood pressure is it my inheritance it's bad temper is it my inheritance are these problems is my condition is this my inheritance is this what God promised me but God didn't allow him to stay on that thought very long but sister Nish came right in he said this this ain't your inheritance he said but you're going to have a seed it a it ain't going to be some stepchild but it'll be a seed that come from your own bouth cuz I gave you a promise and I'll fulfill my word let me tell you friends you may inherited a lot of things from your Earthly father but let me it didn't come from your heavenly father from but your heavenly father he gave us a different inheritance you know what God done brother Wesley he took him on the walk in the middle of the night that makes me want to preach all over this building he took Abraham when he looked at his condition and he thought God I can't fulfill the promise that you made for me cuz I don't even have a son how can I have a great nation I don't even have a child I ain't even got the first one how can how can they be such a great thing but God took him by the hand and out into the middle of the night he went and he looked up in the stars of the heaven he said Abraham I want you to look up in the stars and tell me can you count them oh can you imagine God standing there as he said yeah Lord there's one there's two there's three 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 how many should I count just keep counting Abraham 11 12 maybe he counted a few hundred but he said Lord I can't count all these that's what I'm trying to tell you Abraham for thy seed shall number the stars of the heaven thy seed shall be great oh friends let me tell you what God does sometimes go out and count the stars and so shall thy seed be he took him on a walk brother Mark oh what makes me want to preach he took him on a wall through the promised land he said ca he was in the land that God had promised him and he walked out and he said number the star here is he was standing in the place that God was going to give him he said but the seed that you'll have will number the stars of the heaven you know what he done brother Wesley he went walking through that promise I I could imagine the next few nights every time Abraham got to fing a little bit down what he would do he'd walk outside of his tent and go out there and just go to Counting Stars when he fell Li he couldn't go another day brother Cody you know what he could just go outside this is where the Lord told me and he just counting stars hey hey Sarah where did I end off last night I don't know is at 3 or 4 th000 but let's pick it up again tonight and say start over there by the Milky Way and keep counting stars why because God had promised him something and he took him on a walk to remind him of the promises that he gave I don't know about y'all it makes me makes me feel like preaching I wish somebody else did it makes you it makes you feel good to think of God when he would take you on a walk brother well that's what we need this morning what you need is you need to get out of the tent and go out in the dark somewhere and let God take you on a walk through the promises that that he gave you let it revive your spirit let it revive your heart let it revive your faith get you out of that old dead condition that can barely get out of bed in the morning so lazy barely even go to work but I thank God that he could take us and remind us of our promises let him take you on a walk this morning Through the Bible Lord take me on a walk through my promise and let and remind me what it is that I have stop over at 2 Samuel he says Sovereign Lord You Are God your Covenant is trustworthy and you have promised good things to your servant come over by Isaiah 54 let him say for the mountains shall depart and the hills be removed but my kindness shall not depart from thee neither shall the Covenant of my peace be removed sayeth the Lord that has Mercy on thee let him take you over to Psalms 34 but Mark taste and see that the Lord is good and blessed is the one that takes refuge in him let him walk you over to Isaiah 40 he is anybody hear me this morning let him walk you to Isaiah 40 it is he that gives strength to the weary and increases the power of the weak how many you take a walk with the Lord this morning Lord take me on a walk through the pages of the Bible Lord let me see what my promises are Lord let oh could you take me through this Lord I know that's what I have need of this Lord could you help me this morning but Mark go over into Isaiah 41 where God would say do not fear for I am with you do not dismay for I am your God I will strengthen you I will help you and I will uphold you with my right hand that's what we need you need to walk with God through the promises of the Bible don't ever fear for I'm with you don't be dismayed for I your God I will strengthen you I will uphold you I I will I will hold you with my right hand and then take you a turn right over into Isaiah 43:10 and let him tell you when you walk through Waters don't worry I'll be there with you when you pass over a river it'll not overtake you when you walk through the fire it'll not devour you for I am the Lord thy God it's no wonder David said yay though I walk through the valley of the shadow of death I'll fear no evil for thou are with me and I rod and my staff they comfort me let me tell you friends the rod of God is his word and if you could take a hold of the rod of God or the Word of Promise that God has given you you can walk through every trial you can walk through every problem you say brother man I don't know how I'll ever walk through the fire how can I walk through the river I don't think I can go through another trial I don't think I can make it through another day well thank god brother Wesley it ain't got nothing to do to your thoughts won't you step over into Jeremiah 29:11 he said the thoughts I think toward you are thoughts of peace and not of evil to bring you to an expected end I thank God it ain't my thoughts he's concerned with anyhow it's God's thoughts he turn with that's what we need is a walk through the pages of the Bible again how's he going to do it how can he take me through how can he walk me through how can he take me to another step how could he over help me overcome this trial how can he get me through the fire let me tell you why just walk with me over into Deuteronomy and then find out what God said he said it is the Lord himself shall go before thee he said I'll walk before you I'll never leave you nor forsake you do not fear and don't be discouraged we need to walk through the the pages of the Bible to remind us who we are and where we came from and the promise that God has given us and when you get done with that walk you know what you do you do what Abraham done the Bible said after he came back from Counting Stars the Bible says he believed God After You Walk Through This Promise he said he believed God and it was counted unto him for righteousness brother West we we take a walk Walk Through the Bible we believe the Lord he said where but Lo notice he said just like us cuz we're flesh he said Lord whereby shall I know that I shall inherit it you know sometimes you can ask good questions it ain't bad to ask questions it's the motive of the question that makes it good or bad this was an unbelieving Spirit it was kind of like what Mary had when the angel came to her she he she said how can this thing be said the the Holy Ghost overshadow you and bring forth a child well that ain't no good answer can you imagine a carnal mind thinking of that well that that still didn't make sense to the carnal mind but you know what she said she said be unto me according to Thy word see the answer was good enough so if you ask a question take the Bible answer if you want the take the answer may not make sense but take the answer be it unto me according to Thy word it'll always work out he said this is how you'll know God begins to confirm the Covenant that he made with Abraham you know what we do today but I'm Mark we go and we we shake a hand say brother this is what I'll do this is what you'll do and your hand shake God Bless you that's what we'll do and we just both do our part that's the Covenant that we make one with another that's good enough but in the days for for honest men that's good enough for believers that's good enough for Christians that are it's good enough they still do that but in the days of Abraham it wasn't that way they made a covenant in the Eastern countries they had to kill a beast they stood between the the dead pieces of the Beast and they rode on a parchment of lamb skem whatever it was and that was the Covenant that they made and over the dead body of the Beast they took an oath that if they broke the Covenant to let them to be cut into pieces like the dead Beast was so this was the this was The Vow that they made so here Abraham asked God he said well how shall I know this shall be and this is what God told him he said I'm going to make a covenant with you he said go take a hepher and a and a goat in a real and he took them took them out all the animals and he divided them up in the midst and each piece against another but when the sun was going down the Bible says and a deep sleep fell upon Abram and a of great Darkness fell upon him and it came to pass when the sun went down and a smoking furnace and a burning lamp passed between those two pieces and in the same day the Lord made a covenant with Abram my is it something that here when he was wondering how God would would take him through and how God would fulfill his promise God came and said but I'm going to make a covenant that it'll be fulfilled now how many knows what a covenant is it's a promise or a vow or a contract between one man and another many places in the Bible we find we find God makes covenants with men and the the very first one coming the Book of Genesis when he made it with Adam remember don't touch this this tree and if you live if you eat of this one the tree of knowledge you shall surely die it was the it was the adamic Covenant that God made with him in the book of Exodus we find another Covenant called the Mosaic Covenant that God had made with Moses he said he said when he told them he made the Mosaic Covenant in the wilderness but notti as soon as God made it with them this is a law that they must keep they broke the Covenant and here we find this to be the case that every time that God makes a covenant with men men always fail to do their part are you hearing me men always break the Covenant so when God makes a covenant men it ain't going to be long they're going to break the Covenant that God makes I thought isn't it something here that whenever God had made him a a covenant brother Mark it didn't take them long in the wilderness they broke what God Said and would have been a failed nation had had had God just held that over them it would have all failed but God being an eternal God knowing that they would break that in the wilderness God being an eternal God knowing that they would fail in the wilderness and they wouldn't keep the law of God and they wouldn't keep the order of God he knew they wouldn't do it so before they ever went in the wilderness Glory it makes me feel good before they ever went into Egypt before Moses ever came in and brought them out brother Mark before any of it happened God had already made another Covenant with Abraham in Genesis the 12th chapter and when he made this one brother Mah it wasn't like that old covenants that God made it wasn't a covenant of law but brother said this Covenant he said the whole Covenant of Abraham was a complete Covenant of the grace of God the Abraham Covenant it wasn't if you'll do a certain thing I'll do something but Abraham was called by election nothing that Abraham done he said see in Genesis 18 He said see that Abraham shall surely become a great and mighty nation and all the nations of the Earth shall be blessed in him for I know him that he will command his children in household after him they shall keep the way of the Lord to do justice and judgment that the Lord may bring upon Abraham that which he has spoken of him this is what God says about Abraham Genesis 18 and18 but I want you to notice this this word for I know 18:19 for I know him that he will command his children when you look this word know up in the Hebrew it's the Hebrew word yada which also it means to know but it has another meaning it means chosen so when you read this scripture again it says seeing that Abraham shall surely become a great and mighty nation brother Jared and the nations of the Earth shall be blessed in him for I have chosen him isn't that good for I know him that word know it it's it says chosen for I have chosen him that he will command his children I have ch my isn't that isn't that so much better not only do I know him but I have chosen him that he would command his children I have chosen him that he would he would keep the way of the Lord I have chosen him that he would do justice and judgment I have chosen him that the Lord may bring Abraham all that which he has spoken of him isn't that good it wasn't just that God knew you would do it but it was that God chose you to do it he chose you because he knew you would he was he wasn't based on your efforts he chose you I know I know this is controversial I know when you look at when you read this in the in the church world today it's a controversial subject on the subject of election but let me just let me just make it make it easy for you this morning this is not brother Matt's teaching this come from the Bible out of Romans the nth chapter if you want to read it Paul does a whole message on it he said I say the truth in Christ and I don't lie but my conscience is bearing witness to the Holy Ghost here was a prophet of God God by the name of Paul how many knows Paul he was an apostle a prophet of God he was anointed by God to speak the gospel he said I'm not lying I'm telling you the truth and the W the Holy Ghost is a witness of what I'm saying that I have a great heaviness and continual sorrow that I could wish that I myself for a curse for my brethren for My Kinsman according to the flesh who are Israelites that that that supposed they're supposed to get the the adoption and the glory and the covenants and the law and the service of God and all the promises their fathers that that that whom concerning Christ came God blessed them forever but whenever they came and got it it was of none effect unto them he said but I want you to know this that not all of Israel is Israel he said neither because they are the Seed of Abraham are they his children but the Bible said in Isaac show shall thy seed be called so that means that the it wasn't the children of the flesh for that was the children of God but it was the children of the promise that were counted for seed he said for this Word of Promise he said whenever Sarah should have son not only that but he said Rebecca would bring forth a son by Isaac and while Rebecca was still had her sons in her womb remember Jacob and Esau the Lord spoke unto him he said when they were still unborn they've never done good or evil he said the elders Shall Serve the younger for as it is written Jacob have I loved and Esau have I hated Paul said and that was so that the purpose of God according to election might stand see not of works not of us but of him that calleth he said so Moses said I will have mercy on whom I'll have mercy I'll have compassion on whom I will have compassion he says so the see it's not of him that willth nor of him that runneth but it's God that showeth Mercy can I read this again listen he say so so God's gift is not a question of our human will or our human effort God's Gift ain't a question is if you'll be able to do it brother Mark or or if you'll be able to keep the word or you'll be able to keep the the law or you'll be able to stand for truth it ain't it ain't your ability of what you'll be able to do but his gift his gift is not based on your will or your effort at all but it's only a question of God's mercy so it don't depend on our own willingness it depends on the mercy of God it don't depend on our own ability it depends on God having the ability to have mercy upon us oh let me tell you friends that's what happened with Abraham whenever God called him it was the mercy of God that found a man it was the mercy of God God that called him it was the mercy of God that led him on his way to fulfill the plan of God can I say it like this election is a product of the mercy of God it's a product of Mercy see the law produced many things It produced death it produce judgment it produ it produced the flood in the days of Noah it'll produce a fire of judgment in the end time it was a law of God brother Mah that brought these things to pass but let me tell you Mercy had a play in it too Mercy It produced something totally different when the mercy of God came brother Wesley It produced life Mercy produced It produced celection It produced eternal life It produced something Everlasting the mercy of God that's what found you whenever you were lost in sin it was Mercy that saved you and brought you to the grace of God that when you should have saw the Judgment of God but it was God's mercy that brought you out it was God's hand of Mercy that stayed judgment from your life it's no wonder David said surely goodness and mercy shall follow me all the days of my life friends let me tell you from the time that you were born into this world when you were born into sin and you were speaking lies and you were living in iniquity the mercy of God and the goodness of God was following after you the law of sin and death had you bound the nature of Flesh it ruled over you but then God saw something different he took an image brother Joe was preaching about Wednesday night he took the image of you and he posted on the walls of Heaven he said Heaven's Most Wanted he sent out agents called goodness and mercy and they pursued after you and they searched for you and they followed after you and then he sent an enforcer called the Holy Ghost and he came to where you were and he brought you out of that old condition that you were in and he established you in the path of God brought you out of your condition established you in the word and then he sent you on your way and now brother Travis we sing a different song I'm Bound for the promised land I was bound for hell until the mercy of God found me I was bound for Destruction until mercy found me now I'm Bound for Glory now I'm Bound for I'm Heaven bound the mercy of God brother Market never failed you see the Flesh of your life it's a product of your mother your father this flesh body it's a product of mom and dad carries the natur of mom and dad you see it all over some people you sometimes you see people you I don't I don't know your name but I know your daddy's name I know your mama's name why because they're a product of their mom and dad in this flesh but this new life this new creation is a product of your heavenly father it's a product of the the mercy of Jesus Christ see it was by his Mercy that he chose you it was by his Mercy that he elected Abraham think of it it was the mercy of God that he elected Abraham Abraham wasn't a great man he wasn't doing great efforts you think he was a perfect man I don't believe that I don't believe that for a minute you'll never convince me everything he done was right and everything was perfect for God to call him righteous but he was just an ordinary man but the mercy of God called him he elected him by Mercy look what happened to him brother Mark the children of Abraham because of this mercy of God that was upon them they got into a Egypt down there all bound up and they had to have something that would come to bring them out of that place but listen what every time they got in trouble notice what God would do he would go back to the Covenant that he made why a't that good every time you see I don't have time to go through it this morning but every time you see him in trouble every trial every every every place every battle they'd look back to the god of Abraham or the god of Isaac what were they referring to was the Covenant that God had made with Abraham he's the god of the Covenant he he's the one that made it and brother Mark when they got in trouble they begin to to call upon the Lord and you notice there was only one thing that could save them when the death angel came into Egypt there was only one thing that could save them it was the Covenant that God had made you brother I'm say what kind of Covenant wasn't it was a bloodbound covenant that he made with him and that's what always saved them notice when they went in when the when the death angel came in they slew a lamb and put the blood on the door when they went marching around Jericho what was it that that Rahab hung out of her window it was a Scarlet thread what was it a type of it was a type of the blood of Jesus Christ it was a type of Christ on Calvary since see you recognize all under the blood was saved in Egypt and all under the blood was saved in Jericho and all under the blood is what will be saved today brother Jared that's what the world needs they need to come under the Covenant of almighty God I thank God this morning that he's given us a covenant brother Mark it ain't a covenant of law but it's a bloodbound covenant let me tell you friends that Covenant in Egypt it was only typing something to come that Covenant in rahab's house it was typing something to come but it could never carry forward that that that Scarlet thread it could never carry forward but the Covenant of the blood of Jesus Christ it had a different power than the blood that was the door it had a different power than the blood that or the the thread that was hanging down the wall of Jericho but this Covenant blood of the Lord Jesus Christ it's good enough for your past it's good enough for your present it's good enough for your future it's the only Covenant that God ever made that would go from eternity to Eternity and it would cleanse every one of us and make us to be able to walk upright before almighty God it's a covenant brother Mark it cover oh I I know some of you looking back like I'm strange but let me tell you it'll cover your past sin can I read it to you Paul said Romans 3:25 whom God has set forth to be a propitiation through the faith in his blood to declare his righteousness for the remission of the sins that are passed are you hearing me so I want you to think about this this morning think about all the you don't have to think about all the sins of your past but just put them into one thing call them sins of the past I don't want you walking down that trail with the nightmare but put them all one place the sins of the past and then the take the scripture and apply it to it to declare his righteousness glory to God for the remission of the sins that are passed through the forbearance of God you know what forbearance means it means forgiveness so here the sins that are passed in the Statue of a perfect man Peter would talk about all the things that a Christian ought to have he said but he that lath these things is blind and cannot see a far off and he has forgotten that he was purged from his old sins a man that don't possess these things that God has called a Believer to walk in that isn't walking in his stature in his full stature as a Believer he said that man has forgotten that's what the purpose of Paul WR or Peter writing that was it was to remind you of who you are this is what a Believer must be must have faith and virtue and the knowledge of God and Temperance all these things this is the character of God this is what you ought to have he said any man that ain't walking in that he has forgotten that he was forgiven he was purged of his old sins the sins of the past are covered see brother Mark by the Covenant of God's blood but then watch what Paul says in Colossians 2 what about the ones that are present can I just teach through it a minute he said you being dead in your sins and uncircumcision of your flesh being dead in your sins that's a present uncircumcision of your flesh hath he quickened together with him having forgiven you all trespasses somebody say all with me that means everything all your trespasses es all the things of your past he said he'll blot out the handwriting of ordinances that was against us which was contrary to us and he took it out of the way and he nailed it to his cross all of our sins brother Wesley those that are past those that are present this word all in the Greek come from the come from the word POS Pas it means that all every whole all manner of Thoroughly it refers to completeness that there are no sins that Christ sacrifice did not cover but all all of our sins past present and future they have been nailed to his cross that's why go ahead and you can praise the Lord go ahead we're in church anyway we ain't at a ball game you can be loud here all your sins past present and future have been nailed to the cross that's why Paul could say in Hebrews 13 that the God of Peace has brought again from the dead of our Lord Jesus the great Shepherd of the sheep through the blood of the Everlasting Covenant not only did he send a covenant that would that would that would wipe out all your sins but he made sure that Covenant would never end isn't that good a't that good brother Robert not only did it take them all out all the the past all the all the all the ill things the things you don't want to think of all the nastiness in your past that that you went through in this flesh but God came by and he wiped all of it out and then he made a covenant brother Wesley that would be Everlasting isn't it something he said it's an everlasting covenant not only did he did he make it all but he made it it would last for all time through the blood of the Everlasting Covenant it would make you somebody say me it would make you perfect in every good work to do his will working in you God chose you to do his will God chose you that you would be well pleasing in his side how can I be well pleasing God chose you to be well pleasing how can how can I do good to do his work God chose you to do his work how can I be perfect God chose you to be perfect the blood of his Everlasting Covenant would make you perfect it would work in you that which is well pleasing in his sight through Jesus Christ to him be the glory the blood of Jesus Christ an Everlasting Covenant brother R said isn't it something that was Everlasting I love this but Robert it's not an eternal Covenant it was Everlasting Covenant because there's one day that you'll never need it anymore that Covenant was made because one day when you're redeemed it's all over it's Everlasting means it lastes all through time so as long as there is time time and we're creatures of time this Covenant will be there but one day you won't need the Covenant no more but until time runs out we're going to need it and you'll have it it's an everlasting Covenant that God has made with his children let me tell you friends with God's covenant the the characteristics of this Covenant are so wonderful it a blood Covenant brother Morgan it was an Everlasting Covenant it was sent to the faith seat of Abraham and not only that but it was unconditional you know what that means brother Wesley Abraham didn't do anything to deserve it he didn't do anything to Warrant it the Bible says God chose him I know I know the devil don't like this kind of preaching but it's the gospel TR they call it Feelgood preacher they got they say you're trying to pump people up and all this let me tell you I'm trying to pump the word of God into you that's what I want you to see who you really are that you ain't just some barely Christian that that just found your way one day and it just so happened that that you're going to believe this for a little while but God chose you to be who you are he chose you to walk this wall he chose you to be a believer he chose you to be the Bride of Jesus Christ he chose you to hear his word he chose you to be able to to accept it and to walk in it and to raise your family in it you were chosen by God to be righteous and to walk upright before God it ain't a feel-good message it's the gospel truth you were chose you you need to hear it till you believe it you were chosen by God I'm talking about God an eternal God that looked down from the banisters of Heaven throughout all of eternity and he picked you out of millions of people on this world he said there's my bride she'll believe what I send her I'm going to make her where she'll be established I'm going to make her so strong that when she goes through a trial she can go another mile I'm going to make her so strong that when the fires of the pressure come up on her life she'll be able to rise through it I'll make her so strong that when she feels she'll be have enough faith that she'll be able to raise those up around her I chose her to walk in this age I'm going to make her so strong that in the midst of Le osia she'll still be able to stand I'm going to make her so strong that when her FLH body is so weak that she can't even get up and go to church but her faith will still cry out to God and say God heal my grandchildren God heal my children God moveing the church a she'll be so strong that her faith will still cause her to be a prayer Warrior I'll make her strong I chose you to be just that unconditional Covenant see this Covenant of Abraham it was a type of Calvary notice what came with it and I'm about to close what came with it it was a Promised Land let me show you how much it was like Calvary it was it was a perfect type there was a Promised Land There was blessings didn't know what was promised at Calvary there was blessings the Covenant through faith would extend to everybody is know what he said at Calvary without it there wouldn't be a promise without it there was no election without it there was no inheritance without it there was no adoption without it there was no there was no sunship but listen it was unconditional he didn't have to do nothing for the Covenant God done made that with him he just had to stay put I love brother Brown picks this up he said there ain't one thing that Abraham had to do he said he had to abide in his Covenant he said see we know this the only thing we have to do to inherit any of God's promises is to stay put on God's word that's the condition we have to stay put on God's word and don't let nothing shake you from it this Covenant of Abraham this when we whenever Christ came watch the the Covenant of Abraham was a type of what Christ was going to do at Calvary when he came at Calvary this New Covenant or new testament it showed us that Jesus met every requirement for us that God required to make us back to be true Sons and Daughters of God under the blood of Jesus Christ where there is no more condemnation my just like Abraham's Covenant it made it brother brother Bobby that everything happened just like God said and his land was given to him just like God said and all that God promised was fulfilled he said the purpose of that is so that when you seen what happened on the cross of Calvary you'd be able to take that same thing and apply it to your life and say everything God said it's going to happen it covered all my sins I say Amen it took it delivered me from all my past I say Amen it healed me of my of my broken spirit I say Amen it healed me of my broken body I say Amen there was no more condemnation to them that are in Christ Jesus and notice what he done when Jesus came sister Lori he gave that Covenant to his disciples he said now you go into the world and preach the gospel and out they went taking the Covenant of Jesus Christ what was it they were preaching it was his Covenant the New Testament they were preaching to the world and let me tell you a secret friends we're still doing it today God still has anointed men that has taken his Covenant and preached it to this world it's the it's the elers in the day of Abraham it's the here in the end time it's the message of elaser when Abra sent his faithful servant uh the the the the servant the model servant of the Bible said being sent to hunt a bride for Isaac and that's what we're doing today it's the message of elaser calling a bride for Isaac out of this world not building up some church or building up some name for oursel but the purpose of our ministry is to call a bride to Isaac you realize what we are we are carriers of the message of the hour we are carriers of the message of elaser that the purpose of it was was come out of her my people don't you realize that why God is allowing us to still stand here today and have a pull pit and and preach this very message this morning is because God is not done with Mercy he's still a god of Mercy he's still a merciful god he's still longsuffering and he's still anointing men to take the message of elaser saying would there be one more that would come unto me would there be another follower would there be one more that would lay down your waterp and come and receive the blessings that God has given for them he said God still sends his men with an angel before the church and he goes and he takes the message to the church that's what God still does just like eler done when he represented the father of Christ notice what he done let me tell you about God's men can I just tell you this as I'm closing I tell you what God's men do he said he loaded the camels full of good gifts and he gave them to Rebecca remember what elaser done on the way back she had camell loads of gifts that was given to her said that's what that's what elaser that's what he done then he said there but he never told her that they were for another generation or for another day they were for her cuz she was the bride and that's what God does today every true servant of God that's sent out has got a whole book of divine promises that he can offer to the Bride of Jesus Christ oh friends I don't know you may I may not be a preacher but it sure makes me feel like one when I have a whole book of divine promises that I can give to you I'm not talking about selling somebody something that that ain't really what it is he said but you had a whole book of the Divine Promises of God that you can give to the Bride of Jesus Christ oh what we have to offer is greater than what the world has to offer what we have to give is greater than what the devil has to give I thank God that he's got gifts in here to be able to give to the church he said there's gifts in there for her he will not hold any of them back he'll give every one of them freely a true servant of God a modal servant a servant that God can put his trust in he won't try to hide it from cuz he knows that she's the oncoming queen of glory and he'll find every promise that lays in the Bible and he'll give it to the Bride of Jesus Christ I thank God that he's anointed Us in this hour to hear the message of the hour let me tell you why we don't hide from it because it's God's promise to the Bride of Jesus Christ and you got a right to give it to the people of God I don't care what they say about me if it's God's promise you got a right to it I don't care what they call us they can call us Fanatics if they want to but you got a right to the promises of God and I got a right to give it he said every true model servant of God that God can put his trust in he won't hide it he'll give it to her that's what the Bible said for there ain't no good thing that was withheld from them that'll walk upright before him God won't withhold one thing from you a't that something men men as music players want to come men try to put them curses on you God ain't going to bless you now God ain't going to all this is going to happen to you all the men do that ain't what God does let me tell you what a servant of God does he says I got a whole book of promises and a true let me can I read this a true servant a model servant a servant that God can put his trust in he will give every one of them freely he's got gifts for her he will not hold any of them back he won't try to hide it back from her because he knows she's the oncoming Queen we ain't got nothing to hold back there ain't no sense in being halfway there ain't no sense in being a halfway Church you may as well go all the way take every promise that God gave you whatever things you desire in your heart he said you believe it and you'll receive it let us get to a place that we can receive the promises of God he said if you abide in me and my word abides in you you ask what you will and it'll be given unto you get to a place that you can receive every promise of God the Bible's full of them brother Markin I love it hear a prophet of God he said and every promise in that book is yours because you are the bride my can you imagine what Rebecca thought that day when she sat up there with elaser she heard the call she responded she went to water in the camels and then he told her to come with her she left all that stuff she went up there on that Wagon Train well why don't we got so much stuff here I mean are we going to be a while there's all kinds of stuff there's gifts beautiful things I couldn't imagine all the wealth of Abraham the golds and the silvers and all the things that was sent to find a bride for his son that promised seed you know he'd been saving up for it for a long time you know they built up those Dows back there I think he saved up up for a while I'm going to use this whenever whenever he comes of age watched him as a little boy what look we found all this these trinkets here M they they must be Mighty valuable put them up one day he's going to be grown we got a purpose for them just set them up there a little while let them build up they just built and built and built wagon train filled up brother Mark pile the safes full I imagine it had so many things in it that had to have guards and servants to keep an eye on it so nobody would get into it and he guarded it until the time they would walk across the desert they' go into that place and they went with it make sure nobody else got in there and tampered with it when it came to the bride elaser just opened up the took the took the tarps off of it said everything in there is yours what do you mean it's mine I I didn't can you imagine don't you feel that way Chloe don't you feel that way but I didn't I didn't do nothing I didn't do nothing to to deserve that no it's yours but no I I just watered the camels I no that's all yours yeah but but I'm just I just rais I'm just a girl you see that next wagon that's all yours too can you imagine the feeling this the way I feel when I get to thinking of all the things that God has given to the church that's why it makes me so upset when you see the devil try to rob it from people Rob them of their blessing and the the joy that he's given them do you realize there's such joy that comes with salvation you come out of the church and praising God there's such Liberty brother Mark to serve the Lord and it just boy I just want to kick the devil when he he'll get somebody outside and after a few weeks just drag them down and try to pull their pass you know what'll happen some old friends will call them up and man where you been Buddy where you been I hadn't seen you in a while would you come by the house hang out with me let's play a video game like old times and one thing leads to another what is it trying to draw you back into that old world let me tell you something about Rebecca she wasn't going back there she heard heard a call oh friends let me tell you sometimes it may you may feel a little bit weak you the devil may be pulling at you but let me tell you as a servant of God that you don't have to go back you were chosen by God to go forward the sins of your past your present your future covered by the Covenant of God won't you stand to your feet he said while we're here listen God promised to supply all of our needs everything we had need of in this journey how many believes that he said but remember he only supplies it on his conditions we've got to meet his condition first we don't meet his condition he won't meet our condition you say brother Matt well what is God's condition for us to receive this promise of God this unconditional Covenant he said this is the only condition God has he it's the place that you meet him he'll not meet with you just because you're a church goer he won't meet with you because you're a a Baptist or a presbyterian or you're a Catholic or or or Pentecostal there's only one place that God can meet us and have fellowship with us otherwise he won't meet you just because you're because you go to a certain church but he'll meet you under one condition and that's under the shed blood when your sins have been confessed and expelled in his presence then by the blood the blood is always before him and he can only see you through that shed blood and you're white as snow when you've confessed your sins brother Mark once you've met that condition you tap into an unconditional Covenant you met him under the shed blood and Brother David there ain't one promise of God that he'll withhold from you all that you have need of is supplied amen won't you bow your heads this morning maybe you need something from the Lord you say Lord I I needed to hear that message this
