[34:28] There's no mountain to
[34:33] There's no fear that I have. He doesn't
[34:36] already know. There's no problem to be.
[34:40] There's no weapon.

[34:45] impossible.

[34:50] matter what's standing in your way
[34:51] tonight. There's no fear that I have. He
[34:55] doesn't already know. No problem to be.
[35:00] No weapon too strong. There's nothing
[35:03] for God that's impossible.
[35:07] Well, I won't be
[35:11] shaking. Well, I won't be moved.
[35:17] My God is
[35:18] [Music]
[35:20] faithful. His promise is true.
[35:25] So, I speak to the
[35:29] mountain. Yes, it's time to move.
[35:35] I know my God is bigger, better,
[35:40] stronger, greater than you.
[35:45] How many can you say that tonight? Our
[35:47] God is a faithful God. His promise is
[35:50] true. But don't matter what we're facing
[35:52] tonight, we've got a right to speak the
[35:54] word of God over it. Amen. You believe
[35:56] that tonight? Somebody turn around to
[35:58] somebody and say, "Amen." Say, "God is
[36:00] faithful and his promise is true."
[36:02] Somebody tell somebody, "God is
[36:04] faithful." Amen. If you ain't told
[36:06] nobody today, here's your opportunity.
[36:07] God is faithful. You pass by a lot of
[36:09] people on the way to church. I bet you
[36:11] didn't tell nobody. But now we got a
[36:13] chance. Turn around, say, "Somebody, God
[36:15] is faithful and his promise is true."
[36:17] How many believes that tonight? I just
[36:19] happen to be a believer. I say, "Our God
[36:21] is faithful. His promise is true." His
[36:23] word still stands. Amen. It don't matter
[36:26] what we have standing in our way
[36:27] tonight, we have a right to speak to it.
[36:29] Amen. Do you love the Lord tonight?
[36:31] Amen. I want you to give the Lord a hand
[36:33] clap of
[36:35] praise. Amen. We just want to remember
[36:38] brother JD is asking for prayer with his
[36:41] back. Ask the Lord to touch his body and
[36:44] if you have a need on your heart
[36:45] tonight, just lift your hand to the
[36:47] Lord. I know God knows all that we have
[36:49] need of. And and just trust that the
[36:51] Lord would come tonight and and be able
[36:53] to speak to our hearts and maybe you
[36:55] just let each one pray in their own way.
[36:58] Maybe pray for the people that's sitting
[36:59] near you. Somebody that you just have on
[37:02] your heart. Just call their name out to
[37:04] the Lord. Ask the Lord to come and move
[37:05] in a special way. Let's pray together.
[37:07] Gracious heavenly father, Lord, I say
[37:10] it's privileging, Lord, to be able to
[37:12] stand here tonight, Lord. God, to be
[37:15] able to serve you and call ourselves
[37:17] sons and daughters of God. Lord, I just
[37:21] thank you, Lord, for another
[37:22] opportunity, Lord, another day, Lord,
[37:24] that we can worship you, Lord.
[37:26] God, you gave us breath in our lungs.
[37:29] Lord, you allowed us to come tonight and
[37:31] gave us strength in our body to be able
[37:33] to lift our hands and our voices. And
[37:36] Lord, we just thank you for the
[37:38] privilege to serve you. And Lord, what a
[37:40] mighty God that you are. Lord, how good
[37:42] that you've been to us, Lord. We
[37:44] couldn't even express it, Lord. How
[37:46] great that you are. Lord, how we love
[37:48] you so. Lord, we just ask you tonight,
[37:51] Lord, that you would speak to every
[37:52] heart. Lord, I pray that you would meet
[37:54] every need, God. that we could go from
[37:56] this place knowing that we've been in
[37:57] your presence, Lord. And we'll be
[37:59] careful to give you the glory for all
[38:01] that's done. In Jesus name we pray.
[38:05] Amen. Amen. Praise the Lord. We just
[38:08] want to invite you to the scripture to
[38:09] the book of Second Thessalonians. And
[38:11] we'll read out of the second chapter and
[38:13] the first verse. We'll read down to
[38:16] about the fourth verse. Amen. Whoever
[38:18] that kid is, move him right to the
[38:19] front. Praise the Lord. Some little boy
[38:21] back there saying, "Hallelujah. You sit
[38:24] up right here by me. I I'll never forget
[38:26] I was over in India one time and it was
[38:27] so it was so crowded in that little
[38:29] building and they could pack three or 4
[38:31] hundred people in a just a just a little
[38:34] bitty area, you know, and and I got to
[38:36] preaching and we were, you know, these
[38:38] little kids was on the front row and
[38:40] they just worshiping the Lord and and
[38:42] they wear you out over there as a couple
[38:43] hours into that into that service and
[38:46] but probably a couple hours into the
[38:47] sermon honestly, but it's only because
[38:49] it's double time because they uh they
[38:51] they interpret, you know, and but in the
[38:54] middle of that I was just to preaching
[38:55] along and and I I started to move to the
[38:57] right and and there was a little girl
[38:59] laying right there on the pull pit just
[39:01] sound asleep. I thought man there she
[39:03] started she was hallelujah for a little
[39:05] while but after a while she done more
[39:06] smooth out and well she just laid up
[39:08] there and I just stepped over and kept
[39:10] on preaching but ain't nothing wrong
[39:12] with some kids getting free in the house
[39:13] of God. So I just I just love the
[39:16] presence of the Lord. Maybe she felt the
[39:18] presence of the Lord so good she just
[39:19] fell right asleep. Amen. So that's okay
[39:21] too. But we just love the Lord tonight.
[39:23] Amen. and you love the Lord. Amen. I got
[39:26] something on my heart and I told Sunday
[39:28] that we would be speaking on this
[39:29] subject and uh so we just there's a lot
[39:32] in here and it's a lot. So, uh we just
[39:35] want to try to make it where everybody
[39:37] can see what we want to show. But in 2
[39:39] Thessalonians the 2 chapter first verse,
[39:42] Paul said, "Now we beseech you,
[39:43] brethren, by the coming of our Lord
[39:45] Jesus Christ, and by our gathering
[39:46] together unto him, that you be not soon
[39:49] shaken in mind or be troubled, neither
[39:51] by spirit, nor by word, nor by letter,
[39:53] as from us, as that day of Christ is at
[39:56] hand." In other words, they were they
[39:58] were uh going through a time where
[40:00] people were wondering, was it too late?
[40:02] Had they missed him? Is everything gone
[40:04] past? Is the Lord coming? And so Paul is
[40:06] given some instruction to the church and
[40:08] he says, "Let no man deceive you by any
[40:10] means. For that day shall not come
[40:13] except there come a falling away first
[40:15] and that the man of sin be revealed and
[40:17] the son of predition who opposeth and
[40:20] exalteth himself above all that is
[40:22] called God or that is worshiped so that
[40:25] he as God siteth in the temple of God,
[40:28] showing himself that he is God." And I
[40:31] would like to take this subject tonight.
[40:33] Be not soon shaken as you take your
[40:35] seats. Be not soon shaken. Over the last
[40:38] few uh weeks, we've had uh some events
[40:41] that have taken place that have shaken
[40:43] the world. It's not uh it's it's been
[40:45] one great moments in history, especially
[40:48] in the United States. as you read. It
[40:50] doesn't matter where you read in the
[40:51] news, whether it be in the US or uh out
[40:54] of Europe and Italy and any uh even in
[40:58] India, Australia, no matter where you
[41:00] read, there's there's uh news that has
[41:02] taken the world by shock. Um and if you
[41:06] haven't been around or involved in it,
[41:08] you know, may not be something that too
[41:10] many thought was a great big deal. U but
[41:13] to the world that was watching it, it
[41:15] certainly has been that case. and uh in
[41:18] the election of a new pope. And so we we
[41:20] got to watch that here a few days ago,
[41:22] how uh that there was a new pope that
[41:24] was put into office. And of course, it's
[41:26] kind of been the uh the talk of all the
[41:28] religious communities over the past few
[41:30] weeks. And um and and the reason it's
[41:33] been that way is because it was actually
[41:36] uh prior to the pope being elected, just
[41:38] within a few days, even before the pope
[41:40] was elected, uh the news articles were
[41:42] quite different. They would say things
[41:43] like this that there's a 1% chance, a
[41:46] less than 1% chance that there would
[41:47] ever be a pope that would come out of
[41:49] the United States of America. I actually
[41:51] ran one article that said this. It said
[41:53] some that would believe that it is more
[41:55] likely one day to have a female pope
[41:58] than to ever have a pope come out of the
[41:59] United States. Well, you know what that
[42:01] means to uh the Catholic Church. There
[42:03] would never be a woman that would be in
[42:04] an office as a priest or an office as a
[42:06] pope. and and and actually even some
[42:09] Catholics believe that it would be more
[42:11] likely that one day the pope or the the
[42:13] church would transition to having a a
[42:15] woman as a pope than they ever would to
[42:17] have a pope come out of the United
[42:19] States. And so it was considered to be
[42:21] something that was impossible. It would
[42:23] uh matter of fact the reason was you can
[42:26] read this out of the New York Times. It
[42:28] says the United States was considered
[42:29] too powerful in the world to also put a
[42:31] man on the throne of St. Peter at the
[42:34] conclaves that elected Benedict the 16th
[42:36] and Pope Francis. Handicappers put a few
[42:39] Americans on the list of possible popes,
[42:41] but usually only with the caveat that
[42:44] they were long shots. In other words, it
[42:45] was just to appease the uh the priests
[42:47] and things in the United States, but
[42:49] never did they ever foresee that this is
[42:51] actually something that would take
[42:52] place. A matter of fact, this is the
[42:54] headline of the New York Times just a
[42:56] few days ago after the pope had got into
[42:58] office. The New York Times writes this,
[43:01] "An American pope as a question mark."
[43:03] An American pope, maybe it wasn't so
[43:05] impossible after all. So here, so you
[43:08] can see by the the term or the uh the
[43:10] language of the world uh that this was
[43:12] something that seemed to be a complete
[43:14] impossibility. And you know, I noticed
[43:16] on ABC News, there was actually, you
[43:18] know, there was a prophecy that actually
[43:20] uh went forth uh concerning the pope.
[43:23] and they actually had it on ABC News and
[43:25] and uh the uh the brother of of Pope
[43:27] Leo, his name was Lewis, brother his
[43:29] brother said that when he was just a
[43:31] six-year-old boy that their neighbor
[43:33] actually prophesied over him and said,
[43:36] "You will be the first American pope."
[43:38] He said, "I don't know where she got it
[43:39] or how she knew that." Uh but I know
[43:41] that she spoke that over his life. And
[43:42] you know, when I watched that on ABC
[43:44] News, you know, it just kind of c it's
[43:47] such an odd thing to think, brother
[43:48] Wesley, that here a man is elected as a
[43:51] pope. And on the news, they have an
[43:53] after-the-act hearsay prophecy from a
[43:55] man that that only after he was elected
[43:57] pope did they say anything about it. And
[43:59] then it was hearsay at that from some
[44:01] neighbor or some neighbor lady, but it
[44:03] was such a big thing that it was on ABC
[44:06] News that there was a prophecy
[44:07] concerning. And I thought, you know,
[44:09] isn't it something that you can go
[44:10] through all that and have an after
[44:11] the-act hearsay and that's a prophecy?
[44:13] But let me tell you what wasn't in the
[44:14] news. It was what what the prophet of
[44:16] God spoke in 1954 on on December the
[44:20] 19th. He said, "I believe one of these
[44:21] glorious days when this United
[44:23] Confederation of Church goes together."
[44:25] And the new pope is brought out of the
[44:26] United States and put over there
[44:28] according to prophecy, they'll form an
[44:30] image like unto the beast. And I tell
[44:32] you, the true church of God will be
[44:34] drove together. the real true believers
[44:36] out of Methodist and Baptist and
[44:38] Presbyterian, Pentecostal, Nazarene,
[44:40] Pilgrim Holiness, whatever they'll be,
[44:42] they will go together and cemented by
[44:44] the love of God that'll make up the body
[44:46] of our Lord Jesus Christ. All of the
[44:49] believers here, this brother Mark here,
[44:52] this is a pro a word that was spoken. I
[44:55] don't think brother Bram wasn't getting
[44:56] up there trying to make something of
[44:58] himself or trying to uh get any kind of
[45:00] recognition. He said, "But according to
[45:02] prophecy, there will be a pope coming
[45:04] out of the United States." I I thought
[45:06] here was a strange thing that that after
[45:08] that this statement was made, when
[45:10] brother made this statement, 1954,
[45:12] December the 19th, do you realize that
[45:14] nine months later, almost to the day,
[45:16] the very first first American pope was
[45:19] born, Pope Leo. He was born on September
[45:21] the 14th, 1955. Almost nine months to
[45:24] the very day that this word was spoken.
[45:26] And you know, I I thought it to be kind
[45:28] of a strange thing. I don't maybe
[45:30] there's no spiritual significance to it
[45:31] at all, but I know the man wasn't even
[45:33] thought of. But when a prophet of God
[45:35] said, "I know that there is coming one
[45:37] out of the United States," I thought it
[45:38] was quite an odd uh coincidence that it
[45:41] just so happened that uh that nine
[45:43] months later this man is born in the
[45:45] United States in Chicago. And I I I I
[45:47] thought, you know, maybe it's no
[45:49] spiritual significance of his natural
[45:51] birth or his natural seed. But let me
[45:52] tell you this, there was a spiritual
[45:54] seed that was certainly planted that
[45:56] day. And it was planted in the minds of
[45:58] the believers when a prophet of God said
[46:00] that he believed that one day there
[46:01] would be an American pope. And even
[46:03] though the world didn't think there
[46:04] would be and when the they thought it
[46:06] would be impossible and they thought it
[46:08] was less than 1% but because that word
[46:10] seeds planted in a believer's heart,
[46:12] they said, "One of these days there'll
[46:13] be a pope that's going to come out of
[46:15] America. Y'all may call us foolish and
[46:17] you may make fun of me and you may call
[46:19] me all these things, but one of these
[46:20] days there shall be." You know, the
[46:22] world they say it's impossible. They
[46:23] said it wasn't likely, but we always
[46:26] believe that that was going to happen
[46:27] because a prophet of God said it's going
[46:29] to happen according to prophecy. You
[46:31] know, I think that many would use this
[46:33] today and they would use this very uh
[46:35] word as a as a purpose or or a reason to
[46:38] vindicate a person or draw attention to
[46:41] uh to the prophet of God. But I'm going
[46:43] to use it for what he intended it for.
[46:44] It wasn't the purpose of it wasn't to
[46:46] draw attention to himself. The purpose
[46:48] of him making that statement was not to
[46:50] cause us to be followers after a man,
[46:53] but the purpose of it is that our eyes
[46:55] and the age that we're living in, that
[46:57] our spiritual eye would be open to the
[46:59] times in the in the season that we're
[47:01] living. And so, so here he noticed that
[47:03] he's showing that the prophecies that
[47:05] were in the b the Bible were going to
[47:07] come to pass. This is why the prophet
[47:09] would bring this up that here the what's
[47:11] in the Bible, it's going to come to pass
[47:13] in this last stage. And so here as we
[47:15] read this statement, I found so much
[47:16] power in this statement because when he
[47:18] would say that as this world would come
[47:20] together, this council would come
[47:21] together, he was referring to the world
[47:24] council of churches, which if you ever
[47:25] studied on it, uh which you know many
[47:28] years it was talked about, but in 1948
[47:30] they had their first formal assembly of
[47:32] the world council of churches and it was
[47:34] joined by many churches. It was a great
[47:36] unified group. The purpose of it is to
[47:38] take down all the barriers of
[47:39] denominations and bring all of the
[47:41] churches together because they had
[47:42] gotten separated by different beliefs
[47:44] and dogmas and creeds and and so they
[47:46] they wanted to make a unified body. But
[47:48] you'll if you study the history, you'll
[47:50] find out that the one of the major
[47:52] churches that wasn't a part of the world
[47:53] council was the Catholic Church. They
[47:55] wouldn't be a part of it. They wouldn't
[47:57] join it. But they and the reason is
[47:59] because they believe that their stand uh
[48:01] w was that the reformation Christians uh
[48:04] didn't recognize the pope as being an
[48:06] authority. And so because these reformed
[48:08] Christians wouldn't recognize the pope
[48:10] as an authority, then they wouldn't be
[48:11] worthy of joining. They don't accept our
[48:13] authority. So so why would we join them?
[48:15] But I just want to lay this in here. But
[48:17] they actually weren't far from the very
[48:20] thinking of the World Council of
[48:21] Churches, which is what brother Brandon
[48:23] was uh speaking about many times through
[48:25] uh uh through the last uh several years
[48:27] of his ministry. But but but you'll
[48:29] notice that even after that that they
[48:31] even though they didn't join the
[48:32] council, but but they actually sent
[48:34] delegates to the council. Even today,
[48:36] they have delegates that represents the
[48:38] Catholic Church. And every time there's
[48:39] a WCC conference, the delegates of the
[48:41] Roman Catholic Church are present or
[48:43] represented in the conference. And but
[48:45] but you'll notice that even when this
[48:47] council was going on, they they were
[48:49] still preaching on unity. There was
[48:51] still it was a talk of bringing
[48:52] something together. And I'm building all
[48:54] this up for a purpose. But but in 1964,
[48:57] we we actually see this when they had
[48:59] their own council, the Roman Catholic
[49:01] Church. And this was the time uh when
[49:03] Pope Paul V 6 was in office as a pope.
[49:05] And he actually wrote a letter or or or
[49:08] a document that was actually passed by
[49:09] their uh by the the Vatican council. It
[49:12] was called the uh Unitatis redressio
[49:15] which in other words it was the
[49:16] restoration of unity and it got its name
[49:18] it it passed in the in the assembly in
[49:21] the council but it got its name from the
[49:23] the title actually came from the first
[49:25] line of the document. If you ever read
[49:26] it it would read this way. It says the
[49:28] restoration of unity among all
[49:30] Christians is one of the principal
[49:32] concerns of the second Vatican council.
[49:34] So here we are in 1964 while the world
[49:37] council of churches is building up and
[49:39] they're bringing uh the the these
[49:41] denominational churches together but
[49:43] then then the Catholic Church is saying
[49:45] the restoration of unity I want you to
[49:46] hear this is among all Christians is one
[49:49] of the principal concerns of the second
[49:51] Vatican council now here when they make
[49:53] this statement in other words our
[49:55] concern is the church would come back
[49:57] together the unity of all the Christians
[49:59] in other words there's these great
[50:00] religions that are raising up great
[50:01] Muslim religions and these great uh
[50:04] heathen religion. So all the Christians
[50:06] need to come together so we can combat
[50:07] this uh that whatever we face. But I
[50:10] want you to notice that whenever they
[50:11] would make this statement or this
[50:13] document in in uh 1964 that this is not
[50:17] the first time that the Roman Catholic
[50:19] Church had spoke of unity among the
[50:21] faith or among the believers. So this
[50:23] unitatus was actually in 1964 but it was
[50:27] similar to another call which happened
[50:30] back in 1894. Now I'm calling this to
[50:33] your attention for a purpose because the
[50:34] unatitus called for a reunion of all
[50:37] Christianom. In other words, everybody
[50:39] come together and in and you know it was
[50:42] uh uh and come together and and kind of
[50:44] fellowship have a fellowship together.
[50:46] But but the difference was that in this
[50:48] previous call which was in 1894 it was
[50:51] the last Pope Leo that there ever was.
[50:54] This was in in in the 13th Pope Leo and
[50:56] he actually wrote a letter called the
[50:58] preclara. And I know some of you that
[51:00] have studied religious history, I've
[51:02] read that uh uh before even in school
[51:05] that they actually talked about it. And
[51:06] and in this preclara, the difference
[51:08] between unatus and preclara is unatus in
[51:12] 1964 was saying that the church should
[51:14] come together and we could we could lay
[51:16] aside our beliefs and we could just kind
[51:19] of come together and find some form of
[51:21] fellowship and not be able to put our
[51:23] beliefs on one another. But the
[51:25] difference was is Pope Leo I 13th in
[51:28] 1894 the preclara it focuses on the
[51:31] unity of people of God and not to be
[51:33] separated but even in the very word of
[51:36] prayer it was a call to return to the
[51:39] fold under the unity of the viker of
[51:42] Christ in other words when Pope Leo
[51:44] called for a unity it wasn't to lay
[51:46] aside our beliefs he said we can have
[51:48] unity only under one head we want the
[51:51] churches to come together and we want
[51:53] the people to fellowship together. But
[51:55] the only way we will make that happen is
[51:57] if you recognize the headship of the
[51:59] pope as being the authority of all
[52:01] religion upon the earth. So this is the
[52:03] difference between Pope Leo's unity and
[52:06] the unatus unity in 1964. And so even in
[52:10] Pope Leo's letter in in in 1894, it's
[52:13] been criticized through the years
[52:14] through through Protestant churches. But
[52:16] in the letter, he writes this very
[52:18] words. He said, "We hold upon this earth
[52:21] as the Catholic Church. We hold upon
[52:23] this earth the place of God Almighty. In
[52:25] other words, if you want to find God,
[52:27] you got to come to me to get it. If you
[52:29] want to find the where the seat of God,
[52:31] the throne of God or access to God,
[52:33] you'll have to come to me to get it. You
[52:35] now and now reason I say this is
[52:36] important is because here recently we
[52:38] had a new pope that was elected into
[52:40] office. And here they went into the
[52:41] conclave and they passed forth their
[52:43] votes and you know how they come
[52:44] together and if they don't get a pope
[52:46] the next day they vote two times and
[52:48] that night they vote two more times the
[52:50] next morning two more times until
[52:51] twothirds of them can agree on one pope.
[52:54] The only people are voting is the people
[52:56] that are eligible to be a pope. They're
[52:57] all in a room locked in sequestered and
[52:59] make and voting to find somebody that
[53:01] can take this office. And and so the the
[53:04] important thing is that after a pope is
[53:06] elected, they all sit in anticipation
[53:09] for this great moment. What they're
[53:10] waiting for, brother Brian, is they're
[53:13] waiting to find out what this pope wants
[53:15] to be called. See, his name that was
[53:18] given by his birth mother. It won't be
[53:20] his name in the office of the pope. But
[53:22] every pope has their own right to choose
[53:24] their pope name. In other words, what
[53:26] I'll be and what and how I will be
[53:29] remembered. And and the reason it's
[53:30] important is because the name that they
[53:33] choose to it shows the world the
[53:36] direction that they want to go. So if
[53:38] they want to be a pope that that that
[53:40] was real given to the poor, then they
[53:42] pick a name of a pope that was given to
[53:44] the poor and he was a real he was real
[53:46] servant and I I I'm that kind of a hard
[53:48] and you know I want to be a servant too.
[53:50] And so they'll use that same pope's name
[53:52] and that's the name they'll use. But but
[53:53] notice when this pope was elected pope,
[53:56] he just happened to choose the name Pope
[53:58] Leo. The last time there was a Pope Leo,
[54:01] it was a call for unity under one head
[54:04] under the Pope under the Viker of
[54:06] Christ. I thought here it shows his
[54:07] nature. It tells you his directions. It
[54:10] tells you his beliefs. So friends, I
[54:11] I'll just say it like this tonight. I'm
[54:13] not going to hold nothing back, but
[54:14] don't be shocked whenever he writes his
[54:16] own letter of unity that includes the
[54:19] same language as Pope Leo I 13th wrote
[54:22] in 1894. You you don't have to be
[54:24] shocked. But let me tell you what he's
[54:25] going to find out whenever they go to
[54:27] writing these letters and calling for
[54:28] unity and calling uh for people to come
[54:31] uh uh under under this head, you know,
[54:34] but they'll find the same problems that
[54:36] they had in 1894. They still exist
[54:38] today. Let me tell you what they were.
[54:40] I'll just read it right out of their own
[54:41] book. They said the problems were in
[54:43] their letters of unity is that there are
[54:45] still some communities in the world that
[54:48] have insoluble doctrinal differences
[54:50] with Catholic Christianity. And because
[54:53] of these people's theology of the holy
[54:55] trinity is not compatible with the
[54:57] doctrine that was spoke at the council
[54:59] of Nika. So therefore, we can't have
[55:02] unity in the whole world cuz there's
[55:04] these communities out there that won't
[55:06] accept the doctrine of the trinity that
[55:08] happened in the council of Nika in 3:25
[55:11] AD. I said, I'd like to call them
[55:13] beforehand and just let them know. You
[55:15] go ahead and write the letters that you
[55:17] want to write and you go ahead and you
[55:19] make a call for unity and you go ahead
[55:21] and make the stand that you want to
[55:22] stand. But I say unto you tonight that
[55:24] there still are communities around this
[55:27] world that will not bow down to a pope.
[55:29] They they won't come under the headship
[55:31] of some man. I say there's still
[55:33] communities. People's been a wrong
[55:35] They've been wrong about this all along.
[55:37] They they've been wrong about the whole
[55:39] thing. Even in the I may as well just
[55:41] lay it out, but even in the past few
[55:42] months or the past few years leading
[55:44] into this, you'll notice that
[55:46] everything's been about Russia and about
[55:48] communism again because there's a a war
[55:50] in Ukraine and they're threatening a
[55:51] third world war and all this communism
[55:54] is rising in the east. But here a
[55:56] prophet of God would say 1962. He said
[55:58] they say communism is going to take over
[56:00] the world. He said but don't you believe
[56:02] that communism ain't ever going to do
[56:04] nothing. He said it's Romanism that's
[56:07] going to rule according to the Bible. It
[56:10] has to before the coming of the Lord.
[56:12] This is what Paul was talking about.
[56:14] Second Thessalonians. And brothers have
[56:16] it up there. Paul said, "Let no man
[56:18] deceive you by any means, for that day
[56:20] shall not come except there be a falling
[56:22] away first and the man of sin be
[56:24] revealed. the son of predition who
[56:26] opposeth and exaltth himself above all
[56:28] that is called God or that is worshiped
[56:30] so that he as God siteth in the temple
[56:33] of God showing himself that he is God.
[56:36] So here Paul is telling the Thessalonian
[56:38] church don't worry about the coming of
[56:40] the Lord until you see this thing come
[56:42] to pass. There will be a great falling
[56:45] away and then the man of sin will be
[56:47] revealed. He'll exalt himself above all
[56:49] that is called God. He'll be as a God.
[56:51] He'll show himself to be God. Friends,
[56:53] it ain't communism. It's Romanism. You,
[56:56] this is the prophecy that Paul was
[56:58] laying to the Thessalonians. And he
[57:00] said, listen, what God is going to do,
[57:02] he said, he will send them a strong
[57:03] delusion and they will believe the
[57:05] delusion and be damned by the very lie.
[57:08] You say, well, what is the delusion?
[57:09] It's the delusion of Christianity. It's
[57:11] a delusion of worship. It's a delusion
[57:14] of God or things that are called God.
[57:16] They're under this great this great
[57:18] delusion. But but but Paul said there'd
[57:20] be them that believe not the truth. But
[57:22] let me tell you what that was. It was
[57:23] only to the unbelievers. But what about
[57:26] the believers? Let me tell you what Paul
[57:27] said. He said, "But in that time when
[57:30] they believe this lie, in that time when
[57:32] they believe a strong delusion, in that
[57:34] time that damnation comes to them," he
[57:37] said, "But God has from the beginning
[57:40] chosen you to salvation through
[57:43] sanctification of the spirit and belief
[57:45] of the truth." You know what that tells
[57:47] me, brother Mark? that God has reserved
[57:49] somebody to believe the truth of his
[57:51] word. I thank God that sometimes we look
[57:54] around and the only thing we see is
[57:56] unbelief. When we look around that
[57:58] people's worshiping idols, people are
[58:00] wor the heathens, they worship after
[58:01] men. They're worshiping after churches.
[58:03] It reminds me of the prophet Elijah when
[58:05] he fled from the from from the presence
[58:07] of Ahab and he called out to God. He
[58:09] said, "The children of Israel have
[58:11] forsaken thy covenant. They've thrown
[58:13] down thy altars. They've slain the
[58:14] prophets with a sword." He said, "And I
[58:16] am only left and they looked to take my
[58:19] life." But I remember what God said. He
[58:21] called the prophet when he was laying
[58:22] under that juniper tree. And he felt
[58:24] like the whole world was coming down on
[58:26] him. God said, "Elijah, I want you to
[58:29] look. There's 7,000 over there that has
[58:32] never bowed a knee to bail." It's a call
[58:35] that God has reserved somebody to
[58:37] believe the truth. I I thank God that
[58:40] I'm a part of a chosen few people of God
[58:43] that'll stand on the truth of God's
[58:44] word. There may be unbelievers, but
[58:47] there's believers that have been
[58:48] reserved to the truth. There may be
[58:50] doubters, but there's believers that's
[58:52] reserved for the truth. There may be
[58:54] skeptics, but there's believers that
[58:56] have been reserved to the truth. We've
[58:59] been reserved to believe. They've always
[59:01] been unbelievers and skeptics and
[59:03] doubters. That's what they were all in
[59:05] the Old Testament with the Hebrew
[59:06] children. They wouldn't bow down to that
[59:09] great image. If you don't bow down,
[59:11] we're going to throw you in a fiery
[59:12] furnace, they said. But you know what?
[59:14] They wouldn't bow down. The devil
[59:16] couldn't get them to bow. Brother Mark,
[59:17] he couldn't get them to bend. And after
[59:19] a few days, he found out he couldn't get
[59:21] them to burn either because there was
[59:22] something on the inside of them that God
[59:25] had called him to that age to be able to
[59:27] stand. Oh friends, let me tell you,
[59:29] there's some believers in here tonight
[59:31] that you couldn't burn their experience
[59:32] out of them either cuz we've been purged
[59:34] by the Holy Ghost. Every doubt, every
[59:37] every spirit of skepticism, it's been
[59:39] purged out of my life by the spirit of
[59:41] God. I'm on fire. All right. Hallelujah.
[59:45] With the truth of the word of God. We've
[59:47] been reserved for truth. Amen. Listen
[59:50] what he said. We hold upon this pl this
[59:53] earth the place of God Almighty. Pope
[59:54] Leo, the last one. We hold upon this
[59:57] earth the place of God Almighty. Isn't
[59:59] that what Paul is speaking of? Think
[1:00:00] about he said that is worshiped so that
[1:00:02] he as God siteth in the temple of God
[1:00:05] showing himself that he is God. You see,
[1:00:08] in other words, they built this great
[1:00:10] throne that has been built up. And it is
[1:00:12] said by the church to be the seat of
[1:00:14] God. In other words, it's God's throne.
[1:00:16] But the reality is it's not God's seat
[1:00:18] at all. Do I got a minute? It's not
[1:00:20] God's seat at all. Can I show you where
[1:00:22] it is? Revelation 2 chapter, the Bible
[1:00:24] said, "And to the angel of the church of
[1:00:26] Pilgrim, write these things, sayeth he
[1:00:28] which hath a sharp sword with two edges.
[1:00:30] I know thy works and where thou dwellest
[1:00:32] even where Satan's seat is that thou
[1:00:35] holdest fast my name and hast not denied
[1:00:37] my faith even in those days wherein
[1:00:40] Antipas was my faithful martyr who was
[1:00:43] slain among you where Satan dwelleth. So
[1:00:46] if you want to see where this Satan seed
[1:00:48] is well it's real easy to find out just
[1:00:50] look up where Antipos was martyed
[1:00:52] because he said it was at the place
[1:00:54] where my Antipos my faithful martyr who
[1:00:56] was slain among you where Satan
[1:00:58] dwelleth. So you you actually look up
[1:01:00] the history of Antipos, you'll find this
[1:01:02] out that it was it was in Pergamin that
[1:01:04] he was martyed. And this man Antipos,
[1:01:06] you boy, it just makes you it oh boy,
[1:01:09] the the devil that he was killed because
[1:01:12] he casted out devils. He was he was
[1:01:14] killed because people worshiped demons
[1:01:17] and he would go to people and say, "If
[1:01:18] you want free of that, then I can lay
[1:01:20] hands on you and cast it out and God
[1:01:22] will free you from it." Other words, he
[1:01:23] found somebody that had an addiction to
[1:01:25] tobacco. He would cast out the demon. I
[1:01:27] I don't know what the demons were, but I
[1:01:28] know the people worship the demons. And
[1:01:30] here he was preaching, saying that God
[1:01:32] can deliver you of you and God can cast
[1:01:34] it out. And they killed him because he
[1:01:36] had the ability to cast out devils. I
[1:01:38] thought, my goodness, all he was was a
[1:01:39] good gospel preacher that that said if
[1:01:41] you're if you're bound by something,
[1:01:42] there's a way to get deliverance. If
[1:01:44] there there's something that's
[1:01:45] tormenting your spirit, there's a way to
[1:01:47] be free of it. And so and so here they
[1:01:49] murdered they murdered him. It was that
[1:01:51] great king Adalus that came and murdered
[1:01:54] and murdered Antipos. So you see this
[1:01:56] Adalas who who was the king of Babylon.
[1:01:58] I'm going I just want to go right
[1:02:00] through this scripture. Adalas at the
[1:02:02] time he was the king of Babylon. And
[1:02:04] here so we see the Bible use this word
[1:02:06] Babylon. Babylon the Greek Babylon. But
[1:02:08] Adalas was actually the king or the
[1:02:09] leader. And during the during the the
[1:02:12] Persian invasion they fled to to
[1:02:15] Pergamon. That's how they got
[1:02:16] transferred into this other region. But
[1:02:18] Adalus was still the leader. He was
[1:02:20] still the king the king priest many
[1:02:22] would call him. He he was the great man
[1:02:24] among them. So here it was in Pergamon
[1:02:26] that they actually they reestablished
[1:02:29] their kingdom. So what was in Babylon
[1:02:31] was reestablished in Pergamon. Same
[1:02:33] people. So they they went there. They
[1:02:35] reestablished their kingdom. And and and
[1:02:37] through the many years or the
[1:02:38] generations of Adalas, he his son would
[1:02:41] take over as king and then the next son
[1:02:43] would take over as king. And so we find
[1:02:45] that all the way down to Adalus III that
[1:02:48] after he died, he had no sons that could
[1:02:51] be the heir over the throne. And so
[1:02:53] Adalus III, he actually left in his
[1:02:56] written will that that all of Pergamon
[1:02:58] would be given unto Rome here. They were
[1:03:00] neighboring. They were they were over
[1:03:02] them. They they they they were a part of
[1:03:04] this this area. And so they willed the
[1:03:06] kingdom to Rome. So now what used to be
[1:03:08] Babylon that came and became Pergamon in
[1:03:11] the will it was given over to Rome and
[1:03:14] so Rome became the power over this
[1:03:17] Babylon. It it became the power over
[1:03:19] over the Pergamon area. And so so
[1:03:21] throughout the scripture you can see the
[1:03:23] the tie to Rome and Babylon. Ma matter
[1:03:26] of fact this is the this is the vision
[1:03:27] that John saw when he was on the aisle
[1:03:29] of Patmas. Remember when the emperor
[1:03:31] that that hated Christianity, he put he
[1:03:33] put John on the aisle of Patmas which
[1:03:35] was an exile for religious or political
[1:03:38] prisoners. So here he was put on this
[1:03:40] island, brother Wesley out by himself.
[1:03:42] This was 94 94 AD after after Jesus was
[1:03:45] gone almost a hundred years he was put
[1:03:47] out in this place. And so but but in
[1:03:50] this place that John was in this vision
[1:03:52] that he would have here in Revelation
[1:03:55] 17, he said, "He carried me away in the
[1:03:57] spirit into the wilderness. And I saw a
[1:03:59] woman sit upon a scarlet-c colored beast
[1:04:01] full of names of blasphemy, having seven
[1:04:04] heads and 10 horns. And the woman was
[1:04:06] arrayed in purple and scarlet color,
[1:04:08] decked with gold and precious stones and
[1:04:10] pearls, having a golden cup in her hand
[1:04:12] full of abominations and filthiness of
[1:04:14] her fornication. And upon her forehead
[1:04:16] was a name written, Mystery, Babylon the
[1:04:19] Great, the mother of harlots and
[1:04:20] abominations of the earth. And I saw the
[1:04:23] woman drunken with the blood of the
[1:04:24] saints, and with the blood of the
[1:04:25] martyrs of Jesus. And when I saw her, I
[1:04:28] wondered with great admiration. And the
[1:04:30] angel said to me, "Wherefore does thou
[1:04:32] marvel? For I will tell thee the mystery
[1:04:34] of the woman, and of the beast that
[1:04:36] carth her, which hath seven heads and t
[1:04:38] horns."
[1:04:41] So here as as the angel is speaking to
[1:04:43] John, he sees this image of this great
[1:04:46] woman that's sitting upon these this or
[1:04:50] on this great beast that has these seven
[1:04:52] heads. And now he says, "But I will tell
[1:04:54] thee a mystery." In other words, when an
[1:04:56] angel says, "I'm going to tell you the
[1:04:58] mystery." He says that In other words,
[1:05:00] I'm going to explain it in a way that
[1:05:02] you can understand it. Is that is that
[1:05:03] okay? In other in other words, if I'm
[1:05:05] going to tell you the mystery, I'm going
[1:05:06] to give you the revelation of it. I'm
[1:05:08] I'm going to lay it out here where you
[1:05:09] can see it right now. It's a mystery.
[1:05:11] You don't know why you saw this great
[1:05:12] image. Who is this great woman? This
[1:05:14] this great Babylon that was sitting upon
[1:05:17] this great beast that had seven heads.
[1:05:18] But the angel says, "But I'm going to
[1:05:20] make this plain to you. I'm going to I'm
[1:05:22] I'm going to tell you the mystery." Now,
[1:05:23] the next words that the angel speaks, I
[1:05:26] love this. The next words that the angel
[1:05:28] speaks, they had to be plain to John
[1:05:30] because it was the revealing of a
[1:05:32] mystery. So here you'll notice I I want
[1:05:34] to lay this in here that the book of
[1:05:36] revelation which was written in 94 AD
[1:05:39] when John was on the aisle of Patmas
[1:05:40] here it was after 70 AD 70 matter of
[1:05:43] fact there was several books in the New
[1:05:45] Testament that was after that time
[1:05:46] period. Uh uh Matthew was Luke was uh
[1:05:50] all John 1, second John, Jude,
[1:05:52] Revelation they were all written after
[1:05:54] 70 AD. So here we are in 94 AD and and
[1:05:57] John has a vision. And the angel of the
[1:05:59] Lord is speaking to him in this vision.
[1:06:01] And he says, "But I want to make plain
[1:06:03] the mystery." He says, "The beast that
[1:06:05] thou saw and is not that ascended out of
[1:06:08] the bottomless pit and go into predition
[1:06:11] that dwell upon the earth shall wonder.
[1:06:13] They that dwell upon the earth shall
[1:06:14] wonder whose names were not written in
[1:06:16] the book of life from the foundation of
[1:06:17] the world. They will behold when they
[1:06:19] behold the beast that was and is and not
[1:06:22] yet is." In other words, they would
[1:06:23] wonder at it. They would marvel at it.
[1:06:25] They would be drawn to it. He said, "But
[1:06:27] here is the mind which hath wisdom." In
[1:06:29] other words, here comes the revelation.
[1:06:31] The seven heads are seven mountains on
[1:06:34] which the woman siteth. Now, if for me
[1:06:35] and you to read that, you'd say, "Well,
[1:06:37] how is that make a how is that a
[1:06:40] revealing of a mystery?" It almost
[1:06:41] sounds like the angel answered a mystery
[1:06:43] with another mystery. He said, "The
[1:06:45] mystery revealed is the seven heads are
[1:06:47] seven mountains on which the woman
[1:06:49] siteth." But you'd have to know the time
[1:06:51] that John lived in here. a man that was
[1:06:54] that was accustomed to Rome and a and an
[1:06:56] outcast there and and no doubt been
[1:06:58] involved in in in buying and selling.
[1:07:00] And you'll notice that in 71 AD, the
[1:07:03] emperor uh Vespasia in 71 AD actually
[1:07:06] made a Roman coin. This is how much this
[1:07:09] mystery was made plain unto John. There
[1:07:11] actually was a Roman coin and on the
[1:07:13] back of the coin they had the goddess
[1:07:15] Roma. The goddess Roma, in other words,
[1:07:17] which represented Rome. It was a symbol
[1:07:19] of Rome. But notice what she's sitting
[1:07:21] on. Even when you read about Roman
[1:07:23] history, it was the goddess Roma that's
[1:07:25] sitting on the seven hills of Rome. So
[1:07:27] in 71 AD, this coin is prevalent in
[1:07:31] Rome. This is what they're they're
[1:07:32] packing around their nickels and
[1:07:33] quarters in their pocket. I I thought
[1:07:35] here John that no doubt bought and sold
[1:07:37] that, you know, he had to eat, he had to
[1:07:39] buy and sell things. But this was a
[1:07:40] Roman coin that it was so common known
[1:07:43] in Rome that this is what that this was
[1:07:46] uh that this was seven hills and this
[1:07:48] great power was sitting upon these seven
[1:07:50] hills that when the angel is revealing
[1:07:52] to John what this mystery is. Who is
[1:07:55] this great mystery woman that is sitting
[1:07:57] or riding on this seven-headed beast?
[1:07:59] The angel said, "Well, here's the
[1:08:00] mystery made plain. The seven heads are
[1:08:02] seven mountains which the woman sits
[1:08:04] on." So now John who a man that no doubt
[1:08:07] would would understand that language
[1:08:09] very clearly the I know the seven hills
[1:08:11] that the woman sits on it's Rome and
[1:08:14] it's the power it's that Roman power
[1:08:16] that great power that is sitting upon
[1:08:18] this land you you realize that that that
[1:08:20] it made it plain of what he was speaking
[1:08:22] of. In other words this seat of power
[1:08:24] the Bible speaking of this seat of power
[1:08:26] in Rome is not the seat that God sits on
[1:08:30] but it's the seat that Satan sits on. So
[1:08:32] here this is what John saw. This is
[1:08:34] what's been passed down through the ages
[1:08:36] that people have let go by and and
[1:08:39] wouldn't understand or wouldn't read.
[1:08:40] And now here they come and the in the in
[1:08:42] the very own pope in 1894 says, "This is
[1:08:45] the throne of God. This is the place of
[1:08:47] the sovereign God. This throne that I'm
[1:08:49] sitting on, the throne of St. Peter is
[1:08:51] the throne of God himself." But here
[1:08:54] that John would have a revelation. The
[1:08:55] angel said, "It ain't certainly the
[1:08:57] throne of God. It's the seat of Satan
[1:08:59] that he's sitting on." It ain't I I tell
[1:09:01] you what it the Satan seat is actually
[1:09:04] referring to the power that is within
[1:09:06] Rome. So it's not a throne of God. It's
[1:09:09] a throne of the devil. I'll just lay it
[1:09:10] out there. They they can hunt me down if
[1:09:12] they want to, but I'm just reading the
[1:09:13] Bible. It was the It was Satan's seat.
[1:09:15] You say, "Well, what what is that
[1:09:16] power?" It's the power of this Roman
[1:09:18] Empire. You think about what the power
[1:09:20] that they had even in the time of did I
[1:09:23] run out of time? Even in the time of
[1:09:25] Constantine, he was the great emperor of
[1:09:26] Rome, known to be one of the one of the
[1:09:28] the the great men. And really he was
[1:09:30] just a great politician but and he but
[1:09:32] and he had great great wars and and and
[1:09:34] but but here they had came together in
[1:09:37] the time of Constantine with the pagan
[1:09:39] priests and at that time they were
[1:09:41] called they they were called the
[1:09:42] nicicoatan. In other words they had
[1:09:44] their own religion. They were the priest
[1:09:46] over Rome and so Constantine came
[1:09:48] together with this nicicoatan to form a
[1:09:51] a a a place or a a unity with the church
[1:09:54] or this power of Rome. and and here all
[1:09:57] of this time they had been known by
[1:09:59] their military power and by the by the
[1:10:01] strength of the empire and all and and
[1:10:03] you know and the power that the empire
[1:10:04] had. But but now the niclatans brother
[1:10:07] said notice the nickelans they at one
[1:10:09] time in the church of Ephesus it was
[1:10:11] just deeds. They just held power over
[1:10:13] people and they just they ushered
[1:10:15] authority over people. But but now it
[1:10:17] actually became doctrine. In other
[1:10:19] words, in in the in the in the 300 AD in
[1:10:22] that 3rd century, it became the doctrine
[1:10:24] of the church that they established
[1:10:25] these great men and great great fellows
[1:10:27] and these high priests and they they
[1:10:28] established them over people. This
[1:10:30] wasn't something that God done in the
[1:10:32] book of Acts. This is something that the
[1:10:33] church done uh 300 years uh uh later.
[1:10:36] So, so you see it became the doctrine.
[1:10:39] They had high priests. They they didn't
[1:10:41] call them popes yet, but they were
[1:10:42] called archbishops, great fellows, men
[1:10:44] of renown. But their doctrine, it was
[1:10:46] formal. He said, "But what they were
[1:10:48] doing was getting away from the
[1:10:50] spiritfilled, Holy Ghostled church." So
[1:10:52] here they were trying to get away with
[1:10:54] all these heretics and they let them go
[1:10:55] off in the minority. They called them
[1:10:57] heretics because they wouldn't agree
[1:10:59] with them. And they had these great
[1:11:00] denominations. They were forming these
[1:11:02] great churches. They they formed these
[1:11:03] great cathedrals. They they went out and
[1:11:05] had great campaigns where people gave
[1:11:07] taxes and money to build these great
[1:11:09] these great uh golden buildings and
[1:11:11] places a place that was worthy of a
[1:11:14] temple of God. uh a place that was
[1:11:15] worthy for a deity to be able to sit
[1:11:18] upon a throne. And on the backs of
[1:11:20] people, they built these great things.
[1:11:22] They they established the these these
[1:11:23] great things, he said. But really, and
[1:11:25] then the people that would stand on the
[1:11:27] truth, they deemed them as heretics.
[1:11:29] They hunted them. They killed them. They
[1:11:31] murdered them just like they did in
[1:11:33] Israel in the days of Jesus. They they
[1:11:35] hunted them down. He said, "But the
[1:11:36] church, it didn't matter what happened.
[1:11:38] The church wanted to be free under the
[1:11:40] jurisdiction and the power of the Holy
[1:11:42] Spirit as Christ had promised them. He
[1:11:45] promised he'd be with them. He promised
[1:11:47] he'd be their king. And something in the
[1:11:49] heart of a believer causes them to to
[1:11:52] hold on to that promise that I was
[1:11:54] promised that I didn't have to come
[1:11:56] under the jurisdiction of a man-made
[1:11:58] religion. I I don't have to be under the
[1:12:00] jurisdiction of a man or the headship of
[1:12:02] a pope or something like this. He said,
[1:12:04] "See, brother said, and the true church
[1:12:07] has never changed its attitude. It can't
[1:12:10] be ruled by some board." I don't know
[1:12:12] what you want to call them out there,
[1:12:14] cardinals, bishops, popes, infallible
[1:12:17] ones, but we don't believe that. There
[1:12:18] ain't but one infallible one, and his
[1:12:21] name is Jesus Christ. He's our king.
[1:12:24] He's the King of Kings. He's the Lord of
[1:12:26] Lords. He's the one that's with us now
[1:12:28] in the form of the Holy Spirit. He's God
[1:12:31] in us, living among us, leading us and
[1:12:33] guiding us to the waters of life,
[1:12:37] showing just as he did in those early
[1:12:39] saints and martyrs that he's the Lord
[1:12:41] God of creation.
[1:12:44] He's still healing the sick. He's still
[1:12:46] raising the dead. He's still showing
[1:12:48] visions. He's still casting out devils.
[1:12:50] He's the same God. Brother said, "You
[1:12:52] can't find one place." I would challenge
[1:12:53] you today. Find one place where a pope
[1:12:55] ever raised the dead. found one place
[1:12:57] where they ever had the the the ability
[1:13:00] to to come out and do signs and wonders
[1:13:02] because the Bible never said signs and
[1:13:04] wonders would follow after the nickel.
[1:13:06] But my Bible said they would follow
[1:13:07] after believers. These signs shall
[1:13:09] follow them that believe. Not not the
[1:13:11] unbelievers, not the unrighteous, but
[1:13:13] these signs shall follow them that
[1:13:15] believe. They shall lay hands on the
[1:13:16] sick and they shall recover. They shall
[1:13:19] cast out devils in my name. They shall
[1:13:20] cast out devils.
[1:13:23] They went off after their denomination.
[1:13:25] Listen what he what they done. He said
[1:13:27] they consolidated for the denomination
[1:13:29] and they sold out their birthright to
[1:13:31] the Holy Ghost. Think about gave it
[1:13:33] away. He said, "But the true church
[1:13:35] still has the power of the Holy Spirit."
[1:13:38] You know what that means? She still lays
[1:13:40] hands on the sick and they still
[1:13:42] recover. She still preaches in the name
[1:13:45] of Jesus. She still hates that nickelan
[1:13:48] spirit. Amen. But look at what
[1:13:50] Constantine done. He built this great
[1:13:51] empire there. as they were building it,
[1:13:54] they these so-called Christians said,
[1:13:55] "See what they were? They weren't really
[1:13:57] Christians. They were professionals
[1:13:58] without the Holy Spirit." In other
[1:14:00] words, it was Christians, denominational
[1:14:02] Christians without the Holy Ghost. They
[1:14:04] were Christian by name. They were
[1:14:05] Christian by their gathering together.
[1:14:07] They were Christian by their taking
[1:14:08] communion. They were Christian by they
[1:14:10] kept their orders, but they rejected the
[1:14:12] leadership of the Holy Ghost. They had
[1:14:15] no signs and wonders among them. They
[1:14:17] claimed those things were in the past.
[1:14:18] And they had to set up a church to be
[1:14:20] the reign or to be the head. So you
[1:14:24] notice that this throne would change
[1:14:27] this headship changed in Rome from pagan
[1:14:30] Rome to pap Rome which meant in other
[1:14:32] words they ushered in a pope and now the
[1:14:35] pope became the head of Rome. So not is
[1:14:37] it just this great Roman Empire that
[1:14:39] went out with a great military might and
[1:14:41] emperors but now it became papal Rome.
[1:14:44] In other words, it was led by a great
[1:14:46] pope. It was a spiritual place. It was
[1:14:47] led by a spiritual leader and and under
[1:14:50] this under this paparoma or this
[1:14:51] priesthood, he would be from now on
[1:14:53] known as the holy father. He would be
[1:14:56] the descendant handed down from St.
[1:14:58] Peter. And so they will sit what what's
[1:15:00] called the throne of St. Peter today.
[1:15:03] What's called that you're going to sit
[1:15:04] on on St. Peter's throne. In other
[1:15:06] words, he has such an infallibility that
[1:15:08] whatever he says goes to every Catholic
[1:15:10] in the world. Any real Catholic, if the
[1:15:12] pope comes out and says this is the way
[1:15:13] it is, then that's the way it is. It
[1:15:15] doesn't matter how much it changes. One
[1:15:17] day it's okay for this. One day it's
[1:15:19] okay for that. One day they they change
[1:15:21] their whole religion. It's okay to have
[1:15:23] homosexuals in the pull pit now. It's
[1:15:24] okay to to to allow this. It it don't
[1:15:27] bother God no more. Fornication don't
[1:15:28] bother God no more. It's okay if you're
[1:15:30] a part. And so they they they built up
[1:15:32] this great Rome to where the pope became
[1:15:34] infallible. And then they venerated the
[1:15:37] saints and they became miniature gods.
[1:15:40] Notice this. Notice this transition
[1:15:42] here. the Roman Empire which had great
[1:15:44] Greek gods, you know, all the the gods
[1:15:46] of Poseid and all these stories that
[1:15:48] people now it's just all uh mythology
[1:15:51] and superhero movies that they but but
[1:15:52] but but then it was their gods these
[1:15:55] these great Greek gods. But notice how
[1:15:57] that when they turned to Paparon, they
[1:15:59] had to they they wasn't going to take
[1:16:01] that god no more because they had these
[1:16:02] nickelans and they they had made this
[1:16:04] agreement to be Christians and and so
[1:16:06] what they did is they took the saints of
[1:16:08] old and they made those saints miniature
[1:16:11] gods. So here where they had gods
[1:16:13] before, now they just made them out of
[1:16:15] the saints. A matter of fact, even
[1:16:16] Antipos that was martyed was made a
[1:16:18] saint. You can actually go to a Catholic
[1:16:20] bookstore today and you can buy a little
[1:16:22] image of St. Anttopos. Many people carry
[1:16:24] it around. They carry it on their
[1:16:25] necklaces. You can look online. You can
[1:16:27] get them right on Amazon. They they got
[1:16:28] him on bracelets and and and and he's a
[1:16:30] pretty good saint and they actually use
[1:16:32] him in case you ever have a toothache.
[1:16:34] He's the saint of toothaches. So if
[1:16:36] you're ever getting a toothache, you can
[1:16:37] call up on St. Anipos. you and and you
[1:16:39] use him to get rid of your toothaches.
[1:16:41] Well, you know, it ain't bad if you have
[1:16:43] a toothache. Maybe you need maybe you
[1:16:44] need a healing from it. But they have
[1:16:46] saints for all things. So they it didn't
[1:16:48] matter what what it was. If you needed
[1:16:50] healing, it had some throat related
[1:16:52] issues, it was St. Bla1. Or maybe if you
[1:16:54] was going to travel or go on a trip,
[1:16:56] needed a s a safe passage, you would
[1:16:58] call on St. Christopher to give you a
[1:17:00] safe passage. This is the the saint if
[1:17:02] you have a nervous or a mental disorder,
[1:17:04] then you can call on St. uh St. Dipna
[1:17:07] for your mental disorder. My goodness,
[1:17:09] they need to call on St. Dna.
[1:17:14] A hopeless cause, you call on St. Jude
[1:17:17] or about St. Raphael. If you find if
[1:17:19] you're looking for a spouse, looking for
[1:17:21] trying to find somebody to marry, call
[1:17:23] St. Raphael. He's the one that you can
[1:17:25] intercede on your behalf. St. Bernard,
[1:17:27] can you imagine if we was preaching this
[1:17:28] just now? It's St. Bernardino, the
[1:17:30] patron saint of communications and
[1:17:32] advertising and compulsive gambling. If
[1:17:34] you have a gambling problem, you could
[1:17:36] call on St. Bernardino to help with the
[1:17:38] gambling problem. You could, matter of
[1:17:41] fact, you could call St. Margaret and
[1:17:42] she was invoked for women's health and
[1:17:44] and and to have a good child birth or or
[1:17:46] or or uh St. uh uh uh Ponas, which was
[1:17:50] the saint of children and those who are
[1:17:52] suffering. St. Anne, the grandmother of
[1:17:54] Jesus, you often pray for her for
[1:17:56] motherhood or family issues. Or St.
[1:17:57] Vitus, who's the saint of children and
[1:18:00] those that have epilepsy. So, so it
[1:18:02] didn't matter what your ailment is.
[1:18:03] There's hundreds. I'm not going to read
[1:18:04] them all, but it it doesn't matter what
[1:18:05] your ailment is or what trouble that you
[1:18:07] get into. There's always a saint that
[1:18:09] you can call on as an intercessor. It's
[1:18:11] a miniature God. You they they can
[1:18:13] communicate with you. Say, "Brother, may
[1:18:14] I I I know you're I know you're you're
[1:18:16] making part of that up, but I'm really
[1:18:17] not." A matter of fact, can I just say
[1:18:19] it like this? I I went ahead and looked
[1:18:21] at it. I've got this straight off the
[1:18:23] Catholic teen website for all the the
[1:18:25] young people in the room that when you
[1:18:26] start your journey to be a good Catholic
[1:18:28] or or to make your walk with God, you go
[1:18:31] through what the Catholic calls a
[1:18:32] confirmation. And the confirmation is a
[1:18:34] sacrament that you take where you come
[1:18:36] up before the priest. And in this
[1:18:37] confirmation, it's a special sacrament.
[1:18:39] In other words, it's where you're going
[1:18:41] to receive baptismal grace from God.
[1:18:43] You're going to and and by doing this,
[1:18:45] you're going to be it's going to equip
[1:18:47] you with the Holy Spirit and you're
[1:18:48] going to fully become a Christian. And
[1:18:50] so it's a it's actually a mature
[1:18:52] affirmation of your faith. So when you
[1:18:54] come to confirmation, it means you came
[1:18:56] to an age that you can maturely accept
[1:18:58] this faith and say, "I'm going to walk
[1:19:00] in it and I'm come to my confirmation. I
[1:19:02] in other words, I'm of age to make this
[1:19:04] decision and and you're going to it's a
[1:19:06] call that you're going to participate
[1:19:07] and active in the church's mission." So
[1:19:09] through the confirmation, Catholics
[1:19:11] actually receive a special outpouring of
[1:19:13] the Holy Spirit and it empowers them to
[1:19:15] live out their faith more effectively
[1:19:17] and to witness and to witness Christ in
[1:19:19] their daily lives. But I want you to
[1:19:20] notice what happens in this
[1:19:22] confirmation. It's a great time because
[1:19:24] in the confirmation on the teen website,
[1:19:26] it says, I want to give you an example.
[1:19:28] The following list is for you to use as
[1:19:31] a starting point in your journey because
[1:19:33] when you make your confirmation, you
[1:19:36] have the opportunity to select a
[1:19:38] confirmation saint buddy. So that that
[1:19:40] that means when you make your
[1:19:42] confirmation for the rest of your life,
[1:19:44] you're tied to your confirmation saint.
[1:19:46] So you better pick a good one. You
[1:19:48] better pick one that so they tell you
[1:19:49] you need to study their life and find
[1:19:51] somebody that you can be saint buddy
[1:19:52] with so that when you get in trouble,
[1:19:54] brother Wesley, that you can call on
[1:19:56] your confirmation saint buddy that was
[1:19:57] there when you made your confirmation.
[1:19:59] He was a witness between you and God.
[1:20:01] I'm not saying this is a mockery. I'm
[1:20:02] preaching it right out of there right
[1:20:04] out of the team website. Once you make
[1:20:06] your confirmation with your saint buddy,
[1:20:08] he becomes a friend to you and and and
[1:20:11] you pick a saint that or a servant of
[1:20:13] God who speaks to you somehow. know
[1:20:15] their story, but mostly know the power
[1:20:17] of their prayer. Ask for their
[1:20:19] intercession just like you would ask for
[1:20:21] a prayer of your friends and say yes to
[1:20:23] a confirmation saint. That is it. It's
[1:20:25] just like saying yes, you may always
[1:20:27] pray for my poor and weary soul. So when
[1:20:30] you select a saint buddy or a
[1:20:31] confirmation saint, you're saying that
[1:20:33] that's the person that I want
[1:20:35] interceding for me for the rest of my
[1:20:37] life. And and this is the teen website,
[1:20:39] so they got a little bit of hype
[1:20:40] language in it, but it says, "How
[1:20:42] fantastic is that? I pray that in this
[1:20:44] process you don't just find a
[1:20:46] confirmation uh saint but you also and
[1:20:49] find a incredible lifetime friend. I
[1:20:52] thought my here we are in searching but
[1:20:54] that ain't all and I I'm not going
[1:20:55] through it all but but but but then they
[1:20:57] also have that that there's holy
[1:20:58] helpers. I mean and you get into trouble
[1:21:00] that none of the other saints that can
[1:21:02] get you out of. There's 14 holy helpers
[1:21:05] that you can call on that when you get
[1:21:06] in trouble that you can call a whole
[1:21:08] army of 14 if you want to to come and
[1:21:10] bail you out. I thought, "My God, I'm so
[1:21:13] glad that I don't have to call on 14
[1:21:16] holy helpers to get me out of trouble
[1:21:18] when I get myself in trouble. I'm so
[1:21:21] glad I don't have 14 holy helpers for me
[1:21:24] to get a hold of God. But my
[1:21:25] relationship with God, it don't require
[1:21:28] a saint buddy. It don't require a
[1:21:30] lifelong saint friend in order to get me
[1:21:32] through. But my Bible said God is our
[1:21:34] refuge and strength. He's a very present
[1:21:37] help in the time of trouble. Therefore,
[1:21:39] we will not fear. Though the earth be
[1:21:41] removed, though mountains be carried
[1:21:44] into the midst of the sea, though the
[1:21:45] waters roar with be troubled, though the
[1:21:48] mountains shake with a swelling thereof,
[1:21:50] but there is a river, the streams shall
[1:21:53] make glad the city of God, the holy
[1:21:55] place of the tabernacles of the most
[1:21:57] high. And God is in the midst of her,
[1:22:01] and she shall not be moved. Hallelujah.
[1:22:05] I thank God. He said, I'm a everpresent
[1:22:08] help. And when you call on me, I'm
[1:22:10] there. I'm there to hear your prayer. I
[1:22:12] ain't calling on an intercessor. I'm
[1:22:14] calling upon God. I ain't got I'm not
[1:22:16] moved by Let me tell you, friends, the
[1:22:18] church of the living God, she won't be
[1:22:20] moved by Catholicism. She won't be moved
[1:22:23] by denominationalism. She won't be moved
[1:22:26] by by nickelanism. She won't be moved by
[1:22:29] the doctrines of men. She ain't going to
[1:22:31] be bound by the seed of Satan.
[1:22:33] Hallelujah. She ain't going to be bound
[1:22:35] by Babylon. Right. But this bride church
[1:22:39] is unmovable.
[1:22:41] She's unmovable. Brother Wesley, he
[1:22:43] said, "How is she unmovable?" Here's
[1:22:44] what David said. He said, "Blessed is
[1:22:46] the man that walketh not in the counsel
[1:22:48] of the ungodly, but he shall be like a
[1:22:50] tree planted by the rivers of water."
[1:22:52] Watch how he depicts Christ. He depicts
[1:22:55] him as an unmovable tree. Said, "Here he
[1:22:58] is, a tree planted by the rivers of
[1:23:00] water. His leaves will not wither." He
[1:23:03] says, "See, when Christ come to the
[1:23:05] earth, he was God's perfect tree. David
[1:23:08] saw him in the psalm, he writes about
[1:23:10] him. His leaves won't wither, but when
[1:23:12] he comes on earth, what happened? The
[1:23:13] Roman power cut the tree down and hung
[1:23:15] him on a man-made tree." Said, "But then
[1:23:17] God raised him back up and set him on
[1:23:19] the right hand and sent the spirit back
[1:23:21] to make a bride for him like Adam should
[1:23:24] have had in the Garden of Eden."
[1:23:26] Says, see, so we hear the pope saying,
[1:23:28] "All the churches, come back to the
[1:23:30] mother church. Come back to the
[1:23:31] beginning. come back to Rome. But
[1:23:33] somebody find a historian that can tell
[1:23:35] you that the church started in Rome. It
[1:23:37] never started in Rome. This church
[1:23:38] started in the book of Acts on the day
[1:23:40] of Pentecost in Jerusalem. Hallelujah.
[1:23:43] 300 years later, the organization began
[1:23:46] in Rome. But the church started in
[1:23:48] Jerusalem. Say, see, God is raising up a
[1:23:52] bride tree for Christ with the same
[1:23:53] spirit that was in Christ. And he went
[1:23:56] to raising up that tree and notice what
[1:23:57] happened. That Roman bug got on it and
[1:23:59] be to break it off again. The palm worm
[1:24:02] ate on it. The cankerworm ate on it. The
[1:24:05] locust ate on it. So it was nothing down
[1:24:07] to a stump. But Joel said, "I will
[1:24:09] restore, sayeth the Lord." He said, "And
[1:24:11] that tree is going to come forth again,
[1:24:13] sir. For the bride tree is coming after
[1:24:14] the bride." Amen. It's a restoration of
[1:24:17] the spirit of God in the church. You
[1:24:19] think about what God is doing in this
[1:24:21] age. The Bible says all that was in God
[1:24:23] was poured into Christ. And all that was
[1:24:24] in Christ was poured into church. So you
[1:24:27] or into into the bride. You see, so if
[1:24:29] Christ is an unmovable tree, what's that
[1:24:31] say about you? I can tell you what what
[1:24:33] Paul said. He said, "Yet once more I
[1:24:35] shake not the earth only, but Jesus said
[1:24:37] he shall also shake the heavens." He
[1:24:39] said, "In this word, yet one more
[1:24:41] signify that the removing of those
[1:24:43] things that are shaken, but of the
[1:24:45] things that are made, but the things
[1:24:47] that which cannot be shaken, they shall
[1:24:49] remain." The things that can be shaken
[1:24:51] will be removed, and what can't be
[1:24:52] shaken, it shall remain. He said,
[1:24:54] "Wherefore we receive in a kingdom which
[1:24:57] cannot be moved, let us have grace
[1:24:59] whereby that we may serve God acceptably
[1:25:02] and with reverence and with godly fear."
[1:25:04] Oh friends, I don't know about you, but
[1:25:06] aren't you glad to be a part of a
[1:25:07] kingdom that cannot be moved.
[1:25:10] Brother Mark, a kingdom that cannot be
[1:25:12] shaken. This whole world is all shaken
[1:25:14] up. They're all What's going on? What's
[1:25:17] this call about? What what age are we
[1:25:19] living in? What what's it's communism
[1:25:21] again? It it's it's Catholicism again.
[1:25:23] It's all it's over again. They get all
[1:25:25] shook up with every world event that
[1:25:27] takes place. But I thank God that I'm
[1:25:29] not living in that world. I'm in a
[1:25:30] kingdom that cannot be moved. We're
[1:25:32] living in another realm. Paul said in
[1:25:34] heavenly places in Christ Jesus.
[1:25:36] Therefore, the things that shakes the
[1:25:37] world, it don't shake the bride. The
[1:25:39] things that moves the world, it don't
[1:25:41] move the bride because you know who you
[1:25:43] are, brother Mark. You're living under
[1:25:44] the life of that same tree that was
[1:25:46] planted by the rivers of water. And the
[1:25:48] very life that flowed through that tree
[1:25:50] is flowing through the bride of Jesus
[1:25:52] Christ today.
[1:25:54] kingdom that cannot be shaken. Paul
[1:25:57] said, "There is one God and there is one
[1:25:59] mediator between God and man. It's not a
[1:26:02] pope. It ain't a bishop. It ain't a
[1:26:05] priest." He said, "It's the man Jesus
[1:26:07] Christ." I say, "Somebody stand their
[1:26:10] feet and say, "Amen."
[1:26:13] He said, "There's one God and one
[1:26:14] mediator between God and man. Not a
[1:26:17] pope, not a not a priest. It's not a
[1:26:20] man. It's not a It's not a church. He
[1:26:23] said, "It's the man Jesus Christ." That
[1:26:26] means your relationship between you and
[1:26:28] God is between you and God alone. Isn't
[1:26:31] that what God's been trying to do all
[1:26:32] along? To lead the church by the Holy
[1:26:35] Ghost, to lead men and women by the Holy
[1:26:38] Ghost. This is the This is God's
[1:26:40] purpose. Re said, "That's our our
[1:26:42] relationship with God. It can't be
[1:26:44] between you and somebody else.
[1:26:47] It can't be between you and a priest.
[1:26:48] You can't go to a priest as you know
[1:26:51] people all all the time you you get to
[1:26:53] talking to somebody and they want to
[1:26:55] tell you everything. It's like you know
[1:26:56] what you don't have to tell me all that.
[1:26:58] I'm not a priest. I've said that many
[1:27:00] times. I'm not your priest.
[1:27:02] Yeah. I'm not the priest. You don't you
[1:27:05] don't have to come and tell me. I mean
[1:27:07] some of that stuff you just talk to the
[1:27:09] Lord about.
[1:27:11] You know we're not priests. You know,
[1:27:12] we're it's not about it's not about
[1:27:15] coming under under somebody or or
[1:27:18] letting somebody rule over your life or
[1:27:20] dictate your life. You ought to be men
[1:27:22] and women of God that's led by the Holy
[1:27:24] Ghost. And if God says do, then you
[1:27:27] should do. We get so wrapped up
[1:27:29] following men that we can't even do the
[1:27:31] will of God because we're worried about
[1:27:32] what the man's going to think. But when
[1:27:34] God says do, you do. When God says walk,
[1:27:37] you walk. When he says shout, you shout.
[1:27:39] He says move, you move. How could God
[1:27:42] ever use a man that wouldn't allow God
[1:27:44] to use you? That had to go have an
[1:27:46] intercessor between him and God. I'm not
[1:27:48] saying that you don't that you don't
[1:27:49] have elders that you can call on that
[1:27:51] can help you and and make decisions and
[1:27:53] pastors. God put that in the church for
[1:27:55] a reason to help, but not to dictate
[1:27:57] your life. In no means was it to dictate
[1:28:00] your life. Sons of God are led by the
[1:28:02] spirit of God. That's the Bible. They're
[1:28:06] led by the spirit of God. Reb said,
[1:28:08] "Christians, you must have a personal
[1:28:10] relationship to God." In order to be a
[1:28:13] son of God, you got to come in relation
[1:28:15] to God. He must be your father. There's
[1:28:18] our holy father. He must be your father
[1:28:21] in order for you to be his son. And only
[1:28:24] his sons and daughters are saved. Not
[1:28:26] members of a church, but sons and
[1:28:28] daughters. And there's only one thing
[1:28:30] that'll ever produce that, and that's a
[1:28:33] new birth. That's the only thing that'll
[1:28:35] produce a relationship with God. My
[1:28:38] isn't that wonderful?
[1:28:40] Our holy father, our heavenly father,
[1:28:45] brother Wesley, that has a desire to
[1:28:48] have a relationship with his children.
[1:28:50] You see how the devil would come through
[1:28:52] all of these years and to remove that
[1:28:54] and build up some great image and put
[1:28:57] some man or some system in between
[1:29:00] people and God to where you can't even
[1:29:02] go serve God like you like you want to.
[1:29:05] But then God would come in the last days
[1:29:07] and he would call us and say, "Come out
[1:29:10] of her, my people." Glory to God. Come
[1:29:12] out of her, my people, and be not a
[1:29:14] partaker of her sins. Amen. But be men
[1:29:17] and women. Have a relationship with God.
[1:29:19] I don't know about you, but it does
[1:29:21] something to me to think that God would
[1:29:22] go through all of this. Can I say
[1:29:24] trouble? He'd go through all of this
[1:29:26] trouble just to have a relationship with
[1:29:29] each one of us.
[1:29:31] That he would lay that in prophecy. That
[1:29:34] he would allow John to to be put in
[1:29:36] prison for two years. I imagine when
[1:29:37] John got thrown in prison, he was so mad
[1:29:39] at God. I didn't do nothing but do
[1:29:42] right. I I I I walked the line. I done
[1:29:44] what you told me. And now I'm getting
[1:29:46] locked up in a prison. throw out here on
[1:29:48] this crazy exiled island. Little did he
[1:29:52] know that God was using it. But to think
[1:29:54] that God would put him through that for
[1:29:56] you to see what you see today. Many
[1:29:59] women and many men have gone before us
[1:30:01] that have paid a great price for you and
[1:30:03] I to be able to hold this Bible and
[1:30:05] believe it. And friends, I've got news
[1:30:08] for you. No matter what it takes,
[1:30:10] there's going to be men and women
[1:30:11] that'll continue. They'll carry it on.
[1:30:14] They won't lay it down. There ain't
[1:30:15] nothing going to take it away from you.
[1:30:17] There's no organization there. There's
[1:30:19] nobody that you you think that this
[1:30:21] spirit of unity that is being brought
[1:30:22] about to the world is a forceful thing.
[1:30:24] Let me tell you, it's so deceiving that
[1:30:27] it looks like the right thing. It's not.
[1:30:29] They ain't coming around with whips
[1:30:30] making everybody doing it. They're
[1:30:31] saying, "My shouldn't we all be
[1:30:33] together? Shouldn't we all come under?"
[1:30:35] After all, what would it hurt if there
[1:30:37] wasn't no more wars anymore?
[1:30:40] Think about it's just a deceiving way to
[1:30:42] take the power of God away from the sons
[1:30:45] and daughters of God. Friends, let me
[1:30:47] tell you, we don't join a church to be a
[1:30:49] member, but we be we we need to be born
[1:30:51] of the spirit of God and be a son and
[1:30:54] daughter of God. Amen. How many believes
[1:30:57] that tonight? Can we sing that song? I
[1:30:59] pledge allegiance to the lamb. Do you
[1:31:00] know that?
[1:31:04] I
[1:31:05] pledge
[1:31:08] alce to the
[1:31:11] lamb with all my
[1:31:15] strength and with all I am. I will seek
[1:31:21] to
[1:31:23] honor his
[1:31:26] command. I pledge
[1:31:30] alance
[1:31:33] to the
[1:31:36] lamb. I have heard how
[1:31:40] Christians long
[1:31:43] ago. They were brought
[1:31:46] before a tyant's throne. And they were
[1:31:51] told that he would spare their lives if
[1:31:57] they would
[1:31:59] renounce the name of
[1:32:02] Christ. But one by
[1:32:05] one they chose to
[1:32:08] die. That the son of God they would not
[1:32:15] deny. Like a great
[1:32:18] angelic choir sings. I can almost hear.
[1:32:24] I wonder how many would sing with them
[1:32:26] tonight. I say I pledge my
[1:32:31] alance to the lamb. For with all my
[1:32:37] strength and with all I am, I will seek
[1:32:43] to
[1:32:44] honor him. is coming. I pledge
[1:32:50] alce to the
[1:32:55] land. Well, now the years have
[1:32:59] come and the years have
[1:33:02] gone, but the cause of
[1:33:06] Jesus still goes
[1:33:08] on. Now our time has come to count the
[1:33:15] cost to reject this
[1:33:18] world and raise the
[1:33:21] cross. So one by one let us live our
[1:33:27] lives for the one who
[1:33:30] died to give us life. Till the trumpet
[1:33:36] sounds on that final day. Well, let us
[1:33:41] gladly
[1:33:43] stand and boldly say, I pledge my
[1:33:49] allegiance to the land. For with all my
[1:33:55] strength, and with all that I am, I will
[1:33:59] seek to
[1:34:01] honor his command. I pledge my
[1:34:08] alance to the lamb. I pledge my
[1:34:14] alance to the lamb. For with all my
[1:34:20] strength and with all that I am, I will
[1:34:24] seek to
[1:34:27] honor his command. I pledge
[1:34:33] alance to the lamb.
[1:34:38] Now the years have come and the years
[1:34:42] have gone, but the cause of
[1:34:47] Jesus still goes
[1:34:49] on. Now a time has
[1:34:52] come to count the cost to reject this
[1:34:59] world and embrace the cross.
[1:35:03] So one by one let us live our
[1:35:08] lives for the son who
[1:35:11] died to give us life till the trumpet
[1:35:17] sounds on that.
[1:35:21] Let us proudly
[1:35:23] stand and boldly say, I pledge my
[1:35:30] allegiance to the Lamb. For with all my
[1:35:36] strength, and with all that I am, I will
[1:35:40] seek to honor his command. I pledge to
[1:35:48] thee.
[1:35:53] [Music]
[1:35:55] Let the worshipers arise.
[1:35:59] [Music]
[1:36:04] Yes, my
[1:36:07] Lord. I'm surrendering my
[1:36:13] all. I surrender.
[1:36:19] [Music]
[1:36:22] Father, I see that you are
[1:36:25] drawing line in the sand. I want to be
[1:36:29] standing by your side,
[1:36:32] holding your hand.
[1:36:38] [Music]
[1:36:58] I'm surrendering
[1:37:03] [Music]
[1:37:04] my surrender to the
[1:37:08] king. I hear it grow louder.
[1:37:13] The song of your redeemed as the saints
[1:37:17] of every
[1:37:18] nation are awakened to sing from our
[1:37:22] hearts to come
[1:37:25] to hear the
[1:37:30] praises to the king. Let the worippers
[1:37:38] arise. Let the sons and daughter
[1:37:41] [Music]
[1:37:44] sing. I'm surrendering my
