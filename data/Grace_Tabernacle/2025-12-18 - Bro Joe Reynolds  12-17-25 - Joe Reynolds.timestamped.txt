[29:56] wonderful thing it is, Lord, to be able
[29:59] to see one another and [music] and shake
[30:02] one another's hands. And Lord, to
[30:04] fellowship one with another, but Lord,
[30:07] it's even a greater time, Lord, that we
[30:09] could come and have communion with you.
[30:11] And Lord, that we could hear from your
[30:13] word and it would be an encouragement to
[30:15] us, Lord, a healing to our bodies, Lord.
[30:18] We just ask you tonight, God, that you
[30:21] would move upon each one, Lord, every
[30:23] need, every hand that's raised, [music]
[30:25] Lord, that you could use our brother
[30:26] tonight to be a a minister, Lord, that
[30:29] would just use the the word of the Lord
[30:31] to be a help to all of us. And Lord, we
[30:33] just give you the liberty to speak. We
[30:35] ask you to come now in Jesus name.
[30:37] [music] Amen.
[30:40] I bless your name.
[30:48] not
[31:00] your
[31:08] in your [singing] mouth.
[31:14] Just reach out and pray.
[31:17] &gt;&gt; [music]
[31:21] &gt;&gt; and defy
[31:22] those [music] chains
[31:28] and they [singing] will fall
[31:34] [snorts] in Jesus
[31:36] name.
[31:41] Oh, I bless your name.
[31:47] Lord, I bless [music]
[31:50] your [singing] name.
[31:52] Yes, my Lord,
[31:56] I give you [singing] honor.
[32:01] Yes, I [music] give
[32:03] you [singing] praise
[32:07] [music]
[32:08] for you are [singing] the life,
[32:15] the truth, the way
[32:19] [singing]
[32:25] to [music]
[32:28] God bless your name.
[32:32] Some midnight hour,
[32:35] some [music] midnight
[32:37] [singing] hour.
[32:41] [music]
[32:42] Oh, if you should find,
[32:49] you're [music] in [singing]
[32:50] a prison.
[32:56] Oh, in your mind. [music]
[33:01] Lord, listen now. Reach out and pray.
[33:09] [music] Oh, you go ahead and defy those
[33:12] chains
[33:15] [music]
[33:16] and they will fall
[33:23] in [music and singing] Jesus
[33:25] name.
[33:27] Oh, go ahead and bless his name. Oh, I
[33:30] bless your [singing and music] name.
[33:36] Oh, I bless [music]
[33:38] your name.
[33:43] Oh, I give you honor.
[33:49] Yes, Lord. I give you [music] praise.
[33:55] is
[33:57] you are the life,
[34:04] the truth, the way, [music]
[34:07] of truth, and [singing] the only way.
[34:11] Bless your name.
[34:18] I bless your [music] name. Oh, sing that
[34:21] chorus one more time. Can you just lift
[34:24] your hands to him?
[34:26] &gt;&gt; Let's magnify the Lord God on high for a
[34:29] moment
[34:32] as your [music]
[34:34] name.
[34:36] Oh, don't you feel his presence?
[34:39] Give [singing] you [music] honor.
[34:43] Oh yes, my Lord, I give you praise.
[34:48] [music]
[34:51] You are the life, [music]
[34:59] the [singing] truth, the only way.
[35:04] [music]
[35:06] I bless your name.
[35:12] I [music and singing] bless
[35:14] your name,
[35:21] Lord Jesus.
[35:25] Lord, we thank you, Lord, for such
[35:27] [music] a time as this, Lord, that we
[35:29] could gather around and feel your
[35:33] presence so rich and pure, Father,
[35:37] like in our trapped in humanity, Lord,
[35:41] our shortcomings and so many failures,
[35:44] Lord God,
[35:46] we come together in unity tonight, Lord,
[35:49] to rally around your precious anointing
[35:51] and your precious word, Lord. Lord,
[35:54] Lord, we pray, Lord God, that the window
[35:56] of heaven will open up tonight, Lord
[35:58] God, and come down and have an
[36:01] experience with us one more time, Lord
[36:04] God, and let our hearts burn within,
[36:06] Lord God, as we have fellowship one with
[36:09] you, Lord God.
[36:12] For what service would it be if you
[36:15] wasn't invited, Lord? People want to
[36:17] give you a special invitation to come,
[36:20] Lord, and have your own way here this
[36:23] evening, Lord God, as we commit this
[36:25] time into your hands, Lord, as we were
[36:28] sanging this precious song, Lord. Lord,
[36:31] we couldn't help to feel your presence
[36:34] as you come by our way, Lord God, to let
[36:36] us know you're in the midst and good
[36:39] things happen when you come around, Lord
[36:41] God.
[36:42] I pray Lord God, miracles begin to
[36:45] happen, things begin to change. Lord
[36:48] God,
[36:49] when Jesus came by, the dead was raised,
[36:54] the lame walk, the deaf could hear, Lord
[36:57] God. Lord, I believe that you're the
[37:00] same yesterday, today, and forever,
[37:02] Lord.
[37:06] And we ask you once again, Lord, to come
[37:09] bless this portion of the service, Lord
[37:12] God. Lord, we pray, Lord, that you'll
[37:14] bless our the pastor, Lord, and for his
[37:18] labors, Lord. We pray that you'll bless
[37:20] Brother Mark for his labors tonight,
[37:22] Lord, coming and giving his heart,
[37:24] preparing the service, Lord.
[37:28] Now we ask you to come Lord and speak to
[37:31] a vessel once again and anoint the ears
[37:33] to hear in Jesus Christ's wonderful
[37:36] name.
[37:38] And the believer says, "Amen." Do you
[37:41] love the Lord?
[37:43] Ain't it certainly good to be in his
[37:45] presence this evening? [snorts]
[37:48] Hallelujah.
[37:50] I invite you to Romans chapter 4.
[37:55] We like to minister tonight on the
[37:57] worship of the true believer.
[38:04] The worship of the true believer. Romans
[38:07] chapter 4:E 16.
[38:09] Therefore, it is of faith that I might
[38:13] be of grace to the end the promise might
[38:16] be sure to all the seed, not that that
[38:19] only which is of the law, but to that
[38:21] also which is of the faith of Abraham,
[38:24] who is a father of us all. As written,
[38:27] I've made thee a father of many nations,
[38:30] before him whom you believed, even God,
[38:33] who quickened the dead, and call those
[38:35] things which be not as though they were.
[38:40] Who against hope believed in hope, that
[38:44] he might become the father of many
[38:46] nations, according that which was
[38:48] spoken, according to that which was
[38:51] already spoken, so shall thy seed be.
[38:54] And being not weak in faith, he
[38:58] considered not his own body now dead
[39:02] when he was about a hundred years old.
[39:05] Neither yet the deadness of Sarah's
[39:08] womb. He staggered not at the promise of
[39:12] God through unbelief, but was strong in
[39:16] faith the revelation of the will of God,
[39:21] giving glory to God. He was magnifying
[39:25] God in the face of opposition
[39:29] and being fully persuaded that what he
[39:32] had promised he was able also to
[39:36] perform. Hallelujah. Can you can you
[39:38] just bow your heads one more time? If
[39:41] you have a need upon your heart, just
[39:42] make it known to the Lord. Oh Lord sees
[39:45] every one of your hands tonight. Lord
[39:47] Jesus, once again, Lord, we ask you to
[39:50] come in a special way. Anoint your word.
[39:52] We read, Lord God, anoint every hand
[39:55] that was risen. Lord God, we commit this
[39:57] time into your hands one more time in
[40:00] Jesus Christ's wonderful name. And the
[40:02] bride says, God bless you. You can have
[40:05] your seats tonight.
[40:08] I thought it was striking how Paul would
[40:11] say here
[40:13] that who against hope he believed in
[40:15] hope that he might become the father of
[40:18] many nation according to that which was
[40:20] spoken. and the verse before calling
[40:23] those things
[40:25] which be not
[40:27] &gt;&gt; as though they were.
[40:30] &gt;&gt; And nobody knew how Abraham felt as much
[40:35] as Abraham knew how he was feeling. And
[40:38] brother Brandham, brother Roy said like
[40:40] this, the greatest enemy that I have is
[40:43] not brother Roy or brother Phil or
[40:45] brother Morgan, but it's Joe Reynolds.
[40:47] And he said William Mary and Brandham.
[40:49] He's a guy I'm trapped in. He's a guy I
[40:52] deal with every day. And that was the
[40:54] same way Abraham wasn't exempt from
[40:57] humanity. He knew exactly how much
[41:00] pressure was on his life. But he chose
[41:03] rather deny the facts of life.
[41:06] &gt;&gt; He refused to hear the the negative
[41:09] report of hell. Amen. And just to
[41:13] believe God's promise and to prove God's
[41:16] word was true. It may seem impossible,
[41:19] but go ahead and give God praise.
[41:22] &gt;&gt; Amen. And that's exactly what Abraham
[41:25] did. He staggered not at the promise of
[41:28] God behel, but was strong in faith.
[41:31] Believe in the revelation of the will of
[41:34] God in HIS OWN LIFE OUTSIDE of how he
[41:38] felt, regardless of his feelings,
[41:40] regardless how dead Sarah's womb was or
[41:43] how old Abraham was. Amen. He staggered
[41:46] not at the promise of God because he
[41:48] wasn't leaning to his own understanding.
[41:51] He was taking God's promises over his
[41:54] feelings and believing God's word.
[41:57] Abraham didn't ask his body for
[41:59] permission.
[42:00] &gt;&gt; Abraham didn't negotiate with science.
[42:05] &gt;&gt; Amen. He did he he didn't consult his
[42:08] fear or his doubts.
[42:12] He just simply believed
[42:16] &gt;&gt; and he worshiped.
[42:18] &gt;&gt; What an effective soldier. Wasn't going
[42:20] to let present conditions
[42:23] stop his praise. For the Bible tells us,
[42:26] let everything that has breath.
[42:28] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[42:30] &gt;&gt; Amen. God gives the promises of his word
[42:34] and he will prove it or bring it to pass
[42:38] regardless of feelings or how old
[42:40] Abraham was. He sets the boundaries and
[42:44] he anoints the believer's footprints to
[42:47] prove his word. You believe that? Let me
[42:50] read you this quote. But the Bible says,
[42:51] "But Abraham didn't stagger anywhere at
[42:55] all.
[42:57] He believed that God was able to
[43:00] perform. Perform just simply means to
[43:03] bring past
[43:05] &gt;&gt; that which he had promised. So it didn't
[43:08] didn't matter how he felt or what he
[43:11] could see
[43:13] &gt;&gt; or the conditions. He magnify God. The
[43:17] worship of a true believer magnifies God
[43:21] in the face of opposition.
[43:24] &gt;&gt; Amen. And he goes on. He said God would
[43:27] prove his word no matter how long it
[43:30] took. But instead of getting weaker
[43:35] &gt;&gt; each time like we are prone to do,
[43:38] ABRAHAM GOT STRONGER ALL [screaming] the
[43:42] time. HIS BODY WAS DECLARING one thing.
[43:46] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah, brother David. But a
[43:48] revelation was proving something else IN
[43:52] THE FACE OF OPPOSITION. SAYS, "EXTRA,
[43:55] EXTRA, READ ALL ABOUT IT. MY WIFE'S
[43:57] GOING TO HAVE A BABY RIGHT IN THE FACE
[43:59] OF OPPOSITION."
[44:02] &gt;&gt; Besides getting weaker as his body was,
[44:07] his soul was getting stronger.
[44:09] &gt;&gt; Oh, I think we can do it tonight.
[44:12] &gt;&gt; Amen. He says, he says, "Tomorrow it'll
[44:15] be miracle."
[44:18] That was God. Listen to what brother
[44:21] would say. That was God. THAT WAS GOD in
[44:25] Abraham. For he KNOW THAT GOD PROVED ALL
[44:29] OF HIS words to be sold. If his children
[44:33] would only take his word.
[44:36] &gt;&gt; Who's his children tonight? So he can
[44:39] prove it.
[44:41] &gt;&gt; Sister Eve, listen to this tonight. His
[44:44] children only take HIS WORD. SO GOD, HE
[44:48] can prove it by you.
[44:52] That's the only way he can prove his
[44:55] word. HE DOESN'T PROVE IT BY
[44:57] UNBELIEVERS.
[44:59] They can't be proved. THEY ARE
[45:02] UNBELIEVERS. THEY ARE DOUBTERS. BUT IT'S
[45:05] NOT TO UNBELIEVERS.
[45:08] IT'S TO HIM THAT BELIEVES.
[45:11] &gt;&gt; And if HE COULD FIND SOMEBODY WHO WILL
[45:14] BELIEVE HIS WORD, HE WILL PROVE HIS WORD
[45:18] BY YOU.
[45:20] HALLELUJAH. And sometimes sickness and
[45:23] things happen to us that way that God
[45:27] can prove himself.
[45:30] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. God sets the bounds and we
[45:33] are here to allow him to prove it that
[45:36] he's the same yesterday, today, and
[45:40] forever.
[45:42] Exodus 23 and30 says, "By little
[45:46] and little I will dry them out before
[45:49] thee until they be increased and inherit
[45:53] the land. I will set thy bounds from the
[45:56] Red Sea, even to the sea of the
[45:59] Philistines, and from the desert unto
[46:02] the river. For I will deliver the
[46:04] inhabitants of the land in your hand.
[46:08] and thou shalt drive them out before
[46:11] thee. All he needs is his children to
[46:14] take his word.
[46:17] &gt;&gt; Amen. He needs hands tonight.
[46:20] &gt;&gt; Come on, WORSHIPPERS. HE NEEDS FEET.
[46:23] &gt;&gt; HE NEEDS BODIES. HE NEEDS BELIEVERS.
[46:27] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. HEY, BUT HE SAYS, BROTHER
[46:29] BENJI, he said, I'm going to set the
[46:31] bounds. THIS IS NOT THAT YOU'RE GOING TO
[46:34] DECREE IT. I'M going to decree this. I'm
[46:36] going to set MY WORD. I'M GOING TO SET
[46:39] MY COVENANT. I'M GOING TO PROVIDE THE
[46:41] ANOINTING. I'M GOING TO GIVE YOU EXACTLY
[46:43] what you have need of TO OVERCOME IT. I
[46:46] JUST NEED A BODY.
[46:48] &gt;&gt; I JUST NEED SOMEBODY TO YIELD. I JUST
[46:51] NEED SOMEBODY TO SAY, "I WILL GO. I'LL
[46:54] TAKE IT. I'LL RUN."
[46:57] &gt;&gt; OH, CHURCH. I think Brother Jared, I
[46:59] believe it's the END TIME. IT'S RIGHT at
[47:01] the END OF ALL TIMES. IT AIN'T TIME TO
[47:04] STOP. IT'S TIME TO SPRINT. AMEN. When I
[47:07] run relay, WHEN I WAS IN HIGH SCHOOL, I
[47:09] KNOW I DON'T LOOK like I could do that,
[47:11] but I once did. AMEN. AMEN. WE RUN A
[47:14] RELAY AND we didn't WE PUT THE FASTEST
[47:16] MAN
[47:18] &gt;&gt; at the end
[47:20] &gt;&gt; cuz you know the the ONES THAT WAS GOOD
[47:23] BUT WASN'T the best, THEY RAN THE RACE
[47:25] GOOD, BUT THEY NEEDED THAT SPRINTER at
[47:28] the end
[47:30] &gt;&gt; that they COULD REACH OUT AND HAND IT TO
[47:32] ANNIAH. NIGHT COULD TAKE OFF.
[47:35] &gt;&gt; AMEN. And that THEIR COACH KNOWS, AMEN,
[47:38] WE may be a little behind, but we have
[47:41] what we need IN THIS LAST DAY. AMEN. TO
[47:45] sprint and run and be ABLE TO TAKE IT BY
[47:49] FORCE. OH, I'M GOING TO GET AHEAD OF
[47:51] myself tonight. But God is good, church.
[47:54] Amen. This is the end.
[47:58] &gt;&gt; I'm Who's ready to run?
[48:01] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. God sets the bounds.
[48:05] &gt;&gt; He needs a body. He needs a believer.
[48:10] &gt;&gt; Boy, I just feel his presence tonight. I
[48:13] just feel his presence. He just needs a
[48:15] believer
[48:18] &gt;&gt; that he can hand it off to
[48:20] &gt;&gt; and prove his word.
[48:22] &gt;&gt; Can I say it like this, PASTOR MATT? HE
[48:24] NEEDS A BODY tonight to prove his word.
[48:27] HE NEEDS SOMEBODY TO TAKE GOD'S word and
[48:31] he's going to prove it through you.
[48:35] &gt;&gt; Joshua and Caleb, after all they seen,
[48:39] Satan thought he silenced those
[48:40] believers.
[48:42] THEY MAGNIFIED GOD IN THE face of
[48:45] opposition.
[48:47] GOD SET THE BOUNDS AND HIS soldiers was
[48:50] there to enforce it, to prove his word.
[48:54] Remember, Brother Brenham would say it
[48:56] like this. He put the moon as a guard.
[49:00] &gt;&gt; He said with a gun over his shoulder
[49:04] and he sets the boundaries of the sea.
[49:07] And the moon, a body,
[49:10] holds the sea. HE STOOD BY THE BANKS AND
[49:13] WATCHED THE ANGRY WAVES TRYING TO lick
[49:15] it out. But the moon says, "Hold your
[49:18] peace. GOD SETS THE BOUNDARIES and I'm
[49:22] the guard." Hallelujah. Amen. The
[49:25] opposition couldn't silence them
[49:28] &gt;&gt; because the worship doesn't need
[49:30] permission.
[49:31] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[49:33] &gt;&gt; It was a negative party.
[49:38] &gt;&gt; It was a negative party until worship
[49:41] showed up.
[49:44] [crying]
[49:45] &gt;&gt; Can I say like this? Worship
[49:48] doesn't check the atmosphere.
[49:50] &gt;&gt; It changes it.
[49:53] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. that changes it. They didn't
[49:56] deny the giants wasn't there. Oh, y'all.
[49:58] They still they seen it. They didn't
[50:02] deny that they wasn't there. THEY JUST
[50:05] REFUSE ALLOWED TO SILENCE THEIR PRAISE.
[50:08] &gt;&gt; WHEN THE PORCH SAYS NO, THEY SAID YES.
[50:13] &gt;&gt; WHEN THE PORCH SAYS THEY COULDN'T GO,
[50:15] THEY SAID I CAN. I'M MORE THAN ABLE TO
[50:19] TAKE THE LAND. WHEN SATAN SAID RETREAT,
[50:22] THEY SAID [screaming] CHARGE BECAUSE
[50:24] THEY WASN'T LOOKING AT WHAT THEY COULD
[50:27] SEE. THEY WAS LOOKING BY FAITH AND SAY
[50:31] GOD GAVE THE PROMISE AND HE ONLY NEEDS A
[50:34] worshipper
[50:37] &gt;&gt; to prove God's word to be true.
[50:41] &gt;&gt; And when the enemy comes in like a
[50:43] flood,
[50:44] &gt;&gt; he's going to lift up a brine.
[50:47] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. a mark,
[50:50] &gt;&gt; a Martha Morgan. He's going to lift up a
[50:53] standard, a body to prove his word to be
[50:56] true.
[50:58] &gt;&gt; What is the mystery
[51:00] of the thunder of God thundering out?
[51:04] &gt;&gt; Brother, I would say like this, Sister
[51:06] Sandy, he said, "In Jessville, Indiana,
[51:08] we need thousands of lived voices.
[51:13] &gt;&gt; The thunder of God thundering out."
[51:17] Hallelujah.
[51:18] &gt;&gt; The thunder is only a noise. It's a
[51:21] sound. It's a sound effect
[51:25] &gt;&gt; of a power of another force.
[51:30] &gt;&gt; It's only THE SOUND EFFECTS THAT a
[51:33] greater power is here.
[51:35] &gt;&gt; The thunder is THE EVIDENCE THAT GOD'S
[51:38] NOT DEAD, HE'S ALIVE. WHAT WE NEED TODAY
[51:42] IS THOUSANDS OF LID VOICES THUNDERING of
[51:47] God thundering out. He said thundering
[51:50] out sweetness.
[51:53] Lord help us.
[51:55] &gt;&gt; Sounding out holiness. God help us.
[51:59] &gt;&gt; Sounding out purity.
[52:02] &gt;&gt; SOUNDING OUT UNDEFILED LIVES.
[52:06] &gt;&gt; THUNDERING OUT. I'M READING WHAT THE
[52:08] PROPHET SAID. WALKING AROUND IN THE
[52:10] EARTH TODAY without a blemish. Yes, sir.
[52:15] Real Christians. That's the thunder
[52:19] against the enemy. WHAT WE NEED TODAY IS
[52:22] THOUSANDS of live voices. The mystery of
[52:26] the thunder is the worship of the
[52:29] believer.
[52:33] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Joshua and Caleb was live
[52:35] voices that hell cannot silence
[52:39] &gt;&gt; their praise.
[52:42] Extra extra. Read all about it.
[52:45] That's my land.
[52:47] &gt;&gt; That's my land.
[52:49] I saw it. I stood there. The promises
[52:52] was real. The negative sounds was trying
[52:55] to drown out
[52:58] the promise of God.
[53:01] He sent those spies over. 10 came back
[53:04] was drowning out
[53:07] trying to silence the promise of God.
[53:12] Oh, but brother Ram says, "Brother Roy,
[53:15] he'll never leave us without a witness."
[53:18] Right in the midst of all the
[53:19] negativity, here come a Joshua and
[53:22] Caleb.
[53:24] &gt;&gt; They couldn't silence and praise. The
[53:27] negative DIDN'T SILENCE AND PRAISE. IT
[53:30] JUST AMPLIFIED IT.
[53:32] &gt;&gt; Abraham refused to let the trials he was
[53:35] facing steal his praise.
[53:38] Satan tries to break your silence
[53:42] or break your worship.
[53:47] There's a slogan says, "A cracked bail
[53:51] can still make sounds, but a broken bail
[53:54] is silent."
[53:56] Satan's goal is to break you
[53:59] &gt;&gt; to silence your worship.
[54:02] &gt;&gt; He tried this when the God gave him the
[54:06] okay
[54:09] to torment Job and afflict his body.
[54:15] And he done everything he could to Job
[54:20] to try to get Job to curse his God.
[54:25] Can I say it like this tonight, Sister
[54:28] Tammy? We can be checked,
[54:33] &gt;&gt; but a true believer can never be put in
[54:36] checkmate.
[54:38] &gt;&gt; I know we've heard the story many times
[54:40] of the picture in the L and how that
[54:43] they walked by and and the picture that
[54:46] spoke thousands of words was it was it
[54:49] was if you walked by it looked like the
[54:51] discouraged man. He was cracked. He was
[54:54] beating. Amen. It looked like there was
[54:56] no hope. And it took a messenger to come
[54:59] down. They had the experience to come
[55:02] down and look at that picture that
[55:04] looked like there was no hope. THAT
[55:06] LOOKED LIKE SOCIETY. THERE WERE NOBODY
[55:07] TO BE SAVED IN LATER OA. AMEN. But it
[55:10] TOOK A MESSENGER WITH A MESSAGE FROM THE
[55:13] KING TO COME DOWN AND LET US KNOW. AMEN.
[55:16] WE MAY BE CRACKED.
[55:18] &gt;&gt; WE MAY BE AMEN. WE MAY BE BURIED BY THE
[55:22] THINGS THAT WE CAME INTO THIS WORLD
[55:24] shaped into,
[55:26] &gt;&gt; but we're not in checkmate.
[55:32] &gt;&gt; And he COULD PROVE THIS BY Job
[55:35] as a devil brought everything he could
[55:39] up against Job. Bear with me a few
[55:41] minutes.
[55:44] Job be to lose his cattle. Job be to
[55:48] lose his family. Job be to lose his
[55:50] houses. Job be his land be to be burnt
[55:53] up.
[55:56] One trial after another. Wave after
[56:00] wave, blow at the blow.
[56:04] You could touch his body,
[56:07] try to make him break.
[56:09] SATAN TRIED [screaming] TO BURY JOB.
[56:14] &gt;&gt; But there was a worshipper
[56:17] inside of Job. A warrior
[56:20] &gt;&gt; that can never be broken.
[56:22] &gt;&gt; Amen. Hell didn't know this,
[56:25] &gt;&gt; BUT GOD DID.
[56:28] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. AMEN. GOD WHO'S RICH IN
[56:31] MERCY. SATAN TRIED TO BURY HIM.
[56:35] Hell can never mute
[56:38] &gt;&gt; our worship
[56:40] &gt;&gt; and praise.
[56:43] &gt;&gt; It only amplifies it.
[56:47] Hell was trying to bury Job.
[56:54] &gt;&gt; But all along they was planning a
[56:56] testimony.
[56:57] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[56:59] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. AMEN. JOB. THEY THOUGHT THEY
[57:02] WAS BEARING Job
[57:05] until a place
[57:07] where Job, Brother R would say, Job
[57:09] walked over there and looked out the
[57:12] curtains of time and he seen out there
[57:15] the beautiful trees, the green leaves
[57:18] whipping in the wind.
[57:20] Oh church, he might have been cracked.
[57:24] He might have been scarred. HIS SPIRIT
[57:26] MIGHT HAVE BEEN TORN. AMEN. But Job was
[57:29] never in checkmate. HE WAS NEVER BROKEN.
[57:33] THEY THAT THAT WAS SILENCE the
[57:36] worshipper within him. And when he BEGAN
[57:39] TO SEE RESURRECTION, WHEN HE BEGAN TO
[57:42] SEE GOD IN NATURE, THERE WAS SOMETHING
[57:45] INSIDE OF JOB THAT BEGAN TO SCREAM OUT
[57:48] IN HIS CALAMITY.
[57:52] &gt;&gt; AMEN. A TESTIMONY WAS BORN.
[57:57] The Lord giveth
[57:59] and the Lord taketh away. BLESSED BE THE
[58:04] name of the Lord. Hallelujah. I KNOW
[58:09] [screaming]
[58:10] MY REDEEMER.
[58:12] I KNOW MY REDEEMER LIVES.
[58:15] The king had one more move
[58:19] &gt;&gt; and that one more move was restoration
[58:21] for Job
[58:23] &gt;&gt; to prove his word.
[58:27] &gt;&gt; Exodus 10 and 24 says Pharaoh called
[58:30] unto Moses and said, "I'm hurrying. Go
[58:33] you serve the Lord only. Let your flocks
[58:36] and your herds be stayed. Let your
[58:38] little ones also go with you." And Moses
[58:40] said, "Thou must give us all the
[58:42] sacrifices."
[58:45] And Moses said, "Thou must give us also
[58:48] sacrifices and burnt offerings that we
[58:51] may sacrifice unto the Lord our God."
[58:54] Our cattle also shall go with us. There
[58:57] shall not be a hoof left behind. For
[59:00] therefore must we take the serve the
[59:02] Lord our God, and we know not with what
[59:04] must serve the Lord until we come
[59:06] together. We will not. In other words,
[59:09] Moses telling him, "Amen, I'm not
[59:11] compromising my worship.
[59:14] &gt;&gt; I'm not compromising my praise.
[59:17] &gt;&gt; AMEN. I'M NOT LEAVING a hook behind.
[59:21] You're not taking my sacrifice cuz my
[59:23] worship has TO COME WITH SACRIFICE."
[59:26] AMEN. MOSES WAS TELLING HIM, "I'VE BEEN
[59:28] I DIDN'T COME DOWN HERE TO COMPROMISE
[59:31] WITH THE DEVIL. I'M NOT GOING TO
[59:33] COMPROMISE WITH MY PRAISE OR MY WORSHIP.
[59:36] WHEN TRIALS COME, I'M NOT COMPROMISING
[59:39] my praise.
[59:41] &gt;&gt; In the face of opposition,
[59:46] &gt;&gt; we've been through it.
[59:47] &gt;&gt; You've been through it.
[59:49] &gt;&gt; We've been through some great
[59:50] opposition.
[59:52] I've been through my Gethsemane.
[59:57] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:00:00] And I'm still standing.
[1:00:03] &gt;&gt; IT'S THE PROOF THAT I CAN BE CHECKED.
[1:00:06] BUT NOT BROKEN.
[1:00:10] &gt;&gt; NO MATTER WHAT, THIS BAIL CAN NEVER BE
[1:00:13] BROKEN.
[1:00:14] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. AMEN. The in the face of
[1:00:17] opposition, I'm not compromising my
[1:00:20] praise.
[1:00:21] &gt;&gt; I'm going to clap.
[1:00:23] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:00:25] &gt;&gt; I'm going to stop.
[1:00:28] &gt;&gt; I'm going to run.
[1:00:29] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:00:30] &gt;&gt; I'm going to dance.
[1:00:34] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. NO MATTER WHAT IT TAKES, I'M
[1:00:37] NOT GOING TO COMPROMISE MY WORSHIP.
[1:00:41] HELL'S AGAINST US. HELL'S TRYING TO BURY
[1:00:43] YOU. BUT HE FAILS TO REALIZE HE'S ONLY A
[1:00:48] TESTIMONY.
[1:00:50] &gt;&gt; AMEN. He's not destroy.
[1:01:11] &gt;&gt; [applause]
[1:01:14] &gt;&gt; in the face of opposition.
[1:01:16] He said he lost his family.
[1:01:24] He was scraping and BLOOD
[1:01:33] was in a bad Abraham
[1:01:37] could feel the dead
[1:01:39] &gt;&gt; AND THE LEAVING HIS NATURAL BODY STOOP
[1:01:43] SHOULDERS WAS GOING BACK TO THE EARTH.
[1:01:48] &gt;&gt; He didn't feel like praising GOD
[1:01:51] &gt;&gt; ALL THE NEGATIVE THINGS
[1:01:59] &gt;&gt; the worship of a true believer.
[1:02:02] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:02:12] I'm not compromising my
[1:02:15] &gt;&gt; I THINK IT'S STRENGTHEN GOD HELP ME. I
[1:02:18] THINK IT'S THAT WE CAN FIND SCRIPTURE OF
[1:02:21] THIS MAGNITUDE TO LET US KNOW THE
[1:02:24] PROPHET WOULD COME AND TELL US of a
[1:02:26] prayer LINE WHEN GOD CAME DOWN AND SPOKE
[1:02:29] THROUGH HIS VOICE AND HE SAID THIS IS
[1:02:31] NOT WILLIAM BRAND.
[1:02:34] I'M USING HIS VOICE. I'M USING HIS BODY.
[1:02:38] AT THE SAME TIME, HE WAS TELL
[1:02:44] &gt;&gt; lifting your hands. Keeping your feet
[1:02:50] &gt;&gt; don't compromise.
[1:02:59] &gt;&gt; I'm praising God.
[1:03:04] Come on, brother. Come on.
[1:03:06] &gt;&gt; I tell you tonight, forgot I didn't have
[1:03:08] a mic. [panting and gasps]
[1:03:10] They told me a little pale.
[1:03:13] Think so many times,
[1:03:17] how many I lost my place.
[1:03:21] &gt;&gt; How many times
[1:03:23] on a Wednesday or Sunday morning, hell
[1:03:26] comes in all fours?
[1:03:30] If it ain't broken, it is now.
[1:03:32] &gt;&gt; If the car won't start, it won't now.
[1:03:34] &gt;&gt; If you got a flat tire, it will it will
[1:03:36] be then.
[1:03:38] Trouble problem, trials, troubles,
[1:03:41] persecution, family troubles, work
[1:03:44] problems.
[1:03:46] Was he trying to do crack?
[1:03:49] &gt;&gt; Break you to the point of no return.
[1:03:54] But all the time WE HAVE A GOOD SHEPHERD
[1:03:58] that knows everything and all things
[1:04:00] work for the good of THEM THAT LOVE GOD
[1:04:03] ARE CALLED ACCORDING TO HIS PURPOSE.
[1:04:07] And all that dumb devil's done IS
[1:04:10] PLANNING A TESTIMONY.
[1:04:13] &gt;&gt; The doctor SAID YOU WOULD NEVER HAVE IT.
[1:04:16] THE DOCTOR SAID YOU CAN NEVER GET OVER
[1:04:17] IT.
[1:04:19] &gt;&gt; I SAY TONIGHT, GET READY.
[1:04:22] &gt;&gt; Go ahead. Sew some shoes for the baby.
[1:04:25] Go ahead, get some baby clothes. Start
[1:04:28] preparing. Amen. YOU MAY BE CRACKED BY
[1:04:30] THE DOCTOR'S REPORTS, but it ain't his
[1:04:33] last move. The king still has one more
[1:04:36] move.
[1:04:39] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. So, how am I going to do it?
[1:04:42] The worshipper, the worship of a true
[1:04:45] believer in the face of doctor's report
[1:04:47] says, "I don't care what the doctor
[1:04:49] says, I'm healed. I don't care what they
[1:04:54] say. I'm going to see. I DON'T CARE WHAT
[1:04:56] THE DOCTOR SAID. I'M GOING TO HEAR
[1:04:57] AGAIN.
[1:05:00] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. Do you love him?
[1:05:03] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:05:07] I'm not leaving a hook behind. It's the
[1:05:11] worship of the believer that's proven
[1:05:13] his word.
[1:05:16] Look,
[1:05:18] Satan,
[1:05:20] hell was having a ball
[1:05:24] cuz Jesus was on a 4-day journey in
[1:05:26] another direction.
[1:05:29] And they buried Lazarus
[1:05:32] &gt;&gt; and they was having such a good time.
[1:05:35] But when Jesus came by,
[1:05:38] &gt;&gt; lightning struck and thunder sounded.
[1:05:43] And though he was dead four days and the
[1:05:45] skin words was destroying his body,
[1:05:48] &gt;&gt; Jesus said Lazarus,
[1:05:53] &gt;&gt; THEY WAS BURIED. THOUGHT THEY WERE
[1:05:55] DESTROYING THE LAZARUS. THOUGHT THEY WAS
[1:05:57] GOING TO BREAK HOMES. Thought they was
[1:05:59] going to cause confusion. Thought they
[1:06:01] was going to keep PEOPLE FROM GOING TO
[1:06:03] CHURCH. THEY THOUGHT THEY WAS GOING TO
[1:06:04] HAVE FAMILY PROBLEMS AND CHURCH splits
[1:06:10] &gt;&gt; all along.
[1:06:12] They was only planning a testimony.
[1:06:17] &gt;&gt; Lazarus,
[1:06:18] come forth. Oh, there wasn't enough
[1:06:21] grave. There wasn't enough grave clothes
[1:06:23] to hold him. There ain't no grave going
[1:06:25] to hold that body down. [sighs]
[1:06:29] Hallelujah.
[1:06:32] Go ahead and tell the devil tonight.
[1:06:34] You're trying to bury me because the
[1:06:37] science says this. You're trying to bury
[1:06:39] me because my feelings tells me this.
[1:06:42] Telling a preacher,
[1:06:45] a hillbilly preacher, not very good at
[1:06:48] it at all, is telling you tonight that
[1:06:51] God says it ain't over yet.
[1:06:56] &gt;&gt; GOD SAYS WHAT HE MEANT FOR EVIL, I'm
[1:06:59] going to turn it to good.
[1:07:01] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. GOD SAID HE'S TRYING TO
[1:07:04] BREAK YOU, BUT YOU'RE NOT BREAKABLE.
[1:07:07] GOD SAYS HE HE'S TRYING TO BURY YOU, BUT
[1:07:10] HE'S ONLY PLANNING
[1:07:12] &gt;&gt; that I can prove my word and it'll be a
[1:07:15] testimony.
[1:07:18] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:07:20] [sighs]
[1:07:21] [panting]
[1:07:22] Oh, I can go through I got evangelistic
[1:07:24] type message. I told brother Matt in the
[1:07:25] back room,
[1:07:27] but we could go through characters after
[1:07:29] characters in the Bible. They tried
[1:07:33] because two great good men of God
[1:07:36] casting demons out, destroying Satan's
[1:07:39] kingdom
[1:07:40] said, "You know what? Let's catch up
[1:07:43] with them guys. Let's throw them in the
[1:07:45] dark prisons. Let's bury them in the
[1:07:47] prison."
[1:07:50] [sighs]
[1:07:51] They tried to break them. They took
[1:07:54] everything they had around. They took
[1:07:56] their clothes.
[1:07:58] [sighs]
[1:07:58] They took their cell phones.
[1:08:04] They took them away from the family.
[1:08:05] They took them away from the church.
[1:08:08] They put them in chains and shackles and
[1:08:10] put them under the prison.
[1:08:13] They was tormented beyond torment.
[1:08:18] But they they did everything they could
[1:08:20] to to break them.
[1:08:28] But sister Leah about the midnight hour
[1:08:32] about the midnight hour
[1:08:36] &gt;&gt; they thought they go they would break
[1:08:38] through and silence them. The very thing
[1:08:41] that Satan was using to silence them
[1:08:44] became a platform for God.
[1:08:47] &gt;&gt; ABOUT THE MIDNIGHT HOUR ALL HELL THOUGHT
[1:08:51] THEY had them.
[1:08:53] &gt;&gt; Satan was planning a burial.
[1:08:57] Amen.
[1:08:59] &gt;&gt; At midnight,
[1:09:01] HE WAS PLANNING A FUNERAL PROCESSION at
[1:09:04] midnight.
[1:09:06] But God scheduled a revival.
[1:09:10] &gt;&gt; SATAN TRIED TO BEAR THEM, BUT IT WAS
[1:09:13] ONLY PLANNING A TESTIMONY.
[1:09:16] SATAN THOUGHT THE CHANGE WOULD end the
[1:09:18] message, but it only amplified.
[1:09:25] They started a jail house revival.
[1:09:28] What they meant for evil.
[1:09:32] &gt;&gt; They got two men down there. THEY
[1:09:34] STRIPPED THEM OF ALL EARTHLY
[1:09:35] POSSESSIONS. They took their Bibles AWAY
[1:09:38] FROM THEM. THEY TOOK EVERYTHING. THEY
[1:09:40] STRIPPED THEM.
[1:09:43] [sighs]
[1:09:46] OH,
[1:09:48] but there was something down inside of
[1:09:49] them.
[1:09:51] They could break. They could crush them
[1:09:53] and crack their flesh and crack their
[1:09:55] spirits. But there was something down in
[1:09:57] Paul and Silas about the midnight hour.
[1:10:01] It was so dark. Looked like hopes are
[1:10:03] all gone. It looked like the picture
[1:10:06] that stood in the L Satan standing over
[1:10:09] that defeated man. Amen. And the the
[1:10:11] picture says checkmate. Amen. BUT THAT
[1:10:14] THAT OLD MESSENGER BEGIN TO SCREAM,
[1:10:16] "IT'S A LIE.
[1:10:18] &gt;&gt; It's a lie.
[1:10:20] YOU'RE NOT BOUND, PAUL. YOU'RE NOT
[1:10:22] BOUND, SILAS.
[1:10:24] &gt;&gt; Could you imagine?
[1:10:26] &gt;&gt; They couldn't see nothing in front of
[1:10:28] them. Amen. It was so dark. THERE WAS
[1:10:31] NOBODY AROUND THEM. THEY WEREN'T LOOKING
[1:10:33] FOR NO MAN'S PRAISE. They weren't
[1:10:35] looking for no man glory about the
[1:10:37] midnight hour. the worship of a true
[1:10:41] believer
[1:10:43] &gt;&gt; begin TO SCREAM OUT AND THEY BEGIN TO
[1:10:45] PRAISE GOD AND MAGNIFY GOD IN THE FACE
[1:10:50] OF SUCH darkness
[1:10:54] &gt;&gt; and their praise they they put them in
[1:10:57] there to silence them
[1:11:00] &gt;&gt; but it only amplified
[1:11:03] &gt;&gt; a believer's praise
[1:11:05] &gt;&gt; it only amplified it only made it
[1:11:07] greater
[1:11:09] And they they threw two men in to
[1:11:12] silence two messengers.
[1:11:15] And when they begin to praise and they
[1:11:18] begin to worship God, those chains that
[1:11:21] seem to bite them, BEGIN TO DROP
[1:11:24] POWERLESS behind them as they begin to
[1:11:28] praise their Lord. Tell the devil
[1:11:30] tonight, you didn't bury me.
[1:11:33] &gt;&gt; You planned me.
[1:11:35] &gt;&gt; Oh, for such a time as this. AMEN. HE
[1:11:38] BURIED ME TO SILENCE ME AND BREAK ME.
[1:11:40] But the worshipper within them arose
[1:11:45] and a testimony was born. Hallelujah.
[1:11:50] You believe it?
[1:11:53] [sighs]
[1:11:54] You can imagine how much it tormented
[1:11:56] hell. What are they doing?
[1:12:00] I thought I had him. I was throwing
[1:12:02] everything at them. I bound them. Tuck
[1:12:06] their clothes. Tuck their fellowship.
[1:12:08] Tuck everything. What are they doing?
[1:12:10] They're lifting their hands.
[1:12:13] &gt;&gt; THEY'RE PRAISING GOD. THEY DON'T CARE
[1:12:15] WHO'S PREACHING. They don't care who's
[1:12:16] singing. They don't care who their
[1:12:18] neighbor is. The true WORSHIPPER
[1:12:21] WORSHIPS GOD IN SPIRIT. And in truth, he
[1:12:25] magnifies God.
[1:12:30] &gt;&gt; And about the midnight hour, they
[1:12:32] couldn't see it. But it wasn't long,
[1:12:34] church. They began to feel, [gasps]
[1:12:38] they begin to hear the thunder,
[1:12:42] THUNDERING OUT THE POWER OF ALMIGHTY
[1:12:45] GOD. Their praise was so amplified, it
[1:12:49] began to shake the prison.
[1:12:53] &gt;&gt; It began to shake the prison walls.
[1:12:59] &gt;&gt; I say it could happen.
[1:13:02] What Satan
[1:13:04] thought he was doing is changing
[1:13:07] tonight.
[1:13:09] &gt;&gt; Can you see it?
[1:13:11] &gt;&gt; Can you see it?
[1:13:14] Oh,
[1:13:17] the hotel house
[1:13:20] begin to rock.
[1:13:21] &gt;&gt; The hotel house begin to praise.
[1:13:25] The jailers begin to worship.
[1:13:29] [sighs and gasps]
[1:13:30] There was a revival.
[1:13:32] They was preparing for a funeral
[1:13:34] possession. God says, "Oh, just wait a
[1:13:37] minute.
[1:13:37] &gt;&gt; Come on,
[1:13:38] &gt;&gt; Paul. I got this.
[1:13:40] &gt;&gt; Silas, I have this, brother David. Don't
[1:13:43] worry about it. I GOT THIS. I GOT THIS.
[1:13:47] SATAN IS TRYING to crack you. He's
[1:13:50] trying TO CRACK ME TONIGHT. HE'S TRYING
[1:13:52] TO CRACK you tonight. BUT I'VE GOT GOOD
[1:13:55] NEWS. THE king still has one more move.
[1:13:59] And that MOVE IS DECLARED BY THE MESSAGE
[1:14:01] OF THE HOUR THAT YOU CANNOT be broken.
[1:14:06] This ship amen that they CAN BE BATTERED
[1:14:08] BUT IT CAN NEVER be sunken.
[1:14:12] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:14:14] Can I do tell another testimony?
[1:14:17] A testimony was born.
[1:14:20] There's a time we've used this so much.
[1:14:24] There was three Hebrew children
[1:14:28] that was dull in the master's hand.
[1:14:33] They made a decree and these three young
[1:14:36] men decided, I ain't compromising on my
[1:14:39] worship. I'm not compromising on my
[1:14:42] praise.
[1:14:45] And they BEGAN TO GET SO MAD. It made
[1:14:48] hells so mad.
[1:14:53] and they begin TO SCREAM, "I'M TIRED OF
[1:14:56] THESE HOLY ROLLERS.
[1:14:59] &gt;&gt; I'M TIRED [screaming] OF THEIR THEIR
[1:15:01] VICTORY. I'M TIRED OF THEIR SHOUTING.
[1:15:05] &gt;&gt; I'm tired of their praise.
[1:15:07] I'M TIRED OF THESE ACTS 2:38 SCREAMING,
[1:15:10] SHOUTING,
[1:15:12] &gt;&gt; Pentecostal babies.
[1:15:15] That's the only thing the word will
[1:15:16] produce."
[1:15:18] &gt;&gt; He's tired of them. Heat the fire up
[1:15:22] seven times hotter.
[1:15:26] Hallelujah.
[1:15:28] Don't take no chances.
[1:15:31] Hell turn the volume of the heat
[1:15:36] up as hot as it ever been.
[1:15:40] And when those three be children, it
[1:15:42] didn't move them.
[1:15:45] The very man that opened the furnace up,
[1:15:48] it killed him. It didn't move him.
[1:15:52] Oh, church. Do we have some believers?
[1:15:55] &gt;&gt; Oh, they was worshiping.
[1:15:57] &gt;&gt; There was worship of the true believer.
[1:16:00] &gt;&gt; I don't care how hot the trial gets.
[1:16:02] &gt;&gt; I'm going to praise my king. Oh, if we
[1:16:06] could come with THAT ATTITUDE. JOE
[1:16:08] REYNOLDS, IF you could come to church
[1:16:09] with that attitude,
[1:16:12] and I said this before, and I've heard
[1:16:14] many men of God say before, if everybody
[1:16:16] praised God like I did in a church, what
[1:16:18] kind of church service would we have? I
[1:16:21] say outs tonight, Lord, help me get rid
[1:16:24] of my self-centered ways. Brother R was
[1:16:27] said it and WHEN HE WAS OUT there in
[1:16:28] Hurricane Mountain, Lord, help me get
[1:16:31] away from this attitude, this
[1:16:32] self-centered way, and get William
[1:16:35] Brandham out of the way.
[1:16:37] But they just kept walking.
[1:16:40] &gt;&gt; Hell was turning up the fire, the volume
[1:16:43] of the heat. And they just kept walking.
[1:16:48] And they bound their hands. And they
[1:16:51] bound their feet.
[1:16:54] And they dropped them over into the
[1:16:56] fiery furnace heated up seven times
[1:16:58] hotter. And they shut the door.
[1:17:03] The fire didn't touch their hair.
[1:17:07] The fire didn't touch their clothes. The
[1:17:10] fire didn't touch their bodies. Brother
[1:17:13] man was saying like this. Just allowed
[1:17:16] the enough heat
[1:17:19] to do what?
[1:17:21] &gt;&gt; What did the prophet say, brother man?
[1:17:23] To loose them.
[1:17:24] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:17:26] &gt;&gt; He didn't want them not to praise God.
[1:17:29] Amen. And the fire, the heat, the only
[1:17:32] thing the heat did
[1:17:36] &gt;&gt; [snorts]
[1:17:37] &gt;&gt; It only burned off what didn't belong.
[1:17:43] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. THE VERY FIRE THAT THAT
[1:17:47] NEBUCHADNEZZAR CREATED TO DESTROY THOSE
[1:17:51] THREE BELIEVERS.
[1:17:53] ONLY THING IT DID, THEY BURIED THEM. BUT
[1:17:56] IT PLANTED a testimony.
[1:18:00] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:18:02] IT LOOED THEM. WHAT HELL done to
[1:18:06] compromise their worship
[1:18:09] couldn't survive the fire.
[1:18:14] &gt;&gt; THE LATCHES COULDN'T [screaming] SURVIVE
[1:18:16] THE FIRE, but Shadrach could.
[1:18:20] &gt;&gt; Oh, church. There was some loosening
[1:18:23] going on.
[1:18:25] There was some worship of a true
[1:18:27] believer. It wasn't as much as screaming
[1:18:30] and shouting and running. That's just
[1:18:32] the effects of a good revival. But a
[1:18:35] worship of a true believer is walking
[1:18:39] and proving God's word, making God, as I
[1:18:44] read in the first uh quote of the
[1:18:46] evening, amen, that you take God's word
[1:18:51] and he will prove it when you with
[1:18:58] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. And that's what they did.
[1:19:02] I'm not
[1:19:10] &gt;&gt; Oh, what they meant for evil,
[1:19:14] God's turning it for other good.
[1:19:18] For the job, he is out to crack you,
[1:19:20] beat you, bury you.
[1:19:24] Church, we've all been through great
[1:19:26] trials and tribulation and famines and
[1:19:28] grief and sorrow.
[1:19:31] But because you're here standing is the
[1:19:34] evidence it didn't break you.
[1:19:38] &gt;&gt; Unbeliever can be broken, but a believer
[1:19:41] can never be broken.
[1:19:43] &gt;&gt; We came to this world shaped the way we
[1:19:45] are, but we wasn't broken. The real you.
[1:19:50] &gt;&gt; This ain't the real you. This is only
[1:19:52] the tabernacle that the real you is
[1:19:54] using now. A been it laid dormant for so
[1:19:57] long. BUT ONE DAY, AMEN, GOD came
[1:20:00] looking for me. I didn't go looking for
[1:20:02] him. He came looking for me.
[1:20:06] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Could you imagine what kind
[1:20:09] of revival that must have been? They was
[1:20:11] planning the testimony.
[1:20:14] Ain't nothing going to happen till my
[1:20:16] God's done with me.
[1:20:19] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Amen. And when they opened
[1:20:22] the the furnace door,
[1:20:24] there was some praising and there's some
[1:20:27] worship. Didn't we throw three men in
[1:20:29] the fire?
[1:20:31] Oh, devil, what you meant for evil? God
[1:20:34] has turned to good. Hell was preparing a
[1:20:37] funeral, but God was stirring a revival.
[1:20:40] The fire was supposed to end them rolly
[1:20:44] rollers lives.
[1:20:46] But through hell's burial.
[1:20:50] Are [snorts] you hearing me?
[1:20:52] &gt;&gt; You might think the trial you're going
[1:20:53] thing don't mean much, but listen to
[1:20:55] this. Through that burial, a king had to
[1:21:00] confess. A nation had to recognize and a
[1:21:04] decree had to be written.
[1:21:06] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Amen. What they did for
[1:21:09] evil, GOD SAID, "I GOT THIS. THIS IS A
[1:21:13] PREDESTINATED moment in time." Amen.
[1:21:16] Let's take that, LET IT SINK DEEP DOWN
[1:21:18] INTO YOUR RIBS this evening. Let you
[1:21:20] know the trouble that you're going
[1:21:22] through IS SEASONAL. AMEN. This too WILL
[1:21:27] PASS. IT CANNOT break you.
[1:21:32] Hallelujah. It may seem like it in a
[1:21:34] moment. Oh church,
[1:21:39] the fire furn became a platform of
[1:21:43] praise and worship. Tell your enemy
[1:21:45] tonight,
[1:21:47] tell him, "You didn't bury me, you
[1:21:49] planted me.
[1:21:51] What you meant to be a tomb to destroy
[1:21:54] me became a testimony.
[1:21:58] They plotted, they planned, they buried,
[1:22:01] but what you meant for evil, God meant
[1:22:03] for good.
[1:22:06] I should be dead. I should have been
[1:22:08] crazy. I should have been silenced. But
[1:22:12] God said, "What you plan to destroy me,
[1:22:16] God used to develop me."
[1:22:20] &gt;&gt; Oh, that's good. A testimony was born.
[1:22:25] &gt;&gt; I'm the thunder, the evidence. That's
[1:22:27] God's not dead. He's alive.
[1:22:30] &gt;&gt; Cuz evil said I was guilty.
[1:22:33] I'm gonna go ahead and close tonight.
[1:22:36] Evil says I was guilty. Evil said I was
[1:22:39] going to die. Evil said I'd never get
[1:22:41] over it. Evil said I'll carry my past.
[1:22:44] Evil said this, it plotted against me to
[1:22:47] try to break me. Evil said I'm guilty as
[1:22:50] charged,
[1:22:52] but God turned it
[1:22:54] &gt;&gt; and said, "You never done it in the
[1:22:56] first place. Satan has buried us in our
[1:22:59] past, but God turned it. What Satan did
[1:23:03] to bury you is now A TESTIMONY.
[1:23:08] GOD CAN turn a gambler around. GOD CAN
[1:23:11] turn an ADULT AROUND. GOD CAN TURN AN
[1:23:14] alcoholic around. GOD CAN HEAL THE SICK.
[1:23:17] GOD CAN RAISE THE DEAD. GOD can heal the
[1:23:21] deaf. God can heal the blinded eyes.
[1:23:26] &gt;&gt; What hell meant for evil, God is turning
[1:23:30] it for your good.
[1:23:32] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Oh death, where is your
[1:23:35] victory? Oh grave, where is your
[1:23:38] victory? Oh death, where is your sting?
[1:23:42] Hallelujah.
[1:23:47] Oh, we're having a popcorn meeting.
[1:23:51] Turning that yall. Brother Brown said,
[1:23:53] "Take that yall corn, put it in some
[1:23:55] heat." Oh, it can't help himself.
[1:24:01] &gt;&gt; They try to crack it. They try to do
[1:24:02] what they can. They put the heat on it.
[1:24:05] Oh, Sister Destiny can't you can't help
[1:24:07] yourself.
[1:24:09] &gt;&gt; All of a sudden, you begin to hear the
[1:24:11] right song, hear the right word preached
[1:24:14] in the right season. Oh, church. Amen.
[1:24:18] There wasn't enough There wasn't enough
[1:24:20] uh uh uh kings. There weren't enough
[1:24:22] Pharaohs. There wasn't enough
[1:24:24] Nebuchadnezzars. There wasn't enough
[1:24:26] Amen. Uh uh Philistines to stop Samson
[1:24:30] Shamgar. There wasn't ENOUGH GIANT TO
[1:24:33] STOP DAVID.
[1:24:39] &gt;&gt; I was looking at that this weekend. This
[1:24:41] is really off my topic tonight, but I
[1:24:43] was actually looking at where brother
[1:24:45] Brown said David slung uh through that
[1:24:48] stone and the Holy Spirit picked it up
[1:24:51] and sped it up a thousand miles. Not a
[1:24:55] minute, he said a second.
[1:24:59] You know how fast that is?
[1:25:02] That's fast. That's mock speed. That's
[1:25:05] like I forgot what it was. I had it all
[1:25:07] down. I I wasn't going to use it
[1:25:09] tonight, but it was like 0.057
[1:25:12] or something of light speed.
[1:25:16] It could travel around the world
[1:25:20] like seven times.
[1:25:24] And that giant was only like let's say
[1:25:27] maybe 150 feet away from him. Could you
[1:25:30] imagine
[1:25:31] how fast that stone was traveling?
[1:25:36] It wasn't David.
[1:25:39] They was trying to bury David.
[1:25:42] They was only planting a testimony that
[1:25:46] David couldn't do it, but God can.
[1:25:50] &gt;&gt; I can't get over this. They said, "I
[1:25:51] would never be able to have it." They
[1:25:53] said, "I'll never get over it." Oh, they
[1:25:55] don't know the power of my God. Amen. In
[1:25:58] the face of opposition, when the odds
[1:26:01] are stacked against you, if you will let
[1:26:04] it go, God's going to pick it up and
[1:26:07] speed it up a thousand miles per second.
[1:26:12] I say I say, let's go ahead and praise
[1:26:15] him tonight for it.
[1:26:18] I say let the worshippers arise tonight
[1:26:20] and said, "I know I've been battling
[1:26:22] some problems. I've been battling health
[1:26:24] issues. I've been fing a trial,
[1:26:26] temptations."
[1:26:29] &gt;&gt; I say, "So did Job.
[1:26:31] &gt;&gt; But hold on. The king still has one more
[1:26:35] move.
[1:26:36] &gt;&gt; YOU'RE NOT FINISHED. YOU'RE NOT BROKEN.
[1:26:40] &gt;&gt; There's a predestinated bell down inside
[1:26:43] of you that can't be broken. And just
[1:26:46] when you're about to give up,
[1:26:49] Brother Bramble said, "If the musicians
[1:26:50] will come," Brother Bram said, just at
[1:26:52] that moment,
[1:26:54] Job was ready to about give up. Brother
[1:26:56] Mark, all of a sudden, he felt that
[1:27:00] that line that's been running loose.
[1:27:03] &gt;&gt; You know, I read that I about had a
[1:27:05] runaround. I did about have a runaround
[1:27:07] today two or three times because when I
[1:27:10] thought I shared it with brother Matt, I
[1:27:12] actually shared it with brother Amos
[1:27:13] this morning. I text him. I said, "You
[1:27:15] know what? Amen. What Satan has tried to
[1:27:20] compromise my worship with
[1:27:25] can't survive the fire."
[1:27:28] &gt;&gt; And I thought, "Praise the Lord."
[1:27:31] &gt;&gt; What he meant for evil,
[1:27:34] what what the enemy meant FOR EVIL, GOD
[1:27:38] IS TURNING IT FOR YOUR GOOD. THAT IS NOT
[1:27:42] A QUESTION MARK. That's exclamation
[1:27:45] point. God's going to MAKE THIS TRIAL A
[1:27:50] BLESSING.
[1:27:54] &gt;&gt; You might be in a prison. You might be
[1:27:55] in a dungeon. [music] You might be a
[1:27:57] Joseph. You might be a Jacob.
[1:28:02] But down inside of Jacob,
[1:28:06] brother Roy, the scripture said Jacob
[1:28:08] fainted and his his spirit fainted.
[1:28:13] When the brothers came to him said,
[1:28:14] "Joseph is alive."
[1:28:17] This is one of my favorite portions of
[1:28:19] scripture.
[1:28:21] He said, "Joseph's alive."
[1:28:26] And he said his spirit.
[1:28:29] Jacob says, "I can't. I'll never make
[1:28:32] it. I'm too old. My body is worn. I'm
[1:28:36] cracked.
[1:28:41] Brother Morgan.
[1:28:43] But when he began to see
[1:28:46] there was wagons from the king
[1:28:51] waiting on and begin to testify to him,
[1:28:56] Jacob, you're not going to have to make
[1:28:59] this journey alone.
[1:29:01] The king has brought wagons to carry
[1:29:05] you.
[1:29:07] He knew Jacob couldn't ma make it in his
[1:29:10] old age and well stricken. But also the
[1:29:13] scripture says when he seen the wagons
[1:29:17] the spirit of Jacob was revived
[1:29:22] and it said Israel said
[1:29:25] I can make it.
[1:29:28] awoken
[1:29:30] the worshipper within Jacob. Jacob said,
[1:29:34] "There's no way." How many's been there
[1:29:35] before? Amen. We get to the place I
[1:29:38] don't think we can get over this
[1:29:39] situation, can't there's not nothing's
[1:29:42] going to come good out of this
[1:29:43] situation. But a preacher came tonight
[1:29:46] to tell you, don't believe the devil's
[1:29:49] lie. If you are a believer, God's going
[1:29:53] to turn what meant for evil to benefit.
[1:29:56] and is planted a testimony. And a
[1:30:00] testimony has been born to testify a
[1:30:04] thunder, a thunder of a greater power, a
[1:30:08] greater source beyond my ability is
[1:30:12] here.
[1:30:15] Hallelujah.
[1:30:16] And I say
[1:30:19] the same scans,
[1:30:21] they have scanned brother's wife and
[1:30:25] said she has cancer. She's got a tumor.
[1:30:28] Amen. And brother Brown said she he kept
[1:30:30] keeping the size of it. By the time you
[1:30:33] know the spirit of the Lord told him
[1:30:34] said before the doctor's hands touch
[1:30:36] her, it'll be gone.
[1:30:39] Oh, the enemy came in like a flood. She
[1:30:43] still had it. He went to her and felt as
[1:30:45] Sister Tammy said it felt like a
[1:30:47] football
[1:30:49] bulging out of her. Oh,
[1:30:53] Satan tried to crack him. But let me
[1:30:56] tell you something. When she went down
[1:30:59] and the doctor be to take the knives to
[1:31:01] her, brothers and sister, God proved his
[1:31:04] word.
[1:31:07] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:31:08] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. I say he's the same God
[1:31:11] tonight. Doctors can say whatever they
[1:31:14] want to, but let me tell you, write this
[1:31:17] down. Put it on your refrigerator. What
[1:31:20] hell meant for evil, God is turning
[1:31:23] [music] it for your good.
[1:31:26] What Satan tried to bury you with,
[1:31:30] it was only a planning season for you to
[1:31:33] come back to Grace Tabernacle. Said,
[1:31:35] "Brother Matt, can I testify?
[1:31:41] Can I testify?
[1:31:43] You remember when you was preaching that
[1:31:45] Sunday morning and you was and you said,
[1:31:47] "Oh, I don't even know why I'm here. You
[1:31:50] was speaking to my heart. I was
[1:31:52] preaching at brother David Siler several
[1:31:54] months ago while I was on a cruise last
[1:31:56] week. A brother from his church calls
[1:31:58] me. [music] He says, "Brother Joe, you
[1:32:00] remember when you was here, Satan was
[1:32:02] battling me like nothing else." He said
[1:32:05] he was even in the service where he was
[1:32:07] preaching
[1:32:09] But the seed was planted
[1:32:14] not for my glory, for his, for God. And
[1:32:18] he's the same way tonight. You say, "You
[1:32:20] remember when you was preaching that,
[1:32:21] brother Matt? You was right on me."
[1:32:24] Oh, church, let me finish with this.
[1:32:28] Hell has been turned [music] up.
[1:32:31] Hell has been heated up in the hour that
[1:32:34] we're living in. church. Brother Brian
[1:32:36] Archill, my grandchildren time tries
[1:32:39] will have to face things brother Roy me
[1:32:40] and you have never faced. It's evil.
[1:32:44] Men's heart are felling for fear. It's
[1:32:48] just doom and gloom and the can of
[1:32:51] hell's been ripped open. Evil is
[1:32:54] everywhere.
[1:33:00] And brother Matt, when you get on that
[1:33:01] other side
[1:33:04] and you're walking [music] down the
[1:33:05] streets of gold
[1:33:07] and there's going to be soldiers coming
[1:33:11] said, "What age did you live in?"
[1:33:14] I come out of Leosia age.
[1:33:19] You did.
[1:33:22] THAT WAS LIKE THE DARKEST OF DARKEST.
[1:33:25] That was so much evil. How'd you do it?
[1:33:28] &gt;&gt; [snorts]
[1:33:30] &gt;&gt; What hell meant for evil,
[1:33:32] God turned it for good. What he tried to
[1:33:35] bury me.
[1:33:40] I didn't just survive it,
[1:33:44] I overcome it.
[1:33:47] Greater is he that is in me than the he
[1:33:50] that's in the world.
[1:33:53] Hey church, it's evil. a lot of it out
[1:33:55] there,
[1:33:58] but it can't break you. It can't break
[1:34:01] you. Are you hearing it?
[1:34:04] I just believe it with all my heart.
[1:34:06] There's going to be testimonies.
[1:34:09] There's going to be testimonies. [music]
[1:34:11] Hey, we could probably write a book
[1:34:13] already what God has done in Grace
[1:34:16] Tabernacle in seven years. They said it
[1:34:19] was nothing. It would crumble. It would
[1:34:21] never work. It'll never grow. never
[1:34:24] move. It would ne God would never
[1:34:27] orchestrate a work here in Black Rockck.
[1:34:30] But let me tell you what they tried to
[1:34:32] crumble, what they tried to break.
[1:34:35] There's a bell sounded LOUD SAYS GOD'S
[1:34:38] NOT DEAD. HE'S alive and [snorts] he's
[1:34:42] working in the midst of Grace
[1:34:44] Tabernacle.
[1:34:47] Say, "Brother Joe, is there problems?"
[1:34:50] Well, for us humans here, there's
[1:34:52] problems. But you can go to whatever
[1:34:55] church you want to think about. You can
[1:34:57] listen to your greatest preacher. You
[1:34:59] think that he that he's the the lead of
[1:35:02] elite. But let me tell you something.
[1:35:04] He's trapped in humanity just like you
[1:35:07] are.
[1:35:09] If you got humans, you're going to have
[1:35:11] problems. But the beauty of it is the
[1:35:15] beauty of it is we got some Abrahams.
[1:35:20] not going to stagger at the problems,
[1:35:24] but be strong in faith and begin to
[1:35:28] praise our God.
[1:35:30] Why can you praise God tonight when all
[1:35:32] hell is poured out? Because a
[1:35:35] worshipper,
[1:35:37] the worship of a true believer in
[1:35:39] closing
[1:35:42] isn't dictated by trials, famines,
[1:35:47] persecution, droughts,
[1:35:51] hard days, good days, rainy days.
[1:35:56] The worship of a true believer
[1:35:59] is taking God at his word and proving it
[1:36:03] right in the [music] face of opposition.
[1:36:08] &gt;&gt; The king has one more move. He's not
[1:36:12] done with you.
[1:36:14] Hallelujah. Can you stand to your feet
[1:36:16] tonight?
[1:36:19] Hallelujah.
[1:36:22] Let the worshippers [singing]
[1:36:24] arrive.
[1:36:29] Let your sons and your daughters sing.
[1:36:31] [music]
[1:36:36] Oh, just go ahead and surrender your all
[1:36:38] to him tonight
[1:36:42] to the king.
[1:36:48] Let your birds arise. [singing]
[1:36:54] Let your sons and [music] your daughters
[1:36:56] sing.
[1:37:00] Surrender [singing and music]
[1:37:01] in my own.
[1:37:06] I surrender to the king. One more time.
[1:37:13] Worshippers arise. [music]
[1:37:19] Letter shines in your daughter who see
[1:37:22] [music]
[1:37:26] it my all. [music]
[1:37:31] I surrender [singing] to the king. Go
[1:37:34] ahead and play it. Let's just bow our
[1:37:35] hearts for a moment of prayer tonight.
[1:37:40] If Satan has been battling you
[1:37:43] and trying to crack [music] your spirit
[1:37:45] and
[1:37:47] crack your home,
[1:37:49] crack your crack crack your spiritual
[1:37:52] walk,
[1:37:55] trying to bury you in situations,
[1:37:59] bury you in feelings.
[1:38:02] Ah, I said, let the worshippers arise
[1:38:05] tonight.
[1:38:08] God's going to make this trial a
[1:38:10] blessing. What hell meant for evil is
[1:38:14] turning for your good. Can we just pray
[1:38:17] tonight? Lord Jesus, we pray. Lord God,
[1:38:20] they begin to shake those chains tonight
[1:38:23] and begin to lift their hands to praise
[1:38:25] and worship. A testimony is being born.
[1:38:30] A revival has been stirred. what hell
[1:38:34] meant for a funeral possession.
[1:38:37] You was arranging a revival, a jail
[1:38:41] house revival, a barn, a boneyard
[1:38:44] revival.
[1:38:46] What hell was meant for evil, you was
[1:38:49] turning it for good.
[1:38:52] Lord, I pray, Lord God, that you bless
[1:38:54] them, Lord God, that they would take
[1:38:55] this this few moments of encouragement
[1:38:58] by your word tonight and take your word
[1:39:01] and allow you to prove it in their life
[1:39:03] and become a testimony that God's not
[1:39:06] dead. He's very much alive. Bless your
[1:39:09] saints tonight, Lord, in Jesus Christ's
[1:39:12] name.
[1:39:15] Hallelujah,
[1:39:17] brother Matt.
[1:39:20] Let the worshippers arise.
[1:39:27] Let the saints.
[1:39:29] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:39:30] &gt;&gt; Is my lord, [singing]
[1:39:34] [music] my all.
[1:39:39] I [music] surrender [singing] to the
[1:39:41] king.
[1:39:43] Father, I [music] hear it growing
[1:39:45] louder. The song of your greedy. As the
[1:39:50] saints [music] of every nation are
[1:39:53] awakening to sing. From our hearts there
[1:39:57] comes [music] an anthem. Oh, hear the
[1:40:00] praises ring. [singing] This is our
[1:40:02] song. [music] We sing to our king. Let
[1:40:07] the worippers arise. [music]
[1:40:13] Let the sons and daughters [singing]
[1:40:15] sing.
[1:40:16] &gt;&gt; [music]
[1:40:17] &gt;&gt; Yes, my Lord, I'm surrendering my
[1:40:21] [music] all.
[1:40:23] Oh my Lord, I surrender
[1:40:26] [music and singing] to the King.
[1:40:30] Father, I see that you are drawing
[1:40:33] a line in [music] the sand. I want to be
[1:40:37] standing by your side,
[1:40:40] holding your [music and singing] hand.
[1:40:42] Let your kingom come. Let it live in me.
[1:40:48] This is my prayer.
[1:40:51] This is my plea. Let the worshippers
[1:40:55] arise.
[1:41:00] Let the sons [singing and music] and
[1:41:01] daughters sing.
[1:41:05] Oh, I'm [singing]
[1:41:06] surrendering my [music] all.
[1:41:10] Yes, my Lord. I surrender to the king.
[1:41:15] Let the worippers
[1:41:19] over your eyes.
[1:41:21] [music and singing]
[1:41:23] Oh, let the sons and daughters [singing]
[1:41:26] sing.
[1:41:28] Surrendering [music]
[1:41:29] my all.
[1:41:33] I surrender to the king.
[1:41:38] How many give the Lord a hand clap of
[1:41:40] praise tonight?
[1:41:42] &gt;&gt; [applause]
[1:41:42] &gt;&gt; Amen. Through the fire. Through the
[1:41:44] fire.
[1:41:46] &gt;&gt; Amen. What a powerful message tonight in
[1:41:49] the greatest [music] trial of your life.
[1:41:51] There's really a testimony being born.
[1:41:54] But isn't that isn't that just what the
[1:41:55] devil didn't know what was happening?
[1:41:57] [music] Oh, Goliath down there. He told
[1:41:59] David, he said, "What am I, a dog that
[1:42:02] you had come at me with sticks?" Said,
[1:42:04] "But I'll feed your body to the fowls of
[1:42:06] the air and the beast of the field." But
[1:42:08] little did he know that David wasn't
[1:42:10] going to be buried in [music] the valley
[1:42:11] of Elum. But instead in the valley of
[1:42:13] Elum, there was a testimony born.
[1:42:16] [music] Amen. He became a great warrior
[1:42:19] in the middle of the greatest battle. I
[1:42:20] thought, isn't that the Isn't that the
[1:42:22] way our God does? Amen. In the greatest
[1:42:24] trial. What a wonderful message. Now,
[1:42:26] how many enjoyed that tonight? [music]
[1:42:28] Amen. And in the worst trial of your
[1:42:29] life [applause]
[1:42:31] and and what God or what Satan would
[1:42:34] bind you with, he would bind you and put
[1:42:36] you through the fire. And the very thing
[1:42:39] he bound you with couldn't even stand
[1:42:41] the fire
[1:42:42] &gt;&gt; that he put you through. That's the way
[1:42:45] God does, isn't it? Takes what's meant
[1:42:47] for evil and turns it to our good.
[1:42:48] [music] He never fails us. I don't think
[1:42:50] there's anything that goes on in our
[1:42:51] life that God don't allow. Amen. You
[1:42:55] believe that? Every trial. And he said
[1:42:57] he had never put on you more than you
[1:42:58] could bear. So that means we're going to
[1:43:00] make it through the other side. Do you
[1:43:02] love the Lord tonight? Somebody give me
[1:43:04] another hand clap of praise tonight.
[1:43:06] So many times I've questioned
[1:43:10] certain circumstances,
[1:43:13] things I could [singing and music] not
[1:43:15] understand.
[1:43:20] Many times in trials,
[1:43:22] [music and singing]
[1:43:23] weakness blurs my vision.
[1:43:26] My frustration gets so out
[1:43:29] [music and singing] of hand.
[1:43:32] It's when I am reminded
[1:43:34] [singing and music]
[1:43:36] I've never been forsaken.
[1:43:39] I've never had to [music] stand one test
[1:43:42] alone.
[1:43:44] [singing]
[1:43:45] As I look [music] at all the victories,
[1:43:49] the spirit rises up in me. Is through
[1:43:53] the fire. my weaknesses made strong.
[1:43:59] He never promised that the cross
[1:44:02] [singing and music] would not get heavy
[1:44:05] and the hill would not be hard to
[1:44:09] [music]
[1:44:12] he never [singing] offered
[1:44:15] victory [music] without fighting. He
[1:44:18] said, "Help will always come in time."
[1:44:24] You remember [music] when you're
[1:44:26] standing in the valley [singing] of
[1:44:29] decision and the adversary [music]
[1:44:32] says [singing] he
[1:44:36] just hold on [music]
[1:44:39] our Lord will show up and he will take
[1:44:44] you through the fire again.
[1:44:46] [singing and music]
[1:44:50] Many times I've questioned
[1:44:53] many circumstances,
[1:44:56] things in my life [singing]
[1:44:58] I just don't understand.
[1:45:02] There's been many trials,
[1:45:05] so many weaknesses.
[1:45:08] [music]
[1:45:08] &gt;&gt; Then [singing] life's frustration gets
[1:45:11] so out of hand.
[1:45:14] Oh, it's only then
[1:45:18] that he's never forsaken me.
[1:45:20] [music and singing]
[1:45:21] I've never had to stand on test alone.
[1:45:27] And then I [singing] look at all my
[1:45:29] [music] victories and something rises up
[1:45:32] for me. And through the fire, [singing]
[1:45:35] my weakness [music] is made strong. So I
[1:45:39] know
[1:45:41] he never promised [music]
[1:45:43] that the cross would not get heavy
[1:45:45] [singing]
[1:45:46] and the not
[1:45:50] hard to climb.
[1:45:54] He never offered a victory without
[1:45:57] [music and singing]
[1:45:58] fighting. He said help would come in
[1:46:02] [singing] time.
[1:46:05] So remember when you're [music] standing
[1:46:08] in the valley of decision and the
[1:46:12] adversary says give [music and singing]
[1:46:15] in.
[1:46:16] Just hold on.
[1:46:20] Our Lord [music and singing] will show
[1:46:21] up and he will take you through the fire
[1:46:27] again. [music]
[1:46:28] &gt;&gt; [singing]
[1:46:29] &gt;&gt; Oh, I say
[1:46:31] he never promised that the cross would
[1:46:34] not get heavy [music and singing]
[1:46:36] and the hill would not be hard to climb.
[1:46:43] He never offered [music]
[1:46:46] a victory without fighting. He said
[1:46:49] [singing] help would come in time.
[1:46:53] [music]
[1:46:55] So remember when you're [singing]
[1:46:57] standing in the valley of decision and
[1:47:02] the adversary [music]
[1:47:03] says give in [singing]
[1:47:07] justice hold on
[1:47:10] our [music] Lord will show up and he
[1:47:14] will take [singing] you through the fire
[1:47:17] again.
[1:47:19] Oh, just hold [music and singing] on
[1:47:22] for God will show up and he will take
[1:47:27] [singing and music] you through the fire
[1:47:30] again.
[1:47:34] Amen. If you've been through the fire
[1:47:35] tonight, I want you to give the Lord a
[1:47:36] hand clap of praise. You can say,
[1:47:38] "That's my testimony." when I felt like
[1:47:40] giving in and I felt like throwing up my
[1:47:42] hands, but something burnt the chains
[1:47:45] that had me bound and out of my lips
[1:47:48] instead of saying I quit or I give up or
[1:47:50] I'm not going back, but instead out of
[1:47:52] my lips when I wanted to to quit on God,
[1:47:55] something out of my lips said, "But I
[1:47:56] give you glory anyhow. I praise you
[1:47:58] anyhow." Amen. You love the Lord
[1:48:01] tonight. Amen.
[1:48:04] Well, I'm going [music and singing] on
[1:48:06] with Jesus just the same.
[1:48:10] I'm going on [music and singing] with
[1:48:11] Jesus just the same.
[1:48:14] Well, you might false [music] accuse me,
[1:48:17] scandalize my [singing] name, but I'm

[1:48:45] a straight way. It has no crooks and
[1:48:48] bins. But I've got to go on with Jesus
[1:48:51] cuz I know he's my best friend.
[1:48:53] [music and singing]
[1:48:54] When the enemy's all around me, tears of
[1:48:57] sorrow fill my eyes. But I fall down
[1:49:00] [singing and music] on my bending knees,
[1:49:01] but I rise up with a smile. And I'm
[1:49:04] going on [music and singing] with Jesus
[1:49:06] just the same.

[1:49:45] about me when I shout. But there's one
[1:49:48] thing I know. I know what I'm shouting
[1:49:51] about. Cuz I left my sins at Calvary.
[1:49:55] They covered by [music] the blood. I'm

[1:50:43] about us when we shout, but there's
[1:50:46] [music] one thing we know, just what
[1:50:48] we're shouting about. And when Satan

[1:50:53] blocks in my way. But I'm going to stand

[1:51:35] to me in some way. Amen. I appreciate
[1:51:38] the Lord for being so mindful of his
[1:51:41] children. Amen. Just to bring a word.
[1:51:44] Man, that's good. When the devil tries
[1:51:45] to bury you, when you put something in a
[1:51:47] hole and pile dirt on it, Brother
[1:51:49] Morgan, some call it bury, some call it
[1:51:51] planting. You can pile on the dirt. I
[1:51:54] need some soil to grow. Just throw it
[1:51:56] on. Get a shovel. Amen. You love the
[1:51:59] Lord tonight. Let's just bow our heads.

[1:52:07] encouragement, Lord. And just a
[1:52:09] wonderful message our brother preached.
[1:52:11] Lord, what a encouraging word, Lord. And
[1:52:14] God, that no doubt every one of us face
[1:52:17] many great trials in our life, Lord.
[1:52:20] the next time the devil comes at
[1:52:21] somebody, Lord, I just pray they'd
[1:52:24] remember that very words, Lord, that was
[1:52:26] spoke tonight, God, that you would allow
[1:52:29] us to go through trials, Lord. But let a
[1:52:31] testimony be planted in the midst of my
[1:52:34] trial, Lord. We thank you. Pray you'd
[1:52:36] give Brother Joe strength, Lord, [music]
[1:52:38] just open up his heart, Lord. We just
[1:52:40] ask you to go with each one as we go
[1:52:41] from this place. We pray in Jesus
[1:52:44] Christ's name. Amen. Amen. God bless you
[1:52:48] tonight. [music]
[1:53:02] Well, I saw the light. I saw the light
[1:53:08] in darkness.

[1:53:16] inside. Praise [music]
[1:53:18] the Lord. I saw the light. I saw the

[1:53:37] [music] Lord. I saw the lighting
[1:53:44] all the words.

[1:53:55] Praise the Lord. [music]
[1:53:57] I saw the light. I saw the [singing]
[1:54:01] light. I saw the [music] light. No more
[1:54:05] in darkness. No more at night. Now I'm
[1:54:10] so happy. There's no sorrow
[1:54:12] [music and singing] inside. Praise the
[1:54:15] Lord. I saw the light. Well, I wondered
[1:54:19] so aimless. I filled with sin. I
[1:54:24] wouldn't [music and singing] let my dear
[1:54:26] Savior in. Then Jesus, he's came like
[1:54:30] [music] a stranger in the night. Praise
[1:54:34] the Lord. I saw the light. I saw the
[1:54:38] [music and singing] light. I saw the
[1:54:41] light. No more in darkness.
