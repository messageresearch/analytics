to see what the lord has done here this little place in blackrock arkansas that people are gathering from different parts of the states and different churches gathering together to come and and to help dedicate a building that is dedicated to the preaching of the gospel of jesus christ amen i'm certainly honored to be here today and to join my faith and heart and shoulder along with these brethren and brother man for his his courage and endeavoring heart to be able to position himself in a place that he could help the children of god uh that god had called him to minister to uh i have enjoyed these meetings i don't know about you all what a what a tremendous time i've so enjoyed them i've been from thursday night and friday night i figured friday night's best sermon ever heard and then here comes a long saturday night and i think i'm one of those guys that just ever services the best service you know so we but we certainly appreciate these men of god and and what they have labored to put here and and i i'm i'm sorry i just had to thank these girls for this food that's a lot of work and that was really good amen god bless you i i y'all fed a lot of people and and and did it very well and i want to say god bless you but matt you've put on a tremendous meeting here amen your music your ministry the word of god there's a lot of meetings we attend a lot of meetings and i'll say you have put on a tremendous meeting and amen it's been centered around the most important thing that there is uh it's been centered around the word of god amen and and everything that's been done has been done for that purpose amen and this morning we've gathered here for a dedication service amen um i have a few things on my heart we'd like to maybe share with you and preach to you this morning a bit but uh i i want to if i can to turn to the book of romans the 9th chapter to all of you that are in the listening audience online god bless you we certainly welcome you this morning amen and uh we're uh we're gonna have to someday get an amen button for the internet you know so the flashlights or something because amen since especially since this covey had been a lot of people get to watch and amen can't get out and and so uh there was a time that i think we thought there was a curse uh to maybe to stream a little bit i think we've seen the blessing of it by now amen the lord has given us opportunity to be a part of meetings when we can't get there or can't drive across the country amen so we we certainly thank the lord for that and amen and now this morning in romans chapter nine uh we're going to look in verse 33. amen just something here let's look at 32 and 33 and i just want to take our thought from here this morning wherefore because they sought it not by faith but as it were by the works of the law they stumbled at the stumbling stone for as it is written behold a laying sign a stumbling stone and a rock of offense but whosoever believeth on him shall not be ashamed let's bow our hearts father we thank you this morning for this wonderful congregation of people that have gathered in this building and lord we've not gathered here just to fellowship or to see one another but we've come here to honor you and lord we have dedicated our lives to you and to your word of this age and lord we've come together this morning to dedicate a build but father as we stand here today to proclaim things from your word lord we would like to invite you that you would come lord and you would take your word in your scripture the lord that you would establish hearts and lives upon the infallible truths of the word of god and lord the things that maybe would be planned to say that you wouldn't want said i pray you turn this lord father anything you would desire lord to be spoken i just pray that you would put it in our heart lord and that you would have a right away in this building this morning may your children feel the liberty lord to love you and worship you and lord may you you have the right of way in this building and father now as we commit it to you today we ask you to lead us lord do what no man could do speak to hearts lord change lives lord we're asking it in the name of jesus christ we pray amen and amen and may god bless you as you be seated today amen i uh i do want to thank brother matt for the opportunity to speak to you and we just want to uh just to take you off into the scripture here just a little bit and if i speak to you today i'd like to title this a man dedicated to a message dedicated to a message amen and i i i recognize that we are speaking a long dedication but you have to forgive me sometimes i'm not real traditional amen i get something on my heart and then i preach it and ask the lord to come and and to help us all amen but uh i i want to speak to you just a little bit from this one dedicated from a message uh brother uh the brethren have been preaching some tremendous messages and and i i just sat back and chuckled a little bit last night as josh bennett was preaching i thought if he goes just a little further i've got to change my entire sermon uh because he was just he was just working right in an area that was uh where i was uh hoping to be able to take some thoughts from today and uh and in being in that thought was is that this word that you're reading this morning this bible that you're holding or the bible that you believe is not just a history book but yet it is a book of prophecy it's the only book that you have that not only tells you the history but does foretell the future and the thing that we we have the beauty of what what the beauty of the bible is is that we hold it and we have seen uh the very pages of it fulfilled if you if you'd like to notice this because because it's not just a couple hundred year old book then the things that were written we seen written uh hundreds of years before the coming of christ and then when jesus came the bible continually said in the days of jesus he'd done this that it might be fulfilled he done this that it might be fulfilled now the fulfillment of those scriptures did not always match the teaching of the pharisees but the pharisees didn't hold the interpretation of the scripture the messiah held the interpretation of the scripture remember when he stood there in the sanctuary in luke chapter 4 they delivered a book unto him and when he got finished reading the anointing of the lord is upon me to preach he stood and said this day this scripture is fulfilled and who else had the right to really say when that scripture was fulfilled outside of the one that had wrote the scripture and then when the one that had wrote it said this is the thing that i intended for it then that day that scripture was fulfilled in their sight so the bible is plain to say that man he's constantly trying to interpret the word but the bible is of no private interpretation but god makes it live he makes his promise live and when you see the word living then that is the fulfillment of scripture the word alive and and how many places in the bible could we take in hundreds of years things foretold and then comes exactly now one of the great places in the bible that that i if you if you i'm going to skip a part of this because you heard brother josh last night speaking about the prophecies and the and the currency of the scriptures and how beautiful they are but one place uh that i'd like to take from the scripture concerning this matter is in the book of daniel the second chapter i i've been on a little study of daniel chapter two it's a powerful uh powerful area and if you if you'd like to read your bible you can go back to the book of daniel and realize that daniel is basically a book of revelation of the old testament and many of the things that daniel saw was the things that john saw and wrote in the book of revelations amen but they saw it different ways but it was looking at the same things now in the book of daniel the second chapter of course this is a time that when nebuchadnezzar was ruling the entire world as a babylonian king how many knows that nebuchadnezzar the babylonian world ruled in the time of nebuchadnezzar which would have been in the time of daniel and the hebrew children when you read about them israel the nation the jews had been taken into captivity and they were living in babylon under a king who was the ruler of the entire world because god let him be the ruler now when we say the ruler of the world we think today in the seven continents in the entire globe of the earth but the known world in that time was kind of a region what you would think of today maybe as just europe and and the central areas of uh from england over to china up and down to the tops of india that was the known world because they hadn't really crossed the seas and come into america all that part so when you say ruler of the world it was a ruler of that part of the world or the known civilized world during that time and babylon was the ruler there and nebuchadnezzar being the king now nebuchadnezzar having this rule amen of course they probably figured they would rule forever and that this the way would be but now if they had read the prophets like jeremiah jeremiah had already told them amen that their kingdom was going to be short-lived because whenever israel was captured and carried away into babylon amen that you know that jeremiah prophesied that only 70 years would be remaining of babylon until god would deliver the children of israel out of babylon now now i i don't have time to go deep into these things but i'll say this that the children of israel like the hebrew children and daniel them that you read about do you know they were delivered back to the very place that abraham had come out of and because of the failure in israel god allowed them to be carried back through the same trails to babylon that abraham would have left babylon and they were being carried back but watch now amen when they were being carried back they went back differently than abraham left there remember when abraham left there was no nation there was no people who believed in one god amen but when they went back they went back with a revelation of one god amen and of the god of abraham and they went back with that revelation now daniel amen he believed in this one god and and god had been so good to him amen that he stood out above all of his brethren now i don't have time to preach the whole book of daniel so i i'm going to try to just shorten the the thing you'll have to go read it later but but in the scripture here it tells us how that nebuchadnezzar had a great dream the king had a dream and how that dream troubled the king because he he saw some troubling things now there was a lot of wise men in the days of daniel there were a lot of wise men he meant in the time of the king he had he would have had a lot of preachers he would have had a a lot of theologians he had a a lot of people who were set there and they had jobs of of counseling and they were in the king's courts and they would train their whole lives wisdom and things and they knew a lot of things but when the king came to them and said look i've had this dream and i've seen this image and and it's a troubling image and i i want to understand this thing and he asked his uh soothsayers and he asked all the wise men he asked everybody can you can you tell me what the dream is and of course they gave that beautiful answer if you will tell us the dream we will tell you the interpretation thereof well i hate to say this but if you tell me a dream i could give you an interpretation now whether that's right or not where i mean that's yet to figure out now i have to say honestly that there's been a lot of demonology that's used a lot of dreams amen because you tell somebody a dream they'll make that baby come out the way they want you amen they'll make it say what they want it to say so they'll control your life amen and nebuchadnezzar was a wise old king and knew this so he said look god gave me this dream and if you could tell me the dream first and then tell me the interpretation then i'd know truly that your interpretation was right concerning this dream amen and you know what they found out there was nobody could do it they brought in everybody they brought in the most learned the most schooled the biggest the best the most why everybody was brought in and nobody could do it you know what the king said about this he said what good are you anyhow if you can't tell me this then i'll kill every one of you i'll destroy everything everything's gonna that's what he said he said i'm gonna kill you all but then daniel heard what was happening and said wait a minute amen now i hope y'all y'all can read into what i'm saying to you because in malachi 4 the bible said that unless elijah would come everything would be destroyed everything's going to be destroyed unless elijah would come amen because elijah would hold the revelation of what god had intended in the last days amen amen without god giving someone both the vision and the interpretation how would we know right amen but the scripture tells us that daniel stood in the gap for all of them amen for all the preachers for all the denial for everybody everybody lived because daniel stood in the gap for them all i hope you're hearing me amen i'm talking about a prophet standing in the gap for everybody amen the only reason there's any spiritual life left is because god sent the prophet he'll say well i don't believe in the prophet i don't believe in the prophet you got life anyhow whether you believe in it or not you're living off of the benefits of what god has gave to this age in malachi chapter four amen that everybody didn't perish because maybe they didn't like daniel maybe they didn't believe daniel but daniel gave him life anyhow because god gave wisdom unto daniel and he went to the king and he broke it down told the king exactly what he had dreamed can you imagine what that king you you you you from a foreign country you hey many he come on now everybody knew daniel was not of the of the normal bunch he he didn't come out of their schools or nothing but he but he told that dream exactly to the way that nebuchadnezzar had dreamed it and then he turned around and began to tell him the interpretation thereof he began to tell him the dream that you've had o king this is not just another nightmare this isn't just a little thing but this is detailing the kingdoms of the world that will rule during the time of the gentiles can you imagine that a king would have a dream amen and daniel he meant over 2500 years ago would tell the exact dates and times and how the entire world would be revolving and under which kingdoms would rule during those times my goodness to thank this man amen god was showing something to the king and daniel was there to interpret it now in according to scripture in daniel chapter 2 amen that they saw a great a great image now i'm going to give you an image here brother matt could you pull it up i'm going to give you an image here to save me a couple hours of preaching about the image i'm just going to show you a picture that's been drawn of this image and it kind of brings it a little bit to your perspective that's the best way to say it that nebuchadnezzar saw an image amen now the image that he saw is to the left there it's if you'll look at it when daniel begins to break this down in daniel 2 he says the head of gold is nebuchadnezzar which is the battle only empire now i have scriptures on every point i'm making here so if you need to ask a question do it later for me to do this it takes four and a half hours so i'm not gonna i'm just gonna quote it to you if you need the scripture come see me amen babylonian empire is that head the next amen was a see the changing from gold to silver is the median persian empire now it's going to go amen from a more valuable metal to a less valuable metal but it's going to go from a softer metal to a harder metal so this this image is going to devalue itself become harder all the time now watch this the babylonian empire amen then the median empire then the grecian empire then the roman empire and then the divided kingdoms now watch this because amen if you if you're if you'd like to study in the scripture this this nebuchadnezzar now watch this 605 to 539 bc that's 600 years before christ amen the next one is ruling from 539 to 339 to 331 539 i'm sorry to 331 and the next one is in 300 so you're talking about a man showing kingdoms 500 years before they begin daniel is telling nebuchadnezzar that's what his dream is meaning now this now this image is representing the rulership of the world from the time of daniel till the time you're setting right now now if you think god don't know who's going to be can control amen you you've missed the kind of god you serve if you think it's an accident that biden made it on that on that president's office i'm sorry i don't know how he got there cheating whatever happened but god knew he would be there and it's in the plans of god god listen friends amen god's not on zanac this morning wondering who's going to be the rulers god's not here this morning taking nerd pills trying to figure out all of this is going to come to pass god knew exactly who was going to rule and how they were going to rule listen i don't just have to tell you this amen history proves what i'm telling you is the truth if you study history that babylonian empire just a a little while after daniel prophesies this a handwriting comes on the wall and judgment falls on babylon and when judgment falls on babylon there's another kingdom called the medes and persians that are coming in you all know why their medes and persians came in into the time of daniel amen they came for israel's deliverance amen in other words when one kingdom was falling it was falling for another kingdom to come in people say to me all time brother wayne why is it important to preach things like this i'll tell you because this is where we get our hope now listen to me every time a kingdom is going to fall you're going to see a kingdom's going to follow this another kingdom is coming so so the end of one kingdom is the beginning of another kingdom are you hearing me amen and we are now at the end of the world amen the church of the living god there's another kingdom coming it's the kingdom of god we are not going to be left without a kingdom god's kingdom is coming upon this sir amen we are a part of that kingdom by the baptism of the holy ghost we have been brought into the ruling kingdom of the entire world my lord amen babylonian empire media persians greece rome amen now you can go right into your history book whoever heard of alexander the great his kingdom is prophesied by daniel hundreds of years before he's ever even born and when he comes now now there's a beautiful thing here watch this watch this king babylonian is the head of this of this image this image starts at the head and goes to the feet its heaviest part is in the head and it goes to the feet brother ram said which is a proof to the reader that this kingdom will never stand this gentile kingdoms will never stand because it started at the top and came to the bottom but when you go to the stature of the perfect man and when christ begins to build his church he starts at the bottom and goes to the top listen church we are not going backwards the church is not going down but we are rising up in the power of the holy ghost we are not going back to the ages we are going in a rat the church of the living god will be changed higher and higher she'll never fall i prophesy until you as a kingdom it cannot fall as a bride that cannot fall she's been set upon a rock where she cannot fall every kingdom is going to fall but the pride of jesus christ will stand in the middle of it all because it's been prophesied hallelujah people tell me all the time so brother wayne i'll just stick with the bible i don't know if i can believe y'all's message well let's stick with the bible a few minutes and see if this message is in this bible now what you're watching on the left side is you're watching nebuchadnezzar's dream in daniel 2 interpreted by daniel what you're looking at the right side is daniel the seventh chapter when daniel sees the same exact thing but he sees him as beast sometimes you're reading the bible and you read two different three different chapters and you think what's it talking about do you imagine daniel 2 and daniel 7 are talking about the same thing but when you're reading daniel 2 you're reading about an image when you're reading daniel 7 you're reading about beast and you go on daniel 7 it's pretty scary to read about it it talks about lines with wings and amen talks about this this goat with all these horns and it starts getting into these beasts they're in these powers what are they they are rulers of the world the same as four kingdoms so is there four different beasts that represents those kingdoms now y'all see then daniel saw envision what john would see in the book of revelations the 13th chapter when you go to revelation 13 you can pull up the first verse there revelation 13 and verse 1 you will read that john in the book of revelations sees the exact thing they saw but when he sees it he sees it as one kingdom john doesn't see four different things he describes in revelation 13 and 1 he describes these four powers and i stood upon the sea and saw a beast ride us out of the sea having seven heads and ten horns and upon his head was ten crowns and upon his head was the name of blasphemy go to the next verse the second verse amen and he said in the beast which i saw was like it unto a leopard and his feet were the feet of a bear in his mouth the mouth of a lion and the dragon gave him power and his seat in great authority john is describing daniel 7 but he don't see four different kingdoms he sees one kingdom he said preacher what does that mean that means every power that daniel saw has now come into one kingdom it is the roman kingdom according to scripture the last kingdom to rule the world would be wrong now now that's a mystery according to the bible it was a mystery but the mystery has now been revealed and rome is now ruling the world you think the democrats are oh no rome is doing it you think the muslims are oh no rome is ruling rome is ruling the world today people say well brother wayne how in the world can you say wrong there's ruling america and china and russia how is he ruling iran and iran how's he doing it all at the same time well that's the mystery isn't it when you watch these scriptures you see how the median persians gave way to the grecians but then when the grecians gave way to wrong about three about 40 years before 60 years before christ it gave way to rome and rome come in who was rome in italy now you're all familiar with that and that it was a city a country in italy and that country overcame the world rome ruled the world which would be what we think about europe right but the scriptures detail to us amen in revelation 13 and the third verse that that roman empire suffered a wound and looked like it died now if you're if you're studying history you'll see it in europe you'll see rome was ruling the world well until they started capturing all these little countries and you have these kings rising up that didn't want to submit to rome so when they begin to have their own little empires within rome and rome saw what was happening so they divided the kingdom into an eastern and western kingdom to try to keep rule over them amen but it was failing bitterly and rome was losing power until a man named constantine rose up and he took and said i know how to rule i'll do it through christianity and he picked up a cross and pulled together all of those countries and they fought for christianity and the bible tells us that pagan rome was revived and became papa rome which is now the roman catholic church amen and it is ruling the entire world now you say preacher how in the world can rome rule the entire world well the bible said amen that the last kingdom that ruled would be both of iron and clay and if you watch that image when it come to the last kingdom watch it had two legs and one of them was eastern rome the other one was western wrong is that right and on those legs it had ten toes on their feet those ten toes represented ten kingdoms amen that would be in the world in the time of this last image now now i want you to see something amen america don't have a lot of influence in in russia russia don't have a lot of influence in america but the pope has influence in both people say to me all the time they say well how do you believe rome rules the world amen because the iron of rome runs into every government in nations listen to me today people say all the time well it's the protestant churches that have america well let me say something very clearly to you my bible says in the last day that they will form an image unto the beast now the beast itself is rome and the image unto the beasts of protestant denominations and have denominated themselves on the word of god listen to me i don't care what name you call it when a man sets up a denomination he has ruled jesus christ out and he's put himself in we are not following a man do you hear me we are not following a man people say all the time we all follow that man william branham amen listen william branham was a prophet but he had a light that was over his head and that light was jesus christ the pride is not following the man they are following the light even they're following the angel of the lord that was upon his head he would say to me well y'all follow after man well let me let me just put it out there let me help you amen amen what baptist church do you go to come on now remember when we don't follow a man what baptist church do you go to and then tell me who's the order of that church and who makes the rules of that church come on they said well we only we only say what the bible said really why are you baptizing the titles of father son holy ghost because the bible said you should repent be baptized in the name of jesus christ if the bible was your only leader you were baptized the way paul baptized you baptized the way peter baptized why is your women cutting their hair in the denominations if it's the bible we're believing first corinthians 11 chapter said you shouldn't even pray if a woman cuts her hair she ought to repent unto god if she's gonna ah now if we're gonna follow the bible he said that a woman a man that would dress herself like a man is an abomination unto god you know why people are doing it because they're not following the bible they're following a man and that man has led them out of the scripture into his own kingdom and the only king that rules in the last day is rome amen listen to me rome has two churches protestant and catholic can i help y'all amen the devil has two political systems democratic and republican well i'll tell you i'm a republican listen i am a christian and my kingdom is not republican my kingdom is not democratic that is only here to divide you and to divide your homes and divide this country if this country will get under the word of god we can be one unit we can be one party the devil's got two it's protestant and catholic amen it's democratic and republican now i'm gonna i'm gonna get real straight with you for a moment we've had a prophet and he said you watch those three curtains there's an iron curtain he said there's a a a bamboo curtain russia and china he said but there's a purple curtain and that's the one you better watch and we have got our eyes on that bamboo curtain over there our biggest conservative fox news station china china china russia russia russia and they're showing mass in the middle of covet putting mass on fox news and we're elevating them as a conservative voice isn't it horrible when the nation falls so low that a is her conservative voice the bible said the roman churches are and the protestant denomination is a dollar under the same system i said what makes it a i tell you what makes it a they've taken the seed of man instead of the seed of god god is his word god is this bible and anything outside this bible is something death that's the truth said preacher why are you preaching like this because you got your eyes on the wrong curtain you're looking at a bamboo curtain you're looking at communism and the purple curtain has snuck right into the white house i i'm sorry people's arguing all the time now whether or not brother bran's vision about a woman dressed in purple was an actual woman or the catholic church can i shock you it's both a woman represents a church and at the same time a woman standing in purple is anointed as your vice president in america at the same time a roman catholic president sits in the office amen let me get deeper than that you've got nine justices on the supreme court seven of them are roman catholics and people applauded them to get in that office come on who was you pulling for when amy was under attack who was you pulling for amen when when that guy was getting all them taxes he had the whole christian world pulling for him to get in that office do you know what the roman church done to the protestants when we run from europe you know what they've done to us they destroyed everything that wouldn't bow to them and now they're back in power again they're not exercising the power yet but you wait you say preacher you've lost your mind oh no i'm writing the bible and i'm right in the middle of current events rome has taken america without firing one shot is there a higher office than the supreme court is there a higher office than a president do you think they quit being catholic when they took them places no and when it comes to it they are still going to be catholic nothing against the person it's what the bible said would happen we're not saying that to throw away on miss amy or gorbachev whatever their names are that has nothing to do with it i just showed you a picture that said that rome would rule plum to the toes of the image in the last day and here it is exactly what the bible said oh my brother's the church of the living god we are not blind to what's happening we see what's happening that's why we are following a message [Applause] can i can i get just a hair deeper in this amen on the bottom of them feet ten toes isn't there five five toes on each side brother braham said so every foot has a big toe that's the most extended part amen and them big toes it was on that image how many knows what their names were amen eisenhower and gorbachev the owner of the 1960s the eastern world met with the western world and they had a conference amen and khrushchev amen men our eisenhower men iron and kuchov meant clay the very two things that we're going to run into this image met in the east and west together and while they were meeting khrushchev got mad and pulled off his shoe listen to me amen you go on google go google this i mean it's all over the google that khrushchev a russian amen a russian prime minister pulls off his shoe and beats it on the desk now come on now whenever you ever hear about somebody taking their shoe and beating the desk in a political meeting why didn't he beat his hand why didn't he beat his head why did he take his book and throw it in the floor why didn't he kick some staff member he took off his shoe amen because he was representing the feet of the eastern kingdoms that was given there listen that big toe had a name now i saw you see it as a big toe but it was a symbol for a system and that system was being headed up by a man called khrushchev now now you say preacher amen what's this got to do with anything because i want you to see something if the kingdoms of the world can be represented by men amen then the same principle must apply to the other side oh my you say where are you in the world we're in the big toes in the 1960s the big toes amen was named by a prophet had he not named them we wouldn't have knew their name we wouldn't have realized amen that the toes had been exposed the shoe had been taken off the name had been called now we know where they're at oh god church church of the living god amen listen if if you if you like to read your bible in daniel the second chapter it says when the time of these tolls brother brahm said in the time of these kings he said there was something else that took place at the same time how many knows what took place if you keep watching now you come to the end of the gentile kingdoms but daniel kept watching until there was a stone that was hewed out of the mountain come rolling down into babylon if them big toes were represented by khrushchev and eisenhower what's that stone represented by come on church there's a prophet coming into the nations there's a prophet coming in the nation glory to god i'll show it to you in the bible if you want to see it that prophet is representing another kingdom people say to me all time so y'all y'all load heavy upon a prophet now you got to keep your bible handy because amos the third chapter said that god would do nothing until he sends a prophet so you're telling me we're at the end of every world system and god's going to let it surprise the church are you saying that the entire world is about to fall apart and god wouldn't send a prophet when god was moving israel he sent a prophet when god was bringing the message he sent a prophet how about when the whole world is coming to an end god is going to send the prophet and i thank god this morning to know that prophet is not coming we now have the message of the hour the rock has been represented the kingdom of god has been brought [Applause] he said brother wayne you you're getting awful heavy listen let's let's stay with it just a minute and see if we're not at the end of all things what does a prophet mean a prophet means the end of one thing in the beginning of another he's announcing the end of world systems i might as well take a bite out of it i know everybody went around saying brother bran prophesied in 1977 the world would end well he really didn't do that people that read what he said did that because he said i predict and do not prophesy that the world will end in 1977. he said now watch i've heard it preached they said he said it by by divine inspiration amen and and he said by a private student and divine inspiration listen he was not saying by divine inspiration 1977 would be the end that divine inspiration was seven visions he had had and those seven visions were exactly the word but here by looking at the seven visions he was saying i don't know how it could go past 1977. but the world systems did come to an end you say preacher world systems are to an end do you know what it says in the church book that the denominational ages ended with this message how many knows to break the breach brother brahm said it very clearly he said the book cannot be opened till the denominational agents have played out in other words until every denomination has had their say the baptist has had their say presbyterians have had their say but now god is going to speak concerning the word in the last days amen actually actually a good buddy of mine brother tim pruitt preached a message entitled the ending of world systems done it up in canada i can't get the recording but we've talked a bit on it i thought it's pretty amazing go study it sometime the end of world systems amen they end with a message they end with a rock striking the trolls now if you if you if you enjoy bible prophecy how many enjoys bible prophecy amen you can see then amen that this rock that we're talking about must be an important part it must be an important thing to the church now in the 70th week of daniel brother man is going to tell us something now when the prophet says don't miss this don't miss this he comes to a part paragraph 133 he said listen now don't miss this the church age has come from the beginning of reformation luther and the times where the foundation stone was laid which was the doctrine of the apostles amen don't miss this he's going to talk about the rock and immediately he's talking about the church ages now what does the church ages have to do with that stone i think it's a good question isn't it but brother branham tells us this he says listen he said wesley lived out his age and they come into the pentecostal age with the baptism of the holy ghost is shaping up remember the headstone wasn't on it yet they shaped the church exactly like the pyramid to fit their headstone but the headstone never did come look what he's saying the headstone never come in the church agent it never made it that far it was growing up but not that far then he says to this later in the same paragraph he said they rejected that stone that pyramid they cut it out of the mountain without hands and do you see it the rejected one the rejected stone is the headstone the capstone and the very one they rejected through the gentile ages christ and christ was not cut and put here as a viker or son of god or some dignitary in the church he's the holy spirit the cap of the pyramid will be christ's coming now watch this we we we i think this should be a foregone conclusion in the church by now we believe in a corporal body of jesus we all on the same point aren't we we believe in a corporal body one day this bride will be translated to meet that body let's get this out of the way so you can understand amen that body will not actually be seen in this dimension until the millennium but something has to take you to that body something carries you there so when he speaks of headship or he speaks of the ministry of christ today he's not speaking of the corporal body because if the corporal body was here that would be the end of everything would be no more preaching there would be no more salvation right so he's talking about the ministry of christ as the son of man in the church now it's been shaped up like a pyramid and daniel said he watched the gentile until the stone come out of the mountain he had never put a capstone on the pyramid yet watch this now he said what happened at that time later in the paragraph it was the coming of that stone it went to the church in glory at the rapture so at the time of the rapture this stone is to appear in the church of the living god we got another picture here of a pyramid can you bring this up now i'm going to show you another picture to save me a bunch of talking amen now right here is a picture of another statue this is the statue that ii peter describes that brother branham preaches a message the statue of the perfect man and represents the church ages of the gentile as a statue of the people so to be like jesus he's sitting saying have a beard long hair and roll a robe and ma no he was talking about the nature that was in christ which is described as faith and virtue and knowledge and temperance of patience and godless brotherly kindness now the thing you've got to remember is not one time in the bible does it say god is faith or god is virtue or goddess knowledge or god is temperance it don't say that temperance comes from god knowledge comes from god but god is not that amen but when it comes to love john says god is love then what you're watching then is the building up of a church unto the place of christ himself coming into the church how many knows this is token age brother random represented that as the token of the church or the true baptism of the holy ghost not azusa but the christ himself that was to come into the church in the last days now i don't want to lose you here i want to show you that that that pyramid that cap upon the top is the headstone or the stone of grace that was coming to the church on the last day do y'all see there's a gap between them two amen somebody had to get that gap somebody had to make the gap somebody had to stand between the living and the dead somebody had to pull together christ and his church somebody had to take the feminine and the male and put them together in a marriage no church could do it no denomination could do it nobody could count the bride amen but there had to be a prophet to introduce christ to the age that we're living in he stood in that gap and brought that headstone amen which is the holy ghost now now and now we're not we're not a gazillion miles out here because if you go back to the book of daniel you'll see when daniel's people were released from babylon they went back to jerusalem after 70 years you know what they went back for for restored worship they went back to their homeland where they were going to build a temple come on church i'm talking to you they were going to build a church they were going to be able to temple and this temple was going to have someone who could design it to be just like the original temple people had been gone 70 years there was no stones left there was no but there was nothing on the ground that could detail what a church or to look like but god according to the bible prophesied that jerubal a prince among them would bring them back to a restored church oh god now that's zerubbabel amen according to the bible is a man who was in the book of zechariah now now you may wonder brother by the way what does this have to do with your sermon dedicated to a message well zerubbabel in the bible was a man who was going to lead them into a complete building of a church or of a temple to restore the order of the worship now that seems like that would be hundreds and thousands of years removed from where we're sitting now but in a message of grace in 1960 william branham comes along and takes this as a text in zechariah 4 and he says that the lord he said we'll do this not by might not my power but by my spirit saith the lord he promised that his spirit would rebuild the church to its original condition and the spirit that was there would stir up a man named jerubal and make him rebuild that tabernacle or that temple now notice here in the message of grace in 1961 brother graham said there's a removable has laid it and he said i want you to notice this saints are uber will put on the headstone not a corner a head now you will put on a headstone now notice because this messenger zerubbabel in the old testament is only representing the seventh church-aged messenger who would come according to revelations three and who would restore the order of the church back to its original worship and what god intended it for it to be now i want you to hear me i want you to catch what i'm saying to you because he was going to bring forth a headstone do you know what zerubbabel was going to say when he brought that headstone when that headstone was to be put on the church you know what he was going to say as the head started sitting on the church he was going to cry grace grace come on come on church you had a place at the table you had a seat of grace but somebody had to come and find you something came looking for you it was a message where would you be if the message hadn't come where would you be this morning if this message hadn't come to your life and i can say to you this morning grace grace grace unto the headstone of god what's he going to do he's going to come crying grace grace under this headstone look what he's doing he's bringing forth a ministry of jesus christ he's bringing the headstone to the church now if you're uh i'll take just a moment to take it here being with this this far are you all okay everybody okay and now i want you to see something zerubbabel was to bring the headstone we agree with that zerubbabel now our day is a man named william branham william branham is not the headstone william branham is aruba paul and he's bringing the headstone come on val if you'd like to read your bible zerubbabel was with a man named joshua when they built that temple you know what joshua is jehovah savior come on amen it's jesus which was derivable in there in the bible in the bible there were two distinct men you could see them the rebel and jesus it's a rebel and a man named joshua you could see them building two men building but in the last days the prophecy is that jesus will return as a spirit and that spirit will be in this church come on i'm on prophecy you know i am a little while the world see me no more but you shall see me for i will be with you even in you until the end of the age so people see this man william branham doing the works of god doing the works of christ and they look and say who is it he says it's not me i'm the cerumable but there's another one on the inside and he is doing the works come on church the church ain't finished until christ comes into the body you're not finished till the holy ghost comes on the stone what's this preacher doing he's finishing things he's restoring the order if you like to go to the to the book of revelations the fifth chapter there's a ministry in the fifth chapter of the book of revelations everything's lost john's crying remember malachi 4 everything's lost remember daniel 2 everything's dying unless somebody can tell us what this means in revelations 5 john is weeping because nobody is worthy to open this book but there's one in the middle of revelations 5 that stops john's weeping who's john come on now who's john don't weep john there is one there is one that has prevailed to take the book john don't weep john oh god there's somebody that can open this or somebody that can bring the word of god now so the world reads this and they look for jesus to come walking out to a platform and just start preaching to them because then they'll know it's the lord speaking right but scripture blocks him from doing it it said god will not do that unless he speaks through a prophet now if you go to the breach in 1963 man he's standing in that gap that breach is a prophet and he's standing between the unseen realm and the singing realm and he's bringing something to the people that they have not understood prior to this time he has literally watched what's happening he's inviting the one that's worthy to come and open the lamb's book of life that's been healed from the foundations of the world he is asking him to bring forth the title deed redemption unto the entire earth listen we're about to have a millennium the church is about to rule the earth but before they can rule the earth the names of the rulers have to be revealed from the beginning before the foundation of the world now when the prophet comes forth the bible st the prophet tell i love i love listening to the breach i'd love to hear it i can kind of take you can i just preach to you man i'll take you to the breach brother is preaching along i'm listening i love to listen and i'm sitting here listening and brother brahma is talking about this angel and this elder and how he's talking and the book of being open he said then then they begin to sing hallelujah and praise me to god now if you go listen to the tape at the same time brother braham says this the church he's preaching to breaks out in hallelujahs and pray about shouting down actually just like the scripture it's literally happening look the one standing in the platform brother brown says something that'll it'll just amaze you he said now let him that's worthy come forward now or forever hold his peace so what he's doing is he's bringing forth the one that can open that book amen that can reveal what's inside those seals now now you may not see the importance in this but i want you to catch the importance of this because if you can see the source of what you're believing you can see the amount of authority it's going to have what's the authority of this word you're speaking goes clean to the throne of god now watch what he does because when he does he invites one to come now the prophet is going to declare amen he is here again he's going to say that my ministry is to declare that he is here now that's pretty powerful stuff to me as an individual he's declaring that he is here but the man will declare it again he'll say headship is here the head of the body is on the earth who's the head of this body it's christ now i know there's been a lot of things preached through the years but let's take scripture paul said jesus is the head of the body but every woman is the head of her every man is the head of a husband and christ is the head of every man i'm not going deeper in that that's enough plain is that plain who's the head then christ and who's introducing that headship a prophet so he's elevating christ above your teaching above your church's teaching above the pope is teaching he's elevating this bible above every teacher in the world what's he doing he's ending their teachings he's ending their doctrines he's settling the matter you won't wonder about predestination anymore you won't wonder about baptism anymore what's he doing the axe is being laid to the root of the tree now zechariah 4 amen if you pull this up zechariah 4 the scripture tells us amen that this is amen what zerubbabel has said i'll show you in the bible zechariah 4 and 6 he said he answered and spake unto me said this is the word of lord under zerubbabel saying not by might not by power but by my spirit by can you say it with me my spirit okay so the capstone's going to be what by my spirit well by the way we're looking for the corporal body to come on the church so we can have a by my spirit come on church you want to see it again go in the token exodus 12. what's happening god is bringing judgment upon egypt but at the same hour judgment is falling on egypt there is a group of people who have come under the covenant of a token by a pillar of fire by a prophet and by the blood of the lamb the corporal bodies in the house the lamb is not being seen but the life is on display what is the church the life of jesus christ in every aspect except for the corporal body he is the same yesterday today and forever that same jesus is right here in the building this morning [Music] not by my but by my now we're getting somewhere second corinthians 3 watch paul he teaches it clearly he said now this now the lord is that spirit and where the spirit of the lord is there is liberty liberty from every denomination liberty from every man made teaching liberty from every kingdom that nebuchadnezzar saw you are the first church in the entire ages that have left the ages and brought liberty upon the church glory to god come on champion well by the way you saying layout to see has ended you know let's just send that question right here i'm a little sick of that question by now william branham is laodicea over no it's not ended it will end in tribulation if you think i said differently he said you misunderstood me that is a settled matter what am i talking about laodicea represents egypt but goshen is the pride and when judgment's on laodicea there's a pride standing under the token word of the baptism of the holy ghost we've got live negotiation hallelujah we've got a lot in goshen you think i've lost my mind i've not lost my mind the bible said where the spirit of the lord is we're the spirit that's jerubal brought to the church is it will be liberty from ever teaching liberty from every every apostle liberty from every man-made system had come upon the earth i'll tell you what this message will do it'll destroy every bit of it people get caught under traditions and i know what they are and they intermingle themselves with you with family traditions well glory we might as well preach since we're here i got to thank him one day i might make a little gold i found out gold don't come from the earth it come from the heavens i think it's illegal to do it anyhow but i was thinking i was thinking there got to be a way to make this stuff but father feather study tells you that gold comes from fallen stars the stars fell into the earth and the gold was deposited from their fall and they mingled into the earth that's why when you pull them out of the earth there is pyrite and there's iron and there's crystals and everything's in them that's why a prophet said something had to beat the gold until all that other stuff is out of it come on church and christ has sent a message to beat out every family tradition to beat out every idea of man come on you were in the heavens to begin with but a foul brought you into the air come on and your family traditions been mingled into you but god don't want your family tradition he wants the gold that he put in you from the foundation of the world it's time for you to focus it's time for you to focus i know what your last name is but i want to know what your first name should have been should you have been miss jesus christ to begin with well brother wayne i've got these faults and i know who you are some people sitting in here hey man knew me from time i was in diapers but you focusing on the wrong guy because there's another guy in there by the baptism of the holy ghost a gc that come from almighty god and i've been through some rough patches and i've been through some troubles in my life but every one of them was only separating the humanity from the deity that god could use us for what he decided to use us for there's got to be a separation in it and here is a stone to beat the gold into the image of itself the spirit of the lord where it's at there'll be a liberty oh god can we stay there the lord is that spirit can you say it with me the lord so let's catch zechariah 4 by my spirit ii corinthians says the lord is that spirit but in first thessalonians 4 it said the lord that spirit himself would descend from heaven oh church the lord himself is going to descend from heaven that's why we don't need your personality amen isn't it beautiful amen that we're not here following a personality this morning we're not here after a personality or a building or how it looks or what it is amen we have dedicated our lives to a message it's not the personality of a pastor or a preacher or an evangelist there is only one person that's important in the house of god that person is christ jesus our lord he is not the second person of the godhead he's not the third person of some godhead he is god alone and there is none outside him we are not a bunch of pagans to believe in the multiplicity of gods there is one god he is our lord jesus christ and he is descending into this earth by the baptism of the holy ghost don't bring that trinitarian stuff to me because you're going to john 14 and you'll say watch jesus said the father right the father will not leave you comforted so he send another sound like two or three there don't it we'll just keep reading though the bible doesn't contradict itself the scripture continues to say i will not leave you comfortless but i will come unto you and be in you even until the end of the world so is there three or is there one [Applause] there is only one lord there is only one god and his name is jesus christ he is the king of all the kings he is the lord of all lord and he has risen up this evening and he sits on the right hand of our father in power trinitarians have twisted every doctrine they'll take that right hand of power and make two seats up there well let me tell you jesus and all power and heaven and earth has given unto me that power that was put into him is accessible today by the baptism of the holy ghost to every believer in this building now i don't want you to think i'm crazy but the lord himself shall descend from heaven now you might think when he brings forth the headstone crying shouting grace grace there's an actual rock but the prophet and the message of grace said when he unfolds this mystery i'll cry grace when he unfolds them seals i'll cry so a prophet he was not bringing a rock to the pulpit he was bringing a revelation he was bringing revelation i don't know what it does he was bringing a revelation is that yours hallelujah mercy oh i feel good mercy man you had me you had me going i almost stole your seat the other night is the hanky sorry had me going josh i wanted to take that seat when he when he had paul on one side brother branham on the other the only thing i could think is i'm at the wrong table somebody somebody put me at the wrong table but i'll take it see he said i'll unfold this mystery so he's bringing a revelation now i i want you to see something the stone that daniel seen is not granted it's not granted how many knows that trees represent men in the bible i mean those stones represent men in the bible now watch this because in second in first peter he says to whom a living stone disallowed men and chosen of god precious and two and five you also lively stones built up as a spiritual house a holy priesthood to offer spiritual sacrifices acceptably god by christ we're for also is contained in the scripture behold i lay in zion a chief cornerstone elect precious he that believeth upon him shall not be confounded it's not a granite the bible said it's a person looking look at the scripture the stone which the builders disallowed is made the head of the corner the seventh verse in the eighth verse it's a stone of stumbling a rock of offense even in them which stumble at the word being disobedient were unto they also were appointed now let's use another one it's a spiritual rock according to paul he says that did drink of the same spiritual rock they drink of the rock they follow them that rock was christ according to the book of luke amen if this rock fell on you it would break you to pieces but if you fell on it you would be broken well it's up to you which way you want that to end in acts chapter 4 again for for time i'll not read it but i'll give you the scripture acts chapter 4 again amen the stone is the head amen in romans 9 paul prophesies and said wherefore because they sought it not by faith as it were by the works of the law they stumbled at the stumbling stone and it is written behold i lay in zion a stumbling stone and rock of offense whosoever believeth upon him shall not be ashamed now that just sounds like a scripture in the book of romans that is totally abstract from who you are but how many knows the importance of that scripture to this church [Music] this is the scripture your church is built on do you know that when brother branham in 1962 in the fall his ministry was changing it's going to take me a minute so y'all forgive me but i feel compelled to say this to you his ministry was changing and he was moving from a second pull to a third pull of his ministry he was moving he meant from the prophecies he meant of just divine healing and he was moving into being a word prophet and in the fall of 1962 he sees a vision of angels coming and he actually thinks it's his death he thinks he's about to die and he makes a prayer and said lord if this is the end of my ministry if this is my death let me die he said but if it's not give me a consolation teach me show me he said about a half hour later i woke up in the corner and i had my bible open to a scripture romans the 9th chapter and the 32nd and 33rd verse so those angels coming to brother branham have you heard the story the room talks about angels coming to him i want to see your hands so i wanna know where you are amen you've heard the story of how seven angels came to him out in tucson there but before they came to him in tucson six months prior he tells on tape a vision of seeing them coming to him and he's asking what does this them coming to me mean and god answers what the coming of them means it means a stone will be laid in zion come on cerumable he's bringing the stone he's not bringing a piece of granite he's introducing the person of the word back to the church that's the very bridegroom of the church in the last days now look what he's doing he comes to himself in the corner and he says he says oh i've come to myself reading the scripture in romans the ninth chapter now it's a beautiful thing because now he has a vision that's in romans chapter 9 a stone i want you to stay with me a stone now is in revelations the 10th chapter with an angel coming with a message the stone of daniel 2 is now transferred to revelations 10 as a prophet coming with a message so romans 9 now puts you in revelations 10. let's read revelation 10. and i saw another mighty angel come down from heaven clothed with a cloud and a rainbow was upon his head his face as it were the sun his feet as the pillars of fire now look at this he had in his hand a little book and he set his right foot upon the land left foot upon the earth the first verse there tells you that when he saw him he was wearing a cloud he was clove with a cloud and a rainbow was upon his head do you know this scripture is actually going to be fulfilled right just northeast of tucson arizona in 1963 in the end of february can you pull up the picture when you when you see this william branham prophesies six months later he meets seven angels and they form a wig around the face of jesus christ now if you see that picture if you see it a little closer you can look right in that into the into that picture you'll see the eyes the beard the nose we can show it to you a little better in a picture but you can see the face of jesus christ now you you say a cloud the bible said it was a cloud he was clothed with a cloud and seven angels were his wig the wig of this man is seven angels now you say where why in the world was this why does this look like this do you know that john saw this very cloud in revelation chapter one how many knows it in revelation the first chapter you can go read it and john said i saw him he said i saw him with a hair like wool and a face like fire that he did not say it and his feet were his brass and he gives you seven symbols of the judgment of jesus christ coming upon the earth oh church now when john sees it in revelations 1 he sees it as a judge what's that stone in daniel 2 supposed to be the judgment of the earth and he sees this cloud a prophet sees this cloud in revelations one and brother branham takes this very picture and says it is exactly what john saw in revelations the first chapter it's exactly what happened in revelations the 10th chapter now why are you why are you spending time here let me show you something if you look in this in this cloud you'll see that when you look at the face of jesus he's actually looking to the right now the prophet said watch this he's looking to the right exactly like he did at calvary at calvary jesus was hanging between two things one on the left and one was on the right the thief on the left was coming to his judgment but he was looking to the right where there was a center hanging there that thief on his right i hope you're hearing me was the last seed of the old testament he was the very last one to come in and he was hanging on the cross he couldn't repent he couldn't be baptized he couldn't do the works he couldn't put up you know what he did he accepted he accepted jesus christ he said lord remember me grace grace not what i've done what i accepted david when he accepted him jesus said tomorrow you'll be with me and my kingdom you'll be with me and my kingdom what you have accepted has exalted you from a thief from a robber from a murderer and the voice of one has elevated you to a position i can't hardly preach i want you to know brother random said something about that thief on the right that'll just blow your mind he said that boy had lived his whole life he said he never thought about god even one time not even one time had he ever thought i already get saved how hard to get right but the power of what he was hanging beside the power of what he was standing beside was the power of all the ages he was hanging next to not the third person of a godhead that wasn't just another man that was the king that was a sovereign king with a sovereign grace and pardoned him [Applause] the head bringing grace the last ones coming in at the time of judgment when the whole world is under judgment but this message is not a message of judgment it is a message of grace it is part of you it has taken you from every lie it has taken you from every sin it's brought you out of every ungodliness and it's given you a victory there's nothing that can do it nobody's church can pardon you no lutheran church no pentecostal church but this message is the head [Applause] i wish i had the voice over ten angels right now amen to prophesy to you you have received your sign you have received the word that can change your entire life look at this he brought it right down there now you're gonna you're gonna think i'm a nut but i want you to watch the scriptures in daniel 2 that stone became romans 9 which is wrong revelations the 10th chapter the opening of that book do you know that white wig one who's in revelations 10 who's in revelations 1 is also in daniel 7. in daniel 7 it's prophesied there is one called the ancient of days william branham takes this picture and said this is the ancient of days of daniel the seventh chapter anybody know what he did in daniel 7 he come to the end of them four beasts and when he got to the end of their powers he gave the kingdom unto the saints of the most high the one that can give you the kingdom is upon the earth the one that can give you a ministry is here the one that can give you a grace is here it was the ancient of days he brought a dominion to the church now you've heard it said that you have been lifted into heavenly places but it has never been fulfilled until this hour in the church angels could not bring you this high hey my church listen to me leon decear can't bring you this high but it would take a message it would take a grace from god that would lift you above every denomination man can only take you so high but this is the wings of an eagle and it's taking you beyond your family it's taking you beyond your understanding beyond your tradition oh god he ain't looking for a buggy driver he's looking for an eagle he's looking for a son of god my brother being back there he said to me last night i come from the buggy amen behold he's moved he moved from a buggy to a car to an airplane and now he's sitting on an astronaut today and he's went higher than any lutheran can take him how to determine he's went into the mind of god that is before the world ever began headship is the mind of god why could a prophet stand there amen in a denomination you can't do this but brother brandon could say you never did it in the first place where is the first place it's in the mind of god and here's the prophet bringing the mind of god back to the church where you never were a sinner where you never had a problem well you never were amen just another church member you were always a son in revelation 13 this beast comes crawling out of the sea brother said wrong coming from the peoples of the world a little later in revelation 13 8-9 you'll see that that same beast power as an image comes crawling out of the land it's america an image under the beast so the beast that daniel saw is crawling out of the land crawling out of the sea every system in the world is infested by wrong but here comes one down out of heaven and he takes one foot and puts it on the land and he takes another and puts it on the sea and every system is now subject to the word of god in the age listen to me i don't have to ask no baptist church if i can preach this i don't have to ask no lutheran if i can preach this amen this is the headship of christ coming back upon the church there's nothing above it there's no word higher it's a preacher why in a world why in the world would you go this far people say to me all the time they say well hey man this might have happened in another age you know that's why i love about the bible god so tied this up that you can't misplace it if you believe the bible daniel saw what what john saw y'all believe that in daniel 12 what did the bible say daniel seal up this book until when till the ten toes seal it up until the end time and in the end knowledge shall increase and the righteous shall shine as the permanence of the heavens you'll be lifted from the sands and the dirt and the dust and be placed into the stars where you originally were sons and daughters of god there is coming a message under the opening of the book and i'll put a son of god where he belongs it'll place him back in the heavens in the mind of god you didn't you didn't you didn't belong in that bar room you didn't believe long in that tavern you didn't live in that whorehouse you didn't believe in that crack house that's not where you come from that's not your origin you come from god but here's a message that'll put you back where you come from the blood is for the redeemed this blood ain't for everybody this bloody for everything is for those sons that were born before the foundations of the world it's here to put you back when's it going to happen brother in the end in the end this day in daniel chapter 10 amen excuse me in revelation chapter 10 almighty angel coming out of heaven what's it say he has a book open so daniel 12's book is open in revelations 10. and john wanted to write it it was such a good message it was such a powerful thing john wanted to can you listen to me folks can you imagine john seeing even the symbols of what i'm preaching right now and he couldn't tell it he had to seal it up he had to seal the thing and and the thing we're wondering is how long we're going to seal it how long will it last now according to your bible in daniel in revelation chapter 10 and the seventh verse pulled it up revelation chapter 10 and seven it tells us when the book would be unsealed daniel 12's book will be unsealed sometime in the future from daniel and he predicted it would be at the end time but in the days of the voice of the seventh angel when he shall begin to sound the mystery of god would be finished as declared to his servants the prophets in the voice of the seventh seventh angel come on now so if you're counting one two three four five six seven that gets us laodicea so who's the messenger of laodicea will be the same angel that would declare the mysteries that was healed in daniel chapter 12. now look at the beauty of this because if you if you watch the bible it'll tell you story after story i'm not going to preach all day now hold you hold your peace revelation chapter 22 what what's this now revelation chapter 22 if you go if you go in revelation chapter 22 it's the end of the bible and you go on the ninth verse now watch what happens in revelation 22 verse 8 we'll start in the eight and i john saw these things and heard them as i seen who's john i john saw these things heard them and when i'd heard them seeing these things fell down to worship before the feet of the angel which showed me these things john set into worshiping the angel that was showing the revelation which many men have got caught up in but the angel said unto me don't do that well that's good ain't it hallelujah you could shout all the way home with that one don't do that for i am thy fellow servant so he's not a celestial angel after all he's a fellow servant and of the brethren a prophet so this seventh angel is also a prophet look at what he says he says keep the sayings of the book and worship god william branham is saying to you stay with the scripture and worship god stay with the scripture and worship god look at what he does amen look look in the 10th chapter what's john told by the angel seal it up until what seventh angel what's the tenth verse he sayeth unto me seal not the saints so the seventh angel is the one dealing with john in this verse it's not time to seal it it's time to preach it listen to me it's time for the thunders to thunder it's time for the message to be preached it's time to take the gloves off and preach the power of the son of man back in the church of the living god we're not here a bunch of little kids want to pat you around this morning and hold back with me in this word listen to me you want to talk about being a real mature church let me talk to you about maturity job where were you before the foundations of the world i'm going to talk to you like a man where were you when god was laying the corners of the earth job i tell you where he was he was in god and now the bride has the answer god asks joe we're not asking the question we have the answer we were there we were in the mind of god it's time to unseal it time for the thunders to thunder now just really really really nicely let's say what those thunders are they are the voice that reveals the mystery of what has been a symbol to its reality a white horse is the ministry of the devil you with me the red horse was the persecution of the church amen the thunders reveal the mystery of what it is then the bride was only a symbol in the bible but thunder the thunder now the pride is not coming she's here i'll build my church upon a rock this is the church of the living god i can announce it by a prophet you are the virtuous sinless pride [Applause] you know what that means it's not coming it's here i don't need archbishop so and so i call this the bride i don't need a certain denomination to pat it on the head and say master the bride as long as you're under the word of the age it's a prophet and he's announcing to you there's no higher government has no higher praise has no higher seal god himself is sealing the church with a message who are you show them the token and you'll know what's going on here prophesy for the time is at hand for the time is at hand now let me show you the very next verse he that is unjust let him be unjust steel he that is filthy let him be filthy still and he that is righteous let him be righteous still and he that is holy let him be holy still sounds like judgment don't he can i say something to you his message did not come to condemn you but it did come to judge you we say come to judge but not condemn absolutely can i put it to you in nature if you plant corn in a field and the sun rises it's not condemning the corn it's judging it it makes the corn produce what it is and this message will make you be what you are if you were a gene to begin with and this message comes across your life i won't have to beg you to come to the house of god i won't have to beg you to believe the things of god this message will ignite the seed of faith on the inside of you and the right cry shut up in the power of god you ain't gonna have a lot of creeds if you've got this message strike the people with a message if the soul is from god you know a lot of blades of fire you can't put it out come on y'all tell me amen after jesus met the woman at the well who run her down told her how to live who run her down told her when to come to church the bible said she dropped her water pot and ran into the city and many were converted because of her testimony she was like a house of fire on a windy day how would you stop her she had seen the messiah let me say to you i have seen the presence of god in my generation you can't stop it you can't slow it down you can't prevent it from happening it's the ancient of days it's the judge himself can you want to see this what's this and he that is righteous let him be righteous let the wicked remain wicked and filthy go to daniel chapter 12. what's the what's the continuity what's the continuity of that scripture as it it's laid right on the right on the end of the scripture when daniel begin to see it when the when in the latter part of daniel 12 for time sake daniel sees the sign of the end is the holy ghost capping the people one standing wide on the water which is christ coming on to the people and when he sees this daniel said he saw it he said and i heard the man in clothing say the water's river he held up his right hand in his left hand daniel 10 revelation 10 again amen and he says in whom we have accomplished scattered the power of the holy people and all these things shall be finished and i heard but i understood not then he said oh my lord what shall be the end of these things he said go that way daniel the words are closed up and sealed to the time of the end many shall be purified made white and tried watch this revelation 22 right here in daniel 12 but the wicked shall do wickedly and none of the wicked shall understand but the wise what the wise shall understand say preacher what are you saying at the time when the book is open there will be a spirit of understanding among the people there will be a people who understands what's being opened to them listen friends people then they'll take it to the intellectual and i and i am one preacher that hates intellectuals i hate an intellectual spirit worse and i hate anything because they make it about what man can do but man cannot understand this intellectuals cannot understand this that woman at the whale was not an intellectual she was a jean seed and she understood that god was the one talking to her and when the seals are opened up the genes see when they hear this word it's going to believe it now you wasn't a smart person you weren't educated you wasn't a bible student but when you heard it brother ben when he was in that in the amish community you heard the word you come out of it why did you come not because you had a great education but you understood that god was dealing with you brother amos that's what happened god was dealing with you what happened to you when you come out of the baptist what happened when you come out of the lutheran what happened when you come off the bar room understanding was coming to you because of the spirit of understanding america now when the spirit of understanding shall come now i'm about to close in ephesians chapter one i want you to watch this dedicated dedicated to a message ephesians chapter one we're dealing with understanding now the god of our lord jesus christ the father glory the spirit of wisdom and revelation the knowledge of him the eyes of your understanding mean the light that you may know what is the hope of the calling what is the riches of the glory and the heritage and saints and what is the exceeding great power to us who believe according to the working of his mighty power so when the spirit of revelation of wisdom comes understanding comes and with understanding power with understanding power when you understand who you are you have a different authority when you understand you belong here you have a different authority you don't belong here brother matt because i told you to be here you don't belong here because somebody else asked you to be here you belong because god told you to be here when he opened up that word he understood that i'm to preach that message i'm understood i'm the preacher right here amen and at the same time it give others understanding to do the same thing amen what is it it's a feeling under a certain word that god releases in a certain season amen now now that god has different brothers preaching different all over this area but it's for one purpose it's to bring everybody to one purpose it's a rapture of the church this is not about men's ministries this is about christ this is about christ coming in the church this is about a rapture listen to me the world is falling apart what difference does the church building make what difference does it make where you are in a church building or another church building it's all about to burn but if you are dedicated to this message this message will lift you like nothing else can lift you [Applause] the spirit of wisdom and revelation will come upon the church and understanding amen now watch this i'm going to close with this scripture revelation chapter 3. look at look at the scripture here he says it here very clearly in the 21st verse and to him that overcometh what i grant to set with me and my throne as i have overcame and sat down with my father in his throne to him that overcometh will i grant to set with me in my throne to him that overcometh can i ask you all a question how do i overcome good question william branham preaches an entire sermon how can i overcome he starts out by saying don't ask the question what i am to overcome ask how can i overcome because the what is going to change the what might be a entertainment to one man the what might be whiskey to another the what might be the nomination to another the what might be the tradition of my family to another it's not what you're overcoming it's how you're overcoming and he said how did jesus himself overcome it is written that's the way you overcome it is written come on now jesus was the most powerful thing in the world he never defeated the devil with supernatural power he defeated with it is written i wonder how the bride will overcome the antichrist come on how will she overcome the antichrist according to revelation chapter 12 it tells you how she overcomes it says she overcame by the blood and by the word of her testimony how are you going to overcome this devil by the word of the season you're living in and how can the church overcome if there is no word if there's no prophet if there's no power but here we're standing in this hour when god has sent the unveiling of the message itself into our season not just to be a book on a tape or a message booker not just to say i'm in the message or not just to put a tape on the shelf or to put a book up somewhere and identify with some group somewhere he sent a message that there would be a group of overcomers in the last day because he has prophesied there will be a greater power than the roman kingdom in the last day there will be a church upon the earth that is greater than the antichrist there will be a pride that is greater than every devil he has more power than every enemy she will be that risen pride who is in authority by the word of god now listen when you read this scripture right here it says something very clearly and he said to him that overcometh what i grant to sit in to set in my brother brian brother brown takes that one little word and shows us something he said that's a spiritual kingdom he said because when jesus was raised his kingdom was his domain by his spirit so wherever that spirit is resting wherever the headship of christ is that is his dominion and to you that overcome you have been put into another kingdom that's why you're not american that's why you're not german amen that's why you're not lutheran that's not you're not baptist that's why you're a christian church because you've been put into another kingdom by a word that you now share in now watch look at the beauty look at the beauty of the scripture just on one little word he said you'll set in the kingdom but if you go to revelation the 20th chapter and you like to read the fourth verse it said that i beheld thrones and they that set upon them in revelation chapter 20 do you all know there are thrones set up in the millennial kingdom of jesus christ do you know that jesus is going to be the king of the entire earth after the battle of armageddon jesus will set up a millennial kingdom upon this earth that will be at least a thousand years long you know why a thousand years because he told he told adam the day you see him you shall die but jesus is going to prove to the devil that we have paid the debt of adam and man will now live to be a thousand years old he will prove to the devil there is no sin against you there's no demon that can hold you you will set up on a throne in the millennium but today we are not in the millennium [Applause] listen to me we're not in the millennium go crawl in the cage with a tiger he will eat you you're not in the millennium listen to me it would not be miraculous to see miracles in the millennium it would not be miraculous to see overcomers in the millennium but when you come to the layout of seeing age the darkest of all ages and there is a bride that will rise up in the middle of the ages and be a weapon with god it'll be a strong power it'll be an anointing it'll be an overcoming sister loretta as an overcoming church that's come upon the earth today he been listening to things that paul preached had never come into fulfillment till now amen listen to me what paul was prophesying to the thessalonians they didn't live out but you are living out what he prophesied to the corinthians they didn't live but you are living when he said you shall be lifted up they was not the ones lifted but you have been lifted up today in heavenly places in christ to sit with him in dominion authority with power over every devil let me tell you some young girls it's not one devil it's not one hollywood spirit it's not one power that can have dominion over you if you'll let christ come into your heart [Music] richard what are you saying i'm saying there's a group of people sitting here right now that is the most powerful force on the face of the entire earth there is nothing of greater power there is nothing of greater authority there is nothing that goes higher than the church of the living god with the baptism of the holy ghost right here this morning every spirit has been placed under your feet now you were you were having a good time when we were seeing that rome was going to rule to the end and i was showing you specifically scripture that rome would rule to the end but the same bible that said rome would rule to the end said there's a bride rising up in the last day there's a church that's going to rise up and take a priority over every devil over every power over every reality human supporting young people you don't have to submit to this demon you don't have to submit to this devil you've got to advise you this morning [Applause] come and fall on the rock come and fall on the rock can our musicians come come and fall on the rock when you fall on the rock it'll break everything listen when this revelation rolls i showed you in the scripture i showed you that it was going to tear down every kingdom how many knows this revelation 11 the seventh angel announces the kingdoms of the world become the kingdoms of god what message is that anyhow the same message you're listening to is the same message that's announcing the end of the world it's the one putting you on the throne but when you preach that message a little strong listen if you understood what it was you preach it strong too if you've seen this is what elevates you to a position of authority this is what adopts the church this is what places them in a position i know how it goes save this week lost this week matt loves me this week matt don't love me next week i'm mad at the church this week i'm not mad at this next it's just like this but if you ever get a believer who starts getting under the word of this message amen there's something begins to stabilize that believer they become comfy lifted up they're lifted up above bad moods they're lifting them up above the feelings they're lifted up above the fashions they're lifting above good church patchers and then something's on the inside of them wherever they are that's a good place to be because there's an atmosphere that's on the inside of them you won't beat it out of them you won't drive it out of them you won't bring them down place them down there's a revival and it's going on the church of the living god listen to me i'm not looking for the revival i am [Applause] amen that has positioned brother me i've had a bunch of them tell me if you don't listen to me you're finished if you don't do what i say you're finished let me tell you i'm required to listen to one i'm required to obey one and that is our lord jesus christ that picture you're acting pretty crazy brother i'm dedicated to a message and if you're standing on this rock this is the same rock that moses stood on [Music] i can't help it you were standing in jerusalem and we're standing here together and you look up and down the hill comes a white mule there's a man named jesus riding on the back of that mule and i say to you hey there's zechariah right there that's saccharide if that hit your heart that that was zechariah 9 they wouldn't nobody stop your praise nobody they ain't nobody can keep you from running up and down the street saying that's zechariah nine that's zachariah there he is behold thy king he cometh he's riding how would you stop it they saw what it was i'm not saying this is zechariah 9. this is malachi 4. this is revelation in luke 17 30. how you going to stop it i already see it [Applause] revival you want to have a revival we are the revival wherever we are wherever we go put us in a part we'll turn it into the house of god put us in africa we'll turn the jungle upside down hallelujah [Applause] tear down every family lift the rock lift the message [Applause] oh you don't like that watch this i see it i see it revelations here is fulfilled anakin 4 is fulfilled [Applause] [Music] listen to me the same power that sealed it said unseal it do you don't thank god with a preacher in this message listen i preach this message in the jungles of africa i appreciate it in the huts of peru and on the banks of the amazon river i preached it in europe i preached it among intellectuals i preached it against illegitimate i preached it against coloreds blacks whites yellows blues i preached it in every type of situation you can preach it and you know something i found out it has power wherever you put it you put it in a drunkard he's got power you put it [Applause] and make a preacher out of him i'm dedicated to this message hallelujah what an hour to serve him it works church this message works i wonder this morning you want to dedicate something to it when abraham saw where he was standing he built an altar as jehovah's ira he dedicated the place come on when moses was upon the mountain threw up his hands he said jehovah's eye panel he built an altar he dedicated a place you can go up on mount upon mount carmel right now and they got a circle of rocks

next week we had a pretty good series going but i don't even know my goodness after hearing these brothers and powerful ministries that they have man i just don't even feel adequate to preach but the lord will provide you man just thank each one of you we got another dinner provided i want to say i don't know where my wife she's out there somewhere but it means a lot to have a godly wife i know a lot of y'all may not realize it but the sacrifices that you have to make to be in that office and i spend about 60 to 70 80 hours some weeks alone by myself and praying and locked away in my office and kind of takes away from the time that we grown accustomed to spending and you know sure brings a strain on the family and i know god has gave me a wife that could be a part of this ministry and you know i believe prophet told us that when god calls a man called his wife too and i sure appreciate her for for taking a stand on this gospel i watch god change your life i was a witness it's easy for somebody on the outside to say you know that's a christian but when somebody lives in the house with you they really know i watch god change your life and she's changed mine i really appreciate it and i appreciate all of y'all this that god's brought you to this place and called you is not to not just to be a partner or to support me i never want credit and y'all that know me i don't never ask for it don't have no desire for it but if anything we can do to put our shoulders to the wheel and win another soul for jesus christ that's our desire i appreciate brother joe and brother mark ministers here in our local assembly and putting their shoulder to the wheel and we all have the same vision we want to make a rapture we're going to be a part of this rapture it may happen tomorrow maybe next year but we'll work till jesus comes and thank each one of you being a part let's just bow our heads and ask the lord to be with each one of you as you go and remember the meetings brother when the martins had asked us to announce in a couple of weeks in pawnee oklahoma and look forward to that any of you that can come and certainly going to be a good time in the lord and gracious heavenly father we love you lord and we're so thankful for your presence here this morning this weekend what i don't even have the words to say to thank all these men lord these brothers that god i see the wonderful gifts of their life and i just always noticed little things and i've seen the each one of them even as a young man i saw people grow that was just my friends and or how that whenever your spirit would come and call them to a purpose in their life lord i watched them grow and i just aspire to be a just a piece of the christian or a part of the christian that they are god i thank you for each one of them lord me and women lord that you've raised up in our lives lord as as pillars in the church lord these elders in this assembly this morning god that i've looked to my whole life look how humbling it is lord to stand in a pulpit and even preach anything to them god i thank you for them i thank you for their stand god i pray you bless each one of them this morning god every young person lord i pray that they would see that same vision lord to know that there's something in this life that you have called us to god i pray that they dedicate their lives to it as young men and young women call that they would dedicate their time lord how would they make plans for their future lord that they would go to you and say god what would you have me to do who would you have me to be lord i pray you would continue to lead our lives lord for every church lord i pray lord we can be a blessing for any group in this area lord i pray god we could be an encouragement lord we could be just a pill or a blessing to them lord just to help because we certainly don't want to put down anybody but lord let us lift them up or let us edify them to the best of our ability lord and god when we don't have the ability to do it lord i pray you put the words in our mouth and the love in our hearts oh that's our real desire is to have the love of christ lord go with each one lord because we leave this meeting in the closing order so hard to leave this atmosphere but god one day will come to me that we'll never have to leave caught it until that day lord may we bind together this little bride that's around the world god i praise you and bless you give every minister the words to say lord every pastor the the courage to stand the test of time lord every believer the faith to stand in the face of all adversity that would come in this age and we glorify that name we thank you for once again we dedicate this place to you lord once again in the name of jesus christ god
