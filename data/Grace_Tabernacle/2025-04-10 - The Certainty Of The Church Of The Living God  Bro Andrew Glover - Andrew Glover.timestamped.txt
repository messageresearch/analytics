[31:18] So, we're just in great anticipation
[31:20] what God has to speak through
[31:23] [Music]
[31:27] him. My boat of
[31:30] life saves all a troubled sea.
[31:34] [Music]
[31:36] Ever there's a wind in my
[31:41] sail. Oh, but I have a
[31:45] friend who's watching over
[31:49] me. Oh, when the breeze turns into a
[31:54] gift. Oh, aren't you thankful you know
[31:56] him this evening that I know the master
[32:00] of the
[32:04] way? And I know the maker of the
[32:10] rain. And he can calm the storms, make
[32:15] the sun to shine
[32:18] again. Oh, I know the master of the
[32:22] wind. Second verse now.
[32:26] Sometimes I soar like an eagle in the
[32:31] sky. Oh, above the peaks my soul can be
[32:38] found. But then an unexpected
[32:42] storm. It may drive me from the heights.
[32:46] It may bring me no, but it'll never
[32:49] bring me down.
[32:53] For I
[32:54] know
[33:03] the
[33:07] rain for he can calm the
[33:10] storms make the sun shine again.
[33:16] I know the master of the
[33:21] way. Sometimes I
[33:24] saw like an eagle through the
[33:28] sky among the peace my soul can be
[33:32] [Applause]
[33:34] found. But when an unexpected
[33:38] storm it may drive me from the
[33:41] highs, it may bring me low. It will
[33:44] never keep me
[33:48] down. For I know the master of the
[33:55] wind. I
[33:57] know the maker of the
[34:01] rain. He can calm the
[34:05] storm. Make the sun come out again.
[34:11] I know the master of the
[34:16] way. Well, Moses led the children of
[34:19] Israel across the desert to be set
[34:22] free. They were stranded between the
[34:25] river and the
[34:29] enemy. Well, Pharaoh's army was shouting
[34:32] out loud. They thought things were
[34:34] finally going their way. But then Moses
[34:38] stepped out on a rock and they heard him
[34:40] [Applause]
[34:43] say, "I know the master of the
[34:49] wind. Yes, my Lord, I know the maker of
[34:54] the
[34:55] rain. He can calm every
[34:58] storm and make the sun come out again.
[35:05] I know the master of the
[35:08] way. Amen. Won't you give the Lord a
[35:10] hand clap of praise this evening? How
[35:13] many knows the master?
[35:16] Amen. Praise the Lord. We've got the God
[35:19] on the scene in the midst of the
[35:21] greatest storms. Not only is he in the
[35:24] boat, but he can walk on water. He can
[35:26] walk over every storm. There ain't
[35:28] there's never a storm that he didn't
[35:29] create or that he didn't have power
[35:31] over. Amen. He created all things. Do
[35:34] you believe that? I believe he has power
[35:36] over every storm, the storms of our
[35:38] life. And amen. He's such a great God.
[35:40] And we come to worship him this evening.
[35:44] We love the Lord. Had a prayer request.
[35:46] We're going to give brother Andrew just
[35:48] a minute. We're looking forward to just
[35:49] allow him to come and speak to us
[35:51] tonight and and just allow the Lord to
[35:54] use him. And certainly been in I enjoy
[35:57] the presence of the Lord. I enjoy good
[35:59] worship. And I want to give a just a
[36:02] kind of a a brief report. I won't go
[36:04] into detail, but you know, we had some
[36:07] uh damage on the fellowship hall and
[36:09] just to keep everybody from wandering,
[36:11] I'll just say it like this. All is well.
[36:14] So everything's going to work out really
[36:16] good for us. So we just appreciate the
[36:19] Lord. He can take things that look like
[36:20] a disaster and make it work out for our
[36:22] good. He always does. So, we just trust
[36:25] the Lord in the midst of every storm,
[36:27] uh, that there's something good coming
[36:29] on the other side. We want to remember
[36:32] in prayer, uh, Sister Sherry Allen is
[36:35] sick tonight. Also, uh, Brother Randall
[36:39] is homesick and also, Brother David
[36:41] Gates is real sick and David West, this
[36:44] is Sister Eden's husband, Sister Eve's
[36:47] brother-in-law, is low blood pressure,
[36:48] asking for prayer. Um, remember Sister
[36:51] Kaitton, uh, She had had a gallbladder
[36:55] surgery this week. Also, Sister Leah, we
[36:58] were down there, had an operation done
[37:00] on her neck and uh they headed home this
[37:02] afternoon, had a few or night, a couple
[37:06] nights to stay there. So, uh but they
[37:08] are home and just trust the Lord will
[37:10] will heal and uh and do what God does.
[37:14] Amen. And so, we just believe that you
[37:16] love the Lord. Amen. and we just maybe
[37:19] if you have a need on your heart, but
[37:20] Dave, could you come and pray over these
[37:22] requests for us? And
[37:25] [Music]
[37:33] Amen. Let's bow our
[37:37] hearts. Our precious heavenly
[37:42] father, Lord, you're so good to us,
[37:45] Lord. Lord, you sent your word. The
[37:48] Bible says that it healed
[37:51] them. Lord, I believe tonight
[37:54] that you know each one and you know our
[37:57] ups and downs and ins and outs and Lord,
[38:00] you see the ones that has been brought
[38:03] before you tonight that's sick. And
[38:05] Sister Leah with the neck surgery. And
[38:09] God, I believe tonight that you're a
[38:11] mighty healer. The Bible says that you
[38:14] was wounded for our transgressions. He
[38:16] was bruised for our iniquity. In the
[38:19] chastisement, our peace was upon you.
[38:21] And by your stripes, we were healed. And
[38:24] Lord, we believe your word tonight. But
[38:26] even the world was framed by the word of
[38:29] God. We come tonight asking Lord for
[38:33] each one of these. And I couldn't even
[38:36] mentally think of each one and go back
[38:38] through it. But you knew, Lord, before
[38:40] those ever asked, you knew what was
[38:42] asked. And you knew all about it. And
[38:44] you're concerned. And I pray tonight,
[38:46] Lord, that you'd be with them. Lord, I
[38:48] pray you'd be in the remainder of this
[38:50] service. And Lord, I pray you'd prepare
[38:52] our hearts. And may we be ready to
[38:54] receive the word. And when we leave
[38:56] here, may we say like those coming from
[38:58] Emas, did not our hearts burn within us
[39:00] as we talk to you along the road. And
[39:02] we'd be careful to give you the praise.
[39:04] We ask it in Jesus name.
[39:08] [Music]
[39:10] Amen. Amen. You believe God knows what
[39:12] we have need of. Amen. And I believe
[39:15] he's mindful of us. He knows every
[39:17] battle we've ever faced and what we're
[39:19] going through. Amen. How many just trust
[39:21] the Lord? Can you lift your hand? How
[39:23] many say amen? Man, we just trust the
[39:26] Lord that he knows all things and he has
[39:28] everything in control. Amen. Do you
[39:31] believe that tonight?
[39:34] [Music]
[39:36] He's God of my
[39:39] present, God of my future.
[39:43] He wrote my
[39:46] story. He holds it all
[39:49] together. God of my
[39:53] presence. God of my
[39:56] future, you write my
[39:59] story, you hold it all

[40:34] You
[40:36] come at the right
[40:39] time when I least
[40:43] expected. You'll never
[40:47] behind. So
[40:49] why would I be
[40:53] surprised when you deliver
[40:57] me every time?
[41:01] For on mountain
[41:04] tops you stay the same. And in the
[41:09] valley low Lord you never
[41:14] change. And I
[41:17] believe that I will
[41:21] see the goodness
[41:24] of the
[41:27] Lord. Well, I'm
[41:31] confident as seasons change that your
[41:37] faithfulness
[41:40] remains. For you are God of my
[41:45] presence, God of my
[41:48] future. You write my
[41:52] story. You hold it all together.
[41:56] God of my presence. Thank you. God of my

[42:11] Yes, you're God.

[42:24] it all together.
[42:26] You hold it all
[42:28] together. You hold it all
[42:32] together. You hold it all
[42:35] together. You hold it all
[42:39] together. You hold it all

[42:45] together. You hold it all
[42:49] together. God of my presence.
[42:53] Amen. Can you say it tonight? love you.
[42:55] You're the God of my present. You're the
[42:57] God of my future.
[42:59] Yes, Lord. You held it all together. In
[43:04] my greatest trial,
[43:07] you hold it all together. When I felt
[43:11] like giving up, yes, Lord, you hold it
[43:15] all together.
[43:17] God of my
[43:19] presence, God of my
[43:23] future, you write my
[43:26] story. You hold it all

[43:45] Oh Lord, you
[43:48] come at the right
[43:51] time when I least
[43:55] expected. You'll never be
[43:59] high. So
[44:01] why would I ever be
[44:05] surprised when you come to deliver
[44:08] me each and every
[44:12] time? For I know you're God of my
[44:16] presence,
[44:18] God of my
[44:20] future, God.
[44:23] Yes, Lord. You hold it all together. You
[44:29] are the
[44:30] ala. You're the
[44:34] Omega. You're in the
[44:37] middle. You hold it all together.
[44:41] God of my
[44:44] present, God of my
[44:47] future, you write my
[44:50] story. You hold it all together.
[44:57] [Music]
[44:59] Amen. Won't you give the Lord a hand
[45:00] clap of praise? Go reach around, shake
[45:02] somebody's hand, tell them it's God that
[45:04] holds it all together. Give them a word
[45:07] of encouragement tonight in the middle
[45:08] of her greatest storms, but God holds it
[45:11] all together. Anybody got that testimony
[45:13] in their life that was going through a
[45:15] trial, but God held it together? Turn
[45:16] around and tell somebody your testimony
[45:18] tonight. It was God that held it all
[45:21] together. Cuz he's God of my
[45:25] future, God of my
[45:28] present. You write my
[45:31] story. You hold it all together.
[45:36] God of my
[45:40] presence. Yes, Lord. You write my
[45:45] story. You hold it all
[45:49] together. You hold it all
[45:52] together. You hold it all
[45:56] together. You hold it all
[45:59] together. You hold it all together.
[46:04] God of my
[46:06] [Music]
[46:14] presence. You hold it all
[46:18] together. How many can give him a hand
[46:20] clap of praise tonight? Amen. How many
[46:24] witnesses do we have here tonight that
[46:26] God holds it all together? Amen. I don't
[46:29] know about you, but Amen. And we can
[46:31] look back over our lives and see the
[46:33] times we thought everything was going to
[46:34] fall apart. Amen. But here we are today.
[46:37] Amen. Still pressing the battle, still
[46:39] moving forward, still possessing the
[46:42] promises of God. And Amen. It's all
[46:44] because he's God. He's God of our
[46:46] present. He's the God of our future.
[46:49] Amen. I love the way the prophet of God
[46:51] said it. He said, "I came back from
[46:52] Africa that time and he said, I was
[46:54] laying there on the bed and sick with
[46:56] that amoeba in his body." You remember
[46:58] that? And he said, "I was laying there
[47:00] praying. And I thought, Lord, with this
[47:02] condition in my body, there's no way I
[47:04] can continue to travel and minister. He
[47:06] said, but then all of a sudden, out of
[47:07] the heavens, he said, the angel of the
[47:08] Lord come in the room. And he said he
[47:10] had a handful of papers and he just
[47:12] threw them up in the air. And he looked
[47:14] at him and he said, "Your future's
[47:15] clear." Amen. And I I got to thinking
[47:18] about that one day. That was a long time
[47:20] before the doors begin slamming in his
[47:22] face or before his friends started
[47:24] rejecting him or before things seemingly
[47:26] begin to fall apart for him. But yet the
[47:29] angel of the Lord already told him his
[47:31] future was clear. And I believe right
[47:33] here tonight, there's no doubt a lot of
[47:35] trials ahead of us if time should terry.
[47:37] But we have a more sure word of prophecy
[47:39] tonight that our future is clear. Amen.
[47:42] How many will trust the report of the
[47:44] angel tonight. Amen. Let's just bow our
[47:46] hearts together. Heavenly Father, Lord,
[47:48] what an honor it is to be in your house
[47:50] tonight to be gathered, Lord, here with
[47:52] believers of like precious faith. Lord,
[47:54] children of yours that have come, Lord,
[47:56] from every different walk of life. Lord,
[47:59] you've called us together under the
[48:00] oposes of this revealed word, Lord, to
[48:03] serve you and to love you and to live
[48:05] for you. And Lord, we know the enemy is
[48:07] doing everything he can in times like
[48:09] these to suppress the faith of your
[48:12] children, Lord, to destroy the
[48:14] confidence of the children of God and
[48:15] the word of God. But Lord, we've
[48:17] gathered here tonight under the banner
[48:19] of the love of Jesus, Lord, that you
[48:22] love us and we love you and there's
[48:24] nothing in the past, the present, or the
[48:26] future that can destroy you or destroy
[48:29] us or our love for one another. So Lord,
[48:31] tonight as we endeavor to look into your
[48:33] word on this Wednesday evening, I pray,
[48:36] oh God, you would send the angel of the
[48:37] Lord through the building tonight.
[48:39] Father, on this Wednesday evening, this
[48:41] midweek of the services, Lord, I know
[48:44] there's many pressures and many things,
[48:45] no doubt, laying upon the hearts of your
[48:47] children. But Lord, for just a few
[48:49] moments tonight, would you drive out
[48:51] every spirit that's unlike the Holy
[48:52] Spirit? Lord, bind the hand of the enemy
[48:55] that we could, Lord, receive from your
[48:57] word tonight that we would be benefited
[48:59] by our gathering together. Lord, may the
[49:02] word be more than just quotes and
[49:03] scriptures tonight, but Lord, may it be
[49:06] a conference with you, oh God. Lord,
[49:07] that lives would be changed. Father, you
[49:10] see those that are home tonight
[49:11] suffering in their bodies. Lord, I pray
[49:13] the angel of deliverance would go by
[49:15] their homes and deliver them. Father,
[49:17] Lord, those that are empty tonight,
[49:18] needing something from you. May you fill
[49:20] them, oh God. Forgive us of our failures
[49:23] and our shortcomings. Lord, we want to
[49:25] be more like you, Father. Take this word
[49:27] tonight and may we b be benefited by it.
[49:30] We love and thank you for all things in
[49:32] Jesus' name we pray. And all the
[49:35] believers says, "Amen and amen." God
[49:38] Richie bless you tonight. You love the
[49:40] Lord. Amen. God bless you. Amen. Good to
[49:42] see you, Brother Brian. Amen. God rich
[49:44] bless you. Amen. If you have your Bibles
[49:46] tonight, we want to go to the word of
[49:47] the Lord. We want to turn to the book of
[49:49] First Timothy the third chapter. Amen.
[49:51] My wasn't that just a wonderful song
[49:53] service. Amen. The presence of the Lord
[49:55] moving. We we sure appreciate the the
[49:58] spirit of the Lord for moving and Amen.
[50:00] just Amen. Seeing the gift of the Lord
[50:02] developing there and our brother Ben.
[50:04] Amen. Such a Amen. Such a privilege to
[50:06] serve the Lord. Amen. And want to say we
[50:08] do appreciate all the prayers and
[50:10] support there in the youth camp over in
[50:11] Oklahoma a few days ago. And Amen. We uh
[50:14] seen the Lord do some miraculous things
[50:16] there and marvelous things. And Amen.
[50:18] I'll say this, Grace Tabernacle was well
[50:21] represented. Amen. And Amen. had brother
[50:23] Mark and the family and several of the
[50:24] young people there. And Amen. those that
[50:26] sang just a a real blessing. It's a
[50:28] Amen. It's a special thing to see the
[50:30] Lord doing something in the lives of the
[50:31] young people. Amen. to know this message
[50:34] ain't going to hit the ground. Amen. God
[50:35] will raise up somebody. Amen. I was
[50:38] speaking over there and it just came to
[50:39] me that there's been a lot of preachers
[50:41] that got real important and God set them
[50:43] down on the side. But God will take
[50:45] young people and raise them up and he'll
[50:46] prove to this world, brother David, this
[50:49] message is the truth. Amen. Amen. So we
[50:51] say God bless you tonight and sure good
[50:53] to be home and be speaking to you. 1
[50:55] Timothy chapter 3 and verse number 15.
[50:59] Paul here writing to Timothy, he says,
[51:02] "But if I tar long that thou mayest know
[51:05] how thou oughtest to behave thyself in
[51:07] the house of God, which is the church of
[51:11] the living God." I love how Paul just
[51:14] describes you as a people. the house of
[51:16] God, which is the church of the living
[51:18] God, which is the pillar and the ground
[51:21] of the truth. Without controversy, great
[51:25] is the mystery of godliness. For God was
[51:28] manifest in the flesh. Can we say God
[51:31] was manifested in the church? God was
[51:34] manifested in the flesh, justified in
[51:36] the spirit, seen of angels, preached
[51:39] unto the Gentiles, and believed on in
[51:42] the world, and received up into glory.
[51:46] Now, in the book of Daniel, the 11th
[51:48] chapter in the Old Testament, the book
[51:50] of Daniel, the 11th chapter, I want to
[51:53] look there in Daniel chapter 11. Amen.
[51:56] In verse 32, I know it's a very familiar
[51:59] reading. We know it by heart. In Daniel
[52:01] 11 and 32, the Bible says, "And such as
[52:04] do wickedly against the covenant shall
[52:07] he corrupt by
[52:08] flatteries. But the people, can I say
[52:11] the church, but the people that do know
[52:15] their God shall be weak and barely make
[52:18] it and barely holding on. But the people
[52:21] that do know their God shall be strong
[52:25] and do exploits." So they're not just
[52:28] going to be a strength there, but
[52:29] there's going to be a testimony that's
[52:32] testifying of the strength. They shall
[52:34] be strong and do great exploits. We ask
[52:36] the Lord this evening to add the
[52:37] blessing to the reading of his word. As
[52:39] you can have your seats here, I want
[52:40] tonight by the help of the Lord, if I
[52:42] would take a title tonight, I want to
[52:44] speak to you on this on the certainty of
[52:47] the church of the living God. The
[52:49] certainty of the church of the living
[52:51] God. Of course, the last time we spoke
[52:52] to you, we were speaking on the
[52:54] unlimited powerful church of the living
[52:56] God. And I'll just say I thought that
[52:58] was maybe just a sermon but just in
[53:00] study the Lord has been opening up some
[53:02] things to me on the church of the living
[53:04] God. And tonight I want to share just
[53:06] another portion with you if that's okay.
[53:08] Amen. Brother Brandham in 1951 and again
[53:10] in 1960 he preaches two very powerful
[53:13] sermons on the subject of the church of
[53:15] the living God. 1951 he actually titles
[53:18] it the church of the living God. Then in
[53:21] 1960 he preaches on five definite
[53:24] identifications of the church of the
[53:26] living God. And as you study through the
[53:28] message you will find amen that brother
[53:30] Brandon will use that term about 420
[53:33] times. Amen. The church of the living
[53:36] God. Now I started going through all
[53:38] those quotes and I'm not going to read
[53:39] them all to you but they're very
[53:40] powerful quotes. Amen. To hear a prophet
[53:43] Amen. really identify amen from the
[53:46] Bible who we really are. in 1960 the
[53:49] five definite identification. He said
[53:51] now the word church on each one of those
[53:53] subjects that I have chosen tonight to
[53:55] speak to you on one of it is what is the
[53:58] church? Now he asked five different
[54:00] questions. What is the church? Who set
[54:02] it up? What is its message? How do we
[54:04] become a member of it? And can we get to
[54:06] heaven without being a member of it? He
[54:09] said now each one of those texts could
[54:11] last for hours. Amen. Combing back and
[54:14] forth. He said, "But I wish to hit a few
[54:16] fundamental points to show, Amen. what
[54:19] the real church is, right?" Amen. What
[54:22] the real church is. He said, "And now,
[54:24] Amen. I want I want you to have your
[54:26] Bibles." I I don't know about you, but
[54:28] that does my heart such good to hear a
[54:30] prophet, Amen, say, "I'm getting ready
[54:32] to identify to you what the Church of
[54:34] the Living God is." Amen. And I want you
[54:37] to have your Bibles. Now, now, this is
[54:39] not coming from his school that he went
[54:41] to. It's not coming, Amen, from his
[54:43] imagination. But he's going to turn in
[54:45] the Bible and he's going to identify
[54:47] what the real church is. In Revelation
[54:49] 12:1, there appeared a great wonder in
[54:52] heaven, a woman clothed with a sun.
[54:54] Amen. And the moon under her feet and
[54:56] upon her head, amen, there was a crown
[54:59] of 12 stars. Mark of the Beast, 1954. He
[55:02] said, "What does that woman represent?"
[55:04] He says, "The church." See? Amen. This
[55:07] is the bride here. This is the church.
[55:10] The real church. He said the real church
[55:12] of the living God will be condemned.
[55:15] Amen. By the Catholic and the
[55:17] Protestant. How many knows that
[55:18] Christianity has been broken down into
[55:21] two great organizations or groups? The
[55:23] Catholic Church, Amen, and then the
[55:25] Protestant church. But here the prophet
[55:27] is showing, Amen, that the real church
[55:30] is neither going to be Catholic. Amen.
[55:32] And neither is she going to be
[55:34] Protestant. Amen. Because they will
[55:36] unite together. They're already together
[55:38] as one. Amen. And he shows you that they
[55:40] are a mother and they are a daughter.
[55:42] Right? Amen. The mother is the great
[55:44] Amen. That Roman Catholic church.
[55:46] Amen. But she had daughters which are
[55:48] those Protestant denomination. He said,
[55:50] "But if our hearts condemn us, then we
[55:53] want complete deliverance. We don't want
[55:55] to be a halfway church." How many agree?
[55:57] We don't want to be a halfway church.
[55:59] Amen. We want to be a real church or no
[56:02] church at all. Amen. We want to be a
[56:04] real church or no church at all. He
[56:06] said, "We want to be real Christians or
[56:08] no Christians at all." So, amen. There's
[56:11] only one real, amen, true living church.
[56:14] Amen. And that is the bride of Jesus
[56:17] Christ. David would say the prophet of
[56:19] God, speaking of David, he said, was in
[56:21] one of his worst times. He was a
[56:22] fugitive, but he had already been
[56:24] anointed. He know what he was to be. He
[56:27] was to be king because God said so. And
[56:30] yet, he was hated. Now, watch this. He
[56:32] was standing in between two great deep
[56:34] fires. Amen. Here was the Philistine on
[56:37] one side. Amen. And here was Saul on the
[56:39] other. But he was a man without a
[56:42] nation. Now watch a prophet turn from
[56:43] David. Amen. To the church. And he said,
[56:46] just as the church stands today, amen,
[56:49] the true church of the living God
[56:51] without a denomination or anything else.
[56:54] Amen. She stands alone. Amen. But she's
[56:58] had the anointing poured on her. Amen.
[57:00] That's a beautiful that David was
[57:02] between two great fires. Amen. But the
[57:05] fact was the anointing was already upon
[57:07] him. Amen. So the Philistines couldn't
[57:10] kill him and Saul couldn't defeat him.
[57:12] And I tell you tonight, the anointing is
[57:14] already upon you. Amen. And the devil
[57:17] can't defeat you. Amen. Your past can't
[57:19] defeat you. Amen. The anointing has
[57:22] already been released upon this church.
[57:24] Amen. I love what a prophet says. He
[57:27] says she knows what she is. Amen. David
[57:31] knew who he was. He knew he was a king
[57:34] coming into power. And here is the
[57:36] bride, the church. Amen. And she knows
[57:39] who she is. I'll say this. Satan hates
[57:41] the true church of the living God.
[57:43] Brother said, "The devil's always been
[57:45] after the church of the living God." Is
[57:47] that right? Amen. It's always had a
[57:50] black name. He said Jesus was born in
[57:52] this world with a black name as an
[57:54] illegitimate child. Did you know that?
[57:56] Amen. Supposed to be born a child out of
[57:59] holy wedlock. Amen. Jesus had that
[58:01] hanging on him. Watch this. He had that
[58:04] hanging on him. But in his heart, he
[58:07] knew he was the son of God. Listen. In
[58:10] his heart, he knew he was the son of
[58:12] God. And men and women, you know where
[58:14] you stand tonight. And there's only one
[58:16] more person knows it. That's God knows
[58:18] where you stand. Amen. So if your heart
[58:21] is right with God, really live for him,
[58:24] be true to him, and love him so much
[58:26] that everything else becomes
[58:28] secondarily. And then you'll love the
[58:31] Lord with all your heart, with all your
[58:32] strength, with all your soul, and with
[58:34] all your might. And God, amen, will lead
[58:37] you. Then the footsteps of a righteous
[58:39] man is ordered of the Lord. Amen. Can I
[58:43] show you something? Greater is the
[58:44] revelation in your soul of knowing who
[58:47] you are than the reputation that is
[58:49] hanging over your life. Listen, we don't
[58:52] all have perfect backgrounds. We were
[58:53] all born in sin. We were all shaping
[58:56] iniquity. We all come in the world
[58:58] speaking lies. Amen. But every true seed
[59:00] of God, amen, can testify that no matter
[59:04] how low in sin you went, no matter how
[59:06] far backst you became, there was
[59:09] something in your soul that knew you was
[59:11] born for more than the condition that
[59:13] you were finding yourself in. That is
[59:15] because you are a part, amen, of the
[59:18] church of the living God. Listen, sin
[59:20] don't define you. A bar don't define
[59:22] you. Alcohol don't define you. Hey, but
[59:25] the revelation of Jesus Christ has been
[59:28] sent into this age to identify you.
[59:31] Amen. As more than just church members,
[59:33] as more than just religious people, but
[59:36] to identify you as the real church who
[59:38] knows who she is. She knows where she
[59:41] come from. She knows where she's
[59:43] standing. And praise God, somebody gets
[59:45] you shouting shoes on. She knows where
[59:47] she's going because she has been
[59:50] identified the same way David was and
[59:53] the same way Jesus was. This church is
[59:55] identified by the anointing.
[59:58] Somebody anointing. I know people don't
[1:00:01] believe in it no more, but we believe in
[1:00:02] it around here. We believe in the
[1:00:05] anointing. We believe in anointed
[1:00:07] singing. We believe in anointed praying.
[1:00:09] We believe in anointed preaching. Amen.
[1:00:11] Because it is the anointing that
[1:00:14] destroys the yoke of the enemy. My Jesus
[1:00:18] knew he was the son of God. So does this
[1:00:20] bride know that she is the anointed true
[1:00:24] church of the living God. St. Matthew 16
[1:00:27] again 17 Jesus answered said unto him
[1:00:30] blessed art thou sermon by Jonah Simon
[1:00:33] Barjonah for flesh and blood hath not
[1:00:35] revealed it unto thee. Amen. But my
[1:00:38] father which is in heaven. And I say
[1:00:40] unto thee, thou art Peter, and upon this
[1:00:43] rock I will build my church, and the
[1:00:46] gates of hell shall not prevail against
[1:00:49] it. I don't mean to repeat myself. I
[1:00:51] know I've said it here before. Amen.
[1:00:52] That Peter had more revelation than he
[1:00:55] had mistakes. But can I show you
[1:00:56] something else? Amen. Greater was his
[1:00:58] revelation than his
[1:01:00] reputation. Amen. Greater was Peter's
[1:01:03] revelation, Amen. than his reputation.
[1:01:06] You could go read about where he cursed
[1:01:07] the Lord. You could go read about where
[1:01:09] he denied God. You could go read about
[1:01:12] where he cut the soldier's ear off.
[1:01:14] Amen. But when it come time, amen, to
[1:01:16] identify, amen, who this being was in
[1:01:19] front of him. There was a revelation in
[1:01:21] his soul that said, "Thou art the
[1:01:23] Christ, a son of the living God."
[1:01:25] Brother said, "What is that seven church
[1:01:27] age messenger going to do?" He's going
[1:01:29] to restore the faith of the children.
[1:01:31] Amen. Back to the fathers. In other
[1:01:34] words, he's going to rebuild the church
[1:01:36] again under the power of the spirit.
[1:01:39] Amen. Not by power, not by might, but by
[1:01:41] my spirit, sayaith the Lord. Not by
[1:01:44] organization, nor by denomination. Amen.
[1:01:47] But by the Holy Spirit of God will he
[1:01:50] bring forth the church in the last days.
[1:01:53] Now, I love what the prophet of God
[1:01:54] said. He said that word church means the
[1:01:57] called out. Amen. Israel was not the
[1:01:59] church of God as long as they were in
[1:02:02] Egypt. See? Amen. They were the people
[1:02:04] of God. But when God called them out of
[1:02:06] Egypt, Amen. They became the church of
[1:02:09] God. Amen. Because now they are the
[1:02:12] called out. He said the word church
[1:02:14] means they're called out. Those that
[1:02:16] have been called out. How many have been
[1:02:17] called out? We have been separated and
[1:02:20] we have been made different. Listen, we
[1:02:23] didn't make ourselves different, but the
[1:02:25] call of God that came upon our lives,
[1:02:27] amen, separated us and made us
[1:02:29] different. Amen. as every other church
[1:02:32] member ought to be. Amen. He says in the
[1:02:34] Old Testament, the known church, Amen,
[1:02:36] I'm trying to teach and y'all are
[1:02:38] preaching me. The known church was
[1:02:40] called, Amen, the kingdom of God. In
[1:02:42] other words, God is a king and the
[1:02:44] church is his domain. His, he said, see,
[1:02:47] God's kingdom old testament, but in the
[1:02:50] New Testament, it is called amen, the
[1:02:52] messianic empire. In other words, the
[1:02:55] Messiah's empire where the Messiah rules
[1:02:58] and reigns. There is no denominational
[1:03:01] barriers. Amen. The Messiah rules in his
[1:03:04] empire. Amen. Therefore, the church is
[1:03:07] not an organization. Praise God. Amen.
[1:03:10] Because organization spells death. Amen.
[1:03:13] Listen. The church is not a gathering of
[1:03:15] people. Amen. The church is the people
[1:03:17] of God that's been called out of the
[1:03:20] world. Amen. To serve in another
[1:03:23] kingdom.
[1:03:24] We have been called out of Leosa. We
[1:03:27] have been called out of the world, amen,
[1:03:30] to serve in another kingdom. Therefore,
[1:03:33] we have a king and we have access to our
[1:03:36] king. Other words, where the Messiah
[1:03:38] rules in every life and his dominion.
[1:03:40] Amen. Ruling the lives of his people, a
[1:03:43] called out people from every walk of
[1:03:46] life, gathering together in a group.
[1:03:48] Amen. Then calls it his church. Amen. Or
[1:03:51] his called out ones. I love this. Amen.
[1:03:54] The real church. Somebody say the real
[1:03:56] church. The real church is the mystical
[1:03:58] body of Jesus Christ. Amen. Now, you
[1:04:02] cannot organize, Amen. the mystical body
[1:04:05] of Christ. Amen. If you want to know
[1:04:07] what the real church is, Amen. It's not
[1:04:10] the structure, Amen. of Grace
[1:04:12] Tabernacle. Amen. It's not the structure
[1:04:14] of any other building, Amen. But the
[1:04:16] real church is the people who have been
[1:04:19] called out, amen, of darkness into his
[1:04:21] marvelous life. That's why, Amen.
[1:04:24] Wherever you put us, we can have church.
[1:04:26] Heard Bud Ram say today, he said,
[1:04:28] "There's something about that real
[1:04:29] church." He said, "They'll turn anything
[1:04:31] into a prayer meeting." And I think that
[1:04:33] describes this people right here. Amen.
[1:04:35] Wherever you put us, we're going to have
[1:04:38] a good time. Amen. Cuz we know who we
[1:04:40] are. We know where we come from. We know
[1:04:43] what we're following. And we know where
[1:04:45] we're going. We're not a bunch of
[1:04:46] organized chickens. We're not a bunch of
[1:04:49] denominational buzzards. We are sons and
[1:04:51] daughters of God who has heard the eagle
[1:04:54] scream and there is a cry in our soul to
[1:04:56] come up higher. Amen. To go into
[1:04:58] heavenly places in Christ Jesus where
[1:05:01] all things are possible. You cannot
[1:05:03] organize the mystical body of Christ. My
[1:05:08] don't that make you feel good? What that
[1:05:10] tells me, brother Joe, is nobody can put
[1:05:12] you in and nobody can take you out.
[1:05:14] Well, that ought to make you shout.
[1:05:16] Nobody can approve you and nobody can
[1:05:19] disapprove of you. If God put you in,
[1:05:22] it'll take God to take you out. If God
[1:05:24] saved you, it'll take God to unsave you.
[1:05:27] If God delivers you, it'll take God to
[1:05:29] undeliver you. But what my God does, he
[1:05:32] will perform until the day of our
[1:05:34] redemption. This is the mystical body of
[1:05:37] Christ. I love it because a prophet
[1:05:39] said, "We got to go into our Bibles and
[1:05:42] we got to find out what this real church
[1:05:44] is." Listen, we have been given a
[1:05:46] scriptural description of what this
[1:05:48] church is to look like. Amen. He said,
[1:05:50] Jesus described to us, amen, just what
[1:05:53] the church of the living God will look
[1:05:55] like. He said, in my name, they'll cast
[1:05:58] out devils. They will speak with new
[1:06:00] tongues. If they take up serpents or
[1:06:02] they drink anything, it will not harm
[1:06:04] them. They shall lay their hands on the
[1:06:06] sick, and they shall recover. And the
[1:06:09] things that I do, Amen, shall you do
[1:06:12] also. So when a prophet described, amen,
[1:06:15] what the church was going to look like,
[1:06:17] he didn't turn to the Baptist. He didn't
[1:06:20] turn to the Pentecostals. He turned to
[1:06:22] Mark 16 and he turned to John 14 and
[1:06:26] said, "Now when you read Mark 16 and
[1:06:28] John 14, you are reading a definite
[1:06:30] description of what God said his church
[1:06:33] will look like." In Ephesians 1:22, Paul
[1:06:36] says, "And hath put all things, amen,
[1:06:39] under his feet." Amen. and gave him to
[1:06:42] be the head. Somebody shout the head.
[1:06:45] Over all things to the church. I love
[1:06:47] what he says in verse 23. Which is his
[1:06:50] body. Amen. And the fullness of him that
[1:06:53] fillth all in Colossians 1:17. He is
[1:06:56] before all things and by him all things
[1:06:59] consist. Now here it is. And he is the
[1:07:02] head of the body which is the church.
[1:07:06] who in the beginning the firstborn from
[1:07:08] the dead that in all things he might
[1:07:11] have the preeminence. Listen, he was the
[1:07:14] firstborn. Amen. Among the dead that in
[1:07:17] all things he might have preeminence. Do
[1:07:19] you realize Paul said that we are the
[1:07:21] church of the firstborn. In other words,
[1:07:23] we are the firstborn of God who he has
[1:07:26] been able to gain access to. Amen. By
[1:07:29] the word. Hallelujah. You are a people
[1:07:32] who the word has found an access into
[1:07:34] your life. And you don't do anything
[1:07:36] unless it's in the word. You don't
[1:07:38] believe anything unless it comes from
[1:07:40] the word. You don't say anything unless
[1:07:42] you're saying it from the word. Because
[1:07:44] the church of the living God is the
[1:07:46] pillar of truth. It is the pillar of
[1:07:48] faith. It is a witness that God can get
[1:07:51] into flesh and can manifest himself
[1:07:54] through that redeemed flesh the same way
[1:07:56] he did the flesh of his own son Jesus
[1:07:58] Christ. My I feel like preaching. Who is
[1:08:01] the head of this church? It ain't no
[1:08:03] pope. It ain't no bishop. It's Jesus
[1:08:06] Christ. Amen. And the Bible said we're
[1:08:08] not bound by any fedters, but we're
[1:08:10] walking in the spirit. Amen. Amen. Your
[1:08:12] back is on the things of the world. He
[1:08:14] who the son is made free is free indeed.
[1:08:18] That's the church of the living God, and
[1:08:20] that's who set it up. Amen. So Paul says
[1:08:23] in Ephesians 4:4, he said, "There is one
[1:08:26] body, right? And there is one spirit
[1:08:29] even as you're called into one hope of
[1:08:32] your calling. Now look here. There is
[1:08:34] one universal mystical body. We all
[1:08:37] agree there is one head and there is one
[1:08:40] universal mystical body. But I want to
[1:08:42] say this within that that that mystical
[1:08:45] body there are many members or there's
[1:08:48] many local bodies or there's there or
[1:08:50] there or there's members within the
[1:08:52] body. Hebrew series. He said God chose
[1:08:55] Paul. Man chose Mias. They cast the
[1:08:57] lots, but he never did anything. That
[1:08:59] shows what power the church has then to
[1:09:02] make a choice to elect their deacons and
[1:09:04] send their preachers to different
[1:09:05] places. He said, that's carnal. Many
[1:09:07] times he said, let a man go where God
[1:09:10] leads him to go. He said, I like that
[1:09:12] the people in a conference just say,
[1:09:14] well, here's a nice church. This
[1:09:16] brother's built up a nice church. We
[1:09:17] have a little pet. They'll send him over
[1:09:19] to this church. They don't realize
[1:09:21] they're killing theirelves. See the
[1:09:23] first place if that man goes in there he
[1:09:25] can't feel that man's place then they
[1:09:27] only weaken the church to try to show
[1:09:30] amen favor to some pet. He said now I'm
[1:09:32] just going to say what a prophet said.
[1:09:34] Is that okay? He said I believe in the
[1:09:36] supreme authority of the local assembly.
[1:09:41] I believe in the supreme authority of
[1:09:45] the local assembly. He said yes. Let
[1:09:47] each church be its own. Choose its
[1:09:49] pastors. Choose its deacons. whatever it
[1:09:52] is. And then that way the man in there
[1:09:54] has no bishop over him. The Holy Spirit
[1:09:57] wants to speak something of that church.
[1:09:59] They don't have to ask anybody about
[1:10:01] whether they could do this or do that.
[1:10:03] It's the individual in contact with the
[1:10:06] Holy Spirit. Amen. Show me the by the
[1:10:08] Bible. What's greater in the Bible than
[1:10:11] a local elder to a local church? That's
[1:10:13] right. Yes. The sovereignty of the local
[1:10:16] church. Each church in itself. He said,
[1:10:19] "Now brotherhood, that's wonderful. All
[1:10:21] churches ought to be in a brotherhood."
[1:10:23] Amen. Like that together, but the
[1:10:25] sovereignty of the local church, which
[1:10:28] that brings us back to the church of the
[1:10:30] living God. Listen, this church don't
[1:10:32] belong to no bishop. It don't belong to
[1:10:34] no important preacher. It don't belong
[1:10:36] to no big message preacher. This church
[1:10:38] belongs to God. Therefore, God has put a
[1:10:41] pastor, amen, behind this pullpit, amen,
[1:10:44] as a watchman in the tower, amen, to
[1:10:47] warn off the enemy and to preach the
[1:10:49] power of God. Listen, I say we ought to
[1:10:51] welcome, Amen, the leadership of the
[1:10:54] Holy Ghost into this church like never
[1:10:56] before. We ought to say, God, you who
[1:10:59] loved us enough to give us a place that
[1:11:01] is not under the taining or under the
[1:11:03] condemnation of men's ideas or or what a
[1:11:06] man thinks, but somebody it'll just say
[1:11:08] what a prophet said. We ought to say,
[1:11:10] "Thank God for it." Amen. We ought to
[1:11:12] say, "Amen." Some of us parents ought to
[1:11:14] be shouting our shoe heels off. Amen. To
[1:11:16] thank God we got a church. Amen. to
[1:11:19] raise our babies in. It ain't a bunch of
[1:11:21] man-made legalism. A ain't a bunch of
[1:11:23] ritualistic ideas, but we're some
[1:11:25] freeborn sons and daughters of God. And
[1:11:28] we don't have a hireling. We have a
[1:11:30] shepherd behind this pullpit who
[1:11:32] preaches the truth of God's word. And it
[1:11:34] don't matter who likes it or who loves
[1:11:36] it. He'll stand on the promises of God
[1:11:38] because this is not a man's church. This
[1:11:41] is the church of the living God where
[1:11:43] the power of God ought to find a
[1:11:45] rightway and the word of God ought to
[1:11:47] find a place of influence. Yes, sir.
[1:11:50] Amen. The sovereignty of the local
[1:11:53] church. Amen. I say that the sovereignty
[1:11:56] of the local church. I know sometimes
[1:11:59] people get to thinking, well, amen, we
[1:12:00] need to watch this and watch that. And
[1:12:02] I'm not, you know me. I'm not all I'm
[1:12:05] not all anti-streaming. I know some guys
[1:12:07] are, but I'm not a baby.
[1:12:12] But at the end of the day, what matters
[1:12:14] in this church is the message.
[1:12:17] It don't matter how somebody does it up
[1:12:18] the road or down the road or across the
[1:12:20] country or overseas in this church. All
[1:12:23] that matters is the message of the hour.
[1:12:25] And I love what the prophet said. He
[1:12:27] said, "Now, we're not asking you to join
[1:12:28] church. We're asking you to come and
[1:12:30] join Christ and be born again. Now watch
[1:12:32] a prophet and go to any church of your
[1:12:35] choice." I tell you that'll make a and
[1:12:37] I'm just going to preach that that make
[1:12:39] you change the way you look at people.
[1:12:41] Amen. When they're coming there by their
[1:12:43] own choice. Come on. You didn't have to
[1:12:45] come here tonight, folks. You didn't
[1:12:47] have to come hear me preach or have to
[1:12:49] come hear these. You don't have to come
[1:12:50] here on Sunday and hear brother Matt.
[1:12:52] Amen. But there's something in your soul
[1:12:54] that's bearing witness with the
[1:12:56] anointing and the atmosphere. Listen,
[1:12:58] then I think we ought to be thankful.
[1:13:00] Amen. That God has given us a church of
[1:13:02] liberty. Amen. To praise him in. He
[1:13:05] said, "Now you now now watch a prophet."
[1:13:07] He wasn't he wasn't he wasn't promoting
[1:13:09] idleness. He said, "You must find
[1:13:11] yourself a good church." Amen. A place,
[1:13:13] a church of your choice. Now listen what
[1:13:15] he says. And there be a royal member of
[1:13:18] the family of Christ until death set you
[1:13:21] free. I don't know about you, but
[1:13:23] brother Matt, Amen. I want to be a royal
[1:13:25] member of the church of the living God
[1:13:28] who he has positionally placed me in the
[1:13:31] local body of Grace Tabernacle. Amen. I
[1:13:33] want to be a royal member. I want to I
[1:13:36] want to pray with you. Amen. I want to
[1:13:37] shout with you. I want to sing with you.
[1:13:39] I want to enjoy the anointing with you.
[1:13:42] What about it, family? Hey, this ain't a
[1:13:44] bunch of paying your dues of religion.
[1:13:46] This is liberty. Amen. To go to the
[1:13:48] house of God and to raise your families
[1:13:51] in the fear and the admonition of God.
[1:13:53] That's what we're here for mainly is to
[1:13:55] get sinners saved. He said, "Then you
[1:13:58] find you a good church somewhere that
[1:14:00] preaches the full gospel and believes in
[1:14:02] divine healing and believes in the
[1:14:04] baptism of the Holy Spirit." Listen. And
[1:14:07] there you find you a good church of your
[1:14:09] choice.
[1:14:11] Now watch what he says. And then settle
[1:14:13] down there. Woo! Glory. Like brother
[1:14:17] Charlie Cox said, "Shopping days are
[1:14:19] over." Amen. Amen. Settle down there and
[1:14:22] be a real servant to Christ.
[1:14:25] You say, "Well, praise God. I'm serving
[1:14:27] Christ, not the church. But as you serve
[1:14:29] one another, yes, sir. Come on. As you
[1:14:32] love one another, you love God. Now,
[1:14:35] I'll say this. The prophet, I'm just
[1:14:37] preaching. So, prophet, give us
[1:14:39] instruction. He said, "Now, they're not
[1:14:41] trying to find the most spiritual
[1:14:42] church." He said, "But the biggest
[1:14:44] church with the biggest crowd, the best
[1:14:45] dressed celebrity." Amen. Where it's
[1:14:47] called better class. And then in that
[1:14:49] church, they'll try to find a minister,
[1:14:51] what they call not too narrow-minded,
[1:14:53] that'll just about let them live any way
[1:14:54] they wish to. and belong to that church.
[1:14:57] Now, you can live that way and belong to
[1:14:59] the church, but not the church of the
[1:15:01] living God because it's not an
[1:15:03] organization. It's an organism. He said,
[1:15:06] "See, the spiritual man on the inside,
[1:15:09] if you'll give him the rightway, now if
[1:15:11] you'll give the spiritual man the
[1:15:13] rightway, he might lead you to a little
[1:15:15] mission somewhere where there's not many
[1:15:17] people, but there is the spirit of the
[1:15:20] living God. For the outside man feeds on
[1:15:23] psychology. Hey, but the inside man
[1:15:25] feeds on the word of God. Amen. Go
[1:15:28] somewhere where they preach the gospel
[1:15:30] and they believe in the word of God and
[1:15:32] they believe in the coming of Christ.
[1:15:35] Amen. Let me just say this. The spirit
[1:15:37] of God will never lead a person to
[1:15:40] something that is established on a
[1:15:42] foundation that is contrary to the word
[1:15:44] of God.
[1:15:46] Come on my get out there. Amen. The
[1:15:49] spirit of God will never lead anybody,
[1:15:52] amen, to something that is contrary to
[1:15:54] the word of God. Well, let me ask you,
[1:15:56] what led you all here? I'll tell you
[1:15:58] what done it. Wherever the carcass is
[1:16:01] there, the eagles will be gathered
[1:16:02] together. What has led people here from
[1:16:04] Pennsylvania and from all over? I'll
[1:16:07] tell you what's done it is the preaching
[1:16:09] of the message of the hour. Hey, and
[1:16:11] I'll say this, we stand on the
[1:16:13] foundation that God is a savior. We
[1:16:16] stand on the foundation that God is a
[1:16:17] healer. We stand on the foundation that
[1:16:20] God is a deliverer. We stand on the
[1:16:22] foundation that God gives the Holy
[1:16:24] Ghost. We stand on the foundation that
[1:16:26] the message of the hour is the only way
[1:16:28] to a rapture. We stand on the foundation
[1:16:31] that one of these mornings between 6:00
[1:16:33] and 9, our loved ones are going to
[1:16:35] appear and our bodies are going to be
[1:16:37] changed. Hallelujah. Hey, why? Because
[1:16:41] we didn't take our own choice. We
[1:16:43] trusted God's choice. Amen. You got to
[1:16:46] make a choice whether you're going to
[1:16:47] submit yourself to a spiritual church or
[1:16:49] a formal church. And I pray before the
[1:16:52] day ever come that this become a formal
[1:16:54] church. We find an altar somewhere and
[1:16:56] pray the icicles out. May this never
[1:16:59] become a formal gathering which is a
[1:17:01] meaningless gathering but may it always
[1:17:03] be a gathering of eagles where the power
[1:17:05] of God can move and lives can be
[1:17:07] changed.
[1:17:09] You got to make your decision. You got
[1:17:11] to take your way with the church that
[1:17:12] was ordained on the day of Pentecost or
[1:17:14] take some man-made creed. And I love
[1:17:16] this quote. He said, "You got to make
[1:17:18] your choice." He said, "Now, you might
[1:17:20] think it's a little despised.
[1:17:23] You might think it's a little despised,
[1:17:26] but it's reliable."
[1:17:28] Woo! Glory, brother Mark. It might be
[1:17:31] despised, but at least it's reliable. If
[1:17:35] it wasn't, Christ wouldn't have ordained
[1:17:36] it. Well, that ought to make you shout.
[1:17:39] If it wasn't reliable, then Christ would
[1:17:41] have never ordained it. If it wasn't so,
[1:17:44] Amen. Paul wouldn't have received the
[1:17:47] Holy Ghost. Now, come on, church. We can
[1:17:49] get so modern. Amen. But sometimes we
[1:17:51] got to go back to the old landmarks and
[1:17:54] remember what was reliable. Amen. Well,
[1:17:57] I might as well preach. Amen. We get so
[1:18:00] modern sometimes we forget what actually
[1:18:02] was reliable. Can I tell you what was
[1:18:04] reliable was when the saints of God
[1:18:06] began to pray and the power of God be to
[1:18:09] fall. And I'll just say this, don't you
[1:18:11] ever become ashamed of what God has
[1:18:14] ordained as a reliable church of the
[1:18:16] living
[1:18:17] God. I remember I remember my
[1:18:20] grandfather. He he was big in old
[1:18:21] trucks. Brother David, big in old
[1:18:23] trucks. No new trucks, no new no
[1:18:25] advancement. 1950s, 1960s Fords, rust
[1:18:28] buckets falling
[1:18:30] apart, holes in the seats, no seat
[1:18:33] belts, me hiding the floor as a kid
[1:18:35] because you're passing troopers and
[1:18:36] there's no but them were reliable
[1:18:38] trucks, brother Emanuel, them were the
[1:18:40] way to go. And I I remember one day we
[1:18:41] was in the in the in the supply store
[1:18:43] and he was in there and this guy just
[1:18:45] bought a brand new F-150 truck and he
[1:18:47] pulled in there and he was bragging that
[1:18:49] thing up and this was back probably in
[1:18:50] the early 2000s so I mean heated seats
[1:18:53] would have been an advancement then. I
[1:18:54] mean, it had all this really nice stuff
[1:18:56] and man, this was the way. And he
[1:18:58] started kind of making fun of my
[1:19:00] grandfather's old 66 red rust, I mean,
[1:19:02] Ford truck out there. And he got to
[1:19:04] talking about it and all of a sudden he
[1:19:06] said, "That truck's more reliable. I'll
[1:19:08] take it anywhere, anytime, any day. I've
[1:19:10] got that truck." And he went out there
[1:19:12] and brother Maddie went in there to
[1:19:13] start and the thing wouldn't start. I
[1:19:14] never will forget it. That truck
[1:19:17] wouldn't start. We climbed up in that
[1:19:18] old 66 Ford. Pat put his foot on the
[1:19:21] clutch, cranked the thing up. He rolled
[1:19:23] the I rolled the window down. I rolled
[1:19:25] the window down and he harded out. But
[1:19:27] it's reliable.
[1:19:30] Come on, folks. Sometimes, Amen. This
[1:19:32] old way of holiness is despised by the
[1:19:34] world, but it's reliable. Come on. Amen.
[1:19:38] Sometimes it's looked down upon to hold
[1:19:40] the standards that you hold. But you
[1:19:42] fathers, when you walk them babies to
[1:19:44] the altar as clean living young people,
[1:19:46] it might have been despised, but it was
[1:19:49] reliable because it was the house of
[1:19:51] God. It was the place where God had
[1:19:53] designed to manifest himself in. Yes
[1:19:57] sir. When you make an investment with
[1:19:58] your money, you don't pick some some fly
[1:20:01] by night firm. Re said no. He said you
[1:20:03] want to find something reliable. And he
[1:20:05] said, I will re recommend to you tonight
[1:20:07] the old reliable institution that was
[1:20:10] founded on the day of Pentecost when the
[1:20:12] Holy Ghost came down to dwell among men.
[1:20:14] It's the most reliable firm that I know
[1:20:16] of to invest your soul and your future
[1:20:20] in eternity in an
[1:20:22] oldfashioned woo, brother Travis. In an
[1:20:25] oldfashioned Pentecostal experience,
[1:20:27] it's been time-tested and proved to be
[1:20:30] the truth and 2,000 years and it hasn't
[1:20:34] changed a bit.
[1:20:37] This Holy Ghost gospel is still paying
[1:20:40] off the same dividends that it paid off
[1:20:43] 2,000 years ago. It'll still keep you
[1:20:45] above sin. It'll still keep you out of
[1:20:48] depression. Come on. Amen. This Holy
[1:20:50] Ghost gospel will give you a song in the
[1:20:52] midnight. This Holy Ghost gospel will
[1:20:55] put a smile on your face when everything
[1:20:57] is giving you a reason to frown. This
[1:20:59] Holy Ghost gospel will cause you to
[1:21:01] shout in the middle of a trial. This
[1:21:03] Holy Ghost gospel will cause you to
[1:21:05] stand in the face of doctors and say,
[1:21:08] "We're going to choose to believe the
[1:21:10] report of Jehovah Rafa because it's
[1:21:12] timeested and it's reliable." I say,
[1:21:15] "Put your family in it." I say, "Put
[1:21:17] your marriage in it." I say, "Put your
[1:21:19] young people in it." I say, "Put your
[1:21:21] ministry in it. Put your ministry in
[1:21:23] this oldfashioned Holy Ghost church of
[1:21:26] the living God."
[1:21:29] Yes, sir. Spiritual church. I'll say
[1:21:32] this, spiritual revelation, it produces
[1:21:35] a spiritual church. I love what the
[1:21:38] prophet said. He said, "The spiritual
[1:21:39] church, it still has the pillar of
[1:21:43] fire. Still has the signs and wonders.
[1:21:46] Still has the same Christ which it
[1:21:48] vindicates all the way from the dying
[1:21:51] lamb in the garden of Eden until the
[1:21:53] second coming of the lamb. Absolutely
[1:21:55] the same yesterday, today, and forever."
[1:21:59] Brother Brham preaches a sermon called
[1:22:00] the uncertain sound. 1 Corinthians 14:8,
[1:22:03] he said, "If the trumpet give an
[1:22:05] uncertain sound,
[1:22:07] then who shall prepare himself to the
[1:22:10] battle?" He said, "Now, you got to have
[1:22:12] the certainty of anything. We got to
[1:22:16] know whether it's right or not." How
[1:22:18] many's ever heard him preach the
[1:22:19] uncertain sound? Preaches it about seven
[1:22:21] times. He said, "Then you say, "Brother
[1:22:23] Brandon, you're sure taking us out on a
[1:22:24] limb. Is there anything that is
[1:22:26] certain?" He said, 'Well, I can stand
[1:22:28] here and lift up list off and read off a
[1:22:30] list of things that's uncertain. Nations
[1:22:32] are uncertain, uncertain, sound, who
[1:22:34] knows what to do. Jobs, politics is
[1:22:37] uncertain, church is uncertain, home
[1:22:39] life is uncertain. What is certain? Is
[1:22:42] there anything that's certain? Yes.
[1:22:44] There's one thing I'll guarantee you is
[1:22:46] certain. That's the word of God.
[1:22:49] Hallelujah. Home life is uncertain.
[1:22:52] Politics is uncertain. Jobs is
[1:22:54] uncertain. Is there anything that's
[1:22:56] certain? Yes. It's called the word of
[1:22:59] God. When you look at that word
[1:23:01] certainty, it is the firm conviction
[1:23:04] that something is the case. It is the
[1:23:06] quality of being reliably true. It is a
[1:23:09] fact that is definitely true or an event
[1:23:12] that is definitely going to take place.
[1:23:14] So, when you have something that is
[1:23:16] certain, it is a fact that it's the
[1:23:19] truth and it will lead you to the
[1:23:21] manifestation of an event. Oh, I might
[1:23:24] as well preach right there. We have the
[1:23:26] message of the hour and it is a fact,
[1:23:28] David Paul. It's the truth. And I'll
[1:23:30] tell you what it'll do. It'll lead you
[1:23:32] to an event. And that event is the
[1:23:34] changing of your body. Amen. Can I say
[1:23:38] this to you? The certainty of the church
[1:23:41] is the message that it preaches and
[1:23:44] teaches. You say, "Why do y'all put so
[1:23:46] much emphasis on the message?" Because
[1:23:48] it's the only thing that's certain.
[1:23:51] Come on. The mood changes. Y'all know
[1:23:54] what I'm talking about. It's Wednesday.
[1:23:56] God bless you all. You pressed over hard
[1:23:58] days and pressed over work to be in the
[1:24:00] house of God. But let's just be real.
[1:24:02] Sometimes it's hard. Sometimes there's
[1:24:04] all the pressures on us and all the mind
[1:24:06] battles. Hey, but thank God the church
[1:24:09] is not certain because of our attitude
[1:24:11] or because of our mood, but the
[1:24:13] certainty of Grace Tabernacle. Brother
[1:24:16] man, I got to say, God bless you.
[1:24:18] There's one thing we can believe when
[1:24:19] we're on our way to church is we're
[1:24:21] going to hear the message of the hour.
[1:24:24] How many can praise God for that?
[1:24:25] There's one thing you're going to hear.
[1:24:27] You're going to hear that God sent a
[1:24:29] prophet. And you're going to hear that
[1:24:30] Jesus Christ is the same yesterday,
[1:24:32] today, and forever. You're going to hear
[1:24:34] that God can save. He can heal. He can
[1:24:37] feel. He can deliver. You're going to
[1:24:39] hear that God can give you a testimony.
[1:24:41] You're going to hear that God is a God
[1:24:42] of a second chance. Listen, the mood
[1:24:44] might change and the music might change
[1:24:47] and the pews might change, but there's
[1:24:49] one thing that'll never change, and that
[1:24:51] is the message that the church preaches
[1:24:53] and the message that we teach. We're not
[1:24:55] teaching a preacher. We're not teaching
[1:24:57] a man. We're teaching Jesus Christ, who
[1:25:00] is the son of the living God, who is the
[1:25:03] head of the church of the living God.
[1:25:07] Yes, sir. The certainty of this church
[1:25:10] is the message of the hour.
[1:25:14] Hallelujah. Hallelujah. Brother said
[1:25:17] five day identifications. He said the
[1:25:19] first message of the church is
[1:25:20] repentance.
[1:25:22] He said that is the church which is the
[1:25:25] mystical body will teach. It will teach
[1:25:27] repentance. Now watch a prophet go to
[1:25:29] Luke 24. And he said unto them verse 46,
[1:25:32] thus it is written and thus it behooved
[1:25:34] Christ to suffer and to rise from the
[1:25:36] dead the third day and that repentance
[1:25:39] and remission of sins should be
[1:25:41] preached. Come on. Not a suggestion,
[1:25:44] brother Kobe. It's a commandment. It
[1:25:47] should be preached in his name among all
[1:25:51] nations beginning at Jerusalem. Watch
[1:25:54] what he said. And ye are witnesses of
[1:25:56] these things. Reverend breaks into it
[1:25:58] again. Paragraph 87. He said he
[1:26:00] suffered, said the scripture. He's the
[1:26:02] one the prophet spoke of. He's the one
[1:26:05] the whole Bible's turned around involved
[1:26:08] around him. Surely he would know what
[1:26:10] ought to be taught.
[1:26:12] Surely he would know what ought to be
[1:26:14] taught and what ought to be done. And he
[1:26:17] said that repentance and remission of
[1:26:20] sins must be preached to all nations for
[1:26:23] a witness beginning at Jerusalem. So
[1:26:26] watch. That's why this church is not a
[1:26:29] Protestant church. It is not a Catholic
[1:26:32] church. It is a full gospel wordborn
[1:26:36] seed of the spoken word sown church of
[1:26:38] the living God. Listen, the second
[1:26:40] message is that Jesus is the king and he
[1:26:44] is alive forever more. Amen. Watch him.
[1:26:46] Go to Matthew 28 28:20. Teaching them to
[1:26:50] observe all things whatsoever I've
[1:26:52] commanded you. And lo, I am with you
[1:26:54] always, even unto the end of the world.
[1:26:57] Hebrews 13:8, Jesus Christ is the same
[1:27:00] yesterday. Brother Joe, today and
[1:27:03] forever. He said, "See, that's the
[1:27:05] message of the church, doing his work,
[1:27:08] proving his resurrection, and giving
[1:27:10] witness."
[1:27:12] Watch him go to Acts 5:32. And we are
[1:27:15] his witnesses of these things, and so is
[1:27:17] also the Holy Ghost, whom God hath given
[1:27:20] to them that obey him. So God gives the
[1:27:24] Holy Ghost, Brother Don, to those who
[1:27:26] obey him. You know why? Because he's got
[1:27:29] to be witnessed. He's got to have
[1:27:32] somebody who can witness what is
[1:27:34] preached and taught in the church is
[1:27:37] more than just a sermon. It's a reality
[1:27:40] in the flesh. Oh, God was manifested in
[1:27:44] the flesh.
[1:27:46] Now, folks, it's getting down there.
[1:27:48] Getting down there pretty close. God was
[1:27:50] manifested in the flesh. In the church,
[1:27:54] not in the pews, not in the sheetrock,
[1:27:57] not in this carpet. Not in this
[1:27:59] microphone. Come on. Not in that
[1:28:01] microphone. Not on any of these
[1:28:03] instruments, but God was manifested in
[1:28:06] the flesh. Come on, church. They may
[1:28:08] never hear you sing a special. They may
[1:28:10] never hear me preach a sermon, but oh,
[1:28:12] may they see that the Holy Ghost is
[1:28:15] returned in human flesh in the bride's
[1:28:18] body.
[1:28:20] Hallelujah. John 14:12, he gives the
[1:28:23] teaching what the church should do.
[1:28:25] Verily, verily, I say unto you, he that
[1:28:26] believeth on me, the works that I do
[1:28:29] shall he do also, and greater works of
[1:28:32] these shall he do, because I go to my
[1:28:35] father. Paragraph 90. That's the message
[1:28:38] of the church. Jesus Christ the same
[1:28:41] yesterday, today, and forever. Are you
[1:28:44] ready for this? Living in the church.
[1:28:47] Hallelujah. Brother Matt living in the
[1:28:50] church. Raised from the dead. The same
[1:28:52] yesterday, today, and forever.
[1:28:54] performing the same works, doing the
[1:28:56] same things that Jesus did. That's the
[1:28:59] message of the church. If the church
[1:29:02] isn't teaching that, it's teaching some
[1:29:04] false theology because that's what Jesus
[1:29:08] commanded them to preach.
[1:29:11] Well, I might as well say it. That's
[1:29:12] more than just an identification, folks.
[1:29:15] That's a definite identification.
[1:29:18] And you know what definite means? It
[1:29:20] means clearly defined. It means exact or
[1:29:23] certain implying something that is
[1:29:25] fixed. It is settled or is known without
[1:29:29] any doubt. Listen, that is a settled
[1:29:32] fact in this church that Jesus Christ is
[1:29:35] the son of God and he's the same
[1:29:37] yesterday, today, and forever. Can I say
[1:29:41] this? And we're without any doubt,
[1:29:43] brother Travis, that our God is the King
[1:29:45] of Kings. He's the Lord of Lords, and he
[1:29:48] is alive forever more. He is right here
[1:29:50] in this building tonight. He's reigning
[1:29:52] over every sickness, over every symptom,
[1:29:54] over every disease, over every problem.
[1:29:57] Jesus Christ, the head of the church is
[1:30:00] here in the flesh of the church of the
[1:30:02] living God. Hallelujah. That last
[1:30:05] message he said is Mark 16. He said, now
[1:30:08] we'll find out what his last message was
[1:30:09] to the church and we'll see then whether
[1:30:11] we're following out his commission. And
[1:30:13] afterward, Mark 16:4, is this okay?
[1:30:16] Afterward he appeared unto them unto the
[1:30:18] 11 said after his resurrection as they
[1:30:20] sat at meat and araided them with their
[1:30:23] unbelief and the hardness of heart. Now
[1:30:26] why? Because they believe not on
[1:30:30] them. They believe not on them which had
[1:30:34] seen him. Yes sir. Oh my. They did not
[1:30:38] believe on them which had seen him after
[1:30:42] he was risen. Amen. So, he did not go
[1:30:46] down, Amen. to the public school and
[1:30:48] appear to them.
[1:30:51] Come on, young people. He didn't go down
[1:30:53] to Walnut Ridge or or or any other
[1:30:55] school and appear, but he appeared in
[1:30:58] you.
[1:31:01] Come on, folks. That's why the church is
[1:31:03] not the building. It's the body. Come
[1:31:07] on. He didn't, brother, brother Mark. He
[1:31:09] didn't appear down there in your school
[1:31:10] in a corporal body. But when you walk in
[1:31:13] there, Jesus Christ, the resurrected
[1:31:15] God, is appearing in that school.
[1:31:17] Brother Joe, wherever you go, he's
[1:31:20] walking in you because you are the
[1:31:22] witness of the church.
[1:31:26] Well, somebody ought to say, "Amen."
[1:31:28] Hallelujah. Amen. It's more than just a
[1:31:30] gathering in a building. It's more than
[1:31:32] just a song on the platform. It's more
[1:31:35] than just a sermon behind the pullpit.
[1:31:37] God was manifested in the flesh.
[1:31:41] What is the church? It's God in the
[1:31:44] flesh. Hallelujah. Somebody seen him.
[1:31:47] Somebody had seen him. Glory. I know
[1:31:51] it's Wednesday, but I'm trying to
[1:31:53] behave. I'm sorry. This ain't just a
[1:31:55] Wednesday night to me. Hallelujah.
[1:31:57] Somebody had seen him. Somebody was
[1:32:00] trying to tell them about it, and they
[1:32:02] did not believe it. If that isn't the
[1:32:04] same thing today, we know he lives. We
[1:32:07] have the witness of his spirit in us. We
[1:32:09] see his power move over the audiences
[1:32:11] and tens of thousands of people and
[1:32:14] discern their thoughts and their hearts
[1:32:16] exactly the way it was here. They don't
[1:32:18] believe it. They didn't believe it then
[1:32:22] and they don't believe it now. They
[1:32:25] believe he died and that settled it. And
[1:32:28] we got some kind of a historical thing
[1:32:30] that some fell raised up a few years ago
[1:32:32] and established a church and wrote a
[1:32:34] catechism. And that's what we hold on
[1:32:36] to. I love a prophet. Don't you, brother
[1:32:39] Joe? That's pagan.
[1:32:43] Woo. Glory. That's why we don't have no
[1:32:46] brochures at the back door.
[1:32:50] Well, I might as well preach. I'm
[1:32:52] feeling good. That's why we don't have
[1:32:54] no That's why we don't have no new
[1:32:55] member programs. And Amen. Let's get
[1:32:57] your information and let's enroll you in
[1:32:59] this program. Hey, how many can testify?
[1:33:02] Every new member you've seen come in
[1:33:03] here at the end of the service, brother
[1:33:05] Matt, give them an opportunity to come
[1:33:06] to Christ. You know why? Because that's
[1:33:10] what Christ ordained the church of the
[1:33:13] living God. I don't care where you go.
[1:33:16] Just go to Christ and be settled down
[1:33:18] under the word of God. But make sure
[1:33:20] you're under the message. Amen.
[1:33:24] Somebody say they got to hear you preach
[1:33:25] or hear another preacher. No, they got
[1:33:27] to hear Christ. See, no. No. I don't say
[1:33:30] the man might have done it. The man
[1:33:31] might have been sincere. But God doesn't
[1:33:34] control his church like that. Now watch
[1:33:37] what he said. He said, "Go ye into all
[1:33:39] the world and preach the gospel."
[1:33:42] Rebraham said, "How many knows what the
[1:33:44] gospel is? Is the power of God to make
[1:33:47] the word act." Yes, sir. The gospel is
[1:33:52] the power of God to make the word act
[1:33:55] what it says it'll do.
[1:33:58] He said, "Preach the gospel to all the
[1:34:00] world." I love this quote. He said,
[1:34:03] "Preach the gospel to all the world.
[1:34:05] Preach the gospel to the white people or
[1:34:07] just the brown, the ya, the black, to
[1:34:09] every creature.
[1:34:12] Preach the gospel to every creature."
[1:34:15] Amen. He said, "Every creature." You
[1:34:17] believe that means that? He said, "I
[1:34:19] seen God baffle a bull one day.
[1:34:23] I seen him cause hornets not to sting. I
[1:34:27] seen him raise up a possum that had been
[1:34:29] laying dead all night." Every creature.
[1:34:32] Come on, folks. That's one of the
[1:34:34] Hallelujah. That's one of the definite
[1:34:36] identifications of the true church of
[1:34:38] the living God is they will believe on
[1:34:41] him who is raised from the dead and they
[1:34:44] will preach the gospel.
[1:34:47] Hallelujah. Somebody say, "Well, I thank
[1:34:49] God for Oh, God, I'm getting trouble."
[1:34:51] Amen. I'll just say this. Thank God that
[1:34:53] every idea don't come behind this pull
[1:34:55] pit. Come on.
[1:34:57] Come on. We might We might as well shout
[1:34:59] hallelujah. Amen. Thank God every fly by
[1:35:02] night idea don't come behind this
[1:35:04] pullpit because it's reserved for the
[1:35:06] gospel.
[1:35:08] Now, I could get off in some heavy areas
[1:35:10] here. I'll just keep on moving. every
[1:35:12] creature. Listen, because the gospel
[1:35:15] will take effect upon anything that you
[1:35:17] ask.
[1:35:19] My brother Xavier, the gospel will take
[1:35:21] an effect upon anything you ask. You say
[1:35:24] that's wrong, brother Brandham. It isn't
[1:35:26] wrong because Jesus preached the gospel
[1:35:28] to a tree.
[1:35:32] He cursed a tree at its root and said,
[1:35:35] "From this day on, no man eat from you."
[1:35:37] And the gospel was preached to that
[1:35:39] tree. and the tree obeyed the gospel. He
[1:35:44] that believeth and is baptized shall be
[1:35:46] saved, but he that believeth not shall
[1:35:48] be damned. And these signs shall follow
[1:35:50] them that believe in my name. They shall
[1:35:53] cast out devils. They shall speak with
[1:35:55] new tongues. They shall take up servants
[1:35:57] serpents. If they drink any deadly
[1:35:59] thing, it shall not hurt them. And they
[1:36:02] shall lay their hands on the sick
[1:36:06] and they shall recover. So that after
[1:36:10] the Lord had spoken to them, he was
[1:36:12] received up into heaven and he sat on
[1:36:14] the right hand of God and they went
[1:36:17] forth. Come on, they went forth and
[1:36:20] preached everywhere.
[1:36:22] The Lord working with them and
[1:36:24] confirming the word with signs
[1:36:27] following.
[1:36:28] Oh God, they went everywhere preaching
[1:36:32] the gospel because they knew if it could
[1:36:35] just be preached,
[1:36:38] it would take an effect upon anything
[1:36:40] that God asked.
[1:36:42] Oh my, I'm hurrying. Look here. Mark 16
[1:36:46] is the definite identification of the
[1:36:49] believing church. He said that's the
[1:36:51] commission of the church. That's the
[1:36:52] real believing church. The church of the
[1:36:54] living God is pre-born spirit of God. It
[1:36:58] don't need any denomination.
[1:37:00] They follow the king. They don't have to
[1:37:03] take the people's things. They're
[1:37:04] freeborn. Now, who's going to preach it?
[1:37:09] Who's going to preach it? He said, God
[1:37:11] is able to take the ignorance. He's able
[1:37:14] to rise stones to the children of
[1:37:16] Abraham. God can do whatever he wants to
[1:37:19] because he's God. Can I tell you this?
[1:37:21] Another thing the church will teach and
[1:37:23] will preach is divine healing. Amen.
[1:37:27] I'm I'm not crazy. I'm the spirit world.
[1:37:30] Divine healing. Listen, another thing
[1:37:33] the church will teach will be divine
[1:37:35] healing, which is the message of the
[1:37:38] church. Somebody say, well, amen. I just
[1:37:40] quoted Matthew 10. He said, let's read
[1:37:42] it. When he had called unto him his 12
[1:37:44] disciples, he gave them power over
[1:37:47] against unclean spirits to cast them out
[1:37:51] and to heal all manner of sickness and
[1:37:53] all manner of diseases. Let me just say
[1:37:56] what a prophet said. He said the first
[1:37:58] commission to his church was to preach
[1:38:01] divine healing. Can I say this? He said,
[1:38:03] "If the power of God ever puts forth
[1:38:06] another church, it'll be another
[1:38:08] Pentecost, another book of Acts will be
[1:38:11] wrote behind it because it's the church
[1:38:14] of God." Jesus said, here we go, "I am
[1:38:17] the vine and ye are the branches. You
[1:38:19] cannot bear fruit in yourself." I love
[1:38:22] how he says this, Brother Brian. He
[1:38:24] says, "But I throw my own self."
[1:38:28] I throw my own self into the branch, and
[1:38:31] what kind of fruit did it bear? These
[1:38:33] signs shall follow them that believe.
[1:38:36] The second church rises up. The mystical
[1:38:39] body of Christ will have the same signs.
[1:38:41] Yet a little while in the world shth me
[1:38:43] no more. Yet ye shall see me. For I will
[1:38:46] be with you, even in you. Are you ready
[1:38:49] for this? In every branch,
[1:38:52] in every branch unto the end of the
[1:38:56] world. Come on. Can I say this to you,
[1:38:58] daddy? He's in you.
[1:39:01] Can I say it to you, mama? He's in you.
[1:39:04] Can I say it to you, grandparents? He's
[1:39:06] in you. Listen, you ain't got to wait,
[1:39:08] husbands or wives. Amen. Till the altar
[1:39:10] gets open. Amen. To pray for one
[1:39:12] another. You can lay your hands on them
[1:39:14] right there and say, "Satan, you've gone
[1:39:16] as far as you're going to go. You've
[1:39:18] tormented and afflicted as long as
[1:39:20] you're going to afflict." I believe God.
[1:39:24] Come on. I believe God, Sister Eve, I
[1:39:26] believe God is a healer. I believe this
[1:39:28] church is standing on the foundation.
[1:39:31] They shall lay their hands on the sick
[1:39:33] and they shall recover.
[1:39:37] That's not a suggestion. That's a
[1:39:40] definite identification.
[1:39:43] Now, the church also must teach baptism.
[1:39:46] Yes, sir. So, it's going to teach
[1:39:49] repentance and remission of sins,
[1:39:51] brother. It's going to teach that Jesus
[1:39:54] is the king and he's alive forever more.
[1:39:57] Brother, it's going to teach, Amen, the
[1:39:59] baptism of the Holy Ghost. It's going to
[1:40:01] teach divine healing. It's going to
[1:40:03] teach water baptism. Listen, the power
[1:40:05] of the church, Amen, comes from the
[1:40:08] authority that it's under. Are you
[1:40:11] hearing me? This is a bibleelving
[1:40:13] church. We are not under the authority
[1:40:16] of Bishop soandso on Mark 16. We are
[1:40:19] under the authority of Jesus when he
[1:40:22] spoke Mark 16.
[1:40:25] Brother said, "We don't have any power,
[1:40:26] but we have authority." Don't take
[1:40:28] power. Someone said, "You got any
[1:40:29] power?" "No, but I got authority." You
[1:40:32] take a little policeman stand out here.
[1:40:33] He wears a uniform. He has got a hat too
[1:40:35] big for him. Sets down over his ears. He
[1:40:37] hasn't got power to stop
[1:40:40] nothing. But let him walk out here and a
[1:40:43] car coming down the street with a 300
[1:40:45] horsepower engine and let him raise up
[1:40:47] that hand and watch the I mean, watch
[1:40:50] the brake slide. why he hasn't got no
[1:40:53] power, but he's got authority. And when
[1:40:56] a man or woman is anointed, hallelujah,
[1:40:59] with the baptism of the Holy Ghost, he
[1:41:02] might not be able to read his name in
[1:41:03] box cariz letters with education, but he
[1:41:06] has got an authority from God that he is
[1:41:09] a son of God. Let him take authority
[1:41:12] from God and stand and say, "Stop."
[1:41:15] Well, why don't you do it tonight,
[1:41:17] church? That devil's running towards
[1:41:18] your family. He's running towards your
[1:41:20] health. He's running towards your
[1:41:22] babies. Rise up in the authority of the
[1:41:25] church of the living God and say,
[1:41:28] "Stop. Stop, devil. You've come as far
[1:41:31] as you're going to come. You've rolled
[1:41:33] as hard against us as you're going to
[1:41:35] ride. We know who we are."
[1:41:40] Somebody shout that devil out of here.
[1:41:42] Somebody praise God in the house of God.
[1:41:45] Hallelujah. I'm talking about Jesus.
[1:41:48] He's alive forever more. I'm talking
[1:41:51] about the King of Kings and the Lord of
[1:41:54] Lords. And he's in this building tonight
[1:41:56] to tell that devil, stop.
[1:42:01] You've gone as far as you're going to
[1:42:04] go.
[1:42:08] No, I ain't backing up to that devil.
[1:42:10] He's gone as far as he's going to go.
[1:42:15] Yes, sir. He's gone as far as he's going
[1:42:19] to go. He's rode free as long as he's
[1:42:22] going to ride.
[1:42:24] Get out, devil.
[1:42:27] Get out, devil. This ain't an
[1:42:29] organization. This is the church of the
[1:42:32] living God.
[1:42:36] Satan's wheels will slide and so will
[1:42:38] his breaks.
[1:42:40] something will take place because he's
[1:42:42] been given authority by the Holy Ghost.
[1:42:45] In my name, they shall cast out devils.
[1:42:50] Amen. That's why the devil hates this
[1:42:52] kind of preaching, brother Mark, is
[1:42:53] because it gives no place to the devil.
[1:42:57] Come on. We're not making any room for
[1:42:58] the devil.
[1:43:01] I'm not backing up. We're not making any
[1:43:03] room for the devil. We're not giving him
[1:43:05] one little corner. We're not giving him
[1:43:07] one little cimeter of this assembly.
[1:43:10] This church belongs to God. It belongs
[1:43:13] to the power of God. It belongs to the
[1:43:15] word of God. And anywhere that devil
[1:43:17] finds himself, we're going to stand as
[1:43:19] authoritative sons and daughters of God
[1:43:22] under a scriptural God-given authority
[1:43:24] and serve that devil eviction. Notice
[1:43:27] you've gone as far as you're going to
[1:43:29] go.
[1:43:32] [Applause]
[1:43:33] You say it's written over in St. John, I
[1:43:35] think if he abide in me and my word in
[1:43:37] you. See, the word abides in you.
[1:43:44] There it is. The word abides in you.
[1:43:51] Brother Jonah, am I reading that right?
[1:43:53] The word abides in you. You mean it
[1:43:57] don't just visit you at the altar?
[1:44:00] Come on, folks. It don't just visit you
[1:44:02] when you're singing or when the pastor's
[1:44:04] preaching, but the word abides.
[1:44:08] I can't sing, brother Tom, but I would
[1:44:10] right now. He abides.
[1:44:12] He abides. The word abides in you. See,
[1:44:16] then ask what you will
[1:44:19] and it might be done.
[1:44:22] Ask what you will, Brother Morgan, and
[1:44:24] it shall be done. Because it's not you,
[1:44:28] it's the word that's in you.
[1:44:32] The word maketh intercessions. I'm not
[1:44:35] going to preach all night, but I sure
[1:44:36] could. The word that's in you. Amen. In
[1:44:39] the beginning was the word, and the word
[1:44:41] was with God, and the word was God, and
[1:44:44] the word was made flesh. The word was
[1:44:47] made flesh and dwelt among us. God was
[1:44:51] manifested in the flesh. He was preached
[1:44:54] on and believed on by the Gentiles and
[1:44:57] he ascended into heaven. But folks, I'm
[1:45:00] closing. This ain't a headless body.
[1:45:03] This ain't a headless body. Just because
[1:45:06] he's not here in a corporal body does
[1:45:08] not give the devil right away to run
[1:45:11] over our families and to wreck our
[1:45:13] health and to wreck our nerves. He is
[1:45:15] here in the form of the Holy Ghost.
[1:45:21] Hallelujah.
[1:45:23] Now it was word made flesh and dwelt
[1:45:26] among us. And now in the return of the
[1:45:31] Holy Spirit, he is bringing the word in
[1:45:36] us.
[1:45:38] Can I say it to you? And it's abiding in
[1:45:42] there,
[1:45:46] brother. I feel like shouting right now.
[1:45:49] The word is abiding in you.
[1:45:55] Did I read that right? Yes, sir. Then
[1:45:57] it's not you that speaks.
[1:45:59] Come on. It's the word itself coming
[1:46:02] out.
[1:46:05] Come on, church of the living God.
[1:46:07] That's why the walls of Jericho don't
[1:46:09] scare us. That's why the Red Sea don't
[1:46:12] stop us. That's why the lion's den don't
[1:46:14] bind us. That's why Philistines don't
[1:46:16] make us scared. Because we know we have
[1:46:19] come here under the anointing of the
[1:46:21] spoken
[1:46:23] word. Can I close on this? It's time to
[1:46:26] quit crying. It's time to
[1:46:29] speak. It's time to quit crying. It's
[1:46:32] time to speak. Come on, church of the
[1:46:34] living God. It ain't time to cry. You've
[1:46:36] cried and cried and cried and cried and
[1:46:39] cried. And ain't nothing changing. Ain't
[1:46:41] nothing going to change until you change
[1:46:43] their position.
[1:46:47] Well, I'll just cry. Amen. I believe in
[1:46:49] crying, but sometimes you got to start
[1:46:51] speaking.
[1:46:55] You got to speak.
[1:46:57] I'm trying not, young people, but
[1:46:58] y'all's pulling that Red Sea sermon
[1:47:00] right out of Are you hearing me? You got
[1:47:02] to speak sometimes. Sometimes you got to
[1:47:05] realize that it's time to dry your
[1:47:07] tears. Sometimes you got to realize what
[1:47:10] David said. Hallelujah. He said,
[1:47:12] "Weeping may endure for the night." Yes,
[1:47:15] sir. Yes, sir. But joy is coming in the
[1:47:18] morning. Hallelujah. I say to every son
[1:47:21] and daughter of God, you've had your
[1:47:23] midnight hour. You've had your weeping
[1:47:25] hour. You've had your prayer meeting
[1:47:27] hours. But joy is coming in the morning.
[1:47:31] The word is in the bride. And the bride
[1:47:33] has the mind of God. She has the sayith
[1:47:36] the Lord. And she speaks.
[1:47:40] She speaks.
[1:47:43] It's not you that speaks.
[1:47:48] It's the word itself coming out.
[1:47:52] So
[1:47:53] it the word will perform sir the work.
[1:48:01] Stand on your feet and give God praise
[1:48:02] tonight.
[1:48:05] So
[1:48:05] it the
[1:48:07] word will speak out of you, the church.
[1:48:13] Hallelujah. Can I say it? That's not
[1:48:16] uncertain, folks. There's no uncertain
[1:48:18] sound about that.
[1:48:22] There's no uncertain sound in my mind
[1:48:24] about John 14:12. Amen. There's not one
[1:48:27] uncertain sound in my mind about Mark
[1:48:29] 16. There's not one uncertain sound in
[1:48:32] my heart about Matthew 28:20. There's
[1:48:35] not one uncertain sound in my heart
[1:48:37] about Malachi 4.
[1:48:40] The word abides in you.
[1:48:47] Can I say this to you?
[1:48:49] I got here too late.
[1:48:53] But it's time to go up against your
[1:48:55] enemy.
[1:48:58] You've hid from him and backed up.
[1:49:02] And old Mr. Devil,
[1:49:04] if we could just if we could just get
[1:49:06] together and make
[1:49:08] a we could just get together and make a
[1:49:10] peace deal.
[1:49:16] I don't want to get in
[1:49:18] politics cuz I know I know some of y'all
[1:49:21] seen
[1:49:22] it. Trump and Zalinsky sitting there on
[1:49:26] the worldwide
[1:49:28] platform. Anybody see that?
[1:49:32] trying to work out a peace deal about
[1:49:34] the
[1:49:36] enemy. And Zalinsky looks over at Trump
[1:49:38] and
[1:49:39] says, "Well, your country and your
[1:49:43] conditions and this is going to happen
[1:49:45] to you
[1:49:47] all." Like Trump, what he said. He said,
[1:49:50] "You ain't got no right to talk about
[1:49:51] our country."
[1:49:54] Said, "Leave our country alone. We'll
[1:49:55] take care of it."
[1:49:57] And you know that's what the devil tell
[1:49:58] and I'm not but you that's what the
[1:50:00] devil tells you sometimes. The devil
[1:50:02] says now if you take a stand I'm going
[1:50:04] to tell you what's going to happen to
[1:50:05] you and your family and if you if you
[1:50:07] come against me I'm going to tell you
[1:50:09] what's going to happen to them grandb
[1:50:10] babies.
[1:50:12] But it's time to square your shoulders
[1:50:14] back like a son of God.
[1:50:17] Brother Jared, it's time to stand there
[1:50:19] and look that devil square in the face
[1:50:21] and say you ain't got no business
[1:50:22] talking about our church.
[1:50:26] You ain't got no business talking about
[1:50:28] what's going to happen. I'm a son of
[1:50:30] God. I'm a daughter of God. I'm under a
[1:50:32] covenant of God. And there ain't no
[1:50:34] devil can change the fact that God is in
[1:50:37] his word and his word is abiding in his
[1:50:40] church.
[1:50:44] How many believes he's a never failing
[1:50:45] presence?
[1:50:47] How many believes the church, the living
[1:50:49] God will cast out devils?
[1:50:53] How many is ready not to say, "Devil,
[1:50:55] you've gone as far as you're going to
[1:50:56] go."
[1:50:58] [Music]
[1:51:02] Stop. Stop.
[1:51:05] [Music]
[1:51:07] Come on, folks. We've made it too
[1:51:09] complicated. We got to figure out some
[1:51:12] special word or some special way that
[1:51:14] we're going to speak and stop the
[1:51:17] stop.
[1:51:19] Remember one time, brother Tim Puit told
[1:51:21] me, we was over at the youth camp there
[1:51:23] and some of y'all was probably there
[1:51:24] that year. I think it was 2019. There
[1:51:27] was one demon manifestation after
[1:51:28] another after another after another. I
[1:51:31] think there was eight or nine or 10 in
[1:51:32] one
[1:51:33] [Music]
[1:51:34] night. Went to my they took me out to my
[1:51:37] room and I come back the next morning
[1:51:39] and sitting there talking to brother Tim
[1:51:41] and he said he said, "Well, there was
[1:51:43] one last chief demon that raised its
[1:51:44] head and he said that devil wasn't going
[1:51:47] to leave. believe it wasn't going to
[1:51:48] move. He said they were screaming and
[1:51:51] and hollering and putting pictures up
[1:51:54] and everything and and we believe in
[1:51:55] those
[1:51:57] things. He all know, brother Tim. I
[1:51:59] said, "Brother Tim," I said, "What in
[1:52:01] the world?" He said, "Well, a son of God
[1:52:03] just got to go take his position as a
[1:52:05] son of
[1:52:06] God." I said, "Well, what'd you do?" He
[1:52:09] said, "I just walked down there as a son
[1:52:11] of God and looked that spirit in the
[1:52:13] eyes and said, "Go.
[1:52:16] [Music]
[1:52:18] I said, "What happened?" He said, "It
[1:52:20] went."
[1:52:23] [Applause]
[1:52:25] He said, "It went." Now, y'all know what
[1:52:27] I'm talking about. People trying to work
[1:52:29] stuff up and they try to make something
[1:52:30] name. No. Go. Come on. You say, "Well,
[1:52:34] that's a seasoned preacher." Well,
[1:52:35] you're a seasoned believer. Come on. He
[1:52:38] don't have one Holy Ghost and you got
[1:52:40] another. The same Holy Ghost that Paul
[1:52:42] had is the same Holy Ghost you got. It's
[1:52:44] time to look that devil in the face and
[1:52:46] say, "Go. Go, boy. Go. Pack your bags.
[1:52:50] Get out of here. You've lived here as
[1:52:51] long as you're going to live. This is
[1:52:53] the church of the living
[1:52:57] God." Riding back home one year from
[1:53:00] youth camp on the bus and and a and a
[1:53:02] young girl on the and the a young girl
[1:53:04] there on the on the bus. Amen. Riding
[1:53:06] the back. A demon manifestation right
[1:53:08] there. And I'm not saying these things
[1:53:09] are scary. I'm telling you this your
[1:53:10] position. Demon raised his head right up
[1:53:13] there. Amen. crawling up and down on the
[1:53:15] back of the bus. And I'm telling you
[1:53:16] these things cuz I got a whole sermon on
[1:53:18] here. Maybe I'll get to it next time. We
[1:53:20] don't have to fear. That's right. This
[1:53:22] is not the the Bible says this is the
[1:53:24] house of God, right? The church of the
[1:53:26] living God. This is not the household of
[1:53:29] fear. It's the household of faith. You
[1:53:33] ain't got to fear this devil. He's a
[1:53:35] whipped puppy.
[1:53:37] He's a defeated being.
[1:53:39] Demon crawled up on the back. Brother
[1:53:41] went back there. He laid his hand over
[1:53:43] on that young girl. I never will forget
[1:53:44] it. He said, "Satan, in the name of
[1:53:46] Jesus, I adure you as the son of God,
[1:53:49] come out of this child of God and leave
[1:53:51] her alone in the name of Jesus." He got
[1:53:53] off that bus at a rest stop and that
[1:53:55] demon, Brother was right. He said, "Then
[1:53:57] demons go float in different places." He
[1:53:59] said, "I walked in the bathroom." He
[1:54:00] said, "I was washing my hands." And he
[1:54:02] said, "Right behind me, that demon
[1:54:04] appeared." And he said, "That demon
[1:54:05] appeared in a physical form and looked
[1:54:07] at me and said, now you cast me out and
[1:54:10] you're here, but your family's at home
[1:54:12] by
[1:54:14] itself." I I get chills thinking about
[1:54:16] it. He turned around. He said, "But in
[1:54:18] the name of the Lord Jesus that I cast
[1:54:20] you out by, you go to my house and
[1:54:22] you'll meet that God there." And
[1:54:24] brother, that brother Jared, that demon
[1:54:25] flew like that out of there. Amen.
[1:54:29] I'm not crazy, folks. It's a reality. We
[1:54:33] have a certainty.
[1:54:36] We're going to preach the gospel and
[1:54:38] sick are going to be healed. We're going
[1:54:40] to preach the gospel and devils are
[1:54:41] going to be cast out. Sister Nish, we're
[1:54:44] going to preach the gospel and miracles
[1:54:45] are going to take place.
[1:54:48] [Music]
[1:54:50] It's the certainty of the church of the
[1:54:54] living God. Y'all have heard me testify
[1:54:56] that I can't get off of them. Stand
[1:54:58] there in New Zealand. I won't give you
[1:54:59] the whole testimony, but laid my hand on
[1:55:01] a girl, laid my hand on her and prayed
[1:55:03] for her, and that demon spoke right out
[1:55:04] of her and said like that and said, I
[1:55:07] said, "I cast you out in the name of the
[1:55:09] Lord, by the word of the Lord." And that
[1:55:10] demon spoke out and said, "What word?"
[1:55:13] Come on, brother. Matt, I reached over
[1:55:15] and grabbed a Bible and I handed it over
[1:55:17] to a sister and I said, "Since you laid
[1:55:19] this Bible on that girl's body and she
[1:55:21] laid that Bible over on her body and I
[1:55:23] said, "In the name of the Lord Jesus
[1:55:24] Christ, who wrote that word, sent me
[1:55:27] here to preach that word and I cast you
[1:55:29] out in the name of Jesus." And before
[1:55:31] these eyes, I watched the power of God
[1:55:33] deliver that young girl. And she stood
[1:55:35] up on her feet and she began to say,
[1:55:37] "I'm free. I'm free. I'm free.
[1:55:42] Hallelujah. This ain't an organization.
[1:55:45] This is the church of the living God
[1:55:47] with the message of God.
[1:55:51] And he's right here in this building
[1:55:53] tonight. Almighty God, we bow our hearts
[1:55:55] in your presence,
[1:55:57] Lord. Lord, these are not just church
[1:56:00] members. Lord, these are not just human
[1:56:02] beings taking up space on planet Earth.
[1:56:06] Lord, these are not just citizens of a
[1:56:08] state and of a county living in a home.
[1:56:11] But Lord, these are your predestinated
[1:56:13] children. These are the sons and
[1:56:16] daughters that you forneew from before
[1:56:18] the foundation of the world and sent
[1:56:21] them into this age to testify of your
[1:56:25] greatness, of your majesty, of your
[1:56:28] authority, of your power, of your
[1:56:30] anointing, of your love, of your grace,
[1:56:33] of your mercy, of your kindness, of your
[1:56:36] faithfulness, of your goodness. Now,
[1:56:40] Father, we lay our we lay our hands at
[1:56:43] your feet tonight, Lord. We surrender
[1:56:45] ourselves before you tonight. Lord, not
[1:56:48] coming before an idol, but coming before
[1:56:51] the living God, who is the head of this
[1:56:54] living church. Father, your prophet said
[1:56:57] the word of God would revolve right out
[1:56:59] of God into sons and daughters of God.
[1:57:02] Now, Lord, I know these young people are
[1:57:04] facing enemies. These families are
[1:57:07] facing enemies.
[1:57:09] Lord, bodies here tonight that's got
[1:57:11] sicknesses in them are facing enemies.
[1:57:14] But Lord, I stand here tonight as a
[1:57:16] minister of the gospel of Mark
[1:57:19] 16. As a son of God, as a minister of
[1:57:21] the church of the living God, we stand
[1:57:24] here tonight shouldertosh
[1:57:26] shoulder recognizing the word is in
[1:57:29] us. And it's not us speaking, but it's
[1:57:32] the word speaking itself out of us.
[1:57:36] Lord, by your by your grace and your
[1:57:37] anointing, we take our position tonight
[1:57:40] and we look at the enemy and say,
[1:57:43] "Stop.
[1:57:44] Stop. You've gone as far as you're going
[1:57:46] to
[1:57:47] go." Father, I pray tonight that every
[1:57:50] believer here tonight, Lord, if there's
[1:57:52] one that's been beat down by the enemy,
[1:57:56] oppressed, struggling, Lord, Father, may
[1:58:00] this be their liberation hour. Lord, may
[1:58:03] this be the hour they realize their
[1:58:05] position in the church of the living
[1:58:09] God. Lord, we thank you for this
[1:58:11] message. We thank you for the power of
[1:58:13] God. We thank you for the
[1:58:16] revelation. Lord, these are the people.
[1:58:20] These are the people that you said would
[1:58:23] be strong and they would know you and
[1:58:26] they would do great exploits.
[1:58:30] Father, move among us
[1:58:33] tonight. Maybe some right here tonight
[1:58:35] suffered in this building, in their
[1:58:37] bodies. We say, "Stop,
[1:58:39] Satan, in the name of
[1:58:42] Jesus." In the name of
[1:58:44] Jesus. In the name of
[1:58:48] Jesus, they shall lay their hands on the
[1:58:51] sick and they shall
[1:58:53] recover. They shall cast out devils in
[1:58:56] my name.
[1:58:58] the church of the living God. God was
[1:59:02] manifested in the flesh. I want you
[1:59:05] right now to lay your hand on someone
[1:59:07] standing next to
[1:59:08] you. We're going to fulfill Mark 16
[1:59:11] right here
[1:59:12] tonight. You are the church of the
[1:59:14] living
[1:59:16] God, the people. You know your God. You
[1:59:20] know him
[1:59:21] tonight. You know him tonight.
[1:59:24] As we pray right now, I want you to use
[1:59:27] your voice as the church of the living
[1:59:30] God. And I want you to join in prayer
[1:59:32] with us. And let's pray one for another.
[1:59:35] Almighty God, Lord, as a as a universal
[1:59:38] body of believers, as a mystical body of
[1:59:41] Christ. Lord, we gather here tonight on
[1:59:43] this Wednesday evening service to
[1:59:45] worship you and Lord to honor you in the
[1:59:48] power of your resurrection. Lord, to
[1:59:50] acknowledge what you've done in this
[1:59:51] generation by fulfilling your word and
[1:59:54] vindicating the promises of it. Lord, we
[1:59:56] don't gather here just to fulfill a
[1:59:58] religious duty tonight, Lord. Father,
[2:00:00] we're not here to be entertained or
[2:00:02] we're not here to be seen or to be
[2:00:03] heard, but Lord, we're here to do
[2:00:05] business with the devil. We're here to
[2:00:07] take our position in the word of God.
[2:00:10] We're here to believe you, Lord. We're
[2:00:11] here to worship you, oh God. Now, Lord,
[2:00:13] as these believers have fulfilled the
[2:00:15] promise of your word, Lord, I didn't say
[2:00:17] it. Brother Brandham didn't say it. Our
[2:00:19] pastor didn't say it, but Lord, you said
[2:00:21] it. You said they shall lay hands on the
[2:00:23] sick and they shall recover. Father, as
[2:00:25] these Holy Ghost filled believers are
[2:00:27] fulfilling the word, you said, "I am the
[2:00:29] vine. Ye are the branches." Lord, you
[2:00:31] said, "I will throw myself over into
[2:00:34] them." Lord, you have thrown the
[2:00:36] promises of your word into the flesh of
[2:00:38] these believers here tonight. So, Lord,
[2:00:40] as they lay their hands upon one
[2:00:42] another, may the spirit of God begin to
[2:00:44] move throughout this building, oh God.
[2:00:46] Lord, may it begin to remove sicknesses,
[2:00:48] oh God. Lord, may it begin to rebuke
[2:00:50] discouragements, Father. May it begin to
[2:00:52] rebuke oppressions and depressions,
[2:00:54] Father. May the power of the Holy Ghost,
[2:00:56] the same spirit that raised my Lord from
[2:00:58] the dead, may it begin to overshadow
[2:01:01] this audience here tonight. Father, may
[2:01:03] your word begin to discern the spirits
[2:01:05] and the thoughts and intents of the
[2:01:06] heart. Oh God, may you move tonight for
[2:01:09] our families, Lord. Father, you see our
[2:01:11] sister Leah there at home, Lord. Amen.
[2:01:13] Recovered from this operation. and the
[2:01:15] may the may the power of the Holy Ghost
[2:01:18] may the angel of God go to her home
[2:01:19] right now. Father, you see our our
[2:01:22] brother Randall, our sister Joyce there,
[2:01:24] Lord. May the angel of God go to their
[2:01:26] home, Lord. Sister Sherry, Father, Lord,
[2:01:28] all the believers that are not here
[2:01:30] tonight for whatever reason, Lord. May
[2:01:32] the power of the Holy Ghost go to them,
[2:01:34] Lord. Father, for the sick ones, Lord,
[2:01:36] Lord, may this be the day their disease
[2:01:38] ends. May this be the day the sickness
[2:01:40] stops, Father, for those that are
[2:01:42] growing cold on you, Lord. Father, may
[2:01:44] the power of God search them out in the
[2:01:46] land today. Lord, may you shake them, oh
[2:01:48] God. May you shake them from the cares
[2:01:50] of the world. Lord, we're here as a
[2:01:52] body, Lord. We're here as a family of
[2:01:54] believers, oh God, to do to do the word
[2:01:56] of God, to do the will of God. Oh, bind
[2:01:59] us together, Lord. May you knit this
[2:02:01] body of believers, Father. May you knit
[2:02:03] Grace Tabernacle, Amen, so strong
[2:02:06] together in the love of God that there
[2:02:08] would be no room for the devil. There
[2:02:10] would be no room for the devil in
[2:02:11] relationships. there would be no room
[2:02:13] for the devil and friendships. Oh God,
[2:02:15] Father, bind this church together, Lord.
[2:02:18] Bind us together under the oposes of the
[2:02:20] word. Fill us with the love of God.
[2:02:22] Lord, Father, may every joint supply,
[2:02:25] Lord. May every member of the body be
[2:02:27] accounted for. Lord, may there not be
[2:02:29] one growing discouraged or weary in
[2:02:31] their position. Father, may they
[2:02:33] recognize in their position they're the
[2:02:35] most powerful force on the face of the
[2:02:37] earth. And Lord, out of their position,
[2:02:39] chaos has room. Father, tonight Lord,
[2:02:42] may we stay in our positions, God. May
[2:02:44] you bless our members, oh God. May you
[2:02:46] bless the musicians, Father. May you
[2:02:48] bless the song leaders, Lord. May you
[2:02:50] bless our pastor, dear God. Oh God, may
[2:02:53] you pour out your anointing upon him
[2:02:54] like never before to stand behind this
[2:02:57] pullpit and to preach the definite
[2:02:59] identification of the church of the
[2:03:01] living God. Oh father, I pray for every
[2:03:03] Sunday school teacher, every officer,
[2:03:05] every deacon, every trustee, Lord. Amen.
[2:03:08] every every believer, every member of
[2:03:10] this assembly, Father, for every
[2:03:11] preacher, Lord. Oh God, I bind the
[2:03:14] spirit of discouragement. I bind the
[2:03:16] spirit of heaviness, Lord. Father, these
[2:03:18] men of God that carry the ark of a
[2:03:20] covenant upon their shoulders, Father,
[2:03:22] may you visit them, Lord. May you
[2:03:23] encourage them. May you reveal yourself
[2:03:25] to them, oh God. Lord, I pray for our
[2:03:27] young people in this church, Lord.
[2:03:29] Father, may they see, Lord, that they
[2:03:31] have seen you, oh God. They have seen
[2:03:33] you in your appearing. They have seen
[2:03:35] you in the revelation of your word. Now
[2:03:37] Lord, may you fill every fiber of their
[2:03:38] being, oh God, may you may you make them
[2:03:41] such a such a trophy of your grace, such
[2:03:43] a walking billboard, Lord, that when
[2:03:45] they go to their schools or wherever
[2:03:47] they go, Father, may they see the church
[2:03:49] of the living God on display in the
[2:03:51] flesh of our young people, Lord. Father,
[2:03:54] may this be more than just an assembly
[2:03:56] of gatherings of people, Lord. May this
[2:03:58] be a place of the greater works, Lord.
[2:04:01] Father, may this be a place.
[2:04:04] Hallelujah. Lord God, may this be a
[2:04:06] place where the power of God falls. Oh,
[2:04:09] it may be
[2:04:10] despised. The world may drive by and
[2:04:12] laugh at us here on the side of a dirt
[2:04:15] road, but it's reliable, Lord. Thank
[2:04:19] you, Lord. It's reliable. Lord, you give
[2:04:22] us a place that's reliable. It's a place
[2:04:25] we can come no matter what we're going
[2:04:28] through.
[2:04:30] can just get in your
[2:04:32] presence. We know you'll speak,
[2:04:35] Lord. We know you'll
[2:04:37] speak. We know you'll
[2:04:42] speak.
[2:04:43] Hallelujah.
[2:04:45] Hallelujah. God, may we never take for
[2:04:47] granted what you've given us here,
[2:04:49] Lord. Father, may it never become common
[2:04:52] to us, Lord. May it never just become
[2:04:55] going to church. May it never become
[2:04:58] just going over there on Sunday or I'll
[2:05:00] go old Wednesday. Oh God, don't ever let
[2:05:02] it become that way or this is a
[2:05:05] spiritual
[2:05:06] church. It's a spiritual
[2:05:09] place. May it ever remain that
[2:05:12] Lord.
[2:05:14] Hallelujah.
[2:05:16] Hallelujah. I wonder tonight just want
[2:05:18] to raise your hands and say thank you
[2:05:21] Lord. Thank you Lord. I'm not preaching
[2:05:24] grace tabernacle is the mystical
[2:05:27] universal body, but it's a part of it. I
[2:05:29] wonder how many tonight just say thank
[2:05:31] you, Lord. Thank you for this
[2:05:34] assembly. Thank you for our pastor,
[2:05:37] Lord. Thank you for the Holy Ghost
[2:05:39] leadership that you've placed here,
[2:05:41] Lord. Thank you for these men of God,
[2:05:43] these ministering brethren in the
[2:05:45] church. Thank you for them, Lord. Thank
[2:05:48] you for them, God. Thank you for these
[2:05:51] singers. Thank you, Lord.
[2:05:53] Hallelujah. Oh, we're blessed, friends.
[2:05:58] The message of the hour has blessed us.
[2:06:00] I wonder tonight you just take a moment
[2:06:02] and praise him right now. I know I know
[2:06:04] it's Wednesday and I know it's getting
[2:06:06] late, but just praise him for just a
[2:06:07] moment right now. Lord, I thank you.
[2:06:10] Lord, I thank you for a place that no
[2:06:13] matter what I'm going through, I'll hear
[2:06:16] the message.
[2:06:18] No matter what kind of report I just
[2:06:20] received from the doctor, I'll hear that
[2:06:22] you're still Jehovah Rafa. I'll hear
[2:06:24] that you're still a healer and I worship
[2:06:28] you. Oh, I know you may be discouraged
[2:06:31] tonight, but I wonder, could you just
[2:06:32] lift your hands up to him and say,
[2:06:34] "Lord, I worship you. I praise you
[2:06:36] tonight, oh God, and magnify you in the
[2:06:40] church of the living God. Praise is
[2:06:43] comely to those worship is due unto your
[2:06:46] name.

[2:17:34] no
[2:17:36] way forever he is
[2:17:42] faithful and
[2:17:45] he will make a
[2:17:49] road when
[2:17:51] [Music]
[2:17:54] you know I
[2:17:58] know God will make
[2:18:03] away. For I know
[2:18:06] God will make a way when there seems to
[2:18:13] be no way.
[2:18:16] Ever he is
[2:18:20] faithful and will make a ro when you
[2:18:26] bear a heavy load.
[2:18:31] I
[2:18:33] know God will make a way.
[2:18:39] Must have felt strange to end up
[2:18:42] stranded between an army and the sea.
[2:18:47] Must have felt forsaken. Wondered why
[2:18:50] God wasn't all he said he'd be. But when
[2:18:56] your back's against the

[2:19:44] Amen. Won't you give the Lord a hand
[2:19:46] clap of praise tonight?
[2:19:49] How many say, "I am the church of the
[2:19:51] living God."
[2:19:53] Go ahead and say it. I am the church of
[2:19:56] the living God. Go ahead, everybody, and
[2:19:59] just say it one time. I am the church of
[2:20:02] the living God. And my head is Jesus
[2:20:05] Christ.
[2:20:07] Ain't that right? We're God's church.

[2:20:21] message?
[2:20:26] Amen. I think it's powerful. Amen. Just
[2:20:29] to remind you who you are. I we
[2:20:32] sometimes you just have to have the the
[2:20:34] courage to stand and look at the devil
[2:20:35] and tell him who you are. We spend
[2:20:38] enough time listening to him tell us who
[2:20:39] we are. All kinds of lies that he tells
[2:20:42] us. You're a failure. You're a nobody.
[2:20:44] You're a quitter. You're a you're a
[2:20:45] backslider. everything he can tell you.
[2:20:47] But you can look right at and say, "I am
[2:20:48] the church of the living God. I was
[2:20:51] called by God before the foundation of
[2:20:53] the world. My name was written on the
[2:20:54] lamb's book of life." And what it can
[2:20:57] never be erased. Nothing you can do to
[2:20:59] ever take it off. Nothing I can do to
[2:21:01] ever mess it up. I'm the church of the
[2:21:04] living God. I'm the bride of Jesus
[2:21:06] Christ. Isn't it wonderful to be a part
[2:21:08] of that? I think we I think we need to
[2:21:11] just be who we are, a Holy Ghost fil
[2:21:13] body of believers. Amen. You love the
[2:21:15] Lord tonight. Won't you give him another
[2:21:17] hand clap of praise? Can we sing this?
[2:21:20] Can we sing this song just before we go?

[2:23:23] holy power while I was laying in a dead
[2:23:26] man's grave. It's like

[2:23:38] fire shut up in my bones. Fire shut up
[2:23:43] in my
[2:23:44] bones. Well, some people get offended
[2:23:48] because I leave a child. They say too
[2:23:52] much emotion and there's too much moving
[2:23:54] about. But don't tell me to be silent or
[2:23:58] to sit down in my pew. Cuz if you met

[2:24:22] in my
[2:24:23] bones. Well, some people get offended
[2:24:27] because release and shout. They say too
[2:24:30] much emotion, there's too much moving
[2:24:33] about. But don't tell me to be quiet or
[2:24:37] to sit down in my pew. I got the blood
[2:24:40] of Jesus and I'll be shouting through.
[2:24:44] It's like
[2:24:46] fire shut up in my bones. Holy Ghost and
[2:24:51] fire.

[2:25:26] Well, you may as well praise the Lord.
[2:25:27] We're in church anyhow. There's
[2:25:29] something on the inside of me that's
[2:25:30] burning, looking for a way out. You
[2:25:33] remember what it was like when you gave
[2:25:34] your heart to the Lord. I say, Lord,
[2:25:36] restore unto me the joy of my salvation.
[2:25:40] when he took me out of sin's chains and
[2:25:42] delivered me from out of bondage. When
[2:25:44] when I thought I all the things of the
[2:25:46] world I couldn't get off of me, but in
[2:25:48] the presence of God, all of a sudden, he
[2:25:49] took them away and set my soul on fire.
[2:25:52] It makes me want to praise God. Somebody
[2:25:53] say, "Praise the Lord." Turn around and
[2:25:55] tell somebody, "I've got a fire that's
[2:25:57] been shut up in my bones." We We may as
[2:25:59] well let it out.
[2:26:02] We may as well let it out. Brother Mark,
[2:26:04] you may as well. Somebody, you feel like
[2:26:06] saying hallelujah, you ought to be able
[2:26:07] to say hallelujah. You ought to be able
[2:26:09] to say, "Praise God." You ought to be
[2:26:11] able to be bound by the devil. You ought
[2:26:12] to be able to lift your hands freely in
[2:26:14] the house of God and say, "Praise God.
[2:26:17] Thank you for delivering me. He's a
[2:26:19] mighty God and he's worthy to be
