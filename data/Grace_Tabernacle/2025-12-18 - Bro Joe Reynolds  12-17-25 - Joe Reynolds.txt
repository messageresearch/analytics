And we just thank you for opportunity to come and Lord, just together in this in this place [music] to fellowship. And Lord, to have communion with you. And Lord, what a wonderful thing it is, Lord, to be able to see one another and [music] and shake one another's hands. And Lord, to fellowship one with another, but Lord, it's even a greater time, Lord, that we could come and have communion with you. And Lord, that we could hear from your word and it would be an encouragement to us, Lord, a healing to our bodies, Lord. We just ask you tonight, God, that you would move upon each one, Lord, every need, every hand that's raised, [music] Lord, that you could use our brother tonight to be a a minister, Lord, that would just use the the word of the Lord to be a help to all of us. And Lord, we just give you the liberty to speak. We ask you to come now in Jesus name. [music] Amen. I bless your name. not your in your [singing] mouth.

Lord, we thank you, Lord, for such [music] a time as this, Lord, that we could gather around and feel your presence so rich and pure, Father, like in our trapped in humanity, Lord, our shortcomings and so many failures, Lord God, we come together in unity tonight, Lord, to rally around your precious anointing and your precious word, Lord. Lord, Lord, we pray, Lord God, that the window of heaven will open up tonight, Lord God, and come down and have an experience with us one more time, Lord God, and let our hearts burn within, Lord God, as we have fellowship one with you, Lord God. For what service would it be if you wasn't invited, Lord? People want to give you a special invitation to come, Lord, and have your own way here this evening, Lord God, as we commit this time into your hands, Lord, as we were sanging this precious song, Lord. Lord, we couldn't help to feel your presence as you come by our way, Lord God, to let us know you're in the midst and good things happen when you come around, Lord God. I pray Lord God, miracles begin to happen, things begin to change. Lord God, when Jesus came by, the dead was raised, the lame walk, the deaf could hear, Lord God. Lord, I believe that you're the same yesterday, today, and forever, Lord. And we ask you once again, Lord, to come bless this portion of the service, Lord God. Lord, we pray, Lord, that you'll bless our the pastor, Lord, and for his labors, Lord. We pray that you'll bless Brother Mark for his labors tonight, Lord, coming and giving his heart, preparing the service, Lord. Now we ask you to come Lord and speak to a vessel once again and anoint the ears to hear in Jesus Christ's wonderful name. And the believer says, "Amen." Do you love the Lord? Ain't it certainly good to be in his presence this evening? [snorts] Hallelujah. I invite you to Romans chapter 4. We like to minister tonight on the worship of the true believer. The worship of the true believer. Romans chapter 4:E 16. Therefore, it is of faith that I might be of grace to the end the promise might be sure to all the seed, not that that only which is of the law, but to that also which is of the faith of Abraham, who is a father of us all. As written, I've made thee a father of many nations, before him whom you believed, even God, who quickened the dead, and call those things which be not as though they were. Who against hope believed in hope, that he might become the father of many nations, according that which was spoken, according to that which was already spoken, so shall thy seed be. And being not weak in faith, he considered not his own body now dead when he was about a hundred years old. Neither yet the deadness of Sarah's womb. He staggered not at the promise of God through unbelief, but was strong in faith the revelation of the will of God, giving glory to God. He was magnifying God in the face of opposition and being fully persuaded that what he had promised he was able also to perform. Hallelujah. Can you can you just bow your heads one more time? If you have a need upon your heart, just make it known to the Lord. Oh Lord sees every one of your hands tonight. Lord Jesus, once again, Lord, we ask you to come in a special way. Anoint your word. We read, Lord God, anoint every hand that was risen. Lord God, we commit this time into your hands one more time in Jesus Christ's wonderful name. And the bride says, God bless you. You can have your seats tonight. I thought it was striking how Paul would say here that who against hope he believed in hope that he might become the father of many nation according to that which was spoken. and the verse before calling those things which be not &gt;&gt; as though they were. &gt;&gt; And nobody knew how Abraham felt as much as Abraham knew how he was feeling. And brother Brandham, brother Roy said like this, the greatest enemy that I have is not brother Roy or brother Phil or brother Morgan, but it's Joe Reynolds. And he said William Mary and Brandham. He's a guy I'm trapped in. He's a guy I deal with every day. And that was the same way Abraham wasn't exempt from humanity. He knew exactly how much pressure was on his life. But he chose rather deny the facts of life. &gt;&gt; He refused to hear the the negative report of hell. Amen. And just to believe God's promise and to prove God's word was true. It may seem impossible, but go ahead and give God praise. &gt;&gt; Amen. And that's exactly what Abraham did. He staggered not at the promise of God behel, but was strong in faith. Believe in the revelation of the will of God in HIS OWN LIFE OUTSIDE of how he felt, regardless of his feelings, regardless how dead Sarah's womb was or how old Abraham was. Amen. He staggered not at the promise of God because he wasn't leaning to his own understanding. He was taking God's promises over his feelings and believing God's word. Abraham didn't ask his body for permission. &gt;&gt; Abraham didn't negotiate with science. &gt;&gt; Amen. He did he he didn't consult his fear or his doubts. He just simply believed &gt;&gt; and he worshiped. &gt;&gt; What an effective soldier. Wasn't going to let present conditions stop his praise. For the Bible tells us, let everything that has breath. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. God gives the promises of his word and he will prove it or bring it to pass regardless of feelings or how old Abraham was. He sets the boundaries and he anoints the believer's footprints to prove his word. You believe that? Let me read you this quote. But the Bible says, "But Abraham didn't stagger anywhere at all. He believed that God was able to perform. Perform just simply means to bring past &gt;&gt; that which he had promised. So it didn't didn't matter how he felt or what he could see &gt;&gt; or the conditions. He magnify God. The worship of a true believer magnifies God in the face of opposition. &gt;&gt; Amen. And he goes on. He said God would prove his word no matter how long it took. But instead of getting weaker &gt;&gt; each time like we are prone to do, ABRAHAM GOT STRONGER ALL [screaming] the time. HIS BODY WAS DECLARING one thing. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah, brother David. But a revelation was proving something else IN THE FACE OF OPPOSITION. SAYS, "EXTRA, EXTRA, READ ALL ABOUT IT. MY WIFE'S GOING TO HAVE A BABY RIGHT IN THE FACE OF OPPOSITION." &gt;&gt; Besides getting weaker as his body was, his soul was getting stronger. &gt;&gt; Oh, I think we can do it tonight. &gt;&gt; Amen. He says, he says, "Tomorrow it'll be miracle." That was God. Listen to what brother would say. That was God. THAT WAS GOD in Abraham. For he KNOW THAT GOD PROVED ALL OF HIS words to be sold. If his children would only take his word. &gt;&gt; Who's his children tonight? So he can prove it. &gt;&gt; Sister Eve, listen to this tonight. His children only take HIS WORD. SO GOD, HE can prove it by you. That's the only way he can prove his word. HE DOESN'T PROVE IT BY UNBELIEVERS. They can't be proved. THEY ARE UNBELIEVERS. THEY ARE DOUBTERS. BUT IT'S NOT TO UNBELIEVERS. IT'S TO HIM THAT BELIEVES. &gt;&gt; And if HE COULD FIND SOMEBODY WHO WILL BELIEVE HIS WORD, HE WILL PROVE HIS WORD BY YOU. HALLELUJAH. And sometimes sickness and things happen to us that way that God can prove himself. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. God sets the bounds and we are here to allow him to prove it that he's the same yesterday, today, and forever. Exodus 23 and30 says, "By little and little I will dry them out before thee until they be increased and inherit the land. I will set thy bounds from the Red Sea, even to the sea of the Philistines, and from the desert unto the river. For I will deliver the inhabitants of the land in your hand. and thou shalt drive them out before thee. All he needs is his children to take his word. &gt;&gt; Amen. He needs hands tonight. &gt;&gt; Come on, WORSHIPPERS. HE NEEDS FEET. &gt;&gt; HE NEEDS BODIES. HE NEEDS BELIEVERS. &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. HEY, BUT HE SAYS, BROTHER BENJI, he said, I'm going to set the bounds. THIS IS NOT THAT YOU'RE GOING TO DECREE IT. I'M going to decree this. I'm going to set MY WORD. I'M GOING TO SET MY COVENANT. I'M GOING TO PROVIDE THE ANOINTING. I'M GOING TO GIVE YOU EXACTLY what you have need of TO OVERCOME IT. I JUST NEED A BODY. &gt;&gt; I JUST NEED SOMEBODY TO YIELD. I JUST NEED SOMEBODY TO SAY, "I WILL GO. I'LL TAKE IT. I'LL RUN." &gt;&gt; OH, CHURCH. I think Brother Jared, I believe it's the END TIME. IT'S RIGHT at the END OF ALL TIMES. IT AIN'T TIME TO STOP. IT'S TIME TO SPRINT. AMEN. When I run relay, WHEN I WAS IN HIGH SCHOOL, I KNOW I DON'T LOOK like I could do that, but I once did. AMEN. AMEN. WE RUN A RELAY AND we didn't WE PUT THE FASTEST MAN &gt;&gt; at the end &gt;&gt; cuz you know the the ONES THAT WAS GOOD BUT WASN'T the best, THEY RAN THE RACE GOOD, BUT THEY NEEDED THAT SPRINTER at the end &gt;&gt; that they COULD REACH OUT AND HAND IT TO ANNIAH. NIGHT COULD TAKE OFF. &gt;&gt; AMEN. And that THEIR COACH KNOWS, AMEN, WE may be a little behind, but we have what we need IN THIS LAST DAY. AMEN. TO sprint and run and be ABLE TO TAKE IT BY FORCE. OH, I'M GOING TO GET AHEAD OF myself tonight. But God is good, church. Amen. This is the end. &gt;&gt; I'm Who's ready to run? &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. God sets the bounds. &gt;&gt; He needs a body. He needs a believer. &gt;&gt; Boy, I just feel his presence tonight. I just feel his presence. He just needs a believer &gt;&gt; that he can hand it off to &gt;&gt; and prove his word. &gt;&gt; Can I say it like this, PASTOR MATT? HE NEEDS A BODY tonight to prove his word. HE NEEDS SOMEBODY TO TAKE GOD'S word and he's going to prove it through you. &gt;&gt; Joshua and Caleb, after all they seen, Satan thought he silenced those believers. THEY MAGNIFIED GOD IN THE face of opposition. GOD SET THE BOUNDS AND HIS soldiers was there to enforce it, to prove his word. Remember, Brother Brenham would say it like this. He put the moon as a guard. &gt;&gt; He said with a gun over his shoulder and he sets the boundaries of the sea. And the moon, a body, holds the sea. HE STOOD BY THE BANKS AND WATCHED THE ANGRY WAVES TRYING TO lick it out. But the moon says, "Hold your peace. GOD SETS THE BOUNDARIES and I'm the guard." Hallelujah. Amen. The opposition couldn't silence them &gt;&gt; because the worship doesn't need permission. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; It was a negative party. &gt;&gt; It was a negative party until worship showed up. [crying] &gt;&gt; Can I say like this? Worship doesn't check the atmosphere. &gt;&gt; It changes it. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. that changes it. They didn't deny the giants wasn't there. Oh, y'all. They still they seen it. They didn't deny that they wasn't there. THEY JUST REFUSE ALLOWED TO SILENCE THEIR PRAISE. &gt;&gt; WHEN THE PORCH SAYS NO, THEY SAID YES. &gt;&gt; WHEN THE PORCH SAYS THEY COULDN'T GO, THEY SAID I CAN. I'M MORE THAN ABLE TO TAKE THE LAND. WHEN SATAN SAID RETREAT, THEY SAID [screaming] CHARGE BECAUSE THEY WASN'T LOOKING AT WHAT THEY COULD SEE. THEY WAS LOOKING BY FAITH AND SAY GOD GAVE THE PROMISE AND HE ONLY NEEDS A worshipper &gt;&gt; to prove God's word to be true. &gt;&gt; And when the enemy comes in like a flood, &gt;&gt; he's going to lift up a brine. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. a mark, &gt;&gt; a Martha Morgan. He's going to lift up a standard, a body to prove his word to be true. &gt;&gt; What is the mystery of the thunder of God thundering out? &gt;&gt; Brother, I would say like this, Sister Sandy, he said, "In Jessville, Indiana, we need thousands of lived voices. &gt;&gt; The thunder of God thundering out." Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; The thunder is only a noise. It's a sound. It's a sound effect &gt;&gt; of a power of another force. &gt;&gt; It's only THE SOUND EFFECTS THAT a greater power is here. &gt;&gt; The thunder is THE EVIDENCE THAT GOD'S NOT DEAD, HE'S ALIVE. WHAT WE NEED TODAY IS THOUSANDS OF LID VOICES THUNDERING of God thundering out. He said thundering out sweetness. Lord help us. &gt;&gt; Sounding out holiness. God help us. &gt;&gt; Sounding out purity. &gt;&gt; SOUNDING OUT UNDEFILED LIVES. &gt;&gt; THUNDERING OUT. I'M READING WHAT THE PROPHET SAID. WALKING AROUND IN THE EARTH TODAY without a blemish. Yes, sir. Real Christians. That's the thunder against the enemy. WHAT WE NEED TODAY IS THOUSANDS of live voices. The mystery of the thunder is the worship of the believer. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Joshua and Caleb was live voices that hell cannot silence &gt;&gt; their praise. Extra extra. Read all about it. That's my land. &gt;&gt; That's my land. I saw it. I stood there. The promises was real. The negative sounds was trying to drown out the promise of God. He sent those spies over. 10 came back was drowning out trying to silence the promise of God. Oh, but brother Ram says, "Brother Roy, he'll never leave us without a witness." Right in the midst of all the negativity, here come a Joshua and Caleb. &gt;&gt; They couldn't silence and praise. The negative DIDN'T SILENCE AND PRAISE. IT JUST AMPLIFIED IT. &gt;&gt; Abraham refused to let the trials he was facing steal his praise. Satan tries to break your silence or break your worship. There's a slogan says, "A cracked bail can still make sounds, but a broken bail is silent." Satan's goal is to break you &gt;&gt; to silence your worship. &gt;&gt; He tried this when the God gave him the okay to torment Job and afflict his body. And he done everything he could to Job to try to get Job to curse his God. Can I say it like this tonight, Sister Tammy? We can be checked, &gt;&gt; but a true believer can never be put in checkmate. &gt;&gt; I know we've heard the story many times of the picture in the L and how that they walked by and and the picture that spoke thousands of words was it was it was if you walked by it looked like the discouraged man. He was cracked. He was beating. Amen. It looked like there was no hope. And it took a messenger to come down. They had the experience to come down and look at that picture that looked like there was no hope. THAT LOOKED LIKE SOCIETY. THERE WERE NOBODY TO BE SAVED IN LATER OA. AMEN. But it TOOK A MESSENGER WITH A MESSAGE FROM THE KING TO COME DOWN AND LET US KNOW. AMEN. WE MAY BE CRACKED. &gt;&gt; WE MAY BE AMEN. WE MAY BE BURIED BY THE THINGS THAT WE CAME INTO THIS WORLD shaped into, &gt;&gt; but we're not in checkmate. &gt;&gt; And he COULD PROVE THIS BY Job as a devil brought everything he could up against Job. Bear with me a few minutes. Job be to lose his cattle. Job be to lose his family. Job be to lose his houses. Job be his land be to be burnt up. One trial after another. Wave after wave, blow at the blow. You could touch his body, try to make him break. SATAN TRIED [screaming] TO BURY JOB. &gt;&gt; But there was a worshipper inside of Job. A warrior &gt;&gt; that can never be broken. &gt;&gt; Amen. Hell didn't know this, &gt;&gt; BUT GOD DID. &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. AMEN. GOD WHO'S RICH IN MERCY. SATAN TRIED TO BURY HIM. Hell can never mute &gt;&gt; our worship &gt;&gt; and praise. &gt;&gt; It only amplifies it. Hell was trying to bury Job. &gt;&gt; But all along they was planning a testimony. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. AMEN. JOB. THEY THOUGHT THEY WAS BEARING Job until a place where Job, Brother R would say, Job walked over there and looked out the curtains of time and he seen out there the beautiful trees, the green leaves whipping in the wind. Oh church, he might have been cracked. He might have been scarred. HIS SPIRIT MIGHT HAVE BEEN TORN. AMEN. But Job was never in checkmate. HE WAS NEVER BROKEN. THEY THAT THAT WAS SILENCE the worshipper within him. And when he BEGAN TO SEE RESURRECTION, WHEN HE BEGAN TO SEE GOD IN NATURE, THERE WAS SOMETHING INSIDE OF JOB THAT BEGAN TO SCREAM OUT IN HIS CALAMITY. &gt;&gt; AMEN. A TESTIMONY WAS BORN. The Lord giveth and the Lord taketh away. BLESSED BE THE name of the Lord. Hallelujah. I KNOW [screaming] MY REDEEMER. I KNOW MY REDEEMER LIVES. The king had one more move &gt;&gt; and that one more move was restoration for Job &gt;&gt; to prove his word. &gt;&gt; Exodus 10 and 24 says Pharaoh called unto Moses and said, "I'm hurrying. Go you serve the Lord only. Let your flocks and your herds be stayed. Let your little ones also go with you." And Moses said, "Thou must give us all the sacrifices." And Moses said, "Thou must give us also sacrifices and burnt offerings that we may sacrifice unto the Lord our God." Our cattle also shall go with us. There shall not be a hoof left behind. For therefore must we take the serve the Lord our God, and we know not with what must serve the Lord until we come together. We will not. In other words, Moses telling him, "Amen, I'm not compromising my worship. &gt;&gt; I'm not compromising my praise. &gt;&gt; AMEN. I'M NOT LEAVING a hook behind. You're not taking my sacrifice cuz my worship has TO COME WITH SACRIFICE." AMEN. MOSES WAS TELLING HIM, "I'VE BEEN I DIDN'T COME DOWN HERE TO COMPROMISE WITH THE DEVIL. I'M NOT GOING TO COMPROMISE WITH MY PRAISE OR MY WORSHIP. WHEN TRIALS COME, I'M NOT COMPROMISING my praise. &gt;&gt; In the face of opposition, &gt;&gt; we've been through it. &gt;&gt; You've been through it. &gt;&gt; We've been through some great opposition. I've been through my Gethsemane. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. And I'm still standing. &gt;&gt; IT'S THE PROOF THAT I CAN BE CHECKED. BUT NOT BROKEN. &gt;&gt; NO MATTER WHAT, THIS BAIL CAN NEVER BE BROKEN. &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. AMEN. The in the face of opposition, I'm not compromising my praise. &gt;&gt; I'm going to clap. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; I'm going to stop. &gt;&gt; I'm going to run. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; I'm going to dance. &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. NO MATTER WHAT IT TAKES, I'M NOT GOING TO COMPROMISE MY WORSHIP. HELL'S AGAINST US. HELL'S TRYING TO BURY YOU. BUT HE FAILS TO REALIZE HE'S ONLY A TESTIMONY. &gt;&gt; AMEN. He's not destroy. &gt;&gt; [applause] &gt;&gt; in the face of opposition. He said he lost his family. He was scraping and BLOOD was in a bad Abraham could feel the dead &gt;&gt; AND THE LEAVING HIS NATURAL BODY STOOP SHOULDERS WAS GOING BACK TO THE EARTH. &gt;&gt; He didn't feel like praising GOD &gt;&gt; ALL THE NEGATIVE THINGS &gt;&gt; the worship of a true believer. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. I'm not compromising my &gt;&gt; I THINK IT'S STRENGTHEN GOD HELP ME. I THINK IT'S THAT WE CAN FIND SCRIPTURE OF THIS MAGNITUDE TO LET US KNOW THE PROPHET WOULD COME AND TELL US of a prayer LINE WHEN GOD CAME DOWN AND SPOKE THROUGH HIS VOICE AND HE SAID THIS IS NOT WILLIAM BRAND. I'M USING HIS VOICE. I'M USING HIS BODY. AT THE SAME TIME, HE WAS TELL &gt;&gt; lifting your hands. Keeping your feet &gt;&gt; don't compromise. &gt;&gt; I'm praising God. Come on, brother. Come on. &gt;&gt; I tell you tonight, forgot I didn't have a mic. [panting and gasps] They told me a little pale. Think so many times, how many I lost my place. &gt;&gt; How many times on a Wednesday or Sunday morning, hell comes in all fours? If it ain't broken, it is now. &gt;&gt; If the car won't start, it won't now. &gt;&gt; If you got a flat tire, it will it will be then. Trouble problem, trials, troubles, persecution, family troubles, work problems. Was he trying to do crack? &gt;&gt; Break you to the point of no return. But all the time WE HAVE A GOOD SHEPHERD that knows everything and all things work for the good of THEM THAT LOVE GOD ARE CALLED ACCORDING TO HIS PURPOSE. And all that dumb devil's done IS PLANNING A TESTIMONY. &gt;&gt; The doctor SAID YOU WOULD NEVER HAVE IT. THE DOCTOR SAID YOU CAN NEVER GET OVER IT. &gt;&gt; I SAY TONIGHT, GET READY. &gt;&gt; Go ahead. Sew some shoes for the baby. Go ahead, get some baby clothes. Start preparing. Amen. YOU MAY BE CRACKED BY THE DOCTOR'S REPORTS, but it ain't his last move. The king still has one more move. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. So, how am I going to do it? The worshipper, the worship of a true believer in the face of doctor's report says, "I don't care what the doctor says, I'm healed. I don't care what they say. I'm going to see. I DON'T CARE WHAT THE DOCTOR SAID. I'M GOING TO HEAR AGAIN. &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. Do you love him? &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. I'm not leaving a hook behind. It's the worship of the believer that's proven his word. Look, Satan, hell was having a ball cuz Jesus was on a 4-day journey in another direction. And they buried Lazarus &gt;&gt; and they was having such a good time. But when Jesus came by, &gt;&gt; lightning struck and thunder sounded. And though he was dead four days and the skin words was destroying his body, &gt;&gt; Jesus said Lazarus, &gt;&gt; THEY WAS BURIED. THOUGHT THEY WERE DESTROYING THE LAZARUS. THOUGHT THEY WAS GOING TO BREAK HOMES. Thought they was going to cause confusion. Thought they was going to keep PEOPLE FROM GOING TO CHURCH. THEY THOUGHT THEY WAS GOING TO HAVE FAMILY PROBLEMS AND CHURCH splits &gt;&gt; all along. They was only planning a testimony. &gt;&gt; Lazarus, come forth. Oh, there wasn't enough grave. There wasn't enough grave clothes to hold him. There ain't no grave going to hold that body down. [sighs] Hallelujah. Go ahead and tell the devil tonight. You're trying to bury me because the science says this. You're trying to bury me because my feelings tells me this. Telling a preacher, a hillbilly preacher, not very good at it at all, is telling you tonight that God says it ain't over yet. &gt;&gt; GOD SAYS WHAT HE MEANT FOR EVIL, I'm going to turn it to good. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. GOD SAID HE'S TRYING TO BREAK YOU, BUT YOU'RE NOT BREAKABLE. GOD SAYS HE HE'S TRYING TO BURY YOU, BUT HE'S ONLY PLANNING &gt;&gt; that I can prove my word and it'll be a testimony. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. [sighs] [panting] Oh, I can go through I got evangelistic type message. I told brother Matt in the back room, but we could go through characters after characters in the Bible. They tried because two great good men of God casting demons out, destroying Satan's kingdom said, "You know what? Let's catch up with them guys. Let's throw them in the dark prisons. Let's bury them in the prison." [sighs] They tried to break them. They took everything they had around. They took their clothes. [sighs] They took their cell phones. They took them away from the family. They took them away from the church. They put them in chains and shackles and put them under the prison. They was tormented beyond torment. But they they did everything they could to to break them. But sister Leah about the midnight hour about the midnight hour &gt;&gt; they thought they go they would break through and silence them. The very thing that Satan was using to silence them became a platform for God. &gt;&gt; ABOUT THE MIDNIGHT HOUR ALL HELL THOUGHT THEY had them. &gt;&gt; Satan was planning a burial. Amen. &gt;&gt; At midnight, HE WAS PLANNING A FUNERAL PROCESSION at midnight. But God scheduled a revival. &gt;&gt; SATAN TRIED TO BEAR THEM, BUT IT WAS ONLY PLANNING A TESTIMONY. SATAN THOUGHT THE CHANGE WOULD end the message, but it only amplified. They started a jail house revival. What they meant for evil. &gt;&gt; They got two men down there. THEY STRIPPED THEM OF ALL EARTHLY POSSESSIONS. They took their Bibles AWAY FROM THEM. THEY TOOK EVERYTHING. THEY STRIPPED THEM. [sighs] OH, but there was something down inside of them. They could break. They could crush them and crack their flesh and crack their spirits. But there was something down in Paul and Silas about the midnight hour. It was so dark. Looked like hopes are all gone. It looked like the picture that stood in the L Satan standing over that defeated man. Amen. And the the picture says checkmate. Amen. BUT THAT THAT OLD MESSENGER BEGIN TO SCREAM, "IT'S A LIE. &gt;&gt; It's a lie. YOU'RE NOT BOUND, PAUL. YOU'RE NOT BOUND, SILAS. &gt;&gt; Could you imagine? &gt;&gt; They couldn't see nothing in front of them. Amen. It was so dark. THERE WAS NOBODY AROUND THEM. THEY WEREN'T LOOKING FOR NO MAN'S PRAISE. They weren't looking for no man glory about the midnight hour. the worship of a true believer &gt;&gt; begin TO SCREAM OUT AND THEY BEGIN TO PRAISE GOD AND MAGNIFY GOD IN THE FACE OF SUCH darkness &gt;&gt; and their praise they they put them in there to silence them &gt;&gt; but it only amplified &gt;&gt; a believer's praise &gt;&gt; it only amplified it only made it greater And they they threw two men in to silence two messengers. And when they begin to praise and they begin to worship God, those chains that seem to bite them, BEGIN TO DROP POWERLESS behind them as they begin to praise their Lord. Tell the devil tonight, you didn't bury me. &gt;&gt; You planned me. &gt;&gt; Oh, for such a time as this. AMEN. HE BURIED ME TO SILENCE ME AND BREAK ME. But the worshipper within them arose and a testimony was born. Hallelujah. You believe it? [sighs] You can imagine how much it tormented hell. What are they doing? I thought I had him. I was throwing everything at them. I bound them. Tuck their clothes. Tuck their fellowship. Tuck everything. What are they doing? They're lifting their hands. &gt;&gt; THEY'RE PRAISING GOD. THEY DON'T CARE WHO'S PREACHING. They don't care who's singing. They don't care who their neighbor is. The true WORSHIPPER WORSHIPS GOD IN SPIRIT. And in truth, he magnifies God. &gt;&gt; And about the midnight hour, they couldn't see it. But it wasn't long, church. They began to feel, [gasps] they begin to hear the thunder, THUNDERING OUT THE POWER OF ALMIGHTY GOD. Their praise was so amplified, it began to shake the prison. &gt;&gt; It began to shake the prison walls. &gt;&gt; I say it could happen. What Satan thought he was doing is changing tonight. &gt;&gt; Can you see it? &gt;&gt; Can you see it? Oh, the hotel house begin to rock. &gt;&gt; The hotel house begin to praise. The jailers begin to worship. [sighs and gasps] There was a revival. They was preparing for a funeral possession. God says, "Oh, just wait a minute. &gt;&gt; Come on, &gt;&gt; Paul. I got this. &gt;&gt; Silas, I have this, brother David. Don't worry about it. I GOT THIS. I GOT THIS. SATAN IS TRYING to crack you. He's trying TO CRACK ME TONIGHT. HE'S TRYING TO CRACK you tonight. BUT I'VE GOT GOOD NEWS. THE king still has one more move. And that MOVE IS DECLARED BY THE MESSAGE OF THE HOUR THAT YOU CANNOT be broken. This ship amen that they CAN BE BATTERED BUT IT CAN NEVER be sunken. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Can I do tell another testimony? A testimony was born. There's a time we've used this so much. There was three Hebrew children that was dull in the master's hand. They made a decree and these three young men decided, I ain't compromising on my worship. I'm not compromising on my praise. And they BEGAN TO GET SO MAD. It made hells so mad. and they begin TO SCREAM, "I'M TIRED OF THESE HOLY ROLLERS. &gt;&gt; I'M TIRED [screaming] OF THEIR THEIR VICTORY. I'M TIRED OF THEIR SHOUTING. &gt;&gt; I'm tired of their praise. I'M TIRED OF THESE ACTS 2:38 SCREAMING, SHOUTING, &gt;&gt; Pentecostal babies. That's the only thing the word will produce." &gt;&gt; He's tired of them. Heat the fire up seven times hotter. Hallelujah. Don't take no chances. Hell turn the volume of the heat up as hot as it ever been. And when those three be children, it didn't move them. The very man that opened the furnace up, it killed him. It didn't move him. Oh, church. Do we have some believers? &gt;&gt; Oh, they was worshiping. &gt;&gt; There was worship of the true believer. &gt;&gt; I don't care how hot the trial gets. &gt;&gt; I'm going to praise my king. Oh, if we could come with THAT ATTITUDE. JOE REYNOLDS, IF you could come to church with that attitude, and I said this before, and I've heard many men of God say before, if everybody praised God like I did in a church, what kind of church service would we have? I say outs tonight, Lord, help me get rid of my self-centered ways. Brother R was said it and WHEN HE WAS OUT there in Hurricane Mountain, Lord, help me get away from this attitude, this self-centered way, and get William Brandham out of the way. But they just kept walking. &gt;&gt; Hell was turning up the fire, the volume of the heat. And they just kept walking. And they bound their hands. And they bound their feet. And they dropped them over into the fiery furnace heated up seven times hotter. And they shut the door. The fire didn't touch their hair. The fire didn't touch their clothes. The fire didn't touch their bodies. Brother man was saying like this. Just allowed the enough heat to do what? &gt;&gt; What did the prophet say, brother man? To loose them. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; He didn't want them not to praise God. Amen. And the fire, the heat, the only thing the heat did &gt;&gt; [snorts] &gt;&gt; It only burned off what didn't belong. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. THE VERY FIRE THAT THAT NEBUCHADNEZZAR CREATED TO DESTROY THOSE THREE BELIEVERS. ONLY THING IT DID, THEY BURIED THEM. BUT IT PLANTED a testimony. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. IT LOOED THEM. WHAT HELL done to compromise their worship couldn't survive the fire. &gt;&gt; THE LATCHES COULDN'T [screaming] SURVIVE THE FIRE, but Shadrach could. &gt;&gt; Oh, church. There was some loosening going on. There was some worship of a true believer. It wasn't as much as screaming and shouting and running. That's just the effects of a good revival. But a worship of a true believer is walking and proving God's word, making God, as I read in the first uh quote of the evening, amen, that you take God's word and he will prove it when you with &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. And that's what they did. I'm not &gt;&gt; Oh, what they meant for evil, God's turning it for other good. For the job, he is out to crack you, beat you, bury you. Church, we've all been through great trials and tribulation and famines and grief and sorrow. But because you're here standing is the evidence it didn't break you. &gt;&gt; Unbeliever can be broken, but a believer can never be broken. &gt;&gt; We came to this world shaped the way we are, but we wasn't broken. The real you. &gt;&gt; This ain't the real you. This is only the tabernacle that the real you is using now. A been it laid dormant for so long. BUT ONE DAY, AMEN, GOD came looking for me. I didn't go looking for him. He came looking for me. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Could you imagine what kind of revival that must have been? They was planning the testimony. Ain't nothing going to happen till my God's done with me. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Amen. And when they opened the the furnace door, there was some praising and there's some worship. Didn't we throw three men in the fire? Oh, devil, what you meant for evil? God has turned to good. Hell was preparing a funeral, but God was stirring a revival. The fire was supposed to end them rolly rollers lives. But through hell's burial. Are [snorts] you hearing me? &gt;&gt; You might think the trial you're going thing don't mean much, but listen to this. Through that burial, a king had to confess. A nation had to recognize and a decree had to be written. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Amen. What they did for evil, GOD SAID, "I GOT THIS. THIS IS A PREDESTINATED moment in time." Amen. Let's take that, LET IT SINK DEEP DOWN INTO YOUR RIBS this evening. Let you know the trouble that you're going through IS SEASONAL. AMEN. This too WILL PASS. IT CANNOT break you. Hallelujah. It may seem like it in a moment. Oh church, the fire furn became a platform of praise and worship. Tell your enemy tonight, tell him, "You didn't bury me, you planted me. What you meant to be a tomb to destroy me became a testimony. They plotted, they planned, they buried, but what you meant for evil, God meant for good. I should be dead. I should have been crazy. I should have been silenced. But God said, "What you plan to destroy me, God used to develop me." &gt;&gt; Oh, that's good. A testimony was born. &gt;&gt; I'm the thunder, the evidence. That's God's not dead. He's alive. &gt;&gt; Cuz evil said I was guilty. I'm gonna go ahead and close tonight. Evil says I was guilty. Evil said I was going to die. Evil said I'd never get over it. Evil said I'll carry my past. Evil said this, it plotted against me to try to break me. Evil said I'm guilty as charged, but God turned it &gt;&gt; and said, "You never done it in the first place. Satan has buried us in our past, but God turned it. What Satan did to bury you is now A TESTIMONY. GOD CAN turn a gambler around. GOD CAN turn an ADULT AROUND. GOD CAN TURN AN alcoholic around. GOD CAN HEAL THE SICK. GOD CAN RAISE THE DEAD. GOD can heal the deaf. God can heal the blinded eyes. &gt;&gt; What hell meant for evil, God is turning it for your good. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Oh death, where is your victory? Oh grave, where is your victory? Oh death, where is your sting? Hallelujah. Oh, we're having a popcorn meeting. Turning that yall. Brother Brown said, "Take that yall corn, put it in some heat." Oh, it can't help himself. &gt;&gt; They try to crack it. They try to do what they can. They put the heat on it. Oh, Sister Destiny can't you can't help yourself. &gt;&gt; All of a sudden, you begin to hear the right song, hear the right word preached in the right season. Oh, church. Amen. There wasn't enough There wasn't enough uh uh uh kings. There weren't enough Pharaohs. There wasn't enough Nebuchadnezzars. There wasn't enough Amen. Uh uh Philistines to stop Samson Shamgar. There wasn't ENOUGH GIANT TO STOP DAVID. &gt;&gt; I was looking at that this weekend. This is really off my topic tonight, but I was actually looking at where brother Brown said David slung uh through that stone and the Holy Spirit picked it up and sped it up a thousand miles. Not a minute, he said a second. You know how fast that is? That's fast. That's mock speed. That's like I forgot what it was. I had it all down. I I wasn't going to use it tonight, but it was like 0.057 or something of light speed. It could travel around the world like seven times. And that giant was only like let's say maybe 150 feet away from him. Could you imagine how fast that stone was traveling? It wasn't David. They was trying to bury David. They was only planting a testimony that David couldn't do it, but God can. &gt;&gt; I can't get over this. They said, "I would never be able to have it." They said, "I'll never get over it." Oh, they don't know the power of my God. Amen. In the face of opposition, when the odds are stacked against you, if you will let it go, God's going to pick it up and speed it up a thousand miles per second. I say I say, let's go ahead and praise him tonight for it. I say let the worshippers arise tonight and said, "I know I've been battling some problems. I've been battling health issues. I've been fing a trial, temptations." &gt;&gt; I say, "So did Job. &gt;&gt; But hold on. The king still has one more move. &gt;&gt; YOU'RE NOT FINISHED. YOU'RE NOT BROKEN. &gt;&gt; There's a predestinated bell down inside of you that can't be broken. And just when you're about to give up, Brother Bramble said, "If the musicians will come," Brother Bram said, just at that moment, Job was ready to about give up. Brother Mark, all of a sudden, he felt that that line that's been running loose. &gt;&gt; You know, I read that I about had a runaround. I did about have a runaround today two or three times because when I thought I shared it with brother Matt, I actually shared it with brother Amos this morning. I text him. I said, "You know what? Amen. What Satan has tried to compromise my worship with can't survive the fire." &gt;&gt; And I thought, "Praise the Lord." &gt;&gt; What he meant for evil, what what the enemy meant FOR EVIL, GOD IS TURNING IT FOR YOUR GOOD. THAT IS NOT A QUESTION MARK. That's exclamation point. God's going to MAKE THIS TRIAL A BLESSING. &gt;&gt; You might be in a prison. You might be in a dungeon. [music] You might be a Joseph. You might be a Jacob. But down inside of Jacob, brother Roy, the scripture said Jacob fainted and his his spirit fainted. When the brothers came to him said, "Joseph is alive." This is one of my favorite portions of scripture. He said, "Joseph's alive." And he said his spirit. Jacob says, "I can't. I'll never make it. I'm too old. My body is worn. I'm cracked. Brother Morgan. But when he began to see there was wagons from the king waiting on and begin to testify to him, Jacob, you're not going to have to make this journey alone. The king has brought wagons to carry you. He knew Jacob couldn't ma make it in his old age and well stricken. But also the scripture says when he seen the wagons the spirit of Jacob was revived and it said Israel said I can make it. awoken the worshipper within Jacob. Jacob said, "There's no way." How many's been there before? Amen. We get to the place I don't think we can get over this situation, can't there's not nothing's going to come good out of this situation. But a preacher came tonight to tell you, don't believe the devil's lie. If you are a believer, God's going to turn what meant for evil to benefit. and is planted a testimony. And a testimony has been born to testify a thunder, a thunder of a greater power, a greater source beyond my ability is here. Hallelujah. And I say the same scans, they have scanned brother's wife and said she has cancer. She's got a tumor. Amen. And brother Brown said she he kept keeping the size of it. By the time you know the spirit of the Lord told him said before the doctor's hands touch her, it'll be gone. Oh, the enemy came in like a flood. She still had it. He went to her and felt as Sister Tammy said it felt like a football bulging out of her. Oh, Satan tried to crack him. But let me tell you something. When she went down and the doctor be to take the knives to her, brothers and sister, God proved his word. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. I say he's the same God tonight. Doctors can say whatever they want to, but let me tell you, write this down. Put it on your refrigerator. What hell meant for evil, God is turning [music] it for your good. What Satan tried to bury you with, it was only a planning season for you to come back to Grace Tabernacle. Said, "Brother Matt, can I testify? Can I testify? You remember when you was preaching that Sunday morning and you was and you said, "Oh, I don't even know why I'm here. You was speaking to my heart. I was preaching at brother David Siler several months ago while I was on a cruise last week. A brother from his church calls me. [music] He says, "Brother Joe, you remember when you was here, Satan was battling me like nothing else." He said he was even in the service where he was preaching But the seed was planted not for my glory, for his, for God. And he's the same way tonight. You say, "You remember when you was preaching that, brother Matt? You was right on me." Oh, church, let me finish with this. Hell has been turned [music] up. Hell has been heated up in the hour that we're living in. church. Brother Brian Archill, my grandchildren time tries will have to face things brother Roy me and you have never faced. It's evil. Men's heart are felling for fear. It's just doom and gloom and the can of hell's been ripped open. Evil is everywhere. And brother Matt, when you get on that other side and you're walking [music] down the streets of gold and there's going to be soldiers coming said, "What age did you live in?" I come out of Leosia age. You did. THAT WAS LIKE THE DARKEST OF DARKEST. That was so much evil. How'd you do it? &gt;&gt; [snorts] &gt;&gt; What hell meant for evil, God turned it for good. What he tried to bury me. I didn't just survive it, I overcome it. Greater is he that is in me than the he that's in the world. Hey church, it's evil. a lot of it out there, but it can't break you. It can't break you. Are you hearing it? I just believe it with all my heart. There's going to be testimonies. There's going to be testimonies. [music] Hey, we could probably write a book already what God has done in Grace Tabernacle in seven years. They said it was nothing. It would crumble. It would never work. It'll never grow. never move. It would ne God would never orchestrate a work here in Black Rockck. But let me tell you what they tried to crumble, what they tried to break. There's a bell sounded LOUD SAYS GOD'S NOT DEAD. HE'S alive and [snorts] he's working in the midst of Grace Tabernacle. Say, "Brother Joe, is there problems?" Well, for us humans here, there's problems. But you can go to whatever church you want to think about. You can listen to your greatest preacher. You think that he that he's the the lead of elite. But let me tell you something. He's trapped in humanity just like you are. If you got humans, you're going to have problems. But the beauty of it is the beauty of it is we got some Abrahams. not going to stagger at the problems, but be strong in faith and begin to praise our God. Why can you praise God tonight when all hell is poured out? Because a worshipper, the worship of a true believer in closing isn't dictated by trials, famines, persecution, droughts, hard days, good days, rainy days. The worship of a true believer is taking God at his word and proving it right in the [music] face of opposition. &gt;&gt; The king has one more move. He's not done with you. Hallelujah. Can you stand to your feet tonight? Hallelujah. Let the worshippers [singing] arrive. Let your sons and your daughters sing. [music] Oh, just go ahead and surrender your all to him tonight to the king. Let your birds arise. [singing] Let your sons and [music] your daughters sing. Surrender [singing and music] in my own. I surrender to the king. One more time. Worshippers arise. [music] Letter shines in your daughter who see [music] it my all. [music] I surrender [singing] to the king. Go ahead and play it. Let's just bow our hearts for a moment of prayer tonight. If Satan has been battling you and trying to crack [music] your spirit and crack your home, crack your crack crack your spiritual walk, trying to bury you in situations, bury you in feelings. Ah, I said, let the worshippers arise tonight. God's going to make this trial a blessing. What hell meant for evil is turning for your good. Can we just pray tonight? Lord Jesus, we pray. Lord God, they begin to shake those chains tonight and begin to lift their hands to praise and worship. A testimony is being born. A revival has been stirred. what hell meant for a funeral possession. You was arranging a revival, a jail house revival, a barn, a boneyard revival. What hell was meant for evil, you was turning it for good. Lord, I pray, Lord God, that you bless them, Lord God, that they would take this this few moments of encouragement by your word tonight and take your word and allow you to prove it in their life and become a testimony that God's not dead. He's very much alive. Bless your saints tonight, Lord, in Jesus Christ's name. Hallelujah, brother Matt. Let the worshippers arise.

What a powerful message tonight in the greatest [music] trial of your life. There's really a testimony being born. But isn't that isn't that just what the devil didn't know what was happening? [music] Oh, Goliath down there. He told David, he said, "What am I, a dog that you had come at me with sticks?" Said, "But I'll feed your body to the fowls of the air and the beast of the field." But little did he know that David wasn't going to be buried in [music] the valley of Elum. But instead in the valley of Elum, there was a testimony born. [music] Amen. He became a great warrior in the middle of the greatest battle. I thought, isn't that the Isn't that the way our God does? Amen. In the greatest trial. What a wonderful message. Now, how many enjoyed that tonight? [music] Amen. And in the worst trial of your life [applause] and and what God or what Satan would bind you with, he would bind you and put you through the fire. And the very thing he bound you with couldn't even stand the fire &gt;&gt; that he put you through. That's the way God does, isn't it? Takes what's meant for evil and turns it to our good. [music] He never fails us. I don't think there's anything that goes on in our life that God don't allow. Amen. You believe that? Every trial. And he said he had never put on you more than you could bear. So that means we're going to make it through the other side. Do you love the Lord tonight? Somebody give me another hand clap of praise tonight. So many times I've questioned certain circumstances, things I could [singing and music] not understand. Many times in trials, [music and singing] weakness blurs my vision. My frustration gets so out [music and singing] of hand. It's when I am reminded [singing and music] I've never been forsaken. I've never had to [music] stand one test alone. [singing] As I look [music] at all the victories, the spirit rises up in me. Is through the fire. my weaknesses made strong. He never promised that the cross [singing and music] would not get heavy and the hill would not be hard to [music] he never [singing] offered victory [music] without fighting. He said, "Help will always come in time." You remember [music] when you're standing in the valley [singing] of decision and the adversary [music] says [singing] he just hold on [music] our Lord will show up and he will take you through the fire again. [singing and music] Many times I've questioned many circumstances, things in my life [singing] I just don't understand. There's been many trials, so many weaknesses. [music] &gt;&gt; Then [singing] life's frustration gets so out of hand. Oh, it's only then that he's never forsaken me. [music and singing] I've never had to stand on test alone.

If you've been through the fire tonight, I want you to give the Lord a hand clap of praise. You can say, "That's my testimony." when I felt like giving in and I felt like throwing up my hands, but something burnt the chains that had me bound and out of my lips instead of saying I quit or I give up or I'm not going back, but instead out of my lips when I wanted to to quit on God, something out of my lips said, "But I give you glory anyhow.
