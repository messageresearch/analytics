[43:45] abundantly above all that we could ask

[46:42] pray and all the Believers says amen and
[46:46] amen The Book of John the 16th chapter
[46:49] and in the 33rd verse Jesus here is
[46:51] speaking he says these things I have
[46:54] spoken unto you
[46:56] that in me you might have peace now in
[46:59] the world ye shall have tribulation so
[47:03] here he's separating those that are in
[47:05] him and those that are in the world and
[47:07] he's saying in the world you shall have
[47:10] tribulation but be of good cheer for I
[47:13] have overcome the world Amen could we
[47:17] read that verse together I have overcome
[47:21] the world that's more than just words to
[47:23] me that's a promise amen if you're in
[47:26] him he has overcome the world now in the
[47:30] Book of Revelation the thirr
[47:31] chapter Revelation the 3r chapter and in
[47:34] the 21st verse Revelation 3 and verse
[47:38] number 21 uh the Bible here again Jesus
[47:41] speaking to the lay odyssean Church age
[47:44] in Revelation 3 and verse
[47:46] 21 uh the Bible here Jesus is speaking
[47:51] and he's given us some very powerful
[47:53] promises and I love this because here he
[47:56] says to him that overcometh will I grant
[47:59] to sit with me in my throne even as I
[48:02] also
[48:04] overcame and am sat down with my father
[48:08] in his throne now brother BR said that's
[48:10] not to the group that's to the
[48:11] individual so we could very well very
[48:14] well say to the individual that
[48:16] overcometh will I grant to sit with me
[48:18] in my throne even as I also overcame and
[48:21] am sat down with my father in his throne
[48:24] and he says he that hath an ear let him
[48:26] hear what the spirit saith unto the
[48:29] church now brother REM said he that has
[48:31] an ear he said that's the individual not
[48:33] the whole group the individual that's
[48:35] the bride coming out the church amen we
[48:39] ask the Lord this evening to add the
[48:40] blessing to the reading of his word as
[48:42] you can have your seats here uh this
[48:44] evening I want you by the help of the
[48:45] Lord for just a few moments if I could
[48:47] to speak to you tonight and I just pray
[48:49] that we can say something to be a
[48:51] blessing and a help to you but if I will
[48:53] title this tonight I want to speak to
[48:54] you on the elected Overcomers of this
[48:58] age amen the elected Overcomers of this
[49:01] age and I maybe just draw this from a
[49:03] thought out of the message Faith 1956
[49:06] brother R said here I am standing here
[49:08] just yielding myself and the Holy Spirit
[49:11] to moving and this is what you call
[49:13] Heavenly places in Christ Jesus but
[49:15] remember Satan's always skeptic at the
[49:18] sons of God Amen remember Satan is
[49:21] always skeptical of the sons of God you
[49:24] know he always does that someone with a
[49:26] skeptic idea he said and when they do
[49:29] that he's just trying to interfere amen
[49:32] but Christians always overcome amen amen
[49:36] the devil is trying to interfere but
[49:38] Christians always overcome amen let me
[49:41] ask you how many Christians do we have
[49:43] here tonight amen then if you are a
[49:45] Christian there is not a possibility you
[49:47] will overcome amen but Christians always
[49:50] overcome again he says and how can I
[49:52] overcome now remember amen that Christ
[49:55] spoke of an elected people amen for this
[49:58] last day now we know there's seven
[50:00] Gentile Church ages right amen all the
[50:03] way from Ephesus un Leota and we're not
[50:06] in Ephesus we're not in thara we're not
[50:08] in we're not even in the Philadelphian
[50:10] age amen but according to the word we
[50:12] have come to the last Church age which
[50:13] is the leoan age amen which is the end
[50:17] time or is the time of the fullness of
[50:19] all things amen and it is a time where
[50:21] there was elected in Ephesus there was
[50:24] elected in samna there was elected in
[50:26] every age so in this last day amen
[50:29] there's got to be an elected people that
[50:31] will overcome now I don't know maybe how
[50:33] you feel about yourself but I believe
[50:35] that I'm speaking to Caleb's amen the
[50:37] Bible said in numbers 13:30 amen that
[50:40] Caleb stealed the people before Moses
[50:42] and said these words he said let us go
[50:45] up at once amen and possess it for we
[50:48] are well able to overcome it amen I love
[50:51] the words of Caleb we are well able to
[50:53] overcome it there was no hesitation in
[50:56] Caleb's confession there was no question
[50:58] mark in Caleb's confession amen when
[51:01] Caleb stealed the people he gave him a
[51:03] direct order and said now listen we are
[51:05] well able to overcome it that word
[51:07] overcome means to Prevail it means to
[51:10] overcome amen I love this it means to
[51:12] endure it means to have power it means
[51:15] to be able to gain or to accomplish
[51:17] something it is to be able to endure it
[51:19] is to be able to reach to Prevail over
[51:22] against something it is to overcome to
[51:24] be the victory Amen to have the ability
[51:27] and the strength to overcome amen there
[51:29] was a mouthful said in those words amen
[51:32] we are well able to endure it we are
[51:34] well able to overcome it we are well
[51:37] able to take the land we are well able
[51:39] amen we have the strength we have the
[51:41] ability amen now tonight I want to tell
[51:44] you Grace Tabernacle amen Caleb is not
[51:46] here but the spirit of Caleb is in this
[51:49] building amen and there is an
[51:50] announcement from the word that we are
[51:53] well able to overcome Le oosa amen I
[51:56] know that you wish you could get saved
[51:57] and tomorrow go in the Rapture amen but
[52:00] you would not be an overcomer amen if
[52:02] God saved you the very day and raptured
[52:04] you the same day amen but if he saved
[52:06] you you got to go through some things
[52:08] amen but here's the Glorious thing about
[52:10] it he did not save you amen hoping you
[52:13] would be able to overcome and to come
[52:15] into the inheritance but he saved you
[52:18] amen knowing that you were well able to
[52:20] overcome Le amen I am persuaded of
[52:23] better things about you tonight Church
[52:25] amen you are well able to overcome the
[52:27] devil you are well able to overcome sin
[52:30] you are well able to overcome situation
[52:33] amen because the word said we are well
[52:36] able how many agrees with me we are well
[52:39] aable amen amen not we're going to be
[52:41] but we are amen not we might be but we
[52:43] are we are well able to overcome now in
[52:47] 1 John 2:13 the Bible says I write unto
[52:49] you fathers amen because you have known
[52:52] him that is from the beginning somebody
[52:53] say the beginning amen you have known
[52:56] him from the beginning now I write unto
[52:58] you young men amen because ye have
[53:01] overcome the wicked one I write unto you
[53:04] little children amen because you have
[53:06] known the father verse 14 amen I have
[53:09] written unto you fathers because you
[53:11] have known him that is from the
[53:13] beginning now watch what John is doing
[53:15] amen he's bringing the God that was in
[53:17] the beginning amen all the way to the
[53:20] present amen but he's addressing a group
[53:22] of people that would be in the last days
[53:24] amen when the Antichrist Spirit would
[53:26] come into full effect amen but at the
[53:29] same time the Antichrist Spirit would be
[53:31] coming into full effect there would be a
[53:33] bride who would be moving into the
[53:35] revelation of the sons of God and she
[53:37] would be well able to overcome the
[53:39] Antichrist she would be well able to
[53:41] overcome the devil listen I don't know
[53:43] about you tonight but I think we need to
[53:45] shake it off and remember amen that we
[53:47] are well able to overcome amen we are
[53:50] well able to overcome deception we are
[53:52] well able to overcome situations amen we
[53:55] are well able to overcome bad days and
[53:57] bad feelings amen we're well able to
[53:59] overcome bad attitudes we're well able
[54:02] to overcome sin amen because God has
[54:05] sent us a message and it's not a
[54:07] temporary message it's an eternal
[54:09] message and it has come from the God
[54:11] that was in the beginning and the God
[54:13] that was in the alpha has now become
[54:15] Omega and the same power that was in the
[54:17] beginning is now here in the end I write
[54:20] unto you amen cuz you have known him
[54:22] that is from the beginning I have
[54:24] written to you young men because you are
[54:27] strong amen and the word of God abideth
[54:30] in you amen young men let me say this
[54:32] you're not weaklings Amen to the world
[54:34] you may be weaklings amen but under this
[54:37] message you are strong amen because the
[54:39] word of God is abiding in you and ye
[54:42] have overcome the wicked one do you
[54:45] realize before you was ever born this
[54:47] was written about you amen before you
[54:49] ever come on the earth Carter amen the
[54:51] word said you overcome the wicked one
[54:54] and here you are years later manifesting
[54:57] what the word prophesied you would do
[54:59] Church of the Living God we're not here
[55:01] playing church we are a prophetic class
[55:03] of people that have stepped from the
[55:05] pages of the book and we are here
[55:07] manifesting God Amen not as they
[55:10] overcome but as the Overcomers amen you
[55:13] are strong because the word of God
[55:15] abideth in you and ye have overcome the
[55:18] wicked one I love that because the same
[55:21] words that Jesus used amen it's the same
[55:23] words John used and Jesus said I have
[55:26] overcome the world and here John is
[55:28] saying you have overcome the world Amen
[55:31] now how could he say that amen because
[55:33] the God that was in Jesus is the same
[55:36] God that's in the bride and if God
[55:38] overcome in Jesus he's going to overcome
[55:40] in you amen there's not one Holy Ghost
[55:43] for the prophet and one Hol I feel like
[55:45] preaching tonight and not one Holy Ghost
[55:47] for the young people amen but the same
[55:49] Holy Ghost amen that Jesus received on
[55:52] the River Jordan is the same Holy Ghost
[55:55] every SE gen of God has received and
[55:58] what the Holy Ghost did in Jesus the
[56:00] Holy Ghost will do in you if the Holy
[56:03] Ghost overcome in him the Holy Ghost has
[56:05] to overcome in you if it's the same Holy
[56:10] Ghost ye have overcome the wicked one
[56:13] brother Bram says faith is our Victory
[56:15] he says now Faith is a conqueror how
[56:17] many can testify that faith is a
[56:19] conqueror amen he said faith is an
[56:22] overcomer it isn't just a peacemaker it
[56:24] over comes amen now can I say this
[56:27] there's a time to make peace and there's
[56:29] a time to declare war there's a time to
[56:31] make peace with the devil but then
[56:33] there's other times that you got to say
[56:34] devil you've gone as far as you're going
[56:36] to go I have been anointed I have been
[56:39] elected I have been chosen Amen to
[56:41] overcome you amen the word speaks of
[56:44] better things than me I'm I want to say
[56:46] to you tonight if you're under the devil
[56:48] amen the word speaks of better things of
[56:50] you if you're under his negativity and
[56:52] his depression and his doom and his
[56:54] Gloom the word I'm preaching amen speaks
[56:57] better things of you it speaks of joy
[56:59] unspeakable it speaks of peace and power
[57:03] and authority listen we ain't got to
[57:05] back up to the devil we are strong
[57:07] because the word of God is abiding in
[57:10] the Church of God which is causing you
[57:12] to overcome faith is a conqueror faith
[57:15] is an overcomer faith is the victory
[57:18] that overcomes the world what does it do
[57:20] he said what is Faith what is the
[57:22] conquer amen conquer and victory is the
[57:25] same y'all ready for this definition he
[57:27] said to conquer it means to beat down it
[57:30] means to override it means to handcuff
[57:33] and to throw in prison you know what
[57:35] some of y'all need to do tonight you
[57:37] need to beat that devil down you need to
[57:39] override that devil you need to handcuff
[57:42] that devil and you need to put that
[57:44] devil in prison amen the word doesn't
[57:46] speak of you being in prison but it does
[57:48] speak of the devil being in prison the
[57:51] word doesn't speak of you being bound
[57:53] but it does speak of the devil being
[57:55] bound and I think it's high time for the
[57:57] Church of the Living God Amen to rise up
[57:59] out of the conditions of life and beat
[58:02] that devil down and Pie that devil down
[58:04] and put that devil in prison it means
[58:07] the sin that once ruled you amen you now
[58:11] rule it well glory to God the sin that
[58:15] once ruled you he said you rule it now
[58:18] it means you've overcome it you have
[58:20] whipped it are you ready for this you're
[58:23] greater than it is
[58:25] well that's a shouting point right there
[58:27] you're greater than it is the unbelief
[58:30] that once ruled you amen through the
[58:33] Holy Ghost amen through the word that
[58:35] abides in you you have beat it down you
[58:38] have whipped it you have handcuffed it
[58:41] you have put it in prison and David Paul
[58:43] you are greater than it you are greater
[58:45] than the sin you are greater than the
[58:47] unbelief come on I'm saying you church I
[58:50] don't look at you by the way you look at
[58:51] yourself I look at you by the word and I
[58:54] say you're greater than what you've been
[58:55] through you're greater than what you're
[58:57] facing you're greater than what the
[58:59] devil's telling you you're greater than
[59:01] what the devil's trying to convince you
[59:03] you are an overcomer and if you ever
[59:05] come alive to the Revelation that in you
[59:08] is somebody greater and stronger and
[59:11] mightier than the devil you will
[59:12] overcome every devil because you're
[59:15] greater than it is I love what brother
[59:17] man preaches he says how can I overcome
[59:21] he said I chose this because I think
[59:23] it's a time that we should never let the
[59:25] spirit of Revival die we've got to keep
[59:28] in Revival constantly revived every day
[59:31] because Paul said he had to Die daily
[59:34] that Christ could live and we must never
[59:37] let that Revival amen die within
[59:41] us we must never let that Revival die
[59:45] within us again he says overcome what
[59:47] does it mean it means to keep life in
[59:50] you because when life goes out amen then
[59:53] that's what brought that law L into that
[59:55] condition but you don't know the log
[59:57] he's talking about he said I stepped on
[59:59] that log and he said when I stepped on
[1:00:01] it it give way he said what happened to
[1:00:03] it he said at one time you could step on
[1:00:05] it and then you could walk on it he said
[1:00:08] but it fell down and life left it and
[1:00:10] when life left it it came into an old
[1:00:12] Doty condition he said so now it can't
[1:00:15] handle nothing amen and the first time
[1:00:17] you step on it or you don't shake its
[1:00:19] hand or you don't visit it or you don't
[1:00:21] pat it on the back amen it falls apart
[1:00:24] and goes home amen but we're not a bunch
[1:00:26] of Doty logs amen we're Overcomers and
[1:00:29] we have learned how to keep life in US
[1:00:31] amen is it easy brother Joe no amen it's
[1:00:34] hard amen sometimes we got to sacrifice
[1:00:37] sometimes we got to die out to ourselves
[1:00:39] amen sometimes we got to take our flesh
[1:00:42] and we got to crucify our flesh amen but
[1:00:44] I say there's a blessing Amen in
[1:00:46] crucifying your flesh Paul said that I
[1:00:49] might die that Christ might live in me I
[1:00:52] say tonight Church Jesus Crucify My My
[1:00:54] Flesh that you might live through
[1:00:57] me because I am an overcomer now in
[1:01:01] Revelation three we read about the
[1:01:03] Overcomer but what I love about it is we
[1:01:05] don't stop at the Overcomer but Jesus
[1:01:07] speaks of the throne and he said said
[1:01:09] did you notice the arrangements of that
[1:01:11] see amen sat with me in my Throne amen
[1:01:14] not on my throne but in my Throne amen
[1:01:17] see that is in his domain he said and
[1:01:20] now as Christ is the ruler he is the
[1:01:23] throne ruler at this time amen of the
[1:01:26] complete domain of God Amen so will the
[1:01:30] church be with him amen the bride be
[1:01:33] with him in his throne in the entire
[1:01:35] domain see not on my throne but in my
[1:01:39] Throne somebody say that with me Amen in
[1:01:41] my Throne amen not on the throne but in
[1:01:44] my Throne see amen where his domain
[1:01:47] reaches he said now what is a throne
[1:01:50] amen a throne is over a domain and a
[1:01:53] domain reaches as far amen as its
[1:01:56] boundaries does amen and this is from
[1:01:59] eternity to Eternity amen so we're not
[1:02:02] talking amen about a temporary Kingdom
[1:02:05] with a temporary king with a temporary
[1:02:08] dominion and temporary subjects but we
[1:02:10] are speaking about an eternal God and
[1:02:13] that's why John said amen you have known
[1:02:16] him from the beginning because the one
[1:02:18] that was at the beginning has come to
[1:02:20] the ending and you are just as much a
[1:02:23] part of him in the end
[1:02:25] as you was in the beginning amen you got
[1:02:27] SE life on the inside of you and there
[1:02:30] is a representation in your soul that is
[1:02:33] greater than anything you've been
[1:02:35] through anything you're going through or
[1:02:37] anything we will go through we are a
[1:02:40] part of a
[1:02:42] domain now as Believers Church we have a
[1:02:45] Dominion as Believers we have a Dominion
[1:02:49] Romans 6:14 says amen that sin amen
[1:02:52] shall not have dominion over you you for
[1:02:55] ye are not under the law but you are
[1:02:57] under grace amen sin shall not have
[1:03:01] dominion over you amen but ye are not
[1:03:04] under law you are under grace brother
[1:03:07] said our Dominion is the dominion over
[1:03:09] sin and it is enforced through the power
[1:03:12] that is in the spirit of Christ that
[1:03:15] indwells us see every Kingdom on Earth
[1:03:18] is going to be tored down amen but ours
[1:03:21] will remain now this scripture here is
[1:03:23] speaking
[1:03:24] amen of us being Kings over a Dominion
[1:03:28] amen and not under law but under grace
[1:03:31] amen can I say this to you amen you are
[1:03:33] Kings in the present as well as in the
[1:03:36] future according to Revelation 1:5 amen
[1:03:39] the Bible said from Jesus Christ who is
[1:03:41] the faithful witness the first begotten
[1:03:43] of the Dead the prince of the kings of
[1:03:45] the earth unto him that loved us amen
[1:03:48] and washed us from our sins in his own
[1:03:50] blood look at verse six and hath made us
[1:03:53] amen Kings and Priests unto God and his
[1:03:57] father to him be glory and Dominion
[1:03:59] forever and ever amen I want you to
[1:04:02] catch these words the Bible says he hath
[1:04:05] made us I love what brother said he said
[1:04:08] there are certain truths that we need to
[1:04:10] emphasize and this is one of them that
[1:04:13] he hath made us amen that's a that's a
[1:04:16] that's an emphasizing Point amen that we
[1:04:19] didn't make ourselves amen but he hath
[1:04:22] made us amen salv is his doing salvation
[1:04:26] is of the Lord amen it is all of Grace
[1:04:30] he redeemed us for a purpose he bought
[1:04:32] us for a purpose and we are Kings and
[1:04:35] spiritual Kings amen now can I break
[1:04:37] something down to you can I break the
[1:04:39] present down to you and the future said
[1:04:42] oh we are going to be Kings upon the
[1:04:44] Earth with him when he sits on the
[1:04:46] throne so what the devil does is the
[1:04:49] devil says well in the future you're
[1:04:50] going to be kings in the future you're
[1:04:52] going to Reign amen so don't worry about
[1:04:54] it right now but brother said but now we
[1:04:57] are spiritual Kings and we are reigning
[1:05:00] over a spiritual Kingdom according to
[1:05:02] Romans 5:17 if by one man's offense
[1:05:05] death reigned by one then much more they
[1:05:07] which received abundance of Grace and of
[1:05:09] the gift of righteousness shall reign in
[1:05:12] life amen by one Jesus Christ amen then
[1:05:16] this word I'm speaking about amen abides
[1:05:18] in you and it came into you and it broke
[1:05:21] the curse of the law off of you and
[1:05:24] transferred you or translated you amen
[1:05:26] from the kingdom of darkness into the
[1:05:28] reign of his glorious son listen you're
[1:05:31] not going to be victorious when the
[1:05:33] Rapture takes place you're not going to
[1:05:35] be victorious when you make it to heaven
[1:05:37] but right here tonight amen by the word
[1:05:40] of the Lord You Are Spiritual Kings and
[1:05:43] spiritual priests and you are victorious

[1:06:14] is right here right now you have
[1:06:16] dominion over sin you have dominion over
[1:06:19] the world you have dominion over the
[1:06:21] Flesh and the devil and what are you

[1:06:26] and glory you are showing forth himself
[1:06:29] for it is Christ in us somebody say
[1:06:32] Christ in US amen that is willing and
[1:06:35] doing of his good pleasure yes indeed
[1:06:37] even now we are seated in Heavenly
[1:06:40] places in Christ Jesus amen then can I
[1:06:43] identify you by the word you are the
[1:06:46] Overcomer amen somebody help me preach
[1:06:48] tonight and say I am the Overcomer I am
[1:06:52] amen some of y'all still sitting there
[1:06:53] with your m M Clos I am the Overcomer
[1:06:56] you know why you're not saying that
[1:06:58] because you don't feel like it amen you
[1:07:00] don't think like it you don't see how it
[1:07:02] could be amen but sometime or another
[1:07:04] church you got to divorce your thoughts
[1:07:07] you got to forsake your ideas you got to
[1:07:09] forsake your ideas amen and embrace what
[1:07:12] the word says and the word says you are
[1:07:14] the Overcomer amen and the Overcomer has
[1:07:17] a dominion over the devil over sin over
[1:07:20] the world over the flesh amen right here
[1:07:23] tonight the devil is defeated amen and
[1:07:26] Jesus Christ is victorious in the reign
[1:07:29] of the Bride of Jesus Christ I'm not
[1:07:31] talking to church members I'm talking to
[1:07:34] Overcomers I'm not talking to citizens
[1:07:36] of Arkansas I'm talking to Overcomers
[1:07:39] and the prophet said the Overcomer amen
[1:07:42] is the heir of all things amen you know
[1:07:44] people I don't see what's the matter
[1:07:46] with you as Christians he said that you
[1:07:48] don't walk around a little while and see
[1:07:51] what you own now come on if you found
[1:07:53] out if you found out that somebody died
[1:07:56] and left you air to everything that was
[1:07:58] in Bass Pro or everything that was Amen
[1:08:00] in some shopping mall down in Jonesburg
[1:08:03] or somewhere amen you wouldn't go in
[1:08:04] there and stand at the door and say Well
[1:08:06] it must be nice amen but you're going to
[1:08:08] walk around and you're going to see what
[1:08:10] you air to well listen Jesus Christ died
[1:08:14] amen that every promise in this book
[1:08:16] might be fulfilled in us then I think
[1:08:18] it's high time to put our walking shoes
[1:08:21] on and start walking around in the
[1:08:23] promise land I think it's time to start
[1:08:25] walking around we are not the inheritors
[1:08:28] of depression we are not the inheritors
[1:08:30] of condemnation we are not the
[1:08:32] inheritors of sickness but we are the
[1:08:34] sons of God and we are the inheritors of
[1:08:37] joy unspeakable we are the inheritors of
[1:08:40] peace that passes all understanding we
[1:08:43] are the inheritors of revelation we are
[1:08:45] the inheritors of anointing we have not
[1:08:48] been put in Leota to be subjected to the
[1:08:51] king of Leota we have been put in leot
[1:08:53] see it to subject amen the God of this
[1:08:56] evil age Amen to the word of God and
[1:08:59] walk over that devil on Monday walk over
[1:09:01] that devil on Tuesday walk over that
[1:09:04] devil on Friday walk over that devil
[1:09:06] come on put your walking shoes on and
[1:09:08] start walking over that devil as
[1:09:12] Overcomers you're not defeated you're
[1:09:17] Overcomers and you're air to more than
[1:09:19] what you're letting the devil tell you
[1:09:20] you're heir
[1:09:22] to now the prophet said this is the age
[1:09:25] of the Overcomer he said now look Canaan
[1:09:28] does not represent the age of the
[1:09:29] Millennium it only represents the age of
[1:09:32] the Overcomer the
[1:09:34] dispensation of
[1:09:36] overcoming because in Canaan they killed
[1:09:39] and they burned and took cities but
[1:09:42] there'll be no death in the Millennium
[1:09:45] so right now amen so many promises have
[1:09:48] been laid in the future and people says
[1:09:51] in the
[1:09:52] millennium youall heard that hadn't you
[1:09:55] in the Millennium in the future someday
[1:09:59] some hour some time but here's what I
[1:10:02] say we won't need Divine Healing in the
[1:10:05] Millennium we won't need breakthroughs
[1:10:07] in the Millennium come on church we
[1:10:10] won't need we won't need miracles in the
[1:10:12] Millennium we won't need to get together
[1:10:15] and overcome our flesh to have a good
[1:10:16] service in the I'm preaching to you amen
[1:10:19] right now is when we need you to be an
[1:10:21] overcomer right now is when we need you
[1:10:23] to come in on Wednesday night and the
[1:10:25] world's sitting on your shoulders and
[1:10:27] everything's on your mind but you
[1:10:28] realize you're not subject to it you are
[1:10:30] an overcomer and you begin to pull on
[1:10:33] the word you begin to pull on the Holy
[1:10:35] Ghost and you begin to leave the Earthly
[1:10:37] places and move into Heavenly Places
[1:10:40] come on now's the time that we need a
[1:10:42] display of overcoming in The Bride of
[1:10:45] Jesus Christ right now is the time we
[1:10:47] need healing right now is the time we
[1:10:49] need to cast out Devils come on church
[1:10:51] now is the age of the over Overcomer
[1:10:54] it's not in the future it's right now
[1:10:57] you say brother Ander I'm waiting on the
[1:10:59] Millennium to fight amen we're not
[1:11:00] waiting on the millenum to fight amen
[1:11:03] now is the time to fight come on church
[1:11:05] now is the time to fight brother Wesley
[1:11:08] right now is the time to fight right now
[1:11:11] is the time Amen to draw your sword and
[1:11:14] fight back against that
[1:11:16] devil the prophet said Now's the Time
[1:11:19] where we have to fight to win the battle
[1:11:21] and to overcome the things to the world
[1:11:24] see there won't be any fighting there
[1:11:27] there won't be any fighting in the
[1:11:29] Millennium well brother and I'm waiting
[1:11:30] until I get in the Millennium and then
[1:11:31] I'm going to fight you will never be a
[1:11:33] fighter because there'll be no fighting
[1:11:36] in the Millennium the last prayer will
[1:11:39] be made there won't be no prayer
[1:11:40] meetings there'll be no more place for
[1:11:42] the people to get saved there'll be no
[1:11:44] sickness to be healed it'll just be one
[1:11:46] great glorious thing see what could we
[1:11:48] as human beings this morning what could
[1:11:50] we promise what could we look at
[1:11:52] anything that would be any greater than
[1:11:55] looking to that promise of that time so
[1:11:57] here's a prophet saying that the promise
[1:12:00] of that time is the door to that time oh
[1:12:03] God the promise of that time is the door
[1:12:06] to that time in other words this message
[1:12:09] is the door to the Millennium come on
[1:12:12] everything that's in this message is the
[1:12:14] door to the Future home is the door
[1:12:17] sister toys to the body change is the
[1:12:19] door to the Rapture is the door to the
[1:12:21] resurrection but if the devil can you
[1:12:23] not to fight now then you're never going
[1:12:25] to get
[1:12:28] there but I say this is a special time
[1:12:31] this is adoption time this is a time
[1:12:34] where we don't lay down to the devil we
[1:12:36] stand up to him this is a time where we
[1:12:38] don't take a back seat and say well
[1:12:40] maybe next Sunday I'll try again or next
[1:12:42] week I'll try again amen but this is the
[1:12:45] time that we stand Toe to Toe with that
[1:12:47] devil as manifested sons of God and we
[1:12:50] manifest our adoption now you say
[1:12:52] brother Andrew what is his spiritual
[1:12:54] adoption well the prophet of God said in
[1:12:56] Romans 8:14 he picks it up and says as
[1:12:59] many as are led by the spirit of God
[1:13:01] they are the sons of God now watch verse
[1:13:04] 15 for ye have not received the spirit
[1:13:06] of bondage again to fear but ye have
[1:13:09] received the spirit of adoption amen
[1:13:12] whereby we cry Abby father so we have
[1:13:16] not receive the spirit amen a bondage
[1:13:19] again to fear because we are Overcomers
[1:13:23] and we overcome the fear we have
[1:13:25] overcome the bondage and we have made
[1:13:27] our way to the inheritance of the spirit
[1:13:30] of adoption and it's changed our
[1:13:32] vocabulary and we now cry AB by father
[1:13:35] now brother said I'm only saying this
[1:13:37] not to mix up Doctrine but to straighten
[1:13:39] it out see that we might get away from
[1:13:41] this fear and scare you don't know who
[1:13:43] you are amen you don't know who you are
[1:13:46] he said you're not going to be amen but
[1:13:49] now you are the sons of
[1:13:52] God an't that beautiful you're not going
[1:13:55] to be but now you are the sons of God

[1:14:02] always were the sons of
[1:14:05] God you always were the sons of God in
[1:14:09] other words you are the sons of God by
[1:14:11] the seed of God and brother man picks
[1:14:14] this up in Cross the mystery he said
[1:14:15] you're already his by predestination so
[1:14:19] tonight Church we're not fighting
[1:14:21] whether we're his or not brother Harvey
[1:14:23] a prophet has come among the church and
[1:14:25] has settled the dispute of who we belong
[1:14:28] to we're not here tonight trying to get
[1:14:31] identified brother Jared we're not here
[1:14:33] ton not trying Amen to get somebody to
[1:14:35] claim us as their child but a Prophet

[1:14:42] God if you ever was a daughter of God
[1:14:45] you always was a daughter of God listen

[1:14:58] change that amen feelings don't change
[1:15:00] that Emotions Don't Change that it is

[1:15:21] world can get in see and cry in his
[1:15:23] alone it's already finished amen the
[1:15:26] seed was there amen can we move on to
[1:15:29] another battle can we move on from the
[1:15:31] Battle of one day I'm a son and the next
[1:15:33] day I'm not can we move on to a battle
[1:15:35] from one day I'm Scot seed and the next

[1:19:36] trained on how to have battles and come
[1:19:38] out on the other side Victorious you're

[1:19:56] some hard days but you know what you
[1:19:58] ought to do you ought to get on the page
[1:20:00] with Paul when he said the sufferings of
[1:20:02] this present time are not worthy to be
[1:20:06] compared with the glory which shall be
[1:20:10] revealed in us now come on what's going
[1:20:13] to reveal That Glory Victory under
[1:20:16] Victory under Victory you're going to
[1:20:19] have a hard time young people you're
[1:20:21] going to have a hard time but just
[1:20:23] rejoice in this you'll be ready at that
[1:20:26] time for the translation thank you
[1:20:28] Brothers amen now I'll say this with
[1:20:31] that Revelation in our hearts then now
[1:20:33] we are walking with the Revelation that
[1:20:35] we are the children of God by promise
[1:20:38] and
[1:20:40] Grace how many can say Amen we are the
[1:20:43] children by promise and by Grace Paul
[1:20:47] said if children and HS and Heirs of God
[1:20:50] and join HS with Christ amen there's a
[1:20:52] good anointing in here and the devil
[1:20:53] don't like it if so be that we suffer
[1:20:56] with him that we may be also glorified
[1:20:58] together now watch what Paul says for I
[1:21:01] reckon that the sufferings of this
[1:21:03] present time are not worthy to be
[1:21:06] compared with the glory which shall be
[1:21:08] revealed in US brother said the church
[1:21:10] is growing see each age it's allotted in
[1:21:12] the scripture here so God through the
[1:21:15] Holy Spirit Reveals His word by
[1:21:19] manifesting it and vindicating it
[1:21:21] himself and amen showing that it's his
[1:21:24] word being brought to pass in the day
[1:21:26] that it's promised now can I say this
[1:21:29] that we are living in the season we're
[1:21:31] church we are moving from just having
[1:21:33] expectations that we're actually walking
[1:21:36] in the manifestation of our
[1:21:38] expectation is that okay we're living in
[1:21:41] a season where we're not just gathered
[1:21:43] on Wednesdays and gathered on Sundays
[1:21:46] and compiling a bunch of expectations
[1:21:48] but we're living in the season amen
[1:21:50] where those expectations are
[1:21:53] manifestations can I prove it to you
[1:21:55] Grace Tabernacle just a few years ago
[1:21:57] you had a prayer board out there and you
[1:21:59] had some names on it that were
[1:22:01] expectations of prodical coming home but
[1:22:04] tonight their names are not out there as
[1:22:06] expectation but they're sitting here in
[1:22:09] the building as manifestation now come
[1:22:11] on Amen who brought that to pass Matt
[1:22:14] didn't do it I didn't do it a been no
[1:22:17] other preacher done it but somebody was
[1:22:19] following the pillar of fire and they
[1:22:21] realized they was going to have a rough
[1:22:23] way there was going to be some days the
[1:22:24] devil said they'll never come in there
[1:22:26] was going to be some days the devil said
[1:22:27] they'll never be saved amen but here
[1:22:29] they are tonight amen to show that they
[1:22:32] stood in line behind the headship of the
[1:22:35] pillar of fire and God had the ability
[1:22:37] to transform the expectations into
[1:22:40] manifestation now can I say this Paul
[1:22:43] said that the earnest expectation of the
[1:22:46] creature is waiting for what the
[1:22:49] manifestation of the sons of God look at
[1:22:51] this word manifest station it means to
[1:22:54] be revealed so the creature is waiting
[1:22:57] for the Revelation to be revealed to the
[1:23:00] sons of God now you all got a series
[1:23:02] called adoption right preached it in
[1:23:04] 1960 can I give you a few quotes from
[1:23:07] that paragraph 47 part two he said now
[1:23:10] and in the Bible we're living in the
[1:23:12] last days we're at the top of the
[1:23:14] pyramid sea the cross Fishers of the
[1:23:16] cancer age in the Zodiac in the time of
[1:23:19] the coming of the Leo the line in the
[1:23:20] capping Stone amen and in the days of
[1:23:23] the manifestation of the sons of God in
[1:23:25] the Bible seat paragraph uh 215 part
[1:23:28] three but this is the day this is the
[1:23:31] day this is the day of the manifestation
[1:23:35] of the sons of God when the Mysteries
[1:23:37] that's been hid since before the
[1:23:40] foundation of the world is to be made
[1:23:42] known this is the hour paragraph 76 part
[1:23:46] 4 now this may choke you to death but
[1:23:48] did you know that men that are sons of
[1:23:50] God brother Mark were amateur your Gods
[1:23:53] how many ever know that how many knew
[1:23:55] that that Jesus said amen did not your
[1:23:58] law say itself you're gods and if you
[1:24:00] call them Gods now watch which God said
[1:24:03] in Genesis 2 that they were Gods because
[1:24:06] they had full domain over the Dominion
[1:24:09] of the world see he give him dominion
[1:24:12] over all things but he lost his godship
[1:24:15] he lost his sunship he lost his domain
[1:24:19] and Satan took it over can I say why
[1:24:21] every one of us was born in sin shaping
[1:24:24] iniquity and come in the world speaking
[1:24:26] lies amen it was not just because of who
[1:24:29] our mom and daddy was it was because all
[1:24:31] the way back in the Garden of Eden amen
[1:24:34] Adam gave up his godship he gave up his
[1:24:36] sunship he gave up his dominion and
[1:24:39] Satan took it over he said but brother
[1:24:41] we are waiting for the manifestation of
[1:24:44] the sons of God who will come back and
[1:24:46] will take it over again that's why the
[1:24:49] devil hates you is because you are in
[1:24:51] the jeans seed line amen of God who
[1:24:55] created Adam Oh Glory to God and now
[1:24:58] you're in manifestation by the revealing
[1:25:01] of the word to walk up to the devil and

[1:25:38] the pyramid gets up to the top when the
[1:25:40] full sons of God will be manifested when
[1:25:44] the power of God brother Noah will walk

[1:26:43] from the devil what he took from them
[1:26:46] every Power that Satan's got you will
[1:26:49] take it away from
[1:26:51] him
[1:26:53] in other words you will change from
[1:26:55] being powerless to being powerful and he
[1:26:59] will become powerless Grace Tabernacle
[1:27:02] If I Was the Devil I would fight this

[1:27:38] defeat it but he is defeated and we are

[1:28:39] unlimited resources I'm swimming in the
[1:28:42] unsearchable
[1:28:44] [Applause]
[1:28:46] riches make the devil powerless and you
[1:28:50] become powerful and walk up to that
[1:28:53] devil and take back every
[1:28:57] Power now I know what that devil says
[1:28:59] brother Xavier he says you don't have a
[1:29:01] right to take it back but I happen to
[1:29:03] believe a prophet who said it belonged
[1:29:05] to you before it belonged to
[1:29:07] him come on brother Mark we're not
[1:29:10] taking back something that didn't belong
[1:29:11] to us we're taking back what was always
[1:29:15] well I feel good on that point amen I'm
[1:29:17] not stealing the shout I'm taking the
[1:29:20] shout back I'm not stealing the
[1:29:22] anointing I'm taking the anointing back
[1:29:24] come on that devil says don't you take
[1:29:26] your babies from me I will take them
[1:29:29] from him because they never belong to
[1:29:31] him they always belong to God and as
[1:29:33] long as I've got adoption Authority in
[1:29:36] my body I'm going to overcome that Devil
[1:29:39] by the manifestation of the revelation
[1:29:42] of the word of God in the age I'm living
[1:29:46] [Applause]
[1:29:47] in Hallelujah go right back to Genesis
[1:29:51] to the original
[1:29:53] what is it now the world nature is
[1:29:55] groaning and crying for it everything's
[1:29:58] moving for it for the
[1:30:00] manifestation of the sons of God when
[1:30:03] true Sons born Sons filled
[1:30:09] Sons Church give me some preaching room
[1:30:12] when born Sons true Sons field
[1:30:19] Sons they're coming they're coming
[1:30:23] they're coming that's why you can't get
[1:30:24] no power overcome it's CA the devil's
[1:30:27] convinced you they're coming and blinded
[1:30:29] you to the Revelation you are
[1:30:32] them come on they're not coming they're
[1:30:36] here born sons are here sister Joyce
[1:30:40] filled sons are here true sons are
[1:30:44] here now the problem of God said true
[1:30:46] Sons born Sons filled Sons
[1:30:50] speak and there word is backed I believe
[1:30:54] we're on the border of it right
[1:30:58] now
[1:31:00] 1960 brother Jared we was on the border
[1:31:02] of
[1:31:05] it brother Wesley how big can that
[1:31:07] border
[1:31:08] be if we was on the border of it in
[1:31:12] 1960 I believe brother Randall I can say
[1:31:15] tonight we're in the land of it
[1:31:19] now if we were on the border the spoken
[1:31:22] word in the 60s can I not say what Caleb
[1:31:25] said can I not steal you tonight and say
[1:31:28] we're now well aable to overcome the
[1:31:31] devil that tried to keep us at kades
[1:31:34] barnea we're well able tonight to go
[1:31:37] into the
[1:31:38] land now come on church when we get in
[1:31:41] the land we're not just going to stand
[1:31:42] there and look at everything in the land
[1:31:44] but God brought us in the land to
[1:31:46] possess the land and whatever is in the
[1:31:49] land we have a right to accept
[1:31:54] it I'm preaching to you we have the
[1:31:57] right to go in the land and access what
[1:32:00] is in there that we're air to you know
[1:32:03] why because the Bible said that M I'm
[1:32:06] running out of time but Matthew 21 the
[1:32:09] Bible says that the people were standing
[1:32:11] around and they were under expectation
[1:32:14] of the son s o n of
[1:32:18] God they were waiting for his arrival
[1:32:21] Matthew 21 calls it the triumphal entry
[1:32:24] of Jesus into the city but can I move
[1:32:27] from Matthew 21 and say but we're now in
[1:32:30] Romans
[1:32:32] 8 were they're not under the arrival of
[1:32:36] the S so n of God he's already arrived
[1:32:39] brother Morgan now the world is
[1:32:44] charged now I know I know you're going
[1:32:46] to f I'm Plum slap
[1:32:48] crazy but can I tell you somebody that
[1:32:51] pulls harder than
[1:32:53] you testing one
[1:32:56] two can I tell you somebody that out
[1:32:59] pulls you
[1:33:01] all can I tell you who they are you
[1:33:04] ready it's some trees out
[1:33:08] there oh you said brother Andrew you
[1:33:10] just going to call some I'm talking
[1:33:12] about
[1:33:14] nature right now when you all get quiet

[1:33:19] it right now when you all want say Amen
[1:33:22] that you can overcome it the tree scream
[1:33:24] out Matt preach it
[1:33:26] anyhow come on church because they're
[1:33:30] waiting for you to come to the
[1:33:32] manifestation of your position so they
[1:33:35] can go back to their original
[1:33:41] position the prophet of God said it is
[1:33:43] very apparent that she ought to be
[1:33:45] called the body of Christ for whereas

[1:37:38] adoption in Galatians 2:4 when the
[1:37:41] fullness of time was come amen God sent
[1:37:44] forth his son made of a woman made under
[1:37:47] the law to redeem them that were under
[1:37:49] the law that we might receive receive

[1:37:55] having predestinated
[1:37:58] us unto the adoption of children by
[1:38:02] Jesus Christ to himself according to the
[1:38:06] good pleasure of his will adoption part
[1:38:08] two he said now can we say what brother

[1:39:00] the manifestation of the word of God in
[1:39:03] your position showing the devil who you

[1:39:09] that the purpose of God according to
[1:39:12] election might
[1:39:15] sit might bow down to the things of the
[1:39:18] world no that you're according to
[1:39:21] election might stand not of works but of
[1:39:26] him that calleth can I read you another
[1:39:28] one Romans 11:28 as concerning the
[1:39:31] gospel they are enemies for your sake

[1:43:56] Peter
[1:43:57] 1:10 I'm coming
[1:44:02] down give diligence to make your calling
[1:44:05] an election sure for if you do these
[1:44:09] things can we say that together ye shall
[1:44:13] never fall look at this word election it
[1:44:17] is the act of picking out or choosing
[1:44:19] are you ready for this
[1:44:21] it is used of the act of God's Free Will
[1:44:24] by wh now this is a Bible definition by
[1:44:27] which before the foundation of the world
[1:44:30] he decreed His blessings to certain
[1:44:36] persons so oh God so in other words here
[1:44:40] you are Matt in the
[1:44:42] end and I'm going to go as far as I can
[1:44:45] over
[1:44:46] here to show God in the beginning
[1:44:51] now Sister Karine here's the blessing
[1:44:54] there's the recipient he has been
[1:44:56] elected to receive
[1:44:58] it there's a lot of distance between me
[1:45:01] and
[1:45:04] him but he's the only one that can
[1:45:07] receive this so if it's elected for him
[1:45:11] no matter how far away he is if I had
[1:45:14] time I'd make a better illustration I'd
[1:45:16] put a lot a bunch of these young boys
[1:45:17] between me and him and show you that I
[1:45:19] could get through all of them I'm
[1:45:20] breaking ain't I I could get through all
[1:45:22] of them and still get to him in other
[1:45:25] words nothing between the time that I
[1:45:28] chose him and decreed these blessings to
[1:45:31] him could clog up the channel between he
[1:45:33] and I that could stop him from receiving
[1:45:37] what I
[1:45:38] elected for him to receive Church of the
[1:45:41] Living God do you realize what all has
[1:45:44] been between you in the beginning
[1:45:45] there's been the Old Testament there's
[1:45:47] been the Patriarchs there's been Israel
[1:45:50] and I'm skipping a bunch there's been
[1:45:51] seven Gentile ages there's been a
[1:45:54] crucifixion there's been there's been
[1:45:56] all kinds of things but here you are in
[1:45:58] the end
[1:46:01] time and nothing brother could defeat
[1:46:04] this Revelation from getting to your
[1:46:06] vessel because before the foundation of
[1:46:09] the world God decreed that you would
[1:46:12] receive this
[1:46:16] blessing oh I wish I was a preacher
[1:46:18] right now predestination will not be
[1:46:21] defeated election will not be defeated
[1:46:23] for knowledge will not be
[1:46:26] defeated are y'all ready for this God by
[1:46:29] predestination looks back to forn
[1:46:31] knowledge and for knowledge looks to
[1:46:36] destination yes sir I'm skipping over a
[1:46:39] bunch of good stuff but can I say this
[1:46:42] second Peter 1 Peter 1:1 I'm going to
[1:46:44] close on this point Peter remember we
[1:46:48] talked about him an apostle Jesus Jesus
[1:46:50] Christ to The Strangers scattered
[1:46:54] throughout I'm glad my name is Andrew
[1:46:56] verse two
[1:46:58] elect according to the forn knowledge of
[1:47:02] God the
[1:47:04] Father what are those words through
[1:47:08] sanctification of the spirit unto The
[1:47:12] Obedience and the sprinkling of the
[1:47:15] blood of Jesus Christ Grace be unto you
[1:47:18] and peace be multiplied brother BR said
[1:47:20] in other words God in order to be God he
[1:47:23] had to know everything he had to know
[1:47:25] what the end was from the
[1:47:28] beginning I write unto you young man
[1:47:32] because you have believed in the
[1:47:34] beginning that your word shall abide in
[1:47:36] you and you shall overcome the wicked
[1:47:40] one can I say this to you the goodness
[1:47:43] of God y'all know that song the goodness
[1:47:45] of God the goodness of God brother
[1:47:48] Wesley is the forn knowledge of God
[1:47:50] the goodness of God is the forn
[1:47:52] knowledge of God now in the cor of this
[1:47:54] time he can can I can I show this to you
[1:47:58] in the calling of this time the going
[1:48:00] out on this I was born of a very humble
[1:48:03] parent a very humble home brother Matt I
[1:48:06] read this in your office D about shouted
[1:48:07] all over the place I have no education
[1:48:10] at all when I made that remark a while
[1:48:13] ago about education I wasn't trying to
[1:48:15] take crutches from ignorance but what
[1:48:17] I'm trying to say is that it doesn't
[1:48:19] take education to know God it takes a
[1:48:23] submissive heart to know God and I was
[1:48:26] raised poor I was raised in irreligious
[1:48:29] family but from the very time I was born
[1:48:32] something happened not of my goodness
[1:48:35] not of my parents goodness but by the
[1:48:37] for knowledge of God see he brought it I
[1:48:41] don't know
[1:48:42] why I don't know why he brought it he
[1:48:45] says I guess to show that he can choose
[1:48:49] what he wishes to whether it come out of
[1:48:51] the Vatican City or taken out of the
[1:48:53] rubbish sheep he can make it what he
[1:48:55] wants to regardless of where it come
[1:48:57] from oh Grace Tabernacle put your
[1:49:00] shouting shoes on some of y'all didn't
[1:49:03] come out of religious families some of
[1:49:04] you didn't come out of good backgrounds
[1:49:06] but God who is rich in Mercy through the
[1:49:09] election by adoption through
[1:49:12] predestination he claimed your soul by a
[1:49:15] seed and he chose you you know why he
[1:49:17] chose you Destiny to show he can take
[1:49:19] somebody
[1:49:20] and make something out of
[1:49:22] him he chose us brother Xavier it don't
[1:49:25] matter what the world says about us if
[1:49:28] God choses he can take something from
[1:49:30] the Vatican or he can take something
[1:49:32] from the rubbish Heap and when God gets
[1:49:34] done with it he's going to have a living
[1:49:36] breathing walking
[1:49:40] manifested
[1:49:42] Overcomer did y'all hear me Overcomer

[1:52:02] overcomer now now either you believe it
[1:52:05] or

[1:52:10] look at John 3:16 God so the world he
[1:52:12] gave his only begotten son that who
[1:52:13] soever believeth in him shall not perish
[1:52:15] but have everlasting
[1:52:17] life second Peter 3:9 the Lord is not
[1:52:20] slack concerning his promises some men
[1:52:21] count slackness but is longsuffering to
[1:52:24] us word not willing that any should
[1:52:26] perish but that all should come to
[1:52:28] repentance Jude 1:4 certain men crept in
[1:52:31] unawares who were before of old ordained
[1:52:34] to this condemnation listen at the
[1:52:36] prophet but just individuals out of the
[1:52:38] church who's predestinated to eternal
[1:52:42] life they'll
[1:52:43] [Music]
[1:52:47] come God's not willing that any should
[1:52:50] perish he doesn't want anyone to perish
[1:52:54] God but at the beginning of the
[1:52:59] beginning brother Matt at the beginning
[1:53:01] of the beginning at the beginning
[1:53:04] Brother David Paul of the beginning of
[1:53:06] the days The World God knew exactly who
[1:53:10] would be saved and who would not he
[1:53:12] didn't want people to be lost it's not
[1:53:13] as will they didn't should be lost but
[1:53:14] it's your will to save everybody but he
[1:53:16] knew from the beginning who would and
[1:53:17] who would not now in other words I said
[1:53:20] like this brother R said you fight your
[1:53:22] way to
[1:53:25] hell you fight your way to hell can I
[1:53:27] sit you like the prophet said he said
[1:53:30] can I can I buy five
[1:53:32] minutes it's not easy for a person to go
[1:53:35] to hell he said man fights his way to
[1:53:38] Hell the first lie you ever told you
[1:53:40] knew it was wrong the first cigarette
[1:53:42] you ever smoked you knew it was wrong
[1:53:44] the first evil you did you know it was
[1:53:45] wrong but in your conscience told you it
[1:53:48] was wrong but you continually run
[1:53:49] through that red light run over the
[1:53:51] barricades you want to do it anyhow show
[1:53:53] your some big eye but remember you fight
[1:53:54] your way to hell it's not easy to go to
[1:53:57] hell can I say this Jesus was God's
[1:54:01] barricade between a person in hell and
[1:54:04] the prophet said now I'm a man so he was
[1:54:06] a man he was the son of God begotten
[1:54:08] virgin born I'm a sinner saved by grace
[1:54:10] his grace saved me won't you stand your
[1:54:13] feet with us tonight rest yourself
[1:54:16] listen at this so through that he opened
[1:54:20] up a channel by
[1:54:22] [Music]
[1:54:25] election by for
[1:54:27] knowledge he opened a channel in my
[1:54:30] heart to give himself a place that he
[1:54:33] could work out to you
[1:54:36] people brother at the beginning of the
[1:54:39] beginning God decreed a blessing of
[1:54:41] Revelation 10:7 Malachi 4 Revelation
[1:54:44] 3:14 to a prophet in the end time by the
[1:54:47] name of William brandom and Mark brother
[1:54:49] Mark look at all that was between the
[1:54:51] beginning at the beginning to the time
[1:54:52] he received that but election brought it
[1:54:55] right to
[1:54:56] [Music]
[1:54:59] him probably God said it's your faith
[1:55:02] that does it not mine I couldn't do
[1:55:04] it can I can I leave you with one more
[1:55:07] powerful one brother BR said Jesus never
[1:55:10] come to Earth and died just in vain how
[1:55:12] many can say
[1:55:14] amen he never taken a chance to come to
[1:55:17] Earth Jesus wouldn't have did that God
[1:55:20] don't run his office business in heaven
[1:55:21] like that Loosely Jesus came to the
[1:55:24] Earth to die for a purpose and not to
[1:55:26] just see if it'd be somebody but God
[1:55:29] before the foundation of the world
[1:55:32] forsaw the whole thing do you believe it
[1:55:35] he foresaw it by for knowledge he forew
[1:55:37] it therefore he knew there was going to
[1:55:41] be a church called out without spotter
[1:55:43] wrinkle and there had to be preparations
[1:55:46] made to save that church so he sent
[1:55:49] Jesus Jesus and not just perhaps
[1:55:51] somebody might be saved but he knew who
[1:55:53] was going to be saved are y'all ready
[1:55:55] for this he would have a people called
[1:55:58] out and you are
[1:56:04] they you are they he would have a people
[1:56:09] that would believe in Divine Healing and
[1:56:11] you are they God knew it he knew there
[1:56:14] would be unbelievers there was then he
[1:56:16] knew there would be he forew it so
[1:56:18] therefore he could forsake would be that
[1:56:20] way and he fornew that there would be
[1:56:22] somebody who would believe it so he sent
[1:56:25] Jesus for those who would believe it and
[1:56:27] here they are today gathered here at one
[1:56:31] spot to accept what God forne would take
[1:56:36] place
[1:56:38] am God made a preparation for those who
[1:56:43] would
[1:56:44] believe and you're a part of that
[1:56:46] preparation God forne before the world
[1:56:49] every was formed that these days would
[1:56:51] be here that's the reason he could
