[44:42] the day that I called upon thee thou
[44:45] said us fear not oh Lord thou H has
[44:48] pleaded the causes of my soul and thou
[44:51] Hast redeemed my life I don't read I
[44:52] want to read verse 58 and the Amplified

[44:56] pleaded my soul's cause you have guided
[44:59] my way and you have protected me you

[45:13] Vengeance and all their imaginations
[45:15] against me thou has heard their reproach
[45:18] oh Lord and all their imaginations
[45:20] against me the lips of those that rose
[45:22] up against me and their device against
[45:24] me all the day behold they're sitting
[45:27] down and they're rising up I am their
[45:29] music and again I like to read this
[45:31] verse verse 63 and the Amplified look at
[45:34] their sitting and their Rising their
[45:36] actions and secret counsels I am their
[45:40] mocking song the subject of their
[45:43] ridicule verse 64 Render unto them a
[45:46] recompense O Lord according to the works
[45:48] of their hand give them sorrow of heart
[45:51] thy curses unto them persecute and
[45:54] Destroy them in anger from under the
[45:57] heavens of the Lord amen we let you be
[46:01] seated this
[46:08] [Music]
[46:13] evening as I was driving up here these
[46:15] words and I'd like to speak to you on
[46:17] these words he has taken your case just
[46:20] taking your case these words were
[46:22] running through my mind and you know
[46:24] it's kind of pushing it out ping it out
[46:26] cuz I've been been living a very very
[46:28] busy life we just got through with our
[46:30] meetings and and had a lot of people
[46:32] left over taking care of them and then
[46:34] preached last night at home and and then
[46:36] on the road today to he so then we got
[46:38] to head back home for the weekend cuz
[46:40] I'm leaving for Europe next week so got
[46:42] a lot going on and so you start feeling
[46:44] something but yet you try to say well
[46:46] Lord I I got a lot of things I've
[46:47] already got ready you know but the Lord
[46:50] sometimes he just pushes you into a
[46:52] place and so I I know better than to
[46:54] resist that voice and but I I I reading
[46:57] here and looking upon this thought amen
[47:00] the Lord I called upon thy name oh Lord
[47:03] out of a low dungeon and thou heard my
[47:05] voice I I'm so thankful that we have a
[47:08] God who hears our voice and hears our
[47:10] call amen that we're not just crying out
[47:12] into the air or just going up into the
[47:15] through the ceiling sometimes it feels
[47:16] that way but God hears our cry and it
[47:19] says you drew near the day that I called
[47:21] thee amen and thou said us fear not oh
[47:25] Lord thou has pleaded the causes of my
[47:27] soul and verse 59 he says judge thou my
[47:30] cause and and we we we can look in John
[47:33] chap 14 and verse 16 and he said I will
[47:36] pray the father and he'll give you
[47:38] another comforter that he may abide with
[47:40] you forever and I I got to look into at
[47:42] this word comforter and this comforter
[47:44] means also a helper or an advocate or in
[47:48] modern transl in modern translations but
[47:51] in the original Greek it means someone
[47:53] who is summoned or called to one side
[47:56] especially in order to help someone who
[47:59] pleads another cause before another's
[48:01] cause before a judge it is a counsel for
[48:04] defense a legal assistant an advocate an
[48:08] intercessor and I'm so thankful we serve
[48:10] a God who knows how to intercede on our
[48:12] behalf when we're sick he knows what it
[48:15] was like to be sick when we're under
[48:17] pressure he knows what it's like to be
[48:18] under pressure when when we're going
[48:20] through trials of life he already knows
[48:22] cuz he was ATT tempted in all things so
[48:25] knows exactly what it's like to walk in
[48:27] a human body he knows what it's like to
[48:30] face the Mind battles that you'll face
[48:32] today or the pressures he knows what
[48:34] it's like for friends to leave you and
[48:36] people to turn against you and all kinds
[48:38] of things to happen because he came down

[52:28] attorney that was good a shrewd attorney
[52:31] You' feel that your case maybe was a you
[52:33] can relax a little bit because you had
[52:34] the right man on the job the right
[52:36] attorney but still there would be a
[52:38] question would this attorney be able to
[52:41] change the judge's idea or change the
[52:44] jury's mind about you and if that
[52:46] attorney was a shrewd speaking and
[52:48] knowing the laws could change that and
[52:50] complete your case and prove that you
[52:52] should live but yet in all of is great
[52:55] Authority and his great speech and the
[52:57] impression he can put upon the jury or
[52:59] the judge you might get to relax for a
[53:02] few minutes but still there would be a
[53:04] question in your mind can he do
[53:07] it can he say the right words can he
[53:10] make the right case can it plead my
[53:12] cause would I be innocent when I leave
[53:15] here would I have life when I leave here

[53:27] your
[53:29] attorney amen the one who could have
[53:32] said guilty the one who can say go to
[53:34] hell the one that could put you in

[53:42] your moment in your
[53:45] life hallelujah amen if you're a sinner

[54:01] you are

[54:08] to take your case there's no attorney
[54:10] could do it but God became

[54:18] the earth that could get you out of your
[54:19] sin get you out of your nonsense get you
[54:22] out of the wrongs that you have done but
[54:24] God God became man the very one who
[54:27] could judge you became the one who stood

[54:33] you the very one to put you in prison
[54:36] and put you in hell and say you've done
[54:39] it you deserve it it's the very one that
[54:41] says not
[54:47] guilty

[54:49] Hall I think about the woman that was
[54:51] caught in the very Act of adultery and

[54:58] the one that fulfilled the
[55:00] law amen the law stood as a judge but he
[55:03] stood as her attorney he came to fulfill
[55:06] it now the judge became the attorney and
[55:09] he standing before them and he begins to
[55:11] write in the
[55:14] sand I don't know maybe maybe maybe you
[55:17] don't know what he was writing I believe
[55:19] that he was writing their
[55:21] sins reminding them they needed just as
[55:23] much grace as she needed
[55:25] it amen and he wrote it and one rock
[55:28] began to fall after another and one
[55:30] accuser walked away after another and

[55:37] accusers they were all gone he had come
[55:40] and taken her case amen he took it so
[55:43] far he said woman where is our accuser

[56:00] all born in sin all sh in iniquity all
[56:03] going down to a devil's hell and the law
[56:06] said we should go but he stepped in our
[56:09] path and he said this one's not guilty
[56:12] this one's not guilty this one's not
[56:15] guilty this one's not guilty I have
[56:18] wrote it all
[56:22] out in this place the judge himself

[56:33] own law in his own hands and paid the
[56:35] price how much more secure should we

[1:15:11] dismiss no more case to it oh Lord
[1:15:16] hallelujah no more case to
[1:15:18] it the tokens been
[1:15:21] applied thank you Lord death begins to
[1:15:24] Smite against the door that has the
[1:15:25] token it has no
[1:15:28] control buddy I love that right there oh
[1:15:32] yeah it has no control the token is
[1:15:34] applied only the token is recognized he
[1:15:37] did that so the token could come to the
[1:15:40] Token was God's own life and when God
[1:15:43] made the first man he made him a son and
[1:15:46] the son was so corrupt he listened to
[1:15:48] his wife instead of God and the woman
[1:15:50] listened to the devil instead of her
[1:15:51] husband and when they did that that they
[1:15:53] corrupted together that brought a
[1:15:54] pollution to the whole world and they
[1:15:57] have to now bring children to the world
[1:15:58] and the fruit of the midst of the tree
[1:15:59] cannot be touched and when it was they
[1:16:01] brought sin upon themselves and the
[1:16:03] whole human race that was born was now
[1:16:06] born in sin there's no way to come out
[1:16:08] other than that and then God came down
[1:16:12] there is the only way to get him back
[1:16:14] that's the only way to get back a son
[1:16:16] how can he do it when his all law on law
[1:16:19] stood there and said he's condemned but
[1:16:21] the father himself became one of
[1:16:26] us see he offered a substitute and he
[1:16:29] put a woolly lamb skin over them but he
[1:16:32] said this is only prophesied of what's
[1:16:34] to come amen we know what it was like
[1:16:37] David had lust in his heart and he would
[1:16:39] repent before God but that lust still
[1:16:41] remained because the blood of that
[1:16:43] sacrifice could not take the case it
[1:16:47] could cover the case it could it could
[1:16:48] apply covering over but the sin was
[1:16:51] still there
[1:16:53] yes I want you to understand something
[1:16:56] taking the case means case dismissed it
[1:16:59] means there ain't no sin no more it
[1:17:01] ain't just a covering over there that's
[1:17:04] you know you can put a covering over
[1:17:05] this phone and you say you try to say
[1:17:07] all you want to the phone's not there
[1:17:09] but it's still
[1:17:10] there amen it's just a covering of
[1:17:13] that's what the lamb the wooded lamb did
[1:17:15] it put a covering over lust it put a
[1:17:17] covering over temper it put a covering
[1:17:19] over adultery but it was still there but
[1:17:21] when this lamb came
[1:17:25] Hallelujah why why was it still there
[1:17:27] because the life of that lamb could not
[1:17:30] come back into the
[1:17:32] worshiper he couldn't take the case he
[1:17:35] could cover it but he couldn't take
[1:17:40] it but this man came this one came out
[1:17:44] of heaven and he robed himself in
[1:17:46] humanity and it so defied human
[1:17:49] reasoning that they looked at him said
[1:17:51] there's no way this could be God there's
[1:17:53] no way this could be here if thou be if
[1:17:56] thou be if th the devil looked at him
[1:17:58] and
[1:17:59] Di he knew how great God
[1:18:04] was God would come and wrap himself in a
[1:18:08] little tiny blood Z yes be born in a
[1:18:11] virgin
[1:18:13] womb he come forth you know his first
[1:18:15] words on Earth you know what Jesus's
[1:18:18] first words were on
[1:18:21] Earth
[1:18:26] true come on
[1:18:29] somebody just like
[1:18:32] you he didn't come speaking in tongues
[1:18:35] and authority and all that no sir he
[1:18:37] come
[1:18:39] why it was Jehovah running down the
[1:18:41] streets it was Jehovah skinning his
[1:18:43] knees it was Jehovah with a headache it
[1:18:46] was Jehovah sitting on the side of the

[1:33:51] why changed about 2 hours or hour and a
[1:33:53] half before the service I don't know but
[1:33:56] I know one time this this first of this
[1:33:58] year I was in a real tough situation
[1:34:02] financially and I'm trying to figure how
[1:34:04] I'm going to do it what I'm going to do
[1:34:07] and I'm crying out to the Lord because
[1:34:09] God has spoke to a man by the name of
[1:34:11] Ron Spencer when I was about to jump off
[1:34:13] into some business one time he didn't
[1:34:15] know nothing about it I went to see him
[1:34:17] very short part of this condensed
[1:34:20] version and I went to see him he didn't
[1:34:22] know nothing about it and he comes to me
[1:34:24] and he said the Lord spoke to me and he
[1:34:26] said tell you not to go into business he
[1:34:29] said I am going to take care of him he
[1:34:31] is my servant thank you Lord so I backed
[1:34:34] out of everything and I walked away from
[1:34:36] it all had had what I thought was a good
[1:34:39] opportunity but God saw something
[1:34:40] different CU he knew where I could be
[1:34:43] tested and tried at
[1:34:46] right so just this year my wife has has
[1:34:49] to go in for MRI and there's health
[1:34:51] problems is starting to pile up and
[1:34:53] bills and all that kind of stuff and
[1:34:55] then other issues is going on and I I'm
[1:34:57] in my office crying out God do You Hear
[1:34:59] My Cry do you know what I'm going
[1:35:02] through I believe you do Lord but just
[1:35:03] help me stay in the place that you have
[1:35:06] predetermined me to be don't let me get
[1:35:08] out of my place don't let me get out of
[1:35:10] my spot to where where you want me I I
[1:35:13] want to stay where your your will is
[1:35:15] where because I know if I stay in his

[1:35:20] calls oh somebody amen if I stay where
[1:35:24] God wants me then he will take care of
[1:35:27] me that's why my my dad was a young man
[1:35:30] he wouldn't let anybody ever ask me are
[1:35:32] you a preacher he don't ask him that
[1:35:34] don't even put that in his mind he said
[1:35:36] because man don't make a man a preacher
[1:35:38] right I know that's a problem right now
[1:35:40] we got is a lot of man-made preachers
[1:35:43] pastor called Daddy called but not God
[1:35:45] call that's why we got all the nonsense
[1:35:47] we got going on but if God calls you got
[1:35:50] to take care of
[1:35:51] [Applause]
[1:35:53] if God calls you God to open the doors
[1:35:56] you ain't got to kick them down you
[1:35:58] ain't got to push them down you ain't
[1:35:59] got to blow down you ain't got to do
[1:36:01] nothing God will open the door if your

[1:37:28] saying Lord help me help me help me he
[1:37:30] said hey boy go to the mailbox it's

[1:38:04] [Music]
[1:38:06] before he's taking your
[1:38:10] case you make this personal tonight
[1:38:12] because it's real easy sometimes to see
[1:38:14] God well he help that one here to take
[1:38:17] your
[1:38:18] case everybody say my case
[1:38:23] my case
[1:38:24] amen we see here life could come now
[1:38:28] upon a
[1:38:31] worshiper my there's so many things we
[1:38:33] can go through let's go on down
[1:38:37] here brother BR would talk about this
[1:38:40] about the sacrifice he said he said see
[1:38:43] that sacrifice that laid upon that altar
[1:38:45] that worshipper had to walk up there
[1:38:47] Abel he had to walk up there and hack at
[1:38:49] his throat and blood was few all over he
[1:38:51] said what was it going on he said the
[1:38:53] worshipper had to be identified with the
[1:38:56] sacrifice so the sacrifice could take
[1:38:58] his CA in his case this is exactly how
[1:39:02] people don't they they want the they
[1:39:04] want the lamb but they don't want to
[1:39:06] identify on they don't want blood all
[1:39:09] over them they don't want a messy
[1:39:14] birth and I don't care how you skim it
[1:39:17] slice it dice it cut it up and put it on
[1:39:19] a barbecue if you want the New Birth
[1:39:21] it's a
[1:39:23] mess it ain't no confession and just
[1:39:26] profess and say I believe the message no
[1:39:28] sir that is not the new
[1:39:32] birth
[1:39:35] amen amen that's why we got a lot of
[1:39:37] rotten
[1:39:38] eggs because we're taking an
[1:39:39] intellectual conception instead of the
[1:39:41] baptism of the Holy Ghost the seal that
[1:39:44] comes on the
[1:39:45] inside he's the comforter the guide that
[1:39:48] shall lead you into all
[1:39:50] truth a't going to know all truth unless
[1:39:52] you got the GU to lead you in all
[1:39:54] truth get it backwards but he said once
[1:39:57] we have become identified he said then
[1:39:59] no I no devil no sickness no death no
[1:40:02] sorrow no anything else can bother you
[1:40:04] as long as you hold that token over it
[1:40:06] you're unchanging Faith Paul Sayes that
[1:40:08] and forms the form of Jesus Christ the
[1:40:11] image that you're walking in today he
[1:40:13] said when I see the token I'll pass over
[1:40:15] here it's a sign it's a sign that the
[1:40:18] price has been paid Jesus Paid It All
[1:40:21] and you received it from him and you're
[1:40:23] holding the token in your hand and you
[1:40:25] have the Assurance of Resurrection you
[1:40:27] have the Assurance of everything you
[1:40:29] have need
[1:40:30] of and this journey is provided by that
[1:40:34] token that's paid
[1:40:37] for sir you had to buy the ticket to get
[1:40:40] on the airplane he paid the price for
[1:40:42] you to
[1:40:43] [Music]
[1:40:44] Goen there's no devil can stand before
[1:40:47] it there's nothing can stand before it
[1:40:49] because God has accepted it and you hold
[1:40:52] that token in your hand the price has
[1:40:53] been paid it's a positive token on thank
[1:40:57] you Lord said when you're in a court
[1:40:59] when a trial set you know that you're
[1:41:00] facing death here in the nightclub man
[1:41:03] that just killed this Mr oswal you know
[1:41:05] you were facing that something similar
[1:41:07] to it you'd hire the best attorney you
[1:41:09] got I would if I knew my life was at
[1:41:11] stake I'd hire the best attorney I could
[1:41:13] find every person would it's the only
[1:41:15] sensible thing to do but in this case
[1:41:17] you know you're going to Electric care
[1:41:19] you're going to be separated from your
[1:41:21] family whatever the attorney is trying
[1:41:23] to plead your case the attorney has got
[1:41:25] to make it so clear to the judge that
[1:41:27] the judge will see the justice of your
[1:41:29] act oh God if the people could only see
[1:41:32] this our judge is our attorney the case
[1:41:35] is settled it's all over the same one as
[1:41:38] judge is our attorney the case is
[1:41:40] settled we have the token both judge and
[1:41:43] attorney is the same
[1:41:45] person when God was made flesh and dwelt
[1:41:48] among us our judge became our ET
[1:41:51] [Applause]
[1:41:53] turning the case is settled and the Holy
[1:41:56] Ghost is here for a token you're ready
[1:41:59] to pass from here to the land
[1:42:02] be thank you
[1:42:05] Lord he would say in the church age book
[1:42:08] he said where is there what is there to
[1:42:09] fear the Judgment that fell on him on
[1:42:12] the cross at the grave when he descended
[1:42:14] was for us he absorbed the first brunt
[1:42:16] of the wound of sin and there is now no
[1:42:18] condemnation to them which are Christ
[1:42:20] Jesus for assurity for assurity our
[1:42:23] attorney is our judge he's both attorney
[1:42:27] and judge as judge the case is settled
[1:42:30] it is finished there is now no for
[1:42:33] therefore no condemnation why should the
[1:42:36] church fear what promises he ever failed
[1:42:39] to manifest why should he fear the
[1:42:41] punishment of death it has all been
[1:42:43] overcome here is a mighty conqueror he
[1:42:46] is the one that conquered Both Worlds of
[1:42:48] the seen and the Unseen he is is
[1:42:50] descended now and descended above all
[1:42:53] unto him has been given a name that's
[1:42:55] above every name yes he conquered death
[1:42:57] he conquered hell he conquered the grave
[1:43:00] and has the keys what he looses is loose
[1:43:03] and what he binds is binds there's no
[1:43:05] changing of it there's no conqueror
[1:43:07] before him and there's none behind him
[1:43:10] he alone is savior he alone is Redeemer
[1:43:13] he is the only God the Lord Jesus Christ
[1:43:16] is his
[1:43:18] name Hallelujah but don't fear John

[1:45:07] too simple for him wasn't Grand enough
[1:45:10] it wasn't great enough and he turned it
[1:45:12] down he walked out to a firing squad and
[1:45:15] died they would judge the case and they
[1:45:17] came back and said a pardon is not a

[2:14:32] Lord I testify he took my
[2:14:36] case he took my case I don't know if
[2:14:39] there's somebody that be Hest and say
[2:14:41] brother mat that man came all the way
[2:14:42] from Louisiana to speak to my heart
[2:14:44] would somebody God bless you people all
[2:14:46] over the building God my case said he
[2:14:49] knew you was going to be here he knew
[2:14:51] who was going to be SP he knew what
[2:14:53] they'd have to say why because it isn't
[2:14:55] man it's God and he's working with his
[2:14:58] people but is it wonderful that he would
[2:15:00] stand on our behalf he took our case you
[2:15:04] know I thought brother Timothy he was
[2:15:07] speaking on that thought how that when a
[2:15:10] man goes into trial he said but we have
[2:15:12] a judge and a jury or a judge and an
[2:15:14] attorney that would stand for us you
[2:15:16] know what happens when a case gets
[2:15:18] dismissed but the Tom first the
[2:15:20] prosecutor comes up and he said this is
[2:15:22] all the charges against them but then it
[2:15:25] comes time for the defense to defend and
[2:15:27] it's my favorite part of a of a good
[2:15:29] trial is when that attorney for the
[2:15:32] defense stands up and he says judge I
[2:15:34] plead that we don't even have to put up
[2:15:36] a defense he said I plead that the
[2:15:39] prosecutor has not met their burden see
[2:15:42] we come many times we have a burden
[2:15:44] we're the one feels like we're under
[2:15:46] pressure and we're the one who feels
[2:15:47] like we have we have to have a we have
[2:15:48] to to meet the burden to prove that
[2:15:50] we're saved and prove we're going to
[2:15:51] make a Rapture and prove that we're okay
[2:15:53] and prove that we're filled with the
[2:15:54] Holy Ghost but the case isn't on you the
[2:15:56] case is on the prosecutor see you're
[2:15:59] automatically free you were free when
[2:16:00] you went into court you're free when you
[2:16:02] when the case started you you came there
[2:16:04] free but they have to meet the burden to
[2:16:06] make you guilty we don't have to meet a
[2:16:08] burden to to make us free you already
[2:16:10] free you were born free God set us free
[2:16:13] he made us free by the blood of Jesus
[2:16:15] Christ and I plead tonight our brother
[2:16:18] said when the evidence was presented the
[2:16:20] prosecutor has not met the burden he
[2:16:23] didn't meet the burden to put enough
[2:16:25] evidence to make you guilty you're still
[2:16:28] free isn't it wonderful to be be free
