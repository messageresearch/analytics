we could ever have or desire the desire of the Nations the desire of the world maybe they don't know what they're hungering for but they hunger for God even the man that is down in the lowest gutter of hell and down in the in the depths of sin and the reason why he's doing that is because he's got a hunger for God his soul is thirsting for a living God you can't satisfi it with the things of the world the only way you can satisfy is to know Jesus Christ amen and I tell you if you don't know him you want to come to know him to know him is life amen can we just bow our heads together maybe while our heads are bowed tonight that you got a need in your life in your heart and you just say Jesus Don't Pass Me By come speak to me I I need you to speak directly to me Lord tonight you you see

they need an answer for I pray God that even if it's necessary that you cause me to even leave my notes and the things that I have here and and just to just to be able to stop and minister to that one person because your God is an individual God that you will minister to the individual need I pray Lord for those that need healing that they'll see you as Healers tonight and deliver I pray Lord for the the Holy Spirit just to have preeminence in this place I give myself to you Lord to be anointed by your spirit to let your spirit Speak Lord may you give a hearing ear to the people and they hear what the spirit says tonight do the work of Grace Lord in lives Lord I want to thank you for this church this Tabernacle here under the name of Grace the favor of God I think of your Prophet speaking about Miss Grace the elect lady and we thank you for this portion of the elect lady that assembles here in in this northern part of Arkansas not just just church alone but all over lord in the in the vicinity and around and Lord you've got many little Works down through here you you've used this area greatly for your kingdom and we want to thank you for Lord every Lighthouse that is among us and we're here to support them and encourage them and to tell them to press the battle I I ask God that you would bless us tonight in your presence in the name of Jesus as we read your word Lord will you bless it to our hearts in jesus' name amen amen God bless you it's sure good to be together with you tonight be in the house of the Lord thank you I appreciate the wonderful music and the worship to the Lord don't you like that I believe he likes that he dwells in the Praises of his people my hav we've been blessed the last few Services here these last two days here in the wonderful sermons from Brother Andrew Glover brother Wayne Lawson and I I think we could probably just say amen and go home and we would have already been blessed and it would have been worth coming for so you know we but we're here tonight we got a couple of more services uh together and uh we just want to obey the Lord and let the Lord speak to us and amen uh you know we heard the wonderful message on the Breath of God and then last night of tremendous faith building sermon from Brother Wayne and I I'm so glad God's got servants around the world and a bride around the world you know they don't just they're not just at evening light Tabernacle and that's not where the Revival is it's everywhere around the world Amen and we are a part of that great Revival and I'm just really grateful to be here I want to thank brother Matt for this opportunity to come it's uh wonderful to see another Lighthouse here in this area it's a Beacon of Hope for a harbor of refuge and uh we're here just to support you and encourage you as we would any other believers around this in this area you know let's press the battle when brother Matt invited me to this meeting my heart was moved as I remembered so many of you my friends from many many years ago also learning that our brother David Morris was sick in the hospital I I yearned to go and see him and and pray that God will restore him to complete health and renew his strength we need each other amen we need every work of God and we need it uh we need Ministry that is healthy and well to press the battle all the way to the end the book ofs said bless the Lord on my soul and forget not his benefits I'm glad there's benefits and some of the benefits he forgives our iniquities he heals our diseases he redeems our life from destruction crowns us with loving kindness and tender Mercy mercy and he satisfies your mouth with good things so that your youth is renewed like the eagles amen and you I think it was about 1978 about 46 years ago when I was a young man of 24 years old little younger brother Andrew there even you know and I was invited this part of Arkansas to preach for brother Henry darus over at White Oak how how many would would have been in that meeting let me see your hands oh goodness a dozen or more here why you had to be just a child amen well anyway um you know we had some wonderful times together and I think you know how many have crossed the river between Mortal and immortality and are a waiting us on the other side I think of those precious Souls brother and sister darus Sister Bailey that prayer Warrior that prayed for me so many times and so many others and you know uh my wife wife sister Karen was just a girl and she now is there waiting for her change and and how many how many more will cross the The Divide between Time and Eternity I I don't know but one day the last one will cross and God will call a halt to this Mortal season and the ones who there are there will come to be resurrected and we'll see them to be chained in a moment in the twinkling of an eye and I'm here to encourage you tonight to keep pressing the battle Amen to keep moving on you know none of us can grasp the great joy that lays ahead but I'm just going to just say something about that just a moment even if there is no Heaven even if all of life just ends here with our last breath this is this right here the life that we live as Christians makes it heaven on Earth a life of sin makes it hell on Earth that's right and so you know this Earth that you live in for some for some this is the closest they will ever get to heaven and for others this life that they live in as Christians this is the closest will'll ever come to Hell amen so together we'll press on Amen Genesis chapter 18 verse one you've been such a a great audience every night for the brothers that are speaking and and I hope that I won't weary you um I'm not as young as they are it takes me a little longer than them takes me a long Runway to get started do I need do I need that they think this one's a little they got to undress me before I can preach Genesis 18 and verse one that sounds a lot better yeah are you just now here I'm here now you've heard everything okay Genesis 18 and verse one and the Lord appeared unto him in the plains of mammory and he sat in the tent Door In the Heat of the day and he lift up his eyes and and looked and lo three men stood by him and when he saw them he ran to meet them from the tent door and bowed himself toward the ground and said my Lord if now I have found favor in thy sight pass not away I pray thee from thy servant let a little water I pray you be fetched and wash your feet and rest yourself under the tree and I will fetch a morcel of bread and comfort you your heart Hearts after that you shall pass on so therefore you come to your servant and they said so do as I was said and Abraham hastened un the tent unto unto Sarah and said make ready quickly three measures of fine meal needed and make cakes upon the heart and Abraham ran unto the herd and fetched a CA calf tender and good and gave it to the unto a young man and he hasted to dress it and he took butter and milk and the calf which he had dressed and set it before them and he stood by them under the tree and they did eat God bless you you can be seated tonight I'm going to speak to you under the Oaks at mamry the appearing of of Elohim here to Abraham it is the Apex or the summit or the Capstone the highest point of all the appearing and and here it will conclude with the coming of the promised son this is of one of the greatest of all the appearing that God did in that age in that time he' already appeared as elhadi the pouring out of the Holy Ghost as it were and now it crescendos into God manifesting the flesh and this would be the capping off of all the visitations of Elohim God had led him from the ER of the Chans appearing in the land of of of his of his father and and this caused Abram the idol worshipper to start seeking a city whose Builder and maker was God and in all the visitations from the age of 75 whether by voice or whether by dream or by vision of Elohim this now now what we just read tonight is the greatest for God has now come to him manifested in flesh so then this manifestation was more real more physical for it was like the fullness of all the manifestations of divine presence when the word was made flesh as it would be later in Jesus Christ and let me say this tonight that the appearing of God in in this last day is he would tell us that God is a great like a great contractor he actually laid your bodies out here on the Earth every element needed to make your human body so he said what are you made of like petroleum and potass and calcium my body was laying right here upon the Earth and when the Holy Spirit began to bruise or to cool like a dove or like a hen mother over the Earth there was nothing but volcanic eruptions and God moved this old star around the Sun and make make him poish and calcium and he was a great contractor and he was laying out the lumber to build houses and he said our bodies were on the Earth right then amen so you're going to call me a Holy Roller anyhow so you might as well get started that'll make a holy roll out of you to think about that tonight you never originally belonged to the devil your body was never intended for the devil to inhabit you belong to God Amen in the mind of God before the foundation of the world and even your body was already claimed by God before the devil ever come to defile it so when I know that God had me in his mind when he made the Earth he made my body there if he didn't where did it come from amen he sent the Holy Spirit forth said brood of the earth and he began to coup and and the first thing a little poach a little calcium run together a little Easter lily stuck his head up and said that's beautiful and he just kept cing and then out of the ground came birds and out of there came trees and and the animals and then come a man in the image of God and then man sinned and it brought on this sexual Affair that we have now but God is still using his material and he will raise it up again in the last day God cannot be defeated his purpose is perfect just as certain as you are born again why if that Holy Spirit made me what I am without having a choice how much more can he Raise Me Up Again by taking a choice by that same spirit that CS over me I'm the Lord that forgiveth all thine iniquities I am the one that wants to come and live Into You Me Lord yes you I'm calling you I've called you before the foundation of the earth I want to come into you and raise you up to the last day and give you eternal life oh Lord come on and the Holy Spirit comes in and grieve not the holy spirit of God whereby you are sealed to the day of redemption so he said what are you scared about amen think about it your very body belongs to God Amen your soul belongs to God you belong to God Amen God as he said in the four seal is like a big contractor lays all his material out on the earth and then he starts building and remember for there was a grain of seed on the earth before there was a sun that struck the Earth your body was laying on the earth cuz your dust of the Earth you see you are God is the contractor and the way he was going to do it was reach down and get like Adam a little bit of calcium and poish and Cosmic light and and and say there's my other son and then bring up more and then come another and then another you wonder how it would have been if we wouldn't have come through sexual birth that's the way it would have been he' have just gathered another Cosmic light and petroleum and amen and stepped in another right but he said what did Eve do she corrupted that way and brought it through a sexual act and then death Struck it and now what's got going to do he's he's got so many of those seeds down through there that's predestinated and then at the end time he won't say Eve come and bear another child he will say and we'll call and I will answer amen and when the last one comes in that settles it amen now that's the kind of God we are serving tonight that's the kind of omnipotence that we are serving tonight so what have we got to worry about yeah there's trouble in the land yes it's it's a horrible day that we're living in it's Sodom hour it's a Noah hour it's an end time hour but what have we got to worry about Hallelujah God's got this all pre-planned before the world began and nothing going to interrupt his plan and he is planned to Rapture a way of escape and we're going to take it instead of going through the tribulation what a promise that is and one of these days the all these atoms that's holding these bodies together it's going to be broke away and we're going to go back to dust and the light's going back and the other parts of the earth going back to its place but at the resurrection he'll step right into it amen you talk about the Breath of God that's what the Breath of God is doing the Winds of the Holy Spirit the Breath of God that you feel uh that is blowing through this church will blow in such a way that the dust from the earth will rise and will form bodies and theophanies that are on the other side will come and move into them and we will Embrace and talk with them amen you talk about an appearing they will appear to us hallelujah and then that same baptism of the holy spirit will blow over us over these mortal bodies and our dust will be glorified dust that can move through walls transcend dimensions and travel like a thought hallelujah we're we're on one of the cusp of the greatest event that has ever taken place you want to say well Divine Healing is Over You Ain't Seen Nothing To what's coming gray hair is coming back the right color again amen you can't take all of those false body parts that you're getting of these joints and kneecaps and everything else and your false teeth I mean you won't need them over there Hallelujah you're going to be chained in a moment in the twinkling of an eye what a promise that is you see and brother BR said you see these little pockets going to the air they call S saucers he said well we better leave that alone here all these people come up missing do you don't hear from them they're standing there and they're not there well that's the way the Rapture is going to be one of them will drop down and this terestrial body will take on a Celestial body and there'll be hi hair of Bones left and it'll be transformed in a moment of time dropping right out of space and taking home that oh he said the pentagon's wondering about all these Mystic lights but they don't they don't know what it is but listen little children it's going to pick you up up one of these days that Pillar of Fire that we saw witnessed in a picture that Pillar of Fire that me as a boy you know would would watch the effects of it as it called out people and and their names and where they were from and everything else as I sat in the meetings of brother Brandon let me tell you one day that same Pillar of Fire is going to sweep over you amen and change your mortal body amen we are here in the very hour and the scripture is saying right here it's showing you by prophecy what would happen here at the end time oh he said well after a while the church would it can stay in that place every seed has been brought to his spot they'll be gone they won't know what happened to them one will be going this way one will go over to the pastor's house and one would be going here or down there and the first thing you know they're not there for Enoch was the T God took him and he was found not come down to investigate well what's he investigating what's he looking for when Jesus told us what he'd be looking for when the son of man cometh will I find faith and that is what the appearing of the Lord is is to turn our hearts back to believing again to restore that Faith at his appear to Abraham he as King theophany created a body for himself and for two angels to dwell in now why did he do it this way well Redemption by the blood of the Lord Jesus had not been yet done the blood had not been shed God couldn't come and dwell in sinful men for the blood of bulls and goats could not take away sin so so you know he to Abraham he came down and created bodies but now in our day he comes down in redeemed bodies cuz we're on the other side of the Cross Hallelujah so he comes down and redeem bodies and this is why for I appearing that he uses redeemed elect people to appear in like brother Bram said in the message Abraham he said he's here I can say that in the name of the Lord think he is now he can use my flesh the same as he could create some cuz he made me anyhow you could he could use your flesh he created and made you don't think don't don't you think that now if you just open up your heart and get yourself out of the way he'll come in and can use you he's the same God he gives the same signs so in this day he you can use your body he doesn't have to create him one all he has to do is redeem it by his blood and come and dwell in it so where is he appearing today amen he's appearing in his people you see the appearing is not his coming he will come in a Corporal body the Lord Jesus that's the Capstone of all of his appearing it will cresendo into the the visible physical manifestation of Jesus Christ and we will meet him in the air that's what Believers believe as brother Bram said in three kinds of Believers there is a heaven and a there's a literal Jesus Christ there that will come in a body form to receive his him his church to himself no matter how old the story seems is still the truth God said so that's what Believers believe I'm a Believer tonight so I believe in the physical return the literal body of Jesus Christ we will meet him in the air and that's what the appearing will cresendo into is his coming now I'm a thoroughbred believer and I heard someone say a preacher so about to come to the Lord I don't believe in that Pentecostal pack of Lies but I'll tell you a born again man or woman is just as sure as a coming of the Lord Jesus they're just as sure they got the Holy Ghost as there is a holy ghost to be given amen now brother bradam said this about it he said now we see his word Vindicated we believe he Vindicated his word of today what is it what do I care about what the year brings oh yeah what do I care about next year what do I care whether I live today or die today every word that he promise will be he Vindicated everyone if he's able to do it today after promising it 2,000 years ago if it's a 100,000 years on Jesus will return to the Earth in a visible body for a church a redeemed the bride and take her out of here and where regardless of what comes and goes of Fashions saying go on and people can wait on into total darkness and believe anything say they want to believe but Jesus Christ will return again for your reference that's the message Shalom now so you know there's going to be a bunch of missing people amen you see because we will be caught up together to meet the Lord and the air as he said think of it and going beyond the camp think of it missing people amen they can't see you no more but you're getting together with the rest of the group think about it when we see those in theophanies come back and take on and glorify that dust and when we see them we're going to be changed to be exactly like them and the world won't see them and the world won't see us but we'll be getting together with the rest of [Applause] them for they which are alive and remain through the coming of the Lord will not prevent those that are asleep or hinder them there's going to be somebody I love that somebody alive somebody remaining true somebody steadfast somebody that knows their God somebody that can do exploits there's going to be somebody alive and remain at the coming of the Lord a Living Church who knows a living God with a living power and the resurrected Christ missing people hallelujah he said no those those which are asleep they're not dead Christians don't die they're just taking a little rest amen that's all and the Trump of God shall sound and the dead in Christ shall rise first and appear to many and all at once you happen to stand there and look and there's a brother and you know it ain't long in a few minutes we chains in a moment twinkling of an eye together with them be missing on the Earth Caught Up to meet the Lord in the air Hallelujah now that is the Blessed hope of all True Believers and we must never and and I'm I'm I'm doing this on purpose because I want to establish this as we talk about this appearing as he did Under The Oaks at mamry but I establish that we have a blessed hope of all True Believers have that hope and we must not let Satan minimize his physical return but at the same time we must recognize his appearing and we have a church world who are given lip service to the Corporal coming of of the Lord all the while not recognizing his appearing and right now is disappearing he's appearing today in bright form amen with Revelation with signs with wonders and the five-fold gifts of ministry and helps and tongues and interpretation and prophecy and word of knowledge and miracles and faith and the same works that Jesus did amen that we do all we do also right now because we are the continuation of the book of Acts now many may not recognize him because they don't believe him to be alive and there's no expectation of a resurrected Christ and there there in the heat of the day and brother it's hot hell is moving closer all the time kind of like last summer you know we had a lot of days in Louisiana I'm pretty sure you did too you're too close to us that was you know pressing right around 100 Mark finally you know I said to Timothy I said son you're going to have to find us a place to move because hell is moved here but you know that's kind of the way we feel you know here we are sitting in the tent as it was like Sarah was hoping politics Will Change change hoping my vot to make things better but you see the bride of Christ like Abraham is there in the tent of that door the door of that tent and they're watching for the appearing of the supernatural he's passing by and I'm not going to miss him amen I'm going to be a part of his visitation amen now like the amazing mayus walk in Mark 16:12 the Bible said after his resurrection that he appeared in another form unto two of them as they walked and went into the country he appeared in another form now you've got to recognize the form that he's appearing in now and I want to say again he is here today in bridei form that's the form he's appearing in now again in God's provided way brother bradam said remember these two words for I leave you the appearing of Christ and the coming of Christ to two different things Christ is now appearing in the fullness of his power his coming will be afterwards his appearing before his coming so he says before that before that meeting in the air that we just preached about he's going to have an appearing he's going to be appearing but it will be in another form because you see 2,000 years ago he he came and he would reveal himself in the groom but in this day he is revealing himself in a bride in a people for his name's sake and so we are here in the hour of the Bride coming of Christ this is the bride age this is the age of the elect Lady this is the token age with the literal Life of Christ Is possessing a people in this day and hour and so we're here we know we're at the end of civilization it has come from the the East following the sun Westward and it's now at the west but it's turning back to the east again and the gospel is going there again today I had the privilege of of sponsoring the in the Japanese language another 10 sermons of brother brandom's you know because over there by by God's grace we've helped from our church helped establish a little group of people over there and they've named their their church the church of the Rising Sun you see the gospel is going back to the East and it's going to go to Jerusalem you know it'll go back to the Jews so it's headed on its way back but we're here still now at the evening time of the Gentile dispensation and we know the scripture said it shall be light in the evening time so brother brandom said how many knows there's a difference between the appearing of Christ and the coming of Christ it's two different words now the is the appearing the coming will soon be he's appearing in the midst of us doing the works that he did once in his church now you're a part of that church and by Grace you believe and I'm a member of that church now I want to read it just the way he said it now I'm not a preacher you know that no I'm not I have not the education to do that sometimes I feel reluctant standing here by men of God who's called to that office there our Apostles prophets teachers pastors evangelists not all our Apostles not all our prophets not all our teachers not all are evangelists but my Ministry is a different Ministry from a pastor or teacher I'm not uh and if I say things wrong Brethren forgive me I don't mean it but this is my Ministry to declare him that he is here so I want you to know the ministry in this day that come from a prophet of God was to declare that Christ is here yes he's coming and we'll meet him in the air but he's here right now amen he's here not not present in the body of Jesus as in the Corporal coming but in his appearing now there's a difference between his appearing and his coming and his appearing he's present in spirit form to impart re Revelation Faith understanding and yet something more than just theology but he's appeared to reveal mystery truths but also to reveal the mystery of Faith and Healing and miracles he's appearing to his elect lady to get her to believing you see this was the problem right there here here was Sarah the old woman the church and she was having a problem believing that she was going to receive the promised son she was full of doubt and unbelief and everything else that was a condition we were in a 2,000 year old church decrepit old cranky in dogmas man's ideas and you know had our theories and had our Hagar moments and ismeal and wild seeds and everything else that had come out of unbelief amen but God was appearing there because he had to get Sarah on board he had to get the church to believe in again and that's what God is doing in this day and hour is getting you back to Faith back to believe him now his appearing is not his coming his coming is a physical Corporal body coming to resurrect the Saints take us in Rapture meeting in the air and I'm not repetitive because I'm old I'm repetitive because you're old I'm talking to you Sarah I want you to get it amen again I want you to get it his appearing is not his coming his coming is his physical body coming to resurrect the Saints and take us in the Rapture of meeting in the air and brother Bron's Ministry declared that Christ is here in what form the Holy Ghost and he can heal any sickness even the sickness of the church because we have been sick with false doctrines and Creeds of man but I we had to have a healing we have to start believing that there's nothing too hard for the Lord you see see if we can't believe for healing Divine Healing how are we going to believe for the change of our body you see every man who God has appeared to is called to even pray for the sick these signs shall follow them that believe his ministry declared that he is here to save The vient Sinner he is not here with no mercy he is here pouring out Mercy Grace upon Grace Hallelujah brother Brandon preached us a message of Grace he preached a god rich in Mercy not a God out of Mercy not a god that is spurning people a god rich in Mercy a god who's sending a last call because he don't want any to perish to give everybody an opportunity and he's such a God that even among some of those who miss the Rapture he's going to take even in Tribulation and save them through tribulation now they'll they'll have to be saved this side we understand because that which is filthy be filthy still and holy holy still when it turns to the Jews but you know we got to get you to believe in amen we got to get you to believe in it's time for prodal to come home amen amen we got to get you to believeing Sarah we got to get you to confess in the promise you see his ministry declared he is here then Romans 10:13 for whosoever shall call upon the name of the Lord shall be saved how then shall they call on him in whom they have not believed and how shall they believe in him of whom they have not heard and how shall they hear without a preacher and how shall they preach except they be sent as it is written how beauti beautiful are the feet of them that preach the gospel of peace and bring Good Tidings of good things so the prophet's Ministry went beyond that of the five-fold ministry though he because he was a messenger the prophet Messenger to the age to bring out the mysteries of the word of God and to do this God gave brother brandham a special sign gift to demonstrate and to prove to us that the word was present now I I want you to understand the word I'm not talking about theology I'm talking about the person Christ who is the word but yet brother Brandon said I do not deny there would be prophets even as in the days of Paul when there was one agabus a prophet who prophesied of a famine I agree that is so but I deny upon the infallible evidence of the word that there is more than one major prophet messenger who will reveal the Mysteries as contained in the word and who has a Ministry to turn the hearts of the children to the father thus sayith the Lord by his unfailing word stands and shall stand and be Vindicated there is one Prophet Messenger to this age there's just not room for another amen all one men scriptures have been fulfilled you know when Jesus came he fulfilled many one man scriptures we have seen the repeat of the ministry of Christ in the day and he again fulfilled one man's scriptures but we're not living in that day and hour we are now past that we are in the point where it is now the body Ministry even as it followed in the book of Acts it changed from the one man Ministry Jesus Christ to a multim member where he was in his body now you see and to brother brandom alone was given the sign gift to dis to demonstrate that the word was now being revealed through his ministry Hebrews 4:12 for the word of God is alive and powerful and sharper than any two-edged sword piercing even to the dividing of the ther of Soul and Spirit and of the joints and the marrow and discerner of the thoughts and intents of the heart and neither is there any creature that is not manifest in his sight but all things are naked and open unto the eyes of him with whom we have to do so the word discerns going into the hidden things of the Soul you see it can go back 40 years in a person's life or it could go back and reveal things Way Beyond that all the way to the back part of God's mind and bring out Hidden Treasures in the scripture you see it would even go back to John's experience on the AIS of patmas and in this day we would we would be able to hear the same seven Thunders utter their voices and tell us what they said because now is the time for them to be revealed amen what was it declaring to us it declared to us the presence of God so we would know that God is with us and that the promised son Jesus will soon come to the church amen so in his appearing he does not come in the Flesh of Jesus he comes in My Flesh and your flesh it is his spirit and it is his anointing 1 John 2 and 27 says but the anointing which you have received of him abideth in you in Revelation 10 it shows the mighty Angel and it's an anointing it's not the Corporal coming it's not a it's not a thousand foot tall um um Christ with a foot on the land and sea it's symbolic it's representing that Christ has come down and putting his H his feet on the land and the Sea up from where two beasts have risen one out of the land one out of the sea and guess what and his feet were as pillars of fire amen where is there pillars of fire in the scripture on the day of Pentecost there's a pillar of fire but now this is pillars of Fire on the day of Pentecost what happened he opened and split himself up and 120 were filled with the spirit of God each one of them getting AB portion and here he comes and he puts his feet on the land and on the sea and what is he doing he is declaring everything is under my feet my body which is my bride amen because my feet are as pillars of fire they are men and women filled with the Holy Ghost with the power of God that has dominion over the Antichrist Spirit no matter which where he raises up out of the land or the sea whether America or the Beast system it doesn't matter our feet are on it I'm here to tell you tonight every devil is under your feet the kingdom of hell is under your feet Rome is under your feet her Creeds her dogmas the ideas of man is under your feet under the bride's feet amen is every enemy you want to know where your enemy is don't look up look down he's under your [Applause] feet an anointing comes down for the purpose of revealing Christ to this age open that up for me now in the message testimony thank you there is a portion brother random said there's a portion of word laid for every age and there is some anointing comes down that projects that portion of the word for that age now so the son of man the ministry of Christ to anoint Sons I want to get it to you not one son Sons now I know too many think this is only about the prophet messenger but that's not what he taught I I I want to I want to get it to you that's not what he taught he comes to anoint Sons it's a body Ministry now in Jehovah Gyra brother Bram says now he promised he would appear in the last day in the form of human flesh again in your flesh don't hang up on me I'm preaching to you he promised that he would appear in the last day in the form of human flesh again in your flesh like he did at the days of Sodom God which was Christ manifest In the Flesh now in his church his bride see they're coming together it's uniting time churches are uniting nations are uniting the Bride In Christ is uniting it's uniting time that was from Jehovah Gyra in the message trial he says it this way way he says Jesus Promised as it was in the days of Noah as it was in the days of lot it would be in the last days we got it it's here it's already Vindicated just how many scriptures in the Sodom age what happened to Abraham who would returned back again to Abraham's Royal seed which is in Christ Christ returning in the form of the word working in human beings and showing the signs that he promised it would do Christ returning in the form of the word now that's not a theology that's not a Doctrine but the person of the Holy Ghost a power that works in human being showing signs and wonders that he promised it would do in the message that called out brother bradam said it this way um Abraham called the name of that angel that talked to him Lord which is Elohim the Great Mighty Jehovah he was revealed in the human body he was made manifest in the body of his own son Jesus and he's made manifest in the body of every believer who will yield himself to him I'll be with you in you to the end of the world my goodness that's why he would say in the message of trial I challenge you to believe that Jesus Christ is revealed in the form of son of man in human flesh through the bride's body you see yes God used the different mask down to the ages amen but it was the same God all the time and yes we can look and see what God used brother Brandon and used him singularly as a prophet messenger and God would use that mask now the fullness wasn't in him amen because the fullness has been in the bride body ever since the day of Pentecost amen and here to be manifested in fullness in the last day sure enough are you with me amen but nevertheless God would work through that human being but now God is wanting to use your flesh on God is want to be m you said down to the age we start out the foundation from the first church age when the seed went in the ground and the complete seed and then come out through the feet Luther come back out through Wesley then the Pentecost the tongues and the lips see and now it's in the eyes prophetic Malachi 4 and so on but now there's nothing else left for it to come but for him himself to step into that sir Hallelujah cuz that's the last thing oh hallelujah amen God condescending God coming down to step into a bride in this last day a bride body I say tonight use my dust God back there in Abraham's day you had to you had to take and create and bring it together and mold a body but now Lord you redeem me and here's my dust hallu come use my dust convinced and concerned now is appearing of the Lord is now when he's appearing among his people or in his people his Spirit working among them proving that it's him with them getting them ready for the Rapture in time evangelism now is the appearing because he said appear and come is two different words to appear and then to come now is he appearing he's already appeared in these last day right here with us in these last few years now it's a sign of his coming he's appearing in his church amen in the form of the Holy Spirit showing its him now here's what he means the difference between his appearing and his coming what's what he says the appearing and the coming is two different things the appearing of the Lord is now now he's appearing among his people we see him in his same works the appearing his holy spirit but his coming will be in a physical meeting being it will be to catch the church up for us disappearing of Christ as he appears in Bride form this is it it's God changing his mask the last thing that God does before Jesus return is to reveal himself behind the mask of those people who are his bride now like in mamry God when God appeared in flesh Under The Oaks at mamry the appearing of God in the last day will also be under a tree it'll be under the bride tree and it will not be a leafless tree amen come on it won't be a leafless tree but a tree where the holy spirit is welcome where Saints run to meet him did you do do you know when he appeared he ran to meet him he was eager for his presence he was watching for his appearing we ought to be watching for his appearing in this church tonight amen because he'll move through this building he'll move in your life he'll change your life he'll heal your body he'll bring Deliverance to you we ought to be looking for his appearing of people who run to meet him who are eager who anticipate him Lord we're looking for you to come tonight come up in me come hear that message through me come do this work through me come speak through me where Saints run to meet him and bow down to worship Him but to do this we must be a restored tree can you imagine trying to to to to be be welcome him under a snag with no leaves no Fellowship come on a a tree that is naked of Life void of the spirit where the winds can't flow through it and blow the leaves and the Holy Spirit move among them and they're just dead and dry and starchy come on that's not welcoming to him amen here he had got into a place he'd come to the plains of mamory and come under the oak tree getting ready for the appearing the appearing before the coming of the promised son and that's what we got to be in this day as our oak tree that we come down and we sit down under a shade we must be a a restored tree under whose shade Jehovah comes to abide in Joel chapter 1 and verse4 he tells us what had happened to the tree he said that which the Palmer worm has left the Locust is eaten that which the Locust has left the cankerworm is eaten that which the cankerworm has left the caterpillar is eaten till it become a snag but that's not the end of the tree that is our past condition down through the barness of the church age but that's not where we are in this day I want to read to you the scripture that is being alive today and I will restore to you Joel 2:25 I will restore to you the years that the Locust has eaten the cankerworm the caterpillar the Palmer worm my great Army which I sent among you and you shall eat in plenty and be satisfied and praise the name of the Lord your God that is dealt wonders with you and my people shall never be ashamed Hallelujah so don't get on to me for praising him come on don't get on to me brother for eating and plenty and having plenty of word and plenty of Truth things to Rejoice about things to shout about things to dance about Hallelujah for he has made a promise I will restore sayth the Lord you might want to turn with me to Psalms 80 and verse 8 brother Rand and preached a sermon on this the vine out of Egypt thou H has brought a vine out of Egypt and thou has cast out the heathen and planted it thou preparest room before it and did cause it to take deep root and it filled the land you see Israel was a Vine that could never be fruitful until it was promised planted back in his Promised Land you know there there is trees that must have a certain atmosphere you can even take things from Louisiana and plant them up here and they just want Thrive baby them and everything else bring something from here and there but they will thrive in their Homeland amen and you see Israel was could never be fruitful unless they were planted back in the promised land of their inheritance until then it just produced The Naughty bitter fruit of slavery you see brother Bram tells us in Gabriel's instruction to Daniel he said God never did deal with Israel to till she came to her Homeland hear me thus sayeth the Lord God will not deal with his church till she comes back to the Homeland the message of the Hour come back to the original get away from your Methodist Baptist Presbyterian your Pentecostal Assembly Wess stress fineness whatever it is Church of of God Nazarene Pilgrim Holiness Church of Christ all Antichrist movement I realize this strikes the world all wrong all of the devil they're Godly men and every one of them godly people and every one of them movements with the organization is s is not of God and God will never bless it and he has never done it and that's why you could never be a fruitful Vine planted out there but God took you out of Egypt oh Hallelujah and he planted you in the message of the hour where you would have the atmosphere where that you can produce the fruit of the word hallelujah a people who brings forth his fruit and his season yes now it's a Baptist Creed that says when you re you that you receive the Holy Ghost when you believe the message that's a Baptist Creed as a false Doctrine it's just as it's just as wrong as the ausa Creed from Pentecostal Creed that says you receive the Holy Ghost when you shout dance or speak in tongues that's incorrect you'll never grow Christlike fruit in that soil come back to the Homeland you see ausa street is not our homeland and neither is Baptist or Methodist our homeland we are not trying I want you to get this as I go along I want to this point to be really clear we are not trying to reproduce the isua Revival nor are we trying to feed the bride of Christ Pentecostalism yet in saying that many are so identified are so afraid afaid I mean of being identified they're so afraid they'll be identified as an isua Pentecostal Branch until they have become leaning the other way till they become a Baptist branch which happens to be a several Church ages behind even a Pentecostal one amen so you see we don't want to be a Baptist Branch nor an isusa Branch but those because those with that fruit is going to be cut off and be thrown into the fire of tribulation we want to be the genuine original Branch as the church was on the day of Pentecost to receive the blessings in the fullness of God for a rapture we must be planted in the homeland of the open book and the fullness of the word that came by its opening yes sir now a lot of times you know you preach about healing and praises and worship and and and gifts of the Spirit and all us and PE people think my my goodness brother Tim what what in the world are you preaching that for cuz it's in the book and I just happen to believe if it's in the book all of it is open to me amen the mysteries of God the revelation of the seven Thunders you know the the those divinely mystery revealed truths they're all in the book word worship is in the book praise is in the book healing is in the book the holy spirit is in the book everything and I want everything that's in the Homeland Hallelujah we can be a fruitful Branch you see God never blesses Israel till she gets back to her Homeland brother Brandon said God will never bless you Methodist Baptist Pilgrim Holiness Nazarene Church of Christ Pentecostal organization never bless you this way come back to the Homeland to the beginning back to the Pentecostal experience like happened on the day of Pentecost with the power of the Living God changed those thousands of people and set their hearts of flame with the fire of God that showed genuine not impersonated sign not some makeup telepathy or not some mockery he wants us back to the truth back to the spirit back to the right life back to the highway in Christ back to truth how can he ever bless us the way we go he want he never blessed Israel until they came back to the promised land and when they got back in the Promised Land signs and wonders begin to happen Hallelujah when you get in the atmosphere of the Holy Ghost back in the Promise Land of the word what are you going to see the signs will begin to follow them that believe not only were they not blessed out of the promised land but the land lay Barren for years it was just a Barren land just a you know a few Arabs going around on it you know with their camels and so on it was a it was a Barren Wasteland and it it was said to the the Jewish people when they returned to their Homeland after World War II that all of a sudden after all of these years of baress rains began to fall that had been withheld from years until the land had become Barren but when the people of the book returned back to the land end of the book The Rains Begin to Fall amen and it begin to Blossom the desert begin to Blossom as a rose and it began to produce his fruit now why has the rain been withheld if you look with me to deuteron 11 and verse 8 therefore say you keep all the Commandments all the Commandments which I command you this day that you may be strong and go and possess the land whether you should go to possess it that you may prolong your days in the land which the Lord swear to your fathers to give them unto them and to their their seed a land which floweth with milk and honey for the land which thou goest into possess is not as a land of Egypt from which you came out where you sought so is thy seed and wat it with thy foot as a garden of herbs you see they live by the Nile there Deuteronomy 11:1 so here here again you know it's not like the land of Egypt where you you you had to work up a Revival use your foot the Bible said here use your foot they would they would use those those um those long poles out with their buckets and use their foot and spin them around and ditch them put them over in in a ditch and and you watered it with thy foot you see it was with your Works working up revivals and working up a meeting we're not here to work up a meeting but the land whether you go to possess is a land of Hills and Valleys and drinketh water of the rain of Heaven A Land which the Lord thy God carth for for the eyes of the Lord are thy God are always upon it from the beginning of the year until the end of the year and it shall come to pass if you will diligently hearken diligently unto my Commandments which I command you this day to love the Lord to your God and serve him with all your heart with all your soul that I will give you rain of your land in this due season the first rain and the latter rain that they may Gather in thy corn and their wine and thy oil and I will send grass in thy field for thy cattle that th mayest eat to be full and be full take heed of yourself that your heart not be deceived and you turn aside and serve other gods and worship them for then the Lord's wrath will be kindled against you and he will shut up to heaven that there be no rain that the land yield not her fruit lest you perish quickly from the good land which the lord giveth you so you see here's why the the land the the Reigns was withheld because they began to serve other gods and then that would take them out of their Promised Land then the land became Barren but when you come back into the land what he said I'm going to pour out the rain the former rain and the latter rain I'm going to give you the teaching rain and the Harvest rain Hallelujah and you you will gather in your corn and th oil and th and th wine you know you're going to be full you you're going to be satisfied won't be no hungry Among Us won't be no starving children as if if they're in some type of a a prison camp come on this is not a Holocaust in a Jewish prison camp we were delivered from that we were held out there and the starve to death out in those syst systems but God with spiritual Wars saw that we got out of that and got back to our homeland God releasing the Holy Spirit and here we are and what's he doing he is pouring out the former rain and the latter rain in its season so that we can be a fruitful Branch so brother Bram tells us in the 70th week of Daniel he said back to the message brother back to the original back to Pentecost back to the real blessing back to the name of Jesus Christ back to the baptism of the Holy Ghost back to signs and wonders back to Pentecost away with the organization back to the Holy Ghost so look at verse 7 Psalms 80 and verse 7 restore us God Almighty make your face to shine on us that we may be saved you transplanted a Vine from Egypt you drove out the Nations and planted it you cleared the ground fart and took the root and filled the land the mountains were covered with his shade the mighty Cedars with its branches its branches reached as far as the sea it shoots as far as the river why have you broken down its walls so all that pass by pick his grapes bores from the that's pigs bores from the forest ravage it insects from the field the canker worm the caterpillar the Palmer worm the Locust his feet on it return to us God Almighty look down from heaven and see watch over this Vine the root of your right hand right hand is power has planted the sun who you raised up for yourself through his power he raised up Christ and the root is Christ and he's the son that God raised up God planted his tree and he is determined to bring forth his family your Vine is cut down it is burned with fire at your rebuke your people perish and so like the Israel the church was cut down and H the way to mystery Babylon but that's not the end but I will restore sayith the Lord and how is he going to do it verse 17 says let your hand your power rest on the man at your right hand the son of man who you have raised up for yourself the son of man the Holy Spirit the prophet of the hour that anointed the seventh angel to prophesy and the same Holy Spirit Upon Us makes us prophesy again Hallelujah God's power would be upon the prophet and the church who by the way is a prophetical class of people hallelujah now so you see for this restoration is going to take more than a Reformation it will take a prophetic anointing the son of man Christ would manifest himself as prophetic anointing a particular anointing notice here brother bradam said it this way we're expecting that great anointing upon the church that will turn the hearts back to the original doctrine of the fathers back to the real genuine Pentecost again he says because we find in the scripture in Malachi 4 that there is to be an anointing come down and Resto again that original faith and bring the faith of the people back to the original Pentecost the faith of the fathers again he says to restore what the faith of the people back to the original fathers the Pentecostal Doctrine the original fathers and he will restore the people back to the fathers so that anointing of Christ would be called the spirit of Elijah you see that the spirit of Elijah was was we don't believe in reincarnation so it wasn't that he got Elijah's Spirit his human Spirit but the anointing that was saw upon him which was Christ Came Upon elishah then we would see it upon John then we would see it on Malachi 4 in this last day then it'll come to the Jews over in the tribulation so you see the spirit of Elijah is not The Reincarnation of a man nor his Spirit but it is the spirit of the Lord that is identified with Elijah as he turns the hearts of Israel back to the faith in Jehovah again so this Elijah would have a job of restoration like the original Elijah the Elijah in this day has to be a Ministry of restoration now in First Kings 18 and verse 30 we find The Showdown First Kings 1830 30 and Elijah said unto all the people come near to me and all the people came near to him and he repaired the altar of the Lord that was broken down notice what he does he repairs the altar of the Lord that was broken down and Elijah took 12 Stones according to the number of the tribes of the sons of Jacob upon whom the word of the Lord came saying Israel shall be thy name and with the stones he built an altar in the name of the Lord and He made a trench around of the altar as great as was contained two measures of seed so I want you to notice here first he repairs the altar he does not build a new altar he doesn't bring a new doctrine the message we have received is not something new it is not something different from the Bible amen come on it is the doctrine of the Apostles and Prophets The Message we have it is what Paul preached Even Heaven testified that when brother Brandon wouldn't be on the curtain of time he said I preached this what Paul preached and they said we know that and we're resting on that heaven rest on the fact that he preached what Paul preached now this is very important because what we have is not a new doctrine is not a new message it is a restoration now I know that makes maybe some of you question a little bit that's okay you just hang on a minute we'll get there I'm old and I'm slow but the message we have received is not not something new it is the doctrine of the Apostles and Prophets this what Paul preached listen brother brandham did not have to go and write a new Bible he didn't have to do like the Jehovah's Witness and even write an interpretation reinterpret it he didn't have to go and add an addition Book of Mormons you see you know he he actually restored what what Paul preached what we have today is the original gospel amen you brother Tim we got more than what old Paul preached no we don't this is a restoration back to the faith of the fathers we do not have a gospel different from Paul you know that would Place us under a curse do you see Galatians 1:8 the we are an angel from heaven preach any other gospel unto you than what we have preached unto you let him be a cursed so if we are preaching something different from what Paul preached we're under a curse as we have said before so say I again if any man preach any other gospel unto you than what ye have received let him be a cursed there can be no additions nor subtractions to this Bible Revelation 2218 I testify to to every man that heareth the words of this prophecy of this book If any man shall add unto these things God shall add unto him the plagues that are written in this book and if any man shall take away from the words of the book of this prophecy God shall take away his part out of the book of life and out of the holy city and from the things that are written in this book now yes granted there were symbols in the Book of Revelation and yes it wasn't understood until this day as to what those symbols were so we do understand things that Paul didn't you know when Paul preached and he said we which are alive and remain yeah he believed he was the one going to be raptured it wasn't revealed to him that would be 2,000 years of Gentile Church ages and God even Waits until uh until he is gone to break Revelation to to John and show him there's Seven Cities and there's seven stars and you know and and and there's all of these and he shows it all in symbols but it's not explained and it's your guess as good as mine until a prophet comes amen it's all written in symbols and nobody knows what it means it's kind of like in the days of Daniel it's handwritings on the wall many many tles you far come over here Baptist tell me what that mean I don't know it's a sealed well what does this mean Presbyterian well I think um you know uh Matthew Henry what do you think well this is my guess you know sus apocalypse what do you think well this is my guess everybody's probing everybody's trying to understand everybody's trying but nobody knows until the prophet comes on the scene and when the prophet comes on the scene then that which was symble becomes a known truth that's right come on thou are weighed in the balance and found wanting right so that which was in symbol become known by a prophet God had wrote it but wrote it in symbols it was speaking in tongues to everybody else that's what the Book of Revelation is to so many is still speaking in tongues it's a sealed book but it ain't sealed to you because it's given to you to know the mysteries of the Kingdom that's why God would sent a prophet in this last day to make known to you the truth so you can see your day your hour your moment of visitation so in that day Paul did not need to know God would hide it from them that there would be seven Gentile Church ages they didn't need to know that Satan would have done a lot of damage with it if they would have known it's going to be 2,000 year well there's no her to get the gospel out we got a long time we can just slop along but every generation went down looking for the coming of the Lord in their day God did that on purpose amen e even now he's he's hid from us even hid from us the very day and the and the hour and the moment he will return oh everybody comes up with well he's coming this year or he's coming that year or I tell you I know when the moon comes here and the blood moon does it I come on how many gimmicks have we seen down to time you know how many people have I had come shake their finger in my face thus sayith the Lord you know you'll see you'll see I said yeah I will see and when the day comes passes well I saw just like I thought amen God keeps that part a mystery you know why because he wants you looking for the coming of the Lord today well what if he' have told you in the year 2000 it' be 2024 sometime that he would come you'd have slopped along but look at the Glorious life that you've had as a Christian walking with him these 24 years amen so that's the way that God did it he hid it from them but you see it comes a time for us to know when he is here to do specific things it's like I explain it like this sometimes you know I was going on a trip sometime ago and and and uh you know this is the day before GPS and they uh we we were going to Florida I was going to preach a memorial service for a brother in my church his father had passed and so i' went to going to Florida and as I got in the car I said uh wait wait wait wait just a minute uh I forgot my map he said you don't need a map I know that way like the back of my hand I've been there so many times I said you don't need a map but I need a map so I'm going to get my map so we're going to wait just another minute cuz I got to have a map cuz I don't know where I'm going and I need a map to tell me so I'm driving along at about 2:00 in the morning I said hey I can I'm tired would you spell me an hour you know I I I said now there's a turn down here don't miss it oh I know you can rest rest I said Okay so about an hour later I feel the van come to a stop I get up and look around where are we I don't know the road just disappeared I said roads don't just disappear I said you know you something's wrong and he said well tell me something I tell you what look on that map and tell me where we are I said it don't work that way I said this map is useless to me cuz I don't know where I'm at unless I know where I'm at on this map I can't tell you so you got lost buddy so you see that that store over there walk in that store and I want you to ask him this question where am I and when you find out where you are I'll look here on the map and I will find it and I can find out how to get from here you see that was where we were we didn't know what church AG we were in we didn't know there were church ches we didn't know even how to read the map but God sent a prophet in this day and put his finger on the map and said here you are in the Leo C this is the hour of his appearing that is Among Us now so now we can take the road map and go toward the future home home and the Rapture every promise of God can't we amen why because God sent a prophet in this day and hour amen who could tell us where we were in the book so now you see there were symbols but they wouldn't understood until this day what the symbols were like the mystery of the Seven Stars the meaning of the Seven Cities the seven golden candlesticks Paul didn't know there would be seven Church ages he fully expected the Lord to come in his age saying we which are alive and remain there's a mystery of the seven Thunders which are the Mysteries contained in the Seven Seals when they were opened and it revealed the symbols of each seal but this did not give us new doctrines we did not receive a different gospel this unsealed the book and restored back to us the land the Paul amen William brandham he brother brandham taught water baptism as Paul taught it the Holy Ghost is an experience like Paul believed it amen Paul come to Ephesus found believers who who had believed and asked if they had experienced the Holy Ghost since they believe he he ex insisted you must have an experience after beli amen Paul said that men would be judged by his gospel he said there his gospel was a revelation of the mystery that had been hid from the foundation of the world and were revealed by his gospel you find this in Romans 16 Romans 15 and 19 through many signs and wonders through Mighty signs and wonders by the power of the spirit so from Jerusalem and round about the Lum I have fully preached the gospel of Christ and here we come in the last day and the gospel must now go into all the world because it must be finished notice the gospel must be preached into all the world then the end can come using every means possible lot of people criticize the internet and criticize our use of it and whatever we got to do it by every means possible amen we have we the Bible said in Matthew 24 verse4 the gospel of the Kingdom shall be preached un all the world for a witness unto all nations and then shall the End come do you know brother brandom told us an invisible Union of the Bride he said denominations cannot fulfill the Great Commission he said they cannot receive the open and of the Seven Seals and because of that he said they can't receive the whole word so that how could they fulfill the Great Commission do you realize then it lays on our shoulders to fulfill the Great Commission go into all the world and preach the gospel and these signs shall follow them that believe they will lay hands on the sick and they shall recover come on we have the gospel now there's a gospel preached according to the Baptist according to Methodist according to Pentecost but the gospel of the kingdom whose Mysteries Paul revealed must be preached in all the world for a witness and then shall the End come and we must use every means we have to do it and the only ones that can do it are those with an open book it's no longer sealed well all of them are open but one well then your book is still sealed that's right come on you don't want you you cannot know his Mysteries you see you see but I go back at Elijah Elijah did not add new Stones he laid the original Stones back in in their place amen so you see like here's some Snippets of what Elijah is going to do that's little excerpts what I just took from the message it's going to go back to its original again back to the real Holy Ghost back to the gospel message back to Acts 2 back to the formul back to where it began at it'll have the same Doctrine the same power show the same signs because it's the same kind of church they had at the beginning Elijah will go back to the original Pentecostal Ephesus Church and bring that same message to the people with the signs of the Messiah he will send and that Elijah will shake the people right straight back to the original Pentecostal Doctrine it'll be a restoration to send that lukewarm leodan church back to that original Faith again yes sir and she he will be anointed to do so second seal he will restore and bring back the children to the faith of the Father the original Apostolic Pentecostal Faith which he promised to be restored third seal the the Bible said that this messenger this last day would restore back to the original Faith again back to the faith of the fathers over and over and over brother brandham tells us he said it'll be we're promised Malachi 4 by the same system he always did that's a prophet that we would be restored back to the original Faith oh my back to the original seed back to the seed like it began on the day of Pentecost back to the same Doctrine word by word power by power Spirit by the same thing just exactly it was at the beginning through signs and wonders of the living presence of Jesus Christ you see it's over and over there are hundreds hundreds of times brother Bram tells you what Malachi for was to do to turn our hearts back to the original amen back to real genuine Pentecost not ausa Street don't get confused amen back to the original back to what Paul preached the same gospel the same power the same original Pentecostal message word by word he said look brother back to Pentecost let's get back to the original get back to the beginning get back to where we left it hear me I speak in the name of the Lord back to the beginning how could he speak in the name of the Lord and that not be where he took us come on that's well the world's falling apart amen mic number two Hallelujah all right coming right down to it this is the day of restoration church look where we're at at this time look look at the hour we're in look what God is promising to do in this last day you know there some things that brother brandham wanted to impart to us before he left and I've told this many times but I read a book called Killing Lincoln by O'Reilly and it would you know in there he told about you know Lincoln on this certain day he went this certain place and the man who had so many days to live did this and that and this man went had so many days went to Gettysburg and on and on you know and finally comes down to his death and so he he traces out all the last days of Lincoln and I thought about that and I said you know God you spoke in this generation to the leoan age and you sent the leoan messenger and it was the message of Jesus Christ to the last age and you were imparting some things and some of there there's some of the last things that would be imparted to us as the bride body and I I just want to get this for a moment in in August just before he will go in November he preaches the God of this evil age the man who had only a few more sermons to preach the the message that only only where Jesus Christ would be speaking through a messenger to the last AG the last words here now is being imparted and he says when Eve had the very feeling of God's word in her hand she could have took God's word but what did she do instead of tearing for the baptism of the Holy Ghost let science prove to her that the Holy Ghost was only for the disciples instead of keeping Divine Healing going when she op to be now raising the dead and doing great Miracles she has let Satan under his leadership of religious men take the word of God and try to say it was for another age and she believed it when Jesus said the things that I do shall you do also Jesus said that go into all the world and preach the gospel to every creature and we're still creatures these signs have follow every one of them that believe and she denies everybody she's denies all the Supernatural and swapped it for an intellectual conception of the Bible think of that here God trying to impart what we ought to be doing are you with me amen for why he is to appear in pred body amen there has to be a change start taking place where Sarah realizes I'm pregnant and A change is taking place and the change doesn't start out here it starts on the inside From the Inside Out hallelujah oh my brother Ram said again in things that are to be what we should expect things that are to be what is going to be and I believe the same thing we live today God bearing record of his word by vindicating what he said he would do and we know this is the day of salvation where God is calling men from the world from a life of sin to a life of service and in the day that God has poured out his Spirit from on high great signs and wonders are to accompany the ministry of this day this is when the former and latter rain are falling together and we know there's supposed to be great signs and wonders which in many denomination this is turned down let's not be those that turn it down amen I we ought to say God Send the Rain send the holy spirit amen saturated you see because the bride must bear forth the fruit of the word you know what's going to happen if he's appears in this day and the bride tree has no fruit what did he do to the vict tree when he passed it by and there was no fruit in it he cursed it and anything that does not have fruit in this day and hour will be cursed and go into the tribulation for the purging so here we are even down to the last recorded sermon of brother brandom you know the hour will soon arise when right Among Us the holy spirit will speak out like it did in ananas sa fire remember the hour is arriving now you just remember that God is going to dwell among his people that's what he wants to do now so all this way from the beginning to the end he would declare you know this it's like Elijah he put the wood in order the wood of the word has been correctly placed it's cut the bulock in place in in pieces and set it in order the sacrifice the atonement his work as intercessor properly placed come on don't try to move the lamb off the mercy Mercy Mercy no we still need Mercy Hallelujah I'm glad to know there's Mercy tonight but that's because there is a sacrifice on the altar that Elijah repaired he put the he put the intercessor back in place again not a man interceding between you and God but God himself Christ the intercessor amen who you can approach to the high priest that can be touched by the feeling of your infirmities blessed be the name of the Lord amen laid on the wood and said go ahead let's let's fix it where there's no impersonations pour four barrels of water and pour it on the burnt sacrifice in the wood do it second time do it a third time do it a fourth time there was a barrel of water for every tribe of Israel there's enough Holy Spirit for every Church Age come on church amen the water ran the about the Altar and he filled the trench and it came to pass at the offering of the evening sacrifice that Elijah the prophet came near and said Lord God of Abraham Isaac and Israel let it be known that thou art God in Israel and that I am thy servant and that I've done all this according to Thy word I've done it by Vision that same angel that discerned the heart that restored Health to the sick that restored hearing to the deaf well right here in Little Rock Arkansas brother Bram goes to the school of the death I was by there here a while back and went by the the the school of of the deaf and 152 deaf and dumb people receive their hearing hallelujah amen you see restored the sight to the blind the same Angel Hallelujah the same Angel showed him where to find the neglected stones of baptism in Jesus name the true Oneness of God the original sin pred destination the security of the believer and all these Mr truths and put them in the order and he said hear me oh God hear me that this people might know that thou art the Lord God and that thou has turned their hearts back again and then the fire of God fell I tell you what church that's what we need for every person the fire to fall upon them consume your sacrifice consume your own life lick up the water that's in the trench amen and when the people saw this they fell on their faces said the Lord he is God the Lord he is the God Amen this is why Malachi 4 says when the spirit that was upon Elijah comes in the last day it'll turn the hearts of the children back to the faith of the fathers so that's what's promised but we cannot welcome him under an old snag come on that's we we can't do that there's enough heat for crying out loud amen they you know the Heat's turned up in the world it's a hot day The Winds of hell are blowing and we need somewhere where that he can come among his people under a bride tree are you with me so he restores the leaves of Fellowship he restores the joy of the spirit amen where the where the trees clap their hands as the holy spirit moves through them instead of grown in the wind they are clapping their hands and swaying back and forth and say hallelujah to the Lord Of Glory Hallelujah where there's bark on the tree where there's real Doctrine not some false rag of manmade idea that hold back the gospel from you but where the power of the Holy Spirit can flow from the root all the way to the top of the tree amen it's the hour where fruit must be on the tree it must the hour where Faith must be on the tree it's the hour of the Bride tree and full restoration we are in the hour of restoration and here we are as if we were as in Abraham's day under the Trees of mammory welcomeing the coming of the son of man welcomeing God to come in flesh and we ought to say tonight here's my flesh Lord here's my body Lord here's my hands here's my vessel here I am use me God step into this flesh Hallelujah because that's where he's being revealed is in the bride's body Hallelujah let him be revealed in you Christ in you the hope of glory let's stand our feet and worship God ah Hallelujah blessed be the name of the Lord amen can your leaves clap their hands tonight amen can there be a joy and a rejoicing can the Holy Spirit move through amen can it just go and wave after wave after wave of Glory yes the musicians can come God bless you amen here we are in this last day I will restore s the Lord I'm going to bring you back to the land of the Bible I'm going to put you in a fruitful land and I'm going to pour my spirit out on you there going to be rain teaching rain and lad rain Harvest rain to bring on the fruit this is the day and the hour that we're living in want you ask him Lord don't let me just be a grafted Vine in that's bearing something different from the root let let me be of that original tree not something stuck in but a restoration for he said I we restore sayeth the Lord I want you to Bow your heads with me just for a moment you know Leo the seal will be cut off because they reject the Pentecostal message no I'm not talking about isusa street I'm talking about the gospel Paul preached [Music] brother Brandon would talk about Israel being cut off and the Wild Olive Branch the Gentiles being grafted in he said he did it because they blasphemed the Holy Ghost when they made fun and called it new wine mocked it on the day of Pentecost and because of that God cut them off and he grafted in the Gentiles and he said it'll be that the Gentile age will CLA out the same way because they reject Pentecost oh you got to have that Pentecostal experience you've got to have it where a portion of God comes into your life that portion of that Pillar of Fire where he comes and moves in you and lives in you burns out the world and burns out the dross makes you new creature in Christ Jesus Takes the world off of you what about you maybe you you've been weary longed way and on your branch there is no

for fruit he can't meet under a snag but he wants people to come like Abraham did run to meet him and wash his feet make him welcome and he'd be the welcome Christ oh that there would be a church that would welcome him a people who would invite him in oh God will you do it Lord why don't you invite him to yourself your Pew tonight and say Lord here I am what's that song Here's my hands I lift it up
