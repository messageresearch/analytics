thankful that we serve us say Brother David I mean how does he do it I don't know I just tell you we serve a supernatural God a God that changes things amen amen if uh tonight uh if the musicians want we'll get right into the we'll get right into the service and we'll keep you standing we're going to read a scripture at first while you're we w't have to get you sitting getting up and getting down um let's turn to um let's turn to Galatians the sixth chapter I'm sorry Galatians the 3 chapter this will be Galatians 3 and 26 and the Bible says for ye are all the children of God by faith in Christ Jesus for as many of you as have been baptized into Christ have put on Christ is that not a good scripture amen you put on Christ there is neither Jew nor Greek there is neither Bond nor free there is neither male nor female for ye are all one in Christ Jesus and if you be Christ then ye Abraham's seed and heirs according to the promise now let's go to the fourth chapter and uh I believe it's four and six I believe it is and because ye are Sons God hath sent forth his Spirit of his son into your hearts crying Abba Father wherefore Thou Art no more a servant but a son and if a son then an heir of God through Christ amen tonight I don't know if they took prayer request but someone handed me a prayer request didn't have a way to get it up here and we're going to go to the Lord in prayer with uh before we let you be seated and uh those request turned in to please pray for brother Jared hm's family they're sick and so as we go go to the Lord let's just keep them on our hearts kind precious Heavenly Father Lord we love you tonight and we thank you Lord we serve such a mighty God lord and you're so mindful your children and God I believe tonight that they come out on a Wednesday night Lord and I pray God that you'd help us to speak something to encourage them and God I just I believe that your word always encourages the Bible talked about where it was read or heard whether it would be an encouragement to the people Lord but I pray God that you're let the spirit of God be come down and begin to Quicken it Lord to their hearts and if there be one that down tonight Lord not know which way to turn Lord whatever they have need of I know that you're a God that knows and you could speak to them and Lord at brother Jared and his family tonight you look and see where they're at we believe that you're a God that still answers prayer and Lord I pray you'd be with them in Jesus precious name we ask ask it amen you can be seated if you'd like amen just a I don't mean this to say that I'm taking it lightly but just a Wednesday night kind of a Wednesday night lesson that maybe would ask the Lord to bless his word and help us to speak something and be an encouragement and y'all forgive me tugging at this I don't know if I've told y'all before I know I told about Brother Davis I thought they had quit public hangings but W with this tie on I think they're still doing it so amen the Lord's good and IID meant to say something the other day I know it been quite a while back my my sister um my oldest sister Deborah some of you may remember that uh she'd went through a lot of problems and I had prayed turned in a request and we had prayed for her here and she'd had a lot of problems with her foot and and uh the uh infection and stuff had got in the bone and and uh now she's had a time with it but she went to the doctor the other day and the doctor told her he said there's good news he said there is no infection in the bone so man praise the Lord for that man we God's so good to us but I begin to uh I begin to think the past few weeks I preached on this years ago and preached on this some and it's always been an encouragement to me that you know I I want to encourage God's children because not that it makes us bad people brother Joel but sometimes as humans we begin to forget who we are man we we begin to forget what we have at our disposal man we we begin to forget that we serve a God that you know we let the cares of Life start coming in on us and pressures and you get under pressure and Satan he wants to just keep laying the pressure to you and and we begin to forget that that David said that forget not God and all his benefits amen I'm telling you there's benefit in serving God Amen he's got lots of benefits man the other night I I know there was many and there's more but I just it stuck out to me I hope you don't care for me saying some sister sh kind but she come up here I'm telling you we got benefits and serving God Amen I believe I believe I serve a God that can deliver amen and when I prayed I prayed that way I prayed that God deliver amen we're not serving some dead God somewhere off in a corner that's been shoved over all the world put him that way but we serve a real God that that can that can solve real problems amen man I seen a sign one time and probably many of you might have seen it on a church and I always just like to you're such a good crowd to speak to and and y'all just let me speak my heart all and I appreciate that and that's what I'm going to do tonight just just ask the Lord to to help me and to encourage and to just say something that would cause you to to maybe draw closer to him and man that'd be our aim and but I saw a sign on a church one time and it said if God is your co-pilot swap seeds amen man I'm going to tell you there' be some troubled waters in our life and I don't want God being my co-pilot but he needs to be the pilot amen he knows the direction that you need to go amen and you know people get things uh uh I'm I'm going to get to this but this this kind of on my heart people get things where you know they they don't know which way to turn don't know which way to go but God is still a God that he has got direction for you and and brother BR made a statement one time he said that clear signs was no sign of God's approval as of Cloudy signs was no sign of his disapproval so you look and see sometime you know the old Pentecostal idea was somebody was having problems and I wonder what they done wrong amen and and you know there was a man one time that we all look to over that his name was job and he hadn't done anything brother job but yet he went through a great trial cuz God knew that he would stand the test amen so we know that we serve a God that's Mindful and tonight I hadn't even took a thought but I kind of wanted to to preach to you just a few thing few minutes on an heir of all things amen and and this is that's why I want to lay the part in there we begin to forget that who we are and and we're you know I'm I'm proud that I'm I'm a son of Connie and Howard mcgar amen I love my parents and I I'm proud to be their son but you know what I'm even prouder that I'm a son of of of of God Almighty amen amen I'm I'm thankful that he chose me to be a son amen we ought to live and walk God helped me to always live and walk and and and remember that I'm a Son of God and man we ought to see want to see people saved and amen as we was up here the other night I wanted to tell this I was telling brother Joe in the back and there was so many people coming up for prayer for different things and and I was telling brother Mark too that my neck I don't have much neck problems but my neck had been bothering me real bad and and um I uh there was so many people coming up for prayer that I just didn't find a place to jump in and get prayed for and I thought well God you'll take care of it man because I want to make sure all his children was taken care of and pray for him and I told brother Joe I said I got home and I just decided to turn my head and I pushed my head around and my neck popped and it went back in and amen I just believe I've never had my neck I don't even think pop like that before by pushing on it myself but my neck went back in place and I think him he's so good and mindful and i' I've had him take care of little things that you know might not even be important to nobody else but God knows what you God knows what you are when you're at home and ain't nobody else around he knows he knows the feelings that you have and he knows your ups and your Downs he knows your ins and your outs man for some reason I can't get started on my sermon brother Joe but it kind of has to do with anyway and I hope sister Tammy don't care for me telling this but she told me this years ago I don't even know if she remembers telling me I won't go into detail but she said that she had got real down and and nobody the reason why I don't care to tell that on her is cuz I'll put myself in there too I've got down for I don't think any of us brother Joe can point a finger at somebody else say well they was down but she said she'd got real down over something and she was laying in bed and she even want to get out of bed that morning and if I tell this wrong sister Tammy you correct me later but I'll get it close the real meaning of the end of it she said she was laying there and she reached over and got a hold of the Bible and opened it up and she thought I don't even want to get up and I'm feeling sad and down and out she said she opened it up the first scripture she started reading was a rise and shine for th light has come and the glory of the Lord is upon you she said you know what she said I felt like the Lord was telling me to get out of bed amen he knows what you have need of [Applause] Amen oh I love him tonight I'm thankful brother Joe when he could have cast me out and maybe a lot of people would have and and so I'll tell you what he just to renegate anyway won't have nothing to do with him but go I'm glad that Jesus Christ never give up on me amen I didn't deserve him to start out with I didn't deserve him when I made the first mistake I didn't deserve him when I made the third mistake but guess what he still forgive me of it amen I thankful we serve a god they say we serve a god a second chances I say that we serve a God sometimes a third fourth and fifth and sixth chances amen W let's see if I can get to this cuz I don't have all night so amen I always say I'm not long winding the older I get the harder it is to to bring it down to little bit but hey man we're going to speak when we get done if we have to we'll we'll preach on the rest of it later but and I won't charge you nothing for that first part man that just be all free but there's good news because the second part's free too I'm not going to charge you for it amen so we find out that in the script that in in Genesis that Abraham we all look to him you know as Father Abraham been looked at for years and we look back to him and the father of faith and but you know Abraham we I I kind of wonder sometimes and and if if maybe we look as a human we look at people in the Bible as superheroes and think well they did it because Abraham was a superhero well Abraham wasn't he was a man like me and you in fact he many of you probably know this I know a lot of you are Bible uh studies and and listen to tapes and and but Abraham was just he was carry packing an idol around he was he'd come up out of the uh land of CHA I believe the city of ER I believe brother B said and the Bible says and and he he he come up packing an idol he was nothing but God called him and you know what I like is is when God sat down with him and told him you know uh what he was going to do and Abraham he found God faithful and believed God like many of you have done amen you found God faithful and you come out and believed what God Said Amen that's the reason why God's blessed you amen we might not have a lot of money sometimes we might not be able to pay off our bills all the time but I'm telling you you're blessed people tonight amen if you believe this message you believe Jesus Christ you are a blessed people tonight you said brother I don't know if I'll be able to pay my electric bill next week well I take I serve a God that can help you pay that too but we're still blessed so anyway Abraham God had come to him after he had separated himself many of you know and I won't take a lot of time with it but he had separated himself from lot and lot went down into Sodom excuse me Lord had went down into Sodom and I tell you what he was down there and he got around the sin but I'll tell you sin will take you further than you want to go amen but Abraham went out he gave lot the choice Direction he went out and got out into a drought position or drought situation man didn't look like much my probably little old bony arms and and and a beard and and his hair was getting M I think bald brother BR said man he didn't look like much but God come to him and he told him he said Abraham he said now that you've obeyed me he said I want you to look to the north and look to the South and you look to the East and you look to the West because you own every bit of it I give it to you I'm making you an air to everything that I promised amen walk through the land what go go hither and to and walk through all of it walk through the breath of it cuz I give it all to you brother Travis amen may I interject this right here that tonight you say well brother D I don't have no land amen look to Genesis maybe look over in Malachi Matthew over to Revelations I give it all to you you're air to every bit of it tonight so Abraham owned it all and I thought that was something how that he said Palestine belonged to him and amen you got different ones fighting over it and this one's fighting over it and they're wanting this land and and there's turmoil all over but I'm I'm getting ahead of myself but while I've got it on my mind I wanted to put this in there that it may not look like that that the God's people's much but I told brother Mark W go where God is the minority Bec comes the majority so it may not look much like people to to people you know you sisters that wear your hair long and and you wear dresses and people look at you kind of funny and well what what's all that about I mean why do you do that what do you what do you got I mean what the but I'm telling you you own it all tonight if you've received the baptism of the Holy Ghost it don't matter you say well brother how do you know I'm going to because don't the bible say that the meek shall inherit the earth amen so you own it all anyway so let them fight and fuss over it because one of these days you're going to walk out brother Joe you're going to walk out an air in the Millennium to this thing amen just as sure as I'm standing on this platform right here you're going to walk out one day it'll be a reality brother Joe amen I don't mean to scream and holler at you but it's a truth anyway am man amen y y'all my a man Corner up here right now I appreciate it amen but you're a to it all so Abraham he was air to all of it and one day these Kings had come up I can't remember the land they'd come out of but it don't matter but these Kings had come up and had this great army with them and they come in and they come into Sodom and they took lot and all his family and took him out took them away and somebody come to Abraham and said Abraham somebody Abra you know lot was Abraham's nephew and said you know he said uh they come in and these Kings have and they've taken over these cities and maybe had a couple thousand trained men or so and and and they took lot and they they'll take them all his family and everything they'll all be slaves and and they'll they'll you know like Satan wanted to do to you he want to make you a slave but Abraham with the spirit of Christ on him brother Joe he even though lot had backslid and done wrong Abraham W he said you know what that's part of my inheritance and I'm going after it this is the part I'm telling you that I don't believe that Abraham sister Corine I don't believe that he knew one I ow to how he was fixing to go take that back if you would have wanted him to explain it he couldn't explained it no more than anything he had a few servants one place I think the Bible says I may be right brother Jonah it like 318 servants they were servants you know what they did they didn't go out and practice War they were sheep herders they took care of the cattle and everything that Abraham had they were servants carried the water but you know what Abraham took God at his word again and he said you know what lot is a part of my inheritance I own all of palestine's all of mine as far as I can see and these Kings come up and took it but I'm going to go take him back so you know what he did he wasn't a man of war he went and he had to dig up some old rusty knife somewhere that maybe hadn't been took out in a while and he tried to arm himself and maybe his servants had some more Rusty knives and and uh maybe some pics and shovels and stuff they weren't trained Men of War go Abraham wasn't looking at the pics and shovels he was looking at the promise of God do you care just for a minute if I maybe do like a 2024 version of maybe how it went Abraham in the tent I can see him and I tell you what that enemy's come in and he's took my part of my inheritance I'm going after it Sarah where is my knife at I can't find nothing in this tent no more did you hide my knife somewhere he dug out some old rusty knife amen he wasn't looking at that knife he he was looking at the promise I tell I'll go down there I'll slay every one of them Kings I'll do whatever it takes to bring my brother back you know what he did he armed himself he armed his servants and he went down there and slaughtered those kings and brought lot back amen like I said you you'll never make me believe that he knew he took God at his word it took God at his promise just like me and you have to do amen so tonight you're not an heir because you're worthy of it it wouldn't matter if my dad would have made me an heir if I would have been the biggest drunk in Arkansas it wouldn't have made no difference I still an air it didn't matter what you used to be God made you an air amen so get that out of your mind that you got to be worthy because none of us was worthy and I love this I love this meaning of this of this one on an air and remember a child I know this new age Bunch maybe not do it but in the Bible a child always falls air to what his daddy has and an heir is a person who inherits or has a right to inheritance in the property of another following the latter's death does that not sound like us amen there was one D you know they said one time that uh I always always enjoyed this story I always like this story for the sake of this message that one time there was this woman and she was over in Russia and she wasn't supposed to be out going to church and they' outlawed it and she's walking down the street one night and she's headed to church this Russian soldier he comes walking out there and he's seen her he said hey said where you headed she said oh she said I had a a brother die and I'm going to the reading of the wheel amen she got down there to church I'm telling you the presence of the Lord began to move it didn't matter that it wasn't supposed to be there brother Joe she began to raise her hands she began to Worship the Lord they sang a little bit she cried a little bit she even shouted a little bit amen she got done with church that night and Ma they had a good service listen she started back home and that same Soldier saw her walking down through there brother the phield he walked over and he said say said how'd you come out with that she said I found out he left me everything amen when he give you the Holy Ghost sister he made you air to it all brother Tom amen whatever you have you just reached down into your inheritance to get a little bit of it amen you say boy I got a little I got a little problem I need a little Joy tonight guess what sister s he placed joy in your heart you're just letting the devil rob you from it sometimes I've done it too brother if you ain't careful you let the devil rob you of what's rightfully yours you know what if someone left me a million dollars I wouldn't let you there ain't enough men big enough to keep me from going down there and picking it up you know why because I'm air to it but yet sometimes we'll let Satan begin to push us around a little bit and tell us you know what you got no right to it well I ain't got a right to it but God made me in there anyway amen praise the Lord amen it ain't what I done it what he done anyway so you need something just reach down and get it you know brother Joe my dad wasn't a man a lot of money my mom wouldn't either but I can tell you what it is to be an air naturally my dad was sick brother Joe and this sounds silly but he told he said I'm kind of like my dad I like to get out and Tinker with stuff and he told me he said brother he said David he said I want you to have my tools and stuff well he ain't got he a have nothing fancy and he has some stuff I go out there and get once in a while brother Joan and I work on something it reminds me of my dad and I'm like my dad left me this you know and that's you know that's personal to me if you seen the tools you'd be like Dave I ain't much you know and it ain't but my daddy my heavenly father he left me everything amen he left me where I could have joy he left me where I can have peace he left me a family he left me a church family amen I can have fellowship with some of my natural my mom and dad was Believers but some of my natural family they kind of look at you kind of strange what are y'all doing following a man what are you doing doing this but God give me a church family to where they don't think I'm crazy well they think I'm crazy but they don't think I'm crazy leaving this message amen that's the truth so God gives you God give give you what you have need of you say brother Dave I got a wayward son or daughter you know what just reach down there get a little dip of your inheritance out when God when Jesus Christ died on the cross he you know what he did he give you an unlimited amount of checks did you know tonight if my d dad was Bill Gates and he had all them billions of dollars do you think I'd be scared to stop down here after I start to go home and fill my tank up and write a check if I had that kind of money I'd just invite the church down I'd fill all your tanks up man just ride a check for all of it I'm going to tell you right now cuz my Daddy's got billions and I don't care I just ride out a check and I'll buy it it ain't like I was when I was a kid when I was a little boy I remember telling my mom and dad I want that and son we ain't got the money would just write a check I didn't know there had to be something in there to cover it but I want you to know that Jesus Christ signed the bottom of the check when he died at Calvary he defeated it all and he signed the check at the bottom all you need to do tonight is just fill it in what's in the memo maybe put what is it healing out the check it's already been signed tonight it's been paid for us right brother Joe amen I ain't got to worry about whether the check's going to bounce or not we serve an inexhaustible Fountain tonight we just don't want to forget start getting Amnesia and forget who we are man because a like I said a sun falls air to what his daddy has my daddy in the natural the Bible says if an Earthly father could give good gifts how much more could your heavenly father give good gifts amen my dad want the best for me your dad wants the best for you you oh your dad wants the best for you Salem your dad wants the best for you amen your heavenly father wants the best for you too but sometimes like I said it don't make us bad people we just forget I want to remind you who you are tonight and man sometimes it's good you know my dad said that he was around a guy that uh he used to go to church with and he testified one time he said Satan started pushing him around and and he started telling him that he was lost and started telling just getting him nervous and upset you know Satan loves to get you all upset and get your nerves all worked up and then he can kind of work on your feelings cuz remember Satan is a spirit too so if he can get if he can start getting you scared and worked up then you start trying to put anxiety and different things on you what we brother Joe I thought that was so good the other night how the wasn't that good the Holy Spirit how it just come in and just it was so good man I love him so much tonight but but he begins to work on your nerves and he began to tell him that he was lost and he said one day he said I got sick and tired of hearing what Satan had to say he said I squared my shoulders back and he said Satan I may be lost I don't know but he said I'll tell you this much as long as I'm here I'm going to serve him anyway if he cast me off into hell I'll serve him he said the he said I'm telling you the spirit of God broke that thing he said I didn't have no more problems with it amen sometimes you just got to be bold you know you don't wait till you feel better start confessing that you're healed or whatever you have now amen no matter how you feel cuz we're air to it tonight and man you know shamgar one time we all talk about wouldn't even know knows about shamgar shamgar he got sick and tired of it too I tell you what I love I I I love to hear about Shamar I love to talk about him because you know what did you know brother BR said you you say you might say well brother Dave you're talking about all these people that you know I'm just a lay member well I'll talk about a lay member tonight cuz shamgar wasn't a prophet he wasn't anything extra he was just he was just a lay member but you know what he was he was circumcised amen he had a promise of God Amen so shamgar he's down there and he looks over and his wife was all skinny and and her dress was all tattered and they didn't have any money to buy anything and his kids was about half starved and because just as he'd get his crops in every year eron come to the Philistines and take what he had just about like just about the time you get a little extra $100 in the bank and Satan he sees it and just about the time you think you're going to get ahead and then your car breaks down you know Thursday after that service after all that you know what first thing about happened that day somebody backed into the side of my truck just seemed like everything went wrong but you know what brother Joel and I ain't saying it cuz I'm here tonight I'm saying it cuz I said it up there I said you know what if that Satan upset at me because we was down and we was enjoying the things of God in the presence of the Holy Ghost That Old truck's going to burn anyway one of these days but what you do for Christ will last forever I'm an heir tonight amen you're an heir tonight to claim your loved ones amen you got a loved one you got to love on that's Wayward don't try to start reasoning it out just do what he said just claim them just say Lord that's part of my inheritance and I claim them tonight man because you know you well I I even I even uh I'm an heir of death I don't death don't hold no no uh nothing over a Believer amen you even control death when you death just takes you into the presence of God so there there ain't there's nothing that there's everything the Bible says all things are under his feet now I'm not real smart but all things means all things sometimes I just need to stop and think and I have to say you know what tired of Satan pushing me around man old shamgar he looked around he didn't have too much to fight with would have been nice for he could to turn around and said oh man look at that AR-15 sitting there woo man that thing's got 30 round mags and that other one's got a 60 round drum mag and I tell you I can fight this thing I'll wait until they invent that and then I'll fight no shamgar looked around and see what he had he said you know what I'm sick and tired of that just like the devil coming in and robbing me I'm sick and tired of it my wife may not be able to last my children may not be able to last another winner he reached over grabbed an ox goat a stick with a brass knob on the end of it he jumped out the window and went out there and beat down 600 Philistines you know why because he be to think I'm circumcised I'm in the promise tonight just like you are you're in the promise tonight sister Joyce amen what you have need of you're air to it like I said not that we deserve it but because Christ made us in air he said he promised Abraham he said thy seed not as many but as one Christ Jesus and us being dead in Christ makes us hes not just HS but your join HS tonight with him raised in his power man God help us tonight to to see where we are you know years ago I heard a brother I'll tell who he is because I don't know if many of y'all know him but if you do oh brother Mike Patterson used to come back and I always thought a lot of brother Mike he's such a just always had something good just a a good spirit about him and and uh just just a good man and always loved to hear him preach and he was telling something years ago and he said you know he said there was a man in my church and he said he got in a bind and didn't know what he was going to do and he said I I prayed about it and he Saidi had the money to help him I believe he said but he said I just I felt checked about it so he said we was told him he said well brother he said we'll be praying and so he said that it rocked on there and I think one night his wife was saying something about it honey I don't know what we're going to do and he said you know I don't either honey but he said you know what he said the Bible says that my my father owns a cattle on a thousand hills he said you know what he needs said tonight said maybe my father just needs to go sell a few cattle and then I'll have the money to do what we need to do he said that night they were sitting there and there was a knock on the door brother Joe and he went to the door he said A man was standing there and he said hey he said I live down the road here he said the Lord spoke to me and he said I felt led to go sell a few of my cattle and he said I want to bring you some of the money he amen sometimes you just you can't figure God out amen so he just he made the statement God needs sell a few of his cattle and he did brought him the money amen God like he makes a way when there don't seem like there's no way amen but you know if tonight if if someone left me a if someone left me a house or something you know and said you know someone come and said hey the lawyers want to talk to you that so and so left you a house and you know what brother Joe I'd want to go I'd want to go up in in that house and I'd kind of want to look around brother Mark and I'd want to see what I inherited I would wouldn't be nothing wrong with that I'd want to look over and you know after I heard it somebody was telling Dad one time I don't want to sound greedy but he said they went and they inherited some property from their family I don't know if it's their dad or who and uncle or something said he went over and they looked through the house and they got everything and they went in and clean course it was he was living there and everything was there and he went through and they checked everything they threw stuff away come to find out later he had hid some money in a cereal box and they threw it away I might check in the cereal box you leave me a house I might come over and go man they didn't seem like they had nothing but let's look in the cereal box there might be some cash in there amen it sounds funny but it's a truth so you get down now just we look over here and I don't mean to make the word of God sound like a Serial box because it's not but look in here and find out what you own amen M maybe in that house there might be some shelves up there that you can't see sister Lori might be above you know I'm pretty tall and I can see a lot but there's places in houses I I can't see so you know what I might do I get me a ladder or something and pull over everybody maybe the a kitchen chair or something and pull over I want to look up on the shelves and stuff make sure there ain't nothing there man I want to see what I own I want to see what was left to me amen I think we ought to look in God's word and find out what he left us because I'm AED every bit of it so if there's a promise there I want to know what it is amen and accept what God give me amen so man you might need a little ladder I might need a little ladder of prayer I might read the Bible but I might need a little ladder of prayer to me up just a little bit higher where God could Quicken that word to me sister Eve man I know many of you Christians and you know what I'm talking about when you don't know which way to turn and you get down and you begin to pray I tell you I feel like telling this and I'm going to tell this may sound strange but one night I woke up in the middle of the night and I need to use the restroom and I got up and there was an evil spirit like in the room and I thought man that's strange didn't know what it was you know I was kind of tired and sleepy little bit I'm not real sleepy headed when I wake up but you're a little disoriented and I thought what is that and it was almost it wasn't audible but almost an audible voice just almost whispered and said you're going to die brother Joel went to the restroom and I come back I didn't know I mean I didn't know what to do but I I knew that prayer changed things and I knelt down beside my bed and I just started praying and I said Lord I don't know what that is but I know it's not you and I just began to pray to the Lord and it it wasn't just a few seconds and you could almost feel one move as the other moved in when the presence of God moved in it took all that spooky demon Spirit Away it left right there and he didn't come back either [Applause] even when I'd get down and pray about this sermon I didn't know brother Joe was he he what he preached last week I know it wasn't just like be mentioned about being an air and things and I already had that on my heart and I wanted to kind of preach on it and not get down and pray and just feel the presence the Lord start moving so I just can't do anything but obey what the Lord seem as good to the Lord but I tell you I love him there's times that he's given me things I didn't deserve amen he's given me he's helped me S I didn't deserve the help but you know what he did anyway man there was a there was a story told one time that about Alexander the Great I'm sure everybody here has heard of Alexander the Great and they said that one time there was an old beggar he come to him and he said he said I I'm getting old and he said he he was just a beggar he said I don't have any place to go and he said you know I I wish that you'd give me and and he said I have a daughter and I have a son he said I don't have anything for him and he said I'm asking you if you would give me a diary for my daughter and an education for my son and he said I'd like to have a little bit of land with a house where I'll have a place to to go in my old age he said I'm just an old beggar and I don't deserve it but he said I want to ask you for that and Alexander the Great said I'll give you everything that you asked for he said I'll give you the DI he said I'll get your son a great education and he said I have land and a house where you have something to leave them and place to live until you pass somebody was standing there when he walked off and he said why would you grant that old beggar all that he asked he's just nothing but an old beggar and Alexander said you know what he said I'm tired of people nickeling Diamond me when I'm a great king and can give great gifts he said 'I finally found somebody that treated me like a king and knew that I was able to give great things and I know that sometimes we want to be humble and than oh God's not an Aaron boy and he's not but he's definitely mindful what you have need of man you get somewhere you start praying I think we ought to treat him like a king I mean I know a lot of us has heard the stories but you know brother B talked about that a little mouse being over there in those Garners in Egypt when all that grain was there and they can you imagine that little mouse going oh man I tell you I don't know if I ought to eat this seed or not because there might not be no more amen it was inexhaustable amount of grain there's no way he could ever eat it all and remember he talked about the little fish and I don't want to be the little fish in the ocean just scared to death Lord I don't know if I ought to I don't know if I ought to drink or not because I'm I will drink this ocean dry well God's greater than the ocean he's an inexhaustible like I said he's an inexhaustible Fountain tonight all you have to do is start drinking amen because we're heirs and join HS with Jesus Christ amen he's he said I love this scripture the Bible says he was wounded for our transgressions you're heir to this tonight he's bruised for our iniquity brother Joe I begin to think about that do you know what iniquity is I know you do I don't know if all of you do but you might know and can't say but if I say this wrong correct me but I believe that iniquity is to know to do something and to not do it so when Satan starts around and he says you knew better sister and do that you knew better than to do that that's why it's well guess what I ain't saying you done right I'm not saying where I've done wrong that I've Done Right CU I'm not going to say it because if it was wrong it was wrong but I'm an heir to this and you're an heir to this he was bruised for our iniquity don't you love him tonight when you have been cast out and there was not a way to turn he made you in air and he was bruised for your iniquity I say stop I stay stop being a slave to Satan and let him tell you that your past is causing you not to get this and not get that I heard brother B say and I may have quoted it to you and if I do it's worth quoting again I heard him say one time he said even if you did do something wrong that caused something to come on you because you did wrong he said you can pray and ask Lord Lord forgive me I'm sorry I didn't and let me get my healing and and just tell the Lord what you have need of do you realize that one of the things I think it was brother sheffy uh that lived in the 18th or 18th century when he lived they said one thing that was so odd about him is he talked to the Lord like he was right next to him that's the way we ought to talk to him if you have something you talk to him like he's right next to you because he is and he ain't just next to you but he's in you and tell him your problems tell him your failures Lord I'm sorry I need help brother said if your heart begins even to stray around he said get down and say Lord I can't quit this and quit that help me and restore me the joy of my salvation but he was bruised for our iniquity the chastisement of our peace was upon him and with his stripes we are healed man I'm a to every bit of that tonight I'm a to Healing I'm a to Salvation I have family that not really doing right I'm married of that too amen and I you know what I'm thankful for the presence of God even sometimes it's easy sometimes to to uh to pray you know people and and you pray and you say Lord help so and so and help this one and and I pray you'd bring so and so in and but then there's sometimes that I'm thankful and I know you probably had this happen I know many of you have but all of a sudden there's something more than just natural affection begins to move on the inside and here while back there's a family member of mine not doing right he's not he's not bad just not doing right and something began to start within my heart and I cried out to the Lord I said oh God I pray you do something man not just him but I've had other people come on my heart I have a right to it sister Joyce amen I have a right to it because I'm an heir to it I had a right the other night brother Joe as far as I know everything's I has been made right and I mean this but if you know something I ain't made right even the youngest boy or youngest girl here if you know something that you see me do and you don't think I made it right I want you to come to me the way you'd want me to come to you and be humble about it but you know what I want to be right so much I I would I would take not maybe correction that wouldn't be the right word but how old are you Connor nine if that boy come to me honest he said brother day I saw something and I I I didn't think it was right I'd won to be right sister Joyce I'd take it I'd say you know what son I was wrong if I wasn't wrong I wouldn't say I was but I I want to be that right brother Joe if you know I'm somewhere I ain't do right I want you to tell me I'm not doing right amen you pray for me and this thing's so real one of these days I'm convinced that one of these days that all that we're air to I don't know how to put it but maybe when it all comes to a head one day it's going to be a great thing brother Joel because I'm air I'm air to the millennium I'm mared can you imagine that one of these days when it becomes a reality when the Rapture takes place and I walk out you know I don't feel like I'm just Plum over the hill there's some days I may not feel like I did when I was 21 and I'm still I feel like maybe I'm not one of these young boys might say you're not but I feel like for an old guy I'm still a pretty good hos I don't know if I am or not I still have to work hard sometimes I know that and lift some stuff that I shouldn't probably be lifting on but I tell you when I walk out that day brother somewhere between 18 and 21 I'm GNA be a Hos then amen I might be jumping that high I don't know what I'll do I'll be honest with I don't I thought about and I thought you know I might jump I don't know if I will or not when I'm in his presence and I see him and I see you sister Joyce and that black hair is Flowing down back when you he was young I don't mean that disrespectful but you our hair gets gray we start getting a few wrinkles but I'm going to tell you there'll come a time brother Tom amen it's going to be different then amen all the trials that you've went through all the troubles all the tests it's going to seem like they're nothing I don't even know what time it is but I got to I'm G to have to wrap it up I'm sorry but I'll try to wrap it up here in a few minutes I'm not going to give you a time frame but I'm not going to hold you long you know know I'm not long-winded but I I've I I enjoy speaking to you and I hope something's been an encouragement to cause you to look tonight to realize that you don't have to let Satan push you around maybe you ain't got all the answers you may said at the doctor this week and the doctor May say well I got bad news but that news is only what the doctor knows when he's done all he can do I want you to know that Jesus Christ ain't done all he can do right maybe when it looks like your job's in Jeopardy take it to him I'm kind of there right now my job's not in jeopardy but I don't know what to do in life and I just have to turn it over to him I I'll be honest you'd think that as old as I'm getting I'd be wise enough to I know what I want to do but I don't know what the Lord wants me to do yet so you pray for me but I know he'll work something out because he always does amen I don't know why I tell you the Bible says confess your faults one or the other but sometimes I'm the world's I I kind of inherited that my mom was kind of that way she was a good person but she worried about bridges that she hadn't crossed yet and sometimes it's easy to start worrying when you just have to stop and go they talking the other day just let go and let God Amen because he's going control anyway unless he's your co-pilot like I said switch seats let him be the pilot and I'm B about wanting to do it myself you know that's not the way to do it just learn to let go and let God man then he'll take you to whatever you have need of Amen I'm glad that we're are you glad that you're an heir tonight how many believes that you're an heir how many let me let me ask you this you don't have to raise your hand if you don't want to if you want to that's good how many of you believe you have the baptism of the Holy Ghost well I want you to know every one of you this is to you personal every one of you I can't call all of you names but every one of you are heir to everything that Jesus Christ left you me included I'm talking to me stop let Satan push you around amen and like I said I'm sometimes the world's worst so the preachers got problems too but stop let Satan push you around man stop letting him tell you it I don't know why that come back up it might not be for anybody but stop letting Satan tell you that your past mistakes and failures is causing you problems because it's not what was that that brother wasn't that brother preaching the other night wasn't he the one that said that we set up shrines and and and statues and and and worship our past and and the problems that we had when Jesus Christ he said I'm air to it and he said he forgive me of it man it's time that we stop letting Satan tell us that we got got something that we ain't man if you're forgiven he put it in a sea of forgetfulness brother Bram said that time and I'm shutting up I'm I'm going to have to quit but brother Bram said that he saw that man he was packing that great big load brother Joe he said is that the sins of the world that always amazed me is that the sins of the world he said no that's your sins he said but he reached over he took that book he dipped his finger in his side and wrote par on the book and cast it in the sea of forgetfulness never to be remembered if God be for you then who can be against you on that day man praise the Lord I got to shut up i' I I tell you I I enjoy preaching to y'all though man y'all are such a good crowd I ain't just trying to butter you up so you overlook me preaching too long but amen this is good amen you believe it well your promise your promise tonight take hold lay hold of the promise amen sometimes it might not be easy but if you'll hold on there's one that's doing the holding that's greater than us I ain't doing no holding anyway he's doing the holding man if the music players would come I I promised you I'm shutting up and I am man what a mighty God that we serve I'm child if you would stand with me oh yes oh yes I'm a child of the [Music] king and his Ro your blood now flows through my veins and I was wretched and thow now can see praise God praise God I'm a child of the king oh yes oh yes are you a child or not of the king I'm a child of the king his Royal Blood now fls through my veins and I who was riched and by now can sing praise God praise God I'm a child of the king oh yes oh yes I'm a child just let him just for a minute just roll your

through my veins man I thank him for his presence and amen I don't know if any of you have a need but I know if you do that I'm not going to make a big pull but if you have something you have need of tonight I know that we'd be more than happy I know these brothers would to pray for you we wouldn't want to don't want to leave without giving you an invitation and anything you have need of I know that God is mindful of it amen the Bible says that in my name they'll cast out Devils I can't help believe that brother Joel amen it's not because it's I'm worthy of it is because the church was given the authority to do it by Jesus Christen so if you we'll sing this course again like I said if you have a need sister was testifying that some of the things that was preached I'll just give you the U I wouldn't be able to tell you all of it all the ins and outs but the main part that she said she was sitting in church and brother Matt was preaching here while back and something spoke to her and said that something was fixing a change with her husband's work brother John she said usually I hope she don't care for me saying this but she told me she said usually I'm the one that's freaking out and get anxiety and stuff when stuff changes and she said but no doubt just the spirit of the Lord let it become real to her sitting here in church and told her that everything's going to be all right there'll be a change but I'm in control of it she said then you come in here and preach that tonight her testimony is still the same that she may not know at all but it's going to be all right man God is Mindful and man I want you to know when you've done all when you've done all that you can do when you're all your wrongs is made right when when you've done everything that God's told you to do and you're placed as a son I know I've said it a many times but you're an heir to all that God has man whatever that might be oh yes oh yes well I'm a child of the king and his Royal Blood now flows
