[49:56] here as well Amen in St John chapter 20
[50:00] and verse number 18 you love the Lord
[50:03] tonight amen in John chapter 20 and
[50:06] verse 18 the Bible here is speaking of
[50:08] Jesus resurrection and in the 18th verse
[50:12] the Bible says Mary Magdalene came and
[50:16] told the disciples that she had seen the
[50:18] Lord and that he had spoken these things
[50:20] unto her and then the same day at
[50:23] evening being the first day of the week
[50:25] when the doors were shut where the
[50:26] disciples were assembled for fear of the
[50:29] Jews I want you to notice this came
[50:32] Jesus and stood in the midst now we know
[50:35] that Jesus is the word he was the word
[50:38] made flesh so we could very well say the
[50:40] word came and stood in their midst Jesus
[50:44] came and stood in the midst and said
[50:46] unto them peace be unto you and when he
[50:49] had so said he showed unto them his
[50:52] hands and his side and then were the
[50:54] disciples glad glad when they saw the
[50:56] Lord then said Jesus to them again peace
[51:00] be unto you as my father hath sent me
[51:04] even so send I you and when he had said
[51:07] this now I want you to catch this he
[51:09] breathed on them and saith unto them
[51:13] receive ye the Holy Ghost now whosoever
[51:16] sins ye remit they are remitted unto
[51:19] them and whosoever sins you retain they
[51:23] are retained now I love that he says as
[51:26] my father has sent me so send I you then
[51:29] he breathes on them and says receive ye
[51:31] the Holy Ghost and right after that he
[51:34] begins to speak of the authority that
[51:36] he's given to the church that has
[51:38] received the Holy Ghost amen I believe
[51:41] that tonight I believe that same
[51:42] Authority is in the church here tonight
[51:44] don't you amen we ask Lord this evening
[51:46] to add the blessing to the reading of
[51:48] his word as you can have your seats here
[51:50] this afternoon I want to by the help of
[51:52] the Lord tonight to speak to you here
[51:54] and if I will tell of this tonight I
[51:56] want to speak to you on freshly inspired
[51:59] by the Breath of God Amen freshly
[52:01] inspired by the Breath of God you know I
[52:04] believe if there ever was a time that we
[52:06] could use a refreshing I believe we
[52:08] could use it right now amen I believe we
[52:11] could use a refreshing in our homes in
[52:13] our churches and our lives amen I
[52:15] believe if there's ever been a time that
[52:17] the Believers of this end time word amen
[52:19] could use a refreshing I believe that
[52:21] time is right now now when you look at
[52:24] that word refresh of of course you know
[52:26] uh that the root word refresh is fresh
[52:29] and when you look at the definition of
[52:30] that word fresh it means to have its
[52:33] original qualities unimpaired to be full
[52:36] or renewed in Vigor not to be stale nor
[52:39] sour nor decayed not faded amen I love
[52:43] this one not altered by processing amen
[52:46] so when something is fresh it has its
[52:48] original qualities amen and those
[52:51] qualities are not decayed they're not
[52:53] faded they're not sour they're not not
[52:55] stale amen but they're still packing the
[52:58] same quality that they were packing in
[53:00] the beginning and when you look at that
[53:01] word qualities it means the standard of
[53:04] something amen as measured against other
[53:06] things of a similar kind it is the
[53:09] degree of Excellence of something there
[53:11] is a distinctive attribute or
[53:13] characteristic that is possessed amen by
[53:16] someone or something now we believe amen
[53:19] that Jesus was the word made flesh and
[53:22] the prophet said that Jesus was Poss
[53:25] amen with all the fine qualities of God
[53:28] so all that was in God Amen he poured
[53:31] into Jesus Christ and when Jesus amen
[53:34] met Satan there in Matthew 4 you will
[53:36] realize that brother BR said he did not
[53:38] use any of those qualities so he was
[53:40] full amen fully possessed of the
[53:43] qualities of God but when he met the
[53:45] devil he did not use any of those
[53:48] qualities but rather he said these words
[53:50] it is written and the prophet said see
[53:52] what he was doing was he was bringing
[53:54] the power and the authority of the word
[53:57] of God into the reach of the weakest of
[53:59] Christian amen so I believe that our
[54:01] refreshing is not coming amen from who
[54:04] we are or what church we attend or where
[54:06] we're going amen but our refreshing is
[54:09] coming from the word now I just want to
[54:11] take a minute here and read you a
[54:12] paragraph from the message here ye him
[54:15] ma Matthew 17 brother BR preaching on
[54:17] Jesus on Mount Transfiguration and he
[54:19] says you know that God's word is so
[54:22] Eternal it's so inspired that it's not
[54:24] just for one one occasion or for one
[54:26] generation he says but the word of God
[54:28] Is So Eternal it's the same and it's the
[54:31] truth amen how many can agree the word
[54:33] is the Eternal it is the same and it is
[54:36] the truth he said the same word that
[54:38] inspired the disciples it inspired the
[54:41] first Royal disciples and then the next
[54:43] as they followed down through the
[54:44] Lutheran age through the Methodist age
[54:46] and every age and it's just as
[54:48] sufficient and inspiring today to us as
[54:51] it was the first day it was given and if
[54:54] the world should stand stand a million
[54:55] years that word would still be just as
[54:58] inspired to the generations that will
[55:00] follow amen as it is to us because it is
[55:04] perfect amen it is always given for the
[55:06] time he said now one great way we could
[55:08] approach this afternoon the coming of
[55:10] the Lord see first of Moses and then
[55:12] Elijah and then Jesus he said then we
[55:15] notice that Peter while he was there
[55:17] amen he had just been freshly inspired
[55:20] because he had just given a witness to
[55:23] who Jesus was amen and he was inspired
[55:26] he said now when a man is inspired and
[55:29] he reads the inspired word then the two
[55:31] Inspirations gives a result no matter
[55:34] how well you study the word it'll never
[55:35] do you no good amen till you are
[55:38] inspired yourself amen it takes your
[55:41] inspiration the word is already inspired
[55:44] ain't that beautiful that we didn't
[55:46] gather here tonight amen to inspire the
[55:48] word but the word is already inspired
[55:51] amen but as the word begins to go forth
[55:53] there is an inspiration
[55:55] amen that is released from that word
[55:57] that falls upon your life amen and then
[55:59] you become as inspired as the word is
[56:02] inspired and the prophet said that's
[56:03] what we need today is an inspiration
[56:06] over us amen God sweeping down with a
[56:08] new inspiration and breathing over us
[56:10] his power and his love and himself amen
[56:14] that it might Inspire us and Quicken us
[56:16] and awaken us to his word amen when the
[56:19] word being brought in the spirit of
[56:20] inspiration then you'll see miracles
[56:23] happen and things take place because the
[56:26] two just comes together amen I love this
[56:29] that the word of God is not like the
[56:31] word of a man when the word of a man is
[56:33] given it's only given for a certain
[56:35] meaning or it has an expression for a
[56:37] Time amen but the word of God has an
[56:39] eternal meaning down Through the Ages
[56:41] brother B said every generation can pick
[56:44] up the same word amen because it is an
[56:46] inspired Eternal Everlasting amen
[56:50] nonfading declaration from God if the
[56:52] apostles read it it meant something for
[56:54] them him if Wesley read it it meant
[56:56] something for him if Luther and Calvin
[56:58] read it it meant something for him but
[57:01] yet today it's just as brilliant and
[57:03] bright and it's got just as much in
[57:05] effect as it did for them on the day it
[57:08] was spoken because it is God's word he
[57:11] said when God speaks it's Eternal it's
[57:13] breathed from the very breath of the
[57:16] immortal Everlasting amen Creator
[57:19] himself and listen friends we're not
[57:21] here tonight amen with a word that has
[57:23] lost its original qualities amen but the
[57:26] same qualities that the word had Amen on
[57:29] the day of Pentecost and in the
[57:31] beginning amen that word has the same
[57:33] qualities tonight if that word healed
[57:36] then that word heals now if that word
[57:39] save then that word saves now if that
[57:42] word delivered then that word delivers
[57:44] now amen because it's not the words of a
[57:46] man it's not the ideas of a denomination
[57:49] it is a nonfading declaration it is the
[57:52] Breath of God that is breathing over the
[57:54] church let me say this the message of
[57:57] the hour amen has brought the word of
[57:59] God to us unaltered amen it's not been
[58:02] processed it's not been soured down and
[58:05] diluted amen but it's got just as much
[58:07] strength it's got just as much ability
[58:10] it's got just as much anointing right
[58:12] here tonight friends amen you're in the
[58:15] way of the word and the word can do what
[58:17] the word said he can do listen this is
[58:19] not a man's word this is a king's word
[58:22] and a king's word is not altered said a
[58:25] king's word must be carried out and when
[58:27] God speaks it must be car it must be
[58:29] carried out there's no altering playing
[58:32] politics it's got to be taken out
[58:34] exactly the way he said it if it once
[58:36] spoken it's established forever in glory
[58:39] amen so when we read his word it's
[58:41] Eternal and will never cease to exist
[58:44] amen that's powerful church when we read
[58:47] his word and his word inspires us his
[58:49] word amen will never cease to exist
[58:53] listen then you are a people who have
[58:55] been born by the word and that's why the
[58:58] devil hates you amen is there's nothing
[59:00] he can do to defeat you there's nothing
[59:02] he can do to put you Amen on the
[59:05] extinction list amen you have been
[59:07] birthed by the word of God and every
[59:09] time the devil knocks us down amen the
[59:11] word is breathed over us and we get back
[59:14] up amen every time the devil attacks our
[59:17] body amen somebody breathes the word of
[59:19] Mark 16 over us and healing comes into
[59:22] our body every time the devil says we're
[59:24] not going to make it amen somebody comes
[59:26] behind the puit and says I saw you there
[59:29] amen and that's more than just a quote
[59:32] that is a nonfading declaration of the
[59:34] almighty God that devil can't stop us
[59:37] and hell can't defeat us the word is in
[59:40] the prde and she will manifest
[59:42] everything not altered not soured not
[59:45] decayed but with the same strength and
[59:48] the same Vigor amen the word must have
[59:51] preeminence amen the word must have the

[59:55] of God it must have the first place in
[59:58] the service Amen in job 32:8 amen I love
[1:00:02] what the Bible says it says there is a
[1:00:04] spirit in man and it is the inspiration
[1:00:07] of the almighty amen that giveth him
[1:00:10] understanding when you look at that word
[1:00:11] inspiration it means breath it is the
[1:00:14] spirit or the Breath of God Amen it is
[1:00:17] every breathing thing amen the spirit of
[1:00:19] man so when we read that tonight we can
[1:00:22] say it like this in other words amen the
[1:00:25] breath of the almighty amen is what
[1:00:28] giveth us the understanding in job 33:4
[1:00:31] the Bible said the spirit of God hath
[1:00:33] made me and the breath of the almighty
[1:00:37] amen hath given me life I love what the
[1:00:39] prophet says oh God who formed the
[1:00:41] heavens and the Earth and just let his
[1:00:43] breath go forth with his word and
[1:00:46] everything take in its right position
[1:00:48] amen there is a direct connection
[1:00:51] between the Breath of God Amen bringing
[1:00:53] you into your position position he said
[1:00:55] the Earth and the moon and the stars
[1:00:57] they just swung into place amen as God
[1:01:00] breathed upon his word and oh God today
[1:01:03] we ask that you'll breathe on your word
[1:01:05] as we are trying to bring it to the
[1:01:07] people may it take its position this
[1:01:10] morning its place and be rooted and
[1:01:12] grounded in every heart that we might
[1:01:15] receive the blessings of God listen
[1:01:17] every breath that we breathe amen is
[1:01:19] coming from God every breath that we
[1:01:23] breathe is coming from God now in
[1:01:25] Genesis chapter 2 amen you'll find there
[1:01:27] is the first word amen that breath is
[1:01:30] mentioned in the Bible in Genesis 2:7
[1:01:33] the Bible says and the Lord God Amen for
[1:01:36] man of the Dust of the ground and he
[1:01:38] breathed into his nostrils the breath of
[1:01:40] life amen and Man became a living soul
[1:01:43] brother man picks this up and says I can
[1:01:45] see Adam standing amen let's take it
[1:01:47] this way we see him standing like a tree
[1:01:50] amen God has made him he's not dead he
[1:01:53] said he was his dead rather as he could
[1:01:54] be amen and his toes like the roots amen
[1:01:57] was sticking in the ground amen but God
[1:02:00] said let there be amen here's Adam in
[1:02:03] the creation and his toes are in the
[1:02:05] ground amen like Roots but then God says
[1:02:08] Amen Let There Be and When God says that
[1:02:11] brother said oh he breathed the breath
[1:02:13] of life into him amen and he jumped and
[1:02:15] he came to himself amen let me say this
[1:02:18] the Breath of God Amen has the ability
[1:02:21] to bring a Son of God Amen to the
[1:02:23] recognition that they are a son of God
[1:02:26] Amen the same breath amen that breathed
[1:02:28] into Adam and he became a living soul
[1:02:31] and recognized that he was a God and he
[1:02:33] was a Son of God Amen I'm getting ahead
[1:02:35] of myself but I'm going to say it amen
[1:02:37] that's the same breath in Luke the 15th
[1:02:40] chapter amen that the prodal son was out
[1:02:43] of his position amen the prodical son
[1:02:45] was in the hog pin he didn't belong in
[1:02:48] the hog pin he belonged in the father's
[1:02:50] house amen but the same breath that
[1:02:53] brought Adam to a recognition
[1:02:54] that you don't belong here as a dead
[1:02:56] tree you are a son of God it's the same
[1:02:59] breath that breathed in the prodical son
[1:03:01] and caus him to leave the hog pin and go
[1:03:04] back to his rightful position I say
[1:03:06] that's the same breath that's brought
[1:03:08] every sinner in the house of God that's
[1:03:11] the same breath that's delivered every
[1:03:13] prodical in this generation amen because
[1:03:15] it's God breathing on the church and his
[1:03:17] word still has the same effect and the
[1:03:20] same power that it had back there amen
[1:03:23] when you begin to the Breath of God you
[1:03:25] will find amen that creation is
[1:03:28] connected to the Breath of God in Isaiah
[1:03:30] 42:5 he said thus saith God the Lord he
[1:03:34] that created the heavens and stretched
[1:03:36] them out he that spread forth the Earth
[1:03:38] and that which cometh out of it amen he
[1:03:41] that giveth breath unto the people upon
[1:03:43] it and the spirit to them that walk
[1:03:47] therein brother said you are the God who
[1:03:49] brings forth the first breath of life
[1:03:51] that ever come onto the Earth and has
[1:03:53] had control of every life until this
[1:03:56] present time amen I'm I'm laying a
[1:03:58] foundation if that's okay amen but this
[1:04:00] one just blows my mind the problem of
[1:04:02] God speaking the Breath of God he said
[1:04:04] now look he said look he said upon the
[1:04:06] mountains amen watching the great
[1:04:08] planations and so forth the great
[1:04:10] planets of the heavens and the solar
[1:04:12] system amen knowing that you made them
[1:04:14] Lord and you spun them out there with
[1:04:17] your hands now watch the prophet you
[1:04:19] blowed your breath in the palm of your
[1:04:21] hands and every Star come into existence
[1:04:25] amen before the star was in the sky amen
[1:04:28] it was in the hand of God and when he
[1:04:30] breathed into his hand amen the breath
[1:04:33] that BW across his hand amen was created
[1:04:36] breath and it created the stars and you
[1:04:38] all know what the prophet said he said
[1:04:40] the stars of God are the sons of God
[1:04:43] listen every devil in hell is trying to
[1:04:45] disposition you every spirit in hell is
[1:04:48] trying to get you out of your position

[1:04:52] on notice amen we have not put oursel
[1:04:54] here by a handshake we have not put
[1:04:57] oursel here by sigining a card amen but
[1:05:00] the same breath that blew across the
[1:05:02] hand of God and created the stars and
[1:05:04] the natural is the same breath that is
[1:05:07] blw across our lives and positionally
[1:05:09] placed us as adopted sons of God listen
[1:05:12] we are not in the hands of a man we are
[1:05:14] not in the hands of a church we are in
[1:05:16] the hands of God and the prophet of God
[1:05:19] said God wants to be God and if he ain't
[1:05:21] God he ain't going to be second place he
[1:05:23] don't have to let bail and some man make
[1:05:25] dogma and some theory of some man or
[1:05:27] some idea of a Creed or some idea of a
[1:05:30] denomination standing his way he is God
[1:05:33] and he takes what he can get in his hand
[1:05:35] he takes what he can get in his hand
[1:05:37] amen that is nothing and he breathes the
[1:05:40] breath of life into it and it becomes
[1:05:42] something amen that will serve him amen

[1:05:53] my my way to hell I was a sinner born in
[1:05:56] sin amen shaping iniquity amen but one
[1:05:59] day God picked me up amen and he
[1:06:01] breathed into his hand and when he
[1:06:03] breathed in his hand he created somebody
[1:06:06] who would say Amen to his word he
[1:06:08] created somebody that would believe he's
[1:06:11] God and there's no God above him and
[1:06:13] there's no God with him he's God and
[1:06:15] he's God alone well listen every
[1:06:17] believer here tonight you're in his
[1:06:19] hands amen you got the same power and
[1:06:22] the same Authority you've not been

[1:06:28] created to be confused you have been
[1:06:30] created by the Breath of God Amen to
[1:06:33] manifest the promises of God and there
[1:06:35] ain't enough devils in Hell there ain't
[1:06:37] enough jealous Spirits out of the pits
[1:06:39] of hell that will ever defeat you from
[1:06:41] being what God has breathed upon you to
[1:06:44] be he breathed upon you to be an
[1:06:46] overcomer he breathed upon you to be a
[1:06:48] Victor he breathed upon you to be a
[1:06:50] champion he breathed upon you to be a
[1:06:53] Victor and in this age the devil cannot
[1:06:56] stop
[1:06:57] it the Breath of God has positioned us
[1:07:01] in our place and that breath now I might
[1:07:04] as well preach that breath is a sign of
[1:07:07] life I said that breath is a sign of
[1:07:09] life and if there is no breath then
[1:07:12] there is no life come on if there is no
[1:07:14] breath amen there is no life amen let
[1:07:17] somebody fall over amen pick up the
[1:07:19] phone call 911 what's the first thing
[1:07:22] they say are they breathing
[1:07:24] amen are they breathing because they
[1:07:26] want to know oh God is there a sign of
[1:07:29] life and the prophet said now the baby's
[1:07:31] born with live
[1:07:33] muscles he's got a beating heart but no
[1:07:36] Breath of Life in it its muscles is
[1:07:38] twitching now watch he said if there
[1:07:40] wasn't a spirit that had to come into it
[1:07:42] later than our breath amen could leave
[1:07:44] us and we could breathe no more and
[1:07:45] still be alive but when this body does
[1:07:48] not receive amen oxygen or breath when
[1:07:51] this body does not receive oxygen or
[1:07:54] breath he says the intake and the
[1:07:56] outtake of our lungs amen then we are
[1:07:59] dead so you can be sitting and Tak it in
[1:08:02] and Tak it in and Tak it in and you can
[1:08:05] still be dead because the lungs have to
[1:08:08] take in and they have to outtake in
[1:08:11] other words the intake and the outtake
[1:08:13] of our lungs they work together to bring
[1:08:16] oxygen into the body amen and take
[1:08:18] carbon dioxide which is a waste product
[1:08:21] out amen so when you breathe amen when
[1:08:24] you breathe in amen you're breathing in
[1:08:27] oxygen amen but when you exhale you're
[1:08:29] letting poison and you're letting things

[1:08:34] lungs amen as you're intaking and out
[1:08:36] taking amen your lungs are getting

[1:09:12] our power back we ain't got to take in
[1:09:15] everything we've been anointed to take
[1:09:17] in some things but I might as well say
[1:09:18] it some things have got to come in and
[1:09:21] some things have got to go some things
[1:09:24] have got to come in and some things have
[1:09:27] got to go amen the word has got to come

[1:09:45] understanding has got to come in and
[1:09:48] confusion and nervousness and anxiety

[1:12:56] understanding to know how to give you
[1:12:58] praise but with breath comes
[1:13:01] understanding with breath comes
[1:13:04] understanding in other words the prophet
[1:13:06] of God said amen now I'm not emotionally
[1:13:09] but I am and anything without emotion is
[1:13:11] dead he said if you say you love
[1:13:13] somebody and you don't express that love
[1:13:16] he said then that's an expression he
[1:13:18] said now we should constantly long to be
[1:13:20] in worship to Worship the Lord to
[1:13:23] worship him at home to worship him while
[1:13:25] we're driving our cars wherever we are

[1:13:30] away your excuse tonight if that's okay
[1:13:32] the Bible said let everything that hath
[1:13:35] breath praise the Lord and he said
[1:13:37] praise ye the Lord and here's the words
[1:13:39] of our Prophet amen even if you haven't

[1:13:54] you just love that amen that sweet
[1:13:56] mellow of the holy spirit amen just
[1:13:59] breathing upon us like see it's so
[1:14:01] simple amen that all the starch and all
[1:14:04] the intellectuals of the world has been
[1:14:07] taken away and the spirits just
[1:14:09] worshiping oh church amen the spirit is
[1:14:13] just worshiping amen worshiping God
[1:14:15] through us the Holy Spirit making
[1:14:18] intercessions Hallelujah breathing out
[1:14:21] Worship in other words God created you
[1:14:25] and then he breathed upon you and he put
[1:14:27] a breath in you to praise him and then
[1:14:29] the breath that he put in you to praise
[1:14:31] him is the Tabernacle that the Holy
[1:14:34] Ghost is dwelling in and now if you got
[1:14:37] the Holy Ghost amen and you feel like
[1:14:39] praising God don't you take no backwat
[1:14:42] amen don't you take no criticism amen
[1:14:44] because it's really not you praising
[1:14:47] it's really not you doing what you're
[1:14:48] doing but it's the Holy Ghost on the
[1:14:50] inside of you amen that's wanting to
[1:14:53] praise the god that is serving oh God
[1:14:57] wherever that inspired word is wherever
[1:14:59] that inspired word is if it connects if
[1:15:02] it makes contact amen with a Believer
[1:15:05] there's going to be a
[1:15:07] praise wherever the inspired word
[1:15:10] strikes the seed in your soul there is
[1:15:12] going to be a praise let me just say
[1:15:14] this brother B we went in an noted
[1:15:16] Baptist Church here in City of Tucson so
[1:15:18] we went in there to see if we could kind
[1:15:20] of get a little fresh feeling you know
[1:15:21] he said we went in there and sit down
[1:15:23] preacher got up and got to preaching
[1:15:25] about Israel leaving Egypt he said how
[1:15:27] they didn't have to go back and eat that
[1:15:28] garlic no more and he said something
[1:15:30] like the people of the day he said we
[1:15:32] all said amen he said we all said amen
[1:15:35] he said I never seen a bunch the whole
[1:15:37] church lost side of the preacher and
[1:15:39] look back to see who it was said amen it
[1:15:41] like just scared them to death see they
[1:15:43] didn't know what it was but David said
[1:15:46] Make a Joyful Noise unto the Lord praise
[1:15:49] him on the harps praise him on the salry
[1:15:52] let everything that has breath amen
[1:15:54] praise ye the Lord can I say what a
[1:15:56] prophet said God rejoices in his
[1:16:00] people God rejoices in his people he
[1:16:04] said so let them of the learn say Amen
[1:16:07] when anything is said right amen it's
[1:16:09] not you amen it's God responding through
[1:16:13] you to his word glory to God I just say
[1:16:17] this amen you can only contain so much
[1:16:19] before you got to let an amen out you
[1:16:22] can only contain so much before you got
[1:16:24] to let a Hallelujah out amen cuz this
[1:16:26] word we're preaching is not sour and
[1:16:29] it's not stale and it's not polluted and
[1:16:31] it's not altered amen it's got the same
[1:16:34] Vigor in it that it had on Sunset
[1:16:36] Mountain it's got the same power in it
[1:16:38] that it had in the 40s and the 50s and
[1:16:40] the 60s and if it comes in the life of a
[1:16:42] Believer there's going to be somebody
[1:16:45] yield their selves to that word and
[1:16:47] manifest the potentials of it amen I
[1:16:50] love it I love to think about how amen
[1:16:52] that we've not been been born by our own
[1:16:54] life or our own breath rather we have
[1:16:55] been born by the Breath of God brother
[1:16:58] preaches that Blasphemous names and he
[1:17:00] says now I'm going to correct something
[1:17:02] here the Jehovah Witness teach this that
[1:17:04] your breath is the soul he said that's
[1:17:06] not right he said now the breath is wind
[1:17:09] and wind is what you breathe into your
[1:17:11] nostrils he goes through Genesis 2 and
[1:17:14] said but what God did he breathed the
[1:17:16] breath of eternal life amen then he
[1:17:19] become a living Soul amen a soul that
[1:17:22] cannot die now notice breathed the
[1:17:24] breath of eternal life into his nostrils
[1:17:27] and he became an eternal Soul because
[1:17:30] God breathed not what nature done but
[1:17:32] what God did he breathed the breath into
[1:17:35] his nostrils and he become a living Soul
[1:17:38] you say to me brother brandom Adam died
[1:17:40] but remember amen but remember before
[1:17:43] Adam died he had a lamb that redeemed
[1:17:46] him those who he forne he is called he
[1:17:49] got a lamb to redeem them he was a type
[1:17:52] amen Adam F fa then the lamb was
[1:17:54] provided for Adam because already in his
[1:17:56] nostrils had become the breath of the
[1:17:59] Eternal God and he became a living Soul
[1:18:03] he was a Son of God now breath he says
[1:18:06] as the African word they use the word
[1:18:08] Amo he said which means the wind or an
[1:18:11] unseen Force he said but listen animals
[1:18:14] breathe amoya amen and sinners breathe
[1:18:16] Amo he said but God upon Adam he
[1:18:19] breathed the breath of eternal life and
[1:18:21] he became an eternal person with God he
[1:18:24] had power like God he was an amateur God
[1:18:27] he was God of the earth not God Of
[1:18:29] Heaven he was God of the earth now watch
[1:18:31] a prophet and someday the sons of God
[1:18:35] will become Gods
[1:18:37] again then when Adam fell amen the
[1:18:40] breath did not die amen but the breath
[1:18:43] has come into the church and this the
[1:18:45] father has sent me so send I you listen
[1:18:48] friends amen if anybody got a right to
[1:18:51] praise God if anybody got to right to
[1:18:53] confess the word of God is the Bride of
[1:18:55] Jesus Christ who has been born amen for
[1:18:58] a Time such as this amen I'll tell you
[1:19:00] what the devil don't want you to do he
[1:19:02] don't want you to come to yourself he
[1:19:04] don't want the Breath of God to come
[1:19:06] into you and cause you to come to
[1:19:08] yourself because when you come to
[1:19:10] yourself he's lost himself when you come
[1:19:13] to yourself that devil is finished but I
[1:19:15] say old tonight let the Breath of God
[1:19:18] breathe across the church and let the
[1:19:20] Believers come to themselves and
[1:19:22] recognize we're not a bunch of poor
[1:19:24] peasants we're not a bunch of begly
[1:19:25] church members we are the sons of God in
[1:19:28] the last days who have been prophesied
[1:19:30] to be here in the age we're living in I
[1:19:33] say this with everything within me the
[1:19:35] true church is you and the true church
[1:19:37] is born by the Breath of God listen we
[1:19:41] didn't join the church we were born in
[1:19:43] the church by the word that's why bad
[1:19:46] days can't take us out that's why
[1:19:48] depression can't take us out that's why
[1:19:50] sickness can't take us out it's cuz we
[1:19:52] didn't come in by those things and we're
[1:19:54] not going out by those things I might as
[1:19:56] well preach that's why our favorite
[1:19:58] singer can't bring us in and our
[1:19:59] favorite singer can't take us
[1:20:01] out that's why our favorite preacher
[1:20:03] can't bring us in and our favorite
[1:20:05] preacher can't take us out come on
[1:20:07] church that's why a gift cannot bring us
[1:20:09] in and a gift cannot take us out we come
[1:20:12] into this P the jees of almighty God
[1:20:15] born by the word Eternal with God he
[1:20:17] said that's how we have eternal life
[1:20:19] because we were spoken into existence by
[1:20:22] God not joined into a church but born by
[1:20:26] the word the original seed that God said
[1:20:29] let there be and there was listen
[1:20:32] friends God watches over his word and
[1:20:35] God Reveals His word then his word must
[1:20:38] have the preeminence can I say this to
[1:20:40] you the revelation of the word is the
[1:20:43] inspiration of the age there's a million
[1:20:46] people carrying the same Bible you're
[1:20:48] carrying and they're living without
[1:20:50] Revelation but in the last days
[1:20:52] according to Malachi 4 Luke 17:30
[1:20:55] Revelation 10 amen the son of man would
[1:20:58] be revealed again and the prophet said
[1:21:00] when you see the church getting worly
[1:21:02] like it was in the days of Sodom see the
[1:21:04] church all going in the worship of the
[1:21:06] God of this eil evil age but then you'll
[1:21:08] see a little minority group they'll be
[1:21:11] gathered out there under the inspiration
[1:21:13] of God and they will be producing again
[1:21:16] the life of Jesus Christ by the same
[1:21:19] scriptures that's supposed to happen you
[1:21:21] know what power you're living in oh
[1:21:24] Church we're not living under some man's
[1:21:27] inspiration we're not living under a
[1:21:28] Church's inspiration but we're living
[1:21:31] under the influence of the third po that
[1:21:33] is open the word to the church come on
[1:21:35] friends I think it's time to turn away
[1:21:37] and Look Away to Jesus look away from
[1:21:40] this problem look away from this
[1:21:41] situation well this church is doing that
[1:21:43] and this preacher is doing this and this
[1:21:45] church is doing that amen forget it all
[1:21:48] and Look Away to Jesus again and see him
[1:21:51] high and see him whole ho and see him as
[1:21:53] The God Who was the god who is and the
[1:21:56] god which shall ever be come on I think
[1:21:59] it's time to remember God sent a message
[1:22:01] and I think it's time to look at that
[1:22:03] message and forget everything contrary
[1:22:05] to that message and stand with the
[1:22:07] message of the hour if you have to stand
[1:22:10] alone Church stand there because
[1:22:12] somewhere in the shadows you'll find
[1:22:15] Jesus he'll stand with you he'll never
[1:22:18] leave you he'll never forsake you don't
[1:22:20] you get out from under this inspiration
[1:22:23] don't you get out from under this
[1:22:24] inspiration you stay under it you live
[1:22:27] under this inspiration let this
[1:22:29] inspiration change you now the prophet
[1:22:32] of God said what's happening right now
[1:22:34] and this is what the devil hates he said
[1:22:36] no man come to me except my father draws
[1:22:38] him and all the father has given me will
[1:22:40] come are you ready for this it's the
[1:22:43] word joining with the word yes
[1:22:46] sir the word is joining with the word in
[1:22:51] other words we are called by the word
[1:22:54] the written word has called out to the
[1:22:58] predestinated word and there has been a
[1:23:01] union there has been a marriage take
[1:23:03] place between the written word and the
[1:23:06] predestinated word and you are the fruit
[1:23:08] of that
[1:23:10] Union you have been called by the word
[1:23:13] somebody say the word word now if we're
[1:23:15] this far into it let's go and say this
[1:23:17] what a prophet says are we sufficiently
[1:23:20] impressed with the word in our
[1:23:24] midst the Bible said that Jesus walked
[1:23:27] in a room and there were Jews in there
[1:23:30] that were afraid over what was taking
[1:23:32] place but he walked in there and the
[1:23:35] word came in their midst and when the
[1:23:37] word come in their midst the word
[1:23:39] rebuked the fear and release them of the
[1:23:42] questions the prophet said Jesus knew
[1:23:44] there was going to be a terrible drift
[1:23:45] away from the word in the pergan age
[1:23:47] which was yet 200 years off from the
[1:23:50] patmas vision he knew the drift would
[1:23:52] caus him to go in the Dark Ages he knew
[1:23:54] the way man would originally get away
[1:23:55] from God was by first leaving the word
[1:23:58] if you leave the word you have left God
[1:24:01] thus he has presented himself to the
[1:24:03] church at pergamus and indeed to all
[1:24:05] churches of all ages and here's what
[1:24:08] he's saying I am the word if you want
[1:24:12] deity in your midst then welcome and
[1:24:14] receive the word don't you ever let
[1:24:16] anything or anyone get between you and
[1:24:19] that word this which I'm giving you the
[1:24:21] word is a revelation of myself I am the
[1:24:26] word remember
[1:24:28] that don't you let anything or anyone
[1:24:32] get between you and the word I am the
[1:24:34] word remember that he said I wonder then
[1:24:37] if we are sufficiently amen impressed
[1:24:40] with the word that's in our midst he
[1:24:42] begins to talk about the word and how
[1:24:44] you should pray in the name of Jesus
[1:24:45] then he says there it is if it isn't in
[1:24:48] the word you can't have it so we can't
[1:24:50] ask unless it's in the word word and we
[1:24:53] cannot petition or ask unless it's in
[1:24:55] his name there it is again Jesus
[1:24:57] somebody shout Jesus the name is the
[1:25:01] word brother says will you cannot
[1:25:03] separate God and the word they are one
[1:25:06] now then the word that he has left
[1:25:08] behind on the printed page is a part of
[1:25:11] him when you accept it by faith into a
[1:25:15] spirit filled life he said there it is
[1:25:17] he is spirit and he is life here it is
[1:25:19] church so when a spirit born spirit
[1:25:22] filled man in faith takes the word into
[1:25:25] his heart and places it upon his lips
[1:25:27] while that is the same as deity speaking
[1:25:31] Every Mountain has to go come on Church
[1:25:34] Satan cannot stand before that
[1:25:37] man I tell you why the devil wants to
[1:25:40] take the word out of the church it's
[1:25:41] because he wants to take the power of
[1:25:43] the word out of the church if he can
[1:25:44] separate you from the word that he can
[1:25:46] run you around he can paralyze you he
[1:25:49] can taunt you amen but if you ever
[1:25:51] recognize amen that the word has stepped
[1:25:54] into Grace Tabernacle and you join
[1:25:56] yourself with that word and you say come
[1:25:58] whatever I'm not leaving the word deity
[1:26:02] will be in your
[1:26:03] midst Hallelujah notice he said are we
[1:26:06] sufficiently impressed with the word now
[1:26:09] I want to say this the prophet did not
[1:26:11] say sufficiently impressed with
[1:26:13] signs he said word although we believe
[1:26:17] in signs but let me say what a prophet
[1:26:20] said signs can be impersonated
[1:26:22] but the word cannot be impersonated the
[1:26:25] devil can impersonate a sign but he
[1:26:28] cannot impersonate the word now I'm just
[1:26:30] going to is it okay if I preach brother
[1:26:32] Matt amen I'm going to read a quote
[1:26:34] where the prophet of God said more and
[1:26:35] more I made to believe that people are
[1:26:37] not getting to Christ and you know what
[1:26:39] a bunch of a bunch of bunch of reprobate
[1:26:41] Spirits has done with that quote is
[1:26:43] they've said well the message is one
[1:26:45] thing and Christ is another Amen brother
[1:26:47] Bram never separated Christ in this
[1:26:49] message he said this message is Christ
[1:26:52] amen you don't get somebody to Christ
[1:26:54] and then get them to the message amen I
[1:26:56] say get them to the message and you get
[1:26:58] them to the way to the truth to the life
[1:27:00] get him to the message you get him to
[1:27:02] the atonement in action get him to the
[1:27:04] message and you have just introduced him
[1:27:06] to the identified characteristic of
[1:27:09] Jesus Christ and it's not a natural
[1:27:11] characteristic it's a supernatural
[1:27:13] characteristic oh may I announce to you
[1:27:15] tonight this is not a natural church
[1:27:17] with a bunch of intellectual starchy
[1:27:19] formal ideas this is a supernatural
[1:27:21] Church church that has been birthed by
[1:27:24] the Breath of God and the fire of God
[1:27:27] and the power of God has come in the
[1:27:29] Church of God and there's a strength in
[1:27:31] this church we know how to overcome we
[1:27:33] know how to move mountains we know how
[1:27:35] to heal we know how to pray we know how
[1:27:38] to believe for a miracle by the word of
[1:27:41] God we're not a bunch of a bunch of
[1:27:43] babies don't know nothing we're Sons and
[1:27:45] Daughters of God and we know the word is
[1:27:48] in our midst and that word has supreme
[1:27:50] authority over every SP Spirit over
[1:27:53] every gift over every sign over
[1:27:55] everything the word has the preeminence
[1:27:57] in our
[1:27:59] midst and we're joined to that word and
[1:28:02] the prophet of God said now let me say
[1:28:04] this there's one thing he cannot
[1:28:06] impersonate he said he cannot
[1:28:08] impersonate the word in the debate
[1:28:10] between he and Jesus each time Jesus
[1:28:13] said it is written the word he never
[1:28:17] relied on his
[1:28:19] qualities but the qualities that was in
[1:28:22] the word was in
[1:28:24] him in other words you didn't get down
[1:28:27] here to Le osia and God say oh mercy I
[1:28:30] got to come up with a new way for Jonah
[1:28:32] to overcome I got to find a new way for
[1:28:34] Jonah and for the young people to get
[1:28:36] out of Le seea no he knew that his word
[1:28:39] would be inspired from the first time it
[1:28:41] was given oh god listen till the last
[1:28:45] time it was spoken his word would be
[1:28:47] inspired so he knew when you showed up

[1:33:22] miracle see the miracle takes place on
[1:33:24] the word tell you why the devil hates
[1:33:27] you is cuz there's going to be times
[1:33:29] that you as an individual the devil
[1:33:31] wants to lead you by your flesh he wants
[1:33:33] to lead you by your spirit but there is
[1:33:35] a soul in there that has got a Channel
[1:33:38] of inspiration and sometimes it gets
[1:33:41] clogged but the prophet of God said it
[1:33:44] got clogged to job one day he said but
[1:33:46] job had this Revelation amen I know in
[1:33:49] whom I have believed he said now want he
[1:33:51] couldn't get a word from God but the
[1:33:54] devil could not move
[1:33:57] him there was a time that job could not
[1:34:00] get a word from God but the devil could
[1:34:03] not move him he said when you know
[1:34:04] you've done exactly what God told you to
[1:34:06] do then see just wait for the channel of
[1:34:09] inspiration to open up to you and say
[1:34:11] now I'm Healed and when it drops in
[1:34:13] there then it's all over see you don't
[1:34:16] need a prayer line nothing else it's
[1:34:18] been revealed to you can I say this look
[1:34:20] at Simeon amen it was revealed to him

[1:34:29] nothing somebody say nothing nothing
[1:34:31] could shake him amen because it was
[1:34:34] revealed to him I love way the prophet
[1:34:37] says this no matter how many babies he
[1:34:39] would visit each day he knew that God
[1:34:42] had revealed to him that he was going to
[1:34:44] see the Christ before he died no matter
[1:34:48] how many babies now come on think about
[1:34:50] it Simeon was an old man his shoulders
[1:34:52] were stooped his back was probably
[1:34:54] hurting he was about ready amen he was
[1:34:56] just saying Lord I want to go on home
[1:34:58] some days but he had a revelation
[1:35:00] hanging over his life and the devil
[1:35:03] could not impersonate that Revelation by
[1:35:05] saying here's the child but there was
[1:35:07] something in simeon's heart that knew
[1:35:10] when I see that baby there will be a
[1:35:12] true certain sound that this is the
[1:35:14] Christ child let me say this amen don't
[1:35:17] you accept nothing less than a found oh

[1:35:44] he said when you get that enemy of
[1:35:45] yourself out of the way then you get to
[1:35:47] a place that God can come over and he
[1:35:49] can do things that William brandom knows
[1:35:51] nothing about see when we're out of the
[1:35:55] way come on now when we're out of the

[1:53:22] Church the devil's bowing on you cuz
[1:53:24] he's trying to sink you but God is
[1:53:26] bowing the breath of his word on you
[1:53:29] because there's a new testament
[1:53:32] church and it's rising up we're not
[1:53:35] getting weaker we're getting stronger
[1:53:38] we're not defeated we're
[1:53:41] Overcomers there's a wind of
[1:53:45] God there's a wind of
[1:53:48] God and when it begins to
[1:53:52] blow when it begins to
[1:53:55] blow things begin to
[1:53:58] change don't
[1:54:02] say when he begins to breathe things
[1:54:05] begin to
[1:54:09] change can I can I leave you at this
[1:54:13] tonight what happens in the natural is
[1:54:16] happening in the spiritual
[1:54:23] God has cleaned the air up in the
[1:54:28] church do you realize in n in in in the
[1:54:32] in America in the United States of
[1:54:33] America there's something called the
[1:54:34] Clean Air
[1:54:36] Act the United States started this and
[1:54:40] their intention was to reduce and
[1:54:41] control air
[1:54:43] population it was an act to improve and
[1:54:46] strengthen and accelerate programs for
[1:54:48] the prevention and abandonment of air
[1:54:51] pollution brother Wayne I got to looking
[1:54:53] at this and you know the year that that
[1:54:56] was enacted was
[1:55:03] 1963 in other words when America is
[1:55:06] nationally wide trying to stop air
[1:55:09] pollution in the
[1:55:11] natural a prophet receives an open book
[1:55:15] and begins to reveal the Mysteries and
[1:55:17] begins to improve the air quality in the
[1:55:19] church
[1:55:20] and you go from breathing in polluted
[1:55:22] denominational stagnated air that chokes
[1:55:25] you and you can't believe in healing and
[1:55:27] you can't believe in miracles and you
[1:55:29] can't believe in the Supernatural till a
[1:55:31] prophet opened the word and he put a
[1:55:33] filter in the church he put an air
[1:55:35] filter in the church and he said now if
[1:55:37] it's not in the word don't worry about
[1:55:39] it put it out of the
[1:55:42] church he clean the pollution up in the
[1:55:45] church he cleaned the pollution up in
[1:55:48] the church he he breathed on them and
[1:55:51] said receive ye the Holy
[1:55:55] Ghost he breathed on them and said
[1:55:58] receive you the Holy Ghost why don't you
[1:55:59] to stand to your feet with us
[1:56:03] tonight he breathed on them look at this
[1:56:07] word breathe it means to blow or breathe
[1:56:10] upon where Jesus after the manner of the
[1:56:13] Hebrew prophets expressed by the
[1:56:14] symbolic Act of breathing upon the
[1:56:16] apostles the communication of the power
[1:56:18] of the I got here too late of the power
[1:56:22] of the spirit G of the Holy Spirit giv
[1:56:24] them this word was only used by the by
[1:56:26] the translators Genesis 27 when God
[1:56:27] breathed on Adam and he became a living
[1:56:29] soul but watch this just as the original
[1:56:32] creation was completed by an act of God
[1:56:34] so to the new creation was to be
[1:56:37] completed by an act from the head of the
[1:56:40] new creation he said see he's created
[1:56:43] his bride not to a denomination but by
[1:56:46] the word he said see he was the head of
[1:56:49] the new race he's the head of the new
[1:56:51] creation can I can I leave you with this
[1:56:53] tonight and a prophet turns and says now
[1:56:56] the breath and the spirit has become the
[1:56:58] same and she's uniting together bringing
[1:57:02] forth the same powerful bow of the Holy
[1:57:05] Ghost like he did back there is
[1:57:08] manifesting the same Works John 14:12
[1:57:11] that he did back there is being
[1:57:13] manifested right today the same thing oh
[1:57:18] Lord not you that
[1:57:21] speaketh he says but the father that
[1:57:23] dwelleth in you he doeth a talking it's
[1:57:26] not you talking to that
[1:57:29] mountain it's the father that's in you
[1:57:32] speaking to that mountain it has to move
[1:57:37] can I say what he said she's bone of his
[1:57:39] bone she's life of his life she's power
[1:57:43] of his power prophet of God stood and
[1:57:45] said I challenge you to believe that the
[1:57:47] son of man is revealed in human flesh
[1:57:50] through the bride's body she is
[1:57:53] him she's
[1:58:00] him oh I see a I see a valley it's a
[1:58:04] valley of dry
[1:58:06] bones brother Wendell can they live
[1:58:10] again Lord can these bones live again
[1:58:14] Lord thou knowest son of man
[1:58:18] prophesy oh God Son of Man

[1:58:26] listening to it thou must prophesy
[1:58:29] again somebody's going to eat this book
[1:58:31] and prophesy again and when he stood
[1:58:34] there he began to he begin to look at
[1:58:36] those bones and brother Vernon let's
[1:58:38] just say it like this there was a Vernon
[1:58:40] and a Robbie in that Valley and Vernon
[1:58:42] had a backbone and Robbie had a backbone
[1:58:44] and Vernon had a kneebone and Robbie had
[1:58:46] a knee bone amen and when the when the
[1:58:48] bones were laying there no doubt Them
[1:58:50] Bones had all been scattered they had
[1:58:52] all been scattered but he said Can these
[1:58:54] bones live again he said Son of Man
[1:58:57] prophesy and as he began to speak sen
[1:59:00] you came and muscle came and flesh came
[1:59:03] but there was still no life he said but
[1:59:06] prophesy to the Four Winds and let them
[1:59:08] come in those bones and when he began to
[1:59:10] prophesy the Bible said bone went to his
[1:59:13] bone in other words brother Robbie you
[1:59:15] didn't get brother Vernon's backbone and
[1:59:17] he didn't get your your ankle bone every
[1:59:19] bone went back to a
[1:59:22] trap are you hearing me and the only
