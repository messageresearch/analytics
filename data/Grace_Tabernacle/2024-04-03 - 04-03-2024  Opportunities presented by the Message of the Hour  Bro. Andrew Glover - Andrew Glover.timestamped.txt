[41:47] just moving Among Us and doing
[41:49] Supernatural things and amen I believe
[41:51] he's right here tonight to do it again
[41:53] amen amen St John the 18th chapter and
[41:57] the 37th verse the Bible here says
[41:59] pilate therefore said unto him art thou
[42:03] a king then and Jesus answered thou
[42:06] sayest that I am a king to this end was
[42:09] I born and for this cause came I into
[42:13] the world now watch this that I should
[42:15] bear witness of the truth and everyone
[42:18] that is of the truth heareth my voice
[42:22] the pilate saith unto him what is truth
[42:25] that's a that's a little question but
[42:26] it's a big question
[42:27] what is truth and when he had said this
[42:30] he went out again unto the Jews and sath
[42:32] unto them I find no I find in him no
[42:36] fault at all so right there Christ was
[42:39] pronounced Innocent but ye have ACC
[42:42] custom that I should release unto you
[42:43] one at the Passover will you therefore
[42:46] that I release unto you the king of the
[42:48] Jews and they cried they all again
[42:51] saying not this man but barabus so they
[42:55] didn't want the word they wanted a
[42:57] robber because the Bible said now
[43:00] barabus was a robber so they turned down
[43:03] truth and accepted a robber amen we ask
[43:06] Lord this evening to add the blessing to
[43:08] the reading of his word as you can be
[43:09] seated here this afternoon amen we want
[43:12] you by the help of the Lord tonight just
[43:14] to take a few moments here and if I
[43:16] title this tonight I want to speak to
[43:17] you on opportunities presented by the
[43:20] message of the hour amen opportunities
[43:23] presented by the message of the hour
[43:25] when you look at this word opportunity
[43:27] it is a set of circumstances that makes
[43:30] it possible to do something it is a
[43:32] chance for success or advancement occurs
[43:35] so when there is an opportunity
[43:38] something has been put together
[43:40] something has been planned out something
[43:42] has been fixed so that you could
[43:44] actually move forward or you could
[43:46] Advance now I love what the prophet of
[43:47] God says in the Easter seal 65 he said
[43:50] oh Christian what an opportunity we have
[43:53] we have opportunities that St Paul never
[43:56] dreamed of having we have opportunities
[43:58] that Enoch and Elijah and all them never
[44:00] had amen the opportunities that we have
[44:04] now amen these opportunities are not in
[44:07] the future and they're not in the past
[44:09] but these opportunities are actually
[44:11] present tense now the Bible says in 1
[44:14] John 3 and verse one behold what manner
[44:16] of love the father hath bestowed upon us
[44:19] that we should be called the sons of God
[44:22] see therefore the world knoweth us not
[44:24] because it knew him not so here he men
[44:27] is the Lord speaking through John
[44:29] declaring amen that the world did not
[44:31] know the Lord so they're not going to
[44:33] know the sons of the Lord amen but he
[44:35] says beloved now are we the sons of God
[44:38] so this is not in the future that we're
[44:40] going to be the sons of God but right
[44:42] now amen we are the sons of God and it
[44:45] does not yet appear what we shall be but
[44:48] we know that when he shall appear we
[44:50] shall be like him amen for we shall see
[44:52] him as he is now I want to say this
[44:55] tonight thank God amen for sending us a
[44:58] Vindicated Prophet messenger amen with
[45:01] the absolute message amen that would
[45:03] bring us to a complete identification
[45:06] amen that we are the sons of God see
[45:09] amen we're not just partially identified
[45:11] as the children of God Amen when we feel
[45:14] good or when we're at camp or when we're
[45:15] in a meeting but as the message of the
[45:17] hour has been laid across this
[45:19] generation we have come to a complete
[45:21] identity amen that we are sons of God
[45:24] Amen and we are believers now I'm just
[45:27] drawn some inspiration from a quote in
[45:29] power of transformation brother says we
[45:31] are now ready for a battle how many's
[45:32] ready for the battle amen the trumpet is
[45:35] to sound the hymns have been sang he
[45:37] said and now comes the word but to hear
[45:39] these comments amen of these young
[45:41] soldiers here he said myself getting old
[45:43] and listen around and your faith and
[45:45] confidence and what you have placed in
[45:47] to believe the message that I have been
[45:49] given of God now if it wasn't for you
[45:52] all amen the message would do no good
[45:55] now amen let's not just leave this all
[45:57] the way back in
[45:58] 1965 amen but let's bring it right here
[46:00] tonight if it wasn't for you all amen
[46:03] the message would do no good see it's
[46:05] got to be somebody Amen to believe it
[46:08] see and as long as it's coming from God
[46:11] Amen there's going to be somebody
[46:12] believe it you see because God has made
[46:15] a way he has affixed his great economy
[46:18] like that that when he sends forth
[46:20] something there is something there Amen
[46:22] to meet that something see in other
[46:24] words God had arranged to send a message
[46:27] in the last days amen but he did not
[46:29] send it hoping somebody amen would show
[46:32] up to believe it but when God sent this
[46:34] message amen through the forn knowledge
[46:36] of God he knew amen that you would be
[46:39] here amen and when the message arrived
[46:42] you would arrive amen listen there is
[46:44] not a chance that you're going to miss
[46:45] this message there is not a chance
[46:47] you're going to miss this Rapture amen
[46:50] God has so fix this thing amen that when
[46:52] he begins to sound there will be
[46:54] somebody on the earth to believe what he
[46:56] is hand amen the Deep will respond to
[46:59] the call of the deep he said see it's
[47:01] got to be that way an't that beautiful
[47:04] however God fixes something it cannot be
[47:07] another way it's got to be the exact way
[47:10] that God has a fixed for it to be and I
[47:12] say this if we are here and I believe we
[47:14] are then God has sent this message and
[47:17] it must be received as Divine in 1
[47:20] Thessalonians 213 the Bible said this
[47:22] cause also amen we thank god without
[47:25] ceasing because when you receive the
[47:27] word of God which you heard of us you
[47:30] received it not as the word of men but
[47:32] watch what Paul says but as it is in the
[47:34] truth amen as it is in truth the word of
[47:37] God Amen which effectually worketh also
[47:40] in you amen that figure everything out
[47:43] amen and you that reason everything out
[47:45] and you that memorizes everything no my
[47:48] Bible says the word of God worketh
[47:50] effectually Amen in you that believe see
[47:53] the prophet of God said we must receive
[47:55] amen and believe the the message let me
[47:58] say this we must believe it and we must
[48:00] receive it at the same degree or the
[48:03] same level that it was sent in amen and
[48:05] I want to say this it was not delivered
[48:08] casually it was not delivered
[48:10] half-heartedly it was not delivered Luke
[48:12] horley amen but this message was
[48:15] delivered with passion amen let me say
[48:17] this the prophet of God taed it to Rahab
[48:20] amen receiving her message and he said
[48:22] when Rahab received that message she
[48:24] received it with urgency amen and she
[48:26] went out there and went to work amen to
[48:28] get everybody under the token amen that
[48:31] Joshua had provided and the prophet of
[48:33] God brings it to the Token in our day
[48:35] and says oh God let us open up our
[48:37] hearts and receive the message that
[48:39] Jesus is Alive tonight he is right here
[48:42] Among Us he is the same yesterday today
[48:45] and forever amen open up your house and
[48:48] let the messenger the Holy Ghost come in
[48:50] and identify You by his own presence
[48:53] amen the token that's upon you then you
[48:55] don't have to take no nobody else's word
[48:57] for it amen he is here to speak for
[49:00] himself amen and he here is the word
[49:03] amen can I say this we're not gathered
[49:05] here tonight amen taking what somebody
[49:07] said about this message we're not
[49:09] gathered here taking what somebody
[49:10] thinks about this message amen but we
[49:13] are a part of the economy of God and God
[49:16] has fixed it in this generation that we
[49:18] will stand here tonight as Witnesses
[49:20] amen that God is a savior that God Is A
[49:23] Healer that God is a miracle worker that
[49:26] God is a wa maker God is a restorer God
[49:29] is a Soul Saver listen there's no
[49:31] mountain too big enough there's no
[49:33] Valley too wide there's no trial too
[49:35] hard amen but what this message amen
[49:38] cannot come into your heart and identify
[49:40] this is the return amen of the
[49:43] Vindicated presence of almighty God Amen
[49:46] I love how the prophet delivers this
[49:47] message he was not he was not wondering

[50:47] said I'm so thankful to have a people
[50:49] like you amen what would my message be
[50:52] if I had nobody that believed it he said
[50:55] but there is a people here amen that you
[50:57] would die for it amen for this message
[51:00] we got he said may God help each one of
[51:02] you and may you not forget that you're a
[51:05] part in that Resurrection amen the
[51:07] quickening power is now in you amen it's
[51:10] all settled amen you are God's child
[51:13] amen before a prophet walked off the
[51:15] scene amen he settled the question amen
[51:18] of whether you are a child of God or not
[51:21] he said the quickening power is already
[51:23] in you amen you are already a part of
[51:26] this resur Direction hey the devil can
[51:28] do whatever he wants to this body amen
[51:30] but he cannot destroy the soul amen cuz
[51:33] the soul has already passed amen from
[51:35] Death un life amen I want to put hell on
[51:37] notice tonight amen I am a holy ghost
[51:40] fill fire baptized Malachi for following
[51:44] Pillar of Fire anointed son of the
[51:46] Living God it don't matter what Devil
[51:48] Comes our way we're going to throw up
[51:50] our hands and praise God it don't matter
[51:52] what trials and what situations amen we
[51:55] are here amen for the cuse of the
[51:57] message of the hour we know where we
[51:59] come from we know where we're standing
[52:01] and we know where we're going yeah we
[52:03] have bad days yeah we have dry spelles
[52:06] but when the dust settles and the Smoke
[52:08] Clears we are still a part of the Lamb's
[52:10] Book of Life and there ain't enough
[52:12] devils in hell to remove our names from
[52:15] the identification that was spoken by
[52:17] the word of God hey we didn't come here
[52:21] to play games we come here as word born
[52:23] Believers hey the quickening power is
[52:25] now in you you it's all settled you're
[52:28] God's child look at somebody and say
[52:31] it's settled you belong to

[52:40] don't matter what the devil says you
[52:42] belong to God it don't matter what the
[52:44] devil says brother Vernon we've had a
[52:46] word Prophet who has said it's settled
[52:48] you belong to God listen if I was here
[52:51] questioning whether he was convinced or
[52:53] not but when he said that he was
[52:55] convinced that what he was saying was
[52:57] coming from God and I am convinced to
[53:00] believe that what he was saying was
[53:02] coming from God and if it was good
[53:03] enough for him to say it's good enough
[53:05] for us to believe and defeat every devil
[53:08] of confusion defeat every devil of
[53:10] negativity defeat every devil of
[53:12] depression come on church amen a prophet
[53:14] spoke over you and said quickening power
[53:17] is already in you now when God sends a
[53:21] message the prophet tells us there's
[53:23] three things that God gives when he
[53:25] speaks to a man now I believe that
[53:27] according to Hebrews one amen that God
[53:29] still
[53:30] speaks can we all agree that God Amen
[53:34] still speaks God who at sunright times
[53:36] and diverse men are spake in times past
[53:39] under the fathers by the prophets man
[53:41] it's a bad night for the devil to be
[53:42] here amen spoke by the prophets amen
[53:45] hath in these last days spoken unto us
[53:47] amen by his son whom Heath appointed
[53:50] heir of All Things by whom also he made
[53:53] the world now I want you to look at this
[53:55] word spoken it means to use words in
[53:57] order to declare one's mind and to
[54:00] disclose one thoughts so when somebody
[54:03] begins to speak they're not just pulling
[54:05] things out of midair but there's
[54:07] something in their mind that they're
[54:09] using their voice Amen to declare what's
[54:12] in their mind in other words amen God
[54:15] sent a prophet in this generation Amen
[54:17] to declare what was on the back part of
[54:20] God's mind listen we are not feeding on
[54:22] the mind of a man we are feeding on the
[54:24] unfailing body word of the son of man
[54:27] listen church that's why we can say Amen
[54:29] when we feel lower than a snake's belly
[54:31] that's why we can believe the promises
[54:33] of God when the devil Stacks all kinds
[54:35] of things on us amen because we come
[54:38] amen from the back part of God's mind
[54:40] and God sent a prophet in this

[56:35] truth when God speaks he speaks the
[56:38] truth I love John 18:37 amen I don't
[56:41] have time to break all of it down but
[56:43] from the Amplified Bible he said so
[56:45] pilate said to him amen then you are a
[56:48] king and Jesus answered you say
[56:50] correctly that I am a king this is why I
[56:53] was born for this for this have I come
[56:56] into the world to testify to the truth
[56:59] so Jesus is standing before the man who
[57:02] is getting ready to put him on the cross
[57:04] so to speak amen and he's not lost his
[57:07] confession in the face of iniquity in
[57:09] the face come on amen amen they they
[57:11] they they accused him without anything
[57:13] to prove it by but he still stood there
[57:16] upon this confession that the reason I
[57:19] came into this Earth the whole reason
[57:21] I'm here is to testify to the truth
[57:24] everyone who is of the truth amen I love
[57:26] how this breaks it down everyone who is
[57:28] of the truth who is a friend of the
[57:30] truth and belongs to the truth amen

[57:43] giving birth to Children brother said
[57:45] recently Lord upon the basis of Thy word
[57:47] and the Holy Spirit we are so glad to
[57:50] know where our birth comes from he said
[57:52] you have got to be born the will of God
[57:55] Amen not the will of man am the will of
[57:56] Flesh amen but will of God to be saved
[58:00] so here is Jesus the word right amen
[58:02] standing in the face of pilot amen and
[58:05] he looks at pilate and says I have come
[58:07] into this world Amen to do one thing and
[58:10] that is to testify of the truth can I
[58:12] say this Jesus's trial amen of his death
[58:16] could not back him off of his purpose of
[58:18] being here and the Bible said the word
[58:20] was made flesh and dwelt among us and we
[58:23] beheld his glory and So Glorious the
[58:26] only begotten of the father love this
[58:28] brother Joe amen full of grace and truth
[58:31] amen when Jesus was standing before
[58:33] pilot if pilot could only recognize amen
[58:36] who was standing in front of him amen
[58:39] was the word made flesh and he was full
[58:41] of grace and he was full of Truth oh God
[58:44] have mercy amen pilate was standing in
[58:47] the presence of Pardon he was standing
[58:49] in the presence of the one amen that
[58:51] could say one word and remove everything
[58:53] over his life amen but for this PA he
[58:56] had come into the world Amen and he
[58:58] stood there in his position against
[59:00] opposition and said I've come from God
[59:03] and I must go back to God I love this
[59:06] amen the people of God are of the truth
[59:08] the people of God are a friend of the
[59:10] truth hey can I say this and the people
[59:13] of God belongs to the truth that's why
[59:16] the devil can't get you is because he is
[59:18] the father of Lies but you are the
[59:21] children of
[59:23] truth that's why lies don't stop you
[59:26] that's why lies don't confuse you that's
[59:29] why lies don't back you up and take away
[59:31] your praise and steal your joy and
[59:34] silence your song Amen but you know who
[59:37] you are by the confidence of God hey
[59:40] well glory to God I come from truth
[59:43] that's why I'm free is because I am a
[59:46] friend of truth I belong to truth I love
[59:49] what the pr of God says he said the Holy
[59:51] Ghost dispensation come in and continued
[59:53] on and will continue on by by the
[59:56] administration of angels to the church
[59:58] truly but they're ordained spirits of
[1:00:01] God they're sent from God to carry the
[1:00:03] things out every man was a special
[1:00:05] calling amen back All Through the Ages
[1:00:08] amen angels has visit men amen it's not
[1:00:11] a worship of angels like Brigham Young
[1:00:13] and so forth I love this but an angel of
[1:00:16] God Amen will testify to the truth of
[1:00:19] God if the angel comes from God he will
[1:00:22] testify to the truth of God that's right
[1:00:25] amen and will declare God so when the
[1:00:28] angel of God comes into the church he's
[1:00:30] going to testify of God he's going to
[1:00:32] declare God it won't have some kind of
[1:00:35] mythical something that no one
[1:00:37] understands hey we ought to take a
[1:00:38] minute put our shouting shoes on that
[1:00:40] we're not under a confused denomination
[1:00:43] we're not under a confused Bishop we're
[1:00:45] not under a confused Pope amen we're
[1:00:47] under the leadership of the angel of God
[1:00:50] and when he comes in the church he don't
[1:00:52] bring confusion he rebukes confusion
[1:00:55] when he comes in the church he don't
[1:00:56] bring Str glory to God when he comes in
[1:01:00] the church here's what the prophet of
[1:01:01] God says it'll speak of Jesus Christ he
[1:01:03] will testify of Jesus Christ and will
[1:01:06] produce Jesus Christ to the
[1:01:09] people I am thoroughly convinced that
[1:01:12] the message of the hour came from the
[1:01:14] angel of God through the seventh angel
[1:01:17] see Jesus knew that he was born of the
[1:01:19] will of God he knew he was born to save
[1:01:22] man amen and Satan tried to defeat that
[1:01:25] purpose amen through Pontius pilot amen
[1:01:27] by the Judgment that he passed on the
[1:01:30] case of Jesus Christ listen friends when
[1:01:32] pil oh God when pilate passed judgment
[1:01:36] and said he is guilty amen crucify him
[1:01:38] amen listen he didn't realize that he
[1:01:41] was passing judgment upon him but the
[1:01:43] Judgment he was receiving was going to
[1:01:46] take the Judgment amen off of everyone
[1:01:49] who was a friend of Truth who was born
[1:01:51] of Truth who belonged to the truth well
[1:01:54] glory to God Amen you may feel down and
[1:01:56] out tonight amen but I think it's high
[1:01:58] time to remember who you are you are a
[1:02:00] part of Truth you belong to truth amen
[1:02:03] then say what the truth says and the
[1:02:06] truth says you're saved the truth says
[1:02:08] you're healed the truth says you're free
[1:02:10] the truth says you never done it in the
[1:02:12] first place the truth says you got the
[1:02:15] Holy Ghost the truth says greater is he
[1:02:17] that is in you than he that is in the
[1:02:20] world come on children of Truth come on
[1:02:22] Friends of Truth amen change your
[1:02:25] confession amen from the confession of
[1:02:27] pilate Amen to the confession of Jesus
[1:02:29] and say what he said about you one
[1:02:32] time now listen what the prodag God said
[1:02:35] it was at the time of the crucifixion of
[1:02:37] our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ he had
[1:02:39] done nothing as they could find in him
[1:02:41] and he had answered everything it was
[1:02:44] just the hour it had to be that way it
[1:02:47] was just the hour it had to be that way
[1:02:50] that's the reason this had to happen to
[1:02:52] the greatest man that ever lived on
[1:02:53] earth or ever could live amen the reason
[1:02:55] reason it happened this way is because
[1:02:58] it was time for it to happen see it must
[1:03:01] be thus and there was no way to escape
[1:03:04] it think about that that God in his
[1:03:07] economy had so fixed that moment that
[1:03:11] pilate would stand there and say I find
[1:03:13] no fault in him he would send him
[1:03:15] brother called it pilot scheme he would
[1:03:17] send him to Herod and then he would come
[1:03:19] back amen and say I still find no fault
[1:03:22] in this man but God had fixed it that
[1:03:24] way so that he would be standing there
[1:03:27] at that hour he said Jesus had come to
[1:03:29] the Earth exactly the way that God's
[1:03:32] word had predicted he would come he did
[1:03:35] just exactly what the word said he would
[1:03:37] do he lived the life just exactly and
[1:03:40] God made known or manifested amen the
[1:03:43] seed of that time now can I say this
[1:03:45] amen God's purpose in sending Jesus amen
[1:03:48] was for the purpose of bringing reality
[1:03:51] into
[1:03:52] Humanity brother said God is a god of
[1:03:54] reality is he not not don't just take a
[1:03:57] Creed don't just take a sensation take a
[1:03:59] reality take a real God something that
[1:04:02] God is amen a god of reality that gives
[1:04:06] you Assurance it gives you hope it gives
[1:04:09] you faith it gives you the spirit it
[1:04:11] gives you signs it gives you wonders it
[1:04:14] does in you just like it did in Christ
[1:04:17] because that was his purpose of coming
[1:04:20] Amen to bring God to man and made God
[1:04:23] and man one can I say this how many
[1:04:26] wants to know what your purpose is on
[1:04:27] the earth you want to know what your
[1:04:29] purpose is can I tell you what a prophet
[1:04:31] said he said we are born to believe the
[1:04:33] word of God we are born to believe Jesus
[1:04:37] Christ come on church we are born to
[1:04:40] believe the one who stood before pilot
[1:04:43] in the face of his death and said I've
[1:04:45] come for one purpose and that is the
[1:04:47] purpose of Truth and God has arranged
[1:04:49] things to send a message in this
[1:04:52] generation as an announcement that truth
[1:04:54] has returned in the middle of an age of
[1:04:57] deception can I say this to you we are
[1:05:00] born to believe the message can I say
[1:05:02] this there's something in you and can I
[1:05:05] say this what's in you says the message
[1:05:07] is
[1:05:08] real that's why you're believing what
[1:05:11] you're believing because things around
[1:05:13] you will question it things around you
[1:05:15] amen will make you wonder but if there
[1:05:17] is a gene seed of God on the inside of
[1:05:20] your soul then there is something in you
[1:05:23] that causes your soul to agree with this
[1:05:26] word I say thank God we have returned to
[1:05:29] a Vindicated definition of what the
[1:05:32] message of the hour is can I say this
[1:05:34] it's God's promise of this hour anybody
[1:05:38] anybody ever heard the term message of
[1:05:39] the hour sure you have amen can I tell
[1:05:42] you what a prophet said it is he said
[1:05:44] it's God's promise for the hour you're
[1:05:45] living in so don't ever wonder no more
[1:05:48] amen what is the message don't ever
[1:05:50] wonder no more amen I wish I could
[1:05:52] figure out the message I have just told
[1:05:55] you what the angel of God said to a
[1:05:57] prophet the message of the hour is God's
[1:06:00] promise of the hour you're living in can
[1:06:02] I say this amen that definition did not
[1:06:04] come out of Bob Jones University that
[1:06:07] definition amen did not come out of a
[1:06:09] commentary amen but according to a
[1:06:11] prophet he said sister Joyce I've got to
[1:06:13] stay under the anointing Amen to find
[1:06:17] what the message of the hour is so he
[1:06:19] was living under the anointing and
[1:06:22] coming to the pullit and telling the
[1:06:24] church this is what the message is it's
[1:06:28] not what it was and it's not what it's
[1:06:30] going to be he said here's what the
[1:06:32] message is that Jesus Christ is truly
[1:06:35] risen from the
[1:06:37] dead glory to God now can I just preach
[1:06:39] here for a minute because the Bible said
[1:06:42] amen that the Yoke shall be destroyed
[1:06:44] amen because of the anointing a prophet
[1:06:47] of God said I stay under the anointing
[1:06:50] Amen to find out what the message is so
[1:06:53] when he comes out amen he's preaching
[1:06:55] under the anointing and that anointing
[1:06:58] is a yoke destroy an anointing in other
[1:07:01] words when that anointing begins to move
[1:07:03] in a church it begins to bring an
[1:07:06] opportunity among the people Amen to
[1:07:09] receive the truth or to reject the truth
[1:07:11] and if you reject the truth you will
[1:07:13] leave the same way you came in worse but
[1:07:16] if you will receive the truth you will
[1:07:18] not leave here like you came H glory to
[1:07:21] God I feel like shouting on that one we
[1:07:24] don't have to leave the same way we came
[1:07:26] we don't have to come in bad and leave
[1:07:28] worse we don't have to come in down and
[1:07:30] leave lower amen there is a message of
[1:07:33] the king that has come in the camp and
[1:07:35] it's a message of Deliverance it's a
[1:07:37] message of Mercy it's a message of Grace
[1:07:40] it's a message of faith and if you can
[1:07:42] receive it as the truth it'll destroy
[1:07:44] the Yoke over your life it'll destroy
[1:07:46] the Yol over your home and the presence
[1:07:48] of God will'll walk back in that home
[1:07:51] and will identify itself as the token of
[1:07:54] God
[1:07:56] but I feel like shouting tonight hey I
[1:07:58] ain't going to leave here like I came I
[1:08:00] ain't going to leave here like I came
[1:08:01] and neither are
[1:08:03] you will you sing that song you ain't
[1:08:05] going to leave here like you came in
[1:08:07] Jesus
[1:08:10] name brother God said it he said the
[1:08:12] message of the hour is repent and turn
[1:08:15] back again to the faith of the father
[1:08:18] turn back again to the faith of the one
[1:08:21] you was begotten of turn back again to
[1:08:24] the faith of the one you belong to turn

[1:09:20] homeless I have a father who died on the
[1:09:22] cross at Calvary to give me a home in

[1:14:30] Rapture by coma denominational ideas we
[1:14:33] have been given a wheat seed message and
[1:14:36] it's the truth and if we're going to
[1:14:38] take a rapture we got to get into it and
[1:14:40] we got to get beneath it brother B said
[1:14:42] like this the Rapture is a revelation to
[1:14:44] her he said see the bride of Christ will
[1:14:47] be waiting amen for the Rapture
[1:14:49] Revelation can I say this we have
[1:14:52] it now you say this brother Andrew yes

[1:14:58] works it's rapturing Grace and rapturing
[1:15:02] Faith you will not work your way in this
[1:15:05] Rapture you will not shout your way in
[1:15:07] this Rapture you will not dance your way

[1:15:11] the way but that's not the only way
[1:15:12] you're going to get there are you
[1:15:14] hearing me the way you will get in this
[1:15:16] Rapture is the same way you come back
[1:15:18] into your complete identification as a
[1:15:20] son of Truth for by grace are ye saved
[1:15:24] amen through faith it is not of
[1:15:26] yourselves amen it is the gift of God I
[1:15:29] truly believe before the church can have
[1:15:31] the Rapture somebody say it's got to
[1:15:33] have it's got to have rapturing faith
[1:15:36] then can I say this what God requires
[1:15:39] amen God must provide what God requires
[1:15:43] God must provide brother if God is
[1:15:45] requiring something brother Travis than
[1:15:48] God has got to provide it I use this
[1:15:50] example amen down the camp it's okay to
[1:15:52] use it here amen I used on brother Ron
[1:15:55] use on you Matt amen amen if I call Matt
[1:15:57] up and I say now Matt let's go to

[1:16:08] got a have you got money to buy a hotel
[1:16:10] can you buy me some tags and buy me some
[1:16:12] tickets and buy some food amen before
[1:16:14] long Matt's going to say what in the
[1:16:15] world have I been invited on Amen I
[1:16:17] thought I was invited to go somewhere
[1:16:19] amen and I called Matt and I said Matt
[1:16:21] it's a gift I want to take it but then I
[1:16:23] show up and he's got to provide
[1:16:25] everything to get us there listen amen
[1:16:27] that's unfair he is no longer going as a
[1:16:30] gift he's trying to work his way on the
[1:16:33] trip are you hearing me amen and God
[1:16:35] cannot require rapturing faith and then
[1:16:38] say go pray 10 times a day go fast 10
[1:16:40] times today join this church do this no
[1:16:43] if God requires it amen when God invites
[1:16:46] you on the trip it's already paid for
[1:16:49] and Church of the Living God we ain't
[1:16:51] trying to work up enough Grace we ain't
[1:16:53] trying to work up enough faith Ben God
[1:16:55] invited us in this Rapture he invited us
[1:16:58] to be a part of the church of living God
[1:17:00] listen whatever we have need of he is
[1:17:03] the inexhaustible Fountain he has the
[1:17:05] unsearchable riches all we got to do is
[1:17:08] drink in and push out everything we have
[1:17:11] need of is in this
[1:17:14] message now the pr of God makes it very
[1:17:16] beautiful right down the road from here
[1:17:17] in Jonesburg Arkansas he says now we're
[1:17:19] able to pull the pages back but we're
[1:17:22] not able to open the
[1:17:23] word Thou Art the only one who can take
[1:17:27] this word and th art the only one that's
[1:17:29] worthy to open the word the lamb that
[1:17:31] was slain from the foundation of the
[1:17:33] world oh Lamb of God oh Lamb of God come
[1:17:38] into our midst tonight in the power of
[1:17:40] thy resurrection and give us rapturing
[1:17:44] Faith now I'm not a crazy man I'm a
[1:17:47] message preacher that studies the
[1:17:48] message and nowhere in there did Brother
[1:17:50] BR say these words let Miracles be done
[1:17:53] tonight and give rapturing faith
[1:17:55] rapturing Faith does not come for
[1:17:57] miracles they had miracles in Pentecost
[1:18:01] rapturing faith comes from the opening
[1:18:03] of the word see and the opening of the
[1:18:06] word is what moves this bride from a lay
[1:18:08] out ofan age into a bride age now can I
[1:18:12] say what the pr of God said all the way
[1:18:14] back in 1954 he's already talking about
[1:18:17] how many you heard the term Bri age
[1:18:20] honestly let me see your hands you've
[1:18:21] heard it right amen amen so there's no
[1:18:23] confusion in
[1:18:25] 1954 he does not term at Bri age till 65
[1:18:29] but in 1954 he's already talking about
[1:18:32] it he said now we're moving right on
[1:18:34] into another great age see coming for
[1:18:37] the Rapture of the church and in this
[1:18:39] we're living in the time of the
[1:18:41] restoration of the gifts so we're living
[1:18:43] in the time of the restoration of the
[1:18:45] gifts but see it stumbled many big fine
[1:18:47] churches it sent the Nazarene backwards
[1:18:50] it made Fanatics out of a lot of
[1:18:51] Pentecost but just the same God is
[1:18:54] moving right on Amen bringing in
[1:18:57] rapturing faith for his church so God
[1:19:01] was not allowing what was stumbling one
[1:19:03] generation to hinder the Next Generation
[1:19:06] but because God is rich in Mercy he
[1:19:08] provided a way Amen to move on from The
[1:19:11] Stumbling and to move into the reality
[1:19:14] can I say this I love how brother B says
[1:19:16] this he said one place he says we got to
[1:19:18] have rapturing faith I love what he says
[1:19:20] but don't worry it'll be there can we
[1:19:23] relax Our Minds tonight we're going to

[1:22:47] Pilate and said it is the truth is the
[1:22:50] same Jesus in this building tonight in
[1:22:52] the form of his word by the baptism of
[1:22:55] the Holy Ghost and it's telling you Vana
[1:22:57] it's the truth it's the truth church I
[1:23:00] don't care what it looks like I don't
[1:23:01] care what it feels like I don't care
[1:23:03] what the devil says it's the truth and
[1:23:06] somebody ought to testify it's the
[1:23:08] truth I've already got rapturing faith
[1:23:11] I've already got rapturing Grace I've
[1:23:13] already got the Holy Ghost the word's
[1:23:16] already in my soul it's the truth it's
[1:23:19] the truth it's the truth it's the truth
[1:23:23] I wish I could shout it on the top of
[1:23:24] the roof tonight it's the truth Mark the
[1:23:27] message of the hour is the
[1:23:30] truth get in
[1:23:33] it get beneath it it's the truth now
[1:23:38] Revelation 10 says it very beautiful
[1:23:40] ream picks this up and this is the sign
[1:23:42] of the end sir he said the other Angels
[1:23:44] was Messengers they were men of the
[1:23:46] Earth but this angel said to the angel
[1:23:50] of the Church of Leota now watch this
[1:23:53] one didn't come from the Earth
[1:23:55] he come down from heaven see because the
[1:24:00] mystery is all finished when the mystery
[1:24:04] is finished the angel said time shall be
[1:24:06] no more then seven Thunders thr out
[1:24:08] their voices what if it is something to
[1:24:11] let us know how to enter into the
[1:24:15] rapturing
[1:24:16] faith see accepting the Vindicated word
[1:24:21] is God's provided way to bring the
[1:24:23] believer in the rapturing
[1:24:26] faith can I say this
[1:24:31] accepting what God has revealed and
[1:24:33] opened in your generation is the path to
[1:24:37] fulfill the promise of the hour you're
[1:24:39] living in now if we could look at
[1:24:42] Revelation 101 and remember what the
[1:24:44] prophet of God said he said we're not
[1:24:46] talking about the message we're getting
[1:24:48] in it Brother David you've been around
[1:24:50] for a while you've been in some of those
[1:24:52] meetings where all they do is talk about
[1:24:53] the message
[1:24:55] come on some of you Elders know what I'm
[1:24:57] talking about two hours they just stand
[1:24:59] there and talk about it and talk about
[1:25:00] it and talk about
[1:25:02] it hello and debate it and compare it
[1:25:05] and compare this quo with that quo amen
[1:25:07] and all they're doing is talking about
[1:25:10] it and their young people's waiting on
[1:25:12] them to get done so they can go
[1:25:13] somewhere and have some
[1:25:15] fun cuz I don't think this quote goes
[1:25:17] with that quote and I don't think this
[1:25:19] idea lines with that idea and what do
[1:25:20] you think
[1:25:23] about so they're sitting around the
[1:25:25] message comparing it but that's not what
[1:25:27] the proud of God said he said we're to
[1:25:29] get in it we are to get beneath it now
[1:25:33] Revelation 10:1 says I saw another
[1:25:36] Mighty Angel come down from heaven cloth
[1:25:40] with a cloud now a rainbow was upon his
[1:25:43] head and his face as it were the Sun and
[1:25:46] his feet as pillars of fire do you know
[1:25:48] there's people that actually claim to
[1:25:49] believe this message that say the cloud
[1:25:51] is
[1:25:52] irrelevant they actually say the cloud
[1:25:54] is irrelevant they say things like well
[1:25:56] we really don't even need the cloud well
[1:25:59] okay tear out Revelation 10:1 and throw
[1:26:01] it away then but if you do that oh God I
[1:26:05] feel that Spirit if you do that you've
[1:26:07] just removed William brandom from being
[1:26:09] a word
[1:26:11] Prophet because a word Prophet has to
[1:26:14] testify of the whole truth and nothing
[1:26:17] but the truth and from Genesis to
[1:26:20] Revelation he said everything is the
[1:26:23] truth see that's why the devil hates
[1:26:25] this church is we don't have to tear out
[1:26:27] one scripture to have a good
[1:26:29] meeting we don't have to get up here
[1:26:31] behind the pull pit and turn a page and
[1:26:33] move a page and remove a quote to have
[1:26:36] church we can say every scripture we can
[1:26:38] read every quote we can shout on
[1:26:40] everything we can shout on every promise
[1:26:43] we can take correction we can take
[1:26:45] blessings we can take anointing we can
[1:26:47] take Revelation because we belong to
[1:26:52] truth so they say well this is not very
[1:26:54] important but I want to say this if you
[1:26:56] can give me that first picture Amen in
[1:26:58] 1963 amen this appeared in the skies it
[1:27:02] showed up above the Earth it did not
[1:27:06] come from the earth it it came from the
[1:27:09] heavens now listen they had this picture
[1:27:12] and there was men looking at it and they
[1:27:14] were seeing Angels they were seeing
[1:27:16] prophets they were seeing all kinds of
[1:27:18] figures but in 1965 and it is the rising
[1:27:22] of the Sun the pro God said well if
[1:27:25] you'll turn the picture like this and
[1:27:27] look and he turns the picture and he
[1:27:30] says you can probably see it from the
[1:27:32] audience it's
[1:27:35] Christ you can turn the picture come on
[1:27:39] Church you know what I love about that
[1:27:41] is he didn't just say I can see it from
[1:27:43] the pull pit he said but you can see it
[1:27:45] from the audience you know what that
[1:27:46] tells me the youngest of our babies can
[1:27:49] see it the oldest of our elders can see
[1:27:51] it it ain't just a bunch of preachers
[1:27:53] seeing it it ain't just a bunch of Decon
[1:27:55] sent amen but every word born believer
[1:27:58] Who belongs to truth and is a friend of
[1:28:01] Truth can see it is no one else but the
[1:28:05] Lord Jesus Christ descending into this
[1:28:08] generation as the father of
[1:28:11] light glory to God hallelujah amen I
[1:28:15] feel like shouting out of the building
[1:28:16] on that one amen our youngest the
[1:28:18] children can see it our youngest the
[1:28:20] babies can see it amen what can they see
[1:28:23] they don't see a man man they see Jesus
[1:28:25] Christ they don't see a prophet they see
[1:28:28] the face of the son of man who is coming
[1:28:30] in glory and clouds and great power and
[1:28:33] it's going to change our
[1:28:35] bodies well somebody put your shouting

[1:31:58] Truth
[1:32:00] this hallelujah it's the truth Mark it's
[1:32:04] the truth listen what a prophet of God
[1:32:06] said he said with a white you see the
[1:32:08] dark in his face his beard his eyes
[1:32:10] notice from him comes this light shining
[1:32:12] on the right hand side to which he's
[1:32:15] looking to ready for this and on the
[1:32:19] cross that's where he looked to the
[1:32:23] right
[1:32:24] where he pardoned The
[1:32:27] Sinner Brother David Paul I get on that
[1:32:30] page when he looked to the right he
[1:32:32] parred in the center come on church he
[1:32:35] was not looking to the left he was not
[1:32:37] looking above him he was looking for the
[1:32:39] people come on church he knew that a
[1:32:43] prophet of God was going to walk in this
[1:32:46] generation and preach a sermon called
[1:32:48] what shall I do with this Jesus called
[1:32:50] Christ and say we're in another pilot
[1:32:53] Hall when he hung there in Arizona he
[1:32:55] knew that was going to happen but he
[1:32:57] also knew he was going to fix it so much
[1:33:00] that when he hung on the cross and he
[1:33:02] looked to the right he was going to
[1:33:03] pardon the people who would raise their
[1:33:05] hand on Wednesday April the 3D and say
[1:33:08] it's the truth
[1:33:10] Lord I believe it Lord I believe the
[1:33:13] message I believe it above my feelings I
[1:33:16] believe it above my
[1:33:19] problems it's the
[1:33:22] truth now come on brother said when he
[1:33:25] turned to the right he pardoned the
[1:33:29] center he said but in the light of
[1:33:33] Resurrection in the light of his
[1:33:36] resurrection he says we still go forth
[1:33:41] in his
[1:33:43] name now I want to close on this point
[1:33:48] so here what you see there comes down
[1:33:52] but in Revelation 10 to and he had in
[1:33:55] his hand a little book
[1:33:59] closed is that what your Bible
[1:34:02] says he had in his hand a little book
[1:34:06] open and he set his right foot upon the
[1:34:09] sea and his left foot on the earth now
[1:34:12] Revelation 5 that book was closed
[1:34:14] Brother David but in Revelation 10 that
[1:34:17] book was open and the prodag God said he
[1:34:19] cried with a loud voice as when a Lon
[1:34:21] Roth and when he had cried s seven
[1:34:24] Thunders uttered their voices and when
[1:34:26] the seven Thunders had uttered their
[1:34:28] voices I was about to
[1:34:31] write but I Heard a Voice from Heaven
[1:34:33] saying unto
[1:34:36] me seal up those things which the seven
[1:34:40] Thunders uttered and write them not now
[1:34:43] people say well the seven Thunders are
[1:34:45] still closed okay I'll go with you on
[1:34:47] that so you're a bound
[1:34:50] Church don't tell me the seven Thunders
[1:34:52] are closed and got freedom because
[1:34:55] whatever was in those seven Thunders
[1:34:58] come on Amen if you get time this week
[1:35:00] if you I wish had time to go through all
[1:35:02] of it but let me say it like this the
[1:35:04] Book of Revelation is a book of symbols
[1:35:06] right from the first chapter to the 22nd
[1:35:08] chapter it's a book of symbols you
[1:35:10] constantly are reading symbol symbol
[1:35:12] symbol symbol symbol listen and as long
[1:35:14] as it's in symbol form any old body can
[1:35:16] walk up here and say well this is that
[1:35:18] symbol and that's that symbol and that's
[1:35:21] that symbol and you know what happens
[1:35:23] amen it brings a confusion because
[1:35:25] somebody else walks up and says no this
[1:35:27] is that symbol and that's that symbol oh
[1:35:29] I'm getting into it now and that's that
[1:35:31] symbol amen but you know what a prophet
[1:35:33] of God did he cleaned up the y'all
[1:35:35] remember he cleaned up the air in the
[1:35:38] church and revealed the symbols so we're
[1:35:41] no longer reading symbols we're reading
[1:35:43] the reality of those symbols come on
[1:35:46] church I'm no longer reading just saying
[1:35:48] a lamb and Thunders and
[1:35:52] trumpets come on church when he comes
[1:35:54] down confusion goes
[1:35:57] out when the seventh angel comes down
[1:36:00] with the open book receed from the
[1:36:02] mighty Angel confusion goes out now I
[1:36:04] believe that through those seven
[1:36:05] Thunders we'll be revealed in the last
[1:36:07] days in order to get the bride together
[1:36:08] for rapturing Faith there's something we
[1:36:11] got to step further we can't have enough
[1:36:13] faith for Divine Healing hardly we got
[1:36:15] to have enough Faith to be changed in a
[1:36:17] moment and be swept out of this Earth
[1:36:18] and we'll find after a while the Lord
[1:36:20] will and find where it's written we
[1:36:23] don't know where at yet but my opinion
[1:36:26] they'll be revealed right
[1:36:28] away I love brother BR I love brother BR
[1:36:31] English and when it
[1:36:36] do look at somebody saying when it
[1:36:40] do a joke when it
[1:36:43] do it'll give faith for that rapturing
[1:36:47] Grace for that church to move out see we
[1:36:50] just move through everything we know of
[1:36:52] through all that this ens ation we've
[1:36:54] watched everything we've seen the
[1:36:56] Mysteries we've seen the appearing of
[1:36:58] the great grren together the bride in
[1:36:59] the last days but yet there's something
[1:37:01] in there we just can't lighten oursel
[1:37:03] with there's something other but I
[1:37:05] imagine when them Mysteries begins to
[1:37:06] come forth God said hold it back now
[1:37:09] wait a minute I'll reveal it in that day
[1:37:11] don't Rite it at all John cause they'll
[1:37:13] stagger over it just let it go but I'll
[1:37:16] reveal it in that day when it has need
[1:37:19] to be
[1:37:20] done can I say this you are the need
[1:37:23] need to reveal the seven Thunders you
[1:37:26] are the need to reveal the symbols of
[1:37:29] the Book of Revelation Church of the
[1:37:31] Living God you are the need to release
[1:37:34] the seventh seal you are the need to
[1:37:37] identify the third pull you are the need
[1:37:39] to identify the Lamb of God in the
[1:37:41] opening of the
[1:37:43] word you are the
[1:37:46] need now how's it going to come in the
[1:37:49] days of the voice of the seventh angel
[1:37:52] when he shall begin to sound I'm tying
[1:37:55] it together right here the mystery of
[1:37:58] God should be finished as he had
[1:38:00] declared to his servants the prophets
[1:38:02] ready for this when he shall begin to
[1:38:06] sound can I say it like this or when he
[1:38:09] shall begin to disclose one's
[1:38:13] mind when he shall begin to present by
[1:38:17] speaking the messenger of Malachi 4
[1:38:19] Revelation 10:7 is going to do two
[1:38:21] things one according to Malachi 4 he is
[1:38:23] going to turn the hearts of the children
[1:38:25] to the fathers to the truth and two he
[1:38:29] will reveal the Mysteries now young
[1:38:31] people can I preach you for a second CU
[1:38:33] I know what the devil says the devil
[1:38:35] says no they just need a Bible

[1:38:51] are further down the road than 50 year
[1:38:53] old
[1:38:55] theologians come on church that's why
[1:38:58] you got to get in the message and get
[1:39:00] beneath it and just say what a prophet
[1:39:02] said and when you say what a prophet
[1:39:04] said it rebukes confusion and here's
[1:39:06] what he said the mysteries of the seven
[1:39:08] thunders in Revelation 10 which are the
[1:39:11] revelations contained in the Seven Seals
[1:39:15] so you got a seven seal book so go get
[1:39:18] in that seven seal book and get beneath
[1:39:21] that seven seal book and rebuke every
[1:39:24] devil of confusion and receive the
