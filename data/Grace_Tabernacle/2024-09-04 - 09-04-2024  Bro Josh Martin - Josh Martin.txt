him tonight amen if you have your Bibles let's open our scriptures to Matthew 26 and 26 like to say it's an honor to be here this evening appreciate the invite by our brother Matt to to be ministering I pray something could be said to be a blessing it's good to have my wife Loretta with me and my my two kiddos Ethan and Brielle also my sister-in-law Tina uh she's traveling with us and so we appreciate them them being in service tonight with us amen Matthew 26 and 26 the Bible would say as they were eating Jesus Took bread and blessed it and break it and gave it to the disciples and said take eat this is my body and he took the cup and gave thanks and gave it to them saying drink ye all of it it for this is my blood of the new testament which is shed for many for the remission of sins amen can we bow our heads this evening dear gracious Heavenly Father Lord how we how we thank you for your grace Lord and your mercy God thank you for uh coming Among Us already Lord as we've sang songs father of worship Lord and we feel your presence come near us today Father we ask that you would be in this part of the service Lord we ask that you would anoint your word God lord you know the needs and the desires of the hearts father only you can meet them Father God As I Lay myself aside and I ask that you would anoint me Father speak through these lips of clay Lord and speak to the hearts God lord I ask that you would anoint the congregation father may they also come under the same inspiration Lord and receive what you have for us tonight we ask these things in your precious name amen you may be seated this evening uh my title tonight would be a positive token to something really simple but I pray it can it can bless each and every one of us say amen but brother Brandon would tell us that we live off of dead substance you know what if we if we eat something it had to die before you can eat a hamburger the cow had to die you know before you can eat before you can eat bacon for breakfast the pig had to die and he would say even for your vegetarians you know he says the vegetable had to Die the the fruit had to die or the bacteria of the milk it had to die so whatever we live off of naturally had to die in order for us to live and he would tell us the same thing spiritually in order for us to be alive spiritually something had to die and we would see through the Old Testament that they would come to the Tabernacle and would slay a lamb and the blood of that lamb would pour over them and it would bring a forgiveness of their sins you know but there was no separation from their sin just a forgiveness it was a cycle they would come to the Tabernacle for maybe telling a lie or for having a a bad thought or being jealous or a gossiping Spirit whatever it would be they would say Lord forgive me the blood would pour on them but they would leave that with that sin still connected with them there was no remission under the blood of bulls and goats there was they were under a cycle every year they' come and slay a lamb for the same sin slay a lamb for the same sin you know the Bible would tell us in Hebrews 10:1 for the law having a shadow of good things to come not the very image of the things can never with those sacrifices which they offered year by year can continually make the comers there unto perfect so so when the blood of Christ would come it would not just forgive you but it would bring a remission and the word remission means separated released from prison or bondage and so the blood of Christ would break the cycle where you wouldn't just come on a on a on a Wednesday night saying God forgive me for this next Wednesday God forgive me for this a year from now you're struggling with the same thing it was a remission a separation of uh from the very nature that the blood of bulls and goats could not take away from you and I like how the Bible would tell under the blood of bulls and goats there's a remembrance made for sin every year but under the blood of Christ the Bible would say this because that the worshippers once purged should have no more conscience of sin so under the Old Testament there was a remembrance of sin the conscience the desire of sin was there but under the blood of Christ not a cycle but once purged there was no more desire no more conscience of sin so I believe leing today not in a cycle but we're living in a liberty that the blood of Christ has brought us but you see it wasn't the literal blood of Jesus but it was the life of the blood that would that's what would bring the remission cuz if you don't get the life of the blood you're in the same cycle we can say we got the blood we got the blood but there's a life behind the blood there's a life that can come and bring remission and brother Brandon would tell us what would he do if he had two drops of the blood of Jesus you know and he would say I would walk so careful with it if I had it in a cup I would walk so careful so reverently that I would not spill those drops of blood but he says there's more something more important in front of me than the literal blood of Jesus it's the purchase of the blood of Jesus so we don't got the literal blood of Jesus today but we've got the purchased product we've up the life of the blood not the chemical there's a life that has brought us out of the negative and taken us into a positive because brother brandom you know would would tell us what what what what what did the blood do he would say when the blood of Christ the blood cell was broke he says it would release God and so the Cru the cross is more than a crucifix the blood is more than a chemical but it was releasing of deity to come inside of humanity that were in cycles that would come inside of humanity that could not get past the sin nature and would release a nature would release God inside of a young person inside of a marriage inside of a daddy and bring a remission and so the blood of Christ would bring more than a forgiveness the Bible would tell us in Hebrews 10:1 17 and their sins and iniquities will I remember no more I'm not just going to forgive you but when I look at you you're separated from the sins that you would come in oh Hallelujah so when God looks at a young person he don't see Cycles when God looks at a young person he don't see failures he don't see past mistakes he sees a remission he sees a separation not a cycle but a separation oh Hallelujah brother Brandon would say when he looks at you all he hears is your voice but he sees or but he sees your representation which is the blood of Christ so when God looks at you all he sees is his blood you know brother the Brandon would say you'll never be perfect in my sight and I'll never be perfect in your sight but he says what about God's sight oh my you may see mistakes you may see failures you may see flaws but what does God see when God looks at your brother he sees the blood he don't see complexes and I'm so thankful cuz when God looks at me there's plenty of faults he can point to but he don't see the faults he don't see the mistakes he sees the blood and you may feel like you're in a cycle tonight but there's a blood this evening that has brought a remission where when God looks at you he sees the blood of Christ oh Hallelujah you know the Bible would tell us in Romans for the remission of sins that are passed you know so that that's many things or you know that's many sins that the Bible's talking about for the remission of sins that are passed because that's many many people struggle with things that they used to do right I used to do this the the the Devil comes with condemnation says you know what you did yesterday you know what you did 20 years ago and they can't get past the condemnation so the blood did not just bring a remission of sins today or of tomorrow but he brought a remission of the sins of yesterday as well where we can live good up in the morning and know what we used to do but it's separated from me I don't believe that condemnation has to plague a young young young person or a marriage or a mama or a daddy it don't matter what you used to do there's a remission of the very sins that you used to commit and brother Brandon will tell us consider this since it is the blood of God it is the perfect blood and if the perfect blood is loosening us or bringing a remission from the power and bondage and defilement of sin then the loosening is perfect and complete there was now no more condemnation he would say there it is he gave his day G he gave us the blood and the blood has loosed us there was now no condemnation how can there be there was nothing to be condemned for because the blood has loosed us we are free Guiltless don't listen to the man listen to the word you are loosed by the blood I like how he puts it don't listen to the man listen to the word and I say don't listen to condemnation listen to the word you are loosed by the blood if it's a perfect blood that means it's a perfect loosening that means it's completely separated where God don't even say it anymore you remember the story brother Brandon would tell of the young lady that was a young girl that was having a tea party and she had a daddy that was religious y'all remember the story and brother Brandon would tell us that when she would get her friends to come over he would she would get her daddy and would say go up in the attic take his Bible away and give him a book of geography you remember that says stay up here Daddy don't embarrass me don't go and Shout him don't go and rejoicing I'm going to come down and have this party and brother Brandon would tell us as she was having that tea party he says all of a sudden the chandelier would begin to bounce he would start to Rejoice up there and the girl would run upstairs and would say daddy why why are you so excited I took your Bible away and he would say well I'm looking in this in this book that you given me and it tells me that the deepest part of the ocean the the humans has never found it yet and I thought if they can't find the deepest part of the ocean what about God see a forgetfulness if they can't find the bottom of it I can never find the bottom of God's forgetfulness and I say that's where we stand today not just forgiven but a separation but a remission where when God looks at you he does not see it oh you never committed a sin in the first place not just forgiven but Justified Sanctified filled with the life of the blood where the very conscience of sin has been taken away Hallelujah and I believe tonight if there's a young person an adult that are strugling with the life of sin there's a remission that the life of the blood can bring you this evening where you can leave this place a different a different human being the very conscience of the sin can be dealt with oh hallelujah it's a perfect blood bringing a perfect loosening so that's why we're no longer known by our own nature we're not the man or the woman we used to be but there's a separation oh Hallelujah and so brother the Brandon would tell us that God would show his longsuffering and his kindness to pharaoh and the people of Egypt there in the token messages he preaches while five or six token messages and he would tell us that the God was showing his kindness and longsuffering to Pharaoh but they would not heed to the message and it's so incredible how brother Brandon put it he says he sent them a prophet he sent them signs he sent them the pillar of fire and behind all of these signs was a message and the message was let my people people go and I like how brother Brandon would put it he says they would not repent and they ignored all of his signs his Prophet his message and now God is making a separation he says he got fed up with him and what was the separation it was the token and so the token was to separate them from the Judgment that was coming upon the city cuz we would see that there would there would be the the the death angel would be coming through the land right and would be striking homes going inside of this home take him this firstborn going into that home take him that firstborn but mommy and daddy under the blood could have an assurance that there was a separation from the from the Judgment that was coming upon the city and I don't believe that the plagues that were in Egypt was for the Israelites it was for the Egyptians oh come on now neither is the Judgment that is upon the Earth today for your minds for your body for your marriages for your for for your conscience condemnation is a judgment upon the Earth but it's not for you oh you may say I'm fighting in my mind yes you're inlay judgments are upon the Earth today but there is a separation under a token that can that can take you out of the the complexes that can take you out of the the the divorc spirit that tries to come against the home there's a there's a token that can separate you from the judgments that are upon the Earth today oh you see that the the Judgment was not for the for the Israelites it was for the Egyptians and the Bible would tell us that we're living in a day where there's 200,000,000 demons that has been released you know that there's spear that there's fear that is gripping the world today you know while we're living in a peace there's fear that is walking out on the streets today you see they're a part of the Judgment but you have been separated from it but you know the Brandon would tell us that they were to apply the blood and they were in Egypt would apply the blood with hisp right and he would say they would that hisp wasn't something special it was a common weed that was among all the Palestine and he would say that that HP is a type of your faith and could you imagine being Pharaoh there in his home realizing that there's prophecy being fulfilled the judgment is going through the homes going through the streets he heard this one maybe heard a cry of this one over here their daughter just died or their son just died he knew that judgment was coming to his home and could you imagine just thinking as a father what can I do to stop this judgment maybe I can do this maybe I can do that but he did not know that right among him was a common weed and a blood that can separate him from the Judgment every living in a day where they think a new president is going to help maybe PR some more money will help maybe some more politicians will help here but they fa to realize that right among them now is a common faith that has been restored that we can apply the token and it separates us from the Judgment the anxieties the fears the complexes oh Hallelujah divorcement that are coming against the hope your your your marriage does not have to end in the divorce come on now you don't got to live in a home where you can't feel a freedom but there's a separation that a separating us from the from the Judgment that is upon the Earth today oh Hallelujah while the world is looking for something big to bring a certainty there's something right Among Us that is that that that faith has been restored and it's bringing a separation oh my but you see brother Brandon would preach the token and would tell us that the token is the is the evidence that the price has been paid right he would talk about a train car or if you're going to get on on a bus or get on a get on an airplane you don't bring your money to the to your Gates but you got to have a ticket right and he would say the ticket is the token whenever you go when you fly I I just went to Czech Republic here about a month and a half ago or so and whenever I got to the airport I didn't bring my my my cash and would say hey I W to go to I need to get to Amsterdam and from Amsterdam I need to get over there to to Prague Czech Republic I couldn't give him my money the money purchased what months ago but now I am identifying myself with what my money had already purchased my money did no good at that point but that money had purchased me something oh you can be saying we got the blood we got the blood we got the blood but the blood has done something for you come on now the blood has purchased something that has brought a separation I could not come to the to the ticket counter and say here here's my $1,200 I need to get the truck Republic they wouldn't accept it no I got to be identified I got to be identified with what the purchase had bought for me that that day and you would see that when I get there I I would not go to security IID didn't check in my bags but first I had to be identified first then once I got identified got the ticket got the token now I am eligible to check in my bag I'm eligible to go through security I'm eligible to go through the Customs it don't matter the complications that are ahead of me I'm eligible to go through them because of the token and you're not eligible to see the supernatural until you get the token but once you get the token the all of Heaven has been opened up to you where it don't matter if it's a rebellious teenager you're the supernatural has been given to you and you're eligible for it oh hallelujah we're eligible for it you see whenever you get the token it's God saying here's the scepter you've got whatever you have need of you speak the word not me speaking the word you're speaking the word and I will honor that word oh Hallelujah but but you know that I I got a complex of flying that I always get nervous at security and I feel like the security guys just hate me you'll ever feel that way I just I get to security and I think my goodness quit laughing I know what you're thinking you know you get to you get there and you think my goodness they're going to turn me around but there's nothing they can do to turn me around but there are some things they can do you I've lost my luggage too many times and so I like to take a carryon back right you can take it with you on into the plane you can put it under your seat or put it up on the on on the top of the thing you know and you see but but but in that carry-on back there were some items that can't go through security right sometimes I forget about my big shampoo or my body washer or maybe a razor or something and and it's always depressing whenever you make it through security you're standing there you're waiting on your bag and I've even got that pre-check thing I don't got to take my shoes off I I don't got to take my belt off I don't got to take my computer out of my back all I got to do is walk through but it's always depressing standing there you see your bag come through the scanner it stops and it slides over and you're like oh man but you see they can't turn me around but they can do something they can take some items out of my bag that cannot go onto the flight yeah oh Hallelujah and you know what they say who has this bag here it's mine okay is okay if I open it yeah you can open okay why do we got oh this here this can't get on board what do you want me to do with it you want to take it back to your car or do you want me to throw it away I said Lord no I ain't going back I've come too far throw it away and so God has given the devil permission he can't take you away he can't turn you around but there are some things that the devil is allowed to knock off of you maybe that bitterness it can't make a Rapture maybe that gossip can't make a Rapture the devil can't turn you around but he can knock some things off of you and you know what I say we've come too far to be turned around because of little sins we've come too far to be turned around because of bitterness we've come too far to be turned around we've gotten something in this generation that has given us a ticket for blast off oh hallelujah we're in the countdown not at the beginning not in the middle we're at the end time we're it's blast off it's time to step into our body change this ain't time to turn around and give up and lay down and embrace things of the world it's time to throw them away and say let me get on the plane let me get in this Rapture I ain't turning around throw it out how don't want that shampoo throw it out throw it away throw that razor I know it cost me something but throw it out you know bitterness cost you more to keep than throw it away oh I'm preaching now it cost you more it eats you up it eats you up I say let's throw it out oh it ain't time to go back where we started throw it out oh Hallelujah you see it's the token that identifies you but the brand say there you are the blood the blood he says the token not the blood chemistry but the token the Holy Ghost the life of the blood that comes what does that life do it comes and confirms what the token has been purchased for the token confirms what the blood has bought for you the blood purchased for Redemption the token is the evidence of it the blood he was wounded for our transgressions he was bruised for our iniquities the chastisement of our peace was upon him with the stripes we were healed see all blood blood blood then when the token comes it shows what you've been identified with that's sacrifice amen the devil can't keep you from it he says the blood purchased it but the Holy Ghost the token is the evidence of it and he says then once you're identified with it the devil can't keep you from it oh what a revelation the devil can't keep you from it he may trying to scare you you know like security they all look tough they all look mean they all look they're they're ready to to send you back but if you've got the token they can look mean they can intimidate they can pressure they can influence but they can't take you back and the devil can intimidate you he can pressure you he can influence you but with the token with the Holy Ghost he can't turn you around Hallelujah the devil cannot keep you from it and so but the brand tell us that there's a difference from the chemical the blood and the life he says under this glor place under this Covenant there's a difference between the blood and the life the token for the believer today is the Holy Ghost and so but the Brandon would tell us that whenever the the Holy Ghost would overshadow Mary he says the life would come inside and would create a blood shell right and he says that blood shell would create another cell it would create another cell it would create cells until Jesus would be birthed upon the Earth but he says whenever Christ was upon the cross and he was being crucified he says the blood chemistry would go back to the elements where it came from but the life would come back to the believer oh Hallelujah we may not got the literal blood but we've got the literal life and then brother br going say every believer can be wrapped in the life of that blood shell can be wrapped in other words whenever you're WRA in this life before the devil can get to you he's got to go through the blood and he can't get through the blood you remember brother brand was say many people say the devil made me do it and he says no he says you just wasn't born again he says once you're born again the only way the devil can get to you is to repent be baptized and be filled with the Holy Ghost then he's your brother you see before he can get through the blood he's got to become one of you and there's no way let me say this there's no way for the devil to become bride and there's no way for the bride to become serpent seed the devil likes to come and say you're serpent seed you've send your day of Grace away you're just you're part of the tribulation Saint if you're the bride of Christ you were born the bride of Christ this message didn't make you a bride it called you out to place you as the bride but you was born with the predestinated seed and there's nothing the devil can do to take that away from you Hallelujah once we're wrapped in the blood cell of the life that means you're secure brother Brandon going say another thing is a seal is security seal means you are secured you see not that and now you that don't believe in eternal security I don't know but now a seal signifies security to its destination woe unto the guy that would try to break that seal and the Holy Spirit cannot be broken you heard me say that the people said that devil made me do this no no no the devil didn't do it you just wasn't sealed in you see cuz when you're sealed in he sealed out now you went out to him he couldn't get to you because the only way he could come in through the same process that you have to come he'd have to be saved Sanctified filled with the Holy Ghost then he is your brethren but once you are wrapped in this life he says the God God is sealed in and the devil is sealed out and it's sealed to the the day of your Redemption it ain't sealed till tomorrow it ain't sealed to the next youth meeting you ain't sealed just to the next Convention of the next T meeting but you are sealed all the way to your destination you see my destination ain't to just the camp meeting next month that ain't my destination that's helping me get to my destination my destination ain't to just when I get graduated or if when I get married or when I become a father that ain't my destination my destination is when I Lay My Sword down for the last time and I fight the last mind battle and I step out of out of mortality into immortality that is my destination and so once you are sealed there's nothing that can unseal you you are secured and I believe that's where we are standing today not just partially sealed or partially separated but it's a perfect separation and you are perfectly secure to the day of your Redemption brother Brandon would say listen close while I make these closing remarks if Satan tries to hand you some of this stuff like sickness you know what to do to show him the token I'm a purchased product my healing has been paid for I'm a product of God you cannot keep me uh you cannot keep me off of this highway you cannot keep me from my health I present the token and show you by your stripes I was healed he is the resurrection here is the resurrection of Jesus Christ right in me now to prove to you oh there is a real thing there is a token and I like how he's putting it there's proof of the Resurrection in me now there is a real thing there is a token you see the devil can argue and say well the Holy Ghost is just emotion the Holy Ghost is just a sensation but there's evidence inside of you that's brought forth a separation that the devil can argue quotes he can argue scriptures but he cannot argue the life that has brought us separation oh Hallelujah right in me now is the resurrection of Jesus Christ Resurrection lives in me now Resurrection ain't coming it's in you now it's in you now it's quick in your mortal body you remember brother Brown matela would talk about Elisha that whenever he was dead would be in the would be in that cave he his bones were in the cave but the Brandon would tell us that there that there was a battle that was taking place and there was a man that had died and there was some friends that had picked up the man and would throw him in that cave but as soon as that dead body hit the bones of elasa but the brandom says quickening power were still on those bones and he says that dead body would come back to life and would run out of that Tob or run out of that cave could you imagine being those friends that would pick up your dead comrade and would throw him inside of that cave and he would come running back out you that's the way it's going to be one day you may be dead in the grave you may have your skin worms that is decay in your body but quickening power is still in that is still in those bones and there's nothing the devil can do to keep your body inside of the grave and I say there's nothing the devil can do to keep me out of a Rapture hey I may go the way of the grave but if I'm predestinated to go by the way of the Rapture there's nothing that the devil can do I've got quickening power on the ins shred of this body Hallelujah but you see how come it's the evening time that the devil's fighting so hard against the Holy Ghost have you ever thought about that how come it's the evening time cuz brother Brown I'm going tell us the lamb was killed in the evening time after being kept up for 14 days he says then the lamb was killed and the blood was applied in the evening time and so how come it's the evening time that the Holy Ghost is being being fought so hard against because the Bible would tell us that the blood of Jesus would speak better things than that of Abel you remember the story of there there in Genesis that God would come to come to Cain and would say where is your breth and Cain would say am I My Brother's Keeper you know and God would speak to him and would say your the blood of Abel speaks out against you and you and brother Bron the Bible would tell us the Apostle Paul would say the blood of Jesus speaks better things than that of Abel and so the blood of Abel would speak out against him but the blood of Jesus speaks out for you and so in other words under the Old Testament was condemnation but under the the New Testament the blood of Jesus ain't condemnation it's liberty and the and the Bible would tell us that the blood has a voice it speaks better things and brother Brandon would say now we also find in Hebrews the 12th chapter and the 24th verse first the New Testament the blood speaks better things the blood is speaking then the blood has got a voice and the voice of the blood is the word and so what we got in this generation is the loosening of the seals and what that is speaking is the voice of the blood and the Holy Ghost identifies you with what the voice of the blood speaks that's why the devil fights so hard against the Holy Ghost because the message has brought us our inheritance and says here's your body change here's your rapture and the Holy Ghost says hey that's mine it ain't just my neighbors it ain't just the pastor but it's mine it identifies you with what the word has brought but we're living in a day we're trying to cancel the Holy Ghost you know me and brother Andrew Glover had went to England uh I would say three years ago I think it was and and we had our tickets we had our token we got to our lay over there in Paris and and and that ticket got us through customs it got us through security and we find our gate and we wait there for about 3 hours you know and they start the boarding process and we get to the gate we get to the counter and we give them a ticket and they say and the lady says no you don't got a ticket and we say man we got a ticket no you don't got a ticket we said we got a ticket right here it's brought us this far and they says no you don't got a ticket go talk to go to the information desk and talk to them and here while we was waiting in line to see the information desk or our light left without us could you imagine that a ticket brought us that far but as soon as we got to the brink of our inheritance to the brink of the body change to the to the threshold of the Rapture they tried canceling our ticket and that's what the devil has done today you see they tried they canceled our ticket and expected us to get to our destination and the many times I hope this is okay people inside of a church tries quenching up the Holy Ghost and expect your young people to see a Rapture you your young people cannot see a Rapture without a move of God come on now they can't see Liberty without the move of God and we try to cancel the Holy Ghost it's the devil coming and trying to cancel the identification of what this message has brought us hey the Holy Ghost a't no sensation but we need the Holy Ghost to identify us with the word that has been brought in this generation oh Hallelujah we need the Holy Ghost brother Brandon must say the that the the life that is in you speaks from the shed blood amen hey old brother I wish everybody could see that see if you can see what it is it's the life that is in you see the blood is identifying you with it the blood is identifying you with it and so whatever the blood speaks then the Holy Ghost identifies you with it you know brother Brandon would say in a court he says when a court writes out a word he says the penalty is such and such he says the law of the Court enforces the word of the court and then he would say when God speaks anything that is Law and the Holy Ghost is here to enforce the law regardless of the conditions oh so just like the court whenever the judge gives a sentence the law enforces it that's the way it is with the word and the Holy Ghost whenever the word is brought to a generation ation then the Holy Ghost enforces that word and I believe that we're leaving in that time right now where the open book has been given to a generation that we know the thoughts of God we know what God has for this generation but we've got the token to enforce what the what the word has brought to us and so we've got a claim in this generation that has broken off every claim that the devil had a claim on us you know brother Brandon going talk about he says the title deed and there's the difference between the title deed and the abstract he says you can have the title deed but if there's claims against it all of that don't belong to you but he says if there's an abstract that knocks off every claim that the devil would have upon the title deed and he says you can have the word but there can be claims against you but with the abstract the Holy Ghost it knocks off every claim that is against you and brother Brandon would say this who are your sickness who do you think you are Satan who do you claim to be every claim that you had was cancelled at Calvary you're a bluff you have no rights we defy you in the name of Jesus Christ as a holy ghost filled of body who are you sickness who do you claim to be he says every claim was cancelled you know what that means whenever whenever the blood shell was released at Calvary that broke every claim you know generational curses or claims all right come on now generational curses can go from Marriage to marriage to marriage or go from from child to child to child where you're you're maybe your grandfather struggled with adultery then your daddy struggled with adultery now you're struggling with adultery it's a generational curse it's a claim that had that that is upon your life maybe a divorcement that was your grandparents was divorced your parents were divorced now the devil's coming and saying well you're just a another statistic you're going to be divorced just like them it's a claim that the devil thinks he has upon you but let me tell you a secret every claim has been broke there's an abstract in this generation that we've got the word yes but there was claims against him but we've got the holy ghost that has broke off every claim you know brother Brandon would talk about the the little girl with leukemia I think I believe it was he would say that sickness would go from grandparents to her parents to her and he says but once the abstract comes he says that broke that off and I believe that same Holy Ghost is here that was a natural sickness but maybe it's a spiritual sickness maybe pornography it's gone from generation to generation but that has been broke off you know brother Brandon would say this here uh just like sickness enter the body or or sin or whatever it is say will the other ones drink the others do this or the others be this way but he has no legal rights and I could take my abstract deed and go down to the court and say look at here someone here has moved in to my house that doesn't belong there that this is mine it belongs to me and the law would come up and put them out because I have an abstract written deed to the property and brother sister we have an abstracts written deed tonight to Salvation Divine Healing the devil has no rights trust God and the Holy Ghost to put him out amen I feel religious right now somehow I really do all right he said says if you've got the abstract title deed then that puts out the every every claim the devil would have upon you that's where we're living today but the brand said in another place and put it on the book of life but was born through a man and woman subject to sin and guilty of sin but when I believed on it I received the deed but when the Holy Ghost come it was the abstract that everything against me whether my mother done it my father done it my grandmother done it like the little epileptic child I prayed for a few minutes ago that come from the grandparents the epilepsy fell down upon that child but when the abstract come it struck it off it omitted everything and so the very sins that your mother would commit or your father would commit or your grandparents would commit when the abstract come it omitted it oh the devil has claims on us until the abstract comes oh Hallelujah you wonder how how boys are high passionate sometimes it's passed down or a gossip spirit it's passed down or or you know what I'm talking about you you can identify some things you know yeah this was passed down that was passed down but there's something here that has brought a separation where you don't got to be another statistic on how many's ever heard that voice before you're just another statistic well I'm a young boy so I got to look that pronography that's a lie that's a claim the devil thinks he has on you well I got to go out and smoke that's a you're going to be another statistic that's a claim the devil thinks he has or I got to look I got to fit in with the rest of the girls so I got to get my my maybe get some tighter skirts on some some skirts that come up a little higher that's the claim the devil thinks he has upon you but every claim has been broke oh Hallelujah you're not another statistic come on young people you're not another statistic you're not another statistic you're the bride of Christ you're not another sta istic of the devil to ruin your life and put put condemnation on you and put pornography on you and smoking and Drugs That's not what God has for you we're not statistics we're the bride of Christ and you would see that you would look at Rahab Rahab should have been another statistic you know cuz the Bible would tell us that her house was upon the city walls and could you imagine being being Rahab you're sitting there inside of your home and you see you look out the window and you see them marching around the walls the first day all the way to the seventh day and all of a sudden you hear a shout the trumpets are starting to blare and you feel a shaken and you look out your window this part of the wall is fall falling that part of the wall is falling and you know man I'm next I'm miss another statistic of this the walls falling down but then she could look to a promise I've got a true token I've got a true token you know what the Bible would tell us in Joshua 2 and12 now therefore I pray you swear unto me by the Lord since I have showed you kindness that you will also show kindness unto my father's house and give me a true token and so reab was sitting there in a shaking time looking like she was going to be another statistic but she can look to a true token oh we've got something in this generation we've got something true not a false token not a make Bel token we've got a positive token that can bring you out of the statistics and put you on a Sol that ground and say yeah that one there may be falling that house is falling apart that marriage is falling apart that young person is bound by addictions that Young Person's Bound by this they're Bound by that but sure not a part of that there's a separation and you know why Rahab would ask for a true token you know the Bible would tell us a few verses before that she's speaking to the spies now would say we have heard how how what you done to the Egyptians how your God split the Red Sea y y'all yall remember that scripture and she would continue on we have heard how your God done this and how your God done that and she comes down a few to the next few verses and we said there in made no more courage in any of the men's Hearts because of you and then the very next verse she says give me a true token she recognized that there was something Supernatural that was taking place and in order for her to be identified with the supernatural she needed the true token oh Hallelujah the move is on for the bride and I know it give me something true I don't want just some sensation I don't want some theology give me a true token that will separate me I don't want to water down religion give me something true yes sir give me something true Hallelujah give me something true where where I can intercede for for my loved ones where I can intercede for for lost parents where I can intercede for a rebellious teenager you know brother Brandon would say hold the token before your prayers you know he would say that he says hold the token before your prayers and he would say apply it to your family he says if you've got an unsaved child he says hold the token over them and say I claim them oh and that really spoke to me not God you claim them he says you claim them I claim them he says if you got an unsaved daughter say I claim them you see it's under a true token where we've been ident ified with the promises of God but random would say the true token of the blood speaking out speaks of a living resurrected presence of a living resurrected resurrected presence not a god of yesterday but a god of today and so it's something positive that has spoke for us because brother Brandon would tell us he would talk about Oswalt and you remember oswal brother Brandon would say could you imagine being him sitting in that prison cell knowing you just killed the president and says everybody the whole country is mad at you nobody's going going to want to speak for you could you imagine being in that condition knowing that if you're convicted for this you're going to be killed and no one's willing to speak for you then brother Brandon later on in that message he would put you in the prison cell and would say now you're in the prison cell you know you're guilty the judge knows you're guilty the jury knows you're guilty and he says but you need somebody to speak for you he says if you got somebody to speak speak for you he says then you can get a little more Assurance but you're not fully assured cuz you know they got to speak better things they with their shrewd speaking I love how he puts it he says if this attorney with the shrewd speaking and knowing of the laws could change that and complete your case and prove that you should live but yet in all of his great Authority and the great speech that he can make him the impression that he could put upon the jury or upon the judge he says maybe you can be relaxed be relaxed for a few minutes and I like how he's putting it's all upon the speech if he can speak better things if it's with the Shu speaking in other words he's got to speak better things than the evidence that is against you then brother Brandon would say but your judge became your returning to the very one that could bring judgment brought a separation oh Hallelujah and so the Devil comes and says that generational curses God's going to God's cursed you God's done this he he's thrown this upon you but in reality he is standing up speaking for you saying no you don't got to go that way I speak better things than that of generational curses I speak better things than that of condemnation I speak better things I'm speaking for you that's what makes the difference is the presence of God coming in speaking for you speaking in your behalf you know brother Brandon would say there's no devil that can stand before it there's nothing that can stand before it because God has accepted and you're and the you hold the token in your hand the price is paid oh it's a positive token the word positive means fully assured independent of changing circumstances unconditional so if you've got a positive token that means it's fully assured of what it speaks so when the blood speaks something it's positive it's fully assured no matter the conditions the Bible would tell us we have a more sure word of Prophecy and I like how it's putting it a more sure word of Prophecy not just a sure word but it's more sure we letting you know it's something positive you know when brother brandom he would he would preach the rising of the Sun and I think it's so incredible he would tell us that whenever the sun whenever he said let there be light and the and the sun would become the would come upon the Earth he says the Earth was laying there in a dark dismal gloomy atmosphere and I like that word gloomy you know cuz that that describes the age we're living in living in a negative world you know how many's ever been walking down the road like today I went to the gas station I walked in how are you doing oh just surviving it's a negative world you know you go down the road how are you doing how's your day today well this went wrong that went wrong maybe the dog bit the bit the mail man my car went and start and you hear the life story now you're you're wishing you didn't even ask right how many's ever been there it's a negative world it's a gloomy atmosphere where you wake up in the morning and man you it's it's gloomy that comes over you it's blue loose oh man this went wrong yesterday it's an atmosphere that comes over you and brother Brandon we we continue on to say a dismal gloomy atmosphere and the spirit of God moved upon the water and said let there be light and God had a reason to do that for beneath that water there were seeds that he had planted and had to have sunlight to make it live the the sunlight didn't plant the seeds but the sunlight came because seeds were already there but before that seed could be brought to life the Gloom had to be brought away oh come on and the same thing today there seeds this message didn't put the seed there it came because there was the seed there but the gloominess that the devil throws upon you has to be taken away he continues on to say and that was the first light that was that was ever given was God spoken word and he was saying he said let there be light and there was light that turned Darkness into light in order to bring the creation of Joy so before there could be a creation of Joy he says the gloomy atmosphere had to be taken away that's the reason God has given us a message he didn't want you being in the glooms he didn't want you being depressed that's judgment upon the Earth complexes he didn't want complexes upon you anxiety upon you that was a gloomy atmosphere but when God said let there be light there was a rising of the sun brother Brandon would talk about how in the rising of the sun he would say when the natural Sun would begin to rise he says it was that time it was a dual Sunrise he says when the natural sun came up he said also the spiritual sun came up not just the Su in but the S so in and we're living in a time where the word has been restored and it's brought a creation of Joy it's brought us something positive in a negative World we've got something positive you see the seeds were there but it was just covered over with gloom and your peace is still there maybe it's just covered up with Gloom maybe it's just covered up with depression your happiness is there maybe it's just covered up but we've had a positive word that is speaking better things you know it's troubless it's troubles in life that can bring us down into this atmosphere you remember there in Luke the Bible would tell us that Martha would would come up to Jesus and would start speak point out Mary she's doing this doing that doing this and Jesus would stop and look at her and would say Martha you were troubled about many things your TR it was the Troubles of life and and this really spoke to my heart the many times we can do this as Christians here stood Martha in the presence of Jesus you know if she had she needed healing in her body this was deity that could give it to her if she needed freedom from from troubless here was deity that could give it to her but in the Pres here here here she stood in the midst of Jesus Christ the god the maker of heavens and earth and the only thing she could point out was was the flaws of others yes sir come on now many times we get in troubl this this here happened that happened this happened and we come to church and God is speaking speaking to your needs speaking to my needs and we sit there saying oh yeah that person needs you oh hope so and so is listening I hope that one's oh man oh that one needs it you're troubled about many things and you're missing your visitation oh but the visitation is happening now it don't matter the troubles it don't matter the the gloomy ATM pheres it don't matter the negativity God deity is walking the AIS saying I've got a creation of Joy I know you might be in a creation or an atmosphere of Gloom but here's a creation the Bible would tell us that King Bazar was troubled and the and the countenance and his countenance changed and that's incredible it was because he was troubled it began to change who he was and that's what happens when we're troubled and we start to look at things in a different way you remember the disciples were upon the the boat and brother Brandon would tell us that they were they were telling testimonies of Jesus how he done this all all the Miracles and now here comes some troubles right here come some troubles it was the storm that would come against them the Bible would say in Luke 24:38 and he said unto them why are you troubled and why do thoughts arise in your heart what were those thoughts negative thoughts because the Bible says they come to Jesus and would say do you care that we perish think about that now there were just telling testimonies of the goodness of God but now because of the troubles they think God is against them oh how many's ever been there God you've left me God you forsaken me why did you allow this why why did you permit this to happen and instead of looking at the positive that all things work together for the good of for the for the good of those who love God we look up a negative God you forsaken me but here stood Jesus stood up and would say peace be still he brought he brought a positive in the negative oh and he's here to bring a positive in the negative it don't matter what what the trials you're going through we've got a positive token you know negativity can bring you down many times you know brother Brandon I'm going say this here you're in a need of prayer too cuz you got a heavy heart but God knows the secret of the heart do you believe it he can tell me what your heaviness is about it's because you want a baby and I see two Dark Shadows and you've had two miscarriages in your time that is correct so what what brought this heaviness was scars what brought this heaviness was hurts man we're human beings man we get hurt we get scarred well this one talked about me we get hurt hey words have words have edges man words can hurt you maybe somebody talked against you and now there's a heaviness that comes over you and now that heaviness brought on Dark Shadows and brother Brandon would would tell us that these Shadows were devils it was a hurt it was a hurt that brought a I brought an atmosphere of Gloom but here stood a word that will look through that atmosphere and would see a creation of Joy Hallelujah he will look through those clouds brother Brandon would say this you're a Believer your spirit is welcome see and I know that you are a Believer so here stands a Believer but he just has some he just has some heaviness upon him and he says you're aware that something is going on now that's what you see on that picture he points to the picture now the audience might know sir just the last few second something has been moving on you is that right raise up your hand see it's just settling down between you and I it becomes like a fog I am looking through it and I keep seeing somebody else cuz it's somebody you're here for it's a man and the man is a relative of yours he has lung trouble he's not in this city he's from a city where there's a mountain in St Bernardo he's a a a relative of yours in so much he's your brother-in-law and I see something strange it's a smoke or a fight it's a battle you're a soldier you've been a soldier you've been hurt you got hidden and something your left arm at the wrist that's right your request has been granted by God here stood a fog here stood a heaviness that maybe that man couldn't see through but there was a positive word that would look through that fog and would give him would let him know that God has heard your prayer maybe you can't see through the fog tonight maybe all you see is troubles all you see is the negative all you see is the hurts all you see is the scars but there's a word here tonight letting you know God is looking through it and he sees Victory he sees peace he sees Joy you're not going down you're going up there's a word it's a positive word letting you know there's a creation of joy you don't got to go out in a gloomy atmosphere you don't got to go in the Blues there's something positive Hallelujah there's something positive POS he another place now you're all right now you can raise your head raise your head feel it right now son is that right it's Devils you would have committed suicides and suicide in a few days that was on his mind he thought he had send his day of Grace away when he had come up a real black heavy like fog meeting me in the face that's Devils but the boy is free now go feel happy go home rejoicing thanking God for his goodness to you God bless you when this boy all he could see was suicide I'm preaching now all he could see was the fog all he could see was the heaviness all he could see was the depression or maybe the faults or the failures there was a positive word that says you're not going to commit suicide there's a word for you Hallelujah another place what's the matter soldier boy you're not going to commit suicide the devil's lying to you boy you've only got a phobia he's lying to you he will drive you ins sayane if if you believe him but deny him renounce the devil I command you in the name of Jesus Christ to renounce the devil except Jesus Christ as your healer you'll go back a gentleman a real man do you do you do it raise up your hands to God and say praise God that's right amen now go home and be well oh Hallelujah when this boy all he could see was suicide there was a word that would say no sir that's not that's not what God has for you you go home and be well and I say this evening you go home and be well you don't got to go in that atmosphere of Gloom you don't got to go in that suicide Spirit there's a creation of joy that the word has brought us hallelujah there's a creation of Joy there's a Garment of Praise for the spirit of heaviness a Garment of Praise You Remember the Bible tells us in Isaiah the spirit of the Lord is upon me you remember the scripture because the Lord has anointed me to preach Good Tidings unto the meek he has sent me to bind up the Brokenhearted and to proc Proclaim Liberty to the captives opening up the prisons to them that are bound proclaim the acceptable year of the Lord and the day of the visions of our God to comfort all that mourn to appoint unto them the mourn in Zion and to give unto them Beauty for Ashes the oil of joy for M mourning the Garment of Praise for the spirit of Heaven heaviness that they might be called the tree of righteousness the planting of the Lord that he might be glorified you remember there and then Jesus would take the scripture would take the Scrolls there there in in the temple I believe and he would start to quote this and would close it and we say this day this scripture is fulfilled and brother brandom says he didn't quote all of that second verse because it was pertaining to a second coming you remember that but we're leaving in the day where he's coming upon the Earth so that means oh Hallelujah that means to appoint unto them the mourn and Zion to give Beauty for them for ashes the allil of joy for mourning the Garment of Praise for the spirit of heaviness that is for today that is for today in the midst of gloominess in the midst of of atmospheres that comes against your mind atmospheres that comes against mamas atmospheres that comes against teenagers here stands the word of the Lord saying I'm giving you a Garment of Praise amen I'm giving you a Garment of Praise for the spirit of heaviness it's a spirit it's the same spirits that would that would stand in front of brother brand and that fog would come over the person is the same spirits today but the same word today that was back then is here today to let you know that you could have a Garment of Praise You Can Have a Garment of Praise now the Lord is that spirit and where the spirit of the Lord is there is Liberty that's what we feel in our services we don't got a dead letter but we got a Living Word what is that Living Word it's the same word that said let there be light and there was light is the same word here today what did that light do in the beginning it pushed back that atmosphere of Gloom and what would happen the Bible would tell us in 2 Corinthians 4:6 for God who commanded the light to shine out of Darkness I like how the Bible puts it who commanded he didn't say please let there be light he commanded for God who commanded the light to shine out of Darkness has shined in our hearts s and so the same God that said let there be light and a bright order out of chaos there upon the Earth is the same word that is bringing order in your chaos oh your life may look so chaotic right now and all you see is the chaos all you see is the heart broke all you see is this all you see is that but the same God that commanded that commanded with authority is commanding tonight not me I'm not saying me but there's a word that's coming across that is commanding the heav has to leave the heaviness has to leave that depression has to leave that anxiety has to leave not by me it's the word it's the same word that command a light in the beginning is the same word you know brother brother Brandon Matel us he would he would quote a scripture and says God or John says the concept of God was expressed in Jesus so the very very very thing of who God was was there in the body of Jesus and here we are today the body of Jesus ain't here among us but we got the same word the same anointing The Same Spirit but the brand say the very substance of God was made flesh and dwelt Among Us the very substance of God was made flesh and dwelt Among Us and here we are brother Brandon would say that the quickening power was come to us and opened up the seals and he would say what are those Seven Seals he says it's God he says God is that are those Seven Seals and that's who has been revealed to us in this generation is the very substance of God let our musicians come tonight it's the very substance of God he's the one that is bromus creation whenever the music's playing the creation of Joy is here whenever it's not playing the creation of Joy is here you see it don't matter what song's being played it don't matter if the if the drums are playing as long as there's a positive word I don't care about the music I don't care about the sing give me the word and we're thankful for those things I'm not Downing those but don't let me get so focused on these little things right that if our if our favorite song A being played right oh man I feel down oh I'm not going to get into the service that's an atmosphere but the devil's trying to keep you out of the creation of Joy sir when you're at home by yourself and you just feel so depressed I've been there man I've been there fighting complexes fighting insecurities fighting these things with this and for this and that and this but turn on a tape and that brings a creation of joy you that's the greatest advice I can give you know as me when you stand in prayer lines or something and some I can't get over this depression I can't that's a play a tape whenever that whenever those thoughts arise in your heart turn on a tape turn on some positive things don't listen to the negative if there's friends that are that are saying negative things do away with them I know that may sound harsh this ain't the time to be in negative this ain't time to speak speak negative things this ain't the time to speak the devil's thoughts what do Revelation 10 say go to the angel with the open book in hand and say give me the book you take and eat and what does the what does the Bible say after that you prophesy again you go to the angel with the open book in hand you take the book you eat the book and it shall be be be I think the Bible would say it shall be sweet in your mouth as honey but bitter in your belly but then you're going to prophesy again that's the nothing that's the positive the devil wants to come and say you're this you're that you're this you're that but the Bible already told us you're taking this open book you're taking this positive word and that's your confession you may say brother John sure to prophesy yes sir why why am I prophesy this word you may never have a vision you may never have a prophecy and you may never have a prophecy concerning you by somebody else that don't matter take this positive word that's my confession that's That's My Confession that's my attitude that's what I'm believing that's what I'm thinking that's what I'm saying whenever the Devil comes and he says well you're ugly well I'm beautiful in the sight of God well you're this well God sees me that way well you're this God sees me this way well you can't do this I can do all things through Christ who strengthens me I don't care the negative I got something positive well you'll never make it but I've already made it but the pr would go behind the curtain of time would say I saw you there it matter what the negative says well you send your day of Grace away you're never going to make it you'll never overcome but devil he already seen me there he seen you there you're going to make it you're going to make it buddy you're going to make a mama you're going to make it Daddy it don't matter the negative don't listen to the negative we've got something positive oh hallelujah it's troubless that comes upon us that's good there troubless brother Brandon would say may God Begin by your Spirit to give us a continuous lifegiving and prevailing Revelation oh if the church could ever get a fresh Revelation and become by it the Living Word manifested we would do the Greater Works and glorify God our Father in Heaven oh where is the substance of God it's in your body where is deity is in your body oh man that's why iica brother Brandon describes that in order for those seeds to come to life he had to push past the darkness you want to be the the Temple of the Holy Ghost you got to get past that that Darkness I've been a teenager it's hard I've been there with complexes people say something about you say something against you it hurts but there's a word there's a word that you got to look to remember the Bible would talk when God would speak to Abraham and would say after lot was separated he come and he spoke to Abraham and would say now lift up thine eyes and look from the place Thou Art Eastward Westward northward Southward God had given him the inheritance but before he could take it he had to look from his present condition he had to look from where he was to what God had promised him you got to look from where you are it don't matter where you're at this evening it don't matter the Gloom it don't matter the the the the the impossibilities it don't matter the finances it don't matter brother Josh you don't how we're going to make I don't know either but look from where you are look from where you are to the positive look from where you are brother brandom says and meet us Lord and give us one of the greatest nights that we've had yet people are waiting with great anticipation and Lord while we're anticipation May men and women look from this Earthbound condition that we're setting in to a heavenly father that is ready to pour out his blessings and power upon us may they look from this Earth bound condition to a Heavenly Father Deuteronomy 28:2 and all of these blessings shall come on thee and overtake thee that's your promise all of these blessings if you can just look from this Earthbound condition to a heavenly father that is ready to pour out his blessings these blessings are going to overtake you oh this ain't no Prosperity Gospel you might not be a millionaire but you can have your peace you can have your joy hey we got a Revival coming up next month you know what I say to do start digging dishes yes sir let's start looking right now let's start let's come with an ant anticipation this is going to be the greatest meeting that we've ever had this we're going to see Miracles we're going to see the move of God we're going to see the supernal we're going to see prodical come home we're going to see deliverances we're going to see the Holy Ghost fill our young people we're going to see marriage is fixed we're going to see these things I'm looking from where I am to a Heavenly Father father I'm not looking at my Earthbound condition I'm looking where two or three are gathered I will be in their midst it was in Second Kings the prophet would come and say dig these ditches dig these ditches dig this Valley full of ditches you're not going to know how the rain's going to come but when you get up that's going to be full and you notice the deeper they dug what water that was going to be there the deeper they dug they could have dug a little trench but that was all the water they was was going to get oh Hallelujah you may say yep I'm going to throw this out but that's all the water you're going to get what I say if I have to go to a brother and apologize I'm going to do it if I need to throw bitterness out I'm going to do it I'm digging if I need to get some gossip out I want to get it out I'm digging I want to see a Revival in my home I want to see Revival in my church I want to see Revival with my young people I'm going to start digging start digging and you know what the Bible says they got up on those Valley those ditches were full of water and then the Lord would say this is but a light thing this is a little thing and you know what would happen he would give them victory over the enemies that was against him so the the sacrifice of digging was just a little thing compared to the victory that was coming oh and I say that that the sacrifice of forgiving somebody the sacrifice of throwing bitterness out is just a little thing to the victory to the blessings to the windows of Heaven that is going to overtake you I said we've come too far to get hung up at the security line let's throw it out start digging the ditches oh Hallelujah start digging the ditches there's a there's a replacement going on but Jesus wants to give you the best thing that anybody could give you and the only one thing can give it eternal life healing for your body swap your weariness for Joy take the Gloom away and give you a shout of Victory swap your weariness for Joy oh that's what's going to happen tonight in these meetings there's a swapping taking place I'm throwing some things out in order for God to give me some things oh I know these meetings are a month out but let's make let's give make preparations right now hey we've had fires sent down we've had preachers invited way way before now you know what I say we need to start doing as soon as the flyer send out we start making preparation yes sir as soon as

bride's Revival come on now the preachers going be studying for a year straight oh it's all the way since last year for this coming year but if you're not prepared for it it's not going to do any good for you oh I'm making preparations I'm digging ditches I'm digging these ditches saying God I need something from you I need something from you let's be personal let's be personal I need something I don't care about that one I love that one but I need something from you I need some loved one saved I need a refilling of the Holy Ghost I need my marriage my my marriage is Rocky right now I need you you're you're being personal with your anticipation but brandom would say if if there's only one person in this city that is going to make a Rapture around that person that's not being selfish that's being expect that's under an expectation there's only one person that gets that gets freedom from anxiety I'm that person if there's only one person that gets a Deliverance I'm that person brother Brandon I say the Bible said he ascended upon high and gave gifts unto men there was an atmosphere that hung over the Earth of Darkness of Gloom of death of weariness the prayers couldn't even go up because the atonement wasn't made but he broke through that Veil he opened up the way he broke through the veil of sickness he broke the veil of sin the veil of weariness he broke the veil of depression he broke every Veil the veil of weariness the veil of weariness we can get so tired we all sees the problems but he broke through that Veil and said here's a creation here's a swapping just look from this place let's bow our heads tonight the Bible would say in 1 Peter 1:6 wherein you greatly rejoiced though now for a season if need be ye are in heaviness that heaviness that we're in is just for a season but the victory that we're going to take is eternal maybe if somebody want to lift up their hand and say brother Josh I'm in that atmosphere God bless the hands I'm in that atmosphere right now all I see is the Gloom all I see is the the heaviness but God is here to make a swap swap that heaviness for for a Garment of Praise dear heavenly father Lord there's hands all over this building lord lord they're looking from this Earthbound condition to a Heavenly Father Lord you've given us a positive token that is identifying us with the word for this generation that are saying let there be light and that atmosphere of Gloom has to go Lord we're identified with that tonight Lord Lord I don't know the situations the conditions father but you do Lord God I've done my best to surrender to you so that you can speak to the needs Lord whatever these needs are Behind These uplifted Hands I ask that you would deal with them Lord touch the hearts God if they need a swaer may they swap it Lord whatever it is if they need to dig ditches may they dig ditches father if they need a forgive a neighbor May a forgiven neighbor father Lord the hardest thing sometimes is to look to you and say I understand I might not know but I trust you God heaviness sometimes can come by hurts not knowing why not knowing why just like that your Prophet dealt with this lady with two miscarriages she had she had no control over it God maybe she got bitter at you and that's why the where this heaviness came from but Lord there was was a word that will look through it maybe there's somebody here that is bitter at you because there are some things they had to go through but God I ask that this word would Pierce through that bitterness and would say hey there's a creation of Joy whatever the need is tonight father I ask that you would speak to him in Jesus name Amen in the name of Jesus it's power in the name of Jesus to Break Every Chain Break Every [Music] Chain you don't got to be in that heaviness you know brother Brandon would say that the devil had would cause somebody to impersonate this gospel then deny it to rise up doubt in your heart heaviness can come by

amen is that the truth to break every chain every feeling every adversity I believe that God has given us the ability to break through it tonight do you believe that I don't thought that was a powerful message we get so many troubles up in our life and you say brother Matt I want that kind of a breakthrough and looking forward to what God's going to do in that meeting and I'm looking forward what God's doing tonight amen what he's doing in hearts and lives is isn't that what Jesus said when Martha came to him he said Martha you're cumbered about much serving he said but Martha or Mary hath chose that one thing that was needful she has chosen the good part that shall not be taken from her you know what Mary was doing she wasn't doing all the work that Martha was doing but she was sitting at the feet of Jesus he said and she chose the thing that was needful that wouldn't depart from her I think that's what we ought to do tonight to find oursel you said brother M how do we break through all that how do we how do we make preparation is to sit in the presence of the word of God you get sitting in the presence of God and the atmosphere of God and you'll be able to come to church and you'll have a breakthrough every service the things that you've been cumbered about they'll fade away because you're sitting in a place and taking the good part that can't be taken away from you don't be cumbered don't be worried and troubled but sit at the feet of Jesus take the word of God and push play said take a take a tape and put it on when you get to feeling bad sit in the presence of God and allow God to be able to speak their hearts in the presence of the word of God and let bitterness and worry and trouble let it just fade away choose the one thing that is needful amen you need him tonight that's what we need friends you me me tell you what the devil does he'll take every life that you'll give him and he'll destroy it and he'll take it farther than it ever wanted to go a little bit of bitterness can take a person's life in in just a few in just a few months and years sometimes days a little bit of bitterness it can take a life to you can't even recognize the person that it took and that's what Satan wants to do with you to put a little bitterness in your heart till he could take you to your soul you're so tore up and before long you're so tore up at everybody you'll turn to alcohol and drugs and all these things until there ain't nothing left of your life it'll be a total wreck and the devil will sit there and laugh and then he'll leave you leave you in that condition he don't want nothing good for your life he wants to destroy you but I say choose the good part that can't be taken from you choose the one thing that's needful tonight that can't be taken from you and say Lord I pray you would have mercy upon me am he's a just God he's just to forgive God have mercy upon us Lord don't let me be found sometimes God allows you to see things to say this is where you could be Lord don't let me be found in that place but let me choose this one thing that is needful let me find you let me find myself at the foot of the cross amen I thank God that he reminds us sometimes of the path that we could go down but we have a positive word tonight that is not your path somebody say that with me that is not my path that's not your path brother that's not your path that's not your end I choose the one thing that's needful amen you love the Lord tonight can we worship him a moment before we go I saw the Lord and he answered me he

renew his strength Lord we ask go with each one as we go from this place we ask in the name of Jesus Christ we pray amen amen amen you love the Lord tonight amen w't you you give him another hand clap of Praise amen we just we want to make a quick announcement um we had a brother Marlo py had asked the church brother we've been helping in India and I don't know how many that has the bulletin that we just started sending out this month but we kind of put a a little bit of the testimony or what we're doing with their Church in India uh but I wanted to make uh make it clear tonight and give anybody an opportunity that wanted to help help towards it uh their Church uh you may remember this last year we done the same thing but their church is in a city that is uh that is tens of millions of people and uh they obviously don't have the money to own a building uh or they even rent a building to have church in uh for a week at a time so they actually rent the building and for several years this is their home Church uh this is the brother we've started over 50 churches uh with his ministry throughout India and they have huts and different things that we've helped to do and and he's just had a real wonderful Ministry there but at their home Church they actually rent the building only for the hours that they're able to have service so they rent the building for two or three hours on a Sunday and they rent it for a couple hours two or three hours on a Wednesday night the rest of the time the building is used for other things that's the only way they could even Gather in that big of a city in order to have service uh there's several hundred Believers that come together but they're very poor people um and what this has caused is because of this they're not able to have instruments and and and the and the you know the Altar and different things the the the pull pit and things they're not able to be kept in the building and so for so long these brothers had packed this and they took them home and they they they they rent Rick Shaws some of them walk them home some of them walking two or three miles carrying a speaker and would store the speaker in their house just to be able to have it for service so last year we started helping their Church where they could rent a storage building that was that was put up somebody had a mind to turn a building into a storage facility right where they had church and so we rented them one of those storage buildings to put all of the church uh equipment in so that on Church day they could just go there and then they could set it up in the morning and have service and so um they they try to raise up money each month last year we raised money and we just paid for it for a whole year uh it's about 23 $2,400 to rent that for 12 months uh for the storage facility and and and all that right there so uh we're going to try to do that we we've sent some money there to support them uh I've already made a commitment to send that and we sent it out in the bulletin to let everybody know but I just wanted to give the church an opportunity that anybody that had something on their heart they'd like to give toward I believe that God will richly bless you uh for doing that they're true saints of God and I know we get offers all the time uh things online people trying to get you to donate to things and uh so I'm always cautious of that but these are these are Saints that's that we worked with and uh for many years so if you have something on your heart you'd like to give just ask you to get with uh brother Morgan or brother Phil uh as you go out and they'll get that to us and we'll we'll add that to our offering to be able to send uh to make sure that they are able to cover that so we certainly appreciate appreciate all you do I know we uh we we always we give a lot you already do uh and I believe that God has has tremendously blessed our church we're a giving church we support the missionary work we want to see the move of God and the work of God uh not just in in our area but wherever we can support it around the world and I believe that it takes of people that dedicated to that and I believe that God blesses our church accordingly amen and so we certainly appreciate all that you do and and I know those Saints appreciate it as well so God bless you as you go tonight we'll take the name of Jesus with you [Applause] child well I know he will joy and comfort give you so take it everywhere you go well precious oh how sweet hope of Earth and joy of heaven we have precious name oh how sweet hope of Earth and Joy Of Heaven [Music] [Applause] [Music] you [Music] [Applause] [Music]
