You used gas money and travel and gave up sleep and time work and all that just to be in the house of the Lord this morning. So we we don't want to do all of that and then not miss the most important part and that's making him welcome in our presence. Amen. And so we just want God to be welcome. you love the Lord this morning, want to greet our visitors this morning. May God bless you and I just trust something to be said that would [music] be a help uh to the body of believers and Amen. We just we just worship the Lord according to the dictates of our own heart. Amen. And we're going to do something though. Amen. Blink twice if you have to. Amen. At the presence of the Lord. It's just good to be in the house of the Lord. Good to see Jordan and Xavier back [music] with us. And and uh Yeah, little little darling Clarabel. I'm glad she brought her parents to church this morning. I knew she was a good girl all along.

Just want to remember him and also for brother Marty Mccomomas their family. They called the the family inh today and don't expecting him to live much longer. So we just want to uh call his name before the Lord. And I believe that God is certainly more than able. He knows all things and we trust the Lord. [music] Amen. In all things. So, why don't we just pray uh together this morning? If you have a need on your heart, just lift your hand to the Lord. I know that he's mindful of what we have need [music] of and uh certainly certainly more than able. Let's just pray together. Gracious heavenly father, [music] Lord, how we love you this morning, Lord, and I just say it's a privilege to know you, Lord, and to know that you know me. And Lord, you've never forgotten us. You've never forsaken us, Lord. many times that we've [music] needed you, Lord, and called upon you and you've always done what your word said you would do. Lord, you hear our prayer and you help in a time of need. And God, we trust you, Lord. We trust your leading in our life. Lord, we trust your decisions that you make for us, Lord, knowing that your direction is greater than any direction. Even if it's beyond our understanding, Lord, we still stand here trusting you this morning. Lord, we just ask you, Lord, that you would have your way in this service. Lord, I just pray that you would take every sick person, Lord, that you would heal their body. And Lord, those that just need a touch from you, Lord. May you come by, Lord, and just touch them this morning. Lord, as we take the word of God and we look upon it and read it and speak about it, Lord, may the anointing of the Holy Spirit be present among us, Lord. May you anoint these words, Lord, and make them live among your children that we would go from this place, Lord, being stronger in faith and be strengthened as believers, Lord, to know where we stand. Lord, we just thank you for all that you do. And we give you the glory for all that's done. In Jesus [music] name we pray. Amen. Amen. How many say amen this morning? Amen. We just certainly enjoy those songs. Enjoy those specials this morning. How many enjoyed those? Y'all go ahead and let them know. I I sure appreciate anointed singing. And Amen. Just, you know, that that was I think that was two first. That was Weston's first special and &gt;&gt; [music] &gt;&gt; uh with with mom up there and then I think it was Destiny and Haven's first special together. So I I just love special things and uh [music] and the gifts in these uh ladies lives that God uses them and to create an atmosphere for the word of God to go forth. Amen. I believe that's the purpose of it. And we certainly don't sing to put on a a show or to make a a concert or something. Uh but we but we sing to uh invite the presence of the Lord and to make an atmosphere that God would be welcome. Amen. So, we just want to uh approach the word of God this morning. And and uh we we sure want to invite you to the book of Exodus, the 7th chapter, and we'll read out of the first verse. And Amen. We we enjoy the the preliminaries. Enjoy the worship service. But I want to ask you this this morning. How many enjoys the word of the Lord? Amen. Amen. We certainly uh enjoy it. It's lifegiving. just uh it don't take very much of God's word to to bring life to a believer to change a situation and uh to give answers to questions and uh so I want to read out of Exodus the 7th chapter. We're going to read in the first verse this morning down through the fifth verse and then we'll also uh turn to Revelations the 10th chapter and read from the first verse there. So starting with Exodus in the seventh chapter, the Bible says, "And the Lord said unto Moses, see, I have made thee a god to Pharaoh, and Aaron thy brother shall be thy prophet. Thou shalt speak all that I command thee, and Aaron thy brother shall speak unto Pharaoh, that he send the children of Israel out of this land. And I will harden Pharaoh's heart, and multiply my signs and my wonders in the land of Egypt. But Pharaoh shall not hearken unto you that I may lay my hand upon Egypt. So here that God says he won't listen so that I could lay my hand upon him and and bring forth mine armies and my people, the children of Israel, out of the land of Egypt by great judgments. And the Egyptians shall know that I am the Lord when I stretch forth mine hand upon Egypt and bring out the children of Israel among them. Now, I'd also like to read out of the book of Revelations, and we're going to uh read in the 10th chapter and in the first verse. And the Bible says, "And I saw another mighty angel come down from heaven clothed with a cloud, and a rainbow was upon his head, and his face was as it were the sun, and his feet as pillars of fire. And he had in his hand a little book open, and he set his right foot upon the sea, and his left foot upon the earth. And he cried with a loud voice, as when a lion roarth. And when he had cried, seven thunders uttered their voices. And when the seven thunders had uttered their voices, I was about to write. And I heard a voice from heaven, saying unto me, Seal up those things which the seven thunders uttered, and write them not. And the angel which I saw stand upon the sea, and upon the earth, lifted up his hand to heaven. And he swear by him that liveth forever and ever, who created heaven and the things that are therein, and the earth and the things that are therein, and the sea, and the things that are therein, that there should be time no longer. But in the days of the voice of the seventh angel, when he shall begin to sound, then the mystery of God would be finished, as he hath declared to his servants, the prophets. And we'll just ask the Lord to add add his blessing to the reading of the word this morning as you take your seats. And I would like to take as a subject this morning. When I stretch forth my hand. When I stretch forth my hand. How many loves the uh the opening of the word. Amen. We certainly uh certainly love the the message that God has sent us in this hour. Been such a a revealing. Without it, we wouldn't know where we are or who we were or uh none of those things. But we certainly love the word of God. and it being uh revealed to us. I don't just want something to be revealed to somebody. I want it to be revealed to me. Amen. And how many's like that this morning? Don't don't just give it to somebody else. But Lord, if you have something, go ahead and give it to me. Amen. Don't want to sound greedy, but when it comes to the things of God, I want all of it that God has. Brother Mark was preaching Wednesday on God's benefits. And I thought, I want every one of them. If God has a benefit, I just just put me down for all of it. And you know, last week we were speaking on how uh that it took the supernatural in the first Exodus and and that it would take uh the supernatural was what brought them out and how it would take the supernatural uh in this this Exodus to do the same thing. And uh we had talked about how the prophecies had gone forth concerning the Exodus and how that they were that those prophecies had already been fulfilled. remember even in the days of Jesus and we uh had talked about how that uh how that the prophecies uh concerning Jesus had been fulfilled in Jesus's day. So uh so therefore when the prophecy said a virgin shall conceive, a virgin did conceive and he came forth. He would be born in Bethlehem. It already happened. He would be forsaken. He would he would hang from a tree. And so, uh, we were showing how that these prophecies that were concerning the coming of the Lord are not the prophecies that we're looking to today, uh, for the second coming, but they were for the first coming. And, and every one of them have came to pass. And so, uh, we're not looking back at that. We're not looking for, uh, this to happen again or something to, uh, to be a repeat. But now, we find ourselves in this third Exodus. And in this third Exodus, the same thing. Uh, we have prophecies concerning our day. So, we kind of went through theirs and went through uh Egypt and went through uh uh uh uh uh the day whenever Jesus was upon the earth. But now, uh it comes to our day. And I want to uh begin right in Exodus the 7th chapter because it really opens something up about the age that we're living in. And uh of course, when we read the opening scripture, God is sending Moses and Aaron into the house of Pharaoh. And I love how that God orchestrates this because he tells Moses before he goes into this place, he says, "I'm going to show I I want you to go in and Pharaoh, he's going to ask you to show him a miracle. But when he asked you to show him a miracle, I want you to tell Aaron to put his rod on the ground and that rod shall become a serpent." And so before they ever went into the house of Pharaoh, God began to give them and orchestrate how it was going to play out. And the Bible said that Moses and Aaron, they went in unto Pharaoh and they done as the Lord commanded and and Aaron cast his uh rod upon the ground. It became a serpent. But watch what Pharaoh does that after he is obeying the Lord. And then Pharaoh, the Bible says, he called his wise men and he invited them to the house of Pharaoh and the magicians of Egypt and they and and they did the sorcerers and they did just like the that Aaron done in the manner of their enchantments. They uh they they cast down every man his rod and those rod became serpents and and uh but the Bible says but Aaron's rod swallowed up their rods and he hardened Pharaoh's heart that he hearken not unto them. And you know I thought this was something. Did you notice that uh that whenever Pharaoh's heart became hardened that it never discouraged Moses. It never uh discouraged Aaron. It didn't bring a discouragement because he wouldn't hear the word of the Lord. It didn't bring a discouragement that they brought in their own sorcerers and and and and through their enchantments which was just a a secret art or a secret a secret work that they done. And so uh but it wasn't a discouragement to to Moses because the Bible says he hardened Pharaoh's heart and he hearkened not unto them as the Lord had already said. So So the reason it wasn't a discouragement to Moses is because it's never a discouragement when prophecy is fulfilled. So, it don't matter if it's a negative thing. It don't matter if somebody responds negatively. But, but because it was a prophecy that was fulfilled, it's never a discouraging thing because God had already told them what they would encounter. He said, "You're going to go there. He's going to ask you for a sign. You're going to throw down your staff and the staff will become a serpent and and and his heart heart will be hardened and he's not going to receive you." So, God had already laid it out. And because it was prophecy and because it was fulfilled, [snorts] then they weren't discouraged by by what took place. And and so what Moses done, he just followed what God said. He said, "If it's going to work just the way the God says it, well, tomorrow I'm going to act just like God told me to act. I'm going to do just what God tells me to do." And the Bible said the next morning, then God began to bring judgment upon Israel. Remember, he brought the first plague. And he went down and he stretched his hand out upon the waters of Egypt. And God said, "It'll become blood. The vessels of wood, they'll be filled with blood. The rivers and waters will be filled with blood. The uh the the the the vessels of stone, they will be filled. They'll be filled with blood. Everything in Egypt was filled with blood. What they would drink out of it was filled with blood. There was no water to be found in all of Egypt. And and the Bible says when he smoked the river in the sight of the servants, everything became blood. The fish died. The the the land uh uh began to stink. The river began to stink. They the Egyptians couldn't drink the water. But then after all this took place, well then Pharaoh caused the magicians back into the place and the and the Bible says and the magicians of Egypt did so with their enchantments. And so Pharaoh's heart was hardened. Neither did he hearken under the word of the Lord. So here uh seven days goes by. Moses comes back and he and as the water uh becomes or as he would bring the next plague, the Bible said he laid his stretched his hands out over the waters of Egypt and frogs came up out of the out of the water that cover the land of Egypt. And then Pharaoh called in the magicians and here they come in and the Bible said, "And the magicians did so with their enchantments. They brought frogs upon the land of Egypt." So here we go again. Seven days goes by and now Pharaoh begins to in his heart to realize that this is becoming a great problem in this land. All of a sudden he becomes burdened by the judgment or the plagues that is coming on the land of Egypt. So he makes a deal with Moses. If the frogs will leave and you can get rid of it, then I'll go ahead and I'll let these people go. And so seven days the frogs are cleaned up. The uh there there's piles where they were. It's a it's a mess in the land of Egypt. And of course, Pharaoh being the kind of man that he was, he wasn't able to keep his word. And and so he didn't let the people go. So the Bible said, now here comes the third plague. And now Moses comes back in to the land of Egypt. And he and he smites the dust on the land. He stretched forth the hand upon the dust and it became lice all through the land of Egypt. And and and the Bible said, "But then the magicians came and did so with their enchantments to bring forth lice, but they could not." So there was lice upon every man and upon every beast. So all of a sudden we realize that these magicians there they're they could only go so far. So we went through the first plague and the second plague. You realize there was 10 plagues that came upon Egypt. But from but from the time of of the frogs and the time of their their their secret little sorcery or their secret tricks that that they would put to make it mimic what what God was doing that after that second time they weren't able to replicate it. They weren't able to do it. And finally, the magicians came back to Pharaoh and had to admit to Pharaoh that this is only the finger of God that could cause this to happen. We've done all that we can. In other words, uh you know, our folly has been made known. The tricks can only go so far. There's only so many serpents up a sleeve. There's only so many frogs up our sleeve. There's only so many ways that we can make water appear to be blood. And and so but when it came to creating lice and to bringing flies and and to bringing disease upon animals and putting bulls upon a man's skin and and taking bulls off or bringing a great hell storm or locust or darkness or even killing the firstborn, you realize that their ability only went so far. So, but when you read about these magicians and these sorcerers, you'll find out that uh that that they're not even mentioned in the Old Testament. Their names are not mentioned. You'll you'll never find them, but you'll find Paul actually brings their names. He actually introduces uh in Paul in the second chapter of Timothy the third verse uh uh Paul Paul was or in second Timothy the third chapter Paul would speak of the last days and he would talk about the age that we're living in and how that he said the last days perilous times shall come. I'm building a foundation for something but he said in the last days perilous times shall come and men shall be lovers of pleasure more than lovers of God and they be heady and high-minded. And in this scripture that Paul talks about the last days and how that men will be in this last days in the eth verse Paul said and as Janice and Jambber withstood Moses so do these also resist the truth they're men of corrupt minds of repbate concerning the faith. I think this is such a powerful type that Paul used it it it's quite an eyeopener that Paul would use this as a a description of what the people the men would be like in the day that we're living in. So here that Paul the prophet he actually identifies a spirit that's going to be present in the last days would be the same spirit of Janice and Jambers. And so uh you know he uses their names and you won't find them in the Old Testament but you actually can find their names many places in in the if you ever if you ever look in history there there was there was a book called uh the apocryphen of Janice and Jammeris. It was an old Greek book that was found uh that that some portions of it that describes the exploits of these magicians uh even in the Talmud which was the the the legal uh rulings for the Torah or the Hebrew uh Bible. The Talmud is what the the the the Judaism had gathered and and made this is the law and this is what we accept to be truth. Even in the Talmet, they would accept these magicians in the presence of Moses uh to be the same ones that Paul was speaking of named Janice and Jambers. And so, but understanding who they were is not as as important as understanding what they did. There's a reason why Paul would bring this out and he would speak of Janice and Jammeris and and the power that they had these Egyptians had and and how that they tried to replicate the miracles that were performed by Moses and Aaron. And you notice what their purpose was? It was to counter their authority before Pharaoh. Excuse me. So their purpose it was it [clears throat] was to challenge the authority of God's prophet. So here Paul is expressing what is going to be present in this age. He said here they came their purpose it'll be to challenge the authority of God's prophet. But I want you to notice something that this didn't end in Egypt. Because if you'll study or if you ever look at Jewish tradition they actually identify Janice and Jammers as servants of the prophet Balum. uh they would say that Balam uh that that they were they served under him and went out and followed them into the wilderness and and matter of fact they were a part of the men that actually encouraged the uh the the golden calf to be built. And I know that's not well known but uh but but in history they were uh they were known to be encouraers of those that would build a golden calf so that when Moses was up in the wilderness uh that that they would come in they were always undermining what Moses was doing. I don't know if they did that or not. That's just a Jewish tradition. Uh but but here whenever you read that or hear it, you know, it it shows us that if they were followers of Balum and they followed what you have, brother Mark, is you have unbelievers that were serving a makeeliever in the presence of true believers trying to discredit what the prophet of God was doing in the age that he was called to do it. I I think this is a powerful revelation because when you understand what that spirit does, it makes it easier to identify it today. And it don't matter what you read. That spirit has been made well known. And Paul said, "For these are the sort that creep into houses and lead captive silly women and laden with sins and led away with divers's lust. They're ever learning." Talking about these silly women, ever learning, never able to come to the knowledge of the truth. These are the sorts that come into these houses. And these are the sorts, these men like Janice and Jambers. He says, "See there we we realize that today that many good people have been affected by the same spirit of Janice and Jambers. They they have been led astray. They're going in the camp of Israel and they're and they're because they're unbelievers and and they're le leading people away by divers lust. They're leading people away and leading them and captivating them by sin. Women that are laden with sin and they they'd rather serve the world than serve God. All it took was a little voice or a little spirit of Janice and Jammers to come in the house and to discredit the prophet of God and and what God was doing in the age that they live in. And that's what Paul is is testifying or prophesying as what would happen in this age. Friends, this is a powerful revelation to catch because it opens your eyes that that's what's taking place in this age. There's a spirit in the land today that would cause the people of God to turn away from the move of God or the prophet of God and to say that there's something else or you know that discredited. Even other men was able to do that and other people preached that doctrine and you know other people before them had a word like that. And so so you recognize the spirit, but I want to show this that before Paul ever says it and before he ever warns of them, Jesus when he was speaking of the end time, remember we're talking about the prophecies concerning our age today. And and when Jesus would speak in Matthew the 24th chapter, he said as he sat up on the Mount of Olives, remember he was speaking of the end time to the disciples and and they said, "What when shall these things be? And what is the sign of thy coming? And what is going to be the end of the world?" And when Jesus speaks of what the end of the world would be like, he he would talk, you notice what he would we would talk about how that things would take place and what and if you ever you ever studied the scripture, I'm not going to go through it all this morning, but but if you ever study the scripture in Matthew 24, Jesus is answering what the end of the world would look like. This is a very question. How will I know that we're living in the end time? And as he would lay this out in Matthew the 24th chapter, you'll find that that he actually is actually speaking the very same things that would take place in the opening of the seals in Revelations the 6th chapter. I know I know many of you have studied it or or or listen to the series of the seals and and or the opening of the seals or the seven seals. So but but we realize that what was taking place just for the sake of of some new people. Let let me just can I just lay this out here? We come here to have church anyway. and and but Revelations the 5th chapter John sees this in a vision. He said, "I saw in the right hand of him that set up on the throne a book that was written and on the backside it was sealed with seven seals." So here here in John's vision, he saw the throne of God in his hand was a book. It was sealed with seven seals. In other words, it was not open. It was a mystery. It would remain a mystery. Even when John saw it, he said, "Seal it up until the last days when the seventh angel would sound. The mystery of God would be made plain." So we see in the opening of the seals in Revelation the sixth chapter, brother Bramwood preached through this, but in the opening of the seals, notice how how he speaks this. He says uh in Revelation 6, and when the lamb opened one of the seals, the first seal, he said, I saw behold a white horse, and he that sat upon him had a bow, and a crown was given unto him, and he went forth conquering and to conquer. Now, I don't know about you, you know, you if you if you read your Bible, maybe if you open it up whenever you get home, open up to Revelation 6. I have a a chain reference Bible. So it has the commentator on the side and and uh in the very chain reference of my Bible, it actually takes this scripture of Revelation 6 and2 and and in the chain reference, it references it to Revelations 19:11. How many knows what 1911 is? Revelations 19:11 is whenever Christ would come on a white horse. The Bible said he came on a white horse. It was him that was called faithful and true. So even in my own Bible when I read it without a revelation the I'm not saying the Bible's wrong but the commentator was wrong whenever he put it in there it made them the same because he said there this was Christ just like it was in Revelations 19:11 it was the same Christ but you notice what happened is as Jesus as as the seal was being open can you take some of that high down off of this brother. Thank you. as the seal was being opened, the um uh the that that the prophet of God would actually take this scripture and bring a revelation or a mystery that's been laying there the whole time and show that it wasn't Christ at all. And he and it wasn't what was present in the scripture that made him know it, but it was what wasn't present. Remember, he said because he had a bow, but you'll notice that he never had any arrows. So therefore, he was a bluff and and so so he so this was a this was one that was pretending to be a Christ. Now, if you'll go back to Matthew the 24th chapter, whenever Jesus is speaking, uh he says that in the first verse, he says, "Take heed that no man deceive you." Remember, what will it be like in the end? Jesus says, "Many shall come in my name, saying, I am Christ and shall deceive many." So, that's why the prophet of God would show us that Matthew 24 is actually prophesying of the seals being opened. M and I'm not going to go through it this morning, but all through Revelation 6, even the very next verse, Jesus said, "Nation shall rise against nation, kingdom against kingdom. There'll be famines and pestilence in the land." And and when you read Revelation 6, you'll see right there and the second seal was open. It said there was a power given unto him to take peace off of the earth that they would kill one another. It was given him a great sword. So Jesus shows us that what's coming in the end time or what's a sign of the end time or sign uh uh uh that the rapture is at hand a sign that we're living in that last age. He's showing us is whenever these seals are open is a sign of that very thing. So now watch what Jesus does. As a part of that answer, he says during this time in Matthew 24, he said, "There shall arise false Christ and false prophets and shall show great signs and wonders in so much that if it were possible, it would deceive the very elect." So here, here Jesus lays this out that there is coming false Christ. There's coming false prophets that'll show great signs and wonders, and if it was possible, they would deceive the very elect of God. So notice first Jesus speaks this. There's coming false Christs. There's coming false prophets. Then Paul comes right in behind them. And he said, "In that day, there's religious people. They'll have a form of godliness. They'll lead silly women away with all kinds of worldly lust." And and friends, let me tell you this. As much as they stood there in the day and resisted Moses today, that spirit is still here to resist and to withstand. You say, "Well, who are they resisting?" Let me tell you, it's wherever the truth of God is coming from. So if God is going to bring a truth in this age, then you better believe there's a spirit of Janice and Jambers that is present in this age to lead people away from the truth of God to to discredit the power of God, to discredit the supernatural. And and when God's trying to bring a revelation to the church, there's going to be a spirit just like Janice and Jambers that is going to be there to resist. Let me tell you friends what we ought to do this morning. You ought to look the devil in the eye that pushes against the truth of God and pushes against the word of God and say, "Devil, you found a truehearted believer." So when the devil comes pushing, then we ought to turn back to him and say, "But you found one here that you can't bluff, that you can't deceive, that you can't push because I'm a believer. I'm a son of God. I'm a daughter of God. And I just so happen to push back." I think it's time this morning that when the devil pushes that we go ahead and throw our shoulders back and take the word that God has given us and push back on the devil and say, "But I've been called in this hour and I realize there's false Christ and there's false prophets and there's false teachers that have been raised in this age with the spirit of Janice and Jammers to lead people astray. It don't discourage the believer when you see these things happening because it's already been prophesied that would happen in this. There's many prophecies that are concerning the age that we live in. Paul said in the last days, these times will come. Jesus said this will be a sign of the end times. See, there's a reason that the same type of spirit of Janice and Jambers would return. It's because it's at the end time. It's in when they appeared before they appeared in an Exodus age. It was at the time of Exodus. It was a time of departure and going into this new land that they would come present. And friends, but now here we are in the end time. and we find oursel in another Exodus age. It's no wonder Paul would pick them up and say in the last days that same spirit will be there resisting the truth of God's word. But see, that ain't the only thing that would be there in the end time. Remember what Jesus said, Luke 17, prophecies concerning our age. He said, "The days will come when you shall desire to see one of the days of the Son of Man, and you shall not see it. But they shall say to you, see here, see there, but don't go after them, and don't follow them. Now, isn't that a good word? &gt;&gt; I've heard that very thing. See here, see there, see here. Don't Don't Why you believe what you believe? See here, see right there. See here. Why do you believe what you believe? But Jesus said, don't follow after them. He said, see, because I must suffer many things, the son of man would be rejected in this generation. He said, but as it was in the days of Noah, so shall it also be in the days of the son of man. &gt;&gt; See, in this age, they will reject truth. I know it's quiet here this morning, but the devil wants he he don't like it whenever you come getting on his toes. But this is the age that they will reject truth. This is the age where the spirit would come in to to not be a open heart and to be able to receive the truth of the word. But Jesus said, "But even thus shall be in the day when the son of man is revealed." And brother Bram actually takes this scripture and he ties it to Apostle Paul and in in second Timothy he said as Janice and Jammers withtood Moses the anointed word of the hour so will these men not man but so will these men these anointed ones they will come and resist truth you say what day will they resist truth but Ram said they will resist it in the very day when the son of man is revealed so they hadn't all through these ages resisted this this was reserved for a time Their appearing was reserved for a time of exodus. The day when the son of man would be revealed. You say, "Well, when is that going to be?" Well, Revelations 10:7 tells us, in the days of the voice of the seventh angel, that was the messenger that God would send in this age, when he shall begin to sound. The mystery of God should be finished as he hath declared unto his servants of prophets. But said, see, the seventh angel's message, which was the opening of the seals, that was the seventh angel's message. I know a lot of people get this mixed up because when they read Luke 17:30 and they read Revelations 10:7 and they realize that the that the messenger is going to come and and the son of man is going to be revealed that many have made the messenger the son of man. But let me just make this plain this morning. The messenger was not the son of man. The the prophet of God was not the son of man. He he in no way the angel matter of fact the Bible would tell you the angel is not the son of man. The messenger was just there to reveal the son of man. But said, "People can't get it separated." He said, "But but that's what seems to be so hard." He said, "But he was not the son of man himself, the messenger. He wasn't the son of man, the the seventh angel. He was a messenger, but he was revealing the son of man to the public. So here his purpose was to come and bring what was private and reveal it in the public, the presence of the son of man. No wonder this was no wonder that this would bring about the spirit of Janice and Jambers. What did Moses do when he went down into Egypt? He didn't go into the private chambers of Pharaoh, but he went into Pharaoh's court and he said, "I demand that you let God's children go." It's a time of Exodus. They're going into a land. God has called them into this place of worship. And Pharaoh called I don't think it was a quiet thing. I don't think it was a little secret thing, but the Bible says Pharaoh called his great sorcerers and his magicians through the land of Egypt. Then he brought them into his core. It was a very very public act that God was performing in the land of Egypt. And they would come and try to withstand what God is doing. Even even down even down when Moses was up on Mount Si, it was a public thing to bring a golden calf down before the children of Israel to discredit what God was doing through the hand of Moses. So we [snorts] realize he said he was revealing the public to the son of man to the public. And in the day that Janice and Jambers will withstand the anointed ones, them make believers, unbelievers, those church formal, the Pentecostals that stand up against it because he said, "But let them alone because their folly will be made manifest soon. So go ahead and let them alone." Let me let me just let me just lay this out here this morning. Do you realize that this Pentecostal denomination had been formed in the age that we lived in? It didn't exist back in in in in the 1800s. This is is something that has take place in our age. The the the very age the Leodysian age uh that when the angel would come and sound this church this church age has become a denomination just like every other church age became a denomination. Uh in Roman Catholicism what happened when Martin Luther came to preach? Martin Luther came to rebuke the Catholic and then the ca then what what did they do? They turned into an organization and then John Wesley came and he rebuked the Lutheran and then they turned into an organization. And notice when the outpouring of the Holy Ghost came on Isuza Street and then and then all of a sudden it turned into a denomination. What did the prophet of God do in this age? But he turned and he rebuked Pentecostalism just like Martin Luther rebuked the Catholic and just like John. This isn't a new thing. It's God's servant that he would send in his age to call the people of God back to the word of God to to keep the folly of men. It's to call us away from an organization and back to the true word of God. It's a rebuke of Pentecostalism and denominationalism and being led by men. Don't you realize it's such a twist that Satan has put upon the message of the hour to call, you know, to call you men followers and the reality. It's the word of God. Isn't that what they were called in the days of Moses? You mean you'd go out there in a wilderness and follow after a man that's packing a stick? You're such a man follower, follow after Moses and Aaron. But friends, isn't it such a twist that God would come in this age to keep people from following after men and then the devil would come right behind him, that little spirit of Janice and Jammers, and sneak into home and saying they're just men followers and and they're following after a man. But the reality is they're following after the pillar of fire that came in the wilderness, the pillar of fire that was present in Pharaoh's court, the pillar of fire that led them down to the to the bank of the Red Sea. And that same pillar of fire has been present in this age. &gt;&gt; So the pillar of fire is purpose was to come and to call us away from following after men and men's religion and men's denomination that you you can't you know I I know what they say. I'm just I'm just giving you some good teaching this morning. But I know what they say. Well, you can't find this name in the Bible. You can't find not one denomination name in the Bible except for millions of people today still follow after men and religions that men have built. But God has called the people of God away from that and back to the true word of God. He says, but notice he said here, come out of this organization. But the very day when this messenger, not when he starts his message, but the very day when he begins to declare his message, not when he first came on the scene, but when he be, let me resay that, but when he begin to declare his message. See, the first pull was healing. The second pull was prophesying. The third pull was the opening of the word or the mysteries of God being revealed. In other words, when the third when when the third pull of of this messenger's message came, here would come the opening of the word. Here the seals would be open. The mystery uh would no longer be a mystery. The things of God that have been hidden all along would be brought out in this age. But notice as it would come, that is when this spirit becomes present. &gt;&gt; It wasn't there for healing. It wasn't trying to disprove uh disprove in that way. But he said here, notice when he would come, right, when the mysteries would be revealed in the opening of the word. But let me tell you, it was just like it was in the days of Moses. How's a mystery ever revealed? There's never been a mystery of God that was revealed that wasn't done from a mouth of a prophet. &gt;&gt; But he was revealed in the in this in this day in it was a prophet. The third brother said, "Remember this. There's no higher order than a word from the pro than the prophet." And remember the third pull was the opening of them seven seals to reveal the hidden truth that had been sealed in the word. And it is then in that day when this thing is to take place that Janice and Jambers the impersonators will appear again just like they did when Moses appeared with the original word to say it. They appear to impersonate it. That's exactly right. The very thing you see in Matthew 24:24, they're anointed ones. They're anointed in this age to do that very thing. Friends, you don't have to go very far in history to look back and see that that ain't exactly the truth. When p when the when the when the spirit of God fell on Isuzua Street, there was a great Pentecostal revival. It didn't take very long. There was the great healing campaigns, a great move of God, a move of the Holy Ghost across this nation. But it didn't take long when the word begins to be revealed. And here, God would bring a prophet up among all of these people. and he would begin to reveal the word of God and open up the the seals that had been hidden, the mystery that had been hidden. You'll notice that as the spirit of God would leave out of that what was called that great move of God, that great Holy Ghost move. I don't know if you ever been to one of them churches, but it makes you sick at your stomach to go to some Pentecostal denomination today. And what I I I'm not talking about your friends, but of course because we're not talking about the people, but but the spirit that that that they're under, but to sit and beat somebody on the chin and try to create a speaking in tongues and to shake somebody and try to make them speak in tongues and and what are they doing is trying to impersonate the Holy Ghost. It's the very spirit that Paul spoke of in this age of people that would come and they'll rank up a crank up a bunch of music and go out screaming out and t holling to the top of their lungs and you know you know they're there people practicing divine healing. They're they're hollering to the top of their lungs and demanding God to do things and and it don't move God at all. Brother said I went to a meeting one time they had old fell in a sheet. They were shaking him back and forth and then the then the guy come up had rheumatism and they just slapped him as hard as they could and said, "I hate rheumatism." He said, "But that don't never take devils out. You can shake them how hard you want to. You can push them down. You can pick them up. You can bite them on the chin. You can push them down by their head. All of the folly that men does across the world and call it the Holy Ghost. But I can tell you what a prophet said. He said, "The devil don't care how much you holler cuz the devil ain't hard to hear anyway." He said, "But the only thing that'll move the devil is faith because he knows where faith lays. And if you'll ever find a real true believer or a real true son or daughter of God that has the faith of God in their heart, that's the only thing that'll make the devil move. They're carnal impersonators in this world. Impersonating the move of God and impersonate the Holy Ghost. And then when people see the real thing, they can't even hardly believe it because the impersonation has taken over the world. It has taken over the world to create atmospheres and create worship centers and atmospheres that looks like God. But don't you realize that that that many today, Can you imagine if somebody came in the church this morning that had nails scars in his hands and and and and and sandals on his feet and had a had a long beard and says, "I am the Lord." Well, you wouldn't believe it because any hypocrite, any actor could do that very thing. But brother Bam said, "But what we're looking for is the life that he had." He said because his body sitting on the right hand of the majesty and when he comes there will be no time any longer when his body returns to the earth. He said but don't worry his spirit is still here and his life is giving evidence of him being here because he said in his word I'll be with you even in you even unto the end of the world. &gt;&gt; So we see in this age that we're living in that three things have been fulfilled. There's three things that lays right before the believer today. First thing is the world is in a solemn condition. How many recognizes that? &gt;&gt; I don't have to go through it. The world is in a solemn condition. It's perversion on every hand. It's open. It's public perversion. Matter of fact, you're ridiculed if you won't accept public perversion. That's how that's how much of a solemn condition that this world is in. Second thing in the in this hour is that the scripture that Janice and Jambus appears has been fulfilled. Here they are. That somebody say amen. &gt;&gt; I'm not the only person that hears that. I I'm not the only person that has heard that spirit come around say don't believe this and don't don't follow after it and you know other people had that same I'm not the only person that heard that I I know every one of you in the building's heard the same thing and so we recognize that the spirit of Janice and Jambers are or the same spirit that they had here it's operating today the third thing he said in the same it's the same hour that the son of man is to be revealed this is what brother Bam said recognize there's three things that are laying before you right now the world is in a sodom condition Jan Dennis and Jambers has appeared and it's the same hour that the son of man is to be revealed. Says, see, so there's your believer, your makebeliever, and your unbeliever. All three. There's a genuine word that's standing out there that's been vindicated. There's a makeel believer that's impersonating it. And there's an unbeliever there that's rejecting the whole thing. But I thank God this morning, brother Mark, that we've bypassed it. I thank God that there's a people that that that ain't just unbelievers and they ain't just make believers and we're not just impersonating something, but I thank God that there's some real truehearted believers that have got a hold of the word of God that they have saw by revelation and we bypass the creeds and and the things that men would take us into. Brother said what we need today, he said we need an opening of the word that lives. It ain't just something that God has spoken for a day gone by. It ain't just something that you can read about and be something of history. But I believe the opening of the word is something that has to be revealed to every heart that you can see the age that you live in that God has came down in this very age and he's made the son of man present. Why did he's do so many supernatural signs? It was to make the son of man known publicly among the people. I thank God. I wonder how many could lift your hand this morning and say, "I see it. God bless all seven of y'all. I see it. 9 10 11 12. We're getting more." I thank God that there's some people that have seen that public expression of the son of man being made known in this hour. He said, "See, what we need today is an opening of the word that lives." Now, you see, so what it does, the the opening of the word, it shouldn't put you down. It shouldn't make you defeated. It shouldn't make you come to church and just sit on your hands. The open a revelation is something that brings revival. And whenever you really see it, brother Mah, it changes who you are. The whole world, they can have anointed preachers and people just sit there and look at them. But not in this place. You know why? Cuz there's some anointed believers that saw the same thing the preacher saw that the son of man has been revealed in this age and they recognize the spirit of Janice and Jammer that would try to discredit and disprove and to push him aside. But brother David Paul, we're believers. So we stand on our feet and say, "I see your spirit in the Bible. I'm not discouraged that I can stand and I can go the next day." And the next day, just as God has ordained it in this age, I'm not discouraged by what the devil does because I see in the Bible it was prophesied he would do that very thing. &gt;&gt; He said, "We need a word, an opening of the word that lives." &gt;&gt; Said, "Well, why are there men like Janice and Jambers? Why are there false prophets and teachers teaching people away from the word? And why are they anointed to do that?" Let me tell you this. There's a reason why the devil don't want you to preach the opening of the word. He don't want you to preach that these seals have been revealed that this is an open book. Let me go ahead and tell you. I'm going to tell you something good. But let me tell you why he don't want you to preach it. I know what they say because I've heard them say, "Well, you know, we just preach Jesus." Now, don't be don't be getting into some other stuff. Because we just preach Jesus, you know, and we preach Jesus, too. Matter of fact, we preach the cross more than anybody I know. We I I believe in the preaching of the cross. And this in this church, we may as well make it known to the world. We believe the preaching of the cross of Calvary. I believe that it that it takes a man's sin and it buries him in the blood of Calvary. I believe that it sets people free. And I believe that it delivers them and it sets the captives free and everything that that that the cross would do. We believe in the preaching of the cross. But notice that whenever you hear or read about the preaching of the cross, you'll find the preaching of the cross in John's revelation. Revelation is the first chapter. You'll see the preaching of the cross. But you'll also find in Revelations the 5th chapter the opening of the word. Now watch happens. And in both both places it it's preached. Revelations 1 and5 it said, "And from Jesus Christ who is the faithful witness, the first begotten of the dead." I'm going to show you why the devil don't want you to preach the opening of the word. Jesus Christ who is a faithful witness, the first begotten of the dead, the prince of the kings of the earth. Unto him that loved us and washed us and which means loosed us from our sins by his own blood. Is that not the message of the cross? unto him that loved us and washed us by his own blood. He loosed us from our sins. That's the preaching of the cross. And listen what John said it done. And he hath made us kings and priests unto God and his father. And to him be glory and dominion forever and ever. That's Revelations 16. I thought they had that scripture back there. But but unto him be glory and dominion forever and ever. So notice the preaching of the cross. He said it makes us kings and priests, but to him be glory and dominion. Now watch what Revelations 5 and N. It says, remember this is whenever the opening of the word or the the the the the found that was worthy to take the book and to loose the seals. The Bible says they sung a new song saying, "Thou art worthy to take the book and to open the seals thereof. For thou was slain and hast redeemed us to God by thy blood out of every kindred and every tongue and people and nation." And watch the very same words. And hath made us unto our gods, kings and priests. But here this next line is different. And now we shall reign upon the earth. So in Revelations 1, which was the preaching of the cross, it says to him be glory and dominion forever. But in Revelations 5, which was the opening of the word, it says, "And we shall reign upon the earth." So the preaching of the cross shows the dominion of Jesus Christ and his dominion over every believer and his dominion over sin, his dominion over sickness. But whenever you preach the preaching or the opening of the word of God, what it done, I tell you what my Bible said. My Bible said it brought it brought dominion unto the believer till they said we shall reign upon the earth. Let me tell you what it does this morning. The opening of the word brings dominion to the believer. It brings power to the believer that not just Jesus has power over the devil, but the believer that has received the opening. That's why brother Brandon must say we need an opening of the word that lives. I don't need one THAT'S DEAD. I DON'T need some dead god or some dead religion, but we need the word of God to be open in our heart that we could come alive in this day that the power of God would be manifested out of our life. Jesus ain't the only one who has power over the devils. But that son of God who the word has been revealed to has dominion upon this earth. We shall reign upon this earth. He has power over every devil. You have power over every sickness because of the blood that Jesus shed. But I'm just showing you what's been revealed in this hour. It ain't just going to Mary and calling upon an intercessor and oh Mary, sweet Mary, can you call upon Jesus and ask him that he could come and do me a favor? BUT IT AIN'T THAT any longer. But it's to bring the believer to their position in Christ. It's to bring the son of God to recognize who he is that he don't have to go beg and plead and talk and try and try to work things out with God to make something happen. But because he knows who he is and because he knows where he stands and the word has been revealed unto him. It positionally places the believer in his place over the devil. &gt;&gt; It gives you dominion upon the earth that he shall reign upon the earth. And friends, let me just tell you there was that that's where dominion is found is in the opening of the word. Can I ask you what ministry or what church or what denomination ever gave you dominion over the earth? &gt;&gt; Somebody answer me that what what what church ever gave you dominion? What what denomination ever give you dominion? That your dominion is not found in any of that. A matter of fact, according to the Bible, there ain't nothing outside of the message that God would speak through the mouth of a seventh church age messenger. Revelations 5. There ain't nothing that would ever There ain't nothing that would bring dominion to the church outside of that. &gt;&gt; It's what puts you in your place and it's what puts the devil in his. &gt;&gt; Amen. It's what? There's a reason why you had to catch a revelation. This word has been open to you. &gt;&gt; It was open to place you in your position in God that you don't that you're not just a a church member. You're not just going to some church or whichever one makes you feel good. There there's a real revelation. And there's a reason why God done the the the the supernatural signs in the presence of the people. It was to call it was to attract people to uh to the to the the presence of the son of man. What was about to be revealed. But you watch his first coming. Brother Mark, you notice it was written in the scriptures. He came. You know what happened? Most people missed him. You know why? Because they were looking for the wrong thing. &gt;&gt; The religious world, they overlooked his first coming because they were looking for some great big thing in the sky. But there was a little woman that was going down to a well one day and all she was looking for was a refreshing. She was going down for a little refreshment. But she came to the well and she met Jesus there. And when she met Jesus, he said he began to discern her heart. And that one little sign of discernment was enough for her to say, "I know that when the Messiah comes, he would do these things. Don't let that spirit of Janice and Jambers take that away from you. I know. I I said, "Don't let that spirit of I I know I'm fighting against it this morning because I can feel it fighting back." But he's a liar. It's a devil out of the pits of hell that would try to take your faith away from the message of the hour that God has sending. THERE AIN'T NOTHING ELSE THAT brings dominion over the devil outside of this message that God has sent in this hour. I'm reading it to you right out of my own Bible. Somebody ought to say, "Amen." You preachers ought to say, "Y'all help me out a little bit this morning." If you don't believe it, well, then what are you doing in THIS CHURCH? THAT'S WHAT WE BELIEVE THIS MORNING. And I believe that God has came in this hour and he brought a message to his children. And I thank God that we have a we have a right to speak it to our children that that they would be able to understand WHAT GOD IS DOING. That we're not just coming and having some religion and making up some religion for people to follow after or some church for people to follow after. But this is the word of the Lord. &gt;&gt; IF GOD EVER SPOKE A WORD THAT YOU EVER BELIEVE, it's a word of the Lord. It's been vindicated in this hour &gt;&gt; to be the truth of God's word. They always overlook his coming. They overlooked his coming. But it took a little woman. She said when the Messiah comes, he would do these things. When she seen the sign of the supernatural, I thought, "Isn't that something?" All she seen was a sign of a supernatural. One little sign and that's all it took. And you know where she went with it? She went right and said, "When the Messiah comes, won't he do those things?" Today, when people see a sign of the supernatural, what do they do? Because they're unbelievers, they say, "Well, I don't believe that." And you know, I think that was that was this. And you know, I'm not so sure about that. When they see the sign of a supernatural, it causes all kinds of thoughts to come to all kinds of people. But look what kind of thought it brought to the woman at the well because she was predestinated of God to be a believer. She was looking for the sign of his coming. She cared about the prophecies of the age she was living in. She studied on it. She had heard about it. She knew about it. And when she met him AND SHE SAW THAT IT took place, she said, "This is the the very thing that the Messiah would do whenever he came." I wonder how many today that have been taught, right? That have been raised up, right? To look for the sign of the age that they live in and looking for the sign of his coming. We're not looking for a Jesus on a cloud. We're not looking for a great big 100 foot tall Jesus. We're not looking for him to be born in a manger. We're not looking, but we're looking for the right sign. And we're looking in the age that we're living in, the prophets that are that are concerning our age, the very scriptures that a denominational church won't even preach because they don't understand it. But the believer is looking for that very thing to come to pass. And that's why you see it and they don't &gt;&gt; because you're looking for that scripture to come to pass. So when you see something that fulfills that scripture that you're looking to come to pass there, your eyes come open and you say, "I see it. I've been looking for that. Didn't the Messiah, it don't take a great big thing. You know what it took, Sister Destiny? It took one little sign in front of that woman to cause her to go into town and say, "Come see a man that told me all that I've ever done." It don't take a great big move of God. It don't take a great big sign to take the bride of Jesus Christ and cause her to be a believer because she's watching for it. She's looking for it. And Satan is doing everything he can to try to keep her from seeing it. But she's watching for the sign of his coming. I know many has missed it, but let me tell you who hadn't missed it. That little woman at the well didn't miss it. And this little woman here today didn't miss it either. When she saw the sign of his coming, she knew how it would be. She knew how it was prophesied. And when she saw it, she went forth saying, "Come and see a man that knew everything that I ever done." I tell you what it was. It was a public revealing of the son of man in this age. He wasn't preaching to to to build up a name. He wasn't preaching to build up a ministry. He wasn't preaching to build up a following. He wasn't preaching to build up a prophet. He was preaching to make known the public who the son of man was. That in this age, in this Exodus age, the only thing that could ever lead you out of this world or age of Leoa into a rapture, it would come through the message of the hour. &gt;&gt; But thank God that there are some witnesses that saw it. &gt;&gt; So, Satan's trying to do everything he can to keep you from seeing it. He keeps you from seeing the true revelation of the faith of God's word being revealed and vindicated today. He said, "How does he do it?" By teaching it out of you &gt;&gt; by schools and libraries and literature and hospitals. Said he's trying to teach it out of people. He said he'll do anything so that you won't look at that and see that it's Jesus Christ. &gt;&gt; Isn't that a powerful statement? He'll do he'll call it anything. Said because he knows it. That's what the Bible said. In the beginning was the word. The word was with God. The word was God. The word was made flesh and dwelt among us. You see, so the very and same thing that happened when Jesus was here. Anything to say that it wasn't God. &gt;&gt; Same thing today. Anything to say that it wasn't Jesus Christ. He said he'll cause you to look at anything to say so that you will look at that and not think it was Jesus Christ. He said, but he's the word. And in this age, he said that this would take place in this age. And now here it is happening. How many say amen? &gt;&gt; Now here it is happening. He's trying his best to keep you from seeing that. And how how will he do it? Said he'll tack every dirty name onto it he can. He'll call him holy rollers, call them everything else. He called Jesus be elabub. He said, "Why?" Because Satan's trying to keep you from seeing the real meaning of the message of the hour. He's trying to keep you from seeing the real meaning of the word. He said, "Well, what does the word mean?" He said, "It means that it's the time the exodus is at hand. The word for this age, the evening light being interpreted, the mysteries being revealed in this age is for one purpose. It's to prove to the church that the exodus is at hand. &gt;&gt; It's to make preparation in the hearts of the believers. &gt;&gt; It's to make you ready for a rapture. You know, maybe maybe you look at it and you don't see that, but you know, sometimes you have to look at something more than once in order to see it. &gt;&gt; Remember what happened to Ahab and or or Elijah in the days of Ahab? They they they they they came down. He said, "I hear the sound of an abundance of rain. There had been a great famine in the land." But but Elijah told the his servant, he said, "Go out and look towards the sea." He said, he said, "Look toward the sea and come back and tell me what you see." And he came back and he said, "I don't see nothing." He said, "But I heard the sound of an abundance of rain." Now, he's going back and he's looking for a vindication of it. He went back again the second time, Brother Mark. He came back. He said, "What did you see?" I didn't see nothing. He went back again the third time. He said, "What did you see?" "I didn't see nothing." Went back the fourth time. It took seven times for him going out and looking to the sea. Before he came back, he said, "I see a cloud the size of a man's hand." I thought, "Isn't this powerful that in the middle of a drought, he was looking for a supernatural sign." Isn't that where we are in the middle of a spiritual drought, in the middle of Leoa, when the very spirit of God, it seemed to be pressed down and everything is fake and every everything's phony and an impersonation. But in the middle of all that spiritual drought, he was looking for a sign. He was looking for something, some kind of supernatural sign. And let me tell you what he done when he came in there to Elijah and he said, "I see a cloud the size of a man's hand." But said, "You notice what he done? He accepted the first little move that he saw." He said, "But it wasn't it didn't take much. It was just a little bit of a move." He said, "That's enough to make me a believer." You know what unbelief says? The unbeliever says, "I need a bigger sign." The unbeliever says, "I need more proof." The unbeliever says, "I need more prophecy." That one little prophecy ain't enough. I need you to show me more. I need something else. I need something else. I need something else. Because it's a spirit of unbelief. He said, but the believer, notice what Ahab or Elijah done when he saw that, he accepted the first little move and accepted it to be God. Oh, I thank God what he what he done. You know why? Because he said whenever he saw it, he knew the only thing that could cause rain to come in the drought, it would be the hand of God to do it. And when he came in and said, "I see the I see the size of a man's hand." He said that's what it would take anyway. It'll take the hand of God to bring rain. And he accepted that little move. And brother Bam said when you see if you when you come this morning, he said they get all scooped up the spirit of God. May it open your eyes this morning that when you would come back and not believe creeds instead of the word, but come back to the word and just see the first little move of God and let your faith accept it. He said, "We're looking for the coming of the Lord." We look at the Holy Ghost followed in the last days. We look at signs and wonders. We watch what's taking place. See, don't you see what you're looking at? That's exactly what God said would take place. So, let your faith grab it and say, "I want it, too." &gt;&gt; I wonder how many this morning you can stand to your feet as the music players come. I wonder how many this morning that could be like be like Elijah was that day and let your faith grab it and say, "I want it, too." It didn't take some great big move. It don't Everybody's looking for a great move. They're looking for the church to be shouting all over the building to to recognize that God's in their midst or or or they're they're looking for some something. It's got to be lifted up by music or all these things to to recognize God is in your midst. He said, "But all they did was took the first move." &gt;&gt; One little thing and he got a hold of it. Let me tell you where he went. He said, "Get a hold of it by faith." Let your faith &gt;&gt; get a f hold of the first little move. &gt;&gt; I watched that young lady right there just come into our tent meeting here a few days ago. Never heard nothing about this message. About a month ago, she came into the meeting. She walked right in there and seen a little bit of move of God. She sat on my couch and testified. She don't mind if I tell her testimony. She sat on my couch and testified, "I've been looking for something that was real." &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And she saw a move of God and accepted one little move to be the word of the Lord. [applause] And don't you think that that spirit that Paul prophesied of isn't following her around &gt;&gt; just like it follows you? Don't believe this. Don't believe that. Don't follow this. Anointed. Paul said men. Men that would lead astray silly women. False prophets. What Jesus called them. False Christ and false prophets that would arise in this age. Let me tell you, Elijah took a hold of that little move of God. The Bible said he ran. He got so inspired that he ran before Ahab to the entrance of Jezrael. took him. It put a revival in his heart. Brother Mark, he ran. But remember said, "Take it by faith. Take that little move of God that God gave you by faith and accepted to be the Lord." &gt;&gt; Now, when you accept it to be the Lord, see what God does with it. &gt;&gt; Talking about changing somebody's life. &gt;&gt; Accept a little that little move to be God &gt;&gt; and see what God does with the life. Said just take it by faith and run with it. &gt;&gt; Isn't it something Elijah, he went down to Jezrael? How many knows what Jezel means? It's the valley of sewing. The name Jezrael. This is where Elijah runs to. I thought, isn't that something? Because Boam said, "Let be like Elijah and take your faith and get a hold of it and just run like Elijah ran." I thought something. If we could take a take a hold of that little move of God by faith and run like Elijah down into Jezrael into the valley of Sen [music] and plant that little seed of faith. Think about where we're going. Isn't that what Jesus said? If you had the faith that was a grain of a mustard seed, you could say to this mountain, "Remove and it shall remove and nothing shall be impossible to you." It wasn't a great big seed. It was the smallest seed there was. But when you get a hold of it and you can take it into the valley of sewing, a little move of God by faith, and you could take it by the mark and plant it in your life, and all of a sudden it begins to grow something greater. You may not understand it all. You may not understand all the mysteries of God being revealed. You [music] may listen to the seven seal 10 times and you may you may not see it all. You may not understand everything the prophet says, but [music] don't don't just because you don't understand something or don't see it or didn't see it the first time that you heard it. Don't let Janice and Jambers come in and rob you of it. &gt;&gt; Just keep going back until you see it. Go back to the sea and look toward the sea. This is the best advice I could give you this morning. Just keep going back, oh servant, and look towards the sea and tell me what you see. [music] It may take seven times to going back and seeing it before you come and all of a sudden you realize revelation comes [music] through your whole life. I honestly believe this. I still believe that the day that the Lord comes that we'll still be getting revelation. I believe that. I believe we'll still have trouble. We'll still have trials. We'll be mad at the job wishing we didn't have to go back to work tomorrow. The very day that he comes, we'll still be going through that. There ain't no there's no there's no premillennial millennium in the natural. Y'all understand what I'm saying there? We're still in the flesh. We're still going to battle the flesh. We're We're still going to go through these things. We're still getting revelation. We're still growing in the word. You're still the day the Lord comes, there'll be many that rapture from this earth that in their heart think that they ain't even far enough along with God to go in a rapture. I really believe that. There'll be many that will go in a rapture. They think, you know, I don't understand this. I don't see everything. And then there'll be many that think they know everything, they'll never even go. I'm just telling you. But as a believer, just keep going back and looking. And then when you see a little move of God, take it and plant it. Go back and look some more. Get another seed of faith and come back to the valley of sewing and plant it again. Before long, you'll have a garden of things that [music] have been planted in your life that that it don't matter what kind of spirit would come in. remember the mark to to try to discredit or to push you out of it. Say, you know what? I'm right where God wanted me to be this morning. I'm right where God called me. This ain't it ain't some madeup thing. I'm right where God I've seen God God's changed my life with this message. He's changed my my heart. He saved my family. He [music] it ain't separate from the cross. It's because of the cross that we have this this morning. It's because of the cross I can preach this message this morning to bring dominion to the church. So it don't take a great move when Mark was talking about Charles and Vanna, a little testimony or something that happened in their house. I don't even remember what he was talking about, but something that happened at their house, but it was something that was big enough in their home that was just some little move of God that was enough to bring faith. David Paul praying about something talking to his wife about it in the car and come in the house of God [music] and the Lord began to speak on it and go out the next day at the job and the very thing that God was speaking to him about he manifested right in front of them may not be a great thing to the world but they accepted the little move of God and they planted it in their valley of sewing and look what it's bringing to pass the life that is that is that is following the word of God that that that God is growing in I I've seen so much growth in that young man. Well, I I couldn't be any prouder than to see what God is doing in his and his wife's life few years ago. And they just just that Satan would do anything he can just [music] to struggle to keep him from from being here. But I watched him. I watched whenever God got a hold of him. I watched when God got a hold of her. And it's a supernatural thing. This ain't something that you can discredit. Listen, Janice and Jambers. It ain't something you can discredit. It's a real thing. This is a supernatural thing that took place in their life. It may not be some great big thing to the world, but it's supernatural. Took place in that young lady's life that caused her to want to serve God. Many here that none hundreds that have been saved just from the time that we've had our little church. Hundreds that have been baptized. men going out and serving the Lord and winning souls and witnessing and baptizing them in lakes and rivers and ponds and churches wherever wherever they'll wherever they'll let us baptize them, trying to win souls to the kingdom of God. And allow people to see something that's real. That's what I want you to see this morning. Don't be discouraged about the things that are going on around you, for they were prophesied that they would [music] take place. be like Moses and Aaron and just go in the next day and say, "But they're fulfilling prophecy." I knew it would take place in this age. It's a fulfillment of prophecy, but I won't be led astray. I won't be led aside. I I see that spirit as it moves into homes [music] and into people's living rooms. And isn't it something? He said they would go into homes and [music] lead captive silly women that could be led astray. But friends, I've got news for you. Just because you read that, don't you don't say you're a silly woman. We're not silly women. &gt;&gt; There may be a world full of silly women, but you're not a silly woman. You're a daughter of God. You're a son of God. And so that isn't it something? But the Bible never says that that spirit could lead astray the son of God or the daughter of God. It never led them anywhere. Why? Because they recognized what it was &gt;&gt; and they were able to withstand it because it was prophesied in this age. Friends, let me tell you this morning. He said just take what God gives you little bit at a time. Said Elijah kept believing. He said I hear the sound of an abundance of rain and that little cloud before long it became two clouds. Two clouds became a hill and a hill become a mountain and the mountain became another mountain. And first thing you know the whole skies were thundering and rain was following because he accepted what God sent. Isn't it something just to accept what God sent &gt;&gt; and to accept you be talking about something that'll settle your life. When you accept what God sent and accept where God sent you, it settles your life. All the confusion and unsettlness, not know where to go and what to do. When you can when you can just accept it that God brought me here. I may not know my purpose. I may not know exactly why sometime I I'm trying to find but I know that God brought me to this place. And then when you can accept that, then allow God to start working on your life. But said when he accepted it, he said his his life must have been renewed. When he accepted it as a move of God, said it just took a first move. I know of people today, they're looking for great big things. But can I just leave you with this this morning? It don't take a great big thing to a believer to accept it as being God. That's something that's been built up in people's minds. that that that it takes a certain a certain thing and to happen in order for it to be God. But that's not true. It don't always take a great big thing. And the devil knows it. And so he he brings little bitty things into our life to try to to try little bitty thoughts, little bitty seeds that are planted. Why? He's trying to upset the garden that God's growing. He's trying to plant other seeds in the garden that God's growing. He throws things out there, but you know what? They'll never take root. Isn't that true? Because this seed that God put, it won't be mixed with nothing else. They'll never take root. He may be trying to grow things up in your life, but it's artificial. It's fake. It won't be there very long. You just keep going back and taking every little move of God except the little thing. Don't miss the little things that God does. Don't miss little things that God does in your life. Little little signs that God does in your life. Little because [music] he's he's leading us and and he never he never neglects his children. You know, there was a great there was a great battle one time, a great war that was lost because of the tiniest of things. There was a [music] you remember the old proverb that was written about it. Remember they went in and they had sent a a rider with a message and said, "Go in there and they sent with the king's message and said this is uh what we have to do to win the battle." And so but but because the the rider went in and he wasn't able to make it to the battle because the horse threw its shoe and he wasn't able to make it to the battle. They wound up losing the war. When they wrote the proverb about it, they said, "For the want of a nail, a shoe was lost." See, it was a little thing. And for the one of a shoe, then a horse was lost. And for the one of a horse, a rider was lost. And for the one of a rider, the message was lost. And for the one of a message, the battle was lost. And for the one of a battle, the war was lost. Just one little thing. So, we don't want to miss it. We don't want to miss the little things that God [music] does or that God brings to us or or to overlook it. Isn't it something? A whole entire war was lost because somebody overlooked a nail in a horse's shoe. I thought, "But Lord, don't let me overlook the spirit in this age. Don't don't let me miss something great. Don't let me lose the battle and miss something great because of some little thing that I that I would overlook that the devil would try to to bring me past. But but I accept it. I accept it as a move of God. How many raise your hands this morning and say that I I accept this message as a move of God. I it wasn't even just a little thing. It was such a great big thing, but God just keeps reindicating it. Isn't it something that he does that? You know what that is? Can I tell you God don't have to do that, but it's the mercy of God that he vindicates that to your life. Brother David Paul, what happened to you at your work? That's just God's mercy that he would vindicate that in your life in such a way. It's his mercy. Why? Because he's trying to establish the faith of his children in this hour, in the age where there's such a pressure to cause you to disbelieve the word of God. But I just want to encourage you this morning, even the little things, don't over don't overlook what God does. Amen. You love the Lord this morning. How many can say he's worthy of it all? You're worthy of it all. You're worthy of it all. [music] For from you are all things. To you are all [singing and music] things. You deserve the glory. You're [singing and music] worthy of it all.
