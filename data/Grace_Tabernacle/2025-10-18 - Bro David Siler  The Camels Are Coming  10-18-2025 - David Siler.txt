He just stopped being able to walk and he crawled on his arms into the emergency room until I could meet him there and they found a tumor above his kidney and we had no clue it was there. They said they would have never found it. And we went a couple weeks later and we found out that that was not just a tumor, but it was a type of cancer tumor called a fiochromocyto and that it needed to come out right away and there was a problem with that because I was scheduled exactly one week later for brain surgery. So I went ahead and had my brain surgery and we had one failed surgery attempt. He was on 26 pills a day to keep him alive. We went in for surgery. They were able to remove the tumor and then he died on us three times. And I told the Lord, I said, "If you will let me keep my very best friend, I promise I will testify of your goodness and your grace." And they told us there was no chance of it being cancerous. They said, "Out of the one in a million, only one in 10 are everice was diagnosed with a 10 million type of cancer. So rare nobody in the United States had ever treated it on a live person. But here we are nine months later. He's passed his first scan. The cancer cells that were left behind are not growing. And we go in just a few weeks for another six month scan.

And certainly appreciate all that God has already done and been such a tremendous meeting thus far. and started there with brother Andrew and just made a great just a great call to the faith of the believers and brother Jonathan right behind him and then brother Wayne last night and had a wonderful message about the great high priest that could be touched by the feeling of our infirmities.

So, any uh any needs tonight, won't you just lift your hand to the Lord? And I know we have testimonies from last night already and heard the sister giving a testimony about what God had done for her family a while ago. And so I I know God is certainly more than able. So why don't we just ask him to come? If you have a need on your heart and and uh just just trust the Lord. Brother Seth, would you pray over these requests for us tonight? [Music] Lord, we love you. Lord, we thank you for what you're doing for us, Lord, in these services. Lord, we ask that you go, Father, Lord, to each and every need, Lord, to each and every individual, Lord.

Lord, those that are sick and body, Lord, we ask that you touch them, Father. Lord, heal their body, Lord. Lord, and let it be a testimony, Father. And Lord, we ask, Father, Lord, as a minister comes out this evening, Lord, that you just move him out of the way, Father. And Lord, allow us, Father, as a congregation, Lord, to move ourselves out of the way, Lord, that we can pull from the gift of God, Lord. And we ask that you keep us in your perfect will, Lord, in this service now. We ask these things in the name of Jesus Christ. Amen. Amen. How many's ready to hear the word? Amen. I said, "How many's ready to hear the word?" Amen. You know, while we come, we love the word of God. Come out in the middle of a storm and rain and because we love to be fed by the word of God. And and we got to be indoors. So, we thank God for that. Amen. And if we staying out there, we'd be singing, "Wait in the water." But we're in here and we're going to wait in another kind of water.

Lord, we are so honored to be able to be here this evening. There's just something about your people when they gather together and we come together, Lord, believers and believing your word. And there's something about Lord that whenever believers get together, Lord, there there's a great atmosphere that Lord is a make you welcome to come to take the utmost seat in this place tonight. And Lord, we've come, Lord, not to even hear from ma'am, but we come to hear from you. knowing, Lord, that when you come by, you never disappoint. Great things always take place when you come by. So, we're looking to you tonight, Lord. And Father, may your presence never grow common to us. But Lord, I ask that, Lord, that we could just fall deeper in love with you, deeper than what we ever have. And we look to you tonight, Lord, ask that you would just move amongst us, Lord. That you would just take your Lord, as it was, the bread of life. May you break it, I pray, Lord. Lord, that whenever you was walking down the road and Lord, after the resurrection, Lord, I hear the prophet say, you stopped at that little restaurant and you went inside and it was the way that you took the bread into your hands and as you begin to break the bread, as you'd done many times before, the Bible said their eyes come open. So, we ask tonight, Lord, take the bread into your hands. break it to us tonight, Lord, and we'll be so careful to give you the praise in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ. And everybody said, "Amen." Amen. God bless you this evening. So honored to be with you in the house of the Lord tonight. And and we are we are grateful to be able to be to be in here. Um, but you know, I got to thinking about this in the back room that at one time the tent in the tabernacle in the wilderness was a great thing. But they finally went from the tent over into the temple. And so we've just made a great transition. &gt;&gt; You don't even know it, but you've been in a dispositional change. And so we're glad to be in the house of the Lord. The rain may come, but it don't stop us. We'll just keep right on going. Amen. God bless you. We want to say certainly appreciate brother Matt allowing us to come to be a part of the meeting. I just love brother Matt and appreciate him so much and we've been buddies for for many of years and and so we're not not just family but real friends and I certainly appreciate what the Lord has done here in this place and how that the the Lord is just well he does great things and u you know the prophet said that one man in the hand of God all God needs is one person &gt;&gt; and look what God can do and so we want to say we appreciate him and also I would like to recognize his wife sister Sarah um I I know that it's not an easy job because being a pastor's wife and bear he bears a load and she's going to bear the load. And we want to say God bless you. Thank you for all your efforts and the struggles and I know how it is. You worry about making sure the meeting's right and everything is is going to be taken care of and uh and you just wanted to go off without a hitch and and you've done that. You've accomplished it. We want to say how much we appreciate you, Sister Sarah and brother Matt. Amen. Uh, I'm honored to be one of the ministers to be able to come after hearing everything we heard last night. I thought we just thought, well, they preached everything there is to preach. Uh, so I thought we'd just kind of go back to the maps and go across them tonight in the back of the Bible. But let's go to the book of Genesis, chapter 24. Genesis chapter 24. We'd like to look at verse at verse 10. We'll just read down a few verses of scripture to give you this setting to get everybody on the same page for what we're going to speak on this evening. This is Genesis 24, of course, where um the servant Eleazar is going to get um a bride for Isaac and uh he's been commissioned to be able to go. And the Bible says, "And the servant took 10 camels of the camels of his master and he departed for all the goods of his master were in his hand. And he arose and went to Mesopotamia unto the city of Nahor. And he made his camels to kneel down without the city by a well of water at the time of the evening. And in the evening, listen this, even the time that women go out to draw water. And a woman of the scripture we know is a type of the church. So great things happen at Wales. And here he is in the evening time when the women go out to draw water. Verse 12. And he said, "Oh Lord, God of my master Abraham, I pray thee, send me good speed this day. Show me kindness unto my master Abraham." And behold, I stand here by the well of water. Listen to this servant's prayer. I stand here by the well of water, and the daughters of the men of the city come out to draw water. And I and let it come to pass. Let it come to pass that the damel to whom I shall say, now watch, it's going to run twofold. He's got to do his part, but she's got to do her part. &gt;&gt; The dames I shall say, let down thy picture, I pray thee, that I may drink. And she shall say, Amen. &gt;&gt; She's going to have to find her voice. &gt;&gt; And she shall say, drink. and I will give the camel&lt;unk&gt;s drink also. Let the same be she that thou hast appointed for thy servant Isaac, and thereby shall I know that thou hast showed kindness unto my master. And it came to pass before he had done speaking. Hallelujah. That behold, Rebecca came out, who was born to Bethl, son of Mila, the wife of Nahor, Abraham's brother, with her picture upon her shoulder. She's already got what she needs to fulfill the word. &gt;&gt; And the damsel was very fair to look upon and a virgin. Neither had any man known her. And she went up down to the well rather and filled her picture and came up. And the servant ran to meet her and said, "Let me, I pray thee, drink a little water of thy picture." And she said, "Who do you think you are?" And she said, "Drinkle, &gt;&gt; my Lord, &gt;&gt; and watch the Bible." She hastened. &gt;&gt; She's not trying to get slow and allowing things just to go. She hastened and let down her pitcher upon her hand and gave him drink. And when she had done giving him drink, she said, "I will draw water for thy camels also, until they are done drinking." And she hastened and emptied her pitch into the trough and ran again unto the well to draw water and drew for all his camels. I'd like to speak tonight. The Lord help us on the camels are coming. May the Lord add his blessings to the word. You can be seated. We know that the Old Testament is a shadow of the New. And we know that because of the way that God has pinned the word that God a lot of times when he wants to say something in the Old Testament that God will not just come right out and say what is on his mind. But remember when brother preached the message Christ the mystery of God revealed he said that God would actually hide it in the people's lives and he tells us when it comes to the story of redemption that the story of redemption is something that God has actually hid in the Old Testament. And we know that the mystery of every part of redemption truly lays in the Old Testament. And we know that things that is been spoken about in this day that's going to come to pass. Things that's going to actually be manifested in this day has actually been spoken about already in the Old Testament. You remember in the seventh seal that the prophet tells us, he says that the seventh seal is spoken all the way back into the book of Genesis. And he said, "If I had time to be able to go into it, I will show you how that the seventh seal is even spoken about plumbed back in the book of Genesis." So then the seventh seal, which we know the prophet tells us is the coming of the Lord. It's the rapture of the bride, was actually something that was spoken plumbed back into the book of Genesis. And brother tells us whenever you deal with Genesis, he says that Genesis is the seed book of the Bible. So whatever is upon the earth today has already been planted in the book of Genesis by the manifestation of seed that had went into the earth. So Genesis being the seed book of the Bible, we know that God actually swed the seed of the seventh seal all the way back in the book of Genesis. And God sold it at that time because he knew there would be a day that if the seed was going to be sowed into the field that there would come a day that there would be a manifestation of that seed which had been sold. And we believe that today because we are living in the hour of the harvest time that every biblical type, every shadow that was of the Old Testament has got to come to manifestation in the day that we're living in now. As a matter of fact, every scriptural type has got to be manifest in the day that we're living now. Because remember, there is no more ages to come. There's not going to be another age that's going to raise up and then another messenger and go back through the cycle of church ages. We have come to the climax, the claremont of everything that the Bible has talked about. We have made it to the finality of everything that God has promised. There is no more days to come. There is no Listen, there's not another hour to be able to wait and an hour to be able to play church and all. Oh, no. That time has come and gone. And I'll just remind you tonight, we are headed for the reign of the millennium. We are headed for the change of the body. And upon this earth, the Bible says there's going to be weeping and wailing and nashing of teeth. There is a decision that you're going to have to make. You cannot stay upon the earth. You cannot stay. Well, I'm a red-blooded American. You may be, but I want to tell you, you cannot remain in America because the last vision of America was in craters and ashes. You better get ready because you can't stay here. Wherever you go, you're not going to be able to stay here. It's because we're living in the harvest of all things. Now because it is the seed being sowed in the book of Genesis as we read it tonight out of the book of Genesis chapter 24 we know that Abraham's desire looking at Genesis 22 whenever God would come as brother Wayne rather last night said it so beautifully how that God would come and not only make a promise but then bring that promise to pass and we know that the desire that lay within within Abraham was to have a promised son by the name of Isaac and he wanted that son to have a bride. And we know that that is a scriptural time that God was foreshadowing the last days that there would be a bride in the end time. &gt;&gt; Amen. That there would be a people who would recognize their day. They would recognize the message. They would recognize the truth. They're not ashamed to say amen to it. They believe it with all of their heart. So God was actually writing the story of redemption in the life of Abraham. He wrote it in the life of Isaac. He wrote it in the life of Eleazar and he wrote it in the life of Rebecca. You believe that tonight? And we know that it is a mystery. And because it is a mystery, God's not going to come right out and tell Abraham. Abraham, let me tell you what you're doing. You're typing me. What you're doing, you're typing me. God doesn't tell Abraham that. He just leads Abraham. He directs Abraham and he hides the mystery of redemption in the man's life. So we can see the predestinated hand of God is actually in every part of this story that God has already spoken concerning many things that was going to come to pass in the day that we're living in now. And let me say this, we are living in that hour because not only is there a time to speak it, there's a time to manifest it. Do you realize the coming of Jesus, as brother Wayne brought it last night, the coming of Jesus was prophesied for 4,000 years. It was prophesied that Jesus would come and the Bible prophesied that a redeemer was going to come. He prophesied a resurrection was going to come. And then he prophesied there would be seven gentile ages that was going to come. And not only would there be seven gentile ages, there would be seven messengers of those ages which isn't prophesied in the scripture. But not only is the ages been prophesied about, but the people, Hallelujah, but the people that it makes up that age has been prophesied about it as well. And I want to say this, you've already been seen in the word. &gt;&gt; You've already been seen in the covenant. Your name has already been wrote in the book. And God is going to bring his word to pass. He don't ask you. He don't ask you what you think about it. He tells you what you're going to be. He said you're called. He didn't ask if you wanted to be. He said, "You're chosen. You're elected. You're predestinated." That's what God tells you. You don't tell God what you want to be. God tells you what you're going to be. &gt;&gt; We know when it comes to Genesis 22 that God had already spoken Abraham in his seed. And I know everybody has heard that that notice that God tells Abraham, he said, "You're going to have a seed. shall be the father of many nations. He's already promised that to Abraham. Amen. So, after 25 years, Abraham finally has his son. &gt;&gt; Amen. Wait a minute, brother David. I thought Abraham already had Ishmael. &gt;&gt; I want to tell you, Abraham was not the father of Ishmael. &gt;&gt; No, Abram was the father &gt;&gt; of Ishmael. Abraham, remember what God told him? Take thy son thine and only &gt;&gt; because Isaac was the only covenant son that was identified by God. Remember what Ishmael Ishmael was a product of the flesh of Abram. It was not a son concerning the promise. It was not the one that was foreseen by God. It was Isaac shall thy seed be called. &gt;&gt; Amen. Now, Abraham only had one covenant son, and that son is Isaac. And now that God is going to prophesy through Abraham's life that he wants Abraham to take this promised son. Amen. Follow me now. And he wants him to take that promised son. And he's told him to go on a threeday journey. So, he takes Isaac. They go on a three-day journey. And upon this journey, he finally comes to this mountain. And God tells him that this is the promised place where he's supposed to come to. And Abraham takes Isaac on top of the mountain and he goes there with everything in him. He's fixing to slay Isaac. He's going to kill Isaac. As a matter of fact, remember the prophet said he tied Isaac down and he was getting ready to sacrifice him. And God said,"Abraham, Abraham, steady your hand." God told Abraham one time to do it, but he had to tell him twice to stop. Father, that's the way I want to be. That God can lead it and say it one time. He ain't got to beg me. He ain't got to twist my arm. All he's got to do is tell me one time. And Lord, if you change your will, tell me twice to stop, Lord. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; So he tells him, Abraham, Abraham, steady your hand. And the Bible says, "And the angel of the Lord called unto Abraham, and he said, by myself have I sworn, because thou hast done this thing, and thou hast not withheld thy son, thine only son." &gt;&gt; So here is the father, &gt;&gt; and the father is willing to sacrifice his son. &gt;&gt; I'm talking about the mystery of redemption. &gt;&gt; He was willing to sacrifice his son. Now, catch it. Isaac on a three-day journey. He's going to be sacrificed. It's the type of the son of God, the Lord Jesus Christ, that was going to be upon the cross for three days. Amen. But then after the resurrection, all listen now. After the resurrection of Jesus Christ, something begins to happen. Now, God is going to fulfill the promise of Isaac's seed, which is bringing him a gentile bride. Now, notice what he tells Abraham after the resurrection type of Isaac. He begins to tell them, "I will bless thee. I will multiply thy seed as the stars that are in the heaven and the sand that's on the sea. And thy seed shall possess the gates of your enemy. He's already talking about the Isaac seed line that is going to be a conqueror. It's going to be an overcomer. &gt;&gt; He's not fought one battle, but he tells him what he is. He's not been won through one trial yet, but he tells him what he is. It's the same with you and I. Before you ever come to the earth, God has already declared it by his word that you was going to be a conqueror. He was going to be an overcomer this day. It's already been lived. &gt;&gt; And then God says something incredible. &gt;&gt; And in thy seed &gt;&gt; shall all the nations of the earthl, &gt;&gt; not just Jacob, &gt;&gt; not just the 12 tribes. &gt;&gt; I'm talking about the mystery of redemption. out of every nation, out of every kindred, out of every tongue, out of every people, all the nations of the earth shall be blessed. &gt;&gt; God is prophesying about the lineage of Abraham and he's declaring that you will be blessed and every nation will be blessed. &gt;&gt; Isn't that the promise after the resurrection of Jesus? &gt;&gt; Isn't that the same promise after the resurrection? Whenever the spirit of God come back on the day of Pentecost, and the Bible said, "This promise is unto you." &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; And to your children &gt;&gt; and to those that are far off, &gt;&gt; and as many as the Lord our God shall call. He did not limit it to a certain bloodline. He did not limit it to a certain lineage. It was not just to Jew. But this promise is unto you in the prophecy and to your children, those who are far Gentiles. God's spoken word is prophesying over the church and he's letting them know I made a promise. I made an oath within my word and I will fulfill what I have spoken. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Now, in order for God to do this, &gt;&gt; if he's going to be the type of the end time, death, burial, resurrection, &gt;&gt; promise of the Holy Ghost, &gt;&gt; then he can't stop with just Isaac resurrecting &gt;&gt; and he can't stop with just pronouncing blessings. &gt;&gt; But now Isaac the son &gt;&gt; has got to have a bride. Can you imagine in your Bible is the very story of your life that was wrote 6,000 years ago. Your identity inside Rebecca was already laying there. [Music] &gt;&gt; Oh my. &gt;&gt; Now the story of Abraham father is coming to an end. So it moves from father to son. It moves from one office to another, &gt;&gt; from one dispensation to another. &gt;&gt; Amen. And now you've come to the end of the book. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; So the whole story of Abraham in the physical from the old is now changing to the new. &gt;&gt; So Abraham is finishing. It's the end of the book. &gt;&gt; And at the finishing of the book or I'll say the fulfillment of the book, &gt;&gt; the father sends. Now watch. He sends his servant Eleazar to find a bride for his son Isaac. &gt;&gt; Amen. Now notice something here. After he reveals himself as Jehovah Gyra, after he provides himself &gt;&gt; a sacrifice, &gt;&gt; I'll say it a little bit slower in case you didn't catch what God told Abraham. I will provide my &gt;&gt; I will provide myself &gt;&gt; as a sacrifice. &gt;&gt; Now something happens. He tells him, "I'll multiply your seed." But the problem is he can't multiply it without the promised son. &gt;&gt; I'll just say it for you. There's no way there's going to be a multiplication of Gentiles outside of Isaac, the son of God. Because of Isaac, you and I are part of it. Because of Isaac, we come through the blood. Because of Isaac, Isaac, we've been poured into a royal sea line and a royal lineage. Because of Isaac, &gt;&gt; now watch what the Bible says. It's imperative that you catch this. The Bible said as soon as he leaves the mountain, he goes down to a place. And the Bible said he returned him and the young men and they rose up and went down to Beersa. And Abraham dwelt at Beeba. So after the resurrection, after the promise has been made, Abraham goes to Beeba. And the word Beersa means the well of the sevenfold oath. &gt;&gt; So after death, burial, resurrection, promised son coming on the scene, spirit of God being given, the next thing is seven seals. I mean, seven O's, seven promises of God down there at the well of Beha. Abraham goes down there to that well of the sevenfold. Let me just say, not a one seal well, not a five seal well, but a seven seal well. Amen. That's got seven seal promise from the start to the finish. &gt;&gt; And while he's at Beersa, &gt;&gt; Abraham left Haran many years ago. But while he's at this well, he hears something from &gt;&gt; Haran. &gt;&gt; He hears some He hears something from his kindred &gt;&gt; that he not the Bible doesn't record him ever hearing one thing before this. &gt;&gt; But he gets to this well and guess what? &gt;&gt; Here comes some good news. And the Bible said it was told, it was told unto Abraham, saying, "Behold, I don't want to bore you, but this is powerful. Behold, Mila, she had also borne children unto thy brother Nahor." So he receives word from the homeland that his family is producing a lineage &gt;&gt; and they're going to have offspring. &gt;&gt; All the years that has went by, he's not dealt with any of that, but he's fixing to. Did God tell him to leave there? He said, "Leave there. Get away from there. I'll go to a place that I will show you." He's not had anything to do with Gentiles, the homeland yet. But now something is about to change. Something's about to take place. And the Bible says that she had borne unto him children and Chzo and Hazel and Pilash and Jila and Beth. And Beth begot Rebecca. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; He's not even sent Elizer yet. &gt;&gt; He's not even commissioned Elizer yet. But I want to tell you before the servant ever went to get her. &gt;&gt; Before he ever went to get her, before he was ever commissioned by the father, Rebecca's name is already recorded. &gt;&gt; Her name is already recorded. And Abraham knows that there's a woman out there by the name of Rebecca and she's blood to you, Abraham. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; And Beth begott Rebecca. &gt;&gt; So he's at the well of the seven seals, seven old folks. &gt;&gt; It's revealed to him. It's made known to him. He receives the word. &gt;&gt; He's got some other blood tin out there. Hallelujah. That his brother's wife has given birth to a daughter and her name is Rebecca. &gt;&gt; So he listen to this. After the resurrection, &gt;&gt; amen, something happens and he hears this name. Now you move from Genesis 22 and you come to Genesis 24 and the Bible said Abraham was old. Watch him coming to the end. He was old and well stricken in age. Abraham. Can I say it the way I see it? Here comes the ancient of days. He's old and wellstricken in age. And the Lord had blessed Abraham and all things. &gt;&gt; So, some years has went by, some days has went by, some ages &gt;&gt; has went by. &gt;&gt; And at the end of the ages, Abraham sends his servant Isaac, his servant Eleazar, to find a bride for Isaac. So all of this time, Isaac has been maturing. I said Isaac has been maturing, but let me tell you, not only has Isaac been maturing, but Rebecca's been maturing as well. So there had to be some time that would go by to be able to allow Isaac to come to the place where we had the ability to reproduce seed. And not only Isaac reproduce seed, but the bride that he's going to marry, he's not coming marrying two year olds or three year old. He wants a bride that is mature. And he wants to make shallelujah. He wants to make sure that the bride is mature. &gt;&gt; Oh, notice this. He said, "And I'll make thee swear by the Lord, &gt;&gt; the God of heaven, the God of the earth. Thou shalt not take a wife unto my son of the daughters of these &gt;&gt; Canaanites." &gt;&gt; Do you know the prophet said, "Under no circumstance should a believer ever marry an unbeliever. How many knows that's your that's the message of the hour? &gt;&gt; Like it or lump it, it's for all of us. &gt;&gt; And Abraham being the first one tells him, he said, "You swear to me. You swear to me by the God that has made this promise. Swear to me, you'll not take a daughter out of these Canaanites." &gt;&gt; He don't want a Canaanitish woman. &gt;&gt; Don't you take a daughter from that great Don't you take one of them. I want somebody who's blood. I want somebody that's not a Hivite or a Jebusite or Amorite. I want somebody that can believe the word in its entirety, &gt;&gt; but I want you to go into my country and to my kindred and take a wife under my son Isaac. &gt;&gt; So he sends him to his lineage. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; So their blood kin. Isaac can only marry somebody who's got the same blood on him. &gt;&gt; I said Isaac cannot marry somebody outside the blood. That's the reason the prophet said you make sure that boy's got the Holy Ghost and you make sure that girl has got the Holy Ghost because that is the blood speaking in their life. Make sure it's not a Canaanite out here. Oh, they may look better. They may they may dress different than the daughters of God do, but don't get your eyes on that. The prophet said that only lasts so long. But get your eyes on that character. Get your eyes on that person that wants to worship and stand for God and believe. [Applause] &gt;&gt; Go to my people. What I'm showing you is every bit of this you have to agree has been orchestrated by God. &gt;&gt; You think all this happened by chance? God did not leave this moment to chance. God did not leave this moment to some type of a circumstance that it might work out and it might not work out. I'm telling you, God is behind every part of this. And now Abraham is going to commission this servant Ezer to go find a bride that'll follow him fully. &gt;&gt; Remember Eleazar asked him, "Should I take Isaac with me?" And Abraham says, "No, don't take him. Don't take No, no, no. For he said, "The Lord a God of heaven, which took me from my father's house," watch the way he types this, "that took me from my father's house, from the land of my kindred, which spake unto me and that swear unto me." Watch this, "He spake unto me. The one that prophesied, the one that spoke the word, the one that told me I was going to have a son, the one that told me, Amen. The one who made the promise, he has spoken." Abraham is not dealing by hearsay. He has been spoken to by the spoken word from God. And he said, "Unto thy seed will I give this land." And listen to this. And he, the one that made the promise, the one that kept this promise, the one that brought Isaac from the dead, &gt;&gt; he said he shall send his angel &gt;&gt; before thee. He shall send his angel before thee, &gt;&gt; and thou shalt take a wife unto my son from then. &gt;&gt; You know what he's telling Elazer? You're not going by yourself. &gt;&gt; You are not going down there alone. &gt;&gt; I'm letting you know that there's an angel that's been making these promises. The one that's been keeping his word. The one that's been manifesting himself. He is going to go with you. Amen. You will not go alone. But let me say this. God will not allow one promise of his word to fall short. And the prophet of God said he would bankrupt heaven before he'd allow one word to fall. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Do you want to know why the ministry of Eleazar was supernatural? There was an angel with him. &gt;&gt; It'll be the ministry of the angel through a man. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; Amen. that when the serpent comes to Mesopotamia, Haram, &gt;&gt; he comes to this place and remember the prophet said it took him about a month to get there and he's got everything he needs to get a bride. &gt;&gt; He's got everything he needs. He's got 10 camels that belongs to the father. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. It would be these camels that would carry Rebecca back &gt;&gt; to Isaac. &gt;&gt; Now, he's got gifts. &gt;&gt; He's got gold. &gt;&gt; He's got silver. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; But remember, the gifts was only bait on the hook. &gt;&gt; Can you do anything for this? &gt;&gt; The gifts was only bait on the hook. &gt;&gt; The gifts was wonderful, but which one would you rather have? the gift or the giver. &gt;&gt; I'd rather have the giver than all the gifts you can stack into this room. I would rather have the giver than the gift of the ministry that I got in my heart. I would rather have the giver than anything that Pentecost, Luther, Wesley, any of the rest of the ages can produce. Give us the giver. Let me tell you why. Because the giver can change our body. A gift will never change our body. But if the giver ever gets on the inside, the giver can change our body. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; So he goes to Haran and he's got to get her attention to prove that he is who he says he is. Ain't that awesome? So when he comes to Haran, he feels dro &gt;&gt; out of all the places around Haran that he can go. He ends up at a whale. &gt;&gt; So here's the ministry of Elijah. &gt;&gt; Right? &gt;&gt; Here's the ministry of Eleazar and he ends up at a whale. &gt;&gt; Amen. So whenever he goes, he's going. There's going to be people of all kinds of backgrounds. There's going to be all kinds. The Bible said with the daughters when actually daughters of men would come to draw water from that well. There's going to be all kind of women that's going to come there. It's got all kinds of backgrounds. They're going to have all kinds of beliefs. &gt;&gt; Remember where he come that Haram is actually a place of idolatry. &gt;&gt; So there's going to be idol worshippers there. &gt;&gt; There's going to be man worshippers there. Wow, there's people around this message ain't got rid of that spirit. &gt;&gt; Come on. &gt;&gt; There's going to be all kinds of people that's going to be there. But I want to tell you, Eleazar is not going to this well just to find anybody. He's coming to find a specific person. He wants the one that God has ordained to be Isaac's bride. [Applause] I can imagine the responsibility, &gt;&gt; the responsibility that's put upon this man's shoulders to make sure that you get the right one. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Can you imagine the responsibility on this servant to make sure it's the one that God wants? &gt;&gt; So, you know what the servant does? What every other servant does? &gt;&gt; They put it in the hands of God. I need your leadership. And he said, "Let it be, let it come to pass, Lord, &gt;&gt; that the damel to whom I shall say, let down thy picture that I may drink." &gt;&gt; Now, let me just stop here. &gt;&gt; If you don't have a picture, &gt;&gt; you're not the right one. &gt;&gt; You've got to meet the criteria to be able to be the right bride. And if you don't have a receiver, &gt;&gt; if you don't have a container, &gt;&gt; you are not the bride. You've got to be able to have something to receive. And not just receive, you've got to have something to give. &gt;&gt; Everybody's talking about giving and getting and getting and get. What about giving? What about watering some candles? What about watering the message? What about watering the word? You got to have something to be able to give. Brother, point the antenna closer here. I'm losing signal. Amen. We'll get it in a minute. Hang on. &gt;&gt; So, if you don't have a picture, then you know for sure you ain't the right one. But not only do you got to have a picture, but he says, "Let the woman that I say I want to drink." &gt;&gt; And in return, she's got to have a voice. She's got to say the right words. &gt;&gt; Come on. &gt;&gt; She's got to say the right words. &gt;&gt; And she will say, "Drink." So the message, &gt;&gt; the messenger Eleer has got to do his part. &gt;&gt; But Rebecca, you got to do your part, too. &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; And not only is she going to give me a drink, &gt;&gt; and here's &gt;&gt; the real trial, but she must give thy camels drink also. &gt;&gt; I just got to I know small places are pregnant, but she will give thy camels also. &gt;&gt; Think about that. She She's He's literally telling God, "These camels, they may belong to Abraham, but that ain't where they come from." &gt;&gt; Because every good gift, &gt;&gt; everything that Abraham owned, &gt;&gt; everything that Eleazar had, it came from Almighty God. &gt;&gt; That thy camels will say, and give thy drink to thy camels drink also. Let the same be she that thou hast appointed &gt;&gt; for thy servant Isaac. You're talking about believing in predestination. &gt;&gt; You're talking about believing in divine ordination that God can work things out. His This man believes in election. &gt;&gt; He knew what God said concerning the sea line. He knew what God said concerning the promise. &gt;&gt; He knew that Abraham's seed was going to be multiplied. And you can't multiply the seed unless you got a bride. &gt;&gt; So he prays this. And when he praised this at this well, before brother Ram ever even got done, there was already some bride coming out. &gt;&gt; Before he ever even got done, the Bible said it came to pass before he had done speaking &gt;&gt; that Rebecca come out. &gt;&gt; Watch the Bible. who was born to Bethl, son of Mila, the wife of Nahor, Abraham's brother, her picture with her picture on her shoulder. &gt;&gt; She's the right lineage. &gt;&gt; She's the right seed line. &gt;&gt; She's got a picture. &gt;&gt; Amen. Remember, this is the one in Genesis 22 at the bare seat of the well of the sevenfold. This is the very woman that was told to Abraham before he ever commissioned Eleazar. This is the one that's already been written about. &gt;&gt; But now she has to prove his word. &gt;&gt; She's got to vindicate Eloer's words to prove that she's the right one. &gt;&gt; So she's got the picture that carried the water. And whenever she went down to the well, oh my. And she gets this water. Here comes Elijah said, "I need a drink." Now, she's got to say the right words. She's got to speak the right words. She must respond correctly to the word. &gt;&gt; Anybody hear me? She must prophesy again. &gt;&gt; You surely believe &gt;&gt; there's something supernatural going on. &gt;&gt; There was something supernatural going on. &gt;&gt; Let me tell you why. Because before Eleazar ever even got there, the angel of the Lord &gt;&gt; had already arrived. &gt;&gt; He had already arrived on the scene. And whether she knew it or not, or Eleazar knew it or not, that angel was already at work. He was already moving. He was already wooing. He was already pulling up on that heart. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Don't you see why you come to this thing before you ever come to church? Before you ever made a decision, you didn't come to God because you wanted to. God was pulling on your heart and wooing upon your heart to bring you back to the promise, back to the word. Why? You're the seed of Abraham. &gt;&gt; I love the way the prophet says this. I believe the angel of the Lord had beat Eleazar there about half an hour. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. That tells me God travels faster than camels. &gt;&gt; I say God travels faster than thoughts. &gt;&gt; He had already be lesser there by a half an hour. For the Bible said he will send his angels before you to make the way clear. &gt;&gt; How many was at that well? How many women was at that well? And God, the angel come through there going, "You need to go home. You need to go ahead and go home. You need to get on out of here. It's time for you to go home. you've had all the water you need. You can get that water tomorrow. Can you imagine the procrastinator that was down there had procrastinated a week about getting to that well and she finally had made it down there, but something talked on the inside and said, "Go ahead and procrastinate a little bit more. I need you to get out of the way." And here comes Rebecca walking right after her to the well. &gt;&gt; God knows how to clear obstacles. Whatever is in your way from getting to the well tonight, God knows how to clear them obstacle. Don't worry about what your friends is going to say. Don't worry about your mama, what she's going to say or your daddy. God knows how to clear the obstacles to get you to the well. [Applause] [Music] [Applause] &gt;&gt; And there's Rebecca. She's in the house &gt;&gt; and Something moves over her. &gt;&gt; No, no, let me say it better than that. Someone &gt;&gt; someone moves over her. &gt;&gt; It says, "You need to go to that well." &gt;&gt; Am I thirsty? &gt;&gt; You need to go to that well. &gt;&gt; But I usually wait a little while before I go. No, you need to go to that well. &gt;&gt; You got to go to that well. &gt;&gt; And the more The more he spoke his word over her, &gt;&gt; it starts influencing her body. &gt;&gt; Anybody hear me? &gt;&gt; The more you hear this word, the more you hear this angel, the more the influence of that word will have over your life. Amen. The more you set under the preaching of the word, the more the influence, hallelujah, of the gospel that'll come to you. Why? Your influence from the mighty angels. The angel come and said, it was the angel of the Lord that come and spoke to Rebecca's heart and said, "Go get that water. &gt;&gt; Go get that water." &gt;&gt; And Rebecca arose. They may have been some that was sleeping &gt;&gt; under a layout of searing see a spirit. &gt;&gt; But something awoke her and said, "Go get that water." &gt;&gt; And said, "Rebecca, come to the well &gt;&gt; at the evening time. This ain't by chance. &gt;&gt; This ain't just Listen, friends. This is not by coincidence. &gt;&gt; Rebecca didn't just happen to be there. No more than Ezer just happened to be there. &gt;&gt; Something was working. The prayer of Eleazar before he ever prayed it. &gt;&gt; You hearing me? &gt;&gt; Before you was ever even born. She can't explain it. &gt;&gt; I'm telling you, there's things she cannot explain. &gt;&gt; I don't need it all explained, but I do need it revealed. &gt;&gt; You may not be able to explain things either. You may not be able to take your Bible here and here and here and here. You're not even called to do that. You can say, "I can tell you what I can. I may not be able to explain here and here and here and here." But let me tell you what I do. I believe it here. I believe it here. I believe it here. I believe it here because I got it in here. Amen. Hallelujah. I got it in here as a reason why I believe it. I may not be able to explain it, but I do believe it. [Applause] &gt;&gt; Let me ask you tonight, what brought you to this? Well, &gt;&gt; what brought you to this truth? What brought you to this message? Well, Brother David, my mom and my dad. Yeah. Then why are you still here? &gt;&gt; Some of them quit years ago. Some are just church sinners. Well, why are you still here? I'll tell you why. Because the angel of the Lord has been pulling upon your heart, pulling upon your mind, pulling upon your spirit, drawing you to the well. [Applause] &gt;&gt; And not only did you get here, you're staying here. &gt;&gt; I want to tell you, I'm glad that I got something. I might be up and down and up and down and up and down, but let me tell you what I'm not. I'm not in and out and in and out and in and out. I may be up and down, but I ain't in and out. Once I got in, he wouldn't let me out. &gt;&gt; Supernaturally, &gt;&gt; the angel of the Lord got a hold of you. Abraham said, "I wonder why." He says, "Have you ever wondered why that Rebecca came before any of the other girls?" Here's the reason. Because Eleazar had to find Rebecca &gt;&gt; in the evening time. &gt;&gt; The The sign was performed &gt;&gt; in the evening time. &gt;&gt; And that's the time that we're living in. &gt;&gt; And he says, "I trust you get this." &gt;&gt; And I'm going to tell you, I trust you get this. &gt;&gt; This is the evening time. So if it's the evening time &gt;&gt; and we got the well &gt;&gt; and we got the well, &gt;&gt; we got the message, &gt;&gt; we got truth. &gt;&gt; He said there was an evening time Rebecca came out led by the spirit. Do you believe that? How otherwise could she have come? &gt;&gt; There might have been a many before her. church to church, brother. &gt;&gt; But she was led &gt;&gt; by the spirit &gt;&gt; and leading. &gt;&gt; In other words, she was elected out of all the rest of the church's women. &gt;&gt; She was elected to come to this certain well. &gt;&gt; There may have been a lot of wells around Haram, but I want to tell you this is a predestinated spot &gt;&gt; because this is a meeting place. &gt;&gt; You hear what I'm saying? You're not here in this place by chance. You're not out here on this gravel road by chance. God's got a meeting place. And God puts whales wherever he wants them at. And when you come to the whale, just expect to hear truth. &gt;&gt; He said, "Did you know that Rebecca Na was blood relation?" The bride of Jesus Christ is blood relation to him. She's a bloodbought bride. &gt;&gt; No wonder she was led by the spirit. There was a connection. was over at Morgan's farm the other day. He said, "You see that wire right there? That'll bite you." Do you know why? It's hooked up to electric. &gt;&gt; And if you get grounded real good, you're going to connect. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; And then you're going to holler. &gt;&gt; Well, that's okay. That's what happened to me when I went to the altar. That's what happened when God got a hold of me. It to like 220 or even greater they got a hold of and we sweat and we cry and we ball and we snot. That's okay. That's the way every birth is. The prophet of God says every birth is a mess. &gt;&gt; I don't believe in no dried confession. &gt;&gt; I'm telling you, I don't believe in a dried confession. I don't care what you say. &gt;&gt; You mean to tell me you're sorry for your sins and it don't bring a tear out of your eyes? I believe in a blood religion that'll make you weep your way to Calvary until God squeezes your heart that the juice runs out of your eyes. [Applause] &gt;&gt; People around this message don't want that because they're compromisers. &gt;&gt; Because they ain't preaching a born again experience. They ain't preaching a new birth. &gt;&gt; I still believe in preaching against women cutting their hair. I preach against women wearing pants &gt;&gt; because it's against the word of God. &gt;&gt; We preach against women wearing makeup because it's against the word of God. That's an Elijah's message. [Applause] &gt;&gt; The prophet said if we don't preach it, you leave the door open, the goats will get in. &gt;&gt; I don't care what your last name is. &gt;&gt; I don't care what your family is. We've been called to a message of Ezer. It's time for you and I to actually do what the word says we can do. [Applause] &gt;&gt; He said there was a connection coming together. &gt;&gt; Listen to this. &gt;&gt; There was a union, &gt;&gt; an invisible &gt;&gt; union &gt;&gt; that was coming together. Come on. &gt;&gt; So before there was ever a physical manifestation &gt;&gt; of bride and groom, there was already an invisible union that was going on by the word. &gt;&gt; That's what happened the night you give your heart to God. &gt;&gt; That night that you went to the altar and surrendered yourself to God, God heard you. &gt;&gt; I said God heard you. &gt;&gt; Amen. God did his part. Then you did your part. You come and responded to the well. Brother said, "Why did Rebecca make that sudden move? Why did she go to the waters of life so quickly? Why could the angel speak to her?" &gt;&gt; Because she was blood relation to Isaac. &gt;&gt; And that's who the angel can speak to tonight. &gt;&gt; Those who are of a blood relation. &gt;&gt; She made her decisions quick. &gt;&gt; She didn't need six months to pray about this. She didn't need well let me sleep on it a couple nights. She didn't need to sleep on it a couple nights. &gt;&gt; She made her decision. Watch her real quick then. And then stops. He says, "Watch them in the meetings. Watch how quickly if they are are ordained to eternal life, they'll know it. &gt;&gt; They will know it &gt;&gt; because there's something in the message that stirs them. Hallelujah. There's something in the message that stirs them. That's what stirred Rebecca. The message stirred her and the angel was leading her. &gt;&gt; The angel that went before Eleazar had already be to stir that heart up. &gt;&gt; And this cake God was doing some baking. And whenever he got it just right, here comes her. Remember said the angel of the Lord was leading her. She got stirred. &gt;&gt; Did the Bible say she ran? Did the Bible say she hastened? &gt;&gt; This is where he got it at. Why? The message she come in contact with it. &gt;&gt; Then she was stirred. And immediately when she watered the camel, the gift went on her immediately. I'm going to tell you what we need sometimes. &gt;&gt; Listen friends, we need to be stirred more right now &gt;&gt; than what we ever have been. &gt;&gt; As a matter of fact, we got families that needs to be stirred. &gt;&gt; We got daddies that needs to be stirred. It's time for the church to wake up and get stirred up a little bit. We want a church that is stirred up. We want a preacher that is stirred up. Listen, friends, what good does it do for the pastor to be stirred and nobody else is stirred? It ain't pastor religion. This is a body move. I said this is a body move. I say tonight, God stirs from the front to the back. Whether you're sick, 16, 60, or 160, let the word of God come your way. Let it stir you out tonight. &gt;&gt; I say, keep on stirring, Lord. &gt;&gt; You're just about to get a cake right here, Lord. So when Ellie user asks for that drink, she's already start &gt;&gt; so she can respond quickly. &gt;&gt; Everything from this point on. When Ellie Ezer says, "Give me a drink." Whatever she says will determine everything after this. &gt;&gt; If she walks away, it's over. &gt;&gt; If she stays quiet, it's over. She must speak &gt;&gt; and she must say the right words. &gt;&gt; She says, "I'll give you a drink." &gt;&gt; And the next part that Eleazar prayed said, &gt;&gt; "Let her walk these candles." &gt;&gt; Maybe she'd seen a many men with all kinds of camels, &gt;&gt; but this day is different. &gt;&gt; And when she had done giving him drink, she said, "Hallelujah. I will draw water. Can you Imagine Ellie Eer said, "You talking about deja vu hoohoo?" &gt;&gt; She says, "Exactly. I will draw water for thy camels." &gt;&gt; Ain't that powerful? He says, "They're your camels." And she says, "Thy camels." &gt;&gt; Whose camels are they? &gt;&gt; She said, "I will draw water for thy camels until they have done drinking." &gt;&gt; They said that a thirsty camel can drink 30 gallons of water. Now, I don't know how big that picture was, but let's just guesstimate. All right. So, if there's 10 of them and they can drink 30. Think about this. And she's got a five gallallon pitcher. For some of us, we got a little bit bigger ones than that. Some of us got symbol size. I got all I want in 10 minutes, brother. I'm ready to go home. Praise God. I got all I need. I got all I need in the opening prayer. Some people say I'm coming to bring my cup. &gt;&gt; Here's my cup, Lord. I lift it up, Lord. &gt;&gt; I want to get as much as I can get. &gt;&gt; I said, I want to receive as much as I can get. I want to pull every ounce of strength that the man of God has. As a matter of fact, I want to pull him so hard I pull him out of his notes, out of his thoughts, out of his mind, pull it right out of his sermon and pull him right up into another dimension. I want to make him do my part and pull from the word of God. &gt;&gt; Don't you think about it? Five gallons, it would take 60 trips. &gt;&gt; 60 trips on five gallons. 300 gallons. God, I'm tired just thinking about it. And wells wouldn't, you know, as we have today, pull up on the road. They actually had stairways. So, she would have to go down. No, no, no. That's too good to miss. She couldn't stay up here all pies. She had to get low and she had to get down and get some of that water and go back up. Brother, can you imagine? Trip after trip. Three more trips, I'm going to have that one done. Four more trips, I'm gonna have that one. 10 more trips, I'm gonna have that. I don't know how many trips I got to make here to this well. If it's another 10 or another 20 or 100, I'm going to keep making my trip right down to this well. And I'm going to come right down if I got to go to the altar. I'm coming to get my picture and to fill it up to water the camel. This is a woman of character. She's not going to quit. She's not going to give up. She's not gonna stop. &gt;&gt; The Bible says she hastened. &gt;&gt; She hastened. &gt;&gt; In a picture in the tran again. &gt;&gt; Now I know like I said sometimes small places you just back. She emptied her pitcher into the trough &gt;&gt; which so happened to be the same water that Eleazar was drinking. &gt;&gt; So Eleazar and the camels was drinking the same water. &gt;&gt; Brother, don't talk about a messenger that just preached the message. He drunk the message. He believed the message. He didn't just want the messenger to give it. He believed what he was preaching. [Applause] First time I ever seen that, by the way. &gt;&gt; And then she hastened into the picture of the trough. Ran again. &gt;&gt; If I could just retitle the sermon today. Just run again. &gt;&gt; We're losing our runners. We got to keep running and keep running. Don't give up when you get tired. Don't give up when you make mistakes. Don't give up when you fall short. get back up and keep on running [Applause] until she drew water for all the camels. How in the world are you ever going to get to Isaac if you ain't watering this message? &gt;&gt; Watering is part of our lives. &gt;&gt; The waterway. Yes sir. &gt;&gt; Is the light today. &gt;&gt; I'm not talking about a sprinkling. &gt;&gt; I'm talking about a full immersion. &gt;&gt; It shall be light in the evening time. &gt;&gt; The path to glory you shall surely find. The waterway is the light today buried in the precious name of Jesus. &gt;&gt; Young and old repent of all your sins. The Holy Ghost will surely enter in. &gt;&gt; The evening light has come. It is a fact that God and Christ are &gt;&gt; Can you imagine that last I'm done. &gt;&gt; Can you imagine that last bucket of water? &gt;&gt; Sweating worse than I am right now. &gt;&gt; Just one more trip down there, &gt;&gt; Lord. One more trip. Give me strength for one more trip. &gt;&gt; And finally, you get down and maybe 300 gallons. You're going to have to reach way So you reach as far as you can &gt;&gt; and you fill the tub. &gt;&gt; I got something. &gt;&gt; I got something. &gt;&gt; What are you going to do with that bucket of water, Rebecca? I got one candle left. &gt;&gt; Listen to me. &gt;&gt; We've been in this thing for years. &gt;&gt; Some of us has been in it, brother. We've been in this thing for years. We've heard thousands on top of thousands of sermons. But listen, one day &gt;&gt; will be your last trip. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; One day I'll preach my last sermon, brother. We'll preach our last sermons. That'll be it. Your last trip to the well. &gt;&gt; That's the reason when I preach, I don't care if it's 66,600 or six. I preach as hard as I can preach. &gt;&gt; Because if that's my last trip to that well, I want to make sure I give him everything that I got. She gives that last one into the trough and that's it. And Ezer took the gifts. The moment she got done watering, she received the gifts from Eleaser. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Amen. What happens after you get done? You receive the Holy Ghost. Every one of you in the name of Jesus Christ from and you shall receive the gift of the Holy Ghost. Can you imagine? She's got bracelets, gold, silver, earrings, all these things. She's wearing them. &gt;&gt; She came there with nothing. &gt;&gt; We came to this thing with nothing. &gt;&gt; We couldn't help ourselves. We had addictions we couldn't get out of. We had family problems. We made a mess out of our life. We couldn't help ourselves. Well, that last time watering, &gt;&gt; he throws something on your hand, &gt;&gt; throws something on your finger, &gt;&gt; throws something around your neck, &gt;&gt; and then he asks the question, &gt;&gt; whose daughter? &gt;&gt; Can I ask you tonight? &gt;&gt; Whose daughter art thou? Tell me, I pray thee. He's asking her, where did you come from? &gt;&gt; What is your lineage? &gt;&gt; What is your bloodline? &gt;&gt; I know strange, but look at the way she answers. &gt;&gt; He said, "What is thy name?" He asks her, "What's your name? Whose daughter are you?" She could have just said, "Well, I'm just Rebecca." But she doesn't just say, "Rebecca, &gt;&gt; but she says, I'm the daughter of Bethu." &gt;&gt; The son of Mila, which she bare unto Nahor, which is Abraham's brother. Whenever the devil goes to circling around your life, &gt;&gt; he's not trying to ask you what your natural name is, &gt;&gt; but go ahead and give him your spiritual pedigree. &gt;&gt; Let him know I'm bloodbought. I'm water baptized. I got the Holy Ghost from the top of my head to the bottom of my feet. I've been saved by the blood of Jesus. I've been born again. He took my sins. He took my iniquity. He washed them in his blood. That's who I am tonight. If anybody ask you who I am, tell them I am. &gt;&gt; She tells him exactly what was told to father before Eleazer ever left. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Think about it. &gt;&gt; She tells him exactly what he needs to hear. Fast forward. It drives my family crazy. I listen to things and fast forward. I preach fast, talk fast, listen fast. We listen to the the broadcast of the news coming down the road. Oh, Lord mercy, it's going to rain. So, let's just listen and fast forward. She leaves and goes to her house. She went there with nothing on her wrist, nothing on her ears, no faith by hearing, nothing on her hands. But when she comes back, &gt;&gt; it's hard not to feel good about what God gives you. &gt;&gt; Kind of like that preacher one time, you don't think I'm blessed, look at my blessings. &gt;&gt; Can you imagine when she comes walking into the house, she's got this jewelry draped all over her. &gt;&gt; I can imagine come up and said, "Where did you get all that. &gt;&gt; Come see a man. &gt;&gt; I mean, come see a man. &gt;&gt; She come wearing the blessings of Abraham. &gt;&gt; Come on, somebody. &gt;&gt; The Bible said when she got done watering, the damel ran and told the mother's house the things that had happened unto hers. And let me just say this, she wasn't just telling them that she received something. She had an evidence. &gt;&gt; She had an evidence that what she heard is right. What she's hearing is real. What she believed is the truth. She's wearing her evidence. Brother and sister, don't you realize you are adorned with the word of God for this hour? And you are wearing your blessings around. You've been dressed by the word of this hour. Faith has come by hearing of the word of God. You've been adorned by the word. Laban comes out there. Everybody knows who Laban is. Ask Jacob. He'll tell you. She said, "What did you do to get all that? You'll never believe it. What did you do to turn that?" I didn't really do much myself. I gave him a drink, watered a few camels. I got I mean, I'm trying to Oh, look at my drip, honey. I'm dripping tonight. I got bling on top of bling and bling inside of bling. Come see a man that told me. And Laban says, "I'll find out if this is real." &gt;&gt; Laban leaves the house and goes down to the well. &gt;&gt; And the Bible says, &gt;&gt; "Let me quit. There stood the man." &gt;&gt; And the Bible interjects this. There stood the man &gt;&gt; by the candles. something about these camels. &gt;&gt; Now, he couldn't give everything to her at the well &gt;&gt; because that was a public display. &gt;&gt; But once he goes into her house, &gt;&gt; I'm not talking about first pool. I'm not talking about second pull. But when the third pull, remember in the secret place, &gt;&gt; it will not be a public show. Once he goes into the house, he begins to adorn her and give her everything that he has &gt;&gt; and the servant brought forth jewels of silver, jewels of gold and raignment and gave them to Rebecca unmarited favor. &gt;&gt; And then he asks her that question. &gt;&gt; He said, I will inquire and ask the damsel from her own mouth. I want her to say it. &gt;&gt; That means she cannot remain silent. She has got to answer at the right time of the right day. And he said unto her, "Will you go with me?" And her answer is, "I will go." But Rebecca, you've never seen him. Oh, I've seen him. &gt;&gt; I'm telling you, there's something in here I cannot fully explain. &gt;&gt; But I think this is what I'm called to do. I mean, it's hard for me to explain it to Laban and and mother and father. It's it's it's hard to explain to sister, but all I know is something's happened to you &gt;&gt; and I'm willing to go. &gt;&gt; And the Bible said Rebecca rose her and her damsels and they rode up on the camels &gt;&gt; and followed the man. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Don't be ashamed to follow men. Everybody's followed men. &gt;&gt; Just make sure you're following the right man. She followed the man and the servant took Rebecca and went his way. Oh, hallelujah. And Isaac, listen to this. Watch the other side. Now, let me close. Watch Isaac. And Isaac came from the way of the well of Lahore. For he had dwelt in the south country. But he comes to the well. Look where this meeting is going to be at. He's going to meet Rebecca at another well. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; And this well is called the well of the living one. seeing me. So, she's going to the living well, and that's where the meeting in the air is going to be at. Isaac is going to see her at the well of the one who is seeing me. &gt;&gt; So, she's going to an inexhaustible well, a fountain of attributes, and she's going to meet him. Listen friends, our Lord will not meet us upon this earth, but God has a meeting place already prepared. And the Bible said, "And Isaac went out to meditate in the field at the evening tide. And he lifted up his eyes, and he saw the camels were coming." You think you've been anticipating? What about Isaac? Can you imagine what at one time was just thought in memory and mind, but now it's year after year it's had to manifest this and then he had to do this and then they backslide. He had to pick them up. They backslide. And God's done this for 6,000 years. But now it's time to meet her. The anticipation in his heart. Can you imagine? Can you imagine natural Isaac his blood pressure going up thinking the camels are coming and I'll say this Isaac recognizes daddy's camels and whenever they got close Rebecca says what man is this that walketh in the field to meet us I bet they'd seen a many men along that road but this one looks different and the servant has said it is my master. Therefore, she took a veil and covered herself. So, the meeting in the air, there's going to be a change of veils. &gt;&gt; There's going to be a change of veils. And the Bible says, "And Rebecca lifted up her eyes." Isn't that something? Rebecca lifted up her eyes and Paul said, "You'll be changed in a moment, in a twinkling of a And when she lifted up her eyes, she saw Isaac. And the way the program explains this is as she's coming that Eleazar didn't even have time to stop the camels, but the Bible said she lighted off the camel. She jumped. She didn't even wait to be lowered down as a as a real lady would. &gt;&gt; The anticipation was so great, &gt;&gt; she didn't want to wait another second. You know how impatient you be? I'm ready to go. And the honey sitting in the car and you're sitting there going, "All right, baby. Let's go. Let's go. Let's go. Let's go. Let's go." Can you imagine? She doesn't even wait for the car to get stopped. Slings the door open. She jumped off the camel. And said she met him in the middle of the field. And he said, "That's where the bride's going to meet him at, in the middle of the air." Isaac had left the field, had left his tent, was meditating in the field that afternoon. He saw Rebecca coming She never saw him before. She never saw him. But it was love at first sight. She fell in love with him and he with her. And she was even veiled. But he fell in love with her. And when she seen him, her heart was so full of joy. She didn't know who she was going to marry, but by faith she believed. And Bar said, "When Jesus leaves the kingdom, we'll meet the king in glory. will meet even the air between the heavens and the earth where it's been expanded to be able to redeem us. And he'll meet Rebecca, listen, between his home and hers. &gt;&gt; Praise be to God. I want to go, don't you? Listen, friends, I don't know how you feel. Whatever I got to do to make it, &gt;&gt; I've got to make this. &gt;&gt; I don't care what I got. I don't want to miss this. Whatever you got to do, whatever you got to sacrifice in life, what does it matter for that one meeting? The prophet tells us the very camels that Rebecca watered was the very word that took her to meet her bridegroom, Isaac. I say tonight, don't you quit watering. Don't give up. I don't matter how many battles you went through, trials in your life, and it may look like it's totally impossible. I'm telling you, there's coming a meeting. The anticipation is so great. We've heard about him, preached about him, talked about him, fellowshipped about him. We've been in services like last night when the presence of God comes down so strong and your heart melts in his presence. What's it going to be where it won't be temporary well visits? &gt;&gt; But whenever you move into his presence, when I get done preaching in just in a few minutes, I'll go to the back room. I'll leave the anointing that is up on me. It'll just start leaving me and start drifting away. What's it going to be when it never leaves you again? &gt;&gt; The excitement that you feel them, some people don't even understand, brother, why in the world do you preach so hard? You're bold as a line. Why are you bold as a line? He's the lion of the tribe of Judah. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And you can't help it. You don't want nobody to miss it. You don't want from the smallest to the greatest. Let nobody miss it. I've got to make it more than anything else. Oh, let's just bow our heads today. Oh my. Maybe you're in your this place. Maybe maybe you're having trouble watering the camels. What should you do? Maybe something in the word tonight has moved your heart. Young man, young lady, maybe you not been where you need to be. I want to tell you tonight, just take another trip down to the well. Fill up your picture tonight. Don't leave here empty. Why would you leave here empty? Leave here as full as you can leave. When these meetings are over, whenever you get done, say, "Lord, I'm going to leave here with everything I can take. I'm taking every ounce of this water, and I don't want to spill a drop of it." Maybe you've been battling, struggling in life. I want to tell you, there's help for you tonight. I believe that almighty God, he will answer your prayer that you've been praying about. The things that you've been mentioning before him, God can answer that prayer. Young lady, you needing a husband, young man, you need a wife. I believe that God can answer that prayer tonight. You got a sickness in your body. I believe that God can answer that for you. Remember who we serve. Remember how powerful he is. The Bible says you have not because you ask not.

How many's been touched by the Lord tonight? Amen. What a powerful, powerful message. &gt;&gt; Amen. You got to talk about that angel &gt;&gt; before Rebecca ever came to the well. There was an angel that was preparing everything just to lead her down to the well. Man, isn't that powerful? Here she took off towards the well. You can just hear that angel calling out, "Don't forget the picture. She's got a she's got something to do down there at the well." And he equipped her with what she had need of. And we we come to this to worship and to entertain him. Amen. To pour our praise out before God. And the very thing that we're entertaining is the very carry us out of this world. &gt;&gt; Amen. So whatever you're doing, it's not in vain. There wasn't one ounce of water that she carried that was in vain. Every ounce of it had a purpose. It would carry her home. &gt;&gt; So friends, let me tell you, whenever the bucket gets heavy, just keep drawing. What a powerful message. How many enjoyed that message tonight? I tell you one of these days and it might be tomorrow. &gt;&gt; I just happen to still believe that &gt;&gt; we may not and just wake up in the morning look down and you don't look like your hands start look a little different. Your feet look a little different. Brother Dave, you're going to look a lot different. A lot of things are changing. We're going to be called out of this old body, this old robe of flesh and given a new body. You say, "How do you know that?" Well, let me tell you, the same God that created this one certainly is still a creator. &gt;&gt; I can tell you what a prophet said. He said he's over there right now building a city for you. Said he's building right now. And how is he building it? He said it's to her liking. &gt;&gt; Just to her liking. So you'll be satisfied with it. What God is creating for you, you'll be satisfied with it. When you walk out of these doors tonight, you look up at the stars of of the heaven and the moon that's in the sky. When you wake up in the morning, look at the sun that God created. And to think that a God can create that. He made that. &gt;&gt; And that same God is making a new heaven and a new earth. &gt;&gt; Amen. A new city that'll come down upon this earth that we'll we're going to live there one day. It ain't a fairy tale. It's a reality. That same God. Amen. Do you believe that tonight? &gt;&gt; Amen. We just say certainly been a blessing. How many's been blessed by the meetings? &gt;&gt; Amen. We just trust that it's been a blessing to you. It's furthered your walk with God. It strengthened your resolve to to serve God and to believe this message. I I believe every one of these men of God were sent here to deliver the message that they have delivered thus far. Amen. We're looking forward to end the morning. Brother Andrew is going to close our our meeting in the morning at 11 o'clock. And uh I know that God certainly has some great things in store. You know, if a prophet said that end time evangelism was was the shaping of the stones, that that's quite a shaper right there. And when you're talking about an evangelist, they can do some shaping. And a lot of these young people that are here and many of us that are here and he's had a a big impact uh on our life and and many of you gave your heart to the Lord through his ministry. And so, we just look for God to use him in a mighty way tomorrow. And and uh you know, it's it's He started the meeting. It's just fitting that he end it and and God to use him and and we we appreciate God using every one of these great men of God. And each one a different gift. Isn't it wonderful? I love hearing preachers. I I sit there all night and listen to different ministers and how they approach the the word differently and how they read things differently. They see it differently. That's all different gifts. And it's just I just love hearing good solid gospel preaching. And I I appreciate Brother David for that. and he's he's always been a blessing to me. Always everything every time I've ever heard him preach, it's something that you remember forever. And you know, I I certainly pray that the Lord would strengthen him. I know he's got to go back home and he would strengthen them on their journey and be able to go back to their home church and and we just want to pray for him tonight to draw strength. And I know the sisters have some food and things that's prepared next door. So, we're going to fellowship with everybody. Just want to tomorrow service at 11:00. A lot of folks have 10. So, it will be 11:00. That's our normal Sunday morning time. And and so we just look forward to God. How many's looking forward to the service? Amen. Amen. We just got a right to draw together as believers come together for a meeting and to fellowship around the word of God. And so we we certainly look forward to that. Let's just bow our heads together. And as you remember the upcoming service, remember brother David. Gracious heavenly father, Lord, we are so thankful for an opportunity, Lord, to come and hear the word that you've spoke to us tonight. Lord, how fitting that it is to hear the story of Rebecca. And Lord, knowing that that very call of God that came to our life, Lord, that you had already given us what we needed to respond to it. Lord, how many maybe would hear the same call, but they wouldn't have the same response. But I remember the teaching of of the prophet of God, how he would show us that our response is what identified who we were. And Lord, I just thank you, Lord, for that kind of response, Lord. And I thank you for the vindication of the identification of the bride of Jesus Christ, Lord. how much it means to us to know who we are and to be able to find our place in the scripture and have our identity. Lord, in a a time when the world is searching for that very thing and don't know who they are or where they're from and but God, you've given us a true identity. Lord, I pray, Lord, that that's been opened in the minds of the people, Lord, through this meeting. And Lord, I pray that they've been strengthened. Lord, I pray that you would help us as we go from this place. Lord, may we continue to grow draw strength from your word and God bring us back safely in the morning. Lord, we pray for the food, Lord, that is prepared next door that you would bless it. Lord, I pray for the time of fellowship. Lord, give each one strength now. We ask we go from this place, Lord, let us continue to feed upon thy word. We pray in Jesus Christ's name. Amen. Amen. God bless you as you go tonight. Well, I'm laying up my treasures in the home above. Trusting fully, trusting in the Savior's love. Doing what I can for the Holy D. I'm getting ready to leave this world. Well, I'm getting [Music] I'm getting ready for the gates of Pearl. Keeping my record right, watching both day and night. I'm getting ready to leave this world.

Well, I'm getting ready to leave this world. I'm getting ready for the gates of pearl. I'm keeping my record right, watching both day and night. I'm getting ready to leave this world to prepare a mansion. Jesus said, "I'll go." If it were not true, I would have told you so. Well, just a little while to linger here below. But I'm getting ready to leave this world. Well, I'm getting ready to leave this world of sorrow. I'm getting ready for the gates of hell. I'm keeping [Music] [Music]
