[49:13] amen amen we just want to invite you to
[49:15] the scripture and I know we've got a
[49:18] little bit of a late start but I'll be
[49:20] uh conscious of it we just want to read
[49:22] out of the book of Ephesians in the
[49:23] first chapter and we're going to read
[49:25] from the first verse and uh when you get
[49:28] there just say amen and we'll just uh
[49:32] been speaking on the bride's position
[49:34] and uh before the meetings and and uh
[49:36] this morning I want to take one more uh
[49:39] step in that direction on the bride's
[49:41] position now how many are familiar with
[49:43] that term the bride I know that that
[49:45] those that are a local assembly but
[49:47] maybe some visitors or uh that may be
[49:49] not familiar as much but that is the
[49:51] term that is used uh to describe the
[49:54] true church in the end times time it's
[49:56] those that as a body of Believers we
[49:58] collectively the Bride of Jesus Christ
[50:00] in other words it was the church that
[50:02] God has accepted and put his name on and
[50:04] and Christ came to be the head over the
[50:06] church and so uh we you find that all
[50:08] through the scripture and uh but uh as
[50:11] as individuals you're Sons and Daughters
[50:13] of God but as a body we're the bride of
[50:16] Christ and so we're the church that God
[50:18] chose and I'm I'm proud to be a part of
[50:19] that and there's many this Bride is a
[50:21] many membered bride all over the world
[50:23] and there's there's there's a there's a
[50:25] people that are gathering today that are
[50:27] a part of the Bride of Jesus Christ and
[50:28] I'm just proud to be numbered by as one
[50:31] of them amen so I want to read this out
[50:33] of Ephesians the first chapter the first
[50:34] verse Paul says I an apostle of Jesus
[50:37] Christ by the will of God to the Saints
[50:39] which are at Ephesus and to the faithful
[50:41] in Christ Jesus Grace be to you and
[50:44] peace from God our Father and from the
[50:46] Lord Jesus Christ blessed be the God and
[50:49] father of our Lord Jesus Christ who hath
[50:52] blessed us with all spiritual blessings
[50:55] in Heavenly places in Christ according
[50:58] as he hath chosen Us in him before the
[51:01] foundation of the world that we should
[51:03] be holy and Without Blame before him in
[51:06] love having predestinated us unto the
[51:09] adoption of children by Jesus Christ to
[51:11] himself according to the good pleasure
[51:14] of his will to the praise of the glory
[51:16] of his grace wherein he hath made us
[51:20] accepted in the Beloved and we'll just
[51:22] ask the Lord to add His blessings to the
[51:25] reading of the word this morning now I'm
[51:26] not going to hold you very long I know
[51:28] we're starting late so we'll just get in
[51:30] here and have church for a little bit
[51:31] and and uh we just want to allow the
[51:34] Lord to have the Liberty to to speak to
[51:36] us and bring us further along in our
[51:38] walk with God how many say Amen to that
[51:40] that's the desire of the Believers and I
[51:42] want to speak this morning as we're on
[51:44] this subject of the bride's position I
[51:46] want to use this as a subtitle the
[51:48] reality of God's blessing the reality of
[51:51] God's blessing last time whenever we
[51:52] spoke we had went into 2 Corinthians
[51:55] Ians in the 7th chapter and and Apostle
[51:58] Paul was speaking of he said as we have
[52:00] these promises remember we went through
[52:01] the promises of God how many was here
[52:02] for that and we went through the promise
[52:04] some I know there was more than that how
[52:06] many was here for that remember we went
[52:08] through the promises about three weeks
[52:09] ago on a Sunday morning and it was about
[52:11] the same time 11:30 11:45 and but we
[52:14] went through the promises of God that
[52:16] that that were given to the bride in the
[52:17] end time and then uh and then the last
[52:20] service that we spoke what Paul said
[52:21] having these promises he said let us
[52:23] cleanse ourselves and so we went in the
[52:25] message of of of of a perfect Holiness
[52:28] and in that message I ended it in the in
[52:30] recognizing your day in its message we
[52:32] actually ended it with this quote and uh
[52:35] uh and and in this message brother Bram
[52:36] was preaching recognizing your day uh
[52:39] showing where the bride is today or the
[52:41] position of the Bride spiritually
[52:42] speaking and showing where she is uh in
[52:46] in regards to the condition of the world
[52:48] and the age that we live in and and and
[52:50] and and the world has come to their
[52:52] place and the bride must come to her
[52:53] place and so uh we've seen this is how
[52:55] that things are happening around the
[52:56] world and I know there's many things
[52:58] that the world don't have an answer to
[53:00] but I thank God this morning that we
[53:01] don't just have to wonder what's going
[53:03] on and have to come to church scared and
[53:05] not know what tomorrow holds but we know
[53:08] we we may not know everything's going to
[53:09] happen tomorrow but we sure know who
[53:10] holds tomorrow and we know he's got it
[53:12] in control brother Mark and so we come
[53:14] uh today with confidence in the word of
[53:16] God knowing who we are and knowing where
[53:18] we are in the age that we live in and uh
[53:20] the things they don't have the answer to
[53:22] I believe that God has given us the
[53:23] answer uh in the end time and we see the
[53:26] world as it's getting into position you
[53:28] look at the chaos and the wars and the
[53:30] failures and all this crazy things
[53:32] that's going on in the world today and
[53:33] you see it's just the world that's
[53:35] getting in a position for the rapturing
[53:37] of the church but friends if the world
[53:39] is getting in position for the rapturing
[53:40] of the church well then the church has
[53:42] to get in position for the rapturing of
[53:43] the church and I thank God that there's
[53:45] a little bride somewhere that's getting
[53:47] in that same place she's not she's not
[53:49] wrapped up in the world and caught up in
[53:51] everything that's going on but she's
[53:52] caught up in the word of God preparing
[53:54] her heart for for the rapturing of the
[53:56] Bride of Jesus Christ and in this
[53:58] message we read this as as we were
[53:59] closing brother R says see it's what the
[54:01] world they can't accept what's being
[54:03] done now they're going out crying
[54:04] there's going to be a Breaking of the
[54:06] day there's a great thing that's going
[54:07] to happen pray pray pray we're not too
[54:09] late yet isn't that the way the world is
[54:11] it's just a constant chaos everybody get
[54:13] together and pray something's going to
[54:14] happen there's got to be a Great
[54:15] Awakening there's got to be a great move
[54:17] of God he said they're crying and
[54:18] believing there's going to be something
[54:20] they're good people he said but why are
[54:22] they doing it what what have they done
[54:23] is they've not recognized The Awakening
[54:26] of the Bride of Jesus Christ said see by
[54:28] being a Christian they feel the pull of
[54:30] the hour but they haven't recognized
[54:32] what's already been done and it's making
[54:34] them feel that way they know something
[54:36] is supposed to happen they know
[54:37] something is happening something is
[54:39] going on in this world but they're
[54:40] looking for it way off in the future but
[54:43] to come but they don't realize that it's
[54:44] already happened right by you my isn't
[54:47] that the way way it's always been
[54:48] whenever Jesus came to the Earth that's
[54:50] the same thing that happened in the old
[54:52] days they were waiting for the coming of
[54:53] a messiah they were waiting on a
[54:55] forerunner to come and and forerun the
[54:57] the first coming of Christ they believed
[54:59] that he would come but whenever they
[55:01] came they cut the head off the
[55:02] Forerunner and hung the Messiah on a
[55:04] cross said see why did they do it
[55:06] because they didn't recognize the day
[55:08] they were living in they they didn't
[55:09] recognize that this wasn't something for
[55:11] the future any longer but they were
[55:12] living in that age and I thank God that
[55:14] there's a people today that recognize
[55:16] that we're living in the age of the
[55:18] rapturing of the Bride of Jesus Christ
[55:20] it ain't just some story anymore it
[55:22] ain't just some Bible story or something
[55:24] that we're looking for in the the future
[55:25] but brother Mark we recognize it in the
[55:27] age that we're living in so see why did
[55:29] they not see it brother Joe because they
[55:31] were blind they were they were blinded
[55:32] and you said well what causes blindness
[55:34] what caused them to not be able to see
[55:36] the age that they were living in brother
[55:38] Bram said it was because it was
[55:40] prophesied that they would be blinded
[55:41] how many remember Isaiah in the sixth
[55:43] chapter he goes and and he begins to
[55:45] speak of the way it would be in the end
[55:46] time he said I will tell the people they
[55:48] would hear ye indeed but not understand
[55:50] and see but not perceive he said for the
[55:53] he said see their eyes would be shut L
[55:54] they they would see with their eyes
[55:55] their ears would be shut unless they
[55:57] would hear with their ears and be
[55:59] converted and understand with their
[56:00] heart so Isaiah makes this prophecy that
[56:02] this is the condition that people would
[56:04] be in in in in in in Matthew the 13th
[56:07] chapter when Jesus begins to preach in
[56:09] his Earthly Ministry he speaking in
[56:11] Parables remember every everything that
[56:13] he talked in front of the in front of
[56:15] the uh the the the public it was
[56:17] speaking in Parables and the disciples
[56:18] came to him and they said Lord why do
[56:20] you speak in Parables the people there
[56:22] why don't you just speak plainly and
[56:24] tell them where we are and who you are
[56:26] and why this is why why can't you just
[56:28] make it plain why why do you speak in
[56:29] Parables and Jesus answers this question
[56:31] in this way he says I speak to them in
[56:34] Parables because in seeing they see not
[56:36] in hearing they hear not neither do they
[56:38] understand he said for in them it is
[56:41] fulfilled the prophecy of Isaiah which
[56:43] saith by hearing you shall hear and you
[56:45] shall not understand seeing you shall
[56:46] see and shall not perceive for the
[56:48] people's heart is waxed gross their ears
[56:50] are dull of hearing and their eyes they
[56:52] have closed lest at any time they should
[56:54] should see with their eyes and hear with
[56:57] their ears and should understand with
[56:58] their heart and should be converted and
[57:00] I should heal them hear or heal them and
[57:02] so here you notice as G I'm just laying
[57:04] a foundation as as Jesus is speaking of
[57:06] this he shows that he speaks in Parables
[57:09] because there are those that were not
[57:10] meant to hear isn't it something that he
[57:12] would speak this way he spoke in a way
[57:14] that only the Believers would catch what
[57:16] he was saying he said it isn't meant for
[57:18] them to hear it it didn't meant for them
[57:20] to see it it was prophesied that they
[57:21] couldn't see it it was prophesied that
[57:23] their ears would be closed they wouldn't
[57:25] hear it in other words not everybody
[57:27] that heard Jesus preach believe what he
[57:28] said not everybody that went to the
[57:30] meetings they believed it when they left
[57:32] the meetings not everybody that went to
[57:34] The Sermon on the Mount came down from
[57:35] the sermon and was a disciple of Jesus
[57:37] Christ not everybody except when they
[57:39] saw the Miracles became a follower of
[57:41] him and friends it's the same thing it
[57:43] is today not everybody comes to church
[57:45] and leaves out the Bride of Jesus Christ
[57:47] not everybody comes to the house of God
[57:49] and leaves out worshiping God and being
[57:51] a Christian and cleaning up their life
[57:53] preach brother Matt I thank you I
[57:54] believe I might I I don't think
[57:56] everybody that comes and sits on a
[57:57] church pew can call themsel a Christian
[57:59] they may be a good church member but see
[58:01] that it takes something reality a people
[58:03] that has an ear to hear and an eye to
[58:05] see that's what makes them a real
[58:07] believer and a Christian and a real
[58:09] follower of Jesus Christ Proverbs the
[58:12] 20th chapter the Bible says the hearing
[58:15] ear and the Seeing Eye the Lord has made
[58:18] both of them so the ear that can hear
[58:21] the Lord made the eye that can see the
[58:23] Lord made many are looking to hear
[58:25] they're looking to see and here Jesus
[58:27] would tell us it wasn't for them to see
[58:29] it wasn't for them to hear it was God
[58:32] that had closed their eyes and they
[58:33] closed their ears to understanding
[58:35] friend don't you realize there's nothing
[58:37] that Jesus could have done that would
[58:38] have ever made them be a believer I know
[58:40] that's the way people think today well
[58:42] you know there's some that that are out
[58:44] there that don't that they aren't
[58:45] Believers and they they're not
[58:46] Christians and ma can you go brother
[58:48] Matt can you preach to him can you talk
[58:49] to this one just another time can you
[58:51] preach him another word can you say one
[58:53] more thing friends don't you realize
[58:54] there's people in this world today and I
[58:56] know it's hard to swallow but there's
[58:58] people in this world today it don't
[59:00] matter how much preaching they hear
[59:01] they'll never be a believer it don't
[59:03] matter how much Supernatural they see
[59:05] they'll never be a disciple of Jesus
[59:07] Christ it don't matter how many miracles
[59:09] it doesn't matter how much time that you
[59:10] would spend explaining it to them
[59:12] brother Mark they'll never accept it
[59:13] they'll never follow it they'll never be
[59:15] a Christian they'll never be a believer
[59:17] they'll never come and sit on a a church
[59:19] pew and worship God and back the word of
[59:21] God they'll never do it because it ain't
[59:23] in them to do it friends if I felt that
[59:25] way in any way I'd run to God I wouldn't
[59:27] walk to God I'd run to God if I felt
[59:30] like I hear preaching and it ain't doing
[59:31] nothing to me and I hear the word being
[59:33] spoke and something ain't changing on
[59:35] the inside of me I'd lay down everything
[59:37] I have and I'd run to almighty God God
[59:39] don't let me be one that would live in
[59:41] this age and have ears that can't hear
[59:44] and eyes that can't
[59:46] see but I thank God that wasn't the end
[59:48] of it see that wasn't the only class of
[59:50] people that was in the world here Jesus
[59:52] was answering this question brother
[59:53] Wesley and and as he answered it he said
[59:56] see they have eyes and ears but they
[59:57] can't see and hear but Jesus said but
[59:59] blessed are your
[1:00:01] ears for they hear and blessed are your
[1:00:05] eyes for they see by isn't it wonderful
[1:00:09] blessed are your ears for they hear and
[1:00:11] blessed are your eyes for they see
[1:00:14] blessed are you that you can receive a
[1:00:16] revelation of the word of God my is that
[1:00:19] a wonderful message blessed are you
[1:00:21] brother Bobby that that you're a
[1:00:22] Believer blessed are you that you can
[1:00:24] say Amen to the word of God blessed are
[1:00:26] you that there's something on the inside
[1:00:28] of you that when you hear the truth
[1:00:30] being spoken something Rises up and say
[1:00:32] Lord let me live that with all my heart
[1:00:34] blessed are you for you have ears to
[1:00:36] hear and eyes to see see these are those
[1:00:39] that were blessed of God I know many
[1:00:42] times we think about blessings and we we
[1:00:44] use a very carnal thinking to think
[1:00:46] about blessings and cursings see there
[1:00:49] but all through the scripture we'll find
[1:00:50] you'll find that there's this is the way
[1:00:52] we think as long as good things are
[1:00:53] happening to us we then I'm living under
[1:00:55] the blessing of God but then when bad
[1:00:57] things happen I must be living under a
[1:00:58] curse see there's a that's the problem
[1:01:01] with preaching that I know there there's
[1:01:03] many that has preached that something
[1:01:04] happens in your life well youve done
[1:01:05] something wrong and it's the curse of
[1:01:07] God on your life or or you know and but
[1:01:09] then whenever something happens to them
[1:01:10] they they don't want to remember that no
[1:01:11] more so see that's why you don't say
[1:01:13] that kind of stuff because it ain't got
[1:01:15] nothing to do with it well God's
[1:01:16] blessing me today and he's cursing me
[1:01:18] tomorrow and and all all these things
[1:01:20] that people say you see but the
[1:01:21] blessings of God and and there are
[1:01:23] blessings of God God does bless his
[1:01:25] children but the blessings of God are
[1:01:27] not the same as a person that is blessed
[1:01:29] of God there's a big difference in
[1:01:31] blessings and being blessed I've
[1:01:34] preached a series on that one time but
[1:01:36] see the blessings of God comes in many
[1:01:38] ways and it comes to many people think
[1:01:40] of just blessings any better just think
[1:01:42] of the blessings of God isn't it
[1:01:43] wonderful to think about I know we don't
[1:01:45] preach about it a lot because people
[1:01:47] they they they get all weird about you
[1:01:48] when you just talk you talking about God
[1:01:50] blessing people but but but God does
[1:01:52] bless his children Jesus said he made
[1:01:54] maketh his son to rise on the evil and
[1:01:56] on the good and he sendeth rain on the
[1:01:58] just and on the unjust see he gives and
[1:02:01] he takes you think about how how God is
[1:02:04] and see brother Bram says see sometimes
[1:02:06] we get to a place we think God blesses
[1:02:07] us he gave me a Cadillac he gave me a
[1:02:09] better job he gave me this he said
[1:02:11] there's no sign that he can't turn his
[1:02:12] Blessing from you God does bless you he
[1:02:15] said see when you get lifted up and you
[1:02:16] say well I once laid all night and I
[1:02:18] prayed and and I once I once went to
[1:02:20] church and I once served God and I once
[1:02:22] spent time and dedicated he said I once
[1:02:24] done I once done this and that but I
[1:02:26] don't do it anymore he said then you're
[1:02:27] on Dangerous Ground it don't matter how
[1:02:30] much God has blessed you brother Mar if
[1:02:31] you ever get to a place where I don't
[1:02:33] have to pray no more you're on Dangerous
[1:02:35] Ground well God's been blessing me and
[1:02:37] and and my he just poured His blessings
[1:02:38] out on me I don't have to do nothing no
[1:02:40] more you're on Dangerous Ground I don't
[1:02:42] have to get to church early and get
[1:02:43] ready and prepare for service you're on
[1:02:45] Dangerous Ground I don't I don't have to
[1:02:47] have a a prayer meeting anymore for my
[1:02:48] children God's going to take care of
[1:02:50] them cuz he said they belong to me
[1:02:51] you're on Dangerous Ground when you get
[1:02:53] to a place where you don't pray and you
[1:02:55] don't worship God and you can't do the
[1:02:57] things of God and you can't go to church
[1:02:58] and you can't and you can't you can't
[1:03:00] say Amen you can't lift your hand no
[1:03:02] more I don't have to do that no more
[1:03:03] because after all I'm blessed of God he
[1:03:06] said you're on Dangerous Ground that's
[1:03:08] the spirit of Le oosa brother Mark the
[1:03:10] Bible said they'd be rich and increased
[1:03:11] with goods and have need of nothing
[1:03:13] they're on Dangerous Ground they don't
[1:03:15] need nothing anymore we don't need God
[1:03:16] anymore after all God has given me many
[1:03:19] blessings they've heard so much of it
[1:03:22] they don't need it they've heard so much
[1:03:23] word preached we don't need any word
[1:03:25] preached anymore I've been to church my
[1:03:26] whole life I don't have to go anymore
[1:03:28] because I've heard all of it I need to
[1:03:29] hear I'll just go whenever my favorite
[1:03:31] people are there and then I'll come and
[1:03:32] hang out with everybody else you're on
[1:03:33] Dangerous
[1:03:35] Ground the word came this is what people
[1:03:38] think that God gives us Commandments and
[1:03:40] he gave us the Bible to rule over you
[1:03:42] it's the way to rule over you or God to
[1:03:44] hold you down or keep you in line but do
[1:03:45] you realize that God actually gave his
[1:03:48] word for for a a way to bless his
[1:03:51] children that's why he give his word
[1:03:53] that's why he give the Commandments have
[1:03:54] you ever thought of it that way that he
[1:03:56] gave it to bring a blessing to your life
[1:03:59] brother Mark this may be hard for y'all
[1:04:00] to to hear talking about the blessings
[1:04:02] might ought but a smile on every face
[1:04:05] this is what the Bible said blessed is
[1:04:06] the man that fearth the Lord that
[1:04:09] delighteth greatly in his Commandments
[1:04:11] he shall not be afraid of evil Tidings
[1:04:13] and his heart is fixed trusting in the
[1:04:16] Lord isn't it wonderful to trust God and
[1:04:19] and that he he would give us his word as
[1:04:21] a way to be able to to be able to
[1:04:23] Delight in the Commandments of God that
[1:04:24] he could bring blessings upon our life
[1:04:26] say see so if a heart is fixed on God
[1:04:28] God blesses that man it doesn't mean you
[1:04:30] don't go through trials God chases those
[1:04:32] he loves it don't mean you don't you
[1:04:33] don't go through things he molds us he
[1:04:35] shapes us he's always working on us to
[1:04:37] develop us into what what he wants us to
[1:04:39] be brother Mark but it but but just
[1:04:41] because you go through things don't mean
[1:04:43] God has stopped blessing you just
[1:04:45] because you're going through a trial
[1:04:46] don't mean God has stopped blessing you
[1:04:47] you're still a Son of God and you're
[1:04:49] still a daughter of God but you go
[1:04:50] through things so that God can shape you
[1:04:52] it's that that is a blessing of God if
[1:04:54] God would shape you and make you
[1:04:56] something greater you ought to consider
[1:04:58] it a blessing I'm going through a trial
[1:04:59] sometimes it's hard to look at the trial
[1:05:01] and say well this is God's blessing but
[1:05:02] God is blessing you by shaping you and
[1:05:04] molding you and bringing you into the
[1:05:06] image that he had for
[1:05:08] you see there's things in our life many
[1:05:11] things that brings about blessings and
[1:05:12] curses I could I'm not I'm not going to
[1:05:14] go through all these this morning
[1:05:15] because we got started a little late but
[1:05:17] maybe just to touch on on a couple but
[1:05:18] there's many scriptures in the Bible
[1:05:20] that speaks of the blessings of God and
[1:05:22] I I don't know about y'all but I say
[1:05:23] Amen into all of them am I the am I the
[1:05:26] only person that thinks that way I want
[1:05:28] every blessing that God has promised to
[1:05:30] this generation I want every bit of it I
[1:05:32] want I want all that God has to give
[1:05:34] I'll accept it Lord if you got something
[1:05:36] special for me this morning I want it if
[1:05:37] you got something Supernatural I want it
[1:05:39] if you got a miracle Lord I want it if
[1:05:41] you want to speak to My Heart Lord I
[1:05:42] want to hear from you I want the
[1:05:45] blessings of God on my life I want him
[1:05:47] to bless me in every aspect of my life I
[1:05:49] want him to bless my home I want him to
[1:05:50] bless my family I want him to bless my
[1:05:52] job I want him to bless the the church I
[1:05:54] want him to bless my children and my
[1:05:56] friends I I want to see the blessings of
[1:05:58] God I have a desire for it I say Amen to
[1:06:01] it all so the Bible says you are many
[1:06:04] curses and blessings we'll find many
[1:06:06] scriptures Malachi the third chapter can
[1:06:08] I show you some ways to receive a
[1:06:09] blessing from God Malachi third chapter
[1:06:12] said here bring in tithing to the
[1:06:13] storehouse that there may be meat in my
[1:06:15] house and prove me this is where God
[1:06:18] says challenge me sayeth the Lord if I
[1:06:20] will not open the windows of heaven and
[1:06:22] pour you out a blessing that there shall
[1:06:24] not be room enough to receive it that's
[1:06:27] a promise from God isn't that a
[1:06:29] wonderful promise here friends I could
[1:06:30] go through testimonies of our or spend
[1:06:32] hours of what God has done in my life
[1:06:34] from that one scripture many scriptures
[1:06:36] that bring blessings from God even
[1:06:38] children being obedient to your parents
[1:06:40] the Bible says honor your father and
[1:06:42] mother that thy days may be long upon
[1:06:44] the land that God gave you isn't it
[1:06:46] wonderful the that that that would bring
[1:06:48] an eternal life by honoring your father
[1:06:50] and mother Proverbs 11 said you can
[1:06:53] receive a blessing from from God by
[1:06:55] sowing into the lives of others say see
[1:06:57] he that scattereth increaseth but he
[1:06:59] that withholdeth he tendeth to Poverty
[1:07:02] he that WTH will also be watered isn't
[1:07:06] that wonderful see God's showing us ways
[1:07:09] even James four would write about it to
[1:07:11] receive a blessing he said well then
[1:07:13] pray and ask God for it for the right
[1:07:15] reasons say see you have not because you
[1:07:17] ask not and you ask and receive not
[1:07:19] because you ask a miss and you consume
[1:07:21] it by your own lust so here he shows us
[1:07:23] that it's God 's desire that you would
[1:07:25] be blessed and not cursed how many say
[1:07:27] Amen to that how many really believe
[1:07:29] that it's God's desire that you would be
[1:07:31] blessed and not be cursed I've heard so
[1:07:33] many people that that that that take
[1:07:35] this Bible and use it as a way to hold
[1:07:37] people and curse people but don't you
[1:07:39] realize it's not God's desire that his
[1:07:41] people would ever live under a curse it
[1:07:43] was God's desire that you would live
[1:07:44] under the blessings of God so see this
[1:07:47] is God's desire from the beginning when
[1:07:49] he made man you realize that when God
[1:07:51] created man man wasn't made under a
[1:07:53] curse
[1:07:54] he was made under a blessing he was
[1:07:57] blessed he lived in a in this Garden can
[1:07:58] I just preach just a few minutes he he
[1:08:00] lived in this Garden condition brother
[1:08:02] Mark it was a perfect condition he he
[1:08:04] could walk and have communion with God
[1:08:05] but because of the fall in the garden
[1:08:08] and when that man had fallen and Eden
[1:08:10] had fallen then it brought the curse of
[1:08:12] of the law of sin and death upon mankind
[1:08:15] see isn't it something that before that
[1:08:17] there was no curse but now because of
[1:08:19] that fall then every person that's born
[1:08:21] into this world is born under the same
[1:08:24] curse they're born under the curse of
[1:08:25] this flesh we battle with it we go we
[1:08:27] get up in the morning and we struggle
[1:08:29] with it we Face things that that are in
[1:08:30] this flesh because of the curse we get
[1:08:32] old and we and we try to find ways to
[1:08:34] make our make ourselves look young again
[1:08:36] we're trying to do everything you can to
[1:08:38] to to go against the curse that God has
[1:08:40] put on us because of the fall in the
[1:08:42] garden isn't it something this this is
[1:08:44] where the curse came from Brother Mar
[1:08:46] but the curse when it came you realize
[1:08:49] that it was from the fall of one man but
[1:08:51] the curse was to all mankind isn't it
[1:08:54] something that this curse it went to
[1:08:56] every family it went upon the whole
[1:08:58] world that received the same curse from
[1:09:01] the fall of one man in or one woman here
[1:09:04] when they they fa brother Mark this
[1:09:05] curse that came to every family there's
[1:09:07] nobody exempt from it you can't be born
[1:09:09] wealthy enough to be exempt from this
[1:09:11] curse it don't matter how much money you
[1:09:12] have your daddy could be the king over
[1:09:14] the greatest country but when you're
[1:09:16] born into this world you're born under
[1:09:17] the same curse and in a few years you'll
[1:09:19] leave this world and go right back to
[1:09:22] the dust that you came in
[1:09:24] see it's the curse that we're born under
[1:09:26] but isn't this something that God he
[1:09:28] would not leave the world in that kind
[1:09:30] of a curse see but God made a way for
[1:09:32] the curse to be removed he made a way
[1:09:34] for you to overcome it he made a way for
[1:09:36] it to be lifted I I thought isn't it
[1:09:38] something that here whenever God comes
[1:09:40] remember whenever God came and he began
[1:09:41] to deal with Abraham isn't it something
[1:09:43] that here was Abraham let me preach to
[1:09:45] you I'm I'm I'm about to get to my
[1:09:46] sermon but whenever God began to speak
[1:09:48] to Abraham do you realize that Abraham
[1:09:50] was born under the same curse you were
[1:09:52] born under how many Say Amen he was the
[1:09:54] same kind of man you are he was born
[1:09:56] under the same curse you were born under
[1:09:58] but when God came to talk to Abraham God
[1:10:00] didn't come and speak to Abraham about
[1:10:02] no curse he came to talk to Abraham
[1:10:04] about a blessing that he was going to
[1:10:06] put on his life here was a man that was
[1:10:08] born under a curse but when God come he
[1:10:11] said he was so blessed of God he said
[1:10:13] I'll even bless those that bless you and
[1:10:15] I'll curse those that curse you and in
[1:10:17] these shall all the families of the
[1:10:19] earth be blessed he was a man that was
[1:10:22] born under a curse but received a
[1:10:24] blessing from God listen he said in you
[1:10:26] shall all the families of the earth be
[1:10:28] blessed now how many knows what that
[1:10:29] word blessed means and that that word
[1:10:31] blessed you can read it in the Greek
[1:10:33] it's the word Barak B- a r a k Barack
[1:10:36] and so this word actually means to
[1:10:38] receive a blessing or to receive a gift
[1:10:40] from God and so this is what God is
[1:10:43] saying to Abraham he said in thee shall
[1:10:45] all the families of the earth be blessed
[1:10:47] in other words there's something inside
[1:10:49] of you that'll be a blessing it'll be a
[1:10:51] gift that I'll give to all to every
[1:10:53] family in the earth it was an
[1:10:54] opportunity where all the families were
[1:10:56] cursed it was a way that all the
[1:10:57] families would receive a blessing from
[1:10:59] God and Paul tells us what this blessing
[1:11:02] was just so it's not a mystery Paul said
[1:11:04] in Galatians the thir third chapter he
[1:11:07] said Christ has redeemed us from the
[1:11:09] curse of the law being made a curse for
[1:11:11] us for it is written cursed is everyone
[1:11:14] that hangeth on a tree that The Blessing
[1:11:17] of Abraham might come on the Gentiles
[1:11:20] through Jesus Christ that we might
[1:11:22] receive the promise of the spirit
[1:11:24] through faith isn't that something
[1:11:25] brother Mark see so he shows us that the
[1:11:27] promise of the spirit would be given not
[1:11:29] to the Natural Seed of Abraham but it
[1:11:32] would be given to the faith Seed of
[1:11:33] Abraham so it's not so here he would
[1:11:35] give this to us you say well well
[1:11:37] brother Matt if I was like Abraham well
[1:11:39] then I could be a real Christian you
[1:11:40] know if God had given me that promise
[1:11:42] like that well sure I'd be able to walk
[1:11:44] like Abraham walked If I Had The
[1:11:45] Blessing of Abraham then I'd be a then
[1:11:48] I'd be a real believer if I if I had
[1:11:49] that same promise he had but says see
[1:11:52] but you but you do have it if you're
[1:11:55] Christ's seed see you're dead in Christ
[1:11:57] you received the Holy Spirit you are
[1:11:59] Abraham's seed because Christ was
[1:12:01] Abraham seed you see that it puts it
[1:12:03] inside of us working that we can have
[1:12:05] faith in God here the very thing that
[1:12:07] God has promised to Abraham and in him
[1:12:10] that very thing that was in him in his
[1:12:12] seat he was speaking of Christ he said
[1:12:13] then the church by faith can have that
[1:12:15] same promise of God Paul said it was the
[1:12:17] promise of the Holy Spirit you said well
[1:12:20] brother Matt how do I know that I'm
[1:12:21] Abraham seed well let me give you an
[1:12:22] identifying characteristic brother B
[1:12:24] said to be Abraham's seed you would
[1:12:26] never back up at a promise of God now
[1:12:29] how means Abraham's seed he said to be
[1:12:31] Abraham's seed you'll always keep God's
[1:12:34] promise and you let that be the truth no
[1:12:37] matter what anything else said that's
[1:12:38] what Abraham did no matter what anybody
[1:12:40] said it didn't matter what they said it
[1:12:42] didn't mean nothing to him God said so
[1:12:44] and that settled it to Abraham he said
[1:12:46] so that's the way Abraham looked at
[1:12:48] things and that's the way Abraham's seed
[1:12:50] looks at things see so how many are
[1:12:52] Abraham's seed how many can say I'll let
[1:12:54] God's word be true and let everybody
[1:12:56] else's word be alive let God's word let
[1:12:59] it resonate in my heart and let every
[1:13:01] other word go that may if somebody would
[1:13:03] come by and they would say well well
[1:13:04] there ain't no God I'll take what God
[1:13:06] said about it if they say there ain't no
[1:13:08] such a thing as healing anymore I'll
[1:13:10] take what God said about it but you
[1:13:11] prayed over that lady and she died the
[1:13:13] next day I'll take what God said about
[1:13:15] it it don't matter how many fall or how
[1:13:18] many die or how many would go by the way
[1:13:20] of the Grave I'll take what God said
[1:13:21] about it he said he'll let God's word be
[1:13:24] true and let every man's word be a lie
[1:13:26] there ain't coming no Rapture we're too
[1:13:27] late in the age I've heard that for a
[1:13:29] hundred years there ain't going to be no
[1:13:30] such a thing as a Rapture that's just
[1:13:32] some book that men made I'll take what
[1:13:34] God Said and let every man's word be a
[1:13:36] liive this message ain't true anyway
[1:13:39] I'll take what God Said and let let
[1:13:42] every man's word be a liive I want to
[1:13:43] know how many today would say I'll take
[1:13:45] the word of God that's a true sign that
[1:13:48] you're the Seed of Abraham is you'll
[1:13:50] take the word of God over the voice of
[1:13:52] every man you'll take it over over the
[1:13:53] voice of every doubt of every every
[1:13:55] criticism of every every reasoning
[1:13:57] anything that Satan would bring to your
[1:13:59] mind you say I'll take the word of God
[1:14:02] over every voice over every reasoning
[1:14:05] over every Spirit I'll take the word of
[1:14:09] God see sometimes the people of God we
[1:14:11] get caught up in bad
[1:14:13] counsel amen
[1:14:15] somebody sometimes we get caught up with
[1:14:17] in bad counsel the Bible tells us the
[1:14:19] story of balam remember balum was here
[1:14:22] as a prophet as a minister that was out
[1:14:24] ministering to God's children the Bible
[1:14:27] tells us as as as balum would lead them
[1:14:30] and he led them in the wrong direction
[1:14:32] the Bible says that balam caused them to
[1:14:34] commit trespasses against the Lord
[1:14:36] because of his false
[1:14:38] teaching that they trespassed against
[1:14:40] God because of a false teaching and the
[1:14:43] Bible says that a plague Came Upon the
[1:14:46] whole
[1:14:47] congregation my isn't that something
[1:14:50] that here were innocent children that
[1:14:52] were caught up in a a plague because of
[1:14:55] uh trespasses that were committed by
[1:14:57] other people but a plague Came Upon the
[1:15:00] whole congregation I thought isn't that
[1:15:02] the way it was in the beginning the fall
[1:15:04] of one brought a curse to all people get
[1:15:07] so caught up in the curse for the market
[1:15:10] such a they look at the curse they're
[1:15:12] looking at the failures of the curse
[1:15:14] it's our feelings our emotions are
[1:15:16] caught up in it you we we have loved
[1:15:18] ones that go by the way of the Grave we
[1:15:20] get so caught up in in emotions because
[1:15:22] we're living in this curse we we we we
[1:15:24] we have these the feelings of this flesh
[1:15:26] we're we're just so caught up in it and
[1:15:29] and I thought my isn't it something that
[1:15:31] we we look at the curse and we look at
[1:15:32] the failures and we look at the problems
[1:15:34] and and we keep our eye on these things
[1:15:36] so many times and I thought my but if
[1:15:38] bad advice and false teaching could
[1:15:40] bring a congregation under a curse if if
[1:15:43] if that could bring the whole
[1:15:44] congregation under a curse then what
[1:15:46] would happen if the people had true
[1:15:48] teaching what would happen if they had a
[1:15:50] true Prophet if a false prophet could
[1:15:52] bring a curse upon the whole
[1:15:54] congregation or a plague on the
[1:15:55] congregation then what about a true
[1:15:57] Prophet isn't that the way it is so many
[1:15:58] people today say well beware of prophets
[1:16:00] the Bible didn't say that the Bible said
[1:16:02] Beware of false prophets thank God for
[1:16:04] the true ones thank God that there's men
[1:16:06] that God has used to be able to speak
[1:16:08] the word of God that you could be
[1:16:10] believe it as a Believer and bring the
[1:16:11] blessings of God upon your life and not
[1:16:14] live under a curse I thank God for True
[1:16:17] teaching I thank God for for true the
[1:16:19] true word of God I thank God today for
[1:16:21] True Holy Ghost filled men that still
[1:16:23] allow the spirit of God to fall upon
[1:16:25] them and anoint the preaching of the
[1:16:26] word I thank God for people that'll
[1:16:28] allow the anointing of God to come down
[1:16:30] in the church and begin to minister to
[1:16:32] their hearts I thank God that it ain't a
[1:16:33] ritual to us I thank God it ain't just
[1:16:35] something that we go do on Sunday and
[1:16:37] Wednesday to have something formal to
[1:16:39] have some status but we believe in the
[1:16:41] anointing of the baptism of the Holy
[1:16:43] Ghost we believe in the preaching of the
[1:16:45] Gospel of Jesus Christ I still believe
[1:16:48] God uses men to speak to our hearts I
[1:16:51] still believe God gets a hold of people
[1:16:52] I I still believe there's a people that
[1:16:54] cares enough about God that they'll
[1:16:56] listen to what God has to say I believe
[1:16:59] it I believe that everything's not a
[1:17:01] curse see they were overcame by a curse
[1:17:04] the the whole world they're overcame by
[1:17:06] a curse but I think it's time that we
[1:17:08] forget about the curse and be overcome
[1:17:10] by the blessings of God I think it's
[1:17:12] time to get our eyes off the curse and
[1:17:14] get our eyes on the blessing we ought to
[1:17:15] change the very things that we think and
[1:17:17] the things that we say every day look at
[1:17:19] the curse every day look at the flesh
[1:17:21] every day look at the fall every day
[1:17:23] look at my failure look at this look at
[1:17:25] the problems that I have but friends I
[1:17:27] think we ought to get up in the morning
[1:17:29] and every day say Lord I Thank you for
[1:17:31] the blessings that you brought to my
[1:17:33] life I thank you for my family I thank
[1:17:35] you for the church I go to I thank you
[1:17:38] for the preaching of the word I thank
[1:17:39] you for the gospel I thank you for men
[1:17:41] and women that'll stand for
[1:17:44] truth seems like all we talk about is
[1:17:47] the curse the curse the curse but I
[1:17:49] think we ought to change our speech Lord
[1:17:51] I Thank you in the face of a curse in in
[1:17:53] the face of the Flesh in the face of
[1:17:55] failures we ought to be able to overlook
[1:17:57] the failure and say Lord I Thank you for
[1:17:59] the blessings my I may not feel like
[1:18:01] praising God I don't feel like coming
[1:18:03] out from behind this pull pit but Lord I
[1:18:04] say thank you this morning I thank you
[1:18:06] for the blessing that you put on my life
[1:18:08] Lord I Thank you for the ability to get
[1:18:10] out of the way and allow you to speak to
[1:18:12] your children Lord I Thank you for your
[1:18:14] word I thank you for the Holy Ghost I
[1:18:17] think we ought to thank God for the many
[1:18:19] blessings that he give us if we ever get
[1:18:21] to a place Brother David where we come
[1:18:23] into the position with God that we can
[1:18:25] that we can receive the blessing of God
[1:18:28] I know who I am see this is where people
[1:18:30] have failed to understand the position
[1:18:33] that we're in the position you're in
[1:18:35] brings a blessing from God this is what
[1:18:38] Moses wrote Deuteronomy he said it shall
[1:18:40] come to pass they shall hearken
[1:18:42] diligently under the voice of the Lord
[1:18:44] they shall Lord thy God to observe and
[1:18:46] to do his Commandments which command
[1:18:48] thee this day that the Lord thy God will
[1:18:50] set thee high above the nations of the
[1:18:53] earth and all the blessings shall come
[1:18:56] on thee and overtake thee glory to God
[1:18:59] that makes me want to Shadow over this
[1:19:00] building the blessings of God will
[1:19:03] overtake thee anybody catch
[1:19:06] that that means to overcome you hello
[1:19:11] somebody that means the blessings of God
[1:19:13] will overcome you overtake means to
[1:19:16] overwhelm you overtake means to outshine
[1:19:20] you isin't that good to outshine you the
[1:19:22] very thing that the curse of this flesh
[1:19:24] and the way we look at ourselves but the
[1:19:26] blessings of God will outshine you it
[1:19:29] means to catch and to surpass your
[1:19:32] expectations that's what God said he
[1:19:35] said that the blessings of God would
[1:19:37] overtake you I don't know about you
[1:19:38] friends but I want to be overtook by the
[1:19:40] blessings of almighty God I say Lord
[1:19:43] overtake me Let It outshine My Flesh
[1:19:46] Lord let it out Shine the curse that I
[1:19:48] was born under Lord let it be be so
[1:19:50] overwhelmed by the blessings of God that
[1:19:52] I can't see the curses that are in this
[1:19:55] world he said I they'll overtake you and
[1:19:59] blessed you'll be in the city and bless
[1:20:00] you'll be in the field blessed shall be
[1:20:03] the fruit of your body and the fruit of
[1:20:05] the ground and the fruit of your cattle
[1:20:06] and the flocks of your sheep blessed
[1:20:08] shall you be in the baset and blessed
[1:20:09] shall you be in the store blessed shall
[1:20:11] you be when you come in and blessed you
[1:20:13] be when you go out now isn't that the
[1:20:16] way it is today people are fighting to
[1:20:18] receive this blessing from God Paul said
[1:20:21] it's God's Gift they're fighting to
[1:20:23] receive it but David I want to I want to
[1:20:25] be able to get it I I want to have that
[1:20:26] blessing I want the blessing of God to
[1:20:28] overtake me in such a way that I know
[1:20:30] who I am to bring me into my rightful
[1:20:32] place with God everybody wants to get it
[1:20:34] but you you realize friends but the
[1:20:36] reality is it ain't you getting it it's
[1:20:38] it getting you see we look at that wrong
[1:20:41] I'm going to go get it I'm I'm going to
[1:20:43] go track it down I'm going I'm going to
[1:20:44] lay a hold of the Holy Ghost I'm going
[1:20:46] to get a hold of God but it ain't you
[1:20:47] getting it it's it getting you what you
[1:20:50] do is just surrender to what God has
[1:20:52] sent over overtake you
[1:20:53] with but said heavens and earth have met
[1:20:58] God and man is reconciled and a restored
[1:21:01] Eden has begun see all the curse is gone
[1:21:06] amen all the curse is gone just like all
[1:21:09] the curse of sin is gone when the Holy
[1:21:11] Ghost accepts
[1:21:16] you man that makes me feel
[1:21:19] good just like the curse of sin is gone
[1:21:22] when the Holy Ghost accepts you see you
[1:21:25] don't accept it it accepts you see cuz
[1:21:29] it's God's attribute it's the Holy Ghost
[1:21:31] it means it's God's spirit it's the
[1:21:33] attribute the thought of God and he has
[1:21:35] accepted you because you were ordained
[1:21:38] for that
[1:21:40] purpose my you mean ordained yeah like
[1:21:43] Abraham was remember you don't you did
[1:21:46] you see whenever God came to Abraham
[1:21:48] Abraham didn't go to God and say Lord if
[1:21:50] you'll Lift Me Up and exalt I'll exalt
[1:21:52] thine name then if you'll make me a
[1:21:54] great nation I'll serve you then Lord if
[1:21:55] you'll make my name great I'll be
[1:21:57] something special it had nothing to do
[1:21:58] with what Abraham said the Bible says
[1:22:00] God came to Abraham and the Lord said to
[1:22:03] him it wasn't what Abraham said it was
[1:22:05] the Lord said he was ordained for it
[1:22:07] Abraham didn't choose God God chose
[1:22:08] Abraham somebody say amen he was an
[1:22:10] ordinary man living an ordinary life and
[1:22:13] God came down into his life he said I
[1:22:15] will make thee a great nation I Will
[1:22:17] Bless Thee I will make thy name great
[1:22:18] and you shall be a
[1:22:20] blessing all he did was choose to
[1:22:22] believe and he started walking in the
[1:22:24] blessing that God had called him to he
[1:22:26] could have went the wrong way he could
[1:22:27] have made mistakes he had flesh just
[1:22:29] like you and I but there was something
[1:22:31] down on the inside of him that was
[1:22:32] greater than the flesh it was greater
[1:22:34] than the curse he was born under it was
[1:22:36] something that God had called him to and
[1:22:38] friends let me tell you when God came in
[1:22:40] and said I will I will I will you shall
[1:22:43] Abraham said Lord I believe it and he
[1:22:45] started walking but Mar there was not
[1:22:47] one thing in this world that was going
[1:22:48] to stop him from taking another step he
[1:22:50] said I was giv a blessing by almighty
[1:22:53] God oh Abraham you're born under a curse
[1:22:55] but I've been blessed by God I'll take
[1:22:58] another step been blessed of God he said
[1:23:02] it's born you were born in sin and but
[1:23:06] God had that attribute and here you've
[1:23:08] expressed yourself here on Earth he
[1:23:10] comes down and he gets
[1:23:12] you it's God that accepts you see you're
[1:23:16] back here you're back here but here's
[1:23:18] where you belong and so God comes down
[1:23:21] and he gets you and he brings you to
[1:23:23] where you belong he says see now when
[1:23:26] God has a hold of you then sin has lost
[1:23:28] its power the desire of sin has gone
[1:23:31] from your heart when the Holy Spirit
[1:23:33] comes in and you are a restored
[1:23:37] person my why are you accepted man it
[1:23:40] makes me want to shout all over this
[1:23:42] building why are you accepted brother M
[1:23:44] cuz you was ordained to be accepted is't
[1:23:47] that something ordained for the purpose
[1:23:49] of being accepted by God by God that's
[1:23:52] my new favorite quote you was ordained
[1:23:54] for the purpose of being accepted by God
[1:23:57] isn't that always been the question that
[1:23:58] was the question that Cain and Abel had
[1:24:00] when they made their sacrifices would
[1:24:02] God accept their sacrifice remember Cain
[1:24:04] was upset because his wasn't accepted
[1:24:07] that's what happened with Solomon when
[1:24:08] he went and built the temple and he done
[1:24:10] everything according to the word of God
[1:24:11] and at the end of it and he went in the
[1:24:13] temple he said Lord would you come down
[1:24:15] and vindicate that you've accepted what
[1:24:17] we've done they were looking to be

[1:24:23] all those 450 prophets was looking for
[1:24:25] their God to come and be able to to be
[1:24:28] able to to burn the the altar but Elijah
[1:24:30] said let the god that anth by fire be
[1:24:32] God and then whenever he got the altar
[1:24:34] built he poured the water on it but Mark
[1:24:35] he done everything he prepared in every
[1:24:37] way he said Lord now God Of Heaven he
[1:24:39] said to prove that you've accepted the
[1:24:41] sacrifice would you come and light this

[1:24:53] accepted them by accepting their
[1:24:57] sacrifice my isn't that the question I
[1:24:59] wonder if God will accept me let me give
[1:25:01] you the answer I'm not going to preach

[1:25:06] purpose of being accepted by God Amen
[1:25:09] somebody I wonder if he'll accept my
[1:25:12] repentance you were ordained for the
[1:25:14] purpose of being accepted by God I
[1:25:16] wonder if he'll accept my worship you

[1:25:31] people rise up and say well you're just
[1:25:32] preaching a feel-good message well if it
[1:25:34] is one it's working cuz I feel pretty
[1:25:36] good about being ordained of being
[1:25:38] accepted by
[1:25:40] God I feel good about being accepted by
[1:25:42] God I feel good that I was ordained to
[1:25:45] be accepted by almighty God that means I
[1:25:48] was ordained that I couldn't be rejected
[1:25:50] I was ordained that I couldn't be cast
[1:25:52] side I was ordained that I couldn't be
[1:25:54] thrown away the world throws you away

[1:25:58] throw you away you when you fall I done
[1:26:01] fell so far I don't have nothing else to
[1:26:03] offer when you have nothing else to
[1:26:04] offer the the the boss will fire you
[1:26:07] when you get too old the'll throw you in
[1:26:08] a nursing home the world gets done with
[1:26:10] you God don't do it he was ordained for
[1:26:14] the purpose of being accepted by
[1:26:18] God how do I know God will accept me
[1:26:21] because of who you are
[1:26:24] my because of who you are Jesus preached
[1:26:28] the whole sermon I'm going close with
[1:26:30] this point Jesus preached a whole sermon
[1:26:33] on in Matthew the 5th chapter this is
[1:26:36] what I preached the series on a few
[1:26:37] years ago he said blessed are the poor
[1:26:40] in spirit blessed are the meek blessed
[1:26:43] are they which hunger and thirst blessed
[1:26:45] are the merciful blessed are the pure in
[1:26:48] heart blessed are the
[1:26:50] peacemakers see when you read this many
[1:26:53] Bible translations y'all remember when
[1:26:55] you read many of the translations
[1:26:57] actually interpret this as happy are
[1:26:59] those happy are the meek happy are the
[1:27:02] those that hunger and thirst after
[1:27:03] rightness but that is not even close to
[1:27:06] what that means they didn't just mean
[1:27:08] they're happy see there's a this word is
[1:27:11] so much deeper this word and not like
[1:27:13] Barack where it was just a gift but this
[1:27:16] word is the Greek word macaros how many
[1:27:18] remembers that a few years ago macaros
[1:27:21] it means that they are supremely blessed
[1:27:24] in other words by definition they were
[1:27:28] they were by extension blessed other
[1:27:30] words there was something that was a
[1:27:31] higher power that by extension of that
[1:27:35] higher power these people were a blessed
[1:27:37] people in other words they were
[1:27:39] fortunate many many would look at it in
[1:27:41] a carnal way and they'd say Well they're
[1:27:43] well off they're well off they're
[1:27:45] fortunate people matter of fact in the
[1:27:46] ancient days if You' read ancient texts
[1:27:48] and but you'll find out that when they
[1:27:50] Ed this word macaros in the Greek this
[1:27:52] word's actually used to describe people
[1:27:54] that that other people felt like they
[1:27:56] these people lived above the world they
[1:27:59] lived above worldly pressure they lived
[1:28:01] above all the the stresses of the world
[1:28:03] they were so well off that the things
[1:28:05] the ordinary things of Life had no
[1:28:07] effect on them at all this is the word
[1:28:09] maros they were they were just in a in
[1:28:12] another place it's almost when you read
[1:28:13] this in some old text it was almost as
[1:28:16] if they weren't even in this world this
[1:28:19] is them kind of people in the natural so
[1:28:23] when used properly you find this word
[1:28:25] maros is actually showing how God
[1:28:27] extended his benefits it's not an
[1:28:29] emotion it's not just God giving you a
[1:28:31] gift it's not just an outpouring of the
[1:28:33] spirit it's not but it's actually a
[1:28:35] position that you live in brother Mark
[1:28:37] tow when people would look at it and say
[1:28:40] that's the Blessed th those are those
[1:28:42] are the bless that's the that's the
[1:28:44] bless of God those are the those are the
[1:28:46] those are the Blessed people it
[1:28:47] describes the position of the Bride
[1:28:50] after receiving the favor of God so
[1:28:52] watch how we say it we say well if I do
[1:28:54] then I'll be blessed but that ain't the
[1:28:55] way it is but it's because you're
[1:28:57] blessed then you do it's because of who
[1:29:00] you are Jesus said blessed are the poor
[1:29:02] in spirit for theirs is the kingdom of
[1:29:03] God you are blessed you are the the
[1:29:05] Blessed of God that's why you are Meek
[1:29:07] that's why you that's why you are that's
[1:29:09] why you are humble that's why you do
[1:29:11] forgive that's why that's why you do uh
[1:29:14] you do have a pure heart that's why you
[1:29:16] are a peacemaker because you're the
[1:29:17] Blessed of God you don't become the
[1:29:19] Blessed because you are a peacemaker
[1:29:21] you're a Peacemaker because you are the
[1:29:23] Blessed this is the position that we're
[1:29:25] in matter of fact this name has such a
[1:29:28] great meaning this is the very same name
[1:29:30] that was given to God by Apostle Paul
[1:29:33] this is how he describes God the same
[1:29:35] word macaros he said according to the
[1:29:37] Glorious Gospel of the Blessed God which
[1:29:40] hath committed to my trust First Timothy
[1:29:43] un the appearing of our Lord Jesus
[1:29:45] Christ which in his times he shall show
[1:29:47] who is the blessed and the only
[1:29:49] potentate the king of kings and the Lord
[1:29:52] of host Now isn't it something that the
[1:29:54] same word that Paul uses to describe God
[1:29:58] is the same word that Jesus uses to
[1:30:00] describe
[1:30:02] you that's hard to swallow isn't it Paul
[1:30:05] used this word said this is what God is
[1:30:07] he's a blessed God Jesus uses this word
[1:30:09] to Define you blessed are the poor in
[1:30:12] spirit blessed are the meek blessed are
[1:30:15] the humble blessed are the peacemakers
[1:30:17] ain't it something see it's hard for us
[1:30:19] to look at oursel that way is that when
[1:30:22] I said that I could feel that all over
[1:30:23] the building that you mean Paul called
[1:30:25] God that and now he's calling it yeah
[1:30:27] but that was God this is you know we're
[1:30:29] people after all we were born under a
[1:30:31] curse after all we're a part of creation
[1:30:33] after all we have failures after all I
[1:30:35] live in the flesh see it's hard to
[1:30:38] accept that it's hard to say yeah I I'll
[1:30:40] accept being called that because you
[1:30:42] know I I barely get by being a Christian
[1:30:44] I can hardly get get through one day to
[1:30:45] another you see I found in the scripture
[1:30:48] there was another person that was used
[1:30:50] to the same name was used to describe it
[1:30:53] was when the angel came to a little girl
[1:30:55] by the name of Mary and when Gabriel
[1:30:58] came to her friends do you realize that
[1:31:00] Gabriel came to Mary not because of how
[1:31:02] good Mary was but because of who Mary
[1:31:05] was it wasn't out all the works that she
[1:31:08] had done and how the effort that she had
[1:31:10] put it was because of who she was matter
[1:31:12] of fact when the angel came to her the
[1:31:14] Bible says he said there are highly
[1:31:16] favored the Lord is with thee and
[1:31:17] blessed art thou among women see the
[1:31:20] angel he didn't tell her you're going to
[1:31:22] receive a blessing he said you are
[1:31:24] blessed macaros he said blessed art thou
[1:31:28] among women TR think of this this is how
[1:31:31] she felt just like you feel when I say
[1:31:33] that about you she felt the same way she
[1:31:35] said the Bible says she was troubled at
[1:31:37] his saying and she said cast in her mind
[1:31:40] what kind of greeting is this and the
[1:31:41] angel said to her fear not for you have
[1:31:43] found favor with God is't that something
[1:31:46] you can find yourself in this whole
[1:31:47] story God says you're a blessed people
[1:31:49] Lord I know but look at look at my life
[1:31:52] and look at the condition look at what I
[1:31:54] what the the the mistakes I've made look
[1:31:56] at my past look where I've been he says
[1:31:58] but fear not for you have found favor
[1:32:00] can somebody put theirself in this story
[1:32:02] this morning this is for you but fear
[1:32:04] not you have found favor with God and
[1:32:07] behold that shall you shall conceive in
[1:32:09] thy womb and bring forth the son and you
[1:32:11] shall call his name Jesus and he'll be
[1:32:13] great and he'll be called the son of the
[1:32:15] highest and the Lord will give him the
[1:32:16] Throne of David and he'll Reign Over The
[1:32:18] House of Israel and the kingdom there
[1:32:20] shall be no end then said marri to the
[1:32:22] angel how shall this be why because
[1:32:25] she's just like us how can that be how
[1:32:29] can that happen to somebody like me now
[1:32:31] watch what the angel does to prove it to
[1:32:33] her he starts to testify to her of
[1:32:36] Supernatural and he starts to share
[1:32:37] testimonies of what God has already done
[1:32:39] I love the Angel's answer maybe you've
[1:32:41] never just slowed down and read it but
[1:32:43] the Bible says the angel answered unto
[1:32:44] her how can this be he said the Holy
[1:32:47] Ghost shall come upon thee isn't that
[1:32:49] something it overtook her the Holy Ghost
[1:32:51] shall come upon you it wasn't something
[1:32:53] that she accepted it was something that
[1:32:55] accepted her say see there it wasn't
[1:32:57] something she went to get brother Mark
[1:32:59] she couldn't go work it up and make it
[1:33:00] happen it accepted her he said the Holy
[1:33:02] Ghost shall come upon thee the power of
[1:33:05] the highest shall overshadow you
[1:33:08] therefore the holy thing that shall be
[1:33:10] born of thee shall be called The Son of
[1:33:11] God and behold thy cousin Elizabeth she
[1:33:15] has conceived a son in her old age and
[1:33:17] is in her sixth month with her child and
[1:33:19] she was called baren so so he tells her
[1:33:22] what's going to happen to her and
[1:33:24] vindicates it by telling her a testimony
[1:33:26] of a baren woman that's all of a sudden
[1:33:27] having a child and the Bible says and
[1:33:30] then Mary listen as she's hearing this
[1:33:33] the angel says even though it seems like
[1:33:36] that you're not that even though it
[1:33:37] seems like you're lowly even though it
[1:33:39] seems like you're under a curse but the
[1:33:42] angel says but for with God nothing
[1:33:45] shall be impossible so you know what
[1:33:47] that tells me it don't matter how bad
[1:33:49] you are or what kind of curse you're
[1:33:51] under or how bad the devil's made you
[1:33:54] feel like you are if you're part of the
[1:33:56] Bride of Jesus Christ you're not what
[1:33:57] the devil says about you say see with
[1:34:00] God nothing shall be impossible he can
[1:34:02] get you out of the lowest hole he can go
[1:34:04] to the lowest pit let me tell you
[1:34:06] something about my God my God can walk
[1:34:08] right in a drug housee and drag somebody
[1:34:10] out of it he'll overtake them my God can
[1:34:12] take somebody off a bar stol and bring
[1:34:14] them in the house of God and set them
[1:34:16] and establish them in the word of God
[1:34:18] why he has the ability to overtake you
[1:34:20] sir
[1:34:22] said before God nothing shall be
[1:34:24] impossible how many remembers what Mary
[1:34:26] said she said well be it unto me
[1:34:29] according to Thy word why cuz she was a
[1:34:32] Seed of Abraham I'll let the word of God
[1:34:35] be be greater than the word of any man
[1:34:37] maybe there was some around her Mary you
[1:34:38] can't do that be it unto me according to
[1:34:40] Thy word Mary you're just a little girl
[1:34:42] be it unto me according to Thy word Mary
[1:34:44] you're you're a nobody you're just
[1:34:46] raised in a in a in a messed up family
[1:34:47] be it unto me according to Thy word I'll
[1:34:50] take the word of God God over what
[1:34:52] anybody says because she was a Seed of
[1:34:55] Abraham and the Bible says Mary went
[1:34:57] down she be to testify to Elizabeth of
[1:34:59] all the things that she had just seen
[1:35:00] and it wasn't very long them two
[1:35:02] pregnant ladies was having a Pentecostal
[1:35:04] Jubilee right down in the living room
[1:35:06] they they began to shout and praising
[1:35:07] God and Elizabeth began to talk about
[1:35:09] how wonderful God is she said my Mary
[1:35:12] with a loud voice she said blessed art
[1:35:14] thou the Bible says and Mary said my
[1:35:15] soul magnifies the Lord and my spirit
[1:35:18] has rejoiced in God the Savior you said
[1:35:20] what were they shouting about why was
[1:35:22] there so much joy why why why what
[1:35:24] caused the Revival in
[1:35:26] Mary the Bible says listen can we show
[1:35:29] this scripture Luke the first chapter
[1:35:31] brother Tim Luke the first chapter 48th
[1:35:35] verse Mary said listen what she said
[1:35:38] what what caused a jubilee for he hath
[1:35:40] regarded the lowest state of his
[1:35:42] handmaiden for behold from hence forth
[1:35:45] all generations shall call me blessed
[1:35:49] isn't it something listen what CED the
[1:35:51] joy to come to marry God has regarded my
[1:35:56] estate God saw me in this condition God
[1:36:00] knew I would be in this curse God knew I
[1:36:04] would be born to who I would be born to
[1:36:05] God knew I would go through the things
[1:36:07] that I would go through he saw me in
[1:36:09] this lowest state but from now on all
[1:36:13] generations shall call me blessed my
[1:36:16] what a jubilee it brought see first it
[1:36:18] was how I see me and second it's how God
[1:36:21] sees me may you stand to your feet this
[1:36:23] morning see because of who she was
[1:36:25] listen Mary didn't go around saying a
[1:36:27] virgin shall conceive a virgin shall
[1:36:29] conceive she went and she manifested
[1:36:31] what God said about her see there's a
[1:36:33] lot of people go around quoting stuff
[1:36:35] but there a difference between quoting
[1:36:36] something and living something that's
[1:36:38] like we today we don't go around saying
[1:36:41] the just shall live by faith the just
[1:36:42] shall live by faith we don't just go
[1:36:43] around saying it me we tell you what the
[1:36:45] bride does she lives by faith we don't
[1:36:48] go around well after all Jesus is the
[1:36:50] same yesterday today and for forever we
[1:36:51] don't just go around quoting it but we
[1:36:53] live it and let the life of Jesus Christ
[1:36:56] be manifested in you you see that's what
[1:36:58] the world wants to see they want to see
[1:37:00] something real you say well brother man
[1:37:03] well that was Mary she was highly
[1:37:04] favored what about me what about you can
[1:37:06] I answer that that was Mary she was
[1:37:08] highly favored but what about me where's
[1:37:11] my Gabriel everybody's looking for their
[1:37:14] angel where's my Gabriel to come and and
[1:37:16] say I was blessed in that way to come
[1:37:18] and meet me on the road and say you're
[1:37:20] blessed and highly favored friends I got
[1:37:22] something this morning that's a lot
[1:37:23] greater than
[1:37:24] Gabriel you remember when Jesus was
[1:37:26] preaching remember he went out brother
[1:37:28] Mark and the woman screamed out while he
[1:37:31] was preaching she saw the Miracles that
[1:37:32] were done and she screamed out she said
[1:37:34] blessed is the womb that bear thee and
[1:37:37] the breast that nurse thee and Jesus
[1:37:39] turned to her he said yay but rather I
[1:37:43] say blessed are they that hear the word
[1:37:44] of God and keep it my isn't this
[1:37:47] something Mary was blessed but Jesus
[1:37:49] said but more blessed are they that hear
[1:37:51] the word and keep it see the word is a
[1:37:53] seed just like Mary there was a seed
[1:37:55] that was placed in her it was the
[1:37:56] literal life of God and that word was
[1:37:58] made flesh and it was placed in the womb
[1:38:00] of a woman here she as being a top of
[1:38:02] the Bride of Jesus Christ how many knows
[1:38:04] that that the that the word would be
[1:38:06] placed into the the womb of the heart of
[1:38:08] the Bride that and that word as Jesus
[1:38:10] said it was a seed it would be placed in
[1:38:12] her and there wouldn't be no other seed
[1:38:13] that's Mary was a virgin was a virgin
[1:38:16] whenever the seed was placed there he
[1:38:17] said see it would come to a virgin
[1:38:19] virgin birth said that's the same way it
[1:38:21] is with a bride she wouldn't allow any
[1:38:23] other seed we're not they're not going
[1:38:24] to allow something else to come in or
[1:38:26] some some Doctrine or some foolishness
[1:38:28] of man where Abraham seed there ain't
[1:38:30] but one seed it's Christ the word
[1:38:31] that'll ever be placed into the womb of
[1:38:33] the Bride of Jesus Christ she see it's
[1:38:36] because of who you are and I think isn't
[1:38:38] it something that the bride has carried
[1:38:40] that word the seed that was planted he
[1:38:43] this this body of Believers the Bride of
[1:38:46] Jesus Christ she's carried that word and
[1:38:48] we've saw it come to life brother the
[1:38:49] mark even in the time that that we live
[1:38:51] in as it as it's grown in the hearts of
[1:38:53] Believers how many say brother Matt I'm
[1:38:55] glad to be a part of that let me read
[1:38:58] this as we're closing brother Braham
[1:39:01] said here's the secret how many wants to
[1:39:03] hear it he said here's the secret the
[1:39:06] word is in the bride and the mind of
[1:39:10] Christ to know what he wants done with
[1:39:12] the word and she does it in his name she
[1:39:15] has thus sayith the Lord then it's
[1:39:20] deratization serves his purpose and then
[1:39:22] they will do only his will and no one
[1:39:25] can persuade them different I is this
[1:39:27] something brother the David the Bride is
[1:39:29] a blessed
[1:39:30] people for the word of God is in her and
[1:39:34] the mind of God is in her to know what
[1:39:38] he wants done with it my I think that's
[1:39:40] just that's just a a powerful thought
[1:39:43] this morning the word is in you and the
