[39:16] name. Praise his
[39:19] name. He's in the
[39:23] house. Amen. Won't somebody praise the
[39:25] name of the Lord this morning? How many
[39:27] say he's worthy to be praised? Amen.
[39:30] Paul said, "We are troubled on every
[39:32] side yet not distressed. When we're
[39:34] perplexed, we're not in despair.
[39:37] Persecuted, but we're not forsaken. And
[39:39] cast down, but not destroyed." said,
[39:42] "Because we have this life of Jesus
[39:44] Christ that's been made manifest in this
[39:46] body of flesh." How many believe that it
[39:48] may be trouble everywhere, but the Bible
[39:50] says that the Lord's mercies are not
[39:52] with it's by his mercies that we're not
[39:54] consumed. And I believe that this
[39:55] morning, we may go through trials and
[39:57] tribulation, but God's compassion never
[39:59] fails us. So, we just say, Lord, we just
[40:02] open up our heart to you. And may you
[40:05] open your heart of compassion unto us
[40:07] and let your hand of mercy move amongst
[40:09] your children this morning. I believe
[40:11] God is a merciful God and we certainly
[40:13] appreciate all that he's doing for us
[40:15] even in the time of distress and and
[40:19] troubles that I know many is going
[40:20] through uh that's been affected by the
[40:23] flooding and the tornadoes and uh we
[40:26] certainly had had some damage here on
[40:29] the the church grounds but uh nothing
[40:32] compared to what many have been going
[40:34] through. So just want to keep them in
[40:35] our prayers. Um brother David Gates had
[40:38] asked the church to pray pray this
[40:39] morning. and I spoke to him. Uh they had
[40:41] about 3 in of water in their downstairs
[40:43] part of their house this morning. And so
[40:46] just uh I know there was some bringing
[40:48] some vacuums and stuff like that trying
[40:50] to help them and uh but we just want to
[40:53] remember them in prayer. Also had a
[40:56] McKenzie said she wanted to praise the
[40:58] Lord. Just thankful God has kept kept
[41:00] them safe uh through all the the floods
[41:03] and things. I believe that's what all of
[41:05] us have that on our heart this morning
[41:07] to thank him for what he's done for us.
[41:10] Um, also remember, pray for uh healing.
[41:13] Uh, Paige's dad is in the ICU in Little
[41:16] Rock. Um, also, Sister Mandy is sick
[41:18] this morning and just pray the Lord
[41:21] would touch her body and she was sick
[41:23] yesterday and came up here and cleaned
[41:24] the church. So, bless her heart, but we
[41:27] just ask the Lord that he would touch
[41:29] her body and give her strength. And I
[41:30] know there's many more that are sick,
[41:32] being affected by the floods and storms
[41:34] and things. So, I just want to remember
[41:36] them in prayer. And I also want to say
[41:38] thank you to the brothers. Uh we have
[41:40] several brothers in our church that are
[41:42] first responders and uh and working and
[41:45] helping during the storms, going out in
[41:46] the middle of the night and stuff. So,
[41:48] God bless you, brothers, for for that
[41:50] and and being a
[41:53] help. Amen. So, let's just bow our heads
[41:56] together. If you have a need on your
[41:57] heart this morning, I believe God is
[41:59] certainly mindful of what we have need
[42:01] of. And let's just call upon him. Lord
[42:03] Jesus, Lord, how we love you this
[42:06] morning. And God, we thank you, Lord,
[42:08] for the privilege to come and gather
[42:11] together with believers and brothers and
[42:13] sisters, Lord. And God, how our faith,
[42:16] Lord, is strong this morning. And God,
[42:19] it's been strengthened by your word. And
[42:22] Lord, we just ask you, Lord, that you
[42:23] would meet every need, Lord, knowing
[42:25] those that are sick and have need of
[42:27] you. And Lord, we pray that you would
[42:29] touch everybody. You would heal the
[42:30] sick. And Lord, we just ask, Lord, that
[42:33] your hand of mercy would be upon us in
[42:35] this area. And Lord, we just want to be
[42:38] able to be a light, Lord, in the time of
[42:40] darkness. And Lord, we just pray, Lord,
[42:42] that you'd give us the strength to do
[42:44] just that. And Lord, we realize, Lord,
[42:46] if there was no darkness, Lord, no one
[42:48] would ever recognize the light. And
[42:50] Lord, if there was no trials, we'd never
[42:53] recognize your your mercy and ability to
[42:55] bring us through it. And but Lord, we
[42:57] just ask you this morning to give us
[42:59] strength, Lord, in the body of
[43:00] believers. And Lord, touch each one.
[43:02] Help them now in the name of Jesus
[43:04] Christ, we pray. Amen. Amen. You love
[43:08] the Lord this morning. Amen. How many
[43:11] say it's good to be in the house of the
[43:12] Lord? Won't you turn around, shake
[43:13] somebody's hand, and greet them in the
[43:15] name of the Lord Jesus, the goodness of
[43:17] God. Amen. Amen. And I just want to say
[43:21] um happy anniversary to my wife and we
[43:25] went away on our our trip last weekend.
[43:28] We were gone and got to uh spend our
[43:30] 22nd wedding anniversary. So uh
[43:32] certainly appreciate her for putting up
[43:34] with me for for 22 years. And and won't
[43:37] y'all give her a hand? Isn't that a
[43:38] quite a job?
[43:41] Amen. Isn't that right, brother Dave?
[43:44] You can put up with me for 22 years. You
[43:46] deserve a hand. Amen. I asked her when
[43:49] we was on our trip. I said, "Which years
[43:50] were the best?" She's like, "Well, let's
[43:52] not go down that road. We'll just leave
[43:54] some of them in the past and thank the
[43:56] Lord for the ones we got upcoming." So,
[43:58] I never really got a good answer out of
[44:00] her. But, but some were wonderful and
[44:04] I'm I'm more of a trutht teller. Some
[44:06] days are they're great and some days you
[44:08] you wonder how in the world you got into
[44:10] that mess, but the Lord brings you
[44:11] through all of it and makes a makes a
[44:13] great marriage and a great uh partner to
[44:15] spend your life with. And uh so I
[44:17] certainly thank God for my wife and and
[44:20] the and what he's g a gift that he gave
[44:22] me, the greatest gift that God ever gave
[44:24] me outside the Holy Ghost. I believe
[44:26] that. And uh so I appreciate her putting
[44:29] up with me and and she's been a made a
[44:32] lot of sacrifices to uh be here and and
[44:36] you know, a lot of uh time that I'm not
[44:39] home or on the phone. I spend a lot of
[44:41] time working and helping other people.
[44:42] And sometimes you spend more time with
[44:44] other people's families than you do your
[44:45] own. and and but we believe it's God's
[44:48] work and and she's been a very big part
[44:50] of that and working and uh taking time
[44:53] and helping and so we just uh really
[44:55] appreciate really appreciate her. Amen.
[44:58] Always good. A good wife is the best
[45:00] thing you could have and a bad one God
[45:03] help you but but I thank God for this
[45:06] morning. You love the Lord. Amen. Sorry
[45:09] to take up time, but but sometimes you
[45:11] you you got to I got the microphone, so
[45:14] that's a dangerous thing sometimes, but
[45:16] um Amen. We just appreciate each one of
[45:18] you. How many's looking forward for the
[45:20] word this morning? Amen. Brother Aaron
[45:22] will come and brought his wife and
[45:24] daughter with him this morning. She's
[45:26] actually part of the family, the
[45:27] daughter. So, she brought her dad and
[45:28] mom here this morning. Sister Leah's
[45:31] here a lot of times. So, but we just
[45:33] look forward to what God has in store.
[45:35] So, we just want to invite him to come.
[45:37] Can we sing goodness of God?
[45:40] Amen. I love you,
[45:44] Lord. Oh, your mercy never fails
[45:49] me. All my days I've been held in your
[45:56] hands. From the moment that I wake
[46:00] up till I lay my
[46:03] head. Yes, I will.
[46:07] In the goodness of
[46:11] God, I say cuz all my life you have been
[46:18] faithful. How many can say that this
[46:20] morning? All my life you have been so so
[46:27] good. With every breath that I am
[46:32] able, I will sing of the goodness of
[46:37] [Laughter]
[46:39] God. I will sing of the goodness of
[46:46] God. I love your voice. Thank you, Lord.
[46:51] You have led me through many
[46:55] fires and in the darkest night you've
[46:59] been close like no
[47:02] other. I've known you as a
[47:05] father. I've known you as a
[47:09] friend and I have believed in the
[47:13] goodness of God.
[47:19] All my life you have been
[47:22] faithful. Yes, my
[47:25] Lord. All my life.
[47:28] [Music]
[47:51] How many can testify this morning that
[47:53] all your life he's been faithful? Amen.
[47:56] You know, the scripture tells us that
[47:58] many are the afflictions of the
[48:00] righteous. If we stopped right there,
[48:02] that would be a sad story. But it says,
[48:05] "But he deliverth them out of them all."
[48:08] Amen. I found that to be the truth. I
[48:11] found him to be the truth. Amen. Amen.
[48:15] Let's Let's go to him in prayer.
[48:18] Father, how we love you this morning.
[48:19] How how thankful we are, Lord, for your
[48:21] presence, Lord. How thankful we are,
[48:24] Lord, for this congregation and this
[48:25] church, Lord, this this lighthouse here,
[48:28] Father. Lord, that shines the light,
[48:30] Lord, that there is a truth. There is a
[48:32] living God, Lord. We thank you for this
[48:35] place. We thank you for his pastor,
[48:36] Lord, for every member that comes here,
[48:38] Lord. Father, I just I look around,
[48:41] Lord, and I see, Lord, the storms that
[48:44] have been stacking up, Lord, physically,
[48:47] spiritually, naturally, Lord, I just
[48:49] pray that you'd raise up a standard,
[48:51] Father. Lord, that you would just move
[48:53] in a mighty way, Lord, because we
[48:55] recognize this is the Lord's work, and
[48:56] we're just asking that your hand will
[48:58] move and stay the storms, Lord. And that
[49:01] all through all of this, Lord, that
[49:03] it'll work out for our good as your word
[49:05] says it will. Father, we commit Lord
[49:07] these people, Lord, this day, this
[49:10] service, ourselves, and all that we have
[49:13] into your hands. Lord, we ask you to
[49:15] come now and break the bread of life and
[49:18] speak to us. Lord, encourage us, lift us
[49:20] up, Lord. May our faith be elevated
[49:22] today to the level of the promise so
[49:24] that we can go home, Lord, as possessors
[49:27] of the promises today. Father, we commit
[49:30] it to you now, Lord, in Jesus name.
[49:32] Amen. Amen. If you have your Bibles with
[49:35] you this morning and you turn with me to
[49:37] the book of Colossians, I believe I
[49:39] accidentally told them Corinthians, but
[49:41] we're looking Colossians this morning 1
[49:44] and verse 12. And while you're turning,
[49:46] I just want to take a moment to share my
[49:49] appreciation and my love uh for your for
[49:52] your pastor, brother Matt. We've just
[49:54] really grown to appreciate him and the
[49:56] friendship that we have and and for for
[49:59] his entire family and for the people
[50:01] here. We we really enjoy coming here. We
[50:04] love you with the love of the Lord and
[50:05] we're thankful every time we have the
[50:07] opportunity. You're a wonderful group to
[50:08] preach to. Wonderful group of of
[50:10] Christian people. We sure love and
[50:12] appreciate you and we bring greetings
[50:14] this morning from our home church and
[50:15] from our pastor, Brother Tim. Sends his
[50:17] love and greetings and Amen. We just
[50:20] want to tell you how much we we do
[50:21] appreciate you. I'm thankful to have my
[50:23] wife and daughter with me this morning
[50:24] and to to travel along. Like brother
[50:27] Matt said, Aaliyah, let us come this
[50:28] time. So So here we are. Amen. So, I'd
[50:32] like to speak to you for a moment this
[50:34] morning on on the thought our eternal
[50:37] source. Our eternal source. And we're
[50:39] going to read from several places in the
[50:41] scripture if that's all right. Starting
[50:42] here in Colossians
[50:44] 1:12 says, "Giving thanks unto the
[50:47] Father, which hath made us meat to be
[50:49] partakers of the inheritance of the
[50:51] saints in light, who hath delivered us
[50:54] from the power of darkness, and hath
[50:56] translated us into the kingdom of his
[50:58] dear son, in whom we have redemption
[51:01] through his blood, even the forgiveness
[51:03] of sins, who is the image of the
[51:05] invisible God, the firstborn of every
[51:08] creature. For by him were all things
[51:10] created that are in heaven and that are
[51:12] in earth, visible and invisible, whether
[51:14] they be thrones or dominions or
[51:16] principalities or powers. All things
[51:18] were created by him and for him. And he
[51:22] is before all things and by him all
[51:26] things consist. Amen. I'd like to read
[51:29] one verse in the the book of Romans.
[51:31] Romans 11:36. I'm just going to read one
[51:34] verse. there says for of him and through
[51:37] him and to him are all things to whom be
[51:41] glory forever. Amen. Amen. And you know
[51:45] it says it's very clear. He created all
[51:47] things in heaven. He created all things
[51:49] in earth. He is before all things. All
[51:51] things are of him. All things are to
[51:53] him. I think it's easy for us to say
[51:55] this morning that God is everything. And
[51:57] not only is he everything, he is our
[51:59] everything. Amen. Amen. And one last
[52:02] place if if you don't mind in the book
[52:03] of Job, we're going to look at Job 38
[52:06] and verse 1-7. It says, "Then the Lord
[52:08] answered Job out of the whirlwind and
[52:10] said, "Who is it that darkeneth counsel
[52:13] by words without knowledge? Gird up now
[52:15] thy loins like a man, for I will demand
[52:18] of thee, and answer thou me? Where was
[52:20] thou when I laid the foundations of the
[52:22] earth? Declare if thou hast
[52:25] understanding? Who hath laid the
[52:27] measures thereof? If thou knowest, or
[52:29] who hath stretched the line upon it?
[52:31] Whereupon are the foundations thereof
[52:33] fastened? Or who laid the cornerstone
[52:35] thereof? When the morning stars sang
[52:38] together, and all the sons of God
[52:41] shouted for joy. Amen. I pray that the
[52:44] Lord will add his blessing to the
[52:45] reading of the word as you have your
[52:47] seats this
[52:48] morning. Amen.
[52:51] Ain't it wonderful as you sit there and
[52:53] read there in the book of Job to realize
[52:54] that you have already been seen in the
[52:57] eternals. Amen. And and you weren't seen
[52:59] there defeated. You weren't seen there
[53:02] trotten down and saddened and coming in
[53:04] by the skin of your teeth. But it says
[53:06] that you were there shouting for joy.
[53:08] Amen. To me, it looks like we're a bunch
[53:10] of overcomers. Amen. Despite what the
[53:13] devil may be telling you, despite the
[53:14] trials and tribulations you may be
[53:16] facing today, you've already seen the
[53:18] end of the story. And you're seen there
[53:20] in victory. Amen. Amen. Brother Brandham
[53:23] tells us, he says, he says, "And as he
[53:25] being the groom, the bride has to come
[53:27] forth because it's part of him." And it
[53:30] can only be the manifestation of the
[53:32] fulfilling of all the revelations of any
[53:36] others has spoke of the bride. It can
[53:38] only manifest if it does something
[53:40] different from the groom, it isn't the
[53:42] bride because she is flesh of his flesh,
[53:45] bone of his bone, life of his life,
[53:46] power of his power. She is him. Amen.
[53:51] Amen. So this morning, in one way, you
[53:53] look at that and you go, "My goodness,
[53:54] we got a lot to live up to." And there
[53:56] there's a lot of pressure. But
[53:58] understand this. God never asked you to
[53:59] do anything without providing the way
[54:01] for you to be that. If he said that's
[54:03] what you're going to be, then he's going
[54:04] to make it that well. He's going to make
[54:06] the way. He's going to provide what you
[54:08] have need of in order to meet that
[54:10] standard. Amen. Amen. So, we're speaking
[54:12] this morning on our eternal source. And
[54:15] and so, I want to look at a definition.
[54:17] What is a source? A source is where
[54:20] something can be attained. But it also
[54:23] means where something comes from,
[54:24] meaning its origin. In other words, you
[54:27] can go down here to the to the the
[54:28] dollar store or whatever, and you can
[54:30] pick up a bottle of Dr. Pepper, and
[54:32] that's your source. That's that's where
[54:34] you got it. But where was its source?
[54:36] That dollar store ain't it source. It
[54:38] came from a a certain location, a
[54:40] certain place where it was made and
[54:42] manufactured. So, so a source can be
[54:44] where you attain something, but it's
[54:46] also where something originated from.
[54:49] Amen. And, and as we look at this, you
[54:51] know, man has always search for things
[54:53] in this world to make him happy. He's
[54:55] always searched for peace and they've
[54:57] always searched for life. But, but the
[54:59] problem is man has always searched in
[55:01] the wrong places. Amen. You know, you
[55:04] look around at the world today and the
[55:05] insanity and the things people are doing
[55:07] and in reality, that's what they're
[55:09] doing is they're they're searching for
[55:10] happiness. They're searching for peace.
[55:13] They're thirsting for life. They They
[55:14] don't want to be crazy people. They
[55:16] don't want to be unhappy people. They're
[55:18] searching for for happiness and peace
[55:21] and joy and they're searching for the
[55:23] things that we have. Amen. They just
[55:25] don't know where to search this morning.
[55:27] Amen. Amen. But they search in all the
[55:29] wrong places and and they search for
[55:31] things down through history like the
[55:33] fountain of youth so that they could
[55:35] live forever. You know, men like Pon
[55:38] DeLeon are recorded in history searching
[55:40] for a source of supernatural life. And I
[55:43] was looking at that and it says, you
[55:45] know, the fountain of youth is a
[55:46] mythical spring which allegedly restores
[55:49] the youth of anyone who drinks or bathes
[55:51] in its waters. Tales of such a fountain
[55:54] have been recounted around the world for
[55:56] hundreds and thousands of years,
[55:58] appearing in the writings of Herodotus
[56:00] in the fifth century and in the stories
[56:02] of Prester John in the 11th and 12th
[56:04] century. Stories of similar waters were
[56:07] featured prominently among the people of
[56:09] the Caribbean during the age of
[56:11] exploration says they spoke of the
[56:13] restorative powers of water in the
[56:16] mythical land of Bammeni. Based on these
[56:18] legends, explorers and adventurers
[56:20] looked for the elusive fountain of youth
[56:22] or some other remedy to aging generally
[56:25] associated with magic waters. said,
[56:28] "These waters might have been a river, a
[56:30] spring, or any other water source said
[56:32] to reverse the aging process and to cure
[56:35] sickness when swallowed or bathed in."
[56:39] Well, I bring you some good news this
[56:41] morning, Brother Mark. I found the real
[56:43] thing. There is a real source of life.
[56:46] There is a real fountain of youth. And I
[56:48] didn't have to go on a world exploration
[56:50] to find it. Matter of fact, he came
[56:52] looking for me. He brought it to me. I
[56:55] bet you you think, "Well, how expensive
[56:57] was it?" The price was already paid. It
[57:00] was eternal life. And listen, this water
[57:02] will keep you young. It'll heal the
[57:04] sick. It'll restore families. And I'm
[57:07] going to tell you something. It ain't
[57:08] magic water, but it is supernatural. It
[57:11] is lifegiving water this morning.
[57:14] Hallelujah. It's living water. It's
[57:17] restoring water. Amen. It's an eternal
[57:20] source. And when you drink of this
[57:21] water, you will never thirst again.
[57:25] John 4:14 says, "But whosoever
[57:28] drinkkeeth of the water that I shall
[57:30] give him shall never thirst, but the
[57:32] water that I shall give him shall be in
[57:34] him a well of water springing up into
[57:37] everlasting life." Listen, he's the
[57:40] ultimate thirst quencher this morning.
[57:42] He has exactly what you have need of
[57:45] this morning. All the wondering and all
[57:47] the searching and all the running and
[57:49] all the thirsting. Listen, there is a
[57:51] source to quench that this morning.
[57:53] There is a source of life. There is
[57:55] hope. There is peace. And I'm going to
[57:57] tell you where you find it. It's all in
[58:00] Jesus this morning. Everything you have
[58:03] need of. Listen, you don't have to be a
[58:05] nervous wreck this morning. You don't
[58:07] have to be tore up about how things are
[58:09] going or how things are going to go. You
[58:11] don't have to be dependent on all kind
[58:13] of prescriptions just to get through the
[58:15] day.
[58:16] You don't got to have sat find
[58:18] satisfaction in things of the world and
[58:20] and wonder and search who am I and
[58:22] what's my purpose and you don't have to
[58:24] find validation from others.
[58:28] You know this world is thirsty. They're
[58:30] constantly searching for for likes and
[58:33] saying and things like that. You know
[58:34] they check their social media. I got 87
[58:36] likes, brother Matt. I don't care how
[58:39] many likes I got. I'm not I don't need
[58:42] validation from the world. Jesus Christ
[58:45] came and gave his life for me and said
[58:47] you can have eternal life and I he has
[58:50] pleasure in me and joy in me and he
[58:53] loves me. That's all the validation you
[58:55] need this morning. Hallelujah.
[58:59] There is a there is a water that will
[59:01] quench your thirst forever. And the
[59:04] thing is you can come today and drink
[59:06] freely. You don't have to ask me. You
[59:08] don't have to ask brother Matt. You
[59:10] don't got to get permission. Come and
[59:12] drink of the water of life freely this
[59:15] morning. Amen. Revelation 22:17 says,
[59:18] "And the spirit and the bride say, come,
[59:20] and let him that heareth say, come, and
[59:23] let him that is a thirst come. And
[59:25] whosoever will, let him take the water
[59:27] of life freely."
[59:31] Listen, this ain't just for sinners out
[59:33] there. Oh, come and find Jesus. Come and
[59:35] find Jesus. Listen, you know how it is
[59:37] even in the Christian wall. You have ups
[59:39] and downs. You have rounds and rounds.
[59:41] You have trials and tribulations.
[59:43] Listen, if you've been out there and
[59:45] your ship's been tossed to and fro and
[59:47] it seems like you've been beat to death,
[59:49] I'm saying come get another drink this
[59:51] morning. I'm saying anchor down in that
[59:53] source this morning. Amen. Come and
[59:56] drink freely. Don't just come get a
[59:57] little sip. Don't just Well, I took a
[59:59] drink 15 years ago. It says come and
[1:00:02] drink freely. Freely means in copious
[1:00:04] amounts. It means without restraint this
[1:00:07] morning. Drink and drink and drink and
[1:00:10] drink and drink some more until you're
[1:00:13] saturated by this water of life. Amen.
[1:00:16] In copious
[1:00:18] amounts. Hallelujah. But man is always
[1:00:21] searching in the wrong places. Always
[1:00:23] putting their faith in the wrong things
[1:00:25] and and they're thirsting and they're
[1:00:27] hungering. And yet they refuse to look
[1:00:29] to the word of God as a source.
[1:00:32] They refuse to to search. They'll search
[1:00:34] everywhere else, but they won't search
[1:00:36] through these pages.
[1:00:38] Prophet of God says men are trying to
[1:00:39] find that through the resource of
[1:00:41] literature or culture or education or
[1:00:44] science. What makes them look for
[1:00:47] that? It's because that is exists
[1:00:49] somewhere. That's the reason they hunger
[1:00:52] for it. As David said, when the deep
[1:00:54] calleth to the deep, before there can be
[1:00:56] a deep calling, there has to be a deep
[1:00:59] to respond to that call. Amen. But the
[1:01:03] world today has totally rejected God as
[1:01:06] a source.
[1:01:08] They no longer turn to him at all. That
[1:01:10] they quit drawing and looking and and
[1:01:12] the word is never drawn from or even
[1:01:14] consulted.
[1:01:16] You think about our nation. What
[1:01:17] happened to our nation? Well, it was
[1:01:18] founded on this. This was a source that
[1:01:21] they drew. But as this got pushed aside,
[1:01:24] as he got pushed out of our schools and
[1:01:26] pushed out, you know, we were talking
[1:01:27] about the other day colleges, so many of
[1:01:30] them were founded as as religious
[1:01:32] institutions and now they're the hotbed
[1:01:35] of atheist of atheists and liberalism
[1:01:38] and all that nonsense because they quit
[1:01:40] consulting the word of God. They quit
[1:01:43] drawing from the word of God and looking
[1:01:45] to him and so they look to science. They
[1:01:47] look to education. They look to the
[1:01:49] news. And the thing about our world
[1:01:51] today is they look to entertainment.
[1:01:53] I mean, you think about there'll be some
[1:01:55] major disaster or some, you know, major
[1:01:57] issue going on between Russia and the
[1:01:59] world's on the verge of war and they'll
[1:02:00] be inter interviewing a movie star. What
[1:02:03] do you think about? Who cares what they
[1:02:04] think about it?
[1:02:07] People look to entertainment and they
[1:02:09] they look to books and movies and music
[1:02:11] and they draw from that and they draw
[1:02:14] from that and they intake and they
[1:02:16] intake and they intake and they intake.
[1:02:19] and what's it produced? Our world is
[1:02:22] drunk on entertainment. They're drunk on
[1:02:24] Hollywood and music and social media.
[1:02:26] They're drunk on those things because
[1:02:28] it's all they draw from. And what kind
[1:02:30] of world does it produce? It's produced
[1:02:33] complete and total insanity this
[1:02:35] morning. Because that's the source that
[1:02:38] they draw from. But if a man would draw
[1:02:41] this morning from rivers of life, if man
[1:02:44] would draw this morning, begin to
[1:02:45] fellowship once again with God. Hey, if
[1:02:48] that's the shape you're in this morning,
[1:02:49] I'm not saying you're lost. I'm saying
[1:02:51] get back to the rock. Get back to the
[1:02:53] source of life and begin to draw from
[1:02:55] that this morning. Make that your intake
[1:02:58] and it'll change your output.
[1:03:01] Amen. Well, something's wrong with my
[1:03:03] life, brother, and I got temper issues
[1:03:05] and I got this issue and I can't get
[1:03:07] along with people and I'm always blowing
[1:03:08] up. That's your output, but it's a
[1:03:11] direct reflection of your intake.
[1:03:15] I want to I want to change things. Well,
[1:03:16] then change what you're taking in.
[1:03:18] Change the source that you're drawing
[1:03:20] from this morning. Amen.
[1:03:23] But men
[1:03:24] draw. Now, here's the thing I want us to
[1:03:27] get to. Men draw from the source that
[1:03:30] draws them.
[1:03:33] They draw from their source.
[1:03:37] Listen what brother Brown says. He says,
[1:03:38] "But this fellow, where did that pure
[1:03:40] lying, where did that sin come from?
[1:03:44] Where did this fella Cain, that
[1:03:46] murderer, and the the Bible said the
[1:03:48] devil's a murderer. Where did the lie
[1:03:50] come from? He said the devil's the
[1:03:52] father of a lie. He's a liar and the
[1:03:54] father of it. It had to come from some
[1:03:57] resource outside of God.
[1:04:02] So, we have a world of liars, a world of
[1:04:05] violence, and a world of of of
[1:04:07] murderers. Where is that coming
[1:04:09] from? Think about it. Why are people so
[1:04:12] full of hate? Why are people so full of
[1:04:15] violence and so full of murder and all
[1:04:18] that? It's because of the source they
[1:04:20] draw from. But it's also because of the
[1:04:22] source they come from.
[1:04:25] Brother Brown says, "Where did that
[1:04:27] source of all that vile and filth and
[1:04:30] things that Cain had come from God?"
[1:04:33] Question mark. Couldn't be. He
[1:04:35] says, what did he say in John 8:44? Ye
[1:04:39] are of your father the devil and the
[1:04:42] lust of your father you will do. He was
[1:04:45] a murderer from the beginning and abode
[1:04:47] not in the truth because there is no
[1:04:49] truth in him. When he speaketh a lie he
[1:04:51] speaketh of his own for he is a liar and
[1:04:55] the father of it. So the source that
[1:04:58] they continually draw
[1:05:00] from indicates the source that they come
[1:05:05] from.
[1:05:06] Now, let's take that for ourselves this
[1:05:08] morning. Now, understand what I'm
[1:05:10] saying. I'm not saying that somebody out
[1:05:11] in the world doing those things has no
[1:05:13] hope because we know in a moment in that
[1:05:15] presence when that seed gene of God is
[1:05:17] sparked to life, it'll change what draws
[1:05:20] you. You understand what I'm saying? But
[1:05:22] when you're sitting there and that's all
[1:05:24] you think about and that's all you want,
[1:05:26] there's it's time to check up when you
[1:05:28] want the things of the world more than
[1:05:30] you want the things of God. There's a
[1:05:33] real issue there that we got to wake up
[1:05:35] to this morning. Amen. Amen. This it
[1:05:38] shows the source that they come from.
[1:05:40] And and understand something. I'm not
[1:05:42] preaching against getting a good
[1:05:43] education. Not preaching against having
[1:05:46] entertainment. And I'm not preaching
[1:05:47] against keeping up with the news or
[1:05:49] having a good career. But don't allow
[1:05:51] yourself to get to the place that those
[1:05:54] things become your source.
[1:05:56] That those things become where you draw
[1:05:58] from. and and and because what ends up
[1:06:00] happening is they become you allow them
[1:06:03] to get on equal terms with the word of
[1:06:06] God. You you put them on equal terms in
[1:06:09] importance and also in time given.
[1:06:13] What you deem important, you will give
[1:06:15] time to.
[1:06:18] You will make time for what you think is
[1:06:20] important. It's that simple.
[1:06:25] Come on.
[1:06:27] And if we're not careful, what ends up
[1:06:28] happening
[1:06:31] is we begin to feed on things and and
[1:06:33] and I'm getting a little ahead of myself
[1:06:35] and all for a second, but just bear with
[1:06:37] me. And it's not that we would ever say,
[1:06:40] "Well, I I I believe Hollywood's
[1:06:43] version." But even if you're constantly
[1:06:46] feeding, I'll just say clean
[1:06:47] entertainment, but that's your source.
[1:06:49] That's your source. That's your source.
[1:06:51] It begins to shift your opinion of what
[1:06:54] normal is.
[1:06:58] And I and I ask you I if all you knew if
[1:07:01] all you knew was this,
[1:07:04] if it's all you knew and all you knew
[1:07:07] was the people around
[1:07:09] you, what would you view as normal?
[1:07:12] What what would you view as normal as
[1:07:14] far as dating and marriage and divorce?
[1:07:18] What would you view as normal in the way
[1:07:20] people should dress?
[1:07:23] But when we constantly draw from this
[1:07:25] source, it begins to alter. We still
[1:07:27] feel very strongly the word is right.
[1:07:29] The word is right. But we begin to get
[1:07:31] altered on what we feel is okay, what's
[1:07:35] normal. Because all you you watch is
[1:07:36] this show and and this woman and you
[1:07:38] know and she's married, but this doctor,
[1:07:40] he's so dreamy. Man, you end up sitting
[1:07:42] there watching, man. I hope she ends up
[1:07:44] with him. Wait, you hope what?
[1:07:47] You're watching a show hoping for a
[1:07:49] divorce and hoping for all this kind of
[1:07:51] think about where your mind goes and how
[1:07:53] you look at things because of the source
[1:07:56] you draw from.
[1:07:58] This has to be our source. This has to
[1:08:01] shape our worldview. This if you know we
[1:08:04] get so many people, well that's just
[1:08:06] oldfashioned. No, that's the Bible and
[1:08:09] the Bible is eternal. It's forever and
[1:08:12] ever and ever and it's to be our source
[1:08:14] this morning.
[1:08:18] But you get to the place to where you
[1:08:19] feed on those things enough and your
[1:08:22] spirit begins to crave it.
[1:08:25] To where your spirit feeds more on that
[1:08:27] and it begins to acquire a taste for
[1:08:29] those waters.
[1:08:31] You know, I don't even know why I'm
[1:08:32] going this way, but I remember and back
[1:08:35] in the day when I lived out in the world
[1:08:36] and did things I shouldn't have done.
[1:08:38] And you would hear things like people
[1:08:40] say, you know, somebody somebody might
[1:08:42] say, "Well, you know, beer tastes
[1:08:43] nasty." And somebody said, "Well, it's
[1:08:45] an acquired taste." You got to drink it
[1:08:47] until you can tolerate it. Listen, I
[1:08:50] mean, I I know everybody's different. I
[1:08:52] But there ain't never been anybody ever
[1:08:53] took a drink of a beer and went, "That
[1:08:55] was
[1:08:56] good." They make themselves like it.
[1:09:01] It's an acquired taste. What? What are
[1:09:03] you saying? That first time you tell a
[1:09:05] lie, it's hard to do.
[1:09:08] That first time you watch something you
[1:09:10] know you weren't supposed to, you feel
[1:09:11] guilty about it. But over time, you
[1:09:14] acquire a taste for those things. That
[1:09:17] first time you read that book you
[1:09:18] shouldn't read and you're like,
[1:09:21] but then later you're reading it with no
[1:09:22] no conscience
[1:09:25] because you've acquired a taste for the
[1:09:28] wrong source.
[1:09:31] But if you were in this and this was
[1:09:33] your source, it wouldn't allow you to
[1:09:35] feed on those things. It wouldn't allow
[1:09:37] you to draw. And it's shifting your
[1:09:40] whole mindset and you don't even realize
[1:09:42] it.
[1:09:44] and you're acquiring a taste for
[1:09:47] inappropriate things and your spirit
[1:09:49] feeds on it and you quench the desire
[1:09:51] for the things of God and you replace it
[1:09:53] with a desire for entertainment or a
[1:09:55] desire for knowledge and you begin to
[1:09:58] get satisfaction from polluted waters.
[1:10:02] Listen, God's children don't have to
[1:10:03] drink polluted waters. You've been set
[1:10:06] free from those things. You can have the
[1:10:07] pure unadulterated
[1:10:09] uh word of God and the life that comes
[1:10:11] with it. Listen, I listen, I'm not
[1:10:13] bragging, but I lived a life I'm not
[1:10:15] proud of. I've been places I've not been
[1:10:16] proud of. I've been in stadiums full of
[1:10:19] hundreds of thousands of people doing
[1:10:20] things I wasn't proud of. And I want to
[1:10:22] tell you right now, I would not trade a
[1:10:25] moment of what I have now for what I
[1:10:27] left behind. There's nothing to go back
[1:10:29] to. There's nothing that compares. I
[1:10:32] hear young people, I just want to
[1:10:33] experience this or experience. Listen to
[1:10:35] me. There's nothing worth experiencing
[1:10:37] out there. the things that the the the
[1:10:39] the spirit and the presence and the
[1:10:41] atmosphere you feel when God moves
[1:10:43] through a congregation like this.
[1:10:45] There's nothing they got that comes
[1:10:46] close to it or compares to it. This is
[1:10:50] life.
[1:10:52] Oh my. This is real life. Drink from
[1:10:55] this source this morning. Yes, sir.
[1:10:59] Hallelujah. This world is full of gods
[1:11:02] and they beckon you to worship.
[1:11:05] movements calling you to support their
[1:11:08] cause. World's full of idols and full of
[1:11:11] ideas and full of sources for you to
[1:11:13] draw
[1:11:14] from. But what about water from the
[1:11:17] rock? What about the truth this morning?
[1:11:21] 1 Corinthians 8:55 says, "For though
[1:11:23] there be that are called gods, whether
[1:11:27] in heaven or in earth, as there be God's
[1:11:29] many and Lord's many, but to us there is
[1:11:32] but one God, the Father of whom are all
[1:11:35] things, and we in him, and one Lord
[1:11:38] Jesus Christ, by whom are all things,
[1:11:41] and we by him." Prophet of God says he's
[1:11:44] the same El Shai
[1:11:46] tonight. He changes not. and his
[1:11:49] covenant people has the same privilege
[1:11:51] to draw from the same source that father
[1:11:53] Abraham had to draw. Cuz God swore by
[1:11:56] the same covenant that he'd give us the
[1:11:58] promise. Hallelujah. El Shadai, the
[1:12:01] bosom, the breasted God. If you need
[1:12:03] salvation for your weak soul, draw from
[1:12:05] his side. If you need healing from your
[1:12:07] body, draw from his side. For my
[1:12:09] covenant was with Christ, my son, and in
[1:12:12] there he was wounded for your
[1:12:13] transgressions, and by his stripes you
[1:12:15] were healed. I am the Almighty. just
[1:12:17] lean up there and go to drawing from
[1:12:20] them promises. Amen. I say what a source
[1:12:23] we have this morning. What an unfailing
[1:12:25] source, a pure source. Something that'll
[1:12:27] quench all the desires this morning and
[1:12:29] seal you to the day of your redemption.
[1:12:33] Amen. And it's where you have to anchor
[1:12:36] everything. Well, what what about my
[1:12:38] job? Anchor it in the source.
[1:12:41] Well, what about my friends? Anchor it
[1:12:42] in the source. All your relationships
[1:12:44] better be anchored in the source. That's
[1:12:46] right. You want a good marriage, anchor
[1:12:48] it in that source. You want blessings to
[1:12:50] follow your family, anchor it in that
[1:12:52] source. You need healing today,
[1:12:54] salvation today, anchor it in that
[1:12:56] source this morning. It's an eternal
[1:12:58] source. And it's an unseen source to the
[1:13:00] world. It's an unseen source. Amen. He
[1:13:04] says, "A little while and the world
[1:13:05] seeth me no more, but ye see me." Amen.
[1:13:10] You don't got to go searching all over
[1:13:11] for it. It's here this morning. He's in
[1:13:14] the building this morning. you don't got
[1:13:15] to go try this and try that. You know, I
[1:13:17] think of Daniel. I think of Daniel there
[1:13:19] when he told the the the king's sermon,
[1:13:21] he said, "I don't have to eat those
[1:13:22] things." He said, "I'll I'll just eat
[1:13:25] this." And I think about people in the
[1:13:26] world sometimes and they and they say
[1:13:28] things like, "Well, your kids need to
[1:13:29] experience that and your kids are so
[1:13:31] sheltered and and what you mean y'all
[1:13:33] don't do this and y'all don't do that."
[1:13:35] And Daniel said, "Just watch us for a
[1:13:37] bit." Yeah. And then compare us to them.
[1:13:41] I'd like to say that today. Look at
[1:13:43] those young people and all that they're
[1:13:45] getting to experience. Look at our young
[1:13:48] people and compare the two. Just compare
[1:13:51] us. And they say, "Well, how are they
[1:13:53] living so right? How are they doing
[1:13:54] this? How do you Because they're feeding
[1:13:56] on a different diet than the king's meat
[1:13:59] out there. They're feeding from the King
[1:14:01] of Kings and the Lord of Lords. And
[1:14:04] their source is an everlasting source
[1:14:06] this morning."
[1:14:09] Hallelujah. Amen. And he is where the
[1:14:11] peace is for your troubled soul.
[1:14:14] Amen. He is here with joy for your
[1:14:16] depressed spirit. He is here to
[1:14:18] stabilize your ship that's been rocking.
[1:14:21] Brother Brandham says when the Greek
[1:14:23] woman when she heard of Jesus, faith
[1:14:25] cometh by hearing. Now she was a Greek,
[1:14:27] a heathen. So she heard and she come. He
[1:14:30] says, you know what? Faith finds a
[1:14:32] source that others don't see. Faith
[1:14:34] finds a source that others can't see.
[1:14:38] But blessed are your eyes this morning.
[1:14:42] Amen. You know, there's a lot of people
[1:14:43] who stand for a lot of things. There's a
[1:14:46] lot of people in Washington and all over
[1:14:48] the country stand for things. Yeah. They
[1:14:51] have a backbone and they stand for a lot
[1:14:53] of things, but they anchor in the wrong
[1:14:55] places.
[1:14:57] They anchor in things that'll fail them
[1:14:58] over time. Their faith is in men.
[1:15:01] Listen, I'm going to tell you right now,
[1:15:02] if your faith's in a man, you're going
[1:15:03] to get disappointed. Amen. Amen. They
[1:15:06] put their faith in governments. If your
[1:15:08] faith in a government, you really going
[1:15:09] to get disappointed, right? Amen. They
[1:15:12] put their faith in in churches or in a
[1:15:14] religion. Listen, our faith is not in a
[1:15:16] man. Our faith is not in a church. Our
[1:15:18] faith is not in a religion. Our faith is
[1:15:20] in Jesus Christ alone. He is the source
[1:15:24] of it all this morning. Amen. Brother
[1:15:26] Brandham says over and over again, you
[1:15:28] can look it up for yourself. Faith finds
[1:15:30] its source. He says that over and over.
[1:15:32] Faith finds its source. So what is it?
[1:15:36] means when your faith
[1:15:38] anchors in the very source that your
[1:15:41] faith came from. Faith finds its source.
[1:15:47] In other words, listen, Paul didn't say
[1:15:49] that you have faith in the son of God.
[1:15:52] He said it's the faith of
[1:15:56] that's the source of your faith this
[1:15:58] morning. That's where it came from. So
[1:16:01] when faith finds its source, that's when
[1:16:03] it can really anchor down. Amen. It's
[1:16:06] not just faith in his word. It's the
[1:16:08] faith of the son of God. Amen. Think
[1:16:11] about it. Our faith anchors in him
[1:16:13] because our faith is of him. That's
[1:16:15] where our faith comes from this morning.
[1:16:18] So that's why it may seem ridiculous to
[1:16:20] the world. It may seem ridiculous to
[1:16:22] those around you, but I'm going to do
[1:16:24] what the source says to do. That's where
[1:16:27] it all comes from. I'm going to trust
[1:16:29] the source. The source this morning says
[1:16:31] you're healed. The source this morning
[1:16:33] says you're delivered. The source this
[1:16:35] morning says that you're saved, that
[1:16:37] you're set free, that you can have the
[1:16:39] Holy Ghost. The source says there will
[1:16:41] be a rapture. The source says there will
[1:16:43] be a body change. And I'm not going to
[1:16:44] look here and look there. I'm going to
[1:16:47] trust the source. My faith is anchored
[1:16:49] in the source from which it came.
[1:16:51] Hallelujah.
[1:16:54] Glory. It's time to take our questions
[1:16:56] to the source this morning.
[1:16:59] It's time to take your fears to the
[1:17:01] source. That's right. Listen, that's why
[1:17:03] we got to keep this pure,
[1:17:06] right? That's why we got to keep it
[1:17:08] pure. That's why we got to preach it
[1:17:10] exactly how the Bible teaches it because
[1:17:13] it's not going to produce the same
[1:17:15] results if we take from and add to if we
[1:17:20] slant it just a little or slant it this
[1:17:23] way. Because then instead of life, it'll
[1:17:25] produce death. Right? You can take a
[1:17:28] pool of the freshest, cleanest,
[1:17:30] life-giving water and put a little bit
[1:17:32] of poison in it and it still may look
[1:17:34] good and it still may well boy, you're
[1:17:36] so thirsty, but now there's death in the
[1:17:38] pot.
[1:17:40] And it's not just from the pull pit. In
[1:17:42] your daily life as you look into the
[1:17:44] mirror of the word, you can't take what
[1:17:46] you want and throw away what you don't
[1:17:49] want.
[1:17:52] You got to do what what what the word
[1:17:53] says do. I mean, you think of Rahab. The
[1:17:56] message came and said, "Do this. Put
[1:17:58] this cord out your window. Scarlet
[1:17:59] cord." What if she'd have been like,
[1:18:00] "Well, you know, that really don't match
[1:18:02] my drapes, Brother Matt.
[1:18:04] So, I'm going to use this blue one."
[1:18:08] And you know what? The kind of looks
[1:18:10] tacky hanging out my window. I'mma put
[1:18:12] it over in the should have been dead
[1:18:14] like everybody else. But we take the
[1:18:17] message and go, "Well, you know, it
[1:18:18] don't really matter." And he said that
[1:18:19] in 19, you know, 62. This is 2025. and
[1:18:22] that don't even match up with the
[1:18:23] lifestyle that I live and and you know
[1:18:25] really it's going to look weird if they
[1:18:26] act like that and that man that just
[1:18:28] seems weird. No, it seems weird to you
[1:18:30] because your source has been twisted and
[1:18:32] you're drawing from the wrong place. But
[1:18:34] if you're feeding on the word of God and
[1:18:36] you're drawing from the message of the
[1:18:37] hour, you say, "Lord, I will do what
[1:18:40] thou has commanded me to do. I will
[1:18:42] humble myself to the word of God and I
[1:18:44] will draw from the source of eternal
[1:18:46] life this morning." Hallelujah.
[1:18:51] Amen. And it must be the same word, the
[1:18:53] same Jesus. Jesus Christ the same
[1:18:55] yesterday, today, and forever. We can't
[1:18:58] water it down. We can't change it up,
[1:19:00] mix it up, and we can't let it become
[1:19:02] stagnant and formal neither. There's
[1:19:05] life in this word. There's life in this
[1:19:07] water. Jeremiah 2:13 says, "For my
[1:19:11] people have committed two
[1:19:12] evils, for they have forsaken me, the
[1:19:15] fountain of living waters, and they have
[1:19:17] hewed
[1:19:20] outnists." Prophet God says it don't
[1:19:22] seem even sensible to be right. But
[1:19:25] that's just exactly what the people has
[1:19:27] done. They've left the word, the true
[1:19:30] fountain of God's source and power, to
[1:19:33] drink out of sistns and to make
[1:19:35] themselves sistns. Same as they did
[1:19:37] then, they have done it
[1:19:40] now. We can't tamper with it, church.
[1:19:44] Can't sprinkle it. You I heard it said
[1:19:46] like this today. I thought it was real
[1:19:47] good. And I'll just I'll just direct it
[1:19:50] towards us ministers. Ministers aren't
[1:19:53] cooks. We're supposed to be waiters.
[1:19:56] In other words, however it come out the
[1:19:58] kitchen, I'm supposed to deliver it just
[1:20:01] like that to the table. I don't need it
[1:20:04] back there going, "Man, these folks
[1:20:05] don't know nothing about seasoning. Let
[1:20:07] me put a little Tony's in it. Let me put
[1:20:09] some Louisiana hot sauce." That ain't
[1:20:10] what the chef had in mind. When the chef
[1:20:13] mixed it all up, he knew exactly how it
[1:20:14] was supposed to taste. He knew exactly
[1:20:16] what he wanted before the foundation of
[1:20:18] the world. He said, "This is my word.
[1:20:21] This is the plan. Now, just give it to
[1:20:23] my people. Just break the bread and hand
[1:20:25] it out." And we in turn got to take it
[1:20:27] and eat it just the way he served it. We
[1:20:30] don't need to season it with our
[1:20:31] thinking or mama's ideas or daddy's
[1:20:33] ideas or my old pastor thought this. I
[1:20:35] ain't worried about none of that. What
[1:20:37] does the source say this morning? Just
[1:20:40] take it and feed on the eternal word of
[1:20:42] Jesus Christ.
[1:20:45] Hallelujah. Come and drink from the
[1:20:47] water of life this morning.
[1:20:51] Same word, same Holy Ghost. Amen. Same
[1:20:55] healing, same deliverances. Amen. Jesus
[1:20:57] Christ the
[1:20:59] same. The Bible tells us in John chapter
[1:21:02] 15, he says, "I am the
[1:21:04] vine. Ye are the branches."
[1:21:08] So the branch's source of energy is the
[1:21:11] vine.
[1:21:13] Amen. The vine energizes the branch and
[1:21:17] with the energy of that life, the branch
[1:21:20] then brings forth the fruits.
[1:21:23] So when you look at the fruits being
[1:21:25] produced in your
[1:21:27] life, your relationships, your life,
[1:21:30] where you're at, and you say they don't
[1:21:32] really add up, you maybe you can look
[1:21:34] around and see other Christians and not
[1:21:36] that we can compare ourselves to each
[1:21:38] other, but you can see, wow, that that's
[1:21:40] a real Christian, and I see those
[1:21:41] fruits. And the word says you're
[1:21:43] supposed to have those fruits and
[1:21:44] tenderness and kindness and joy and and
[1:21:47] I don't have any of that. Well, I'm not
[1:21:49] here to condemn. I'm just here to say
[1:21:52] look to see what your energy source is.
[1:21:55] What are you drawing from? Because if
[1:21:56] you're the branch and you're connected
[1:21:58] to the vine, the only fruit you can
[1:22:00] produce is the life of the vine.
[1:22:04] That that's why we have to be prod
[1:22:06] producing the the fruits of the spirit.
[1:22:08] Amen. Whatever source you're drawing
[1:22:10] from, that's the fruit that you're going
[1:22:12] to
[1:22:13] bear. Amen. That that's why the works
[1:22:16] that I do shall you do also. That's why
[1:22:19] these signs shall follow them that
[1:22:21] believe. It's not that we're doing it.
[1:22:23] It's all coming from the source. Amen.
[1:22:25] It's Christ in his church energizing her
[1:22:28] to do the same works that he did.
[1:22:31] Because if we're drawing from the same
[1:22:32] source that they were drawing from in
[1:22:34] the book of Acts, it's going to produce
[1:22:36] the exact same things because we're
[1:22:38] drawing from the same source. A church
[1:22:40] drawing from that source is going to see
[1:22:42] people born again. Brother Matt. Amen. A
[1:22:44] church drawn from that source is going
[1:22:46] to have people that are living
[1:22:47] overcoming lives. A church drawn from
[1:22:50] that source is going to have signs and
[1:22:52] wonders and miracles. We can't claim to
[1:22:54] be the branch and and the life of Christ
[1:22:57] is not being manifested within us. And
[1:23:00] all I'm saying is today as individuals,
[1:23:02] let's check the connection. Let's just
[1:23:04] make sure our major source is drawing
[1:23:07] from the vine. that our branch can
[1:23:09] produce the life of Jesus Christ to a
[1:23:11] dying world and say, "Look, this is the
[1:23:14] life of the Holy Ghost right here. It's
[1:23:17] an overcoming life. It's a life of joy.
[1:23:20] It's a life of kindness. It's a life of
[1:23:22] living for others.
[1:23:25] Listen, a lot of times we talk about
[1:23:26] manifesting Jesus and we get hung up on
[1:23:28] the signs, wonders, and miracles, which
[1:23:29] I'm all about. Well, you can have all
[1:23:32] the signs, wonders, and miracles you
[1:23:33] want and be mean as a snake and treat
[1:23:35] people wrong and something ain't in
[1:23:36] order, right?
[1:23:40] We say we produce the life of Jesus and
[1:23:42] we're talking about opening the eyes of
[1:23:44] the blind. Yes. But what about kindness?
[1:23:47] What about forgiveness? What about
[1:23:49] forgive them, father? They know not what
[1:23:51] they do. Oh, well that was just Jesus.
[1:23:54] Nope. I can read in the book of Acts
[1:23:55] where Steven's getting stoned. He said
[1:23:56] the exact same thing because he's a
[1:23:59] branch drawn from the vine. Amen.
[1:24:04] If we aren't producing that fruit, then
[1:24:06] what source are we drawing from? What
[1:24:09] have we settled for? Let's not just be
[1:24:12] satisfied this morning with religion.
[1:24:15] Let's don't just be satisfied with a a
[1:24:17] good group, a good pastor, and a good
[1:24:18] church. You have all that, but that
[1:24:20] shouldn't satisfy you. That should just
[1:24:22] be the the the place you come and to put
[1:24:25] your licks of fire together to create an
[1:24:27] atmosphere to draw from that source and
[1:24:28] help one another. But you got to be
[1:24:30] drawing on Monday, drawing on Tuesday,
[1:24:32] drawing on Thursday, drawing on Friday,
[1:24:34] drawing on Saturday. If you just come
[1:24:36] here to get a drink, you're going to
[1:24:38] die. You're going to be dehydrated. It's
[1:24:41] time to take another drink. And I don't
[1:24:44] just mean a one-time drink, but a
[1:24:46] continual fellowship with Jesus Christ,
[1:24:48] the source of life this morning. Hey,
[1:24:51] man. We can't just be satisfied with
[1:24:53] coming out. Brother Aaron, I came out of
[1:24:54] the world. Thank God.
[1:24:57] But Jericho has fallen. The seals are
[1:24:59] open. That means the land is available
[1:25:02] to you. We didn't just come out of
[1:25:04] Egypt, but now let's go into the land
[1:25:06] and take everything. It's the land of
[1:25:08] the Holy Ghost. Take what you need this
[1:25:10] morning. Drink from the source of life
[1:25:13] this morning. Possess what God has for
[1:25:15] you. Hey man, let that living water
[1:25:17] saturate your life. Let it saturate your
[1:25:20] marriage. Let it saturate your
[1:25:22] relationship with your children and
[1:25:23] those around you. Let that water
[1:25:26] saturate in this church.
[1:25:28] Let us draw and draw and draw and draw
[1:25:31] from that source. Amen. I say it all the
[1:25:34] time when people say, "Well, you know, I
[1:25:37] I got filled 15 years ago or I got
[1:25:39] filled at camp and I I don't doubt
[1:25:41] people's testimony. I I choose to give
[1:25:43] people the benefit of the doubt."
[1:25:46] But to me, one of the biggest signs that
[1:25:48] you've experienced it is that you want
[1:25:50] more.
[1:25:52] One of the biggest confirmations that
[1:25:54] you met God is that you can't get
[1:25:55] enough. that it's not just a one and
[1:25:58] done for you, but now you've tasted and
[1:25:59] I got to have more of that water. That's
[1:26:01] good water. And you seek and you seek
[1:26:03] and you go more after more and you draw
[1:26:05] and you drink and you draw and you drink
[1:26:07] to where it's overflowing.
[1:26:09] Amen. To where you fall in love with
[1:26:12] Jesus. It is a relationship. Yes, sir. I
[1:26:16] just want you to think about that from
[1:26:17] the standpoint of what a relationship
[1:26:19] is. Can you imagine being in a serious
[1:26:23] relationship, engaged to be
[1:26:28] married, and you talk to your
[1:26:31] significant other once a
[1:26:35] week? Once a week, twice a week if you
[1:26:38] make it on
[1:26:41] Wednesdays. Think about it. Is that a
[1:26:44] healthy
[1:26:47] relationship? Quiet, man. Come on. And
[1:26:50] it's okay. I get it. Little moment of
[1:26:54] self-reflection. Some of y'all are like,
[1:26:56] "Well, that's how often me and my wife
[1:26:57] talk."
[1:26:59] Well, I just I didn't know if you knew
[1:27:01] that's not a healthy relationship. I'm
[1:27:02] just just going to let you
[1:27:06] know. You might can make do. You might
[1:27:09] can get by. But this relationship is
[1:27:12] supposed to be full of joy, full of
[1:27:14] love, full of him speaking and you
[1:27:16] speaking back. You know, it's not just a
[1:27:17] one way. It's just not, you know, we met
[1:27:19] God an Aaron boy. God, go do this. God,
[1:27:21] I need you to do that. God, I need this.
[1:27:22] God, you know, Esther knew how to do it.
[1:27:24] She came before the king and and she
[1:27:26] praised the king and then after she
[1:27:29] praised him and told him how wonderful
[1:27:30] he was and all this, then she said, "I
[1:27:32] have a request." God's not an errand
[1:27:34] boy. We're in a relationship.
[1:27:37] He's our source of life. He's our source
[1:27:39] of hope. He's our everything. Amen. He
[1:27:41] is a neverending supply. If you need
[1:27:44] healing and redemption, Psalms 103:2
[1:27:47] says, "Bless the Lord, oh my soul.
[1:27:49] Forget not all his benefits. Who
[1:27:51] forgiveth all thine iniquities, who
[1:27:52] health all thy diseases, who redeemth
[1:27:55] thy life from destruction, who crowneth
[1:27:57] thee with loving kindness and tender
[1:27:59] mercy, who satisfithth thy mouth with
[1:28:01] good things, so that thy youth is
[1:28:03] renewed like the eagles." If you need
[1:28:06] deliverance, Psalms 34:19 says, "Many
[1:28:08] are the afflictions of the righteous,
[1:28:10] but the Lord deliverth him out of them
[1:28:12] all." If you need salvation, Psalms 37
[1:28:14] says, "But the salvation of the
[1:28:16] righteous is of the Lord. He is their
[1:28:18] strength in the time of trouble." Psalm
[1:28:20] 68 says, "He that is our God is the God
[1:28:23] of salvation." Amen. If you need truth
[1:28:26] this morning, John 14:6, Jesus said unto
[1:28:28] him, "I am the way, I am the truth, and
[1:28:31] I am the life." He's the source of all
[1:28:34] of it this morning.
[1:28:36] Prophet of God says he is the truth.
[1:28:38] There may be other truths, but Jesus is
[1:28:40] that real truth. He is that heavenborn
[1:28:43] truth. God's eternal truth sent to us.
[1:28:45] The only way and the only truth. Other
[1:28:47] things may be true, but Jesus is the
[1:28:50] truth of God. The truth of God's
[1:28:52] salvation. The truth of God's plan is
[1:28:54] Jesus Christ. The way, the truth,
[1:28:57] brother Aaron, I want to know the truth
[1:28:58] this morning. You want to know the
[1:28:59] truth? Consult the word.
[1:29:01] Why? I want to know the truth about
[1:29:03] this. Consult the word. I want to know
[1:29:05] how to live. Consult the word. Well, I
[1:29:07] want to how how are we supposed to
[1:29:08] dress? Consult the word. Well, I want to
[1:29:10] know the truth about hair, consult the
[1:29:12] word. I want to know the truth about
[1:29:13] baptism, consult the word. Well, I want
[1:29:16] to know the truth about the new birth,
[1:29:17] consult the word. We spend so much time
[1:29:20] consulting one another around a kitchen
[1:29:22] table, and we don't never crack a Bible
[1:29:23] open. It's all right there. Just consult
[1:29:27] the source this morning. Get back into
[1:29:30] the word. You I've always said this and
[1:29:33] just just forgive me. I I don't mean it
[1:29:35] ugly, but I'm like, man, if if we can
[1:29:37] sit there and listen to somebody preach
[1:29:38] false doctrine for 15 years, and we
[1:29:41] don't never know it's false doctrine,
[1:29:42] that's our fault,
[1:29:48] you cuz if all you ever drinks tainted
[1:29:50] water, then you don't know it's tainted.
[1:29:53] But there's a source of pure water
[1:29:56] that you can draw from. There's
[1:29:57] there's,00 messages on tape that you can
[1:30:00] draw from. But the problem is we show up
[1:30:02] and wait for the preacher to tell us
[1:30:04] what it says.
[1:30:06] And in that situation, we can be misled.
[1:30:10] We all got to be in the word. We all got
[1:30:14] to be consulting the word. Amen. Drawing
[1:30:16] from the word. Like I said, we've spent
[1:30:18] way too much time consulting other
[1:30:20] sources. We've drawn from man. We've
[1:30:22] drawn from religion. We've drawn from
[1:30:24] our own ideas. We've drawn from mom and
[1:30:26] dad. You the Pharisees did this exact
[1:30:28] same thing.
[1:30:30] They come to Jesus and they tried to
[1:30:31] point back to to mom and dad because of
[1:30:34] how holy and how righteous that they
[1:30:35] thought they were and because they came
[1:30:38] out under a prophet's message. And so
[1:30:40] instead of listening to what the
[1:30:41] manifested word for the day was telling
[1:30:43] them, they said, "Yeah, well our fathers
[1:30:44] ain't mana in the
[1:30:46] wilderness." The manifested word staring
[1:30:48] them in the face. Yeah, but but my dad.
[1:30:52] And Jesus says, "They're all dead.
[1:30:57] They didn't even make it. They didn't
[1:30:59] cross
[1:31:00] over. And you know, brother man, I think
[1:31:03] we've all been guilty. At least I I'll
[1:31:04] just be honest. You know, you done
[1:31:06] learned me. I'll be
[1:31:07] honest. We all I keep I keep saying we
[1:31:10] all I I've been guilty of name dropping
[1:31:14] before. You know, you're talking, you're
[1:31:17] in a little bit, not a debate, but
[1:31:18] discussion with the brother and you say
[1:31:20] and you say something like, "Well, you
[1:31:21] know, me and Brother Tim was talking and
[1:31:24] and brother Tim sees it like that." or
[1:31:27] you know whoever that you have respect
[1:31:29] for sometimes well you know you'll name
[1:31:31] drop just those people know you're not
[1:31:33] making it up you know what I'm saying
[1:31:35] but I get really if you want to know the
[1:31:38] truth we shouldn't have to name drop we
[1:31:40] should be able to say you know the
[1:31:40] scripture says the message of the hour
[1:31:43] in reality but but we all do it
[1:31:45] sometimes but I get tickled at people
[1:31:47] that pick the worst people to bolster
[1:31:50] their
[1:31:51] arguments you know and they're like well
[1:31:53] you know brother so and so and brother
[1:31:56] so doing so they agree with me. Do you
[1:32:00] realize that people agreeing with you is
[1:32:02] no vindication that you're right?
[1:32:04] Lucifer had a third of the angels
[1:32:06] agreeing with him.
[1:32:09] But if you're going to name drop, at
[1:32:10] least pick somebody that bolsters your
[1:32:12] argument. Well, brother so and so,
[1:32:13] brother so and so ain't been here in
[1:32:14] four months.
[1:32:19] Yeah. I don't I'm not interested in the
[1:32:21] opinions of somebody that can't be here
[1:32:23] when the church doors open. I'm not
[1:32:25] interested in the opinions of
[1:32:26] negativity. I'm not interested. Look,
[1:32:28] quit drinking the negativity of broken
[1:32:30] sistns. And let's get back to the source
[1:32:33] of the word of eternal life. What does
[1:32:36] the word say? I got a name drop for you.
[1:32:39] Jesus said Jesus said, "I am the living
[1:32:43] water. He that drinkketh from me shall
[1:32:45] never thirst again." Let's name drop
[1:32:48] Jesus from time to time.
[1:32:52] My goodness. Amen.
[1:32:55] drinking from negativity and people's uh
[1:32:58] opinions. And when and when you tap into
[1:33:00] the eternal source, when you begin to
[1:33:02] drink from El Shai and you begin to get
[1:33:04] your energy from the vine, then when
[1:33:06] problems arise, you march right on
[1:33:08] through as if nothing's wrong. Amen.
[1:33:11] Why? Because you're so full of the
[1:33:12] energy from the vine that you can't
[1:33:15] quit. It's not somebody's opinion. It's
[1:33:17] the energy of Jesus Christ on the inside
[1:33:20] of you pushing something drives you
[1:33:22] forward and drives you over hurts and it
[1:33:25] drives you through trials and man fails
[1:33:27] them and they keep going. Church fails
[1:33:29] them and they keep going. Friends turn
[1:33:31] aside and they keep going. Tragedy hits
[1:33:33] and they keep going. Why? They can't
[1:33:36] quit. There's an eternal source of life
[1:33:38] on the inside and it says forward. Don't
[1:33:41] quit. Don't stop. You're called to make
[1:33:43] it, little children.
[1:33:45] Oh, and that's your source. You won't
[1:33:48] stop short. You go on because you're
[1:33:50] energized by the source of eternal life.
[1:33:54] Yes, sir. I mean, it doesn't matter how
[1:33:55] bad things get. It doesn't matter how
[1:33:58] dry people get spiritually. You don't
[1:34:00] have to because there's a wellspring of
[1:34:03] life. There's a fountain open in the
[1:34:05] house of David.
[1:34:07] I'm not worried how dry things get here
[1:34:09] and how dry things get there and how dry
[1:34:11] the guy next to me is. I don't have to
[1:34:14] dry up this morning. I've tapped into
[1:34:16] the vine.
[1:34:18] Hallelujah. Taking a drink from the
[1:34:20] source this morning. Amen. Yes, sir.
[1:34:24] And since we're a part of
[1:34:27] him, here's where we're going to go to.
[1:34:29] Not just the source where you get
[1:34:31] it, but the source where it comes from.
[1:34:35] Since we're a part of
[1:34:36] him, not only can we draw from that
[1:34:39] source, but we are of that source.
[1:34:44] We're drawn to that life because it's in
[1:34:47] that life that we find our identity.
[1:34:49] Yes, sir.
[1:34:51] It's in him that we find our source.
[1:34:54] It's in him that we find out where we
[1:34:56] come from. And what what what attracts
[1:34:59] us to the
[1:35:00] message? What draws you and yet others
[1:35:03] reject it?
[1:35:06] Think about
[1:35:07] it. What is
[1:35:09] it? And I've said it like this
[1:35:12] before. You can be walking through the
[1:35:14] airport right there in
[1:35:17] Memphis or the mall or wherever you
[1:35:20] shop, whatever. But you're walking
[1:35:22] through the airport and they start
[1:35:24] making
[1:35:25] announcements and they start
[1:35:27] saying, "Bill Smith, is there Bill Smith
[1:35:30] here this morning? Bill Smith, you're
[1:35:32] needed at the counter.
[1:35:34] I ain't paying that no attention.
[1:35:37] Bill
[1:35:38] Smith, you're needed at the counter.
[1:35:40] It's urgent. I don't care how urgent it
[1:35:42] is. I ain't Bill Smith. That has nothing
[1:35:43] to do with me. Please report. It's
[1:35:46] urgent. This is
[1:35:48] important. I got a flight to
[1:35:51] catch. But if I'm walking through there
[1:35:53] and it says Aaron
[1:35:56] Ogles, that's my name.
[1:36:00] Mama, that's me. Yeah. How come that
[1:36:03] message calls out and calls out and
[1:36:05] everybody around you just keeps on
[1:36:06] walking and it calls out and it call
[1:36:09] they keep they don't recognize it don't
[1:36:10] mean nothing to them. Why? It ain't
[1:36:11] calling their name. It ain't calling
[1:36:13] their name but someday you was going
[1:36:15] along and it called your name. It said
[1:36:17] Joe Reynolds and he said here am I Lord
[1:36:21] that called my name. Why can I recognize
[1:36:24] that call? We're from the same source
[1:36:26] this morning. Where' this message come
[1:36:28] from? Thoughts of God. Where'd you come
[1:36:30] from? Thoughts of God. You come from the
[1:36:32] exact same source. So I find strength in
[1:36:35] this word. I find life in this word. I
[1:36:37] find my identity in this word. We're
[1:36:42] from the same source. Amen. That's why
[1:36:45] we identify with it.
[1:36:47] Yes, sir. Hallelujah.
[1:36:50] It's who you are. Quit downing yourself.
[1:36:53] Quit listening to the devil down
[1:36:54] yourself. Down. You're a nobody. You're
[1:36:57] a failure. You're a this. What are you
[1:36:58] talking about? I'm an attribute of
[1:37:00] almighty God. I've been called by
[1:37:03] Almighty God. He called my name. Oh,
[1:37:06] you're not going to make it. I have to
[1:37:07] make it. I can't not make it. I'm a part
[1:37:10] of him. And he's drawing himself back
[1:37:13] into the eternals. And the eternal part
[1:37:15] on the inside of this flesh body is
[1:37:18] being drawn back to eternity because
[1:37:21] why? It is eternal.
[1:37:24] Hallelujah.
[1:37:25] Think about it. It's who you are. Amen.
[1:37:28] If I am she, the bride, and she is him.
[1:37:33] Do the math. I am she and she is him.
[1:37:38] Then I'm every bit as eternal as he is.
[1:37:41] I'm part of the original spoken word
[1:37:44] thoughts of God. I am God made material
[1:37:47] in this day. I am made from the material
[1:37:49] of deity. Don't let that choke you.
[1:37:52] That's the message of the hour. That's
[1:37:54] who you are. Amen. Lift your head up.
[1:37:56] Put your shoulders back. We're not being
[1:37:58] arrogant. We just recognize who we are.
[1:38:01] We're sons and daughters of the most
[1:38:03] high God today. Hallelujah. Amen. Thank
[1:38:07] you, Jesus. Your source in the spiritual
[1:38:11] is just like your source in the natural.
[1:38:13] It determines your DNA.
[1:38:16] Well, no wonder we recognize ourselves
[1:38:18] in the book of Acts. No wonder Malachi 4
[1:38:22] called our name. No wonder we see Mark
[1:38:24] 16 in action. We're from the same
[1:38:27] source. We're from the same material.
[1:38:30] We're eternal. And that's why we were
[1:38:32] seen shouting before the foundation of
[1:38:35] the world.
[1:38:37] Hallelujah. You're eternal. I want that
[1:38:39] to settle for the rest of this service.
[1:38:41] You're eternal. Yes, sir. You cannot be
[1:38:43] destroyed. You are eternal. How about
[1:38:47] you put that in the devil's face this
[1:38:49] morning? He's been beating you and
[1:38:50] beating you and beating you. That's
[1:38:51] okay. Fine. But this is temporary. I'm
[1:38:53] eternal. This trial is temporary. I'm
[1:38:56] eternal. When all this is passed, I'll
[1:38:58] still be here, devil, because you are a
[1:39:00] created being who had a beginning and
[1:39:02] you had an end. But when you've begun, I
[1:39:04] was in the mind of God. And when you
[1:39:06] end, I will be with God in eternity.
[1:39:09] Hallelujah.
[1:39:10] I'm not going to be drugged down by
[1:39:12] these temporary trials and temporary
[1:39:14] hardships. They may be hard, but I'm
[1:39:17] eternal this morning.
[1:39:19] Hallelujah.
[1:39:21] He says in very plain language, the true
[1:39:23] bride of Christ was in the mind of God
[1:39:25] eternally, though not expressed until
[1:39:27] each came forth in the designated
[1:39:30] decreed season. As each each member came
[1:39:33] forth, it became expressed and took its
[1:39:35] place in the body. Thus, this bride is
[1:39:37] the literal spoken word seed bride. Yes,
[1:39:40] sir. And though she is feminine in
[1:39:41] designation, she is also called the body
[1:39:43] of Christ. Right? It is very apparent
[1:39:46] that she ought to be called that. For
[1:39:48] she was predestinated in him, came from
[1:39:51] the same source, was eternal with him,
[1:39:54] and is now manifesting God in a many
[1:39:56] membered body. Whereas once God was
[1:39:57] manifested in one member, even our Lord
[1:40:00] Jesus Christ. Amen.
[1:40:05] This don't mean
[1:40:12] sometimes, brother Tim takes his jacket
[1:40:14] off right when you think he's about to
[1:40:15] close and you go,
[1:40:16] "Oh,
[1:40:18] oh, that's not an O. That's just I'm
[1:40:22] hot." Thank you. Prophet tells us says
[1:40:24] as the eternal logos was manifested in
[1:40:27] the son and in Jesus dwelt all the
[1:40:29] fullness of the godhead bodily and that
[1:40:32] eternal one was the father manifest in
[1:40:34] the flesh. Thereby he gained the title
[1:40:36] of son. Even so we eternal in his
[1:40:39] thoughts in our turn became the many
[1:40:42] membered spoken word seed manifested in
[1:40:45] the flesh. And those eternal thoughts
[1:40:48] now manifest in the flesh y are the sons
[1:40:52] of God even as we are so called
[1:40:57] church. That's why you're homesick for
[1:40:59] it.
[1:41:00] That explains why you can be homesick
[1:41:03] for somewhere you've never been because
[1:41:05] you have been. It's where you came from
[1:41:08] and you've been catching glimpses of it.
[1:41:10] Word comes forth and the spirit moves in
[1:41:12] the place and what is it that moves you
[1:41:14] to rejoicing? What is it? You catch a
[1:41:16] glimpse of home. You catch a glimpse of
[1:41:18] that feeling. You recognize for just a
[1:41:20] moment, even though I'm stuck in this
[1:41:21] flesh, in that atmosphere, this is
[1:41:23] home's atmosphere. This is the place I
[1:41:25] belong. This this is where I'm going to
[1:41:26] live forever. And it begins to call you
[1:41:28] and it begins to beckon you. And you
[1:41:29] can't help but rejoice. Why? The word
[1:41:31] already said you were going to rejoice.
[1:41:33] And all you're doing is manifesting what
[1:41:35] the word of God has already said about
[1:41:37] you. Oh, you've been there, church.
[1:41:40] You're catching glimpses of home this
[1:41:42] morning. There is a land just beyond the
[1:41:44] river. It calls you and it beckons you
[1:41:47] this morning. That's why you can't be
[1:41:49] comfortable here. Others can be okay in
[1:41:51] the nonsense. They can be okay in the
[1:41:53] filth and it just drives you crazy. Why?
[1:41:55] You weren't made for it. This isn't your
[1:41:57] home, but you're ready to leave. You're
[1:41:59] ready to go. It's in your blood. It's in
[1:42:01] your DNA. Amen. Home is calling this
[1:42:04] morning. Yes, sir. Brother P Brown says
[1:42:06] in the only way you can be a son or a
[1:42:08] daughter of God, you had to be a part of
[1:42:10] God. And God isn't complete without you.
[1:42:17] Think about that this morning. I'm just
[1:42:18] I'm just a nobody. I I live up somewhere
[1:42:21] near Paraggo. Is that how you say it?
[1:42:24] Paraggo. I'm from Black Rockck,
[1:42:26] Arkansas. I'm from I'm from Louisiana.
[1:42:29] I'm just God isn't complete without you.
[1:42:34] Amen.
[1:42:37] If you ever let that sink down in your
[1:42:40] soul, he needs me. He loves me. He wants
[1:42:45] me. He desires me. Yes, sir.
[1:42:49] He isn't complete without you. Brother
[1:42:51] Brham says, "That's right. Cuz there is
[1:42:53] one only one resource of eternal life,
[1:42:56] and that is God. And him alone has
[1:42:58] eternal life." Now, you were a part of
[1:43:00] him in so much that you're an attribute
[1:43:02] in in his thinking in the beginning. And
[1:43:04] because he thought of you in the
[1:43:06] beginning, it gives that little tug.
[1:43:09] Yes, sir. Towards him. How many feels
[1:43:11] that little tug this morning? That
[1:43:13] little pull towards home. He says, "And
[1:43:15] if there's only one form of eternal
[1:43:16] life, and that's God's life." Only one
[1:43:18] form of eternal life, and that's God.
[1:43:20] There to be a son of God, you had to be
[1:43:22] in him always. The gene of your life
[1:43:25] tonight was in God the Father before
[1:43:27] there even was a molecule. And you are
[1:43:30] nothing but the manifestation of the
[1:43:33] gene of life that was in God as a son of
[1:43:36] God. Now you're expressed after his word
[1:43:39] has come in you to light up this age.
[1:43:42] Amen. You are expressing God's life.
[1:43:45] Yes, sir. Listen, you're so much more
[1:43:47] than a nobody. And as long as you think
[1:43:49] of yourself as a nobody, as long as you
[1:43:51] have that slave mentality stuck and
[1:43:54] you're used to being defeated and you're
[1:43:55] used to being defeated, you just I just
[1:43:56] have to give up. I just have to give in.
[1:43:58] No, sir. You were put here. The Bible,
[1:44:00] brother Bramble says to light up the
[1:44:02] age. How important is that? Who's going
[1:44:05] to see the light? Who's going to shine
[1:44:07] the light in the darkness? The
[1:44:09] attributes that God put here to light up
[1:44:11] this age. That's what you're called for.
[1:44:13] You're not called to blend in. You're
[1:44:14] not called to fit in at work, fit in at
[1:44:16] school. Will I stand out? Thank God you
[1:44:19] stand out. You're here to light up the
[1:44:21] age. And show there's a God. There's a
[1:44:23] truth. There's a way. There's a life.
[1:44:25] And it's Jesus. Hallelujah. You're
[1:44:29] called to light up the age. What an age
[1:44:31] we're living in. What a message. Yes,
[1:44:34] sir. Think about it. When the mysteries
[1:44:37] of God are finished and now we can see
[1:44:39] clearly. We can see clearly. We can see
[1:44:42] the whole thing from a higher plane
[1:44:44] through the eyes of an eagle. We see the
[1:44:47] view from above. And when we get up
[1:44:50] there, when we get up there, we see the
[1:44:53] whole picture. Yeah. Yeah. You think
[1:44:56] about it.
[1:44:57] down through the ages. Great men, great
[1:45:00] scholars. Luther, Wesley, you can name
[1:45:03] all the uh the great ones down through
[1:45:06] the ages. Spurgeon, great men, godly
[1:45:10] men, but they were seeing
[1:45:13] it from the same
[1:45:15] level. And so even though they studied,
[1:45:18] they might could catch a
[1:45:19] glimpse, there were things in the way.
[1:45:22] There was things hidden.
[1:45:24] You think you drive through Louisiana,
[1:45:27] you can see up here, man. Y'all got open
[1:45:29] fields. And Louisiana, you feel like
[1:45:31] you're driving through a tunnel all the
[1:45:32] time, just trees. There may be beautiful
[1:45:35] stuff right over there. There might be
[1:45:37] farmland. There might be beautiful
[1:45:39] hills. Probably not, but there might
[1:45:41] be. But you don't know it because you're
[1:45:44] on that level. But what happens if you
[1:45:47] can go up high? What happens when you
[1:45:49] can go up like an
[1:45:51] eagle? And we had an eagle coming this
[1:45:54] day. And now we get to see things
[1:45:57] through an eagle's perspective.
[1:45:59] And so we see the whole picture. So
[1:46:02] what's the whole picture? I'm going to
[1:46:04] sum it up real simple.
[1:46:06] You came from God.
[1:46:10] You're going back to God. That's the
[1:46:13] whole picture. You're eternal. What
[1:46:15] about all this in between? and the devil
[1:46:17] got me to fall here and he got me to
[1:46:18] backslide there and he got me to
[1:46:19] struggle here and I failed here and this
[1:46:21] relationship here. You come from God.
[1:46:26] You're going back to God. What the devil
[1:46:28] does in between here is of little
[1:46:30] consequence. The whole picture is you
[1:46:32] are
[1:46:34] eternal. You're eternal. No matter what,
[1:46:36] you're eternal. But I got family
[1:46:38] trouble. Eternal. I've got failures.
[1:46:40] Eternal. I've been battling sickness.
[1:46:42] You're eternal. The eagle came and he
[1:46:44] said, "You came from the thoughts of God
[1:46:46] and you're going back to the thoughts of
[1:46:48] God." There is a source drawing you this
[1:46:51] morning. What's the whole picture? You
[1:46:53] are eternal. You're going back to God.
[1:46:57] Hallelujah.
[1:46:59] Hallelujah. Your failures aren't
[1:47:02] eternal. Your struggles are not eternal.
[1:47:05] Your sickness, your battles,
[1:47:08] Satan says, "Oh, I'm going to ruin your
[1:47:11] life.
[1:47:14] He can't ruin your life. Amen. Like to
[1:47:16] remind him that my life began before
[1:47:19] his.
[1:47:21] And will go on long after his. Think
[1:47:24] about it. You've been there. We're not
[1:47:27] all a bunch of angels. We've got
[1:47:29] failures. I still have them. But Satan
[1:47:32] will zero
[1:47:34] in on a microcosmic portion of your
[1:47:37] existence.
[1:47:40] Think about it. In the realm of
[1:47:42] eternity, now really speaking of time
[1:47:44] and eternity here, but in the realm of
[1:47:47] eternity, he'll zero in on that year of
[1:47:49] your life you didn't serve God.
[1:47:53] Or he'll zero in the few years where you
[1:47:56] didn't have a relationship with your
[1:47:57] children. or he'll zero in on this.
[1:48:01] He'll zero in on this failure and he'll
[1:48:04] replay it in your head over and over and
[1:48:07] over and he'll say, "I ruined your
[1:48:10] life. I ruined your life." Can you
[1:48:14] imagine me walking into New York City,
[1:48:17] walking into the biggest, wealthiest,
[1:48:20] richest bank there is, picking up a
[1:48:23] penny in the lobby and going, "I robbed
[1:48:25] the place.
[1:48:29] I robbed them. I took them for
[1:48:31] everything they're worth.
[1:48:35] That's the portion of their life he
[1:48:36] points to and says, "I ruined your life.
[1:48:39] I've got all eternity to rejoice with my
[1:48:42] loved ones, with Jesus Christ with no
[1:48:44] trials, no troubles, no heartaches, no
[1:48:46] failures. I'll be united with everybody
[1:48:48] I ever lost. Every pain will be wiped
[1:48:50] away." And you want to point to a little
[1:48:52] portion of nothing and say, "You ruin
[1:48:54] me." He can't ruin you. You're eternal.
[1:48:57] You're made of deity. You came from God.
[1:49:00] You're going back to God. He hasn't
[1:49:02] robbed nothing. My God owns the cattle
[1:49:04] on a thousand hills. I'm the son of
[1:49:06] prosperity. I have the Holy Spirit in my
[1:49:09] life. I've got a rapture ahead. No
[1:49:11] matter what he does, he can't ruin you
[1:49:14] today. He has not ruined you today. You
[1:49:17] are an overcomer. You are the bride of
[1:49:19] Christ. You are part of deity. You are
[1:49:22] going to have a body change. That's who
[1:49:24] you are.
[1:49:26] Hallelujah. Amen. I am eternal, sir.
[1:49:32] This world is going to end. Yes, sir.
[1:49:35] All sin's going to end. Systems of man
[1:49:38] are going to end. Religions will end.
[1:49:40] Sickness will end. Heartaches will end.
[1:49:42] Fear will end. But the word,
[1:49:46] it can never end. Heavens and earth
[1:49:49] going to pass away. But my word now when
[1:49:52] you can identify yourself as part of
[1:49:55] that word
[1:49:57] then you get the revelation. Yes sir. I
[1:50:00] can't be destroyed. I'm never going to
[1:50:02] have an end. You can let that crush your
[1:50:05] fears this morning and calm your worries
[1:50:06] this morning and just recognize that
[1:50:09] God's in control. What are you saying,
[1:50:11] brother Aaron? I'm saying you are of
[1:50:13] God, little children. Yes, sir. Prophet
[1:50:16] of God tells us. He says, "You're here
[1:50:18] because your name was placed on the
[1:50:19] Lamb's book of life before there was
[1:50:21] even a foundation of the
[1:50:25] world." I don't know if I ever told this
[1:50:27] here before. I'm going tell it again
[1:50:28] because I like it. You ever heard of a
[1:50:30] time
[1:50:31] stamp to where you can look and see when
[1:50:33] a transaction took
[1:50:35] place? They use it in business. Matter
[1:50:37] of fact, they've even upheld it in the
[1:50:38] court of law. It can be used as
[1:50:40] evidence. We have a time stamp showing
[1:50:43] when this took place. I can just see the
[1:50:46] devil coming up before the throne of
[1:50:47] God. Say, you see, I know you claim that
[1:50:50] Aaron belongs to you, God, but actually
[1:50:52] from the time he was born all the way up
[1:50:56] till some many, many years later when he
[1:50:58] was a grown married man, I actually had
[1:50:59] control over his life. See, he didn't
[1:51:01] give his life to you till he was, you
[1:51:04] know, 30 years old. He actually served
[1:51:07] me, God, longer than he has served you.
[1:51:10] So, he actually belongs to me, you know,
[1:51:12] and God God's gentleman. So he says,
[1:51:14] "Okay, well you let me check the record.
[1:51:16] Let me let's check the time stamp
[1:51:18] because because you're saying you had
[1:51:19] him." And he looks back there and he
[1:51:22] says, "Well, according to the time
[1:51:25] stamp, there was a lamb slain before the
[1:51:28] foundation of the world." And I wrote
[1:51:30] his name on my book before I ever even
[1:51:33] created you. So how could he belong to
[1:51:36] you? He was mine first. I had him first.
[1:51:39] He belonged to me first. I claimed him
[1:51:41] first. He was mine. He will always be
[1:51:44] mine. Just because you attacked, just
[1:51:46] because his failures, because his flesh
[1:51:48] got in the way, that doesn't change the
[1:51:50] fact that the time stamp says before the
[1:51:53] devil ever existed, I was a son of God.
[1:51:55] I was a child of God. I was part of God
[1:51:58] and I'm going back to God today.
[1:52:01] Hallelujah.
[1:52:02] You were in the eternals. You was with
[1:52:06] Jesus when he was here. You've been
[1:52:08] whooping the devil a lot longer than you
[1:52:10] thought you had. And you're going to
[1:52:12] keep whipping him every single day until
[1:52:14] we leave here because that's what Jesus
[1:52:16] did and that's who we are today.
[1:52:18] Hallelujah. You are the word bride. Yes,
[1:52:21] sir. Prophet of God says, "And God knows
[1:52:23] just exactly where you belong and what
[1:52:25] age you belong in." And therefore, if
[1:52:27] you got eternal life, the word eternal
[1:52:30] is something that never did begin, never
[1:52:32] can end. So, whoever you were, see, you
[1:52:35] were, you always were. You were God's
[1:52:38] attribute being displayed. A word in the
[1:52:41] beginning was the word and the word is a
[1:52:43] thought made manifest. You think it then
[1:52:46] speak it. He says like I say light. I
[1:52:48] had to think light before I said light.
[1:52:51] Microphone. I had to say had to think
[1:52:53] microphone to say microphone. He says
[1:52:55] and we are God's attributes his thoughts
[1:52:59] displayed. And I ask you how can we not
[1:53:02] manifest Jesus? How can we not have the
[1:53:05] life of Jesus manifested through us? How
[1:53:08] can we not do his
[1:53:09] works? See, the bride is going to
[1:53:11] manifest
[1:53:12] Jesus just as perfectly as he manifested
[1:53:15] the father.
[1:53:18] This gene. Well, you say, "How am I
[1:53:20] going to do that, brother?" And I No,
[1:53:21] no, no, no. You're not. Right. You're
[1:53:23] going to play a part. But this gene with
[1:53:26] this attribute, with that gene, with
[1:53:29] some attributes in Louisiana and
[1:53:30] attributes in Ohio and attributes in
[1:53:32] Tennessee and all around the world,
[1:53:35] those attributes come together to make
[1:53:38] up the body of the Lord Jesus Christ
[1:53:43] coming together in this day to make up
[1:53:44] his entire body. That's why you can't
[1:53:46] quit. That's why you can't stop. You're
[1:53:48] an attribute. You're of God. You're
[1:53:50] energized by an eternal source. No
[1:53:53] matter how hard it gets, you can't stop.
[1:53:57] And I want to zero in on this right now
[1:53:58] as we bring this to a close because we
[1:54:01] all go through some hard things. I don't
[1:54:03] even pretend to go through things as
[1:54:04] hard as a lot of you. You know,
[1:54:07] sometimes you think you got it bad and
[1:54:09] you look around
[1:54:10] and but we all have our trials. We all
[1:54:14] have
[1:54:16] situations and sometimes this flesh
[1:54:18] wants to stop.
[1:54:20] life gets to beating you down and
[1:54:22] seemingly down to death and trials on
[1:54:25] every hand and sometimes within your
[1:54:27] flesh you begin to wonder why
[1:54:30] you know I I'll just throw this in
[1:54:34] there. Sister Lydia's mom had passed
[1:54:37] away and brother Donnie was speaking at
[1:54:39] the funeral. You know he said we've been
[1:54:41] taught a lot of times that it's wrong to
[1:54:43] ask why. He said that's not true. He
[1:54:47] said, he said, "I our example, Jesus
[1:54:51] Christ, hung on the cross and said,
[1:54:53] "Father,
[1:54:55] why?" There's nothing wrong with a why.
[1:54:58] As long as you're okay sometimes with
[1:55:00] not understanding until you get there.
[1:55:02] Sometimes we we get angry at not having
[1:55:04] the answers, but it's human to ask
[1:55:07] why.
[1:55:09] Why? Why?
[1:55:11] You get worn down and you want to quit.
[1:55:15] The flesh wants to stop. We want
[1:55:17] suffering to end. We want pain to end.
[1:55:19] We want trials to
[1:55:20] end. You don't think Jesus wanted his to
[1:55:24] end? You don't think he wanted it to be
[1:55:26] over? You don't think there was a
[1:55:28] temptation to call all those angels to
[1:55:30] deliver him off the cross? Father, why
[1:55:34] hast thou forsaken me? Think about it.
[1:55:37] He was forsaken. Look it up. He was
[1:55:39] abandoned. Why have you abandoned me? He
[1:55:42] was deserted.
[1:55:44] When they beat him nearly to death, he
[1:55:46] had ribs showing. He had flesh missing.
[1:55:48] Why didn't he
[1:55:50] stop? When it hurt so bad. When his
[1:55:53] friends abandoned him. How many of us
[1:55:55] want to quit? Because our friends
[1:55:56] abandoned
[1:55:57] us. They denied even knowing who he was.
[1:56:00] They hid while he was on trial. They hid
[1:56:02] while he was being beat. Why didn't he
[1:56:04] quit?
[1:56:08] Because the very word that he manifested
[1:56:12] was the source of energy that drove him
[1:56:14] to its fulfillment.
[1:56:17] The very word that he manifested was the
[1:56:19] source of energy driving him because it
[1:56:23] had to be fulfilled.
[1:56:25] So he couldn't quit. He may have wanted
[1:56:28] to. The word drove him. The word drove
[1:56:31] him. He was the source of it. And yet it
[1:56:34] was the source of his strength. He was
[1:56:36] the power of the word and the power of
[1:56:38] the word was in him and inside of him
[1:56:42] was a hidden mystery and that hidden
[1:56:45] mystery was also
[1:56:48] word parts of himself that couldn't be
[1:56:51] expressed until the end
[1:56:53] time and it was word and that word was
[1:56:57] driving him. What word you? It was
[1:57:01] driving him. And those parts on the
[1:57:03] inside of him that could not be
[1:57:05] expressed until the end time could never
[1:57:07] be expressed unless he was put to sleep
[1:57:09] like Adam
[1:57:10] was. And those parts were also word. And
[1:57:13] because of them, he couldn't stop. Well,
[1:57:17] brother, brother, what's that got to do
[1:57:18] with us?
[1:57:20] Because now you can't
[1:57:22] stop. Because you, the parts that were
[1:57:24] once hidden in him are now manifested.
[1:57:26] And there's something hidden on the
[1:57:28] inside of you. That's right.
[1:57:30] And now whereas once he could not stop
[1:57:32] because you had to be manifested,
[1:57:34] there's a bride that cannot stop because
[1:57:37] there's something on the inside of them,
[1:57:38] a hidden mystery and they must manifest
[1:57:41] him. So there was a time he couldn't
[1:57:43] stop because you had to be manifested
[1:57:45] and now we can't stop because Jesus
[1:57:48] Christ has to be manifested to a dying
[1:57:50] world and it drives us. And Jesus said
[1:57:52] the nails are worth it, the weapon's
[1:57:54] worth it, the cross is worth it. And I
[1:57:56] say today his bride saying the trials
[1:57:58] are worth it. The struggle is worth it.
[1:58:00] Everything I'm going through, Lord, it's
[1:58:02] worth it. But I'm going to take another
[1:58:03] step. I'm going to keep going. No matter
[1:58:05] how bad life's getting, no matter who
[1:58:07] leaves, no matter who quits, there's
[1:58:09] something on the inside of me. There's a
[1:58:11] word on the inside of me and it's
[1:58:13] pulling and it's drawing cuz it must be
[1:58:16] manifested. There's a rapture. Who's
[1:58:18] going to go? I want to quit. Can't quit.
[1:58:20] Got to keep going. I'm being drawn to it
[1:58:23] because the word says there's a bride
[1:58:25] and the word's on the inside and the
[1:58:27] word's got to be fulfilled. So, it draws
[1:58:29] and it pulls and it draws. It's my
[1:58:32] source of life this morning. You can't
[1:58:35] quit. Why? Cuz we see the whole picture.
[1:58:38] You came from God. You're going back to
[1:58:41] God. It's Jesus on the inside. It's
[1:58:44] Jesus manifesting his life. It's Jesus
[1:58:46] overcoming in your body today.
[1:58:49] Hallelujah. Amen.
[1:58:51] Hallelujah. It's an eternal word. Oh,
[1:58:55] why does this word draw
[1:58:56] us? Why does it sustain
[1:58:59] us? It's where we find what we need.
[1:59:03] Because it's who we
[1:59:04] are. Prophet tells us, he says, first of
[1:59:07] all, we know most assuredly that the
[1:59:10] purpose of God stands in
[1:59:12] election. It was purposed in himself. It
[1:59:15] was God's purpose to bring forth a
[1:59:17] people like unto himself that would be a
[1:59:20] word bride. She was chosen before the
[1:59:22] foundation of the world in him. She was
[1:59:25] fornown and beloved before she was ever
[1:59:27] brought forth during the ages upon the
[1:59:30] earth. She was redeemed by his blood and
[1:59:33] can
[1:59:34] never grab this this morning as we
[1:59:38] close. Grab this. She was redeemed by
[1:59:40] his blood and can never come into
[1:59:45] condemnation. She can never be in the
[1:59:48] judgment because sin cannot be imputed
[1:59:52] unto her. Why? Because you came from the
[1:59:56] thoughts of
[1:59:57] God. You're going to go back to the
[1:59:59] thoughts of God. The source of the bride
[2:00:02] is an eternal source. You can't be
[2:00:05] destroyed.
[2:00:07] You cannot be annihilated because he
[2:00:08] cannot be annihilated. You're the word
[2:00:11] bride. Hybrids can be destroyed. Sin,
[2:00:15] unbelief, the devil, they can all be
[2:00:17] destroyed. Brother Matt, when all these
[2:00:20] storms is over, y'all still going to be
[2:00:22] here. When everything gets sorted out,
[2:00:25] y'all still going to be standing. And
[2:00:27] when the storm of all storms caused by
[2:00:29] the fall in the Garden of Eden ceases,
[2:00:32] we're still going to be there.
[2:00:34] We can't be destroyed because we're of
[2:00:38] God. Where does this charge we have come
[2:00:41] from? How do we go on and on and on?
[2:00:45] Where does the source of our strength
[2:00:46] come from? It's a divine energy. It's an
[2:00:50] eternal
[2:00:51] source. You can say this morning when
[2:00:53] you leave here, I came from
[2:00:57] God and I'm going back to God. Can you
[2:01:00] bow your heads with me this morning?
[2:01:05] You know, the devil comes in so many
[2:01:07] different attacks, so many different
[2:01:10] ways. Sometimes we find ourselves
[2:01:13] drinking from the wrong
[2:01:17] source. We find ourselves drawn by the
[2:01:19] wrong
[2:01:21] things. I sure wasn't condemning you
[2:01:23] this morning. I'm just saying, let's get
[2:01:24] back to the source. It's open in the
[2:01:26] house of David. It's available for you.
[2:01:29] But really, I just want you to stop and
[2:01:31] think for a minute.
[2:01:33] Recognizing all your failures. Ain't
[2:01:35] nothing wrong with recognizing you got
[2:01:37] them. I got them. I get knocked down. I
[2:01:40] get beat up. But in all those
[2:01:43] failures, I just want to encourage you
[2:01:45] and tell you this morning, you're not
[2:01:47] going to miss
[2:01:48] it. You're not going to miss
[2:01:51] it because you can't. Because you're
[2:01:54] part of God. What is the source of the
[2:01:59] bride? the thoughts of God. It's who we
[2:02:02] are. It's where we draw our strength.
[2:02:04] It's where we come from. It's where
[2:02:05] we're going. I just wonder if there'll
[2:02:07] be somebody in here like like myself
[2:02:09] today that would say, "Lord, let that
[2:02:11] revelation strike my heart today. That
[2:02:13] in every struggle, I just take another
[2:02:14] step. In every battle, I take another
[2:02:17] step because I know it's not in my
[2:02:18] strength, but Lord, it's you drawing me.
[2:02:20] Lord, forgive me if I've been drawing
[2:02:22] from the wrong source. Forgive me if
[2:02:23] I've been looking in the wrong source.
[2:02:25] But today, Lord, I want to take another
[2:02:27] drink from you. I want to draw from you
[2:02:29] this morning, Lord. Father, Lord, we
[2:02:31] come to you with hands lifted, our
[2:02:32] hearts open, saying, "Lord, I pray you
[2:02:34] forgive us for ever doubting. Forgive us
[2:02:36] for worrying. Lord, forgive us, Lord,
[2:02:38] when you've come so plainly in this day
[2:02:40] in a message and you showed us who we
[2:02:42] are. Lord, you showed us where we come
[2:02:44] from. You showed us where we're going,
[2:02:46] Lord. You've pulled back the seals and
[2:02:47] you said, "You are of God, little
[2:02:49] children." Lord, today, may we take
[2:02:51] faith in that. May we take faith
[2:02:53] knowing, Lord, that you're on the scene
[2:02:55] for us, that you're fighting our
[2:02:56] battles, Lord, the devil has not ruined
[2:02:58] us. It doesn't matter what he's done,
[2:03:00] where we failed, where we've struggled,
[2:03:01] he can't ruin us, for we are eternal.
[2:03:04] Lord, thank you for that this morning.
[2:03:05] Thank you that you didn't stop on your
[2:03:07] way to Calvary. Thank you that you shed
[2:03:09] your blood for me. Thank you that you
[2:03:10] opened my prison, Lord. Thank you that
[2:03:13] you opened my eyes, Father. Thank you
[2:03:15] for loving me this morning, Jesus. Lord,
[2:03:17] I just want to lay aside all the other
[2:03:19] sources right now. I want to lay aside
[2:03:21] my doubt and my fear. I want to lay
[2:03:23] aside where I've been drawing. Lord, I
[2:03:25] just want to come to you and say, "Lord,
[2:03:26] I need a drink. Lord, I need more of
[2:03:29] you. I need more revelation. I need
[2:03:30] more. Lord, just pour yourself into me.
[2:03:33] Lord, may I never be satisfied with
[2:03:34] where I'm at, but Lord, I want to take
[2:03:36] another step and another step and
[2:03:38] another step, Lord, until I step into
[2:03:40] that body change. Lord, I thank you for
[2:03:42] a message that showed us who we are. I
[2:03:44] thank you that you revealed it to us.
[2:03:46] Lord, I commit these people, Lord, this
[2:03:48] congregation and all the Lord folks and
[2:03:50] the believers in this area dealing with
[2:03:51] these storms. Lord, I pray your hand
[2:03:53] will move. Lord, may you just stay the
[2:03:55] rain and stay the water, Lord. Lord, may
[2:03:57] the may the lost be nothing that's not
[2:03:59] recovered, Lord. May you just bless them
[2:04:00] and restore twofold. I pray, Father.
[2:04:03] Lord, may they have more after than they
[2:04:05] did before. May you work in a mighty
[2:04:07] way, Lord, on every heart, those that
[2:04:09] are sick, those in the hospital, Lord,
[2:04:11] those that facing operations, Lord.
[2:04:13] Lord, you see, even at home, we have a
[2:04:15] funeral to go do, Lord. May your hand of
[2:04:17] mercy, Lord, be upon all these lives.
[2:04:20] And may we not get caught up staring at
[2:04:22] the trees today, but may we be elevated
[2:04:24] with an eagle's you to see the whole
[2:04:25] picture. We may have hardships this week
[2:04:28] that we never saw coming next week that
[2:04:30] we can't even explain. But Lord, may we
[2:04:33] not lose the vision, Lord, that you sent
[2:04:36] to us in this day. And you told us
[2:04:38] you're going to make it because you was
[2:04:40] with me before the foundation of the
[2:04:41] world and you'll be with me after its
[2:04:43] end. We thank you, Father. We commit
[2:04:45] this time, this service. I pray you take
[2:04:47] these words, Lord. May they will in some
[2:04:50] way Lord be a blessing and a help to
[2:04:52] your people. In Jesus name we pray.
[2:04:55] Commit it all to you.
[2:04:57] [Music]
[2:05:08] Amen. Amen. You'll stand to your feet
[2:05:11] this morning. Amen. Help me enjoy that
[2:05:14] message this
[2:05:16] morning.
[2:05:19] Amen. Amen. A way to come back to the
[2:05:23] source that God has given. As brother B
[2:05:24] said, by the blood we come back to God.
[2:05:26] It's the only foundation that God laid.
[2:05:28] He laid it in the Garden of Eden. I
[2:05:30] believe it's our source of life this
[2:05:32] morning. You believe that? What a
[2:05:35] tremendous message and reminder and
[2:05:37] uplifting to know who you are and a
[2:05:40] place to draw life from. Amen. And
[2:05:43] that's our desire is to draw life
[2:05:46] eternal. Amen. Not just to satisfy our
[2:05:49] flesh, but to satisfy that longing
[2:05:51] that's in our heart and feed our soul.
[2:05:54] Amen. Do you love the Lord this morning?
[2:05:56] Amen. Can we sing it? I have a
[2:06:00] [Music]
[2:06:03] source of
[2:06:06] strength when I am weak.
[2:06:09] [Music]
[2:06:12] It
[2:06:13] takes me
[2:06:17] through when this life is
[2:06:21] pressing
[2:06:25] me. I
[2:06:27] have a
[2:06:31] source of
[2:06:33] power
[2:06:35] from above.
[2:06:38] Thank you,
[2:06:40] Lord, for I'm covered
[2:06:45] over
[2:06:47] by a shield of love. How many can claim
[2:06:52] it this morning?
[2:06:54] I claim the
[2:06:58] blood Jesus shed on
[2:07:03] [Music]
[2:07:07] Calvary. Those
[2:07:09] preious blood
[2:07:12] stains, they were laid there just for
[2:07:20] me. For all my
[2:07:25] sin, all my
[2:07:27] sickness and my pain.
[2:07:35] When I need
[2:07:38] healing, I
[2:07:40] claim those
[2:07:42] preious blood
[2:07:44] [Music]
[2:07:47] stains. I do not
[2:07:52] know how
[2:07:54] others make it through.
[2:07:58] [Music]
[2:08:01] who
[2:08:02] never
[2:08:05] go to
[2:08:07] Calary like we
[2:08:12] do. For I know there the
[2:08:17] healing and the cleansing stream is
[2:08:22] still flowing.
[2:08:26] and with peace that
[2:08:30] only his
[2:08:33] redeemed can
[2:08:36] [Music]
[2:08:38] know. So I claim the
[2:08:43] blood that Jesus shed on Calvary.
[2:08:49] [Music]
[2:08:52] All those precious blood
[2:08:56] stains were made there just for
[2:09:04] me. For all my
[2:09:09] sins and my sickness
[2:09:12] and my
[2:09:15] [Music]
[2:09:17] pain. When I need
[2:09:22] healing, I
[2:09:24] claim those preious blood
[2:09:27] stains. Amen. How many could claim it
[2:09:30] this morning? I claim the blood. Maybe
[2:09:34] you just need to lift it, need some
[2:09:36] encouragement, or just a refilling of
[2:09:38] the spirit of God here. He gave us a
[2:09:41] place to go to get it. Yes, my Lord.
[2:09:45] Those precious blood
[2:09:47] stains I know were made there
[2:09:51] just for
[2:09:53] [Music]
[2:09:56] me. For all my
[2:10:00] sin and sickness and all my
[2:10:05] [Music]
[2:10:08] pain. When I need
[2:10:13] healing, I
[2:10:15] claim those preious blood
[2:10:20] stains. Yes. For all my
[2:10:26] sin and
[2:10:28] sickness and my pain.
[2:10:35] Oh, when I need
[2:10:38] healing, I still can claim those preious
[2:10:44] blood
[2:10:47] stains. My is it wonderful to have
[2:10:50] something to claim this morning to lay a
[2:10:52] hold on when you need access to the
[2:10:56] source of life that God give us a place
[2:10:58] to get a hold of. Not only are we
[2:10:59] holding on to it, but it's what's
[2:11:01] holding on to us. Brother Aaron said,
[2:11:03] "It drew me." Amen. Do you believe that
[2:11:05] this morning? Amen. How many loves the
[2:11:07] Lord? Amen. We just praise him this
[2:11:10] morning for all that he's done for us.
[2:11:11] What a tremendous God that we serve. Can
[2:11:14] we sing that song you were playing?
[2:11:16] You're worthy of it
[2:11:19] all. You're worthy of it
[2:11:24] all. Yes, my
[2:11:26] Lord. You're worthy of it all.
[2:11:34] For from you are all
[2:11:39] things. And Lord, you deserve the
[2:11:46] glory. You are worthy of it
[2:11:53] all. Yes, you're worthy of it
[2:11:58] all, my Lord Jesus.
[2:12:01] For from you are all
[2:12:03] things. To you are all
[2:12:07] things and you deserve the
[2:12:13] glory. You're worthy of it
[2:12:19] all. Yes, you're worthy of it all.
[2:12:24] [Music]
[2:12:27] Oh, for from you are all
[2:12:30] things. To you are all
[2:12:33] things. You deserve the
[2:12:39] glory for you're worthy of it
[2:12:45] all. Yes, you're worthy of it
[2:12:52] all. For from you are all
[2:12:56] things. To you are all
[2:12:59] things. You deserve the
[2:13:02] [Music]
[2:13:05] glory. Lord, you're worthy of it
[2:13:11] all. Yes, you're worthy of it all.
[2:13:19] For from you are all
[2:13:22] things, to you are all
[2:13:25] things, and you deserve the
[2:13:29] [Music]
[2:13:31] glory. So I come to give you
[2:13:34] [Music]
[2:13:37] praise, Lord. I come to give you praise.
[2:13:45] For from you are all
[2:13:48] things and to you are all
[2:13:51] things and you deserve the
[2:13:57] glory. Lord, I come to lift my
[2:14:03] hands. Yes, I come to lift my
[2:14:08] hands to you, Jesus. For from you are
[2:14:13] all
[2:14:14] things, to you are all
[2:14:17] things, and you deserve the
[2:14:23] glory. Lord, I come to give my
[2:14:29] all. Yes, I come to give my all.
[2:14:37] Oh, for from you are all
[2:14:40] things. To you are all
[2:14:43] things and you deserve the glory. Can
[2:14:47] you give me praise this morning? Yes,
[2:14:50] Lord. I come to give you
[2:14:54] [Music]
[2:14:55] praise. Yes, I come to give you praise.
[2:15:03] Oh, for from you are all
[2:15:06] things, and to you are all
[2:15:09] things, and you deserve the
[2:15:14] glory. For I know you're worthy of it
[2:15:21] all. Yes, Lord, you're worthy of it
[2:15:27] all. I say, for from you are all
[2:15:32] things, to you are all
[2:15:35] things. You deserve the
[2:15:41] glory. Amen. Won't you give him a hand
[2:15:43] clap of praise this morning? Is he
[2:15:45] worthy of it all? Amen. How many can
[2:15:48] lift your hands? Say, "Lord, I give my
[2:15:49] all to thee. My life I surrender to
[2:15:52] you." Amen. You love the Lord this
[2:15:54] morning. I believe that's what God
[2:15:56] desires of us.
[2:15:58] you don't desire. I know. I remember
[2:16:00] when I was a kid, they used to have
[2:16:01] those signs on the the bumper stickers
[2:16:03] on the cars that said, "God is my
[2:16:05] co-pilot." I thought, "Well, that's the
[2:16:07] worst thing you could ever have. I don't
[2:16:09] need a co-pilot. God ain't nobody's
[2:16:10] co-pilot. He's your pilot." Amen. And if
[2:16:13] you're on board with him and then then
[2:16:14] then there's going to be safety. Amen.
[2:16:17] We ain't looking for God to fill a seat
[2:16:19] and and fill up the space when we need
[2:16:21] him or to take over when we we're
[2:16:23] looking for a God that can lead our
[2:16:25] life. Amen. How many can say amen to
[2:16:27] that? We want to surrender to him. Can
[2:16:30] we sing that song as we go? All to
[2:16:32] Jesus. I surrender. Amen. We just want
[2:16:35] to give all to him. We just want to
[2:16:37] remember those. I know sister Leah is
[2:16:39] going in in the morning 8:00 to have
[2:16:42] surgery on her neck. Just pray the Lord
[2:16:43] would be with her. We're going to be
[2:16:45] there with her and Blood John and and I
[2:16:47] just trust the Lord to bring her through
[2:16:49] it. I know it's the third time the
[2:16:50] doctor was kind of afraid to do it,
[2:16:52] especially in that region. Um, and you
[2:16:55] know, there's always the side effects of
[2:16:57] losing your voice and things like that.
[2:16:59] But, uh, you know, they've been they
[2:17:01] have to tell her all that stuff and of
[2:17:03] course to let you know, but I believe
[2:17:04] that we have a a God that is more than
[2:17:06] able and I believe that good doctors are
[2:17:08] gifts from God. And that this she said,
[2:17:11] "Well, the surgeon," he said, "Every
[2:17:12] time before he has a surgery, he always
[2:17:14] prays and ask the Lord to be with him."
[2:17:16] I said, "So will we." And I believe that
[2:17:18] the Lord will bring her through it on
[2:17:20] the other side. Amen. and have be able
[2:17:22] to recover from it and and and just a
[2:17:25] few days see her up there singing and
[2:17:28] just to worship the Lord and maybe God
[2:17:29] just put a song on her heart. Amen. And
[2:17:32] want to want to sing a special for us.
[2:17:33] Amen. And how many look forward to that?
[2:17:36] Amen. Well, praise the Lord. Amen.
[2:17:39] That's that's just good. We Well, we
[2:17:41] know Gabriella got it from somewhere and
[2:17:43] it sure wasn't Brother
[2:17:44] John. So, she's got to have No, I'm just
[2:17:48] Brother John sings pretty good, too.
[2:17:49] Amen. and you love the Lord this
[2:17:51] morning. Let's just sing this with all
[2:17:53] of our heart. Amen. As we prepare to
[2:17:57] go all to
[2:18:02] Jesus I
[2:18:06] surrender. All to
[2:18:08] him I
[2:18:10] freely give.
[2:18:14] I will
[2:18:16] ever love and trust you,
[2:18:21] Lord. In your
[2:18:23] presence, I'll
[2:18:27] daily.

[2:18:31] surrender
[2:18:36] all. I

[2:19:15] pleasures, all
[2:19:18] forsen. Lord, I give my all to Jesus.

[2:19:26] now.

[2:19:30] surrender
[2:19:33] all. Yes,

[2:19:37] surrender all.
