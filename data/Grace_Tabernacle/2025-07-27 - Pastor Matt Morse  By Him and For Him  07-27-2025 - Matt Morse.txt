How many's glad to be in the presence of the Lord this morning? &gt;&gt; Amen. How many loves the Lord? &gt;&gt; I mean say it's good to be in the house of God. Amen. And I can't think of any place I would rather be this morning. And and that to be able to stand in the presence of the Lord and the presence of his word and Amen. He is certainly a wonderful God. How many you enjoyed those uh specials this morning? God bless. God bless you, sisters. Just sure love the Lord and and just appreciate all that God does. And aren't you just happy to be in church this morning? I want to welcome everybody here and just may God richly bless you this morning and and our visitors this morning. God bless you. Just trust that the Lord would be able to say something that would be a help to you. And I know I hope nobody came to see me cuz I don't have nothing to tell you. But I know there's enough in the word that'll change all of our lives. Amen. So, uh I believe that's that's what we want. Amen. Is God uh to be able to move and to help us. Maybe we just approached the Lord this morning with a word of prayer. Y'all remember Uncle Randall in the hospital had fell and I broke a vertebrae I guess or three vertebraes in his back and was unstable and I just asked the Lord to be with them this morning. If you have a need on your heart, just just lift your hand, Lord. Also, Becca, they just had her baby there a couple days ago. So, uh, we just want to pray for her this morning. Let's just bow our heads together. Gracious heavenly father, Lord, we are so thankful, Lord, for an opportunity to come. And, Lord, just together in your presence, Lord, knowing that you know all things, Lord. And, Lord, I believe that you're an eternal God. And I believe, Lord, that you saw this meeting, this gathering of people, Lord, long before any of us ever was born upon this earth. And Lord, you have orchestrated this time, Lord, for us together. And Lord, to hear this word this morning that would be spoken. Lord, you know what we have need of. And Lord, you know where we're lacking. And Lord, you know what needs to be said to help us move further along in our walk with you. And Lord, I pray, Lord, that you would minister strength to the church this morning. Lord, I pray that you would uh minister help to them. Lord, those who are in need healing to those that need healing in their body. And Lord, I just ask you, Lord, to have your liberty in this service. Lord, may we just get out of the way and allow the the spirit of the Lord to move among us and minister to every heart. And Lord, we'll just be careful to give you the glory for all that you do. Lord, we pray that you would anoint this word this morning, Lord, that we would be able to receive from it and draw strength. We ask you these things in the name of Jesus Christ, we pray. Amen. Amen. How many loves the Lord this morning? &gt;&gt; Amen. Won't you just turn around, shake somebody's hand, and greet them the name of the Lord. Welcome in the house of God. Amen. And we just certainly certainly appreciate uh being able to gather together and and uh we just Brother Andrew asked the church to remember him in prayer this morning. He was preaching uh at brother Sean's up in VH Virginia. So we just trust that the Lord would use him in a mighty way uh to be a help there. Amen. and you love the Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. So good to be here this morning. I want to invite you to the scripture to the book of Colossians. And uh and we're going to read out of the first chapter and the 12th verse. And we'll just get right into the word of God. Colossians the first chapter and the 12th verse in just a moment just to get there. Colossians 1 and 12. Amen. How many appreciates these sisters up here playing it? Amen. &gt;&gt; Brothers, brothers, play in sure appreciate all that everybody does. And man, I just feel good this morning. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. It just something you can feel so terrible when you come in the house of God and just a few minutes it all just goes away. Isn't it wonderful just to get in the presence of God, it just changes everything. Amen. How many feels good this morning? Amen. I want to read Colossians in the first chapter and we'll read out the 12th verse. The Bible says, "Giving thanks unto the Father, which hath made us meat to be partakers of the inheritance of the saints in light, who hath delivered us from the power of darkness, and hath translated us into the kingdom of his dear son." &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; In whom we have redemption through his blood, even the forgiveness of sins. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Who is the image of the invisible God, speaking of Jesus, he's the image of the invisible God, the firstborn of every creature. For by him were all things created that are in heaven, that are in earth, visible and invisible, whether they be thrones or dominions or principalities or powers. All things were created by him and for him. &gt;&gt; And he is before all things, and by him all things consist. And he is the head of the body. I think Paul had quite a revelation of who Jesus really was, didn't he? He said, "And he is the head of the body, the church, who is the beginning, the firstborn from the dead, that in all things he might have the preeminence." Amen. &gt;&gt; For it pleased the Father that in him should all the fullness dwell, and having made peace through the blood of his cross, by him to reconcile all things unto himself. By him I say, whether they be things in earth or things in heaven, and you that were sometime alienated and enemies in your mind by wicked works, yet now hath he reconciled. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; And in the body of his flesh through death, to present you holy and unblameable and unreprovable in his sight. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; We'll just ask the Lord to add his blessing to the reading of the word this morning as you take your seats. And I would like to speak on this subject by him and for him. By him and for him. Now you know or many of you remember uh the story of the little boy that uh that had a desire to see God. He he had remember the little boy is a Sunday school age and and he had in his heart to see God and he went he went to his mama and started telling his mama. He said you know mama I wish I could see God. and and uh you know, she got to thinking on that and said, "Well, uh you know, I don't really know how to show him to you. Uh you know, maybe you should ask your Sunday school teacher that." And so the little boy went to his Sunday school teacher and he said, "You know," he said, "I I really want to see God." And I asked my mama and she told me, "Come and talk to you." And and the Sunday school teacher says, "Well, you know, I I don't really have an answer for that. Maybe you should go ask the pastor." And so the little boy goes to the pastor and he says, "You know, I really want to see God." And the pastor says, you know, you really can't see God anymore. You know, those days are over. You know, maybe when Jesus was walking on the earth and he was the image of God, you could see God in that way. But today, you can't see God uh like that. And so, the boy left there really disappointed. And uh you know how the story went. He got out there with old granddad and it was out in the in the uh lake and fishing and uh sitting out there and he could tell something was troubling him and something was on his heart. And finally, he just asked him, "What is it that's bothering you?" He said, "Well," he said, 'You know, I really have really wanted to see God. And he said, "I asked my mama and she couldn't show him to me. And I asked my Sunday school teacher and she didn't show him to me. And I asked my pastor and he said I couldn't see God anymore." He said, "It's just been really troubling me that I really wanted to see God." And you know, he looked over and that old old man, he's kind of looking out across the lake and tears started flowing down his face. And he looked back at the boy and he said, you know, he said, son, he said, all I've seen for the fa past 50 years has been God. &gt;&gt; He said, "Everywhere I look, I see God." He got to looking out at the nature and all the things of God and such a peace out on the lake. And I thought, my that's the way it ought to be. You know, there there's a way to see God. But remember said, "My first Bible was nature." He said, "I noticed everything taking place in nature how it had to be God." He said, "Nothing else could be that but God." And it led me to believe that even before he was a believer and before he gave his heart to the Lord, he said it led me to believe that there was some great supreme force somewhere that controlled all these things. I I thought that's the way it is, you know, with each one of us. Isn't it fascinating to see all the things that God has created? How how many has ever looked and seen how that God uh had made the moon and he made the stars and he made the sun and he made he made the planets and the earth and and how how tremendous of a thought it is to think about how that this earth this great ball is just hanging in the sky and uh in the midst of blackness of nothing that here here it would it would sit in its place and it would never get out of order. It would God keeps such an order. There's no way for our minds to fathom how that we're sitting in the midst of space and there's no strings attached. There's no uh there's no force there. Uh Brother Wesley, there's no physical thing that you could lay eyes on that keeps it in order. But yet, there's some supernatural force that keeps it in order and the and the perfect distance from the sun that it would be able to sustain life. I I don't know about y'all, but I think this planet is amazing. It's something amazing to think that uh that that God created it in such a way that it's in perfection that you and I can live and breathe and fellowship and uh you know you know I think how wonderful that God uh has created brother Wesley the vastness of his creation you know it goes from something great big to something so small you know you can see what God has made that the redwood trees that are 300 foot tall how magnificent it is down to the smallest little lily growing in a field from from a from a a blue whale that's 100 foot long down to a little betta fish in a fish tank that's so perfected in its colors and uh but but God he makes mountains and he makes oceans and you know it it's so beautiful to look at the things that god has created you know I thought about how that god is such a great creator and what a master that uh that he is and you know I was looking uh the other day about how that nature has inspired man to make things and you know that that God made it first I just say that God made it first. I know man has made a lot of things and they've created many wonderful things. The mind of man is a great thing that God created, but God made it first. And you know, I was reading about how the in the 1990s, you remember the the bullet train that went through Japan and and they had a great problem with the train because when it would pass through uh when it would pass out of the tunnels, it would make such a sonic boom uh that that it would disturb the neighborhoods. And so it was a great trouble. They uh they had such great debates about it. But one of the engineers on the train was a bird watcher. He was an avid bird watcher. And so he got to observing how that the kingisher, the the the bird, the kingisher would dive into the water. And because its beak and its design was so perfect that it would dive into the water at such a great speed, but it would never make a splash. And so the engineer said, "Well, if it don't make a splash in water," he knew that this train coming out is making it's making a great impact on that on that atmosphere. And so they actually changed the design of the train to model after the kingfisher. I thought, isn't it something that here when man didn't have no idea what to do, they found something that God had made and it gave them the answer to aerodynamics in such a way that they created a train that was uh it end up being 10% faster, 15% more fuel efficient. It took away all the noise. It exited the tunnel without making hardly a noise in the neighborhood. All because they took a and modeled after something God had made. I I thought there's many things I I won't have time to go through them all this morning, but there's many things that God made that man has modeled after. One of the things that we use every day uh came from a Swiss engineer in 1941 when he noticed a cuckle bar and he got to watching how it got caught on his dog's hair and he took a microscope and actually looked at the cuckle bar through a microscope and he noticed that on the end of the cuckar it had hooks and so and and on the hair of the dog there was loops in the hair that it made and the hooks would stick to it and he invented something that made multi-millions of dollars all after something that God had created in nature and you Uh there there's been many things. There was a you know the squid that's translucent in its color that they made windows the the uh that have changing colors and windows after a squid. One of uh one of the greatest wind turbines that was ever created was created after a a whale the the the big uh uh um um what do they call on the whale? The uh uh the the the the big arms that the whale has. The fins. Thank you. A fish has something. I knew it wasn't arms, but the fins on a whale. Uh but but it had these bumps on it and you know aerodynamics would say that the smoother it is the more aerodynamic it would be and so our wind turbines have always been real smooth but somebody had noticed how that a whale and great in its size that it could turn so agile it could turn like on a dime and how that something that great big and they actually by by science figured out that it was the way that their fins were created that would cause them to be able to cut. And so they took these very bumps that was on a whale's fin and put it on wind turbines and found out that the bumps on it actually made a more efficient wind turbine. They still don't understand why it is because it looks like that without the bumps it would turn better and it would be it would be better with if it was smooth. But they done it the way God done it. And when they done it the way God done it, it actually is a more efficient wind turbine. It creates more energy. It it resists great powerful winds that come uh that come against it. I thought it that there there's just many great things when we take the way God done it and we could apply it to our life. And you know my favorite one I read, I know you may have seen it on Facebook or different things. But uh but but if you ever study the paragrin falcon, how many's ever seen a paragrin falcon? And if you ever watch the videos, it's fascinating to watch a paragrin falcon because or a falcon they actually they they've been clocked at high speed. That falcon falls at 242 miles per hour. This thing can fly through the sky. There's actually videos online of a falcon hitting its prey in the midair and it looks like a bullet that just went by. It's it's so it's so fascinating to see this falcon. But when the United States actually built our B2 bomber, uh they built the B2 bomber and they modeled it after that bird. They actually noticed how that when God created this tiny creature that there was there was an an avenue where wind could travel through its nose that would move it away from its respiratory system. So it could travel at those speeds without losing its air or losing its uh ability to breathe while it was flying. And so they actually designed our B2 bomber after that very bird. And then and today it's a billiondoll machine, one of the greatest bombers that's ever been created. I thought, isn't it something that this tiny creature that God has placed the intelligence that was necessary for one of military's greatest developments here? Here, all it took was somebody taking and looking at at some tiny thing that God made. I thought my in the midst of all of God's great creation here, one just one little bird had enough intelligence in it that that could create one of the greatest developments that that we ever made in our military. You know what it tells me? That God makes things that men don't have the ability to make. I say God is a great God. God he's able to make things. It's far beyond our understanding. And you know, I think all of science and research studies, they they've done all they could to go back in time to and look back in all the recorded history. You know, there's only a few thousand years of recorded history. And so they can go back and what's been recorded and passed down from man, just a few thousand years and they and they they they look back and they search for one thing. They're they're trying to find our origin and trying to find where we came from and where does man come from and where is this beginning? And you remember maybe a year or two ago, I'd actually told the a story of a of the Cornell University biologist and how how that he he was a he's a man that that believes in evolution and he always talks about the uh the architecture of the human body and and and he would talk about our body and he would say it like this. He said that our body was not designed by an intelligent designer. He said because if anyone had intelligence would design the human body then he would not have made the food and the air come through the same hole where you could choke or or you could or or you could choke on something or die or something that way. He says so it proves to you that if it would have been an intelligent designer well he had put your mouth for uh to be able to eat in one place and he' have put another hole in the head somewhere that would be able to to to get air if it would have been an intelligent designer. He said, "So you can see that by that that that we were we had to evolve into this and it was not an intelligence. It was just nature." And matter of fact, he would make this statement. He said, "When you look at our bodies from an evolutionary perspective, you'll see more and more that we are not intelligently designed." You know, I halfway believe one part of this. If you look at anything in the wrong perspective, you end up seeing the wrong thing. See, so if you look at our body from an evolutionary perspective, you start feeling like that there's no intelligence behind it. You know, I've met some people that I thought that same thing. There must not been much intelligence behind that creation. But you know what? We're not looking at it from our own thought and we're not looking at it from an evolutionary perspective. But he he said, "See, you see more and more." I thought, "Isn't it something that here is a man that says that we were not intelligently designed?" And you know, this is his own words. We were not intelligently designed. And I thought, my, how could you say that statement and then use your own intelligence to dedicate your life to find the history of where we came from and the cure for diseases and the cure for sicknesses? I thought, what a foolish statement this is that we that we were not designed by any intelligence, but by my intelligence, I'm going to find out where we came from. That I wasn't designed by intelligence, but by my intelligence, I'm going to find out how to cure all these diseases that there aren't no cures for. I thought, isn't it something? Why is my mouth here? And why can I breathe this way? And why is my head made like this? But I'll tell you what the Bible said. The Bible said, "Oh man, who art thou that repliest against God? For shall the thing formed, say to him that formed it, why have you made me thus?" I thought, "What a silly theory that it is." That I'll just say it like this. I'm not I'm not going to allow a biologist to redefine what intelligence is. See, he said if it was made this way, then it was unintelligent. Well, that's his definition of of intelligence. Isn't that the way it is? But I I'm not going to allow him to change what intelligence is because there was an intelligence that created man. There wasn't an intelligence that made us the way that God made us. And let me tell you what it was. That intelligence made man in his own image and he formed man out of the dust to the ground. And then the Bible said he breathed life into him and man became a living soul. That means he came alive. That which was spirit it put on the robe of flesh and now he can see and feel and taste and smell and hear. He can communicate. He can reason. He can love. He He can hate. He can feel emotions. He can breathe. All because an intelligence created you. I know it may be beyond our understanding, but I will say this, but it's still true. &gt;&gt; Our God is a creator. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; How many believe that? Say amen. &gt;&gt; Our God is a creator. You know, I think of the greatness of God's creation. You realize that the same the same God of great power that made the that created all things that created the universe and made the heavens and made the earth and made the stars and the land and the sea and the greatness of God's creation. If you could take a moment and think about all the great things that God created by his own hand and formed it. The Bible said when God got a hold of the earth, it was without form and it was void and darkness was upon the face of the deep. But then the spirit of the Lord moved upon the face of the water. What was God doing? He was creating an atmosphere for his creation that when he would create, there would be an atmosphere that would be able to create life. But that same God that made all of that is the same God that made you and I. Let me tell you friends, we weren't accidentally made, but we were made in the image of God. You were made by God, and you were made for God. He created us in his own image. &gt;&gt; What a revelation it is to just accept that God made you. Can I just say that to today? Hey, you remember you remember little Aiden when he he came out there in the shop one day. I think I told this testimony, but I was out there in the shop working and he kind of wandered out of his dad's house and come out there and he likes to hang out when Uncle Matt's around and he come out there and he pulled him up a little chair and sat there and had his feet propped up and he was watching me clean out and stuff and after a little bit just out of the blue here it was dark and I had a little fire going out there burning stuff and he moved his chair over there to the fire and just kicked back in his lawn chair here. was, you know, in the middle of the night. We were just having oursel a time. And after a minute, he just looks over at me and he says, "Uncle Matt," he says, "How did God make man? Out of dust." Just out of the blue. I was sweeping up. Had a big tile pile of dust there. And I said, "Well, buddy," I said, "Well, God God made a body." And then he he breathed into it. And you know, it it took on the form of life. And and you know, he he looked over there for a minute and he reached down. He picked him up a handful of that dust and he got to dumping it out of his hand. He said, "I know, but dust is loose and we're solid. I thought, man, what a what a what a a catch for I He's about seven years old and and I said, "Well, buddy, you know you know if you take water and and I got talking about water and clay and how you put it together and how you can form and how you know uh pottery and and bowls and cups and how that they are molded into shape and what used to be one element was formed into another element and you know and then you know I realized that wasn't enough and and it's like yeah well that's just a you know a pottery it don't really you know it don't really have a a face and a mouth you know I said they can make they make figures that that have all that stuff, you know. Yeah, but it don't it can't breathe and it can't eat. And you know, I realized I was a little bit in over my head. So, finally I just said, you know, brother or buddy, let me just tell you. I said that that that God is a creator. He said, yeah. I said, but you know what a creator is? A creator is someone that actually brings something into existence. So, so by definition, a creator is somebody that can take something that isn't there and make something that is. That's what a creator is. I said, so the reality is God is just a creator. He made the laws. He made the elements. He made the earth. I said, "And just and the very fact that God formed the earth and he can make the earth, it just proves that he can make you and I." And finally, he just sat there for a minute. He said, "Well, you know what? I'm just glad God created me." I thought, "You know what? I think that's the way we ought to be this morning. I may not be able to understand it all, and I may not explain it all." He said, "But that's good. I'm just glad we were created." I I say, "I'm just glad I was created." I thought, isn't that something that a little boy has a better revelation of the things of God than a biologist had? Here when he tried to spend his whole life trying to figure out how God made things, but here a seven-year-old boy could just say, "You know what? I'll just accept that God made me." And I'm sure glad that he did. I thought you could spend your whole life trying to find out all the ways of God, but you'll never find out all the ways of God. There's some things you'll never be able to know. There's some things you won't be able to comprehend. There's some things you won't understand. That's what keeps people from serving God. They think they have to know everything and figure everything out and know all the ins and outs and see everything just like everybody else. But that ain't got one thing to do with it. It's just accepting God as God is and accepting you as God made you as a creation of God. He said, see there's Bible says God's ways are are pathf finding out and his ways are higher than all way our ways. You know, I think we can get caught up in all the all kinds of things that can get our minds so twisted and things that can't be proven and we can get so worked up about all these things around us and how this one says this is and this one says this is and never have any answer to it. We can bring confusion to our children. We can give them more questions than there are answers. But friends, let me tell you, we didn't come here to bring questions. We come to get the answer this morning. There's some things I just say it like this. There are some things that you will never figure out and some things you don't have to figure out. There's some things you don't have to know because that we have been already given the answer to it. So I think instead of spending time trying to figure out creation, I would rather spend my time getting to know the creator a little bit. Instead of trying to spend time figuring out how God did all of this and how if if God would make that and trying to prove that God did it, I'd just like to know the one that spoke out of his mouth and said, "Let there be light." And there was light. I I just want to know the one that created earth and created man in his own image. I want to get to know him better. &gt;&gt; The Bible said in the beginning God created the heaven and the earth. Elohim, the great creator. He made the heavens and the earth. Before there was a earth, it was the Lord. It was the Elohim. Brother said it was an allsufficient one, the strong one, the almighty Elohim. He was a self-existing God. Friends, I don't care how long you preach on that, you'll never understand it. You could study about it your whole life. You can never explain to me how God existed before there was anything that existed. Our human mind cannot comprehend eternity. It can't comprehend something not having a beginning and not having an ending because we are finite in this flesh. We come out of a from from our mother and back to a grave. We we we see a beginning and we see an end. Our mind is designed that way. We can't see past that. We can't fathom eternity. But by faith we can say our God is a self-existing God. Before there was anything, there was God. He was a great spirit that moved upon the face of the waters that created the earth that created me. &gt;&gt; He made us. &gt;&gt; God created us. It's beyond our understanding. But the Bible says God created man in his own image and in the image of God created he him. Male and female created he them. &gt;&gt; Somebody needs to read that. &gt;&gt; God created us. &gt;&gt; Male and female created he them. them wasn't a uh wasn't a pronoun either. He was just saying God created both of them, male and female. So don't get it mixed up. God created male and God created female. He created them in his image. See, can I say this this morning? He made us. Somebody say he made us. &gt;&gt; He made us. &gt;&gt; We're all different, but God made us. Isn't that wonderful? You look around this room, there ain't no two alike. We We uh Vanna had twins and ain't neither one of them alike. Bless their hearts. But one of them's got little nice straight hair. The other one has a little bit different hair. But that's how you tell them apart. They have a different head of hair. And it's true. They're both beautiful in their own way. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; One of them looks like she gets her hair combed. The other one looks like they put her finger in the lights on when she's old. Y'all make sure this this isn't this this CD isn't around or DVD or whatever. Make sure she'll coming after Uncle Matt. But God made us all different. We're all created different. Brother said God's a God of variety. He makes big mountains, little mountains, big trees, little trees, big deserts and mountains and oceans because he's a God of variety. You ever notice there's some of us are redheaded, some of us are blonde, some of us are blackheaded? We we are all made different. It seems like today everybody wants to be something else and then the way God made them. But I think that's because we look in the mirror and get tired of what we see. You know, somebody ever felt that way. &gt;&gt; You get in there. I remember one of the worst things when I came home from school after science class. I was so I was so tore up. My mom, she asked me, she said, "What's the matter?" I said, "I learned the worst news this morning in in science." She said, "Well, what is it?" I said, "I learned there's two things that never stop growing." She said, "What's that?" I said, "Your nose and your ears." She said, "Well, son, that's just I said, "Yeah, that means the rest of my life they're going to keep growing. You hear that, Mom? I'm talking about I mean, they're going to keep on Oh, man." She didn't understand what I was dealing with. But, but we all, you know, we we we want to be something different. But you realize that even though we may look in the mirror and we get tired of what we see, can I say this this morning that God Y'all can't stop looking at my ears. God bless you. I grew into them. My mom said I did. Amen. Well, praise the Lord. my face. Thank you, buddy. Thank you for your support. I like having my buddy on the front row right there. God bless you. See, sometimes we get we get tired of the way that God made us. &gt;&gt; But do you realize that God never gets tired of looking at you the way he made you? &gt;&gt; You may look at you and get tired of the way you look, but God never gets tired of looking at you. The This is what David had a revelation of. He said, "He possessed my reigns. He's covered me in my mother's womb." He said, "I will praise you for I am fearfully and wonderfully made." &gt;&gt; What a revelation it is that I know that God made me and I've been wonderfully made in the eyes of God. You know, you realize that that God made us in such a way that brother would say even we would resurrect that way. He said when you're redheaded that God made you. You'll rise up red-headed. If you're blackheaded, you'll raise up blackheaded. If you're blonde, you'll raise up blonde. He said because when you put a seed in the ground of a red flower, it'll come forth a red flower. And all of Christianity is based on resurrection. And the same one that went down, that's what it's going to bring forth. So God had created you that way. He meant for you to be that way. And even you say, "Well, I want to be perfect in the sight of God." So you're going to go by the way of the grave. And when you come up in the resurrection, you're still you're still going to look like that because that's the way that God had you in his image. So we don't have to go around feeling bad about the way God made us. That that's the way that God made us. He created us in his own image. And I can say this this morning, but when that not only did he make us, but we're perfect in his sight. I'll say whenever you show me a true born again believer in the or a son and daughter of God, I'll show you somebody that's perfect in the sight of God. You're the very image that God had made you. We're perfect. We may not be perfect in each other's sight, but we're perfect in God's sight. I'm not perfect in your sight. You're not perfect in my sight. He said, but what won't we just lay aside all that and see about what about God's side? We may not be perfect to one another, but we're perfect in the sight of God. Because we looked at you, you look at me as a human. I look at you as a human. We see each other as a brother. He said, "But when God looks at you, he looks at you through the blood of his son as a redeemed one." And Jesus said, "Be you therefore perfect, even as your father in heaven is perfect. It's not what you've done or nothing that you have merited it with, but it's Christ that died for you." See, so it's not the way we see ourselves. It's not the way we see each other, but it's the way that God sees us is what matters. How many believes that? Say amen. We may not be perfect to one another. We may not be perfect to oursel, but it's the way that God sees us that matters. Brother said, "God never made two people alike." There's billions of people in this world. Do you realize out of all the billions, none of them have the same thumbrint? None of us. That's why we take fingerprints and thumbrints that none of them are alike. That's so fascinating for our mind to be able to comprehend that God would make every one of us and every one of us be different. He said, "But but God made us all different." Said, "Not only were we all made different, but but we were just we were we were not just made by him, but we were made for him to fulfill his purpose." So here, God made us all. And then we have a purpose to fulfill. That's why he said, "Don't try to impersonate somebody else or because you do what God tells you to do and stay with it because there is not one person in heaven or on earth that could ever take your place." That ought to make you shout this morning. There ain't nobody could ever I don't care how you feel about you this morning. I'm talking about how God feels about you. There ain't one person in heaven and one person on earth that could ever take your place. You were made in the image of God. You were made for God for a purpose. He said and whatever purpose God made you, you stay with that. &gt;&gt; Ain't that powerful? Nobody can take your place. You have to be you and you you have to overcome and you have to allow God to be able to use you. You say, "You mean I have a purpose?" Certainly, we all have a purpose. Our purpose is to manifest Christ in this age. Our Our purpose is to grow into the image that God has saw us in in the beginning. Our purpose is to overcome this world and overcome the age that we live in. Our purpose is to get back to that Eden condition where God and man could have fellowship and perfection again. &gt;&gt; This is the purpose of the church &gt;&gt; is to manifest him. You say, "Well, well, brother man, how do we how do we manifest him?" Well, here's what here's what prophet said. He said, "See, we manifest him. A good pre a man that is a good preacher, he can manifest him by preaching the word. A man that's a good teacher can manifest him uh by teaching about it." I I could say it like this. A a gifted singer manifest God by singing. A preacher manifest him by preaching. Even Even Brother Bam's own gift of discernment, he said that gift was there to manifest the resurrection. It was to manifest Christ in the in the power of his resurrection just to show that he wasn't in a tomb somewhere buried, but to prove to this age that Jesus Christ was still alive and still doing the same work. It was to bring faith to the church that Christ was still alive and well. &gt;&gt; Not to build up a man or the following of a man. It was to bring faith in Jesus Christ to to to combat that spirit that would come in this age to say that Jesus Christ died 2,000 years ago and he was a good man and he was a good prophet and all these things that the world says about him, but but he died and they hid his body somewhere and they don't believe in the resurrection. They don't believe in the Holy Ghost. But the gift of God came in this age to prove the resurrection and to prove the baptism of the Holy Ghost. And it wasn't something that was just some other age, but it was for you and I today. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. So see all of us can manifest him. Said well how can we do it? Said we can manifest him by his nature. See how would God be known anyway? &gt;&gt; Can I ask you that? How would he be known today? You realize that Jesus has always been unrecognized. &gt;&gt; Can I say that? Even when he was on the earth, he was unrecognized. Many would walk by him and not recognize who he was or wouldn't accept him as a son of God. They matter of fact they crucified him proclaiming who he was or and because they were others that would fall on him even in this age. You see the spirit of God move and the Holy Ghost moving and and people being healed and the dead raised and blind eyes open and the supernatural moving amongst the church today. But still yet you say, "How can God have that great of a move and still yet the world not doesn't recognize it's him?" &gt;&gt; That he's always been unrecognized. But you realize that today &gt;&gt; that though the world may not recognize him, but there is a body of people that have always recognized Christ. Amen. &gt;&gt; There's believers that have always recognized and I believe this today that this is our day to recognize him. &gt;&gt; This is our opportunity. You say, "Well, brother Matt, if I was living in Jesus's day, let me tell you which one of them I would have been." &gt;&gt; You got to be careful how you say that. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Because there's people today that they're not believers. And you know, they they may mock you for what you believe, but but they say, "But if I was living in Jesus's day, I would have been following him around. I'd have been like a disciple." Would you really would you really been following him around whenever you said, "Well, I knew he was born of Mary and Joseph and I remember him when he was a carpenter's son and he was over there working and building furniture and stuff with his daddy." And then he would come by and said, "I I am the son of God. I was created by God." Here he was declaring himself to be the very son of God. And you would have followed after him and denounced your own church and left your own family. That don't follow after them heretics. and you would have left all your stuff at your house and followed Jesus around performing miracles and say, "I'm a follower of Jesus." &gt;&gt; Come on. &gt;&gt; Think about, be careful what you say. If I was there in Elijah's day, I would have followed after Elijah. I'd have been on Mount Carmel saying, "Go Elijah, call up on the name of your God. Your God will answer. Would you have been when Elijah when Elijah was a man that was an outcast to society and they wanted to take his life and he had to hide in a cave so that the so that the Supreme Court of that day couldn't get a hold of him and kill him like they were killing all the prophets. Would you have followed Elijah? &gt;&gt; Come on. &gt;&gt; You got to be careful what you say. Well, if I'd have been in the Bible days, I'd have been a believer then. If I'd have lived back then, I'd have been a believer. You realize that what you are today testifies about what you would have been. &gt;&gt; I'm going to tell you this. If you're an unbeliever today, you never would have been a believer. You could have seen Jesus perform miracles. You'd have came up with a reason or an excuse just like they did. They said he was be elabub. They said he was a magician. They called him a mind reader. They called him all sorts of things because Jesus was not recognized. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And I'll say this today, he's still not recognized. &gt;&gt; But there's believers. &gt;&gt; There's believers that recognize him. Said, "How can you recognize him?" You recognize him. I feel the spirit of the Lord. You recognize him by his nature, by his characteristic. You He's always been recognized by his nature. You think about the Bible through all the Bible. It prophesied concerning the day that we live in. But it also prophesies that there's going to be all the all the all the trouble and the chaos and all the wars and everything's been prophesied. But it's also prophesied that there's a people in this age that will recognize the day that they live in. &gt;&gt; The Bible tells that, you know, and not like the days of Noah. The Bible said in the days of Noah, they were they were drinking and and eating and before the flood, they were marrying and giving in marriage until the day that Noah entered into the ark. In other words, they were just going about their dayto-day lives until the day that Noah entered into the ark. They they didn't believe the message that he preached. And the Bible said, "And they knew not until the flood came and took them all away. And so shall the coming of the son of man be that they'll go on eating and drinking and marrying and giving in marriage. They'll go about their daily lives and they'll never have and they'll never know him. They'll never recognize him until judgment would come and take them all away. Let me tell you this friends, but just like there was those that received judgment, there was those that went into the ark and accepted the word of God and believed on upon the name of their God and they and they and the Bible says that they were carried over the waters of judgment. And I'll say this today that just like there was in the days of Noah, there was a bunch of new knocks, a bunch of no knocks that didn't know the things of God. And I think there's a whole world full of nos. There's a a new nos that don't know the things of God. But I thank God that I'm sitting in a building this morning with a bunch of people that ain't no that there people that have the knowledge and the revelation of Jesus Christ in the age that they're living in. &gt;&gt; I think it's powerful. Amen. &gt;&gt; The Bible prophesies that there's coming a day, but then it prophesies there's a people that'll recognize the day &gt;&gt; by revelation. They'll recognize the day that they're living in. And you know what? There's going to come, can I just tell you what the Bible says? I I'll just paraphrase it. There's going to come in the last days a body of believers that'll be known as the bride of Jesus Christ. And she'll believe the word of God. And she'll she'll desire to be with him. And he'll not only will he be with her, but he'll he'll his spirit will be in her. &gt;&gt; And she'll recognize her age, she'll recognize her position. And when she recognizes, it's going to unleash a power on her that's beyond human understanding. It's a power that's beyond reasoning. It's a power that's beyond our feelings. It's a power that's beyond sickness. It's a power that's beyond death. Whenever she recognizes who she is, no wonder the devil didn't want you to recognize who you are. said, "Because he knows if the people get a true revelation of the true church and what she is and what she stands for and that she can do the greater works, she will be an invincible army." That's why the devil don't want you to recognize who you are and what you stand for. Cuz he don't want an invincible army. He wants somebody that he can put down and somebody he can walk on and somebody he can step all over and put you down today and drag you through the mud tomorrow. He don't want a son and daughter of God that can stand firm on the word of God and say, "I recognize who I am. I recognize where I came from. I recognize who my enemy is. And I've got power over you. &gt;&gt; God has made me invincible to the tactics of the devil because I recognize who I am." &gt;&gt; From recognizing who you are, just from getting a revelation of who she is and what she stands for. Friends, let me tell you, I think that's what we need this morning. Amen. &gt;&gt; A revelation of what you stand for. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; Can I ask you this? Don't take this the wrong way. I'm not asking any person. I'm just putting this out as a blanket statement. &gt;&gt; Do you stand for anything? &gt;&gt; Do you stand for anything? &gt;&gt; That's the question to ask the world. What do you really stand for? &gt;&gt; What standard? What do you There's all all kinds of things. People fight over all kinds of ideas, but what do you what do you really stand for? Is there some foundation of something that you could say, I want to take my stand here. I'm standing for this. This is something that I I believe that we ought to know what we stand for. &gt;&gt; Say, "Brother man, what is it?" Let me just tell you, we stand for Hebrews 13:8. &gt;&gt; Jesus Christ is the same yesterday, today, and forever. I stand for that. I stand for that in front of the world that would denounce him a as a as a a God that only a God that could create, that would send his son, that would die, that 2,000 years ago he would lose the power that he had and wouldn't have power today. But I stand for the power of God. I stand for the message of the hour. I stand for the word of God. I stand for the baptism of the Holy Ghost. I believe we have a right to stand for something. &gt;&gt; You got a right to stand for it. &gt;&gt; See, when when revelation comes, you notice what do you do? Well, you can just give thanks to God that you have a revelation &gt;&gt; because the Bible said the eyes of your understanding have been enlightened. &gt;&gt; So, when you get a revelation, your eyes have been enlightened by something. &gt;&gt; That's what that's what a revelation is. You realize it's a dark age that we live in. Hearts are failing. People won't hear the word. The blind the they're blinded to truth. But can I tell you what the Bible says? Bible said it'll be that way. They'll be blind. They won't be able to receive truth. It'll be far away from them. But the prophet said, "But but in that day the deaf shall hear the words of the book, and the eyes of the blind shall see out of obscurity and out of darkness." I I don't know about you, friend, but I realize we're living in a dark age where people are deaf to the word of God, and they're blind to the things of God. But I thank God that there was a word in there for you and me that said, "But in that day, the deaf shall hear the words of the book, and the eyes of the blind shall see out of obscurity and out of darkness." I thank God that our eyes have became open that we shall know him, and we should see him in the power of his resurrection. &gt;&gt; He said, "How will we know him?" Said, "We know him by his nature. He does his work. He said Jesus said, "I am the vine and you are the branches." He said, "The branch bears fruit, not the vine. It's the branch that bears fruit." &gt;&gt; Jesus said, "I am the vine. You're the branches." The branch bears fruit. He said, "So the vine energizes the branch. And if that vine, you think about talking about the church." He said, "If that vine brings forth a branch and it has grapes on it, well then whenever that vine puts out another branch, what do you think it's going to put out? &gt;&gt; It's going to make grapes because the branch comes from the life of the vine." says, "So if the first church, Jesus said, I'm the vine." If the first church that come off of that vine was a Pentecostal church with all the gifts that ever really puts out another, if it ever really puts out another branch, they'll write another book of Acts behind it because that's what they had in the days of the apostles. And that a apostolic age has never ended. Are you hearing me? If if that's what the vine put out 2,000 years ago, if it puts out another branch in the year 2025, it'll be the same thing that'll produce as it did 2,000 years ago. &gt;&gt; Said, see, the apostolic age is never end. I know the church world don't preach that. &gt;&gt; They preach that the apostolic age is over. I've had that conversation with many denominational pastors. The apostolic age was just for the apostles and miracles were done only in the the disciples hands. It was only handed down from Jesus to the disciples. And that's as far as it went. And that that that power wasn't handed down through generations. I thought, well, you know, that may be become a a good sermon for a lot of denominational churches, but it certainly wasn't the sermon that Peter preached on the day of Pentecost. He said, "But repent every one of you in the name of Jesus Christ and be baptized for the remission of your sins, and you shall receive the gift of the Holy Ghost." And this promise is to you and to your children, and to them that are a far off, as many as the Lord our God shall call. That's the sermon that Peter preached. &gt;&gt; Said, "As long as God is still calling, then the apostolic age is still going on." &gt;&gt; For the promise, just like it was made then is to you and to your children as many as God shall call. So I say that this morning, for our sake and for our children's sake, I believe that God is still calling. &gt;&gt; I wonder how many can witness. Raise your hand. Say, I believe God is still calling. How are you a witness of it? Because you heard the call of God and you responded to the call of God. said, "Well, what's the call of God sound like?" Can I just tell you &gt;&gt; what's the call of God sound like? I'll tell you what it is. It's a draw in your heart. &gt;&gt; It's a pull in your heart. Maybe when you was a young girl, young boy that you felt the little tug in your heart that when when you would go to do something that was wrong and you knew it was wrong and then all of a sudden something would pull you. What was that? It certainly wasn't the devil. The devil ain't never pulled anybody to do right. It was the spirit of the Lord drawing you. You see, it's a it's a draw in your heart. It's not a force or a push. It's a draw. It's an attraction to you. Remember remember whenever Jesus was preaching at Capernium, he he said he was on earth to do the father's will and there was some that would cross seas to hang on every word he said. And others they they said he was just a carpenter son. But Jesus said, "But no man can come to me unless the father would draw him first." &gt;&gt; You notice does that not preach predestination? Unless the father would draw him first and I will raise him up in the last day. &gt;&gt; See, so he shows us that there's a great spirit that's doing the drawing. &gt;&gt; And here on earth, he was the image of that spirit. &gt;&gt; Said he was the image of an invisible God. &gt;&gt; But then watch what Jesus does. He turns around in John 12. First he says this causes confusion in the church world. The father unless the father would draw him. But then in John 12 he makes this plain. When the Bible says it would it would be the hour that the son of man would be glorified. Watch how Jesus says it. He said, "When I am lifted up, I will draw all men unto me." &gt;&gt; Say, "So, who's doing the drawing?" It's that same great spirit that was in the man, the flesh, Jesus Christ, which was the son of God. But it was that same God. You realize that everything God was was poured out into that flesh. All that God was was in that man. That's why the Bible said there ain't no other name in heaven or in earth that is above that name. It's the greatest name. We worship in that name. We baptize in that name. We serve God in the name of Jesus Christ. We recognize who he is. &gt;&gt; All that God was was poured out into the man Jesus Christ. It's the greatest revelation that you could ever get. It's the supreme deity of Jesus Christ. &gt;&gt; Know who it is you serve. &gt;&gt; He said, "When I be lifted up, I will draw. &gt;&gt; All men unto me." I don't think he was switching it up. Said, "Well, first it was the father. Now I'm now I'm going to do it." It was the same spirit &gt;&gt; that was doing the drawing. And let me tell you this today, that same spirit is still drawing &gt;&gt; cuz Jesus said, "I will send one unto you." Remember the comforter. I will come to you in the form of the Holy Ghost. You see who it was? It was Jesus Christ that was glorified. You realize that's what it is today. It's a spirit that draws us to God. &gt;&gt; It's not something you can see with your natural eye. &gt;&gt; It's a spiritual thing. It's the spirit of God that's dealing with a heart. &gt;&gt; Preachers preach words, but God deals with hearts. &gt;&gt; I can't draw you to something. I couldn't pull you to something. Only you can say that there's a draw on your heart or pull in your heart for something else. That there's something that this that in this life that you've never found satisfaction. You've never been satisfied, but there's something there's something there's a hunger and a thirst in you. &gt;&gt; Say, what is it? There's something drawing you. &gt;&gt; The Bible tells us in the days of Solomon, Solomon was a great man. &gt;&gt; Yes. remember a great king, one of the greatest that there ever was, the greatest wealthiest man that ever lived upon the face of the earth. But not only was he great in in in the natural, but as a spiritual man, he had the wisdom of God. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And the Bible tells us of a story that there was a queen that was down in the south, &gt;&gt; the Queen of Sheba. &gt;&gt; So she was a heathen. She was an idol worshipper. She was she uh you know they had those great gods like Deegon and all that &gt;&gt; said but but but somebody had to come by there one day and talk to her about what was going on in Israel. &gt;&gt; So one day maybe somebody would come by and they say you know I passed through the land of of Israel and you know we were down there you know on our on our journey and we stopped in and bought some things and and you know you you should see that country. You should see what kind of a meeting that they have up there. You ought to see what kind of people that they are up in Israel. You ought to see the kind of church services they have over in Israel and they and they got to testifying about the God of Israel and the and the and the man Solomon in Israel and how you know they they're they all have such great meetings and there's such wonderful unity in their God. is so alive in their midst and and you know you know they got a they got a God up there they called Jehovah and and Jehovah has a man in in in the office up there that he works through and and and he and he helps his people and he's vindicated himself right in the presence of those people. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Said it must have been a great talk because something in her heart began to desire to go meet Solomon. &gt;&gt; So see what was it? said, "These people saying that way down in the heart of this little queen," she began to wonder, "Well, I wonder if all that's really so." So, well, you know, waited till the next camel caravan came by. When they came by, maybe she went out there and asked them, "Has anybody gone by Israel? Have you have anybody anybody?" Yeah. Yeah. We came through Israel. Well, what was it like over in Israel? And they get to talk. Well, you know what? It's a great kingdom. They they have a they have a great palaces and and my how how they come. There's such wonderful order and they love their king and their and their king loves his God and their God is so alive among them. They got to talking about the supernatural and the things that took place in Israel until all of a sudden she couldn't help it anymore. &gt;&gt; You say, "Well, what caused a desire for the Queen of Sheba to meet Solomon?" It was a testimony that she heard. &gt;&gt; Think about it. It was just a testimony. She had to hear it from somebody. &gt;&gt; So for her to have a desire to go down there and meet him, somebody had to tell a testimony about what was going on in Israel. So when somebody told her about it, they told her about the God of Israel, they told her about this great Solomon and God, God's man, and then, you know, she'd sit there and think about and say, "Well, did you see the man they got up there?" "Yeah, we did." "Did you did you meet Solomon?" "Yeah, we saw him from a far off." "Well, is it true that they've got a God that makes himself known among his people?" "Oh, yeah, it's true." "Does he have the wisdom of a God?" "Yeah, he has a wisdom of a He knows things that men can't even explain. He knows things that happen in people's life, things that are going to take place in their life." Well, how would a man be able to know that? I don't know. It must be a god. &gt;&gt; And as they begin to tell her, said all of a sudden, her little heart began to beat. So, I think about what she would start, he said, we would start. Her heart begin to beat because somebody was telling her. She said, "But what if we would start telling people that stuff about our own people? &gt;&gt; What if we went to telling people how good our people were and how great our God was in our midst and how wonderful the Holy Ghost is instead of trying to run one another down?" He said, "What do you think it would do? It would cause people to want to be around He said, "You're the the Bible said you're the salt of the earth, but a salt can only it can only flavor if it contacts." You're the salt of the earth, but the salt can't do no good. It can't say unless it makes contact with the meat. See, so if you're the salt of the earth, you have to make contact in order for in order for it to be able to say. &gt;&gt; Let me tell you what happened. He says, "So what we have to be I think we need to just get real salty. And if we'll get salty, the world will get thirsty &gt;&gt; and then God's kingdom will grow." I believe that this morning. That's what happened. that somebody in the land of Sheba had got salty and they came through Israel and they're a little bit salty and they got to talking about the things of God and the things that they seen in the supernatural and testify about the mighty worship of God and how that God come through the gift of discernment and use this great man Solomon and all of a sudden because they were salty this queen of Sheba she got real thirsty I thought isn't it something that it put a thirst in a woman that had everything she was of great wealth I I know y'all's tired she was a great wealth music player should come God bless But she was a she was a great wealth. She had everything uh in the billions of dollars in our in our money. Great gold, great wealth, great ca castles, cathedrals, homes. She you'd think she never wanted for nothing. &gt;&gt; But because somebody was somebody was a little salty, she got thirsted for something else. You say, "What was it?" It was a draw in her heart. I thought, "Isn't that something?" It was the soft that put the draw there. Even they may not even know they were ever used. You know, their testimony is not in the Bible. the person that introduced the Queen of Sheba to the thoughts of Solomon or Israel. Their testimony is not even written in the scripture. You don't even know who they were that told her about it. But somebody had to tell her in order for her to know. And let me tell you, they may not they may be an unknown. They may not be nothing written about them. They may be just a little bit of nobody, but it was somebody that was salty enough to tell a testimony about what was going on in the kingdom of God. &gt;&gt; And it turned an entire nation towards God. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Cuz some little nobody that's not even written about, that's not even mentioned of was used of God to go into the land of Sheba and tell about the greatness of Solomon &gt;&gt; and Jehovah. &gt;&gt; And that little nobody that done their job. I think one day we'll meet them over on the other side. &gt;&gt; They're going to give us the name. Who are you? &gt;&gt; Well, you didn't read about me. Wasn't important. But I was, you know, I just I'm just preaching. Come on. &gt;&gt; You know, I worked for the Queen of Sheba and I heard a testimony. &gt;&gt; The people that came through Israel one day &gt;&gt; and it fell on my ears. You know, I got to think about all of our gods, &gt;&gt; great idols that we had in our kingdom, great God, day god, how many nights I had watched our queen and the leaders of our country and they would lay prostrate before these great gods, hoping that a spirit would come from that idol and anoint them and feeling like that the words that they thought from their own mind came from that God, that it was a spirit that came on it. But then I watched how Many times we would stand and it wouldn't defend us. And many times it would never rise up. It never had a voice. It never spoke. It never helped. But then I heard of the God of &gt;&gt; Israel &gt;&gt; and how that he would anoint the king to come down and he could look at a person's life and tell them something that was going on in their life that nobody else knew about. And when I heard about the God of Israel that had the ability to do that and something in my heart began to think about our queen, you know, she's never stood there and told people the things they were thinking. Our queen, our leaders have never stood there and told people the desires that was on their heart and desert their heart in that way. And we long for a reality. &gt;&gt; You know, I couldn't help myself. told the queen. &gt;&gt; There's a God that's real. &gt;&gt; I'm just going to say it like it is. There's a lot of churches. There's a lot of a lot of beliefs, but there's a God that's real. &gt;&gt; We ain't trying to get prestige. We ain't trying to build a great name, build some great church. We just want to know God. &gt;&gt; A God that's real. They told her about it. Reb said, "When God goes tugging at your heart," he said, "the ain't hardly anything that can keep you away from him." &gt;&gt; It ain't a man tugging, it's God. &gt;&gt; And when God goes tugging at your heart, said, "You know what she did? Listen, this queen, wonderful lady, this queen, finally her heart got to a place she says, you know, I think I'll just go find out for myself." Amen. &gt;&gt; She heard enough testimonies about what a God had done for somebody's life. And I wonder how many of us have been in that same place. I think I'll find out for myself. He said, "That's a good thing. You ought to make your choice. When something begins to be or begins to thirst, it's time to go hunting. You might think I may die one of these days and I don't know God." He said, "Well, you better get started." &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; That's God's red light. It's a sign of his coming. You better know God. You know what she found &gt;&gt; when she finally worked up the courage? She didn't care about, you know, can you imagine all the people around her that tried to keep her from making this journey? Don't do that. Don't take that step. Don't watch how the devil does today. Don't take that step. Don't don't don't take that walk. You know, you know what the rest of the nations say about Israel? They don't even they they they are a bunch of oh holy roller bunch of people and &gt;&gt; you know what the nations say about them don't follow after that don't go down there but something in her heart was draw your so she went she brought the gifts of gold and silver and garments of clothing camel train loaded with gifts and she came and laid it out down at Solomon's feet thought, "My, isn't it something here?" Even a queen, she showed her wisdom right there. She may not been known for wisdom, but she showed wisdom when she came before a god of wisdom &gt;&gt; and laid her gifts at his feet and said, "This is what I have to offer. I brought everything I could pack, all the camels I could get, everything I could carry." When she got down there, she found Israel was a god-fearing nation. She found a God that was real. She saw a gift of discernment. You realize the historians say today that Solomon told her things about her that were hidden in her life. Things that was actually about her physical body that were covered up that no one else knew. But in the presence of Solomon, he told her things on her body that nobody else knew about. Isn't that powerful? You know what she saw? She saw a gift of God working in his life. The Bible says Solomon told her all of her questions. Isn't that wonderful? He told her all of her questions and there was nothing hid from Solomon which he told her not. While she was looking for a reality, &gt;&gt; her heart was drawn to him. Notice what her response was. She said to the king, she said, "It was a true report what I heard about you." And you know what? I'll just say this that until I came here and my eyes saw it, only half, not even half of the greatness that was told about you, I've experienced. You've exceeded the fame that I have heard. Now, isn't that quite a testimony? I wonder how many can say that this morning that I heard testimonies about a real God. &gt;&gt; The reality of what God could do in a life, &gt;&gt; but my personal experience was greater than any story that I ever heard. &gt;&gt; I wonder how many could tell it. I heard that he could heal and it was wonderful &gt;&gt; until he did. &gt;&gt; I heard that he could save. I thought, "Well, that's wonderful until he did." &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; I heard he could deliver. Isn't it wonderful? Until he did. &gt;&gt; And my experience was greater. It exceeded the fame that I have heard about him. And friends, I tell you that this morning, &gt;&gt; my experience with God is far greater than any testimony that anybody could tell me about the works of God. &gt;&gt; I've heard about it. And finally, my experience is greater. Friends, I don't believe that any Christian should have to look back to see God. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; I don't think they would have to look backwards to see a move of God. I I don't think we should have to look backwards to see a revival. We shouldn't have to look backwards to see healing. We shouldn't have to look back to see the supernatural. &gt;&gt; It should be present among us. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; Listen what a prophet said. He said, "And truly, can you hear this this morning?" All of her questions answered, heart's desire was given to her. Her needs were met. Experience was greater than the testimony she heard. He said, "But truly a greater than Solomon is here." &gt;&gt; He said, "A greater than any of the prophets is here." There's no prophet that ever walked upon the face of the earth as great as the one that is standing in our midst this morning. He said, "For the Holy Spirit is here, the gift of God that he gave to the world." Friends, don't you realize it's the spirit of God that discerns the hearts by the word. It was that same spirit that stood there in the flesh of a man that discerned people's hearts. You realize that same spirit according to the word. The Bible said the word of God is a discerner of the thoughts and the intents of our heart. That that same spirit of God is discerning our hearts this morning. &gt;&gt; And that spirit that's moving around this building knows what we need to hear. It's what's drawing us. Won't you stand to your feet this morning? And it's the Holy Spirit that's pulling at our heart. The Holy Spirit that anoints the word of God that brings it to life. The Bible said, "He that hath an ear." Let me just give it a finish. He that hath an ear, let him hear what the spirit saith. &gt;&gt; It's the spirit that's calling us. &gt;&gt; The spirit of God. I wonder how many has an ear to hear. They can say, "I recognize God." &gt;&gt; I may not be the smartest man in the in the world, but there's one thing I know. I know God &gt;&gt; and I know he created me. And I know that he called me. That el Elohim, that great creator, he made me and he formed me. And he's called me to fulfill his purpose. And I want to manifest him. Lord, let me be salty this morning &gt;&gt; that somebody might be thirsty. &gt;&gt; Let me manifest a life of Christ. I don't care about your past. &gt;&gt; I don't care about where you came from or who raised you or what kind of environment you grow up in or or what kind of people or what theology they had. I don't care nothing about yesterday. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; I'm here to talk about tomorrow. &gt;&gt; God can take a young man, an old man, a young woman, an old mo old old woman. God can take us and mold us &gt;&gt; into the image that he wants us to be. &gt;&gt; God can take a life. I was a wreck of a life. Friends, if you if you could go back and run around with me for a few years, you wouldn't have any confidence in me if you looked at my flesh. &gt;&gt; I was a failure. I was a wreck when it come to serving God and the things of God. I I was an unbeliever. &gt;&gt; Come on now. &gt;&gt; You wouldn't have no confidence in me. And I can tell you this one thing. Many people, they told me, "If you can ever get a hold of God, he'll change your life. &gt;&gt; If you'll ever get a hold of God and God get a hold of you, it'll change your family. It'll change the history of your family, the story that's written about your family, it'll all be changed. What people tell about you, it'll be changed. The testimony about you, it'll be another testimony. And one of these days, all of that old stuff, they won't even talk about it no more. God will use you. &gt;&gt; Somebody told me that he can change you. He can use you. And you know what I found out, brother Robbie? The experience was greater than the testimony. Amen. &gt;&gt; When I met God face to face, the experience when somebody says God loves you and you say, "Well, that's wonderful. I need a God to love me." But when you experience the love of God, it's greater than anybody &gt;&gt; that could tell you about God's love. That God, he can heal you. The experience is far greater than anybody that could tell you about being healed. When you see the supernatural power of God drop into your life and take the symptoms out of your life and something that the doctor would say that's going to be there forever and God can remove it in just a matter of moments. The experience is far greater. Just bow your heads with me this morning. Maybe you just lift your hand. Say, "Brother man, that's the kind of experience that I want." God bless you, brothers, sisters. God bless you. He sees our hands this morning. That's the kind of experience. I don't want to just know the testimonies of what God has done and the stories of the mighty things that God has done and the people that that he's healed and saved and and used. But I want to know God by experience. God bless you, brother. I wonder if you say, "Lord, Lord, let me just know you." How many feels the presence of the Lord this morning? Maybe something that's pulling at your heart and say, "Well, I don't know what it is." I can tell you what it is. It's the spirit of the Lord that he's drawing your heart to have an experience with him, something supernatural. You've heard about it your whole life. You say, "Well, what did I do?" You do what that queen did. Can I talk to you a minute? Little queen, you've heard, you've saw so much. You've heard the stories, but you lack an experience. Is it worth a move for God to move in your life and to move into your heart like his? Is it worth a move back and say, "God, that's what if that's you really calling, I'll just find out if it is. If that's you really drawing me, I'll just find out if it is. I'll just go see for myself." Maybe just lift your hand. Lift your heart. God bless you, brother. God bless you, sis. A real experience. I want you to speak to me. You know, you just really need that. If not, your life will have no meaning. You'll leave this life in a few years. You'll have never had any meaning, no purpose. The emptiness that you feel will follow you to your grave. that you can have an experience that your testimony will change. You'll lead souls to God for the greatness of what God is doing in your life right now, this moment. I don't know what you came for this morning. I don't believe it was an accident. Somebody's was salty and you're thirsty. Lord, you see our thirst this morning. Lord, we've testified of your greatness, of the mighty works of God that's been done in our midst. Lord, I look around this room. God, my faith is so strengthened by the many testimonies that I see sitting in this building, God. Lives that have been changed forever, God. people that had served the devil so long. Lord, the world had pulled at them, destroyed their lives and their families, their marriages and their homes, the wrecks of lives that they lived. But Lord, then an experience came, Lord. You drew in their heart, Lord, and they met you, Lord. And we've got to witness the testimonies of the experience of God in somebody's life, Lord. There was an alcoholic that that the spirit of alcoholism was taken out of their taken out of their life. drug addicts that that the desire was taken from them, prostitutes and wrecked up lives and broken up marriages, God, that you've mended. Lord, we're looking at great testimonies of the Holy Ghost that's been moving in our midst, Lord. Many hands that's been raised this morning, Lord, that are testifying of a great experience that they've had with you. And Lord, here are those that are longing for that very thing. Lord, here set your queen. Lord, she's brought her gifts to you, God, to surrender them to you. All that she has to offer, Lord. The world may look at her as just some other person or maybe a nobody. But Lord, I know how you see her as a queen of heaven. Lord, and you've drawn her to this place to hear the words of life. God, may she have such an experience. Lord, may she leave this place today, God. This queen of heaven, God, knowing that this experience is a real thing that she met you, Lord, God, that she seen you move. She heard you speak to her heart and discern things that was in her life that no man would even know. I may that be her testimony today. Oh, we thank you Lord. We love you. Thank you for all you do for us in Jesus name. All the earth. [Music] &gt;&gt; Having us sing it this morning. How great it is. We met her song when she left the palace of Solomon is our God. Oh, we see he how great, how great. The Bible tells us that she went back into her own land and she took home the God of Israel. Took home the God Jehovah, the idols out of her land. You know, one of the greatest things that about the excavations of Israel was here just a few years ago. The men that was digging down into the temple of Solomon, they found a piece of pottery down there that they didn't know what was had a language that they couldn't be identified. And they took it to a linguist. I met the man that was with them or his uh his church that was with them when they found the pottery in Israel. He flew in on a plane. They do a lot of excavations there. and and and I met him and he told me and showed me pictures of it and and told me he said we didn't even know what the writings meant and had no idea what it was and we finally got to a linguist that said you know what that is the ancient language of Sheba and here it was a measure it was a a piece of pottery that measured grain from the land of Sheba and it was the first thing that's ever been found in the land of Israel that came from Sheba he said I thought it wasn't it powerful that here 2,000 or or 5,000 years later that There is still evidence that that queen made it to the house of Solomon. I thought, my but even without it, I believe that she made it. Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; And I believe that there's people here this morning, there's evidence that you made it to the house of Solomon. There's evidence that you made it to the to the presence of the Holy Ghost. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; I believe if somebody excavated our life, they're going to found evidence. &gt;&gt; There's shards of our life that's evidence that we made it. I wonder how many could lift your hands. Say, "Brother man, I want my life to be evident that God that I was in the presence of God. Let me leave something in his presence and let let him leave something in my let me lay down something in his presence." &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; That years and down the road, it'll be found. I wasn't carrying it. I laid it down in the presence of Solomon. I left him there. I gave it to him. &gt;&gt; And I came home carrying a new God. &gt;&gt; A real living God, &gt;&gt; an experience. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Amen. Abraham said, "We don't lay prostrate before our before an idol, but we lay prostrate before the Holy Spirit waiting for the spirit of God that is on God to come into our heart, into our life. It'll change our whole life." That's our experience. &gt;&gt; I say he's a great God this morning. Oh, I say, how great is our God? Sing with me. How great is our God? Oh, see how great, how great is our God. [Music] You're the name above all name. You are worthy of all praise and our heart will sing our praise is our God.
