[45:42] just say this tonight. It's okay to get
[45:43] into the spirit and let God have his
[45:46] way.
[45:47] &gt;&gt; Amen. I just say it's good to see
[45:49] everybody tonight. See brother Glenn
[45:50] back there and been a while since he's
[45:52] been able to go to church and after he
[45:55] was hit by a car and and uh is lucky to
[45:58] be alive. who's actually standing
[45:59] outside of his vehicle when a car came
[46:01] down a a hill on ice and hit him. Been
[46:04] through several surgeries and unable to
[46:07] walk and and move and bedridden at times
[46:10] and been battling through uh many uh uh
[46:13] different things physically over the
[46:15] past several months. So, I just say God
[46:17] is good. He's merciful and we've been
[46:19] praying for him. It's sure good to see
[46:21] you [music] able to get out and and and
[46:24] come to church tonight. So, uh, we we
[46:26] just we just want to we just want to get
[46:28] out of the way and let God have his way.
[46:30] &gt;&gt; Amen. How many come to have church
[46:32] tonight? And we don't want to put a
[46:34] limit on God. And everybody's going to
[46:36] get fed tonight. So, and you're going to
[46:38] get fed in the natural, so we may as
[46:39] well get fed in the spiritual. And and I
[46:42] think I think we just need to enter into
[46:44] the spirit and be influenced by the
[46:45] spirit of God. And I'm going to read you
[46:48] something out of the out of the the
[46:50] Patmas vision.
[46:51] said, "Have you ever noticed how the
[46:53] world gets into the spirit of the things
[46:55] that are in the world and they go to the
[46:57] ball games and sporting events and the
[46:59] dances and and enter into the spirit of
[47:01] it? They don't sit there like wall
[47:03] flowers and old dried up sticks, but
[47:05] they enter right into the feel of things
[47:07] and they become part of it. But oh, how
[47:10] they hate the Christians for getting
[47:12] into the spirit of God's word. They call
[47:14] us fanatics and holy rollers and there's
[47:17] nothing they won't do to show their
[47:19] hatred or disapproval. But here's some
[47:21] advice for you tonight. Are you ready?
[47:23] You just ignore that.
[47:25] Somebody say it with me. You just ignore
[47:28] that. You can expect it knowing where it
[47:30] come from, but you just go on and get in
[47:33] the spirit of worship.
[47:35] &gt;&gt; So you ignore whatever it is that would
[47:37] try to quench that or put that out and
[47:39] go on and get in the spirit of worship.
[47:41] See, because our spirit is clean. It is
[47:44] fresh. It is real. It is sober. It's
[47:47] serious. But nonetheless, it's full the
[47:49] joy of the Lord. And the Christian ought
[47:51] to be just as exuberant and full of the
[47:54] pleasure in the Lord as the world is
[47:56] when it savors and delights in it
[47:58] pleasure in its pleasures. I think we're
[48:00] exuberant. How many's exuberant tonight?
[48:02] Amen. We are to be exuberant and so on
[48:05] fire for God. And we're emotional
[48:07] creatures. And you know what brother Bam
[48:09] said? He said, "But our emotions are on
[48:11] the Lord of glory." The whole We're all
[48:13] emotional creatures and people get
[48:15] emotional about a lot of things. He
[48:17] said, "But we our emotions are on the
[48:19] Lord of glory." So I just say this
[48:21] tonight, we the if the world can go out
[48:23] there and get and get into a ball game
[48:25] and and they get emotional about win no
[48:28] matter what. And they get emotional
[48:29] about about doing their cha slide. Don't
[48:32] you get on me when I get a little
[48:34] emotional about about I'm going to rise
[48:36] above it all and let a brother get a
[48:38] microphone and talking about a man that
[48:40] was lost in sin and God took him and
[48:42] rose him above it. Don't get on me when
[48:44] I get a little emotional about it. Cuz
[48:46] there's something on the inside of me.
[48:47] Say what it is. My emotions are on the
[48:50] Lord of glory.
[48:52] &gt;&gt; David danced before the ark. Why did he
[48:54] dance? Because his emotions were on the
[48:56] Lord of glory. I wonder how many tonight
[48:58] I can say my emotions are set on the
[49:00] Lord of glory. So go ahead and get in
[49:02] the spirit of the thing. Amen. And we
[49:05] can get in the spirit of whatever we're
[49:06] in. We can get in the spirit of the
[49:07] Lord. So if God is moving tonight, you
[49:09] just go ahead and get in the spirit of
[49:11] worship. Get in the spirit of ministry
[49:13] and get in the spirit of Holy Ghost
[49:14] filled preaching and and get in the
[49:16] spirit of pulling from the gift of God
[49:18] and let God have his way in our life.
[49:20] &gt;&gt; This is the last service you'll ever
[49:22] have this year.
[49:24] &gt;&gt; Amen. I I'm not going to enter into it
[49:26] without getting into it.
[49:27] &gt;&gt; Amen. It's my l How many can get into it
[49:29] tonight. Just get into the spirit. Don't
[49:32] be Don't be stagnated, but get some joy
[49:34] and our salvation. How many say that
[49:36] tonight with me? My emotions are on the
[49:39] Lord of glory.
[49:41] &gt;&gt; Amen. Somebody give the Lord a hand clap
[49:43] of praise for all that he's done for you
[49:45] this year. All that he's been to you
[49:48] this year. He's a great big God and he
[49:51] deserves our praise. key of thee. Well,
[49:54] I've
[49:55] got a feeling.
[49:57] Oh, everything's going to be [music] all
[50:00] right.

[50:08] [music] going to be all [singing] right.

[50:18] right.

[50:22] Be all right.
[50:25] Be [music and singing] all right.
[50:30] Well, God sent Moses to lead all his
[50:33] people out. And Pharaoh's heart was
[50:36] hard. He thought he'd give them a new
[50:38] route. So, he [music] chased them
[50:40] [singing] all down to the Red Sea shore.
[50:44] He thought he wouldn't have to worry
[50:46] about Moses anymore. [music]
[50:48] But Moses stretched his rod out over the
[50:52] sea. And the Lord answered [music] Moses
[50:55] with a little gentle breeze. I can see
[50:58] Moses now with a smile on his face. Just
[51:02] telling all the people with [music] his
[51:05] gentle [singing] grace. Oh, I
[51:09] got this feeling

[51:34] Be all right.
[51:36] Be all right.
[51:38] Be all right.
[51:43] Well, a little boy named David went out
[51:46] to fight a giant. And everybody laughed
[51:50] at such a funny little side, a little
[51:53] shepherd boy armed only with a [music]
[51:56] sling. And beside mighty Goliath seemed
[51:59] such a puny little thing. But David
[52:02] said, "You come to me with spear and a
[52:05] sword, but I come to you in the name of
[52:10] the Lord." And he put in a stone and he
[52:13] gave it a sling. And when he left his
[52:17] hand, David, he began to sing. Oh, I
[52:22] got a feeling. Hallelujah. Thank you.
[52:25] Oh, I'm going to be all I say that I'
[52:31] got a feeling. [music]

[53:11] trouble you had, it's going to be okay.
[53:13] &gt;&gt; Amen. Do you believe that tonight?
[53:15] &gt;&gt; Can I tell one more?
[53:17] &gt;&gt; Tell it.
[53:17] &gt;&gt; And now for the greatest
[53:20] story [singing] of them all.
[53:23] My Jesus was a dying
[53:26] and hell had all [music]
[53:29] for all the demons were rejoicing.
[53:33] They thought they had won the war, but
[53:36] soon they would not be laughing anymore.
[53:42] Cuz on that first Easter morning when
[53:45] the sun woke [music] up the [singing]
[53:46] earth, then the caverns of the deep
[53:50] opened up as to give birth. And then a
[53:54] resurrected savior with healing in his
[53:57] wings. And now the host [music] of
[54:00] children and rise and sing. Well, I've
[54:05] got a feeling.
[54:07] Oh, everything's going to [music] be all
[54:10] right.
[54:12] Oh,
[54:14] I've got a feeling [singing]
[54:16] that everything's going to be all right.
[54:22] I
[54:24] got a feeling
[54:26] everything's going to be all right.
[54:30] Be all right.
[54:32] Be all right.
[54:35] Be all right.
[55:35] Hallelujah.
[56:23] &gt;&gt; [music]
[56:31] &gt;&gt; 25ation.
[56:52] Father
[56:58] present
[57:04] together
[57:09] [music]
[57:17] All right.
[57:27] [music]
[57:29] They're standing up on the reitsu
[57:41] [music]
[57:44] and all the problems and different
[57:45] things.
[57:49] at the same time
[57:51] all the time
[57:55] out of no ways when our when we were
[57:57] sick and body Lord when loved ones were
[57:59] at the point of death and you come on
[58:01] the scene as Jehovah Rafa Lord if
[58:03] anybody's got a right tonight to be
[58:05] happy it's the bride of Jesus Christ
[58:08] Lord you brought us through another year
[58:10] and Lord as we're going to speak your
[58:11] word I pray you would come I pray you
[58:14] would come in revelation Tonight, may
[58:16] you drive out every spirit, oh God,
[58:18] that's unlike the Holy Spirit and may
[58:20] your anointing find a right away among
[58:22] this congregation, Lord, the hands that
[58:24] have been raised, Lord, asking you,
[58:26] Father, Lord, just come by my way and
[58:28] speak something special to me. Lord, you
[58:30] will in no wise turn away one of yours,
[58:32] Father. Lord, help me to get myself out
[58:34] of the way tonight. My feelings, my the
[58:37] things I've studied, the things I've
[58:39] looked at, Lord. Lord, I surrender
[58:41] myself to you. have your way among us
[58:42] tonight and we'll be sure to give thee
[58:44] all the praise, all the honor, and all
[58:47] the glory. For it's in the wonderful
[58:48] name of our Lord and Savior Jesus
[58:50] Christ, we pray. And all the believers
[58:53] says, "Amen." And amen. If you have your
[58:56] Bibles tonight, we'll invite you in the
[58:58] word of the Lord. We want to go to the
[59:00] book of Jude, the book of Jude, the
[59:02] first chapter. And then we're going to
[59:03] go to the book of St. Mark, the 11th
[59:05] chapter. Amen.
[59:07] The book of Jude, the first chapter. And
[59:09] I just want to pick up there again in
[59:11] that third verse of Jude chapter 1 and
[59:14] verse number three. You love the Lord.
[59:17] Tonight,
[59:19] &gt;&gt; Jude here writing, he says, "Beloved,
[59:22] when I gave all diligence to write unto
[59:24] you of the common salvation, it was
[59:27] needful for me to write unto you and to
[59:30] exhort you that you should earnestly,
[59:33] now we looked at that Sunday, not
[59:34] half-heartedly, but with everything
[59:36] that's within you, contend for the
[59:40] faith, not contend for faith, but the
[59:43] faith which was once delivered unto the
[59:46] saints. Now in the book of St. Mark the
[59:48] 11th chapter,
[59:50] St. Mark chapter 11 and the 12th verse.
[59:55] St. Mark 11
[59:58] verse 12.
[1:00:01] This is a very uh familiar scripture to
[1:00:03] us as believers. I believe it's one of
[1:00:05] the promises that was was a u was left
[1:00:08] for this generation in St. Mark 11 and
[1:00:11] verse 12. And on the marorrow when they
[1:00:14] were come from Bethany, he was hungry.
[1:00:17] And seeing a fig tree a far off having
[1:00:19] leaves, he h far off having leaves, he
[1:00:22] came if happily he might find anything
[1:00:25] thereon. And when he came to it, he
[1:00:27] found nothing but leaves, for the time
[1:00:30] of figs was not yet. And Jesus answered
[1:00:34] and said unto it, "No man eat fruit of
[1:00:37] thee hereafter forever." And his
[1:00:39] disciples heard it. Now, if you skip
[1:00:41] down to the 19th verse, and when Eve was
[1:00:44] come, he went out of the city. And in
[1:00:46] the morning, as they passed by, they saw
[1:00:48] the fig tree dried up from the roots.
[1:00:51] And Peter calling to remembrance, saith
[1:00:53] unto him, Master, behold, the fig tree
[1:00:56] which thou cursed is withered away. And
[1:00:59] Jesus answering and saith unto them,
[1:01:01] Have faith in God. How many knows the
[1:01:04] prophet of God taught that and said,
[1:01:05] Have the faith of God. For verily I say
[1:01:08] unto you, that whosoever shall say unto
[1:01:12] this mountain, Be thou removed, and be
[1:01:13] thou cast into the sea, and shall not
[1:01:16] doubt in the heart, but shall believe
[1:01:18] that those things which he saith shall
[1:01:20] come to pass, he shall have whatsoever
[1:01:24] he saith. Now therefore I say unto you,
[1:01:28] what thingsoever ye desire when you
[1:01:31] pray, now watch this, believe that ye
[1:01:34] receive. Let's say that together.
[1:01:36] Believe that ye receive them and ye
[1:01:39] shall have them. We ask the Lord this
[1:01:42] evening to bless the reading of his word
[1:01:43] as you can have your seat here uh this
[1:01:46] afternoon. I I want tonight by the help
[1:01:48] of the Lord for for just a few moments
[1:01:50] here this evening if I would uh take a
[1:01:52] title tonight. I want to speak to you on
[1:01:54] this appropriating the faith. We were
[1:01:57] speaking Sunday morning on contending
[1:01:59] for the faith. Tonight I want to speak
[1:02:01] to you on appropriating the faith. And
[1:02:03] 1955, Brother Bram's preaching again in
[1:02:05] earnestly contend for the faith,
[1:02:07] Chicago, Illinois. He says, "Now,
[1:02:09] Father, these few broken words that have
[1:02:11] been spoken now some 45 minutes long
[1:02:13] tering
[1:02:19] of the message, the word to get to the
[1:02:21] people. If they can only receive the
[1:02:24] word, then they'll have you in their
[1:02:26] hearts." Ain't that simple? If they can
[1:02:28] only receive the word, then they'll have
[1:02:30] you in their hearts. And when I am miles
[1:02:33] away, they will still have the faith
[1:02:36] that was once delivered to the saints.
[1:02:38] Amen. Father, the best of my knowledge,
[1:02:40] I have told the truth. And all that I
[1:02:42] know how to say that is the truth. It's
[1:02:45] the faith. And now, Lord Jesus, you who
[1:02:48] so wonderfully said these words, I'll be
[1:02:50] with you even in you until the end of
[1:02:53] the world. He says, "Now want you come
[1:02:55] tonight and manifest your resurrection,
[1:02:58] in the power of deity, in the power of
[1:03:00] vision, in the power of healing, in the
[1:03:03] power of forgiveness of sins. Manifest
[1:03:05] yourself to this." He says, "We wanting
[1:03:08] children hungryhearted." Now, this is
[1:03:10] where I want to draw this from. We want
[1:03:12] to see the manifestation of the faith
[1:03:15] that was once delivered to the saints.
[1:03:17] Amen. We want to see the manifestation
[1:03:20] of the faith that was once delivered to
[1:03:23] the saints. Now, no matter how many
[1:03:25] times you come, Lord, I still love it.
[1:03:27] Amen. I want to see it again and again
[1:03:30] and again. Amen. For I love you and I
[1:03:33] want to be with you forever. Now, I can
[1:03:35] stop there tonight and say that's the
[1:03:37] desire of my heart. Amen. Is I want to
[1:03:39] see the manifestation of the faith of
[1:03:42] God. Amen. Not just on Wednesday night
[1:03:44] or on Sunday morning or in a special
[1:03:46] meeting. Amen. But I believe that as
[1:03:48] believers, we have a right by redemption
[1:03:50] to see, Amen. the faith of God
[1:03:53] manifested in our lives every day of our
[1:03:56] lives. Now he said another place may we
[1:03:58] purpose in our hearts tonight to be
[1:04:00] quiet. Amen. Before the Lord and wait
[1:04:02] upon him. He says wait. He says moment
[1:04:05] by moment expecting the right word to be
[1:04:08] said or the right thing to be done. He
[1:04:10] said that would give us the appropriate
[1:04:13] faith. Amen. That would dash right into
[1:04:15] the blessings of God. Amen. AMEN. I
[1:04:18] THINK THAT'S powerful that Satan does
[1:04:19] not want you. Amen. in the blessings of
[1:04:22] God. BUT HERE A PROPHET IS SAYING, AMEN,
[1:04:25] that when the word begins to come forth,
[1:04:27] that the word, amen, will literally
[1:04:29] clear a way between you and the
[1:04:31] blessings of God and you can move into
[1:04:34] them. Then that tells me that it's
[1:04:35] actually spiritual warfare, amen, that's
[1:04:38] not wanting you to go into the blessings
[1:04:40] of God. The prophet of God would say,
[1:04:42] "Now the Holy Spirit moves the same
[1:04:44] today." Right? He said Paul and is going
[1:04:46] away. He said, "After I'm gone, grievous
[1:04:49] wolves will enter in." Amen. And they
[1:04:51] will not spare the flock. He said,
[1:04:53] listen, though we are an angel, he goes
[1:04:55] to Galatians 1 and he says, "Though we
[1:04:57] or an angel from heaven would preach any
[1:04:59] other gospel to you." Amen. Than that
[1:05:01] which has already been preached, let him
[1:05:03] be accursed. He then ties Galatians 1 to
[1:05:06] Jude 1 and says, "Beloved, I gave all
[1:05:09] diligence to write unto you that you
[1:05:10] would earnestly contend." Amen. For the
[1:05:13] faith that was once delivered to the
[1:05:15] saints. He said, "Now, do you see what
[1:05:17] the faith is?" Now, watch this. If your
[1:05:20] church, if your church teaches that AND
[1:05:22] EXERCISES THAT, GOD BLESS YOU. HE SAID,
[1:05:25] "BUT IF IT DOESN'T, AMEN. THEN KEEP
[1:05:27] PRAYING UNTIL GOD COMES." AMEN. And
[1:05:30] vindicates himself. He said, "There's a
[1:05:32] Cain in the midst of you." Now, Amen. I
[1:05:35] know one might SAY THAT'S IMPOSSIBLE.
[1:05:37] AMEN. BECAUSE CAIN is dead AND HE'S NOT
[1:05:39] HERE TONIGHT. BUT A PROPHET OF GOD SAID,
[1:05:42] HE SAID, "AS she the bride is a part of
[1:05:44] the groom." He said, "True to him in
[1:05:46] every point, waiting for the wedding."
[1:05:48] Amen. uniting not at the ecumenical
[1:05:50] council but in the sky at the wedding
[1:05:52] supper. He said she has been given and
[1:05:55] revealed to her. Amen. I'm talking about
[1:05:57] you. Amen. The seven seal mysteries of
[1:06:00] the Bible. He said SHE SEES THE FOLLY of
[1:06:04] the deceiver. Amen. AMEN. THIS BRIDE IS
[1:06:06] NOT IGNORANT SAINTS. THIS BRIDE IS NOT
[1:06:09] CONFUSED BUT SHE SEES. AMEN. THE FOLLY
[1:06:12] OF THE DECEIVER. AMEN. It's so very
[1:06:14] CLOSE TO THE TRUTH THAT it would deceive
[1:06:17] the elect if it was possible. HE SAID,
[1:06:19] "NOW, DO YOU SEE, AMEN, those two
[1:06:22] opposing spirits, Amen, at work in this
[1:06:25] evil age?" Can you see it? Amen. Each
[1:06:28] are very religious. He said Cain and
[1:06:30] Abel, Amen, their spirits again, Amen.
[1:06:34] are coming to their heads. Amen. Still
[1:06:36] the same as they started. Amen. One is
[1:06:40] WORSHIPING BY BEAUTY, BY KNOWLEDGE, AND
[1:06:42] BY EDUCATION, AND BY SCIENCE, AND by
[1:06:45] ethics. Now, that's one. Amen. And the
[1:06:48] other one is worshiping by the faith of
[1:06:50] the revelation OF THE WORD OF GOD. NOW,
[1:06:52] WATCH A PROPHET. AND BOTH OF THEM IS
[1:06:55] STANDING RIGHT HERE IN THIS BUILDING
[1:06:58] this morning. NOW, AMEN. THAT'S ALL THE
[1:07:00] WAY IN 1965.
[1:07:02] AMEN. That the spirit of Cain and Abel,
[1:07:04] AMEN, WAS STILL ALIVE and it was still
[1:07:06] well. Can I PREACH TO YOU TONIGHT? AMEN.
[1:07:09] AND I WANT TO BRING IT RIGHT HERE TO
[1:07:11] 2025. AMEN. RIGHT HERE IN THIS BUILDING
[1:07:14] TONIGHT. AMEN. THE SPIRIT OF CAIN is
[1:07:16] here. And the spirit of Abel is here.
[1:07:19] And they're looking to influence you to
[1:07:21] worship. THE SPIRIT OF CAIN DOES NOT
[1:07:23] WANT TO SEE THE MANIFESTATION OF THE
[1:07:26] FAITH THAT WAS ONCE DELIVERED to the
[1:07:28] saints. THE SPIRIT OF CAIN DOES NOT WANT
[1:07:30] TO SEE ANY HOLLERING or any shouting OR
[1:07:33] ANY REJOICING OR ANYBODY JUST GETTING
[1:07:35] CARRIED AWAY IN THE GOOD OLD HOLY GHOST.
[1:07:37] AMEN. THAT'S THE SPIRIT OF CAIN. AMEN.
[1:07:40] [snorts] BUT THERE'S ANOTHER spirit here
[1:07:42] and it's the SPIRIT OF ABEL. AND IT DOES
[1:07:44] NOT WORSHIP BY SCIENCE. IT DOES NOT
[1:07:47] WORSHIP BY BEAUTY. IT DOES NOT WORSHIP
[1:07:49] BY ETHICS. AMEN. BUT THE SPIRIT OF ABEL
[1:07:52] WORSHIP IS BY REVELATION. AND I WANT TO
[1:07:54] TELL EVERY DEVIL IN HELL TONIGHT, THERE
[1:07:56] IS A BRIDE ON THE FACE OF THE EARTH. SHE
[1:07:58] IS NOT MOVED BY EDUCATION. SHE IS NOT
[1:08:01] LED BY SCIENCE. SHE IS NOT EXCITED BY
[1:08:04] ETHICS. BUT WHEN THE REVELATION OF THE
[1:08:06] WORD OF GOD BEGINS TO BREAK INTO HER
[1:08:09] HEART, IT'LL PUT A SHOUT IN HER VOICE.
[1:08:11] IT'LL PUT A SONG IN HER LIPS. HEY, THERE
[1:08:14] IS A people in THESE LAST DAYS WHO ARE
[1:08:16] NOT just contending for the faith, but
[1:08:18] they are witnessing the manifestation of
[1:08:21] the faith that was once delivered to the
[1:08:23] saints. Amen. I'm talking as we as we
[1:08:25] sat there on Sunday. Amen. That this is
[1:08:27] the bride's contention. Amen. I want I
[1:08:30] want to establish something. RE SAID THE
[1:08:32] problem today is the Methodists are
[1:08:34] contending with the Baptist. AND HE SAID
[1:08:36] THE PENTECOSTALS ARE CONTENDING WITH THE
[1:08:38] CATHOLICS. He said, BUT THIS IS NOT
[1:08:40] CONTENDING with each other.
[1:08:42] He said, "This is contending FOR THE
[1:08:45] FAITH." AMEN. I WANT TO REVISIT THAT FOR
[1:08:48] just a second. Amen. Contend don't
[1:08:50] exactly mean to argue. Amen. But contend
[1:08:53] means to debate. IT MEANS TO HOLD FAST
[1:08:56] to your conviction. AND WE FOUND OUT
[1:08:58] THAT THERE'S ONLY ONE FAITH, RIGHT? And
[1:09:00] that was THE FAITH OF GOD WHICH WAS
[1:09:02] RESTORED BY THE MESSENGER OF MALACHI 4.
[1:09:05] AMEN. GOD RESTORED THE BIBLE FAITH.
[1:09:08] AMEN. To the church OF THE LIVING GOD.
[1:09:10] THEN I CAN SAY TODAY WITHOUT ANY
[1:09:12] HUMILIATION. BIBLE DAYS ARE HERE AGAIN.
[1:09:16] AMEN. AMEN. I CAN SHOUT IT FROM THE
[1:09:18] TOPEST FROM THE TOP OF THE MOUNTAINS.
[1:09:20] BIBLE DAYS ARE NOT COMING. BIBLE DAYS
[1:09:22] ARE HERE. YOU SAY, "OH, IF I WAS JUST
[1:09:25] LIVING IN THE DAYS OF THE BIBLE to see
[1:09:27] the overcomers and and to SEE THE POWER
[1:09:29] OF GOD." AMEN. SHAKE YOURSELF TONIGHT
[1:09:32] AND REALIZE YOU ARE LIVING IN THE
[1:09:34] GREATEST HOUR THAT ANYONE HAS EVER LIVED
[1:09:36] IN. IT'S THE HOUR WHEN THE POWER OF GOD
[1:09:39] HAS RETURNED TO THE CHURCH WITH A MIGHTY
[1:09:42] FORCE BEHIND IT TO MANIFEST the word of
[1:09:44] life. Amen. That's why Jude said, "I
[1:09:47] exhort you that you should earnestly
[1:09:49] contend for the faith which was once
[1:09:52] delivered." Somebody shout delivered.
[1:09:55] The faith that was once delivered unto
[1:09:57] the saints. Now, when you look there at
[1:09:59] that word delivered, it means to give
[1:10:01] into the hands of another. So it was in
[1:10:04] one set of hands but it was given into
[1:10:07] another. It means to give over into
[1:10:10] one's power. Amen. Or use. It means to
[1:10:13] deliver to someone. Amen. Something in
[1:10:17] order for them to USE IT. BROTHER BRIAN.
[1:10:19] IT MEANS to deliver VERBALLY BY
[1:10:22] REPORTING. SO WHEN WHEN THE FAITH OF GOD
[1:10:26] BEGINS TO BE DELIVERED, IT'S NOT GOING
[1:10:28] TO BE DONE BY POWERPOINT, FOLKS. IT'S
[1:10:31] NOT GOING TO BE DONE BY CHARTS. AMEN.
[1:10:33] IT'S NOT GOING TO BE DONE BY SOME
[1:10:34] INTELLECTUAL GURU that rose UP OUT OF
[1:10:36] SOMEWHERE THAT'S GOT THE IDEAS ON THE
[1:10:39] BIBLE. NO, THIS IS GOING TO BE A BIBLE
[1:10:41] FAITH AND IT'S GOING TO COME A BIBLE WAY
[1:10:43] AND IT'S ONLY GOING TO INSPIRE, AMEN.
[1:10:46] those who are worshiping by revelation.
[1:10:49] Amen. [laughter] I I I can't talk about
[1:10:51] reporting and not go TO ISAIAH 53. WHO
[1:10:54] HAS believed our report?
[1:10:57] &gt;&gt; AND TO WHOM IS THE arm of the Lord
[1:11:00] revealed? How many knows brother Bam had
[1:11:02] a seventh grade education? Amen. But he
[1:11:05] stood there and taught school in the
[1:11:07] pull PIT LIKE HE WAS A LIKE HE was a
[1:11:08] theologian. HE STOOD THERE AND SAID,
[1:11:10] "NOW LOOK," HE I don't want to say
[1:11:12] taught school. UH HE PREACHED THE BIBLE.
[1:11:15] AMEN. BETTER THAN ANY BOB JONES
[1:11:17] PROFESSOR COULD DO. HE SAID, "NOW YOU
[1:11:19] JUST READ THAT WHO HATH BELIEVED OUR
[1:11:20] REPORT." HE SAID, "THAT'S A QUESTION."
[1:11:22] HE SAID, "NOW WATCH THE LORD answer the
[1:11:25] question with a question." And says,
[1:11:27] "And to whom is the arm of the LORD
[1:11:30] REVEALED?" LISTEN FOLKS, IT TOOK A
[1:11:32] PROPHET TO MAKE THE CONNECTION BETWEEN
[1:11:34] TWO QUESTIONS. HE SAID, "IF YOU HAVE
[1:11:36] BELIEVED OUR REPORT, THEN THE ARM OF THE
[1:11:39] LORD HAS BEEN REVEALED UNTO YOU." THE
[1:11:42] CHURCH WAS LOOKING FOR THE ARM OF THE
[1:11:44] LORD, WHICH IS THE SIGNIFICATION OF THE
[1:11:46] POWER OF GOD. AND THEY WERE MISSING IT.
[1:11:49] BUT A PROPHET STOOD THERE AND SAID, "IF
[1:11:51] YOU CAN BELIEVE THE REPORT, THEN THE
[1:11:53] POWER OF GOD WILL COME AMONG YOU AND
[1:11:55] WILL BEGIN TO RELEASE UNTO you a
[1:11:57] revealing of the word of God in the hour
[1:12:00] you're living in." Amen. He stood there
[1:12:02] and he said, "Now he shall grow up
[1:12:04] before him as a tender plant, as a root
[1:12:07] out of a dry ground. He hath no form nor
[1:12:09] come in us, and when we shall see him,
[1:12:12] there is no beauty we should desire
[1:12:13] him." REBRAHAM STOPS AND SAID, "NOW
[1:12:15] WATCH." AMEN. NOTICE that he [laughter]
[1:12:18] and then this is a person. It's not a
[1:12:20] creed. He is despised and rejected a
[1:12:23] man. HE IS A MAN OF SORROW. HE IS
[1:12:26] ACQUAINTED with grief. We hid as it were
[1:12:28] our faces from him. He was despised and
[1:12:33] we esteemed him not. Surely he hath
[1:12:35] borne our griefs AND CARRIED OUR
[1:12:38] SORROWS. YET WE DID ESTEEM him stricken,
[1:12:41] smitten of God, and afflicted. Ram comes
[1:12:43] along and says, "Now watch. Here's the
[1:12:45] atonement. He was wounded for our
[1:12:47] transgression. HE WAS BRUISED FOR OUR
[1:12:50] INIQUITY. THE CHASTISEMENT OF OUR PEACE
[1:12:52] WAS upon him and with his stripes we are
[1:12:57] healed. COME ON, CHURCH. THAT'S NOT IN
[1:12:59] THE FUTURE. AMEN. THAT'S A PAST TENSE
[1:13:02] HAPPENING. HE SAID, "SEE, ALL WE LIKE
[1:13:04] SHEEP HAVE GONE ASTRAY. We have turned
[1:13:06] everyone to his own way, and the Lord
[1:13:08] have laid upon him the iniquity OF US
[1:13:10] ALL. HE WAS OPPRESSED. HE WAS AFFLICTED.
[1:13:13] YET HE OPENED NOT HIS MOUTH. HE WAS
[1:13:15] BROUGHT AS A LAMB TO THE SLAUGHTER AND
[1:13:17] AS A SHEEP BEFORE THE SHEARS IS DONE. SO
[1:13:20] HE OPENETH NOT HIS MOUTH. HE WAS TAKEN
[1:13:23] from the prison and from judgment. WHO
[1:13:25] SHALL DECLARE HIS GENERATION? HE WAS CUT
[1:13:28] OFF out of the land of the living for
[1:13:31] the transgression of my people. WAS HE
[1:13:34] STRICKEN? AND HE MADE HIS GRAVE WITH THE
[1:13:37] WICKED AND WITH THE rich in his death
[1:13:40] because he had done no violence. Amen.
[1:13:42] Now neither was any deceit IN HIS MOUTH.
[1:13:45] AMEN. NOW COME ON CHURCH. THIS IS MORE
[1:13:48] AMEN THAN A BOOK REPORT. This is more
[1:13:50] THAN A LECTURE. BROTHER SAID JESUS we
[1:13:53] have no record where he went to school.
[1:13:55] He was just an ordinary man. HE TALKED
[1:13:57] WHERE THE COMMON PEOPLE could understand
[1:13:59] him. He said so THERE WAS NOTHING
[1:14:02] OUTSTANDING ABOUT his looks and so forth
[1:14:05] that you could MAKE HIM WHAT HE WAS. SO
[1:14:08] IN OTHER WORDS, WHEN YOU LOOKED AT HIM,
[1:14:10] YOU COULD NOT IDENTIFY HIM BY THE WAY HE
[1:14:12] LOOKED WITH THE POWERFUL PROPHECIES THAT
[1:14:14] WAS CONCERNING THE MESSIAH. HE SAID WHAT
[1:14:17] HE WAS IS NOT BY OUTWARD APPEARANCE. FOR
[1:14:20] HE WAS A MAN OUTWARD, BUT ON THE INSIDE
[1:14:23] HE WAS GOD WHICH WAS EMMANUEL THE FATHER
[1:14:26] GOD WAS IN HIM RECONCILING THE WORLD TO
[1:14:29] HIMSELF. HE SAID SO THERE HE brought the
[1:14:32] Christian faith. old church. They were
[1:14:35] looking for faith and missing where the
[1:14:36] faith was at.
[1:14:39] &gt;&gt; WE GOT TO GO DOWN HERE TO THE RABBIS. WE
[1:14:40] WE GOT TO GO DOWN HERE TO THE
[1:14:42] SEMINARIES. WE WE GOT TO GO OVER HERE TO
[1:14:43] THE SCRIBES, THE PHARISEES. AMEN. WHERE
[1:14:45] CAN WE FIND THE FAITH? AND THERE WAS THE
[1:14:47] FAITH OF ALMIGHTY GOD VEILED BEHIND THE
[1:14:50] FLESH OF THE VIRGIN BORN SON OF GOD. OH
[1:14:53] CHURCH, he said, "WHAT DID JESUS DO? HE
[1:14:56] BROUGHT GOD TO HUMAN LIVES." BROTHER
[1:14:58] JOE, GOD WAS MADE HUMAN WHEN JESUS was
[1:15:02] born. HE SAYS GOD BECAME MAN THAT HE
[1:15:05] MIGHT BECOME FELLOWSHIP with man and in
[1:15:08] man. Now not with man ONLY BUT IN MAN.
[1:15:12] NOW WHY WAS HE TRYING TO GET IN MAN to
[1:15:15] achieve ONE PURPOSE THAT IS TO BRING MAN
[1:15:18] TO BRING TO MAN WHAT GOD IS. AMEN. NOT
[1:15:21] WHAT A CHURCH IS BUT WHAT GOD IS. SO
[1:15:25] JESUS CAME THAT HE MIGHT PRESENT GOD TO
[1:15:28] MAN AND man didn't want it. Amen. I'LL
[1:15:31] SAY IT LIKE THIS. AMEN. NOW, I I WANT
[1:15:33] YOU TO HEAR THIS, OKAY? CUZ THEY WERE
[1:15:35] TRYING TO FIND SOMETHING THAT WOULD
[1:15:37] BRING THEM DELIVERANCE. THEY WERE TRYING
[1:15:39] TO FIND SOMETHING THAT WOULD CHANGE
[1:15:41] THEIR LIVES. And I want to say this to
[1:15:43] you. ONLY THE FAITH THAT was once
[1:15:46] delivered to the saints has the power to
[1:15:49] deliver you. ONLY THE FAITH THAT WAS
[1:15:52] DELIVERED, AMEN. NOT BY THE RABBI. AMEN.
[1:15:56] NOT BY THE S BY THE SCRIBE. AMEN. BUT BY
[1:15:59] GOD MANIFESTED IN THE FLESH OF JESUS IS
[1:16:02] THE only thing that has the power TO
[1:16:04] DELIVER. REMEMBER SAID THAT LITTLE WORD
[1:16:06] FAITH, IT GETS IT GETS mixed up a lot of
[1:16:08] times with the word hope. He said
[1:16:10] they're just as different as day is from
[1:16:12] night. He said faith is the substance
[1:16:15] and hope is what you're hoping for. Now
[1:16:18] listen WHAT HE SAYS. HE SAYS FAITH
[1:16:20] DELIVERS. AMEN. There is a direct
[1:16:22] connection between deliverance and
[1:16:24] faith.
[1:16:26] IN 1951, HE SAID, "AS SOON AS REAL
[1:16:29] GENUINE CHRISTIAN FAITH EVER ANCHORS
[1:16:32] INTO A PERSON'S HEART, LET THEM BE BOUND
[1:16:34] IN A WHEELCHAIR, LET THEM be blind," or
[1:16:36] whatever it is. He says, "They'll tell
[1:16:38] it." THAT'S RIGHT. THEY'LL SCREAM OUT,
[1:16:40] "I AM HEALED." THEY'LL SAY, "HOW DO YOU
[1:16:43] KNOW YOU ARE?" YOU'LL SAY, "JESUS SAID
[1:16:45] SO AND I BELIEVE IT." HE SAID, "SEE,
[1:16:48] THEN THAT IS THE FUNDAMENTAL FOUNDATION
[1:16:50] OF OUR CHRISTIAN FAITH IS THAT Jesus
[1:16:54] Christ lives today. Oh church, THE
[1:16:57] FUNDAMENTAL FOUNDATION of what we
[1:16:59] BELIEVE IS BUILT UPON THE PRINCIPLE OUR
[1:17:02] GOD IS NOT DEAD. HE IS NOT IN A TOMB in
[1:17:06] Jerusalem. He is not IN A GRAVE IN
[1:17:08] JEFFERSONVILLE. HE IS NOT IN A MUSEUM IN
[1:17:11] JEFFERSONVILLE. HE IS NOT IN THE
[1:17:13] MOUNTAINS OF ARIZONA. HE IS RIGHT HERE
[1:17:15] TONIGHT JUST ALIVE AND WELL TONIGHT AS
[1:17:18] HE WAS 2,000 YEARS AGO. BECAUSE THIS IS
[1:17:22] NOT A CHURCH FAITH. It's a living faith.
[1:17:25] Amen. When something is delivered to
[1:17:27] you, IT IS COMING FROM A SOURCE. SAID,
[1:17:30] "WATCH, VERILY, I SAY UNTO YOU, the son
[1:17:32] can do nothing in himself, BUT WHAT HE
[1:17:34] SEES THE FATHER DOING." REB COME ALONG
[1:17:36] and said, "See, we're contending for the
[1:17:38] faith that was once delivered. It had to
[1:17:40] come from somewhere if it was delivered
[1:17:43] to the saints. Is that right? He said,
[1:17:46] "The faith that was once delivered unto
[1:17:48] the saints, WHO DELIVERED IT?" NOW, COME
[1:17:51] ON. IF I MAKE A DELIVERY TO YOUR HOUSE,
[1:17:53] THAT'S ONE THING. If brother MATT COMES
[1:17:55] BY YOUR HOUSE, THAT'S ANOTHER THING.
[1:17:57] AMEN. IF YOUR BUDDY COMES BY, THAT'S
[1:17:59] ANOTHER THING. He said, "Who delivered
[1:18:01] it?" Amen. a little while and the world
[1:18:03] see me no more. But ye SHALL SEE ME, FOR
[1:18:06] I will be with you, even in you to the
[1:18:08] end OF THE WORLD. AND THE THINGS that I
[1:18:10] do SHALL YOU DO ALSO, EVEN MORE THAN
[1:18:13] THIS. FOR I GO UNTO MY FATHER. HE SAID,
[1:18:16] DO YOU GET IT? HE SAYS, the faith he
[1:18:19] represented, he delivered. Well, that
[1:18:21] ought to make YOU PUT YOUR SHOUTING
[1:18:23] SHOES ON. AMEN. THE FAITH he delivered,
[1:18:26] he represented, he delivered to the
[1:18:28] church. AMEN. TO TAKE IT TO THE ENDS OF
[1:18:32] THE WORLD. OH CHURCH, AMEN. GOD SENT YOU
[1:18:35] A PACKAGE IN THE LAST DAYS WITH THE
[1:18:38] FAITH OF GOD ON THE INSIDE of it that it
[1:18:41] would bring ABOUT A MANIFESTATION OF THE
[1:18:44] POWER of God in YOUR LIFE. NOW, I GOT A
[1:18:46] BIG QUESTION FOR YOU, OKAY? HOW DOES GOD
[1:18:49] deliver something or bring something to
[1:18:51] you?
[1:18:53] &gt;&gt; Amen. GOD DON'T HAVE NO AMAZON TRUCKS OF
[1:18:55] FOLKS RUNNING up and down the ROAD ALL
[1:18:57] DAY. HE DON'T USE UPS. HE DON'T USE
[1:19:01] FEDEX. COME ON. HE HE HE DON'T USE YOU,
[1:19:04] THE POSTAL SERVICE. HOW DOES GOD GET
[1:19:07] SOMETHING TO YOU? WELL, IF YOU GO TO
[1:19:09] ROMANS 10, HOW SHALL THEY CALL ON HIM
[1:19:11] AND WHOM THEY HAVE NOT HEARD or
[1:19:13] believed? AND HOW SHALL THEY BELIEVE IN
[1:19:15] HIM OF WHOM THEY HAVE NOT HEARD? AND HOW
[1:19:17] SHALL THEY HEAR WITHOUT A PREACHER? AND
[1:19:20] HOW SHALL THEY PREACH EXCEPT THEY BE
[1:19:22] SENT? AS HE HAS WRITTEN, "HOW BEAUTIFUL
[1:19:24] are the feet of them that preach the
[1:19:26] gospel of peace AND BRING GLAD TIDINGS
[1:19:28] OF GOOD THINGS, BUT THEY HAVE NOT ALL
[1:19:30] OBEYED THE GOSPEL." ALL THE WAY IN THE
[1:19:32] BOOK OF ROMANS, PAUL IS STILL PULLING.
[1:19:35] AMEN. FROM ISAIAH 53 AND SAID, ISAIAH
[1:19:38] SAITH, LORD, WHO HATH BELIEVED OUR
[1:19:40] REPORT? AMEN. SO THEN FAITH COMETH BY
[1:19:43] HEARING AND HEARING BY THE WORD OF GOD.
[1:19:47] REMEMBER SAID GOD CANNOT MAKE anyone
[1:19:49] believe. GOD CAN ONLY REVEAL HIMSELF IN
[1:19:52] DIFFERENT FORMS. HE HAS REVEALED HIMSELF
[1:19:54] IN THE WIND, in mysterious movements, IN
[1:19:57] THE FORM OF ANGELS. AND HE HAS REVEALED
[1:20:00] HIMSELF IN MAN BY THE PREACHING OF THE
[1:20:03] GOSPEL. COME ON. [laughter] I I JUST
[1:20:05] MIGHT AS WELL TAKE THE GLOVES OFF AND
[1:20:06] PREACH. AMEN. I DON'T THINK WE OUGHT TO
[1:20:08] GO INTO ANOTHER YEAR. AMEN. WITH A
[1:20:10] NEGATIVE ATTITUDE TOWARDS THE MINISTRY.
[1:20:12] AMEN. I DON'T KNOW WHERE THAT COME FROM.
[1:20:14] I'M JUST PREACHING. AMEN. AMEN. THEY'RE
[1:20:16] JUST THE MAILMAN. AMEN. BUT THEY'RE
[1:20:18] DELIVERING WHAT GOD IS SENDING UNTO YOUR
[1:20:21] ADDRESS.
[1:20:23] &gt;&gt; AMEN. NOW WATCH A PROPHET. HE SAID,
[1:20:24] "THAT'S A THING TONIGHT. QUIT ARGUING
[1:20:26] RELIGIONS AND DIFFERENT PHASES AND ARGUE
[1:20:28] ABOUT DIFFERENT CHURCH DENOMINATION.
[1:20:30] ARGUE ABOUT DIFFERENT NATION." AMEN. NO.
[1:20:32] What the world needs tonight IS TO KNOW
[1:20:34] THAT JESUS HAS RISEN from the dead and
[1:20:36] HE LIVES AMONG MEN. NOT ARGUE about
[1:20:38] pinpoint this and cut this and move this
[1:20:41] and THIS AND SPIRE. JUST FORGET IT and
[1:20:43] look unto him and believe HE RAISED FROM
[1:20:46] THE DEAD AND he will manifest himself to
[1:20:49] you. IT'S JUST THAT SIMPLE. YOU SAY,
[1:20:52] "WELL, IF AN ANGEL WAS PREACHING THAT."
[1:20:54] AMEN. That's what people say. IF AN
[1:20:56] ANGEL WAS PREACHING THAT, THEN I WOULD
[1:20:58] RECEIVE IT. BUT A PROPHET SAID GOD
[1:21:01] DIDN'T ORDAIN ANGELS TO PREACH THE
[1:21:02] GOSPEL. HE ORDAINED MEN TO PREACH THE
[1:21:06] GOSPEL. HE NEVER SAID TO THE ANGELS,
[1:21:08] "I'LL BE WITH YOU AND IN YOU." HE SAID
[1:21:11] TO MEN, "I'LL BE WITH YOU AND IN YOU."
[1:21:13] HE NEVER SAID TO ANGELS, "THE THINGS
[1:21:15] THAT I DO SHALL YOU DO ALSO." HE SAID TO
[1:21:18] MEN, "THE THINGS I DO, YOU SHALL DO
[1:21:21] ALSO." SO THE GOSPEL COMES BY PREACHING
[1:21:24] OF THE WORD OF GOD. AND IT'S MANIFEST
[1:21:27] HIMSELF THROUGH HUMAN BEINGS. MY THE PRO
[1:21:30] GOD SAID, "BRINGING SINNERS TO
[1:21:31] REPENTANCE." AMEN. BY THE PREACHING OF
[1:21:34] THE WORD. AMEN. AMEN. I'm just going to
[1:21:36] go AHEAD AND SAY IT. I THINK THAT OUGHT
[1:21:37] TO BE THE MOST EXCITING PART OF THE
[1:21:38] SERVICE IS THE PREACHING OF THE WORD. I
[1:21:42] THINK THAT OUGHT TO BE THE THE PART OF
[1:21:43] THE SERVICE THAT WE CAN'T WAIT FOR.
[1:21:45] AMEN. AMEN. IT DON'T MATTER WHO'S
[1:21:47] PREACHING. IT DON'T MATTER HOW BIG, HOW
[1:21:49] SMALL, HOW TALL, HOW SHORT, HOW
[1:21:51] EDUCATED, HOW UNEDUCATED. I JUST WANT TO
[1:21:54] HEAR WHAT GOD HAS DELIVERED UNTO THIS
[1:21:57] GENERATION.
[1:21:59] And then I just say what a prophet said.
[1:22:01] He said by the preaching of the word and
[1:22:03] the demonstration of the Holy Spirit,
[1:22:04] they become submissive to the word of
[1:22:06] God. AMEN. THAT'S WHY THE DEVIL wants to
[1:22:09] control
[1:22:10] YOUR ATTITUDE TOWARDS THE PREACHING OF
[1:22:12] THIS GOSPEL IS BECAUSE BY THE PREACHING
[1:22:15] THIS GOSPEL, IT IS THE DESTROYING OR THE
[1:22:18] MORTIFYING OF YOUR FLESH. AMEN. THAT
[1:22:21] YOUR LIFE MIGHT COME SUBJECT TO THE WORD
[1:22:23] OF GOD. NOW, AMEN. I JUST WANT TO
[1:22:25] INTERCEPT this here. THAT'S THE WAY IT
[1:22:27] IS IN THE PREACH OF THE GOSPEL. IT'S NOT
[1:22:29] WE ourselves
[1:22:32] &gt;&gt; as ministers. We are not THE GOSPEL.
[1:22:36] NOW, THERE'S A ROOM FULL of preachers
[1:22:37] HERE TONIGHT. AND NOT A ONE OF THEM IS
[1:22:39] THE GOSPEL,
[1:22:40] &gt;&gt; BUT WE ARE ONLY TRANSMITTERS THAT
[1:22:43] TRANSMITS THE VOICE OF GOD THROUGH OUR
[1:22:46] agency of men to the hearer. Reverend
[1:22:49] said, "Now listen ON THE PLATFORM WHEN
[1:22:51] THE HOLY Spirit is speaking and he's
[1:22:54] speaking through mortal lips, he always
[1:22:56] does." He says, "I believe these are
[1:22:58] ministers behind me." And brethren, you
[1:23:01] never preached a sermon in your life.
[1:23:04] &gt;&gt; Woo! You talk about humbling yourself.
[1:23:07] YOU NEVER PREACHED A SERMON IN YOUR
[1:23:09] LIFE. THE HOLY SPIRIT preached through
[1:23:11] you a sermon. Amen. That's right. SEE,
[1:23:14] WE DON'T PREACH. THE HOLY SPIRIT DOES
[1:23:17] THE SPEAKING. OH, WE MIGHT WRITE OUT
[1:23:19] SOMETHING AND READ IT. BUT THAT ISN'T
[1:23:21] PREACHING. HE SAID, "PREACHING is when
[1:23:24] inspiration comes AND IT'S PREACHED BY
[1:23:27] INSPIRATION AND THE HOLY SPIRIT GIVES
[1:23:30] THE UNCCTION." COME ON, FOLKS. NO MATTER
[1:23:32] HOW BURDENED I AM IN MY HEART, AMEN, TO
[1:23:34] DELIVER SOMETHING, UNLESS THE HOLY GHOST
[1:23:37] WILL COME BEHIND WHAT'S BEING SAID AND
[1:23:39] QUICKEN SOMETHING IN YOUR HEART, IT'LL
[1:23:41] BE JUST ANOTHER SERMON. OH, BUT YOU WANT
[1:23:44] TO SEE A MANIFESTATION OF THE FAITH THAT
[1:23:46] WAS ONCE DELIVERED TO THE SAINTS. LET
[1:23:48] the word BEGIN TO BE PREACHED AND LET
[1:23:50] SINNERS COME TO REPENTANCE AND LET
[1:23:52] PEOPLE SAY, "I'M SORRY AND I'M WRONG."
[1:23:55] LISTEN, THAT'S MORE THAN JUST A GOOD
[1:23:57] SERMON. THAT'S THE UNCCTION OF THE HOLY
[1:23:59] GHOST BRINGING YOU IN LINE WITH THE WORD
[1:24:02] OF GOD. COME ON. THERE'S A RAPTURE
[1:24:04] COMING. THERE'S A RESURRECTION COMING.
[1:24:06] THERE'S A BODY CHANGE COMING. AND
[1:24:08] THERE'S ONLY ONE WAY WE'RE GOING TO GET
[1:24:09] THERE. IT'S BY THE WORD OF ALMIGHTY GOD.
[1:24:14] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH.
[1:24:16] &gt;&gt; We can read something that don't matter.
[1:24:18] But when the HOLY SPIRIT GETS A HOLD of
[1:24:20] it and takes it out to the people, THEN
[1:24:23] SOMETHING TAKES A HOLD. NOW, I LOVE
[1:24:25] THIS. HE SAID, "HOW DID HE BRING CHRIST
[1:24:27] HERE?" WHO IS CHRIST? The anointing,
[1:24:29] right?
[1:24:30] &gt;&gt; The anointed word. Now, HOW DID HE BRING
[1:24:33] CHRIST HERE? BY THE WORD OF THE
[1:24:35] PROPHETS. HOW WILL HE BRING HIS BRIDE
[1:24:38] HERE? BY THE word of the prophets. THEN
[1:24:43] JESUS PROMISED, LISTEN, THE BODY of
[1:24:46] believers would do the same works that
[1:24:49] he did. And when he left the earth, NOW
[1:24:52] LISTEN, HE LEFT THE outline
[1:24:55] or THE SHAPE THE BODY OF CHRIST SHOULD
[1:24:58] BE IN.
[1:25:00] &gt;&gt; SO WE'RE NO LONGER HAVE TO WONDER WHAT
[1:25:02] WE SHOULD LOOK LIKE.
[1:25:05] &gt;&gt; We no longer HAVE TO WONDER WHAT AN AXE
[1:25:08] CHURCH LOOKS LIKE. WE have received a
[1:25:11] blueprint. Amen. I I love brother Billy
[1:25:14] PAUL'S TESTIMONY. HE TELLS IT LIKE THIS.
[1:25:16] HE SAID YEARS AGO WHEN THEY STARTED
[1:25:18] BUILDING THE DEN there in Arizona, HE
[1:25:20] SAID SOMEBODY COME BY AND THEY AND THEY
[1:25:22] TOLD THE MAN THAT was building it said
[1:25:23] they'll do this and do that. And brother
[1:25:25] Billy Paul said this. He said before the
[1:25:27] man started, he said, "Brother Brandon
[1:25:29] went to him and he said, "Now buddy," he
[1:25:31] said, "there's going to be a lot of
[1:25:32] people come by and they're going to tell
[1:25:34] you to change this and add that and do
[1:25:37] this this way and do that this way." He
[1:25:39] said, "Just nod and grinned and say
[1:25:42] THANK YOU AND STAY WITH THE BLUEPRINT."
[1:25:45] OH, I thought, man, that's more than
[1:25:47] just good A GOOD TESTIMONY. AMEN. I I I
[1:25:50] don't know about you, BUT BROTHER MATT,
[1:25:51] I WANT TO USE THAT ON THE FIELD. AMEN.
[1:25:53] AMEN. I'VE BEEN PREACHING SINCE I WAS A
[1:25:55] KID AND I'VE HAD PEOPLE SAY, "Preach it
[1:25:57] this way and do it that way and DO IT
[1:25:58] THIS WAY." AMEN. BUT LORD, JUST HELP ME
[1:26:00] TO SMILE AND NOD AND GRIN AND SAY,
[1:26:03] "THANK YOU. BUT AT THE END OF THE DAY,
[1:26:05] I'M GOING TO STAY WITH THE BLUEPRINT
[1:26:08] BECAUSE THE BLUEPRINT HAS GOT TO MATCH
[1:26:10] WHAT GOD LEFT FOR HIS CHURCH TO BE.
[1:26:13] &gt;&gt; I'LL BE WITH YOU IN YOU DOING THE SAME
[1:26:15] THINGS I DID WHILE I WAS HERE in this
[1:26:18] body." Now listen at THIS. HE SAYS, "I
[1:26:20] WILL BE BACK IN MY MYSTICAL BODY DOING
[1:26:24] THE same thing."
[1:26:26] &gt;&gt; CHURCH OF THE LIVING GOD, I WILL BE BACK
[1:26:29] IN MY MYSTICAL BODY DOING THE SAME
[1:26:32] THINGS IN THE MYSTICAL BODY THAT I DID
[1:26:36] IN THE CORPORAL BODY. OH, the only thing
[1:26:38] his death was at CALVARY WAS TO SAVE a
[1:26:41] sinner and to produce to the church the
[1:26:44] power or the authority. He said, "Now
[1:26:46] listen, the faith that was once
[1:26:48] delivered to the saints, here it is.
[1:26:50] What was it? IT WAS THE SPIRIT OF Christ
[1:26:54] in THE APOSTLE." I I want I want you TO
[1:26:57] CATCH THIS BECAUSE THERE'S NOT A
[1:26:59] CONTRADICTION between contending for the
[1:27:02] faith AND APPROPRIATING THE FAITH.
[1:27:05] ACTUALLY, THEY GO TOGETHER. WHAT'S
[1:27:06] ACTUALLY HAPPENING IS is one is
[1:27:09] defending the truth and the other IS
[1:27:12] LIVING THE TRUTH.
[1:27:14] NOW, NOW I WANT YOU TO CATCH THIS
[1:27:16] BECAUSE THE WHOLE OBJECTIVE HERE IS THE
[1:27:19] FAITH. SOMEBODY SAY THAT WITH ME, THE
[1:27:20] FAITH. THE WHOLE OBJECTIVE IS THE FAITH.
[1:27:24] NOW, AMEN. WHAT'S HAPPENING IS THERE IS
[1:27:27] A DEFENSE OF THE TRUTH FROM ERROR. THERE
[1:27:30] IS A STANDING AGAINST FALSE DOCTRINE.
[1:27:33] THERE IS A PRESERVING OF THE ORIGINAL
[1:27:35] WORD. AND THERE IS A MAINTAINING THE
[1:27:38] PURITY OF THE MESSAGE. NOW LOOK WHAT
[1:27:41] JESUS SAID. HE SAID, "WHATSOEVER THINGS
[1:27:43] YOU DESIRE WHEN YOU PRAY." NOW, WATCH
[1:27:46] THIS. BELIEVE THAT YOU receive
[1:27:49] them AND YE SHALL HAVE THEM. LOOK AT
[1:27:51] THIS WORD RECEIVE. TO TAKE A HOLD OF IN
[1:27:54] ORDER TO USE. Look here. It means to
[1:27:57] claim for oneself. It means to
[1:28:01] appropriate TO ONESELF. AMEN. I WANT YOU
[1:28:04] TO CATCH THIS BECAUSE THAT LITTLE WORD
[1:28:06] APPROPRIATE has two powerful different
[1:28:09] meanings. [laughter] Amen. I'm not I'm
[1:28:11] not a I'm not a English major, but I
[1:28:13] I'll I'll pretend like it. Uh the first
[1:28:16] meaning OF APPROPRIATE IS AN ADJECTIVE.
[1:28:20] &gt;&gt; I thought that's pretty good.
[1:28:23] WHICH IS A DESCRIPTION, RIGHT? SO IT
[1:28:26] MEANS IT'S SOMETHING suitable or proper
[1:28:30] in the circumstances. Now I want TO SAY
[1:28:32] THIS, GOD IS AN APPROPRIATE GOD.
[1:28:36] &gt;&gt; AMEN. anything he does or anything HE
[1:28:39] HAS IS APPROPRIATE. I'LL SAY THIS, GOD
[1:28:42] HAS AN APPROPRIATE TIME. GOD HAS AN
[1:28:46] APPROPRIATE PLACE. GOD HAS AN
[1:28:49] APPROPRIATE WAY. LOOK HERE IN THE DAYS
[1:28:51] OF NOAH WHEN THE WORLD WAS UNDER THE
[1:28:53] ANDALIAN DESTRUCTION. YOU KNOW WHAT THE
[1:28:55] BIBLE SAYS? THERE WAS ONLY EIGHT PEOPLE
[1:28:57] IN THAT DAY that overcame.
[1:29:00] &gt;&gt; BROTHER BAM COMES ALONG AND SAYS THERE
[1:29:02] WAS EIGHT OVERCOME. He said, "Now they
[1:29:04] entered the ark AT THE APPROPRIATE
[1:29:07] TIME." HOW DID THEY DO IT? THEY LISTENED
[1:29:10] TO THE WORD OF GOD. COME ON. WHAT NOAH
[1:29:13] WAS DELIVERING VERBALLY, THEY WERE
[1:29:15] HEARING IT AND THEY WERE BELIEVING IT
[1:29:18] AND IT WAS PUTTING THEM IN THE ARK OF
[1:29:20] SAFETY. AMEN. YOU LOOK AT JOHN CHAPTER
[1:29:22] 11. I'm just just using a few examples
[1:29:24] here. IN JOHN CHAPTER 11, LAZARUS DIES.
[1:29:27] YOU KNOW WHAT THE PROPHET SAID? HE SAID
[1:29:29] JESUS MADE THE QUOTATION. HE DIDN'T DO
[1:29:31] ONE THING EXCEPT THE FATHER showed him
[1:29:34] in a vision. HE SAID, "NOW he knew
[1:29:36] Lazarus was sick AND HE KNEW HE WAS
[1:29:38] DYING AND HE STILL WENT AWAY." HE SAID,
[1:29:41] "NOW WATCH." BUT THAT LOVELY LORD JESUS
[1:29:44] INSTEAD OF RETURNING BACK, YOU KNOW WHAT
[1:29:46] HE DID? HE WENT ON A LITTLE FURTHER AND
[1:29:49] HE JUST IGNORED HIM. AND THEY SIN AGAIN
[1:29:51] AND HE STILL WOULDN'T GO BECAUSE HE
[1:29:54] WAITED TILL THE APPROPRIATE TIME THAT HE
[1:29:57] KNOW THE FATHER HAD TOLD HIM WHAT WAS
[1:30:00] GOING TO HAPPEN.
[1:30:01] &gt;&gt; WELL, GLORY TO GOD. SO, THE APPROPRIATE
[1:30:04] TIME WASN'T WHEN HE GOT THE FIRST EMAIL.
[1:30:07] &gt;&gt; And then I'm I'm preaching a little bit
[1:30:09] here. THE APPROPRIATE TIME WAS NOT WHEN
[1:30:11] HE GOT THE FIRST TEXT MESSAGE, BUT THE
[1:30:14] APPROPRIATE TIME WAS WHEN THE FATHER BY
[1:30:16] VISION HAD SHOWED HIM THAT THERE WOULD
[1:30:19] BE A RESURRECTION. AMEN. [laughter] I I
[1:30:21] I'M JUST GOING TO BRING IT ALL THE WAY
[1:30:22] BACK TO THE OLD TESTAMENT. OKAY? In 2
[1:30:24] Kings chapter 4, there was the
[1:30:26] Shounamite woman and the Bible says that
[1:30:28] she built a room onto her house. SHE DID
[1:30:32] A FAVOR, AMEN, FOR THE PROPHET. SHE
[1:30:35] BUILT A ROOM ON THEIR HOUSE AND THE
[1:30:37] WOMAN WAS HONORING GOD AND SHE HONORED
[1:30:39] THIS PROPHET AND SHE SEEN GOD AND THE
[1:30:41] PROPHET AND SHE WANTED NOTHING FOR IT.
[1:30:43] BUT THAT PROPHET WANTED TO BLESS HER AND
[1:30:46] HE SAID, "WHAT DO YOU WANT?" AND YOU
[1:30:47] KNOW WHAT SHE SAID? SHE SAID, "I DON'T
[1:30:49] LACK FOR ANYTHING." HE SAID, "WELL, YOU
[1:30:51] DON'T HAVE ANY CHILDREN." NO MORE THAN
[1:30:53] GAHESA SAW HIM. NO DOUBT THE PROPHET SAW
[1:30:55] A VISION AND HE SAID, "THUS SAYAITH THE
[1:30:57] LORD, GO TELL HER IN THE APPROPRIATE
[1:31:00] TIME OR IN THE APPROPRIATE TIME OR THE
[1:31:04] APPROPRIATE TIME A YEAR FROM NOW SHE'LL
[1:31:07] EMBRACE A SON." ABOUT 12 YEARS OLD, THAT
[1:31:10] BOY WAS OUT IN THE FIELD WORKING WITH
[1:31:11] HIS FATHER AND HE FELL SICK OF A OF A OF
[1:31:14] A SUNSTROKE. AND THE PRO OF GOD SAID
[1:31:16] THEY TOOK THE BOY IN THERE AND HE SAID,
[1:31:18] "NOW LOOK WHAT THEY DONE." HE SAID, "THE
[1:31:20] WOMAN GOT DESPERATE. SO SHE TOOK THAT
[1:31:23] BOY and she laid him IN THE BED OF THAT
[1:31:27] PROPHET. OH, CHURCH OF THE LIVING GOD. I
[1:31:29] LOVE WHAT A PROPHET SAID. HE SAID, "AND
[1:31:31] THE WOMAN DONE THE MOST APPROPRIATE
[1:31:34] THING THAT COULD BE DONE, THE MOST
[1:31:37] PROPER THING THAT COULD BE DONE IN THE
[1:31:40] FACE OF THOSE CIRCUMSTANCES WAS TO LAY
[1:31:43] THAT LIFELESS body
[1:31:46] in a PLACE WHERE A PROPHET HAD LAID." HE
[1:31:48] SAID, "NOW WATCH THAT PROPHET IN
[1:31:50] DESPERATION." HE SAID THAT PROPHET SAID,
[1:31:52] "LAY MY STAFF UPON THE CHILD." He said,
[1:31:54] "But then all of A SUDDEN HE WENT IN
[1:31:56] THERE AND LAID HIS BODY ON TOP OF THAT
[1:31:58] DEAD BABY." AND HE BEGAN TO BREATHE INTO
[1:32:01] HIM. And he said, "THE BABY SNEEZED AND
[1:32:03] LIFE COME BACK IN THERE." HE SAID, "NOW
[1:32:05] WHAT HAPPENED?" HE SAID, "THE BABY COME
[1:32:08] TO LIFE." BECAUSE THAT DESPERATION, ARE
[1:32:11] YOU HEARING ME? THAT DESPERATION,
[1:32:13] [snorts]
[1:32:14] IT DROVE THE WOMAN TO THE PROPHET. AND
[1:32:16] THE DESPERATION DROVE THE PROPHET TO THE
[1:32:19] BABY. AND DESPERATION IN BOTH OF THEM
[1:32:22] DRAWED GOD ON THE SCENE WITH THE LOVE OF
[1:32:25] GOD. AND FOR his people, IT BROUGHT THE
[1:32:28] LOVE OF GOD DOWN AND THROWED FAITH OUT
[1:32:31] ON THE BATTLEFRONT AND THE WORK WAS
[1:32:34] DONE. COME ON, CHURCH. HOW MANY DAYS DID
[1:32:37] SHE HAVE TO CONTEND WITH CRITICS
[1:32:40] LAUGHING AT HER FOR BUILDING THAT LITTLE
[1:32:42] ELIJAH ROOM? HOW MANY DAYS DID PEOPLE
[1:32:45] SAY YOU WASTED YOUR TIME AND YOU'LL
[1:32:47] NEVER RECEIVE ANYTHING FOR IT? OH, BUT
[1:32:49] WHEN THAT BABY DIED, HALLELUJAH, WHEN
[1:32:52] THAT BABY DIED, THE ROOM SHE HAD MADE IN
[1:32:56] HER HOUSE FOR THE PROPHET OF GOD, IT
[1:32:58] BROUGHT THE FAITH OF GOD ON THE
[1:33:00] BATTLEFRONT IN THE MIDST OF THE BATTLE
[1:33:02] AND BROUGHT THAT DEAD BABY TO LIFE. OH,
[1:33:05] HEAR ME AND HEAR ME WELL. YOU WILL NEVER
[1:33:08] MAKE TOO MUCH ROOM IN YOUR HOUSE FOR A
[1:33:10] PROPHET'S MESSAGE.
[1:33:13] YOU WILL NEVER MAKE TOO MUCH ROOM FOR A
[1:33:15] PROPHET'S MESSAGE IN YOUR HOME. WHEN
[1:33:17] YOUR BABIES ARE SICK, LISTEN, YOU DON'T
[1:33:19] HAVE TO LAY THEM IN BROTHER BRANDHAM'S
[1:33:21] BED. YOU DON'T HAVE TO LAY THEM IN A
[1:33:22] PROPHET'S ARMS, BUT THERE'S AN
[1:33:24] INSPIRATION THERE. COME ON. I'M WRITING
[1:33:26] THE MESSAGE. HE SAID, "AND WHEN I'M
[1:33:28] MILES AWAY, THE SAME FAITH WILL BE RIGHT
[1:33:32] THERE WITH YOU."
[1:33:34] &gt;&gt; GLORY TO GOD. WELL, BROTHER MATT, IF HE
[1:33:36] WAS A THOUSAND MILES, THAT'S ONE THING.
[1:33:38] BUT TONIGHT, HE'S IN ANOTHER DIMENSION.
[1:33:40] WELL, THAT'S OKAY. WE'RE NOT WORSHIPING
[1:33:43] WILLIAM BRANDON. WE'RE NOT A CULT. WE'RE
[1:33:45] NOT A BUNCH OF FANATICS. WE'RE
[1:33:47] CHRISTIANS. WE GOT A BIBLE FAITH AND A
[1:33:49] BIBLE GOD AND A BIBLE HOLY GHOST.
[1:33:54] WILLIAM BRANDON MAY NOT BE HERE TONIGHT,
[1:33:56] BUT THE FAITH HE BROUGHT IS RIGHT HERE
[1:33:59] IN THIS BUILDING TONIGHT. AND YOU CAN
[1:34:01] APPROPRIATE IT OVER ANY SITUATION IN
[1:34:04] YOUR FAMILY, IN YOUR BODY.
[1:34:09] I'M NOT TALKING ABOUT SOME SOME HOODOO
[1:34:11] OR SOME SOME SOME MAGIC WORD. I'M
[1:34:13] TALKING ABOUT A REALITY.
[1:34:16] &gt;&gt; This ain't a bunch of powder. [laughter]
[1:34:19] &gt;&gt; Come on. I'm sorry. I I DON'T I DON'T
[1:34:21] MEAN I TOLD YOU, brother Matt, it might
[1:34:23] get dangerous.
[1:34:25] &gt;&gt; He said I He said, "I've never heard you
[1:34:27] preach in your home church." I said,
[1:34:28] "That could be dangerous."
[1:34:30] I said, "When you're at home amongst
[1:34:32] home folks who love the message, you
[1:34:33] just preach."
[1:34:35] &gt;&gt; ARE ARE YOU HEARING ME? AMEN. I KNOW
[1:34:37] PEOPLE MADE THIS UH THEY THEY THEY'VE
[1:34:39] ALMOST MADE THINGS HYPOCRITICAL. AND I
[1:34:42] DON'T MEAN THAT NEGATIVE, BUT I THANK
[1:34:44] GOD FOR EVERY ARTIFACT OF BROTHER
[1:34:45] BRANDHAMS. I THANK GOD FOR EVERY PRAYER
[1:34:47] CLOTH. I THANK GOD FOR EVERY HAT HE
[1:34:49] WORE, EVERY SHIRT HE HUNTED IN, EVER
[1:34:52] SUIT WORE. I THANK GOD FOR THAT. AND IF
[1:34:54] I HAD THE PRIVILEGE, AMEN, TO LAY MY
[1:34:56] HANDS ON THAT, I WOULD BE VERY THANKFUL.
[1:34:59] BUT CHURCH OF LIVING GOD, THIS IS NOT A
[1:35:01] HISTORICAL MESSAGE.
[1:35:04] WHEN YOU START SITTING THERE LOOKING FOR
[1:35:06] SOMETHING TO COME IN A NATURAL PHYSICAL
[1:35:09] FORM BEFORE GOD CAN MOVE, YOU ARE
[1:35:11] PARALYZING YOUR FAITH.
[1:35:15] &gt;&gt; I'll tell you, GOD HAS PROVIDED AN
[1:35:18] APPROPRIATE PLACE. HOW MANY BELIEVERS
[1:35:20] HAVE I GOT HERE TONIGHT? AMEN. COME ON.
[1:35:23] GOD HAS PROVIDED AN APPROPRIATE PLACE
[1:35:26] FOR THE BELIEVER. CAN I TELL YOU WHERE
[1:35:28] THAT'S AT? IT'S UNDER THE BLOOD.
[1:35:32] &gt;&gt; COME ON. WE'RE NOT UNDER SOME MAN-MADE
[1:35:34] MOVEMENT, FOLKS.
[1:35:36] [laughter] CAN I PREACH? WE'RE NOT UNDER
[1:35:39] SOME SOME SOME PERSONALITY AS SOME MAN.
[1:35:42] AMEN. I just want TO DROP THIS IN HERE.
[1:35:44] GRACE TABERNACLE IS ONE BODY
[1:35:47] &gt;&gt; AND WE HAVE ONE PASTOR AND HIS NAME IS
[1:35:50] MATT MORSE. THERE'S NOT LITTLE GROUPS
[1:35:52] AND LITTLE FOLLOWINGS AND WE'RE BEHIND
[1:35:54] THIS GUY. OH, THAT'S A BUNCH OF
[1:35:56] NONSENSE. THERE IS ONE CHURCH. THERE IS
[1:35:59] ONE BODY AND WE GOT ONE FAITH AND WE GOT
[1:36:02] ONE VISION AND THAT IS THE POWER OF GOD
[1:36:04] TO COME INTO THE CHURCH AND MANIFEST
[1:36:07] HIMSELF UPON THE REALITY OF HIS WORD.
[1:36:10] Come on. I don't care. [laughter]
[1:36:13] Oh God,
[1:36:15] I DON'T CARE WHAT KIND OF PERSONALITY OR
[1:36:17] WHAT KIND OF SUCCESS OR WHAT KIND OF I
[1:36:19] DON'T CARE ABOUT. AMEN. WE GOT ONE
[1:36:20] PASTOR. WE GOT ONE BODY. I'M JUST
[1:36:23] PREACHING. WE GOT ONE VISION AND WE GOT
[1:36:26] ONE GOAL AND WE GOT ONE ACHIEVEMENT AND
[1:36:28] THAT'S THE RAPTURE.
[1:36:31] &gt;&gt; AND WE'RE UNDER ONE PLACE AND THAT'S THE
[1:36:33] BLOOD.
[1:36:35] &gt;&gt; AND IT'S NOT ANY KIND OF BLOOD. YOU KNOW
[1:36:37] WHAT A PROPHET CALLED IT? HE CALLED IT
[1:36:39] AN APPROPRIATE BLOOD.
[1:36:41] GLORY TO GOD. HE CALLED IT AN
[1:36:43] APPROPRIATE BLOOD. THAT MEANS THE
[1:36:46] WORSHIPPER THAT COMES BEFORE GOD WITH
[1:36:49] THIS APPROPRIATE BLOOD APPROPRIATE IT.
[1:36:52] GLORY TO GOD. WHEN YOU GET UNDER THE
[1:36:55] APPROPRIATED BLOOD, THERE IS A POWER OF
[1:36:58] APPROPRIATION THAT COMES UPON YOUR LIFE
[1:37:01] BY THAT BLOOD. NOW, I GOT TO SAY WHAT A
[1:37:03] PROPHET SAID. HE SAID, "GOD CHOSE BLOOD
[1:37:06] for salvation."
[1:37:08] &gt;&gt; Now, DO YOU SEE WHEN YOU GET A CANE IN
[1:37:10] THE MIDST,
[1:37:13] &gt;&gt; replace the blood and put ethics in
[1:37:16] there.
[1:37:17] &gt;&gt; REPLACE THE BLOOD AND PUT BUSINESS IN
[1:37:19] THERE. REPLACE THE BLOOD AND PUT
[1:37:22] EDUCATION IN THERE. LISTEN, THIS IS NOT
[1:37:24] A CAIN CHURCH. AND YOU'RE LOOKING AT ONE
[1:37:27] PREACHER THAT'LL PREACH THE FIRE OUT OF
[1:37:29] THAT DEVIL UNTIL HE TAKES HIS HANDS OFF
[1:37:31] OF EVERY PERSON HE'S TRYING TO HOLD.
[1:37:34] &gt;&gt; I don't believe in works. I DON'T
[1:37:36] BELIEVE IN HOW GOOD YOU ARE, HOW MUCH
[1:37:38] MONEY YOU HAVE, HOW IMPORTANT YOU ARE. I
[1:37:40] CARE ABOUT ONE THING, THAT IS THE BLOOD
[1:37:43] OF JESUS CHRIST THAT CAN WASH AWAY THE
[1:37:46] SIN. I DON'T CARE HOW VILE YOU ARE. I
[1:37:49] DON'T CARE HOW DIRTY YOU ARE. I DON'T
[1:37:51] CARE HOW BROKE YOU ARE. LET ME SHOUT
[1:37:54] TONIGHT, THERE IS A BLOOD AND IT'S AN
[1:37:57] APPROPRIATE BLOOD.
[1:37:59] &gt;&gt; AND IF A BELIEVER EVER GETS UNDER THAT
[1:38:01] APPROPRIATE BLOOD, IT'LL RELEASE THEM
[1:38:03] FROM EVERY SPIRIT. IT'LL RELEASE THEM
[1:38:05] FROM EVERY FEAR. IT'LL RELEASE THEM FROM
[1:38:07] THE FEAR OF THE FUTURE. I DON'T KNOW
[1:38:09] WHAT'S GOING TO HAPPEN. I DON'T KNOW
[1:38:10] WHAT TOMORROW HOLD. IT DON'T MATTER WHAT
[1:38:13] TOMORROW HOLDS. IF THE BLOOD IS HOLDING
[1:38:16] YOUR FUTURE, YOU'RE GOING TO COME OUT OF
[1:38:18] IT. BECAUSE IT'S AN APPROPRIATE BLOOD
[1:38:22] &gt;&gt; AND IT WORKS NO MATTER WHAT THE
[1:38:24] CIRCUMSTANCES ARE.
[1:38:28] &gt;&gt; Without the shedding of blood, there is
[1:38:31] no remission
[1:38:33] &gt;&gt; of sins.
[1:38:35] &gt;&gt; And let ME PUT THAT DEVIL WHAT'S THE
[1:38:37] TEENAGERS call on blast. LET ME PUT THAT
[1:38:40] DEVIL ON NOTICE TONIGHT.
[1:38:42] This is not a blood that was spilled.
[1:38:47] [panting]
[1:38:47] &gt;&gt; BROTHER SAID, "YOU SPILL SOMETHING, YOU
[1:38:49] DONE IT BY ACCIDENT."
[1:38:52] &gt;&gt; He said, "THIS BLOOD WAS SHED,
[1:38:54] &gt;&gt; WHICH MEANS IT WAS SHED ON PURPOSE,
[1:38:57] WHICH MEANS THERE'S A PURPOSE BEHIND
[1:38:58] IT." OH, IF I WAS THE DEVIL, I WOULD TRY
[1:39:02] TO REPLACE THE BLOOD, TOO. WHAT CAN WASH
[1:39:04] AWAY MY SIN? NOTHING BUT THE BLOOD OF
[1:39:07] JESUS. WHAT CAN MAKE ME WHOLE AGAIN?
[1:39:10] NOTHING BUT THE BLOOD OF JESUS. WHAT CAN
[1:39:13] BRING ME OUT OF THE DARKEST TRIALS OF MY
[1:39:15] LIFE? [screaming] NOTHING BUT THE BLOOD
[1:39:18] OF JESUS.
[1:39:20] [applause]
[1:39:22] &gt;&gt; OH, brother B stood there. He said, I'm
[1:39:24] sorry. He said, "Having therefore,
[1:39:26] brethren, boldness to enter into the
[1:39:28] holies by the blood of Jesus."
[1:39:31] [laughter]
[1:39:31] Brother said, "I stood there the other
[1:39:33] DAY WHERE PAUL WAS IN THAT old chamber.
[1:39:35] They cut his head off. He said he pissed
[1:39:37] over there in the sewer." Now watch
[1:39:39] this. BROTHER, BROTHER BROTHER BOBBY,
[1:39:41] THEY CUT PAUL'S HEAD OFF. THE MAN THAT
[1:39:43] WROTE Hebrews 9, brother David, the man
[1:39:46] that went and got the revelation of THE
[1:39:48] POWER AND THE AUTHORITY OF THE BLOOD.
[1:39:51] BROTHER SAID, "OH, THEY CUT HIS HEAD OFF
[1:39:53] AND PITCHED IT OVER IN a sewer, BUT THEY
[1:39:56] NEVER WASHED OUT THE POWER OF GOD."
[1:40:01] COME ON, CHURCH. THERE WAS AN EVIDENCE A
[1:40:03] BELIEVER HAD BEEN IN THAT PRISON. AH, I
[1:40:06] FEEL GOOD TONIGHT. I FEEL LIKE PREACHING
[1:40:08] FOR A SECOND. I WANT EVERY TRIAL I GO
[1:40:11] THROUGH. I WANT THE I WANT TO LEAVE AN
[1:40:13] EVIDENCE THAT THERE WAS A BELIEVER IN
[1:40:15] THIS TRIAL AND I WANT TO LEAVE AN
[1:40:17] EVIDENCE THERE WAS A BELIEVER THAT CAME
[1:40:19] OUT OF IT. AMEN. I DON'T JUST WANT TO
[1:40:21] WALK THROUGH THERE AND COME OUT SMELLING
[1:40:23] LIKE ROSES. I WANT TO LEAVE SOME
[1:40:24] EVIDENCE THERE THAT A SON OF GOD WENT
[1:40:27] THROUGH THIS TROUBLE, WENT THROUGH THIS
[1:40:29] PROBLEM, WENT THROUGH THIS SICKNESS, BUT
[1:40:30] IT DIDN'T DEFEAT HIM. HE OVERCAME IT BY
[1:40:34] THE BLOOD OF THE LAMB AND BY THE WORD OF
[1:40:37] HIS TESTIMONY. I'M NOT TALKING ABOUT A
[1:40:40] CHURCH FAITH. I'M TALKING ABOUT A LIVING
[1:40:42] FAITH.
[1:40:44] &gt;&gt; Oh yeah. He said, "What happened?" He I
[1:40:47] got to skip over some of this. He said,
[1:40:48] "What did he do?" HE SAID, "HE FOLLOWED
[1:40:50] THOSE BLOODY FOOTPRINTS AND HE
[1:40:52] recognized that the blood of Jesus
[1:40:54] Christ, are y'all ready for this? is the
[1:40:58] only appropriate way for sinners to
[1:41:01] reach God.
[1:41:03] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[1:41:04] &gt;&gt; AND THERE WAS RECONCILED TO GOD THROUGH
[1:41:07] FAITH. AND GOD GAVE HIM THE HOLY GHOST,
[1:41:10] BAPTIZED AT THE RIVER DAMASCUS, WENT
[1:41:12] DOWN TO ARABIA for three years, and then
[1:41:15] come back. [panting]
[1:41:17] [sighs and gasps] Brother Brian,
[1:41:19] PREACHING THE FAITH
[1:41:21] &gt;&gt; THAT HE ONCE LOCKED UP.
[1:41:25] &gt;&gt; OH, GOD. FOLKS, I'm getting free right
[1:41:28] now.
[1:41:30] &gt;&gt; HE LOCKED UP THE FAITH THAT WAS ONCE
[1:41:32] DELIVERED TO THE SAINTS. BUT WHEN HE GOT
[1:41:35] UNDERNEATH THE BLOOD,
[1:41:38] &gt;&gt; COME ON, CHURCH. Y'ALL REMEMBER THE DAYS
[1:41:40] WHEN NOBODY WOULD LISTEN TO YOU. WHEN
[1:41:42] THEY KNEW YOUR MISTAKES AND THEY KNEW
[1:41:44] YOUR HABITS AND THEY KNEW YOUR BLUNDERS
[1:41:46] AND THEY KNEW YOUR FAILURES AND THEY
[1:41:47] DIDN'T CARE TO SEE YOU, LET ALONE HEAR
[1:41:50] YOU. [laughter]
[1:41:51] I could get real open here, BUT I WON'T.
[1:41:53] AMEN. BUT RIGHT NOW, YOU'RE LISTENING TO
[1:41:55] HIM. YOU KNOW WHY? BECAUSE THERE'S
[1:41:58] NOTHING AS POWERFUL AS THE PREACHING OF
[1:42:01] THE BLOOD OF JESUS CHRIST THROUGH THE
[1:42:04] FAITH OF GOD. I TELL YOU WHAT, THE
[1:42:06] PREACH OF THE BLOOD WITH THE FAITH OF
[1:42:08] GOD WILL UNLOCK YOUR
[1:42:10] [laughter and gasps]
[1:42:10] IT'LL UNLOCK YOUR FAMILY. IT'LL UNLOCK
[1:42:13] YOUR HOME. I'M TALKING ABOUT THE BLOOD.
[1:42:15] NOW, NOW, CAN I SAY SOMETHING TO YOU,
[1:42:17] BROTHER JOE? I'M SORRY. I'M A LITTLE
[1:42:19] EXCITED, but this is a moving blood.
[1:42:22] WHEN I GET TO THINKING ABOUT THE POWER
[1:42:25] THAT'S BEHIND THIS BLOOD SAID I STOOD
[1:42:28] THERE THE OTHER DAY AND HE SAID THAT
[1:42:29] LITTLE THAT LITTLE COLORED MAN SLAVE WAS
[1:42:31] STANDING THERE AND HE WAS ALL TORE UP
[1:42:33] AND SCREAMING AND BESIDE HIMSELF AND
[1:42:35] THEY ASKED HIM THEY SAID BROTHER
[1:42:37] BRANDHAM he said SIR HE SAID WHY ARE YOU
[1:42:39] SO HAPPY HE SAID BROTHER I WANT YOU TO
[1:42:42] LOOK ON MY back he said do you see the
[1:42:44] slave marks on MY BACK SAID I DO he said
[1:42:48] I WANT YOU TO LOOK ON THAT dress he said
[1:42:50] do you see THE BLOOD THAT'S ON THAT
[1:42:53] DRESS. He said, "I do." HE SAID, "THAT'S
[1:42:56] NOT THE BLOOD OF ANY MAN." HE SAID,
[1:42:58] "THAT'S THE BLOOD OF ABRAHAM LINCOLN."
[1:43:00] AND HE SAID, "THAT'S THE BLOOD THAT WAS
[1:43:02] SHED." COME on now, WAS WAS WAS POURED
[1:43:06] OUT UPON HIS WIFE'S GARMENT. AMEN.
[1:43:08] BECAUSE OF WHAT HE WAS STANDING FOR, HE
[1:43:10] SAID THE MAN GOT HAPPY AND HE SAID, "HOW
[1:43:13] COULD I KNOW THAT BLOOD SET ME FREE AND
[1:43:15] NOT GET EXCITED ABOUT IT?" BROTHER DAVID
[1:43:18] PAUL SAID, "OH, I THOUGHT, BROTHER, I
[1:43:21] RESPECT YOU AND I WANT TO SHOUT WITH
[1:43:23] YOU." HE SAID, "BUT LET ME TAKE IT A
[1:43:25] LITTLE HIGHER." OH, HE SAID, "LET ME
[1:43:28] TAKE IT A LITTLE HIGHER." HE SAID, "DO
[1:43:30] YOU SEE THE SLAVE MARKS OF SIN AND OF
[1:43:32] UNBELIEF AND OF THE DEVIL ON MY BACK?"
[1:43:35] HE SAID, "BUT 2,000 YEARS AGO, OUR LORD
[1:43:38] JESUS HUNG BETWEEN THE HEAVENS AND THE
[1:43:40] EARTH, AND HE APPRECIATED A BLOOD THAT
[1:43:44] WOULD RELEASE THE VIOLENCE OF SINNER."
[1:43:46] COME ON. IS ANYBODY GOING TO RISE TO
[1:43:48] RAISE THEIR HANDS AND SHOUT IN THE HOUSE
[1:43:51] OF GOD IS THE BRIDE WHO IS UNDER THE
[1:43:54] APPROPRIATE BLOOD?
[1:43:58] IT'S AN APPROPRIATE BLOOD. AND NOW'S AN
[1:44:00] APPROPRIATE TIME TO WORSHIP GOD FOR THAT
[1:44:04] APPROPRIATE BLOOD.
[1:44:08] Come on. NOW IS AN APPROPRIATE TIME.
[1:44:11] COME ON. RIGHT NOW IS AN APPROPRIATE
[1:44:13] TIME TO SAY, "THANK YOU, LORD, FOR THE
[1:44:16] BLOOD." NOW IS AN APPROPRIATE TIME TO
[1:44:20] SAY, "THANK YOU, LORD, FOR THE STRIPES
[1:44:22] THAT YOU BORE UP ON YOUR BACK.
[1:44:27] &gt;&gt; Then I could be healed." [laughter]
[1:44:30] I'm talking about a believer who's not
[1:44:32] just contending,
[1:44:34] &gt;&gt; BUT THEY'RE POSSESSING.
[1:44:36] &gt;&gt; THEY'RE POSSESSING THE REALITIES OF GOD.
[1:44:38] NOW,
[1:44:40] &gt;&gt; get out of here, devil.
[1:44:42] I love what a prophet said.
[1:44:44] &gt;&gt; He said that blood will tear down every
[1:44:46] denominational wall.
[1:44:49] &gt;&gt; HE SAID THAT BLOOD WILL MAKE US ALL one
[1:44:54] &gt;&gt; and it'll MAKE US ALL LOVE each other.
[1:44:59] &gt;&gt; Now, I'm not talking about the blood of
[1:45:00] a church
[1:45:02] &gt;&gt; or the blood of a bull.
[1:45:04] &gt;&gt; Talking about the blood of God. Now, I
[1:45:06] want I want can I move a step further?
[1:45:09] There's another meaning to that word
[1:45:10] appropriate.
[1:45:12] &gt;&gt; It's a verb
[1:45:14] which means there's an action.
[1:45:16] &gt;&gt; I'm doing good, ain't I? Okay.
[1:45:20] It mean I trying to embarrass myself
[1:45:22] with my education.
[1:45:24] It means to take possession of what
[1:45:28] already belongs to you. Hallelujah.
[1:45:33] &gt;&gt; SO WHEN YOU ARE APPROPRIATING,
[1:45:36] you're not getting it or buying it.
[1:45:39] You're taking possession.
[1:45:41] &gt;&gt; It already BELONGS TO YOU.
[1:45:45] &gt;&gt; COME ON, FOLKS. BROTHER SAID, "WATCH."
[1:45:47] HE SAID, "IT'S THE FAITH OF GOD." NOW,
[1:45:49] LOOK AT THIS HERE. THAT APPROPRIATE, IT
[1:45:52] IS ACTUALLY A SUBJECTIVE FAITH.
[1:45:54] &gt;&gt; AMEN. IT MAKES GOD'S PROMISES. ARE Y'ALL
[1:45:57] READY FOR THIS? IT MAKES GOD'S PROMISES
[1:46:00] PERSONALLY
[1:46:05] &gt;&gt; OPERATIVE TO YOU.
[1:46:07] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH.
[1:46:08] &gt;&gt; Are y'all ready for this?
[1:46:10] &gt;&gt; You know what you do when you
[1:46:11] appropriate faith? You are receiving
[1:46:14] what God has provided.
[1:46:17] &gt;&gt; Can I Can I give you a little something
[1:46:18] for 2026?
[1:46:20] &gt;&gt; Will you take it?
[1:46:22] &gt;&gt; Receiving, walking, applying, living.
[1:46:25] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH.
[1:46:27] RECEIVING WHAT GOD HAS ALREADY PROVIDED,
[1:46:30] WALKING IN THE PROMISES, APPLYING THE
[1:46:33] WORD PERSONALLY, AND LIVING BY THE FAITH
[1:46:36] DAILY.
[1:46:37] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH.
[1:46:39] &gt;&gt; THEN THERE IS A PEOPLE THAT HAS NOT
[1:46:42] DENIED [screaming] MY NAME.
[1:46:45] &gt;&gt; COME ON. THEY HAVE HELD FAST TO MY NAME
[1:46:48] AND HAVE NOT DENIED MY SALVATION. NOTICE
[1:46:50] IN ACTS 3 AND:E 16 HE SAID THAT IS
[1:46:53] EXACTLY WHAT HAPPENED WITH THE MIGHTY
[1:46:55] MIRACLE. HE SAID AND HIS JESUS NAME
[1:46:58] through faith IN HIS JESUS NAME HATH
[1:47:01] MADE THIS MAN a formal strong
[1:47:06] yay THE FAITH WHICH IS BY FROM HIM JESUS
[1:47:10] HATH GIVEN HIM THE MAN THE PERFECT
[1:47:13] SOUNDNESS IN THE PRESENCE OF YOU ALL.
[1:47:17] See there it is. Jesus name and Jesus
[1:47:22] faith AND IT BROUGHT ABOUT A MIRACLE.
[1:47:25] PETER DID NOT CLAIM IT WAS HIS OWN HUMAN
[1:47:28] FAITH ANYMORE THAN HE CLAIMED IT WAS HIS
[1:47:31] OWN NAME. YOU KNOW WHAT HE SAID? HE SAID
[1:47:35] THAT JESUS NAME USED IN THE FAITH WHICH
[1:47:39] WAS FROM JESUS PERFORMED THAT GREAT
[1:47:41] WORK. THE FAITH, THIS FAITH IS WHAT the
[1:47:45] Lord WAS SPEAKING ABOUT, WHAT HE WAS
[1:47:47] REPORTING, WHAT HE WAS DELIVERING, WHAT
[1:47:50] HE WAS VERBALLY GIVING IN REVELATION
[1:47:53] 21:13. IT WAS HIS FAITH. IT WAS NOT
[1:47:57] FAITH IN HIM, BUT IT WAS HIS OWN FAITH
[1:48:01] THAT HE HAD GIVEN TO THE BELIEVERS.
[1:48:04] &gt;&gt; NOW, NOW, NOW, can you take this? In
[1:48:07] this age of rapid degradation, there
[1:48:09] were still the few who had the measure
[1:48:13] of our fa of that faith of our Lord
[1:48:15] Jesus Christ. Now, I love what he says
[1:48:17] here. That was a living faith. He says,
[1:48:20] "I live by the faith of the SON OF GOD."
[1:48:22] PAUL DID NOT SAY HE LIVED BY faith in
[1:48:26] the son of God. It was the faith,
[1:48:30] hope I'm not driving this too far,
[1:48:32] OF THE SON OF GOD THAT HAD GIVEN HIM
[1:48:35] LIFE. and kept him living IN CHRISTIAN
[1:48:39] VICTORY.
[1:48:40] &gt;&gt; COME ON, CHURCH. HE WAS NOT JUST
[1:48:43] VISITING IT ON SUNDAYS.
[1:48:46] &gt;&gt; HE WAS NOT JUST VISITING IT WHEN HE WENT
[1:48:48] TO CHURCH OR WENT TO YOUTH CAMP OR NO,
[1:48:51] HE WAS LIVING IN CHRISTIAN VICTORY. A
[1:48:54] PROPHET STOOD THERE AND SAID, I SAY THIS
[1:48:56] UPON THE AUTHORITY OF GOD'S WORD, THERE
[1:48:59] IS NO LIMIT TO THE FAITH OF GOD THAT HE
[1:49:02] LEFT FOR HIS CHURCH.
[1:49:05] THERE IS NO LIMIT TO THE FAITH OF GOD
[1:49:08] THAT HE LEFT FOR HIS CHURCH BECAUSE HE
[1:49:11] SAID, [laughter]
[1:49:12] BECAUSE HE REPORTED, BECAUSE HE
[1:49:15] DELIVERED THAT ALL THINGS ARE POSSIBLE
[1:49:18] TO THEM THAT BELIEVE. YOU SAY, "HOW MUCH
[1:49:20] CAN I HAVE?" BROTHER ANDREW, ARE YOU
[1:49:23] READY FOR THIS? AS MUCH AS YOU CAN ALLOW
[1:49:26] THE HOLY GHOST TO APPROPRIATE THE FAITH
[1:49:29] OF GOD IN YOUR LIFE,
[1:49:32] WHAT YOU WHETHER YOU
[1:49:36] WHETHER YOU CAN APPROPRIATE THE FAITH, I
[1:49:38] DO NOT KNOW. BUT WHAT GOD SAYS IS THE
[1:49:41] TRUTH.
[1:49:42] &gt;&gt; OH, HE GAVE US THE STRONGEST WEAPON
[1:49:43] THERE IS, FOLKS. AMEN. I'M GOING I'M
[1:49:46] GOING TO DRIVE IT HOME. [panting]
[1:49:49] &gt;&gt; I got a little more time.
[1:49:51] &gt;&gt; AND EVERY REDEMPTIVE BLESSING BELONGS TO
[1:49:54] YOU AND I. AMEN.
[1:49:57] &gt;&gt; Some of them,
[1:49:59] &gt;&gt; A FEW OF THEM,
[1:50:01] &gt;&gt; EVERY REDEMPTIVE BLESSING BELONGS TO YOU
[1:50:04] AND I. THE ONLY THING IS to appropriate
[1:50:09] THE FAITH TO RECEIVE IT.
[1:50:11] &gt;&gt; ABRAHAM GOES TO ISAIAH 53 AND SAID, "HE
[1:50:14] WAS WOUNDED FOR OUR TRANSGRESSION. HE
[1:50:17] WAS BRUISED FOR OUR INIQUITY. THE
[1:50:19] CHASTISEMENT OF OUR PIECES UPON HIM AND
[1:50:22] WITH HIS STRIPES we were healed.
[1:50:27] &gt;&gt; BROTHER JOE, IT'S ALL PAST TENSE.
[1:50:31] &gt;&gt; COME ON RIGHT NOW. SOME OF Y'ALL ARE
[1:50:32] LETTING THE DEVIL BEAT YOU OUT OF THE
[1:50:34] GOOD SERVICE. YOU'RE LETTING THE DEVIL
[1:50:35] BEAT YOU OUT OF PRAISING GOD. YOU'RE
[1:50:37] LETTING THE DEVIL HOLD YOU DOWN WITH
[1:50:39] SOME OLD PROBLEM OR SOME OLD SITUATION.
[1:50:42] CAN I TELL YOU WHAT THE PROPHET OF GOD
[1:50:43] SAID? HE SAID, "IT'S A FINISHED WORK.
[1:50:46] IT'S JUST SOMETHING YOU GOT TO LOOK TO
[1:50:47] CALVARY WHERE THE SUPREME SACRIFICE WAS
[1:50:50] MADE AND THERE WE DRAW THE REMINATIONS
[1:50:53] FROM HIS DEATH BY OUR FAITH IN HIS
[1:50:56] FINISHED WORK. WELL, BROTHER ANDREW, I'M
[1:50:58] NOT GOOD ENOUGH. THERE'S NOTHING I CAN
[1:50:59] DO. THERE'S NOTHING SOMEONE ELSE CAN DO.
[1:51:02] BUT IT'S WHAT GOD HAS DONE AND WHAT WE
[1:51:06] BELIEVE HE HAS DONE. THEREFORE, we take
[1:51:08] it. WE TAKE IT FROM THE WORD AND BASE
[1:51:13] OUR FAITH UPON THE FINISHED WORK. Can I
[1:51:16] SAY WHAT A PROPHET SAID IS THE MAIN
[1:51:19] THING IS NOT WHAT YOU BELIEVE.
[1:51:23] ARE YOU READY FOR THIS? IT'S WHO you
[1:51:25] believe.
[1:51:27] &gt;&gt; AND TONIGHT HE SAYS, I BELIEVE THAT
[1:51:29] JESUS CHRIST IS THE SON OF GOD. HE SAID,
[1:51:32] THEN THE ONLY THING WE CAN DO IS TEACH
[1:51:34] IT. IT'S ALREADY BEEN ACHIEVED. NOW IT'S
[1:51:36] UP TO YOU AND I TO APPROPRIATE THE FAITH
[1:51:38] IN OURSELVES TO ACCEPT WHAT CHRIST HAS
[1:51:42] DONE. NOW, NOW LOOK HERE IN ROMANS 8:32,
[1:51:45] PAUL SAYS IT BEAUTIFUL. HE SAYS, "HE
[1:51:47] THAT SPARED NOT HIS OWN SON, ARE ARE
[1:51:50] Y'ALL READY FOR THIS? BUT DELIVERED,
[1:51:52] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH,
[1:51:54] &gt;&gt; BUT DELIVERED HIM UP FOR SOME OF US,
[1:51:58] &gt;&gt; FOR A FEW OF US, FOR US ALL. HOW SHALL
[1:52:03] HE NOT WITH HIM ALSO FREELY GIVE US ALL
[1:52:08] THINGS?
[1:52:10] &gt;&gt; Now I'm going to punch that devil square
[1:52:13] in the face and you can sit there and
[1:52:14] watch me.
[1:52:16] &gt;&gt; AS SORROWFUL
[1:52:18] YET ALWAYS REJOICING.
[1:52:22] &gt;&gt; AS POOR YET MAKING MANY RICH.
[1:52:27] &gt;&gt; AS HAVING NOTHING.
[1:52:32] I'm not trying to be mean, but that
[1:52:34] THAT'S THE WAY SOME OF Y'ALL sit in
[1:52:35] church.
[1:52:37] &gt;&gt; It's as if you have nothing.
[1:52:42] &gt;&gt; And you sit THERE AND LOOK AT SOMEBODY
[1:52:44] THAT SHOUTED AND YOU SAY, "WELL, THEY'RE
[1:52:46] just worked up." And if they were going
[1:52:48] through the same things,
[1:52:50] &gt;&gt; NO, IT'S BECAUSE THEY'VE LEARNED TO
[1:52:52] APPROPRIATE THE FAITH.
[1:52:55] &gt;&gt; COME ON. PAUL SAID, "YOU'RE SORROWFUL,
[1:52:57] BUT YOU'RE REJOICING. YOU'RE POOR YET
[1:53:00] MAKING MANY RICH. COME ON, CHURCH. YOU
[1:53:03] SAY, "PREACHER, HOW CAN YOU SAY THAT?
[1:53:04] I'M A POOR MAN." BUT GOD HAS TAKEN THIS
[1:53:07] PIECE OF TENNESSEE DIRT AND SENT ME
[1:53:09] AROUND THE WORLD AND I MADE A LOT OF
[1:53:11] PEOPLE RICH.
[1:53:14] &gt;&gt; I know some devil like TO GET A HOLD OF
[1:53:16] THAT AND TWIST IT. WELL, BEFORE YOU DO,
[1:53:17] LET me finish.
[1:53:19] &gt;&gt; I DON'T HAVE NO MONEY TO GIVE THEM. I
[1:53:21] DON'T HAVE NO PERSONALITY TO OFFER HIM,
[1:53:23] BUT I COME REPRESENTING MY FATHER WHO
[1:53:25] OWNS THE CATTLE ON A THOUSAND HEELS.
[1:53:29] I'VE STOOD IN AFRICA AND PREACHED THIS
[1:53:31] FAITH AND WATCHED POOR PEOPLE RECEIVE
[1:53:33] IT. COME ON. I'M GOING TO TELL YOU, IF
[1:53:36] IT WORKS IN AFRICA, IF IT WORKS IN
[1:53:38] CANADA, IF IT WORKS IN EUROPE,
[1:53:41] IT'LL WORK RIGHT HERE IN BLACK ROCKCK,
[1:53:44] ARKANSAS. I DON'T CARE HOW SORROWFUL YOU
[1:53:46] ARE. I DON'T CARE HOW PITIFUL YOU ARE.
[1:53:48] IF YOU CAN LET THE HOLY GHOST COME BY
[1:53:51] AND SHAKE YOU TONIGHT AND RECOGNIZE YOU
[1:53:54] ARE POOR, YOU ARE MADE RICH, YOU HAVE
[1:53:57] NOTHING, BUT YOU POSSESS ALL THINGS.
[1:54:06] &gt;&gt; Even the flies enjoying it.
[1:54:11] &gt;&gt; It'll never work for you
[1:54:14] &gt;&gt; until you appropriate it.
[1:54:17] &gt;&gt; Come on.
[1:54:18] [gasps]
[1:54:19] I'm running out of time, but I got to
[1:54:20] say this.
[1:54:23] &gt;&gt; A little boy, Brother Wesley, was on a
[1:54:25] ship, and there was a great big
[1:54:27] important man called the captain of that
[1:54:29] ship, and he was up there dying. And
[1:54:32] brother Joel, he said, "Is there any
[1:54:34] little gospel preachers?"
[1:54:36] Sorry,
[1:54:37] &gt;&gt; I'm having fun.
[1:54:40] &gt;&gt; IS THERE ANYBODY ON THIS SHIP THAT'S GOT
[1:54:42] A BIBLE?
[1:54:44] The little boy rose up in the back and
[1:54:45] said, "Good evening, friends."
[1:54:51] &gt;&gt; Glory to God.
[1:54:53] &gt;&gt; Good evening, friends. And he walked up
[1:54:56] there AND HE SAID, "I GOT A BIBLE." HE
[1:54:58] SAID, "WELL, READ ME SOMETHING OUT OF
[1:55:00] IT." HE SAID, "NOW, LET ME READ YOU
[1:55:01] ISAIAH 53.
[1:55:03] He was wounded for my transgression.
[1:55:06] &gt;&gt; He was BRUISED FOR MY INIQUITY. THE
[1:55:09] CHASTISEMENT OF MY PEACE WAS UPON HIM
[1:55:11] AND BY HIS STRIPES I AM HEALED. YOU KNOW
[1:55:14] WHAT THE CAPTAIN SAID? HE SAID, "THAT'S
[1:55:16] GOOD." LITTLE BOY SAID, "BUT WAIT A
[1:55:18] SECOND, [laughter]
[1:55:19] MAMA. THAT'S ME." HE SAID, "LET ME READ
[1:55:22] IT TO YOU THE WAY MY MAMA TAUGHT ME." HE
[1:55:24] SAID, "MY NAME'S WILLIE PUIT." AND
[1:55:26] HERE'S THE WAY MAMA TAUGHT ME TO READ
[1:55:28] IT. HE SAID, "HE WAS WOUNDED FOR WILLIE
[1:55:31] PUIT'S TRANSGRESSION. He was bruised FOR
[1:55:33] WILLIE PUIT'S INIQUITY. THE CHASTISEMENT
[1:55:36] OF WILLY'S WILL PUIT'S PEACE WAS UPON
[1:55:38] HIM AND BY HIS STRIPES, WILLIE PUIT IS
[1:55:41] HEALED. NOW, COME ON. AS LONG AS HE WAS
[1:55:44] TALKING ABOUT HIMSELF, HE WAS
[1:55:46] APPROPRIATING IT UNTO HIMSELF, THAT OLD
[1:55:49] CAPTAIN MUST HAVE FELT SOMETHING. He
[1:55:51] must HAVE FELT SOMETHING CUZ BROTHER
[1:55:53] MARK, HE SAID, "WONDER IF YOU COULD READ
[1:55:55] MY name in there." HE SAID, "I BET YOU I
[1:55:58] COULD. I WONDER IF YOU COULD READ MY
[1:56:00] NAME IN THERE." HE SAID, "SIR, WHAT'S
[1:56:02] YOUR NAME?" HE SAID, "IT'S JOHN QUARTZ."
[1:56:05] HE SAID, "WELL, HERE WE GO. HE WAS
[1:56:07] WOUNDED FOR JOHN COURT'S INIQUITY. HE
[1:56:09] WAS BRUISED FOR JOHN COURT'S
[1:56:11] CHASTISEMENT. THE CHASTISEMENT OF JOHN'S
[1:56:14] COURT'S PEACE WAS UPON HIM. AND BY HIS
[1:56:16] STRIPES, JOHN QUARTZ IS HEALED." RE SAID
[1:56:21] THAT CAPTAIN THAT WAS ON HIS DEATHBED,
[1:56:23] HE SHOOK HIMSELF AND HE SAID, "SOMEBODY
[1:56:26] GO GET MY BOOTS. I'M GOING TO LIVE."
[1:56:29] &gt;&gt; [laughter]
[1:56:29] &gt;&gt; HE GOT UP OUT OF THAT CRIPPLED
[1:56:32] CONDITION.
[1:56:34] CHURCH, THE LIVING GOD, ANDREW GLOVER
[1:56:36] HAS NOTHING. BUT I'VE GIVE MY LIFE TO
[1:56:39] PREACH THIS MESSAGE. AND WHEREVER I GET
[1:56:41] A PULL PIT, I'M GOING TO STAND THERE AND
[1:56:43] I'M GOING TO SAY HE WAS WOUNDED FOR
[1:56:45] CHARLES INIQUITY. HE WAS BRUISED FOR
[1:56:47] MATT'S CHASTISEMENT. COME ON. AND BY HIS
[1:56:50] STRIPES
[1:56:53] AND BY HIS STRIPES, MATT IS HEALED. AND
[1:56:56] BOBBY IS HEALED. AND
[1:57:00] COME ON, SOMEBODY. IT'S TIME TO QUIT
[1:57:03] CONTENDING FOR THE FAITH. IT'S TIME TO
[1:57:05] APPROPRIATE THE FAITH.
[1:57:08] YOU SAY, "PREACHER, YOU LOST YOUR MIND."
[1:57:10] NO, I HAVEN'T.
[1:57:12] Any promise belongs to you.
[1:57:15] &gt;&gt; If you have the faith to appropriate it,
[1:57:20] &gt;&gt; contending for the faith is corporate.
[1:57:23] Everybody does it. Appropriating the
[1:57:25] faith is personal. Contending for the
[1:57:28] faith is defensive. Appropriating the
[1:57:30] faith is exper experimental.
[1:57:33] Contending for the faith is doctrinal.
[1:57:36] Appropriating the faith is practical.
[1:57:39] Contending for the faith protects the
[1:57:41] word. Appropriating the faith produces
[1:57:44] the results. Contending for the faith
[1:57:48] keeps the error out. Are y'all ready for
[1:57:50] this?
[1:57:52] &gt;&gt; Appropriating the faith brings the power
[1:57:54] in.
[1:57:56] You can contend without appropriating.
[1:58:00] &gt;&gt; And you know what you'll do? You'll
[1:58:02] become correct but powerless.
[1:58:06] &gt;&gt; You can appropriate without contending.
[1:58:09] You'll become experimental but unstable.
[1:58:12] But the bride of Christ will contend
[1:58:15] &gt;&gt; and she will appropriate
[1:58:17] because she's not just a hearer of the
[1:58:19] word.
[1:58:20] &gt;&gt; She's a doer.
[1:58:23] Can I can I close on this right here?
[1:58:26] &gt;&gt; Contending.
[1:58:27] I looked up I I I just wanted to find a
[1:58:29] simple illustration to break it down for
[1:58:31] you in contending and appropriate. I
[1:58:33] found this. It's just simple. Contending
[1:58:37] is guarding the deed to the property.
[1:58:43] Appropriating
[1:58:44] is moving in and living there.
[1:58:49] Glory to God.
[1:58:53] &gt;&gt; A deed unused still leaves you homeless.
[1:59:05] &gt;&gt; But the promises of God are movein
[1:59:08] ready.
[1:59:13] &gt;&gt; EVERY PROMISE IN THE BOOK IS MINE. EVERY
[1:59:16] CHAPTER, EVERY VERSE, EVERY LINE. COME
[1:59:19] ON, CHURCH. YOU KNOW WHAT I'M TALKING
[1:59:20] ABOUT. AMEN. AMEN. SOMEBODY SAY, "AMEN.
[1:59:23] WON'T YOU BUY A HOUSE AND WON'T YOU FIX
[1:59:24] IT UP? I'M SORRY. I DON'T HAVE TIME."
[1:59:27] AMEN. I DON'T HAVE TIME TO MOVE IN AND
[1:59:29] TER I'M NOT HOME MUCH. NEED SOMETHING
[1:59:32] MOVE IN READY.
[1:59:33] &gt;&gt; COME ON, FOLKS. WE DON'T HAVE MUCH TIME
[1:59:36] LEFT HERE. THERE'S A RAPTURE COMING. WE
[1:59:38] DON'T HAVE TIME. AMEN. TO FIX ALL THE
[1:59:41] PROMISES. THEY DON'T NEED TO BE FIXED.
[1:59:44] CAN I CAN I CLOSE BY SAYING THIS? THE
[1:59:46] PROMISES OF GOD ARE MOVE IN READY.
[1:59:51] WHEN YOU GOT THE DEED TO THE HOUSE, YOU
[1:59:53] SIGN IT, YOU CLOSE ON IT, THEY GIVE YOU
[1:59:56] THE KEYS, AND YOU LET EVERYBODY KNOW,
[1:59:59] I'M MOVING IN.
[2:00:01] I'M MOVING IN. WELL, CHURCH OF THE
[2:00:03] LIVING GOD, I THINK 2026 IS A GOOD YEAR
[2:00:07] TO MOVE IN TO EVERY DIVINE PROMISE. MOVE
[2:00:10] INTO THE PROMISE OF JOY. MOVE INTO THE
[2:00:13] PROMISE OF PEACE. MOVE INTO THE PROMISE
[2:00:15] OF HEALTH.
[2:00:17] &gt;&gt; COME ON, CHURCH. THE PROPHET OF GOD
[2:00:19] SAID, "IF THERE EVER WAS A TIME TO MOVE,
[2:00:21] IT'S TIME TO MOVE NOW. NOW IS THE TIME
[2:00:25] FOR ACTION."
[2:00:27] &gt;&gt; When you see the word and God working
[2:00:29] together, that's the time
[2:00:31] &gt;&gt; to move in with it. The move is on for
[2:00:36] the bride.
[2:00:38] &gt;&gt; When people's faith get up to a place,
[2:00:40] they'll see the they'll get the
[2:00:41] blessing. to realize it's theirs. Then
[2:00:44] the same operation of the Holy Spirit
[2:00:47] will be operating in the church like it
[2:00:50] did back there that our musicians come
[2:00:53] tonight.
[2:00:55] You say back there? What about in Mexico
[2:00:59] when that mother with that dead baby
[2:01:02] and the ushers couldn't keep her down,
[2:01:06] &gt;&gt; crawling through their legs and jumping
[2:01:08] over their shoulders and pushing them
[2:01:09] out of the way. Brother Bram said, "Just
[2:01:11] take brother Moore down there and pray
[2:01:13] for the baby." He said, "Then all of a
[2:01:14] sudden, a vision broke." I I I'm sorry,
[2:01:16] folks. I study Brother Bram too much.
[2:01:20] He said, "A vision broke." And he said,
[2:01:23] "Now look," he said, "that little baby
[2:01:24] laying there and I saw a little baby
[2:01:25] crying." He said, "I went down there,
[2:01:27] pray, they brought that baby there. I
[2:01:29] prayed for it." He said, "Now, Brother
[2:01:30] Espinosa," he said, "you go find me a
[2:01:33] verified record that that baby perished
[2:01:35] and died." He said the he said brother
[2:01:37] Espinosa went and got it found the woman
[2:01:39] found the doctor the baby had perished
[2:01:41] and died and the baby is well tonight.
[2:01:44] He said that's by the faith that was
[2:01:46] once delivered of the saints operating
[2:01:48] in a Catholic woman that did.
[2:01:50] &gt;&gt; He said the next day the press asked me
[2:01:52] did I think their saints could do the
[2:01:54] same thing. I said well if they were
[2:01:56] saints and a living they can.
[2:01:59] He said, "But see, it's a sanctified
[2:02:01] vessel that's set apart for God's
[2:02:04] service
[2:02:05] &gt;&gt; that God dwells in.
[2:02:07] &gt;&gt; It's not Catholic saints. It's Christian
[2:02:10] saints." What about that little boy up
[2:02:12] there in Saskatoon, Saskatchewan with
[2:02:14] that hunchback and he come up to Brother
[2:02:16] Brandham
[2:02:18] and he said, "Brother Brandom," he said,
[2:02:20] "I believe in divine healing from a
[2:02:21] statue. You pray to some dead person."
[2:02:23] Brother said, "Well, I believe in it."
[2:02:25] He said, "But I'm going to teach you a
[2:02:26] little different." He said, "I'm going
[2:02:28] to teach you the way the Bible teaches
[2:02:29] divine healing." Watch it. Watch it.
[2:02:32] Watch the spirit inspired preaching
[2:02:34] deliver the faith to a little boy and
[2:02:37] totally transform his view of divine
[2:02:38] healing.
[2:02:40] Abraham stood there and preached him the
[2:02:41] promises of divine healing. He said, "I
[2:02:43] believe it comes from God." He Now, now
[2:02:45] y'all want to know what what a prophet
[2:02:47] said divine healing is.
[2:02:49] He said it's God's eternal spoken word
[2:02:52] by born again people by prayer asking
[2:02:56] God [music] and God's obligated to his
[2:02:58] word. He said that little boy couldn't
[2:03:00] comprehend all of it but he said he
[2:03:02] believed it. He said all of a sudden
[2:03:04] that little boy come up there and he
[2:03:05] said here brother Brandham look raised
[2:03:08] up his little arms and that little hunch
[2:03:09] in his back was gone.
[2:03:11] &gt;&gt; Brother said what was it the faith that
[2:03:13] was once delivered of the saints
[2:03:14] operating in a child. Now folks, blind
[2:03:18] woman come up for prayer. He said, "I
[2:03:20] pray for you." She said, "Do you
[2:03:21] believe?" She said, "I do." When praying
[2:03:23] for her, eyes come open on the platform.
[2:03:25] She walked off the platform. What was
[2:03:28] it? The faith that was once delivered to
[2:03:30] the saints operating in a blind woman.
[2:03:33] You say, "Preacher, what are you getting
[2:03:34] at?" I'm saying this man, woman, child,
[2:03:37] preacher, deacon, trustee, Sunday school
[2:03:39] teacher, lay member,
[2:03:42] the faith that was once delivered to the
[2:03:44] saints is operating in this building
[2:03:47] tonight.
[2:03:49] God has sent down his faith, his power,
[2:03:54] and faith is power.
[2:03:58] &gt;&gt; I wonder tonight here on the on the
[2:04:00] brink of a new year, I wonder how many
[2:04:02] could say this with me. Lord, renew our
[2:04:05] faith.
[2:04:08] See, see, faith has a long range vision.
[2:04:13] Faith ain't looking at what is right
[2:04:15] now, but it's looking at what will be.
[2:04:19] Reb said, "Look, faith works in the
[2:04:20] realm of the spirit and God." I want to
[2:04:24] I want I want to I want to leave you
[2:04:25] with this and take this into the new
[2:04:26] year.
[2:04:28] Faith is the power.
[2:04:30] Will you remember this? Faith is the
[2:04:33] power to power out of the darkest hour.
[2:04:38] Faith is the power to power out of the
[2:04:44] darkest hour. Won't you stand to your
[2:04:46] feet with us tonight?
[2:04:50] God wants to send the Holy Ghost.
[2:04:54] God wants to bless his children.
[2:04:56] Reverend M said, "Oh," he said, "Here it
[2:04:59] is." He said, "The pillar of fire is
[2:05:01] here.
[2:05:03] He said, "Now, he's here to change."
[2:05:10] I I want to say something to you
[2:05:11] tonight, and I I want to I want to I
[2:05:14] want you to catch it, okay?
[2:05:18] You got to learn to appropriate faith
[2:05:22] in your situation.
[2:05:25] Is that Is that okay?
[2:05:27] See, people say, "Well, you preachers
[2:05:30] get up there and preach like you never
[2:05:31] have any troubles and you never have any
[2:05:33] struggles. You never have any problems."
[2:05:34] No, it's because you got to learn to
[2:05:38] appropriate the faith you're contending
[2:05:40] for.
[2:05:42] See, there there's been times any
[2:05:44] preacher that preaches the gospel
[2:05:46] contends for the faith on a on a regular
[2:05:48] basis.
[2:05:49] But there's times you got to appropriate
[2:05:51] it in your life,
[2:05:53] &gt;&gt; in your situation.
[2:05:55] And see, when you begin to appropriate
[2:05:57] that faith, that's where the power comes
[2:06:00] from.
[2:06:01] &gt;&gt; See, it don't come from because of who
[2:06:03] you are or what kind of ministry you
[2:06:05] have or who you No, it comes from the
[2:06:07] ability to say, "Lord, this is your
[2:06:09] word. I've got the deed. I've got the
[2:06:12] I've got the deed to to strength. I'm
[2:06:15] going to move into strength.
[2:06:17] I've got the deed to joy. I'm going to
[2:06:19] move into joy. See, brother Ram stands
[2:06:22] there and he says this. With all the
[2:06:24] faith that I have that's in you, Lord,
[2:06:27] that you have given me, I give to them.
[2:06:31] And as your pastor, your brother, with
[2:06:32] what faith I have, I've asked God to
[2:06:35] place it on you. This is this is my
[2:06:37] prayer for every believer in this
[2:06:38] building for the new year. I've asked
[2:06:41] God to place it on you. And I believe
[2:06:43] that I'll receive what I've asked. Now,
[2:06:45] if you will believe it with me, with
[2:06:47] what faith I have, I give to you for
[2:06:52] this hour. And now, in the name of Jesus
[2:06:55] Christ, the son of God, renounce your
[2:06:59] affliction.
[2:07:01] Renounce your sickness and say to it,
[2:07:05] you have to go cuz you have your faith
[2:07:08] plus my faith with the power of Jesus
[2:07:11] Christ whose omnipresence is here to
[2:07:14] vindicate it and prove that he is here
[2:07:17] and he will make you well at this time.
[2:07:21] &gt;&gt; Such as I have give I unto thee.
[2:07:27] I wonder tonight how many can testify
[2:07:29] that in 2025
[2:07:31] the faith of God is what brought you
[2:07:33] through.
[2:07:36] &gt;&gt; Appropriating the faith of God will take
[2:07:40] you through 2026.
[2:07:42] &gt;&gt; If there's a 27, it'll take you through
[2:07:44] that year. I don't know. I've been I've
[2:07:47] been preaching, watching that service
[2:07:48] since I was 14, 15 years old. And I
[2:07:50] don't think there's been one go by that
[2:07:52] I haven't stood on a platform and said
[2:07:54] these words. Now, if the Lord would have
[2:07:57] come down at the end of last year and
[2:08:00] showed you everything he's going to go
[2:08:01] through, Brother Wesley and showed you
[2:08:04] this day and this day and this week and
[2:08:05] a little break here and you go through
[2:08:06] this, a little break there, you go
[2:08:07] through and he showed you the whole year
[2:08:09] of 2025.
[2:08:12] Would you be standing here tonight?
[2:08:15] Be a nervous wreck.
[2:08:18] But when you put your faith in him,
[2:08:20] &gt;&gt; it don't matter what the year holds.
[2:08:23] &gt;&gt; You're walking in the faith of God. And
[2:08:27] everything you go through, you're coming
[2:08:29] out of it.
[2:08:30] &gt;&gt; Listen, I believe tonight the power of
[2:08:32] God is right here in this building. You
[2:08:34] love him tonight.
[2:08:35] &gt;&gt; Let's bow our hearts together. Heavenly
[2:08:37] Father, Lord, these are your children.
[2:08:40] This is your word.
[2:08:42] Lord, we're not here to say anything,
[2:08:44] Lord, that would just make us feel good
[2:08:46] or just excite us, but Lord, we're here
[2:08:49] to preach your promises, to preach the
[2:08:51] uncarchable riches of Jesus Christ.
[2:08:54] Lord, you've given us untapped
[2:08:56] resources.
[2:08:57] Now, Father, I believe right here
[2:08:59] tonight, the faith of God is living. I
[2:09:03] don't believe it's dead. I don't believe
[2:09:05] it's in a tomb, but Lord, I believe by
[2:09:07] the preach of the gospel, by the blood
[2:09:10] of Jesus Christ, that appropriate blood
[2:09:13] that's been appropriated to every life
[2:09:14] and to every heart. Lord, I believe the
[2:09:17] faith of God is alive and well in these
[2:09:19] believers. And Lord, I pray for them
[2:09:22] this this evening, Lord, as we're coming
[2:09:24] to the close of an old year. And Lord,
[2:09:27] we're facing a new year. Father, we
[2:09:30] don't know what next year holds. We
[2:09:32] don't know what tomorrow holds, what a
[2:09:33] month from now holds. But Lord, there's
[2:09:36] one thing we can testify that Lord, we
[2:09:39] know who holds the next year.
[2:09:42] Lord, we know who holds the next second.
[2:09:44] We know who holds the next hour. Now,
[2:09:47] Father, I pray the power of the Holy
[2:09:49] Ghost right now would settle over every
[2:09:52] heart, every life. Lord, if there be one
[2:09:54] that's been contending and they've not
[2:09:57] been appropriating, Lord, may this be
[2:09:59] the night of transformation, Lord.
[2:10:02] Father, may the preach of the gospel,
[2:10:04] may the preaching of the blood of Jesus
[2:10:06] Christ. May the may the revelation
[2:10:08] that's been made known in our hour has
[2:10:11] moved us from nothing to everything.
[2:10:14] Lord, has taken us as and made us the
[2:10:17] possessors of all things. Now, Father, I
[2:10:19] pray that faith would rest in every
[2:10:21] heart. Lord, your word is true here
[2:10:24] tonight. And Lord, I pray you give every
[2:10:26] one of my brothers and sisters strength
[2:10:28] in this new year. Father, may they may
[2:10:31] this be the year they move into every
[2:10:33] promise. For Lord, the promises are
[2:10:36] moving ready. There's nothing to be
[2:10:38] done. They don't have to be repainted.
[2:10:40] They don't have to be reframed. They
[2:10:42] don't have to be restructured. The
[2:10:44] promises of God are ready. They're ready
[2:10:47] for the believers to move into them and
[2:10:49] to begin to live them, to begin to enjoy
[2:10:52] them. Father, if there be one here
[2:10:54] tonight that's never moved in the divine
[2:10:56] promises of God, may this be the night,
[2:10:58] may this be the hour that they move into
[2:11:01] it. In the name of Jesus Christ, I pray.
[2:11:04] We thank you for your mercy and your
[2:11:06] grace, Lord. We commit this old year
[2:11:08] into your hands. And Father, we open in
[2:11:11] just a few hours a brand new year, a new
[2:11:13] chapter. If you give us time and breath
[2:11:15] to live into it, Lord, we thank you for
[2:11:18] it. Lord, go before us in Jesus name we
[2:11:21] pray.
[2:11:23] Oh,
[2:11:25] believe.
[2:11:27] Will you help me sing that, Brother
[2:11:28] David?
[2:11:31] &gt;&gt; Believe
[2:11:35] all things are possible.
[2:11:42] only.
[2:11:44] &gt;&gt; How many believers do we have here
[2:11:46] tonight?
[2:11:46] &gt;&gt; Oh Lord,
[2:11:49] I believe.
[2:11:52] Lord,
[2:11:54] I believe.
[2:11:58] &gt;&gt; All things
[2:12:00] are possible.
[2:12:02] &gt;&gt; Oh yes,
[2:12:06] &gt;&gt; Lord. I believe. I'm a believer. Lord,
[2:12:11] I believe.
[2:12:15] &gt;&gt; Lord,
[2:12:17] I believe.
[2:12:21] All things are possible.

[2:12:33] you. Happy new year. May the blessings
[2:12:36] of God rest upon you this year. heard

[2:12:45] singing only believe and he stopped in
[2:12:47] in a watch night service and he said now

[2:13:10] in every situation. When I don't feel
[2:13:13] like going to church, I'm going to
[2:13:14] appropriate the faith. When the devil's
[2:13:16] using old lines, symptoms, and vanities,
[2:13:18] I'm going to appropriate the faith
[2:13:20] [music] cuz I'm not just a contender.
[2:13:22] I'm an appropriator. Amen. God bless
[2:13:25] you. We love you for the love of the
[2:13:26] Lord. Thank you for your attention

[2:13:50] blessings of God are ready for somebody

[2:14:40] believe.
[2:14:44] All [singing and music]
[2:14:44] things are possible.
[2:14:49] Only. Can you sing it like this tonight?
[2:14:52] Lord I believe. Oh Lord

[2:15:00] Lord
[2:15:01] I [music and singing] believe.
[2:15:05] All things [singing] are possible.
[2:15:10] Lord I believe.
[2:15:16] Lord [music]
[2:15:18] I believe.
[2:15:21] Lord,
[2:15:23] I
[2:15:26] [music] all things are possible.
[2:15:32] Lord, I
[2:15:37] Amen. How many enjoyed that message
[2:15:39] tonight?
[2:15:41] Not just to contend for faith, but to
[2:15:44] appropriate the faith.
[2:15:47] You know, Brother Angie was preaching
[2:15:49] that I've had that conversation with my
[2:15:51] kids a few times when we go on
[2:15:54] vacations.
[2:15:55] They have all the the plans what they're
[2:15:58] going to buy and where they're going to
[2:15:59] go and do. And I had to give them a
[2:16:02] lesson. Well, you can't appropriate
[2:16:03] funds that you don't have.
[2:16:07] &gt;&gt; You know, see, I can appropriate what
[2:16:09] we're going to spend on food and what
[2:16:11] we're going to spend on toys and because
[2:16:14] I'm the one with the with the funs. I'm
[2:16:16] the dad. See, so you can't appropriate
[2:16:19] funds that you don't have. He got to
[2:16:22] preaching that. But when he read that
[2:16:23] quote, brother said, "There was no limit
[2:16:26] to the faith of God." I thought, "Isn't
[2:16:27] that something to the believer?" So you
[2:16:29] don't have to worry about what you're
[2:16:30] appropriating it for because there's no
[2:16:32] limit to the faith of God. Isn't that
[2:16:34] wonderful? As long as you can believe it
[2:16:37] there. I know the world tries to limit
[2:16:39] faith, but said they try to limit it by
[2:16:41] creeds. the denominations try to limit
[2:16:43] your faith saying this is for an apostle
[2:16:45] or that was just for a disciple or that
[2:16:48] was just for this one. But when Peter
[2:16:49] preached that message and and he and he
[2:16:52] said that this promise of the Holy Ghost
[2:16:54] was unto you and your children and them
[2:16:56] that are a far off as many as the Lord
[2:16:58] our God shall call. And brother said as
[2:17:01] long as God's still calling then there's
[2:17:03] still there's still faith to be had. It
[2:17:05] ain't it's an unlimited faith. I thought
[2:17:08] isn't that wonder? He says, "As long as
[2:17:09] God's still calling, then faith is ready
[2:17:11] for those that'll receive it."
[2:17:13] &gt;&gt; So if you're ready to receive it, then
[2:17:15] there's there's faith there that's
[2:17:16] ready. Amen. Because God is still
[2:17:18] calling.
[2:17:19] &gt;&gt; How many knows that that the Lord's
[2:17:21] calling? He he's still working. He's
[2:17:23] still dealing with hearts. And my here
[2:17:25] we are at the end of a year. Just a a
[2:17:28] tremendous
[2:17:30] a tremendous time that we've had.
[2:17:33] You know, I always take these times and
[2:17:36] reflect back on on where we come from
[2:17:38] and what God has brought us through. And
[2:17:40] here he's established a church here
[2:17:42] [music] in in Black Rockck, Arkansas,
[2:17:44] and and so many people from uh from all
[2:17:48] over different states, Virginia, and
[2:17:51] Ohio, and some from Tennessee, and some
[2:17:53] from Missouri, and just that that God
[2:17:56] draws us together to a place of worship.
[2:18:00] Amen. And it's not
[2:18:03] not just for the for the church, but
[2:18:05] it's the the the just the fellowship
[2:18:07] around the word of God and this this
[2:18:09] message that brother Andrew he he said
[2:18:11] we we we study [music] it too much but I
[2:18:14] don't believe you could study it too
[2:18:15] much and he knows you can't either.
[2:18:17] Amen. We just we we love it and we you
[2:18:21] know I'm going to ask you this. If we
[2:18:23] don't, who will?
[2:18:26] You know, one day, I mean, you can look,
[2:18:27] you look 20 years down the road, who's
[2:18:29] going to stand for this kind of faith?
[2:18:31] Who's if nobody's preaching it, nobody's
[2:18:34] believing it, nobody's and nobody's
[2:18:36] living it, then where would it where
[2:18:38] would it be? So, I thank God for those
[2:18:40] that are that are taking a stand. And
[2:18:43] you know, uh, I I believe that God is so
[2:18:47] unmindful of us and he he's he's blessed
[2:18:50] our church so much, gave us wonderful
[2:18:52] ministers that have preached the gospel.
[2:18:54] And and I want to say, God bless you to
[2:18:56] these men uh that take a stand upon this
[2:18:59] word. And and take the take the hits
[2:19:02] from people and the criticism that they
[2:19:05] take for, you know, saying everything
[2:19:07] you say is under a microscope,
[2:19:09] especially nowadays.
[2:19:10] Everything's public and you know, you
[2:19:12] can't just hide behind a a pull pit and
[2:19:14] say, "I didn't say it or I didn't mean
[2:19:16] it. You said it and you meant it." And
[2:19:18] uh and and it's public for everybody to
[2:19:19] see. And they take criticism and and all
[2:19:22] of this, but I say, "God bless you to
[2:19:25] the to the the ministers that stand upon
[2:19:28] the word of God." And I I I brother
[2:19:31] Andrew had mentioned something about it.
[2:19:33] Paul said this. He said, "How?" He said,
[2:19:36] "How shall they preach except they be
[2:19:38] sent as it is written? How beautiful are
[2:19:41] the feet of them that preach the gospel
[2:19:43] of peace and bring glad tidings of good
[2:19:46] things." Amen. And I believe that I I I
[2:19:50] appreciate these men that stand. Maybe
[2:19:53] if we could, and this may be an odd
[2:19:55] thing, but I'd like our ministers uh to
[2:19:58] come forward tonight and maybe just come
[2:20:00] to stand uh in the front of the pull pit
[2:20:03] if y'all would come. And maybe brother
[2:20:05] Andrew I'd like to come back and I just
[2:20:09] want the the church and maybe at this
[2:20:12] you know a time we don't really have an
[2:20:13] opportunity very often but but if you
[2:20:17] have a you know just to maybe come by
[2:20:19] and and shake their hand tell them you
[2:20:22] appreciate their stand and the uh the
[2:20:24] witness and and the labor uh to preach
[2:20:27] the gospel and to be uh to be ready
[2:20:30] whenever our number is called and amen.
[2:20:33] I've never been a part of a group of men
[2:20:35] that there was uh that there was less
[2:20:38] conflict. I mean there there there no
[2:20:41] nobody's fighting each other. Nobody's
[2:20:44] there's no competition of who preaches
[2:20:46] on Wednesday and who preaches on Sunday
[2:20:48] and [music] how long this one does and
[2:20:50] how long. We we don't have that here and
[2:20:52] we won't have that here. We we just love
[2:20:54] the Lord and we love the word and and we
[2:20:56] have real men that stand for the gospel
[2:20:58] and we have one cause and brother Andrew
[2:21:00] said it. He said, "We want to make the
[2:21:02] rapture." And that's our purpose. And
[2:21:04] these men, every one of them, I want to
[2:21:05] say while they're standing in front of
[2:21:07] you that I thank you from the bottom of
[2:21:09] my heart. I thank you for the [music]
[2:21:10] support and and for supporting our
[2:21:12] ministry here at the church. And and and
[2:21:14] these these brothers have put their
[2:21:16] shoulder to the wheel. And I couldn't
[2:21:17] express to them enough how much I
[2:21:19] appreciate them and the effort that they
[2:21:21] put forth. And and I I just want to
[2:21:24] maybe just take an opportunity tonight
[2:21:26] if if uh if if the church would like to
[2:21:29] to Y'all want they're all gonna hate me
[2:21:32] later because these are some humble men
[2:21:35] that would never appreciate this and but
[2:21:37] I want you they always do [music] stuff
[2:21:39] for me and but brother Andrew was
[2:21:41] preaching that and I it just came on my
[2:21:42] heart. I want y'all to come by and and
[2:21:44] maybe just shake their hand and if you
[2:21:46] have something [music] you'd like to say
[2:21:48] thank you or something like that and and
[2:21:50] you can go ahead and take the
[2:21:52] opportunity [music] and uh we just we
[2:21:54] just appreciate these men of God. So, if
[2:21:57] you'd like to come, maybe just maybe
[2:21:59] just come on.
[2:22:23] I love you, Lord.
[2:22:28] For your mercy never fails me.
[2:22:31] [music and singing]
[2:22:33] And all my days
[2:22:36] I've been held [music] in your hands.
[2:22:40] From the moment that I wake
[2:22:42] [music and singing] up
[2:22:44] till I lay my head,
[2:22:49] I will sing of the goodness of God.
[2:22:58] All my life you have been faithful.

[2:24:51] [singing] fireers
[2:24:54] in the darkest night. You are close like

[2:26:04] the worshippers arise.
[2:26:10] Let the sons [singing and music] and
[2:26:12] daughters sing.
[2:26:16] Yes, I'm surrendering my all.
[2:26:31] Oh yes, my [singing] Lord, let the sons
[2:26:34] and daughters sing. [music]
[2:26:37] [singing]
[2:26:39] Yes, I'm surrendering my all.
[2:26:44] Oh my lord, I surrender to the king.
[2:26:50] Father, I see that you are drawing
[2:26:54] a line in the [singing] sand.
[2:27:02] [music]
[2:27:05] Come,
[2:27:06] let it live in [music and singing] me.
[2:27:09] This is my prayer.
[2:27:12] This is my plea that the worshippers
[2:27:16] arise
[2:27:28] to bring my own
[2:27:35] king in the worshipers.
[2:27:42] Let your son [music]
[2:27:56] [music] to the king
[2:28:01] louder
[2:28:05] as the seas of every [singing and music]
[2:28:07] nation are awakening to Sing from our
[2:28:12] hearts there comes an end.
[2:28:16] Hear the praises [singing] ring. This is

[2:29:29] What a what a meal.
[2:29:32] There's nothing like the revealed word
[2:29:33] of God.
[2:29:35] More so the ears that we've been given
[2:29:37] to hear and the eyes to see. Amen. We're
[2:29:42] a blessed people that God has given us a
[2:29:45] place to hear the truth and men of God

[2:29:50] truth, that stand for the truth. Because
[2:29:54] I see these men, not just in here, but

[2:29:58] truth. Amen. We're blessed.
[2:30:02] for each and every one
[2:30:05] and for their wives that stand with
[2:30:08] them. Because when God called them, he
[2:30:10] called the wives with them and they
[2:30:13] stand for their husbands and they take
[2:30:16] flack just as well as they do because
[2:30:18] when they see people fighting against
[2:30:21] their husbands, it it's hurtful.

[2:30:33] blessed. I can say that I'm blessed
[2:30:36] because God's given me this wonderful
[2:30:38] place to worship him in together with
[2:30:40] you. Amen.

[2:31:44] us in 26, Lord. And we're here to
[2:31:47] appropriate that, Lord.
[2:31:49] Father God, we're going to go from this
[2:31:51] place, Lord, and go from each other's
[2:31:54] presence, Lord. But God, that you keep
[2:31:56] us bound together by love's strong cord.

[2:32:06] these things, Lord. Lord God, you've
[2:32:09] done so much in this place, Lord. Lord,
[2:32:12] let us not take it for granted, Lord
[2:32:14] God, but Lord, that we exalt you in all
[2:32:18] things, Lord. Lord, and thank God, Lord,
[2:32:21] for brother Matt being here, Lord Jesus
[2:32:24] and his family, Lord, to be in

[2:32:28] things, Lord, and you know all of our
[2:32:30] needs, Lord. Father, and I ask you, Lord
