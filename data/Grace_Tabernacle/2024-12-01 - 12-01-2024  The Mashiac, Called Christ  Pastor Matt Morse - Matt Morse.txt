come together as a body of Believers God that you could use us in a mighty way and God we'll be careful to give you the glory for everything that's done and said we ask these things in the name of Jesus Christ we pray amen amen may God bless you this morning as you would take your Bibles I want to invite you to the book of Isaiah and we're going to read out of the 10th chapter and we'll start in the 24th verse so Isaiah the 10th chapter and the the 24th verse we'll give you just a moment a moment to get there and man how many loves the word amen we sure love the word of God Amen and and I we just want to see something in it all all all the time to allow God to bring Revelation to our hearts how many loves Revelation amen it's what'll give you power over the enemy when you know who you are and what you stand for and who the enemy is and uh it sure makes a it sure makes a stronger believer so I want to read from Isaiah the 10th chapter and we're going to start in the 24th verse the Bible says therefore thus sayeth the Lord God of hosts oh my people that dwellest in Zion be not afraid of the Assyrian he shall smite thee with a rod and he shall lift up his staff against thee after the manner of Egypt for yet a very little while and the in in indignation shall cease and mine anger in their destruction and the Lord of hosts shall steer up a Scourge for him in other words he would stir up a whip or a whipping a Scourge for him according to the slaughter of Midian at the rock of orb now here God as he's as he's telling the people what he's going to do he brings their mind back to the day of of Gideon when Gideon fought the great battle and what God done to the midianites at the hand of Gideon he said I will stir up a Scourge according to the slaughter of meting at the Rock in other words it'll be like it was when Gideon went down uh to the of the anointing and I would like to take from this this morning and speak a message on the Mesi called Christ the mashiach called Christ and we'll just ask you to take your seats this morning now as a reading out of the scripture of Isaiah uh here uh the Bible would tell us just to kind of lay a foundation of how that Israel here was in bondage to this Assyrian army this was a great a great enemy a great f uh this great Army had came through many nations and they would come to the land of Israel and the Lord as he's speaking of these things he would speak of the Yoke of bondage that there would come a time when this yoke would be removed or this yoke of Oppression would be removed off of their neck and and you realize that that that he's telling Israel that this yoke of bondage is a temporary yoke and there this this oppression it's a temporary thing and and and and to be able to understand the context of what uh is taking place in Isaiah the 10th chapter you'd have to go back into Isaiah 78 and9 and hear a few chapters and read the context of what's taking place and uh you you can see that that you realize that these were God's children but they were in bondage they were they were they were the the Sons and Daughters of God but yet they were in bondage and you say well if they were God's children why were they in such bondage to begin with and why would God have to come and deliver them and after all they were already uh given this Promised Land but this comes in a time where idolatry had become common in the place of worship and and throughout every uh land that would follow God it would be the land of Syria or whether it be the land of Israel or the land of Judah uh but but they would all idolatry had become a common part of the worship and matter of fact it was in the temples of God that when you went into the temple there was Idols that set around the temple and you know how it must have bothered God that he would look into the temple and here these Idols had taken the place of a of a real Godly worship and men had turn to other things and and the Bible would tell us that this bondage was actually Allowed by God as a judgment because of their sin of idolatry so so we see that they were in this bondage or this great Assyrian uh uh judgment that would come that God asked to use them you ever think of it like this that God would use an evil and a wicked Assyrian army to cause them to destroy the idols that Israel wouldn't destroy you know what that tells me it tells me if God can't find somebody on the inside that'll fix it then he'll bring somebody on the outside that'll fix it in other words that God wants somebody to have to have a clean place of worship this is the desire of God that that the place of worship would be clean that that they would worship God and God Alone that the idols would be removed from the people's hearts and and so here God would use evil to exact good isn't that an odd thought many would look at this you mean God would use an evil thing to bring good to his people but most certainly God does this we matter of fact you can read it in Psalm 76 David say surely the wrath of man shall praise thee and the remainder of Wrath shalt thou restrain in other word God will use evil to bring about good he will use he will use men he will he will use the the arrogance of men or the evil of men to bring about the very purpose of God and and but but what God is showing us is that it only lasts for a season so it only lasts until God would be able to fulfill his purpose and rid them of the idolatry and so you see what God is doing he's going to use something wicked and then God would bring judgment on the wicked one for doing the work that God allowed them to do you say you mean God I I don't want to put a uh damper on your thought of God on your do old grandpa version of God that people build God up as but but we find this pattern All Through the Bible that God would allow evil to come in and he would allow a wicked to come in to bring judgment upon people but then he would destroy the very one that he allowed to go in he would judge them for going in and doing it you you see that in Joseph and his brothers whenever they sinned against Joseph but God used their wickedness to further God's purpose and then he judged his brothers for the wickedness that they did you've seen it the day when Saul sinned against David and God God used it for his purpose but then he judged Saul for for for the acts against David you seen it in Judas when he sinned against Jesus but then a after God's purpose was fulfilled he judged Judas for the wickedness that Judas had so so we see this is something this is a pattern that God used so many times through the scripture we find God doing this very thing but the Bible says that God said but it will come to pass in that day that the remnant of Israel as such have escaped to the house of Jacob will never again depend on him who defeated them but they will depend upon the Lord the Holy One of Israel The Remnant will return the remnant of Jacob to the Mighty God so you see the very purpose of God was the REM the remnant of the Believers to return back to God this is this is God's purpose this is why God would allow evil or this is why God would allow oppression or he would allow this great this great uh wickedness to come upon the land it was to push them back to God it was to bring the purpose of God that they would come back to the to the Mighty God I thought my isn't it something that God used it and then when his purpose was fulfilled you'll find that this great Assyrian army here they were they had taken over the land of Samaria which was the capital of Israel the northern kingdom and and this as they had taken over this place the then the Assyrian King had got swelled up in his heart he said well we took them over let's go on down to Jerusalem and we'll do the same thing in Jerusalem that we done in Samaria and I I remember as the Assyrian King was said it like this he said he said I'll as I've done in Samaria and her Idols I'll do in Jerusalem and her Idols see there was a mistake that the king of Assyria had made as he recognized or he had thought that the idols were the gods of the the true children of Israel so he said well the idols in Samaria they didn't stop us and neither were the idols in Jerusalem in other words we destroyed the gods of Samaria so let's go to Jerusalem and we'll destroy the gods of Jerusalem but listen as he would go and and and get this build built up in his heart God said but I will punish the fruit of the arrogance of the heart of the king of Assyria and the glory of his hotty looks and I'll remove the Yoke of bondage and I'll lift the burden and there see because there was something in Jerusalem brother Joe that was greater than all of the idols there was something in Jerusalem that was greater than the gods of Samaria there was something in Jerusalem that was greater than the that great Assyrian army or the greater than the greatness of that King but in Jerusalem the Bible said there was an anointing see there was something there would caused them to be able to win this battle there was something there that would keep them from being able to fall although it looked like they would be in bondage and it looked like this yoke would be upon them and this oppression would be upon them and they would be destroyed but there was something there that would not allowed them to fall into the hands of the Assyrian King I thought my isn't it something that the Bible would say because of your anointing you shall be free because of your anointing the Yoke would be lifted because of your anointing this this would would pass from you now we realize that over time that this anointing that was in Israel this this greatness of God or this th this this uh the desire that they had to really serve God we saw that that anointing became lost over time now you how many believes this that in the Old Testament the the the things that took place in the natural of the Old Testament were spiritual types of things that would take place in the New Testament so many times in the old test when you see something taking place of the natural it's a type of something that's going to come spiritually so we fast forward a few hundred years and you'll find Israel had become this great place of worship here uh brother Wesley they through time we see that they had this Godly worship or this Godly anointing had become nothing but more than a tradition it it had the idols that were once there that that God had had hated and the the idols that were once there that he allowed wickedness to come in to drive the idols H those Idols they there may not have been Idols in the temple but they had been replaced with the traditions of men and so these the the men had built this up until the until church just became ritual and the temple had just become a a ceremony and and and it didn't matter what you did outside of that as long as you came to church on Sunday morning and you and you done your ceremony and you done your your ritual and you and you went through the motions and you recited what you had to recite then you could go out and it didn't matter what kind of life you had as long as you made the ceremony on the inside and that was good enough but what it did is it caused the Church of God to become formal and it caused it to become dead and and it caused it to become cold and the anointing of God had left out of the synagogue no longer was there this great anointing of God the presence of God was not there any longer but in this time there were still a few that desired the true anointing of God there was still a few in the land of of Israel that that their heart they were they were they were waiting waiting on an anointing of God they were waiting on the reality of a God that could still move a waiting on the god that could still part Waters and and the god that they could still open the Red Sea and they could still stay the mouth of lions a god they could still slay Giants that were a people that were waiting on a God that had an anointing and they were holding to a promise that this God would return they were holding on to this promise that one day that the anointing would return back to the Church of the Living God again and we find it during this time the Bible would tell us here as Jesus's Ministry begin to rise in Luke the 4th chapter you'll find Jesus as he went into the synagogue in Jerusalem there the Bible says he took a portion of the scripture out of Isaiah he said the spirit of the Lord is upon me because he ha anointed me to preach the gospel to the poor he has sent me to heal the brokenhearted to preach Deliverance to the captives and recovering of sight to the Blind and to set at Liberty them that are bruised to preach the acceptable year of the Lord in other words he is Anointed me to preach the year of God's favor so here there's coming a time that the favor of God is going to be upon the earth oh my here that that for so long that people had been under a spiritual bondage for so long they had been under the the this spiritual oppression where they they couldn't break through any longer they couldn't break through to God they were they were hidden behind the veil they weren't they weren't good enough in order to be able to meet God but here he said but he has anointed me to come and preach that this is the year of of God's favor Jesus said I was anointed to preach the gospel my is't it something you realize that the Old Testament would say it was a promise of God he said that when my word Goes Forth out of my mouth it will not return to me void but it will accomplish that which I sent so that means if he was anointed to preach a gospel then there had to be somebody that was going to hear it whenever he preached it see when God sends a message there's always somebody to receive the message that God sent now I want to look at this word anointing and find two places in the scripture if you look at these with me the first was whenever King Saul was called to be the king here he was about to go into battle and the Bible would say in 1 Samuel that Samuel he said he he said unto Saul the Lord sent me to anoint thee to be king over his people over Israel now therefore hearken thou unto the voice of the words of the Lord now notice why he would come to anoint him now remember in the Old Testament there was many that were Anointed with oil so it came in a time that that when one would come into the office of priest or the office of a king and many even even the office of a prophet when they would when they would come to this place many they were they would they would have to be anointed it was an oil of consecration in other words it consecrated them to that office or their Divine appointment that God had given them and so this is what this is what's happening in the days of Saul that the priest would say that or the prophet would say I'm coming to anoint you to be king so it was a literal pouring of oil over the head of them in other words it was to anoint them with oil it was an outward an act to to consecrate them to God but notice in this word anointing there's actually two different meanings the first it was as a verb it meant to anoint with oil but it also the word anointed means to be nominated or to be chosen for a purpose so here to be anointed it would mean it would mean that they had to be chosen so not only were they consecrated but they were chosen by God to be in that office now you notice as Jesus is identified in the scripture and I'm going to I'm going to jump right into this but as he as he was identified in the scripture notice how Jesus presents himself when he goes to Peter and he asks he says Peter who do you say that I am and Peter said I say that thou art the Christ the son of the Living God remember when he went to the woman at the well and the and he be to discern her heart and and at as as he would discern her life in her heart the woman said unto him she said I know when the Messiah cometh which is called Christ when he is come he will tell us all things now notice when she uses this word she actually uses the Hebrew word mashiach and other words she said the when the mashiach would come he would tell us all things so this word mashiach is actually referring to someone who is Anointed with oil which signifies their consecration to a specific role or a specific office so here this woman had recognized this now in the Hebrew Bible you realize that this term it was used to describe priest it or Kings or somebody that was anointed this was their this was their Divine appointment but over time this word the mashiach was not only used to speak of of a messiah there were many Messiahs because there was many that was anointed and the Messiah meant one that was anointed so this word mashiach was used to described many priests it was described to use many men of God and many many Great Men of God that were anointed for a Divine Purpose but over time as as as the longer they would go and waiting on this one that would be so anointed of God waiting on the returning of this great one that the term mashiach and it was no longer just used to describe any Messiah but it was used to describe the so it it had a greater meaning can I can I say it to you in a caral way this morning if you ask some of these young kids who who is going to be the next president then most any of these kids would tell you it would be Donald Trump see they they would how many y'all kids would would know that see so who's yeah all these young boys so if you say who's the president so well it's going to be Donald Trump but do you realize that that there's actually tens of thousands of presidents in the United States there's a president of every Association there's a president of every Club there's a president of of of major companies there there's presidents of universities but whenever this term is used alone if you don't specify that I'm talking about a president of a club or president of an association when you just say who's the president anybody would say well it's the highest office in the land so without any any more explanation you always it's always referring back to the highest office this is what this woman at the well was talking about she wasn't talking about the coming of a priest when she said I heard that the mashiach would come she wasn't talking about just one of these priests that may be anointed or the next one that came in the temple that would have oil that would anoint their head and they would be consecrated for the office she what she wasn't talking about the next king of Israel she wasn't talking about just a prophet that would that would be anointed but she said when the miach would come she was talking about Christ the anointed one she said his name Shall be Called Christ now notice here when she would speak this she this m called Christ she wasn't just talking about any anointed one she was talking about the anointed one Christ the anointed one she said the mashiach which is called Christ now that word Christ was the Greek word which was the Greek equivalent to the Hebrew word mashiach so she says the mashiach would come or the Messiah which you call Christ the anointed one and so here she's referring to the anointed one Jesus Christ this one that was chosen to come as a deliverer to this great nation or a deliverer to the world you notice how he would be the one that God had chose to be the Savior the one that he would chose to to be the he he was an anointed one brother Wesley he was a chosen one he was chose to bring healing to the Nations he was chose to bring Deliverance to Israel he he was chose to bring the gifts of God back to the life of a human being he was the chosen one so Jesus would stand up and he would say I was anointed to preach the gospel the spirit of the Lord is upon me he was anointed with the spirit of the father he said he has anointed me to preach the gospel to the poor I was anointed to heal the the Brokenhearted I was anointed to preach Deliverance I was anointed to recover the sight to the Blind and I was anointed to set at Liberty them that are bruised anointed to preach the acceptable year of the Lord see Jesus wasn't he wasn't reading from The Book of Luke like we read but he was reading from the prophecy of Isaiah this prophecy that was concerning the coming of the mashiach he was he was reading from this prophecy you realize this prophecy spoke of an anointed one that would be sent by God that had a specific specific role a role that no man would ever be able to fulfill a a role that could only be the Son of God he would he would come as one that that that was enlightened by the spirit of God he would he would bring the spirit of God Back To Human uh human beings again and you notice this is the this is what the Bible's prophesying of and here Jesus would go up before the synagogue and he would take the these crows of Isaiah and brother Joe as he would read this CR of Isaiah at the end of the reading he would say this day this scripture is fulfilled in your ears in other words the hour has come the wait is over all these things that have been prophesied through the years that that what you what you have been waiting on it has come to pass in this hour but you're living in the age of the Fulfillment of the prophecy of Isaiah and friends let me tell you what was written in the Scrolls of Isaiah what was a word in the Scrolls of Isaiah the very moment it came out of the mouth of Jesus Christ no longer was it just a word but it became an anointed word it was a word that was fulfilled it was a word that had power it wasn't in the mouth of anybody that would read it it was just a word in the mouth of those that would read it it may have been just a dead letter as many would pick up a Bible and they'd read as Paul would say the letter kth but the spirit giveth life without the spirit of God it would do nothing but when the anointing of God came that same word became an anointed word and because it was an anointed word in the mouth of Jesus Christ I feel like preaching this morning we may as well it's Sunday morning because it was anointed word in the mouth of Jesus Christ the Bible would call it gracious words when he would speak they would say it was gracious words when he went down to Galilee the Bible said when he spoke they said he speaks as one that has Authority and has power let me tell you because the word that he spoke was an anointed word it was so anointed when he went down there was a man outside of the the tomb that had been filled with so many Devils that they locked they got him away from the people but when the words of Jesus spoke to him and told the demon to come out out of him the demon had to come out because it was anointed for that hour it was an anointed word and he cast out you say well how did a demon come out of a man because he the word had the authority to do so because his word was an anointed word somebody say Amen his word how many believes that that the words that Jesus spoke was an anointed word his message it was an anointed message when he went into the tomb it was anointed when he resurrected on the third day it was anointed when he preached in the mountains it was anointed when he preached on the shores of Galilee it was anointed when he went out in the fishing boat and he spoke to them it was anointed when they hung him on the cross of Calvary his word was still anointed he went to the tomb anointed he resurrected on the third day it was still anointed when he ascended into Glory it was still anointed when he descended in the in the in the the office of the Holy Ghost on the in the the the book of Acts on the day of Pentecost it was still anointed and that same word that was anointed fell Upon a man named Peter and turned a man that was a coward into a real gospel preacher when he came back out he preached the word of God and the Bible says whenever Peter preached there was 3,000 Souls that were W to the kingdom of God why cuz the same word that he heard had came alive in his heart and the anointing that was on the word that Jesus Christ spoke was upon the man named Peter and when he spoke that word 3,000 Souls were won you say why were they won to the kingdom of God because his word was anointed when he went down with John to the gate beautiful they found a lame man you know what he did he preached a little faith message to the man and the man got up and walk you said why' the man get up and walk because his word was anointed it was an anointed message see God anoints men to do great things he anoints women to do great things God anoints us to do great things to bring about God's purpose do you realize that there's anointed men and women among us God anoints us to do great things we've been Anointed with a message to be able to speak to bring Faith you realize I you know there was something I always thought fascinating that that brother Billy Graham said one time he said the message I preach has not changed from the is late in his ministry he said my calling is to preach the love of God and the Forgiveness of God and the fact that God does forgive us see he here was a man that had a calling of God a gift of God in his life and he was anointed for that purpose how many how many believe that I I believe brother Billy Graham to be a man of God I believe he done great work for God he he he he was he he he done his his calling of God he he was no different than the angels that went down into Sodom that called lot and his family out of Sodom that they would be saved before the time of judgment he was a great man of God and then but I love how when he when he spoke this he said my message never changed another word he abided in his calling so God gave him a calling anointed him for a calling and then he abided in his calling many great men and women they they've been given a calling of God they get something specific to do but but but he abided in his calling but I love it he said my message never changed is that the way it ought to be my message never changed you know I think many today can I just preach a minute I think many today have forgot what the message is I think they've forgotten what it is you know you remember the story about the little boy that went on the race they told him well that here's a race all the boys are going to go and you got to go through this whole obstacle course and when you get down to the end of the course then you just give the password and they'll let you in whoever first one down to the end of the course gives the password you get to go in so the boy began to train he trained so hard that he could be the one to make it to the end brother Wesley he worked out so good until he was the fastest and the best came out to the race that day M when they let it go there wasn't nobody could catch him he went around every obstacle went over every Hill jumped every barrel went through every every maze that he had to go through when he got to the end of the door there was a the lady standing there and she just looked looked at him he said I I'm here what's the password oh I forgot it in all my training he forgot what it was but my isn't it is't that a good story to think what would it be like to get all the way to the end of the the trial and the end of the obstacle and the end of the great race and forget what the message even was is it something I think that has been lost that that many has forgotten him but I thought what a sad thought it is to get to the end of our race and forget the message that Jesus gave us many have forgotten it but let me just remind you this morning John 1 John 3:11 John said this is the message that you have heard from the beginning that we should love one another and friends I've got news for you it's the same message today this is the message that you have heard from the beginning that we should love one another not as Cain who was of the wicked one that slew his brother is't that the way it is in the world today everybody wants to slay one another Well slay this one cuz they don't see it the way I see it or slay that one cuz they don't believe the way I believe he said but slay Cain would slay his brother because Cain was of the wicked one he said why did he slay him because his own Works were evil and his brothers were righteous he said but Marvel not if the world hates you for we know that we have already passed from Death unto life because we love the Brethren that's how you know you passed from Death un life is that you love the Brethren and he that loveth not his brother abideth in death that we love one another think about it I think people have got the wrong message I do I think people have got a hold of the wrong message I think somehow in their minds that they they have built up the wrong message that that that that today it's about something else but friends I've got news for you it's still about the same thing I'm going to tell you something that most pastors won't tell you and I and I know our church is a growing Church there's a lot not here this morning but ever since we started there there's new people that come here every month and I thank you for having enough confidence in in the ministry that that you would come to to be fed spiritually but friends I've got news for you let me just tell you from my heart this morning that coming to this church ain't never going to save none of us being a member of this church ain't never going to save nobody you can come here all the days of your life it'll never get you anywhere with God that is not what's going to save you you can say well I'm going to be a part of Grace Tabernacle but it'll never save you it'll never give you eternal life pastors don't like to say that but it's the gospel truth being a member of this church never saved anybody being a part of this church never saved anybody calling me your pastor it'll never save anybody but there ain't one place to find Salvation and it's at the cross of Calvary where the blood of Jesus Christ is Flowing down from calvary's Cross where he poured his Blessing out upon human race and beneath the blood of the Lord Jesus is where salvation is found it ain't found in a church building it ain't found in a Baptist it ain't found in a Methodist it ain't found in Church of Christ it ain't found in Grace Tabernacle it ain't found in no man or no name that's been made by any man but it's only found in one and his name is Jesus Christ that's the message of the hour Amen brother it don't matter what you think it don't matter what man does you think about what men have done men have built churches and put their beliefs between people and God and put Creeds between people and God but you know it's what what happened when Jesus came brother Joel when he came to the Earth he found precious people trying to find Salvation in the church I wonder how when he came there you realize what they found when he found precious people they were looking for salvation but what they found instead is they found ceremonies and rituals they found those that were pouring out water over their hands and sisters in front of the in front of the pull pits and here their their garments wearing clothes a certain way washing washing the plates and things they had all these ceremonies but they never got salvation they never got salvation what is salvation it's Deliverance they never got deliverance from it it was it was a ritual it was a ceremony and I often wonder if Jesus came today what would he find if he came to every church and he visited every church this morning what would he find in there would he find it a place of ceremony or a place of ritual or a place of formalism or would he find it a place that had the anointing of God would he find it to be a place where you could find Salvation I thought my most of the time he it would be just about the same people are going to churches they're looking for salvation but instead they're getting a bunch of things to recite that men have made but friends that ain't what we need this morning we don't need something to recite what we need is the Holy Ghost back in the church again we need the power of God we need a church that's based on the new birth and the real Bible Holy Ghost I know I know you realize that most of Christianity Today brother Wesley they follow after man-made religions and man-made thoughts and and these men that built up their their great images to them but do you realize that we can't follow that and ever find God we're not looking to follow after that what we need to do is to get back to the Bible get back to a Bible Holy Ghost as anybody believes that this morning get back to a Bible move of God get back to Bible healing back to Bible salvation back to Bible deliverance we got a man to follow and his name is Jesus Christ I think we ought to get behind him because he was anointed to preach the gospel he brought an anointed word 2,000 years ago and that same word is still alive this morning you said well how do you follow him brother Matt let me just tell you you follow Jesus by following his word that's what John said he said in the beginning was the word and the Word was with God and the Word was God and the Word was made flesh and it dwelt among us the logos of God it was made flesh and it dwelt among Humanity to see so to follow him would be to follow his word this word this anointed word was so great that even Jesus himself that was given the power to judge he said I don't come to judge you but it's my word that will judge you when I'm gone see because it was an anointed word the word of God is what we're looking for that's what we're after but do you realize that to follow the word of God it would come with a ridicule or persecution it's not always the easiest thing Jesus said this to the disciples before you make this great decision to follow the word he said You shall be hated of all men for my name's sake but he that endureth to the end shall be saved they'll hate you they'll make fun of you they'll persecute you you remember the sermon that Jesus preached on the sermon on the mouth one it said to be the greatest sermon ever preached it was the greatest uh words that were ever written it was such a great thing that Jesus said but the Bible says that whenever he preached this they marveled that he preached as one with authority that same word but you realize that he preached on on that day brother Mark it still has Authority it has authority over every sin it has authority over the devil it has author authority over hell it has authority over sickness it has authority over our thoughts this morning and you think about about when Jesus would stand up there and give that great message do you realize that if Jesus went and he stood in pull pits today and he preached that same message most the people would get up and walk out they wouldn't even want to hear the the most fundamental sermon that Jesus preached matter of fact people skip part of it parts of it when they read it because they don't like what parts of it says but it was the sermon on the mouth and it was anointed it was anointed of God it may have been some part it may have been hard it may make half the people mad but but he preached it because he was anointed to do so and it didn't matter if it made people feel good or feel bad it was still true it didn't matter if they believed it or they didn't believe it it was still powerful it was bold it corrected wrongs but it revealed truth many men they sit around and heard it and they reviled against him because of the words that he spoke but it was still truth can you imagine sitting there that day no wonder they hated him that's right can you imagine sitting there and hearing as Jesus would walk up on this mountain the multitude would gather around him and the disciples would come up by him and he would sit down on the top of this mountain and begin to speak to them do you realize in that day that these people they were all considered little people they were considered people they were a spiritually oppressed people they were they weren't great like the priesthood the priesthood they were special people they because they had the robe just right they were special because of their natural lineage they were special because they come from the lineage of Levi and my they they could trace all the way back to Father Abraham they were a special class of people and the rest of them were just peasants that put money in the synagogue in the pot to help take care of the bills and and help their help them to have a better kind of a living this was this was what was going on when Jesus went up on the mountain to preach and can you imagine the the hatred that took place in the synagogue in the in the lives of the Pharisees when Jesus began to speak and he would talk about how an ordinary man could obtain what what what this supposedly righteous man told them they could never obtain in other words that the ordinary man could be more righteous than the man that was deemed righteous the ordinary man could be more righteous than the man that was supposed to be a priest here Jesus come he mixed it all up because he's talking about how that they become formal and it was just a tradition but the life of God was no longer in it and he began to talk about the condition of the people and these religious spirits that that had corrupted them and held them and the Bible says as they gather gathered around him can you imagine sitting here this morning can we do we have we have a minute it's still a little bit early can you imagine sitting there this morning and hearing Jesus in the in this condition and here there was this great this great priesthood that was over you and you my you had to you had to Bow your head to walk by by because they were so much greater than you on but but when Jesus come and here they gathered around him and he began to speak to them here they're sitting on the mountain and he said but blessed are the poor in spirit for theirs is the kingdom of heaven Heaven I'd have shouted all over the mountain a poor boy from Arkansas that's enough to send me up and down the mountain blessed are the poor in spirit for theirs is the Kingdom of Heaven I didn't know any of it belonged to me he said but blessed are you for theirs is the Kingdom of Heaven blessed are they that mourn for they shall be comforted how many were sitting around him that day that were in mourning lost and never didn't have a way out brother Bobby had no hope but he said blessed are they that mourn thank you for they shall be comforted you Lord blessed are the meek for they shall inherit the whole earth can you imagine them little sisters that were sitting there those little women those little Meek women that they went in the been shunned out of the synagogues they wasn't good enough to be in and M couldn't even come in certain time of day couldn't go to certain places but all of a sudden they Meek as they were they remain Meek but when the anointed one begin to speak he said blessed are the meek for they shall inherit the earth Hallelujah I think there was some shatters on the hill Glory Hallelujah blessed are they which hunger and thirst after righteousness for they shall be filled Lord blessed are the merciful for they shall obtain Mercy blessed are the pure in heart for they shall see God Amen blessed are the peacemakers for they shall be called the children of God God thank you Lord my hear the wars religion had become such a great battle and who's right and who's wrong and who's free and who's bound but Jesus said blessed are the peacemakers for they shall be called the children of God and blessed are they which are persecuted for righteousness sake for theirs is the Kingdom of Heaven blessed are you when men shall revile you and persecute you and say all manner of evil against you falsely for my sake you just rejoice and be exceeding glad for great is your reward in heaven for so persecuted they the prophets which were before you my if they' persecute the prophets of old then what do you think they'll do today they'll persecute the believer today so they persecuted them that were before you but you are the salt of the earth they had never heard a message like this on they had always been called the dogs but Jesus the anointed one said but you are the salt of the earth man who you going Listen to listen to the to the to the Pharisee or listen to the anointed one he said you are the salt of the earth but if the salt has lost its Savor where shall it be salted henceforth it's good for nothing but to be cast out and trotten under the foot of men and then I love this next part these old nobodies you are the light of the world you're a city that is on a hill that cannot be hid my goodness neither can a man that would light a candle put it under a bushel but on a Candlestick and give it light unto all the house so let your light shine before men that they may see your good works and glorify your father which is in heaven now what a message from an anointed word of God you are the light of the world yes don't hide your light but take the bushel off and let it shine before me my you may not have much but what you have give it to the kingdom of God you may not be ble to do much but what what you can do it for the kingdom of God this same don't you realize this same gospel that Jesus preached is the same gospel today the same message that he preached is the same message today and brother Joe it still has the same power it has the same Spirit it has the same anointing brother John it has it's the same word and it still has the same promise it'll do the same thing that it always done and I thank God that there's still some Believers here just like they was on The Sermon on the Mount that stood down there and said that ain't nothing but the truth and though many would walk away from him but there was the disciples that followed Jesus that said Lord where would we go for thou Hast the words of eternal life many would turn away would you go also I have nowhere else I can go for thou Hast the words of eternal life the same promise that Jesus brought is the same promise for the church today how many believe that the same the same words that that sermon on the mouth it wasn't just for the disciples it wasn't just for the people of Israel but that sermon was for you blessed are the meek for they still shall inherit the earth blessed are the poor in spirit for theirs is the Kingdom of Heaven every promise of God it still belongs to you as a body of Believers I I remember Jack Co you know how I love to I Love The th those great men of God I remember Jack Co he was a great faith healer back in the 50s but Jack Co said one time he said you know it'd be like going into a restaurant he said when you open up the menu and on the menu it have a T-bone steak and you'd read you'd say I want to order a T-bone steak and the waiter would say well that was for a day gone by he said I just get up and walk out of the restaurant why would you put it on the menu if it wasn't for nobody here it was an anointed word when Jesus spoke it it's still the same anointed word today said I want a restaurant that I can get all of it I I want to be able to walk in and order anything off the menu there anything that's anointed for my hour I want to be able to receive it I don't want to go in and some waiter come by and say but you a have that that promise ain't good for you or you ain't good enough for it I want to be able to order off the menu that's what we need we need to be able to have a full menu that's what this is this is a Full Gospel Church we believe the whole gospel I want the whole full menu I I want every part of it I want from page to page from cover to cover I wanted the promises of God that were promised to me in this age I want them for me in my family that's what we need every spiritual man he needs something to be able to feed feed on it's the word of God how many believes it this morning I believe how many believes every word of it I believe the word of God every word of it although we may not always understand it although we may sometimes we may explain it wrong in our flesh but you know God is always he is always leading us and we're growing in Revelation and growing closer to God and growing closer to the the promises of God and I still believe that they're for you and I I don't believe the promises of God are for a day gone by I believe they're for us and I believe we have a right to it it's not just a written word we ain't just reciting a word but it's a word that's anointed for a season think about it we we have a word we have a message in this hour it's anointing for this season Jesus spoke it it wasn't going away he spoke it he said it it'll take you all the way into a Rapture he he went down into a grave that same message it was buried in a tomb but that same message resurrected and it's been Vindicated in this hour to still be alive the same word of God you think about it what good would a message of Noah do today although it's great for inspiration but what good would it do you if you built an ark in the middle of a field it never save anybody because it wasn't anointed for this hour you think about the message that Moses preached although it it was it was not our message although it was a type of our message but but still yet what good would it do if you went out telling everybody to come out of Egypt it wouldn't do you no good to call everybody out of Egypt that's not the message that we've been called to in this hour but it it was anointed for that hour isn't it something you see when you find something that's anointed for the hour that you live in it comes with a power it comes with an authority that's why they said his word has Authority and power because it was anointed in the hour that we live so see so in the days of Moses because the because Moses's message was anointed when he went into Egypt it had a power and authority to turn water into blood because his message was anointed he had the power to bring Locust upon to destroy the crops because it was an anointed message it it had the power to bring Darkness upon Egypt and it had the power to bring judgment and death upon the firstborn because it was an anointed message it had the power to part the Waters of the Red Sea you think about it the word that Moses spoke it was anointed For That season he said brother Matt well what was it anointed to do I'll just tell you I'll just skip to it the the message of Moses was anointed to bring Deliverance how many believe that it was anointed to bring Deliverance to the for the children of Israel from Egypt yeah it was anointed for that purpose you think about I think about how powerful this is it was anointed to deliver you ever you ever looked at the birth of Moses I know I got too long you ever look at the birth of Moses Exodus 2 chapter first verse the Bible said and there went a man out of the house of Levi and took a wife of the daughter of Levi and and from this Union of a man from the house of Levi and a daughter from the house of Levi from this Union was born Moses the deliverer I think this is too good cuz see the tribe of Levi how many knows what it was Levi was the tribe that was anointed for service it was the the the tribe that the priest who come out out of this tribe they would be Anointed with o they were The Keeper of the anointing and so here here in this in this tribe that was The Keeper of the anointing I thought my isn't something it was those set aside for service when an anointed husband met an anointed wife it brought forth Deliverance man that'll preach on when the anointed husband met an anointed wife they were both from the house of Levi it brought forth a it brought forth a deliverer or or or Deliverance I thought my isn't that the way it is today when Christ the husband of the church here it was an anointed word and he's calling to an anointed bride he's calling to in other words he's calling a people back to the word of God he's calling the church back to the word of God and when that anointed husband met that anointed church or that anointed bride it will bring Deliverance to them we're living in an age of rapture we're living in a Rapture Age We that that's why in this Rapture age we don't need to come out of Egypt we need to come out of leosia we need the revelations 18 that say come out of her my people and be not partakers of our sin it's a call of the people of God out of the world and back to the god back to the god of the Bible on come out of her my people be not a partaker of her sin that's the message that you hear today it must be anointed for the hour that we live in we're living in an age of rapture and our call is a Rapture message and that anointing you think about that anointing God has given to us we've been anointed as as Believers you think about it there's been a union between Christ and the church and because that anointed word has been married to that anointed bride you think about it then it brings Deliverance out of Le oysa and that's what will take her to her future home to her Heavenly bridegroom as the Bible would say you think about an anointed word of God that's been Vindicated any man that's born to be a Son of God he'll see God's message as sure as there's a in heaven you know why Martin Luther did it in the days of Martin Luther he saw the message for his age and he believed it John Wesley done it he saw the message for his age and he believed it and started a great Revival think of it these Great Men the Pentecost done it on the day of Pentecost when it came they followed just what Wesley done the same outpouring of the Holy Ghost that fell in the days of John Wesley and the days of Martin Luther is the same thing that fell on the day of Pentecost don't don't think that that Pentecost just started in 1906 on ausa street that ain't where it came from it fell in the book of Acts 2,000 years ago and every anointed man of God since that time has been anointed by the same spirit of God John Wesley found his Martin Luther found his the Pentecost found his but what about you that's right brother you have an ear that's anointed to hear you thinkk many in the days of Jesus and I'm going to close with this many in the days of Jesus heard and they believed but the the but the crowd still cried crucified isn't it something there were many that believed but the crowd cried crucified he was anointed to preach but they crucified him anyway you said well if there's anointing there'd be no persecution there's anointing there'd be no no that ain't the case not at all they crucified him do you realize to be a follower of Jesus in that day you'd have to be accounted as trash you'd had to be you'd had to suffer persecution you'd had to Bear the shame of the crucifixion no wonder they were hiding when he was crucified cuz they were men and women just like us yes sir and they suffered the shame of of the crucifixion and to be called you know you realize what an ugly thing that it was in the minds of the Pharisees for you to say that you were a follower of Jesus Christ it was an ugly thing to say that and to say that today to be a True Believer and say I just want to follow the word I want to follow the Bible I just want to be a real follower of Jesus Christ well you don't fit in in any in any group so it's the old ugly ducking in the minds of the Pharisee it's still an ugly thing because you just want to follow Jesus Christ you're not a part of the right Charter so you don't fit in but I just want to follow Jesus Christ you're not a part of the right group but I just want to follow Jesus Christ you're why you didn't you didn't go to the right school but I just want to follow Jesus Christ why you wasn't you wasn't Anointed with the with the oil you wasn't you wasn't ordained by the right man but I just want to follow Jesus Christ let me ask you who was it that ordained Moses when he went to the back side out of a desert it was the power of God that came down to a burning bush that took the word of God and began to speak it to his heart that he could write the first five books of the Bible he was anointed by God to preach the word of God and God still has men and women in this hour that are anointed by God to be able to stand upon the word of God and testify to a lost and dying world Amen that's the anointing that we need anointed you think about it even in the days of Jesus as anointed as the message was it didn't match the Theologian it was persecuted it was crucified and are you ready for it brother Charles his crucifixion I know this may this may shock some folks but his crucifixion was not a private crucifixion hello somebody come on I want you to hear that it'll mean something to you one day his crucifixion was not private it was very public it ain't no secret crucifixion when they went to crucify Jesus Christ and all those that followed him it was very public it was ordinances that were posted on the PO to identify who they were and if you find any of them bring them down to the jail cuz they're a bunch of Heretics and they've lost their minds it was very public it was publicized everywhere it was announced in the newsletters it was announced on the street corners it was announced at the post at the Judgment Hall where even a man named Paul or Saul would go down looking for a bill that he could take those Christians and put them in a jail cell because they wanted to follow Jesus Christ they didn't fit in the theologians they didn't fit in the Pharisees they didn't fit in Judaism they didn't fit in the synagogues but they were anointed to follow an anointed word a public crucifix you realize that's the same thing today yeah it'll never be private amen that's right brother it'll never be private it'll be very public to you think you think anytime a Christian gets in trouble isn't it something you let anybody from any church ever do anything and it's publicized across the world Across the Nation the the guy out there in the bar he can do the same thing it'll never be publicized that's right but it's there because the the Satan wants to shed light on the hypocrisy of Christianity to turn anybody from being a Believer and being able to follow Christ let people do crazy stuff and there's people all over this world that do crazy stuff but that's what they pick out and publicize never do the never does the media take some Revival or or a move of God and say you know God really came and there was many Souls that were one to the kingdom of God wasn't that a wonderful thing down there in Black Rock when they baptized 10 people that gave their heart to the Lord they don't want to talk about that yeah let's find something wrong with somebody that we can talk about that and make that make that why because crucifixion is public persecution is public you know what it didn't matter how public it was the Believers remain believers they went through they went through being crucified they went through being burnt with oil they went through being being burned at the steak brother Wesley they none of them ever cared they went and laid down their life for Jesus Christ and I thank God that there's still some Believers in this United United States of America that still says I want to be a Bible believer and I think we have a right to stand upon this Bible that that that this world may one day they may do away with it but they'll never take it out of the heart of these believers they may take every book they can burn every one of them they they they can do what they want but they'll never take it out of the heart of the believer because he was anointed to preach it and you was anointed to hear it we're anointed in this hour to preach the Gospel of Jesus Christ you think about it we we we we we we we can go back all the way to the Bible we'll find out that Moses in his day you think he he was not the only prophet in the day but there was also a prophet named balum you know the difference between balum and Moses is that balum was concerned about his position with an Earthly King and Moses was concerned about his position with a Heavenly King bam wanted to be approved of by Bao and Moses wanted to be approved of by God you know when bam went down he began to prophesy all the good things notice what BB did here as he would he would come and B would tell him he would take him to the bad parts of Israel he'd say but look at all the things that they' done wrong look at all this stuff look at all this carnal stuff he said see they had sides of them think about this they had sides of them that were not praiseworthy but in spite of their imperfections the purpose of God that works to election by his grace and not by works despite of their imperfections they had a cloud by day and a pillar of Fire by night they had a Smit Rock they still had a Brazen serpent they still had signs and wonders and they were Vindicated by God in God that's good why in spite of their imperfections you say brother Matt what's that mean that means you may have places in your life that are not praiseworthy I'm talking to somebody you may have pray places in your life that are not praiseworthy but in spite of your imperfections you still have access to Healing there's still salvation there's still the Holy Ghost there's still a place to find Refuge you're still Sons and Daughters of God in spite of your imperfections in spite of your places in your life that aren't praiseworthy you still belong to God won't you to stand to your feet this morning see if he was the Messiah the anointed one for that day that would come to fulfill the word of God to be a redeemer and the anointed one think of what God done with that one when he went into the grave on he was crucified but he raised again amen and if he done it with that body then what about his bride today that's anointed for this day she's already been raised with him in Resurrection because they are one we're flesh of his flesh and bone of his bone that's right so we were crucified with him persecuted with him resurrected with him on the third day brother Mark when he ascended we go with him you think about it we're a part of him the Bible said he's the head and we're the body that's right so just as much as Christ is the head so are we the body that's right right so if that body was resurrected and this is the anointed bride of Jesus Christ I'm not talking about the people in this building I'm talking about around the world but this is these Believers that that are followers of Jesus Christ all around the world many churches true hearts True Believers that just love God I don't care what name's on the door I'm talking about the name that's written in the heart of the believer they're followers of Jesus Christ True Believers that the anointed one for this day is the Bride of Jesus Christ and she's already been raised with him in Resurrection because they are one that means there ain't no enemy can hold you that's right no power can oppress you any evil or wickedness that's been released upon this world has only been only been for one purpose and that's to drive you back to God amen any wickedness any evil that's been released you feel like it's been released upon your life it's been done for one reason it's to drive you back to God why is this wickedness come upon my family why why are these evil things coming why we got such battles why are these trial so great is to drive you back to God Amen you notice what God does said but at the end of it when they found theirself back with him then he took and he brought judgment upon the evil he said now remove that yoke from off you can I read it again thus sayith the Lord God my people that dwell in Zion that's the Bride of Jesus Christ the new the the new Heaven and the new Earth that's those people that was there in the Book of Revelation can we say it that way a spiritual type my people that dwell in Zion be not afraid of the Assyrian or in other words of that great enemy yeah he shall smite thee with a rod and he shall lift up his staff against thee after the manner of Egypt but in a very little while yes th ignation shall cease and my anger and their destruction and the Lord of her hosts shall stir up a Scourge for him according to the slaughter of Midian at the rock of Orab and as his Rob is upon the sea so shall he lift up after the manner of Egypt and it shall come to pass in that day that his burden shall be taken away away from off his shoulder and his work his yoke shall be taken away from off of thy neck and the Yoke I love this part and the Yoke shall be destroyed in other word the very yoke that the enemy would use to bind you he said in a very little while I'll remove the power of the Yoke and destroy it and it'll never have no power over you any longer not that he would remove the Yoke he said the Yoke would be destroyed that it would never be able to be replaced amen their yoke I feel the presence of the Lord amen their yoke could be destroyed because of the anointing amen friends let me tell you what I see this morning I see an anointed people of God that have been anointed by the word of God in this hour the resurrection of Jesus Christ the spirit of God a true baptism of the Holy Ghost it ain't some ritual it ain't try to get people to speak in tongues and things like people make it out to be or some show but it's a real change in the life of a human being when the spirit of God comes into the heart of a of a human being it drives all of the things of the enemy out it'll take every Idol out of your heart all those things that you used to worship all those old spirits and things that you use to worship the spirit of God will make you clean of them God wants a clean house can I say it that way he wants a clean place of worship where people will worship God and God Alone where they'll look to Jesus Christ and he alone he said I'll never have no other God before me you can't ever put a god between you and God you can never put another man between you and God it's Christ and Christ alone oh look at the image that's before us this morning what's been lifted up in this hour is Jesus Christ and he's not lifted up on the cross many would take the image of the Cross of Calvary and they lifted up oh but do you realize a crucifixion or a picture of Jesus hanging on the cross that ain't what's been lifted up but it's a resurrected savior that's been lifted in this hour that's right he said and if I be lifted up I will draw all men unto me he'll draw them under the anointing of Jesus Christ that you might have power over every enemy you don't have to be bound but the Yoke has been destroyed amen thank you Lord desire yes my [Music] Lord I [Music] say all my heart heart heart I worship [Music]
