--- TRANSCRIPT ---

L-1 Good evening, friends. It's indeed a privilege to be back in this auditorium tonight, again. Trusting under the leadership of the Holy Spirit to bring to you the message of the Lord as He gives it to me for the upbuilding of His Kingdom, for the glory of His Church is our intentions of this meeting tonight. And we're happy to see the auditorium packed out the first night. So we just trust that the Lord Jesus will continue to bless us as we go on from night to night in the services of the Lord. Now, each afternoon they--they have a service, I believe, here. He said to me... Is that right Brother...?... That's to be two o'clock? Two-thirty. And it's an instruction meeting. And I believe the best that I understood just a little bit ago, I'm asking the one day during the meeting to go up to the Apache Indian reservation (I see some of them are in the meeting tonight.) to have another service up at the Apache reservation.

L-2 I'll never forget the meeting with the Apaches. And now we're trying to make a date for that. And they'll see the missionary and so forth at the in--from the Indian reservation to make arrangements for this meeting. Each afternoon and each evening we'll have services here, the Lord willing, until we announce what day it'll be that we'll be going up there. And now, we trust that all of you are on praying grounds and love the Lord with all your heart. That's the way to be. And now, to the many here, perhaps, are strangers, maybe your first time. How many has never been in one of our meetings? Let's see your hands, never been in one of our meetings? Just look at the hands. Isn't that...? Well, to them who has been in the meetings, we, and with myself, we certainly welcome you to the first service. And now, may the Lord bless you, and do something for you, and give you the exceedingly abundantly of His love and grace to you.

L-3 And now, I was going to begin the meeting to just merely come and have an evangelistic service. I have noticed so much in my meetings going around, that the phenomenal--phenomena of this way of the Holy Spirit moves in the meetings has been very strange to the American people, because that there's such a mix up among the American people: So many different denominations with so many different phases of which a way they believe. And they become so indocumated with their belief and--till they hardly know which a way to go. If there ever was a place that's really has become a mar--modern Babylon, it's America. I hope that it never touches the shores of Africa or any of those heathen countries. I hope that real hard Gospel teachers get in there for tho--those people.

L-4 Well, what causes these things to start up? Hungry hearted children of God, people hungering and thirsting for God. They see something, and away they go and make an issue out of it. There it is: separates brotherhood, tears up the church. But that's America. And I have said since coming back, that I would in the American meetings, to my many tens of thousands of precious friends that I value with all my heart, and some of the loveliest people God has in His Kingdom, I consider as my friends in America... Thousands and thousands of them the Lord has given me. And I do appreciate every one of them with all my heart. And then I thought, after crossing back and forth across the country, I had noticed that one of the greatest things--difficults that I have in my meeting... When I'm praying for the sick by the... The gift that the Lord has given me is not to heal the sick. I have no power to heal the sick. And I don't believe there's anyone else does. That lays in God alone. The only thing I can do is point you to the finished work of Jesus Christ Who paid for your redemption and your healing at Calvary. I don't believe there's anyone here to ever save a person.

L-5 Someone not long ago said, "For the glory of God, Brother Branham, I got a little girl here that's crippled, and I want you to heal her for the glory of God, then I'll believe you." And just so happened that there's was an infidel standing near. 55-0220E, Contend For The Faith, Shriner Temple, Phoenix, AZ, 107 min I said, "What more glory would it be for the little girl to be healed than it would be for a sinner to come to the Lord?" I said, "Here stands a man that's a absolutely an unbeliever, a perfect infidel. You save him, and I'll heal the child." I said, "For the glory of God... This little girl will go to heaven if she dies in that case. But that man can't go to heaven in his case. Now, for the glory of God you save him, and I'll heal the girl." There you are. See? It's all based on the finished work of the Lord Jesus Christ. If you was a sinner, you'd come tonight you couldn't be saved tonight. You would have to accept your salvation that was paid for you nineteen hundred years ago. See? Jesus saved you when He died. That's when He saved you. But you have to accept it when He knocks at your heart. Then you accept your salvation; you accept Jesus as your personal Saviour. He was wounded for your transgressions; with His stripes you was healed. You have to accept Him as your Healer on the same basis you accept Him as your Saviour.

L-6 If that isn't the Gospel, I--I don't know it then, 'cause all these years; that's the Gospel as clear as I know. There's no man could save you; he can only present the Word of God to you. That's the only thing he could do. It's God's written Word he could present it. You act upon what you believe, whether it's true or not. And then in Divine healing is the very same thing. There's no man could heal you. Even doctors don't claim to heal you. They can remove a cause, something that the senses can see or feel. But they can't heal, 'cause God's the only one can heal. We haven't got a doctor that can build a tissue. If he could, he could build an arm out like this that'd been cut off. See? He could--you could cut a place up and go in the doctor's office and he'd build up a tissue and you'd come back out perfectly brand new. You go in a doctor's office with a broken arm, he'd set it together, and mend it together, and heal it over, come back out in a few minutes, your arm be perfectly whole. You can't do that. The doctor can... If you got a place cut, he can sew it up. If you got a place broke, he could set it. But God does the healing...?... That's right.

L-7 So God is the Healer. And God is the Saviour. Psalms 103:3 said, "I'm the Lord Who forgiveth all thy iniquities and healeth all of thy diseases." So it has to come through God. And now we want to approach this my friend sanely, reverently, and Scripturally. It must come from the Scriptures. And if it's not in the Scriptures and the meeting is not carried on absolutely Biblical and Scripturally, then it's wrong. It's just some make-up, mythical, but not real. So it must come Scripturally. We must approach it sanely, and reverently, and faithfully to believe it.

L-8 Now, in the meetings as they go on, now I have noticed that many times people in wondering why that I can't get to no more than what I do. It's because of weakness, not weak physically. I'm, thank the Lord, very strong physically. And when it comes to a place of--of preaching or to what I... I guess I could preach three of four services a day and not pay any attention to it, as far as being weak. But one time of a vision will pull the life from me. Surely Christians can understand that. See? It's not me that does the work. It's you yourself. You're the one who does it, your faith in God. I just stand as His servant. And then, when your faith is built to a place till it pulls from--pulls God... And God only uses my lips to say to you what He would say. Do you understand?

L-9 When the woman touched the hem of the master's garment... Well, she thought in her heart, "If I could do that, I'll be made whole." And she slipped off out of in the yard. And Jesus turned around and said, "Who touched Me?" And the apostles was very much astonished, 'cause he said, "Everybody's trying to touch Him--touching You." He said, "But I perceive that I have gotten weak. Virtue's went out from Me, gotten weak." You understand? One person, gotten weak. And so he begin to following where that flow was coming from, and as He looked around, He found the woman. He said, "Thy faith has saved thee"; not, "My power has saved thee"; but, "Thy faith in believing what He was." For she said she believed what He was.

L-10 Now, the one--the one that smacked Him in the face when He had a rag around His face, and he hit Him on the 55-0220E, Contend For The Faith, Shriner Temple, Phoenix, AZ, 107 min head, said, "Now, you're a prophesier; tell us who hit you. We'll believe you." They felt no virtues going--he felt no virtue going there. It was unbelief. You must believe. "He that cometh to God must believe that He is." Now, you can come to God. How? There's only one Mediator. That's Jesus Christ. But the minister's sent to preach the Word. And you can hear the minister and come to God through the minister's message. While the minister's preaching the--the Word of God, the Holy Spirit that's in your heart will feed on the Word of God. You get what I mean?

L-11 Now, so therefore it's not... That what brings the weakness on. And it's for each and every one. Here each night... Every day we give out prayer cards, every day afresh, so everybody can get a prayer card to come. Whether you've come in, in the meeting or whether you've... But you must come for the afternoon service for instructions. The prayer card must be carried by the person who receives it. Because the person must first come to the meeting then have instructions before they can receive a prayer card, inexchangeable. So the person themself, not somebody that never heard of meeting, knows nothing about it come into the meetings, they'd never be able to receive healing, because they don't know how to do it. You must know how to approach God for healing, like you do with salvation.

L-12 Then again, that... It isn't a personal contact: The minister isn't to personally contact. That's one thing that's hurt the American people, and for my own ministry. They believe that they must have hands laid on them or something on that manner, because they've been taught that, especially among the Full Gospel people. The Nazarene, Pilgrim Holiness, Methodists, Baptists, so forth believes in the anointing of the oil. That's the way they've been taught. So they see something where you have to just look right and live, that's a little odd to them. In the foreign countries, one thing in the supernatural, the whole group believes with one--one accord (See?), because they're not indocumated with different things. They just see it and know it's got to be supernatural. They accept it to be what you say it is. They don't class it nothing else.

L-13 The Americans have mental telepathy, fortunetellers, mind readers. The Jews with their theology in that day, they said, "He's Beelzebub, the devil, the prince of them, the best fortuneteller in the country," all such as that. And that's the way they failed to receive Him. That's the way the American people are failing to receive it. But to them who really believe and approach it... No matter where you're at in the building, if you'll approach it reverently it'll speak to you. That's right. That's true. Try it and see if that isn't right, with a full surrendered heart to do the will of God, and promise Him that you will, and see what happens.

L-14 Now, I said I would go across the country. I never get a chance to meet my friends. 'Cause just as soon you meet someone when the anointing is there, well, there it is again not the person. Now, then at nighttime I finished before night comes. But I thought I would begin to...?... Ministers keep telling me, "Oh, Brother Branham don't." But in California in the Christian Businessman, after the Angelus Temple (I've got to be there a few nights.) Then at the Christian Businessmen God helping me. I aim to just preach the Gospel on basis of the shed Blood, and bring the people up, and just pray for them as they pass by. I tried that in my tabernacle a few weeks ago. Out of about a hundred and something people that come through the prayer line being prayed for, sixteen outstanding miracles was performed before the people left the building (See?), just by laying on the hands and praying. Sixteen, that's polio, and crippled arms, and twisted. Everything was performed.

L-15 This way, once in a while I'll get a question like that. Cause I just... Wherever I feel, I just call a few up to people up and here...?... May I see a person there and he be... Here's something wrong with this one. I can see it. But there's no need of telling them; there's not faith there for their healing. So I just don't say nothing, just go ahead. Here it is over here. And here it is here...?... But you... Until you see something that you're pretty sure that's going to be done, sometimes it'll speak to that person then. See? That's it. Now, for that... Upon the basis of that, it's the purpose for the healing... Faith cometh by hearing and hearing of the Word of God. That's first. Then after that, God has set in the Church apostles, prophets, gifts of healing, miracles, speaking with tongues, interpretation of tongues, and all those gifts He has placed in the Church for the, in other words, for the calling together for the edification of the body of the Lord Jesus Christ. 55-0220E, Contend For The Faith, Shriner Temple, Phoenix, AZ, 107 min God has set some teachers, evangelists, prophets, working of miracles, gifts of healing... All those things are for the perfecting of the Church. Just like the members all active in your body, not just at Pentecost, thirty-three years after Pentecost when the Christian Church was put in order. See? Those things which to continue then.

L-16 Now, come and pray with us. I love you. And I'm here with all my heart to try to help you, try to help you to make your home a better place to live, to make the community you live in a horrible place to do evil and an easier place to do right. That's the idea. That God would heal you, not just to show His power for healing. He doesn't have to do that. Look at the sunset; you can see His glory. Look at the trees growing. You can see His glory. Listen at His birds sing. They don't--they don't sow, neither do they--do they plant, but they... God feeds them. You can see the glory anywhere. But that your testimony of healing might be to the glory, that you might tell someone about it, that they too might believe on the Lord Jesus Christ as their Saviour. That's what it's for.

L-17 Now, in this blessed Word, talking with Brother Ballard, one of the--the chairman, I suppose, of the committee that has us here... We were talking a little while ago, just before coming to the meeting. And I'm going to try to rearrange something for a few nights. And I want you to pray for me. Now, this is the Word of God. I believe every word of It to be the truth. And now, before... We--we could open the pages like this, but it takes the Holy Spirit to open the Word to us. Because we're--we're--we're blind in a dark world, and only Christ can do these things for us. And so before we approach Him, let's... Before we approach His Word, rather, let us approach the Author of this Word and ask Him if He'd just open it up to us, that we as children can look into It quietly, sanely, and fundamentally. Will you do it while we bow our heads just a moment in prayer?

L-18 Our beloved Saviour, we are so happy tonight, because that we can say from our hearts, by the witness of the Word and the Holy Spirit, that You are our Saviour. For our spirit bears witness with Yours, that we're sons and daughters of God. It does not yet appear just what we'll be at the final wind-up, when this world is no more. But we know that we'll have a body like His, for we're going to see as He is. What glorious hope and with joy in our heart, how could we feel bad and believe that? That someday we're going to meet Him and see Him, touch Him. What would it be? And setting at the wedding supper, come, take His nail pierced hands, wipe the tears from our eyes, take away all suffering and sorrow, entering into the joys of the Lord that's been prepared since the foundation of the world. God, let every man and woman in here tonight lay hold on that promise, and believe with all their heart. And by believing so they receive Everlasting Life. For we ask it in His Name. Amen.

L-19 Just for a few moments. I want to read out of the book of Jude, just one chapter. And it's the 3rd verse of this chapter I wish to read for a Scripture reading just now: Beloved, I gave all diligence to write unto you of the common salvation, it was needful for me to write unto you, and to exhort you that you should earnestly contend for the faith which was once delivered unto the saints. May the Lord add His blessings to the reading of His Word. I'll just speak a few moments for this. And you pray with me that God will take the Word of God and by the Holy Spirit deliver it to every heart just as we have need.

L-20 Now, Jude here writing some thirty years after the--the first beginning of the Christian dispensation, the birth of the Lord Jesus. And the beginning after the issuing in of the first dispensation or the Christian dispensation, rather. Now, to make that clear, Luke 16:16 said that, "The law and prophets were until John and since then, the Kingdom of heaven is been preached." John preached for six months, his ministry. Then Jesus was introduced by him, and then he decreased, then Jesus increased, as he said.

L-21 Notice, Jude said here that he gave all diligence to write unto the church, that they should earnestly contend for the faith that was once delivered unto the saints. Now, that would... We'd want to think that that was our church. Us Methodists would want to think that's our church. We Baptists want to think that that's our church. We Presbyterians wants to think that that's our church. We Catholics wants to think it's our church. And we Pentecost wants to think it's our church. And every one of us wants to think that that's what our church is doing. 55-0220E, Contend For The Faith, Shriner Temple, Phoenix, AZ, 107 min Now, friend, there's always one logical, sensible, fundamental way to seek what they had: let's go back and find out what kind of faith they had. Then if we've got that kind of faith in our church, let's contend for it. That's the truth. That's the way to do it. That's really the Scriptural and the only basic way that I would know to approach this--the subject.

L-22 Now, notice it did not say, "Let us contend for the faith that was delivered to Israel in the wilderness"; "Let us contend for the faith that was once delivered unto the saints." And in order to be a saint, it had to be applied to the Christian dispensation. Because the word "saint" comes from the word "sanctified, the sanctified one." And if sanctification comes through the shedding of the Blood of the Lord Jesus Christ. Hebrews 13:12 and 13 said, "Jesus also, that He might sanctify the people, suffered without the gate." You see it? Saints then would have to be in the New Testament. Contend for that faith, because it was in the dispensation of grace and not under the dispensation of law.

L-23 Now, then the first One to introduce the message of--or the faith would be our Lord Jesus Christ. John just introduced the Lord Jesus, and Jesus was the product of what God intended for us to contend for. He was. The--the whole of the Christian faith laid in Jesus Christ, in our faith in Him. Now, if we can only understand what kind of a faith He taught, what kind of a faith He practiced, then we could see by that if the early church practiced the same thing. Then we should earnestly contend for that type of faith. For it's to commission to us to continue. Hold until He comes.

L-24 Now, the first thing we find that when Jesus was born, and we know the story until it comes to the place of His--His great miraculous works setting in, or when He begin to teach after His baptism. And if we'll notice, quickly closely that God was in Christ reconciling Himself or the world to Himself. The Bible said that God Himself dwelt in Christ Jesus." Jesus said, "The Father dwelleth in Me. So if you can find out what God thinks about mankind, you'd find out what Jesus said about mankind, and you'll know what the Father thinks about Me." Even the Father Himself on Mount Transfiguration said, "This is My beloved Son, hear ye Him." Don't hear nothing else but Him. Now, that... Then we'll have to find out what--what God's attitude towards... If we can find out through the life of Jesus Christ, what God's attitude was to the sinner, to the sick, to the prostitute, to the gambler, to the beggar, we can find out what God's permanent attitude is towards the same matters today.

L-25 For if He was God's expression, you believe that? God was expressing His attitude towards His fallen creation through the Lord Jesus Christ. He expressed Hisself that way. And now, I think Peter on the 2nd chapter, very well gives an example of what to think when he said there, "Ye men of Israel, Jesus of Nazareth, a Man approved of God among you by signs and wonders, which He did in your midst, which you yourself are witnesses... "See? Peter said, "Ye men ought to have known that this was God's message to the people." For God was with Him, giving out His message to the people and proving what His attitude was towards Adam's fallen race.

L-26 I think Peter explained it good to the church. I think Nicodemus gave a very good description of what the Sanhedrin thought of the Lord Jesus. Nicodemus, the man, the ruler who came to Him by night... Many people laugh because he came by night. But he finally arrived. That's the main thing. You who laughed at him, have you done as good as he did? He finally arrived there. He came by night, and he said to the Lord, "Master, we (Who? Who's we? The Jews, the Sanhedrin.) we know that Thou art a Teacher come from God, For no man could do the miracles that You do, except God be with him. We know it." But because of prejudice, because of church affiliation, because of superstition, because of lack of spiritual knowledge, they could not accept Him. "We know that Thou art a Teacher (We know it.) come from God for no man can do the things that You do, except God be with him." That well describes the attitude of the Sanhedrin to the public.

L-27 Now, notice we'll find out what Jesus presented. In the beginning of His ministry He wasn't a Man of great dress. He wasn't a Man to make Himself conspicuous, any different from any other man. He dressed so much like other 55-0220E, Contend For The Faith, Shriner Temple, Phoenix, AZ, 107 min people, He could walk among men and they didn't know Who He was. So if we was going to look for the right Jesus in Phoenix tonight, we could not look to a person that's dressed some different in a clerical way. He'd be dressed like an ordinary man. Is that right? He'd just walked among men. We couldn't looked for some great theologian and scholar, with some great amount of honorary degrees and so forth behind His Name, because He never had one.

L-28 Look at Nicodemus coming to Him. Nicodemus was a scholar coming to a Man that had no diploma. He was aristocrat coming to a pauper. He was an old teacher coming to the youth. See the difference? But when he come, he come with a open heart seeking the truth. You come that way. Just come the same way with a open heart seeking truth. "Seek and ye shall find; knock, it'll be opened; ask and ye shall receive." That's it. That's the basis that Jesus said to come on. Now, Jesus when He was here He--He was a humble ordinary Man, not so much as a brea--great fiery preacher. He said His voice was not even heard in the streets. He was just an ordinary man. But there was something about Him, that people realized that those things, qualities that was in Him was beyond the ordinary man. They knew it was.

L-29 Why, as they... And I've just said that He was God's example for all Christians. And He was God's desire. He was God's Gift. And frankly, in Himself He was God Himself, presenting the faith to the people. Now, we see Him... Oh, I just love this part here, to watch what He done. What did He do that was different? We notice in the first beginning of His ministry when He first started out, there was a man by the name of Philip got converted. So he goes out and finds Nathanael right quick, and said for Nathanael to, "Come, see Who I have found, Jesus of Nazareth, the Son of Joseph." Well now, Nathanael was aristocratic upright man, very much of a believer, and he turned around quickly, said, "Could there be any good thing come out of Nazareth?"

L-30 Oh, friends, you don't understand... Now, to some of you people that just want to go to a big church because it's a big beautiful building and wouldn't come to a place, regardless of how much you thought God was there, just because it's amongst a poor bunch of illiterate people, let me show you how wrong you are. Did you realize that only through death can life come? Do you know that out of corruption comes life? Did you know even your natural life comes out of corruption? Everything you eat is dead substance to bring blood cells? If you eat a steak tonight, a cow died so you could live. If you eat a potato, the ta--potato died. If you eat kale greens, it died. Something has to die to produce life. That's the reason you cold formal intellectual faith, you can never receive Jesus Christ. You've got die in order to be borned again and live again, going beyond (See?), not of corruption.

L-31 Philip said--or Nathanael said, "Could any good thing come out of Nazareth?"...?... Now, I think Nathanael asking that question, Philip gave him the best thing that could be given, said, "Come and see." Don't stand off out here and criticizing now, just come over and find out. You come over yourself. That's the best way it is. That settles it, doesn't it? Come, see for yourself, very good answer. So what happened? Nathanael being honest hearted, he followed Philip. And when he come... Oh, so much could be said here, but--but for the cause of time.

L-32 Look. When he came, and he came up into the line, or into the audience. Might been in the prayer line, it might have been out in the audience, out there somewhere. But when Philip walked up, "I want to find out now if I can introduce Nathanael to--to Jesus." And I can see Nathanael as mentally thinking. He walked up in the audience, and the first thing you know, Jesus standing there talking, praying for the sick, or whatever He usually His procedure was. About eighty percent of His ministry was praying for the sick. So I suppose He might've been praying for the sick, having a lot of people coming by praying for them.

L-33 And all at once I imagine that Nathanael said, "Well, that Fellow is just a little different from the ordinary scribe. He doesn't try to dress so fancy. And He's just an ordinary looking man." Maybe... "I like His talk." And when he got to thinking those things, Jesus turned around, looked at him, and said, "Behold, an Israelite in whom there is no guile." In other words in the Christian, English version of it today, He would say, "Behold there is a believer 55-0220E, Contend For The Faith, Shriner Temple, Phoenix, AZ, 107 min who's honest." Well, Nathanael thought, "Now, wait a minute; I just come from over here on the other side of the mountain." Maybe started day before. "Now, Philip my friend who got converted, come over and told me. Now, here I am standing here, and the man tells me I'm a believer. And I'm a truthful man, which that's right." He said, "Rabbi, You mean me? How did You know that? How do You know anything about me? I'm a stranger to You." Now, what was Jesus doing? Introducing to the world what God wants the world to have, the faith that Jude said to contend for.

L-34 Well, I can imagine some of them standing around, say, "Uh-huh. He read his mind. That's what he did." See? He said, "How did You know me?" Now, look how impossible this would be nearly. Jesus said... Now, he was wondering in his mind. "It couldn't have been telepathy." So he was wondering then, "How did that Man know that?" And Jesus said, "Before Philip called you when you was under the tree over there, I saw you." That's settled it. He said, "Thou art the Son of God; Thou art the King of Israel." That settled it.

L-35 I can imagine the Pharisees saying, "Now, there He knew that. Now, there's a trick in it somewhere. There's got to be something there." The man... And finally they drew that... They couldn't figure it out, because you cannot figure out God. God is to be received by faith, not by knowledge. You might read the Word through, and know every Word of it, and still be lost. You cannot figure it out. It's by faith are you saved and that through grace, not of works lest any man should boast. But quickly as soon as he seen the phenomena, he said, "Thou art the Son of God (The believer did.) the King of Israel." He said, "Because I told you that, you believe?" Said, "Yes." Said, "Then you'll see greater than this." 'Cause he's a believer.

L-36 Now, let's look at Him again. That was the faith that Jesus was introducing to the world. Now, He did not at one time, did I ever read, say to the people, "Bring Me this one here, and I'll show you I can heal." He never claimed to be a Healer. You can't make the Word of God contradict Itself. Jesus said, "It's not Me that doeth the works; It's My father that dwelleth in Me. He doeth the works." One day He had to go up to Samaria, or to--down to Jericho. Instead of going right straight down to Jericho, He had need of going by the way of Samaria. And when He got up there, He sent the disciples away, being about eleven o'clock, into the city to get some vittles. And while they was gone, a woman (as we call over here "ill famed,") came up to the place to get a jug of water. You'd almost have to go in the orients once to find out what those things really are.

L-37 So He... She come up to get the water at about eleven o'clock in the day. Jesus was setting over against the wall, probably setting there looking down, waiting for her to come. So when the woman come, that was perhaps fulfilled what the Father told Him to go by. So He looked over at the woman. He said, "Bring Me a drink." And they had a segregation in that day, a ritual, about like we have today. And said... She said, "Well, it's not customary for Jews to ask Samaritans such." He said, "But if you knew Who you were talking to, you'd ask Me for a drink. And I'd give you water that you don't come here to draw." Why, what if the woman wouldn't have believed Him then? But the conversation went on. To my honest opinion, Jesus was trying to contact the woman's spirit.

L-38 Now, the Scriptures plainly said that He perceived their thoughts. Is that right? Not like a psychic reader. That's the devil. And everything the devil's got, he patterned off of God. 'Cause God is the Creator and the only Creator. Dancing you have, that first started with God. The devil took it. All things you want to see that the devil's got, he counterfeited it off of God. But Jesus speaking to the woman, till He found exactly where her trouble was, then He went right straight to the cause, 55-0220E, Contend For The Faith, Shriner Temple, Phoenix, AZ, 107 min and said, "Go, get your husband." She said, "I don't have any." Said, "That's right. You got five." Now, listen at the woman's reply like Nicodemus. Jesus now, the Introducer of the faith of the Christian, said, "You had five, and the one you have now is not your husband." Supernatural... And she said, "Sir, I perceive that You're a prophet. Now, I know Messiah when He comes, He will do these things." The very sign of the Messiah, what you call "the devil" today. Said, "I know that when Messiah cometh, He will do these things, tell us all things. But Who are You?" He said, "I'm He that speaks to you."

L-39 The very sign of the Messiah. This Samaritan woman knew that. Said, "I know when the Messiah cometh, that'll be the Messiahic sign, that He will do these things." Well, friend, if Jesus being the Messiah... You believe that? And if He raised from the dead, is He the same yesterday, today, and forever? Then won't He do the same thing? See? Said, "When the Messiah cometh, He will do these things." He said, "I'm He that speaks with you." And she ran into the city, said, "Come, see a Man Who told me everything I ever done. Isn't this the very Messiah?" He never told her all things. He just told her that. But if God could show Him that, He could show Him all things. That was the Messiah.

L-40 The little woman that touched the hem of His garment and run out into the audience. Her faith pulled that gift of God. For He was God, through His lips. That's the reason... See? When the Father showed Him a vision, it didn't make Him weak. But when the people's faith poured it through Him, that's what made Him weak. He said, "I perceive that I've gotten weak." And He looked around, seen her, let her know that her blood issue had stopped, that she was healed. Said, "Thy faith has healed thee." If that was Jesus then, and that's the faith that He taught, that should the same Jesus tonight, if He's raised from the dead, 'cause He's the same yesterday, today, and forever.

L-41 Now, a blind man one time, at the walls of Jericho, name of Bartimaeus. He was setting there crying, begging. He cried out to Jesus. Perhaps thousands of people following Him, how could He hear? Some of them hollered, "Away with you, you fortuneteller. Away with Him. He's Beelzebub." The priests reviling Him. And Jesus with the--with the sins of the world laying upon His shoulders and His face set to Calvary, knowing He was going straight to Jerusalem to die for the sins of the world... Pushing through that crowd. Some of them hollered, "Hail, hosanna to the King of Jerusalem. Hosanna! Hosanna!" screaming on every side. The priests say, "You are crazy. That guy's a witch. He's Beelzebub, the devil. He's a fortuneteller. Keep away from such a man." All that had...?...

L-42 Old blind Bartimaeus said, "Who--who passes?" And he started crying, "Thou Son of David, have mercy." You think Jesus probably way out on the road there could've ever heard that man's cry? Not through all that howling mob. But what did it? His faith stopped Jesus dead still in His tracks. Jesus stopped with the same thing, to my opinion, that the woman did, and turned around, said, "Thy faith has saved thee." With all that burden and concern, and the destination of every soul that ever lived hung on His shoulders, and He knew it, and He was going to pay the supreme sacrifice; and yet with all that pressure upon Him, the faith of a poor, illiterate, blind, ragged beggar stopped Him dead still in His tracks and received what He asked for. Not a priest, they didn't believe it. But an illiterate, blind, ragged beggar, that's what did it. Oh, praise God in the highest for such a Saviour! God would humiliate Himself, and come down into a form of sinful flesh, and be concerned about the poor man that can live in the country. He was made poor, that through His poverty we may be rich. Oh, man and woman tonight, believe Him. Do you accept Him?

L-43 Now, one day He passed through the pool of Bethesda. Saint John 5. And the people said that... Or, the Scripture said, rather, that great multitudes... Listen close. Follow me now. Great multitudes of impotent folk laid there. Now, 55-0220E, Contend For The Faith, Shriner Temple, Phoenix, AZ, 107 min let's see what they looked like how this impotent folk... What--what's wrong with them? They were lame, blind, halt, and withered. What a mass of suffering humanity. Just a little while after the woman had touched His garment, full of virtue, and here comes the Son of God right through a mess of people like that, perhaps ten times what's setting in this building tonight, waiting for the moving of the water. A mother with a water head baby, a poor old blind daddy, one crippled up with arthritis setting, and of blind, lepers, and everything else, twisted, lame, halt, withered waiting for moving of the water...

L-44 And Jesus, God, Emmanuel, full of virtue, full of love, full of compassion moved right through that audience without touching a one. See, friends, you fail to understand between the spiritual and the natural. I've seen men who was theologians to the highest degree and knowed no more about the spiritual things, than a Hottentot would know about an Egyptian knight. See? They understand Scriptural things but not spiritual things. The Pharisees, very fundamental and orthodox, but failed to understand the spiritual things, so they said He was a spiritualist, or a devil; that is a spiritualist. See? 'Cause they'd seen the phenomenal, and they failed to recognize it; because they were just lettered altogether: fundamental in doctrine, but nothing in a vindication. Amen. I hope you see it.

L-45 Notice, now those people come by like people today with a love, they talk about love. There's two different kinds of love: Agapao love, Phileo love. Phileo love, Agapao love and Phileo love, one is Divine and the other one's earthly. Agapao love, it would make... If you seen a man going over putting his arms around your wife, now, Agapao love would make you shoot that man to the ground and kill him. 'Cause it's human love that you love your wife that way. But a Phileo love, the love of God, would make you put your arms around him and pray for his lost soul, if the law said it. Turns you altogether around.

L-46 And that's the way Jesus full of love and compassion, passed through these people, with love and compassion... But when we think, "This poor old man laying here. This poor little child that's a dying." This that. That is the Agapao love. That's a love. That's our compassion that we have. That's humanly speaking. But Phileo love is to do the will of Him that's send you, Divine love. He passed through that crowd of all them twisted, and lame, halt people, went right over there to a man laying on a little pallet. Now, watch; Jesus knew... I'm coming back to this one now. Jesus knew the man had been there. And He hunted around till He found that man. Wonder why? Looked all through that audience, till He found the man, like He did to the woman, looked through to find who it was touched His garment. When He found the--the man, he said, "Will thou be made whole?" He said, "Sir, I have no one to put me in the water. I can walk. I'm not crippled. I--I'm all right. But I--I've got a disease that's been retarded for thirty-eight years." The man never said that, but Jesus knew that. So he said, "I've had a disease..." It wasn't going to kill him. But said, "When I'm coming to the water, someone can outrun me, or just steps down before me." Jesus said, "Rise, take up your bed and go into the house." He picked up his bed and started off.

L-47 The Jews found him. They begin to question him. Then they brought Jesus in and questioned Him. And when they questioned Jesus... Listen. What would say tonight in a Divine healing service if the mayor of the city was deformed and laying here to be healed, and here stood the--the president of the United States, the governor, congressman, and all them, maybe, with cancer, or tuberculosis laying twisted and bound, laying on a cot, and God would come around and heal some poor illiterate colored woman or--or boy? See? That's the way God does it. You get what I mean? Go up here on the Apache reservation and heal him. He don't even know his A, B's from C's. God doesn't look at human prestige. He looks at the simplicity of faith. It was there.

L-48 Jesus said to them... No doubt they said to him, "Let me see you go down and heal this one. I'll believe you." They said that to Him. "Come down off the cross, and we'll believe you." Put a rag around His face and said, "Now, you--you perceive thoughts. You tell people what's wrong with them and so forth." Put a rag around His head, and hit Him on the head, and said, "Now, tell us who hit you. We'll believe that you're a prophet." He never opened His mouth. God don't clown for people. No. It isn't a--a stage show. It's the Church of the living God in operation.

L-49 Then notice, Jesus said as soon as the this was done. He said to them... Listen at His words, Saint John 5:19. 55-0220E, Contend For The Faith, Shriner Temple, Phoenix, AZ, 107 min "Verily, verily I say unto you, the Son can do nothing in Himself, but what He sees the Father doing. Whatever the Father doeth, He showeth the Son." Is that right? Read it when you go home, the 5th chapter of Saint John. Jesus said, "I can't do nothing in Myself." Did He tell the truth? He had to tell the truth. In order to be God, He had to tell the truth. His words were infallible. He said, "I can do nothing in Myself." Therefore He didn't heal one person in Himself. He said, "I... The Father shows Me first by a vision what to do, then I go do it. Verily verily I say unto you (John 5:19), the Son can do nothing in Himself; but what He sees the Father doing; that doeth the Son likewise. The Father worketh, and I worketh hitherto."

L-50 Now, when Lazarus died, when he was sick Jesus left the place. He went another day's journey. And they sent for him. He went another day's journey. He just kept going. Very strange wasn't it? But then He turned when He seen the time that the Father had told Him all about the vision and what was going to happen, He turned around and said, "Our friend Lazarus is dead. And for your sake, I'm glad I wasn't there. But I go wake him." And when He come to the grave, look, showing that the Father had showed Him, said, "Father, I thank Thee Thou hast already... But for these, I say this, because of these that's standing by." Then He said, "Lazarus, come forth." And a man that been dead four days stood upon his feet and walked again and lived. Because the Father had showed Him what to do.

L-51 Now, to save time, that was the faith that was delivered to the saints. Now, we see if the saints kept it. Now, did they deliver it?...?... saying... You said, "Brother Branham, you just talked about Jesus." All right. Jesus said, "A little while and the world will see Me no more." The word there is "Kosmos," meaning the "world order." "The world will see Me no more, no more. Yet ye shall see Me." Now, he said, "Sure, that was the disciples." See what He said. "Ye shall see Me for I (personal pronoun), for I will be with you, even in you to the end of the world." Is that right? Who's... Now, there's got to be some world's today that won't see it. And there's got to be some "ye's" that will see it. The Bible said in Hebrews 13:8, "Jesus Christ is the same..." Same in principle, same in power, same in love, same in compassion, "The same yesterday, today, and forever..." Is that right? Jesus died and rose again and we believe that He rose from the dead. He isn't dead now. He's a living. We try to make Him dead. But He's alive anyhow. He's alive

L-52 Now, notice quickly as we're drawing to a close. Jesus said, "The things that I do (the very same things that I do) shall you, even more than this shall you do, for I go to My Father." And you say the works is greater. Look at--look at it and see what it is. It's more. How could you do greater? It's more of it, because He could be all, in every church everywhere. "More than this shall you do for I go to My Father." Is that right? He was to ascend up to God, before He descended again in the form of the Holy Ghost. He was going to make the atonement, then return in the form of the Holy Spirit. And He said, "In a little while the world won't see Me no more, yet you will see Me; for I'll be with you, even in you to the end of the world: Jesus Christ the same yesterday, today, and forever."

L-53 He gave that commission to His church. Now, let's see what the church did about it. Peter one of the key men, when he was in prison one time, all hopes was gone, bound in shackles, a Pillar of Fire, an Angel of Light came in the building and loosed the shackles off of Peter's feet and hands, opened up the door before him, and delivered him from the prison. See? Peter was on the housetop, and a Jew not wanting to mix with the Gentiles, and God showed him a vision about noontime one day, and told him how to go up to Cornelius, because he was praying and waiting for him. Is that the same thing that Jesus did?

L-54 Paul on his road down to Damascus was stricken and was blinded in his eyes. And down in Damascus, the Gospel had been preached down there. And there was a man by the name of Ananias, who had received the Holy Ghost, some little Full Gospel pastor down there by the name of Ananias. And he'd received the Holy Ghost. And he was in his room one day praying, knowing nothing about anything else. And he was a prophet. And the Lord spoke to him and 55-0220E, Contend For The Faith, Shriner Temple, Phoenix, AZ, 107 min said, "Ananias." He said, "Here I am Lord." He said, "Go up to the street called Straight. Give him a vision, and said, "Go, lay your hands upon Saul, that he might receive his sight and be filled with the Holy Ghost." He said, "Lord, I've heard great things about him. That he--that he threatens the church, and arrest them, and so forth." And he said, "Behold, he prayeth." That changed it.

L-55 Here went out Ananias, up through the streets of maybe some other avenues, till he gets a street called Straight. Come down along the city fountain looking around saying, "Now, let's see. According to the vision it was a such and such a house. I'll have to look at it. There it is right there." Walked right in. There laid a man rolling in there, blind from being stricken down from the Pillar of Fire that hung before him, Shining like the sun in its brightness. And he said, "Brother Saul (Amen.), the Lord Jesus appeared to you in the road...?... say that Saul, or the one had a vision... The Lord came, told on me." There you are. "Said for me come, lay hands upon you, that you might receive your sight."

L-56 Now, what if his priest said, "Say, I got and old fellow across the street here for you to lay his hands on him and give him sight." He couldn't do it. He only could do what God showed him to do. Amen. Said, "Lay your hands upon you that you might receive your sight and be filled with the Holy Spirit." Hallelujah. He laid his hands upon him in obedience to the commission, what God bid him to do, the power of Jesus Christ in the resurrection. And everything God told him happened on the minute. That the way God does it yet. That's the faith that was once delivered to the saints.

L-57 Paul later on, how many we could call of the character and such things happening with the saints. Paul was out on a little old ship. He told them not to loose from Crete. But they went out there. And fourteen days and nights, every hope that they'd ever be saved was gone. The ship was water-logged. And there it was bouncing through the waters, the people screaming. They wouldn't eat. Knowing that they'd never see their wives and families again. Paul, just as scared as the rest of them, walking about with chains on him. Any minute the old ship would capsize and go over. That'd be the end of it. No moon and stars, fourteen days and nights, her pitching back and forth in the storm, no way to hold it nor nothing... Little old Paul thought perhaps he'd pray through, for he... All hopes was gone. He was a man. No matter how much he was acquainted with God, all hopes is gone.

L-58 Paul went down in the bulkhead somewhere to pray and stayed all night. The next morning, this little Jew run out and said, "Be of a good cheer." What's happened? "For there stood by me this night, the Angel of God, Whose servant I am, saying unto me, 'Don't fear, Paul, you've got to be brought before Caesar; and lo, God has give all these that sail with you.' How by... it must... This little old ship I saw in the vision last night, that it must be broke up on a certain shore. Wherefore, brethren," He said, "be of a good courage, for I believe God. It'll be done just as He told me it was." That's the faith that was once delivered to the saints. Paul...?... preaching, looked upon a man and perceived his faith and said, "Stand up. The Lord Jesus makes you whole." Do you got that faith in your church? If that what's operating, then contend for it, earnestly contend for it, for the faith that was once delivered to the saints.

L-59 I believe that Jesus is raised from the dead, church. I believe He's alive among us tonight. Do you believe it? And He's here just now. And I believe that He will. I can't say He will. My faith lets me believe that He will, and somehow do tonight the same things He did when He walked the shores of Galilee. That's the faith as far as I know it in the Bible. Jesus promised it. Jesus introduced it. Jesus lived it. God produced it through Him, out of Him, nothing but what the Father showed. The apostles did the same thing. They come against obstacles and could not do it. But when God showed them something, they went and done it. That's right. And that is the faith that was once delivered unto the saints.

L-60 Now, I want to ask you something now, as I close. If our precious beloved Lord Jesus, the Son of God, in His resurrection power, will come into this audience tonight as a living Being in a form of--as the Holy Spirit, and will do 55-0220E, Contend For The Faith, Shriner Temple, Phoenix, AZ, 107 min again through you and I the things that He did here on earth, will you accept Him as your personal Saviour, and have no more doubt in your mind? If you will raise your hands and say, by raising your hands...? You mean to tell me only one third of you will believe? What's left for you to do, but to be condemned then? You mean if the Lord Jesus Himself... How could you ever be forgiven? Let me say one word. What is the unpardonable sin? To reject truth when it's presented to you. Is that right? Hebrews 10 said, "If we disbelieve (or sin, same thing, sin is unbelief: 'He that believeth not is condemned already.')--if we disbelieve willfully, after we have received the knowledge of the truth, there remaineth no more sacrifice for sin, but a fearful looking for the judgments and fiery indignations; which shall devour the adversaries." Is that right?

L-61 Where was it first told to Jesus? When He was doing the very same thing that I promised that He--by God's help that He will do sometime while here in Phoenix. Maybe tonight, maybe tomorrow, I don't know, but asking you if He will... And the people come up and misjudged Him, and said, "He does this by Beelzebub." He said, "Now, whosoever speaks against the Son of man, that'll be forgiven you. But when I'm dead and raised again and you speak that, and reject that same truth through Holy Ghost, you'll never be forgiven in this world or the world to come." Is that the Gospel? That's it. That's what was presented to the saints. Never forgiven for unbelief when the truth is presented. Shall we pray?

L-62 Our heavenly Father, upon the basis of the shed Blood of Thy beloved Child, the Lord Jesus, upon the witness of the resurrection of His being here, I now come to Thee to ask for pardon and mercy, for myself and this audience, that through Thy Divine grace, that You will overlook all our sins and un--and misbelievings. Father, knowing that sin is unbelief... And I pray God that You'll wipe all unbelief out of our heart. For we realize that we're mortal beings. We're now bowing our face to the dust where we was taken from and shall return. And maybe before the sun rises in the morning, that we will have to stand in Your Presence to give an account for every idle word and everything that we've done on this earth. Knowing that in a short time... Yea, even science now it's sight, that the end shall come. And one day through Phoenix before long, and through this earth, there won't be one stone left on another. She'll be blowed into pieces by the atomic bomb, to fulfill the Word of God that says, "The whole heavens and earth will be on fire in that day." The atoms of the earth blowing and exploding, screaming and people reaching for the--for God. He said, "I'll only mock and laugh at you in your calamity." What a time. Father God, I pray in Jesus' Name that You'll save sinners tonight.

L-63 And while we have our heads bowed, I wonder if there has someone in here who's not a Christian, just raise your hand, say, "I raise my hand to God and say, 'Now I accept.'" God bless you, sir. Someone else say, "I now accept Jesus as my Saviour." Would you raise your hand, anywhere on the bottom floor? God bless you, sir. God bless you, lady. God bless you, little girl, see your hand. God bless you, the little colored lady back there. I see you also. Someone else say, "I now raise my hand, say, 'Lord I now believe.'" God bless you, young lady, back there with your hand up then. Someone... God bless you, over here, lady. I see you. God bless you, down here. I see you. "I now believe." God bless you, sonny boy. Someone else on the bottom floor say... God bless you, sir. God bless you, sir. The Holy Spirit's looking on now.

L-64 See, the truth shall make you free. Jesus said, "He that heareth My Word and believeth on Him that sent Me has Everlasting Life, and shall not come into condemnation, but's pass from death to Life." Because he's believed on the Son of God. Someone else raise your... Now, you may have intellectual faith. You may believe it from the standpoint of the Word. But in your heart, in your soul, has the Holy Spirit ever called you to there? No matter what your mind says, something in your soul believes. If not, then you're outside of God, outside of Christ, dead, alienated from God, dead trespasses and sin, a sinner bound towards hell.

L-65 Would you raise your hand and say, "I now am raising my hand, God, want to accept Jesus Christ as my personal Saviour. In my heart something tells me that right now I should." Would you raise your hand? Someone else on the bottom floor? May God bless you, little lady, I see you. 55-0220E, Contend For The Faith, Shriner Temple, Phoenix, AZ, 107 min Just one more on the bottom floor? Just make your decision just now. Now, over to my left in the balcony, would somebody up there raise your hand to God, not to me, just to God; say, "Lord, by raising my hand, I now accept my pardoning by the merits of the Lord Jesus Thy Son. I now accept it for my salvation." Would you raise your hand, to the left in the balcony? God bless you, sir. I see your hand. The peace of God rest upon you my Spanish brother. [Blank.spot.on.tape--Ed.]

L-66 Jesus said, "Except a man be born again, he cannot see the Kingdom." You can't understand it. It's a mystic, mythical thing until you're born again. There the very Life of God comes in you. Everlasting, Eternal Life, Zoe, God's own Life comes in you, and then you're a part of God. You're a Son of God or a daughter of God. And then you see as God sees. You believe as God believes. Then you'll be a new creature in Christ Jesus. The Lord bless you now. I believe now we'll pray for the sick. I want to ask you something, friends. God could do more in one minute to convince people, than I could all night preaching. I'm going to ask you if you will... Now, parents get your children near you, and please don't no one walk around during this part of the service. Now, if you're an unbeliever, don't stay. Now, if you are a believer... And now remember, for spirits of unbelief I am not responsible, so you'll know. Now, everyone get you a place, and be seated, and then just pray, and ask God to help you, and God will bless you, I'm sure. Don't move around. I'll explain it later; I haven't time tonight. This is just one night. We can't get everything in in one night. So I'll just ask you now to be reverent and just be--and be seated if you will. Do this for the Kingdom of God's sake.

L-67 Now, how many in the building has prayer cards? Raise up your hands. The boy give out prayer cards today. All right. Here, they're sitting right in here. Is this reserved for the (All right.)--the sick in here. All right...?... 1 to a 100? All right. He gave out a prayer card. Now, on the front of it will be my picture and a place for your name and address, so the ministers can have it if they want to look you up. And in the back here will be a letter A and a number, and it'll begin from 1 to 100. Then let's line some of the people up here to pray for them. Now, remember as I say... I am not telling any one that I can heal the people. Only your faith in Jesus Christ will heal you. Now, I want...

L-68 Who has the prayer card number 1? Let's see... Is there a number 1 prayer card there? 1, 1... Let's see, take the first five: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5. Would you all come back here? See if you can get up there. If you can't, well, somebody can help you. As they... Somebody's deaf? Well, look at somebody... All five doesn't raise up; there's three of them. Where's 4 and 5 at? There's the other two; would you come over here, lady? Right over here to my right, if you will. All right, fine. 1, 2, 3, 4, 5. Who has prayer card number 6? Raise up your hand. 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, let's see them raise up. That'll be five more. 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, would you raise up right away, those now, so that we can see where they're at. Stand up so we can see where you are. 6, 7, 8, where's the other two? 9 and 10? What? Oh, sorry, you know... Excuse me, lady. I thought maybe they was all setting here. All right. Come on 9 and 10. All right. Would you come over here?

L-69 1, 2, 3, 4. There's one more missing. Anyone with prayer card of 6 to 10. Would you stand up? Look at somebody. Maybe he's deaf and can't hear the number called. Maybe somebody--somebody... Would some of them workers or something check these...?... the chairs setting here. Maybe the people can't get up. Oh...?... sir. You have it? Okay. That's fine. All right. All right. 6, 7, 8, 9, and 10. All right. Now, who has prayer card 11, would you raise up? 11? 12, who has 12? 13, 14, prayer card 14. 15? All right. Let's see how that is now. Let's wait just a minute and start with these; then start praying for these first. Won't have to stand as long then. All right. Did you have a prayer called, sir? Come right on out then if you will.

L-70 Now, will you all be real reverent? And trust that the Lord Jesus Christ, in His infinite mercy, will show mercy to we that unworthy. 55-0220E, Contend For The Faith, Shriner Temple, Phoenix, AZ, 107 min Now, how many in the building? Now, be real reverent; listen close. How many in the building that does not have a prayer card, and yet, you want God to heal you? Raise your hand. Just raise up your hand. Anybody in the building? Got prayer cards... Well, it's just solid, all over, and up in the balcony.

L-71 Now, look, to you without prayer cards... When It... If the Holy Spirit comes and starts His work of the Lord Jesus here in our midst, I ask you... Now, these people here, that doesn't mean you're going to be healed, if they're going to come in the prayer line. That doesn't mean it. You have just the same chance, plumb back in the back up here, anywhere He wants to, if you'll just absolutely believe the plain Gospel till you get God, through that birth that's been accepted. Now, if you'll do that and believe with all your heart anywhere through here, that--that you'll believe with all your heart that the Lord Jesus will grant that to you... Up in the balcony, where ever you are, see if the Lord Jesus doesn't turn around and vindicate the same thing to you.

L-72 Now, if He will do that, will you believe? God bless you. Now, let us sing quietly, if you will. Now, that's good, just be real reverent and be real quiet. Now, my son and my manager here, Mr. Moore, the other assistant here, Mr. Brown, and them that's on the platform, they watch. It becomes a subconscious. I do not know what's going on. I can tell; it goes into another dimension. We'll explain it after some nights now, what happens to the best we can. We can't explain it. But what happens? You go into another world. And then we want to see you tomorrow night. Everybody be reverent. They watch, and when they think I've got enough, then they take me from the platform.

L-73 Now, the only thing these are lined up for, is just to get the anointing of the Holy Spirit started. Then your faith... See, it comes down here, and your faith operates it. I don't. I have... Now, these people in the line, there's not a person there that I know. Frankly, I don't see a person in here that I recognize outside of... I've seen a minister here I thought awhile ago that I knew, I believe setting right here. If I'm not sure, this is the brother that has the tabernacle. Little fellow, right here, Brother Fuller, is that right? Brother Fuller... Now, there may be others that I know, and I can't recognize them at this time. And I... That's the only persons in here that I really recognize at the time. Right now.

L-74 Now, their--their all strangers to me. Now, if Jesus was standing here with this suit on, that He give me, standing here in person, and if you people are sick, could He heal you? No, sir. How can He do what He's already done? Could He save you? No, He'd tell you, "I already did that." The works that...?... saying is finished is finished. Is that right? The work, the complete plan of redemption was finished at Calvary. Oh. And you cannot in no means deal with sin without dealing with sickness, 'cause sickness is an attribute of sin. So if the work was finished...

L-75 Now, the only thing He can do is send some good inspired preacher to preach the Word. If you won't believe that, He might have somebody with a gift of speaking with tongues that He could speak and tell a person, "If you'll go, take this thing back, or do something, or...?..." like that through interpretation. That's the same as prophecy. Or He has a prophetic gift, that He puts in the church that magnifies, and lifts Him up, and shows to the people. Then you are right where you're setting, then you accept that. Then you're healed. See what I mean? Or then you're saved. Amen. The Lord bless you now. As we sing low, if you will just once. And everybody be reverent now. Only believe, only believe. All things are possible, only believe. Only believe, only believe, All things are possible, only believe.

L-76 As I know that His anointing is coming near. I can see someone--hear someone down way off like in another land, saying, "Why is he singing?" See? Here it is. You remember when they played the music when Elijah... and the Spirit of God come up on him. He was a man until then; then he was God's servant after that. He saw a vision. Certainly. You have to get God in the midst of it. See? That's right. 55-0220E, Contend For The Faith, Shriner Temple, Phoenix, AZ, 107 min The prophet was all discouraged. He'd been rebuking the false people who were standing by him. He said, "Bring a minstrel." And they'd begin to play, the minstrel, the music started; then Elijah got into the Spirit and begin to see a vision. See? It's the same God today. If He loved music then, He loves music now. Same Lord Jesus... The Lord bless you now.

L-77 For the glory of God, for the upbuilding of the Kingdom of God, I take every Spirit into my control, for the glory of the Lord Jesus Christ. In anything, may you set reverent, and quiet and listen to the Spirit of the Lord. Now, if the operator, the engineer of these microphones, if you'll step them up just a little bit, for sometimes after it gets started, I have no idea of how loud I'm speaking or how low. Be just real reverent.

L-78 Now, this woman being coming up here just now, I suppose that we are strangers to each other, are we lady? You and I are strangers to each other. I've never seen you in my life. And I don't know you. So if--if anything could be done for you, and I could do it, I'd be a brute not to. But the Lord Jesus knows you. He knows me. And you being a woman and me a man, if--if God can come on you and use you for a faith and can put His Spirit on here, on me, to use me to speak to you about it, then we praise God for it. Isn't that right? It--it can. Of course, if He--if He can anoint me so that He can show me something to help you, so then, it's my fault, or something. But He doesn't desire to do it. And if He can't anoint you, that your faith would cause that (See?), then it's then to... It'd be your fault. But if it's... See, I don't know what you're here for. You know that. But God knows what you're here for. So now, just like the woman at the well, our Lord Jesus talked to her awhile. I think with all my heart He was catching her spirit. See, 'cause if you are a human being the same as I am...

L-79 And if you're, if it's, whatever it is. If you're burdened, or if you're sinned, or if there's something wrong in your life, or if you're sick, or whatever it is, the Lord Jesus could let me know that. Won't that be the same Lord Jesus that raised up from the dead, the one that was here on the earth? Does the audience believe that, the same Lord Jesus? You're from here in Phoenix? You... You're here. Well, there's people here that know you. See? I don't know you. But the Lord Jesus knows. Now, us being totally strangers to each other, and then may the Lord help me. Now, if He will go right into the spot and tell me what you're standing there for, then you will accept Him as your as--to give you whatever you want, that you're here for. Is that right? Will the rest of the audience... If God will do that as you see the woman and my hand... I never seen the woman before in my life, no nothing of her... Now, will you accept Him as your Healer and Saviour...?... if He will do it? Thank you. Now, just talking to you, so that your spirit and mind... Now, your--your spirit with your faith, and my spirit was the anointing of the Holy--Holy Spirit (See?) to know what is wrong. Now, to the woman, if the audience can still hear me, the woman's very conscious that something's going on. For she knows she's standing in the Presence of something. Between her and I stands a Light, real bright, emerald looking Light, which is the Angel of the Lord. And the woman is conscious that something's going on. And she's here for me to pray for her. And her trouble is a depressed, mental condition that's a bothering her. She's mentally upset. And she is also been real sick with the case of... It was in her lungs. It was pneumonia. She's had pneumonia and has been very sick, and it's... Those things were true wasn't it, lady? If that's true, raise your hand?

L-80 Do you now believe? That voice that's speaking then was not my voice. It was my voice, but I wasn't operating it. I do not know what's wrong with the woman. Whatever He said is on the tape down here. And you can read it tomorrow. Whatever He said is true. That's the truth. Now, the woman knows. She knows whether it was the truth or not. She's a witness of that what was in her life, what's wrong. Was it the truth, lady? Every word of it was said was the truth? And while I was talking, or whatever that went on there something struck you wasn't it? Because it's light around you. You're healed...?... Be real reverent and believe with all your heart.

L-81 Now... Are you believing, sir with all your heart? You're--you're--you're the patient I'm talking to. Are we strangers to each other? Are we, sir? We do not know one another. Come here just a little closer if you will. You've never saw me before? Best of your knowledge you've never saw me. Yes, yes, sir. 55-0220E, Contend For The Faith, Shriner Temple, Phoenix, AZ, 107 min The people can hear his voice coming in. Spirits call for help one to another. You've been very nervous recently. You got a sinus trouble bothers you. You have a sinus trouble. Setting right there got sinus also. That's right. You're praying for get cured of sinus. Your faith does it, lady. Them spirits called one to another. You got someone else you're interested in, haven't you? You believe that God can let me know who that is and what it is? He can. It's for a niece isn't it? Got kidney trouble hasn't she? Is that right? Something struck you then, wasn't it? That was witness of the Holy Spirit, go and find it just as you have believed.

L-82 Just have faith. Don't doubt. [Blank.spot.on.tape--Ed.] Don't doubt. Was that person was healed, did they get back in this audience here somewhere? Something else just... There's a woman that appear... Oh, here it is. It's a--it's hanging over this lady right here. It's a throat trouble. The lady has a throat trouble. You believe that God will make you well? With all your heart? All right. Just raise up and accept it then, and be made well. Bless you. See? You don't need a prayer card; you just need faith. Have faith in God. Is this the patient?

L-83 Excuse me, lady. I'm not beside myself. It's such such an impression it takes on me. We're strangers to each other, I suppose, are we, sister? Now, this is our first meeting time as far as I know. Oh, I have prayed for you. When I was here the last time, I prayed for you. Oh, when you was healed with cancer, that's when I was here. Well, I'm so happy to hear that. Now, it was probably told that that later on that whatever it was. Of that I couldn't say. I--I just--I have no way of saying. He just... 'Course you just coming through a prayer line... Tomorrow I would never remember you. The only thing it is, is just picked up on the tape here. And I find it that way. But was you in one of these kind of prayer lines? Just like this? And just exactly what It told you, was it the truth? And what It told you would come to pass, did it happen just the way It told you, That you would be healed, and the Lord...? Oh, It called out of the audience in a chair. Oh, in a chair, setting in the chair... We're thankful for that, sister.

L-84 Now, you're here again. I'm a stranger to you. I do not know you. I've never seen you in my life, outside of that time, but not being to know you. Now, if the audience will... The lady's here at Phoenix. Do you know her? You hear our voices here, each of us? This microphone picking it up? If the Lord Jesus... Now, she told me was been healed of... What was it, sister? Cancer. At another meeting, while she was setting in the chair, perhaps, like them ladies, or peoples, or whoever it is that's been healed out in there. Now, here she is as a living witness. Now, if the Holy Spirit will reveal to that woman, what she here for. It may be a financial. It may be a domestic trouble. I could not tell you. Only God knows. I don't. The lady knows that. I have no way of knowing what--what you're here for now. Isn't that right, lady? No way at all of knowing what she's here for... But someone here does know.

L-85 And the faith that was once delivered to the saints is the faith the Lord Jesus Christ in His resurrection. He can tell me what's wrong with her. Now, if He does, I'll be thankful. If He doesn't, I'll still be thankful, for I know He's here. And if He does, will one hundred percent of you, everyone, believe with all your heart? Now, just a little closer, sister. See, spirits coming from everywhere now. And it's... You know what I mean? When visions starts, I have no way of knowing where it's coming from. I just have to contact the spirits of a person involved. Now, I'll just would speak to you just for a moment. And oh, you don't have to look to me. Just look any way you want to. Just so I can catch your spirit. That's what I mean. You believing? All right. God be with you. Your faith healed you. You've been... Something wrong with the inside down here in the intestinal's. It's a--a... You've had a... I see you going to some kind of a place, that's a--with something white over you. It's a hospital. You've been into a hospital. Now, they are. It's an operation, and they take something from the inside, pulling it out. It's the--it's the intestinal colon. They take out and cut. And then I see they're putting something back in its place. It's a--a plastic surgery that they're performing in the colon. And now, I see it again. It's twisted around like this. And that's what you're here for. THUS SAITH THE LORD.

L-86 Those things whatever He said, is that the truth, lady? If it is would you raise up your hand, if it's the truth? You believe you're in His Presence? You know your brother has no way of knowing that...?... God alone, is that right. Come 55-0220E, Contend For The Faith, Shriner Temple, Phoenix, AZ, 107 min here just a moment. Kind heavenly Father, while the Holy Spirit is among these here, I--I follow instructions of my Lord, which says, "These signs shall follow the believer: If they'll lay hands on the sick, they shall recover." This I do in the Name of Jesus Christ. Amen. God bless you, lady. May you... May God grant unto you your desire.

L-87 You believe Him with all your heart? Be real reverent; don't move. You see, you're every one, every spirit's moving in here. See? And when you change, that just throws me off. So be real reverent now. See? He keeps moving through the audience You see? If you turn, facing the audience, you just feel it like... Oh, I can't explain it. But I just have to follow what He says do. How do you do, lady? We are strangers to each other, I suppose, mother, aren't we? We're strangers. All right. I just want to talk to you a minute. You are aware right now that you're in the Presence of something besides a man. That's right. You're--you're aware, 'cause you're a believer, and you're know that something besides this poor man standing here.

L-88 You're suffering with a--with a sinus condition. And you got a burden way down deep in your heart. See, your conditions is minor, but there's something appeared before me. Yes, I see it coming back again. Oh, my. You are a mother. You have a daughter. And the daughter is doing evil. And you're--you're wanting prayer for her. She's an alcoholic. You--you want prayer for your daughter. Those things was said are true, aren't they? Come here just a minute. O merciful Father, as Thy servant, give mercy and peace to this tired mother before me. And may the deep desire of her heart, whatever it may be, be granted. This I ask in Jesus' Name. Amen. God bless you. Just believe; have faith. Don't doubt. Believe, and you will receive. Please don't move around. Someday, glorious day when it's all over, you'll realize...

L-89 How do you do, lady? Are we strangers to each other? We've never met each other, never in life. Well, but Jesus knowed you since you was born. He knowed me since I was born. And perhaps back yonder before either was born, he'd knowed we was going to meet here tonight. He is an infinite God. He knows all things. Predestinated certain things to take place. But even before the world was ever formed, He foreknew all things. If God will help me to know what your trouble is, will you be willing to accept what He tells you to do? You will? Now, us being strangers, never knew--knew one another... They give you a prayer card, and your number was called up. That's all there is to it. And then... But God knows all about it. Now, just believe that you're--you're... Believe on the Lord Jesus Christ, and believe me to be His servant. I have nothing I can do to help you. If... I can't do nothing. There'll be what I told you about the Lord, that He loves you and wants to do for you. Now, the only thing He can do, is do something that would lift your faith up to a place to get what you come for. Isn't that right?

L-90 There's really not much wrong with you. You're nervous, all upset. Now, I see it turning dark, just a moment. It's a... I see a--a desert...?... and a hill running back to this side of it. And it's concerning a loved one. It's a daughter. And she--if I'm not mistaken, the hill that I'm looking in front of me, it's at Tucson, Arizona. And that daughter is very unhappy. And she's suffering with a mental condition. She thinks she's going mad, going wild. She has walked the floor a lot--whole lot. She does lot of things. Keeps looking out a window, constantly faces that way, around that way. Those things are true. Now, give me the handkerchief you have in your hand. Our heavenly Father, Creator of heavens and earth, the Author of Everlasting Life, Giver of every good gift, send Thy blessings to this one, Lord, And I pray that when this is performed that Your great Spirit will honor faith. For I ask in Jesus' Name. Amen. God bless you. The Lord grant it to you, sister, the very deep desire of your heart, that Jesus Christ, God's Son...

L-91 You believe in Him, man? You're trying to reach me aren't you? Your faith... Just a little disappointed, because you wasn't called a few moments ago. You don't have to do that. You're trying to get rid of something, aren't you? Not exactly a disease; it's temper...?... real quick, get angry. Will you accept my words as being coming from the Lord Jesus? Will you believe me as His servant? Stand up on your feet. Put hand over your heart. Raise your other hand to God. 55-0220E, Contend For The Faith, Shriner Temple, Phoenix, AZ, 107 min Our heavenly Father in the Name of Jesus Christ, the Son of God, this boy's faith has touched You. I rebuke the trouble that's wrong with him, and may he never be bothered again. In Jesus Christ's Name. Amen. God bless you.

L-92 How do you do, lady? Look this way just a moment. You believe? It's not you; it's for the baby. If God of heaven will reveal that little baby's conditions to me, and let me tell you what it is, will you believe that Jesus died to do for it, whatever it is? I see certain sickness. Now, that baby is suffering with something wrong with its, it's in the lungs. And that baby has three ribs missing and part of its lungs. Father God, in the Name of the Lord Jesus Christ, bless this one who I bless in Your Name, Lord, in Jesus Name. It's all through now...?...

L-93 Believe Him? Look this way just a moment. Heart trouble's nothing for God to do. You believe He will make you well? Accept your healing now of that heart disease and believe that God will make you well? Father, in the Name of Lord Jesus, bless this new soul for God's glory. Amen. God bless you. Go, believing Him with all your heart. You believe? Something strange when that lady was coughing. Made you feel real strange, didn't it? Cause you do a lot of it at nighttime. It's a asthmatic condition that's causing it. That's right. You believe the truth? Can you accept Him now as your Healer. Then in the Name of Jesus Christ, the Son of God, may you go free, sister...?... The Lord bless you. Just have faith. Something wrong with your side, isn't it? You've got side trouble, two of you there in the line. And the lady just in front of you too. All right. Jesus Christ makes you whole now. Be well. God bless you.

L-94 Lady, setting back in here, the lady with your hand up to your mouth, you want to get over that arthritis? You believe that Jesus Christ will make you whole? You believe it with all your heart? If you do, you can have your desire. Just say, "Praise the Lord." And accept your healing and God will grant it to you. Sister, do you believe God? You know, that I have no way of knowing what's wrong with you. God alone knows it, doesn't He? If God will let me know what's your trouble, will you obey me as His servant and believe God? Then go eat your supper. The ulcer that was in your stomach, and your stomach trouble has left you. You can go eat your supper. God bless you. I'm a stranger to you I suppose, sir. But around you is a real dark shadow moving, it's a coming to your spirit. You're dying. It's cancer. That's true. But you can live through Jesus Christ. Do you believe Him? Do you accept it? Come here. Almighty God, in the Name of Your Son the Lord Jesus, heal the man before...?... God bless you. Go, and believe with all your heart.

L-95 Look this way, lady. Now, I don't mean to be looking at me. 'Cause Peter and John said, "Look on us." In other words catch the attention. You want to get over that diabetes and be made well? Let God make you well? You'll believe He has done it and accept now with all your heart? All right. Go on your road rejoicing. In the Name of the Lord. God bless you, honey. Pray for your grandmother? And you yourself want to be prayed for? You believe Jesus can give you new blood, and take that anemic condition away from you, and make you well? God bless you. Father God, for this child who doesn't fully developed yet this little girl. I pray for the child here in my arms in the Name of Jesus Christ for a blood transfusion and may it come. Amen. Bless you sweetheart. Find your grandmother to be healed.

L-96 You believing, with all your heart? You believe, sir? That's your son right there, father and son. If God will tell me what's wrong with your son, even if he's setting on the other side of you, then tell me what's wrong with you, will you be willing to accept the Lord Jesus for healing? You've got heart trouble haven't you? Your son's more...?... child, but not now. Now, go on your road rejoicing. You believe? I feel Him patting me on the shoulder which means going take me from the line. How many wants to love the Lord and serve the Lord? You believe He's the Son of God. Every one of you that has been a unbeliever and now you believe, would you stand up on your feet just a moment. Every unbeliever that now is a believer, accepted Jesus, would you stand upon your feet? Just remain standing just a 55-0220E, Contend For The Faith, Shriner Temple, Phoenix, AZ, 107 min moment.

Everyone now who wants to receive the baptism of the Holy Spirit and wants to be born again, would you stand to your feet just a moment? You'll see the glory of God. Stand up just a moment.

L-97 Where's the minister? Ask him where a prayer room is. Now, I'm going to ask God. I want you to find your way to the prayer room, so we can meet you there. Heavenly Father, in the Name of Your Son, the Lord Jesus. Grant the forgiveness of sin. Jesus, You've raised from the dead, dear Lord. You're here now, beyond a shadow of a doubt. You're moving now on the people for the last time. Have mercy upon them each tonight. Grant the healing of their bodies, for every sick person in here. May every person here in Divine Presence be totally and wholly delivered of every disease that they have in their life. As your servant, I condemn every sick person's disease in here, and proclaim them as diseases that have been removed at Calvary, every curse of the devil. And for these who are standing to accept salvation and the baptism of the Holy Ghost, Almighty God, if I have found favor in Your sight, I pray that You'll grant these hungry hearted people every desire of their heart, through Jesus' Name. I ask the people who are standing in here, please to come to the prayer room right away if you will...?... Courtesy of Living Word Broadcast P. O.
