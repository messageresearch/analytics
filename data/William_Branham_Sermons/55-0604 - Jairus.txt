--- TRANSCRIPT ---

L-1 Friends, I'm sorry to be late, but I was blocked out, and I couldn't get in. This is one time I couldn't get to service. Oh, someone just pulled in and blocked the gate, and we couldn't get out till they--someone to move it. We're thankful to be here tonight to be in the service of the Lord, to see all you fine people out here and trust that this will be a great night for His Kingdom's sake, that many of His sick children may be healed tonight, many unbelievers will become believers, accepting the Lord Jesus Christ in the pardoning of their sins. Now, before we go farther, shall we bow our heads just a moment in a word of prayer as we speak to the King. Our heavenly Father, we're grateful to be tonight for this privilege that we have of gathering together another day this side of the coming of the Lord, realizing that we don't know just when He will appear in glory, but knowing this that after this mortal life has ceased, we have the blessed promise that beyond this veil there awaits for us a tabernacle not made with hands. God has provided for us a better tabernacle, wherein there will never be a prayer for the sick. There'll never be a prayer for the sinner. All these mortal things and earthly things is passed away then. In our being now we groan in the Spirit for deliverance while we're here, Father, as pilgrims and strangers, professing that we're not of this world, that Christ has called us out, called us to--chosen, elected for His sake; and we're thankful for the opportunity to bear His message. Come to us tonight, Lord Jesus, quickly. Take the service into Thy own beloved hands and minister to each one of us as we have needs. For we ask it in Jesus' Name. Amen.

L-2 Now this--this evening as we speak about the Lord Jesus... Last evening we had a most marvelous time. Seldom you find great faith like that at the beginning of the service, but it seemingly that this was just a little different. We had a great beginning, and we're happy for it. Such faith would continue it's just hard to tell what out Lord would do in the coming days. I think tomorrow afternoon they're to have the services in an auditorium here in the city. Perhaps it's already been announced by the brethren who know where it is, and bring out the unsaved tomorrow. Now, every church that the time when we--don't have it on the Sunday night or on Sunday morning, because it would interfere with other services of the city; and we do not want to interfere with any religious service. Anyone that's serving God, we believe that on Sunday mornings and Sunday nights, their post of duty's at their own church. To you visitors that are here, visit some of these churches tomorrow yourself. Make yourself known to the people. Get acquainted with the saints of God around this community and come to the service tomorrow afternoon. And then tomorrow night back to your regular post of duty. Now, tonight for time the first few nights when we have a long service like this of the ten nights... Seldom our services run over three nights: three to five nights is just about the limit. But in this case we had the state arena here, and we realize the metropolitan center of the city here isn't too great. It's about (I guess) seventy-five thousand, I think someone told me. So we have plenty of room.

L-3 I always keep my meetings rather small, because that I don't have to--to beg for offerings to pay off the expenses. If one thing that I think that I glory in the Lord Jesus for helping me in that manner. I don't have nothing that I have to support like a radio program, or television program, or anything. I just come and visit you and little expenses that we have we take it up right away, and I never will permit people to--to beg for money regardless of how far we go in debt, they can't do it. The manager's ever found begging that's the last time he's a manager, 'cause we are not to take people's money. We're here to help you, to bring something to you, and you're a blessing to us. And we do not come for your money, and we try to keep that clean and clear worldwide. Now, we close the service, the Lord willing, Sunday a week and then Thursday I go to Switzerland, and then from Switzerland perhaps to Frankfurt, Germany, and then up into Sweden, if the Lord willing and back to the States again to continue the services up through Canada. 55-0604, Jairus, A Secret Believer, Porter Stadium, Macon, GA, 89 min

L-4 Now, we appreciate your prayer. Prayer changes things. There's only one thing that can change the mind of God and that's prayer, but God can say anything, and prayer can--can change it. That's a pretty good bite, wasn't it? But it's the truth. It was in the Scripture that He did. Could you imagine the prophet Isaiah, going up and told Hezekiah, "THUS SAITH THE LORD" (a real prophet) said, "Go up and tell Hezekiah he's not come off that bed; he's going to die right there." So Hezekiah... Went up and said, "THUS SAITH THE LORD that you're going to die right there where you are. You're not coming off the bed." And when the prophet left, I can imagine going out through the celebrities standing outside the gate saying, they say, "Oh prophet of God, what about our beloved king?" "THUS SAITH THE LORD he's not coming off of the bed." Goes on out to the soldiers in the outer courts. "Oh prophet of God, what about our king?" "THUS SAITH THE LORD he's not coming off of the bed." To the poor people outside the gates, "Oh prophet of God, we believe that you come from God. What about our king? What--what's going to be the end of him?" "THUS SAITH THE LORD he's not coming off of the bed. He's going to die right on his bed. THUS SAITH THE LORD."

L-5 Got on out to his little hut, old Hezekiah turned over, began to talk to the Lord and said, "Lord, I beseech Thee to consider me. For I've walked before You with a perfect heart." That's a great big word, isn't it? Testimony like that. "I have walked with a perfect heart," and he needed fifteen years more. Now, the king was the highest figure, earthly speaking or politically speaking, in the whole nation of Israel; and the greatest man, politically speaking, was talking to the King of kings. Now, it looks like if the King of kings were to have anything to say back to the king, He would spoke to him, but it sure proves that He was talking to him. But God has ways and means of doing things His own way, and if through that it goes back out to the prophet. And He says to the prophet, "Now, you go tell him that I heard his prayer, and I'm going to send him fifteen years."

L-6 Could you imagine the position that put Isaiah in? Here he comes right back through the gate again, "THUS SAITH THE LORD he is going to live." Right up to the soldiers, "THUS SAITH THE LORD he is going to live." Right into the celebrities, "THUS SAITH THE LORD he is going to live." Well, I'd imagine you'd say what kind of a prophet is that? What was the big difference? Prayer changing from death to life. It'll do it for every sinner here tonight from death to life. It'll do it for every sick person tonight from sickness to health. Prayer changes things. So always bear that in mind. Pray without ceasing. If you want to be an indebtiment to the meeting, just don't pray. If you want to be the greatest help this meeting can have, it's not financially; here's the greatest help you can be to this meeting: set aside an hour or two every day that you pray for the meeting. Go out and visit someone if the Lord puts on your heart and bring them into the meeting. Then pray that God will save them when they're in there if they're not saved, heal them if they're not, if they're sick and in need of healing. That's the greatest contribution that you can give to any meeting is to pray and seek God to help in this time of trouble.

L-7 Now, just turning into His Word, my word's very feeble as we know being a man's word, but His Word being God's eternal Word then He cannot fail. My words are just--just apt to fail as... I'm just a man like your word, but God's Words will not fail. It is written in the Book. Now, in the Book of Saint Mark and the 5th chapter and beginning with the 35th verse we shall read a portion of Scripture just before we speak a little bit on the Word for "faith cometh by hearing, hearing the Word of God." And then we will read His Word. Where if my words does fail, the meeting will not be a failure, because it'll fall back to His Word; and His Word will bring forth the what it was purposed for--intended. Jesus speaking now. 55-0604, Jairus, A Secret Believer, Porter Stadium, Macon, GA, 89 min While he yet spake, there came from the ruler of the synagogue's house certain which said, Thy daughter is dead: why troublest thou the Master any further? As soon as Jesus heard the word that was spoken, he said unto the ruler of the synagogue, Be not afraid, only believe. Now, may the Lord add His blessings to the reading of His Word.

L-8 Being that this is more or less a faith message, a faith message of Divine healing, secondarily. Our first motive of these meetings is to save lost souls. A body no matter how bad they're bedridden, how sick they are, someday they've got to die if they're made perfectly whole tonight. But that soul which is immortal when it's healed will live forever. Divine healing is many times it's been said that healing services are just all the stress put on physical healing. If you'll notice about eighty percent of Jesus' ministry was Divine healing, but Divine healing is like the bait that's on the hook. You don't show the fish the hook. You show him the bait, so he gets the bait and the hook too. So that's what we think about Divine healing. God sets in the Church great signs and wonders to get sinners conscious of His Presence. Like the gift of speaking in tongues, it's not for him that believeth, but him that believeth not. See? It's signs to the unbeliever, and today we have plenty unbelievers.

L-9 I've taught much to heathens in Africa, India, many different parts of the world, but the worst unbelievers you deal with is not that man who has never heard. It's the man who's self centered in his own way and won't heed to God. That's the worst kind to deal with, for they seem to be just so centered that--that nothing can move them, say, "Don't talk to me. I don't believe it." Recently a man said to me, said, "Brother Branham, I do not believe in Divine healing." I said, "Well, it wasn't for you. It was for believers. 'Him that believeth' that's who it's for. It wasn't for unbelievers in the beginning." I said, "So you'll never draw any dividends off of it. Let's don't worry about that." He said, "I believe that sickness is a glory to God." I said, "Well, it's strange you had your wife operated on for appendicitis: must've cut the glory out." So people that talk like that, there's something wrong. God don't get glory out of people being sick. He wants you to be well. Our Blessed Bible said, "Above all things, I would that you'd prosper in health." That's the Scripture. So we can't deny that.

L-10 Now, in order to have faith, faith has to have a basis. You just can't let faith be loose and wild. Faith has to rest itself, not upon the shifting sands of man's reasoning. Faith is based on the solid Rock of God's Word. Faith rests right on God's Word. If the Lord has said so, then that settles it. It doesn't shift about. Men how sometimes they can explain anything so real and paint the picture so real, but yet faith will never look at that if God's Word is contrary to it. It'll track straight to God's Word. And when He said, "I'm the Lord that healeth thee," you believe that for God said so. And we believe it because God said so.

L-11 Now, in the days of Moses, when God sent Moses down to deliver the children of Israel, before He could deliver the children of Israel... First Pharaoh, there arose up a pharaoh who did not know Joseph, and he was a smart pharaoh, perhaps trained in all the theology of Egypt--smart, shrewd--but he didn't have... He had a good reasoning, but he didn't have the Word of God. Now, he reasoned out scientifically and said, "Looky here. They're all multiplying. They're more of a thrifty people than we are; they can live on a smaller income, and they're--they're generating and multiplying. So the thing we must do is stop this right away, kill all the infant babies, males, so that there'll be no more... They won't grow so fast. If Pharaoh... They said they might come a war and if a war would fall out, he said, "Then they might join themselves with our enemies and fight against us. They'd be greater than we are and powerfuler than we are."

L-12 Now, his reasonings was correct, scientifically correct, but where Pharaoh made his mistake was not looking into the Word of God that knowed that great promise that God was going to bless them and bring them out anyhow. No matter what science says, what reasoning says, if it's not based on the Word of God, I'm sure sorry for the person 55-0604, Jairus, A Secret Believer, Porter Stadium, Macon, GA, 89 min that listens to it. So therefore, faith can't rest on reasoning. It rests on God's Word, what the Lord has said.

L-13 Now, when in... Moses went forth to deliver the children of Israel... Moses was a different person from Pharaoh. Pharaoh looked at it scientifically, which is all right, but if scientific is all right, then if it's contrary to God's Word, don't believe it. If it's with God's Word, thank God for it. Just like, for instance, doctors, hospitals. Some people says we shouldn't have doctors. We shouldn't have hospitals and perform operations. I--I disagree with that. I'm very thankful for hospitals and doctors and operations. I'm thankful for these electric lights tonight. I've thankful for the automobile that brought me up here; but if any time they work contrary to God, I don't--I won't fool with it. That's all. But when it's working with God they are natural blessings that God has given us. The clothing that we wear, that's better shoes than sandals were, and it's better than going barefooted. The hats that we wear and so forth. It's--it's better than what we did have before the tree of knowledge produced this; and we're thankful for it. And every discovery along medical science and so forth that can help anybody, we are thankful for it.

L-14 Because remember this, my dear friend, there's no medicine, or no doctor, or no hospital that ever has or ever will heal anybody. There's no drug in the world that can heal you. Ask a doctor. They don't claim to be. I've been interviewed by Mayo Brothers twice. They say, "We do not claim to be healers. We only claim to assist nature. There's one Healer; that's God." Look how simple it is. If I cut my hand tonight, here on the platform, they haven't got a medicine in the world can heal that knife cut. We haven't got a medicine in the world that they can guarantee to heal a bad cold. Thousands die every year, doctors and all, with bad colds. See? Penicillin and sulfa drugs isn't healers. It just assists nature while God heals. Say for instance a knife cut my hand, what if I would cut my hand with a knife tonight, and all the--all the doctors in the world could do nothing for it as--to healing it. Now, they can keep it clean with Tincture Merthiolate, and give me penicillin, and so forth, but they can't heal it because there's no medicine that will build tissue. God is the only Creator there is.

L-15 Now, if they had--if they had a medicine that would heal a knife cut in my hand, it would heal a knife cut in my coat. It'd heal a knife cut on this desk here. If it'd heal a knife cut, it would heal a knife cut, regardless of where it was, if a medicine healed a knife cut. Now, you say, "Brother Branham, you're getting off of the beaten path." All right. You say, "Medicine is made to heal human bodies not your coat and the desk." All right. Then I cut my hand with a knife, and I fall dead here on the platform. You might take me down to the morgue and embalm my body with a fluid that would make me look natural fifty years from now, and let the best doctors there is in the world come and sew that place up, give me a penicillin shot five times a day, put all the Tincture Merthiolate salve and cures there is on that. In fifty years from the day that cut will be just exactly the way it was when it was cut.

L-16 Then if medicine heals the human body, why don't it heal it? See it wasn't... Now, here's what it is. You say, "Oh, why, Brother Branham, the life is gone out. That's why." Well, that's different. You tell me what life is; I will tell you Who God is. That's right. So it isn't medicine that heals, it's life that heals. Medicine doesn't build tissue. God builds tissue. God made your first cell. God made every cell that you've got. And now, in the--in the afternoon instruction services you'll hear later on (if the manager doesn't come well, some of us will get it), where you'll find out how healing takes place, what a cancer is, where it come from. It's a different order. It's a different life. It's a different; it's a growth inside of you. Don't belong there. The devil put it there. It's a devil. It's exactly what it is.

L-17 Here's a natural body that looks just as natural. It's been that way for years. After while they maybe a cancer on there. It's a body. It's a multiplication of tissues, cells. How did it come there. A few years ago every one of you was just one little germ in the--the father. Through the holy wedlock and pollen that little germ into the mother... The little egg and the little germ went together, the blood cell is from the male sex. The blood has--mother has nothing to do with the blood of the child. It comes from the father. 55-0604, Jairus, A Secret Believer, Porter Stadium, Macon, GA, 89 min How God foresaw that many years ago, how that the... You people here, many of you are farmers perhaps. You can take a hen and let her lay ever so many eggs. If she hasn't been with the male bird, they'll never hatch. They're not fertile. The blood comes from the male.

L-18 Take an old female bird. She can lay a nest full of eggs. Get up on it and hover those eggs, and set on that nest so loyal and faithful, until she will get so poor she can't fly off the nest; and unless she's been with the male bird, they'll lay right in that nest and rot. They will not hatch. It just reminds me of some old, cold, formal churches. Just... You can hover them, and beat them around, and call them this, and baby them around and give them Ph.D.'s, and you ain't got nothing but a nest-full of rotten eggs anyhow. You might as well dump the thing out and get with Christ Jesus. Get some faith in the Church where it's right. Get with Christ, the Mate. You say, "I don't believe in Divine healing. I don't believe in the Holy Spirit." Because you've never come in contact with It. That's it. You get right with God one time, and you'll believe every bit of the Word of God. Every bit of It will be real to you.

L-19 That germ comes from the male, and God performs that. He did it years ago. That one little germ begins to grow. It develops into a human body. Now, it grows up to where it is now. Perhaps a cancer comes in there. That's another multiplication of cells. Where did it come from? The first thing it usually... A cancer, being that we're talking on that, is one of the great killers. It can be with any disease, any affliction. It comes from a bruise, usually on the woman's breast. It caused the row of cancer, and it's just like pancakes and there's so forth piled up on one another and it can be successfully operated if caught in time. There's a red cancer which is like streaks that goes through and different kinds: sarcomas cancer, and other different types of cancer. Being that we're talking of cancer, well then, you can see what I mean. If the doctor can find it in time and cut it out, it's a success. If he cannot, it gets a hold, the patient dies. It just keeps growing, just sucking the blood. It's a demon. What happens--a cell.

L-20 Everything that Satan's got, everything that Satan ever did, he made it off of something God created. Satan's not a creator, but he perverted what God made. That's how he perverted good into wrong. That's how he perverted that cell. In other words, the cell backslides. That's a big word for a Baptist to say, isn't it? But it... Anyhow, it--it--the cell backslid and that's what causes the trouble. And then it begins to develop cell on top of cell. A demon power comes into that cell. You know where you come from. You come from God, but where did this thing come from called cancer? It come from the devil. There's only two resources that life can come from, either from God or from the devil. And that just keeps growing a great growth. Now, that's what we deal with here on the platform, not the growth itself but the life in the growth. That's what we're dealing with--the life in it. If you was a cancer on earth, the way to get rid of you in the way of Divine healing is call your life out of you. You'd fall down on the ground. You're still here on earth, but then for a few days you'll--you'll perhaps shrink.

L-21 When a human body dies... An undertaker here would know that. Well then, a hunter knows. You shoot a deer tonight and wait. Throw it on the scales and tell the boys how much it weigh. In the morning throw it back on the scales, and see how much it went off through the night. Let it lay there a few days, and then throw it on the scale, and look how much more it weighed than it did in the first place. That's how I tell the patients: watch about seventy-two hours; corruption sets in. And that body begins to swell like a little dog laying on the street. He begins to swell after he lays there so long. The patient then, that the evil has gone out of the patient, the cancer is dead. For a few days they feel fine. Like the cataract, tumor, or whatever it may be, they feel fine for a few days, and then the first thing you know it begins to swell, swell. And then if the patient isn't truly instructed in the Word of God, they'll lose their healing as sure as anything, because they get sick and get twice as bad as they ever was. And that's the best sign you ever had that you're healed, certainly, is swelling. It's gone away. 55-0604, Jairus, A Secret Believer, Porter Stadium, Macon, GA, 89 min

L-22 Then if you really... If your faith has been built upon somebody, some Divine healer, or--or somebody professing that's got something when they haven't, then you're gone. But if your faith is built on the Word of God, all devils out of hell wouldn't ever make you deny it, for it's settled down in here. It's not up here in mental theology. It's down here in your heart. It isn't a intellectual faith. It's a faith that's sunk in your heart by Almighty God. No matter how dark the road looks, you still shout the praises of God, 'cause you know God's revealed it to you and that settles it. That's why people sometimes needs to have the instructions. Have knowing where your faith lays, not upon man, not upon somebody's ritual, or some curious feelings or something other like that. Your faith is built on the Word of God. There's where faith takes its resting place.

L-23 Moses no matter how great the army was, how Pharaoh's army looked. Didn't mean nothing to Moses. When he met God up there, he knowed God's Word. He was instructed in the Word of God and when he... God met him with that Angel up there in the burning bush. Could you imagine an old man out there on the side of a hillside with--on a burning bush, burning, and he stepped aside to see it... What if he--what if he'd went over, and just for curiosity, like some people comes to meetings, just for curiosity. Say, "I'm going to pull some of the leaves off and take it down to the laboratory to have it tested, and see why these leaves don't burn. The fires all over them and when the fire goes off, I will see what chemical was in them." You'll never get anything... They's only one way you'll ever know anything about God. That's by faith you receive it. You believe it because God said so. And when I was... explain makes nothing about it. You believe it.

L-24 And Moses, after seeing that Angel seeing God's glory... Did you notice Moses wanted to see God's glory before he went? And God showed him His glory. What was it? Divine healing: put his hand in his bosom turned to leprosy and taken it out, put his hand back and healed it again. So Divine healing is God's glory. So Moses when he seen that and knowed the Angel, the Pillar of Fire was with him, I tell you; he went home and got Zipporah, his wife, and set his two children and her on a mule, and here he went to Egypt.

L-25 Now, you talk about a ridiculous sight. Look at this some of you Georgia people. There was Pharaoh's army to... The opposition of Russia today would be nothing to compare with the world power it had then: Pharaoh's army, the mechanized units, the thousands of chariots, the spearmen, the horsemen. They had all the world beat to defeat. And here goes an old man, eighty years old, whiskers hanging down to his waistline with a crooked stick in his hand (it dry as a bone), with his wife setting straddle of a mule, with a child on each hip, glorifying God. Some of them say, "Moses, where you going?" "Going down to Egypt to take over." Could you imagine that? Look what science would say about that, but the good part about it: he did it (Amen.), because God had promised it. And God's Word will never fail. He went down and took over. Opposition means nothing when God has spoken. No matter how bad you're sick, how--how bad you're crippled, opposition is nothing to when God speaks. His Word's eternal and forever true. He did it. It was a ridiculous looking sight, but he went down and done it, because he had faith. God had promised it, and he knowed it laid in the realms of God, and he went and done it because God was with him. Certainly.

L-26 Now, in the same time when the sons of men had got back in trouble again, God sent His promise again: His Son, the Lord Jesus. When He came, misunderstood... All the teachers of that day had it all just so fixed out, that they knowed what the Messiah was going to be. When He come they had it just fixed the way it had to be, and you know what? When Jesus was born in Bethlehem of Judaea, the priests was in arguing what kind of buttons they ought to wear on their clothes. That's right, and He was borned out there on the hillside, and He never visit one of them. The Angels of God came and sang to shepherds. That's right. It's the Magis, stargazers over in the east, come following a mysterious star or a light that led them to the Christ.

L-27 When He was here on earth, the devils knowed more about Him than the preachers. That's right. The devils... The preachers said, "This man's Beelzebub. He reads minds. He's--He's the wickedest of all the fortunetellers. He's a smart fellow. I tell you. He's a mind reader. He's Beelzebub, the chief of all the fortunetellers." That spirit never did die. 55-0604, Jairus, A Secret Believer, Porter Stadium, Macon, GA, 89 min Notice. But the devil said, "I know Who You are. You're the Son of God, the holy One of God." The devil was right.

L-28 Paul and Silas was up there having a great revival, and the preachers said, "These guys..." The teachers of that day, not all of them, but the teachers of that day and the great high churches said, "These men turned the world upside down. They're impostors." A little, old fortuneteller set down on the street, said, "These men are servants of God that tell us the way of life." You know, you can get so ritualistic till even demon-possessed people who have the conception of spirit know more about things than people that's so ritualistic and formal. That's a great big word. It cuts, but it'll do you good. Amen.

L-29 Sometimes we have to get real sick, you know, before we need medicine. Mama used to tell us when we'd take castor oil, and raised a little old country on pone corn bread and black-eyed peas... And every Saturday night we'd all take a bath in an old cedar tub, pour the water in out of a big old teakettle, and all take a bath, the little old boys, and ten of us. And I remember every one had to take dose of castor oil. I can't stand the stuff yet today. When I'd start say... Mama would tell me... I'd hold my nose; I'd say, "Mama, it makes me so sick. I can't even look at it." She said, "If it don't make you right good and sick, it don't do you no good." So that's the way the Gospel is sometimes. It don't get you right good and sick, it don't do you much good.

L-30 So Jesus poured the Gospel out from His heart, for He was God's chosen Vessel of the hour. Though the people wanted to say Caiaphas was, though they wanted to say that their church had all the light, no need of anybody else saying anything... But Jesus come strictly... Now listen: Christ came on the Word. But it was just a little different than what they was used to hearing. Because that it didn't dovetail in with their mental conception of the Word, then they refused to hear Him. But God was with Him. God performed miracles and worked wonders. He said, "If you can't believe Me, believe the works that I do; for they testify the Father has sent Me." The sons of men, way on off, no faith, built upon their churches and things, and no faith left in the Word, only the way they believed it.

L-31 So we find Christ going about healing the sick, speaking to the people, tell them their different ailments, or whatever was wrong, and they said "That's Beelzebub. You see, He's a fortuneteller. We know He comes from the devil," and so forth. But it didn't hinder Christ a bit. He knew He was sent for a Divine purpose, and He was determined to fulfill it, for He knew what the Lord had said. He went about at the task. Every true servant of God will do the same. If it's no more than a little dishwasher in the kitchen by a housewife (Amen.), she will stand true when she really sees the revelation of the Lord Jesus Christ. No matter what the neighbors say about her 'cause she lets her hair grow out and wears her clothes decent... The neighbors will say she's gone old fashion. And I'd rather be silly to the world, than be the devil's fool any time. I sure had. I--I think that what... If a person ever has a revelation of God move into their heart, it changes the whole motives, their life, their appetite, from everything they once was has been changed.

L-32 Jesus in during a time of His ministry, many of those Pharisees and Sadducees, they believed on Him, but they couldn't openly confess it, because if they did, the alliance told them if they was going to put them out of the synagogues. They was going to be excommunicated if they went down to His meetings. So He... That didn't bother Him. He just went ahead preaching anyhow. Now, our story comes tonight for the next few minutes upon one of those type of fellows by the name of Jairus, who was a ruler of the synagogue. I've always thought that Jairus was a secret believer. He believed in his heart, kind of a borderline believer. He believed in his heart that that truly was a Man of God. He believed that that was God's eternal Son, His Prophet, Priest and King, but he was afraid to make mention of it, because he would be throwed out of the synagogue. And that still exists. So then, we find out, if a man's really sincere in his heart, God will wo--work something around so that he will have to make his colors shine. God usually does that at times.

L-33 So we see Jesus about His tasks, going about. One night He'd crossed the ocean. Storms come up, and He'd went 55-0604, Jairus, A Secret Believer, Porter Stadium, Macon, GA, 89 min all the way from one country over to another to Gadara, and there He found a maniac. The maniac run out. Of course, the reason He went over there, the Father as we took last night... Jesus said, "I do nothing except the Father shows Me first. First I see a vision on what to do, then I go do it." Saint John 5:19. Verily, verily, I say unto you, The Son can nothing in Himself, but what He sees the Father doing, that doeth the Son likewise.

L-34 Then He went to Gadara, and there a maniac met Him and called for mercy. Jesus spoke to the evil spirits, called them out and they were all... Evil spirit when it's not inhabited in a human body is powerless, seemingly. So it goes over and gets into the hogs, and then they come out and told Him they didn't want Him over there, to leave the country. It would cost them too much to have a revival. But we find out that this maniac went back and testified and gave glory to God. When I get over into glory land, I want to meet this maniac that was a maniac, and find out how much pressure his testimony had against hog raising in Gadara after his healing. He really must've stirred the country, but they didn't want the lovely Jesus. They were better satisfied with the hogs and devils than they was with Jesus. That same thing exists today. That's right. All right if you don't want Him, He will never push Himself on you. You have to want Him. You have to have a need.

L-35 One night the disciples was waiting on Him down by the seashore, and they took off ahead. They thought, "Oh well, we can make it anyhow. We will go on out into the sea." And so they rowed on out, went off without Jesus. That's what's the matter with a lot of families around here and everywhere else. You think you can row across the sea of life without Jesus, but you'll find out there'll be trouble in the little bark before you get too far. You can't stem the tides of life without Christ. There they was out, but I love this. Oh, my, when I think of it. Now, He knew they went off without Him, but you notice He climbed upon the hill, and He watched them out in the sea. And He seen the devil catch them out there in that little whirlwind and begin to dash the boat up and down, but His eye was on them. He was watching for them.

L-36 Maybe the devil has caught you out somewhere, and give you a disease or some sickness, or you're backslid, or something like that, but remember He climbed the ramparts of glory and setting on high. His eye is on the sparrow, and I know He watches me. He is from everlasting to everlasting God; He steps up and He watches you. He sees where you're at. He knows we're having this meeting tonight. He knows how concerned each one of us are about it. He knows your interest in Him. He knows your interest in the Kingdom. He knows where your heart is. So He watches over His Word. And then, we notice when the little ship was just about ready to sink as she rode up and down in those tides. The mast pole had dropped; the sails were gone; the oars were broken. And there they was, the little ship water-logged and floating around out there in the sea. The devil said, "I will have them pretty soon." But all of a sudden they looked, and here He come walking on the waters. Just in the darkest of time, then Jesus comes along.

L-37 This may be your darkest hour setting here tonight. The doctor might've give you up with cancer, tuberculosis, heart trouble, but it's right at that darkest of hour when Jesus comes walking by, sometimes unrecognized. They seen Him and noticed the disaster of it all. When they looked and seen Him, they was afraid of Him, because they thought He was a Spirit. Many people tonight who are afraid to attend the meeting, for they said, "I believe this or that, or they're spiritualist or they're fortunetellers, or they're demon-possessed or something." And notice in that case there the only Thing that could help them, they were afraid of It. And many people tonight are on hospital beds and afflictions, and the only thing that can help them is the lovely Lord Jesus; and they're afraid to give Him a test, to try Him. Amen. That's right.

L-38 And as the waters pushed on, after while Jesus spoke and said, "Be not afraid. It's I." Peter said, "If It's You, Lord, give me just a little test." And ask and you shall receive. So He gave him the test, and when he tried to do it in himself, he failed, and every other 55-0604, Jairus, A Secret Believer, Porter Stadium, Macon, GA, 89 min man will fail. He got his eyes off of Jesus and begin to look how big the waves was. When he seen the waves were contrary, be begin to sink. And every man that will look at his affliction after being prayed for is sure to sink. You don't look at your affliction. You keep your eyes on the promise Giver, the Lord Jesus Christ. Keep your eyes on His Word. He's the One Who promised. He watches over It to perform it. He keeps it in the hollow of His hand, and in the depths of His heart it's bedded. His Words has to be True. Get your mind off of your sickness, off of your troubles. Keep your eyes on Jesus.

L-39 Then notice over on the other side of the shore as soon as they'd got over there, a little woman was upon the hill up there. Perhaps had spent all of her money on doctors, and none of them could do her any good. Perhaps mortgaged the farm, sold the teams, everything that they had. And none of them could do her any good, but she constantly grew worse and worse. What a time. The doctors probably with all the sincerity had tried to stop that blood issue, but they couldn't do it. But I can imagine her saying, "If I could only be over in the other land where that Prophet is, if I could only get close enough to touch His garments... I believe every Word He says comes from the Word of God. If I could only touch His garment, I'd be made whole. For I've heard many things of Him." And that night when Jesus toiling all night and the disciples across the storm-blowing sea, the devil trying to hinder the meeting just as hard as he could... He will do that to every God-sent meeting. You have it in your Methodist church, your Baptist church, your churches wherever they may be, the devil will work everything he can to keep it from coming. Go on anyhow. God said so. Stand toe to toe with Him and say it's THUS SAITH THE LORD. "Resist the devil and he will flee from you."

L-40 So they moved right on in. I can see that tired bunch of disciples, weary and worn from pulling through the night, Jesus nodding in the back of the ship. When the little, old boat pushed into the willows, I can hear the crowds begin to say, "Here comes that divine healer. Well, let's look and see what He has got to say. I'd like to hear Him speak a few words. Maybe He will perform a miracle or two that we can see. I know He says He don't do nothing but what the Father shows Him; but aw, we will just bring some people down and see what He can do." Jesus ignored them, walked right on. He wasn't fussing with them. He had the Father's will to do. That little woman, she pressed right on through every one of them unbelievers, probably crawling between the crowds and beneath the people, till she touched His garment, moved back out with a perfect satisfaction that her faith had made a contact--rested. And when she did that, Jesus turned and said, "Who touched Me?" Looked all around over the audience, and everybody denied it was them. Directly He looked down upon that little woman, said, "Thy faith has made thee whole, daughter."

L-41 All right. About that time there was a little man back over on the other side of the hill a few miles away. He belonged to the fine denomination of the Pharisees, wonderful church, had a lot of social prestige. Perhaps Jairus stood good in his city as a great teacher of theology. He may had his B.A. He may had his L.D., whatever it was. He was all dressed up as a professor. Down in beneath all those priestly robes, he truly believed that that was the Son of God. So God give him an opportunity to profess his faith and to put it to work.

L-42 All right. We find out when Jesus got onto the shore... The day before that the doctor probably come as a Christian usually does or believer or whatever it is... When someone gets sick, they do what they can for them. Jairus had one little girl about twelve years old. She took sick. God knew what He was going to do. That's the reason Jesus come over there. So Jairus' little girl took sick at about twelve years old. The doctor perhaps came, and checked her over, and said, "Well, we're give her a few of these remedies, these boiled leaves and barks and so forth. She will probably pull out of it. She's got a little fever or so forth." Days past, respiration begin to fall. All of these remedies--the poor man doing everything that he knew in that day to do. He done all he could, probably an immediate friend to the family. He used all of his drugs and everything he could, and the girl grew worse and worse. 55-0604, Jairus, A Secret Believer, Porter Stadium, Macon, GA, 89 min Finally he come in, and taken her pulse perhaps, and said, "Well, come out here, Jairus, you and your wife, I want to speak to you. I got something sad I have to say to you. I hate to do it, as your doctor, but in all my scientific knowledge that I have; your child's a dying. I'm watching her heartbeat. It's slowing up every minute. I've give her everything that I know how to give, and still she goes worse and worse. The respiration's about gone. Your child can't live but a little while longer, so you get ready for the shock."

L-43 Little Jairus, and the doctor doing everything that he could do, I imagine he paid the doctor, thanked him for all of his service, and went away. Poor little fellow, Mrs. Jairus, she was crying, probably Jairus, himself. Then way back down in the gable end of his soul, there was a little spark that he'd heard Jesus of Nazareth was the Son of God, and the promise that God would send Him in that day and would do these things, 'cause Isaiah said, "The lame shall leap like a hart," and so forth would take place. And if that Man was a fulfilling of that promise, then He had the glory of God with Him. So he said... I can see him go in and get his hat. And all the people, the members of the synagogue, around to watch the child die, and I can hear them say, "Jairus, where goest thou?" Well, Jairus said, "I'm going to take a little visit." Somebody must've told him that Jesus was a coming. That's a good message to preach even today. "Jesus is coming."

L-44 Well, they heard He was going to be down there, was down there, rather, at the willows, at the river-bank, and they heard that He was coming. So faith cometh by hearing, hearing of the Word of God. So Jairus gets his little hat on, his little priest hat, and here he goes. I can hear his church members say, "Jairus, where you going?" His wife said, "Honey, where you going?" "I'm making my way to see Jesus," he said. That's a good thing to do. In the hour of distress, make your way to Him, for He's the very present help in the time of trouble. I can hear his associates and all the deacon board say to him, "Boy, you'll be excommunicated. Remember that. Just wait till the next general meeting, and we will sure have you throwed out. You know what the high priest said, 'Anybody would fool around such a fellow as that, we don't have nothing to do with that.'"

L-45 But listen the time had come, the crucial moment, that he had a need. That's what we need today. When the time comes for a need, when death's knocking on your door, if you've never tasted of the baptism of the Holy Ghost and know the power of God to be borned again. You might laugh at it now, but when the need comes, you'll don't care who's standing around, whether you're excommunicated or not, you'll find your way to Christ, as certain as anything. Your church creeds won't have nothing to do at that day. No matter how loyal a member of the church you've been, Jesus said, "Except a man be borned again..." That little spark that makes you believe that, listen to it tonight, water it with faith. God will grow it into a tree of salvation to you.

L-46 Now, as we see this little fellow making his way down, and all the people criticizing him. But remember, he couldn't say now, "Oh, I will wait till a more convenient time." It was then. Action had to take place. He had to get to Jesus, or his child would die. And brethren tonight, if we don't get people to Christ, they'll die. The hour is here. People says, "I will believe in Divine healing in the millennium." Well, what you need with Divine healing when you're immortal. Today is the day, no more chance. This is the day of salvation. Let's get people to Christ.

L-47 Then I can see Jairus as he moves on. After while he comes in contact with this lovely little Fellow coming, weary-eyed, drooped-down, looked to be fifty when He was only thirty, probably graying a whole lot, the strain of the work. They told Him, He looked like He was fifty. Said, "You're not a Man yet no more than fifty, and You say you have seen Abraham." He said, "Well, before Abraham was, I AM." There He was, but He looked fifty when He was thirty, probably stooped over a little as He walking about. When Jairus seen Him, there stood all the priests around mocking Him, making fun of Him and everything. Some of them glorifying God for healing the woman... The priest said, "It's nothing but mental telepathy. There's nothing to it." "He didn't know that woman. How did He know it had--she had a blood issue." "I don't believe that. That's of the devil. He is Beelzebub." Making fun of Him and everything. But some of them was hollering, "Hosanna to God in the highest." They were rejoicing. 55-0604, Jairus, A Secret Believer, Porter Stadium, Macon, GA, 89 min

L-48 Then I can see the priest say, "You see who's a doing that, the trash, the lowbrows." Oh, my, if it takes that to believe God, I'm a lowbrow then. That's right. The common people heard Him gladly. Then Jairus walked up and become one of those lowbrows, as the street expression is. He run up, and fell down at His feet, and said, "Lord, I've got a little girl laying over there, just at the point of death." I can imagine him saying this, "I heard of You. Always down in my heart, I believed that You was. I know I've been taught not to believe it and everything, but Lord, down in my heart You know my heart, if You knowed that woman's blood issue; and You knew all these other things that You know. And God has told You. No doubt but what You know my heart. So I come. Come, lay Your hands upon her, and she will live." There you are, just where your faith lies.

L-49 Now, to Jairus was, "Lay Your hands on her." That was the Jewish way. The Jews laid on hands. But the centurion, not so. He said, "I'm not even worthy for You to come under my roof. Just speak the word, and my servant will live." Look at that authority. He said, "I'm a man under authority. I say to this man, 'Go, do this.' and he doeth it. I say to this one, 'Come' and he cometh." For he knew that this was a centurion over a hundred men and them hundred men had to do just exactly what he commanded. And he knowed that Jesus Christ had all sickness and demons under His hand. "Just speak the word." Hallelujah! I know you're going to call me holy-roller, so you might as well get ready to start right now. That's right. It's enough to make one out of you. Oh, "Speak the word." That's all you need. "Just say the word, and my servant will live." Amen.

L-50 Jairus said, "I've been taught laying on of hands, so come lay Your hands on my girl." Jesus knew He was going anyhow. Said, "Now, here we go." And away they went, little Jairus kinda looking around the crowd, and my, he kinda felt better after he heard Jesus say, "I will go." You can get an audition with Jesus in a few minutes, all, everything clears up. You don't care what they say about you from then on, as long as you can just get Jesus to talk to you a little. Here he goes down the road. His little head throwed back, smiling, you know, looking around at everybody. He didn't care how much they laughed at him. He was walking with Jesus. Anybody ever walks with Him don't care what the critics says. You ever walk with Him... Here he is walking along the road. "This Guy is a Seer. This is the Fellow. This is--this is the Man. I know He done it in other places, and He has already give me the assurance. Here I go." Walking right along.

L-51 Watch the devil now. He said, "I will bring the props out from under him. I will fix him up." About time they got a few hours down the road, here come a man running, saying, "Don't trouble the Master any further. Your little girl is already dead. We done laid her out. She's dead. Don't trouble the Master any farther." When Jairus heard that, I can see his little heart skip a beat. He grabbed his heart. He looked over toward Jesus. Jesus with that clear cut... One... Oh, my, I can't even find a word to say. That "know so, never in trouble," no matter how troubled it was around Him, He was always at peace. I can see those sacred eyes move over to see the reaction of Jairus. Said, "Fear not. Only believe. You'll see the glory of God." He knowed where He was going. He knowed what would take place. He knowed what the vision had spoke. He knowed God was faithful to the Word.

L-52 When He gets up around the place there, all of them was screaming and crying. I can hear the Pharisees from Jairus' church, saying, "There you are. There you are. Fool around one of them Divine Healers. The doctor told you your child was going to die. So now you see you've brought disgrace. Now what are you going to do?" Little Jairus with his head up, walked right on in. The people out there going on and making a big to-do. Jesus said, "Give place." In other words, keep quiet. He said, "The girl's not dead. She's asleep." Now, and what do you think they said, those people who doesn't know God? They knowed Him by the way of the church, but I know the way of salvation. They said, "Now we know He is completely crazy. Saying, that, she's not dead, and we got her laying out in there. The doctor says she's dead; the undertaker probably says she's dead. There she is cold and laying out on the couch. Why, she's dead and here this fanatic says she's not dead; she's asleep. Away with such a fellow." 55-0604, Jairus, A Secret Believer, Porter Stadium, Macon, GA, 89 min

L-53 You know what Jesus did. They laughed at Him. You know what He did. He put them out. That's right. So don't laugh at Him; you might get put out. He put them out. Put all of them out, on the outside. How could He do anything around a bunch of unbelievers like that. What believers need to do is congregate themselves together and pray till Christ comes into their midst. Then signs and wonders will take place. There He was, and He put them all out. There He was all enclosed about with all this unbelief. He stood there with the father and the mother of the child. They believed. Peter, James, and John was the only one could go with Him: faith, hope and charity. Walked them into the room, closed the doors behind Him. On the outside there was a wall of unbelief, but Jesus was possessed with a power, that after earthly things had failed He could speak with another language. And He spoke out into a world yonder where the child's soul was, and a girl that was laying stiff and dead, rose again to her feet in a bloom of life. Called her to her life as He spoke out, "Tabitha," and He called her back, "Daughter, arise." And He picked her up by the hand and said, "Give her some food." They'd probably embalmed her, and the blood was gone. So they said, "Give her some food till she gets strengthened."

L-54 Oh, I'm so glad tonight to know that that Jesus Christ still lives and reigns and still is the same God tonight that He was in that day. He's forever alive. Have faith in God. I am so glad corruption knew its Master. The spirit knew its Creator, and nothing else could do; but it had to return as soon as that Son of God called her. I'm glad tonight that if He should call, our names are on His Book, aren't you? My sinner friend, I trust tonight by God's grace, that your name will be placed upon His Book also, that you may know Him in the pardoning of sin, that you may know Him as your Saviour, while we pray if you will. The pianist, or organist, rather, will come if she will and play softly "Abide With Me," if you will, sister. While the audience keeps their head bowed for a moment. Every one in prayer now, believing with all your heart. Jesus, the Son of God, knows all things, can do all things. He loves everyone.

L-55 Now, if you're not a Christian, if you're not a believer, I trust that just now God would speak to your heart and say, "This is the hour to believe." Our heavenly Father, as we're waiting now. "Faith cometh by hearing, hearing of the Word." I pray Thee, Father, to be merciful to us all. Pardon us all of our sins and trespasses. Forgive us, and it is written in Thy holy Word, "He that heareth My Words and believeth on Him that sent Me, hath Everlasting Life; and shall not come into judgment, but's passed from death to Life." Father, may many be brought to a believing and saving knowledge of Thee this night. For we ask it in Christ's Name and with our heads bowed, praying.

L-56 Is there anyone in Divine Presence anywhere would say by an uplifted hand, "Pray for me, Brother Branham. I am a sinner." God bless you, son. God bless you, sir. God bless you, and God bless you and you. All up in the balconies. Oh, my. As I go out this way to look again. You can just see them from everywhere. God be merciful. Oh, my. Way out here to my left as I go over here, take a look... Up in there, would you raise your hands?

L-57 [Blank.spot.on.tape--Ed.] Daniel saw one vision and was troubled at his head for for many days. Is that right? True. You say, "Well, Brother Branham, I don't know about that." Most all...?... prophets and so forth are considered neurotics. Look at William Cowper. He wrote "There Is A Fountain Filled With Blood Drawn From Emmanuel's Veins." After writing that song, tried to find a river to commit suicide. Look at Stephen Foster. Your southern people how you love him for old folk songs. He wrote some of the greatest heartfelt folk songs in the world, and look at him. Every time he--every time... He was considered a neurotic. Every time he'd write a song, then go out and get on a drunk, and finally called a servant and took a razor and committed suicide. He would go up in inspiration. Look at the prophet, Jonah. After being in a ride in the belly of a whale for three days and nights, he come out and preached with such force in the city, that city was the size of St. Louis over here... Said people repented so that they put sack cloth on their animals. Then went up and set down under a--a little old tree up there, a vine, and prayed God 55-0604, Jairus, A Secret Believer, Porter Stadium, Macon, GA, 89 min would take his life.

L-58 Look at the prophet, Elijah. After he stepped on Mount Carmel, and called fire out of heaven, and water out of heaven on the same day, and the great signs he done, and then run out into the wilderness after the vision left him, and was wandering in that wilderness for forty days and nights; and God found him pulled back into a cave. See? Little different maybe than what you read, but see if that isn't true. See? It's the truth. See? It does something to you. No use trying to explain it. You just believe it. That's all. Now, let's... I believe last night we was calling the prayer cards. The boy give out a hundred last night. We called a few of the first ones. Let's go over in kinda the middle of them and start calling tonight somewhere. Let's call from... So we just get a few up here, that's all it takes, just a few to get the Spirit of God moving, and then He just starts moving all over the place. You see? That's all it takes. You don't have to be up here. Don't have nothing to do with it up here.

L-59 I want to just get feel the first night, the people. Every one of you is a human being. Every one of you has a soul, a spirit, and all those spirits are moving; and you touch it, and you feel it. That's the reason Jesus took the man by the hand and led him out of the crowd. That's the reason I said tonight He put everybody out of the house to just go... See, you've got to get them out to yourself until the people really steps in that faith and then it moves everywhere. Let's begin somewhere. Let's see. Let's begin about 51. Who has prayer card, say 51? Do you have... Is that in the aud--audience? Prayer card 51? Look at your card. Do--do you have your prayer card 51? All right. Who has 52? We will start right along like that. Would you come here, sir? 52? Does anybody got prayer card 52? Lady? 53, would you raise up if you have 53? Lady? 54, would you raise up? All right. 55? 56? 56, the lady here? 57? 58? 59? 60? Now, while I'm... Everyone now just be real reverent and just be seated right where you are now. Just keep praying now. Now, up in the audience, ever-where you are. I don't care if you're back row, that won't have anything to do with it. Look this a way and believe and see what happens. Listen for your name. See?

L-60 Listen. How many back up in there is sick tonight? Don't have a prayer card anywhere in the audience anywhere, don't have a prayer card and are sick and want Jesus to heal you? Raise your hand. (See?) Just look. My, I just believe it's going to be so... Now, what you do is do this: Just set around and pray. Be real reverent, just reverent. Don't move around. Just set there and pray, say, "Lord Jesus, I..." Don't--don't strain yourself. Don't get nervous. Just relax. Say, "Oh, Father, I'm so thankful to be in Your Presence out here under the...?... sky. I want You to be merciful to me tonight. I need. Have the preacher just to turn around and speak to me to encourage my faith or something. Let him call me individually. Then just give me the--the encouragement of that Lord, and I will be so thankful." You do that, and approach Him thankfully, reverently, and you'll find out that God will do it for you if you'll do that.

L-61 How many have you out there? Oh, let's just call few more. What--what's the last number that was out there? What's your number, sister? 60? Let's call about five more. 61-2,-3,-4,-5, and that'll make a right nice little line of people. I don't... It doesn't make a difference how many stands up. It's just the idea you don't want too many here now at one time. You see? Cause you have to stand so long, and sometimes I don't get out. The Spirit goes into the audience, and I've got to follow the Spirit. That's all I can do. Now, let's bow our heads just a moment. Every head bowed, and be reverent, just as reverent as you can be. Be faithful, be praying, having faith in God. Oh, have mercy, Lord. I pray Thee to breathe upon this audience tonight of Thy Divine Presence. Make all things possible, Lord. May Thou Holy Spirit move in great, tremendous ways and bless this audience, as we wait reverently in Jesus' Name. Amen.

L-62 Now, let's everyone be reverent and if you're... Now, wait just a moment. I want to look through this audience of people. Do you out there that's in the prayer line, would you look this way just a minute? Each one of you, are you all strangers to me, everyone? If you are, raise up your hands, if you all are strangers. All right. Now, the only ones that I know in the--in the meeting are my associate here, Brother Wood, standing over here. Of course I know him. He's with us. He's the book salesman. Here sets Leo Mercier and Gene Goad down here, friends of 55-0604, Jairus, A Secret Believer, Porter Stadium, Macon, GA, 89 min mine with the my recorders. I... They bring; they have the tapes and so forth, and Brother Beeler here. I know him. He follows the meeting also, and Brother Thoms from South Africa. As far as I know, that's the only people here that I know, outside of my boy standing out there with the sick people. That's the only ones on the grounds that I know of. I met a couple of fine ministers the other day here, brothers of this committee in here, but I wouldn't know them now, I guess, if I'd see them out there. I don't see them, and I just barely remember their--their face that's...?...

L-63 I want to tell everybody just to be real quiet now and keep your children near you, especially epilepsy. Epilepsy is one thing that gets away from me. Do you realize you're dealing with demon spirits? How many realize that? Let's see. Put your hands up anywhere. In the Bible, don't you remember when the man had epilepsy; and somebody went over, and didn't have the authority, and said, "I adjure you by Jesus Who Paul preaches, come out." And that spirit come out and got on the man. Here not long ago there was a certain minister came to a meeting. He had about twenty-eight of his congregation. A little baby was on the platform, and the little baby had epilepsy, had a rag wrapped around a--a--a stick in its mouth, or a clothespin it was. And they had a... The baby was having fits. I couldn't get them to stop, and this minister setting out there kinda smiling unto himself, and I looked around. I told them all put their heads down. They wouldn't do it. This fellow just set there. So an usher went back to him. He said, "Listen, this is a public place, and you... I will do as I please." I said, "All right. It's up to you." I said, "Father, don't let this poor innocent child have to suffer the sins of that man." "Now, Satan, you leave him, but you're at liberty to do what you want to." And thousands of people setting there. There was a whole twenty-eight took epilepsy, and fell on the floor frothing, and everything and still got epilepsy too, and that's just one of the thousands of cases. So you be reverent. We're not playing church. You're in the Presence of God. See? So be reverent. Be seated. And just whatever's said, you do just exactly what the Spirit of the Lord says do.

L-64 Now, shall we just all sing together slowly, if you will, "Only Believe." Just all together now, together. All right. Only believe Now just sing and believe with all your heart now. That's right. There's something that's bothering you...?... ... things are possible, only believe (Each one confessing his faith.) Only believe, only believe, All things are possible, only... I wonder how many will do this with Him? Put up your hand and sing it like this: Now, I believe, all right. Now, I believe, now, I believe, All things are possible, now I believe; Now, I (Heavenly Father, come upon the service this time...?... Help us tonight, Lord, as You minister, may the Angel of...?... Presence of Thee in--in Jesus' Name.)... Now, I believe. [Blank.spot.on.tape--Ed.]

L-65 Now...?... you will. Now just look this a way. Believe with all your heart. Be expecting. Be expecting God to touch your body. He will do it. Now, in the Name of Jesus Christ, the Son of God, I take ever spirit under my control for the glory of God. Mind the Holy Spirit. Here, bring this man here. Now, be reverent as you just walk up this way a little closer, sir. That's all right. Now, to the people in the audience, wherever you are be reverent. Listen for your--for you, 'cause when It goes... Did they show the picture of it here tonight? Did you see it, the Angel of the Lord on--on the picture? I... They'll probably get to it sometime. It--It's here. They taken it and got it in Washington, DC, and It is the only supernatural Being that's ever scientifically proven to be true. The copyright's right with it, the Douglas Studios in Houston, Texas.

L-66 And now, when It leaves, and I see It move over the audience, I have to watch where It is at. And when I speak, you listen for your name, listen for to who it is. Be reverent wherever It is. And when you're standing here, you in the 55-0604, Jairus, A Secret Believer, Porter Stadium, Macon, GA, 89 min prayer line, just listen to what He tells you; then do just exactly. And you'll notice now when It--when I come from... If He anoints me, when I come from It, if it's me speaking, it would be me, but if It is the Holy Spirit and something's to happen, It will say, "THUS SAITH THE LORD." Now, watch that, and you audience, and when It does, mark it down on a little piece of paper or something and watch it. If that don't come to pass, just that way, you send it to me. The recorders here pick up everything. That's what the boys are here for, is to pick up those recordings, you see? We have every word; and not one time since I was a little tiny baby has it ever failed. It can't. It's God. See? If it would be mine, it would fail every time; but It's God, and He can't fail.

L-67 Now, this--a man standing here before me, probably a man my age, maybe a little older. As far as I know, he and I are strangers to each other, are we, sir? We do not know each other, but God knows us both. As soon as you walk up here, I perceive that you are a believer, 'cause your spirit feels welcome; and that's the way I know that. That's a... When Nathanael came up to the Lord Jesus, He said, "Behold an Israelite." See? He knew that he--he was welcome. You see? And just as soon as I turned to you, if you'd been a critic or something, it would have been a dark shadow moving in there; and I knowed they'd been something wrong. But you are a believer, and between you and I now is Something, that perhaps maybe me going under this influence of the Divine Presence of God... I don't know what it... But you're aware that something's taking place. Now, I as an honest man, if you're... Would you raise your hand to the people that they might know that you can tell that you're in the Presence of Something besides man that's Supernatural.

L-68 Now, to anyone who stands this close, between me and the man is that Pillar of Fire like. It's just a circling between me and he. He knows... Now, It'll drop to either he or I in a few moments. He--he knows he's in the Presence, in Divine Presence. I do not know the man. I have never seen him; but now if the Holy Spirit should anoint, why, He will tell you something that will encourage you or discourage you one. That I do not know. It'll have to take Him to do it, but if He does, you will admit it then; if it's truth, you'll admit it. And you'll be willing to do anything that He tells you to do? And if it's the truth what He tells you, then you know that His Divine Presence is here a telling me what to say to you. Isn't that right? Well, may He grant it, is my sincere prayer, brother. You're the first patient here tonight. People with lots of faith in the audience, and they're moving from everywhere. Powers of sickness is moving in, and it's people's faith a doing it. See? It isn't me. It's their own faith pulls that. It wasn't Jesus healed the woman. He said, "Thy faith has saved thee." See? If wasn't--it wasn't Him. Her faith did it, and that's the same thing in here. Faith pulling from everywhere around now...

L-69 But I see that between you and I there seems to be something like dripping. I see it moving between you and I, like drops of something a falling. It's a--it's a blood condition. It's something in the blood. It's--it's acids in your blood, I believe the doctor says. It's a... I see that kinda a thin fellow says, "It's a--a acid in your blood, and it's caused by a case of diabetes." It has been diabetes that's caused the acid to come into your blood. Is that right? [Man says, "That's right. That's the truth. That is the truth."--Ed.] Now, you--you believe? Now, see, more you talk to the man... See? Now that you might know, now I could just pray for you. I don't know, but I turn around now while the anointing is speaking and talk to the man, He might... Just longer you talk with... Usually I don't say much to a person, 'cause there's others, and it just weakens so. But that you might know now. Now, we will just talk to the brother just a little bit longer, see if the Holy Spirit would say anything.

L-70 Would you desire to see that if it be God's will? Pray that it'll be God's will. That we might know just to--to talk to you now. Now, what It said was the truth. We will see just what He would say again, and if He should say anything, 'course it would be Him. It couldn't be me. You know that. You realize that, but ever what it was, 'course it seems to--a dream now. It's another world. I see it moving between us again. I know it's a--it's another man, and the man's got something that's in his eyes, about a... Oh, it's a--it's a son. You got a boy or something or a son, haven't you? It's got something wrong with his eyes. And then you... I see a little girl. That's his daughter which is your granddaughter. She's got something wrong with her eyes. You believe? Now, as you have believed, go, and find it just the way you believe it. In the Name of the Lord Jesus, I 55-0604, Jairus, A Secret Believer, Porter Stadium, Macon, GA, 89 min bless my brother for the glory of God. May the Lord bless you, my dear brother.

L-71 Just have faith. Believe God with all your heart. You can have what you want if you'll just have faith to believe it. [Blank.spot.on.tape--Ed.] All right. Now, as far as that is concerned, the whole audience ought to have faith now to be healed. Isn't that right? Every one should have faith. Every one should believe. I see the Angel of the Lord hanging over a little lady, looking right at me, praying. Got trouble with your hip, haven't you, sister? You was praying then. You said, "Lord, let him turn to me." You also have a hernia, don't you? That's right, and you got a tumor, haven't you? If that's right, raise up your hand. Now, you stand up on your feet. Jesus Christ, the Son of God, heals you, and you're a well; your faith has made you whole. Just have faith. Keep praying; keep believing. Don't doubt. Believe all things are possible. Oh, how marvelous, how wonderful our Lord Jesus is.

L-72 Now, is this the lady? Is this the lady that they brought? I see you have a sign, "Personal Worker." Are you working in this meeting, are you, lady? All right. We're strangers to each other, I suppose. This is our first time ever meeting in life, but the Lord Jesus Christ knows both of us, doesn't He? He knows me; He knows you. He knows everything that I ever did do, all you ever did do. He knows what I will do. He knows what you will do. So our destination lays within His grips, in His hands. And only He alone is able to do this. Are you aware of that, sister? Well, us being strange to each other and only God alone can do these things, then if I talk to you like our Lord and Master, which is present now, talked to the woman at the well... He said, "Bring Me a drink." And He begin to carry a conversation with her, till He found out just exactly where her trouble was. He found one trouble with her; that was: she was living in adultery. He said, "Go, get your husband." She said, "I don't have any." Said, "You got five." She said, "I perceive that You're a Prophet." Said, "I know that when Messiah cometh, He will tell us these things."

L-73 That was the very sign of the Messiah. Was that right? That's the sign of the Messiah today. Is that right? For the Messiah is the same yesterday, today, and forever. He's the same in principle, same in power, same in works. And the Messiah, Himself, said, "I do nothing except the Father shows Me first what to do." But I'm talking to you just like He did to her, catching your human spirit, and us being strangers. Now, the first thing, I see the woman (if the audience, if my voice is loud enough now, as I hope it is) I see the woman moving away from me. She... There's something wrong with her spine. She's got a spinal trouble, and her spine is bad. That is true. Isn't it, lady? If that's right, raise up your hand. See how infallible our Holy Spirit of God is. There's your trouble. Just exactly. Now, whether God can heal or not, that depends on her faith. See? These things are not to heal people. It's to bring you conscious of God being here. See?

L-74 Now, you can say that man's a--a--anything you want to call it. Whatever you call it, it'll determine your destination. I say that. See? Whatever... The man that smote Jesus in the face didn't feel any virtue. Certainly not. But the woman who touched His garment felt virtue. You touch Him tonight, not me. Not, oh, my, don't--don't think that: not me, Him. See? I--I'm just as you are. Now, worse than you are, lower, 'cause you people's been in this way a long time. I'm just a baby in it (See?), and you just call me your brother, and I come to you. But some of you old saints of God here's been in these old churches around here, carrying their cross for years and years. I feel honored to stand before you, so I'm sure without a shadow of a doubt, I'm presenting the Lord Jesus Christ to you. That's right. Now, if you believe it, I hope you do.

L-75 Now, the lady. Let's see what--what did--oh, it is, spinal trouble, I believe it was. All right. Now, that's what is wrong. Now, if I'd talk to the lady a little longer, it would keep telling her more things or whatever. It might. I don't know. We will just talk to her a minute and see what the Holy Spirit would say. So that you can see, that it's just not something you're guessing. It's a reality. Now, it just... He's such a marvelous Lord Jesus, so wonderful. Now, it left me just then. It moved out from me. I felt It 55-0604, Jairus, A Secret Believer, Porter Stadium, Macon, GA, 89 min go. It went to someone. Now, just as sure as anything. It left some--went to someone. The Anointing left me; Life went out. Look at the perspiration breaking on top of my hand. See, see? It went from me. Somebody in the audience... Let's see.

L-76 Now, here... Now, if you that feel that you're in the Spirit... Now, look standing right here. Do you see that Light? It's hanging right over a little lady setting here, looking at me. She's been suffering. I see her going about something, holding her head. She's having headaches. Been having headaches. She's setting right in here. Do you believe that the Lord Jesus heals you? Will make you well? You accept it and you believe it? If you do, you may have it. The Lord Jesus bless you. See? You don't need prayer cards. See? You need faith. Faith does the work. See, how faith makes you whole.

L-77 Now, this is the patient, I believe. So we will... what... If we will just... He just spoke to you, didn't He, telling you something was wrong with you. Now, do you believe Him with all your heart that He will heal you? With all your heart, you believe you'll get... I see you--you've been... I see some building, a kind of a building you've been into or something. You was com... It's a--it's a--it's a hospital. You've just come from a hospital, and it was a--a... You--you've got a blood pressure. I see them taking your pressure like this, and it's dangerously high, ready for a stroke. That is right, and they's--they's a little girl with you, and that little girl has something wrong with her foot. It's crippled in its foot, the left foot I believe it is. I see it as it throws its left foot, and that little girl is the daughter of your niece. That's right, and that lady, the mother of the child, works in a hospital. That's the truth. Now, go lay your hand on the child, and may the Lord grant unto you the desire of your heart.

L-78 Let us say, "Praise be to God." God is a worship an object of worship. "They that worship Him, worship in Spirit and in Truth." You believe with all your heart? If you believe, you can receive whatever it is. Just have faith in God. God will grant to you the blessings if you'll believe it. Oh, my. This lady setting right here having, looking around this a way, do you believe with all your heart that God will heal you of that hay fever? You believe that God will make you well? Kinda shocked you a little, didn't it? You believe that He will make you well? If you do, you can have what you ask for. Amen. High blood pressure? You believe that God will heal you of that high blood pressure? If you believe it, you can have what you ask for. That's right. God bless you. Amen.

L-79 How do you do, lady? We're strangers to each other, aren't we? Now, we being strangers to one another, but yet, you know that you're in the Presence of something besides your brother, don't you? See? It's His Presence. You see? Isn't that a wonderful feeling? See, It just settling now, coming between me and the woman. She moves way back. A dark streak follows her. I see her many years ago. She's much younger than she is. You were stricken with something or other that looks like that they couldn't... You was asleep, or you--a sleeping disease. That's what you had, and it's come back on you again, and you're getting to a place where you're all excited. I see you wondering about whether you should drive a car and things like that. You're being worried about those things. Isn't that the truth? You believe that God's going to make you whole this minute? Come here. And heavenly Father, as Your Spirit here that knows all things, I pray God that You'll bless this woman, who I bless in Thy Name; and may she go and be whole in Jesus Christ's Name. Amen. God bless you, sister. May His mercies rest with you and be upon you.

L-80 How do you do, lady? We are strange to each other too, I suppose? And we do not know each other, but God knows us both. Isn't that right? If He knows us both, He knows all things. He can do all things. He's omnipotent, omnipresent. So He's all present, all omnipotent. He can do all things. I see you not sometime ago. You was going; you went for an examination and was examined for cancer, and you're going back again. Have to go back soon to get a examination to test again to see if it's cancer. That's right. That you might know that I am your brother and telling you the truth, you got someone you're interested in. That's a blind person. That's your daughter, and she's a blind person. The handkerchief that you have in your hand lay it on her, then bring us 55-0604, Jairus, A Secret Believer, Porter Stadium, Macon, GA, 89 min word what your doctor tells you about the cancer. You'll find that it's all right. God bless you, my sister. May His mercy rest upon you. Praise be to God Who gives all things freely. Whosoever will may come and drink from the waters, the fountains of Life freely. Praise God. Every spirit's subject. See, I... He... You couldn't hide yourself now. He's here. If you'd look this a way I pass my... I couldn't heal you, but you couldn't hide your life. That's right.

L-81 Here lays an elderly lady looking at me. I know what's wrong with her. She has palsy. Her husband setting by her is hard of hearing. Here's a lady setting here with a gallbladder trouble, just come from a hospital. The little girl over there in the wheelchair's got polio: stricken. Have faith. Believe. That's what it takes. I can't heal. God never give me something to heal somebody. He give me a gift to--to stimulate your faith in Him, to know He's present. What do you think in there, lady, setting there on the end of the seat, setting there with that liver trouble? Do you believe that Jesus Christ heals you then? You felt something went over you, wasn't it? That's It. You were healed. Amen. That lady that laid her hand over her, she got a blessing too at that time, because she had a--a bladder trouble; and she was healed then. Amen. That's right. That's exactly right.

L-82 The lady setting next to her, hugging up against her shoulders, you--you got a rupture, haven't you, lady? That's right. Amen. See, you can't hide His Presence. He's here. Amen. Hallelujah to the Lamb of the living God. "I'm present. Wherever two or more are gathered in My Name, I will be in their midst. Whatsoever thing you shall ask in prayer that will I do." Listen. I am not a fanatic. God knows that. Our heavenly Father, Who looks down in heaven, I'm looking at that audience back in front of me there; and the God of heaven Who will judge me at this day of the judgment when He comes, constantly the Light of God is flashing from that audience back in there. You're--it's bending out. I'm getting so weak I can hardly stand here, but many people back in there are getting healed.

L-83 Now, you're too far back for me to just see exactly who you are, but God in heaven knows that. Many times has It flashed over the people there, and I know It's God's sign to me that them people are being healed right along through there, and God knows that's the truth, as I stand by His sacred Word. Amen. Watch. Long time after I'm gone, you'll find out that that's the truth. Amen. It's your faith a doing that. Praise be to God. I love Him. How wonderful He is. We just thank Him with all our hearts for His goodness, don't we? Just waiting a moment, friends. Just, you don't realize what it is. You get into a... Oh, He is so wonderful. You just feel like you're going to take a rapture just... My, how great it is to know that the Anointing of the Holy Spirit that will take the Church in the rapture someday is present. Now, the people that's called the people that believes in God fanatics and holy-rollers, you ought to be ashamed of yourself, for God is with them a vindicating He's here. Look at when Israel come up out of Egypt. The sign was before them to prove that God was with them. Amen. How we love Him. How we praise Him for His goodness. He's from everlasting to everlasting. He's God.

L-84 This man standing here, is this the patient? Excuse me, sir. We're strangers to each other, I suppose. I do not know you. But just watching... I didn't mean to make you wait, sir, but just... I can't explain it. See? You're here. I don't know why. He knows why you're here, and He's the only One that can heal you if you're sick. If it's financial troubles, He's the only One that can support it. If it's domestic troubles, He's the only One Who can clear it up. The only thing I can do, is just by a Divine gift. if He will, say the same thing like He did to the woman at the well... He knew where her troubles lay. Now, I want to ask the audience. A man standing here, total stranger... Something happened in the audience just then. It went out to the audience. If the Holy Spirit, this strange man to me, will reveal what he come here for, will every one of you accept it now that you... Will you believe that I--I have told you the truth about the Lord Jesus. Will you? (See?)

L-85 Is it true, sir, we are strangers to each other? We never met before in life. This is just our first meeting time. I know nothing about you? Then if anything, if there's something wrong with you, and God would let me know about it, 55-0604, Jairus, A Secret Believer, Porter Stadium, Macon, GA, 89 min then it'd have to come from the hand of God, wouldn't it? And now... See audience, this now... I want you to keep the Word. You on these cots here that's sick, wherever you are, and if I could only do something for you to heal you, how I would love to come down there and do it, but I can't. I can't do it. No other man can do it. It's your faith in God. Every sinner here, how I'd like to come out and save you, but I can't. It's your own faith in God. Your--your--your salvation was paid for at Calvary. You've been... Ever since Jesus died, you've been saved, but it'll never do you any good till you accept it. Your healing was paid for at Calvary. Can't you accept it now? See, a man can come through here saying anything. That don't make it so, but when God says it's so, then it's--it's--it's so. What that was, I could feel it. My brethren here, it's time to leave this stadium about, and that's the reason I'm trying to get the crowd into a position where I can feel that the Anointing is correctly over ever person. I'm interested in you, friend. I want you to be well. I--I--you're just--you're somebody's mother. I got a dear old mother praying tonight. You're somebody's wife. I got a wife praying tonight, somebody's father. My father's gone on tonight. Somebody's brother and sister... Oh, may God help you, friend. Now, through preaching the Word, through seeing God moving, won't you believe? I persuade you to have faith in God. Now while I try, as the crowd is getting dim. I can't explain it, or can't even know where my voice is coming to you correctly or not, but I trust that it is.

L-86 Now, to the man, if he will just step this way just a little closer, sir. There's somebody behind you pulling the same way. So we being strangers to each other, as I have said, God knowing both of us, knowing all about us... Do you notice just how many in audience gets healed to one at the platform, is because of their faith. You see? Their faith does that. Now, you're not from this city. You've come here from another city, and your trouble lays in your back; and he told you that it was a ruptured disk in your back. That is right. You believe the Lord Jesus can make you well? I hear somebody call you by name out--Hugh and your other name is Martin. That's right, isn't it? All right, go ahead. It's--it's over now. God bless you.

L-87 Let us say, "Praise be to God." Do you believe Him with all your heart? Now, let's us just where you're standing. I want you to do something for me. Will you, everybody sick, just put your hands over on each other just a minute, will you? Everywhere, all the way around. That's right. Now, I know God... Glory. All these things... God just healed a man setting there. Your hands... "They shall lay hands on each other." Our heavenly Father, we rebuke all the powers of darkness. Satan, you are defeated. We come against thee tonight in the Name of the Lord Jesus, and by the authority of the Holy Ghost, and the power of the resurrected Lord Jesus. This group of believers comes into the Presence of the Almighty. Come out, Satan, I adjure thee in the Name of Jesus, leave every person in Divine Presence. You're defeated. Leave them in Jesus' Name. Amen. Stand up now on your feet and give God praise for His great glorious power. Courtesy of Living Word Broadcast P. O.
