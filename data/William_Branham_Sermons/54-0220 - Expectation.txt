--- TRANSCRIPT ---

L-1 ... in doing so it makes us all kinda relax. And some people in the ministry of this type, they begin to think, maybe, you'd be some kind of a super person or something. I want you to know: I'm just your brother (See?), just a man (See?), just your brother. Just... Nothing but just a human, like we all are. And God just give me a little ministry to help somebody, so I just go do the best I can with it, and that's the best that I know. So then, I thought last night, talking about...?... with horses and so forth, and riding, why, you'd realize that we're just--just mortal beings together, trying our best to do what we can for the Kingdom of God and for the glory of His dear Son, Jesus Christ.

L-2 And such a respond, though, my, that was marvelous. I thought I'd... Really the meetings was set up for, was for just Gospel preaching. I'm... And then when you get around where the... and mention the coming... the Lord has blessed so greatly in the praying for the sick, until people have just... Really, when they come, they expect the prayer meeting for the sick. You can... Sometime I get off an airplane somewhere, or going somewhere traveling, here would be somebody over there motioning, got that ambulance setting out there with somebody sick to be prayed for, out at the airport. They know the plane's going to come down or something. So that's real nice, I... That's... I appreciate that. If people's got that much faith in God, to believe it. That's very, very nice. And so, I--I'm thankful for it, and I pray that God will bless.

L-3 I just shook hands with a young fellow coming in there, a young boy, if he's here, I don't mean to make him conspicuous. A very fine young fellow said, "Brother Branham, I was raised up in a Christian home." He said, "I'd taken the habit of smoking, and--and I use bad words." He said, "Brother Branham, I want to be right with God. Would you pray that..." See, bring up a child in the way it should go. They get off amongst these children doesn't have that kind of teaching, they wander away, but don't worry, God will bring them back. I believe it.

L-4 A brother setting here, said, "Brother Branham, don't you remember down in Phoenix, at a basement in the auditorium one time, you prayed for my wife who was insane?" (I just remembered) Said, "She's here with us tonight." Said, "She's in her right mind." Oh, I wonder if the woman's close, if she'd stand up. Is this the minister, I believe, or somewhere here? It's a... Yes, his--his wife, that was healed in Phoenix. Reminds me of the time at--in Little Rock, Arkansas. I believe it was one of the worst cases of insanity that I ever seen in my life. And someone testified of it in the meeting.

L-5 I'd just been... (If you want confirmation of this, you might write the chairman of the committee, which was Rev. G. H. Brown, of Little Rock, Arkansas, 505 Victor Street; Rev. G. H. Brown.) And we were praying, and it was about... got late and I was so tired; that was just before I had my time where they just let me have, they just let me stay until... liked to kill me. So I was amazed that night. There was an old fellow out in the meeting there, he was--had crutches about like the brother here that's...?... his feet sitting on. He'd had been crippled for a long time. And during time of the service, the Lord Jesus made him whole. And the next day he was walking around on the street, holding his crutches in front of him, saying, "The Lord took me off of this last night." So...?... Oh, my. The papers give me really write up, said, "A self-styled Baptist preacher, jamming the streets with ambulances and cars: such fanaticism."

L-6 This old brother... I was standing, speaking, like this, and he raised up and said, "Say, Brother Branham, I want to ask you a question." All out of order... But I said, "All right, brother, what is it?" He said, "I'm just so happy, I don't know what to do." 54-0220, Expectation, East Alton -Wood River Community High School, Wood River, IL, 89 min I said, "Well, that's fine." He said, "You know, the strange thing though," said, "when I heard you preaching, I was sure you was a Nazarene." 'Cause he was a Nazarene himself, you know. He said, "I--I'd sure you was a Nazarene." And then, said, "I seen all these Pentecostal people around here, and somebody told me you were Pentecostal." And said, "Now, I heard you say just awhile ago, you was a Baptist." Said, "I--I can't understand it." I said, "That's very easy." I said, "I'm a Pentecostal, Nazarene, Baptist." And I said... [Brother Branham and congregation laugh--Ed.] We're all one in Christ Jesus. Amen...?...

L-7 That night, Mr. Brown told me, said, "Brother Branham, as soon as you... wait for a little break, to rest up again." They'd let me rest up a few minutes. I'd get real numb all over, then they'd take me off and let me rest a few minutes, just sing songs, and a preacher, maybe, would preach a little sermonette. I'd rest up a little and come back. So it... I hadn't been out praying for the sick then, but just, oh, two or three months. So they taken me off, and said, "I want to show you a sight like you've never seen." I said, "What is it?" Said, "An insane woman."

L-8 And I went down, and standing on the steps as I went down, at the bottom of the auditorium. They couldn't hear down there, only through a PA system, it was so packed in. But nobody was in that spot, in the floor, 'cause they couldn't get in there on account of this woman. And she was laying on the floor, and her limbs were sticking right up like this, arms and legs both, and she was bleeding all over. And her husband was standing on the steps, a very fine, just a typical good old Arkansas brother, standing there with a pair of overalls on, them washed out. He said... I tell you, friend, talk about overalls and blue shirts, some of the best old hearts in the world beat beneath them. That's right. That's right. And he--he shook my hand. He said... Oh, I said, "What's your trouble?" Said, "It's my wife, Brother Branham." And I looked out there, and she was laying like that. I said, "Oh, my." I said, "What's she bleeding so for?"

L-9 Said, "Well, Brother Branham," said, "we heard that testimony from over at Pinewood over there, that that woman was brought from the insane institution was healed." Said, "We thought maybe if we could bring my wife." He said, "We got her dismissed for tonight," and said, "they..." about a hundred and something miles. He said, "The ambulance wouldn't touch it." And said, "I got two or three brothers to come with me, and we got her in the Chevrolet car," and said, "she overcome all those men and kicked through the glass and broke all the windows out, and that's what cut her (See?) from the glass." I said, "Oh, my, that's too bad." And I said, "How did it come about, brother?" He said, "Well, Brother Branham," said, "it's just the time of menopause. The doctor give her shots that run her into that." I said, "Well, that's sure too bad." And I said, "Well, 'course he didn't aim to do it; he done the best that he knowed how."

L-10 And he said, "Well, she's been up here in the insane institution for two years." Said, "Brother Branham, she's a good woman." Said, "I got five little children." Said, "Right after this," said, "it was--her baby was born during the time of the menopause." Said, "She was such an awful fix." He said, "We... I sold my farm and everything else." He said, "And really," said, "I had a team left... I was working around." Said, "I sold them mules so I could get some money to help bring her down here tonight. His two mules, what he had..." I said, "Oh, brother, that sure is too bad." I said, "I'll walk out and talk to her." He said, "Oh, don't you do that, Brother Branham," said, "she'll kill you." I said--I said, "Well, I'll talk to her." Said, "Why, she don't even know her own name; she hasn't spoke a word in two years."

L-11 "Oh," I said, "I believe I can talk to her." (Just a kid like in the ministry. I--I didn't know then what... realize now you better wait and let God say so.) So I just walked out in the room. She was just...?... laying on her back. Said she hadn't been off her back in two years, just laid like that. And she had her hands up like that, and I walked right out there, 54-0220, Expectation, East Alton -Wood River Community High School, Wood River, IL, 89 min said, "Good evening, sister." She just laid there with her eyes back and... I reached around, I said, "How do you do?" and took a hold of her hand. Oh, my. It was a good thing that God was with me. Would... Anybody that's demon possessed is many times their strength, you know. She just grabbed my hand like that, real quick. And I used to be a boxer. I had the undefeated title of bantam weight championship of the three states, so--and know what grip is. But she grabbed me like that, and she grabbed like that, and when she did, if I hadn't have threw my foot out real quick and caught her across the bosom with my foot to hold myself, she'd have... Why, she'd have probably broke my bones right there on the floor, where she jerked me like that. And it pulled her hand loose like that, and she let out a great big blow like a--like a--a crocodile or something, making a big blow, a funny noise [Brother Branham blows into the microphone--Ed.] like that. Now, my, and then she started turning around. Why, I--I started away from her. And when she did, she started chasing me, like a snake crawling on the floor; you could hear it just--just like--like crawling, where she... And she chased me back up on the steps like that. And there she was crawling around down on the floor. And I said, "My."

L-12 Now, it's only the grace of God, or--or to be that way...?... you women, or man too (See?), just God's grace. And when she put her big strong limbs up against the--the side of the wall like that, and she backed up to the wall like that, and give a great big kick, and when she did, she went out on the floor and hit a bench, was sitting out there, and the side of her head... A nice, attractive looking lady, about forty-five years old, and hit her head like this, and the hair. And blood flew when it hit, and broke a piece of the bench off. Now, she had so much power in those legs to kick herself out like that. And a piece of the bench flew off, and she picked it in her hands like that, and threw it. Just missed her husband, and just tore the plastering off the wall. I said, "Oh, my. She's in an awful shape." He said, "Yes." He said, "Now, Brother Branham, would you have to lay hands on her?" I said, "I--I wish I could." And he started crying. He said, "Now, I don't know what..."

L-13 I said, "Look, brother. Uh-uh, it's not me; Jesus Christ does the healing." I said, "If you will believe with all of your heart that God will heal that woman... And the story that I told about a few weeks ago, that Angel meet me up there, and telling me to go and be sincere when I prayed, get the people to believe me." And I said, "They won't believe me." He said, "There'll be given you signs, like was given the prophet Moses, two signs." You remember the story. And said, "If you get the people to believe you, nothing shall stand before the prayer." I said, "Sir, do you believe that?" And he put his old bony arm around me, said, "Brother Branham, with all my heart I believe it."

L-14 I turned around like this, and when I did, that woman squared off the same way. She said, "William Branham, you have nothing to do with me." And the man said, "Well, that's the first words she spoke in two years." I said, "That's not her." She said... He said, "How did she know you?" I said, "That's not her; that's that devil screaming out. See?...?..." I said, "That's Satan. She wouldn't know I was William Branham. He said he recognizes that I've told the truth. And if you'll only believe, you'll see the glory of God."...?... And he said, "You have nothing to do with me. I brought her here." I said, "You might've brought her here, but Jesus Christ will heal her."

L-15 And she started crawling up towards me. And I said, "Let's bow our heads." And as we bowed our heads, and I said, "Heavenly Father, this poor brother and this... brought his wife here in this condition. You're the same God that... those devils and legions You cast out." I said, "You're the same God, so I ask in Jesus Christ Name that the evil spirits come out of the woman." And I just turned around to the man and said, "Do you believe?" He said, "With all of my heart, Brother Branham." 54-0220, Expectation, East Alton -Wood River Community High School, Wood River, IL, 89 min I said, "Now, see, He told me if you get the people to believe, be sincere, and brother," I said, "I'm just as sincere as I knowed how to be." He said, "Thank you, Brother Branham." He said, "What must I do with her?" I said, "Take her right back to the institution." He said, "All right." So I said, "You let them dismiss her." So he turned around, and after the service, he taken her back. And the thing of it was, she never bothered no one going back, sat up nicely. Went back, they put her in the institution next morning. And the following morning when they went into the cell, where she was at, to feed her, she was setting up. And on the third day she was dismissed from the sanatorium, sent home in her normal mind.

L-16 About two months after that, I was at Little Rock, or not Little Rock, but Jonesboro. And setting... I kept seeing someone waving at me, like that, in the meeting. I thought, "Well, I don't remember them people," and I was preaching. And I looked again, and I thought, "Well..." And so the lady raised up, or the man did, rather, and said... had some little children there, said, "Do you know us, Brother Branham?" I said, "I don't believe I do." Said... The lady said... She raised up too; she said, "Excuse me, Brother Branham," but said, "they tell me that I was laying on my back the last time you seen me." And I said, "Were you healed somewhere?" And she said, "Yes. I was the lady that was down in the basement in that..." I said, "Oh, my." And there she was with her five little children hugging at her, normal and well in her right mind.

L-17 What is it? Jesus Christ the same yesterday, today, and forever; made the lame to walk, the blind to see, the deaf to hear, devils would be cast out, and the commission follows on. Amen. And that thing is perhaps being done around the world tonight among faithful, believing members of the Body of Jesus Christ; and Divine healing doesn't lay within me. And each of these brethren setting here, your pastor, you don't have to wait till they have a Divine healing program to be healed. Every one of these men has got just the same authority that I or anyone else has got to pray for the sick. And that's all we can do, is pray for the sick. And not only them, but if they're off somewhere and can't get to you, that good Holy Ghost filled sister or brother that lives next door to you has the same authority (That's right.), same thing. If you can't get to your pastor... The Bible said, "If any among you sick, call the elders of the church, let them anoint the oil, and pray over the sick. The prayer of faith shall save the sick." Said, "God shall raise them up." Not the minister--God shall raise them up. "And if they did any sin, it shall be forgiven them. Confess your faults one to another, and pray one for the other." Is that right? One another be prayed for. See? "That you may be healed. For the effectual fervent prayer of a righteous man availeth much." That's all you need. Be filled with God's Spirit. And you'd be surprised if you only knowed the gifts that setting right in this building tonight. Yes, sir.

L-18 Now, if I would know sickness, surely I would know gifts. Is that right? That's right. So I--I know that in meetings when I meet with Christian people, they are there. The only thing, you have to watch when you tell people, 'cause they hold right onto your word; they'll say something, and you have to know it's directly coming from God what to tell the person. That's the reason, don't say those things. You see? But you just live humble before God, just be... Don't try to make yourself anything. Just be humble. God will take care of the rest of it. See? He will make it known.

L-19 Now tomorrow, to our sorrow, I wish that really from the depth of my heart that I would set the meeting a little longer, if we could've got it, for at least another week. I feel like if I could take next week, just about four days of just common Gospel preaching and altar calls, it'd would be hard telling what would take place. After the people is already minded of the power of the deliverance of God, then every one of you bring your sinner friend out next week, that would be real then; we--we could win souls for Christ. Usually, in these meetings it's just the Christians come. Now 54-0220, Expectation, East Alton -Wood River Community High School, Wood River, IL, 89 min and then sinners come in, but usually, just the Christians. And then the--the believer already believes. See? So I just trust that it'll be God's will for me to come back again to you real soon. Sure got a fine bunch of brethren, and fine... I've never, any time at any place, ever felt any more cooperation in the Spirit of God, than I have right here at this place. That's right. That's right. That's true. I've never seen a place I've ever been before that ministers set behind me on the platform. And that's... The first night it kinda bothered me a little 'cause I was conscience of them being there, but just that wall of faith there, I said just leave them alone. That--that's fine; they're my brothers. That's--that's wonderful, and I'm so happy for that. When you get that faith there to believe, so just anything can happen.

L-20 Now, we thank you for everything, and tomorrow afternoon, if you can, I think the services begin at two o'clock. Is that right? Two o'clock. That'll let me be here by two-thirty, perhaps. And I'll speak a little while and then pray for the sick. And then... You've been very nice in your attendance, and rain, bad nights you've come anyhow. And you've helped us with the finance to pay the debts. I think they'll have it all together. Mr. Brewer's going to give it to my son tonight, and the expenses to be paid, and if there's enough not to pay all the expenses, it'll be paid in the morning. If not, why, after my love offering's taken up tomorrow, it'll be made in, and it'll be paid. If it's not, which... I believe, it's already more than paid. And if there's any left over, whatever it is, I will not take it myself; I'll stick it right over in foreign missions, to send across the sea, and do everything that I can. If it lacks a little, then I'll, from my love offering, I'll make it up. See?

L-21 Now, we want to leave without debts owing, everybody feeling wonderful and fine, and glorifying God. We try to keep that standard everywhere. And all the ministers, and the people here... If you're here and you don't belong to a church, why don't you join with these brother's church, if you live near them. You believe in this type of ministry, well, join the churches that believe in that. Go and join the churches that backs that up, that believe in that. See? And you come over and get healed, and go back into a bunch of people where that atmosphere is, that doesn't believe in Divine healing and things, why, you'll be just as bad off as you ever was. See? That's right. Yoke yourself right up among unbelievers. That's what the Bible said. Is that right? But believers... And so, I wish you could do that. And I pray that you will.

L-22 Now. Now, if your church is a believer in Divine healing, and believing the blessings of God... See, your church doesn't save you. Jesus is your Saviour. But if... You'll do a lot better if you get among people... And if you do believe in Divine healing and living among those who doesn't believe in Divine healing, you're indebtiment to them. That's right. Always said... You know, people say, "Do I have to quit this, Brother Branham, if I'm going to join the Full Gospel churches? Will I have to give up shows, dances, and so forth?" No. Don't have to give up anything. Not a thing. We're nearly all northern people here. We have little scrub oaks out here; they hold their leaves all winter long. When springtime comes, you all don't have to go out and take off the old leaves so the new ones can come on. Just let the new life come up, and the old leaves goes off anyhow. So you don't... You don't have to have a measuring stick; just get new life in there; it'll take care of itself. That's right. The old things just fade away and the new life comes on.

L-23 Over in the Gospel of Luke, the 2nd chapter the 25th verse, I want to read just a little portion of Scripture. You're so lovely, I just hate to pass a night without speaking to you for a few moments. When I come back, we're going to try to add some of them along, so we can have some afternoon services and just preach the Gospel and have a wonderful time. Behold, there was a man in Jerusalem, whose name was Simeon;... the same man was just and devout, waiting... the consolation of Israel: and the Holy Ghost was upon him. It was revealed unto him by the Holy Ghost, that he should not see death, before he had seen the Lord's Christ. And he came by the Spirit into the temple: and when the parent brought... the child Jesus, to do for him after the custom of the law, Then took he him up in his arms, and blessed God, and said, Lord, now let... thy servant depart in peace, according to thy word: For my eyes have seen thy salvation, 54-0220, Expectation, East Alton -Wood River Community High School, Wood River, IL, 89 min

L-24 Now, can we bow our heads just a moment. Kind heavenly Father, we're grateful to Thee tonight that we have this approach to Thee through the Name of Thy beloved Child, Jesus Christ, Who has redeemed us from sin. Oh, we think of... We were one time alienated from God, Gentiles cut off from God, the commonwealth of Israel, led about worshipping idols. And in due season Christ came and died, the innocent for the guilty. And through the shedding of His holy Blood and the right to the Tree of Life, we, Gentiles, are now brought nigh, insomuch that we're called sons and daughters of God. "And it does not yet appear just what we'll be in the final end, but we know we'll have a body like His Own glorious body, for we shall see Him as He is." Free from sin, free from sickness, worry, troubles, old age, it'll all be finished then. O come, Lord Jesus, and help me tonight to press--spread this Gospel around the world so You can come. You cannot come, according to Your Word, until all the world has heard the Gospel. I pray that You'll hasten the day, Lord, that when all the world shall hear the Gospel; sin and sorrow, pain and death of this dark world shall cease. Till then, give us grace. Give us vision; give us power to bring the Gospel to the people.

L-25 Before me tonight, Lord, is a box of handkerchiefs. And as I lay my hands upon them, nothing within Thy servant to do this, but as a memorial, or a token to the Word of Jesus Christ, which said, that these signs should follow the believer: if they laid hands on the sick, they should recover. And the great Saint Paul took from his body, handkerchiefs and aprons, and sickness left the people, and devils went out of them. And I pray that You'll heal every one. Watch over them, Lord. May the Angel of God watch these handkerchiefs, till they're gone to the right place. And may when they're placed upon the sick, may every one, without leaving one out, may every one be perfectly normal. Grant it, Father, for we send it in Jesus' Christ Name. Amen.

L-26 I've asked that God will bless you all. And I want to speak just a moment, and then we'll--we'll start praying for the sick. Now, first, we want to think tonight on this text, if I would call it a text, just for a few moments. And I would like to use these words in it: "Expectations." As I mentioned here the other night, you usually get what you expect, don't you? If you come tonight to the meeting, just expecting to see something that you could criticize the meeting about, the devil will show you plenty of it. You'll go back with a lot of criticism just like you expected. But if you come tonight expecting, just say, "Lord, I come to see You. I come for the benefit of... to be healed. I come for the benefit of my soul. Well, I expect You to give it to me, 'cause I'm here in this place that's dedicated to Your--to Your glory." And you'll get just what you expect. That's right. You always... And you can never go above your expectations. You'll always have to do that.

L-27 Now, expectancy... We see here that when Jesus was born in Bethlehem of Judaea, there wasn't the press, like we have radio and television, and so forth, as we have now. So the news had to be taken from lip to ear. And then... (Can you hear me in the back in the balcony up there? Is it all right? Can you hear around this?) The expectations... And then, when Jesus was born... There's usually singing when a king is born. So there was no greetings here on the earth, people to greet Him, so the angels came down and sang; rejoicing, as today in the City of David, is born Christ the Saviour. God's angelic host, who couldn't understand the mystery of this virgin birth, but yet, sang, Praises to God in the highest, peace on earth, good will to men, when they sang at His birth. How marvelous.

L-28 Then we notice again, a way back in the East some magis, or star gazers... I believe they'd noticed the prophecy of Balaam, that a star of Jacob would rise. And they would... they was watching for that star to arise. And we're told by historians that the three magi... They come from different parts, not followed one star, as the Christian tradition has it, but they followed three different stars. And when they met at the Bethlehem of Judaea, all three coming from the East, traveling from three different places, they never knew each other until they met. And they consolid--counseled, rather, with one another. And one of them was from the lineage of Ham, the other one from Shem, and Japheth: three sons of Noah. And these three stars that they'd had followed, went together and made the one big star that hung over Christ. Jesus said when this Gospel is preached to Ham, Shem, and Japheth's people, then the end shall come.

L-29 All right. When they consolidated and come together... Now, all the observatories they had in that day, not one of 54-0220, Expectation, East Alton -Wood River Community High School, Wood River, IL, 89 min them saw the star. And yet, on every city there was a tower, an observatory, that watched the stars. They kept time by the stars. Watches and things wasn't in--in time then. So only thing they had was a sundial in the day and stars at night. So they timed what time it was, the first hour, or third hour, or so forth, by the stars. Notice, and here come this star passing right over every observatory, and not one of them noticed it. (Why, people go to the meetings and say, "I--I don't see nothing." You wasn't expecting anything, that's why. See?) Those people in the observatory, perhaps, up there on the tower of observation, they didn't expect to see anything. But there was somebody, was watching for that star of Jacob to rise. That's right.

L-30 He will be here one of these mornings, and just those who are waiting will be the one that will get it. That's right, just those who are watching. We used to sing an old song: "Be watching and waiting that sight to behold, He's coming again." That's right. So be waiting, watching. You don't know just what time He may appear. So, tonight be watching and expecting to rise off the cots, and stretchers, wheelchairs, wherever you are; be expecting to feel the unction of the Son of God when He moves into you to give you new faith and life to spring to your feet. "It's me. I'm waiting, Lord. The first time You touch my heart, out of this chair I'm coming. The first time You touch my body, out of here I'm coming." See? Be watching, expecting something to happen.

L-31 Now, the Angels came and sang to the shepherds. The shepherds went down into the city to find out this thing that had gone on. After eight days, it was a custom of the Jewish traditions to bring the child to the temple, all the male children. And they had to be circumcised, and had to offer either two turtle doves (that was a peasant's offering.) or a lamb (was a rich child's offering) for the purification of the mother and for the child. And so if--when you study the Old Testament, and see those laws of redeemed, the law of redemption, oh, it's a beautiful thing. I just love the Old Testament, because it's just a shadow of the New. If you get lined up with the Old Testament, you'll have a good conception of what the New means. Now... 'Cause it's a shadow of it. And just like Revelations 12 there, where the woman was seen with the moon under her feet, the law, and the sun on her head, the Gospel. See? Twelve stars, the twelve apostles and so forth...

L-32 Now notice, closely. They--they were expecting, these people were, to see God. They had an expectation in their heart to see those things happen, and God granted it to them. Now, you've got to desire it. David said in the Scripture, "When the deep calls to the deep... The noise of thy waterspout." Now, before there can be any--any deep to call in here, there has to be a deep out there first to make this deep in here call for it. See? The deep calling to the deep...

L-33 I love scenery. My, here some time ago I was hunting up in the mountains, not so much for the game, I was just up to get away. I just love the mountains. My mother's a half Indian, and it's just enough about it I love the wilds and I can't get out of it. And so, I can see a sunset and cry like a baby. I remember up there one day standing on the mountain, the elk herds was high that year, hadn't had no snow, and I was moving around up high near the timber line. And in the fall of the year, in October, there come storms. It'll maybe snow awhile, then it'll rain awhile, then the sun will come out.

L-34 I remember up there one fall, not long ago, I was tramping around, and there come up a storm. And I got in behind a tree and stood like this awhile, set my rifle down. The storm went over... There was an old blowdown there, anyhow. And after while, after the storm ceased, I listened. Standing there, I thought, "Well, which way shall I start from here now." Started... I backed down. I was about sixty or seventy miles, as far as I know, from a living human being, back with two or three pack horses and camped out. So I was setting there, standing there, rather, looking around and wondering which way to go from there, seeing no tracks or nothing. So I thought, "What will I do?" And about that time, way back over on another ridge the storm had got the elks scattered. And I heard the big males a bugling (Oh, my.), hear it echoing across the valley. Then the deep begin to call to the deep. Way back up here an old gray wolf got to howling, and his mate answering in the bottom. Mmmm. My, the deep was calling to the deep. I thought, "O God, surely You're the God of mountains too, way up here." If you got God in here, you can see God anywhere you look. That's right. It'll--it'll move out. 54-0220, Expectation, East Alton -Wood River Community High School, Wood River, IL, 89 min

L-35 Then I stood there a little while, and where the sun peaked out through the crevices of the rocks, as it was setting in the west, shining like the eye of God, looking, running to and fro through the earth, I noticed it shined against those trees. And where it took cold up that high, the ice had froze on the evergreens, making an icicle. And when it did, there come a rainbow across the valley. Now, this wolf hollering up here, and its mate in the bottom answering. My, and the elk herd, and the rainbow... I had my gun down against the tree. I run out there, and I raised up my hands, and I said, "O great Jehovah God, Who looks down from the heaven, the God... gave you this rain, and gave us this rainbow sign." I said, "I can see another rainbow sign in Revelations 2, where Jesus setting to look upon like jasper and sardine stone: Reuben and Benjamin, the first, the last, with a rainbow crossing the seven church ages, the colors; oh, the same yesterday, today and forever; Alpha, Omega; the beginning and the ending; He that was, which is and shall come; the Root and Offspring of David; the Morning Star." Setting behind me, seven colors, God's covenant with the Church, that He wrote with Jesus Christ, His Son, of a perfect redemption...

L-36 I begin to scream. Why, if they'd of got somebody to come up and look, they'd thought they had an insane person there. Around and around the tree I went as hard as I could go, jumping up in the air and screaming. I--I didn't--I didn't care who seen me. I was worshipping God. I... It don't make any difference to me what anybody thought. And now around and around again, and I thought, "Oh, my, Lord, why do I ever have to leave here? Isn't this beautiful up here?" But like, "Let's build three tabernacles," but there was somebody down at the bottom of the hill waiting to be prayed for, of course. So I thought I might as well just rejoice a little more. And around the tree I went again, shaking my arms and a screaming to the top of my voice, "Hallelujah. Hallelujah to God. Hallelujah to God." I thought, "Isn't this wonderful?" My, I was standing there, deep responding to the deep, call, waterspout, thy noise." I--I think, "Oh, my, isn't this beautiful?"

L-37 I happened to hear something jump out, went chirp, chirp, chirp, chirp, chirp, a little old pine squirrel. A little old fellow, just about that high, and he was the noisiest thing you ever heard. And he jumped up on a log out there, and well, I... The way he acted, I thought he was going to tear me to pieces, just about that big. You see? I looked at him; I thought, "Now, Lord, You never put nothing before a fellow lest there's--it's something for Your glory." And I said, "Now, why'd You let that little pine squirrel chirp like that." And I happened to notice the little fellow was looking down like that, and he wasn't looking at me. But the storm had forced a big eagle down in there. This eagle was coming up out of this undergrowth--this brush. And I looked; I said, "Oh, the eagle's what's excited you." And that little fellow was just acting like he was going to tear that eagle to pieces. So the big old eagle, he jumped up on a limb like that.

L-38 And I thought, "Now, why did God turn my attention from that rainbow, and that wolf calling, and so forth, to something like this?" I thought, "Well, Lord, You're in Your nature. So I was having such a wonderful time, why'd You do that?" I thought, "I'd study it just a minute." I thought, "Well now that eagle, he's a scavenger and nothing good about him." I thought, "Well, what's he doing?" I'd seen the big fellow looking at me. I thought, "Oh, I understand. He's so brave; he's not scared of me." I thought, "I'll try out his bravery." I said, "Hey, fellow, you know I could shoot you?" Them big gray eyes, walled, looked at me, looked over at this little squirrel. He wasn't scared. I thought, "Oh, Lord, I see. You want somebody's not scared." That's the trouble with the Church today; you're afraid. You're afraid when you ask, you won't receive. That's the reason you don't receive. Don't be scared. Ask, and then believe you're going to get it; you'll get it. God will give it to you.

L-39 So I thought, "Oh, I see, the bravery." I thought, "What makes him brave now? There's got to be some reason to make him brave. And I said... I grabbed my rifle like this; I said, "I'll scare him." And I grabbed my rife like I was going to pull it up like this, and he flipped them big wings and looked back at me again, looked back. I thought, "Well, why is he so brave?" I noticed him; he kept feeling his wings, shuffling his feathers out. I thought, "Oh, I see. God gave you two wings; that's God's given power, and you trust it." And I thought, "If--if God gave the eagle two wings to take hisself out of danger, and he has that much trust in his 54-0220, Expectation, East Alton -Wood River Community High School, Wood River, IL, 89 min wings, what ought a church that's baptized with the Holy Ghost do?" See? There he was, moving his feathers. I thought, "Yeah, as long as he can feel them wings, they're all right, he ain't scared of nothing." And I said, "Praise God." As long as I can feel the Holy Spirit moving, devils can't scare nothing (That's right.), when the Holy Spirit's around. How marvelous, no wonder you can stand, not like the Rock of Gibraltar but the Rock of Ages. We'll stand after the Rock of Gibraltar's gone.

L-40 So I thought, "Isn't that marvelous?" Well, then I said... wonder why he... Now, I said, "Now, that timber's not very high and he knows that it's his get a way." Before I could get that rifle to my shoulder, and especially through the little old V sights, he'd be in that timber, and I couldn't shoot him, and he knows that. "Well," I thought, "isn't this wonderful?" And I started shouting again. I don't know if I scared him then or not. But anyhow, he looked around a little while. I thought, "I admire you, fellow. I wouldn't shoot you. If you're that brave, I--I love bravery, and I sure wouldn't shoot you." And he set there a little while. After while, he just give hisself a little pitch like that, with his feet. And he got tired of hearing that there little old pine squirrel, "Chatter, chatter, chatter, chatter, chatter, chatter." And I thought, "That's right. Just puts you in mind of some of these people around here, 'Days of miracles is past. There's no such thing as Divine healing. Holy Ghost ain't for this day.'" Just jump all away from it. That's right. Just get on away from it; go on away. And I noticed him. Now, he just didn't flop, flop, flop, flop, flop with his wings. He just made a big jump, and made about two flops, then he set his wings. And as that air...?... he never moved a feather. He just knowed how to ride that air, he just went on, on, on, out of sight.

L-41 I stood there. I cried like a baby. I said, "That's it, Lord. It ain't run here and run there, and flop here and flop there. It's just set your wings of faith in the power of God, and when it rolls in, ride up. Ride away from the... saying, 'The days of miracles is past, there is no such a thing.'" Ride out. Don't keep trying to pushing and shoving, just set your faith in Gods power. When the waves come in, ride up on it like that." That's it. Amen. Then the deep really called to the deep then. Marvelous. Deep calling to the deep. Unless there is a deep... Before there is a fin on a fish's back, there had to be a water first for him to swim in, before he ever had the fin, or you wouldn't have no fin. Is that right? Before there could be a tree to grow in the earth, there had to be an earth first for it to grow in, or there'd be no tree. Is that right? In other words...

L-42 Here, I read sometime ago where a little boy eat the eraser off of a pencil, and he'd eat the--and eat the pedal off of a bicycle, a rubber pedal. And they couldn't understand why the little fellow was eating rubber all the time. So they took him down to the clinic and examined him, and the doctor said, "Why, his little body's craving sulfur." There you are. See? Now, the little boy was taken out of the earth, where sulfur is, and as long as there was a crave for sulfur in here, there had to be a sulfur to respond to that crave. See? Now, how many in here believes in Divine healing? Let's see your hand. The power of God? Thank you. Look. Before there can be a creation, there has to be a Creator to create that creation. Is that right? Well, as long as you're hungering for Divine healing and the power of God, there's got to be a Fountain open somewhere. Is that right? If there isn't Divine healing, you wouldn't have that in your heart. The Creator God has to create that in your heart before you can even think of such a thing. Hallelujah. Then you want more of God; you hunger for more of God. And because that you do hunger is a very fine evidence that there is more of God to receive. And if you crave Divine healing, that shows that there is a Fountain of Divine healing somewhere or that creation wouldn't be in your heart. You get what I mean?

L-43 Quickly now, just a couple more minutes. Oh, my, I just love Him; that's all. I just can't help it. See, I've got... Think of it. Any route you take, anywhere you want to start from, you'll see Jesus Christ in His power. That's right. Any road you want to make: two natures, two atmospheres, two signs, two anything you want to, there's Jesus Christ right in the middle of it. Amen. Yes.

L-44 Now, look at this. I see Simeon, an old man, an old sage (as they called them), long white hair, about eighty years old, we're taught, and long beard. He had a reputation. He was a master in Israel. And he worked around the temple there, and so forth, well-thought-of. But one day the old fellow, perhaps, was out praying somewhere, and the Holy Spirit come to him and said, "Simeon, you're not going to die. You're an old man, but you're not going to die until you 54-0220, Expectation, East Alton -Wood River Community High School, Wood River, IL, 89 min see the Christ of God." And he went around testifying, telling the people. Now, he wasn't afraid it hurt his reputation. I can imagine a fellow saying, "Look at that old guy. Why, he's--he's a little bit off at his head." See? "Because look he's--he's nearly dead right now. And yet, David looked for Christ, and all back the prophets looked for Christ, and it's farther away than it ever was. Here we are in all this conglomeration and what we are now, and yet, that old fellow says he ain't going to die till he sees Christ. There's something wrong with the old fellow. He studied too hard." No, but the Holy Spirit revealed it to him. That's a good reason to testify of It, is that right? The Holy Spirit said so.

L-45 Now, then the first thing you know, when Jesus was born... Simeon knowed nothing about it. Well, let's do just a little drama here to the end, if you will. I imagine it's Monday morning in the temple. And oh, my, the people are coming, there's about two million Jews then or more. I suppose, maybe, fifty or a hundred babies was born, there may be more than that, every night. Well then, every morning there'd be a great long line of mothers standing there with their babies, and some of them poor with old turtle doves, and some with little sheeps, for the purification and the circumcision of the child, and whatmore, and coming up the road to the priest to minister the--the order. Then, let's say it's Monday morning now. And oh, there's been a great conglomeration around the city and everything, and everybody's busy and their... all temples are full. And Simeon had a little time over in the prayer room to pray awhile. Went over there... I just to imagine he was reading Isaiah about the 40th chapter, saying, "All we like sheep have gone astray (or something). The Lord has laid upon Him the iniquity of us all. Oh, He was wounded for our transgressions, bruised for our iniquities; the chastisement of our peace upon Him, with His stripes we were healed." I can hear Simeon say, "Now, I wonder who that could be other wise than Messiah." And the same time the Messiah was in the temple in the arms of his mother.

L-46 Let's look coming up along the line now. I see these fine ladies there with nice little needle work blankets, little pink and blue over their little babies, and they're cooing them on the chin, and so forth. And oh, how they was walking along. And there was a girl there that had a bad name: she had a baby without being married (Hmmmm.), belonged to--down there in Nazareth somewhere. My, there she is the temple. There's that baby that was borned out of holy wedlock. Mary knew Who that baby belonged to. She walked right along with this baby. "Keep your distance from her. Don't stand around such a person." It reminds me of some of these half-sister churches today. We know where we're standing. I know what this Holy Ghost means to me; it's Life. I don't care what the others think about it. It's Life. Might make me act peculiar, that's to the world.

L-47 But notice, they kept their distance. "Keep away from her." They shunning around. And every time... She held the little baby in her hands. The rest of them with fine little blankets on, but He was wrapped in swaddling's clothes. Now, I'm taught that swaddling clothes is what goes on the back of a yolk of an ox, when they plow with it. The baby was born in a manger, so they just unwrapped the... had no old clothes to put on the little Fellow. You talk about poor. And no... And yet, the King of glory... And they unwrapped the swaddling's cloth and wrapped it around the little Fellow. And here He was, the little Fellow, laying in His mothers arms, a little girl about eighteen years old, twenty, coming up, holding this little Baby, cooing and looking down in His face. She didn't care. It didn't blush her when they called her a fanatic, or so forth, or this, that, if she was in disgrace. Didn't pay any attention to her; she just moved on. She knowed where she was at. She knowed what it was all about. Make any difference what the outside world says. You remember the same thing by your testimony, if you're borned again. Let them call you a fanatic. That's all right. You know where you're at. The world knows their own. God knows His too.

L-48 So here she comes along with this baby, walking along. I can see people come by, saying, "Wonder why they're staying away from that little old girl. Oh, my. Look at her with that swaddling's cloth. My, that must be a poor kid. Well, we're refined. So We go to better church; and we don't have to fool with nothing like that." Here sat an old man back there. Oh, he had a little spot of peace in him, back here. I can hear him sitting there reading 54-0220, Expectation, East Alton -Wood River Community High School, Wood River, IL, 89 min the Scriptures. All at once the Holy Ghost... Now, look. If God gave Simeon--the Holy Ghost give Simeon this promise that he wasn't going to die till he seen the Christ of God, the Holy Ghost is under obligation to see that he sees the Christ then. That's right. He made him the promise; He's obligated. (I hope you're getting between the lines here...?...) The Holy Spirit's obligated to the Word. God's obligated to His Word. He certainly is. I'm obligated to my word, and you're obligated to your word. And if your word's no good, then you're no good. If God's Word's no good, then I--I can't--I can't worship God. Because there... I wouldn't believe there was any, if He wouldn't back up His Word. That's true.

L-49 So then, I see her moving along. Here's Simeon; he's setting there reading. And all at once, the Christ in the temple. The Holy Ghost had give him the promise. The Holy Ghost knowed all about that. So you see, Simeon sitting there reading. So He said, "Simeon, stand up on your feet." Simeon said, "Yes, Lord." He laid it down. "That was the Voice of the Holy Ghost," I can hear Simeon say. "Stand up. Start walking." "Where, Lord?" "Just walk. I'll take care of the rest of it."

L-50 "How am I going to walk after I get out of this stretcher?" I don't know. He will take care of the rest of it. See? Just start walking (See?), when He tells you. "How am I going to get up out of the wheelchair?" I don't know, but you just keep walking. He--He will take care of the rest of it. "How am I going to get over the cancer, heart trouble." I--I don't know. Just take His Word and keep walking. He will take care of the rest of it. See here. He's obligated to His Word. That's right. "How am I going to tell my mother, if I get the Holy Ghost, and my daddy? They belong to a different church." Just get it. He will take care of the rest of it. You see? You don't have to worry about that. He will take care it. "How will I face my school, my playmates?" Don't worry. Just keep going. He will take care of that. See?

L-51 Simeon raises up. Here he starts, not knowing where he's going, just walking. But the Holy Ghost is directing his steps. Don't you believe men are led by the Spirit of God? They that are sons of God are. Is that right? Here he comes, not knowing where he's going. But he's led by the Spirit of God. He moves over to this line of circumcision coming down, his mother. Here he starts walking down, not knowing where he's going. The Holy Ghost is leading him. And the Holy Ghost brought him right straight before this little despised mother, standing there with this baby with swaddling cloth. I can hear the Holy Ghost say, "This is it." He reached over and got the Baby in his arms, took it out of Mary's arms, tears rolling down his white beard, said, "Lord, let Thy servant depart in peace, according to Thy Word, for my eyes have seen Thy Salvation." That's right. The world spurned It, and that man loved It. The same thing today, the world spurns the baptism of the Spirit and the works of the Holy Ghost, but there's hungry hearts that's coming to It, moving to It.

L-52 Now, look. The same Holy Spirit... There's no two Holy Spirits, there's only one. And the same Holy Spirit that give Simeon that promise, is the same Holy Spirit that drawed you out here tonight. Is that right? He made you come, sister, and to you, sister, and you, you, you, you, every one of you. He brought you here. The devil would never bring you around a place like this. I'll guarantee you that. The Holy Ghost brought you here. If you believe in Divine Healing, then the Holy Spirit brought you where the Fountain's open, just like He did Simeon. You embraced God's promise like Simeon did. And at the same time, in the temple, was an old woman by the name of Ann. And she was blind, we're taught. And she was waiting for the consolation of Israel. At the same time, the Holy Spirit struck her. Here come an old blind prophetess, walking among the people, not knowing where she was going. Maybe blind here, but she was led by the Holy Spirit. Moved up to the side of Child and lifted up her hands and blessed God. And all those that waited the consolation of Israel...

L-53 If the Holy Spirit could lead that blind woman to the promise of God, how much more would He lead you and I to 54-0220, Expectation, East Alton -Wood River Community High School, Wood River, IL, 89 min His promise. She was expecting and waiting for the consolation of Israel; that was the Christ. She was expecting to see Him. Simeon was expecting to see Him. And I'm expecting to see Him tonight. I'm expecting to see Him. I'm expecting to watch His power. I'm expecting to see something done, because He promised me that He would do it. That's right. Whatever you expect, that's what you will receive. Shall we pray?

L-54 Heavenly Father, in the Name of Jesus Thy beloved Child, as Simeon of old embraced Him in his arms, may we with the strong arms of faith tonight reach out and embrace Him, bring Him nigh unto us who are needy. May He come to Your people tonight. Save the lost, bring back the wondering sheep that's gone astray, straying around over the country, no church home, no place to go, like wondering stars know that they ought to be at their Father's house feasting and dining on the good things of God. Bring them back tonight, Lord. That poor sinner who's never eat at the table of God, the good things of the Spirit, may he realize tonight, and leave that garbage can from whence he has eaten and turn to the table set with blessed holy hands. Grant it, Lord. May the poor sick, and crippled, and afflicted people, by arms of faith reach out tonight, and embrace Jesus Christ as their Healer. And now, Father, when He was here on earth, You sent Him. You told Him that He was do Your will; "I come in the volume of the Book to do Thy will, O God." And now He returned back to You after making the sacrifice that--of His Ownself, that He could bring many sons unto God. And now, tonight, Lord, I, as Your servant, along with these other servants, are here to do Thy will, O God; as it is written, by Him which said, "The things that I do shall you also." Grant it tonight. And may that same power that led Simeon, and Ann, John the Baptist, many of the others, and all the other righteous, may He come and lead us into deeper depths and high heights with Thy love and power, for we ask it in His Name. Amen.

L-55 Sorry to take so much of your time, but I just feel... Oh, what a fine audience of faith. Now, if you were--come tonight and you wanted to see Jesus... If you wanted to see Jesus, what type of Person would you look for? A real fine scholar? No. Ask somebody who knows what the original writing of the Bible was in--just plain, not even good grammar, just like you use out on the streets, common people. See? That's the type of Person you'd find. Where would you find Him at? The great high classes? Oh, no. Down on the river, among the poor, the outcast, whoever would receive Him. Those classic spirits, religious as they can be, great fine synagogues... Remember, scholars... Well, who could beat them priests for holiness? If they did one thing wrong, they was stoned. They had to be holy, without blemish. That right? Scholars of the Word, but yet, failed to see God. That's the way it is today.

L-56 Now, as God took--takes His man but never His Spirit. The same Spirit was upon Elijah come on Elisha, then on John the Baptist, and predicted again in the last day. Is that right? God taken His man, but... He took His Son but the Spirit come back. See? The devil takes his man but never the spirit. It comes right back, very religious. Didn't Paul say in the last days they'd be heady, high-minded, lovers of pleasure more than lovers of God, having a form of godliness and denying the power thereof; from such turn away? Now, we're all here. That's right. God's people is here, Satan's here. The antichrist is not a communist. Communist is not the antichrist spirit. The Bible said in Saint Matthew the 24th chapter, that the antichrist would be so close to the real thing, that it would deceive the very elect, if possible. That's right. It's religious. It's all in Revelations 17: sitting upon a scarlet covered beast, and how that she had daughters that went out from her. And you're not blind. See? All right. Someday I hope just to cross the country teaching the Gospel, just as the best that I know how. But now it's prayer for the sick.

L-57 When we see Jesus standing there, what kind of Man was He then? He was a Man of sorrow, acquainted with grief. Yet, He had a personality... He could tell them when it was necessary to be told. He got some sticks one day, or some ropes and beat the whole bunch of them out of the temple. So if it come necessary, He could do it. Then if He look at you and your heart would melt. See? 54-0220, Expectation, East Alton -Wood River Community High School, Wood River, IL, 89 min And now, how did people receive it? Those who approached Him (now watch), those who approached Him as a loving, kind Saviour, they felt virtue. They were told of what was wrong with them, and what for them to do.

L-58 But they wrapped a rag around His face one day, and hit Him on the head with a stick and said, "Now, You're a seer, you--you're a prophesier. You know what the people's doing and everything. You tell them out there what they're thinking about and what they're doing." Now, they hit Him on the head, and said, "Now, tell us who hit You?" He never opened His mouth, said a word. See? You've heard these people say, "Let me see this Divine healer go heal this person, we'll believe it." Just remember, that fellow's possessed of the devil. See? The very first thing that--that Satan did when he met Eve, was that thing. The first thing he did when he met Jesus, he said, "If you're the Son of God... Now, you have power. If you're the Son of God, perform me a miracle here that I can see you do it. Make--make this bread in--in... this stones into bread. Let me see you do it now, and I'll believe you." See?

L-59 Took Him up on the pinnacle of the temple, said, "Now, dash your foot down, just... or jump off of here, right there. It's written in the Scriptures. I'll give you Scripture for it." Jesus said, "Thou shalt not tempt the Lord thy God. Get away from me, Satan." Is that right? He never clowned for Satan. He only did the Father's will. Now, look. He didn't claim to be a healer, did He? He said, "I can do nothing in Myself." When He passed all them crippled people and so forth, never healed a one of them, He healed a man had a disease, something like prostate or something like that; he'd had it for a long time. He said, "Will thou be made whole?" Never healed any of the crippled. And the Jews questioned Him. He said, "Verily, verily, I say unto you. The Son can do nothing in Himself, but what He sees the Father doing." Is that right? "The Father shows Me what to do and I go do it." Now, if He's the same yesterday, today, and forever, died, rose from the dead, He said, "The things that I do, shall you do also." Is that right? That's a promise.

L-60 Of course, you know I'm doing something. Certainly. I'm bringing myself down from the anointing of preaching down into this (See?), for the healing (See?), getting back to... settle the audience. Be reverent. Now, He didn't claim to be a healer, but He saw visions of what the... Jesus said, "I do nothing." That means He didn't do one thing without God first showing Him. Now, if you want to read that, you turn to Saint John 5:19 and see if that's right. See? "Verily, verily, I say unto you, the Son can do nothing in Himself, but what He sees the Father doing. (See?) That doeth the Son likewise." He never taken credit; He give it to God. See? No human flesh can glory in the sight of God. So He said that He done what the Father showed Him. He knowed where a fish was, had a coin in his mouth. Paul standing, preaching one time, and seen a man that was crippled, or something wrong with him, laying in a stretcher, or cot, or something or other, said, "I perceive that you have faith to be healed. Stand up on your feet. Jesus Christ makes you whole." And he jumped up. That's the Gospel.

L-61 Now, if Jesus will return here tonight and do the things that He did when He was here on earth, do the same manifestations... He called the woman at the well and said, "Bring Me a drink." She said, "The pump... The well's deep here." He talked to her a little bit and He said--went right straight to her trouble, said, "Go, get your husband." She said, "I don't have any husband." Said, "That's right. You've got five." Why, she run into the city and said, "Come, see a Man Who told me everything I ever done." Why, He didn't do that. He only told her one thing. But if God can show Him one thing, He could show Him all things. So she said, "Isn't this the Christ?"

L-62 Philip come to Him, got saved, went out and found Nathanael. Said to Nathanael, "Come, see Who I found, Jesus of Nazareth, the Son of Joseph." He said, "Could anything good come out of Nazareth?" Said, "You come, see." 54-0220, Expectation, East Alton -Wood River Community High School, Wood River, IL, 89 min So when He standing in the prayer line praying for the sick perhaps... What He done sixty percent of His time, or better, was praying for the sick, yeah, about eighty percent, praying for the sick. And perhaps Philip come up to Him in the line, or Nathanael. Jesus looked and him and said, "Behold an Israelite in whom there is no guile." "Why," he said, "when did You... How do You know?" In otherwise, "there's a Christian man that's honest." Said, "How did You know I was a Christian man and honest?" He said, "Before Philip called you, when you was under the tree, that's when I saw you." Philip said... or Nathanael said, "Thou art the Christ, the Son of God, the King of Israel." You know what the 1944 version of that would mean? Mental telepathy, a devil, fortuneteller, something like that. See? "Blind lead the blind and they all fall in the ditch." That's right. Let us not be like them tonight. Let us be open hearted and receive our lovely Lord Jesus into our hearts.

L-63 [Blank.spot.on.tape--Ed.]... 'course I wouldn't know if you just went through what we used to have, the old fast line, you know, where people would just go through so fast, and just running as hard as they could. And I'm glad that you mentioned that, something, so I can get a starting place to get to talk to you. Now, as far as in life, we're both strangers to each other, never knew you, one another. And... But God knows both of us, doesn't He? Now, what if our Lord Jesus Christ, our Saviour, was standing here tonight, wearing this suit that He gave me, and He was standing here, looking to you... Now, He'd know what your--what your trouble was. Is that right? But now about healing, what do you think He could say? Why, He'd say, "Child, don't you believe that I healed you when I died for you nineteen hundred years ago? Could you accept that?" You'd say, "Yes, I can, Lord." Well, if you could accept it, then just as you believe, so would it be. Is that right?

L-64 But now, being the King of prophets, God, Emmanuel, He would know what--what was wrong with you, and what was your trouble, and so forth. Is that right? But otherwise, He--He could do nothing for you. Is that right? Well then, if He's risen from the dead and could... If He could come into my body and take my voice, could He say the same thing that He would say if He was standing here in flesh...?... Did He promise to do it? He did. That's right. Makes Him the same yesterday, today, and forever. And then we, the believers, could see Him. He'd be with us, in us, to the end of the world. That's through every age, on down to the end of the world. Is that right? That makes Him the same yesterday, today, and forever. Is that true? Now, you're conscious that something's going on, aren't you? It's--it's... See, now right between you and I now stands that Light.

L-65 Now, to heal you, I couldn't. To hide your life, you couldn't. See? Because it's all in the hands of God now. See? That's right. Oh, child. Much sorrow, and in much danger... One thing you're extremely nervous. You got enough to be nervous about. It's just turning black all around where you're at. Oh, it's... You--you got... It's heart trouble. And that's... Why, you've been give up by the doctor to die. That's been about a month ago or more. And he said that there was--you had two holes, or leaks, or something like that. Some funny name he called it. I heard him just then when he said it. But it was some funny name, it about... But what it is, it amounts up to, is two holes in your heart; I see as the blood's dripping through. Are those things the truth? Is the same Jesus Who knew Philip was under the tree, could see you in the... under the condition of what it... Is that right? Is He standing here? Is He your Saviour? Is He your Healer? Come here.

L-66 Now, I realize I'm just a man, sister. But now, while That is on here... I'm you're brother and God's servant. See? Now, the power of healing, true, is here. See? But I can only do with it, if He will let me. I'm going to pronounce the blessing that you live and not die. And I'm... Will you give God praise? Our Lord Jesus, I lay my hand upon this woman, and I ask for her life to be spared. And for this which the doctors could not do, may the power of Almighty God do in Jesus' Christ Name. Amen. I bless thee, my sister, for your healing in the Name of Jesus, the Son of God. Amen. Now, you write me your testimony. God bless you. 54-0220, Expectation, East Alton -Wood River Community High School, Wood River, IL, 89 min

L-67 The Lord be blessed. Now, before the anointing gets me till where I don't know where I'm at, how many believes that Jesus Christ is here now? That's--that's the same Jesus. Now, that's His power. That's His wonder that He said He would do. Now, be reverent, everywhere. Be expecting God to do for you what He did for her. Just believe it is all you have to do. Now, keep praying out there. Just believe it and see if the Holy Spirit can't come out through the audience there and heal you where you're at, up in the bleachers, or wherever you are. Just believe is all I ask you to do.

L-68 Come, lady. How do you do? 'Course you're conscious that Something's near. But we are strangers to one another. I don't know you, never seen you in my life, as I know of. I suppose you never knew me before. No. We're perfect... Then we've never seen each other before, the first time in life to ever come face to face with one another. But Lord knows you, and He knows me. You are a Christian believer, 'cause your spirit just feels so welcome. And I know that this is the Holy Spirit here. And I know It welcomes you. Now, if Jesus our Saviour, being the Saviour of both of us, and God the Father of both of us, then we become God's children. Then we're here to help one another. And if God has sent me to help you, then I must do what God tells me to do. Then I'm asking you to believe on Him, and to believe that He sent me to--to--with a Divine gift, just to make faith for you.

L-69 Now, if we've never seen each other before, why, there'd have to be some way that... If He would tell me anything about you. If I, probably when It strikes, would keep talking to you, It would just keep on talking. But it's just something... For instance, if you're sick, or if there's something wrong with you otherwise, if you've done something wrong, if He'd just speak that out and tell you about it, you'd be willing to accept it, wouldn't you? I--I can tell you, before anything happens that you really are a believer. Your trouble, you're real nervous. And that's due to the time of life that you're living in, coming to the menopause. That's a lady's age. But... Excuse me. Something happened. You--you--you've had an accident. I seen a stick or something hit you in the head, wasn't it? Is that right? And it's caused you to have hemorrhages in--inside the head. Is that true? Come here. Oh, Jesus, Son of God, I bless this, my sister, for her healing. And now, enemy, leave her. I rebuke this tumor. In the Name of Jesus Christ may it go out from her and she be made well for Thy glory. I bless thee, my sister, for the healing of your body. God bless you now. Go, rejoicing.

L-70 Have faith. Don't doubt. Just keep faith; keep believing. Let's be reverent and just believe with all of our heart now. Now, be just as reverent now. How do you do, lady? I say, how do you do? We are strangers, I suppose, to each other. [The lady speaks to Brother Branham--Ed.] Yes, ma'am. You was in my service where? [The lady says, "At Evansville."--Ed.] Excuse me. I'm not hard of hearing, but it's just... You can understand. About five or six years ago. Oh, yes. You come from, I believe, from St. Louis, over there one night. Yes. [The lady says, "Brother Van Huesen."--Ed.] Yes, Von--Von Huesen, that's it. That was Brother Von Huesen. They had the same place, I believe, I was in the other day, over there, here a few weeks ago or... [The lady speaks again--Ed.] I see.

L-71 Well, then you and I are strangers to each other, not knowing one another. But do you believe that Jesus Christ has risen from the dead? And do you believe that He can, by sovereign grace and election, that He sends people here on earth, and sets them aside to preach the Gospel, and to do different works for Him? You believe that, don't you? Then if we've never met in life, and if God would say something that was wrong with you, and you know I have no way of knowing it, well, it'd have to come from some supernatural resource. Is that right? Well then, would you accept that as God? See? You'd have to. Thank you. See, it's just... I'm trying to feel the approach. You see what I mean. 'Cause it--it's the way you regard It. Not me, but you have to respect what I'm talking about or it just--just won't be. See? It's your approach to God. That people that... Woman touched His garment one time and she got healed. But another one hit Him on the head and everything else; they couldn't feel no virtue. It's the way they approached Him.

L-72 Yes. Now, the lady is just breaking up in front of me. But she's... something... I see she has a... It's gallbladder 54-0220, Expectation, East Alton -Wood River Community High School, Wood River, IL, 89 min trouble. It's in her--it's in her right side. And she has... There's something wrong with the throat. Is that right? And then, also, I see when you're standing with clothes... You got a growth, and that growth is on the right shoulder. Is that right? Is that... Was that true? Now, what spoke to you wasn't me. It was my--my voice, but I wasn't operating it. 'Cause I wouldn't know what to say. No. But it was some other voice... it's my voice but Something speaking my voice. Is that right? Do you believe it was God? Then come here. Kind heavenly Father, in the Name of Jesus Thy beloved Child, I ask for the healing of my sister. And I bless her now, and condemn the enemy, and make her well in the Name of Jesus the Son of God. Amen. I bless thee, my sister, in Jesus Name for your healing. Amen. God bless you, my sister. Go, being happy, rejoicing. Don't doubt. The Bible said, "Go ye and sin no more (that's unbelief), or worse will come upon you."

L-73 Now, be real reverent. Just keep praying, lady. Yet It stood over you twice tonight. See? Now, have faith. I know your trouble, but I can't say just what. It was over the other lady too, but I--I want to see you healed. See? Then I can tell you it's THUS SAITH THE LORD. Now, be reverent everywhere, please. See, each person's a spirit. As you move, it... I... Just believe me. Just be quiet, you know, just be just as reverent as you can be. All right. Let the patient come.

L-74 Faith is moving everywhere. Now, be real reverent. All right. How do you do, sir? You are a believer. You're already anointed. But we're strangers to each other, personally as strangers, yes, sir. I don't know nothing about you. As far as I know, I've never seen you in my life. But only God knows you. I don't. Does anybody here know the man? Anybody in the building know the man, know him? All right. Then if we be strangers to each other, my brother, and we know not each other, and God knows us both, may He help us. May He help me as His servant to help you, his servant. 'Cause we're both want to live; we want to serve God. We want to do all we can for the Kingdom of God. Yes, sir. Now, the man leaves me. You've been healed, and that was... But you wasn't at a platform. You were sitting in an audience. And your wife was being healed at the platform. And it was somewhere... It was Brother Bosworth standing to my right hand side, smiling. It's... There's Brother Vibbert. It--it was at Evansville, Indiana. Was that true? It's moving again. Just a moment now. You, oh, you... It was ulcers you had. And you're standing now for an elderly man; that's your father, and he isn't here, and he's got kidney trouble. Go home, lay your hands on him and...?... in the Name of Jesus Christ the Son of God.

L-75 How do you do? Now, everybody just reverent. I'm not beside myself. I just have to get my bearings. You see? Visions are something... You're in another world. And now, I can't hardly see out over the audience, and I've got good sight. But just look like... I know I can hear people. I can hear people. And it just seems like it's like a yellow haze hanging here. You'll never know till we meet at the judgment.

L-76 This is the patient, isn't it? This is the patient? Come here. I suppose we're strangers, lady; we don't know each other, perfect strangers. But God alone knows. And I--I know that God can reveal and can make me know what your trouble... I can't heal you, only just by obeying him, laying hands... Jesus said, "In my Name they shall cast out; if they lay their hands on the sick..." Is that right? I see a long, white table. There's somebody... There's doctors; there's something about the back, it's a--it's a your... oh, it's kidney stones in the back, and they're want to operate immediately. Is that right? Well, Christ can operate right now. If you will believe, and He will take it from you now. Come here just a moment. Kind heavenly Father...?... Son of God [Congregation prays aloud--Ed.]... the woman be healed. May these stones leave her and she can go home and be well, whom I bless her, and may...?... in Jesus' Name. Amen. Praise be to the Living God. Have faith. Don't doubt.

L-77 Come, lady. You want to get over that sinus, lady, setting back there? You believe that Christ can made you well? With all your heart? If you want to accept your healing, stand up on your feet. Say, "I accept it." God bless you. Go and be made well. 54-0220, Expectation, East Alton -Wood River Community High School, Wood River, IL, 89 min There He is. Praise be to the living God. You want to get over that prostate trouble, setting down on the end of the row, sir? You believe that Jesus Christ will make you well? Can you hear me? You was standing there praying, wasn't you? Stand up on your feet. Jesus Christ heals you of the prostate trouble. Go home and be well. There was two men standing there, one with a gray suit on, one brown. A man setting in here, somewhere like that with same thing, you're healed. Go home. Christ makes you well.

L-78 You believe, sister? With all your heart? You believe me to be His servant? I'm... It's not for me to do anything, sister. He told me if you get the people to believe you. I said "They won't believe me." He said, "Take hold of their hand and tell them what is wrong. Said... I said, "Well then, they..." He said, "There'll be two signs given you, like was given to Moses to perform a miracle, two miracles." And He said, "By this they'll believe." And I said... He said, "You'll know what's wrong with them. You'll know the very secrets of their heart." I said, "How will this come?" Said, "Knoweth thou not the Scripture? Didn't Jesus of Nazareth promise this?" You believe that? That's the reason I asked if you believe me. Not believe me as Him, but believe that He sent me to help you. You do? Then go eat your supper. Your stomach trouble left you.

L-79 You believe with all your heart? Have faith in God. You want to get over diabetes and be made well? You do? You accept your healing? Go home in Jesus Christ's Name and be made well. How do you do, sister? You believe God healed you of that female trouble? You do? All right. God bless you. Go and believe.

L-80 All right. Come, lady. Be reverent. Our Lord is here. Now, two demons are screaming to one another (Be reverent.), coming from this direction. Something wrong with your back, isn't there? Is that right? You have too, didn't you? Stand up on your feet, ladies. You're both healed now; you can go home and be well. Jesus Christ makes you both well. Say, "Thanks be to God." All right. You want to get over the heart trouble? You accept your healing from Jesus Christ? God bless you, my sister, and may you be healed in Jesus Christ's Name. Amen. God bless you.

L-81 Come on, lady. Do you believe with all your heart? Are you a believer? You believe me His Prophet, His servant? Got the wickedest thing there is to fight. About eighty percent of this audience is suffering with the same thing. It's just coming from all out there. Let me show you. Turn your face this a way. How many out there is suffering with nervousness? Raise your hand. See? You have real funny feelings, fearing, weary, upset, think you're going to lose your mind. Satan told you you was, but he lied. You're healed now. Go home and be made well in the Name of Jesus. ...?... her blessed you, you go home now, and do whatever you want to. God bless you. Healed, go home shouting praising God.

L-82 Come, lady. Do you believe? I want to talk to you just a minute. [Brother Branham talks to the lady--Ed.] Is that the truth? I just... Now, the audience... Nothing wrong with the lady, in the way of immorals and things, she's a nice lady. But it's just something I couldn't say before an audience. And only God alone knows the woman. Is that right, lady? Is that the truth? Just God alone was in there with you (Is that right?), when it happened. Is that right? Now, you're going to get well. God bless you. Let me just lay hands on you, just a minute. In Jesus Christ's Name I rebuke the evil one; leave her. Amen. God bless you. Had a funny feeling awhile ago when I talked about that lady here with that back trouble, didn't you, sir? Uh-huh. Set with your shirt open there, setting there. Is that right? Setting out here, set... Yeah. You were healed too of the same thing. You had back trouble. You were healed. I couldn't tell you 'cause I couldn't get to you just then. What do you think, setting there, lady, praying? Want to get rid of that arthritis? Setting right down below in here, you want to get rid of that arthritis? You do? Yes. Uh-huh... If it isn't...?... 54-0220, Expectation, East Alton -Wood River Community High School, Wood River, IL, 89 min Courtesy of Living Word Broadcast P. O.
