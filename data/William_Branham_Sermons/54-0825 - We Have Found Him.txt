--- TRANSCRIPT ---

L-1 Thank you, friends, and maybe we'll just stand just for a moment. Our kind heavenly Father, we thank Thee tonight, for the privilege that we have of coming before Thy beloved children to pray one for the other, as Thou has commissioned us to do so. We thank Thee for these people that's here tonight. And may Thy blessings rest upon each one. And now, in spite of the heat and the great wave that we're having through the city, we are thankful that the people are coming out to hear this glorious old Gospel. Never gets old, it will remain in the ages that is to come. We expect to hear It in glory, how Jesus died for the sinner, and healed the sick at His death, resurrected for our justification, and has ascended up on high, and sent gifts back to man to manifest His love to the world.

L-2 We thank Thee for these Gospel truths. We thank Thee for men in the world today with fearless hearts who goes and proclaim the full Gospel of the Lord Jesus Christ, suffering persecution, criticism, or whatever it may be; nothing stops them. Their vision goes on, for it comes from Calvary. And we thank Thee for this. And now, hide us tonight, Father. We pray that You'll... If there's any lost, save them; any a little indifferent, bring them back to a full knowledge. And if there's any sick, Lord, heal every one. Get glory out of the service as we commit ourselves to Thee. In Jesus' Name we ask it. Amen. You can be seated.

L-3 God be merciful to the needy tonight. I have told Brother Baxter, our--my manager, that in... time the heat is so great, and after he's already spoken once, there's no need of me speaking any more, start the prayer line, start praying for the sick. I do appreciate you people coming out in these hot rooms. Just a bit nervous tonight. I've tried to swing my meetings one way or the other so I could get more through the line and things, and you get used to this way in a regular routine, a different spirit and so forth, and it makes you a little upset when you try to change your program. So I'm going to start the prayer line just in a few moments.

L-4 And whatever Brother Baxter's told you tonight, I don't knows. I never know what the brother speaks on, or what takes place. My boy comes over here around about six o'clock, and seven, or whatever it is, and gives out prayer cards. He's in one room and I'm in another place where we stay. Then some man come last night and got me from somewhere. And tonight another man come and got me. They bring me over here; I enter into the door about five minutes before. Then they notify Mr. Baxter that I'm here. They sing "Only Believe," and--and I come up in the room, just come, start praying for the sick. Now, it's to my interest that Jesus Christ is glorified. And that's what I'm here for tonight, is to try in my humble way... I only wish I could preach like some of these ministers, like Brother Baxter, Oral Roberts, Billy Graham, some of those outstand--Jack Shuler, some of those man like that who are really ministers who preach the Gospel.

L-5 How easy it would be for me to go and preach the Gospel sermon, go home, go to bed and forget it. That isn't it. I got a challenge of every demon that's present, to stand before. I got critics that's setting waiting to say one word they know I'd say wrong, they'd lang right on that--hang right on to it. And there it would go. Have to be careful. Therefore coming under the anointing a few hours before service I pray, ask God to help me. I stay in the room till I feel His Presence. Coming over, no one speaks a word to me. Never a word spoke, unless it's, "Good evening," or something, till we enter the building, then next call is up here, 'cause I don't like to talk to people. If you do, if visions are starting and starts talking to the people... Then I--I... It just weakens me down.

L-6 Every vision brings me weaker and weaker all the time. That way, friends, it's not... My ministry's not a personal contact to each one; it's to lift up Jesus Christ so everyone can see His Presence. Then you look and live, everyone one of you. Look and believe, that's all it is. In Africa and different countries where Brother Baxter and I have ministered in the Name of the Lord, it's worked marvelous. I've heard people say that after the service is over, they'd see the Lord perform one outstanding thing, 54-0825, We Have Found Him, St. Nicholas Arena, New York, NY, 42 min maybe thousands would be healed at the same time, just literally thousands get up out of chairs, and cots, and stretchers.

L-7 See, there's nothing in a man could heal you anyhow. I'm just your brother. I... If there's any way that I could heal someone and would not do it, I'd be a brute at heart, to see little suffering children and people with heart trouble, and cancer, such things that would kill them right away. Maybe their doctor's done all that they know how to do for them and there's nothing can save their life. They're calling for mercy from God. Life isn't a flower bed of ease for me; I have my critics. But I must. Jesus said I must. Jesus said that all must do that, that's followed Him. He had them and I must have them. But from the very depths of my heart, and God knows the integrity of my heart, I'm only trying my best to do something to help poor suffering humanity, when their last chance is gone as far as the doctor is concerned, to try to help them to be well.

L-8 When I do get a chance to sleep at night, I can lay down with this thought in my mind, "I've done my best. I've done all I know how to do to make life a little more pleasant to my fellow citizens, pilgrims, travelers on the road home to heaven." And I trust that you'll receive it in that manner. Now, I wish to read a little Scripture at this time. And I know that my words is the word of a man. This is God's Word, the Bible. And all Scriptural doctrine must be based upon this Word. If it's anything contrary to the Word, it's not right. It must come out of the Bible. And no matter who would come to you, prophet, priest, potentate, what, if he speaks contrary to this, it's not right. This is the Word.

L-9 This is the Word to the nations. But God has set in the Church prophets, apostles, teachers, evangelists, gifts, and so forth, for the edifying of the Body. Maybe there'd be something individual with your life that you'd need just a little lift to do something; God has gifts in the Church to do that. Some of them are great speakers who can reveal the--the Bible with great forceful speaking. That's one way. Another thing He has is the prophets in the Scripture, who can interpret the--the meaning of this person. A seer who sees what this person has done in life, being perfectly secret to him, know what was. If he knows what has been in your life, you know whether that's right or not. Surely if he knows what has been in life, if he'd tell you what will be, if the first was right, the second will be right. See, it's got to be.

L-10 That's the way we accepted the Bible. When Moses wrote the chronology, the--the beginning, the Genesis and so forth, we--we accept what he said, knowing it was right from the way the world was laid out. Then we believe that his prophecy that was to come would be right. And we've seen the most of it fulfilled. Now, in there sometimes He has gifts in the Church. We've made havoc, the Church has. Some of them has denied the gifts altogether, and put it on another age. Some people has tried to impersonate the gifts and made a disgrace out of it. That still means there's a real genuine gift of God. If there's a bogus dollar, it only shows there's a real dollar it was made off of. If it isn't, the bogus is the real.

L-11 If you'd pick up a dollar and it's counterfeit you know that some counterfeiter has looked off of a real dollar to make that. The only way you can tell is take the numbers of it, and run it back to the mint, and find out whether it's right or not. That's the way when anyone speaks concerning Christ, run it back to the Bible and find out whether it's right or not. That's the final proof. This is the Mint. And may the Lord bless you tonight as I try to minister to you in the humble way that I have, to try to bring blessings to you and to help you pilgrim travelers on your road to glory. Standing behind the curtain just a few moments ago, when my dear beloved Brother Baxter spoke, and said, "How many is here tonight that doesn't even have prayer cards and wants to be healed?" Hands went up everywhere. My heart sunk. I looked around and I said, "My! Pray for me, I'm just a bit nervous." To see the people wanting to be healed, the press... It's a sick world that we're living in. That's right.

L-12 But Jesus Christ the same yesterday, today, and forever, has produced and has purchased your healing at Calvary. "He was wounded for our transgressions; He was bruised for our iniquity. The chastisement of our peace was upon Him, and with His strips we were healed." It's a finished work. Just like your salvation, if you're a sinner, look up to Him tonight and accept your salvation by faith. He doesn't save you tonight. There's not a sinner in the whole city of New York tonight, but what's already saved in the Kingdom of 54-0825, We Have Found Him, St. Nicholas Arena, New York, NY, 42 min God. But it'll never do them any good till they accept their salvation. You wasn't saved two years ago, or ten ago, or forty years ago. You were saved two thousand years ago, or nineteen hundred and something, when Jesus died for you. You believe that. That's teaching of the Gospel.

L-13 You were healed back there two thousand years ago, when Jesus died at Calvary. You have to accept it tonight. How can you know about your salvation unless there's a preacher sent to point you to Calvary where your salvation was purchased. The same as it is by Divine healing. How do you know about healing 'less God does something, or sends someone to point you to the finished work of Calvary. And that's what I'm here to do tonight, humbly, in the humble way that I have, is to point you to what Jesus Christ did for every one of you nineteen hundred and something years ago, tonight. In the Scripture, we read something of our dear Saviour just now found in Saint John the 1st chapter, beginning with the 44th verse. Listen closely. Listen to our Saviour, what He was then, see if He is the same tonight.

L-14 Now Philip was of Bethsaida, a city of Andrew and Peter. Philip findeth Nathanael, and said unto him, We have found him, of whom Moses and the law, and the prophets did write, Jesus of Nazareth, the son of Joseph. ... Nathanael said unto him, Can there be any good thing come out of Nazareth? Philip said unto him, Come and see. Jesus saw Philip coming to Him, and He said unto Him, Behold an Israelite indeed, in whom is no guile! Nathanael said unto Him, Whence knowest Thou me? Jesus answered and said unto him, Before that Philip called thee, when thou was under the fig tree, I saw thee. Nathanael answering said unto Him, Rabbi, Thou art the Son of God; Thou art the King of Israel. Jesus answered and said unto him, Because I said unto thee I saw thee under the fig tree, believest thou?...

L-15 Now, shall we pray again? Father, we thank Thee tonight for these words. They're touching and inspiring to our hearts, to know that this same Jesus that said to Nathanael, "I saw you before you come to the meeting; you were under a fig tree praying. I saw thee." Nathanael was ready to receive You at once. And I pray tonight, Father, that You will fulfill Your Word tonight, when You said, "The things that I do, shall you also." And You promised... And the history of the Bible we know, repeats. And now we know that we're living at the end time. And proclaiming the resurrected Lord Jesus, Who's been alive and with us for the past nineteen hundred and something years. He's here tonight. And may He do something tonight that'll make the people understand that He still lives and reigns. He has the reign of every heart that'll submit to Him. And I pray, Father, that You'll do something special tonight, that when we leave here tonight, going to our different homes and places, may we say like those who came from Emmaus, "Did not our hearts burn within us?"

L-16 For do something special tonight, Father. Speak in a way, maybe to some of the newcomers, that they have never seen before. Do something for the people. Get glory out of the service. And now, Father, to your poor, unprofitable servant, I submit myself to Thee. If Thou can use me tonight, Father, to help Your dear children. I stand ready and waiting. And circumcise their hearts and ears and eyes, that what they see, feel, and hear, may it be a lesson to them that Thou art here tonight, the same Lord Jesus. And may they accept it upon the basis of faith, and believe it as the evidence of His resurrection. For we ask it in His Name. Amen.

L-17 All right, let's see. I believe we give out a hundred cards last night. We called just so many of them, I believe up to--to around first twenty-five, or forty, or something. Let's begin tonight at fifty. Who has prayer card fifty? I didn't call fif... to fifty last night, did I? [Blank.spot.on.tape--Ed.] If a doctor can cure you, break your arm, he comes to the house and he's got to have your well before he leaves. He doesn't do that. He only sets your arm; God heals it. Come, sister. Number 52 is left out. Is number--prayer card number 52? All right, lady. (How many have I got? How many? Where was I calling from? Fifty to--fifty to sixty?)

L-18 All right, now, 61, 62. Who's got 61, would you raise your hand? 61, stand up quickly so we can hurry. 61? All right, 61, 62, 63...?... Go on up to 75, let's take up to 75. Now, 61, 62, 63, 64, 65. [A brother speaks to the congregation 54-0825, We Have Found Him, St. Nicholas Arena, New York, NY, 42 min an explanation for the prayer line--Ed.] Let's see if we got some more. What... whenever we get some more room, we will call the rest of them. Is that enough right now? What it is, friends, in my office at home, I get this kickback all the time and say, "Brother Branham, I was setting there. I was deaf. My number was called. They told me too late." Well, then... "I couldn't get up. I couldn't even raise my hands."

L-19 Look at one another's cards and see if they got any of those numbers in there. If they have send them on up. Some of them said, "I couldn't even speak English, and no one told me." Look at your neighbor's card and see if they... When their number's called, bring them on up, for that's--that's the way we--we're supposed to do this. And then we see, then it's not my fault. I--I called the numbers and--and... But I can't help it when they... But you really don't... If you just have faith, that's all you need, is faith in God. That's all you have to have. All right we'll see if they got, the... All righty, all right, now we'll see what... If our Lord... If our sister on the organ, you the organist there, if you would, sister dear, would you kind of cord lowly, "Abide With Me," or something on that order, if you please? If you please.

L-20 And I'm going to ask each one in here, from the depths of our heart, that you'll be reverent. I know it's very hot. But you see, friends... [Blank.spot.on.tape--Ed.] You may not understand this. How many's here for their--never seen one of my meetings before? Let's see your hands go up, anywhere in the building. See? See almost half the audience never seen a meeting before. Now, when Jesus was here, He didn't claim to be a great healer or something, did He? No. Here's what He said in Saint John 5:19, "I do nothing in Myself. I only do what the Father shows Me to do; that doeth the Son likewise." Is that Scripture? And He said He done nothing else. Said, "Verily, verily, I say unto you, the Son can do nothing in Himself. But what I see the Father doing, that doeth the Son likewise. For the Father showeth the Son what He doeth. The Father worketh, and I worketh hitherto."

L-21 Now, Jesus said, "These things that I do, shall you also." Is that right? Said, "A little while and the world won't see Me no more, yet you'll see Me, for I'll be with you even in you to the end of the world." Now, Jesus is the One Who's done everything for you. There's nothing I could do or no one else. Jesus has already did it. Now, you just have to look at Him and believe it. And I'm going to ask you to be just as reverent as you can. Of course, when visions come, after one or two, I become subconscious, not knowing where I am, or what's going on. They tell me about it. I never know what happens in the meeting.

L-22 They tell me after the meeting, when they pick it up on the... See that bunch of tape recorders there? If you want to find out what taken place, just ask them. That's where it's, every bit right down, every word that's said. And you watch closely what He tells you. Don't move around. And if any time I'd have to call your attention, be reverent, be quiet, bow your head. Do just what He tells you to do, no matter what it is. And here's the whole secret of all, yielding yourself to the Holy Spirit. It's the only thing it is. You're born for certain things, and then you just yield yourself. It's like having a dream, only you're not asleep. Your conscience is right by your subconscious; you break from one to the other. You're not asleep; you're wide awake, and yet you see visions. The Lord bless you now. And if the brethren will, bring the lady.

L-23 Now, in the prayer line, to you that's back in the rooms, that's lined up, if you do not with all your heart believe, don't you come in the prayer line. If you have sin that you don't want called out publicly, you better confess if before coming to the prayer line (See?), for it'll be--it'll be made known. So you pray, have faith. When you come up here, just stand still. I may ask you--if I ask you anything, then you speak back. If I don't ask you and it's Him talking, it's not me then; don't do it; you break the vision. Just let Him get through talking, then you can hear me again. Now, be reverent.

L-24 Now, to the audience out there, here's the lady who stands here before me, just a perfect stranger. I suppose we're strangers to each other. I have never seen her in my life, know nothing about her. God knows that. Now, if--if Jesus Christ has risen from the dead, as we believe He has, what if He was standing here now? Now, He said we'd do the same thing He would. 54-0825, We Have Found Him, St. Nicholas Arena, New York, NY, 42 min If she--she's here trying to--to get something, whatever it is, He would know about it if God would show Him. Is that right? And He would... Not only her, but He'd know you out there in the audience. If your faith comes to a place that could touch the hem of His garment, like the woman did at the...?... it would be the same.

L-25 Now, the woman is perhaps here for some cause, or she wouldn't be up here in the prayer line. A few minutes ago, she was probably give... Or hour ago or so, she was given a prayer card. Just happened to be that she was called up here in--in--in the prayer line. Now, if there's anything in that woman's life, or anything that she wants, anything she desires, or maybe it's sickness, maybe it's financial, maybe... I don't know what it is. Maybe she's got someone that's gone, or I don't know. But she's just coming to me tonight for some purpose. If Jesus was here in person, in flesh... He is here in flesh, but it's in your flesh. As we yield ourself to Him, our self dies out and Jesus takes up. Now, He could tell her what her troubles was. Is that right? That's what He did in the Bible. Then if He does, and will reproduce Himself just like He did to Nathanael here, when He said He saw him before that he come to the service, what he did, and will you all believe on Him with all your heart? Just everyone in here believe on Him with all your heart. Thank you. Now, may He bless you.

L-26 Now, being the first patient, I might talk to the woman just a minute like our Lord did the woman at the well. He talked to her long enough till He caught her spirit. Then He knew where her trouble was. Now, the same thing, if Jesus was talk--here talking to her--talking to you tonight, sister... Now, I just want to speak with you a moment in order... You're just--you're woman, I'm a man. That's--that's all we know, standing here. And we are perhaps born years apart, miles apart, and first time of ever meeting in life. Now, when our Master, our Lord met a woman at the well, He begin to talk to her for a few moments. Did you ever think, wonder why He talked to her? I believe He was trying to contact her spirit. And when He found where her trouble was, He told her where her trouble was.

L-27 And she said, immediately, "I perceive that Thou art a prophet. And we know when Messiah comes, that He will tell us these things." That's Jesus. But she didn't know where He got it, said He was a prophet. And she run into the city and said, "Come, see a Man Who told me," what she had done. Now, if He is alive tonight, not dead in the grave, but alive tonight, resurrected and living in His Church, He's obligated to His Word. And then if I've made a confession, and said that He told me these things by witness of an Angel, which has been confirmed around the world, then I believe He will talk with us. Do you believe? And if He would tell me something about you, that you know I know nothing of you, would you accept then Him, and believe that you're standing His Presence?

L-28 Now, there's the Holy Spirit. In the Name of Jesus Christ the Son of God, I take every person in here under my control for the glory of God. I want you to look on me just a minute, lady. Are you aware that something's going on? Now, so the audience will know that something changed, just the last moment here, raise up your hand so that they'll see. Yes. Now, it's a feeling like sweet, humble. You know it's Something besides your brother, isn't it? Now, your attitude towards That will determine what it is. You are a believer? You're a believer, a Christian woman. And you're... Now you're moving out from before me. You are... You got something... It--it's in your blood. It's a blood stream condition. It's kind of, you needing shots, like in--insulin. It's diabetes; you have diabetes. You got diabetes.

L-29 And I see you're--you're extremely nervous. You pace a whole lot and drop things, and things. It's a real nervous condition. You're--and you're--I see you've been in a doctor's office or something, and they give you an examination. And I see it... It's up around the head here. It's... he's... it's sets... He's got another doctor, kind of a strong looking man, and he's say's it's got a tumor on the brain. And it's pushing against the optical nerve, which is running you blind. And... Those things are true. Now, that wasn't me; that was Him. You believe it now? You believe He's anointing? Then He said, "These signs shall follow them that believe. If they lay hands on the sick, they shall recover."

L-30 Now, Father God, as Thy Spirit here to revealed, Thou has said the very secret of the hearts of the people, make known their deeds. I pray with my hands laid on our sister, that You will condemn the sickness, or the disease of her 54-0825, We Have Found Him, St. Nicholas Arena, New York, NY, 42 min body, or whatever it was that Thou hast told to her, and may she go from here tonight and be made well for Your glory. In Jesus Christ Name I do this act. Amen. God bless you, sister. Go, rejoicing now, happy, thanking God for your healing. All right. You believe on the Lord now with all your heart? Now, you out there without prayer cards, that can't--won't be called up in the line, I want you to look this way and believe with all your heart. Say, "Lord, let Your servant talk to me and tell me what's my trouble, or something another about me. I'll believe You with all my heart." Now, you do that and see what He will say.

L-31 How do you do, sir. Now, supposingly you and I are strangers to each other, sir. We do not know one another. Only God knows us both. He's knowed you since you was--before you were born. Before the world began He knew you and knew that you would stand here tonight. God knew that. He's fed you all the food you ever eat. And we're perfect strangers to each other. Do you believe that you're in His Presence? Not your brother, but into His Presence? You believe that He's able to tell me what you're here for, or something another that would--would help you? The man is going from me. Years ago your trouble started. You probably look fifteen years or more younger than what you are now. It's a nervous condition. You've been bothered with a nerve trouble. I see you can't sleep. You're up pacing around, restless. It's a nerve cause; you don't know what it is. Doctors can't locate what it is. They don't know what it is.

L-32 But here's what it is. As a child you was playing near a cellar steps, and you got... you fell. And it's put a--a vertebrae that's slightly out in the back. There is your trouble. I hear... you're... You didn't come from this city. You come from another city where there's a river or something run. It's--it's New Jersey, Camden, New Jersey. Your name is Frank. They call you Frank Sask...?... You're healed, sir. Your faith has made you well...?... God...?... Believe on the Lord Jesus Christ and you can be healed or saved, whatever you have need of. Our blessed Redeemer will do these things for you. All right, would you bring your patients?

L-33 Lady, do you believe with all your heart, setting there? Right there with--bowing your head, looking at me with the little green dress on there, yes, you, stand up. No, the little lady right here behind you, Sister Brown. That Light hangs over you. You have an eczema, breaking out. You believe Jesus Christ heals you now? You accept your healing? God bless you. Go home; you're going to get over it now. God's going to make you well. God bless you. Howdy do? Excuse me. Now, be--be reverent. Only believe; have faith in God. Now, I want you to believe whatever is said. Now, you accept your healing right where you are. Look this a way, lady. Now, oh the lady can't speak English. You're here to interpret for her. I will look at her.

L-34 Tell her I said, "Look on me." I am a stranger to you, but God knows you. You are a believer. You're from the--the Baltic's. You are here for--not for yourself. You're here for a--a loved one, which is a husband. That husband has ulcers. He's in a building; it's a hospital. You're living here now, like White Plains or somewhere, White Plains, New York. That's where you're from. You also want healing. You got arthritis. She's going to find her husband's going to get well, and you are healed of the arthritis. Go on your road rejoicing. Jesus Christ makes you whole through His blessed power. Amen, Lord. Amen.

L-35 Do not fear, have faith in God. (Now, just a minute...?... right here I get my breath just a minute. Holy Spirit's moving in the audience real deep just now. Just a minute. Give me just a little bit of time.) This is the person? Howdy do? We are strangers to each other. We do not know each other. God knows us both; you believe that? The little colored lady setting right there at the end, was just been praying the last few minutes that God would heal her with that tumor. He did do it, lady. You don't have any prayer card, do you? So you can stand up now. Your tumor is gone. Jesus Christ has healed you. Amen.

L-36 Us being strangers to one another, the Lord knows what you're here for, doesn't He? I see you being moved into some kind of a building with a sheet over you. It was a hospital. And you went under an operation in recent years. And they cut into you for inward trouble. And they cut you, tore you all up. You're suffering now with a stomach trouble. And also, you've got... Where they operated they made a mistake and it's broke through and you got a rupture in the place where it was at. That is the truth. Do you believe that that comes, that resource of knowing that come from the 54-0825, We Have Found Him, St. Nicholas Arena, New York, NY, 42 min Lord Jesus Christ? If you do, and accept it so, surely He Who stands here, Who takes a man like myself and know those things, do you accept it to be Jesus Christ?

L-37 Then He said this, "They shall lay hands on the sick and they shall recover." You believe it? Then I lay my hands upon thee, my sister, and condemn the disease of your body, and say, "Satan, leave her. In the Name of Jesus Christ may she be made well." Amen. God bless you. The Lord Jesus Christ be with you. Howdy do, sir? I suppose that you and I are strangers to each other. We don't know one another. This is our first meeting time. But there's somebody Who is present now Who knows both of us. That's His Majesty, that we'll stand in His Presence at the day of the judgment to give an account for everything that's in our lives.

L-38 You're suffering with a trouble in your eyes. And you also have a stomach trouble. That stomach trouble is the same cause of your eyes. It's a nervous trouble. Astigmatism for one thing, and another thing is a peptic condition in the stomach, making you to... peptic ulcer in your stomach. You can't eat very well. And it causes you to smother and everything after eating, sensitive on your teeth. Also you're... You got a loved one: it's a woman. And you're interested in her. She's a--she's a--a--she's a sister-in-law. And she's in an institution, a mental institution. You are a minister. You was coming to this meeting last night and had to preach, the reason you didn't come. Go and believe on the Lord Jesus Christ, and you shall have what you ask for. You believe Him?
