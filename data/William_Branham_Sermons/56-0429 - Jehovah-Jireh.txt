--- TRANSCRIPT ---

L-1 Thank you very much. You may be seated. I'm sorry that I have such a graspy throat today. But this is four months straight in service. And now, it just seems like it just going from one to another. I wonder if you can hear me? Can you hear me all right? Can you hear me up in the balcony? Fine. I'm... I guess my zeal is eating up my wisdom. And I preach a lot, then all the hours I pray, and then another thing I get hot real easy and... when I'm speaking, and... As I was saying last night about my hair coming out, that's not a natural thing. That was an accident. A barber did it. He was going to put some stuff on my hair to take the dandruff out. It did: carbolic acid. So medicine's all right, but you want to know who's giving it to you. One dose killed my father. So... And one treatment fixed me all up. So just know who's giving it. That's the same way I think about salvation. I want to know where it comes from. I want to know if somebody's talking about it that's had an experience of what they're talking about. That's what makes it so real, when Jesus becomes so real to us.

L-2 I'm--I'm standing probably a little too close to this. [Brother Branham coughs--Ed.] A little more conscious of my hoarseness than I guess that I should be. But as far as I know I don't have no cold. It's just preach, preach four months straight all the way from the frozen regions of the north to the jungles of the south. And just change one day in one place and in a couple of days somewhere else. And that does it. Constantly speaking outside in all kinds of weather. So we're happy to be here. Happy to be in Carolina. This has been indeed to me a great thrilling time to visit the Carolinas. And as I said the other night, I believe like that the wine at the wedding supper; they're all left the best for last. I don't mean that any disregards to other states. They've all been very nice. And rest the whole world, that I visited, has been very nice. But I've certainly... The Carolina people has found a warm place in my heart that'll be there until I meet you in the rapture. This little pastor here, Brother Jeffery, what a wonderful little character. He and Brother, I believe, Parson and Brother Bigby, the three pastors that I've met in the association that... in these revivals. How wonderful they've been to me. How I appreciate them all. So glad that Carolina has ministers like that.

L-3 Just got a chance a few minutes ago to shake hands with some of the clergyman behind me. Just a good old warm pump-handle handshake. I like it like that, don't you? We--we forgot that. I hope my wife forgives me. She's setting back there. I'd call her up here, but she'd faint. She's so bashful. She's like me. So... I was very bashful once, but I had to get out of it for the Lord. So... But she is very bashful. And I called her on the platform one time... She seen me go into visions many times at the house. She'd just step out of the room. But the first time she was ever on the platform was a few months ago. Mr. Moore kinda tricked her into it and got her to the platform when the anointing had already come on. She said, "I--I don't desire to be around that no more."

L-4 And so... But if there's any credit to be given to the Branham family, let it go to her. She's the one who deserves it. She stands between me and the public. Thirty-seven years old, almost completely white headed, and a real mother, a sweetheart, a wife. I trust that all of you boys, when you get married, you get a wife like God gave me. And I am so happy for her and my children, Billy Paul, little Rebekah, Sarah, and little baby Joseph. We greet you all. And we thank you for your kindness. A few moments ago they... I think they taken up a love offering for me. I didn't... They didn't have to do that, wasn't asked to, just a courtesy. I could've been a multi-millionaire. You know that. If I'd just taken what was given. One offering, one bank draft was over a million five hundred thousand dollars. I refused to look at it, when the agents brought it to me. So I don't want people's money. I want their confidence. I can win them to Christ. 56-0429, Jehovah-Jireh, Abundant Life Center, Charlotte, NC, 100 min

L-5 I'd rather have... You got some lovely homes here. I been driving around your city, some fine places. But you know, I'd rather... Now, I--I appreciate that. Oh, you don't know how glad I am to see God prosper someone. I love it. But the Lord just give me a home. It's a parsonage. It belongs to the church that I used to pastor. I just live there. But I--I tell you; I'd rather have favor with God than anything I know of. And I can't have favor with God and not favor with you all. You all are the one who works with me in Christ. If you didn't believe me this afternoon, there'd be nobody here. What good would my message do to the people, if there's nobody here to receive. What good would it do if it fell on hearts that were stony and didn't believe it? See? You're just as much into it as I am, or the rest. All together we're co-workers in Christ Jesus.

L-6 As I was speaking about my wife a few moments ago... Thought first I'd let it past by but it's just too good. She'll tell me about that on the road home this afternoon. You know, I--I just... I like old fashion things. That's the reason I like the old fashion Gospel. I believe that when you handshake, it's just not a reach out. I like one of them real good old timey ones. See? Like we used to have. Love seems to be failing in our generation. I was downtown sometime ago with my wife, and a lady said, "How you do, Sister Branham?" I seen my wife turn. I looked around at her. I said, "Honey, that lady spoke to you." She said, "I spoke to her." I said, "I didn't hear it." She said, "I smiled." "Oh," I said, "Honey, that's not a... One of those silly opossum grins is not an hello." I said, "I--I like to hear somebody holler, 'hello.' I like to... for you to really speak and use the old fashion way."

L-7 I remember Brother Bosworth, Doctor F. F. Bosworth. If he ever comes this way, greet him. He's a lovely brother. And He's retired. He's not retired; he just quit. He thought his ministry was over. That's been about seven or eight years ago. And now he's one of my managers. So we was just down in... We was having a campaign down in Florida. And there was some kind of a duchess or something was letting us have the grounds. So in the afternoon when I had started in, he said, "Brother Branham, the duchess is back here."

L-8 Now, friends, I didn't know then what a duchess is. I don't know any more today. I don't know what one is. But it was some kind of a woman back there, and she was dressed, "Oh, my. Whew." She had enough jewels on her arms to send a dozen missionaries around the world twice. That's not necessary. And she had a pair of specks on a stick, holding it out there that far from her. Now, you know nobody could see through glasses that far away from you. And she was looking out like that. And she said, "Are you Doctor Branham?" I said, "No ma'am; I--I'm not." Said, "Brethren call me, Brother Bill." And she said--had her hand like this; she said, "I'm charmed to meet you."...?... just shoved out her hand. Pulled it down. I said, "Well, sister, get it down here, so I'll know you."

L-9 You know, I just wonder how people put-on like... After all, you're just six foot of ground. I was standing by Biggett Museum here sometime ago. I love art, music. And in this museum there was two young fellows looking at an analysis of a human body of a man that weighed a hundred and fifty pounds. You know how much you're worth if you weigh a hundred and fifty pounds? You're worth eighty-four cents. You got enough whitewash about you to sprinkle a hen's nest, just a little bit of calcium and so forth, just worth eighty-four cents. Think of it sister, putting a thousand dollar mink coat on, nose turned up, if it'd rain, you'd drown. And thinking you're somebody when you're only worth eighty-four cents. That body took... That boy over there said "Well..." One looked over and said, "John, we're not very much after all, are we?" I thought this was my chance. I tapped him on the back. I said, "That's truly, boys. But you got a soul that's worth ten thousand worlds." That's right. "Take care of that soul, let the eighty-four cents go. Watch that soul for it'll live forever." And that's true friends. 56-0429, Jehovah-Jireh, Abundant Life Center, Charlotte, NC, 100 min

L-10 Now, with this is mind... And I--I'm ashamed to even try to read that same text again. I been two times on it, never did get to it. You're such a wonderful audience I believe could stay on that same text six months. I remember one time in my church at home, I preached nearly a year on Job. And I had him on the ash heap back there for about four months. Some nice lady, very diplomatic one, she was too nice to just to come up and tell me. But she wrote me a nice little letter. She said, "Reverend Branham, I--I'm sure enjoying every one of them messages. But when are you going to get Job off the ash heap?" Well, I was waiting for a climax. Got several souls to the altar when Job went off the ash heap. I just love the Old Testament. It's in nuggets. And every one of them point to Christ Jesus at Calvary.

L-11 Now, friends, if there's been any blessing or anything that our time has been. We don't know unless we're led to places. And I know it's been a blessing to us. Not only have you been blessed, but we've been blessed by coming. And now, I trust to God, that the meetings will mean lots to you, and that you people who have been saved will join some good spirit filled church. And all these pastors, I pray that their ministry will be blessed exceedingly, abundantly. All you people prosper in health. God bless you all till I see you again. Pray for me. And if I have to go before I see you again, I want you to do me a favor. If I go and my body can be buried, when they let me down in the ground, they're going to sing, 'Only believe.' So if you hear on the radio or the news or somewhere that I'm gone, stop just a few minutes and hum, 'Only Believe.' I believe I'll come out from among the dead someday.

L-12 Most all Branhams when they get old... Some of them live long lives. My grandmother was a hundred and ten. My grandfather died at ninety-seven. My grandmother on my mother's side, she died young with...?... But she was the one that was a half breed, Cherokee Indian. And my grandfather died about four years ago, on mother's side, being somewhere in his nineties. My father went at fifty-two. I don't when that will come. But usually when they get old, the Branhams... It's just the nature like Isaac went blind, Jacob went blind, both of them prophets and so forth, just seem to run in their family stream.

L-13 The Branhams when they get old, they go to shake with the palsy. I expect if I live, someday I've got to preach my last sermon, pray for the last sick person. I hope that I'm an old man when He gets finished with me if Jesus tarries. I've come all the way through every briar patch, every hard place. I come down to the river, and I can feeled its dashers coming. The foam coming in from out there and I know my time is come. Standing with the gray hairs hanging around my shoulders and shaking with a stick in my hand, I want to take off my helmet, lay it down, stick the old sword here back in the sheath of eternity, scream out, "Father, send out the lifeboat. I'm coming over this morning." He will be there. I don't worry about that. That's been settled for twenty five years. It's more settled today in my heart than it ever was. I know who I believe. I'm persuaded He's able to keep that which I've committed to Him against the day. I hope to see you over there.

L-14 And until then I've got a trip to Africa and many places coming. When the winds are blowing hard, the hot breezes across the country, and I'm standing and challenge of witch doctors and so forth, will you promise you be praying for me? Will you do it? I'll pray for you. Now, let us speak to Him. Our heavenly Father, we thank Thee today for Jesus Thy Son. Closing this revival... Not closing it, Lord, may it just be beginning. May the influence of Your visit with us never leave these people until Jesus comes. Then start an old fashion revival throughout the city and the state, every church; all the full Gospels, Methodists, Baptists, Presbyterians, Nazarenes, whatever they are, Father. Send a great revival to this city.

L-15 Bless these handkerchiefs that are here before us. O Eternal God, let Your Spirit come upon each of them and bless them, that they'll be healed as they go to their destination. When they're laid upon the sick folks that they're intended for, may diseases leave their body. Bless this lovely audience, Lord. Bless Brother Jeffery. God be with these other pastors. Be with all these members of their churches everywhere and all the pastors of the city and throughout the region. Grant these things to us, Father. Give us just a little voice to speak a great healing service. May many find their way to Christ and many be healed. For 56-0429, Jehovah-Jireh, Abundant Life Center, Charlotte, NC, 100 min we ask it in Jesus' Name, Thy Son. Amen.

L-16 The same text Genesis 22. Satan says you can't finish it. I can't, but God can. We brought Abraham from the time that he was called of God and was brought to a place where he'd received the promise in figurative form. Last night we left him as El Shaddai, God speaking to him. Then we got over to where God promised through Sarah and Abraham and showed a sign what He was going to do for all of His children. How many was here last night? Let's see your hands. Do you believe it? Say, "Amen. Then our hope is built on nothing less Than Jesus' blood and righteousness; All around my soul gives way And is all my hope and stay. On Christ, the solid Rock, we stand; All other ground is sinking sand. Science fails; everything else fails; God's Word can't fail.

L-17 I was with a great doctor here not long ago, doctor of science. He give a--a degree to a boy, a young fellow, a friend of mine. And as he embraced him, as receiving his degree in science, he was from Washington, and he embraced him and pinned this thing on him. And he said, "Son, after all these years of studying in science," he said... In Washington or somewhere, some hall of science, I forget how many books was written on the latest science. He said, "It would take you at least two years, if you read day and night, to read them all through. And by the time you got them all read through, then you'd have to discard everything that you learned, it's advanced so fast, till them things that's scientifically proven now would be scientifically proven to be wrong then."

L-18 I stood and waited. That night that same man at Shreveport, Louisiana, set in my meeting. I'd seen him. I said, "Now, I'm glad to have the doctor here with us tonight." And I heard his remark what he said. That when this young student, who's here now with us, a leader of this music here tonight on the platform, but if he would take two years how science will absolutely prove that the things that they once proved to be right, they proved again to be wrong. When I went to school they told me the sun set perfectly still and the world went around it. That's scientifically proved to be a lie now. The sun runs also. That's right. See? So I suppose Joshua wasn't so ignorant after all when he prayed for God to stop the sun. See? It always comes back to the Book. Here sometime ago science said, "Oh, my. Isn't that awful. That that Bible says that God said, 'As a man thinketh in his heart.' There's no mental facilities in his heart to think by." But you know what? Last year they found out God was right. The soul lives in the heart and not in the mind. That's right. So God was right. "As a man thinketh in his heart, so is he." Not as his intellectuals introduced to him, but as his soul tells him. It can't fail there.

L-19 Now, so I said to that scientist. I said, "Sir, them books will fail and always will fail. But I can tell you a Book that you'll never have to take back anything It ever says. It'll always be proven to be true. That's God's Word." "Heavens and earth will pass away," said Jesus. "But My Word shall never fail." I love that. Abraham trusted in God's Word. And we're children of Abraham today, because we trust in God's Word. We believe, regardless of what people says, and what theologians say, educators say, science says. If it's contrary to the Word, every man's word is a lie and God's is true. It's the way I believe it. And no matter how strange it may seem. I believe it to be true anyhow.

L-20 Now, I want you to notice. Abraham... Now, we're going to finish up the text just for a few minutes before we start the prayer line. Could you imagine this little boy, Isaac, being born? Abraham and Sarah... Now, about a hundred and fifteen years old was Sarah and about a hundred and twenty five years old was Abraham. Way... here's the promised child, that pretty little boy about sixteen years old, little hair hanging down over his shoulder, a handsome little lad. How he loved his father and his mother and just as obedient... 56-0429, Jehovah-Jireh, Abundant Life Center, Charlotte, NC, 100 min You know, children, that's what you ought to be to your father and mother. I think it's awful when you hear young people say, "My old man and my old woman."

L-21 I don't believe you people in Carolina, you little children would say that. Way up in the northern lands where I come from they say it. See? And it's too bad they ever say it. Listen. That's not the old man and old woman. Someday when the floors is creaking and cracking and a casket is going out and you look and see a gray headed person laying there, it won't be the old man then. That's your daddy. That's your mother. You honor them now. That's the first commandment with promise. "Honor your father and mother, which may lengthen the days on the earth that the Lord giveth thee." So, little Isaac being so sub--subject... in subjection to his father and mother because he was a type of Christ as He was in subject to the Father perfectly. And how he minded his father and mother.

L-22 And one day God said, "Now, Abraham, you know way down years to come there's going to be a people, all kinds of scientific things, and they're going to try to disprove My Word. But I want to double My Word. After I swore I'd keep it. I'll let you live to see the day. When you was a hundred years old and I turned back you back to a young man of about twenty five, thirty five years old again, you and Sarah... And you brought forth this child. You see My hand?" "Now, I'm going to give an example for the people in Charlotte today and for everywhere else just how I will keep My Word. Now, I tell you what I want you to do, Abraham. I want you to take your little boy and go to a certain mountain, where I'm going to show you. And I want you to take him up there, and lay him on an altar, and offer him up for a sacrifice. I want you to kill him Abraham, because in him I'm going to bless all the world."

L-23 Doesn't that sound strange? How was that boy... How was Abraham now, after waiting all... a hundred years to receive this child and the child being born. That was their last. Sarah never had no more. That was all of it. And how could this be now, after he's waited all this time, and the young man here now is about sixteen. Now, take him up and destroy the only hope that you have of My promise being fulfilled. Wish I had just a little more voice. I'd just like to show you something here. See? Sometimes God takes away everything. Let the doctor tell you you're going to die. That's right. Prove it. Scientifically show you you're going to die. Just to show His Mercy to you. Doctor says that cancer, "We got nothing for it." You know I heard on the radio the other day. That there has never been one successful cancer operation. That's right. We haven't got nothing for it. We haven't the medical science. God has in His science.

L-24 Moses brought the children of Israel all the way through the land of Egypt. And when they come out of Egypt, with that two million people... And when they left Egypt, there wasn't a feeble person among them. How did he for forty years fight cancer, tuberculosis? How many babies was born overnight? How many houses did Doctor Moses have to visit? How many broken arms and out there in that desert running around? How much pneumonia? How much malaria drank out in ponds and whatever they could get to? How much bacteria did they pick up and those germs and things in the water? Say doctor, wouldn't you like to look into Moses' medicine kit and find out what he kept them people all well. And not even their clothes got threadbare. Wouldn't you... How many would like to look in Doctor Moses' medicine kit? Would you like to see it? I know where it's at in the Bible. Would you like to hear it? Raise up your hand if you would. Just a minute. I'll show you just exactly where it's at. We'll see there where Doctor Moses said...

L-25 Doctor Moses had one prescription. He kept them all well with it. "I'm the Lord that healeth all thy diseases." That's the only prescription he used. And it worked on every case. Say that's a good thing for a doctor to pack in his briefcase, isn't it? "I'm the Lord Who healeth all thy diseases." That's what Moses used. And it kept people alive for forty years and not a feeble one among them. Isn't that wonderful? Because he used God's Word. You can't go wrong as long as you're using the Word. Stay with the Word.

L-26 Now, God said to Abraham, "Take your little boy out there. I'll show you a mountain. And you go upon this mountain and kill him." Now, what if Abraham said, "Now wait, was that vision true? Let me study now. Was that vision true? Now, God said for me to take my boy and kill him. Now, how am I ever going to be the father of nations, and that's my seed and that's 56-0429, Jehovah-Jireh, Abundant Life Center, Charlotte, NC, 100 min a promised seed. Now, how am I ever going to be the father of nations when God is destroying the only hope I have here. Is that the only hope that I have? No, I still got His Word. He promised be back there that He'd do it. And through Isaac all the world would be blessed." So he said, "I..." Listen to Abraham now. "I received him as one from the dead. I'm persuaded that God's able to raise him up from the dead." Oh, my. Even with a hoarse throat, I feel religious. Sure. Abraham said, "If I received him as one from the dead..." What?

L-27 The seed in his own body was dead at a hundred years old. The deadness of Sarah's womb, they were both sterile to being with. And then if God performed a miracle and put this germ of life in there, he received him from the dead, as one being dead, then God's able to raise him up from the dead: Perfect type of the Lord Jesus Christ. Hallelujah. Oh, my. If that wouldn't make Presbyterians shout. Think of that. Certainly. Abraham staggered not at the promises of God through unbelief, but was strong, giving praise to his Name.

L-28 I can imagine. It was on Sunday afternoon when He spoke to him maybe. On Monday morning how's he going to do? Poor little Isaac, he looks at him. Oh, he loves him. But I can't look at that. I got to think of obeying of God. So he couldn't tell Sarah. 'Cause, you know, the ladies are the weaker vessel. So you sometime you have to watch. "So I--I can't tell Sarah 'cause she wouldn't understand." Sarah never was too strong anyhow in the faith. 'Cause she lacked, she disbelieved the promise. But Abraham held her, because the man and woman are one. The woman could not be saved in the Old Testament only by the man, 'cause it was circumcision. And she had to be joined to her husband in order to receive it. But in the last days, God's poured out His Spirit, and the women are circumcised in the heart just like the man.

L-29 Now... But she believed her husband and called him lord. So he said, "Now, I can't, I--I can't tell Sarah." So he... Maybe say, "Sarah, Isaac and I are going to take a little trip. We'll be back." "How are we coming back? God's able. If He said so, He will bring us back." That's good. So he saddles up a mule the next morning. Cuts some wood and laid it on the mule's back. He's going out in the desert. And now, look. He walked three days. And at the end of the three days, he lifted up his eyes and saw the mountain, where God showed him in the vision, a way off.

L-30 Now, watch. An ordinary man ought to walk twenty five miles a day. When I was patrolling for five years, I walked thirty five miles a day through the wilderness ten hours year in and year out. And today why a man's got gasoline feet nearly and could do that. What could a man in them days whose only transportation he had nearly was either by a little slow mule that he could out walk hisself nearly. So the only way he had was travel by foot. And now, Abraham let's say he walked twenty five miles a day. And he was seventy five miles back down. And he lifted up his eyes, and perhaps maybe another twenty-five or thirty miles away, he saw the mountain. He said, "Yep. That's the one God showed me in the vision."

L-31 Now, he said to the servants, the boys that was with him, listen to this now; he said, "You all tarry here while the boy and I go yonder to worship. The boy and I will return." Oh, my. What? With the knife in his belt and in his heart to do the will of God, was going to kill his own son. "You wait here. The boy and I are going yonder to worship. The boy and I will return." How? He knowed God would keep His Word some way. On they go up to the top of the mountain. Now, watch. When he got to the mountain, he took all this wood and laid it on Isaac's back. Wonder why he done all those things? Because he was a figure of Christ. Isaac packed the wood up the hill that he himself was the sacrifice to lay on. Christ packed the cross up the hill where He, the Sacrifice, was to be laid on. Abraham, shadowed God, the Father, giving His only begotten Son, for our sins. Abraham was giving his only son for obedience to God.

L-32 Notice now. As they go up the hill, Abraham packing the fire. And when they got up there, he said, "Father." He said, "Here I am." He said, "Here is the wood. And here is the fire. Here is the altar. But where is the lamb for the sacrifice?" 56-0429, Jehovah-Jireh, Abundant Life Center, Charlotte, NC, 100 min Oh, could you imagine that Father's heart pumping hard? His only child... "Where is the sacrifice?" Abraham choking back the tears, think of your ownself choking back the tears, with a stern look towards heaven, he said, "My son, God will provide for Himself a lamb for the sacrifice."

L-33 I'm not emotional much but that just gets me. "God will provide for Himself a sacrifice, or a lamb for the sacrifice." He said, "Turn around Isaac. Turn your back to me, son." He did. Isaac thought, "What's this? It's leather cords taking my hands. Surely father understands what he's doing." Around his feet went some cords, tied them together. He looked over. Abraham looked at him, brushed back the hair out of his eyes, kissed him on the cheek, "God be with you, my son." Laid him upon the altar, looked back, choking back the tears, little Isaac, obedient to death not asking a question. Abraham pulled a big knife from his... the sheath from... the knife from the sheath, brushed back the hair away from his little neck, looked up to God and started to take the life of his own son. Just as he raised his hand, the Holy Ghost caught his hand. Said, "Abraham. Stay your hand. For I know now that you love Me, not even to spare your own son."

L-34 And about that time... Oh, God. A--a sacrifice bleated, a little ram, not a female, not a ewe, a ram was caught in the wilderness by his horns. What was it? Jehovah-jireh had provided a lamb. Where did that lamb come from? Where did that lamb come from, friends? You know what it was? Why, he was a hundred miles from civilization. Where did it come from? Besides that he was way upon top of the mountain where there's no water. Where did it come from? It wasn't a vision now. He took the ram, loosed Isaac, his son, raised the ram up and cut its throat and blood run out of it. It was a real lamb, not a myth, neither a vision. It was a real lamb. What was it? The God that I spoke to the other night, brought Hisself down in flesh, had brought a lamb there. Jehovah-jireh had provided a ram for the sacrifice.

L-35 I say to you this afternoon, my Christian friend, that Jehovah-jireh still exists. And that lamb, which was the type of the Lord Jesus Christ that came down from glory and made Hisself a little lower than Angels to suffer death for all, has provided for everything that you have need of this afternoon. And has provided for your salvation. He's provided for your healing. And besides that, He said, "I'll not leave you. I'll pray the Father, and He will send you another Comforter, which is the Holy Ghost. He will abide with you forever. And the things that I do shall you also. Even more than this for I go to My Father." Jehovah-jireh has provided a Sacrifice this afternoon for your sins. Jehovah-jireh has provided the same Lamb this afternoon for your sickness. Can you believe it? And will you believe it?

L-36 When Jesus was here on earth, He said, "A little while and the world won't see Me no more; because I come from God (Spirit), and now, I'm in the world a little while. And now I go back to God. Then I'll come again and be with you," in the form of the Holy Ghost, "in you to the end of the world. And he that believeth on Me, the works that I do shall he do also." Now, He's here. God has provided a way for you. God's provided a sacrifice. He's Jehovah-jireh Who provided for Abraham, carried him through. And you are the seed of Abraham. And as long as you're in Christ Jesus, you are the seed of Abraham and you're heirs of the same promise by the same God, only in a more positive way than Abraham was.

L-37 You've got about twenty eight hundred years of experiences to look back through others and see what He's done. And if the Old Testament provided that, how much better does the new covenant, a better thing. That we without them would not be made perfect... or them without us, rather, would not be made perfect. God has provided. I trust that you will believe it with all your heart as we pray. Now, Father, we thank Thee for being Jehovah-jireh, the Lord's provided Sacrifice. Now, I ask You today, Lord Jesus, that You'll give grace abundantly to all the people that are here. And let them know that You provided a--a resurrection in form there for Isaac, who had come to end of his road. But You provided a way for him. And You provided a way of the resurrection of the Lord Jesus, and provided a Holy Ghost knowing that the time would come when people would try to explain away all the supernatural of Your Word. But You provided the Holy Ghost to 56-0429, Jehovah-Jireh, Abundant Life Center, Charlotte, NC, 100 min carry on Your work, doing the same thing that You did when You were here in a corporeal body. And I pray today that You'll bless exceedingly, and heal the sick, and save the lost. Grant it, Lord, for we ask it through Christ's Name.

L-38 And with our heads bowed I wonder just if there would by chance be some sinner friend here today, that never has accepted this provided Sacrifice, just like to raise up your hand to God. God bless you my brother. "I now accept Christ." God bless you. 'I now want..." God bless you. "I want to now in Christ's Name admit to God that I'm a sinner, and I want His mercy upon me at this time. And I'm not raising my hands to you, Brother Branham. But I'm raising my hands to God and saying, 'I believe that story's the truth, because it comes from the Bible. And I believe that all the Bibles says is right. And I want God to be merciful to me a sinner just now.'" God bless you. God bless you. I see your hand, lady. God bless you, young man; I see your hand. Up in the balcony, anyone up there would say... raise your hands to Jehovah? God bless you, young lady. I see you over there.

L-39 Someone else? Just now, just now Lord God. What makes man press their way? What makes them go right to the--into their life preaching the Gospel. What makes a Christian stand and walk into the face of death without even batting an eye? It's Jehovah-jireh. He's provided a way, a way of escape. You want it? God bless you, sir. You might've done a many a good thing. I have no doubt at all. That's the greatest thing you ever done in your life, when you raised your hand to your Creator and said, "Now, I believe." Someone else? I was looking at a dad just now raising his hand. I think about my own dad. He's done crossed over. As his locks fell across my arm when a doctor give him a dose of medicine, that killed him with an overdose of strychnine... And it killed him. And he just looked up at me, his little Irish eyes... Wish I could see him walk down through these aisles today. But there's somebody else's dad is here. Will you accept it, brother? Believe on the Lord? All right.

L-40 Someone that's backslid then, would raise your hand and say, "God, I want to come back. I feel condemned today. I--I want to come back to Christ. Will you take me back?" Would you raise your hand? One? God bless you, sir. Someone else? Jesus Christ, the Son of God, is here. Someone without the baptism of the Holy Spirit, and you desire to be baptized into the body of believers by the Holy Ghost? There's only one baptism. That's Holy Spirit baptism. Water is only a type. Would you raise your hand? God bless you. Wonderful. Dozens of hands up.

L-41 Then heavenly Father, I give them to Thee. Thou has said in Thy Divine Word, "He that heareth My Word and believeth on Him that sent Me, has Everlasting Life." See as those people raised their hands and watch their expression change. Sure. You can't make an act and not God's order without something happening. How, thank Thee, Father, that they have Eternal Life now. They'll never perish or never come into judgment. You said it. I believe You. And those who've wandered away God, just now speak to their heart. Oh, the way of a transgressor is hard. Nothing but trouble in their way, weary, scared. God, just now may You take all their fears away. Put Your arms around them, say, "Come on back to the sheepfold, My child. That's Me that's speaking to you. It's My voice, the still small voice." God knows who are wanting the baptism of the Holy Spirit. I pray that the glory of God will strike this building this afternoon and every one here will receive the baptism of the Holy Ghost. Grant it, Father.

L-42 May the little church grow and prosper. I commit them to Thee now, believing Thy Word and quoting Thy Word, Lord. Some of these people I may never seen again till I meet at Your face. Then I'll see them. And they'll never forget this day. They can't raise their hand and accept You, without having Eternal Life. You said so, Lord. If that hand beneath it had a foundation of a true honest heart, something happened. You're the One Who said the Word: "They should never perish, never come into judgment, but had past from death unto Life, because they believe. Now, their Yours, Father. We commit them to You in Jesus' Name. Amen.

L-43 I hate to leave you. God bless you, Carolina, everywhere. I'll just tell you good-bye now, 'cause if--if the Lord Jesus does come in His anointing power, I--I don't know when they take me. The only way I know Brother Wood, or some of them comes up here goes to patting me on the side. I know to quit praying right then. See? 56-0429, Jehovah-Jireh, Abundant Life Center, Charlotte, NC, 100 min I don't want to go. When I'm up there, I feel like I'm a giant. When I'm down here, I'm all right. But just come out of there one time. How many every knowed that poets and prophets always considered a little crazy or something, neurotics? Sure. How many ever heard of Stephen Foster? You ought to. Wrote America's best folk songs. "Old Black Joe," "Old Folks at Home," and "Swanee River," "Old Kentucky Home." Do you know every time he'd ever get inspiration and write them old songs, then he'd get on a drunk? You know, finally after he wrote a famous song, he called a servant, took a razor and committed suicide?

L-44 How many ever heard of William Cowper? Let's see your hands. Wrote how many ever heard of this songs, "There is a fountain filled with blood drawn from Emmanuel's veins, when sinners plunge beneath the flood lose all their guilty stains?" William Cowper wrote that. I stood by his grave not long ago, two or three years ago in London, England. I had to shed a tear. He was considered a little crazy. You know after he wrote that song... Did you ever get the history of it? He got in a cab and tried to find the Seine River to commit suicide. He come out of inspiration. See? He didn't know where he was at.

L-45 Look at Jonah, the Prophet. After God keeping him alive three days in the belly of the whale, come out and give his prophecy in such a way that a city the size of St. Louis, Missouri, repented, put sackcloth on their animals. And then went upon a hill after the inspiration left him... A little worm come out and cut a gourd tree down, and he prayed God to take his life (See?), just a neurotic like. Look at Elijah who called for no rain to come, and it didn't come for three years and six months. Then called rain out of the heavens, and then called fire out of the heavens the same day. And when the Holy Spirit left him, and the vision was completed, the Lord fed him some cakes, put him to sleep, woke him up about an hour or two and fed again, and he was so unconscious till he wandered out in the wilderness for forty days and nights. And when God found him... How many knows where He found him? Pulled back in a little cave. Is that right? Didn't know where he was at, wandering around. See? What does it speak of? There's a land beyond the river. That's right. No need to try to explain it. You can't. If prophets and so forth couldn't explain it, how could we? It's just true. That's all.

L-46 Now, how many's here for your first time? Let's see your hands. Just look at the hands. God bless you. So glad to have you. I--I can't do justice, friend, in just a little time like this to explain to you. I just want to ask you something. And I'm sure you second comers will bear with me a minute. My contentions is this: That Jesus Christ is the same yesterday, today, and forever, and the Bible says so. Do the newcomers believe that? Say, "Amen." The Bible... Jesus when He was here on earth, He claimed that He was going back to turn to the Father again in form a Spirit, but would come in the form of the Holy Ghost and would abide with us forever. And the very same works that He did then, He would do through His Church until He come again. How many knows that's true say, "Amen." See? He promised it. He said, "A little while, and the world (Now, what is the world, the worldly minded? See? The worldly minded people, church members and so forth) will see Me no more." Did the church members actually see Him in that day? No, sir. They never seen Him in the light of Who He was. They seen His corporeal body, because they had a sense of sight, those who could see. Those who couldn't see, He gave them their sight, so they could see. He said to them, "It'd be better if you was born blind then you wouldn't know it." See?

L-47 But look. They saw Him in the light that He was a human being. But they didn't see Him in the light of the Son of God, 'cause they said He was a devil and was a mind reader, Beelzebub, the chief of the fortunetellers. But there was some people then who believed Him. Is that right? They were called the common people. Now, what did Jesus do? What was any different from Him than any other man? Now, if we can find out what He was then, He is the same today. If He is the same, if He's raised from the dead, and all that believes that he is, He did raise from the dead and is alive today say, "Amen." Means, "So be it." 56-0429, Jehovah-Jireh, Abundant Life Center, Charlotte, NC, 100 min

L-48 Now, I'm just getting your attention. Now, notice. Then if the man... If this book went down on the floor, and I put this book in its place, that's not resurrection. That's replacement. But if this book went down, if it resurrected, it come back up, it's the same book. Then Jesus in the resurrection to show that it ain't some other somebody else or something else, He's got to be the same. Now, He wasn't no great theologian. He wasn't no scholar. He never went to any seminary. He never had any degree. Not a record of anywhere where He ever even went to any schools or anything like that. But the best of the learned had come to Him for wisdom. His disciples were ignorant and unlearned the Bible said. All but one, but Paul. And Paul said, "I had to forget all that I ever knowed in order to know Jesus Christ." Sometimes we have to do that too: forget what you know so you can learn Christ.

L-49 But now, what did He do? What was this man? Why did a little fellow like Him, no beauty you should desire Him, probably stoop shouldered. He was only thirty, and the people said He looked fifty. Why, said, "You're not a man over... not much over fifty years old and You say you seen Abraham." He was only thirty. His work must've put a tremendous strain on Him, probably gray beard a little and gray in His hair. "And you say you seen Abraham?" He said, "Well, before Abraham was, I am." [Blank.spot.on.tape--Ed.]

L-50 They knew who that was talking through them lips. That was God speaking through those lips. As I said here not long ago, the woman who told me that I put too much emphasis on Jesus being Divine. He was Divine. And He's still Divine. You people that would want to believe Him just to be a prophet; shame on you. If He's just a prophet, we're lost. That's right. If He wasn't anything less than Almighty God, we're lost. That's right. She said, "Mr. Branham, if I can prove to you that Jesus Christ, that He was only a mortal and He wasn't Divine by the Bible, will you believe it?" I said, "If the Bible said so. Yes, 'cause that's His Word." She said, "I will prove it." She said, "When He went down to the grave of Lazarus, Saint John 11," said, "The Bible said He wept. And if He was Divine, He couldn't weep." I said, "Lady, that just shows how thin your ideas are." I said, "He was a man, but He was a God Man. God was in Christ reconciling the world to Himself."

L-51 That's what fooled the Jews. They looked at the man; said, "Now, looky here. Listen to the kind of language He uses. Now the--the grammar, how bad it was." He talked like common people. 'Cause they was the ones who heard Him. "And look how He dresses. Why, that old robe. It's been washed so many times, it's threadbare," Wove throughout without a seam. Martha and Mary made it for Him. "Look at that fellow, you mean to tell me that he knows more about it than our scholarly rabbis and priests and high priest, and stuff, that studied all their life. Who is He? Look He was born down with a black name behind him to begin with as the illegitimate child. Who are you to teach us wisdom?" they say. "What school did you come from? Where did you get these things?" Oh, my, that blasphemy. I said, "Yes, lady. He did cry when He went to the grave of Lazarus. He's a Man among men. But when He stood there, straightened up them little shoulders and said, 'Lazarus, come forth.' And a man that had been dead four days stood on his feet and lived again. That was more than a man. That was God.

L-52 He was a man when He come down off the mountain that night hungry, looking around for something to eat; He was a Man when He couldn't find nothing to eat on that fig tree. That was a Man hungry. But when He take five biscuits and two little fishes and fed five thousand, that was more than a Man there. Sure was. He was a Man that night out in that little boat out there on that wavy sea, storm up. Ten thousand devils of the sea swore they'd drown Him. And that little old boat pitching like a bottle stopper out there. He was a Man laying there so tired and weary till even the waves didn't wake Him up. But when He got up put His foot on the brail of the boat, and looked up, and said, 'Peace be still,' and the winds and the waves obeyed Him, that was more than a Man. That was God. 56-0429, Jehovah-Jireh, Abundant Life Center, Charlotte, NC, 100 min Truly, He cried for mercy at the cross. He cried like a Man when He was dying. But when He rose on Easter morning, He proved He was God. Amen. He's a resurrected One. He's a God-Man. God was in Christ.

L-53 He said, "For My..." That's the reason people couldn't understand Him. Sometime it was Christ speaking... or was the Son speaking. Other times it was the Father speaking. He was a dual Person. He was one Man, the Son. God was in him, which was tabernacling in Him. But what did He do? Did He go around saying, "I'm the Healer." Very contrary, He said, "I'm not the Healer." He said, "It isn't Me that doth the works; it's My Father that dwelleth in Me." And in Saint John the 19th chapter when He was questioned for pasting a whole bunch of crippled, lame, withered, halt, blind people, healed one man laying on a pallet, the Father showed Him to go there and heal. Walked away and left the rest of them laying there, they questioned Him. A man packing his bed on the sabbath. Listen to what He said. Saint John 5:19: "Verily, verily, I say unto you: The Son can do nothing in Himself, but what he sees the Father doing, that doth the Son likewise." Is that what He said? "I do nothing till the Father shows Me a vision first what to do."

L-54 Step back in His life a little bit at the beginning of His ministry and just a couple of places for the newcomers and then we'll close. Look when Philip got converted, went over and found Nathanael, said, "Come, see who we found, Jesus of Nazareth, Son of Joseph." Nathanael had been praying under a tree. He said, "Now, could there be any good thing come out of Nazareth?" Said, "Come, see." That's the best way to find out. Come and see. He come up and stood in the prayer line, perhaps where Jesus was or in the audience where... Jesus as soon as He seen him... He'd never seen him in His life, standing there He said, "Behold, an Israelite in whom there's no guile." Why, now listen close. He said, "Say, Rabbi (Reverend, Teacher), when did You know me? How do You know me? You never seen me in Your life and how do You know me?" He said, "Before Philip called you, fifteen miles around the mountain yonder, when you was under the tree I saw you."

L-55 There stood the priests and the rabbis, the doctors, D.D., double L.D. They said, "Do you know who he is? He's a mind reader. He's Beelzebub, the chief of the devils. Well, all the power, and all the mind readers, he's the chief of them all." Jesus turned and said, "You'll be forgiven for that. You speak that against the Son of man, it shall be forgiven. But one day the Holy Ghost is coming (Hallelujah.) after My blood's shed yonder for you blood thirsty atheists." Said, "You're of your father the devil." He said, "When that blood is shed and the Holy Ghost comes and does the same work that I do, if you speak one word against It, it'll never be forgiven you in this world or the world to come." How many knows that's Scripture? So be careful. Just one word is all you have to get out of line. So you see, where I stand here today? Who am I to stand here with these kind of things? See?

L-56 Now, what did this man that the miracle was performed on... You said, "A miracle? He wasn't healed." A man don't see a healing for a miracle. There's all kinds of miracles. Sure. It was a miracle that He knowed who was under the tree. It was a miracle He knowed who he was. It was a miracle He knowed their names. So he said, "Thou art the Christ, the Son of the living God." He said, "Because I said that, you believe it? You'll see greater than this." That was his sign. That's the sign of the Jew. That He was the Son of God, because He could do this.

L-57 A woman touched His garment, run off out in the audience... This is to the newcomer. She run off out in the audience, 'cause she said in her heart, "If I can touch Him, I can be made well." Then when she did that, she felt satisfied she was going to be healed. Jesus said, "Who touched Me?" Why, they said, "Touch you?" The woman and all of them said, "No, not me." Everybody denied it, the Bible said. Well, said, "Somebody touched Me, 'cause I got weak." See? That's what causes weakness here. It's your faith. See? And He said, "I got weak. Virtue went from Me, or strength went from Me." Virtue is strength. Said, "Strength went 56-0429, Jehovah-Jireh, Abundant Life Center, Charlotte, NC, 100 min from Me; I got weak." So He kept looking around until He found the little woman. He set His eye on her. She had a blood issue. He said, "Your faith..." "Your faith, not no vision I saw, but your faith saved." Is that right? "Thy faith..." He didn't even know who she was or nothing about her. There was no vision. Just her faith touched Him. Said, "Thy faith has made you whole." If Jesus did that that day, He's got to do it today, if He's raised from the dead.

L-58 The Bible said He's the High Priest and can be touched by the feeling of our infirmities. Now, He's here in Spirit form. You can touch Him with your sickness. Now in closing... And may the Lord help you to believe it. If Jesus Christ will return. Now, He--He can't come here in a corporeal body. When His body comes from glory, every eye shall see Him, every knee shall bow, every tongue confess. Is that right? Now, all this isms going around. My poor little children, you be careful as you're waiting around. 'Cause they's everything in the world... Remember when all... In the last days the Bible said that the devil would go about like a roaring lion, lying wonders, deceiving. Is that right? And when all hell opened up, remember all heaven open up, too. See?

L-59 And the Bible said that Jambres and Jannes would raise up in the last days and almost deceive the very elect. Be careful, brother, and keep it right on the Word of God. Don't leave there. A whole lot of things today that's going on that's not coming from that Word. And you leave it alone. Stay with the Bible. 'Cause the Bible said it would deceive the very elect if possible. But when your name's wrote on the Lamb's Book of Life from the foundation of the world, you'll know His Voice. A stranger you'll not follow. I don't care if oils pouring out of hands, feet, and everything else. You'll know that don't come from the Bible, and you'll stay with God. Now, just watch. All kinds of wonders.

L-60 Now, remember if Jesus has raised from the dead, He's alive. And He's works through His Church. And He set some in the church what? First missionaries or apostles (both the same, "one sent"), second prophets, teachers, evangelists, pastors. Is that what the Bible said? He set five church offices. Missionaries, prophets, teachers, evangelists, pastors for the perfecting of the church. Then there's nine spiritual gifts that operate through the bod--the body. Now, one of them is the gift of knowledge, gift of wisdom, gift of tongues, gift of interpretation, and all those things, gift of prophecy. Now, there's a vast difference between the gift of prophecy and a prophet. A gift of prophecy goes from one to another. And before the church can even received it, it's got to be judged before three spiritual judges. And if it don't come to pass then it's wrong. You got the wrong spirit among you. Like speaking of tongues and interpretations... There's where you Pentecostal people's let down. I'm not your judge, but that's the Word. That's right. You went haywire on that. You better watch them things that they absolutely be done decently and in order and when the message goes, hear it.

L-61 Come down at the tabernacle one time. Watch how we operate it there. Them things has to be every word true. If it doesn't that person goes to the altar and get that evil spirit off of them. God don't lie. God tells the truth. See? Then you have the church in order. That's what we're going to teach when we get the tent. So we can get the big church and see if God can get to set together. All them gifts goes in the church, but the people just get them and just go anyway with them. Like Paul said, "People say you're crazy." That's what's hurt the Pentecostal church. Certainly. You've had the gifts but you--your pastor has failed to... Excuse me, brethren. I didn't mean that. I... Well, I... Yes, I did too. I'll not take it... I don't mean to hurt your feelings, I mean. See? But look. It's failed to set that church in the right order. That's right. That's what the church needs today. Let that church get in order and watch all the hell turn loose then. Yes, sir. It'll come together.

L-62 You know it was Solomon's first... temple of God was cut out all over the world, but when it come together, every stone went right to its place. See? The Chief Cornerstone, the rejected One, was to become the Chief of the corner. Now, all these spiritual gifts... Now, a gift of prophecy... A prophet is borned a prophet. A gift of prophecy is on one 56-0429, Jehovah-Jireh, Abundant Life Center, Charlotte, NC, 100 min and then the other, one and then the other. It's all... It's just in the church. And all nine spiritual gifts should be operating in every local body. Yeah, and there ought to be judges there and so forth and the church in order and working right.

L-63 But now a prophet... now look. Jeremiah... well, we just... so many. We take Moses, he was borned a prophet. Elijah, John the Baptist went right into the wilderness. See? A prophet... There's...?... Zechariah. God told Zechariah, said, "Before you was even formed in your mother's womb, I knew you, and sanctified you, and ordained you a prophet to the nation. Is that right? All the way up they had, THUS SAITH THE LORD, not... No judges standing before them. They had the Word of God. That's right. God in sundry times and divers manners spoke to the Fathers through the prophets. But to this last day through His Son, Jesus Christ, the resurrected One. Now, if He's standing here with these prophetic gift and all kinds of gifts operating in the church, you ought to believe Him. Will you do it?

L-64 Now, heavenly Father may You grant these blessings this afternoon to the people as we wait for the furthering of Your Spirit to bless us. We ask it in Christ's Name. Amen. Let's just all now being as I got off on teaching there, let's just sing together "Only Believe." Will you just once, to kindy come back now. I wonder while we're singing this... If Jesus will appear here this afternoon, the resurrected Jesus, will appear here this afternoon in His body of people and do the same things that He did back there when He was here on earth, will you believe it? Now look. Cleopas and them, after the resurrection they thought He was dead. He was walking with people that loved them. And many of you people love the Lord. But you fail to recognize that He's with you all the time. That's what's the matter with your healing today. You fail to recognize that He's right by you. Oh, I wish that I could get that through you. My, wished I could let it soak down on that side about five ribs deep. See? If you could only recognize...

L-65 Look at--look at Cleo--Cleopas and them. They was walking along and saying, "Well, I guess it's all over. He's dead. We seen Him killed. We seen the spear go through His heart and died the day before yesterday. And well, we might as well go back home. That's all. Yeah, got a story down there that these women said they saw Him. But 'course, we heard the report. The Jews come and stole Him away, took Him out. I wonder what's happened." A Stranger walked out and said, "Good morning, brethren." "Good morning, sir." Said, "What are you so sad about?" Said, "Are you a stranger and don't know that Jesus of Nazareth, Who we expected to be the King of Israel, has dead. This is the third day and so forth and..." "Why," He said, "Foolish of heart, slow to understand." Watch. The first thing He went was right straight to the Scripture. And that's where Jesus always hits us. When you see a man dodge from that Scripture, you dodge him. See? You stay right on that Scripture.

L-66 He went right straight to the Scriptures and begin with the prophets and begin to explain in the Old Testament, how that God was suppose to do, raise up Christ, and how He would die and raise the third day and so forth. And they didn't know it was Him. They walked all day with Him. So when they got to the place where they was going to go in, He acted like He was going to go on by. You know, that's the way He acts a lot of times. You think He's going to pass you right by. He ain't. Don't worry. He's not going to pass you by. So He just act like He was going to go by. "Oh," they said, "You must come and abide with us. The day's far spent. You must..." They constrained Him to come in. He said, "All right." When He's invited, He will come. So they go in, close the door. The little waitress come up and said, "What will you gentlemen have?" They ordered up the bread and stuff. And so she went back and brought out and set it down. They returned thanks. And 56-0429, Jehovah-Jireh, Abundant Life Center, Charlotte, NC, 100 min then Jesus done something the way He used to do it. And Cleopas looked at his friend, and his friend looked back to him. "Why," he said, "That's --that's the same way; that's the same way Jesus done it when..." He looked back and He was gone. You see. They didn't run back real quick to argue their religion. They run back to say, "The Lord's risen indeed."

L-67 Now, we're not here to argue somebody's theology. Whether they're Methodist, or Baptist, or Presbyterian, or baptize this way, that way, sprinkle. That's... Don't pay no attention to that. I'm here to say that Christ has risen from the dead. That's the main thing. And I hope it's not in vain. And I'm trying to help the sick people by it, to let them know that He died to heal them, as same as He died to save them. May He come and do it is my prayer. Only believe. All things are possible, if you can only believe. "Whatever you ask the Father in My Name, I'll do it." I've ask the Father in the Name of Jesus for His Son to come. And we... You yield yourself to Him. I'll yield myself to Him. He will speak to us this afternoon. The Lord bless you. All right.

L-68 Where's the prayer cards? Did you give out what... From what to what? They were given? E's? Let's find A... A, B, C, D, E. That's right. E's, my let's see; we been calling 1's and 50's and... Let's call something strange from it today then. Let's call from 75 today. Who has prayer card E-75? It's a little bitty thing like this, a little white card, got a number and a letter. E-75? Would you raise your hand. Maybe I got the wrong... was it E's. Oh, I'm sorry, sister. Come up here. Right here at the bottom of the steps. E-75, 76, 77, 78, 79. 79? All right. 80, 81, 82, 83, 84, 85, 86, 87, 88, 89, 90, 91, 92, 93, 94, 95, 96, 97, 98, 99, 100.

L-69 Now, be real reverent. I will not be responsible for critics or what happens. And I hope to see you again next year or whenever we can get the tent. I want to thank the Christian Businessmen for their fine co-operation, for the pastors, their fine co-operation, for the custodians here, and whatever, and for the ushers. They've done a fine job, for the sister, organist here, and the pianist. For every one of you for your tape recordings, for your help, for your support, for everything. God richly bless you is my prayer. And I pray that He will pay you a hundredfold. Remember. When you... If I can be of a favor to you, write to me. The night don't get too dark, and the rain don't fall too hard; I'll be praying for you. All right. While they trying to line up the prayer line here for those who has the prayer cards, let's start the prayer line to save time. Will you brethren go ahead and... All right bring up some of the people there.

L-70 How many here doesn't have a prayer card and wants Jesus to heal you? Let's see your hand. Pardon me. God bless you. My beloved friends, my most gallant people, do your realize what you done awhile ago when you put in that offering? You know what you did? You're helping me feed my children. If there's any left over that I don't... My expenses run me at home about a hundred dollars a day, my office and everything. Sending out anointed cloths, everything's free. And I'll assure you of this brother, sister. They'll not be one cent of it that'll go for the wrong thing. Best of my knowledge it'll go the mission fields there and help me preach the Gospel to the unsaved and the heathen of the land. Then not yet... The steward over that... It's out of your hands. It's in my hand now. Might have been a hundred dollars; it might have been three hundred dollars. I don't know what it was, if it was a thousand dollars. I don't know what it was. But ever what it is, it's up to me now. I'll answer for it from here out. And I want to be a good steward to the Lord. I'll use it to the best of my knowledge to His glory. Thank you and God bless you.

L-71 And now, I wonder do you know right off hand "Abide with me" without the music to it? That song, "Abide with me." Just kindly a little loud if you will so the crowd can come... That's right, sister. If you will come... I love that song. Let's get quietened down. It's in church. "Abide with me." O God. If ye abide in Me, My Words abide in you, ask what you will and it shall be done. Abide with me." Now, heavenly Father, be Thou with us, Lord. We realize that opposition stands close. Satan is raging. Unbelief is trying to settle in upon the people. Yet the Angels are at their position. They're standing ready. Even the black flags 56-0429, Jehovah-Jireh, Abundant Life Center, Charlotte, NC, 100 min will wave, or the white flags of heaven will wave in victory. God we ask it in Jesus' Name for the victory. Help us now. Forgive us of our sins. May we all meet at Thy home someday in peace. Until then help us as we go along encouraging others to believe. For we ask it in Christ's Name, the Son of God. Amen.

L-72 Now, if the--if the engineer will watch my voice. Just slowly if you will. [Brother Branham speaks to the organist--Ed.] Now, the lady here. First, all these people, I don't know them, you know that. I'm a stranger. I'm a stranger to you, I suppose. I don't know you. I never seen you, but yet God knows you. But if the Lord Jesus will reveal to me something that you have need of. Just like this, to the newcomers... This happen to come to my mind. Here's a typical picture now. I'm talking to the newcomers here firstly. Here's a picture today, a Bible time again.

L-73 The Lord Jesus went He went about, He was the prophet of Galilee, and they... He claimed He couldn't do nothing Hisself, but just as the Father would show Him. So one day He went up to Samaria. He had need to go up on His road to Jericho, went up over the mountain. Wonder why? Said the Father sent Him up there, of course. He set down on a well, and a woman come out to get some water. And He said... He sent His disciples away before that to get some food. And He said to the woman, "Bring Me a drink." Why would He do that? "Bring Me a drink." Maybe He's not thirsty. She said, "It's not customary for You Jews to ask Samaritans such as that." Said, "We have no dealings with each other." "That's right." Said, "But if you knowed Who you were talking to, you'd ask Me for a drink. And I'd bring you water you don't come here to draw." She said, "The well's deep, and You don't have nothing to draw with." He said, "But the water I give, is life bubbling up." Why, she said, "Our fathers worshipped in this mountain and you say at Jerusalem." He said, "Salvation is of the Jew, woman. We know that. We worship... We know what we worship. Salvation of the Jews. But the hour is coming when the Father don't--will not worship in this mountain, neither at Jerusalem, but in the Spirit and truth. And Father seeketh such." Is that Scriptural? And then what was He doing? Carrying this conversation with the woman, He was contacting her spirit.

L-74 The Father said, "Go up there." That's all He knowed to do. Father told me to come down here. That's all I knowed to do. Here's the woman. I don't know nothing about her. But what am I doing? Contacting her spirit, same thing He did. Now, Jesus said to the woman, "Go, get your husband." He found her trouble. Was that right. Said, "Go, get your husband." She said, "I don't have any husband." He said, "That's right. You got five." What did that Jew said when He told him of where he was. He said, "This is the sign of a Messiah. You're the Christ, the King of Israel." Watch this Samaritan now. What you going to say? Why, she said, "Sir, I perceive that You're a prophet." She said, "I know that when Messiah... We know (the Samaritans)--we know that when the Messiah cometh, He will tell us these things. But Who are You?" He said, "I'm He that speaks to you."

L-75 What was that the sign of? Newcomers? Messiah. Is that right? It was the sign of the Messiah to the Jew. It was the sign of the Messiah to the Samaritans. The same thing to the Gentile, when Peter went up. Jesus was sent only to the lost sheep of Israel. Now, if the Messiah is not in the grave, but alive today in His Church, it's still the sign of the Messiah. Is that right? In the house of Cornelius, when Peter went in and showed him about the vision he saw from the housetop, seen Cornelius and them. He seen them. That was the sign of the Messiah, the resurrection. 56-0429, Jehovah-Jireh, Abundant Life Center, Charlotte, NC, 100 min While Peter spoke these words the Holy Ghost fell on every one of them that heared. Ain't it too bad today that our hearts are so stony. We can't tender ourselves up? You know why? I seen something just like... If the Lord does... It happened one time in India, thousands. One time in Durban, South Africa, I seen twenty thousand raw heathens come to Christ at one time. I saw twenty five thousand people get healed at one time. They'd haul seven (the papers packed), seven loads, truck loads, of crutches, wheelchairs and things away from the grounds from one prayer.

L-76 But, oh, we got so much doctrine. "Doctor Jones says it's mental telepathy like the Jews did." The other one says it's a devil. "Don't have nothing to do with it. Poor people, we're the..." We need missionaries in America worst than all the world put together. It's a lot harder to deal with a educated heathen, than an uneducated one. Heathen means unbeliever. Now, the lady... Sister, of course, me not knowing you. Never seen you in my life. They'd have to be some way I'd... If God will tell me what you're here for or something just like He did through Jesus to the woman, will you accept Him? Will the audience re--accept Him with all your hearts? You believe you'll accept Him? If the... Watch here. The woman under oath as it would be (We don't believe in swearing.), put her hand up. We don't know one another, is that right, lady? Never met in our life. We don't know each other. Just... You been in my meetings? But you--you know I don't know you? That's what I meant. You see? We don't know one another. This is our first time meeting? All right then if something is revealed, it'll have to come through God.

L-77 Now, you could claim it telepathy, you can claim it the devil. Well, that would determine what you'd get out of it. You know the woman touched His garment, she got virtue. But the man who put a rag around His head, that Roman soldier, the soldiers, and criticized Him, and hit Him over the Head with a stick and said, "Tell me who hit you; we'll believe you now," they didn't feel no virtue. They didn't get nothing. Condemnation and went to hell for it, if they didn't repent. So that's just the truth. That's wrong. Now, if God will tell me what you're here for, you'll believe me to be His servant, the servant of the Lord Jesus Christ? But it's His Spirit Who's here doing the same thing He done in the Bible. Remember the whole audience claimed they would too. Now, you be the judge. See whether it's right or not. Let you judge it.

L-78 Now, the first thing the woman... I see her all upset about something. First... Yes, she's nervous. I see that. She's extremely nervous. Of course, that's the time of life that she's going through at the time. That's her age. Another thing, she has a growth, a growth on her back (That's right.), and one on your foot, too. That's right. If that's right, raise up your hand? You believe? Now, can I take the growth off? No, Jesus did that at Calvary. You believe it? Got some more trouble you're into, too, aren't you? It's a relative of yours. Yes. It's a domestic trouble like. It's about a marriage or divorcing and so forth. It's your nephew. Is that right? Now, do you believe me? All right. Go, receive what you ask for. The Lord Jesus make you...

L-79 Thanks be to God. Now, He's here. I don't know how you judge it. That's up to you. Christ... I've preached His Word. Christ is here to confirm His Word, to fulfill His Word. Now, it's up to you what your heart is. I shall continue with the prayer line. How do you, lady? I don't know you, lady. You know that. God only knows you as far--as far as I'm concerned. You may have lots of people know you, but I don't. But if God will tell me what you're trouble is, will you believe that it's Christ and not your brother standing here doing this? You will? You're suffering with some kind of something that stiffens you: arthritis. That's right. You got arthritis. If that's right raise your hand? And you got a growth, too. And that growth is in your throat. That's right, isn't it? Now, you believe? Then just walk off the platform like a young lady. Arthritis is gone from you. Go on, go eat your supper and do whatever you wish to. Let's say, "Thanks be to God."

L-80 How do you do, sir? We're strangers to each other, I suppose, sir. You're conscious that something's going on, aren't you? Yes, sir. The audience can see the expression of the people as they walk close. 56-0429, Jehovah-Jireh, Abundant Life Center, Charlotte, NC, 100 min How many seen that picture of the Angel of the Lord? Let's see your hand. That's what's right here by this brother now. That's right. You realize something is going on? Let's... It stands between us at this time, sir. We'll stand before It someday for judgment. I couldn't heal you if you're sick. You--you know Jesus did that. What He did, it's already paid for. We just have to believe it, accept it, have faith in it. Believe that God intended it for us. Which He did. But you're suffering with a... I see it looks like a blood or something. It's kinda... It's diabetes, sugar diabetes. That's right. Isn't it, sir? You believe me to be His servant? You do that, audience? Look on me just a minute, sir. You have a fine, a very fine spirit about you. I appreciate that. I've never seen you. I say this; you're not from this town. You're from about a hundred miles away from here. A place called King or something like that. That's right. And your initial is W. C. like Ceracy. That's right. That's right. That's right. You believe me now as God's prophet? Then go, be well. Jesus Christ makes you well.

L-81 You believe? Don't doubt. Have faith. If thou canst believe, all things are possible. You believe, lady? I believe you're telling the truth. All right. May the Lord bless you and help you. Now, the first thing, you're suffering with a trouble with your head, some kind of an injured nerve. You also got a bladder trouble, haven't you a bothering you? That's what your doctor told you anyhow. That's right. You believe you're healed? Then go and believe it with all your heart. And may the Lord bless you. God bless you. Amen. Praise the Lord. Oh, if this didn't weaken me so... Just have faith. Audience, are you conscious what's going on? Do you realize that somewhere in the supernatural realm here stands the resurrected Christ? He's out there too. Do you believe it? Look this a way and tell Him you do. Anywhere in the building just look and say, "God, I believe it."

L-82 What's you praying about, little lady, setting on the end of the... You believe me to be His prophet? You want to get over that nervous spell, don't you, you have? If that's right stand on your feet. The little lady right down on the end of... this little old elderly lady standing here. That's right. You were setting there praying, because you had a nervous condition don't you? It's a mental disturbance. You're always upset, isn't that right? If that's right, wave your hand like that? Now, right now you don't feel it do you? It's gone from you. You're healed. Your faith has healed you. Now, you can go home a well woman glorifying God.

L-83 Look, sister. Don't weep; believe. Do you believe me to be His prophet or His servant? I couldn't heal you, you know, if I had to. But if God will reveal to me your trouble, will you--will you accept it? Your trouble is that you're real weak. That's right. You've lost a lot of weight. I see you a bigger woman than what you really are now. Why? You just come from a hospital. You had an experience in the hospital, and you're so weak you can't hold yourself up. That's right isn't it? THUS SAITH THE LORD. If that's right stand on your feet? Now, your weaknesses leave you. You can go home and be a well woman. Your faith's made you well. Amen. Have faith in God. If thou canst believe...

L-84 Are you the patient or the person? You believe? You believe what I preached about Jesus Christ being the Son of God? Is that right, lady? You are a believer. How do I know? You could be a critic, but your spirit is welcome. You're a believer. I'm just your brother. I never seen you in my life. But now, if you're needing healing, I couldn't do it, you know that? If you're needing forgiveness for something, unless you've sinned against me... I could forgive you if you sinned against me, but God has to forgive you. But your life, you couldn't hide it now, 'cause you're already in contact. Amen. It's wonderful. You're a nervous person, too, really all upset, weary. Then you got a--a rupture, too. That's right, isn't it? You believe me to be His prophet? You got more trouble than that, sister. It's a son you're praying about. The son is mentally retarded, your boy. And you're praying about him. You're not from here either. A place called Green Mill. That's right, isn't it? Take that handkerchief that you wiped your tears with; lay it on the child. He will be free.

L-85 Yes, sister, you with the black gloves on and your hands like this. Raise up look this way at me. If I don't quote to 56-0429, Jehovah-Jireh, Abundant Life Center, Charlotte, NC, 100 min you your prayer, that you were praying, that I heard in another dimension, another world, tell you what you're praying about, will you believe that Jesus heard you? And His... This is His anointing? Who hears prayer? Christ. You were praying for a bladder condition. And you were praying for a colon condition, and asking God to have me to speak to you. Is that right? If it is, I want you to stand up to your feet just a minute so the people will know. Turn around to the audience. Do you believe? Don't fear, sister. You're going to be well. Why do I say that? It turns white, a light around you. First it was a dark shadow. Then that light come down and you accepted it. That same angel that was over there, it went away. Now, go believing. Don't doubt, 'cause he will try to come back. And the last estate will be seven times worse. But you believe what you're told. If He knows what your past was, surely He knows what your future will be. And look. Another thing, that deep walk with God you're seeking. That's right. It's true. You going to receive that now. Amen. Not reading your mind, just telling you what your desire is and what your prayer is.

L-86 How do you do, lady. What do you think about all this? Do you believe it's the Son of God, not your brother? You know that. My how could I do those things? I have no... Sister, have faith. Now, I can't heal you, but believe. You raised up awhile ago, got the wrong person. It was a little lady setting here in front. But you wanted... You was nervous; that kept causing it. But your trouble comes from your back. That's right, isn't it, honey? The little girl there. Raise your hand up if that's right. See? You stepped up, just a little ahead. That's all right I seen what was wrong with you. Lay your hand over on the lady next to you, 'cause she's got arthritis. She wants to be prayed for. Isn't that right, lady? The elderly lady, raise up your hand. You believe me to be His servant now? Have faith and believe. I see you having something around your arm. Oh, it's a blood pressure thing. And he says your blood's low. That's right isn't it? Let me tell something else that might encourage you. Low blood pressure is worse than high. We realize that, especially at your weight. But I want to ask you something else. Let me tell you something so you'll that know that Jesus Christ is here. You got somebody else you was praying for. That's your daddy. He isn't here. But he's got a bad hip. That's right, isn't it? Now, go and take that handkerchief you wiped your tears from. You receive what you ask for.

L-87 Come, lady. You know God can heal diabetes, do you believe that? All right, go tell Him, thank Him. Tell Him, "Thank the Lord." Believe Him now. Come, lady. Do you believe me, sister? You're mighty young to have that kind of a condition. It's a female condition, a lady's trouble. That is right, isn't it? You believe He heals you? You're feeling something now you've never had before. Isn't that right? Now, go believing. It'll come to pass. If thou canst believe. Sister, God... You got one of the worst diseases there is. Heart trouble. But God can heal heart trouble, can't He? You believe it? You believe it? All right, then go and receive it, and be made well with all your heart. How you do, lady? Now listen, arthritis is bad. The doctors have nothing for it, but Jesus has. Do you accept it? Go, walking across the platform; receive your healing in the Name of the Lord Jesus.

L-88 Come, lady. Do you believe with all your heart? You believe that Jesus Christ is here to make you well? All right. The female trouble has left you. I want to tell you something. That had a drainage to it too, didn't it? All right. Go, rejoicing, happy. Thanking the Lord for His...?... God bless you. Seen you slip there. Satan tried to upset you. But you know what did it? It was just a little something sort of strange. Because the woman just past by here was healed with heart trouble, the same thing you had and was healed. That's caused, 'caused he tried to throw you off there and hurt you. But he failed. You're healed. That's right. You're lady's condition, the main thing you're nervous. In a lady's condition, and a female trouble causes that. You believe you're--you're healed? Then go and receive Him in the Name of the Lord Jesus.

L-89 Have faith. Lady, what's a kidney trouble or back trouble to God? You believe He will make you well? Then go and receive it in Jesus Name. Do you believe? Huh? Wait a minute. Do you believe? What about it out there? Has He raised from the dead? Do you believe your wayward daughter will come home and be saved, lady? You're praying for your daughter, aren't 56-0429, Jehovah-Jireh, Abundant Life Center, Charlotte, NC, 100 min you? Yes. Lay your hand on that baby next to you; she's got bronchial trouble in her bronchial tubes. Isn't that right, lady? Have faith in God. What about you right behind her? You got spine trouble, haven't you, lady? The little... Stand upon your feet there a little white there. Put your hand on the lady next to you. She's got arthritis, and she wants to be healed. Stand upon your feet. Believe. That's all. It's all over now. You're healed. How about the rest of you? Do you believe? Do you believe He's here? Has He raised from the dead? Do you want the Holy Ghost? This is It. You can receive it. Stand on your feet and give Him the praise and you shall receive everything... Courtesy of Living Word Broadcast P. O.
