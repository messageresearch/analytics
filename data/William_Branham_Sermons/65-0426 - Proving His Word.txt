--- TRANSCRIPT ---

L-1 Let us bow our heads just a moment. Dear Heavenly Father, we are grateful that we are here tonight. We, we are grateful that we know Your Presence is here with us. Now we pray that You'll minister to each one of us, as we have need. We ask it in Jesus' Name. Amen. (You be seated.)

L-2 Just feels good to have these microphones alive. I was so sorry to kind of mess that up yesterday, the Message that I wanted you to get so bad.

L-3 And I wanted you to be sure to see that. It's the--the anchor that we have. We are not anchored by a church. We're anchored in Christ, you see. He is that only Way. He is the only place of safety, the only place that God ever put His Name. And God said He would meet the people in the place He chose to put His Name; not in any gate, but in the gate that He chose. And in that place He would meet the people, and there only. And we find out that God never put His Name anywhere but in His Son, Jesus Christ, as the son always takes the name of the father.

L-4 And now you say, "Well, what does that apply today? Each one says, 'I'm in Jesus.'"

L-5 He is the Word. That, "In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God. The Word was made flesh and dwelt among us." Again, it's also written in Revelation the 19th chapter, when we see Him Coming, the Bride and Groom, His vesture dipped in Blood, "His Name was called 'The Word of God.'" He is the Word of God. [John 1:1]

L-6 And, that's, He is the quickening power. He is the Holy Spirit is that, the--the dynamics that comes into the mechanics, the Words, that make it live. And it all has to work together, or it just won't work. It's got to take the whole Bible, the whole Christ, the full Gospel.

L-7 I want to say, to this panel that I watched on television last night, knowing it was going to be on, and I watched it. I want to comment these brethren, the ones that was on that panel, such a masterly piece of answering questions! And I'm a very much of a critic, you know, anyhow, but there wasn't nothing to criticize there. It was absolutely genuine, and I could agree with that, one hundred percent. [Congregation applauds--Ed.] Thank you. Amen. Them answers was right to the point. I certainly did appreciate that. I only wish I had a film to show in my church at home. It was really nice.

L-8 And I'm so thankful to know that--that God has dealt out in the other realms, besides our own Pentecostal group, and are picking up men, those seed of God, that's been laying out there all these years, waiting for the Light to shine across them.

L-9 And it also gives us a warning, friends, to know that Jesus said, "When this sleeping virgin had begin to come in to buy Oil, that was when the Bridegroom was coming." So we can see by that, when we see the Episcopalian, Presbyterian, Methodist, Baptist, Lutheran, coming in to get the Oil, then that was the hour that the Bridegroom came. Let's remember that. [Matthew 25:10]

L-10 I never had Billy, my son, to say such to me as he did just a few moments ago. He said, "Daddy, I don't tell you what to do. I don't mean to impress you by anything, but," said, "daddy, whatever you do, put all your time for them sick people." He said, "I never seen so many sick people!" Said, "I gave out two hundred cards in just a moment or two." Said, "There is so many people sick!" He does very seldom ever tells me that.

L-11 And then I come tonight with some little notes wrote down here, and some comments upon the oncoming judgment, and knowing that we're sitting here tonight with the very wrath of God jerking beneath us, and soon she'll swipe it up. And knowing that the wrath of God is waiting; just at the moment it will be said, it will be over, for millions. And knowing that in my heart, and knowing it to be so! And then we see so many sick, pressing and pulling.

L-12 And I thought, "Tonight, most of them are Christians." And let me say to this, you children of God. Whatever you 65-0426, Proving His Word, Embassy Hotel, Los Angeles, CA, 123 min do, you let everything else go. You serve God, day and night, with all your heart. You, you can feel there is something wrong. You can tell it as you walk in the streets, you just... and wherever you go. You know, if you're spiritual; and I know you are.

L-13 And I was talking to a man, Brother Stromei. I don't know whether Tony is here, or not. He, he was... [A brother says, "Tony Salameh?"--Ed.] Tony Salameh, Salameh, Salameh? No. I got the wrong Tony. [A brother says something.] No, that's the wrong Tony. This is the Tony of--of--of Tucson. What is his name? [Someone else says, "Stromei."] Stromei! I know it's Salameh, Stromei, or some. I get all...

L-14 In his store, the other day, was a man came in, was very striking, he was saying something that brought back a memory to me, when I... last time I was in--in India.

L-15 Where, I think the Lord gave us the greatest crowd we ever had at one time, was in Bombay. We couldn't even find places nowhere to put them, tens of thousands and thousands of people.

L-16 And just before we got there, there was a newspaper translated. Well, it was, India is a bilingual country, it was--it was the English paper. And said, "Well, the earthquakes must be over, the birds are flying back to their home in their nests."

L-17 A few days before the earthquakes come, that tore down the fences and things. The little birds find themselves shelters in the rocks, and build their nests; and in the afternoon or in midday, when the sun is real hot, all the animals stand around those rock walls, to get in the shade. And for two days, the birds stayed out in the trees, they wouldn't come to their nests; and two days, the animals, the sheep and cattle, they would not come around in the afternoon, or hang around those walls. They--they stayed out in the field and leaned against each other, for shade.

L-18 Then all at once, an earthquake, that just shook the walls and tore down the buildings. And, see, if those little birds had been in there, they'd have perished. If the cattle had been standing beneath it, and the sheep, they'd have perished. God warning nature!

L-19 A few days ago, down in Brother Tony's store, I was listening to a man there that said... When this earthquake taken place in Alaska, he was fishing down in what we call Stony Point, at Mexico. And he said, "The birds wouldn't feed, and the fish wouldn't feed. There was something wrong. And, all at once, the earthquake broke loose."

L-20 And the other day, when that one happened over in India, or wherever it was, he said he was fishing again. He thought, "Well, it's strange. Those fish feed about this time. There is not a roll in the water, nowhere. The water is just as quiet, perfect time for the fish to feed, but they didn't feed. And all the birds that's usually out there, the gulls, picking up these fish and things, was all walking around on the bank, huddling one against another. In a few moments, the sea moss from the bottom begin to come up like that, an earthquake had happened across the other side of the earth." See, them fish knowed there was something wrong, something was fixing to happen. Those birds knew the same.

L-21 Surely, if God gives a fish and a bird discernment, how much more should He give His--His children! We know that we're at the end time, and judgment is waiting, so let's be real reverent. Flee to God with all your heart! "O Capernaum, thou who art exalted into heaven, will be brought down into hell," and today she lays beneath the bed of the waters. Just remember, and pray. [Matthew 11:23]

L-22 Now, tonight, I want to read a place here in the Scripture, just for a few moments. We're going to pray for the sick. Billy said he give out a bunch of prayer cards. And he gave out some yesterday, and I never got to any of them last night. And I wondered, when the Holy Spirit came... It's just... You can't make It work. It's just like a little lever, you pull yourself into a gear. You're the one does that operating of the Holy Spirit, not me. You do that yourself. So I, last night, I noticed even in discernment, it never picked up with the people just right. They didn't seem to take to it. I have found it, here lately, it seems like, more or less, just as I was speaking, laying hands upon the sick, they know.

L-23 We should realize that in us has been given, we who believe Jesus Christ and been born of His Spirit and filled with that quickening power, that power that's in you. By laying on hands, on the others, like the disciples did and down through the age, It absolutely healed the sick, raised the dead, It showed visions, prophecies. And the very same Spirit 65-0426, Proving His Word, Embassy Hotel, Los Angeles, CA, 123 min that lived amongst the early apostles is living in the church today, working the very same things. And as quick as we can recognize that! See, no matter how much it's a working, you've got to recognize that and believe that. It won't do one bit of good, until you do believe it. But the moment you believe it, your troubles are ended. That's true. [Ephesians 2:1]

L-24 Now let us turn in the Scripture. I was sitting out there, a few moments ago, jotted down a few more Scriptures, to change my text for the night. And I want to read some out of the Word of God, out of the Book of Saint Luke, the 8th chapter, beginning with the 40th verse. Listen now, I'm going to read extensive. And it came to pass, that, when Jesus was returned, the people gladly received him: for they were all waiting for him. Would not that be a fine attitude for the company tonight? And, behold, there came a man named Jairus, and he was a ruler of the synagogue: and he fell down at Jesus' feet, and besought him that he would come into his house: For he had one only daughter, about twelve years of age, and she lay a dying. But as he went the people thronged him. And a woman having an issue of blood twelve years, which had spent all her living upon physicians, neither could be healed of any, Came behind him, and touched the border of his garment: and immediately her issue of blood stanched. And Jesus said, Who touched me? When all denied, Peter and they that were with him said, Master, the multitude throng thee and press thee, and sayest thou, Who touched me? ... Jesus said, Somebody has touched me: for I perceive that virtue is gone out of me. And when the woman saw that she was not hid, she came trembling, and fell down before him, and declared unto him before all the people for what cause she had touched him, and how she was healed immediately. And he said unto her, Daughter, be of good comfort: thy faith has made thee whole; go in peace. And while he... spake, there certain one came from the ruler of the synagogue's house, saying to him, Thy daughter is dead; trouble not the Master. But when Jesus heard it, he answered him, saying, Fear not: believe only, and she shall be made whole. And when he was come into the house, he suffered no man to go in, save Peter,... James, and John, and the father and the mother of the maiden. And all wept,... bewailed her: and he said, Weep not; she is not dead, but asleep. And they laughed him to scorn, knowing that she was dead. But he put them all out, and took her by the hand, and called the maid, saying, Maid, arise. And her spirit came again, and she rose straightway: and he commanded to give her meat. And her parents was astonished: but he charged them that they should tell no man what was done. [Luke 8:40-56]

L-25 Now let us pray. Dear Heavenly Father, as we read this Word, we know that that is truth. This happened. It's not some mythical story that we would read out of maybe a newspaper or some book of fiction, but this come from the Book that we know to be the Word of God. We believe it happened. We believe that this Jesus that did this notable thing, two instances here, of the woman with the blood issue, and the dead child, we believe that He is God's Son, that God raised Him up from the dead and has presented Him to us, tonight, in the person of the Holy Ghost.

L-26 And we believe that He is here with us tonight. And believing that He is the same yesterday, today, and forever, His compassions reach out to the people. And as the people reach for Him, the same results that was given in that day will be given this day. Grant it again, Father, that we might have a fresh anointing. As Brother Shakarian asked so sincerely, a while ago, and asked the audience to believe, we are asking again in the Name of Jesus Christ. Amen.

L-27 I want to speak just for a few moments, and that will be just a few moments, 'cause I want to get them people with the prayer cards up here and pray for them. And omitting any other thing but just praying for the sick. But before we pray for the sick, we've got to get the people in that attitude. It's the attitude that always brings the results. It's the 65-0426, Proving His Word, Embassy Hotel, Los Angeles, CA, 123 min attitude that you take towards God.

L-28 Here is a woman touched His garment, she was healed, with a blood issue. A soldier spit in His face and put a crown of thorns on His head, and felt no virtue. [Matthew 9:21]

L-29 It's your approach. The attitude is what it takes. And that's what it is tonight, dear friend, it takes the attitude. We are, and believe that we are, in the Presence of Jesus Christ, but it's your attitude that brings the results. The mechanics is here, and so is the dynamics. If you can just get started, God will do the rest.

L-30 Now, this subject that I want to speak on, for a few moments, is: Proving His Word. Now that's a great thing, to think of that: Proving His Word.

L-31 Now God is just as able to prove His Word, tonight, as He ever did prove It. And the Bible also said, "Prove all things. Hold fast to that what's good." [I Thessalonians 5:21]

L-32 Now you've heard, no doubt, heard the old proverb, "Prove it, I'll believe it." But that doesn't hold true. Many times I seen many things proved, that was absolutely scientificially even proved, and yet people didn't believe it anyhow.

L-33 I was talking with a man, here not long ago. We was talking about Divine healing. He said, "I wouldn't believe it. I don't care what would happen, how much proof you could show of it, I still don't believe it." Well, certainly, no matter what you'd ever do for that man, he--he's lost. He cannot believe. There is nothing in him, to believe.

L-34 I just had a--a little experience here, about a week ago, as you all know that I--I hunt. And when I come back from my meeting, I been lion hunting. And after I moved into Arizona, it's good, I like to hunt big game, and I like to get out amongst nature and watch it.

L-35 Now, I'm not a killer. I just hunt. So, I--I don't like to destroy game, I--I don't think it's right. I think it's just as much sin to kill game, when you're not using it and going to use it for a purpose, as it would be to kill anything else. I believe it's wrong. We shouldn't do that. God gave it to us for food and for purposes, and we should not destroy it. But now what the law says you can take, all right. Just don't waste it.

L-36 And I down there, the season is out for everything else. Lions kill a lot of cattle. And I know a lot of ranchers up in the country. And every time they get a kill, why, they call me, when a lion gets amongst sheep. A certain friend of mine, the other night, lost about thirty-five hundred dollars, in one night, by one lion killing just lambs. He got in, and, course, the rest of the lions are going to have to pay for his sin. And so I got the lion, and so it was a great big lion, and nine-foot long, and weighed close two-something, so it was--it was a good big lion.

L-37 And then I went from the country of Arizona, up into Utah, to hunt. And so I was told that there was people up there, that a man that I was going to hunt with, was a government trapper, "And, for goodness sakes, don't mention anything about religion, around him." Said, "He was really a rough fellow."

L-38 And I said, well, I told the man I was going with, I said, "I won't mention it."

L-39 He said, "Don't say 'preacher.' If you do, you'll never get to go hunting. He wouldn't take you." Said, "I hunted with him three days, and slept with him every night, eat with him every day, and he never even said, 'Good morning. How do you do? You want something to eat? Wash the dishes.' Nothing!" Said, "Now just don't say nothing about it."

L-40 I said, "I won't say a word." So I didn't tell him I wouldn't pray, but I just kept on tell him that I'm... And I pray.

L-41 So when we got up there, the man was a very hard character, and I didn't think he believed anything. And he had just lost a baby a few nights before that, a stillborn baby. So, we went hunting. And on the second day, the man I was hunting with had told him, said I get to hunt everywhere around the country. So when the other hunter, was with me, had left, we were way in top of peaks; where we just run a lion, till we got him into the rocks, and he had got away. And so we were sitting there waiting for the dog to return. And this man said to me, he said, "The other hunter, your friend, tells me that you get to hunt everywhere. You got plenty of money?" Said, "I guess it's none of my business."

L-42 And I said, "No," I said, "it isn't plenty of money." I said, "I--I'm sponsored." And he said, "Oh, I see." He said, "Well, I guess it's none of my business again, but," said, "are you with a firm that 65-0426, Proving His Word, Embassy Hotel, Los Angeles, CA, 123 min sponsors you?"

L-43 He was pulling it right out of me. I promised I wouldn't, see. So I said, yeah, I said, "No, sir. I'm a preacher, a missionary." He said, "A what?" I said, "Missionary." And he just stood and looked at me for a few minutes.

L-44 I said, "Do you have any hope for Life hereafter? What is your hope?" He said, "I'm a Jack Mormon." And I said, "A what?" He said, "A Jack Mormon." I said, "What kind is that?"

L-45 Said, "The one that swears and drinks coffee, and smokes cigarettes." I said, "Well, an honest confession is good for the soul."

L-46 And then he said--he said, "I want to ask you something." He said, "I am told that the Mormon church is the only true church there is." He said, "Do you believe that?"

L-47 I said, "When it comes to church, I guess it's as good as any of them. I only know one Truth, and that's Jesus Christ." I said, "I know He is True."

L-48 "Well," he said, "I had a baby born the other night, stillborn." He said, "I am told that this baby, because it was stillborn, God never did breathe the breath of life into it, that I'll never see it again." He said, "What do you think about that?"

L-49 "Well," I said, "You won't as a Jack Mormon, you sure won't. That's one thing sure, you won't see it as long as you stay a Jack Mormon." And he said... Well, he had been pushing me, so I push him back a little bit, you see. We had--had time to push back. So he said--he said... I said, "What's the matter?" He said, "Oh, I don't know." And he said, "Well, what do you think?" I said, "I am acquainted with many fine..."

L-50 I didn't know he was a Mormon. And I was a very... I know, being it in Utah, it probably was, but I... 'cause most the people up there are Mormon, around Salt Lake City. This wasn't Salt Lake City, however. So I thought, "Well, I've had some fine Mormon friends, been in the prayer lines, fine people."

L-51 And I said, "I have met some very fine man who are--are Mormons." And he said, well, he said... I said, "I don't know their teaching on that, and I wouldn't want to say something contrary to their teaching, because that's what you are, and I respect that highly." And I said, "Well, and you believe that?" He said, "Yes, sir, I do. But," said, "I don't live to it."

L-52 I said, "Well, I believe that the Bible teaches that God knew that baby, millions of years ago, before the foundation of the world." I said, "God told Jeremiah, 'Before you was ever conceived in your mother's womb, before you ever was come forth from the belly, I knew you, sanctified you, and ordained you a prophet to the nations.'" I said, "That's how much He knew about it, see." He said, "Well," he said, "thank you." [Jeremiah 1:5]

L-53 He started walking down the hill. And then he met with this other fellow, and he said, "Why didn't you tell me that guy was a preacher?" And so we... He talked to him a little bit and begin to tell him about the meetings.

L-54 Now, Mormons believe prophecy. I don't... might not be any here, but they--but they do believe in--in prophecy. But, so, maybe I'm talking out of school, but I... Yeah. Yeah. But, however, they believe.

L-55 And he say, he come back to me, said, "I understand that you are a prophet." I said, "No, sir." I said, "I... The Lord has showed me a few things to happen."

L-56 And he took off, right away, said, "Let's go in." And he got in his car, and went down to the... There was a little city from where he lived. In a few moments, he was missing. We was fixing the dogs, to take another hunt right after 65-0426, Proving His Word, Embassy Hotel, Los Angeles, CA, 123 min lunch. And when we did, why, he took off in a car.

L-57 In a few moments, a fine-looking young man come back, about seventeen years old, a real saintly-looking Christian gentleman. He said, "This is my brother." Said, "He is not a Jack Mormon. He is a real Mormon." I said, "How do you do, son?"

L-58 And he said, "I understand, that my brother tells me, that you are a prophet." I said, "No, sir." I said, "It isn't that I am a prophet." I said, "The Lord has showed me things to come to pass."

L-59 He said, "I have a shot in my arm right now, I'm supposed to be on the operating table." He said, "But my brother told me this. And I said, 'If that's so, I don't need the operation.'" He looked me right straight in the eye, an honest, true, sincere look, said, "You lay your hands upon me. If these things are so, I won't need the operation." He went home well.

L-60 This brother, Christian friend of mine, was hunting with me, from Phoenix. He said to me, he said... Some of these boys are sitting right here now. One of them I know is here present. We went home. He said, "Brother Branham, if the Lord would show you a vision and let you tell them Mormons just what's going to happen, that will do it, because they are looking for it."

L-61 So, I prayed and I prayed. And on my road back home, I was coming up, on the following Monday, Sunday, about ten o'clock, I was standing in the room, after church that morning, and was looking out.

L-62 And I saw flashlights flashing, or some kind of a light flashing. And I saw a lion that was in a tree, and--and it was too small for me to shoot. I didn't want it. And there was someone else shot it, and, when they did, they shot it with too big a gun. It blowed the lion up. I didn't appreciate the--the--the way it was done.

L-63 When I got up to Phoenix, I told Brother Dawson that, and Brother Mosley. I know he is here. I seen him the other day, somewhere here. And he was going up with me, he and his wife. And I said, "You watch and see, that's THUS SAITH THE LORD. It's going to happen that way."

L-64 Nights we waited, four or five nights, we had hunted, or days. Seldom you ever tree a lion at night. Happened to be, coming home, they turned the dogs loose, this hunter, this Mormon boy. And the--the lion struck a trail, or the dog struck the trail of the lion, rather, and run him up in a tree. And at ten o'clock at night they come, got us out of bed. We went out there, and there was that same lion in the tree. Flashing the lights, Brother Mosley shot him with about a forty-four caliber, liked to have blowed the lion half in two. And there it was, just exactly the way it was said.

L-65 The next day, I met the chief game warden of the state, another Jack Mormon. Took those boys together, leading them back home to Christ.

L-66 I tell you, He's the same yesterday, today, and forever. God proves His Word to be so.

L-67 You've heard people say, "Seeing is believing." That's not altogether true. Many people see and they still don't believe.

L-68 The days that Jesus was on earth, why didn't they recognize Him, that He was that Word of God made manifest? Why didn't the people realize that Moses said, "The Lord your God shall rise up a prophet likened unto me"? And He fulfilled every Word that the Bible spoke that He would do, but they didn't believe it. [Deuteronomy 18:15-18], [Acts 3:22], [Acts 7:37]

L-69 But God, in every age, has proved His Word to be true. He always proves His Word. Then they say sometimes, that, "Seeing is believing." It isn't so. But we know that God goes right on proving His Word in every age.

L-70 We know that He proved it to Adam and Eve, that when He said, "The day you eat thereof, that day you shall surely die." We have to admit to that, that that's truth. We believe that, for He has proved it to us, and we know that it's the truth. [Genesis 2:17]

L-71 Now we'll just take some places that God did prove His Word. Let's take, for instance, in the days of--of Noah. God spoke to Noah a message that certainly was unscientific and unbelievable. No one could have believed. It had never rained upon the earth. Unscientific! [Hebrews 11:7], [Genesis 6:14, 22] 65-0426, Proving His Word, Embassy Hotel, Los Angeles, CA, 123 min

L-72 Perhaps they were a greater scientific age then than we are now, because they built pyramids and sphinxes, and so forth, in those days, that we can't build now. They was acquainted with a power, of some kind of a mechanical power, perhaps atomic or something, that they could lift those big boulders, that we couldn't do it today. But they did great scientific things. They had something they could embalm a body, to make it look natural for hundreds of years. We've lost that art.

L-73 Jesus said, "As it was in the days of Noah, so shall it be at the coming of the Son of man." And we know that we are to enter into another great scientific age. [Luke 17:26]

L-74 And now the message that Noah had was very much contrary to the belief of that day, in the church, and it was also very much contrary to the scientific research. But God proved His Word to be the truth. God proved that what that prophet said was the truth. [Hebrews 11:7]

L-75 Also we'll take another for just a moment. Abraham was another prophet of the Lord, that the Word came to. And told him, when he was seventy-five years old, and Sarah was sixty-five years old, that he was going to have a child by Sarah. Now, that was quite a shock to an unbeliever. Could you imagine, today, such a thing happening even in this day, with all of our scientific achievements, and all these test-tube babies they talk about, and so forth? But this old woman, now of sixty-five years old, and an old man of seventy-five years old, but the Word of the Lord came to Abraham and told him that this was going to happen. And Abraham believed God. Now, no matter how much God spoke, and how true it was, Abraham had to believe what God said, to make it so. Now look how that man was tested, with his testimony, that he did believe. [Hebrews 11:8-11], [Genesis 21:1-7]

L-76 That same man that made that confession, that he believed God, he's a person like you are, sitting here tonight. We still believe God. We got to believe His Word is the Truth. And He'll prove it, that It's the Truth, if we'll just believe it.

L-77 Now look at the hindrance that Abraham had. First thing was his age, seventy-five years old, and Sarah being sixty-five. She was way past the change of life, the menopause. No doubt but what it stopped, many years before. He had lived with her as a wife. It was his half sister, had probably taken her when she was just a girl in her teens, and had married her. And he had had no children. She was absolutely barren. And now we find that, to do this, he had to separate himself from all of the peoples who did not believe it, in order to make it come to pass. [Genesis 21:1-7]

L-78 I don't mean to say you have to separate yourself from peoples. But you have to separate yourself from all the gossip of unbelief, and stay away from that. When people says, "Ah, those things don't happen! That's a bunch of lunatic people! There is no such a thing as that happening," just close up your ears and walk away. Don't pay any attention to it.

L-79 The Bible said that "Abraham staggered not at the promise of God, through unbelief; but was strong, giving praise to God." His name was changed from Abram to Abraham, the changing of the name made his name, "father of nations." Could you imagine a man living with his wife, his sweetheart, that he had lived with her now for all these years, and now somewhere in the age of eighty years old, and his wife seventy years old, and yet without one child or any hope of child, yet claimed that he was the "father of nation." Could you imagine the criticism of his passing fellow man would say, "Father of nations, now how many children do you have at this time?" And all the criticism he had to go through with! [Romans 4:20]

L-80 But Abraham didn't stagger anywhere at all, of unbelief. He believed that God was able to perform that which He had promised, that God would prove His Word, no matter how long it took. But instead of getting weaker each time, like we are prone to do, he got stronger all the time. "If it didn't happen today, tomorrow it will be a greater miracle, 'cause it's one day older." That was God, that was God in Abraham, for he knowed that God proved all of His Words to be so. [Romans 4:20]

L-81 If His children will only take His Word, so He can prove It by you! That's the only way He can prove His Word.

L-82 He doesn't prove It to unbelievers. They can't be proved; they are unbelievers. But, It's not to unbelievers. It's not for unbelievers. 65-0426, Proving His Word, Embassy Hotel, Los Angeles, CA, 123 min

L-83 It's to him that believe. And if He can find somebody who will believe His Word, He will prove His Word by you. And sometimes sickness and things happen to us that way, that God can prove Himself.

L-84 Do you remember the blind man that Jesus found? They said, "Who sinned, he or his father, his mother?" [John 9:2-3]

L-85 He said, "In this case, neither, but that the works of God might be made known." See, it happened to the boy so that Jesus could be glorified. Sometimes sickness is not a curse, it's a blessing, that we can stick our faith out there and call those things which are not, as though they were. God said so, and He'll prove it's so if you'll just not weaken under the test. [John 9:4]

L-86 He could prove Job, one time, that he wouldn't curse Him to His face. Look at the trial that Job went through. But down in the very jaws of death, he yet said, "The Lord gave, the Lord taken away, blessed be the Name of the Lord!" He certainly believed it. God proved His Word to Job. He proved it to Abraham. He proved it so. [Job 1:21]

L-87 Also He proved it by Moses. And when Moses, when the difficulty was so against him, Moses had it in his mind, that perhaps, to be a deliverer, that his mother had probably told him he was born a proper child. She--she was his tutor that raised him up in Pharaoh's palace, no doubt had told him, "Son, we have prayed that we'd be delivered, and we believe that you are that child that God will use to deliver." And then when he... [Hebrews 11:23]

L-88 See, he come up and was to be the--the son of Pharaoh's daughter, and we find out that he was to be heir to the throne. Why, no doubt it was in their mind then, that he would become the next Pharaoh, "And that's how he would deliver the people, by being the next Pharaoh." But God had a... If that would have been so, then he would have done it through a material, through a--a--a act of politics. But God doesn't always work like that.

L-89 God has His own ways to work, and He said He would "bring them out." He told Abraham, "After four hundred years," He would "bring them out, with a mighty hand," He would "show signs and wonders." So he couldn't do it like that, so Abra-... We find out that Abraham believed God, and here is Moses now believing God. [Genesis 15:13-14]

L-90 And Moses looked out of the same window that Pharaoh did, he saw the same people. That Pharaoh looked out upon them, as, "A cursed people, a people that had nothing but a bunch of fanaticism, for a God, and some desert God somewhere that they knowed nothing about; some unseen post that they pray to, that there wasn't nothing to it. They're a bunch of fanatics. And they were a bunch of slaves. And their God letting them be slaves, proved that He wasn't God."

L-91 And right in the midst of the whole thing, He was raising up the very man. God does things in such peculiar ways, right up under them. Not a theologian, not a teacher, not a priest, not one of their holy men; but just an ordinary man, born for the job. And God called him to be His prophet, and sent him down there. And nothing in his hand but a crooked stick, to face an army, mechanized units that had conquered the whole world. But with that stick in his hand, as God told him to hold that stick in his hand and he would deliver Israel, and he went down and did it because God promised it. How is he going to do it? "I will be with you." [Exodus 3:10-12]

L-92 He said, "Show me Your glory, Lord. I'm slow of speech. I can't talk right. And I..." He had a million excuses. [Exodus 4:10]

L-93 But He said, "I'll be with you." And that's all it took. He went, taking God's Word. No matter how dangerous the task seemed, Moses continued to believe God. And God proved His Word, through Moses, to be the truth. Because, regardless of what took place, Moses stayed right with the Word. In the time of the journey... [Genesis 3:12]

L-94 God told them, down in Egypt, also, that He would deliver them, "Into a promised land, a good land, full of milk and honey." And it was absolutely there. They didn't know it was there, but He said, "It's there, and I have given it to you. It's already yours, just go claim it!" [Genesis 3:8]

L-95 And in the wilderness, when many of them come out, dancing in the Spirit, when Miriam beat the tambourine; eating manna out of Heaven; listened at Moses sing in the Spirit; watching the miracles and signs go forth. But when it come to a showdown, to believe the whole Word of God, all the promise, they failed. [Exodus 15:20-21] 65-0426, Proving His Word, Embassy Hotel, Los Angeles, CA, 123 min

L-96 Only two of them believed it, that was Joshua and Caleb. And they brought back the evidence that the land was good. [Numbers 13:30-33]

L-97 But, the circumstances was, that's what was what hindered them. Because, they said, "We're not able to take that land, because their cities are walled, their--their--their delegates there. Not their delegates, but their--their people are a great giants. Why, we look like grasshoppers, up aside of them." [Numbers 13:26-33]

L-98 Joshua and Caleb said, "We are more than able to take it." Why? God had give it to them, no matter how big the giants was. The obstacle meant nothing to them. God had said so! And God proved it by them. And they did go over and take the land, as God said they would do it. He proved it to them. [Numbers 13:30]

L-99 Now, when they come up in the month of April, when the waters was flying down out of the mountains, over the snowdrifts, and so forth, and looked like that God was a poor general, to lead His army right up to a place, He had them pinned off from the promised land. And the very time He taken them over, was going to take them over, it was the worst month in the year. The month that the Jordan was overflowing its banks, run plumb out into the fields. Why, if they was going to take them over, it would be in the summertime, when they could wade across. But He waited till the waters got deep. He likes to show that He's God. He likes to prove His Word, regardless. [Joshua 3:15-17]

L-100 Don't care whether the doctor said, "You're dying with cancer." That's all the man knows. Maybe the waters are deep for some of you, tonight. But, remember, God made the promise. God keeps His Word, and God proves His Word. It's the Truth.

L-101 He waited till the waters got muddy, until they got deep and over their heads, and so forth, and then He opened up the way. He went before them and made the way. [Joshua 3:15-17] How they going to get in, the Jericho, when it was all closed over? Joshua was wondering. He knowed God had led him that far, the next step belongs to God.

L-102 One day, when he was out walking around, viewing the walls, he seen a Man standing with His sword drawed. And he pulled his sword and went to meet the Man, he said, "Who are You for? Are You with us or are You for our enemy?" [Joshua 5:13], [Joshua 3:13]

L-103 He said, "I am the Captain of the hosts of the Lord." And He told him what to do. How is he going to blow a trumpet and a wall fall down, that they could run a chariot race across it? What would have anything to do with a trumpet? [Joshua 5:14]

L-104 God uses such simple methods. It's so, the simplicity of it, what makes it God to me. We're always trying to find some great something, is going to do something, and God... some great organization is going to take the whole thing and clear it all out. When, God takes a simple person, just one man that He can hold in His hands, and He'll prove every Word that He said, by It. Takes such simple little methods!

L-105 "Sound a trumpet." Not dig out the wall, but, "Just sound a trumpet, and the walls will fall down. The blast of the trumpet will knock the walls down." How foolish to the carnal mind! But God proved His Word was true, for the walls fell down, one on top the other. They went straight up and they took the city. [Joshua 6:20]

L-106 Oh, God likes to prove Hisself to be God! Joshua knowed that. One day, and when he was standing there, one of the greatest paradoxes that ever happened, outside of the death, burial, and resurrection of Jesus Christ. When the enemy... He had routed them, and the different armies was in the mountains. He had them routed, and the sun was going down. Oh, my, what a time it was for General Joshua! [Joshua 10:9-14]

L-107 Remember, he fought that land through, without having a hospital, a nurse, a first-aid band, or a wounded man. Tell me something that can beat that. Yes, sir. He never had no hospitals, no nurses, and he never lost any man, as long as they walked in the will and Word of the Lord. God proved that He was with them. That's right. Notice now.

L-108 And we find out that Joshua knew, if night come, they'd slip around and get with one another, and--and get theirself together and make another big army, and he'd have a rough time with them the next day. He didn't know what to do, so he looked up to God. He needed help, and he needed that sun to stand still. So he just commanded that sun to 65-0426, Proving His Word, Embassy Hotel, Los Angeles, CA, 123 min stand still, and the... said for "the moon to hang over Ajalon," not move until he commanded it. And the moon and sun stayed still for twenty-four hours, when Joshua fought the battle and conquered the enemy, because he was right in the line of duty. He had a right to do it, because he was obeying God's commandment. [Joshua 10:12-14]

L-109 And as long as you are in the line of duty, keeping God's Word, doing just what He told you to do, marching by the orders of God, you've got a right to say to that mountain, "Be moved!" [Matthew 17:20], [Mark 11:23-24], [Matthew 21:21-22]

L-110 God keeps His Word. "If you say to this mountain, 'Be moved,' don't doubt in your heart, but believe that that what you said will come to pass, you can have that what you have said." Jesus said that, in Saint Mark 11:22. That's the Truth. I know that's the Truth. It's God's Word, and that proves that it's the Truth. We're just afraid sometimes. We get to a place, we're afraid He won't keep that Word. He will keep that Word. He said He would do it. Now, we find that's true. He proved it. [Matthew 21:21-22], [Mark 11:23-24]

L-111 Isaiah's prophecy, one time, which something that had never happened; never did before, and never has since. He said, "A virgin shall conceive." Could you imagine a woman, without knowing a man, would have a child? Isaiah said, "A virgin shall conceive." [Isaiah 7:14]

L-112 And God caused a virgin to conceive, to prove His Word truth. He proved His Word, 'cause a virgin did conceive and she brought forth the Son. [Isaiah 7:14], [Matthew 1:18-23], [Luke 1:27-38]

L-113 Now, that Word made flesh, look what It did. When that Son came forth, He was the Word Himself. "In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God. And the Word was made flesh and dwelt among us." [John 1:1, 14]

L-114 He was that living Word. He proved He was that living Word. He said to those teachers of that day, "Who can condemn me of sin?" Sin is "unbelief." "Who can tell Me that I'm an unbeliever? Every Word that's written of Me, has been fulfilled." The last seven predictions of His life was fulfilled in the last seven hours, on the cross. Everything was written of Him, was fulfilled, because He was the Word. He proved He were, was. He healed the sick. He raised the dead. He conquered death, hell, and the grave. He proved He was the Word.

L-115 Notice this case here at Jairus' house. He was... He had told them the truth. We see Him as He crossed the sea. He comes in. [Luke 8:41-42], [Mark 5:22-24]

L-116 There was a little woman up on the hill, that had spent all of her money with the physicians. No doubt, the physicians had done all they knowed how to do, to get the woman well; probably Hebrew physicians, and that was a Hebrew woman, so they had done all they could for their sister. Although, they had nothing to stop this blood issue, which was, perhaps, a menopause time and her blood had flowed forth till she... little thing was so weak she could hardly get around any more. And she had heard about Jesus. And when she seen the little boat push into the willows, she went down to find out. [Luke 8:43-48], [Mark 5:25-34]

L-117 A lot of His critics was standing there. And He is not free of critics today. If they'd have knowed Who He was, they would not have been His critics. But they was His critics because they didn't know Who He was.

L-118 And that's the way with the Message today, so many good men and women criticize This because they don't know what It is.

L-119 Jesus said, "If you'd have knowed Moses, you'd have knowed Me. Moses spoke of Me. Many great man longed to see this day. If I do not the works of My Father, then believe Me not. I have greater witness," He said, "than that of John, for the works that I do, prove that the Father is with Me." He had greater works, because He was the Identified. John was identified also, as the voice of one crying in the wilderness. But when He come, He was the prophet that Moses had spoke of would be raised up. [John 5:46]

L-120 As I said the other night, He come in three names; the name of the Son of God, Son of man, and Son of David. [John 1:34], [Luke 17:30]

L-121 When He was on earth here, the first time, He was the Son of man. He could not be Son of God then; He never 65-0426, Proving His Word, Embassy Hotel, Los Angeles, CA, 123 min claimed to be. He said He was "Son of man." When anybody would question Him, He said, "You see the Son of man; the Son of man." Now, "Son of man" is a prophet. He had to come that way, because, the Scripture, He cannot come contrary to the Scripture. [Luke 17:30]

L-122 That's why, today, that our--our Message of this hour cannot come through theologians and theology, it's got to come back to the same thing it promised to do. It must be that way.

L-123 So we find that, in this Man, He had to be a prophet. Not Son of God there, He had to be Son of man. Jehovah Himself called the prophets, Jeremiah and them, "Son of man." "When you see the Son of man..." "Who is the Son of man?" they kept asking. [Luke 17:30]

L-124 Then, He served His office as Son of man. Then He served His office now as Son of God. God is a Spirit, and when now He served through the Church Ages, as Son of God. Now, in the Millennium, He'll be Son of David, when He sits on the throne of David. He'll be heir to the throne, Son of David. Son of man, Son of God, Son of David, and it's the same Man all the time. [Luke 17:30]

L-125 Just like Father, Son, and Holy Ghost; the office of God. He was God the Father, then He became God the Son, now He is God the Holy Ghost. Not three Gods; one God, three manifestation, three attributes of the same God.

L-126 Now we find, and in this hour that we're now living, God keeps His Word just the same as He did then.

L-127 We find out that He come across the sea. This woman believed Him, there was something within her begin to pound. She had no Scripture for it, no more Scripture than Joshua had to stop the sun, but she believed in her heart that He was the Son of God. So she said, "If I can only touch His garment, I will be healed." So she pressed through the crowd until she touched His garment, and the blood issue stopped. [Matthew 9:21]

L-128 Now, He looked upon the audience, to find out who touched Him. No doubt, there was someone. He stopped. All the people thronging Him; and some making fun of Him, some laughing at Him; the priest standing off and questioning Him, and the clergymen, and so forth. But there was some who believed Him. And, and after a while He stopped, all of a sudden, turned around, said, "Who touched Me?" [Luke 8:43-47]

L-129 Some of them said, "Why, Master!" I believe it was Peter said, "Why, the whole crowd is thronging You. Why, who 'touched' You? Why, everybody is touching You!" [Luke 8:45]

L-130 He said, "But I perceive that virtue has gone from Me." He got weak. It was a different kind of touch. [Luke 8:46]

L-131 If we could only see that, brother, sister! If you can touch Him with that certain touch! Oh, sick people, I'm fixing to pray for you, just in a few minutes. I do believe that I have the Holy Spirit, no more Holy Spirit than what you've got right out there, these men has got here. The same Holy Spirit, but it's a commandment of God; and if you'll believe that to be the commandment of God, of praying for the sick, and laying hands on them, and casting out evil spirits, and the promises that He has made, it'll be the same thing with you. You'll get what you ask for, if you can believe it. "Canst thou believe that I'm able to do this?" said Jesus. [Mark 5:27-28]

L-132 "Yeah, Lord, I believe," said the man with the child with the epilepsy, "I believe that Thou art the Son of God that was to come into the world." Now, we know that that can only take that attitude to bring the results. [Mark 9:17-24]

L-133 Now, quickly, let's think of Him a moment, here He is on His road up. A little priest came down, no doubt but that little fellow was a borderline believer.

L-134 There is so many of them in the world today, little borderline believers. They want to believe That. They want to believe that the Holy Ghost is real. They want to believe this is the apostolic move, as God promised in the last days He would pour out His Spirit. We... he wants to believe in Malachi 4, that He promised, in the last days the--the original pentecostal Faith would be restored back to the--to the church again. [Malachi 4:5-6]

L-135 Malachi 4 claims it. "Behold, I will send to you Elijah in the last day," that's right, "and He will restore the Faith of the children back to the fathers again," see, "the Faith of the fathers to the children, also." See, it's got to be. You say, "Well, that was John the Baptist." No, no. [Malachi 4:5-6]

L-136 John the Baptist was Malachi 3. That's right. Matthew 11 says so, "If you can receive it, this is he who is spoke of, 65-0426, Proving His Word, Embassy Hotel, Los Angeles, CA, 123 min 'Behold, I send My messenger before My face.'" It was Elijah, certainly. Jesus said it was. But not the Elijah of Malachi 4, at all. [Malachi 3:1], [Matthew 11:9-11], [Mark 1:2-3], [Luke 7:26-28]

L-137 Because, "Immediately after that Message, the earth is to be burnt with fire, and the righteous walk out upon the ashes of the wicked." So it never happened in the time of John. We've got to have a Message sweep back and bring the people out of all these denominational conditions, back to the original, genuine pentecostal Faith. And we're seeing it done, it's fulfilling of a Scripture that has to come to pass. All Scriptures must be fulfilled. How many more of that we could apply, it would take me longer than my time up now, to show. But you understand these things, that it's got to happen just exactly like this, to Abraham's children, just as He promised. [Malachi 4:2-3, 5-6]

L-138 We see Jesus going up now to heal the little girl. Cause, the father, the little borderline believer, something come to a spot that he had to recognize Jesus, so, the doctor had given her up. And he got on his little black hat and took off down to find out whether he could find Jesus. See, He is always right there when you want Him. He found Him just coming into the shore. [Luke 8:41]

L-139 And he said, "Come to my little girl, lay Your hands upon her, and she will be made well." Said, "She is laying at the point of death. She is my only child." Said, "She is twelve years of age. We don't have no other children. Wife and I," perhaps, "are getting old. And this is the only child that we have, and she is laying at the point of death. Lord, I believe You. If You'll just come lay Your hands upon her, she'll get well." [Luke 8:41-42] See, what did he recognize? He recognized that that promised Word of God was manifested in this Man.

L-140 Just the same as Nicodemus said, "Rabbi, teacher, we know Thou art a teacher comes from God. We know it. The Pharisees know it." Why didn't they confess it? "No man could do the things that You do, 'less God was with Him. We know that You come from God." [John 3:2]

L-141 Here we find out that Jairus believed the same thing. He said, "Come lay Your hand." He knowed that God was in Him. "Lay Your hands upon my child. Though she is at the point of death, she'll live." [Luke 8:41-42], [Mark 5:23]

L-142 He just walked along with him. And while he was going, here come a runner coming back, and said, "Don't trouble Him, don't trouble the Master any farther. The--the girl, dead, she's gone on now. She's passed on." [Luke 8:49]

L-143 Jesus turned to Jairus, said, "Didn't I say to you, 'If you would only believe, you'll see the glory of God'? If you'll just only believe it!" [Luke 8:50]

L-144 He got into the room, and there they was, all lamenting and crying, and wailing, just like any persons would do. A fine little girl, a pastor's daughter, had died, and she was taken out of this world. And she probably been dead for hours, and then they had laid her out on the couch, and was ready to embalm her body, perhaps, and put her away, and in burial. Then we find that Jesus walked in the house. They was all wailing. He says, "Give peace." He said, "She is not dead, but she is asleep." [Luke 8:52]

L-145 Now could you imagine what they thought? "Why, this man we know, now. We understand that He's an illegitimate child. And we hear of His, all of His rashel predictions that He makes. And now we know that the priest is right, 'the man is crazy,' for we know that she is dead. The doctor pronounced her 'dead,' and there she lays. She is gone, and we know she is dead." They said, they laughed Him to scorn, in other words, made Him feel embarrassed, by criticizing Him. [Luke 8:52-53], [Mark 5:38-40]

L-146 But He had done said that she wasn't dead. That's all it takes. "She is asleep." No matter how much critics, He's going to prove His Word! He put them all out of the house, get all the unbelievers away. Took Peter, James, and John, the believers, three witnesses, and the father and mother, went in and took the daughter by the hand, and spoke in a language that called her soul back from somewhere out yonder in Eternity. And the girl lived. [Luke 8:51, 54-56], [Mark 5:37, 40-42]

L-147 What did He do? He proved His Word. He proved that what He said. She was not dead. She was asleep. Now we find out, doing this, realizing, and He proved something else there. Now He proved that He was God. He proved that He had foreknowledge. Watch what His Word said now. "She is not dead, but she is asleep." See, she wasn't dead, to 65-0426, Proving His Word, Embassy Hotel, Los Angeles, CA, 123 min begin with. She was asleep. Showed His foreknowledge. Now, there might have been a many of little maiden died that same morning, but this one wasn't dead. She was asleep, like Lazarus was. And He called her out of that sleep, because she wasn't dead. [Luke 8:52-56], [Mark 5:39-43], [John 11:11, 43-44]

L-148 "And he that believeth in Me, though he were dead, yet shall he live; and whosoever liveth and believeth in Me, shall never die." Only those who are on the Lamb's Book of Life, that He redeemed when He died, that's who He'll call out of that sleep, at that day, those who are quickened by His power, that has that quickening power laying in them. Even as I said last night; even after Elisha had died, and his bones was laying in the grave, that quickening power was still on his bones. [John 11:25-26]

L-149 Sure, He proved that Who He was. Now we find out again, likewise, He proved also, that, in Hebrews the 4th chapter and the 12th verse, He proved He was the Word of God. He certainly did. Notice what He did. Hebrews, 12, Hebrews 4:12 says that, "The Word of God is more powerful, quicker than a two-edged sword, and--and It also is a Discerner of the thoughts and the intents of the heart." Watch just a moment now. [Hebrews 4:12]

L-150 When He first started His ministry, after He come out to show that He was the Word, when He come out of the wilderness from His temptation, there was a man named Peter, his name then was Simon. And he came to Jesus with his brother, Andrew. And as soon as he walked up into the Presence of Jesus Christ, Jesus said, "Your name is Simon. And your father's was Jonas. From henceforth you shall be called Peter." That proved that He was the Word, because the Word is a Discerner of the thoughts and intents of the heart. He was the Word. [John 1:42]

L-151 Philip seen this happening. He took off around the mountain, was gone a day, and come back. And he brought with him a friend named Nathanael. And he said, "These things are really happening. Moses said 'the Lord our God shall raise up a Prophet' like him, and here the Man is. Why, He told Simon who he was, even who his father was, and we know that what He says is the truth. Because, God said it in the Word, and here it is proved that He was to do that, and that proves that that is the Messiah." [John 1:40-48]

L-152 And when he walked up in His Presence, Jesus said to him, said, "Behold an Israelite, in whom there is no guile." [John 1:47-48] He said, "Rabbi, when did You know me?"

L-153 Said, "Before Philip called you, when you were under the tree, I saw you." He proved His Word. He proved God's Word. He did. [John 1:48]

L-154 The woman at the well, when she had... Well, He asked her to let Him have a drink of water from the pitcher that she was drawing water from the well, and she said, "It's not customary for you Jews to ask we Samaritan women such a thing as that, because we have no dealing." [John 4:9]

L-155 He said, "But if you knew Who you were speaking with, you would ask Me for a drink." She said, "The well is deep." [John 4:10-11]

L-156 And the conversation, as it moved on, finally He found out what her trouble was. And He said, "Go get your husband, and come here." She said, "I don't have any husband." [John 4:16-17]

L-157 He said, "Thou has said truth, for you've had five, and the one you're living with now is not your husband." [John 4:18]

L-158 "Why," she said, "sir, I perceive that You are a prophet." She..."We hadn't had one for four hundred years, you know." Said, "I perceive that You are a prophet. Now, we know that when the Messiah cometh, which is called the Christ, when He comes, He will tell us these kind of things. That will be His sign." [John 4:19]

L-159 When He said, "I am He that speaks with you," He proved His Word. He... we prove what He claimed to be. He was the Messiah, the Son of God. [John 4:21-24, 25]

L-160 Now we find out, also, that this little woman that had this blood issue, that touched His garment, that also proved to her that He was the Word of God. [Luke 8:43-48] 65-0426, Proving His Word, Embassy Hotel, Los Angeles, CA, 123 min

L-161 Now remember, tonight, Jesus said... Also, in Hebrews, 1, Hebrews the 3rd chapter, I believe it is, He said that, "He now is a High Priest," this age we're living in now, "a High Priest sitting in the Majesty of God, in the Heavens, that can be touched by the feeling of our infirmity." [Hebrews 4:15]

L-162 Hebrews 13:8 said, "He's the same, yesterday, today, and forever." He's the same God that He was then. He's the same tonight. [Hebrews 13:8]

L-163 Saint John 14:12, He said, "He that believeth on me, the works that I do shall he do also. Even more than this shall he do, for I go to My Father." See? "He that believeth on me, these works that I do shall he do also." [John 14:12]

L-164 In Matthew 28, He said, "A little while and the world won't see Me no more, yet ye shall see Me, for I will be with you even to the end of the world." [John 16:16-19]

L-165 Jesus Christ is the same yesterday, today, and forever. He stands, tonight, to prove His Word. (My time is gone.) But He proved He could. He proved His Word then, what He had promised for that day. He proved Isaiah's words. He proved Noah's words. He proved Moses' words. He proved every one of the prophets' words. [Hebrews 13:8]

L-166 He promised that in this day, the day that we're living in, that the world would be in a Sodom condition, homosexuals. Just look at it in the world today, all over the world where I travel; not only here, everywhere. It's critical. In Sweden, young men and women go skiing, stark-naked. And they in Germany and in France, and everywhere else, it's just about kind of a riffraff that we have here in the United States. It's an age. I, if I get a chance to ever come back, I'd like to speak on some of the prophetic things, to you, and show you that, the age that we're living in. The Bible said that, "Children would rule their parents." [Blank.spot.on.tape--Ed.]... Word.

L-167 But, remember, Abraham had a seed, which was the seed Isaac. He had other seeds after Sarah's death. And he was a hundred and forty-five years old, he married another woman, had seven sons besides daughters, 'cause God had turned him back to a young man when he was a hundred years old. He was then again just forty-five, so then he... We know that. I've preached that to you here in California, years ago. [Galatians 3:16]

L-168 And now we understand that Abraham's Seed was not the literal sexual seed through Sarah, which was Isaac, which made a nation, but the royal Seed was by the promise, which was Jesus Christ. And through that Seed, He raised up a royal Seed. Oh, my! Now we are a royal priesthood, a royal nation, a holy nation, offering praises to God, the sacrifice of our lips giving praise to His Name. God proved His Word, He poured out the Holy Ghost upon us. [Romans 9:7-8], [Romans 4:1-5, 13-22]

L-169 He said, "As it was in the days of Sodom, so shall it be in the day when the Son of man will being revealed." Now did you notice? From Son of God, just before He become Son of David, He reveals Himself again as Son of man. Did you notice the Scripture? [Luke 17:28]

L-170 For, He always does, He never does nothing unless He makes it known to His servants the prophets. That's exactly. That's what His promise was. See? He never does nothing... God cannot lie. He always reveals it, first, before He does it. [Amos 3:7]

L-171 Look at the situation we're sitting in today. Look where we're at. Every one of you will admit we're in a modern Sodom. You know this country is in for it. They're beyond hopes. There is no salvation left for this nation or no other nation. We're beyond that now. The prophecies that's prophesied about this, is fulfilled. God is gleaning, getting that little sheep wherever it is. It'll all be in, one day. We're at the end time. Look, positionally.

L-172 I ask you, just as a brother or sister, to build just a moment more of faith before we pray for these people. And I know we don't have to go at no certain time. But I--I--I want to start the prayer line, then you that have to go may go then. See? You that want to stay in the prayer line may stay. But just let me, just as a brother, just point out something to you a moment.

L-173 Watch Jesus, in Luke 17:30, see, when He was saying there about the end time, how they would be like in days of Noah. Then He said, "And like, likewise, in the days of Sodom," said, "when the Son of man is being revealed." The 65-0426, Proving His Word, Embassy Hotel, Los Angeles, CA, 123 min Son of man again, not Son of God. "Son of man," see, that brings in Malachi 4 again, right straight back. All these other prophecies coming right in, how it's supposed to be done. He proves His Word to be so. That's right. [Luke 17:30], [Malachi 4:5-6]

L-174 And notice, in doing so, how He is going to pour out His Spirit upon all flesh, and what's going to take place, how the restoration will come back. "And your sons and daughters shall prophesy. Upon My handsmaids and maidservants will I pour out of My Spirit. And I'll show signs in the heavens above." [Acts 2:17-20], [Joel 2:28-31]

L-175 I got a picture here, of Brother Lee Vayle's here. I'd like to show you just what taken place up on the mountain, the other day, when all the school kids turned out, just before this great subject of the open, them Seven Seals. When the school kids turned out, when I was up in there praying, here was Fire just in a funnel coming down, then go back up and burst out, and turn around and come back down again. That's what He said what to go tell the people. We... There It is, where the schools of Tucson... and where It went up into the air.

L-176 And science took the pictures, and so forth, and questioned about It. They said, "Where is It at? What happened?" They can't make it out, see. Oh, it's not done in a corner, only darkened conscience. It never... Jesus, when He was here, there was millions of people never knew He was on earth. Yeah. There will be millions today won't understand, tens of millions of them.

L-177 But there will be, to those Who It's sent to, they will understand. "The wise shall know their God in that day, and they'll do exploits." We realize that, the hour that we're now living.

L-178 Look at Sodom now, look what happened. He said, "As it was in the days of Sodom." There was a group of people that was looking for a promised son. We believe that. That was Abraham and his group. There was a lukewarm bunch, Lot, half backslid, yet a believer; down in Sodom. Three classes of people. [Luke 17:28-30]

L-179 There is always them three classes. Ham, Shem, Japheth's people. Also, believers, make-believers, and unbelievers. They're everywhere, and we--we find them in every group. And, everywhere, you find them. And that groups is still here. You have to divide that. You can take it right through the Scripture, just dovetails itself right in. [Genesis 9:18-27]

L-180 Listen to this. Look at where we're sitting, positionally and prophetically, tonight. Now, every one of us know that the world is in a Sodomite condition.

L-181 We know all the prophecies of Israel, is in its homeland. If you want to know nationally where we are standing, watch Israel, where it's at.

L-182 If you want to know what condition the church is, watch the way women act. She's the church. See her, immoral, indecent; watch, look where the church is at. Just watch it, see, see, just watch women. You see where, how your women degrade and become so polluted, that's the way your church is, see, the type.

L-183 Watch where Israel is, you see the time figure where we're at. See, just watch those signs and wonders. If you--if you, or if your eyes is open, see where we're at.

L-184 Now watch positionally where we're setting, the world in a Sodom condition. Now notice, "as it was." Now notice, there was somebody, in that day, watching for a coming promised son. Abraham and Sarah, they were watching for a promised son in Abraham's group. They was not in Sodom. But just at the moment, the last chapter of the event, just before the promised son came, there were three man came down from Heaven, an Angel... two Angels and God. And they came down and talked with Abraham, under the oak. Is that right? [Congregation says, "Amen!"--Ed.] And two of them went down into Sodom and cried out against the sins of the city. And it was just before the burning of the Gentile world, at that time. All Sodom perished right then. Just a few was pulled out, Lot and his two daughters. His wife never even made it; she turned back. How I could just like to have time to show you that right now, where that church is standing at that position. I want you to notice now. [Genesis 19:1], [Genesis 17:1, 15-17], [Genesis 18:1-2, 9-15, 20-22], [Genesis 19:1, 12-13, 15-29]

L-185 And one Man stayed behind, that talked to Abraham, and he done a sign to Abraham. And, watch, Abraham had seen God in many great signs. We believe that, don't we? [Congregation says, "Amen."--Ed.] Just before the coming 65-0426, Proving His Word, Embassy Hotel, Los Angeles, CA, 123 min son. But before the son was manifested, there was a sign he was given. [Genesis 18:17-18]

L-186 Because, the Son, the true Son, was to be the Son of God, through Abraham's faith, see, was Jesus. We being Abraham's seed, dead in Christ, we are Abraham's seed.

L-187 Notice now just before that taken place, this son to come. Now, this One that stayed and talked to Abraham, had His back turned to the tent, and He said, "Abraham." Now, just a day before that, he was Abram. Now He said, "Abraham, where is thy wife, Sarah?" not Sarra, S-a-r-r-a. S-a-r-a-h, princess. "Where is thy wife, Sarah?" Said, "She is in the tent behind You." [Genesis 18:9]

L-188 He said, "I'm going to visit you, see, according to My promise that I made you." In other words, "The time of life, Sarah will start in her ordinary time of life again." [Genesis 18:10]

L-189 And Sarah, being old, a hundred years old now, in the tent, laughed up her sleeve. See, she smiled to herself, said, "How could that Man be right? See, me an old woman, my lord Abraham out there, also old, family affair had been done away with for years." Said, "How can I ever have pleasure again with my lord? He being old, and me old, past bearing, milk veins gone, every... 'She is dried up.' How could we ever have pleasure again?" [Genesis 18:10-13]

L-190 And that Man, with His back turned to the tent, said, "Why did Sarah laugh, saying, 'How can these things be?'" What was that? Discernment, a prophetic! See? See? That's what he seen. [Genesis 18:12-15]

L-191 Now He said, "That will return again, and the Son of man," which that was, that was the Son of man right there. Well, he called Him Elohim, "Lord God." Elohim, anybody knows that's right, Elohim is the Lord God. "In the beginning Elohim created heavens and earth," the all-sufficient One. The Son of man made flesh, there He was standing there in flesh at that time, like a theophany, standing there discerning what Sarah was saying in the tent behind Him. He promised. Watch. The Royal Seed of Abraham is promised to see that same thing. [John 1:1-4], [Genesis 1:1]

L-192 But notice Lot, he had a messenger down there, too, two of them went down there. One of them went down, and another one went down with him, and they preached and called the people to flee from the wrath that was to come. [Genesis 19:1]

L-193 Positionally, the world has never sit in that estate, from that day that Jesus made the promise, until right now. I want to ask any historian that might be in the building, or if you hear even on this tape, and hear it at any time, please write me. I've studied history now for some thirty years, the Bible history, and there never has been a person that I've ever seen in all the history of the church, through the seven church ages. That we're now in Laodicea, and we know that.

L-194 Never has there been a messenger, that ever went to the entire church, with his name ending with h-a-m, till now. G-r-a-h-a-m, Billy Graham. There has been Moody's, Finney, Sankey, Knox, Luther, and so forth, but never a h-a-m, "father to nations." Now remember, he is G-r-a-h-am, six letters. But A-b-r-a-h-a-m is seven letters. Notice, they're down there, Billy Graham, going into the--the all parts of the world, and calling out of Sodom, "Come out, flee the wrath that is to come." There is no man that I know of, in the field, that has got a hold of God, on that word of justification, like Billy Graham does. He can present it. He's not such a theologian... I guess he's a theologian, but he's not just a powerful teacher. But God is with him. That man will stand there with like a Sunday school lesson, hold those people spellbound. He's God's servant of the hour. To who? The church natural, that's in Sodom.

L-195 But remember, there was one church spiritual, that wasn't in that denominational outfit, either. Called-out group, and they received a message, also, and a messenger. And what was it? Discerning the thoughts that was in the heart. God always proves His Word.

L-196 Let's pray. Dear Heavenly Father, this crucial moment, where decisions must be made, time is ticking on by, we don't know what hour our Lord may come. And as we see these prophecies that's been made by Him, through Your prophets down through the ages, is now being unfolded. O God, how I thank You for this, that even able-bodied man, able man in--in theology, that can stand up against the wiles of the world and the unbelievers, and on these panels, and beyond a shadow of doubt stand there bold and gallant, knowing where they're standing and prove that Word to be true, by the Scriptures. And then we who are waiting on Your Coming, Lord, believing these other things that's been prophesied that would take place, to stand and enjoy seeing You walk right among us and perform the very thing that 65-0426, Proving His Word, Embassy Hotel, Los Angeles, CA, 123 min You said would come to pass, proving Your Word to be right. Eternal God, Your sick children are sitting here.

L-197 I don't know how much more time we've got to work. The evening sun is sinking. But You promised, to the prophet, "It shall be Light about the evening time." And we see the same sun rises in the east, is the one that sets in the west. Civilization has traveled with the sun and now we're at the West Coast, and the Gospel traveled with civilization. Now, Father, we know this is the end of the Gospel, the end of time, the end of the age. She is fading into Eternity. But You promised that the Son would come out, the Son of man would be revealed. In the last day, this would take place. The evening Lights have come, Father. We thank Thee for that. And humbly as it is, yet You do it so simple, many times, that it goes way over the top of the great, so-called deep thinkers, and reveals it to babes such as will learn.

L-198 I pray, God, that You'll make it so, tonight, that Your poor sick children here will see the promise of God, and each one of them will be healed, and go out of here, tomorrow, with new strong bodies, and be well again. Grant it, Lord, so that they can take the Message from one to the other, till that last one is in the fold, and then the doors will be shut. Help us, dear God. I ask You, tonight, in the face of all this, if You'll just once more, Father, for me.

L-199 It--it seemed, the other night, the people never noticed it much. But, I pray, let it happen again tonight, Lord. Cause, I have went over my lotted time to speak, but I don't know how much longer we're going to have to do this. So, I pray, Father, will You hear me? And hear the prayer of these godly men and women that's sitting here tonight, who is filled with Your Spirit. They are believers, Lord, You can just work among them. And we're... I pray that You'll confirm Your Word that You said, "He that believeth on Me, the works that I do shall he do also." Let it be again, Jesus, to prove that You are the same yesterday, today, and forever. I ask it for the glory of God, in the Name of His Son, Jesus Christ. Amen. [John 14:12]

L-200 Now, just for a moment, I want to know how many people in here that have prayer cards. I--I want you to raise your hands, each one of you that has prayer cards. Well, it's generally, I guess, just about all over.

L-201 I wonder how many people in here that does not have prayer cards, and yet you're sick, would you raise your hands and say, "I do not have a prayer card, and yet I am sick. I am needy."

L-202 I want to ask you to be reverent for a moment. Now, I love to talk to you. That's always my trouble, I talk too long. But before you come, I--I'd hope and trust that God will prove this and what I've said to be the Truth, and let--let Him just see.

L-203 Now, how many sitting out there that's sick, that knows that I don't know one thing about you, raise up your hands. Just look at that. All right.

L-204 I want you without the prayer cards now. The prayer cards will be called up. I want you to pray.

L-205 The Bible said that, "Jesus Christ is the same yesterday, today, and forever." He says, "He's a High Priest sitting there making intercessions upon our confession." We have to confess it first, before He can be a High Priest, 'cause He only intercedes to our confession. Is that right, minister brethren? [The ministers say, "Amen."--Ed.] See, He only intercedes upon our confession, what we confess that He is, what He has done for us. Not what He will do. He has already done it. We have to confess that He's done it. "He was wounded for our transgressions, with His stripes we were healed." [Hebrews 13:8], [Isaiah 53:5]

L-206 Now, the Heavenly Father knows. And looking upon you, is to see I recognize a good friend of mine from Ohio, him and his wife sitting here, is Mr. Dauch and his wife. And I believe, sitting second or third from them, is again that Reverend, Mr. Blair that I seen last night. It's dark over the audience, to me, account of these lights here is kind of a little blarry to me, and I--I don't see you too well.

L-207 But I want you to pray. And you put on your heart the thing that you have need of, and you ask our High Priest, Who can be touched by the feeling of our infirmities. [Hebrews 4:15]

L-208 Now, me not knowing you, and you might just touch me all over, be like touching your brother, your husband, your pastor, someone, it wouldn't--it wouldn't do no good. But if you touch Him, and if we are truly in line with His Spirit, then He can use your faith to touch Him, and by a gift to speak back through. 65-0426, Proving His Word, Embassy Hotel, Los Angeles, CA, 123 min

L-209 See, I'd be just as mute as this, this is here, without a voice speaking through it. There has got to... This, this is a mute without something here to speak through it. And so is any person, is a mute, when it comes to these things, unless God speaks through them.

L-210 Now you pray, and let's see if these things that I have said is the truth. God help it to be so. I don't say that He will. I hope that He will. I'm trusting that He will. He has never let me down yet, over the years, across and around the world, with all kinds of nations, and millions of people. He has never failed me yet. And I'm sure, just as sure as I believe I'm standing here, He won't fail me now.

L-211 I'm going to ask you just to be reverent and keep seated, just for a few moments. We're going to dismiss the main audience and pray for the sick, just in a moment.

L-212 But I want you, you believers, that if you'll just not look to me, but believe. Say, "I believe that what the man said is the Scripture. I don't know as we're as far up in the time as he says we are. But, if it is, then it's got to happen. If his Words are God's Words, then, his words will fail but God's Words won't."

L-213 God is obligated to back up His Word. He'll prove It. He'll prove It. "He that believeth on Me." He proved that this is the last day. He proved what would happen. He proved that this was supposed to happen. [John 5:24], [John 6:35]

L-214 And, remember, Abraham and his group never received one more sign from God, until the promised son arrived. How many knows that's true? [Congregation says, "Amen."--Ed.] That sign of discernment! And the royal Seed of Abraham, let me hear you... Let me tell you. THUS SAITH THE LORD, you're receiving your last sign. That's according to the Scriptures and the revelation of God that's in my heart, that speaks that this is the Truth. And I trust that you will believe it to be the Truth. [Genesis 18:9-15]

L-215 Now you believe. Everybody just believe, say, "Lord Jesus, let me touch You. I have a need in my heart, and I know Brother Branham knows nothing about me. I don't even know the man, he don't know me, but You know. And if he has told me the Truth, this will happen." I ask you, don't move now, just for a little bit. Be real...

L-216 See, you're spirit. And I take every spirit in here under my control, in the Name of Jesus Christ, that His Word might be fulfilled.

L-217 Now just be reverent. Pray. Look to Him, say, "Lord, I believe it. Help Thou my unbelief."

L-218 Let's start. I have to concentrate on some sort of the part of the building here, 'cause, see, so many of you, and each one of you is a spirit.

L-219 I cannot. You say, "What about me?" I could not tell you. It's sovereign. All the works of God is sovereign. There will be many people healed crossing this platform, tonight, there will probably be many not. It's all in the sovereign of God. Who can tell Him what to do? No one. He works according to His Own will, His Own plan.

L-220 But you just believe. Be humble. Don't be nervous. Just reach out for God, and say, "Lord God, I believe it." See? "Let me touch Your garment. I have need of such-and-such. I know the brother don't know me or know my need, but he told us about these things that You did, and say that You're here the same today."

L-221 That don't exclude you brethren here on the platform, any of you. I just ask you, my brethren, as fellow workers of the--of the Gospel of Christ. I speak to you just as sincerely as I know, as a--a dying man with you, see, leaving this world. We've got to leave. And I must give an account at the Day of Judgment, for what I say. I'm conscious of that, very conscious. And I appreciate you man, what you are, standing here with me, helping me. I'm trying to help you, to do everything I can, for the Kingdom-of-God's sake. I'm praying and asking.

L-222 Here, how many ever seen that Light in the picture? You seen the picture of It? [Congregation says, "Amen."--Ed.] There It hangs right there. Can't you see It?

L-223 It's up over that lady sitting there with her handkerchief. She is praying for a loved one. That's right, lady. [The lady says, "That's right, Brother Branham."--Ed.] That loved one... Do you believe me to be His prophet, or pardon me, His servant? ["I sure do."] You believe that? All right. Now, if God can reveal to me what's wrong, why, you will 65-0426, Proving His Word, Embassy Hotel, Los Angeles, CA, 123 min accept it to be from God, just as the woman that touched His garment? Now, you know you're--you're twenty or thirty feet from me, or more, you never touched me. But you've touched Something, that you know you're in contact with Something, Someone. What it is, it's for a woman, which is your daughter. That's right. Do you believe that she'll be made well? She is a dope addict. ["That's right."] That's exactly right. ["That's right, brother."] I see her swimming, drunk. See? Now, the handkerchief that you have in your hand, you place upon her, and don't doubt. I believe that God will deliver her. Will you believe it with me? Amen. ["Oh! Thank You, Jesus!"]

L-224 Now, I don't know the woman, but God knows her. Do you believe now with all your heart?

L-225 The man sitting up there with the striped shirt on, with a hernia, you believe that God would heal you and make you well? Do you believe that He'll do it? I've never seen the man in my life. You have a prayer card, sir? [The man says, "No, I don't."--Ed.] You don't have? You don't need one. "If thou canst believe!"

L-226 Here sits a woman trying to look over the top of this woman sitting right here. She is a stranger to me. But she is real nervous. I don't know her. I've never seen her, in my life. But God knows her, and she realizes right now she is in contact with Something. You've been praying there for some cause. The reason that you are, you can't stay no longer than tonight. You must leave the meeting. You're planning on going to your home, tomorrow. You're not from here, or neither are you from California. You're going east from here. You're going by air. You're planning, going by air. You're from Oklahoma. Yeah. That's right.

L-227 You are also in a dying condition. You come here to be prayed for. You do not have a prayer card. But you believed that you're going to be healed, if you could only get here. That's right. Also, your condition is cancer. The cancer is in the bone. Do you believe you're going to be healed now? You believe you're in contact with Him, my sister? Perhaps God will tell me who you are, then would that help you? If it is, raise up your hand if you believe that, that (God) it would help you. Alright, Mrs. Steel, you can return to Oklahoma. I don't know the lady. I have never seen her.

L-228 Here is a lady sitting right back here behind her. She is suffering with varicose veins. And she has also got a son that's an alcoholic, and she is praying for him. If she'll believe, she can be healed. Mrs. Mason, will you believe with all your heart, and believe that Jesus Christ will grant the healing to you? You do?

L-229 All right, then lay your hand on that lady sitting next to you there, she is praying for her husband that's unsaved. God will grant the healing. Let us pray.

L-230 Dear God, I pray that You'll grant that blessing to her. Give that woman the desire of her heart, Lord. Her faith is so close to You, it's touched You. And I pray, Father, that You'll help, in Jesus' Name. Amen.

L-231 Now believe with all your heart, that you receive it. Will you do that? All right. God bless you.

L-232 Do you believe your husband is going to be saved, lady? Do you believe with all your heart? Raise up your hand, you do.

L-233 There seems to be, before me, a woman that's very heavy. There she sits. You believe me to be God's servant? You believe me to be God's servant? You do? All right. I do not know you. What your trouble is, is glands. You're overweight. You've been to a doctor, he said he could do nothing about it, but that was an earthly doctor. See? Your... You just had a lot of sorrow. You've lost your husband. You're not from here. You're really from Arkansas. You're seeking work, also, and you can't find work. You was afraid that, something, you wouldn't get called. But your faith now has touched God. My sister, you go, believe. God give you a job, give you the desire of your heart.

L-234 God proves His Word to be true. Do you believe that to be so? [Congregation says, "Amen."--Ed.] Now I just want you to pray with me again.

L-235 Father, God, You are the same God that proved. When You said, "The girl is not dead, she is asleep," then You had to prove it. Now, You promised, that just before the coming of the end time, that the Son of man would reveal 65-0426, Proving His Word, Embassy Hotel, Los Angeles, CA, 123 min Himself in the same manner He did at Sodom. You promised it, Lord. Now You've come to the earth, in the form of the Holy Spirit, and got among us, tonight, we believing people, and have proved it. You have proved Your Word like You did that day. Lord, we need no more proof. You're among us. We love You. And we realize that this is the last sign just before Your Coming, according to the Scriptures. And all the shadows and types never fail. They have got to be positive.

L-236 So we pray, Father, as Your children come now to be prayed for, that every one will be healed. May there not be a sick person left among us, at the end of this healing service. O dear God, will You let Your anointing be so graciously upon Your people just now, that every one of them may be healed?

L-237 And if there be some here, who is not Your children yet, and upon the basis of these things, that... They have heard the Word and seen the thing done, just exactly proved to the very letter, and Who You are and what You are, that You're here.

L-238 And, Lord, would You--would You bless a lie? Why, certainly not, Lord. But You did promise to bless Your Word, and It would not return void. It would accomplish that which It was purposed for. And now You have did that before us, tonight, beyond any shadow of doubt.

L-239 And with our heads bowed, is there people here that never have believed before, that would like to just raise up your hand? With your head bowed, just raise up your hand. And stand to your feet, and say, "I now believe, with all my heart. And I want to accept Jesus Christ, right now." Would you do that, any people, any people that's here, that hasn't yet accepted Christ, and would want to do it at this time? I won't tell you... You go to the church of your choice. But I'm asking you to receive Jesus Christ while you... You'll probably never be no closer to Him until you see Him in person when He comes in His visible body from the Heavens. Will you now accept Him if you haven't already done it?

L-240 Upon basis of seeing no one here standing, I believe then all of you to be sane, sensible people, and realizing what you're doing. If you're sitting there under this, you remember, "If you're ashamed of Me before man, I'll be ashamed of you before My Father." There was somebody standing up, maybe, yes, in the audience, in the back. [Mark 8:38], [Luke 9:26]

L-241 Dear God, those may, I not see, that's standing, they want to accept You. They realize, Lord, that this has not been done until this time, and now You confirm it and prove that it's so. I pray, Father, that in their hearts, that's strangely moved at this time... How do we know but what this is the last person to come in? This may be the end for Los Angeles. This may be the last soul that'll be born into the Kingdom. We don't know when that times comes. And when it does, the door will be closed, the Body will be complete. It will not be a freak Body or a freak Bride. It'll just have so many members whose names were put on the Lamb's Book of Life before the foundation of the world, to which Jesus came to take, like Adam, walk right out to save his wife. I pray, God, that You'll receive them now into Your Kingdom. They're in Your hands. Deal with them, Lord, I pray in Jesus' Name. Amen.

L-242 God bless each one of you that stood. I didn't know some of you were standing. Some stood in the back, some up in the balcony. Now I want you to do one thing for me. Please understand me. Meet some minister here and talk it over with them, after the church is over. Will you do that? Don't let it fail. If you've never been baptized in Christian baptism, do that next, and then stay with your hands up until you receive the Holy Ghost.

L-243 Now, and many people has prayer cards here. We're going to ask them to stand, and come up here, and I guess walk across. Or shall I have to come... [A man says, "No."--Ed.] I'll not be able to. ["Come from this side over here."] From this side over here, can come out through this way, over on this side, the people who have prayer cards.

L-244 And now if there is any of you that must go, it's... I'm late. I'm sorry. I'll try to do a little better tomorrow night. At... it's ten minutes after ten, by the clock on the wall. Thank you very much for your attendance tonight, and may the God of Heaven bless you. If you'd like to stay and watch the prayer line, you're always welcome. But we're going to start praying for the sick now, and I don't want to hold you unless you want to stay. You're dismissed in the Name of the Lord Jesus. May God's peace go with you and bless you, and give you rest in your bodies, through the night, and grant you good health so you can come back again tomorrow night. God be with you now. 65-0426, Proving His Word, Embassy Hotel, Los Angeles, CA, 123 min

L-245 And let those who have prayer cards stand for prayer now, as universally we pray for the people. Now we want you to know, now, you that's standing with a prayer card, is there any doubt in your life? Is there any, pardon me, any sin in your life that you haven't confessed? If there is, let me ask you this. Don't come into the prayer line with unconfessed sin in your heart. Cause, you must... This is the children's bread, see. And if you're not a Christian, surrender your life to Christ, in the prayer line, then come. It's for the believer. Will you do it? Accept Him first as your Saviour, and then come across the platform, to be prayed for.

L-246 Now I'm going to pray for each individual; not just pass them by, like some kind of a routine. We're in a church now. I think Sister Wyatt has give us the reason that we can stay and pray. [A man says, "Yes, all night, as long as you want."--Ed.] We can stay as long as we want to. And I thank Sister Wyatt and the staff here, for letting us do that. God bless her. Her gallant husband stood on this platform, prayed for sick, until he died, as far as I know, a real soldier of the cross. And now I'm trying to keep on doing the same thing, bless this people.

L-247 And now I pray that each one of you comes past here... You don't have to confess anything that you want to. You don't have to say anything wrong with you. Just come and let me pray for you, and believe.

L-248 Do you believe that God has sent me to do this? Raise up your hand. Remember what the Angel of the Lord said? "If you get the people to believe you, be sincere when you pray, nothing shall stand before the prayer." And you know that's true. It's been proved, over and over.

L-249 Now I'm going to ask that our Sister Rose, if she will, to play that, Only Believe, or, The Great Physician Now Is Near, or something.

L-250 I want each one of you now in--in fellowship with me. Will you, also, you people that is not in the prayer line, will you be praying for these people? Well, promise them that, by raising up your hand, "I'll be praying, see. We'll all be praying." All right. Yeah.

L-251 I would that you would, if you have to leave, go real quietly now, so that they won't bother while we pray.

L-252 Do you believe it will be over now, sister? [The sister says, "With all my heart."--Ed.]

L-253 Dear God, I lay my hands upon sister, challenge the affliction of her body. In the Name of Jesus Christ, may it leave her. Amen. Bless you, sister.

L-254 You believe with all your heart? All your sins are confessed? You're, as far as you know, you're ready to receive your healing?

L-255 Dear God, I lay my hands upon my sister, in the Name of Your Son, Jesus Christ, and ask that the affliction of her body will be gone, in Jesus' Name. Amen.

L-256 All sins are confessed, and you're ready for your healing? You believe, brother? [The brother says, "I believe with all my heart."--Ed.]

L-257 Dear God, I lay my hands upon my brother, as we know that You're present here, Lord. I pray that You'll heal him, in the Name of Jesus Christ. Amen.

L-258 All sins confessed? No, you don't hear. [Brother Branham speaks slow and distinct because of the sister's deafness--Ed.] You believe that you will hear? [The sister says, "I believe. But I've been deaf."] You believe. The woman is deaf now. We go pray here.

L-259 Dear God, I pray that You will heal our sister, and take this deafness from her. She is sitting in a closed-off world, where she cannot hear. I pray that You'll grant her healing, through Jesus' Name.

L-260 I'm going to ask the people to keep your head bowed, a minute. I want to see what's happened to her. Now, please, in Jesus Christ's Name, let no one raise their head or eyes. Now, you mustn't do that till I tell you to.

L-261 Can you hear me now? [She says, "Some, distorted." Brother Branham claps his hands once. "I can hear you."--Ed.] Hear me? ["Some."] Can hear? She can hear now. [Brother Branham claps once more.] See? Hear that, 65-0426, Proving His Word, Embassy Hotel, Los Angeles, CA, 123 min some?

L-262 Now you believe with all your heart. You will? And you believe, and God will make you completely well. She said. I just prayed and put my hands on her ears, and she said she could hear something. All right, just go on now, believing that you're going to hear perfect, and you'll hear.

L-263 Is all sins confessed, sister? [The sister says, "Yes."--Ed.] You're ready for your healing? ["Yes."]

L-264 Dear God, I lay my hands upon my sister, knowing that in us is no good thing, in ourselves. But we know that we are Christians, borned of the Spirit of God. And we lay hands upon our sister and ask for her healing, in Jesus Christ's Name. Amen.

L-265 Now you believe you're going to be healed? [The sister says, "Fine!"--Ed.] All right, now you--you are healed. ["Yes!"] That's the way to do it. That's right. Right.

L-266 All sins are confessed? [The sister says, "Yes, sir."--Ed.] And you're ready for your healing? ["Yes."] You believe, by laying on of hands, that the God Who knows the hearts of the people, will make you well? ["I do."]

L-267 Our Heavenly Father, I pray that You'll heal our sister, as we lay our hands upon her and ask in the Name of Jesus Christ that You'll make her well. Amen.

L-268 How do you do? Of course, you know I know what's wrong with you. [The sister says, "Yeah."--Ed.] But I'm just not saying it; 'cause, you do, it'll--it'll just keep on going on and on. ["All right."] But if you will... Is all sins confessed? ["Yes, sir."] And you believe that God will make you well? ["Yes, sir."] Do you believe the arthritis... I done said it.

L-269 Dear God, I pray that You will help her and make her well. Grant it, in Jesus' Name. You won't be crippled. Go, believe with all your heart.

L-270 Do you believe that God will make you well? [The sister says, "Amen."--Ed.] All sins are confessed and you are ready for your healing? You believe your back will be all right?

L-271 Dear Heavenly Father, I pray that You will heal her and make her well. In the Name of Jesus Christ, may it be so. Amen. God bless you, sister. Go, believing now.

L-272 Is all sins confessed, sister, you are ready for your healing?

L-273 Dear God, her sins, she says, is confessed. I lay my hands upon this woman, in the Name of Jesus Christ, ask for her healing. Amen.

L-274 Are all sins confessed? You must be right, you're very sick, you know that. You know that I know what's wrong with you. And do you believe that God will make you well, heal your heart and make you completely well?

L-275 Dear God, I pray that in the Name of Jesus Christ, that You'll heal her and make her well. May this leave her, Father, in Jesus' Name. Amen. God bless you now. Don't doubt. Go, believing.

L-276 Sins all confessed? You're ready for healing?

L-277 Dear Heavenly Father, I lay my hands upon our sister. In the Name of Jesus Christ, may she be healed. Amen. Don't doubt. Go, believing.

L-278 All sins confessed, you're ready for healing?

L-279 Dear Heavenly Father, I pray that You will heal our brother, will make him well. Grant it, Father. I lay my hands on him, for this purpose, in the Name of Jesus Christ. Amen. God bless you. I believe it with all my heart.

L-280 Are you believing now, sister? All sins are confessed and you're ready for healing?

L-281 Dear God, I lay my hands upon sister, in the Name of Jesus Christ, may she be healed for Your glory. Amen.

L-282 Now just many times like that, just a touch, as Jesus said, "These signs will follow them that believe. If they lay 65-0426, Proving His Word, Embassy Hotel, Los Angeles, CA, 123 min their hands on the sick." I've begin to notice, in the meetings, that it takes effect fifty percent better than what it does when you call the people in line, have discernment, 'cause you only get to just a few. And, this a way, there is many more gets healed.

L-283 Have you confessed all your sins of unbelief and everything? You believe now that you're going to be healed? [The sister says, "Yes, and delivered."--Ed.]

L-284 Dear God, I pray that You'll heal our sister as I take her hands and ask in the Name of Jesus Christ for her healing. Amen. God bless you, sister.

L-285 Do you believe now? [The sister says, "Yes."--Ed.] All sins are confessed? ["Yes."]

L-286 Dear God, I lay my hands upon our sister, in the Name of Jesus Christ, for her healing. Amen. God bless you, sister. Seems like a very small thing, but it's God Who promised it.

L-287 Sins are confessed?

L-288 Dear God, I pray that You'll heal this our sister. As I lay hands upon her in the Name of Jesus Christ, may she go and be well. Amen.

L-289 Sins are confessed?

L-290 Dear God, I pray that You'll heal our sister, as I lay hands upon her, in Jesus Christ's Name. Amen.

L-291 Now as you come with the mechanics, may it strike the dynamics, it'll go to work.

L-292 Sins are confessed? [The sister then answers--Ed.] You are ready.

L-293 Dear God, I pray that You will heal her and make her well, in Jesus Christ's Name. Amen. God bless you, sister.

L-294 All sins confessed? [The sister says, "Everything."--Ed.]

L-295 Dear God, as this woman looks me in the eye, I believe that. I pray that You will heal her, in Jesus' Name.

L-296 You just bringing her, are you, sister? You're just bringing her? All right. [The sister says, "She is blind, also."--Ed.] You believe, sister, that God will make you well? [The blind sister says, "I believe God could give me eyesight again."] God bless you.

L-297 Heavenly Father, You're always merciful to the blind, and to the needy. Now they have seen what You've done tonight. So we believe, Lord, this great last sign moving among us now. I ask for this blind woman's sight to come to her, in Jesus Christ's Name. Amen.

L-298 [She which was blind, says, "Thank You, Jesus."--Ed.] Now, report to us now. Report it. ["I will!"]

L-299 [She which brought the blind sister, requests prayer--Ed.] Oh, yes, you believe that God will heal you? ["Hallelujah!"]

L-300 Dear Heavenly Father I lay my hands upon our sister and ask that You heal her, in Jesus Christ's Name. Amen.

L-301 God bless you, sister. Let us hear how you are, how you get along.

L-302 Do you believe, sister? [The sister says, "Yes, I do."--Ed.]

L-303 O Dear Heavenly Father, I pray for our sister, trusting that You will heal her now. I lay my hands on her, in the Name of Jesus Christ. Now believe. That's right. Just go, believing.

L-304 Do you believe, brother? [The brother says, "Yes."--Ed.] All sins confessed?

L-305 Dear God, I pray that You will heal our brother and make him well, in the Name of Jesus Christ. Amen.

L-306 You believe, sister? 65-0426, Proving His Word, Embassy Hotel, Los Angeles, CA, 123 min

L-307 O God, I pray that, in Jesus Christ's Name, humbly, in the sweetness and meekness of this hour, may the Holy Spirit make this woman whole. [The sister says, "And I ask, pray for my son. I haven't seen him for twenty years."--Ed.] I pray that God will send your son to you, sister, dear. God bless you.

L-308 Dear Father, I pray for our sister here. In the sweetness of the Holy Spirit, may He come now and heal our sister, in Jesus' Name. Amen. Bless you, sister.

L-309 Dear God, I pray for my brother, as he stands here and I lay hands upon him, and ask for his healing, in Jesus' Name.

L-310 Bless you, my brother. [The brother says, "God bless you."] All right. Little boy?

L-311 Dear God, laying hands upon the little one, I bless him in the Name of Jesus Christ, for his healing.

L-312 You believe now, sister? [The sister says, "Yes."--Ed.] You want to be prayed for too?

L-313 Dear God, I pray for her, as I lay hands upon her. Now, this is Your commission, that's what You said do, "These signs shall follow them that believe. If they lay their hands on the sick, they shall recover." You said it, Lord. Amen. Now, He said that, didn't He? Has to be that way, sister.

L-314 Dear God, I pray that You'll heal our sister and make her well, in Jesus Christ's Name. Amen. God bless you, sister.

L-315 You've come believing, sister?

L-316 Dear Heavenly Father, I ask Your blessings on our sister, just obeying what You said do. You said, "These signs shall follow them that believe. If they lay their hands on the sick," You said, "they shall recover."

L-317 May I stop here just a moment, to say in this, just to let the people rest a moment, just for a moment. A critic once said, to me, that isn't so. But, you see, He said, "These signs shall follow."

L-318 You've heard my Message on The Trial, putting Jesus on trial. See, He told Noah, "It was going to rain." It never rained for a hundred and twenty years, but it rained anyhow. He told Abraham he'd have a son by Sarah. It was twenty-five years later. He never said when. He said they'd have the son. Twenty-five years later, it happened. See, He didn't say when.

L-319 He said, "The prayer of faith shall save the sick. God shall raise them up. If they lay hands on the sick, they shall recover." Is that what He said? [Congregation says, "Amen."--Ed.] He didn't say they'd jump up and do it right then. He said, "They shall recover." See, that's His promise. That's what we believe. [James 5:15]

L-320 Come, sister. You believe that to be true? [The sister says, "Yes, I do."--Ed.] Then there is no way to keep you from being healed.

L-321 I lay my hands upon sister, in the Name of Jesus Christ, for her healing. Amen.

L-322 Do you believe, sister? [The sister says, "Yes."--Ed.] All sins confessed, and ready?

L-323 Dear God, I lay my hands upon sister, in obedience to Your commandment, and ask for her healing, in Jesus' Name. Amen.

L-324 I want you that's being prayed for, I want you to do me a favor. I want you to report, before these meetings are over, what happens; and just let the audience, the other people, see what really takes place. Maybe tomorrow, next day, or when, you just watch what takes place.

L-325 My mail has showed that it's--it's so much different than just to letting them try, test their own faith. Because, Jesus said, "They lay hands upon them. They lay hands upon them, they shall recover." Now get what He said. He didn't say they'd jump up and run up-and- down the floor. They could do that. But He said, "They shall recover." Is that what He said? That's what He said. That's what I believe. And He is here now, the One that said the Word is here to make it so. 65-0426, Proving His Word, Embassy Hotel, Los Angeles, CA, 123 min

L-326 You believe, sir? [The brother says, "Amen."--Ed.]

L-327 Dear Heavenly Father, upon the confession of his faith and believing, I lay my hands upon him, in Jesus Christ's Name, for his healing.

L-328 Dear God, I lay my hands upon this woman, in the Name of Jesus Christ, for her healing. All right.

L-329 Dear Father, I lay my hands upon this woman, in the Name of Jesus Christ, for her healing. You said, "She shall recover."

L-330 Ready for healing, sister?

L-331 Dear God, I lay my hands upon her, in the Name of Jesus Christ, that You'll heal her.

L-332 All right, sister, dear, everything ready for healing? Your faith has now been met, you believe you're going to be well?

L-333 And, God, I lay my hands upon her, in obeying Your commandment, "To all the world, every creature." I lay hands upon her, in Jesus' Name, for her healing.

L-334 Dear God, I lay my hands upon my brother, in the Name of Jesus Christ, for his healing.

L-335 Dear God, I lay my hands upon my sister, in the Name of Jesus Christ, for her healing.

L-336 [Blank.spot.on.tape--Ed.]... going down the aisle. I just didn't want to weary you. You'll be alright if you'll believe that now.

L-337 Dear God, I pray that You'll heal my sister, in the Name of Jesus Christ. Amen.

L-338 [Blank.spot.on.tape--Ed.]... to help me pray for these people.

L-339 Now we got some handkerchiefs here, and so forth, in here, to be prayed over. And I want you to continue to pray with me now, now, these little parcels, now. I know this sounds very strange for people to pray over a little thing like this. But if you could only come into my office, once, and just watch. If we had kept testimonies through these years, I suppose you couldn't have piled on this platform, that's been healed just by sending out these prayer cloths like this, millions of them, around and around the world. Now, you know what it is--it is?

L-340 Somebody get that handkerchief there for that--that young... You'll know your handkerchief, will you, brother? All right.

L-341 And I have seen little, crippled children healed. And you see, what it is, it's just a point of contact, as Oral Roberts used to say. It's just a point of contact. We pray. Now, we don't do this ourselves, we do this because the Bible commissions us to do this. We all know that's true.

L-342 Now, there is many people that they anoint handkerchiefs, and so forth. Well, now, we think that's all right, sure, but if we just... The Bible didn't say that they "anointed" handkerchiefs.

L-343 "But they took from the body of Paul handkerchiefs." Now see what I was talking about? Now, what they seen, that quickening power that was in Paul, that they knew he was God's servant. They knowed that God was in him. They knowed that everything that he touched was blessed. How many understands that? Say, "Amen." [Congregation says, "Amen."--Ed.] [Acts 19:12]

L-344 You know, I think Paul was quite Scriptural in what he done. Don't you think so? You want me to tell you where I think he got the idea of doing it? [Someone says, "From Elisha."--Ed.] From Elisha, is right. See, Elijah said, "Take this staff and go lay it on the baby." And the prophet sent the staff because he knowed that everything that he touched was blessed. He knew his position. He... if he could just get the woman to believe the same thing.

L-345 Now see, now, the Bible never even said, "They shall pray for the sick." It said, "They shall lay hands on the sick." [Mark 16:18]

L-346 Now just think, the people seen, in the apostle Peter, the Presence of God manifested in this man, insomuch that they--they even laid the people in his shadow, and they were healed. How many knows that's Scriptural? [Congregation 65-0426, Proving His Word, Embassy Hotel, Los Angeles, CA, 123 min says, "Amen."--Ed.] That's just as much Scripture as John 3:16. See, It's all God's Word. Now, the people, you know the shadow of that man did not heal the people.

L-347 But, look, if the power of God was upon that prophet, for years and years after he died, insomuch that a dead man was throwed on his body, his bones. The body wasn't even there; the bones was there. And the Presence of God was upon those bones, until that dead man come to life.

L-348 Now don't you know that that same God that did all those things is right here tonight? To--to me, I think we should be the most happiest people in all the world. Just think of this.

L-349 I--I hope that I haven't impressed my audience to believe that it's something that I do myself. You--you know better than that. I, I am your brother, see, and I am just your brother.

L-350 But I do know, I do know this, that God is here. And I know that He has given something to us, that we cannot explain it, only by the Word of God, claims that it should be here at this time. So, it also gives us identification to know that we're living in the last days. It gives us identification to know that this people, this chosen, elected, called-out, predestinated...

L-351 Now, that's a big word, predestinate, but we all know that it's the truth. We absolutely know that the infinite God predestinated all things by foreknowledge before the foundation of the world, even the Lamb was slain; and every name that would ever be on the Book, was put on the Book before the Book was ever written. Now how many knows that's true? [Congregation says, "Amen."--Ed.]

L-352 And Jesus came to--to redeem those that were in the Book. In the Bible, the Lamb came from behind the curtain, and taken the Book and opened the Seals that It was sealed with, for He came to claim all He had redeemed. He's the Intercessor now, an Intercessor making intercessions for those who He has redeemed. All whose name was written on the Lamb's Book of Life, is redeemed.

L-353 As I made a crude little statement the other night... I'm waiting for you all to get these handkerchiefs here. I'm not just trying to preach over again, but I said there was a little statement... I hope this don't sound sacrilegious, see. But like the farmer that set the hen, and didn't have enough eggs, so he got an eagle egg, and he set it under the hen and she hatched out an eagle. And he was a very odd fellow amongst all the chickens, because they didn't see things alike. But that's all he ever seen, was the hen. He only heard one voice, it didn't sound like his voice. Neither could he make a voice like the hen or the chicken. He didn't appreciate their diet, as they eat from the barnyard. There was something different about him, yet he didn't know what the difference was.

L-354 And then one day, there was the mother eagle that knowed she had layed so many eggs. And there was one of those eggs, which was to be her son, was missing. So she went hunting for him, and she found him in the barnyard. And she screamed. And when she screamed, the little eagle knew the voice of the mother. As Jesus said, "My sheep know My Voice."

L-355 I think, last night, when I seen that panel of Baptists, Presbyterian, and whatmore, they might have been brought out under a hen. Excuse me, brother, see. But Mother knew She had Her darlings out there somewhere. So them men standing there, not disputing the feeding they had got from the mother hen, and so forth, but now they're eagles, you see, they fly for their food. See?

L-356 And I think the church is something like a scene I seen not long ago, coming down from Tucson, or from--from Phoenix, going to Tucson. I saw a mysterious sight. And it kind of broke my heart, to see what had taken place, how... a hawk, that used to fly in the air, a brother to the eagle, which is a type of the church.

L-357 And Jehovah is the Eagle. He called His prophets "eagles." He called Himself, Jehovah, "Eagle."

L-358 But this hawk has long lost its identification, because it doesn't no more sail through the air and hunt its meat like it's supposed to. But it sits on the telephone wires and acts like a scavenger. He--he hunts for dead rabbits that the cars has killed, and him and the vultures get out there and eat together. He hops like a vulture, instead of walking like he should walk. He has lost his identification. 65-0426, Proving His Word, Embassy Hotel, Los Angeles, CA, 123 min

L-359 And I say this with all godly love and respect, the church has long lost her identification as a sister eagle. She sits around. Instead of digging into the Word and find whether these things are right, she waits for a bunch of Sunday school literature that's been made up by a bunch of intellectuals somewhere, some dead rabbit that's been killed somewhere else. Hops like a vulture! God help us to fly away from that.

L-360 These promises are true. Not what somebody said about It, but what God said about them! They are true. I'm so glad to be associated with eagles. Let us pray together for our sick ones.

L-361 Dear Heavenly Father, it is taught in the Bible that they taken from the body of Paul, handkerchiefs and aprons, and demons went out of people, and unclean spirits left them. Now, Father, me standing here over these handkerchiefs, represents every person that's present. It's the Body of Christ, us together. We are claiming, by grace and love, that we are here to represent His Bride, and believing, associate with Him in His Kingdom. And we know we're not Saint Paul, but we know You're still Jesus.

L-362 And we pray that You will honor the faith of these people. If they had lived back in the days of Paul, they'd have heard this same Gospel, seen these same things. Therefore, they're the same kind of people. You're the same God. So I pray, Dear God, that You'll honor their faith, like You did those in the Bible days. And may every demon power, every sickness, every affliction, that's bound the people that these handkerchiefs and parcels here represent, may that evil power of sickness leave them.

L-363 It was said, one time, that Israel was walking in the line of duty, to a promised land. And right in the line of duty, the enemy come and backed them up in a corner, and the Red Sea cut them off from the line of duty, and in their march. And God looked down from the heavens, through the Pillar of Fire, and the sea got scared. It rolled back its waves, because God's waves was in the bottom of the sea. And It made way for His children, walking in the line of obedience.

L-364 Now, God, if the Red Sea would get scared, and roll back its waves, roll back its waters, and give place to a journeying children marching in obedience; Dear God, tonight, look down through the Blood of Your Son, Jesus, Who made the promise. And when these handkerchiefs are placed upon the sick bodies of the people, may the eyes of God look, and may that sickness, that devil, be scared and move away. And may the people keep the journey to the promised Land, with good health and strength. As Israel marched through the wilderness, there wasn't one feeble person among them, at the other end. May it be granted to these people, Father, for we send these handkerchiefs, in Jesus Christ's Name. Amen.

L-365 God bless you, each one. As you get your handkerchiefs now, you believe with all your heart. Do you believe that God hears this? [Congregation says, "Amen."--Ed.] See? I, I want to say this. Don't, don't doubt, one bit. See, it may seem real strange. Excuse me, just a minute. Don't doubt, one bit. But believe now that, what we have asked, God gives.

L-366 Do you believe that's God here, knows the secret of your heart? You know and believe that's God? [Congregation says, "Amen."--Ed.] Now just settle your mind now, it can't be nothing else. See?

L-367 Now, what if there would be a great tomorrow, way years ago this will be history. And when people, in years to come, if it was to be such, they'd come and say, "Well, if I would have been living then, I'd seen that done, boy, that's all I would have had to know. I'd have believed it right then!" See, the same thing that you believe, if you had been back there when they done it then! Remember, it's still Him. It's His Life in you. God bless you.
