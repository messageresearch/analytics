There's not been one pass this platform the eight nights that I've been here that I know of, but what's delivered.

[Brother Branham steps away from the microphone to pray for the people and another brother says, "Everyone pray, as Brother Branham goes along these cot cases and wheelchair cases...?..."--Ed.]

L-10 You have quite a bit of faith of the people on the cots and the wheelchairs and so forth...?... Trying to check over these people just a moment, down here in front. Sister, you there in the wheelchair, what do you think? You going to be healed tonight? Here, you believe you're going to be healed tonight? I--I know...?... my question, sure about...

L-12 Are your heads bowed...?... you accept it. I won't stop...?... How long have you been afflicted? Nine years, will you accept Him? You will? Do you think now that if I lay hands on you, that Christ will make you well? Is that right? This lady comes through, something stopped me really right quick, bound her back and her throat. And she says...?... cancer here, so, we're going to ask God, at this time. I think friends, that we ought to have the right-of-way night, that where ever the Lord will take us, stop at the people, and deliver them right here at the platform.

L-13 Don't you think that they got that much faith? [A brother speaks--Ed.]...?... the microphone now, and the Lord will deliver. Then if you go through this line, if you feel like that you're not healed and want to come through another line, you're welcome to come. Now I want you to believe. I want you to believe it...?...

Thou deaf and dumb come out of the woman in the Name of Jesus Christ, the Son of God.

L-15 You that wheeled her up, have her to look at me...?... By the way, she has crossed-eyes. Almighty God, the Author of Life, and the Giver of every good gift, send Thy blessings upon this girl. It's the same spirit, believing that Thou art able to do this Lord, we... [Blank.spot.on.tape--Ed.] Father, I pray...?... thou demon leave her, in Jesus Christ's Name...?... Now, while you have you're heads bowed, how many remember last night what I said about a deaf and dumb spirit, when it's bound down, like a--a... just like a transparent band around the hand? You remember that, say "Amen." That's what...?... are made of. This woman maybe never spoke to her in her life, she'd know nothing about it. Now I'd just 48-0000, Prayer Line, Unknown, no audio have to...?... Everybody be praying. Don't be...don't be upset, think you're not going to get prayed tonight. I want to...?... early, and then she can go home and be healed, and be well...?...

God grant it...?... medical science...?... [Blank.spot.on.tape--Ed.] Heavenly Father, as I stand here tonight holding this hand. Take this minister to the needy, the sick and the afflicted. I'm thinking of that...?... physician, Luke, that was with thy disciple. And our brother's arm has been paralyzed Lord, and realizing that there's nothing can help him, except God be merciful. Therefore Father, I'm asking with the sincerity of my heart that this man's arm may be restored. May feeling begin to creep into that arm, then may he be able to minister again to the sick and the afflicted. I ask this blessing for the Glory of God, in the Name of Jesus Christ. Amen.

I believe Doctor, as certain as I'm standing on the platform tonight, you're going back...?... You're going right back to work. Almighty God, I pray Thee to be merciful Lord, to this poor girl, standing here with this stiff neck, can't turn her head, has to turn her whole body...?... I pray that You'll be merciful and heal her. May the power of the devil that bound this child, loose her in Jesus Christ's Name. Now turn your head back this way, now turn your head this way. There you are! Now, that's fine, believe it? Now you can raise your head. Look this way honey, look over here to me. Look over here, there you are. Now look back that way...?...

[Blank.spot.on.tape--Ed.] Have the ministers to line up here to be praying for these people as they pass down the platform, if you believe, everyone...?... In the Name of the Lord Jesus. Everyone being prayed for now, as you go through the line. Remember the other night when I asked that lady to go sit down. The second night she was back here to testify. How many still remembers that say, "Amen." The lady's in the building now with the baby, and about forty-eight hours after she'd been prayed for, the eyes of the baby come straight. So will you, as you pass through here. Just believe. [Blank.spot.on.tape--Ed.]...?... [Blank.spot.on.tape--Ed.]

L-21 Father, be merciful to this boy, wearing a vest with buttons. I pray God, that You'll heal him. Give him perfect hearing in his... back Lord. I ask Thee to be merciful to this boy. Thou spirit of infirmity, deafness that's going to try to cause this boy to be deaf and walk before a vehicle and be killed. I adjure thee leave the boy, in the Name of Jesus Christ. Come out of him. Just be reverent now, just a little bit now. Vibrations still hitting his hand, that deaf spirit...?... Almighty God, have mercy upon my brother.

L-25 Do you believe that He sent me to do this? You'll notify your people of the great power of God. God bless you, everybody bow your heads...?... Almighty God, Your commission by the Son of God was "Go into all the world and preach the Gospel." And we know that the Gospel is power and demonstration of the Holy Spirit. And here's a lady coming from a...?... where Paul taught so many things. And I believe Father, that You're here tonight. You're among all people just as You were with Paul, back in the days of her forefathers, just the people has come on down this age. Thou knowest how that we're planning by Your grace to go shortly. Now the woman's setting watching the line pass through right here of the sick and afflicted, blind and halt. Seeing that tonight Satan is trying his best to hold, but he's losing ground. You're winning, Lord. Now we know that you're here, then the people might know that You are near with us. I am the servant, Lord. God, I've left home, and all that's dear to me on this earth to follow You. It's such a privilege I have of doing this. [Blank.spot.on.tape--Ed.]...?...

L-26 Just now, through Jesus Christ, by a gift of healing that was ministered to me by an Angel. You come out of the woman, in the Name of the Son of God, Jesus Christ. Every vibration stopped. Just hold your head...?... Fear not sister, swallow that swallow of water in the Name of Lord Jesus. There she is, drinking the glass of water. She swallow it all right? Oh, come back on you? Pour that glass of water out, get me another. Lady, if I stand here till day break, the devil's going to turn your throat loose. The rest of you hold your peace...?... I believe that, I believe you're going to swallow that water...?... mouth, it comes right back...?... you about it, is that right? All right, may every person's head be bowed, and every eye closed. And I pray...?... [Blank.spot.on.tape--Ed.]

L-27 Come out from the woman, in the Name of Jesus Christ, I adjure thee. You might as well go. We're staying right here until you leave. So leave her in the Name of the Son of God, Jesus Christ. And not one head move. Now...?... All right, He remains the Son of God. Thou demon, leave the woman. Yes, Lord. See, when I put my hands on you it opens up. Everyone believe...?... I'm believing. I know that God is here to deliver...?... Keep my hands on, that's what works...?... in the power of faith. See, the laying on of hands. God grant it. That one went down and stayed down. [Blank.spot.on.tape--Ed.]...?... That one went too, didn't it? So you can hear the microphone, that one went too, didn't it sir? Keep your heads bowed. Two drinks of water, keep taking it...?... time go along now, three years, two years.
