--- TRANSCRIPT ---

L-1 Was he next to the platform tonight now? All right, you ready? Good evening, friends. So happy to be here tonight to serve the Lord Jesus. We are trusting that God will pour out His blessings upon us tonight. It made my heart feel real jumping, when I heard that "Only Believe" in German. A--a friend of mine wrote that song; his name is Paul Rader. Years ago he went to be with the Lord. And when he was dying, he was in Los Angeles, California. And they had him in the hospital. And wh--when he started to die, they had the curtains pulled down and was singing real mournful songs. He had quite a sense of humor; he...?... he said, "Say, who's dying here, me or you?" Said, "Raise up them curtains and sing me some real good snappy Gospel songs." And they begin to sing, "Down at the cross where the Saviour died." He said, "That sounds better." He said, "Where is my brother, Luke?" And they said, "In the next room." He said, "Bring him here." And he took ahold of Luke's hand, and he said, "Brother, we've come a long ways together. We've been missionaries throughout the world. But think of it, brother, in five minutes from now, I'll be standing in the Presence of Jesus Christ, clothed in His righteousness." And squeezed his brother's hands and went to meet God. That's the way I want to go: clothed in His righteousness, not our own; it--it won't work. But in His, God has already accepted Him. So if He's acc--already accepted Him, and He has accepted me, then I won't have to stand in my own. I stand in His, already accepted. Amen. I like that. He gives life.

L-2 Now, we have decided of--of these instruction services, before we have prayer line, so that the people can thoroughly be instructed, that when the healing does start, then the people will understand the approach to God. We're living in a day when there's much mu--make-believe. And right and wrong is trying to join themselves together, or people is trying to join right and wrong together, rather. It can never be done. Uh-huh. One is of the devil, and the other one is of God. The devil is wrong, and God is right. And it'll always be that way. The devil will lose and God will always win. So if--if you are wrong, you're on the wrong side. You're sure to lose. If you're on the right side, you're on God's side, and you're sure to win; you can't lose.

L-3 Now, God's plan is laid out in His Bible. And this is what we must go by. It must come from His Word, because my words will fail; I'm a man. But God's Word can't fail, because it's God. Now, the ministry that I am to introduce to you will be very stunning at first. But let's see first. That's what I want to get to you first, that it's a--a message from God, from His Word to His children. It hasn't been in practice (hasn't been practiced) since the days of the apostles. In the early days of the church they had these things in the church. And they kept fading out. And then they kept getting dimmer and dimmer. And after a while, it went all out. Miracles and signs left the church. But the prophet said that there would be a day that it would neither be dark or light, but he said, "In the evening time, it shall be light."

L-4 When the early church come in in the Orients, the East, it was in Jerusalem, the east. The sun rises in the east and it goes westward. Civilization has traveled the same way: from the east going west. All through these two thousand years it's called the church age. It neither has been dark or light. We've had enough light to believe that Jesus was the Son of God; He saves the sinner. But it--we haven't had the light on the miracles and signs like they had at the east at the beginning. But we're at the end time. The sun is setting on civilization. The prophet promised that the sun would shine again in the last--in the evening. The same sun that shined at the beginning at Jerusalem, shall shine again at the end time. The things that was once in the church at the beginning will be restored again at the end time. We're living in that time. If it was puzzling to the people in that day, how much more will it be in this day. But, my friend, God's Gospel must be preached. He will send it regardless of what people say. You could not stop it; it's like fighting a--a fire in a high wind...?... God will shine forth His light. He's doing it just before the coming of the Lord Jesus. It's not man; man is out of it. It's God. God does it because He promised it. 55-0813, Fellowship, Unknown, Karlsruhe, Germany, 87 min

L-5 The reason today, that Christianity is in about the fifth place among the religions, when it comes to numbers, is because we have failed to do what Jesus commanded us to do. The last words that Jesus Christ gave to His church was to "Go into all the world and preach the Gospel to every creature." Instead of that, we have went and taught the Bible. Well, the Gospel doesn't mean the Word only. Paul said, "The Gospel came not in word only, but in power and manifestation of the Holy Ghost." The Word is a Seed, but the Seed won't grow unless it's placed in the right kind of ground. No matter how much seed you got, if you're afraid to sow it ...(afraid to sow--afraid)... the seed will do you no good. But listen to this: every Word of God is a Seed. Jesus said so. And every promise of God will come to pass if you will receive it and don't doubt it, can place it in your heart, and believe it come from God, and water it with faith, it'll spring forth of its kind. Don't never forget this statement. I make this from my heart. The right mental attitude towards any promise of God will bring it to pass. You believe that? ...?... Amen. If you'll take the right attitude, that it's God's Word, and God is behind His Word, and the Word is God, it'll bring to pass what it says. If you plant wheat, you get wheat. If you plant corn, you get corn. If you want to be saved, accept His plan of salvation. If you want to be healed, accept His plan of healing. Here they are. He, Christ, was wounded for our transgressions; with His stripes we were healed. That's all you have to know. The next thing you have to do, is to believe it, and it'll take care of itself. Hallelujah. ...?... It will.

L-6 Now, I want to read some Scripture tonight and explain to you, the best I can, of the ministry. Mr. Bosworth was explaining this afternoon. And tomorrow afternoon, if the Lord willing, I want to speak also. Now, tomorrow night, the Lord willing, we're going to start the prayer line. We think it would be--you'll have sufficient training then. Now, all that we say, is being taken down on tape recording. And I want you to watch. And you tell others now, that I said that I am not a healer. God is the Healer. I am not against doctors, against hospitals, medical cures, because they all come from God. God has sent them to us. He sent us a horse (horse). Then He sent us a automobile. Now He sends us an airplane. It would taken me a long time to get over here on a horse. I accept what God sent. He sent an airplane. I come in twenty-four hours. I'm thankful God sent an airplane.

L-7 And all good things comes from God. What will we do if we had no doctors, had no health and hygiene, and--and had no hospitals? Wouldn't it be awful? But remember, there isn't one thi--or one dose of medicine that can heal you. There's no doctor will tell you so. I have been interviewed by some of the greatest doctors of the world. I've been to Mayo's clinics for interview... (Mayo)... And many of the fine doctors come to my home to be prayed for. So they say with a big sign; "We do not claim to be healers. There is only one Healer; that is God. We only claim to assist nature." (Assist.) So if the greatest clinic in the world said that, well, that ought to settle it. We'll get into teaching later in the week, but I want to show you how simple healing is. Perhaps, if I cut my hand with a knife... Now, listen close. There isn't a medicine in the world that can heal a knife cut. Now, just be reverent and just use your thinking. There's not a kni... not a medicine that can heal a knife cut. If a medicine was here would heal a knife cut, it would heal a knife cut in my coat. It would heal a knife cut on this desk. If it'd heal a knife cut, it'd heal a knife cut anywhere. Water that would be wet in here would be wet outside. A medicine that would heal a cut in my hand, would heal a cut in my coat.

L-8 Now, you're going to say to me, "Brother Branham, you're--you're becoming a fanatic, because medicine was not made to heal your coat. Neither was it made to heal the desk, but it was made to heal your body." Then I'll ask you one thing then. If I cut my hand and I fall down dead, I know that Germany has some of the smartest doctors in the world. Many fine doctors from America come here to be educated. You're a very smart people. But you could take me to your best clinic, and your best doctors could visit me every day, embalm my body, that would make me look natural for fifty years. And every day they could give me penicillin, sulfur drugs, sew up my hand, and fifty years from now, that cut would be just exactly like it was when it was cut here at the pulpit. Why, you say, "Sure, Brother Branham, the life is gone out of you." Well, that--that's right. Now, if medicine is the healer, it doesn't need the life. But if life is the healer, then that is God. You tell me what life is, and I'll tell you Who God is. God is Life. Medicine doesn't build tissue. It's life, and that's God. 55-0813, Fellowship, Unknown, Karlsruhe, Germany, 87 min

L-9 A doctor... If I broke my arm, I'd go to the doctor. If he's the healer, I'd say, "Heal my arm, doctor." Why, he'd look at me as if I was crazy. He'd say, "Mr. Branham, I'll set your arm." Now, if he's the healer, then I have to come out with a well arm. But he's not the healer. He just sets the bone to keep it in place while God heals it. That right? Uh-huh, yes. If I have appendicitis, ...(appendicitis)... [Someone helps with the word and Brother Branham thanks them.--Ed.] Thank you. [Brother Branham laughs--Ed.] If I have appendicitis, the doctor could cut the place out--cut the appendix out, but he--he can't heal it. He cuts a big hole in me and leaves it there for God to heal. Is that right? So medicine doesn't heal. But we're thankful for all these aids. Automobiles, airplanes, soap to wash your hands with, glasses to wear when you get old, false teeth when you--yours come out; all these things, we're thankful, because they come from God. We're appreciate them.

L-10 I want to ask you something now. Now, God is the only Healer. I want... Listen to this. We are--we've got the best doctors we ever had. They've got the best medicine the doctors ever practiced with. We got the best hospitals the world ever knowed of, the greatest clinics, the smartest doctors, and the more sickness than the world ever knew. Why? We got more sin and unbelief than the world ever knew. The people are getting away from God. They're getting... They go to church. The worst devil there is... (worst demon)... is a religious demon. That's what killed Jesus. It was the religious party that want to say He was a devil, that killed Him. That is right. So we want to watch that. Going to church and being religious has nothing to do with being born again of the Holy Spirit and become a Christian. Uh-huh. That's a different thing. Over in I John and the 1st chapter, and I believe it's the 7th verse, we read these Scriptures. All right, now you can read it, if you wish to, the 7th verse. [The interpreter reads the Scripture in German--Ed.].

L-11 The Lord bless His Word. Now, there's many people can open the Book like that, but it takes God to re--open it and reveal it. You'll never understand it by education. You'll never find it in a seminary. You'll never find it through science. You'll never find it in knowledge. In the Garden of Eden there was a tree of knowledge and a Tree of Life. As long as man eat from the Tree of Life, he had everlasting life. But the first bite he took off the tree of knowledge, he lost his soul. And every time that man takes a bite off of the tree of knowledge, he destroys himself. God destroys nothing. Man destroys himself by knowledge. God is not known by knowledge; He's known by faith. You must believe Him, not explain Him, for you can't. With childlike faith... (childlike faith)... you believe Him.

L-12 Now, God knowing by faith... When man bit his first bite, He destroyed his fellowship with God. And that's what we're going to speak on this afternoon: "Fellowship." The next bite he took, he invented gun powder: kills his brother. The next thing he--by knowledge he--he gets, an automobile: kills more people than all the wars. He just keeps biting off the tree of knowledge and leaving the Tree of Life alone. He's bit hisself an atomic bomb now. I wonder what he's going to do with that? Better come on back to God, to the Tree of Life, for this time space of life is short. But you've got to spend eternity somewhere. There's no one in the world could appreciate the fellowship of God like one who's had an experience with Him. We all like fellowship. It's a--the creature of man, he--he was made for fellowship. You don't know how I would like to take every man in here, go eat with you, set down and talk with you, talk about heaven, about Jesus. I would love to do that. Time won't permit it. But I'll make an appointment with you. When we step out of time into eternity, I want a thousand years with each one of you. And when I get through, I'll have no less time than what I did when I began. But now, it's--it's night. It's a day of man. Daylight comes, the day of the Lord. Now we must labor. I can't be the servant of man and the servant of God at the same time. I must serve God so I can win men to His Creator God, so that we can keep that appointment. Uh-huh, uh-huh.

L-13 Fellowship, wonderful thing. Now, why does men like fellowship? Why is it men like to meet with men, women meet with women? ...(Woman: frau)... We all like to meet together. The ladies meet together and sew and talk; the men go to table and they have things in common that they like to talk about. That come from somewhere. What makes you 55-0813, Fellowship, Unknown, Karlsruhe, Germany, 87 min love your children? Because you're a father. That's the strain, human strain. That's the reason it proves that we have a heavenly Father that loves we His children. All the things is now, made of things that was. The Bible said there's nothing new in the world. Now, in the beginning, when God made a man, He didn't make him to be sick. He didn't make him to have cancer. He never made him to die. He made him for fellowship. Now, in the evening when it was quiet, God came down and had fellowship with Adam and Eve. They loved God. God loved them. He didn't want them to be sick, get old, and die. He wanted to be young and lovely forever. But sin brought us here, not God, against God's will. We ourselves plunged ourself into that.

L-14 Now, Jesus came to restore the human race. Everything that he lost in Eden, and we're on our road... Now, we have the earnest of that deliverance. Now, we are--have the Holy Spirit, which is the Life of God in a portion. ...(portion, or a small part)... When we are in His Presence at--at the end of life, then we will have the full Spirit. This is called the Earnest of our salvation. Now, we also believe that we'll have a immortal body someday. When Jesus comes, these vile bodies will be changed. And we'll have a body like His own glorious body. How many believes that? Thank you. I'm happy to see you believe that. I look for that day myself. Notice, if we have that and that was included in redemption, we've got to have Divine healing for the earnest of our complete deliverance. If there is no Divine healing, there's no resurrection of the dead. How about that, teacher? If there is no Divine healing, there's no resurrection. Divine healing is the earnest of the resurrection. If the Holy Spirit is here, that is the Earnest of our eternal life. Do you believe that?

L-15 The reason that God included Divine healing, how could you take it out of the Gospel, when He was wounded for our transgressions; with His stripes we were healed? The same Blood from the same Man on the same day: one for salvation, one for healing. To deny one is to deny the other. They have just turned it around today. In the days of Jesus here on earth in a physical body, they said, "We know He can heal, but He makes hisself God by forgiving sin." Now today, they say, "He's all right. He can forgive sins, but He can't heal." But praise be to God, He can do both. I am a witness. And I'm sure there's many others here of the millions around the world too.

L-16 Now, the only way you'll ever appreciate that, and to understand it, is to come back into fellowship with God. How can the carnal mind ever understand the things of God? They are foolishness, the Bible said, to him. He can't understand it. He can't reason it out. But the born again spirit doesn't reason it. They just believe it and act on it like Abraham did. Abraham, the father of the faithful, God told him when he was sixty-five years old (I mean that was his wife was sixty-five and he was seventy-five.), that they were going to have a baby. Could you imagine that? Could you imagine a man in Germany, going down to a fine doctor to make room at the hospital, him seventy-five and his wife sixty-five? Been living with her since she was seventeen, no children yet, but God said, "You're going to have one." And Abraham believed God. No matter what science said, Abraham believed God.

L-17 Two years, no difference. Five years, no difference. Ten years, no difference. But Abraham kept saying, "Praise God, we're going to have it anyhow. God said so." That's a good reason to believe it. Uh-huh. "God said so." I can imagine he went and got the--the little napkins, and got the pins, getting everything ready, for God said. No matter how impossible, God said so. That settles it. Twenty years passed, no baby yet; but Abraham still believed God. And he got stronger. He kept giving God praise. Now, what would you do if you was prayed for tonight and--and tomorrow you wasn't well? You'd say, "There's nothing to it." That shows you need to be born again. Abraham's children, which we are--only Abraham's children has the blessing. We, being dead in Christ, take on Abraham's seed and are heirs according to the promise. That gives every believer that's been born again, the same faith that Abraham had to call what God said to be the truth and to call what you see with your eyes, if it's contrary to God's promise, to be a lie. Amen. Now, you... We don't go by sight. ...(By sight, we don't walk by sight.)... We--we don't walk by sight or we don't go by feelings. We go by God's Word. No matter what the outside looks like, we believe it. 55-0813, Fellowship, Unknown, Karlsruhe, Germany, 87 min

L-18 And when Abraham was a hundred years old, twenty-five years later, Sarah was ninety, God gave them the baby. Hallelujah. Why? Because he believed God, and called the things that was contrary to the Word, he refused to look at it. He refused to know his own body was dead. He did not consider the deadness of Sarah's womb. The...?... The Bible said, "He staggered not that the pro--at the promise of God through unbelief, but was strong, giving praise to God, knowing without a shadow of doubt, that God would--could keep what He had promised." I believe the same. Do you? Amen. Then you can have what you ask.

L-19 I met a man, here the other day. He said, "Brother Branham, I don't believe that. I don't care what happens." I said, "Certainly not. It wasn't made for unbelievers. It was only for those who believe." Unbelievers can receive nothing. The believer can have what he asks for. Jesus said so. Now, if you can come back in fellowship, get all the carnal out of your mind, all the things that reasons against the Word, and say, "God, You're able to keep what You promised. I believe it, and it's mine through Jesus Christ's death at the cross. And I now accept it. And that settles it." Just go right on thanking Him for it, and God will bring it to pass.

L-20 How many Christians are in here? Would you raise up your hand? Thank you. Wonderful. Now, how did you accept Christ? You say, "I was saved ten years ago." Or maybe, "I was saved a year ago." No, you were saved nineteen hundred years ago when Jesus died. Then you have to accept it now. And when you accept it, it isn't necessary for you to feel like--feel anything. When you went out of the church, the--the unbelieving crowd said, "There's no difference in you. Your eyes are still the same color. You're still wearing that same suit. There's no difference." And there's nothing you can show him that there's any difference. But here it is. You believed there was a difference. Why? God promised different. It'd gone to work on the inside. It'll show on the outside pretty soon. But you raised up; accept Him as your personal Saviour. Then you go out. No matter what the unbeliever says, you say, "I'm a Christian." You talk like a Christian. You act like a Christian. You associate with Christians, and you believe you're a Christian. And you make all the actions of a Christian. What does it do for you? It makes you a Christian. Why? He was wounded for your transgressions.

L-21 How do you accept Christ for healing? The very same way. You meet His pro--His conditions. Put His Word in your heart, walk out of the building, say, "I'm healed." Say, "I don't see no difference." They say, "Well, you don't look any different than you did." No matter what they say, it's what you believe. Just as sure as He was wounded for your transgressions, with His stripes you were healed. The same atonement, same day. Amen. and He's the same yesterday, today, and forever. You believe it? Uh-huh. Right. That's the way to receive it. Now, God wrote it in His Word; that should be sufficient. If it was my word, or your word, and people wouldn't take it, I'd say, "Let them go." But not God. God's not willing that any should perish. Then He sends teachers, apostles, prophets, and different gifts into the church. What to do? To scatter the church? No, but to draw the church together for the perfecting of the body of Jesus Christ. He's coming soon, and if He--if He had a body in the beginning back there with all the signs and wonders in it, the body He comes for will have to be the same kind of body, or it would be a freak body.

L-22 Now, in the Old Testament, in making a covenant, here's how they made a covenant. That's a great thing. Now, in America, when we make a covenant, we promise one another something, and then we shake one another's hand. That seals the covenant. And in Japan, when they make a covenant, they make it between each other, and then they get a little box of salt, and they throw salt on one another. That's a covenant. In--in the Bible days, back in the days when God made His covenant with Abraham...?... showed what He was going to do in the end time...?... Here's what they did. They took an animal. Well, the first thing they did, they--they took a piece of paper, or they took a scr--a script or some sort, it's a skin. And they wrote out the covenant. And then the next thing they did was they kill an animal. They cut the animal in two. And then they stood between this dead animal. And they took a cup, pledged one with another: If they didn't keep this covenant, let their bodies be like the dead body of the animal. Then they tore the covenant apart; give one to one and one to another. 55-0813, Fellowship, Unknown, Karlsruhe, Germany, 87 min

L-23 Now, when the day of the promise was fulfilled, he must bring the same piece that tore off of here. It must dovetail together to make it the same. When God made a covenant with the church, He took Jesus to Calvary and there, nailed to a cross, He tore Him apart. He tore His soul and body apart. He lifted up His body, set on His right hand in heaven, and He sent the Holy Ghost back to the church. And when we come to meet that body, we've got to have the same Spirit that was upon Christ, has got to be on us, or it won't dovetail with the body. Hallelujah. The same Holy Spirit was in you, was in Christ. He said, "A little while and the world won't see Me no more." That's the unbeliever. "Yet you shall see Me, for I ('I' is a personal pronoun.), I will be with you, even to the end of the world."

L-24 If I told you the spirit of a painter was in me, you'd expect me to paint the picture like a painter. If I told you the spirit of a criminal was in me... (yes some bad men)..., you'd expect me to have big guns. I'd be dangerous to be around. So the spirit of a criminal would be in me. And if the church says that the Spirit of Christ is in them, then Christ will do the works in His church that He did when He was here on earth; for He is the same yesterday, today, and forever. He said a... Amen. He said, "A little while and the unbelievers will see Me no more, yet ye shall see Me." Now, there's going to be unbelievers to the end of the world. And there's going to be "Ye's" ...(Ye--Ye. You see?)... ye to the end of the world. ...(Ye, the believers.)... Aren't you glad you're a "ye"? God has promised. I believe Jesus Christ the Son of God was born of the virgin Mary. I believe that Almighty God overshadowed the virgin Mary and created a blood cell that formed the Son of God. Do you believe that? That's the only way that you can be saved. Today when people say, "Oh, He was just a prophet, he was a good man," that's wrong. He was Divine. He was God manifested in flesh.

L-25 You... Recently, a Christian Science woman, that--she said, "Reverend Branham, you put too much emphasis on Christ. You make him divine. He wasn't divine," she said. "He was a good man. He was a teacher and a prophet, but He wasn't divine." I said, "He was either God or the greatest deceiver the world ever had." I said, "Do you..." She said, "If I'll prove to you by the Bible (You said you was a fundamentalist.), that He was only a man, will you accept it?" I said, "If the Bible says He was just a man and wasn't Divine, I would believe it. But the Bible doesn't say so." She said, "I can prove it." I said, "Go ahead." And she said, "You know in St. John 11," said, "when Jesus was going to the grave of Lazarus, why, the Bible said he wept. Why," she said, "that proves that he was only a man," said, "because He could cry." That's the way with the carnal mind; they don't see the supernatural. I said, "Lady, your--your argument's too thin. When He went down to the grave, He wept like a man. He wept like a man. But when He called a man that had been dead four days and laying in a grave, and a man had been dead four days stood on his feet and lived again, that was more than a man. That was God." See?

L-26 When He come down off the mountain, He was hungry like a man. He was looking over a tree for something to eat. That was a man that was hungry. But when He taken five loaves and two little fishes and fed five thousand, that was more than a man; that was God. He was a man when He was laying in that ship that night, so tired that the big waves didn't wake Him up. I believe ten thousand devils of the sea swore to drowned Him. He was... That little old boat was tossed around like a stopper, like a--a piece of cork on the water. The devil said, "I got him now." He was a man laying there asleep. But when He woke up, put His foot upon the brail of the boat, looked up towards heaven, He said, "Peace--peace be still," and the winds and the waves obeyed Him, that's more than a man; that was God. Amen. When He died at Calvary, He screamed for help. That was a man. But when He rose up Easter morning, that proved He was God. Amen. And He's alive tonight, He's the--the same Lord Jesus. Praise be to His holy Name. You say, "Brother Branham, you're excited." You get born again; you feel the same way. Oh, it's wonderful: 55-0813, Fellowship, Unknown, Karlsruhe, Germany, 87 min everlasting life. How I thank Him to see Him moving, do great signs and wonders. All the cold and different religions of Buddha and a--all those other religions failed in His Presence. He is the One Who raised from the dead and lives the same and does the same. He gave His Blood that you might have fellowship with Him, you live in His Presence.

L-27 Now, listen as I close. When man lost his fellowship in the garden of Eden by sin, what did God do about it? Look what man done about it. Instead of coming out and being honest, and saying, "Father, I sinned," he went back in the bushes, and formed himself a religious organization, and made hisself a covering. "Religion" means "a covering." He made hisself a man-made religion, made him a apron out of leaves, fig leaves. The Bible said so. But when he come to face God, he--he realized that his man-made religion wouldn't work. And neither will anybody else's. You've got to come on God's basis. What did God do? He went out and killed some animals, and shed blood, and brought back some skins to make aprons that they could stand in His Presence. Now, listen close. The only way that God can bring you back to fellowship with Him, something had to die in your place. And Jesus Christ did that to redeem you from the curse.

L-28 Now, listen close. Blood was God's welcome mat at the door. ...(welcome at the door, welcome...?...)... Now notice, just before we close. God introduced blood for the welcome back to fellowship. We have tried to adopt ...(take place)... education. We've tried denominations, organizations, and everything, but it'll never take the place of blood. Now, the only way that God in the Old Testament would receive the children of Israel, was under the blood of a sh--of a dead lamb. Now, the--the worshipper brought his lamb to the altar, and then he brought a turtledove if he was sick: the shedding of blood. Now, they had to lay their hand upon the head of the lamb. The priest cut its throat, and the little lamb started kicking and dying. It was bleating and was crying. And his hands was all bathed over with blood. His little white wool was all bathed with blood. And the sinner knew that that should be him, but the lamb was taking his place. God accepted it. Now, that lasted for so long.

L-29 But when the sinner went out, if he'd went out, or come in, confessed his sins of stealing, he went out to steal some more. If he had lived immoral, he went out to do it again. Why? The life that was in that blood cell... See, the life comes from the male. See? The baby, your blood is from your father, not your mother. You have no blood of your mother. See? It all comes from the father. That's the reason the Blood of Jesus had to come from God the Father, not sexually, for God is a Spirit, He created a holy Blood and the germ of life is in that Blood cell. Now, when the animal died, and the life went out of the blood cell, it could not come back to the human being, for it had no soul. So the sinner went out with the same desire to sin, and sin means un--disbelieve. He went back out with the same desire that he come in with.

L-30 But when Jesus died, and we lay our hands upon Him in faith and--and see His suffering yonder at Calvary, we see Him dying, and in our hearts, that we know we're sinners, and should have took His place, but He took our place... And when we accept that Blood, God raised us through the washing of the Blood, then the Spirit, the Life that was in the Blood cell of Jesus Christ, which is the Holy Ghost, turns back to the human being. After coming through the Blood into the Presence of God, and we're baptized with the Holy Spirit Itself, and the faith that God has, which made all things without anything, that's in the believer. No wonder people can't believe. They've never been born again. They're still carnal.

L-31 What did God make the world out of? Where did the--the dirt that you're setting over tonight, where did it come from? It is the Word of God made manifest. If it isn't, where did He get it? ...(Where did He find it? Where did He get the stuff to make it...?...?)... Why? He spoke His Word, and He believed His own Word, and it formed the earth. Do you believe it? Amen. Then isn't it easy with that Spirit that's in God, that's in you, you believe God can do anything and will keep His Word (Hallelujah.); 'cause you're born again. The life that was in Christ is in you. But if you just belong to church, and never born again, you'll reason. Then you'll never know God until His Spirit, through His Blood, comes into your heart, then you're a new creature. Jesus said, "Except a man be born again, he will in no wise enter into heaven."

L-32 Look at Adam and Eve with the bloody sheepskins around them. There stood a beautiful woman, the prettiest 55-0813, Fellowship, Unknown, Karlsruhe, Germany, 87 min woman in the--ever in the world. No sin had marred her. She was perfect: beautiful blue eyes, her blond hair hanging down her back, the most beautiful woman in the world. I seen a picture in Rome, here not long ago, where a man had painted a picture of Adam and Eve: the most hideous looking beast I ever seen. ...(ugliest looking, bad looking beast)... Eve--Eve with one big ear, one little ear, and one leg so big and the other one so big, and--and Adam like a beast with hairs out his nose like that, that goes to show what the unconverted heart will think about God. They were perfect, beautiful, wonderful, and there they stood. And after sinning, there they stood in the Presence of God, wrapped up in bloody sheepskins. God said, "Depart out of My Presence." And I can see them going. I can see Eve; see her lay her little head over on Adam's shoulder, saying, "Adam, it's my fault. I was the one who did it." But Adam so loved his wife that he--he wasn't--he wasn't deceived, but he loved her so well that he walked out with her: a perfect type of Jesus Christ Who knowed no sin, but came to the world, and taken the sin of His wife, the church, and walked to death with her. Hallelujah.

L-33 Listen at them. There they go. There's all the great Jehovah looking at them. There's goes His son. There goes His daughter. I hear something going like this. [Brother Branham makes a clapping, slapping sound.--Ed.] What is it? It's the bloody sheepskin beating against Adam's legs. He said, "Wait a minute. I, I will put enmity between the woman's seed and the serpent's seed." What was He promising? What was He promising? Promising a Redeemer. Now, look this way just a minute. Let's move our camera, Four thousand years later we're standing in Jerusalem. It's a terrible day. The sun looks funny. There's a funny feeling over everybody. What's the matter? Let's go to the window. Let's pull the curtains back. I hear something coming. What is it? An old rugged cross, beating up and down on the cobblestone rocks. I see a little weakly looking Guy coming. He's got a cross on His shoulder. He's got a crown of thorns on His head. He's pulling along. The old cross is dragging out the bloody footprints. He's going towards Calvary. Look on His back, just look a minute. Look by faith. I see some little red spots on His coat, all over His robe. That was from His stripes, where you're healed.

L-34 I see Him going up the--hill yonder. Look. Those little spots are becoming bigger. After while, they all run into one big spot. I hear something else. Listen. [Brother Branham claps--Ed.] What is it? The blood of Jesus Christ, the Son of God, the second Adam, going to Calvary to make a way that I could be saved, you can be saved, and I can be healed and you can be healed. I see the--as He goes, as He staggers along, tears are running down His cheeks. He came to His own; His own received Him not. His own church was crucifying Him. And they're doing the same thing today. They done it ignorantly. And so are they doing it today. He staggered along. And after while, I can see, as it was, a bee of death, stinging around Him. After while it was taking. You know a bee, an insect, they have stingers. But when a bee ever stings you deep, he can't sting no more. He pulls his stinger out. That's what God was made flesh among us for. Going up to Calvary, death stung Him. But He pulled the stinger out of death so we can stand like Paul at the end of our life to say, "O death, where is your sting? O grave, where is thy victory? But thanks be to God Who gives us the victory through our Lord Jesus Christ." Amen. Hallelujah.

L-35 Your Saviour, that saved me; and me, even me, a miserable wretch. Ten years ago, laying on a bed, and the doctor said, "You've got three more minutes to live." And I was blind in both eyes. And today I got perfect sight, and I'm heavy and strong and healthy. It's the amazing grace of my Lord Jesus Christ, and I love Him with all my heart. Some glorious day, I expect to see Him and stand in His Presence, redeemed by His grace. And every mortal in here, I'll stand in your presence with Him. This same old Gospel that saved me and healed me, it'll take me there. I'll have the same testimony tonight; I'll have it there again: by grace He saved me and healed me. Do you love Him? Say, "Amen." Shall we pray.

L-36 O dear God, I love Thee. Thou art my Saviour, and I want everyone to love You. We have come to this lovely people to fellowship with them around Thy Word and Thy blessings. And I am trying to say to them that after I'm gone, if someone tries to take it from their heart, may they be able, by the Word of God, to stand. O great God, send this week a great sweeping revival. May it cause all churches to break down their differences. May 55-0813, Fellowship, Unknown, Karlsruhe, Germany, 87 min they come with tears. And O Lord, stretch forth the hand of Thy holy Son to heal and to show signs and wonders, that He has risen from the dead and He lives today. Forgive us of our sins and fill us with the Holy Ghost, and may this place become anointed with the Holy Ghost, that every person that comes under the tent, or around the tent, they get under conviction and come to Christ. And may an old fashion revival sweep through Germany, oh, that'll make such a great change, and will make this lovely people, that's tore up and broke up, may they be united with God; that someday we may all meet together in glory; for we ask it in Jesus' Name.

L-37 And while we have our heads bowed, I wonder if there's a sinner here tonight that doesn't know the Lord Jesus? Before you see any miracles performed, and you believe that God's Word is the truth, and you realize you've mistreated Jesus, and you want to become a Christian to start serving the Lord right now? And you would like to accept Him, and you would like for me to pray for you, that you'd be a faithful Christian? If He hears my prayer to open the eyes of the blind, to make the cripples to walk, and to heal the sick through prayer, don't you believe He'll hear for your soul, in doing so? Now, will you do this for me? While you bow your head, and be in prayer, would you just raise up your hand to God, and--and say, "Lord, have mercy on me a sinner. I want to accept Jesus now." Oh my. Dozens of hands everywhere. Oh, God bless you. Shall we continue to pray.

L-38 Oh, dear heavenly Father, You see Your children. They hear Your Word. They're tired of life, of not living for You. Will You please accept them now into Thy Kingdom. And may they take up their membership in some lovely church of Yours and live as Christians throughout the rest of their life. Father, they didn't raise their hands to me, they raised it to You. The... And I'm sure that You receive them, for Thou hast said in Thy Word, "He that heareth My Words, and believeth on Him that sent Me, has everlasting life, and shall never come into judgment; but has passed from death into life." O God, I thank Thee, that in glory, right now, names are being written down in the Lamb's Book of Life. Keep them, O Father, into Thy grace. And I pray this week that You'll heal every sick person. And even right now, Lord, may there not be a feeble one among us. But may the kind Holy Spirit send a shower of blessing upon the people right now, and heal every one, and save every one. And may the revival begin right away, that people will be coming from all over Germany, sweetly, saying, "There is a fountain open for the sin and uncleanness, and for the healing of the body. O God, grant this; in Jesus Christ's Name. Amen.

L-39 The Lord bless you. At two-thirty tomorrow afternoon, we will speak once more on salvation and on the plan of Divine healing. Tomorrow night, there'll be a prayer line. We'll start the healing...?... How many thinks you understand it now, the plan of salvation and for healing? Would you raise your hand, say, "I believe I understand." Now, listen to this. If Jesus Christ, the Son of God, if He doesn't come into this audience and do the same thing that He did where He was here on earth, then I have been a false witness. That's a great statement, but I know Who I have believed. He has declared it in other nations, and He'll do it in this nation. Do you believe it? Are you expecting it? Are you praying for it? Then you shall see it. Amen. Shall we bow our heads again while the brother prays again. (God bless you. Now, you pray.) Courtesy of Living Word Broadcast P. O.
