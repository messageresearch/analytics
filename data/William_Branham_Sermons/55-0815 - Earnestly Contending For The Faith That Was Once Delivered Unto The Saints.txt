--- TRANSCRIPT ---

L-1 I went to my room. I went to praying for you, that God would let you all live a long life full of victory, and someday I could meet every one of you and shake your hand. I know He will. Then I was real tired. I had been very tired for several days. See, I just go from one meeting to another. I was with the Methodist people in America with a great meeting. And I just left there one day, come all night over here, started right in here. So there's about six hours difference in time. So I'm all turned around. My nights are days; my days are nights.

L-2 I--I took off my wet clothes awhile ago. And I thought I'd lie down just a moment. And I thought I'd wake up just in a little bit...?... went to sleep. And when Brother Guggenbuhl and those come after me, they woke me up. So I had to hurry to get here. So I am trusting to God that He will anoint me for the service tonight. And you pray for me too, that God will help me. Thank you. Now, I want to read some Scripture...?... In the Book of Jude and the 3rd verse, it reads like this. Beloved, when I gave all diligence to write unto you of the common salvation, it was needful for me to write unto you, and to exhort you that you should earnestly contend for the faith that was once delivered unto the saints.

L-3 Now, I want to quote that real close, "That you should earnestly contend for the faith that was once delivered unto the saints." Now, that book is written in mystery. No one understand it by mental understanding. You'll never understand it by education. You only can understand it as God will reveal it. God said in His Word, "I've hid it from the eyes of the wise and prudent. And I will reveal it unto babes, such as will learn." So no matter how we try to think it is. It's all written in mysteries by the Holy Spirit. And the Holy Spirit reveals it as you open your heart. So let us bow our heads and talk to Him, and let Him reveal it, while we speak to the Author of this Book. Shall we pray.

L-4 Our heavenly Father, here we are tonight way over in this lovely land of Germany among these humble, lovely people. They love You. They proved it this afternoon, when they stood to their feet and wanted You to come into their hearts. Now, Father, that they may know that You are real and You're the only true living God, and Jesus Christ is Your Son, will You reveal to us tonight, by Your great Spirit, the revelation of Your Bible. For we ask it Jesus' Name. Amen. Now, the subject: "Earnestly Contending For The Faith That Was Once Delivered Unto The Saints."

L-5 Now, I just want to speak a few moments, for there's many to be prayed for. And I want each one of you to have faith in God, for God has already provided a healing for you. Each one of you that is sick tonight is already healed in the eyes of God. For Jesus, when He died at the cross, He provided a Blood from His back for your healing. Then in the sight of God you are already healed. Every sinner, you are already saved; for God, at Calvary, by Jesus Christ, wounded Him for your transgressions hundreds of years ago. Now, the only thing that you have to do to become a Christian is to accept--to accept what God--what God has already provided for you, for salvation and also for healing.

L-6 Now, first place, the Word of God is the only plan and the only truth about God. The Word is God. You understand? The... "In the beginning..." I'm quoting Scripture. "In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God." So the Word is God." Now, then if God has said something, it's up to God to take care of His own Word. Now, if I didn't believe that, I certainly wouldn't want to be telling you all. I would rather go to heaven and stand in the Presence of God, to be judged an infidel, than to go to heaven and be judged a hypocrite. I would rather take my chance, as against Him, than to be a pretender. 55-0815, Earnestly Contending For The Faith That Was Once Delivered Unto The Saints, Unknown, Karlsruhe, Germany, 89 min

L-7 What good would it do me to come over here and tell you something that wasn't so? It's dangerous flying the ocean. It's hard for me to leave my children crying. I've got a little ten- weeks-old baby. And when mother was holding him up, and he tried to hold his little hand for me, looked like... My little girl holding onto my leg, saying, "Daddy, don't go," it's not easy. But there's little girls in Germany who's to be prayed for. I must go tell them and pray for them. Now, I didn't come for money. I didn't come for popularity. I didn't come to build new churches. Neither did I come to tear down the ones that is built. I come for one purpose: the love in my heart of Jesus Christ for you people. And I--I mean that.

L-8 Because if I would die an--an impersonator, a hypocrite, I would be lost. No matter what I done. I'd be lost. I want to go to heaven. I got a father up there. And I got loved ones up there. And Jesus is there. And I want to see them. So I come with all my heart, to try to tell you what the Lord Jesus has done for you. You accept it. Now, to our text: "Earnestly contending for the faith that was once delivered to the saints." Now, every one of us wants to believe that our church does that. The Methodists, they say they are contending for it. The Baptists, they say they contend for it. The Catholic, they say they contend for it. The Lutheran, they say they contend for it. The Pentecostal, they say they contend for it. The Nazarene, they say they contend for it. But they different so much one from another. Now, there's only... I believe that they do. And I love them all. I have nothing against any. But we want to find out, really, what is the faith. Well, if the Nazarenes different from the Pentecost. And the Pentecost different from the Methodists. The Lutheran different from the Catholic. How we going to know? There's only one way, what the Bible says. That must be the truth.

L-9 Now, it was to contend for "the" faith, "the," not "a." "The" one faith. There is only really one faith, one Lord, one God, one baptism, one faith. Now, so we have to go back to find out what this faith is. Now, I ask you, as my dear beloved brother and sister, that you will take this under consideration. Because, it must come from the Bible. Now, it may be a little different from what you've been taught. When Jesus came, the church was looking for Him to come. But He come so much different, until they failed to recognize Him. Could it be so again today that the same thing has happened? Let's see. Now, if it is the faith that was delivered to the saints, it'll have to come from the New Testament, because they were only called "saints" in the New Testament. So let's go back.

L-10 Now, how many in here has ever read the New Testament? Would you raise your hand? Wonderful. Now, you can--you can follow me and see if I misquote the Scriptures. It is so hard through an interpreter. I will just quote it. Now, in the beginning, the first one of the New Testament was John the Baptist. John stood between law and grace. He never come under the Christian dispensation, neither was he under the law. He was the forerunner of Jesus Christ, "A voice of one crying in the wilderness, 'Make a way, a path for the Lord!'" That is right, isn't it? Amen. Then, the first one to introduce the faith for the Christian church was none other than Jesus Himself. He was the introduction of the faith that was to be handed to the Christian church. Do you believe that?

L-11 Now, we'll have to see what He was. We'll have to see what kind of a church He organized, and see what kind of doctrine He preached, and what kind of a works He did, and what He left for the people to do. And then see if the disciples, if they done the same thing He did, and the way they did; then we'll know, by the Bible, what was the faith that was once delivered to the saints. Would that be true? Amen. Now, when Jesus came, we all know about His birth, born in a manger. And He went out the way of capital punishment. (Out of the world, through capital punishment, executed) through a stable door to a rugged cross. His life was completely misunderstood. The first time that the Angels introduced Him, and the wise men followed the star, when He was first born He was persecuted until the day He died by the church. That's true. We know... He was misunderstood, but He was God's Son.

L-12 Now, His work began after His baptism at the age of thirty. Immediately after God the Father came down in the form of the Holy Ghost, look--looked like a dove and went into Him, His works began, not before. And neither can it 55-0815, Earnestly Contending For The Faith That Was Once Delivered Unto The Saints, Unknown, Karlsruhe, Germany, 89 min begin in you, until Jesus comes in the form Holy Ghost to live in you. Now, watch. Immediately He started praying for the sick. And the people begin to get healed. The lawyers, the doctors, they come out and they criticized Him. But let's see what kind of a faith He introduced to them. We'll start in the book of Luke. We find out that in the book of Luke, why the first thing we find him a doing; standing, praying for the sick. He had a man by the name of Philip, got converted. He got saved, and he went to find his friend. That was a good sign he got saved. He wanted to tell somebody else.

L-13 Every man that finds Christ, it's so much to him, he wants to tell his friends and everybody. So he went around into another part of the country. And he finds a man who was his friend. His name was Nathanael. And he found Nathanael under a tree, praying. So he said, "Come, see Who I have found; Jesus of Nazareth, the Son of Joseph." And Nathanael was very much religious. And he said, "Could there any good thing come out of Nazareth?" And Nathanael or Philip, gave him the best answer I know. He said, "Come and see." That's so good. That's good yet. "Come and see. Look for yourself."

L-14 And Nathanael went with him. Then when he come to where Jesus was, I can imagine seeing him come up to where the prayer line was, where Jesus was praying for the sick. Jesus stopped, looked around, and He said, "Behold, an Israelite in whom is no guile." Why, it astonished him, that is, the--the Nathanael. He said, "How did He know me?" He said, "Rabbi, how do You know me? I've never seen you before. And You have never seen me. How did You know I was a righteous man?" You see, he could've been a sinner.

L-15 Now, the word, "Behold, an Israelite in whom there is no guile," if I'd say that to you in German tonight, I'd say, "A righteous man in whom is the truth. He's not a liar, a righteous man!" Why, he said, "How did You know I was?" Listen to Jesus. He said, "Before Philip called you, when you were under that tree, I saw you." Amen. What did Philip say... What did Nathanael say? He said, "Thou art the Son of God. Thou art the King of Israel." And He said, "Because I told you that, you believe Me? Then you shall see greater things." Now, what did the Pharisees say? They said, "He has a devil. He is Beelzebub. He is the prince of all the devils." In other words, He was a... They believed Him to be a spiritualist, a work of devils, mind reader, or a fortuneteller. "He was the king of all of them," that's what the Pharisees said. I wonder what they'll say in Germany if He would come tonight and do the same thing. What attitude would they take? I hope they take Nathanael's attitude, don't you? Amen.

L-16 That was what was Jesus introduced. One day he had to go down to Samaria. And that is down the valley from Jerusalem, but He had to go up around the way... I mean to Jericho, I meant. And He had to go up to Samaria. I wonder why. And He set down on the well. The well, if I had time I would explain to you what those wells are, just outside the city where all the people come and get their water. And he sent His disciples away to buy food. And he set down under the vine back against the well. It was near noon. And out came a woman, and she lets down her water pot to get some water. And Jesus said to her, "Bring Me a drink." And she turned and she said, "It's not customary for you Jews to have any fellowship with we Samaritans." See, there was a racial condition, like there is in the world today.

L-17 And Jesus said, "If you knew Who you were talking to, why, you'd ask Me for a drink. And I'd give you water that you don't come here to draw." Why, she said, "The well is deep. And You have nothing to draw with." What do you think Jesus was doing? I believe you'll be able to answer that after tonight. Jesus was contacting her spirit. And as soon as He found where her trouble was, He said, "Go, get your husband." That's what He said. Is that right? And she said, "I have no husband. What are you asking me about a husband? I don't even have a husband." He said, "That's right. You got five. And the one you have now is not your husband." She said, "Sir, I perceive that You're a prophet." 55-0815, Earnestly Contending For The Faith That Was Once Delivered Unto The Saints, Unknown, Karlsruhe, Germany, 89 min

L-18 Notice. She said, "We know, we Samaritans, we know that when Messiah cometh, He will tell us these things. But Who are You?" Do you see friends? Not Beelzebub. That was the very sign of the Messiah. Do you understand? The woman said, "When the Messiah cometh (which is Jesus), He will do these things. He will be able to know what we're thinking of. He will be able to tell us our sins, and tell us whether we're wrong or right by this supernatural power. But Who are You? Are You a prophet?" Jesus said, "I am He." Amen. "I am the Messiah. I am He that speaketh to thee." That was Jesus yesterday. That's Jesus today. That's Jesus tomorrow. That's Jesus forever. The Bible says, "Jesus Christ is the same yesterday, today, and forever." Is that right? Then if he's raised from the dead, He could do the same things He did yesterday, He will do today. He will do tomorrow and will forever. Amen.

L-19 Now, the woman run into the city and she said, "Come, see a Man that told me everything I ever did." Now, she was excited. She was thrilled because she had met Him. Now, He never told her everything she did. He just told her that one thing. But she knew if God could reveal that to Him. God could reveal everything to Him. Amen. That was Jesus yesterday. That's Jesus today. And one day He was coming out of Jericho, and a blind man was setting against the wall, many yards from where He passed by. Thousands of people were following Him. A lot of them a hollering to Him, "Hypocrite, Beelzebub, impostor; away with such a fellow." And others were saying, "Hosanna to the King." Some of them were blessing Him, and some were cursing Him. Oh, such a noise.

L-20 Jesus, knowing He was going to Calvary to die for the sins of the world, walked unmoved, following the Father, doing nothing but what God told Him, looking towards Calvary. In a few days He must die for the sins of the world. How would He have ever heard that blind man? But the blind man cried, "O Jesus, Thou Son of David, have mercy on me." And the faith of that blind beggar stopped Jesus in His tracks. He stopped, said, "Bring him here." See what faith will do?

L-21 One day, going through a crowd... A little woman had spent all of her money for the doctors, and none of them could do her no good. She had a blood issue. It was her age, perhaps menopause. And said she had spent all her money. The doctors couldn't help her. She had heard about Jesus. She said, "I'm not worthy to go to Him. But if I can ever touch His clothes, I believe God is in Him. If I can touch His clothes, I'll get well." Now, she had no Scripture about that. But her faith went beyond that. But you've got Scripture tonight to believe what I'm trying to tell you, thousands times more than that woman had. But she pressed through the crowd; she crawled up behind Him, touched His garment, and went back, and stood in the crowd. Everybody around Jesus... Jesus stopped. He said, "Who touched Me?" Everybody said, "Not me." The Bible said all denied. But He said, "Somebody touched Me." Peter said, "Well, everybody is touching You, Lord." "Yes, He said, but somebody has touched Me. I'm getting weak. Virtue's going out." And He looked around over the crowd. And everybody saying, "Not me."

L-22 But He found that little woman. Oh, He said, "Thy faith has saved thee." For she felt in her heart, with faith in Him, that if she could touch Him, she'd be healed. That was Jesus yesterday. That's Jesus today. That's Jesus forever. He never said, "I healed you." He said, "Your faith has healed you." If a little woman's faith pulled Jesus around in the crowd, and pick her out, and tell her that her faith had made her whole from that blood issue...?... the same Jesus tonight. Amen. Jesus didn't claim to be a big person. He didn't dress any different from other men. He didn't dress like a rabbi. He walked among men. He looked like an ordinary men. He walked with men. He dressed like men. And He lived among men, so much that they didn't even know Him. He did not dress like a priest. He dressed like an ordinary man. And He didn't say, "I'm a healer." But He said, "I can do nothing. It's not Me that doeth the work. It's the Father that dwelleth in Me. The Holy Spirit is in Me. He doeth the work." That was Jesus yesterday. That's Jesus today. That's 55-0815, Earnestly Contending For The Faith That Was Once Delivered Unto The Saints, Unknown, Karlsruhe, Germany, 89 min Jesus forever. Amen. Never be a boaster. "I belong to so-and-so." No.

L-23 "Not Me, the Father that dwelleth in Me, He doeth the work." And if Jesus, the Son of God, never taken credit (credit, never taken glory) for healing sick, how could you expect a man to take glory for it? Any true spirit will speak of God and say Jesus is the Son of God, Who died for the person. Now, look at Jesus again. I see Him. He goes through the pool of Bethesda. Many great multitudes of people, thousands laid there. Look what kind of people was laying there. The Bible says, "Lame, blind, halt, withered, waiting for the moving of the water." For an Angel come down every month or two, and ever who stepped in the water first, got healed, if they had faith of whatever disease they had. Do you believe God sent an Angel? If you do say, "Amen." [Congregation says, "Amen."--Ed.] An Angel came down.

L-24 Now, a lot of aristocrats said, "They're--they're crazy. That's no Angel." But God was healing anyhow. God has always had a place of healing, since He's been God and man's been man. That's right. There's always been a preparation for healing since Genesis. When He raised the brass serpent, they started worshipping that. He tore that down. Then He sent an Angel on a pool of water. And the--the history says it was terrible. For when the Angel went to moving on the water, the waters were troubled.

L-25 Now, you German people, here in this lovely land where there's lakes and things, rivers, the famous Rhine. You know what troubled waters is, you boatmen... When the... Troubled waters is when the current is going one way and the wind is moving in another way. Dangerous waters... So when this Angel came down and begin to trouble the water, the first one in that had faith, all the virtue of the Angel went onto the man, and he was healed. And he went out rejoicing. And the Angel went back for maybe a month or two, but they waited patiently. And when the water would get troubled, they would fight one another with knives to get in.

L-26 Jesus come walking through that crowd, full of virtue. The woman had just touched His garment and had been healed. Here he comes walking in through that crowd. He walked by the blind. He went by the lame. He went by the halt, never touched any of them. And He went over to a man, laying on a little quilt, that had some kind of a disease. He could walk. He wasn't going to die with it. He'd had it twenty-eight years. It was retarded. And He walked over to that man, and He said, "Will thou be made whole?" Never said nothing to the blind, lame, and halt. Went over to this man that wasn't helpless, maybe prostate trouble or TB, something. It wasn't going to bother him too much. He said, "Will thou be made whole?" Why, he said, "Sir, I have no one to put me in the water. While I'm coming, somebody beats me there." Jesus said, "Take up your bed and go into your home," and then walked away and left all the rest of them.

L-27 What do you think in Jerusalem they thought about that? Here He was, Son of God, full of virtue, making sick well, and walked by a scene like that and healed a man that was almost well anyhow, and walked away and left the rest of them laying there. "And they say He was full of compassion?" Oh, my. That stirred up the church. They found the man packing his bed on the Sabbath. Then they called Jesus to question. If He would come to this city tonight, that same attitude would be taken in any city in the world tonight. They would say this, "If He is a healer, let me see Him heal this one." See? The devil takes his man, but the devil returns in another man. See, the critics, they don't understand. They say, "Heal this one, and we'll believe you." That's the same spirit, said, "Come off the cross. Come down from the cross and I'll believe you."

L-28 Now, notice after Jesus was called in question... Now, listen close and read it. Here is the keynote. Jesus said. I've been quoting from Saint John 5, and now the 19th verse. Jesus answered the question, Saint John 5:19. Listen to what Jesus said. "Verily, verily..." that means "absolutely, absolutely," I say unto you, the Son can do nothing in Himself. But what He sees the Father doing, that doeth the Son likewise." Amen. Do you see, it isn't in man. It wasn't in the Son of man. It's in God. No flesh glories in His Presence. Jesus said, "I can't do nothing until the Father shows Me a vision; and when I see a vision, then I do it." How many understand, say, "Amen." [Congregation says, "Amen."--Ed.] Now, let me say it again. Jesus said, "I can do nothing in Myself." 55-0815, Earnestly Contending For The Faith That Was Once Delivered Unto The Saints, Unknown, Karlsruhe, Germany, 89 min Now, let's suppose if they're just making somebody comfortable. Listen to this. This is life. This might mean your healing.

L-29 "Verily, verily, I say unto you, the Son can do nothing in Hisself. I only do what the Father shows Me to do. I see a vision, and then I go do what He shows Me." How many understands that? Hold up your hand. Thank you. That was Jesus yesterday. That's Jesus today. That's Jesus forever. He can only do as God will show. He saw visions. Look at Him. Nowhere in the Bible did Jesus ever perform a miracle or do anything unless first God showed Him by a vision. That's His own Word. Amen. "I only do what the father shows Me." Saint John 5:19. Now, He said, "These things that I do shall you also." How many's read that in the Bible? Say "Amen." [Congregation says, "Amen."--Ed.]

L-30 "These things that I do shall you also, and more than this shall you do, for I go to the Father. Yet a little while, and the unbeliever, the world will see Me no more. But ye shall see Me. (Who? The believers, the church.) Ye shall see Me. For I will be with you. I'll be in you to the end of the world," Jesus Christ the same yesterday, today, and forever. If He has risen from the dead, He is not a dead Christ. Sometimes churches act like He's dead. But praise God, He is not dead. He is a living forevermore. And He's here. And He will live His same Life, and do the same things that He promised. If He doesn't, He isn't God, and His Word's not right. For He said, "Ye shall see Me, for I'll be with you to the end of the world." Amen. He will be in us. Now, let's see if the apostles taken that doctrine.

L-31 Just a moment. I think Nicodemus really expressed the thought to the--of the Pharisees when he slipped around through the dark to come to find Jesus. And he said, "Rabbi, we know that You're a teacher." Now, listen, "We." Who? The church, the Pharisees, they couldn't accept Him or they'd be excommunicated. "But we know that You're a teacher come from God. For no man can do the things that You do without God being with Him." Is that right? Philip expressed it... I mean, Peter expressed it at Pentecost in Acts 2. Why, he said, "Ye men of Israel, Jesus of Nazareth, a man approved of God among you..." Not by his education, not by his great theology... How? "By signs and wonders which God did with Him, among you all, which you all witnesses." Is that right? That's what he said.

L-32 Now, that's the faith that was delivered to the saints. We're supposed to contend for that. What happened? The apostles had it. Look at Peter on the housetop. He saw a vision that told him to go over to the Gentiles and preach the Gospel. The house of Cornelius... Look way down when Paul, great Pharisee was struck off of his horse and was blinded. And he went down and laid in the street called Straight in the city of Damascus. Way down in Damascus, a pastor of a little mission hid back, because the church was going to get after them... Paul came down, the great Pharisee with a letter to arrest them people, practicing Divine healing, speaking about the resurrection of the dead. "Away with such a people." And God struck him blind, and he fell on his face.

L-33 And down in this little mission, a uneducated person, a little fellow named Ananias, he saw a vision. And he came, walking through the town, down by the main pump, the cistern, or the well. And he saw the vision where he was supposed to go. And he went in. He said, "Paul, on your road down, you were struck down. The Lord Jesus appeared to you." Why, sure, that was right. How did he know it? He was contending for the faith that was once delivered to the saints. He laid his hands upon him. God opened his eyes. It was a vision. Paul never said, "Come, lay your hands on me." God told Ananias, "Go lay your hands on Paul." See, it's God by vision. Paul, out in the sea fourteen days and nights, no sun or moon, all hopes was gone they'd ever be saved. Two hundred and eighty men on ship, the ship was waterlogged about to sink. All was crying. They wasn't eating.

L-34 Paul went down in the bulkhead and begin to pray one night. Here he comes running up the steps, said, "Brethren, be of a good cheer. For the Angel of God Whose servant I am, stood by me last night. He said, 'Don't fear, Paul.' Got to come before Caesar. And lo, God's give all that sail with you to you." But he said, "I saw in the vision that the ship's going to be wrecked on a certain island." He said, "Wherefore, brethren, be of a good cheer. For I believe God, and it 55-0815, Earnestly Contending For The Faith That Was Once Delivered Unto The Saints, Unknown, Karlsruhe, Germany, 89 min shall be just as he showed me," Jesus Christ the same yesterday, today, and forever. Do you believe it? He has raised from the dead. He's here tonight. Now, what does He do? He works through individuals as He has called. "God has set (not the church has set), but God has set in the church: first, apostles; second, prophets; teachers; evangelists." All kinds of gifts God has placed in the church for the perfecting, or drawing together.

L-35 I want to ask you something. The early church operated under every one of the gifts. Do you believe that? Now, look. This is to you Pentecostal people. You believe in speaking in tongues. That's right. It's the Bible. I shall not take it out. God put it in there, and it's God's Word. Paul said, "If one--if you all speak with tongues, and one comes in, uneducated, he will say you're all mad. The unbeliever doesn't understand. But he says if one is a prophet, and will reveal the thing, then they'll fall down and say, 'God is with you.'"

L-36 Paul was setting in the church, thirty-three years after the death of Jesus, for the church to continually to contend for the faith that was once delivered to the saints. At the end of the Bible, they begin to get other teachers, said, "Well, that's not so. Maybe it could be wrong." They had never been with Jesus. So Jude raised up. He said, "I want you to earnestly contend for the faith that was once delivered to the saints."

L-37 Now, before I call the prayer line, I want to say this to you. Do you believe that Jesus raised from the dead literally physically bodied? Do you believe it? [Congregation says, "Amen."--Ed.] Thank you. I believe that He is alive tonight. I believe this is God's infallible Word. And God will keep His Word. Do you believe that? [Congregation says, "Amen"--Ed.] Then if Jesus has raised from the dead, and will come here tonight, and do the same things that He did here on earth, do what the Father shows Him, will you believe Him, love Him, and worship Him, and live true to Him? If you will, raise your hand. Thank you.

L-38 That's a great statement. But, friend, as a man, a Christian, I believe Him. His Word is not stumbling to me. What He said is the truth. I believe it. And I'll believe that each one of you in your churches... I have nothing against your churches. I never come here to make differences in your churches. I come with God's love that you go to your church and be a better Christian. And get other sinners to believe and come to church, any church that believes God. See what I mean? Now, that's a great statement. Now, let us pray. Our Father, Who art in heaven, we pray in the Name of the Lord Jesus that You will come to us tonight. Father, it is today in Germany like it was in Palestine after Your resurrection. There was two disciples. They were walking along the road on a Easter morning, sad. They thought You were dead. They were on their road to Emmaus. And out from one side of the road stepped the resurrected Jesus. They didn't know Him. Father, I'm sure that You've got children here tonight, that You've walked with, and You've helped, and they didn't recognize it was You.

L-39 When the disciples got to the end, they asked You to come in. Once when You got inside, the doors closed behind You... God, do that to everyone tonight. Come into every heart. Close the unbelief behind. Then when You set down at the table, You done something different from other men. You did something like other men don't do. They knew it was You. They were happy. They returned, rejoicing. Oh, Jesus, for Your Gospel's sake, do something a little different tonight. Do it the way You done when You were here on earth, that this people would know that we're not false witnesses of the resurrection, for Thou art here. And we will return to our homes rejoicing, for we know then that Jesus has risen from the dead, and Christianity is the only true religion. And Jesus is the Author, and God is His Father. Grant it, Lord.

L-40 And may Your unworthy servant from--be able to submit myself to You, that You could take this poor wretched body and declare Your Name among the people. Here I am, Father. I submit myself unto Thee. Let the great Holy Ghost come and declare the resurrection, in Jesus' Name. Amen. Now, we cannot stand too many people at a time. Now, just a little bit ago before the service started, Doctor Guggenbuhl and the boys passed out some prayer cards. Who has prayer cards? Raise up your hand. All right. Now, look on your card. And see what number there is. (What is it? Prayer cards A. How many now? Fifty.) Doctor Guggenbuhl said they gave out prayer card A-1 to 50. Who has prayer card number 1? Raise up your hand if you can. 55-0815, Earnestly Contending For The Faith That Was Once Delivered Unto The Saints, Unknown, Karlsruhe, Germany, 89 min The man, would you come here? Who has number 2? Raise up your hand. Over here. Number 3? Hold up hand. Lady over here. Number 4? Hold up your hand. Number 4? Number 5? Hold up your hand. Over here.

L-41 Now, just we'll wait a minute. We don't want you to be disturbed. Everybody be sure to keep reverent. Be real reverent. Now, it's not a game. Our heavenly Father, these people is Your children. And they have laying here great box of handkerchiefs. They're going out here in Germany and many other places to the poor, sick, and needy. Look out there, Father. That poor old blind daddy, the handkerchief here represents, setting there in that little room tonight waiting for the handkerchief. Look at that sick mother in the hospital. Look at that little baby, very near death. O God, be merciful.

L-42 And we're taught in the Bible that You promised the children of Israel a land of blessing. And on the road over to get them, the Red Sea got in their way. God was moving in a Pillar of Fire. And You looked down on the Red Sea, through the Pillar of Fire with angered eyes. For it was cutting off the people from the blessings that He had promised. And the sea got scared and moved back. And Israel went on to the promised land. O God, You promised us health. And I pray that when I send these handkerchiefs, and they're laid upon the sick bodies, may God look back to the Blood of Jesus from Calvary, and may the demons of sickness get scared and move away, and may they get good health and strength. O God, I bless these handkerchiefs of this purpose, in the Name of Jesus Christ, God's Son. Amen.

L-43 The Lord bless. Now, we'll get to the rest of the prayer cards just in a few... We just can't have too many standing. How many here that does not have prayer card, you will not be called to the prayer line, and you're sick, and you want Jesus to heal you? Would you raise your hand? Thank you. I ask you one thing. You believe with all your heart that Jesus Christ raised from the dead, and God is here. He's the same Jesus that you can touch the hem of His garment. He will heal you right out there. Just believe. Now, Brother Arganbright, would you stand here? The reason that I get those around me who I know. I know they're diseases. I know what's wrong with them. And when the anointing of the Holy Ghost comes, every spirit becomes subject, and I can know who they are.

L-44 Now, I do not know none of you. I can't even speak your language. I never seen you in my life. But God knows you all. He knows what's wrong with you. He knows what you've done in life. And if He will come and do the same thing that He did when He was in Jesus, you believe Him? The Lord bless you. Now, in the Name of Jesus Christ, everyone be quiet. Be reverent. No matter what goes on up here. Don't get panicky. Stay quiet. Stay reverent. The sicknesses are demons. I'll prove that this week by the Bible. They don't like to leave. The only one can make them, is your faith in Jesus Christ. Now, be reverent.

L-45 And now, you bring your prayer line. Now, I want you to be real reverent. It's very hard. It comes from God. And it has to be Divine. Here stands a man. I never saw him in my life. We were born many thousands of miles apart. This is our first time meeting. Now, I'm going to ask my interpreter to be alert (be ready.) Audience, be ready. Just look this way and believe the Lord Jesus Christ, the Son of God. Now, I say to you all, God be with you. Now, this man standing here is just like the woman at the well. I don't know him. The only thing I could do would be talk to him a minute. And if God could reveal to me what's his trouble, just like He did through Jesus to the woman at the well... If Jesus will do that, will you believe Him? Will you accept Him as your Healer? Now, what's to this man? Stand up...

L-46 Look this way. I am a stranger to you, sir. I have never seen you. But God knows you and He knows me. If we are strangers and know not each other, raise up your hand. If we are strangers, if you do not know me, raise up your hand...?... What was it? [Interpreter says, "He doesn't know you."--Ed.] (Yes, well, tell him to raise his hand so the...?... So the people will know I had no contact with you.) Of course I can see, and so they can they, that you have a bad eye. Anyone can see that. But Jesus knows other things. And if Jesus will reveal something about him, then you've all promised to believe the Lord Jesus. Now, let us look to 55-0815, Earnestly Contending For The Faith That Was Once Delivered Unto The Saints, Unknown, Karlsruhe, Germany, 89 min God.

L-47 The man is in a dying condition. He is suffering. He has been to doctor. And the doctor examined the stomach. And it is a cancer. And the cancer is on the duodenal of the stomach, where the food empties out. Either, faith, or the man dies. That is true. You believe Jesus here? [Congregation says, "Amen."--Ed.] You believe? I want to ask you something. There is something moving on you now, a feeling that you know that you're in the presence of Something, not your brother. You know that you're in the Presence of Jesus. For He's standing here. He knows you. Come, let me pray. Shall we bow our heads. Dear heavenly Father, have mercy upon this man and heal him. Let him live, Lord. This demon called cancer has come upon him. And I now ask that it goes away. In the Name of Jesus Christ, I curse this cancer, and may it go from him. Amen. Go, be of good courage. Testify at the end of the week.

L-48 Here is lady. I never seen her. But God knows her. And God can make her well or give her whatever she's here for. I never seen the woman. I know nothing of her. God knows her and can heal her. The lady setting there with arthritis, you believe Jesus make you well? If you'll stand up, the lady with the brown dress on. Yeah. Lady, raise to your feet. Your faith has made you whole. Let's say, "Praise the Lord."

L-49 Now, look this way quickly right away. Watch. Lady, I don't know you. But God knows you. Do you believe Jesus Christ to be the Son of God? If God will tell me what you're here for, that you believe that He will heal you? With all your heart? Now, I can't heal you. God can heal you. But I don't know you. But God does. And if He will explain and let me know what you're coming to Him for, you believe Him? The lady has a dark spirit with her. That trouble is in her side, the right side. It's a lump. It's a cancer, and it's in your right side. That's right. Raise your hand. Raise your hand if that's true. And here's more than that. all your life you've had a feeling that you wanted to serve Jesus. You have never accepted Him yet. But you want Him for your Saviour. That is true. Will you now accept Jesus as your Saviour? If you will, wave your hand to Him. Hallelujah.

L-50 Almighty God, in the Name of Jesus Christ I condemn this demon, that he goes from my sister. And may he go and never bother her no more. This I ask in Jesus' Name. Amen. You are a Christian now. And God be with you. Now, go; the lump will leave. Amen. If God knows what you have had, what you have been, you know whether that's true or not. What I said is the truth. Is that right? Then he knows what will be. Go and don't doubt. You'll get well. You feel happy now. You are a Christian. God bless you. Let us say, "Amen." [Congregation says, "Amen."--Ed.] Give praise to God. Don't doubt. Have faith.

L-51 Oh, what a time. Believe now, and you shall have what you've asked for. I am watching the Light. It's still over the lady. Do you wish to get over that skin disease, lady, that you have? You believe that Jesus make you well, setting here on the front row? You believe, lady setting right here? While you were setting there, while you were looking this way, you said, "I wish I was up there. I would be healed." That is true. If that's true, raise your hand. Amen. I am not reading your mind. I had my back turned to you. But your faith touched Jesus and now you're healed. Your faith has made you whole. You don't need prayer card. You need faith in Jesus. Amen. He is risen from the dead. He does as He sees. Have faith. Don't doubt.

L-52 The lady is stranger to me. I do not know her. You have faith, and you believe with all heart. I see a--a hospital, a place where the men dressed with white. And they are ministering to you. You come from hospital. And you have been nervous, real scared, upset. And something has been talking to you, telling you that you were going to lose your mind...?... That is true. Right. Do you believe Jesus Christ? Then go home and get well. In the Name of Lord Jesus Christ, cursed be this disease. Oh Satan, you're exposed. Come out of the woman, in the Name of Jesus Christ. Amen. Go rejoicing. Amen. God bless you. All right.

L-53 Will they bring the next patient? Lady, I do not know you. The parents of the children?

I do not know you. I've never seen you. The woman is a Christian. The man is trying--is trying to accept Christ as his Saviour, wanting to be a Christian. That is true. Her spirit feels welcomed. He is coming to the Light. You don't come from here. You come from another city. Long road, from below, coming up. You're from a city, a beautiful city. And it sets where lots of water is. It looks like Switzerland. You bring your child. The child has epilepsy spells that shake. If that is true, raise up your hand. Amen. Do you believe Jesus Christ will bless your child and these spells will leave it? Then you'll serve God all your life. Almighty God, I bless this child in the Name of Jesus Christ and may the evil spirit leave and may the baby get well, in Jesus' Name. Amen. Now, let us hear what happens to the baby. Watch it start getting better, then you come tell us about it. Amen.

L-54 All right, bring the next. How do you do? We are strangers to each other. I do not know you. God knows you. Be reverent. That lady, setting right there with a lady's trouble, right over from that post, the Light is hanging over you, lady. It's a lady's trouble, yes, raise up to your feet and accept your healing. Do you believe? That's it. Your faith has made you whole. God healed you, lady. Let us say, "Amen." Praise the Lord. His great mighty Being is here now. All devils is defeated through the Blood of Jesus Christ. God is still God. Amen.

L-55 That man setting out yonder, back beyond the post, that has to get up at night so many times, do you believe Jesus Christ healed you? You're well. Christ healed you.

It makes you all upset. And it makes you constipated, and you can't eat right. That is true. I curse that devil, in the Name of Jesus Christ. Go home; it won't bother you no more. It has left you. Amen. God bless you.

L-56 Let's just say, "Praise the Lord." You believe? Don't be disturbed. Demons will scream and everything. But we're in the Presence of Christ. No wonder evil spirits cry out; they know their time has come. I'm stranger. Do you believe me to be His prophet? With all your heart? Would you like to go home and eat your supper and be well?

Do you believe Jesus to be the Son of God? Do you believe I to be His prophet? Do you believe that's Jesus revealing to me? Then Jesus said this, "These signs shall follow them that believe. If they lay their hands on the sick, they shall recover." Then in the Name of Jesus Christ, I cast away this demon of power, and set my sister free to be well, in Jesus' Name. Amen. God bless you.

L-58 Let's say, "Praise be to God." Amen. Do you want to get over that foot trouble you're having? You believe Jesus will heal you of your foot trouble? If you believe, you can have it. Can you accept it? If you can, give Him praise. Amen. 55-0815, Earnestly Contending For The Faith That Was Once Delivered Unto The Saints, Unknown, Karlsruhe, Germany, 89 min What if I told you that the Lord healed you while you were setting in the seat, would you believe me? Then, go home. Your faith has healed you, in Jesus' Name.

It come from the audience. When this woman was healed, that demon spirit screaming to one another for help. It's the spiritual world. We're not talking about the outside. It's this lady laying in this chair with a red dress on. Have you a prayer card? No? Do you believe me to be His prophet? You were laying there looking to me, believing, saying, "Wonder if I could be well?" If God will reveal to me what your trouble is, will you accept Jesus as your Healer? Will you do it?
