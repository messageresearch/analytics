--- TRANSCRIPT ---

L-1 Thank you, Brother Lindsay. Good evening, friends. Brother Lindsay was just telling me, he had to slip out just a little bit early, and so we were just kinda talking it over...?... how it is. That's what was the... we were speaking of. I'm very happy to be here again tonight, and want to thank all of you for your time, and--and your fine things that you've done for us since we've been here. And today I had the privilege of setting with your pastors and their wives. Such a lovely hour of fellowship we had. The Presence of the Lord was there. I shall long remember it, of the fine cooperation among all of the ministers together, how lovely they all were, and how nice they--they--they were to me. And how nice all of you have been to me. There's so many things that you've done, I just can't mention them from the platform here. But I'm sure that every one of you knows what it is. And I'm very thankful from the depths of my heart for what you've done.

L-2 Even one brother was so kind awhile ago. He had a rifle he wanted to show me. He run out there and had it in the car, and said, "Just take your hand and put it on this...?... "But that's very nice. God bless him, and there's another...?... One brother came and taken me up in a big tower, up here today, two of them, up here where you look all over the city. And just little kind things... Last night when I went home, there was two cakes setting there and a great big cherry pie. And am I full of cherry pie...?... It was so good. I sure appreciate it. And I... Everybody's kind. I tell you about Cleveland people, I found this: they do more acting than they do talking. So that's--that's best. Action always speaks louder than words, definitely. That's right. A young man said to his--to his girlfriend. He kept telling her how much he loved her, and he--and he wasn't just exactly true as he should be. She said, "Why, honey, if you just act instead of talk..." So then... That's right. If you just act, instead of talk...

L-3 Well, we're sure the Lord will be with us tonight to bless us, give us of His--His blessings, I trust. Now, I...?... He turned it off of them. Or either I turned it off, one. Somebody turned it off anyhow. Can we... Don't believe... Now, we're getting somewhere. That's just li--like that light: it isn't the--the lamp that makes the light, it's the--the electricity that's in the wire that makes the light. It heats the wire, and the wire gets hot and makes the light. But it isn't the great wire. It takes the--the current off of it, it's dead. And that's the way it is with us. And did you ever know, electricity... I've worked in it for years. But there's--there's no one in the world that knows what electricity is. Isn't that strange? No one knows what it is. They can harness it; they can make it light; they can cook with it; they can heat with it; they can light with it. But no one knows what it is. It's two pieces of material rolling together makes the continuity, and sends out the electricity. And that's the way it is. When those two pieces get to rolling together, that's what brings it off in the generator. And so that's the way, when a--a Christian gets to working with God, rolling together, that brings an unseen force that does mysteries that none of us knows nothing about. Only we know It's God. Isn't that right? Yes. Take that away from us and we're dead, aren't we?

L-4 So we're thankful tonight that God has blessed us, given us of His grace. And now, may He add His blessings to us as we worship together tonight. And I was getting awfully tired. Last evening they got me. Before I even knowed where I was at, I was outside. And I... There aren't... Many of the ministers was praying for the sick, which I hear they claim that a great results. I'm so happy for that. And always remember: when you get sick, call your pastor, or go to your church: go somewhere and let someone pray with you. 50-0823, Testimony, Tent Meeting, Cleveland, OH, 78 min And little prayer cloths is commemoration of Divine healing. Many of you believe in that, don't you? sending a handkerchief one to another?

L-5 Now, I believe I made announcement before, and I will again tonight. I send those out by the thousands a week all over the world. And great testimonies of all kinds come in from everywhere. Some of the most outstanding testimonies, especially among the cripples and so forth, where they have to wait. And people who have children, they get them and keep them in the Bible. And every once in a while, you just hear of all kinds of things that's done. And now, I send those to anybody, anyplace in the world absolutely free. And if you wish one, just write me at Jeffersonville, Indiana, and I--I'll be glad to send it right to you. And I have some instructions now, that one of the secretaries at Jeffersonville, at the office sent me some last night, of the receipts, of how to believe healing in the Bible. I believe my brethren gave--sent out last night what I had here. There was a few left. He sent me about a dozen. I told him to give out to the sick people that's... And how to believe God on Bible grounds. And everything must be based on the Bible.

L-6 Now, if you wish one of these just to be in your home, just send after it, you're welcome. And just to... Put it on the... Acts the 19th chapter and leave it there. And when sickness or something in the home, why... I probably wasn't right for your picture. They told me you was going to take the picture, my brother. And he said it wasn't the reporters. So I--I'll be glad if you wish for another one. That's all right, brother. And so many times when Christians, or anything that can be done for--anything for the glory of God, all right. See? But I do not like the work of God criticized. That's right. All right, brother...?... And so I--I like for it... everything in God's Kingdom to run just as smoothly as...?... run.

L-7 Now, just write me, William Branham, Jeffersonville, Indiana, and I'll be glad to send you one. That's... Or what you need for some of your loved ones, to send them out. Now, when you find it, to have a little piece of paper that's been fixed up by, a little mimeographed sheet on what to do. But now the ribbon, I prayed over it myself, each one. Thousands upon thousands... Each time I go home, I just get great bolts, hundreds of yards of ribbon, take off to myself in the woods or somewhere, and set there and pray, and pray, and cut the ribbon, pray and pray for them. And I believe one thing that God will respect, is sincerity. If you be real sincere. That's what the Angel told me in praying said, "If you'll be sincere and will get the people to believe you, nothing shall stand before your prayer."

L-8 Something happened awhile ago, and I... It was an attempt of something, that I have never, in all the days of my ministry, ever did this. I... They asked me last evening of some business man of the city, which is a brother in Christ. And for the benefit of the Cleveland people, and all the people everywhere, for another day of service... The man has purchased the arena, or a big auditorium, somewhere here in the city, for a service. And he... They asked me last night, Brother Bowman, one of the associating pastors, that they would, or cooperating pastors, rather, if they would--if we'd have the service. And I told him I should pray and seek the Lord. The managers, I asked them, and they were all right. 'Course, whatever the Lord says to me. I was pretty tired, and yet I had to go. But what could anyone say to a group of people like this...?... coming. That's all. So Sunday afternoon, and Sunday night. They'll announce it, probably tomorrow. There'll be services in some auditorium here in the city or arena. And Sunday afternoon services will probably be a Gospel service, preaching, and Sunday night praying for the sick.

L-9 And I think we all ought to say for that brother who is sponsoring this, we ought to all say, "Thank God for our brother." [Congregation repeats--Ed.] "Thank God for our brother." Long may he and his live through ceaseless ages. For anyone that's got that much feeling for the sick people and the needs of the people of the city, God is sure to bless the business man like that. That's right. So it's greatly appreciated, I'm sure, by me and by the--all the people of this--of all the Christian people. Let's all gather out. Bring out the unsaved for Sunday afternoon. Maybe the Lord will give us a great altar call, and maybe a altar call, maybe make three, four, five hundred people [Blank.spot.on.tape--Ed.] will believe God. And as I go home praying tomorrow night with all my heart... [Blank.spot.on.tape--Ed.] get saved for Sunday afternoon that it 50-0823, Testimony, Tent Meeting, Cleveland, OH, 78 min may bring in precious souls into His Kingdom. Then Sunday night, oh, my, I just trust that we'll have a glorious healing service Sunday night. I trust it'll be so. May God bless all of you, and ever keep you in His Divine will is my prayer.

L-10 Now, for our Scripture reading, in... Just a testimony, and then we shall start the... Tonight, we're going to take just a regular... Go right ahead with the prayer service as usual, the Lord providing. One of the brothers was just a little elated this morning. Have I got time to tell this? I don't... It was a... We were having breakfast together, such a fellowship. I raised up to talk... And it's just about like it is in here now, just about that close. We were talking concerning the meetings, going out to the streets. Reverend Mister Bowman had a hold of my arm. Been talking, "How did you see those things, just what nature is it when it takes place?"

L-11 Well, while I was walking with him, all of a sudden, Something just came right down over me, and I realized I was in a different part of the city. I--I knew. I could hear Mister Bowman talking, but I--I knew I wasn't with him, I was somewhere else. And I looked, standing on the corner, there was a lady holding two little twins, or a little pair of twins. And they were, had their little hair braided in the back. She was holding them with her hands. Then I begin to get to myself, and I was still walking right with the ministers. Two or three of the ministers was walking along, and one of the minister's wives. And then we started for a little few steps farther. And just as I started to tell him about it, It came down on me again.

L-12 I was, that time, walking right along the street, but I was riding in a car, just as natural as if I was in my room and transformed right here. See? And I seen three girls with some kind of a--a costumes on, like they were--been to a wedding or something, walking the streets this way. I didn't know just what it was, they were crossing this a way. And he said... Then, I came to myself. And I told the brethren what was going to happen. And when we got in the car and started out, we was supposed to go south on a one way street. And this minister, I suppose to have been raised here, he turned right vice versa, went right down on the opposite side of the street.

L-13 And my, there was a big policeman mounted on a horse there, act like he was going to tear us apart. He was... Oh, my, he was just saying everything. And I wondered. And he held us up a few moments there. Just long enough for the three girls with the costumes to come walking by us. Said--said, "There's the reason, brother. Don't you see them there?" Oh, my. All of them said, "Praise the Lord," then. The cop said, "Go on," without--without giving us a ticket. See, it's just so happens, brothers. The infallibility of it, it's perfect. There's nothing bogus. It's real.

L-14 Now, there's many times those things happen. Many times, go into a city... Many times in a meeting. I stand here and see one after the other. That's in the meeting. I just don't take time. I took more time talking on something else. No doubt but what they're healed. The blessing applies to them. Now, I see in the meeting sometimes of different people that's going to be healed, see different desires and things of people. Now, I tell you... Now, in the prayer line tonight, just as certain as anything, God's going to make a great blessing come on. Now, if I--I don't find it here, it'll be in the prayer line, because I know it's for tonight. And I... See?

L-15 And notice. You see it, just--just walking along the street. Many times that's happened. You don't know when it's going to happen, or what's going to do. You're just simply transformed. And you, of course, you just taken off somewhere else, and showed just what's going to happen. Then you just drop right back down again. And then you know just what... Sometimes I be setting in the room. I'll be setting in the room at home, just setting there waiting. And it just seems like Something just changed, and you're somewhere else, and you see just what's going to happen, see the way it acts out. And then when it does, you be back in your room. And then when that comes to pass, you see it. It's nothing I do. I just act it out as drama. See? I just act out what He's already told me to do. That doesn't take faith. That's just acting out what He told me to do. See?

L-16 Now, the only part that faith is included in, is in this prayer line when I have to exercise faith here. But when it... 50-0823, Testimony, Tent Meeting, Cleveland, OH, 78 min When I'm praying for the sick... But someone, if you tell me to go to someone's house, and how everything would be. I just go there and wait until everything's just the way He says, then I just say what He said. And that's all. It's got to happen. It's already happened. It's in the foreknowledge of God. It's already been planned out. And I just go down and act that out. See? So it--it isn't nothing that I could do, but just act on what He told me to do.

L-17 Now, the ministers there, going along the street. My, it happens all the time. But just... I guess God just had me speak so that He'd let the ministers know it, know that I was talking about it up on the street there. And to let them see that happen. And even he turned... See, it wasn't him that turned that corner, the Holy Spirit had to take him down there. It had to be that way. Do you believe in that? It had to be. Those girls wouldn't have been anywhere else. We'd have went the other way, we'd have went around it. And see, the girls would done been up this other end two, three city blocks away. But we had to be there. He couldn't just went right ahead.

L-18 That police had to stop him and hold him there till those girls crossed in front of us according to what He showed me. See? And the police was just a bawling him out until that time. Then the police said, "Go ahead." See? The police didn't even know it was the Holy Spirit working on him. See? It was, holding him there. For, brother, sister, God makes the enemy crazy. Why, Judas Iscariot throwed down the silver and said, "I've betrayed innocent blood." See? Is that right? The Roman said, "Truly, that's the Son of God." Pilate's wife... Look at Pilate, said, "I wash my hands. I find no fault in Him." Is that true? That's His enemy. Look at his pagan wife. Said, "Have nothing to do with this just Man, for I've suffered many things in a dream today, because of Him." Is that right? A heathen... God makes His enemies to testify. The demons that were in those people screamed out and said, "Why, You're the Son of God, the Holy One of Israel." Is that right?

L-19 Demons, fortunetellers spoke out to the apostles. When others said they were impostors, these fortunetellers said, "Why, they're men of God that tell us the way of Life." See? Makes the demons testify of Him. Everything has to testify. On the day that He died, God testified. The earth testified. The moon and stars refused to shine. The sun went down in the middle of the day. The elements all changed. It was so dark you could feel it. And think, the moon shut off; the stars shut off; the very God that created them was returning back. God Himself, Jehovah, couldn't stand to see the sight of the punishment that had to be upon His own Son. And all the elements... When He--when He died, the Roman said, "That's the Son of God." There was a great earthquake that shook the rocks that had been in the mountains since the days of the creation. The earth claimed He was the Son of God. The sun said He was the Son of God. The moon, the stars, the elements, everywhere...

L-20 And He went to hell, and they knowed He was the Son of God. And those that repented not in the long-suffering of the days of Noah, had been waiting in those chains back in there, they knew He was the son of God. Their whole... Noah testified of Him. Enoch testified of Him before Noah. And all, everything had to know He was the Son of God, and that what had been spoke of the woman's seed had come to pass. Then He rose up, took the keys from the devil, the keys of death and hell, rose up, broke the sunders of the grave and split it open; come out. Oh, my, said, "All powers in heavens and earth is given into My hand. He that believeth in Me, though he were dead, yet shall he live. And whosoever liveth and believeth in Me shall never die." He ascended up on high, setting at the right-hand of God making intercessions. And we have just as much power as heaven's worth. Is that right?

L-21 What if someone would come in here tonight and give you a money order for a million dollars. Oh, my, a poor maybe in...?... Now, you would rejoice and say, "Oh, my," how rejoicing. And maybe there'd be a man come in that was tattered and poor, dirty, and ugly. And no matter what he looked like, it isn't the messenger, it's the message that he gives you. Is that right? So don't notice the messenger; it's the message that you're hearing. 50-0823, Testimony, Tent Meeting, Cleveland, OH, 78 min Now, and you'd look at that piece of paper, you'd start rejoicing. You'd say, "My, I'm worth a million dollars. It's a postal order for a million dollars, or a bank draft: a million dollars." You'd say... "I can't see; what are you rejoicing about? You haven't got nothing." You'd say, "Well, I've got a money order, or--for a million dollars." Well, I'd say, "Well, that isn't nothing but just a piece of paper, just ink wrote on a piece of paper." You'd say, "But looky here. That money order, before it could be written, there had to be a million dollars deposited before that order could be written." Is that right?

L-22 Well, you say, "When you read the Bible, what makes you all carry on so when you say, 'He was wounded for our transgressions, with His stripes you're healed?' When He said, 'Whatsoever things you desire, when you pray, believe that you've receive it and you shall have it.'" Well, we should start rejoicing. "Why," you say. "well, that's just a Words, just Words." But brother, before that Word could be written in the Bible, there had to be a deposit made at Calvary up there to take care of everything that He said. Yes, sir. And each one of us has an account there and can draw off of it tonight, just anything you have need of. And He's standing there with a pen in His hand at the right-hand of the Father, ready to write out your forgiveness, ready to write out your healing, or anything that you have need of, He's ready to write it tonight. Is that right? Your deposit was made at Calvary. Anything that you have need of, He's there to make it right before God. Oh, no wonder we're happy people. No wonder we can rejoice in the God of our salvation, for He's marvelous and wonderful.

L-23 Now, in His reading--or in the writing, rather, we read this, in the book of Saint Matthew the 9th chapter, and the 18th and the 26th verse inclusive: And while he spake these things unto them, behold, there came a certain ruler, and worshipped him--worshipped him, saying, My daughter is even now dead: but come... lay thy hands upon her, and she shall live. (Oh, I like that. See? Come... lay Your hand upon her. Now, he was a Jew talking to Jesus.) And Jesus arose, and followed him, and so did his disciples. And, behold, a woman which was diseased with an issue of blood twelve years, came behind him, and touched the hem of his garment: For she said within herself, If I may but touch his garment, I shall be whole.

L-24 Now, listen to the Scripture, not the promise that you have. But she said in her heart, "If I touch His garment, I will be whole." See? Now, you have more than that. You have a Divine promise. Is that right? You have a Divine promise, and a Divine gift here in your midst now. Just look how much more you've got to believe by than what that poor woman had. She didn't even have a Scripture for that. And the Scripture said, "These signs shall follow them that believe; if they lay their hands on the sick, they shall recover." That's a promise. But she didn't have no promise, but she believed it anyhow. Watch. But Jesus turned him about, and when he saw her, he said, Daughter, be of good comfort; thy faith has made thee whole. And the woman was made whole from that hour. And... Jesus came into the ruler's house, and saw the minstrels and the people making a noise, And he said unto them, Give place: for the maid is not dead, but sleepeth. And they laughed him to scorn. But when the people were put forth, he went in, and took her by the hand, and the maid arose. And the fame thereof went abroad in all that land.

L-25 God bless His Word there, said, "It shall not return to Me void, but it'll accomplish that which it was purposed for. See? Your faith in God's Word brings the result. The little ruler... Let's think--let's think he was a fellow that... He--he probably separated himself from the believers, because that the big church that day did not believe Him. They didn't believe in Him. "Why, He's nothing but a--an impostor." But what if those fellows could come out of hell tonight and come back up. They'd want to believe on Him. They know now He's the Son of God. They knowed then It was their visitation, but It's too far... Now, don't you let that be your 50-0823, Testimony, Tent Meeting, Cleveland, OH, 78 min excuse; you believe now. Believe now.

L-26 Now, remember when Jesus was on earth, He was considered a fanatic, being against churches. And He was called a spiritualist, Beelzebub. Is that right? One knows who Beelzebub was, the devil, big fly, scared the other flies off the platform, Beelzebub. They called, in other words, He was a spiritualist. He was doing all these things by spiritualism, or some wicked devil or something. [Blank.spot.on.tape--Ed.] Separated himself from the believers went out...?... [Blank.spot.on.tape--Ed.]...?... That right?

L-27 Now, just have faith and believe. Now, this little ruler, he separated himself from the believers and went out to stay with the rest of them. And... But there come a need; his girl got sick. Well, he probably called the doctor, and the doctor done all he could do. But the girl got sicker and sicker. And after awhile, the breath left her; she's gone, a child about twelve years old, presumingly. But now, the girl was to be sick. All hopes was gone; the doctor couldn't give no hope. Now, he had to get to Jesus. That's sometimes the way God has to get people, 'fore they'll believe Him. Isn't that right? They had to get to Jesus. I can hear somebody say, "Well, that fellow, that Nazarene, that fanatic over there that's doing that healing, that Divine healer, why don't you call Him?" "Well, the... I'll get put out of the synagogue if I have anything to do with Him." See, He was considered a quack. And brother, all the people that's ever lived like God, or been in God's program, has been considered heretics, quacks, fanaticism. Some--some others may be. That's true. Probably some of it--some of it may be.

L-28 But just as sure as there is a false; there is a true. See? There has to be a good dollar before a bogus dollar can be made off of it. Isn't that right? If--if it wasn't, why, the bogus would be real. So now, it's up to your discernment. If it's according to the Scripture, working against your life, then you believe it. "For no man can do a miracle in My Name and speak light of Me. Isn't that what Jesus said? That's right. And these signs shall follow them that believe: the nine spiritual gifts, operating, moving in the Body which was promised by Jesus Christ. See?

L-29 But the world has got off and got so formal and indifferent, till they just had their own set ways, their own rituals, their own creeds and so forth. And if you don't come right up to that, you're not in it. See? That's the way the churches are today. You've got to come right up and look through my glasses or you don't see at all. See? Now, you got. Now, God doesn't limit Hisself to any church. No, He doesn't. Remember, when the disciples got to thinking one time that they were the only ones, the only ones, Jesus, the very next day sent out seventy others. Is that right? God never wants anyone to build anything around themselves. All glory goes to Jesus Christ, the Son of God. See? So we mustn't try to think of ourselves, or our church. We must spread out our arms and look for God. That's right.

L-30 Now, when you see anything, search it, look through it. "Well," did Jesus say, "if you'd have knowed Me, you would've knowed My days. Didn't Isaiah speak of Me and so forth?" Now, all the prophets spoke of this day. Isn't that right? These things would be taking place in this day. And said in the last days, scoffers would come. Is that right? Now, look the way He said the spirits would--or the Spirit speak--spake, that in the last days, people would be. They'd be heady. You know what heady means? High-minded, lovers of pleasure more than lovers of God. Look at these arenas and things over here, the stadiums: Sundays and everything else, they fill up the picture shows and the dance halls. Lovers of pleasure more than lovers of God, truce breakers, incontinent, fierce, and despisers of those that are good... Holy-rollers, hillbillies, and everything else... See...?... Despisers of those that are good. Not as we are good. But my, there's none good but God. But God is in the people what makes them good, marks the perfect man. It's God in you that makes it perfect. See? "Be ye therefore perfect, even as your Father in heaven is perfect." See? "Be ye therefore perfect." How can you be perfect? Not in yourself, but in Him. God don't look at you then; He looks at Him. Well, you say, "I'm in Him." How do you get in Him? By one Spirit we're all baptized into one Body, and then you're in Him, when you're baptized by the Holy Spirit into the Body: I Corinthians 12. Is that true? Then in Him... 50-0823, Testimony, Tent Meeting, Cleveland, OH, 78 min

L-31 Now, "heady, high-minded, lovers of pleasure more than lovers of God, truce breakers, false accusers, incontinent, fierce, and despisers of those that are good, having a form of godliness..." not church...?... The people go to church, Sunday school, confession: "Having a form of godliness, but denying the power thereof, from such turn away." Is that what the Bible says? Now, remember, there was emphasis put on that. The Spirit speaks expressingly, that in the latter days, these days. Express time of the--that prophecy to be fulfilled is now in the latter days. There we are. We're here. "Having a form of godliness but denying the power thereof; from such, turn away. For this is the sort that goes from house to house and leads silly women, laden away with divers lusts:" Sewing circles, and kitchen circles, and soup suppers. Now, I--I hope that don't hurt any of you. But brothers, when it comes to a time at my Tabernacle, which I may have to return someday, but if it gets to the time that we have to boil chickens and sell it for fifty cents a plate to pay the preacher, I'll quit preaching. That's exactly right. And that means sewing circles where they stitch and sew, and sew-and-sew, and talk about Miss. So-and-so. That's--that's about the way it ends up. That's right.

L-32 When I was a meter reader, I went into a basement where they was having some kind of a thing like that. And the jokes that a drunken sailor wouldn't tell, them women were telling up there. They didn't know I was a preacher. I was reading the meter. And I went up and knocked on the door. And they come to the door, and all of them in there smoking cigarettes and going on. I said, "Ladies, the..." I said, "I may get fired for this, but all right." I said, "Do you mean to tell me that you all are here in a religious worship, when I heard some of you repeat a prayer awhile ago?" Said, "This is our circle sewing something." I said "And the jokes that you're telling, aren't..." She said, "You're supposed to be reading the meter." I said, "I'm a Gospel preacher. And I'm on my Father's business all the time." That's right. I said... And I knelt down in the room and had prayer in the room, and that broke up that sew-and-sew circle after that. That's right. And I asked God to save that bunch of sinners. That's--that's right. I don't know whether it had any effect or not; I may have to wait until eternity, but I did my part. Right. Oh, my. "Having a form of godliness but denying the power thereof, from such, turn away." Get away from it. Stay away from it. Get out to God, and pray through to God, and stay right with God. Live for God.

L-33 I--I... Usually in my services... Anybody's been in other services know; I never speak to people like this. It's not... But I feel the time has come, friends, when something's got to be said. See see? If God has performed these things, and then if God is the--is--it's true, we know He is, and can perform these things, the Holy Spirit's telling me to say these things. I don't know why is to say these things. And friends, turn away from your ways of just halfway Chri--there is no halfway Christians. You're just fooling yourself. See? You're--you're either a Christian or a sinner. You never... As I said, you never did see a drunk sober man. You're either drunk or sober. Did you ever see a black white bird? Either black or white. See? And you're either right with God or wrong with God. That's right. And the only way you can be right with God is being borned again. Jesus said, "Except a man be borned again, he can't see the Kingdom of God." No matter what he's done, how many good deeds he's done; he's got to be borned again. Then when he's borned again, he can understand what it's all about. Now, God bless you, ever keep you is my prayer.

L-34 We're going to have the prayer line just in a moment. Time now so we can run an hour and a half or more in the prayer line, or as long as we possibly can. Thanks again, all of you. I guess you're wondering why I stopped, didn't you? I--I know it's time to stop, for the One Who watches over me has moved to the platform. And I know when it's time to quit. All right. It's time for the prayer service.

L-35 Let us bow our heads. Our heavenly Father, I don't know why You wanted me to stop just at this time. I had other things to say, and the little story to tell about the--the case of healing. But Thou has spoke, and I--I want to obey. Bless, dear Father, now, the services. May Your Spirit move over this audience in a great marvelous way. Father, may 50-0823, Testimony, Tent Meeting, Cleveland, OH, 78 min men and women setting here tonight, may they just shut off themselves from all other thoughts but You. May they forget about the work that they've got to do tomorrow, or the things that they did today. May they live for this hour that's coming on now, that it--as though it might be the last hour that they live on the earth. May they be thinking only of Christ standing here at the platform, oh, in His majesty and His great holiness, see Him standing here, a Man of sorrow, acquainted with grief, bowed down His head, the Lamb of God. He was smitten, bruised. And He was a Lamb led to the slaughter. And oh, how that His trembling hands, and His quivering flesh, when they nailed the nails, and when they pulled the thorns down over His brow, and the Blood run down into His eyes... How I long to stand where Mary stood and John at the foot of the cross, and let the Blood cover me.

L-36 O God, we're now at--coming close to the close of this lovely little meeting here we had, Your children expecting You. We know it's the devil's business to get around the people, say, "Well, we'll just wait. We'll find out." O God, that's what he did in the days when You were here in flesh, caused the people to be deceived and walked away, and forgot God, and reaped the great harvest afterwards. Father, may men and women not neglect tonight. But may they come and accept Thee, Who we love and are cherishing, and are giving all praise and glory. And may Your gift, the great Angel of God that stood to the right of Thy humble servant, that spoke and sent these things, and confirms it in the eyes of thousands. O eternal God, may He come tonight with great power and blessings and minister to each and every one here, Lord. May many be healed tonight because of His Presence. And God shall be given all glory, and all praise will be given to the great holy infinite Son of God. For we ask it in the Name of Jesus. Amen.

L-37 Now, every one be just as reverent, as possibly you can be while we're having this time of prayer service...?... [A brother calls the prayer line--Ed.] Only believe, All things are possible, only believe; Only believe, only believe, All things are possible, only believe. Only believe, only believe, All things are possible, only believe; Only believe, only believe, All things are possible, only believe. Your card called for that, sonny boy? Does your card call for there? No. I can...?... didn't have your card; I was going to say... get some of the ushers and bring you...?... All right, now, just a moment. [Blank.spot.on.tape--Ed.]... not long ago...

L-38 How many knows who wrote that song? Paul Rader. Oh, how... What a gallant soldier. I was acquainted with Brother Rader. I knew him. He belonged the Baptist church. Hear of his death when he died... I telephoned him not long ago...?... great warrior. The little Moody Bible school broadcast was down there singing, they tell me, at his... So they had all the curtains pulled down in the room, the shades. And they were sing in there, singing, "Nearer My God To Thee," and something. And Brother Rader was quite a cut-up. You know how he was. He looked around; he said, "Who's dying, you or I?" Said, "Raise up those curtains." Said, "Sing some good old fashion Gospel songs." So they started singing "All Hail The Power Of Jesus' Name," and...?... So Luke was standing there, his brother. I guess you knew Luke. Called Luke up to his side and said, "Luke, we've been a long ways together. But to think of it, five minutes from now I'll be standing in the Presence of Jesus Christ, clothed in His righteousness." Closed his eyes and went to meet God. A few weeks ago, I was at Fort Wayne Gospel Tabernacle where we were having a service. And in there... I never had heard the song before. A night or two after the Angel of the Lord appeared to me and commissioned me, I was in--walked into my church, my pianist was over there playing, "Only Believe." And I said, "Play that again." The Angel of the Lord seemed to like that. 50-0823, Testimony, Tent Meeting, Cleveland, OH, 78 min

L-39 "Only Believe," and I think of that epileptic being brought to Jesus, He said, "I can, if you can just believe, for all things are possible." That's... I'd played it. It's been our campaign theme song all along. One night there at Fort Wayne, I was setting up there, way up in Brother Rediger's study. How many ever heard of B. E. Rediger, Fort Wayne Gospel Tabernacle. You knew...?... Romaine then, didn't you. Romaine, now she's be married this month. She'd been...?... psychiatrist... She begin...?... One of her--her sister died the same way.

L-40 And I come down one day at home, and they... So many hundreds of people gather around on the outside, I couldn't hardly get in. When they was bringing me back out, my brother, or somebody said, "Well, won't you come back here in your coal shed? Mrs. Rediger's back there in your coal shed." I said, "What Rediger? B. E. from Fort Wayne?" Said, "Yes." He's been dead for years. Well, not dead, gone to glory. He was a warrior of faith. I believe he was pressing on, and God had to move him off the scene. He'd got into this time here. He's going on with God. Then what happened? I said, "B. E. Rediger's daughter?" Said, "Yes, but she's been in this condition for about two years now." And I went back there. You'll never know how I felt when I seen Mrs. Rediger. She always had a place in my heart as a real lady. And Mrs. Rediger, setting in my coal shed in the church with her daughter setting there, barren. The anointing had done left me. But standing there thinking of Brother Rediger, in a few moments, it come on. She just set there with her head down, and frothed at the mouth: beautiful young lady. And all at once, the Holy Spirit came down, the Angel of God come near. I said, "Satan, come away from that girl, in the Name of the Lord Jesus." She come back to her right mind, went home normal. She's right now. Was then took care of all the business this summer at the Tabernacle and everything. She gets married this month.

L-41 While setting there in the Fort Wayne Tabernacle there, listening, I heard that song come in, "Only Believe." Right in the same seat where Paul Rader set. Oh, my. Something moved over my heart. Oh, my. He's gone, but his songs live on. Lives of great men all remind us We can make our life sublime, Partings leave behind us Footprints on the sands of time; Let's pray now. Father, I'm thinking of Thy servant Paul Rader, thinking of how he believed You for Divine healing; thinking of Brother Rediger. O God, how each year they climb up there to his grave, them dear precious people at the... His love lingers on in their heart. Many of them want to be buried around him, knowing that someday the grave will come open; he will come out. Across the world, there's many of those dear precious saints of God that Your children has rallied around. Wouldn't it be wonderful if someday, when we all come forth to go to meet each other, and then be caught up in the air to meet the Lord. We're longing for that day, Father, which we know is near. Bless us now tonight as we, this generation, are doing our part to make a path that others might follow behind. Help us, Father, tonight. And now, I realize I'm to stand here before demon powers, and know that they're in this building tonight, circling, haunting against me. But Thou art here, Father, to protect me from all powers of evil. I pray that You'll help me tonight. May every spirit unclean spirit leave the people. May they be made whole in Jesus Christ's Name. Amen. [Blank.spot.on.tape--Ed.]...?...

L-42 Let's see your hand just a moment. I want to talk to you a moment...?... Brother, this is the first case 'course tonight. But I--I believe you have tumor. Isn't that right? Uh-huh, tumor... It hit like a tumor. And every time I start to make... say something else... It was 'cause I was... I couldn't believe it in my own heart that it was a spirit that would be...?... I couldn't hardly think in my own heart that that young fellow would have a tumor. I thought it might be something else, some other something. But it--it wasn't. It--it's a tumor. And the spirit, every time I'd start to say something, it'd feel it 50-0823, Testimony, Tent Meeting, Cleveland, OH, 78 min break up tumor, tumor, tumor. And I just couldn't hardly... I'm ashamed of myself, and apologize before God. But that's what it--what it is. It's tumor.

L-43 Now, young man, only God can heal you. You know that, don't you? You're just a laddie boy. You want to serve Him, don't you, brother? Will you do it if He will let you get well? And you'll serve Him all your life? God bless you. Let us bow our head. Father, I ask Thee to be merciful to our brother. He's in need, O God, of being healed. Bless him now, and may the Spirit of the Lord be upon him to make him well. May this evil power that's on him, may it leave and go away. May he be healed in the Name of Jesus Christ. Now, just a moment, audience, it holds to him. Now, you may raise your head just a moment if you want. I want you to see something here, young man, to increase your faith. You're nervous...?... Try to think your own thoughts. You know what I mean? Your own... Now, watch. I want you to take your hand off of mine. I want you to look here at my hand, my arm. Just looks like yours or any other man's, doesn't it? Let's have your hand over here just a moment. See how, doesn't have any effect at all on my hand there, does it? Now, take your other hand, lay it on there. Now, watch what happens now: Starts swelling. Those things, see it run across there, them little things? That's what we call--what I call the vibrations.

L-44 Sometimes you pick it up in the air from demon powers. Don't you think but what there's several of them here tonight too. That's right. Now, it ain't going to do you no good to try your best... And you know who I'm talking about, try to throw anything up this a way, because God will put it back on you. Remember that. The young man is sick. Now, if that leaves, you're going to be well. If it doesn't leave, of course, I... If--if you probably want it... Now, only your faith...

L-45 Now, I want you to come here just a...?... I want you to watch real close now, and I'm going to pray again and ask it to leave. And if it leaves and turns normal... Now, watch. Just move that hand off to yourself, this hand. Now, see, goes back normal. Now, lay your other hand just the way that one was, just the same way. Now, it isn't. Of course, that to me doesn't mean anything. It's the discernment what means to me. Laying your hand on there, as my hand to swell and turn all kinds of colors, and white things or ever what it was run across it wouldn't mean nothing there. The--the mystery of the part to what the God part is, to tell you what's wrong with you. Isn't that right? But now, watch and lay this hand on there a minute. There's what you can see yourself. Now, I'll try to hold my hand just as still as I... See, it isn't the position my hand's in. You can see it, young man, just the same anywhere. See that just run across there? That's your tumor. Now, it's that live multiplication of cells. It's got a life in it, moving across there, just "Thrrrr, thrrr..." [Brother Branham illustrates.--Ed.]

L-46 Now, I'm... I want you to watch my hand and believe with all your heart that you're going to get well. See? And you say you will promise God that you're going to serve Him and everything. All right. Will you bow your heads again, now everyone, while the boy watches hisself. Our heavenly Father, be merciful to the young man. The enemy is trying to hold, but You're more than a match for the enemy. Now, help us, dear God, to have faith to believe You. And now, Lord, we come to You with childlike faith, believing that You are, and a rewarder of those who will seek You. And now, I plead around this platform the Blood of the Lord Jesus, that we might be hedged in, that the Spirit of God may have preeminence, might be able to cast out evil spirits, and to make these people well. O, thou demon, that's bound the boy, in the Name of the Lord Jesus Christ, come out from him. There it goes.

L-47 Now, young man. Before I look at my hand myself, something's happened, hasn't it? Audience may raise their head if they desire. All right. Now, I'll raise mine. Now, look brother, something happened, didn't it? The tumor died. Now, watch. Now, see the way your hand is now? That's just exactly the same way I had mine. Now, put this hand over here. Just like it was. Now, this hand... You see when you put that on there, it would swell up, turn real dark, and little white things would run across it like that. Is that right? Now, put it on there now and see what happens. God bless you, brother. Let's say, "Praise the Lord," everybody. Just have faith and believe. 50-0823, Testimony, Tent Meeting, Cleveland, OH, 78 min

L-48 All right. Come on, brother. Now, see, it takes faith. If--if--if thou canst believe, all things are possible. Howdy do, sister. Can you believe? All right. Let's have your hand... Yes, ma'am. You have more than one disease...?... [Blank.spot.on.tape--Ed.] Yes ma'am. That shows in a vibrations can... trying to cross there...?... Watch when you take your hand off, look at my hand now. Put your hand over here on mine. Now, put this hand here on there and watch it. [Blank.spot.on.tape--Ed.] Now, put this hand here on there and watch it. There you are. Now, look at this. Oh, I see you have more than one. You have arthritis too, don't you? You have... See, arthritis is acid in the blood like...?... This is the turn of the...?... But I was looking there, and seen a little...?... in there...?... All right. Do you believe now with all your heart?

L-49 Will the audience bow their...?... Heavenly Father, to the sacredness of knowing that You're here, and knowing that the Blood of Jesus cleanses from all sins, evils, all sickness, and afflictions, and diseases, through faith, believing. Now, Lord, have mercy upon our sister. She's suffering and standing here, knowing that these things has been revealed to her. I'm asking this blessing. Help me to have faith for her, and with her, that the enemy might loose her, then that her testimony might be great, that she'd go out and tell others, and lead others to Christ. Hear the prayer of Your servant. Thou demon, in the Name of the Lord Jesus Christ, leave the woman. All right, sister. Look this a way. It leaves you. Go free. Wait, put your hand back again. Raise your feet up-and-down. Go off the platform just rejoicing, being happy; for Christ heals you and makes you well. Let's say, "Praise the Lord." [Congregation says, "Praise the Lord."--Ed.] Oh, He wants to heal many tonight. All right. Now, if I can just keep--just myself settled, as close as possible. That helps. Now, everybody be in prayer.

L-50 And you out there in the prayer line: how many out there has got these cards, or hasn't got cards, that's trying now to be healed? All right. Just try... Now, the thing for you to do is this. You ask our heavenly Father. And if He... Sometimes I don't see It; I feel It. It'll let loose. But I... Then I don't get it. See? I can't tell just who it was, but it leaves. And then I--I wondered where it was. But I'm trying awfully hard for you. I'm doing all that I know how, under a difficult tonight, real difficult. Now, be in prayer.

L-51 Come forward, sister. Here...?... Look this way. Yes, ma'am. You have many... Been failing lately, haven't you? Oh, I see another thing. You have stomach trouble too, don't you? Yes, ma'am. I see the two of them. You're nervous too, aren't you. Is that right? A palsy like... All right. Do you believe now that Jesus is going to... [Blank.spot.on.tape--Ed.] be normal? You do that? Let us bow our heads. The lady's a Christian and a believer. Our heavenly Father, Who brought again Jesus, Thy Son, from the dead, and setting at the right-hand of Thy majesty tonight, making intercessions for us poor unworthy creatures of the earth, calling to us to come unto Thee, "All ye that labor and heavy laden; I'll give you rest." Rest from our worries, rest from our sickness, rest from our sins, just give us rest. "He that cometh to Me I will in no wise cast out." Now, sister here, oh how she needs You tonight. Go at the table, can't eat... But You can make her well, Father, if she just let that faith loose. Satan, thou tormentor, come out of the woman in the Name of the Lord Jesus. Look this way, sister. It leaves you now. Go eat what you want to. Diabetes has left you. Let's say, "Praise the Lord." [Congregation says, "Praise the Lord."--Ed.]...?... Everyone just as reverent as you can be for a moment.

L-52 I understand she's...?... Yes. Tumor, is that right? Now, you'll believe? Let's bow our heads. Our heavenly Father, be merciful to this poor woman. Grant, Lord, that she may be healed of this tumor. And I ask You to be merciful. Grant it, that here she's to have it removed, maybe to die in the operation. But Thou art here, Father, to remove it for her. Take all this from her. Help her now to be healed in the Name of Thy Son, Jesus. Amen. It just doesn't leave. Just a moment. It didn't leave her. See, you see it running on my hand like that. Satan, in the Name of the Lord Jesus, come out from the woman. Seems to hold. Everybody just keep your heads bowed. I want to talk to you. Now, you look at me. Do you--do you live far? Not very far. There's something... See, the tumor's making a act, some way. But there's something causing it to keep it from leaving. You believe me to be a person that's...?... too, worked hard in life...?... 50-0823, Testimony, Tent Meeting, Cleveland, OH, 78 min

L-53 That's what it is...?... You know that's right, sister. You--but you've had a desire to do that, recently, more than ever in the last two or three weeks. You been praying about that, asking God if He'd take you back. Isn't that right? One time you tried to commit suicide. Isn't that right? That's right. But now, you've gotten away. This thing's come to bring you back to the Lord. Isn't that true? I'm not reading your mind, but I'm seeing a vision. Is that the truth? Will you promise then that you'll return to God, and will serve Him all your life and live... You will? You promise it? All right, bow your head. Our heavenly Father, our beloved sister standing here, who's once knew You and wandered away, and now the secret sin of her life is revealed to her, the thing that's caused her to wander away. And now, down through that channel of time, days passed by, You've come and revealed it to her. Lord, she's coming back. Will You receive her tonight right here at the platform? A commemoration and of the hour. Thank You, Father. Thank You. God bless you, sister. Your sins are forgiven you. Your body is healed. Now, go and sin no more.

L-54 All right. Sometimes you might wonder why those things are, what does this. The lady, guess you could hear from here, she--what she done when she was a little girl, and then when she once knew God and wandered away from God, and how, it's about two weeks ago, how she wanted to ask God, tried to pray and get back. She'd never even come back to the full realization of Christ till just now. And when she... It would not leave her until first that was revealed to her, and told to her. Then it left her, and the tumor died and went away. Friends, the Almighty is here in His Person. All right, it's a deaf spirit on the woman. All right. Bow your heads just a moment...?... Jesus, the Son of God, Who cannot fail. The heavens and earth may pass, but Thy Word cannot pass. You promised these things, and we're happy to be living in the day to see them come to pass. And now, as our sister standing here, Satan has put a deaf spirit on her, maybe to cause her to be deaf, walk out before a moving vehicle somewhere and be killed. Ailments of her body set in, Lord... with faith, believe. Oh help, dear Father, that she may be healed this night. Thou demon, come out of the woman in the Name of the Lord Jesus...?... real...?... It's all over and gone, sister. Could you hear what the diagnosis was? All right. The lady's perfectly hearing. I asked her if she could hear. I told her of her... She had arthritis, trouble in her back, and she had tonsils--bad tonsils in her throat. Is that right, lady? Now, you can hear me all right? Now, watch this: say, "Praise the Lord." [The sister says, "Praise the Lord."--Ed.] Praise the Lord. [The sister says, "Praise the Lord."--Ed.] You're perfectly normal and well. Go on off the platform rejoicing. Let's say, "Praise the Lord," everybody. [Congregation says, "Praise the Lord."--Ed.] All right. Everybody be reverent.

L-55 Howdy do, sister. Come just a little closer if you will, sister. Now, as you come, come believing. There's something wrong with you, or you wouldn't be here. Sister, I perceive that you're a good woman. Would you believe me if I tell you something? You would believe me and accept it? You would? All right. The female trouble you had is already left you, sister. God bless you...?... All right. Let us... Everybody be reverent now. Now, everybody just as reverent as you can. All right, sister. I don't know what happened to you, but as I turned around, a white flash come by you. You're healed. Go off the platform...?... Now, that was about the second time that ever happened in--in my ministry. The girl got healed just as soon as she started--started across the platform. Let's say, "Praise the Lord." That's the way I like to see it do. [Congregation says, "Praise the Lord."--Ed.] Now, as she got here, her faith just...

L-56 Young lady, did you have extremely lot of faith when you come up there, believing you was going to be healed? Did you believe it with all your heart? Was you praying or something to be healed? That--that--that's a mystery to me. I don't understand it, but I seen a Light flash around you. I knew you was--you were healed. God had blessed you. Do you feel all right now? She heard me. Oh, yes, ma'am. That... Let's say, "Praise the Lord," everybody. [Congregation says, "Praise the Lord."--Ed.] All right. Everybody just as reverent as you can be now.

L-57 All right. Come ahead. Now, you're a stranger to me, aren't you. You're a stranger. I'm not too sure of this, sister. If you'd just come a little close so I could talk to you a little. Now, do not fear. Of course, you have a strange feeling now. 50-0823, Testimony, Tent Meeting, Cleveland, OH, 78 min Yes, ma'am. That--that's nothing to hurt you. It's the Presence of the Lord Jesus. It made you well of what was wrong. I--I want you to look this way just a moment. You're extremely nervous right now of course, and you don't... For one thing, I know you don't have a good circulation of blood. There's something concerning your blood that's wrong. Now, I can't tell just what it is, but your blood circulation is--is not right. But I can't tell it. It's not... It's something that's happened. And I believe it's something lacking in the blood. (See?) And instead of being something that--that's a disease... Yes. It's a desire in your heart for something, isn't it. God bless you, woman. The... Listen. You're desiring a child, aren't you. Isn't that right? Yes, ma'am. There's something wrong with the blood. I know. See? The--the blood is not fertile. But God makes your blood fertile, sister. O Jesus, Son of God, poor little trembling woman, walk up here like that. As much child birth control is going on in the world today, and a mother, a woman walked up like this and desire children. God bless this woman, who I bless, and may she receive the desire of her heart. In the Name of the Lord Jesus Christ, Your humble servant begs for this woman. Amen. Bless you, my sister.

L-58 Let us say, "Praise be to God, Who gives us victory." That was kinda little puzzling me, there was something wrong in the blood stream that was causing that condition. But God is here to move everything. God is the Giver of Life. I had an extremely lot of confusion the other day about someone. A little girl setting there has done been healed of deafness. Just brought her card over and give it to her, setting right there. When I turned awhile ago and spoke about it... Let's say, "Praise the Lord." [Congregation says, "Praise the Lord."--Ed.] God bless you, sister. That's very good. Just wonderful. Mother, you setting there (Amen.), you're in serious trouble, aren't you, mother? You believe me as God's servant? It's some... Why, it's a...?... also, but I believe that it's you. Don't... You've had...?... a tumor, malignant tumor? Do you believe with all your heart? Do you believe if I'd--if I'd asked God to bless you, you'd be healed? May God grant you your desires.

L-59 The young lady that brought you there also. You're sick also, sister. That's... You're her daughter. Isn't that right? I see. And don't you have a cyst trouble? Isn't that right? God bless you. May the Lord Jesus grant you your desire, both of you, both mother and daughter. And go home and be well...?... Oh, let's say, "Thank the Lord." They putting their arms around each other. Our heavenly Father, may this blessing that Thy servant has asked for them, that mother and daughter, may they receive their blessing. May they go out, Lord, believing the Angel's Message that said, "Nothing shall stand before the prayer." May they be healed, each one, in the Name of the Lord Jesus, I pray. All right. How do you do, sister. Now, just a moment. Come just a little closer. Well, you have several things wrong with you. There's some connection with this woman and someone else in here. Now, there's associate spirits. Now, be reverent, everywhere. It's in this vicinity, right in here, somewhere. This woman's before the gift. Now, I don't know what's wrong with her. She--she's got many things. But it just keeps pulling right across this a way, the two between there. It's a... It's somebody in here that's sick the same way she is.

L-60 Now, now, just a moment. I wish you could feel what that is. Just, oh, I want to say, "Hallelujah." Look this a way, sister. Believe now with all your heart. You have heart trouble for one thing. Isn't that right? Let us pray. Our heavenly Father, be merciful, Lord. This woman has number one enemy: heart trouble, and know she can't stay very long without Your help. No physician can ever have anything to do with heart trouble, only the One Who lives in the heart, Christ Jesus. God, bless her. May she be healed of this heart trouble. Satan, you who bound her, come out of her in the Name of Jesus Christ. Now, your heart's back to normal. Go on your road rejoicing and be happy. There it is. Amen. Amen.

L-61 Let's say, "Praise the Lord." [Congregation says, "Praise the Lord."--Ed.] Now, I know they're--that woman was... 50-0823, Testimony, Tent Meeting, Cleveland, OH, 78 min See those two spirits? How that Jesus Christ can heal anything, can't He? Isn't He the Lord Jesus? Now, there's heart trouble just flashing in here everywhere now, because that sets faith afire. You see? Now, just... See? I don't know just where it is. The call on heart trouble, there's very much of it. That's all right, sister. Amen. Let's say, "Praise the Lord," everybody. See? See? He's here to heal. That's His healing blessing. Everybody be just--just be praising the Lord...?... you're thankful for His goodness. Accept it. Always just accept it and be... Isn't He marvelous? Now, there's a lot of heart trouble I see... You keep praying now.

L-62 And bring here the next lady in. You want to be healed? Yeah, just keep believing. Yes, ma'am. You're extremely nervous, aren't you? Nerve trouble got you all broke up, have all kind of thoughts and everything. Isn't that right? O Jesus, Son of God, set this woman free from this enemy that's binding her.
