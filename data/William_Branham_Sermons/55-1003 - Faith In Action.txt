--- TRANSCRIPT ---

L-1 Only believe, only believe, All things are possible, only believe. Shall we remain standing just a moment for prayer. Our heavenly Father, we bow our heads and give Thee thanks for all the goodness, mercies that Thou has bestowed upon us, knowing that we are unworthy of anything that You'd do for us. To think that one time we were alienated from You without hope, without mercy without God, without Christ, in this world, living for the enemy of our soul, and one day Jesus found us and saved us and cleansed us from a life of sin and give us the Holy Spirit and set us in the service for God.

L-2 O Father, some glorious day He shall come the second time and we which are alive and remain shall not prevent them which are asleep. For the trumpet of God shall sound and the dead in Christ shall rise first. And we which are alive shall be caught up together with them to meet the Lord in the air and forever be with the Lord. What a day, our hopes is built on nothing less than Jesus Blood and righteousness. We are looking forward to the coming of the great King. Now, we've gathered here in Chicago tonight, Father, in this auditorium to glorify Him to lift up our voices and praise Him, to sing songs, teach His Word, and to pray for our sick people who are in the journey. Won't You meet with us, Father, and bless us in these things. We ask humbly for these blessings in Jesus' Name. Amen. May be seated. Good evening to all our family. We are happy to be here tonight to meet you and greet you in the Name of the Lord Jesus. I didn't think there'd be anybody back tonight after such a--a wobble as I made last evening. I'm... When you don't follow the Holy Spirit, you always get in trouble, don't you?

L-3 I was standing back behind the curtain listening to that marvelous song, and something said to me, now's the time to speak to you on the subject of, "Watchman, What of the Night" then I got out here and thought about something else, and well, I--I kept you too long. So I'm sorry of it. But tonight, maybe the Lord by His Divine grace and--and foreknowledge will clear the thing up and give us a great pouring out of His blessings tonight.

L-4 We're happy for the Lord Jesus. And today I met many a good friends and met some minister brothers that I've never met before in my life. And now, tonight we won't keep you long, 'cause we've got several nights yet until next Sunday night, God willing, in the service. And I'm grateful to you people who come out to hear the services, and to hear this wonderful singing that we're having, and worship our Lord Jesus, and to fellowship around His Word and around His blessings that He bestows upon us.

L-5 And it seemingly, that I was talking to some brother today and he said, earlier this morning, he said, "Brother Branham, do you feel like you ought to start some big services here in America?" I said, "No, the first thing, if you start big services, you're going to have to have big things to cope with that service. You're going have to have a radio and television programs and so forth, the way the modern American... I'd rather keep my meetings small so I won't have to have much money to take care of it and just meet with little groups here and there."

L-6 Now, in the--the event that... For years now, for the past eight or nine years I been going around through America and different parts of the world a preaching. And the Lord's gave a gift that was made manifest, 'course it was given when the very hour I was born, and you know the story of it. And that is just as true; it's been tested in every fiery furnace the devil could throw it in around the world everywhere. And seemingly, in America it's become a common thing; people go say, "Oh, why, I seen that done before. (See?) Oh, I know about it." But the big kickback comes is, "Why, Brother Branham don't pray for enough people." That's where it's always it comes back. No need a going to his meeting, 'cause, oh, he will get twenty or thirty a night something like that. The rest of them will go home without being prayed for." 55-1003, Faith In Action, Lane Tech High School, Chicago, IL, 79 min

L-7 Well, some fellow wrote me a letter here not long ago, a good critical letter, which was good. I appreciate it, 'cause it told me where I stand. He said, "Brother Branham, I been following your meetings for a long time." He said, "And I think your meetings are wonderful, never seen anything like it in my life." He said, "But you know, you're so lazy," he said, said, "God had to raise up Oral Roberts and others to pray for His sick children." He said, said, "You'll pray for about thirty and they'll pack you away from the pulpit," and said, "then you're finished until the next day, and nobody can see you," said, "People believe what you're talking about; get down there and pray for them." "Well," I thought, "Well, that's pretty good, you know; I guess that's all right; maybe there's a whole lot a truth to that."

L-8 So a few days ago since we come back from Germany... And now, over in the old country in Germany and around the other parts of the world, oh, my, why, first meeting night, you can expect anywhere from thirty, to fifty, a hundred, and two hundred thousand people at one gathering. Thousands are healed at one time. Just soon as they see something happen, that settles it; they're ready and... But in America we've got too much teaching; we got too much different teaching. One says you know...

L-9 Like the other day there was a great conference went on here. I don't know whether many of you know about it or not, among some church people who had visit all the meetings, and they... of the healing services and so forth, so they was met at conference and was going to draw up their conclusions of what they come to, and one of them said, "What do you think about Mr. Allen?" "The biggest radic' I ever seen," said the group. Said, "What do you think about Oral Roberts?" Said, "Mass psychology." Said, "What about William Branham?" Said, "A polished soothsayer." That was the truth. How can you expect to do much around there? See? See, Jesus Himself couldn't work in an audience like that. When, He... You've got to believe it; that's all. And when He went to His own country, there was many mighty works that He could not do because of their unbelief. Later on in the week, I want to explain that to you. And at Chicago, I want to do something I haven't done for years, if God willing.

L-10 The other day... I usually go by when I have a vision, but this time it wasn't a vision; it was just something impressed me. I was setting in the woods. I'd been out there for eight or ten days, just go--come in at nighttime about nine o'clock, go back next morning about four, just to keep away from the public and to rest and pray. And setting there, it seemed like something come to me. I said, "Lord, why is it... Now, I can't go overseas; I've got to have some kind of a sponsorship. I can't go over there take up money from them people, so they're poor. And the American public has to sponsor it, and I have to come back and have a year or two's meetings, then go over and spend what I got, and then come back and take some more meetings." I said, "I don't know, seemingly, then if you leave America your services go down then it's--it's finished for awhile, looks like. And it's so hard to build back again." And Something said to me, "But you haven't done what I told you to do." See? And I said, "Well--well, what is it." Now, I was just answered myself back. Now, just let myself relax and let the Spirit do the talking. Now, it wasn't a vision; I don't even say it was a revelation. I don't know. Just something looked like telling me. And said, "Well, what happened..." See? I said, "Well, didn't You tell me to go do this?" And I've watched and kept it. And Mr. Baxter told me one time... Now, when the--the Angel of the Lord first met me, He said, "Now, you were born to pray for sick people. And you take this gift to the peoples of the world."

L-11 You've read this testimony over and over, and if you'll check it... Now, them days, to be honest I didn't know that the Scripture said gift instead of gifts. But if you'll follow... All I done was wrote down what He said. And many times He tells me things; I just write down what He says, 'cause I don't know what it means. I just write it down, and I find out it comes to pass. And now, I questioned of my ability. He said... I'm not no education, no personality and what could I do; people won't 55-1003, Faith In Action, Lane Tech High School, Chicago, IL, 79 min believe me. And He told me these gifts would be a confirmation, like Moses done signs before the people. And I started off, and I'd start my prayer lines and come down the prayer lines, praying for the sick people, going along; and great things was happening. Many of you remember my early ministry.

L-12 And after while I'd hit a woman or a man or something that wasn't right, I'd stop them right there. And whenever I'd do it, I'd tell the people what was the matter and what you should do and so forth, pass them on and pray for others. Then the people begin to see that done, oh, they rallied for that. And then we just finally cut the whole thing out all to perfect discernment all the time. And that's what He didn't want me to do. And that's right. I'm just supposed to pray for the sick people (That's right.), just pray for the people. And after all you know, if a people... It's especially here at home, if they've have been taught to lay hands on the sick and pray for them, that's what they believe. And you say, "Does that have anything to do with it?" It certainly does.

L-13 Why did Jesus stand here one time look out upon the harvest... How many believes He was the Lord of the harvest? Sure, we all do. And He looked out upon the harvest; He said, "Pray ye, the Lord of the harvest to send laborers into His harvest." Now, in other words, "You ask Me, to do just what I know that's got to be done; but yet, you got to ask Me for it." Said, "You have not because you ask not." Is that right? "You ask not because you believe not."

L-14 A prophet one time had a stick in his hand or a arrow, and he told the king, "Strike the ground," you know. And you know, he only struck it two or three times. Said, "Why didn't you strike it more?" See? And there's certain things that we have to do. And I believe that if I really could get some more people, and pray for them, lay hands on them, and especially in America... I've crossed back and forth across this nation time after time after time, and tens of thousands of things has been done. And miracles signs and so forth has been committed. But it seemingly, I believe if I would just go to a group like this where everybody knows all about it and just pray for the people, then just set back in a day or two and watch what happens; there's got to be some...?... And He said... Look. Listen. Check His Word. "I was born to pray for sick people." See? That was just pray for them. The prayer changes things. Sometimes if they can't--could comprehend it in their mind, prayer changes things. See? And most everyone in America throughout the whole nation knows all about it and everything.

L-15 So some these nights in Chicago, don't know just when, but I want to start and just pray for a whole group of people, bring them up and just... If I can come to the platform and never touch the anointing of that type for discernment, I... After I explain to you how that comes... I never done it publicly. I will maybe tomorrow night or sometime. Then I want to start and just pray for the sick people and check each one, and let them report in twenty four hours, what's happened. And I believe you'll see a great result. The Lord give them His blessings.

L-16 Now, the other day in Germany... How many here has ever seen the picture of the Angel of the Lord that was taken in Houston, let's see your hands, that's here in the building. They got it here, and they were taken in different places. And the other day in Germany it was taken. And now the state church in Switzerland, was against me. They we're against Billy Graham, as you've seen the write up that brother got in the paper. And it... So then after he left, and the reason they was against him, because he believed in the supreme deity of Jesus Christ. Now, the Swiss church doesn't believe that Jesus was the--was the virgin born Son of God. That come from the Zwingli. First was Luther and then come Zwingli and Calvin and so forth. And Zwingli was in Switzerland and they--the state church is--is built upon his doctrine. They believe that he was the--the... In their own books and everything they declare that they believe that he was the Son of Joseph called the Son of God. He was the prophet that Moses spoke of would come, but actually Joseph was His Father. That knocks every prop from under Christianity. It... That takes every Divine thing away from it. He was absolutely the virgin born Son of God, and Joseph had no more to do with it than we had to do with it. That's right. He was the virgin born Son of God. And I believe that with all my heart, soul, mind, and strength.

L-17 And then, I jumped right in behind Billy Graham, and I started the same thing. Oh, my, they bitterly opposed it. And then when they wrote against me, and then give that write up against Billy, then the Catholics come around said, "See, they're both no good." So that... Oh, if people could only get their head right or their heart right, one. So then when they did they went up in Germany, and when we was to come up to Karlsruhe, Germany, they wrote up there to 55-1003, Faith In Action, Lane Tech High School, Chicago, IL, 79 min the state church and told them not to receive me because I was an impostor. So the church and state's together there. What the church says, the state has to do. So they... After they after they had their big cathedral that would seat thousands of people had to build it, 'cause they wouldn't rent no place to them. Then the authorities told them they couldn't have it. Doctor Guggenbuhl, a very smart lawyer (That's one of our sponsors there.), he didn't take "no" for an answer. He went right on down to the Major in the United States Army; he said, "Tell Brother Branham to come on. If the rest of them can come, he can too." So it give me a chance to come into Germany.

L-18 The first night they had to mill around me to keep the Communists from taking a shot at me somewhere. And come pretty near to getting Billy my boy. But the Lord was with us, and they just kept walking around so in the dark they couldn't take a shot you know, 'cause they was firm... And on the second night, God gave sight to a total blind girl, eight years old. Then the state church and their pastors and all got together and wanted to have a meeting with me; they wanted to ask me some questions. We went to a breakfast. And at the breakfast they taken a big German camera and set it up like this up in the day, plenty of light. They needed no flash or nothing. They were taking a pictures of the breakfast.

L-19 And so when they did, they was a... They'd taken several pictures, and they said, "Now, Brother Branham, we believe that God is with you, but them visions, we can't understand it--can't understand it." "Why," I said, "I couldn't explain it, because it's God; and you can't explain God; you've got to believe God. God's not known by--by scientific; God's known by--by faith." Well, they couldn't see that at all, you know. And just at the time (the sovereignty of God right when the strain was on) I said, "Just a moment, here He is now." And I said, "He's coming now." Well, that German camera, they just moved it right on me, and that German thought he'd try a few shots, so he--he took the picture, and when it did the Holy Spirit come down. I said, "The man standing right here to my left, he's a stranger among us all this morning." I said, "He's not a German; neither is a French." I was at Luzanne at the time. I said, "He's not a French, German or a..." I said, "He's an Italian, and he's been the leader of thirty-two thousand communists." And the boy started crying out. And I said, "Now, he's picked up a Bible. His background was Catholic, and he picked up a Bible one day and was reading where Jesus died for his sins, and he accepted Christ. Now, he's persecuted. He's run a little orphanage up in the mountains. He can't eat his breakfast this morning; that's why he pushed his table--the plate back from his table--from the table because he has an ulcer in his stomach." The boy raised his hand, said, "Every word of that's the truth," then he said. I looked at him... He's still... He was gray headed and eating a good square meal." I said, "THUS SAITH THE LORD; eat your meal, because Jesus Christ has made you well." He set right down and started eating.

L-20 Well, that German camera was standing there taking those pictures. And after it left, then they took about a dozen more. They'd taken about a dozen before and a dozen afterwards. And when they developed them, there was the Angel of the Lord right on the picture, coming down...?... Showed Him coming down when He enclosed around where I was standing. The next thing showed where he was going away, looked to be half of it that way, after it was moving away, and I had my hand up saying, "It's THUS SAITH THE LORD; it's finished." Like that. And I have them here tonight so that I can show them to you. I don't know how well you'll be able to see them from the platform here. Sometime we might develop them if we get somebody that'd want them, and we can maybe make negatives from them and put them into print.

L-21 But it just goes to show that every time... I've never had a time, that the gift of God was ever questioned but what God come right down and done something outstanding. So criticism is perfectly welcome. Amen. We--we love to see it, 'cause we're always waiting to see the glory of our Lord God. Now, I've got them here. You may not be able to see; I don't know how good the... Can you see that from where you're--from where I'm standing? It's a--it's a picture of the breakfast. Now, here's all the ministers; the camera's setting back here. See where the lights is in the building, up here and it's eleven o'clock in the day. Doesn't need any--any light 55-1003, Faith In Action, Lane Tech High School, Chicago, IL, 79 min of any type. Now, that's the first picture. And here's where they all stood to their feet, and there's the Angel of the Lord coming down. And here's the man standing; and that's me and my hand pointed towards him, and this is him standing here with the Roman collar on, that's a--that explains to him what it's all about. That's when It's coming, just started down. See it's just above... This is me standing right here, and it's just above me. Now, here's the next picture, when it done settled down over their head like that. It's--it's--it's down over them, and the vision is going on. And here's the next picture when it's leaving away and just half of me can be seen there, where the Angel of the Lord has still got it masked over, just half of it going away. And here's the next picture afterward it's perfectly clear and normal; there's nothing there (See?) after it's gone away. Jesus Christ still lives and reigns. All right.

L-22 Now, that doesn't mean anything to me. These people in the pit here, I never noticed; they didn't get to see it; so I'll kinda show it if you don't mind, just a moment. There's the one before. See, see? that's the picture that was before anything was taken And here is the Angel of the Lord coming down. See, see? And here is the picture after it was already settled on me where I was standing. See? And here's the picture just dwindling away there (See?), and just half of my face is showing where it's going off like that. And if you'll happen to notice, it's going off on the right hand side, and I always call my sick everywhere to the right hand side. The Angel of the Lord always appears to me on the right hand side, every time, and there the... to--to prove that it's true, there goes the Angel of the Lord off on the right hand side, just exactly. And here's a picture afterwards, that there was nothing left in the building. And we got, we got around twenty something pictures between these two things, and... the camera stationary setting at the same place, and nothing at all showed any other wise. So it just goes to show that our dear Lord Jesus still lives and reigns, doesn't He? He's wonderful, exceedingly, abundantly, and we love Him with all of our hearts.

L-23 Now, the Lord be with you... Now, we're not going to try to keep you but just a few minutes tonight, and preach just a little bit, call the prayer line. And then maybe a little later on, you get all of your friends in that wants to be prayed for, and when the masses gets to coming like that, I want to start a prayer line and just come by and--and take that day to visit and shaken hands with Brother Boze and everything and come at the platform that night and just start praying for the sick (That's right.), just come right in and start praying, laying hands on the sick. And I believe if it was God would've answer my prayer like that, it would revolutionize my ministry before God. And--and I believe that that inspiration out in the woods the other day, I solemnly believe with all my heart that God wants me to do it. That--that's the truth. See?

L-24 I want to read a little tonight, just a verse or two out of God's eternal Word, before we start to--to pray for the sick. And we'll try to be out in--in just a little bit so you can come back tomorrow night. Now, in the book of Romans, we read beginning with the 19th verse of the 4th Chapter of Romans: And being not weak in faith, he considered not his own body, now dead when he was about a hundred years old. Neither the deadness of Sarah's womb, He staggered not at the promise of God through unbelief, but was strong giving glory to God. And being fully persuaded that, what He had promised, He was able... to do. And now I want to take the text for a few minutes, of speaking on this, "Faith In Action."

L-25 Now, faith is not based upon the shifting sands of man's ideas. You just couldn't... If I come here and told you there was an Angel of the Lord that was in the building, and--and these things happening, if I didn't have something to prove that to you, you'd have a right to doubt it. If I said God gave a gift to do a certain thing and you seen it come right back around and fail, fail, fail, you'd say, that's wrong. But when it comes back and God proves it every time to be perfect, then that's right; God has proved it. So that's the way we have to... Faith has to have a resting place.

L-26 Faith... If you were going to--to get married, some of you young men... If you were going to get married, the woman that you'd marry, you'd have to have faith in her; she'd have to have faith in you, 'cause it can't be based upon anything else, it's--you've got to have faith in what we're doing. And the only solid resting place for faith is on God's Word. God's Word is a solid Rock. Of any faith that anybody wants to have in the supernatural, it must be placed first in the Word of the living God. How, it's been through the age, how that when men of old in all ages, when they would really 55-1003, Faith In Action, Lane Tech High School, Chicago, IL, 79 min find the Word of God and could grasp It, faith went into action right away.

L-27 Look at Noah way back in Genesis. When God spoke to Noah that day, the Word of God came to Noah and told him to build an ark for the saving of his household. And you know, the world stood upright before the antediluvian destruction; it wasn't leaning back like this to bring water. And when God told Noah He was going to send a flood, a rain, why, you know he had critics. But faith doesn't look at what circumstances is; faith looks to what God says. Faith don't try to reason. Faith just takes it at it's face value. Now, there's two different kinds of what we call faith today. And I'm sorry to say this to my audience tonight, but I'm too sure of this--or real sure of this, that's there's too much intellectual faith in the stead of being heart faith.

L-28 See, so many a revivals are going across the country and people are claiming to be saved, and great evangelists saying they had so many thousands saved and so forth. I believe it's been... And then you go back and find out those people don't stay. They just... just an emotion in the meeting, and their worked away. Many people in the meeting raise up and claim healing and walk away, more by emotion or more by--more by psychic than they do by real Divine revelation of--of the Lord Jesus. And the first little pain strikes them, they give up and say, "Well, I didn't get my healing." Now, if you really believe that with your heart, ten thousand pains would never make you give it up. That's right, 'cause you, your faith is already went to motion. You--you, you're in action right then.

L-29 Now, when--when God spoke to Noah and told him the impossible... Now, there was no rain, never had rained, and never was a cloud in the sky or anything else; but Noah knew that it was going to rain because God said so. Now, he was considered fanatic. He was considered a little crazy, I suppose, in his day, a real fanatic. And most always, when you find people that'll dare to take God at His Word, they're considered neurotics or fanatics. That's right. The real true believer has never had the world to pat him on the back; it's always against him, because he takes God at His Word. And God has never been a friend to the world in the way of the world a being a friend of God, I mean. they're against God because they can't understand God. And you'll never know God only by faith.

L-30 But Noah, he moved with fear, knowing that there was coming a destruction; and he built an ark because he had his faith rested upon God's eternal Word. No matter how much the people said it can't be done, no matter how much science combed the globe and said there'll never be clouds up there, there's no rain to come down; if God's Word said that it's going rain, it's up to God to make a way for the rain. If God said so, that settles it. That's what we ought a do. That's what this--this little group in here ought to do tonight. Take God just for what He says, Don't make no difference how it looks; don't reason it. If you've only got intellectual faith, you'll reason God's Word; you'll try to reason It, say, "Now, let me see. Now, the doctor said I can't get well, and if the doctor said so, that ought to settle it." That's reason. Faith don't reason; faith believes it anyhow.

L-31 Look how many's been here--how many I guess right in here know that the doctor's has give up. Look at the great clinics, John Hopkins, Mayo Brothers, and through my own humble ministry, I've seen Almighty God turn those people to naught and heal the sick that they said it was impossible for them to get well. And the magazines and so forth packed the articles of it. See, it's the people's faith. Them men... I have nothing against the clinics, now, understand, or the doctor's; they're all right. But they're men; their knowledge is limited; but God's unlimited. And when God says anything, it's just that way. It just has to be.

L-32 And you watch, science will try to prove God to be a liar. Here sometime ago, they said God sure made a mistake, when he said that he made the firmament before there was a sun to make the light, that He made a mistake. But you know what, they got fumbling around in God's laboratory and found out that God was right, yeah. They got an X-ray now that'll take your picture without any light. So the Bible said your--your body is full of light. And we come to find out the old scientist said that was a crazy, there was no light in your body, but the Bible said your whole body's full of light. And we find out today that your body is made up of light meters. X-ray proves it; it takes your own light from your body to take the picture on the inside of you, so God's right after all.

L-33 Here some time ago, they said that a--a the Bible was wrong when it said man thinketh with his heart, said there's no mental faculty's in the heart to think with. But they come to find out that God was right. Way down in the human heart, there's a little compartment, a little cell, a little place smaller than a cell, that even blood don't even dwell in. It's 55-1003, Faith In Action, Lane Tech High School, Chicago, IL, 79 min not in the animal heart; it's only in the human heart; and they say it's the occupation of the soul. So after all God lives in the heart, and man thinketh from his heart, not from his mind. He reasons here, but he believes from here.

L-34 So if you just only got a mental conception of the Bible, if you say, "Well, I--I believe it because I read it. God's got to reveal it to you by your heart. No man can call Jesus the Christ, only by the Holy Spirit. The Holy Spirit deals in the heart. So if a man really believes it from his heart, he's not afraid to put it to a test. But if you're just mentally, you'll reason it out, say, "Well, I couldn't do that. They might do it; this one might've done it. she might a got well, but I don't know about myself." But if you've really based your faith on God's eternal Word and it's down in your heart, all devils out of torment can't upset you. No, sir, you've got to stay there.

L-35 I know what I speak of, because I've seen it, and I've put it to the test myself, and I know that it's true. Why would I stand here on the platform at night and challenge an audience of many thousands. Stood in Bombay, India, five hundred thousand people and challenged them, seventeen different religions to come to the platform and show me one visible sign of a supernatural being. And stood right in the midst of atheist and unbelievers and witch doctors and everything else, standing out there by the dozens, trying to throw a spell on me. And challenged a blind man, (Hallelujah), and God gave his sight right there and turned the whole thing around. Why, God said He'd do it; that's all. Only thing you do... God said so. That's good enough for me, if He told me He'd be with me and help me in these things, He will do it. Amen. He has done it, eight years, nine years has passed in the ministry and He's still doing it and He will continue to do it because He's God and He cannot lie. God's Word is right every time. If you'll only look and see what the Word says...

L-36 What if Pharaoh would've looked into the Word of God? He would've changed his attitudes toward Moses and the rest of--of the Israelites. If he'd have looked in and see where God promised by His Word He was going to bring the children out of Egypt, he would've done it; he would've changed his attitude towards the people. But he--he was all so busy; he went to church, sure, a very religious man. And he went to church, and he was a, what you call, a mental believer, a psychic believer, or whatever you want to call it. He had a knowledge of what he was doing in the mental way. But to have a real revelation that God was going keep that Word, if he'd have had that, he wouldn't have acted toward Moses the way he did.

L-37 But Moses with his foot on the throne, a son of Pharaoh, was to become the ruler, and he would be the chief captain over the biggest military nation in the world, that had the world at their feet. Egypt was the--was the commercial nation of all the world at that time. And Moses with his foot on the throne, a young man, forty years old, and could've went right on into, but he chose rather, because why, he looked at the Word of God and he seen God made the promise.

L-38 And Moses' faith did not rest upon what he could do with the biggest army in the world. It didn't rest on what he could do setting on Pharaoh's throne as a Pharaoh. His faith rested upon what THUS SAITH THE LORD said. What did he have to do? If he'd have chose to set on Pharaoh's throne, there'd have been little maidens come by and given him wine and everything, and they'd have brought him food and everything.

L-39 But he looked out into that desert. Would take a two million Jews with much--not much more than heathens, to take them out there in the desert where there wasn't even a--a growing thing. He had to feed them in the journey for forty years. He had deserts and disappointments and everything ahead of him. But God's Word give the promise he'd take them to the promised land, and Moses took out after God's Word.

L-40 Why? If Moses would've took the--Pharaoh's throne, he'd have been known as another Pharaoh. He'd be gone and in torment today. But he's immortal among men today because he chose rather, and put his faith into action. "How you going to do it Moses? What can you do? How can you a--a one man lead a two million people to a promised land?" "God said so." And he was a vindicated by an Angel who come down and talked to him and told him that he was born for this purpose. And Moses knew what he was talking about. So he didn't stand back and baby around with it; he put his faith into action. 55-1003, Faith In Action, Lane Tech High School, Chicago, IL, 79 min

L-41 That's what it takes. No matter how much faith you've got, if you won't use it, it's no good to you. That's right. What good is a God of Moses, if He ain't the same God today? What good is a historical God? You people who go to church, and your church only teaches that some historical fact about the Holy Ghost coming back on the day of Pentecost, there is no such a thing today, there was healing back there that... What good does that do you? Just no more than reading George Washington once lived. That's right. Abraham Lincoln once lived according to the history. Abraham Lincoln lived, according to the history. George Washington lived. But they're dead and buried, according to the history. But look, Jesus Christ lives; He died; He rose again, according to the Scriptures is alive forevermore. That's what Washington done. You'll believe Washington and doubt Christ. Hallelujah.

L-42 What we need today is some real genuine faith put into action. Yes, sir. We need real faith and men who dare to put God's Words to their heart and apply it to themselves. You try to apply it to the generation gone by, but the Bible says that Jesus Christ is the same yesterday today and forever. He's forever God. He never fails. He's the same in principle; He's the same in power. He's the same tonight that he was when he walked on the banks of Galilee, and appears nightly on this platform and proves Hisself alive from the dead. Amen. You don't have to take any history about it; it's a right now present time fact that we see it. Amen.

L-43 A few days ago when a woman rose from a wheelchair, two blind women received their sight. The power of God come down revealing things and secrets of the hearts, calling to the meetings and things like that, which is infallible proof that Jesus raised from the dead. Oh, my, that takes the wishbone out and puts a backbone in your back. When you come to find out that Jesus... Really we got a fact that He raised from the dead and is here tonight proving Hisself alive. Action, your faith put in action. What good's it going to do you to read of a historical God if He isn't the same God today? What good's it going to do to read about old George Washington if he's dead and gone? It's just a history fact. But Jesus raised from the dead, and He's the same today.

L-44 What good does it do to--to paint fire to a freezing man? Show him a picture of a nice big warm fire and the man's a freezing; that's something that was. That's what people are trying to keep you alive by today. No wonder we got a failure in America of--of religion. No wonder the magazine says the spiritual on-go is a burst. Is because that they failed to represent the right thing to them. They're trying to teach them of a historical God. But what we need today is a God resurrected from the dead and on hand right now to do whatever He promised He would do to confirm His Word. And we need delegates out there in the audience who's willing to rest their soul on any Word that God said and put it to action. Amen. That's what we need today. That's what we need is men and women who stand up to the forefront there and call the devil a liar, and say, "Jesus Christ stripped you and robbed you of every right you had, and I'm in Christ Jesus, and the world belongs to me." Amen. Right.

L-45 What good does it do to have a bird to have wings as long as you've got him in a cage? He can't fly, he don't need no wings. If you got him in a cage. Oh you... That's the way a lot of these people are. They're in a cage, taught the days of miracles is past, "Oh, there's a God, oh, yes we believe that Jesus was His Son; I've accepted Him as personal Saviour. But I tell you all those things is back there in the old days, they're past. The days of miracles is past." What good's your wings going to do you? What good's your faith going to do you, if you can't turn it loose? What good's your faith going to do if you can't put it in action? Certainly, if I believe Jesus lives today, I'll put it in action. Amen.

L-46 He lives today; He's the same Jesus; certainly He is. If the blind Bartimaeus could trust Him, I can to. If the woman with the blood issue could touch His garment, I can to. For He's open and willing; He's begging and accepting. "Whosoever will, let him come and drink from the Waters of Life freely." What we need today's a revival of that type. Oh, you might take your bird and feed him very good orthodox food, oh, yes. You might give him fish bone birdseed and everything else, but what good is it going to do him? What does fish bone do, what does birdseed do, develop wings. What good's his wings, if you got him in a cage? That's the way it is today. You--you might send your seminary boys in there, and teach them all kind of theology, and 55-1003, Faith In Action, Lane Tech High School, Chicago, IL, 79 min all about this, that, or the other, but if you're afraid to turn your faith loose to trust God, what good does it do to teach them. Amen. What we need's to turn loose. Let your faith go in action.

L-47 I like David. He knowed that the--Samuel the prophet had poured the oil on his head. Come up there to the army that day, and there stood old, big old Goliath over there making his boasts, and the armies of God all backed up with their theology. That they were Israelites and circumcised and so forth, but a-scared. Oh, that reminds me of the church today: scared to make a move. He come out and made a boast, but the wrong man heard it ('fore them). A little old scrawny runty looking boy about like that with a little piece of sheepskin wrapped around him, said, "You mean to tell me, you cowards will stand here and let that uncircumcised Philistine defy the armies of the living God?" He was ready to put what he had to action. Hallelujah.

L-48 That's what we need tonight is to get somebody who will take what you got and put it to action. Let your faith go. Why, he said, told Saul, said, "Your servant was herding his Father's sheep, and a lion come up to get a--a lamb, and I took the slingshot and knocked him down; he rose up against me; I took my knife and killed him." He said, "A bear went after another one, and I took it out of his mouth." He said, "God helped me to do that, how much more will He, that uncircumcised Philistine who's defying the armies of the living God." Amen, I like that. Yes, sir.

L-49 Now, Saul wanted to send him to a seminary, you know, and get him fixed up. He went and took his great big armor and put on him, it made him bowlegged. That's what's the matter today, we got so many theologies and different degrees, and doctor's, and everything, until it's... Why, you know Saul found out that his ecclesiastical vest didn't fit a man of God. He said, "Throw this thing off a me. I ain't got no use for it. It don't fit me."

L-50 Now, I don't see where any great big names and so forth fits a real man of God. The Holy Ghost saved me; the Holy Ghost give me this; the Holy Ghost is good enough for me to trust. I know if I just put Him to action, it's His Word, God will bring it to pass. Certainly, if you only knew what you know and put your faith to work, God will do the same thing for you. The God of Moses is not dead. the God of David's not dead. This God's still alive.

L-51 Jesus come; He knew Who He was. When He went down there to the grave of Lazarus after the Father had showed Him a vision. Told Him go leave the house of Lazarus, was gone for four days, they sent for Him, He didn't go back. He knew what was going to happen after the time fulfilled the vision. He said, "Our friend Lazarus sleepeth; I go wake him." When he gets to the grave, He said, "I thank You Father that You've already heard Me." Sure he was crying when He went to the grave, He was sympathy with the people. But when He got to the grave there, there wasn't a doubt in His mind. Said, "Father, I thank Thee because You've already heard Me. But for these that's standing by, I said. Said, 'Lazarus come forth.'" And a man that had been dead four days, come out of the grave. Why, He knew where He was standing; He knew that He was the anointed Christ. He knew He had God's Word. He knew that what God showed Him was the truth.

L-52 And that same Word... And He promised it to you. Whatsoever you ask in my Name, that I'll do." That's right. He defeated the devil on the Word of God. The devil come to Him and said, "Now, you do a miracle before me; I hear you're going to be a miracle worker. You do something before me." That devil still lives. "Turn these stones into bread and eat, and I'll believe you." Jesus said, "It is written, man shall not live by bread alone, but by every Word that proceedeth out of the mouth of God."

L-53 There's where his faith was anchored. There's where every man and woman faith to be anchored tonight is upon the living Word of God. You believe that, you can put it in action. Jesus when he was here on earth. He said, "Verily, verily I say unto you, I can do nothing in myself; I'm the Son, I can do nothing; but what the Father shows Me, that I do. I come to do the will of God." And when He went away he said this ministry shall not cease now. "For the very things that I do, you will do also. For I will be with you, even in you to the end of the world." And this will be a sign," Hallelujah. "The very things that I do, shall you do till the end of the 55-1003, Faith In Action, Lane Tech High School, Chicago, IL, 79 min world."

L-54 He that... "There--there'll be people that will not see Me no more, but you shall see Me. For I'll be with you even in you to the end of the time." Jesus Christ is raised from the dead tonight. His supernatural powers is still with us. His great signs and wonders are taking place. Things that's never took place since the Apostle's days are taking place tonight; I say it humbly. But here's a direct evidence of scientific that Jesus Christ raised from the dead.

L-55 The same Pillar of Fire that led the children of Israel through the wilderness, the same Angel of God that come into the--the place and delivered Peter from the bars, the same Lord Jesus that stood before Paul and sent the shining light that blinded his eyes. And the men around him couldn't see no light at all. But Paul; it put his eyes out. And he was blind and had to be led by the hands to the city, the light was so bright around him. That same Light, the Lord Jesus Christ is here tonight in His resurrected Being and proving Himself by infallible signs and wonders that He's here. Oh, people, put your faith into action. Don't be a scared. Why, shame on you; don't be scared. Stand fast in the liberty wherein Christ has made you free. Don't entangle yourself in a bird cage any longer. Come on out of it. Break down the walls. Christ tore down the middle walls of partition, made us free. We're ready to fly away. Amen. I like that.

L-56 I've often said one time, watching an eagle... And after I leave this meeting, it comes my vacation, going to the mountains. How I love to get away to myself, way up into the mountains, and watch nature. God is in nature. One day while watching a big eagle there, when I wondered what he was doing; he was looking at me, and a little squirrel was barking at him. I thought, "God, why'd You bring that before me for?" And after while that big fellow... I said... I grabbed my rifle; I said, "I could shoot you." And he wasn't worried about that. I kept noticing him fooling with his feathers in his wings like that. I thought, "That's it; he trusts in his wings. God give him two wings and he's a free bird. He can escape from danger any time he wants to." Hallelujah. That's it. If--if a eagle can have confidence in the wings that God give him, how much more ought you to have confidence in the Holy Ghost that saved your soul and baptized you with His soul.

L-57 Then, he didn't push and jump and squabble. He just made one big leap and jumped out, set his wings, and flopped a couple times, and got above the timberline, and just set his wings. What did he do? He put his faith in his wings into action. Here come a big puff of wind; he never flopped in the wind; he just rode the wind and went higher. Another wind come; he rose higher. He rose higher, higher until I couldn't see him no more. I stood there and cried like a baby.

L-58 Why? It doesn't mean, run over to this meeting, run over here and join this, and join that, and take your letter to the Methodist, the Baptist, the Assemblies, the Oneness, and so forth. That isn't it; it's set your faith to action in God's Word, and ride away on every wind of a Holy Spirit that breathes down upon a mortal human being. That's when he must set his faith in God and say God's Word is right. Here's my wings (Hallelujah), both the both New and Old Testament. I believe every Word of It will pack me. It brought me from a sinner to a Christian. It brought me from a cursing sinner to a preacher. It took me from a blind man to a good eye. It healed me when I was sick. It'll carry me from earth to glory some of these days. But my faith rests alone in Christ the Lord. Oh, my, [Blank.spot.on.tape--Ed.]... faith in action.

L-59 The heroes of the Old Testament had faith; they put it in action. You've got them for an example. Now we've got faith, but you won't put it in action. Ride away on the powers of the Holy Spirit. Shall we pray. Heavenly Father, in the Name of Thy beloved Son, the Lord Jesus, may the Holy Ghost encamp about every believer in here tonight. And may the Spirit of the living God move into here and carry every one of the away from the sick beds and sick and afflictions into the land of good health. May they walk out of here under the power of the Holy Ghost, knowing Jesus raised from the dead and is alive, surely, among us tonight. We ask in Jesus' Name, Amen.

L-60 All right, we have some prayer cards out. I feel real religious right now. I feel good. Action, let your faith go to work. What did God give it to you for? I believe they said they give a hundred prayer cards last night, and we called, maybe half of them or something. Let's begin... Let's begin about 50. Let's begin at 51, say, odd number. Who has prayer card 51, raise up your hand right quick. In your... Look at your prayer card. Just raise your hand. Don't... If I--I know who you are... All right, come here, 55-1003, Faith In Action, Lane Tech High School, Chicago, IL, 79 min lady. 52, will you bring your prayer... All right, a colored lady, all right. 53, would you bring your prayer or raise your hand? I... Maybe I can... 53. 54, 54, would you raise your hand right away? All right, 55, 55, would you raise your hand right away. All right, 56, line up over here. 57, 58, 59, 60. Let's see if we can get them up there, 60... see where they're coming. 61, 2, 3, 4, 5, see if we can get a line.

L-61 It don't make any difference who you are, where you at so we get lined up here and start praying. Oh, I love Him. When I think of His omnipotent message it raises my faith. Oh, Saviour, raise my faith in this till He can move a mountain. Lord, I believe; all my doubts are buried in the fountain. Jesus Christ the resurrected Son of God is here by scientific proof. Over and over again has the Lord proved it. Over and over again does the blind see, the deaf hear. Over, every night the impossibles, scientifically impossible for a human being to do what the Holy Spirit does here every night right before your face. Amen. Absolutely impossible, but Jesus Christ the resurrected Son of God does it anyhow. Isn't He wonderful. Let's move our faith.

L-62 How many tonight say, "Brother Branham..." Oh, I know there's not half a building full here hardly, but how many would say, "Brother Branham, tonight I'm setting my sails. I'm placing everything that I've got, my faith in Jesus Christ. I'm setting right up. I'm believing You."? God bless you. Oh, my, let's stop this wishing and go to really action with God. Let's go and mean business with Him. How can you doubt any longer? How can you when the Holy Spirit by the scientific world over and over again proving His Presence, showing that He's here, showing by infallible signs in the scientific world, come right down at the meeting and do the very same things that Jesus of Nazareth did when He was here on earth, proven by the infallible sign that He's alive today and living among you. Oh, it ought to bring your faith right up a place to say, "God be praised. I believe You, Lord. I have need for this or that, and tonight I stand solemnly on Your Word and walk away from here a well person, or a Christian, or whatever you have need of." Amen. Oh, my,

L-63 What a wonderful change in my life has been wrought, Since Jesus came into my heart." How my eyes was once blind... Amazing Grace! How sweet the sound That saved a wretch like me. I once was lost but now I'm found, I was blind but now I see. Through many dangers toils and snares... (the devil trying to say, "Oh, this is not... This is something else. This...) Through many dangers toils and snares I have already come, It's grace that's brought be safe this far, It's grace that'll take me on. (Hallelujah.) We've been there ten thousand years, Bright shining as the sun, We'll have no less days to sing His praise, Than when we've first begun."

L-64 When that great redeemed host stands around the throne of God waving the white palms of the--the palms in their hands and the white robes washed in the Blood of the Lamb, "We'll tell the story how we've overcome..." How did we overcome? By the Blood of the Lamb and their testimony. Hallelujah. What is their testimony? Jesus lives. Oh, let it ring out through the mountains to the hills, send the message far and wide, Jesus lives. He's not dead but He's alive. I'm so happy to stand here in the--one of the major cities of the world, Chicago, Illinois, and claim that Jesus Christ raised from the dead, and by His grace can prove it to you. Amen. Then let your sin cease. Take the idols from your hearts, and believe on the living God, and accept the blessings that He died for and appropriated for you. Put your faith into action.

L-65 Here sets a woman on the platform. God of heaven knows this is the first time I ever laid my eyes on her. Now, 55-1003, Faith In Action, Lane Tech High School, Chicago, IL, 79 min maybe... I don't know how many hundreds of people's setting in here. Wouldn't make any difference if the whole world was setting here: doesn't matter. The woman's here for something, I don't know. "Well, Brother Branham, you mean to say that woman..." Yes, sir, that's right. "And what if she's sick, can you heal her?" No, sir, there's no one else can do it. If I can make her believe that Jesus did it when He died at Calvary, she's ready to accept it, it's over. Right. That'll be her faith; Jesus said, "As thou hast believed, so be it to you."

L-66 There's a woman I never seen her; she never seen me. That's right I guess, lady; we're strangers to each other, are we? We are. Kinda godly looking woman and motherly type of woman, and there she is, and here I am; a years younger than her, probably born many miles apart, and the first time meeting in life. What's she here for? You want to take my place? Certainly... Let me tell you, I would do it either unless the Holy Spirit said, "I'll be with you." Amen. The Angel of God said, "I'll be with you," therefore, I'm not scared. Amen. Why? I'm trusting what He said. "Why, would you trust in an Angel?" As long as He spoke according to the Word. "Well, how is that according to the Word?" Jesus met a woman like that one day He'd never seen in His life. He talked to her a few minutes and told her exactly where her trouble was. Is that right? And Jesus said, when He was risen, said, "A little while and the... These things that I do you shall do also, even more than this, 'cause I'm going to the Father. A little while and the world will see Me no more, yet you shall see Me. I will be with you; I'll be in you to the end of the world." Jesus made those statements, and He's true, I know His Word is true. That's right. And His promise to me is true, and His promise to you is true. Amen.

L-67 Just talk about a miracle... Said, "The days of miracles is past." What would make that woman--me know what that woman, what any of you out there, what it would be? I couldn't do it. You might say, "Well, now... (she'd come up here), what if He didn't tell you?" Well, then I wouldn't know. That's right. But if He does tell me I will know. If that ain't a miracle I never told it. If there... That's the same kind of thing that the Bible called a miracle. And it is a miracle; it's in the line of supernatural. If I told you I done it myself, I'd be a liar. But I'm telling you Jesus Christ raised from the dead. He's here tonight. He's still the Lord Jesus. You believe.

L-68 I'm going to ask you to be reverent, be quiet, not stir around. I don't care for your praising God, of course... you can. That's been one thing that's worried me; why is it people in America, they can see the Lord working and set dead still and never move and set like they was a bump on a pickle. I--I can't understand that, looks to me like... It thrills my soul till I... Oh, it looks to me like I could scream to the top of my voice, "Jesus lives." Why, I'm a mortal; I'm here in the world. What am I? Where'd I come from? Where am I going? And Jesus come and said, "I'll be your Compass; I'll be your Guide." He's raised from the dead, don't worry. "When old age...?... don't worry about that. When sickness strikes, don't worry, I'm here. Be not dismayed; neither be thou afraid, for the Lord Thy God is with thee wheresoever thou goest." Amen.

L-69 All right, sister, would you come up this way just a moment if you will. I want to challenge this audience. I spoke of Jesus. Jesus is the One I love. Jesus is the One I believe. And Jesus is the One Who promised these things. And if Jesus promised them, Jesus will do them, won't He? How many out there doesn't have any prayer cards now, and wants to be healed by the Lord, would you raise your hand? Now, looky here. Let me ask you something. I challenge your faith. I challenge you to put your faith to action. Look this way, say, "God, I believe the man's told the truth. And if You'll turn around and tell me, let him, like Jesus did told the woman. I'm going to believe that You healed me, and if You'll let him turn around and tell me the same thing, I'll accept it; I'll believe it with all my heart. If He'd tell one out there that, it ought to make every one of you believe it. Sure.

L-70 If Jesus... Here this poor little woman standing here, I don't know what she's here for. God knows that, but if Jesus Christ... If someone... If something would take place here and tell her what she's here for, well, that would be a miracle, wouldn't it? And now, as far as healing here, if she's sick, I don't know. But it ought to make every one of you believe, 55-1003, Faith In Action, Lane Tech High School, Chicago, IL, 79 min make every one of you know that that same Angel that's on this pictures here, is down there, It's promised in the Bible it come through the Bible age it's still living here tonight. The very same Angels that they had was... What... A "Angel" is "a messenger" and anyone knows that the Pillar of Fire that led the children of Israel was the Angel of the Covenant, is that right, ministers? Well, Who was it? Jesus Christ, the same yesterday, today, and forever.

L-71 It's Jesus Christ, that--that same Light appeared to Peter and delivered him out of the prison. The same Light appeared to Paul smote him blind, took him down... You said, "Did He smite him blind?" Yes, sir, the Bible said It did. And that's the same thing It'll do to people. Today, if you won't accept Light, the Light will put your eyes out, and you'll walk in darkness. You'll either receive it or reject it, is that right? So believe with all your heart. I'm waiting for His Presence, of course I am. And I--and I know He's here at the platform. But I--I'm looking for His anointing. Now, you believe with all your heart. And God be merciful and go get the sick and bring them in.

L-72 And now, sister, I want to talk to you just a moment. Just as... we're standing here different ages... that light's right in your face, I know, like that, but we, you and I, being strangers to each other, and not knowing one another, there would have to be a some way that I would be told or know, or something would have to take place if I know what you was here for. Is that right? Yes. No, I don't want you... No, I say, if I told you, if you told me, See, if you told me, then sure I'd know if you told me. But if you don't tell me, then something has to tell me, doesn't it? Well, then if the Lord Jesus... Is this one of your first times in the meeting? Oh, it's your first time. I see. All right. Well, then in the meeting, back when Jesus was here on the earth, He went around to the people and He'd go to the places, and... He didn't heal people; He said He didn't; He said that, "I can do nothing in Myself; but what I see the Father doing, that I do." See? He said, "It's not Me that doeth the works; it's My Father." And in the Bible when He'd stand... And in the Bible time He would look out to His audience and say to the people this one or certain, "Your faith has healed you from certain thing."

L-73 And one day He was talking to a woman at the well. And--and he... (You probably heard the story in the Bible?) Yes, yes, and then you--read the story... Well then, you find out that He sent His disciples away, 'cause His Father told Him to go up there. The woman come and was talking. And He got to talking to her. And when He got to talking to her, He said, "Bring Me a drink." And she said, "Oh, it's not customary for you Jews to ask Samaritans such." He said, "But if you knew Who you were talking to, you'd ask Me for a drink." And went ahead with the conversation, finally He found right where her trouble was. And she wasn't living right. So He said, "Go, get your husband." She said, "I don't have any husband." Said, "That's right, you got five." Now, watch what she said. She said, "Sir, I perceive that You are a Prophet. Now, I know when Messiah cometh..." That Messiah was Jesus. Said, "I know when He comes, He will tell us these things." But she didn't know Who He was. He said, "I am He, the Messiah." And she run into the city telling people. Now, Jesus said, "After I'm gone a little... The world won't believe Me any more, so they won't see it." But said, "You shall see me, for I'll resurrect from the dead, come back and live in you, through every age to the end of the world."

L-74 Now, if that Bible is true, Jesus is obligated to His Word, isn't He? Now, if Jesus stands here tonight and me--you and I are strangers, and tell me something about you that you know that I do not know... And you hear, probably heard other people say how they were getting well of different diseases, and blind, afflicted; you know it's Jesus a doing that, 'cause man can't do it. Now, if God will help me tonight, if I believe that He will, to help you, there's... The anointing doesn't strike me just right; I don't know why. But if He will, then you will believe and accept that whatever you're here for... I don't know what it is, might be finances, it might be domestic, might be sickness, I don't know. But if He will tell me, then you'll believe the same Jesus that raised from the dead is here tonight talking, is that right? All right, will you believe it, audience? Every one of you believe with all your heart. 55-1003, Faith In Action, Lane Tech High School, Chicago, IL, 79 min

L-75 Now, I... It's... You see what a--a place it's in. Now, it's got to be God or the woman will have to walk off here without anything. See? Now, if she's sick, and I could heal her and wouldn't do it, I'd be a brute. I can't heal the woman, but by a Divine gift by Jesus Christ... If He were standing here Himself with this suit on, He couldn't heal her. He'd tell her that He already did it when He died. Did Jesus die to heal us? to save us? Then that's complete. See? We just confess our sins, and then He is just to forgive, because He's already done it. We accept what He done.

L-76 Now, the little lady before me... May the Holy Spirit... He's here. And now, may His blessings rest upon you each, every one of you. Be real reverent. Now, I just want to talk to the lady a minute. All right, sister... Now I trust that the Holy Ghost tonight, which is standing near... And right now I want to ask you something. Just the last moment or so, there's been a strange feeling come into you, hasn't there, kind of an odd like a sweet calm feeling, like something was fixing to take place? Because that's the Holy Spirit that standing between us (See?) a Light. And now, you're here, and I see what's wrong with you. You are suffering from a heart trouble. You have heart trouble. Yes, sir, yes, sir. And then you have a--you have someone you're concerned about, a loved one; it's a boy. And that boy is--has a mental condition. That's right, isn't it? Now, I want to tell you where my stumble is to you. I seen here not long ago you in a Catholic church or something or other, saying a prayer, but you have just been recently converted and become a Protestant, just recently, is that right? All right, now, do you believe me as God's prophet? All right, go and receive your healing in--in the Name of the Lord Jesus Christ.

L-77 Have faith in God. Only Believe. Let your faith rise up and believe with all your heart, and Jesus Christ make you well. Watch the difference in the walking of the lady at this time. Let's say, "Praise the Lord," all of us, will you? Sure, God wants to be worshipped. Now, He's here. What did that? Right now, I couldn't no more tell you what was said to that woman than nothing. What did it? I never did it. Here's the One that did it, right here, and that's the One that's right here now. God knows that. All right. All right, everyone be reverent now. Here's--here's another typical case. A--a lady, colored woman standing here, me a white man, and that is an Ethiopian, not Ethiopian, I beg... or Samaritan woman that met Jesus that discussed about the racial affair. See, they had it in that day, but Jesus let her know there's no difference; we're all the same. Jesus died for every one of us.

L-78 Now, we're strangers to one another. We are of two different races. See? And we... Our forefathers was raised in different countries. It turned some of white, and some yellow, and some brown and some black, that... We all come from Adam. That's all. And Jesus Christ died for every one of us to make us all one in Him. You believe that, don't you? You do. And now, you being a colored woman, me a white man, and--and born, maybe, miles apart, and never met each other till just now... Is that... You have met me before. [Sister talks to Brother Branham--Ed.] Did you hear that? Two year... Where was that at, sister? [Sister says, "Right here."] Right here, two years ago a cancer was eating her up. And I prayed for her here on the platform, and God healed her sound and well of it. Let us say, "Praise the Lord."

L-79 Is Jesus alive? Sure, He is. Now, probably if she hadn't have told me that, I'd have knew that in a few minutes when the vision come. See, but if it would strike now, 'course I might say it over; I don't know. I'm in another world, and I just have to say what I'm looking at. See? I can't say. I pray that God will give me something different from that, so that it might help the faith... She don't need that. She wouldn't have say nothing. She just wants to be prayed for, or either she's got something on her heart. I don't know. May the Lord reveal it to me now. All right. I know you believe me then, sister. You're bound to believe. The Bible said one time, said, "Jesus was the devil," some of the Pharisees. Another one said, "Can the devil open the eyes of the blind?" No, sir, no, the devil can't heal at all. He has no virtue of healing at all. Only God, healing... "I'm the Lord Who heals all your diseases," He said. That's right. Yes.

L-80 But you're suffering with something else, sister. That's right. I see you... You got a--you got heart trouble for one thing. Your suffering with a heart fluttering like around your heart. That is true. And I see something another, you--you 55-1003, Faith In Action, Lane Tech High School, Chicago, IL, 79 min got something like headaches or something; it's sinus, sinus trouble. Isn't that right? That's the truth, isn't it? Now, see, Jesus still lives, doesn't He? Uh-huh. Now, the woman... I don't know how many I can get in the prayer line, but just watch the Holy Spirit now. If I was to talk to her now just a few minutes, maybe He'd say something else. He's told her something, ever what it was, it was true, just as it breaks... I see you somewhere. I forget where it was at now, but I seen you. Now, you just believe, 'cause you have good faith. You're... No doubt but what you--you'll get what you asked for. But I--I really believe that what you asked for, you already got it. So I--I just want to talk to you though, so the audience would know and other--other colored people in here that know you, and so forth, would know.

L-81 Now, maybe He'd tell you something that's going to happen in a few days or something like that, or something that--that happened way yonder long ago, just something that you know I don't know nothing about, just encourage the other people. I hope that He will. I can only ask. And this is a Divine gift. Later this week I'll explain the best I can, how it comes. Something strange... I see the woman leading a little boy. It's a little boy about--about eight years old. And the little boy is--he's been to a doctor; he's bothered with constipation, and it causes his little bowels to bleed. And the doctor can't check it. That's true. I go to... Put that handkerchief you got in your hand on him, he will get well. God bless you.

L-82 Hallelujah. Praise be to the living God, Who knows all things, knows the secrets of your heart. The Angel that appeared to me said you'll know the very secrets of things that's in their heart. Isn't that the very same thing that Jesus did when He was here on earth? Then why wouldn't He do the same, if He is the same? He's bound to do the same. God only knows.

L-83 Now, here stands a lovely little lady before me. I've never seen her in my life. She's a total stranger to me. I don't know her, but God knows her. That is true. And God can help her. And the only way He can do now, He sent His Word. You believe that to be the truth, don't you? In His Word, He said He'd set in the church apostles, prophets, teachers, evangelists. You believe that, don't you? The apostle has his part to do; the prophet has his part to do. Gifts of healing, working of miracles, all these things, it all goes in God. And you're very much in need of that tonight, aren't you? 'Cause you're suffering with a lady's trouble, a female condition that's bothering you. It's got you scared and worried, and you don't know what it's all about. Say, by the way, you've been in the hospital too. That's right. And you're a real nervous type person. And I see that you got stomach trouble, and every time you eat, your stomach goes into a spasm...?... That is right. Now, go eat, believe God with all your heart. Come here, sister, that I might ask Him to bless you. Now, our heavenly Father, be merciful to this young person standing here, who's in need of Your blessings. And I bless her with the anointing of the Holy Ghost upon me. I lay hands upon her in Jesus Christ's Name and ask that she be made well. Amen. Blessings be on you, sister.

L-84 Blessed be the Lord Jesus Christ; blessed be Jehovah-jireh, Jehovah-rapha, Who raised up His Son Christ Jesus, and set Him on high, Who raised him from the dead. He lives tonight. As sure as God lives, Christ lives. And His Spirit is here; It's infallible. Put your faith to work tonight. Believe Him with all your heart. Now, that makes me real weak. Just as soon as I go to dropping I can feel myself moving away, getting dizzy like, 'cause I'm getting weaker all the time. Speaking...

L-85 If you just pass the people and pray for... Now, here's a vision coming right now. I see that Light hanging right over this person standing here. It's a woman setting right here at the end. She's studying about someone. It's about a sister, and the sister has cancer. If that's right, lady, stand up on your feet. Is that... Raise your hand up right there. That's right. All right, you're worried about your sister with cancer, aren't you. Go, give her the good news, Jesus has raised them from the dead...?... Amen, believe with all your heart. Amen.

L-86 Have faith in God. Believe Him with all your heart, with all your soul, with all your mind, with all your strength. Have faith in God. If thou canst believe, all things are possible. What did that? Brother Branham had nothing at all to do with it. What did it? The woman's faith in the resurrected Lord Jesus, that's all, the Spirit, the supernatural One that's here now, Who knows you. 55-1003, Faith In Action, Lane Tech High School, Chicago, IL, 79 min Just let your faith fly away with Him tonight. Just get into His arms and move away. Just leave this old quacking world behind. Cross the separation between faith and unbelief and move off in faith, so many million miles beyond this chattering of the world here, saying the days of miracles is past, and Jesus died and that settled it. He rose again. Amen. Two thousand years has passed and He's here yet tonight in Chicago. And when aeons of time, when...?... time shall be no more, when every star ceases to shine, when the moon melts and flies into space, and the world is no more, Jesus Christ will still be alive. "And because I live, ye can live also." And we'll be with Him when there's no more world, and no more moon, and no more stars. The Lovely One that's with us tonight, we'll be with Him forevermore, in His Presence in the Father's house. Hallelujah.

L-87 Sure, you say I'm excited. I'm not excited; I'm happy. I got something to be happy about. My faith is coming closer in God. I find out God's done so many things for me, He's vindicated a work around the world, around the world, through every critic. I'm beginning to believe that what I ask, He will do it. Amen. I--I--I've got faith in Him, and I want you to have faith in Him; I want you to believe it. Amen. God be praised and blessed forever. Hallelujah.

L-88 You believe, sister? Is this the patient? You--you believe, all right. If you believe, only God can make you well. I can't make you well. If you're sick, I don't know. But now look, if I stood here and talked to you a few minutes, God would let me know what the trouble is. But if I... I believe if I just lay hands on you, you'd believe you got healed anyhow. See? You'd do it, wouldn't you? Sure you would. But, God, just for the sake of the audience, so you see, I can't on these kind of meetings. I couldn't stop it now and start doing that, 'cause it wouldn't--wouldn't work. See? But the audience might know. Let's talk a moment. Now, we--we probably this is... Is this our first meeting time in life? First time you've ever met me? Yeah, You was here yesterday at the meeting. But that... Well, I've never met you personally to know anything about you. Just heard about me. All right, I just want to a you to look to me a few minutes and take every thought away from your mind, and just say, "God, I know that this great feeling that I have now doesn't come from that poor little man standing there. It's bound to come from You, because it's working on the soul." And you know that's true; it--it is. But it has to come from Him, and He alone. And now if you will believe with all your heart, and God will reveal something, that--that you know that I don't know nothing about, and if He will reveal it to you right now on the platform, you'll accept what you come for, is that right? Will the audience do the same thing? May He do it now.

L-89 This ought to settle it, if God will do it. I don't say He will, He might not; He's never failed me yet. But I believe He will, and if He doesn't, I'll say sister, "I don't know." And I... 'Cause I'm just a man. I have no way of knowing. But if He will tell me and anoint me, then I'll know. Now, may He grant it is my prayer. Now, you're--you're conscious, that something's beginning to move on you. That's this very Light you see here in the picture. That's right. That's what it is. Now, you are--you're suffering with something that's on your hand. And you got a crippled hand. And that hand was caused by, you cut it some time ago on something like a glass or something, and--and something taking place. I see a the woman as she holding it, it was wrapped up with something, and it's great streaks, it took blood poisoning in it. And the blood poison got real bad, and it begin to move it down, and it's draining. And you've been to doctors, and they can't do nothing about it. And you're a woman, you work. And you work in some sort of a office, kind of a, you're typing, and you're doing typewriter work, and that hand, and someone told you a long time ago about my meetings. And they told you about me. You come over to the meeting tonight immediately after work without having your supper. You got a prayer card, and you went out and eat your supper and then come back, so that you could come and was called in the line, THUS SAITH THE LORD. Amen. That is true. You believe now? Go, receive your healing now. God in the Name of the Lord Jesus, grant it.

L-90 Have faith in God; don't doubt. Give Him Praise. Jesus raised from the dead and is a living in this auditorium in Chicago tonight. He will do anything that you'll ask Him to do if you'll believe it. But He can't do it until you believe it. Do you believe? Blessed be the Name of the Lord. I love Him with all my heart. Isn't He wonderful? Oh, how--how I love Him. Doesn't something just make you feel real kind of good down in the inside of your heart, when you know you don't have to guess any more. All the guessing's 55-1003, Faith In Action, Lane Tech High School, Chicago, IL, 79 min gone. The Bible's true. Jesus raised from the dead; He's here now. That's Him right now. That's not me. Why, I can't do that. I don't know those things, and don't heal people. It's Jesus the Son of God. Have faith in Him.

L-91 What do you think, mother, setting there looking at me? You're suffering with a head trouble, aren't you? You believe Jesus would make you well, little elderly lady, sitting right here? Yes, that's right. You were setting there praying, wasn't you, mother? You've got--having trouble with your head. That's right. Now, you believe He's going to make you well? You do? Will you do me a favor? Now, being that Jesus has been so good to you, lay your hand over on that man there. He's suffering with heart trouble. He--he's been... Well, he's had heart trouble a long time. Is... That's right. Now, amen. Now, sir, you were setting there saying, "Well, Lord, why don't You pass... Don't pass me while you're talking to her." Is that right? raise your hand. That's right. Now, He isn't going to pass you; He's going to heal you if you'll just believe it. Will you believe it? Amen. May the Lord Jesus make you well. Hallelujah. Have faith in God. There He is just moving through the audience. Oh, my, I wish I could. Oh, how He loves to be worshipped. He loves you. Praise be His Name. You ought to believe right now, every one of you. Have faith and believe.

L-92 Here's a man standing before me. How do you do, sir? Are we strange to each other, sir? We don't know each other? Oh, you've been in a meeting, come to me. I don't know you, though to know... No. But a there's Somebody here Who--Who does know you. Isn't that right? And He knows all about you, and He can heal you, can't He? and make you well? Sure, He can. He's lovely, and that's what makes Him so good, is because He's God, and He loves everybody. Now, if Jesus will tell me what you're here for, will you believe me to be His prophet? And then if He will tell me, then I'll come... That's anointing of something on me, isn't it? Then if I lay hands on you according to the Bible, then you believe you'd get well? Now, you're suffering with you're feet, aren't you, sir? It's your legs also. Isn't that right? Now, if I'd lay hands on you, you think they would get well? Here's another thing. You have been all bothered about somebody, and that's a nephew, a man. And he's not here. He's in a big city, great big city that sets near a border; it's Detroit, Michigan. And right at this very night, he's in a hospital; he's under oxygen tent, and he's got heart trouble. Take... Send that handkerchief you got in your hand to him for his healing, and you go in God's strength...?... going...?... Believe now with all your heart; may the Lord Jesus make you well.

L-93 Hallelujah. You believe you were healed setting right there? I believe it with all my heart. Oh, isn't He wonderful? Be reverent. Now, don't get up and leave. Is it time? All right, we'll close then. See? All right. May the Lord bless you, each one. When you stir, (See?) I can't... it won't... God is reverend, He can't--He just can't move when people are irreverent; we can't do it. I've held you too long perhaps. Have faith now. See, I told you, set still. You see, if you--if you move around, it throws it off to me. See it's souls; I can't explain it. You're spirit, and when you move, that interrupts the--the--the Holy Spirit. You say, "What about that in the Bible?" Why sure, Jesus put the people out of the house to raise a dead girl. He--He took a man and led him outside the city, away from the people to get him alone.

L-94 What do you think about that, little lady, setting there on the end? You were right then praying, "God, don't... Let this be my night, is that right?" If that's what you was asking God, stand up on your feet. Now, you know what? That stomach trouble you had is healed. Now, you can go eat what you want to. God bless you. Amen. What do you think about that, dad, sitting right behind her, see it moved right back to you setting there, you got rheumatism. You believe Jesus is going to make you well? All right, stand up on your feet, stomp your feet up-and-down, and go home, saying, "Thanks be to God." He healed you. Hallelujah.

L-95 Lady, setting there with your hands folded, saying, "Lord, let this be my night." If you believe, you won't have heart trouble any more. Do you believe? Hallelujah. Then go and receive. Praise be to God. Have faith in God. Heart trouble's nothing for God to heal, is it, sister? He can just make it well; He can do anything He wants to, can't He? You believe He will do it? Little lady, setting right back here on the end of that row, first row over here, setting with gallbladder trouble, setting there praying, you believe God's going to make you well... On a little short row over there on the end, you believe 55-1003, Faith In Action, Lane Tech High School, Chicago, IL, 79 min Jesus Christ's going to make you well? If you can believe it, you can have what you ask for. God bless you, sister, you received your healing. Amen.

L-96 Let's say, "Praise the Lord." Do you believe it on one accord? Put your hands on one another and let's pray the prayer of faith right now and just everybody be healed at once. Almighty God, in the Name of Jesus Thy Son, let this be the hour that when the people will set their faith in God, and the great Holy Ghost will heal every one that's in here. Grant it, Lord. May their faith reach out now, take a hold of God, and be healed every one. Let the Holy Ghost fall right here in this building and make them every one well. I rebuke the devil; I condemn him. In Jesus Christ's Name I cast him out of every person in here. Amen. Courtesy of Living Word Broadcast P. O.
