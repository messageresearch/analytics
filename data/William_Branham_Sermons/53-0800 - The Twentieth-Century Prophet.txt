L-1 May I present my wife? Honey, this is Brother Leroy and Paul Kopp of Los Angeles, California. [Sister Branham says, "Delighted to have you in our home, Brother Kopp."--Ed.] [Brother Kopp says, "Brother Branham, in your two great campaigns at Los Angeles, at Calvary Temple, we noticed that the Lord Jesus Christ worked with you in a very special manner with these marvelous gifts: discerning of the spirits of men's hearts as well as the sicknesses of their body, and the signs of healing and miracles that were wrought. We thought it was wonderful--Ed.] [Brother Kopp says, "We're interested, Brother Branham, in hearing more about this unique ministry that God has given you."--Ed.]

L-2 Very well, Brother Kopp. Let's go back to the beginning. I was born in eastern Kentucky, in a little log cabin near Burkesville, Kentucky. The morning of my birth, I'm told of my parents, that there was a Light came into the room and hung over me. My people was not a religious people. They did not go to any church. Of course, this caused quite a stir among them. It's followed me all the days of my life. Recently, they took a picture of It in the scientific world as shown here. You're probably familiar with this picture. It was proven by science that it was the only supernatural Being that was ever scientifically photographed. To my opinion, It's the same Angel of God that followed the children of Israel from Egypt unto Palestine. You know as a scholar yourself, that was the Angel of the Covenant, none other than our Lord Jesus Christ. And when here on earth, manifested in flesh, He did not claim to be a great Person. He said, "The Son can do nothing, just as the Father shows him." He...

L-3 In Saint John the 5th chapter, perhaps you're acquainted with it, the Scripture, Jesus passed through this famous pool of Bethesda. He find many crippled people there, blind, halt, lame, waiting for the moving of the water. It was strange that He just ministered to one, but if you'll notice, He knew where that person was. The Father had showed Him. He healed this one. Perhaps he--he wasn't crippled. He was just laying on a pallet, but Jesus healed him. And then farther in the chapter, we find about the 19th verse, that He was questioned by the Jews. Perhaps, it would be questionable today why God would pass through a place where all those people were lame and halt and blind, and would not heal them all. But here I'll quote His Words. He said, "Verily, verily, I say unto you, the Son can do nothing of Himself, but what He sees the Father do: this doeth the Son likewise."

L-4 Then according to His Own Words, His ministry was based upon visions from His Father. Would not be strange then that His ministry should be carried on as He promised His disciples, "The things that I do, shall you do also. Greater than this shall you do, for I go unto My Father." He said, "A little while and the world seeth me no more, yet ye shall see me, for I'll be with you, even in you, to the end of the world: Jesus Christ the same yesterday, today, and forever." I believe it's a confirmation in this last days of the resurrection of Jesus Christ, living among His people, performing the same signs and wonders that He did when He was here on earth. At the age of seven, we moved from Kentucky to Indiana, up the road a bit from where we live now. We packed our water then from a well, some city block (I suppose) behind the old country home. One beautiful September afternoon, while coming from the pump with some water, there was a stately poplar tree stood about halfway between the pump and the home.

L-5 Passing by there, there was a whirl of wind in the tree, what we call here a whirlwind. Why, it was nothing odd for that time of year in this part of the country. But it remained in the tree. It didn't leave. I stopped to see what it was. And a Voice spoke from It, saying, "Do not never smoke, or drink, or defile your body in any way, for there'll be a work for you to do when you get older." 53-0800, The Twentieth-Century Prophet , Branham Home & Unknown, Jeffersonville, IN & Chicago, IL, 18 min Frightened? That's not a word for it. I ran home quickly, telling my mother that a Man spoke to me out of a tree. Well, she thought I was nervous. She put me to bed. But from then on, visions begin to come. And when this comes upon me, it produces a vision. I'm able to tell people what's wrong with them, and what they must do in life, and the sins that they are holding back in their life. At the age of thirty-seven, one night I was praying in my room, and when I'd raised up, I noticed there was a Light on the floor. And looking around to see where it come from, It was coming from above. The Pillar of Fire was hanging just above, and was throwing the Light on the floor. I heard someone walking. I looked; coming through the room, coming into this Light, came a man. In human figure He'd be about two hundred pounds of weight. He had dark hair to His shoulder, an olive complexion. He was bare-footed.

L-6 Of course, I was frightened, and he said to me, "Fear not." And as soon as I heard that voice, I knew it was the same voice that had always spoke to me, but the first time I had ever seen Him in human form. He said, "I am sent from the Presence of God to tell you that you're to pray for sick people. Great signs and wonders will be following your ministry, and you'll be praying for kings and monarchs and so forth." Well, I told him I was a poor man. I had no education. I would not be able to do this job. He said, "As Moses was given two signs of confirmation of his ministry, that I would be given two signs. One would be the praying for the sick, the miracles, and the other would be you'd know the very secrets of the people's heart."

L-7 I told him that I had been praying about this, that the people told me that it was of the devil--the ministry. He referred to me many Scriptures, such as when Philip found Nathanael, and Nathanael came to Jesus. Why, Jesus told him where he had been, where he was under the tree when Nathanael found him. And many other Scriptures, such as the woman at the well, how that she was revealed, her sins to her, when Jesus told her that she had five husbands. She ran into the city, and said, "This is the Christ." Many other Scriptures He referred to. I told Him I would go. He give me the assurance that He would be with me always, as you know, Brother Kopp, and the world knows, of the great things that's been taking place in the ministry.

L-8 We were thinking about whether these visions I would remember them very long. Sometime ago I had one, about four years ago to be exact, of a little boy being dead on the side of the road, struck by a car and killed. And he was to be raised from the dead. Well, I told everybody about it, prophesied throughout the United States and Canada. Thousands of Bibles had it written on their flyleaf, that this would take place. One day while we were having campaigns in the Scandinavian country, we were coming down through Finland, from Kuopio. And there was a group of people gathered on the side of the road. They were hovered over some sort of a form. We got out to look. There it was, the little boy, everything, the scene, just the way it was shown to me. I said to Brother Moore, "Look at your Bible and see if this isn't the scene."

L-9 "Yes," he said. I knelt down and asked our Lord Jesus to confirm His Word that He'd showed me, and had told me would come to pass. The little boy was brought to life again by our Lord Jesus. He's alive and healthy today. Brother Kopp, this is just a few of the things that our Lord Jesus is doing today in the ministry that He has committed to me. To my humble opinion, it's to confirm His Word. The things that He promised that would happen in this day, we're seeing them take place today. Now, concerning the campaigns in Israel, Brother Kopp, I'll be very happy to serve our Lord in Israel. I believe that my ministry will be very effective to the Jews, because as the Scripture says, "The Jews seek signs, the Greeks, wisdom."

L-10 [Brother Kopp says, "We believe many Jews, and others there in the holy land, will come to believe that the Lord Jesus Christ is the Messiah, when they see a Christian fulfilling the prophecy of Joel in the Old Testament."--Ed.] Yes, Brother Kopp, I'm sure that you're referring to Joel's prophecy in the Old Testament, Joel 2:28, how that He prophesied, saying that in the last days He would pour out His Spirit upon all flesh. The sons and daughters would prophesy. The old men would dream dreams, and the young men would see visions. [Brother Kopp says, "Well, Brother Branham, I guess we'll have to say good-bye for this time. It certainly has been a great pleasure and very edifying. We'll have to be running along. But we will see you, God willing, in Chicago, in the next couple of days."--Ed.] 53-0800, The Twentieth-Century Prophet , Branham Home & Unknown, Jeffersonville, IN & Chicago, IL, 18 min

L-11 Well, gentlemen, it's been a pleasure to have you in our home tonight. We'll be praying together for the success of the Chicago meeting. And by God's grace, I hope to meet you there in the next few days. [Sister Meda Branham says, "Would you care for some tea before going?"] [Brother Kopp says, "Oh, well, thank you very much, Sister Branham. That'll be just fine." Brother Leroy Kopp and his son, Paul Kopp, say, "Thank you."--Ed.] Thanks, honey.

L-12 [Remaining portion is from a prayer line in the Chicago campaign--Ed.] Now, to you who believe, the Angel of God, Who has been sent to me to help you to believe Jesus Christ, is not two foot from where I'm standing right now. If you believe me to be His servant, you shall take my word. I can't make you believe it. You only have to... See? But He's here now at the platform. Now, the Lord bless you, while I talk to the woman. Every one be in prayer. These are sick people. Now, if this lady says that she is a stranger to me... I never seen her in my life, no way at all of knowing her, anyway at all. Now, I could not heal her no more than I could save her; and you know I couldn't do that. But Jesus Christ has already did all of that when He died at Calvary.

L-13 But He sent gifts into His Church. Is that right? If it is, say, "Amen." [Congregation says, "Amen."--Ed.] And the gifts are to (what?) edify the Church. Is that right? In other words, they'd be believers, unbelievers come in, and say, "Truly..." The Bible said, "If you all speak with tongues, and there come in the unbelievers, well, they'll say you're mad. But if there be one prophesy and reveal the secrets of the heart, then won't that unbeliever fall down and say, 'Truly God is with you.'" Is that right? That's exactly right. All right. You believe now with all your heart that Jesus Christ, the Son of God, is here now to perform and to do the thing that He promised He would do.

L-14 Lady, I just want to talk to you as... in the... The reason I'm doing this is to contact your spirit. Will you believe with all your heart? And if God will just reveal to me what is wrong with you, will you accept Him as your Healer? You would. Now, we're strangers I suppose, are we? Never seen each other in life, nowhere? But God knows what's wrong with you, isn't that right? You, one of your greatest things, you are anemia also. Isn't that right? You believe that God will make you well. Lord Jesus, I pray that You'll heal the woman. Make her well, Father. May she go from here tonight and be made completely whole, in Jesus Christ's Name I ask it. Amen.

L-15 Now go, rejoicing. Pray. Now, that's according to your faith, sister. See? He never told me one thing. Just said what was wrong with you. Watch what He says. See? What He tells you, that you do. Now, it's totally up to you. See? You believe it. You said you'd accept it. Now He took you at your word. You take Him at His Word. Go testify the same you'll get well. Amen. Let's say, "Thanks be to God." Amen. I'm trust that God is blessing you all out there now to where you can't disbelieve any longer. It would be a--a--a sin for you to disbelieve now. After God has sent His Son, and has performed this thing that He speaks of now, and has done all these signs, and you... and sent His Bible, sent His preachers, sent His gifts, and you still disbelieve Him, there's nothing left for you but to be condemned at the end. Is that right?

L-16 But the only thing this is to do is to glorify God and to reveal Jesus Christ, that... When He was here on earth, He did this very same thing. All Bible readers believe that, say, "Amen." [Congregation says, "Amen."--Ed.] And He said, "When I go away, and I'll come again. A little while and the world will see Me no more (That's the unbelievers.), but ye shall see Me (Who? the believers), for I'll be with you, even in you, to the end of the world." Is that true? Then it's sin to disbelieve. "Go ye and sin no more (or disbelieve no more) or a worse thing than this will come upon you," said Jesus. Is that true? Then we must believe. It's got to be a believe or perish.

L-17 If I was God, if they couldn't take my word for it, that would settle it. But people still don't take the Word, then signs and wonders are added into the Church, as Jesus Christ promised to do. And to my honest belief, I believe He's finishing up right now with the Gentiles, and will turn to the Jews right away. And the Gentiles will be left in their dogmas and the things that they got, and their creeds, and cold, formal denominations. And the Church will be raptured 53-0800, The Twentieth-Century Prophet , Branham Home & Unknown, Jeffersonville, IN & Chicago, IL, 18 min and took up. And the Gospel will go to the Jews. Amen. "Amen" means "so be it." All right.

L-18 Excuse me, sister. Have to relax my mind once in a while. Now, we'll be strangers. I see that you are strictly a stranger to me. You're from away from here. You've come from another city. You've got a lot of trouble on your heart. And you got heart trouble, to begin with. Is that right? There's a whole lot of blackness. I see a black sheet keep following you like that. Oh, it's a lie. Somebody's told a lie on you, and that was a man was professing Divine healing. [The sister says, "Yes, sir."--Ed.] He said you was a witch. ["Yes."] Is that true? And you--you got a whole stir in your church, or something another, about it. Isn't that right? Your pastor's sick right now. He has got polio. Is that right? ["Yes, sir."] Sister, don't pay no attention to what them people tell you. They're a lying. And the only thing's wrong with your heart is that nervous condition, got your heart worked up. Go on home in peace, and God bless you. You're all right. God bless you. You're not a witch.

L-19 You believe with all your heart? Believe God will heal you with that cancer. Believe He will make you well if I'd ask Him. Lord Jesus, I pray that You'll heal the woman. And may she get completely whole. I ask this blessing in Jesus Christ's Name. Amen. Go on your road, rejoicing, saying, "Thank You, Lord," and you'll get well. Come, lady. Almighty God, Author of Life, give this woman her perfect health in Jesus Christ's Name. Amen. God bless you. Just a minute. Something happened to you. You know that. You're aware of that. Isn't that right? Why, it's all over the building, and every person here could be healed right now if you'd believe it. You believe this? [Congregation says, "Amen."--Ed.] Have faith in God. Are you one of the ushers, sir? All right, sir.

L-20 That lady setting right there, got heart trouble, that speckled dress on. Stand up, lady. He just healed you then of that heart trouble. You believe that with all your heart? All right. There sets a lady there with her handkerchief up, crying, just had a lick on the head the other day. She has got a headache that causes it. Is that right? Stand up and accept your healing in Jesus Christ's Name. Amen. How many of the rest of you wants to accept your healing? Jesus Christ is right here now to heal you. Do you believe that? All that wants to be healed, stand to your feet right now. Every person in the building that wants to be healed, stand to your feet. Raise up your hands like this to God. Almighty God, the Author of Life, the Giver of every gift, as Thy Spirit is here tonight, I pray that You'll heal every person in this building. Thou art here. The Holy Spirit is here. And I, now, as Your servant, along with these other servants, curse every disease that's in here. May the Jesus Christ the Son of God heal every person in here. Satan, leave these people in Jesus Christ's Name. Now, let the people that's got their hands up, say, "Praise God," and go to rejoicing, giving God... [Congregation says, "Praise God."--Ed.] All right, Brother Boze. Courtesy of Living Word Broadcast P. O.
