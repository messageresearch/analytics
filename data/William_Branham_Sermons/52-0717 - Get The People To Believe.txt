--- TRANSCRIPT ---

L-1 Thank you. Good evening, friends. I'm very happy to be here again tonight to worship our Lord. Who could look in the face of that, and say, "There is no God?" Isn't that beautiful? I think of... Just think of all the science in the world, there's none of them could even make a piece of that leaf. It's got life in it. See? They make something looks lively, but it won't have life in it. God only can produce life. Now, we are happy to be here. Very hot... And we give out tonight that I'm going to pray for the sick. And I--I want to live true to my promise. You... How many believes in being led to do things. I--I believe in it. I'm just going to step over here to this microphone just a minute, 'cause I believe you can hear better from here, don't you? And I'm not very big, and I haven't got very much voice. And so I can't talk too loud. And so I want you to hear what I'm going to speak about just for a few moments before we form a prayer line. And I'm definitely sure that God wants me to do this.

L-2 First, I want to read some of His blessed Word. And I was standing behind the curtain to--to hear the letter read just now about the lady, that the Angel of the Lord pointed out here in the building, that was laying there, and telling her condition, how she was dying with cancer; and the woman with her with dropped colon, and so forth. And here they are writing back, that they're both perfectly normal and well. Well, that alone, brother, is worth every... That ought to just take all the unbelief away from everybody. See? When He speaks and pronounces something, no matter how far it's gone, it's going to be just that way. See? I--I never seen it to fail. See? It never will. It can't fail. Now, I can fail, 'cause I'm a man. But when He speaks that inspiration, that will always be just that way. See? And it never fails.

L-3 Now, there's many times that I can speak to people, and talk to them, and things; or if I go, and if the anointing is very deep, and I go to talking to people, why, the first thing you know, a vision will break before me. And I could speak to the person; maybe that would... And they can't hide their life. So that'll probably inspire them. But that doesn't heal them. You see? But I've always thought... And in Africa this worked perfectly. And when I would--would just... They would see something done, something or other in the inspirational line like that, some person that they knowed that that's what was wrong with them, they would all massive by one--one accord, just accept it every bit then. And--and they would go to getting well and getting up, and--and getting around. See? But it seems to be just a little bit harder in America to do so. And now, the thing of it is, that we've had so much teaching, and so much everything else, until that it's--it's kinda got us all tore up. But yet I believe that God's going to move right down among us tonight. And here's one thing that I want to confess. See? When I'm wrong, I'm wrong. I believe that I have allowed too much of the ministry to the... just waiting and watching, and being sure that what I'm speaking, instead of just praying for the people. You see? For it's the prayer of faith that saves the sick. That's right. See? Sometimes they're own prayer... But sometimes a prayer of intercession will--will help out.

L-4 Now, I wish to read something about prayer over here in the good Book, in James the 5th chapter, beginning with the 14th verse. Everyone listen closely now. Is any sick among you? let him call the elders of the church; and let them pray over him, anointing with oil in the name of the Lord: The prayer of faith shall save the sick... the Lord shall raise him up; and if he has committed any sins, they shall be forgiven him. Confess your faults one to another, and pray one for the other, that you may be healed. The effectual fervent prayer of a 52-0717, Get The People To Believe, Civic Center, Hammond, IN, 80 min righteous man availeth much. The effectual fervent prayer of a righteous man... (Now, a righteous man is not a sinless man. See? A righteous man is a man who is confessing his sins in a righteous One. You see? See, a righteous man... Now, watch, to prove it, the next verse:) Elias was a man subject to like passions as we are (See?), and he prayed earnestly that it might not rain: and it rained not on the earth by the space of three years and six months. (A man that has his ups-and- downs, just like we do, not an Angel, a man... See?) And he prayed again, and the heavens gave rain, and the earth brought forth her fruit.

L-5 May the Lord bless His Word. Now, Elijah was not an Angel; he was a man. And he had his ups-and-downs, and his troubles like we do. And he had his passions. The Bible said he was a man with like passions--subject to like passions as we are. He was just as apt to make a mistake as you are or I am. He's just as apt to do something wrong as you are or I am. But he prayed earnestly that it might not rain. And it rained not for the space of three years and six months. Think of that. God listened to a mortal's prayer. And I say this with--with all true reverence: there is not another force on earth; there's not nothing on earth, no matter what it is, what kind of gifts it is; there's nothing in the world that will come ahead of prayer. Prayer is what does the work.

L-6 And when the Angel of the Lord, giving me my commission, He said to me, "You was borned into this world to take a gift of Divine healing to the peoples of the world." And I said, "Sir, I am uneducated. And I'm brought among my people, and we're all poor. And I--I have no education. The people would not believe me, Sir. And I could not do that." And He said, "As the prophet, Moses, was given two signs to a vindicate his sending of God, so will you be given two signs for this a vindication." Said, "One of them will be, that you will take the people by the hand." And said, "In there, just keep quiet, and it'll be told to you. You'll just say what's wrong with the person."

L-7 Well, I couldn't understand that. But it's not for me to understand. It's for me to believe it. See? And I can't figure it out. I don't know. And as we were saying here the other night, one of the men that even made fun, and said, "That's wrong." Said, "That's absolutely wrong," the man was stricken in the pulpit. It paralyzed his hand. His hand's spotted all over like leprosy today--that one hand. Will appear in my next meeting as a testimony. See? It was truth. He said, "Now, it'll come to pass after that, if they won't believe that, it'll come to pass that you'll know the very secrets of the people's heart." And said, "When you tell them that, they'll believe that, for they'll have to." See? And I said, "Well, that's what I was here for, Sir." I said, "I--I--I've come here because ministers has told me that was the wrong thing. And I would get all... And that's why I'm here." And He... Then He quoted the Scripture to me. And It referred to me, "Knowest thou not the Scriptures?" Said, "How that Jesus told Nathanael where he was at, when he was under the tree before he called him; knew the secrets of the woman's heart after He had talked to her awhile at the well." He referred me to those Scriptures. And then He told me that Jesus said He would be the same yesterday, today, and for ever. And He left me.

L-8 Now, anybody can come in here. I realize this, Christian friends. And remember, I'm not de-Christianizing. I'm not saying one word against anybody. No matter if you're a Roman Catholic, or if you're a Orthodox Jew, whatever you are. If you're a Methodist, Baptist, Pentecost, whatever you might be, that doesn't matter to me. If you've received Jesus Christ as your Saviour and God as your Father, you're my brother (See?) and sister. That's right. I don't care what church. Now, I realize that there might be possible, which there is... Now, we all believe here that there is a true God, and that there is a true Christian. Don't you believe that? We all believe that. Well then, we know that there is some that doesn't live like Christians. We know that they claim to be Christians, but they are not Christians. You know them by their fruit. They say they are, but they can't produce what they're talking about. Is that right? And Jesus said, "By their fruits, you shall know them." 52-0717, Get The People To Believe, Civic Center, Hammond, IN, 80 min Now, when you see one that claims to be, and isn't, and God isn't with the person to show that He's living in their life, then you know that the Father is testifying to you that by their fruits you'll know that he isn't a Christian from the... You can't judge him. You've no right to judge him. Just know him by his fruits. Is that right?

L-9 Now, if I come here and tell you that God told me to come down and to--and to heal the sick, and to open the eyes of the blind, to unstop the deaf ears, and... Well, that's good. You... "Well, all right now, Brother Branham. If God told you to do that, I'll--I'm going to look at your meetings. If He told you to do that, and this man comes to you and asks you for that, give you all the plea that he can, then I--I believe you're right. If you do that, I--I see; I say God is with you. That's what God told you to do." See? Then you have to notice. When you testify of something, if God... If a man testifies, you have a right to doubt that (See?), or not doubt it, but to watch it. And then if God testifies to the same thing, that it's absolutely the truth, then that's not the man's testimony, that's God confirming that testimony. Isn't that right?

L-10 Now, if you'll notice, the commission of the--the great One Who came... Now, I do not worship that Angel. I mean many many times... And when this group of people tonight, of some nearly thirty-five hundred or four thousand people... When we--when we stand together in the Presence of God, I will have to give account. And I... And--and wouldn't I rather to meet a thing... Now, just a minute, Christians, just a minute. Now, this Angel of God, and this Light that they took... that... I don't know what done that. But this Angel of God, I--I don't know about that. And in that--that... I'd--I want to be truthful, that when I stand before my Maker, that my records can be read what I told you. See? If there's anything I got to confess, I want to confess it now, right now. And then the only thing that I can do, is be honest.

L-11 And these things that He predicted by His Spirit back there, telling me would come to pass. And many of you here are--are-- followed me in the virgin meetings, when I was just in the beginning. And it has come to pass just exactly the way that He said it would. Has it? Is it the truth? How many knows that was back there at the beginning when I knowed nothing about the other. I'd just take the person by the hand. How many remembers that, and predicting that other shall be? Now, I give you hundreds of hands. And now, hasn't it come to pass just like He said? Well now, the Bible said, "If there be one among you who is spiritual or a prophet, I the Lord will make Myself known unto him. And what he says comes to pass, then hear it, for I am with that man." Is that right? "I am with that person." Now, here it is, comes to pass here. Now, I've tried to tell you that there's nothing about me that would heal anybody. I have no magic power...

L-12 [Blank.spot.on.tape--Ed.]... paid the price. He's the only one that can heal. He did it at Calvary. And for me to do something that He did at Calvary would be robbing Him of His Calvary sacrifice. So I can't do it, Christian friends. And to be honest with you, I don't believe there's anyone else that can do it. I believe the only thing that any man can do to you, is get your faith pointed towards Calvary. He might preach you the Gospel so plain, that--and--or talk to you in such a way that you would see: "There it is. He knows what he's speaking about. He speaks with earnestness. He proves it by the Scriptures that that is the sacrifice. That's the thing." And you look there and get well. I believe anything else outside of leading you to Calvary would be wrong (See?), anything outside of Calvary, like it would be in--in the person.

L-13 But I said that the Lord said, that these things that would take place would--would come from Him, that He sent me to--not to heal people. But watch. He said, "You were given a gift." Now, when you call, talk about "the gift," there is no such a thing. That's unscriptural. "The gift..." I Corinthians 12, said, "gifts," plural. So there's no "the gift." It's "a gift." See? And it might be one work one way, another through teaching the Word, through something else, or--or however it is--knowledge, and all these things. It works in with the--with healing. It's faith in healing. That's what it is. And now, you don't have to wait to be a minister to do that. You don't have wait to be a--a deacon. You don't... Only thing you have to do is have faith in God. And the Bible said, "Pray one for another. If there's any among you sick, don't even bother the pastor, call the elders of the church, let them pray for you." Is that right? I just read it. And that's 52-0717, Get The People To Believe, Civic Center, Hammond, IN, 80 min the rule. And then It said, "Confess your faults one to another, and pray one for another that you may be healed; for the effectual fervent prayer of (a deacon? No. of an elder? No.)--of a righteous man (a good man.)..." If the man's sincere and believes, "an effectual fervent prayer of that righteous man availeth much." See?

L-14 Now, that in other words, here you're standing here; this man is praying for you, trying to help you. And you're believing with all your heart. And both of you together as two witnesses are coming before God. Something's bound to move. Now, something's got to happen now, in healing. Now, this--this gift of seeing, that's just as same to me as it would be for you to set down at the table and eat when you're hungry. See? It's just there. I never put it there; it never come there. And if I testify of that, and it's wrong, God doesn't testify of it, then you say He's wrong. But brother, not in the meeting. But the things that's predicted will be, come to pass time after time, place after place, and everywhere, in different positions and times, and so forth. And every time hit's perfect. Why? It's God speaking, not me. I didn't know what was going to happen. But He knows all the future. Don't you believe that? And He can drop it to us as He will. Now, those things are true.

L-15 But the Angel said to me, "If you'll get the people to believe..." Now, listen closely to all... We're going to pray for a group of people, I believe, tonight. "If you get the people to believe you." To believe what? To believe that God sent me to pray for you (See?), that God's got--sent me to... Not for my own merit, what He did before I was borned, He gave that. And I'm to pray for you. "If you get the people to believe you, and then be sincere when you pray..." There's the thing. Well now, instead of that, when it begin to come up, I begin to... Everything I done, I just set still. I watched over the audience. And where the heavenly Father would show me something, I'd speak that. And I'd speak this. And the first thing you know, it's just a very few gets to the line. And I'm just so weak, that they just take me out.

L-16 Now, it isn't while I'm standing up there on the platform, I could stand there hour after hour. But it isn't when I'm outside after I've got to myself all right. It's when coming in between there. See? It's coming down, when you start to leave the platform. And I'd turn around and I'd feel that just go, "Whosh [Brother Branham illustrates--Ed.]." Oh, where You at? What's happened? Where... There you are. See, you wonder if you're going this a way, or that way, or--or what are you doing. You don't know whether you're walking, crawling, or somebody leading you. See? And then in a few minutes, you--you begin to think, "I'm--I'm at the meeting now. Yeah, I'm... That's all right." And then I--I don't want to talk about the meeting then. I go to talking about something else.

L-17 And Mr. Bosworth, and many of you here has talked. They'll start, and they'll say, "Say, it's a nice night. Isn't it lovely? The stars are pretty," or something like that. They never mention the meeting, never say nothing for about a hour or two. And then Mr. Baxter, Mr. Bosworth, or whoever it is, may come to my room, taking my wife or my son, or whoever is with me. "How's he feeling?" All right. Maybe I'm lying down then, maybe reading the Bible. They come in and say, "Oh, Brother Branham, it was a marvelous meeting. What happened, brother?" Isn't that right, Brother Bosworth. "What happened?" Then they'll set down and reveal the meeting to me. Why, I say, "I remember the--one or two people I was taking to, or the vision come. But then it just went out on me." See? Well, so much of that. See? And I allowed too much to that instead of doing what He told me to do, to pray for the people.

L-18 Now, I've noticed this. And I believe that man that are borned again are lead by the Spirit of God. Do you believe that? I just want you to notice something right here. I was hoping Brother Baxter would be present. But I think someone parked their cars wrong out there, and they had some time out there tonight about parking in a place. We couldn't get the car there in here, or something. He went out to see about that, he and Brother Cox's, and them. But I'd rather him to be here. Now, every time that I seem to follow what I'm led to do, just a leading. Wherever I feel led to go, it's always best to do just what I feel led to do. 52-0717, Get The People To Believe, Civic Center, Hammond, IN, 80 min

L-19 And now, how many was here Sunday and heard me tell the vision and the things that's going to come to pass? I see. All right. If you'll notice in there, when I asked Him about the meeting, I said, "How shall I hold the meeting?" Said, "Just as you're led to do." See? That is, there's no cut and dried program of it. Whatever God leads to do. And friends, since I was coming up, my wife (Somewhere here in this building, with the baby.), was coming up the other day, and my son, who's probably back with his mother somewhere, or up in the balcony, or somewhere... Now, coming up the road the other day, after I'd went down... And by the way, the boy, the latest boy that we've had prayer for here, that stays with me, her boy is healed and well now. We thank God. They thought he was taken polio. He's a young minister, a veteran out of the army, and he's all right now. And the lady's back home. So mother leaves in the morning with the baby. We're getting ready then. Go right straight from here to Zion City.

L-20 I've got a testimony from Zion for you. A young fellow who's waiting near in a few minutes now to come to the platform. Now, this... In--in doing in this, I have always noticed if something comes to me and begins to speak to me, many times I'd cut that away. And God will bless, but not like He will if you'll do what He tells you to do, feel led of doing it. And coming up the other day, I said, "How many remembers I asked you to pray for me, that God would confirm that in my heart, what..." Do you remember? have you been praying? Well, here's what it was, was what I'm fixing to do tonight: pray for the people. That's right. That's what He seemed to...

L-21 Now, when I left... Now, Brother Baxter, I hope if he's standing near, that he will come forward, if he's near, to--in confirmation of this. If I don't, I'll mention it when he comes to the platform. That when we would... I was here in America after the vision of being seen, about the little boy being raised from the dead. It went down in many, many Bibles. Many of you setting here tonight, heard it said. How many in here heard it said about a little boy going to be resurrected, even before it come to pass? Let's see your hands go up. Look over this building around the audience. I guess at least two or three hundred people right here. A year or more before it come to pass (See?), that it was going to be, described just how he looked, and told you it would be in "The Voice of Healing." Is that right? And it appeared just exactly that way, and it was the same type of boy. Is that right?

L-22 Now, the Lord seemed to speak to me, "Go to Finland." Well, I left to Finland. Now, while I was over there, the brethren said, "Let's go over to Sweden." That's all right. "Over to Norway." That's all right. But there wasn't any of them I was led to. I was led to Finland. The meetings in Norway were all right. The meetings in Sweden was all right, but nothing like Finland. That's where the Lord said, "Go." Led to go to Finland. Then going to South Africa, He led me to one place: Durban, South Africa. Brother Bosworth, you're a witness to that, and Brother Baxter and them: Durban.

L-23 And now, I--I just read the seventh grade readers, so I'm not very good on my geography. So I told my wife, and bless her heart, she's the sweetest woman in the world to me. Uh-huh. She's just about as bad as I am. So I told her, I said, "Honey, when you write me, you write me to Durban, Southern Rhodesia." And I thought surely Durban was in Southern Rhodesia. Why, it'd be like writing me to Hammond, British Colombia. See? It's another nation altogether, another place.

L-24 And here was my... I got down there, and I stopped at Johannesburg. I said, "Well--well, is--is this Southern Rhodesia?" "No, this is South Africa." "Well, what part of it is Southern Rhodesia?" "There is no Southern Rhodesia, South Africa." I said, "Well, where's Durban at?" "Oh," said, "that's plumb up over on the other coast." I said, "Well, there's where the Lord wants me to go. All my mail is being sent..." 52-0717, Get The People To Believe, Civic Center, Hammond, IN, 80 min And she sent me the baby's picture, and so forth, to carry with me. And I never got it till I was about a--a week before I come home. Because, here come my mail plumb down into Durban. And I thought I was going to Durban. And all other the meetings was wonderful.

L-25 People are setting here that's come all the way from South Africa here, from them meetings, to be in this meeting here. And the meetings are wonderful everywhere. But there wasn't any other meeting even shadowed Durban. Is that right, brother? Durban had the place. Durban was the call. And if you'll find out, I'll do this: if I'll just do what God leads me to do, it's always the best. Now, I'm going to ask you something tonight. I'm going to call a large prayer line here. I don't know. I'm know this one thing. Even before I come to the platform here, the Holy Spirit was with me. He met me even before I come on the grounds tonight, 'fore Billy come out there and picked me up, and said, "Daddy, I don't know how you can get your car in there tonight." I said, "Well, let's drive around the block." We went around the block. And there was still a bunch of cars parked. And he said, "I don't know." We went around two times more. And finally we said, "We just got to go in, 'cause Brother Baxter will be calling me." I knowed His Presence was there.

L-26 I'm going to try tonight, even though if I see visions, I'm going to try keep it to my... close my eyes, or do something, until I absolutely bring the person up here, and pray for them, and let them go off the platform. See? I'm going to try to do that tonight, and pray for everybody as long as I can stand here to do so--to pray for everybody. Now, if... now, if He speaks it right out to me, I--I can't help it. You see? If it's something I believe in the person's life that that absolutely... If a sinner would happen to get in that line or something, I believe God would speak that sinner out. Uh-huh. If I'd see that, I'd probably call it out (See?), or something that I thought that would hindered you some way, I'd call that. Otherwise I'm going to try, if God will help me. See, if God will help me, just to not saying nothing about the vision, but pray for the person. And I want everyone that comes in this line, to do me this one favor, if you will. I want you to just be truthful before God. And if there is a change in your conditions within the next twenty-four hours...

L-27 I'll see how many that... with cards, and how many people we pray for, or how many people that comes in line, I'll let someone... (If the brethren there can keep a count of how many comes through.) And will you be honest enough with me? Now, I want to know. If you say, "Why, I--I've got better. There's something happened to me." I'd like to see what happens in the next twenty-four hours, because coming from my place... I come here tonight, and I said, "Dear heavenly Father, if this is You moving me in my heart, which I believe it is, then this will be the best... more results will happen tonight than any night of the meeting, if You're leading me." And I can't get away from it. I've tried it for three or four nights. Even last week I tried. I said, "Now, next... last Wednesday, Thursday, and Friday," I said, "We're not... just been bringing the people up and pray. I've tried." I said, "Well, Lord, maybe You didn't want it." Now, I can't get away from that, and I can't leave this city without doing that. God's calling me to just bring the people up here and pray for them. And I know it's the truth. And I want you to come by the bookstand and just write out a little... what your name is, whatever it is, and just say, "I... this is my condition after twenty-four hours," or something like that. "I--I--I'm healed, or I feel better, or I'm no better." And--or something on that order--what God has done for you... Would you do that? Say, "Amen?"

L-28 Now, I'll pray for just as many as I can. Then at the end of the service, I'll try make a committal prayer to all maybe that I can't get to. Now, this is something that I have not done for years. And I don't mean that one of those old fashion fast lines we used to send--me stand there unconscious and let the people pass by. Many got healed that way, true. I don't mean that. I want to bring you up here and talk with you, and pray with you, let you go off the platform. 52-0717, Get The People To Believe, Civic Center, Hammond, IN, 80 min That's what God says in His Word. That's what the commission of the Angel... And I'm always... I never did do that. And I want to try it in Hammond, Indiana, tonight to begin with. God helping me to do it.

L-29 How many believes Divine healing is lasting, let's see your hands? Little Mr. House, form Zion City, Illinois, I wish you'd come forward. Here's a little lad that was so cross-eyed that--in a meeting at Zion City, Illinois. His father is a minister of the Gospel. And he... I'm looking out here. He's--he travels across the country to see me. Look out to the audience there, and see how cross-eyed that child is. Then say, "How long does Divine healing lasting?" As far...?... Is that right? Look up in this way at this audience up here. See how perfectly straight his eyes is? Now look, sonny, up to this audience, you follow my finger with your eye. Don't--don't... not with your head, with your eyes... Cross-eyes are locked. You know that. All right, to this audience out here. Follow my finger, sonny. God bless you, sonny boy. I believe God's going to make a preacher out of him some of these days. God bless you.

L-30 Let's say, "Praise the Lord." That's been about three or four years ago. The boys eyes are still straight, and will ever remain straight. Now, just--he just happened to meet me out there and said, "You know me, Brother Branham?" He was a little tot then. And I said, "Don't believe I do." Said, "Do you remember Zion City, where the Chicago Tribune writer, and all them, wrote up that great article?" Said, "The main different between Reverend Branham..." (You've read it many times, I guess.), and said, "And most people: he believes the Bi--Bible." Said, "Could you imagine a man borned in the southern states, in Kentucky, picking up a little Negro child that was cross-eyed, from Walkeegen, from some kind of a slum down there (or something or other), and saying, 'Daughter, you're eyes will be straight.'" And said, "They come straight."

L-31 Look here. Let me tell you something. I don't care whether it's the Negro child, whether it's a Japanese child, whether it's a Chinese child, whether it's a Korean child, or whoever it is, God is no respect of person. That's God's child. That's right. I don't care whether you were born below the line, or above the line, or wherever you want to. You'll get in the--you'll get in the groove when God calls you. That's right. You'll get in the place where the Holy Spirit's a falling. God's no respecter of persons. That's right. You'll get right in the move with God, and you'll move in the Spirit. And there's no middle walls of partitions. Jesus Christ tore it all down and made all men brotherhood. Amen. I believe that with all my heart. It's truly I was borned a Southerner, a rebel. But I was borned again one day. That made the difference. Uh-huh. Amen.

L-32 You love Him? All right. Where's Billy Paul? Is he near? I don't even know... Where is he? See where he's at, if you will. And I don't even know... if he's give out prayer cards today. Or if he did, if he didn't, we'll try yesterday's, or--or something. Everybody love the Lord? That's wonderful. You going to be praying for me tonight? And I'm going to be praying for you. Now, if God... If the Holy Spirit of God has come down and revealed those things, the secrets of the hearts of the people, and has made it known that He's here, and His blessings is here... And you'll have to admit that every night of the meeting, it's been perfect every time, dozens after dozens, after dozens. Is that right? It's been perfect. All right.

L-33 Now, if that be so, then what I told you is the truth. Say, just a minute. I want to see you. I meant... Going overseas, Brother Baxter, the first time, I said, "I was led to go to Finland." Is that right? Finland is where the real meeting was, the best of meetings. Leading is what I'm talking about. Thank you, Brother Baxter. [Brother Baxter says, "You said when we were leaving Finland in the airplane, you said to me, 'Brother Baxter, my mission is complete over here now. I've done what the Lord sent me to do. We shall go to Norway and Sweden, but God sent me to Finland."--Ed.] (No. No, I don't want any water right now.)

L-34 This... I forgot saying that to him. See? And then in Africa, when we left Johannesburg, and they couldn't go to 52-0717, Get The People To Believe, Civic Center, Hammond, IN, 80 min Durban on account of a itinerary, I said, "As far as I'm concerned, the meeting's over. We're ready to go home." That's right. "As far as I..." See, when you get out of the leading of the Lord, it's something different. And I believe that God leads, and we should follow. Don't you think so? Thank you, Brother Baxter, and all of you tonight. The good Lord bless you. Pray now that God will help me tonight to pray for a great multitude of people. And I've asked them, Brother Baxter, if they would come to the bookstand tomorrow night, and let me see what happens to the number that's prayed for.

L-35 (Billy, did you give out prayer cards? What... what... O's.) All right. How many can we stand up here at a time? And don't be weary, we're will... If God willing, we're going to pray for a great group of you tonight, just as many as we possibly can pray for. And now, he's got a hundred of them. Could we send fifty of them up at a time? What say? But what... How many would you say stand? Twenty-five? All right, sir. Let the first twenty-five... O-1, O-2, O-3, O-4, O-5, line up down here till the first twenty-five. Then the next twenty-five, be ready. It won't be but a little bit till we'll have those prayed for. And then just so forth, and so on. And... Yes, if we... All right. He said, "It's just so warm to have them standing in a big row." O-1 to O-25, and then, you... How many here's got prayer cards that's been from other days? Have you got them here? Raise your hands. [Blank.spot.on.tape--Ed.] I seen that child in a vision...?... I don't recognize...?...

L-36 There's something about the child. I don't--I don't know. See? But I do want to pray for the baby. See? So you just... You--you live around here? You're from Peoria. Are you here to stay a few days? All right. We'll see. Maybe we can get to it tonight if I possibly can; I want to pray for the--for the baby. All right. You--you come, lady. There's something. I didn't see what happened. I seen what started it. It's was birth. But I--I--I didn't know just what happened to take place. Now, just a moment. I--I want to talk just a minute to this person so I know that the Spirit of God is on me. Now look. If this was my mother standing here and I was somebody else, I'd want that somebody else to be just at the best, and do everything they could to help my mother. See? And now, I--I want God to move, if He will, and to help me. And you pray for me now. And I... Just as the Spirit of God can get near, the Angel of the Lord, and then...

L-37 Now, I want you to--to talk to me just a minute. Do you believe that God will make you well, my sister? Do you believe that He will help you now, heal you, and will make you well? You do? You... Now, you believe that what I have said is the truth? Have you been to the meetings before? And you've watched what He's done out there? And--and you see all the great signs that He moves out through the places there, and heals those that are dying with cancers. And here's doctors sign their statements, send it back, healed. See? And here's those that are crippled and in wheelchairs, come walking in, those that are on crutches, and so forth in here. The Holy Spirit will move out there and say, "You done a certain-certain thing," call sinners, and all different kinds of people, telling them that. Do you believe that? Do you believe it's the truth coming from God? Well then, of course, you know I'd know what was wrong with you then. If I--if I wanted to speak it, I--I would know.

L-38 Now, friends, speaking to that woman like that, the Angel of the Lord is near. That's right. I feel the anointing now. Now, if when you pray that it... the visions won't break forth enough to--to make me... Well, right now--right now, He's just settling over this building. Now, that is the truth. Friends, I... Before God, His Presence is near. I know what's wrong with the lady. Yes, sir. All right. I want you to come here just a minute. I want to lay hands upon you, sister, as my sister.

L-39 Now, Jesus Christ said this, "Go into all the world and preach the Gospel." He said, "Lay hands on the sick; they shall recover. Prayer of faith shall save the sick," and many Scriptures. Do you believe that? You believe it? You haven't always believed it, but you believe it now. Is that right? You belong to some other kind of a church that didn't 52-0717, Get The People To Believe, Civic Center, Hammond, IN, 80 min believe that. Is that right? Uh-huh. But there's... That's all right. See, I'm not condemning. That's all right. Do you believe that I know what I'm speaking of? Huh? Yes, sir. Catholic. You're a Catholic? Is that right? I see you with a beads (See?), then repeat... See? That's right. You have stomach trouble, don't you? Sister, you're already healed, but I want to pray for you. Dear heavenly Father, to fulfill this mission that I have asked, I--I pray. Now, help me, dear God. I realize that this can't go very long. I--I ask You to make her well. God, may she just go out and testify among her people, telling what great things that You've done. This poor little gray headed woman standing here, I ask for mercy for her, Almighty God, and Jesus Christ, the Son of God. And through Thee only is there access to these things. And I ask, Father, in the Name of Thy Son, Jesus, that I--as I bless her, may You heal her. Amen. Now, little mother, you're going to be all right now. You go on, and just believe with all your heart, and you're going to be all right. Isn't He wonderful (Amen.), wonderful?

L-40 That you might know, you people that's coming through this line, the Holy Spirit is moving. He's here. Do you believe it? All right. All right, sir. Now, do you believe if I'll ask our dear Jesus to heal you, He will do it? You do? Well, you come close, dad. I want to pray for you. O Jesus, my Master, my poor brother stands here aged and sick. I pray for mercy for my dear brother. And may he go away from here tonight, Lord, and be well. Will You grant it? And may he get well, and go home, and be well and sound the rest of his life. Grant it, Father, in Jesus' Name. Amen. Now, my brother, I--I have blessed you by praying for you. Not I have, but I have asked God's blessings upon you. And now, you've tried hard to believe for a long time. Just to help your faith along, now you can go and eat your supper. Feel good... [Blank.spot.on.tape--Ed.] Yes, sir. Thank you. His stomach trouble that was bothering you, now, you just go ahead and eat tonight. You're going to be all right. All right. Now, let's say, "Praise be to God."

L-41 Now, little laddie boy, I want you to look this a away. You're a very fine little lad. And do you believe that Jesus Christ will--will hear my prayer, if I pray for you, honey? You do? Then you would--you would be happy to be well. See? But no matter if I don't tell you what's wrong with you... You know what's wrong with you. But if I don't tell you, will you believe just the same, won't you? All right. Now, you come near. I remember when my little boy... That's my boy, Billy Paul, there. And he... When he was just about your size, and oh, my, how I--I just hated... I liked to you see him get to be a man, but I hated to see him grow up. And your--your daddy, mother may be the same way. But when you come up, you going to love Jesus? You're going to love Him? That's fine. I want you to. And I just pray that God will bless you, honey, and will make you a man of God. And God will use your little life out there in His service somewhere.

L-42 Now, let's you and I pray. Dear Jesus, as this humble little lad leans his head over on my bosom tonight and prays, I ask, dear Father, that You heal his little body. And he's sincere. He comes here to be prayed for. He was in the line. And I ask You to make him well. Grant it, heavenly Father. And may he go out of here and get well. And may after while all of his sickness leave him, and he will get to be a man if God does tarry. And may he be a soul winner. Oh, I pray Father, that You'll make him a Gospel preacher, that he will--that he will just do Your work. Grant it, Lord. And hear the prayer of Your servant, as he--as he knows, and has heard You speak, that You commissioned me as Your servant to go pray for the sick, and--and to show signs and wonders of Jesus. He believes it. And I, with the--all the fervence that I know how to put into my prayer and affection, I ask for this little boy's healing. Grant it, Lord, in Jesus Christ's Name. Amen. Now, little laddie boy, I--I--I believe you're going to get well. You do, too. I think you're a mighty fine lad. And don't you come quite a distance to come here? Every night? And you--you come from--from Chicago. Is that right? Uh-huh. And you're suffering with a--a double rupture. Isn't that right? All right. Now, you go off the platform. And you thank Jesus and believe, and I believe you're going to get all right. God bless you. Bless his little heart. 52-0717, Get The People To Believe, Civic Center, Hammond, IN, 80 min

L-43 All right, would you come, lady? Now, young lady, I couldn't heal you if I had to. I'm--I'm your brother (See, I... ), and in Jesus Christ. And the only thing that I could do would be pray for you. Isn't that right? Now, you know what's wrong with you. And God knows what's wrong with you. And I know what's wrong with you. But there's no need of me telling you, because you already know. You believe that don't you? But now, if I'll ask Jesus to heal you, you'd believe you'll get well? You believe you will? God bless your heart, little lady. That's a horrible thing for a child to have. And that's right. Usually when they're--when they're older and they take that, they get over it pretty well. Isn't that right? But when they're young, then they don't--they don't do so well. But look, sister dear, Jesus Christ is here. He will make you well. You believe that, don't you? All right. Now, I'm His servant, and I pray. Now, the little girl... Of course, I know what's wrong with her. But that's all right. Now, heavenly Father, as Your humble servant, I ask You to heal this child. May she go off of the platform here and be happy, never have to take insulin no more, and be well, and made perfectly normal. Grant it, dear Lord. Through Jesus' Name I bless her with all my heart. As Your servant, I pray for her that You'll make her every whit whole. Grant it, dear God. And if--if there's anything in a way, please, God, forgive it just now. And I ask that she'll get well. And may the hour come where she'll be normal, well girl again in Jesus' Name. Amen. Now, God bless you, honey. Now, I know what's wrong with you. But I don't have to say it. You know. So now, you go along now. And God bless you.

L-44 All right, come lady. Oh, He's wonderful. I believe those people are getting--getting healed, don't you believe it? They are. I believe you are, too. Don't you believe it? I believe God's goodness is just pouring into you right now. Don't you? What is God's goodness? His faith pouring into you (See?), pouring into your spirit. Now, everyone reverent. Now, His Presence is here. Just because I'm not telling the people what's wrong with them, well, you just... See? You just remember that His Presence is here anyhow. See? His Presence is here. Do you believe that, lady? You do? You're a good believer. All right. Do you believe that He can make you well? You can? You know He can? Now, if I don't say a word to you, don't even mention your disease, or whatever's wrong with you... I--I don't know at this time. But if--if He will make known to me what it is... Or I don't have to that. If I'll just pray for you, you're going to get well, aren't you? You're going to get well. All right.

L-45 Now look, to help your faith so that you'll know, it's a very odd thing that's wrong with you. Isn't that right? And doctor after doctor can't tell you what's wrong with you. Is that right? Now listen, isn't it right in the back of your neck, a drawing? Isn't that right? Come here just a minute. Dear heavenly Father, before You a woman standing here. And she don't realize... And the doctor can't find that devil that's setting there, that's come upon her to afflict her. But, Lord, You know where he's laying there. And in the Name of Jesus Christ, I lay my hands on her neck and rebuke that demon. Come out of her, foul devil. Leave the woman that she can be made well. All right, sister... [Blank.spot.on.tape--Ed.] Go home believing with all your heart.

L-46 All right. Now, you come, lady. Do you believe with all your heart? All right. Now, I'm going to ask our Lord to bless you. And will you go home and get well, won't you? O Father, as Your humble servant, with all my heart... You said, "The effectual fervent prayer..." Oh, and I've come, Father, not in my own name, in my righteousness, neither in the righteousness of this church or this people. We've come in the righteousness of Jesus Christ, the Son of God. Because He, grace, oh, abounded greater than sin. And it went above sin. And it smothered sin out. And now... And smothering out sin, it smothered out sickness... [Blank.spot.on.tape--Ed.] And now, by the grace of Christ, by the great commission that was given, I now lay hands upon this woman in obedience to what my Master said, the last Words that came from His lips, "If they lay hands on the sick, they shall recover." You promised it, Master. In obedience to that, just as I was baptizing the woman here in a pool of water, I lay hands on her. With all my heart, I try to do, Master. Heal her sick body and may she get well in Jesus Christ's Name. Amen. God bless you, sister. I believe that we have struck faith to heal. Don't you? God bless you. 52-0717, Get The People To Believe, Civic Center, Hammond, IN, 80 min

L-47 All right. Now, come, lady. Now, do you believe with all your heart, believe that God will--will heal you if I'll ask Him? Now, it isn't my--my--my prayer that's going to heal you. See? The prayer of faith between us shall save the sick. See? Now, you believe that God hears my prayer? And you know, you being a Christian, you should believe, also. Now, I don't have to tell you what's wrong with you, though I know. But I don't have to tell you, just so I pray for you. Is that right? All right. 'Less you wanted me to tell you. See? All right. All right. Our heavenly Father, our sister comes now, and she's standing here wanting a blessing from You. She comes to me as Your servant. And I ask with all my heart that You'll heal the woman, and may she go away from here tonight, Lord, and be able to eat anything she wants to. May she come back tomorrow night rejoicing, happy, made well. God, heal the woman's body. I lay hands upon her, because You said so, not as a superstition. But You said, "They shall lay hands on the sick; they shall recover." And this whole group of Christians are joining with me in prayer for the healing of this woman's body in Jesus' Name. Amen. Now, sister, look out there. How many was with me in prayer then? Just raise your hands. Something has to go now, doesn't it? All right. You go and get well now in the Name of the Lord. All right.

L-48 God bless you, my brother. Do you believe that He will make you well? All right, sir. Now, heavenly Father, I pray Thee in the Name of Thy Son, Jesus, to heal our dear brother. Make him well. He needs You, Father, realizing without You, he might go at any minute. But Thou art here to make him well. And I pray, Father, now, as I lay hands upon him, as the great commission was given to heal the sick, I lay my hands upon him and ask for healing in Jesus' Name. Amen. Now look, sir, if there's a difference in that heart between now and tomorrow night, you write it back there. Will you? God bless you. All right. God bless you.

L-49 All right, young lady. Come. Do you believe me to be His servant? Have you been in the meetings before? You've never been in a meeting before? Well, then perhaps I'd better... Ma'am, I see. You just come in today? This is your... Well then, I'm a stranger, and you're a stranger. Perhaps I'll talk to you just a moment. See? Just that you come along way, something that you've never seen the meeting in operation before. Now, then I want you to look to me. Do you believe... Have you ever read my book, called, "Man Sent From God"? You've never read... No articles, or nothing? In the "Voice of Healing" you've read. Did it... In there, have you read in the Bible where Jesus knew the secrets of the hearts of the people? And when He talked to the woman at the well, He talked to her a little while, and He said, "Go get your husband." He went right straight to the point. Is that right? And He knew what she had done. She'd been living in adultery. He knowed her cause, and what was hindering her in life. That's right. All right. Now, if she had those husbands, and--and she was living wrong, then Jesus went right straight to the point.

L-50 Now, if He is the same today, and you're a stranger, just standing here before me, then I'll be able by His Spirit, if I be His prophet, to go right straight to where your trouble is (Is that right?) and tell you what's wrong with you. Then will you believe me to be His prophet? You suffer with TB. It's in the throat. And now, do you believe now? And now, do you believe if I pray for you that you'll--you'll get well? See? Now, you've been suffering like that, caused you trou... Yes. Now look, another thing would you do, would you promise to serve God all your life, with all your heart, and live for Him? You will? And you'll throw away every superstition, everything else, and serve God the rest of your life? Is that right? You'll do it? Now, if I pray for you, I want you to believe, sister. Father, I pray for this poor little woman. She's standing here. And I know she doesn't have very long to live without You. And I pray that You'll make her well; heal her. May she go away from here. And now, as this germ has set into her throat and in her chest... And God, we realize that if--if through this irritation, that it can't be much longer now; it'll take her life. But Thou art here to heal her. And she's unaware of the danger. And God, as she's trying to press into the Kingdom, I ask You to heal the woman. May she go from here, and get well, and serve You all the days of her life, and be filled with Your Spirit, and be a testimony in the country she comes from, in Jesus Christ's Name. Amen. Now, go rejoicing, believing God. You shall get well. 52-0717, Get The People To Believe, Civic Center, Hammond, IN, 80 min

L-51 All right, come, lady. Do you believe, sister? With all your heart? Now, Father, I pray for our sister, that You'll heal her and make her well. Grant it, Lord, that You--Your Spirit will come upon her. Then if her body will be made well... Grant it, Father, In Jesus Christ's Name, I ask it. Amen. Have you been in our meetings before? Never been in the meetings before? This is your first time? Oh, I see. I'm--you see want I'm trying to do tonight, is pray for the sick. Now, I just put my hands on you and pray for you. But do you believe that you are healed? Now, perhaps, what if I tell you what was wrong with you, then you--you will accept it? Will you? Have female trouble. Is that right? All right. You can go and get well. The lady with TB said bronchitis. She didn't know she's had bronchitis for quit a while. But she had TB. That's exactly what it was. I'd take that. I know exactly that's right. See? She said... I seen her moving, like that. But when I put my hand over on her, I knowed it was TB. That's exactly right. So everyone be reverent. All right.

L-52 Heavenly Father, I pray for this woman that You will heal her and make her well. Grant that Your Spirit come upon her, and that the prayer of faith shall save the sick. I ask, dear God, that You make her completely healed in Jesus' Name. Amen. Now, you believe, sister? All right. Go off the platform. Say, "Thank You, Jesus." And return back rejoicing, happy. All right. You and the little girl? Both, both of you? Now, do you believe that Jesus can make you well? Our heavenly Father, as I lay hands upon the both, I pray with all my heart that You... As I stand here tonight representing You, I represent You, Father, in this way: that You are the same yesterday, today, and forever. And I pray that You'll heal both the lady and the little girl. And--and Father, that You'll make them both well. May they come back tomorrow night, testifying, saying, "Oh, I'm healed, both the little girl and I both." Grant it, Father, in Jesus Christ's Name. Then, Father, I just conclude these meetings this way till You tell me to stop. Amen. All right. Now, go; I want to hear from you tomorrow night. Now, believe with all your heart.

L-53 Now, come. Do you believe with all your heart? You believe that God will make you well if I'll ask Him to? You will? All right. Now, heavenly Father, as I join with the thousands of others in here are Christians who believe that these people are going to be made well, I ask for the healing of this woman. May she go off this platform and be healthy and happy, and return back tomorrow night, testifying what has been done for her through Jesus' Name. Amen. Now, God bless you, sister. Now, it's just... I say this--as you have believed, so will it be unto you. God bless you. All right. Will you come, lady. Now, do you believe? All right. you've been in meetings before, haven't you? You've been here. You know all about what takes place, don't--don't you? All right. Now, do you believe that the Spirit of the Lord is here? Is that right? All right. Our heavenly Father, I pray for this woman in the Name of Your Son, Jesus, that You heal her body. Grant it, Lord, that the woman will be made completely whole. In Jesus Christ's Name I rebuke this spirit of sickness upon the woman. Amen.

L-54 Just a minute. Excuse me, audience. The colored lady setting there, a young woman, do you have a prayer card, with a green looking dress on? You setting there. You don't have a prayer card. Stand up just a minute. Oh, yes, there it was. Uh-huh. All right. Do you believe? You had stomach trouble, too, didn't you? Isn't that right? Didn't you have stomach trouble? That's right. You had too. All right. You're both healed. All right. It went... God bless you. All right. Everyone be reverent. Be real reverent. Now, you see, it wants Satan to slip by with that then. The Spirit's moving every way now. It's coming right in. When that woman set down there, she also accepted Jesus for a better experience. Isn't that right, lady? If that's right, raise back up again. Well, the lady setting next to you there, is just feeling the Spirit hit her. You've been suffering with female... Have you--have you got...? You got a prayer card? You haven't got no prayer card? Stand up just a minute. Let's see, you haven't got a prayer card? All right. You had female trouble, didn't you? All right. Now, you go home; you're healed too. You can just go ahead home. All right. 52-0717, Get The People To Believe, Civic Center, Hammond, IN, 80 min Now, everyone, just a moment. Just reverent. Oh, what the Spirit of God can do right now, if you'll just be reverent. Oh, I--I must get back to praying for the sick though.

L-55 Come here just a minute. Now, I see when He goes to moving in... I can't hardly go without It moving me. See? Now--now, here stands a poor thing. Lady, you've had a world of trouble, haven't you? You're just a lady that's walked up there in a prayer line. That's all. You are a Christian. You're a... And that... Do you believe now that Jesus Christ will... No, sir. No, sir. You're suffering with a...?... condition. That's exactly right. You need Jesus Christ. Isn't that right? You need Him as your Saviour. I'm looking at that woman standing right back there. I was trying to catch right over your shoulder. Come up here just a little bit closer, so I'll be out, if you... Look, will you accept Him now as your Saviour, and believe that He will save your soul from sin, right now, and will make you well? Do you do that? Our heavenly Father, I pray for her. Through Jesus Christ's Name, I ask for her healing, and, Lord God, a healing of her soul. May she go from here tonight rejoicing, happy, and be made well through Jesus' Name. Amen. All right, come. [A brother speaks to Brother Branham--Ed.] All right. Yes, sir.

L-56 All right. The next twenty-five, can you come out now? From fifty. From... Just a minute, sister. From fifty... I mean from twenty-five up to fifty in "O," line right along in behind there...?... All right. All right. [The sister talks to Brother Branham--Ed.] No, not now. No, ma'am. You can go now and... Are you ready to serve God the rest of your life? Going to live for Him all your life? All right. Go right on now, and be made--be made whole. Now, ministers, you ought to get a hold of the woman right away. All right, sir. That... All right, sir. Now, let it go up to... first to twenty-five up to fifty now in "O," twenty-five to fifty. All right. Come... [Blank.spot.on.tape--Ed.]

L-57 Father, I ask in Jesus' Name for this man's healing. May he leave here tonight, Lord... And I, with all that I know how to pray the prayer of faith, I ask that You let him get well. Amen. God bless you, brother. Now, go re--rejoicing, believing. And let me hear from you tomorrow night. All right. Come now. O Father, I pray Thee in the Name of Thy Son, Jesus, that You heal the woman and make her well. As I lay hands upon her, I pray that You will make her every whit whole through Jesus Christ's Name. Amen. God bless you, sister. Now, go rejoicing. All right. Come, lady... [Blank.spot.on.tape--Ed.]... tonight, thanking and praising God before the Holy Spirit ever come. Is that right? They had the promise. Is that right? Well, we've got the promise. Amen. Just believe now. Come near, sister. Do you believe now with all your heart? O Father, I ask for this poor little woman, that You will heal her body. As Your Angel's standing near here, and I feel led to do these things... So Father, I pray that You'll heal her now. And I hope tomorrow night, Lord, that out of this great group of people that shall pass this platform tonight, that there'll be at least ninety percent of them healed. Grant it, Father. In Jesus Christ's Name, I ask for this woman's healing. Amen. Now, go rejoicing and happy, and saying, "Thank You, Lord," and you shall--you'll get--you'll get well.

L-58 All right. Come, sir. Do you believe with all your heart, sir? Do you believe if I'll ask Him, you'll get well? O Father, I pray as Your servant, the only way... We realize that--that prayer changes things. Prayer changes a sinner to a Christian. Prayer changes a sick man into a well man. And I ask, in joining prayer with this man that You heal his body. May he go off this platform happy, rejoicing, in Jesus' Name, be well. Amen. Now, let me hear from you tomorrow night, my brother. All right, sir. All right. Now, come and be reverent now. Do you believe with all your heart? You should. Yes, ma'am. Why'd you think I said that? Because you're a minister of the Word. Is that right? Suffering with a nervous condition, is that right? God, go home... I pray that You'll make this poor little woman well. And may she be happy the rest of her life serving You. Amen. Go rejoicing now, and be happy. All right now.

L-59 Do you believe with all your heart, as you come? 52-0717, Get The People To Believe, Civic Center, Hammond, IN, 80 min Father, I pray for her, that You'll heal her body. And as Your servant, I pray the prayer of faith all I know how. And You said, "Whatsoever things you desire, when you pray, believe you receive it and you shall have it. It'll be given to you." And I pray with all my heart. And how can the people doubt it any more when You're making Yourself known. Your great blessings are moving through this crowd. If there ever was a night of Pentecost, this is it. Here we are together, gathered together, the Holy Spirit, Jesus Christ moving around among the people. Oh, what a time. Bless this poor suffering child of Yours in Jesus' Name. Amen. God bless you, sister. Now, come rejoicing; come, believing. Do you believe, my brother? O Father, I ask You to heal his body. He comes up here sincerely, asking me to pray for him. He needs prayer. And Your Angel Who met me, said, "Pray for the sick. Get them to believe you, and they'll be well." Now, God, I pray that You'll grant it to this brother. May he leave this platform and get well in Jesus' Name. Amen. God bless you, brother. I believe you're going to receive it, don't you? Amen.

L-60 All right. Come, sir. God bless you, sir. Do you believe? You must believe now. You understand, don't you? Now, you know what I'm talking of. He's the great physician. That's right. And you're going to serve Him if He will let you live, 'cause only He can let you live now. Father, I pray that You will bless this poor man, seeing this hideous demon has taken his life right down. Now, he hasn't got much time left. But this is the time, like with the lepers that laid at the gate. They said, "Why set we here till we die? Let us get up and do something about it." May he rise tonight, and say, "Here I am in the Presence of the Almighty. I ask for my life." And may God stir for him, and heal his body, as I, Your servant, Lord, lay hands upon him, along with these other Christians, asking for his healing... And may this hideous demon of cancer come out of him in the Name of Jesus Christ. Amen. God bless you, sir. Go on your road. God... Go on praising His... Look, sir, you haven't got nothing to lose. You put your trust in Christ, confess your healing, go, believing. See?

L-61 All right. Come, sir. Do you believe now with all your heart? Do you believe that Christ is going to make you well? I can't heal you, my brother. But I can pray for you. Is that right? Do you believe He will make you well? I believe you believe that. Now, heavenly Father, as I stand here holding this young boy tonight, I'm thinking of way over there, how tens of thousands of them, of his people received You. And then my mind drifts on back a little farther, to one day coming, dragging down through Jerusalem an old rugged cross, dragging across the cobblestones. Look Who's packing it, a little crown on His head made of thorns, His back bleeding, striped. I see Him go yonder towards that little hill, looks like a skull. On His road out there, thieves walking by His side, packing the cross, big burly men... But He was little and thin. And His scourge, His little poor thin blood out, God, He was dying. O God, that old cross dragging out the bloody footprints. And there come Simon the Cyrene, an Ethiopian, come along and helped Him. Picked the cross up and pack it on up to Calvary. God, here's his children. You understand it. I pray for the healing of this boy with sincerity. May he go home and get well in Jesus' Name. Amen. God bless you, my son. Go now and find out tomorrow night what's... I want to hear what's happened. All right.

L-62 All right, come. Do you believe, sir? You should. All right, sir. Our heavenly Father, I ask for his healing. Grant, Lord, that Your blessings will be upon him, and he will go from here tonight and be healed, and preach the Gospel harder than he ever did in all of his life, in Jesus' Name. Amen. God bless you, my brother. All right, come. You don't want to go blind. You want to... [The sister talks to Brother Branham--Ed.] Now, you are. God bless you. That's take--that's the way to do it. She was healed standing right here, and walked off the platform. All right, sir. All right. You also had something wrong with your eyes, and you want to be healed. Is that right? Your eyes look nice and clear, but they're going blind. You've been... Always, you had to hold your book close, and things like that, to read. But now, something's happened. Go in the Name of the Lord Jesus. Believe with all your heart. 52-0717, Get The People To Believe, Civic Center, Hammond, IN, 80 min Do you believe, sir? O God, I pray that in the Name of Thy holy Son, Jesus, that You heal this young man. May he go off this platform tonight full of the Spirit of God, serving You all of his life with a good healthy body the rest of his days. Amen. God bless you, my brother. Go, and the peace of God upon you.

L-63 Poor dad, do you believe with all your heart? You do? God bless my brother and make him well. Father, I pray for him, somebody's dad. God, lay Your healing hands upon him and make him well. I pray in Jesus' Name. Amen. Amen. Now, brother, you go believing. And you'll be able to eat and not take that stuff one of these days, that'll...?... your stomach. God bless you. Now, come, lady, realizing that you must believe Christ or die. Isn't that right? The cancer would kill you. It's all... It'll--it'll do it certainly if you can't accept Him. But you believe it now, don't you? Father, I pray for this sister. It may be some baby's mother here, Lord. O God, be merciful. And may she go from here tonight rejoicing and happy as I curse that cancer in the Name of Jesus Christ. God bless you, sister. Go, believing, and may... All right.

L-64 Come, sir. You believe me as God's prophet, don't you? Do you believe that I... God sent me that I am now... And this feeling, that you know this Presence is the Spirit of God, don't you? Yes, sir. All right. Now, would you serve Him the rest of your days? If He will make you well, will you serve Him? You will? All right. Now, I want you to believe with all your heart. Our heavenly Father, I ask now that You will make this poor man, that Satan is trying to--to lay him up here in a wheelchair, on a bed, and break down his feet and his hands, and--and callous... or make the bones run together. I pray, God, that in Jesus' Name that You'll stay that, and may he get well through Jesus Christ's Name. Amen. Now, brother, if you'll believe with all your heart, you'll never be bothered with arthritis no more. Just go and be as well as you can be. All right. Let's say, "Praise be to God."

L-65 All right, lady. Now, of course there's many things wrong with you. One thing, you're going blind, and your eye's are getting bad. Come here just a minute. Isn't that right now? That's right. That's right. Father, I pray that as now as Your Spirit's standing here, the anointing sweeping down over the building, how can people stand still? Lord, I pray that You'll heal this woman and make her well. And thou, blind spirit, leave her now in Jesus' Name. Amen. Now, sister, you have what you've asked for. Go and believe with all your heart and be made well. All right. Come, lady. Wasn't it strange that you all were together, wanting the same thing? Huh? God, I pray that in Jesus Christ's Name, that You'll grant to her her healing, also, Lord. May she go away from here and be perfectly normal and well through the Name of Thy Son, Jesus Christ. Amen. You... Let's say, "Praise the Lord," everybody. Praise Him from the...?... Now, that's wonderful.

L-66 Come, lady. Do you believe with all your heart? Do you believe that our Lord Jesus can make you well? And the only thing that... You believe I'll have to do is just ask Him? And if I ask Him then He will do it? Is that right? Do you believe it? All right. Now, I'm going to ask Him. Father, I pray that You heal the woman and make her well. May she leave from here tonight and go home and be well. In Jesus Christ's Name I bless her. And You said, "Whatever you bind on earth, I'll bind in heaven. Whatever you loose on earth, I'll loose in heaven." Then I... Father, I ask that You loose her from her infirmities in Jesus' Name. God bless you, sister. Go, believing with all your heart. Now, come, sister. Do you believe with all your heart? Come just a little nearer. I want to lay hands on you, to pray for you. Now, you believe if I'll ask God with all my heart to let you get well, you believe He will do it? Do you believe it with all your heart? You truly believe. All right. Now, do you believe all that nervousness will leave you? You do? Why, It's already done it. So now you can go on your road rejoicing. Say... All right. Let's say, "Praise be to God," everybody.

L-67 Now, sister... Oh, it's... Almighty God, Author of Life and Giver of every good gift, send Thy blessings upon this 52-0717, Get The People To Believe, Civic Center, Hammond, IN, 80 min woman who's standing here with this deaf spirit. Satan, you've done this evil thing to cause her to walk before a vehicle somewhere, and go to a premature grave. But you're defeated. I come as God's servant, a joining with the rest of these Christians here tonight. And I adjure thee, by Jesus, the Son of God, come out of her. Do you believe now with all your heart? And do you love Him? With all your heart? And isn't He wonderful? Just... He--He--He's just glorious, isn't He? Do you love Him with...?... serve Him? And you believe that He's made you well? Then you're healed. Your hearing's back to you, hear normally. The old condition that's been bothering you, female troubles, is gone. Now, you can go off the platform. Say, "Thank You, Lord," and be made well.

L-68 All right. Strange, this woman's deaf, also. Come here. Satan, thou demon, we as Christians say, "Come out from the woman. Leave her." Through Jesus' Name, leave her. All right. Do you love Him with all your heart? Oh, you do? Well, that's wonderful. Huh? [The sister speaks to Brother Branham in several places in this quote--Ed.] You--you have that, also? Yeah, how long? How long have you been in this condition? Some time. Just isn't it wonderful that the Lord Jesus has...? Isn't that awful? Yes. And now, when you was back yonder years ago, as a young woman out there teaching those children, and so forth, in that school, and--and got to a place till you couldn't hear, and so forth like that... And now, think, even in this age, that the Lord Jesus has restored your hearing to you. Isn't that wonderful? Now, raise your hands, and say, "Thank You, Lord." That's... God bless you.

How many sick along here, let's see your hands, all along there? All right. Let's try having that first bleacher row on the bottom, to come over this a way just a minute. Just... That's it. There you all raise up there at the row and come over this way. And then maybe I can take some from back out in here. And I'll try to get... [A brother speaks to Brother Branham--Ed.] What say? Yes, bring them right over this a way and let me pray for them.
