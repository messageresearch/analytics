--- TRANSCRIPT ---

L-1 ... be the Word. Remember tomorrow afternoon, [Blank.spot.on.tape--Ed.] That right. But you know where I mean, it's about fifty miles up the road.

L-2 In the Book of Exodus, we read, tonight, from the--the 12th chapter of Exodus, and the 12th verse and the 13th verse. I believe it would be nice if we stood while we read the Word, in respects to God. Exodus 12:12. For I will pass through the land of Egypt this night, and I will smite all the firstborn in the land of Egypt, both man and beast; and against all the gods of Egypt I will execute judgment: I am the LORD. And the blood shall be unto you for a token upon the house where you are: and when I see the blood, I will pass over you, and the plague shall not be upon you to destroy you, when I smite the land of Egypt. [Exodus 12:12-13]

L-3 Let us bow our heads.

L-4 Father God, we pray, tonight, that we'll examine ourself and see if the Blood is sufficiently, and in sight. As we speak on Thy Word, may the Holy Spirit guide us, in Jesus' Name. Amen. You may be seated.

L-5 Our Scripture reading, tonight, takes us back in Exodus. Exodus is an "outgoing." And, this, we're all acquainted with the--the time, and for the context. I'm going to take the subject of: The Token. A token, what is a token? A token is a sign of a... that a price has been paid.

L-6 Like a railroad company, or a bus fare. When they run a bus line, you go in, many of the cities still have it. You can, or a ticket is a token. If you go to a railroad company, and, or an airplane company, and buy a ticket, it isn't the money that you give in when you go, it's the token, your ticket, or your little token that you have. Shows that you have purchased a required price. They require a certain price, and this price has been paid.

L-7 And the subject we're speaking on, tonight, God's requirement for Israel, requirement of Jehovah, was the blood of a lamb. That was His requirement, and it was to be for a token. The token showed that the requirement had been met, that what God had required had been met.

L-8 What the railroad requires, the token shows it's been met. Your fare is paid. You're ready to get on the train, plane, bus, whatever it is, but you must have the token. You can't go on without the token. Many of the companies will not receive your cash, when you go out to the airplane, walk out there, and say, "I want to pay my ticket." You go get your ticket first. You must have the ticket, and just the token is what you must hold. The money, itself, will not work. You must have the token.

L-9 The life was gone out from the sacrifice, and now the blood was the token. His orders had been carried out.

L-10 That's what it was in Egypt, that dreadful night, just before death struck, the last plague. God had showed His great signs and wonders in Egypt, His long-suffering and kindness, to Pharaoh and all of his people. He had sent many great signs through the land. He sent them a prophet, showed them signs and wonders, the Pillar of Fire, and all that He had did. And yet, all that He had did, yet they would not repent. They would not come to God. They ignored all of His signs. They ignored His prophet. They ignored the message. They wanted their own way. So God had been fed up with them, so He said, "I'm going to make a separation now between those who do believe and those who do not believe." [Exodus 12:1-14]

L-11 I think we're living in that time now, where God is making a choice. Man will believe or they won't believe.

L-12 And God required a token, and this token was an innocent lamb that He had substituted for death, in the garden of Eden. And now when the lamb was killed, the blood was to be placed upon the doorpost and on the lintel, and it was to show that the requirement had been carried out. [Exodus 12:7] 64-0208, The Token, Kern County Fairgrounds, Bakersfield, CA, 80 min

L-13 Oh, I think that's a great lesson for us as we look at it. See the believing, worship, as he was identified by the token of the blood. He had to, the believer had to get the lamb, slay the lamb, a lamb for a house, take the blood with hyssop, which is just a little brush that grows up there in the country. And they, common weeds, we would call it, and had to apply the blood. It shows, by the applying of the blood, with this hyssop, hyssop represents faith. Many time, people think they have to have some supernatural faith, to be a believer. It isn't. The hyssop speaks for that, just common weeds that you could get it anywhere, pick it up, dip it in the blood, and apply the blood. [Exodus 12:22]

L-14 The Blood, tonight, is applied by simple faith. Just not nothing supernatural; it's right around you, everywhere. Just simply, like a child, reach out and get a hold of it, and apply the Blood. The hyssop is just a simple child-like faith, for the believer. It isn't something out of your reach. You don't have to reach very far to get it. [Ephesians 2:8]

L-15 This hyssop that grows in that country, it grows out of the cracks of the walls, a little kind of a diamond-shaped leaf. You can pick it up, anywhere. Just as--as grass or weeds would be in--the--in the country here now; just pick it up, apply it, put it on the door. [Psalms 51:7]

L-16 That's the way faith is to be applied; take faith, rather, and apply the Blood of Jesus Christ, by faith, to the heart's door. [Ephesians 2:8]

L-17 This was going to separate and make the difference between those who were going out of Egypt, and those who were going to stay in Egypt, and perish with Egypt. It made the difference.

L-18 Strange, how God always works through signs, signals, tokens, and so forth. He always has done it. That's His way of doing anything. He never does it outside of that. God never makes a move until He does it in that way.

L-19 The way God starts, that's the way God finishes. He is infinite, omnipotent, omnipresent, omniscient. He needs nobody's help. He doesn't need our interpretation, as I said last night. He doesn't need us to interpret the Word and say what It means. He speaks what It says It'll do, that's the interpretation. Nobody has to interpret It. When God says, "Let it be," and it is, that's His interpretation of It. [Genesis 1:3, 6, 9, 14, 20]

L-20 We might say, "The days of miracles has passed. There is no such a thing as the baptism of the Holy Spirit." The man who believes It, God speaks to him, and that's the interpretation. They got it! That's, they know they have It, because God gives His Own interpretation to His Word.

L-21 That's what He was requiring that night, to separate the believers from the unbelievers. The believer, worshiper, was identified with his sacrifice. He must apply the blood. It wasn't "take and kill the lamb, set the blood out there somewhere, or keep it in a charger, or take it down to the neighbors." He had to apply the blood!

L-22 That's the way it is, tonight. We could come and sympathize with everything God does, that isn't what He requires. You've got to apply it. It's not sufficient until you apply it. The Blood must be applied, that shows that you are identified. The worshiper laid his hand upon the lamb and then killed it, identify himself with the sacrifice.

L-23 The same thing we do, tonight, is lay our hand upon our Sacrifice, and identify ourself with Him. And He is the Word. We have to be identified only through Christ, is when we're identified by the Word, because He is the Word, always has been. "In the beginning was the Word, the Word was with God, and the Word was God. And the Word was made flesh and dwelt among us. The same yesterday, today, and forever!" [John 1:1, 14], [Hebrews 13:8]

L-24 So much Word is lotted to each generation. God sends someone in there and identifies that Word, by His interpretation of Himself.

L-25 Creeds and things has always had the church in such a turmoil, everybody said, "Well, this is the way, and this is the way, and this is what you must do." But God comes in, and steps on the scene and makes what He said come to pass, that's the interpretation. Needs nobody to tell; not sinful man, or organizations, or any great big denomination, or anything else, to interpret the Word; some bishop, archbishop, pope, or something. That isn't it. God does His Own interpreting. When He promised it, He does it. [II Peter 1:20]

L-26 As I've said, many times. When He said, "Let there be light," and there was light, that's the interpretation. It doesn't need any more, anything else to try to interpret It. God interprets, Itself. [Genesis 1:3] 64-0208, The Token, Kern County Fairgrounds, Bakersfield, CA, 80 min

L-27 This blood being applied, and identified worshiper identified himself with the blood, by applying it in his own house, over the door, where he could not go out or come in without being recognized by the blood. A very perfect type, of today, of the Blood of Jesus Christ. Then, the blood was a token of identification. Christ is the token of the identification of a believer today. [Ephesians 1:7]

L-28 Animal life. Them days, the reason they had to apply the chemical blood, take it upon hyssop, place it upon the doorpost and the lentil, is because the animal... The worshiper that put his hands and identified himself with the animal, the life that was in the animal could not return back upon the worshiper, because the animal doesn't have a soul. He doesn't better hisself at all. [Exodus 12:7]

L-29 We find out, today, that we man, although fallen, in this fallen state, we build our houses better, we built, build a better car. We take what God has created, pervert it, and turn it into something to help ourself. It goes to show that we are sons of God, in our fallen estate, yet we have a soul. We cannot create, like God did. But we can take what He created, and make a similar creation out of what He has already created.

L-30 An animal doesn't do that. The dog still lives the same way He lived. The bird still builds a nest. And the fish has its spawning grounds. There is no difference there, because (why?) they doesn't... don't have a soul. But, proves that man is in the image of his creator. Therefore, that when the animal died and the blood was broken, the cell was broken, the life is in the blood cell. And when the blood cell was broken, the blood broken up, the worshiper had to take the chemistry of the blood and put it upon the door, so it could be seen with the literal eye. Because, the life that was in the animal could not come back upon the man, not having a soul, therefore it wouldn't mix with the soul of a man. An animal's life won't come back upon the human being. [Hebrews 9:12]

L-31 Now, our Sacrifice today, not only an ordinary human being, but it was God Himself that was identified in flesh here upon the earth. When that Blood cell was broke, not only did the soul of a Man, or a spirit of a Man; but God Himself, Who was identified in that Man, returns back upon the believer, in the baptism of the Holy Spirit. That's the Token that God requires today. The Token of today, that we have to have, must be the Holy Spirit. That's God's required Token. We'll prove it to you by the Scriptures.

L-32 Without the Holy Spirit, you do not display the Token. That's the Token, shows that the... that you have identified yourself with the Sacrifice, and God has sent you back the Token, to show that you've been accepted. Until that's done, no matter how good you are, how much you know, how a college professor, a good person, preacher, whatever it might be. You are absolutely not recognized until you can show the Token.

L-33 Israel, in that exodus, as they come out that time, they had to have the token, to prove that they was identified with their sacrifice.

L-34 And, tonight, God requires the baptism of the Holy Ghost, for a proof that we've been identified in the resurrection of Jesus Christ. There is nothing short of it. The Bible teaches it, plain, and we must believe it. It's God's Word. God is requiring it. We're having an exodus, again. We all know that. Israel was marching to the promised land, so will the Bride go to her Home, pretty soon.

L-35 Now we find out, the blood was a token, and--and was identified. Everyone was identified by the blood.

L-36 The Holy Ghost is our Token, today, to identify us by, with Jesus Christ, in His resurrection. The Blood being applied by faith.

L-37 The chemistry of the Blood could not sprinkle every heart, we know that, because it was shed on Calvary. It bathed the ground. But out, when that Blood cell was broke, it released God, through the sanctifying power that the Blood had, to come back to believers.

L-38 God, in the beginning, was God, the Father, Who lived above all.

L-39 Just like the--the Pillar of Fire that led the children of Israel through the wilderness, He come down upon the mountain. If anybody touched the mountain, because, he must be killed. God is holy, and He cannot condone sin in no manner. And the man that touched that mountain died, even a beast had to be thrust through. When God came down, 64-0208, The Token, Kern County Fairgrounds, Bakersfield, CA, 80 min He was holy. [Exodus 19:12-13]

L-40 Then God, condescending, come down and was made in the form of a Man, that we could "handle Him, touch Him," the Bible said. In that teeny little Blood cell!

L-41 Many Jews wants to say He was a Jew. Many of us wants to say He was a Jew. He was neither Jew nor Gentile. He was God. He was the creative Being, by the hand of almighty God. He created the tabernacle He lived in, which we know as the Son of God. That's right. The deity, supreme deity of Jesus Christ, 'cause God dwelt in Him. [Colossians 2:9]

L-42 Peter said, "Ye men of Israel; Jesus of Nazareth, a Man made known by God, by signs and wonders, you've took with wicked hands and crucified Him. We were witnesses of His resurrection," when the Holy Ghost had been poured out upon them. [Acts 2:22]

L-43 Now we find out, that in this great thing, that, as God was identifying Himself with Israel back there, and requiring that identification.

L-44 Now we find out here, the Jews could say, they might say, "Well, now, wait just a minute. I am a... I'm a Jew. I'm--I'm in the covenant of Abraham. I'm circumcised." The covenant had, was annulled, if the token wasn't displayed. Think of that! I'm talking of a Token of this day. If that blood wasn't displayed, that token, I don't care how much you could show you was a Jew, how much you said you believed. You might have been rabbi, priest, or anything, but that token had to be applied. No in's or out, yes or no; until He saw the blood, He would pass over.

L-45 Some fellows might say, "Come aside here. I can prove I was circumcised at eight days. The priest has record of it. My name is on the book up there." That didn't one thing to do with it. The--the token was the... If the token was not applied, the covenant was annulled. It was of none effect.

L-46 We must remember that what God says. He never takes back, but He adds to. "Them of old time, you hear them say, 'Thou shall not commit adultery,' but I say unto you, that whosoever looketh upon a woman to lust after her, hath committed adultery with her already." He never takes back; He adds to. He magnifies. That's what He does. All of His works, He continually magnifies them.

L-47 That's where we're walking from one church age, from Luther, into Wesley, into Pentecost, and on and on as we go. As we move on up, God continually magnifies the same Word, just keep it going like that, until finally the church will come into the image of Jesus Christ, which will be His Bride that He'll take Home, right, the thing that we're looking for today. Sure, we realize that the church will go through the tribulation, but the Bride won't. She'll be taken out from the church, just as--as Israel was taken out of Egypt. We find out now that the Holy Spirit was the One now that identifies us with Jesus Christ. [Matthew 5:27-28]

L-48 The Jews might say, "Yes, we are covenant Jews." But if they did not have the token, the covenant was of no effect.

L-49 The same thing now. No matter how good we are, no matter... You might say, "Well, I'm... I've did this, and I've did all these things. And I've paid my tithes. I've belonged to the church, and I do all this." God requires the Token, show that you have been identified with your Sacrifice, the One that you claim to have, the One that you believe that you have.

L-50 Peter said, "Repent, every one of you, and be baptized in the Name of Jesus Christ for the remission of sins, and you shall receive the gift of the Holy Ghost. For the promise is unto you and to your children, and to them that's far off, as even as many as the Lord our God shall call." [Acts 2:38-39]

L-51 Who is that sinful man that will change That, and say, "The days of miracles is past"? Who will do that, and say that God's Word was wrong?

L-52 When He said, "Whosoever calls upon the Name of the Lord! For the promise is unto you, and to your children, and to them that's far off, even as many as the Lord our God shall call." He'll stamp the Token upon them. [Acts 2:38-39]

L-53 That's makes the difference between the believer and the unbeliever. There was those sealed by the Kingdom of 64-0208, The Token, Kern County Fairgrounds, Bakersfield, CA, 80 min God, and those marked by the mark of the beast, and the ones that was marked by the mark of the beast could not take the Seal of God. The same thing is coming in today, and we see it right before our own eyes.

L-54 No matter how good you are, how much you say you're a believer, God required the Token. He required it in Egypt. He requires it tonight. He requires it tonight. Still, the Token is just as much required in this age as it was in that age. I don't care if you was a Bible student, how well you can explain the Scriptures; Satan can do the same thing. But, remember, that has nothing to do with it. God requires one thing, that's the Token. The Token shows that you are identified with your Sacrifice that you claim that you worship. Amen. That's it. "When I see the blood," or the token, "the blood shall be a token; and I see the blood, I'll pass over you." [Exodus 12:13]

L-55 Death was ready to strike Egypt then, at any time. It was a great, tremendous time. God had showed them grace, by showing His power, signs. Still they desired not to repent, and not turn back. They didn't want anything like that. They didn't believe it. They didn't believe the message that was going on. God had sent them a message; they didn't believe it. They still wanted to go right on the way they did. [Exodus 12:1-12]

L-56 Just a perfect type of today, same thing. Every spiritual happening and every spiritual sign is a warning from God, that something is fixing to take place, if that sign comes from God. If it's man-made, there's--there's nothing to it. But if it's God-sent! Anyone knows, everyone knows, that God sends a sign, if it's a supernatural sign, He sends a Message with that sign. Always does, He never fails to do that. We see things that's not signs of God, well, then it won't be nothing, 'cause God isn't in it. But when God is in it, a Message is going to follow that, and that Message must be from the Scripture. That must be a Scriptural Message. It must come THUS SAITH THE LORD. Every spiritual happening is a sign from God. [Exodus 12:1-13]

L-57 Like the Message and the signs a following, in this day, like it was in the days of other days that we passed through, in the Bible time. And no other time could this ever be till now. No other time could this Message ever come forth till now. Jesus said, "As it was in the days of Sodom, so shall it be in the coming of the Son of man." The Message could not be till now. The world wasn't in the condition as until it's in now. This is the hour that Jesus could appear at any time. [Luke 17:27-28]

L-58 The sleeping virgin coming in, trying to buy Oil. That is at that time when the Bride went in, and the rest of them was left here. Did you ever think what happened? They went right ahead preaching and thinking they were getting souls saved, and everything, and did not know it. They knew nothing about it. The church will go on, thinking souls are being saved, and everything else, and the Church is already (the Bride) sealed away. Don't know it! Certainly. That's exactly what the Scripture said. Noah went into the ark, and God sealed it out. Truly. And the time will come when men and women will cry to God, and even think that they've got something, when they haven't. That's exactly right. The Scripture speaks that. [Matthew 25:9-10]

L-59 Likewise, we must remember that God is "long-suffering, not willing that any should perish." He always sends His signs, His wonders. And then when He gets ready to do anything, He separates the believer from the unbeliever. [II Peter 3:9]

L-60 Notice, then, how He provide for His promised-land people. Look what He did for His promised-land people there, to be sure that they would not be mixed up in some kind of an ism. What did He do? He sent a prophet to them, Moses, with a message, identifying God's Word. And, to identify Moses, He sent a Pillar of Fire that hung over him. Amen. Then, to give them a perfect assurance, He's required a token. Amen. There is the messenger, the message, and the vindication, and the token, the perfect assurance that they had nothing to worry about. No matter how many plagues strike, what everybody else says, they are sealed away.

L-61 Israel coming out of Egypt, as I said a few minutes ago, is a type of the Bride coming out of the church. When Moses begin his ministry, Israel gathered together in one place, in Goshen, begin to pray; because they knowed that the hour was at hand, because they knew something was there. The deliverer had already come. God was working, doing things, showing what He was going to do. They come from all parts of Egypt, just like they will at the day of His Coming. They'll take people out of the Methodist, Baptist, Lutheran. All those who are identified in Christ, by the 64-0208, The Token, Kern County Fairgrounds, Bakersfield, CA, 80 min Token, God will take them with Him when He comes.

L-62 We read over here in Hebrews, the 10th chapter, 26th verse, "If we sin wilfully after we have received the knowledge of the Truth, there remaineth no more Sacrifice for sin, but a fearful, dreadful looking for the fiery judgments which will devour the adversary." That is, if we disbelieve wilfully after we have a knowledge of the Truth, there is no more Sacrifice for sin." Think of it! No matter what you're thinking in your heart, the Token can never be applied; if you reject It the last time, then it cannot be applied. "He, for he that sins or disbelieves wilfully."

L-63 As we see the great end signs, and times a coming, as we are now with a promise of the Word! Every Word that's been promised to us before the end time, we are laying right in it now. Even to the marking of the beast, and the denominations getting together, and--and the papal reign coming in, and everything just exactly the way it is. The world is hanging yonder, the atom bombs is in the hangers. And God is speaking through His servants, into the churches, and pulling them out, and showing the signs that He promised He would do just before His Coming. We're at the end time. The Token is required. Yes, sir. Now we know that those things are true. As they was, they were only a type of what we're going through now. As we see these great signs coming at the end time, warning us, the time is at hand.

L-64 Don't sin wilfully. Don't disobey wilfully. If there is something in you, that say, "Well, now, I don't see where I need the Holy Ghost. I might not need It. I believe, when I believed, I got It."

L-65 Paul said, to the people that asked that question, he said, "Have you received the Holy Ghost since you have believed?" [Acts 19:2]

L-66 The Holy Ghost is the Token. A man believes God, that is true enough. But the Holy Ghost is a gift of God, it's something different than your faith. Your faith applies it, that's exactly right, but the Holy Ghost is the witness. We'll see, just in a few minutes, how It works, and what takes place, where we can be sure, where we know where we're right, or not. It warns us that the time is at hand.

L-67 We should love one another. During this time, the church and the believer should be unseparable. Believers, believers should separate themselves from all the things of the world. Everything that's ungodly, the believer should separate himself from it. [I John 2:15]

L-68 Notice, they were not just to come together to talk about it, and say, "We believe it." They were come together to apply the blood. Not come, say, "Oh, sure, I believe that," walk home. They had to come and apply the blood, that the token might be seen; get beneath it.

L-69 That's today. We sit and hear the Message preached. We read It out of the Bible. We say, "Oh, yes, I believe That." That ain't what God requires. No matter how much you believe It, you've got to have It. Church, wake up!

L-70 America, this is your last hour! Judgment lays in the balance, yonder, for this nation. If God would let this nation get by with what it's done now, He would be obligated to raise up Sodom and Gommorah, and apologize for burning them up. That's right. We are going to pay for our sins. We are doing the same thing they did in Sodom.

L-71 And God has sent down Message just exactly the way He did in Sodom. Just exactly. He sent one to the church out there and the Lot group; and to Sodom; and He sent to the Elect, and so forth. And proved it, that the church is setting exactly in the condition it was in the days of--of Lot, as Jesus said it would be again. Friends, it's on our hands, what are we going to do with it? Say, "Blood on your hands?" Yes. [Luke 17:26-30]

L-72 What do you think Oswald thought when he was sitting in that room, the other day, by taking the blood of his fellow man, shooting the President in assassination? And he was sitting there, knowed he had to face that federal court, when that Supreme Court would look on him, with angry eyes, knowing that on his hands was the blood of the President of the United States. He was in a sweatbox.

L-73 What ought it to do to a man, when you know you have trampled over the Blood of Jesus Christ, and refused to do it? Sitting in a sweatbox. Not only will you be judged by a Supreme Court; by an angry God that can cast the body 64-0208, The Token, Kern County Fairgrounds, Bakersfield, CA, 80 min away, and throw the soul into hell. You stop! Look! Listen! Take heed! We just trample over Him, easy, and think He is so loving.

L-74 A young fellow said, the other day, "God loves me so well!"

L-75 God is a good God, that is true, but He is a God of anger, too. He's a God of judgment. He's a God of wrath. We fail to get that. You make Him so good till you make Him some old dotty grandpa. He's not no dotty grandfather. He is almighty God, and He don't have no grandchildren. He has sons and daughters of God, not shook hands and adopted in. You must be born again, and the Blood applied! It's sons and daughters of God. Not some old soft grandfather, let His kids get by, grandchildren get by with anything. He is not a grandfather. He's a Father. Yes, sir. Every child must be born of Him. He's a Father of correction.

L-76 We know that this hour is here, and judgments is at hand. What are we going to do with It? I'd hate to have His Blood upon me. There is only one way you could ever get It off of you.

L-77 You can't wash It off. Pilate tried that. He tried to pass the buck on to somebody else, and said, "Send Him on over to a Caesar, or someone else like that, and see what he does." It backfired. It fell right back in his lap again. Right! [Matthew 27:24]

L-78 And, today, we try to say, "I would, if my husband! Yea, I would, if my wife! I would, if my church!" Backfires, right back on you again. When you say, "Oh, well, my church believes this." But when Jesus Christ comes down in these meetings and identifies Himself in the Scripture, that He's the same yesterday, today, and forever; I don't care what your interpretation is, It backfires right in your lap, and It's on your hands. Not a thing, brothers and sisters, you can do.

L-79 Friends, remember this, you of California, you're at the end of the West Coast here. And civilization has traveled with it, and all the riff-raff is blowing in. And, the next thing, It'll go to Israel when the Church is taken up. Take warning! There is only one way you can get the Blood of Jesus Christ off your hands, is put It in your heart. Only one way. It'll never work no other way. Said, "When I see the Blood, when it's applied in the right place!" "Well," you say, "I believe the Blood."

L-80 What if they had throwed it out in the back yard? What if they had put in on the chicken house? What if they had throwed it on the garage? No. It had to be applied at one certain place, that was on the lintel.

L-81 In the heart, that's where God wants the Blood, today. Not on your hands, but on your heart, God wants It.

L-82 And It's on your hands, today. If you haven't accepted Him, and got the Seal in your heart, It's on your hands. His identification of His Scripture, in this last days, puts It right back on our hands. What can we do with this Jesus that's called Christ? What are we going to do with It? Only one thing, is display His Blood, by letting It be on our heart, by the Holy Ghost. [Matthew 27:22]

L-83 We, responsible. Any of us that's not beneath that Blood, God is not responsible for it, not even one.

L-84 All the whole family had to come, not just one member. Say, "Well, if dad is a good man, he's a preacher, I'll be saved." No, sir. Your godly father and mother has nothing to do with you. You're an individual.

L-85 "I belong to the holy church, that church." The church has nothing to do with You.

L-86 There is no such a thing as a holy church. There is no such a thing as a holy person. There is a Holy Ghost with the people. The Holy Ghost in the church. No holy mountains, no holy places; It's a holy God. Not you being holy, me being holy; it's He is the One that's holy.

L-87 We are responsible to Him, not to a church. We are responsible to God and to His Word, and God is the Word. The Bible said He was. We're responsible to That. That's Jesus Christ.

L-88 Notice what He did then. We find out that the whole family only was safe when the token was displayed. When the token was displayed, they were safe.

L-89 Look in the 2nd chapter of Joshua, find out here that a believing harlot, by the name of Rahab, a Gentile harlot, 64-0208, The Token, Kern County Fairgrounds, Bakersfield, CA, 80 min over across the river, when they come into the promised land, the spies went over to spy out. All of her family was saved under the token, that only. Remember, God's destroying angel honored that token. When the churches went down, the mayor fell, the city went down, the king went down, the governor, the educated, the pretty women, the handsome man, the important, the all-sufficients, and everything went down that wasn't under that token. Amen. [Joshua 2:12-13]

L-90 So will it be in the Coming of the Son of God, His destroying angel will destroy everything who hasn't got the Token of the baptism of the Holy Ghost upon them, to show that you've been identified, and died, yourself, to your Sacrifice, and are born into the Spirit of God, and sealed there by the Holy Ghost. Only one God, and He is the only One that speaks the right Word, and This is It. None other can take anything from It. Notice.

L-91 Jericho had heard what God was doing. Jericho had heard the word. You remember what the harlot said, "We have heard how God did great things. I fear. Will you just spare me if I'll show kindness to you?" Jos-... [Joshua 2:10-13]

L-92 And Caleb and--and--and Joshua had told them what to do, how to apply this scarlet cord, and stay under it. "We're not responsible for one person!"

L-93 Said, "Can I bring my father in? Can I bring my mother? Can I bring my brothers, my sisters, my neighbors?" "Bring all that you can get under it."

L-94 That is the same today, brother. It isn't, "can we bring Methodists? Can we bring Baptists? Can we bring Pentecostals?" All that's ready to come under It, God will accept you. But That, and That alone, will only identify you with Him. Notice. Yes.

L-95 His great powers and signs that He had done down there, and they seen it and knowed. Why can't we have women and man, today, just as honest as that woman was, when we see what God promised to do and see Him doing it? Then, next thing, come judgment.

L-96 They must believed they were--they were... They believed, they must have believed they were safe in that great wall where were, where they were at, their great big family, their great big place. Many people today...

L-97 I say this, through reverence and respect. Many people, today, say, "I belong to the biggest church there is in the city. My mother belonged to that church. It's one of the oldest churches." That don't have one thing to do with it. The--the Token has got to be applied!

L-98 They might have thought, that big thing they lived in, that big system, that was going to save them. But we find out, everything that didn't show that token, perished, in the city. So will it be at the coming of the Son of man; He has done said so.

L-99 There must have been some of them tape boys, or somebody, slipped into the place down there and played some tapes to them, or something another, and found the predestinated. She took all of her house, and used it for a church, and received the messengers.

L-100 Then when they got all, in the city, that would come under it and believe the token, when she got all of it in there, then the destruction come. When God's wrath destroyed that big system they had down there, the token sign held her house safe. The token sign, not nothing else.

L-101 No matter how much societies, and how many good Red Cross things they had, which is all good, how much of this, and how many charity organizations, everything perished that wasn't under that token. Now think of it, everything perished! I don't care how big a church they had, how big a denomination they belonged to, was the king's palace; everything perished.

L-102 And so did everything perish in Egypt, that wasn't under that token.

L-103 Now, God doesn't change His ways. He's got a Token today. My brother, sister, you had better receive It. You better have It. Just remember, it's a warning.

L-104 Look, the same life that the token did, and--and same thing that the--the token did in Egypt, it spared everything that was under. Everything without it perished. 64-0208, The Token, Kern County Fairgrounds, Bakersfield, CA, 80 min

L-105 Joshua is a type of Jesus. Which, Joshua means "Jehovah-Saviour," so does Jesus mean "Jehovah-Saviour." Joshua was true to the Token sign that his messengers had preached. So will Jesus be true to the token sign that His messengers preached, when He comes. All under it was saved, in Egypt. All under it was saved, in Jericho. What about today? We find out, the lamb's blood was a type of Jesus Christ. All right.

L-106 In Hebrews 13, we find this, it is called there, "The everlasting covenant." God had a covenant with them. But the Blood now is an everlasting covenant, the Blood of Jesus Christ. [Hebrews 13:20]

L-107 God's Blood-bound promises makes us free from sin and self, makes us free from anything of the world. No matter how much we try to fashion it, the world, it's all dead. If we're in God's Blood-bound promises, we see nothing but the Blood. How could they look out that door without seeing the blood? How can you look out at anything without seeing first the Blood of Jesus Christ? If you're in Christ, you see That, to worship Him and to show forth His promises in power. He promised these things to come. His Blood-bound people are in Him, sealed in There by the Holy Spirit, and are looking only at the Blood and the promise. They can't look at the world. They're dead to the world, and the world is dead to them.

L-108 And to see Christians, today, who can do anything that the rest of the world does, act like them, swear like them, drink like them, smoke like them, and root in the pig pens of sin, and dance halls, and things like them, and then still say they are Christians? You can't do that, friend. That's the reason people can't believe the Power of God, they can't believe the signs and wonders, they done died to those Things and are--are resurrected over yonder in the world. But those who are dead to the world, are raised in Christ and are looking for His promise.

L-109 The New Testament means "New Covenant." The Blood Life, the Blood Life Itself, is the Token. The Life out of the Blood is the Token. Remember, in the Old Testament, the actual blood of the lamb had to be applied. Here, it's the Token of the Blood; it is the Life from the Blood, that's in the person, for the Token. Oh, my!

L-110 The new Token is the new Life that comes through Jesus Christ, when His Blood was shed, to sanctify a Church and fill It with His Presence, that He might manifest His Word and His promises to the people.

L-111 "God, in sundry times and divers manners," Hebrew 1, said, "He spoke to the fathers through the prophets, but in this last day through His Son, Jesus Christ." What is His Son? The Word. "The Word was made flesh and dwelt among us." And This is the Revelation, the completeness of Christ. "Whoever will add one word to It, or take One from It, the same will be taken, his part, out of the Book of Life." There is the Revelation. We only need the Token with us to make that Word live again. That's what He sent the Token for. It give us the statement, give us that statement, and we know it's the Truth. [Hebrews 1:1-2], [John 1:14], [Revelation 22:19]

L-112 The new Token shows Jesus has met every requirement for us, and He is here, the new Token. The Token of the Holy Spirit shows that we know that Jesus died to free us from all the things of the world, and the Token that is upon us proves it by vindicating what He said. [II Corinthians 5:15]

L-113 Now how can a man claim to hold that Token in front of him, and deny what this Word says? It isn't so. It can't be so. God can't lie about His Own Word.

L-114 And because He is here, we have the--the right to all that He purchased for us. Notice, what was the Token to do? To purchase. It's the price that's been paid. When you have the Token, you have a right then to present that Token, to anything that He purchased for you. And no one can buy it without It. It's only can be purchased by the Token.

L-115 Remember, if you went out here to the bus line, say, "Here, I tell you, I got a--I got a token that says another bus line." That won't work. "I got a token that says, come from Maine, from New Hampshire." It won't work in California. You've got to have the token of that bus line, in order to purchase. It shows that you have purchased that fare on that bus.

L-116 And when we can display the Token of the Holy Spirit, shows that we have been accepted in Christ, and that is our Token that all that we have need of is already purchased by Him. We are identified with our Token. The Token must be ready. 64-0208, The Token, Kern County Fairgrounds, Bakersfield, CA, 80 min

L-117 The Blood, Covenant Blood, is not recognized without the Token. The Word assures us of the promise. The Token is the sign the purchase has been made for us.

L-118 Full obedience to the full Word of God entitles us to the Token. No other way is there, that you could ever be entitled to the Token, until you fully obey the Word. Not what somebody has put into It, and added to It; but what God said about It!

L-119 When He said, "You must be born again." That don't mean jump up-and-down at the altar; that don't mean walk back there and shake hands with the pastor; that don't mean all this foolishness that we've seen done; it don't mean putting your name on a church book. It means death to your first being, and Life to the second being. It means that the Blood has been applied, and you're identified by the Life of Jesus Christ. And if He be the Vine, and we be the branches, the Life that's in the branch is in also from the Vine. It'll bear the fruit. [John 15:5], [John 3:3, 7]

L-120 If that first branch come forth, that branch out of that Vine, that wrote a book of Acts behind it; if that branch ever puts forth, a Vine puts forth another branch, they'll write another book of Acts behind it, 'cause it's the same Life. If a one of your grapevines out here brings forth blue grapes, if it puts forth another branch, it'll bring forth blue grapes. [John 15:5]

L-121 And I tell you, today, we got so many grafted vines into It, with denominations and creeds and things, and yet any citrus fruit grafted in can live, live in that Vine. But it's bearing the wrong fruit.

L-122 What we need, today, is another baptism of the Holy Spirit, and have the real Power of God that identifies the works that Jesus Christ promised for this day, not so much as that day. This day, the promise that He made here. That was what He promised there, He would pour out His Spirit. Now He has promised it again in the last days, and what He would do. [Joel 2:28]

L-123 Strange, that we can always look back, but you never look ahead. That's the way with man. He is always saying, glorifying God for what He did do, praising Him for what He is going to do, and ignoring what He is doing. That's always the way of man. It's still the same thing.

L-124 Full obedience to the Word brings God, the Word Eternal, in you, and that is the Token. When the Word is in you, It's Christ in you.

L-125 Now notice when, then, when we pray, if we have the Token. And when we pray, we have the Token, we... or present our Token with our prayer. Now, if you're sick, if you're a sinner, if you're in need, when you have the Token, you have a right. If I had the token to a bus line, in my hand, they can't keep me off of that bus; they've accepted my money, and I have the token. In this case, I could not pay my price, you could not pay it, but He paid it for us and give us the Token. Amen. I have a right to Divine healing; Jesus Christ died that I could have Divine healing. I have a right to claim every promise in that Book. When, when you get it? When you have the Token and can represent the Token with your prayer. If you haven't got It... The sign of the full obedience; the fare is paid. Paul tells us, "The Blood speaks."

L-126 "'Blood speaks,' did we say? Does the Blood speak? Can It speak? The Token speak?" Yes, sir.

L-127 If we'd--we'd look in Genesis 4:10, "the voice of the blood of Abel cried out against Cain." We find out, in Hebrews 12:24, that, "The Blood of Jesus Christ speaks better things." The Blood speaks! How can the chemistry speak? It's the Life, that's in the Blood, that does the speaking. The soul that was in Cain that cried out, it... or in Abel. It was the Life that was in Christ that cries out better things than any! It speaks, and It speaks loud. It's the Holy Spirit. It speaks plain, It tells us that the time is here. When we see it where It said it would say it, and then we see it come back and identify what It said, it's, there is nothing else left but to believe It, that's right, to receive It. [Genesis 4:10], [Hebrews 12:24]

L-128 Believe for self, and apply the Token also for the family, like they did in Egypt, and like they did at Jericho. Acts 16:31, we find out, Paul told the--the Roman to, "Be baptized, calling upon the Name of the Lord," him and his house could be saved by doing the same thing. [Acts 16:31] 64-0208, The Token, Kern County Fairgrounds, Bakersfield, CA, 80 min

L-129 Move out! Some people wants to apply the Blood and stay in. You apply the Blood and kick all the trash out of the house, and have a housecleaning time. You women take off them shorts. You man throw away them cigarettes; and you women, too. Get all this old stuff out of the system here, that's called the world. "If you love the world, or the things of the world, is because the love of God is not even in you." When you are ready to apply the Token, empty up and get ready for It. "You can't serve God and mammon at the same time." Women come along... [I John 2:15]

L-130 I've passed across this country. I've made remarks about Mrs. Kennedy, with her Jezebel haircut, and all like that, and her big waterheads, and these women. I wonder, if Mrs. Kennedy would have heard the Messages I have preached, she might have let her hair grow out, a long time ago. But I've crossed this country, back and forth, showing by the Word, that it's wrong, and a condemnation for women to cut their hair, and the Pentecostal women continue, go on the same way. She might rise in the day of Judgment, not knowing it, but you know better. It shows the Blood hasn't been applied. The Token is not there.

L-131 Long hair is a--a Nazarite vow. It showed that you've cut yourself from the world, to obey the Word. Amen. Samson let his hair grow out, for a Nazarite vow. Now we realizing these things. [Judges 13:5]

L-132 And women dressing and acting and doing, and man permitting them to do it, big bunch of sissies! It seems like there is not even man any more. You see man wearing pink shoes, and--and preachers on the pulpit, something like that. That's a disgrace. I like to see man again that's absolutely man. Looks like there's a power that drives them to do it, it's the devil and the pressure of this day. That's right. Sometime a man weighing two hundred pounds, and muscles like that, and not an ounce of man in him; acts like some big sissy out here. I like, let man be man. Let women be feminish, let them be ladies. When the Token is applied, they turn back to that. God made them different, and they are different. Man wants to look like women; women wants to look like man.

L-133 It goes to show there is a perversion, a dark spirit hanging over, gross darkness over the people. It's the hour of the calling out. There's a darkness over Egypt, before the calling out, then the token was applied. It's time for the church to get the Token, or a gross darkness is upon the people. Gross darkness!

L-134 Yes, clean out the cupboard, clean out this house, oh, we have a good old-fashion housecleaning! Let the Blood be applied, and then the Token will come in. Clean it out! Sanctify it!

L-135 Then apply the Token in prayer, with confidence, when you've cleaned yourself up. You've got away from the thing of the world. You've dumped all the unbelief out. "I don't care what the people says. If the Word of God says it, and promised it, I believe it. If the Word says it, that settles it. I don't care what anybody else says." See? Then when you got all that done, you've applied the Blood and you believe every Word, then take your Token in prayer, be fully convinced.

L-136 We read in--in Ephesians, 2nd chapter and 12 verse, about what God said about it, when we applied this Token. Notice, "serving the living God," with living works, and with living signs, with a living Token. Not dead works, and carnal, not dead works. Hebrews 9:11-14, tells us again, the same thing. Not dead creeds; but a living Token! They, these creeds, deny that there is such a thing as the Token. They don't even believe there is such a thing as the Token, the baptism of the Holy Ghost. [Ephesians 2:12], [Hebrews 9:11-14]

L-137 But we who believe the Word, know better, know, and it's His living Presence for us in this day. We've separated from dead works, and the Holy Ghost comes in to confirm the Word and make it so. Hebrews 13:8 proves that to us, proves that God has raised Him up for us, according to His promised Word. Thousands of years has passed, two thousand years, almost, has passed, but (what is it?) the Token still holds, that God raised Him up on the third day. If you've just got the Word, that's all you got. But when the Token is applied, then Christ is reality to you, and He does today like He did then. And so it throws it right back in their lap again; they can't get around it. God promised it, and here It is. But, the Token has got to be applied, you take the Token.

L-138 And when--and when you accept His sacrifice Blood, then He gives us Life, the Life of the Token, and it is a promised Seal. Ephesians 4:30, "Grieve not the Holy Spirit of God, whereby you are sealed until the day of your redemption." Then, being baptized into Him, First Corinthians 12, we've become part of His Body. [Ephesians 4:30], [I 64-0208, The Token, Kern County Fairgrounds, Bakersfield, CA, 80 min Corinthians 12:13]

L-139 And in Him is the fulness. In Him is all the sufficiency that we have need of. He is my pleasure. He is my Life. He is my joy. He is my... He is more... Not, I don't have to puff on a cigarette to get some kind of a relief. I take the Lily of the Valley. He is the opium. He is the thing that--that makes me walk in the clouds. He is my all-sufficient. He is my hopes. He is my rest. He is my God. He is my Saviour. He is my healer. He is all that I have need of. Because, I die, we die in Him, and are baptized in Him, and in Him is all sufficiency.

L-140 Listen close while I make this closing remarks. If Satan tries to hand you some of this stuff, like sickness, you know what you do? Just show him the Token. "I am a purchased product. My healing has been paid for. I am a product of God, because I have the Token of the Holy Ghost. You cannot keep me off of this Highway. You cannot keep me from my health. I present the Token and show you that my... 'By His stripes I was healed.' Here is the resurrection of Jesus Christ, right in me now, to prove it to you." Oh, there is the real thing! There is the Token.

L-141 That's the reason people don't believe It. That's the reason it's hard for them to see in. The Token has never been applied. See, that's the reason, say, "Oh, days of miracles has passed." You're doing that for a blind.

L-142 Jesus said, "Go ye into all the world, and preach the Gospel to every creature. He that believeth and is baptized shall be saved; he that believeth not shall be damned. These signs shall follow them that believe." How far? "To all the world, to every creature." "In My Name they shall cast out devils; they'll speak with new tongues; take up serpents; or drink deadly things, it won't harm them; if they lay their hands on the sick, they shall recover." Apply the Token, and then claim your rights. Shake It before Satan! [Mark 16:17-18]

L-143 The bus driver says, "Say!" The airplane man says, "Say! You can't get on this plane." "There is the token." Amen!

L-144 "You are too ragged. You're not... You're rags. You're too poor. We don't take little man, big man."

L-145 "But I hold the token." Amen! "You can't keep me off of it." Hallelujah! "When they give me the token, that settles it."

L-146 I have a right, as the rest of them have. I have a right, just the same as Paul had. I have a right, the same that any man was ever baptized with the Holy Ghost. I got the same right, because I got the same Token, to show the same God purchased by the same Thing for me, at the same day, on the same thing.

L-147 There you are, the Blood, the Blood! The Token, not the Blood chemistry, but the Token, the Holy Ghost, the Life out of the Blood, that comes. What does that Life does? Comes and confirms what the Token has been purchased for. The Token confirms what the--the Blood bought for you. The Blood purchased your redemption. The Token is an evidence of It. The Blood, "He was wounded for our transgressions, bruised for our iniquity; chastisement of our peace upon him; with his stripes we were healed." See, all Blood, Blood, Blood! Then when the Token comes, It shows that you've been identified with that Sacrifice. Amen! The devil can't keep you from it. [Isaiah 53:5]

L-148 That's when I stand at the platform here, to face everything there is, and around the world, and devils. God's Word promised it. As long as I can know that Blood has been applied, and holding that Holy Spirit here in my heart, the devil has not one word to say against it. Yes, sir.

L-149 "We'll walk where the apostles have trod," yes, sir, because the Token paid the way. The Token is the evidence that the way has been paid, and we've accepted It. And, to prove it, God gave us the Token, the sign that we was received.

L-150 A minister said to me one time, said, "Brother Branham, Abraham believed God, and it was imputed to him for righteousness." I said, "That's true." Said, "What more can a man do but believe?" I said, "That's exactly right." [James 2:23]

L-151 "Then where do you get this Holy Ghost, outside of believing?" 64-0208, The Token, Kern County Fairgrounds, Bakersfield, CA, 80 min

L-152 I said, "But He give him the seal of circumcision, as a confirmation of his faith." Amen. [Romans 4:11]

L-153 And if He has never give you the baptism of the Holy Ghost, yet, then He hasn't confirmed your faith that you say you have. But the Token is the confirmation.

L-154 I say, "I got the money, I paid it in the office down there!" But you've got to show the token. That's right. When I show the Token, I got a right.

L-155 And when I can show the Token, of the Holy Spirit, you've got the right to any purchased thing that Jesus Christ died for. It's the Token. Watch just a moment, as we close. Hold the Token over your unwavering faith in the promised Word. "I believe that Jesus said, 'Ask the Father anything in My Name, I'll do it.'" Hold your Token over that promised Word, and walk right to it. "'I'm the Lord that heals all thy diseases.' 'He was wounded for my transgressions, with His stripes I was healed.' Take my Token, of the Holy Spirit that's in me, hold It over my prayer, and say, 'Lord God, You promised it, "When I see the Token, I will reward you. I promised to do it."'" He can't do nothing else. He look right through the Blood of His Own Son. There is the Token applied. He has to do it because He promised it. [John 14:13], [Psalms 103:3], [Isaiah 53:5]

L-156 He could not go into a house, the death angel, destroyer, and take one out. He couldn't do it, because there was the blood of the lamb, the requirement of Jehovah.

L-157 And the requirement of Him, today, is the Blood of His Own Son, Jesus Christ, and the Token of the Holy Ghost. [Colossians 1:14]

L-158 We haven't got It; we might be Baptist, Presbysterian, Lutheran, Pentecostals, whatever we might be; we might shout, scream; we might be, oh, so educated. That has not one thing to do with It. You must present the Token.

L-159 Then, you are a subject for the resurrection, because the resurrecting Power is already in you. The Token is the resurrection Power, showing that Jesus raised up from the dead. And you are raised from the dead, the dead things of unbelief, and have been made alive in the Word of Jesus Christ. You believe it and the Word lives through you. [Romans 8:11]

L-160 "If ye abide in Me, and My Word in you, ask what you will." Saint John 14:12, "He that believeth in Me, the works that I do he shall do also; greater than this shall he do, because I go to the Father." "A little while, and the world seeth Me no more; yet you shall see Me, because I'll be with you, even in you." How did He? Not the body; it's sitting at the right hand of the Majesty. But the Token, that you have received Him, and He has give It back to you, take that Token and claim anything you wish to. God promised it. [John 14:12]

L-161 I've always said, I met two classes of people: the fundamentals, and the Pentecostals. The fundamentals, positionally, studies the Scriptures and figure it out. They say, "Well, we are sons of God." They believe that, yes, sir, but they don't have any faith with it. But the Pentecostals has a lot of faith, and they don't know they're sons of God. Like a man got money in the bank, can't write a check; and the other one can write a check, got no money in the bank.

L-162 If you could just ever get the thing together, till men and women could realize! You that's been truly baptized into the Holy Spirit, and you have the Token to display, you have a right to every redemptive blessings that God promised. Everything that He promised, is yours. Hold your Token over your unwavering faith, as you pray, and over His Word. Faith in His Word!

L-163 God once gave a Token to the people, and that was a rainbow. Looky, listen close; we're closing. God ever remained true to that token. Way back in the days of Noah, at the destruction of the antediluvian world, God gave this nation, or give the world, a rainbow sign, for a token. And God ever displays His token, as the thousands of years rolled by. He never fails, because He watches His tokens. All these thousands of years, He has displayed It to us, showing us that He never fails to honor the token. He never fails to honor it. [Genesis 9:16-17]

L-164 He expects us now to display the Token over our faith, to Satan's group, and the unbelievers, and cults, and so forth, that don't believe in It; that we believing what He has said of His promises, and that Jesus Christ has raised up from the dead, showing Himself alive. And That is the badge, the Token of identification, because it's Christ's Own 64-0208, The Token, Kern County Fairgrounds, Bakersfield, CA, 80 min Life in you, identifying the Word. It doesn't need anything else.

L-165 That's the Token. Without the Token... Shows the fare is paid! Shows that you are a subject for the resurrection! That God, that same Power that raised up Jesus from the grave, you are holding within yourself, as a Token. The Holy Ghost, in you, is the Token that brings you from the grave. Because, the Token is God, the Holy Spirit, which is Eternal Life. Coming from the Greek word, Zoe, which means "God's Own Life" in you. And that's the only thing that pays the price. If that Token isn't there, how are you going to raise? [Romans 8:11]

L-166 Brother, sister, tonight, with all fairness to God and to His Word, and to each other, and to the time that we're now living in! If you're without the Token, if you don't have the Token; some of you might not even believe It, but It's here. The Token has been here since Christ died. Why don't you identify yourself, in death to your own thinking, tonight, and let the thoughts that's in Him be in you? "Let the meditation of my heart be acceptable to Thee, O Lord. Let Thy Word..." "If ye abide in Me, and My Word in you," that is Him, "then ask what you will and it'll be given to you." Don't you believe that? [Congregation says, "Amen."--Ed.] [John 15:7]

L-167 Let us bow our heads a moment. [Blank.spot.on.tape--Ed.]

L-168 How many people in here that knows, that the way you live, that you really haven't got that Token applied, you know It isn't there? You believe It, you absolutely believe It; but you haven't got It, you know you haven't? Would you just raise you hand, say, "Pray for me, Brother Branham"? Let all heads be down. God bless you.

L-169 "I haven't got It. I haven't, Brother Branham. I tried to accept It. I believe It, but really It hasn't been applied to me yet. I look in the glass, I see I'm not there. I look at the way I--I feel, what's in my soul, I'm full of temper, anger, I'm jealous. I've got all..." Oh, my! That would grieve the Holy Spirit from you, right now. See? See?

L-170 "And I tell you, I--I--I do, I see the Word and see It confirmed; but yet I--I've just got a bunch of people that I go with, to my church, or my society, my card party, or something. I just can't give them up."

L-171 That shows you haven't got the Token. "If you love the world, or the things of the world, the love of God is not..." "Come out from among them," the Bible said, "touch not their unclean things." [I John 2:15]

L-172 Friends, it can't be made more real than it is now. It can't be. The Token is here, if we'll believe It. Do you believe It? [Congregation says, "Amen."--Ed.] Will you accept It. All right.

L-173 Lord Jesus, they're in Your hands now. May the Token, the Token, that Jesus is not dead; the Token, that Jesus raised up from the dead and is here tonight. He's the Token of His resurrection. He Himself is the Word. He is here to confirm everything He said. He is here to confirm every promise that He made. If the people could just only see it once, Lord, that it isn't something that we could guess about. It's something we must know, Lord. There is no "try over," you can't go back and try again. It must be done now. I pray, God, that every person will receive Him, tonight, and may the Token of the Blood be applied to every heart. And then may there be a revival come through this country here, that'll be great. Father, we commit it into Your hands, in Jesus Christ's Name. Amen.

L-174 Now while we're in prayer, everybody real quiet, don't no one move now, just a minute.

L-175 Do you believe this is the Truth, that the Token has got to be displayed? [Congregation says, "Amen."--Ed.] It had, in every time, every age, It had to be displayed.

L-176 Now, what is the Token, is the confirmation of His Word. That, that shows He is the Word. Now, the Word said He raised up from the dead, and He is alive forevermore. He lives in His people, the same yesterday, today, and forever. Do you believe that? [Congregation says, "Amen."--Ed.] If you believe that, then you have a right; if you have that Token, the Holy Spirit, in you, you have a right to everything that His death purchased for you. Won't you believe it? Now look, so... [Romans 6:4], [Hebrews 13:8]

L-177 Now, tonight, we wasn't going to pray for the sick, tonight. We're going to do that tomorrow afternoon. But we're--we're, tonight, we was going to make this altar call.

L-178 Here, friends. If you ever was healed, if you live long enough you're going to get sick again. But if you one time take that Token, you've had It forever. "Grieve not the Holy Spirit of God, whereby you are sealed until the Day of 64-0208, The Token, Kern County Fairgrounds, Bakersfield, CA, 80 min your Redemption." Not to the next revival; you wasn't sealed; you got emotionally worked up. "But you are dead, and your life is hid in God, through Christ, and you are sealed by the Holy Ghost." If you are once baptized into that Holy Spirit! Now, you can backslide, that is true. But you can't get away from that Seal. You're sealed into It. [Ephesians 4:30], [Colossians 3:3]

L-179 Now if you haven't got that Seal, let's be real sincere. We got a place fixed here, and, for everybody, we can receive the Holy Ghost. And if He heals the sick... Why did He put that upon my heart then to do this?

L-180 Now, that same Jesus, that was raised up from the dead, is right here now. Now listen. The Word can't say one thing and mean another. He said, "Wherever two or three are gathered in My Name, there I am in their midst." Is that right? [Congregation says, "Amen."--Ed.] [Matthew 18:20]

L-181 Now look up this a way, as you do. How many in here is sick, raise up your hands. Just say, "I'm sick, I'm needy, or I..." You don't have to be sick. Just say, "I have a need of God. Brother Branham, I have need of God, for something. I--I--I believe Jesus is here."

L-182 Now hold your Token right over that desire. Now let me tell you, by His Word, He--He cannot go contrary to that Word. He has already purchased your desire, if it's according to His will. And His will is to heal. His will is to give you your desire. "He'll withhold no good thing from them that walk upright before Him," presenting that Token.

L-183 Now, you're strangers to me. But, just a moment, that you might see. Now here is the ministers sitting behind me, people all around. There is belief and unbelief here, it's always that way. You can feel it coming in. But it's anointing of the Holy Spirit, and that Holy Spirit is that Token. He is that Token.

L-184 Now, you don't have to do it. Everybody wasn't a Moses; there was one Moses, but the people follow it. Now you just believe this, that He is a living today. He is here as a witness. Now each one of you has got something on your heart. Pray.

L-185 Now, if He was here, you would say, "Lord Jesus, will You heal me?" He would say, "I've already did it." See, He couldn't do it again. He has already done it, but He just wanting you to believe it. [I Peter 2:24]

L-186 Now, He did promise, in the last days, that what God did in a human flesh, just before Sodom, the end of the Gentile world, it would be repeated again. He promised that. Now will He keep that promise?

L-187 He promised, Malachi 4, that He would do this, and manifest His Word, "to turn the hearts of the children back to the fathers again," back to the original pentecostal Word, the real, Bible Word. Not the... [Malachi 4:5-6]

L-188 The Pentecostal, they claim, Pentecostal organization, "There is no such a thing."

L-189 Pentecost is an experience, not an organization. They tried to organize it, but you can't, see. It doesn't organize. Pentecost is an experience, It's the Seal of God, the Holy Spirit that come on the Day of Pentecost.

L-190 Now you believe. Look this a way and believe that I've told you the Truth. And if He will manifest Himself; I don't know whether He will or not. But, if He will, that'll show that, the Token that I'm talking about, that the Blood has been applied, and the Token is here to identify that Blood is correct, that Jesus Christ has raised from the dead. You believe that? [Congregation says, "Amen."--Ed.] Well, that, how, what more clearer could it be? See? Just believe It. [I Corinthians 15:20]

L-191 Brother, sister, and friends, in the Name of Jesus Christ, believe It, for the sake of your soul and for the sake of others. You'll never have another opportunity.

L-192 If God would have spoke to me back before the foundation of the world, when I was a thought in His mind, so were you, if He'd have said, "What age would you want to live in?" I'd have said right now. This is it, the most glorious time that there is.

L-193 Believe, won't you? Now, that you might know that Jesus Christ lives. Now just, in your heart, pray, and say, "Lord, You're a High Priest that can be touched by the feeling of our infirmities, and I believe that You are the Token. Now speak to me, that I might be healed." [Hebrews 4:15]

L-194 Somebody, and go in sections, like, you can see where, so as I won't have to be turning back and forth, this way. 64-0208, The Token, Kern County Fairgrounds, Bakersfield, CA, 80 min You notice the times...

L-195 See, a vision, when you see a vision, it has to be interpreted, also. It's turned around. So, so sometime when you got hundreds a pulling, you can just... and it just has to single out. Now, everybody real reverent for just a few minutes.

L-196 Then, that'll prove. If a man says anything, and--and--and God don't back it up, well, then it couldn't be God. But if God backs it up, then you've got Him to talk to, for that. May it happen for the glory of God, as I stand here to represent this Word to be the Truth. There is a man sitting right there. If you...

L-197 I--I just wish that you could see in this dimension, this Light. Now, right now... See, something happened; He just pulled it out, like the human part lays aside. That's a gift. And when it does, then it's--it's another world.

L-198 There is a man sitting there, and he's praying. And, what's the matter with him, he has had an operation or something, in the intestines. And its been sometime ago, but it isn't doing right. I hope he doesn't miss it. But God will help me, I'll call his name. Mr. Price, believe I don't know you, sir, I'm a stranger to you. If that's right, stand up on your feet. If that's right and knows... It that true? Yes, sir.

L-199 Now don't you see? What is it? It's the Token identifying that Jesus Christ raised from the dead and is the same yesterday, today, and forever, working through human flesh just like He did there before Abraham, the elected Church, before Sodom. And Jesus said, "It shall return again, in the coming of the Son of man." [Hebrews 13:8]

L-200 Here, here is another man sitting here, looking right at me, a real contact. The man is suffering with a stomach trouble and a back trouble. His name is Mr. Flannigan. I don't know you, but that's true. That's your wife sitting there by you. She is suffering, too. Do you believe that God is able to tell me now, and your fine contact of faith? Your wife has a back trouble. And she has got a female trouble, it's in the womb. That's THUS SAITH THE LORD.

L-201 Now, what is it? Who is doing that? The Bible said, that, "He is a High Priest that can be touched by the feeling of our infirmities." The Bible said, "The Word of God is sharper than a two-edged sword," in Its preaching, cutting to the asunder, and don't pay no attention to a celebrity, or a denomination, or anything. And then It also identifies Itself as a what? "A discerner of the thoughts that's in the heart." Is that right? That's exactly right. If you could only believe that! Just believe it with all your heart. [Hebrews 4:12, 15]

L-202 There is a lady sitting right here. She has got tumors. She isn't from here. She is from Sacramento. Her name is Mrs. Bradley. Stand up on your feet, if that's right, lady, and we're strangers. And raise your hands if that's right. Is that right? I truly believe they're gone. Now that was just a woman sitting there.

L-203 Here is a lady sitting way back here. She has got on a hat, kind of a brown-looking hat. It's got feathers. She's putting her glasses off. She is sitting there, praying. She was praying for something to happen. What's makes that woman do that? That woman has just been healed of a heart trouble. She is praying for her brother, and he has heart trouble. And she has got a brother-in-law that's not saved, and she--she is praying for him to be saved. That's THUS SAITH THE LORD. If that's right, lady, stand up on your feet, so the people can know. She was sitting right there, saying this, praying for them people then. If that's right, wave your hand, lady, back and forth, so they can see.

L-204 How could I tell her what she was praying about, from the platform here?

L-205 Here is a man sitting right here. He is suffering with trouble in his knees. He is praying for a friend that's crippled. He--he, really, he isn't from here. He is from Santa Maria, a place called Santa Maria. And his name, they call him Tony. Stand up, if that's right. I'm a stranger to you.

L-206 Hold your Token before your prayer! God, when that Angel of the Lord met me years ago... When I first come in here, I took the people by the hand, I told you that He told me this would come to pass. Now there is something greater than that. See? See? And it's constantly going, (why?) holding that Token before that. See, the Holy Spirit, Itself, It lives. It's the One that does it. He said.

L-207 Now if anybody is in doubt, go around these people and ask them if I ever seen them, knowed them, or anything 64-0208, The Token, Kern County Fairgrounds, Bakersfield, CA, 80 min else. They're here. It's just beginning to happen all over the building now.

L-208 Now, here, if God can discern that, let me tell you something. There is scores of you here, tonight, that needs the baptism of the Holy Ghost, to hold that Token. You're, you're... You're just thinking you've got It, when you haven't. Don't take that chance, friends. Believe me. If you believe me to be God's prophet... Or, pardon me, I didn't mean to say that. I don't call myself a prophet. God's servant, if you believe I'm God's servant, I'm telling you, in the Name of the Lord. While we bow our heads, just a moment.

L-209 This is the great call. I want every person in here, that's not a Christian, come up here a minute and let me pray with you, and lay hands upon you, while the Holy Spirit is on me, while the anointing is here. The Token is displayed, infallible proofs! Will you keep real quiet? Move out of your seat and come up now.

L-210 If the sister there, or whoever the song leader is, give us the chord of music now.

L-211 Will you come up. And just every person that's not a Christian, come up here and stand here at the altar, just a moment. That's good. The Lord bless you, my brother. The Lord bless you, sister. Come right up around the altar here. Every person... Come, every soul now of sin oppressed, There is mercy with the Lord.

L-212 Now will you do it? That's right. Come right up here, stand here just a moment, you without Christ. Look, the hour is getting late, friends. The death angel might separate between the Bride and the church, at anytime. Won't you... Every soul of sin oppressed, There's mercy with the Lord, Won't you come now while they're singing? He will surely give you rest.

L-213 Why? Giving you the Token, then you're at rest, you see. You have the identification. The Lord sent His Message, identified It, the Pillar of Fire. Only trust Him, only...

L-214 Christians, you who have the Token, pray. Sinners without Christ, will you come, while He is so clearly identified here, as the Token. The Token, He is not dead, He is raised from the dead. Will you come now? Will save you, He will save you now. Only trust...

L-215 Just trust Him! You say, "Brother Branham, I don't know how to do it." Come up here, just all you have to do is just raise right up. Listen to the Holy Spirit. That's the way that these things work, just listen to Him. He promised it. Just as He promised to do these things in the last day, He promised to save the lost.

L-216 You say, "Well, I belong to the church, Brother Branham." That ain't what I'm asking you.

L-217 I'm asking you now, "Are you saved? Are you a Christian?" If not, come up. Come up. I ask you, in Christ's Name, come. Trust Him, only...

L-218 That's it, come right in, come right on around the altar now, brother. He will save you, He will save you, He will save you now. What do you have to do? Just only trust Him, only trust Him, Only trust Him now; He will save you, He will save you, He will save you now. 64-0208, The Token, Kern County Fairgrounds, Bakersfield, CA, 80 min

L-219 That's right, come right on, friends, come right on. Every Christian, pray right now. Remember, people might come, this might be the last opportunity they'll ever have. This might be. If He can discern the thoughts of the heart, He tells me and it's true, "Many in here!" Don't let Satan deceive you, sister, brother. Don't let him do it, please don't. Receive God's Token, tonight. Will you come now? Now! You'll only trust Him, only trust Him, Only trust Him now; He will save you, He will save you, He will save you now.

L-220 O God, I pray that in Jesus' Name, that You will look down upon this audience and will comb it through. I pray that the great Holy Spirit, Who is here now, present, showing Jesus Christ the same yesterday, today, and forever... Lord, there is no chance for Satan to try to rub around it. Here You--You are identifying Yourself, standing here in human flesh among us, and identifying Yourself by the Token that would identify You. The Token is to identify Jesus Christ, His resurrection. And here It is now identifying Him, doing the same that He did when He stood here in a corporal body. O Father God, may the people see and realize how all these Scriptures and things are perfectly fulfilled.

L-221 May every soul come now, Lord. Go once more, Father, and speak to the hearts, so I'll be sure that... I've asked You, and I know You are going to do it. You always answer our prayers. Speak once more, Lord. I'm sure there were some felt that they should, but they just didn't do it. Grant it, Lord, that they'll come now. Through Jesus' Name, I ask.

L-222 With our heads bowed, rise (won't you?) and come now while we sing it again now. And come right out, walk out. I just feel down in my heart; That's never wrong. See? Only trust Him,

L-223 Will you raise up? Come down here, stand around the altar. Don't... This might be the last opportunity that you ever have. If that little question has been in your mind, don't--don't take no chance. Don't take no chance, friend. See, the rains come, and the people didn't know it. The death angel struck, the people didn't think it was so. Moses told them it was going to happen. He was clearly identified by God.

L-224 You say, "But I'm Presbyterian. I'm Methodist. I'm Baptist." I don't... That don't even have nothing. See?

L-225 Come! I'm asking you to come now, come and really receive Him. Don't... You would be real sure if you checked your tires before you drove fast, check your car before you take your vacation. Won't you have the identification of the resurrection within you? Won't you come? God bless you. That's fine. Six, seven, eight more has come since then. I just hate to close it, like. Will you come? God bless you, young fellow. Bless you, lady. Now He will save you, He will save you.

L-226 God bless you, young man. If you want to know, you were one of them. That's it. Only trust Him,

L-227 Now, isn't that something, to see them come up? Him... See, the Holy Spirit is never wrong. It's perfectly right. Now He will save you, He will save you, He will save you now.

L-228 Are you real sure now? As the music continues on, if you will, slowly. Could you trust Him? Could you just take Him at His Word?

L-229 Say, "Lord, I've always wanted that close fellowship, that real something. I, I really want It, Lord, but I've seen so much mockery of It." Why, sure, that's Satan, he--he does that to throw you off the track. "I--I've seen those who claimed." That, that, see, it only shows there is a real One somewhere. If you find a bogus dollar, it's just because that it's made off of a good one. See? See?

L-230 Won't you come? Really trust Him for the Holy Spirit. When He is so identified here before you, identifying Himself here before about three thousand people, showing. He has did it before five hundred thousand in Bombay. He did it before, around a hundred and fifty or seventy-five thousand in Durban, South Africa, where thirty thousand 64-0208, The Token, Kern County Fairgrounds, Bakersfield, CA, 80 min blanket natives come to Christ at one time. See? The Gospel is about finished in America, friends. She is about over. If you believe me to be connected with God, remember, that is true. Won't you come now?

L-231 I'm going to ask our minister brothers here, if they'll come off the platform, and stand around here, with this prayer for the people.

L-232 The rest of you may bow your heads, unless you want to come while they just stand around the altar here. I'm going to pray with you.

L-233 I want you man to get down there, because these people will become members of your churches. They've come, accepting Christ now.

L-234 Won't you come, stand around, anyone else would like to come at this time? The altar is still open. They might not... It might be too late, after a while.

L-235 Just think, the great Holy Spirit coming, identifying Jesus Christ alive, after two thousand years, see the very Nature of Him doing the same thing as He promised it would be done. That's right.

L-236 I'm so grateful for you, friends. You're that eleventh-hour people standing here, just getting in. I'm so glad you come. Each one of you, remember, it was God Who told you to come. Humanly, you wouldn't have done it, but God told you to do it.

L-237 Now while these brethren here and I am praying, may the Lord... [Someone asks Brother Branham about the other minister brothers--Ed.] "If a minister is over here?" Sure, any ministering brethren, come here. You have churches and things around here; come, gather around with this people. These are people that's strayed, some of them. Some of them are coming for their first time, and they are standing here now. Walk right up among them. Pull right in among them. Just move yourself right in, tell them, "I'm Pastor So-and-so. I'm here to pray with you, brother. I love you. I love you, and I am here to pray with you."

L-238 Look, come, of you, come up this way. Come up this way, there is a room in here. Some of you up this way. Just...

L-239 That's it, move right in among the people, say, "I am Pastor So-and-so." Put your hand on somebody's shoulder, say, "I come to pray with you, dear sister, dear brother. I come to help you to Christ." Just move right in now, say, "I, I'll be glad to do anything for you I can. We're going to pray now."

L-240 I've asked the congregation if they'll bow their heads with us now, while we go to prayer.

L-241 Each one of you pastors, get you a person, get somebody that you got your hands on. Each pastor, get among the people, so you got your hands on somebody. That's it.

L-242 Each one of you confess that you've been wrong. And, remember, that same Jesus now is right here. So help me, that Light is right here among you. He is Christ. Just ask Him to forgive you, and God will cleanse you from every sin. Just stay right there now. And the pastor will lead you right to repentance and right on to the Token, and this will settle it.

L-243 Lord Jesus, we bring to You, tonight, Lord, all these handkerchiefs and things, for the glory of God, that You would heal each and every one of them, for Your glory.

L-244 Father, this audience, we see You so clearly identified by Your Word. Identified as the Person of the Lord Jesus, here in the form of the Holy Ghost, moving through the people, discerning the thoughts that's in their heart, healing their sickness, and calling them to repentance, the great mighty Son of God. I give them to You, Father, as tokens of their faith in Your believed... in Your predicted Word. The Word that You said that You would. I trust, Lord, that You'll confirm It to them. They are Yours. They are love-gifts; I give them to You, Father. In Jesus Christ's Name, save every one of them, Lord. Fill every one of them with the Holy Ghost. Grant it, O Eternal God. Let Your Spirit and mercy be upon them, for Your glory. 64-0208, The Token, Kern County Fairgrounds, Bakersfield, CA, 80 min Courtesy of Living Word Broadcast P. O.
