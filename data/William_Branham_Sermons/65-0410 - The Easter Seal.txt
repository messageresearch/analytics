--- TRANSCRIPT ---

L-1 Certainly a privilege to be here this morning, on this birthday of the Full Gospel Business Men's chapter here at Phoenix, and to know that the Lord granted me a little part of it, to be part of this fellowship. I want to greet Brother Carl Williams and his wife, Brother Stromei, the rest here at the platform, Brother Shores, Brother Outlaw, the ministers, and all you fine people.

L-2 You know, I--I had a birthday last week, too. And I'm just a teeny bit older than a chapter. I believe he said, "Five and... years old, for the chapter."

L-3 Somebody said, other day, said, "How old are you, Brother Branham?" I said "Twenty-six." And I said, "I wiped out the first twenty-five years. I didn't serve Him so well in them." I said, "I hope He does, too." To get Him to do it will be different.

L-4 But it's good to be here. And now we want to not take much of your time. Because we... I'm--I'm always afraid, after I hear some of these fine testimonies, and things that's going on, that I... and songs, that I will do something that'll upset that. And I wanted to add to it, if there'd be anything I could add to it. These sisters...

L-5 That brother that sang the song this morning, the colored brother, I appreciated that, The Eye On The Sparrow.

L-6 And these sisters that sang this song, that's been one of my helps since I was here the first time. I have that. I got that on a record, and I've just played it out, I'd Like To Talk It Over With Him. And I asked Brother Dawson Riley there, my friend, if he would, some of them, if they'd see if they get those ladies, if they were still here on earth, to sing it again this morning. And I hope Terry got it. And I suppose he did. I want to take that off there, maybe, to a record or something, 'cause I really like that song. And that's my--my desire, is to talk it over with Him. I think we all want to do that. That's why we're here this morning.

L-7 Now, the oncoming meetings, next week. Is it all right to mention? [A brother says, "Sure."--Ed.] I--I to be home this coming week, at the tabernacle, next Sunday, for Easter service; Saturday night, Sunday, and Sunday night. And then I go back to California. All you people around California, be sure glad to have you at the meeting over there. And I think Billy has sent out the wrong advertisement. Is... He said, "At the Biltmore Hotel," I believe, "it's to be at." It's... [Someone says, "Couldn't get it."] Couldn't get it. And it's at the Eastmont? ["Embassy."] Embassy, the Embassy Hotel. So any of the Full Gospel people over there would let you know, if you're over that way.

L-8 And then we come back from there, and I go to South Africa then. Just one month from today, we sail for South Africa, expecting a great time in the Lord, about three nations down there. So we--we certainly solicit your prayers. I probably won't be able to see you no more, if the Lord carries on for us to go, until I get back. And hope I have a great report for you when we come back.

L-9 Last time down there, I think that the Lord gave me the greatest meeting I ever had. And one time, for an altar call... Now, this is out of blanket natives. As far as I know, there was thirty thousand accepted Christ at one time. And we thought maybe they meant physical healing, because there had been about twenty-five thousand healed at one time. And the next day, the mayor of--of Durban, which is Sydney Smith, said, "Go to your window, look coming down the street." And there were van load after van load, just piled full of old crutches and things, just piled up, that they were coming behind. The natives, which was at war with one another, coming down the streets of the city, singing Only Believe in their native tongue.

L-10 I tell you, my heart thrilled. Like... When you see something like that, Brother Shores, you to feel your work is not in vain then. You see, you tried. And I hope that God repeats it again, not because--because we're going down there, but because we're looking for the Coming of the Lord.

L-11 And as the song said, we're seeking out that little, lost sheep. That's that... He--He won't come until that sheep is in. Every one has to be in the fold. He won't close the door till that last one is in. So, minister brothers, I'm sure with you, 65-0410, The Easter Seal, Ramada Inn, Phoenix, AZ, 137 min this morning, of trying to hunt out that last sheep. It might be in Phoenix, this morning. I don't know. But when the last one comes in, then the Shepherd will close the door. [Luke 15:4]

L-12 [A brother says, "Brother Branham?"--Ed.] Yes? ["Could I just say a word?"] You certainly can. ["I forgot something. We've been talking about..." Blank.spot.on.tape.] That's perfectly all right. ["And I know, everybody forgets something, once in a while."] I don't. ["Oh!"]

L-13 I'm the one that has to write out what I'm going to say, almost. I'm... Since I getting older, I find it harder to remember, put my Scriptures down, and so forth. Used to be, I could line up about fifty Scriptures in my mind, and never even... pass right on through it, but I got a lot of rough miles behind them days.

L-14 So, we're looking for the Coming of the Lord. Lord bless you all!

L-15 And then you get up here, and you think. You set down here and hear these people testify. You think, "Well, when I get up, I'm going to say something about that." Then, there's so much to say, you'd be all day saying it. But, I certainly appreciate you all. May this little chapter just keep growing. May every church in Phoenix continually to grow until Jesus comes, is my sincere prayer.

L-16 Now, I think, just to rest us just a little bit, let's stand while we have prayer. Will you?

L-17 Almighty God, the Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, Who raised Him up from the dead, and has give Him unto us as the sacrifice, and a Lord and Saviour. We are so grateful to Thee for this privilege that we have this morning, to stand in Thy Presence, with Thy people that's been redeemed and looking for His glorious second Coming, to receive us unto Himself. If there be sin among us, Lord, purge us with Thy hyssop. And we pray, Heavenly Father, that You will heal every sick person that's in our midst. [Psalms 51:7]

L-18 And if there would be, by chance, those who doesn't know You, in this great baptism of the Holy Spirit that we're so earnestly contending for, and saying it is a must, according to the Scripture for this last day. We pray, God, that He will fall upon us all, today, and baptize us a freshly into the Body, and bring those that are out, in, too, Father. [Jude 1:3], [Acts 4:31]

L-19 Bless us as we read Thy Word and endeavor to speak that which is Truth of Thy Word. Close our mouths to that which is untruth, and open our hearts and mouths to that which is Truth, as we commit ourselves to Thee. Use our mouths to speak, and our ears to hear, and our hearts to receive. For we ask it in Jesus' Name, Who has ordained it to be so. Amen.

L-20 I would like to read from the Holy Word, three places in the Bible. And if you would mark these, and you want to carry them on through, to read them for further information, I'd be very happy if you would mark them down. The places I'm going to read is Matthew 28:1-10, and then Revelations 1:17-18, Romans 8:11. May I repeat them again. And now Matthew 28:1 to 10, Revelations 1:17 to 18, and Romans 8:11. [Matthew 28:1-10], [Revelation 1:17-18], [Romans 8:11]

L-21 Now we are approaching Easter. And as you're getting your places, and marking it down. I think that this coming week is the most and the greatest historical week of all of the weeks of the year. I think that the greatest thing we will celebrate this week, this coming week, was the greatest event that ever taken place on the earth. I don't think anything could surpass it. You say, "Well, the--the crucifixion was great." But many men has died, many men has been crucified, even in the same days of our Lord. But there was only One of Them Who rose up from the dead. That sealed it.

L-22 Now I want to read. And this is kind of a little pre-Easter message, the Lord willing, about forty minutes. Now let's read from Saint Matthew's Gospel, the 28th chapter, beginning. In the end of the sabbath, as it begin to dawn towards the first day of the week, came Mary Magdalene and the other Mary to see the sepulchre.And, behold, there was a great earthquake: for the angel of the Lord descended from heaven, and came and rolled back the stone from the door, and sat upon it.His countenance was like lightning, and his raiment white as snow:And for fear of him the quakers did... the keepers (pardon me) did shake, and became as dead men.And the angel answered and said unto the women, Fear ye not: for I know that you seek Jesus, which was crucified.He is not here: for he is risen, 65-0410, The Easter Seal, Ramada Inn, Phoenix, AZ, 137 min as he said. Come and see the place where the Lord lay.And go quickly, and tell his disciples that he is risen from the dead: and, behold, he goeth before you into Galilee; there shall ye see him: lo, I have told you.And they departed quickly from the sepulchre with fear and great joy; and did run and bring the disciples word.And as they went to tell his disciples, behold, Jesus met them, saying, All hail. And they came and held him by the feet, and worship him.Then said Jesus unto them, Be not afraid: go tell my brethren that they go into Galilee, and there shall they see me. [Matthew 28:1-10]

L-23 And Revelations, the 1st chapter, and the 17th and 18th verse. And when I saw him, I fell at his feet as dead. And he laid his right hand upon me, saying unto me, Fear not; I am the first and the last:I am he that liveth, and was dead; and, behold, I am alive for evermore, Amen; and have the keys of death and hell. [Revelation 1:17-18]

L-24 And in the Book of Romans, the 8th chapter, and beginning with the 11th verse. But if the Spirit of him that raised up Jesus from the dead dwell in you, he that raised up Christ from the dead shall also quicken your mortal bodies by his Spirit that dwelleth in you. [Romans 8:11]

L-25 Now I trust that the Lord Jesus will add His blessings to the readings of these Words. Seeing that, Easter, I have stamped it in my own heart as the greatest meeting, or the greatest event of the--the year.

L-26 I want to ask you to pardon me a moment. Isn't that kind of blaring out there to you, kind of a roaring? Is it all right? Can you hear it all right like that? Oh! You can't hear it. Is that better, right like that? I didn't want to get too close.

L-27 Now, why I say this, is because that, Easter, He proved what the Bible had said. All the Scripture that was written of Him to do, He sealed His Messiahship when He rose from the dead, the Easter seal. We have so much of it today we talk about, that, buying Easter seals. Well, I want to speak this morning on: The Easter Seal. It's a different seal than what we buy with our money, as a seal to go on letters for, I think, the Tuberculosis Association or whatever they call it. I--I think this seal is a little different seal. And being that Easter is the great day of the year for we Christians who claim to be God's children, I want to try to break into it and see how we should be fellowship with this great thing that Christ did for us. [Acts 10:41]

L-28 The Word of God was spoken many, many hundreds of years before His Coming, of His crucifixion, and of His death, and of His suffering, and also of His resurrection. We'll be going through these services, perhaps, next week, as we listen to our--our radio programs; and in our churches, with our pastors, and so forth, this coming week. [Isaiah 53:1-12]

L-29 But of all the days and all of the things that Jesus did, and certainly appreciating all of His vindication of God's Word and what He did to fulfill It: of healing the sick, raising the dead, casting out devils, preaching the Gospel to the poor, and fulfilling every Word that God said that He would do when He came; and then also suffering for our sins, in our stead, to be the propitiation for sin, at the cross, where no one else could have done it but Him. But above all of that, I think Easter sealed the whole thing. [Matthew 10:8], [Luke 9:2]

L-30 Because, there had been prophets on the earth, who had prophesied before Him. There had been prophets on the earth, who had healed the sick, even raised the dead, and done the same signs that Jesus did. [II Kings 8:5], [II Kings 5:10]

L-31 But Easter proved it. It sealed the Word of God forever, for the true believer. All gloom and doubt was shattered, at that blessful morning. Man had been shut up, as it was, in a prison house, even to religious people before this day, because they had been... seen great religious moves, and moving of the Holy Spirit, and so forth. But when a man died, it seemed to settle it. But when this One came, and said, "I have power to lay My life down; I have power to take It up again." And then go prove what He said. To me, that--that's the seal of it, when--when something is said and then is turned around and proven. [John 10:18]

L-32 If a man said, like Columbus, believed the world was round, and he watched the ships, as we're told, how they come in, and he could see the mast way before he could see the ship. And it proved him that the world was round. 65-0410, The Easter Seal, Ramada Inn, Phoenix, AZ, 137 min People didn't believe that in that day, but he was a man of vision. He set out to prove exactly what he had a vision of, that was the truth.

L-33 And God purposed to prove His Word, the Truth. So He... There was only one Man that could do that, and that was Jesus. And He come and proved that to be the Truth. It sealed it. And that broke all the seals of gloom, and scattered all the--the superstitions of other religions, and so forth, where great men has raised up and said great, marvelous things; but they're, every one, in the grave. But our Christian religion is the only one who has the empty tomb. And that proves to me that He is the God of the dead, and God of the living, that He could raise up the dead, back to life again. And this quickening power, quickening Spirit of His, has proved through the years that He is the One Who can quicken the dead, back to life again. [Romans 8:11]

L-34 And when He proved by His promise, this great conquering power that He had, on Easter He proved that He could conquer death, hell, and the grave. "I am He that was dead, and is alive again, and alive forevermore; and have the keys to--to death, hell, and the grave." What a--a statement for anyone to make. And not only did He make it, but He had already proved that He--He had what He claimed to have. , [Revelation 1:18]

L-35 And I think, God hasten the day that when we, as Christians who believe this Bible, can prove what we are talking about. See? That's what makes, as said a while ago, "The salt of the earth," the sister said. That's right. The world is looking for this salt. And when we can prove by our lives, and by the Bible, that our lives are vindicating that Word to be living today, that that's the day we're looking for. [Colossians 4:6], [Matthew 5:13]

L-36 The Word, "This Spirit..." Romans 8 there, that 11, said, "If this Spirit that raised up Jesus Christ be in you, will also quicken your mortal bodies." Not only did He prove to Him, to us, that He was Jehovah Redeemer and had power over death, hell and the grave, but He has also give us the access to the same Spirit, that we ourselves can have the assurance that we too are quickened by that Spirit. For the Spirit that raised up Jesus from the dead dwells in your body. It will also quicken your mortal body. Now, the word quicken means "to be made alive after death." After it's dead, then it's to be quickened. [Romans 8:11], [Revelation 1:18]

L-37 The world has been shut up in doubt, for many ages until then. This was proven, not only talked about, but was proven. I think that anything that's worthwhile...

L-38 As Jesus said, "Go ye therefore, teach all nations; and prove to them, by demonstrating the power of God to them. These signs shall follow them that believe." Them who promise and say they believe, He give us a definite understanding of it, that, "These signs would follow them that believe." It would be the proof of their testimony. Now, we can say we believe. But until we are have the proven sign that He said that would be upon us, then we are just confessing to be believers, and not the possession of believers. [Matthew 28:19], [Mark 16:17]

L-39 For, remember, a few days ago, I was listening to a--a radio program on KAIR down in Tucson. And this minister had taken the side against us, that, "The pentecostal religion was nothing but just a sham. There was... Not to listen to it. It was unstable." And said, "Any man that spoke in tongues, and these things, and claim to be, heal the sick, and so forth, by prayer, that it was to leave away from it. And to pray for those poor decrepit people, because that they were in a--an illusion, that there was something wrong with them." Oh, how I could have liked to have talked to that brother just a while! And he said that the... "That, that was only given for the apostles at the Day of Pentecost, and that was all."

L-40 I find that, thirty years later, Paul was ordaining these gifts in the Church. In First Corinthians 15, that, "He set in the Church the gift of speaking in tongues, miracles. And all these other gifts was set in the Church." [I Corinthians 12:1-31]

L-41 Jesus said that. "Go ye into all the world and preach the Gospel to every creature." How far? "All the world." Who to? "Every creature." They've never received It yet. "And these signs shall follow them that believe." How long? "All the world." Who to? "Every creature. These signs shall follow them, in all the world, and in every creature. These signs shall follow them: in My Name they shall cast out devils; speak with new tongues; if they taken up a deadly thing, or serpent, or drinking a deadly thing, will not harm them; they'll lay their hands on the sick, and they shall recover." That 65-0410, The Easter Seal, Ramada Inn, Phoenix, AZ, 137 min was His last commission to the Church, Mark the 16th chapter. [Mark 16:15], [Luke 9:2], [Mark 16:18], [Matthew 28:19]

L-42 Paul is ordaining these gifts into the Church, thirty years later. And said, in Galatians 1:8, "If an Angel from Heaven preaches to you any other Gospel than This which is already received," see, already been preached, "let him be accursed." I believe that pentecost began without an ending. I believe it's to be to every creature, all times, at all places, that pentecost should always remain. The pentecostal blessings should be upon the people. [Galatians 1:8]

L-43 And now, what is this pentecostal blessing? It's the confirmation of the resurrection. No wonder the Gospel Itself means "good news." Good news of what? He has raised from the dead. "And because I live, ye live also." Ye which were once dead in sin and trespasses, God has quickened us together, by that Spirit that raised up Jesus from the dead. And we are now setting in Heavenly places with Him, communing with Him, talking with Him. What a joy to tell people that story, that believes it to be the Truth! [Romans 8:11], [John 14:19]

L-44 I'm wondering, today. It's what's happening. Are we really getting the people to God? Are we just getting them to church? We must get them to Christ, where this quickening power. It's good to go to church. Sure. If that's as far as we go, it's not far enough. When you come to church, that's good; but go on to Christ, from the church, because we must receive this quickening power, if we ever expect to be in that general resurrection, because it's the only thing that will ever bring us from the dead. "For if this Spirit that raised up Jesus from the dead dwell in you, It'll also quicken, make, bring to life your mortal bodies." What a promise to us! [Romans 8:11]

L-45 Now notice. The very essence of this resurrection is to tell and to show, and to prove that Jesus has raised up from the dead. He's not dead. He's a living. He lives here. He's in us. "I'll be with you, even in you. A little while and the world seeth Me no more. Yet, ye shall see Me, for I will be with you, even in you, unto the end of the world." [Matthew 28:20], [John 14:19]

L-46 Now, as Christians, we all claim He is alive, or we been quickened from--quickened from life... from death to Life, by His Spirit. And if we haven't been quickened, then we've not been made alive. [Ephesians 2:1]

L-47 Now we're going to break into this subject, the Lord willing, and kind of teach it for a few minutes, how that: are we quickened, and can we be sure that this is the Truth?

L-48 Now, this is your own life, this is my life. It's where that the... If this isn't Truth, what I'm fixing to say, then I'm one of the most foolish people in the world. I've give my life for something there's nothing to, and so have you. But if it is the Truth, then I owe everything that I am. I owe everything that I could be, to the cause, of which we're standing for. And I think that we mustn't lose our enthusiasm.

L-49 And as we see Easter approaching, it just does something down in me, as I--I know that that's the day that the thing was sealed forever, in the sight of God.

L-50 Now, we notice, it's the same Spirit that raised Him from the grave, that is dwelling in us. Now, how could that be? The Spirit that raised up, God, Jesus from the dead, has dwelling in us. [Romans 8:11]

L-51 Now, now, is the Spirit that quickens. It's not the Word that quickens. It's the Spirit that quickens the Word, or gives the Word Life, gives It wings to fly, gives It access. It's the Spirit that does that. [Romans 8:11]

L-52 Now, the wheat, alone, is just a wheat; but when the quickening life gets into it, into the wheat, then it gives it life. And we which were once dead, made in the image of God, and yet dead in sin and trespass, there's some way God had to get this quickening Life into your mortal bodies. I'm talking about your body. [Ephesians 2:1]

L-53 Now, Jesus was the Word. You believe that, don't you? [Congregation says, "Amen."--Ed.] "In the beginning..." Saint John 1, "In the beginning was the Word, the Word was with God, and the Word was God. And the Word was made flesh and dwelt among us." [John 1:1, 14]

L-54 Now, as the promised Messiah, He quickened every Word that was prophesied that He would do; heal the sick, and how He would be born of a virgin, all that, made it. It's true. He was the Word, manifested here on earth, but He could not do this just as a Man. It taken the Spirit of God, dwelling in Him, to quicken these promises to Him. I hope that we get this real clear now. Jesus, being a Man, Himself, the body, but it took the Spirit in Him, the Spirit. "It's not 65-0410, The Easter Seal, Ramada Inn, Phoenix, AZ, 137 min Me that doeth the works. It's My Father that dwelleth in Me. He's the One that does the works." See? Jesus Himself was the Word, because He was. Before God... [John 14:10]

L-55 This is a bad word to use, and I hope you take it right, before a crowd. But He was predestinated by the foreknowledge of God, how God's plan was to be, that He would send a Redeemer, and this Redeemer could only be His Own Son. So, then, that was God's promise, all the way from the garden of Eden, that Jesus would be here. Here He was as a Man, born of a virgin, but it taken the Spirit of God to quicken that Word to Him. And He was the Word, quickened, the Word quickened for that hour. The time had come when you had to have a Redeemer. The law had failed. Other things had failed. Now, it takes a Redeemer, and He was the promised Redeemer. He was quickened by the Word of God. [Romans 8:28-30]

L-56 And now if that same Spirit that was upon Him to be the Redeemer in that age, that we have accepted now the promise of in this last days, what would take place; if you become part of that Word, you are redeemed with Him, because the same Spirit that dwelt in Christ is dwelling in you, quickening your life to this age. And It'll also, in the end time, quicken your mortal bodies, resurrect them, bring them up again. That takes the gloom away when we look at it, in that. And that's the Truth. See? [Romans 8:11]

L-57 Romans here, Paul has proved it to us. See? "If the Spirit that raised up Jesus from the dead dwells in you, it will also quicken your mortal bodies." This is the same Spirit that raised Him up, that quickened the true believer to Eternal Life. The Spirit that raised up Jesus from the dead dwells into the believer, quickens the believer to Eternal Life. [Romans 8:11]

L-58 There's only one Life, one Eternal Spirit, one Eternal Life, and that's God. God, alone, is the Eternal. And then we, being His children, are part of Him, that is, the attributes of His thinking. And the thought is expressed and becomes a word. Then, each individual in here, that possesses this Eternal Life, was before the foundation of the world, in God's thinking. It's the only way it could be, 'cause you're a attribute. That's an expression of a thought, has become a Word; and a Word has taken Life, and it's Eternal. That's the reason we have Eternal Life. In the same principle that the great Son of God, the Redeemer; we become sons and daughters of God, through that same Spirit, by the same foreknowledge of God. [John 10:27-28], [Romans 6:23]

L-59 Look at the millions on earth that didn't receive It when Jesus was here. But how thankful that we should be this morning, to know that we have the direct evidence and the Bible proofs, that we are included in that great resurrection morning coming, that great Easter. We have the earnest of it, right now in our mortal bodies. The predestinated ones are the first, of course, to be quickened, when the Holy Spirit comes to claim Its own. [Romans 8:29]

L-60 Now, there's a great statement, and I want my minister brothers to try to understand this. See? In the beginning, God, the great Spirit, He wasn't even "God" then. He was the Eternal One. God is an "object of worship." He had nothing to worship Him. There was no--there was no Angels, no nothing. Just God alone, Him alone, is Eternal. But, in order to be God, there had to be something to worship Him, so He created Angels, and Beings, and Cherubims, and so forth, to worship Him. His great plan begin to unfold. [Genesis 1:1-5]

L-61 But remember, you, in the--the statue that you are in, this morning, if you wasn't in His thinking then, you're not now. For you, there's some part that's in you, that's Eternal, and Eternal only belongs to God. And in God was His thinking of you setting right where you are now. In His thinking, I stood at the pulpit this morning, because He's infinite and knows all things. Therefore He could tell the end from the beginning, because He is Eternal. And you, being a son of God or a daughter of God, then you were in His thinking at the beginning. [John 6:37], [Ephesians 1:4]

L-62 And then when the Holy Spirit come, and you're on earth, walking around here as a sinner, way down in your life there is something. You don't know what's taking place, but you're hungry. I heard the Presbyterian brother; I heard the--the Baptist talking about, back there, he was a--a Freewill Baptist, preaching where he can. My fellow brother, that you, there's something in you, something that you never put in there. It's something that you couldn't desire to be in there. It's something that's contrary to your own nature. It's the foreknowledge of God, taking place, God's Word. [Matthew 5:6], [I Peter 1:2] 65-0410, The Easter Seal, Ramada Inn, Phoenix, AZ, 137 min

L-63 And Jesus was born the Son of God, to be Emmanuel, God's full expression in a Man. And He found Him in perfect obedience, down at the River of Jordan, being baptized by that prophet. And as soon as He obeyed Him, and walked out of the water, the Heavens opened to John. And he saw the Holy Ghost descending from Heaven, saying, "This is My beloved Son." See? Perfect obedience, the Spirit had sought Him out, in obedience. [Matthew 3:13, 16-17], [Matthew 1:23]

L-64 Oh, wayward man or woman, this morning, when you're setting here, and there's something in you telling you This is right, it's the Holy Spirit seeking you out, to bring you to a knowledge of Truth of this hour that we're now living, not some hour that's gone by, the hour now. [John 8:32]

L-65 There was thousands there that had obeying an hour passed. But there was a present-tense hour, that was the hour that Jesus was to appear, and there stood the Word. There stood the people. And here was the manifestation of God taking place, to vindicate that that was the Truth.

L-66 And as pentecostal people, today, let me say this, that we're standing in this last days where God promised He'd pour out His Spirit upon all flesh, and His sons and daughters should prophesy. For He said, "These signs shall follow them that believe." It's the hour. That's what makes that creation in you. [Acts 2:17], [Mark 16:17]

L-67 As I spoke here, not long ago, it sounded a little sacrilegious; but I hope it don't, to you, this morning. The farmer that set the eagle, or set the hen, and had an eagle egg. Many of you remembers the story of the old eagle giving birth to--to this... Or, the hen giving birth over here to this chicken, or--or--or an egg of an eagle under her chicken feathers. See? It's the atmosphere.

L-68 The Presbyterian church, Methodist church, Baptist church, any of them can bring forth these eagles. Sure. It's the atmosphere that does it. As Dr. Bosworth used to say, "You could take a hen egg and put it over, under a pup, and tie him down, a pup would hatch out a chicken." Why? It's the atmosphere. And when any church or any group that'll assemble themselves together, and pray until they throw away their creeds and things, and look straight in the face of God, it'll bring forth eagles just as certain as I'm standing here.

L-69 That's what I think that this businessmen's group has done, trying to break up the atmosphere. We're getting too clannish. One belongs to this and that. Let's break up the atmosphere and get the atmosphere in a Heavenly worship. Get the atmosphere right, eagles will be born, and--and out of any church, anywhere.

L-70 And this little eagle walked with the hen for a long time, but the--the clucking was kind of strange. He didn't understand what the hen meant when she scratched in the--the--the waste of the manure piles in--in the yards. And that wasn't food, to him. And she eat bugs, and so forth, that an eagle doesn't eat. So it seemed strange, all, to him. And he was an ugly duckling, he was. Not saying this sacrilegious. Maybe he was a Freewill Baptist, and, but something on that order, or a Presbyterian.

L-71 But, you know, one day his mother knew that she had laid an egg. There had to be a child somewhere. So she throwed her big wings into the winds, and she searched and she searched, screaming to the top of her voice. And one day, she passed over the barnyard. And when this little eagle heard this familiar scream, he had never heard it before, but he realized that it fit him like a glove over a hand. And he knew that was his mother. She knew that was her son. She was looking for him.

L-72 So has God, in every age, ordained His Church for that age, a Message for that age. And they could have laws and anything that they want to. But when that hour comes, the Holy Spirit of God, which was at the beginning thought out and spoke out for that age, that Spirit hunts that egg. And when he hears that Message, there is no church denomination going to hold it. It'll rise to the heights. It's got to. It's a different bird. It's a different creature. He's an eagle, and he'll hear the scream. "My sheep hear My Voice." As someone said, Brother Williams, "Sheep Food." [John 10:4-5, 27]

L-73 "My sheep hear My Voice. A stranger they will not follow." No matter how loyal the church has been, and how much its big of name it's got. "When My sheep hear My Voice," which is the Word, "a stranger they will not follow." They'll go right straight to that Word, and can do it. It's like a--a--a magnet. [John 10:4-5, 27] 65-0410, The Easter Seal, Ramada Inn, Phoenix, AZ, 137 min

L-74 One day, up in Indiana, I was visiting them steel mills, and the whistle blowed. And everybody took off their aprons, and begin to sweep the... out from their lathes, out into the middle the floor, the shavings that they had made through the day. And I was walking along with the man that was taking me through, and he said, "Watch this." And so every man laid his--his bench dress up on the--up on the table, walked away.

L-75 Way back in the back, he touched a little button. And here come a big magnet through, and it picked up every bit of that iron that was shaved off of those pieces, now, and went out. It demagnetized it; it dropped into a cupola. And was melted over, for another piece of--of goods, the same thing, axles or whatever they were building.

L-76 And I stood there and looked at that, till I--I just lost myself. And I said, "I'm wondering something." He said, "What is it, sir?" And I said, "I notice that some of that didn't go up."

L-77 He said, "It's aluminum, and the magnet is not magnetized to the aluminum." I said, "I see." And he said... Then I said, "Well, you notice, there is a piece of iron laying across." "But, you see, sir, it was bolted down." I said, "I see." And when he took it out, I said, "Now what happens, that out there?" Says, "It goes right back into the mill, poured out through the cupola, and comes right back and makes another wheel." I said, "Praise the Lord!" That's it. See?

L-78 There is a great magnet setting in the sky, that God one day will touch His fingers to. No man knows the time He's Coming, not even the Angels of Heaven, doesn't know. God alone knows. But there has been some trimmings that's come off of the Bible, Bible Christians, believers for this hour. One of them might have been an axle back in another day. This might be some other part. It's going on to make the big regime of God. But it'll be molded into the pot of God's great cupola, and poured out again into the images of God. And just those who are magnetized to it will be taken up. Oh, how to... What a privilege it is, to know that there is something in the resurrection that's pertaining to us! [Matthew 24:36], [Romans 8:29]

L-79 Now, notice, recognize the call of God's Word, which is a part of. And it's an eagle to an eagle. Now, if that mother would have screamed like a--a buzzard, he'd have never knowed it. He'd been just as well off in the barnyard. But it was the scream of an eagle. There was something inside that little fellow, that he knowed he was an eagle. [John 10:24-29]

L-80 And the same thing is with every true believer. When the preaching of God's Word comes forth, and is vindicated and proved that it's God's Word for this hour, then there's Something within the believer. I don't care how loyal his father was to a church, or how loyal his mother was, or his grandparents, and if the church is teaching contrary to this hour of the baptism of the Holy Ghost Message. There's something in him that screams out. He'll leave the barnyard. He's got to do it. The chicken might have been all right one day, but this is eagle hour. See? It--it's a different. There is something, that, he must leave the old coop and fly away into the blue. Then this earthly body is quickened and brought, by the quickening Spirit, to the obedience of God's Word. [John 6:63]

L-81 Now, when this Holy Spirit, represented as the eagle flying over the land, and finds the believer. "No man can come to Me, no man can come to Me as he wants to. All the Father has given Me will come to Me, but no man can come by himself." It isn't your own thinking, your own drawing. It's God, drawing. See? "All the Father has given Me will come to Me." [John 17:9], [John 6:44], [John 6:37, 65]

L-82 Now, the Holy Spirit is here on earth, looking out those individuals that God has ordained to Life in this age. And as soon as It finds it, It does just like It did on Jesus Christ, the great super Son of God Who redeemed us all. It comes down and takes Its place of abode into the human life, now, notice, brought the quickening power. Now, that quickening power that come upon Jesus quickened Him to manifest every promise of the Word of that day. So does the Holy Spirit that come upon us in this day, if it's not a mockery holy spirit, you're not the Devil mocking the Holy Spirit, but is the real, true Holy Spirit. It'll manifest the promise of this hour. [Acts 13:48], [Ephesians 2:1-2], [Colossians 2:13], [Romans 8:10-15] 65-0410, The Easter Seal, Ramada Inn, Phoenix, AZ, 137 min

L-83 When It fell upon Luther, It manifested that promise of that hour. When It fell upon Wesley, It manifested the promise of that hour. When It falls in this day, It manifests the promise of this hour. When It fell upon Moses, It manifested the promise of that hour. Fell upon Noah, It manifest the promise of that hour. When It fell upon Jesus, It manifest the promise of that hour. See? [Colossians 1:26]

L-84 It's the Holy Spirit coming down, to quicken, make alive those people that's foreordained of God to be in the Rapture. Notice. That is, if he is a true eagle, he will understand the Message of the hour if he's a true eagle. Now, the little eagle probably, in the barnyard, was eating all right, but he--he knowed it wasn't just exactly right. But then when he heard the Truth, then he received this Truth. Now, in John 14... [Romans 8:11], [I Peter 1:20]

L-85 John 5:24, rather, Jesus said, speaking this way, "He that heareth My Words, and believeth on Him that sent Me, hath everlasting Life, and shall not come into the judgment, but is passed from death unto Life." Just think how simple that is, "He that believeth." Now, the correct way of saying that, "He that understandeth." [John 5:24]

L-86 Now, you go out here on the street and say to this prostitute, "You believe?" "Sure." "You believe He's Son of God?" "Certainly." "Been baptized?" "Sure."

L-87 Go down to the drunkard, say, "You hear That? Hear that preacher preach?" "Yeah." "You believe That?" "Sure." See?

L-88 But, "He that understandeth, he that knoweth his place in this hour, he that heareth My Word and believeth on Him that sent Me, hath" (present tense) "Eternal Life. Shall not come into the Judgment, but has already passed from death unto Life." Then when this new Eternal Life dwells in you, It is the potential, or the earnestness of you being quickened from mortal to immortality. [John 5:24]

L-89 Let me say that again. When This Spirit has found you, the individual, and has come upon you, It is the potential of your Eternal inheritance that God thought of you and made for you before the foundation of the world. That is your potential. [Matthew 25:34], [Ephesians 1:4-5]

L-90 Like if you asked me for an oak tree, and I give you an acorn. Now, the--the--the life for the oak tree is in the acorn now, but you have to wait till it grows up.

L-91 So do we. When you receive the Holy Spirit of God, It's God's potential waiting upon you, that's already recognized you. And you're sealed by the Spirit of promise, of God, into the Body of Christ. When God looked down at Calvary and seen Jesus dying, He not... Oh! He died for His Bride, the Body, which is the Word Church, the Church that believes the Word of God for the age, whether it's feet, body, head, or wherever it is. See? It's... Christ was bleeding and dying. And God, looking upon Him, saw His resurrection, and the Church raised with Him on Easter. [Romans 14:9], [I Thessalonians 4:14]

L-92 Now, I want you to get all this together, 'cause I got something here in a little bit, I want to say, the Lord willing.

L-93 Now notice. It's the earnest, or the potential, the quickening power of your resurrection, when you receive the Holy Spirit. Is then dwelling in you, the potential of it. [Ephesians 1:10-14]

L-94 Notice, you--you are now on your way, growing to the full resurrection. No tree just comes up overnight. It's got to grow, as we grow in the grace and knowledge of God. You are baptized into the Holy Spirit. Now, as the pentecostal Church, baptized into the Holy Spirit, It's begin growing. Limbs has died. They was pruning them off. But the Tree is still growing, is still going on, because It's got to come to the resurrection. [II Peter 3:18]

L-95 They're led by the Spirit, to quicken the Word to you who is believers. The Word keeps quickening, as you come 65-0410, The Easter Seal, Ramada Inn, Phoenix, AZ, 137 min to first limb, second limb, third limb, on up. It just keeps quickening. The Spirit of God keeps quickening to you.

L-96 Notice that, Pentecost, their bodies were quickened by the new Life they received. That makes me feel religious. Think. Now, here was men, fishermen, tax collectors, the humble little women of... and just ordinary housewives, little virgin girls. They were believers. They were believing that this was the Truth. They believed that, when Jesus died. They believed on Him. And rose up again, from the dead; they believed that to be the absolutely testimony of God, that He had quickened Him to life.

L-97 Now, they go up, to the Day of Pentecost, to receive their abstract. Do you know what an abstract is? Is when a deed has been cleared. They went up there to receive their abstract. And they become quickened, or what a thrill! They had bought the land; been bought for them. They had received it. [John 6:63]

L-98 Is it true or not? "We seen Him raise up, but now what about us? We are witnesses. We stood and seen the Man crucified. We seen the clouds come over the earth and darken the skies. And the--the earth quaked and shook; it had nervous prostration. Then when... They put Him in the grave. They speared Him in the heart, with the spear, and they took His body down and laid it in the grave of Joseph Arimathaea. [Matthew 27:35, 54], [John 19:34], [Luke 23:50-52], [Matthew 27:57-60]

L-99 And then they find out, that, on the third day, He raised up again. And as the disciple said, "We are witnesses of this. We seen Him raise up. We know He's alive." [Matthew 17:23], [Luke 24:6], [Mark 16:6]

L-100 Now what did that do? That took all the fear out. No wonder Jesus said, "Fear not. I'm He that was dead, and is alive forevermore." See? It taken all the fear out, when they did that. [Revelation 1:17-18], [Acts 2:1-4]

L-101 Now, but when they went up to Pentecost, there they received the quickening power, the power that made them alive.

L-102 Now there's where I think that, you Presbyterian and Methodist brethren, you do receive potentially on believing on the Lord Jesus Christ, but the abstract hasn't come yet. That's the clearing of the deed.

L-103 God gave Abraham a promise. Abraham believed God, and it was imputed unto him for righteousness. But He sealed the covenant by the seal of circumcision. [Romans 4:11]

L-104 And God gives you a promise, potentially, that you will receive it, and you're going to be raised up, this body is going to be glorified with Him at the end time. But, you see, you have to get a clearance on that deed. And the clearance is when everything against it has been stricken off, and you got the abstract to it. You've got the seal. It's yours. Everything is on it belongs to you. Amen.

L-105 And when we believe on Jesus Christ for our Saviour, and repent and are baptized, and come up to believe Him; God recognizes our repentance and our faith towards Him, and sends down the abstract. And the abstract is the assurance. It's the guarantee that, everything was ever held against you, you thoroughly repented. Hallelujah! And the property is boughten, and you hold the abstract for the assurance. [Acts 2:38]

L-106 Let somebody try to put you off the land, say he belongs, and you with the abstract in your hand. Let him try to do it. There ain't a law in the land can do it, because you hold the abstract.

L-107 And there's no devil, no church, or any theology, that can overstep the boundaries of God's proof and abstract, that the baptism of the Holy Ghost has recognized us in Jesus Christ. We're just as sure to raise as He raised, because potentially we have already raised in Him. Amen.

L-108 The old things. What does it do to our mortal bodies? It turns our opinion, changes our notions. It sets our affections on things which are Above. And the smoking, drinking, gambling, the things that you used to do, is dead. It's beneath you. [Colossians 3:2]

L-109 And you are quickened. And this quickening power brings your body into a raptured condition, already. Notice the pentecostal people up there, when they got quickened by the Holy Spirit. Listen to me. When those pentecostal group up there, on the Day of Pentecost, received their abstract deed from God, sure, it glorified their souls. They screamed. They saw tongues of Fire separated upon each of them. And it so quickened their body, till they couldn't 65-0410, The Easter Seal, Ramada Inn, Phoenix, AZ, 137 min even speak in an earthly language anymore. It quickened their body to a Heavenly language, the Place they're going to. Quickening power of God shook their mortal bodies so, till their entire mortal language was transfigured, transformed into an immortal language. What a quickening power! What? Something that belongs. [Acts 2:3]

L-110 "If the Spirit that raised up Jesus from the dead, dwells in your mortal bodies, It shall also quicken your mortal bodies." We are quickened then by the power of the living God. [Romans 8:11]

L-111 Tongues, quickened to a new Heavenly language, to speak to them; a rapturing up, raising up into a different atmosphere than what they had ever lived in. Also, with the new quickening Life to them, that come in them, It quickened their language. They spoke in new tongues. Oh, yes!

L-112 Now watch them. It also was designed to give them, after this abstract, it was designed to give them every promise that was on the grounds. Every promise on the grounds of God's Word, that was promised in the Bible, that quickening power was give to them, to quicken that promise to them. Therefore, they laid hands on the sick, they was healed. They spoke in new tongues. They done great signs and wonders, because that was in God's promise. And when Jesus died, to redeem that back to them, the grounds that belonged to sons of God, He demonstrated what God was. [Mark 16:17], [Acts 10:46], [Hebrews 2:4]

L-113 How dare we to socialize that and put it into an organization? We have no rights to do that.

L-114 It's the Holy Spirit, today, hunting out honest hearts that will believe that Message. Everything in the Bible, that was promised, is to that believer. And when you accept it in its fulness, and God knows that you'll do it, He gives you the abstract to that. And then every promise that's made is in your possession, and the Holy Spirit is there to quicken that to you. Oh, my! What--what kind of people should we be? How wonderful to see the God's great Holy Spirit here to do that power! Think of it. When, the Holy Ghost Itself, here to bear record of this hour. Jesus said so. He's the same yesterday, today, and forever. How dare any man to wipe that out of There? [Hebrews 13:8]

L-115 "The works that I do shall you do also," John 14:12. "These signs shall follow them that believe." That is the assurance. When we see a group of people setting together, and those signs manifesting themselves, that's the assurance that the abstract is there to vindicate that that's property of God. Amen. [John 14:12], [Mark 16:17]

L-116 So, we are Easter, also. Amen. We are now in our Easter. We've already raised, hallelujah, from the things of the world, to the things of God's promise. Not we will; we are. It's the potentials.

L-117 It's God's promise. He'd pour out His Spirit in the last days, and that's what they would do. Notice, laid their hands on the sick; everything that was in God's promise. "I shall pour out My Spirit in the last days, upon all flesh. Your old men shall dream dreams. Your young men shall see visions." And all these different promises that He made, everything is laying right there in God's promise. Jesus redeemed it to us. And when we become... [Acts 2:17]

L-118 Or, we, if we are ordained on that ground, if we are ordained to be on that ground; like the eagle walking in the chicken's nest. If you're ordained on that ground, the Holy Spirit is here to find you. And when It finds you, you recognize Its call. You know the hour you're living. You know that these things are supposed to happen. Quickly you're raptured up to meet It, and now you're setting in Heavenly places in Christ Jesus. Oh, what a promise! What a Heavenly Father, Who would give us these things! [Ephesians 1:3, 20], [Ephesians 2:6]

L-119 The Spirit quickens their fellowship with God, so that they call the dead back to life, in that day. They laid their bodies upon the dead; they come to life. Listen closely. They done the same things that Jesus did because the same Spirit, was upon Him, was upon them. If one Spirit makes a man act this way, it makes the other one act that way. If one... [Acts 9:40, 41]

L-120 How can This come upon, say he's got the Spirit of God, and deny the works of God? Cannot do it.

L-121 Notice. God's Life, which is in the Greek called Zoe, moving through them and in them, quickened their minds to His Word. Now, let me say it real quietly now. The Spirit of God that moves among the people, quickens the mind of the person to the promise of God. See? It does it. Look. And I'm trying to show you the--the... and let you realize that 65-0410, The Easter Seal, Ramada Inn, Phoenix, AZ, 137 min I'm speaking now of the Church, and also quickened to Life, in Him.

L-122 Although, they only was His attributes, to begin with. But if God said, "In this day," back in the beginning, "John Doe will be My servant," millions of years ago. Now, John Doe is born in sin, shaped in iniquity, come to the world speaking lies, because he's a mortal. But, maybe, he gets a little religious feeling. He'll go join a church. Maybe he'll join Pentecostal church. Don't know. He might join anything. But let him get under the atmosphere of God, once. See? John Doe is bound to recognize Who his Father is, just as that eagle recognized who the mother was. It's got to realize it. See? Only, that John Doe is God's attribute that's become a word, spoken, and then the Holy Spirit seeks that word out. Here it is. He calls him, gives him everlasting Life, and brings him into the Presence of God, God's Word. [Psalms 51:5], [Psalms 58:3]

L-123 Look. God had the same when He saw Jesus. It was the--it was the finished work that God finished with Jesus, when He said, "It's finished." All the plan was finished. [John 19:30]

L-124 And when the Spirit of God comes upon you, and you truly are one of God's attributes that He spoken of. Now, if you're not, you'll wonder and flusterate, and run here and there, and everything else, and never come to the knowledge of the Truth. [Blank.spot.on.tape--Ed.] If you are one of those, the old things pass away right quick, see, and you become new, and the plan of salvation is finished. You're ready to obey every Word that God ever spoke of you, see, for you to do. You're submissive to His Word. The contract, exactly, the abstract to the contract, the title deed belongs to you. The debts are all paid. It's all struck off, and as it was at the Day of Pentecost. [II Timothy 3:7]

L-125 Now let us notice the quickening, this quickening Spirit on other people.

L-126 Now, I told you I wouldn't speak very long, and I just got twenty minutes to keep my word, if I do that, notice, to keep in what time I said, about--about an hour. Notice now this quickening power. That only comes...

L-127 Now, there's a lot of mockery of It. There is a lot of people that really think they got It, when they haven't. Lot of people do it because they have got some false impression of what they seen other Christians do. Satan can impersonate any of that. We know that. And as missionaries, you can see it impersonated: shouting, dancing, speaking in tongues, all these things. You can see it impersonated anywhere. Absolutely. Amongst heathens and people who deny there is such a thing as Jesus Christ being the Son of God. See? And they do all those things, themself.

L-128 But the real, true quickening Spirit that comes to a believer, quickens him to God's Word, that's back to eagle Food again, right back to where he lives. "Man shall not live by bread alone, but by every Word that proceedeth out of the mouth of God." [Matthew 4:4]

L-129 Let us now notice this quickening Spirit as It come upon other people, like It did on--on the Day of Pentecost.

L-130 Let's notice Pentecost, how they acted, and see if they were quickened by this quickening power that we're talking about. On the Day of Pentecost, they were all waiting up there. In themselves, they were afraid. The Jews, just what they were going to do, so they got scared. But what happened? When this quickening power fell from Heaven, there was a bravery set upon them. There was something, an understanding, where they wasn't too sure of it a few hours before. They knowed He had--He had died. [Acts 2:1]

L-131 They know He had risen. They had talked to Him on the way. "But was that thing for them, or was it just for then, for Jesus Himself?" [Luke 24:32]

L-132 But here on the Day of Pentecost, the Holy Spirit, the abstract fell upon the believers. That made them part of His resurrection, made him part of His fellowship. The Holy Spirit came and confirmed to them that they would be raised up, because they were potentially raised then, from cowards to brave men.

L-133 They were--they were afraid of the very Word that they had thought. Don't let this pass over you. They were afraid. They knowed that He was that Word.

L-134 Even the Jews had to admit it. Nicodemus said, "Rabbi, we know that You're a teacher that come from God. No man could do the things you do except God be with Him. Now, we know that. We recognize that." [John 3:2] 65-0410, The Easter Seal, Ramada Inn, Phoenix, AZ, 137 min

L-135 So the disciples... Peter had even sworn in His Presence. All of them had forsaken Him at the crucifixion.

L-136 But here they are now up in this upper room, in the Presence of God. Then, all of a sudden, here come this Holy Spirit down from Heaven, and It quickened them. And the quickening took place, they wasn't afraid to make a witness of the Message that they believed and knowed to be the Truth. Otherwise, they were afraid of It.

L-137 How many Presbyterians, how many Methodists, how many Baptists, in the world today, how many Pentecostals, that knows the Truth and afraid to make a stand on the It? I'm persuaded to wonder, what was that fell on you? Are you a part of His resurrection? Would you dare scream off for some man's theory and idea? Or, have you got the real boldness and the--the real manhood it takes, to stand out and call right "right," and wrong "wrong"? Are you a part of His resurrection, or are you a worshiper of a bunch of creeds? Are you a goer to church, do you have your name on there, and dead in sin and trespasses? He that believes not the full Word of God is a sinner.

L-138 Those Pharisees believed in many things, to be the Truth. They said, "We are God's children." And they were, until that Word was preached. But when that Word was preached and vindicated, then they become sinners, for rejecting the Thing that they knowed was right, and witnessed that. "We know Thou art a teacher come from God, for no man could do the things that You do without God being with You." [Ephesians 2:1], [John 3:2]

L-139 I wonder today, where we at? I ask you. Where is this resurrection finding us? Are you dare to step out? Are you dare to take God at His Word? If you're ordained to Life, you sure will do it. If you're an eagle, you can't help doing it, there is Something in you. Or, do you want just serve a creed somewhere, say, "I go to church. I'm just as good as you are"? See? If you hold no birthrights, you'll never see it, you can't see it. But if you do hold the possession of this birthright, you can't help from seeing it, because it's part of you and you're a part of it.

L-140 How could I deny the mother that give me birth? How could I deny the father, that his own blood is in me? How could I deny Charles Branham from being my father? I could not do it. I'm willing to stand his reproach or anything else, because I am his son. Hallelujah!

L-141 Then being a son of God, and He was the Word of God, how can I deny that Bible being Truth, that Jesus Christ isn't the same yesterday, today, and forever? And seeing the hour that we're living in, we need an Easter in the church. Resurrection! We need a resurrection, to power faith, men and women to stand out for that which is God's vindicated Word.

L-142 Say, "Well, we having our Youth for Christ." That's all right. "Our church is having a meeting. We want so many members." Nothing against that. That's all right. But that's only the atmosphere. That might be an old hen's feathers. But if you'll get in the right atmosphere there, it'll hatch eagle if you're an eagle egg. And if you were foreordained of God to see it, you can't help from seeing it, you're coming forth in a resurrection. That's the way the Baptist was born, that's the way the Methodist was born, in a resurrection of that day, but they turned off to a hen instead of an eagle. [Romans 8:29]

L-143 As I said not long ago, going down from Tucson. I watched a very strange thing. I seen a hawk setting on the wire down there. That hawk has long lost its identification. It used to be a bird next to the eagle. It could not follow the eagle; no, by no means. Nothing can follow an eagle. But he was a hawk.

L-144 Christ is the Eagle, and the church should at least be a hawk. They can fly higher than any other rest the birds. But that hawk has become soft. It's lost its identification. He sets on the telephone wires and waits for some dead rabbit. He hops like a vulture, in the stead of flying like a hawk.

L-145 Oh, my brother, sister, you Pentecostal people, which is my own dear people! The church is losing its identification. It's coming down and depending on some dead formal creed, instead of flying in the Heavenlies, yonder, for fresh manna.

L-146 A hawk used to hunt his own manna, but today he takes what the automobiles run over and what the vultures eat. He hops like one. He looks like one. 65-0410, The Easter Seal, Ramada Inn, Phoenix, AZ, 137 min

L-147 We so adorned ourselves in the modern world, our women cutting their hair, and wearing shorts, our men with not enough backbone to stand in the pulpit and tell the truth. We've long got soft on the Word.

L-148 O God, send the Holy Ghost and look out them eagles somewhere, that's ready to stand yonder, no matter what takes place, that'll soar into the unknown, not set on the telephone wires and look for some Sunday school literature to come in. Let me have the Word, and in the freshness of the power and demonstration of the Holy Ghost. We need an Easter, a resurrection that's potentials. My friend, if you're satisfied with such a carrion of the world, there's something wrong.

L-149 My sister, my brother, let me say to you, this, in godly fear, knowing that I may never live to see an Easter again. But there's one thing sure, when a genuine foreordained son of God, by the Word of God, hears that Voice of God, he'll rise and go to meet It. It's the potentials, that he's going to meet the real living Word. As He was, the Bride will meet the Groom. She's a part of His Body.

L-150 Notice, long have we, we're losing our identifications. We come on Wednesday night, some of us. Others stay home to watch Who Loves Susie, televisions, all kinds of worldly things, all kinds of entertainments, to keep you away from church. Long have we lost it.

L-151 Our seminaries, our schools, are putting out a bunch of rickies with a whole lot of theology, and--and entertainment and everything in the church, to take the place of the prayer meeting. We've took dress and try to fulfill what the modernist try to do, bring them in. You'll never win them by that. They got more of that than you have. You ain't got no business on your ground... on their ground. Let them come over on yours, where the real baptism is shining, where the real power of the resurrection. Don't try to build a church like theirs. Don't try to have a pastor like that. Don't try to do this other, or cooperate with the world. They shine with Hollywood.

L-152 The real Gospel glows with power. Eagles hear that. They don't look for a shine. They look for a glow. Glowing with humility, glowing with love, glowing with power, that's what the real eagle hunts. You can't scratch in a barnyard and please him. He'll never be able to do it. You'll never tell it to him, because he don't believe it.

L-153 Let that Voice scream from the Heaven, "I am He that was dead, and alive again." Something takes place. "I am the same yesterday, today, and forever. And it shall come to pass in the last days, I'll pour out of Myself upon all's flesh." Glory to God! "I'll quicken your mortal language. I'll quicken your mortal tongues. I'll give you the evidence that I'm going to bring you in the resurrection with Me." Hungry-hearted eagles reach for that just as hard as they can. It's the Pearl of great price, that they sell everything else, to go buy. Amen. [Hebrews 13:8], [Revelation 1:18], [Acts 2:16-17]

L-154 God help us, friend. Our churches are losing their identification.Let's quickly now go to some. [Acts 2:17]

L-155 Watch the action of those disciples, a scared. They knowed Jesus was the Truth, but, you see, It was against the popular idea, the popular religion of the hour, the most strictest religion, Sar-... Pharisees, Sadducees, and so forth, their cults, clans, and denominations. They were--they were against That, "Heresy." But Jesus was the identified Word.

L-156 And Jesus is the Holy Ghost, in Spirit. "A little while and the world seeth Me no more. You shall see Me," not the body; the Life that was in Him. God is upon the Church, to call sons like He did then, obedient. [John 14:19]

L-157 "I always do that which is pleasing to My Father. Which one of you can accuse Me of Sin?" Other words, sin is "unbelief." "What has the Word said about Me, that I haven't done?" There it is. "Show Me what the Word said that I'd do, that I didn't do. Which one can accuse Me? Which one can lay your fingers on Me, and say that I haven't fulfilled My Father's Word?" Oh, when the Pentecostal church gets to that spot! "Who can accuse Me of unbelief?"

L-158 Oh, Christians, be identified not as a hawk, but an eagle. That hawk is soft, it'll come down. You never see an eagle doing that. He'll never do that. He hunts his own food, out of the blue. God's prepared him so he can see it. He gets fresh manna, not something that's dead.

L-159 In the Hebrews, when they crossed through the wilderness, they eat, tried to eat dead manna. It had become stagnant. It had--it had wiggletails in it. You know what we mean. It's just contaminated, rotten. Maggots is in it. [John 65-0410, The Easter Seal, Ramada Inn, Phoenix, AZ, 137 min 6:49, 58]

L-160 Why would I eat a food that had been dead years ago? It might be in form and shape, but it isn't fresh. We got to get food every generation, new. So does the eagle look for that food, every generation, as we're in our journey. Notice.

L-161 Now let's take some people again. Let's take some of the Old Testament prophets, see what they did.

L-162 Let's look first at Stephens, how Stephens in the midst of that Sanhedrin Council. When that council brought him up there, that great assembly of believers there, or supposed to be believers, brought him up and tried to condemn him. "Why," he said, "you stiffnecks, uncircumcised in heart and ears, you always resist the Holy Ghost." That's that Eternal Life. "As your fathers did it back yonder through the prophets, so are you doing it today." And they gnashed upon him with their teeth. They didn't want to hear that. He was against their creed. He was against their denomination. And they stoned the man to death. And he raised his hands up, looked towards Heaven, say, "I see heavens open, and Jesus standing at the right side." Why? He had the resurrection, quickening power in him, that took him into the bosoms of Jesus. [Acts 7:51], [Acts 7:56, 59]

L-163 Notice, quickly now. Look at Philip, down there in a great revival. Having a revival where it had been daresn't for any man, why, if he had got a big cooperation amongst the churches and everything down there. Was having a great revival. And the quickening power of God spoke to him, said, "Stephen..." May It said this, "You're having a great revival, but I got one man I want you to talk to."

L-164 And Stephen is obedient, no matter what it is, how much criticism. "Oh, Stephen's, you can't leave." "But, I can. God said so."

L-165 And he went out into the desert, and out there he found this eunuch. And what happened? He said, "Has... If thou believest with all thy heart, that Jesus is the Son of God, I'll baptize you." When he baptized him... [Acts 8:36-37]

L-166 Look. He was quickened by this quickening power, to leave a revival of thousands of people, to go out into the desert, to one man. Oh, that would be against all reasons. See? "Why, there's ten thousand wanting you here." But there's one wanting, out there. See? And the quickening power sent him to God's provided place. Hallelujah!

L-167 Men and women, It'll make you stand to your feet. It'll make you do the things that God wants you to do. I don't care what somebody else says about it. The neighbor say, "Oh, that person has lost their mind. Pray all night; they read the Bible." I don't care what they say. It's what God called you to do. That's right. "Oh, they say we can't have these old fashion, Pentecostal revivals." Oh, yes, we can, too. You can have it in yourself. And you are the majority, in God, no matter what the rest of them think.

L-168 Notice, after, in obedience. Listen close now. After obeying God, to His Word, when he fulfilled his mission, that quickening power that he received at Pentecost caught him away, quickened his body. Miles and miles away, he was taken in the Spirit, and was found over in another country somewhere. Quickening power of God! And if we be pentecostals, "That same power that raised up Jesus from the dead, if It dwells in your mortal bodies." See? All right. Notice. [Acts 8:39-40]

L-169 Let's take another man with this quickening power. There was a man way long ago, by the name of Enoch. When a new thing come along, when something come along and said, "Well, now we have to go back to the old school, or this, that, or the other," Enoch walked with God. Whatever God said do, Enoch never missed one word. He walked with God. What was he? He was a son of God. He was an eagle that had been called to that day. [Genesis 5:24]

L-170 And when come time, he was so full of that quickening power! Remember, he had walked five hundred years, or more, before God, and not one time had he missed His Word. Not one time did he misbehave himself. Not one time did he do but kept the testimony. Everything that God told him to do, he went and done it. No argument about it, he just went and done it. No matter what anybody else thought, he went and done it. Why? He was full of that quickening power. And when it come time for the old man to die, God just sent down the ladder and he walked up Home. He quickened him, and took his mortal body up in a rapture. Amen. That's that quickening power.

L-171 Look at Elijah, after his work was finished on earth. He was so full of that quickening power, he condemned them 65-0410, The Easter Seal, Ramada Inn, Phoenix, AZ, 137 min Jackie Kennedy haircuts in his day. He had told old Jezebel what he thought of her. He told them preachers and priests what was right and wrong, and they didn't believe him. But he condemned them painted-faced women and things, so bad. And he so full of that quickening power till nothing could harm him. God had fed him from the heavens, took him out and set him aside. He was so full of quickening power, come time to die, the Jordan opened up, and he just walked, sent down a chariot and took him up Home, so full of that quickening power. He become a true, genuine son of God. Yeah. [I Kings 17:6], [II Kings 2:8, 11],

L-172 Notice, he had a successor, and his name was Elisha. And Elisha had a double portion, this quicken power. See? He had a double portion of it. Now, he preached for about eighty years, or he was about eighty years old. He took sick and died. Now, he didn't get to go Home like Elijah did. See? Both of them is represented there in the Church; some saints go, and some resting. But notice when Elijah was taken up in the rapture; then Elisha went to sleep, in God, full of quickening power. Look at his prophecy just before he died. See? [II Kings 2:9-10]

L-173 Now, let me show you. I don't care if you're dead, or where you're at, that quickening power never leaves. Years and years after his death, his meat had rotted away, the skin worms had eat it up. But they were packing a dead man, one day, throwed him in on that bones, and there was so much quickening power there till the man come back to life again. Hallelujah! Raised him up from the dead, because that quickening power that was upon that saint of God, never left him, stayed right on those bones. [II Kings 13:21]

L-174 Oh, remember, we are flesh of His flesh, bone of His bones, if we are His Bride. Death won't bother that quickening power at all. "Though the skin worms destroys this body, yet in my flesh shall I see God." Glory to God! What a... I don't know what I say. What a hope for an old man like me, knowing I see my end time right out yonder soon, as fifty-six years old. [Job 19:26]

L-175 Since a little bitty boy, I've stood here. I'm trying to proclaim This. But I know, That in me, nothing good that I have, nothing I've done. But in me is that quickening power that quickened me one day from the things of the world, as a young man, unto Eternal Life. Oh, the things that's happened! I've seen visions, foretold things. He never let nothing fail yet. I've spoke in other tongues. I've prophesied. I've done those things by the Spirit of God that dwelt in me. That's quickening power. I know that some day...

L-176 My Redeemer is living now. And some day when He comes, these bones shall rise again, to go to meet Him in the air. You may bury me in the sea, burn it up, wherever you want to. That quickening power is Eternal. Whew! I feel the Easter right now. Yes, sir. I've had it for years. It's in me.

L-177 It's in you. If, you, the Spirit that raised Jesus from the dead dwells in your mortal bodies, It's quickened you from the things of the world, to the Word of God only. It's quickened you from this life to Life Eternal. You who were once dead in sin and trespasses has now been quickened together, to set in Heavenly places with Christ Jesus, feasting on Manna from Above, seeing the hand of God made manifested, prove the promise of this day. [Ephesians 2:1]

L-178 "As it was in the days of Noah, so shall it be in the coming of the Son of man. They were eating, drinking, marrying, given in marrying. And as it was in the days of Lot, so will it be in the hours that the Son of man will be revealed on earth," not Son of God, no more. "Son of man," come back as the prophetic Message for the last day when that eagle will be flying; not the lion; not the ox in the sacrifice age. See? [Luke 17:27, 29]

L-179 Every time, a religious power went forth to meet the challenge of the political power of the world. When the lion raised up, the religious power, it went to meet the Roman power.

L-180 And then when come the sacrifice hour, the ox went, because he's the sacrifice Beast of the Lord.

L-181 Then come the reformers, down through the church ages, come the face of a man. And the reformers had been since Luther, Wesley, oh, Calvin, on down, down, pentecostal age.

L-182 But in the last Message that went forth, there came a flying eagle. It's eagle time, reveal time, the Word of God made manifest, the Word of God proved. Oh, children, walk into this baptism of the Holy Spirit. Come in and believe It, with all your heart, God will fill you. [Matthew 24:28], [Colossians 1:26] 65-0410, The Easter Seal, Ramada Inn, Phoenix, AZ, 137 min

L-183 Looky here now. We find now, remember, "We are flesh of His flesh, and bone of His bone." As God raised His bones and flesh out of the grave, they cannot hide the man that has the potentials. Death cannot take him. Jesus said, "All the Father has given Me will come to Me. I'll raise them up at the last day." Oh, my! Easter! Why, we're right in Easter. When He raised, we raised with Him. He sent the abstract back. We hold it, as the baptism of the Holy Ghost. "He is alive forevermore; the same yesterday, today, and forever." Hebrews 13:8 proves that. He's the same. [John 6:37], [Hebrews 13:8]

L-184 His messianic, anointed ones believe that. What is the messiah? What is the messiah? Messiah is "anointed One." And now if He was the Messiah, by being the anointed One for that day, to fulfill the Word of God, to be the Redeemer and the anointed One, and God raised up that body; His Bride is the anointed one for this day. It's already raised with Him in the resurrection, because, "These two are one." Amen.

L-185 I--I wish I could tell it the way I see it. I wish I had the education I could do it with. See? I--I hope you see it. I hope, God, the Holy Ghost comes down there and puts that in your heart, to see what I mean.

L-186 The resurrection, we are now in the resurrection. We are setting with Him in the resurrection, but only those who have Life.

L-187 Not those who do not have Life. They won't know It. They'll never know It. They'll go right on thinking they're getting the Holy Ghost, being saved, and the Rapture will done be over with and gone. Said, "Elias has already come, and they did that way, and you knew it not." See?

L-188 Notice. Death does not stop the quickening power of God. Notice. Death can't stop it.

L-189 You say, "Well, my mother was a Spirit-filled woman. My daddy, I never seen a man so full of the power as my daddy. But he died, Brother Branham." Sure. That didn't stop the quickening power.

L-190 Moses had that quickening power. You believe that? [Congregation says, "Amen."--Ed.] There never was a man like him on the earth, until Jesus. For he didn't only see visions, he talked face-to-face with God.

L-191 Even a prophetess, Miriam, disputed his word one day. He said, "Don't you fear God? Consider my servant, Moses. There's not nobody in the world like him, this hour. There's never been anybody like Moses. I speak to Moses. What did he ever say, that wasn't truth? See? I speak to Moses. Don't you fear God? Don't you say a word against him." And right then she was stricken with leprosy and--and was dying. She didn't live very long, afterwards. Moses prayed for her. [Numbers 12:1], [Numbers 12:6-8]

L-192 And Moses climbed up on the mountain, at a hundred and twenty years of ministry, or eighty years of ministry; hundred and twenty years of life, climbed up on the mountains and died, and was buried in the valley. But that quickening power was on him. About eight hundred years later, here he is, standing on Mount Transfiguration. Amen. What was he? He was included in that resurrection. Sure, he was. He had the quickening power of God. Here he was, standing. [Matthew 17:1-3], [Mark 9:4]

L-193 Look at Job, Abraham, Isaac, the saints on the day of the resurrection, that great morning that Job and all of them knew that would come. When, he said, "I know my Redeemer liveth," hundreds and hundreds of years before Christ. It's, actually, Book of Job was wrote before Genesis, they claim, the oldest Book in the Bible. [Job 19:25-26]

L-194 And in his trials, and like we go through now. And his wife, even, the closest thing to him on earth, said, "Won't you curse God and die the death?" [Job 2:9]

L-195 He said, "Thou speakest like a foolish woman. The Lord gave, the Lord taken away, blessed be the Name of the Lord." [Job 2:10]

L-196 And then when the Spirit of God come upon him, and he begin to prophesy, said, "I know my Redeemer liveth, and at the last days He'll stand upon this earth. Though the skin worms destroys this body, yet in my flesh shall I see God." And he made a place to bury himself. He said, "We'll buy this ground." He bought there and buried hisself. [Job 19:25]

L-197 Later on, come a man named Abraham. The church growing, coming on up. Abraham, well, now, he had the 65-0410, The Easter Seal, Ramada Inn, Phoenix, AZ, 137 min potentials of God, too, everlasting Life, Eternal, because God called him. Now notice. When he died, or Sarah died, he bought a piece of ground in Palestine, near Job's grave, and buried Sarah. Abraham died and also was buried with Sarah. Abraham begot--begot Isaac. [Genesis 23:13, 19], [Genesis 25:10]

L-198 And Isaac, when he died, he slept with Abraham, in the same parcel of ground. Now, when, Isaac begot Jacob.

L-199 Jacob died, way down in Egypt. But being a prophet, now, with this potential, this quickening power, he said, "Don't you bury me down here, Joseph. Come here, my prophet son. Put your hand upon this hip that God crippled. Swear to the God of Heaven you'll not bury me down here." What was in that man? Why wasn't Egypt just as good as any place? He was a prophet. He know where that resurrection was going to be. Wasn't going to be in Egypt; would be in Palestine. Said, "Put your hands upon my crippled hip, and you swear by the God that I've served. You're my prophet son, that, you'll not bury my bones down here. Take me up yonder and bury me." [Genesis 47:29-30]

L-200 Joseph, being a prophet, also, laid his hands upon his crippled daddy. Said, "I swear by the God of Abraham, Isaac, of Jacob, I'll not bury you here." They took him and buried him in that land. Why? Why? [Genesis 47:31]

L-201 When Joseph died, he said, "Don't you bury me down here. Don't bury me down here." Why? God is God everywhere, but He has a plan. Joseph was a prophet. He said, "Some day," listen, his words, "the Lord God will re-vis-... will visit you, and will take you out of this land. And when you go, you take my bones." [Genesis 50:25]

L-202 That quickening power was in them bones. Oh! "If the Spirit of Him that raised up Christ from the dead, dwell in you, He'll also quicken your mortal bodies."

L-203 "Don't put my bones down here. Bury them up there with those of the promise."

L-204 When Jesus come, here, I got a Scripture here, Matthew 27:51. When Jesus raised from the dead, Job seen that coming, said, "I know my Redeemer liveth. The last days, He'll stand upon this earth. Though the skin worms has destroyed this body, yet in my flesh I'll see God. I seen Him." They knowed. That was a prophet. Abraham was a prophet. Isaac was a prophet. Jacob was a prophet. Joseph was a prophet. And they had the revelation of God, according to His Word. On that Easter morning, when that One came and redeemed all those who had believed on Him, they raised, too, according to the Bible. [Job 19:25-26], [Matthew 27:51]

L-205 That quickening power come into the grave of Job, where there wasn't even a spoonful of the dust of his bones left. After all those hundreds, and hundreds, and hundreds of years, his bones had decayed. It--it went back, and turned back to the gases of the earth, and just a mere ash dust laid there. But, yet, when that quickening power, according to the Word of God, to the promise, hundreds and hundreds, yes, thousands of years later, when that quickening power was brought forth from the grave; Job, Abraham, Isaac, Jacob, all of them, come out of the grave with Him.

L-206 The Bible said so. Saint Matthew, the 27th chapter and the 51st verse, it said, "Many of the saints that slept in the dust of the earth, resurrected and come out of the graves with Him, when He come up on Easter morning." Why? They had that potential. They had that quickening power, see, and raised up from the dead, and went with Him in the resurrection. Enjoyed the resurrection with Him, because they were full of that quickening power. They had that genuine Easter seal. "Well," you say, "I wish I lived back in the Old Testament." [Matthew 27:52]

L-207 Wait a minute. In First Thessal-... Thessalonians, the 4th chapter, the 16th verse, I want you to read that. "I would not have you ignorant, brethren, concerning those that sleep, that you sorrow not, even as others which have no hope. For if we believe that Jesus died, and rose again the third day," not make-belief, but we believe it, "even so them that sleep in Him shall God bring with Him." [I Thessalonians 4:13-14]

L-208 The New Testament saints with that quickening power, shall resurrect, also, at His second Coming; just as sure as the Old Testament saints with all that quickening power upon their bones, and translations and powers, and so forth, that showed of God. Them prophets who the Word of God came to, they resurrected with Him on that resurrection morning; and with the promise of God that every one that's in Christ Jesus will also come with Him in His resurrection, the quickening power of God upon the bones. [John 6:37], [I Thessalonians 4:15], [John 17:24] 65-0410, The Easter Seal, Ramada Inn, Phoenix, AZ, 137 min

L-209 No wonder, we lay hands on the sick. No wonder, we love one another. We are brothers and sisters. We shouldn't hate one another because we're corrected by the Word of God. We should love another, and have respects for one another. You know, if you don't, it won't help you. [Mark 16:18]

L-210 There's a little fellow setting right here, that, under this church now. A few days ago... That man believes. Little old boy had a cancer on his ear, and he wouldn't say nothing about it. He was working up there at the house. I had been on a hunting trip with him, up there at the Moseley brothers, and Brother Dawson here. We was up here a hunting, Brother William's son. And I happened to look over on his ear. I seen his ear all swelled up. I said, "What's the matter, Donavan, that ear?"

L-211 He said, "Brother Branham, it's been on a long time. I don't know."

L-212 I just--just caught him by the hand there. That was a big cancer on his ear. Never said one word; just held it, and thought, "My brother!" In a day or two after that, there wasn't even a scar left of it. It was his respect in the God of Heaven, by His quickening power, killed that cancer and spared the life of Donavan Weerts back there. That's right.

L-213 What is these things? Look here, people here in Phoenix. Look at you people who has believed in this. Look at the people who has this, that lays their hands upon you. Watch what happens. It's quickening power. "These signs shall follow them that believe." If they lay their hands on the sick, that quickening power, eagle to eagle, something is going to take place. Now, a eagle to a buzzard, won't work. Eagle to eagle, raises from the barnyard, to the Heavenlies. "These signs shall follow them that believe," when they're both in beliefs. [Mark 16:17]

L-214 See that same quickening power of God represented in these two prophets, Elijah and Elisha. Notice, same word; one of them is catch up, the other one is caught up. Catch up and caught up. See? He was caught up. We'll be catch up; catch up with them, meet them in the air. "Be caught up to meet them in the air." [I Thessalonians 4:16-17]

L-215 Notice, a bird has to have two wings, to balance hisself. That right? [Congregation says, "Amen."--Ed.] Elijah was the translating wing, Elijah. Elisha was a resurrection wing. See? Both of them, together, representing the saints that are living and the saints that are gone on.

L-216 Remember, quickened to see the past, the curtains. How these people were quickened back there to look past the curtain and see down in this time; those prophets!

L-217 Look at Paul, said in the last days how these people would be, act and call themselves Christians. He was a prophet, full of the quickening power, foresaw it come to pass. We believe that. Don't we? [Congregation says, "Amen."--Ed.] He received quickening power.

L-218 Look at the quickening power today, foretelling things, without one event missing. Not one time does it fail. Quickening power; not the power of a man; the power of God. The power, the abstract of Easter, the resurrected Jesus that sent back the abstract, to guarantee us that we're already quickened with Him.

L-219 Notice. You remember the little book, the Business Men here, Looking A Past The Curtain Of Time? I begin to get older, knowing my days are getting shorter. I get real...

L-220 I play that little piece that them ladies sang a while ago. I've had it for about eighteen, twenty years now. I Want To Talk It Over, Lord. And get out there and go to praying, then that quickening power comes. I'm rest up. I looked up There. I say, "Looky yonder."

L-221 I remember that morning, being caught a past. And my wife, sitting back there, laying on the same bed with me that morning. I was raised up, and looked up. And there she is, asleep. I said, "If I'm going to do anything for the Lord, you better hurry up, boy. You're past fifty." Then the Holy Spirit caught me away, and I looked over There. I seen those saints, just as certain I'm standing here by this desk, with this sacred Book laying here, and a minister of the Gospel.

L-222 Have I ever told you anything in the Name of the Lord but what happened? Yeah. I want you tell me about it. Every time, has it been perfectly, at the platform? Every time, has it happened just like He said? [Congregation says, "Amen."--Ed.] This was THUS SAITH THE LORD. 65-0410, The Easter Seal, Ramada Inn, Phoenix, AZ, 137 min

L-223 I stood there, looked over that time. I seen tens of thousands times thousands coming, young men and women, run, throwing their arms around me, screaming. I look right back and see myself laying on the bed. "O Lord, let me look a past the curtain of time."

L-224 What is it? It's quickening power that will catch us away. That great quickening power. The quickening power come in this last days.

L-225 That's what I'm in Arizona for, right now. There's many people sitting right here, stood right here at Phoenix, and heard me tell you from this very platform, "THUS SAITH THE LORD." How many remembers it? "Now go. Something is fixing to happen."

L-226 I saw seven Angels come. Didn't Life magazine pack it, as the fog of It floated across here, twenty-seven miles high, and thirty miles across? Is not Fred Sothmann, these other, Gene Norman, them, setting back there? Stood right there when them seven Angels appeared right there on the hill. It shook the hills, for miles around, like that. There stood seven Angels. And throwed a sword in your hand, said, "Go home and open these Seven Seals that are given." And here they are, the true mystery of marriage and divorce, and the serpent's seed, and all of these things that's been fussed about. It's THUS SAITH THE LORD.

L-227 What is it? The quickening power coming to the Church, making Her ready, this hour that we're approaching. Quickening power! O God, help us to receive It. Help us to believe It. [Romans 8:11]

L-228 See, just depends on what attitude you take to It, whether It's going to do you any good, or not, though. See? You have to believe That. You don't believe It, It won't do you one bit of good.

L-229 How old Samuel stood there before that people, and said, "Have I ever told you anything in the Name of the Lord but what happened? Did I ever beg you for your money, to live on?" "No, but we want the king, anyhow."

L-230 That's the way the church is today. They want their own ideas. They won't pay a bit attention to you. They walk right around. Well, it just goes to show, the quickening power is not there.

L-231 "Oh," you say, "I spoke in tongues. I jumped and I shouted." That's all fine.

L-232 But if that quickening power is there, you'll recognize. Like that little eagle; that's his mama. That's the Word. That's THUS SAITH THE LORD. That's what God promised. That's what was foretold. That's exactly what happened. We're beyond any shadow of doubt, potentially in the resurrection right now, the saints getting ready to be taken up in the air.

L-233 So, Jesus, so full of this quickening power, said, "If you can destroy this temple; that took you forty years, you thought, to build; I'll raise it up in three days." [John 2:19]

L-234 Why? Why could Jesus say that? Want to ask you. Why could Jesus say a thing like that? He knew That He was. Amen. I wish I could make that stick. He knew Who He was. He knew that, every Word, God had wrote in there of Him, He had fulfilled it. He knew He was the One David spoke of.

L-235 Do you know you're the ones the Bible speaks of? [Congregation says, "Amen."--Ed.] Do you know your position is in Christ? If you're in Christ, you're a new creature. Do you know this Word is just like everyday living, to you? Why, sure. It's yours. You are an eagle. That's your Food.

L-236 He knew that, by the power of God, He would do it, because it was prophesied He would do it. That's the reason He wasn't scared to say, "Destroy this temple. I'll raise it up in three days, because David said, 'I'll not leave His soul in hell, neither will I suffer My Holy One to see corruption.'" He knowed not one cell of his body would corrupt. And it corrupts in seventy-two hours. He said, "Destroy this temple. I'll raise it up again, and in three days." Why? He was so full of that quickening power that quickened every Word. He looked back and seen every Word God wrote of Him, and prophet said He fulfilled it. He knowed that would be fulfilled, too. [John 2:19], [Acts 2:27, 31], [Psalms 16:10]

L-237 Now, every Word that God said, has your spirit said "amen" to It, It's been fulfilled in your life, as a believer? 65-0410, The Easter Seal, Ramada Inn, Phoenix, AZ, 137 min

L-238 Do you hold back on something, say, "Well, my church teaches different"? Then be careful, hawk.

L-239 Notice. Eagles believe. There no question, to them. They believe It. Notice.

L-240 Now, He knew it would happen because the Word said It was. And every Word wrote of Him had to be fulfilled. He knew that It was written by the power of God, by the holy prophets that had prophesied that He would do so.

L-241 And prophecy never fails. It cannot. The Word of God can't fail. And it is written in the... by the Spirit that... And now, also, the Spirit that raised up Jesus from the dead, if It dwells in your being, your body, It will also quicken your mortal body. Then, shoot it, burn it, do anything you want to, make fun of it, tear it down, turn it down, do what you want to. God will raise it up, for He said He would. And every saint of God has that promise in him, knows that that's the Truth. So, fear not, brother, we already in the Easter. [Romans 8:11]

L-242 Look now at transfiguration, just before we close. Transfigure, transfiguration, we are all represented there in transfiguration. Look what we are seeing today. Notice just what we're seeing today, the quickening power of God. We was all there. There was the dead saints, represented in Moses; there was the resurrection; and Jesus Christ glorified. Elisha... Moses, Elijah, and Jesus, all standing on the mountain; the dead saints, the raptured saints; and Jesus glorified. Oh, my! [Matthew 17:2-3]

L-243 Well, you say... I heard a guy say. They'll say, "You people, why, if you had this kind of power, you ought to go out and tell people what you can do." Far be it from a real Christian, saying a thing like that. See? Surely, we don't claim no power. To...

L-244 But we do one thing. When they looked around, with all this power upon them, "They saw Jesus only." And the real, true believer don't care whether he's backing up a denomination, or nothing about it. He only wants one thing, for you to see that glorified Christ, makes any difference. A real, true Mount Transfiguration experience only glorifies Jesus Christ. It didn't glorify Moses, didn't glorify Elijah, didn't glorify themselves, didn't glorify nothing else, but they seen the glorified Christ. And any true believer, that's what's in his heart, to glorify Jesus Christ. That's what he's trying, get the people to see.

L-245 Not say, "Well, if you come join our groups, if you come do this or do that." Oh, don't do that. Don't do that.

L-246 See God's Word, which is Christ, magnified; and fulfill the promise of this day, in this great hour of resurrection. Notice. And it gives them joy, to know that we are with Him, a flesh of His flesh, and bone of His bones. What a joy! That's the only thing that a real believer cares about.

L-247 They don't care about a denomination. They don't care about an organization. They don't care about what the other women think. They don't care. Certainly not. They won't do these things that the... these other women do. They... These men won't do them things. They won't hang and baby around with some organization, keep from being putting out, and afraid they won't have a meal ticket. They don't care about them things. It's nonsense to them.

L-248 There's only one heart's desire, that is, to see Jesus Christ glorified. Their conduct must be with God. It must absolutely, nothing else, but just the glory of Jesus Christ. And what is Jesus? The Word. That right? [Congregation says, "Amen."--Ed.] Now, notice, and seeing His same vindicated method, proving His resurrection. Now what is it? Seeing your life, by His promised Word that He said, "He's the same yesterday, today, and forever," proving that He's still alive. [John 1:1], [Hebrews 13:8]

L-249 I don't care if every door in the country is closed to me. That, I'm... As I said, I was fifty-six, other day. I could be snapped out. I'm at the heart attack age. I'm in all this other age, and everything else. Well, what difference? It didn't make any difference to me when I was a kid. It don't make any difference now, what hour my number is called, and my card out of the rack. I don't care if they ever knowed I ever lived on the earth. It don't make me no difference. They don't have to have no big monuments and big buildings to say that I was here on earth.

L-250 Only one thing I want them to know, know that "Jesus Christ is the same yesterday, today, and forever." And in my heart I hold His abstract. And I know that some day... Although, I may be drowned in the sea. I may be killed in Africa. Don't know what will happen to me. But one thing I know, I hold the abstract. Hallelujah! Every door can be 65-0410, The Easter Seal, Ramada Inn, Phoenix, AZ, 137 min closed. That don't make a bit of difference to me. I'm not trying to glorify some man or some organization, nor myself, or none of the groups, or nothing else. I want people to see Jesus Christ is raised from the dead, and His Spirit lives. "He's the same yesterday, today, and forever."

L-251 No wonder, Jesus said, "Fear not. I am He that was dead, but I'm alive forevermore." [Revelation 1:18]

L-252 "For now we are redeemed by Him, and are risen with Him, and are now (not will be) setting in Heavenly places in Him." Now, when we have this Spirit in us, the abstract, shows that all of the doubts has been stricken off. What? Christ lives. Not I live; not me. "Christ lives in me." Not you live, but Christ lives in you. Because, His living Word lives in you, showing that all the accounts of all your Methodist, and Baptist, and Pentecostal ideas, everything else, was stricken off. And Jesus Christ... [Ephesians 2:6]

L-253 Like on Mount Transfiguration, all the prophets and everything else is finished. All the days of the Lutheran, the Methodist, the Presbyterian, they're all right, but, "This is My beloved Son. Hear ye Him," the Word of this hour, the hour of the Seals. When, all the mysteries back yonder, that's been hid all these years, them is that great pyramid of time was stricken off, the headstone, make it honed down so that the star of David will settle into Its place. And the great Church of the living God will be raised like the wings of an eagle, packed out yonder into Glory. Yes. [Matthew 17:5], [Mark 9:7], [Luke 9:35]

L-254 In now, in now, in our bodies: with speaking with new tongues; with prophesying, and foreseeing; laying hands on the sick, and they recover; the world, dead, and all the things of the world. We've passed from death unto Life, and we now hold the power. Hallelujah! On that resurrection morning, When death's seals will be broken, We shall rise, (Hallelujah!) we shall rise. (Amen!) [Mark 16:17-18]

L-255 There ain't enough devils in hell to keep us from doing it. We were foreordained of God for this hour. The Word of God manifests Itself right through us. And we live in the Presence of God, by the Word promise of God. Ain't a devil in hell can keep me from raising. Ain't a door he could shut in my face, at that morning. The seals have been broken. Hallelujah! [Colossians 1:26]

L-256 I'm free. I'm an eagle. I'm no longer in a cage, but I'm free. I've raised from the dead, into the new Life of Jesus Christ. Not only me, but every man, women, boy or girl setting here, that's been filled into that Spirit of God, is a new creature in Christ. And you are a eagle. [II Corinthians 5:17]

L-257 We are alive, today, and enjoy the resurrection forevermore. Because He lives, we are alive, also. And He's living us, making us alive. And the Spirit that raised Him from the dead, dwelling in our being, shall quicken our mortal bodies, at that great Eternal Easter. Glory to God! [Romans 8:11]

L-258 Oh, take the world, take anything you want to, but give me Jesus. Amen. I love Him. He's all the world, to me.

L-259 And because that you are a part of Him, I am a part of you, and you are a part of me. And, together, we're a part of Him.

L-260 Oh, Christian, what an opportunity we have! We have opportunities that Saint Paul never dreamed of having. We have opportunities that Enoch, and Elijah, and all them never had, the opportunities we have now.

L-261 And there's one little sheep out yonder somewhere, and He'll not be satisfied till that one comes in the fold. By the help of God, and by a vision, and THUS SAITH THE LORD, I'm returning across the sea. That last little sheep may be a black one down there, for all I know, where they don't even think they got a soul. But God knows different. I'm going to seek till the last day of my life, to find that one, wherever it is.

L-262 I hope I never have offended any of my brethren by saying these strict things. I... Not as I don't want you to go to church. Sure, I want you go to church. You go to church wherever you're going. But just don't let that be your hope, say, "Well, I belong to this, or I belong to that." Oh, brother, sister, belong to Christ. Go to church, but belong to Christ. Amen. 65-0410, The Easter Seal, Ramada Inn, Phoenix, AZ, 137 min

L-263 Let that--let that potential, if that isn't in you, quicken you right now to Life. Won't you just receive It now?

L-264 This room is full of It. I feel It all over me. I know It's here, the power of God, the great Seer of visions, the great Foreteller that can tell the things and it never fails, the great One that can speak and no man can say it's "no," a Man can open and no man can shut. He that was dead is now alive, and alive, today, here in Phoenix, walking amongst the new-born flowers.

L-265 No wonder, on that Easter morning little tear drops of dew was laying on every lily's cheek and every rose. Why? It knowed it was brought up through the ground, and somewhere there's an Eternal flower blooming. It'll take its place some day. That's right.

L-266 No wonder, joyful tears can run down our cheeks. No wonder, our hearts quiver and shake when we can feel that same transforming power coming into our lives and filling us, even for letting us speak in a language that comes from Heaven. [Mark 16:17], [Acts 2:4]

L-267 We're so quickened up into His Presence there, prophesy, foresee, foretell, and everything hitting perfectly with the Word. If it's prophesying contrary to That, don't believe it. But if it's with the Word, It's already said, THUS SAITH THE LORD.

L-268 "Fear not. I am He that was dead, and alive forevermore." That is God's Easter seal that seals every letter of this Word into your heart. What is the seal? "You are written epistles, read of all men." You know that. But when God has claimed you, He sealed you with the Easter seal, that you are risen with Christ, and you are a new creature. [Revelation 1:18]

L-269 If you haven't been sealed this morning, do so while we bow our heads.

L-270 [A brother begins speaking in another tongue. Blank.spot.on.tape--Ed.]... Lord. You hear that? [Congregation says, "Amen."]

L-271 Think now, with your heads bowed. Romans 8:11, "If so be that the Spirit that raised up Christ from the dead be in you, It will also quicken your mortal bodies." [Romans 8:11]

L-272 What can we look forward to, people? What is there left? Look at Formosa and all the world. And atomic missiles and everything else just ready to strike the world, and just so nervous, and scared, and screaming. And these movie mimics is on, out there, just telling all kind of jokes, just like a little boy going through the graveyard, whistling at night, trying to make the people believe that everything is all right. Don't you be deceived. The Coming of the Lord is at hand. [James 5:8], [II Peter 3:12]

L-273 You notice, the other day, a fisherman come up and told me, sitting down yonder in the bay, that, some kind of a rugged point or something another down here. And how, that, long before that earthquake shook over in Greece, all the fish that usually feeds about that time of morning, they didn't feed. What was it? They wasn't on the surface. The second time it happened, same thing took place. He knew right then something is going to happen. Them fish wasn't feeding at that time.

L-274 And all the gulls and things that feed on the fish, they quit feeding. That early in the morning, that's when they feed. They just sit up on the bank, got away from the cliffs and things. For, just in a few minutes, the sea moss begin to boil up out of the earth, off the sea bed. See? Them fish knew it before it happened.

L-275 Going into India, I read the paper, said, "The earthquake must be over." For days, the little birds wouldn't come back to their nests in the rocks. The cattle wouldn't stand around the shelters under the... in the shade, in the heat of the day. The sheep stood right out in the middle field, leaned against one another. They wouldn't go up around them rocks, two or three days before the earthquake happened.

L-276 Why? Them sheep knew it. They knew something was going to happen. Those birds knew something was going to happen. Those gulls knew something was going to happen. Those fish knew something was going to happen. It's the same God that led those animals into the ark.

L-277 Can't you see, spirit-filled people, something is fixing to happen? Don't look for some great big universal 65-0410, The Easter Seal, Ramada Inn, Phoenix, AZ, 137 min something, sweeping, nothing but the Coming of the Lord Jesus. Remember, just remember the Words and promise of the Lord.

L-278 Won't you come on in right quick? Get away from them big walls. The resurrection is near at hand now. If there's someone here that don't know that they would go in that resurrection, and not sure that they've got that resurrection power resting in them!

L-279 Though the skin worms destroy it, though an atomic bomb burst right in the middle of you, it'll never destroy that quickening, resurrection power. No, no. Sister, brother, your precious name is put on the Lamb's Book of Life up yonder. No man can rub it out. There isn't enough rubbing compounds, in the world, to rub your name from the Book There where His Blood has bought it. [Job 19:26], [Revelation 21:27]

L-280 If you're not sure of that, don't--don't take a chance on it now. See? You might take a chance on running through a barricade somewhere and not get killed, but you're not going to run through this barricade. No, no. You're going to get it. You won't have to. There's a red light flashing now. Bypass, bypass your own ideas, bypass the things of the world.

L-281 Come. Let's be resurrected together in this grand Easter time, the great celebration of the Easter. Can you celebrate it in your heart this week? If you can't, would you just raise your hand to God?

L-282 Say, "God, I'm not sure of it. I don't know whether I could just do all that or not. Will You help me? I'm going to raise my hand to You, Lord. Help me." God bless you. God bless you. That's good. "I--I--I want You, Lord. Help me. I--I want--I want to be raised. I--I want to be. I want to have the potentials right now. I want to know it's right. I want to know that it's right, Lord. I know, can't make no mist-... Don't want no mistake then. It ain't going..." It's going to be too late. Now is the day. My! Now is the day. Don't wait.

L-283 Not long ago, I was preaching. There was an old colored man come back there at the back the building, met me. Said, says, "Reverend, I wants to tell you. I says you is right." He said, "I done told the Lord, a long time ago, I want my ticket in my hand that morning. I want to know that it's marked right." Said, "It's going to be a lot of trouble down there at the river." He said, "I--I--I'm coming down that river." He said, "I--I don't want no trouble there. I want to get it all straightened up right here." That's right.

L-284 Got your visa? If you haven't got your visa... You may have a passport, but, if you haven't got your visa, you can't enter the Land. You know that. Have you got your everything ready? If it isn't, right now is the time to do it.

L-285 Fear not, if you're a little bit scared. Now, there's about maybe a hundred hands went up in here. So if you're just a little bit scared, now let's just settle it.

L-286 Now, I know we have different ways. Some men say, "Come up, let me shake your hand." Other say, "Come up, kneel at the altar." Now, them is fine. I haven't got one word to say against it, at all, not a thing, anything that will save.

L-287 But let me just tell you my way. "As many as believed, as many..." Coming to the altar won't make you believe. Shaking hands with the minister won't make you believe. But if you're called of God, and you're an eagle, to begin with, just a scream tells you. You'll believe. If you really believe it, I'm going to pray with you. [Acts 13:48], [John 11:26], [John 5:24]

L-288 Could you imagine that little eagle stay in that barnyard any longer? No, no. Huh-uh. No. Don't stay here any longer, friend. Let's--let's Rapture now. The grace of God is here to do it.

L-289 Heavenly Father, we realize that we're coming down towards the closing hour. We haven't too long to be here now. Not as our age, but at the time. We believe there's a many young person setting here, will be living when this happens. It may happen yet today. We don't know the minute or hour. But, Lord, You told us, "When you see these things taking place," and they been taking place now for a long time. [Luke 21:28, 31]

L-290 We know we're way over, according to the scientists. Six, seven years ago, we was three minutes to midnight. We don't know how much time that is, ticking on, but we know we're right there.

L-291 O God, to have that assurance: to see that our heart punctuates every promise of God with "amen," to see that the Spirit Itself, that's come into us, quickens our being. 65-0410, The Easter Seal, Ramada Inn, Phoenix, AZ, 137 min

L-292 God, let my brethren see that, this morning. Let my brethren see that, that that Spirit comes in and quickens to the Word. Let my sisters see the same thing, Lord. And then, if they see something that won't let them quicken to that Word, O God, may they get rid of it right quick. Grant it, Father. It's all in Your hands now. I know I've failed in many things, and continue to fail, but, Lord, I've done all I know how to do. Now it's in Your hands. They're Yours. In Jesus' Name, receive them, Father. [Psalms 119:50], [John 6:63]

L-293 Now to you that's here and that's needy of healing for your body. How many believers are here? Raise your hand. "I am a believer, as far as I know my heart." How many possess? You know, beyond a shadow of doubt, that in your heart, right now, you've been raised from the dead? You know? Oh, my! What could happen in a meeting like this then? I know I'm late, but what could happen right now? Just think of what could take place. The potentials is laying right in you. See? You, with your hand up, you've took like--like an oath, to God, that, "I know that something has happened to me. I may not be right where I ought to be."

L-294 Neither am I. No, sir. I'm a long ways from where I should be. But I know this one thing, I've passed from death to Life. I know something happened to me. Many... Not as an old man now, but many, many years ago, it happened. [I John 3:14], [John 5:24]

L-295 And I know, that day when I walked into that hospital, when I had my great challenge. I seen my wife die; me calling for her life. "And what have I done but stand on the street corner, preach, and pray for the sick?" And then Satan said, "Well, He won't answer your prayer."

L-296 I seen her die, but I know that in her was that resurrection power. Them bones shall rise again.

L-297 I seen my little baby lay there. And I lay my hand on, say, "God, don't take it."

L-298 Look like He pulled the curtain down, said, "I won't even hear you no more."

L-299 Satan said, "There it is. Just one word..." He knowed better than tell me there was no God, 'cause I knowed that. But he said He don't love me, He don't care for me. See? Every reason thing, said, "You're just a young man, yet twenty years old. There lays your wife laying down here in a morgue. And here is your baby going there. And--and just... You said He was a great healer, and He's all this. And, look, what does He do? One word, He wouldn't even have to speak it, just look down there and say. Just nod His head, that's all would take place, and it'd be healed. But, you see, He don't love you. He don't care for you. Letting your baby die right there now, and even refuse to hear your prayer in this dark hour."

L-300 Everything he said was absolutely the truth. "So what have you done? Work all day long, till you couldn't hardly stand up. And then sit up all night, till twelve and one o'clock. Standing on the street corners, preaching. Making calls to hospital. Just come in and sit down, a chair, sit there and sleep an hour or two, and go back to work again. Next night, the same thing. And here you are, about twenty-one, twenty-two years old. Every friend, every young lady, every young man that you ever associated with, called you a crazy crank. What have you done? You made a fool out of yourself. Don't you see it?" I was just about ready to agree with him.

L-301 And Something down in me, that was that quickening power. I said "The Lord gave, and the Lord taken away. Blessed be the Name of the Lord." When all my hopes give way, Then He's all my hope and stay. For on Christ, the... [Blank.spot.on.tape--Ed]... sinking sand. Oh, He shall come with triumph sound, Then may I then be in--in Him be found, Wrapped in the robes of His righteousness. [Job 1:21]

L-302 Not in my own; I don't have any. Mine is filthy, dirty rags. I'd hate to try to go to Heaven on my preaching. Hate to try to go to Heaven on my visions. I'm going to Heaven because I hold His grace in my heart. His grace, that's why I'm going. That's how we go. 65-0410, The Easter Seal, Ramada Inn, Phoenix, AZ, 137 min

L-303 Oh, friend, you're a part of this Body. You are God's little children. Now, I'm saying this to build your hope. If you found...

L-304 If I found favor with you, told you the Truth. And what I've told you, is--is the prophet said, of years gone by. Not making myself His prophet. No, sir. But I'm telling you the Truth. Has He ever said anything but what was right? I've knowed you now for some twenty-something years, here in Phoenix, since that song, I'd Like To Talk It Over With Him, over at Brother Outlaw's church, I believe it was, and Brother Garcia. Have I ever told you anything in the Name of the Lord but what happened?

L-305 Remember, there's only one hope. Get this quickening power. It'll hold you. When everything else has give away, It'll hold you.

L-306 Some of them said, "Did you keep your religion, Brother Branham?" I said, "No. It kept me."

L-307 It keeps me. No, I don't keep it. It ain't whether I hold on, or not. It's whether He held on, or not. He is what held on for me.

L-308 He didn't have to. Angels was set in every tree, said, "Just pull your fingers loose. Just point; you don't have to take it from the cross. Just point your finger, and watch what." See, that mocking bunch. But if He had did that, I couldn't have had this testimony today; you couldn't had it. But because He stayed to the cross, He held there, that's why I hold with Him. On Christ, the solid Rock, I stand; All other grounds are sinking sands.

L-309 Now, if you're sick, will you lay your hands on one and another. Let's pray. Just lay your hands on somebody by you. Regardless of what's wrong with you, have faith now. If I ever told you the Truth, I tell you now. See? Jesus said, "These signs shall follow them that believe." And you're believers, you just raise your hands. Don't doubt. There's some poor suffering person that you got your hands on. Somebody has got their hands on you. [Mark 16:17]

L-310 Remember that quickening power, that power that raised up Jesus from the grave. Now you have faith in what you got in your--in your own body. It's going to help that person that you got your hands on. "If It indwells you, It'll also quicken your mortal bodies."

L-311 Dear God, as I stand here this morning, nearing the noonday time, when it's about this hour the day when Jesus cried, "My God, My God, why hast Thou forsaken Me? I thirst." No wonder, the prophet foresaw it, and said, "All My bones, they stare at Me. They pierced My hands and My feet." "But He was numbered with the transgressors. But He was wounded for our transgressions. He was bruised for our iniquity. The chastisement of our peace was upon Him, and with His stripes we are healed." We claim that, this morning, God. We claim that. [Matthew 27:46], [Mark 15:34]

L-312 In the morning of this resurrection, notice, this vindicated Truth that I've told, Lord, from Your Word, in the Presence of God. He is Judge, and we are witnesses that He's redeemed us. And in us lays, by the grace of God, that resurrecting power. And our friends are sick, the one that the hands is laid upon.

L-313 O God, we challenge the Devil, in the midst of our faith this morning, with hands laid upon the people, and me with my hands stretched over the people. Let every disease, every affliction that tries to hold the people, in the presence of this vindicated Truth, come out. In the Name of Jesus Christ, may these people be made free today. That, the Bible, the Words of our God said, "If they lay their hands on the sick, they shall recover." And our hands has been up in the air, towards You, God. [Mark 16:18]

L-314 As, every plant of the earth drinks at Your fountain. And as sure as that plant, that's germitized, drinks from Your fountain, it begins to build up. It begins to grow. The stalk of corn, the flower, whatever it is that's drinking in Your fountain, grows up towards You.

L-315 And this morning, we've growed, inches, Lord. We can reach up higher. We're drinking at Your fountain. We are Your creatures, with the resurrection power within us, Lord. And we pray that You'll hear our prayer for our brothers 65-0410, The Easter Seal, Ramada Inn, Phoenix, AZ, 137 min and sisters. And may every affliction, that's hindering these dear people here that possesses this power, Lord, turn them loose, so they can serve God. And it shall be well, Lord. In the Name of Jesus Christ. Amen.

L-316 You believe Him? [Congregation says, "Amen."--Ed.] Leave a thing like this? How can you do it? You just have to, look like, just pull yourself away. Do you feel that way? ["Amen."] I--I--I... It may just be me, that I'm... But I had a feeling, just a strange feeling when I come among the people, where you set together like this. I know, somewhere, invisible here; just like radio, television, whatever it is, passing through this room; Christ is in this room. Just think, our Redeemer! Tony, He's here. Amen.

L-317 And who could be any happier than people who possess, with Bible evidence of every Word of God being made manifest, to see even to Angels and His Being, as they have through the--the ages! And hear the Words of the seers, predicted and it happened just exactly. And here we are at the eve of His Coming. Oh, what a wonderful time!

L-318 We'll see Him. One of these days, He'll be here. Until He does come, will you pray for me? [Congregation says, "Amen."--Ed.] I've got dangerous perils in front of me. I know it. See? And I meet with heathens who would shoot you, same as taking a drink of water, and you're just paid for. You come on their ground, devils that'll challenge you on the Bible, just as easy. But I never seen a time but what our God won the victory. I go in His Name, in the Name of the Lord Jesus Christ, the hope of Eternal Life, the resurrection and the Life. "He that liveth and believeth in Me, though he were dead yet shall he live. And whosoever liveth and believeth in Me shall never die." I believe that to be God's Eternal Word. Do you believe the same? ["Amen."] Will you pray for me? ["Amen."] I'll pray for you. May God watch over us until we meet again. [John 11:25-26]

L-319 Now let us stand up to our feet, just a moment. (Got anything you want to say?) Let us bow our heads.

L-320 It just wouldn't be right for us not to sing this little song, would it? Remember our song, I Love Him, is that in every heart? Let's just sing it. Sister, dear, would you... I want to say, I appreciate your playing, too, sister. All right. I love Him, I love Him Because He first loved me And purchased my salvation On Calvary's tree. Now we're going to change the song. My faith looks up to Thee, Thou Lamb of Calvary, Saviour divine; Now hear me while I pray, Oh, take all my guilt away, Oh, let me from this day Be wholly Thine!

L-321 Doesn't that do something to you? How many likes that real heart... I--I--I like jubilee songs. Sure, I do. But when you're in a spirit of worship, don't you love those old sweet hymns? I believe the Holy Spirit moved upon Eddie Perronet and them that wrote those grand old songs. Don't you believe that? Fanny Crosby, when she wrote. Pass me not, my, O gentle Saviour, Hear my humble cry; While on others Thou art calling, Do not pass me by. Thou the Stream of all my comfort, More than life to me, Whom have I on earth beside Thee? Or whom in Heaven but Thee?

L-322 Isn't that wonderful? That makes us want to sing I Love Him. Doesn't it? [Congregation says, "Amen."--Ed.] Now, 65-0410, The Easter Seal, Ramada Inn, Phoenix, AZ, 137 min while we sing this time, I Love Him, let's... We love one another. If we don't love one another, then we can't love Him. Now let's just shake one another's hand. Just stand, and just reach across the table somewhere, shake hands, one another. I... [Brother Branham turns from the microphone and speaks with someone--Ed.] And purchased my salvation On Calvary's tree. Let us bow our head now.

L-323 Going to ask Brother Williams, young Brother Williams, to come here just a moment. I'm going to ask him if he'll dismiss this audience in prayer.

L-324 I love Brother Williams, a young Christian, that I think is truly a servant of Christ, his little family. I have a lot of fellowship with these. And those precious Moseley boys and all of them, we been together, and so many of my dear friends here in Phoenix, that I love with all my heart. I think, that morning in that vision, He said, "All that you ever loved, and all that loves you, God has given you."

L-325 Believe someone here repenting of their sin, down on the floor, a young lady crying. Let's just bow our heads a moment for her.

L-326 Dear God, is that that little sheep that was left in Phoenix? I don't know, God. You know. But, some day, it will be. But, Father, this, no doubt, is one. So I pray that You'd help her, just now. Sweetly open up the gate, say, "Come, child of Mine. Come in from the tired, weary road. You been stumbling out there in the dark. I come out, today, to get you. It's My Spirit that's speaking to you and bringing you into the fold now." Grant it, God. May this young woman... just at the crossroads of life here. "He that will hear My Words, and believe on Him that sent Me, has everlasting Life." Grant it, dear God, to this young Christian. "He that will come to Me, I will in nowise cast out." While saints are standing over the young woman, praying. [John 5:24], [John 6:37]

L-327 Remember, even Paul, who was stoned so bad that he was dying, and when the...?... saints stood over and prayed, life come back. Because, in them bodies of those saints was that quickening power that brought the spirit of life back to Saint Paul. God, it could certainly pray the prayer, of death out of... or the death out of the person, by the prayer of faith, to life. Grant it, dear God.

L-328 Bless us now as we wait upon Thee. In Jesus Christ's Name, we pray.

L-329 Now with your heads bowed, I'm going to ask Brother Williams. Courtesy of Living Word Broadcast P. O. Box 4951 Naperville, IL 60567 USA Email: thevoice1017@lwbcast.org http://www.lwbcast.org/ Does God Ever Change His Mind About His Word?
