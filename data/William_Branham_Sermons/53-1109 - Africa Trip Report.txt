--- TRANSCRIPT ---

L-1 Thank you Brother Bosworth. Good evening friends. Very happy to be here this evening to minister in the Name of our Lord Jesus to the sick and afflicted, needy people. And I trust, by God's grace that tonight that He will give to us the greatest night we've had in all the services, because of His presence being with us. And now before we go much farther, I... sometimes I forget these handkerchiefs. I used to mention it in the meetings, but I... about sending to my home for handkerchiefs, and I always send out hundreds of them a week. But it's a... reason I don't say that, I happened to think that so many people on the radio are trying to say, "Just write us a letter." They're only trying to get your address, so they could make you kind of a mailing list, but I--I don't want to do that. I just... anything I could help you to, I'd be glad to do it, but... And if you don't have your handkerchief here; I'll pray for it right here if you got it, and if you don't have it, why you just send in. It don't cost you nothing, we'd be glad to send it, help you to everything we can. Send literature with it, to instruct you on how to do. You know at the same time that your... these handkerchiefs goes on you... all the way around the world, there's prayer being made at the same time. Ev... At three o'clock... nine o'clock at morning, twelve o'clock at noon, and three o'clock in the afternoon Eastern Standard, I mean Central Standard Time, completely around the world, there's a circle, at that same time from my own meetings; results of them, hook up around the world. And some of them get up at twelve o'clock at night, two o'clock in the morning to offer prayer. Now I have more testimonies over the handkerchiefs, than I have testimonies out among meetings. That's right. Cause, it reaches more. Send out hundreds and hundreds of them a week. So now, let's just bow our heads a moment, and ask God to bless these people. Our Heavenly Father, it's with great delight that we bring these people before Thee. Laying here tonight is these handkerchiefs that represent sick and afflicted people. We love them, because they love You. And Thou has brought us nigh unto Thee by the washing of Thy blood of the water of the Word, and has brought these people to relationship with us. And now we are sons and daughters of God, brothers and sisters in Christ. And our hearts go out for each other in sickness and in trouble, when one member suffers all the members suffer from the effects. Father, in my heart and in our hearts tonight, we suffer with the burden that You'll heal all these people. We want to see them well. We want to see them up, going about, and well and healthy. And then in the Bible, we read that where they taken from the body of Saint Paul, handkerchiefs and aprons, and the sickness was healed and unclean spirits went out. And now I have the Bible laying on these handkerchiefs, and Father, we pray that You'll bless each one of them, and may they be healed, each and every one. For we ask it in Jesus Name, Thy Son, Amen. May the Lord bless each one of these handkerchiefs for its intended purpose. Now in the Word just for a few moments, I would like to read, and I promise you tonight that I would tell you about the vision that's going to take place pretty soon. And I--I trust that God will--will give to each one of you the... His blessing, while we're reading the Word and trying to explain it. And some of you want to put down the vision, of course, of what's going to take place, you're more than welcome. Anything that's ever been said concerning when it's THUS SAITH THE LORD tacked onto it, why you'll find out, I'll lay my life right to it. It'll be just that way. And here not long ago, two years before it come to pass, told of a little boy being raised in Finland, you read the story of it in the book. And by the way, now we're... as I say, we're not book selling, because we don't... we just let you have the book. But if you want one for a Chirstmas present, or some of your friends, tonight's your last chance because we don't sell on the Sabbath. And any of the pictures, take one of them home with you, we'd be glad for you to have it; just at the cost, just at What it cost us to get it, get it here to you, you're welcome to it. Ane we don't commercialize on anything at all, not a thing. And--and our meetings, if God don't supply our needs, then it's time for me to get--get off the field and go home, see. But when He supplies my needs, why I just keep on staying where ever He leads me to go. And if He has no place to led me, why then I just go where ever the managers picks out a place to go. And I love people, and I love to minister to them, and I love them because they love Christ. And if they love Christ, then they bound to love me. You can't 53-1109, Africa Trip Report, National Guard Armory, Owensboro, KY, 59 min love--you can't love Christ and hate me. You--you got to love me too, because I'm--I'm His servant. And I have to love you, because you're His servant; and I happily and most gracefully, in my heart, do love you, everyone. That's true. Now I want to read something from His Word, which found in Acts the 17th chapter. And this was included into the vision, so it was of a great man, Paul. It's the 21st verse of the 27th chapter of Acts. After a long abstinence Paul stood forth in the midst of them, and said, Sirs, you should have hearkened unto me, and not have loosed from Crete, and to have caused this harm and loss. But now I exhort you to be of good cheer: for there stood by me... (Beg your pardon? The 22nd verse) And... I exhort you to be of a good cheer: for there shall be no loss of any man's life among you, but of the ship. For there stood by me this night an angel of God, whose I am, and whose servant I am. Saying, Fear not, Paul; thou must be brought before Caesar: and, lo, God has given unto thee all them that sail with thee. Wherefore, sirs, be of good cheer: for I believe God, that it shall be even as it was told me. May the Lord add His blessing to His Word.

L-2 Now, could you imagine on a stormy sea, and all hopes, and knowing they were out of the will of God, 'cause God had warned Paul not to loosed from Crete, but he couldn't help it. But they went ahead. The ship master, he knowed more about it then what the Holy Spirit did, you know. So he just loosed and went ahead anyhow. And they got out on the ship there in the sea, and there come up a great storm, and for several days and nights there was no moon, no stars, fourteen days and nights. And all hopes that they'd ever be saved was all give up and gone. They was bound to be drowned. They throwed out the tackle of the ship and everything, and still just let it drive, and it was just going anyway. And Paul went down into the gallery and prayed. And there was an Angel that stood by Paul, and said--told him the message.

L-3 Now, I can just see that little Jew come up on top of the--the ship where all these men were weeping and crying. They'll never see their wives again, never see their children again. Just like the doctor tells you that, "You just get ready to die. The cancer's going to kill you. And you'll never get up from the bed no more, and your days are finished." And--and they're weeping. They'll never be up again or something like that. But this little Jew went down in there and prayed through until he touched God. And in a vision, standing by his side, he saw an Angel which brought him the message, the Angel of the Lord. And he come up and he said, "Wherefore, sir, be of a good cheer: for the Angel of God, Whose servant I am, stood by me last night and said, 'Fear not, Paul; for thou must be brought before Caesar: and, lo, God has give all them that sail with you to you. There won't be any loss of any man.' So he said, wherefore, sirs, be of a good cheer: for I believe God, that it shall be just as it was shown me." Now, I'm so thankful. Wouldn't you like to have been there when Paul, when that was taking place on that ship? Wouldn't we had a wonderful time, just to rejoice and shout with Paul, and walk up and down that--the galleries of that ship? Why, I couldn't have kept still. Could you? And I just wonder why we keep still, and the same thing taking place here night after night. See? That's what I wonder. The same thing... If we'd have been there, we'd have just like we are now. The great things of God is so great, and yet people try to imagine so much out in here somewhere in the supernatural of a hocus-pocus like, when it's right down here.

L-4 I can teach a five year old child the Kingdom of God, better that I can teach a man that's got a--a degree out of college. I can teach him Christ better. He's simple. He just listens to what you say. Watch coming to the platform. You'll never see God turn a child down. He don't do it. No, sir. Because they're just simple in faith. They believe it. And when they believe it, that just settles it. God says so, and that--that takes care of it. The little child will believe it, but, oh, my, we know better, you know. We knowed all the angles, and just how could it be. We got to figure out, "Now, how could this be?" But it'll be anyhow. What caused me to go to--to Africa on this trip? Just to... Brings up this vision. And I'm watching that clock there, but I'm way early, so I got plenty of time. It's only twenty-five minutes till four, so I--I suppose I have a whole lot of time. But you... Some of you brothers let me know about, when it's just about time to start the prayer line in about a half-hour. 53-1109, Africa Trip Report, National Guard Armory, Owensboro, KY, 59 min

L-5 I was with Brother Bosworth. It was the night the Angel of the Lord's picture was taken. How many has got that picture now in your possession? Thank you. I'm sure it'll be a great blessing to you. Here sometime ago, there's a lady at the hospital at the city I live. The picture was setting on the table. The doctor had told here she couldn't get well. Now, this is her story. She said looking at... Not at her brother, but to the Angel of the Lord... Now, if you'll notice, friends, that is a--a Pillar of Fire. George J. Lacy, you read what he said. Now, that's the best that we got in the United States on--on that kind of work, on research. And when he said that day, said, "If--if the old hypocrite (he meant the unbeliever) says that there can be... never could be scientifically proved that there was a supernatural Being," but said, "he can't say that now, because here's scientific proof that there is a supernatural Being." For you hear what he said. The Light struck the lens. See? And It was there. It was... He said, "The mechanical eye of this camera won't take psychology." Said, "It's not psychology." Said, "I've said it was psychology, Mister Branham, myself," but said, "mechanical eye of this camera won't take psychology. The Light struck the lens. And the--the Being was there."

L-6 You heard what Mr. Dr. Stomewell... How many reads "The Voice of Healing," and read that article in there of Dr. Stomewell on that? He said, "Absolutely." Now, he don't know nothing about this picture yet. He was an atheist, just been converted a few weeks. But he said that, "That magnetic power of a believer in contact with God was so vital," he said, "that even he believed over the Christ, that that halo that was painted was absolutely could been seen." Because it's a power. Now, just think. He took a--a machine. You know, the human being is not made to lie. And if you're telling a lie, they can put you before a lie detector, and your nerves will react. And then they took this same thing and converted it to a way that they could tell whether it was truth or not, and put it on a person praying, and I think it taken, I forget how many thousand kilowatts to send a radio message around the world, and when this woman begin to pray at her death, there went out enough power from her till it registered over as far as the needle would go. Enough power leaving that woman, actually supernatural power that caught on this machine, some kind of a magnetic power of her prayer, that was powerful enough to send a radio message fifty-five times around the world. That's scientific.

L-7 Men working around in science has found God. That's right. He lives out there. He is in the scientific world. They just touched around on His little basic play things, that He plays with, or has out there for them. Now, they're coming up into a place, in a category, where they can find Him. Now, on this picture, Brother Bosworth brought me the picture of Florence Nightingale, and you... I'm sorry. We have no more of those books. They're out of print at the time. We wasn't financially able to... Was about ten thousand dollars, to cost about a dollar apiece to print them to put them back in print, and they won't print less than ten thousand. So we couldn't do it. But when they first went out, why then, we sold all them, and they were gone.

L-8 Then, in there he got a copyright from permitting the copyright to place this picture in there. The picture belongs to the Douglas Studios, not me. And--and then, in this picture, as I was saying a few moments ago, a woman in the hospital was looking at it, and was praying after her doctor told her she couldn't get well. She claimed that she seen that picture, that mill of Fire, come out of there and stand over where she was. I knowed one thing, I don't know what taken place there, but the next day, she was sent home well. I don't know what. I--I know that. And she was sent home well. Now, It's His Being. And if we'll read the Scripture, we find out that it was a Pillar of Fire that led the children of Israel. That same Pillar of Fire, I believe, was over Jesus Christ. And I believe that He's raised--risen from the dead, showing the same signs that He showed when He was here on earth. And it's that same Pillar of Fire that's over the Church right now, the same Angel of God, that same Presence.

L-9 Now, there is times that you say, "God..." We have--want to look at it that way, but there's many times that things are done and said that angelic Beings brings the message to Him. God was in a certain place, and met a certain man at a certain time, and if He could've found a man one time, in the end He would've slew him, and so forth. We realize that there's times where God is certain places. That's exactly truth. The Scripture teaches that. Now, in this case when we promise God... And I told you a few nights ago about the healing of Florence Nightingale. 53-1109, Africa Trip Report, National Guard Armory, Owensboro, KY, 59 min When we went down into Africa... Now, my wife is setting somewhere in the building. I haven't spied where she's at yet, but anyhow, I guess she's got backed up in a corner. So anyhow, she's as bashful as I used to be. And so, anyhow, when--when we were... Knowed so much about the... I tell you how much geography we knowed. I told her. She said, "Where you going now, honey."

L-10 I said, "I'm going down to Durban, South Africa, or--or Durban, Southern Rhodesia. That's where I going." Why... And she wrote... I said, "You write all of my mail to Durban, Southern Rhodesia." And here, she was writing to Durban, Southern Rhodesia, and Durban's in South Africa, not in Rhodesia. Just be like writing Owensboro, British Columbia. There is no such a place. See? But anyhow, the man, I guess, seeing how dumb we were, so they just... The post office sent it on down to South Africa, another nation, and down in Durban. But when we landed in Johannesburg that afternoon, I guess there was many, many thousand people at the ramp. And so then, when we went out that night and got into Durban... Now, Brother Bosworth setting here, which was right present for every bit of it... And there was Mr. Baxter, and many of the others; my boy also was present. And when we landed, why then, they had to take me several miles out into the country where they had no place to put the people, and no park, no nothing in the city. Had to go way out into the country to where there's a big school, and place them out there. And I guess the police was guarding the roads up and down, just strings of people for miles. And there they was, all out in this place. It taking us, oh, I guess, twenty-five, thirty minutes to drive to where the place was.

L-11 And when we got there, I'd been in the air for three days and three nights, almost wrecked twice. You heard in the paper here about three years ago, when a car... Fifty-two were killed at one time. We were just behind that accident. And the same place, the instrument broke, and we were over that city, my boy and I, over that city for about two and a half hours, trying to come down with no instrument, and it so fog you couldn't even see nothing. It... Go right down real low and see the lights, then they was going... My wife would've been screaming and crying and praying if she'd knowed that I was in that fix then. But I was... Not only was she praying, that she'd been praying, I was praying. That's right. And I was very thankful that I had a heavenly Father Who was riding by my side to help me down.

L-12 Sailors and things, when they got off of there, said, "Well, this is the last one. For the rest of the way from here, we'll go by ship. They can have all the airplanes they want. We'll take ours by water." And so, they were ready to get away. And so, finally when we got in there, and got out to the place where the meeting was, I just got at the platform, tired, no sleep, you can imagine what it was, rocking and pitching in that air for all that time, and thousands of people, just like oceans of people were setting. And they were... I was strange. I thought Africans were all black people, but every one of these was white. And I said, "Are these Africans?" "Yeah, they're all Afrikaans people."

L-13 So I expect when I landed in--down there that I'd have to find a beaten path to the little hut, but I come to find out it's more modern then our cities are here in America. It's just a beautiful place at Johannesburg. So I thought, "My, this is strange." I thought, "Where's all the David Livingstons? They won't need them around here no more." And so, they... We went out to the people there, and just as soon as we got to the platform, I happened to notice coming across the top of the people, I guess, Brother Bosworth, I hadn't been there, oh, about five minutes, till a vision started, and I seen a--a bus moving like this over top the audience, and it was something blue, and I just kept watching it, till it got to me. I wasn't saying nothing, because I was tired, and didn't know just exactly where to make my first beginning, the closing to a vision, to close in with the individual to a vision. And I noticed the--the bus coming. It come right close to me real close, and I seen a sign on it said, "Durban." And the bus went out of my sight. Well, I just started on speaking, and went on, and I noticed, here come that bus again. And I seen it stop, and I seen a boy get on that had one leg about six inches shorter than the other one on a crutch. And he held his leg on this crutch (You see?), and walked like that. He got on the bus, and I seen him coming on like that. That bus come on up close to me and stopped again. Well, I just kept on speaking, if I said, "I'm awfully tired tonight. I'm really worn out." I said, "We're expecting a great meeting here in Africa. We just closed one in New York City, and..." 53-1109, Africa Trip Report, National Guard Armory, Owensboro, KY, 59 min Now, there's something about New York City. Now, you watch. Remember, there's something about New York City. Don't forget that, you hear? All right. I had just left New York, New York. I said, "I'm so tired." And I watched that. Then I seen this boy again coming, walking across the audience, and he didn't have this crutch under his arm any more. He was just normal and well, with his leg just a normal size.

L-14 Now, this was the first thing, they'd been setting there about... Been... I'd been in the audience of people at least ten minutes. And I happened to look, and where the boy had walked and stopped in the air, I looked right down below him, and there sit the boy, just about the distance of this building, hardly as far. And I looked and seen the boy. And I said, "Don't you come from Durban there, son, with the white shirt on?" He said, "Yes, sir." Spoke English. "Yes, sir." He come from Durban. I said, "Aren't one of your legs about six inches shorter?" And he said, "That's me, exactly." I said, "It isn't any more. You're healed." And here he come walking up there just as normal just as he could be. And the people begin screaming, and faith, oh, my, with one collapse.

L-15 Just then I seen a little green car hit the road like this, and turn around like this, and slide backward, hit a tree. I seen them take a young lady, blond-headed, and she was all broke up. They wouldn't let... move her. They went and got the doctors, and they put her on a ambulance. It was in her spine. She was broke three or four places in the spine. But I seen the thing take place, but I couldn't tell where it was. I couldn't see that girl, that went when... And it happened, there was a high fence like, a high place built, and I happened to look right down under me, and here she laid right down here, beneath right here. I seen it was the same girl. And I said, "Didn't you have an accident recently?" "Yes." And I said, "You was in a little green car, and the--the car slid sideways and then backed up like this and hit a tree." She said, "That's right." I said, "Your back is broke." And her mother said, "Oh, she just can't move." I looked out, and I seen the girl going real fast right down across the audience in a vision, going walking real fast. I said, "Stand up, in the Name of Jesus Christ, for THUS SAITH THE LORD, you're healed."

L-16 And she said... Her mother said, "Oh, no, darling. No, no." Said, "If she moves, she'll die. The doctor said she'd die." And the girl jumped up and let out a big scream, and her mother fainted and fell in the same cot. So they just let her lay in the cot, and let the girl go on. Is that right, Brother Bosworth? [Brother Bosworth says, "Uh-huh. Uh-huh. Yes, sure. And the next night I saw this, her back was broke in three places. I saw her in the audience the next night, and waited till I got her eye, for her come up here. And she came up and set. I told her, 'Set on one of these seats back here till Brother Branham comes. I want to introduce you.' And so she set there, and as quick as I saw you come through that side door. 'Come quick, come quick!" And there they took the picture. We have the picture now."--Ed.] That's right. Thank you, brother.

L-17 That she was... Her mother fainted and fell in the same cot, so they just pushed it over, and let her mother lay in the cot while the girl rejoiced in the Lord going up-and-down the place. And a doctor said, "If she moved..." And you know what it is, a back--broken back, an accident on a highway here. Even a--a... No one can move that person 'less the doctor orders it. And you better know what your speaking about before you call such a person too. If that's in your own head, well, something will... That person would kill themselves. But don't worry. If God says so, you move. That's just exactly, 'cause it'll be that way. Well, we would just... Oh, there's so many things happened there in about fifteen minutes, till I just collapsed almost. They taken me to the house. And on the road up, there was a man, Brother Schoeman, men many of you may know him. He was the chairman of the National Committee. And all the churches of Africa was co-operating. They... All but the Dutch Reform church, and that's really a hard church to get along with. If there's any here, I don't mean to say any word about the church, but they don't believe in water baptism; they don't--they don't believe anything hardly. And so, they are just a very formal, ritualistic, cold, indifferent church. 53-1109, Africa Trip Report, National Guard Armory, Owensboro, KY, 59 min

L-18 And so the--the next day, Brother Schoeman going up, which he was--he belonged to the--the Apostolic Faith Missions of Africa. And he was the President of the--of my--of my group. And he was a National Committee. And Brother Schoeman, going home that night, he said, "Oh, I think that was wonderful." But he was telling me that, but yet, I knowed he didn't believe that. I knowed he didn't believe it. And I was going home at his house to stay all night, 'cause there wasn't no places to stay. So I--I went to his house to stay all night. And I went in the room, Brother Baxter said, "Oh," said, "I tell you, this fellow Schoeman is a mighty man." I said, "Yes, he is." But I knowed he wasn't believing that.

L-19 So I, the next morning come out... He was a nice man, but he thought sure that I was--it was mental telepathy, or some kind of a--a trick I had up my sleeve to do it. It was like a rabbits foot or something, you know, you rub on. So he--he... I knowed he was suspicious. And the next morning, I got up, and we went to breakfast. And when we was setting at the breakfast table, I thought... I looked at him again, and caught him this a way to know that I'd catch his spirit. I said, "It's beautiful weather in Africa, Brother Schoeman." Said, "Yes, just very, very, very."

L-20 And I thought, "Ha-ha-ha." You could just feel that little shadow there. I--I knew that he wasn't just exactly where he should be...?... So I thought, "Now, Lord, if You'll just help me to just kind of shake him just a little, then--then it'll make the thing... 'Cause he's the chairman of the committee." And just... I thought, "Well, if You don't, why, it's all right. Just let it go." So, I was setting there eating, and after while the Holy Spirit come down and there broke a vision across the table while we was setting there. I said, "Brother Schoeman, your little girl here, isn't her name Andrea?" He said, "Yes." And I said, "About six months ago, you almost lost her, didn't you?" He said, "Yes, sir." I said, "It was something wrong in her throat." Said, "Yes, sir." I said, "She's had a hard time swallowing since then, hasn't she?" Said, "Say, that's right."

L-21 And--and then It turned around and told him something that I won't say here, 'cause some his friends may be setting here. And he just almost passed out at the table. He said, "Brother Branham, I told Brother Baxter before we come in." He said, "Brother Branham, I was just a little bit skeptic, but I want to reach my hand to you." It was clear then. He--he knew. So the next... That day, we had a marvelous time. The next morning, Brother Baxter and all of us, we come in and he said, "Brother Branham," he said, "I got some news for you." Said, "What?"

L-22 He said, "How would you like to go way down through Kimberly and Capetown, and all around through there, up around through Victoria?" "Oh," I said, "that would be marvelous." He said, "Do you know what? Brother duPlessis has come over and set up an itinerary, all of them, and we're going to take a great big itinerary hundreds of miles down through here." I said, "Marvelous, marvelous, that's just fine." So then, after the service that night, I went home, went in the room, went to bed, went to sleep, and about two o'clock in the morning I woke up, and I heard some kind of a little old bird out the window. And I slipped over and raised up and looked through those reeds to look where--where the birds was. And it was--it was chirping at night. And I thought, "That isn't a nightingale." And I looked at my watch, and it was about two o'clock. I come back and set down, turned on a little dim light and begin to--to read my Bible. And just then, I looked up and here He was standing before me, milling around.

L-23 He said, "Don't you go with them, but you stay right here in Durban." And said, "You... Right here in--in 53-1109, Africa Trip Report, National Guard Armory, Owensboro, KY, 59 min Johannesburg." Said, "You stay here two weeks, and then there's going to be a man by the name of Jackson, is going to take you lion hunting. And you're going out, and you take that week with him and go out and hunt lions, and tigers, and things for a week out in the jungle." Said, "Come back, and then you go over to Durban, a place called Durban, and stay there a month." He said, "Now, that you might know that this will come to pass," he said, "tomorrow morning," he said, "they're going to take you down to this city. And there's going to be a--a little garden like, and a--a native standing there with a purple shirt on." Said, "It's going to be a rare thing. You tell the men that they're going to take you down there." And said, "Then they're going to get a doctor, and they're going to work it around to another minister, and this doctor is going to be a thin man wearing glasses." And said, "The doctors tell him that he's got cancer and dying." But said, "It's an error. It's an error of the doctors. They cut the wrong thing in him, and he's dying because of that." And said, "Don't pray for him, for he's going to die."

L-24 And He said, "Now, and on the road, they're going to take you to another city. And on the road, you're going to meet a girl. She'll be selling beads on the side of the road. She's going to have a great big skin place on the side of her head. And while you're standing there," said, "Mr. Baxter is going to call your attention to a very funny looking big bird making a noise as it goes across the--the plain." And said, "By this, you'll know, and they'll know that you're not to take that itinerary that them ministers has got set up, but you're to go this a way." Well, that settled it. So I went in and woke Brother Baxter up. I said, "Brother Baxter, we can't take that itinerary." Said, "Well, you'll have to tell Brother Schoeman tomorrow." I told Brother Schoeman. And, oh, if you have ever been in Africa, why, that's kinda hard to let them know that, you know.

L-25 Said, "Oh, it's set up." So here come the whole association. That night, the Lord worked a powerful miracle. And the next morning, when we got up, they'd... I'll tell you what the miracle was. I just... As the second night there--third night, it would've been that night, and here's what taken place. Now, this African man, this Boer, had never heard about the Angel of the Lord. Now we got the shirt, got everything to show, the papers and everything, headlines two or three pages in the Dutch Reform church which controls. And the second morning, while we're there, I forget to tell you this. The first night I was there, and the first night I spoke and they seen the miracle, there happened to be a group of the Medical Association out there. And the next morning, the entire Medical Association of all South Africa called me to come to breakfast and give me the right-hand of fellowship, and said, "Brother Branham, that's genuine Divine healing."

L-26 How about that, Brother Bosworth? Huh? "The genuine Divine healing, which we're absolutely not against." He said, "Now, there's many people down here that didn't believe in doctors. We heard you speak for the doctors." Said, "There's been people that we could've helped, Rev. Branham, and we are Christians." He said, "We could've helped them, but they had the--the Christian Science idea that you shouldn't have a doctor." And said, "Through that, they died, many of them. And we believe we could've helped them." And said, "Now, they love you. And you spoke for us," and said, "now, we're speaking for you, and anything that we can do for you, let us know. And every hospital in the whole Transvaal, Free state, Orange state, everything's absolutely open. Anybody that can come; you can go to any hospital. Anything we can do, we'll be right along with you to help you." And they followed me through out entire Africa. And in a few moments, I'll get to the story of the conversion of some of them, and if I can hurry to get my time in now. All right. Now... Or get my story out before my time is up.

L-27 So then, then that same night, there was a... One of these Boer ministers. That's a--a church of the--of the--of the Boer. They called the Dutch Reform church, they went out. He went out to see his friend, and his friend said that I was a spiritualist, mind reader. So he went over to his friend; he said, "God have mercy on you." Said, "It's the hour of visitation to Africa. And you--and you doing such a thing as that." Said, "That's sin." He said, "The man ain't nothing in the world but a polished up soothsayer." And he said, "I'd go out and have prayer for your sinful soul, 'cause God might strike you dead." And he goes out in the kneels down there in a little--a little, I believe it was a peach tree, a little peach tree just about twenty yards from the 53-1109, Africa Trip Report, National Guard Armory, Owensboro, KY, 59 min house, raised up his hands, he... They wear a white shirt, and a white tie. And so, he raised up his hands, said, "God, have mercy on my friend in there. He's going to die and go to hell with such thoughts as that." And--and said, "The hour of visitation is here, and look at him in there. There he is setting there." Oh, he was just telling God all about it. Now, here is the man's story. He said that a Pillar of Light, about two foot long, about eight inches, or ten inches high, of a Light came down, and the Light parted from side to side, and that man described that Angel to a dot. Said, a large Man, two hundred pounds, dark hair to His shoulder, walked down to him and laid His hand on his back. And he said, "When He laid his hand on his back, it felt like that fire had burnt plumb through his body." And he said, "Rise, and tell your friend that this is the hour of visitation, and not to condemn this man."

L-28 So, he jumped up from there, and he said, "Did I go to sleep? Was I dreaming?" And he run and said, "Well, well, I--I don't..." And he run up and begin to tell his friend about it, and his friend looked around, and here was the shape of that Angel's hand scorched in that white, broad-cloth shirt. And the next morning, the man seen it, and they took it, and here was a picture that big in the paper, went plumb through all Africa. I got the shirt now. They called me down, the authorities, checked my hand with it, and every... And there the man's hand, just perfectly a man's hand scorched right through his shirt. We got the shirt. There it was in the African paper. Right away, my. And then, them... They wanted me to leave. Why, I said, "No. The Lord told me stay here." He said for me to stay here. And the next day, when we started out, everything the Lord had said would take place, took place just exactly that way. Even to the little bead salesman. And Brother Baxter trying to take our picture. I said, "Don't you remember that bead salesman I told you?"

L-29 "Oh," he said, "Brother Branham, that's her." Just then something went, "Squawk, squawk." And it was a--a wild peacock, going, flying down through... I said--he said, "Look at that bird there. Wasn't that a funny looking thing, Brother Branham?" I said, "It is." Brother Schoeman said, "That's a wild peacock." And I said, "Do you remember, Brother Baxter, what I told?" He said, "Well, Brother Branham, it's exactly, isn't it?" And I said, "Brother Schoeman, I can't take that itinerary." I said, "I'm sorry to have to interfere with you ministers, but He told me not to take it." Said, "Brother Branham, we have to take it." "Oh," I said, "but, you may have to take it, but--but not me." I said, "No, I don't have to take it, Brother Schoeman."

L-30 The next morning, they're just that persistent, here come the cars right up to go anyhow. Well I, if you go... Brother Baxter said, "Are you going, Brother Branham?" I said, "No, sir." So here they was outside, and my suitcase wasn't packed, nothing. I said, "No. The Lord told me not to go." Well, in come the ministers, and Brother Bosworth knows, we had a round of it. He said, "Well, the meetings are closed here." And I said, "Ridiculous. Right where the Lord's give us the favor and everything, and telling us to stay here, and here's where we're to stay."

L-31 And no, they wanted to go. And so, I put my clothes under my arm and so forth, and we got out, and Brother Bosworth and all of them right along. And we started down, and as we started going, just a hundred and something miles, I said, "What are you going down here for?" "Well, we promised Brother So-and-so we'd be here, Brother..."

L-32 I say this with reverence brother, if you want to get in trouble, just mess with a preacher. You sure get in trouble. So that's right. Now, they're God's servants. They have to be a little suspicious and things. But, brother, I've had more trouble of preachers getting me out of the will of God then anything I've ever seen in my life." Yes, sir! 'Cause one will say, "The Lord..." See, the man's right. If the Lord told him to do that, let him go do it. He may tell me something else. 53-1109, Africa Trip Report, National Guard Armory, Owensboro, KY, 59 min And no matter whatever tells you, if he's a prophet, if he's a preacher, whatever he may be, if God's told you something contrary, don't you pay no attention to that prophet, preacher, priest, or whatever it is; you listen to God. Always listen to God.

L-33 How many ever read I Kings 13, where a little prophet went down and prophesied, and done works of God told him something to do. And another real prophet come to him and told him, said, "The Lord met me and said you come to my house and eat." You know what happened, don't you? Yes, sir. You listen to God, regardless of who says or what says. You listen to God. Well, the minister said, "We promised our brethren that we'd bring you to their town." I said, "What size city is this we're going to?" "About three thousand." "Why, there was ten, fifteen, twenty thousand people out there to go to the meeting. Where are you going to put them?" "Don't know. But we promised brother we'd be there." There you are. I said, "I--I appreciate that. I love our brethren, but God has said...?... [Blank.spot.on.tape--Ed.]...?... miles away, and I knowed the whole crowd would be right over there."

L-34 So, we started down the road, and Brother and Sister Schoeman in the car, and Billy Paul, I believe... No, I was by myself, and I think Billy was back with Brother Bosworth and them. And what... Three or four carloads of ministers coming, kept going on down, the Holy Spirit said, "Are you going to listen to Me?" I said, "Brother Schoeman, stop the car." He said, "What's the matter, Brother Branham?" I said, "Just stop." And he stopped and said, "Well, what?" We way ahead of the rest of them, 'cause he drove like Jehu. So he pulled the brake up and he--and he said, "Well, what's the matter?" I said, "I'm just not going any farther." "Well," he said, "Brother Branham," said, "I don't care for you staying up there." Said... He's the chairman. Said, "That's my city. That's my district." He said, "But the brethren want you to go down there." He said, "They're not going to listen to that, Brother Branham." I said, "Well, I'm going to listen to God, anyhow."

L-35 So, he--he stopped, and up come the brethren. Now, if anybody's here remembers in Shreveport, Louisiana, standing and speaking like this, one day the Holy Spirit come just before going over, and he said, "THUS SAITH THE LORD," to me, "be careful, there's a trap for you in Africa." Well, I thought it was witch doctors and so forth. I thought, "Well, I know Who God is, and witch doctors ain't going to bother me." I didn't know it was among brethren. See? So sly was Satan. And we stopped on the road. Up come Brother Bosworth and Brother Baxter, and all of them stopped, and all them... And Brother Schoeman went back there and said, "You'll have to go see him." Said, "He just refuses to go any farther."

L-36 Well, up come Brother Baxter, and got kind of huffy with me. He said, "Brother Branham, listen." He said, "We're about twelve thousand miles away from home. We're down here at the mercy of these people. And don't you think these ministers, we should consider them?" I said, "As far as considering and being reverent to brothers, we should. But I should look to God first." And he said, "Brother Branham, I--I just--just can't believe that it's exactly right." And then, up comes Brother Bosworth. And Brother Bosworth setting here, now watch, right's right, and wrong... Brother Bosworth said, "Brother Branham, I believe you're mistaken." And I said, "My old saintly dad that stood on the platform with me and watched the visions, and works, and wonders and so forth, and hear me say, 'THUS SAITH THE LORD'?"

L-37 Brother Baxter, Brother Bosworth, lovely, both of them, well, the ministers... Another African minister walked up and said, "Brother Branham, don't you think God speaks to somebody else besides you?" I said, "Yes, Korah had the same idea at one time." I said, "But I don't know what." 53-1109, Africa Trip Report, National Guard Armory, Owensboro, KY, 59 min He said, "God told us to make that itinerary."

L-38 I said, "But God told me not to take it." I said, "He might've told you, but He told me not to take it. And for my part, I'm not going to take it." So then, there we was all hugged together on the road. All right, stopped in the middle of the road, meeting waiting. And I... You remember it, Brother Bosworth. I said, "I'm not going to do it." So, they went on and hum-hawed around. Said, Brother Baxter said, "Well, Brother Branham, I'd go on down to the city at least, and then pray for them people there, and we'll go home." Said, "I'm just through, and tired, and sick." And Brother Baxter's very nervous, you know. And--and he said, "I'm just through with the whole thing. I wash my hands of it." Said, "You can't listen to things like that." Said, "I--I'm through with the managing of it." And I said, "Well, you can be that too." But I said, "I'm going to listen to God, regardless." And God, if I'd only hung with that. See?

L-39 And then, I walked over there, and got some locust leaves off the tree. And pulled the locust leaves down, and put them in my hand, and there stood Brother Bosworth, Brother Baxter, and several ministers. And I walked along with these locust leaves throwing it on their feet. I said, "THUS SAITH THE LORD, from this time on, we're out of the will of God, and it'll be nothing but trouble until we return." Got back in the car crying like a baby, set down in the car, and I held my head down. Brother Schoeman glad to get me back in the car, and so away he went with me again. We got down there in that little city, and there they was laying out there in the fields and hills, no place to go, no place to eat, nothing, laying out there, that great big place back there ready for us, just moved out of it.

L-40 All right. Immediately, Brother Bosworth starts, holding of, kind of give a little beginning of the meeting, and there come up a tropical storm, and liked to drown the whole bunch. And there I was setting down the house, out of the will of God, just as much as Abraham was when he was in Gerar. Just setting down there in the house, I said, "Lord, let them have a lesson of it." So I was just setting there in the house. About midnight, in come Brother Bosworth, drenched. Said, "Oh, my, we tried tonight." I said, "Uh-huh."

L-41 So, the next day... "Oh, that will be all right," they said. "We..." And you've never seen a storm till you hear a tropical storm. You hear our lightning flash, and roar, and after while it--it just clap, clap, clap, clap, clap, clap, clap, clap. It's just like that, the lightning's flashing. Just a constant roar, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, the lightning a going. And there, all of them liked to have drowned, sick people, and everything. So then, the next morning it cleared off. Said, "Oh, this will be fine tonight." And then when it come night time, just about the time they got ready to take me, there come up a cold spell, and liked to froze them all to death. That's right. About ten o'clock, come into the house, eleven o'clock, I said, "Uh-huh." I said, "Now, tomorrow night, we will have an earthquake." I said, "We're out of the will of God, brethren."

L-42 Brother Bosworth, my old saintly dad setting here, setting there at the table, at the round table, we just got into our Brother Fourie's house, and his... I just met his wife setting there at the table. I looked over to his wife, I said, "Lady..." Told her what she was suffering with, what she had, what was wrong with her, and said, "You're healed." And right there, God healed her and made her well. Looked over to Brother Fourie, and told him, that was in their house. I said, "Now, do you believe?" "We believe." But the ministers, they wouldn't... "No. We got to go on. We're going on anyhow."

L-43 Well, we fussed till about two o'clock in the morning, wasn't it, Brother Bosworth. And now, there's many things that I make a mistake, and God, sometimes let's your very best bosom friends, do you know that, wrap right around you. Now, Brother Bosworth was just as sincere. He's setting here, and so is Brother Baxter. But you see, God was giving me a try. So he said, "Somebody..." Brother Bosworth said to me, said, "Brother Branham, I believe now, if you'll go down through that way." They told him they had natives down there. But we didn't know the truth of it. The only place there wasn't any segregation was at 53-1109, Africa Trip Report, National Guard Armory, Owensboro, KY, 59 min Durban. And we didn't know it at the time. Brother Bosworth was looking at it from the natural, ministerial stand point, like, if I'd happen to quit this meeting right here in the next ten minutes and walk away, somebody'd say, "Well, that guy's a hypocrite." You just don't understand. You have to do what the Holy Spirit says. I can't be like some of them sets their meetings up for two or three years ahead of time. I don't know even an hour from now what God's going to have me doing. But, now, whatever He tells me, I'm going to do it by His grace.

L-44 So then, watch this lesson, and then you'll understand. Then, Brother Bosworth said, "Brother Branham, I believe if you'll go on down there, you will see the exceedingly, abundantly, above all that we could do or think, or so forth. That's His word." I said, "Brother Bosworth," I put my hand in his, I said, "As many battles as we've stood together, and I'm telling you in the Name of the Lord Jesus, that we're out of the will of God. And it's going to be nothing but trouble." All the ministers begin to carry on. So they begin to talk about, along about two o'clock in the morning, the permissive will of God. God would permit it. It wouldn't be His perfect will, but being they had put up thousands of dollars for advertisement, rented great big auditoriums and things, big baseball parks and things down through there, why, it was no more than right we should go. Thousands of dollars, and natives was already piling in from everywhere, all down through there. I said, "God can sent then all up here." And we found out later, He--it would've right. But no, they wouldn't listen to that. Huh-uh. No, we had to go anyhow, because they'd promised the brothers.

L-45 So he said, "Do you said they were going to have an earthquake tomorrow night?" I said, "I don't know what we'll have tomorrow night. It's hard to tell what we'll have." And I... Well, they asked the permissive will. I said, "God might permit it, but it'll never be His will." So, I was crying again, so in the room we went. And my little old boy, I don't see him standing here anywhere, but he's in here somewhere in the building. When we walked out of the room, I was alone. He put his arm around me, come out with me. He said, "Daddy, don't you listen to those preachers." He said, "If nobody in the whole country will stand by you, I'll stay with you if we have to hitchhike back home."

L-46 And I said, "Well, Billy, I--I don't know what to do. I... Here we are down here, and these people, and..." If we ever got back, they had to pay the way. So we was--we was out there. I got enough friends in America, I believe, that'd send me a ticket to come home on. I'd pay it back to them later. And I said, "I--I... But if I go back home, I'm still not doing what He told me to do. He told me to stay in Johannesburg." And so I... Billy said, "Well, daddy, I'll stay with you." I said, "Well, come on, let's pray, honey." We went in the room, our room, and there was a great bunch of ministers. They went in their rooms and so forth, and they said, "Go ask the Lord if He will permit you to do it, being we've got everything set up like this. Well, I prayed. Billy went to bed, went to sleep after he got tired. He prayed a little bit, and kid-like, crawled up and went to sleep.

L-47 So, I--I just kept on praying. Along about three or four o'clock in the morning, here He come. I said, "Who are these men? And what do they mean, Lord?" He said, "Go on with them. But you're going to pay for it if you go with them." Said, "You can go. And if you want to go, all right. But remember, you're going to pay for it." He said, "Tomorrow morning, go wake up your boy." He had respect to Billy. If Billy'd only submit his way to God, and believe in God, the ministry of mine would just be a little bitty thing. I know what's in the boy. But he's just in an adolescence age, and he just--he just don't know where he's standing. But I know that boy, setting here the other night, and he said, "Daddy, I was going down the road, and something...?..." He will say, "Daddy, you know... "We never been on this road before." Said, "Right along another place, there's going to be a barn setting at a certain place, and a certain..." Why sure. Be just exactly that way. See? And that gift is laying so close to him, if he'd just move over into it, it would be wonderful. But he's just at that frolic age, you know, and adolescence, and you know what I mean. And so, I pray that God will settle him down someday, and put him on a platform that'll give a ministry that'll just bring millions of souls to Christ. I do. You pray for him too. And so, he's got a lot up front, but I know what Billy is in the back. See? 53-1109, Africa Trip Report, National Guard Armory, Owensboro, KY, 59 min

L-48 So then, we--we... He went in there, and the Angel of the Lord told me, said, "You go, wake up Billy, and tell him that tomorrow morning this storm, or weather is going to clear up. Then at Sunday school, the Sunday school service out on the desert, they're going to ask you to come pray for the sick. He's going... There's going to be a boy come with him..." See, he come so that nobody would talk to me while I'm on--coming on the road, they don't let no one talk when you're under the anointing. And said, "Now, when he comes, he's going to come in a little black car, and there's going to be boy come with him, and he's going to pick up another boy. And on the road down, there's going to be a native standing by a, dressed in a white safari suit at a eucalyptus tree, narrow bridge, he's going to striking another native with a stick. Your boy will call your attention. By that, you know that you're permitted to go. I won't take your life, but you're going to pay for it."

L-49 I went right in, woke up Brother Bosworth. He had a little-little light there that Billy give him. He pressed on. The Lord speaks to him along in the night time with something or the other, he writes it down on a piece of paper so he can have it for the next day. He said he couldn't remember as good as he used to, said he'd have to write it down when the Lord had give him something. And I went in, woke him up, woke up Brother Stadsklev, Brother Baxter, Brother Bosworth, and all of them, the ministers. I said, "THUS SAITH THE LORD, that God has told me that I could go, but I'd pay for it. And our meetings will not be like they should be. But if you're determined, I'm willing to take this, to whatever the--the whipping is to come, but we shouldn't do it." And I told them what exactly the morning would be, and it was still storming then. I said what it'd be. And the next morning, it happened just exactly (Is that right, Brother Bosworth?), just exactly the way the Lord said. Billy come after me the same way, them boys. And he just had his hand back like this. The boy started talking to me, and the boy motioned, my boy motioned his hand not to do that. And I was setting there praying, waiting till he got to the platform. And--and just then, Billy said, he was looking around behind the seat. The driving wheel's on the right hand side, and he was looking this way, had his arm across, and he was setting in the front, another boy, and I in the back. He said, "Daddy, looky there." And there was that native with that white suit on, standing at that eucalyptus tree, near the bridge, fixing to strike the other one. And I said, "What'd I tell you, Billy?" And the little fellow started crying. I said, "Daddy's headed for some trouble for himself, but here we are." I said, "The next time I ever come to this country, I'd better be straightened out 'fore I get here." And I said, "I won't--I won't come if it's not."

L-50 We went on out, had the meeting that day, went on down, at the very next town was Kimberly, wasn't it? A big diamond mine, where the President taken us down, and showed us the mines... And we had about fifteen thousand people, and a little building that would seat half of this. And that Afrikaans minister, Brother Bosworth went to him, said, "Well, isn't there a place?" "No place could get it. And anyhow, we're going to have it in my church. The brethren promised me we can have it in our church." Brother Bosworth said, "Well, ridiculous man." Said. "Look at the streets, they're packed full of people. The fields are standing full of people." Said, "You mean to tell me that you want it in your little old church there that'll seat about three or four hundred, and there around fifteen thousand or more people standing there?" "The brethren told me I could have it in my church, and that's just where it's going to be." And poor old Brother Bosworth, I never seen him out of humor in my life. But he come back up to the house, he said, "Let's take a walk." We went walking. He said, "Brother Branham, did you ever hear of such? It's ridiculous."

L-51 I said, "Of course, Brother Bosworth, that's the exceedingly, abundantly (You see?), that we..." I said, "We're out of the will of God." Brother Bosworth said, "I just can't stand that preacher acting like that." And downtown he went on his own hook, went out there, and rented a great big stadium that seated them every one real nice, had the meeting. Went on down through Capetown, on the road coming back, coming out of Capetown, here the story starts. I got sick, started getting sicker. By the time I got to Durban about two weeks later, I was really sick. I couldn't even hold my head up. And I got to Durban, and their meeting there consisted of a nearly a hundred thousand people, where thirty thousand 53-1109, Africa Trip Report, National Guard Armory, Owensboro, KY, 59 min converts in one day's time. And they said, "We promised Brother So-and-so." Two thousand miles farther up in Rhodesia I should go, after about two or three days meeting in Durban: walk off and leave a hundred thousand natives that had toiled for as many as a hundreds of miles, and packing their loved ones on reeds through the jungles to be healed. That's the exceedingly, abundantly.

L-52 And there, the white and black could come together. They separated each tribe and so forth, but the only place in Africa that you could do it. Is that right, Brother Bosworth? The Holy Spirit knew that all the time, and we didn't. So then, the rest of the meeting, I just barely lived to get home. And when I come home, come to find out, I had an African ameba dysentery, blood just poured just as hard as it could. Nothing would stop it. They was going to throw me the pesthouse when I got to America. They took me in to a doctor and examined me. He said, "It's the worst case I ever saw in my life." He put me in a place, and he give me sixty-days treatment. God just turned His back on me, said, "Go ahead, take it. You wanted it."

L-53 I said, "O Lord, help me. Help me." And He just let me just go ahead and holler. And I just cried and begged and everything else. Didn't do no good. Months passed, just the same, never let up at all. Just kept on. The doctors give me everything they had. And he straightly examined me, he said, "I only got one more treatment, and that's strict arsenic." He said, "I can't give you that very much." He give me seven doses of it, and I turned as yellow as a pumpkin. He examined me again, said, "Reverend, if I give you..." His father was a minister right here in Kentucky, Doctor Lucus, at Louisville, Kentucky, if you'd like to ask him: Doctor Lucus and Ryan. And so he, the best there is on--on ameba in this country. And he said, "Reverend Branham, that's the worst type of ameba." Said, "It's not a germ, it's a parasite. Gets into the stomach, and intestinal tract, and just set there and suck on the--on the intestinal tract till the mucus is gone, then gets in the blood stream, takes your life." So then, and they're in little cones, and when you send medicine down, they just shut up and don't eat it. And I tell you, you never get over it hardly. So then, I... There I was laying there dying. So then, he give me the that. And they give me examination after that. I had more ameba than I had in the first place. Now he said, "Reverend Branham, I don't want to alarm you." Said, "You're a married man, got a couple children, three?" I said, "Yes, sir." He said, "You return home now. There's nothing we can do for you." Said, "There's nothing in the line of medicine that can be done." He said, "Now, if those amebas retire why they--you may go on all right, and have these breaks the rest of your life. He said, "If they go into the farther from the mucus gland into the blood stream, you'll start taking a real high fever. And if they gather on the liver, it'll push out a knot, and you'll get real heavy cramps here. And you let us know right at once, and we'll cut in there and drain that liver out. You'll get over it. But then, if it strikes the brain, or the heart, you'll live ten hours."

L-54 Well, that was a lot of encouragement. I went home. My poor little old wife setting there, and I told her. "Well, what am I going to do? My ministry's ended now. I got two little children to raise: one's seven and the other one two. Now what am I going to do?" That's the exceedingly, abundantly, not obeying God. I walked up-and-down the floors. I've cried. I begged. I persuaded, back and forth, back and forth, got down to about a hundred and ten pounds, just walking back and forth, crying and praying, back and forth, and back and forth on the floor. Got so I couldn't rest at night. Just, every time, I thought I had a fever every five minutes. And--and I just knew the fever was coming. I was laying there, and the little girl and I was in one of the bedrooms sleeping. Wife and the other little girl was in the next bedroom. The hallway's between the bath, setting between the two beds. So in that room, I was laying there. I woke about two o'clock in the morning; I'd been sleeping about a half hour, and I put my hand back like this, and I said, "O God." And I remembered Brother Bosworth when I left Africa. I put my arm around him when we got on the plane. I said, "Well, Brother Bosworth, I have fought a good fight. I've finished the course. I have kept my faith, or the faith." He said... I said, "I guess my days are over." He said, "Well, you're just a brand new Branham." He said, "You're just a boy." Said, "I was your..." 53-1109, Africa Trip Report, National Guard Armory, Owensboro, KY, 59 min I said, "Well, I'm forty-two years old."

L-55 He said, "Well, I was forty years old, 'fore I started preaching here." Said, "Boy, you're just a child." Said, "Here I am, seventy, something," said, "I'm just going strong." Said, "I..." Said, "Well, you just got your education and diploma." Just going on like that, and I thought, "Oh, my." So, I was thinking about what I told Brother Bosworth. I thought, "What if my future holds. I guess it won't be long now till I'll be gone." And I thought, "If fever strike me, ten hours, my wife will be here with two little children to raise, my boy. What will be the outcome of my life?" I was laying there, I started crying. And I'm... place to the vision. I started crying. And I looked up, and I thought, "God, what must I do?" I heard something going, "Wooooo." First time for months and months, I knew He was in the room. I looked around, I seen that Light standing over there by a--a chifforobe, whirling around. I got out on the floor, and I said, "O God, have You come with pardon for Your servant, or have You come to take me away?"

L-56 And just then, I looked coming right down in front of me, must've broke into a vision, here come a man walking to me, with typewriter paper, looked like, in his hands like that. And he walked up, and he said, "Insomuch as you was thinking about your future..." I said, "Yes. I wonder what my future holds." And I looked down on the floor, and something had been wrote on. And he took that typewriter paper like this, and he went... Threw it like that, and just one right after the other like that, and made a complete road up into heaven. And a great voice screamed from above that paper and said, "Your future is clear."

L-57 I come out of it. I begin crying. I said, "O God, if I could just ask Him." He never shows me over one thing at a time like that. And I thought, "Oh, if I'd have just ask Him if I was ever going to get over these things here, if I--if I was going to get over it, and what would it be." I thought, "Oh, if I could..." Here He come back again. And I seen that time, when He come walking to me, I said, "Will I ever get over this fear, this..." Said, "I... Will I ever have it any more?" He said, "Not at all." And when He left that time, I begin to rejoice. And I thought, "Oh, if I'd only asked Him about my meetings. If I'd asked Him about my meetings then. Everybody is telling me, 'Brother Roberts prays for people faster than I do, and more people tends the meeting because more can get prayed for.'" I thought, "Well, what... If I'd just had asked Him that." And I thought, "The next time He does, maybe He's--He's... I know He loves me now. He's back talking to me again." And I said, "If He--if He'd tell me again, well then, ever come..." And just there, here He was again. And I said, "Lord, would--would my Lord let me know, it's always throwed up to me about how I pray for the people." I said, "Should... would You bless the people? You told me that--that the--the gift was to get the people to believe, and then if I be sincere when I prayed, do You want me to lay hands on the people, or just pray for the whole group like Brother Bosworth says, or just--or just one, just wherever I see the vision?" He said, "Just as you're led."

L-58 Then He went away again. And I started rejoicing there, and was real happy. And just then, here He come again and taken me away. Now, listen close, now. Have your paper ready. But when He come this time, He set me down in a Durban meeting, geographically; I was looking just the way the Durban meeting was, looking south. I was in the north. And there was a great Durban meeting, just the same meeting. And I noticed that meeting begin to turn blue, raised up off the ground, the people, and faded away towards the west. Now, I talk slow, now, so the people can get it, and is writing. Faded towards the west... And just then I looked in front of me again this a way, only it was towards the south, and there was a new meeting, greater than the other one was. And there was beautiful people: Men and women with their hands up, a praising God. And I said, "Are all those white people?" And I looked, and I seen the Africans, the great dark race standing in there. And just then, I heard something going, just making a real humming noise, like a dynamo a running.

L-59 And I looked up, and here came another Angel. This One standing by my side was the same Man that always talks. 53-1109, Africa Trip Report, National Guard Armory, Owensboro, KY, 59 min And here come another One from heaven, and He had great oscillating Light turned on. And this Angel caught me by the shoulders and turned me to the east. And as I looked to the east, I never seen so many people in all my life, and they wasn't Africans. They looked like they... They had a--a sheet wrapped around them like this, and just pulled it up and stuffed it down like the Indians wear, up around Calcutta, and up in that way. And they were little bitty, skinny men. And they had their hands up, just a praising God, and a screaming my name as loud as they could to come that way. And I looked, and the Angel that stood just above me then, He was a great, mighty looking Fellow too. And He had this great light in His hand, oscillating. And He turned It on, and It went way back through the hills. And just as far as I could see, was nothing but a solid mass of people. And then, the Angel that was standing near me, when I seen all of that turning that way, He said... I heard the number just as plain as you hear me. He said, "There's three hundred thousand of those in that Branham meeting."

L-60 And I pitched forward in the floor. My strength was gone. I raised up, looked around, and I heard something going... The leaves turning, and I looked, and here come my Bible right down, and It was turned to the same Scripture where I read tonight. And then It was turning back towards the front of the Bible, and as It turned back towards the front part, It stopped on Joshua, the 1st chapter, and a finger begin to read down, point down along the lines. "The Lord thy God is with thee wheresoever thou goest. No man shall stand before thee all the days of thy life: as I was with Moses, so will I be with you. Be very courageous..." And so forth like that, till It read down there, most of the chapter, 1st chapter of Joshua. And then, It went away.

L-61 At that time, I had came to, and I heard somebody knocked on the door; it was my wife setting there. She was knocking at the door, and she said, "Can I come in?" Oh, I thought, "That's strange. My wife asking me to come in." I said, "Yes." She said, "I started in here three o'clock this morning." Now, she's very timid, but is very spiritual. This is the first time this ever happened in our home. She said, "There's Something told me not to go in there, there was a vision going on." And from three o'clock, this was six o'clock, it'd been three hours I was in that vision. And we went out and was talking of it, and I was telling her.

L-62 And my mother-in-law, a saintly, godly, old, Holy-Ghost filled woman, my wife's mother lives just below me; and as she come up to the house, she said, kind of half crying, she said, "Is anything wrong up here?" She said, "The Lord told me to come up here, something had gone on up here." There you are. That's two witnesses. I went down to the bank in New Albany, the two boys are very well acquainted. And little Bob Dennison, I guess you know him at the bank, Union National Bank, and I want to pick up my checks to see if I had any income tax to pay. And when I went out, I noticed him weeping. And I went over to him, I said, "What's the matter, Bobby?"

L-63 He said, "Why, Billy Branham." He knowed of Miss Morgan being healed with cancer. He said, "Billy, most of my people die with cancer in the bowels," he said, "of just bleeding." And said, "Last night, I had a very strange dream. I dreamed that I saw a Man come down from heaven, dressed in white, and told me you was going to be standing here today." That was it. That was all. God in the mouth of three witnesses. It's going to happen, friend. I went home. I called up Dr. Lucus. I said, "Dr. Lucus, I want to come over examination." He said, "What for?" I said, "I'm... I haven't got any ameba." He said, "Oh, yes. You got it, Reverend Branham." Lovely man, one of the best men that you'd want to meet, one of the nicest little doctors, him and Dr. Ryan... And I said, "Well, Dr. Lucus, I'd like for you to examine me." He said, "Well, I just examined you the other day, Bro--Brother Branham." Said, "You got ameba." I said, "Huh-uh." Ha. I said, "Would you give me..." "Oh," he said, "come on over." 53-1109, Africa Trip Report, National Guard Armory, Owensboro, KY, 59 min And I went over, and as busy as he was, he said, "What about it, reverend?" And I said, "I haven't got any ameba." He said, "You just got--you just got a little relief." He said, "You're just..."

L-64 I said, "No, it's not a relief. This is permanent." I said, "I--I--I'm absolutely healed of it." And he said, "Well." And I said, "Will you take another examination?" He said, "Climb up on the table." And he took the smear, went out into the laboratory. Come back, said, "Could I take that again?" I knowed what had happened. He goes down, takes it again, comes back, and he said, "Reverend, you haven't got any." I said, "That's what I told you." And he said, "Well, I have to examine you for three months," said, "'fore I can let you be free." I said, "You can examine me every day, if you want to." I said, "It's all right." And he said, "What happened?" And I set down and told him. I said, "Do you believe that?" Said, "How can I doubt it?" There he was, and I was healed. God called me to... Now, what I've got to do... There's more with it, but I've close now. It's time to start praying for the sick.

L-65 What's happened, friends? Now, I have to go right straight back to Africa, where I started from. I... There in Von Vonblumburg, I have a little dinner with the Prime Minister of India, Nehru, then I go into India. The archbishop, which is to be with us in this next meeting, down here the Baptist and Methodist is sponsoring here in Florida, Dr...?... Lee of the big Baptist school there. They're sponsoring this meeting at West Palm Beach, just the fundamental churches alone. And the archbishop of India come over here to find out a lot of Indians was converted and healed there. He come over to find out whether it was true, and he receive the Holy Ghost himself. He's going to be with me in the meeting. Don Wells, the one that wrote me...?... received the Holy Ghost. Dr. Reedhead, the President...?... of the great Sudan Missions received the baptism of the Holy Ghost in my front room. See? Now, he said, "Brother Branham, the move is on."

L-66 So, some of them, when I said, "...?... Lee" they thought it was Doctor Lee at Memphis. So they wrote there and told them, "Oh, no. Certainly Doctor Lee wouldn't believe that?" I said, "What about it?" I said, "If he wants to travel in a ox cart, let him go on. We're in a jet plane. Let's move on. We're a different type of Baptist. Let's go on." The move is on. God is a moving among His people. And that's why here in America right now, we're trying to accumulate enough finance to put the road back to Africa again, India, and so forth. And mark it in your Bible, that you will hear this, that I was in India, or somewhere east of Africa, Tanganyika, somewhere where Indians are at, somewhere in that eastern country which I believe will be India, itself, where there'll be three hundred thousand people, either they will be attending the meeting, or they'll be... The archbishop told me, said, "Brother Branham," said, "that's three hundred thousand conversions." He said, "Because I assure you, there'll be a million in your meetings." Said, "Everybody's looking for you." I said, I had a little luncheon down there with--with E. Stanley Jones, many of you know him, Dr. Stanley Jones. He said, "Oh, it won't work in Africa," he said, "or in India." He said, "I tell you," said, "The--they--it just won't work," said, "They don't believe the Pentecostal message." I said,"I don't say nothing about Pentecostal message. I was talking about what the Lord told me." He said, "Well..." I told the Archbishop, said, "What's he done? Got two or three little old, cold, formal churches sitting up there, with a dozen in each one." Said, "Come on Brother Branham, they're waiting for you." So we're ready to go, soon as God gives the sign now. We just about got enough finances, a little bit. We'll be ready to go after awhile, as soon as we get finished. And then, we're going back to India. And you watch "The Voice of Healing", "Healing Waters", and many of those papers, it'll carry the article, that that vision will be just exactly the way 53-1109, Africa Trip Report, National Guard Armory, Owensboro, KY, 59 min it said. Now, what does it do? Friends, no matter what it takes, by God's help, I promised God and many trials I've had since then to come in the test, I'll keep God's Word. When God tells me to do anything, I'll do it. I've learned my lesson. And you do the same. When God tells you anything, you go do what God tells you do, regardless of how foolish it seems to other people, you believe it with all your heart. Let's bow our heads.

L-67 Now Father, before this audience, it's very hot in here tonight, and the air is very contaminated with, seems with heat, and the intense heat here is very bad. But the people are sitting, waiting, watching. They're hungering, their cups are up. May this be the night, that You Who stood by Thy servant there in Africa, to watch the thousands and thousands be healed at a time; may the eyes of this American people see it again tonight; of the people that's here sick and afflicted be healed. God may they understand that it--it's by committing their lives to You, and their faith to You, and walking by faith, not by sight. Sight is not faith, it's an enemy to faith. But, "Faith is the substance of things hoped for, the evidence of things we don't see." So God, I pray now, by reading the Word, giving the testimony, and now Holy God of heaven, I pray that in this crucial hour, one more meeting with these lovely people around Owensboro. May never see them again no more in my life, till I meet there at that great Gate, Where I trust that You'll welcome us, every one, home. I pray that You'll just do something special tonight Lord. It is Saturday night, road houses are packed out, the night clubs, the whisky places, beers, drinking. Sinful men and women, boys and girls carousing the streets. The tears dropping from Your own cheeks, looking down. But Lord, these who gathered here are not that way. They're sick, Lord. They're needing help. And I tried my best to tell them that You've already healed them, if they'll just accept it, and believe it. They're every one healed, was healed many, many years ago, when You died. May they renounce the Devil tonight, rise in the Name of the Lord Jesus and walk and be made well and healthy. And may for weeks and weeks to come, the people around through the community here will be seeing that the diseases has gone from them, maybe they don't even recognize it now. But in this great room here where the power of God has bottled down, Satan can no more stand where faith is than a person could exist where tear gas is falling; it'll have to go out. So, I pray that this room will become so filled with the Holy Ghost, until every spirit of doubt will turn the people loose, and the cripples will walk, and the blind will see, the deaf will hear, cancers will be cured and heart trouble, Lord. Some of these people... the heart trouble isn't going to live but just a day or two longer maybe, if You're not with them. Try once more Lord, to break into their hearts, will You? Give them real faith to believe. And help Thy servant now, by this Divine manifestation, that it might be known that Thou art Christ, and I'm Your servant, for I ask it in Jesus' Name. Amen.

L-68 We don't have very much room here to stand many at a time. Now, how many's here for your first time, let's see your hands, first time? Where's everybody was here last night? Every night it's practically a brand new audience. You can just repeat the same thing over each time, it would do. All right, friends, I'm not a healer. I'm your brother. Please understand, I never come here to heal people, I come here to point them to One Who's already healed them, Jesus Christ. By Divine... but if He was here Hisself, He could not heal you, could He? He can't do what He's already done. If I put my hand on that Bible, you say, "Put your left hand on the Bible, Brother Branham." Th... I can't do it, I've already got it on there. If the requirements me to put my hand on the Bible, why, my hand's on the Bible. You say, "Why, you put your hand on the Bible." I've already done it, see. Well, that's what Jesus... He healed the people, and He saved the people. When you get saved, Jesus doesn't come down and save you then. You've been saved ever since Jesus died, but you just accepted your salvation. It'll never do you any good unless you accept it, that's right. But when He died, He took away every sin of the world. And as far as God is concerned, He can't see sin, because the Blood of Christ got it covered. But when you die, and you go beyond that Blood, then you're already judged. Cause, God's done said the day you eat thereof that day you die; so if you're... you didn't accept the Blood of Christ, you didn't accept your salvation from Christ, then you're just gone, that's all. If you did, then you're saved, and that--that settles it.

L-69 And now, the same Blood, and mingled in there through His stripes, you were healed. If you believe it, accept it, 53-1109, Africa Trip Report, National Guard Armory, Owensboro, KY, 59 min no matter how you feeled. It isn't by feeling, never think... Jesus never did one time say, "Did you feeled it?" Said, "Did you believe it?" That... No matter how you feel you just believe it. You're not saved because you feel like you're saved, are you? I'm not saved because I feel like I'm saved. The Devil can beat you around the bush on your feelings. Brother, I'm saved because I met God's requirement. That's why I'm saved. Let me see him beat me around that. That's what God said. My feelings, that has nothing to do with it. But the Bible said I'm saved, and I met that requirement, and that's the reason I know I'm saved. Course there is a feeling that goes with it, but not the feeling alone; it's the Bible said so. That's the reason... Jesus said when He... how many believe He was God in flesh, let's see your hands? We all believe that, sure we do. He was--and when He was here on earth, He had all the powers of God, was in Him, do you believe that? He was the Godhead bodily, the Fullness of the Godhead bodily. The Bible said, "God was in Christ, reconciling the world to Himself." Is that right? Jesus said, "It's not Me that doeth the works, it's My Father dwelleth in Me, He doeth the works." And when He met the Devil, He had every power that God's got, was right in Him. But He never used a one of them. He said... Satan said, "If?" (That question mark.) "the Word of God's right. If, if Thou be the Son of God, do a miracle and let me see You do a miracle." Hmm? He still says the same thing. "If Thou be the Son of God, command these stones to be turned to bread and eat, 'cause you're hungry. You have need of it." See?

L-70 Jesus said--never said, "Now, I have power to overcome you," He said, "It's written, man shall not live by bread alone," the Father's Words, see, "But by every Word that proceedeth out of the mouth of God." Satan took Him up on the pinnacle and said, "If Thou be the Son of God..." Jesus said, "It is written..." He taken Him up on a man--mountain, showed Him all the kingdoms of the world, United States and all, said, "They're all mine." Jesus knowed that they were his. Said, "I do with them whatever I want to." You can see what he's doing with them, just whatever he wants to. He said, "They're mine. And I'll give them every one to You, if You'll fall down and worship me." Jesus know in the millennium, He's going to fall heir to it anyhow, so He said, "It is written, thou shall worship the Lord thy God, and Him only shall thou serve. Get thee hence, Satan." Is that right? He defeated Satan on the Father's Word, is that right? Bringing It to show that the weakest of Christians, can defeat Satan on THUS SAITH THE LORD, out of the Word of God. No matter what you feel, what you think; THUS SAITH THE LORD, "It is written". Now, look what the Bible said. Jesus said, "Whatso..." Luke 11:24, "Whatsoever things you desire..." Now watch, healing, whatever it is. "Whatsoever things you desire, when you pray, believe, you receive it." Is that right? Then it is written, isn't it? Then I pray, that ask God to heal me. I have a legitmate reason; I want to preach His Gospel; I want to live for Him, I ask Him to heal me. Then I believe I'm healed, and just go on and act like it, and God does the work. That settles it. It'll do it for you, brother, it'll do it for you, sister. It'll do it for you, it'll do it for you, it'll do it for you, it'll do it for every one of you.

L-71 It'll never fail. If it fails than God can fail, 'cause no man's any better than his word, is that right? I'm no better than my word, neither are you. You can't take my words, have nothing to do with me, because I'm no good. I'm just as good as my word, and God's just as good as His Word. If I can't take His Word, I can't have nothing to do with Him. So if His Word's right, He's right. And He's... This is Him. That's just the fruit of God, placed on a paper. And you receive It spiritually into your heart, and believe It, and It'll materialize and bring just exactly what God said It would do. Every seed will bring it's kind. Any... Now, listen to this now, then we'll call the prayer line. Now, listen close now. The right mental attitude towards any Divine promise of God, will bring it to pass. If you'll take the right mental attitude towards any promise in that Bible, it'll bring it to pass. But it's up to you, it's to each individual. All right, ho--what prayer cards you give? A, one to a hundred. All right, who's got A-1? Prayer card A-1, look at your prayer card. A little card, on the back, got an A on it. Who's got prayer card A-1? This--this man here? All right, A-2, prayer card A-2, rise up. A-3, where's prayer card A-3? You have it, sister? A-4, who has prayer card A-4? [Blank.spot.on.tape--Ed.]...?... 53-1109, Africa Trip Report, National Guard Armory, Owensboro, KY, 59 min

L-72 And He knows what's wrong with him, and He--He--He could reveal it, if He wish to. If He doesn't, I can't help it. I can only do. But what if God... Are we strangers, my--my brother? We don't know each other, we've never seen each other. All right, now does anybody, the audience know this man? Anybody here know him? Yes, people knows him here, all right. If--if God has did what I say He has done, then He can reveal to me what's wrong with this brother, and why he's sick, and what's wrong, or what's ever he--he has need of. God can do it. And if God will do it, not only him, but the rest and those out there in the audience, out in there also, if He'll do that, will you all accept Him as your Healer tonight? Say, "This time settles it." You people, will you raise your hands, say, "I'll accept it, I'll believe it with all my heart. If You--if You'll just do it." All right, now, want you to... Now, it's reason I talk to you a little bit before this time, first thing, I'm waiting for the Angel of the Lord; which I'm absolutely, perfectly helpless without Him. But I know with Him, I can do all things. And I know, when He comes here, then a little while I become unconscious. Not as--I--I know what's going on, or He... Now tomorrow, some of them will tell me, "You know what taken place in the meeting? Certain, certain thing taken place, you remember that?" I sit down, go to thinking about it, just like you dreamed a dream. Now, probably there's about twenty people I guess, standing there in the line. Maybe they'd probably be twenty or thirty out there in the audience tonight will be healed; twenty or thirty visions and so forth, and when all those things. Now, what if you dream forty dreams tonight, and somebody ask you tomorrow, what'd you dream about, see. Now, that's just the way it is.

L-73 Now be reverent, everybody just--be just as reverent as you can. And believe God with all your heart, and God will take care of the rest. Now, I want you to look this a-way. And now, don't make a disturbance, if you possibly can. [Brother Branham speaks to someone on platform--Ed.] Is something wrong?...?... All right, ri--just something wrong with this speaking or something down there, they were fixing it. Now, don't watch them. Watch this a-way now, give me your attention. How many's praying for me out there? Do you realize, course in a group of this type, there's critics sitting, without doubt, that's true. Many times... Here a few nights ago two real cold critics, one a woman and one a man, I started twice to say something to them. But sometimes when I do they get up and stomp out. Jesus said, "If you pull the wheat up, or the weeds up, the tares..." They got friends, they were from this very city.

L-74 I talked to one of the pastors, said, "Well, I'd have called it." Yeah, I've--right up here in Kentucky, the reason I haven't had a meeting in a long time, and right here in Tennessee, because two outstanding men of a great meeting, right in Memphis, Tennessee today. Reason I never had a meeting there is because of that one thing; that man that sitting right there, a great overseer of the church. I said, "You're an unbeliever and you're..." Boy, he ducked his head down. He become angry and turned his whole congregation, and said, "That man ain't nothing but a spiritualist, you see." And course he's got friends, if I'd just kept still, kept it to myself, it'd been all right. But I called him out. And he sent one of his district men in, and he was an unbeliever, sat in the back of the building in--in night after that. The Lord pointed him back out, that's been seven or eight years ago, and said, "You're an unbeliever, too." Sitting there, told him who he was and where he was from and all about it. Then that caused a great influence around the country. I didn't mean to hurt the men, but they went right out and confessed. Sure they was unbelievers, that didn't believe in it. But see, it's best to let it alone, so in here you hit critics. It's best to let them alone, let God deal with that. It's up to God, whatever He says, don't you think so?

L-75 Now, be reverent. Now, sir, I want you to look at me just a moment. Now, I'm just going to talk to you like our Master did the woman at the well. He said, "Bring Me a drink of water." I believe that was for a purpose, don't you think so? He said, "Bring Me a drink of water." And she said, "Why, it's not customary for you Jews to ask Samaritans such. We have no dealings." He said, "But if you knew Who you were talking to you'd ask Me for a drink." And she said, "Well, the well's deep..." and the conversation went on. 53-1109, Africa Trip Report, National Guard Armory, Owensboro, KY, 59 min Finally He went right straight to her spot and told her where her trouble was. She acknowledged that was the truth, and by that was converted and helped. Now, if He's raised from the dead, now, what I think He was doing; my own way of thinking. He was contacting her spirit. We are both spirits, we know that brother, we're both spirits. And then if there's anything that God can help you to... I tell you now, it's not you that's concerned, it's this boy. That's where the concern is, it's to the child. And you're very much alarmed about the child. The child must have Divine help, if he stays. You're aware of that sir. Have mercy, God have mercy. The little fellow aware what's wrong? I should keep it to myself then, you think so? The bowels, it's tumors, they're subject to malignancy. The little boy's got to have help from God, if he stays here. Those things true my brother? If they are would you raise your hand, and say that they're true, just as you put up your hand, to signify that...?...

L-76 If Jesus was here, you'd run that little boy to Him as hard as you could. I got a boy standing there, two little girls at home, one about that size. He'd lay His hands upon the child, and bless it. He'd know what was wrong with the child. But now He's went to God and returned back again in the form of the Holy Spirit, and He's the One Who knows all about the child. You believe He sent me to pray for the child? You do believe, bring me your boy then. Come here, sonny. Oh God, this poor, little lad standing here, Satan determined to harm and hurt this little thing. This, I pray for mercy. Bless this little boy, and may the power of Satan turn him loose. Lord Jesus, I pray that we find favor with You now, as everyone is in prayer. And we're in deep sincerity Lord, knowing that the great Spirit that's moving in this building now, knows all things and can do all things. And now Father, in commemoration of Thy Word, I lay my hands upon this little lad. Thinking of my own self, I lay hands over his little stomach. Now, I ask as Your servant to give me mercy. And Thou has said, "I'll give you power over devils, you'll tramp on the heads of scorpions, and nothing shall harm you." And You said, "In My Name they shall cast out devils." And I believe You Lord, and help now, in the Name of Jesus Christ. And now Satan, you who bound this child, but you're going to lose. Christ has already won the victory over you. You cannot hold this child. Thou demon, turn this baby loose. Come out of it, in the Name of Jesus Christ. I adjure thee, as God's servant, that you'll go from this child, and leave it alone. I rebuke thee, Satan, leave the boy, through Jesus' Name. Amen. Come here just a minute, sonny boy. Let me have his hand. You believe with all your heart you're going get well, honey boy? Sure you...?... All right, God bless you. I want to hear from your boy in a little bit. Next few days, you write me a letter and tell me what's happened to the boy. God bless you, brother. Let's say, "Thanks be to God."

L-77 Howdy do, sir. Do you believe, with all your heart? It's a child, look here honey. When Jesus was here on earth, He met little girls like you, and He put His hand on them and blessed them and--and they just got well. You believe that? You believe it? Come here a minute, Brother Branham wants to talk to you a little bit. You believe Jesus will make you well? Oh, He's--He's really loves you, do you believe that, honey? I think you're a very sweet little girl. I want you to look right here at me, just a minute. And now, if Jesus was here, He'd put His hands upon you, you'd get well, wouldn't you? Hmm? You believe Jesus sent Brother Branham here to pray for you? You do. Bless your little heart. Isn't she a darling? Sweet, little thing, now be reverent. I'm trying to shut myself into a vision for the child. Now honey, I got a little girl... what's your name? Well, isn't that pretty? I got a little girl named Rebekah, and one named Sarah. And Rebekah's about your age, and she loves Jesus real well. You love Jesus real well too, don't you? You like to go to Sunday school? You believe when your teacher told that, when Jesus was here He went around put His hands on little children and they got well, didn't they? If He was here, He'd put His hands on you and you'd get well, wouldn't you? The little girl, has a deformity over the heart, which is ribs, about three missing ribs from over her heart. She has a mother also that's real sick, nervous sick. Was it true? Correct? You believe He will heal her now? Come here. Lord, look at this little darling here; poor, little thing standing here. I'd--I'd just do anything Father, to see her well. And I pray that You'll heal her, and may she and her loved ones and all of them be made completely whole tonight. Grant it 53-1109, Africa Trip Report, National Guard Armory, Owensboro, KY, 59 min Lord. And now I rebuke the Devil, that's bound this child. Leave the little fellow, come out of this, you sinful thing. Why, you're whipped by Calvary. Jesus Christ won the victory over you, and I adjure thee by the living God that you depart from this child, and she'll live to be a normal woman, in Jesus Christ's Name...?... God...?... All right, God bless you, brother. You'll find your wife well. God bless you. Let's say, "Thanks be to God." God, Who raised up His Son, Christ Jesus, can do all things exceedingly, abundantly. Do you believe? Are you praying out there?

L-78 You look so sincere about it, brother. Do you believe that God's going to make you well? If God will reveal to me what's wrong with you from here, will you believe, and accept your healing? He's wanting to heal you right now. The man with the white shirt on, sitting there. You're the one was sitting there praying, looking towards me. The man sitting right here, I'm looking straight at... That's it, that man...?... there's the man. Looks to me like that audience could see that light hanging right by the man. Sir, you suffer with something the skin disease, a breaking out of the skin. Isn't that right? If that's right, raise up your hand. Do you accept your healing now? Jesus Christ make you whole, and go home and get well. Be made well, in Jesus Christ's Name.

L-79 Believe, have faith in God. Now be reverent as you can. All right lady, do you believe me to be His servant? I won't be able to talk much, the--it's getting--the Anointing's getting...?... [Brother Branham refers to a PA noise--Ed.] This microphone's alive. I want you just believe me. Look this way, do you believe me to be His servant? You believe if God could reveal to me, your sickness and what's wrong with you, that you'd accept it? You believe with all your heart? I see a man, he must be your, it--it--it--it's your boy, your son. And it--he--he's gone wrong. And he's gone to drinking and--and--and you've tryng to persuade him to church, and he keeps shaking his head and going back from a--a church. And--I--your hu--th--your husband, you're--you're ho--you're talking lou--he's deaf, or something, hard of hearing, isn't that right? Go home, Jesus Christ is going to give you the desire of your heart. God bless you...?... in Jesus Name.

L-80 All right, be reverent, have faith, believe with all your heart. Brother, it's not far away, just keep believing. Oh, a thread would do it, this... Come lady. Mother, could receive your faith at this time it would be over. Your faith is so strong, it's turned me around twice. You believe, lady? Now, your sickness, if that's what it is, I couldn't heal it. I'm just a man. I'm your brother. But your life, you couldn't hide. You know that. Cause, you're--you're--you're knowing that you're in the presence of Something besides your brother. You're--you're ready for an operation and the operation is from the female. And that's a tumor in the female. Now, just a minute, there's something happened. I seen something... was that true what was said? Now, that was--that wasn't me, that was my voice, but it wasn't me, it was a vision. I never seen you in my life, but there was something taken place, and I didn't... Here it is. You have a--you have a child, a little girl about six or seven years old, that has some kind of a coughing, asthmatic is what it is. Your husband's kind of a thin man, he has the same thing and a bronchical condition. Kind of a--a, he's dressed, kind of a--he's kind of a thin-like man. Come here, just a minute, close to me. There they sit, stand up. Our Heavenly Father, Who knows all things, and made all things by Jesus Christ, I pray that You'll bless this family, and may they be healed and made well for Your glory, in Jesus Name, I pray. Amen.

L-81 God bless you, sir. God bless you, lady. May He be with you, and help you. You are... There is something else. You've a--You're just newly in the Way. You've been baptized. But you haven't received the Holy Ghost, but you're seeking the Holy Ghost. Won't you go put your arm around your husband, and may God give you the Holy Ghost before you leave the building tonight, my prayer. God bless you. Go and may His grace be with you. You love Him? Everyone just reverent, and believe with all your heart. Now, don't be excited, just take your time. Pray, have faith. You believe, sister? I--I seen you go in somewhere, and it left me. Everybody in prayer, just silently. You believe that God could reveal to me your very life? And if Christ is risen from the dead, that He could tell me what's wrong with you, and by doing so, would you accept it? Oh, it's a doctor's office now, and it's a child, a little child that's got... it's a throat. It's examining the--in the throat. It's something like colds, or bronchical or something in the throat, 53-1109, Africa Trip Report, National Guard Armory, Owensboro, KY, 59 min and they...

Lord, I--I pray God, that you'll grant to her the--the--her desires, may she go tonight and be made well. Grant it Lord, for Your glory, in Jesus Christ's Name I ask it. Amen. God bless you, lady. Don't doubt.

L-82 Hi, little boy, have faith my brother. Honey, you believe me to be God's servant? You believe God will show Brother Branham, what you're here for? You love Jesus? You believe He died to--to save you, and make you well and make you happy, and a fine man to serve Him? You believe that? I see a wheelchair rolling. A little boy's fixing to go to a wheelchair, no he's just come from a wheelchair, cot and a wheelchair, the little... it's a diabetes. Is that right, honey? Didn't I--did...

Pray that You'll make him every whit whole. May he go home now, and be well. I bless him, and rebuke this Devil, that would take this little boy's life, and send him to a premature grave. Come out of him, Satan. In the Name of Jesus Christ, leave the child. And I bless thee, my son, in the Name of Jesus Christ for your healing. May you go and be a fine, young man.

L-83 When I get weak, Satan just tries everything. You all pray. You believe, with all your heart? You want to get over that female trouble? Believe that God will make you every whit well, and heart trouble, and things you been suffering with? You believe that God will make you well of it? Come here.

You believe if God would show me like He did His Son, Jesus? Straight to your trouble, and God would heal you. You believe that I'm able to do this through Christ, through a Divine gift? All right, you have ulcerated stomach, is that true? I see you refusing food and walking back. Now you're walking towards the table. Go ahead, and eat. God bless you, be made well. Come lady. If God will reveal exactly what's wrong with you, will you accept it? You got heart trouble. You accept your healing? Go on your road, and be healed, I ask in Jesus Name. Amen.

You can go home now and get well. Have faith! You want to get over the sinus trouble, lady? You do? All right, stand up and accept your healing. God bless you.

Say, "I accept it in Jesus' Name." Go off the platform now and be made well, through Jesus Christ's Name. Come lady. You believe? You want to get over the arthritis? Raise up your hands.

L-86 Seen someone move across there, as a shadow, an elderly person with a cane in their hand. There stands the lady, standing behind the man. Look on me lady, just a minute. You believe me to be God's prophet? Not only you're crippled up, but you have heart trouble, too. Isn't that right? If it is take your cane and wave it up in the air. Now you don't have to have your cane no more. You can go home, be made well, in the Name of the Lord Jesus. Stomach trouble, don't you sir?

God bless you then, go, turn right back around, go off the platform, be made well, in the Name of the Lord Jesus. You believe with all your heart? I'm all right, just a minute. All right, I want you to do something for me...?... How many sick peoples here? Now just keep your hands up, sick people. Now you who are sitting near those people with their hands up, lay your hands over on them. Lay your hands over on the sick, everywhere. Now bow your heads, will you? Our Heavenly Father, it is written in the Scripture, "They shall lay their hands on the sick, and they shall recover. Pray one for another, that your... may be healed, for the effectual, fervent prayer of a righteous man availeth much." My strength is gone, but Thou art strong. Thou art here, to make every-every feeble spirit leave the people. Make every evil one go out of them. You see them with their hands on one another, Lord. And if it breaks the heart of a person like me, how would it break Your poor heart, to see these dear mothers and daddies, and hundreds of them here with their hands laying on one another? Why Satan, shame of you, for crippling up those people, and for making them have heart trouble and sickness, where they can't get around. God rebuke thee. You're a deceiver, and you're evil. As a servant of God, I rebuke thee, in the Name of Jesus Christ, that you leave every person here, come out of them. You can't hold them any longer. They believe. God has sent His Word. He sent His Spirit. He sent His signs and wonders. And you're defeated, and I claim it for them everyone; that there'll not be a feeble person, that the lame will get up from here and walk, that the deaf and dumb will go to speaking and hearing, that the blind will see, and all will be made well. Grant it Lord, in Jesus Name I rebuke all the devil power. Courtesy of Living Word Broadcast P. O.
