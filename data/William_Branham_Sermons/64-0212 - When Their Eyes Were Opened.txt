--- TRANSCRIPT ---

L-1 Our Heavenly Father, we pray now that You'll receive glory out of our gathering together. We thank You for the opportunity. Bless Thy Word as It goes forth each night. Bless Thy people as they hear It. And may the great Holy Ghost take a hold of The Word that falls into the heart, and make It to manifest Itself, that literally hundreds of people, through the country here, may be saved. Hundreds of them that are suffering, laying in the shadows of death, may see a great Light spring up, and may they be healed, and Thy great Name honored. That's why we're here, Lord, is not for honor for ourselves, but to honor Jesus Christ among us. For we ask it in His Name. Amen.

L-2 Now as you get in your Bible, just for a few moments. And each night now I'll just speak about twenty to thirty minutes. I have been for the last few weeks. And just speak a very few minutes, and then we'll call prayer line, pray for the sick, or whatever the Holy Spirit leads.

L-3 And how many will, you're first-time comers tonight, and all of you together, will pray for the meeting, will you do that? We're not here just... we're--we're here because we're trying to help. Brethren, I believe, the Lord helping us, we'll have a great meeting to honor our Lord and Saviour.

L-4 We believe He's coming, rightaway. If He isn't here tonight, I'll be looking for Him in the morning. If He isn't here by tomorrow night, I'll be here, the Lord willing. And then if He isn't here, I'll look for Him tomorrow night. And then if He isn't here, I'll look for Him the next night. I want to. I've been looking for Him for thirty-three years now, big part of my life, and I'm not discouraged. I'm watching, day by day, and hour by hour, for Him to appear.

L-5 Now as we turn in the Bible, in the Book of--of Saint Luke, the 24th chapter, beginning with the 13th verse. Let us stand, in honor of the Word, while we read. Saint Luke 24, beginning with the 13th verse. Now if some of you have your Bibles, some of them likes to keep the minister's text, where he speaks from. And now I want you to listen close. Read with me if you can, to yourself, while we read. And, behold, two of them went the same day to a village called Emmaus, which was from Jerusalem about threescore furlongs. And they walked together... all of these things which had happened. (I beg your pardon.) And they talked together of all these things which had happened. And it came to pass, that, while they communed together and reasoned, Jesus himself drew near, and went with them. But their eyes were holden that they should not know him. And he said unto them, What manner of communications are these that ye have one to another, as you walk, and are sad? And the one of them, whose name was Cleopas, answered, said unto him, Art thou only a stranger in Jerusalem, and hast not known the things which are come to pass... in these days? And he said unto them, What things? And they said unto him, Concerning Jesus of Nazareth, which was a prophet mighty in deed and word before God and all the people: ... now the chief priests and the rulers delivered him to be condemned to death, and have crucified him. But we trusted that he had been he which should have redeemed Israel: and beside all this, to day is the third day since these things were done. Yea, and certain women also of our company made us astonished, which were early at the sepulchre; And when they found not his body, they came, saying, that they had also seen a vision of angels, which said that he was alive. And certain of them which were with us went to the sepulchre, and found it even so as the women had said: but him they saw not. Then said... Then he said unto them, O fools, and slow of heart to believe all that the prophets have spoken: 64-0212, When Their Eyes Were Opened, They Knew Him, Elliott Auditorium, Tulare, CA, 78 min Ought not Christ to have suffered these things, and to entered into his glory? And beginning at Moses and all the prophets, he expounded unto them... all the scriptures the things concerning himself. And they drew nigh unto the village, where they went: and he made as though he would have gone further. But they constrained him, saying, Abide with us: for it is towards evening, and the day is far spent. And he went in to tarry with them. And it came to pass, as he sat at meat with them, he took bread, and blessed it, and brake it, and gave to them. And their eyes were opened, and they knew him; and he vanished out of their sight. And they said one to another, Did not our hearts burn within us, while he talked with us by the way, and while he opened unto us the scripture? And they arose and went the same hour, and returned to Jerusalem, and found the eleven gathered together, and them that were with them, Saying, The Lord is risen indeed, and has appeared unto Simon. And they told what things were done in the way, and how he was known to them by breaking of bread. [Luke 24:13-35]

L-6 Let us bow our heads. Lord Jesus, we pray that You will make Yourself known to us in like manner, tonight, as we wait upon Thee. In Jesus' Name we pray. Amen. You may be seated.

L-7 For a subject from that, I would like to take these words: When Their Eyes Were Opened, They Knew Him.

L-8 Now we're speaking, of course, of the resurrection, which is believed amongst all Christian believers today. It's the hope of the Church. If Christ did not rise, then we are lost. And Christianity is based upon resurrection, now, not replacement. Resurrection! For instance, this motel key here, if I drop that on the floor, and said, "Well, I dropped it, I'll place another one like it here," that isn't resurrection; that's replacement. See? Resurrection is "bring up the same thing that went down." And God raised Him up on the third day. And we believe that with all of our heart, and we believe the Bible story. [I Corinthians 6:14], [II Corinthians 4:10-14], [Romans 8:1-15]

L-9 And notice, on this first Easter morning, Jesus is alive among them, from among the dead.

L-10 What a beautiful thing! How I'm so glad tonight to punctuate that with an "amen," that I believe He is still alive among us, in the springtime of the glorious Gospel of Christ. I believe He is still alive. [Revelation 1:18]

L-11 I believe that that's been a... Yeah. That was the springtime of the resurrection, also, of life, of man. Man always feared death; they had no assurance of ever coming back again after dying. [I Corinthians 15:51-58]

L-12 But seeing Him die at Calvary, then being raised up again and was with them, walking among them on this glorious day. After the heartaches and sorrows, and so forth, that they had went through, and them dark hours of seeing Him crucified and spit on, and made fun of, and all that He had went through in those three and half years, and them closing hours of darkness that made Him... Those Pharisees, they hated Him, anyhow, and they was rejoicing because they thought they had finished it, and here He appears among them! My, what a day! I'd... [Luke 24:13-50]

L-13 Wouldn't you like to a-took a trip with Cleopas and them, on the road to Emmaus? I'd a-liked to a walked with them. And it's possible. I'm glad to be a living today, that I can still do the same thing, walk with Him today just the same as they did then. [Luke 24:13-50]

L-14 The thought of it, was, how that Jesus had raised up from the dead. But the sad part of it, was, some of them who loved Him, didn't know it. [Luke 24:1-12]

L-15 And that's certainly a picture of today. There is many people who love Him, who doesn't yet realize that He is alive. They, it's some kind of a history that they have learned in some school. It's some book of theology, some ethics, code of ethics, that they studied somewhere, and Jesus is a historical figure to them. And yet, in the history, they love 64-0212, When Their Eyes Were Opened, They Knew Him, Elliott Auditorium, Tulare, CA, 78 min Him, and don't realize that He is alive with us, walking right around with us, just as He always did. He is here just the same as--as He ever was. [Revelation 1:18]

L-16 Now, they, the reason (they) why didn't they believe it, is because the resurrection was too unusual. See, there was... That hadn't happened before, so it was an unusual thing for them to believe something like that. [Revelation 1:5]

L-17 And the unusualness is where God lays. See? Christ's birth was unusual, "a virgin shall conceive." God is always unusual. He does unusual thing, but it's always according to His Word. He never does nothing outside of His Word, so unusual; because, He promises it first, and then sends somebody to manifest that Word, to make It real to people. [Isaiah 7:14]

L-18 When you Pentecostal people first receive the baptism of the Holy Ghost, that was a unusual thing. But yet God promised It, "pour It out in the last days," and here It was. So no matter how unusual it was, it was a promise of God that had to be made manifest, 'cause God promised it. [Acts 2:17]

L-19 Now the resurrection was unusual to many of His, the people that loved Him; yet it was a promised Word, but too unusual to believe. [Luke 24:1-12]

L-20 Divine healing today, is--is so unusual to people till they don't want to believe it, and yet it's the promised Word.

L-21 This thing that we're seeing taking place today is a promise of God, but it's so unusual to the mind who has never thought of it in that way.

L-22 And that's the way the resurrection was to many people who loved Him. There were people who honored Him and believed Him to be a prophet of God, and believed Him to be the Son of God, and so forth, but still (they, they) the--the resurrection was too much for them to believe. It was too phenomena. [John 3:13]

L-23 And you take anything that's really way out in the phenomena like that, always check it with the Word. And if the Word promised it, then it's only God rising on the scene again. And that's the way every promise is.

L-24 And that's the way they should have seen it then, 'cause God promised He would raise Him up the third day. David said, "I will not leave His soul in hell, neither will I suffer My Holy One to see corruption." Jesus said, "Destroy this body and I'll raise it up again in three days." See, it was a promise. [John 2:19]

L-25 And it was a phenomena, very unusual, and many who loved Him could not understand it. Because, it was--it was staggering, to the whole world, for a Man who had been crucified, and a sword run through His heart, or a spear, every drop of blood in His body had dwindled out upon the cross, and had took Him and sealed Him in a tomb, and rolled a rock over it, it taken a century of man to handle it, and then seal it with a Roman seal, and then to say, "An Angel come down and broke the seal, and rolled away the rock, and here He is alive among us." It was kind of a strange thing. [Luke 24:1-12]

L-26 And today it's the same kind of phenomena. When people thinks He died, that settled it, nineteen hundred years ago; and here He is today, after nineteen hundred years, still among us, just as much as He was then, just as real as He was then, doing the same things He did then. It's too much of a phenomena. The people can't understand it. It goes beyond their reasoning. Certainly, who can reason God? No one can reason God. [Revelation 1:18]

L-27 No one can interpret God. God is His Own interpreter. God speaks the Word; and they say, "Well, you got the wrong interpretation." God makes it come to pass, that's the interpretation. Don't need anybody to interpret Him. I just spoke on that, a city below here. God said, "Let there be light," and there was light. It don't need any interpretation; there was light. God said, "A virgin shall conceive," she did. That settles it. So when He speaks anything, and then He--He is His Own interpreter. He doesn't need our interpretation of it. The Bible said that, "The Scripture is of no private interpretation." It's God Himself doing the interpretation of It. Notice, many didn't see it because they hadn't searched the Scriptures. They hadn't listened to what He said. [Isaiah 7:14], [Genesis 1:3], [II Peter 1:20]

L-28 Many, today, hasn't listened to the Message, hasn't listened to the Scripture and what Christ promised in these last days. That's the reason that people are in the condition they are today, and the churches are all gummed up among one another. They haven't noticed what the Scripture said for this day. They didn't notice these things had to be done. It's 64-0212, When Their Eyes Were Opened, They Knew Him, Elliott Auditorium, Tulare, CA, 78 min just the fulfilling of the Scripture. Many people love Him. Many people believe in Him. But yet it's too phenomena, they can't understand It, when you talk about Him, to being just the same as He was yesterday, doing the same things. They claim they believe that, but, when it takes place, then they don't understand it. They, they just can't believe it. [Hebrews 13:8]

L-29 Notice, they were talking of Him when He appeared. Now, that's a good thing. We notice here in the Scripture, It said, "And while they talked of Him, while they spoke of these things, going along, talking about Him, sad," when they find out that He appeared. And when He appeared, He appeared unto them while they were going along, reasoning about Him. That's when He always appears, is when we talk about Him. Always, through the Scripture, it's when the people talk about God, that's when He appeared. [Luke 24:13-51]

L-30 Now we're too busy talking about other things. I think that's the reason many people, who love Him, fail to see Him. We're so busy with our creeds and denominations, and business about the churches, and memberships, and getting more members and things, we're too busy to talk about Him. He's the Word. We're too interested in what the... some creed, some textbook, or something else says. "How many members can we get in, vote them in? Shall we take this one, that one, the other one?" We should be constantly giving ourselves to the Word of God and prayer, studying the Word. But we're too interested in something else.

L-31 These people were sad. They were talking; a great thing had happened; He would been taken away. But they were talking about Him, and there He appeared. And when He appeared, He was a stranger to them. They didn't understand it. First, He re-... first, we find out that He was walk-...

L-32 As they walking on the road down to the little city, Emmaus, just a few mile or two down there, Sabbath-day's journey, or something; the first, He revealed the promised Scripture of Himself, to them, for that day. Now notice when Jesus comes on the scene, if we want to see Him and talk with Him after His resurrection, like they did, like they saw Him, the first thing He did to them was reveal Himself to them, by the Scripture. Amen. That's to make it what? They were Hebrews. They believed the Word. And they... He, He revealed Himself, revealed the written Word of Himself, what He was supposed to do for that age. Amen. Each... [Luke 24:13-51]

L-33 God, in Genesis, and then before the foundation of the world, He lotted it, and He spoke it and said what would take place, down from the beginning--beginning to the end.

L-34 Always the churches gets that all scrupled up, and they get out, and man has to inject what they believe about It. And this one says, "Well, I believe a little different from that," and he makes him something. And this one has got to do something. Each one has got a tower, city, or something that they got to build, always trying to add something or do something, and say that, "We did this." Oh, that's the way you get confused.

L-35 Get out of the picture. Let God do it. See? Here is His Word, what He said He would do. Each age, He sends a prophet on there, with anointed. The Word of the Lord comes to the prophet, always, to vindicate It in the age.

L-36 John the Baptist came on the scene. He was the prophet for that time. He was the Light of the age, 'cause the prophet, Malachi, had spoke of him coming, "I'll send My messenger before My face." Isaiah, seven hundred and twelve years before that, said, "A voice of one will cry in the wilderness, behold I..." what he would do in the last days, "make straight the path in the wilderness," and all these things was prophesied of him. When he come on the scene, he was the prophet to manifest that promise. [Malachi 3:1], [Isaiah 40:3]

L-37 Jesus is the Word, and the Word always comes to the prophet. And remember, when this prophet was prophesying, "making straight the path," and then when the Word was on earth, the Word walked right out into the water and come to the prophet. Amen! How perfect! The Word comes to the prophet. And He was the Word. For, "In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God. And--and the Word was made flesh and dwelt among us, and we beheld Him." No wonder He said, "It's behooving to us that we fulfill all righteousness." The Word came to the prophet, in the water, to fulfill all righteousness. [John 1:1], [Matthew 3:15], [Amos 3:7]

L-38 And we find out then that He revealed Himself to Cleopas and his friend here. It's unknown, by name, the other party. But it was Cleopas, we know, and He revealed Himself to them, by the Scripture. Notice how He--He said. [Luke 64-0212, When Their Eyes Were Opened, They Knew Him, Elliott Auditorium, Tulare, CA, 78 min 24:13-51]

L-39 Notice, they, they called Him a "Prophet." "Know not these things? Jesus of Nazareth, a Prophet that God manifested Himself to." See? Which, before all the people, and so forth, He was called a Prophet. Then if they had recognized the One they were talking about, of being a Prophet, looked like they would a-seen right here that same Prophet picked up the Word again and begin to reveal It. [Luke 24:18-19]

L-40 Which, He was the Word, and was revealing Himself, by mouth, the Word that was written of Him. And He begin, and He started from Moses, and explained to them all that the prophets had said about Him. Oh, my! How He made it known for that age! "Fools, slow of heart. Knowing that Moses and all the prophets said that Christ must suffer and enter into His Glory." See, and for that age, that's what was supposed to take place. "Don't you know He is supposed to do that?" See, revealing the written Word of Him. [Luke 24:25-26]

L-41 That's the way Christ always does it. God never changes His program. The way He does it the first time, that's the way He does it every time. He made a decision, in the Garden of Eden, when man was lost, to save him by shed Blood. That's the only place He'd ever meet a man. That's the only place He's ever met a man, since. It's under the shed Blood.

L-42 We've tried to educate them. We've built towers. We've built cities. We've built everything else, trying to get people together. We've tried to take education and run them together. Try to take military power and run them together. We've tried denominations, to run them together. It's all failed.

L-43 God has got one place, that's under the Blood. That's the only way. Under the Blood, He'll meet man. And they're Blood-born brothers.

L-44 I hope I'm not blasting at you out there, with this, but it sounds like there is a rebound. If it is... Can you hear me all right? If you can, raise your hands. All right. Now, so just so I know that you're getting This; you must.

L-45 Notice now, when He said, still they failed to know Him by the written Word. Think of that! When He come and revealed Himself by the Word, to them, and they still failed to see it.

L-46 If that ain't a picture of today, I don't know what is. Still failing, when the Scripture says these things. "It shall come to pass in the last days," saith God, "I'll pour out My Spirit upon all flesh; your sons and daughters shall prophesy. Upon My handsmaids and maid servants will I pour out of My Spirit, in that day. I'll show wonders in the heavens above, and fire and smoke, and so forth." Still they don't see it. [Acts 2:17]

L-47 Jesus said, "As it was in the days of Noah, so shall it be in the coming of the Son of man; they'd be eating, drinking, marrying, given in marriage. As it was in the days of Lot, so shall it be in the coming of the Son of man." All these things they have spoke of, and the Word preached from the platform, and still many that love Him don't see it. They still grope on into darkness. Still they fail to know Him, by the written Word. [Matthew 24:38]

L-48 They take seminaries, and go off and misconstrue It, and everything, and bring it back, and they don't know what in the world to--to believe. One says It's this way, and one says It's that way. So just the written Word, Jesus never told them to go into all the world and "teach." He said, "Go into all the world and preach the Gospel." A lot of difference, try to teaching something, and preaching something. Preach is to "make manifested." It'd have to do it, demonstrate the power of the Holy Ghost. "These signs shall follow them that believe." Takes the Holy Ghost to manifest that Word. If it's the Truth, Word, God will manifest it. If it isn't Truth, God won't have nothing to do with it, 'cause God won't entangle Himself with lies, you know that, because He is God now, same now. [Mark 16:15-17]

L-49 They claimed that they had believed, and they were His disciples, they loved Him, they believed it, and He was standing right with them, interpreting the Word, Who He was, and still they didn't know it. Just think of that! They didn't know it, and Him standing there Himself, written in the Scripture, and goes back and picks up the Scripture, been written for hundreds of years, concerning Him, and telling how He must do and all these things like that, and walk around and say, "You don't say so? Well, what do you know!" And Him, Him doing the talking, and they still didn't recognize it. [Luke 24:13-51]

L-50 What a picture of this day! Same now, they claim they believe that He had raised from the dead, but, when He 64-0212, When Their Eyes Were Opened, They Knew Him, Elliott Auditorium, Tulare, CA, 78 min appears to show Himself, they still don't believe it. See? Yet, they claim they believe It. "Oh, yes, we believe He rose the third day." Let Him do something to show He raised the third day; "Oh, I don't believe in that." See? There you are, the same thing.

L-51 Notice, He said, "Fools, and slow of heart to understand the Scripture promise for this age." [Luke 24:25]

L-52 Fools said, "Oh, He is gone. They crucified Him, and we understood He rose again, but, oh, my, that's just a mystery story that somebody said. We didn't know nothing about it. Oh, I'm telling you, it's the most miserable thing!" [Luke 24:18-25]

L-53 He said, "You fools, and slow of heart to understand that what the Scripture has said for this age." Amen. [Luke 24:25]

L-54 There you are. I wish I could blast that to the Ecumenical Council. Yes, sir. Slow of heart, knowing the Scripture says these things; still don't understand it. There you are.

L-55 He said, "Fools, and slow of heart to understand the Scripture that's been prophesied for that day, and just exactly how it would happen, and here it's happened. Christ entered into His Glory, by suffering first, being dead; and died, rose again the third day. Didn't... That's the way the Scripture said he was to do it, raise up on the third day.'" He said, "This is the third day since it has happened." [Luke 24:25]

L-56 Said, "Well, that's what I'm trying to tell you!" And still they didn't understand it. Then He said, "You are fools, and slow at heart to understand all that the prophets has said, and the Scripture being said about this day And here it's happened right before you, and you don't know it." [Luke 24:25]

L-57 They said, "Well, what do you know!" See, their eyes were blind. You say, "Could it be blind in this day?" Yes, sir.

L-58 It's as blind this day as it was then. Right. Didn't the Bible say, "They'd be heady, high-minded, lovers of pleasure more than lovers of God; trucebreakers, false accusers, incontinent, and despisers of those that are good; having a form of godliness, but would deny the Power thereof, the Power of the resurrection and the manifestation of the Son of God"? The Bible said it would happen, so it's got to happen. Just as he said, Isaiah spoke and said, "You got eyes and can't see, and ears and can't hear." The same God said the same Scripture. [II Timothy 2:3-4], [Isaiah 6:10]

L-59 We notice, then, Paul, the great revelation that he had of Jesus Christ, Who He was, it was so great to know. Well, God put it in the Bible, that's how great it was. That's the reason he was given a thorn in the flesh, to keep him down so he wouldn't get big and exalted. God kept him down, and small, so He could use him in different parts of the country, do for Him what He wanted to, because he had the revelation of Jesus Christ, Who He was. [II Corinthians 12:7]

L-60 Then notice, here is the thing to do. Next thing we find out, they invited Him to come in. He got to the little place, the little inn where they were going to stay. It was towards evening, and they said, "Oh, come and abide with us." He made out like He was going on past. [Luke 24:28-30]

L-61 Oh, I thought that many times. He is only wanting you to invite Him. He made out like He would pass them on by. He might make out like He is going to pass you by, sister, in the wheel chair; or you, sir, in the cot; or you, out there with a heart trouble, that can't live but just a little while longer. These people are perhaps crippled, they might live an ordinary lifetime; but somebody out there with heart trouble, might die before morning, might die before tomorrow. He might act like He is going to pass you by, but He is only wanting you to invite Him in. See? [Luke 24:28-30]

L-62 You might think, "Well, He healed so-and-so, the other day. He, last month, I know, two years ago, I seen..." Yeah, He might act like He is going to pass you by, but He is only wanting you to--to invite Him. He makes out like He is going to pass. What He was then, He is today. What He does then, He does today. He said so. Notice, you must do the same thing, you've got to invite Him in. It was then, and only then, that He could reveal Himself. [Luke 24:28-30]

L-63 He couldn't do it by preaching them the Word. It went over top their head. Him walking on there, saying, "Well, you ought to a knowed there, you fools, slow of heart. The Bible said these things, that Christ must do these things, and so forth." Walking along there, well, look like they'd a-seen that's Who it was. He never come right out and told them, 64-0212, When Their Eyes Were Opened, They Knew Him, Elliott Auditorium, Tulare, CA, 78 min "I am He." You get a guy that does that, then you knowed there is nothing to Him, to begin with. But He just let the Holy Spirit reveal it. He told us. [Luke 24:25]

L-64 He told the Pharisee, said, "Search the Scriptures, in Them you think you have Eternal Life, and They are They that testify of Me. They tell you Who I am." They should know it. So ought they know, today, it's not a big bunch of racket, or a fuss, or a carry-on, or a lot of noise. It's Jesus Christ manifested among His people. Right. The Scripture says so. Notice, now, and that makes it true when God says so. [John 5:39]

L-65 We find now, the only way that He can reveal is to come into you. He is, He can, He is the Word. And the Word, in you, then the Holy Spirit reveals Christ, through the Word, after He gets in you. He is in you. You must take His Word. Say, "Well, my church don't believe That."

L-66 All right, you'll never get in. See? When you refuse the Word, you're refusing Him. "Well, my church believes in doing it This way."

L-67 But the Bible says do it this way. This is the way. Take it like it's written There. Not what somebody else has added to It, but what God said about it. And then He could reveal it to you, but He's got to get into you, first. Then, and only, can He reveal it.

L-68 Don't stand and look at It and try to figure It out, like the Pharisee said. They stood and looked at Him there, said, "This man is Beelzebub." They couldn't figure it out. They had to give it a name. They said, "This man does this by the spirit of the devil. He, He is a Beelzebub, a fortune-teller. Why, don't have nothing to do with this Fellow. He was born in sin. He don't have our fellowship cards. He doesn't belong to us. And, oh, my, they... We don't even know where He went to school at. He has no education. Why, well, where did this Man come from? Now He says, 'The Son of man that's going to ascend up, descended down'? He was born right here. He is crazy. 'Unless you eat the flesh of the Son of man, drink His Blood'? He is a cannibal." And He did that just to make them say those things. They had to do it. [Matthew 12:24], [John 6:53]

L-69 And so is the Holy Ghost, today, putting forth His Word, in manifestation, that men might condemn it, that God might put His judgment upon the earth, as He promised He would do. He hardened the heart of Pharaoh. Hallelujah! He is the same yesterday, today, and forever. He changes not. He is God. His systems of doing things, shows Himself mighty with His Word, to manifest It. He don't have to tell you all about it. You don't have to figure it out. You can't figure out God. You got to accept It. Just invite Him in and see what happens. [Exodus 14:8], [Hebrews 13:8], [Exodus 10:1], [Exodus 9:34-35], [Exodus 7:14], [Exodus 4:21]

L-70 Now, we notice again how He made Himself known to them, after He got in. How did He do it? He opened their eyes to who He was. When He got into them, then He opened their eyes, to see. [Luke 24:31]

L-71 Now when the Word comes into you, when you accept God's Word and It comes into you, then the promise (of that promise that you've accepted) manifests itself, and then you know Who it is.

L-72 By what did He do, how did He make Hisself known to them? Because He did the same things that He did before His crucifixion. Then they knowed that that was Him, because He had raised from the dead. All the preaching, all the teaching, and everything else He had done, had failed. But when He revealed Himself, doing the same thing He did before His crucifixion, they knew it was Him. It opened their eyes. [Luke 24:31]

L-73 Brother, sister, He is the same yesterday, today, and forever. He changes not. Just as He did the woman at the well, see, He never changes His program. [Hebrews 13:8], [John 4:5-29]

L-74 Now, this little woman at the well, she knew the Scripture promise for that day. Notice when He come to the little woman at the well. He said, at Sychar, He said, "Woman, bring Me a drink." [John 4:7]

L-75 She said, "Why, it's not customary for you Jews to ask us Samaritans such as that." [John 4:9]

L-76 He said, "But if you knew Who you were speaking to, You would ask Me for a drink." [John 4:10]

L-77 Well, then she thought, "Some smartaleck, so I'll just question Him a little bit." She said, went to question Him. 64-0212, When Their Eyes Were Opened, They Knew Him, Elliott Auditorium, Tulare, CA, 78 min Directly He said, "Go get your husband and come here." She said, "I don't have a husband." [John 4:16-17]

L-78 Said, "That's right. You've had five, and the one you're living with now is not your husband." , [John 4:17-18]

L-79 Watch! Quickly, what did it do? It got in. Quickly, she knowed something. Said, "Sir, I perceive that You are a prophet." Amen. See, there was a seed laying there, to come to Life. There was a switch there that would turn on Light. To them Pharisees, it was darkness, to begin with; no switch, no batteries, no nothing else. But to this Man; this woman, little prostitute, she said, "Sir!" [John 4:19]

L-80 Why? She was looking for the manifestation of the Word. Four hundred years since Malachi, they had had no prophets, and here was a Man that manifested to be a prophet. Quickly she knowed that was something. She said, "Sir, I perceive that You are a prophet." She said, "We know that when the Messiah cometh, that's going to be what He does." [John 4:19, 25]

L-81 He said, "I am He that speaks to you." Now He can reveal Himself. She has already received Him. He is on the inside now, see, He can make Himself known. That's how He made Himself known to the world, woman. Why? She believed the promised Word, and when she seen the promised Word manifested. [John 4:26]

L-82 Now we know, in Deuteronomy 18th chapter, 15th verse, Moses said, "The Lord Your God shall raise up a Prophet likened unto me." And she knew that that Messiah was going to be a prophet. And the last prophet had ceased, many, many years before that. There had been no prophets. And here stood One. What was it? It was the next thing in line. That was the Word. What did He do? He revealed it to her, by telling her, revealing that He was that prophet, by revealing her what she had done. Oh, my! [Deuteronomy 18:15]

L-83 That settled it. She left that water pot, and run into a city, and said, "You come, see a Man Who told me the things that I've done. Isn't this the very Messiah?" Stop her? Why, you couldn't do it; it was like trying to put a fire out on a windy day, and a dry house on fire. Yes, sir, it was burning and blazing. God had struck something home. She seen something. She knowed it was the Truth. The Word had been made manifest before her. Just exactly like it was to the disciples later on, see, when He was trying to show them the Word, and then manifested the Word. And here she knew the Word, and, when she seen It manifested, that did it.

L-84 One day, a man named Andrew had been watching John, listening to him speaking of a coming Messiah. Peter was his brother; wasn't interested. They had a godly old father that had taught them, "Now, son, we've trusted God for everything we need. Days when our bills couldn't be paid, we prayed, 'God, give us a catch of fishes today.' We'd go out, and God would give us that catch of fishes. And when we got that catch of fish, what would we do? We'd come in and give God praise for it, and sell our fishes. We've trusted God. I'm an old man now. I probably won't see the coming Messiah. But, watch. Before He comes, there will be a lot of false manifestation." [John 1:38-51]

L-85 And the Bible said there was. "False christs raised up." That's true. What was it doing? Trying to put out the light of that real One coming. See? We've had many cults, clans, and everything else rise up, and take you over to Canada and stick you in a shelter somewhere, up some other place, and lead a bunch off this way and that way, just exactly repeating itself again. What's it trying to do? What is it trying to do? He's trying to shut the Light of the Truth out. Now we notice.

L-86 Then one day, Peter came out on the banks, to do some fishing, and washing his nets. And Jesus came down. And the first thing we know, that, as soon as He come up in the sight of where Peter was...

L-87 He was well instructed, what that Messiah would do. His old father said to him, said, "Now, Simon, the Scripture says. You're, you remember, you're a Jew. The Lord has told us, 'If there be one among us, who is spiritual or a prophet, I the Lord will speak to him.' And if He, what He says is the Truth, manifested Truth, and what He says constantly comes to pass, then you know He has the Divine revelation of the Scripture. Now you'll know the Messiah when you see Him."

L-88 So he walked right up in the face of Jesus, one day. He thought, "I'd go see what Andrew was talking about." 64-0212, When Their Eyes Were Opened, They Knew Him, Elliott Auditorium, Tulare, CA, 78 min

L-89 And as soon as he got to Him; He said, "Your name is Simon, and you're the son of Jona." That settled it. That settled it, for he was taught in there that He would be a prophet. He knowed it. [John 1:42]

L-90 There was another little scholar had been teaching; when Philip was standing there watching that things go on. He took around the mountain, real quick, and got another man, by the name of Nathanael, who had been a Bible student, a studier. They had studied the Scriptures, 'cause they knowed the time was at hand. They were looking for Him to come. [John 1:45]

L-91 That's who He comes to, to those who are looking for Him. And we find out, today, He is not coming to those who is not looking for Him. There is no such a thing as Divine healing to--to those who don't believe in it. There is no such a thing as the baptism of the Holy Ghost to them who don't believe in It. It's just for those who believe it. That's right. That's all. So then we find out, those who are longing to know the Truth, God is obligated to reveal the Truth. He says His Word, then comes and fulfills It, gives His Own interpretation.

L-92 Now we find out, as soon as that little woman, she said... She couldn't understand how this Man was getting smart with her, she said, about giving her a drink, and she said, or bringing Him a drink, and trying to act smart. And the first thing you know, why, she got to talking to Him, and, come to find out, said, "We know the Messiah is coming, and, when He comes, He'll tell us these things."

L-93 He said, "I am He, that speaks to you." Then her eyes come open. Her eyes was opened. What about? The Scripture promise. Her eyes were opened by the Scripture promise.

L-94 Peter knew that his father told him that that Messiah would be a prophet. And here John had told, or Andrew had told him about a prophet, John, was down there prophesying, and so forth, telling something would happen. So one day he went down, after Jesus come. When he come into His Presence, He said, "Thou art Simon. You're the son of Jonas." What was it? His eyes was opened. He knew it. [John 1:42]

L-95 Philip and--and Nathanael had been studying the Scripture about Him coming. He come, said, "Come, see who I found, Jesus of Nazareth, the son of Joseph." "Oh," he said, "nothing good can come out of Nazareth." Said, "You come, see." [John 1:46]

L-96 And around the mountain they went. No doubt but what they rehearsed many things that Jesus had been doing, what He had said to Simon, what He had did, these things He had did.

L-97 As soon as Philip walked up into His Presence, with Nathanael, Jesus looked over to Nathanael, and said, "Behold an Israelite in whom there is no guile." He said, "Rabbi, when did You know me?" [John 1:46-49]

L-98 He said, "Before Philip called you, when you were under the tree, I saw you." His eyes come open. [John 1:47-49]

L-99 He said, "Thou art the Son of God; Thou art the King of Israel." What was it? He seen the promised Word of that day revealed.

L-100 Listen, brother, sister, the promised Word could be promised to you, and you can see it's the hour for that; but when God reveals it, interprets it, then it's sinful to turn It away. Don't you never do that. God opened his eyes, by showing him the manifested Word that He had promised that it would take place. Now, always does that the same way He does it, He never changes His system in doing it. No. So, remember, always the same. He promised the Scriptures for each and every age, and, when He manifests that Scripture promise for that age, the people who get their eyes open to see it are the one who receives it.

L-101 "Now, Brother Branham," you say, "it's getting late, now what are you going to say now."

L-102 What is the Scriptural promise for this age, so we can know what we're talking about? What are we here for tonight? What good does it do? Are we living near something? Do we really believe it? Have we testified in vain? Do we say we believe He is Coming? Do we believe His visible Presence? Do we believe that He is coming the Second time? Or, are we just making ourselves being fooled, or do we truly believe it? 64-0212, When Their Eyes Were Opened, They Knew Him, Elliott Auditorium, Tulare, CA, 78 min

L-103 Let's search the Scriptures then and see what's promised for this day, then we say, like the woman at the well, Philip and the rest of them, "We can see."

L-104 Remember, Hebrews 13:8 said, "Jesus Christ is the same yesterday, today, and forever." Is that right? [Congregation says, "Amen."--Ed.] He promised that. That's the Scripture. [Hebrews 13:8]

L-105 Saint John 14:12 said, "He that believeth on Me, the works that I do shall he do also." I'm backgrounding something. [John 14:12]

L-106 Now in Joel 2:28, and 2:28 and 30, and on down, He promised. He said, "What the palmerworm left, the caterpillar eat; and what the caterpillar left, the so-and-so eaten." Each one of those insects is the same insect; it changes its nature. The palmerworm is the caterpillar, and so forth. It's in different stages of its journey, and it's just eating and eating and eating, and it eat that tree of God right on down to a stump. Then will that tree ever live again? But, it was looked a hopeless case, but God said, "I will restore," saith the Lord, "all the years the caterpillars eat, the palmerworms. What they eat off, I'll bring it back in its power again." [Joel 2:28-30]

L-107 What the Lutherans left, the Methodists eaten; what the Methodists left, the Pentecostal eaten; what the Pentecostal left, so-and-so eaten; just on down, on down, on down; one with this, and one with this, and one with this, and one with this, and one with this, till it faded out into just a bunch of isms. We know that's the truth. I stand between you, and love you.

L-108 But, remember, in Malachi 4, not Malachi 3 now, Malachi 4, God promised to send the anointing again and "restore the Faith of the children back to the fathers again." And it's exactly what God promised, Joel. How will it be done? We find out that Jesus said, in Luke 17:26 to 30, He said it in the 27th... Luke 17, He said, "As it was in the days of Noah, they were eating, drinking, marrying, given in marriage; and knew it not till Noah entered in. So will it be in the coming of the Son of man." But He said, also, "As it was in the days of Lot." [Malachi 3:1], [Malachi 4:5-6], [Luke 17:26-30], [Joel 2:28-30]

L-109 Did you ever go back? I wish we had time to go back and just reveal that. Go back in Genesis, that's the same Book Jesus was reading. That's the One He was reveal, talking about. Go back there, look at this He said. And the sons of man... "The sons of God taken unto them the daughters of man." Women, the original translation in the Hebrew there says it was women. "Taken women," see, "unto them." [Genesis 6:2]

L-110 Just look today, look at the marry, and given in marriage, "and knew it not until."

L-111 Looky here, look at England, this great disgrace, look here in the United States, look at prostitution, look at everything. It's almost like the comedian said the other night, that, "Women has got their clothes so tight upon them, so immorally when they walk down the street; the next thing they'll be just have a spray job, they won't have to use clothes." It's just about the truth. Look at them how they go around, how immoral and dirty and filthy, they go. And you take, tell a joke, and set among the man, and something another like that, and said, "The only way you can tell... They dress like a man, and the man dress like a woman. You hardly... cut their hair the same, same. Only way you can tell one from the other; if you tell a dirty joke, a man will blush, women won't." Yeah.

L-112 "And then the daughters of Zion would walk haughty in the last days." They would fail to walk after the Lord. No matter what you say to them, you can just preach and preach and preach, it's just like hitting against that wall over there. It's a dense darkness upon them. There is no... seems to be so hard to find a genuine man that's man, and to find a woman that's really lady. [Lamentations 1:6]

L-113 Look upon the streets today, and upon our screens, and wherever it is, these uncensored program, cigarette smoking, cussing, carrying on, dressing like man, and things. Jesus said those things would be, and they're here. They don't need no revealing; they are already revealed.

L-114 Now watch, He said, "As it was in the days of Lot," look at the setting of Lot, God come down. And in two man went down into Sodom and preached down in Sodom. One Man sat up there with Abraham, the Elected Church, type of the pentecostal called out today, not in Sodom out there. [Genesis 18:1-2, 20-22], [Genesis 19:1-38] 64-0212, When Their Eyes Were Opened, They Knew Him, Elliott Auditorium, Tulare, CA, 78 min

L-115 Those who live among Pentecostals, and women who cut their hair, and man who carry on like that, and tell those dirty jokes, and carry on, they're not pentecostals, they're just carrying a name pentecostal. They're not pentecostals. Genuine pentecostal ladies are ladies. Genuine pentecostal man are man.

L-116 The schools almost having to close, for young 'verted boys being perverts and things like that, in the school, homosexuals all over everywhere. It's just a sickening sight! "As it was in the days of Sodom, so shall it be in the coming of the Son of man." [Luke 17:29-30]

L-117 Remember, notice right there, that 30th verse, "When the Son of man will be revealed." Did you ever notice that? Watch that 30th verse, "When the Son of man will be revealed, in the days like it was before Sodom." Watch what happened at Sodom. This Man stayed back. Two of them went on down, talked to--to Lot, to get him out of there, and he did--did no miracles down there, just smote them blind. But this out here done a miracle, before the Elect. He had His back turned to Sarah, and she was in the--the tent behind Him. Said, "Where is Sarah, thy wife?" Said, "She is in the tent, behind You." [Luke 17:30]

L-118 Remember, He called her "Sarah," called him "Abraham." Day before that, he was Abram; and she was Sarai, not Sarah. And notice, he said, "She is in the tent behind You." [Genesis 18:9-15]

L-119 He said, "I am going to visit you." What was it? God in flesh. "I'm going to visit you according to the promise." And Sarah laughed, and said, "These things can't be so."

L-120 He said, "Why did Sarah laugh, saying, 'These things can't be'?" Told her what she was doing. Him being the Word in human flesh, knowed the secrets of her heart, and said, "You did laugh!" [Genesis 18:1-15]

L-121 And when He was made flesh on earth, that's exactly what He done.

L-122 And what did He say? "When the Son of man is revealed in the last days, like it was in the days of Sodom." If Sodomites are all over the country, the whole world is messed and gone, and we see the church gone, then it's time that the Son of man reveals Himself: the same yesterday, today, and forever. That's the promise of God. [Luke 17:30]

L-123 Watch what He said. "A little while, and the world sees Me no more; yet ye shall see Me, for I will be with you, even in you. You will see Me; the believer." Same yesterday, today, and forever! Yes. "A little while, and the world sees Me no more." It can't see Him; their eyes are blind. [John 14:19]

L-124 But when you see the Son of man revealed, the Word come back in human flesh! A Man that eat the flesh of a calf, drink the milk from a cow, eat cakes that was made on a hearth, and was called "Elohim," amen, a Man with dusty clothes on, God manifested in flesh. There he was on earth, manifested in the flesh, and said, "As it was in the days of Sodom, when the Son of man is being revealed in the last days, the world would be in a Sodom condition," and here it is. Brother, sister, ladies and gentlemen, whatever you might be, this is the hour, and the interpretation belongs to God. May God open our blinded eyes to a Scripture promise, know that we're living in the last days. Amen! Let us bow our heads. [Luke 17:30]

L-125 Heavenly Father, so much could be said. That's enough. I'll stop. Lord God, Who made the promise, come on the scene, Lord, reveal it. Our flesh is no good, our flesh is weak, and it--it's poorly, Lord. It's not that there be anybody worthy. We're not worthy, Lord. But You promised it, and the hour is here. The Word stands before us. Walk down with us, Lord, tonight, and do something like You did it when You was back there on earth, two thousand years ago, that this church might know tonight that you live forevermore, that You're the same yesterday, today, and forever, and have promised the works that You did would be repeated again. "The Son of man would be revealed in the last days, as it was at Sodom." Lord, You never mentioned that (about Lot) about Noah. You never mentioned that You'd be revealed at Noah's time, but said, "As it was at Sodom, when the Son of man is revealed." Oh, can...

L-126 Lord, let Bible readers here tonight see the Truth. Let them see that Malachi 4, that this anointing is supposed to come, and to restore back again that Faith that the fathers once seen, the revelation of God in Christ. Now may they see the revelation of God in human beings, Christ manifested in the flesh of His Church, walking among us. Grant it, Lord. 64-0212, When Their Eyes Were Opened, They Knew Him, Elliott Auditorium, Tulare, CA, 78 min The promises You made, and the promises You will keep. And I commit myself, with the Word, with the church, with all, to You now, in Jesus Christ's Name.

L-127 With our heads bowed, would there be some here, before we have the prayer line, would say, "Brother Branham, I--I'm not a Christian. I--I--I--I want to be saved. Pray for me, will you, Brother Branham?" Just raise up your hand. "I'll do it." If you're just here, and not a Christian. God bless you, sir. God bless you, young man. God bless you, sir. That's good. Just... God bless you, lady. God bless you, lady. God bless you. That's right. God bless you, back there, sir. God bless you. That's good.

L-128 Someone else just raise your hand, say, "I'm not a Christian"? God bless you. I seen you back there, young man. God bless you, way back there. And way over here in the corner, yes, God bless you. "I'm not a Christian, Brother Branham, but I do believe that you're telling the Truth. I believe it's the Truth. I believe the promise says that. I have read, and I see that the promise promised that. I've never seen it, but I--I--I believe it." God bless you, young lady. Just another?

L-129 When you raise your arm, that does something to you. It certainly does. It gives you a feeling that you've done something that's right. There ain't a person put up their hands... I see you, way back in the back. Yes. There ain't a person that put up their hands but... God bless you. I see you there, again, and you here. Yes. My, that's good. Remember, if I miss seeing your hand, He'll see you. He knows all about it. Remember, He know. God bless you, young sister. He knows it.

L-130 Our Heavenly Father, they're Yours now. They couldn't have raised that hand; there is Something told them to do it. And yet, maybe, none of them has ever seen the visible outstanding signs of Your Presence here on earth in the last days, but they see it here, the Scripture said so, and may they understand tonight. That, even the Bible has been preached for all those years, and, still, people disbelieve. But when You got Cleopas and his friend, and then turned and did something just the way you did it when You were alive on earth before the crucifixion, they knew that was the same Jesus. Now, Lord, do the same for us tonight. Do, tonight, for these sick people, just like You did before Your crucifixion; then, after two thousand years, men and women will know that You live. We wait upon Thee, Father, through Jesus' Name. Amen.

L-131 Now to you that raised your hands, I want you to set real reverent for a few minutes. I'm going to call a prayer line. I don't say that God will do it. But I want to ask you a solemn question, people. As there is, oh, several hundred here, or five or six hundred, or whatever it is, look, that's--that's a whole lot of people. But, look, I want to ask you something. We are responsible to God. We are. And He is responsible for His Word. Now if He makes that Word live again, you--you--you--you... I want each one that raised your hand, and you that didn't raise your hand, immediately afterwards come here and stand at the altar, just as soon as we pray for the sick.

L-132 Where is Billy? Did... One, prayer card B, one to a hundred? All right. Let's, we're in a hurry, so we'll just start from number one. Prayer card B, number one, who has got it, raise up your hand. Look in your prayer card, see what it is. If you can't walk, why, some of you get down there so he... B, number one, two, three, four, five, stand up right here, if you will. One, two, three... If you can't walk, raise your hands, and they'll pack you. One, two... I only see one, so far. Would you come quickly, just as quick as you can, one, two, three, four, five.

L-133 If somebody would speak it in Spanish; I see there is many Spanish people. B, one, two, three, four, five. One, two, three... All right, there is three. One, two, three, four, there is another one. Number five, who has prayer card number five? Raise up your hand, somebody. How would you say it in Spanish? Is that prayer card number five, sir? [Someone says, in Spanish, "Cinco."--Ed.] Huh? ["Numero cinco, el numero cinco." "Here is five."] There it got it. Thank you. One, two, three, four... Then, well, which is missing? ["All there, five."] Is there five there? ["Yes."] Yeah, I see now. I didn't see him standing out there. All right.

L-134 Six, seven, eight, nine, ten. Say... [Blank.spot.on.tape. Someone says, in Spanish, "Seis, siete, ocho, nueve, diez."--Ed.] Now stand here just a minute. Six, seven, seven, eight, nine... That's it. Eleven, twelve, thirteen, fourteen, fifteen. ["Once, doce, trece, catorce, quince."] That's good. That's fine. Just a minute, let's call a few more. Seventeen, 64-0212, When Their Eyes Were Opened, They Knew Him, Elliott Auditorium, Tulare, CA, 78 min eighteen, nineteen, twenty. One to twenty. Start? One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine... thirteen, fourteen, fifteen, sixteen, seventeen, eighteen... That's it. All right, that's fine. That's good enough. Let's start with them. Thank you, brother.

L-135 How many here doesn't have a prayer card, raise your hand, and yet you're sick? Now remember, you don't have to be up here. You don't have to be here. Just believe.

L-136 Now let everyone be real reverent. I'm going to ask, in Jesus' Name, that nobody stirs for the next, about ten minutes, fifteen, anyhow, ten or fifteen minutes. Just let's--let's--let's give God that--that great respect. Everybody settle right down. Let's get real quiet now. Just a moment, and he'll have the line here. Now while he, they're waiting there, listen close to me now.

L-137 Now do you realize where I'm standing here? How many understands what I've preached about? See? And I've claimed that He has raised from the dead. Now He is raised from the dead, and promised to do this. Now it hasn't been in any years since the apostles, until this time, as far as we know, but He promised at this time, "The Son of man would be revealed like it was at Sodom." Now you read that in Luke 17, about 20 to 30, and see if that isn't right. He promised it.

L-138 Read Malachi 4. Don't mix it with Malachi 3, now. Malachi 3 was John the Baptist. See? But Malachi 4, as soon as this was over, the wick-... the righteous walk out over the wicked, and the world was burnt with fire, see. It never happened in the days of John's time. We're expecting that great anointing upon the Church, that will turn the hearts back to the original Doctrine of the fathers, back to the real genuine pentecost. [Malachi 3:1], [Malachi 4:5-6]

L-139 All right, be reverent. Billy, holler as soon as you get them all lined up, down there. All right, all ready? Okay. Now, real reverent. Somebody is going to help, walking alongside. Now everybody be real quiet, just a few minutes.

L-140 I want you to make me a promise. I promised God that I... And He knows my heart and He knows yours. Now, I'm only obligated to say this, what's Truth. That's all I'm obligated to do. God wrote It; I never. It ain't me, it isn't me; it's the Bible. You know it. Now if He will reveal that, won't that bring Him right here alive among us? [Congregation says, "Amen."--Ed.] See?

L-141 What if you didn't have the sense of sight, nobody did, and you would walk out into the sunshine. Sometimes you wouldn't know where you was walking, 'cause you was blind. And you walked in the sunshine, you feel real something around you, real warm, then after a while you'd walked into a shade, and you'd say, "It isn't there now." Nobody never knowed what sun was, never had that sense of sight, see, you wouldn't know what it was. Someone say, "That's the sunlight."

L-142 "What is sunlight? What is light, and what is the sun?" See, you never heard of it. See? "Well, it's a light that comes down." "What is a light?" See?

L-143 Now that's the way. We feel the Presence of God, then, and we don't feel It, then we walk in That. See? And you're in a--a dimension that you see. You can say what It is. See? You know what That is.

L-144 Now, if God is raised up from the dead and is here tonight, He promised it. Now His corporal body sets on the Throne of God; He took, set down on the Throne of God. But the Holy Spirit is here, which is Christ, in Spirit form. The word Christ means "the anointed One." And that anointing was upon Him, is upon the Church, we all. Now it's just kept coming, from justification, sanctification, baptism of the Holy Ghost, restoration of the gifts, right down, to the top of it. Right. It's coming in the minority all the time, is together now. And now there is a church, and now a Bride will come out of the church; see, church goes through the tribulation period, not Bride. Excuse me, I mustn't preach doctrine. Sorry. All right. This is the lady. Come here

L-145 Notice, I don't believe there is a person in here that I know, that I'm looking at. If every one of you here are strangers to me, raise up your hands, you know I know nothing about you; so that the people are strangers in here. 64-0212, When Their Eyes Were Opened, They Knew Him, Elliott Auditorium, Tulare, CA, 78 min

L-146 Now, please, please don't move around. Sit still, will you?

L-147 All that's in the prayer line, that doesn't know me, and know I don't know nothing about you, raise up your hands. There we are.

L-148 Now here sets a group of ministers. See, it's just right out here where we can all look, see.

L-149 Now this lady here is a stranger to me. (Now ever who is on that, the engineer, watch that mike.) All right, now I'm going to talk to her. Here, here comes back, Saint John 4, where Jesus talked to a woman and told her what her trouble was, and she believed that was the sign of the Messiah. If that was the sign of Messiah then, it's still the sign of Messiah, 'cause He's the same yesterday, today, and forever. Is that right? [Congregation says, "Amen."--Ed.] Met like this. [John 4:5-29]

L-150 Now, I'm not Jesus, and no doubt this woman here isn't that type of woman. But what I'm trying to say, it's the same; here's a man meets a woman, and then something wrong there, and if something will come in here to reveal it, that shows it has to be God. Now I wouldn't know, 'cause I--I never seen the woman in my life. See? And she raised up her hand that I didn't know her, and she don't know me, and here we just stand here.

L-151 Now I just want to talk to you a minute, after been speaking like that, preaching, sister. And if that's... So, you see, one is a preaching, another one is anointing, something else.

L-152 Now if the Lord Jesus could explain to me, or show me by a vision, something that you want, something that maybe it might be a sickness, it might be financial, it might be domestic, it might be for somebody else. I don't even know, see, don't have any idea. But if He would tell me something that's--that's wrong, or something is wrong in your life, or--or something, and it's you're terribly sick, or somebody else is sick, or something is wrong. If He would tell it, you would know whether it was the truth or not. You, you can say whether it's truth or not. Well, if He knows what has been, then He certainly knows what will be. If He can tell the past, He can tell the present and the future. Now would it make you believe with all your heart, that you would get what you're asking for?

L-153 Would it make the audience believe that they would get What this...?... [Congregation says, "Amen."--Ed.] Now don't move around now. I just a waiting and see, to see what He would tell me, 'cause I don't know. I just, meeting after meeting, getting nervous, you know, and preaching, and hurrying up, and watching this and what you've promised, and I should get you out of there at nine- thirty; it's nearly that time now; makes me nervous, so just have to quieten myself. See? It's a...

L-154 A gift is not something like you take a knife and chop something. That isn't a gift. A gift is to get yourself out of the way so the Holy Spirit can use you. And that's the only thing I have to do, is get William Branham from the scene, see, so God can come on.

L-155 Now, in the Name of Jesus Christ, I take every spirit in here under my control, for His glory, that the Words that I have preached might be manifested. He is here now. I--I wish I could tell you how it is. My, oh, my! If He would tell me that tomorrow morning to go to the Presidential graveyard and raise up George Washington, I'd tell you come watch it. Just what He would say now. See? I don't know what He would say, but, what He says, it'll be truth.

L-156 The lady is suffering with trouble with her eyes. She has got trouble with her eyes. It's bothering her. She's got back trouble that's bothering her. She is nervous, extremely nervous. Right. Isn't that right? If that's right, raise up your hand. Say, another thing, you are a minister of some sort, you're like a woman... You're a woman preacher. That's what it is. Now you believe with all your heart, go, and you can have what you've asked for. Do you believe it? [Congregation says, "Amen."--Ed.]

L-157 Come, sir. We are strangers to one another, I suppose. The Lord knows both of us. Do you believe that God can tell me? Now, that was a woman; here is a man. Do you believe that God can tell me what's your trouble? Would it cause you to believe? You suffer with a nervousness. You've also got trouble with your eyes; they're going dimmer all the time. It's been doing that for some time. Another thing, I see something over your arm. Oh, it's your high blood pressure. That's what it is, you got high blood pressure. That's right, isn't it? Well, raise up your hand if them things are 64-0212, When Their Eyes Were Opened, They Knew Him, Elliott Auditorium, Tulare, CA, 78 min right. [The brother says, "Thank You, Jesus! "--Ed.]

L-158 The more you'd talk to him, more it would be, see. Now watch, look, watch. Just take your hand down. We haven't got too many there; just take your hand down. Now, I don't know what I said to him, but it's on the record there, see, that's how it's on the tape. I don't know what He said.

L-159 But let's see now. Yes, it's eyes, that's for one thing. And then, another thing, you got a blood clot and that's on the brain, and you've had a stroke. That is true. Well, do you believe now? You believe you're going to be all right? Do you believe that that's God talking, not me? All right, then go, believe it. That's all you have to do, is just believe. If they could just believe, that's all. If they just believe, it's finished.

L-160 How do you do? Do you believe that God can reveal to me your trouble? [The sister says, "Yes, I do."--Ed.] And if He can, will it make you believe Him? ["Yes."] It would. What you scared about? Can't tell, can you? Like it's just darkness, nervousness. And then another thing, you've got trouble in your neck. ["Yes."] That's right. Your trouble is in your neck. Then you got somebody on your heart, that you're praying for. ["Yes."] You're having a lot of trouble with it. ["Yes."] And that's over alcohol. ["Yes."] It's your husband. ["Yes."] He's an alcoholic. ["Yes."] And you are praying for him. ["Yes."] You believe for him? ["Yes, I do."] Then I'll pray that Jesus Christ will do these things for you. All right.

L-161 Do you believe? [Congregation says, "Amen."--Ed.] Now that, practically, right... Those two, three, or what, four, whatever has went by, that's as much as Jesus did in the entire Bible. See? That's right. He done it to a woman, told that woman that one thing, and He went down to Sychar; He never said one more thing to anybody down there, but they believed because the woman's testimony. Yeah. That woman don't have to testify to you; you stand right here looking at it, yourself. You just must believe. Course, some wouldn't believe, there is nothing in them to believe with.

L-162 How do you do? Now, we're a strange. Wouldn't I be a terrible person standing here if... A lovely gray-headed woman like that, and think of things, and my own precious mother would have been about that age, and she just passed on here a couple years ago. And if anything I can do to help that poor lady, I'll do it. I know, if--if she is sick, if I could take and--and push a coin with my nose around this city, I'd do it. I don't care who would laugh at me. I--I want her to get well. If I could help her, I'd do so. But I can't help her. And much as He has done it, God had already did that. And He loves you more than I do. He died for you; and I never did that. But He loved you enough to die for you.

L-163 But then He sent me back just a little gift. He sent your pastor here to pray and lay hands on the sick, and, you see, that's been done so much in the revival, that that's kind of in the past, you know. And now it's up in some other, you know what I mean, a bracket, something else.

L-164 Now if the Lord will reveal to me what's your trouble, you believe me to be His prophet, or His servant? You believe it's Him? [The sister says, "Yes. I know it."--Ed.] You, you, well, I thank you, sister. ["Sure."] Now I believe that kidney trouble you've been suffering with will leave you. Do you believe that, too? You've got a request in your heart, you want to ask me. ["Yes."] What if I reveal that request before you ask me, would you, make you believe more? ["Sure."] You want me to pray for your daughter. She is not here. That's right. You want me to reveal what's her trouble? It's a real nervousness. Now you believe, and she'll get well. See? God bless you, sister. "If thou canst believe, all things are possible." See?

L-165 What does the Word of God... See if these ministers don't say this. The Bible said, in Hebrews, New Testament, 4th chapter, "The Word of God is sharper than a two-edged sword, cutting asunder, even to the marrow of the bone, and a discerner of the thoughts, intents of the heart." That right, brethren? [The ministers say, "Amen."--Ed.] See? [Hebrews 4:12]

L-166 What is it? It's the Word lotted for this day. The Word lotted for this day, fulfilling this promise, "When the Son of man shall be revealed, the days of Sodom, all these other things promised," here it is, it's the Word of God being revealed, 'cause it's the Word Itself discerning the thoughts that's in the heart. See? That's exactly right. [Luke 17:30]

L-167 Now, this lady, I know her not, another kind-looking person. What would I be, an awful person, if I could help and... 64-0212, When Their Eyes Were Opened, They Knew Him, Elliott Auditorium, Tulare, CA, 78 min

L-168 Now just a moment. Somebody else, it was a man, it was a man appeared, and somebody out there praying. Just have faith. I--I see now it's... I'll just have to say what I'm looking at. See, that's all I can say, is what--what I'm seeing.

L-169 You are, yes, you are suffering with a stomach condition. It's in your stomach. Then you want to ask me a request, and that's for your mother. She isn't here, but she is sick. You want me to pray for her. Isn't that right? You've got another request. It's for... It's somebody that's not here. It's a way away from here. And I see it's way... It's in another country. It's way away from here. And it's a--it's a young person, child suffering with some kind of a disease, tropical disease. South America, that's exactly. It's on you. That's exactly the truth. Right. But believe with all your heart now.

L-170 I don't heal. He has already healed. Can't you realize that's His Presence again? [Congregation says, "Amen."--Ed.]. I'll have to just keep going on and on, now it's begin to blind me a little, you see. You say, "That?"

L-171 Well, brother, sister! Jesus, a woman touched His garment, He turned around and seen what it was, and He said, "Virtue went from Me." Is that right? [Congregation says, "Amen!"--Ed.] Well, He was, that was God. What about me, a sinner? You must believe. Don't doubt. Believe. This is...

L-172 Do you believe? A young woman, and you believe that God can reveal to me what your trouble is? Well, would you, will you accept it and believe it with all your... You know it would be true. See? Now the one thing that's your trouble, is in your back, you have a back trouble. And then you have a great desire in your heart, for something, and, that is, you are seeking the baptism of the Holy Ghost. That's exactly right. Do you believe it? Well, you're going to receive It. Amen. Now go on and believe it with all your heart, and you'll receive the baptism.

L-173 Do you believe God can heal that arthritis and make you well? Now, just keep on walking and thanking Him. That's right, now. See? If you just will believe! All right, sir.

L-174 Would you come, lady, just as you was sitting there, please. Will you come? Do you believe with all your heart? [The sister says, "How can I doubt it?"--Ed.] Now that's the way, then you won't have arthritis. You won't be crippled with it. Just go on your road, and rejoicing. That lady's trouble stops, also. Just go, thanking the Lord, saying--saying, "Praise be to God!" All right. All right.

L-175 Now you believe setting there, lady, do you believe? All right, sir. Now that lady's trouble you've had, female trouble, for a long; just believe with all your heart, and go and it'll get... you'll get well, and won't have it no more, if you'll believe it. You have to believe it.

L-176 All right, bring the lady, the little girl. Come here, honey. Now, sis, here, I'll take her hand, just a minute. Come here, sweetheart. I thought that's what it was. Get choked up sometime, don't you, can't get your breath, hardly? That old asthma is awful bad, but God can heal it. Don't you believe that? Lord Jesus, I pray that You will heal the child...?...

L-177 Don't doubt, sister. It'll leave her. Go and believe now, with all your heart.

L-178 God heals diabetes. He can make anything well He wants to. Don't you believe that? [The sister says, "Amen."--Ed.] Do you believe He'll heal you? ["Amen."] All right, say, "Thank You, Lord," and go right on, just rejoicing.

L-179 Just a minute. I keep seeing a man coming up here, I see. Here it is. Little fellow setting there, holding a little boy in his arms. Do you believe, sir? I'm a stranger to you. You believe God can reveal to me what you want? See, you touched Him. I don't know you. But you're suffering with a trouble, a bone disease. That is right. Your little boy there has got it. Your little boy setting next to him has got it. That's your little girl setting next to that. Her, is in her arms, and she is cross-eyed. If that's right, raise up your hand. Now do you believe? Don't doubt. Have faith in God. Just don't doubt. Just believe. All things are possible to them that believe.

L-180 What's you weeping for, little lady, sitting there, up on the end, with your handkerchief up to your face, crying? Do you believe me to be His servant? Do you believe God can reveal to me what your trouble is, from here? You got a spiritual problem you're studying about. Is that right? It's all going to clear up. It'll be all right. 64-0212, When Their Eyes Were Opened, They Knew Him, Elliott Auditorium, Tulare, CA, 78 min

L-181 That lady sitting next to you there, you just talked to her a minute. She just put her handkerchief up to her face. You believe God can tell me what's your trouble, sister? Will you believe me, as His prophet, His servant? You will? All right. That sinus trouble that's been bothering you, she'll go away from you if you'll believe it. Will you believe it? If you will, raise up your hand, say, "I believe it."

L-182 You want to eat your supper, from that stomach trouble, next to here, lady. You believe with all your heart, too?

L-183 The next lady has got a spiritual problem there. And you got a rash, too, that's bothering you. You got a daughter that's got a rash, also. Isn't that right? Yes, sir. She is set in. Do you believe that? All right, you can be healed if you believe it.

L-184 What about over this way? Here, see this little, Mexican man sitting down here on the end, looking right at me? Don't you see that Light hanging over him? The man is darkness above that, see, what it is there around him, that is epilepsy. Do you believe God can heal you of epilepsy, sir? You do? All right, He'll do it.

L-185 Say, the little man next to you there, little, Spanish man, he has a rupture. Do you believe God can heal your rupture, sir? Do you believe that with all your heart? You do?

L-186 Next, has got a stomach trouble. You that's nodding your head there, you have stomach trouble. Do you believe God healed you? Then go eat your supper, He'll do it.

L-187 Tell me what they are touching, all the way across the audience. What is it? It's the manifestation of the Word of God. Do you believe it, yourselves? Do you believe it? [Congregation rejoices--Ed.]

L-188 Where is some of them here? Here, here is a man laying on a cot. Sir, I don't know you. I've never seen you. Do you believe me? Do you believe what you've heard is the Truth? You believe it with all your heart? If--if God would tell me here what's wrong with you, will--will you... would you believe it? I'm going to tell you something now. And you know it, sitting by him. He is shadowed to death. It's cancer. It's cancer. And you're a minister of the Gospel. I see you standing in the pulpit. And that's right. And you're from out of town. Now you believe with all your heart. You believe with all your heart. Why do you lay there till you die? See? You can't lose.

L-189 There was some lepers. You remember the story, when Samaria was besieged, them lepers come in there? They said, "Why will we sit here till we die? If we sit here, we die; if we go in the city, we die."

L-190 The doctor has done all he can do. There can't nothing be done, is his answer in that. You only got one chance. Them lepers had once chance, if they went down to the house of the enemy; if they saved them, they lived; if they didn't, they was going to die, anyhow. But you're not asked to an enemy's house. You're in the Presence of your God. You're expecting to... Why don't you rise up, and take that cot and go home, in the Name of Jesus Christ. And believe it, and go home and believe you're healed.

L-191 Will the rest of you believe the same thing? If you do, stand up on your feet.

L-192 I'm asking those people who raised their hands, if they wanted to be saved, and wanted to accept Jesus Christ, I want you to come up here and stand here by me, just a minute. Will you come now? Come up here, you that believed and want to accept Christ. You'll never be any closer to Him till you meet Him visible. Remember, the Word, and I have preached, God has confirmed It to be the Truth. Come on, come up this way, every one of you. Everyone that didn't know Christ, that raised your hands, and come here; say you were sinners, and you wanted to be saved, come here and stand for a minute, for prayer. Will you do it? Will you come while He is so close? [Acts 2:37-39]

L-193 You mean you could see here the Word preached, see God turn around and say that Word is the Truth, "That's Me, that's Me, I'm standing here, the very God that's going to judge you," and then hold back? Don't do it, you might cut yourself off forever. See? Here is three of them standing here. There is about two dozen. Come right now, will you?

L-194 No, no song, you don't have to have a song. Christ is your song. Christ is your conviction. The Word is what tells it.

L-195 That's right, here comes two young man. Come right on out, you that's sinners. Come right down here just a moment, will you? Right while I just feel led, I stopped that prayer line for this purpose. Come right here now. Come 64-0212, When Their Eyes Were Opened, They Knew Him, Elliott Auditorium, Tulare, CA, 78 min right here. We'll get to the prayer line. Just... That's right. Yeah, ladies come right on in here, young things.

L-196 Right in this day when these young folks are coming, in this great hour when there is still teenagers on the rampage of immorality, these people are coming to... And I trust that God will make them such examples till, the neighborhood, where the people will see that Jesus Christ still saves the lost.

L-197 Won't you come? Come right out, where you're at. Move down here, just a moment. That's right. God bless you, boys. That's good. Come right up and stand. Come, come. Way back in the back, some people way back raised up your hands, won't you come on down now?

L-198 I'm almost persuading you. I'm... [Brother Branham begins knocking on the pulpit--Ed.] The Word is standing on the outside, knocking, trying to get in. "Lo, I stand at the door, and knock; if any man will open and come in, let Me come in, I'll sup with him, and he with Me." Won't you come? Come right down now, stand here. Look, the Word has been preached, It's been proven, Christ is raised from the dead, here He is doing just what He said He would do. Not connected with organizations, denominations, to take you into something; that's your choice. I want you to take Christ now. [Revelation 3:20]

L-199 Come, won't you? Is there another? Is... God bless you. That's right, bring him right on up here.

L-200 Brethren, will you walk down here? Now these will be members of your churches. Come down here.

L-201 Come on, somebody else. Right in the Presence of Christ, I can just feel the Spirit just calling in my heart. Surely, if that's doing that in my heart, there is somebody out there should be coming. Is there a backslider out there that should come? Come, stand here. Will you do it, some of you? Backslider, will you come? That's right. God bless you. Come on. That's it, come right on down. Certainly. That's the way. Be a real man; real lady. God made you, a lady. God made you, a man. That's virtue. That's strength. Come now, won't you? Come, stand around here. That's right. That's right. God wants you in His Divine Presence. Remember, the very...

L-202 Who is God going to judge the world by? Jesus Christ. Who is it promised to do this in the last days, to reveal Himself? Jesus Christ. It's not me. It's Christ. Christ is the One that's here revealing Himself. Humility, like He was; coming out of nothing, like He did; coming into us, like He has. He is God. [Romans 2:16]

L-203 Now each one of you ministers gather right down around these people, right quick now get right down among them here, stand right around them. We're going to pray for them.

L-204 Someone else wants to come in this prayer? Just a moment. All right.

L-205 These will be members of your churches, friends. This will be... You, you'll have to take them from here on, now. They see the Lord Jesus in His power of His resurrection. They are here to become members of your church. You baptize them in Christian baptism, take them into your fellowship. They are yours now, from here on. You're the caretaker at the inn.

L-206 Let us bow our heads, everyone. Each one, Christian out there, that's sincere, offer prayer for these people.

L-207 And if these ministers wants to take them into the room, where they can be instructed further, all right.

L-208 Heavenly Father, this is the results of the meeting. Here comes sinners, fifteen or twenty of them gathered around the altar, wanting to give their hearts to You. I pray, Father, that you will receive them, in the Name of Christ Jesus the Lord. I pray that You'll receive them, give them Eternal Life. They're Your heritage, Lord.

L-209 Each person in here, that's sick now, lay your hands on one another. Reach over, lay your hands, and start praying, one for the other. Lay your hands on one another, start praying, one for another.

L-210 Ministers, lay your hands upon these people here. That's it. There is power and glory and blessings upon us, and Satan is defeated in the Presence of Christ.
