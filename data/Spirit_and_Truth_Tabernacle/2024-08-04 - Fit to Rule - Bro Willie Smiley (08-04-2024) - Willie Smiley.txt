that's what I got amen we definitely got to keep praying that we we get that new church cuz uh I'm weary of this little bit of pool pit if nothing else I can't fit all of my stuff up here amen uh let's see y'all give me give me one second I don't know if I done crossed up my scripture and that I told Brother Troy I was studying um all week and I changed my thought last night okay well let's let's start at the first verse of 1 Samuel chapter 16 and the Lord and the Lord said unto Samuel how long will thou mourn for Saul seeing that I have rejected him uh reigning over Israel fill thy thine horn with oil and gold I will send thee to Jesse the bethlehemite for I have uh provided me a king amongst his sons and Samuel said how can I go if if Saul hear it he will kill me and the Lord said take a heer and uh with thee and say I come to sacrifice to the Lord and call Jesse to the sacrifice and I will show thee what Thou shalt do and thou shalt anoint me anoint unto me him whom uh I name unto thee let us maybe skip down to like the 11 verse in in uh Samuel said unto Jesse I hear all thy children and he said there remaineth yet uh the youngest and behold he keepeth the sheep and uh Samuel said unto Jesse send and fetch him for we would not sit down till uh he come hither and he sent and brought him in now he was uh Ruddy and with all and of a beautiful countenance and and goodly to to look to and the Lord said arise anoint him for this is is he then Samuel took the Horn of oil and anointed him in the midst of his Brethren and the spirit of the Lord Came Upon David from that day forward so uh Samuel uh rose up and went to Rama let's just bow heads for a word of prayer and if they could pull up Romans chapter 8 uh verse 17 and 18 for me gracious father we just come this morning to give thanks and praise for just allowing us this opportunity to be able to come into fellowship and to just try to share something that will just strengthen us oh God for the journey that we're on Lord we just appreciate you we ask that you would bless the pastor and his family Lord God um as they um journey and travel and enjoy Lord and we just pray that father God um that you just watch over them and keep them we ask that you just anoint me this morning give me a touch in in in the body Lord I'm kind of feeling a little achy this morning but Lord we reporting for Duty and as the service go go on May you just give me a a mighty touch we thank you for all things in Jesus name amen amen you may be seated this morning okay just another little scripture I like to read Romans uh 8:17 and 18 it says and if children then heirs uh Hees of God and join HS with Christ if if so be that we suffer with him that we may be also glorified together for we reckon that the suffering of this present time are not worthy to be compared with the glory which shall be revealed in US amen may the Lord add a blessing to the reading of his word this morning uh we we just like to uh use as a little topic this morning like we say I I kind of changed I had something for two weeks in my mind but uh I just felt of the Lord to change we want to talk this morning on fit to Ru rule fit to rule um when when we look at this little passage of scripture it it it really shows us something um uh you know the prophet makes a statement and I got it in the quote he said you know God is featured in character right and one of the things we find uh uh the spirit of God left Saul because uh Saul kind of got himself away from uh the word of God and the the the mandates that was set by God is that right and so you know um uh man man and our understanding we have our Concepts and precepts about what a what a a a leader should be or man of God should be and God has his uh understanding his thoughts about you know what what a servant of God should be is that right sir amen and uh we we we we just like have to keep in the order of scriptures one thing we we we got to be able to follow God through the scripture and we find God always identified by its characteristics right and and outside of that um uh you won't see God identified in it is that right uh because if if it's if that's the case it it starts to break the patterns of the scriptures is that right and God always wants to re remain in in scripture so so you know what what we find here is that um uh God God had his man that he wanted to bring on the scene to to express him right Express a character right but you know uh he he was he was chosen and anointed by God is that right he was he was given a a a uh a a mandate from God that he would he would uh be in this position he would be in this place is that right but one of the things that that you know in in studying uh scripture and just looking at life also um there something that goes go along with being placed in a position of of authority is that right and and and and one of those things is is is responsibility sir right sir and weight I'mma say that again one of the things that goes along with uh being in a position of of leadership right no matter no matter what it is whether it's it's on a job whether it's in the church whether it's in the home uh and I wish I would have learned this early on right if I could have if I could have understood these these these principles of of the scriptures from a youth up right I I want to I want to stop just a minute and and share something with we we got a lot of young men and we got a lot of young sisters and and even some of us older we we're not too old to to learn because I I've still been in a season of learning yes sir Amen in a in a season of of of understanding responsibility in the weight of the responsibility that that uh I supposed to Bear right being in a position of leadership right um we we we find that you know God had called him and anointed him but one of the things that that David did not comprehend was the process right how many people have ever been been promoted to a a position on the jobs there's there's a a a steps there's a process that that you have to go through or or if you're Desiring a a higher level of positioning that there's there's steps there's a process to get you to this place right so so you know uh God is Sovereign right and I realize that more and more as I as I I grow and I mature and I age I realize the the sovereignty of God and and how how God has you know even way back in things that I did not understand as as a young man and at 62 I'm I'm still kind of learning you know instead in the scripture what we find U was was you know David had to go through a process he was he was called and he was anointed for the position right but it took about a 20 years span according to history for him to actually amen obtain came to this position of of of King is that right but but through through 20 years uh um he was he was going through a process that you know what he probably didn't even amen grasp initially because you know in in reading the whole story of of of uh Saul and and David you know we we we we like to tell about the story of how David uh uh killed Goliath and and that just kind of started things for him right and then you know he he he ran the Philistines and he came back and and you know the sisters was all happy and and they were singing Saul his thousands and David his 10, thousands right and and from that point now David not realizing uh uh uh that he was going to go through this this process right before he could obtain amen this position in place because I want to say something amen the these things the the process is is about experience right yes sir and giving Insight right right right let me say that again ahead the process is about experience and and getting Insight so when you get to this position you'll have something when you get there yes sir amen amen right I'm going say that again Lord so when you get there you'll have something when you get there there's a lot of people that that that want to want want positions you know young men want wives and things of that nature uhhuh but you know what amen when they get there they don't have anything amen because they don't a lot of times have any experiences is that right and and there's a lot that goes uh uh into these positions responsibility and weight amen yes sir right and and so it's the process is beneficial right even when you don't think it the pro whatever you going through this morning is beneficial cuz even in in the readings here in second 1 Samuel if you go through and you read the whole uh story of of the interaction of of David and Saul um there's times where even David question Jonathan like man I can't comprehend why is it why is it that he feel the way that he feel about me why why is and we all have been there why is this happening to me right right right yes sir it's it's because it's it's it's necessary it's it's needed for our benefit for when when we when we get to this position in place we'll have something when we get there is that right come on Church yeah amen it's it's it's so the process right is essential you know and looking at the scriptures this morning I I saw saw in the scriptures something that you know I didn't see through time it it it was what God allowed because God gave him the commission yes sir God placed the anointing upon him right sir and God allowed him to go through through this process to build character amen sir amen right to to build a character because uh Power without character is satanic yes it is all right and and it's impossible to rule apart from the character amen sir is that right we all can say Amen to that we all we've all dealt with bosses who didn't have character abuse of of authority is that right oh glory to God people that that that you know was placed in positions but when it comes down to uh uh the character and fully understanding all of the responsibility and the weight of the position and all of those different things somewhere they miss some classes y'all ought to talk to me can I get one person that'll preach with me this morning huh it's it's it's some and you know it's so unfortunate it's so unfortunate uh in in society today that uh uh it's a lot of classes being missed it's it's a lot of things that that's not being comprehended now I can preach to myself because you know as a Christian since 1988 it's like sometimes I look back and like where was I when they were giving out that lesson that class maybe you know you know like some folk they sleep in class y'all don't to talk to me I know what I'm talking about boy I was in high school boy look here it be some of the mornings my head be down boy I be out of it but it was it was things that I needed while I was sleeping yes sir I said I said something yes you did see it's it's things that are needed while we're sleeping while while we're sleeping through the through the the process is that right and so Saul Saul gets go Saul and and see here's the thing God allowed Saul to get in this position right to help mold a character uh uh in David to ex to express to his his his future congregants or his his men what what true uh uh character entails and it and something that that that you know um I was looking at and and reading in 1 Samuel 16 on on out it was a word that was used and you know we we know uh uh uh David learned how to duck uh javelins right and and one of the things that the scripture say through all of those things just to kind of paraphrase now y'all go back and and and read in there and you it says he he kind of moved wisely he he he moved it it means he moved in in humility right and and let me tell you something that bother salt yes sir that that that affected that that put that now I'm saying something be because you know you you got to learn how to overcome you got to learn how to navigate you got to learn how to operate yes sir when even when javelins right amen for seemingly no apparent reason right amen javins was was being uh thrown at David and and and if if if you you know you you you lack perspective you'll think it's not for anything right but but that's something amen that God is trying to get us to learn and understanding everything that we go through amen amen right amen everything has marit even even when we don't understand it like we were saying you know in Reading uh there was was a time where David was was uh uh talking to Jonathan and I said like man what why is your dad doing this to me Lord right he he had questions not really realizing you know it was it was God allowing him to to go through these things to benefit him yes sir and a lot of times you know and and I'm a living witness cuz there's been times where I you know I've sat in my room or been driving in my car and and and you know questioning God right questioning wh well why why did this happen and and you know y'all know how we get come on why did this happen and and you know you question yourself and you look at you know you you go back on your your your history and you you look at things and you like but I can't can't figure but but God knows that what you going through if not now somewhere down the line You'll benefit from it yes sir or somebody will benefit from your experiences sir cuz you can't teach what you ain't got right amen you can't talk about what you ain't got you can't talk about what you have not experienced right amen glory to God but when you go through some things see David could talk about amen how to uh Dodge and and and get out of way of danger right amen amen not from an intellectual stem but because of experience yes sir right sir you know he probably say man you got to move your body like this and you got to you know what I'm saying come on you know you become a Craftsman at at dodging right oh glory to God now I just said something but I know you missed it sometimes you got to you got to be crafty at at at dodging right cuz cuz people people uh try to be subtle and crafty in the way that they they throw things out there y'all ought to preach with me I feel I'm starting to feel good come on the cuz the natural types the spiritual exactly right and so it's it's through our experience we we learn how to to to dodge things and and and express amen a a a form of humility that brings fear to the enemy yes sir like the say this just ain't no ordinary person here hallu this this just ain't no ordinary brother this ain't no ordinary sister that I'm dealing with be because if if I would have throw this at you know certain folks it might have been different the attitude might have been different right but we're dealing with a man after God's Own Heart Hallelujah that's powerful Church see we got to recognize something you know we're just not anybody right we're we're we're we're we're people after God's Own Heart we're we're we're the chosen we're we're the elected by God we anointed amen of God is that right to be in the position come on that we're in and a lot of times amen people can't comprehend that oh they think they this and all they all stuck up and you know it's it's like you know you can't help being God's chosen true well praise the Lord you can you you can't help that God predestinated you before the foundation of the world right right you can't help that God saw in you something is that right yes sir and pred see you're you're not just here Amen on your own accord you're here because God pred destinated you before the foundation of the world to be here yes sir but also in being here there's a responsibility right yes sir there's a responsibility that's been given I think one of the preachers was talking about uh uh in the last few weeks uh uh a gospel of reconciliation yes sir right yes sir see that there there's a whole lot that that that goes along with with with with being a people of God right that that really warrants Insight on our behalf glory to God it it really does it warrants amen Insight am see you know cuz cuz you see you'll see a lot of carnality right but one of the things the prophet makes a statement he say we pay for neglect wow I'm G to say that one again that felt good we we pay for we pay for younger generation you pay for neglect come on see one of one of the things that that Solomon Solomon taught his his his sons was to uh in getting get understanding that's right right never put yourself in in such a place where where you you refuse uh real Godly spiritual Insight something that'll help you navigate right something that'll help you you you you navigate amen your future yes sir amen young men you know you know I I I've been there I ain't you know we we we all can some of us can talk about it we ain't all been saved all some of us haven't been and and it's it's nothing it's nothing that you know we trying to talk about and brag about and things of that nature but we we did things because we we we lack knowledge sir because you know giv understanding we we probably wouldn't do the things that we did right given given given understanding you know uh we we wouldn't have took folks into our bosoms and may uh May imprints y'all ought to preach with me somebody this this young men and young women it's it's people that you you wouldn't gravitate towards be because of of the lasting effect that's right right amen and and a lot of times we do this and the the outcome of those things aren't good and then those things affect your future right in in Insight you'll benefit from it come on Amen down the line if if if you're if you've been Quicken you you you'll gain a knowledge that will be needed sir to navigate amen your future yes sir Oh Glory to God this kind of a com service you know cuz sometimes sometimes you know um our Young Generation uh needs the benefit of our matured experience and and where where where would these young men get this knowledge and insight that's that's based upon biblical principle not conal knowledge unless they getting it from us they get getting it they getting it from Godly fathers and Godly mothers and and godly Ministries right that's giving us that's giving us Insight right amen uh to things that'll help us Amen in our future to help us when we're in courtship right all right yes sir huh that that'll help us once we actually jump the broom that that you don't you don't go into these things like we went into these things amen uh uh with a lack of knowledge right and and and you know one of the things that I look back on and and it's like you know it's hard for me to repent of things that I just didn't understand knowledge come on church people want to hold you to to to certain things but it's like how could you hold a person to something that they they didn't know was important right and and this is this is why sometimes I think we we really we really need to deal with a uh more of a reality sometimes with with our generation really get down and and express things in a Godly manner uh that'll help them is that right so that they they don't go into things and approach things naive right amen right because because the wedding is not the marriage the courtship when everybody's got their best behavior going forward and the Honey around the moon and everything and you can't you can't get enough of that person and a few years down the line you can't hardly stand the sight of them huh oh glory and then you know you look back and you you wonder you wonder what happened what happened was you didn't have Insight you you you you wasn't groomed you wasn't groomed for for for the position because uh every young man I believe that notless you're a unic I believe that every every young man desires a wife right on is that right brother Mark is that right you ain't got that yet I put you under pressure then but it's okay you you'll get there you'll get there right amen amen but but you you want something that that that you've gleaned through life so that when you get there you can apply these principles amen that's right amen amen amen because there's principles that that that that goes along with this position in place is that right and you you got to be fit come on right you you as a as a young man you got to be fit to rule right we not talking about with a Iron Fist and a d mat that's not what we talking about right amen as as a as a as a mother you have got to be fit to rule to rule your your your your little you know Ministry yes sir glory to God but but a lot a lot of a lot of us we we've approached these things right naively and now we we feel the pressure but the pressure is good yes sir because what the pressure does what what the javelin throwing and all of these different things do it it it it helps you to grow and mature is that right it and and I I believe that you know what cuz if you if you go back in scripture you you look at uh uh Joseph right amen he had a dream right that he would be in a position of authority right right but look at look at the process look look at this process look look what he had to go through on his way to this position right despising your brother because your daddy like you and gave you a coat of many colors who do he think he is y'all ought to talk to me how many times have we experienced that amen right sir on the job in church yes sir Oh Glory who do they think they are Oh Glory to God especially especially you know a lot of times the pastor's family wo they scrutinized huh Welly y'all got cried I felt something did man just you know and everybody looking at your D side ways well they the pastor's family did not ask for that it was it was it was God's choice you know and and and you know here's here's the ironic thing that God chooses a man and and he gives the pastor's family a lot sir a lot of a lot of talent a lot of giftings is that right but on the same token right they're going to come under some scrutinies they're going to they're going to come under some stuff also where where they they going to have to benefit grow mature right cuz there's a lot of responsibility on pastor's children that there there that's weight sir that's weight on the deacon's children the song leaders cheering I don't know y'all know how forget side eyes and get the falling up they face and H you know but you you just you just don't know the the the responsibility and the pressure that goes along with it and and these are principles that even they you know like brother Solomon got his daughters you know and son and you know doing all and it's a real big responsibility that he has his wife has is can I use y'all as for a second it ain't going to be bad I'm I'm going to make it I'm going to make it real nice but but it is it's it's a lot of responsibility and it and it takes it takes for them having understanding of the responsibility and and the position and and what the position entails right now this this now y'all church I I'm not really an evangelist so I don't approach it like an evangelist so y'all for give me this morning right I'm not your pastor but I'm just one of the assistants so with a little bit more experience than the maybe the younger fellas this what comes with being 62 hallu huh amen cuz cuz because you know when you when you're young when when you're young and you're 20 you know you you you got you got the answer to all the questions even before you know what the questions are how many times your children told you I know you know what you the way that you're living and the things that you're doing shows me amen exactly what you know nothing nothing huh glory to God you ain't got no bank account you ain't got no money well praise the Lord huh but you you you know you a man and you a woman and and and really well why you here huh why you why you ain't on your own doing doing doing on folk stuff sipping on my water and iced tea and sucking up my air conditioner and crying about $200 a [Music] month huh when all my check go into bills and you sitting up here slide running down your mou and everything you in here chilling no stress no real pressure no nothing cuz you feel like Daddy got me Mama them got me right and you grown until everything Your World falls apart huh then you become prodal just just you know no no longer call me a son I'll just be a servant now psych ology Psychology 101 see if if if if you were if you were built right if you went through the the weatherbe factory you'd have been built to handle depress yes right amen right amen but but but because you were something else bolted over and tried to make yourself a weatherbe you could not stand the pressure of the bullets so you exploded you exploded see you know um be being King being in a being in being in a position of authority you know you can't explode yes sir that's right right you know you you look at brother Jack and and all of that and you got to get away I wish some y' I feel you know I gotta stop a minute it make me want to break down it's it's it's things that that you you you Gana as you grow up you you learn to get away sir right amen absence make the heart grow fer where the pass that gone when he coming back when you see him right this thing don't revolve around one man it revolves about around the Holy Ghost right and sometimes it's so important to get away even as even as you know families and lay people just it's important to get away to take a breather to break the monotony right to help you carry to help you carry the the the weight that's right right amen cuz cuz just you know you you look at guys like you know um David and and and Moses and Joseph being ordained by God to be in a position of authority positions of of leadership and to think about and to think about you know what they went through on their way to this place in position yes sir right right you you if if you really look at it you can see where they benefited from their experiences their experiences didn't come to destroy them the the the B the the experiences came to strengthen them amen amen glory to God the experiences they came to strengthen right Amen to build strength resilience right is is the ability to recover from difficulties to bounce back with new insights and learning that's a word you you you ought to take home with you yes sir right be because Amen in these positions amen you got to be resilient right amen amen having the ability to back back the bounce back to recover do y'all can y'all imagine how many times that brother Jack has had to recover right

it's just things you know it's sometimes it's just little things you know uh little things you know I remember a time when we were happy right and then what happens children get in the way come on I'm preaching now how much time I got let me put my glasses on let me see how much time I got see he told me to change my sermon today cuz I think he wanted this preach this morning yes sir right and sometimes you you you got to take a a you know a trip down memory Lanes when you was the the happiest and a lot of times you know we were the happiest before children praise the lord it's okay parents to say yes amen praise the Lord your kids are understand because listen when when you didn't have no kids you didn't have the same responsibilities the the weight was different yes sir right it was just it was just you and him right are you and her however you want to say it you know y'all go to them fancy restaurants and all that you ain't had to worry about babysitters and this and you know Panthers and you know living you know where you could hard and make it and you know life living was a lot better for chilling but but children children was a part of the promise be fruitful and multiplied amen amen right come on that's that's a promise and blessings come along with uh uh uh Quivers yes sir you know yes sir I had a I had a heavy quiver six of them thank you Jesus they grown but it it let me tell you something and it was a responsibility don't play with it right when when when you got six children and your wife ain't walking Come on talk to me some of y'all sisters don't even know what that's all about right you had to work every day come on come on ain't nothing play with sir that might have been sub you could to did in the 50s especially now when we want all the amenities the big house the Fine Cars Birkin bags and nice clothes and Louie and and and the best cologne everybody got to work even the baby baby you got to get up out of here go get a job put you in a commercial or something huh cuz cuz it's it's difficult it's difficult but what what all of this has done it has broken the order and program of God this is why we got so much problem yes sir true but preach now come on we could get down into some stuff yes sir it looks good on the surface right but but when we when we really look at these things based upon the word of God you realize the devil has been having his way right glory to God having his way because amen if my wife is out working you know who that with the children right then the Propet say we got babysitters and all this kind of stuff right glory to God and and and listen I'm not telling sisters not to go to work go to work in the morning now but but I'm just saying how you know Satan slipped in and put the women in the workforce right and and now if if you look at if you look at social media which I do because I'm just trying to be informative and and the things that they talk about you know you realize this stuff is not being based upon the word of God but this is what's being F to our young sisters and this The Narrative to our young Brothers right but it's it's contrary to the word of God because when the order was set in Genesis the sweat was supposed to be upon Adam's br yes sir Adan was supposed to go to work right glory to God and be the provider come onen and Eve was supposed to bring forth children right amen she was supposed to be uh uh the first little influence that the CH the child had the first teacher right but how you going to teach something when you working every day you come home and screaming child I'm tired go go somewhere and sit down and nowaday with all of this stuff we got you hand them a phone or you hand them something Talent TI huh and and then look at the amounting pressure that that that that all of this stuff is building we wonder why you know families are exploding wives are walking away and husbands is quitting and walking away and children don't care they out killing and whatnot right cuz the the order of things has been broken amen right and we grabbing and this and it look good and it look nice we got Fine Cars and clothes and this I ain't telling you don't rideing you I like the nice stuff too but but I realize all of these things come as at a cost look at look at the look at look at the cost They Don't Preach this everywhere cuz they people don't really understand that and then we say well you know women live and this and that come on that's carnal we talking about the order of God biblical principles right amen if we're talking about anything come on church we not you know like I say don't quit your jobs I'm not telling you that but I'm just telling you how the enemy has has infiltrated the homes and look at the amountain stress and amountain pressure and how he's invaded the USA right and and then now and now with all of this stuff look at the economy right look at look at the economy and then this Young Generation they ain't even be built because they don't have the concepts they don't even understand the principles of of what it takes to even navigate and survive because you because we make it easy and and people used to ask you spoil your CH children you spoil your daughter no for what why what's the purpose I love I made sure she had spoil for what why she got to get a husband she got to get a husband see and and you you you know for my kids I did what was was necessary sir to show example and that's why they go anywhere they go and out work everybody cuz they saw me going to work every day my son put on a post on Facebook he said I might not have got a million dollars from my daddy but I got wor work ethic [Music] Hallelujah see I didn't get nothing from my daddy at all period NADA he was a rolling stone when he left me he just left me alone Lord huh so everything that I learned and everything that I got amen I got it on my own right by the grace of God Amen raising six children and taking care of of a wife amen that was the grace of God come on that was the that was the grace of God and being in a position right glory to God Amen it get tight sometime and when it get tight sisters you know uh you just got to appreciate the efforts that the man is putting forth to try to make you happy as possible Right am it ain't going to be sunny always everything ain't going to be good the prophet said we go through Seasons we go it it it's seasons of rain you you got you got Seasons where you got a big fat Harvest right sir you might have 5 10,000 in the bank 20,000 and then you get a season with seem like everything in the house breaking down and you watching them thousands go to Hunters yes and then them times you got to keep on grinning see oh glory to God Amen and see you see man brother matter what's all this about see you you got to these things help you to be fit for the position right the experiences right make you fit yes sir glory to God Amen you might look at me but you know I realize you know the things that I've gone through God allowed me to go through them and is allowing me to go through through these things and you you really can't comprehend what I'm going through amen uh unless you in it cuz I I feel you know I'm I smile and you know I look like for the most part I'm happy but I have my my my times where I get emotional and I I feel like God and then God said get up bro get up I can't talk to you like that come on come on girl come on stand up dress yourself up G yourself like a man then I'mma talk to you huh I'm I'mma talk to you right it ain't the time is it's see look at resilience yes sir right it's is being able to bounce back right amen right when your finances gone when everything gone when it when you know have you ever been to the place where you your relationship feel like it's on the brink oh y'all won't preach with me ohoo Lord this powerful ain't it somebody need this this morning amen and and in these times you know know you don't know what to do with your children you got to be resilient yes sir come on you you gotta have you gotta you let me tell you what has helped me with my children right this ain't bad y'all hold on to y'all seats I start saying children and wife y'all get nervous listen listen look this is what helped me with with with dealing with my children right I had to go back and realize I was sick 17 yes and I had to look at my life and what I was doing at 17 and what I was putting my mama through and my aunt num through and grandmother the people that I live with up to 17 18 19 20 up to 25 right and that made a difference because we holier than thou now we say Sanctified Holy Ghost Field fire baptized Mighty five but we fail to realize we we was we was them once upon a time now uh we got the token applied but I want y'all to hear me real good we we got to understand how to get down on their level and work on their level and think like a 17 years old in order to win them right because a lot of times they can't comprehend 60 year old thoughts at 17 they'll gravitate to it right you got to you got to you got to deal with them and talk to them and be patient right c c listen listen and and this is why you can't hardly listen to folk T if I was you not don't do that every church is Sovereign don't do that I learned that early on when I started pting Bible truth Tabernacle I had some some friends that I thought were mature that I could lean on you know when I first started I realized man those guys was a detriment my Lord the church wouldn't have stood for 23 years if I would have listen to them right because they were trying to prolite the folk and everything else Lord misinformation and bad information and prolite spirits and all other kind of spirits was being released Lord right glory to God Amen and sometimes and sometimes you know even with with with folk you you look at those guys and you think you know you think that they got the goods and so you try to yeah I watch this and I'm G to preach and and you watch them and you try to sneakingly behind the pastor back get their number and call them to your detriment to your detriment God knows amen where he places you right where he plant plants you and the man he's given to govern your soul cuz these guys ain't concerned about governing you they they concerned about prelighting you and getting you over here and then you just be one in the number that's right amen I know from experience yes sir right God God gives us God gives us um uh uh servants not hariring real servants after his heart that's concerned about the hearts and the life of of of the people is that right who understands the responsibility and the weight that's that's on them they the O of the team they've been built through through through through time yes sir you watch brother Jack Jack uh God was cultivating brother Jack way at brother Westco church I realized you know um my experiences with the streets and drugs and gang culture and all of those different things it was Culvert cultivating a a mindset right and then getting saved and and and and grasping the word it was culted it was all for my benefit everything wasn't good everything that I went through coming up wasn't good some of the things that I'm going through now don't feel good don't taste good to me ain't good sometime I tell God Lord God this ain't good I don't care what the Bible say this ain't good this don't look good this don't feel good crazy y'all know what I'm talking about cuz look at Job J job was a man that didn't no evil
