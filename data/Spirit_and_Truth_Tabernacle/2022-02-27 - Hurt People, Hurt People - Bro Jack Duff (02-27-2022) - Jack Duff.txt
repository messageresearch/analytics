specials that went forth and amen [Applause] last time i believe sister shalom i think she played and sang for herself the last time she did that i was i was not here and i'm glad she played again today so uh i appreciate just appreciate our young sisters [Applause] cause i was just sitting there in the office i was just thinking um they they're they're part of a spirit of truth 2.0 and um you know i was thinking when our kids got started and how young they were and you know and just um actually you know it's actually part of my story i started very very young as well i'm not sure was [Music] praise the lord want to get away [Music] that was good that was good classic brother [Music] but when i was young a teenager started in song leading and um and i remember they should say that they could barely see my head above the pulpit uh you know i was so young serving the lord and then uh when our kids came along they got started very young uh serving the lord uh and um and very very very happy with uh what the lord has done in their lives and now i'm seeing this next generation uh come and and starting very young serving the lord uh it means a lot when you get started young it means a lot and uh you know um we have uh sister rachel today will be her last day with us amen she'll be they were making their move to south carolina and we we thank god for the years of service she has provided we trust him that the lord will just continue to use you as you go forward uh and uh you know i'm just i know that we got sister rebecca also a few weeks from now she'll be making the same transition but i'm just looking at god and i want y'all to do me a favor i know it's kind of hard to do this with your mask on i know it's kind of hard to to do this but i want you to just take a deep breath then let it hold out somebody told me something that has blessed me they say the church is a living organism and being a living organism we [Music] uh inhale and then we exhale and then we inhale and then we exhale and and when you're doing that you don't realize every time you do that you are it shows that you're living so inhale you begin to bring people in and bring them up exhale you have to let them go but we're a living organism we still inhale and we exhale god is control of every breath so church i want to tell you to do something breathe just breathe [Music] just breathe [Music] [Applause] just breathe [Music] now we thank the lord so uh i got a couple things that i need to do here today and uh i don't want to keep you standing too long so just turn in your bibles uh with me i'm going to read a scripture and then uh i need to just make a few comments before i actually get into the sermon uh genesis 50. oh musicians thank y'all thank y'all so much appreciate y'all amen i um i was very pleased with just how the saints began to enter into the worship before the song leader came up this morning that sets atmospheres amen this makes it real easy so god bless you all uh here in genesis 15 uh verse 19 uh it says this and joseph said unto them fear not for uh am i in the place of god but as for you he thought evil against me but god meant it unto good to bring to pass as it is this day to save much people alive uh now therefore fear you not i will nourish you and your little ones and they confident them and speak kindly unto them amen let's have a word of prayer lord jesus we are um grateful for the opportunity to read the word but god we know it takes the holy ghost to bring understanding and quickening to what is read lord help us to apply what we have read here realize that it's not just the story of joseph but it's our stories and so god help us lord and uh to apply this and uh lord as uh just appreciate everything that has happened thus far in the service and god want to take a moment to uh express our appreciation for a precious sister rachel lord as well as brother stephen and god with them making a transition to south carolina we ask that you would go before them that you would bless all that they set their hands to do and as she is served so faithfully here in this church god may you continue to use her for your glory uh as she goes forth there to brother armstrong's assembly uh user god in a very special way may they be both an encouragement and a strength more to that congregation god we just commit them into your hands and lord we just want to ask that you would just continue to take control of this portion of the service and uh we felt your presence and all the rest of it but now god we need you to go forth and i'll just make the word clear to us on today father it's in jesus name we pray amen amen god bless you you can be seated in the presence of the lord this quote that i want to read amen this first quote is really more of a to deal with modern events and um i'm i'm preaching a man a different i'm preaching a sermon that i've been telling you all that i want to preach my title today is hurt people hurt people amen uh but before i get started in that i just needed to bring a modern event you all are very aware of this war that is taking place uh in the ukraine and um this i'm setting up a quote from the angel the lord uh just a statement that the prophet is making here um and there there are a number of things that could be triggering you know this you you hear so much in the news you don't know what to believe and what not to believe and and all of that uh but um you know that there's a a lot happening sanctions and and and and all these things and uh and there's so many prophecies out there about watch russia watch russia watch russia um you know i believe i believe brother branham even said that they might be the ones that set a senate bomb in a hit fourth street in louisville something like that you know real close to jeffersonville uh but you know he also talked about russia using a bomb to hit to strike the vatican uh so you know there's a lot here that we have to be mindful of and the one thing that that i believe is that before i get too bad i i believe that there's a rapture awaiting the church and uh and and my encouragement to you all this morning is like hey uh it might be closer than we think so let's live lives amen a daily that what that god would be pleased with right live lives daily because you just don't know when this thing is going to turn right uh the people there in ukraine had no no idea they would wake up or go to bed one night and bombs just landing all over the place they had no idea that would happen your world can change just like that so you need to be prepared spiritually don't take our coming to church amen uh just as a routine but we're here to get a checkup we're here to we're here to make corrections where we need to make corrections we're here to get instruction from god we're here to amend it here with a spiritual ear amen so that we can be prepared for the hour which we live so i wanted to just read this this quote here uh from uh the prophet out of the angel of the lord uh he says here the word of the little lamb that rose up in revelation 13. uh a lamb too little probably a little horn civil and ecclesiastical power but after is a lamb freedom of religion and so forth but after a while he spake like a beast a man like like the dragon now now now revelation 13 actually types the united states this is where brother branham places the united states so you know they spake like a um uh they first now notice that it came here for freedom of religion they came here for freedom of religion but i want you to know that things are turning really quickly where your religion or your faith is going to be challenged hallelujah amen she says but after a while he spake like a beast like the dragon and exercise all the power the dragon did before him a bitter religious persecution now watch these statements that the prophet is making uh because as as we go deeper in this quote go back to this thought of bitter religious persecution he says we're nearing that time he says you remember church that you're living in the best day my god that you'll ever that you you will ever live in right now until jesus comes he says it shall gradually says not gradually but rapidly my rapidly get worse and worse and when russia goes down there to get that oil look out now uh you gotta understand there's a pipeline that flows through ukraine that has oil going in and and and everything like that so russia understands what's behind all this right so so so we know that there's uh you know there there's there's a political agenda there's a financial agenda and one of one of the main sanctions that has happened is that they come against of the money they won't allow them to trade money right so so they're trying to the economy we got to watch these things this is very very important but but notice what he says here now he says um when russia goes down there to get that oil look out he says that's all she needs that's what the prophet said it would do and we're ready for it then so church get ready to meet christ hallelujah he's sending great revivals and meetings and stirring the full gospel people signs and wonders appearing everywhere great wonders to draw his people together and one day he shall come the deliverer now notice you know before he said amen when russia goes down to get that oil look out before he said it he said a bitter religious persecution you know and i was reading an article this week and you know someone had made a statement a man they just posted it on social media it was a another country i believe i believe was in i know it's one of your uh accomplishers in your i finished i think it's a finished finished person that's in politics and she posted a scripture and um and then i think there was another bishop you know that came in and kind of echoed some sentiments on the scripture and and i think the scripture said something it was it was it was against uh alternative lifestyle and all they did was just post scripture and um you know and from that lady posting that scripture they want to bring her to court and try to try to get her uh sentence for two years for posting a scripture right and uh you know here you know when brother branham say a bit of persecution against religion these are a bitter religious persecution these are things that if this stuff gets passed over there quickly we will start rapidly is what he said we'll start seeing these things come our way and where should we be spiritually amen as we see these things approaching so church that's why i want to encourage you amen don't just take these things lightly a prophet spoke this to us and what we need at this very moment is to draw closer and closer to christ everything else just don't matter amen but we want to get closer and closer to christ there was a song that used to say only what you do for christ will last amen only what you do for him will be counted in the end only what we do for christ will last let's draw closer closer closer closer to the lord just dropping that off and amen i want to just turn our corner here because uh this has been in my heart for some time um and i felt to you know just bring it up and even i was i think i told you before a couple weeks ago that i was going to preach this and then brother brother danny came and started hitting some things even when as he took his his subject last week he took us through luke chapter 4 and showed how when jesus stood up in the temple and says this date of scripture is fulfilled it showed how the people got mad how the people got angry you know with the word the revealed words standing in their presence and we're finding the same thing today people are angry with the revealed word people are mad with the revealed word uh but but what i what i what i've kind of you know come to conclude amen is that a lot of the people that are that are doing this are what i consider hurt people amen glory to god and and and if you just had the opportunity sometimes just to sit and talk with folk amen you'll realize that that they're hurting oh glory to god even you know brother solomon was sharing a little uh testimony about a brother that used to preach the gospel got hurt ministers can be hurt and ministers can be hurt right i mean the people in the congregation can be hurt you know we uh uh uh you go through your neighborhood you go to school you go to work wherever you go you are surrounded by people that are hurting and and the the the difficult part here is that hurt people will actually hurt people amen you don't want to be one of those kind of people and then let me let me let me also just kind of uh uh uh mention this way all of us in here have been hurt by something everybody in here there's not one one person within the sound of my voice that has not been hurt it's what you do with the hurt see that that i mean because all of us get hurt somewhere and life is full of hurts life is full of disappointments right you can't stop life from happening but it's how you respond to her now this definition that i want to use i'm using a lot of um material here from the internet uh the definition of hurt people uh says people who have been hurt or damaged in life sometimes respond by striking out and hurting the people who are around them this is what it means when we say hurt people hurt people people who are who have been hurt or damaged in life sometimes respond by striking out and hurting the people who are around them now i want to another little article that uh that i was um reading because uh you know we all we all we all deal with it uh i've said as brother brother solomon talked about the brother used to preach the gospel and you know and and that's family hurt that he's having that that's family hurt you know his wife this his wife that that's family hurt we all have this type of stuff but it take the grace of god to carry us through this right uh this is a article that was that i was reading a man on a wife that constantly belittled her husband amen constantly every time he did something she was there to belittle him now this don't just happen it's just an article i happen to be reading about the wife doing that but i know husbands do the same thing my the wife tried to do this and the husband right there trying to belittle her amen it's a true thing i know we're going to get close to home in this sermon glory to god we might as well preach it anyway hey [Applause] amen hallelujah but but this is what happens and and what i'm trying to what i'm trying to get you to see when you see patterns like that amen oftentimes you might not realize but there's a hurt on the inside that that person has never never overcome and this is why they keep acting the way that they act oh glory to god you know just just recently somebody gave me a telephone call and and they were just telling me how um you know they just couldn't take it anymore they ready to to go on with their life and get out of the marriage and and all these things and i say oh my my my and by the time i hear it the person already made up their mind so i'm sitting there praying you know why i'm talking to him like lord give me something that i can say but they don't make everybody well she won't do this and she won't do that and she won't do this well now this now when you uh when you was living such and such did she do those things no she didn't do it didn't either i said well wait if she do it then she ain't doing that ain't nothing change ain't nothing really change you know just let's just wait before you just throw in the towel i say now now what we need to do is go back and just honor god amen see what god's word say about these things and honor god in his word and watch god turn that thing around hallelujah i say the reason that she might not do the things that she you know you say she should do like you know let me just give an example maybe a husband is upset that his wife don't cook now see if you recorded her the right way you would have been able to take some of her food before you married her but you rushed it i know i'm talking you rushed it and you never did go over and get no food praise the lord right you rushed that thing and now now you're not married and now you now you now you you in this now right but but maybe if you would have had a chance to kind of corner and do some things you would have found out that maybe the reason she don't cook is that she might have tried to cook but when she tried to cook maybe she burnt something the first time and maybe something was sad in the house about her mama about her daddy that crushed her spirit it crushed her spirit and now she don't want to cook but you didn't get it you didn't get a chance to actually minister to her because what you need to do is find out what she can cook good and encourage her in that baby every time you cook this i just enjoy it and sometimes why's you got to find an area about your husband that's really going to keep echoing that come on somebody but but because what happened is that she got hurt in a family and now she takes that into her marriage and hurt people hurt people begin to hurt people we have to be able to dig deeper into situations and circumstances you know watch why you have to you know you got to be spiritual because uh sometimes you can just see you know and and as a husband you got to be able to minister to his wife in areas that she might be hurting that she's never even said anything to anybody about maybe embarrassed to say something about it uh uh wise you got to do the same thing with your husband you got to find a way to minister to him because he maybe he's embarrassed glory to god you don't know what what has created the psyche in a person but hurt people begin to hurt people and it becomes an endless cycle so this this this article that i was reading on this wife who kept i mean every time the husband did something she was belittling her husband i always find a way to put him down saying every time i get a promotion on the job she got something negative to say and and and the person was responding because he's he sent a a question and and i guess this this person was responding to this question hurt people hurt others hurt people tend to interpret words and behaviors personally and tend to think of themselves as victims who have been treated unfairly hurt people always see themselves as victims amen it's because of this it's because of that and this happened and that happened no no no no at some point in time you got to stop being a victim and you got to be a victor i said it earlier i said again everybody in here has been hurt it's how we respond to it you know the prophet saying the right mental attitude towards any divine promise will bring it to pass so often times when you face saying anything in life you got to have a right attitude and i'm going to tell you what a right attitude is in the attitude of gratitude hurt people hurt others hurt people tend to interpret words and behaviors personally and tend to think of themselves as victims who have been treated unfairly hurt people tend to mistreat or act harshly towards others especially those close to them because those are the people they feel the safest and most secure around they have trouble tolerating virtually any type of emotional injury they have trouble tolerating any type of emotional slight or insult or or threat without feeling the need to forcefully retaliate which means that they perpetually they are perpetually at war with someone most of the time hurt people hurt people sometimes we're hurt by our friends sometimes we're hurt by co-workers sometimes we're hurt by classmates amen it happens in life you just can't you can't stop it you know uh uh you know i was one of the things as i was just kind of pondering on this you know there's a lot going on in the world and i'm a i'm gonna just be honest i think i'm gonna have a two-part series on this because i i was putting all my notes together i said lord ain't no way i just i'm trying to just doctor this up a certain way but i'm gonna just have to just let it let it fly right but um one of the things that kind of grabbed my attention is all the riots that that that happened in our in our country and how you see different people even believers sad to say this but believers taking sides with one or the other right and and and you know and and i mean i understand police brutality uh and not it's not right i don't i don't believe that to be right but i don't believe it right for some of the things that the other guys do either amen right but but you know we got we got um sometimes it's human error but but a human error amen will be categorized as police brutality and as soon as somebody put that on it and you just let it be two different races oh my hear that devil that devil that that that was defeated years ago hear that devil come right back up again and next thing was brought right into the church and you don't realize that hurt people are still hurting people the responses are our responses from hurt people they see themselves as victims all the time oh my my mind at some point in time you got to stop looking at yourself like that i'ma tell you a victim always responds in a certain way and then they justify their actions because they feel like they're victims no this is a hurt person this is a hurt person let me uh move on there's family hurt a mother that maybe didn't receive love when she was a child she might have difficulty expressing love to her own children and then then the kids grew up my mama didn't do this by moment but she don't understand your mama didn't have the tools that she needed in order to be what you wanted her to be and can i tell you go a little further you already have in your mind what a mama's supposed to be you don't create it in your mind what a dad is so supposed to be and you're not a mama nor daddy so you don't understand what what goes on and the responsibility that goes with that and the decisions that have to be made sometime come on somebody right but but you gotta understand that look look look uh god is the one that chose the family that you would arrive here through you didn't make the choice god made the choice and he put you in an environment and yes in that environment you were going to experience some hurt but it's how you respond you can't blame mama see sometimes what it is is that god's trying to get you to see your mama is not your all all-in-all and your daddy is not your all-in-all but i'll be he said i'll be all that you need you need a mama i be your mama you need a daddy i'll be your daddy you need a brother i'll be your brother you need a sister i'll be your sister whatever you need i can be all that and more young man who did not have a father growing up will have a difficult time being a father when it becomes his turn he didn't have a father he didn't have an example he didn't have that and oftentimes what we want to say well the word of god gives us a you know we we we it's very it's very um easy to use things like that but if you're going to use that you have to also turn that that certain that same sword back to you because when you start complaining about this person not doing that next thing you're just gonna find some scripture as to why you shouldn't be doing what you're doing see we gotta we gotta understand the scriptures say um uh uh uh uh you worried about getting amen the moat out of somebody else's eye it's just a little splinter but you got a huge bean two by four four by four sticking out your eye and you ain't doing nothing about it hallelujah what we need to do is just concentrate on us sometimes people are hurt just by life untimely or unexpected death of a loved one sometimes a a a a family losing a child amen these are things that hurt and and oftentimes uh some people can't recover they were serving god and you know and then they go through something real difficult in life or not now they talk about giving up on god and and they say well if if if this was the you know uh if god loved me he would not allow these things to happen to me you know i remind i reminded of brother brand i'm going through this as a as as a as a husband as a father i mean in his early age early stage of ministry here uh uh a flood comes and you know he's just doing everything he can to try to help everybody else and while he's helping everybody else his wife is in the hospital sick and dying with his baby now you got to think about this you know this is before he started out on the field he's going through you talk about hurt oh yeah he was hurt i mean in there trying to take care of everybody else now my my wife is leaving and then within within days his baby is gone right i mean what what could he do he said brother branham said his baby died um so so bad it was just so hard that her eyes crossed while she was dying and and from that experience from that experience of him seeing amen his baby's eyes crossed amen god gave him a sensitive nature that when he saw other people with cross side sometimes the prophet didn't even have to pray for him the prophet would just look at a person with cross eyes and their eyes were straightened up he had all he had he was able to identify with what that person was going through based on what he saw his baby go through let me tell you something god wanna use your hurt for his glory [Applause] here he lost his baby lost his wife all in a matter of days and i hear he's trying to take everybody but you know during that time uh somebody come along and they asked him a question they uh said brother branham did you hold on to god while you was going through that you know you lost this you lost that did you hold on to god why you was going through all that brother random you know told saying no because she a hurt person ready to give up i mean and there was many times brother branham tried to kill himself brother branham fought the spirit of suicide the prophet did hurt people go through things like this hallelujah but but i'm so glad that he actually told us about these things that he was going through as a human being but we see how god used that for his glory so yeah i tried i tried to say did you did you hold on to god during those times say i'll be honest i ain't hold on to him hey buddy held on to me and and that's that's the good thing about it that he's holding on to us hey when it don't feel like he's working he's working when it don't seem like he's working he's working oh jesus there's a statement here when we when we're dealing with hurt people the statement here we're not here to criticize anybody because hurt is something that all of us have to endure in the family hurting the church and and i won't have i don't think i'm gonna have time to get to maybe i will maybe i will let's let's read a story this is hurting the church my notes are all over the place but um i think it'll be helpful for us so let's let's read the story go go with me to first kings chapter three hurt people hurt people first kings chapter 3. i want to start at verse 16. now this story amen it's not really don't have the word church in it but we have to um type it to the church because oftentimes when we see women in the bible uh women are representing the church so here the bible says then came there two women that were harlots unto the king and stood before him and the one woman said oh my lord i and this woman dwell in one house and i was delivered of a child with her in the house and it came to pass the third day after that i was delivered that this woman was delivered also and we were together there was no stranger with us in the house save we too in the house so let's get this let's let's try to follow this these ladies were of the same profession they had the same job they were co-workers can i put it that way is that all right these ladies are co-workers sometimes your co-workers can cause you some some hurt not only are they co-workers what we find in just these few versus scriptures these women are roommates they're roommates and sometimes you know we've had that happen where you know you've been hurt by a roommate come on somebody right but but the bible says that they lived in the same house and the other thing we found out that both of them were pregnant at the same time now look at this they're telling a story verse 19 it says and and this woman's child died in the night because she overlaid it she smothered on child says and she and she arose at midnight and took my son from beside me while my handmaid slept and laid it in her bosom and laid her dead child in my bosom now you know this just it's just really really something to me because you know um that only reason that this lady could even think to do something like this is because maybe at the early stage the children looked so much alike they had to be a man of uh you know just just uh i mean they had to be so similar it's no way that if these was two different colored babies that this mama would even think to do now i know she ain't gonna go for that amen one baby yelling one black and i know that ain't gone i know she ain't gonna go for that but they both have to be of the same ethnic you know background they all they both got you know oh good god almighty all right you know my my imagination goes goes fast sometimes it goes very far because they lived in the same house they had the same profession is it possible is it possible they got the same daddy so when when we look at this you know we see all these things that they have and and and but the problem is is a mother knows a child you ain't gonna fool no mother and you actually ain't gonna fool a child either because a child knows his mama's voice i mean everybody else trying to get that cop that child calling me just crying or she crying and everybody trying to get a child come but all of a sudden mama comes around and just touched the child just look look only mama can can minister in certain areas that only she can nobody else will mama knowing a child going through mama just started getting on the knees and praying something going wrong with my child i don't know what it is lord i have to wait for my child to call me and tell me what's going on but i know something is happening but let me just start praying right now there's a connection between a mother and a child because of that umbilical cord ain't nothing gonna break it i say ain't nothing gonna break it can i tell you something daddy stop trying to break can i say it again daddy stop stop trying to break that relationship between the mother and the child don't do that there's a connection there and it'll always be there verse 20. she rose at midnight and took my son from beside me while thine handmaid slept and laid it in her bosom and laid her dead child in my bosom and when i rose in the morning to give my child suck behold it was dead when i had considered it in the morning before it was not my son which i did bear at first she upset like my child died what happened she just started thinking wait a minute wait a minute wait a minute that ain't my child and you know and without living with this lady maybe she probably said no she sleep wild i've seen her sleep i i know i don't sleep that way ain't no way i would have been able to kill this child like this let's keep going verse 22 says and the other woman said nay brother living is my son and the dead is thy son and this said no but the dead is that son and the living is my son you can imagine what they're going through in this household now i'm almost quite sure that after the judgment amen was passed in this case and some of y'all already know where it's going but after the judgment passed i guarantee that lady got her stuff and got out that house if you do this to me to me with my own baby what else would you do see hurt people hurt people hurt people verse 23 uh i'm verse 22 and and they said no but the dead is thy son and and the limit is my son thus they spake before the king then said the king the one saith this is my son that liveth and thy son is there and the other said neighbor thy son is the dead and my sons are living and the king said bring me a sword because see this lady don't mind splitting the church i heard brother burley say that one time when he was reading this story i said ain't number the truth you got some people that don't care about splitting the church others will try to keep it together but hurt people see themselves as the victim look at it now and the king said bring me sword and they brought a sword before the king and the king said divide the living child in two and give half to the one and and half to the other then spoke the woman who's the living child was unto the king for her bowels yearned upon her son she said oh my lord give her the living child and in no way i slay it but the other said let it be neither mine nor thine but divided you see her actions actually showed who she really was and can i put it this way she is a murderer she murdered her first child she's ready to murder the second child she'll murder any child i'm gonna tell you why because something is going on in his latest life she's a hurt person and hurt people tend to hurt people then the king answered and said give her the living child and in no way slay it she is the mother thereof and all israel heard of the judgment which the king had judged and they feared the king for they saw that the wisdom of god was in him to do judgment and you know just just from that that story like i said we can if we type it to the church you have hurt people in the church everybody everybody and it hurt it's how you handle how you respond to your hurt is what really matters most don't be like the woman that's willing to split a church i don't care what i don't care who hurt see i want other people to feel my pain hurt people hurt people i don't want people to feel my pain i want to feel my joy let's go on a little further here oh glory to god you know we we we we you know when when you're dealing with these things and like i say um in family situations especially when uh maybe a child feel like my mama didn't love me the way that i thought she should love me or my daddy didn't do this and my daddy didn't do that and you know we we all gonna have that look uh i i'm a i'm a product of uh of of of of of a divorced family at a very young age parents divorced growing up um i mean in a household where we had a blended family right this this come from hurt people these environments where hurt was just all around come on y'all y'all ain't gonna talk to me but but we all products of it all of us are we we all come from environments like this look uh uh um just by being born in sin just by being born and seeing we couldn't help these environments but it's what we do and and i'm one you know i was i called my stepfather daddy that's all i knew as daddy that's all i knew i mean in in all honesty oh lord i i i ain't getting nowhere where i want to be in all honesty it took my stepdad my i called him daddy but when my when my biological father was dying in the hospital the man was dying in the hospital they told me he had congestive heart failure and all these other things and i'm like what and y'all want me to what you want me to do my boss say you need to go see your daddy my dad ain't never come see me so now now he want me to come see him see that's a hurt person it took my my step daddy set me down he's sick as i don't know what and he sit me down and say he said jack you need to go see your daddy you my daddy you need to go see your father i said yes okay dad went and got my tickets and and went on got there to the hospital and got to the hospital they you know i'm i got to go to alabama and so i fly to atlanta and get a car from atlanta get over the hospital and and when i get there my he's sleeping i'm like well nothing i can do and so the nurse i say does he ever wake up they say yeah you wake up all the time every day i said well i'm gonna leave and i'm gonna come back you know i'll come back um y'all call me and let me know when they wake up so i got i got out went and got something to eat and they come and say that is up i said okay i come right back to the hospital i get there he sleep and i went to the nurse i said y'all told me he was up i get back here he sleep what what they said no no your daddy's up i say she walk into the room and just say uh mr duff i say um and i mean she talked to my dad said mr duff he said yeah he says turn and look returning look i was sitting in a chair he said oh it came and he was just happy to see me and we had a chance to talk about life we had a chance to talk about god we had a chance to talk about a lot of things i i mean you know he because of the the life that he lived and the sin that he was in his church wouldn't even preach his funeral but he had a son that grew up in a different environment that god called to the ministry and i said if they won't do it i can do it and i went back the next week after i left the hospital within about about about hours within hours after left he had gone on i'm i'm grateful i had the opportunity to see him i mean you know i i can i can i'm out here now i might as well just say these things but i remember when i was younger because of the family you know growing up in a blended family i wanted to change my last name i wanted to change my last name i wanted to be a burst that's what i wanted but my daddy my i call him daddy you got a brother roosevelt burst he said no don't change your name keep your name and i'ma tell you i didn't understand it then but when i buried my biological father his name is jackie duff and my name is jackie duff i realized what my name meant you see we all have things we go through in life that provides hurt it's how we respond to it they made the statement it's easy to understand someone else when we walk a mile in their moccasins as the old saying goes here's a is a fact of life hurt people hurt people if someone's hurting you he's acting this way because he is hurting hurt people hurt others and what we need to do is look beyond people's faults and see their needs because that's exactly what our lord and savior did for us stop blaming mama stop blaming daddy look beyond their faults and see their needs then we can learn to love let's go to proverbs 18 and 14. this is a statement here from solomon and um i i love it see the spirit of a man will sustain his infirmity but a wounded spirit who can bear and you know just some of the commentary around this particular uh passage is oftentimes when we go through an illness in our body or sickness or whatever sometimes your body is so depleted uh there's just not much you can do but what gives you a man the strength to actually overcome is what's going on inside your spirit your spirit man is what's sustaining you because the spirit is feeding on the word of god and as as it's feeding on the word of god and listening to the word of god and quoting the word of god it's causing your body to come in line with the confession of your spirit see your spirit is sustaining the infirmity but but here's the problem a wounded spirit when you when you allow hurt to get down to the spirit level a wounded spirit who can bear it so you got to watch yourself you know in this area you know because that's really what satan is after and he'll attack you about i mean you think about job joe went through so much in his body but he kept confessing i know my redeemer liveth uh and one day i'ma see him in the latter day i'ma see i mean he just kept confessing that and i'm gonna tell you another thing you gotta watch who you surround yourself with when you are going through you got to watch the friends that you surround yourself with when you are going through you don't need none of joe's friends come on somebody a joke friend's got a way of just just oh you did this and you did that come on and repent and you ain't doing nothing wrong it's just god trying his servants it's just god trying uh uh his daughter it's just god doing that to see what your response can be you know before the trial came to job that god already knew job was going to overcome and he gave satan a chance to have you considered my servant joe justin upright man i know he won't curse me i know he won't he won't turn around he won't do nothing and we got some modern-day jobs right in the room with us no matter what they're going through and yeah spit yeah my spirit hurt my flesh hurt everything about me hurt but you know what i got i got a a go ahead i gotta go ahead y'all know what that is what a go-head is it's something down on the inside of you and and and all it all it only got two words there's something on the inside you got two words that he always speaking to you he said go ahead go ahead go hey it's good to have a go ahead that's what keep me coming to church is my go ahead when i'm hurt and i'm disappointed i still gotta go ahead that's what puts a smile on my face when i'm frowning on the inside because i gotta go ahead god put a goal ahead in me thank god for it spirit of a man will sustain him in his infirmity but a wounded spirit who can bear it and and i'm going to tell you a wounded spirit who can bear i want to just kind of take this from a different angle because you know brother branham say that we all are a man without the holy ghost is nothing but an animal without the holy ghost ain't nothing but an animal and i want to there's a little little thing that i read here about animals sick injured or unhealthy animals it said sick animals can be dangerous the most dangerous animal you can encounter in day to day life is an injured or a sequin it can be very tempting i better hear on this now it can be very tempting to approach the animal to attempt to help it i mean you think you're doing something right by approaching a sick or an injured animal you got to be careful right hey man you you might end up hurt by trying to attack a hurt animal or help a hurt animal right it says it can be very tempting to approach the animal to attempt to help it especially if it's in pain it's very important you resist this impulse an injured animal may perceive you as a threat looking to capitalize on their weakened state when animals lack other means to competently defend themselves they have to be far more aggressive than usual most people who sustain animal related injuries approach the attacking animal with good intentions remember no no matter how evident their behavior may seem you do not know what a wild animal is thinking even experts with years of experience routine misread animal signals so you got to be careful and see as human beings we have the nature of animals right we have we have that nature and and uh only the holy ghost can come and change that so oftentimes you might see a hurt person what you're trying to do is get them try to just be careful because you might get hurt in the process sometimes it's best just to pray and i'ma tell you something that i've learned to do wait yes just wait wait don't be so quick to jump on everything wait somehow it work out without you saying nothing you're in a man is what gives you the strength to keep pressing forward when one is physically hurt it usually causes them to retreat right so if you if you if you're sick or you're hurt it causes you to kind of retreat you don't want to be around everybody especially now we're going with covet we actually don't want you around everybody right we we would like for you to stay home amen right you got symptoms stay home it's okay you you're gonna get over it we praying for you gonna come on back out but but but when you when you're sick retreat what happens when people are hurt or injured or something like that they spend a lot of time in isolation and they're trying to work through the pain that's physically guess what happens spiritually the same thing happens when one is hurting in that spirit they begin to retreat you won't see them at fellowships they're avoiding this they're more than that they're hurt in their spirits and what happens hurt people will hurt people give them a little time god will bring them through let me um just kind of mention something here i i'ma i was gonna oh lord just oh my let me just see how i want to do this i got like i told you i got a lot of little things so i was talking about family hurt hurt by friends um hurt by life untimely deaths and one of the big things in family hurt is um when parents are divorced and parents get a divorce that's a big family hurt um and i know you know not everybody get married to get divorced it's not why we do that but things happen in in relationships hurt happens in relationships and things just happen that that you don't have any control over but nonetheless when it happens it does not minimize the impact that that that that that is seen in our children um sometimes infidelity will impact relationships now let me just stop and just talk a little bit about this because in in in in our world we we see infidelity as insurmountable we see it that way but i want to understand that it was infidelity at the beginning with adam and eve and somehow adam overcame adam overcame it now if we would get back to adam type thinking then we can overcome some of those things i ain't gonna say it's gonna be easy but i can tell you that if adam did it we can do it even even from a spiritual sense god himself forgave israel for their infidelity and he said in his word i'm married to you so so we have to get a thought process that no we in this thing to to the end right so so so uh but i was just kind of doing some you know research and things like that and and and i i i saw uh when infidel infidelity happens in a relationship husband and wife um infidelity often leads the other party to seeking revenge so if if if the husband goes out on the wife the wife gonna start seeking revenge if the wife goes out and her husband the husband gonna start seeking revenge that's what the devil put in their mind right and and what what that is it's a desire to seek additional hurt i'm hurt i'm a victim and i want to see you hurt and when this occurs it begins to add a new strain to the family dynamics hallelujah and sometimes the pressure gets too great so divorce seems to be the only option and let me tell you something there's a way that seemeth right until man but the end thereof are the ways of death broken families impact uh on the children um these are some of the statistics that show when children are raised in a a single-parent household one of them says children who grow up in unstable environments are more susceptible to live in unstable environments later on in life uh children begin to suffer uh poorly in their academics in school um it also said when parents when children have to go through this they end up in a financial challenge because they don't have the two incomes coming to the household anymore oh come on somebody and even though daddy might be on child support that's still not all the money that daddy used to bring into the house so mama's still trying to make it work y'all ain't gonna talk to me today and now you blaming mama because she has it mama ain't get my man have it all like she used to have it when daddy was there these things create financial challenges in a home and now that kid feel like i can't get this because see it affects them in the psyche they also say it produces anger and irritability irritability in the child they have a difficulty adapting to changes they have difficulty adapting to changes the child becomes emotionally sensitive another thing that happens is that the child sometimes have a feeling of guilt as if it was their fault to cause the marriage to dissolve and ultimately what the devil's doing is striking that that child striking that they're trying striking at that child to finally where the child gets to the point where they lose faith in the whole system of marriage or even in a family unit that's why you have children growing up saying i don't want no children but you got to understand that the reason that you have been put together is so that god could use you to multiply hurt people hurt people why do people get divorced these are some of the reasons that they say people get divorced lack of commitment they say they argue too much so some say they get married i mean get divorced because of infidelity or some say we married too young we didn't realize what we was doing we was that young no you knew full well what you was doing you can't blame that on youth you're just some things you didn't do right another one is uh unrealistic expectations that's why that's a that's a killer to marriage unrealistic expectations what you expect from her and what she expects i mean all that type of stuff y'all gotta you know one one of the things that that that uh society when we do uh counseling with people uh we always kind of uh tell them say look marriage is not 50 50. who told you that who told you marriage was 50 50. marriage is not that marriage is 100 100. and mary said look when you can't carry your weight i got you [Applause] that's what mary said i i mean that's what love i got you when you can't do it i got you don't worry we're gonna make this we're gonna work through this thing together but now you need to bring your 50 percent you ain't coming up you ain't doing your part no that that's an unrealistic expectation another one they say is uh lack of equality in the relationship y'all ain't gonna talk to me i'm gonna say that again let's say the reason that marriages break down is because of a lack of equality in a relationship you know what that tells me that statement right there say they're gonna have a biblical model for the marriage the husband the husband is the head and every marriage ain't gonna have no two heads if your body got two heads you got a freak body somebody got to be the head so i would just be honest with you sis and i'm not saying like i told y'all it's going to be some political fight i mean religious persecution coming it's coming it's on the way i might as well say these things it's coming anyway i can't stop it from coming so i might as well say look look i mean this world has kind of made sisters think a little different about themselves but we got to go back to what the bible say god called that man to be the head so sister i'm gonna tell you really most of the time you're gonna be the one to submit your idea that's why you need to court and see how that man thinks so you have you have an opportunity to submit because what we what we have nowadays is what we call a silent head just just just underneath behind the scenes she controlling everything and let me tell you when you're a solid head don't think people don't see it people can see that oh a silent head that's trying to control everything and just you know kind of slightly just move over to just have a little can i talk to you to the side oh we know what this is we know what it's all about we married too thank you doing something uh uh you know on the slide no no we that's the silent head talking sometimes you gotta talk with your with your mouth your eyes your body language is saying a lot and we just watching how the husband looking at oh lord a solid head so you got you have to learn that's why you're courting to make sure that he's a he's a man that can kind of handle certain things he watches his decision-making and look and even you know look i believe my wife uh helped me get a lot of blind spots she catch a lot of blind spots for me and i'd be forging her head i'm gonna do this i'm doing this and she said now uh watch that oh i ain't see that over there she's my help mate and i thank god for her help so there's lack of equality in relationship that's because they don't have an understanding of what the role is of the husband and the what the role is of the wife a wife is not a doormat a wife is a helpmate amen you know in one situation brother branham uh was talking giving counsel to a couple uh the the man he when he was in control of money he just messed up the money messed it up so brother branham gave advice to this couple say brother why don't you let your wife handle the finances now that caused that man to be submissive now you want advice from a prophet you just got it let your wife control the money and most men oh no i let not control nothing ain't never i ain't letting them know nothing but if you were to talk to a prophet the prophet let your wife you know what some of us would be in a better financial position right now have we heed it just simple advice like that i told you i i knew i knew i knew lord when i stepped out here what this was going to be i knew i knew i knew i know what i was up against lord but hurt people hurt people and the reason you're so controlling with the finances because you didn't have nothing when you was coming up you was hurt you didn't have nothing so now you got to control everything it's your environment that produced the psyche that made you the person you are now all you got to do is apply biblical principles even when it comes to your finances you watch god bless it husband and wife set financial goals together this how much money we're trying to save oh come on y'all y'all ain't talking to me i've seen a i've seen a couple the husband just working working up something just working trying to make sure this was taken care of trying to make sure and the wife got 10 15 000 sitting in the bank like no yeah you got to get out there and work the man didn't have to do that all they need just use some of the money she had just sitting there just in case things don't work out between us i got me something to fall back on she got an exit strategy why she even marriage how how can you be committed with an exit strategy now if we in this together we in this together but let's set a financial goal like look we're only going to spend this much of this but we're going to keep the rest of it over there and we cannot go below that we got to agree to this and so don't be thinking about that other money sitting there and no don't don't i don't want to hear it cause we agreed that we weren't gonna touch that money that's how you build together husband died money sitting in the couch wife can't even get to it her name not even on the account thousands go back thousands go back to the government your family never enjoy it because hurt people hurt people hurt people a couple other things while marriages fail lack of preparation for marriage they also say domestic violence or abuse is something that creates um problems in marriage so you know and ain't no way that's again that's right there in the bible i i i shouldn't have to read that but the bible tells a man ain't gonna hit his wife if he won't hurt himself he won't hurt his wife anybody read that in the scripture if he won't hurt himself he won't hurt his wife come on somebody amen it's right down the word of god and let me tell you something brother that's not physically don't stop just physically your mouth your mouth you wouldn't want nobody talking to you like that you'd be ready to fight somebody if they rose up talking to you like that will you stop talking to your wife like that amen i i i i notice this is deep i know this is we live in a society full of hurt people you say anything against what somebody believed you hurt them if you hurt them they put you in the category now you've been cancelled cancel culture so you know i've been i i'm not i'm not hip to all this stuff so i had to kind of ask what does this mean then i went to the the the the merriam-webster states that the cancel culture in this context means to stop giving support to a person uh it was it's pretty much withdrawn support oh god that happened in church when you let somebody don't like a sermon oh y'all ain't talking y'all ain't talking this morning you you've become a part of the council culture and sometimes they're gonna withdraw their support so like the church ain't going to live without your support it's god that provides god is the source you are simply a resource in time that is not for the pastor tithing is for you to be blessed this how to decide the enemies rebuked in your household that's god's plan but but don't you fall for the cancer culture withdrawn support for public figures and companies after they have done or said something considered objectionable or offensive the phenomenon has occurred with both public figures and private clients the term is symbolically applied to incidents both online and off that range from vigilant justice to hostile debate to stalking intimidation and harassment those who embrace the idea of castling seek more than pat apologies now i'm saying sorry ain't good enough they they seek more than just pat apologies attraction when we get part of this cancer culture we want a job we we want we we don't we we don't want you to make any money we want you to be out on the streets we we we want you to be poor and and now start begging this this is what we want none of this stuff agree with scripture and and and i'm gonna just tell y'all be careful how y'all get so associated with this i'm i'm i'm gonna finish up right here i'm gonna just read a few scriptures and i'ma stop right here because i got a timer i got a timer that's why i say i'll be back next week i got more to say but it's not scriptural can we read a few scriptures um matthew 6 verse 9-15 we have a way that we should be responding acting in times like this not like the world because we're not we're we're in the world but we're not of the world we are christians matthew 6 9-15 look at this it says this after this manner therefore pray our father which art in heaven hallowed be thy name thy kingdom come thy will be done in earth as it is in heaven give us this day our daily bread and forgive us our debts as we forgive our debtors and lead us not into temptation but deliver us from evil but thine is the kingdom and the power and the glory forever amen look at this for if ye forgive men their trespasses your heavenly father will also forgive you say don't cancel them forgive them but if you forgive not men their trespasses neither will your father forgive your trespasses so as you canceling you're only hurting yourself because remember hurt people hurt people matthew 18. verse 21 says then peter came to him and said lord how oft shall my brother sin against me and i forgive him till seven times jesus said to him i say not unto thee until seven times but until 70 times 7. first corinthians 13 verse 4 through 6 oh god charity suffers long and is kind charity in this not charity volunteer not itself is not puffed up does not behave itself unseemly seeketh not our own is not easily provoked thinketh no evil rejoice of not in iniquity but rejoices in truth see we got to move to this level and the cancer culture does not allow us to do that can i go back to amen uh just one more uh two more scriptures i want to read go back here to luke 17 verse 1 through 4. i told you that we all are hurt from something we and if we haven't been hurt we're going to be hurt but it's how we respond to it look at what this is what luke 17 tells us verse 1 then said he unto the disciples it is impossible but that offenses will come impossible that means ain't nobody here going to be without it it's how we handle it it's impossible that offenses will come and and i want you to understand that word offenses and that and that that that that that context it's a stumbling block that means all of us can receive stumbling blocks or it also means things that offend it's impossible that but that offenses will come but woe unto him through whom they come if it were better for him that a millstone were hanged about his neck and he cast into the sea praise god that he cast uh that he cast into the sea uh then that he should offend one of these little ones so just let god handle it take heed to yourselves if thy brother trespass against thee rebuke him now y'all got to be careful with that one because you think you need to just go get it straight the bible told me to rebuke you and if he repent forgive him that rebuke in that context just means just have a conversation with him just talk with him straightly charge him and be straight with what you're trying to say don't be going all around just say what you got to say and say it calmly rebuke him and if he repent forgive him so if he repent what you supposed to do no no today cancel him even if he repent we're going to cancel him no forgive him and if he trespass against these seven times in a day seven times in the day turn again to thee saying i repent thou shalt forgive him this is what god is calling us to let me uh line up this last quote from this out in the message i know line that up for me and and this last scripture that i want to read before i read that quote last script is romans 12 verse 1 through 2. i beseech you therefore brethren by the mercies of god that you present your body as a living sacrifice holy acceptable unto god which is your reasonable service and i love this paul gives us the advice and be not conformed to this world but be transformed by the renewing of your mind that you may prove what is that good and acceptable and perfect will of god we all hurt people but we don't have to go around and hurt people it's all how we respond this last quote i want to leave with you today out of i know the prophet says this and why does god let troubles come you're wondering why me you're not the victim you're the victor and why does god let troubles come god harnesses trouble puts bits in its mouth and makes it obey him and those troubles bring us into a closer fellowship with god there had been no rainbow until the flood came but after noah was pressed into that condition that he was in the uh to float 40 days and nights in a storm and the little ark pitching up and down in the water it was after the flood was over that he saw the rainbow for its first time amen the covenant of hope the covenant of promise after he went through the tribulation then he saw the promise amen after he went through the tribulation then he started promise most of us don't want to go through nothing but after you go through the tribulation then you see the promise say that's the way you see the promise after you've gone through the tribulation i like that poem or some must i be carried away and be carried home to heaven on a flower bed of ease while others fought to win the prize and sell through bloody seas we ask for confident peace god gives us the best he could give us and you won't want to know what god's best is for you trials and tribulations oh glory the bet that's better than comfort and peace our comfort is just beyond the river god i have an attitude of gratitude in the midst of my hurt let me see here i'm i'm done for today i'll be back i'll be back i want to tell you this god can turn your pain into purpose he can also turn your pain into praise god can turn your misery into a masterpiece and god can turn your mess into a message he wants to heal you everywhere you hurt we don't have to be like others we can apply the word of god to whatever it is that's that's causing hurt and just listen

it's in the church no matter where it is it is coming but god is how we respond to it help us to bring our burdens lay them at your feet to allow you god to to turn amen this misery lord into uh
