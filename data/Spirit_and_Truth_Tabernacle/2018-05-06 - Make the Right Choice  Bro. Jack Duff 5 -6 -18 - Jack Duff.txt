we have a lot of work a lot of work praise the Lord and the majority of all workers here for his Lord but it's starting to expand so some of you already know we've been invited to come to Paris France she'd already then we got a call I guess last night Friday to come to New York Connecticut Connecticut for another letter so that's actually two separate weddings one in under one in September one sometime in July also so the Lord has really been blessing our business and it's because of the prayers our brothers they get together and pray on on Tuesday I'm praying with y'all in my closing at that time but just watch y'all know I'm not leavin y'all by yourself and then the sisters also praying and I'm just I'm grateful for the prayers of the Saints and for the love that you have for us and we just want to extend that to each and every one of you god bless you [Applause] [Music] [Applause] sorry but I'm sure was blessed I know that was a man God is going so God is God is real good I wanted to say thank the Lord for Macallan st. Louis as this Macallan god bless you so good to have but in mcallen with us a man on today a man also I have a real good friend here few years ago I married this young man and his wife she's here okay she's in the nursery home case so brother at when a man is so good to have him that this is your little brother okay okay so good to have them a man and in the house of the Lord [Applause] a man is precious wags now everyone is is it two kids now as one and one on the way praise the Lord well congratulations amen Edmund and Lucy a man and we just we just appreciate them and this they say they would be here to dance so good to just see them a man in the service of the Lord I got a I got something that I need to do before we go into the word of the Lord on today I need to give you all a quick update a man on on our pledges and that's just a PowerPoint slide it's already I think I already opened up this call of building front update and I just wanted to give you all a quick update and then we will go right into the word at the beginning of the year that we had our meeting and we discussed and voted that we would start you know pledging three years of pledge each person was going to pledge $3,000 each towards the building fund and you know for the next three years and that would allow us enough money to be able to buy our own place a man and I can't wait for the day that we do that my lord I know a man let's give the Lord praise in advance for what a young doing and you know we were I know that the Jesus is coming soon but Wow Amen while we're waiting on them we might as well be busy doing something for praise the Lord so but I just want to give a quick update to things that we talked about there in the meeting one was this building fun and the other was are offering a man and and you know we we pay a pretty good chunk of change to rent amen this space that's good that we can get up and know where we go in the church and you know and don't have to worry about you know nothing I thank God for that we you know God has been faithful to us for well over 10 or 11 years Amen here and if he continues to be faithful but I know that he uses all of us in order to make this a man what it is so we do appreciate everybody's offering and everything and what we ask is that if we had 35 people give $33 a week towards offering a man that would take care of our offer again a 35 people share the load then it would be no big big you might say 35 people have to give thirty three dollars and 33 dollars for offering that's a lot well you didn't say that to your gas tank you say that to your gas tank and you ain't said it to the cable bill hello somebody there's a lot of other bills in your house that you can say that to but when they come to God oh that's not mine but we'll provide you with everything you've got right now so you know sometimes we got to change our perspective I mean I'm gonna be honest I can't give enough to God I can't give enough right and you know they they they they used to segment son you came because giving the more you give the more he gives to you right and and and I found that there's some truth to that song yes some truth I remember reading a story this man he told the Lord he had a car and he actually gave his car just somebody else he ended up with no car and he gave his car to somebody else and he went back in the house they pray and I say Lord I think I finally did it I I think I out gave you I beat you Lord and I is there okay said yeah just get my car I got nothing that Lord so I think I did it and then I got a call as they passed I got a helicopter that I want to give you and when it went when he heard that it's okay Lord you got man we went from a cop to helicopter you came because given please but uh you know I just wanted to if you would just hit next on that for me please this is just a brief update you might have to just hit that light switch there for me real quick just just so that you all know our goal for this year for 2018 our goal was to raise a hundred and five thousand so far pledged you know as far as what came in on the forms that were pledged was forty seven thousand three hundred twenty-five dollars was pledged and and received year-to-date is nine thousand one hundred thirty eight dollars a 30-cent received year-to-date so we started out I think the first month by a thousand and then the next month we got about another five thousand in last month there was another twenty nine hundred that came man so together we have a nine thousand one hundred thirty-eight dollars that has been given best as of April 30th all right as of April 30th and and then you know I told you early in the year we had to do a transfer from our building for him to our offering to cover our expenses and so that leaves us with a net of eight thousand seven hundred thirty eight dollars and thirty cents the one good I mean it's a bunch of good things never won it but one thing I want to point out is that since I told y'all about that transfer we haven't done it again I thank God for that thank God for that and and the other blessing that I see here is that we already as far as what was pledged we already got 10% actually it's over 10% it's actually 10 percent of this pretty much this goal right here has already come in so I'm grateful for that too God is daughters goddess goddess and man God is good so we're gonna keep moving forward in Jesus name and I want to thank all of you all for a man participating and amen and those that haven't given a form back we have some out there you can turn on that light and take that down for me we have a form here on the as you're going down if you'd like to be a part of this drive for us we greatly amen appreciate it and you know just submit it back and we will we will go from there I recently just shared a quick testimony a man both me and my wife we took the pledge and we were you know we were like how we gonna get the money three thousand dollars what we gonna get that from each not together each so we're gonna get that from actually well as the law to provide the lord of providing them so we don't you know we don't know what the Lord gonna do but he'll he'll provide I want to give the three thousand dollars and I want I want to want me to be faithful and so recently I I knew that I I did some work last year and these are people that I didn't work for thee they actually owed me twenty-seven hundred dollars and said that they were not gonna pay it and I said oh wow I did the work and I'm not gonna get paid wow that's that's rough and say no we're not gonna pay it that's all so I couldn't our guess is there anything I could do to come before your board and just talk to the boss and no no no they not gonna pay him Wow okay so I took that and I put it on Malachi chapter 3 where he said he'll rebuke the Devourer for my scene I said am i praying about it put it there and I just let it let God have it right and and I held on to it for about a year so you know at the end of the year last year send a quick email just asking him to reconsider you know what they opening and so I didn't hear anything back in one day I went to the mailbox and the mailbox there's a check for 750 dollars I said wow they are they reconsidered you know and they said hey we did reconsider and we're gonna pay this off in installments to you and hopefully you'll receive this first installment of 750 I've responded back so yes I certainly receive it I'm grateful for it and uh and I'll just patiently wait for the rest of it thank you so much so you know I just left it like that and I took that 750 and I gave it towards the building fund a man and and so after after I took the 750 gave it towards the building fund about a month later I go to the same mailbox unexpectedly and here's another check for $2,000 I say Lord they just paid off you know my dad and I owe I owe 3,000 towards the building fund it just gave me 20 750 now you know you know if God gave me twenty seven fifty you know I can I can get two hundred and fifty dollars so by God's grace I paid my three thousand dollars and I'm grateful and now and I'm saying that to say this y'all know y'all pastor don't have a full-time job you know what you know what the pastor's job is right here this way I work at like this my office I'm at work right now right but God has sustained and provided and I'm telling if God can do it for me God can do it for you if if you'll just be faithful be you know just just just just just you know give God your best giving your all watching turn around and bless you in ways that you never thought a minute you could receive blessings so I thank God for you know that the growth that we're making every month is positive is positive positive so thank you all so much and for your giving and we're gonna keep pressing on believing for our own place amen our own place we don't have that in Jesus name a man a man I received that so don't and please don't forget you know the that's we got there's three forms are given there is tithing there's offering and then there's building from a man special offering and you know the special offering only comes at different seasons that don't happen all the time but when when God calls us into that then we step into that with you know not what I found in my lifetime it you might only experience that maybe once or twice in your lifetime but when God calls you to a step into it everything you got and watch them bless you beyond your expectations a man so praise the

some cookies on lower shelf this morning so they can they can give so we want to read from through to tirana me chapter 30 a man Deuteronomy chapter 30 and let's just stand and we'll read from there and I will go from there just something the Lord just kind of dropped them a spirit and I learned not to wrestle with God a man just just let him be God so Deuteronomy chapter 30 we're gonna start reading at verse 11 praise the Lord Amen so Deuteronomy chapter 30 verse 11 says for this commandment which I command thee this day it is not hidden from the neither is it far off it is not in heaven that thou should have stayed go up for us to heaven and bring it unto us that we may hear it and do it neither is it beyond the sea that thou should have say who shall go over the sea for us and bring it unto us that we may hear it and do it but the word is very nice unto thee that means it's very close to you the very the word is very nice to thee in thy mouth and in thy heart that thou mayest do it's a man see I have set before thee this day life and good and death and evil and that I command thee this day to love the Lord thy God to walk in his ways and to keep his Commandments and his statutes and his judgments that thou may live and multiply and the LORD thy God shall bless thee in the land whither thou goest to possess it but if thine heart turn away so that thou will not hear but shall be drawn away and worship other gods and serve them I denounced unto you this day that ye shall surely perish and that ye shall not prolong your days upon the land whither thou passes over Jordan to go to possess it I call heaven and earth to record this day against you that I have set before you life and death blessing and cursing therefore choose life that both thou and thy seed may live that thou mayst love the LORD thy God and that thou mayst obey his voice and and that thou mayest cleave unto him for he is thy life and the length of our days that thou mayest dwell in the land which the Lord swear to that father Abraham to Isaac and to Jacob to give them the Lord our blessing to the reading of his word let's just pray amen the word of the Lord today father we thank you for this opportunity a man to speak your word we thank you for the anointing that has been in the sanctuary today and Lord you have laid just a little thought on my heart today to address our youth and lord I pray that you would use this for your glory that it would strengthen and encourage each one of them Lord that's something to be said to help them in their journey and life and I God we take control over every spirit that's against your spirit and father may may your spirit now take complete control of your every heart and every mind we bind the hands of the enemy that would try to speak to the people while you're trying to speak to the people it's in the name of Jesus that we pray amen and amen god bless you you can be seated a man less some imma start just reading a little quote here for you and then we will go into a man what our thought is for today this is coming out of the sermon first and for life a man thirsting for life look at look at this it says let's take a little picture like let's let's take a little picture like this God the fountain of all life and the locals that went out of God that brood over the earth and he was brooding the word means like mothering or cooing amen brooding is it means like mothering or cooing the first thing is Hebrew the the like the little moist just began to come together and a little flower raised up God said that's good just keep on brooding and the next thing the grass and the vegetation comes up that's beautiful just keep on brooding then the trees came up that's beautiful I said God just keep on brooding the birds flew from the dust wonderful just keep on brooding the animals come from the dust keep on moving and the man come from the dust God brought man up out of the dust of the earth we're told we're made of 16 elements of the earth potash calcium petroleum cosmic like and so forth and if we had been brought to this place by the grace of God we're not with changing amen he's changing the subject we've been brought to this place by the grace of God and we're free more agents to make a choice and if the Holy Spirit that brewed us from the earth and and starts to Amen brooding to our hearts and we accept him and bring back to him how much more is he able to raise us up in the last days when we got a chance to make a choice so it could only be through the brooding of the Holy Spirit that's how life comes is by the Holy Spirit therefore you can only have life by the Holy Spirit that's why Jesus said except a man be born again he can in no wise see the kingdom of God he goes on the state is and the psalmist saying I loving kindness is better than life then I began to think what kind of life was he speaking of that that the loving kindness of the Father was better than life then it come to my mind that there's a way that seemeth like it is life it is a perverted life my god now the devil cannot create nothing God is only creator there is and what is unrighteousness it's righteousness perverted then we notice that there's a perversion of righteousness that makes unrighteousness it's not original that's not right the original is it is right therefore God had no beginning it has no ending and if we become part of God we can no more diving God can die because we got his life in us by the new birth and we're just as eternal as God is eternal we cannot perish jesus said he that heareth my words believeth on him that sent me he that sent me hath eternal life to never come into judgment but has passed from death to life now the statement that that I'm really focusing on there's that we a man we have this chance to make a choice we have the chance to make a choice each one of your young people have a chance to make a choice and so today I want to talk about make the right choice amen make the right choice you have the chance to make a choice but we want to we're talking about making the right choice and as the Prophet was talking about how God was just brooding and just brooding and brooding and and certain things were happening in the earth and then that would be good and insert things here but that would be good you know when the birds come forth that would be good when the plants come forth that would be good you know our life kind of has the same turns there's certain things that happen like maybe when parents bring us a church that is good that is good for the parents to bring you to church but but the purpose of bringing to the church is to put you in an atmosphere that God could actually speak to you amen and then you can begin to have your own personal relationship with the Lord Jesus Christ amen the one that made you you know there's a purpose for your birth right you know there was a purpose that help your parents your mom did not have a miscarriage and now let me also tell you this you are not a mistake I don't care how you got here I don't care what your situation or circumstance is you're not in a state you are a fault that was in God's mind that had to be expressed at this very moment a man you you could not come at any other day but this thing and it seemed like this day is the worst day that any young person could live but God shows for you to live in this hour hallelujah I'd like to say it like this God had more confidence than you than he had in me because he put you here now and he put me in a day ahead of you oh my think about it God got a lot of confidence in you so we want to talk about making the right choice another thing choice is a great thing this is a statement a couple sickness at the Prophet Mason choice is a great thing there's an unwritten law among us of choosing and other good things that you as an individual you have the right to choose right and and the other thing I want you to leave here a man with this mourners that after you've made a choice after you've made a choice it is you and only you that have to live with the results of your decision right the choices that I've made I have to live with my choices amen and you can't run from that you have to embrace that you have to accept that you have to live with that the other thing I want to tell you that the choices that you young people are making right now are the choices that will impact not only you for your future but your children the choices that you're making right now you know when your parents made a choice to bring you to this church they knew it would have an impact in your life we're down the line so the choices that you make now one day will have an impact on those that you bring forth into this earth think about the choice and that's why I want to encourage you please make the right choice make the right choice now let's go on here a little bit a man and let's kind of talk about this there's there's there's some things that a man you can't choose you absolutely cannot choose they just they just given to you a man one of those a man is your genetic makeup you can't decide I know people trying to have all kind of surgeries and stuff nowadays to the change what they look like right there but we talk about the original right you can choose how you look God's just nature the way that he made you and I want to tell you that you are specifically designed by Almighty God's hand crafted right no matter what subject your genetic make that you are handcrafted you have made the way God want you to be late and you need to take joy in that because God don't make junk and they all start don't make mistakes God is a perfect God right you can you can choose your genetic makeup and the other thing is that you can choose how tall you're gonna be a house short you're gonna be you can't choose that hallelujah and then one of the other things you can choose is your family you know you can choose your mama you can choose your daddy you can choose anything that God gave you the ones that he gave you because he knew there was purpose behind that now sometimes you get to an age where you don't want to hear nothing that mom and daddy got to say all right but you're connected through a blood gene and no matter how often you might want to a man I disassociate yourself with your family you're still connected and I'm gonna tell you go through a season where you want to get you want to disassociate but then it comes another season where you like I love my people it's the seasons change all right so so so you know and parents I want to take you out let let them just go through this season it'll be all right right you can't choose you can't choose your family you can't you can't choose your brother you can't choose your sister God made that choice for you he just puts you inside of that family can we go on a little further hey man there are some things that you can choose when you're making the right choice there are some things you can't choose you can choose your friends but when you choose your friends I want to tell you please make the right choice because the wrong parents could put you in situations that you never thought that you would ever be I remember when I was a young man I had a friend I thought he was a friend I thought he was a real good friend and you know we were we were doing a friendly gesture we were walking him home Aiden and me and my brother we decided to walk this fella home you know we didn't want to walk home by stuff so we'll walk your home and me and my brother walk back you know by you know together and as we walk in this fella picks up a rock out the side of the other side of the road and we look what are you gonna do the rock and before you know he to launch the rock at a car and now he hit that car they was driving at a terrific speed he hit that car and you know how people love their cause right so this he hit the car and when he hit the car that car turn and whipped around and start coming after the non-sena this man just put us in trouble when he get home right where he probably they go me and my brother gonna be out here walking where they hit no clock but we not get in trouble for what he did choose your friends wisely and and let me tell you something else about your friendship if you got a friend that always agree with you that's probably not a friend if they always agree with you if y'all I had no disagreements because see your friendship is tested when you have disagreements when you have trials when you have things that you know make you don't want to talk to each other on the phone no more but your friendship is tested and when you can pick up the phone and still costs that you know what she was right I was wrong that's true friendship if you ain't got friends like that don't worry God would give you some just like that so you can choose your friends you know what you know another thing as you get older now right now you don't have this choice your parents made this choice for you your parents they say now if you live in this house you don't go to your gonna you're gonna do not go to church when we go to church and your parents decide what church they gonna go to well when you get older you can actually choose what church you want to go to can I tell you something make the right choice because every church is not talking about your soul and every Church is not concerned about your soul so make the right choice when you choose to church praise our Lord and man how am i Louie amen you know sometimes we choose with with ulterior motives right you know I go to church well why did you choose that church well because they do this because we drink coffee we do this we do well what about your soul alright what about your soul there the other thing is is sometimes we do that because we're trying to get away from something sometimes you need to face it don't run from it facing it's better to face it hallelujah so you can choose your you can choose your church one day you know one of your young people and I mean you all desire trust that you desire to have a spouse you'll get a chance to choose your spouse you have to live with your choice Amen you you you have the ability to choose to say yes or no to trouble right you can decide whether you're gonna get in trouble not get in trouble you can say yes or no you have that you have the ability to choose whether you don't serve God or not serve Him you also have the ability to choose to follow God's Word or not follow it right these are choices that you can make amen you're old enough to make those types of choices now choosing again as something that has been part of a man human it's just been a month from the days of Adam and Eve that the power of choice has been here right and and God gave them a choice in the Garden of Eden and that that power of choice today you have the same choice to choose good or evil this your choice it's not it's not mama nobody made you do it it's your choice and all I'm telling you this morning make the right choice now when Adam and Eve they had the choice gone home saying I don't even the tree of knowledge of good and evil evil tree of life you know you eat it at right tree of life you'll live forever but the day that you eat of the tree of knowledge good and evil that day you'll die right and they made the choice they made a conscious choice that they would eat of the tree of knowledge Knievel and not that not that they physically died on that day but that time sitting in right and they would not be able to live forever it might have took I don't know how nine hundred years later but they eventually died and that death came in because somebody made a choice and they made the wrong choice and when they made the wrong choice we all suffer from that choice listen let me tell you something either people can benefit from your choice or people gonna suffer from it make the right choice Abraham chose to leave the land of error and dwell in the plains of Mamre while he was there you know leaving the land of her he took his his nephew lot with him and and they got to a spot where there was just oh my just so much confrontation and conflict going on over the land that they were dwelling in so so Abraham told a lot said now look I tell you what you choose where you want to live and I you take you take you take whatever you want and then I take whatever is left over and brother madam said that's the Christian attitude always give your brother the best she let him choose and lot chose now I want to tell you something lot chose to take this land he look down a multi-city say boy look at that the city lights just look so good to live and they went walking amongst the city lights and when they got down there amongst the city lights a man he didn't realize that later on that would impact his check his children and impact his wife because when they got down there months of city lights when God was trying to pull them out of the stand that was there in that place God tried to pull him out his wife she had come been so attached to it that it was hard for her to leave and and and the angel said now when you go down and on turn don't turn and look back you turn you you keep going on pulling you out for a reason but they turn and they look back and she looked back and when she looked back she turned into a pillar of salt against what she made the wrong choice lot didn't realize that was going to come later on you don't realize sometimes the choices that you make now how they're gonna impact you later let me tell you something always choose right even when it's hard to choose right choose it it'll work out in the end can I go a little further another choice a man Ruth chose to go with Naomi and you know Ruth Ruth had to leave some stuff Ruth had to leave her comfort zone Ruth had to leave her family Ruth had to leave a number of things but she said you know what I'm choosing to go with you Naomi I'm gonna I said you're God gonna be my god you're people gonna be my people and no matter how much I'm criticized but I know I'm not I'm not an Israelite I don't care nothing about it I'm choosing to go with you because she made the right choice god bless Ruth to Mary bue ass and that Union brought forth a menace son old bands over it brought forth another son Jesse Jesse brought work brought forth brought forth a couple sons but the last one who happened to be the greatest King that ever lived in Israel David all because one woman made the right choice but it didn't stop with David you know in that same lineage is recorded that Jesus Christ was born out of that same lineage because Ruth made the right choice I think she's happy to live with her decision Moses let's read this in the Bible Moses in Hebrews 11 23 through 26 Moses made a choice see every generation every person is given the ability to make choices young people my encouragement to use and make the right choice in my generation I had to choose whether I was going to serve God or not serve Him I had to make that choice see it got I moved from a man mamama having to make me go to church to me wanting to go on my own even as a young man listen well Hebrews 11 verse 23 by faith of Moses when he was born was hid three months of his parents because they saw he was a proper child and they were they were not afraid of the Kings commandment by faith Moses when he was come to years refused to be called the son of Pharaoh's daughter Moses had it made y'all Moses had it made Moses was living in the house of Pharaoh and man he didn't have to worry about nothing can you imagine maybe Moses just sitting there he got servants all around him people ran when he get when he get a little thirsty somebody bring him something to drink he say lemonade they come with lemonade all right this ain't got enough ice somebody come with some ice all right whatever Moses worn it that's what Moses had because he was now considered the son of Pharaoh the son I mean he was the son of the leader of the nation but one day Moses made a choice it was probably the most difficult choice that he ever could make Moses made a choice to leave that to actually walk away from all attacked I mean not only was Moses a man the stomach Pharaoh Moses was in line to be the next Pharaoh but he made a choice that he will leave that and let's look at this let's look at this a man according to scripture verse 24 says by faith Moses when he was come to years refused to be called the son of Pharaoh's daughter choosing rather to suffer affliction with the people of God than to enjoy the pleasures of sin for Caesar now I need to tell me this just stop there just for a second sin is pleasurable now you you if you all have not come to this yet some of you all probably have there's some of you young people that the devil will enter is what will entice you with all kind of stuff some of y'all might might just struggle with lion some might struggle with you know I remember when I was young I had another friend see you gotta choose your friends wisely I had a friend I had a friend we went to the store and as we're in the store you know comic books with big things back in that day and and and this friend reached over grabbed the little book and stuck it in a jacket pocket and and I'm like no I never have done that like that I'm not used to this type of stuff and I'm not gonna do it all right ain't nothing just just grab ones and no no I'm not doing it now this friend by me being associated with them it was absolutely possible for me to actually get you know get pin with that the penalty the same way that they got there because does not not now is gonna be hard to explain to the police officer it's hard to explain to the judge that I just met this person I mean you know you know I've some y'all got friends or in social media you just met them and that is your best man hallelujah right and they made a ledger to do something and you gotta realize Satan wants to give you friends just like God wants to give you friends but the ones that God want to give you you gotta wait on him you get a little bit too lonely Satan will surprise you with some friends that you never thought you could have and they will pin some stuff on you that you never Oh Lord I thought these were friends be careful who you choose to be friends with and can I tell you something else it's okay to be by yourself until God give you a free can I say that again it's it's perfectly okay to stand alone until God give you a friend Moses here you know I was standing this that some of you all I got I got different age groups here some of y'all will be tempted in all kind of areas in your life some of y'all at the age where you know everybody around you got a boyfriend or girlfriend so you tempted to just do whatever you want to do to get a boyfriend or girlfriend make the right choice some of y'all might get tempted with drugs or alcohol somebody might present to you now and I'll tell you this you know and in my situation because we all get whatever it dis gets thrown in all of us ain't no ain't no sense in lying and Stanley don't happen but in my situation it was family members that introduced me to things like that and you got to make the right choice whatever it is always choose right see that that's why I read that scripture I said before you today life and death and and notice what God sent God actually told you what to do I'm set before you life and death and what God say choose life he's telling you what choice to me just if you wanted if you wanted to be if you want things to be easy choose life look at it verse 25 again choose a rather subtle fiction with the people of God than to enjoy the pleasures of sin for seasoned esteeming the reproach of Christ greater riches than the treasures in Egypt for he had respect unto the recompense of the reward by faith he forsook Egypt not fearing the wrath of the King for he endured as seeing him who is invisible a man Moses had the ability to make a choice I mean here's a man that had he had Egypt in his in his possession but he chose to leave what he had in Egypt and to follow God and the joint God's people you know what I had to come to that same does season one day when I when I chose look I'm gonna serve the Lord I'm not going to go you know the way a popular ping and I have friends that didn't go to church when I was coming up I remember lord have mercy we bi playing back a football and y'all know in the front of y'all houses they have weird mailboxes you just got this one little strip of grass just about this about this wide from here to here just this one strip of grass and then this was the street so we played football in the street and and and the rule was touched in the street tackle in the grass now when I go back and I look at how small that patch of grass is I think myself what in the world were we doing and we can't wait to get somebody in the grass right and we push them from the street into the grass so we can try to tackle them sometime they fall in the street but she was in the grass so that's the way the devil want to do you that's the way the devil want to do you here push in and push in to places that you never thought you'd go when we used to play games like that and I remember the boys want to play we have to you know you couldn't do it too much of that during the during the week because the storm was going down and some of y'all don't have that rule but in my house when Oh Lord yeah y'all ever heard a streetlight rule and when if a streetlight was coming out and Sue sure you know you know what that meant you better get on home don't let my daddy catch you outside with me street lights on and sometimes you know depending on what time of year sometimes a street lights came on little early might be 6:30 street lights on right then when the Sun you know things were changed in it you know it get a little later in the day and things like that so you might be able to play at night but we used to do most of our playing on the weekends so I remember Sunday I was our thing our parents they made the choice for us if you gonna go to church you live in this house you go into Church and lord have mercy we go to church and and soon as churches over we couldn't wait to get out there and start playing some ball with the kids but back in those days we had church twice on Sunday Sunday morning and Sunday night and and the rule was you going to church on Sunday it wasn't which service there was both services we got church on Sunday you go on the church so so you know as we were we would we went we would go out then we played with the guys we get out there and me and my brother know we know for a fact that we can't stay here and hang with these guys because you know it's a certain time that we got the you you learn how to tell time quick sometime we got to break away from this I don't care I could be on my way to touchdown might as well drop it cuz I gotta go home fellas you know what when I was young I hated living like that I hated it but today I'm so grateful that my parents instilled that in me and shake me and mold me into that type of man because it made me make a different decision when it was a time to make those decisions sometimes you have to force ate some stuff that you're involved with in order to follow Christ but in making the right choice I can I can guarantee you this morning I can guarantee you that you'll never regret the decision you make to follow him let's look at this other gentleman that was also presented a choice you you all have Moses had a choice but there's another man here in Scripture I like to pick up his story he's in Luke 18 actually you know what he's also found in Matthew 19 let's pick him up in Matthew 19 and and and The Book of Luke Jesus tells of this saying man that made a he made the wrong choice Matthew 19 verse 16 this man his name the action doesn't have a name he just has a title and his title and scriptures he's tied up the rich young ruler and look at this this this man if I could just put it this way this this man one day came to church just like you're in church and this man had the ability to make a choice while he was in church but he he made the wrong choice look at this says behold one came and said unto him good master what good thing shall I do that I may have eternal life and he said unto him why I call this that'll be good there is none good but one that is God but if thou will enter into life keep the commandments that mean follow the Word of God right he said that I am which Jesus and he said on him which say like which Commandments you're talking about Jesus said thou should not thou shalt do no murder thou shalt not commit adultery thou shalt not steal thou shalt not bear false witness you know those Commandments that he's giving us this year man you know when you even those of you that will get into a man relationships and everything like that you still got choices that you gotta make after your marriage you got the choice to make to keep your vows you can choose to keep them or not keep them but it's a choice that you make right you know and understand that when we choose you know if we choose not to keep our vows there are repercussions that come from that choice and when we choose to keep them there's also some positive repercussions that comes from that choice see so let's go and says thou shalt not steal thou shalt not bear false witness don't lie about people right tellin things that's not true about him say honor thy father and thy mother and thou shalt love thy neighbor as thyself so Jesus giving him Commandments that he's supposed to follow and you know even today we forget some of these Commandments amen and can I just put it this way you know oftentimes and I know we got some damn - I know we got some dads that don't even deserve no honor but is there are some fathers that do deserve honor and we need to learn how to give them their due respect cuz they didn't say just honor mama it said honor your father and your mother you know how young people get I can talk better than my mama Oh Lord yeah I know I know that you know brother branham say here's what happened in your life you're born you're connected to mama through that umbilical cord and everything like them you're born and and there's just there's just an automatic attachment there and mama takes you she's the first one to nurture you and she's the first one to teach you she's the first one to do this and that and she's raising you and doing all kind of things but uh but you know at some point in time mom might have to kind of push you off a little bit too Danny because daddy comes with a different perspective right he has certain wisdom that he brings from some of the things that he went through in life and he's got he's going to he's going to give that to you if you'll accept it right and then you know after you say say after it goes through Mama and Daddy to the event you say you get a teacher and that teacher actually starts pouring things into you and you know and you take that teacher from elementary school all the way up through college you have a teacher somebody giving you something you say but after you finish with all that who do you turn to because you got to have somebody else to lead you who do you turn to then and the kids that were sitting there that day and that serve to say okay we turn on we turn to Christ he said that's it that's the purp that's the right choice when you turn you to start allowing the Lord Jesus to lead you and to guide you and direct you now you've made the right choice let me go a little further let's look at this man in Scripture verse 19 says honor thy father and thy mother and thou shalt love thy neighbor as thyself the young man said to him all these things have I kept from my youth up what lack I yet he said I've been following the commandments I'm doing all that but what's the one thing I'm lacking jesus said unto him if thou will be perfect go and sell that thou hast and give to the poor and thou shalt have treasure in heaven and come and follow me so now he had a choice to me whether he was going to obey God's Word by selling everything he had give to the poor and then come and follow him now look at this verse 22 we see the man's choice it says but when the young man heard that singing he went away sorrowful for he had great possessions now I want to stop there now and what we get here is this man actually made this choice that he was not going to do what Jesus asked him to do he turned the opportunity to follow Christ down and I want you to I want you to I want to read something to you because after this man turned the opportunity to follow Christ down I want to tell you according to scripture the man got richer he actually made more money and he ever made in his life after he rejected Christ why do you think the devil wanted to want to set them up like that the devil tricked you and your finances and trick you and you know and your accomplishments and all these other things and and make you feel like you've accomplished something you actually missed out on the greatest thing that you could ever get and that was eternal life oh Jesus I want to read something to you this is out of the message investments says this rich young man said now there's something for you businessmen and I have to close notice now you'll let this thing deep in your hearts by rejecting Jesus it never stopped his increase of goods he continued on let's follow him a while down through the Bible his flow of goods got greater and because your business picks up a little bit don't you never think that all the time God's blessing the wicked prosper the wicked prosper you know he says this man got he got greater and he got to a place to her he was so great to all of his bars bursting almost he had to build new ones now he thought he had done the right thing by turning down Jesus and not making an investment in him he done the right thing because in the worldly possessions I'm going to say something now in worldly possessions he thought he'd done the right thing because he had prospered and that's what our denominations think because they organize themselves and their groups become millionaires and billionaires they feel that they are it then the Bible say there aren't rich and increased in goods to this age but don't know that your neck it miserable for wretched blind and don't even know it what a miserable condition men and brethren don't make an investment in something like that it's bound to perish while I'm not making investment and something that's proved down through that through the Bible and you know the text that I got written here we could be here tonight still on these texts proving through the Bible those who made that and and and and who turned it down I'm showing you a real investment to make put your life your time your money your talent put everything you got in Christ God guaranteed it God guaranteed it to us by raising him up again will rise in the last days he promised it what more could you look forward to tell me any investment you can make with pay off like that this young man he he turned when he walked away from Jesus and and this is this is what Luke was actually telling us he actually got his barns got so big he said you know what I'm done I'm done Teddy spawns town I'm gonna make myself some bigger barns because I got so much stuff I can't accumulate at all well he got he got Richard he got it got better but also in the Book of Luke it tells the same man that got rich that rejected Jesus the other thing happened to them the Bible says that in hell he lifted up his eyes you know why because he made the wrong choice he had an opportunity to make the right choice but this day he chose to make the wrong choice now you know I felt compelled in my spirit just kind of stopped i got young people at different phases of life some of them say man when i get 18 when i get 18 when you get 18 make the right choice sometimes I want when I get 21 when you get 21 make the right choice right you know we feel we you know that there's so many things that we actually feel that we need to do that we need to experience as young people you know I got to do this and I got Satan is the one that puts that before you and and and you know what second job is he want to get you out on a limb and when you're out on the limb he gonna cut the limb off on you that's the way the devil is who would serve a boss that loves give his people sickness and disease and you know and just anything negative that he can find that's what he wants to put on you right don't don't don't don't make the choice to follow Satan make the choice to follow God even when it hurts send me I got some relationship y'all got to get out of send me I got some friendships that y'all gonna have to let go of you know and you let me tell you love another little secret that I I did when I was younger so Bible say honor your father and your mother well my momma was saved y'all know what that mean my momma was saved Holy Ghost feel saved and see kids can watch these things they see parents and they can see who they can get away with what they know how to rightly divide my mama man she come home from work and she'd go get in the van and pray we knew that but that was a spot she's been a praying and we'd be in there taking on forks and knives just banging them on the table but man we hungry Mama's in that prayer and you learn to respect mama and her prayer time if my dad are respected my mama in her prayer time so you know we you know we learned that so I do never see daddy praying like mama so since I didn't see that I started as an opportunity for a little weakness there are certain things that would come up and I would want to be a part of it one of those was the prom now mama me asking her to go to the prom I know what the answer gonna be so since I already know what the answer gonna be guess what I am NOT going to ask mom but my daddy but daddy uh he never made no statement about the problem so imma imma just imma go with this for him so I went over there and I got with Daddy and daddy can I go can I go can I go can I go and dad to start acting like he was sleep he was just laying on the couch sleep I'm like that I don't told these people that I'm coming to this problem and dad I you know dad dad what you got that what you got so finally dad said okay you can go son say dad now you know I ain't got no money I was in eighth grade and you know I ain't got no money that here starting to go ten dollars not looked at that ten dollars the same way you look at ten dollars a day ten dollars ain't gonna buy me nothing and I'm talk about taking out this is a date so I went to the problem with a hurt spirit ain't got no money in my pocket and and the people around and some of my friends could tell it's a Jackie alright so yeah I'm alright man I'm all right Jackie sure so yeah man so one of the guys pulled me to the side and said Jack man what's going on man you hit the problem innocent man look man I got I got ten dollars man I can't take this young lady out to eat man I got $10 $10 it's at us minute don't worry I came by myself I got $50 y'all can eat on me problem solved and the way I'm Phil is they won't even awake they made one I thought that thing was settled and at the end of the problem and say we're going to wags I said wags okay yeah let's go well I'm good I absolutely forgot I was so caught up in God making away but I went to wags and in the front booth before you can even get through the restaurant all of the church people were sitting in the front beef booth they have went to church that night I was at the prom so here they coming from church with their church clothes on I'm coming in this is a very uncomfortable position and I walk in these like Jack come on instant no I can't go in there Jack what's the Madison no y'all don't understand okay it's not okay come on so I walk on through and and you know they they don't say hello at our church god bless you brother Jack and you talk about shaking I'm like oh no I mean I'm just busted god bless you brother Jack oh this said another word that's all they had to say that's all they had to say and I went on back then to that table I couldn't eat I couldn't do nothing I was ready for the night to be over with God made a way for all right he made a way for me to feel something that I never want to feel again conviction you know what that night I made the wrong choice but since that night I'm making the choices I'm oh how would y'all like to feel if y'all went to the prom went out to eat and I was sitting in the restaurant god bless you especially after hearing a sermon like this and I just see you made the right choice young ladies there are many young ladies that leave home going to the prom and don't come back the same way they left and it's not because we're trying to take fun from you but we sold we certainly know how the devil will try to set you up and put you in a place that you never thought that you would be and you have to make some compromise and decisions don't do that to yourself remember I said this young man he made a choice one day he left her sorry I'm listening to that and this was Jesus preaching I ain't listening to that and you know what he got richer he actually increased in goods but one day the Bible said that his uh when he died in hell he lifted up his ass so you need to think about the choice make the right choice let me go on finish this this descriptor here Matthew 19 verse 23 says then said Jesus sometimes disciples very loud to him to you that a rich man shall hardly enter into the kingdom of heaven and again I said to you it is easier for a camel to go through the eye of a needle than for rich men enter into the kingdom of God when his disciples heard it they were exceeding amazed saying who then can be saved but Jesus beheld them and said unto them with man this is impossible but with God all things are possible let me read one last quote here for you and this is out of the message by faith Moses my heart a man is two young people you you you all are presented with the ability to make the choice your free moral agents your parents can't make you all your life you're gonna have to make your own decisions at some point in time you have to live with those decisions and my encouragement I'm putting life and I'm and death before you please choose life make the right choice look at this by faith Moses it says there there's a choosing and we choose for ourselves we choose something that's for our own good but Moses chose the afflictions and the disgrace that he might walk with the people of God think of it now listen choose the afflictions of the people of God and counted it a greater treasure for he endorsed seeing him who was invisible now a lot one time had to make a choice and and it may be this morning that there be men and women sitting here that'll make your final choice you are today what you are because several years ago you chose to be what you are now I want to say that again you are today what you are because several years ago you chose to be what you are now see what what he says that tomorrow whatever you become tomorrow it'll be because of the choice that you made today go on it says and you choose now will determine what you'll be five years from and what you choose now will determine what you'll be five years from today five years from today you may be a missionary five years from today you may be a renowned Christian or five years from today you may be in hell because you made the wrong decision there's a lot of folk that start out in church in hell right now because they make their own choice five years from the day you may be cleaning spittoons and a barroom that that is that is a that's ashtrays alright cleanest Patil's in a barroom five years for a day you may be a prostitute on the street or you may be a man a woman that's a credit to any society because of your choice for Christ five years from the day you may be in glory going in the rap because you made your choice today but you've got to choose and don't look at what you see choose what you see by faith that's the only thing that will count is what you choose by faith lot as he had to make a choice Abraham give a lot his choice and God gives you your choice choose you this day whom will serve in the Garden of Eden there was a tree of knowledge and a tree of life man was given the privilege to choose either one he desired and so is it today you're given your privilege as a free moral agent to choose whatever you want to choose my advice is don't look at the modern things around you and the popularity and the glamour that you could be but choose rather by faith him that give the promise that someday he will come and he will write in all wrongs and will give you eternal life and raise you up no matter if you take the despised way but the Lord few make that choice it's not easy to live the Christian life that you are living it's not easy a man to be called church boy a church girl it's not easy I understand that but it's a choice that you have to make that you know what this is the right life to live and the life that these others are living is the one that I don't want to live you have to make that choice let me go on if there is trouble in in in the land in the hand if there's trouble in the land if there's trouble in the church troubles in the church if there's trouble in the home no matter where it is make your choice by faith I'll serve God I'll humbled my heart and his presence I'll take the way with God's children I see them despised and rejected and drove out and made fun of but I'll still take my post of duty I'll stay right by them and when they cry I'll cry with them and when they're when their sorrow I shall start with them they the way they live I'll live like Norma's and Ruth Ruth sent an ailment your ways will be my ways my ways will be your ways where you live I'll live where you go outgo that God the God that you serve will be my god take that choice though it pulls the very skin of your conscience of thinking that you're somebody skin your stuff down and take your way with the Lord's despise for you and stay lawyer on the field of service and at the post of duty young people I had to take this opportunity today just to encourage you make the right choice you know someday this world is gonna come to an end and we'll stand before God and we stand before God those of you that decided that you know what just like the rich young ruler I'm gonna reject what Christ was saying to me and I'm gonna do it my way those of you that decide that you know you already know what the end result was for the rich young ruler that would be your end result as well but those of you that say you know what I got everything handed to me I mean I could be this I could be that but I'm gonna choose to suck the afflictions with the people got like Moses did and watch what God does for you see when you stand on the other side and God judges us all this moment this day will be replayed it's been recorded and now it can be replayed not just on YouTube but in heaven and I want to tell you I call heaven and earth against you today you can choose life or death but God encourages you choose life choose life choose life let's break musicians don't worry just stay where you're at father just feeling led by your spirit to just take a moment and deal with the lamps each one here has been given the ability to make a choice they choose right they choose wrong so many so many things that that they know are right maybe language that they might use they know they wouldn't use it at home but yet the enemy is there just doing everything bombard them with it every day yeah and then they choose to just live like some of the other people and say some of the words that the other safe some are God in a place where maybe somebody's trying to pressure them into sexual activity they know what's right and what's wrong and God they they have to make choices on on everyday basis somebody might try to press them to to get them involved in drugs and alcohol so many other things out there that they could be involved in somebody has to make a choice but today Lord they've been given the choice they've been given an opportunity to follow Christ just the same way that rich young ruler was given an opportunity to follow Christ I pray that they won't reject this I pray that they would receive it I also pray that some today would come to that that spot where they make the right choice if they're not serving if they're not following if they're not living for you that today would be the day that they say you know what I made I made the right choice I'm following Jesus Lord I can only do what I can do just to try to reach them and whatever way I can and I pray that not one would be lost there's a struggle going on the enemy pulling left him right and Lord just doing everything he can to disrupt the lives of young people wants to destroy him that's what the Bible said he'd come to kill steal and destroy and got my prayer is that you will show them that you come to give them life and they give life more abundantly help them to choose you for you are not just the right choice but you're the only choice god I pray the thing would come to that while every head is foul there's a young person here today that has heard the voice of the Lord to speak to you about making the right choice and say brother Jack I have not made the right choices in the past but today I want to make the right choice I want to follow Jesus I really want to follow him if that's you and God has spoke to your heart just lift your hand right where you are and I'm not going to embarrass you if you say I want to be one of those that follow Christ because I haven't done it God knows every heart in this place and God gives us opportunity after opportunity to follow him today is another chance that's been given to you one day is going to be the last chance if the day the Lord has spoke to your heart as a brother Jack I'm not doing what I'm supposed to be doing I'm not following the way that I should be following I want you to pray for me today just lift your hand that's you just

the the lambs feed him speak to him God has purpose for that I want to tell you something God loves you that he would change everything just to try to get a word to you but it can't force himself and you have to be the one to open up and let him in he asks you today just as he asked that rich young ruler will you follow me will you serve me will you love me if that's you hearing his voice cuz they say the day you hear my voice don't harden your heart if that's you today and you hear his voice I want you to lift your hand in his presence I want to pray for you father your hands right up in this

for those two I thank you God that you could speak to them because Lord you spoke to me you did all kind of things to reach me and I thank you God for reaching me or today I pray that as those hands have going up that they've made the choice to follow you God that you would give them the peace that passeth all understanding their Lord that they would know that every sin would be washed away that you don't hold anything against them and God that you would give them the boldness that they need to be Christians in this generation you called them because they're strong the Bible says that they

thank you Jesus Laurie to God make the right choice you know I was thinking there's a lot of a lot of different people that just out there and in the world one that one guy recently that really made a very bad choice and it affected him sometimes you can make choices and you don't realize the impact that they will have on you some of you all might know him his name was Aaron Hernandez this man was a well-known football player won a couple Super Bowls it was a real I mean one of the top of tight hands you know in football for you know four years and he made a choice to get involved in something with us some smother gentlemen and they went and they actually killed a man you know they killed this man and and he was associated with the whole thing and when they found him guilty he said they said that he would spend the rest of his life in prison and it couldn't handle the choice that he made and that choice caused him to commit suicide and often times we don't realize a man the choices that we make the people that you associate yourself with the people that you get involved with you have no idea how that could lead you down the path that you never thought that you would go you know what it started out as an ascent fine but I want to tell you something you're innocent fun is actually the gates of hell you're innocent fun it's a gates of hell please whatever you do make the right choice brother Solomon if you would come and disclose this out on today made man feel like I've done what the Lord told me to do it man and I leave this now in your hands make the right choice God richly bless you [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] yes Lord before you Lord God being grateful Lord others you would encourage us to choose life father we're so grateful that you've given us a
