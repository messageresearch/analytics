[58:26] with me we have been I've taken a
[58:29] journey through first John to here and
[58:31] we hopefully bring some closure to our
[58:33] thought today while we're getting first
[58:36] John to a man I also just wanted to make
[58:40] mention that um you all were made aware
[58:43] of brother Charlie Torres who passed
[58:46] away there in Tennessee very precious
[58:49] asain of God a man a prisoner of war and
[58:54] he actually passed on Veterans Day amen
[58:57] I think that was a you know just a
[59:00] testimony a mentor who he who he was not
[59:03] only a soldier in the United States Army
[59:06] but also a soldier in the army of the
[59:07] Lord and we thank God God gave him 96
[59:11] years 96 years and he was very healthy
[59:14] for most of those years if he would have
[59:16] walked into this church on fire like he
[59:18] always was she wouldn't have been you
[59:20] wouldn't be able to tell he was 96 years
[59:21] old Amen but he just loved the Lord and
[59:24] what we we weren't able to make the
[59:26] service but for his home going but we
[59:29] did get a card that we wanted to send to
[59:31] his wife and just to encourage her and
[59:34] we'll have the card outside for you at
[59:36] the service if you would just sign and
[59:38] just send her you know just some well
[59:40] wishes let her know that you're praying
[59:41] for her through this time and a man we
[59:44] want to continue to keep that family in
[59:46] our prayers
[59:47] amen here in 1st John chapter 2 verse 15
[59:52] we started with this a man a few weeks
[59:54] ago and will go further in this thought
[59:57] today but the Bible a man tells us love
[1:00:01] not the world neither the things that
[1:00:05] are in the world
[1:00:06] if any man love the world the love of
[1:00:09] the father is not in him and I want to
[1:00:12] go further we were stopping there for
[1:00:14] the last two weeks and we just kind of
[1:00:16] dwelt on that but let's go a little
[1:00:17] further into what John is trying to
[1:00:20] speak to us he says for all that is in
[1:00:22] the world the lust of the flesh and the
[1:00:25] lust of the eyes and the pride of life
[1:00:29] is not of the Father all right so the
[1:00:34] lust of the flesh the lust of the eyes
[1:00:36] and the pride of life is not of the
[1:00:39] Father but is of the world okay and the
[1:00:44] world passeth away and the lust thereof
[1:00:47] but he that doeth the will of God
[1:00:49] abideth forever amen the Lord had a
[1:00:52] blessing to the reading of his word you
[1:00:54] can be seated a man you all join us amen
[1:01:04] we are under we are a faith as being a
[1:01:11] man elevated to believe God for a new
[1:01:14] church in a new school and y'all y'all
[1:01:17] join us not God God is in the
[1:01:19] miracle-working business is that right a
[1:01:20] man and I always kind of share this a
[1:01:23] man we you know we are in here a plaza
[1:01:26] where a lot of churches are together and
[1:01:29] one of the things about you know being
[1:01:31] down here in the corner if you had a
[1:01:33] business it's not many people that would
[1:01:34] find your business in the corner so most
[1:01:36] businesses shut down you know here in
[1:01:38] the corner but churches seem to survive
[1:01:40] right and so so what happens this is a
[1:01:43] landlord he'd like to put them all
[1:01:44] together and then our services bleed
[1:01:46] over into one another and you know we
[1:01:48] just got to deal with it but you know
[1:01:50] I've learned that I rather have I'd
[1:01:52] rather deal with a church then deal with
[1:01:54] a club right so there's some things you
[1:01:57] can just be thankful for a man so you
[1:02:00] all just be praying with us we believe
[1:02:01] in God and a man he's at work right now
[1:02:03] behind the scenes even right now while
[1:02:05] we talk and he's at work so a man we're
[1:02:09] relieving God so it meant just saw just
[1:02:11] bear with us we want to Amen use from
[1:02:13] our subject again today love not the
[1:02:16] world a man love not the world
[1:02:19] we are looking at a couple things here
[1:02:21] you know here John is telling us to love
[1:02:24] not the world neither the things that
[1:02:25] are in the world
[1:02:26] If any man love the world the love of
[1:02:27] the father is not in him and and when we
[1:02:30] when we think about this scripture and
[1:02:31] we compare it to some of the other
[1:02:32] scriptures especially John 3:16 because
[1:02:36] John 3:16 tells us for God so loved the
[1:02:38] world a man that He gave His only
[1:02:41] begotten Son that whosoever believeth in
[1:02:43] him should not perish but have
[1:02:44] everlasting life now when we look at a
[1:02:46] man first john 2:15 with john 3:16 we
[1:02:50] can almost see that there is somewhat of
[1:02:53] a conflict in these scriptures because
[1:02:54] we're being told to love not the world
[1:02:56] but then we're told that god loves the
[1:02:58] world well in order to get clarification
[1:03:00] on that we need to go further in
[1:03:02] scripture and this is where we go to
[1:03:03] hebrews 1 and verse 2 where it says hath
[1:03:07] in these last days spoken unto us by his
[1:03:10] son whom he hath appointed heir of all
[1:03:12] things by whom also he made the world's
[1:03:14] he made the world so a man when we look
[1:03:18] at that now we see that there is there's
[1:03:19] more than just one world that we're
[1:03:21] dealing with and if i could just you
[1:03:23] know just just let you know you're
[1:03:25] living in more than just one world you
[1:03:27] know your your cell phone is operating
[1:03:29] in a different world than what you're
[1:03:31] operating in hallelujah amen
[1:03:34] so here there's also colossians 1:16
[1:03:37] that tells us for by him we're all
[1:03:39] things created that are in heaven and
[1:03:41] that are in the earth visible and
[1:03:43] invisible so there's a visible world
[1:03:46] which you see right now but there's also
[1:03:48] an invisible world right he said whether
[1:03:50] they be Thrones or dominions or
[1:03:52] principalities or powers all things are
[1:03:55] created by him and for him so we want to
[1:03:58] kind understand here that there are
[1:03:59] multiple worlds there's an invisible
[1:04:01] world there's a visible world a man and
[1:04:04] even in the in the invisible world
[1:04:06] there's angels that dwell there there's
[1:04:08] also demons amen that dwell in that
[1:04:11] invisible world and oftentimes we might
[1:04:13] not realize it but we're being pulled
[1:04:15] from one world or the other we're either
[1:04:17] been pulled from heaven or we're being
[1:04:19] pulled from hell and all that's happened
[1:04:21] is we're seeing a manifestation of
[1:04:23] either one of those worlds manifested in
[1:04:25] the world in which we live right now
[1:04:27] where we have these five senses a man
[1:04:29] seat a seer smell
[1:04:31] and all of that you know we're we're
[1:04:34] being controlled by those processes
[1:04:35] we're living in that world but there are
[1:04:37] other worlds all around us and God made
[1:04:39] all of them hallelujah God made the
[1:04:42] devil a man God made the devil now I
[1:04:48] need y'all to understand something bout
[1:04:49] the devil the devil is not equal to God
[1:04:53] never ever never never never think that
[1:04:56] he's not equal because he was made by
[1:04:58] God and he had a purpose for being made
[1:05:00] by God right amen but but God made the
[1:05:03] devil God made the angels God made you
[1:05:05] God made me God made all of these worlds
[1:05:07] and God gets glory from all of it
[1:05:11] Oh hallelujah hallelujah so you know
[1:05:14] where we're talking about so when we
[1:05:15] talk about love not the world we got to
[1:05:17] understand which one to talk about the
[1:05:19] world that God loves is the one that
[1:05:20] you're dwelling in Amen that's the one
[1:05:22] that he died for hallelujah Amen but
[1:05:25] there there's a there's a world even
[1:05:27] even if I if I can also put it this way
[1:05:29] there's a church world that God loves
[1:05:33] and one that God don't like if the Bible
[1:05:39] actually speaks it Amen over there in
[1:05:40] the book of Revelation say he that hath
[1:05:42] an ear let him hear what the spirit
[1:05:43] saith unto the church s not just one
[1:05:46] church but church s so there's a false
[1:05:49] church and there's a true church and
[1:05:51] they both say they worship God and one
[1:05:54] God loves and one God hates it's right
[1:05:58] there in the scripture right so you know
[1:06:00] we don't try to go a little deeper Amen
[1:06:02] here today because if there's a world
[1:06:04] that we're not supposed to love amen and
[1:06:06] that's what John is telling us though
[1:06:07] and when we see the influence of some of
[1:06:10] the things of the world then we know
[1:06:12] which world God don't love because that
[1:06:14] world will never be converted hallelujah
[1:06:17] but you you have the opportunity to be
[1:06:20] converted that's why God loves you in
[1:06:22] the word that you living in God loves
[1:06:24] dance but there's another word that he
[1:06:26] don't love and he's telling us to avoid
[1:06:29] that with everything we can now let's go
[1:06:31] a little deeper here I want to just kind
[1:06:34] of I'm gonna just jump right in if y'all
[1:06:37] don't mind this this world amen this
[1:06:39] word world
[1:06:41] has multiple definitions and one of the
[1:06:44] definition
[1:06:45] is an apt and harmonious agreement or
[1:06:47] Constitution order government and you
[1:06:50] know what we find there's oftentimes in
[1:06:52] in the church world we have the
[1:06:54] government and oh my help us lord that
[1:06:57] the government that you see in church
[1:06:59] world it produces a political system oh
[1:07:03] my it produces a political system that
[1:07:08] God is not in favor of right because
[1:07:11] politics rule not the Spirit of God Oh
[1:07:15] y'all they're gonna talk to me today but
[1:07:17] it's a truth in it hi there oftentimes a
[1:07:20] man in the church world politics will
[1:07:22] rule not God's Spirit amen when God
[1:07:26] wants to lead his people God wants to do
[1:07:28] something a different no no no we got
[1:07:29] that thing program where politics can
[1:07:32] rule and God don't like that I'm gonna
[1:07:35] let you know that's all in scripture we
[1:07:36] can go through it but but but that when
[1:07:38] you look at this definition an act in
[1:07:40] harmonious arrangement or Constitution
[1:07:43] order or government Amen we see that
[1:07:46] worldly system in church in God hates
[1:07:48] them alright another another another
[1:07:50] definition is the ungodly multitude so
[1:07:54] when it says love not the world we're
[1:07:56] not supposed we're not supposed to a man
[1:07:58] feel comfortable hanging with an ungodly
[1:08:03] multitude come on somebody people that
[1:08:07] you know ain't gonna accept your Jesus
[1:08:10] they don't tell you they don't want your
[1:08:12] Jesus and you're still trying to hang
[1:08:15] with them won't you wait to God changed
[1:08:17] a heart before you go hang with them but
[1:08:19] but we're not supposed to wanna hang
[1:08:21] with an ungodly multitude also says the
[1:08:24] whole mass of me and alienated from God
[1:08:27] and therefore hostile to the cause of
[1:08:30] Christ you got somebody like that in
[1:08:32] your life that's hostile to the cause of
[1:08:34] Christ you're supposed to let them go
[1:08:36] amen praise the Lord Amen I'm gonna tell
[1:08:40] you something when you spend so much
[1:08:41] time you up here trying to and somebody
[1:08:43] else down there and you're pulling
[1:08:44] trying to lift them up
[1:08:45] do you realize just based on the
[1:08:47] position that they're in they can
[1:08:48] actually pull you down fast and you can
[1:08:51] pull them up
[1:08:54] a man so you can't hang with everybody
[1:08:58] right you came fellowship with everybody
[1:09:01] it just bottom line because those people
[1:09:04] are designed by Satan to actually pull
[1:09:07] you down you can't love the world or the
[1:09:10] things other world otherwise the love of
[1:09:12] God is not in you can we go further all
[1:09:15] right so this last definition is the one
[1:09:17] that we really want to dwell up with
[1:09:18] dwell on today it's the world affairs
[1:09:21] all right the aggregate of things
[1:09:23] earthly the whole circle of earthly
[1:09:26] goods endowments riches advantages
[1:09:31] pleasures etc which although hollow and
[1:09:35] frail and fleeting they stir desire to
[1:09:38] seduce you from God and our obstacles to
[1:09:41] the cause of Christ now let's look at
[1:09:45] this a little deeper if we can because
[1:09:49] here's what in first John to a man again
[1:09:51] verse 15 16 17 let's read it again love
[1:09:55] not the world neither the things that
[1:09:57] are in the world
[1:09:58] If any man love the world the love of
[1:10:01] the father is not in him and then John
[1:10:05] goes a little further says for all that
[1:10:07] is in the world amen the lust of the
[1:10:11] flesh and the lust of the eyes and the
[1:10:14] pride of life is not of the Father but
[1:10:18] is of the world now let's just try to
[1:10:20] see if we can dig in there a little
[1:10:21] deeper amen on this lust of the flesh
[1:10:23] lust of the eye amen in the pride of
[1:10:27] life now I just went to a commentary
[1:10:30] here Matthew Henry commentary I got some
[1:10:32] definitions that I want to bring to you
[1:10:34] before we go further and he says this
[1:10:36] this lust of the flesh the flesh here
[1:10:38] being distinguished from the eyes and
[1:10:40] the life imports the body say the lust
[1:10:43] of the flesh is subjectively the humour
[1:10:46] and appetite of indulging in fleshly
[1:10:49] pleasures amen
[1:10:51] objectively all those things that excite
[1:10:54] and inflame the pleasure of the flesh
[1:10:56] this lust is usually called luxury
[1:10:59] alright so what we're looking at here is
[1:11:01] this lust of the flesh it's physical
[1:11:03] desire amen we and I'm gonna have to I'm
[1:11:06] gonna have to talk about that
[1:11:07] a man today because uh you know we we
[1:11:10] you know people don't realize it but
[1:11:12] they don't they're falling to the lust
[1:11:13] of the flesh quite often you know stuff
[1:11:16] that we see on TV annoying still lust of
[1:11:18] the flesh can I also say some of the
[1:11:22] music that we choose to listen to it
[1:11:24] annoys the lust of the flesh your flesh
[1:11:27] begin to long for stuff that it's not
[1:11:29] supposed to have hallelujah a man you
[1:11:33] marry what you listen for somebody else
[1:11:35] for huh that but but but you don't
[1:11:39] realize it there's an anointing coming
[1:11:41] from another world that's why you can't
[1:11:44] talk with everybody I remember you know
[1:11:47] uh you know years ago my wife had a
[1:11:49] friend that that she was you know they
[1:11:51] were real good friends
[1:11:52] but you know when my wife got married
[1:11:54] and you know she was thinking about
[1:11:55] married things and and and this one
[1:11:58] friend and this one friend got married
[1:12:00] but but you know her her conversation
[1:12:02] was like well you know what I know my
[1:12:04] husband is cheating so i'ma start
[1:12:05] cheating right and and you know I know
[1:12:09] he doing this so i'ma do that right not
[1:12:11] now if my wife kept entertaining that
[1:12:14] type of conversation
[1:12:15] what type of anointing do you think she
[1:12:17] would have received she would have start
[1:12:20] doubting me well if her husband cheating
[1:12:22] all men are dogs that's what they say Oh
[1:12:25] y'all they gonna talk to me today right
[1:12:28] but all I'm in a dog so now you get this
[1:12:30] anointing on you and you marry and now
[1:12:32] you listening out for somebody else it's
[1:12:34] flesh and realize when you start doing
[1:12:38] that the love of God is not in you hey I
[1:12:42] got to make it plain y'all just forgive
[1:12:44] me for being a plain preacher you know I
[1:12:46] was just wondering you know what kind of
[1:12:48] doctor would you won't write what you
[1:12:51] want a doctor that you know you're going
[1:12:52] to tell them say man I got some stomach
[1:12:54] pain I don't know where this come from I
[1:12:56] mean I've been dealing with this for
[1:12:57] days it's been on a while before I could
[1:12:59] get in here to the office and I got this
[1:13:01] stomach pain and you walk in tell them
[1:13:03] all you know you probably say he'd go to
[1:13:05] aspirin take him and call me in the
[1:13:06] morning now I'm gonna tell you something
[1:13:07] you had a doctor like that you would not
[1:13:09] be returning back to that doctor right I
[1:13:12] mean because he's not really diagnosing
[1:13:14] the issue right he not he not working
[1:13:16] for anything to aspirin and sent me away
[1:13:19] so no no no I'm not going back
[1:13:20] so if you wouldn't want a doctor like
[1:13:22] that why play with preachers get
[1:13:26] yourself a preacher that's going to tell
[1:13:28] you the truth not one that's gonna
[1:13:30] tickle your ears hey hey look look
[1:13:35] there's a time for singing and there's a
[1:13:37] time for preaching hallelujah amen if
[1:13:41] you want me to sing come before service
[1:13:44] but when it's time to preach is time to
[1:13:46] preach and we're going to deal with the
[1:13:48] wine of God when it's time to preach
[1:13:51] come on somebody
[1:13:54] hallelujah not now listen you know that
[1:13:56] this distance thing is this lust of the
[1:13:58] flesh it's dealing with physical
[1:14:00] pleasure another definition when I talk
[1:14:03] about the lust of the eyes and say the
[1:14:04] eyes delighted with treasures riches and
[1:14:08] rich possessions the eyes are delighted
[1:14:12] with treasures riches and rich
[1:14:15] possession are craved by an extravagant
[1:14:18] eye this is the lust of covetousness all
[1:14:22] right so so oftentimes when we get from
[1:14:24] to the lust of the eye and this happens
[1:14:26] all the time when people fall subject to
[1:14:29] this amen they put they job before God
[1:14:32] right they put they put making money
[1:14:35] before God look if God wanted you to
[1:14:38] have it he can just bless you with it
[1:14:40] Oh hallelujah you can tell when people
[1:14:43] fall subject to the lust of the flesh
[1:14:45] you can tell when people fall subject to
[1:14:48] the lust of the eye because the first
[1:14:50] thing a man weight where the first thing
[1:14:53] that if that is impacted by it is their
[1:14:55] attendance in church you know exactly
[1:15:01] when they've been affected by this the
[1:15:04] lust of the flesh will stop people from
[1:15:05] coming to church when people fall in sin
[1:15:08] when they're living in sin they won't
[1:15:12] come to church y'all are gonna talk to
[1:15:14] me huh and then when they're if they're
[1:15:18] not from the same but but maybe they got
[1:15:19] an appetite for for craving to be rich
[1:15:25] ain't no you know look look I'm not I'm
[1:15:27] not preaching against money money
[1:15:29] answereth all things but what the
[1:15:31] problem is the love of money see money
[1:15:34] not Eve
[1:15:34] it's the love of money it's how you go
[1:15:36] about getting it when you got a
[1:15:37] sacrifice got to get the money you got a
[1:15:41] problem
[1:15:42] hallelujah actually money has become
[1:15:45] your gods
[1:15:46] hallelujah and what the word says that
[1:15:48] you can't serve God and Mammon you can't
[1:15:51] serve God and money at the same time all
[1:15:54] right
[1:15:54] I'm going a little further don't worry
[1:15:56] I'm just giving you some highlights
[1:15:57] right now we'll get deep in this and
[1:15:59] we'll show you that not as other than
[1:16:01] the pride of life look at this it's a
[1:16:02] vain mind that craves all the grandeur
[1:16:06] equip it and throw and pump a
[1:16:09] vainglorious life now you know I like
[1:16:12] this you know I don't care what you
[1:16:14] accomplish in this life when you leave
[1:16:17] you will be forgotten it's only a few
[1:16:23] people that's going to remember you they
[1:16:25] sitting next to you right now but in the
[1:16:29] in this world's way ain't nobody I don't
[1:16:32] care what your job in this place is
[1:16:34] today die and see what happens they will
[1:16:42] quickly replace you actually they got
[1:16:47] somebody waiting right now they waiting
[1:16:52] for you to trip up somebody got somebody
[1:16:54] in the wings waiting to replace you and
[1:16:57] you're giving all your life for that God
[1:17:00] don't want you to do that give all your
[1:17:01] life to him and let him use you for his
[1:17:04] glory I don't care how much money you
[1:17:08] earn to come the company they don't
[1:17:11] forget about you once you die hallelujah
[1:17:14] amen it might we might as well just be
[1:17:16] honest so that's why you can't love the
[1:17:17] world of the things of the world and so
[1:17:20] so here this this proud of life is a
[1:17:21] vain mind that craves all the grandeur
[1:17:23] equip each pop of a vainglorious life
[1:17:26] this is ambitious a man this is this is
[1:17:29] ambition and the thirst after honor and
[1:17:31] admiration and praise do you know you
[1:17:33] know that that some people just cannot
[1:17:35] can not a man get off the stage even
[1:17:39] when they retire they have a hard time
[1:17:41] letting go to stage people want to be in
[1:17:44] a place where their name is always being
[1:17:46] called in the public eye
[1:17:48] can I just I'm gonna just call his name
[1:17:49] Dennis Rodman couldn't stay out of
[1:17:51] trouble
[1:17:52] if you all know who he is a basketball
[1:17:55] player since he couldn't play basketball
[1:17:56] no more he kept getting in trouble in
[1:17:58] the things just to get his name in the
[1:18:00] public eye hallelujah and some people
[1:18:04] don't realize that's the pride of life
[1:18:05] and you're not supposed to desire that
[1:18:07] when you desire that it shows that the
[1:18:10] love of God is not there you won't you
[1:18:11] won't vainglory let God lift you up
[1:18:16] hallelujah look at this I'm gonna say
[1:18:19] this is this that they call this this
[1:18:21] proud of life it's a thirst after honor
[1:18:24] and applause this in part is the disease
[1:18:27] of the ear the private life they call it
[1:18:30] the disease of the ear you're just you
[1:18:34] love hearing people call your name you
[1:18:37] love people you mean yeah I mean they
[1:18:38] said this about me they said that about
[1:18:40] and you just longed for more and more of
[1:18:43] it it's the pride of life that got you
[1:18:46] hallelujah when I go to church I get
[1:18:48] repute but when I get out here amongst
[1:18:51] ten people they just love me they don't
[1:18:53] know you I might as well just say it
[1:19:00] let's say saying say it's the ISTE it's
[1:19:03] the disease of the ear
[1:19:06] it must be flattered with admiration and
[1:19:09] praise see the object of these appetites
[1:19:12] must be abandoned and renounce as they
[1:19:16] engage the engrossed affection and
[1:19:18] desire they are not of the Father but of
[1:19:21] the world see the father this allows
[1:19:23] them and the world should keep them to
[1:19:26] itself the lustre appetite to these
[1:19:28] things must be mortified and subdued I'm
[1:19:32] giving you matthew Henry's comments and
[1:19:34] then they must be modified and subdued
[1:19:37] so the indulging of it is not appointed
[1:19:40] by the father but it's insinuated by the
[1:19:43] ensnaring world so when we start looking
[1:19:46] at this remember torian's the world
[1:19:48] visible in a world invisible sometimes
[1:19:50] Satan wants to anoint you to do things
[1:19:52] right
[1:19:53] amen to get you going down a direction
[1:19:56] that's actually gonna pull you further
[1:19:57] from God let's kind of look at this a
[1:19:59] little bit further I want to go deeper
[1:20:01] in this
[1:20:02] this is gonna come out of laodicean
[1:20:03] church age a little quote that I want to
[1:20:05] read a man I'm gonna show you a man a
[1:20:07] little bit how Eve was affected by this
[1:20:10] this lust of the flesh lust of the eye a
[1:20:13] man in pride of life how she failed
[1:20:15] there but then I also want to show you
[1:20:16] how Jesus was also impacted by it but he
[1:20:19] overcame listen let us see in church age
[1:20:22] paragraph 360 says this a quick look at
[1:20:25] those scriptures which involve the Lord
[1:20:28] Jesus overcoming will bring out the
[1:20:31] truth of this proposition and Matthew
[1:20:34] form will go there shortly in Matthew 4
[1:20:36] wherein Jesus is tempted of the devil he
[1:20:39] overcame the personal temptations of
[1:20:41] Satan by the word a man and by the word
[1:20:46] only if you're going to overcome the
[1:20:47] devil in this hour it's going to be by
[1:20:49] the word and by the word only your song
[1:20:51] not gonna get it
[1:20:52] you're gonna need you're gonna need a
[1:20:54] revelation of the Word of God listen by
[1:20:55] the word and by the word only in each of
[1:20:58] the three major trials that correspond
[1:21:02] it exactly to the temptation of the
[1:21:04] Garden of Eden the lust of the flesh the
[1:21:07] lust of the eye and the proud of life
[1:21:10] Jesus overcame by the word he fell to
[1:21:14] the personal temptation of Satan by
[1:21:16] failing to use the word Adam fair and
[1:21:20] direct disobedience to the word but
[1:21:22] Jesus overcame by the word I want to say
[1:21:26] it again Eve fell to the personal
[1:21:28] temptation of Satan by failing to use
[1:21:30] the word Adam fell in direct
[1:21:33] disobedience to the word but Jesus
[1:21:36] overcame by the word and right now let
[1:21:39] me say this that this is the only way to
[1:21:43] be an overcomer
[1:21:44] it is the only way you can know if
[1:21:46] you're overcoming because the word can't
[1:21:49] fail I want to read this about Eva said
[1:21:52] that um that she she she fell here in
[1:21:55] this area of lust of the flesh lust of
[1:21:56] the eyes pride of life now let's look at
[1:21:58] let's look at Eve let's go to Genesis
[1:22:00] chapter 3 let's go here to Genesis
[1:22:03] chapter 3 I want you all to look at this
[1:22:05] now I made a statement last week and I'm
[1:22:07] gonna have to go back and say this again
[1:22:14] first of all a man we have a issue here
[1:22:17] where when we look at just what happened
[1:22:22] in the book of Genesis the churches are
[1:22:24] divided over this even today right even
[1:22:28] today people have no idea what happened
[1:22:31] in the Garden of Eden and we've been
[1:22:33] going to church all our life and we
[1:22:35] still don't know what happened in the
[1:22:37] Garden of Eden at the beginning of the
[1:22:39] Bible now if we can't get the beginning
[1:22:41] of the Bible right how we gonna end up
[1:22:43] right at the end I just need to ask that
[1:22:46] question right we got to ask Christians
[1:22:49] we got to get something that solidifies
[1:22:51] what happened in the Garden of Eden now
[1:22:54] now everybody know Eve got pregnant
[1:22:57] everybody know that she had she had she
[1:23:00] had two boys one by the name of Cain one
[1:23:02] by the name of name of Abel right so we
[1:23:05] know that there was pregnancy that took
[1:23:07] place there was no fruit that any woman
[1:23:10] can eat that will allow her to get
[1:23:12] pregnant we might as well be honest
[1:23:15] right there is no fruit that a woman can
[1:23:17] eat if it if it exists why aren't women
[1:23:20] eating the same fruit today and having
[1:23:23] babies huh there's only one way we know
[1:23:27] that women get pregnant y'all gonna talk
[1:23:30] to me it's only one way we know
[1:23:33] hallelujah right Amen so what would the
[1:23:36] same way that women get pregnant today
[1:23:38] is the same way Eve got pregnant in the
[1:23:40] beginning however we have a we have a
[1:23:42] problem here because as we go further
[1:23:45] into Genesis will notice them something
[1:23:47] happens and you probably read it in
[1:23:49] Scripture why are there two lineages
[1:23:52] listed huh you start looking at the
[1:23:56] lineage of adamant and in this son and
[1:23:58] that son then you also start seeing a
[1:24:00] lineage of Cain evidently Adam was not
[1:24:03] Cain's daddy and not only that the Bible
[1:24:08] clearly says that Adam I mean that Cain
[1:24:11] worse of that wicked one
[1:24:15] so Cain's daddy was different than Adam
[1:24:17] however his mama was Eve alright so so
[1:24:24] so what we see here is
[1:24:25] Eve had a relationship with somebody in
[1:24:28] the garden outside of Adam and according
[1:24:31] to the Bible it was with the serpent now
[1:24:33] most people say you talk about a snake
[1:24:35] on the ground no I'm not talking about a
[1:24:37] snake on the ground I'm talk about a
[1:24:39] snake that stood on two feet before he
[1:24:41] went to the ground because he got cursed
[1:24:44] and widowhood on his belly so before the
[1:24:46] curse he stood on two feet talk like a
[1:24:49] man walk like a man acted like a man to
[1:24:53] have a conversation with even Eve not
[1:24:56] realizing that it was not the serpent
[1:24:59] talking to her but the serpent had been
[1:25:01] anointed by the devil oh you don't
[1:25:05] believe the devil go into animals ax
[1:25:09] leads him when he got delivered where
[1:25:12] did the devil's go pekes the devil will
[1:25:17] ignore an animal yes he will hallelujah
[1:25:21] God could also ignore an animal who
[1:25:26] talked to Balaam God anointed mule to
[1:25:32] talk right amen see I mean so so so so
[1:25:35] don't don't don't don't don't don't
[1:25:36] don't don't get caught up in like God
[1:25:39] don't use that no no no no no animals
[1:25:41] can be used by God animals can be used
[1:25:43] by the devil hallelujah
[1:25:46] can I tell you also something you can be
[1:25:47] used by God or you can be used by the
[1:25:49] devil let's look at this because we're
[1:25:53] looking at these three these three
[1:25:54] things just lust of the flesh this lust
[1:25:56] of the eyes pride of life remember I
[1:25:58] share with y'all for the past couple
[1:25:59] weeks I Eve took a peep at the world
[1:26:02] this is her peep at the world now you
[1:26:04] know I want you understand her little
[1:26:05] peep when the Bible say love not the
[1:26:07] world Eve took a peep at the world and
[1:26:09] just a little peep at the world not the
[1:26:11] stuff that you know that we might deal
[1:26:13] with the day but one of the things that
[1:26:15] we don't talk about the day people do
[1:26:16] deal with this this less than a flesh
[1:26:18] everybody deal with this hallelujah
[1:26:21] let's look at this verse verse five amen
[1:26:25] amen
[1:26:26] now I just gave you a summarized version
[1:26:28] if you don't believe what I just said
[1:26:30] you have to go read the whole chapter
[1:26:31] Genesis 3 and then ask God to reveal to
[1:26:34] you between the lines what happened
[1:26:35] because now when God was dishing out
[1:26:38] punishment he
[1:26:39] call Adam he caught Eve and he called
[1:26:41] the serpent he did not call any other
[1:26:44] animal so the serpent had something to
[1:26:46] do with this great fall
[1:26:47] praise the Lord God wasn't just picking
[1:26:49] on the serpent and when he acts Eve what
[1:26:53] happened to her what did she say the
[1:26:56] serpent beguiled me that mean tricked me
[1:26:59] was talking with me see that's why I say
[1:27:03] you gotta watch you talk of it because
[1:27:04] though sometimes people are norther by
[1:27:06] the devil do you realize Peter was with
[1:27:10] Jesus slept with Jesus walk with Jesus
[1:27:13] talk with Jesus but that kind of time he
[1:27:16] had a minor revelation of who Jesus was
[1:27:18] then he got anointed by the devil and
[1:27:20] Jesus had to tell Peter get thee behind
[1:27:23] me Satan they weren't talking to Peter
[1:27:27] he was talking to the devil that was
[1:27:29] talking to Peter alright let's go on a
[1:27:34] little further here we are in verse 5 in
[1:27:39] Genesis 3 for God doth know that in the
[1:27:42] day you eat thereof then your eyes shall
[1:27:47] be opened and ye shall be as God's
[1:27:51] knowing good and evil
[1:27:54] verse 6 says and when the woman saw that
[1:27:58] the tree was good for food so now when
[1:28:01] she saw that the tree was good for food
[1:28:03] this is where it was a breakdown in the
[1:28:06] lust of the flesh because she saw that
[1:28:10] means she partook of something and she
[1:28:12] saw that it was good for food oh my god
[1:28:15] y'all gonna make me get real deep in
[1:28:17] here today a man a man I got another
[1:28:20] scripture for y'all because y'all think
[1:28:22] I'm maybe I give that to you right now
[1:28:24] before I go a little further
[1:28:25] hold that scripture I'm coming back
[1:28:27] there so I want y'all to understand cuz
[1:28:29] you know you're looking at tree and you
[1:28:30] thinkin see it's a physical tree no no
[1:28:33] no no no
[1:28:34] know that you got these allegories you
[1:28:37] got to be able to read between the lines
[1:28:39] now I'm gonna show you how a man let's
[1:28:41] read proverbs 30 and 20 and I'm gonna
[1:28:44] try to get back on my subject here
[1:28:46] proverbs 30 and 20 and then I will go
[1:28:49] back to Genesis praise God you know and
[1:28:51] I find it amazing how a Solomon even
[1:28:54] picked up on this he says such as the
[1:28:57] way of an adulterous woman this is the
[1:29:00] woman that commits adultery and look at
[1:29:02] his analogy that he uses such as a way
[1:29:05] of an adulterous woman she eateth and
[1:29:08] wipe with her mouth now what is adultery
[1:29:11] and eating got to do with each other
[1:29:13] amen she eateth and wipe with her mouth
[1:29:16] and says I have done no wickedness now
[1:29:19] Solomon brings both of these together so
[1:29:21] now we can tie what happened in the
[1:29:23] garden of eatin with Eve when we talk
[1:29:25] about eating from the feet of a tree but
[1:29:28] it wasn't just no physical tree this was
[1:29:30] an adultery that took place in the god
[1:29:33] of eating that caused her to get
[1:29:34] pregnant pregnant remove from the
[1:29:36] serpent all right let me go on Genesis 3
[1:29:39] now we want to pick up here because she
[1:29:41] failed for the lust of the flesh this is
[1:29:42] what happened in the Garden of Eden Eve
[1:29:44] fell for the lust of the flesh
[1:29:46] she failed for the lust of the eye and
[1:29:48] she fell with the pride of life look at
[1:29:50] this now verse 6 says and when the woman
[1:29:52] saw that the tree was good for food
[1:29:55] that's lust of the flesh she fell right
[1:29:57] there amen and that it was pleasant to
[1:30:01] the eyes lust of the eyes right there
[1:30:04] she fell all right and a tree to be
[1:30:07] desired to make one wise proud of life
[1:30:13] popularity self-interest right not now
[1:30:16] she was already and notice how the devil
[1:30:18] sorta sold her a lie and said that she
[1:30:21] would be like God she was already like
[1:30:24] God she was made in His image
[1:30:27] the devil actually Amen twisted the Word
[1:30:31] of God on her oh my and she fell for
[1:30:34] this lie and when she fell she took a
[1:30:37] peep at the world oh I wish you took a
[1:30:40] people in the world now we got to go to
[1:30:42] funerals now we got to go to the
[1:30:44] hospital because Eve took a people in
[1:30:46] the world now but don't part your finger
[1:30:48] eat
[1:30:48] because many of us in the same situation
[1:30:51] we have took the same peep at the world
[1:30:53] and we're not compromised with the
[1:30:55] things have gone alright let me go on a
[1:30:58] little further look at this when the
[1:31:00] woman saw that the tree was good for
[1:31:01] food and that it was pleasant to the
[1:31:03] eyes and a tree to a tree to be desired
[1:31:06] to make one wise she took of the fruit
[1:31:08] thereof and did eat and gave also a
[1:31:11] husband with her and he did eat now if
[1:31:15] we could just be so bold you know when
[1:31:19] they fail here when they got in trouble
[1:31:20] they Eve Eve was the one that actually
[1:31:22] fell first and noticed when she failed
[1:31:25] she let her husband write off into the
[1:31:27] same thing Adam did it willfully
[1:31:30] according to the Bible Adam did it
[1:31:32] willfully now but she led her husband
[1:31:35] off into this distance this thing now I
[1:31:37] wanted I want to just in full warn the
[1:31:39] sisters when you've fallen for lust of
[1:31:41] the lust of the flesh lust of the eyes
[1:31:42] pride of life amen be careful don't put
[1:31:45] your husband in a situation where he got
[1:31:47] to choose God over you i'ma say it again
[1:31:53] sisters don't put yourself in a
[1:31:54] situation where you have to make your
[1:31:56] husband choose God over you because if
[1:31:58] you got a real husband I can already
[1:32:00] tell you you've lost and i'ma tell you
[1:32:05] if you got a husband that loved you more
[1:32:07] than he loved God you got the wrong man
[1:32:12] you got the wrong man
[1:32:13] you want a man that love God more than
[1:32:15] he loved you and manna to tell you when
[1:32:18] you're wrong Adam should've told if she
[1:32:20] was wrong but Adam did this as a tight
[1:32:23] Adam Whitley did this because by Adam
[1:32:26] willfully going out to a man he knew
[1:32:28] when God came down he was gonna take Eve
[1:32:30] out right but he said I'm gonna go out
[1:32:31] with her is the same way at God himself
[1:32:34] leaving his throne and glory to come
[1:32:35] down to earth to redeem fallen man it
[1:32:37] was a willing act all right so we can
[1:32:42] see here in Scripture Eve fell with the
[1:32:45] lust of the flesh she fell with the lust
[1:32:48] of the eye and she fell with the pride
[1:32:50] of life
[1:32:51] now I now look at this verse 7 this is
[1:32:53] why I say when people fall in this place
[1:32:55] look at this that the eyes of them both
[1:32:57] were opened and they knew that they were
[1:32:59] naked now we know you know they eat no
[1:33:01] Apple and recognize
[1:33:02] was naked come on y'all if we know
[1:33:04] something deeper half in there this was
[1:33:06] adultery all right adultery and say say
[1:33:08] at the eyes of them both were opened and
[1:33:10] they knew that they were naked and they
[1:33:12] sewed fig leaves together me and made
[1:33:14] themselves aprons now look at this verse
[1:33:16] verse 8 and they heard the voice of the
[1:33:18] Lord God walking in the garden in the
[1:33:20] cool of the day and Adam and his wife
[1:33:22] hid themselves from the presence of the
[1:33:23] Lord God amongst the trees of the garden
[1:33:25] and the Lord got called in to Adam and
[1:33:27] said unto Him where art thou now this
[1:33:29] why I say when people fall to lust of
[1:33:31] the flesh lust of the eye proud of life
[1:33:34] what happens it's church attendance is
[1:33:36] the first thing that's impacted because
[1:33:39] when God God used to come down and even
[1:33:41] the cool of the evening every day and
[1:33:43] they were half Church he would have
[1:33:45] Church with Adam and Eve but this day he
[1:33:48] came to church and God was the only one
[1:33:50] in church and so he had the cost and
[1:33:55] notice now here's a couple things I need
[1:33:57] you to notice here he did not say Eve
[1:33:59] Eve where art thou
[1:34:02] he called for Adam you want to know why
[1:34:05] I come for Adam because Adam was held
[1:34:07] responsible for what happened in the
[1:34:09] Garden of Eden hallelujah and husbands I
[1:34:13] want to tell you something you are here
[1:34:14] responsible for what happens within your
[1:34:16] family praise the Lord somebody a man so
[1:34:22] when God came down he looked for Adam
[1:34:24] where I found Adam was hiding behind the
[1:34:26] trees it wasn't that God didn't know
[1:34:28] where Adam was God knows all things he
[1:34:31] knew exactly where Adam was but he
[1:34:32] needed Adam to realize look when you've
[1:34:34] messed up don't run from me can I tell
[1:34:39] you something that if you messed up
[1:34:41] don't run from God run to God hallelujah
[1:34:50] let me go on a little further a man I'm
[1:34:53] telling you love not the world Eve took
[1:34:54] a peep at the world and it caused all
[1:34:57] the problems that we have today and i'ma
[1:34:58] tell you when you start people that the
[1:35:00] world is gonna cause problems in your
[1:35:01] life as well a man let me go on a little
[1:35:05] further here now in that quote that we
[1:35:07] were just reading there out of latest in
[1:35:08] church age age he said and each of the
[1:35:11] three major trials that correspondent
[1:35:13] exactly to the temptation of the Garden
[1:35:15] of Eden
[1:35:16] the lust of the flesh the lust of the
[1:35:17] eye the proud of life Jesus overcame by
[1:35:20] the word
[1:35:20] now remember lust of the flesh is when
[1:35:22] we fall into physical desires
[1:35:24] and let me just kind of inject this this
[1:35:27] is out of first Corinthians 6 I knew I
[1:35:31] had to read this today this scripture
[1:35:33] because this is a lust of the flesh now
[1:35:35] I know it's not really said much in
[1:35:38] church no more a man but fornication is
[1:35:41] still against God's Word it ain't change
[1:35:45] fornication adultery all that is against
[1:35:48] God's Word praise the Lord and when you
[1:35:51] fall into fornication you fall into the
[1:35:53] lust of the flesh and it's telling you
[1:35:55] the love of God is not in you you cannot
[1:35:58] use the excuse God understands and you
[1:36:03] you you if you're if you're going out on
[1:36:05] your marriage vow you made it you made a
[1:36:08] commitment not only to God you made a
[1:36:10] commitment to your spouse that you're
[1:36:11] going to keep yourself if you're going
[1:36:13] out of your marriage vows you need to
[1:36:14] make things right
[1:36:15] hello somebody God came blessed over
[1:36:18] your mess God came bless the people at
[1:36:23] home my god that's what that's why you
[1:36:25] got this like your blessing back got a
[1:36:27] hole in the bottom of it you got to make
[1:36:30] some things right even the Prophet
[1:36:32] taught us that you know this one sister
[1:36:33] committed adultery on her husband and
[1:36:35] she thought when I told that to the Lord
[1:36:37] I'd made it right with God said sister
[1:36:38] you didn't you didn't just you didn't
[1:36:39] just do that to your husband you did
[1:36:41] that to your army to God you did that to
[1:36:43] your husband you need to make things
[1:36:45] right with your husband as well as with
[1:36:47] God she said where our God already
[1:36:48] forgave his sister the reason you
[1:36:50] dealing with the things you do it
[1:36:52] because you have not made things right
[1:36:53] with your husband he's saying I go and
[1:36:57] get that thing right and she said
[1:36:58] they're like I can't do it he gotta
[1:36:59] leave me God has already left you and
[1:37:02] she was a Sunday school teacher didn't
[1:37:06] realize God had already left it that's
[1:37:08] why she's being tormented by a devil or
[1:37:10] I might as well say these things summary
[1:37:13] the reason that we're not able to get
[1:37:14] free from some of the stuff that's going
[1:37:16] on like we haven't made things right we
[1:37:21] need to go back and make things right
[1:37:23] hallelujah you got to go confess that
[1:37:26] amen

[1:40:03] dealing with it you got to go make
[1:40:08] things right you ain't gonna be blessed
[1:40:10] until you make things right now I don't
[1:40:13] watch folk make things right and I watch
[1:40:15] god bless them now watch other people
[1:40:19] just under curse all the time because
[1:40:21] they made things right let's go over
[1:40:24] here first Corinthians a man this this
[1:40:26] lust of the flesh we all deal with it
[1:40:29] first Corinthians chapter 6
[1:40:30] look at verse 12 let's just read this
[1:40:33] y'all bear with me in a day glory to God
[1:40:36] it says in all all things are lawful to
[1:40:39] me but all things are not expedient all
[1:40:40] things are lawful for me but I will not
[1:40:42] be brought under the power of any right
[1:40:45] meats for the belly and the belly for
[1:40:48] meats but God shall destroy both it and
[1:40:51] them now the body is not for and I don't
[1:40:56] only one is that though is that only in
[1:40:58] my Bible now I know I know they got all
[1:41:00] these new Bibles out nowadays they
[1:41:02] taking these words I so people don't
[1:41:04] feel offended but I'm going back to the
[1:41:10] King James Version we're not we're not
[1:41:13] taking it out we gotta live it the way
[1:41:15] it's written right he said but now the
[1:41:18] body is not for fornication but for the
[1:41:22] Lord's all right and the Lord for the
[1:41:25] body let's keep up somebody say read and
[1:41:28] God had both raised up the Lord and will
[1:41:31] also raise up raise up us by his own
[1:41:35] power know ye not that our bodies are
[1:41:38] the members of Christ shall I then take
[1:41:42] the members of Christ and make them the
[1:41:45] members of a harlot Oh
[1:41:48] let it go that go pretty deep because
[1:41:51] they got multiple meanings you realize
[1:41:54] the Catholic Church is known as the
[1:41:56] great
[1:41:58] amen a denominational group known as the
[1:42:00] great but she gave birth to
[1:42:02] children and every child that come for
[1:42:05] underneath that system is known as a
[1:42:08] harlot that's why you can't go
[1:42:11] fellowship and everywhere you got to
[1:42:14] stay true to the Word of God let me go a
[1:42:16] little further it said the members of
[1:42:18] the harlot God for beings it said what
[1:42:21] no you're not that he was just drawn to
[1:42:23] a harlot is one body for two staff he
[1:42:26] shall be one flesh
[1:42:27] let's go on but he that is joined until
[1:42:30] the lord is one spirit now look at what
[1:42:35] verse 18 tell you to do now this does
[1:42:37] this mean this first first first you got
[1:42:40] a commandment a man from from Paul Lee
[1:42:44] that being run from it that's why you
[1:42:48] can't you know if this fella acting like
[1:42:51] the devil whispering sweet nothings he
[1:42:53] made you smile like that you know that's
[1:42:56] that's a spirit coming from the
[1:42:57] underworld
[1:42:59] that's the spirit coming from the
[1:43:01] underworld or pull you down God got an
[1:43:03] anointed ever come from the pulpit to
[1:43:05] pull you back up right but but a
[1:43:09] fornication is something that you don't
[1:43:10] play around with if you've been Amen
[1:43:13] have you been guilty of this and I'm not
[1:43:14] trying to bring this message to bring
[1:43:16] condemnation I'm not doing that but when
[1:43:18] I am trying to tell you that we got it
[1:43:19] we got it we cannot love the world all
[1:43:21] the things of the world and say that we
[1:43:23] love God and don't work that way if you
[1:43:26] love God you gotta obey his word God you
[1:43:30] understand I just I just be struggling
[1:43:32] how long you been struggling how long
[1:43:35] you want to keep struggling can I can I
[1:43:38] just be honest with you some of us
[1:43:39] worship the devil's that's got us bound
[1:43:45] we worship gossip
[1:43:48] we worship lust we worship these things
[1:43:52] I mean now you you you are and I don't
[1:43:54] get me wrong I know sometimes you can
[1:43:55] get an honor with a spirit but every
[1:43:57] time you get a Church you ought to be
[1:43:58] trying to get free from that thing you
[1:44:02] ought to be trying to get free not not
[1:44:03] not in the world Lord understand and you
[1:44:05] know we just keep
[1:44:06] you got to make things right and that's
[1:44:09] why we used to go to the altar to get
[1:44:10] get our hearts right with God now we
[1:44:13] just you know and you know you're wrong
[1:44:15] everybody else know you're wrong but you
[1:44:17] ain't gonna say nothing all right flee
[1:44:20] fornication I'm going on every sin that
[1:44:25] a man doeth is without the body but he
[1:44:28] that committeth fornication sinneth
[1:44:30] again his against his own body
[1:44:32] can I go further what no you're not that
[1:44:36] your body is the temple of the Holy
[1:44:40] Ghost which is in you now you claim to
[1:44:44] be feel the Holy Spirit but you out here
[1:44:46] come in fornication something wrong with
[1:44:47] you ain't give me a man's on this one I
[1:44:50] know it Lord delights to save man to it
[1:44:53] it's the truth anyhow say what know ye
[1:44:56] not that your body is the temple Holy
[1:44:58] Ghost which is in you which ye have what
[1:45:01] which you have of God and ye are not
[1:45:02] your own little further four-year boat
[1:45:08] with a price therefore glorify God in
[1:45:12] your body so you got overcoming lust of
[1:45:17] the flesh glorify God in your body and
[1:45:20] in your spirit which are gods
[1:45:24] your body belongs to God and your spirit
[1:45:26] belongs to God and what what the Bible
[1:45:29] tells us to do is glorify God in our
[1:45:32] bodies and in our spirits we have to
[1:45:34] overcome the lust of the flesh lust of
[1:45:36] the eyes pride of life amen
[1:45:38] and and the only way you're gonna
[1:45:40] overcome is by using the word now you
[1:45:43] know when the devil talking that when
[1:45:45] that text come that come from that other
[1:45:47] dimension and you sit there you read it
[1:45:52] you know something you know that thing
[1:45:54] that was the devil and all and you know
[1:45:57] how you know what you got to do is
[1:45:59] ignore it
[1:46:00] don't be responding back with no smiley
[1:46:02] faces praise the Lord somebody when you
[1:46:08] tell them to devil no you gotta mean no
[1:46:12] all right Jesus overcame by the word can
[1:46:15] I show you that in Matthew 4 let's just
[1:46:18] read this
[1:46:19] yeah I'll bear with me because in that
[1:46:22] quote we found out that this is how
[1:46:24] Jesus overcame now that now Satan trick
[1:46:26] Eve and she fell a mental lust of the
[1:46:30] flesh lust of the eye and the pride of
[1:46:31] life she failed to all of this but Jesus
[1:46:34] overcame these three things with the
[1:46:36] Word of God if he overcame physical
[1:46:39] desire he overcame personal desire and
[1:46:41] he also overcame self interest or what
[1:46:44] we call popularity praise the Lord
[1:46:46] that's that's some time that's a that's
[1:46:48] a devil that makes us want to be popular
[1:46:50] you know when we it's one thing when God
[1:46:53] makes you popular but it's another thing
[1:46:55] were you trying to put yourself all out
[1:46:56] there aid man church say I mean you know
[1:47:00] it's some crazy things that have people
[1:47:02] become popular do some real demonic
[1:47:06] things to become popular God don't want
[1:47:09] you to do it that way if God wanted you
[1:47:11] to to have all these follows here give
[1:47:13] them to you amen
[1:47:16] praise the Lord I told you if you start
[1:47:18] giving the word they won't follow you
[1:47:20] anyway Amen hallelujah glory to God
[1:47:29] father I thank you for your word now Ken
[1:47:33] let's read here in Matthew 4 let's read
[1:47:36] this now I want you to just kind of
[1:47:38] catch some things here let's start at
[1:47:39] verse 3 in Matthew 4 and when the
[1:47:45] tempter came to him he said if thou be
[1:47:47] the Son of God command that these stones
[1:47:50] be made bread but he answered and said
[1:47:53] it is written man should not live by
[1:47:55] bread alone but by every word that
[1:47:57] proceedeth out of the mouth of God now
[1:48:01] now when here we hear when Satan was
[1:48:03] trying to tip the tip the Lord Jesus he
[1:48:06] was actually trying to get him to fall
[1:48:08] here a man in the lust of the flesh he
[1:48:10] was hungry
[1:48:11] a man so he was trying to get him to
[1:48:13] fall in this area and now Jesus overcame
[1:48:15] by the word now the Prophet tells us
[1:48:18] something here he says Satan came and
[1:48:20] this isn't a message how can I overcome
[1:48:22] but don't worry about pulling this one
[1:48:23] up
[1:48:23] he says Satan came and he wanted him to
[1:48:26] use his own power on his self to feed
[1:48:28] him wanted to feed himself he was hungry
[1:48:31] a man
[1:48:32] when a man gets hungry he can do almost
[1:48:34] anything he'll steal Rob beg borrow
[1:48:38] anything see and he had that appetite
[1:48:41] and Satan used his first great major
[1:48:44] assault upon him to take his power that
[1:48:47] he had been given to overcome with and
[1:48:49] use it on himself he didn't use it on
[1:48:51] himself
[1:48:52] no he used it on others that's right he
[1:48:54] used it on another time himself it
[1:48:55] wasn't for him though he could have done
[1:48:57] it he certainly could have done it but
[1:48:59] see he would have failed if he would
[1:49:00] have done it then who would fail to lust
[1:49:02] of the flesh and that's all Satan was
[1:49:04] trying to do is get him to use his power
[1:49:05] on himself here here the tempter came
[1:49:07] said if thou be the Son of God turn
[1:49:09] these stones into bread so now you know
[1:49:11] your hunger you just come up with fast
[1:49:12] do this use this power and stuff he
[1:49:15] would have failed at lust of the flesh
[1:49:17] right there the way Jesus overcame and
[1:49:19] lust of the flesh as he took the devil
[1:49:21] back to the word in verse 4 he says it
[1:49:24] is written man shall not live by bread
[1:49:26] alone but by every word that proceedeth
[1:49:28] out of the mouth of God he overcame the
[1:49:30] devil in the lusts of the flesh by using
[1:49:33] the word then let's go on a little
[1:49:35] further here notice this next verse
[1:49:37] verse verse five and I want to tell you
[1:49:41] something it watch watch how this works
[1:49:43] because you might overcome the devil in
[1:49:45] one area of your life he coming back he
[1:49:51] coming back I remember my past used to
[1:49:54] say you know you it's like going to a
[1:49:56] baseball game and here comes the devil
[1:49:59] saying popcorn popcorn popcorn now I
[1:50:01] don't really want no popcorn they come
[1:50:03] back ice cream ice cream ice cream no I
[1:50:07] don't really want to ice cream soda soda
[1:50:10] soda I really don't want no soda they
[1:50:12] never say something hot dog hot dog hot
[1:50:13] dog lady wait a minute
[1:50:15] hot dog sounding pretty good but you
[1:50:18] don't realize that once you get the hot
[1:50:19] dog you're gonna need the soda or if you
[1:50:24] got the popcorn your throat gonna get
[1:50:27] dry you're gonna need the soda so they'd
[1:50:30] ever know how to keep coming with most
[1:50:32] stuff for you a man church now watching
[1:50:35] me in verse verse 5 now Jesus defeated
[1:50:38] him with the word and I look at him in
[1:50:39] verse 5 then the devil taketh him up
[1:50:42] into the holy city and setteth him on a
[1:50:45] pen
[1:50:46] of the temple and said unto him if thou
[1:50:49] be the Son of God cast thyself down for
[1:50:52] it is written he shall give his angels
[1:50:54] charge concerning thee and in their
[1:50:57] hands they shall bear thee up lest at
[1:50:58] any time thou dash thy foot against a
[1:51:00] stone now wait a minute wait a minute if
[1:51:02] I just caught that correctly the devil
[1:51:04] use the word on Jesus don't let that
[1:51:09] devil do that do you like what the devil
[1:51:10] were trying to treat now he used the
[1:51:12] word on Eve now he's using the word on
[1:51:15] Jesus and that's let me tell you
[1:51:17] something if you don't know the word
[1:51:19] you'll be tricked by the word i'ma say
[1:51:25] it again if you don't know the word you
[1:51:28] will be tricked by the word look at this
[1:51:31] cuz because this is this is what you
[1:51:33] know verse 7 says didn't Jesus say to
[1:51:35] him it is written again so you got to be
[1:51:38] able to go toe to toe with this devil
[1:51:40] yea yea yea it is written that he'll
[1:51:42] he'll give his anus child to me but also
[1:51:43] it is written again thou should not tell
[1:51:46] the LORD thy God let's see what the
[1:51:50] Prophet said about this particular
[1:51:52] passage he said that our Satan was
[1:51:54] actually trying to get Jesus glory to
[1:51:57] God amen he was he was tempting him to
[1:52:00] be a show-off see that's where that
[1:52:04] luster the lust of the eye come in right
[1:52:06] and even pride of life kind of coming
[1:52:08] that same thing when people trying to be
[1:52:10] a show-off rather than just letting God
[1:52:13] actually exalt you oftentimes we try to
[1:52:16] exalt ourselves
[1:52:17] that's what lust of the eye does amen we
[1:52:19] see somebody else got a whole bunch of
[1:52:21] followers we try to get we try to meet
[1:52:23] meet they status not allowing God to
[1:52:25] exalt you right Amen you doing all this
[1:52:28] in your own Amen I can do this and I can
[1:52:31] do that don't forget you ain't got
[1:52:33] nowhere without God even where you are
[1:52:35] right now it's because a God puts you
[1:52:38] there
[1:52:39] hallelujah Church hallelujah but
[1:52:43] oftentimes we forget about God we think
[1:52:45] our success came from something that we
[1:52:47] did I went to school I did this I know
[1:52:50] you didn't God gave you the ability God
[1:52:54] I'm none of your mind you forgot you
[1:52:55] pray through some tests
[1:52:59] you forgot you actually got to help you
[1:53:01] with that huh and now you don't made it
[1:53:05] not a list that I got you and now you're
[1:53:08] going after you're going after look I
[1:53:10] mean when we look at this amen or order
[1:53:13] proud of life either one you can kind of
[1:53:14] fit in there
[1:53:15] here brother brems say if you want to be
[1:53:17] something before the people stand up
[1:53:19] here on this temple and jump off see
[1:53:21] I'll give you a scripture for it because
[1:53:24] it's written he gave his angels charge
[1:53:25] over thee lest any time dash of foot
[1:53:27] against a stone heat better yet to make
[1:53:29] him a show-off to show his authority no
[1:53:33] true servant of God ever does that let's
[1:53:39] go a little further here we can see
[1:53:40] where Jesus overcame a man this devil
[1:53:43] with these three wild attacks by using
[1:53:45] the word in the same way we're gonna
[1:53:47] overcome this devil in this ours by
[1:53:49] using God's Word verse 8 here he comes
[1:53:51] again again the devil takes him up into
[1:53:56] an exceeding high mountain and show with
[1:54:00] him glory to God a man showed him all
[1:54:03] the kingdoms of the world and the glory
[1:54:05] of them now I want you to understand
[1:54:08] just by looking at this scripture we can
[1:54:10] see Satan is behind the politics Satan
[1:54:15] is behind it all Satan who owns it all
[1:54:17] here he's going to show Jesus what he'll
[1:54:21] give him that means Satan has control of
[1:54:23] it right now now let me let me go a
[1:54:25] little further and stand under him all
[1:54:27] these things will I give thee if thou
[1:54:30] wilt fall down and worship Me now verse
[1:54:33] 10 says then said Jesus unto him get
[1:54:36] thee hence Satan for it is written thou
[1:54:40] shalt worship the Lord thy God and him
[1:54:42] what only shalt thou serve I love this
[1:54:50] because what we found here is what what
[1:54:53] Satan was trying to do to Jesus amen and
[1:54:55] getting him this again lust of the eye
[1:54:57] lusted I mean pride of life all that can
[1:54:59] be found in there but here what most
[1:55:01] most believe is that that's what Satan
[1:55:04] actually in Norton the lust of the eye
[1:55:05] and what he was trying to do brother
[1:55:07] entellus he's trying to give Jesus a
[1:55:09] kingdom without going through
[1:55:11] a Calvary he was trying to give him a
[1:55:15] kingdom without going through a Calvary
[1:55:17] you know let me tell you something when
[1:55:19] you look in Scripture people that were
[1:55:21] exalted went through something before
[1:55:24] David became King he was on the run
[1:55:28] before before Joseph became second in
[1:55:32] charge he went to prison so so you got
[1:55:35] to understand we got to go through
[1:55:37] because this is what people trying to
[1:55:38] bypass they trying to bypass the process
[1:55:40] of their character developing hallelujah
[1:55:47] but but you can't bypass that process
[1:55:49] God got to take you through some hard
[1:55:51] knocks to see if he can trust you with
[1:55:54] the power that you're looking for and
[1:55:58] the only way you're gonna get there
[1:56:00] through God school is you got to go
[1:56:02] through some trials and you got to
[1:56:04] overcome them all hallelujah all right
[1:56:09] I'm almost there yeah I'll just bear
[1:56:10] with me a little bit longer listen he
[1:56:12] said I got this again out of this
[1:56:14] message the Prophet spoke on how can
[1:56:18] overcome he said this about about Jesus
[1:56:20] say he's trying to give him a kingdom
[1:56:21] without Calvary so remember he was
[1:56:23] trying to get him to forfeit it without
[1:56:25] the cross if he did we would be lost he
[1:56:30] could have took the kingdom but he must
[1:56:33] he must come back he was tempted to do
[1:56:36] it now
[1:56:36] death is a hard thing he was tempted to
[1:56:39] take his liberty and be the king of the
[1:56:41] earth without the cross but if he did
[1:56:44] his subjects would have died Satan would
[1:56:47] have been Satan would have gladly made
[1:56:49] that proposition with him but he said
[1:56:51] get behind me Satan
[1:56:52] he didn't do it see he overcame the lust
[1:56:55] of the eye he overcame the lust of the
[1:56:56] flesh he overcame the pride of life a
[1:56:59] man with the Word of God and let me tell
[1:57:01] you something that may seem simple but
[1:57:03] that's exactly the formula that you
[1:57:05] gonna need to be successful and
[1:57:07] overcoming the devil in this hour your
[1:57:11] good feeling I don't get it you're
[1:57:13] jumping you're shouting don't get it but
[1:57:15] you got to give the devil two words and
[1:57:17] let me tell you something he got
[1:57:19] something for you I was I was sharing
[1:57:22] with you know you all a few weeks ago
[1:57:25] when when when the fella I was telling
[1:57:30] you all Nimrod
[1:57:32] so when Nimrod what he was going for the
[1:57:36] Genesis 11 he was going for three things
[1:57:38] he wanted to build a strong nation a man
[1:57:41] he wanted to propagate his own religion
[1:57:43] and they wanted to make a name for
[1:57:44] himself I've always said this I remember
[1:57:47] one person got upset with me for saying
[1:57:49] it but this church we're not looking for
[1:57:51] church members I'm gonna tell you who
[1:57:53] we're looking for
[1:57:54] the bride we just want to be a church
[1:57:58] full we want the bride and see the bride
[1:58:01] gonna be an agreement with the Word of
[1:58:03] God all right and the other thing other
[1:58:05] thing about you know if we were a church
[1:58:07] that's trying to go on after church
[1:58:08] members we let down all the standards I
[1:58:10] would never stand in the pulpit and
[1:58:11] preach a sermon like this I couldn't
[1:58:13] even read 1st Corinthians amen in some
[1:58:16] churches praise the Lord they wouldn't
[1:58:18] let me oh you go what - what you again
[1:58:20] I'm not against nobody I love everybody
[1:58:23] but I hate sin I know churches you can't
[1:58:28] preach against homosexuality
[1:58:31] but here you can because it's in the
[1:58:34] Bible if it's isn't about we can preach
[1:58:37] it and it's not hate speech I'm gonna
[1:58:40] tell you what's hate speech when when
[1:58:42] they hate Christians for saying it huh
[1:58:46] it's the truth when we when they hate
[1:58:48] Christians and don't want Christians and
[1:58:50] say that's hate speech I mean you know
[1:58:52] when you talk about tolerance the people
[1:58:56] that's not being tolerated is the people
[1:58:58] that's preaching it and living it that's
[1:59:02] the bus that's not being tolerated hey
[1:59:05] man there's a truth in it hi right hey
[1:59:08] man I mean you know one of these days we
[1:59:09] gonna come to church they might have to
[1:59:11] put the padlock so we don't told them to
[1:59:13] stop preaching that it's gonna happen
[1:59:17] Church all you got to do is go around go
[1:59:20] visit some other churches they would
[1:59:21] never say anything like this runner
[1:59:22] pulpit small crowds over this but when
[1:59:26] Jesus gave the truth is the truth is
[1:59:28] what set him free all right amen Nimrod
[1:59:32] wanted to do three things build a strong
[1:59:34] nation propagate his own religion make a
[1:59:36] name for himself proud of life and make
[1:59:38] it
[1:59:39] named for himself right he fell I'm
[1:59:41] actually he actually accomplished all
[1:59:43] three of those things but he did it his
[1:59:45] way not God's Way and because he did it
[1:59:48] his way not God's Way the thing came to
[1:59:50] a end it style fell apart when God came
[1:59:55] down listen i'ma tell you these
[1:59:57] denominations will fall apart when God
[2:00:00] comes down amen if we're doing it
[2:00:03] outside of what God has told us to do we
[2:00:05] cannot expect it to be successful let me
[2:00:08] go on a little further here I wanted to
[2:00:10] just read something I was been sharing
[2:00:13] this and when a brother called me well
[2:00:14] actually text me just yesterday and they
[2:00:17] say brother I've just been kind of
[2:00:19] keeping up with this thought on love not
[2:00:22] the world and said my daddy was
[2:00:23] preaching a little message here at the
[2:00:25] church and as he was preaching my
[2:00:26] thought went back to these these things
[2:00:27] that you've been saying about love not
[2:00:29] the world nor the things of the world
[2:00:30] because the love of God is not not in us
[2:00:32] he said and my daddy hid this scripture
[2:00:34] and I just need to share it with him he
[2:00:35] gave it to me so I'm gonna give it to
[2:00:36] y'all and we're gonna bring it to a
[2:00:37] close today oh my God my God my God look
[2:00:41] at this this is John 17 John 17 we've
[2:00:46] been talking about this see there's
[2:00:47] there's multiple worlds that we're
[2:00:49] looking at here a man which they love
[2:00:52] not the world nor the things of the
[2:00:53] world and and God so loved the world
[2:00:56] with multiple things that we need to
[2:00:57] look at because God made multi worlds
[2:00:59] visible invisible he's made it all and
[2:01:02] there's demons and inside that invisible
[2:01:04] world there's angels also inside that
[2:01:06] invisible world hallelujah
[2:01:08] but God's coming to the world that you
[2:01:10] live in and he's trying to bring
[2:01:12] Redemption to you all right look at this
[2:01:15] John 17 I'm gonna start at verse eight I
[2:01:18] think this is a very very good scripture
[2:01:21] and we'll bring it home verse eight it
[2:01:25] says for I have given unto them the
[2:01:31] words which thou gave us me and I wanna
[2:01:34] I want to borrow the words of Jesus
[2:01:36] because as I was thinking on this whole
[2:01:38] subject of love not the world I was
[2:01:40] there in Tucson I was just reading my
[2:01:42] Bible and that just kind of rolls up I'm
[2:01:44] like man love not the world nor the
[2:01:45] things of the world and this dis dis
[2:01:47] applies in multiple areas it applies in
[2:01:49] the way that we dress yes it does it
[2:01:52] it applies in the way we present
[2:01:54] ourselves as Christians it does apply
[2:01:56] amen even to the church world and what
[2:01:58] to get involved with and what not to get
[2:02:00] involved with it applies to even what
[2:02:02] happened in the garden of eatin right
[2:02:04] this is a very very deep Scripture
[2:02:06] glory to God love not the world nor the
[2:02:08] things world and because it's the lust
[2:02:10] of the flesh lust of the eye private
[2:02:12] life those things that God did not
[2:02:14] God did not God's not the father that
[2:02:17] God is not the author of that that's
[2:02:18] what the devil's using to actually pull
[2:02:21] us away from God so we can't love those
[2:02:23] things
[2:02:23] look at this except so tonight my heart
[2:02:27] I feel like my heart has been delivered
[2:02:28] and I'm barring the words of Jesus if I
[2:02:30] have given unto them the words which
[2:02:33] thou gave us me and they had received
[2:02:36] them and have known surely that I came
[2:02:39] out from thee and they had believed that
[2:02:42] thou did send me look at this I pray for
[2:02:45] them I pray not for the world
[2:02:48] Oh so I thought he loved the world I
[2:02:52] thought God so loved the world that he
[2:02:54] gave his son his only begotten Son but
[2:02:57] here here the son comes on the scene and
[2:02:59] says I pray for them not the world who
[2:03:02] was them and who was the world who's
[2:03:07] there who's the them that he's praying
[2:03:09] for but yeah but we've been told that he
[2:03:11] loves the world not everybody in the
[2:03:13] world there's demons manifested in his
[2:03:15] word he's not dying for them listen let
[2:03:18] me just be honest with you Jesus but God
[2:03:19] would not send his son to die for people
[2:03:21] that were not accepted would you give
[2:03:24] you a child for somebody we're not
[2:03:25] accepted a man God got most sister we
[2:03:29] got I mean so so so hear Jesus say I
[2:03:31] pray for them I guess he's talking about
[2:03:33] you right he's talking about you see you
[2:03:36] don't realize that you are in the world
[2:03:38] but not of the world he's talking about
[2:03:40] you he's praying for you but not those
[2:03:43] that's not going to receive him look at
[2:03:45] this say I pray for them I pray not for
[2:03:48] the world but for them which thou has
[2:03:50] given me for they are thine let me go a
[2:03:54] little further says in all mine a vine
[2:03:57] and thine or mine and I am glorified in
[2:04:03] them and now I am no more
[2:04:06] or in the world glory but these are in
[2:04:09] the world and I come to the Holy Father
[2:04:13] keep through thine own name those whom
[2:04:16] thou has given me that they may be one
[2:04:19] as we are listen while I was with them
[2:04:22] in the world I kept them in thy name
[2:04:28] those that thou gave us me I have kept
[2:04:31] and none of them is lost you know I was
[2:04:36] just thinking about this he said none of
[2:04:39] them loves but the son of perdition that
[2:04:40] the scripture might be fulfilled I'm
[2:04:41] gonna stop there I'm gonna keep on going
[2:04:43] but I was just thinking about this you
[2:04:44] know he said I pray for them not the
[2:04:47] world I pray for them not the world you
[2:04:49] know the Sadducees had their own world
[2:04:51] the Pharisees had their own world but
[2:04:54] that's not the ones that he was praying
[2:04:55] for but the ones that would be impacted
[2:04:57] by their doctrines he preformed and it
[2:05:01] was so I was this morning why we were in
[2:05:02] prayer just kind of came to me I said
[2:05:04] Lord you loved the two that went on the
[2:05:11] road to Emmaus Cleophus and his friend
[2:05:12] you loved them so much that you stopped
[2:05:15] them from going back to the world when
[2:05:20] he showed up and he came from my eyes
[2:05:22] out of the bushes they was on their way
[2:05:25] back to the world back to their
[2:05:27] denominational teachings and he showed
[2:05:30] up and stopped them from going back to
[2:05:32] the world hallelujah and I say if God
[2:05:35] could show up and stop clear pieces from
[2:05:38] going back to the world he's able to
[2:05:40] show up today and stop my loved ones and
[2:05:42] even if they made it back he can still
[2:05:46] do something so great to pull them right
[2:05:48] back out again he don't want you to love
[2:05:53] the world oh my god or the things that's
[2:05:56] the world order the world system the
[2:05:58] world way of doing things and the church
[2:06:00] world is against God's world all right
[2:06:06] all right let's go further in this verse
[2:06:09] 13 and now come out to thee and these
[2:06:15] things I speak in the world that they
[2:06:18] might have
[2:06:19] my joyful field in themselves I have
[2:06:23] given them that word and the world hath
[2:06:25] hated them because they are not of the
[2:06:29] world even as I'm not a world and can I
[2:06:31] tell you something if the world does not
[2:06:32] hate you
[2:06:34] something wrong with your experience
[2:06:37] we're not supposed to blend in with the
[2:06:39] world we're suppose to be different from
[2:06:41] the world amen
[2:06:43] that's what Christian Christian is all
[2:06:45] about we're different from the world we
[2:06:47] always stand out Christian's always
[2:06:50] stand out now come to thee and these
[2:06:54] things verse 13 I speak in the world
[2:06:57] that they might have my joy fulfill in
[2:06:59] themselves I've given them that word and
[2:07:01] the world hath hated them because
[2:07:02] they're not of the world even as I am
[2:07:05] NOT of the world I pray not that thou
[2:07:08] should take us them out of the world
[2:07:11] because some of us acts for that don't
[2:07:13] we Lord I don't want to go through this
[2:07:15] Jesus didn't want to go to that cross
[2:07:17] either but he bared it for us this is
[2:07:21] this since I pray not that thou should
[2:07:23] have take them out of the world but that
[2:07:25] thou should have keep them from the evil
[2:07:27] so that means in this world there's
[2:07:30] gonna be some evil pulling at us and
[2:07:33] what his prayers that God would keep us
[2:07:35] from evil from amen the different
[2:07:37] demonic influences that's trying to pull
[2:07:40] us into the underworld all right that
[2:07:44] thou should just keep them from the evil
[2:07:46] look verse 16 they who is they
[2:07:49] us they are not of the world even as I
[2:07:54] am NOT of the world sanctify them
[2:07:59] through thy truth thy Word is truth as
[2:08:02] thou has sent me into the world even so
[2:08:05] have I also sent them into the world so
[2:08:07] see you know brother Branham talked
[2:08:08] about how we would see this just this
[2:08:10] world of darkness just blackness he said
[2:08:13] but every once while you see a little
[2:08:14] light in the midst of all the darkness
[2:08:17] and say what that light is it's you in
[2:08:19] the midst of the world shining light in
[2:08:21] the midst of some other situation it's
[2:08:23] talking to brother Troy just yesterday
[2:08:24] and when light comes into darkness you
[2:08:27] cannot deny it is there
[2:08:31] going to any darkroom and turn on a
[2:08:34] light darkness has to flee when light
[2:08:37] comes in if darkness is not fleeing when
[2:08:40] you walk into the room can you call
[2:08:45] yourself like Amen
[2:08:49] even if it's candle light darkness flees
[2:08:53] flash light darkness flees but you got
[2:08:57] to be light not darkness let's go on a
[2:09:00] little further sanctify them through
[2:09:02] that truth that word of truth as Dyer
[2:09:04] sent me into the world even so have I
[2:09:06] also sent them into the world and for
[2:09:08] their sakes I sanctify myself and they
[2:09:13] also might be sanctified through the
[2:09:15] truth it was this one brother one time
[2:09:16] shared a statement with brother Branham
[2:09:18] he preached the message say I sanctify
[2:09:20] myself for the sake of others say when
[2:09:23] we live we're not living for ourselves
[2:09:24] but we're living for the sake of others
[2:09:26] somebody's got to be able to see light
[2:09:28] that's why we're here we're here to
[2:09:30] spread light right so so so and let me
[2:09:33] tell you something in order to sanctify
[2:09:35] yourself you have to put off to put off
[2:09:37] the things of the world you have to do
[2:09:39] it gonna have to volunteer to look
[2:09:41] different you know when they volunteer
[2:09:44] for the military they get a different
[2:09:47] suit you don't wear the clothes that you
[2:09:50] wanna wear you only do that in off-duty
[2:09:54] times but as long as you own duty you
[2:09:57] have to put on this uniform because your
[2:09:59] uniform identifies which branch of the
[2:10:01] service you're with amen
[2:10:05] right I mean you don't put on what you
[2:10:07] want to put on when you want to put it
[2:10:09] on they have certain certain things you
[2:10:11] wear at certain times when you are on
[2:10:13] duty if you go to a man a formal event
[2:10:17] there's certain things that you supposed
[2:10:18] to wear at the formal event right if
[2:10:20] you're going to the field of battle
[2:10:21] certain things that you supposed to wear
[2:10:23] as Christians why we got to get all
[2:10:25] shook up when God deal with us about how
[2:10:30] we suppose a dress so if you don't
[2:10:33] complain in the natural military why
[2:10:35] couldn't I complain in God's military it
[2:10:39] may you know even on the Golf Course
[2:10:41] they won't let you wear certain things
[2:10:43] hmm and now in church we just let
[2:10:47] everything go y'all y'all y'all grew up
[2:10:52] in the time where folk at church clothes
[2:10:54] separate from the play clothes and work
[2:10:56] clothes and all that
[2:10:58] now you go we don't know where you're
[2:11:00] going you're going to a bar you're going
[2:11:02] to church it's the truth anyhow that's
[2:11:07] what it used to be the people used to
[2:11:09] and another way people new year's going
[2:11:11] to church not just by the way you was
[2:11:13] dress but you always had that big Bible
[2:11:14] in your hand but not we don't want it on
[2:11:18] we don't want to carry the Bible to be
[2:11:19] identified as believers I got it on my
[2:11:22] phone
[2:11:23] I do too I got it on my phone I got a
[2:11:26] big one too everybody else know what I'm
[2:11:27] get ready to do you're going to church
[2:11:29] yep
[2:11:30] want to go with me alright Church
[2:11:34] hallelujah all right I'm coming home
[2:11:36] look at this it says and for their sakes
[2:11:38] I sanctify myself that they might might
[2:11:41] be sanctified through the truth and
[2:11:43] neither pray I for these alone but for
[2:11:45] them also which they believe oh my god I
[2:11:48] like that neither pray I for these alone
[2:11:50] but for them also which shall believe on
[2:11:54] me through their word so in the midst of
[2:11:57] all this darkness of the world that
[2:11:59] we're living in God got some people
[2:12:01] gonna believe because the life that you
[2:12:03] live in in front of them they're going
[2:12:04] to believe so I'm not just praying that
[2:12:08] he'll you know take you out of the world
[2:12:10] no he just wants to give you strength so
[2:12:12] that you can overcome the evil that's in
[2:12:14] the world right they say but not only
[2:12:16] that I want I want to pray for them and
[2:12:18] not only them but pray for them that's
[2:12:20] gonna believe only testimony verse 21
[2:12:25] says that they all may be one as thou
[2:12:27] father art in me and I in thee that they
[2:12:31] also may be one in us that the world may
[2:12:33] believe that thou has sent me in last
[2:12:37] verse and the glory which thou gave us
[2:12:40] me I have given them that they may be
[2:12:43] one even as we are one what a journey
[2:12:49] we've taken love not the world nor the
[2:12:52] things of the world in church I tell you
[2:12:54] what because it tells us that I mean
[2:12:56] Peter told us I mean
[2:12:57] tells us that with the love of the
[2:12:58] father's not in us when we do that he
[2:13:00] told us that we got to overcome a mental
[2:13:02] lust of the flesh we got to overcome the
[2:13:04] lust of the eyes and we got to overcome
[2:13:06] the proud of life because that's not of
[2:13:08] the Father it's of the world and see
[2:13:11] even though we go out into this world
[2:13:12] and you know the devil got so much to
[2:13:15] try to offer if it's not something
[2:13:17] physically then he's not trying to offer
[2:13:18] there's something that you're gonna get
[2:13:20] you with your eyes it might be
[2:13:22] monetarily you see
[2:13:24] oh you mean how much money doing what
[2:13:26] waiting but one Sunday that I got a miss
[2:13:28] and pastor Gong understand don't don't
[2:13:32] know so you don't realize every time you
[2:13:35] compromise on that one Sunday the devil
[2:13:38] gonna get you to compromise on another
[2:13:39] Sunday and you'll do it all and for the
[2:13:41] sake of money and it's sometimes not
[2:13:45] Sundays sometimes there's other things
[2:13:47] it's family life that we might have to
[2:13:50] well the devil offered and we sacrifice
[2:13:51] that and we'll be married to our careers
[2:13:53] method rather than married to our wives
[2:13:55] or tough families you got to watch this
[2:13:59] devil in every area of life he's always
[2:14:01] there trying to get you to do something
[2:14:03] that's outside of the will of God if he
[2:14:05] can't get you there then he's gonna work
[2:14:07] with you in popularity let them let them
[2:14:08] let them start pumping your ego just a
[2:14:10] little bit ain't nobody like you you
[2:14:13] don't only one can do this let them
[2:14:15] start pump you and when they start but
[2:14:17] what we're gonna need you to do it on
[2:14:18] this such-and-such a day when my boss
[2:14:23] told me I'm the only one can do it
[2:14:24] pastor well I'm telling you don't no one
[2:14:26] can do what you do here
[2:14:28] so why don't you do it right do it with
[2:14:32] all your heart love not the world the
[2:14:35] things of the world the love of God is
[2:14:37] not in you when you do that let's pray
[2:14:41] father we've taken a journey through
[2:14:44] this this scripture you've given us just
[2:14:47] a three-part series on it and so many
[2:14:50] angles that you've brought it from we
[2:14:52] can see it from the way that we present
[2:14:55] ourselves in this world we're not
[2:14:57] supposed to dress and act like the world
[2:14:58] that's not what you want us to do you
[2:15:00] want us to dress and act like Christians
[2:15:02] but we can see it from the angle of how
[2:15:06] a lot to receive to visitors here
[2:15:11] Abraham had a visitor but the two angels
[2:15:13] went down there to where lot was and
[2:15:15] they they preached the gospel in the
[2:15:17] world they preached it in Sodom God here
[2:15:22] they were lot was a man that was
[2:15:24] considered a man that he really didn't
[2:15:27] enjoy what was happening but he was
[2:15:30] against what was going on down there in
[2:15:31] Sodom but the problem was that he
[2:15:33] couldn't leave it
[2:15:34] he stayed connected to it somehow his
[2:15:37] wife stayed in it and Lord because they
[2:15:39] were so involved in that thing of the
[2:15:41] world God when it was time to come out
[2:15:43] he might not have lost his life but he
[2:15:45] certainly lost his wife and God as we
[2:15:48] even look at it even again today father
[2:15:50] how he fell to the lust of the flesh
[2:15:54] lust of the eyes pride of life she
[2:15:57] failed to these things God but Jesus
[2:15:59] overcame when they were presented to him
[2:16:01] and God as believers we we want to take
[2:16:04] the example of our Lord and Savior Jesus
[2:16:06] Christ and the only way we're gonna
[2:16:08] overcome is by using the word of the
[2:16:13] Lord God help us to apply these things
[2:16:16] that we hear if there's any Lord that
[2:16:19] might be found in this place that's not
[2:16:20] living according to you word got my
[2:16:23] prayers that you would give them a man
[2:16:25] overcoming power you would give them
[2:16:28] strength Lord to rise up based on what
[2:16:31] they've heard of what they've read here
[2:16:32] today that you would give them strength
[2:16:34] Lord to apply that and to see the devil
[2:16:37] defeated in our lives we must be
[2:16:43] overcomers we must be more than
[2:16:46] conquerors
[2:16:46] we must Lord keep that devil under our
[2:16:50] feet we must be victorious when it comes
[2:16:54] to the lust of the flesh when it comes
[2:16:56] to the lust of the eyes and when it
[2:16:58] comes to the pride of life all three of
[2:17:01] these things are used by the enemy to
[2:17:03] pull us further from our God
[2:17:08] help us to be wise help us to be able to
[2:17:11] see God what the devil is trying to do
[2:17:13] in this hour help us so God is my prayer
