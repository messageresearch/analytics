we would be taking a trip to Tucson Arizona and I know it's about 10 or 12 things that I'll be leaving going that weekend brother smiley be coming to preach here the church will still have church for those that like one or two songs to have Church brother smiling to be here and but uh but that'll be coming up to so just keep those things in mind and keep them in prayer let's turn our Bibles it may while you're standing and man everyone stand I can't stand turn in Genesis 15 we want to continue forward with our thought from last week Amen all fourth generation believers a man and just pray that the Lord would just take us a little further and this today Genesis 15 and let's just start reading at verse 13 man Genesis 15 verse 13 and it says and he said into April know of a surety that thy seed shall be a stranger in a land that is not theirs and she'll serve them and they shall afflict them for hundred years now now notice those terms 400 years typically every 40 years is a generation okay so here we're seeing that they would actually be in bondage for ten generations okay they're in bondage for ten generations but I'll watch the scripture a man verse 14 says and also that nation oh they shall serve will I judge and afterwards shall they come out with great substance then you go back and read scripture when they came out of Egypt they borrowed from the Egyptians and they left with great riches and I believe that as we're leaving a man in a rap - we're not leaving broke when I think of poor you know in order to do that right I was just listening to a message - speaking brother branham saying we gotta take care of our little debts alright brother branham say that right don't matter he said like we know about your house and stuff like that but little thank you Oh somebody paid them right pay pay you look this go over to God right but uh but but you know so for us to get our blessing to leave here we gotta take care of what we gotta take care right a man but I believed it as they left Egypt they left with great substance and as we leave the earth will leave with great substance all right might as well start enjoying some of this cuz we gonna be walking streets ago and remember that right asphalt cold concrete though that's that's best what he promised does right hallelujah alright alright the goal is important right when you get gold you know out of the fire like brother Troy told about you gonna be in one fire you think I'd be in the devil's fire you're gonna be in God's fire then we gotta find he's trying to burn the life of God out of you know I gotta find he tryin to put the life of God in you because he wants to see his reflection and that's how to hold a gun I mean that I'm sorry that's how I go we know go let's go when I beat a pizza and you can see your reflection in the gold you know it's good stuff right I'm at first 14 and also that nation oh they should serve will I judge and after what they shall come out with great substance in the first verse 15 and thou shall go to that fathers in peace thou shall be buried in a good old age but in the fourth generation they shall come hither again for the iniquity of the amur assets not yet full now catch that because it was 400 years which would been ten generations but in the fourth generation they come alright but in the fourth generation they shall come hither again for the iniquity of the emirates not yet full a man let's leave it right there y'all can be seated in the presence of the lord and i I won't read all of this I had this so last week a man songs on 24 but I'll just read one verse out of it and you get a chance you can read the whole thing but I'll just read verse 6 they managed Psalm 24 says this is the generation of them that seek Him that seek that face o Jacob Salam a man praise the Lord so you know we're talking about this [Music] amen now you know we can hear them and they can hear us so y'all get louder the priest ring when John saw his name everything inhibit yes everything under the earth everything owner birth hurt John shouting pries is a glory and honor and everything you know when he saw his name so when you see your name when the revelation strike you let let phrase this ringing praise the Lord we got the worst I've been in this church one time they've been and there was a lady down at the at the Dollar General and she was just going to the Dollar General she she heard you know someone who worship she's like what in the world is going on she come from the Dollar General all the way down in here just to see what was happening and she got him here to sound I'm not dressed appropriately so I'm going back home to get some clothes but I'm coming back and she came back praise the Lord that one excuse to get out she actually came back but but but you know what what happens here can impact everything you are little creators and you create the atmosphere you create the center see we spent so much time responding to what the devil is doing let's forget about what the devil do 1 and let's think about what God has good how many glory to God truth I was I was there in the office that's the anointed was just floored through here I was in the office I say Lord yeah give our young people an experience I said when they go to school they always get an experience that they've always got this thing they got that it's the environment that creates the experience sale all day here and there Norton is in the place give the young people that experience even experience make them say why Christians in experience that's the damn because they were all feel hallelujah glory to God hallelujah so we're an expectation church hey man we're under expectation you know I got talking about these fourth generation believers a man because you know how I was just sharing you know just kind of bring you up a little bit there are things that I'm seeing in this generation that I know that I would have never seen before right there are things that are happening and I'm talking about amongst believers a man amongst people that say they believe the message they may not I'm watching things happen and I know and I'm just I'm just looking at a lot of stuff and I thought as I seen as I say Lord that would have never occurred in my generation right I would have never saw a man some of the dances that I see people doing some of the some of the music that people listen to write some of the things that people are doing we would have never even thought to do anything like that hey man you you would never go to a wedding and see dancing praise the Lord hey man hallelujah glory God you will never go and see drinkin I'm just telling you things that I see happening in this generation that would have never happened before right I'll talk about even before we came to them there was a certain amount of holiness right there was holiness we wouldn't dress certain ways certain things on TV we would not look at right but but in this fourth generation in an innocent it's important for me to cry out because you know why there's another generation and after this way and if this generation is not changed then god help us gonna come in the next generation all right raishin does not experience the baptism of the holy ghost god help us so what's gonna happen in the next generation Oh Church all right so let me uh let me just kind of go along here amen I go back actually brothers brother Devon gave me a cool I'm gonna read it this is on the back sheet of paper they're out of an enzyme a man an enzyme and it says this it says an all sickness is caused by sin all sickness is caused by sin that's right before we had sinned we had no sickness seeing our sickness is an attribute of sin right sickness became I mean sickness came because of sin maybe not what you done now think about that youyou could be a man suffering from an illness in your body and you didn't do anything in the kidney but it says it was inherited right you inherited it Amen just by being born in the family that you were born in you inherited something my god but what breaks that is the power of the Holy Ghost since three or four generations it will follow God said so right so you know brother branham's referring back to a man of Scripture here in Exodus 20 and verse 5 they meant Exodus 20 and verse 5 says thou should not bow down thyself to them nor serve them for I the LORD thy God am a jealous God visiting the iniquity of the father's upon the children unto the third and the fourth generation of them that hate me so the slope so when the father's a man get out of place when the father's start walking and disobedience they don't realize that their their steps are impacting generations to follow now you all remember the story a man of brother Branham he shared how this it was Christmastime and the daddy had was going from house to house and his little boy was falling they were snoring all on the ground and they had snow all over the place the boy was following daddy and and as he was going from house to house daddy would just take a little sip of something right and then he go to the next house and he take another little simple son a man and didn't go to the next house and it taking a little sip of something now his boy weren't taking those sins but the daddy was taking six so the daddy got to walk in a manner he got he done got drunk because he been sipping on something a man at every house he went to and as he's walking he's impaired he's impaired he doesn't realize it so it's walking in the soul and he sees a step here and he sees the step there and he doesn't realize it but his boy is walking in his steps and everywhere daddy was step the baller put it and I'm daddy go over here the ball would put his foot and every time that ball would put his foot down the dad and looked around and say why what's the matter with you why are you walking from here to there to there what you doing this walk straight he said daddy I'm following your steps he was selling but pattern for he meant for his son not realizing and when that boy got old enough in the Holy Ghost then I get there and get control of that boy when that boy got old enough he was gonna go from house to house and take a sip and even go to the next house and take a sip and he's gonna go to this house and take a sip the reason I do that is because he saw his daddy and I noticed when that boy has a boy his boy gonna do the same thing he did because it was something that was passed down from generations but the Holy Ghost is able to break whatever speared the devil is trying to pass down through generations now stay with me here a man on this I want to just kind of share a couple things a man if I can oh god help us we were you know so description and I just read here out of our Exodus 20:5 thou should not bow down thyself to them nor serve them for the LORD thy God am a jealous God visiting the iniquity of the fathers of mother children unto the third and fourth generation of them that hate me now let's look at this because I brought this in a few weeks ago hallelujah when we look at a man you know brother Branham gave a quote and let me pull this up the power of the devil let's just look at that real quick then I'm gonna slip back into what something I shared a few weeks ago the power of the devil says look at it in the time of Joseph when God was making manifest the Son of God Jesus Christ through Joseph look how Satan come about the 27th chapter of Genesis there how that Satan come to destroy Joseph and would have done it so the very tool that God was going to use he said Satan's trying to destroy the very tool that's God that God's going to use and I want to just inject Amen to this fourth generation you are the very tool that God wants to use but Satan is trying to destroy you you gotta recognize this the devil you got to know who your enemy is but Satan won't stick I mean Satan wants to destroy the very thing that God wants to use now now stay with me here it says over in chronicles about the 22nd chapter the royal seed how he tried to destroy that and all over in matthew out a second look at matthew - he says look how quickly that Satan was on on the job when he knew it was about the time for the Redeemer to be born he got into the political leaders and set forth an issue and destroyed all the young children from two years Oh down in order to kill the Lord Jesus now you know you have to even think about that what would be the purpose of him going after the children right now you know what if he stopped the parents they couldn't have normal children but why was he going after the children right there's something in the children then they're not I mean who's that up I think Hitler made some type of comment about you know you you give me the music or something like that and I can control the minds of the children a whole generation of children right he said we can just kind of take control of the children that he can do great things in intonation right it's such a thing as always after the children always after particular generation I want I want to go further with this I want to show you all something because we got we gotta hit hit that over into our Genesis 15 again we'll get back to that in a second aid man just stay with me let me just coast a little bit but here you know brother random sense now look back a man look he says uh over in Quran occurs about the twenty seven twenty second chapter the Royal see how he tried to destroy that now let's just let's just go back because I brought this out to you a little bit but when you go back to second chronicles a man chapter twenty two this speaks of a man a lady a ruler at the time by the name of a failure a man and her attempt to actually try to destroy the royal seat right and and and and I'm just going to kind of take you through just a little journey here if we can she tried to destroy the royal seat but only one child was saved and then they keep that child in to you know hide them in the chambers but about six years foot actually brought them forth and let him take his rightful position as king but let's just kind of see something a man as to how he got to that point where a thin he's trying to destroy the royal seat she actually ran for six years she reigned over Israel she was not a man a true daughter of Israel but yet she was ringing Oh Holly Lou god help us here help us here yet she was reigning as a queen up up above God's people now watch this let's let's follow the journey here's how they got there amen so in second chronicles 22 a man is talking about how they were able to save one of the king's son his thing was joash and he was the rightful heir to the throne he was a great-grandson which mean even have been fourth generation he was a great-grandson to King Jehoshaphat now King Jehoshaphat was a very special man he was a godly man right Jehoshaphat if you remember when Ahab call a man job Spencer would you go out with me and and let's go to battle amen and and reclaim my mouth Killian I don't know you got to read your Bible understanding sex right but it's okay if you haven't read your Bible maybe the caused you to go back and read this after we talk about today but but you say sailing let's go let's go and reclaim what God gave us it and they have I mean a handful he said of jobs that say well before we go should we hear the word of the Lord from a prophet hallelujah should we hear the word of the Lord from a prophet and then they answer yeah yeah we should hear from the Prophet I got 400 of them and we're gonna let them prophesy and after they prophesy then we'll go out the back so he brought phone with me before and all of them stood up would say the Lord is with you go out Amen is gonna give you the land and Joseph that heard that John Francaise is there at least one more says at least just walk properly because it's no way that 400 men can prophesy and say the exact same thing trihard so that was a godly may have said yeah yeah there is one more he said but every time I call him he always prophesy evil against me they say say don't let the King say say say so go get the man 11 proper son and here comes my kaya and he proper size and he tell say I see it's real scatter they say hey HAP you're not gonna make it back from battle hey I'm say I told you he was gonna say that right and that's the athletes and Saint Seiya but the man and imprison and I'll deal with him when I get back micaiah say if you come back then I'm not a prophet that you will not make it back from that not sure I'll since I heard that they still went up the ballot in a half died in that battle yes sir hallelujah stay with me here Jehoshaphat was a godly man now I'm talking about his lineage hey man he was a god for your king he wanted to hear the divorce of the Prophet before he went out to battle he also destroyed pagan worship and established a lot Moses as the standard Jehoshaphat wanted to hear Amen the ETR he destroyed pagan worship and he established the law of Moses as to stand up for the people we're trying to establish God's prophet and what he spoke asked the standard for the people listen amen he prayed for deliverance from a mighty host amen to children Moab and the children arm on their distant cousins were coming against him and yeah I mean I'm sorry awesome back pray for deliverance God told him that he wouldn't have to fight in the battle all he needed to do was show up for the battle amen if they were need to fight because God was gonna sent and blood Smiths against the enemy and and after God defeated the enemy for Jehoshaphat they were three days and gathering the spoils he was a man of God now I want you to understand something about him a man it was during this time of jehosophat's rain that a powerful Scripture was recorded and I want to read this to you second chronicles chapter 20 verse 20 a powerful Scripture was record a man doing Jehoshaphat's rain look at this second chronicles 20 and 20 this is where they were recording out the battle they didn't have to fight in the battle God was gonna fight for him all they had to do is just show up listen say their roles early in the morning and went forth into into the wilderness of the cold and as they went forth Jehoshaphat stood and said hear me o Judah and he inhabitants of Jerusalem believe in the Lord your God so shall he be established believe his prophets so surely prosper hallelujah amen the only way to recover prospers by believing what the prophets say Amen somebody that's where your property is this when you believe what the prophets say glory to God so here this powerful scriptures recorded during this time of jehosophat's reign now I'm following him because he's the first generation yes sir now I'm going on because now there was something to happen with all these great things there was one little thing that happened that began to since they sowed the seed that would kind of bring ruination to the people of Judah to the Israelites that were under the reign of the tutor of Judean kings say this with this one thing that he did begin to instead a seed for something that was gonna sprout up later hallelujah amen and what what he did was actually marry his son to Ahab's daughter I want you to catch that Jehoshaphat allowed his son to get married to a Habs daughter all right you want to know who his daughter was a failure so now this father is now within this next generation a man and here's his jobs that son it's called sure Ram of Jehoram a man he's also a king in Judah now where he rose to become king he slew his brothers after his father jobs van pass and man the Bible declared them 2nd chronicles 21 and 13th he married his the daughter of Ahab her name was Italian Italian amen and this was a bad marriage that would impact future generations that's why you gotta watch who you marry this was a bad marriage that was going to impact future generations the children in this relationship think about it we'll have a half and Jezebel as grandparents so so so here Jehoshaphat has allowed his son to link up with a failure now now I caution his grandchildren to be shared with his house and with a hams house a happens marriage to Jezebel which is a really wicked one now can't you imagine sending the kids over to grab my chest man how you gonna stop him from going to Grandma Jesse Bill's house huh you allowed that marriage to take place and now that they're married not connected and not just connected up through friendship cuz you can stop friends from being friends you can block them but when a family oh we may become family it's a totally different story you can't stop the blood right so here you can imagine these kids going to grow my chassis bail and being instructed that girl my Jezebel's house seized that was so while they're hanging with jessie bail watch it now watch watch it look at this hey man I hear a Dahlia was Jezebel Astoria daughter she demonstrated more wickedness than Jezebel she judged enough product to have meatball kill but I'll tell you kill the Royal see right I meant Joe Ranft died with an incurable disease according to a licensed prophecy but in all this wickedness he was allowed to reign because God promised David that he was he would give up give him a son to sit on the throne forever that God made that promise to David even though children was wicked even though he married the wrong woman God was keeping a promise today three children stay with me here he died the next one this is the third generation aha see it comes up amen AHA gia is the is the son of Joh Ram a man and a failure now here's the problem not only was a failure his mother but the Bible says that a tell you became his counselor hallelujah they remember a half's daughter Jezebel's daughter up there is now the counselor to her son who is the king and now you can imagine how they influence of gentle Bell it's passing down everything is passing down now watch this a saya failure was his mother and counselor she counted him to do wickedly the Bible says that his second chronicles twenty two and three he only reigned this man has he only reigned for one year but it was loaned enough to give birth to another king listen the Bible says that he did eat when the silent Lord like the house of Ahab now wow here he is coming on the Jehoshaphat's lineage but it said he did evil like the house of Ahab because a tempest his granddaddy he's being influenced by his granddad his house not his daddy's house so you gotta watch who you just connect to it you see how the state started pack 2 generations now now notice he's only been around for 1 year he was that wicked only been around for one year but he gave birth to a son now the son that he gave birth to a man was not from this was from the daughter of zibeon he gave birth to a son his name was Joe Ash and this is the one that they had to hide inside the temple for so many years a man but in the seventh year Joe ass came out he began to reign glory to God he was reigning as a seven year old king he was responsible for helping to repair the house of God according to second second chronicles 24 - but this man joash is now what we call the fourth generation hallelujah and as a fourth generation Israelite from Jehoshaphat it seemed he only served God while the priest Johanna was living when you read his story this man only served God because of the experience he had with a priest and here's what I mean the young people understand this is why I promise here God does not have grandchildren God only has sons and daughters so every one of us have to have our own experience with God you can't go to heaven because your momma went to heaven you can't go because daddy went to heaven you gotta have your own experience with God's God don't have grandchildren he only have sons and he only has taught us hallelujah somebody can I go a little further here all right listen so answer answer as a as a fourth-generation Israelite from Jehoshaphat he only served God while Yahaira the priest was living was Johanna died he turned to idolatry he even killed to hide a son who prophesied against him he died this man joyous also died on a sick bed and his servants conspired to kill him and I noticed also in the Scout joash even though he's in the lineage of the kings this man was in the lineage of either bringing Jesus Christ to the earth but when you look at it Amen in the Matthew 1:8 his name is not listed this man joash was in the lineage of Jesus Christ but his name was not listed because of the wickedness because of the evil that was done his name was not listed and there were others that did not have their name listed even though they were in the lineage now watch that watch that watch I want to just kind of show some things the other thing that happened during this time of Josh's reign as the 4th generation he turned he turned the children of Judah because they were splitting an Israeli had Judah he turned the children Judith any half misleading a man Israel Jehoshaphat was leaving Judah ain't having Jezebel had already brought in idolatry to Israel but here Judah was still holding on but now because of this marriage and generations later now we see Judas turning from God as well yes it happened in the fourth generation it happened in the fourth generation let me just kind of throw a couple other things at you 4th generation I'm talking about this but if you even at the church ages the darkest age up here Amen was a five-tier in church age and that happened to be the fourth church Inc amen and I want you to understand another thing about five-tier being the fourth church in Thyatira the name actually meant the name Thyatira meant dominating female dominated female brother Branham said that was the worst curse that the world ever had when they got a dominating female now if we're really honest with ourselves right we can see that dominating female spirit coming in again because when a dominated female female spirit they can't be told nothing no respect for leadership and if you go back to type it look at gently male look at Etherea no respect for leadership no much swim that same spirit got released full generation in the Bible now we see in the church age that same thing for church age most Dark Age yes sir and the dominated female sphere was released I won't bring another one brother Troy it gave me discipline think about this after God had destroyed the earth with rain Noah was on the boats and his family was on the boat but but for four generations from Noah a man his great-grandson it would've been or it would have been whammed hilary cush then we would have had nimrod hallelujah and when we look at nimrod a man we can see that the world just end up the complete chaos in the fourth generation hallelujah in the case of Jehoshaphat all the way down to Josh they ended up in complete chaos now I want to read something now to program your church age about Nimrod fourth-generation things happen that's why we got to understand now I'm counting from a specific period I'm actually counting from when a prophet comes on the scene yes sir Noah was a prophet right and look at three four generations later look at what happens amen to his seat look at them right now I want you I want you to catch this because this is coming out of burning me at church age I want you to watch this Roberto makes a statement says Babel his original name for Babylon it means confusion right said it was literally started by cush Belleville was started by cush right then I noticed this curse did not get all the credit that member I got right but but it was started by cush to the ideas the thoughts Amen all that started in the third generation but now we see a manifestation of those thoughts in the fourth generation oh my God my God my god I wish I could just kind of you know whenever we look at this we look at this you know there were things like I've told you last week that we said a third generation say when I get older I'm not gonna raise my kids like that yeah do not get old imma do this and I would do that I'm I'm not going to do this with my kids and don't you realize that the devil was a Norton you way back they can I cannot you know they're things that you know I'm gonna tell you we compromise sometimes in the third generation yes yes I've heard this I've heard this statement from a lot of people a lot of people I've lots in the third generation I'm telling my generation one that one of the things that we said was that I've heard people say they're louder kids and do certain things in the house because they don't want them doing out the house right and it's it I don't want to lose them well let me ask you a question with what they doing in your house ain't they already lost and well if they die right now will they go to heaven or hell now they not going to heaven because they in your house they going to heaven because they ain't Christ right amen but but we but sometimes we compromise durjan I'll tell my third-generation right it's not love to allow them to sit in the house that's not love I mean even Joshua had to take a stake and save me and my house we don't stir below now if you're gonna live in this house you're gonna have to serve them to you don't wanna serve you can go get your house that's right but don't even think about going the way you were in 18 it can't get no child I got to pay for you and since it's my responsibility to pay for you then you're gonna serve the God that I serve X I just want you to fake it like your luck just fake it because when you go out to the world you fake it people know you're Christian but you gotta try to act like you wanna do hello somebody in church and pull your pants up but when you get this food you pull your pants huh you faking it glory to God sister change the clothes faster she leave home she left home with a skirt on but then you catch her side she got pants so she painted it and when she with the girls she feel real good but just let somebody walk by one of the same reason her sister didn't know we were there you better watch it you can't go everywhere like that then never set you up welcome to Walmart and the sister I know she suck she won't dress right and she saw me me I said she just gotta look like she with a friend listen I want right up to ya [Applause] god bless you I want them to know that you live in another world and unity between two worlds you won't have to make a decision one day yes can I tell you a little secret I heard a prayer request here this morning I hear very quick well yesterday yeah I'm just out of nowhere hey what are you supposed to happen my wife was that she volunteers at this place that most of us feel don't know nothing about it what's the call yes yes the affiliation just volunteer and they have the stick to all these activities going on and and she's just there and she could ready to leave she can't leave she's like okay god I gotta go again you know got some things we got to take care of so I got to go and she said well before I go let me just go on this side over here and she walks on another side one day spoke over there won't soak the other side [Music] st. really up this brief you can't go nowhere pounds on you them handles all yeah y'all I gotta win giveness people you don't have to worry about it right we don't got we don't have to compromise for the next generation so that we don't know sir all that the father's giving me will come and you know what is his promise that he will not lose one okay what they do okay with it God says it's not me that keeps them I gotta keep an environment for them but I'm not the one keeping you the Holy Ghost look you cuz when you leave my house do you have something on the inside that account you to love God more than you love the things of the world so we let down some of the standards in the third generation right we let them down a little bit but by seeing that's why the fourth generation is impacted by it yes amen it's very hard you can't you can't you can't you know kind of keep in mind everybody's presence and things like that thing they got to go around family go see fancy little friends they gonna see things and all that's gone right but just make sure you upholding Christ making decisions that's gonna glorify God you know let it deal with a conscience yes cuz they got one yes let me let let it deal with it come and I used to do the same thing pick my mom against my daddy I knew daddy was a little lenient daddy chemicals daddy can I do this I want to go to that prom so bad mama said no but I knew daddy daddy once serving the Lord other daddy could I can I could I get there you know to the prom and dad has sent me out there he said yes son and I went up there mama go to church now dad was ill a man like he would sleep then I wake you up I want to go I got act then then I got me a date I got everything set up and I ain't got no money my daddy said my internet promised a certain go ahead I was just bothered him like I don't know what he's finally let me go and they said that ain't got no money I need some money I gotta take the girl out to eat daddy gave me $10 bill hopefully no tip and i'ma drink water that's all I can do and I got to the prominent and then you know one of the fellas knew I was a little mad something wrong with Jack what's Jack what's the matter man it's a man look man my daddy gave me $10 man I ain't got no money man they going to eat man I can't take this girl to eat man I don't know what I would do you said jack know where I got $50 Oh God answers prayer [Music] what God know how to situate us to move and do our cameras the asphalt and in church that night they would have a church that Friday night and Here I am trying to bust a move that's why the thing I got the finger knowledge we got sixty all three us gonna eat we gonna look good then I won thank you they say when we going to eat they say wax when you walk into the restaurant to get to your table my past his wife and the Saints that just left Church sitting right there and I'm coming from the prop and when I walk to the rest of the Sun at I turned around and went back outside they say Jack what's the matter nothing nothing nothing Jack what come you won't come in y'all just don't understand you don't get it I just can't say hi to him now you understand I've been busted see they went the pen I mean they were in the Baptist churches it didn't matter to them they say hi to the past I went to Holiness Church and I knew that was wrong when I got busted it did something funny parents let your kids get busted experience that they will have will stay with them for a lifetime in Turkey put them in the Nile River and let them get busted forgive me a churchy let me read this for you I'm coming Noah ham cush Nimrod Babel is the original name for Babylon it means confused and it was literally started by cush the son of ham but was brought to a kingdom of power and grandeur under his son nimrod the mighty hunter right now i understand when they call this man the mighty hunter he wasn't going out killing animals he was hunting nations hunting people right right and he was trying to destroy nathan a conquered nations that's why he's called the mighty hunter all right notice mighty hunter nimrod according to the Genesis 11 account and also according to profane history set out to accomplish three things now now notice I want you to catch this because nimrod represents 4th generation so there's something that happens in the 4th generation and watch this spear three things that happen in Iran Nimrod once the three things that happen here today look look he wanted to build a strong nation which he did he wanted to propagate his own religion right so he's not following the Prophet he got something new that he want to bring right amen what the Prophet said is not good enough and then we go further than the Prophet that's what they say in the fourth generation right right and they didn't go further in Arak that's against the work say say he wanted to propagate his own religion which he feared and he wanted to make a name for himself you know preaching amongst the bright weren't good enough I know what I'm talking about man I already found it in the message brother branham let me know what this spirit is so being amongst a bright weren't good enough the crowds not larger night the church is not large enough there's a little bit more attention if I can get on stage right here I get myself a little bit more exposure on YouTube if I can just get much I need to make a name for myself because the name I got amongst these little churches ain't big enough I want to play for this church I got a talent I got a gift I can play for that church and if I if I got up on stage in that church just think about all the people that I can impact oh you ain't you ain't you yeah I mean you gotta talk to me I know what I'm talking about let me tell you something you talking to one that was damn I worked in I work in that environment have you prayed about coming to join up with us then what never really tell me have you thought about shutting down your church and becoming a part of this church look at how grand we are look at how big we are we can make you a pastor I'm already a pastor I'm already a pastor right because I wouldn't actually a man fall for it Amen I went full-time in ministry read between the lines but if God is for you then we'll give me again I took my stain and I stay with the Word of God and God has been blessing everybody's the church spiritually financially emotionally physically plexus miracle after miracle because somebody took the stand for the word but the fourth generation sees it as an opportunity mem rocks right so that's an opportunity see so you see his daddy introduced polytheism it used to be just one God everybody believed in one God it was a monotheistic religion one God but but cush begin to bring in hardly see yourself right polytheistic I mean here you got multiple gods so so he take that teaching it to the son and now his son is taking it to another level all right stay with me amen we believe used to believe be baptized the name of Lord Jesus Christ now third unit I mean fourth generation going so many baptized the name of Father Son and Holy Ghost they move move from monotheism to polytheism that happens in the fourth generation man notice now I'm bringing this out I'm showing this to you and let me just finish reading this quote because I got to come back around because not everybody the fourth generation gonna get company I'm swinging right now for you okay just let me finish read this quote saying they say Nimrod according to Genesis 11 account and also according to profane history set out to accomplish three things he wanted to build a strong nation if I can just put it this way build a strong denomination there I'm a strong nation which you did not now not just because somebody say they are nondenominational that don't mean they following the work we will talk about that and some school day it's not just believe the Bible or oh we can put it this way man you gotta believe the word it's not just that either it's believed though we're word for you're not just the word but the reveal word for your you gotta know what say you living in you're not living in Noah's day so ain't no stinson nobody coming to build a little boat time I get on we're not getting no work we don't believe that I mean it was in the word that's already gone by we not we not following that no more amen we use it as an example right yes but you gotta believe the word for your days who's the Prophet fit your date and God almost in one guys to have proper step a quarter to Ephesians there are some apostles some prophets some evangelists some teachers some Pat yeah we believe that - yes amen and people want to get what a chicken Thomas me as a prophet let me tell you something let me tell you something right now if we have to acknowledge you like that I doubt you a prop somebody have to give you tight that type of credibility you got a bag for it something wrong with your experience you know the Bible say a man's guilt make room for itself whether they acknowledge it Dom acknowledge it you'll give still gonna make new person and nobody got to do nothing extra for you let me show you what the real deal is this is what you're going after he wanted a car set out to accomplish three things he wanted to build a strong nation which he did he want to propagate his own religion which he did he wanted to make a name for himself which he also accomplished his accomplishments were so monumental that the kingdom of Babylon was called the hand of gold amongst all world governments that his religion gained prominence and proven by the fact that scripture identifies it would say you did all that but your ministry identified with see actually anointed by the devil oh maybe the devil can use you in church you know you know there's a lot of folk go to church week in and week out and don't realize that they worship in the devil right in church I'm telling you right I mean you know when it comes down to church is that it's got to come back to regular word for you see you really not worshiping in spirit and in truth yeah yeah it's because the father looking for he looking for people that's gonna worship in spirit and in truth some horse have been spirit but don't have true so I've got the truth ain't got no spirit yeah but he won't spirit and man and that's this just so happened to be on Church name right but but that's not what I'm talking I'm not talking coming to this building alright I'm talking worshiping in spirit but with a revelation whining worship all right amen all right so he goes on to say this he says that his religion game promised is proven by the fact that scripture identifies it it was Satan completely in Isaiah chapter 14 and in Revelation chapter 17 through 18 and by history we can prove that it invaded the whole world and is the basis for every system of idolatry and the theme of that Ana theme the theme of mythology through the name though the names of the gods different various sections of the land according to the language of the people that he made a name for himself and as follows goes without saying for as long as this present age goes home until Jesus reveals himself to his brother he will be worshipped and honored through under though under different name from Nimrod and in a temple slightly different from the one in which he was originally adorned all right now I'm bringing that church because oh my goodness you know we we need to we need to see we need to see that same spirit has come and hit the Fortuner reach that's right that's right reach it's hit the fourth-generation and I have to count from a profit notice what I went when I gave you Genesis 15 and I went a little circle background hit this and then I'll try to close it today but Genesis 15 and verse 13 it says instead of an April know of a surety that that seat should be strange in the land that is not theirs and shall serve them in Asia afflict them for hundred years that represents ten generations four hundred years would actually represent ten generations right now when you skip down to verse 16 it says but but yes in the past generation they shall come hither again for the iniquity of the ever race is not yet full right now notice that now they're gonna be there for for ten generations right ten generations they've been punished but in the fourth generation and the reason that we got what we see is that it's the fourth generation from a prophet the fourth generation from when Moses hit the scenes now now now now now you know when we get this because they did not come back into the promised land until Moses that come on the scene he started it but he didn't actually take them into the Promised Land right now no monist Moses would have represented the first generation right shots when Caleb and the generation that died in the wilderness would have been the second Amen generation right but the third generation a man is those that were born in the wilderness hallelujah they were born in the woods they would have been that third generation but notice amen they would have been the ones that go into it but by the time it got to the fourth generation and they would have been experienced a blitz of the promise thing but also this was the one that would have gone into judges apostasy because in the book of Judges every man did what was right as oh nice but I need you to catch something in the scripture about the fourth generation this is why I go back to the scripture and you got to know who you are yes because the scriptures say this is the generation that seeks him now you're not because what I'm says that even as I'm preaching this if you've got a revelation you say brother Jack I understand what you're saying I get it I follow I'm not a part of that group all right that's going off into a pasta yes I understand it with the word in my generation and the reason I say that notice this notice is verse 16 watch it again but in the fourth generation they shall come hither again for the iniquity of the Amorites is not yet full so what it tells us that in the fourth generation iniquity tamaracks was gonna get full it was gonna be I mean in iniquity animal rights they were doing things that was so displeasing to God that God had to kick them out of the land but it was also in that generation that they would possess the land but when that happens is the fourth generation that goes into the land [Music] Church I tell you what God got great things for the fourth generation and Inga's realizes this is this is yeah this is a generation where a lot of stand a lot of stuff happening that that shouldn't happen but it's also the generation that's fully I'm in they supposed to enjoy the greatness of God like no other generation they matter this is that generation that seeks him so that's why I counted from the profit I counted the profit his first generation I counted my parents would have a second generation I counted myself third generation but my children would be four generation a man we have to look at it from the angle of property look at Noah Noah was a prophet started with him then it went to him then it went the goods didn't went to Morocco all these things happen in the fourth generation but can I just read your promise I read it before I must read it again I don't need future change this is for you fourth generation believers hallelujah I'm not leaving you out there it's not just gonna come up here blast in another long till it's unfortunate reason believers go they can experience some great names they're trying to build a name for themself all right then I'll stay right here with this word gotta make you everything you need to be right here glory amen man look at this this is your promise revelation 2 4 nevertheless I have somewhat against thee because thou has left that first love to understand this you must realize that the Spirit is not speaking to the original Saints of Ephesus alone who says this message is to the entire age which lasted about a hundred and twenty years its message then as to all the generations in that span now history keeps repeating itself in the generations of Israel we see revival in one generation only to see the fires fading in the next and the third generations embers maybe glowing slightly but in the fourth there may be no vestige whatsoever of that original flame can I just stop because they know no vestige whatsoever of the original thing you know it's in the fourth generation then we begin to have this question while we got a call to prophet yes y'all say a man if you want to why we gotta quote the Prophet that question only came up in the fourth generation well you know we just sit with the prophecy just sing with Jesus sing but we gotta cool the Prophet one of my friends told me you know and she just you know fell to tell me that just preach what Jesus said don't listen no no no no you misunderstand you misunderstand what's going on here say just like Joshua grows up here to say of what Moses said I'm we rise up and say that prophet go back to Joshua 1 they they they held on to what Moses saying they could not come out of Egypt without move and we want to come out of denominations it got this why you gotta know no you understand you realize you wouldn't be where you at right now if you want to listen to a prophet you wouldn't be where you at man you got some time you gotta remember where God brought you from you'd be the president of a donor Club huh hey man they make you some title over there and everybody want to tell everybody walk through the church need a title yeah why can't I mean I was somewhere recently maybe just keeping all these title I say I say titles I'm just I'm brother Jack I'm just brother Jack that's who that's all I am I don't need no time I don't even live in it this is my cousin I'm gonna speak on his behalf I'm just brother Jack so I got the talking just a little bit I'm just giving you know some on to my cousin everything and I think might have took about five minutes I left which winner sat down and they come in super handy I need to cut want to invite you to my church to preach so I'll just talk for five minutes I'm not trying to be nothing we don't see how much tell you something you don't know you might not understand it but it's there Norton that is over that set you apart they will want you just because of what you said I never heard it put together like that I mean it is because I like the brothers here we got to stay lined up but we got our sights set hallelujah got Trotec yeah you got your Bible but you gotta have that other future that you're looking at your back cuz you can look at your Bible through a theological silver-gilt but I'm looking at through a prophetic filters hallelujah that certain scriptures if I came to you when I understand you go try to get somebody's material try to understand this scripture but right don't get somebody that has not been vindicated take a profit live it up get your sights set you'll hit the turkey but in this generation that the original flame even the how we got here that original flame is going out hallelujah that's right let's read the rest of the course was already ahead of me he already had he already got yes they already gathered again because you know my brother told me saying I went swimming at throw in there when the when the embers I'm going out in a fire so what happened was that people walk up to me just they blow up yeah and what it does is start a fire over here now right and this is why this is why we've been talking about the Holy Ghost because Jesus and you say receive ye the Holy Ghost right so so so that's why the holy girls been pouring that we've been preaching it talking about that Holy Ghost coming in and I would say you don't want to just come on you he wants to come and when he comes by just let him in open up the door of your heart and let him II generation I love cuz when the Prophet put does he say he say he's saying up the messages to the entire age would last about 120 years its message to install generations then that's been out history keeps repeating self in the generation of Israel we see revival one generation only see the fire Satan in the next in the third generation enemas maybe glowing slightly but in the fourth there may be no vestige whatsoever of that original flame and I like this because this is a promise this this statement right here is prophecy this is what I'm looking for this is restoration this is delivery hallelujah so no matter what you see right now it's not gonna stay in that condition all you saw was a fourth generation process but the Prophet says then God so when it gets like this the ink on you know you don't have brother branham totally say say sometimes in your darkest hour ha ha ha and your caucus hour when you are tossed on the river I own the lake and don't know how you gonna get is dawna conditions all around huh anything like that big cheese's comes walking on the ward safe they say checkmate when you're done it's our then Jesus comes so here in our darkest hour in the fourth generation we see the sphere of what the devil is duck let's whip all hell breaks loose we have a promise that all heaven will also break loose then God likes the fire can hallelujah church that fell among expectation for the same generation that saw the iniquity of the amorite get fool yeah it's the same generation that possesses the promise leanness the promised land in the Holy Ghost oh y'all ain't seen nothing yet for generation y'all ain't seen nothing yet this is the generation that sees him that seek thy face o Jacob some says the same process is repeated simply the manifestation of truth that God has no grandchildren salvation is not passed on by natural birth anymore them it is there any truth to apostolic succession it is it isn't in the word you start out we're truly going to give believers and when the next generation comes along they're no longer just plain Christians but they have taken a denominational name and are now Baptist Memphis etcetera that's exactly what they are - they are not Christians you have to be born of the will of God not the will of man to be saved but these folks are all coming together now by the will of man I don't say that some of them aren't right with God not for a minute do I say that but the original fire has died down they are not the same anymore he goes on the fervent desire to please God the passion to know his word the cry for reaching out in the spirit see that when we come to church with you have a fervent desire hey man every generation yes younger sa-do's don't be ashamed to praise God I talked about the one that put breath in your body Oh gave you the activity of your Linh so don't be ashamed of praise thank God you got a voice too priest then the FIR out I remember man one time I head up and got cancer in the throat and to say he couldn't he couldn't eat anymore you see you alone to just go to a Burger King and just grab a Walkman eat it but he couldn't because of the effect that we're having just imagine you not being able to do things you used to do so why you got the activity give God everything fervent desire to please God the passion to noise word the cropper reaching out in the spirit all begins to fame and instead of that church being on fire with the fire of God it hasn't cooled off and become it has cooled off and become a bit formal that is what's what was happening back there to the Ephesians they were getting a bit full the abandonment to God was dying out and the people weren't too careful about what God thought of them as they began to be careful about what the world thought of them see love not the world or the things of the world because the love of God wouldn't be any of you do that right so we don't care what the world thinks we want it we want to care about what God is that second generation coming always just like Israel they demanded a king to be like the other nations when they did that they rejected God but they did it anyway that is the history of the church when it thinks more of conforming to the world instead of conforming to God it isn't long until you see them stop doing the things they used to do no tell me I don't tell me soon as the person leave this business and it don't take them a good mind holding the standard is god yes let me just finish someone when I'm coming over right here I'm leaving he says oh my god Lord Jesus you know I was telling you last week that it was brother Branham saw the bride get out of stem and when she got under steps she was dancing same thing we see in church people doing the dance it might not be at church but it might be at a wedding they dancing brother branham saw that and he yelled get back and step right right he said when he saw that second group coming in i'ma tell you what brother Graham said he said son a second group the second preview the bride you say they came in with no makeup right the bride had no makeup when brother Branham started when they got back in Stephanie to come to me I'm just telling you what what the bride look like in the vision right Church I mean we got to get back can I see things come to be in creeping in we want to get closer to God don't bring that in God delivered us from men right so I'm gonna go back to what God deliver us from I mean I used to move like that when I was in the world I'm not going back to that I used to listen to songs like that when I was in the world I'm not listening to that boy hallelujah Church look at this he goes on to say this these things I'm just I'm sitting the man of the King to be like the other nations when they did they did to protect it God but they did it anyway that is the history of the church when it thinks more of conforming to the world instead of conforming to God it isn't long until you see them stop doing the things that used to do and start doing things they wouldn't do initially they've changed their manner dress I tell me that ain't the truth they've changed their manner of dress the dresses get shorter title I see young you know it's not a young man not supposed to have long hair trying to description for our african-american brothers what is long hair is it dress or is it an afro I'm telling a really really big afro what is what is long hair see I mean you know cuz there are some haircuts that are not of God some of them are actually of the world what nationality you are matt cutts not from guys you identify with people in the

that's not round in the corners of you hate it man I'm gonna say that's what it means but you know you think about it but it does say something round in the corners of your head there in Old Testament praise the Lord it's in there now you might have a different interpretation oh so you do what you feel but keep your hair cut but you see your medicines as soon as they as soon as they leave the word

another Christian you've got that be somebody in the world and you want to introduce these amen Church right but these are the things episode so you know oftentimes people that struggle in those areas can I just be honest yeah I know I'm over time I'm sorry but he went struggle in those areas that's why I sneeze for them to go to church that allow them to do that yeah ain't gonna preach about that over here yeah you're right you're right being they gonna tell you a lot of things over there yeah show take your money yeah and also taking ale all right I'm moving on I'm coming to a close they demanded the King to be like the other nations when they did that they rejected God but they did it anyway that is history of the church when it thinks more conformed to the world instead of conforming to God it isn't long until you see them stop doing the things they used to do and start doing things they wouldn't do initially they wouldn't do initially they change their man address their attitudes huh notice notice oh it is that change they change their man address their attitude and their behavior Oh y'all used to talk tonight I come you know you don't put me down I put you down you put me down Yeah right they attitude because they see what's to reason the elkay talkin about cuz you can't talk about the time they attitude that change so did you say the prophecy told their attitudes their behavior look at this one they get lacks is he saying he say what'd he say sound good it what I do I know I'm good he say but if I get complacent right now walking in I do something say just gonna be a greasy spot where our stand they won't even find his body been absorbed by elements they get lakhs that is what emphasis mean relaxed and drifting why I tell you what I can keep reading forever but I just want you to see that in the fourth generation I'm not leaving you completely out there's a lot of things that we can see according to scripture when we look at Moses the children of Israel then we're coming out and they made it to the promised land that then they got next and they ended up you know in the book of Judges but if you read the book of Judges God just kept coming back and lighting the fire again kept coming back like the fire again and one-time aspiring to get lit it's gonna stay late and we got the word by that cycle anymore right you know no one knows they oven or ham cush Nimrod they went into apostasy but you just look at those things I've talked about a jaw Safed all the way down a joash and it went to apostasy but we can break that cycle yeah we can break that cycle now we have an understanding of what the devil is doing in this hour wants to the covers been pulled off on their skin let's defeat that down and the biggest thing greatest thing best thing we can do is press into the Holy Ghost and to make your shout let it make you shout make you cry let it make you cry they make you stop let it be that long as you get it that's what man is a man we need mo Holy Ghost we leave Ohana chimera amen this is the generation that seeks that face of Jacobsen live that's who we are let's pray father we're so appreciative of the word the devil is exposed we know just what he is doing his attack his tactics Lourdes tricks my god what an attack on the 4th generation and Lord as the problem was saying sometimes there are things that happen not even they don't even realize but it sins that happened in generations before them now they are under the attack of sins that were not covered under the blood years before father my prayer is that as we recognize this that we would press more and more into the Holy Ghost realizing how much more we needed God how it keeps us how it sustains us how it protects us how it Lord just provides the shelter that we need for the hour which we live though the enemy come in like a flood the Spirit of God will raise the standard and God the standard that is raised is having the word quickened to us and as that word is quickened and made alive to his God we begin to walk according to him Jesus Jesus we need more of you God we need more of you God help us Lord Jesus to draw closer you told us if we draw him out of you that you would draw mad at us we ask it in the mighty name of Jesus amen amen brother Solomon he would come and disclose the sound of today I think the song is
