[45:50] God bless you Saints always good to be
[45:51] in the house of the Lord turn with me to
[45:53] Ephesians chapter 6 we'll have an
[45:56] opening script there and then we'll
[45:58] spend most of our study our lesson in
[46:01] First Kings chapter
[46:04] 22 I always uh appreciate the
[46:07] opportunity to be here it's a lot of uh
[46:11] um it takes a lot for our pastor to just
[46:13] open up his pulpit and so there's a
[46:15] great deal of respect that I acknowledge
[46:18] just standing behind this sacred desk so
[46:20] I don't bring my own thoughts I just
[46:22] bring God's words to you amen so
[46:25] appreciate brother Jack in the assembly
[46:27] here we always feel welcome we always
[46:29] feel at home so Ephesians chapter
[46:35] 6 Ephesians chapter
[46:39] 6 this will not be our essential part of
[46:42] of our lesson but just wanted to kind of
[46:45] use it as a foundation so Ephesians 6
[46:50] verse2 it says for we wrestle not
[46:53] against flesh and blood but against
[46:55] principalities against Powers against
[46:57] the rulers of the darkness of this world
[47:00] against spiritual wickedness in high
[47:03] places wherefor take unto you the whole
[47:06] armor of God that ye may be able to
[47:09] stand in the evil day and having done
[47:12] all to stand amen verse 14 stand
[47:18] therefore having done all to stand hold
[47:21] your ground amen having your loins gir
[47:24] about with truth and having on the
[47:27] breastplate of righteousness now let's
[47:30] jump over to First
[47:33] [Music]
[47:35] Kings it's a scripture that we have made
[47:38] reference before but as I when I study
[47:40] something and a little bit more just
[47:42] gets opened up to me I just feel like I
[47:43] just want to revisit it so First Kings
[47:46] chapter
[47:47] [Music]
[47:50] 22 say Amen if you're there amen all
[47:53] right we'll read the first five verses
[47:56] and I'll let you have your seats and it
[48:00] says and they continued 3 years without
[48:04] war between Syria and
[48:07] Israel and it came to pass in the third
[48:10] year that Jehoshaphat the king of Juda
[48:13] came down to the king of
[48:15] Israel and the king of Israel said unto
[48:18] his servants know ye that rth and Gilead
[48:23] is ours and we be still and take it not
[48:27] out of the hand of the king of
[48:30] Syria and he said unto Jehoshaphat wilt
[48:34] thou go with me to battle to ramth
[48:38] Gilead and Jehoshaphat said to the king
[48:41] of Israel I am as thy art my people as
[48:44] thy people my horses as thy
[48:48] horses and Jehoshaphat said unto the
[48:51] king of Israel inquire I pray thee at
[48:55] the word of the Lord today may the Lord
[48:59] have his blessings to the reading of the
[49:01] word you may enjoy the Comforts of your
[49:02] seats as o preacher says as I remain
[49:08] standing amen amen you know we're we're
[49:12] living in a a moment now where we need
[49:16] to take a stand yes sir yes regardless
[49:20] of what we are confronted with
[49:22] regardless of what we are faced with
[49:25] yeah we need to take a Gallant
[49:28] standard and if there's ever a
[49:31] time um there's never been a time like
[49:34] this time now where your faith as a
[49:37] Christian will be
[49:39] tested what you believe right why you
[49:43] believe the way you believe the purpose
[49:45] of why you believe the value of what you
[49:48] believe and that testing is going to
[49:52] come in many forms and Fashions
[49:56] sometimes might be in your face other
[49:59] times it might be really subtle right so
[50:02] we must be very wise and understand the
[50:04] trickery of the devil because remember
[50:07] the devil is not some ugly thing with
[50:10] the two-headed with a with a with a with
[50:12] two horns and you know that that's what
[50:15] the world would have you to believe the
[50:17] Bible says he comes to you as an angel
[50:18] of Light so he looks
[50:22] good he looks
[50:24] attractive sin feels that
[50:28] way praise the
[50:31] Lord and uh so we realize that we're in
[50:35] a battle and so we must be guarded
[50:37] because the devil he doesn't come at you
[50:41] as uh he doesn't approach us as a peanut
[50:44] butter spread but he approached all of
[50:48] us as
[50:49] individuals so one thing that might be a
[50:51] fault for you might be a strength for
[50:53] somebody
[50:54] else something that might be a strength
[50:57] for somebody else might be a fault for
[50:58] someone else so we must be always uh uh
[51:02] we must be always guarded around our
[51:05] weaknesses and say Lord you know my
[51:07] strength and you know my weaknesses and
[51:10] the devil knows your strength and he
[51:12] also knows your
[51:14] weakness now it's not a shame to fall
[51:18] don't get
[51:19] quiet but it is shameful to stay while
[51:22] you're falling
[51:24] down because we were built to get back
[51:28] up you were built you were conditioned
[51:31] not only to take a punch but to
[51:33] withstand any storm that comes your
[51:36] way and the storms will come your way
[51:40] I'm not talking about a wind that's
[51:41] blowing here and there I'm talking about
[51:43] a hurricane five
[51:45] storm but whatever doesn't kill me makes
[51:48] me
[51:50] stronger the fact that you're here this
[51:52] morning only proves to the devil that
[51:54] God has given you the victory you could
[51:57] have sat there and laid in bed but you
[51:59] chose by God's grace to come to church
[52:01] and that in itself is a
[52:04] victory
[52:06] hallu take a
[52:09] stand and so we find and I'm not going
[52:12] to keep you too long but I love this
[52:13] lesson right here because there's just
[52:14] so many thoughts there between the story
[52:17] with Ahab and let me give you some
[52:18] background to First Kings and we we
[52:20] spend a lot of time the whole chapter
[52:22] mainly on First Kings 22 but to give you
[52:25] some background Ahab was married to uh
[52:28] uh
[52:30] Jezebel and uh he wanted nebo's a
[52:35] Vineyard and so cuz the vineyard that
[52:38] was in chapter 21 The Vineyard was right
[52:39] next to uh ahab's uh Palace and so Ahab
[52:43] looked at the P looked at the vineard
[52:45] like that's a beautiful garden I could
[52:47] really I could it would be nice for me
[52:49] to have that Garden so he goes to naboth
[52:51] and he says hey naboth um can I have the
[52:54] vineyard in naboth being
[52:56] a God-fearing man he says look I prayed
[52:59] about it and uh this is my uh
[53:01] inheritance and I can't just give it to
[53:03] you you know The Audacity Of The Devil
[53:06] he just want to take things from you
[53:07] right and sometimes we willingly give it
[53:11] up but we got to pray about if God gives
[53:13] you something it's your inheritance the
[53:16] devil has no right to what God has given
[53:19] youen thank you Lord amen and so Ahab
[53:24] didn't like uh nebo's response so he was
[53:27] down in the dumps and he was kind of all
[53:30] you know he wouldn't eat bread and you
[53:32] know he was just kind of the wowy Woos
[53:35] as brother Drew would say and so uh
[53:37] Jezebel gets home and looks at her
[53:40] husband it's like what's wrong with you
[53:42] and he's like well you know I went to
[53:44] naboth and I wanted the vineyard and he
[53:46] says no and she looks at him and and she
[53:50] says well aren't you the king of Israel
[53:53] like you could do whatever you want to
[53:54] do right that's the attitude of the
[53:56] devil all right the devil feels like he
[53:58] could just walk all over you but you're
[54:00] God's Property let me say it again the
[54:03] devil thinks he can walk all over you
[54:06] you got to remind the devil that you're
[54:10] God's
[54:11] Property you're not just anybody's
[54:13] property you're God's
[54:14] Property God has authority over you God
[54:17] has watchful eye over
[54:20] you and through some uh uh through some
[54:25] cunningness and through
[54:27] some uh um
[54:29] trickery um Jezebel
[54:33] forges Ahab
[54:35] signature and orders the death of naboth
[54:40] yeah Elijah gets wind of this and the
[54:45] Lord spoke to Elijah the tishbite and
[54:47] says go to
[54:48] Ahab and uh he prophesies over Ahab and
[54:53] says Ahab
[54:56] God has seen what has happened within
[54:59] your
[55:00] household death has been
[55:04] pronounced and the Bible says when Ahab
[55:06] heard these things he rent his clothes
[55:09] and put on side cloth and fasted and he
[55:11] prayed said Lord forgive me now there's
[55:14] more that I'm leaving out but I'm just
[55:15] laying the foundation here bless the
[55:17] Lord and God told Elijah saying look I
[55:21] have seen that Ahab has humbled
[55:24] himself and because he's done that I
[55:28] will not bring those evil in his days
[55:30] but in the days of his son will I bring
[55:32] those evil Lord so their judgment was
[55:36] laying at the door of Ahab right he was
[55:40] death has been pronounced unto him but
[55:43] because he has repented of his ways it
[55:45] moved upon the heart of
[55:49] God and
[55:51] so we get to verse chapter 22 where we
[55:54] just read
[55:56] there had been in Prior chapters there
[55:59] have been a longstanding war between
[56:03] Syria and Israel and Syria had captured
[56:07] Routh
[56:08] Gilead and so
[56:10] Jehoshaphat which uh was King over Judah
[56:13] because there was a split between Israel
[56:15] and Judah there was uh he was the king
[56:17] over
[56:18] Judah and he represented a lineage that
[56:21] was usually in favor with God and then
[56:24] you had Ahab that represented Israel the
[56:26] king over Israel yeah so they were of
[56:29] the same bloodline if you will but they
[56:31] had two kings that ruled over them were
[56:34] together and so and it came to pass in
[56:37] the third year Jehoshaphat just kind of
[56:39] meandered down and and just said let me
[56:41] go have Fellowship on my brother
[56:44] Israel and the king of Israel was
[56:46] probably sitting there reflect and he
[56:47] says you know ramoth Gilead really
[56:50] belong to
[56:53] us and so when he convinced his servants
[56:58] that we need to go get the territory
[57:00] after three years of Peace he's like you
[57:01] know what I'm going to start some
[57:03] trouble with Syria I'm going to go and
[57:05] take this land that belongs to me and
[57:07] and he probably had good intentions I'm
[57:09] sure and Jehoshaphat happened to be
[57:12] visiting at that
[57:14] time and and he looked at Jehoshaphat he
[57:17] says Jehoshaphat let me uh let me ask
[57:19] you a question you ever thought about
[57:21] rondra the oat probably said no it never
[57:24] occurred to
[57:25] me and let me tell you something be
[57:29] careful who you align yourself with
[57:32] right now right now this Christian walk
[57:37] is an individual
[57:40] Affair it doesn't mean you can't pray
[57:42] for your brother it doesn't mean you
[57:45] can't pray for your sister but the Bible
[57:47] didn't say to them that overcometh the
[57:50] Bible says to him that
[57:52] overcometh the Bible says work out your
[57:54] own salvation with fear and
[57:57] trembling because the Lord reveals
[57:59] something to you doesn't mean that I
[58:01] have something to do with
[58:02] [Applause]
[58:04] it be careful who you're lying
[58:07] yourselves with
[58:08] Saints yes sir and so God spoke to so
[58:14] Ahab believed that he had a a a vision
[58:17] and not necessarily from God but a
[58:19] vision of what he wanted to do and
[58:23] Jehosaphat he says you know we are the
[58:25] same people we of the same message
[58:29] Believers all right we say Amen to the
[58:32] same gospel let me tell you we all need
[58:34] to go through the blood of Jesus Christ
[58:36] just because we sit underneath the
[58:38] banner of this message doesn't mean that
[58:40] we all are
[58:41] saved that's the truth that's the truth
[58:44] I'm not putting I'm not putting anybody
[58:46] in and I'm not taking anybody out I'm
[58:48] just saying you got to walk the line
[58:50] that God has shown to
[58:53] you sir not to someone else your
[58:56] salvation is not dependent upon somebody
[58:58] else being
[59:00] saved God didn't call me for my opinion
[59:02] about you being
[59:05] saved your pastor's obligation is to
[59:07] preach the gospel not to tell God if you
[59:10] can make it or
[59:13] not that decision has been decided by
[59:16] God not now but before the foundation of
[59:19] the
[59:23] world so Jehoshaphat got into it because
[59:27] it sounded like a sound argument you
[59:28] know the devil knows how to make a good
[59:30] argument to persuade you yes Hees you
[59:33] may not have even thought about
[59:34] something and the devil kind of put
[59:36] presents all forms of arguments of why
[59:38] you should do something and why you
[59:40] shouldn't do something and why you
[59:42] should go there and why you shouldn't
[59:44] come to church and why you shouldn't do
[59:46] this the devil knows how to put on a
[59:48] good argument he's been putting an
[59:50] argument from the very beginning yay did
[59:52] God had say all right
[59:56] and Jehoshaphat said my people are your
[1:00:01] people but Jehoshaphat was a little bit
[1:00:03] wise
[1:00:05] too he says now before we get beside
[1:00:07] ourselves because I like where you're
[1:00:08] coming from I I can understand where

[1:02:22] patient hallu let God be magnified in
[1:02:25] all of

[1:02:32] you oh my Lord this is what I've been
[1:02:33] looking for God knows what you need more
[1:02:36] so than you know what you need yourself
[1:02:38] that's right brother praise the Lord
[1:02:41] amen then the king of Israel gathered
[1:02:45] 400
[1:02:48] prophets can you just imagine so the
[1:02:50] king of Israel and Jehoshaphat sitting
[1:02:53] on the throne and Jehoshaphat looks at
[1:02:55] uh AB that you know do you have anybody
[1:02:58] here that we could consult with can we
[1:03:00] get some preachers kind of get some
[1:03:01] spiritual guidance around this me at
[1:03:04] least I'd like to know what thus said
[1:03:06] the Lord has to say about
[1:03:08] it so Ahab like I got you I know 400 men
[1:03:14] they've been this they've been a
[1:03:15] Ministry uh uh they've been a a Ministry
[1:03:18] School for 30 plus years between 400
[1:03:21] prophets and so many years you talking
[1:03:23] about like 500 years of experience I
[1:03:24] mean they they know what to talking
[1:03:26] about they never preach what against
[1:03:28] what I
[1:03:30] believe everything they say I say yes
[1:03:32] and
[1:03:34] amen
[1:03:35] now there is some degree of Truth to
[1:03:38] that because not all the time there were
[1:03:40] false prophets right and I'll get to
[1:03:43] that in a moment right and so they said
[1:03:47] unto him so you know a have you know
[1:03:50] when you know you got your fre favorite
[1:03:51] preacher that's going to
[1:03:53] come people get all excited I am
[1:03:58] right and so Ahab was all excited
[1:04:02] right and so they began to preach
[1:04:05] hollering screaming renting raing all
[1:04:09] right and Ahab was say amen he was
[1:04:11] shouting toing back flips cartwheels
[1:04:13] he's like I love this type of preaching
[1:04:14] they said go the Lord has given you this
[1:04:18] land he's delivered into hand
[1:04:20] Jehoshaphat just sit there just watching
[1:04:26] all right all right praise the
[1:04:29] Lord you got to be listening to what God
[1:04:31] is saying to you you got to make sure
[1:04:33] it's according to the word of God don't
[1:04:35] get caught up in a moment you got to say
[1:04:36] is this part of the Bible is this what
[1:04:38] the message
[1:04:42] says and listen to this Jehosaphat was
[1:04:46] uh Ahab was so happy and the preachers
[1:04:49] were so happy because they made Ahab
[1:04:51] happy yes let me tell you a true
[1:04:53] Minister that stands behind the GOP the
[1:04:55] the the pulit here is not interested in
[1:04:57] making you happy they're interested in
[1:04:59] making your soul
[1:05:01] saved yes sir it might tear you to
[1:05:04] pieces it might break you up but God
[1:05:08] brings the healing to get you back on
[1:05:10] that path yes he does brother
[1:05:13] amen go up
[1:05:17] prosper and
[1:05:19] so Jehoshaphat says after all the
[1:05:22] preaching was done Jehoshaphat says um
[1:05:24] he let me ask you a question
[1:05:26] um I now I appreciate those 400 prophets
[1:05:29] and I listen really intensively to what
[1:05:31] they said I couldn't really find it in
[1:05:33] the
[1:05:35] scripture I was looking through I was
[1:05:37] looking at Genesis didn't see it there I
[1:05:39] was looking at the prophets I didn't see
[1:05:41] it there I even looked at Revelation and
[1:05:43] there was nothing there I looked at the
[1:05:45] message couldn't find a thing where
[1:05:46] those prophets saying I mean they
[1:05:47] shouted really good they they danced
[1:05:50] pretty well their voice was fantastic
[1:05:52] and they were so eloquently spoken
[1:05:56] come on you got to see through all that
[1:05:58] facade and say I need some gospel truth
[1:06:02] am may not agree with my belief but as
[1:06:04] long as it's tied to the word of God I'm
[1:06:06] going to hold to it
[1:06:09] am and jehos says is there not
[1:06:13] one
[1:06:16] now and the king of Israel said unto him
[1:06:20] there is
[1:06:22] one a shading
[1:06:26] that that's that's very
[1:06:27] shady think about it because Jehosaphat
[1:06:31] probably looked at Ahab and says you
[1:06:32] brought 400 but you left one of them
[1:06:34] [Music]
[1:06:36] out you brought 400 of your best but you
[1:06:38] left one out right oh my and the one
[1:06:41] that I want to see that's the one that
[1:06:42] you didn't want to
[1:06:45] bring amen bring him I want to hear from
[1:06:49] him right I want to hear some gospel
[1:06:51] truth from him I want to be delivered I
[1:06:55] want to I want the chains broken I want
[1:06:57] to know the raw truth I may not like it
[1:07:00] the flesh may not like it the caral Mind
[1:07:02] may not like it but as long as my spirit
[1:07:05] can say Amen to it I want to receive
[1:07:08] nothing but the
[1:07:14] truth and the king of Israel said unto
[1:07:17] Jehosaphat there is yet one man Micah
[1:07:22] the son of imla
[1:07:26] by whom we have we may inquire of the
[1:07:30] Lord but
[1:07:31] I hate
[1:07:36] him I hate
[1:07:40] him not not like I I dislike him not
[1:07:44] that he gets me gets on my nerves I hate
[1:07:47] him and if I I could only imagine if I
[1:07:49] was there in the presence of those two
[1:07:51] King talking I would have heard the gut
[1:07:53] of Ahab rumbled
[1:07:57] hate you laugh but that's how the devil
[1:07:59] feels about you the devil hates
[1:08:03] you every time you get up in the morning
[1:08:06] the devil hates that every time you come
[1:08:08] to church and you say praise God the
[1:08:10] devil hates that every time you praise
[1:08:13] God and give him your best the devil
[1:08:14] hates that whatever whatever the devil
[1:08:17] hates that's what I do more
[1:08:20] [Applause]
[1:08:21] of if the devil don't like praise I
[1:08:24] praise them more
[1:08:26] if the devil if the devil doesn't like
[1:08:28] me being in church I'm at church
[1:08:31] [Applause]
[1:08:32] hourly praise the Lord hallelujah if the
[1:08:36] devil doesn't like me singing I sing the
[1:08:39] loudest whatever the devil doesn't like
[1:08:42] I do more of it cuz I'm here to torment
[1:08:45] the
[1:08:47] devil hallah you're not a
[1:08:50] pushover God has endowed you with
[1:08:53] spiritual Powers Hallelujah speak the
[1:08:55] word of God hallelujah don't let the
[1:08:59] devil rule over your house you're the
[1:09:01] head of your
[1:09:04] houseen amen that devil hates you every
[1:09:07] time he sees you he just
[1:09:09] sees when you're smiling that makes him
[1:09:12] the worst it's like every time she knows
[1:09:14] she's sick but she's smiling through
[1:09:18] it there's a God that she believes
[1:09:22] in she knows what the doctor just said
[1:09:24] about her house but yet she's praising
[1:09:27] God praise God in the storm praise God
[1:09:31] when you don't feel well praise God when
[1:09:33] you're sick so that way when your
[1:09:35] healing come you have even more reason
[1:09:38] to praise
[1:09:42] God am oh
[1:09:46] yes ab ab say he does not prophesy he
[1:09:49] doesn't preach anything I like it's as
[1:09:52] if he's in my home it's as if he's in my
[1:09:55] CL it it's as if he's in my job like
[1:09:58] like he's just everywhere I go I just
[1:10:01] don't like his
[1:10:03] preaching just make me feel
[1:10:04] uncomfortable that's why you know that's
[1:10:06] why I just don't like coming to church
[1:10:07] but you know I I just I want people to
[1:10:09] think otherwise right like I got to be
[1:10:11] in the church cuz I want people to think
[1:10:15] differently you're not impressing you
[1:10:18] sister you didn't show up for your
[1:10:20] brother you proven a point of God Amen
[1:10:24] that's right
[1:10:27] my
[1:10:29] God I hate him he does not pro prophesy
[1:10:32] good concerning me but evil the Bible
[1:10:34] says woe to them that call evil good and
[1:10:37] good evil that's the day we're living in
[1:10:40] people don't know the difference they're
[1:10:42] calling evil good and good evil they
[1:10:44] don't know the difference they're so
[1:10:45] deceived amen and Jehoshaphat being the
[1:10:48] the the the wiser of the two says let
[1:10:50] not the king say so let's just here
[1:10:53] amiah you never know let's just
[1:10:56] terma and
[1:10:58] so the king of
[1:11:00] Israel called an officer and said hasten
[1:11:04] hither
[1:11:06] Micaiah the son of
[1:11:08] imla I'm sure as uh the officer came to
[1:11:14] Ahab Ahab summons him come here officer
[1:11:17] runs yes sir go get
[1:11:21] Micaiah snorting because he's all upset
[1:11:24] Joseph probably picking up with those
[1:11:26] exus is like I don't like his attitude
[1:11:28] but now I'm really interested in by
[1:11:29] hearing what this preast is
[1:11:31] say I'm really interested in what he has
[1:11:33] to say I'm going to be comfortable for
[1:11:35] this service cuz he's going to preach
[1:11:36] some good work especially if he doesn't
[1:11:38] like it oh I know I'm going to love
[1:11:41] it and Ahab says go fetch Micaiah and he
[1:11:45] looks at the officer and he gives him a
[1:11:47] win you know what to do so he
[1:11:51] goes and the king of Israel and
[1:11:55] Jehoshaphat the king of Judah sat each
[1:11:58] on his
[1:12:00] throne having put on the robes in a void
[1:12:03] place in the entrance of the Gate of
[1:12:06] Samaria and all the prophets prophesies
[1:12:09] before them so they're just waiting for
[1:12:11] Micaiah to come and ahab's looking at
[1:12:13] those 400 prophets just smiling away
[1:12:16] thinking about ramoth Gilead and feeling
[1:12:18] blessed feeling special josephat just
[1:12:20] like you know something just don't feel
[1:12:22] right about
[1:12:23] this just something just ain't right you
[1:12:25] know sometimes you you know sometimes
[1:12:27] you'll find yourself in a situation
[1:12:29] where you may not find a scripture for
[1:12:30] something but you just know it's not
[1:12:32] right you may not find a quote but you
[1:12:34] just know it's not right trust what God
[1:12:36] is trying to tell
[1:12:37] you it may not you may not find in the
[1:12:39] scripture but your spirit is tied to
[1:12:41] God's words God is protecting you the
[1:12:44] Bible says shun every appearance of evil
[1:12:47] shun every appearance of evil it may not
[1:12:50] be evil but the fact that it looks like
[1:12:52] the devil I'm going to stay away from it
[1:12:56] I'm not going to tempt
[1:12:58] God can we say praise the Lord Lord
[1:13:03] amen and zedekiah the son of chia made
[1:13:07] him horns some beautiful horns and he
[1:13:11] said thus sayi the
[1:13:14] Lord now I caught this for the first
[1:13:17] time he says thus say the
[1:13:20] Lord he didn't get a word from the Lord
[1:13:23] blasphemy
[1:13:25] Dangerous Grounds using Lord as an
[1:13:29] opportunity to confirm his
[1:13:31] position oh my God
[1:13:34] Amen with these
[1:13:37] horns Thou shalt push the syrians until
[1:13:41] thou H ha consumed
[1:13:43] [Music]
[1:13:44] them and all the prophets prophesy so
[1:13:48] saying go up to rain with Gilead and
[1:13:50] prosper and for the Lord shall delivered
[1:13:52] into the king's end you will prosper
[1:14:00] and the messenger that was gone to call
[1:14:03] Micaiah spake unto him saying listen now
[1:14:08] Micaiah the king want to see
[1:14:11] you
[1:14:12] now we know that uh how you
[1:14:18] preach we're not always in full
[1:14:21] agreement with the way you you preach
[1:14:23] the word but this is an important
[1:14:26] occasion the king is wanting to go
[1:14:29] because the King has made up his mind
[1:14:32] sometimes people pray about something
[1:14:33] but they've already made up their
[1:14:35] mind God look at you just kind of
[1:14:39] Chuckles you made up your mind and you
[1:14:41] come go God should I do this and in your
[1:14:43] heart you've already decided to do
[1:14:45] it so no matter what God says you've
[1:14:47] already decided it when you confront God
[1:14:50] when you approach God about something
[1:14:52] you got to have a clear heart say Lord
[1:14:54] whatever you decide that's what I'm
[1:14:56] going to do amen you want to hold God
[1:14:59] accountable for what he puts in your
[1:15:01] heart when you if you decide to if he
[1:15:02] tells you to do something or not do
[1:15:04] something because you're following the
[1:15:06] leadership of the holy spirit amen amen
[1:15:09] and so no matter what a preacher
[1:15:11] preaches a minister preaches if you've
[1:15:12] already made your decision you haven't
[1:15:13] consulted God there's no good that this
[1:15:15] word's going to do for you you got to be
[1:15:17] willing to yield yourself to the Holy
[1:15:18] Spirit say Lord whatsoever the
[1:15:20] whatsoever you desire that's what I'm
[1:15:22] going to do
[1:15:25] and so they go to Micaiah and say look I
[1:15:27] want you to listen
[1:15:29] now they've already preached this gospel
[1:15:32] they've said it's okay they they're
[1:15:34] giving Micaiah The Cliff Notes they're
[1:15:37] giving Micaiah these uh these notes to
[1:15:40] compare but Micaiah is not anyone's
[1:15:42] puppet right
[1:15:45] right Micaiah didn't fall for their
[1:15:48] trap and here's the thing
[1:15:51] Micaiah he wanted to seek God
[1:15:55] Revelation behind what he should
[1:15:58] preach I can't even begin to tell you
[1:16:01] and I and I'll just maybe open up a
[1:16:03] little bit because I've been find myself
[1:16:04] guilty and I've been a little bit more
[1:16:05] cautious and over the years you gain a
[1:16:07] little bit more wisdom and maturity
[1:16:08] around these things but you get caught
[1:16:10] up in the moment and you quote some you
[1:16:12] quote some something a preacher says and
[1:16:14] and it say brother Braham said and you
[1:16:16] you get caught up in a moment and I say
[1:16:18] brother Bram said and one time a brother
[1:16:19] caught me and just you know just a good
[1:16:21] Fellowship like can you show me the
[1:16:22] quote where brother Bram said this that
[1:16:23] and the other like yeah I'm all jealous
[1:16:25] and all happy I'm like I I can't wait to
[1:16:26] show you I'm like I'm going to get right
[1:16:28] back with you this was before like the
[1:16:29] age of where we had the real good
[1:16:30] instant communication so I went back and
[1:16:32] I
[1:16:34] looked went back and I
[1:16:38] looked went back and I
[1:16:40] looked looked
[1:16:42] again called another brother I'm like
[1:16:44] hey bro let me ask you a question uh you
[1:16:46] know the quote where the brother brother
[1:16:47] says X Y andz they're like yeah he all
[1:16:49] excited with me I'm like that's a good
[1:16:50] quote a it's like yeah show me where
[1:16:52] it's at he's like yeah let me call you
[1:16:53] back
[1:16:55] waited
[1:16:57] uhhuh waited
[1:16:59] uhhuh waited uhhuh the brother called me
[1:17:02] back he like Hey Brother Jean um I I
[1:17:04] couldn't find the quote I couldn't find
[1:17:06] a quote so we start rationalizing maybe
[1:17:08] he meant to say this and that and so
[1:17:11] finally I realized the quote was never
[1:17:15] there and what happened was that there
[1:17:18] was variations of that quote it's like
[1:17:21] when you whisper something to somebody
[1:17:22] on one side by the time it gets to the
[1:17:24] in person it's a completely different
[1:17:27] message that's the reason why you just
[1:17:29] don't quote something that because
[1:17:30] somebody else says it you got to look
[1:17:32] for it in the scripture you got to the
[1:17:34] Bible says prove all things and hold
[1:17:37] fast to that which is good sir yes sir
[1:17:42] and I learned that the hardware I said
[1:17:43] Lord thank you for giving me that lesson
[1:17:45] next time I know I'm not going to be
[1:17:47] just somebody else that's just going to
[1:17:48] quote something I want to be able to say
[1:17:50] there it is in the
[1:17:52] word be your own person
[1:17:57] don't quote just because you hear the
[1:17:58] quote you got to go back and look for it
[1:18:00] and say I see it in the message I see it
[1:18:02] in the word yes sir amen and Micaiah
[1:18:06] understood that he's like I'm not going
[1:18:07] to just say what he says just because he
[1:18:09] said this thus say the Lord we just saw
[1:18:11] where zedekiah says thus sayith the Lord
[1:18:13] and it wasn't really thus sayith the
[1:18:14] Lord it was thus say
[1:18:17] [Music]
[1:18:18] zedekiah you got to know where you
[1:18:21] stand because the devil throw all kinds
[1:18:23] of stuff at you
[1:18:26] and Mah was not concerned about making
[1:18:28] Ahab happy right because the good thing
[1:18:31] Mah knows he says you know what I'm not
[1:18:33] on ahab's
[1:18:34] payroll
[1:18:36] right amen I'm not on ahab's payroll he
[1:18:40] does not write my check he does not
[1:18:42] write my money he does not give me a
[1:18:44] paycheck I can preach whatever I want to
[1:18:47] preach the Bible says that the borrower
[1:18:50] is servant to the lender
[1:18:54] amen yes
[1:18:57] sir the borrower is servant to the
[1:18:59] lender for any of us who's paying
[1:19:01] mortgage that's what the very root of
[1:19:03] that word is death yeah
[1:19:08] Mor that's the very root of that word
[1:19:11] you go to a morchary that's what
[1:19:12] mortgage is that when you get a loan
[1:19:15] you're tied to that all the way till
[1:19:17] you're that's right amen the borrower is
[1:19:21] servant to the lender and the devil
[1:19:23] understands that concept he tries to put
[1:19:25] you in a position where you're
[1:19:26] constantly a servant to him that's the
[1:19:28] reason why I could look to the blood of
[1:19:30] Jesus Christ that has paid all my
[1:19:33] debts so you're no longer bounded by the
[1:19:36] devil that's the reason why the Bible
[1:19:38] says he who the son has set free is free
[1:19:42] indeed you're no longer servant to the
[1:19:45] devil the chains have been broken and
[1:19:48] God has prid all your debts
[1:19:52] Jesus amen the devil realize that but
[1:19:55] some of us don't don't realize that and
[1:19:57] we still pay interest to the
[1:19:59] devil we still pay interest to the devil
[1:20:01] and God telling you stop paying interest
[1:20:03] I paid all of that there's nothing for
[1:20:05] you to do all I need you to do is
[1:20:07] worship
[1:20:09] me when you get in the bill in the mail
[1:20:12] and it's from the devil just rip it up
[1:20:13] say God's already paid for
[1:20:15] that check your records check the
[1:20:18] database something's wrong cuz God paid
[1:20:21] my debt he paid the debt I did oh I owe
[1:20:26] a debt I could not pay that's the that's
[1:20:29] what I believe
[1:20:33] in he paid the debt for
[1:20:35] you Lord don't walk around believing
[1:20:38] that you're servant of the devil that
[1:20:41] you're bounded by him that you're
[1:20:43] committed to him that you're imprisoned
[1:20:45] by
[1:20:46] him amen I might have shared this before
[1:20:49] but there's a story of
[1:20:50] a they often use this in business of a
[1:20:55] of a baby elephant that was tied to the
[1:20:58] tree and they chain this baby elephant
[1:21:01] to the tree and every time the baby
[1:21:04] elephant kind of tries to go can't
[1:21:07] really go
[1:21:10] anywhere so he felt like he didn't have
[1:21:13] any strength he tried it again felt like
[1:21:16] he didn't have any strength over the
[1:21:19] years he was getting
[1:21:21] bigger but over the years because he was
[1:21:24] tied to that tree he was getting less
[1:21:27] discouraged making forth an effort
[1:21:29] because in Prior years experience he had
[1:21:31] been
[1:21:33] unsuccessful and when now he had matured
[1:21:35] into his full potential he had stopped
[1:21:38] trying completely because he's relied on
[1:21:40] his past experience that he has not been
[1:21:42] successful so even though he had the
[1:21:44] ability to just break the tree and set
[1:21:47] himself free his mind binded him binded
[1:21:51] him all the way to the Past I'm telling
[1:21:52] you the devil's holding you to your pth
[1:21:55] when God has forgiven you of your past
[1:21:58] break the tree and be free of the things
[1:22:01] of the
[1:22:02] [Applause]
[1:22:05] past God that's why I like the story of
[1:22:10] Rahab she had a
[1:22:12] history boy she had a history God came
[1:22:16] on the scene killed
[1:22:19] everybody everybody as a brother said
[1:22:22] God erased her history
[1:22:27] Somebody went through it says I heard
[1:22:30] you said I heard you did this I heard
[1:22:32] you did that all have says show me one
[1:22:35] show me one her past was
[1:22:38] gone her history was no longer around
[1:22:42] God has taken your history and put it
[1:22:45] underneath the blood you have no past
[1:22:48] sins God has blessed you thank you Lord
[1:22:52] hallelujah praise the Lord
[1:22:55] thank you
[1:22:57] Lord
[1:22:59] God praise God let Thy word I pray thee
[1:23:03] be like one of
[1:23:05] them and Micaiah said as the Lord liveth
[1:23:09] yes I want you to follow this as the
[1:23:12] Lord liveth yes Jesus what the Lord
[1:23:15] saith unto me that will I speak as the
[1:23:19] Lord liveth as long as God is alive yes
[1:23:23] yes
[1:23:24] I'm going to serve him as long as he's
[1:23:27] alive I'm going to say what he says as
[1:23:30] long as he's alive I'm going to preach
[1:23:32] this word as long as he's alive I'm
[1:23:34] going to Echo what the word says but if
[1:23:37] there isn't a true God then my purpose
[1:23:40] doesn't make sense but as long as he's
[1:23:43] alive yeah he started with that yeah he
[1:23:47] wanted to preface and let the officer
[1:23:49] know when you get back to Ahab I want
[1:23:50] you to let him know if God's Alive I'm
[1:23:53] going to say what he says right so that
[1:23:56] way when you get back to him before he
[1:23:57] sees me he's not too
[1:24:00] upset right amen can you just imagine
[1:24:03] you walk differently when you know God's
[1:24:05] with
[1:24:06] you there's a degree of confidence when
[1:24:08] you know God's with you you can approach
[1:24:10] a situation knowing that God's with you
[1:24:13] and not only God all the host of Heaven
[1:24:14] stands with you
[1:24:17] amen when
[1:24:19] Abraham was outside of the will of God
[1:24:23] when abrah was in the will of God he was
[1:24:26] able to defeat five
[1:24:30] Kings five Kings easy right he was in
[1:24:34] the will of God he was able to defeat
[1:24:36] five Kings when he was outside of the
[1:24:38] will of God he was afraid of one
[1:24:43] king the difference between that when
[1:24:46] you when you're in the will of God you
[1:24:48] know that there's not a devil that could
[1:24:50] comee before you thank you Lord but when
[1:24:53] you outside of the will God you're the
[1:24:55] most timid and cry Lord cuz the devil's
[1:24:58] put that over you right right and Jesus
[1:25:00] himself he came on the scene the first
[1:25:02] thing he says fear not little flock
[1:25:04] because it's not in your nature that's
[1:25:06] not meant for you it was never meant for
[1:25:07] you to have fear the reason why the
[1:25:10] Bible says in Genesis when Adam fell and
[1:25:12] when God went looking for him Adam Where
[1:25:14] Art Thou and finally Adam comes out the
[1:25:16] Woodworks and he says he says I heard
[1:25:18] your voice and he says a word that God
[1:25:20] never taught him I was
[1:25:23] afraid and God was like afraid we you
[1:25:25] never been afraid before we've had
[1:25:27] Fellowship all the time you you and I we
[1:25:29] talked all the time we like why would
[1:25:31] you be afraid now because he was outside
[1:25:33] of the will of God the moment you're
[1:25:35] outside of the will of God that's when
[1:25:37] fear begins to set in so if you're
[1:25:39] anxious about something if you're
[1:25:40] fearful about something say Lord help me
[1:25:42] get my life right what is not in order
[1:25:44] cuz I should not have the spirit of fear
[1:25:46] you've given me the spirit of overcoming
[1:25:49] power amen
[1:25:55] right so my guy walked
[1:25:58] up the Bible says he came to the king
[1:26:01] can you just imagine aab inting there
[1:26:03] just looking at him just grinding his
[1:26:04] teeth just seeing him come walking in
[1:26:07] just seething and upset and just his
[1:26:09] heart rate's going up if you were to
[1:26:10] take his blood pressure it just would
[1:26:12] have rose up like he was just every my
[1:26:14] didn't even say a word he's already
[1:26:15] upset he's huffing and puffing like I
[1:26:17] just know he's going to the moment he
[1:26:18] opens his mouth he's going to say
[1:26:22] something and meanwhile just watching
[1:26:25] this he's like okay well okay he seems
[1:26:27] like a servant of God to me all right he
[1:26:29] a show Bold and he he's not all out
[1:26:32] there he's just kind of humble I like
[1:26:33] the way he's presenting himself he's all
[1:26:35] excited he's like I'm getting ready to
[1:26:36] hear the
[1:26:38] word and so he came to the king and the
[1:26:41] King said unto
[1:26:43] Micaiah
[1:26:44] Mah you heard what the prophet said all
[1:26:48] 400 of them eloquent men that went to
[1:26:50] the best schools in the nation they know
[1:26:52] what they're talking about they know
[1:26:53] exact they didn't even stutter micaa
[1:26:56] unlike you I don't know where you came
[1:26:57] from I don't know where you got your
[1:26:58] education I don't know who your God is
[1:27:00] but what j i here want to hear from
[1:27:04] you and I want to ask you Mah now we've
[1:27:07] already decided this because we were we
[1:27:09] heard from the prophet shall we go to
[1:27:11] RIS Gilead to battle or shall we
[1:27:15] forbear you know it's just kind of like
[1:27:17] that and should we go should we not go
[1:27:20] you trying to tell me better not tell me
[1:27:22] I shouldn't go
[1:27:25] and Mak is like you know what let's go
[1:27:28] go go
[1:27:30] Prosper the Lord shall delivered into
[1:27:32] your
[1:27:33] hand woo that got the king really
[1:27:37] upset and the King said unto him how
[1:27:40] many
[1:27:42] times shall I adure
[1:27:45] you that you tell me nothing but the
[1:27:49] truth quit mocking
[1:27:51] me quit making fun of me m the head of a
[1:27:55] Nation you got people all around
[1:27:57] watching how you treat me I don't like
[1:27:59] this tell me the truth I'm a man I could
[1:28:01] take it all righta gted up his loins
[1:28:05] okay cracked his neck stretched his back
[1:28:08] he's like y this is what the Lord told
[1:28:09] me I'm getting ready for this and then
[1:28:12] he begins to preach the gospel Oh my he
[1:28:15] didn't even hold back he immediately
[1:28:17] started with the punch line I saw all
[1:28:19] Israel scattered yeah yeah he didn't
[1:28:22] even tell him not to go none of that he
[1:28:23] just that's all Israel scattered you
[1:28:25] read between the line you want to go you
[1:28:26] could go but that's all Israel
[1:28:30] scattered M didn't even hold back when
[1:28:34] God is preaching the word of
[1:28:37] God sometimes you might think it's
[1:28:40] personal to you which it could
[1:28:41] be especially from a pastor perspective
[1:28:44] I'll give you this perspective
[1:28:45] especially from a pastor perspective he
[1:28:47] may it up there he start he may have
[1:28:49] counsel counsel with the pastor and then
[1:28:51] he gets up there the next Sunday or a
[1:28:54] couple of Sundays and he start preaching
[1:28:56] on things and next thing you know he
[1:28:58] start going down a path that you know he
[1:29:00] start hitting on things and then you
[1:29:03] start back there listening and you start
[1:29:05] squirming in your chairs like I know I
[1:29:07] just talked to the pastor about that
[1:29:08] he's probably talking about me I know
[1:29:10] that's where that storm is coming from
[1:29:12] and you you can say Amen you can say
[1:29:14] hallelujah you can say praise the Lord
[1:29:15] cuz you all huffing and puffing because
[1:29:17] you like I had a counsel with that
[1:29:19] Pastor and I know this is all about me
[1:29:20] and you trying to I try to see if you
[1:29:22] could get gauge eye contact with the
[1:29:23] pastor cuz you want him to see
[1:29:27] you on you just want him to see you like
[1:29:30] cuz you don't like it but what you don't
[1:29:32] know it's not even the pastor himself
[1:29:35] because he's standing behind the P since
[1:29:36] I'm telling you this from experience
[1:29:37] he's standing behind the pulpit he's
[1:29:39] transfixed he's brought into a dimension
[1:29:42] he's entered into a
[1:29:44] channel when now he's preaching under a
[1:29:47] certain
[1:29:48] anointing and he sees the spirits that
[1:29:51] are roaming within the church and it's
[1:29:54] no longer about you but the spirit
[1:29:56] that's dealing with you is now looking
[1:29:58] to look for someone else he's not
[1:30:01] preaching about you he's preaching at
[1:30:04] that spirit because there's somebody
[1:30:06] else that could be vulnerable to that
[1:30:07] same
[1:30:11] spirit so he's preaching to the spirit
[1:30:14] to depart from this place so that way
[1:30:16] that person that become a victim like
[1:30:18] you are
[1:30:20] victim amen that's it brother praise the
[1:30:24] Lord
[1:30:26] hallelujah so whenever you're hearing
[1:30:28] the word of God preach and it starts
[1:30:30] going right into your household right
[1:30:32] into your bedroom right into your closet
[1:30:34] right into the rooms whatever is going
[1:30:36] you say Lord so be it according to Thy
[1:30:40] word am my God
[1:30:44] Amen and as if that wasn't enough
[1:30:47] sometimes God will bring a preacher from
[1:30:48] another location could be me somebody
[1:30:50] else and start preaching about the very
[1:30:52] same thing and you're looking that
[1:30:54] church you can't wait till after church
[1:30:55] to tell somebody I know he talked to
[1:30:56] that brother about me that Pastor didn't
[1:30:58] say nothing about your business it's God
[1:31:00] that's dealing with you accept that and
[1:31:02] say Amen to it quit criticizing the
[1:31:05] ministry and start accepting when God is
[1:31:07] dealing with
[1:31:09] you amen now let me tell you something I
[1:31:12] didn't't talked to brother Jack so I
[1:31:13] don't know what's been preached this is
[1:31:14] all just brother Jee under the anointing
[1:31:16] of the holy spirit so I want you to
[1:31:17] sitting there with the devil in your
[1:31:19] mind I wonder if he talk to brother Jack
[1:31:21] I didn't talk to brother Jack I talked
[1:31:23] to the Lord Jesus himself everything I'm
[1:31:25] telling you is under the anointing of
[1:31:30] God hallelujah amen sometimes you get
[1:31:33] amen sometimes you get the oh my that's
[1:31:35] all right it's still part of the
[1:31:37] gospel God Amen when you feel good like
[1:31:40] amen when you know it's hitting on oh my
[1:31:42] Lord Jesus bless me Lord help me it's
[1:31:44] still the truth
[1:31:46] nonetheless
[1:31:48] amen and he says I saw all Israel
[1:31:50] scattered he says I saw all Israel
[1:31:53] scattered
[1:31:54] upon the hills as a sheep that have not
[1:31:56] a shepherd and the Lord said these have
[1:31:59] no master can you just imagine the
[1:32:03] people watching this and just listen say
[1:32:04] that yep that's exactly what he preached
[1:32:06] last time that's exactly what he
[1:32:07] preached last time the prophets are all
[1:32:09] upset because they contradicted their
[1:32:10] preaching and meanwhile Joseph as like
[1:32:12] this is praise the Lord I knew there was
[1:32:13] something to this and meanwhile Ahab man
[1:32:16] his heart's racing like 100 miles and
[1:32:17] hour and he's looking at Micaiah he's
[1:32:19] trying to give him that eye just you
[1:32:21] better stop saying you just stop right
[1:32:23] there but micai was full force because
[1:32:25] he was anointed of the Holy Spirit and
[1:32:27] there was nothing that could hold him
[1:32:28] back hallelujah amen praise the Lord
[1:32:33] now and the king of Israel said unto
[1:32:35] Jehoshaphat listen to this now the king
[1:32:37] of Israel said unto Jehoshaphat now keep
[1:32:40] in mind these are two members in the
[1:32:42] assembly one shouting and rejoicing
[1:32:45] saying that is nothing but the truth and
[1:32:46] the other one seething and upset because
[1:32:48] the word is being truth and you know
[1:32:49] what Ahab tried to do triy to steal
[1:32:51] jehoshaphat's Joy
[1:32:54] yep the devil looks at you seeing you
[1:32:56] shouting praising God in Hallelujah said
[1:32:57] what you shouting
[1:32:59] about it's like one brother told me he
[1:33:01] like a husband and wife was SK into an
[1:33:03] argument coming go coming to church I
[1:33:05] heard that that coming to church and
[1:33:07] they were arguing arguing and they was
[1:33:09] fussing and so finally the the they get
[1:33:11] to church and the husband's all praising
[1:33:13] the Lord and he's shouting and he's
[1:33:15] screaming and he's and the wife's in
[1:33:16] there looking at him just like all upset
[1:33:18] knowing that good and well they had to
[1:33:20] got into an argument right before they
[1:33:21] came to church after church the the wife
[1:33:23] goes up to the husband and says aren't
[1:33:25] you ashamed and embarrassed of yourself
[1:33:26] that you were shouting and praising God
[1:33:28] and hollering and screaming you know we
[1:33:30] got into an argument and the brother
[1:33:31] looks at his wife and says let me tell
[1:33:33] you dear I was upset with you but I
[1:33:34] wasn't upset with
[1:33:36] God have your priority straight when you
[1:33:39] come to the house of the Lord it's all
[1:33:41] about you and your maker it's about you
[1:33:46] and your creator it's about you and God
[1:33:50] yes amen Joseph had Ahab looks at
[1:33:54] Jehoshaphat says I told you he doesn't
[1:33:56] preach any good Jehoshaphat probably
[1:33:57] looked at Ahab like I don't know
[1:33:58] everything he said I can see right in
[1:34:00] the in Genesis I saw it there I saw in
[1:34:02] the book of kings and Isaiah spoke about
[1:34:03] it and so did the revelations speak
[1:34:05] about it he's like I see it in the
[1:34:07] scripture I like what he had to
[1:34:15] say verse 19 he said hear thou therefore
[1:34:18] the word of the Lord now this is one of
[1:34:21] them rare Glimpse that that we often
[1:34:24] don't read about in the scripture but it
[1:34:28] brings you into a realm where you can
[1:34:30] see what is happening behind the scenes
[1:34:35] are you with me yes sir so we will
[1:34:37] introduce prophets coming
[1:34:39] out preaching false Doctrine lying in
[1:34:45] favor of Ahab right how could it
[1:34:49] be so micaa says let me explain to you
[1:34:54] you why this is happening and listen he
[1:34:57] says Hear thou therefore the word of the
[1:34:59] Lord I Saw the Lord sitting on his
[1:35:04] throne and all the hosts of Heaven
[1:35:08] standing by him on his right hand and on
[1:35:12] his left he's bringing you into his
[1:35:14] vision so if you could imagine this the
[1:35:16] Lord is Seated on his throne
[1:35:21] exalted watching all these things and
[1:35:24] the host of Heaven All Surrounded
[1:35:29] him and the Lord
[1:35:31] said who shall persuade
[1:35:36] Ahab that's what the Bible says yeah
[1:35:39] there was a conference now can you just
[1:35:41] imagine that Saints I want you to pay
[1:35:42] attention like this is in there for our
[1:35:44] examples yes
[1:35:46] sir they were having a
[1:35:48] conversation about
[1:35:51] Ahab all the host of the
[1:35:54] Lord good spirits bad spirits that all
[1:35:58] came and God's like well how can we
[1:36:01] persuade Ahab they're talking about
[1:36:04] Ahab God talks about you you in God's
[1:36:10] conversation you're in God's
[1:36:13] conversation that's how important you
[1:36:16] are even though Ahab hadn't done what
[1:36:19] he' done yet they're trying to persuade
[1:36:22] him because he's already made a carnal
[1:36:24] decision that that's what he's want he's
[1:36:26] going to
[1:36:27] do so and the Bible goes on to say this
[1:36:30] listen and one said on this manner and
[1:36:34] another said on that manner they're
[1:36:36] offering God suggestions and ideas on
[1:36:39] what can need we do can you just imagine
[1:36:42] that the whole horse of heaven and they
[1:36:43] have had no idea he just mind on his
[1:36:45] business and he's like yeah I'm going to
[1:36:46] go get r with gillad I'm going to do
[1:36:47] this I'm going to do that I'm going to
[1:36:48] do that and so a conference God calls a
[1:36:50] conference and so you see they're saying
[1:36:52] well you could persuade him this way you
[1:36:53] could do this way and and and I you
[1:36:56] could imagine every Spirit saying well I
[1:36:58] know ahab's weakness I know he could if
[1:37:00] you get him to do this he'll do it I
[1:37:02] know if you get the devil knows your
[1:37:05] weakness they they're talking they're
[1:37:07] like you know no no try this n that

[1:37:17] a we this I don't know you think he's
[1:37:18] going to fall for that we could try

[1:38:06] while you come to
[1:38:07] church the devil let me tell you Saints
[1:38:09] this is not accidental the devil is
[1:38:11] constantly battling with you he's trying
[1:38:14] to take you out the game but God has
[1:38:16] called you to overcome the Ws of the
[1:38:19] devil let me tell you the way the reason
[1:38:22] why you know that in the will of God
[1:38:24] you're constantly in the
[1:38:28] battle you're constantly in the battle
[1:38:31] you're constantly in a trial you're
[1:38:33] constantly going through something you
[1:38:35] know you're in the will of
[1:38:36] God praise the Lord when you're in the
[1:38:40] battle because you know you're doing
[1:38:43] something that's
[1:38:46] [Applause]
[1:38:48] right
[1:38:51] amen amen
[1:38:54] and somebody in the host shouted out
[1:38:57] from the back say I got an
[1:39:00] idea and they all parted
[1:39:03] ways and the Bible says and there came
[1:39:05] forth a spirit and stood before the
[1:39:08] Lord and everybody just watching this
[1:39:10] this is all unfolding in heaven yeah and
[1:39:13] he says I will persuade
[1:39:15] him God's watching this he's like all
[1:39:17] right well how you going to do this
[1:39:20] now because I mentioned those 400 prop
[1:39:23] may have at sometime at some point
[1:39:25] preached the
[1:39:27] truth a lot of the Gospel that's
[1:39:29] preached sometimes there's 99%
[1:39:32] truth but it's the
[1:39:35] 1% that brings
[1:39:38] destruction amen I don't mean to discuss
[1:39:41] you but bear with me don't mean to
[1:39:43] discuss you but bear with me if I had a
[1:39:46] box of cookies some of your favorites
[1:39:49] you put it in your mind whatever your
[1:39:50] favorite hazel nuts chocolate chip you
[1:39:51] name it you can't res
[1:39:53] this I'm like well my dog just kind of
[1:39:56] had a mess and I didn't have really a
[1:39:58] towel and cleaned it up and not a whole
[1:40:02] lot that got into the batter now y'all
[1:40:04] looking a certain
[1:40:06] way would you still take that
[1:40:08] [Music]
[1:40:09] cookie it's it's just a small
[1:40:12] amount would you still take that
[1:40:15] cookie cuz you're thinking about
[1:40:16] something else he didn't wash his hands
[1:40:19] talking about 1% man that 1% is as equal
[1:40:21] as 99% yeah right yeah that's how the
[1:40:25] devil
[1:40:26] works we will notd and say oh that is
[1:40:29] disgusting but the devil shoves that
[1:40:30] stuff through our thought every
[1:40:33] day if we looked at this the same way
[1:40:35] spiritually we would say devil that's
[1:40:37] enough I'm not going to take that from
[1:40:39] you I'm not going to put that in my
[1:40:41] mouth I'm not going to say Amen to that
[1:40:44] I'm not going to not agree with that the
[1:40:46] Bible says man shall live by shall not
[1:40:48] live by bread alone but by every word
[1:40:50] that proceed from the mouth of God
[1:40:53] amen
[1:40:55] amen I don't know I just thought about
[1:40:57] it one time and I thought about it like
[1:40:58] if somebody offer me like as you know
[1:41:00] you know cuz we all have weak moments
[1:41:02] whether whatever sweets it is and
[1:41:03] somebody present you they say well it's
[1:41:04] just one ounce of X Y and Z and you're
[1:41:06] like oh man no no like you're you're
[1:41:09] your desire for that thing no longer
[1:41:12] exists your interest no longer exists it
[1:41:15] may look good but I know what's on the
[1:41:17] inside I know what it's made of if you
[1:41:20] could look at the Devil when he's
[1:41:22] presenting you attractive things you can
[1:41:24] say I know what that's made of it's of
[1:41:26] the devil and I don't want nothing to do
[1:41:28] with it people might look at you crazy
[1:41:31] let me tell you you have a revelation if
[1:41:33] I told you it and I didn't tell somebody
[1:41:34] else can you just imagine somebody come
[1:41:36] out you got some cookies that looks
[1:41:37] really
[1:41:38] good that would be your reaction you
[1:41:40] like oh Lord Jesus cuz you have a
[1:41:42] revelation that's the reason why
[1:41:44] Revelation is important because people
[1:41:47] are eating things of the devil and
[1:41:48] minding your own business and you're
[1:41:50] looking and you're saying that is nasty
[1:41:54] why because you have a
[1:41:58] revelation praise the Lord for a prophet
[1:42:01] that's the reason why you could act the
[1:42:02] way you
[1:42:05] can and they have the audacity to look
[1:42:07] at you and I like we're the ones crazy I
[1:42:11] know what went into the batter to make
[1:42:12] that cookie that you just ate that
[1:42:15] you're rejoicing over they say I got a
[1:42:17] weak tooth for this candy it don't
[1:42:19] matter you know what went into it that's
[1:42:22] the reason why prophecies above
[1:42:23] everything cry for
[1:42:25] Revelation because if you didn't know
[1:42:27] you would have been just as guilty as
[1:42:28] the other person that just grabbed a
[1:42:30] whole box of cookie giving it to their
[1:42:33] kids yeah you can react that's
[1:42:35] appropriate that's how you should react
[1:42:36] because you need to think about the same
[1:42:38] way when the Devil comes to you and
[1:42:40] start feeding your children
[1:42:43] things not my children if you won't eat
[1:42:47] it my children won't eat
[1:42:49] it if you won't have it my children
[1:42:51] won't have it amen praise God Amen but
[1:42:54] when you look out there in the world and
[1:42:56] they're giving their children filth
[1:42:57] they're giving their children garbage
[1:42:59] they're looking at you and having pity
[1:43:00] on you it's really you having pity on
[1:43:02] them because you have a revelation of
[1:43:04] what's in that
[1:43:08] stuff praise the Lord
[1:43:13] hallelujah and the Lord said unto that
[1:43:15] Spirit how you going to do this he says
[1:43:18] I will go forth and I will be a lying
[1:43:21] Spirit and the the mouth of All His
[1:43:26] prophets
[1:43:28] so in their
[1:43:30] defense they probably thought they were
[1:43:32] preaching the
[1:43:33] truth they were
[1:43:35] anointed but they were false anointed
[1:43:38] ones amen and they were preaching this
[1:43:41] Prosperity message to Ahab go get rth
[1:43:43] Galia this for you God's given it to
[1:43:45] you and
[1:43:48] Micaiah stood on the word of God yes sir
[1:43:53] and can you just imagine
[1:43:54] those can you just imagine those
[1:43:56] prophets M's like well there was a
[1:43:58] spirit that came and talked to God and
[1:44:00] say I'm going to be a lying spirit and
[1:44:03] amidst all those prophets and those 400
[1:44:05] prophets listen to them being preached
[1:44:09] about can you just imagine looking at
[1:44:11] one of I think he talking about us I
[1:44:12] know is he talking about he's talking
[1:44:14] about you he's talking about us all 400
[1:44:17] of them just listen to Micaiah preach
[1:44:20] and listen to this now therefore behold
[1:44:23] the Lord has put a lying spirit in the
[1:44:24] mouth of all these prophets and the Lord
[1:44:26] has spoken evil concerning thee and
[1:44:29] zedekiah he went from preaching the
[1:44:30] gospel of prosperity to punching him
[1:44:31] dead in his
[1:44:34] face yeah that's what the Bible said I
[1:44:37] read it zedekiah smoke M I don't think
[1:44:39] he smacked him a g I think it was a
[1:44:44] punch he went from preaching Prosperity
[1:44:47] God bless you oh he can't he can hurt a
[1:44:50] fly and he would and punched them dead
[1:44:52] in his face
[1:44:55] you could tell he didn't have a he
[1:44:57] didn't have an anchor that held
[1:44:59] him and Makai was preaching and
[1:45:01] preaching and he got
[1:45:04] punched jaw messed up probably all
[1:45:09] bloodied did micaa run no no M got to
[1:45:14] his feet got on his knees yeah he didn't
[1:45:18] stay down there cuz he was in done
[1:45:21] preaching and as weak as he was I don't
[1:45:23] think he got on by got up by himself God
[1:45:25] probably picked up his
[1:45:29] shoulders stumbled back a little bit he
[1:45:33] looked at
[1:45:33] zedekiah he told zedekiah you're going
[1:45:36] to be in the
[1:45:37] chamber hiding he was still preaching in
[1:45:40] his hurt in his pain in his bloody face
[1:45:45] he was still preaching the gospel he was
[1:45:48] not on payroll you may not like what I
[1:45:50] have to say you may not like how I dress
[1:45:53] you may not like how I talk but I have
[1:45:55] an obligation to preach to you the
[1:45:58] undeniable word of
[1:46:01] God it might pain me it might cause me
[1:46:05] Affliction but your soul is more
[1:46:09] important
[1:46:13] Hallelujah I am not here to compromise
[1:46:15] on the word of
[1:46:19] God your soul is more important
[1:46:24] [Applause]
[1:46:26] Lord and let me tell you Bea was not
[1:46:29] only preaching to Ahab but he was
[1:46:31] preaching to all of ahab's followers sir
[1:46:35] right that's the reason why he started
[1:46:37] off his sermon he says I saw Israel
[1:46:39] scattered like a sheep without a
[1:46:40] Shepherd Ahab this isn't about you it's
[1:46:43] about your nation it's about your people
[1:46:46] yes that's
[1:46:50] right he was bloody this gospel is a
[1:46:53] bloody
[1:46:56] mess don't think you goingon to be all
[1:46:58] looking good going in
[1:46:59] heaven like you haven't had any battle
[1:47:02] wounds like you haven't had any scars
[1:47:05] like you haven't been any fights let me
[1:47:06] tell you st hey we going to go in there
[1:47:10] we're going to we're going to talk about
[1:47:11] our battle School Battle Scars our
[1:47:13] battle
[1:47:15] wounds remember brother BR when was it
[1:47:18] the king you know he had all these he
[1:47:21] wanted to kind of really showcase a
[1:47:23] the the the men that were in battle that
[1:47:25] were where where their shields were all
[1:47:26] messed up and they were bloodied it
[1:47:29] proved that they were in a
[1:47:31] battle this is not a this is not
[1:47:35] intended to be an easy
[1:47:39] walk Paul says we cannot even compare
[1:47:43] the sufferings that we receive here with
[1:47:45] the glory that should be revealed over
[1:47:48] there if we could just endure for a
[1:47:51] moment Hallelujah
[1:47:53] every punch that you take is worth
[1:47:57] it every time you stumble Hallelujah but
[1:48:00] you get back up it's worth
[1:48:04] it like I say my Haitian
[1:48:07] tongue we take a hit we hit
[1:48:09] back cuz I don't know about y'all I mean
[1:48:11] I mean if we're in a fight you just not
[1:48:13] going to sit there and let the devil
[1:48:14] punch y'all in the face you got to fight
[1:48:15] back you got to take him to you got to
[1:48:17] take him to prayer and say Lord I know I
[1:48:19] had a challenge new day yesterday but
[1:48:21] I'm not going to give up I believe you
[1:48:22] called me for this I'm back on my knees
[1:48:25] amen because the devil's trying to he's
[1:48:28] trying to quench your thirst he's trying
[1:48:30] to stop you from talking to
[1:48:32] God but you got to be
[1:48:34] persistent yes
[1:48:37] Lord and M
[1:48:39] said behold Thou shalt see in that day
[1:48:43] he's talking to zedekiah when thou shalt
[1:48:45] go in the inner chamber to hide
[1:48:47] yourself bear with me Saints I'm almost
[1:48:49] done and the king of Israel said take
[1:48:52] Micaiah
[1:48:53] and carry him back to amam the governor
[1:48:56] of the city and to joash the King's son
[1:49:00] and say thus sayith the king put this
[1:49:03] fell in prison and feed him with bread
[1:49:06] of Affliction and with water of
[1:49:08] Affliction until I come and he had the
[1:49:11] audacity to say
[1:49:13] this until I come in peace
[1:49:19] oh people could man people could be so
[1:49:22] so stubborn in their
[1:49:24] ways tempting God defying the word of
[1:49:28] God until I come back in
[1:49:30] peace he just told you you're not going
[1:49:33] to come back much less come back in
[1:49:36] peace oh I see what you talking about
[1:49:38] come back in pieces I got it
[1:49:41] okay I don't know if that was a
[1:49:43] mispelling but maybe that's what he
[1:49:44] meant but he sure ain't going to come
[1:49:46] back because you're not going to make a
[1:49:48] lie out of
[1:49:50] God when God speaks to you can make a
[1:49:53] lie of God people might look at you and
[1:49:56] look at you differently and say things
[1:49:57] and do things as long as you know you
[1:49:59] have a strong conviction of God God will
[1:50:02] not make you a
[1:50:06] liar God's reputation is on the line
[1:50:09] your reputation is the line God will not
[1:50:11] make you a liar God will prove to the
[1:50:14] world that his word is true yes sir amen
[1:50:19] that's the reason why when you are in
[1:50:21] your sin when you were in your sickness
[1:50:24] when you were running with the wrong
[1:50:25] crowd had a foul mouth God looked at you
[1:50:28] and said I made the right decision about
[1:50:30] you and that was even before you started
[1:50:32] serving
[1:50:34] God and now that you're sitting here
[1:50:37] you're not going to prove God wrong
[1:50:39] praise God Amen am
[1:50:43] Hallelujah Andy didn't let that go no
[1:50:47] when aab says you know when I come back
[1:50:49] in peace I'll deal with him gu say
[1:50:51] listen here if thou return if you come
[1:50:55] back in peace like he had the same he
[1:50:57] came right back as as if the Lord just
[1:50:59] anointed him just shook him say if you
[1:51:00] come back if you come back the Lord has
[1:51:04] not spoken by
[1:51:06] me and he said Haren our people every
[1:51:10] one of you this is not just for Ahab
[1:51:13] this is for you for you for
[1:51:16] you this gospel is not just for brother
[1:51:19] Jean it's not just for the ministers
[1:51:21] it's not for the deacon it's for
[1:51:27] everyone five more minutes is that okay
[1:51:30] five more minutes I'm
[1:51:31] racing and uh so they Carri M away you
[1:51:35] know he's holding his mouth he's like
[1:51:36] well you know what I I preach the truth
[1:51:38] I don't care I preach the
[1:51:40] truth you got to be bold when you stand
[1:51:43] on God Dr Bo I preach the truth it's
[1:51:46] nothing but the truth that's the last
[1:51:49] voice they wanted he wanted them to hear
[1:51:51] was the Cry of Prophet
[1:51:56] Hallelujah sometimes as ministers we
[1:51:58] don't know if the word reaches the
[1:51:59] people we just lay the word we put the
[1:52:03] seed there
[1:52:05] God God and uh the king of Israel say
[1:52:10] yeah so jeos I know that was kind of a
[1:52:11] scene totally unexpected and
[1:52:15] uh so we still going to go to Rond
[1:52:19] gillad Joseph is like I I don't know man
[1:52:23] like I mean you heard what he said I
[1:52:25] mean God s the L Spirit to talk to 400
[1:52:28] prophets and you're going to die and you
[1:52:32] ain't worried about that right you're
[1:52:34] not worried like cuz he ain't say
[1:52:35] nothing about me like that that that was
[1:52:37] definitely for you
[1:52:39] like cuz I mean that would be the
[1:52:41] conversation I'll be having with him I
[1:52:43] mean I feel like I might be okay
[1:52:48] but and so the key's like well you know
[1:52:50] what you might have a point there
[1:52:53] okay so here's what we're going to do
[1:52:54] I'm going to disguise myself it's in the
[1:52:58] Bible he's like you bring up a good
[1:53:00] point so um I'm going to disguise
[1:53:03] myself something was
[1:53:07] there something was there he left church
[1:53:10] service he probably was like what what

[1:55:23] amended
[1:55:25] 32
[1:55:27] captains that had rued over his
[1:55:31] chariots saying fight neither with small
[1:55:35] nor great save only the king of
[1:55:40] Israel that's a big deal yes
[1:55:43] sir as if they say it wasn't sufficient
[1:55:46] of that the foot soldiers go did the
[1:55:48] bidding he picked he handpicked 32 of
[1:55:51] his best Elite captains these were the
[1:55:54] top Warriors within his uh within his
[1:55:57] military the top
[1:55:59] brass 32 captains and not only that
[1:56:02] these were the ones that rode chariots
[1:56:04] that mean they operate with speed and
[1:56:06] efficiency yes
[1:56:08] sir and they were identified to Target
[1:56:11] no one else no one else I don't care if
[1:56:13] they're popular I don't care if they're
[1:56:14] great I don't care if they're small
[1:56:16] don't Target no one
[1:56:18] else but Target that one person oh my
[1:56:22] [Music]
[1:56:23] we talking about Ahab but I'm saying
[1:56:25] Saints the devil treats you that
[1:56:27] way he has some of his best Elite
[1:56:30] Fighters oh my chasing you down yes
[1:56:35] that's why it's so hard in this battle
[1:56:38] that's why your that's why the Bible
[1:56:40] says he is my strength when I am
[1:56:43] weak because there are moments where I
[1:56:45] say Lord I could stand here but there
[1:56:47] are moments where I need you
[1:56:49] here because the devil knows your weak
[1:56:51] spot in he punches you there he kind of
[1:56:54] goes back to it and he makes you feel
[1:56:56] like you can't overcome he makes you
[1:56:58] feel like you're not anything he makes
[1:56:59] you feel like you're not a Christian
[1:57:01] that you're not a son of God that's the
[1:57:02] role of the devil when you get those
[1:57:04] thoughts shun those thoughts from your
[1:57:07] mind
[1:57:09] amen
[1:57:12] now Israel the king of Israel was the
[1:57:15] target yeah
[1:57:18] right and it came to pass when the
[1:57:20] captains of the Chariots saw
[1:57:25] Jehoshaphat I'm done Saints I'm done
[1:57:27] when they saw Jehoshaphat Saints let me
[1:57:29] tell you something be careful who you
[1:57:33] keep company
[1:57:35] with thank you Lord praise the Lord
[1:57:39] thank you Lord be careful who you keep
[1:57:43] company with right be careful who are
[1:57:47] your friends am amen
[1:57:52] amen don't make it difficult for the
[1:57:55] devil to not know who the target
[1:57:59] [Applause]
[1:58:03] is the Devils starting chasing
[1:58:07] Jehoshaphat right because he dressed
[1:58:10] just like Israel like
[1:58:12] Ahab there were buddies they kept the
[1:58:15] same
[1:58:16] company so those Devils started chasing
[1:58:20] Jehoshaphat and let me tell you Ahab was
[1:58:23] nowhere to be
[1:58:27] found Jehoshaphat started to run yeah he
[1:58:32] cried and it was not a Battle
[1:58:38] Cry he cried it was not a battle cry
[1:58:42] when you got 32 captains on chariots
[1:58:45] chasing after you you would cry too
[1:58:52] Ahab I know Ahab must have seen
[1:58:55] him you let me tell you you got to know
[1:58:57] who your friends are you got to know
[1:59:00] where you stand with God because your
[1:59:02] friends can be the one in the distance
[1:59:03] looking because they know they're the
[1:59:05] target yes yes yes and they see how this
[1:59:09] thing unfold why they they come help you
[1:59:11] they see what's going to happen to you
[1:59:13] I've been there before I've had some
[1:59:15] friends I thought they had my back oh
[1:59:16] they meant it way back
[1:59:18] right way way back when right here me
[1:59:22] and my boys and they're way over there I
[1:59:25] realize it's me by
[1:59:27] myself true be careful who you be
[1:59:31] careful who you have company with be
[1:59:34] careful who you associate yourself
[1:59:38] with that's why at work I don't have
[1:59:44] friends I'm not getting on your besties
[1:59:46] I'm not if you got that I just you work
[1:59:48] out your own salvation with friend I
[1:59:49] just don't got that I don't have that
[1:59:51] many friends amen amen come on I've had
[1:59:55] too many experiences I've matured along
[1:59:57] the way you've we've been through some
[2:00:00] stuff I've know I've come to a point
[2:00:02] where I just trust
[2:00:06] God it's me and my family against the
[2:00:09] devil and God's with
[2:00:11] me
[2:00:14] amen Joseph I cried can you just imagine
[2:00:18] what what went through his mind the
[2:00:18] moment he saw 32 captains chasing after
[2:00:20] him he's like this was a wrong idea
[2:00:22] he probably wish he was home right now
[2:00:24] but he's in the thick of battle with
[2:00:26] King Ahab chasing after ramth Gillan
[2:00:28] after he heard a sermon that was
[2:00:30] preached yes sir you hearing the sermon
[2:00:34] preach the devil's not in this building
[2:00:36] right now but he's right outside he just
[2:00:39] he's like service is a little long today
[2:00:40] man they should have been out of church
[2:00:41] by now should have been out of church by
[2:00:44] now he's just right at the door waiting
[2:00:46] for you cuz he he's waiting for you cuz
[2:00:48] you're right you're in the presence of
[2:00:49] God you're in the presence of the Angels
[2:00:52] he can't dare come in here so he's
[2:00:53] waiting for church to let out my God
[2:00:56] just waiting for church to let out
[2:00:58] looking to himself it's like it's 12:28
[2:01:00] preacher already lied he said he
[2:01:01] wouldn't be that long he's taking all
[2:01:03] the time of the
[2:01:05] world the devil's waiting but that's the
[2:01:08] reason why you got to be so guarded with
[2:01:09] the word of God that joy that you
[2:01:12] receive the moment you walk out the door
[2:01:14] punch the devil in the
[2:01:17] face and said I'm taking this Victory to
[2:01:20] my house I'm taking this this Victory to
[2:01:23] my job I'm taking this Victory to my
[2:01:25] home to my
[2:01:27] family praise the
[2:01:30] Lord
[2:01:33] am
[2:01:35] amen and the Bible says so when Ahab saw
[2:01:39] Jehoshaphat got away and the Kings the
[2:01:42] captains realized wait minute this ain't
[2:01:44] Israel they're like we're chasing the
[2:01:46] wrong person the devil don't like to
[2:01:47] spend their energy on what's not the
[2:01:49] target
[2:01:51] it it Jehosaphat was not the target when
[2:01:53] Jehosaphat cried a he's like no that's
[2:01:55] not him that sound like so they spun
[2:01:57] their chariots around they went looking
[2:02:00] for
[2:02:00] Ahab and Ahab probably was breathe a
[2:02:03] side of a relief he's like praise the
[2:02:04] Lord he probably left he's like you know
[2:02:06] what I'm going to go home they can
[2:02:07] finish this battle by themselves and
[2:02:09] Ahab was hiding and the Bible says a
[2:02:13] certain man God knows where you're
[2:02:15] hiding the Bible says a certain man Drew
[2:02:17] out a bow from a certain Venture this is
[2:02:20] in the midst of all this battle chaos
[2:02:22] ensuing people fighting everywhere
[2:02:24] everybody looking for Ahab he's
[2:02:25] disguising himself and the Bible says a
[2:02:27] certain man drew a boat out of venture
[2:02:30] just do it just cuz I'm going to help
[2:02:33] somebody let this Arrow fly my God that
[2:02:37] Arrow was flying that Arrow was looking
[2:02:40] for its distance let me tell you people
[2:02:41] must have been in the battle raging when
[2:02:43] that Arrow was coming out people moved
[2:02:44] out the way not realizing that they were
[2:02:46] moving out the way because the arrow had
[2:02:48] a purpose God was looking for it Target
[2:02:50] that Arrow was coming in and people's
[2:02:53] ounding him moving out the way and
[2:02:55] ahab's looking around cuz he's looking
[2:02:56] for somebody not
[2:02:59] something he's looking for somebody he's
[2:03:02] like I'm looking for the third two kings
[2:03:03] and not realizing and an arrow hits
[2:03:07] him unexpected God knows how to catch
[2:03:09] you
[2:03:10] unexpectedly you can't hide from God
[2:03:12] when he has a Target on you he's going
[2:03:13] to find you no matter where you're at it
[2:03:16] may not be a preacher that comes to get
[2:03:17] you it may not be a deacon that comes to
[2:03:19] get you but something is coming to get
[2:03:21] you
[2:03:22] amen that Arrow hits the side of
[2:03:25] Ahab
[2:03:27] unexpectedly the word of God comes to
[2:03:32] fulfillment he sat there
[2:03:36] bruised he was not expecting
[2:03:39] that he was not expecting
[2:03:43] that as we stand to our
[2:03:47] feet the Bible says and the battle
[2:03:50] increased that day
[2:03:52] and the King stayed up in his Chariot
[2:03:55] against the
[2:03:57] syrians and he died at
[2:04:02] evening he tried to hold
[2:04:05] on he tried to hold
[2:04:08] on he
[2:04:10] died at
[2:04:12] evening going back to naboth there was a
[2:04:16] prophecy that was over him that God had
[2:04:19] pronounced but because he had
[2:04:22] asked for forgiveness and repented of
[2:04:24] his ways the Lord held back but because
[2:04:29] of his ways the Lord went back to that
[2:04:31] prophecy and it was fulfilled
[2:04:33] here so the king died and was brought to
[2:04:36] Samaria and they buried the king in
[2:04:39] Samaria and one washed the Chariots in
[2:04:41] pool of Samaria and the dogs licked up
[2:04:45] his
[2:04:46] blood and they wash his armor according
[2:04:49] unto the word of the Lord which he
[2:04:55] spake Saints I Shar this with
[2:04:58] you these are trying times sir if
[2:05:03] there's ever a moment that we need to
[2:05:05] display who we are this is the critical
[2:05:10] hour things are unfolding in many many
[2:05:13] many
[2:05:14] ways whether we're talking about
[2:05:17] politics Society environmental yeah
[2:05:22] things are
[2:05:25] happening the moments are becoming more
[2:05:27] and more obvious where there's going to
[2:05:28] be a distinction a differentiation
[2:05:31] between you and the
[2:05:36] world where some of the things that the
[2:05:38] world is introducing it's just going
[2:05:40] back to the my example is just it's
[2:05:42] gut-wrenching they're eating it up but

[2:05:50] pot

[2:05:57] truth and if we hear for another 10
[2:06:00] years it's still the

[2:06:06] so convicted they say God will bring us
[2:06:11] Deliverance out of the fiery furnace and
[2:06:14] they had the boldness to look at the
[2:06:15] king he says even if the God doesn't we
[2:06:18] still will not bow down to your image
[2:06:22] amen even if the Lord sh ter I know the
[2:06:25] world is wrong and God is
