[53:15] accumulate
[53:17] over 32,000 dollars this year
[53:21] has just been real good Gator salute
[53:25] [Music]
[53:35] okay so our goal for the year was to
[53:39] raise two hundred and five thousand
[53:42] dollars
[53:42] [Music]
[53:44] that came for the year was fifty six
[53:46] thousand three hundred and nine
[53:49] what has been received of that has been
[53:51] thirty-one thousand four hundred fifty
[53:54] seven dollars in twenty one sin
[53:57] to give God praise for $37.00 21 soon
[54:07] thing is that we were able to gain some
[54:09] interest off the money that we have put
[54:11] away and we got a six hundred and five
[54:14] dollars in manifold sin and interest
[54:16] might have to pay a couple bills that I
[54:18] couldn't build six hundred and five
[54:19] dollars of interest but we thank God for
[54:21] that which gives us a total for this
[54:23] year in total there's no transfers we
[54:25] did now that means we didn't have to
[54:27] take the money from the building fund to
[54:29] pay our normal operating expenses God
[54:32] met our needs
[54:35] he's this year and I saw all the man
[54:37] it's been given to the building fight
[54:39] has been able to stay in the building
[54:41] fund and so our total that we've been
[54:43] able to save for this year thirty two
[54:46] thousand sixty three dot fifteen seven
[54:48] the skill got race
[54:52] [Applause]
[54:54] you know we're not a large car but look
[54:58] as much when God is in it right and and
[55:02] I just been seeing the hand of the Lord
[55:04] just moving and I said and as we share
[55:08] this you know update this is not for us
[55:10] to just talk about money we got the bank
[55:12] this is for the glory of God because our
[55:15] plan is to buy a building that's what
[55:19] that money is for is to buy a building
[55:21] that next month what I will do

[55:25] instead there in January and and I
[55:27] almost give you just I'll show you just
[55:30] through a presentation just a total
[55:32] amount that we have from last year and
[55:34] we had this year
[55:36] you know even from the year before but I
[55:38] know the Lord has allowed us to
[55:39] accumulate a roughly over seventy
[55:42] thousand dollars and I'm grateful for
[55:44] that
[55:47] for know where we were
[55:51] I've know where we come from it's times
[55:53] we couldn't get no more than five
[55:54] thousand dollars right and then we get
[55:57] that then we have to use it to pay some
[55:58] bills but the orders been so faithful to
[56:01] us and and when I when I look at I just
[56:03] I'm just I just believe that this is our
[56:06] seats
[56:07] sister-sister says the cops that we're
[56:09] in a new season now we have authority
[56:12] they man so I'm just leave this our
[56:15] season when you see the angel Lord
[56:17] moving like this you have to you got to
[56:19] get rid of the jump in man don't come to
[56:23] God with excuses I've been waiting years
[56:25] with it and I know it's time to jump in
[56:27] but angel orders moving now
[56:29] glory to God hallelujah so I'm just I
[56:34] don't I don't know how and wind I but I
[56:36] just I got my I got my faith on the line
[56:39] and God gonna bless us with a building a
[56:42] man and I still got a particular
[56:44] building in my heart that I'm looking at
[56:46] and they ain't been able to sell
[56:50] and they nobody else been able to buy it
[56:53] and I was talking to the realtor Nate
[56:55] told me some things that have happened
[56:57] with the build and they said I'm said
[56:59] they had sold the house they stole the
[57:02] apartments I say that's fine really we
[57:03] want a church and my belief is that and
[57:07] we get the church eventually going to
[57:09] get the house and we get the apartment
[57:10] we get it all ask that's what we ask God
[57:12] for right so I don't it doesn't matter
[57:14] that he bought it they can have it for
[57:15] now it's temporary
[57:17] right but we'll we'll take the church so
[57:21] they say
[57:22] in a we there's somebody has submitted
[57:24] an offer but we got to take it before
[57:26] the board because we don't you know know
[57:30] if the board are gonna approve that now
[57:33] and I say well you know what they just
[57:35] told me is that they did not like the
[57:39] often that was presented by the other
[57:42] person therefore they have to take it to
[57:44] the board to see if the Bourgogne
[57:45] approves that's gonna take a long time
[57:47] fools I mean they did not get the full
[57:48] price offer that's what they just said
[57:51] [Music]
[57:52] if they would take day off then maybe we
[57:55] can come up with an offer that they
[57:58] bought it can't consider
[58:02] [Music]
[58:03] it won't be what they asked it but it's
[58:06] a whole farm
[58:07] [Music]
[58:10] it's an offer so there's some number
[58:13] here somewhere then we gonna find that's
[58:16] gonna work for everybody praise the Lord
[58:18] so I'm the expectation Church I'll just
[58:21] keep it in prayer and the Lord would
[58:23] just watch over amen of this process and
[58:27] I'm just I I don't even want to say
[58:29] things like if that ain't it that God
[58:31] got something else for us I don't want
[58:32] to even talk like that that just seemed
[58:35] like I just put a look down there
[58:37] I ain't gonna say that until it's sold
[58:40] right maybe that wasn't it because you
[58:42] know when I when I when I bought my the
[58:43] house that we have we actually went
[58:46] looking at multiple houses and are
[58:48] closed many doors a man force and God
[58:51] knew exactly what we needed and when he
[58:54] brought us to the house that we have now
[58:55] every one of our
[58:57] we had so god no what are you doing I
[59:00] know that much I know that much but
[59:02] since it's available I'm gonna put my
[59:04] faith on it hey man I'm gonna put my
[59:07] faith on it so I'll keep it in prayer
[59:09] I'll keep it in prayer this you ain't
[59:11] over with
[59:12] y'all know what year this is
[59:15] right
[59:16] God can do something incredible around
[59:18] expectation brother Steven amen solder
[59:21] quits he's gonna come at this time
[59:22] indiscreet you in the name of the Lord
[59:24] Jesus a precious friend of mine from
[59:26] Indiana amen god bless you brother
[59:29] Steven god bless you precious Saints

[59:38] come for such a long time and I know
[59:41] many of you have come to Indiana and I'm
[59:43] so thankful to have you there with us
[59:45] and sing and brother Solomon was talking
[59:47] about his favorite singers brother Jack
[59:49] and brother Hammond I think he said but
[59:51] I have to say I agree with him except I
[59:55] don't know that other brother but my two
[59:56] favorite are brother Jack and brother
[59:58] Solomon so I had a treat this morning
[1:00:01] already and looking forward to what the
[1:00:04] Lord will have but as far as favorite
[1:00:06] singers there's on the female side he
[1:00:08] mentioned there's one of my favorites
[1:00:10] singing sitting here sister brother
[1:00:13] Jack's wife I mean mother and my I have
[1:00:18] to say my number one singer is my wife
[1:00:20] on the female side so she wasn't able to
[1:00:23] come but well we'll definitely try and
[1:00:25] bring her down and fellowship with you
[1:00:27] sometime soon so we as brother Jack
[1:00:30] mentioned we went to a back way and as
[1:00:32] he mentioned I had accepted the call in
[1:00:35] my life I'd been kind of avoiding it for
[1:00:37] a while and brother brother Nathan our
[1:00:39] pastor there the Church of the open door
[1:00:41] had been preaching for probably about a
[1:00:43] year on yielding and boy every service
[1:00:47] it was just hitting me and hitting me
[1:00:48] and oh Lord I know I don't want to hear
[1:00:51] it I don't want to hear it but after a
[1:00:52] while he has a way of getting through
[1:00:54] and I'm so thankful to be serving him
[1:00:56] and and in his will and I just wanted to
[1:00:59] mention a little story from when we were
[1:01:01] down there and back way you know brother
[1:01:04] Graham said in this age that the the
[1:01:05] love of many would wax cold and there
[1:01:08] what you wouldn't really find true love
[1:01:09] outside of this bride and I know in a
[1:01:12] message he in his presence he talked
[1:01:14] about how when you come into the
[1:01:16] presence of God that you want to go and
[1:01:18] tell someone you want to tell people
[1:01:20] about the Lord and you know when we were
[1:01:22] there in back
[1:01:23] we went about four years ago and I
[1:01:26] noticed out by the airport they have
[1:01:27] this grassy Airport that they built out
[1:01:29] into the sea and there's grass kind of
[1:01:32] all around it and there was this real
[1:01:34] nice playground and and the parents were
[1:01:36] there and their children were playing on
[1:01:38] the playground and it was just it struck
[1:01:40] me how wonderful the fellowship was
[1:01:42] amongst these people these were just
[1:01:43] people on the island and I was so sad to
[1:01:47] see this time when we went that that
[1:01:49] playground was overgrown with grass and
[1:01:51] nobody was there the parents were gone
[1:01:53] the children were gone it was just a
[1:01:55] sign of this time no matter where you're
[1:01:57] at the cultures changing and the people
[1:01:59] are changing and technology is coming to
[1:02:01] the island and so forth but we know that
[1:02:03] amongst the bride' that love is there
[1:02:06] and I just want to encourage you to stay
[1:02:09] the sweet group that you are keep
[1:02:12] pressing on and when one more testimony
[1:02:15] uh brother Jack was mentioned in the
[1:02:17] building fund over there they're
[1:02:18] building a building also and the Lord is
[1:02:21] providing and and they're doing what
[1:02:22] they need to do
[1:02:24] knowing they don't have everything in
[1:02:25] place yet they don't have all their
[1:02:26] money but on faith they purchased some
[1:02:29] land and on faith they got the bricks
[1:02:31] and they started laying the foundation
[1:02:33] trust in the Lord to bring them all the
[1:02:35] way through the end and we we were able
[1:02:38] to go at a time when they found out some
[1:02:41] information that some brothers in the
[1:02:43] u.s. had come together and had donated
[1:02:45] some money so they can keep the work
[1:02:46] going and put that roof on and I know
[1:02:49] the Lord's gonna be doing the same for
[1:02:51] your all's building fund I you know
[1:02:56] there's gonna be some trials I think
[1:02:58] back a couple years ago I bought a house
[1:02:59] we we had a house my wife and I for
[1:03:02] about ten years and we sold our house
[1:03:03] and we bought a new house and the
[1:03:05] interesting thing was is we had special
[1:03:08] permission to move our stuff into the
[1:03:10] house before the closing date and I
[1:03:12] thought well thank you Lord this is
[1:03:14] wonderful and as the offer was accepted
[1:03:16] there was other people that was wanting
[1:03:19] this house just like other people's one
[1:03:21] I guess this property and and and the
[1:03:24] real estate agent said there's showings
[1:03:26] lined up the whole weekend long and and
[1:03:29] said to the seller do you want to take
[1:03:31] this offer for mr. Soderquist and and
[1:03:33] the man said well I think I do want to
[1:03:36] he gave me my asking price that's what I
[1:03:38] wanted I'll take it and the real estate
[1:03:39] agent probably saw the dollar signs in
[1:03:41] her I said are you certain you got
[1:03:44] showings listed all weekend long
[1:03:46] somebody's gonna come in and give you a
[1:03:47] higher price and said no they gave me
[1:03:50] what I wanted I'm gonna give it to him I
[1:03:52] know that was the Lord but you know the
[1:03:54] thing is there was trials after that
[1:03:57] because we got this special
[1:03:59] prepossession our stuff was already
[1:04:02] moved into the house we had already
[1:04:03] moved into the house even before closing
[1:04:05] a couple days before closing and the I
[1:04:10] think it was two days before closing I
[1:04:12] got notice that I'd been laid off of my
[1:04:14] job my job had gone away and here I sit
[1:04:17] in this house losing my job before
[1:04:20] closing what and you know what Satan
[1:04:23] comes and says you know they're gonna
[1:04:24] you're gonna get to closing your night
[1:04:25] they're gonna find out your job got let
[1:04:27] go and then you're gonna have to move
[1:04:29] all your stuff and your family to some
[1:04:31] apartment you know and you get worried
[1:04:32] by that well I had never met this lady
[1:04:36] this recruiter I work in the IT field
[1:04:38] and she came and I reached out to her
[1:04:41] I'd never met her but I had heard about
[1:04:43] her and I reached out and I said I I'm
[1:04:45] in need of a job ma'am do you know of
[1:04:47] anything in my profession and she said I
[1:04:49] do I do know of something and so she set
[1:04:52] me up on an interview and it was with a
[1:04:54] company I had worked for before and I
[1:04:56] get onto this phone call on this
[1:04:57] interview and it was the man who had
[1:05:01] hired me before and he said come on come
[1:05:04] on back come on back so the Lord
[1:05:07] provided me the job we were able to
[1:05:09] close on the house and I just want to
[1:05:11] say friends the Lord is mindful of you
[1:05:14] and I'm so encouraged that brother
[1:05:16] Jackie you all have been able to raise
[1:05:17] these funds and I know he's going to
[1:05:19] take you the rest of the way god bless

[1:05:41] see it that way but by him moving the
[1:05:44] stuff in the house before the closing
[1:05:46] God was already trying to say this yours
[1:05:48] no matter what happened afterwards this
[1:05:51] yours don't move your stuff mine because
[1:05:53] he had he not moved his stuff here he
[1:05:55] might like to have done it after he

[1:09:56] if you have your Bibles

[1:10:03] and verse 16 appreciate the song service
[1:10:09] and the specials always enjoy it very
[1:10:14] much when we come here happy to be back
[1:10:18] with my Florida family man just 18 years
[1:10:28] met brother Jack and it's been a
[1:10:31] wonderful relationship I was just
[1:10:33] flipping through the thing with the
[1:10:35] minister sign and just seeing how many
[1:10:38] just how many times we've been together
[1:10:40] and just appreciate the Lord creating
[1:10:44] this opportunity brother Jack was one of
[1:10:46] the really the first minister that ever
[1:10:48] had me had me preached outside of you
[1:10:52] know my home church back in South Dakota
[1:10:54] and one other place just real real close
[1:10:57] friend of the family and before I'd
[1:10:59] really even accepted a call to be
[1:11:02] preaching but so I I appreciate this
[1:11:06] place very much amen
[1:11:08] so Luke chapter 16 and verse 16 the law
[1:11:12] and the prophets were until John since
[1:11:13] that time the kingdom of God is preached
[1:11:16] and every man presses into it it also
[1:11:20] turn with me to Philippians chapter 3
[1:11:22] we'll read verses 13 through 15
[1:11:27] Philippians chapter 3 verses 13 through
[1:11:30] 15 brethren I count not myself to have
[1:11:34] apprehended but this one thing I do
[1:11:37] forgetting those things which are behind
[1:11:38] reaching forward forth unto those things
[1:11:41] which are before I press toward the mark
[1:11:43] for the prize of the high calling of God
[1:11:46] in Christ Jesus let us therefore as many
[1:11:48] as be perfect be thus minded and if in
[1:11:52] anything you be otherwise minded God
[1:11:54] shall reveal even this unto you so even
[1:11:57] if you're perfect you should have this
[1:11:58] mind this mind is that you should be
[1:12:00] pressing toward the mark of the prize of
[1:12:03] the high calling of God in Christ Jesus
[1:12:05] you say well but but wait wait wait wait
[1:12:08] what is there to be what what is there
[1:12:10] to do after I'm perfect
[1:12:12] like
[1:12:13] haven't I arrived let's bow our heads
[1:12:16] for a word of Prayer Heavenly Father
[1:12:19] Lordan may you break down this scripture
[1:12:21] to us may you open our eyes to it Lord I
[1:12:23] was just seeing that a little plaque in
[1:12:26] the pastor's study about open the young
[1:12:28] man's eyes father I pray that you'd open
[1:12:29] the eyes of our hearts this morning to
[1:12:32] see your word to see our place in it to
[1:12:35] see how you have perfected us by the
[1:12:37] blood of Jesus Christ but father that we
[1:12:40] should never count ourselves to have
[1:12:41] apprehended but that we should continue
[1:12:43] to press the mark show us what that mark
[1:12:46] would be father that we would press
[1:12:49] towards it we ask it in the name Lord
[1:12:51] just just anoint us this morning
[1:12:54] anoint me to speak that may it be your
[1:12:56] words father I ask it in the name of the
[1:12:59] Lord Jesus Christ amen amen you may be
[1:13:02] seated so I want to take a title of
[1:13:09] press the mark now if I had slides or
[1:13:12] something like that you would you would
[1:13:14] see that I want to emphasize the mark
[1:13:16] I know that you've heard a hundred
[1:13:19] sermons on pressing and I know that you
[1:13:22] know it's it's it's fun to be an
[1:13:23] evangelist and evangelists like to come
[1:13:25] and stir the people up and get them all
[1:13:26] you know happy and you know Angela Starr
[1:13:29] kind of like grandparents right I mean
[1:13:31] you you send your kids to the grand you
[1:13:33] know grandparents and they show them up
[1:13:35] they get them all stirred up and then
[1:13:36] they send them back you know to the
[1:13:37] pastor back at home and then the
[1:13:40] pastor's got to deal with all that and
[1:13:41] you know and and then all the people
[1:13:45] like well how come you're not giving us
[1:13:47] candy pastors oh well because you know
[1:13:48] sometimes some of us gotta feed you
[1:13:51] something good you know so so I know
[1:13:54] that you've heard a hundred sermons on
[1:13:56] pressing and pressing the mark and and
[1:13:58] you know so as much as I would love to
[1:14:00] do that and you know well just frankly
[1:14:02] that's not me and you know it'd be just
[1:14:05] kind of awkward me trying to sit here
[1:14:07] and try to get you on your feet and try
[1:14:08] to get you all shouting and rushing the
[1:14:11] pulpit and things like that that's never
[1:14:12] happened to really ever when I preached
[1:14:14] I days it just doesn't happen
[1:14:19] because it's not me and I'm okay with it
[1:14:23] but what I do want to talk about is I
[1:14:25] want to talk about the mark you see
[1:14:27] because I believe that if we can
[1:14:28] understand what the mark is that the the
[1:14:32] the idea of the that I won't have to
[1:14:35] come if you get catch a vision of what
[1:14:37] the mark is I don't have to come here
[1:14:39] and feed you sugar and get you all
[1:14:40] stirred up and though Ya Ya Ya Ya Ya
[1:14:42] let's go let's press let's press no if
[1:14:44] you see what the mark truly is you'll be
[1:14:47] like hmm
[1:14:48] going I'm going you see see the problem
[1:14:53] of our pressing it's not it's not a
[1:14:55] motivation it's not our emotion it's not
[1:14:57] our you know where we're at but the
[1:14:59] problem most of the time is is that we
[1:15:01] don't go truly what the mark is and if
[1:15:04] we really look to what the mark is and
[1:15:06] values the mark and kept the mark high
[1:15:08] enough to where we realized you know I
[1:15:10] want that mark to be high
[1:15:12] I want that mark to be to be essentially
[1:15:16] unattainable because then I can continue
[1:15:19] to practice I can continue to press
[1:15:21] because if you have a high mark there's
[1:15:26] value have you bring down the mark and
[1:15:30] everybody can hit it well did you hit
[1:15:33] the mark today yeah I hit the mark today
[1:15:35] along with a bajillion other people you
[1:15:37] know good job good job you know it's
[1:15:39] like you know giving trophies to all the
[1:15:41] kids that played soccer whether they
[1:15:43] want anything or not oh did you get a
[1:15:46] trophy today oh that's so amazing
[1:15:50] you must be so good actually I got tired
[1:15:56] and I sat down and pick daisies and then
[1:15:59] the ball hit me in the head but I got a
[1:16:01] trophy yay
[1:16:02] yeah that's what happens you know and so
[1:16:05] and so even we we even recognize the
[1:16:07] kids the kids don't it's like oh yeah I
[1:16:10] got another certificate throw it in the
[1:16:12] thing with the rest of the certificates
[1:16:13] you know like it there's no value to it
[1:16:16] you know but but there were some things
[1:16:19] that my kids did you know I was
[1:16:21] surprised I when my kids were younger I
[1:16:23] said well let's do this triathlon and I
[1:16:25] thought there's no way you know cuz if I
[1:16:27] would have been there
[1:16:28] dad you want us to do a triathlon and
[1:16:30] that sounds lame you want me to run bike
[1:16:33] and swim long distances yeah no great
[1:16:39] idea dad
[1:16:40] you know great yeah but no but my kids
[1:16:42] were like okay yeah let's do this
[1:16:44] and my daughter actually got 2nd place
[1:16:46] and and and the only reason she didn't
[1:16:48] get first place is cuz the other you
[1:16:50] know we hadn't upgraded her bicycle yet
[1:16:52] and so the girl that actually won had a
[1:16:55] you know big you know person bike and so
[1:16:58] you know those wheels cover a whole lot
[1:17:00] more ground you know and she's like
[1:17:01] pedaling for all she's worth and she's
[1:17:02] got these little wheels and otherwise
[1:17:04] she beat her and you know both the run
[1:17:06] and the swim but anyway she remembers
[1:17:09] that she values that trophy cuz she
[1:17:14] knows she did well not everybody got a
[1:17:17] trophy and she you know and and then it
[1:17:20] got to the point where she was just like
[1:17:21] hey can we do those kinds of things
[1:17:23] again because she realized she was
[1:17:25] pretty good at it and she realized that
[1:17:27] you know hey there's trophies that I can
[1:17:29] earn that there's something in you know
[1:17:31] that something about me and my
[1:17:33] uniqueness and my individuality see I'm
[1:17:35] I'm pretty good at distance and I can go
[1:17:37] and press this thing and I can actually
[1:17:39] achieve something you see when and and
[1:17:42] so now there's value attached to it you
[1:17:44] see what we try to do in our age is try
[1:17:46] to lower the mark so often that's what
[1:17:48] our culture tries to do is lower the
[1:17:50] mark lower the mark lower the Mar you
[1:17:53] lower the mark use in then why do we do
[1:17:55] that in culture why do we lower the mark
[1:17:56] well we lower the mark because to keep a
[1:17:58] high mark is essentially interpreted
[1:18:00] this mean these days you know it's it's
[1:18:05] if one kid wins and one kid loses so
[1:18:07] that's mean to the to the losing kid
[1:18:10] well no it's not mean that just that's
[1:18:16] life that just happened
[1:18:18] you know nobody went over to the kid and
[1:18:20] like I'm gonna you know you know beat
[1:18:22] you while you're down like that would be
[1:18:23] mean okay but it's it's not mean to have
[1:18:26] a competition and have one person that
[1:18:28] succeeded more than the other the other
[1:18:30] would just say then oh you know what we
[1:18:33] need to work a little harder we need to
[1:18:34] try a little better we need to you know
[1:18:36] have
[1:18:37] more practice and then we could be
[1:18:39] feeling to what they feel right now but
[1:18:44] in in our culture we interpret you know
[1:18:46] well the higher the mark is the more
[1:18:49] values attached and that's great but if
[1:18:52] we bring it down see then everyone can
[1:18:54] achieve it's like yay everyone can feel
[1:18:57] worthless together and we all just hug
[1:19:01] ourselves right now and what's the
[1:19:04] what's the point of that see see then
[1:19:06] there's nothing that's mean but then
[1:19:08] there's nothing that's really worth
[1:19:10] doing right when you bring down the mark
[1:19:16] nothing's worth it you bring down the
[1:19:19] mark you bring down the thing that is to
[1:19:20] be achieved you bring down the value and
[1:19:23] then now we wonder why we have a
[1:19:24] generation of people who are totally
[1:19:26] depressed who are on on medication who
[1:19:28] are sitting there with hundreds and
[1:19:29] thousands of friends on their phone and
[1:19:31] lonely because we've given them nothing
[1:19:34] to do we've given them nothing to
[1:19:36] achieve the mark has come down so low
[1:19:39] like we can't even we can't even decide
[1:19:41] whether or not they're man or a woman or
[1:19:43] or you know I mean the mark has come
[1:19:47] down so far there's zero definition of
[1:19:50] anything in culture and if there's zero
[1:19:52] definition of anything in cultures and
[1:19:54] then nothing matters anymore so the
[1:20:01] point we're now even the feminists are
[1:20:03] getting mad at the you know the newer
[1:20:05] movie you know the LGBTQ movements
[1:20:07] because you know well there's well how
[1:20:10] come we can't be we can't be happy about
[1:20:12] being powerful women if it doesn't
[1:20:14] matter if we're women or men anymore I
[1:20:17] mean did you ever think you'd see that
[1:20:20] day
[1:20:23] why cuz the mark got brought down so far
[1:20:25] there's no there's no definition and if
[1:20:28] there's no definition there's no value
[1:20:33] now do you think culture doesn't has no
[1:20:37] way that it gets into the message has no
[1:20:38] way that it gets into the word of God
[1:20:40] you know if you do come out from under
[1:20:44] the rock and good morning I'm your
[1:20:47] wake-up call here it happens and if
[1:20:52] we're not careful we'll tend to bring
[1:20:54] the mark that we are pressing towards
[1:20:57] down and lower and lower because then
[1:21:00] everyone achieves then we can be one big
[1:21:04] happy church family you see in and and
[1:21:07] and to be quite honest unfortunately
[1:21:09] that's the mark that many of us have
[1:21:11] tried to to bring about in a church it
[1:21:14] is to say well the mark of a good church
[1:21:16] is to be one really big happy family and
[1:21:19] as long as we love one another and
[1:21:21] everybody's you know we just you know we
[1:21:23] have fellowships and we have food and we
[1:21:24] have you know and we have good worship
[1:21:26] and we have you know of course the
[1:21:28] preaching and and you know but as long
[1:21:29] as everyone's really United and happy
[1:21:31] then we're a good church is that the
[1:21:34] mark cuz if that's the mark and you're
[1:21:35] hitting it then great
[1:21:39] that's not the mark that's a good thing
[1:21:43] that's a wonderful thing to have and I
[1:21:46] hope your church has that but but but
[1:21:48] that's not the mark
[1:21:49] anybody shouldn't be able to achieve
[1:21:51] that but that's not the mark the problem
[1:21:57] is is when we think we hit a mark we
[1:21:59] tend to stagnate we tend to you know
[1:22:05] stop a lot I've hit the mark like we
[1:22:08] read in the scripture now as many as be
[1:22:10] perfect leave us minded Paul is telling
[1:22:13] us you you you need to feel like you you
[1:22:15] have to press Paul says I count not
[1:22:18] myself to have apprehended
[1:22:21] Paul says I myself have not hit the mark
[1:22:24] now now I just want I just let's think
[1:22:27] about who Paul is the first church age
[1:22:28] messenger you know a man who has so much
[1:22:35] revelation in his
[1:22:36] life that God gives him a thorn in his
[1:22:41] flesh now anybody else have that kind of
[1:22:47] Revelation you got a physical problem
[1:22:49] because you have too much revelation
[1:22:51] like that if you don't have this
[1:22:52] physical problem in your flesh you're
[1:22:54] gonna get a little prideful anybody okay
[1:23:00] but this man found that he has not
[1:23:03] apprehended yet so it was no problem for
[1:23:07] him to press he didn't have to wake up
[1:23:09] in the morning and go okay you know
[1:23:11] meditation get my mind on the right
[1:23:14] things visualize what I am supposed to
[1:23:17] do for today yes okay now I feel good
[1:23:21] and I'm going to press no he just he
[1:23:23] just knew there was so much there for
[1:23:26] him to attain there was so much of God
[1:23:28] for him to be able to press towards that
[1:23:30] it just it was just like oh man there's
[1:23:32] so I want him so much he's so amazing
[1:23:35] he's so great he's so righteous you know
[1:23:37] I mean what are you what are you looking
[1:23:39] for in the Millennium what what are you
[1:23:43] what are you looking for when we get to
[1:23:44] the morning what do you want the morning
[1:23:45] to be like what do you want the
[1:23:48] millennium to be like
[1:23:53] good food you're next so think okay what
[1:23:57] do you want the money knowing him to be
[1:23:58] like you don't know you guys need to
[1:24:02] think about this a little bit more okay
[1:24:03] we'll come back next time and we'll ask
[1:24:05] you she's laughing what do you want the
[1:24:07] millennium to be like peace and
[1:24:10] happiness we want peace and happiness in
[1:24:12] the lynnium right yeah why do you want
[1:24:14] peace and happiness in imodium because
[1:24:16] you're selfish you want it for yourself
[1:24:18] you know it I want peace and happiness
[1:24:23] alone well why well cuz I just really
[1:24:25] want that okay yeah that's good good I'm
[1:24:28] just teasing I actually told myself I
[1:24:30] was selfish one time so you know
[1:24:32] different than me so the curriculum what
[1:24:34] do you want what do you want millennium
[1:24:36] more manifestation of Jesus Christ okay
[1:24:39] like how so like you know how would you
[1:24:43] see that physically manifested what what
[1:24:46] is it you'd like to see he yeah he wants
[1:24:54] to be a musician the millennium why cuz
[1:24:57] he's not here he wants it for himself no
[1:25:01] he probably wants it so he can praise
[1:25:02] God so the really where I'm where I'm
[1:25:07] trying to go is this I I asked myself
[1:25:08] this time you know am I being selfish
[1:25:10] but like lord I just man bring on the
[1:25:12] Millennium Lord and then I started
[1:25:14] asking myself why what do you want the
[1:25:17] millennium well cuz I oh good food no
[1:25:21] it's happy there's peace there's there's
[1:25:25] you know righteousness we don't have to
[1:25:26] you know just like oh my I don't have to
[1:25:31] deal with that in the Millennium you
[1:25:33] know then I thought Lord am I being
[1:25:36] selfish why do I want these things and I
[1:25:39] begin to fit realize the reason I want
[1:25:41] these things is because I want Jesus
[1:25:42] Christ and if if the millennium is
[1:25:44] peaceful it's because Jesus Christ is
[1:25:46] there and made it so if the millennium
[1:25:48] has righteousness it's because Jesus is
[1:25:50] righteous and he made it so everything I
[1:25:53] like and everything you want about the
[1:25:54] millennium is
[1:25:55] cuz God has made it so it's because
[1:25:58] they're everything you wanted them how
[1:26:00] do the millennium is a manifestation of
[1:26:02] the character of God physically on the
[1:26:05] earth that's why you want the millennium
[1:26:07] is because you want God now many times
[1:26:09] we don't think through all that all that
[1:26:11] way it took me a very long time to come
[1:26:13] there and realize it's not just that I
[1:26:15] want peace but it's that I want peace
[1:26:16] because it comes from God that God is
[1:26:19] the source of everything that is
[1:26:20] wonderful in the Millennium so of course
[1:26:23] if I don't have all of that now then I
[1:26:26] want to strive and press for that
[1:26:27] because that is the mark I want to keep
[1:26:30] the mark high I want peace in my life
[1:26:32] now because why he gives it to me
[1:26:36] [Applause]
[1:26:37] amen
[1:26:39] so so there's a there's a mark that's
[1:26:40] high that we should press towards
[1:26:43] because it's who God is and I'll give
[1:26:47] you a little secret you know the closer
[1:26:49] you get to him the more you find of him
[1:26:52] to get we'll talk about that here just a
[1:26:56] little bit but but that shouldn't be
[1:26:58] defeating that should be exciting it's
[1:26:59] like man who you know it's like it's
[1:27:01] like you know going for Iran and getting
[1:27:03] five miles in and then realizing there's
[1:27:05] still like 10 miles left and I thought I
[1:27:07] was getting closer but well that would
[1:27:09] be and that would be pretty defeating
[1:27:11] feeling but that's for for me for sure
[1:27:13] like running that far are you kidding me
[1:27:16] like I always thought you know I'm gonna
[1:27:17] run to that stop signing you start
[1:27:19] running you know you get down to like
[1:27:20] two driveways away and you're like and
[1:27:22] that stop signs a long way away I set
[1:27:26] that mark way too high
[1:27:29] but that's not the way it is with Christ
[1:27:31] with Christ the closer you get to him
[1:27:33] the rhythm the more you find like wow
[1:27:35] there's so much more to get but it's
[1:27:37] amazing
[1:27:38] because you realize the journey has been
[1:27:40] wonderful and you realize wow he is he's
[1:27:44] just so much greater than I ever thought
[1:27:45] you know I don't think about the stop
[1:27:49] sign wow it's so it's so much redder
[1:27:50] than I ever thought it would be I'm so
[1:27:52] glad I'm here like no that's it's not
[1:27:54] even a comparison God gets more amazing
[1:27:57] and so you you you so it is your desire
[1:27:59] to have more of him grow
[1:28:02] but that is if you keep the mark high
[1:28:04] because once you've brought the mark
[1:28:06] down and you feel like oh I'm finally
[1:28:08] that I'm there and I'm good yay I'm a
[1:28:15] message believer so good to be here I
[1:28:19] have attained going in the rapture my
[1:28:23] name is written down and all these
[1:28:25] things are wonderful all these things
[1:28:27] are great but if that if that has caused
[1:28:29] you to stop pressing then you've missed
[1:28:31] what the mark should really be because
[1:28:34] the mark has not just come in sit on the
[1:28:36] Pew do the message thing say the message
[1:28:37] stuff clap at the right times rejoice at
[1:28:41] the right time say the right things no
[1:28:47] that's a low mark I'm glad if you've hit
[1:28:51] that mark praise God you should strive
[1:28:53] to hit that mark but that is not it that
[1:28:55] is not and you say no no no put up a
[1:28:58] brother Trevor you know isn't this a
[1:29:01] carrot on the stick you know you keep -
[1:29:05] you know you're riding on something in
[1:29:07] the horse and you keep the you have a
[1:29:09] stake and you keep the carrot and go the
[1:29:11] more the horse goes it doesn't matter
[1:29:12] the carrot is out on this end of the
[1:29:14] stick and he never gets there saying
[1:29:17] brother Trevor like you know I got the
[1:29:20] Holy Ghost like you guys been preaching
[1:29:22] to me you need the Holy Ghost you need
[1:29:23] the baptism of the Holy Ghost you need
[1:29:25] you new birds you you know and and you
[1:29:27] need to clean your life up and I've done
[1:29:28] all of those things and I finally did
[1:29:30] that and now you're telling now you're
[1:29:32] telling me now that I've got the Holy
[1:29:33] Ghost and you're like no I'm still not
[1:29:35] there you got to keep going is that
[1:29:36] that's just a carrot on the stick like
[1:29:38] when is it enough brother Trevor when is
[1:29:41] it enough brother Jack whatever and so
[1:29:43] so so make sure that your discernment is
[1:29:46] right here I'm not talking about your
[1:29:47] salvation I'm not talking about the
[1:29:49] purchase I'm talking about your life I'm
[1:29:54] talking about your purpose I'm talking
[1:29:57] about what what can define you even as
[1:30:01] an individual oh my I'm trying to get
[1:30:05] all these notes out and like one
[1:30:06] sentence and it's not working
[1:30:11] like we talked about if the world
[1:30:14] brought it low and there's no definition
[1:30:15] then then everybody's just a bunch of
[1:30:17] mush and nothing matters and if nothing
[1:30:19] matters there's nothing worth doing if
[1:30:20] there's nothing worth doing then what
[1:30:22] are you here for can you imagine that so
[1:30:28] bringing that back into the spiritual
[1:30:30] realm can you imagine sitting there
[1:30:31] having the Holy Ghost and feeling like
[1:30:35] whoa but I mean I've arrived and if I've
[1:30:40] arrived what's my purpose what am i
[1:30:43] doing what is there a value what is it
[1:30:47] that God is asking me to do now some of
[1:30:49] you would avoid that you want to avoid
[1:30:51] what is God asking me to do but I tell
[1:30:54] you if you're avoiding what God is
[1:30:55] asking you to do if you're avoiding the
[1:30:57] personal responsibility that God is
[1:30:59] calling you for
[1:31:00] then you're avoiding purpose if you're
[1:31:02] avoiding purpose you're avoiding value
[1:31:04] if you're avoiding value what are you
[1:31:05] doing you're bringing the mark down and
[1:31:11] when you bring the mark down you sit on
[1:31:13] the Pew like a puddle of mush all your
[1:31:16] message mush your Holy Spirit filled
[1:31:18] mush but you're just mush there's no
[1:31:20] definition there's no nothing there but
[1:31:23] what I'm telling you today is that God
[1:31:25] has a mark that's so high and so
[1:31:27] wonderful but then that he wants you to
[1:31:30] press and it talks about even you as an
[1:31:34] individual
[1:31:35] let me just for word you know like five
[1:31:37] pages into the notes and talk about this
[1:31:39] I don't we'll just let the Lord do what
[1:31:41] he wants a Christian is not a tool or
[1:31:46] some kind of mechanical wrench to a
[1:31:48] great big religious regime that's right
[1:31:51] a Christian is not some kind of tool
[1:31:52] that keeps a religious organization
[1:31:53] moving that that's not a Christian a
[1:31:56] Christian is to be christ-like and a
[1:32:00] Christian cannot be a Christian until
[1:32:02] Christ comes into the man the life of
[1:32:05] Christ in him then it produces the life
[1:32:09] that Christ lived and you do the things
[1:32:12] that Christ did did Jesus just sit on a
[1:32:18] Pew
[1:32:20] well Jesus went to church yes
[1:32:23] is that all Jesus did now let's let's
[1:32:28] let's reno the identified masterpiece of
[1:32:31] god we're always going to be that way
[1:32:33] because God is not a Sears and Roebuck
[1:32:34] Herman house he hasn't got a variety he
[1:32:37] makes one one way and one another but we
[1:32:39] must serve Him in the way that God made
[1:32:41] us and be glad and stay behind his word
[1:32:45] and that's the way God did it you see
[1:32:47] God has a uniqueness in you God made you
[1:32:51] a specific way and God had a reason to
[1:32:55] make you the way he made you this isn't
[1:33:01] just psychology this isn't just the New
[1:33:03] Age stuff everybody just hugged yourself
[1:33:04] and God made me lovely the way it's not
[1:33:09] just that no like they've taken that and
[1:33:11] perverted that but if there's nothing
[1:33:12] but the truth God made you a specific
[1:33:14] way God made God made my brother here
[1:33:16] his way and the way he teaches and
[1:33:18] preaches the message it's different than
[1:33:20] me and God wanted it that way
[1:33:25] you know I'll never forget you know I
[1:33:28] think it was the meetings I think 2014
[1:33:30] or somewhere around there it's it's me
[1:33:33] and brother Andrew Glover preaching the
[1:33:35] meetings together that's like a good
[1:33:43] joke
[1:33:48] you know I don't wear a size 23 shoe you
[1:33:53] know I mean you know you get me who
[1:34:00] doesn't get a crowd up and off their
[1:34:02] feet very much and rush in the pulpit in
[1:34:04] and you get Andrew Glover who like does
[1:34:07] you know and I'm like calm down people
[1:34:09] let's talk about the word you know when
[1:34:11] brother Andrews like come on raise the
[1:34:12] roof you know and and I'm just you know
[1:34:15] I'm this and you know brother Andrews
[1:34:20] except he only needed like two hops to
[1:34:22] do that and I could be tempted you know
[1:34:28] I could be tempted because you know as a
[1:34:30] preacher you know I hey I like that
[1:34:34] right there or that you're hearing you
[1:34:35] know who get up off your seat just a
[1:34:38] little bit more and rush the pulpit you
[1:34:39] know and come on I want you guys to do
[1:34:41] that because it man that would just make
[1:34:43] me feel like an amazing preacher the
[1:34:45] response I got out of the people oh my
[1:34:47] goodness and and if I don't get that
[1:34:49] maybe maybe just maybe I'm not as good
[1:34:53] of a preacher as brother Andrew Glover
[1:34:55] and I could get discouraged but God
[1:35:00] didn't make me that way
[1:35:02] he didn't give me size 23 shoe to hop
[1:35:04] across this you know into hops and get
[1:35:07] all excited and you know do that you
[1:35:09] know all the way around you think you
[1:35:11] know cuz when he does it you know y'all
[1:35:16] get like your mmm this is great and when
[1:35:19] I do it you laugh so I realized God
[1:35:25] didn't make me to do that but I'm not
[1:35:30] that's not that's not how God made me
[1:35:33] that's not the purpose that God shaped
[1:35:35] me for and that's fine that's good and
[1:35:38] maybe then I should just focus on the
[1:35:41] things that God put in me to do through
[1:35:43] me another quote here brother Ram talks
[1:35:47] about how they were cutting out the
[1:35:48] stones for the temple you know and
[1:35:50] they'd be slotting these little stones
[1:35:51] and he says you know maybe God had some
[1:35:54] some odd shaped stones I think is is
[1:35:56] that what he says God down through time
[1:36:00] has cut out some very odd stones that we
[1:36:04] might not have understood but they have
[1:36:07] their place exactly in the temple in the
[1:36:09] building of God and Joshua by instrum
[1:36:10] inspiration not by just mathematics he
[1:36:13] inspired by God he was talking about how
[1:36:14] they positioned Ephriam and these
[1:36:17] different things so so God has odd
[1:36:18] stones he says God in his master works
[1:36:23] no one could have ever done it but God
[1:36:25] there's no way of doing it gone alone it
[1:36:28] was to be theirs forever it was a gift
[1:36:29] from God by his marvelous grace give
[1:36:31] these people this land in this position
[1:36:33] and place them in it according to his
[1:36:34] word in the birth of the people just
[1:36:36] perfect and how it clucked right
[1:36:37] together and I think it was a type so
[1:36:40] what he's saying is is that maybe you're
[1:36:42] an odd stone maybe you'll feel like
[1:36:44] you're cut just a little bit different
[1:36:45] that you're maybe just a little bit
[1:36:46] different than other one as someone else
[1:36:48] and no I just wish I could be this
[1:36:49] person or like that person and you know
[1:36:51] what God made you that way God cut you
[1:36:54] that way because God wants to use that
[1:36:59] God wants to use how he made you to
[1:37:02] bring glory to his name God wants to use
[1:37:07] you he wants to use you and your
[1:37:11] uniqueness and your individuality then
[1:37:14] what a defense would it be then if we're
[1:37:16] to just well yeah I'm unique I'm
[1:37:17] individual but you know I got the Holy
[1:37:19] Ghost and so pretty Sean preacher
[1:37:23] because I have attained and I'm going
[1:37:26] there and praise the Lord comes even so
[1:37:30] come Lord Jesus I will sit and relax to
[1:37:32] you get here you see that's a low mark
[1:37:38] now you could say oh brother Trevor you
[1:37:40] just want us to press more no I want you
[1:37:41] to raise the mark up I want you to
[1:37:43] realize where the mark is and and you
[1:37:45] know what's so great about that is when
[1:37:47] you bring the mark up and it inspires
[1:37:49] you but then it also gives you the value
[1:37:52] then you recognize that God is valuing
[1:37:55] you more than he's valuing more than
[1:37:59] just sitting on a pill but he has enough
[1:38:00] value in you to to make you in a certain
[1:38:03] way that he wanted to use you in a
[1:38:05] certain way as you press the mark he
[1:38:07] then fills you with purpose and when you
[1:38:11] fulfill a purpose it's wonderful see
[1:38:17] when you take responsibility when you
[1:38:21] take responsibility now these days we
[1:38:24] look at respond man responsibility like
[1:38:25] everyone just wants to get out of
[1:38:27] responsibility right right
[1:38:31] okay well jesus paid it all I don't have
[1:38:33] responsibility no yeah not not in your
[1:38:35] salvation but doesn't he deserve you
[1:38:39] doesn't he deserve getting glory out of
[1:38:43] your life and if he begins to get glory
[1:38:46] out of your life you'll start realizing
[1:38:48] like this is the best thing ever and
[1:38:50] like you'll become like addicted to like
[1:38:53] God get glory out of me
[1:38:55] now that's one addiction that I'm
[1:38:57] probably okay with and then you'll feel
[1:39:01] wonderful about yourself and that's the
[1:39:03] self-esteem I'm kind of okay with like
[1:39:06] hey I just have you know I serve god I
[1:39:08] feel good about it and I love preaching
[1:39:13] I mean just you know my daughter always
[1:39:16] asked me what was the best part of your
[1:39:17] trip daddy it's always the same answer
[1:39:20] preaching we were just we were just in
[1:39:24] the Caribbean on a seven square mile
[1:39:27] island with beautiful beaches perfect
[1:39:30] weather
[1:39:31] amazing this amazing creation that if
[1:39:34] you've never been snorkeling or diving
[1:39:35] like you think you know like you've seen
[1:39:38] God's creation and then you you put your
[1:39:40] eyes underwater in the Caribbean and you
[1:39:42] recognize like I know nothing about the
[1:39:44] creation of God because there is a
[1:39:46] another world down here and it's just
[1:39:50] amazing but the best part of that trip
[1:39:54] was preaching as I loved serving him I
[1:39:59] love to encourage the people I love that
[1:40:02] God Church I love that God can use me
[1:40:10] me I know who I am I know what I've
[1:40:16] where I've been and what I've come from
[1:40:17] and I know what my faults are I know
[1:40:19] what my failures are I know that I still
[1:40:21] have to you know I still have to make
[1:40:22] sure my thoughts are right and that I
[1:40:24] don't think the wrong things and that I
[1:40:25] don't you know but God wants to use me
[1:40:32] God values me he shouldn't do that but
[1:40:42] he does and he has value in you and he
[1:40:45] wants to use you he doesn't want you to
[1:40:47] just sit stagnant but he wants this one
[1:40:50] thing that that you to be mindful of
[1:40:52] that you should press the mark because
[1:40:54] the more you press the mark the more God
[1:40:56] can use you the more God can use you the
[1:40:58] better you're gonna feel and the more
[1:41:00] wonderful it's gonna be and you'll have
[1:41:01] this great relationship with God and
[1:41:03] you'll be moving forward and moving
[1:41:04] forward and recognizing there's more of
[1:41:06] God to get and but God is using me more
[1:41:08] and more and more and it's just this man
[1:41:10] it's just this wonderful cycle that you
[1:41:12] feel better and you do more and are
[1:41:14] there gonna be hard times sure there's
[1:41:15] gonna be hard times but don't we value
[1:41:20] in your life
[1:41:21] they'll be purpose in your life why
[1:41:23] because you're taking a personal
[1:41:25] responsibility to press towards a mark
[1:41:28] that is really really high and you have
[1:41:33] to work at it and and we think that
[1:41:35] seems lame these days like oh you have
[1:41:37] to work at it like wow work is hard and
[1:41:39] I don't want to work I'd rather be lazy
[1:41:40] and and and it's like well that's fine
[1:41:45] but then you don't have a mark that
[1:41:47] you're hitting do you so you can be lazy
[1:41:50] you know it's like it's like kids in the
[1:41:51] summertime let me finish school and then
[1:41:55] you know what are you gonna do this
[1:41:57] summer well I've been working so hard
[1:42:00] you know like six hours a day they've
[1:42:02] been working so hard you know not like
[1:42:06] adults who don't get the summer off and
[1:42:08] we're working eight hours a day but
[1:42:09] they've been working so hard you know
[1:42:11] you know fifth grade math that
[1:42:15] you know what are you gonna do this
[1:42:17] summer a whole lot of nothing like I
[1:42:19] mean I am so wiped from 5th grade math
[1:42:23] that I'm gonna take two months off and
[1:42:26] I'm gonna hit you I'm not gonna do
[1:42:27] anything this summer and you get towards
[1:42:29] the end of the summer it's just like
[1:42:30] well hey how was your summer it's like
[1:42:32] well I didn't do anything like well how
[1:42:33] do you feel about that yeah I don't know
[1:42:36] like it's not really good like it seemed
[1:42:39] like such a good idea at the beginning
[1:42:40] of the summer but now I look back and
[1:42:41] like what I just wasted my summer like i
[1:42:43] sat in front of a screen and played
[1:42:45] video games and I didn't didn't do
[1:42:46] anything I didn't get anywhere I just I
[1:42:49] just sat there and became a puddle of
[1:42:51] mush all summer long and you asked you
[1:42:53] know you asked him like whoa did you
[1:42:59] enjoy it yeah no I guess not
[1:43:02] why well because they set a low mark and
[1:43:07] they hit it
[1:43:07] they hit the mark they said it was so
[1:43:11] such a low mark that they they
[1:43:12] themselves didn't even ascribe value to
[1:43:14] it after they hit it set the mark high
[1:43:20] and you'll feel good about trying to hit
[1:43:23] it you may not you may never actually
[1:43:24] hit it and as a matter of fact you won't
[1:43:25] hit it but the point I was saying about
[1:43:28] that carrot on the stick you know you
[1:43:29] think well you're saying who set the
[1:43:31] mark high and then we never hit it and
[1:43:32] won't that be depressing it's like is
[1:43:34] that is that really how small your god
[1:43:35] is that that that he's good with you
[1:43:38] just you know do you do the right things
[1:43:39] and then you're you know that's what you
[1:43:41] give him that's how small he is because
[1:43:44] I serve a god that's so big and so
[1:43:46] amazing and so wonderful that even if I
[1:43:48] never hit it like fine I'm diving in I'm
[1:43:51] pressing on I'm going high I'm getting
[1:43:54] more into him and more into him because
[1:43:56] it's wonderful because it has value you
[1:44:00] know we have the quote we often we often
[1:44:02] quote this to ourselves we we say you
[1:44:05] know well brother Branham says we're
[1:44:07] living far below our privileges we're
[1:44:08] we're living millions of miles below our
[1:44:10] privileges you know when these young men
[1:44:14] someday you know they're gonna want the
[1:44:16] privilege of driving and before they get
[1:44:22] keys to a car they're gonna have to show
[1:44:25] something
[1:44:28] they're gonna have to show there's
[1:44:30] responsibility that they can handle that
[1:44:31] privilege you know what does every
[1:44:34] parent ever said when the child comes
[1:44:36] and says I want to pet well you'll have
[1:44:39] to feed it you'll have to clean up after
[1:44:40] it you'll have to wash it you'll have
[1:44:42] you know there's so much responsibility
[1:44:44] that goes with the privilege of having a
[1:44:46] pet and then we read the quote in church
[1:44:49] we live far below our privileges well if
[1:44:53] we type privileges to responsibilities
[1:44:55] in life and then we read this quote and
[1:44:57] say well we're just living far below our
[1:44:58] privileges God has so much more that he
[1:45:00] wants to give us and pour out on us and
[1:45:01] we're just living far below it like how
[1:45:03] is it that we're living far below our
[1:45:04] privileges what is it well you know we
[1:45:07] want that pet in Christ what do we have
[1:45:10] to have responsibilities in Christ we
[1:45:13] want access to the keys and access to
[1:45:15] the car in Christ then maybe we're gonna
[1:45:17] have to have the responsibility in
[1:45:21] Christ responsibilities not a bad thing
[1:45:25] so this culture would try to say that
[1:45:27] laziness is a bad thing it gives you no
[1:45:31] value it brings you down to depression
[1:45:33] but responsibility in Christ can give
[1:45:36] you more privileges and God is happy
[1:45:38] with you and you're happier with you and
[1:45:40] everything's just happy why because
[1:45:43] you're pressing the mark and it's a high
[1:45:45] mark and you're not sitting around
[1:45:47] thinking well I've just attained I'm oh
[1:45:48] good I'm going there names written down
[1:45:50] praise God even so come Lord Jesus no
[1:45:52] I'm pressing the mark that I can have
[1:45:54] responsibility that God can use me that
[1:45:57] God can fill me yes even me God can do
[1:46:00] something through and how wonderful I
[1:46:02] mean I reflect on that it's like god
[1:46:04] that's so amazing
[1:46:05] use me more then put it yes Lord put put
[1:46:12] me in the harness and let me pull for
[1:46:14] you okay I'm pressing God see I'm not
[1:46:19] telling you to press telling you to set
[1:46:21] your mark I
[1:46:23] don't bring your mark down maybe I
[1:46:26] should put my notes down and look at it
[1:46:27] for just a moment here praise the Lord
[1:46:30] so a big problem is is that we think
[1:46:34] we've arrived so many times brother
[1:46:39] Branham says all our churches has sowed
[1:46:44] the winds they're reaping the whirlwind
[1:46:45] we don't have the prayer meetings we
[1:46:46] don't have the services we used to have
[1:46:47] what's the matter we've let down the
[1:46:49] bars on everything even to our
[1:46:51] Pentecostal churches setting full of
[1:46:52] bobbed haired women we've lay down the
[1:46:55] bars but the Branham says that little
[1:46:58] song you know we lay down the bars we
[1:47:00] let on the bars the Sheep got out but
[1:47:02] how do the goats get in you know our
[1:47:05] culture today is like sheep goats
[1:47:06] four-footed animals like who's to say
[1:47:08] once one which one we should keep this
[1:47:10] one in and that one out like that's ya
[1:47:14] know there's sheep that keep in there's
[1:47:16] goats that keep out the bars are the the
[1:47:20] definition the delineation of what is
[1:47:23] good and what is not good you have to
[1:47:28] set a high mark you know if you if you
[1:47:32] want to be an archer and you want to you
[1:47:34] want to be known as a good archer an
[1:47:36] Olympic you know archery you know
[1:47:39] professional what do you have to do we
[1:47:43] have to practice you have to train what
[1:47:45] are we talking about well there's a
[1:47:46] there's the circles on the wall back
[1:47:48] there you know and the small one in the
[1:47:50] center is the thing I got a hit and if I
[1:47:54] don't hit it it's like man I can barely
[1:47:56] see that little dot in the middle like
[1:47:58] can we just make that just a little bit
[1:47:59] bigger
[1:48:01] well what Olympian wants that like can
[1:48:05] you make that a little bit bigger I can
[1:48:06] hit it better so can everybody else so
[1:48:10] what does that mean what's the purpose
[1:48:13] of being a limp an olympian then come on
[1:48:16] church what's the purpose of being a
[1:48:17] Christian is that so you can go to
[1:48:20] heaven or so that you can hit us a mark
[1:48:22] so that you can train that you can press
[1:48:24] that you can go in and say God maybe
[1:48:28] myself I'll never hit that market but
[1:48:30] I'm gonna keep trying and I'm gonna keep
[1:48:32] training because God you're worth it and
[1:48:37] your wants everything that I can I can
[1:48:40] give to you you're worth everything you
[1:48:42] can get out of me because you gave me
[1:48:44] everything that you were not only did
[1:48:48] you give me your physical life and died
[1:48:50] on a cross for me but then then not even
[1:48:53] the physical blood that cleanses me but
[1:48:55] then you gave me your spirit that it
[1:48:58] could come and live on the inside of me
[1:48:59] and make this body make something good
[1:49:02] out of it make it an overcomer make it
[1:49:05] something that could press and actually
[1:49:07] hit a mark from time to time that's what
[1:49:12] it's about you know we come to a place
[1:49:20] where you know I think it was just a few
[1:49:23] days ago was the anniversary of JFK
[1:49:25] being killed and isn't that JFK that
[1:49:28] said ask not what your country can do
[1:49:29] for you but what you can do for your
[1:49:31] country I always thought man that's you
[1:49:33] know yeah preach a little while that's
[1:49:36] not just what God can do god I need this
[1:49:39] God I need this and oh god I need this
[1:49:42] oh god I need this but God what can I do
[1:49:45] for you today
[1:49:50] is anyone fit Church isn't he worth it
[1:49:54] but it's so hard the mark is so small it
[1:49:57] takes so much practice it drains me so
[1:49:59] much really really because with those
[1:50:02] responsibilities and as you you
[1:50:04] strengthen let me think about it
[1:50:05] think about look at look at how far
[1:50:07] you've come in your Christian walk yes
[1:50:09] you've come through trials and you've
[1:50:10] come through different things but but
[1:50:12] now let's take a moment and look back
[1:50:14] through your life and thank God I came
[1:50:16] through this and I came through this and
[1:50:18] God you used me here and what a
[1:50:20] privilege that was to do something for
[1:50:22] you and and then you begin to recognize
[1:50:23] that there's there's something that
[1:50:25] there's value that God is getting out of
[1:50:27] you and how wonderful that is that to
[1:50:29] know that God's getting value out of me
[1:50:31] and you know and instead of just being
[1:50:33] like well I'm just so glad that Jesus
[1:50:35] saved me and you know but I'm just you
[1:50:39] know I'm just the smallest of all
[1:50:40] Christians and I'm just you know I
[1:50:43] pretty much live a defeated life but but
[1:50:45] I'm so glad for the blood God wants more
[1:50:51] than that for you I mean thank God thank
[1:50:54] God that you can live that way if you so
[1:50:56] choose and then still go to heaven you
[1:50:59] know because yes God's blood did you
[1:51:01] know cleanse you from all sins and and
[1:51:03] and you know but but but then as you
[1:51:05] begin to look like well okay I'll try to
[1:51:07] do something for him and you know maybe
[1:51:09] I'll go and you know hey can I give you
[1:51:11] I just want you to have this this book
[1:51:13] or this tract and you know I did
[1:51:19] something for you Lord and you see what
[1:51:22] happens to your posture like like I'm
[1:51:24] not like this anymore
[1:51:25] but then I went and I was like here you
[1:51:28] go god bless you
[1:51:33] and and and and the more you do it
[1:51:36] you're like oh oh god bless you here I
[1:51:38] want to wanna give you something and you
[1:51:40] recognize it God man God's using me oh
[1:51:42] god bless you brother how are you you
[1:51:44] know it's certainly be good to be in
[1:51:46] service for the king isn't it I begin to
[1:51:49] feel pretty good about distance I'm hey
[1:51:54] you want a book let me tell you about a
[1:51:56] prophet and your shoulders roll back a
[1:52:01] little bit why because you're becoming a
[1:52:05] son and daughter of God and you're
[1:52:07] recognizing that a son and daughter of
[1:52:09] God they stand erect they they walk
[1:52:11] around like a son of the king even
[1:52:13] though there's all kinds of people
[1:52:14] sitting in slavery in the world but yet
[1:52:16] there's a bunch of people that are
[1:52:17] walking around with a different posture
[1:52:20] because they know they have value
[1:52:22] because they know they have purpose
[1:52:23] because they're fulfilling a
[1:52:25] responsibility in their lives that God
[1:52:27] is giving them and when they fulfill
[1:52:29] that purpose because there's definition
[1:52:31] that defines what is good they begin to
[1:52:34] recognize they are doing something of
[1:52:37] value and they don't have to be
[1:52:39] depressed like the rest of the world
[1:52:40] because the mark came down but because
[1:52:43] they kept the mark I and began to press
[1:52:45] for it man their soldiers came back they
[1:52:48] begin to recognize God values me and he
[1:52:51] wants to do something in my life and yes
[1:52:53] I'll give him everything yes so press
[1:52:55] tomorrow yes I'll keep going
[1:52:58] and that's what God wants out of each
[1:53:01] and every single one of you not only
[1:53:03] does he want everything from you but he
[1:53:05] wants to just continue to fill you and
[1:53:07] push everything that he is that is good
[1:53:10] into your life how good it is to be able
[1:53:15] to go back and go my even 10 years ago I
[1:53:18] was still struggling with this and
[1:53:19] struggling with this but God by His
[1:53:21] grace that's brought me so much farther
[1:53:23] and know I'm you know what I mean in one
[1:53:25] sense it's like yes I'm proud about how
[1:53:27] far God has brought me I'm not I'm not
[1:53:33] proud about what I did but I recognize
[1:53:35] it's that grace and I'm just so happy
[1:53:38] that God could have brought me this far
[1:53:40] knowing who I am and now I can serve Him
[1:53:43] like like people around the world
[1:53:45] actually invite me to come and preach to
[1:53:47] them what a crazy thought that is praise
[1:53:55] God I'm so happy to do it god I want to
[1:53:59] press tomorrow
[1:53:59] I haven't apprehended I'm not stagnating
[1:54:02] because I'm just sitting there feeling
[1:54:03] like I've done the thing I've got it you
[1:54:05] know god this is all you're requiring
[1:54:06] here you go I'm done happy day then you
[1:54:11] sit there and then things begin to creep
[1:54:15] into your life because you've just
[1:54:16] stagnated you're not pressing you're not
[1:54:17] doing anything
[1:54:18] you begin to you begin to lose the the
[1:54:21] value you begin to lose the purpose you
[1:54:24] you begin to lose the vision and then
[1:54:26] then well I'm not well what are you
[1:54:29] doing for him well I don't know I mean
[1:54:30] kind of bored in the evenings and so I
[1:54:32] just you know I just play video games
[1:54:33] that's what I'm a Christian okay good I
[1:54:37] mean fine and then you know then things
[1:54:42] just start coming in your life because
[1:54:44] you've stagnated because you're not
[1:54:45] striving because there's no value
[1:54:47] anymore and you're just kind of you're
[1:54:48] just sitting and existing and you know
[1:54:52] then fashion of the world comes in and
[1:54:55] then music and violence and garbage you
[1:55:02] know we started we were talking there in
[1:55:08] Sunday school about you know about God
[1:55:10] being personal
[1:55:11] God is very personal do you know
[1:55:14] wonderful that is that God is so
[1:55:17] personal he wants to live through you he
[1:55:20] doesn't want you to just come and sit
[1:55:22] and be religious that's not what God
[1:55:24] wants God didn't want to just hey
[1:55:26] everybody conform to the moral code that
[1:55:28] I tell you is right and then if you do
[1:55:30] it good enough and because you couldn't
[1:55:33] I I cleaned you and then I'll take you
[1:55:35] to heaven as long as you believe that
[1:55:37] and try well he's got lofty expectations
[1:55:44] if that's who your God is that small
[1:55:48] little God that you made up in your mind
[1:55:49] but that's not the God of the Bible it's
[1:55:51] the God of the Bible that is amazing God
[1:55:53] he's a big God he's a great God he's the
[1:55:57] author of every everything he made you
[1:56:03] and that amazing wonderful marvelous God
[1:56:07] wants to live inside of you and use you
[1:56:10] to bring him more glory like yes God
[1:56:17] that sounds you know what you know next
[1:56:20] summer
[1:56:20] that sounds better than anything I had
[1:56:22] planned amen serving you or sitting
[1:56:28] there doing nothing
[1:56:28] hmm well if you recognize the value of
[1:56:35] the mark there won't be you won't have
[1:56:40] to have the sermon that yells you'll
[1:56:42] press people press you've got a press
[1:56:44] and you gotta press and you gotta you
[1:56:46] know that you don't need that sermon
[1:56:47] because you're like hey cut that's so
[1:56:49] amazing I can't I just lay I wait I get
[1:56:51] to press yay let's press cuz I want to
[1:57:00] hallelujah see the problem is is that
[1:57:04] and I how long have I been preaching
[1:57:06] somebody just somebody just be honest
[1:57:08] with me
[1:57:08] how long have I been preaching it's
[1:57:12] 12:30 what time do I get called out oh
[1:57:14] my goodness
[1:57:17] all right let me I don't know all right
[1:57:20] all right yeah we got a couple more
[1:57:21] things that we want to cover okay so so
[1:57:23] let's talk about a mark that we that we
[1:57:25] bring down and one of the marks that I
[1:57:27] feel strongly that we we tend to bring
[1:57:29] it's we is we well it's the mark of
[1:57:31] message culture and and or the mark of
[1:57:34] our church culture and if we hit the
[1:57:35] church culture you know if all the
[1:57:36] sisters do the things that the other
[1:57:37] sisters do and all the brothers do the
[1:57:38] things that the other brothers do and
[1:57:40] then you know well we're just you know
[1:57:42] we're just pretty good spirit and truth
[1:57:44] Tabernacle Saints it's like well good
[1:57:45] and if you've hit that mark praise the
[1:57:47] Lord that's wonderful you know but then
[1:57:49] you begin to look at the others and you
[1:57:50] go wow they they don't do it like we do
[1:57:53] well then you have a problem because
[1:57:55] it's like well did I hit the mark are
[1:57:56] they not hitting the mark or what's
[1:57:58] what's the issue so then we come to
[1:58:00] message culture you know like I've
[1:58:01] talked about and we we kind of feel like
[1:58:03] yeah as long as I do the messaging
[1:58:05] things and I say the message e things
[1:58:06] where the message e things that I'm good
[1:58:10] and then then we stagnate we stop there
[1:58:12] and we go well I've arrived because I've
[1:58:14] hit this mark of culture and then when
[1:58:17] we find other churches that don't have
[1:58:19] this message culture that the same maybe
[1:58:21] there's just little bits that are
[1:58:23] different you know and then then then
[1:58:25] what do we do will we recognize well
[1:58:26] well now there's a problem so so yes as
[1:58:32] your pastor says you either lower the
[1:58:33] mark so that everybody can just be okay
[1:58:35] or what we begin to try to do is we
[1:58:40] begin to try to say well but our message
[1:58:41] mark is right so we want to get you know
[1:58:44] everyone else to the same message mark
[1:58:46] and you know how we do that well we do
[1:58:50] we do that with our own culture you know
[1:58:52] it's it's funny you know we'll just well
[1:58:56] just come over into our culture see and
[1:58:58] we'll then you'll have hit the mark and
[1:59:00] then you then you can stop pressing
[1:59:01] because you'll have hit the mark see we
[1:59:06] went on we were in South Carolina
[1:59:08] brother Luke's church and we were
[1:59:10] fellowship and with one of the young
[1:59:11] brothers whose deacon and get along
[1:59:14] really good with their family and they
[1:59:15] had a few families over and we were just
[1:59:16] having having a nice time and they have
[1:59:17] this they have you know they're kind of
[1:59:20] country folk in there
[1:59:21] out there you know in the sticks of
[1:59:24] South Carolina and and they're on this
[1:59:26] you know kind of farm and they've got
[1:59:28] the sheepdog
[1:59:29] and they were kind of laughing because
[1:59:32] they were there you know they were
[1:59:34] almost they weren't taking bets because
[1:59:35] they you know but they were kind of like
[1:59:37] cuz we don't do that but it was like you
[1:59:40] know you know but we say of course you
[1:59:42] know how much you want to bet that
[1:59:43] didn't you know the the sheepdog nips
[1:59:46] brother Trevor's heel this time because
[1:59:48] this dog was notorious for you know for
[1:59:51] because that's what sheepdogs do you
[1:59:53] know they they try to corral sheep
[1:59:55] together by nipping at their heels you
[1:59:56] know so so this dog just trying to
[1:59:58] fulfill its nature apparently like it
[2:00:00] could be off at the front you know very
[2:00:02] very front of the property you know a
[2:00:04] hundred yards from the from the door and
[2:00:06] they said you know and if you're walking
[2:00:08] in you know and you walk up the steps
[2:00:10] and in turn and to go in the door that
[2:00:13] dog will shoot from the from the front
[2:00:15] of the property and jump up onto that
[2:00:17] porch and nip your heel just as you're
[2:00:19] going in the door I said you won't know
[2:00:21] it you're like the dog was nowhere near
[2:00:23] me how did in and they'll come and it'll
[2:00:24] nip it you're healing and they were like
[2:00:26] I bet I bet it's gonna get brother
[2:00:28] Trevor this time and I thought Lord what
[2:00:30] am I gonna do is this dog nips at my
[2:00:34] heel and it's Saturday you know when I'm
[2:00:35] preaching twice the next day you know if
[2:00:37] this dog nips at my heel I'm gonna kill
[2:00:38] their dog and then I'm gonna be
[2:00:39] preaching to them later and I'm just not
[2:00:41] sure how that's gonna go so I really
[2:00:45] hope this dog doesn't nip me in the heel
[2:00:46] because I'll have to try you know to
[2:00:49] react you know differently than my
[2:00:53] nature disposes me to act and it will
[2:00:55] certainly be a trial so then they're
[2:01:02] like well let's take a walk you know and
[2:01:03] down the country road so we take a walk
[2:01:05] guess what the dog comes you know so
[2:01:07] there's like a good 12 14 of us you know
[2:01:09] just chatting and and you know so my
[2:01:12] family's there and and everybody's like
[2:01:14] I don't you know how about that stop
[2:01:15] biting me and I'm like we'll just stay
[2:01:17] in the middle you know cuz that's what
[2:01:19] the dog wants he wants everybody to stay
[2:01:21] in the middle of the pack you know just
[2:01:22] just stay in the middle and you're fine
[2:01:24] according to this dog you know so I mean
[2:01:26] of course we're like see you dog
[2:01:32] mmm-hmm I'm watching you dog I mean it's
[2:01:35] the most uncomfortable walk I've ever
[2:01:36] been on
[2:01:37] well we just you know my whole family's
[2:01:40] just like you know we're we're not
[2:01:41] petrified of this dog you know I guess
[2:01:43] we enjoyed the walk but you know just
[2:01:45] like I'm sure would have been better the
[2:01:46] dog wouldn't there and isn't that what
[2:01:51] we try to do we try to nip at people's
[2:01:53] heels to get them in the pack and that's
[2:01:57] what we try to get them to we try to get
[2:02:00] them to this very very low mark that is
[2:02:01] message culture just care get in my
[2:02:04] message culture and everything will be
[2:02:05] fine here just sit here you see isn't
[2:02:09] that just seeds of denomination right
[2:02:10] there just here just we bring down the
[2:02:12] mark to where it's this message culture
[2:02:13] and try to get people into it by like
[2:02:15] because we're message sheep dogs so you
[2:02:19] have to first in your mind have set that
[2:02:21] mark very very low it's higher than that
[2:02:25] it's higher than that so what God wants
[2:02:28] to tell you today is he wants he wants
[2:02:30] you to step up he wants you to see that
[2:02:33] the mark is higher than you with been
[2:02:34] thinking it and and to not get
[2:02:37] complacent to not sit here and and
[2:02:39] stagnate because you you've hit
[2:02:41] something and if you're sitting here and
[2:02:43] you're thinking well churches like the
[2:02:44] same like we enjoy it we have great
[2:02:46] music and but church has kind of been
[2:02:48] the same for me for the last I don't
[2:02:50] know three to five years so I asked a
[2:02:54] question when's the last time you
[2:02:55] pressed what is the last time you really
[2:03:00] felt like you pressed and if you haven't
[2:03:03] pressed why haven't you pressed it's not
[2:03:04] that I'm saying church start pressing
[2:03:06] you know you're you're lazy quit quit
[2:03:08] being lazy and press that's that's not
[2:03:10] what I'm saying
[2:03:11] but I would ask you if you feel like
[2:03:14] well it's been a long time since I
[2:03:16] really feel like I've pressed the mark
[2:03:18] why it's because you brought the mark
[2:03:23] down and you feel like you arrived but
[2:03:27] if you set that mark higher you set the
[2:03:29] mark of the prize of the high calling of
[2:03:32] God in Christ Jesus it is a high calling
[2:03:34] that God has called you to he didn't
[2:03:37] call you to a low calling he values you
[2:03:39] much more than that he called you to a
[2:03:40] high calling of
[2:03:42] of the prize of the mark in the in
[2:03:44] Christ Jesus it's a high calling he's
[2:03:46] asked you to press he's asked you to
[2:03:48] press because the mark is so high so if
[2:03:50] you haven't pressed I would say it's
[2:03:52] probably an indicator that you set the
[2:03:54] mark too low Church set the mark I he's
[2:04:02] so great he's so big he's so high how do
[2:04:05] we how do we instead of but but but
[2:04:07] instead of the unite because we're
[2:04:08] concerned about other people you know
[2:04:09] and we want them we begin to press the
[2:04:11] mark we want them to press the mark and
[2:04:13] that's that's great we want to fix other
[2:04:14] people's marks you know that's Noble
[2:04:17] that's Noble I mean that's what I'm
[2:04:22] trying to do right now so I can't say
[2:04:23] anything against it but but but where's
[2:04:28] this quote here from sudden secret going
[2:04:31] away of the church how could we help
[2:04:33] other people set their mark higher
[2:04:37] brother branham says it's not up to the
[2:04:39] Branham tabernacle neither is up to any
[2:04:40] church it's up to you as an individual
[2:04:42] to be ready at the coming of the Lord
[2:04:44] you must be ready I'll sweep my own
[2:04:48] steps it's up to you to sweep your steps
[2:04:51] leave mine alone me leave yours alone
[2:04:54] you've got to make your garment ready
[2:04:56] now if you think about this quote you
[2:04:59] know you would think well it's in it I'm
[2:05:00] just like hey sweep your steps no don't
[2:05:04] you worry about my steps you sweep your
[2:05:05] steps I'm dealing with mine you deal
[2:05:07] with your you know that seems kind of
[2:05:08] mean doesn't it seems like we don't care
[2:05:11] about that person you leave mine alone
[2:05:13] I'll leave yours alone doesn't sound
[2:05:16] Christian does it but what happens let's
[2:05:20] let's think about this though what
[2:05:21] happens if you begin to sweep your steps
[2:05:24] and you you know you get you get that
[2:05:27] broom and you get to the front porch and
[2:05:29] you you start sweeping and you realize
[2:05:31] there's color there that you haven't
[2:05:32] seen in many years and it's kind of nice
[2:05:35] and you get the dirt you know off that
[2:05:37] top step you see the dirt comes from the
[2:05:39] ground and it comes up the steps and and
[2:05:42] you know you can think about that is
[2:05:44] like coming through your heart and out
[2:05:45] you know on to the physical okay so your
[2:05:49] first step and you begin to sweep it you
[2:05:51] know and you get the DVDs that you
[2:05:52] shouldn't have any
[2:05:53] music that you shouldn't have in you
[2:05:54] know you get the makeup and you get the
[2:05:56] the the jewelry and that all of this is
[2:05:59] and that all of that sand you get it out
[2:06:02] you sweep it off all these things that
[2:06:06] that effect you know that people could
[2:06:08] see and you clean that step and then you
[2:06:13] would go down to the next step and you'd
[2:06:14] start cleaning that step you know you
[2:06:16] start getting bitterness and malice and
[2:06:18] jealousy and you know all these things
[2:06:20] that cause the problems up the step you
[2:06:22] know because you brought that you bought
[2:06:24] the dirt from the the ground of your
[2:06:27] heart you know and you brought it up the
[2:06:28] step still to where it's manifested you
[2:06:30] know and so now you begin to get down a
[2:06:32] little bit deeper and that that's where
[2:06:33] it gets a lot harder sweep in that step
[2:06:35] and then you would go even deeper and
[2:06:38] really get into it in the pride and
[2:06:39] arrogance and you know God starts
[2:06:41] showing you maybe you're not as great of
[2:06:43] a Christian as you really thought you
[2:06:44] were and you know maybe you need to get
[2:06:45] rid of that pride before I can actually
[2:06:47] use you you know and so you start
[2:06:50] sweeping that step but but you know the
[2:06:51] problem is is that when you begin to do
[2:06:53] that see there's there's to the reaction
[2:06:55] of two types that people can have they
[2:06:57] can walk by your steps and go ma look at
[2:06:59] those steps wait look at mine ma no mine
[2:07:04] are dirty but you know last week our
[2:07:07] steps look the same but now I see
[2:07:10] something going on here
[2:07:12] now there's two reactions people are
[2:07:14] gonna say what do you think you're doing
[2:07:16] well you think your steps are better
[2:07:18] than mine don't you or the other thing
[2:07:24] they're gonna do is like those steps
[2:07:31] look good what you've been doing well
[2:07:34] been sweeping them what I've been you
[2:07:38] know I've been really trying I've been
[2:07:40] really you don't strive in every I've
[2:07:41] really been pressed and I realize say
[2:07:43] that God wants more out of me and and
[2:07:45] and and instead of them saying like you
[2:07:48] you saying I'm not doing an office like
[2:07:50] man I'm nuts I'm not saying anything
[2:07:51] about you I'm saying I strove and swept
[2:07:57] my steps because I realized MA
[2:08:02] my steps were dirty we're in those
[2:08:05] sentences did you did you hear that I
[2:08:08] thought your steps were dirty I swept my
[2:08:13] steps because God showed me they were
[2:08:16] dirty so instead of them and you can't
[2:08:26] help that you know and so here's the
[2:08:27] thing is that you're gonna you're in a
[2:08:28] suffer persecution when you sweep your
[2:08:30] steps who you think you are
[2:08:33] oh you think you're just some prayer
[2:08:34] warrior don't you oh just trying to do
[2:08:42] what God asked me to do I'm trying to
[2:08:46] take it to another level oh you're
[2:08:47] saying I'm not there no I didn't say
[2:08:53] that see many people begin to hear those
[2:08:56] things you see so you're gonna suffer
[2:08:58] some persecution when you and maybe
[2:09:00] that's the reason we don't do that is
[2:09:01] because again we set the mark is the
[2:09:02] made big happy family
[2:09:04] we want the happy family you know pastor
[2:09:08] don't preach something to preach so hard
[2:09:10] you know we got some people struggling
[2:09:12] with that and we we don't want to offend
[2:09:13] them well I mean I'm not for preaching
[2:09:15] hard just to you know push people out of
[2:09:17] the church but but the mark is the high
[2:09:20] calling of God in Christ Jesus it's not
[2:09:23] to just keep us all happy and then
[2:09:24] hopefully by little you know however
[2:09:27] your church is gonna grow but the church
[2:09:28] should grow in grace and in holiness
[2:09:31] amen so so you sweep your steps and then
[2:09:34] people get kind of offended but but the
[2:09:36] other but the other reaction would be
[2:09:39] those look way better than my steps why
[2:09:43] well I started sweeping and I realized I
[2:09:47] had some things that were covering those
[2:09:48] steps and when I when I got the broom
[2:09:51] out and started doing it I could see the
[2:09:53] color honey yeah we got a boom yeah give
[2:09:58] me that broom Hey that's amazing
[2:10:03] I want my steps to look clean to sweep
[2:10:06] your steps other people catch the vision
[2:10:11] you don't have to you don't have to
[2:10:13] worry about it just sweep your sis just
[2:10:14] you know don't worry about everybody
[2:10:15] else press the mark Church don't worry
[2:10:19] about other people's marks you send the
[2:10:21] mark hi they're gonna recognize that guy
[2:10:24] is striving for perfection he's aiming
[2:10:26] at something high and I'm just sitting
[2:10:28] here going like is there a target over
[2:10:30] there like and they're gonna go well
[2:10:32] maybe I should practice maybe I should
[2:10:34] try to strive maybe I should you know
[2:10:36] maybe I should put on a suit and a tie
[2:10:37] and you know and really press in and no
[2:10:40] disregards to somebody who's not wearing
[2:10:41] a suit and tie but I'm just you know I'm
[2:10:43] just saying you know we raise a standard
[2:10:45] in some way we step up in some way and
[2:10:48] we strive a little higher and we get a
[2:10:50] little higher into Christ and then we
[2:10:51] keep pressing and we keep pressing and
[2:10:54] it doesn't stop but it's never tiring
[2:10:58] it's never depressing it's actually the
[2:11:01] opposite of that and our culture today
[2:11:03] would like to try to tell you that that
[2:11:05] trying something and trying to do hard
[2:11:07] is it's boring and difficult and just
[2:11:11] stop because everybody will like you
[2:11:13] better anyway if you don't you know show
[2:11:14] them up well I'm not trying to say show
[2:11:18] up a bunch of other Christians but I'm
[2:11:21] but I'm gonna show up for God
[2:11:26] so let's get rid of this stuff in our
[2:11:28] lives let's press the mark let's see
[2:11:31] here what have I not gone through in
[2:11:34] these notes yeah praise Lord so what are
[2:11:40] some of the what are some of the lies
[2:11:41] that you would tell yourself to say well
[2:11:43] I can't do that by the shopper I can't
[2:11:44] you know God could use other people but
[2:11:47] he can't use me because that's maybe
[2:11:48] where some of you are at and that's just
[2:11:51] but that's just a lie you know you think
[2:11:54] about the seventh church age messenger
[2:11:55] you know brother Branham you know born
[2:11:57] in a cabin in Kentucky to you know an
[2:11:59] alcoholic dad well what's his pedigree
[2:12:02] what's his was he look at and say you
[2:12:06] know yeah that's why God can use me
[2:12:07] because X no God can use me because he
[2:12:09] chose me that's that's what lie is it
[2:12:12] you know I mean you think about Moses
[2:12:15] you know he tried and killed a man and
[2:12:18] epically failed but God turned it around
[2:12:22] right what lie are you telling us I'm
[2:12:26] not good enough well God could not even
[2:12:28] use Samson I'm not good enough David
[2:12:31] fell and and and God got still used him
[2:12:33] a church God wants to use you even you
[2:12:41] in your own peculiarities your own
[2:12:43] uniqueness your own faults God still can
[2:12:47] use you in spite of all of those things
[2:12:48] and through all of those things and make
[2:12:51] you into something wonderful his
[2:12:53] strength is perfected in your weakness
[2:12:56] so don't lie to yourself don't feel like
[2:13:00] you've attained because Paul says I
[2:13:03] don't count myself to it to have
[2:13:05] apprehended amen because you're living
[2:13:10] instrumentality of God because you're
[2:13:14] the final voice to the final age under
[2:13:16] your messenger because you're the ones
[2:13:19] not this church but you as an individual
[2:13:21] you as an individual are coming up to a
[2:13:23] place where you are the super race the
[2:13:25] super church as you near him because you
[2:13:30] can be that spirit born spirit filled
[2:13:32] man that takes the Word of God into
[2:13:34] their heart and places it upon his lips
[2:13:36] and faith
[2:13:38] places upon his lips that's the same as
[2:13:41] deity speaking it's a high calling God
[2:13:47] don't just trust that to someone who
[2:13:49] hasn't pressed to hasn't strove you
[2:13:52] don't you don't just get to get to clean
[2:13:54] your sin out of your life and let God
[2:13:56] fill you with the Holy Ghost and then
[2:13:58] think my goodness sakes I'm just gonna
[2:14:00] I'm just gonna speak and everything's
[2:14:03] gonna go the way I say it that's like
[2:14:08] you know becoming 15 years old and
[2:14:11] thinking well my goodness I of my son of
[2:14:13] my dad and he's gonna give me the keys
[2:14:15] to the car tomorrow cuz that's my 16th
[2:14:18] birthday and I'm gonna drive all over
[2:14:19] this town no no that ain't gonna work
[2:14:23] well he's gonna take you to a big
[2:14:27] parking lot and then he's gonna put it
[2:14:30] in park and get out let you drive a
[2:14:32] little bit in a parking lot where you
[2:14:35] can't hit nothing and then you're gonna
[2:14:38] strive and practice and get better and
[2:14:41] maybe at some point in time he's gonna
[2:14:42] allow you to get onto the interstate and
[2:14:45] that first time you get on the
[2:14:46] interstate man that's gonna be some kind
[2:14:48] of scary you should be like these cars
[2:14:49] are going too fast it's like I thought
[2:14:51] you were just thinking like I'm just
[2:14:52] gonna become this myth this awesome
[2:14:54] driver on day one
[2:14:57] no but you kept pressing you kept
[2:15:00] striving you kept going through the
[2:15:02] fears and through the pains and sort of
[2:15:04] hurts and through but but through all of
[2:15:06] the successes you've grown and you've
[2:15:08] come so far
[2:15:09] keep pressing church don't let the mark
[2:15:12] come down set the mark hi the mark of
[2:15:14] the high calling of God in Christ Jesus
[2:15:16] it's the worst thing you can do in the
[2:15:18] most offensive thing you could really
[2:15:20] kind of do to Christ is to bring that
[2:15:21] mark down keep it high recognize I'm
[2:15:24] striving to serve you god you're awesome
[2:15:28] you're amazing you're worth pressing for
[2:15:31] you're worth giving everything for and
[2:15:35] then God can use you God can fill you
[2:15:38] brother Branham says in the message
[2:15:39] beyond the curtain of time musicians can
[2:15:41] come each one of us play a part in this
[2:15:43] picture and in this song we are parts of
[2:15:46] the kingdom of God and that is that we
[2:15:48] can play our parts
[2:15:49] as long as we realize where we are
[2:15:51] presenting lis belong in this place and
[2:15:55] then stay right there in that place and
[2:15:57] one place we know it's in love because
[2:15:59] that's what makes up the picture I just
[2:16:01] love how this how he lays this quote out
[2:16:03] that it's so artistic and beautiful each
[2:16:06] one of us play a part in the picture and
[2:16:07] in the song you get a choir each one of
[2:16:10] you is playing a part in that song you
[2:16:13] paint a picture each little you know
[2:16:15] maybe make it into a puzzle each little
[2:16:17] piece goes in a specific place and
[2:16:20] that's you you are a specific place and
[2:16:23] God wants to use you and make you the
[2:16:25] best whatever that place is that you
[2:16:28] could ever be and that'll fill you with
[2:16:31] the most value you'll ever have in your
[2:16:32] entire life I guarantee you but you have
[2:16:36] a part God wants to use you maybe you
[2:16:40] think you're insignificant and you think
[2:16:43] well what can I do well start pressing
[2:16:49] and God will show you start asking God
[2:16:53] get down to business with God don't
[2:16:55] don't don't allow yourself to just just
[2:16:57] like well I'm a believer so yeh no I

[2:19:49] [Music]
[2:19:56] can we just look at that scripture that
[2:19:59] brother Trevor gave us there Philippians
[2:20:07] 3:13
[2:20:09] I just really appreciate the way two
[2:20:12] lawyers down to 13
[2:20:17] just to break this down today and I
[2:20:21] couldn't get this out of my mind after
[2:20:24] he
[2:20:26] - radius pondering
[2:20:32] Oh
[2:20:35] how does Paul
[2:20:38] formulate words of this nature and when
[2:20:42] we think about Paul and just about
[2:20:46] every Church throughout the world that
[2:20:48] would this one that's gathered for
[2:20:50] service
[2:20:50] somebody's quoted Paul is quoting from
[2:20:53] Paul Paul said this Paul said that and a
[2:20:57] man that has been used so mightily of
[2:20:59] God that was chosen to write two thirds
[2:21:04] of the New Testament is the first church
[2:21:06] eats messages right words like this
[2:21:09] brother that count not myself to have
[2:21:13] apprehended even though I got 2/3 of New
[2:21:16] Testament I still count not myself
[2:21:19] to have a prohibit but this one thing I
[2:21:22] do in the only way that a man weekend
[2:21:25] really
[2:21:27] set the mark higher we got to kind of
[2:21:30] look at it away Paul with Ben
[2:21:33] forget about the things that you have
[2:21:35] already accomplished
[2:21:38] as if this day's a new day in your life
[2:21:40] - never even heard this before but
[2:21:42] forget it all things which are bad
[2:21:46] got ain't nothing
[2:21:51] reaching forth unto those things which
[2:21:53] are
[2:21:55] if we can do that I can guarantee this
[2:21:57] we will never find ourselves getting
[2:21:59] complete sense
[2:22:01] when it comes to the things of God I
[2:22:03] think that's one of the biggest things
[2:22:05] that we have to battle because Satan
[2:22:07] loves them well you did this you did
[2:22:09] that sometimes we put God on the scale
[2:22:13] [Music]
[2:22:15] you know and I read in the Bible my
[2:22:19] Prima just feels so good so you just put
[2:22:25] something on this side
[2:22:27] and it caused us to come right back down
[2:22:29] again and God's always on this scale
[2:22:31] gonna wanna be a little scale
[2:22:35] he wants you to he wants to be first
[2:22:37] place in your life
[2:22:38] every minute every hour every day
[2:22:43] impressive doors a mark
[2:22:45] I'm pressing towards the mark even as I
[2:22:47] go into this next year I'm pressing
[2:22:49] toward some are not looking at all the
[2:22:51] things that maybe we did in 2019 that's
[2:22:53] like I'm not
[2:22:54] I'm starting all over again
[2:22:56] [Laughter]
[2:22:57] [Music]
[2:23:00] he's worthy of our praise is worthy of
[2:23:03] our life so were there everything we can
[2:23:06] give
[2:23:08] and I just love this statement
[2:23:11] that brother Trevor made and something
[2:23:14] that we should dismantle Tate on
[2:23:16] [Music]
[2:23:18] it's about a dangling carrot in front of
[2:23:20] you but he says
[2:23:22] the closer
[2:23:24] you get to him
