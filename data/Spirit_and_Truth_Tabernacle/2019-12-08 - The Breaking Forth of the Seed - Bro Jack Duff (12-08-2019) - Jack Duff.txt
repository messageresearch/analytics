believe they came and amen to be with us off to dance so good to have you all god bless you dear Steven be guy we certainly thank God for them so I'm just try to go right into her thought for the day a man kind of long day yesterday a man but we thank God for everyone that was able to go with a man being part of services and made it back safely god bless you thank you musicians appreciate you all it meant so much I want to just read to Pastor script if you all just stand with me a man and I will read from two places here in the Word of God the first being Genesis chapter 1 a man Genesis chapter 1 and your brother else was just gonna do a little interpreting for a man our brothers and brother and sister from under her side I didn't want to say this I appreciate last night I got a telephone call they they wanted to come to church so what they did was they drove up here to the church to find out where it was so that they'll know where to go in the morning and and you know I heard from one of the relatives that they've already scoped it out they know exactly where it is so they'll be ready amen in the morning and and and and I appreciate that you know amen though those are people that come that want to get something from God and man and I pray that God will speak to them they may even on today I remember a man a brother share with me a service just recently the there was a brother that came to church he wanted to hear from God so bad but they didn't speak his language and so what God did was he said Lord let me pray the prayer say Lord let me hear the preacher today amen so in song service he heard nothing but when the preacher picked up the mic and started speaking the brother stood through the whole service I heard everything the preacher said everything the preacher said and soon as a preacher said a man okay we're back to Amen I wouldn't say went back to normal because that's not normal right but it went back to the way it was but but he heard everything the preacher said in his language see that's Pentecost that's the original Pentecost man they heard in their own language and and why can't we expect that right he is the same it's not I don't I don't even want to use words if he is the same no he is the same yesterday that damn forever so if he did it then he will do it again today we gotta come on expectation like that hallelujah hey man he's able he's a breeze able so Church I just come under expectation believe in God a man to do these things and so we just if you all here brother Josue a man interpreting that's why he's doing that but if you hear him stop then you already know that something changed hallelujah go already go when the brothers say no I got it I hear everything Amen god is good that's that's we are on the expectation turn with me to Genesis chapter 1 the man just verse 11 is where we will start from praise the Lord just a couple of scriptures here it says this and God said let the earth bring forth grass the herb yielding seed and the fruit tree yielding fruit after his kind whose seed is in itself upon the earth and it was so and the earth brought forth grass and herb yielding seed after his kind and the tree yielding fruit whose seed was in itself after his kind and God saw that it was good and the evening and the morning were the third day a man let's also turn to a passage in Luke chapter 8 I met Luke chapter 8 praise the Lord and I'll just start here verse 5 a man says a sore went out to sow his seed as he sowed some fell by the wayside and it was trodden down the fowls of the air devoured it and some fell upon a rock and as soon as it was sprung up it was the way now it did grow a man indeed grow but and and notice what its prompt the scriptures say as soon as it was sprung up it withered away it's me man a man a man a man because it lacked moisture all right a man and some fell among thorns and the thorns print with that means this also did grow right because thorns sprung up with it amen all right and choked it hallelujah and then verse 8 says an other fell on good ground and if I used a term that the Prophet use pre-prepared ground right others fell on good ground and sprang up and bear fruit a hundredfold and when he had said these things he cried he that hath ears to hear let him hear let's pray dear God we thank you for your word that we have read we trust of God that the Holy Ghost would take control for the things that we would speak even now Lord I know it's not by chance about accident that you Lord prepare certain sermons for certain days you know exactly who would be in the midst and you know who needs what you are a great God a mighty God and also God so father we pray that you would speak from heaven through your word that God it would make the difference in our lives in our hearts today we ask this in the mighty name of the Lord Jesus Christ a man a man a man you can be seated in the presence of the Lord praise the Lord amen we want to take a subject today breaking forth of the seat a man that breaking forth or we could use a term awakening a man of the seat praise God a man just bare with me got a lot of notes and just want to see which way the Lord would just kind of take us today but uh let's uh let's start with a quote here out of the sermon the unchangeable God this is on the back sheet of that paper that I gave you the unchangeable God and he makes us the Prophet makes a statement here says I can go on record for this tonight if any people will take the right mental attitude towards any divine promise that God ever made maybe I forgot to give you that one here's a date 60 - 0 3 - 6 60 - 0 3 - 6 and the paragraph is 8 - 7 amen he says if if any people will take the right mental attitude towards any divine promise that God ever made and claim it for yours I love this a man take the right attitude and then claim it for yours right he says he will God will bring it to pass he says if you'll take the right attitude towards it knowing that if God said so the promise is yours and look at this it's your personal property the promise becomes your personal property God gave it to me right if he didn't give it to anybody else he gave it to me this is my personal property brother when something becomes yours you don't just let anybody just take it come on somebody you'll just let people just do whatever they want to do that that's that's mine that's my car this is my house right hallelujah this is mine and and I don't want you handling what's mine any kind of way glory to God you can handle yours whatever way you want to handle it but if it belongs to me take care of it oh yeah and this is my promise God made it to me and if you don't believe it that's up to you but I'm gonna believe what God gave me praise God I'm not looking at the problem I'm looking at the promise hey glory to God he-man he-man many many men and we got to have the right attitude this is what the Prophet is trying to get to us right so stay with me here as we go a little further a man he says it's your personal property the very minute you receive it that way and that when when you get personal property of a promise of God the Prophet says did it has to come to pass has to come to pass this see gonna break for us at some point in time oh my God my God amen it says for jesus said the word is a seed that are sower sowed and I see if it's a charm Atty see and it goes into the ground then that see under the right conditions I like this the seed gotta be under the right conditions of Sun and moisture you gotta have both now they may not just all moisture you'll drown it but if you get some Sun right there just a mint and both of them working together then that seagull come forth somehow it's gonna come forward you might have to wait a little bit but that seed will come forth watch this then he says the c-4 under the right conditions of the Sun and moisture will bring forth the life that's in the seed and it says and so is the Word of God if a person can take that word and place it in their heart and give it the right sunshine the right temperature not su in but s o is hey man how do you get the s o in the shine of your seeds by reading its words by listening to the tapes right that's how you get the s so in the shine on that seat you must give it moisture and sunshine all right listen he says in the right temperature faith in there that seed and promise will live to you just like it did at the beginning to the one it was given to because it's God's Word and he is the same yesterday today and forever he cannot fail now I could stop right there in that quote and just kind of go forward in our thought for the day but I just felt in my spirit to go a little further in the quote the next portion of this quote actually a man I wouldn't say ties into the thought that I'm trying to bring to you today but nevertheless I think it's something that God wants you to hear all right and it goes on he says now the thing is with the people is the way God appears that's where the problem come it's the way God appears many times we want to make an idol out of God we ask God to do something and then he must do it just the way that we ask it I see that that's that's that that you know we've we talked to you know be specific in the way that we pray and things of that nature but we got it we got it we got to understand that God is still God he does whatever he wants to however he wants to so when you pray you have to bring that leg the Lord this is whatever you want to do I my assets but how do you want to do it i'ma let you do it come on we can't we can't limit him because when we limit him we make an idol out of him I want to release you to do big things a man I want to release you to do great things this is the neat car look father however you gonna meet it that's the way you meet it but this is the neat Oh God glory amen if I need a million that don't matter how God get the million here if I need two million no matter how God get the two million here Amen Lord I just need millions hallelujah all right all right chemic chemical for he says many times we want to make an eye light of God we ask God to do something and then he must do it just the way that we ask it or we'll say he never answered when we do that we weaken our faith in God amen and we weaken our testimony when we do not take him at its word it says God sometimes answers God most of the time answers no no God always answers oh I love that he may not come when you wound him but he's always on time always answers and sometimes you know if the answer may not come in the way that you you know you thought it was coming or when it get that might come in a way that you didn't expect and when I was expecting this but no no everything is working together for good to them that love God to them who are the called according to his purpose right a man so let's not question God let's learn to praise God and just thank God and glorify God and exalt God a man a man a man is more where that came from but you have to give him some praise glory glory glory glory hallelujah says God always answers no one never asked jesus said ask and you shall receive seek and ye shall find every one that asks will receive every one that feasts shall find every one that knocks it will be opened to him that's the only way that I found I've always found it that I can get anything from God has take him at his word and believe it the way he sends it believing the way he says that now if we do not take it just the way that we think it is we've built God as an idol he's got to answer just according to our ways or well it's just no good a man he didn't answers God answers in many ways he answers in peculiar ways times and everything is odd so we don't want to limit God amen when we're expecting God to do something for us now I want to go forward in this thought we're talking about the brick and fourth of the see a man we looked here in Genesis and it was the third day of creation and God is commanding a man here in the scripture he says let the earth bring forth grass the herb yielding seed and the fruit tree yielding fruit after his kind whose seed is in itself upon the earth and it was so we read that in Genesis a warning 11 and and and what we're what we're gaining from here Amen there's a law that God has established in scripture that when it when a seed is planted a man is put in the right conditions that see has a law in it that it must bring forth at this kind must if you put apple seed in the ground you are not to expect oranges if you see oranges you should question something what what happened here right because I know I placed an apple seed in the ground right and an apple seed must it has a law in it that it must produce apples Oh hallelujah amen the thing about the seed is that it has what we call perpetual life in it Oh glory to God amen I'm talking about a natural a man fruits eat has perpetual life in it I was listening to a quote where brother Branham was was even talked about as we're going into this this winter season amen this winter time you know we go through springtime and things are kind of coming forth there they're there they're growing in there everything is like renewed and spring but then and someone begins to kind of die a little bit and fall by the time fall hit it can get them leaves on it and you know it's getting ready to go soon as the leaves change but you know that's the most beautiful time then the flower a man is experiencing it with it when it reaches its fall season some are saying seasons like that hallelujah amen sometimes we like man this is falling off and that's falling off and I'm going through it's enough that's the most beautiful time of your life it's when you're in the fall season and I want you to understand something about this perpetual life that senousy in the fall season before it goes into winter there is a seed inside the plant that drops back into the earth hallelujah and this is why a flower when it dies can I tell you this it's not a different flower coming up it's the same flower coming back up because there was a seed inside the flower that dropped before winter and that she women to the earth and that she had a low inside of it that it had to stop this time so if it went down yellow is coming back up yellow if they went down purple is coming back up purple there's a perpetual light in the seed oh my my my my in the seed I'm telling you that so there's some people that's gone through winter time in their life right now don't you get discouraged because you see winter amen if there's a seed before they went to winter season something drop and whatever drop has got to come back up it may take some time they may have to make it through winter weeping may endure for a night but joy Wainscott shall come in the morning that sea will produce out his own kind yet you may have your winter but you gotta come for if God put a law like that in the natural see what do you think he did with himself come on since I've never lost one all that the father's giving me will come I've never lost one it may look like wintertime hallelujah but there's a seat there and that see must bring forth after sky blessed be the name of the Lord [Applause] whew to plant an apple tree I love the way the Prophet puts it he says every Apple that will ever come from that tree was actually inside the seed if the tree produces 1 million apples in its lifetime the all of that was inside the little seed oh yes I understand the potential that's just in in the seed I'm talking about something so small when you when you look at a big apple tree or whatever type of tree you're like well my this huge tree amen all of that was inside of a seed all that happiness that the see was placed in the right conditions and once this place with the right conditions once it got su in and some moisture it just did what it was supposed to do and when we give the sons of God and the daughters of God in the right condition then they are gonna do what they're supposed to can I tell you something we're not waiting for power to come the powers in the sea we're just trying to get it in the right condition praise God when they were at the upper room they were in the right condition get a little water get a little air so in on this we'll see this thing producing and do the things that God intended for it to do you know what this is to me this is this is deeper than what I can even present deeper than what I can present the gesture the the the how great God is and how you can find them it's something so small a seed and that seed is that's that's a natural type in something spiritual if God put it in a apple tree to produce after sky nor a mango tree to produce after scan or orange tree a grapefruit tree amen the banana tree it's all in is that the seed was in itself it has except this cameras got along if God did all of that for a natural see what's what you're thinking about a predestinated see it's got to produce I've just kind of what is this kind God is it's kind if a banana tree producer produces bananas and an Apple produces apple and an orange produces oldest God will produce God because that's what was in the seed every attribute that was in God it's inside to see all we have to do is put in the right conditions watch it produce because the law is in the seat oh come on church the law is inside the seat hey it's the law that's exactly right it's la lai lai lai lai praise God it's your sin to see this you can see as I wouldn't tell anybody when you get these things you know you you you realize a man that uh that nothing is lacking nothing is lacking not one thing is lacking oh we got only thing if there's anything lacking it's patience all we got to do is wait on God there's something there there's I mean this word seed that we have been given it's gonna produce exactly what God says gonna produce don't matter how long it take it will come forth let me just go on a little further here a man just give you a few a few uh statements here now remember a fruit seed or whatever there's even on a plant the plant carries a seat and and when that plant drops at at winter time that see drops in the ground and and even though it looked like the plant withered away during winter because the seed drop it causes the same flower you get that it's not a different flower it is the same flower and if I can just put it this way instance same flower at a different stage but it's the same flower in the springtime the same flower came back up it was a different flower this is not new growth this is the same thing growing all over again because the see that dropped back inside the earth that seeds what makes it the same flower a it's not a replacement a man it's a resurrection of the same exact flower and they go through season after season after season a mint doing the exact same thing because it has perpetual life in it but we're not talking about just perpetual like we talk about eternal life in the seed of God is eternal all right let's go on a little a little further here so brother Branham teaches us something it says if we plant a seed amen in order for it to grow we must commit it to the earth right because it will never grow if you dig it up and the way you dig up your seats hallelujah is with your doubts glory to God they made brother Branham say committed to God and leave it here the best soul you can never plant a seed in is God's oil do you know it's gonna grow hallelujah but he said committed to God and leave it there don't go out the next day wonder win this thing I'll come up Oh amen don't get don't get discourage because man I ain't seen I planning it not now now here so here so here's the thing that you can have confidence in did you plan it did you do the work to get it in the earth do you know that you planted the seed where to see it itself got a low inside of it it's got to come for all it needs is some sunlight amen it some moisture and it will come first so committed to God you want to know how you water your seat just with your praises [Music] [Applause] Amen when it's gonna seem like let's get a little dry when your life seems like it's getting a little dry I'll forgot some grace that's how you get the moisture around the seeds glory to God he says committed to God and leave it there he says every time you dig it up it delays it another day and not only says every time you look at your symptoms it delays you to delays you too in your healing so I'm not looking at symptoms I'm looking at my seat I know what I planted if I planted it I know what to expect glory to God he says he says Holy Ghost seeds of the Bible cannot grow in the atmosphere of wisdom can I say that again the Prophet says Holy Ghost seeds of the Bible cannot grow in the atmosphere of wisdom that's in a message wisdom versus space just little statement said I'm picking up here and there we were talking about the seeds amen the other thing he says as though the word can't grow in denomination now let me just read this as well this is coming from the message the seed shall not be heir with us with the show Oh glory to God hallelujah hallelujah the man the sea shall not be here with the show the Prophet says this he says but now we're standing at the time of the seat we're standing at the time of the seat now the seat will hold what support cooperate with the seat holding it it was set there for that purpose to hold it because as the Sun comes up in the early spring upon the wheat watch the whole nature through the season roll through the day roll everything rolled just perfectly right with God now when that warm Sun begins to shine upon the seat it brings forth this is why we're preaching the breaking breaking forth of the seat when that warm Sun begins to shine upon the seed it breaks forth but the world has to be in a certain position to make that seed break forth out of the dirt and I love this the world has to be in a certain position to make that seed break forth out of the dirt it has to come around this away and get in a certain position to make that seat come forth it had to come that way to get it out get it out of upon the Dark Age now you know and I'm looking at that from both the natural as well as spiritual we know in order for a seed that come forth from the natural it hasn't been a certain position Amen a certain position also has to have a certain condition with with it has to have certain amount of water a certain amount of moisture so the condition has to be right and the position has to be right hallelujah before that sea would actually break forth before you'll see what you planted it has to be in the right condition and in the right position and spiritually I say there are some seed of God that must break forth hallelujah you just can't keep sitting on God at some point in time if you were son of God and a daughter of God you got to respond to your God you got to respond to your Creator you got to respond to your makeup if a natural see will respond by shooting through the earth little shoots so let it know I'm responding to what God is doing in my situation Amen if you are a son of God I thought oh god you're gonna have to respond at some point in time hey at some point I'm your hand gonna get lifted up sup one time you know say Amen to the Word of God we just gotta get you in the right condition the right situation and you will respond to God we looking for the predestinated seed to have a revival glory to God hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah it has to be in a certain position to make that seed break forth out of the dirt all we doing just trying to put that's why we got prayer meetings going on we're trying to put it in the right condition in the right atmosphere we want to see this thing break forth we're trying to make the seed break for amen amen that this is something I can make great forth because I know what I plan it hallelujah we're trying to make the seat break forth that's what he said the world the world has to be in a certain position like these words the world has to be a certain position you know there are certain things in your life that happen to you that cause you'll see to come forth there are certain things that happen in your life certain trials that you're gonna have to go through in order to put yourself in position for the seed to come forth do you realize the prodigal son had to go through certain things in his life before he can realize who he really was hallelujah until the seed broke forth in his life he couldn't appreciate his position Oh y'all in with me hey man he didn't realize what he had when he was at his daddy's house he even realized the glory he didn't realize the great things that that was before him when he was at his daddy's house he may he didn't realize he was not a servant but he was a son amen and by being a son there were certain things that were gonna come to him when Daddy died there was an inheritance that went to the son the service will never experience since the service may live in the house but they're not the sons they will never experience what the sons have they may have a good life but they won't have the life of the son and that boy could appreciate that he thought he said I'm smarter than daddy i'ma get up and imma leave my daddy's house he says I'm going out on my own I'm gonna make this thing work on my own and as he went out on his own hallelujah everything that he had he lost just like that praise the Lord don't you thank you smarter than mommy and daddy praise the Lord you come out on your own if you want to you got a few dollars in the bank your money be gone before you know it and you ain't gonna have but one place to go you think you got free is now your friends gonna lose it all and they gonna have a place they could go back to but you gonna be stuck on a limb coming back like prodigal son came back hallelujah amen I rather just be a uh-uh-uh amen are serving in your house because the servants live better than the way I'm living out here and it's good that he came back with that type of spirit because the daddy could work with him sudden I see you broken I see you broken but all that's happened is the seed is now breaking for and now let me let me impart let me a part a deeper revelation to you son I got servants all over the place and yes they do live well but they were not born they were not born of my lord so therefore you can never be a servant you will always be a son you had to recognize the status and he took his place but there were things in life that calls him to amen get a better understanding of his position even with some pigs caused him to get a better understanding of his position going through broken relationships caused him to get an understanding of his position oh my god young man young woman don't don't marry nobody that I ain't no believer hey man don't you do that right cuz here you don't you don't realize that you put yourself in a situation that you can't get out of amen you you get married that don't work out did you try to find somebody not that ain't gonna be working out like that no no you better pray and wait on God because I'll tell you what your relationship will reduce the right situation for your seed to grow you weren't thinking about praying before now you're gonna pray remember I remember I'd made this announcement plenty of times say either you gonna pray now or you gonna pray later but what you don't ready you can either pray now you can play later but you don't bring glory to God you guys I'm tired in order for the seed to break forth you got to put it in the right conditions and in this way brother MC says but the world has to be in a certain position to make the sea bring forth the world the things you go through in the world will cause a seed to break for I'm telling you it some of us wouldn't be here right now have we not gone through the things we went through God was using your circumstance to bring you to this place and if he hears that for you let him do the same thing for your loved ones hallelujah just put him in the right situation the right circumstance and watch to see break for I believe this can I go a little further this is our message investments it says I was at an interview with a priest not long ago and he says he said mr. Branum you're trying to talk about a Bible this is the church that God is in his church I said show me where it says the Bible said that God is in the world he is the word and if the word if the words of you it produces caught again that's why I said earlier God is looking for God God nobody planet and what he put in the seat no matter how much dirt is all over it house muddy and look how dirty look how filthy look God know what he put inside that seat and i'ma tell you an order for a seed to grow it's gotta give him some muddy dirty messed up conditions hey ma'am even if you put on gloves your gloves gonna get dirty when you're working with seeds I hope you're with me [Music] it says it'll print it produces God again and he said the word is a seed in the seed produces what its kind is it'll produce a godly life a fully consecrated life to Jesus Christ how we know that because the Bible tells that God is holy if God is holy and his seed is inside of us but that's gonna make you holy all right which are what was it what what is in God of all the potentials everything that's in da is laying inside to believer a man it's in the believer so everything we see in God it ought we ought to see it in a believer amen otherwise we're not seeing it there's something wrong all right let's go on a little further Christianity versus idolatry the Prophet makes a statement oh thank you Lord Jesus since we are made partakers of his holiness we in His image we are living images of a living God then dead to self raised with him now listen listen to this his word made flesh again in us his word made flesh again and I see we know it was made flesh in Jesus the word became flesh and dwelt among us but now the Prophet brings it a still a step further now that same word is being made flesh in us me being made flesh again in us glory to God it says all brother Neville and I believe if the Prophet here he called all your names Oh sister so-and-so oh brother sir pretty pretty money Sam do you get that do you see that his word is being made flesh again amen if the seed and the fruit to cold let's once before you know a mango see will take on flesh and if it get too close to my house we will take the Amen take the flesh off the seed but if the scene want to be made flesh again it must be planted again and there's a life inside that seed it will come forth again the word will be made flex I give enough the word that the living word will be made flesh we're rittany pistols red ball men this is the Bible Church listen it goes on it says our brother never look what is it not the mythical imaginary God setting out there but the Living God says what is the Living God the word and you making itself real simple but deep but what is what is the Living God the word in you making itself real right now this is why I said earlier we're not waiting on nothing to come it's here and God just need to make this real to us Lord sometimes when I pray say Lord just just help my help me get revelation and understanding as to who I am now who I'm gonna be but Who I am God you put this in me before I was even born now now help me water this and and get the right amount of SOA and light on it so I can see this but these quotes that we give it this is SOA light Oh hallelujah amen when you listen to the Prophet you get there so in light hallelujah and as you get into conditions like that II can't help but break forth seed will break forth no matter what the conditions are look at this he says this says the wording you make himself real whoa glory to God he says oh I know you think I'm a holy ruler maybe I am but oh brother do you see it triumphs over every denomination triumph over all paganism a living God made manifest in a living temple and the Word of God which is God is made flesh in you why you're seated in heavenly places triumphs over all things in Christ Jesus amen oh I just love it I have to skip something and go on I just I thank God for that that the Living God is the word in you making itself real the word that's already in you is making itself real I heard the preacher say yesterday say sometimes I go around now talk to myself and people think that I might have lost my mind because I'm talking to myself he said but I'm really not just talking to myself I'm talking to what's living on the inside of me I'm talking to the God that's living on the inside of me hallelujah Church and sometimes when you when you hear quotes like that you just have to stop and think because we you know this earth got us program in a certain way but this word is trying to pull out trying to put us in the right condition where it can pull out the the things that got put in us what's the potential that's inside the seat God trying to bring that out and we got it we got the feet on the word we got a you know we got we got we got the guess so in light on we got to get more so we got to get all that because I'm I'm trying to be all that God wanted me to be a man you try to be like God yes I can't help that because that was inside the seat that's just that's just part of the DNA of God to be like God hey man all right let me go on a little further this is a message the rapture it says when I went forth into the meetings with you praying for the sick it was fine says but when I come with a message if any message goes forth it's a true message and if it's the true genuine miracles of God and hangs right in that organization you know it's not of God CSC can grow in denomination glory to God Hanks right in the organization you know it's not of God cuz that thing is already declared he says Jesus went forth and heal the sick in order to catch their eyes of people them his message glory hallelujah then it's message that's right it has to have something that God is going to introduce deep dive divinely healing his miracles like that just catch the eyes of the people so when I listen to the tapes and I hear you know brother Branham coming out different people's situations and tell them who they're addressing and telling their conditions and then pronouncing that they're healed and he go from one city to the next city ain't no way he had time to meet all their people and didn't remember all their conditions how this was more than a man this was God using a man hallelujah only God could show those things go into different countries never step put alone grounds before and say these things it was God using that man but God did that to get our attention the miracles and all of those things was Jessica nigh attention we had to come out of that in order to be in position for the sea to grow I couldn't stand the denominational Church and get this I couldn't stay hey what were they gonna preach to me I heard it so many times dang in the lion's den the day the Hebrew boys I heard it so many times oh my God my God my God Church I tell you what I thought I thank God that this word and thank God the miracles grab my attention to bring me forth to the word and by sitting underneath the atmosphere of the s om now this thing can grow now it can grow I'm in the right place now for something to take place hallelujah Oh glory let me just keep reading I got so I got I got it got a few more things I just need to share with you there's gonna be a multi-part sermon I'm sure but but but you know just bless my heart when I watch what the prophets say here he says it has to have something that God is going to introduce divine healing his miracles like that just catch the eyes of the people but the main heart of it is the message so the heart of the divine healing the heart of every miracle was the message we don't want to miss a message part we thank God for all the miracles but don't miss the message don't miss the fact that God sent you a prophet man that thing hit me like a ton of bricks just recently you know you know if somebody else might say well I just don't see that in Scripture brother Jack I don't see where God sent a prophet and there's many say that God didn't even need to send a prophet what you know I'm gonna tell you something that God did God love you so much that when he put the promise in the scripture he didn't exclude you because what God was really trying to say well I'm just y'all just bear with me on this one it's just my revelation what God was really trying to say behold I send Jack Duff Elijah that's what he was a butthole I sent jacked-up now now see people to put my name there y'all were to know exactly who he was talking to but because he loved you so much he didn't put my name there he put everybody name there by saying behold I've seen you Elijah the Prophet before the coming of the trip for day of the Lord thank God for the miracles but don't miss that message yeah okay uh Moses had all kind of miracles I mean flies and and and and and lice and you know the water turned into blood and you know I mean you just name it ten planes struck each other but you know the message came out of Moses really say you better ply the blood to your door so you could be rejoicing over the lice and you can reuse your soul or the Flies and you can rejoicing over the water amen turn the blood but if you did not apply the message you would have been stuck in Egypt hummina glory to God so you want to hear the message of that prophet and you want to apply that for this thing we're not living in Moses day no more we've got to see the scripture as it's fulfilled today Malachi 4 revelation 10 7 6:17 these are scriptures that I for today we got to see how it's working today Oh blessed be the name of the Lord the main the heart of it is the message there's what it is what comes from in here he's trying to get the favor of the people so they'll said and listen to him see for there's something in there that's ordained to life he goes on in this quote assess some of the grain we fell on the ground and I love this statement the birds picked it up others fell among storms and some went unprepared ground or pre-prepared ground and brought forth this is what I use that earlier it went on pre-prepared ground and brought forth now let's go back and look at that scriptwriter Luke 8 it went on pre-prepared ground and brought forth what what I went up what I want you to understand about pre-prepared ground before you work before you were even born you came to this earth with something on the inside of you ready to receive this you had never even heard of no message before you never heard no message what you're talking about I listen to the other day somebody come up to the the window out there brother Geoffrey happen to be there and like what kind of church this is brother said Christian Church anyway everybody said he Christians now we could have just blew the man away in one word have you ever heard of the message he probably would have been like you asked what kind of church it was message what that what does that say that's what that's why we said Christian right that's that's why we said Christian and let me tell you something everyone might might say they're Christians but they're not Christians follow Christ amen hallelujah it'd take a lot more than just coming to all ten and and making a confession after you make a confession you got to live like Jesus hallelujah somebody make confessions every week and don't mean them any man you got to follow you have to follow in the steps of Christ if you're gonna be a Christian live like them live according to his word a man in the commands from the chemical commandments of God are not Grievous amen Christians not looking for no easy way out but you know I mean but but it's Taylor do you know there's a message that has come forth in this hour God sent a prophet to bring us a message to give us prepare for a rapture did the church were now so confused by rap today some of them don't even believe in it no more they don't even believe in it because they couldn't explain it the Word of God is not man you can't explain it you got to believe it by faith there's some things you just discipline your mind you talk about God God has too much greater his thoughts are great enough thoughts his ways are great higher than our ways we can't we can't do nothing about that just accept it by faith all right I'm looking at this because it has to be pre-prepared ground and I believe before you were born you were God I'd already prepared your ground to receive a man this word in this day I heard a brother stayed what what are they what a day to live in brother John Kalinga made a statement yesterday he said you know we live in a time where we're time blends into eternity we're the people that's living in this in the most the greatest age because this is the age where people will catch a rapture right one day they maybe might call it looking for you how come you can come to work rapture rapture all right I mean but we're living that time we can expect this church we can expect the change of the body we can expect Christ to come back at any time we're living in the and the greatest time that anybody could ever live is at the second coming of the Lord Jesus this is a very special hour don't let the devil get your so wrapped up and and messed up in all the things of the world a man keep your mind on Jesus this is a very important hour that we live let's look at this scripture because we talked about pre-prepared ground that the breaking forth of the sea pre-prepared ground now we're at this let's go back and look at Luke 8 again hallelujah verse 5 it says a soul went out to sow his seed and as he sold some fell by the way so seed is falling all over the place some fell by the work by the wayside and it was trotting bound and the fowls of the air devoured it now you know I'm a just i'ma say this not adding to the word but you know a seat even if the fowls of the air guy it can still grow because it goes through their system and they let the seed right back out into the earth again Oh y'all a wit me some y'all don't went through some stuff pray are you with me now do you know whither some stuff but the devil cannot stop that seed from coming forth let's say what happened to a see when you bury it it grows Jesus look at this now thus a soul went forth the sword seed and as he sowed some fell by the wayside and it was trotting down and the fowls of the air devoured it but the same found sister found they will have to let it go again like watch this it's saying some fell upon a rock and as soon as it was sprung up it withered away because it lacked moisture and some fell among thorns and the thorns sprang up with it and choked it my god watch you know you want to make sure you got pre-prepared ground here since another fell on good ground and sprung up and bear fruit a hundredfold and when he had said these things he cried he that happen yeah let he neither have ears to hear let him hear and his disciples asked him saying what might this parable be not a good thing about this is that they had private audience with Jesus other people left that service with no understanding as to what Jesus just saying but because they had private audience with Christ they could get clarity look at this oh my god I feel like because we got this message we got private audience hey man that's why we get clarity on these things any scripture in the Bible this is a church that we can preach in the book of Revelation their church that they will not touch revelation will not touch it because it just we don't know what it means they don't went to school and still don't know what it means God sent us a prophet that's not we know these things first Tim says and he said unto you it is given to know the mysteries unto you Lori to know the mysteries of the kingdom of God but to others in parables thank God we know the mysteries that seeing they might not see and hearing they might not understand now the parable is this the seed is the word of God in men and if it's the Word of God is God a man because the Word was made flesh and dwelt among us the sea is God but sea is the word of God hallelujah since those Bible ways are they they're here then cometh the devil hallelujah and taketh away the word out of their hearts lest they should believe and be saved now I'm telling you even after the day that everyone comfort you on your promise but you got to hold on to what God gave you it has to become personal property personal property listen it says so it says the devil and taketh away the word out of their hearts lest they should believe and be sane so that's the ones that a man when it's falling on the wayside now verse 13 they own the rock they which when they hear receive the word with joy and these have no root but I don't want to just be here shouting and jumping over the word but not letting us take root in my life amen you know we we learn Church behavior we know how to rejoice from everybody else ready to us if the preacher lifts its voice a little bit we know to say Amen I I'm not saying man because a preacher lifts his voice I say man because he preaching the word brother that's what my soul needs glory to God listen says they are maracas they which when they hear receive the word glory glory glory glory glory glory I just that just blessed my heart that brother said a man like that that blessed my heart he catching it secondhand but that's how that's how powerful this word is oh not even even if you have to catch a second hand it still has power Jesus glory to God hallelujah look at look at this he says it says they on the rock Ave which when they hear receive the word with joy and these have no root which for a while believe so that means for a while it's growing and for a while they believed for a while get that church don't don't don't let Jesus work over you people can go on for a while for a certain amount of time and then they stopped believing what happened they meant for a while believe it look at look what he said and in the time of temptation fall away what my prince lord help me I don't want to be like that God why let this fall into my heart and or if you know coming to my presence and then I can't hold on to it I don't want it to be like that oh my you know I mean it's like like like jewels or something precious jewels that somebody would give you and and already I thought you know he already do just kind of just show it to you why well just show it to me i won't i won't access a man for me to look at it it's not gonna do much for me any man but if you get it to me it will change my life hallelujah look at this now verse 14 and that which fell among thorns are they which when they have heard go forth and our choked with care and riches and pleasures of this life and bring no fruit to perfection that's it that's so we got to watch this now you can get seat you can hear the word of God but the cares of this life will cause you to miss what God is trying to call you to you so concerned about your career you know God didn't put you here only for a career what if God disrupt your career like he did mine what do you do then went to school got my master's degree I'm ready to work since I got my masters got promoted here I've become the manager and man everything and I'm gonna tell you something I a lord help us God when you become manager when you become manager and you lose your job it's hard to go back and not be managed again now you limit what jobs you can get praise the Lord you're limited at what concern I well I was managing I think unless you really get desperate you go back hallelujah but oftentimes when God elevate us all help us hear Holy Ghost when we get elevated it's hard to go back sometimes God wants you to go back because there's some lessons that you learn when you go back but because prior give us a knocking you know that's above me I mean I below me that's below me I I can't do that now God trying to humble that not trying to take that out of you hallelujah you just think be grateful it gave you a job now Amen hallelujah people get jobs 9 days my daughter's tell them somebody comes in you know what could this happening could that happen no that's that's that's not going to happen because we hired you for this did you read the Job Description her reporting to you is not in the job description actually you report to me no management responsibilities here none you want a job Amen that's the way it's gotta be but see God try to Humble us down but sometimes God bless us and we get that blessing man we get a little bit too too heady highminded big-headed praise the Lord it's hard to get humble again amen it's the truth anyhow wash me not me oh oh oh you forgot what you came from all right a man search you don't forgot where you came from huh yeah you can you can have that job yes you can God need you in that environment let me try to get back on the subject here all right verse 14 and that which fell among thorns are they which when they have heard go forth in our choked with cares and riches and pleasures of this life and bring no fruit to perfection look at this talk about that pre pre prepared ground verse 15 but that on the good ground are they which in an honest and good heart having heard the word that it says key after you hear it keep it you know when you plant anything in the earth it don't grow overnight yeah it takes it it takes time for that thing to grow but you got to keep it you got committed right so is it with the promises of God when God gives you a word see promise you got to keep it commit it and watch it grow listen he says but that on the good ground are they which in an honest and good heart having heard the word keep it and bring forth fruit with patience so don't dig up your promise God give you something you hold on to it keep it and it'll bring forth fruit in patience all that has to do is just get in the right condition the right situation and you'll see it come forth let me just give you a couple more things here yeah when I go to looking at things like this I like to go back to like children's websites where they talk about C's I see if they could they could teach it to a child and they can teach it to me and in this child's website that I was looking at a man a cool kid facts it was talking about C's and it says inside a seat is an embryo which is a tiny plant and now now I didn't really realize that was in a seat but on the website they sure you had a big inside the seat and there's actually a plant in the sea callin embryo it's already there in the sea it's got life in it right it says inside a seed is an embryo which is a tiny plant and it says and the endosperm which are small leaves which feed the embryo so the leaves are feeding the embryo causing it to grow the outside of the seed has a coat and this acts as a protection for the embryo to make sure it's safe hallelujah amen God has been protecting you and keeping you but on the inside you you know I remember brother saying you're not you're not the believer but it's the word seed on the inside of you that to believe them listen he said say that embryo is it's simply stored inside the coat and notice what it says waiting for the perfect time to begin germinating so the embryo is safely inside the coat waiting so even when you're looking at a seat there's something in the seed you get that Amen there there's life inside what you can't see all you see is the coating of the outsides hallelujah but what's on the inside a man has to be they use it to germinate it and what that means is that it means it starts growing so when it's germinating is starting to grow now you know where there's germinating inside the coating you can't see it you can't see it growing you don't even realize this girl I can't I tell y'all something even right here right now it may look like folk ain't responding and ain't listening but there is something called on the inside hallelujah and one of these days we gonna see it spread out it might start with Jess that's not just and before you know it it'll keep growing and it'd be hey man when I was blessed well yesterday yesterday when I was at the service I was on Friday night Friday night I was at a service and brother got to preaching and glory to God and and I saw sister come from the back of the church a sister come from the back she walked up to the front that changed where that preacher was preaching when he saw sister come do something like that oh my god my god we need some more that's that's what I'm talking about break foot and when it's when it's true revival it ain't man just when the meeting times every time we come together and we have the fon strikin it'll be a man every time glory to God Church I'm on the expectation so listen so even you're looking at the seed inside the seat is the embryo all right which is a tiny plant now and so so what was inside is actually what's get ready to be manifested on the outside glory to God listen say the embryo is safely stored inside the coat waited for the perfect time to begin germinating which means that it starts growing the sea I need the right conditions to terminate hallelujah to start doing they need the right conditions of to terminate and they may have to wait for years before the conditions are right I love that see in the right conditions will produce exactly what God put in it to produce but sometimes that seed might have to wait for years before it actually begins to grow don't give up on it I put something and see if you don't want it when it's like that sometimes we think the seed is dead no it's not dead it's just it just needs the right conditions right amount of water right amount of moisture I mean right right around mount of sunlight and then also the the world has to be in a certain position for that seed to grow all right let's go on go on a little further look at this look at this look at this some seeds need light to germinate others need darkness are y'all with me some seeds need light to germinate others need darkness I'm gonna just stop there got mo to read on that but I see some seeds will grow in light conditions that mean they come to church they hear the word of God they get into an atmosphere the Holy Ghost is moving in some spark and they've gone others need darkness you can grow in darkness you might be in a bus on a bus tube somewhere in darkness y'all and with me and you you should not think you having the time of your life and then somebody start talking about God remember them brothers there was talk about Christians at a ball and they say ain't no such thing is no Christian and it's that they didn't realize they challenged to truck me they challenged the truck easy truckers all of us said look man I gotta tell you there is a Christian there's at least one come on ain't no such thing as Chris they thought they could drink their problems away they thought that this everybody else had failed him there was no living Christians they could just forget about it but the man say oh yeah there's at least one ain't no Christian it's one well who you talk about my wife your wife a creep let's go to my house the man took them from a dark condition sometimes Oh and order for them to even go to the man's house something had to strike to see some seeds can grow in dark conditions you don't know you know I mean because but see the seed has a low inside that has got to come forward so whether it's in darkness or light is still coming for that that man took them took them fellas back to his house his wife just demonstrated the Christian characteristics and you know I'll say it since some might not know but you know he he said we're gonna act like we've drunk fellas and we're gonna do this we're gonna do that we're just gonna like we dropped we don't put it to a test he's bald and say we want this foot for breakfast he knew what was in the fridge I said we want this for breakfast so so make this for us and we'll even you know that'll be that she went in the kitchen made up all the food brought it to the table and they said I watched this boys watch this he took the plate pushed it after tables so you know I don't like my eggs like this so let's get out of here boys and he knew that would make his wife upset now he said watch this boys they left the house walked outside just listening underneath the window and they heard the wife and this humming must Jesus bear the cross alone and all the world go free no there's a cross for everyone and there's a cross for me so rather than complaining this lady was giving God glory in the midst of her trial and and and in the drunks hurt her do that and they looked at de france' she'll Christian and the lady lair her husband and them other drunks to Christ light struck in the midst of darkness some seeds can grow in darkness now I want to tell you something else now there's some other seeds that can grow some some some very wicked seeds that can grow in darkness see when you go on the websites that you shouldn't be going to seeds will grow in darkness when you're looking at stuff that you shouldn't be looking at seeds were growing darkness you got to be careful what you do when ain't nobody else around hallelujah amen it's it's people that just keep keep going back to them them them websites that that's preaching again and speaking against the message and I'm just gonna do this now no you better stay away from those dark sites you better stay away from it before you know there's a spirit that'll get on you and you don't you don't even know where it came from amen seeds grow in darkness and let me tell you something when it grows wants them towards everybody know what happened let me tell you something did they say they say seized meat some seasoning light to germinate that means to grow others need artists but all seas need moisture oxygen and the right temperature to to germinate now I like this right here another statement that they made on this website the seed needs to pass through the process call scarification in order for the seed to germinate the seeds has to go through a process called scarification Wow big word but this means that the hard Seco changes to allow moisture to get in here you ever seen folk be so hard that they just say gonna let God get nowhere near them but God gonna take you through a process called Scarah fication [Applause] and when you go on through Scarah fication see this is this is this is putting you in a position for something for for the seed to break forth right when you've gone through scare but the prodigal son went through Scarah fication that's what calls him to go back home right but all in the midst of that what was happens that that shell that out of the shell because someone's so tough so tough we think we tough but God got away breaking down that toughness Gaga - we're breaking down that spirit stop fussing and fighting and argue with folk y'all let God do what God do you said you get rid of your show and get broke if God got to scare you out yourself it's gonna get brutal Scarah fication oh god I've seen out I tried to be a tough guy myself one time and you know and God had a way he just I just went to church I went I guess I went one too many times because I went to church that one day I can't even remember what the prep the pastor preached but all I remember sitting back there and being broken in the spirit God had me in tears inside the sanctuary and and the good things I mean sister wesco knew that I was delivered she come just with that big grin on her face and just started smiling and shaking my hand she knew that I had free that day I didn't even have to tell her I went free God had to take me through scary broke me down and if I said like this if God can do it for tough Duff God can do it for anybody and all I'm gonna do just sit back and watch God go take you through Scarah fication Scarah fication happens naturally and nature in a number ways for example freezing temperatures we need win a time in our life to bring us through Scarah fication also and look at this when a seat pass through the digestive tract of an animal see see why I said that bird could actually get the seat and drop it right back into the earth and it still grown because the seat has a pass through the digestive tract of the animal and you know when it's going through the digestive tract of the animal Scarah fication is happening or through microbial activities that break down the seat coat once the conditions are right the plant inside starts to grow and get bigger it pushes open the seat coat a bit like a chick a chick hatching out of an egg tiny leaves appear and they push out of the soil when I'm looking at them thyme leaves I'm just seeing a hand get up like this I'm seeing mouths open up and praise God a man glory to God I'm saying people not ashamed of praising a God because they've been too good for you too good to you right I just that's what I'm looking for I'm under expectation God give me to take somebody threw some scare for cash [Applause] we're looking for the breaking forth of the sea I have more but I want to stop right there for today and amen I trust that the Lord will just kind of carry us forward amen in this thought God is good the Seas will break forth they will break forth and they will produce exactly what God has put in them to produce amen let's pray father we thank you for your word thank you for
