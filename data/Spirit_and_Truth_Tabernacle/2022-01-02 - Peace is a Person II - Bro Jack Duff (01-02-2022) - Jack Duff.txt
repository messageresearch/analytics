on our way driving here about cain how he tried to get ahead of god you know the bible says that he offered abra offered unto god a more excellent sacrifice than cain which means cain's sacrifice was excellent it was just out of season remember jesus was the first fruits of the resurrection so he was trying to get a resurrection without a death amen he also named his first son enoch he also was trying to get a rapture without a death praise lord so we want to wait on god we don't want to get ahead like cain praise the lord um actually uh i didn't have a psalm to read this morning i was actually praying to the lord this earlier this week about some things and i really wanted to know about why we are not me and my family haven't moved here yet so i was praying about some things and my wife she she woke up early that morning and she saw something that she posted years ago on facebook and it's a it's a quote and i want to read to you what it was and it sort of sort of answered my prayer instead of reading this psalm this morning the prophet says one night as i was seeking the lord the holy spirit told me to pick up my pen and write as i grasp the pen to write his spirit gave me a message for the church i want to bring it to i want to bring it to you it has to do with the word and the bride those in the bride do only his will no one can make them do otherwise they have thus saith the lord or they keep still they know that it has to be god in them doing the works fulfilling his own word he did not complete all of his work while in his earthly ministry so now he works in and through the bride and that was the key for me she knows that for it was not yet time for him to do certain things that he must now do but he will now fulfill but he will now fulfill through the bride that work which he left for this specific time and right there is where i found my answer i believe we all can find our answer there for this is our purpose which makes it our protection praise lord let's buy our hearts almighty god father god you speak to us in so many different ways lord but we can find lord pinned in the pages of the bible lord we can hear lord from the message of the hour lord god what you have spoken to us in this day father we have so many desires lord but our main desires to fulfill your will we're here to perform the work that you left for us to do lord so

made a way for us to be standing here in this place today heard brother solomon just talking about the um church there in south carolina it's not able to have service because of covert and there's so many others that are out there amen uh today not able to meet the way that we're meeting um and we just thank god that he's protected us he's kept us and continues to do that and god has made a way and then over and over and over again he's made a way praise the lord i see y'all fanning and and i um we did reach out to the um uh the team here the janitorial team they told us that the ac is actually broken and that's why we don't have ac this morning and i was just thinking to myself you know if we had our own building and the ac was broken you know we do we keep worshiping and keep worshiping and if you think this hot you really don't want to go amen to the alternative when you leave here so let's get the word in our hearts and amen let's live this let it transform us and make us who we need to be in christ amen i won't uh have you stand too long we'll go right into reading scripture thank you musicians appreciate you uh i'll let you sit and be uh comfortable in a second brother mike and sister kenya so good to see y'all god bless you amen good to have you uh with us amen visiting from south carolina uh we those that we did not get an opportunity to do we want to wish you a happy new year we celebrated it by going there to be in service with brother westco and we had a wonderful time there you know at the service and i was just kind of flying back in on new year's eve i was up in north carolina they had went to youth retreat this year that i was supposed to be ministering at and they had to cancel it because of you know just not wanting to have an outbreak a man of covet amongst the saints so they did a like a virtual stream of the service uh there in north carolina and had me and brother stephen coffey and brother burley williams we were the guest speakers and you know they just kind of went to the church and let a few people in and just streamed it and and uh just really really blessed uh i've been hearing uh we were in prayer on tuesday night the brothers were in and brother simba began to pray and in his prayer he start talking about we our purpose is our protection and then i heard brother solomon say it this morning her brother troy said on wednesday night which i was blessed by brother troy's sermon on wednesday night and uh just you know just different ones that i'm hearing that purpose into protection so that was the thought that i used um just kind of talking a little with my wife and she was just encouraging me so that was the thought we used on wednesday night while we're there your purpose is your protection we had a wonderful time and and then i had to kind of form a quick um presentation something i've never taught here i've only talked about it to different ones individually and i finally put a presentation with it and i called it the four tires of marital relations and so i was up to about two something in the morning trying to get it all together and and the lord used it for his glory uh there while we were uh in north carolina so at some point in time i'll bring that amen to the church the four tires of marital uh relations amen all right um so let's just turn our bibles here to john 14 and i don't think i'm going to be able to keep on my jacket today because amen john 14 and and i'm gonna start reading it verse um 23. amen uh let's see here okay john 14 verse 23 it says jesus answered and said unto him if a man loved me he will keep my words and my father will love him and we will come unto him and make our boat with him he that loveth me not keepeth not my sayings and the word which ye hear is not mine but the father fathers which sent me these things have i spoken unto you being yet present with you but the comforter which is the holy ghost whom the father will send in my name he shall teach you all things and bring all things to your remembrance whatsoever whatsoever i have said unto you peace i leave with you my peace i give unto you not as the world giveth i give i am to you let not your heart be troubled neither let it be afraid amen the lord had a blessing to reading this word let's just have a quick word of prayer father we certainly appreciate the ability to read the scripture but we know it takes the holy spirit to help us understand what it is that we have read and god not only what we've read but how we apply it even to life today so god we ask that you at this minister to our hearts thank you for um the opportunity to gather and might not be the the uh the conditions that we're most uh accustomed to but we know there's saints all over this world that's gathering in much worse conditions and they're not complaining they're actually so happy to be amen uh present and in your presence god help us to have an attitude of gratitude and uh god forget about all these other things and lord let us hear the word and not let the enemy distract us amen this morning but help us to hear the word and what you want us to hear today and thank you for the school that has opened their doors to allow us to come in and to fellowship uh uh here god we're grateful for it so bless those that are working on the problem and on the issue god uh bless them and and we certainly god i want to be a help to them not a hurt to them so help us god just to endure amen this time and use uh use it for your glory for your honors in jesus name we pray amen you can be seated amen in the presence of the lord we certainly also want to thank the lord for watching over all of the saints that had been traveling over this past week not just myself i know that uh assistant tina a man went up to south carolina there and and and the silvers uh i don't know where they went they just they just all over the place but uh we thank god for just watching over them and i know that sister michelle uh also is uh her and sister charissa in texas and brother clinton they text me on yesterday let me know that they were in texas uh so just all the saints that are traveling right now we really thank god for that and just pray that god will just give them uh traveling mercies amen um we want to continue our uh thought if peace is a person amen peace is a person i made mention of um of this on last week and i just want to kind of open up by reading a little quote from uh the message uh let's see here possessing all things amen i made mention this last week but we we we're we wanted to just prove that peace itself was a person uh we we have received uh here you know we just kind of i guess we just finished the christmas season i think we did uh but but uh in um you know just in the scripture we were uh told that isaiah said that he would be called wonderful counselor mighty god everlasting father said the government would be upon his shoulders and you know he would be the prince of peace uh so just just by reading scripture we can clearly see that jesus himself is peace and without jesus uh there is no peace there is no peace after i finished the sermon last week brother solomon sought me out and was just kind of sharing a testimony with me there was a brother he was telling me that was a a a a minister and he was young and young in the ministry and and uh you know he just had a real zeal about just preaching the gospel so he did something i think he was in a mall or something like that and somehow he got the uh security guards all wrapped up in something and uh and as they got wrapped up he locked the doors went to the intercom and just start preaching the gospel uh to all the people inside you know the mall and and as as he was preaching you know some was enjoying it some are like why is this guy doing this to us and you know it was just you know someone's just totally offended that this man would take an opportunity like that so finally when they got the doors open and got back in there they got him and arrested him and uh took him on the to the uh uh you know to jail and everything and so his his day had come up uh where he was supposed to go before the judge and the and the judge was you know kind of saying hey we got you on this charge of disturbing the peace you say what you got to say you know on this we got you on this charge you you disturb the peace and and um thank you um you know and and as um you know as they got him on the charge you know the man could only come back to a scripture that the lord had given him and uh he he cried out according to my bible there is no peace saith the lord unto the wicked. and uh it went when he when he said there is no peace saith the lord unto the wicked the judge said case dismissed because that's exactly the truth amen you couldn't disturb the peace amen if they don't have peace hallelujah if you're wicked you don't have peace you'll never have peace if you're a wicked person amen uh you know and what we find out if you're addicted to evil right you'll never have peace until you come in contact with the lord jesus christ that's the only way that you can have peace hallelujah hallelujah so here you know we we um just establishing a man out of this quote here uh peace is a person possessing all things the prophet says this we find in this great story that abraham on the road back coming uh back after the victory was over amen uh he met the possessor of heavens and earth melchizedek which is the king of jerusalem king of salem which was jerusalem which is king of peace so melchizedek a man the the individual is the king of peace and jesus also is the prince of peace right so so we know peace is a person amen he says which is the king of peace which is a king of righteousness he had no father he had no mother he never did begin he never will end so that was nothing else but the almighty and he met him on the road home from the slaughter of the king he met the possessor the one who owned all things met him on the road back what a glorious thing says now abraham i like this abraham was heir to all by the promise so he can lay claim on everything that was in the land and the land itself can i say that again amen abraham glory to god was heir to all hallelujah by the promise amen and he could lay claim oh my god he can lay claim to everything that was in the land hallelujah church amen and and this is what we got to realize as abraham's seat we also are heir to everything god promised amen no matter what it is that we go through no matter how long it takes amen that ain't got nothing to do with the promise of god being made manifest if abraham had to wait 25 years on a promise amen we may have to wait a few years for something to take place but hold to your confession hallelujah amen according to the scripture abraham's faith got stronger as the days got went by he did not get weak in faith but he got stronger in faith kept confessing that promise and we're going to keep confessing the same thing hallelujah to the lamb of god amen and i confess that last year amen and and i'm confessing again this year i believe this year going to be the year that god gonna plant me in the land god gonna plant the church in the land i'm claiming this year you know because one of these days i'ma walk out and step right into my promise hallelujah to the lamb of god amen you got to start claiming your promises don't let the devil just push anything on you just stay with what god promised you it's not up to you to bring it to pass it's up to god to bring it to pass hallelujah i'm only going to say what he said he's a god that supplies all my needs amen is this a need well it's going to be supplied amen if you're you need healing nearby that's the need it's going to be supply you need a job that's the need it's going to be supplied hallelujah glory to god amen we need a church it's gonna be supplied it's gonna be supplied glory hallelujah we possess all things amen amen all right he says this says abraham was heir to all by the promise so he could lay claim to everything that was in the land and the land itself i'm laying claims on the land amen this is my land amen it's my land you know you know god god also had to move some people out the children of israel's promised land you know that right god had to move people out in order for them to possess it now they had to wait for god to move them out praise the lord and now i'm not coveting and the children of israel wasn't covered it was just a promise hallelujah man i i i'm too good god almighty lord help me to stay on track here you go look at a globe map or something like that of the world and uh i you know i'm just kind of looking at it uh uh i got a little globe there in my office at home and as i was looking at it i say well uh where where is jerusalem and and i'm just looking and you know i could i could you know you you have to look for africa you can find that then you get up towards egypt and the top of africa and you say now okay i know they had to cross this red sea where's jerusalem when i looked on that great map of the world you could barely see jerusalem barely see it you know and i thought to myself i say now god was so concerned about his people having this property and here you know i mean the rest of all this great earth that that that they could have had but gobbles i want them to have this little piece right here and it's so small that on the map you can barely see it but god was so concerned about them having that spot right there right amen and when i think about the the little church amen it's a little speck on the map but god is still so concerned about us having that spot right there hallelujah i'm laying claims on the land church all right all right all right hey hallelujah hallelujah amen i'm a shout in the land i'm a dance in the land i'm a preacher in the land hallelujah glory so he can lay claim to everything that was in the land and the land itself abraham had been given the promise now we understand that abraham was the poorest man in all the country because he lived out in the desert and lived in peace with god now see that's that's that now you can be poor and rich at the same time hallelujah because he's rich he's got peace with god hallelujah amen he was a poorest of the lamb because he lived in the desert but he had but but uh lived in peace with god and lot rich lived in the city become the governor of the city he sat in the gate he was a judge and judged the city and he had all the riches and things but abraham was in the desert perhaps the poorest man in the land and yet a claim to possess all amen that's what i like sound like it just kicked in i felt like it just kicked in it says oh tonight we may not be rich in the world's goods but we possess all things amen the church itself possesses some things most things but i know it possesses all things i i'm a brother brother uh uh uh uh josue sent a quote to the brothers earliest this week about this and and and um didn't know this was already in my notes from last week i just didn't get to it but we possess all things amen i say we possess all things whether you feel like it or not you still possess it amen your bank account might not say it but you still possess it we possess all things yet poor yet rich and possess all things i like that we are the old song we used to sing years ago my father's rich with houses and lands he holds the wealth of the world in his hands rupees and diamonds and silver and gold his coffins are full he has riches untold and we are possessive of it because we are a child of the king amen the child always falls air we know all right church let's start talking like that talk like you're a possessor amen act like it's already yours amen worship like it's already yours you you'll walk right into it you'll walk right into the manifestation see that the scriptures say we have to believe now right we pray we believe now and then we receive you don't believe after you receive you believe before you receive right and then you have to start acting like you believe that hallelujah amen all right oh my all right let me just let me uh move on here so you know when we talk about we we know that here uh melchizedek was the king of peace king of salem king of peace this was an individual that represented peace uh we also pick up in scripture where you know that the son that was born that was given was the prince of peace and we just established between these two scriptures that peace is a person and if you do not know the person of the lord jesus you can never have peace not not only not have peace in this life you can have peace when you leave this life right i mean peace peace you have to meet christ in order to have peace now um you know the other thing that i wanted to just kind of uh bring out here if i could uh let me see here amen um there is a a quote here now i'm i'm i'm not going to read the the whole thing i don't think this out of lamb and the dove out of lamb and the dove and in this quote you know uh brother branham was just kind of sharing a little bit about being over in the orients and how he was there and and he noticed some shepherds and it's something that just kind of brought a a a a a startling revelation to him and as he noticed these shepherds you know there's a couple things that that he uh that he uh just observed and one was how you know these sheep were following this shepherd and they were just all in one line just kind of going wherever the shepherd went you know if the shepherd stepped to the side like this the sheep would also step to the side the shepherd moved in this direction then the sheep would also move in that direction and brother branham just watched how those sheep was just following the shepherd just just just being led by the shepherd he says and then uh he noticed also that you know at the market they would have uh their food and everything just out there in the open it wouldn't be packaged like when we go to you know to the supermarket today we got it all packaged and if the package itself is broke people don't buy it hey man you know that all they did was just put it in that package and then wrap it right you know that that's all they did they took it from amen it was out uh just out they just grabbed it put it inside the package and wrapped it they got a machine that wraps it and you just see one little poke in the package oh i ain't buying this ain't nothing wrong with the stuff i'm telling you the truth there's nothing wrong with it they oh and all they gonna do when you say you don't want it they're going to go up go back to the back open up the package re-wrap it again and put it back out there when you talk about you ain't going about just pray over your food and eat it and keep on going right but but but you know here they have to just leave it out there you know in the marketplace and he says he noticed the sheep as they were following shepherd he said now they had things that would tempt them amen these uh you know that this food he'd say these pears and all that see these things these are these this is food that the sheep like to eat and their stuff there to tempt that sheep to make it wanna you know maybe deviate a little bit but because the sheep was in tune with the shepherd hallelujah amen it did not fall to the temptation amen it stayed right in line amen going wherever the shepherd went hallelujah and we have to stay in tune with the word of god christ is our chief shepherd and we have to follow him wherever he moves we want to move with him we don't want to get out of line hallelujah glory to god we don't want to get out of step we want to stay in line with what god is calling us to in this hour now here you know i'm going to just read a little bit of this uh and this message the lamb and the dove i think i gave you e1j but i'm going to start at e1k amen e1k and it says this just a little further i seen another shepherd and he was hurting in the field and there was donkeys camels sheep goats all together and i said well that that shepherd's got things all mixed up i said i thought a shepherd just heard its sheep no he said no shepherds can hurt most any kind of animal now i want you to just kind of get that because now don't don't think about this field amen that that they're talking about and thank you lord for the ac thank you god uh but but but don't think about just this field there but think about a church hallelujah amen because in the church you have sheep that come amen you also have wolves that are come acting like sheep praise the lord amen but a shepherd has to be shepherded to everything oh my watch this now amen it says uh a shepherd can herd almost any kind of animal can almost hurt any kind of animal now hey man let's just keep going with here uh he says uh i said well why why is there why is it they all eat together he said they all eat from the same field but he said brother branham the strange thing about this that the shepherd will watch over them and correct each one through the day but when night time comes the donkeys and the camels and the goats go out into the field but the shepherd takes the sheep in the sheepfold all right he says i said uh brother i want to be sheep don't you and he said i often wonder what saint john 10 meant when he said i'm the door to the sheepfold how could he bring a man yet be a door and i asked this good man he said you see brother branham when the sheep are taken in at night the shepherd never lays down until he has counted every sheep hallelujah and then when he lays down he lays across the door and the sheep will never go over the shepherd hallelujah now a goat may go outside but a sheep will always follow shepherd all right now look at it look at what he says here oh hallelujah you know we were when we was there in israel you know uh i was um we were talking uh uh we went to this garden there and there was this man just kind of talking and he was just talking you know just about the shepherd and it says what you think a shepherd uh think about at night what do you think he thinks about it tonight and everybody's kind of quiet the same way y'all quiet right now you know and he said he said the shepherd is always thinking about his sheep he's always thinking about his sheep it's saying the other thing that happened with the shepherds say now you know while they they're grazing here they're eating here today that shepherd has already gone forward amen looking for other pastors oh hallelujah you know i'm not i'm not just thinking about the sermon that i'm preaching right now but i'm already thinking about determining that i gotta preach next i'm i'm never off duty praise god amen but that shepherd amen he has to go before to see because look y'all gonna eat up all the grass over here we're gonna have to have some more grass to take you to glory to god but but when i get there to the grass i gotta really search it out amen because it might be grass but it also may have little holes where where where snakes are sitting down in there hallelujah and that that shepherd got to be careful because while the sheep are eating amen a snake could jump up out of there and hit one on the nose and and now he's sick you can't do nothing with them but the seven is watching all the land make sure there's no rocks there make sure it's grassy and make sure they can eat real good hallelujah glory to god this is the way our god thinks about us god has already gone before us he's already searched out the land he knows it's a good land it's flowing with milk and honey god already knows these things all we got to do is just follow the shepherds don't be a goat in this hour be a sheep hallelujah let's go on in this amen amen amen all right he says uh when the sheep are taking at night the shepherd never lays down until the sheep he has counted every sheep and then when he lays down he lays across the door and the sheep will never go over the shepherd or the wolf cannot get to the sheep without crossing the shepherd see the shepherd becomes the door amen and says i'm and i said i'm so glad to be a sheep this time trials may come and go but to be a sheep brother some glorious day he's going to take us to the sheepfold when the sun goes down i'm glad of that and god saw fit to let his beloved son being represented as a sheep meek gentle little animal he says and then god himself represent himself to the earth he came in the form of the meat of the most meekest bird that flies to heaven the dove it says the dove is a peculiar bird it's a different amen bird from all the other birds in the bible we see it many times it represents the holy spirit and we notice that the dove is also the dove also is a sign of peace the dove also is a sign of peace the peace wonderful peace says it says in noah after the flood was over and judgment had brought uh to the earth and there was peace the dove came back representing peace peace with the olive leaf in his mouth let's just kind of stop there just for a moment here you know we find in the days of noah the earth uh was full of violence just like it is today and jesus said in his word he says as it was in the days of noah so shall it be in the coming of the son of man and there were a couple problems there a lot of violence in the earth in noah's day another big issue was marriage and divorce people getting married and and divorced and remarried and divorced and rematched just a lot of issues like that that was happening happening in those days and uh and it got to the point where god said i'm tired this i got to judge these people i got to judge so he he anointed uh noah gave him a a message amen i believe brother troy was telling us on wednesday night that that was a portal anybody that got inside that ark they were inside the portal they could be they could get through the judgments and here we got to have an ark today that ark is the word of god amen and i want to put it this way the reveal word of god amen because there's many people carrying bibles but they're not inside the ark hallelujah but you have to have the reveal word of god that you're standing on in this hour so here here here noah is bringing the message to the people it's gonna rain it's gonna rain it's gonna rain and uh and finally you know uh all all that preaching 120 years of preaching the only people that noah could get into the ark was his family members what a shame all the other people died outside the ark amen and we we after reading the scripture we know that it rained 40 days and 40 nights and and and every all of mankind died the only ones that were spared with noah and his family the ones that were inside the ark now after the rain had uh stopped uh noah was just kind of waiting for the sun to come out and dry up the earth a little bit and before he would come out of the ark so he he sent a raven out amen or the ark first to maybe go and kind of show some sign as to whether amen the rain had stopped and whether the earth was dry you know before he stepped out he wanted to know so he sent a raven out but the raven never came back hallelujah i believe brother branham tells us that the raven was was comfortable eating amen dead carry on hallelujah glory to god you see a dove got a very special diet hey man a dove just don't eat anything come on somebody hallelujah you just can't eat anything spiritually glory to god you better know what you're eating amen because what you eating got to get you ready for a rapture hallelujah but but here the the the the raven never came back but finally you know uh noah salmon sent a dove out the dove went out and when it went out the bible said could not find a place to rest his feet oh hallelujah and when that dog said i couldn't rest my feet so the dove actually came back to the ark hallelujah there's another thing you need to know about a dove a dove will always go back home oh jesus amen a dove will always go back home it can't find peace and it has to go back home that dove could not find anywhere to rest outside of that ark so it came back home hear that dove you know come back home and and and and uh no wait seven more days say i'm gonna send the dover i can trust this dove i know it's gonna come back if it can't find a place to rest his feet i can trust it it's going to come back so the noah sends it out again hallelujah and this time it comes back with a with an olive leaf in its mouth and that's a symbol for peace that olive leaf was a symbol for peace now it's also showing that amen the wrath of god amen had been accomplished and now uh the earth was dry and man can step out and live again and be fruitful and multiply amen but but this this olive branch was representing peace and not only that god sent this animal a dove out he allowed the dove to go out also symbolizing peace oh hallelujah third time noah sent it out this time the dove didn't come back and it was time for them to come out of the ark but i want you to i want you to catch something here let's let's let's read this in the scripture let's go to john 1. oh hallelujah peace is a person amen jesus christ is the person of peace let's look at john 1 and verse 25. actually verse 24 says and they which were sent were other pharisees my and they asked him and said unto him why baptize us thou then if thou be not that christ nor elias neither that prophet john answered them saying i baptized with water but there standeth one among you whom ye know not he it is who coming after me is preferred before me whose shoes latched i'm not worthy to unloose these things were done in bethabara beyond jordan where john was baptized and look at this the next day john see of jesus coming unto him and said behold the lamb of god which taketh away the sin of the world amen and look at how god amen is i mean uh using this animal's lamb another meek animal amen animal that's willing to give it's all hallelujah look at that says no he says uh the next day john said jesus coming unto him says behold the lamb of god which taketh away the sin of the world this is he of whom i set after me cometh a man which is preferred before me for he was before me amen and i knew him not but that he should be made manifest to israel therefore i come back i therefore am i come baptizing with water and john barrica said i saw the spirit oh hallelujah descending from heaven like a dove and remember dove represents a symbol of peace amen hear this symbol of peace is coming to the person of peace amen hallelujah amen from a heaven like a dove and it'll bold upon him the symbol of peace is coming to this person of peace oh hallelujah hallelujah now let's let's just kind of keep reading this says and i knew him not but he that sent me to baptize with water the same said unto me upon whom thou shalt see the spirit descending and remaining on him the same is he which baptizes with the holy ghost and i saw and bear record that this is the son of god now i like i like this because you know as we just read here amen uh in john 14. you know jesus we realize amen is the person of peace he was a man represented in melchizedek hallelujah was represented in melchizedek it was it was it was god the father represented in melchizedek and god the father is also represented in his son jesus christ it's the same god hallelujah you know but but here we see at the at the baptism of john jesus goes out as a sacrifice that has to be washed before it can be offered here he steps out and john sees the holy spirit like a dove come and settle down on this man jesus that's what identified that this was the one john was looking for now i need to understand the holy spirit came like a dove peace like peace like peace and i told you the only way you're gonna find peace the only way we're gonna have peace is that you got to not just know about jesus you got to know jesus and jesus say my peace i give unto you what peace is that that's the holy ghost and fire that dwells inside of you that gives you overcoming power in this world in which we live my peace holy spirit peace is what's coming into you oh thank you lord jesus now let's look at this amen let's go back and look at uh let me finish that quote there that i was just reading this this piece when the holy ghost is there when the holy ghost is there my i'm telling the holy ghost when you've got his peace dwelling on the inside of you it don't feed off the things of the world amen it don't want the things of the world amen it wants the things of god if you have a desire for the things of the world something wrong with you let me tell you we're getting closer and closer to the coming of the lord amen hallelujah amen we want to draw closer to him look at this he says we could spend much time studying on the dove the dove is one bird yet he could fly like the crow of the scavenger but he can't eat the diet of the scavenger amen because his makeup is different when you got the peace of god dwelling on the inside of you your makeup is different amen he has no gall the dove doesn't have a gall so he cannot digest the things that the scavenger bird would eat hallelujah he can only eat the clean and pure things amen how it types the christian that packs the dove in his heart he just can't stand the foul things of the world amen see he hasn't gotten to god no bitterness about him he's humble humility amen what's what's what's any sweeter than the cool of a dove all right all right all right it's when you have his peace because he said my peace i give unto you that's his holy spirit that's what gives you power to overcome that's what keeps you calm in the midst of a storm i don't care what you're facing just like jesus when he was on that on that stormy sea he could step up and just speak out of his mouth and the whole thing changed you realize you got that dwelling on the inside of you that when everything get rocky all you got to do is open up your mouth and speak to it and watch that thing change you got peace living in you if you got the holy ghost you got peace his peace is living inside of you oh blessed be the name of the lord all right i was looking at this amen uh and the next quote i want to read here is out of key to the door uh last week my my sister uh was here with us and she text she emailed me earlier in the week she would just tell them how blessed she was by the sermon i thank god for that and and she uh she said you know this scripture i was just reading i think just go right along with it i'd say i'm at it so she gave me ephesians 2 14. ephesians 2 14. hallelujah and that's i'm adding i'll assure him for he is our peace for he is our peace who have made both one and have broken down the middle wall of petition between us we had no way to get back to god but when peace came that's why the angels announced peace good will towards oh man when he was born he is our peace we have who have made both one and have broken down the middle wall of petition between us now you know i want to just um take a little uh a a a a time just to kind of break that when when i looked at that word peace in that scripture in the greek lexicon amen it uh it has a number of definitions and and and one of them is it's a state of national tranquility amen exemption from the rage and havoc of war look the only way we're going to have a national tranquility is have everybody meet jesus amen it's it's it means also a peace between individuals a harmony a man uh a harmony uh and just no no this no discord here also security is safety prosperity felicity amen which felicity means intense happiness whoo amen and i like to security safety prosperity felicity amen it says also it's it's the messiah's piece that makes a way and leads a man to salvation glory to god now let me also just kind of uh uh just just state here that when we looked at that scripture in john 14 and verse 27 peace i leave with you my peace i give unto you not as the world giveth give i unto you let not your heart be troubled neither let it be afraid if there was ever time that we needed peace that's this time right now amen i mean the world is is completely overrun with this pandemic people don't know what to do so much has happened and people just don't know what to do but i tell you we can have peace in this our church we can have peace god gives us that kind of peace hallelujah all right let's look at this amen we'll get we'll get is it something that i see everybody moving it just kind of i have to stop and just let let everything get taken care of because i know how that works thank y'all brothers for handling it god bless you all right let's look at this uh let's look at this quote the key to the door key to the door this peace that he gives us a man is it's messiah's peace it's the peace that leads to salvation and and the other definition it says it's a blessed state of devout and upright men after death this peace that i give you it it it caused you to be in a blessed state devout and upright after death remember the man i read to y'all last week that uh you know he died by hit by hit got hit by a car and he could never have peace because there's no peace to the wicked he kept getting hit over and over again hallelujah here we want to have peace we don't have a devout standing before god that this is the peace that he gives us the key to the door says there's only one door to peace yeah my peace i give unto you he's only one door to genuine peace you might think you got peace i like this you might think you got peace amen uh you might accumulate enough money to buy your home you might accumulate enough money to get your children closed have food to eat you but you might have accumulated enough popularity to be popular amongst people but when you slip off your shoes at night and get ready to lay down there's only one thing can give you peace amen that is if you know you were dying that night there's only one peace and that's jesus is the peace he is our peace he is our healing i'm the lord thy god that heals all your diseases he is the door to heaven and there's no other door no or no other way but through jesus christ he is the door to heaven and now jesus is the door to all these things and faith is the key that unlocks the door now jesus is the door to all these promises of god faith in his finished work unlocks every door to every treasure there is inside the kingdom of god see uh faith is the key that unlocks the locks blocks every promise he makes the key of faith does that faith in his finished work is these keys that we're speaking on so jesus is jesus is the door jesus is our healing jesus is our peace he's our peace that passeth all understanding it god it guides and it guards our hearts and minds through christ jesus if there was ever a time to have peace we must have it right now all right now let me uh let go on a little further here i want to read a little bit more last week i read uh two scriptures one is isaiah 53 5 the other is number 6 23-26 well let's read isaiah 53 5. oh my my my my thank you jesus isaiah 53 5 says but he was wounded for our transgressions he was bruised for our iniquities the chastisement of our peace hey if you want peace you have to know you're going to have to know the person of peace the chastisement of our peace was upon him and with his stripes we are healed amen uh i want to read numbers 23 number 6 verse 23-26 amen here the bible says uh speak unto aaron and unto his son saying on this wise ye shall bless the children of israel saying unto them the lord blessed thee and keep thee the lord make his face shine upon thee and be gracious unto thee the lord lift up his countenance upon thee and and i love this blessing from moses and give thee peace oh hallelujah so i clicked on that word peace in isaiah 53 and and i also clicked on the same word piece in number 626 and i found it had the same definition in the hebrew lexicon and let's look at some of these definitions this piece amen this piece that that moses is wishing upon uh the believers this is a prayer that the jewish believers always pray over one another and you know and it's probably one of my favorite scriptures amen the lord lift up his countenance upon thee and give thee peace this word means shalom hallelujah amen this word is shalom in in in the hebrew lexicon it means completeness it means soundness it means welfare amen it's completeness in number it's safety and soundness in body it's welfare health and prosperity this piece cannot can i just put it in layman's terms god wants you to have peace in your finances oh church i'm talking about you ain't worried about how this bill gonna get paid and how that bill gonna get paid god wants you to have peace let me tell you let me just let you in on some secrets if you want that kind of peace you got to be a faithful tithe pair oh hallelujah how do you know that brother jack because he said that if you brought the tithes to the house he said he will rebuke the devil for your sake oh glory to god let me just stop just for a few minutes amen just for a few minutes but you know he said he'll rebuke the devil for your sake amen and i remember years ago glory to god i lost uh lost my job and and uh you know when you lose your job you don't have no income coming in it's hard to have peace it's hard to have peace you worried about how this gonna happen how that it's hard to have peace but but you know as we just kind of just went back to the scripture god you said that you rebuked to the vow for my sake policemen knocking on my front door serving me papers amen but yet and still i could i could have a peace that passeth all understand i don't know how but i know god gonna take care of it because i'm basing myself on this scripture right here you said you rebuked to devour for my faith and before i knew it god had worked things out where they had lowered my my payment my salary had decreased by twenty thousand dollars i had lost in salary but even though my salary decreased they lowered my payments to my to my lower salary to allow me to be able to afford the house god gave me peace in the midst of that oh hallelujah my wife was just having a conversation with somebody and um and you know they were talking about a little something and you know i uh it was a a car that we was looking at and you know we we don't learn these dave ramsey principles so you know if the thing getting in the way that we wanted to be we walk we just get up and walk that's all we do then we go we're going to find the car that we want oh y'all just work with me here if that's what if that's our desire we're going to find it and we're going to find it underneath our terms same thing with the house when you look at my house you gonna just keep looking don't stop looking right so so so so you know uh one guy said you can never find that said okay all right that's what you say i'm gonna drive that same car right back up here and show you that we found it do you want to work the deal or not if not don't worry somebody's got got want to work this deal somebody want to make the money right so so so i you know i uh she was she was talking to this person they were saying well you know maybe it's not the will of the lord for you to get it now that's your revelation ain't what god told me just just because i got told no one time ain't the will of the lord no no no that that that was not the deal but i'm gonna get what i got in my heart hey i'm a possessed of all things right hallelujah so so so so you know i stopped and she was telling me i say yeah you know the scripture even tells say uh bring our tithes to the storehouse he said he'll rebuke the devil for our sake but then he got a some other part to that maybe we need to read it man we need to read it get put put up uh uh uh uh malachi 3. oh my i think it might be 10 or 11 or something like that bring it up bring it up let's just read it because i mean you know we we we live too far beneath our privileges god wants you to have peace in your finances you ain't got to be struggling from year to year put your foot down this year and say no i ain't struggling no more amen i mean yeah at one time abraham was poor but then abraham became very rich the bible even declared that so at some point the season must change and i'm stepping into peace even in my finances i'm stepping into peace even in my body i'm stepping into peace in my family i am stepping into peace give me that scripture sis my god my god amen bring ye all the tithes into the storehouse that there may be meat in my house and here's what god said improve me now herewith saith the lord of hosts if i will not open you the winners of heaven now see that was the other part i mean i think we must have missed uh uh it's the next okay all right i'll stay but this is the first part that we gotta catch i'm gonna open you the windows of heaven and pour you out a blessing that might not be the will of the lord no do not read the same bible that i'm reading if i'm a faithful tithe pair not only he gonna rebuke the divine for my sake but he said i'm going to open up the windows of heaven pour you out a blessing now this ain't any kind of blessing this is a special kind of blessing this is a blessing where you have room not enough to receive it god wants you to have peace in your finances keep on going keep going amen the next verse says and i will rebuke to the vow for your sex i like that i know god blessed me with that house that i got it's testimony behind the house i i mean you ever i went to buy this house and i we put a condition on say now let us sell our first house first and then we'll buy yours man say okay i'll give you three months to do that and i said we we went trying to sell nobody bought that house nobody nobody i said lord what's going on here so the man told me and said look now he knew something that i didn't know but it's okay i still i still take it as a blessing he knew the market was getting ready to crash so he told me say look i will pay six months of your payments on your other house if you just buy my house i said you give me what pretty much he gave me ten thousand dollars he gave me ten thousand dollars to buy his house have you ever had that happen well somebody give you money to buy their house and i said to myself this ain't nothing but god this ain't number god you gonna give me how much i probably could have negotiated and got a little bit more but but but i know that's the hand of god so when the devil came to try to devour it after i lost my job god did his part he rebuked the devil for your sake and he shall not destroy the fruits of your ground neither should your environ cast the fruit before the time in the field sayeth the lord of hosts god wants you to have peace in your finances shalom welfare health prosperity and and you know when i when i when i thought about this it also means peace quiet tranquility contentment and this is when you when you when when uh when when moses says the lord lift up his counts upon thee and give thee peace that's the type of peace is talking about peace in your finances peace in your health peace in your body peace in your family peace everywhere peace on your job peace with your boss peace with your co-workers peace with your the the students in your classroom peace everywhere peace in the church peace in the heart i'm talking about peace peace peace shalom and i thought it was just so perfect that god has listened to the sermon this week shalom amen so since god wants us to have peace everywhere let me just read this quote over you out this just my beginning of the year quote i read it last week i read it brother westco church amen on on new year's eve night i'm reading it again here out of revelation chapter four my god because god wants us to have this kind of peace i'm speaking this over you amen so how mean is glad and happy the lord spared you through another year and here we are coming up to the end of the road glory to god and pray that god will forgive us of all of our sins and our shortcomings he says this now i want to say this before i start i wish to each one of you all the most successful god wants you to have peace in your finances the most successful and blessful and healthy new year that i can wish to you look at this god be with you may you grow both physically and spiritually and financially and materially everything that god can bring upon you i pray that he'll do it man that's something i receive every year when i step into the new year i just received that one and i'm going to tell you something every f for the past few years that i've seen this quote read over the church i have watched god bless his people physically bless them spiritually i saw god bless them financially and i saw god bless them hallelujah hallelujah amen this is the shalom that god wants you to have lord i receive it i receive it amen let me uh just make a little turn here amen at this at this moment this is this is shalom this is shalom this is shalom let me um uh i want to read just a quote from the message shalom hallelujah thank you lord jesus oh my my my my peace i give to you not as the world give it but it's the peace that god that he has that peace that passes all understand that peace that'll cause you to sleep in the midst of your trials because you know who you are god wants you to have that kind of peace don't you be running around like everybody else all frantic and so what we gonna do what we gonna do we gonna open our mouth and we're going to speak we got something that everybody else don't have he's given us his peace look at this other message shalom it says the hour is here i'm at 640119 uh the hours here if i could have been back there before the days that the world was created looked down seeing the whole thing the father had said to me what day would you want to live i would say right now this is the hour this is the greatest hour that the church has ever moved into just before the coming of the bridegroom oh the real church of the living god ought to be on fire burning with the light of the gospel being vindicated among them rise and shine for the light has come to you the light of this day isaiah was the light of his day noah was the light of his day why he had the word manifested and the gospel the bible words for this day is the light of the day what a glorious time that we are living he says now good morning it means peace darkness is gathering what's it what's the gathering for to show the lights isaiah 61 rise and 60 and one rise and shine forth for the light has come to you that's the reason i can say shalom the light has come to you god's peace to the elected woman everybody can receive that but god's peace shalom god's peace to the elected woman and to the elected lady those who god before the foundation world called out and ordained to that to the rest of them they will never see it they'll never know nothing about it the bible said so when jesus said so no man will come to me except my father draws them first and all the fathers giving me will come i want to say god's peace to the elected lady his peace he gives to us you know we're living in a very dark age and this next quote i want to line up here uh i want to just kind of tell a story amen and then all this darkness is sometimes very hard to have peace but when you know that you have christ on the inside you don't have to be worried and frantic and frustrated like everybody else you can actually live in a state of peace everybody else trying to figure out why are you so calm i've met the person of peace and he lives on the inside he actually gave me his piece and you can have it right but but you know you you can stand there uh just so different from everybody else and what it is it's like the story that brother branham told of the the little the family that went to new mexico and they went into the caverns you know and as they were going down i think they called the carlsbad caverns and and as they were going they had to get on the elevator and then as they were standing up top everybody can see everything but as they begin to get lower and lower into these cameras in the elevator uh you know they got to the bottom thing open up and lights would shut off and they say it was so dark if you put your hand in front of your face you would not see your hand say it was extremely dark they call it midnight dark oh my god so there was a little girl standing there with a brother and with a with a father and mother and and that girl was so frantic like i can't see mama i can't see daddy now you can hear voices amen but you can't see nobody and sometimes a man uh hearing is one thing but seeing the manifestation is it's a whole nother thing you know sometimes when you see something it brings a different calm than just a hearing and sometimes when you're seeing it you know you still need to hear something too but but sometimes when you're in a state like where this girl like look i can't see nothing and i know daddy's standing here and i can feel him but actually i don't even know if that's my daddy i don't know if that's my dad it could be anybody i need to lay my eyes on him hallelujah glory to god and sometimes we get to stay we just need to lay our eyes on the promise that's what i'm expecting in this this year we're going to lay our eyes on the promise we don't heard him speak certain things word but now it's time to see what he said become a manifestation amen that girl was sitting there like you know it's kind of dark in here say i can't handle this you know i i know you hear and y'all saying you know and and everybody trying to keep her calm say that girl just just got hysterical so finally her brother began to speak up say uh sis don't worry stop crying stop being so frantic i i i i know i know it look dark right now i know the situation look helpless right now i know i look hopeless right now but since i'm standing next to somebody amen there is a man that i'm standing there and i know he's there i watched him when he came in here i know he's there and not only this man not just standing there but this man has the ability to change the situation this man right here is able to turn on the lights he said so don't worry sis there's a man here that can turn on the lights so in the midst of all that darkness that boy had peace glory to god he had a revelation of who was standing in the room hey if the disciples would have had a revelation who was inside the boat they would have had peace church we know who's with us that's why we have peace in the midst of every storm he said don't worry little sis there's a man here that can turn on the light you can stop crying you can stop stop stop worry you can stop this there's a man standing right here he can turn on the light brother branham says this in the message there's a man that can turn a light so that's about the way it is now that's right it's so dark you don't know where to go so he's bringing it back to a spiritual application and because you know we have people even right now uh some have walked away from this work but i'm gonna tell you right now they don't have peace see peace comes by walking in the reveal word for your day they don't have peace he says this he says that's about it the way it is now that's right it's so dark you don't know where to go you got the you you go to the methodist you go to the baptist you go to the presbyterian it's all the same thing see eating that old dead rotten manna with wiggle tails in it see same thing some creed come in and join us and other than that old creed and everything you don't see christ in it see oh you see self-righteous people i would say so many are fine people in there now in them denominations i'm saying the system not the people in there but you see that's what they're eating on tell them about it and look at this he says and here is fresh food where where's the fresh food where the message of the hour is being preached here is fresh food and this little girl standing there she was screaming type of voice a man uh about to go into hysterics about like the little bride is but you know what her little brother cried out said little sister don't fear because we have standing right by he's because he was standing right by the engine and said there's a man who can turn on the lights don't fear little sister there's a man here who can turn on the light he can make this world live i want to tell you every promise that he made you he can make it live we don't know how he's coming we don't know when he's coming i don't know nothing about that but he is here and he can turn on the lights how we going to get out of it i don't know but he's here oh hallelujah bro jack when we gonna move into our new church i don't know i don't know but i know there's a man here that can turn on lights it's a man that turned on air conditioner there's also a man that can turn on lights [Applause] i'm just not gonna get hysterical i'ma just be patient and just wait hallelujah oh thank you lord i don't know nothing about it but he is here and he can turn on the lights how we're going to get out of it i don't know but he's here and he's the he's the one that can turn on the lights yes sir he is the one he is he is the light amen he just makes himself known that's how he turns on the light exactly right it takes christ to flash away on his lights then all the darkness scatters he separates he is pulling his little bride out amen i'll take people out of the gentiles for my name six that's that'll have my name what is his name all right not methodist baptist presbyterian lutheran it's jesus christ that's his name that's right he is the light the truth the light and there's no darkness in him and he scatters amen the darkness when he comes in because he is the word the word is the light that's right because he spoke and said let there be light that was the word that become light when he speaks this it's the light of the of that age each time praise the lord all right uh you know what uh yeah okay so let me uh kind of come home with with this i was saying earlier how the way that uh god used the dove in the beginning with noah that dove went out of the ark came back with that olive leaf in his mouth and that was that that olive leaf has been a symbol of peace in the dove as well has been a similar piece to mankind uh for generations and most of them don't realize that's where it came from right out of the scripture that god's judgment had been performed and now he was having peace with man again noah would begin to be the beginning of this and here the spirit you know when jesus was baptized the spirit like a dove came and settled on jesus that same spirit is the peace that he gives us and that lives inside of us hallelujah god has always used the dove amen as a symbol of peace a dove is a man uh uh a a special animal you know uh there was a a couple statements that brother branham made about the dove let me just give that to you and i'm gonna just tell you something we'll be we'll move on he says the dove is a symbol of peace in every nation it says because of its gentleness because of its innocence that's the reason it's the symbol of peace and it says the dove is a home loving bird say the dub loves to stay home it says another thing about the dove is loyal to its mate it like to stay home it's a home loving bird like to stay home and is loyal to his mate you know years ago we we went to kimberly south africa and there in kimberly they have the the great diamond mines that they would they would they would mine and get diamonds and everything but the way things were done there in kimberley is that there was one big company i think called de beers and they just owned all the diamond mines so they they never get down their mind but they own any diamond that come out of there and you have men that would go down there into uh the mines and and they would uh they would uh they would be out there chipping and getting this and getting that and pulling all these these rich diamonds out of the rock and loading them into some cart and taking them back up and the beers just taking them away and and and chipping them and and making money lots of money off it so these these guys that were workers in the diamond mine they realized man there's a lot of money to this it's a lot of money in this you know i mean we ain't getting nothing we just getting paid for labor just to chip them out but it's more money and what we chipping at than just chipping these guys got smart so they start coming to work with a pet dove they had a pet dove that they just come on no no big deal you know and i just i feel better with this dove next you know some people go on the plane they got their dogs you know i just went up there to the north carolina i jumped into a seat uh uh you know i'm just spread out a little bit and i jumped into this little seat and said say anybody sitting here no no i said okay i sat down and you know in between it's just an empty seat and next thing you notice i hear a roof roughly they got a dog down here no that's why ain't nobody want this seat but uh but you know people it's their comfort you know whatever but these guys said you know we we got a plan here i'm gonna just take my dove and get down there and they chip off some of that rock they put a little rock over here in the um in the bin and they take a little rock and tie it to the dove foot and the dove they say now you can uh they i guess around lunch time just let the dove go go go you know get on out of here i'm going back to work they knew where that dove was going a dove liked to go a dove will go back home i mean even if you're going to funerals and you see people bring them them doves a symbol of peace right and when they when they release to dove some sometimes they don't get it released but but when they release that dove i don't care that dove can be miles away and that dove might take off going in this direction but before you know it it starts swinging and it's going right back to where it come from and by the time that owner get back home they know all them doves coming right back six seven eight nine ten don't matter they'll turn off go this way but they got to get back home because they are home loving birds brother branham told a story of a book that he was reading one time of how the the army was all pinned down and um they were fighting there in the war and they got so pinned down they they could not figure out how to get out of situation they'd run out of ammunition and they were just they were just really stuck they were messed up they knew that their only hope was to uh forgot to work some type of miracle so you know as they were there you know on the battlefield just kind of waiting uh waiting things out they finally realized one of the guys said you know i got a pigeon carry i got a dove here and uh what we can do is tie a little message on the dove's foot maybe you know it'll get back to the rest of the arm and we'll tell them exactly where we are tell them we out of ammunition tell them if we don't get help right away we're gonna die and they tied the little message to the foot on that dove and and that dove uh you know again it's a home loving bird so that dove rolls up from the middle of the the the battlefield and when the dove rose up the other army realized what was going on they knew about about they knew now see if it bit a crow they wouldn't have worried about it right if it would have been some other type of bird they would have never worried about but because they could see that's enough oh hallelujah they say they know based on a man this did that particular animal he ain't just flying just to be flying and maybe they probably also knew that we don't even have them type of birds over here but that bird there that bird has a message oh hallelujah and he said he said he'd say that that that bird they began to shoot at the birds say you know they took every gun they could aim to that that bird and he just dodging them bullets maybe got hit in one wing maybe got hit in one foot or something like that but he just dodging his his whole objective that bird is not not to go back down in the battlefield that bird got one thing on the inside say i got to get back home hallelujah and somehow somewhere they say that the dove came crashing into you know a home base and and when they realized the dove i mean not people not running from the dub they actually run into the dove they realize if this does made us back it's got something to tell us and if they looked and saw tied to his foot was a little note as to exactly where the army was and how they was out of ammunition the rest of them got their gear on and went right to that spot and saved their brothers see that dove brings peace and the dove of the holy spirit is here to bring you peace oh thank you jesus let me uh finish off with this little quote here the second quote on shalom here um the prophet says this remember when the full bible listen and closing when this full bible has been thoroughly vindicated then there will be an eternal shalom and and i'm gonna tell you um we have peace especially being message believers that a lot of other people don't have you know people people so concerned about the vaccine as if it was the you know they think it's the mark of the beast they're misinformed they're misinformed and it's not to make you go out and get the vaccine but just don't use that as an excuse that is the market of beasts don't say that that's not right that's not right if the mark of the beast was the vaccine then it would have been it would when brother branham was dealing with the salk vaccine his day it would have been a mark of the beast den right but don't don't say things like that but a lot of people a lot lot i mean i told you i was listening to somebody some well-known guy saying you know people what they call it uh not take the shot take the jab take the jab you took the jab and pretty much say you you couldn't even be forgiven of sin if you took the job like wow where'd y'all get that from what scripture you looking at on that right but it's just you know just just just misinformed but here we have a message a vindicated message and you want to know who who actually have shalom who actually have peace people that's following this vindicated word you have peace my peace i give to you not like the world i give you this piece oh my let's look at this it says uh the full bible listen uh and close and when this full bible has been thoroughly vindicated then there will be an eternal shalom eternal peace see he come and he was peace on earth good will towards men man but the world didn't receive it see see he was the peace to everyone that come to him for peace say peace on earth good will to man he was the peace at that new year beginning new day of god for why he was a vindicated light of that day see but there is more word to be a vindicated he's got to vindicate more word and when the last word is vindicated is vindicated rather than death is swallowed up in victory and the dead in christ shall rise the millennium will set in it'll be one great peace shalom let's live for that day brother sister for that one great shalom remember the bible is the fountain of all wisdom and holds all hopes to the future to the church shalom let us pray let's pray father we thank you that you are
