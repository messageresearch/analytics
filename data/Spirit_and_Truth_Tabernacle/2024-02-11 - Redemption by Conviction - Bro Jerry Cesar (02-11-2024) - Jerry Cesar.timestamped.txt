[9:07] whenever you are a friend of God it
[9:10] becomes personal to God when God came
[9:13] down the days of Abraham he said would I
[9:15] hide anything from my friend that was
[9:18] one thing but when Jesus Christ came he
[9:20] came and he came before his disciples
[9:22] and said it's given to you to know the
[9:24] mysteries of the of the Kingdom it's not
[9:26] given to them then when our prophet
[9:29] comes in this age he will always stand
[9:31] before the people and say good morning
[9:34] friends because whenever God comes down
[9:36] and he's a friend to you he gives you
[9:39] understanding of what's going on he
[9:41] wants you to know what's going on in
[9:43] your day he's not withholding his

[43:56] name of Jesus
[43:58] Christ you know our pastor reached out
[44:00] to me and he asked me of this of this
[44:03] request and surely I thought there was
[44:05] more capable brothers that could step in
[44:07] this morning uh but I remember the
[44:10] message of last week and I said Lord
[44:12] here am
[44:13] I so we want to thank God for his word
[44:16] we want to thank God for what he's been
[44:17] doing in in the midst of his Saints and
[44:20] most importantly we want to we want to
[44:22] invite him in our midst this morning we
[44:24] want to thank him because he's already
[44:25] here
[44:26] is that right praise God
[44:30] now throughout the week I was thinking
[44:32] it's it's been about five years or so
[44:35] since I've been before you all on the
[44:37] Sunday
[44:38] morning and uh you know I just I was
[44:40] just thinking about that and I realize
[44:42] that it's it's a real honor and
[44:44] privilege uh to be able to break the
[44:46] bread of of life to you all so without
[44:49] delay we may stand up and we'll go ahead
[44:51] and read the
[44:54] scripture praise God
[44:56] God we want to turn our Bibles this
[44:59] morning to Matthew
[45:02] 27 and we'll read the first 11 verses
[45:05] there and just say Amen when you're
[45:09] there praise God Matthew
[45:15] 27
[45:17] amen and it reads when the morning was
[45:20] come all the chief priests and Elders of
[45:23] the people took counsel against Jesus to
[45:26] put him to death and when they had bound
[45:29] him they led him away and delivered him
[45:32] to Pontius Pilate the governor then
[45:34] Judas which had betrayed him when he saw
[45:38] that he was condemned repented himself
[45:40] and brought again the 30 pieces of
[45:42] silver to the chief priests and Elders
[45:45] saying I have sinned and that I have
[45:47] betrayed the innocent blood and they
[45:49] said what is that to us see that thou to
[45:52] that and he cast down the pieces of
[45:54] silver in the temple and departed and
[45:57] when he hanged himself and the chief
[45:59] priests took the silver pieces and said
[46:01] it is not lawful for to put the uh them
[46:04] into the treasury because it is the
[46:06] price of blood and they took counsel and
[46:09] brought with the with them the Potter
[46:11] field to bury strangers in wherefore
[46:14] that field was called the field of blood
[46:16] unto this day then was fulfilled that
[46:19] which was spoken by Jeremy the prophet
[46:22] saying and they took the 30 pieces of
[46:23] silver the price of him that was was
[46:26] valued whom they of the children of
[46:28] Israel did value and gave them for The
[46:31] Potter's field as the Lord appointed me
[46:34] and Jesus stood before the governor and
[46:36] the governor asked saying art thou the
[46:38] king of the Jews and Jesus said unto him
[46:42] thou sayest let us
[46:45] pray Heavenly Father Lord Jesus we're
[46:50] honored to be here this morning to honor
[46:53] your Resurrection Lord for Lord God you
[46:56] Rose on the third day father and you
[46:58] said those words that it is finished and
[47:01] you settled it at that moment Lord and
[47:03] when know father when you speak your
[47:05] word Lord God it must come to pass and
[47:07] father God you have ordained this day
[47:09] Lord that we would gather together
[47:11] father you have promised where we would
[47:13] be gathered Lord you would be in the
[47:14] midst God I pray that you would speak to
[47:17] the hearts of your people father God
[47:19] lord father I pray you would circumcise
[47:21] the hearts of your people Lord that God

[47:26] edified Lord God with a revelation of
[47:28] Father God of who they are oh God and
[47:30] what's been given to them in this hour
[47:32] oh Father God and Lord God we know
[47:34] there's many needs to this morning
[47:36] Father God Lord God we know our precious
[47:39] sister Melissa reached out father we ask

[48:12] peace oh Father God we thank you and we
[48:14] invite you in our midst this morning we
[48:17] ask these things in the name of Jesus
[48:18] Christ amen am praise the Lord you may
[48:22] have your
[48:23] seats may the Lord add a blessing to his
[48:26] reading uh there's another scripture I
[48:28] want to read as well uh Matthew 24 verse
[48:32] 24 Matthew 24 verse
[48:37] 24 praise God and it reads for there
[48:40] shall arise false Christ and false
[48:43] prophets and shall show great signs and
[48:46] wonders in so much that if it were
[48:49] possible they shall deceive the very
[48:52] elect praise the Lord and if I could use
[48:55] as a title this morning it would
[48:58] be Redemption by conviction and as a
[49:02] subtitle I want to use the very elect
[49:06] praise God the very elect now going back
[49:09] to Matthew 27 that first verse right it
[49:13] says when the morning was come and I
[49:16] like that because you see the morning is
[49:19] a person right when the morning was come
[49:23] the people in those days didn't realize
[49:26] who was among them it was a glorious day
[49:29] right the scripture says weeping may
[49:31] endure for a night but joy comes in the
[49:34] morning is that right you see when the
[49:36] morning was come it says all the chief
[49:38] priests and Elders of the people took
[49:39] counsel against him to put him to death
[49:43] these are the religious leaders that uh
[49:46] rather than taking heed to the voice of
[49:48] God they were taking heed to the voice
[49:49] of their Traditions you see
[49:53] now what I find interesting here is you
[49:57] know Judas got to a place where he
[50:01] realized he shed innocent blood he
[50:03] realized that he he he did something
[50:06] that he he he had great regrets for you
[50:09] see and when conviction occurs
[50:11] repentance always follows but when
[50:13] conviction is rejected then the
[50:15] repentance is made void and that's what
[50:17] happened to Judas you see he felt that
[50:20] conviction but there was nothing in him
[50:23] that could restore him back from his
[50:25] repentance you see restoration only
[50:28] applies to those that have something to
[50:30] be restored back to and I know our
[50:33] pastor has been carrying on this thought
[50:35] of restoration so I'm just going to take
[50:37] a few pointers this morning if that's
[50:39] all right you see repentance is a gift
[50:43] only until true conviction is gone and I
[50:46] encourage anyone that whenever you have
[50:49] that opportunity to repent make it right
[50:53] you see make it right now restoration
[50:56] takes place beyond any fruits you might
[50:59] produce in your
[51:00] life you see and I think very
[51:02] interestingly you'll find yourself going
[51:05] through life's journey bearing many
[51:07] fruits and I want you to keep in mind
[51:09] that God never spoke fruits into
[51:11] existence he spoke seeds you see now
[51:15] with that in mind you bear fruit based
[51:18] on what seed you identify with is that
[51:21] right so it's important to identify with
[51:24] the right seed because there's a true
[51:27] seed of God and then there's a false
[51:30] seed of God you see that's why the
[51:32] scripture says if it were possible it
[51:35] would deceive the very elect and I trust
[51:38] I'm speaking to the very elect this
[51:39] morning Hallelujah the prophet says this
[51:41] in a message the serian church age he
[51:44] says hold this carefully in mind now
[51:47] take this next step redeem means to buy
[51:50] back it restores the original to the
[51:53] original owner God by his death the shed
[51:57] blood brought back his own now I want
[52:00] you to keep that in mind I'm going to
[52:01] read that again it says God by his death
[52:04] the shed blood brought back his own he
[52:07] brought back the spoken word seed bride
[52:11] he brought back the spoken word seed
[52:13] bride now if he brought back the spoken
[52:16] word seed bride that means the spoken
[52:18] word isn't just an attribute of the
[52:20] Bride it isn't just a possession of the
[52:22] Bride it is the bride you are a very
[52:25] spoken word of God amen amen now the
[52:29] prophet says that the life is in the
[52:31] blood and the blood is the bride so I
[52:35] believe it's time Church to realize that
[52:37] you are Supernatural people living in an
[52:40] Earthly condition amen now the prophet
[52:44] goes on he says the blood speaks did we
[52:47] say does the blood speak can it speak
[52:49] says yes sir he says the voice of the
[52:52] blood of Abel cried out against Cain we
[52:55] find out in Hebrews 12:24 that the blood
[52:58] of Jesus Christ speaks better things the
[53:01] blood speaks how can the chemistry speak
[53:04] it's the life that's in the blood that
[53:07] does the speaking the soul that was in
[53:09] Abel cried out was the life that was in
[53:12] Christ cries out a better thing it
[53:14] speaks it speaks loud it's the holy
[53:17] spirit amen and I believe the the very
[53:20] elect this morning has been called to a
[53:23] very special purpose
[53:25] amen there's a promise that lays in the
[53:28] roots of the the elect this morning and
[53:32] it's and I and I our brother's been
[53:34] preaching on this and one of the things
[53:38] to keep in mind is many times we'll
[53:41] waiting for the promises of God to be
[53:43] fulfilled we're waiting for God's
[53:45] promises to come to pass in our lives
[53:48] right we look at the word and we we we
[53:50] claim it as our own but a lot of times
[53:53] the promis of God is waiting for you
[53:56] you you're not waiting for the promise
[53:58] the promise is waiting for you for you
[54:00] to get in position for you to get into
[54:02] step amen now when we understand that
[54:07] then we can get into
[54:09] step the prophet says here whatever life
[54:12] was in the seed came forth into a plant
[54:17] and then into a fruit this very quote
[54:21] this was a a time where the angel spoke
[54:23] to the prophet of God and says pick up
[54:25] your pen and write it goes on to say the
[54:28] very same law applies to the church
[54:30] today whatever seed started the church
[54:33] will come forth and be like the Original
[54:35] Seed the spoken word because it is the
[54:38] same seed and these last days the true
[54:42] bride Christ seed will come to The
[54:43] Headstone and she will be the Super
[54:46] Church a super race as she nears him
[54:49] they and the bride will be so much like
[54:52] him that they will even be in his very
[54:55] image this is in order to be United with
[54:58] him they will be one what a condition
[55:01] church this is where we ought to be just
[55:05] before the Rapture you see we are that
[55:09] super church we are that super race you
[55:12] see so whatever need there is that comes
[55:16] upon you it's time to speak to that need
[55:18] this morning it's time to Speak Life to
[55:21] it amen now the prophet had many VIs ISS
[55:26] and a lot of times in his Visions um the
[55:29] prophet had to had to wait until certain
[55:32] things were in position for that Vision
[55:35] to come to pass amen now he he the
[55:38] smallest thing could be out of place but
[55:41] he had to wait for it you see and a lot
[55:45] of times when we find ourselves in the
[55:49] word of God right there are certain
[55:51] things that need to be in place before
[55:53] it can come to pass it need to be in the
[55:55] right season for it to come to pass amen
[55:59] now want to turn to John chapter 12
[56:03] here this is a time where
[56:07] Christ was doing great Miracles before
[56:10] the people and there was a great need
[56:13] there was this man that had died and he
[56:16] was in the grave for a few days you see
[56:20] and when he got to the crowd there was
[56:23] an expectation because Christ was there
[56:26] now verse 17 it says the people
[56:28] therefore that was with him when he
[56:30] called Lazarus out of the grave and
[56:33] raised him from the dead bear record for
[56:36] this cause the people also met him for
[56:38] that they heard that he had done this
[56:40] miracle now after Christ had done this
[56:43] miracle there was a Fame about him that
[56:46] there there were certain Greeks however
[56:48] that came and that says you know we we
[56:51] want to see this Christ s we can we
[56:55] would like to see Christ we would like
[56:56] to see this man you see but when Christ
[56:59] was there Christ had the opportunity
[57:03] to reveal himself to those to the Greeks
[57:06] he had the opportunity to let them know
[57:08] that I am he right but there's response
[57:11] was in verse 20 24 he says verily verily
[57:15] I say unto you except a corn of wheat
[57:17] fall into the ground and die it abideth
[57:21] alone but if it die it bringeth forth
[57:24] much fruit you see Christ didn't point
[57:26] to himself he pointed to the word he
[57:30] pointed to the very substance that could
[57:32] reproduce more fruit you see and when
[57:37] when you when you recognize that you
[57:39] find these Greeks they were they were
[57:41] looking at a man you see because there
[57:45] was a situation where Christ had need to
[57:47] stop by a certain place to speak to a
[57:50] certain woman you see and with this
[57:53] woman she she she when she was there it
[57:56] was a Samaritan woman she her response
[57:59] was our fathers worshiped in this
[58:01] mountain she says I know the Messiah
[58:03] cometh you see which is called Christ
[58:06] when he come he will tell us thing these
[58:09] things you see but this Samaritan woman
[58:12] she wasn't just looking at a man she was
[58:14] looking at a promise you see and the
[58:17] promise was already there waiting for
[58:19] her she was wait she thought she might
[58:21] have been waiting for the promise to
[58:23] come to pass but the promise was waiting
[58:25] for her and she says I the the Christ
[58:28] said I am he that speaketh to thee you
[58:31] see she was looking at a promise so the
[58:34] promise could be made revealed and
[58:36] anytime there's a conviction or
[58:38] expectation for God's word God's
[58:40] obligated to reveal it to you amen
[58:44] another scene we we just read it with
[58:46] with Pontius Pilate he asked Christ are
[58:50] thou the king of the Jews and Jesus said
[58:53] to him thou sayest
[58:55] you see same scene but two different
[58:57] results are you looking at a man or are
[59:00] you looking at the promise of God are
[59:02] you looking at what God spoke in this
[59:04] day you see the Promise always lies on
[59:08] the other side the three Hebrew boys had
[59:11] to enter into a fire but there was a
[59:14] promise on the other side that he would
[59:16] show up you see non had a condition in
[59:19] his body you see but he was given a
[59:22] promise that was waiting for him on the
[59:24] other side he had to dip himself in that
[59:26] River seven times before he can receive
[59:29] healing I encourage you this morning
[59:31] that whatever you have need of it's
[59:33] already waiting for you on the other
[59:35] side praise God amen
[59:38] amen feel like brother smiling I'm
[59:40] starting to feel
[59:42] good praise the Lord now now I can get
[59:45] to my real
[59:47] message
[59:48] amen now Redemption by
[59:52] conviction conviction means means a
[59:55] firmly held belief or
[59:57] opinion the quality of showing that one
[59:59] is firmly convinced or what one says or
[1:00:03] believes that's what conviction means
[1:00:06] now conviction is absolutely necessary
[1:00:08] for your journey as a Christian it's
[1:00:11] necessary when you're on offense and
[1:00:13] when you're on defense the absence of
[1:00:15] conviction will cause you to be
[1:00:17] complacent that's how important
[1:00:19] conviction is you see now if we turn to
[1:00:23] Matthew 15 what find somebody that
[1:00:26] showed us an example of what conviction
[1:00:28] looks
[1:00:29] like praise the Lord Matthew
[1:00:38] 15:21 now it reads then Jesus went then
[1:00:43] and departed into the coast of Tyrie and
[1:00:45] sidon and behold a woman of Canaan came
[1:00:49] out of the same coast and Cried unto him
[1:00:52] saying have mercy on me oh Lord Lord
[1:00:54] thou son of David my daughter is
[1:00:57] grievously vexed with the devil now this
[1:01:00] was a mother's cry for her daughter you
[1:01:02] see and I want you to notice this this
[1:01:05] this woman here this sof phenician woman
[1:01:08] was a gentile so she had no claims on
[1:01:12] Christ as the son of David right but
[1:01:15] that's that's what she she heard she was
[1:01:18] around she she knew all the people
[1:01:20] regarded him as son of David Son of
[1:01:22] David have mercy on me now it goes on to
[1:01:25] say but he answered her not a word now
[1:01:28] how many time has the Lord answered you
[1:01:30] not a word to your prayers what do you
[1:01:33] do in these situations you have a need
[1:01:36] you're desperate and the Lord answers
[1:01:38] you not a
[1:01:39] word let us keep going do you cease from
[1:01:43] praying now it goes on to say his
[1:01:45] disciples came and besought him saying
[1:01:48] send her away for she crith after us
[1:01:51] even his disciples wanted to send her
[1:01:53] away but he answered and said I am not
[1:01:56] sent unto the lost sheep of of the House
[1:01:58] of is I'm not sent unto the lost sheep
[1:02:00] but to the house of
[1:02:02] Israel then came she and worshiped him
[1:02:06] saying Lord help me you see look look at
[1:02:09] her approach her approach was I've been
[1:02:14] asking for this I'm in desperation I've
[1:02:16] exhausted all my
[1:02:18] resources but she says Lord help
[1:02:21] me so worship will change your
[1:02:23] atmosphere worship will allow you to
[1:02:26] enter into a different playing field
[1:02:28] where you can expect something from
[1:02:31] God but he a verse 26 but he answered
[1:02:34] and said it is not meat to take the
[1:02:38] children's bread and to cast it to dogs
[1:02:41] see not only did he not respond when she
[1:02:44] when when when she first asked but now
[1:02:47] he calls her a dog it's not meat for me
[1:02:50] to cast a children's bread and feed it
[1:02:51] to dogs you see now what would your
[1:02:54] reaction be if God calls you a
[1:02:58] dog you
[1:03:00] see
[1:03:02] now it goes on to
[1:03:04] say she said truth Lord this was her
[1:03:08] conviction see she was willing to to to
[1:03:12] let Christ in every door of her life the
[1:03:15] door of her Pride right the the the door
[1:03:18] of her temperament every door of her
[1:03:21] life she was willing to let Christ in so
[1:03:23] he could bring correct
[1:03:25] you see she says truth Lord yet the dogs
[1:03:28] eat the crumbs which fall from their
[1:03:30] master's table so she knew that even the
[1:03:34] crumbs was sufficient enough to meet her
[1:03:36] need you see little is much when God is
[1:03:39] in it verse 28 then Jesus answered her
[1:03:44] said who oh woman great is thy faith be
[1:03:48] it unto thee as thou Wilt and her
[1:03:51] daughter was made whole from that very
[1:03:53] hour so church I encourage you if you
[1:03:56] have a need this morning what is your
[1:03:59] approach what is your mindset are you
[1:04:02] expecting something from God because
[1:04:04] this this woman here she received a
[1:04:07] two-fold reward she was commended of her
[1:04:10] great faith faith and her daughter was
[1:04:12] healed at that very moment you see she
[1:04:14] took the lowliest place but her faith in
[1:04:18] Christ earned her the highest
[1:04:20] praise her faith was tested by his
[1:04:23] silence but her faith was recognized by
[1:04:26] her conviction she says truth Lord
[1:04:29] praise the Lord
[1:04:32] amen and I'd like to just add this as
[1:04:34] well although she was a gentile by birth
[1:04:38] she became a spiritual
[1:04:40] Israelite because of her
[1:04:42] faith and that's that's the same faith
[1:04:46] that it requires of us today the faith
[1:04:48] to continue to persevere through any
[1:04:50] situation you see we are not the Royal
[1:04:54] seed by a of the royal Seed of Abraham
[1:04:57] by flesh we are the Royal Seed of
[1:04:59] Abraham by faith you see when you have
[1:05:03] that Faith then you can start contending
[1:05:06] for what's yours for what belongs to you
[1:05:09] praise the Lord Galatians 3 says know ye
[1:05:13] therefore that they which are of Faith
[1:05:16] the same are the children of Abraham
[1:05:18] praise the lord we want to also turn
[1:05:20] here to Matthew 8 we see another example
[1:05:24] example
[1:05:26] here of one's great
[1:05:29] desperation call God on the
[1:05:31] scene Matthew
[1:05:34] 8 verse 5 it says when Jesus was entered
[1:05:37] into capernium there came unto him a
[1:05:41] centurion beseeching him and saying Lord
[1:05:45] my servant lith at home sick of the py
[1:05:47] grievously tormented and Jesus saith
[1:05:50] unto him I will come and heal him the
[1:05:53] Centurion answered answered and says
[1:05:54] Lord I am not worthy that thou should us
[1:05:56] come under my roof but speak the word
[1:05:59] only and my servant shall be healed see
[1:06:03] he believed that at the very spoken word
[1:06:06] whatever KN he had would come to pass
[1:06:09] there is power in the spoken word Saints
[1:06:12] the spoken word is your possession this
[1:06:15] morning I've said it before you are the
[1:06:17] spoken word praise
[1:06:19] God John chapter
[1:06:23] n verse
[1:06:25] three in this scene here we see we see a
[1:06:28] blind man a blind man that was born in
[1:06:33] that condition by
[1:06:35] birth and you know they asked Christ
[1:06:38] what did this man do that he was blind
[1:06:42] and Christ says he did nothing but he is
[1:06:44] blind so that the works of God could be
[1:06:46] made manifest amen
[1:06:50] now Jesus told him to go wash in the
[1:06:54] pool of
[1:06:55] salom which is interpreted sent he went
[1:06:59] in his way therefore and wash and he
[1:07:02] came back seeing now this very scene
[1:07:05] created a lot of contention among the
[1:07:07] people because there were religious
[1:07:09] leaders in those days that had different
[1:07:11] things to say about what happened right
[1:07:14] in verse
[1:07:15] 26 it says then said they to him again
[1:07:18] what did he to thee how opened he Thine
[1:07:22] Eyes he answered answer them I have told
[1:07:25] you already and ye did not hear
[1:07:28] wherefore would you hear it again will
[1:07:30] ye also be his
[1:07:32] disciples now this man is now testifying
[1:07:36] and witnessing to these religious
[1:07:38] leaders you
[1:07:40] see verse 28 says then they reviled him
[1:07:43] and says Thou Art his disciples but we
[1:07:46] are Moses disciples we know that God
[1:07:49] spake unto Moses as for this fellow we
[1:07:52] know not from whence he is the man
[1:07:55] answered and said unto him why herein is
[1:07:59] a marvelous thing that ye know not from
[1:08:02] whence he is and yet he hath opened my
[1:08:04] eyes now we know that God heareth not
[1:08:07] Sinners you see now he's not he he's
[1:08:11] recognizing what had happened to him and
[1:08:14] he knows that there's got to be a
[1:08:15] something wrong here either with my
[1:08:17] experience or your experience and
[1:08:20] sometimes you're going to come across
[1:08:22] people that had certain experiences but
[1:08:25] with no substance we're going to get
[1:08:27] into that a little
[1:08:28] later now this man was talking from a
[1:08:31] convicted
[1:08:32] heart anytime you have a conviction like
[1:08:35] that it will lead you to the path of
[1:08:37] righteousness you see it goes on to say
[1:08:40] verse 31 now we know that God heareth
[1:08:43] not Sinners but if any man be a
[1:08:44] worshipper of God and doeth His will him
[1:08:47] he heareth you see now since the word
[1:08:51] began was it not heard that any man Open
[1:08:53] the Eyes of one that was born blind if
[1:08:56] this man were not of God he could do
[1:08:58] nothing this man's conviction made him a
[1:09:01] witness unto unto those people in those
[1:09:04] days and uh verse 34 says they answered
[1:09:08] unto him thou was altogether born in
[1:09:10] sins and thou th and dust thou teach us
[1:09:15] and they cast him out now they got real
[1:09:17] offended because they realize that this
[1:09:20] man that was born in sin that that that
[1:09:23] that was out of the temple is now
[1:09:24] teaching us you see and they cast him
[1:09:28] out the scripture says and I want you to
[1:09:30] know that the enemy's report is not for
[1:09:32] you we're going to find that in the next
[1:09:34] verse you see the relig these religious
[1:09:37] leaders lacked Revelation and the
[1:09:40] absence of Revelation in in in your life
[1:09:42] will cause you to follow a word with no
[1:09:44] substance they were following a word but
[1:09:47] it was a word out of season they were in
[1:09:49] Moses day but it was a new
[1:09:52] day praise the Lord
[1:09:55] and you see verse 35 it says Jesus heard
[1:09:58] that they had cast him out and when he
[1:10:00] had found him he said unto him dust thou
[1:10:03] believe on the Son of God and he
[1:10:05] answered and says who is he Lord that I
[1:10:08] might believe on him and Jesus says Thou
[1:10:11] Hast both seen him and he it is that
[1:10:14] talketh with thee and he said Lord I
[1:10:17] believe and he worshiped him you see so
[1:10:20] the real ones that was cast out of the
[1:10:21] temple was not this blind man it was
[1:10:24] those religious leaders you see and
[1:10:26] there's a clear difference between
[1:10:28] what's true and what's false see a lot
[1:10:31] of times if I could use this as an
[1:10:33] example if you're going to this uh
[1:10:36] Bakery uh maybe you're shopping for a
[1:10:38] wedding cake right and you're looking on
[1:10:41] the Shelf the first thing that catches
[1:10:43] your attention is the icing on that cake
[1:10:46] the icing got to be right if there's a
[1:10:48] cake on one of those counters that don't
[1:10:50] have the the the right decoration with
[1:10:52] the icing you won't be drawn to it you
[1:10:55] see uh uh uh but but but that cake has
[1:10:58] just enough icing to draw you to to to
[1:11:01] to make it more appealing you see and
[1:11:03] and and that's the difference between
[1:11:05] the false and the true is that the false
[1:11:08] church right it's like they it's like
[1:11:10] that icing they they have enough to to
[1:11:14] draw you to them they have the big
[1:11:15] crowds they have the they have all these
[1:11:17] great things right but is there any
[1:11:20] substance in that cake you see is there
[1:11:23] any substance in that cake in fact I
[1:11:26] heard his preacher say this one time too
[1:11:28] much icing will make you sick if you
[1:11:31] have too much icing right you won't be
[1:11:33] able to really digest it as well right
[1:11:36] but you need that substance you can see
[1:11:38] that cake but what's inside of it that's
[1:11:41] what makes the difference and what's
[1:11:42] inside of the true is the word of God
[1:11:45] that's it yes sir heavens and earth will
[1:11:47] pass away but my word will not praise
[1:11:50] the
[1:11:51] Lord now
[1:11:54] we want to continue
[1:11:57] here praise God in 1st
[1:12:02] Samuel chapter 30 want to just read a f
[1:12:06] a few verses
[1:12:08] there
[1:12:11] amen praise God and as you go to that I
[1:12:14] just thought it was very interesting
[1:12:16] that this blind man he was never able to
[1:12:19] to see anything he was born in as a
[1:12:21] blind man never able to see
[1:12:24] anything but yet in the presence of God
[1:12:28] he became the light of that day you see
[1:12:31] he saw Darkness all of his life but he
[1:12:33] was the very light of his
[1:12:36] day in 1st Samuel chapter 30 it goes on
[1:12:38] to
[1:12:39] say and it came to
[1:12:42] pass when David and his men will come to
[1:12:46] zlac on the third day that the
[1:12:48] amalekites had invaded the South and
[1:12:52] ziklag and Smitt and z lag and burned it
[1:12:54] with fire and had taken the woman
[1:12:57] captives that they that they're therein
[1:13:00] they SL not any either great or small
[1:13:04] but carried them away and went on their
[1:13:06] way verse three so David and his men
[1:13:09] come to the city and behold it was
[1:13:12] burned with fire and their wives and
[1:13:14] their sons and their daughters were
[1:13:16] taken captive then David and the people
[1:13:19] that were with him lifted up their voice
[1:13:21] and wept until they had no more power to
[1:13:25] weep what a condition see they come back
[1:13:28] from Battle and realize that their cap
[1:13:31] has been invaded the enemy has taken
[1:13:33] their people captive the woman the
[1:13:36] children and David now is on the hot
[1:13:38] seat he's on a hot seat now no doubt
[1:13:42] David and his men felt like failures
[1:13:45] because they were the Shepherds to watch
[1:13:46] over those
[1:13:48] people now it goes on to
[1:13:50] say in verse 5 and David to David's two
[1:13:54] wives were taken captive the aino the
[1:13:57] jelit and Abigail the wife of nabal the
[1:14:00] Carmelite and David was greatly
[1:14:03] distressed for the people spake of
[1:14:05] stoning him because the soul of the
[1:14:07] people were grieved every man for his
[1:14:10] sons and for his daughters but David
[1:14:13] encouraged himself in the Lord his God
[1:14:16] oh praise the Lord Church you ever want
[1:14:19] to confuse the enemy encourage yourself
[1:14:22] encourage with the word of God you see
[1:14:26] praise the Lord now the way to encourage
[1:14:29] yourself is to REM remember what God has
[1:14:31] done for you when you remember what God
[1:14:34] has done for you you'll realize he can
[1:14:35] do it again and again and again because
[1:14:38] he's the same yesterday today and
[1:14:40] forever you see the children of Israel
[1:14:44] I'm reminded were compassed around the
[1:14:46] same Mountain for 40 years but they were
[1:14:49] only about 40 days away from the
[1:14:51] promised land see they felt to remind
[1:14:54] themselves of what God had already done
[1:14:56] they couldn't encourage themselves in
[1:14:57] the
[1:14:59] Lord praise
[1:15:01] God verse 7 says and David said to abur
[1:15:05] the priest ahc son I pray thee bring me
[1:15:09] hither the epod and abur brought thither
[1:15:12] the epod to David and David inquired at
[1:15:15] the Lord saying shall I pursue after
[1:15:18] this troop shall I overtake them in
[1:15:21] other words David is saying shall I go
[1:15:24] on the offensive side for a moment see I
[1:15:27] know I fell defensively cuz I shouldn't
[1:15:30] have not even allowed my my people to be
[1:15:32] taken captive but can I go on the
[1:15:34] offensive
[1:15:36] side and the scripture goes on to
[1:15:40] say shall I overtake them and he
[1:15:43] answered them pursue for Thou shalt
[1:15:46] surely overtake them and without fail
[1:15:49] recover all full restoration that's
[1:15:52] right now if you have that this morning
[1:15:56] I say claim it because it belongs to you
[1:15:59] is that right there's some things that
[1:16:02] you're going to have to speak to life
[1:16:03] this season Church don't retreat pursue
[1:16:07] you see that's what was given David was
[1:16:09] given the authority to pursue to take
[1:16:12] back everything the enemy has taken from
[1:16:14] him is that right I encourage you Church
[1:16:17] Pursuit praise the
[1:16:20] Lord the prophet says in the seran
[1:16:23] Church age says now comes our Triumph
[1:16:26] Capstone on the baptism of the Holy
[1:16:29] Ghost Galatians 4:4 through 7 but when
[1:16:32] the fullness of time was come God sent
[1:16:34] forth his son made of a woman made under
[1:16:37] the law to redeem them that were under
[1:16:40] the law that he might receive the
[1:16:42] adoption of sons and because ye are Sons
[1:16:45] God has sent forth the spirit of his son
[1:16:48] into your hearts crying ABA father now
[1:16:51] the prophet goes on to say he did not
[1:16:54] make us Sons for we were already Sons
[1:16:56] but he placed us as Sons for as long as
[1:16:59] we were in the world in the flesh we
[1:17:02] could not be recognized as Sons we were
[1:17:04] held captive by the devil but we were
[1:17:07] Sons nonetheless and he hear this and
[1:17:10] because you are Sons God has sent forth
[1:17:12] the spirit of his son into your heart
[1:17:14] whereby you cry father father and it
[1:17:17] goes on to say what is the baptism of
[1:17:19] the Holy Ghost it is the spirit
[1:17:22] baptizing you into the body of Christ it
[1:17:24] is the new birth it is the spirit of God
[1:17:27] coming in and filling you after you have
[1:17:30] repented having heard this word and
[1:17:32] baptize you in water as an answer of a
[1:17:34] good conscience towards God praise the
[1:17:38] Lord now when you are redeemed son and
[1:17:41] daughter of God you won't live any kind
[1:17:43] of way you'll be convicted when you're
[1:17:46] alone you'll be convicted even when
[1:17:48] you're in public because there is a a a
[1:17:52] expectation
[1:17:53] in a a calling in your life to represent
[1:17:56] God in every manner in every aspect is
[1:17:59] that right you know
[1:18:02] Eve when she ate of the
[1:18:05] fruit if we could just go in the
[1:18:08] beginning for a moment she gave to Adam
[1:18:11] and he also ate and God came on the
[1:18:15] scene I want you to notice that God
[1:18:17] didn't restore them to no fruits God
[1:18:19] started the process of restoration with
[1:18:21] seeds he said I will put enmity between
[1:18:25] thee and the woman and between thy seed
[1:18:29] and her seed he started the process of
[1:18:32] restoration with seeds so church I think
[1:18:35] it's time to identify with the true seed
[1:18:37] of God is that right because if that
[1:18:39] seed is in you right the prophet says a

[1:18:57] Satan can impersonate God in every way
[1:18:59] the one thing he can impersonate God is
[1:19:01] the spoken word he cannot impersonate
[1:19:04] the spoken word because the spoken word
[1:19:06] speaks life and that's the authority
[1:19:08] you've been given that's the power you
[1:19:11] have over the devil it's to speak to it
[1:19:13] and it must
[1:19:14] obey church I say speak this afternoon
[1:19:18] praise the Lord
[1:19:21] hallu the Prophet says in the per pergan
[1:19:24] Church age he says those in the bride do
[1:19:28] only his will no one can make them do
[1:19:31] otherwise they have thus sayith the Lord
[1:19:33] or they keep still which means even when
[1:19:36] you don't understand it you will not be
[1:19:39] deceived they know that it is the it has
[1:19:43] to be God in them doing the works
[1:19:45] fulfilling his own word he did not
[1:19:48] complete all his work while in his
[1:19:49] Earthly Ministry so now he works in and
[1:19:52] through his bride she knows that for it
[1:19:55] was not yet time for him to do certain
[1:19:58] things that he must now do but he will
[1:20:02] now fulfill through the bride that work
[1:20:04] which he left for this specific time
[1:20:08] praise the Lord you have been called for
[1:20:10] this specific time to be one with Christ
[1:20:13] Jesus to do the very work of his
[1:20:16] ministry to resemble his word and to be

[1:23:00] Jacob for for this is my Covenant when I

[1:23:08] concerning the gospel which was blind
[1:23:11] that blinded Israel for the elect's sake
[1:23:15] verse 2 28 says as concerning the gospel
[1:23:18] they are enemies for your sake but as
[1:23:20] touching the election they are beloved
[1:23:22] for the father's sake for gifts and
