overcome by the word of our testimony a man god bless brother yes please come right on amen god bless you it's an honor and a privilege to be in the house of the Lord I'm just so thankful just to be here and I'm thankful for the mighty hands of God's protection on our lives even though even though when we don't know we need to be protected he's still there and this was such a event for me on yesterday I was going down okay okay you know Okeechobee Okeechobee and I was driving it was at night and I was going to make a left-hand turn into the home depot complex Plaza shopping center and so at that left hand cut away off the Okeechobee Road there's no light there and it was dark and so you have to try to measure the correct time you to get across and that so that I think this may have been first I don't know if it was the first or not oh but whatever reason this particular event I thought I had gauged it pretty good right I thought I had to look like a head of cat so in its three lanes and so I'm going into so I just pull in into the first lane and then you got another one in another the middle and over and so by the time I was going into the middle lane I looked really quickly and I saw I mean a car a truck actually a truck or without pulling a trailer I was probably no more than 20 feet from me passing going down the road and I had to slam on my brakes and he blew his horn and I'm slamming on my brakes and I'm like that was a very close call however mind you I'm in the middle of the road now stopped so you're that gauging part did you thinking you're right the cars are still coming so I'm sitting here in the middle of the road waiting for the truck to pass in this trailer and then as soon as it got through passed then I was like I need to get across this road really quick because these cars are coming so I pressed up huh gasps really hard and shot into the into the parking into the parking drive way for the shopping center I was so shook up just to think that I couldn't be standing here tonight it was just that close and just that dangerous and so I was just thinking the Lord and praising him for that protection the angels there once again and I didn't know that I was gonna need it at that moment but I needed it and he allowed me to get across safely and stand here tonight just to be a witness of what he's done and what he continues to do in our lives every day and so I'm so just thankful yet for him I was so shook up even when I got home I was nervous to even Drive and I got home I just had to lay down because my nerves was just really really antsy but I think God that my mind was clear in the midst of that to allow no allow that truck to go and then to clearly say ok get across into the drive and not just panicking well should I back up should I go you know it was just clear straight thought get over get in so it's just that peace that he brings in the midst of a confused situation he allows us to think clearly to get out of danger as it approaches so I just give God all the praise and the honor for what he continues to do for us each and every day some things we know about there's dangers that he protects us from we don't even know we don't know now but we will know one day and God bless you amen amen amen how many know he's our ever-present help in the time of trouble amen amen amen I tell you what we just thinking praising we have something to praise in for a man even the small things will think small it means just like the brothers say the things that we don't even know about a man let alone the things that we know about a man all of us can say he woke us up this morning started us on our way clothed in our right mind a man gave us a mind and a will to be in the house of the Lord one more time but it's those things we are not even aware of a man the danger that was lurking around the corner that we had no idea Amen that the angels were encamped around us that just protect us Amen you know you did the Satan has been trying to kill that seed since the beginning and that's what it is he's trying to destroy that seed amen amen but he can't he can't do it will remain victorious Amen sister you had something amen no okay no no I thought I saw you can't DUP don't be shy amen amen we're gonna try this song here sister bird please okay yes come on and give God glory there amen amen we're here to put our licks afar together amen amen well I do have a praise thank God for bringing me through the week something got a hold of me this week it really gave me a ride really gave me a ride but thank God I made it through him on the other side I think but this is I just want to share it and ask you all to be praying for this particular family yesterday I was sitting in my room and working on the computer and I begin to hear voices outside my window that still had the blinds closed so I thought my it might have been my son talking on the phone with somebody so the voices kept getting louder so I said better look I didn't see let's go out here and I looked out and it was just people everywhere people were everywhere along the banks of the river somewhere in the yard I look very close to my window and when I did and then I saw emergency vehicles lining the street just big trucks every everything cops everywhere oh my god what is going on out there so I threw something my own and stepped out and when I stepped out the front door I saw you the more people more vehicles and what have you so I caught my neighbors eye as I said what's going on and she said that they found the body in that water next to the house and it was just a scene they were treating it as a crime scene because they didn't know what it was about but apparently the man who died he was staying with his nephew a few houses down from the back of us and he had dementia Alzheimer's and he had walked away they were have been looking for him there was a missing-persons report out on him and the nephew he decided to just kind of walk along the canal and he walked and got down there back where I live and he found his uncle's body there so it was a it was a big scene they would have for quite a while they roped off my yard I couldn't get past the front door yes they were trying to keep the crowds back so that all of the news media and everything could come in and and just keep everybody away but there were it was just something to destruct my heart and it was so sad in all the years that we've lived I've never known anything like that to happen so just asked if you all be praying for that family I I don't the man's name was Earl Washington 89 years old because it was on Palm Beach Post website be praying for that family because that's a very sad thing if he walked on that sea his uncle's body him just a very sad thing okay a man was certainly a man keep that Washington family in prayer amen so many times you know we used to growing up right there that we spent all kind of time near that water we used to play in that water and swam we used to do contests we can swim from one side to the other and it's when I realized that fresh water is not the same as the beach that water will pull you down it's the buoyancy is a lot different it's a lot more difficult to swim in fresh water than it is saltwater so and then any man in his and its up an age like that and dementia probably didn't know you know and so with this definitely some really sad situation keep that family lifted up in prayer my heart really goes out it's not something that I would want to have to experience a man so it may let us stand to our feet as we go before the con day anymore prayer requests that we'd like to pray over please I don't think we have any written let it open so I'm at a reasonably and I think we all have a prayer that just draw a little closer to him he ran a man so a man most gracious Heavenly Father Lord car we just come before you lord god Lord car we heard the

the Lord to be here a man once again on tonight wanted to just have word of Prayer I heard brother Collins there in Jeffersonville passed away he used to be the pastor at random Tabernacle but they went through some changes brother Joseph has now passed of a brand of tabernacle and brother Collins had another church that he started I believe his wife passed away last year and now he just passed away about two o'clock today so we want to remember that family and prayer and just trust that God would just even direct the church there that he was leading a man as well so we'll remember that in prayer this the other announcements Sunday don't forget we'll have a pinnacle palms at 5:30 and also the combined service a man amongst the churches that'll be happening in Boynton Beach at 6:30 on 70s so keep that in mind before we just entered to the word tonight let's let's pray over this request father we would come before year your awesome presence God a church is in need of families in need a loved one has gone home we thank you Lord for the life of services brother Collins now God you've called him to his rest and we pray God that you would give strength to this family as they come together and so much has happened over the years and we just pray that you bring a repair renewing and refreshing amongst those loved ones and father we also pray that you would strengthen that church God they only only only you can carry them through give them direction Lord to show and follow what their next sar and just pray to to raise up the right leader right there in the midst that they'll be able to kind of go forward father we just trust that you would just be in the middle of all of this and we know God that you're able to turn our mourning into dancing so we pray that you do just that we ask God that as we enter into the word tonight that you would dismiss it to our hearts and to our knees may you give a strength through your word in Jesus name we pray amen amen god bless you thank you musicians thank you brother Troy and man we appreciate you on tonight amen praise the Lord a man I want to just read a scripture here at a Matthew 14 and I won't we'll just take a little thought here tonight a man and and our thought is just on fear not a man fear not we just trust that the Lord have just helped us through that but here in Matthew 14 starting at verse 14 is that right actually you know what I think I wrote that down right wrong it should be Matthew 14 and starting at verse 22 man verse 22 and it says straightway Jesus constrained his disciples to get into a ship and to go before him and to the other side while he sent the multitudes away and when he had sent the multitudes away he went up into the mountain apart to pray when the evening was come he was there alone but the ship was now in the midst of the sea tossed with waves for the wind was contrary and then the fourth watch of the night Jesus went unto them walking on the sea and when the disciples saw him welcome to sea they were troubled saying it is a spirit and they cried out for fear but straightway Jesus spake unto them saying be of good cheer it is I be not afraid and Peter answered him and said lord if it be thou bit me coming to the underwater and he said come and when Peter was come down out of the ship he walked on the water to go to Jesus and when he saw the wind boisterous he was afraid and beginning to sink he cried saying lord save me and immediately Jesus stretched forth his hand and caught him and said unto Him o thou of little faith wherefore didst thou doubt and when they were come into the ship the wind ceased and then they that were in the ship came and worshiped him saying of a truth thou art the Son of God amen the Lord had a blessing to the reading of his word amen again we want to just talk them the subject of fear not a man you can be seated tonight my man just kind of start this off a man with this quote out of the message Jehovah Jireh part three the Prophet makes a statement it says today people are something on the order like they was in the days when the disciples was out on the ocean it says one night a storm come up and there wasn't nothing all hopes was going that they ever be saved and they seen him come walking on the water now the ship was waterlogged the sails was broke the oars was gone so now brother Branham has given us a deeper description of what was going on you know and and and sometimes when we get the description right we begin to get a little bit sympathetic with with the fear that these brothers are actually experiencing often times when we hear a doctor's report a man and we see the you know just what's written down it's very easy for us to take on a man a spirit of fear right it's very easy because we're looking at all this information and you know so fears it's easy it just it just it comes and attacks you you know once we have some time too much information is not good right you know because it just produces you know a certain fear and so here brother branham just begins to kind of give us a little bit more clarity to say the was waterlogged it's full of water sales broke sales was broke and because they're orang I mean out there rolling in in such conditions the ores are now gone all right and it goes on to say to say they were holding one another can you imagine the disciples inside the boat holding each other fear right fear causes them to kind of do this they they look like they feel like they're in a hopeless situation but here you know they had a commandment from the Lord Jesus to just go to you know just going over to the other side so here arm you know here they're holding each other and not only that brother branham say there - screaming oh what a picture they're holding one another screaming and they look out there and they seen him come walking on the water and we're scared of him their only hope and they were afraid of the only thing that could save them right if that ain't the picture today again they thought it looks spooky you know they said they cried out for fear it was it was a spirit it looked it looked like spiritual that's the same thing in this day but if you if you just do like they did when they cried out they heard that voice coming here not it is I be not afraid be of good courage and if you'll just watch the word of promise for this day you'll hear that same voice speaking through the word he may not come walk into you a man on physical water because you're not there in the ship but he'll come walk him on the water of the words hallelujah he'll come walking on the water the word he say he said that you'll hear the same voice speaking through the word it's me I promise to do this in the last days fear not don't be scared put your trust in me the Son of God who is believe it now you know as the profit just kind of bringing that there and that in that sermon Jehovah Jireh you know I went back and I looked at the definition you know a fear we say fear not fear not and when we look at it one of the definitions that fear gives up you know that that's defined therefore the word fear it's anxiety caused by an expectation of evil anxiety that's caused by an expectation of evil right so so when a person is fearing they actually are expecting evil they're actually expecting of negative results they're actually expecting a man something bad to occur oh my god right I mean you know our faith in God's Word actually it is expecting God to to fulfill his promise hey man if you read what God said whatever he said to you whatever condition you're in if you read that and you grab a hold of our faith they're not then you begin to expect God to do exactly what he said it's going to do and like that the expectations of faith changes your outlook it changes your attitude it changes your approach but when you have fear ain't man there's an expectation that something evil about to happen you know I've seen you know I know different people you know there was a lady that you know we we knew she had developed a conditioner body I think it was cancer something like that that lady began to make preparation for you know her death she began to get everything in order she just knew that you know that she was gonna die real soon and you know within within months that lady was gone I mean her expectation was that she was gonna die with him much she was going right I've seen other people that applied faith and they they would fight cancer to the end right I mean they didn't fight for years with cancer right but but you know it just shows that when you apply faith is a result then when you actually operate in fear fear is an expectation of evil an expectation of a bad outcome you actually expected that remember we had our brother what's it brother gassing yeah you know but he been here a couple times man I need to get him here again he was on the video I mean yeah the video that we saw the other day a PowerPoint but he was talking about how he used to fear the deer so he would drive home at night and and you know and he would always when he's in his car he's always like you know Lord I don't want to hit a deer lord I don't want to hit a deer Lord I don't want to hear it hit a deer you know and and as as he's he's you know riding home at night thinking that way every time you think that way a deer just pop up out of nowhere and Wham he hits the deer Tampa's calm everything and he just noticed that it was always because he had a certain amount of fear of hitting the deer that the deer was show up and when he began to change his attitude about that I know hitting oh dear ain't no deer gonna come out here front of my car when they begin to change his attitude he wasn't hitting no more deers but but his fear actually brought the beer it's his fear to bring a deer what can faith to us tonight glory to God right amen but but fear is an expectation of evil but when we got faith we're expecting we expecting God to do exactly what he said he would do you know there was um I was just reading an article and they were talking about this lady that she had six floors that she would ride up the elevator to get to her apartment and six floors and you know in the middle of the day by about 12 o'clock and as she was riding up the floors they lost power in the building so here she is stuck in the elevator and so the elevator she's in there alone dark no lights and I mean she's in there and this anxiety just begin to kick in and and when it kicked in the first thing she did is just reach her phone and she called her mom just to kind of try to talk to her mom a little bit but some kind of way I guess you know I don't know if - if she didn't get a connection I don't know what happened but uh but for some reason anxiety just kept kicking kept kicking and say by the time they got to the lady she was completely unconscious I think they got to in 30 minutes and by the time they got to her she was completely unconscious from being in that elevator for 30 minutes right she was gone and and they got it to the hospital and within hours the lady was dead young lady gone and and they were saying that you know from the surface it looked like she died from just being a freak right just that that was the things you're just afraid i'ma tell you glory to God as believers when we get ourselves of some touch tough situations there's a lot of things we can do one of them is you know start quoting scripture quoting scripture first thing coming in mind just start coding scripture another thing if you ain't got you can't remember scripture gotta give you a song and you just begin to sing that song and and as you get under the North turn that song I mean all of a sudden you you forget about what's around you you ready to shout you ready to praise God because it brings an anointing you actually begin to drive fear back hallelujah you drive fear back with your actions Loree their God amen there's another little something that I found on the internet a man and I want to just read it to you here before we go further there was the question was how fear can affect your body how fear can affect your body says the body's first and natural reaction to feelings of fear is to fight or flight right you see the fight-or-flight response right and this is often characterized by certain changes in muscle hormones that prepares the body either to face the source of fear to make a hasty escape you know the body is designed to exhibit the fight-or-flight response only when legitimate sources of fear are present whether it's a robber and a dark alleyway waving a knife in your face or a monstrous truck barreling down on you as you cross the street there are physical changes that happen the moment a source of fear appears the lungs expand so more oxygen is made available to the bloodstream the pupils dilate you know your eyes just get pink right the pupils dilate so that you can see more and circulation to other systems of the body are temporarily shunted so the majority of the blood flow is directed to the brain so you can think better right listen says your blood pressure also Rises and the liver starts releasing more sugar in order to prepare the body for action the body also produces cortisol the hormone that is released in response to stress and plays a role in the production of blood sugar however our bodies are not designed to stay in this constant state of fear for weeks and years if it stays on edge for days own in the body can and will eventually shut down fear will take a person out of here oh my god that's why Jesus say the word fear not don't let the devil anoint you with fear you gotta fight that with everything you got glory to God listener says it says if it stays on that row for days on end the body can and will eventually shut down this is because increased blood pressure rapid heart rates and high levels of cortisol can destroy the organs when they persist for long periods in I remember you know when we went to the doctor there and what a doctor gave us such a bad report when Sara was being born my wife was carrying her and the doctor just gave us such a bad report and you know that hey you you got it's a probability it's gonna be this its probability gonna be that and you know you over this threshold and you know all kind of stuff that they you know they just start pointing out to us but we walked in that doctor's office with just such a calmness and we come to the conclusion that you know what whatever it is we're gonna accept it right whatever whatever God got for us we're gonna accept it because you know that's that's God's plan that's not our plan and when we sat down and we talked to that doctor and he was just you know just giving us all the negative things like doc it doesn't matter we don't we're not gonna do the test that y'all wants to do we're gonna just stand on God's Word and we're just gonna believe God whatever he gives us we're gonna accept whatever whatever it is that's just intuitive but we walked out it was such a feast we refuse to leave there with fear we refuse to walk out that doctor's office with fear and just you know what they said this they said yeah they said that but the Word of God say something different amen and and I tell you what if we were to lived in that fear we probably it probably caused my wife to carry her differently and the fear that was that would have been upon my wife would have affected the child right but but having that peace that passeth all understanding that actually changes the whole situation Oh glory to God when Jesus say don't fear that that's exactly what it means don't don't fear whatever you do whatever you do don't fear another thing here that I just want to make mention of expectation its message expectation the Prophet says this just like I was telling the lady this morning when you go to fry your meat for breakfast and a big bunch of grease pops up on your hand the first thing it just scares you to death you grab your hand where is the unguent team right just as quick as you can that's the reason it burns you that's what that's that's what makes it the scare is what I can prove that it's the scare that burns you we don't know who we are yet you know I mean I'm glad that God sent a prophet to share these days because I don't know you know sue something like that happened you just you know you you wrap it and you know do this and do but you know we got the same power and authority in us that Paul had in him when that snake bit him on the hand he shook it off and kept going we got that even right I mean that that's it's fear that actually brings the burn it's fear that you know if we can just probably go back and look at all the scars that we got on our body fear brought them scars right fear did these things glory to God hallelujah when when when we can weaken when we can conquer fear and there's been many times you know I just listen there to brother Quentin testimony that was fear being conquer right there in the middle here this this just this truck is right on you and you're just looking at them they're looking at you everybody blowing homes but God give you peace and somehow I'm gonna bring you out of this don't worry I'm with you I'm with you you know I'll retie finished reading that a little bit you know I was thinking to myself just when I had the accident some years ago me and brother smiling when the car and and I remember and we were on our way to church on the went on that Friday night and and as the car was coming we're going and we got t-boned you know as we're going this way that car was coming this way and and hit right on the passenger side right in the door and and as a car was approaching I could see what was getting ready to happen brother smiley could see it was like Jack I'm like well just it's gonna be all right we're gonna be all right just to kind of brace yourself right and we were just kind of talking and and you know just I mean not not screaming and you know yelling like oh it's something that come over you right and I'm a reader quote here in a second but it's it when when when God has given you the ability to overcome fear it's something that just kind of comes over here there's a piece that you get that you can't explain right but uh you know and I was I was I was Justin are brothers come you know we're gonna it's gonna be alright you know just I see it we can't really stop it is getting ready to hit let's just brace yourself and you know as we sitting there in the car I mean hit just turns us over on on top and we slide down the street you know on the owner on a hood and and it finally come to a stop you know we hit a curb and the car come to a stop and I'm sitting over looking at him and and I'm trying to find it like you all right brother you all right and I'm turning the car because I'm still thinking in my head man this car gonna blow so let me turn this car off how you know you processing like that you know and you just got hit by a car right under you but this car you ready blow up let me turn this thing off and this is all the things that's going through my mind right so you know when we brother smiling you know I'm turning the action see you all right now don't see brothers finally I see his feet and he's a big guy you know I see his feet going out through that that that's that side window and I say okay if I took that seat belt off and I went riding out the side go right along with him I jumped out and said man you all right yeah I'm all right and folk come running up to us and you know they're just looking like and even the guy that with that drove the car he was so drunk and you know he looking like he can't believe people walked out of the thing alive is anybody else in the car no it's just us two y'all sure y'all all right yeah we fine walking around nothing nothing you know nothing seemed wrong just to look bleed them on one pinky and he bleeding on his other pinkies or that that's really that was it and and when I when I go back and I think about that is because you know hat we've probably had a spirit of fear it would have been something totally different but but but God got a way of just kind of stepping in there and taking fear away from you right because he realizes Amen how you know how dangerous fear is Oh glory to God let's keep on reading in this quote the Prophet says I can prove to use to scare that burns you you got the Holy Ghost its operating in your body well when that old snake grabbed a hold of Paul hands there was there was not a bit of scare not not one ounce not one ounce of fear in Paul he looked at it like that shook it off in the fire and went on and got some more it didn't scare him see if you're if you're not scared Jesus said why did you fear Peter come walking on the water doing fine until he's seen the waves were contrary and I don't know what might be contrary in your life but don't look at whatever's contrary look at what the Word of God says right you you just no matter no matter what the waves are you stay with the word God gonna bring you through somehow if you gotta come walking through your situation he'll come walking through it but he gonna bring you out somehow just whatever you do just don't fear listen listen he says this Peter come walking he says Jesus said why don't you fear Peter come walking on the water doing fine until he's seen the ways were contrary then he got scared and began to sing Jesus come pick them up said why did you fear oh ye of little faith fear you're scared it won't happen don't have one bit of fear move forward God said so and that settles it I'm convinced that fear is something that's crippling us and stopping us from experiencing everything that God has for us we have to we have to be able to step up into this next level that God's called us to no fear no fear God made a promise to him God's gonna keep his promise it's not up for us to try to figure out how it's going to happen and you know the devil guy that's just worried straight right you know okay it's come - I made a statement one time you know now we're preaching up there in South Carolina I told people I say you know God changes his strategies as to how he how he meets your needs sometimes you might put a check in the mail but you don't go looking through it looking for the check in the mail every day or every time you got a need I'm like I'm expecting God to put another check in event God will change his strategy on you don't limit God to your mailbox right you could go to the grocery store somebody might put something in your hand that didn't come in the mail right but sometimes we you know God make away one way and we just limit God that this only way Kaka don't don't ever do that don't ever do that go to God God might drop something in your PayPal account you don't know how God gonna meet your knees glory to God hallelujah right but you know oftentimes we limit ourselves you know when God does something like that and we what we want to do like no no no whatever the need is whatever the thing that's going contrary to where I am right now I'm not going to doubt I'm just gonna I'm gonna take God it is where he said he'll rebuke the Devourer for my sake how he do it that's up to him glory to God for the random you know makes this statement here and you know I Oh Lord I got there's there's a lot here a lot here let me let's just you know if we we look at that that scripture that we were reading there when they were when Jesus had told them to get into the ship and go to the other side he had just finished feeding the 5,000 and sending the 5,000 away they had already saw a miracle that day they saw a miracle and unfortunately church we've we've seen miracles some of us have been miracles but yet fear will creep up on us and we find ourselves doubting whether God can do it again I'm here tonight and say the devil is a liar and not only can my god do it again he will he will do it again he gone you're gonna keep doing it over and over and over I mean I you know y'all might think I'm crazy but man I some time I just I have to I have to talk back to the devil they put some things in my hands you know and and I and I got this from you know what's the name of that gentleman I preached about open open wide that mouth that I may fill it George Mueller thank you he you know George Mueller made a statement he Street odo saying if God tell me this time it's gonna be the first time if he failed me this time it's gonna be the first time he found me right and when I when I heard that I said that's what I'm used to telling us that Satan if he failed me this month it's gonna be the first month now i'ma tell you the way my god is undefeated God's right here he ain't gonna have not one loss on his record not one not to you not to the devil right so so I always I just remind him see if he felt me this time it's gonna be the first time he ever fell me and I don't think he won't he'll want to have that kind of testimony so we don't sit back and watch him make away right so I mean I just I just stopped talking to the devil and you know and then when I see God make away I you know someone's like I call him up hey you remember what you said that God wanna do I told you is gonna be the first time he didn't do it this time either he did not fail right see fear fear fear will cause us to bring all the evil results but faith faith will bring us promises to pass fear not fear not whatever you do don't don't don't fear don't fear I got a lot of quotes here to read and I'm not gonna read them all tonight I just get you enough to get you going but but really what my thought is here I'm gonna be taking different portions of Scripture and and just bringing out the stories just to drive the spirit of fear out because everybody's had to deal with it all right we can go right through the scripture and show you different ones that was fearing you are we've talked recently about the the woman in 1st Kings 17 where the God told the Prophet said go down to this widows woman go down her house I have I have ordained her to sustain thee through this family that lady didn't have no food that lady was down to her last and here the Prophet go into a house and you know and when it when he acts for water you know brother Branham said she had no problem give him the water she like man you know I'm thirsty he thirst my son thirst we got enough water we can share that so she wouldn't get the water for the profit but soon as I said and if you don't mind just baked me a cake first that's what she she she start piping up and she said now you know what all I got is this last look cake this last little meal and I'm gonna I'm gonna feed myself I'm my son to myself and we're gonna die the expectation was death after this last meal we are weird we're gonna die that's it and and what what changed the whole situation the profit actually told her double fear fear not that's what he told in verse 13 the first King 17 say don't you know whatever you do just just don't fear go ahead and do exactly what you say you're gonna do but as you baking that cake for your son make sure you bake me one first oh my god can I tell y'all you know put God first no matter what you're going through Satan coming against your finances put God first just do what God actually that's all he asks you to do that just put him first I can assure you that if you put God first your crews will not go empty and your barrel will not run dry if you put God first hallelujah but she was told fear not and when she was told fear not she heard thus sayeth the Lord and just those dos DOS thus sayeth the Lord those four words change the whole outlook cuz she knew that she had something solid guess what we might not have anybody walk up to us and say thus saith the lord but if we can read it in his word we got thus saith the lord when she heard fear not because fear was giving ready to bring her to death fear was about to her and bring her to death but when he when he come walking in with the promise from Almighty God in church I'd say well God will always come walking in with a promise give you something in the word he gives you something take that run with it dry the devil back don't fear this last code I read for you tonight out of God's covenant with Abraham and his seed brother Branham makes a statement here says you son get no doubt at all great old song of the church certainly all fear is done go Jesus constantly fear not fear not he says I am he that was dead and alive forevermore fear not says I am with the always to the end of the world fear not it says and and the Christian keeps sitting back oh I just wonder and that's that's the thing that we always wonder whether God gonna do this whether God gonna do that no if he said he gonna do it then he gonna do it it says it says oh I just wonder oh my turn loose a man get all the things away from you say mr. Satan you are defeated Jesus Christ strip you of your every power you had when he died at Calvary you're nothing but a bluff and I like I like this what he says here he says and you can't Bluff me you're nothing but a bluff and you can't Bluff me he says hey man I'm made out of stuff that don't Bluff I said oh brother walking us luck when right from right from the message and preached it to us I made out of stuff that don't Bluff ain't got a lot of devil to bluff me whatever the devil sent us a lie and whoever he used it to speak through they lie I'm gonna take God's Word Bible say whose report you gonna believe I'm gonna believe the report of the Lord he says I'm made out of stuff that don't Bluff that's what that's what come from Calvary hallelujah don't Bluff go receive it so just step aside I'm moving on for Christ amen you can see the red I go over the hill where he left a man that's right God would take care of his own and all things work together for good to them that love him he moves on whatever you whatever you do don't fear don't fear when the things get boisterous get contrary don't fear hold to God's unchanging hey let's pray yes pray dear God we are encouraged of strengthen Lord by your word many of us tonight going through various things but we know God that if we could just hold to your promise then Lord that thing that thing that we're going through it'll it'll it'll pass like like the the saying this to shell has whatever it is fear cripples us fear hinders us God that's why you had to always tell people fear not fear not don't don't please don't operate that way take faith in an honor my word and and and just just know that as you out of my word I'm gonna also honor it so help us Lord to only believe that's that's our s our desire Lord there are many we got tonight just going through even some Lord that might not have been able to make the service tonight because of things that they're going through Lord my prayer is that the people get a revelation that they do not have to fear whether it's a financial issue whether it's a physical issue whether it's an emotional issue a mental issue god we do not have to fear when we're standing in a gap believing for our loved ones no matter what we hear we don't have to fear Bible tells us that we know that all things are working together for good to them that love God to them who are the called according to his purpose so since we know these things we do not need to fear so help us God to stand and faith and as Paul said what having done all to stand will stand therefore let that be our testimony God miss our shaking off everything that Satan is using to come against us we shake it off we stand firmly on your word God and Jesus thing we pray amen amen fear is gone [Music] because I know oh he holds my future my life is worth the living just because he lives come on sing with all your heart because he I can face tomorrow because he lives oh oh fear is gone because I know he owes my future Oh [Music] life is worth the living just because she lives let's take it one more time because see I can face too the chilli all fear is gone because I know [Music] behold my future and life is worth the living just because he lives let's give the Lord a hand the phrase tonight glory to his name thank you Jesus thank you Jesus father we just thank you for the privilege and the opportunity to be able to gather here in your presence Lord just the testimonials that went forth and the prayer requests Lord will continue to remember and father our prayer is that you have just continued to give us strength Lord to keep pressing through whatever it is that we have to press through God to give us power to overcome we pray your blessings upon the saints that were able to make it those that were not able to make it oh God give them strength Lord and trust that you'll continue to encouraged each and every heart touch those that are not feeling well in their body statement attacking so many father here in the congregation but we pray your blessings that you it touch lordship people that you got would just get all the glory that and the honor a man from bringing us true Lord God the things that we're facing pray to chew it keep us till we're able to come back again on Sunday morning and may you Lord just watch over us protect us Jesus name we pray amen a man the brothers will come at this time to dismiss you a man and also I didn't want to just take a moment and tell everyone thank you for the everything that happened on Sunday just a 15 year anniversary of the celebration it's the ministry appreciation amen we really really both sus Tareq and I really appreciate it that the cars that we receive just the words and just so much that so much love was just given to us so we're so grateful for you also I've God bless you amen and thank you so much brothers will come at this time to dismiss you
