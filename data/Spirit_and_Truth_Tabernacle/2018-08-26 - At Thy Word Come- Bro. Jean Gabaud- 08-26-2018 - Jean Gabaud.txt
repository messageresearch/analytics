man - because he lives a man for brother Jean we're so grateful to have him here I got in I left this morning DC about went headed to the airport about three o'clock in the morning and I got on a flight about 5:30 just to try to get here and I want to thank dolefully brother Quinton stepping in and taking care of a Sunday spoon of that brushing a masterly appreciate that and I was so glad to

a man everybody [Music] about everybody in place are you yes amen amen you love the Lord this morning amen you may just have a seat for a moment amen greet you all in the name of the Lord Jesus is certainly good to be back in the house of the Lord amen just appreciate all your prayers and you know just to kind of elaborate on what brother Jack was kind of explaining I know a few of you has been asking you know about my mom and so things kind of rapidly transpired the last few weeks and I was explained to brother Jack Duff that the last three years has been trying and but you know you always uh you always remain faithful you've known in a you know in the God that you worship and you believe in so you know my mom's been you know you know been a battling condition with kidneys and um and so she's been on dialysis for quite some time and you know here shortly she started to get into a weakened state and just really in our body she starts to get really weak and so the doctors were saying that things didn't look too good so the doctors say that things didn't look too good and that um and that are they you know she may no longer be a candidate for dialysis treatment and so you know she stopped eating and she got really weak in the body and just really frail so they took our dialysis and they you know put her into a hospice so I'm thinking that you know we had several weeks to kind of make arrangements you know make preparations and things of that nature and but but it you know her health quickly deteriorated so when they put her into Hospice the a couple of days later just within a couple of days she drew her last breath and so you know she's you know she kind of struggle for quite some time and I know she's in a better place and it was a it was three years to the exact month that my father had passed away so it was in the exact same month and it's just been trying because as I was explain to your brother Duff was that you know three years ago was my father that last year was my mother-in-law and then within the last month it was my it was my mother but you know brother Bram said something that's pretty remarkably says you know he says you know if I pray for ten thousand people tonight and ten thousand of them died in the morning he says tomorrow night with the same faith that still preached divine healing it doesn't change who God is it doesn't change in the God that I believe in amen so I'm comforted to know that she's in a better place we still got a struggle she doesn't have to struggle anymore so so there's there's there's there scriptures that I'm encouraged by whenever you know when you go through trials and tribulation so it's just it's just been a whirlwind the last several weeks and how we quickly have to move and work with family so if I just appreciate your support you know the prayers and just always being available for us so just thought I want to expound on that a little bit more I won't keep you too long if you might if you don't mind just standing with me turn with me to Matthew chapter 14 just a little simple thought this morning I'm sure many of you have read it before but thought I just expand on it a little bit I administered on this on a Wednesday night at a home church some time back and I've have appreciate some of the thoughts that some of the nuggets that are kind of embedded within the scripture so I thought I'd just expand on this a little bit amen Matthew chapter 14 say man if you dare Tamara verse 22 Matthew 14 verse 22 and it reads and straightway Jesus constrained his disciples to go into a ship and to go before him unto the other side why he sent the multitudes away and when he had sent the multitudes away he went up into a mountain apart to pray and when they was come he was there alone but the ship was now in the midst of the sea tossed with ways where the wind was contrary and in the fourth watch of the night Jesus went unto them walking on the sea and when the disciples saw him walking on the sea they were troubled saying it is a spirit and they cried out for fear but straightway Jesus spake unto them saying be of good cheer it is I be not afraid compete or insert him and said lord if a beast thou bid me come unto thee on the water and he said come and when Peter was come down out of the ship he walked on the water to go to Jesus but when he saw the wind boisterous he was afraid and beginning to sink he cried saying lord save me and immediately Jesus stretched forth his hand and caught him and said unto Him o thou of little faith wherefore did a style down and when they were come into the ship the wind seized may the Lord had his blessing to the reading of the word you may be seated a very well-known scripture for sure I know that many of you've read it before and are very familiar with that scripture and I've I appreciate that scripture because there's just so many depths in meaning that's that's captured into this portion of scripture that we're going to go into just for a moment of time and we're just gonna really try to our best to kind of labor upon this thought and kind of provide some offshoots some nuggets here and there but you know I find it pretty remarkable because of just how things this begins to unfold and you know I don't believe that these are written in the scripture just by coincidence there's there's a lesson that's embedded in the scripture that God wants us to draw from because he wants to he wants you to know that your situation is not unique and that you know there are others in the scripture that has gone through you know similar journey and paths that you've gone through and how they've come out on the other end is a testament of how God's gonna bring you out on the other end and the the scripture starts with Jesus constrained his disciples to get into the ship and he tells them to go before him not to the other side now he's provided direction for his disciples and he said you go on in this journey and I'll catch up with you and you know sometimes you just got to take God at His Word so if they get on this ship they get on this boat and they make way to go to the other side and in their just trusting that God is they figure it all out because Jesus you know he left and then left without Jesus so he's gonna figure it all out and so he went and we sent the multitudes away and meanwhile why he sent the multitudes away he went into a place that was apart from distraction a place that was apart from disbelief place that was apart from doubt and he begins to pray and he begins to pray as the Sun begins to set and it begins to get into the evening time and in no doubt he's praying for the ones that he just sits on the journey so even as it feels that God is not listening he's always thinking about you he's always he's always have a word of comfort for you so he he's out there and he's he's he's praying alone because he knows that he sent his disciple on a journey and he knows that along the journey that winds are gonna come trials are gonna come tribulations are gonna come and so he wants to make sure that you know that they have protection that that they have guidance and that someone is there that other the very power of God is watching over them so Authority so he begins to pray in his alone in this prayer and as it begins to pray and then this is not one of them quick prayers but this is one of them grow meet role where he's trying to tap into the throne of God it's not just because because he was interested me he was invested in this size in his dollar and so those who you want to make sure that the power having ascended of heaven as sincere as possible to reach the Almighty God he's giving us the demonstration that when you're learning player that you're just not imagining things that you're trying to enter into a place in it's your realm where you come into contact with God if you're looking at me confused you haven't done some good praying because if you're if you're in the moment of desperation where you need God you stay at the foot of the altar until you come into contact with something supernatural because you need something super magic to deal with your natural things and there's an atmosphere that's created that's so different that you lose the sense of time you lose the sense of your sarandí and are you loving the of the almighty and as Jesus begins to pray this ship is now in the midst of the sea now he represents people attitudes in Chinese that's what the body is so you know so here we are in the midst of the world and so we're in the midst of the sea tossed its ways for the wind was contrary and you know what happens is that but you know the sea typically is calm but there are spirits that comes or ways that comes that disturbs the sea and it causes waves to come up you know you were comfortable in this ship yes stability but something's not walking it a little bit and so you're trying to find something to hold on to you in the funny way here starts to rise up together the class right the lightness God made a promise to me this ship is my side turning the Baathists is this the baddest says in another place this is a medievalist come this ship was in the midst of the sea and Jesus was a land and the land and he Jesus so there [Music] Charlie and Larry for the word is contrary unto them you know when life hits your heart if things just seems to shatter into thousands of pieces he's 52 in the battle by yourself the Bible says that Jesus was on the land and a mountain but it is watching in the distance truly he saw them struggling he saw the be persecuted he is keeping an eye on that to make sure that nothing happens to them the journey let me tell you it's the same it's the same got the same message [Music] can we say praise the Lord and the ship was tossed to and fro and no doubt fear started to rise out anymore the thing about it is you know we don't we we have this degree of uncertainty because all we have is just God's words and that's all we got a little too but I will tell you that God's Word is more powerful than any medical instrument God Lord is more powerful than any pharmaceutical manufacturer God by powerful than any counselor on this earth any psychiatrist any psychologist because the bond with this faith is that substance if all I have to hold on to is something I wanna hold on to God's words your bank account will not save you your job will not save you your eloquent speech a good dress none of that was saving when it comes down to when it comes to your salvation but the ship is now in the midst of the sea tossed with ways for the wind was contrary and then the fourth watch of the night when it's all dark and you're in the middle of this shouting and screaming and no one knows no one cares no it's very noisy aware in the midst of effect let me tell you since you got a picture this when you have been the middle of us of an ocean when there's no rights there's no direction under the night sky and you wonder how he's gonna find you let me tell you they had none of the instruments that we have today but he knows exactly where you could be sitting in church and not thinking about God he knows exactly where he could be go through the motions of Christianity but he knows exactly where you're at and he knows exactly where to come and find you not only during the day but in the middle of the night when no one else is around with no one else bushel pains with no one else those are struggles when you can't sleep at night when you twist and turn when you're worried about the next day he knows how to come to your prayer there's no I'll come to your heart he knows how to reach exactly in your moment of distress man's word would always fail to say the right things they wouldn't word from God Saints and in the first watch Jesus went unto them not imagine this he didn't send angels he didn't sent serums he came himself when anybody fell they got back to Jesus they got back to goddesses I mean your children has fallen God what are you gonna do about it program illustration diseases Michael wanted to go down there guy says this is not a job for you Gabriel says I'm raising their penis guy says calm down it's not to you the Bible says he could not repay anyone later so God here by himself he had to come down destinies Allah pulses great is the mystery of godliness for God manifested flesh the Bible says Jesus came walking on water now I want you to just read over things the Bible says he came walking on water now for the disciples this was an urgent situation this was the state of emergency what is God Jesus casually walking on water because God is in control of all things he sees your panic but God still in control he sees the urgent business for you the gods in control he sees how you just nervous but God's in control he seems like you're anxious anxiety your stress level but God's in control because God doesn't just react to your emotions he wants you to know that he's dead control there's no situation too big no problem too difficult no possible situation too impossible that he doesn't come on the scene he just casually comes walking on water who's they they defy every bit of logic every bit of reasoning and he just comes walking the water the Bible says walking on the sea and when the disciples saw him rather than doing backflips and being joyful the Bible says that they thought they saw a ghost and they cried out for fear that is in receiving a supernatural they were fearful of the supernatural it's as if we pray for somebody who's lines that lurk in you just let them see and God does that we're step back is oh my gosh when it happens we don't know how to react to the supernatural because we just let the words become words we let the places become and then when the Sudarsana bring us to a point where the natural where the supernatural becomes natural to us the reason like that's the point is that's how you're going to take a change in the body there's none of these days it's more than just preaching a good gospel that you're gonna change in the body it's moving you responded to an a man that I'm gonna take a change in the body I believe it doesn't happen today I'm looking forward to it tomorrow if it doesn't happen tonight I'm looking for the next day if it doesn't happen this week I'm looking for it next week but it's bound to happen the supernatural should become natural to us Berlin puts it this way he says Peter when he was in the boat the night before or or so forth and the warders was twisting back and forth and Jesus was standing walking on the water he was he was scared of him he thought he was spooky or something sunny saw a ghost and the only thing that could help them to help hug them they were scared of it that's the way it is today with the people that's what's the matter with America tonight the only thing that could save America from Total Annihilation is to recharge you God we baptism of the Holy Ghost that's exactly right and they're scared of it that's right god help us to have a revival about shake the shell the shells off that's what we read today they're scared of the very thing that they need I am not ashamed of this gospel I'm not just a Christian when I'm in church cuz I'm not scared of Who I am out there in the world I'm a Christian in church I'm a Christian outside of church I'm a son of God at work unless son of God when I was in school okay I'm getting a couple of eight minutes in there I want y'all to reflect I will send a God when I'm in traffic and some are cut in front of me it's not always easy but I gotta remember I'm the son of God you just never know got a tension that kind of way years ago number I was going to church on my company off him like nails get ready to tell them something they'll go in the st. church I was going to now Hawkwood out they going to church we stand together oh I'm a son of God I'm a child of God that's who I am that's my makeup that's my language that's my dress that's who I am then my club lips ain't nothin new than making the war feel uncomfortable you may have a business dinner and everybody starts eating your own limbani head Lord Jesus I'm gonna thank you for this food they'll know whether to chew just stop to church just impress people statement that in this generation the worldwide an individual that would declare that God is the line when I don't have an answer I still pray about it I know it's not popular when you sit out there but that's the language that God has put in neither sweet I'll let you just think about that for Oh the diseases coming just you know it's easy to just be comfortable and say brother I love you sister I appreciate you moving in the battlefield by yourself and they're not a deacon around and the pastor's not around and you're in your sisters not around and it's just you God the reason like this is a point that the Hollies drawing close and it's getting darker some of the listed a lot of lines shine as white as they can it needs to be a limit of differentiation it needs to be a limit where there is something that's different between me in the world not what I believe not what I say but it's how I is how I demonstrate is how they see the life of God that's just flowing out of me then we'll need to see you you'll have to preach one word because if that's a child of God wasn't in my notes but I thought I'd drop it in anyhow insanely Jesus spoke this is beautyrx I know this defies the laws of science I know technology can explain this I know the greatest minds don't know what's happening but it is I your Lord and Savior that's walking on water that's doing the impossible I know science can explain it science can explain everything it defines the critical thinking back there so I've seen a man welcome water in Jesus had to appeal to their hearts and say be of good cheer I know this is very supernatural you've never seen this before but it is I so they're looking at the situation that Jesus kind of makes this way and Peter boldly stands up and said lord if it be you did needs to come on to thee on the water and then Jesus didn't preach a long sermon he didn't go on for he didn't start from Genesis and make his way up to where he's at now he just went there [Music] the ability superior to doing that Jesus was doing rested in one word if all you need is yes just one more that's efficient when you're laying in the hospital bed alone in the summer just be one word from God they could make me whole again when I'm depressed Ellen is just one more when I'm confused are these just Network oh Jesus service come Jesus tonight Peter did you believe in the holy cow he can do backflips Kenny speaking Thai he says come I want that to resume because it takes more than a sermon it takes more than keep preaching hey stop word of God the penetrate deeper to the sky of the speed of godith in here that could change your life for Peter to deny everything rested on one word all Jesus said that is the power of God's words but you know what they're meant for Peter and that that he had to leave his comfort he was on the boat the boat was supporting him so he was okay as long as it was in the boat as long as his finances in order he was okay because he's fast someone he could drop from the break from as long as he has a child to go back to you see if this fine as long as the other four okay as well as this half is good this boat okay but just as our forget your finance forget your else forget your job forget your phone step outside of the boat don't require action that's much more than you cinder say amen to say they take action he had to leave his comfort there are those in the boat [Music] no others those on the boat but there was less brave then they are willing to take the Word of God as Peter was and so they kind of retreated towards the badness that you're really going to do this because we see how the waves is kind of situations are kind of scary outside that's what faith is we were in church and pastor preaching really geared you feel real comfortable every by comes and sitting in their assigned seats and we've done so we just aren't comfortable god forbid that's a nice thing yes I see that just throws your whole Sunday off yeah it's happened to me through my life and I will walk them situated one science about was thinner sign C we have to go back and kind of plan our challenge where else are we gonna go stare it messes up the whole Sunday I'm reusing rivers shafted clothes trying to take you out of your comfort zone but only silly typically sit over here tonight when you can get a piece of the world see right here so we could get before no matter where you sit Ricci lives alone Peter had to step outside of his comfort zone and Danny Jesus was he stepped out he wasn't shy rationalizes his soul was resting them with a word come here how deep the water was his faith had been resonated so much he had received such notification that if he could see God doing it himself Danny never tell you to do something that he himself has it done just don't dolly that he hasn't ghost you then you'll get today he hasn't cost you this is that when Israel was battling the Philistines and they're saying well this is because your God is the god of the mountain that's the reason why you have about all the victories and gases then let's bring this battle to the valleys Peter started walking on this water he started walking towards Jesus imagine that st. he was doing the impossible he was doing what no one else was capable of doing he was defined the very laws of science he was defying the philosophers back there the counselors the teachers the mathematicians who say well according to the laws of gravity and all this stuff none of that mattered everything was resting upon one word he tells you come if he tell you he did you to come then he has an obligation to watch over he's committed to his word God is committed to his word because Missy Lord didn't meet accompanies this come blood has an obligation to watch over that word and he walked on water to go to Jesus he didn't have any financial support his 401k his job he left that ship he now had to stand upon faith it's not to say that there's anything bad in that but your faith is resting upon God's words then whatever happens to you in your natural course of life God has you in his hands and Peter put his faith into action and he begins to walk towards Jesus mother and puts it this way he says look at Peter Peter was in trouble looked like he was going to die and he's seen the Lord coming Lord come walking on the water and said lord if that be you bid me to come the Lord said come now if Peter said now wait a minute Lord let me go on and fast for forty days to see if I can walk on water or not Oh Lord let me get enough spirit only that I can dance in the spirit and speaking turns on in this boat that I can step out no sir he took God at his roar let me and let go it's a god and his words can you just imagine that is forsaking your friends the very ones that was in the same boat with you but didn't have enough courage didn't have enough faith to take God at His Word and Foley's want to stay behind you move forward you keep your eyes fixated upon Jesus and Peter started walking towards Jesus let me tell you when God begins to do a work he does a complete work it reminds me of another story this is counted no quick intermission before we wrap it up with Matthew reminds me of another so when Peter was kept in prison because Herod wanted him dead and so he was in prison and there was prayer that was being made of the church forgotten and when Herod had would have brought went forth the same night Peter was sleeping between two soldiers bound with two change and the keepers before the door kept the prison so there was no way out of that situation it seemed impossible and behold the angel of the Lord came upon him and the light shine and the prison and he smoked Peter on the sinuses wake up all rise quickly and his chains fell from off of his hands and the angel said gird thyself and buy five sandals now listen to this God's in control he says put your shoes on and in danger is just waiting because God's not going to start a work and not finish it so the age already knows the outcome but Peter in his situation his father quickly put take you time make sure you put your sandals on in the guard or asleep there's not enough noise that could be made doesn't wake up the guard whine under the nose of the devil God knows how to bring you out of that situation Peter was put on his sandals dangerously tie your shoes make sure it's tied don't forget that one two and things like I'm late guys that men put your pants on put your pants on we're good we're fine that's what the Bible says throw your clothes put you put your clothes on God's in control I want you to I want that too kind of I'm kind of really resonate with you sometimes you're in panic mode but God is in control when you don't know how you gonna pay that bill take control when you don't know how you're gonna respond in that meeting God is in control you don't have it nor feel like the situation the brain God is in control they need to try Peter the dangerous repeater bind his shoes by non-violence I sandals you did cast I've garment about thee put your clothes on in an age of six of time you're ready starting to follow me dangers to say follow me he did it did it didn't know how he was going to get out but he had to trusting your messenger he had to trust the message the angel came with the message if you want to change to be broken if you want to get all of your situation no longer found in prison follows this ancient message this message will bring you out anywhere now to follow him and was not that it was true which was done by an angel but he saw a vision when they were past the first and the second so that went beyond the first four they were beyond the second Pole but it was that opening of the world on the third Pole that will be on a broad complete delivery he that has begun a good work in you will finish it he's a virgin they're not flaws in my life he's begun a good work in you dojin I got shortcomings in my life he's begun a good work in you brother Jean I just seem to struggle with this he's begun a good work in you he that has begun a good work in you will finish it Peter got out that's the best gist of it but God was in control so here Peter begins to look at the situation and he looks at he's keeping his eyes on Jesus and perhaps a little build out starts to raise up a little bit he starts looking like this and people often ask this question how is this even possible yeah we've asked that question how is this happening and rather than trusting God feels like I don't believe I'm doing this we gotta be careful the words we choose we may not verbalize it but God knows what you're thinking about and peers like does this even make sense the spirits as as Peters probably walking towards Jesus their spirit is probably whispering things into his head that word is kind of deep in it you don't know what kind of sharks in there gray White's stingrays you can't even see underneath that water and Peter was in the predicament he was too far away to go back but he still had a little race to go many of us are in that predicament that's how we get into trouble was there I can't choose to go back I can't go back but I know I got a long ways to go and he's right there in the middle he's trying to figure out what to do and it's that in its in that weak and vulnerable moment the devil begins to whisper things so next thing you know Peter started to slowly sink and he starts to get into deep water he's gurgling water he's flapping his hands and the Bible says he cries out Jesus save me [Music] Jesus save me now I don't know how to really put it into words but that statement didn't even make sense to me but I could understand why he what he what he yelled it out he's calling the very name of the person who told him come to me as if Jesus didn't know that he was in this situation you're never in a spot not only here you're never in a spot that clap doesn't know exactly the situation near Falken he won't let you go back but he's not gonna lose Weasley in the journey he won't let you go back even if you wanted to he will not let you go back when the children of these will cross the Red Sea and the worst part of the way and the whole health of Israel do you know what happened the lordís came back again it was impossible for them to go back they are to be shot even if he decided to go back to the Lord I'm like it'll make it possible for me to abuse you Oh trial you're gonna have persecutions you know difficulties but I'm not gonna need you I helped here was sinking in despair sinking and stress sinking he was thinking man I should have stayed that you bouncing shall have left the boat well my friends right no well my friends right [Music] I should have just stayed with my friends but here he was in the middle of the ocean the middle of the sea sinking crying out as if Jesus is not right there watching the situation but he who has begun a good work in you all things work together for the good you know what in no doubt his friends were probably watching him from a distance and they probably thinks to themselves man things don't look good for Peter ah but now they had their critics they had their sing they're like I won't say hi he's gonna come out of this sure Jesus can walk on water by himself but I don't know how to how on the hike acara Peter by himself you probably had all kinds of things to say and they were looking because they know so Peter knew he couldn't call on his friends they had no ability to welcome water as long as Peter was in the ship little boys but when he left to try to be holier than thou because he was listening to God's Word they're like he's on his own praise the Christian walk is a lonely sometimes but that's okay my faith is not resting upon somebody criticizing me we have taken the change of the body has nothing to do with your opinions God loving me has nothing to do with what you say about it that was already predetermined before the foundation of the world you may not like my smile but that's okay that's the way God made me you may not like the way I walk but that's okay that's the way God made me human I like the way I talk but that's okay that's why God made me you got we gotta start loving one another cuz if we can't get alone on this side of glory eternity is a long time hey God with this sense of humor he'll put you right next to a person that you don't like to see praise the Lord so you sign we go spear in the middle of the sea his friends couldn't help him out so he could only call to one source Jesus save me so Jesus comes in the middle of his drowning and he offers one hand not to because to God nothing is impossible it wasn't difficult appears right here just flapping his hands sinking under the water gurgling some water jumping up looking at me worded looking a mess and I forgot it's probably a sense of humors like man all you have to do is just keep your eye on me only one thing you have to do I didn't tell you to shout I didn't tell you though backflips just keep your eye on me but you start looking at your problems you start wondering about this to know that you got this letter that you got in the mail a conversation you had with your boss but you know I found the conversation I didn't go well you started looking at all these problems you take your eyes off of Christ and Peter just flapping flapping just looking a mess gurgling water he's thinking that this is his way he's gonna die God comes to us when we don't look our best not everybody comes to you when you look at when you don't look your best when you're giving water I saw this one little clip online one time this little this little this little boy he wasn't must've been like a toddlers I'm like he's flipping around like he's drawing me he's pleading for help mom comes across if I remember correctly they stand up he stood up water was like rancor to him he was kinda confused like well I thought that's just like God is God just like man get up so one hand and help the hell and help him up Peter stood up he's like trying to explain it just look at that Jesus cuz he thought he saw the end of his life that's how God works with you there's nothing too big for him if we just step back and say he's the one that created the heavens and the earth he created the galaxies he created all this thing the vast expansion of space and you need something he can't take care of your little problems so here's the beauty of it he takes Peter picks it off Peter's Peter probably had this relief look and his friends his friends so Peter come out of that situation because the same God who called Peter is the same guy that could break me out of that situation so even when it looks like you're filming in life God knows how to make his victorious in front of your enemies in front of your critics and for those who have something to say negative about you God knows how to bring you and have you stand upon your own two feet and Jesus took Peter by the probably by the shoulder and walked with them the rest of the way he says I'm with you I appreciate your faith we have a little bit of it but I'm with you and I'm gonna walk we see the rest of the way and the Bible says the wind ceased I'm closing the wind cease your trial the last forever your persecutions they'll endure forever the battles they don't last flavor one of these days some of these things are just gonna stop leave apprecia gospel fill in last time you're gonna honor your last prayer for one last time we're gonna fight this fight this one last time it doesn't it's not always gonna last this way and the Bible says and when they would come onto the ship the wind ceased then spirits went away Jesus called on to Peter and brought them back in and protected him and watched over him now take a moment and reflect on where you're at in your life's journey where you are up to the struggles that you are enduring you're probably similar between the ship and Jesus and you're probably you're probably sinking right now trying to understand how am I gonna take care of this I got Monday around the corner I got choose day I got this obligation this commitment I got this family problem I got this health issues I got this I got this I got this I got this God's not worried about out there you gotta act upon one word come that's the word you gotta act upon and take an action not just st. amen here but when you're out there and you're under a lot of criticism you'll know a lot of you know a lot of scrutiny you can still say Amen be faithful to this word be faithful to this message mr.zhou Stan he loved the Lord that's just by hearts Lord Jesus I appreciate the inspiration of the word the Lord I gave of my heart this morning father the God I'm just encouraged by your word of truth I know in life's journey dear God there's going to be obstacles along the way there's gonna be challenges that we must confront but the Lord if we could just keep our eyes fixated upon you father we know that you could break down every wall of partition I recall when Solomon built the temple and in his prayer he said that if your people just looked towards the temple that whenever they're in trouble you will come and bring them help and deliverance such was the case of Jonah do God when he was in the belly of the whale and in the midst of all that darkness and flesh all around him there was an internal compass that was built within him that the Bible talks about he faced he positioned himself facing the temple and then he begins to other pond the name of Jehovah the way we realized that that was a type of how important for us to remain focused upon the temple of your holy word that whenever we find ourselves in a predicament that they live we know your hand is never too short to reach us but that your grace is sufficient in our lives father the God I just play where my words may have fallen short may the message that you're trying to convey to your people resonate within their hearts to God help us do not look to our writer to our left but to maintain that course and keeping our eyes fixated upon that word it is this endtime word that has brought me that has called me that has pulled me out and father I know you wouldn't have brought me along this journey to just let me be but as you said to your disciples go to the other side I believe the Lord he were destined to meet up with them as it is noted in the scripture and even as they came across winds that were contrary in their lives you still came out to meet them that message holds true to us this morning a promise has been made as positive this mortal must put on immortality this corruptible must put on incorruption and father here we are some of us are in a state of mess but that didn't mean the Lord deter you from coming to us and as we're submerged under water and overhead trying to make sense of life's unanswered questions you've always extended your hands of grace towards us and with what seems to be of little effort the ability to pull us out of the problems that were in the gun we're never too deep when your grace can find us too dark of a situation where the light can shine upon us thank you for your grace and mercy the Lord as we approach another week watch us protect us a lot of faith to be made in just what is represented here in this church the latest technology looks the fired back into the workplaces into the schools into the community and let them see that there's a light that shines in a dark place that there's a son and a daughter of God that's represented that there's a life the tree was empty for me to declare that my Lord is alive and will be with us stay with us in Jesus Christ name I pray amen god bless you say [Applause] I'm gonna appreciate the word of the Lord on today you know as brother Jean was just kind of bringing that to the close when you look at the scripture and talked about how Peter was was sinking and how Jesus just reached out his hand and I lifted him up and leave verse 32 says when they were come into the ship the wind ceased and what we don't get is whether Jesus carried him back to the ship or was it that and I just my imagination takes me to the place where all he did was just lift him up and when he lifts him up Peter just walked right along right back with Jesus so he was still walking on the water even after he failed see but you can walk as long as you got your eyes on Jesus and as long as you're walking with Jesus you can walk I tell you what I was just absolutely blessed a man by that and and amen [Applause] I know this I don't know what you know what any of us may be going through here today but I know that sometimes God has a way of speaking a man an indirect way to your direct situation right and there are some things that think God might be calling some of us to step out on faith if you um if you're gonna walk on water if then you got to get out the boat and I don't know what that might mean to you I don't know what your boat situation is but if you plan on walking on water you're gonna have to get out your boat and you're gonna have to take a step of faith and you know oftentimes we want to wait for the Lord to do something where actually God was waiting on people to do something and even when he was sinking even when he was sinking right he had the ability to call on the Lord and I love that that statement that brother Jean made that God knows how to make you look good and the mystery of enemies so even if you sink and everybody talking about you donít know where God got away just making you look good is that all the fellas that was in the boat my love he didn't call his brother Andrew was in the boat you know you know if you got you know older brother something like that you you come over help you know but no no he knew Andrew can do nothing for Jesus save me I tell you what I don't know I don't know what we face him but let's call him the Lord and let's watch him do it man what he does is it that God is that right let's sing [Music] [Music] No we're friendly [Music] fine strange embarrassed once a Stan my Vincente lives my savior's [Applause] your place man this yarders analytic the Saab will hallelujah when you won't start sooo hallelujah eyes we're doing surgery eyes my service liar my we gotta get Hubble call the point of me and I you treat my oh gee in specialized service I my dress is with out there take me we'll be and some money yes very spear my trusty take me we much stronger and some money my help No it take me to pay them mother down as in seven nights and I yes I will keep my eyes open there's personalized my same last name hi and don't give the Lord a hand of praise mother we thank you for your word you have a way of and directness speaking to our direct situations [Music] somebody here God that you're calling to take a step of faith and father there are times where certainly we feel like we're sinking but it's so good that we could call upon you Jesus to know that you're right there watching us you're never taking your eyes off of us and your encouragement is that all well all you had to do just you have little faith but whatever you do just don't doubt just keep walking you've already got started so just keep walking just keep keep persevering I got everything under control I'm not gonna leave you in this condition I'm not gonna let you be later shake father help us to take heed to the words that we spoke that we've heard here today and help us O God to not just look at it as just another Bible story that help us to apply it to our lives continue to use them to bless your servant Lord brother Jean acts that you would just continue to anoint him afresh just thank you for him getting himself out of the way and allow you to speak through him to us today father we play titular keepers other events that will be taking place today God as we just prepare for more the pinnacle palm service and also the combined service loaded in between just a baptism service that will have God we just pray that you bless that you just be a part of all these things now reacts acutely get all the glory that you get all the honor that you get all the grace and all that we do so Jesus name we pray amen and amen praise the Lord Amen let's give the Lord another hand of praise [Music] a man and they can be seated in the presence of the Lord the brothers will come to dismiss you on today remember to continue to keep Heather Jean and the specialist wife in prayer also don't forget that veteran is metal and then just remember hearing affairs and this gentleman I pray for earlier but Emmanuelle if you just remember him he had a situation a few years we had the opportunity years ago I went to Canada to preach and he opened up his home to allow us to come and stay while we were there and his wife was there son was there and just a guest earlier this month he he was at home and he went up to lay down and just take a little nap and his wife was on the phone with her mother and mother lives and ganas she was on the phone with her mother and and and somehow the son has slipped out of the house and went to the pool area of their home and he was actually draining the pool I think the pool only had about two feet of water in it and and somehow the son got into the pool and was drowning and in the two feet of order five years old and so the mother had hadn't recognized him and and she went looking for him and she found him there in the pool and and I believe the mother went into shock herself and she went on the phone that my son is dying and the phone dropped my cell her mom her and and the mother got in touch with buddy Maggie well said look we don't know what's going on but she said this and we don't know and he didn't know where she was so he went all around the neighborhood looking to try to find it and went into the garage confined her and finally to come back from the searching neighborhood he sent him to check the back yard and when he checked the back yard you saw both his wife and his mother I mean his wife and a son were in the pool a man and both of them both of them passed and so young man very young man to be going through something like that his name is brother Emanuel and if you all would just remember him and your prayers that God would just give him strength in order to make it through and persevere and then through the season of his life I greatly appreciated my god is too wise to make mistakes we know he has something big that's gonna come out at least it may be some life will be touched some kind of way through the midst of it and just please keep him in prayer that God would just give him strength to keep question the key person god bless you amen 5:30 at PIMCO Palms six started tonight for the West Coast Church the combined Service Commission [Music] [Music] [Music]
