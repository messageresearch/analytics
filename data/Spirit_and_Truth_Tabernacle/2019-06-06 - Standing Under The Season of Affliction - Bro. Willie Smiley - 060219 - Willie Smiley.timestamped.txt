[4:23] three are gathered you're in the midst
[4:24] Lord God and Laura God and if you're in
[4:27] the midst that means that healing is in

[1:23:05] me just a little bit you know you people
[1:23:09] you know things can become so common we
[1:23:14] take things for granted and it's like I
[1:23:16] don't want y'all to take for granted so
[1:23:19] I said I'm not gonna be here for two
[1:23:20] weeks and and get used to it cuz I'm
[1:23:23] gonna do some traveling I saw I was
[1:23:26] seeing good tip it's on on the social
[1:23:31] media and I told the church I'm a little
[1:23:33] bit of spiritual jealous I don't know
[1:23:35] why I wasn't with him
[1:23:37] I saw sister Brown and I I said lord
[1:23:41] have mercy hi this happen I should have
[1:23:45] been right that Widow
[1:23:46] I should have took my money I'm leaving
[1:23:49] y'all all right I see I want to see you
[1:23:52] but it didn't happen but I'm gonna try
[1:23:57] to make show I'm gonna get on some of
[1:23:59] these trips and even if I preach to do
[1:24:02] never just go and get out of get out of
[1:24:05] American soil it's been a long time
[1:24:09] since I've been to Europe anything I
[1:24:11] said god it's this is terrible but it's
[1:24:14] good to see everybody this morning all
[1:24:16] of my friends and loved ones it's good
[1:24:19] to be here y'all just continue pray for
[1:24:21] let's start at the first verse now y'all
[1:24:23] pray for me I hope I do not keep y'all
[1:24:25] alone but I can guarantee it I preached
[1:24:28] two hours to services last week so I
[1:24:31] hope y'all got y'all good and rested
[1:24:34] if not I'll scream at you a little bit
[1:24:37] let's start at the first verse it says
[1:24:39] wherefore when we could no longer
[1:24:40] forbear we thought it good to be left at
[1:24:44] Athens alone and sent timotheus our
[1:24:47] brother and minister of God and our
[1:24:50] fellow laborer in the gospel of Christ
[1:24:53] to establish you and to comfort you
[1:24:56] concerning your faith that no man should
[1:24:59] be moved by their afflictions for
[1:25:03] yourselves know that we are appointed
[1:25:05] thereon too for verily when we were with
[1:25:08] you we told you before that we should
[1:25:13] suffer tribulation even as it it came to
[1:25:16] pass and you know for this cause when I
[1:25:19] could no longer forbear I said to know
[1:25:22] your faithless by some means the tempter
[1:25:26] have tempted you and I labor being vain
[1:25:30] but now when timotheus came from you
[1:25:35] unto us and brought us good tidings of
[1:25:38] your faith and charity and that ye have
[1:25:42] good remembrance of us always designed
[1:25:45] quickly to see us as we also to see you
[1:25:48] I think that's the way it should
[1:25:51] being in the body of Christ we long to
[1:25:55] fellowship one with another it's that
[1:25:58] right if you don't have that kind of
[1:26:01] spirit something's wrong it shows it's
[1:26:04] not the nature of Jesus Christ
[1:26:06] so therefore brother we were comforted
[1:26:08] over you and all our afflictions and
[1:26:10] distress by your faith for now we live
[1:26:13] if you stand fast in the Lord for what
[1:26:17] thanks can we render to God again for
[1:26:20] you for all the joy will with we joy for
[1:26:24] your sakes be before our God night and
[1:26:27] day praying exceedingly that we might
[1:26:30] see your face in might perfect that
[1:26:33] which is lacking in your faith now God
[1:26:36] himself and our Father and Lord Jesus
[1:26:39] Christ
[1:26:40] direct I went unto you and and the Lord
[1:26:44] make you to increase in abound and loved
[1:26:48] one towards another and towards all men
[1:26:50] even as we do towards you to the end he
[1:26:54] may establish your hearts unblameable in
[1:26:56] holiness before God even our father at
[1:27:00] the coming of our Lord Jesus Christ with
[1:27:04] all of his saints you may be seated this
[1:27:06] morning
[1:27:06] may the Lord had a blessed to the
[1:27:08] reading of his word you may be seated
[1:27:10] this morning I like to use as a little
[1:27:14] topic this morning standing under the
[1:27:17] season of affliction being able to stand
[1:27:21] I want to just maybe take my time this
[1:27:24] morning and maybe bill one of the things
[1:27:28] we find here it was it was it was a
[1:27:31] difficult time for the Apostle Paul and
[1:27:34] I want to say this as I get started and
[1:27:38] I I've been just kind of working through
[1:27:40] different books of the Bible for the
[1:27:42] last year and a half or so trying to
[1:27:45] help the saints of God understand
[1:27:48] Scripture and understand that we're not
[1:27:53] just necessarily dealing with history I
[1:27:55] don't necessarily preach history
[1:27:59] historical gospel because I believe that
[1:28:01] the Bible is still alive
[1:28:03] one of the things I realized that you
[1:28:08] know the enemy is not dead
[1:28:10] they've read the same spirits that
[1:28:13] fought the early churches the same
[1:28:16] spirits that's fighting us as the Church
[1:28:18] of the Living God today is that right
[1:28:21] how many realized that we had a battle
[1:28:23] we're not we're not on a picnic this we
[1:28:27] got to keep certain things in mind this
[1:28:30] is a contest this is a contest brother
[1:28:34] branham preach the message contest this
[1:28:36] is a contest and and the enemy has an
[1:28:40] objective always always has been to
[1:28:43] steal killed and destroyed one of the
[1:28:45] things he has desired to be worshipped
[1:28:48] and and the prophet makes the statement
[1:28:51] I can't remember what what message it is
[1:28:54] he says he has actually accomplished his
[1:28:58] feet because we don't realize this and
[1:29:01] it's hard this is real difficult
[1:29:02] statement I'm amazed but people don't
[1:29:05] realize he's more worship right now this
[1:29:09] morning than God that's that's a very
[1:29:13] deep statement and and it take you being
[1:29:16] spiritual and really understanding your
[1:29:18] Bible right because because folk is
[1:29:21] going into Church and we we hallelujah
[1:29:24] and we shout and all that do not mean
[1:29:27] that you're a worshipping God right you
[1:29:32] you because you know Jesus when Jesus
[1:29:35] came on the scene he told the church now
[1:29:38] church folk he says in vain do you
[1:29:41] worship Me teaching for doctrines the
[1:29:43] commandments of man see and see one of
[1:29:48] these days if we don't already we gonna
[1:29:50] we're gonna get a clearer picture and
[1:29:53] understand why we needed a mouthpiece in
[1:29:56] this hour the corners back to the Bible
[1:29:59] right so that we could actually amen be
[1:30:03] worshipers of God right see we go all
[1:30:07] the way back
[1:30:08] amen to Genesis we found Cain right Cain
[1:30:11] was a worshipper he wasn't
[1:30:13] Fidel he will be worshipped but he
[1:30:16] worship according to his own dictates
[1:30:19] and God rejected it right I'm starting
[1:30:24] to feel something see he was worshiping
[1:30:29] he was a worshipper the prophecy he
[1:30:31] wasn't an infidel he built an altar
[1:30:34] Jeff's like Abel right and brought a
[1:30:39] sacrifice and God said no that ain't it
[1:30:42] right that's it but he said you know
[1:30:45] what God God is an opportunity she said
[1:30:48] you'd do well if you do like your
[1:30:49] brother that was real powerful yeah see
[1:30:53] he was trying to worship according to
[1:30:56] his own dictates he had his own
[1:30:58] approaches own you know way of thinking
[1:31:01] about things and God reject God said no
[1:31:04] sir that's not in his blood see because
[1:31:07] of God had her had accepted that it had
[1:31:10] to be man's dictates all the way down
[1:31:13] through the Bible come on any anything
[1:31:19] that we present to God he would have had
[1:31:21] to accept it right if he would have
[1:31:25] accepted Amen I'm gonna go somewhere
[1:31:27] this morning but I'm just trying to get
[1:31:29] out of the way but God rejected that to
[1:31:31] show us if we go to worship God we got a
[1:31:34] worship God Amen according to his word
[1:31:37] right and anytime you start getting
[1:31:42] outside of his word you started yeah
[1:31:45] when we start forming things and adding
[1:31:48] things we start pushing God out right
[1:31:51] right
[1:31:52] see and and you'll feel something you'll
[1:31:55] feel an anointing and that's the thing
[1:31:57] that's deceiving right right
[1:32:00] people will be anointed they'll feel
[1:32:04] something then they'll cry that shout
[1:32:07] know all of that but the teachers will
[1:32:11] be - false teachers of the word of God
[1:32:14] I'll leave that for brother Jack
[1:32:17] no more imma imma go ahead and try to go
[1:32:20] a different direction this morning
[1:32:22] that's the truth of northern ones at the
[1:32:24] end time right Amen and see let me leave
[1:32:29] this alone cuz I won't get the well but
[1:32:34] the thing that the thing that we find
[1:32:36] this morning is is that the Apostle Paul
[1:32:39] he was he initially dealing with the the
[1:32:43] Thessalonians in and you know I did a
[1:32:45] little history on it so that we could
[1:32:48] get a real understanding of what's the
[1:32:52] writing all about right well what's
[1:32:55] happening and why why is Paul writing to
[1:32:59] the Thessalonians and what's the
[1:33:00] background of it so that we could really
[1:33:03] preach the Bible to folk right priests
[1:33:06] preach the message y'all still with me
[1:33:08] y'all look wide right one of the things
[1:33:13] that we find you know i'ma try to cram a
[1:33:17] couple of chapters and before we get to
[1:33:21] the third chapter what we find is is
[1:33:24] that the Apostle Paul now you go back
[1:33:26] and do your history on and just don't
[1:33:29] take my word for it the Apostle Paul he
[1:33:34] spent a very short period of time
[1:33:37] dealing with the Thessalonians initially
[1:33:40] he had him how according to history
[1:33:42] about maybe three weeks of preaching
[1:33:45] Christ to the people right and and was
[1:33:49] kind of run out of town y'all know Paul
[1:33:51] had a very very hard time and trying to
[1:33:55] work with the people but what was most
[1:33:57] gratifying for the Apostle Paul was was
[1:34:01] that they were predestinated see that
[1:34:05] was their right see one of the things I
[1:34:07] learned you you don't have to fight with
[1:34:09] folk when it comes down to the message
[1:34:12] right right you really don't see if
[1:34:16] people if people are predestinated
[1:34:20] they're gonna they're gonna grasp it
[1:34:22] they're gonna gravitate towards it right
[1:34:25] see there's a responder on the inside
[1:34:27] that's something inside a man to receive
[1:34:31] something there to be quickly because
[1:34:34] nyancy can't be quickened see a lot of
[1:34:38] times we as ministers a lot of times we
[1:34:41] spend a whole lot of time and and
[1:34:42] Rosalynn with foking trying to get
[1:34:46] people to believe it if there's nothing
[1:34:49] in you to believe you're not gonna
[1:34:52] believe right if it's learning you if
[1:34:56] you were not in the mind of God before
[1:34:58] the foundation of the world you will not
[1:35:02] believe now I'm gonna stop right here
[1:35:08] because you throw people right right but
[1:35:12] we gotta understand the other aspects of
[1:35:15] the scripture I everybody that don't
[1:35:18] believe the message I'm gonna make a
[1:35:20] strong statement don't mean everybody's
[1:35:22] going to hell say I don't want us to
[1:35:25] walk around we used to walk around like
[1:35:27] that
[1:35:28] they don't believe this message
[1:35:33] come on priests with me somebody they
[1:35:37] don't believe this message they ain't
[1:35:39] God they might not be in the city but
[1:35:43] that don't mean that they can't a man
[1:35:45] get eternal life they just gotta go to
[1:35:47] the white throne judgment they get it
[1:35:50] see it's it's this word that position it
[1:35:54] places you in the body yeah see wasn't
[1:35:59] one of the things that I appreciate
[1:36:00] about God sending us a prophet he
[1:36:04] educated us he gave us an understanding
[1:36:07] of what the Brethren down to history I
[1:36:12] was actually doing with their ministry
[1:36:16] right amen Paul Paul on the foundation
[1:36:21] right cuz it's about Redemption coming
[1:36:24] to believe that dealing with the New
[1:36:27] Testament church building amen I'm
[1:36:30] Bryce's body right Paul Paul the word
[1:36:35] post Paul you know the dispensation of
[1:36:38] the gospel was given to Paul
[1:36:40] is that right he said in one place he
[1:36:43] said he was given the mysteries that
[1:36:45] were were here before the foundation of
[1:36:48] the world see and what Paul brought the
[1:36:52] brother amen in his day he brought the
[1:36:56] people truth right no error right there
[1:37:03] perfect interpretation of the Word of
[1:37:05] God under Paul's ministry let's see I
[1:37:09] like this because it helps me to
[1:37:13] understand the statements that God
[1:37:16] service brought when he says you know I
[1:37:18] talked with Paul all right being a
[1:37:23] prophet being the mouthpiece in this
[1:37:26] generation realizes by elevating in the
[1:37:31] spirit that's why you got to get in the
[1:37:33] spiritual you cannot be Conaway come to
[1:37:37] church you gotta get in the spirit
[1:37:40] in the church age book to hearing no see
[1:37:44] if you don't get in the spirit you'll
[1:37:47] never comprehend anything they're
[1:37:49] getting minister ever says to you it'll
[1:37:53] be Connolly's just be like water rolling
[1:37:55] off a duck's back but if you can cut
[1:37:57] them but the Bible says you gonna
[1:37:59] understand it if you're predestinated of
[1:38:02] God this morning you've been
[1:38:04] predestinated to understand see those
[1:38:11] brethren in those Thessalonians they
[1:38:15] will predestinated my god right right
[1:38:19] three week sometime we're at some with
[1:38:24] 300 years with folks and they still
[1:38:26] don't get it three week of preaching
[1:38:33] cries and something quick yeah
[1:38:38] think of a predestination that's all
[1:38:40] I tell you I can't fully explain it but
[1:38:44] I believe it you have to you if you're
[1:38:47] here this morning you was predestinated
[1:38:50] before the foundation of the world to be
[1:38:52] here right no matter how often and we
[1:38:58] all fall short that's the body we all
[1:39:00] fall short you know sometimes we think
[1:39:02] we gonna get away in God said hey man I
[1:39:09] saw you before I'm glad God saw me when
[1:39:12] I was jacked up brother Jack alright
[1:39:15] that's the truth anyhow when I was
[1:39:19] running around the streets of Palm Beach
[1:39:20] County chasing the little white ghosts
[1:39:24] God saw me when I was acting the fool in
[1:39:30] New Jersey God saw me God my life was
[1:39:35] purposed by God goodbye before I ever
[1:39:39] even knew the term purpose in God right
[1:39:43] beginning God being a part of the will
[1:39:47] of God name written in the Lamb's Book
[1:39:50] of Life before before I knew all of that
[1:39:53] God you meet brother kid I didn't know
[1:39:56] what I'm talking about
[1:39:57] but can it kind of had some of them
[1:39:59] experiences like me right and to be able
[1:40:02] to sit here this morning and to be able
[1:40:04] to express God in the manner that a man
[1:40:07] we can express God that's just the grace
[1:40:10] of God to us this morning is that right
[1:40:13] a man say but you know as I preach this
[1:40:18] at home and I preached this last weekend
[1:40:20] what I was I was I was showing I was
[1:40:23] trying to show the church this is a
[1:40:26] contest and the things that you know
[1:40:30] Satan is strategic strategic in his
[1:40:34] attacks right a man you know it was not
[1:40:39] by chance
[1:40:42] that you know the Apostle Paul was being
[1:40:47] fault it wasn't my chance that you know
[1:40:50] brother Branham was constantly being
[1:40:53] fought every step of the way right right
[1:40:57] you know in the first of the second
[1:41:00] chapter of Thessalonians Paul was
[1:41:03] happened to defend his character before
[1:41:08] the church and that's unfortunate but it
[1:41:13] wasn't necessarily to the church it was
[1:41:15] outside influences trying to bring in
[1:41:20] and so the seed of discrepancy right in
[1:41:25] the church to bring to bring separation
[1:41:29] right they they will make a statement
[1:41:32] st. Paul was trying to you know you know
[1:41:37] his his motors wasn't right his
[1:41:39] objective wasn't right and a man please
[1:41:42] empower Paul with a character
[1:41:45] assassination and how many times have we
[1:41:48] seen that in church where the Shepherd's
[1:41:52] have got to defend their character Paul
[1:41:56] told him in so many words he said look
[1:41:59] man I was a monkey how allow me y'all
[1:42:03] know me I didn't ask for money we worked
[1:42:07] we work the monkey he totally said
[1:42:12] something man God had given us the Word
[1:42:15] of God in truth he says my life was
[1:42:20] above board
[1:42:21] alright y'all gonna have to go back and
[1:42:23] read the Bible I'm just gonna kind of
[1:42:25] move
[1:42:29] [Music]
[1:42:45] he knew you could not handle the
[1:42:50] fire-god unless you have a clean life
[1:42:59] you know if you got a Scofield Bobby you
[1:43:02] look in the head and Paul it talks about
[1:43:04] Paul being a model servant Yeah right
[1:43:07] hey that's an example right how could
[1:43:12] Paul be an example to the church and
[1:43:14] have a jacked up life see that would one
[1:43:20] of the sons of guila see they stood in
[1:43:24] the gate and cheating and robbed see
[1:43:27] that one didn't mention the Spirit of
[1:43:29] God see Paul was displaying powers of
[1:43:32] living example God right Rossi he knew
[1:43:37] that he couldn't hand in a fire god
[1:43:39] robbing and cheating and stealing and
[1:43:41] things of that nature see even though
[1:43:44] workman is worthy of his hire
[1:43:45] Paul said look we worked we worked come
[1:43:49] on
[1:43:49] see Amen I wasn't I wasn't here attacks
[1:43:52] to challenge right but yeah he had to
[1:43:57] defend his character before people
[1:44:01] because but it shows it was outside
[1:44:05] influence not see come on not see about
[1:44:09] come on I'm helping you to understand
[1:44:11] that solonian when we preach in history
[1:44:15] now so so you could see you could you
[1:44:20] could really see and identify because
[1:44:24] Christ is identified by his
[1:44:26] characteristics Satan is identified by
[1:44:29] his characteristics come on
[1:44:33] amen see no matter how much you say
[1:44:37] you're a Christian and you're this
[1:44:39] you're that your honor
[1:44:41] by your characteristics thank you all
[1:44:49] with me like I say I thank y'all with
[1:44:58] but I'm a priest to you anyway cuz we
[1:45:03] just like we was telling say so I'm here
[1:45:05] to help
[1:45:06] like brother Jack with Sam brother let's
[1:45:09] go need help you know we've tried to
[1:45:10] tell the let's go that for years I've
[1:45:13] never priced alighted nobody ever cuz
[1:45:18] you to proselytize you make a person to
[1:45:20] fold more child of Hell than anything
[1:45:22] that's the quote yeah and the scripture
[1:45:25] all right right right people call it has
[1:45:29] called me over the years better smart be
[1:45:32] later God be certain of God be led of
[1:45:36] God see if if I pulled you then I got I
[1:45:41] got a baby I gotta give you a position I

[1:45:52] see my merica I don't have time to baby
[1:45:56] and call you when you at church y'all
[1:45:59] right all the time Bobby says sometimes
[1:46:02] we gotta learn how to encourage
[1:46:03] ourselves in the law don't start
[1:46:07] preaching out the way sometimes you just
[1:46:11] got to encourage yourself you know David
[1:46:14] David David had nothing to do I ain't
[1:46:17] met him in the brother rules they come
[1:46:19] back and all the families a man was
[1:46:22] taken into captivity
[1:46:35] go right along with show family they
[1:46:40] were like what we ought to kill you
[1:46:41] David he was once been loved
[1:46:45] now that was ready to kill him because
[1:46:48] because a man the enemy had them come in
[1:46:51] a man and taken out the families out of
[1:46:54] the church and they like oh my god David
[1:46:57] you supposed to be the past you supposed
[1:47:01] to be the head how could this be
[1:47:08] David's look back and saying you know
[1:47:10] every what David wrote that for me and
[1:47:13] not again you just gotta learn how to
[1:47:16] see it because if you wait on people to
[1:47:19] encourage you sometime you'll be a man
[1:47:22] waiting along see I don't sit around and
[1:47:28] wait on people to call me cuz I learn
[1:47:31] people do not call you and when they
[1:47:36] call you they Madeline they seeking
[1:47:42] something to take out that a man is
[1:47:44] sprayed so amen

[1:47:54] smiley really praise a lot they won't
[1:47:57] information the spread they won't motor
[1:48:01] they want an ant most fuel on the
[1:48:03] brother smiley come on
[1:48:24] but it's the truth in half it's a lot of
[1:48:27] things that I don't like but I I'll come
[1:48:29] down on them criticize my family right
[1:48:34] from that what but see the enemy is
[1:48:38] strategic right Paul had the Word of
[1:48:43] Life
[1:48:44] come on Paul being the message to the
[1:48:48] Gentile Church right Peter was giving
[1:48:52] the word to the uncircumcised Paul was
[1:48:54] giving the word right
[1:48:56] come on see to the Gentiles he started
[1:49:01] out with the Jews they turned it down
[1:49:03] then God sent them to the Gentiles he
[1:49:08] had the message of the power right he
[1:49:12] was not preaching the law Yeah right
[1:49:15] amen see he came preaching grace he came
[1:49:19] preaching Jesus Christ right he came
[1:49:23] pretty preaching the kingdom message
[1:49:25] right to group of people who who had no
[1:49:30] concept no perspective cuz God we know
[1:49:34] under the on the Old Testament was
[1:49:36] dealing with the Jews right God in His
[1:49:43] sovereignty had me on his mind
[1:49:47] throughout seven changes God had me on
[1:49:51] his my own if he had y'all on his mind
[1:49:53] now y'all gonna speak me ourself this
[1:49:55] morning but God through some it took
[1:49:59] seven chart changes and knowing that
[1:50:03] open the other world will come and I
[1:50:05] will come to the opening of the world he
[1:50:08] did it for me
[1:50:09] I just wish sister Lulu see right now I
[1:50:15] felt that but I can't sing it like she
[1:50:18] felt used to sing it all right so she
[1:50:22] Lewis was the only person I know could
[1:50:23] sit at the back of the church and tear
[1:50:24] the whole front of the Church of the
[1:50:26] Lord she was wonderful name he did it
[1:50:30] for me Jesus did it for me see wait but
[1:50:34] notice notice Paul being the messenger
[1:50:38] right the apostle to the aides Paul was
[1:50:42] giving the Adept
[1:50:44] that even peeling them didn't even have
[1:50:47] right Peter Peter was like man POW deep
[1:50:51] in so many words right
[1:50:53] you have no description now I'm
[1:50:55] paraphrasing and that's not exactly but
[1:50:58] you got to be a Bible reader right Paul
[1:51:02] Paul Paul dealt with things in on a
[1:51:04] level that they was like my card huh but
[1:51:09] watch watch the enemy so that you I want
[1:51:12] to show us something this morning right
[1:51:15] because it's the devil his ambitious
[1:51:19] hasn't changed because y'all up in here
[1:51:21] shouting and having a good time I'm
[1:51:23] gonna tell you something the devil is
[1:51:25] after you
[1:51:28] true brother branham under the
[1:51:31] inspiration a word to the church right
[1:51:35] he said you know what the devil he don't
[1:51:37] heat it he don't like to see the church
[1:51:39] all in harmony and one one mind and one
[1:51:43] Accord but you could look in Genesis and
[1:51:46] see that right right he said nobody
[1:51:49] he'll he'll do something he'll sit
[1:51:51] somebody that they might sit there for a
[1:51:53] long time huh he said no matter what it
[1:51:58] is he said when things started and then
[1:52:01] don't take sides clean together
[1:52:06] stay with the Word of God you know what
[1:52:10] I made I made a statement last week and
[1:52:14] I don't even know y'all might have heard
[1:52:15] this quote if y'all having I'm a quoting
[1:52:17] brother Branham says that he's ordained
[1:52:20] to lead you through yo tell you
[1:52:29] something thats why from a strategic
[1:52:33] standpoint the enemy always fights the
[1:52:36] head yeah right
[1:52:40] yeah one of the key is a star cut
[1:52:45] why because if he could get fingers
[1:52:48] pointed at the shepherd right if he
[1:52:52] could get y'all gossiping and whispering
[1:52:54] about the pastor's child what the
[1:52:58] pastor's wife and daughter dissing any
[1:53:01] other he know he's gonna that's gonna be
[1:53:05] a distraction right it's gonna take
[1:53:08] change it should change our views but
[1:53:11] it'll change for reals right but but
[1:53:15] Satan doesn't realize it if I can take
[1:53:18] this Shepherd and get this shepherd
[1:53:21] either way I'm gonna destroy the Sheep
[1:53:25] come on come on that's why we need a
[1:53:30] shop cuz the nature of the sheep they
[1:53:35] can't lead themselves they're
[1:53:38] defenseless they need a shepherd right
[1:53:47] now let me say something here this can't
[1:53:50] be strong 90 Vangelis not a prophet even
[1:53:54] brother Bentham had a pastor people
[1:54:00] don't realize that brother no who was
[1:54:02] his best they Co passed it he said
[1:54:06] different ways right he told the people
[1:54:09] he said when I go out he said come here
[1:54:11] brother never here do you call it
[1:54:14] yeah why would he make a statement like
[1:54:16] that because he knew he'd break the
[1:54:17] Scriptures to preach a prophet only
[1:54:20] message follow just thou me none you
[1:54:28] break every scripture in the Bible you
[1:54:30] start doing that but you can't take
[1:54:39] Ephesians 4:30 out of the Bible I'll
[1:54:44] take the other phones the other four
[1:54:47] parts of the ministry
[1:54:48] see that's why we'll be talking this
[1:54:51] nonsense about push playing we don't
[1:54:52] need this then it's like oh come on
[1:54:54] praise the Lord
[1:54:55] well what we're gonna do with the rest
[1:54:57] of the Bible we might have a close the
[1:54:59] book come on
[1:55:01] see but the devil knew that if he could
[1:55:05] keep a man paul away from the
[1:55:08] Thessalonians the Thessalonians even
[1:55:11] though they had gravitated towards truth
[1:55:14] right and accepted accepted truth accept
[1:55:20] it what see in it I'm strike something
[1:55:23] right because you find people say well
[1:55:26] that's just the thoughts and the
[1:55:28] opinions and things of that nature of
[1:55:30] men see watch because we we got to have
[1:55:36] we got the house
[1:55:37] thing that we're looking at as an
[1:55:39] example to us amen as the bride of Jesus
[1:55:42] Christ these brethren that were
[1:55:45] predestinated says you know what we
[1:55:47] received this word this truth not as
[1:55:51] words of a manner go back and read it
[1:55:56] but as the words of God enos the words
[1:56:00] of a man honest the words of God don't
[1:56:26] see weak that's our model right the
[1:56:31] Thessalonians they said look man when
[1:56:34] when Paul brought them truth they they
[1:56:36] perceive that it wasn't just some random
[1:56:40] words of some man no this is God see and
[1:56:46] when we look at the message of the hour
[1:56:50] right Bible prophecy
[1:56:55] I heard brother better make a statement
[1:56:57] in the rapture a couple of weeks ago I
[1:57:01] listened to the wraps at work I got so
[1:57:04] excited I must listen to that one
[1:57:05] statement like five times right so cuz
[1:57:10] sometimes we got to understand what what
[1:57:12] we're talking about we people do a lot
[1:57:14] of talking but they don't know what they
[1:57:15] be talking about really I'll be honest
[1:57:17] with you
[1:57:18] am I in the message and all of this kind
[1:57:20] of stuff you got to know what you're
[1:57:21] talking about all I hope I don't throw
[1:57:24] y'all but if I do then make you prayer
[1:57:27] study more right say you hear and you
[1:57:33] can go back and read this in the rapture
[1:57:34] message I can't quote you the page
[1:57:36] whatever I was listening to it he says
[1:57:38] he says you hear man talk about a
[1:57:42] message of the hour he says what are
[1:57:44] they getting it
[1:57:45] he said they're getting that is
[1:57:47] scriptural Bible
[1:57:50] truth for the day that's what that's
[1:57:54] what the message of the hour is come on
[1:57:58] about you you can pull it up later right
[1:58:01] that's what it is what are you talking
[1:58:05] about explain that to me it's almost on
[1:58:07] on the lines of when we was coming up
[1:58:09] I'd never forget this I'd never forget
[1:58:12] it me sister Burrell and my wife we mrs.
[1:58:16] Jean Wendy when you're talking back then
[1:58:18] we used to work together and we used to
[1:58:21] go to those conventions and brother Jack
[1:58:23] knowing talk about sister Erica all of
[1:58:25] us back in the day man we go and we
[1:58:27] shout and have a big time and come back
[1:58:30] and and nobody knew nothing nothing when
[1:58:35] I say nothing we didn't know anything
[1:58:38] y'all going to tell my sister and sister
[1:58:40] Dixon sister Brown almost all old Thomas
[1:58:43] I remember I remember we just come back
[1:58:47] from the meeting and but we had a good
[1:58:49] time we were crying and we was weeping
[1:58:51] and all of that and and I was on a break
[1:58:54] and sister sister bird I guess she was
[1:58:56] on a break but I was standing out in the
[1:58:58] front of the building I was maintenance
[1:59:01] guy and she simply you know and I ain't
[1:59:03] been in here a lot as long as they had
[1:59:05] been and she came up to me and she said
[1:59:08] up that's why I won't ask you a question
[1:59:11] she said what is the seven thunders I
[1:59:15] paused for a minute
[1:59:17] I took her deep breath like Oh Lord Lord
[1:59:22] now if she don't know and she'd been
[1:59:25] here longer than me and all I could do
[1:59:30] at that time is going what I've heard
[1:59:33] Christ
[1:59:36] cries yeah it is Christ don't say it's
[1:59:44] the voice of God but you see we screamed
[1:59:50] and we hollered and we jumped and we
[1:59:52] shot and we ran around the building we
[1:59:54] knew nothing we don't know nothin that's
[1:59:58] the truth in it huh yeah
[2:00:00] glory to a wonderful name we had
[2:00:03] something but it's just like Benjamin
[2:00:06] Franklin I got it what you got see
[2:00:11] somebody else had to come on the scene
[2:00:14] and fully express what he had bring to
[2:00:20] manifestation a man what he had but he
[2:00:23] didn't have something right we do have
[2:00:26] something and we thank God that we got
[2:00:30] ministers that can break into it and
[2:00:32] show us what we see I'm stumbling in the
[2:00:38] slaughter right I ain't trembling right
[2:00:41] I don't know what we got see a man
[2:00:44] brother brother brother some ministry
[2:00:47] helped me to identify spirits helped me
[2:00:53] to see the world a man not in the
[2:00:57] historical cuz he said he preached the
[2:00:59] message raising them up out of history
[2:01:01] weaning history the devil is the devil
[2:01:05] today he's real see what I'm trying to
[2:01:10] show us something
[2:01:11] Paul Paul wanted to see Paul wanted to
[2:01:15] make sure that with everything that he
[2:01:19] was putting in man it wasn't in vain
[2:01:22] right I wrote a love footnote right in
[2:01:27] my tablet you know - you spent all our
[2:01:32] efforts you you till the ground you
[2:01:36] prepare the ground you you you you get
[2:01:39] the seed in your place water and don't
[2:01:42] get at harvest nothing comes forth did
[2:01:48] you imagine being a farmer
[2:01:51] you've suite countless dollars countless
[2:01:54] effort right right come on and then in

[2:02:59] something right quick and this is from a
[2:03:07] commentary and I'm a Regis a statement
[2:03:10] from Spurgeon's but it fits all right it

[2:03:18] Word of God and that I be honest with
[2:03:21] y'all I'll tell people I don't just you
[2:03:23] know sometimes I read things as
[2:03:25] commentaries because I study I don't

[2:04:05] say you welcome with the statement that
[2:04:09] I just made about the church he says you
[2:04:11] welcomed it not as the words of men but
[2:04:15] as it is in truth right the Word of God
[2:04:20] it is this is even this is the Word of
[2:04:24] God or the word of a man now it's up to
[2:04:28] you to determine I can't do it for you
[2:04:30] right right the Thessalonians received
[2:04:34] the Word of God as it is in truth Paul
[2:04:38] presented it not as the words of men and
[2:04:42] the Thessalonians received it as the
[2:04:45] words of God now how do we receive it
[2:04:48] how do we receive a man not just brother
[2:04:51] branham right because we're the final
[2:04:54] voice to the final eight right with our
[2:04:57] messenger we're not a final voice so

[2:05:22] right
[2:05:22] somebody somebody told him why shock
[2:05:26] them last week see cuz you find that
[2:05:30] people really don't know the Bible I'm
[2:05:32] not being critical but I'm just being
[2:05:34] honest yeah right you know that's times
[2:05:37] where Paul wrote well Paul it was no
[2:05:39] great discernment people wrote the poll
[2:05:42] and told him about the problems so it's
[2:05:46] like it's not a bad I ain't no snitch so
[2:05:51] you just rather the devil take over the
[2:05:53] church then no snitch
[2:05:54] they say this ain't no
[2:05:57] this ain't Connell this spiritual see a
[2:06:01] man you gonna be hell responsible for
[2:06:05] the spirit of true tabernacle
[2:06:06] if y'all sit round time and I know sleds
[2:06:09] and knowing that folk doing all kind of
[2:06:12] stuff up in the childhood go back to the
[2:06:17] Hebrews series yeah see what brother
[2:06:23] Jack is you know in the household they
[2:06:26] wrote says it's problems right the
[2:06:29] household of Chloe right power power
[2:06:34] when he wrote back he said you know I
[2:06:35] partly believe that I just believe it's
[2:06:38] craziness going on Corinthians immature
[2:06:41] and everything else right Paul II have
[2:06:45] no deep discernment no it's a lot going
[2:06:52] on up in hill
[2:07:22] [Applause]
[2:07:31] come on we sit around let people talk
[2:07:34] about your pastors and all that okay
[2:07:37] guys you got them each of these guys
[2:07:39] gonna get you after a while
[2:07:40] come on priest with me somebody ain't
[2:07:43] come to preach so now I'm gonna leave
[2:07:44] that alone
[2:07:44] it's true we let so much go on and we
[2:07:48] won amen
[2:07:49] then don't sing right no see this thing
[2:07:56] is got to be pure it's got to stay pure
[2:07:58] you get right down to the end of the
[2:08:00] Bible into this chapter with Paul and
[2:08:03] I'm gonna be going in a minute
[2:08:04] well Paul talked about wanting to come
[2:08:07] because he knew that they still needed
[2:08:09] growth they still needed growth see and
[2:08:13] this is the reason why say don't want to
[2:08:15] keep Paul out of the mist this is why
[2:08:17] you know the enemy keeps everything
[2:08:21] going on in the church to keep us free
[2:08:24] growing see but see they receded as the
[2:08:29] Word of God he says not but I want to
[2:08:31] get to this place and I then we - out of
[2:08:34] here
[2:08:35] he said not everyone receives this
[2:08:37] message as the Word of God right yet
[2:08:42] when they do not receive it it reflects
[2:08:47] upon them not a punt the lesson brother
[2:08:53] branham didn't even make that statement
[2:08:54] that's from spurge that was fit to be
[2:09:00] read with when I read that brother Jack
[2:09:03] I said Oh something y'all know I'm heavy
[2:09:08] I don't need to be standing on it and I
[2:09:11] need to be on subsonic glory to God see
[2:09:16] not everyone see it reflects upon them
[2:09:19] not the message he said means free we
[2:09:25] ought to be set free because because
[2:09:28] people don't does nothing against the
[2:09:32] message because we had a few fruit of
[2:09:35] the message right he says that ye have
[2:09:40] not perceived spiritual things is true
[2:09:43] let me back up so I make it sound good
[2:09:46] not everyone that receives this message
[2:09:48] as the Word of God yet when they do not
[2:09:51] receive it
[2:09:52] it reflects upon them not upon the
[2:09:55] message that he have not perceived
[2:09:58] spiritual things is true but
[2:10:02] is no proof that there are none to
[2:10:07] proceed it's saying okay there's people
[2:10:12] that don't perceive but there are people
[2:10:14] that proceed get on the internet and we
[2:10:19] spent countless dollars trying to
[2:10:21] disprove it you can't it's fruitless
[2:10:26] because that's for as many people is
[2:10:30] walk away and criticized there's just
[2:10:32] that many more people that double-double
[2:10:35] [Applause]
[2:10:39] many people that comes in and folk just
[2:10:43] be making room for other folk it's no
[2:10:49] proof you can't disprove this ain't
[2:10:53] right because there's too many people
[2:10:55] that understands that proceeds right
[2:10:59] he said the whole case is like this of
[2:11:01] an Irishman who tried to upset evidence
[2:11:05] by non evidence he says four witnesses
[2:11:09] saw him commit a murder he played it he
[2:11:14] played it that he was not guilty and
[2:11:16] wished to establish his innocence by
[2:11:21] producing 40 persons who did not see him
[2:11:24] do it that don't even make sense he
[2:11:29] wanna upset evidence and look how many
[2:11:32] people that be trying to obsess what's
[2:11:34] already been vindicated by God and prove
[2:11:38] it
[2:11:40] oh hey man he says still see him doing
[2:11:52] he said I what use would that have been
[2:11:55] what this kids good he says so if 40
[2:11:59] people declare that there is no power of
[2:12:03] the Holy Ghost going with the Word of
[2:12:06] God this only proves that the 40 people
[2:12:11] do not know what the other people know
[2:12:21] that means folk don't know what you know
[2:12:27] [Applause]
[2:12:32] what you know people about what I know
[2:12:44] [Music]
[2:12:46] and it's ain't God they reveal this to
[2:12:49] me gotta reveal it to you because you
[2:12:52] don't know it don't be wrong it just me
[2:12:58] you just can't proceed can't proceed let
[2:13:08] me prove you this
[2:13:09] he made a statement here why did it is
[2:13:11] it because listen if there's nothing in
[2:13:15] you to quicken I can explain to you
[2:13:18] things all day long are you not gonna
[2:13:22] get it none of us know it all but God
[2:13:32] reveals things in season when the season
[2:13:39] comes that you need to know something
[2:13:41] that you need to understand something
[2:13:44] blood brother Coleman back in the day
[2:13:54] did know that he was prophesied to me he
[2:13:58] used to make that statement I used to
[2:13:59] look at him but I don't understand I
[2:14:01] can't say that today see I understand
[2:14:05] what the seven thunders it's not afraid
[2:14:07] of that no I don't get on top of that
[2:14:10] because you know seven thunders give
[2:14:12] faithful all of that understand now see
[2:14:16] I'm not afraid of it glory to God
[2:14:22] see they will make your statements but I
[2:14:25] understand in this hour
[2:14:27] right I understand what those things
[2:14:29] meant or me see so I'm saying something
[2:14:34] this morning
[2:14:35] don't worry about folk that cannot
[2:14:37] perceive just look around you know
[2:14:40] that's the people up in here they're
[2:14:42] perceived because I knew that there were
[2:14:50] people up in spiritual tabernacle that
[2:14:53] perceived that this is not the words of
[2:14:57] my man this is the words of God see so -
[2:15:03] spend all my time explain to me this
[2:15:06] explain to me ask me this question and
[2:15:09] this time for that my time is valuable
[2:15:11] you ain't finna waste it even the way
[2:15:14] slapped oh so full I said if I could
[2:15:16] explain to you is this gonna change your
[2:15:18] views if it's not gonna change them from
[2:15:20] let's stop this nonsense now because my
[2:15:23] time is valuable I ain't gonna let you
[2:15:25] take it up and waste it I'll rather be
[2:15:30] somewhere eating me some oxtails us up
[2:15:32] then to be sitting up in here messing
[2:15:35] with you come on round four round and
[2:15:37] you just you got question after question
[2:15:39] after question after question that's
[2:15:42] that don't mean nothing tell you I'd
[2:15:47] rather be somewhere window shopping a
[2:15:49] shopping or anything I'm just gonna be
[2:15:51] honest which then all you would focus
[2:15:56] Eve open to go watch the Apostle Paul
[2:16:04] all right you know that's a reaction to
[2:16:09] an action and Paul Paul realizes that he
[2:16:13] couldn't get get in slices you know what
[2:16:15] I'm a sin Timothy glory to God so think
[2:16:23] about if we didn't have a fire phone
[2:16:25] ministry if it was a message of only
[2:16:29] type ministry he couldn't get in who
[2:16:32] would have got in right he said you know
[2:16:36] what I don't know how to defeat this
[2:16:38] devil right now I'm I can't
[2:16:40] but that's somebody who believe what I
[2:16:43] believe I'm I'm a sin that individual in
[2:16:48] for the purpose of amen
[2:16:51] establishing and comfort because you
[2:16:54] can't be a comfort comforted until you
[2:16:56] established right and once you
[2:17:00] established in the Word of God then you
[2:17:02] find comfort see you're not easily
[2:17:05] swayed you're not moved by the things
[2:17:09] that's that surround you see part the
[2:17:11] Apostle Paul told me so listen I tried
[2:17:13] to tell you that we're gonna be
[2:17:15] afflicted but Paul Paul was was
[2:17:18] concerned about the people because I'm
[2:17:21] just closing something preach you know
[2:17:23] ain't crayons I ain't gonna take out too
[2:17:25] long this morning right Paul was so
[2:17:28] concerned as as a servant of God just
[2:17:30] like brother Jack and these brothers
[2:17:32] that concern about about a man making
[2:17:35] sure that the people are anchored in the
[2:17:39] faith see one thing I'm convinced -
[2:17:43] always been 21 years of pastor I know if
[2:17:47] you could get people to sit still long
[2:17:49] enough the word not me as a man but the
[2:17:54] word amen
[2:17:55] do everything that the word salem doing
[2:17:59] the heart and life of the individual but
[2:18:01] you've got to get people to stand still
[2:18:02] right see if it was it was much it was
[2:18:08] much affliction see they were coming
[2:18:11] under under fire because of what they
[2:18:15] believed you feel like you will your
[2:18:20] world's turned upside down you know why
[2:18:22] because of what you believe it's true I
[2:18:29] thought life was bad well how's that

[2:19:43] was was that that in the season see
[2:19:48] seasons change faces change see that was
[2:19:53] just the present-day condition they were
[2:19:56] being affected and Paul was concerned so
[2:19:59] much he said oh I just wonder how to
[2:20:00] church doing I've had him brothers doing
[2:20:02] I can't see him at night like that I
[2:20:04] dropped down some Douglas and they

[2:20:17] right it was just a season when they
[2:20:21] were being afflicted but God but God was

[2:25:34] people crumble under pressure right when
[2:25:38] things start getting hard we stop

[2:25:43] prophet of God told about a young man he
[2:25:45] was a Catholic boy he had a little
[2:25:47] prayer book had no real relation to God
[2:25:50] see that's why it's so important seat so

[2:27:03] flesh arm yourself likewise we start we
[2:27:06] start going through and suffering see

[2:35:12] dang what I'm saying but it's a whole
[2:35:14] lot of folk should still be a church

[2:35:22] in church right come on come on amen
[2:35:27] outside of certain ones my mother-in-law

[2:36:26] little more dignified give me this thing

[2:36:36] want to a hand hell of pin oh no I don't
[2:36:39] give me a hand here I'll be standing on
[2:36:40] stuff I'd be going crazy what's the
[2:36:44] truth I told her I made a statement I
[2:36:47] told him I said listener taste something
[2:36:48] man church should be full up with family
[2:36:53] so burnin know what I'm talking about
[2:36:55] when I went the piece was I the church
[2:36:58] was built on families scripturally it
[2:37:03] was Israel the sons of Israel and their
[2:37:08] family
[2:37:09] all up in order up under the leaders
[2:37:13] amen the matriarch s-- and the
[2:37:16] patriarchs of those families not we got
[2:37:20] things broke all up and everybody I mean
[2:37:23] if you moved out of state or you know
[2:37:25] married out of state I understand that
[2:37:27] right but but when when you got folk
[2:37:32] families stat this one over here and
[2:37:35] that one over there and so what you said
[2:37:40] you're disrespected the revelation of
[2:37:44] the matriarch and the patriarch see when
[2:37:51] I look at my people a lot help us it's
[2:37:56] like see if we was up on the Old
[2:38:01] Testament time right there revelation
[2:38:05] could never supersede my revelation see
[2:38:14] don't those hands and those tribes came
[2:38:17] together everything followed up under
[2:38:20] those different banners see when the
[2:38:24] hundred and forty-four thousand come in
[2:38:26] that's what it's gonna be
[2:38:27] they might not know what better day upon
[2:38:29] the now but they will one day that's the
[2:38:34] prophet said that a lot of those that
[2:38:37] stuff will be been lost through the wars
[2:38:40] in history but I believe that if this is
[2:38:45] Bible truth if what we believe is on the
[2:38:48] word and not the words of a man right
[2:38:51] then our sons and our daughters should
[2:38:54] be a man following the matriarch and the
[2:38:57] patriarchs of other families come on
[2:39:01] y'all children should be and your
[2:39:05] grandchildren should be up in here it
[2:39:07] should be no room in this building this
[2:39:09] morning
[2:39:11] supposed to be open down I know y'all
[2:39:20] got a lot of folk chillin and
[2:39:23] grandchildren see you see how messed up
[2:39:27] we are it's the truth
[2:39:29] a man who talked to me I'd be like
[2:39:33] listen I'm the wrong person to talk to
[2:39:35] come liable to hurt your feelings
[2:39:37] there's God no intervene you kind of you
[2:39:39] cuz you can't come to me with stupid
[2:39:42] right all of this feelings and emotions
[2:39:44] I'm not the one for that especially not
[2:39:47] in this season right hey man
[2:39:52] all of brother Jack's brothers nieces
[2:39:58] everybody right sister that's the
[2:40:02] matriarch right Jack the pastor Vaughn
[2:40:08] his children cannot believe this his
[2:40:12] truth I believe brother Jack is
[2:40:15] preaching truth in the indication is
[2:40:18] mama Hill huh my children shouldn't be
[2:40:24] running all over the country I'm trying
[2:40:39] to show us up I'm trying to show people
[2:40:42] need to understand what's the order of
[2:40:44] God right come on if we spiritual Israel
[2:40:50] right
[2:40:52] if we spiritual Israel it shouldn't be
[2:40:56] broke up if we if we got families this
[2:40:59] like I say it families you know
[2:41:01] sometimes we got family members all over
[2:41:03] the place where we know that's hard
[2:41:04] that's difficult
[2:41:05] I'm to my immediate family you know in
[2:41:09] the area right and listen and this is
[2:41:13] truth this is work we should encourage
[2:41:16] them we should we should encourage them
[2:41:19] live such a life that it influenced her
[2:41:23] right I appreciate I appreciate seeing
[2:41:26] you know sister Browns
[2:41:28] sisters and a daughter and granddaughter
[2:41:31] and that's the way it's supposed to be
[2:41:34] that's the way it's supposed to be yeah
[2:41:37] right
[2:41:38] I mean noise sister Brown long time I've
[2:41:44] been knowing her sister's probably
[2:41:47] longer than I've been knowing her since

[2:49:07] hand because I was on the passenger side
[2:49:09] was cut up his left hand because he was
[2:49:12] driving was cut up that was that we
[2:49:13] walked out of there and ever since then
[2:49:17] ever since then even before Jack started
[2:49:22] preaching we've been tight they just get
[2:49:25] mad at Foley we got married got our
[2:49:31] people
[2:49:32] Foley's the fuss at us about everything
[2:49:35] and since he's had a church we've been
[2:49:39] supportive of each other's ministries
[2:49:41] and we work together good folk want us
[2:49:47] to come but that you're much behind it

[2:54:44] [Applause]
[2:54:46] certainly appreciate rather smiley
[2:54:50] standing under the season of affliction
[2:54:54] and I think he'd be really good you go
[2:54:57] back home and and look at the scripture
[2:54:59] that he read to us today
[2:55:02] 1st Thessalonians 3 verse 1 through 13
[2:55:05] very short chapter 13 verses but go back
[2:55:09] and read that and then think about some
[2:55:11] of the things that he spoke here today
[2:55:13] you'll see how the Lord was just just
[2:55:15] really piecing it all together I'm very
[2:55:18] very grateful for how God uses his
[2:55:22] ministry a man just just just just so
[2:55:26] much in there
[2:55:29] [Music]
[2:55:31] he was talking about Spurgeon and I had
[2:55:35] the opportunity when I went to to
[2:55:38] England this time we were randomly we
[2:55:42] just kind of found this place that we
[2:55:43] wanted to stay in
[2:55:45] at all for the Quentin research that
[2:55:48] found them found this place in weed you
[2:55:49] know just stayed there one night I was
[2:55:51] telling some brothers I want to go to a
[2:55:53] particular church that I wanted to see
[2:55:55] and on the way there to say hey Spurgeon
[2:55:58] churches over here I'm like Spurgeon
[2:55:59] Church and they said yes it's right here
[2:56:03] in this area where you went I'm saying
[2:56:04] take me this virgin Church and big old
[2:56:08] building
[2:56:09] they say it's Purdy used to preach then
[2:56:11] I think they said fifteen thousand
[2:56:13] people used to pass through this church
[2:56:16] on a Sunday morning and and if you if
[2:56:19] you if you don't if you've never heard
[2:56:21] him at Charles Spurgeon you'd go in you
[2:56:24] read some of the things I said that this
[2:56:25] man had a revelation of the word in his
[2:56:28] Dana he wasn't a message or anything
[2:56:29] like that
[2:56:30] but they live so close to scripture
[2:56:33] right some of the things that they wrote
[2:56:35] during that time you just read on today
[2:56:37] is like oh my if even if the modern
[2:56:42] denomination Church would try to quote
[2:56:45] Spurgeon it might not even be received
[2:56:49] [Music]
[2:56:50] that's I mean that's how close this man
[2:56:52] was to door the modern the
[2:56:55] denominational war and let me also put
[2:56:58] it this way because they use this term
[2:56:59] we non-denominational they still have
[2:57:02] you tried the cool spur to the near
[2:57:03] church they probably still will receive
[2:57:05] it because that's how close he was right
[2:57:07] to scripture walking in the truth that
[2:57:09] he had and that day brother Branham
[2:57:11] talked about him as well but but I just
[2:57:13] love that you know I didn't get the
[2:57:14] whole quote I think I just got a little
[2:57:15] piece of it a man it reflects upon them
[2:57:19] not the message so just because he
[2:57:21] rejected you know I reflect upon you not
[2:57:23] the message don't mean the message run
[2:57:25] right a man might mean that you're not
[2:57:27] rights we thank God for the word today
[2:57:31] praise the Lord let's give God a hand
[2:57:34] the phrase amen also quickly to brother
[2:57:39] Felix that put in a prayer request with
[2:57:41] some Jacob we got that on on Wednesday
[2:57:46] night I believe it was he was having
[2:57:48] surgery on Thursday at the Miami
[2:57:51] Children's Hospital and I got work back
[2:57:53] from him that Jacob came through the
[2:57:55] surgery just fine
[2:57:57] we're certainly appreciative of
[2:58:00] everybody's prayers for him and so just
[2:58:03] continue to keep them in prayer a man
[2:58:05] that he'll just recover just a way that
[2:58:08] he needs to we'll have a word of Prayer
