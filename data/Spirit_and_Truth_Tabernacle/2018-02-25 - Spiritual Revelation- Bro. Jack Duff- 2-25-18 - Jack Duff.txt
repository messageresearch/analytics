in his house under expectation a man on today just wanted to thank the Lord arian Parham god bless you so good to have you with us on a date invited by brother Jerry Jordan Clemmons is that alright brother Jerry god bless you so did I ever a man on today I got a visitor's card she visited I looked down and saw that just the cameras name was here something struck me and I just saw else is the discernment that I'm gonna preach today I actually preached it a number of years ago it's just a killer you were here when I preached it and so I have a feeling named God want you to hear something so we're just gonna be obedient to the Lord Jesus I got a real strange memory like that a lot a lot of things and I remember you know there's just little special moments and things like that happened just follow a man the the Spirit of the Lord and I just know God's at work and I know that much I know is that work and he you don't make my mistake in anything that he does I mean I sincerely believe that Amen how many love the Lord praise the lord I thank you for the specials that we're forth um today I certainly appreciate you all we all heard it announcements for tonight we have chemical problems also I forgot to announce about their combined service but that is happening tonight and for the genes another thing that I think we missed that we need to start talking about is our dam defense Daniel Fast and I don't know the exact date that we don't get started on that March 10th okay as a church we were usually in turn two amen this time of fasting for 21 days just before instead think will be breaking the fast right and Good Friday so we we've you know just something that ice I heard about some years ago and just started doing it and you know typically it's fasting fasting typically involves the food and things of that nature but then you fast it does allow you to eat it just you don't eat what you normally eat right and it's no meats no sweets and you don't drink anything but water for 21 days and I tell you what it does your body real good to go through a cleansing like that but but most more importantly is just spiritually we're trying to draw closer to the Lord and now there are you know a number of ways to think through that time will be you know having our home our weekly prayers and things that nature and often us a time if you just get something on your heart during that time of fasting prayer I believe God is able to answer your request a man I believe God is able to beat you and not only that we we live in a society today it's a man where you know back in the Bible days they fast it's probably just be food but today we have so many things we probably need to fast from you may not just food technology really get all footage right but uh but you know we ask that you know try to farm some things that you can just disconnect from some might not be able to do food a man because of health reasons but this actually does let you do food is just a special diet that we're going for 21 days and you know but if you can fasten technology if you confess you know just a lot of things that just even games video games hello somebody right it's a lot of stuff we could Vance just 21 days just give it up actually you know what there's there's something that says if you do something but 21 days typically it becomes a habit alright it can become a habit to you if you just if you get if you get it for 21 days so it could be a habitual lifestyle you know some of us might go off our medication if we can change our volume well praise the Lord hey man I know I know we won't immediate healing God's able to do that we've seen them do it but sometimes God healed through just your diet hey man right but but there's a number of things a man that we could we could we could give up and and some of us free we see well you know what I'm gonna just give up technology but I'm gonna keep eating when I use that's what you did last year I want you to do something different this year a man church praise God we got to stop being weak Christians hello somebody hey BAM you know you know we got to be able to do something sometimes for the Lord so I want to encourage to church a man to to get involved in the Daniel fast will be starting on March 10th amen and kind of bringing it right up into right up until Easter time so just keep that in mind amen certainly keep that in mind all right I'm not going to take any more time amen thank y'all missions appreciate you all good to have sus to come back on a horn a man Lord touch our body a man good to have it back at the clarinet a man so I'm gonna read two scriptures and there is a number of different directions that we can go here today but I'm just praying that God would just direct us a man and and and and how we bring this out but I want to read from first Corinthians chapter 12 and also Matthew 16 a man god bless you everyone standing that can of stand as we read the word the Lord amen 1st Corinthians chapter 12 just reading one verse from here a man that will be verse 3 and it reads as as follows it says wherefore I give you to understand that no man speaking by the Spirit of God calleth jesus accursed and that no man can say that jesus is the lord but by the holy ghost and man no man called them jesus Kurtz and no man say that Jesus is the lord but by the holy ghost turn with me also that the Matthew 16 very familiar passage glory to God oh god help us a man Matthew 16 starting to verse 13 Jesus came into the coasts of Caesarea Philippi the yaksas disciples saying whom do men say that I the Son of Man and they said some say that thou art John the Baptist some Elijah and others Jeremiah or one of the prophets you saith unto them but whom say ye that I am and Simon Peter answered and said thou art the Christ the Son of the Living God and jesus answered and said unto him blessed art thou simon barjona the flesh and blood have not revealed it unto thee but my father which is in heaven and I say also unto thee that thou art Peter and upon this rock I will build my church and the gates of Hell shall not prevail against him and I will give unto thee the keys of the kingdom of heaven and whatsoever thou shalt bind on earth shall be bound in heaven and whatsoever thou shalt loose on earth shall be loosed in heaven then charge Lea's disciples that they should tell no man that he was Jesus the Christ a man the Lord had a blessing to the reading of his word let's just bow and a brief word of Prayer father we are certainly appreciative of the opportunity we have to read the word God I'm praying that it would it would that your spirit would make the work clear to us it is important Lord that we catch what the Holy Spirit is trying to say to us in this hour things are happening very fast and God if we're not spiritual we will miss what is going on so Lord my prayer is that you'd help us all to get out of the way help us to surrender our thoughts and that God you would just take complete control over this portion of the service we bind every spirit that is against the Spirit of God and we lose the Holy Ghost to have its way even right now in our midst this in Jesus name we pray amen amen you can be seated I took this title a number of years ago and and I'm I want to take it again it's titled spiritual revelation spiritual revelation and just bear with me that there's a lot here that that's in my heart and I want to try to slow down and get it all out if I can but just bear with me let's start with this quote a man out of the revelation of Jesus Christ and and I want you to just try to follow these words a man try to follow these words as I read them from God's prophet it's going to be important to you a man spiritually I'm in paragraph 13 - 4 and the revelation of Jesus Christ says the importance of revelation by the spirit to a true believer can never be over emphasized amen the importance of revelation by the spirit first of all you need to understand that revelation can only come by the spirit I can sit and talk with you til I'm blue in the face I could spend all night with you going from one verse to the next verse to the next verse from Genesis to Revelation I can try to show you Jesus right but but but you're not going to actually catch that until the Spirit of God gives it to you hallelujah if there's anything you should pray for it should be revelation right amen Revan and praying and asking God for a new car I know you need one rather than asking them for a new house I know you need one you might need an apartment rather than bringing and only asking god I want to use that word again only asking God for material blessings you need to stop and ask God for revelation extremely important that you get revelation and understanding as to who Christ is not who he whoops not who he will be but who he is right now you need to know who Jesus is come on somebody right right you know you know I was used to have this little this little thing amen and they still have it I'm just coming to my mind fresh this this guy Waldo and they would have this little picture a man on the on the front of the book and they would show you a picture of Waldo and where Aldo would have a maybe a red hat and his shoes would be black and then you have maybe a blue scarf right and there's some stripes on or something like that and then you have to turn the page and you got to find a man the guy in the in the midst of all this sea of people you got to find the guy with the red hat and the blue scarf a man in the strike zone and the black shoes because you get you start looking at these different men guys they look like Waldo but the only thing missing is that you know he don't have the blue scarf come on this one have a white scarf oh and if you got a white scarf on that's not Waldo huh that guy is imitating Waldo are you with me he's imitating Waldo but that's not Waldo you can't get your eyes focused on somebody imitating a man we want the real thing hey Lia and there's many churches better in the land that they ever pay Christianity but you not looking for imitation you want the real back somebody that's gonna tell you the truth whether hurt you I'm not their main focus is to get you to heaven but you got to you got to find Waldo right you got to find Waldo because there's many imitators out there and when you looking at you got to look real close if there's minute at a circle all going you're going you're circumcised Valle de right hand and then you look at it and you look at the front of the book and then you look at the big thing that's just circling Waldo but he's on the page he's on the page you just gotta find them he might be hiding behind something but you gotta find Waldo he might have one shoe out there but that good that black shoe that go that red hat that go that blue scarf that go this price there's Waldo and you know the deeper you get into the book the deeper you the more you keep turning the pages the harder it is to find Waldo seeing the first 13 it might have been easy in the second search ancient matter if it easy but when you get down to the seven church it become difficult to find Waldo but he's dead and you can't do the necklace but 3x god help me to find who Aldo is help me to find the truth because the Bible say you know the truth and the truth will make you free hallelujah but this happens through spiritual revelation the importance that I'm going back to the quote the importance of revelation by the spirit I mean mama can't explain this daddy can't explain this past the can't explain this but the Spirit of God can so the importance of revelation by the spirit to a true believer can never be over emphasized listen revelation means more to you than perhaps you realize now I am NOT talking about this book of Revelation and you I am talking about all revelation it is tremendously important to the church do you remember in Matthew 16 where Jesus asked the disciples this question who do men say that I the Son of Man am lord help us and then some say thou art John the Baptist some Elias and others Jeremias or one of the prophets now now now that what you need to get there is that there were many opinions in the land in that day as to who Jesus was and let me tell you this many opinions in the land today as the way is right now and how he is using his service yes God didn't use Billy Graham a great servant of God a man a mighty servant of God God used to me out of their unique ministry and I can point it out to you in the scripture how God used both Billy Graham and/or Roberts hallelujah the Prophet told us Oh Lord I'm oh I'm Way ahead of myself gods when the Prophet told us that you know when we look at the name Abraham his name was Abram and then it was changed to Abraham and what God did was give Abraham a part of his own name because he was hello him and he gave Abraham a part of his own name put some letters in Abraham's name it had to be pronounced different now no longer Abram but Abraham came of a partner's own name now he st. said now what happened back in that time in Abraham's time Abraham had a bit three visitors come down God and two angels and those two ages come down and they begin to fellowship with Abraham the fellowship was Herod and there they were sitting in inhabited a little meal at a tent there now first of all if you go back and read the Bible the chapter before his name was April and in this chapter with God steps in they have Abraham's tip he says we're sterile I wife because the chapter before her name was Surratt now how did this visitor with his back turn to the tip say where is Sarah not so right but Sarah I need you to understand they have not they have not either made it to the courthouse yet courthouse yet to get their name change however this visitor knew the name Sarah in the name Abraham because the visitor was none other than God himself in the flesh of man coming to visit Abraham and Sarah to make his promise come to pass today now you said but the two angels and him they sit in the godom two angel sitting there visiting talking and eating and and you know this is one of the reasons why praise the Lord I know in the Daniel fast will not gonna eat me but I'm not going to that kind of diet for the rest of my life I eat meat and the reason I eat meat because God ate meat he ain't meat he had a calf right they kill the calf and they fed that to God God ate meat hallelujah so I can eat meat hello somebody glory to God hey man but up but you know here here here they're sitting there and they're eating him and he begin to reveal the secrets and everything but but before you know he sit for two angels he stayed back with Abraham Oh God he stayed back with Abraham and then he sent the two angels over a man insane I ain't going down the Sodom and he'd been given revealed to Abraham what was getting ready to happen in Sodom before destruction came to Sodom somebody had a revelation on the earth and here today that for destruction is the United States of America before destruction is the entire world God got some people on the earth with an understanding as to what's gonna what's getting ready to happen and if I get let's break it down this way these people have spiritual revelation oh my gosh but as the problem since beginning to share these things with you know what Abraham me said you say now I heard about the sinning son I heard about the sin and Gomorrah I'm hearing the saying did this sin is reaching all the way to heaven and I've come down and I got two angels from these angels to call investigating angels of judgment hallelujah stay with me and say that say here these two angels come down as he Festa gave me angel judgment I'm sitting them down into Sodom to see if it's really happening in Sodom like they say it's happened and you know what was going on the side of homosexuality out of all time huh praise the Lord and tell me it's not there again jesus said as it was in the days of lot so shall it be in the coming of the Son of man so here we see the same conditions in life stay out of same conditions today we know judgment is on the way because of the sin of the people hallelujah i'ma just i'ma just say these things I might be the only preacher in the city center how you gonna go to church sit in the pew and be a homosexual couple and feel comfortable in the house of God how that's come happening in God's church I just saw two women sitting there hugged up on each other in the house of God sodomized to come to church and feel comfortable something is wrong somewhere we got shot on my chin the pulpit yell about the pulpit somebody need to shut that church yeah i'ma just say this see when they let women get in the pulpit that's what opened up the door to these sodomite spirits that were in the Bible it ain't in the Word of God where you see these things but when we start seeing it that oughtta let us know something wrong somewhere now we and many of us as believers we can we know stuff wrong with that that's why we start looking for something else we know something wrong with it but in order to receive right you gonna have to change what you're doing you just can't get part of God you have to take all of it and the only way you can take all of God is you've got to have spiritual revelation hallelujah if God give it to me he can give it to you all right let me let me go a little further with this cuz I know I'm not there yet I'm going back to my mother I ain't finished with this Abraham and Sarah so here here God revealing to Abraham it says they going down the investigation Sodom and Gomorrah because I'm about to destroy this place because of the sin and the homosexuality was just just ridiculous one other things that God's prophet told us about you know that that times that there would be a lot of buying and selling hey you know he said he said I won't have time to read all this but I got if you ever need it I can show it to you where he said he says it's like when you go out and buy refrigerator and now this year you bought the refrigerator you paid so much money for it but next year they come up with a new model and your old model you feel like it ain't worth nothing no more so you just you just run out then you buy another one right or if you the Lord bless you got a new car but next year they changed something with the lights and since it don't look like your car a man you put yourself in debt trying to keep up with the Joneses going to get another car you see saying he say when you see that that's a sign of the time that's a sign of in time when people do that and sometime it might not be a couple I mean ha ha ha Apple got people paying $1000 for a telephone I mean and I'm achieve when i dial your number you know it's gonna do ring that's all this gum do is ring and you gonna pick up and say hello and I'm gonna say hello why does it cost $1,000 to do that and not only that Amen now now you know because you know they're gonna think I changed one loose feature and then that and I'm selling all over till you give them another thousand dollars and because you wanna Apple it's just a phone it's not an apple it's a phone you can't even talk with an apple you talk with a phone stop around the devil to get y'all and get with this nonsense when they showed me a phone here say how much is that it cost me how much to change only two dollars give it to me I ain't got it ain't gotta pay they say I give me that one well you're gonna have less I just take less memory can it make phone calls all right glory to God but that's a sign of time he would get caught up in all this one that you know keep up with it that's a sign at a time praise look when you look around and see all this building of developments that's another sign of the time right you can see all the natural sounds but keep your spiritual signs as well Lord help me I'm trying to come back to this keep your eyes eight men on the spiritual things as well because God is moving so when he sends Abraham II say his destiny since they were Abraham and he's talking and and he sends the other two angels down a man into Sodom and Gomorrah and they have a job to go down and investigate what's going on inside him what's going on and Gomorrah amen before destruction comes let me let me let me just put it's way before destruction happens God sends messenger and I and I got it the church natural receive the messenger the church spiritual also receive the message I'm talking about two churches glory to God I hope y'all can stay with me even here in the Bible saying the book of Revelation to him that have the ear let him hear what the Spirit says unto the churches that means there's a church spiritual a church natural a church true and a church false but they all their Oh God can't can he can y'all just bear with me can y'all be are y'all still with me I ain't forgot about my thought I just got to drop some things here and there glory now I told you there's a church natural and a church spiritual you got to find church spiritual church spirits just moving by spiritual revelation right so now now the reason that they're both churches the reason that we consider them churches and now we can send them all Christians oh my the church down the street got Christmas in it the church next door got Christians in this church got Christians in it this church also got non-christians in it this church got three kind of believers in it some true believers some make-believe us and then some unbelievers learn in that scenario churchyard so who you are cuz a tree got me no but it's true glory to God alright so so here we got these things going on but but the reasons that we call them our Christians and this where this where we get back to that Waldo conversation this way I get a little confused because they they all churches well did not stand on the word of dark can you really call them a church if you found waiting off one bit you need to get out of there because one word oh you're hanging over hell now the reason the reason that we called it they're all churches because you have what we call or we call them our Christians because you have these two different types you have Christians of the Spirit that you have Christians of the flesh Oh y'all bear with me I forgot my phone I'm coming back little Lord just it just helped me to bring it all together but you got creatures of the Spirit and krystal depression the reason that it gets so confusing because sometimes you got your eyes on a Christian of the flesh and you might think that their Christian of the Spirit but they're not because they can't go all the way with the word they don't have true relation now-now-now the prophet actually tells us something here and I'm gonna I'm gonna stop and read this when this is our thoughts here in church age I'm in our paragraph 226 paragraph 1 I'm going back to to Abraham and Sarah and them them to angels just this y'all don't forget that that's well that's where I was because I'm I'm getting a little old and sometimes I forget so y'all don't forget hey man y'all can tell me where I was not get back over there I want to read this back here in Turkey I'm trying to help you understand who Waldo Waldo is who Christ it hey man listen he says this in fact here in church age he says now why does God call these churches his churches even though they are the false vine I'm in 226 paragraph 1 he says that the truth of the matter is that they are Christians but they are not Christians of the spirits they are Christians of the flesh listen they are bearing the name in vain mark 7 7 howbeit in vain do they worship Me teaching for doctrines the commandments of men but indeed they are Christians for what else could they be that Christians what else maybe is a that is his religion no matter how he lives it because he subscribes in theory to what the Quran teaches in the same way a Christian is a Christian as long as he subscribes to the fact that Jesus is the Son of God born of a virgin was crucified and died and rose again then he is the savior of mankind etc in fact in the latest in age which is the age in which we live in it right now in the latest in age there will be those who call themselves Christians because they subscribe to the fine qualities of Jesus while reserving to themselves the right to deny his deity Christian scientists have done that already as well as multitudes who preach a social gospel now when I just started talk about homosexuality a man in the pulpit that man a social gospel that's what that that's that's the type of sermon that the only place I can preach is right here I'm not going to invite get invited to no church to say that they will kick me out of there oh my god the truth is still the truth no matter where we got our I'm glad God gave me some place I can see it and be free to sing Amen glory guy says preach it they said and in multitude who would breach a social gospel let me else we'll just drop in it social gospel is the one that tell you're gonna get rich by tomorrow they were they a blessing plan and you know we go to church we want somebody to prop us all of us you know you you uh one time my sister went to the fair and there was a lady out there reading crystal balls and she saw my sister walked by she began to say hey you got this going on you got that going on you got this going on you got that going on that lady told her exactly what was going on I like this she was she was right we all look the same now that they didn't even confess Christianity but she was dead right you know that was a gift and gifts and callings are without repentance so anybody can have that kind of gift we're not looking for that but you know but church don't become that but everybody just walked onward from I'm giving it to you I'm giving you the word from the Lord I'm reading to you at the Bible that's your word from the Lord right but but everybody looked at this type of stuff when they go to church we want to be entertained we got the music got to be just right and you know and it come on y'all worship with me come on and worship with come on everybody come on come on wave your hand and I got to do that every time you come to church you missing the reason while you're in church you out you'll need nobody to tell you to worship you already got that only inside of you and I'ma tell you saying something anointed then we will worship you know we got all this lunch that's going on in church a lot of nonsense a lot of nonsense and people people don't understand that they missing true revelation right God not God not coming just to entertain people he's trying to get something into your spirit let me stay witness I'm trying to show you that there's there's these two groups that you need to just kind of be watchful of two groups all right sorry says Christian Sciences have done that already as well as multitudes of preach the social gospel he is a nominal Christian and belongs to the church but he is not a true or spiritual believer that kind of believers one who is I was I've been baptized into the body of Christ and as a member of him but nonetheless it is in God's order that the tears grow up with the wheat and they are not to be uprooted that is the command of God their day for binding and burning is coming but not yet now I'm using that and if you always just let me y'all bear with me here I want to drop these things off I'm getting back over here - what happened with Abraham and Sarah but I need to drop off a couple of things so you can get some spiritual revelation Lord help us lord help us I want to read I want to read something else amen this is out of why other people so tossed about I want to try to help us if I can glory to God now yes these are Christians and yes they're Christians but what's the difference some are operating under spiritual revelation or what we would call they're they're Christians of the spirit not Christians of the flesh glory to God amen anybody can believe Jesus died for this is anybody can do that and like we heard last week God so loved the world that He gave His only begotten Son but the question is what world what world it God loves it's not the were you thinking that he loved because he said he said he hate the world and the things not the world so how you gonna love the world and hate the world at the same time we need to know which were all he talking about Loreena God hey man we don't misuse the scripture we already got God trying to bring us back to truth though hearing this this message while the people still talks about listeners now speaking this there is two different types of Christianity's oh look at that two different types of Christianity seem strange but I would not say two different types I say two different phases would be a better word to use not two types two phases the same Christianity but two phases of it and one of them is an intellectual or mental conception of what God has said in his word and of Jesus Christ by the way of knowledge and alright I mean why other people so tossed about he says and the other is an experimental experience that God has given the man in his heart the one intellectually is a hungry he is he's a piece of young God his feast doesn't hold out oh my lord he's feast young God but his piece doesn't hold out what is he trying to say that you know you can go to church amen and get a little blessing glory to God and let me tell you something yes it is the same Holy Ghost that were falling here that will fall in any other Church it's the same exact Holy Ghost right you can get a little blessing you think man God is in this but for some reason the blessing don't hold out who you at some point in time that blessing prior right and you're going looking for something else and reason you're looking for something else because there is something else for you to have if there's a deeper you calling out to the deep the children has a deep to respond to that cry now listen says the one intellectually is a hunger and he's a feasted on God but his feasts don't hold out the other one seems to have victory all the time I like Christians like that victory all the time there's nothing bothers them they're just as solid and anchored as they can be no trials no storms bothers them at all but they seem to have something about them that people who are Christians are trying to live forgot admire that type of Christian and that's the type of Christian you want to be and I've often wondered Lord what is it that that these people have that others crave so much for and yet seem to fail to get it so what he's trying to tell us here now there is there's two different types a men are two different phases of Christians you have you have something that's approaching God with an intellectual conception and then others have a true revelation of who he is now I'm going on I'm gonna read a little bit more I want to read from the message to the 3rd Exodus amen the 3rd Exodus I'm trying to get you to see that there's a difference in and what you see that the true spiritual seed and then also amen and if I could just put it in and in that term Abraham had a spiritual seed and he had a natural seat right so we got we got to kind of catch the spiritual seed and what God's doing specifically job is experience and they that worship Him must worship Him in spirit and truth we trying to approach it naturally but God can't be approached that way it's got to be spiritually you got to have spiritual revelation only the father can give you that that's this one out of third Exodus stay with me here God had Moses to be prophet and though he had already prophesied and it proved that he was right but yet he was in the school of wilderness hid away from the rest of the world but he was school being trained out in the wilderness the enemies were proposed always his system and unbelief will accept because the enemy is the intellectual side so now remember there's only two don't forget this there's only two powers one is spiritual power of the Holy Spirit the other is the devil working through intellectual power so you have to balance one is spiritual power of the Holy Spirit and the other one is the devil working through intellectual power since but then that's where he entered in the Garden of Eden through intellectual powers to make you believe in intellectual conception against the word just as friends it can be the kids could get that see see and that's the way it's been all the way down I really want to take my time and break into that garden of eatin a man conditioner I'm just not gonna have time today I already feel like I'm have to come back and preach this in two parts but I but whatever the main thing that I'm trying to get you to see if I can just just just just drive this point home when you're looking for Christ you're gonna have to catch it spiritually right I mean even today all the way back in that time they had to catch things spiritually a man when they say who do men say I am they had to catch them spiritually and today we gotta have to be we gotta catch it spiritually it's not because somebody sat down and share these things with you God gotta open up your understanding in order for him to open up your understanding you need to be in a place where he can do that you you can't be feasting on false and expect God to open up something real to you now he can't do that he can't do that but but but if you already know that there's a difference why not give everything you got to what's real just for a little bit Trilok for a little bit why not give everything you got what I mean by that come to church on Wednesday night come to church on Friday night I mean when you're really seeking God should go through great extremes to find him I mean it's not just a Sunday morning thing here I mean anytime the church doors open I'm seeking God for more revelation I want to be there to hear what God got to say to me give God everything you got just for a little bit let me go on now hallelujah get on back over here to Abraham Sarah these three angels God and two angels come down and God's in the two angels away and tells Abraham they're on their way to Sodom they're on the way to Gomorrah and they're going down to check out what's going on down there in this land because you know the stands are reaching heaven and and I can't allow I cannot allow people to live on my the Earth's thinning like that I'm gonna have to destroy these people off the face of the earth so Abraham when God told him exactly that he was going to you going where Lord and say they're going to Sodom and they're going to Gomorrah so Abraham being outside the city glory to God because that's where we Christians live outside the things of the world hello we don't do what the world does we Christians we don't go to the places that the world goes we Christians we don't drink like the world drink we Christians we don't dress like the world's rest we Christians we don't look like the world look we Christians so here you know here here Abraham sitting out there and God reveals to him say now and notice the spirits revelation came to Abraham light didn't even know what was giving than half the light down there having a good time partying up something glory to God he just pardon up something and his wife just so wrapped up in her society and got all her friends if I can just put it this way she got so many followers she got so many followers and and do you realize that because you got something that followers you become a slave to the followers you got to keep producing content you become a slave to it because you got so and everybody looking for you to do some you become a slave to it because you've got so many followers if you just get offline Chester look everybody where you at what happened to you I'm fasting Abraham is sitting there with God in the tent it was god of two angels and Abraham sitting there and God beginning some said now they're going down there they going down to destroy a lot had no idea that destruction was coming but here in God's grace I'm not even kind of talked about there's this I hope you can follow me there's two scenes going on there's one theme in Sodom and there's another scene with Abraham but God is working in both areas all glory to God so here we have here we have God amen moving with Abraham and revealing Abraham giving them spiritual revelation of the things that's get ready to happen and when Abraham captures it by revelation saying I keep going away they go away they're going down on the stopped Abraham say oh we say they're gonna destroy it they if you know we if we find out that they're doing down there what we heard that it's going to be the trucks Abraham say real quick he got in the prayer mode it's a long curved engine there be 50 in Sodom you know 50 righteous say where to destroy the whole city you got 50 righteous people on that he said no I won't destroy if I can find 50 righteous they ran say okay what if it's lacking five and you got forty five righteous will you destroy the city of your final 40 messing on no no I wonder struggle around forty five say okay Lord I don't get upset with me but what about 30 he was back in 20 and you find 39 with you with your destruction say no i won't i won't this rope I can find 30 okay God now I know I've been I'm overstepping my you know my space here what about 20 if I find swinging righteous you got my promise that I will not destroy that place Abraham so Abraham just thinking in his mind cuz they knew he knew what was going on down in that city but he also knew that he had relatives down there I heard somebody tell me yesterday the family first family first no matter what family first hallelujah I like that I said I'm gonna use that family first no matter what family first glory to God right so here Abraham got it in his mind family first and he said he said he said now I'm trying to count them out I'm trying to calculate this thing I'm trying to figure this thing out you saying I know lightest down there no I know I know Lot's wife is down there and and not only that I know I know lots of children have gotten married now you know what Abraham knew that they was married and and I'm sure I'm sure Abraham probably told a lot a few things before his daughter's got in there to them people down there in Sodom hello somebody I'm sure Abraham spoke some things but yet Lots daughters went ahead and got married but the man that they married can I just be honest with y'all I'm telling y'all Bible the man that they've married we're men that we're not looking to get married to have real wives hallelujah these men had other intentions maybe it was because they got a good tax return they got they got they got other reasons why they getting married right but by here here they are here let's let's say uh they say uh Abraham said now I got lunch Lot's wife lots of two daughters their their spouses these things now maybe maybe maybe just maybe the people that that lot gave his daughter to maybe their parents I believe us - maybe you counted them folks I got ten so I said okay lord I know you said 20 what if it's only ten righteous it said if I could find ten I won't try to get this and a city probably larger than West Palm Beach God could not find ten folk living right 10 10 we got more than ten in the church today and if this was in Jesus right now as it was in the days of life so shall it be in the coming of the Son of Man Willy farm 10 I stand would be one of them I'm gonna be one of them and and and here here's the things that I love about this this particular passage of Scripture is that before I mean even though Abraham did not actually ask God for life God knew what his prayer was and he went down there and pull a lot and his daughters and his wife out now you know you go back and read Genesis 19 lot tried to get his son-in-law to come but they couldn't it wouldn't come it was so it was so bad in that city that when the angel showed up the men of the city wanted to sexually get to know the angels that's how bad it was in that city that they would go after angels these men was so wicked that women didn't do anything for them anymore oh I might there you want to know why can I tell y'all why the women didn't do nothing for them do y'all want to know why the reasons that the women then do nothing for them anymore because the men had sought a woman's flesh so much that it stopped appealing to them they saw their flesh so much you know right now everybody trying to push this out and push it out I mean you you're doing so much that men don't even want it now you got women whistling at you that's how sad it was no glory to God I know anything about the troop and I go to church and see two women sitting up there hugged up from each other I know something wrong with this this this is this is Sodom and Gomorrah conditions in the house of God and I'm a and I know right and I thought wouldn't come to this church and do that I know it I know it they might they might start out might not know what type of church it is and then then after a little sermon like this you see their hands light down and then you see them we put a mark only on this I'll never go back to that church again but as as locked back by the grace of God got a visitation from two angels heavenly beings but yet still they had a designing heart where they wanted the things of the world each day now when y'all leave the city don't look back and hear Lot's wife when she turned she didn't turn physically it was in her heart that she turned she won it back and when she would turn it on heart she turned into a pillar of salt now I need you to understand what the Prophet told us about this and I'm bringing this I'm trying to bring this all the way back around what the Prophet told us say now when Abraham received a piece of elohim's named God's name himself when his name was changed from April to Abraham right he says now there was never of time in all history where God dealt with the world the way that he dealt Amen the way that he dealt back there in that time he said notice he changed Abraham's name he was a messenger I mean he received the messenger Abraham received message but also lot and the people of Sodom they received two messengers he said that's a tight for two modern messengers that went to them today the to modern messages for Oral Roberts and Billy Graham you say notice now Graham H am GRA H a.m. there's never been a man of God on the scene with that last name like that ending with h8m and God using the way he used Billy Graham oh there's never he said in all history God I can look at all the great revivals that happen there was never a time where God used the man with the last name ending in H am g ra h am is that what he said but spiritual revelation spiritual revelation Billy Graham and Oral Roberts went to church Stalin they pursued the church the Christians of the flesh if I can put it that way they they went to they went to a different group and they did a mighty work God used them just like he used the two angels damage in Genesis 19 but remember he said there was never time that God used a messenger with the name ended with H a.m. and gr8 h8m and they say he said now he went on to say a little further they say six letters and they stop there we say six letters why because it's gonna take spiritual revelation for you to catch something else there was two things happening yes God was dealing with the church out here but he's also dealing with this group over here where Abraham was now Abraham a B are a saint em seven letters 6 represents the number of men but 7 is a number of completion so in Abraham's tent God was revealing certain things Abraham that locked them had no idea what's happening so spirits revelation also tells us that God dealt with another man in this generation and his name also ended with H I am NOT just GRA H am Graham six letters but there was a man with seven letters and God used his ministry as well his name happen to be BR am H am seven letters Brenham take spiritual revelation to understand what God was doing over here with this group and what God was doing with that group and God was involved in both groups hallelujah here's the the significance behind this after the two angels went down into Sodom and they pull lot in his wife and his children out after they left now I'm gonna tell you was a hard time to get him out of there it was hard I mean they was a lingering just a lingual just I mean and I don't know maybe a lot really realizing and I ain't gonna be Mary anymore I lost my status here I haven't lost it and he said sit man you better start worried about your status you know some people will leave certain churches because they got a status you losing your soul over your status they receive lots stop lingering you got to get out of here and I mean thank you really happen right now you better leave now they say skate escape get to the mountains get get get out of here fastest pop good we can destroy this place you know when they were coming when the Sanders showed up at Lots house and he's me and Wonder yeah gather round houses bring us the men that came into the city today we we living in your house life bring them out bring us those men said mandate they surrounded the house these gave man I'm telling you just what the Bible said gay men surrounded the house and they said bring out we want to get to know them I mean can I just be honest can yo yo y'all like it wrong right can you imagine that they didn't even know these guys names they didn't even know their name but we're still interested in getting the bed winner and it's the same thing with with people that they they don't even know folk you just met him online and then come up with some lie how you know you've met that person on the line I had a friend of mine telling me one time I told his parents you met this lady and it's they say I've told my parents that I met her at the mall and what he did with the young lady say we're gonna meet at the mall we met online but we're gonna meet at the mall right and and and that way we can tell people we met at the mall then don't don't even know folk this is the type of spirit yo come on y'all see the stuff on Facebook Instagram everywhere you see it everywhere stand you - right here from the pulpit - that's the type of spirit that was in the land in that time don't even know nobody ain't even had no I mean you I mean you're you load a name you'll know where they come from you look they got a disease and not you'll know nothing well willing to lay down with them somebody say it's the truth any higher but here here that these these people doing this and they didn't did they surrounded the house and like bring out the man bring out the men that came to your house that they we know you got some visitors bringing them out we want to get to know them and when you read that in your Bible I'm telling you what it mean they want to get to know them sexually they want trying to get the hey bro how you doing what's your name guys don't do that if I don't know you I never met you before but I'm acknowledging what I do I'm trying to get to know you like that I don't know you like that come on tell you that mr. truth in high but but but this is the type of sin that was happening in the land in that day before God came down and destroyed and and I'm so so so not now of course when angels going down that investigate the city of course they know it's sin in the city if the men of the city coming after them man that's pretty bad I'm a visitor just stop there one night these people are all over me man he said you say he's a lot get on in here and and and if not that it had not the Angels blind at these men they would have broke broke the door down coming into Lots house to take them in it's a lot you got to get out of here now you can't stay in this city one more night stay with ya one more day you got to come out now get your stuff they probably have time to pack up nothing then have time to go back in and get their tambourine they had to leave immediately and God want us to leave some situations immediately and and like just being rushed out he's like now you get to the mounts and get as high as far as you can away from this but get out of it get out of here lot y'all gonna make me pull them into areas that I it's not in my notes but I'm just going in here get out like like trying to negotiate well can I just go this city look closer can I go over here no no you better get the way I told you so that's the same I ain't got time to go she ate with you ain't got time for this you want to do what you want to do go on and do whatever you want to do like I ain't got time for this well I'd say it lasted okay and they went on and and two things happened if I could just keep it in my head Lord bring it back to the first thing happened is that when they left destruction on Sodom and Gomorrah second thing happened that's TV that lot ended up there one no man there his daughters can I reach y'all go let me preach the Bible in here his daughters wanted to help God out they came up with a scheme now there's one thing that you know it was all that rushing to get out the city one thing they didn't forget was the liquor Christenson be drinking cuz Kristen should be hanging out we're folk drinking either I always said no the happy hour when I worked always I did not go to happy hour hey man ain't under behalf of that folk driving home drunk and somebody getting accident killed somebody and all over happy hour but here they didn't forget liquor hi how was it that night they get their daddy out there and wonder and they made my wife not here oh he just just all messed up messed up in his mind messed up messed up those daughter's current displaying cuz ain't see no man in this city at all and they say well you know what we we want to have children so our fathers name can go wrong I'm telling you what the Bible say it came with this plan you know what tonight we gonna get that a drunk and we get him drunk since I'm the oldest I'm gonna go in and be with daddy and I'm gonna get pregnant by daddy y'all know how people get pregnant that's what they did with a daddy and suddenly I'll say that's sick people doing it the day and God don't judge people for I mean I just heard something on the sub news report some father and daughter was separated for years I think he gave their daughter up for adoption something like that in some kind of way the girl got back in touch with her daddy and do you know I don't know how it happened but that man married his own daughter and had had had his Mama and Daddy at the ceremony they should have locked the whole family thumb now I don't know if he told his mom and daddy that's who he was married because people people had all kind of stuff from you but I don't know if he told him but that man got married to his own daughter and when the law found out it locked both the door then the daddy if they need to be locked up but this type of stuff is happening in our world today it's always on the news it's the days of Sodom Gomorrah you're this daughter come up with this plan I'm gonna get daddy drunk and I'm gonna get pregnant tonight daddy and the other sister sale keeps him out tomorrow night would be my turn what dad got daddy drunk the second time and Lotte has this relationship with his daughters that shows when you under the wrong influence see if they would have never been in Sodom their City I mean they started deducing Thanks it ain't as bad as what they doing in Sodom no God didn't like that either she was with Abraham that would've never happened but you didn't hear that kind of stuff going on Abraham's camp praise the Lord when it's time to get married Abraham when it's intently 0/5 somebody bring them back for my son but they didn't have them kind of problems in Abraham's camp a lot compromising always compromise and always compromise and always compromising and looking for the trouble it produced and lot gathers our own two daughters pregnant and i'ma tell you I don't think he was that drunk I know he won that drunk I know it I'm 100% sure I can prove it by the Bible life was not that drunk cuz we lookin Davis day when David got this other woman pregnant Bathsheba he called her husband off of the field I in the battle Uriah come on home and got the man drunk I said nah man you ain't got to be out there battling some man going down there in special town with your wife Uriah say nine going home say man the attention he just drunk he was drunk as I don't know what he was so drunk he fell asleep at Davis house they sent the man outside father's gonna go home because you don't drink and puts fear some somebody say it's the truth Amy hi they say not going down anyway flame man fell asleep right at Davis DOE and David no no I got me not that effect on the battlefield I can't go down there and have no pledge with my wife I gotta stay right here and get ready for the battle that's not light when that drunk cuz your Rio when that drunk either and he had good sense some people like to bling they talking on they drink no they've been want to say that all alone they using a drink to get it out the the thing that I need you to see is that spirits revelation is what Abraham had so that he could avoid what was given to happened down to Sodom and Gomorrah a lot didn't had that lot was what we would call a nominal believer and God loved him so much that he still brought him out before he destroyed it right and what God's trying to do is get people attention again that they just as I gave you as God had God Himself in two angels that went down in suffering the most time God did the same thing day God came down in the Ministry of William Branham and he used that ministry to get the bride's attention that's all the way not to exalt brother Branham but God was using his ministry if God could enter into a man's body and Abraham's time get God can enter into a man's body today it's still God oh just like he used Billy Graham in Oral Roberts he used brother Branham it was the same God using them all now I'll tell you what I'm gonna read one quote I got some other things here that I need to say to y'all and but it's gonna come at a later time I want to talk a little bit more about this spiritual revelation but here let me uh let me let me let me kind of find a way out of here today since you know Billy Graham we honor this great man of God God called him at ninety nine years old but like I told you before when when the angels left song destruction immediately came and I don't know what's going to happen here in our time but I know descriptions about to come we we are turning a spiritual corner and you better be ready to turn you better be ready to turn don't miss this church things are happening very fast I honor this man of God I went out and just found a couple quotes I'm coming coming home the last quote I'm gonna read is out of proving his word so just get that ready but before we before we say that I think that might be the last one I read but here just a couple quotes that I pulled from from Billy Graham Amen some things that he stated while he was here with us we thank God for this great man of God and man he made a statement says God proved his love on the cross when Christ hung and bled and died it was God saying to the world I love you says being a Christian is more than just an instantaneous conversion it is a daily process wherever you grow to be more and more like Christ so being a Christian is not some type of instantaneous conversion right he also said this this is a good one I like this when wealth is lost nothing is lost that's because you can get it all back right when health is lost something is lost but look at this when character is lost all is lost I want you to think about that when wealth is lost nothing is lost when health is lost something is lost when characters lost all this loves when your character don't mean nothing to people you know lost everything you said my home is in heaven I'm just traveling through this world he says he says I've read the last page of the Bible it's all gonna turn out all right says God will prepare everything for our perfect happiness in heaven he says God will prepare everything for our perfect happiness in heaven and if it takes my dog being there I believe he'll be there that's what that's it now what do you think he heard that because the Prophet talked about his dog being in heaven he had a vision of his dog being in heaven soon everything I love and everything that ever loved me God has given me a prophet said William Branham and here Billy Graham is quoting that said if my dog would be there I believe he said he said God would prepare everything for our perfect happiness in heaven ever it takes my dog being there I believe he'll be there had a vision he was there on the other side he saw the dog come lick him on the hand the dog was there even saw his horse there I was with you on this vision thing but horses and dogs and stuff in heaven say come on brother you don't went off you say brother I appreciate you know your you know your criticism and everything he said but just tell me where the divorces come from that carry Elijah home you say where the horse come from that Jesus was riding on an axe night I mean in Revelation 19 where did that horse come from if it didn't come from heaven he just put him right back in the work this other one that he said a child who was allowed to be disrespectful to his parents will not have true respect for anyone notice this statement a child who is allowed that's the key allowed to be disrespectful to his parents will not have true respect for anyone so that means pairs got to step up and be parents even if the law I saw y'all all gonna take me away if I knew they was taking me away cuz that's something I said it dated my daughter I'm gonna go to jail with a smile something got happened before I go to jail I'm just let you know I'm gonna I'm gonna go and when I'm sitting there behind bother I will be smiling real good ain't gonna get me there for nothing right imma beat under something but if they allow if a child a child was allowed to be disrespectful to his parents will not have to respect for anyone alright let me just finish this by reading this this little quote I'm gonna do a part two the de sermon because I got some more than I need to share with you proving this word is what I'm reading from and I'm going back I'm reading a quote just to solidify what I was talking about with Abraham and with Sarah and the two that God and two angels coming down to visit them since now he said that will return again son of man which that was that was the son of man right there and when he said that will return again that's that's Jesus said that it's a group 17 as it was in the days of life social of you in the coming of the Son of Man so it says now he said that will return again in the son of man which that was that was a son of man right there when it called him Elohim Lord God Elohim anybody knows that's right elephant is the Lord God in the beginning Elohim created heavens and earth the all-sufficient one the son of man made flesh there he was standing there in flesh at that time like a theophany standing there discerning what Sarah was saying in the behind him they promised watch the Royal seed of Abraham its promised to see the same thing but notice luck he had a messenger down their lot had a messenger down there - two of them went down there one of them went down another one went down with them and they preached and call the people to flee from the wrath that was to come says positionally the world has never sit in that estate from that day that Jesus made the promise them to write now I want to ask any historian that might be in the building or if you here even on this tape and here at any time please write me I've study history now for some 30 years the Bible history and there's never there never has been a person that I've met I've ever seen in all the history of the church through the seven churches that we're now and laid to see it and we know that now let me also just drop this off the reason I'm reading to you what the Prophet said of what brother Ram said we had never heard these things in the churches that we preached that we went to we didn't hear these truths we wouldn't even know these things existed so it's important for me to kind of tell you look a prophet is trying to tell you something here what the Prophet is saying in the Bible time when the Prophet said thus saith the Lord you better be listening and God sent a prophet in this day he had thus saith the Lord we better be listening listen it says now has there been a messenger that ever went to the entire church with his name ending with h8m till now g ra h am billy graham there has been moody's vinny Senki knox luther he just going through church history giving you names and so forth but never a h8m now how many people would have been able to catch that but the Prophet did write never H am father to nations and if you go back and look Billy Graham's ministry went to every nation and the prophets say he was a father to me everybody acknowledged this man's ministry the mint I mean even the president's every I mean a president got an office he went to seek out Billy Graham Clinton got in trouble talking to Billy Graham anytime anything happened I mean Eisenhower all the way up this man was a I mean this man was was was just their Minister and tar the president's they wouldn't have brother branham come in and minister today we call that they seen but see been a nominal or social gospel preacher God used them but in what we call a social gospel preacher he's one that don't rub nobody wrong Oh sometimes you gonna come here and you're gonna get rubbed the wrong way sometimes I come in and get rubbed the wrong way I don't have preachers cut me in my shoes if y'all can see my feet inside my shoes they just like this please don't step no more my toes but you know what that let us know that God loves rebuke and chasten hello somebody when you do wrong you should get rebuked Amen tell us somebody is the truth Amy hi all right let me go on father the nations now remember he is gr aham six letters but Abraham a br aham and seven letters notice they're down there daily Billy Graham going into all parts of the world and calling out a song calling out of Sodom come out flee the wrath that is that is to come there is no man that I know of in the field that has got ahold of God on the word of justification like Billy Graham does he can present it he's not such a theologian I guess he's a theologian but he's he's not just a powerful teacher but God is with him that man will stand there with like a Sunday School lesson hold those people spellbound he is God's servant of the ow that's what a prophet said about him to who the church natural that's in Sodom but remember see his his message went to Sodom now Abraham didn't receive the message inside Abraham was outside aside he had a different messenger all right says but remember there was one church spiritual that wasn't in that denominational outfit either called out group and they received the message also and a messenger and what was it discern of the thoughts that was in the heart God always proves his worth and if you just caught that scroll back up like paragraph 204 right there just take your finger and go up 204 all right now I'll keep going right there notice that way it says name ending in with H am too now gr8 H am Billy Graham there's been moody's fini finish thank Enochs Luther's so forth but never a H am father to nations but remember he is gr aham six letters but a b r8 h am is seven letters notice there down there even preach him h a.m. and knew that his name in h PM and his name has seven letters he knew it but never said nothing about it why it took spiritual revelation for you to understand that he was the messenger to abraham see not church mama no church spirit job and you are Church parrot job always been to groups from the days of Cain and Abel has been to groups two different worship services to different churches two different waves of worship two different way are they offering it to the same God Cain had an offering Ava had an offering both going to the same God one was accepted the other was rejected and the reason a Abel could offer way he offered it's because he had spiritual revelation and let me tell you a flesh and blood did not reveal this unto you but my father and heaven has revealed this unto you and I'm gonna tell you something I'm tell you something else when you cast a revelation worship God and spirit [Applause] you don't worship him in spirit and truth and I'ma tell you this right now God seeking those that want to worship Him like that and he creates an unwanted circumstances to put you in a place where he gonna get that kind of worship from you glory to God my my my church that know what I'm talking about sometimes it's hard to get it all that but I know what I'm talking about it takes spiritual revelation I'm not finished with this I've just had to go away the Holy Ghost say it go today a man but I got mo mo for y'all on this I gotta talk I gotta talk a little bit more about this glory to God let's pray let's pray father we are so grateful for the word a man that you speak to heart God what a what a critical hour that we live in we've been praying we've been lord just gathering together and father just seeking your face on behalf of our loved ones on behalf of our friends Lord and then our desire to see them come to truth because the Bible say well know the truth and it'll make us free so help us God to walk in this truth that has been given to us and when truth will change us truth will transform us truth will will make us look like Jesus we won't compromise with this word and yes there are some things that we do in this world look at look at Silas I'm inside of him and what lot and his daughters and all the things that they were doing down there father it was wickedness in your sight even though they come out and and and and and maybe they're not living the homosexual lifestyle like the others but look for them to come up with the idea that they did in order to bring forth children those girls look at that look in the waiting minds were to even think to do something like that with a and for the father look at where his mind was that he would even do something like that with his daughters God it shows you the wickedness that's in the land today in and it's so easy foster to compromise and feel like well at least we better than this person that's not what you called us to to do is be better than somebody else you're calling us to be Christians we got to be like Christ help us to stop the compromising the hours linked the day is at hand we got to get right we got to get ready we we need to be ready to go we don't know when it's gonna happen but it's gonna happen here you called Billy Graham home he was a he was a sign he was a sign because when those two angels left Sodom destruction was at hand and got destructions on the way the CNS as we heard before if you don't raise up and destroy the US like you destroy Sodom then you would have to raise up Sodom and apologize to them for us for destroying them because of their sin does the same sins are right now in our land and it's not just here in this country it's all over the world god

it's the time of trouble that calms after your coming Lord Lord we have come here to make ready father we see Billy Graham go home at the age of 99 thought that last Angel has left the scene those angels left the scene when Abraham was 99 years old so it's no coincidence that Billy Graham was 99 when the last angel left and after that came the burning God but there also was a body change for Abraham and Sarah the father would make him ready Lord way eating our way into our body changed by feeding on the word of Almighty God and father you brought it to us Lord there was something that you wanted to say to us this morning father we we have ears to hear Lord we're so grateful Lord because Lord you have with them waking up our spiritual understanding Lord God to truly recognize where we're standing at Lord though we must cast everything aside and completely concentrate on you in this hour Lord we want to be like you lost so much lore that we become you a true one is between God and His people father we surrender or we give ourselves to you nor we we need you more and more and I ask o God that you continue to bless your people on me each one here meditate on the words that we've heard this morning or God and may you order in grant spiritual revelation to each one of us that we may recognize what you're doing in this hour and recognize who we are father God and who Jesus
