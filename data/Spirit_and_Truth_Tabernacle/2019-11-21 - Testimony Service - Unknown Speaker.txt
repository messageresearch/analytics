would like to call them incredible things a man that the Lord has done and I trust that we'll all tonight just having opportunities to share from our hearts a man just expressing our appreciation to the Lord for his mighty mighty hand a man on our behalf and I would like to ask so that we don't delay too much time if we'll get started who wants to be first anybody want to be first a man nobody wanted me first I'll be first a man but you don't testify I max everybody I want to share tonight just maybe just make your way up to the front so we can just pass the mic a man we long delay any time and if anybody else want to share how good cause been all right I got a couple of I got a couple of alright praise the Lord all right a man man God is good god is good a man but I think probably I got um I got two testimonies that I bet I want to share but I think one of them I let my wife share and then the other out I'll share a man praise the lord god is good god is good [Music] I'll take a man we got been to goodness first not to say nothing so this year like I said it's been an incredible year for us I think the first testimony I'd like to share something that we were we were not looking for something that we were not expecting but the Lord blessed us with it anyway and I want to say it's back in September that this occurred we were were asked to be a part of a business opportunity here in this area and what has happened is that we've brother and sister who has a business wanted to expand into here in South Florida and they looked at the stearic and I said you know we would love to have you be a part of this business and they access to launch a home health care business here in South Florida so just a Aragon I for our directors of a home health care business here in South Florida so like I said wasn't something that we weren't really looking for but God has opened up this door and we're walking in with a man with everything we got so y'all keep us in prayer we want to make sure that it doesn't you know affect ministry in any way but but we felt it was an opportunity that we couldn't say no to and and we decided to you have to prayer we decided to embrace it and so God God blessed us with a business state man this year and that's that's incredible it named for me that's incredible as he said it was something that we weren't looking for and it was just amazing the way it came about apparently they have been watching us for a while and how we can't do certain things and and they just felt as though we would we would just be a perfect fit you know to run the business for them and the thing is is you know what they said to us was basically you know you have to kind of think towards the future you know he as the obviously as the Lord's will but you know he may get to some point you know that he you know that he needs to step away from the ministry and retire and and in doing that you know you have to have a plan I mean you know so so you know it's just the the business is basically came about as a way for us to have a plan you know people who have jobs you know in the secular working world they have 401ks they have IRAs they have all of these things but unfortunately and I wouldn't say unfortunately because we as he said that you know those are resources God is our source but as you step away from the ministry you know if the church is not in a position to continue you know for lack of a better term funding you know the funding the the the minister then you know you have to have other ways that you won't put a burden on the church and so and and so they when they mention that it's like you know what that's true I mean I have been thinking of different things you know you know maybe trying to fund a IRA for myself or a Roth or something like that at some point in time you know but but those are things that you know people don't really think about until you're there until you're you know say 75 to 80 years old and you can never and you can't go go on and you know handle the church and you need to step down and allow someone else to step in you know at that point what happens so I thought that you know we need when they brought this I thought it that it was really a tremendous opportunity for us to you know for us to be able to kind of look to the future God knows I'm not looking to stay here none of us are but you know brother branham also told us that we just happened that weird to continue to you planting potatoes continue to plant them you know so um so those are you know ways and honestly we're always looking for a way that you know that that we won't be a burden you know to to the church so um so I just thank God for this opportunity and and ask for your prayers solicit your prayers that that got to lead us and guide us because we're learning new things and this is something you know we we never really thought about but we're you know we're willing to embrace it as a blessing from God another thing I forgot to mention Lord bless us with ten employees already [Music] just keep missing frame we want but employees to work so I keep some prayer but the other testimony I want to just share I told you all about and somebody else saw the truck that the more blessed me with the testimony behind that is that I was not even looking for a truck I got called by a friend of mine and said hey there is a truck on a particular lot and I meet you to go test drive the truck for me said I just need to do a test drive it and and test drive it after you test drive it just call me back and let me know but you know what you know what it's like because I'm gonna fly or actually I'm gonna come to town I'm gonna buy that truck and I'm gonna leave town I said okay so I went to the car lot and I went to look at the truck and I test drove the truck and I did all these things and while I'm there to Carlisle I look at the corner of my eye I see this other truck I say well told us doesn't see actually just bring me the keys that out but let me see what happen to do and I just you know I couldn't even test drive because it was it was raining and everything that day but he the salesman happen to pull it underneath a under covering and when he got there it just so happen to be a man standing there that owned the truck like that just moved a different model and so I didn't know nothing by the truck I'm trying to look around act like I know what I'm looking at and the guy the guy could see that I didn't know what I was doing so he came over he just start ripping things apart to see this disc this dude he said give me Commission on this he he just showed me an old truck I said well all right that's nice so I say well we'll see I just prayed about it and I told my wife about us and we'll see if it's something that best for me now and I decided I went down to the lot talk to them about it and I had a certain number of my mind that I wanted to pay for it and so when we talked that first day we were I want to say probably four thousand dollars away from the number that I wanted to be in and I say no no I did my day today for anything I want that and now that you're not just left and you know I'm just left it like that so the salesman told my friend say yeah your friend come back and look at that truck we just couldn't get the numbers work down I say yeah oh well I'm not gonna worry about it so uh my friend say I'm coming on such and such a day I'm coming to buy the other truck and I'm gonna see if I can get both trucks worked into the same deal I say okay he say how much you want to pay for us I told how much I wanted to pay and he said Oh cameras if I can get both just worth that I say okay so he was going back and forth and he he said I can only get him to drop another $500 from weird where you work I say I can't I can't do that at Best Buy I don't worry about it take your blessing and you know praise the Lord he takes me about an hour ladies say yeah I got him to move I got him down four hundred dollars above where you want to be will you take the truck I say yes I will four hundred dollars more than where I got to be I will our glad to take the truck and so the Lord blessed through him getting a truck the deal work that where I got the truck and at the price that I wanted it and and and I think it was six thousand dollars less than what they had on the sticker price so I think [Applause] okay while they were working the transaction what my friend did he got them down to a certain number and then my friend said I'm gonna put some money down as well in order to get you down to this number so I'd say I never seen nobody do nothing like that and he asked me do you want to say yeah I want it I want it if I if I said no I think I'd be happy throwing a blessing back in God's face so I said yes I'll take it and so I'm grateful grateful for that and that that was not a plan of just what God did so something incredible a man crazy boy [Music] [Laughter] why would she be free if I had a toothache strategy so what I've heard a little bit but it has been an incredible year all based off of inspiration of the pasady is that service when he preached and the whole church does grab hold of it so it's been one thing after the next between Kay's doors open vessels of Mercy vessels of Wrath I mean I'm just grateful for God confirmed and answer some prayers that I've had in my heart and let me know a lot of planning but most importantly thankful for bless me with my father because I wasn't expecting it it was I knew I needed it because after I got back sent the rental car that I had pretty much was getting ready to go and I needed a car I just happened to look in that cloud just came on a lot to be out look better so just the way everything worked out and you know I called her brother and went the price and everything I was kind of like I wasn't gonna pay that so I called her brother for dear friend of mine and he was like listen if God's gonna bless you with it God's gonna take care of you to make sure you can afford it so I was like you got a point so I got it I'm thankful for it it was something I needed and something of mixed or both because I'm so I appreciate that but also he just opened up a door for me to refinance it to where now I got it down about $200 less than what I was originally grants alright I'm grateful for that and just also after having back surgery and He healed me I mean I don't have no pain and everywhere perfect amazing yeah I mean there's so much things I can thankful for just the roof over my head he's done so much for me this year has truly been an incredible year because you know I've seen God move in my life and so many others lives just through prayer that we've done Tuesday nights I mean a lot of the prayers of an answer I mean I'm just grateful [Applause] Gregg has been really really good to me and I thank him so much for his grace in his mercy and his love his companionship there's been a lot of things that's that I can say about my blessing but I'm gonna keep it short and just give you one that was given to me today one of my drivers called me today and he told me that she had been in an accident and asked me and I heard about it and I said no nobody told me about it so she said she was on her way to close thing but she goes about three or four times a week and something flew into her car and broke the side window in her windshield and she said she has no idea where it came from she has no idea what it was and she she said she she was hurt but just flew minor scrapes scrapes and things from glass shards so I think for just protecting her I really do she said she didn't call anybody she went on to Clewiston did her job came back finished her job and then she called her husband and told her of him about it said she didn't want to call anybody because she didn't want anybody to get all upset so to me I just you know we pray we pray for God's hand of protection around us and I pray for the drivers God's hand protection around them and when we when I pray sometimes you pray about just accident somebody not hitting you know running to them or them running into somebody but something like this I had never thought about so I just thank God for His grace and His mercy and His divine protection and his hands of protection around this drug and I thank you for her dedication god bless you give honor and glory to the Lord Jesus I don't remember the right stuff okay so first of all I want to be I just want to thank the Lord for the honor to lay my dad to rest at Arlington Cemetery it was a year in the making calling back it was a challenge actually to be honest with you to give it all ordinated I ended up having to right a congressional where you write your Congressman and get them involved because the once you submit the application is win in August so as we like about three months and it was like a year before they gave me the final the final life but that was after I had actually went through and contacted my car wrote and wrote out a letter and stuff like that so it was and then when he when they actually gave me a date it was a coordinated with convention there and in Maryland right like it's like the day after so everything kind of worked out perfectly after that and then Oh brother Jack and sister Erica was able to come so I appreciate the support that professors always given me since I've been here in South Florida and I can tell you it'd be hard for me to leave you say you have to get a crowbar to attempt to leave or musically to South Florida no way no way I love love South Florida I love my church thank you for a great church thanks for the Saints it's an honor and a privilege to be among you and to be fellowshipping with you and Tuesday prayers and combined prayers what a wonderful honor it is to be in the midst of life precious thing so I'm very thankful for that I I kind of did a little trick on the pastor because last September was actually the September the 25th September 25th I got a new car the Lord blessed with a car so I got it on the 25th and I have been talking to the Lord because actually they they wanted they had given me they had me have a car like a week prior to that one and and I was gonna get things going to deliver that one to me then I went out when I looked at I won't end up looking at it I ended up not getting that in it actually ended up being delayed and in my mind I had this and this this appointment that I wanted to play out for our pastor there and so God had to coordinate everything together for that happen and so what happened I got the board that got the car on the twenty yeah but not only that I got to get a car in the 25th I closed on a new house on the 26 but I wanted to have brother Jack come over and see the house but I wanted to have a car in the garage oh he got there so he walked up so what I did was I had the car I moved the car over to from out of the place I moved it I drove it over to the new house park in the garage then I walked back home I said brother Jack she couldn't come fix me up I want to show you something so he's talking I can come over to meet you so he came over pick me up I said he came over to the house I said like he was planning on coming in because that's who he thought was gonna come in I said no we got to take a little ride so we drove around the corner and I was like stop here go here here stop here I said this is my new house it's like oh brother so we walked through a new stuff like that so you know I everybody's walking around looking good stuff so he found me he walks around it goes through the laundry and then it goes out to the garage you know opens the door he sees the car in there and just like hey they left the car you know I say no yes yes yeah you got a toaster so that was wonder I was like I had to play all that out Moorhead to coordinate the timing and everything so everything would you know what kind of meat and fit perfect and he made it so I thank the Lord for that God is concerned about every thing that we love my brother Branham says all that we love will be there right so even their little things and things you don't you may have something in your back you you had or something like that but those little things he like just let you have it as a blessing and so I've always hated my mind I play golf right always kind of here yeah be nice to hit the ball from the tee and get it in that hole shot so the Lord blessed me about a week and a half ago I couldn't even see the hole I just hit the ball went over and I thought I was like oh this thing must have went past then went past the hole I was like so the guy that I was like four of us together so we rolled over and we were like Patton the hole was this way he was walking around was like I can't see this father know what happened to that ball that's so weird and there was another guy on the green right and he'd went and put knock this ball in a hole and so he goes over here he looks down he's like hey hey there's another ball in here I was like yeah so what's the name of that ball he said he told me search alright I'll say he blessed me with that and so the last thing I wanted to say I'm just going to be thankful I'm thankful for in abeyance right in advance I'm declaring and I'm thankful for the restoration of my son [Applause] if you play golf you understand why he gave that testimony but that's incredible we said all right my brother prays will accomplish first of all I want to thank the Lord for blessing both of sin such tremendous editing skills what you did at our last service bill I want three god bless I appreciated praise the Lord oh yes a little bit after we met brother Stephen found out he was working at sentence I started a plane I guess roughly three years ago applying for that job yeah everything has been going pretty well with it yesterday I spoke with the lady in HR she told me all I had to do was have a drug test and to be about a week before I get it back get me get the results back and uh she called me today and she said I'm mr. Johnson the job is yours so you told me that call on my dad give her my start date which will be November 25th alright but the most incredible thing that I like to testify about is you know the things that we've heard preached this year especially where we are now when we just finished war strategies just looking back over the past couple of months with the things that we have been talked I've been challenged on almost every day at work and the response that I would have given you know South Carolina Esther and the finest if you want to jump on here my boss would've did what he did without this preaching it would've got pretty but I was able to pray for him throughout everything that was going through right now I can see him shake his hand smile talk with him he may be doing different things behind my back that I know of just keep pressing the bass I know that the Lord is working everything out for us now I don't know how everything is gonna turn out over the next couple of weeks you know once I once I heard about the job immediately my wife got hold of a realtor so house is gonna be on the market trying to give it another house I thought God's gonna have to do incredible they might be the way that Satan has been fighting this year we have been touched tremendously and I'll find that since I see tremendous so God is gonna have to do whatever and I believe for the incredible I've been watching everything that has been doing knowing that everything is working for our good and watching it has been declared to us this is the year of the aircraft and we are witnesses of what's been going on that's incredible and I look at this thing that we're going through God is allowing us to come to a place where we know whatever he's getting ready to do we couldn't do it it's gonna have to be the hand of God to get us here in South Florida is God and that's going to be fast another thing that we're grateful for August 3rd last year I injured my shoulder yeah pretty ironic that August 3rd of this year who does she know wedding her friends so in the year's time God did something very special for me and my wife that it was one of our goals we were looking for a way down the road it happened so fast and God is doing tremendous things and we're just excited about it Australia another incredible thing is you know normally when you're going through the trouble that you're going through a wife gets so frustrated we need to do this we need to do that she hasn't been that way she's been on my side she's been sending me quotes on scriptures every morning had and that work and that's something incredible because if we before this teaching on without that girl wouldn't the talk about putting meal I think the Lord for each of you because sometimes you just don't know when I've had pretty rough weeks some of the things that y'all was say right outside this church will be exactly exactly and all the brothers chattering little poops little scriptures the thing that I need right at that morning what come across and I want to thank the Lord that he's able to use you to do something incredible for me god bless each one know what I just want to thank you that's alright praise the Lord brother got the job here in West Palm Beach so every relocate name on you hey man glory to God I got three things I want to thank God for it first thing I wanted to thank him for this is the second year year number two I was still cancer-free [Applause] I don't know why they make me go back every year to get tested again up on the weapon it's gone I know that it's gonna still be cancer for us so I think God for that also I thank God for my job that it must be MIT so I no longer have to go to Broward that he'd let me witness it's the same work that I was doing in private but it's here in Palm Beach County and I just thank God for such a sometimes I wake up in this light wow this is really my job it's such a relaxed low stress I mean I can get the word and I just sit on my computer and I wait for a phone call if I get one I don't I just sit on my computer I just think gotta have a wonderful supervisor but it's very I mean just you can ask for a better classroom job I really can I just thank God for that because I know the jobs like this don't come back too often and I thank him first protection so whenever I do work I take care of all of patients that may come up with tuberculosis in Palm Beach County so I think God first protection whenever I do have to go to a hospital I have to actually sit in the room with the person that's active tuberculosis and I just thank God for his protection and keeping me while I'm surrounded by these demons also the third thing I want to thank our for is blessing us with a place to live we would had to move back in April and we were having problems with them previous place we're at we were looking for a place to live we really had to move in a hurry because what the conditions was just unlivable and we were looking and look at him driving around and looking and met with a million didn't see a lot of different places of ikana in a crunch to accept a place so we went to see this place and we almost signed the lease no we were they were going over the lease with us and then my husband was looking at each other like huh but we really want to sign this it was just some crazy stuff on the lease I mean some crazy stuff but we were so desperate almost signed the lease they got to like page 7 we were like yeah no like wow are you serious no can't do it so we got this close to sign that lease and was like no you can't do it nevermind that's okay well I want to place that bad so isn't a good thing you did because it was first of all it was upstairs it was very very tiny it was nice but a very very tiny and like I said it was more money and a whole lot of crazy stuff on the lease that we would have been responsible for it so because we didn't do that the very next day the realtor sent us the lists and saying look at this list to see if you see anything else the same list and this place is honor we just went further down on the list we saw this place was like hey that's nice let's go look at that one tomorrow so we went to see the place they set it up we went to see the place somebody was still living in it at the time and they met with us so we can walk through a walkthrough we really fell in love with the place and nobody else had saw it nobody had put in for it so we were like yes we want the place let's get it let's get it and thank god it worked out we were able to get the place even before the current people moved out we were able to sign a lease on the place by getting the place is much bigger cheaper nicer everything just you know God is working out he is a provider a man all right I just wanted she just that when we first thought in looking forward that was the first place I bought it riding around and just looking for places the place where we're at is the first place I went to look at and I'm riding around through the place in my pre I said Lord this is where I wanna be and I went home and I told my wife I said I wanted to be I described the area to us that's what we wanna be that's where I want to be but it was nothing for it nothing for renting that place so we thought she said he was in the crutches and I heard we had to get out of my hair so I thought I call the realtor loose on a second up walk through the bank I'll to go while she's at work and tell us that you know they're doing elect it's getting electric so we were like she said very desperate Emily almost signed quit and I told her if I say this is not a trap like she said we thought we had to walk away even the realtor was like she knew what kind of a situation that was vanished she was like okay so we'll and like she said her people had not even moved out of this place yet see this place and before they even moved out they gave us the opportunity and we signed the lease and that was a clear place to by the way that was back first and I go back do it some of you all weren't here when I first announced this if you want to share a testimony wait right on this side over here over here to my right because I got a certain way I want to do things and I so you want to share just make sure you make yourself over to the right just where they just went all right good otherwise if you're those over there that mean you don't want to share testimony all right come on yes y'all come on y'all come off praise the Lord but first of all I want to thank God for when I gave my life to the Lord the process was kind of slow but why I'm extending him being able to share this testimony with you guys is because God allowed me to hold to a lot of things and build a really solid foundation for me and I've been able to extend something strong some big things the devil has thrown at me in guys a lot of those thing right and I can I have built this I probably got more wrong things and good things but I have built this trust in the Lord and this confidence in God that I can pray through things and I can give things to God and I can actually know that he works in mysterious ways but he performs incredible where you may know I got this beautiful lady sitting right here and I she probably has made me decide do we have testimonies together we have testimonies separately but there's one big thing that I have to bring to you guys and share because last year I said that something was gonna happen okay we homeowners then I'll explain a little bit because it's not really about being a homeowner that's alright because I was on Sunday and I was just my Sunday and see how I am you see how it's nothing it's not a lot for us to have has not affected my budget it has not affected my prayer all right it's actually even tell her we were like I'm gonna tell you how it happened but I just want to say that we were like like really excited when we do have any kind of the Devils you know like you over here like acting like like like you're not supposed to be all that exhales thing you know we supposed to be excited that's right no it doesn't mean that what God is giving us is making who we are but ya know so I was like I was excited we were wanted to buy a house three years ago we were ready to buy a house three years ago we couldn't find the house that we wanted we found a house that we liked you put a contract on it things happening but would kidding we had to back out of it you saw a couple of the houses to contrast and it just wasn't happening and then last year around the same time we put a contract in this house and that was it this house is about God showing himself through the things that's what just blows me away you know didn't happen in at all and I said what about this fire we're signing a lease again this is gonna be the last lease Teresa okay so we inside beside a lot of haters but it wasn't Italy you know so we I just want to say like a couple of little key things because I could stay here and just talk all night about what God is doing and how he's been doing this but yeah it's been he's been so specific I asked her I said lord if this is the time I want to not have to not work take me through the process without worries because last couple of times so hard you it didn't even feel right you was worried this and then some it was happening foolish stressing and I was just like something is that I don't think it's not the time but God was allowing us to go through it because we felt any were trusting God you know we're like this is saying God you took this way this is it but it wasn't the time you know we find another house for this house but we pull contracting for the people they did not return the inner counters I can answer anything No so then all of a sudden you think looking at the houses and they didn't answer us and then you go in the house like $40,000 so oh that's right what it's like all right that's it now they gotta give it to us cheaper and I was like let's just let's just cut it you know where he steals whole process we gonna pray body and I say you know what we're not big ass here we're not gonna we're not gonna we're not gonna do anything but you kind of like broke that of course made us kind of like like wait a little more she's like he makes does something seem like she really does and I'm not hosting this one in the pictures were horrible and we found out I came into the house for me to give you exactly how it was I would have to tell you so many things but we found out we gotta for the price I was standing on that one time there somebody else I think it was Rachel Stephen and they would think they wanted they would try to get a house and the house was morning and I keep saying you know what you don't have to you don't have to find a cheaper house God is gonna give the house that you won for the price that you want without happening on the oh the house that we were gonna close on if I can just add this was a smaller house they didn't have a pool then y'all wanted exactly what I wanted in this house that we get the we get it now has the rooms that we wanted bigger not that I wanted every pretty much you beat everything else that we got more than we asked all right well uh actually gave us more than we wanted man and the last house that we were gonna get at that time we were gonna get a percentage our percentage interest rate was going to be four point two we have their contract I told Amanda that you were then we're ready to bring the contract we had to pay for two months to break the contract that's what we signed for it so we closed in the house on November December January contract so the money that we were gonna have to pay the two months and that was all worried about us moving with her school and all that stuff so now the money that we had to pay we now we have the house and we have the other house and we're not breaking the curtain we fish in the contract and brother Quentin said that he got a new car brother Jack's day he got a new car this I closed of the house [Applause] besides all those things the guys gave it doesn't change my approach to God rather doesn't change something that just makes it so much bigger so I couldn't just stay here I would not have now it just wouldn't that's not a testimony testimony is that we got help but the real testimony is how that did it how he brought us through how we had to look back the things that we went through forgot to be able to put us in a play then when you get to this place where God already like feels that like you really like brother Jack you know can you break that down for that but like you get to a place where I just seen just delete some things that you can you can I can't explain I can not but that's why I can't I can't explain but he's just like himself and that is them look that's the one thing I always ask you this just prove yourself to me brother Quinn and I wish I'd have made a list I have so many things to be thankful for so I've been here for you know just a few years but before that my life was very different before I met the Lord it was very very different and so was after I had gotten out of the military I was kind of wondering you know I didn't really have a place a direction a purpose you know and that all changed when I met the Lord and the Lord grabbed me and shook me you know and just changed everything so from that moment up until now just trying to find God's will for my life you know before that I was just drifting you know I really didn't know what I wanted to do with my life I didn't know I any purpose you know living that was the purpose but as far as like a career or something like that I mean so so going through school I feel perfectly placed at PBA right now just I mean so many things have happened there with the cancer fatigue program that I've worked with a meeting brother quite cool things that have happened with advisors and so forth and so but as far as moving forward I have just been praying and asking God to keep me in his will because I don't want to pursue something that's you know I'm just doing it for money or you know nothing right intentions without even knowing it you know and that's really easy to do once you get like in the academics so now I'm very thankful because going through that I took an internship over the summer and during that internship a couple of a few days after I started there they offered me a job well I took the job and I told them okay I'm gonna take this job because but I wasn't looking for a job so we're gonna take it and if I can't make it work you know I'm gonna give it a couple weeks and if it's too much I'm gonna you know so it was it was too much with my schoolwork but it was a it was a good opportunity because as I was working there I just I was able to see what my career would would be in that and even though it was great even though I can do it even though I knew you get it and I would make a lot of money I I didn't feel like passionate about it you know it wasn't something that I felt like it was calling for me to do that it was kind of just something I would do that would get us to where we want it to be and so a whole bunch of stuff has happened and to tell you that would take forever but a whole bunch of stuff has happened since then because after that experience that I started praying and asking God you know kind of help me through this because I'm having doubts and which everybody does so you know help me find where you want me to be and so things are working in a direction now where I'm thankful that he is showing me where he wants me to be I'm very excited and motivated and very uplifted about the things that are going on so I'm thankful for that because I feel like I'm finding my place with my where my education sleeting me for my career so I'm very thankful for that more to come but hold it um with the house and the truck that was a really big thing for us he kind of said everything but oh okay so I just I was in the military so I go to school and my school is funded through a government program so um I got a letter in the mail oh it was scary so you're gonna let her in the mail and they said okay the money back up when I first got out of the military I started receiving benefits for a disability and that disability was a major depressive disorder I was on a depressant and I was depressed when I first guy was military so they sent me a letter in the mail and they said which I'm no longer depressed but they sent me a letter in the mail and they said hey it looks like you're doing better we noticed you haven't had any prescriptions checked out we noticed you haven't been going to therapy we're gonna take away your benefits now that included a whole bunch of stuff including my education so the program that I am in is only for disabled veterans so I was you know at first I was like ok God you know do you not want me there school do you want me to be out of the government's pocket like what how is this gonna work out you know so I was just praying for God to give me patience and help me not to worry which thank God I wasn't worrying they want the the thing with the military and the the disability you have to make them believe that you are disabled for them to give you anything so I would have had to go into an office with someone and convince them that I was suffering from a major depressive disorder for me to be able to keep my benefits and at first that was battling in my mind and the more that God just worked on my heart it took like a week but I'm sorry the more the color my heart with that the more that God worked on my heart with that I was it was torturing neck I just hurt like I couldn't go sit in front of these people and tell them that I was majorly depressed like what am I gonna do cry I don't know what about what so I talked to him about it and I was telling him you know I I think I think we're gonna lose like everything all my benefit this school the money everything so we just kept praying about every way together Jackie gave us great guidance as always and thank God for a pastor so so we just kept praying and you know I came to the conclusion that if that was God's will to take that away then if it was his will for me to keep going to school he'd make away you know so it really wasn't stressing me out or bothered me or anything okay so anyway so anyway I called my vocational rehabilitation counselor and she's the one who gives me my money and so I called her and I said hey I just got a letter that says I'm not gonna be any longer so you know am i qualified she was like well you know we're really not in the business of kicking people out of the program once they started because that was so big you know I love I love being able to go to school and so that was huge so I just thank God for that for making a way for helping me to have peace through that because they are going to pay for my Master's are gonna pay for a few certifications that I meet that are like thousands of dollars so they are Jesus so I'm very thankful for that there's more okay I'm sorry overall I'm just very thankful for God just working with us in our marriage you're married you know it's not pretty all the time so just thankful because um we're both a little feisty and so God is working with us with our patience and just working with communication skills and so many so many so many things and so I'm just very thankful so my kids rock okay just just quickly to add to a portion of testimony and God's done some incredible things for them in the process didn't buy the house the sellers ancient somehow new brother Josue was a Christian and the sellers agent he got connected with little Josue and and asked him to come and do ministry opportunities right and they were where was the place that you all going what's the name of it what what do they do there what okay so the you know the sales agent cells they should work for the people but here's the buyer they say I want you to come and do some ministry with me brother Josue shows up to do you know they say it was even a miracle for him to get to the place that he was supposed to been working that day and somehow his boss say hey we stop and work today and if we stop him right now you like well since we stopped and that I got time to make it to this appointment so he went to the sellers agent appointment and when he got there the agent said oh this is brother little sweat he gonna bring the word today do you like what so you just open up the script during this year right and I say I say I say the thing of it is is unfortunately the people in the world will call all y'all preachers everybody in here but we've reached out there in the world right I'm sisters y'all be preachers out there in the world y'all just share one scripture some of the cars that I got from you know some of y'all real script I say they have you preaching before you know it right but uh but the thing is sometimes you get yourself in situation just share brother branham say telling high it got lit all right you just be the light and time I got lit but I thought that was incredible that he would give an opportunity to sell us agent would call him to come in and just share a little bit so we thank God for that sister Charisse Amen you coming at this time please alone [Applause] okay so I have two testimonies so the first testimony I like to give is thinking god I got a new job and it really wasn't anything I was looking for at the time I just one day went online and apply for the job then I want to see the very next day I got a phone call from the companies I guess president Regent manager anyway she called me and I was actually at work and I'll be right back so so I talked with the with the manager and she was saying I was looking over you know your resume and and she was saying I'm gonna she liked my resume and we had a conversation and she's like I'm gonna pass on your resume along to the office that I'm working at now the office manager and you know expect a call so I think maybe two days later went by I got a call again I was at work but now she she said could I do a phone interview and I said sure so we did the phone interview I think it was about 15 minutes and she was like well I like the things that you know you're talking about I feel like you would be great for the office would you be able to come in for a working interview so I went for the working interview and I thought it went great and they were you know I met all the doctors and all that and they said okay so maybe give us a couple of days and we'll get back to you you know whether or not we got the job we have some other candidates so the very next day as that work again and I got the call that they wanted me to fill the position so I'm happy for that a job working out was in Jupiter and so in December it would've been a year that I was there and there's nothing wrong with the job but I just didn't like the fact that I had to drive the Jupiter every single day so the job that I'm at now is almost like right down the street from my house like nine minutes away better benefits higher pay so I'm thinking God for that I like to thank God for is his protection one see a month ago while we were up at the meetings in North Carolina Friday night we had left to church and I was in the car with three other girls we left a church to go get something to eat and I was driving one of the girls car and we had I had just merged on the highway and I'm driving and I had just gotten to the merge into another Lane and right up beside us is one of those big semi-truck stood two semi trucks and so I'm not you know thinking anything of it then all of a sudden while I'm driving the car just started just spinning just spinning and swerving and I couldn't and I'm holding it with both hands and all I could see was still this semi truck on the side of us and I was just like - because I knew if we would hit that semi-truck we really all would you know then so I was just it's all happening in in seconds and I'm processing in my mind I'm just like I just can't we just cannot hit this truck can I hit this truck and as I was you know trying to drip the car to just stopped from spinning I just had to I want to say it was God that helped me give me this shrimp to this jerk the car and we were on the left the left side of the lane we're next to it was a wall we just had to crash into that and I'm just thinking God so much because I really don't know how we all made it out of that that accident alive we had bumps bruises but in the car was total but I've just thinking God so much for a second chance and just allowing us to make it out one thing I would say is and I feel like what was God because there's many times that I've kind of rode on that Highway like that I was always busy and at that time where we were on the highway it was just us in that semi truck and and just hard when we talked about it all one of the girls in the back she said when she saw us spinning all she saw was like her door basically in the truck so I think God so much there was I want to say it was God that sent this lady she was almost a little ways back but she said she saw everything and she got up the car and and she had helped us all out you know we say overgrown girl we were all acting like babies on the side of the road just crying coming crying because I mean I was just in disbelief that we all just made it out alive so I just want to thank God for protection I mean it was a wake-up call to me not to take the grace of God for granted and just a whole thing of you gonna make it to your next destination cuz you really don't know so I just think God for that [Applause] precious sister other sisters that were involved in that thank God for keeping them sister Michelle you can't embrace that mercy and thank God for the protection I I have a lot to say to God to be grateful for that's one of the things to really give him great thanks for it's just his protection and just allowing my daughters to understand and know to believe God and understand God for themselves not for me but for themselves so and I thank God for that I also like to just think God for this year this year has just been such a awesome year and I say awesome meaning with all the tests and trials that have come my way I still call it awesome because I've seen God hand just work so tremendously in my life and I've seen him just grow me and mature me so closely and so much more to him but I thank him for that with that being said I'd like to also just give thanks to brother Troy for the quick was not host night here for your ministry here this year it just has been so awesome such a blessing it has just been so timely and when I'm praying and fasting and just speaking with my daughter or speaking to someone else and I can come into the house of God and just hear not only my pastor talk and confirm some of the same things that I'm talking about but the associate ministers come in and speak the same thing it's a blessing so I think God for I associate minister it's years but I thank God for that I also like to thank God for I also got a new part but how that happened was I like to thank God for our business and it just has been such a blessing and they thought for the testing trials but it's been such a blessing and my car was perfectly fine but it had come up to a hundred and ninety eight thousand miles and I had not had it in two years and so I was going in to get an extended warranty that's all I was going in to get was an extended warranties my car was perfectly fine had it checked out they were like wow four hundred and ninety eight thousand miles this car is great I was like perfect and so when I went in to look for the extended warranty the guy said well for three years 36,000 miles it's gonna cost this much for years 48,000 miles don't cost this much five years but was it gonna work thing and I said my lord that's not gonna work because I could do that in two months and so of course salesmen come around the corner and he says oh you come into my pocket no I'm not I'm coming to get a warranty he didn't know you coming about a car I said were the only way I'm gonna buy a car and you know my motto he said I know I know but you know you got to give me some money and you know no payments got to go up I said you know my motto he said Miss King let me work on it as I said when you work on that and so I said there for a little while and I thought about it and I said you know I'm not buying a car but I do need to get this warranty I had I was at a hundred and ninety eight thousand miles before my warranty expired and in order for me to get a new warranty that warranty could not expire so I knew that next day I had to go back to Miami and that was gonna kind of really eat up my mouth so so he came back and he said I could do this this and this but you're gonna have to do this this and this so I said I'm gonna do this this and this and I'm not gonna do that so he sent it well no I can't do that I said give my keys back I'm not gonna do that and so he said okay let me do this he said what color car you wanted so I called Cherie son no she called me and so she heard it she in the background just yelling out a color car I couldn't even think cuz I'm I'm just in there to get a warranty I really was not gonna buy her car she's yelling out a color car he hear on the background see so he tells somebody else go get that car so the guy going get the car and he came back to the car when he came back with a basic car and I had a luxury car and so he drove the basic car but I said that's a Turner Keith's car I'm giving you a push start car and a sunroof and you know leather but you've given me a turnkey thought I said no this is not gonna work right Cheney said but for the money that you want to pay this not gonna work so he said ok so Nikko he said well what other color car do you want if you want that so he'd go he said ok again now my 20:18 was driven off the truck with 7 miles he go and find a 20-19 off the truck what five miles drives it up he said miss King I got a push start sunroof leather I got it oh it's fully loaded it is a sports I don't want that he said yes you do ok ok work work your numbers so he didnae he's trying to work his numbers do you know how they play the games but he know I didn't play the game so he come back with his number and I came back with my number so he said therefore in a while and I told my said listen in order for me to do this part I'm not gonna go any higher than what I am paying right now for my car you gotta pay my car off and I gotta come out at a certain amount to come out with this all right he said I can't do that yes you can if you want me to get this car I can't I got it I'm gonna lose my job if you lose your job this is what you do every day you've been doing this for years you know what you're doing so he went in the office and he come back out and this King this is what they offered me I said mr. Carlos you tell your finance guy to come sit right here he's not gonna tell my if you want me to buy this car come out the office what do you want to pay this is what I want to think he said well who gonna pay the rest of this your paw you are okay so we sat down we wrote it out he said you're gonna sign this I say you gonna sign it first he said okay so he signed it first I signed it after so meaning he was gonna agree that what he was gonna pay this is what I was gonna pay so after we agreed that what he was gonna pay what I was gonna pay and I knew everything was gonna work out so as the night go on then you got to go to the bag to get the financing and everything like that so we get to the back to get to the financing and I said listen before you get to going to remind my credit I have a lock on my credit and you don't have to call me so is you're gonna have to have them call me so they kept trying kept trying kept trying to catch on so you saying miss King I can't get them to coughing I said you didn't listen to me I told you I have a lock on my credit so they're gonna have to call me he say well just take the car home and and didn't just come in here tomorrow I said okay so he called me the next day he say well I'm gonna need some money down he's going to next day said no you know I told you I'm not giving you no money now so just have my car sitting out front with my keys because you could have this car back I don't get attached to anything he said what don't you like the car I see you know some nice stuff but I don't get attached to it so when I went back in the next day he came back and he said the numbers not adding up notice the actual finance guy I said well your owner says this is what I could have this is what I want so you have to work the numbers I ended up getting my car pay for my new heart less money than what I needed and my insurance drop for everything that I need I really thank God because and it wasn't some people saying it was persistence it's not persistent it's just that I trusted God and I know and I sat there and I said god this is what I have where I have to be this is what I need this is what I have to do and if you sometime if you get too ahead of God you know you get yourself in financial trouble and I said I I would never do that and I know if God brought me here he will he will make the way for me so I think God for just being persistent and just saying that you know this can happen and this will happen and it did happen and I saw God just financially just work numbers out and he was just like I don't know how you always come in here do that how you always come in here and make us eat almost $12,000 why do you do that how do you do that you need a job here so the regional manager came out do you want a job No thank God I see it's the God he took me to the side and he said you know i sat here and I watched you and I watched your character and he said there's something different about you and I I really true to thank God for you just being in here you didn't get bothered you didn't get upset you didn't waver this man ended up giving me almost $200 in gift cards I say well God thank you think my favorite it's the favor of God and I just thank God and I think offer so much and I think I for just standing fast on his word and just holding fast to his word and just believing in him and trusting on him certainly appreciate got this working everything down our famous sister Rachel I see you sister Erica you coming back okay second round we came to bless you but just to go back I was telling me ma about what happened as far as getting the house and everything mutt specters oh and she said you need to tell that testimony in church eyes oh well we did and she said I don't think it came across like that next time we have a testimony sir tell them in church so I said okay so Stephen said go tell testimony about the house and so I was like okay I'm telling oh because a lot of it really was surrounded around God making away from me and that ended up making away for us but back in December we actually put money down on a house we were gonna get it and it just kind of seemed like the people were dragging their feet and it felt like it was on purpose because they made a sign a paper that said basically if everything doesn't go through by this time we couldn't get a refund are we gonna get our money back for it but then the ball was in their court and they weren't moving and they were saying oh it's the holidays we can't and we're like well then give us our money back or give an extension on this they wouldn't do it so we said forget it we're just poor money and we really thought that was the place like we really thought that was the place and it wasn't and we were just kind of trying to figure out well if that isn't it then what is it and we started talking and saying god we want a new bill like we want to be able to walk in and pick out everything that we want in the house and have them put it together and we'll move in and so God made a way for us to stumble upon what we have now and it hadn't been built yet and we picked a lot of pic number two we did no purpose and so they told us that was in January they told us all right you're gonna move in in July so we said well you know good so the way that they had it set up a lot of newer homes when they're being built they say give you like incentives and one of the incentives that they had was to forget to be home we'll pay all your closing costs up to a certain number and so we got we've got with the the well up until that point we were basically being told that Stephen was the only one that could be on the loan because even though our bank my deposits into the bank was showing I was making money the my taxes because of the way I wrote my taxes it wasn't showing that like I was below poverty level so I couldn't be on the loan at all so we would have to do everything through Stephen and because of that they were telling us we were going to need like eleven thousand dollars in addition to closing costs and everything else like that and we were just like a man in addition to our down payment and all the other stuff that we were just like you know we don't want to have to pay that so coming up on that time you know we just said you know we're gonna we're gonna pick the house we're gonna do everything right we're gonna believe God to make a way that's it because we were holding on to what brother Jack had said go out and get what you want and God will take care of it so we said we're just gonna hold on to that we repeated that so many times throughout the journey brother Jack said brother Jack said it brother Jack said and so um during this time we wanted to also go to a brother Simba's wedding and because they were getting married and man we had already decided we also were going to take an anniversary trip we wanted to do all of that so we said well since we're gonna be over there why don't we go to Paris too and then one of the sisters from South Africa was like well since you're gonna be in Africa why don't you come down here too and so we had planned that was our plan we hadn't bought the tickets but we sat down and prayed and we said God we want to go on this trip we want to take an anniversary trip but we got this mountain in front of us and we had prayed for God to do something real specific to let us know that we could take this trip and come back and everything was going to be okay and he did it so we said all right we took the trip we went over there we enjoyed ourselves we came back but before we left they had approved everything they told us we need a certain amount of money but they told they I asked him I got an idea and I said well if I get a new job will that change anything and they said yeah that'll change everything you get a new job I didn't look because I didn't want a new job I loved working for me most company that's what I wanted to do and I was very happy so I told God I said well god I believe you can make away with me being right here because I don't want to move and I said if you want me to move from here for this season you're gonna have to pick me up and move me out of here because I'm not moving I'm not looking for a job and so one day I was sitting in my car and I got a email that said it was a scouting company never signed up for one and they said we're we're looking for someone to fill this position that I didn't tell me the company or anything like that I thought those were like scams but for some reason I said okay I'm gonna respond to this one and so I went on ahead I responded and they asked me if I could come in and I came in and I interviewed and I told you all about that the lady of she was like I really really like you and I think you're gonna fit in good here and so I went through the interview process with the company and I ended up getting the job and when I got the job the day of the weekend before me going into the job I cried I was just walking around the house I was sad I was like I don't want to leave me Mom I don't wanna leave a family company I just don't and the Lord led me to these scriptures the first scripture that came to mind was when um Mordecai told Esther and who knoweth whether thou are coming to the kingdom for such a time as this that was the first scripture that came to mind and also during that weekend the scripture of the day during that weekend was um in Exodus 33 15 it said and he said unto him if I presidents go not if that presidents go not with me carry us not up hits and I said God if this isn't where you want me to be then don't take me don't but if this is where you want me to be then giving me the strength of just endure to go through and I got there and it has been amazing it has been truly amazing my I was in a meeting with the CEO Oh and he said you are the fastest moving person that we have ever hired you're just moving up there it's quicker than anyone and I was in a meeting with the CEO and the CEO who walked in and he said you know she's gonna run this office one day you you all just watch and he he kind of laughed and he said no no I'm serious she is gonna run this office one day and the CBO said well praise the Lord praise the Lord all right and I was just like okay and that's your thing they say praise the Lord and they mend everything so um so um God has just really really been blessing me I'm this this month I'm supposed to be meeting with my boss and the CEO to get a promotion I'm really excited about that and even then they've got some other positions opening that they've already told me they want me to step into which is higher than the company but they told him I said well I'm just gonna kind of ride in and see what happens and we'll see you know the Lord leads and even one another sister from another church I was able to get her in to get a job and on Monday a young lady came into the job and she had on a skirt and um and she said Betty works with me and she said you know I see you and Betty come in here every day with your skirts and I said if Rachel and Betty can wear a skirt I can wear a skirt wearing skirts to work right so she said that to me and then later Betty won't talk to me she said notice Katie had on a skirt and I said yeah go talk to and so she wouldn't talk to her and she said it's saying her to say the same thing to Benny and it was just to me that was just amazing that we were just being us you know but we didn't even realize somebody was watching that and she came in with her skirt so anyways when I got the job we sent the the the offer letter off to the people for the for the house and we said this this should be good and we were going through a different company than the the people that we're building the home you're going through a different mortgage company but they said hey as long as the terms are the same will honor that will honor it and we'll still pay the closing costs well when we added me on to the loan it changed the terms we didn't realize that until right before we were leaving for the wedding um maybe maybe not even a week before we leave it for later by this time we had a closing date that was like 21 days away and our company the company is building a home calls us and said we aren't paying your closing costs because the terms aren't the same we were like wait what what happened and they said well when you added Rachel to the loan you change the terms so we're not playing your pay your closing costs so we said well if you if we go through you then can we do the closing costs like that I mean would we be able to get it like that and they said yeah but your your date is like 20 days away and y'all are going out of town y'all want across the country so we're not gonna be a minute out of the country so we're not gonna be able to we may not be able to do this so we said all right we're just gonna believe God we said start the process and we'll see what happens so while we were over there we were just praying that God would make away God would make away and when we got back I mean they move so quick we closed in like two weeks okay by the time we got back since in our paperwork got everything done we closed they told us we had to get the insurance on the home and everything like that they messed up the insurance stuff royally and the day before we were supposed to do our walkthrough to the house make sure everything was okay the insurance stuff went through everything went through for the insurance and so when we sat down to actually close on the house they started talking us about the finances they said so we paid your closing costs but you had extra money left over so we paid your encho HOA for almost a year but you had extra money left over so we paid your your insurance for a year but you had extra money left over so we put the rest towards a down payment for your house so your down payment plus this brings your price down to this and the number I had in my head that I wanted us to pay monthly was the number it all came out soon and oh yeah so when they paid everything down and they rely and then because we're doing this they did a whole bunch of stuff nearly we're gonna drop your interest rate too so then they dropped our interest rate [Applause] yeah it was it was a really really big blessing so we leave we've come in and just been like ahead of the game moving into the house and things of that nature it's been like a real blessing um that God was able to bring all of that together in just such a short amount of time we didn't even ace we didn't know we don't know how so this is date how it all came together and how God just made away and we didn't pay a penny more than what we wanted to spend we didn't need a penny more than what once it's been that God just gave an overabundance of money to where they had to basically find places to put money in order to just take up that amount and that that really just helped out tremendously so we were in the house for a couple of months and this even comes to me and he says I want to get you a new car no I loved my car I had no problem with my car until some people had a problem with my car but I love my car I loved it and I told him I don't want a new car buy a new car and he said that for a couple months I want to get you in your car I want to get you in their car so eventually I told him I said on I'll go to the dealership with you I'll go so we went to the dealership and I found a car way out of our price range and I said well that's the only car I like and he said well we can't get that and I said well we just can't get a new car and so he left and then I started looking and I was like okay you know I'll look in outlook so we went back to the look at another car that I said if we get a new car I can I can do this I can do this so we went back to the look at that and I told the guy said you have this car on your site and he said um well I I don't see it in our life but it's on your site so it's got to be here somewhere and he said well he he when he checked it out he said oh no it's at a maintenance place something or another and it'll be back here tomorrow which was a Friday and he said come back tomorrow I said Church I can't come back he said we'll come back Saturday knew he had something going on Saturday I don't remember what it was I said can't come back he said well what about Sunday I said well I got Church I can't come back and and that Sunday was like a packed Sunday so we couldn't come back he's like you do have to go to church yes like yeah we're not coming here instead of going to church that's just not happening so Steven saw some trucks sitting over to the side and he said well while you talk to him I'm just gonna go look at these trucks and he walked over and um I'm just talking to the guy talking to the guy and I noticed Steven just ain't came back and I'm like okay so I look back and I see him standing by my car now and he's like you know yeah I said okay and it's just his car just sitting all by itself off to the side away from all the rest of the parts and I come over I'm looking at it I'm like I like this this is real nice but man I don't need a new car I don't want it on and she was like no I think I think I think there was no paperwork on the car so the guy had no clue what the car was or anything he had to go inside and try to figure out the paperwork going into pricing and all that other stuff so I had another number in my head I was like this is how much I want to pay for the monthly payments this is where I want to be and I found another car that I liked and we pulled that one up next to this one now and I just looked back and forth and I was like that's my car that's my car so make the numbers work we went inside they made all the numbers where they didn't we didn't even have to go back and forth with them what I had in my head where we want it to be that's where the numbers ended up coming out anyway so we didn't even have to go back and forth and I got my new car and so I'm like super grateful for how God has just worked in our lives this entire year it's just kind of amazing listening knowing that at the beginning of the year so many people were praying for cars and in homes and to hear us all come back and say I got a house I got houses I got a house thing I got a car you know back and forth I also want to just thank God even for when we were having communion on Sunday and we heard all the brothers worshiping over here and the sisters were like you know we thank God for that and I thought back and I think I was for it either sister Rebekah sister Sarah like there was a time where it was only brother Jack and Caleb thank you you know just the two of them and now it was like just a roar of brothers over there it's I just really thank God for just bringing so many brothers and not just that like you know the prayers that we have and the services that we've had and the fast set the fast thing that we do together as a church I see the the changes within the church I see the changes in the character of the church the growth of the church and then I see restoration like little things that I see God just her story and people that I see God we're sorry that you know it's nothing that God that just brought back in and a lot of times like God makes subtle changes and we'll miss them you know we'll miss it but it's like we're I don't know if we're expecting a mass group to just come in and we're missing the little things and the subtle changes that he I mean I just looked around on Sunday and I was like wow you know Wow God you God did that thing you did that thing and I'm just truly grateful where I see that God has just blessed our church of the year of the incredible wasn't just natural even though the majority of the church god I mean when we come to church that parking lot that's a beautiful parking beautiful parking lot God really blessed us all naturally but um yeah I see the spiritual things as well and I'm just truly grateful that God has answered so many prayers that we've had even over the years and just thanking God for the new church and he's gonna take us into and and looking at the numbers I mean I remember coming to church in here and about the building fund hearing about the building fund and then it just seemed like something just clicked and we all just work together and every time I see those numbers I just get encouraged I got is just gonna do something great for us if he can give us houses he can give us a house I truly believe that I have to just add on to substance Rachel said when we know those numbers and this will oh it'll be more in Jane wears out I'll tell you where it is now I'm giving you out 2019 numbers I haven't given you up 2018 plus 2019 numbers but we have a little over seventy thousand dollars in the bank [Applause] we're building it fun this church has never never had money like that so when we say you're incredible I had this I just get incurred I'm no God Gary do some with that money I know a church some such somebody got the sale you know or just give it to us or they don't know sister Dickson where you coming to testify that's how you move up into that seat you can come home you can come home yes okay but my wife is coming a second time and I can't have everybody come and sneak attack I ain't know your head you had your testimony okay I don't right praise the Lord all right a mate after after my wife I got one more and that's gonna be it for tonight all right but anyway there's nothing on my heart for a reason most likely the Lord wanted to share and I've just been thinking it at home and I said you know I love to share that testimony with a young people but it was way back in the eighties sure they after I come into the mess and not too long I just stayed in them books and tapes and all my kids come when I first call went to sister Lewis house and I was sitting she got to take the plan and it's not the testimony but I promise I'm gonna punish door and I was just God you know she was talking about something else and I'm trying to listen to the church but to the to the tape because that just felt some connection just like some kind of you know something the current making connection there and I'm like and I start to get in the hotel it was books and getting in them and oh this is what I've been praying for this what I've been looking searching for here or there I mean from place to place on the women preacher and all but anyway it was in the late eighties after had you know got sell it in the mess that you know I wasn't working at that time I was supposed to be storing at home for making a living but I wasn't after I get the kids off to school I would uh don't do my devotion for it's getting them books and when I look up the kids coming home from school and I'm still sitting there with the book and I had such a burden for my family all my family you know to be safe to come into this and one day I don't remember what message I'm sorry my little horse uh I don't remember what message I was reading but I just tears running down and I said Lord we need him here now now and that still small voice you know that when he speaks you will know you know it's it's he and but it's I don't know I get a looking fused on this part oh I don't remember if he said but he is I mean the still small voice you know it said that he is and I don't remember if he said but he is all he is here now you know you didn't say it here now he just said but he he's here not right and it was so real today and I can immediately I knew that it was from the Lord and it just it just said something over me and I would just just oh it's just so amazing because I never had that experience and I was just excited and about a year after that the word for word I heard it come over the uptake and I'm like wow that's the confirmation you know even though I did at that time when that first happened I had already heard enough about the Prophet and gotten a message enough to know that this is what I was looking for this is what something in me had been calling for him to know that he was really a true prophet of God but then after I heard it all on a tape by the year later I heard that heard it again on the tape of the second time and I said while I didn't need a confirmation but he gave me the to confirmation you know and I've been on the tackle of the lately attacking my body but you know when the enemy comes it don't phrase me because I know he's here he's in control and I thank him every day for calories because my healing was then that my Redemption and I just I have so many things I could share with y'all that tells the moment like how God uphill matured and I wouldn't dare use the wouldn't dare go to the doctor stop taking my children I had to slip around and pray for them because my husband would be fussing but anyway God how did it [Applause] [Applause] boy did that thing that's alright a man sister Erica a man we'll have you come at this time praise the Lord god bless you I'll make this quick um I actually thought about it and then I was like you've already shared it so I'm just gonna leave it but but I thought about it again when my mother said how we actually my mom and sister Charisse how they were talking about the accidents and just being on the road and praying and all of that you know and how we pray for you know kind of specific things you know Lord be an angel you know I mean set your angels around us too you know and in your mind you're thinking you know accidents or you know reckless drivers things like that you don't think of other things and so I just wanted to thank God for something I shared it with the sisters and the sister group the other night but um I want to thank God for something that happened on Monday night to me I was on my way home Monday night from downtown I had gone to the Kravis Center for something for the volunteer place that I go to out at the fairgrounds so I went to to this event and was on my way back home and you know the time has changed so it's dark at night so I was on my way back home and as I'm coming down Okeechobee Boulevard I know I hear somebody blowing and it's two cars as we were turning onto Okeechobee as two turning lanes the two cars I guess I'm assuming because I was a little ahead of them I'm assuming like one turned into the other person's lane and that's why they're blue so you know I looked in my rearview mirror and I see that and then I see a car speed up you know ahead of me like to get around that then that card got in and got in front of me so it's you know it's these three cars in line so I'm just driving along and all of a sudden that car that's in front of me kind of goes over to the right lane like he's gonna get on to 95 from Okeechobee Boulevard and then all of a sudden he goes goes right over into the left lane and stops in the left lane nobody was over there so I'm look I'm you know as I'm he stops I'm like this person has lost what are they doing you know so I just kind of slowed down a little bit and went by them you know just went on buying my lane so I'm seeing as we're coming up that traffic is just a mess and I'm thinking you know in my mind is six o'clock something that's the downtown traffic and all of that so I'm going and now the traffic's starting to get a little heavy and that car gets over and gets behind me and it's right up on me so um the traffic is getting heavy and everybody's emerging over to the left lane so I'm in the center lane and at this point it had opened up to like I think the five lanes where you can get on 295 so everybody's kind of coming over so so I move over just to kind of head off you know and get around everybody else that's trying to come over and that car moves over behind me then I ended up having to move over again because the cards from over here we're trying to get over so I moved over again the car moved again behind me so at this point now I'm looking I'm looking at this car so we're coming and then I move over again and that car gets behind me again so so at this point I'm really like okay so as we're getting ready to go over the hill um I see that you know now I can see what's going on and down the hill at the PD right in front of the PDQ it's a big accident so that's why the traffic's all coming together because is you know the firetruck and all this stuff is you know in the road so all the traffic is coming together so I get over to you know to get into the lane that's you know that's open that car comes over and gets behind me so I'm sitting there you know and we can't go anywhere the light is green but it's just it's traffic everywhere all around me so this car sitting behind me so um I was looking down and I looked up and then I looked down I looked down at my phone for a split second next thing I know somebody comes and knocks on the door and knocks on the window so I look and there's a guy standing there and so I you know so I wrote down my window like this and and I looked at him but then I'm thinking okay you know all these cars around ain't nothing you know so I rolled it down a little bit more and he goes hey how you doing I'm like I'm fine and he's like I'm I don't know if you noticed that I kept getting behind you and I said yeah and I said I did actually and he says well um the reason I was on the phone use because your um your your backlight it's blinking your backlight is blinking and I said my black backlight and he said yeah it's flashing and you know and I said well which one and he said you know my side and I said okay and he said well it's police all around you you can't be too careful you know how they are and you know you just got to be careful and I said okay thank you I appreciate it he's like yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah that's that's why I'm all behind you like that and I was like okay so I just rolled my window up and you know when the traffic starts going so I go and as I'm going he's following me still so by this time is the traffic is is it's flowing but it's very heavy so my car can go really fast so I found an open lane and I just took off I took off and I took off and then I moved over into a lane right quick and he he got over and took off tried to take off behind me but he got stuck it was a slower car that I moved over in front of so he got stuck and we got stopped at another light and you know and I just tried to keep an eye keep an eye on his headlights but his car was black and it was dark so I really couldn't tell you know so I just took off and I just you know kept going down Okeechobee and I said you know what I'm not going home so I turned into I turned into that old Kmart please' and I just drove around the plaza and stopped like I was getting that and then went somewhere else and stopped like I was getting out and Dean came over and finally I stopped somewhere where it was well-lit and I got out and I went into the store and so I stayed in the store a little while probably about 20 minutes and then you know I came out gingerly looking in the parking lot and went on and got back in the car and you know and came on home and watched as I came home you know but um I was telling him you know I told him and he was like no that don't sound right you know and I was thinking the same thing that did not sound right so I said you know what Laura thank you for forgiving me just having me conscious of my surroundings you know as a as a woman you you kind of always are but sometimes things like that you don't really think about you know you think of like I said before you think about accidents you think about reckless drivers drunk drivers you think about all that stuff but you don't think about you know there's truly some evil people in this world and they they mean you know good you know you don't think about those things so I just thank God for just putting it in me to even pay attention to this car moving by cuz you know I listen when I'm ready to get home I'm just going home you know but putting I saw it from the beginning to the end I saw exactly when he started following me and all of that and I just thank God for for him just giving me the you know the conscious thought to actually see this and to head it off before because I really honestly I truly scared me I really believe that that man meant me no good so I thank God for that that's one number two is we up here and we all have all these you know great things that we're thinking God for and you know a lot of times you know and these are things that maybe the little ones don't understand you know I mean a house a car you know new job you know sometimes that they don't understand it but it don't it doesn't translate because they don't want a house they don't want a car they don't want you know so I just I just knew I had to actually bring this particular one because first of all because it was something I was praying for and like brother brother Clinton said you know God even sees the smallest things you know and it was something that I was praying for it was something that I was not I mean my stomach was turning over but it's something that God showed up in and what it is y'all gonna probably laugh but my cat was sick okay he was sick and I he was sick and really I felt like he was sick unto death my cat you know many y'all don't know this y'all seen my cat before but I don't know I got that cat from josue years ago like literally almost 17 18 years ago I got this cat at six months old from Josue ok brother looks way I'm sorry and so my cat is literally 135 years old ok so um you know I just started thinking about one time before when he got sick and my girls were young they were like this age they were young and and and you know that the the vet told us that it was going to be this much and I was like it's a cat yeah that's just a thought that I had and they were like but can we pray can't you know and my oldest one when they got her piggy bank and had like five dollars in it it was like can we pay for this you know an event one is $500 okay you know so but you know we laugh at their but two kids that's something you know so um anyway my cat we put him out the house probably about three weeks ago okay he like I said he oh and he just had incontinence problems he was just going everywhere and so I had to put him out the house you know so we put them out how and I'm like it whatever it is it'll clear up and he'll be okay you know he'll be okay so well he wasn't getting okay I'm for it unfortunately escalated and then he he had blood in his urine and I was like oh my gosh his kidneys his kidney oh he did he's gonna die and I'm serious I just I would go and he can't hear all that well so I would go to the patio and knock on the patio and he wouldn't move and I'm like all he did it would just be I would literally wake up every morning and walk out there expecting to see him dead you know okay and and and and I was like you know what Lord I just I can't you know and for the sake of you know my yeah the girls are big grown they grow now but I just felt bad for them you know I was like and they were like take him to the duck you're gonna take him to the doctor now yeah I'm gonna take him but honestly y'all I kept putting off taking I've kept putting on taking him kept putting cuz I felt like they was gonna put my cat down and I just didn't wanna I didn't want to have to deal with that you know and so to anybody who have had pets you you understand hey put it this way you've had them and you love them okay you would understand how I feel so so anyway finally it came to the day different ones kept asking me you take a whisper you figure with yes okay you came to the day I took whisp okay so I took them to the doctor now y'all got to realize this cat is literally on his last life nine lives okay he done been through some stuff okay he done jumped off buildings up me buildings but I benefit I fell off the banister done he done did all kind of stuff y'all so I'm really thinking this it for him this it for him and so I go in we talked to the man what's the problem you know we talked to the receptionist guy and I'm telling them he's about all that's not good so you here friend her life and I'm like I hope not no so we go you know and bring them into the room and they coming in you know we gotta take some blood tests and we gotta do your analysis and all of this stuff and and I thank God for those people because they were so sweet to him and he was comfortable you know I was afraid cuz he hate going in the car but he was very comfortable with him and everything so I'm just waiting on these tests to come back to say look you need to do something about this cat you know he's suffering he you know all of these things that they love to say you know so I'm just waiting and I'm hearing the lady in the room next to me with a hook hat and they like you okay kidney failure and and you know we gonna make them comfortable their way and I'm like oh gosh you know so I'm just sitting there thinking thinking you know and just kind of praying to myself and all this time I've been trying to not act like a you know I've been trying to be the strong one you know I know yeah you know he'll be okay in my mind or whatever but I was really worried so anyway the doctor comes in he goes and he looks at him he's like boy you're a old fella aren't you you know and he's playing with him he goes um I'm gonna tell you for a cat this old he's in great condition and I'm late really and he said his kidneys are in great condition um he probably just has a little UTI or something we're gonna give him antibiotic for I mean he has a little heart murmur I mean eventually that might take him out but other than that I'm he's a good guy I'm surprised that he's in such good condition and I'm thinking to myself problem too and he's like just take them home given this for ten days and you know if that doesn't help bring them back and we'll see you know we'll see we'll see what happens but I mean he's in great condition and I'm like thank you Lord because I prayed I did pray for him and I think he prayed we prayed as a family for him and you know just something just that small this small to some you know it's small to some people to me is my dad but to some people it's like I was just so you know oh you know but you know it just it just goes to show like brother Quinton say God looks at the small things and the things that might be important to us might not be the same thing to them but just to show them that look God cares even about what's important but the thing that might seem small to us but what's important to you and your life God cares about it so don't think that anything is too small to pray for because God is listening and if it's important to you it's important to him [Applause] yeah Pok is a little lighter a man brother symbol is gonna be our last testimony tonight he's gonna come at this time and share praise the Lord baby man a small horoscope to me is that it was the same from up higher than the children of this reality later take a card the same thing on another tape same vilify he is here go bless you Saints such an encouragement to come here and just listen to all these testimonies you know what God is doing in his children's lives it's an encouragement because you know it's it proves to us that you know we're not doing this in vain you know we're not serving him in vain we're not praying in vain you know it was Tuesday night / if it's Tuesday night prayers prayers in our homes not praying the bank cuz he's offering those prayers and we know it also proves to us that you know he's still he's still living God you know he's still a protector you know he's still a HeLa healed brother Garen's back he's still provided up providing homes mat providing cause fighting jobs and even providing things that you know we didn't ask for that's providing businesses know so many things that you know that God is doing that just proves that he's still alive and we're not we're not serving him in in vain that's right and you know the the blessing of it is just knowing that we're a group of people that recognizes that that was God you know we we recognize and see that in all these things that was God because in in in you know the average personal you have a Christian they might not see God in the things that you're seeing God yes so that's kind of when my testimony is is coming from just recognizing and seeing God in just everything that happens around us and it's it's it's a continuation of the testimony that I gave last time we had a testimony service where I gave a testimony about how the Lord had spoken to me and given me a confirmation about which house to buy when I was in my husband house buying process and I come down to you know the last two houses that my wife and I really liked and you know I was kind of having mind battles of which one to choose and it was the first one that I got to see and the last one that I've gone to see and the last one happened to be the eighth one and solves you know it's just and I know things don't just happen by coincidence so you know I was wondering you know what you know what was the meaning behind number eight you know and I didn't know what the number eight meant and I prayed about it and I prayed about the whole process and that the same day I prayed the morning in the same day during the service it was on Sunday same day joint service God answered that prayer and used the preacher to to preach about the anointing of King David and how when he was when when Samuel have gone to Jesse's house they went through you know seven seven of his kids and it was on the eighth one that that's that's the he anointed David and I was wondering about eight nine pretty just prayed for God to tell me what you know the significance of eight was and then further Jack said you know you know eight is a special number it has meaning then he went ahead and told us what eight eight means which is new beginning for those that weren't there for me that was my confirmation because of just everything that had happened in my life you know leading up to that point with God changing my life to two years ago and just doing certain things and just getting me to that point and allowing me to leave saying losers you know so only city I've known since I moved to to the u.s. leaving my friends leaving my lifestyle there even leaving my family my brother's still there and just selling everything and packing everything the card coming here because I wanted to serve the Lord you know I wanted to be around you know a good church I want to be around good Saints you know so for me this was starting a new chapter and I was about to get married you know this is a new season in my life so so it really was a new beginning so anyway to to to carry on from there so I just you know when then I went when all that happened I was just sitting at home and I was just just just in all what God had done you know just thinking about you know just how surreal everything felt right just I was thinking myself I am I am I really here you know am I am I really working from home you know am I did I come here without having to jump through you know the the hurdles that someone would have to jump through is the a foreigner would have to jump through to change jobs and all that you know am I might now part of you know the best church you know am i around you know the some of the best people I know come on you know you know and I just buy a house and I you know am I about to get married you know all these things and just think about it just felt so surreal and I remember telling my friends that a man I I I'm truly living my dream you know and that's that's best is really how I felt and that's how I felt all this time and so in all that I was just looking back at how God had worked everything out and just given me a system change you know two years prior you know and how he just worked everything out since then and how he had even like exceeded my expectations you know and how he had been in you know little details about the journey you know I was just looking at all of that and I was just thinking to myself man you know God God is good you know and so it's nice thing about you know all that stuff there's a thought that that that came to me and that thought was that you know there's more to your house number than just a house number right right but when I thought at first you know I just thought it was a thought you know I thought maybe I was just riding off of the whole eight things so now I'm trying to look for things so I didn't think too much of it and you know as you know they went weeks went that thought just kept coming back into this and there's more to your house number than just the house number and I now brush it's a brushed aside and before you know that thought is back again so because it can reoccur in I I was like Manhattan maybe I should look into what you know my help me know the meaning of my house number and so my house numbers 320 and so I thought myself you know I mean we know there's certain numbers in the Bible that just that's you know that they're mentioned a lot of times that have me you can thing you know the number three you know number five you know seven you know eight that I learned about when brother Jack was preaching 12 you know seventeen forty fifty you know there's certain numbers that you know you know carry some kind of meaning but three 320 I didn't even know where it starts to look to kind of figure out you know what what 320 meant so you know I brushed it aside and it kept reappearing in this there's more to house number than just a house number so one day I was thinking about it and a thought just came to me and said maybe it's not 320 maybe it's a chapter three verse 20 and so I thought well okay I hadn't thought of that so you know the little Ino lid I'll look into it it's pretty much all that what I told myself and then I didn't and the thought just kept coming back you know she kept coming back 303 320 320 and so one day I had time and I was like okay I actually let me look through the Bible to see if there's any book in the Bible that has a chapter 3 and verse 20 that has some sort of significance to my life or my situation or to this journey so I started going through from from the Old Testament going through Genesis you know look through each book and you know so you know most most of the books had a chapter a chapter 3 some didn't have a verse 20 some did have a first 20 but it just it didn't have any significance to my life and some some books didn't have a chapter 3 so I kept going and I went through the whole Old Testament and then I started on a New Testament so as I was going through the New Testament you know started you know Matthew Mark Luke John and I'm and I'm going and then I got to to Ephesians and Ephesians kind of chapter 3 and Ephesians had a verse 20 so I got to you fees in Ephesians chapter 3 and first 20 and I read Ephesians chapter 3 verse 20 now bear in mind how I've been thinking about just just how god it works in my life and how he had changed my life you know two years ago and how he had done so many things and moved mightily and exceeded my expectations and been in every single little detail about the whole journey right and so with that in mind night I get to features three the first twenty and I read it and as soon as I read I said glory to God this is the reason why I never kept ringing in my mind you know because God God was still in the details it was just a house number I know there was a verse in there let's go directly to my situation and so so so when I read I was like oh man and and and and the verse says now unto him that is able to do exceeding abundantly above all we can ask or think according to the power that worketh in US alright unto him be the glory alright so I read that and I was like oh my gosh this is why this was um in my mind all this time and and and this is why there was that that there's that voice that just kept saying there's more to your house number and now God has revealed himself in something that is simple you know so I just started thinking myself and I was like man this is nothing but the truth all right God has exceeded my expectation is expectation you know there are when I was praying to come here I was praying for an opportunity to be in Florida and I was praying for a job in Florida the house was never a thing that I prayed for until I knew our body you know by a house of it oh you know you know I guess I'm playing house I start praying but when I was thinking of coming here when I was praying about coming here my prayer was to get a job here and to move here alright and and I in my head and I told my my my my fiancee then my wife that when I get here I'm gonna get an apartment and I'm just gonna see you know we're gonna get married Oh settle down once we'll wholesale maybe after a year or so we'll think about buying a home so buying a home was never in my plans but that's an expectation that God acceded back and just the way that he brought me here I in my head when I was praying about all of this in my head I thought the realistically I would come here middle of 2019 or about the end of 2000 about you know this time or you know July you know time about or about round about this time is what I thought was realistic but he exceeded that expectation and for me here end of twenty nine pretty 18 right and I started the year here you know he exceeded that expectation you know and how she's thinking about I was like God God is good man and he's just revealed himself in in in this stage and even just um the way he worked out me coming here and me not having to jump through the hurdles you know hoops and hurdles that you I was who's and hurdles prepares to jump to get here I didn't have to he just opened the Red Sea and allowed me just walk on dry ground and not have to face anything and so I was a man God you really did accede to all my expectations in this whole thing and so when I was just thinking about just just how what you know you just just get everything that happened with you know just discovering that verse and just seeing God and in something so simple and how God revealed himself to me I revealed an attribute of himself or the attribute of being able to do abundantly above I just I just thought myself man I'm I'm so grateful for the message now I'm so grateful to be a believer because when when you are a believer or when when you become a believer naturally you just start to look at things spiritually all right and a lot of the testimonies here like I said we're saying testimonies because we see God in them right the same thing like I say it could happen to the average Christian an average person and they might attribute it to good fortune or we no chance or I know but we as believers see God in it you ask the important things because it was supposed to give credit where it's due all right like like like a brother Solomon gave credit to me for my video editing skills good thing is that we recognize that this is the work of God and as a believer it's important for us to have spiritual eyes and spiritual ears right that's why the Bible in Revelation says you know either have an ear let him hear what the Spirit is saying to church right in Matthew 13 said you know blessed are your eyes for they see your ears for they hear right right there's a certain type of ear right that you need to hear that right there's a certain type of eye you need to see Matt right why would the Bible say he that hath an ear let him hear we all have ears right right but there's a certain type of here yeah that you need to hear all right I you need to see God moving right so I was just thinking about all of that and so I was thinking about all that and I was thinking you know God God is a great God right God can speak mildly and he can move mightily but the same God can move in simplicity and he can move in simple things right right the Prophet even preached a sermon on God hiding himself in simplicity Ryan revealing himself in the same I know and I looked at I was like God hid himself in 3:20 and he revealed himself to me reveal attribute to me in that simple thing that maybe someone might not even think about right so I was thinking about what I was thinking about that and I was like you know our God God like I said God can move speak Michael your move my lead right God can speak mythili you know by thundering from heaven right God can and move mightily and speak mighty by we know that from the word by appearing in the burning bush and speaking through it right God can come down in the form of a cloud and speak to the cloud we know that from the word right but God can also use a brother all right like I don't remember someone saying I think it was it was it was a rod Solomon talking about just text or conversations we have our fire God can speak through a brother God and speak to a sister God God can can can move through what someone else could call good fortune all right God can speak to a song that someone comes up to sing right and and the thing is our our our natural eyes and our natural ears can only take us so far and our favor right if God thundered my spoke mightily and thundered from heaven our natural is good here that the same God spoke right right if God appeared in a burning bush and spoke to us we could see what the natural island is a burning bush there and voices coming out of that supernatural right and we we could we can always say you know we experienced Coca's now supernatural i right but what about when he uses the foolishness of preaching all right right what about when he uses a sister to send the text or to have a conversation with you know what about when someone comes up to sing a song oh you know what about when III heard testimony the one time of someone a believer whose life was changed because of our strangest
