[10:20] Revelation tonight Lord because you are
[10:22] the great rator Lord and father we thank
[10:25] you for letting us be here once again
[10:27] Lord knowing Lord that you've made it
[10:29] safely for us to be here Lord God Just
[10:31] Have Your Way in Jesus Christ's name we
[10:33] pray amen and amen we're opening
[10:36] scripture will be in uh Psalms
[10:40] 46 verses 1- 11 very familiar scriptures
[10:44] in the Bible and so say Amen when you
[10:47] get there let me just see something real
[10:49] quick just bother me little
[10:53] bit all right so uh says the Bible says
[10:57] God is our refuge
[11:00] and strength a very present help in
[11:04] trouble therefore will we not fear
[11:07] though the Earth be removed and the
[11:10] mountains be carried to the midst of the
[11:12] sea it's more though the waters
[11:14] therefore Roar and be troubled though
[11:16] the mountains shake with the swelling
[11:18] thereof silah there is a river the
[11:21] streams whereof shall make glad the city
[11:24] of God the holy place of the Tabernacles
[11:27] of the most high God God is in the midst
[11:30] of her she shall not be moved amen God
[11:34] shall help her and that right and early
[11:37] the Heathen raged and the kingdoms were
[11:39] moved he uttered he uttered his voice
[11:43] the Earth melted the Lord of host is
[11:46] with us the god of Jacob is our refuge
[11:49] Salah think about that come and behold
[11:52] the works of the Lord what desolations
[11:55] that he made in the earth he maketh Wars
[11:58] to cease unto the end of the Earth he
[12:01] breakthe bow he cutteth the spear in a
[12:03] sun he burneth The Chariot in the fire
[12:06] verse 10 be still and know that I am God
[12:11] I will be exalted among the Heathen I'll
[12:14] be exalted in the Earth the Lord of
[12:16] hosts is with us the god of Jacob is our
[12:20] refuge Salah so I look the word up
[12:24] refuge in the old Webster's Dictionary
[12:27] and the Bible and it says shelter or
[12:30] protection from danger or distress that
[12:33] which shelters or protects from danger
[12:36] distress or Calamity so if all these
[12:39] things going in our life that is trying
[12:41] to bring us down it's trying to take our
[12:43] eyes away from this Refuge that we have
[12:45] you may be
[12:47] seated you may be seated so we have this
[12:50] Refuge that is accessible at all times
[12:53] of the day no matter if you wake up at
[12:55] 3:00 in the morning no matter if it's
[12:56] 10:00 at night that Refuge is accessible
[12:59] and a lot of times I think we forfeit
[13:01] The Refuge that we have in Christ Jesus
[13:03] and so I love the Bible said he is our
[13:05] refuge and strength a very present help
[13:08] in the time of trouble you don't have to
[13:09] just wait for trouble to get inside the
[13:11] Refuge he's he's available at all times
[13:14] amen so I want you to notice that Refuge
[13:16] is is mentioned three times in Psalms 46
[13:19] right there three times and what is
[13:21] three Perfection Perfection amen and uh
[13:25] so David is trying to tell us that God
[13:27] is your personal Refuge
[13:29] not only David's refuge in the Old
[13:31] Testament but he's your Refuge today
[13:33] because the Bible says Jesus Christ the
[13:35] same yesterday today and forever so if
[13:37] he's a refuge back in that time he's a
[13:39] refuge in this time as
[13:41] well and so I remember uh some years ago
[13:44] I was over a friend's house and he had
[13:45] this uh this uh picture of what be still
[13:48] really meant cuz people think be still
[13:50] is just you're still but this is what it
[13:52] means in the Hebrew so be still and know
[13:54] that I am God the original Hebrew root
[13:57] be still doesn't mean be quiet it means
[14:00] let go think about that a lot of times
[14:03] we don't let go in a situation we're not
[14:04] being still in a situation because we
[14:07] want to have control in the situation
[14:08] because we're scared to let we're scared
[14:10] to see what the outcome will be so he
[14:12] says um let go that's a very different
[14:15] don't you think and you know that I am
[14:17] God let go of trying to control your
[14:19] spouse let go of your worry about your
[14:22] finances let go of your unforgiveness
[14:25] let go of your past let go what you
[14:27] cannot control and rest in the knowledge
[14:30] that God is in control so that's what be
[14:33] still really means is to let go like
[14:35] that song let go and let God have his
[14:37] wonderful way amen and now let's let's
[14:40] go to Psalms 91
[14:46] now amen and read verse we'll start with
[14:49] verse
[14:51] one so it says the Lord that has been
[14:55] our Dwelling Place in all generations so
[14:57] think about that he is your Dwelling
[14:59] Place he was a dwelling place for
[15:01] Abraham for Moses for Jeremiah but now
[15:04] he's your dwelling place as well and
[15:07] we'll go to Proverbs 18:10 this is
[15:09] another good one I
[15:11] love it's another very familiar one it
[15:14] says the name of the Lord is a strong
[15:17] tower I'm going read that again the name
[15:19] of the Lord is a strong tower and what
[15:21] the righteous runneth into it and is
[15:23] safe see the bride in this day and age
[15:25] in every age she had this righteousness
[15:28] she had this uh this tower that she can
[15:29] run into but a lot of times we fail to
[15:32] run into the tower because we let life
[15:35] dis engulf us but don't let life engulf
[15:37] you but let the Lord engulf you amen
[15:40] because he's your peace he he's your
[15:42] everything he's your life without him we
[15:45] would have nothing amen so let's keep
[15:48] going let's go to uh verse um let's go
[15:51] back to Psalms 90 let's go to Psalms 91
[15:54] now this is a very good Psalm right here
[15:56] I think it's something that it fits this
[15:59] day and age so
[16:00] 91:1 he that dwelleth in the secret
[16:03] place of the most high shall abide under
[16:06] the shadow of the almighty that's what
[16:07] we need to be dwelling day and night
[16:09] verse two I will say of the Lord he is
[16:11] look look at word again my
[16:14] refuge and my Fortress and and the word
[16:18] uh Fortress is any fortified place a
[16:22] fort a castle a stronghold a place of
[16:25] defense or security there's more the
[16:28] English have a strong fortress on the
[16:30] rock of jalter or the rock that is a
[16:32] fortress defense safety security you
[16:35] can't be safe and protected if you live
[16:37] outside that Fortress so back in the day
[16:39] when they lived in those type of things
[16:41] they they lived in there to have
[16:43] protection and
[16:44] safety but the type of Fortress that we
[16:46] have no man can destroy it no man can
[16:49] pick it apart there's no atomic bomb
[16:52] that can blow it up it's always and
[16:54] forever will be Eternal and it's a place
[16:56] that we need to abide in Daily because a
[16:58] lot of times we go through unnecessary
[17:01] stress that God doesn't want us to go
[17:03] through because we're not in that
[17:04] Fortress we're not fortified away in
[17:06] Christ Jesus let's keep going I will
[17:08] save the Lord he is my refuge and my
[17:10] Fortress I always said this before look
[17:12] at that word he says my my is so
[17:15] important you got to experience that for
[17:16] yourself my God in him will I trust
[17:20] surely he shall deliver thee From The
[17:22] Snare of the Fowler and from the
[17:24] nonsense of the pestilence he shall
[17:26] cover thee talking to you right now he
[17:28] shall cover thee with his feathers and
[17:30] under his wings Thou shalt trust his
[17:33] truth shall be thy shield and buckler
[17:38] Thou shalt not be afraid for the terror
[17:40] by night nor for the arrow that flyth by
[17:42] day nor for the pestilence that walketh
[17:44] in the darkness for the destruction that
[17:46] wasteth at noon day A thousand shall
[17:49] fall at thy side and 10,000 at thy right
[17:51] hand but it shall not come nigh to thee
[17:55] only with thy eyes Thou shalt behold and
[17:56] see the reward of the wicked because
[17:59] thou Hast made the Lord which is what my
[18:04] refuge even the most high thy habitation
[18:08] look at that there shall no evil Beall
[18:10] thee neither shall any plague come nigh
[18:12] thy dwelling for he shall give his
[18:14] angels charge over thee to keep thee in
[18:17] all thy ways they shall bear thee up in
[18:19] their hands lest thou Dash thy uh foot
[18:22] against the stone Thou shalt tread upon
[18:24] the lion and the adder the Young Lion
[18:26] and the dragon shall thou trample under
[18:27] the feet because he has set his look it
[18:30] says because he has set his love upon me
[18:33] we got to set our love upon the C our
[18:35] lord Jesus we got to we live in a day
[18:37] and age where where love is just it's
[18:41] not there anymore but we got to cling
[18:43] that much closer to Christ because we
[18:44] need the love of Christ ring radiating
[18:47] outside of us because he set his love
[18:49] upon me therefore will I deliver him I
[18:52] will set him on high because he has
[18:53] known my name he shall call upon me and
[18:57] I will answer and I will be with him in
[18:59] trouble same thing it says in Psalms
[19:02] 46:1 I will deliver him and honor him
[19:04] with long life I will satisfy him and
[19:06] show him my salvation now the word
[19:09] Shield means to cover as with a shield
[19:11] to cover from danger to defend to
[19:14] protect to secure from assault and we
[19:17] look uh last week we were talking about
[19:19] uh in the book of PS Book of Psalms the
[19:21] book of Ephesians how you have the
[19:22] shield of Faith The Shield of faith is
[19:24] important because it it quenches the
[19:26] fiery darts of the enemy so a shield is
[19:28] very important in an armor set and we
[19:31] got to make sure that we take the shield
[19:32] of Faith every day we need every piece
[19:34] of the armor of God that he's given us
[19:36] we can't leave one thing away and I I I
[19:39] want to say this statement right here
[19:40] the word refuge is used 85 times in the
[19:43] Book of Psalms think about that the Lord
[19:46] is trying to bring something to our
[19:47] attention that he is our refuge we don't
[19:49] have to go through this life alone
[19:50] trying to trying to struggle and find
[19:52] everything out ourselves but there's a
[19:54] refuge that we can go to any time of
[19:56] place but we have to be willing to to um
[19:59] humble ourselves and get into that admit
[20:01] when you're wrong sometimes you're not
[20:03] always right all the time and I I can I
[20:05] can attest to that because I used to
[20:06] have that mentality a lot that I know
[20:08] everything and life hits you sometimes
[20:11] and show you don't know
[20:12] everything let's go to Luke
[20:17] 16 so I I believe the day the day and
[20:20] age we're living in we got to be still
[20:22] we got to be willing to let go uh
[20:24] because God is trying to do something in
[20:26] our lives right now uh the Lord lord
[20:28] gave uh Pastor Jack uh restoration for a
[20:31] reason and God can't restore you if
[20:33] you're not willing to let go of the
[20:34] things that you need to let
[20:36] go see we hinder our blessings because
[20:39] we're not willing to let go we want to
[20:40] hold on to the driver's will but not let
[20:42] God get
[20:43] control so 16:16 it says the law and the
[20:47] prophets were until John since that time
[20:50] the kingdom of God is preached and every
[20:52] man presseth into it so you got to press
[20:55] into the kingdom of God and another
[20:57] rendition it says um
[20:59] uh talks about how that uh the Kingdom
[21:01] of Heaven suffered violence and the
[21:03] violent take it by force so we got to
[21:05] take our walk by force because we're
[21:07] going against a worthy adversary see you
[21:09] you can't underestimate what the devil
[21:11] can do see that's why the thing is you
[21:13] can't outsmart him with worldly wisdom
[21:16] you got to outsmart him by surrendering
[21:17] to God cuz that's the only thing that
[21:20] can ever defeat the Devil is is God God
[21:22] in his word Jesus showed us how to
[21:24] defeat the Devil not by intellect not by
[21:26] reasoning against him you look one thing
[21:28] Jesus did not reason with the devil not
[21:30] one time he said it is written thou
[21:32] offense get behind me he didn't get the
[21:34] devil no time of day but we get the
[21:36] devil a time a day we said man the devil
[21:38] puts a thought then we start pondering
[21:40] it pondering it then it becomes a
[21:42] manifestation and that's what the devil
[21:43] wants you to do that's where his traps
[21:45] he sets you he wants you to reason just
[21:47] like with Eve in the Garden of Eden if
[21:49] she would just stay if she would just
[21:50] stayed upon the word she never would
[21:52] have fail but what she did was she
[21:54] reason and say whoo that sounds good
[21:56] I've never heard that before but but God
[21:58] spoke already and she didn't follow it
[22:00] same thing in our life anytime that we
[22:02] go through something unnecessarily we
[22:04] have to go away from the word of God in
[22:06] order to fall so amen
[22:09] amen keep goinging I'm read a quote now
[22:12] so I I remember this quote years ago but
[22:15] it's so powerful and I think it's so
[22:16] it's so uh beautiful for the word the
[22:19] lord gave us restoration you just put
[22:21] one or two good members in the church
[22:23] that's really on fire for God it'll do
[22:26] something for that church more than than
[22:28] 40 revivals could I'm read that quote
[22:30] again I don't think you guys heard it
[22:31] you just put one or two good members in
[22:33] a church that's really on fire for God
[22:37] it'll do something for that church more
[22:39] than 40 revivals you could have think
[22:41] about that think about 40 revivals but
[22:43] Revival should be happen in our life
[22:45] every day we should be getting up and
[22:47] being revived in God because he's think
[22:50] about this the message of the hour has
[22:51] been revealed to us we have all the
[22:53] truth revealed to us the Bible's been
[22:55] open we should be the happiest people in
[22:58] the world in fact we should be the
[22:59] desper people in the world because the
[23:01] Bible says the Bride haath made herself
[23:03] ready also says the the bride will be
[23:05] out spot or wrinkle so in order for the
[23:08] bride to make herself ready she has to
[23:09] be desperate for restoration because
[23:12] what is God trying to restore us back to
[23:15] from the
[23:17] beginning see we got to catch the vision
[23:19] of restoration it's not just knowing
[23:21] about restoration but it's about
[23:22] catching the vision that God has for our
[23:24] church we we got to step into that
[23:27] Vision not not just knowing about but
[23:28] you got to step into that Vision that
[23:30] God has given to us just let just let
[23:33] him find one sincere heart that he can
[23:36] get into he will come any time any hour
[23:39] of the night I'm so thankful that we
[23:41] have a doctor that will come anytime oh
[23:44] I'm so happy to know for that to know
[23:47] he's my refuge and my strength the very
[23:50] present help in the time of
[23:52] trouble amen now the Lord is our refuge
[23:55] and strength a very present help in the
[23:57] time of trouble and the Redemptive names
[24:00] Shema the Lord is present so I want you
[24:02] to tell this right now the Lord is
[24:04] present right now in your situation you
[24:07] may not want to believe it or say oh I'm
[24:08] I'm in the toughest predicament in my
[24:10] life but the Lord is right there present
[24:12] in your situation you got to claim it by
[24:14] faith you got to believe it and he's
[24:16] going to show up time and time and time
[24:18] again time and time and time
[24:21] again amen so the Lord is present now
[24:24] Jehovah Gyra will provide so he's he's
[24:27] providing and he's present
[24:29] he's going to provide every need that
[24:30] you have need of not not your wants but
[24:32] your needs so Jehovah Jehovah the
[24:35] provider is present I love that Jehovah
[24:37] the provider is present you get what I
[24:41] mean if he's the Lord if if he's the
[24:45] Lord's provided sacrifice that he's got
[24:47] to be the Lord God present in that time
[24:49] of help now see what I mean now if here
[24:52] tonight if he's here tonight to save
[24:54] everybody from sin he's got to be
[24:56] present to tonight to fulfill the rest
[24:58] of the Redemptive names you believe that
[25:01] he's Jehovah Gyra Jehovah RFI Jehovah
[25:04] our provided sacrifice our healer our
[25:06] Banner our peace Our Shepherd our
[25:08] righteousness and his presence he's got
[25:10] to be all that right now the last thing
[25:12] so think about all those things we just
[25:13] said just now he's all those things to
[25:15] you personally amen often the the peace
[25:18] that we forfeit because we don't realize
[25:20] what Jehovah God really is to us I I
[25:23] think that's why brother Bram said we
[25:24] live uh we live a million miles below
[25:27] our privilege because we don't recognize
[25:28] what we have in God we have everything
[25:31] that we need we have to go venture out
[25:32] for no anything else no no therapists no
[25:35] counselors none of that stuff you have a
[25:38] mighty counsel right here I'm not I'm
[25:40] not saying you can't go to a counsel I'm
[25:41] not saying that but a lot of times we we
[25:43] like to lean on a crutch on a counsel or
[25:45] crutch on something else in our life but
[25:46] lean upon God lean on his Everlasting
[25:49] Arms he's not going to change not one
[25:52] time he can't fail you he won't fail you
[25:55] he's never lost a battle amen
[25:59] amen amen so I remember I was listening
[26:02] to this message today the seven compound
[26:04] names Jehovah and brother Brandon was um
[26:06] with his wife and his son Billy I
[26:08] believe and uh he went hunting on his
[26:10] trip and it was storming and uh he
[26:12] thought himself he's a good Woodsman and
[26:13] everything and he thought you know he's
[26:15] pretty he's kind of thinking kind of
[26:16] highly of himself and then sometimes God
[26:18] will put us in situations where it makes
[26:20] us really realize that we're not as good
[26:22] as we think we are and it kind of
[26:24] humbled brother Brandon cuz he was lost
[26:26] he was worried about his kids you know
[26:27] like his wife and kid being alone and
[26:29] and suffering and so so God was was
[26:32] whispering this thing into his ear I'll
[26:34] read it so I kept hearing something
[26:35] whispering in my ear the Lord is our
[26:38] refuge and strength a very present help
[26:41] in the time of trouble now I'm getting
[26:42] franked frantic I started walking on
[26:45] something said the Lord is our refuge
[26:47] and a help a very present help in the
[26:49] time of trouble I just kept on walking
[26:50] it got louder the Lord is our refuge and
[26:53] strength a very present help in the time
[26:55] of trouble I kept moving and dragging my
[26:57] gun along I was so tired then you know
[27:00] the Lord is our refuge and strength that
[27:03] was Jehovah shemma talking to me think
[27:05] about that the Lord is reminding you who
[27:08] he is in the situation see sometimes we
[27:10] forget who God is in our our situation
[27:12] we get so so bound so bogged so stressed
[27:15] uh our boss is just this just riding on
[27:18] us and everything our wife's yelling us
[27:19] our husband's yelling whatever it is the
[27:21] kids acting crazy and we forget who God
[27:24] is in that situation and each Redemptive
[27:26] name is for a certain situation
[27:29] because you always don't need healing in
[27:30] every situation but you need peace in
[27:32] some
[27:33] situations so we got to recognize that
[27:35] God isn't just this one thing God's Not
[27:37] In The Box I'll tell you that God is
[27:39] omnipresent he's everywhere you got to
[27:41] believe that he's everywhere in every
[27:43] part of your life you got to believe
[27:44] that amen amen so now let's go to I want
[27:47] to talk about some of the Redemptive
[27:48] names now so amen so we'll go first
[27:52] Jehovah Gyra so that was first mentioned
[27:55] uh when Abraham was to sacrifice Isaac
[27:57] so Jehovah Gyra the Lord will provide so
[28:01] he'll provide bills he'll provide
[28:04] restoration the most thing he the most
[28:06] thing the Lord wants to provide in your
[28:08] life is restoration of your soul that's
[28:11] the most important thing cuz you can get
[28:13] brand new cars your bills can be paid
[28:15] but the most important thing God is
[28:16] looking for is your soul to be restored
[28:19] he wants to reconcile you so you can go
[28:21] reconcile somebody else see God wants to
[28:23] see that restoration inside of you so he
[28:25] can use you to show somebody how
[28:27] important rest restoration is just like
[28:29] the wel Revival they said where's the
[28:30] wel Revival I'm the wel
[28:33] Revival they got to look at it like that
[28:35] CU God wants to use you in a certain way
[28:37] but if you're not restored in the proper
[28:39] way how can he use you to your full
[28:41] potential right and then we got Jehovah
[28:44] Rafi the Lord that Health all thy
[28:47] diseases it doesn't matter what what
[28:50] demon they call it or what name they
[28:51] call it the Lord can heal that disease
[28:53] he can use doctors to help aid it or he
[28:55] can heal you just like that whatever the
[28:57] Lord but you got to believe that your
[28:59] healing lies in God your healing doesn't
[29:01] lie in what the doctor can do but your
[29:02] healing lies in what God can do cuz he
[29:04] promised to heal you so I I put a
[29:07] scripture with that too and he said if
[29:09] thou will diligently hearken to the
[29:11] voice of the Lord thy God and will do
[29:13] that which is right in his sight and
[29:15] will give ear to his Commandments and
[29:17] keep all his statutes I will put none of
[29:19] these diseases upon thee which I have
[29:20] brought upon the Egyptians for I am the
[29:23] Lord that Health thee that's right even
[29:26] said he sent your word and he heal your
[29:29] disease and then we got another
[29:30] Redemptive name Jehovah Shalom I think
[29:34] in a day and age where Satan is running
[29:36] so rampant he's trying to get our eyes
[29:38] off of Peace he doesn't want you to have
[29:40] peace he wants you to have headaches he
[29:42] wants you to have worry he wants you to
[29:43] have arguments he wants if you look at
[29:45] what Satan is trying to do he's trying
[29:47] to take uh the the the perfect image of
[29:50] a family of a man and a wife and the
[29:53] proper like that Christ man and woman
[29:55] he's trying to reverse it and put woman
[29:57] and man he's trying to get the woman to
[29:59] be the provider of the house he's trying
[30:00] to get the woman to do everything that
[30:01] the man's trying to do but God didn't
[30:04] create a woman to do a man's job he
[30:06] created a woman to do everything a man
[30:08] can't do and a man do everything a woman
[30:10] can't do and that's how a family
[30:11] supposed to mesh together I'll say in
[30:13] the statement yesterday I believe that
[30:15] in a household I believe uh the backbone
[30:18] of a family is the prayers of a wife I
[30:21] believe it because the man go out there
[30:22] and he's doing all the things getting to
[30:24] certain spirits and all these things and
[30:26] she's staying home and praying for the f
[30:28] I believe it's that backbone I believe a
[30:30] wife a Godly wife is so important
[30:32] brother Bram said this statement he said
[30:33] that outside of Salvation is a wife I I
[30:37] believe that outside the greatest thing
[30:38] God can give you out of Salvation is a
[30:40] wife and I believe that a wife is helps
[30:42] you anchors you and if if a man is
[30:44] staying in the right position in his uh
[30:46] called position then the wife is going
[30:48] to fall right in line see we as in as
[30:52] men we got to fall in line with the word
[30:55] we can't go say well I'm the boss of the
[30:57] house I I got the authority no it
[30:58] doesn't work that way you got to fall in
[31:00] line cuz the Bible says it's not my
[31:02] notes but let's go to
[31:03] Ephesians it says I love this right here
[31:06] it says verse 21 Ephesians 5:21
[31:10] submitting yourselves one to another in
[31:11] the fear of God wives submitting
[31:13] yourself unto your own husbands as unto
[31:15] the Lord see sometimes the husbands will
[31:17] stop right there but it's a little bit
[31:19] more after that says for the husband is
[31:22] the head of the wife even as Christ is
[31:23] the head of the church and he is the
[31:25] savior of the body therefore the church
[31:27] is subject unto Christ so let the wives
[31:29] be to their own husbands and everything
[31:31] look what it says right here verse 25
[31:33] husbands love your wives even as Christ
[31:37] also loved the church and gave himself
[31:39] for it Christ doesn't go around and tell
[31:41] you how much Authority he has over you
[31:42] he doesn't so as as husbands of the
[31:45] household we got to lead by example I
[31:47] know I'm not a husband yet but one day I
[31:48] will be I believe it by faith amen so
[31:51] you got to love your wives even as
[31:53] Christ also loved you so in order to
[31:54] know that you got to fall deeper in love
[31:57] with Christ the love of Christ has to be
[31:59] radiating outside of you and so I think
[32:01] that's so important because the devil is
[32:03] is constantly trying to dismantle
[32:05] familyhood that's it and that's how he
[32:07] starts in the homes that's why you have
[32:09] all this social immorality people don't
[32:11] want to get married anymore divorces
[32:13] happen because they're marrying for the
[32:14] wrong things you don't marry somebody
[32:16] because they look good but you marry
[32:18] somebody what's inside of them and the
[32:20] the most important thing that has to be
[32:22] inside of him is himself seal with the
[32:23] Holy Ghost that's the most I don't care
[32:25] how good they look how good a person now
[32:28] they have the most important thing is
[32:30] what's inside because when when Beauty
[32:32] Fades what's left what do you got left
[32:36] amen amen let's keep going so now he
[32:39] said Jehovah Shalom our peace so think
[32:41] about that our peace he said I leave
[32:43] peace with you that passes all
[32:45] understanding he say if you keep your
[32:46] mind stay on him he'll keep you in
[32:48] perfect peace notice that word perfect
[32:51] peace not temporary peace but perfect
[32:53] peace so the the when it first mentioned
[32:56] uh then Gideon built an altar there unto
[32:58] the Lord and called it Jehovah Shalom
[33:00] and unto this day yet an ofer of the
[33:02] aites judges 6:24 so Jehovah our peace
[33:06] just think about that no matter what
[33:08] situation you're going in no matter
[33:10] what's going on you can lose your job
[33:12] you can still be in peace You Can Be You
[33:14] Can Be months behind your bills and
[33:17] still have that peace because to me
[33:20] peace isn't based upon
[33:21] circumstances just like just like Joy
[33:24] isn't based upon circumstances only
[33:25] thing is based upon circumstances is
[33:26] happiness but joy joy doesn't look at
[33:29] the circumstances peace doesn't look at
[33:30] the circumstances peace and joy look at
[33:33] God because it says the joy of the Lord
[33:35] is my strength so notice that my
[33:37] strength now we got Jehovah nii the Lord
[33:41] our Banner think about that and Moses
[33:43] built an altar and called the name of
[33:45] Jehovah nii unto this day yet in ofra
[33:48] that's Exodus 17:15 and we got Jehovah
[33:51] Ro the Lord my shepherd now I love this
[33:54] scripture right here the Lord is my
[33:55] shepherd I shall not want let's go to
[33:58] Psalms
[33:59] 23 see a lot of times we we're always
[34:02] wanting for something the wrong thing
[34:05] and we got to be careful what we're
[34:07] setting Our Eyes Upon Our Pastor brother
[34:08] Jack was talking about a couple weeks
[34:10] ago how you got to be careful in the
[34:11] things that you watch because they can
[34:14] make you want things that are outside of
[34:16] God's perfect will for himself time you
[34:18] got to be careful what you're watching
[34:19] because they can make you want things
[34:21] that are outside of perfect of God's
[34:23] perfect will so we got to be careful the
[34:25] things that we're feeding upon us a
[34:26] black dog and a white dog inside of all
[34:28] of us you can either feed the white dog
[34:30] or the black dog the white dog is your
[34:31] spiritual man the black dog is your
[34:33] carnal man now whatever you feed out the
[34:35] most is going to be what comes out on
[34:37] top now I'm not saying you can't watch
[34:39] TV I'm not saying you can't play games
[34:40] I'm not saying all that what I'm saying
[34:42] is watch what you're watching and watch
[34:45] what you're playing cuz they can bring
[34:46] Spirits into your home and and spirits
[34:48] come on you just like our Pastor said so
[34:51] verse 23:1 it says the Lord is my
[34:55] shepherd notice that personal again my I
[34:57] shall not want he maketh me to lie down
[35:00] in Green Pastures he leadth me beside
[35:03] look at that word Still
[35:05] Waters he restoreth my soul when I'm
[35:07] reading this I think of Peace that's the
[35:09] first thing comes of Mind Jehovah Shalom
[35:12] he restoreth my soul look at that
[35:14] restoration he restoreth my soul he
[35:16] leadth me in the path of righteousness
[35:18] for his name's sake yay though I walk
[35:21] through the valley of the shadow of
[35:22] death I love that description in that
[35:25] Valley there has to be light to be a
[35:27] Shadow so just because there's Darkness
[35:29] around you there's a light somewhere in
[35:31] there and that's God's light he's
[35:34] leading you because he knows there's
[35:36] going to be tough times where the he's
[35:38] the enem is going to run rampant in your
[35:40] life but don't let trials surprise you
[35:43] they're there for your benefit they're
[35:45] there to help you get to more
[35:47] restoration that's what trials are for
[35:49] they're here to help you grow it says yo
[35:52] yay though I walk through the valley of
[35:54] the shadow of death I will fear no evil
[35:57] for thou art with me thy rod and thy
[36:01] staff they comfort me thou preparest a
[36:03] table before me in the presence of my
[36:06] enemies thou anointest my head with oil
[36:08] my cup runneth over surely goodness and
[36:12] mercy shall follow me all the days of my
[36:14] life I will dwell in the house of the
[36:15] Lord forever I remember this scripture
[36:17] so vividly because when I was me and my
[36:20] brother were growing up we uh my our mom
[36:23] used to read the scripture every night
[36:24] to us and all it means something special
[36:26] me always she used always get like the
[36:27] cup and I used to love it so it just it
[36:29] means a lot to me just reading the
[36:31] scripture and now as I got older it
[36:32] means even more to me because it's been
[36:34] revealed to me personally so now I've
[36:37] experienced these things in my life and
[36:38] it means that much more than it did when
[36:40] I was a kid that's how the word of God
[36:42] should be that's how our walk should be
[36:44] uh the longer we serve God he should
[36:45] mean that much more to us it's like in a
[36:47] marriage your highlight of your marriage
[36:49] shouldn't be when you first get married
[36:51] it should keep growing it should keep
[36:53] building it should be even better than
[36:54] when it was when it first started just
[36:56] like your walk with Christ if you're
[36:57] really putting in the work the diligence
[36:59] the desperation it should build just
[37:01] like in a marriage you should be putting
[37:03] the work in I know it gets hard
[37:04] sometimes I know we get comfortable and
[37:06] lazy but it's no time to get comfortable
[37:08] and lazy our our kids needs us they need
[37:11] to see a perfect example so they can cuz
[37:13] your kids are going to do what you do
[37:16] whe whether you like it or not and then
[37:17] you ask why why you acting like this I'm
[37:20] acting like you I'm acting like I
[37:24] see I I can testify that I I didn't
[37:26] realize that thing things that were in
[37:28] my life that I got from watching what my
[37:30] parents did or watching the bad
[37:32] Tendencies they did and I didn't real
[37:34] realize that till I was put in certain
[37:36] situations where I was I got tested or I
[37:39] got in a situation where something
[37:40] happened or lashed out that I didn't
[37:41] expect to come out I'm like where' this
[37:43] come from and then I realized oh my
[37:45] goodness it came from what I saw my
[37:47] parents just like with finances bad with
[37:49] finances because that's what I saw
[37:52] growing up and I never got out of the
[37:54] habit and there something I have to
[37:55] break and and so there's certain things
[37:57] that want to make sure we want to iron
[37:58] out because they're not just going to go
[38:00] away magically just like with Moses
[38:02] instead of speaking to the Rock he hit
[38:04] the rock so he never gave God his anger
[38:06] just like with Samson he never gave God
[38:07] his heart all the way so certain things
[38:09] that we got to we got to deal with
[38:11] before they get out of hand just like
[38:12] with David David never uh dealt with his
[38:15] woman problem I say anybody has that
[38:16] problem but he never dealt with that
[38:17] issue in his life and he was still
[38:19] getting Revelation he was still walking
[38:21] close with God but a certain situation
[38:24] happened where that under the rug
[38:27] situation it came out of the rug and he
[38:29] had to pay for it he had to really pay
[38:32] for it and certain things that we're
[38:33] going to have to pay for if we don't get
[38:35] things handled out right now cuz God is
[38:37] giving us a time for restoration right
[38:39] now he's trying to restore all aspects
[38:41] of our life not just one but all aspects
[38:44] of our life and we got to get back in
[38:46] step with the word of God Amen we got we
[38:51] got uh we got one more so we got Jehovah
[38:54] I don't know how to say this word t
[38:58] thank you thank you thank you the Lord
[39:00] my righteousness so think about that in
[39:02] in his days Judah shall be saved and
[39:05] Israel swad safely and this is his name
[39:07] whereby he shall be called the Lord our
[39:09] righteousness so I always think about
[39:11] this scripture in um in Hebrews it talks
[39:14] about how he's a high priest that can be
[39:15] touched by the feeling your infirmities
[39:17] he said we can come boldly into the
[39:19] throne but it's not your righteousness
[39:22] it's his righteousness it's his merits
[39:24] that let you enter into the holiest of
[39:26] the holiest place
[39:28] and the thing is we got to recognize
[39:29] it's nothing that you and I can do or
[39:30] you and I can or did it's what he did
[39:33] that allows us to have this personal
[39:35] walk that allows us to have this Beau
[39:36] this this this building we have right
[39:38] now cuz some some churches are are are
[39:40] just hungering for a place just to
[39:42] worship we got a beautiful place right
[39:44] now I know it's not the perfect setup
[39:47] but it will be the perfect setup when we
[39:48] get our new building amen so until now
[39:50] we got to show God how faithful we are
[39:52] cuz it doesn't matter where you're
[39:54] having church at because we're the
[39:56] church
[39:58] Hallelujah we we can have church outside
[40:00] in in in uh in the courtyard and God
[40:01] still be there see God isn't Bound by
[40:04] some
[40:05] building God is only thing time God can
[40:08] be bound if if our faith isn't there so
[40:11] we got to if we believe he's here we got
[40:13] to bring them here too cuz it's a liquor
[40:16] fire and all all side of you got
[40:17] everybody has liquor fire but we got to
[40:19] don't leave God out there bring him with
[40:22] you amen amen now I believe we're living
[40:26] in the in the in the last days we're
[40:28] living in the days that we're otherwise
[40:30] the days that we're living in should
[40:32] cause the church to go completely into
[40:36] desperation I believe since the message
[40:38] this morning from God not me I believe
[40:41] it ought to throw this entire
[40:43] congregation into desperation that we
[40:45] have played long enough we went to
[40:47] church long enough we've got to do
[40:49] something and I read this uh this other
[40:52] quote I read this I was reading this
[40:53] quote the other day and it just really
[40:55] challenged me I believe that the reason
[40:57] we don't have desperation is because
[41:00] it's a lack of
[41:02] love God the love of God I'm read that
[41:05] one more time cuz it cut me a little bit
[41:07] I believe that the reason we don't have
[41:09] desperation is because it's the lack of
[41:11] love God the love of God I I think that
[41:14] the love of God causes desperation if
[41:17] God is in you the token inside of you
[41:19] and you see the conditions of the time
[41:21] and people waiting in sin the way they
[41:23] are it'll throw you into desperation I
[41:26] believe in will so I think we've the
[41:30] devil has gotten so cunning and so
[41:32] crafty like I always said this before he
[41:33] we got all this technology and it's a
[41:36] blessing but it's also a cursing because
[41:38] it can lead you so far away from God you
[41:41] got YouTube social media you name it you
[41:42] got these reals that reel you in just
[41:44] scrolling videos and just laughing ha
[41:47] and you you try to do something you try
[41:49] to look for this video and then other
[41:50] videos pop up and before you know it
[41:52] you're too far in and so it's caused us
[41:55] to lose our desperation because 40 50
[41:58] years ago Christians were desperate to
[42:00] see God move and I think we get so
[42:02] comfortable oh the the Lord's coming is
[42:04] going to come someday but brother Bram
[42:06] said this he said still plant your
[42:07] potatoes but live like God's coming
[42:10] tomorrow cuz we living like God's coming
[42:12] 20 years from now it could be it could
[42:14] be right now it could be 10 minutes from
[42:16] now so we got to live like he's coming I
[42:18] remember the statement I said one time
[42:19] pray like it's your last prayer imagine
[42:22] the desperation you'll have we just pray
[42:24] like oh I I got to get in today like
[42:27] like a meal I got to get this fast food
[42:28] real quick let me stuff my face real
[42:30] quick and we that's how we treat God
[42:32] don't treat we can't treat God like that
[42:33] anymore we got to be desperate because
[42:35] God's going to move if you're desperate
[42:37] if you really sincerely desperate God
[42:39] will move in the situation you need him
[42:40] to move in just like with Hannah she she
[42:43] hit the right vein she got desperate and
[42:45] say God I'm going to dedicate this child
[42:47] to you and God was like okay I hear you
[42:50] now and the same thing with that's like
[42:51] you may say you want res restoration but
[42:54] do you really want it your prayers are
[42:56] going to indicate if you really want it
[42:59] you're read you're reading the Bible
[43:01] life message of Y life is going to
[43:02] indicate how bad you want Restoration in
[43:04] your life CU restoration isn't going to
[43:06] come just because brother Jack because
[43:08] brother Jack's preaching what the Lord
[43:09] said to you but you got to be able to
[43:11] receive what is being spoken through
[43:13] brother Jack because he can't do it for
[43:16] you he can't he he would love to but he
[43:17] can't I can't do it no Minister here can
[43:19] do it you all responsible we have is is
[43:22] getting the word across as God's put in
[43:24] our hearts is to give it to you and we
[43:26] got to become not only hearers of the
[43:28] word but we got to do what is being
[43:29] spoken across the pulpit the prophet
[43:31] said this that I rather somebody live me
[43:33] a sermon than preach me a sermon so we
[43:36] got to live the message of the hour not
[43:38] just know about it yeah you can quote
[43:39] stuff but are you living the
[43:41] quotes that's that's the biggest thing
[43:43] like you said living Epistles that
[43:44] that's what God is looking for is living
[43:46] Epistles let's go to Romans chapter
[43:50] 8 we'll close after this on one more
[43:53] quote so this scripture just reminded me
[43:56] of um
[43:58] uh Psalms
[43:59] 46 so it says who shall separate us from
[44:03] the love of Christ so my Bible's telling
[44:06] me that nothing should separate us from
[44:07] Love Of Christ but we let things
[44:10] separate us from Love Of Christ we let
[44:13] life getting away we let our jobs
[44:15] getting away our our business getting
[44:17] away our our our family issues getting
[44:19] away we make all these excuses but never
[44:22] have a solution to the excuses because
[44:25] our excuses sound so good to us we've
[44:27] deceived our own self say it again our
[44:29] excuses sound so good to us it deceives
[44:31] our own self and we got to lay aside
[44:34] excuses because excuses will not get you
[44:37] anywhere with God CU God doesn't want to
[44:39] hear him and I don't want hear my God
[44:40] doesn't want hear my excuses either so
[44:42] it says who shall separate us from Love
[44:43] Of Christ shall tribulation distress
[44:47] persecution famine nakedness or Peril or
[44:50] sword as it is written for thy sake we
[44:53] are killed all the day long we are
[44:56] counted as sheep for the slaughter nay
[44:58] in all these things we are more than
[45:01] conquerors through him that loved us for
[45:04] I'm persuaded that neither death nor
[45:06] life nor angels nor principalities nor
[45:10] powers nor things present nor things to
[45:12] come nor height nor depth nor any other
[45:14] creature shall be able to separate us
[45:16] from the love of God which is in Christ
[45:18] Jesus our lord so now the Bible just
[45:21] gave us all the excuses we could have
[45:23] and it's telling us that none of these
[45:24] excuses should separate us from the love
[45:26] of God
[45:27] so right there is telling us our excuses
[45:29] are nothing they're
[45:30] worthless we we might as well just cast
[45:32] them right then and right out and I'm
[45:34] guilty of making excuses sometimes I'm
[45:35] not going to say I put myself right in
[45:37] the CHP like I am guilty but the thing
[45:39] is we got to this should be the year
[45:41] where we we stop making excuses cuz all
[45:43] it's going to do is just prolong what
[45:44] God's trying to do in your life you can
[45:46] either go the easy way or the hard way
[45:48] you pick it Go God's perfect will
[45:50] permissive way you pick it you make that
[45:52] choice right now we'll close on this
[45:54] quote just think of that that everything
[45:56] in the old Testament pointed straight to
[45:58] Calvary all the plans of redemptions all
[46:01] the names all the symbols all the
[46:03] worship all the Tabernacles all of the
[46:05] wood all everything in this Tabernacle
[46:08] everything spoke of Christ wherever you
[46:10] go whatever you do God was back there in
[46:12] those old Hebrew prophets and so forth
[46:14] speaking and speaking to that time of
[46:17] perfection that Jesus would come to the
[46:19] perfect believer just of what think it
[46:21] means friends so we said before just
[46:23] don't forget Jehovah is present right
[46:26] right now whatever situation you're
[46:28] going in he's present right now waiting
[46:31] for you to access him brother Bram said
[46:34] this statement everything you have need
[46:35] of is inside of you just waiting to be
[46:37] gerti by the Holy Ghost everything you
[46:40] have need of not everything you want but
[46:42] everything you have need of and and God
[46:44] will bless you exceedingly and
[46:46] abundantly I always will say the
[46:47] scripture the day I die Matthew 6:33 but
[46:49] seek ye first the kingdom of God and his
[46:52] righteousness and all these things will
[46:54] be added unto you so God knows what you
[46:57] need he he knows what you need from the
[46:58] beginning of your journey to the end of
[46:59] your journey he said I have plans to
[47:01] prosper you and give you an expected end
[47:04] he promised to give you an expected in
[47:05] and it says you got to seek him with all
[47:07] your heart though that that that's the
[47:08] Catch 22 right there God doesn't ask for
[47:11] much all he ask for is is you that's all
[47:14] he wants is you all of you not just the
[47:16] portion you want to give him but every
[47:19] single last piece of you your heart your
[47:21] mind your body and soul and I promise if
[47:23] you really do that if you really really
[47:25] do that God is going to do things that
[47:27] you never seen him do before in your
[47:28] life because you are letting him have
[47:30] full premeny in life let's bow our
[47:33] heads dear heavenly father we are so
[47:36] thankful Lord for this day Lord thank
[47:38] you just for reminding us Lord that this
[47:40] the seven compound names that you are
[47:42] Lord you are still those names every
[47:45] name that that you named Lord that we
[47:47] named lies in you Lord Jesus and father
[47:50] we're so sorry for forgetting those
[47:53] things sometimes you just have to bring
[47:54] things to our remembrance I'm so
[47:56] thankful Lord that you bring those
[47:57] things to our remembrance or to remind
[47:59] us who you really are ohmighty God we're
[48:02] so thankful Lord that you're calling us

[48:20] in this season all these things Lord
[48:22] that you're trying to restore
[48:23] Deliverance in this season Lord father
[48:25] we want to miss it Lord we want to be
[48:27] right front and center Lord we want to
[48:28] be aware spiritually to hear and to see
[48:31] what you're trying to lead us into Lord
[48:33] Lord just give us eyes to see a heart to
[48:35] receive and and and faith is to walk in
[48:38] as you speak Lord and almighty God uh as
[48:41] we uh would leave soon Lord we pray that
[48:43] your presence doesn't leave us but it
[48:45] goes with us Lord may you continue to
[48:47] lead us and guide us Lord as we need
[48:49] your help Lord you said in your word
[48:51] that you're a present help in a present
[48:53] time and Lord we we need your help we
[48:55] want to wait until uh everything's
[48:57] falling apart and then the ship's
[48:59] falling apart but Lord we want to just
[49:01] call on you right now even in the good
[49:03] times and the bad times Lord because our
[49:05] tendency Lord as human beings is to wait
[49:08] until we we need help but Lord we don't
[49:10] want to wait till we need help but Lord
[49:12] we want to call upon you day and night
[49:14] Lord I want to cry out to you Lord just
[49:17] as your word says I remember David was
[49:19] just talking about how that he needed
[49:21] you like like water like in a dry and
[49:23] thirsty land oh God may we be desperate
[49:26] from this day day forth Lord may we no
[49:28] longer just be lazy and slothful but

[49:32] fixated on you the author and finish of
[49:34] our faith almighty God may you have your
[49:36] way tonight Lord let us just meditate
[49:38] upon this word Lord let us just just
[49:40] think about this word throughout the
[49:42] coming days Lord and help help this word
[49:44] just to be just written Upon Our Hearts
[49:45] and our minds Lord we give you all the
[49:47] praise all the honor in Jesus Christ's
[49:49] name we pray amen
[49:53] [Applause]
[50:02] amen praise the Lord amen amen
[50:05] appreciate that brother Mark
[50:07] amen so many uh we call them golden
[50:12] nuggets amen and and in that and he was
[50:15] talking about that one quote where he we
[50:17] talking is uh in God hidden in himself
[50:20] in Simplicity say the beauty of the
[50:24] church is in the character of the people
[50:28] the beauty of the churches and the
[50:30] character of the people and I just
[50:31] believe that amen God has a place amen
[50:34] that he that he's getting ready for us
[50:36] to move right into but it won't be no
[50:39] good if if the character of the people
[50:40] ain't no good amen cuz uh that's that's
[50:44] the building is just uh breaking mortar
[50:47] amen because uh I believe honestly that
[50:51] that when when people come through the
[50:52] door they must feel the love of
[50:55] Christ amen must feel the love of Christ
[50:58] in in in that Sanctuary amen so we
[51:01] probably have some things we need to
[51:03] just clean up amen little things that uh
[51:06] we got in our hearts against one another
[51:08] and things like that because how can you
[51:10] uh say you love God and and that who you
[51:13] never seen before amen and and and don't
[51:15] love your fellow man who you fellowship
[51:17] with every week amen make things right
[51:20] with one another love one another amen
[51:23] these things are very important because
[51:24] see the devil will come in and just put
[51:26] little things in your heart put little
[51:28] things against this right there and
[51:30] against this one it ain't nothing but
[51:31] the devil it ain't nothing and and when
[51:34] somebody draw a circle and draw you out
[51:36] you just draw a bigger Circle and draw
[51:38] them back in
[51:39] amen amen that's what's going to keep
[51:42] the church
[51:43] strong amen that's right amen so we love
[51:47] that brother brother brother uh Mark I
[51:49] appreciate that he was talking about
[51:51] that City of
[51:52] Refuge amen that that place that we can
[51:55] see sometime uh uh things come out of
[51:57] left field I don't know how many's ever
[52:00] been hit without seeing it
[52:03] coming yes see some look when when it's
[52:07] easy sometime when you get hit and you
[52:09] got time to brace for it you see it
[52:12] coming so you can clinch up and Brace
[52:14] and and you ready for it and you can
[52:16] absorb that blow but when you don't even
[52:18] see it coming out of left field you just
[52:21] walking and minding your own business
[52:23] and P now you're disoriented you got to
[52:26] get yourself you don't even know who hit
[52:29] you but see we got to get ready and stay
[52:33] ready amen because see the devil will
[52:35] come out of left field sometime amen and

[52:41] a sudden we resort back to our old ways

[52:50] word of God get ready Stay Ready that's
[52:55] a message get ready Stay Ready amen so
[52:59] it's important for us to just be ready
