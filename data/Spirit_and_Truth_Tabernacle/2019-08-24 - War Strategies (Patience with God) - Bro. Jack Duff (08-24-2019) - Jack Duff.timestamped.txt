[1:05:49] scriptures here 2nd Peter chapter 1 and
[1:05:55] verse 3 we have we're still in our
[1:06:03] journey here of war strategies and I
[1:06:07] believe the Lord blesses last last week
[1:06:09] I want to thank God for brother Troy a

[1:06:39] trip coming back home and I kind of fell
[1:06:42] just not not necessarily ill but just
[1:06:45] wasn't feeling my best and two things
[1:06:48] came across my head like you know you we
[1:06:49] got help so let's use to help right and
[1:06:52] the second thing that came across my my
[1:06:55] mind is that I was very appreciative her
[1:06:57] brother Troy being very faithful to
[1:06:59] coming on Wednesday nights and Sharon
[1:07:02] start because we in tonight it's always
[1:07:04] a smaller crowd right and I say well you
[1:07:07] know if you faithful like that to come

[1:07:10] well let him come on a Sunday morning as
[1:07:12] well a man and share with the Saints and
[1:07:16] I was just so grateful for a man just
[1:07:18] coming on last week we appreciate
[1:07:20] that and as you all heard we got a
[1:07:23] tremendous amount of people that are
[1:07:25] going to Indiana so we just don't have
[1:07:28] that many brothers that are actually
[1:07:30] going to be left behind so we had to not
[1:07:34] have service here but that don't mean
[1:07:37] stay home right we want to encourage you
[1:07:41] that's a perfect time to go visit a man
[1:07:44] maybe show up at by the West coach or
[1:07:46] brother smiley Church brother gene
[1:07:48] church you know or if you have somebody
[1:07:51] been pulling on you like hey I want you
[1:07:52] to come visit my truck you come visit me
[1:07:54] I'll come visit you now you know they
[1:07:55] tell you that they be lying because they
[1:07:57] don't never come here right but but you
[1:08:01] can try it you know if you want to you
[1:08:03] can try it but that would be a perfect
[1:08:04] time to take them up on that off you
[1:08:07] know why we waste so but but I want to
[1:08:10] encourage everyone try to go somewhere a
[1:08:12] man and worship the Lord amen worship
[1:08:16] the Lord so keep that in mind let's uh
[1:08:18] let's look here 2nd Peter chapter 1 stop
[1:08:21] it starting at verse 3 and man
[1:08:28] all right
[1:08:38] let's praise the Lord we'll get through
[1:08:41] it
[1:08:42] hey man give me a second Peter chapter 1
[1:08:46] verse 3 says according as his divine
[1:08:49] power have given us all things that
[1:08:55] pertain unto life and godliness through
[1:08:57] the knowledge of him that have called us
[1:08:58] to glory and virtue we're ever given
[1:09:02] unto us exceeding great and precious
[1:09:04] promises that by these you might be
[1:09:06] partakers of the divine nature having
[1:09:09] escaped the corruption that is in the
[1:09:12] world through lust now please as we read
[1:09:13] this understand that what the scriptures
[1:09:16] that I'm presenting to you are this is
[1:09:21] God's objective for us as Christians to
[1:09:28] come to a man a perfect place in him
[1:09:31] right this is his objective and there
[1:09:35] are certain qualities or certain things
[1:09:37] that he's expecting of us and we're
[1:09:39] reading about this divine nature here so
[1:09:41] this is a perfect place for us to do a
[1:09:45] self-evaluation right as to where we are
[1:09:50] you know when we look in the mirror of
[1:09:52] the Word of God Lord how do I measure up
[1:09:55] right so let's let's let's let's look at
[1:09:58] this sort of reverse forces whereby are
[1:10:01] given unto us exceeding great and
[1:10:03] precious promises that by these you
[1:10:05] might be partakers of the divine nature
[1:10:07] having escaped the corruption that is in
[1:10:09] the world through lust and beside this
[1:10:11] giving all diligence add to your faith
[1:10:15] virtue and to virtue knowledge and to
[1:10:18] knowledge temperance and to temperance
[1:10:21] patience and to patience godliness and
[1:10:24] we talked about temperance the last time
[1:10:26] we preached on this brother branham
[1:10:27] temper is of the devil right and I love
[1:10:31] the way that kind of slipped right into
[1:10:34] brother Troy's thought he was talking
[1:10:36] about King he was like one of the first
[1:10:39] people we saw display a temper and that
[1:10:41] temper actually calls him to kill his
[1:10:45] brother amen so if we have a prop
[1:10:49] without a temper that's something we
[1:10:51] need deliverance from right because
[1:10:53] that's that's of the devil that's not of
[1:10:56] God a man all right so he says here into
[1:10:59] knowledge temperance and to temperance
[1:11:00] patience to patience Scotland's to
[1:11:02] countless brotherly kindness and to
[1:11:03] brotherly kindness charity if these
[1:11:05] things being you and abound they should
[1:11:08] make you that you should neither be
[1:11:09] barren nor unfruitful in the knowledge
[1:11:11] of our Lord Jesus Christ but he that
[1:11:13] lacketh these things is blind and cannot
[1:11:20] see afar off and hath forgotten that he
[1:11:22] was purged from his old sins wherefore
[1:11:24] the rather of brethren give diligence to
[1:11:26] make you a call the election show for if
[1:11:28] you do these things you shall never fall
[1:11:31] alright let's look at another passage
[1:11:35] over here in Joshua chapter 5 and I'll
[1:11:39] have a word of Prayer and I'll let you
[1:11:41] be seated
[1:11:41] Amen Joshua chapter 5 praise the Lord
[1:11:47] here verse 13 in Joshua chapter 5 ma'am
[1:11:52] it reads as follows says and it came to
[1:11:57] pass when Joshua was by Jericho that he
[1:12:02] lifted up his eyes and looked and behold
[1:12:04] there stood a man over against him with
[1:12:07] his sword drawn in his hand and Joshua
[1:12:09] went unto him and said unto Him art thou
[1:12:13] for us or for our adversaries and he
[1:12:18] said nay but as captain of the hosts of
[1:12:22] the Lord am I now come and Joshua fell
[1:12:27] on his face to the earth and did worship
[1:12:29] and set an EM what saith my lord unto
[1:12:32] his servant and I love this right
[1:12:35] because as as Joshua is in the presence
[1:12:40] of the Lord the captain of the Lord's
[1:12:43] hosts Joshua is actually receiving a war
[1:12:47] strategy a man right and the captain
[1:12:51] Alaura so sailing to Joshua loose tie
[1:12:53] shoe for both a foot for the place where
[1:12:56] thou standest is holy and Joshua did so
[1:12:59] a man you got to be able to read between
[1:13:01] the lines
[1:13:02] to see that Joshua's getting a war
[1:13:04] strategy amen at this moment let's pray
[1:13:07] Amen over the word father we thank you
[1:13:09] for the ability to read scripture and
[1:13:14] God we trust that you would now take
[1:13:18] what we have read and Lord just quicken
[1:13:22] it about hearts and oh god may we
[1:13:27] receive amen from the word of the Lord
[1:13:30] today may we leave encouraged and
[1:13:32] strengthened by your word and thought we
[1:13:35] just pray that you have your way and
[1:13:37] this portion of service would take every
[1:13:39] spirit that is against the Spirit of God
[1:13:41] underneath control of the Holy Spirit
[1:13:43] even right now in Jesus name we pray
[1:13:46] amen amen god bless you you can be
[1:13:49] seated
[1:13:59] praise the Lord so on today that we have
[1:14:03] this topic of war strategies patience
[1:14:07] but we have to preach this in two parts
[1:14:11] Amen this this particular strategy has
[1:14:14] to be preached in two parts and and I've
[1:14:17] been certainly just kind of trying to
[1:14:20] work through which way to go today
[1:14:22] because I feel like both of them are
[1:14:24] necessary both parts are necessary but
[1:14:26] brother branham brings to our attention
[1:14:28] when you're listening to the message
[1:14:32] statute of a perfect man when he starts
[1:14:34] talking about patience he says there's
[1:14:36] there's talks about two different kind
[1:14:38] of says we have to have patience with
[1:14:40] God and then we also have to have
[1:14:43] patience with one another
[1:14:44] a man so which I again I think both of
[1:14:47] those are very important for us and on
[1:14:51] today what I want to do is just dwell on
[1:14:53] the topic patience with God they men war
[1:14:57] strategies patience with God the Prophet
[1:15:00] gave us seven different examples in the
[1:15:06] sermon stature of a perfect man he gives
[1:15:08] us seven different seven different
[1:15:10] examples of patience of people that or
[1:15:14] group of people that displayed patience
[1:15:18] he talked about Abraham he talked about
[1:15:21] Noah we've talked about Moses he talked
[1:15:25] about the Hebrew boys he talked about
[1:15:27] Daniel he talked about Paul and and the
[1:15:30] one thing that I love about when they
[1:15:32] talked about Paul he only brought in one
[1:15:34] sentence about Paul one or two sentences
[1:15:37] but he said Paul had patience right so
[1:15:40] I'm like I said well that that's
[1:15:41] something and then he talked about the
[1:15:43] believers on the day of Pentecost how
[1:15:45] they also demonstrated patience by
[1:15:48] waiting on God waiting in the upper room
[1:15:52] until God did something a man I
[1:15:56] um I don't want it just to be a song a
[1:16:00] man I want it to be a reality in my life
[1:16:03] right there's a song that they sing I
[1:16:05] don't mind waiting I don't mind waiting
[1:16:08] on the Lord but but really really when
[1:16:11] the trial comes Amen I think sometimes
[1:16:14] we do mind waiting right we get ahead of
[1:16:19] guard we get in front of God we we want
[1:16:22] to beat caught to it we actually want to
[1:16:24] tell God how to do it come on somebody
[1:16:27] right but but but but we got to learn
[1:16:29] how to just wait on the Lord's a man the
[1:16:33] scriptures say wait on the Lord and be
[1:16:34] of good courage he will strengthen that
[1:16:37] heart and man did anyway don't to say it
[1:16:39] again wait I say on the Lord right so so
[1:16:44] we got to learn amen as believers to
[1:16:47] just wait you got to learn amen
[1:16:50] understand that sometimes amen it might
[1:16:54] not be your season just yet come on
[1:16:58] somebody you might see somebody else get
[1:17:00] blessed
[1:17:01] praise the Lord just because God bless
[1:17:04] so-and-so with a car don't mean you
[1:17:07] supposed to run out there get one hello
[1:17:09] somebody you got to learn to wait on the
[1:17:12] Lord now you do what you need to do is
[1:17:13] rejoice with them in a car and if you
[1:17:17] need a car god bless you at one but you
[1:17:22] got to wait on God don't don't don't get
[1:17:25] in our hurry and get in front of God
[1:17:26] don't don't pray and didn't expect the
[1:17:29] answer that happened just like that
[1:17:30] sometimes it does but not all the time
[1:17:34] hallelujah we got to learn to wait on
[1:17:37] the Lord Amen be patient with God the
[1:17:39] Prophet makes this statement amen in
[1:17:42] this message the Statue of a perfect man
[1:17:44] I'm at paragraph 233 says patients with
[1:17:48] what he says what kind of patients first
[1:17:52] thing is have patience with God if you
[1:17:55] got real genuine faith you'll have a
[1:17:59] real genuine patience because faith
[1:18:02] worketh patience hey man
[1:18:06] faith worketh patience that that
[1:18:10] she oughta be a good indicator to you it
[1:18:13] meant that to do have faith the devil
[1:18:15] will tell you oh you ain't got no faith
[1:18:17] you think I'm afraid but if you're
[1:18:18] waiting for God to actually Vindicator
[1:18:21] God to manifest himself in your
[1:18:23] situation it at your shows that you do
[1:18:26] have faith you got faith to wait on gods
[1:18:30] hallelujah that no matter what come your
[1:18:32] way I'm a just wait you know when God
[1:18:35] made the way and you also know what you
[1:18:38] made the way come on somebody
[1:18:40] ain't glory to God but when God open up
[1:18:44] door came no man shut it somebody an
[1:18:49] answer so if so me so stop so that they
[1:18:52] ought to be indicated to you that I got
[1:18:54] faith because I'm able to wait alright
[1:18:58] glory to God said says faith worketh
[1:19:01] patience when God says anything you
[1:19:04] believe it that's all glory to God you
[1:19:06] got patience say well I asked him last
[1:19:09] night to heal me and I'm just as sick
[1:19:13] this morning oh my what patience that
[1:19:16] that's that's not even patience right
[1:19:18] she said action last night and I'm just
[1:19:20] a sickness one no my what patience God
[1:19:22] told Abraham and 25 years later there
[1:19:27] wasn't even one sign huh those here this
[1:19:32] man got a promise and 25 years later
[1:19:35] there's not even one side of this
[1:19:37] promise coming forth and notice what the
[1:19:39] prophets saying he would still believe
[1:19:41] him
[1:19:41] he was patient with God uh-huh can we
[1:19:45] just pause that just for a moment just
[1:19:47] reach over to your closest neighbor and

[1:20:06] matter how long I gotta wait I'm still
[1:20:08] believing praise God seem like
[1:20:11] everything that turned against me but

[1:20:14] believing let be the name of Lord
[1:20:17] hallelujah the doctor trauma put me on
[1:20:21] low medicine but I still believe come on
[1:20:26] somebody I'm still expecting God to
[1:20:29] touch me I'm still expecting my healing
[1:20:33] come on somebody hallelujah Amen what no
[1:20:38] matter how long we have to wait you keep
[1:20:40] your faith and just be patient and wait
[1:20:43] on the Lord
[1:20:44] it says they say says put them always
[1:20:47] before you let him be the next crossing
[1:20:50] thing if you can't cross him so just
[1:20:53] keep him before you said so and it's
[1:20:55] going to happen that's it brother
[1:20:59] Geoffrey it's going to happen do you
[1:21:03] know that job you've been waiting on
[1:21:04] it's going to happen how that that house
[1:21:09] whatever is going to happen glory God
[1:21:15] somebody my family coming in is going to
[1:21:20] happen man i'ma just wait Oh God
[1:21:26] I'm gonna quit in the process that's not
[1:21:30] even an option I just I just do it
[1:21:33] always so I come in to worship and
[1:21:34] praise them in the midst of whatever I'm
[1:21:36] going through hallelujah it's going to
[1:21:39] happen see keeping it for you that's
[1:21:42] right so here you know the Prophet uses
[1:21:44] Abraham in this example and we know the
[1:21:47] scripture talks about how Abraham a man
[1:21:50] waited 25 years for the promise that God
[1:21:54] gave him to come to pass and here we are
[1:21:56] the seed of Abraham we have to have the
[1:21:59] same faith we have to have the same
[1:22:01] patience a man we have to have the same
[1:22:03] resolve the scripture tells us in in
[1:22:07] Luke 21 19 its impatience in in your
[1:22:12] patience possess your souls in your
[1:22:15] patience possession your souls and let's
[1:22:17] look at a statement here out of
[1:22:19] Philadelphia Church H the Prophet gives
[1:22:22] us something here that a man we want to
[1:22:24] just bring out says revelation 3:10
[1:22:27] because thou has kept the word of my
[1:22:31] patience I also will keep thee from the
[1:22:34] hour of temptation glory to God which
[1:22:38] shall come upon all the world to try
[1:22:40] them that dwell upon the earth it says
[1:22:43] what does he mean by the word of his
[1:22:46] patience Hebrews 6 verse 13 through 15
[1:22:49] but when God made promise to Abraham
[1:22:52] because he could swear by no greater he
[1:22:55] swear by himself saying surely blessing
[1:22:58] our Blessed II and multiplying our
[1:23:00] multiply V and so after he had patiently
[1:23:03] endured he obtained the promise you see
[1:23:07] the Spirit is speaking about the Word of
[1:23:10] God which is given to us to wait for the
[1:23:14] fulfillment of that word required
[1:23:19] patience hallelujah somebody to wait for
[1:23:23] the fulfillment of whatever God has
[1:23:26] promised you is gonna require patience
[1:23:29] even as it did in the case of Abraham he
[1:23:32] endure as seeing him who is invisible he
[1:23:36] was patient oh I loved that he was
[1:23:40] patient and then the word was well the
[1:23:44] word finally was fulfilled now the first
[1:23:47] thing has to happen is you have to
[1:23:48] demonstrate your patience to wait on the
[1:23:51] Lord oh my don't get in early with God
[1:23:55] don't do that amen
[1:23:57] you know one of the biggest problem that
[1:23:58] God had with us it's just being able to
[1:24:00] wait on him hallelujah glory to God and
[1:24:04] I mean think about the the Hebrew boys
[1:24:06] they had to get in the before God
[1:24:09] showed up right I mean not not right
[1:24:11] before the fire because we'll see the
[1:24:13] fire be light well Lord I can't do that
[1:24:15] God I can't go in there
[1:24:16] no Lord I can't I quit what are you
[1:24:19] talking about hey man you gonna miss
[1:24:21] your blessing if you don't get inside
[1:24:23] the fire now you're gonna miss a man
[1:24:28] seeing the fourth man they did not see
[1:24:31] him before the
[1:24:33] they saw him in the fire
[1:24:36] hallelujah church going to garden and
[1:24:39] I'm here to encourage you amen you might
[1:24:42] be going from one fiery trial to the
[1:24:45] next fiery trial but I'm hearing courser
[1:24:48] he is able to take you through the fire
[1:24:52] again it'll carry you through Church
[1:24:57] glory to God
[1:24:59] don't don't don't give up don't don't
[1:25:00] don't quit don't worry about it God got
[1:25:02] this thing under control
[1:25:04] see I'm stealing your Romans 8:28 bucket
[1:25:06] I'm still in there I'm telling you when
[1:25:10] you go back and really read that all
[1:25:11] things work together all things I mean
[1:25:15] no matter what it is all things it's
[1:25:19] working together for your good Amen it
[1:25:22] may not feel good I'm tired of my boss
[1:25:25] I'm tired of this no no no no no no no
[1:25:29] it's working together it's working
[1:25:33] together hallelujah but God wants you to
[1:25:37] be patient my god go fulfill his work
[1:25:39] but you got to be patient
[1:25:41] oh my god don't take it in your hands
[1:25:45] don't do that hallelujah when you do
[1:25:48] that then God got away bringing that
[1:25:50] thing right back around
[1:25:52] Loreena God you learn patience as you
[1:25:55] wait on the Lord amen glory to God he
[1:25:59] was patient and then the word finally
[1:26:00] was fulfilled this is the way God
[1:26:03] teaches his people patience look at it
[1:26:07] look at what he says why if he fulfilled
[1:26:10] his word in physical manifestations the
[1:26:14] very instant you prayed and and all of
[1:26:17] us want prayers like that I'll be honest
[1:26:19] with ya I just had one answered last
[1:26:21] night just like that I prayed and I
[1:26:24] needed a particular person that called
[1:26:26] me so the Lord I need them to reach out
[1:26:29] to me I ain't want to necessarily reach
[1:26:31] out to them but I need them to reach out
[1:26:33] to me and when I prayed I said Lord I
[1:26:35] just you know what I need and and within
[1:26:38] about about 40 minutes they got a text
[1:26:42] I say praise God praise God this is
[1:26:45] exactly what
[1:26:46] need it right and then that open up the
[1:26:48] door for me to share some things
[1:26:50] hallelujah but I couldn't go before God
[1:26:52] I had to wait now sometimes God will do
[1:26:55] that but not all the time
[1:26:56] there's some times that I needed God to
[1:26:58] Lord I need this done by this time can I
[1:27:04] tell them myself I need this done by
[1:27:07] this time and me I'm talking about me I
[1:27:11] give it away of God God if you don't do
[1:27:13] it by this time that's really what I'm
[1:27:16] saying in my prayer I got a plan B God
[1:27:26] told them that with my words but God
[1:27:28] knew my heart and he let me go right on
[1:27:31] with Plan B Plan B we'll put you more in
[1:27:36] depth somebody's saying man in here
[1:27:41] Plan B will delay the promise for being
[1:27:44] manifested Halloween to somebody plan B
[1:27:49] is a temporary satisfaction you need to
[1:27:55] stay and wait for plan a but I'm not
[1:27:58] gonna take Plan B hallelujah glory to
[1:28:04] God God is a good god hey man he know
[1:28:07] exactly what you need and when you need
[1:28:09] it you don't tell God you got no
[1:28:11] deadlines like he didn't see you get
[1:28:16] that notice God you see it God God know
[1:28:21] exactly but all about it amen
[1:28:23] you just learned to wait on God you
[1:28:25] present it and wait alright hello hello
[1:28:28] hello my God my God my God
[1:28:31] help us Lord Jesus amen this is the way
[1:28:35] God teaches his people patience
[1:28:37] why if he fulfilled this word and
[1:28:40] physical manifestations are very instant
[1:28:41] you pray you will never learn patience
[1:28:46] hallelujah but you become even more
[1:28:49] impatient with life that has all of life
[1:28:54] I mean you think about it you know your
[1:28:57] your your waiting on God
[1:28:59] learn how to be patient cause you to be
[1:29:01] patient with other people right hey man
[1:29:04] right so you become more even more
[1:29:07] impatient with life let me show you I
[1:29:09] don't know if I didn't bring that here
[1:29:12] it's gonna come back around and in the
[1:29:15] second part of the sermon let's just
[1:29:18] keep going since I let me show you this
[1:29:20] truth even more fully set forth Hebrews
[1:29:23] 11:17 by faith Abraham when he was tried
[1:29:25] off a deposit and he that had received
[1:29:29] the and he that had received the promise
[1:29:32] promises the Word of God offered up his
[1:29:34] only begotten Son there it is
[1:29:36] Abraham was tried after he received the
[1:29:42] word of promise so that this is key
[1:29:44] after you get a word from the Lord then
[1:29:47] you're gonna be tried on that word
[1:29:48] alright after you receive the word of
[1:29:50] promise
[1:29:51] most think that as soon as we pray in
[1:29:54] Jesus name glory to God over the good
[1:29:59] promises of God that there could not be
[1:30:01] a trial but here it says that Abraham
[1:30:05] was tried after he received the promise
[1:30:09] that is exactly correct according to the
[1:30:12] psalmist referring to Joseph and in
[1:30:16] Psalm 105 19 until that time that his
[1:30:20] word came the word of the Lord tried him
[1:30:23] look God gives us exceeding great and
[1:30:26] precious promises he has promised to
[1:30:29] fulfill them he will I believe that I
[1:30:32] believe that but from the time we pray
[1:30:36] until the time we get the answer we must
[1:30:40] learn to receive patients into our souls
[1:30:46] si si si si patience is working at a
[1:30:49] deeper level
[1:30:50] Amen it's not just your flesh being
[1:30:53] satisfied quickly but God what God wants
[1:30:56] to do something down at the soul level
[1:30:59] listen he says we receive we must learn
[1:31:02] to receive patience it's our souls for
[1:31:05] only in patience do we possess life
[1:31:10] may God help us to learn this lesson
[1:31:12] even as we know the people of the 6th
[1:31:14] age learned patience we read the history
[1:31:16] of the lives of these great Christians
[1:31:18] what a contrast we see between their
[1:31:21] lives and ours for they were so patient
[1:31:22] and quiet and today we are all but
[1:31:25] overcome and over in patience and haste
[1:31:29] we're overcome by over impatience and
[1:31:32] haste we want things to happen real fast
[1:31:34] you know I mean oh yeah yeah yeah I saw
[1:31:38] that happen for you but now I gotta get
[1:31:39] me one too and you get in debt like that
[1:31:41] right you're getting debt when you when
[1:31:44] you destroy when you when you trying to
[1:31:45] capitalize on somebody else blessing
[1:31:47] that ain't your blessing that's their
[1:31:49] blessing praise the Lord you got to wait
[1:31:52] for your blessing hallelujah and you'll
[1:31:55] know when God's done it you'll know when
[1:31:57] God if God in terms it's gonna be all
[1:32:00] kind of opposition all kind of opposite
[1:32:02] and then you just keep treading through
[1:32:04] just and you think you actually moving
[1:32:06] by faith you actually think you moving
[1:32:11] by faith but God just keep sending you
[1:32:13] warning after one that no no no no no
[1:32:15] just wait wait for me wait wait don't
[1:32:17] get ahead of me and that's in anything
[1:32:19] in life glory to God hallelujah glory to
[1:32:24] God all right
[1:32:25] he talked about Noah a man he made a
[1:32:30] statement here and see Noah preached for
[1:32:33] 120 years and this brother Branham said
[1:32:36] that's plenty of patience this man
[1:32:38] preaching for 120 years and not even do
[1:32:41] from heaven know do anywhere from heaven
[1:32:43] but yet he's still waiting on God he
[1:32:46] still believes that what God told him
[1:32:48] think about this I mean let this really
[1:32:51] sink in what the man is a hundred and
[1:32:54] twenty years later and he believed that
[1:32:57] what God told him 120 years ago it's
[1:33:02] still gonna be fulfilled
[1:33:03] now think about think about where we're
[1:33:05] at we got a man we got a promise that
[1:33:08] we've been waiting on for a hundred and
[1:33:10] twenty minutes by two hours we've been
[1:33:16] waiting on this thing to be fulfilled
[1:33:17] and we get ahead of God because if that
[1:33:20] thing won't happen
[1:33:21] I'm gonna give you a chance who we
[1:33:26] working with here right God God is not a
[1:33:29] minion a man that he should lie if he
[1:33:32] promised it it's gonna come to pass we
[1:33:34] don't we don't put stipulations on God
[1:33:37] God that's not operate by our time he is
[1:33:41] an eternal being Lord I'm gonna give you
[1:33:45] a chance now I'm gonna need you to do it
[1:33:46] like this and like that no you don't do
[1:33:49] God that way
[1:33:50] amen amen you just learn to wait them
[1:33:53] and however he decide to do it that's
[1:33:55] that's that's that's up that's his
[1:33:56] prerogative glory to God Church
[1:33:59] he said no wait 120 years Amen no no
[1:34:03] sign of rain from nowhere but yeah he
[1:34:06] would still believe said just as dusty
[1:34:08] as it ever was for a hundred and twenty
[1:34:11] years but he was patient now I want to
[1:34:13] read this statement here from the
[1:34:15] Prophet because I think this would be
[1:34:17] real real good this is out of paragraph
[1:34:18] 237 in the statute of a perfect man he
[1:34:21] says Noah had patience yeah Noah had
[1:34:25] real godly patience God said I'm going
[1:34:27] to destroy this world with rain and Nora
[1:34:30] preached 120 years yet
[1:34:32] plenty of patience not even do from
[1:34:34] heaven not even do fell from heaven
[1:34:36] wasn't nothing just as dusty as it ever
[1:34:40] was for 120 years but he was patient and
[1:34:43] I look at this then God tries your
[1:34:45] patience that's right
[1:34:47] God tries them I want you to think about
[1:34:50] that you can take it down I want to stop
[1:34:51] right there
[1:34:52] the brother branham say here here here
[1:34:54] no one's waiting 120 years and then he
[1:34:57] tries the spaces now not now now when I
[1:35:00] when I when I and I think about that
[1:35:02] just waiting 120 years is trial enough
[1:35:06] but that's that's trial enough but but
[1:35:10] when brother Branham makes this
[1:35:11] statement he's going a little deeper
[1:35:13] when he say God will try your patience
[1:35:16] Oh y'all gotta stay with me on this one
[1:35:19] now now it's one thing when Amen north's
[1:35:26] preaching and only people seem to agree
[1:35:29] with his message is his family and only
[1:35:32] people that he can get him
[1:35:33] votes at the preacher for 120 years the
[1:35:37] only amount of people you can get inside
[1:35:40] our bow is 8 and everybody that's in the
[1:35:44] bow is related to him
[1:35:46] now that's very discouraging that I can
[1:35:49] do all this preaching and not touch
[1:35:52] nobody's life a hundred and twenty years
[1:35:57] of preaching and nobody a man nobody's
[1:36:00] impacted by it but when he said that
[1:36:04] that that God will try your patience he
[1:36:07] was going a little deeper than that
[1:36:08] because when they finally got on the ark
[1:36:11] hallelujah brother Branham said that you
[1:36:14] got mad at Oh No
[1:36:16] go get everybody in the ark because I'm
[1:36:17] gonna sit in the rain tomorrow
[1:36:19] hallelujah and know about faith look go
[1:36:22] and get him right in the art and then no
[1:36:23] rain come on the next day oh Jesus
[1:36:26] and he say at that time maybe the first
[1:36:28] thing happened is his wife
[1:36:30] the closest thing to him begins to come
[1:36:34] next to him and this is how God begins
[1:36:37] to try his patience he lets his wife
[1:36:40] come and begin to doubt what he was
[1:36:42] saying no are you sure God told you this
[1:36:46] after hundred twenty years the boat is
[1:36:50] complete animals are coming and now God
[1:36:55] tries his patience by sending his wife
[1:36:59] to question everything he believed and
[1:37:03] God knows how to try you huh because the
[1:37:07] white fish the closest thing to you and
[1:37:09] you don't want to disappoint her
[1:37:11] right so God will try your patience by
[1:37:14] letting us say something and you gotta
[1:37:16] watch what you say back you gotta watch
[1:37:22] how you respond because God is trying
[1:37:25] your patience and all I can say is it's
[1:37:32] gonna rain here God told me a hundred
[1:37:36] and twenty years ago and I still believe
[1:37:38] it
[1:37:40] got a ring another trial to the patients
[1:37:46] I'm preaching all this right from a
[1:37:49] man's touch of a perfect man if you go
[1:37:51] back and listen to just that section
[1:37:53] you'll see I got this from there another
[1:37:56] tribes rapacious maybe though I say I
[1:37:57] can't get through to him and the kids go
[1:38:02] to mama
[1:38:02] and the kids say mama Hugh what you
[1:38:06] thought just daddy look daddy say it's
[1:38:09] gonna rain and here come the boys now
[1:38:11] the boys say daddy my mom have been
[1:38:15] acting this question you really gay no
[1:38:17] ask daddy we own this boat we got we got
[1:38:20] animals here we get debt and you said it
[1:38:23] was gonna rain yesterday
[1:38:24] it ain't rain yet it ain't rain yet
[1:38:27] daddy what daddy are you sure and he
[1:38:30] cried look at his boys say after 120
[1:38:33] years of preaching and you all get down
[1:38:36] to the wire the boat is complete the
[1:38:39] animals have come it's going to rain now
[1:38:44] that God you saw God close the door you
[1:38:48] saw these things and now you get this
[1:38:51] they in art doubt him
[1:39:02] in New York not outside that's not a
[1:39:06] trial with the ones that's outside we
[1:39:10] told I was happening on the inside these
[1:39:14] people are in the casting down god close
[1:39:21] the door even if I wanted to I could get
[1:39:25] out hey it's time to tell the devil that
[1:39:33] we're all to doubt that you bring even
[1:39:37] if I wanted to I could get out of this
[1:39:41] [Applause]
[1:39:46] tangled up in this promise they own the
[1:39:53] arc in the arc doubting that's heavy and
[1:40:02] that did this now this is this is this
[1:40:05] is North Church this is North family
[1:40:08] this is what noir produced after 120
[1:40:11] years of preaching this is what Noah got
[1:40:15] and he looks at and say oh my I mean all
[1:40:19] I can only words he has from God told me
[1:40:25] it's gonna rain and what you do is you
[1:40:29] find yourself as the only believer oh
[1:40:33] y'all in with me you find yourself
[1:40:36] standing alone you find yourself
[1:40:40] standing there by yourself you expected
[1:40:44] this one to be with you you expected
[1:40:46] that wouldn't be with you but no you
[1:40:47] standing alone and God want to know do
[1:40:51] you still believe you still gonna be
[1:40:56] patient
[1:40:57] you're still gonna wait you know the
[1:41:03] good thing about this is even you know
[1:41:05] like I say even if Noah try to leave he
[1:41:07] couldn't leave but you know the other
[1:41:08] good thing about that even if his family
[1:41:13] I don't care how much you doubt even if
[1:41:16] they try the leaf they could leave and
[1:41:20] eventually it settles him that we're in
[1:41:23] this together but what you got to do is
[1:41:27] let it settle in and don't argue it him
[1:41:30] don't force it in
[1:41:32] don't push it in eventually revelation I
[1:41:35] hate that we're in this thing together
[1:41:40] and then orchid that say son if you was
[1:41:42] going down you should have been on the
[1:41:44] other side of the door but not if you
[1:41:46] were to hear God gonna make a believer
[1:41:48] out of you God tries your patience
[1:41:56] that's right God tries them look at this
[1:42:03] oh my my I like this one here brother
[1:42:10] Adam said Moses had pieces Moses knew
[1:42:14] that he had to just wait on the Lord and
[1:42:16] and what happened with Moses is that he
[1:42:18] he got this you know this this startling
[1:42:23] Amen thing that happened to him on the
[1:42:26] backside of the desert and he's there
[1:42:28] and God has it he has a rod that's hand
[1:42:30] aghast a throw down on the rod and the
[1:42:33] rod turns into a snake now according to
[1:42:35] the scripture Moses began to run from
[1:42:38] that snake he was afraid of snakes so so
[1:42:41] as he's running from the snake then God
[1:42:44] challenges him hallelujah because so you
[1:42:48] can either be moved by fear or you can
[1:42:50] be moved by faith and what God has to do
[1:42:53] is actually challenge the faith caused
[1:42:55] that to rise up on the inside and he
[1:42:57] said not now I told you to throw down
[1:42:58] that snake I didn't tell you what was
[1:43:00] gonna happen I just told you to throw it
[1:43:01] down he threw it down by faith it turned
[1:43:03] into snake he run from he said now go
[1:43:05] back and pick up the snake
[1:43:08] now that's challenging your faith where
[1:43:11] you have to overcome your fear nobody is
[1:43:14] there with Moses no children no wife no
[1:43:19] other shepherds it's only Moses in a
[1:43:22] snake and I can imagine that snake would
[1:43:23] not move
[1:43:25] not move one going anywhere and Moses
[1:43:28] had to reach down by faith
[1:43:30] pick it up not knowing what was gonna
[1:43:32] happen and when they reaches down and
[1:43:34] picks us up mix it up it turns back to
[1:43:36] steam this just just just taken Moses to
[1:43:40] another level and there didn't say now
[1:43:43] most I want you to do something I know
[1:43:45] you know you don't you don't reach tell
[1:43:46] me a bosom for years now I want you to
[1:43:48] do it again reach down in your bosom and
[1:43:49] put your hand out
[1:43:50] he thought is just doing something like
[1:43:51] it like when it come out a white ass
[1:43:56] lepers he says oh my goodness now he's
[1:43:59] probably wondering in his mind what was
[1:44:01] in there if my hand went in there
[1:44:04] touched it what's in there that caused
[1:44:05] my hand to do saying I put your hand
[1:44:07] back in there wait a minute if it wasn't
[1:44:09] anything in there then imma cause the
[1:44:11] rest of my body to become contaminated
[1:44:14] by faith he takes his hand puts it right
[1:44:17] back down and brings her back out he's
[1:44:19] here hallelujah then Moses takes this
[1:44:23] down to Egypt he was that he was
[1:44:25] encouraged he was inspired and he goes
[1:44:27] down to Egypt and when it gets to Egypt
[1:44:30] he thought he had himself something
[1:44:32] Pharaoh let my people go and he's just
[1:44:36] sitting there discounting you know he
[1:44:37] got this confidence and it takes it and
[1:44:40] throws down his rod I told you Pharaoh
[1:44:43] let my people go it turns into a snake
[1:44:45] and Moses thought like everybody's gonna
[1:44:50] be like him running like he ran but that
[1:44:53] that would that won the case when he
[1:44:55] threw it down Pharaoh looked at Moses
[1:45:01] that's all you got say Moses you know
[1:45:04] that's a cheap magician trick now now
[1:45:06] now now now my question is what are
[1:45:08] these magicians practicing that Pharaoh
[1:45:11] would say that's a cheap magician trick
[1:45:16] hallelujah I love this look look at this
[1:45:18] statement
[1:45:20] I'm gonna just read the statement like I
[1:45:22] want to read the whole quote brother
[1:45:24] branham say when you've done exactly
[1:45:25] what he said do seem like it went wrong
[1:45:30] stand still and be patient I want to say
[1:45:34] that again when you're done exactly what
[1:45:37] he said - seemed like it went wrong
[1:45:44] stand still and be patient any all in
[1:45:47] some situations where it seemed like
[1:45:50] those are key words went wrong well I
[1:46:00] got an answer for this morning stand
[1:46:02] still be patient Jesus Moses stood there
[1:46:12] and when he see a cheap magician trick
[1:46:15] he just stood there patient waiting on
[1:46:16] God he didn't know what God God never
[1:46:18] even told him now Moses you gonna throw
[1:46:20] down your rod and they come through it
[1:46:21] on a rod and it's gonna become snakes
[1:46:23] and then I'm gonna take your snake and
[1:46:24] I'm eat he didn't tell Moses none of
[1:46:26] that Moses had to stand there by faith
[1:46:30] and wait for God to do what God was
[1:46:32] gonna do and before you know it
[1:46:34] Moses snake devoured the first one Moses
[1:46:38] snake devout the second one and then he
[1:46:41] reached down and picked up his his his
[1:46:43] his uh the rod again by the snake the
[1:46:47] snake's tail picked it up again now the
[1:46:49] question is now where are your snakes if
[1:46:50] you throw some mold down here we're
[1:46:54] gonna take them up - I'll come on
[1:46:56] somebody but that didn't happen until
[1:46:58] Moses demonstrated patience
[1:47:00] Moses then get up and get upset with God
[1:47:02] and run out in the room like Lord you
[1:47:04] you didn't tell me that was gonna happen
[1:47:05] he ain't got to tell you everything
[1:47:07] that's gonna happen he just wants you to
[1:47:09] be patient
[1:47:13] the Hebrew boys show patience by waiting
[1:47:16] on God to in the fire furnace Daniel
[1:47:18] show patience by waiting in the lion's
[1:47:21] den and and and and and it's just a real
[1:47:24] quick statement that the Prophet makes
[1:47:25] here in the statute of program and says
[1:47:28] Paul had patient said certainly did look
[1:47:32] what Paul had to do talk about patient
[1:47:34] let ask all the prophets said about Paul
[1:47:36] but never went into any detail you say
[1:47:39] Paul had patient glory to God certainly
[1:47:42] did look what Paul had to do talk about
[1:47:45] patient I might I say Lord well what did
[1:47:48] how did Paul have patience I went back
[1:47:51] to acts 23 11 let's read this real quick
[1:47:53] acts 23 11 hallelujah
[1:48:05] all glory it says and the night
[1:48:08] following the Lord stood by him and said
[1:48:14] be of good cheer Paul for as thou has
[1:48:17] testified of me in Jerusalem
[1:48:20] so much style bear witness also at Rome
[1:48:24] now Paul was going through some trials
[1:48:26] there in Jerusalem and you know I mean
[1:48:30] there were people that were threatening
[1:48:32] that they wouldn't kill Paul they were
[1:48:35] they were gonna do everything they could
[1:48:36] it just so happened that Paul had a
[1:48:37] nephew that kind of led him in on some
[1:48:40] of the secrets they were waiting on Paul
[1:48:41] to come through a certain certain path
[1:48:43] and they were gonna they were just going
[1:48:44] they were they gonna take Paul out my
[1:48:47] god but but somehow God you know
[1:48:50] responded and he and he brought Paul
[1:48:51] through that situation glory to God the
[1:48:54] same way that he'll bring you through
[1:48:55] whatever situation that the devil has
[1:48:57] planned against you and here he gives
[1:48:59] Paul a promise he says you know as you
[1:49:02] know Paul you as you testified of me and
[1:49:05] Jerusalem I also want you to bear
[1:49:08] witness of me in Rome and and I need you
[1:49:11] gonna testify of me and Rome now he's in
[1:49:14] Jerusalem but pretty much it's saying
[1:49:16] you're going to Rome you're gonna make
[1:49:18] it their own now now God is God God's
[1:49:24] ways are not our ways and God's thoughts
[1:49:27] are not our thoughts we think going to
[1:49:29] Rome maybe get in a plane and just go to
[1:49:31] Rome get in the boat at that time and
[1:49:33] just go to Rome God had other ideas of
[1:49:36] how he was gonna get Paul to Rome
[1:49:38] hallelujah amen and and I'm here to tell
[1:49:42] you don't matter how you get to Rome
[1:49:44] just long as you get to Rome Oh glory to
[1:49:47] God now as I start I just ran out of
[1:49:51] Acts 23 a man that Paul was on his way
[1:49:56] to Rome and it's a it's only in acts 28
[1:49:59] that we find Paul in Rome hallelujah so
[1:50:03] there's some things that happened from
[1:50:05] Acts 23 amen to acts 28 it meant only
[1:50:08] his way to Rome now now the first thing
[1:50:13] is in acts 24 he was taken to Felix who
[1:50:17] prolong
[1:50:18] judgment for two years Amen the man
[1:50:22] should have been released from prison
[1:50:23] but this man prolonged judgment until he
[1:50:26] was actually pushed out of office my god
[1:50:29] he was hoping that Paul would give him
[1:50:32] some money to buy his freedom Paul stay
[1:50:35] right in jail and didn't give a man
[1:50:37] nothing hallelujah
[1:50:40] the man ended up losing a man it's
[1:50:42] placing in the next governor comes in my
[1:50:45] god and we found him in acts 25 his name
[1:50:48] is Festus glory to God he replaced Felix
[1:50:52] and here Paul is appealing to stand
[1:50:55] before Caesar amen my God he's talking
[1:50:57] to Fester's but he said I appeal I want
[1:50:59] to go to Caesar
[1:51:00] where is Caesar sees us in Rome
[1:51:04] hallelujah but he's stuck over here amen
[1:51:07] for two years and now he's coming
[1:51:08] underneath to the next rule and he said
[1:51:10] I want to go to Caesar oh my God my God
[1:51:14] my God because he remembers the prophecy
[1:51:16] that he's the bear witness also in Rome
[1:51:19] why he's there underneath a Festus King
[1:51:23] Agrippa comes hallelujah and I love this
[1:51:25] part right here he stood before King
[1:51:27] Agrippa and he began to give his
[1:51:30] personal testimony King as he spent in
[1:51:33] that before King Agrippa now Paul is a
[1:51:35] man that wrote two thirds of the New
[1:51:37] Testament
[1:51:38] but when he will he stands before King
[1:51:41] get this when he stands before King
[1:51:44] rather than talk about all the deep
[1:51:46] revelations that God gave him Paul just
[1:51:49] begin to share his personal testimony
[1:51:53] and I want you to know by Paul's
[1:51:56] personal testimony King Agrippa says
[1:51:59] thou almost persuaded me to be a
[1:52:03] Christian not with his deep revelations
[1:52:07] not with his deep understanding but with
[1:52:11] his personal testimony he almost
[1:52:14] persuades King Agrippa to become a
[1:52:18] Christian I love that all you need is
[1:52:23] your personal testimony and so some
[1:52:26] people need to hear just how God did
[1:52:27] this for you how you getting away you at
[1:52:29] right now it's a personal testimony
[1:52:32] hallelujah be willing to share your
[1:52:34] personal testimony listen at this
[1:52:40] finally in acts 20:7 because he has
[1:52:44] asked to go to sit before Caesar acts
[1:52:48] for the seventh day finally loosed and
[1:52:50] they set sail for Rome but in the midst
[1:52:55] of selling to Rome the Bible says that
[1:52:59] they get caught by in tempestuous wind
[1:53:05] call euro-crime so this is what I get
[1:53:09] from this is that if acts 23 say you're
[1:53:13] going to Rome and in the midst of going
[1:53:16] the Rome I got to go through your Clyde
[1:53:18] on I am still in the will of God and I'm
[1:53:23] going to Rome I hope y'all get that the
[1:53:27] devil might be attacking you with the
[1:53:30] tempestuous wind and all the times when
[1:53:33] we have real serious trials we begin to
[1:53:36] doubt whether we're the will of God or
[1:53:39] not I'm here to tell the devil he's a
[1:53:41] liar
[1:53:42] even in your Oh Clyde time I am in the
[1:53:46] perfect will of God
[1:53:47] and I'm doing the role that see all
[1:53:52] things are working together for good I
[1:53:55] don't care about your old client you got
[1:53:58] another name for the storm because I'm
[1:54:00] gonna make it through your Clyde ah
[1:54:05] Jesus hallelujah glory to God Church not
[1:54:12] only not only is Paul gonna make it
[1:54:15] through the tempestuous wind but but in
[1:54:20] this trial God tells Paul that everybody
[1:54:24] that's with you gonna be spared but
[1:54:28] there's only one one thing they need to
[1:54:29] do stay on the boat and and Noah's day
[1:54:34] that had to get in the boat now and
[1:54:37] Paul's that you got to stay on the boat
[1:54:39] if you're gonna be spared hallelujah
[1:54:43] don't jump ship I just
[1:54:45] like telling y'all that don't jump sit
[1:54:47] well whatever you do don't jump ship
[1:54:49] don't don't don't jump sit God got this
[1:54:52] thing under control Holly in your
[1:54:55] marriage don't jump ship and your
[1:54:58] relationship don't jump ship on your job
[1:55:03] don't jump ship don't jump don't dopes I
[1:55:12] can't take no more this I mean you're a
[1:55:16] client I'm I'm being I'm being hit from
[1:55:18] all sides don't jump ship you're still
[1:55:21] in the will of God everybody that's
[1:55:26] selling with him gonna be spared they
[1:55:28] couldn't get out of the boat if they
[1:55:30] were gonna survive and then eventually
[1:55:33] the ship became stuck and the soldiers
[1:55:36] desire to kill some of the prisoners
[1:55:39] because they were thinking that they're
[1:55:40] gonna escape now now here's the thing
[1:55:43] when you read the scripture the the
[1:55:45] captain of the soldiers because Paul was
[1:55:49] on board the ship and he even though he
[1:55:51] was a captive a man because Paul was
[1:55:55] there that man say I'm not gonna kill a
[1:55:58] man the kill these prisons because
[1:56:01] powerless in the myths now I will tell
[1:56:04] you some there's some people being
[1:56:05] spared oh there there's some people
[1:56:10] being spared death because she would
[1:56:13] fall Oh hallelujah Church glory the
[1:56:20] reason that job is blessed and because
[1:56:23] she needs a blessing amen
[1:56:27] Paul was on board even though he was a
[1:56:29] prison sister citerior refused the
[1:56:31] request of the soldiers now look at this
[1:56:34] when when the ship was stuck the front
[1:56:39] end was stuck but the back end was in
[1:56:41] the water just being beat up against you
[1:56:43] know the water waves just beating it and
[1:56:44] just knocking boards and everything off
[1:56:46] now you got some people on the ship that
[1:56:49] I'm a prisoner but I don't know how to
[1:56:52] swim
[1:56:53] so you ain't got to worry about me
[1:56:55] running nowhere I'm goin wherever y'all
[1:56:59] going by this time they didn't cut all
[1:57:02] the boots all the safety wraps have been
[1:57:05] cut from the ship so so all they got now
[1:57:08] is a man is just some boards hallelujah
[1:57:11] and what when they were encouraged to
[1:57:13] say those that can swim go ahead and
[1:57:16] swim to shore but those that can't swim
[1:57:18] just grab ahold of one of the broken
[1:57:22] pieces and you just begin to float up to
[1:57:25] shore on broken pieces I'm here to tell
[1:57:29] you this morning you can make it broken
[1:57:34] pieces
[1:57:36] [Music]
[1:57:38] and even though you floated up down
[1:57:40] broken pieces you still in the will of
[1:57:42] God because you got to go to Rome
[1:57:46] hallelujah
[1:57:48] you can make it on broken pieces if if
[1:57:51] everything around you seem like it's
[1:57:53] falling apart you can still make it I'm
[1:57:56] broken pieces god help me Jesus
[1:58:00] oh you're still in the perfect will of
[1:58:04] God even when you were enduring euro
[1:58:08] Qaeda when you've done exactly what he
[1:58:16] said for you to do and it seemed like
[1:58:19] everything went wrong
[1:58:21] stand still be patient
[1:58:28] they get to shore
[1:58:31] they're not in Rome yet they just I'm
[1:58:34] sure they just made it up the show Paul
[1:58:36] it's cold Paul wants to stand by fire
[1:58:42] Paul
[1:58:44] reaches out in the fire to fix some wood
[1:58:47] and gets bit by a snake and when the
[1:58:52] people saw what kind of snake it was I
[1:58:53] say immediate death immediate and they
[1:58:58] just looked at him just with it
[1:58:59] no doctor could help him nothing this
[1:59:02] man gonna die right now everybody was
[1:59:04] expecting death but there was a promise
[1:59:12] Paul was wrapped in a promise all the
[1:59:16] way in acts 23 that say you gonna stand
[1:59:19] in Rome and you gonna be a witness so
[1:59:23] let me tell you something every trial
[1:59:27] that poll went through on his way to
[1:59:30] Rome became witness material I can stand
[1:59:37] to say I was bit by a snake but I'm
[1:59:39] still here I face euro climbing but I'm
[1:59:42] still here whatever the devil has tried
[1:59:46] has failed
[1:59:47] because I'm still loved this everything
[1:59:57] you tried everything you've tried you've
[2:00:03] done exactly what he said do seem like
[2:00:06] it went wrong you just stand still and
[2:00:09] be patient watch God do what he gonna do
[2:00:12] oh I just believe this I believe this a
[2:00:17] man a man

[2:00:46] get the mule out so they just begin to
[2:00:48] throw dirt in the whale
[2:00:51] and when they throw dirt in the whale
[2:00:53] they would hit the back of the mule and

[2:02:43] just want to share with you and we'll
[2:02:44] we'll slip over a man to this war
[2:02:47] strategy the the Prophet says this in a
[2:02:50] message the hours come
[2:02:53] it says recently she had sent one of
[2:02:57] those handkerchiefs to her sister for
[2:03:00] her little baby that had a clubfoot and
[2:03:02] she told a lady she said you tie the
[2:03:06] handkerchief on its foot and the Lord is
[2:03:09] going to heal it so she left the
[2:03:13] handkerchief on about two weeks and it
[2:03:15] got so dirty and she said you can wash
[2:03:18] it and then put it back on oh my god my
[2:03:23] god my god like dogs you can wash it and
[2:03:26] then put it back on so she did and the
[2:03:30] handkerchief
[2:03:31] getting kind of old and warm she said
[2:03:34] well there's no difference in the baby's
[2:03:35] foot that I guess I might as well take
[2:03:39] it off and she said oh don't you do that
[2:03:41] said if it comes to pieces you tie it
[2:03:46] with strings then tie it back on there
[2:03:50] she said because I know that it will get
[2:03:53] well she seems so many things done in
[2:03:55] the meetings and the woman did that oh
[2:03:58] she just had a few strings of that
[2:04:00] handkerchief tied on the baby's foot and
[2:04:02] one morning she went to get the baby and
[2:04:05] the Lord had been there that night come
[2:04:10] on somebody that I love the scripture
[2:04:12] say weeping me and do it for a night but
[2:04:13] joy coming tomorrow
[2:04:15] do you know when we wouldn't heard the
[2:04:17] quote where the angel the Lord passed
[2:04:18] through the neighborhood but this time
[2:04:19] the prophecy
[2:04:20] the Lord Himself showed up that night
[2:04:22] hallelujah somebody all we waiting on
[2:04:25] him wait we just waiting on God to show
[2:04:27] up this situation gonna change
[2:04:29] listen say say she brought he said said
[2:04:34] where my women and she brought the baby
[2:04:36] I'm sorry
[2:04:37] and the woman did that just a few stream
[2:04:39] through streams of the ankle of table
[2:04:41] read foot one morning she went to get
[2:04:43] the baby the Lord had been there that
[2:04:44] night and the baby's foot was straight
[2:04:46] and she brought the baby to the meeting
[2:04:49] to show and brought the strings that was
[2:04:52] left on the handkerchief and hand had
[2:04:55] the baby's picture before and where it
[2:04:58] was then how the little baby's foot was
[2:05:00] clubbed in like that a little baby about
[2:05:02] eight or ten months old and there was
[2:05:04] the little baby's foot just as normal
[2:05:06] any other baby now what if she just
[2:05:09] throw the handkerchief away and say well
[2:05:12] that's that's where we missed the
[2:05:15] blessings don't throw it away don't
[2:05:18] throw the promise away that's where we
[2:05:20] miss the blessings we're afraid to wait
[2:05:24] on God hallelujah we're afraid to wait
[2:05:27] on God just a little bit so you see you
[2:05:31] heard that only wait again I hear that
[2:05:33] whisper only wait it won't be very long
[2:05:35] even now the father's hand is pleading
[2:05:38] soon with Jesus we will sing the victory
[2:05:41] song that's right just wait on God
[2:05:43] believe it confess it stay with it and
[2:05:49] God will bring it to pass for you
[2:05:51] believe it confess it stay with it God
[2:05:56] will bring it to pass for you I love
[2:05:59] that I want to just kind of slip over
[2:06:01] here I'll kind of cut back on some of my
[2:06:05] notes but you know as we talk about this
[2:06:08] war strategy a man and we're just going
[2:06:11] back we're taking what we see here in
[2:06:16] what we see here through the church ages
[2:06:19] and I'm sorry through through the seven
[2:06:21] virtues and and what we're doing is
[2:06:24] applying these different virtues to
[2:06:26] different things that happen in
[2:06:28] Scripture different wars that might have
[2:06:29] happened in Scripture and when I thought
[2:06:31] about this there were a couple of them
[2:06:33] that came to mind but the one that I
[2:06:34] wanted to use today was a man the war
[2:06:37] strategy found in Joshua because as we
[2:06:40] as we talked about Josh was there having
[2:06:43] a conversation with the captain of the
[2:06:46] Lord's host he went approaching the
[2:06:47] captain of Laura's home said nine and
[2:06:49] noticed Johnson went standing back
[2:06:50] waiting look look
[2:06:51] I know God gave us this land and God
[2:06:54] already told me as I was with Moses so
[2:06:57] will I be with you say not even not one
[2:06:59] man to be able to stand before you so
[2:07:01] Joshua did not have any fear Joshua
[2:07:05] would approach him a man the captain

[2:07:17] recognize that this was the
[2:07:19] of God Joshua bowed himself to our own
[2:07:22] owners on his face and he began to
[2:07:24] worship Lord ah the same experience
[2:07:26] where Moses was told to take off his
[2:07:28] shoes in the presence of God

[2:15:53] here we wind this up out of the message
[2:15:56] we would see Jesus the Prophet says now
[2:15:59] I believe that all Scripture is given by
[2:16:02] inspiration and the scripture has got to
[2:16:05] be right or all of it right or there
[2:16:08] might be that if we could say some of
[2:16:11] its right and some of its not right then
[2:16:14] we get we get ourselves all mixed up I
[2:16:16] just believe that it's all the truth now
[2:16:19] I may not be able to have faith to make
[2:16:21] it all manifest it it's promised and so
[2:16:24] forth to bring them to pass but I will
[2:16:27] never stand in somebody's way that does
[2:16:29] have faith to do it amen I might not
[2:16:33] climb where Enoch did and take an
[2:16:36] afternoon walk with God and go home with
[2:16:38] her
[2:16:38] I might not have that much faith and I
[2:16:41] might not have enough faith to shout
[2:16:43] like Joshua that knocked the walls down
[2:16:46] but I certainly not stand in anyone's
[2:16:48] way who does have that type of faith a
[2:16:52] Manny Manny Manny man yeah I just made
[2:16:56] the comment I said if God God would show
[2:16:58] give up if God before God be with us

[2:17:03] one next I just said that

[2:20:26] I be with you but before the walls fell
[2:20:29] Joshua March according to the chief
[2:20:32] captain's orders see that's why I said

[2:20:47] thirteen times before the Powell God
[2:20:49] ever struck the thing he marched the
[2:20:52] on the wall and sounded the trumpet
[2:20:53] according to the Word of God that the
[2:20:56] chief captain told him out there when he
[2:20:59] met him he marched according to the Word
[2:21:00] of God what did he do he acted upon the
[2:21:04] word before he saw the miracle you know
[2:21:08] just a sound a trumpet don't shake down
[2:21:11] a wall that you can run chariot races
[2:21:14] around sounding a trumpet but God said

[2:21:20] and the last day March 7 7 and 13 times
[2:21:24] and as you go around the wall at the
[2:21:26] last time let the priest go before with
[2:21:29] the art and sound the trumpet and when
[2:21:31] the trumpet sounds the walls will shake
