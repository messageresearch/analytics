promises amen he never fails uh you should sing a song he never failed me yet he never failed me yet Jesus Christ never failed me yet so so we believe he uh he won't fail amen Psalm 91 says this is he that dwelleth in the secret place of the most high shall abide under the shadow of the Almighty I will save the Lord he is my refuge and my Fortress my God and him will I trust surely he shall deliver thee From The Snare of the Fowler and from the noise and pestilence he shall cover thee with his feathers and under his wings shalt thou trust his truth shall be thy shield and buckler Thou shalt not be afraid for the terror by night nor for the arrow that flyeth by day nor for the pestilence that walketh in darkness Norm for the destruction that wasteth at Noonday a thousand shall fall at thy sight and ten thousand at thy right hand but it shall not come nigh thee that is God's promise directly to you it shall not come nigh thee it'll go all around you but it's not gonna come nighty amen

befall thee neither shall any plague come nigh thy dwelling amen the reason why for he shall give his angels charge over thee to keep thee and all thy ways they shall bear thee up in their hands lest thou Dash thy foot against the stone Thou shalt tread upon the line and out of the Young Lion and the dragon shall not trample upon trample under feet because he has set his love upon me therefore

thanks I wanted to give a a quick update on on the missions and what we as spirit and Tabernacle have done this year in terms of in terms of missions report so let's go to the next slide um so this Mission supported areas Pakistan Ukraine Malawi and vision books is what we have so far next slide okay so here's um uh uh a situation in Pakistan we have a brother earthquake hit here and damaged his house and so it was a pastor actually so we were able to send some funds to help him repair his house there man um UK I mean Ukraine war um this is uh a greeting from some of the uh sister there you want to go ahead and play that go back go back one yeah is the mute okay sorry um it really we give questions I mean it's just which is foreign foreign let's see before I mean so I is I thought it was important for you guys to hear from their own voice of other things that we're dealing with that they're dealing with next slide and this one um this one is just recently that was kind of like at the beginning or early on in it um and this this is a video of they're still doing uh going through some challenges um so okay like that okay so that's just that's another family um as we're continuing to support we support it through uh um brother Barry coffee there at uh Hickory Bible Tabernacle so we send funds through them and and that's how to get it next okay don't play yet and here um this is in Malawi and in Malawi they went through they had a cyclone that hit and devastated the area pretty bad I mean um I think let me show some of it but what what was happening here is they lost everything pretty much right and so the families didn't have food didn't have anything and so we were had the opportunity to support the families there um I think it was like 100 would support a family right so what we sent we sent enough to support 15 families right amen thank you and this is a a a a video of them kind of preparing the the food for the different families foreign for that next slide and this is a uh them celebrating and rejoicing for being homeless and hungry and being able to get some of the receipts on it but go ahead [Music] thank you [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] foreign so as you can imagine you know not having any food and what that would do is the Lord has blessed them and given them some food so that Jubilation that you're you're seeing is just them expressing what God has done for them [Applause] and this is a one of the brothers um giving thanks to uh for the donations that we've given them go ahead please Okay so and that's so that's a Malawi so you can see how we're uh spirit and true for reaching out in the world in terms of missions next slide please go back one okay double click on that so this is Vision books and vision books their mission is to uh print the message and you have to do Escape first print a message and which in remote areas there's no um message books being given out anymore right so for the the brother Barry had the vision to um go ahead and uh print books and bibles we send Bibles we send other printed material like the Hoffman head of Christ and those things so and this is a go back this is a newsletter that uh we um are in now in the process of Distributing I can't remember if it's going to be monthly or quarterly um but I work on the board with for vision books as brother Jack has mentioned before so um we're now kind of like gearing up to provide information and and and and show what Vision books is doing to help the Believers particularly in the remote areas and we'll see that where where we're reaching at right now so next slide all right this is uh brother Branham um a quote from Brother Branham um always my heart steel Burns for overseas to see that the great need of the people in this in that country and how they are so loving and want to receive the Gospel so bad they just want to hear about the Lord Jesus okay so that's just a quote from Brother Branham it's continuing on his um the mission next spot and this is just brother Barry he's writing um uh just supporting thinking of people who says just read this part uh your support makes it possible for vision books to meet the need of providing the message to Believers worldwide in every language on Earth right so the interpretation not only do we there's interpreters who interpret the message and print them and put them in print as well next and so these are the countries right so this is where the the uh the books are going and we as a church we provide 300 a month to support this this mission and they reach in all of those countries you can see there amen all right thanks and this is just some of the Saints who were receiving some of the books um there's a distribution center um that we uh Vision books have opened and provided so there's a distribution in Malawi and that distribution is Center actually receives the books and then they're out to able to send them out to the different countries and remote areas as well thanks okay so this is just kind of like the chair division that's what it is that we have set up a PayPal for donation cash app for donations and if you interested in normal or you can do their website their visionbooks.org and if you want to get the arm on the list for the newsletter we can make that happen as well okay thank you accomplish foreign we thank the Lord that uh we have an opportunity to make an impact uh in other places in the world I I know one thing God does not forget our labor and uh and and and and what we're doing here sometimes uh you know 25 uh for us uh it can be spent in one meal uh but for people can feed them for a whole month and uh so when we you know we just just give a little bit you know it just kind of helps the uh uh it helps somebody else so we encourage you just continue to give towards the missions they manage it can uh a little bit goes a long way in in other places let me have the announcements amen for this morning and uh we will do that and I think uh Sister Sarah you have a song okay so Cicero bring us a special then we'll have the word of the Lord all right so we have a birthday uh coming up uh brother Josue Elias Ramon amen Brotherhood Elias Ramon um he's gonna be celebrating is this one year amen one year for him on May 6 what a what a blessing amen what a blessing for that so that's Saturday May 6th so we wish him a

Facebook sat Tabernacle um and our church website uh also we do streaming john423.org sisters will continue their virtual prayer um on Tuesday at 7 30 and they were telling me about um one of the ladies that was prayed for I believe it was a co-worker of sister Virginia's uh she was prayed for God healed her and she came back on this on the sister's prayer line to give thanks you know just give an update and uh ever since that time she gave things she's also been connected uh to the sister's prayer and uh it's just good to see that this is just kind of going uh outside of just where we are and I know sometimes you know uh many have said we can't wait till we can get our own building come back and pray uh in the building I think that's good but let's let's not detract from what's going on here virtually because we're reaching people that we probably would have never met uh reached before you know so we thank God for uh what is happening here through the virtual prayer and and sister started this off years ago and other brothers finally got on board and got behind it um you know and and we're doing ours every other Tuesday night but it's been a real blessing amen thus far

you to first we'll go to Second Corinthians amen second Corinthians the 12th chapter beginning at the ninth verse say Amen when you have it oh my what a she'll appreciate the specials it's the Abbey and uh my god sister cable all right all right I was trying to hold it together back there but y'all know I'm a bag of water just leaking back this is the Capers you got me God bless you God bless you my sister amen not to miss uh Sarah I appreciate that too good to see all those that are here amen The Storm Is Passing Over amen right I'm reminded of another song amen speak to the storm speak to the Rain you have the power to bring about a change amen amen second Corinthians uh the 12th chapter ninth verse amen and he said unto me my grace is sufficient for thee 12 12 second Corinthians 12th chapter 9 second Corinthians yeah 12th chapter 9 verse and he said unto me my grace is sufficient for thee for my strength is made perfect in weakness amen it will stop right there amen let us go over to judges a man the sixth chapter will start to take a little reading from the first verse amen y'all pray for me amen and it reads uh and the children of Israel did evil in the sight of the Lord and the Lord delivered them into the hand of Midian seven years and the Hand of Midian prevailed against Israel and because of the midianites the children of Israel made them dens which are in the mountains and caves and strongholds may the Lord add a blessing to the reading of his word you may be seated amen this morning oh my we want to take a title a man from the prison house to the Palace from the prison to the Palace amen and uh we see here if we continue right here on the on in in second Corinthians amen uh my strength is made perfect in weakness and verse 10 say therefore I take pleasure and infirmities reproaches in necessities and persecutions in distress for Christ's sake you see we often uh discouraged by all of these negative things that come about in our lives but we think uh that uh for us to be victorious amen we have to uh uh uh be strong and not have trials amen you see but because uh uh of of these things amen the Lord is working out his perfect will in our lives amen so in order to be strong Paul teaches us that sometimes we have to not rely on our human abilities we have to rely on God's ability amen sometimes as people we begin to rely too much on our own ability and uh when we do that sometime we miss step and and and and and and and and we get ourselves in God's way here amen so we're going to be taking our text this morning amen we're going to be typing here uh uh uh and judges we see where the the middle uh uh Israel had gotten themselves in in quite a pickle got themselves in trouble and uh uh uh we'll we'll see as we go on into the message here how how uh uh the midianites had came and and got them in bondage hey man I want you to pay close attention to that word bondage amen because bondage amen is a form of being in prison amen can I preach this morning and and and we see that um this types A lot of uh of today many people are in prison amen and uh the sad thing about it is they don't know it all right all right amen y'all pray for me amen so we see hearing judges it says that judges 14 the six after the Lord looked upon and said go in this thy might Thou shalt save Israel from the hand of the minute night so he's talking to Gideon here wow okay I have have not I sent thee God has sent a prophet to that generation amen and he sent the prophet to this generation because see we will uh uh in prison amen and and uh we needed to come out of bondage amen so the 16th uh verse here says and the Lord said unto him surely I will be with thee and thou shall Smite the midianite says one man see when the Lord is fighting in your state see the midianites had a great Army they were they they was a a mini number but he said that I would fight with you and they would be as one man all right amen so uh I want to look at the word here we we in the scripture there it says that uh that the power of Christ May rest upon them therefore I take pleasure in infirmities uh in the reproaches Necessities persecution amen and distresses for Christ's sake now I want to uh if we take a take our time here to kind of build up instead of platform amen we want to take and sort of delve into this word just a little bit pleasure I'm I'm gonna take this off because I feel a little constricted I tried to keep it on my wife said you keep the coat on I tried I can't preacher I think thank you bro I got to come out the coat hope that's okay amen but we look at the word Joy sometimes we can lose our joy along the journey amen the Devil comes to kill steal and destroy amen he comes to take our joy so the dictionary meaning of the word Joy is a Feeling of great pleasure and happiness the emotion evoked by well-being success or good fortune by a prospect of uh uh possessing what one desires amen are you with me that brings an experience of great pleasure Joy is an inward emotion of our spirit it is a Feeling that we all love to experience and it's it is actually something that God has designed for us to have remained in US and that this Joy might be full amen amen amen every normal human being on the earth desires to be happy and have their lives filled with joy peace contentment and so they're all of their desires amen this is why the more pleasure no let me back it up miss something very important there in the human heart there is a deep that God placed in the human spirit that can only be satisfied by another deep only God can truly Supply amen so this is why uh uh uh we find that the devil amen he comes against the joy the true Joy and would give you a substitute amen that you think is joy come on he will give you a substitute a man of pleasure amen that is not godly pleasure but it is a worldly pleasure amen so we see here amen that Satan is also handing out pleasure all right the Bible talks about the pleasure of sin is death see sin is pleasurable but it has a baggage connected to it that is death see but God didn't just didn't want you to be have not pleasure he has provided ultimate pleasure but sometimes we get a little bit confused on what pleasure really is Psalm 16 and 11 says Thou shalt show me the past of life God reveals to you that he has your pathway all mapped out yeah and if we go on there in 16 Psalm 16 11 she says that will show you the path of life and in thy presence is the fullness of joy and at thy right hand there are Pleasures forevermore amen so we see here amen that God desires you to have pleasure okay he designed your body in such a way amen that you can experience pleasure all right amen the human body is designed in such a way that uh uh at experiences of pleasure there are certain reactions that happen within your body all right amen the scientists looked into it and they've named these different things they are called dopamines and pheromones and these kind of things go to popping amen and and and and when we are in an experience of exuberant pleasure your body and everything sort of responds Amen to the way you feel and all I love to feel pleasure man when something good happens to us amen we can't fight the smile that comes upon our faith we can't fight the feeling that we feel within our heart and all we just so happy amen Bible says in Revelation the fourth chapter 11th verse Thou Art Worthy of Lord worthy O Lord to receive glory honor and Power for thou has created all things for what for thy pleasure that is God himself loves pleasure amen so we see in that data that that that that that pleasure is not an evil thing all right even God loves pleasure amen all things was created for him before his pleasure amen but you see that old devil he comes and he gives you a false pleasure a perverted pleasure amen and the joy that is connected with it is sin mine sin is the main source of that pleasure amen pleasure that is connected to sin is a perverted pleasure it is perverted from the genuine pleasure that the Lord wanted us to have amen see he's nothing but a copycat he can't create nothing on his own but he stood back in the shadows and he watched everything that God did there had in the Garden of Eden and after God did everything he stepped back and said it's perfect so he said wow now what I can do is I can come and pervert what he's done that was pure love at that time so he come and he pervert love he he's a perverter of everything that God has done he's just a copycat right right amen amen so God designed us for the right kind of pleasure amen amen amen of the deepest level of joy the long lasting pleasure lasting satisfaction that the world is unable to give This Joy I have right the world didn't give it to me and the world can't take it away You by all of your modern forms of entertainment and technology is a mere substitute of the pleasure that God has amen in thy presence is the fullness of joy There's No Greater Joy No Greater pleasure amen than being in the presence of God it is the ultimate pleasure [Music] pleasure that you feel amen if when you know the spirit of God is right there a few weeks back we were here in service and right back in that corner I can't recall what was going on I don't believe it was song service or whatever it's going forth but something happened I don't know about nobody else but I felt the feeling I felt the presence of the Lord I believe the sister Verner felt it sister Verner felt I said my God that he is here there was such a atmosphere that was such a move of God see you gotta stay sensitive I didn't know what to do I just started bending and praising God and oh Lord I had to fight back tongues and as I kind of caught myself I saw that whole code over there felt in that place that's the pleasure that I want to live in but we see Satan a lot of times people gave themselves in a little bit of trouble and during that time amen they go off the straight and narrow paths they begin Amen to start looking for pleasure elsewhere they start looking for pleasure amen some look for pleasure and drugs some searching for pleasure amen and uh cigarettes which is just a gateway to something else that's right right some start looking for pleasure in alcohol right some look for pleasure right in how they look oh my God right some look for pleasure in attention oh if I can just dress a certain way to get the boy's attention all right I feel good about myself I feel it's hurt oh I makes me feel so good careful you're slipping down a slippery slope now there's no doubt the prophet said it's natural for a woman to want to feel pretty but be careful because the devil can work in that amen that you can get a spirit on you amen become a tool for the devil that's right now sometimes in in these things people your devil get you searching for this worldly pleasure and he'll set a trap for you right you found yourself out there and you're doing things and you get in trouble with the law because you're searching for pleasure wow and you get yourself bound up Amen in bondage right you get yourself Tangled all up right and you find yourself in the prison house even in the prison he's still giving you pleasure oh my there's a word here that's called uh uh what is it uh uh uh uh when you get into jail and you don't want to get out you become institutionalized wow wow you find yourself after you've been in prison for quite some time and you don't and you're feeling this worldly pleasure you don't even know what real pleasure is wow and you begin to get so dependent upon that pleasure you can no longer function in society wow you begin to find pleasure even in bondage and you begin to oh oh well this is that's not even fundamental God is trying to free you and want to free you from your sin and uh you don't even want to leave cause you got institutionalized now did a little research in that and it says here the social effects occur in two stages of the prison life a period of confinement and re-entry into society okay confinement and then re-entry into society all inmates experience prisonization this is what this is called it's called prisonization and they also experience a reduced social status upon their return to the community the result is often a lonely helpless life for the former in me the main psychological fact of imprisonment is self-condemnation guilt boredom result resulting in losses of perspective and of self-confidence after release the prisoners are often withdrawn from others they also feel hostile towards Society and the criminal and and the criminal justice system and constantly anxious now we know from the message that these are just Spirits all right amen that I dare to keep you in bondage these are spirits from the pits of hell amen now imprisonment also multiplies their pre-existing financial problems there neither the government nor the community helps ex-offenders deal with their problems inmates often receive vocational training in there during their confinement but seldom obtain employment in the job area following their release as a result former inmates are highly vulnerable to Future criminal involvement wow true amen amen so even one shot he still got his claws well Johnny your release ain't got no job how am I going to get by in the world so all of these now on your way out take these with you We Gonna Let You Go but we we got a rope on you yeah yeah we got a rope on you and I hope y'all see The Parallax he got a rope on you I know you're gonna mess up again cause we have we have established something in you you left but we put something on the inside of you amen that you can't get rid of so so what happens is they have these places called halfway houses these kind of places are designed amen uh to help the the the the the the the uh prisoner of the inmate or the the convict or whatever acclimate themselves back into society and they go to a certain house and they live at the house and at that house they have uh uh they they give them room and board and help them find the work and and and and and it usually comes with counseling to help them acclimate themselves back into society amen so we see amen that that that that that you may have guiding yourself in a little trouble amen that is our natural instance of how prison works amen now there's a spiritual application amen you may uh uh have have done some things amen we were all once in that prison confinement amen and because of that prison confinement that we found ourselves in amen we took on certain Spirits in our lives and Satan even though we're trying to go free he got a rope on us always uh uh uh tugging at you right amen and and because amen uh you got in there and you you made certain friends on the inside amen and and upon your release and upon their release guess what they're coming and trying to continue that friendship amen they say a lot of times a criminal will go into the prison the prison industry and he come out a better Criminal why because he just go in and he learned more tricks of the trade amen and just become a better Criminal amen and we see here that uh that that in life amen uh Satan is trying to Butch you in confinement amen he wants to put you in prison amen and how does he put you in prison he used something that you already know that you are have because he watched God put it in you and you know that you enjoy pleasure amen and he can give you a little something from the gambling house Amen to give you a feeling the next thing you know you're robbing trying Amen to support that gambling habit all right and you begin to start breaking natural man's laws amen and he gave you something else and you feel pretty or whatever More and You Begin to get out on the streets and you find yourself you done broke the man's law and find out and pray but what about God's law amen and you find yourself in a prison and a bondage Satan has got you in that prison by he's got you in that bondage amen and you don't know how to get out wow amen so we got to stay out of the prison house amen but uh uh the prison house is necessary amen the prison house is necessary I want to read a quote here amen uh see if I have it amen I don't have the uh the location of it but uh Johnny crew how many familiar with old Johnny Crowe Prophet says here not long ago an old farmer uh had a cornfield and the crow kept coming by and eating his corn so he set a trap and caught one he said I'll fix the rest of them he tied the one's foot and and to the fence and the poor old crow hobbled and jumped and hobbled and jumped and he couldn't get away all right amen and because he was tied up he was starving he could only eat an occasional kernel of corn that uh fell in his vicinity amen he began to starve to them he got just over he could hardly fly amen and he could hardly jump up and down anymore one of the ultimate freedoms amen is being able to fly we sing the song that some glad morning when this life is over I'll Fly Away the ultimate form of Freedom amen like that eagle is to be able to saw a man amongst the clouds amen so he wanted to be free amen but he had a teaser Amen on his foot and he was chained to a certain area right amen and all the other crows come by and holler Johnny Crow let's go amen let's go south it's turning winter uh you'll die sitting there right Amen in all other crows didn't understand what was wrong with old Johnny Crowe why don't he come why don't he listen and they begin to talk about it what's wrong with you why don't you listen but they didn't understand he had a talent on her that's right let's see what happened after a while that tether kept holding him down and he got so weak amen that one day the farmer came and took the tether off right I'm sorry let me finish reading my story y'all get me ahead of myself I go blame that on y'all Glory the prophet said right one day a good man up came out and said that poor old crow look at him hobbling around and he's getting weak so he caught the old fella petted him a little bit amen and took him off the latch off of his foot then turned him loose and said all right old boy you can go now and he walked away and the old crow just kept walking around in the same Circle he didn't have confidence on what the man said that you can go now amen because he had been tethered there for so long amen that now it was a mental thing amen he couldn't get over the fact amen that oh this felt pretty good oh I'm familiar with these here in this environment so I think I'll just stay here even though we was free and he could saw with the other other crows and saw us the heavens he had got institutionalized and found pleasure in that little confined area that all right and the crow he said come on Johnny Crow let's go south the winter is coming and you die why should ye hear until you die that's the way it is with men and women tonight or today I should say who don't know their position in Christ the devil may have you tied up with tuberculosis he may have you tied up with cancer he may have you tied up with many things but Christ the good man has stood your judgment now and has set you free tonight God bless your heart you can rise in power of the Holy Ghost let not let's not go south uh but let's go towards Glory marching as a great Invincible Army at the Living God we're free this morning amen can't you hear the others saying come on all right what I once was bound by chains of sin but today I've been cut loose by Jesus Christ amen amen so you see amen that we're battling amen not just with a physical confinement amen but it's a spiritual confinement amen it's a spiritual bondage amen that we finds ourselves in sometimes amen and sometimes uh we're battling the thoughts of our own mind amen let's look here and judges and we see the many nights found themselves I'm sorry Israel found themselves in bondage amen and God had told Gideon to I want you to go have not I sent thee to set the people free amen amen the challenge to get in and coming to the union Amen to bring his thoughts into the union of God's thoughts see this story of Gideon was written for us in this day in this end time that would also amen see there there there let's look at uh real quick here uh uh getting ahead of myself amen God bless you God bless you let's look at the fourth seal the fourth seal amen uh get that up and I wanna I wanna read something here uh amen amen we want you to I want to show you here where uh Gideon I'm sorry Israel they were hell bondage amen uh uh uh about a million nights and there were three powers amen there that that that held them amen amen we will get to it at this goal and we see here that Gideon didn't have confidence that he was able to deliver because it was a a great Harmony amen and and and and and and and here we go praise the Lord the story of getting the end time when there were three powers that was gathered in against us in this day amen three power because see there were three uh uh there was the malachites there was the Canaanites and then they think it was the children of the North amen and these three powers had come together Amen to come against Israel amen and they had them in bondage they had them encamped let's just read it judges amen amen sixth chapter the third verse and so it was when Israel had sown that the midianites came up and the amalekites and the children of the East even came against them and they encamped against them and destroyed them and destroyed the increase of the Earth and destroyed the increase of the earth to Thou come and to Gaza and left no sustenance for Israel see took away their ability to nourish themselves amen neither sheep nor Ox nor as for they came up with their cattle and their tents they came up as grasshoppers for multitude for both they and their camels were without number and they entered into the land to destroy it and Israel was greatly impoverished because of the minionites and the children of Israel Cried unto the Lord and and it came to pass when the children of Israel Cried unto the Lord because of the manyanites the Lord set a prophet unto the children of Israel so we see here uh it's just like today amen the false fear but the Brand number told us that notice the Antichrist it is on a Pale Horse amen mixed colors a horse is a beast that represents a power his power is all mixed up why it's politics it's National powers and its religious powers it's demon powers it's all kind of powers mixed together The Pale Horse He was a he's got all kinds of powers amen but Jesus come it's on a solid horse amen the word amen but we see that Pale Horse amen is a mixture of the White Horse amen it's a mixture of the Black Horse and the red horse see we have those same Powers amen that's coming against us today amen some people uh get tied up and get in bondage Amen in the religious powers amen that has come to put us in bondage in this hour some people get tied up in politics amen and some people just getting themselves out on The Deep End Amen and find themselves in all kind of trouble where they got all kind of demons oppressions and suppressions and all kind of things hanging on them and they want to be free amen but they need somebody to lead them to Freedom amen but even when the person is leading them to Freedom amen they they find themselves not having confidence that they're actually free in their own mind amen but the battle is in their own mind amen they have to be able to come overcome the bondage of their own thoughts if they can ever get their thoughts Amen in line with God's thoughts amen they'll go free amen and they'll never look back amen but the battle amen is to get their thoughts in line with God's thoughts right amen but you got these three great Powers amen that are constantly making a noise amen see the Israel amen was there and they heard the noise and then what happens is fear set in I mean we have a great Army to this side and the great Army to that side and a great armor to that side but Gideon he told the Lord told uh Gideon that I have to you have given you to deliver them right right amen and we had a prophet in this hour amen sent to deliver us amen out of our bondage amen are you glad about it so we look on here amen the story of Gideon and Gideon said unto if I will save Israel by my own hands thou Hast said now look look at the doubt amen that that Gideon had even though God had told him that Gideon's still he still wasn't convinced that he would be able to defeat this innumerable Army as it were only one man as only one man because he had began amen he had been to the school now I put this in there he had been to school and he knew how to add so when he had no we can't do this see what was it he was looking into himself he was looking into his own human ability amen if saying that or how can I do it such a great Army but he really got to realize that he had more with him amen because God had already told him to do amen [Music] so in verse 37 he says here behold I will put a fleece of wool in the floor and if to do be on the fleece only and it be dry upon the Earth besides then shall I know that that would save Israel by my hand and thou has said verse 38 and it was so he rose up early in the morning and on to on tomorrow and thrust the fleece together and ringed out the Dew out of the fleece and uh a bowl full of water see so God had begun he had to build up the confidence amen of of of of of uh Gideon Gideon was in his own self-doubt amen before he could go how can I go how can I lead this this Army amongst he had to build up his own uh uh confidence you see so we see that the same parallels amen was with our own prophet amen he gave Gideon three poles first he gave them the angel the the staff of the Angel into the bowl right and the next he told him he said if the fleece amen uh uh uh filled with water in the ground around the fleece was dry amen then after that he came back to him again and he said if you uh uh this time if the fleece was dry and the ground was wet around it see he gave him three pools Amen to get his confidence up that I am with you go and deliver the people amen we gotta understand my brothers and sisters that is a supernatural Amen to the Bride of Jesus Christ is no longer a supernatural it's becoming a natural [Applause] the Supernatural is more natural than the supernatural if that makes sense and see that's what we're getting to we're coming to a place amen where we expect the supernatural we have to bring our mind thoughts Amen in in line with his thoughts amen so many times people we write the supernatural love to see things but this we this is a common occurrence this is natural for us this is not everyone's jumping and tripping over themselves well we praise the Lord because this is what he do every day that's what they do every day exactly so we go on here and we see amen that uh get in uh was had to go through these uh things to bring his confidence in line with God's confidence amen and see these the same things that you have to go through amen there's things and uh uh torments and things in your life amen and ask God deliver you from this amen and he deliver you from that and he answered that prayer and he answers this prayer to bring your confidence up amen so that you can realize amen that you can go free amen though what happened sometime amen let's get back to the story here you can get out of prison and like I said there's a rope amen that's connected to you you want to go free but the the things that you've done in your past are always hunting all right and you feel like I can't go free because of the things that I've done amen because of the things that I say because of the way that I've acted because of the way that I've responded amen but I'm here to tell you this morning amen that there's a good man amen that is coming loose the shackles this morning and you can go free amen amen we find a lot of times that that in the course of Life uh we get ourselves so tangled up amen much like the children of Israel here and we need to get in we get ourselves so bound up in religious dogmas we find ourselves so confused amen that we don't know what's up or down amen but God today has sent us to get in in this hour Amen to lead you out of the clutches of a great Army amen there's so many things against us amen we have the political happen Amen in there they're instituting laws amen laws that say men can get married now they're instituting laws amen that those against God's law amen that's a political pressure amen and we're beginning to see now amen that religious uh the religious world is is is is coming into his place and man in their pudding amen uh stipulations on people Amen in there about the Bible says that it'll be soaked the prophets they'll be so close amen that of the food the very elect if it was possible yeah amen would see that they're uh having uh uh uh a week-long services and everything confusing the people they're up there and and all the the fire is falling oh there's a Revival and ain't nobody said nothing how do you have a uh and ain't nothing sad all y'all doing is singing for weeks and weeks at a time ain't nobody preaching nothing and y'all call it a Revival but you know what it has stimulated the pleasure senses and you're feeling all right but like I here to tell you that it's gonna take more amen than having your pleasure feel good it's gonna take the sword amen of the word of God it's gonna take a supernatural God Amen we come not in words of speech of the power and demonstration of the Holy Ghost [Applause] amen it's gonna take more than enticing words amen people you got to see something inside Amen to bring you out of bondage amen the bondage of your own thoughts amen everybody think they're right how can you tell me this how can you tell me that I'm not speaking to you from my own I'm speaking you to the voice of a prophet and that Prophet said that I'm the voice of God to you amen amen that's right one of the hardest things it is to get to people Amen to hear a prophet in this house all right amen there's so much against them amen sometimes and the people that are are got a demon power you found yourself so deep in sin and disgust amen that you can't even go free anymore you try to go free you let out amen but there's a rope always pulling your back why you got to cut away those old friends amen you got to cut away those things I was holding you you can't waddle in that kind of stuff you can't come to God and then go back and hang with your same friends you gotta cut them off you got to turn your back on your friend sometimes you got to turn your back on family sometimes you gotta turn your back on everything that is against God you have to get yourself with a good counselor you have to find yourself a good halfway house amen and you have to stay there stay there and to God and line your thoughts amen with his hopes and they give you power Amen to go forth give you the confidence amen that you can overcome amen so he's going to have to do that by showing you that he is with you you follow him and then you kill her say Lord he gave me a job hallelujah thank you Jesus if he can do that what else can he do and then he come and he bless you with something else and he said oh my if he did that what else you can do and then you begin to read the line of joy and what you feel for pleasure amen the old man is falling away amen behold all things I've been coming new you begin to reset your pleasure sisters all those things don't give me pleasure no more amen I found a new way of living Amen in this Joy I'm finding Joy like I never felt before you begin to say to yourself I can hardly wait for the church doors open because that's where I find joy peace in the presence of almighty God Amen I don't have to go to the crack house amen I don't have to go to the club amen I go to church and find joy I find joy in my home amen when I open up the scripture amen and I was going through something and when I'm all by myself and he answered my question Oh Lord I'm in the presence of the Lord Amen brother Jack was telling the testimony hi brother and sister cable is sitting there singing Amen in the atmosphere right there in the home right there in the home they finding Joy pleasure and being in the presence of the Lord amen amen amen many times amen we fine like the devil tries to pull us back Amen in those old scenes amen we see here in the scripture here your life story amen is my God no chest jumping all around y'all bear with me amen amen you love the Lord Psalms 90. and nine it says for all our days are passed away in our wrath we still we spend our years as a tale that is told so the Lord is is is is writing a story of your life from the beginning Amen to the end there and we see that uh certain events along the pathway of Our Lives amen uh uh uh uh uh like we see how God wrote the story of Joseph the events of Joseph life every man told the story amen but joy with Joseph was just a pawn we see how how he came from Jacob's house Amen to the prison house he had to go through the prison house Amen in order to find himself in the palace right right amen we see that uh uh uh Rahab the Harley amen she found herself Amen in prison conditions amen because of the things that she was involved in amen she could but she heard that there was a a group coming that there was a great Army coming and because of the respect she had for the Lord's people she found herself amen from the prison house of prostitution and found herself in the in the Palace of Solomon's house amen amen we see uh the pattern of of Ruth so you have to understand the patterns how God how God does things Ruth there with Naomi amen and she said I'll where you go I'll go and he she went with with Naomi and found herself there in the house of Boaz amen we see David one time found himself in the prison of his own thoughts he found himself in the prison of his mind because he he had weighed off and and and and looked on Bathsheba and he had did some things that he shouldn't have done but he said Lord if you can restore the joy of my salvation amen and he found himself amen restored amen he went from prison-like conditions amen and found himself into joy and pleasure amen seated with the father in Heavenly places amen we see amen that uh uh uh uh you have to go through prison-like conditions amen you have to go through the prison but he said that you can overcome amen we have a prophet in this hour a man that have told us some things that wasn't quite written in the book amen but why we can say because these things were written on the back side of the book and what it does is give us a revelation of who we are amen we went to the halfway house amen you can't just jump back into society you have to go to the halfway house and we have a great counselor amen that help us along the way show us things that we previously didn't know amen and restore us back to our rightful self again amen take us out of the bondage of denominational influence amen and put us back into the uh of the influence of almighty God Amen from the prison house to the Palace amen we see here amen that we we have to go uh back to the palace and job we see he was in a great prison house experience amen but he went through amen and he came out uh with a greater revelation of the Resurrection in his heart amen by going through the prison house amen so we're so happy today amen that the Lord has made a way of Escape here Amen in the message faith is Works expressed uh faith is Works expressed uh 1965 I preached in 1965 11 26. hey man we see that the prophet here amen was talking about people out of their mind he said they were out of the Mind their Twisted arms and legs amen beating their heads like that and she was crying saying deliver to people brother Branham said help us we're in trouble right amen yeah yeah amen praise the Lord Devil is a Lie amen amen they Twisted arms and legs beating their heads like that and she was crying saying deliver uh the people brother Branham said help us we're in trouble amen she herself I know her she belongs I believe to the Church of Christ amen or the Christian church called Church of the Brethren so she I look around and say I wish I could and go on and look around and my little bitty body and them great big iron bars those poor people in there and you couldn't get to them them iron balls were so close together and I looked and they were beating their heads like they were out of their minds see the prophet said that we're living in a in a in an age here of neurotics amen people want to go free amen but they don't know how to it's like they're beating their heads up against the bars amen they're losing their mind amen amen now notice in the age of we're almost uh sent into totally insane we've arrived at that point today in the prison House of this age I seen some lights flickering amen around I've seen some lights flickering around and there and I look upon I looked up and stood the Lord Jesus Christ and a light of rainbow around him he was looking right straight to me said deliver those people and he went away and I thought well how could I deliver them I haven't got strength enough Amen in my arms to break those bars see he was just like Gideon amen he was giving God excuses how can I do this amen and I said uh amen give those balls and I said House of Hell give way in the name of Jesus and all the crackling and popping and rocks rolling in bars of falling and people running screaming delivered and screaming to the top of their voices that I and was all delivered we see that's just like get in amen amen so once Gideon amen had a revelation okay Lord I can do this amen so he moved out amen judges the seventh chapter says he moved out then uh zaruba Bell who was getting in and all the people were with him rose up early in the morning and pinched their tents beside and The Well of Herod and the host of Minion there on the North side by the hill of Mori in the valley and the Lord said unto Gideon the people are with thee are too many megive uh with me to and me to give the million nights into their hands let's Israel Vault themselves against me saying my own hand has saved thee in order for the word amen you have to become weak enough amen see that's just stick you see it Gideon was looking within his own human ability and like I said before he could do the math amen see he was looking within his own ability amen what we have to not look within our own ability amen but look at the word of God not my own ability but what you say Lord amen see you're not weak enough yet amen you're still looking within yourself you still got a little too much strength amen you're still a little too sassy you're still a little a little too strong amen I got to get you weak amen so you say God delivered me amen we see the same thing here we get in the beginning and you're too strong you got too many people now beginning at the beginning of the conflict amen he was doubtful because it was so many people and you're not adding to my Harmony but you're demand finishing it amen right you're not weak enough so see a lot of time amen we have things going through in our lives see a lot of times people think that uh because you get saved amen all of a sudden all of the problems are going away no but now we got the weaken you we got to start picking things off of you amen we got to take the you out of you and place God in there amen you're not weak enough yet amen you're still relying on your own abilities amen we can't rely on our own abilities amen so we go on here now therefore go and Proclaim in the years of the people saying whosoever is fearful and Afraid let him turn and depart early Amen to Mount Gilead and their return of people twenty and two thousand remained ten thousand people twenty and two thousand and there remain ten thousand the message uh uh uh uh the gone forth amen so we see that Gideon's Army had become smaller uh and smaller amen and the Lord said to get in the people are yet too many again the people are yet too many in other words you need to be even weaker all right are you you are still too strong of yourself you got to die some more right amen is still too much you involved right amen bring them down into the water and I will try them for thee there and it shall be that of whom I say unto thee this shall go down go with thee and the same shall go with thee and of whomsoever I say unto thee this shall not go with thee the same shall not go so he brought down the people unto the water and the Lord said unto Gideon everyone that lapeth up the water with his tongue as a dog lapis him shout thou set by himself likewise everyone that bows down upon his knee to drink and the number of them that lap putting their uh hand to their mouth there were 300 men but all the rest of the people bowed down upon their knees to drink the water and the Lord said unto Gideon by three but the Lord said unto Gideon by the 300 men that lapped will I save you to deliver the midianites unto thine hand and let all the other people go every man unto his place so the peoples took uh Victors and their hands in their hands and their trumpets and set at the rest of Israel every man unto his tent took and retained those 300 amen and the hosts of Midian was beneath him in the valley so those 300 men's armed with no weapons but only trumpets and vessels amen weak weaker they could only they they they they they didn't have such great weapons and and things of that nature I'll see the math just didn't add up anymore all right hey man the mouth just didn't add up hey man it was much like Joseph amen he would weakest Point Amen in prison amen didn't know how he was going to be lit but he found himself Amen in the palace we look at amen uh uh uh uh uh Abraham amen the Melchizedek came to Abraham and the two angels went down to Sodom Amen to deliver a a lot Amen in his family amen out of Sodom amen and we're living in sodomite conditions on today amen but see what happened was amen Sodom leading the family out amen but his wife Lot's wife turned in a heart amen she didn't actually turn to go back but her heart was still back in the what had happened she had become institutionalized amen and the devil had a rope on her so her heart was still there amen see you got to turn your back on the devil amen you got to create in me Lord a clean heart amen and renewal rights Spirit wishing me amen amen all right that's right so we see amen that he uh Gideon had to get weaker within himself amen he had to uh uh stop relying Amen on his own ability Amen to to deliver himself out of the bondage that he was in amen he had to in order to deliver Israel we see a man that uh uh uh our own father God has stepped down amen from glory amen and he he put on a robe of Flesh amen and he came down into a pest house amen into a prison Amen in order to deliver us out of our prison see we were born in sin shaped in iniquity amen we were born into prison-like conditions amen but God had to come and Deliver us but when he went down into prison amen and took the keys from Satan Amen on the third day he came back amen man he rose with death and Hell conquered amen with the keys to death hell and the grave Amen to Deliver Us from prison amen and told us that we didn't have to be prison anymore he said I go Amen to prepare a place for you that where I am amen you may be also and we had a prophet in this hour that came and told us that he says In My Father's House the word said in my father's house there's many mansions if it was not so I would not have told you so but our Prophet said wait wait a minute that just don't set right with me amen I just can't see it that way he said in my father's house there's many palaces he said well that makes more sense in my father's house it's Penny palaces see so what we're doing we're going from the prison house and God has a palace waiting for us amen we're going from the prison Amen to the Palace amen amen amen but you have to overcome your own thoughts have to overcome amen the conditions of being institutionalized amen you have to overcome and let the word deliver you amen and let the word have full full preeminence in your life amen you have to recondition yourself I'm reminded of a story a young lady amen uh uh that was in prison amen she the prophet said that she went out she would put on her short shorts and and go down there and find ourselves to just to see uh how she can get the boy's attention amen and the prophet said that he said that's the greatest tool that the devil has ever had the greatest tool he said he used it at the beginning and he'll use it at the end see she was still in bondage right she had he said now a lot of times we look at bondage we may think a person but sometimes amen uh I was looking at a story amen and a man had a dream or whatever it was and he went down into in into hell and he seen where uh uh this demon had uh this young lady on a leash amen she had had on a leash and and had a had a train like a dog amen and content could send that dog out Amen to do certain things do certain tricks and then pull it back snatch the dog back see it's just like that you're in bondage in bondage by that leash the devil has full control of you he man he lets you do what he wants you to do and anytime you try to go free he pulled that leash back wow like old Johnny Crow amen but Darko Johnny Crow one day Johnny Crow realized wait a minute my foot feel a little lighter see what had happened was Johnny Crow had got into the presence of the almighty God and he began to feel amen the presence of the Lord and Johnny Crowe began to lift his foot a little bit amen and he began to Flap his wings a little bit he said wait a minute something's different amen and the pleasure that he was feeling amen from going around that he began to venture out just a little bit he began to go a little bit further he began to feel the strength in his wings coming back he began to feel him that he could hop a little higher amen and he say oh now I'm free and he began to shout and he began to jump amen and he go free and never looked back at that cornyard again amen and just like the devil may have you Amen on a leash hey I'm here to tell you that God has taken the leash and he's broke the bondages of sin he's broke the bondages of a chains of the devil amen and you can go free this morning amen all you have to do is realize within your heart what God has done for you Amen to turn your back on the devil and go free let us stand to our feet [Applause] amen amen amen I don't know who may have amen the message may have been for it but see a lot of times in our lives amen we have to go through bondage conditions we have to go through conditions in our lives sometime to weaken us amen so that we can recognize that he loves us amen and he's loose to bounds sometimes you know we can be free and we can find ourselves going back into bondage you just have to become weaker if there's something conditioned in your life maybe from the past that you're struggling with [Music] we pray this

strong when I'm seeking your face and I've been touched by your grace oh foreign [Music] Hallelujah blessed be the name of the Lord amen you can just continue to play that softly sis we thoroughly appreciated the word of the Lord on today for my brother Troy from prison to the palace and sermons just loaded with nutrients um and just a wonderful example of when a person is leaving prison and how often times they are so affected by what happened to them and even though they've gone through and they've been given tools to try to be successful yet there are things in society that still stands against him and uh you know and when you see somebody I recently have watched that in a couple gentlemen's life they were released in prison and and uh one of the things that I saw them do the brother troll was talking about you know going to halfway house and and when you you know just doing everything you can getting the counselor that you need and one of the things I saw these gentlemen do we were we would get together on a call every morning at uh about it would be eight o'clock hour time but where they lived it would be about 6 30 in the morning six o'clock their time and they would get on that call and just listen to the word just listen to the word just listen to the word and uh and as they did that eventually God began to open up doors they got jobs and they got Vehicles they got all kind of things in order to kind of bring themselves back in society but what what started it is just staying connected with the word of God Amen stand connected to the word of God so I I just appreciated that this wonderful thought amen this morning from prison to the Palace God bless you brother Troy amen God bless you praise God and and that one quote that anytime I hear anybody read it uh you know House of Hell give way to the press to the name uh to the the name of the Lord Jesus Christ I had never heard that quote before and I've been in this message for years and the very first person that preached that that uh with that quote where I heard it for the first time was Caleb Wesco amen and I say House of Hell give way to the name of the Lord Jesus Christ bye I remember he he preached that uh I think it was a Friday night or some service we had and he brought that quote out and that thing it just stuck with me and and it's going with me many places all over the world that same quote but it's just so good to see amen how God used that extent that that that example in brother Brandon's life to show us that we were all in bondage but we needed Freedom we needed Freedom thank God that he sent us freedom amen praise the Lord God is good amen God is good um you all just be seated just for a moment amen uh I wanted to just uh take just a a tad bit of your time

has been done uh if it had not been for her uh tomorrow we'll be celebrating our 30th wedding anniversary amen [Applause] praise the Lord and um for myself you know I was just kind of reflecting in this thing and saying when we recording we didn't talk about uh Pastor in a church or any of that that was not part of our conversation and um you know we um uh we two young people that fell in love and got married and raised a family and and somewhere along the way God called us to all of what we're doing right now and um and and and and when God called uh us I mean I I just remember the whole process and and I was just praying that the Lord would just also speak to my wife I knew what he was telling me but I had to wait on the Lord wait on the Lord for him to speak to her and it began to deal with her and dreams and and as we begin to find out what the meaning of the dreams were we realized that this is nothing but the hand of Lord and and I and I appreciate her because she had to surrender as well uh to the perfect will of God Amen and then surrendering uh we have been able to um just help others Amen in our journey so we're very grateful for that so uh I wanted to uh say
