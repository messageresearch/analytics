straight into the Word of God the event how many are happy to be the presence of God in the house of the Lord s joy the man let's go to the book of Genesis if we can praise be to God Genesis chapter 5 verse 21 to 24 Genesis 5 21 to 24 the Lord is good what is become a little topic I think be sensitive to the inner mind you want to add a little peripheries influence amen be sensitive to the inner man influence and we'll chat a lot of break it down for us in Genesis 5 21 to 24 and and you know leave sixty and five years and begat methuselah and you know walk with God after he begat methuselah three hundred years and begat sons and daughters and all the days of Enoch wait 365 years and you know walk with God and he was not for God took him amen if a lot is to anyone that is good enough 21 to 24 let's go to first Corinthians 13 1993 13 first Corinthians chapter 13 9 to 13 1 Corinthians 10 to 19 13 the Lord is good 1 corinthians 13:9 to 13 for real or in part and we prophesy in part but that but when that which is perfect is come then that which is in part shall be done away when I was a child I speak as a child I understood as a child I thought as a child but when I became a man I put away childish things for now we see through a glass darkly but then face to face now I know in part but then but then shine but ash I know even as I also I am known and now abideth Faith Hope charity these three but the greatest of this is Charlie amen shall we be seated the Lord is good for his vinaigrette so our topic is be sensitive to the inner man and we just proceed as influence influence be sensitive to the inner man how can we assume abyss be sensitive to the inner man that is the professor that if you want to be pro yes Bridget or free and read your Bible so free now you have a message so when he was here the message was the development in school but I really miss him all right so you can hear the message or read a message listen to tips and most of the Lord has blessed needs ministers pastors so you can also hear from the church Oscoda a.m. and half write a website so you've got tons of resources to hear from a man so that means you wish you can make maybe a year if you want to really whole Bible you can make it part of your program that you can even do it with in mind but let's say your schedule is try to go to video for pipe or stuff from Genesis to Revelation and you can put on part of your program right and read the Bible is gonna bless you if you want to read a message and we don't have time you can if you like if you're a reader read one paragraph you know check it when you get time read the next paragraph maybe we go to do my finish one book that's right if you are good in listening study team wherever you pick it from or youtube wave' a voice of God listens to it by bit right there's a lot of similar projects and once I don't know when he started recording it so much it's tons of them which are my interest you can go to the Holy Ghost we need you to listen to one sam or maybe wanna finish the same one the hoodie Shang where you finish keep on listening a lot of bring things to you so that is the widow of the Lord wanted to the wind a lot habits for us to be closer right because when you are interested in the things of God are you used to review more to you but then if you close the door on God you will need knock I don't know when you need when you leave you for things of the world which we needed yes we need him for houses right you for just name it I need this image even after that goodbye oh when we do maintain you come back Lord I mean I I need this I need money the Lord gives you goodbye you come back that is not that is not that is the way of the prodigal sons like we are not that be a man we are sons and daughters of God you know our position in Christ because the Lord has given us so much grease and yes implanted oh shoot his love that's right given his love we are expression of its love so we go beyond the average amen the Lord is wonderful Delores cumin now the brilliance forces and we know imparts we prophesy in part but but then when which is preference come all things that are imparts will be done away with right in other one revelation will become full in the time of for the Lord was but in a house right which house Jesus is the foundation of the house he's the Alpha and Omega Alpha means beginning Omega is the end right before the Alpha he was there he is I am amen and after the Omega he is till I am because it hasn't changed amen so Jesus was a foundation if you look at in the wealth parameter Jesus was a very fast addition when he came from Adam he was a foundation of the Old Testament and the New Testament Jesus for the foundation but any user in messengers to vote a house of God a pyramid ever was the first messenger as we know so when you started go to the house of course you've got a master plan but you don't know exactly how the house is going to be cause there may be some modifications and changes and in those messengers they were only God leave them to do their paths that they were all in to do so Paul wouldn't know what was good to be revealed at this time so their Lord could add on his hat the foundation to learn to lay the doctrines of the church Jesus Christ selling doctrines concerning all things they'll not give it to further Paul I was the Prophet most all of them to lead that masterpiece yes sir he knew that is this just a foundation there's good to be more so he said now we know in parts we see through glass dimly or darkly but one of which is perfect is come when the Lord Himself into the whole house and he chooses to review the whole thing I'm gonna see everything in one dimensional amen so the Lord put this in a savage messengers on to the day's the day of the seventh messenger which is Elijah the prophet William Branham amen in this time that was a Tom Kha chose to do every mystery the Bible and beyond beyond estate what happened in the Garden of Eden that's right what happened in heaven right what was the battle with Gingka Michael Michael is France what bad saw wasn't atomic bombs was it gasps all right battle of expression and never wanted to express himself like God but then God allowed him for the law of contrast so they're not allowed to draw into any Bible said one faith he still it's not like he's got a monkey's butt until in other ways it's influence drew and federal angels to him amen so that is the influence you great hands are praise be to God influence God give us influence what do you want your influence dude what do you want to do with your influence we come to that now let's sue in the book of as we read from Genesis I know the Bible said that he lived 365 years now when you come to mother Brahms message I want us to go through during the lesson really codes praise be to God let's read could hear the Lord is good but BrahMos will give another time another lifespan of most Moses sort of Moses alone which is not a system as the Bible says let's find out why the Lord he is good Olympic okay let's read a questions and answers let's read it through Ted friends then I'll come to you know so let's requests and asses if 1953 oh seven five three - oh seven to nine questions and answers on Genesis 563 the Lord is good it read and two thirds of the earth is in sin and more than that which to face of the Angels was kicked out right now from the Bible if you want to read it's one let's go there let's read it from the Bible praise me together let's read I think Matt Matthew 12 module 12 for if I had you're right Matthew 12 or will come out to the coats please I don't have it right give me one second okay les really good anyhow I'll come to the scriptures so we have a concede and 2/3 of the earth was in sin and more than that which two-thirds of the Angels was kicked out and those demonstrates come into people and habited their bodies see what I mean Jesus or there were demons now that was assisted and they come into people and give them a nature Jesus has seven of them out of Mary Magdalene pride both which is bigger pool you see unclean unclean filthy vulgarity emulation strife all these things then what spirit that was made up but when God began to make man of the of in his own image created those supernatural beings those stories para 65 and then he put man in the last of the earth which was the first man Adam and that man was made after the image his human his human man he is made after the image of an animal this human body is a bit above the video image of animals if you go further he is saying that a man who doesn't have the Holy Ghost baptism South America beef because to waste an animal animals don't worry excuse me to use their way but human be really amen that is that is what when a man doesn't have the Holy Ghost when the sprit those 2/3 of the demons that way comes from heaven who flew the devil when the influence man when they good going into man that's the nature that is their nature the only change to drink drugs strong music depression just naming all the spirits and diseases and evils and Deimos on earth is not coming from their physical earth it says spirit that habit it in the earth to manifest those niches on the flipside Jesus Christ has been a nature amen so when input is nature new what do you manifest you manifest Jesus Christ amen right so I wanted to I don't want to go to preach analyst lamb go into my code so this is what they're probably saying that those demons spirit who at once angels who were once part of course eternal program those demons back slate those demons with tempura demons so when there was a leadership position battle so ok citizenship or Lucifer my Danny wasn't consider it was Lucifer we don't like the leadership of Jesus Christ or Michael so now the branch themselves you know and followed sit and his influence and a lot cast them hours right and then they move into the edge and they entered into people the first person that ever entered was what king yeah you begin to sorta tell his brother people you could stand with his brother is revelation the way is what I was commissioned by the Lord you could have stopped stupid brother but then he said no I'm gonna kill my brother into the leadership so he killed his own brother and then to be a leadership so there was no no no there was no no able man and whenever in time to a person and the person become competitive person is not satisfied with what God has give it to them then they begin to fight and influence and break and divine gospel a man with habits and religious reps quality power ramps civil ramps police as the car rims in homes in families it's a demon it's a spirit that influenced me to do that man to destroy the family unit got a scripted and so if you allow yourself to be influenced that with those demons can inhabit you and destroy things amen praise be to God and you take let's see if you take a crystal you decid is a full of water River you through the crystal I wrong into the crystal it doesn't remain the same amen what one incident is that you do you might revenge but the influence is whatever rippling effects and so your action I'm not now they want to branch but your action everybody has what an influence even a child right a man take me please my baby is kicking an interest for the babies happy mothers can tell me better so if in the futures finished they will have influence when they are born as babies give much more influence right mother condense they will be pretty to sleep over there to see cooking at the kitchen and everything is what a much influenced by its mom oh my god amen so everyone has got an influence and you can't use your influence to do what you want me to branch but it's good the lot is good so let's go you know for a while and now we have a to the scripture the Holy Scriptures here whistlin did I read it already yes very and not leave 365 days Genesis that's what we read then the Prophet comes around and said I'll in only 500 years and I read for you good actually see them see praise me to get sure I think my pickup laughter would have been better I think I can use that if my office please no now help me better praise be to God so he dog leave 365 years according to the Scriptures and abiram sedan enough leave 500 years and he keep it kept making a statement before ministers to opinion and he kept making the system when this is we're hoping that's right and after this is we're open so now when we go if Lewis thank you so much jack government soon praise be to God praise be to God or can I dismiss it sometime the old type or the Oscar is better the rejecters hood becomes so the message to leadership 1965 65 4 / 7 / you have 281 leadership then there's other things that did is since then look at you know he walk with God for five hundred years and then he had a testimony that he pleased God God had verified it and said there's no need for you to die there's no need of you dying just come up home this afternoon and he went amen you know didn't die physically they have a funeral ceremony for him he just broke his body into the cosmos right and he just went a rock is gone just right in eternity but in the fasted I mentioned a man is generally do you have to cry around him but he just looked into the other dimension because we walk Academy please God Amen that was 65 now let's go to go she's good so now anak did not die physically and the Prophet said he lived 500 years but then when I read my mama was a TV 365 so what do I do and this as we can be a little stumbling block for us of our precious brothers and sisters some of these statements not only this but let's go into it and see the mind of God please be together okay making their way in nineteen fifty six fifty six oh three oh four making every paragraph 112 one one two it was you know who claimed that he walk with God for five hundred years and had a testimony he pleased God had faith that wouldn't see death he could help you God do it there wasn't even a jet plane in those days to get him off his feet but God provided a way and translation not to the end of and up from the earth to glory without receiving death day may 1960 him 1960 zero three one three the time you know before translation in a walk with God for what we got five hundred years another testimony that he pleased God and was a time of the rapture change they men so now here the Prophet consistently said Enoch walked with God five hundred years before the seals after the Sims during these sills and a lot didn't cry she didn't tell me was wrong he preached it to leadership and one of the last message therefore he went to glory Wow but then when I take my Bible my King James whatever machine you take the Bible said Enoch walked with God you leave all these years it was his five years when he married a boy his friend's son and after that he lived 300 years so naive the Bible said in plain language he lived 365 years and a lot took him away so now where did this confliction you know where's this going on what's going on here right now if not before before Adam sorry live before Lord in the Western we have a because anti-alien before he not before no one I was no cloud there was no read from the sky they had water from the earth watering plants and who saw water there was nothing like great drops from Adam up to no one there was no rain drops right now in the West time we had rain drops the F was in setting position right now in the West and the earth was tilted before no one here now at the time of year is around 12:05 p.m. in Ghana is about five more hours or six more hours so probably about to 6 p.m. in Yuki I was as always yes 6 p.m. whilst we are almost in the morning over just in the afternoon they are already in the evening right probably so I'm about to go to sleep the hell is deepest because it's good Mandy if you go to Japan Japan Australia you go to a New Zealand you go to Philippines they are already into Monday it's already Monday busy working you go to China child child challenge affordances name shine shine induce bliss who I walk into wait going to wake right but then we are still in Sunday how come before no one it wasn't like that all the earth had the Sun at the same time and all the hard darkness at the same time but anti distraction the F was done at an angle we have latitude 23 hard agrees and longitude 23 and 63 a half so for Andrew so this portion of the ed get the Sun while this portion is in darkness right then the Sun the earth will rotate around the Sun and then this portion will get a light what this one's in in darkness that's right so this was not the same before before no one from Adam to know what the timing was different Sultan yeah on top of that in our time we have what you called the Julian calendar we have a blue current calendar yeah the way we measure time day and night is different and let me read something for you before we move on let's go to the message for rapture rapture 1965 65 12:05 the eruption paragraph 127 the night was ocular go back a little the Bible back just to get a background now listen closely the Bible was not divided the knife was not divided in hours in the Bible time so in the Bible time did he have 12 hours 12 hours here or 24 hours system that we have or the military time it in 18 hours military time or 24 hours the night was not divided into hours in above all time 1 it was divided into watches he's not talking about the clock here no it's not talking about there watched a series people meet it's not the wristwatch that your fanciful range what every war it's not itself for watching oh this is not what she's talking about let's go on it's another fast watch study from nine until 12 does offense which doesn't night so if you bring it to our time the first what is around 9 p.m. until 12 midnight that is the first watch in August and I used to Priuses an hour's right so they call it watches and they have a watchman in this time just like we have a military people I see we have a US intelligence report that I'm looking for al-qaeda people are trying to cause harm as you I am sleeping somebody saw the military watches all right cameras and binoculars and a telescope to see whether maybe what Russia is trying to do Russia is also so fine what is us trying to do that China is watching what is you isn't Russia trying to do so suffered of each other so the dishes are good Watchmen by the news time they had at our Weather Watch one will be on the tower this is the mousse so you can see it as a military person coming from let's say Miami you can call them men in West Palm Beach hey you got me I mean put on your belt let's go dance this reform is coming to take our women our wives and our our daughters we got to fight so we have a watchman who live in the towers yes they cool probably swamp them but there may be the towers and watch all around so the useful watches especially that night that is when enemies Envy right and the natural Chavez Fritz right and I turned us when they divorce we come if they take two joints watching me if I try to go get his pen is watching me but when you go to sleep I can sneak on here and just grab its pencil we are seeing and that's what the enemy does but when you are less spiritually when we are sensitive to the Holy Ghost the Holy Ghost that you know that enemies can you see him from afar destroy his influence and affect before he helps you Amen praise be to God so the Watchmen tonight watches the first hour is 9:00 to 12:00 this solid is the first watch the second watch started from 12:00 to 3:00 12:00 to 3:00 in the morning is our a.m. and the Third Watch was from the Third Watch of the night was counted from 3:00 to 6:00 right now we've got three three which is nine in profit number then we come up to the seven for the rapture which of tea please I believe between six and seven o'clock or six and a new cloth some morning for the travel OSHA sound on the bright and cloudless model when the dead in Christ shall rise and of the relationship what is chosen wash I gather to dia homes me on the sky when the rule is called colorful yonder I'll be there we all know who leave their outer portion babe but we want to look at out night watches if the lord help us something we look at their after portion so the heart three watches the first watch second watch from nine to twelve 12 to 3 3 to 6 that is their watches so they count yet they basically from sundown and sunrise in those time they didn't have the julian calendar the gregorian calendar that we have we have certain month and in ending 28 days 7 months and in 29 some 31 some 30 days they do have a stir like that they have flat 30 days they have a the sunrise that's the begin of the day so when the samples nowadays 6 out 6 p.m. our time or 7 p.m. or whenever the Sun Goes Down it's night that is the way they counted time amen because of our intellectual civilization actually the Julian calendar the Gregorian calendar was a poke at leepu x13 yeah gregory 1580 there about he brought that calendar of counting uses a 24-hour system so we shifted from what nature gave it to us from sunrise to sundown and if you want to read further they say they lose on this they are set in this we've got a juniors with a counterfeited the Julian calendar before they we have what we call the 8 anno domini unaccompanied is a Latin word means the e of our Lord right so they use it poverty or the birth of Jesus Christ to count time BC before Christ and AD after Christ so they use it so now when this Gregorian and the same can be changed the color from the natural we survive this in the time of a lot before the flood of no one when you bring it to our time is already been three to five this is different so being a prophet a lot reason into this the social dimension and this is as I mentioned and it bring the dimensional time and bring it to your time for us to understand amen we live a different era is different to God when I was in Texas I took a course in US history and before the professor started he also give us a briefing that this topic is very sensitive so yeah also kind of brief everybody to make sure that you could hear something now shock you subtle engines and humana understand so he said the ladies don't be judgmental because in those time women could even pawn properties they were about twenty years or whenever they can't no properties is that don't change them if you gentlemen they rise do they wanna change us because in that time women didn't wear shorts the dress line women the way for dress so if you are good in general now why can't a man for property you're gonna rise and tell you that why you ain't shows and the course was in summer when of course went so I know how people dress and she was talking about induced time they had what you call convention experience I said Wow they had a lot of things before we convert it and so forth so that is what people were looking out to get to the convention experience getting born again right so dispensation changes and when the specific changes just like in deepening in u.s. about 300 years time is different if you bring the people from let's say a prevalence time they'll get lost they'll be wondering what's going on here this is not America because America is that America we live in now in the Bible time the windy major night and day this is different from our measurement so we appropriate that's what God I so did my prophetic and came to dimension become the study look at your non-dimensional the local take him to the supernatural dimension and you can bring things the low show you things and go back and give it to a perfect amen so this shouldn't be an offense to us that why is the Bible saying that a not lived 365 years then William promised a nearly 500 years is the same thing amen just different disposition let's take another scripture now focus if you read Romans chapter 20 bit less really rumors 2019 Roma's 2019 oh sorry Matthew 28:19 I'm sorry Matthew 28:19 about baptism the LORD commanded that is despise disciples Peter and the rest of them that go into the world preach the gospel they now believe the gospel baptize them in the name of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy Spirit that is Matthew 28:19 is the word I came from the mouth of the Lord observe the law Jesus Christ now when you go to Acts chapter 2 verse 38 Peter seems to be disobedient because you want to do something contrary if you look at it in a cannot mine Vita went the day of Pentecost when able to skim Peter said men and brethren repent and be baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ Hey a lot of between denominations as well I'll take what the Lord Himself said what a lot selling what Peter said is not contradictory what Peter said is a fulfillment of what Jesus said what he said was a kind of prophecy he briefly spoke in parables remember I think I am Matthew 4:4 said the disciple as him alone why do you speak in parables to the people is that for them is not given to them to do the Kindle but for you is given to you so in the open he's speaking from what their problem is so I so I went to seat then when it comes in the closed chamber the disciples he produced power this lorry did and that's not what you mean by is so I went to see then he threw sudden cedar so we came to see somewhere the best what was it and he began to regard as the seed is the word of the Lord which is preached to some people they are hardened or fertilized so they don't have that there is receiver receiving entrance in the way so goes right in and it reflects or deflects there's nothing in them there's no few funny there's no there's no a sit of presentation yeah so there what has no place in there right so receive it with joy but it doesn't keep long did the job the lost Ellington's or friend them and let them know I'm not going to come to church anymore I didn't visit me so nobody comes church anymore what does that going to do a literal life it's not a good what does it got to do something really Athens offend you that you don't want to send a lot anymore right we are human beings I mean rupture that's one it is the other sometimes but it does is not that that is not even objective yeah this is the love of Christ right the British force on the planet I did a lot of physics they have a lot of forces that tick tick the satellite from here to - to the moon there are different forces but the greatest force is the force of love love is the greatest force on the planet that is the force that God used to create everything that we see here if Britain the earth all the solar system is the love of Christ you and I we got a love of Christ and if you let that love that force projects everything the sovereign risk of kinetic of everything praise be to God so now here in Matthew the Lord said repent good day go to the world preach the gospel did I will receive the gospel but as them in the name of the Father and of the son of the Holy Spirit what is the name but an idea Pentecost in Chapter 2 38 the name was revealed Jesus was a testament a testament is not reviewed on to the test is that died so when Jesus would be that test is that died then it was time to revealed the Covenant to review the Testament it just like if your father has made a war now when he dies you should inherit his house his house one dealer in Miami it's my kitchen I mean wherever you want to wear buy this in Georgia as long as your mother's alive it can be only in those properties this mic is good to you this one should go to her this one should go to this so what is our life you can't be you can't get it you have to wait for him to time right unless you want to kill your dad or your mom it happens in UK when you go to UK some time one department to visit the apparently police have to be there because this man or this one has got some old car which was all about half a billion a billion pound sterling and you still alive so before why you silly mean that's an eternal question your father why are so why are you still alive why don't you die I was the one you leave your house is depreciating the government will take part of it when you die so you better die so that we can get this money and share the money and Google divine life it happens so certain people determined they come up to me are parents so when they are going to visit at least will be there so that they don't owe many appearance because this one hold and they have certain houses in Britain they order the house the more expensive it is so this sounds but then they want you believe in the government money value you get they will not use some - they're gonna detach it from the house so the house is going to depreciate and this is the children want to want you to die so that it can get its money and will do whatever they want to go to no chilhood if another part you know that is that is a human nature right but we are Christ remain we love life material things are not everything so if you look at it from from the Bible yeah Tom oh the wind if I the time was different yes let's look at this look a couple of other things here just one second so I don't think anybody will offended when he read by the Browns message and read that he he speaks about a not living 500 years when the Bible said he lived 365 years in the same thing one is this on our system here at one time CA 365 as the Bible times the eye recording was different and our record was even didn't have any Juliana Gregorian calendar they had sunrise there were many farmers they go to find the defense of nature sundown they come back home cook for their family go to sleep say the Lord our time we divide the time into hours 12 hours 24 hours so our timing is not the same as what Enoch and Adam and Co use so our time is different prophet that's why God give prophet that's why God sent ministers to see here from heaven and give the message to his people amen praise be to God now let's go to an the Lord is good let's do the poor not even poor let's go to a where the Bible said one third of the Angels followed the devil now perhaps that are too thin where is it whoa thank you God bless you can you read that just have a basis for that revelation 12:4 messes with Matthew so let's go to rev 12:4 thank you and he still drew the third part of the stars the stars represent angels of heaven and it cast them to the earth and the dragon stood before the woman which was ready to be delivered for to devour her child as soon as it was born now so this what about we see now Abram was in that two third of the angels were swept by Satan now who do you follow so we see I'll go to the Bible my Bible [Music] but the one we were written by prophet right above joo joong-won was with through afflictions god as the prophet do known after not reveal it to them Jim thought that when you die that's it movie morning you don't have no memory you gone you can't see your wife and your children walking around you that was a revelation he had at that time he didn't know onto the pillow fight it will boost a lot a lot Kim is a Jew no no no you view I in Venezia you don't remember because you I need you my mind your mind is limited to Eternity yeah you Jew and your family were inattentive you for the punch of the wall when the sons and daughters of your chakra for joy you your wife and your children away in eternity und have boils you didn't have cancer they are about 18 to 22 years old back so it doesn't matter your three three sons and your seven sons and your three daughters who are passed away they are right here and a lot given a vision of his children and you say do this body is rotten in my flesh shall I see God what is the flesh in a few funny the truth Alicia tarisha body you see speaker amen so the prophet do not receive all the they don't know what to tell or reveal it to them so the other things that even in the Bible times the Lord has to kyrenia amen praise be to God so Eva Braun Helen doesn't that God has to be really to them they know if you take I'll come to one of them Moses and Elijah was and Elijah the prophet begin to preach that yes moe-san Elijah they said yeah ministry even up to when this is where open let's see if I can read you can read it for me praise be to God let's go to that the first seal 6303 1:8 6303 181 paragraph 124 he not time the bride you know not Wentworth went through tribulation through software they become drunk and died let's talk about Eleanor no I went through tribulation and drunk and diet but in a war before God for 500 years but that was not it one sake but to make my point on me but pretty far now really to you to me the point there was Bahrami a question that a how about Moses and Elijah and it's a well he did have the answer so he took them Salafi since the old I don't have the answer but the ability said the immediately so all so God will bring them back on earth to set their ministry again it'll only really to me I'll let you know over the years a lot me did reveal it to him so we get to now preach it differently than he before he before he preaches let's go to any future home future up city 408 or to future home of the heavenly bridegroom and Ed Lee bright para for seven form remember God took Elijah after the rapture and translated transported sorry translated trance transplanted him but among the people to take the police offer as a prophet among his people pretty strongly we do that and as kept him alive this 2500 years is to appear again it's a notice here is Moses from the dead waste Wendy's his grief can anyone find it really a book of Jude see Satan the Archangel is written with the Archangel sittin said thus the Lord with you disputing over the body of Moses and yet Peter James and John was standing there looking at him on Mount Transfiguration right there in the land where the mountain is released after all amen and he came to redeem it so now Moses and Elijah the way it's began Moses didn't die basically moisés body because in that time if you remember what is went to the mountain together together long before you could come back they were worshipping idols and taking the air rings from the ladies and they have made an idol and worship an idol right and a lot knew better hit know how the people behaved services they were the lot you see supernatural because it said Moses admit you cut to the performance right so Moses was got to the people right because God was hiding the Moses vinick's up to the people so if the Lord led him to have a funeral de gonna idolizing so Moses body was broken into pieces and there was no food right because that way is this grid it wasn't very angels Purina do you think angels cutouts his feet in the ground and Moses there and had a funeral and took offering know how do you bury him drop his body into the cosmos and move to the solution dimension amen and that is what believers is a streets before amen yeah it doesn't matter my body be there or not it doesn't matter my body drop in the ocean the few funny the true me the true you who be right on the pond on the other dimension it doesn't matter where these ghosts in the cosmos amen that is what God has to his people praise be to God so the Lord transported the law said the professor that God does not sin to profit at the same time it's a nice even contradictory to God's nature because every man has his own human nature the our human nature is not is same you don't need the same brick facade your nurses that eat you don't like the same colors like even your husband like even co-host Amano have the same opinion on certain things cause animilitia is different because the same thing is the same pricing you the same price but your human nature yeah but around was a lot of I think fourth but before was a lot of a thing shimmy so give me your admin love he might be on host who he might have a discovery my last was can library Gary so God hasn't sent to profit at the same time he uses one when it's finished is sending to glory and use the other so let's read and the evening messenger 65 sorry 63 0 1 1 6 even in messenger the evening messenger 8585 now God always uses a prophet a man if you use a bunch of man you get different ideas see each month to month never did he have to measure profits on earth at one time he takes one so da da da can take its place for another day another message he never has to he also have one at a time and in and Eve and the infinite God never changes his program you must always deal with what he started with that's the reason why we can have confidence we can have confidence in what he sees you cannot change if we serve a man on the basis of faith in God the next month you have to see the same way amen so God hasn't said to me a prophet let's read let's repair our hope is in God 51 or 99 there never was in any age sorry there never was in the age I need to be the Prophet on earth at one time the way my no there were many minor prophets but they were one major profit and another was a prophet also Elijah then when Elijah was taken off a portion at all portion of Elijah Elijah spirit Elijah spirit came upon Elijah so God doesn't use to make a profit at the same time all right do come in to meet a prophet one has to leave before one who began his ministry like Elijah Elijah Elijah where on earth at the same time but before Elijah was ruptured God asked him to anoint Elisha Elijah to take his place you know and no way on earth at the same time around sedan enough it was his premium further and establish you live long so he was watching his finger father-in-law he knew inside at the moment might be prefer that lives am on the scene so when the universe ruptured the Lord commissioned him and begin to preach his message because enough was typing the rapture and Noah was typing the tribulation so he run through his time we went run through how many years on the flat after the flood they came a preset so and as we read the Quran we knew from the back we got drunk you go host you know he hasn't ran to his level type in tribulation but he was a prophet of God how can you get drunk he's a man God use this room for different purposes the main points you enter your ministry in your family your choices things that you love God has embodied coated that in you amen and not didn't get drunk but his rig ran no one who was a prophet of God got drunk so God was happy we can entire uses their lives to type God use a Abraham's life to type v Ramos and I don't watch this one but God called you from his other worshipping and was faithful to God he made mistakes sure Abram elevenses even the night his wife because he was aware of his life but God also Japanese is fee he was using feet in Hebron Hampton time how kind of feeding Abraham his son Isaac was a type of what laughs if you assume in his novels embodiment of love right Isaac son Jacob Jacob means deceiver his life was about Greece to commit a bunch of mistakes the Muslim was immense but the Lord was using is his life to win an attitude of Greece of God praise be to God his son Joseph was a time of perfection and that is the four corners of the golden covenant of unconditional love it doesn't matter how messed up you are mr. Byam just love you he's by His grace amen so input one corner fifth in Abraham another wanna love in Isaac's another Hana Greece in Jihad and a fourth corner perfection in Joseph and intervention even a mistake no let me see he took the language father right because when they went before Pharaoh family were otherwise offense although they have fever before them and they didn't want their daughters to intermingle with them because they didn't have the God of Jacob with them so how are they going to do the situation the country they kidnap your non-believer you know he other one was giving you feedback so they have to find a way to get to get sets of the different beliefs so that be done in tamari so to Prophet Kim come on I did I know what this is Egyptians they don't like I think one of something's an abomination Shepherd so when you appear before him tell entire Shepherd and so when they came before him Jacob came before Pharaoh Pharaoh Pharaoh where there were two firms presume we did know God and one who know God the one in the world through SETI he was the one who knew God who a fever before this report so he said we are we are shadows Oh she'll be okay juicy forever you want to sell your that settle them so they want to go out of the please restarted ESET totally our wives and their children from getting intimate with the Egyptians who were not another cognate of circumcision amen just like a time that we might to Christ is the age these circumstances circumcise our heart if you might redenomination you get what you get amen so we married to Christ and live in Goshen yes there's confusion all around but God has given you a pastor who protects you amen Alice if we tell you that it's not you'll get no the way that he preaches you see the way and when you go back to the world wherever your vision your houses what about you do the wedding your heart will protect you from every situation right praise be to God blessed be the name of the Lord so say God never sent to prophet to media prophet so he sent one there could be a minor prophet in the time of Paul there was one Agabus the way Adamo not preferred a good use there was Simon the prophet one who baptized for they were men of God don't use and a prophet even Graham said that the ministers are the were the prophet of the age a man so go to the same streets on on the media prophet and shake among the faithful ministry to bless the body of Christ is one and it's called the Holy Ghost amen if you read about water bottles full of Elijah what is the sort of Elijah is it something outside of God it's a speciality of God just like we are medicine we have got doctors but now you want to have an eye problem if you go to your GP the general physician is good check you out okay I'm not a specialist in eye doctor so I'm gonna send it to the ophthalmologist right to check your eye to see what's good on your eye if you say a dental problem is going to send you to the dentist he's a doctor too that is a daughter but he specialized in what dentistry yeah of the mullet is optometrist is a doctor but he checks your eyes right he doesn't have nothing to do with your foot to him that's not his area yeah so he might not he might try to give you something but that's not gonna wait for you so today what we're put for put at risk what you got it podiatrist a good actress and good actors to check your foot for you so God has got you've got diabetes they've got practice specialty so God has got specialty this timber the sort of Elisha is part of God that brings and come to bear to bring judgment and different things but of Moses it's a part of God that itself wanted it to manifest in a certain way the way he wanted Hannah and let me read a little bit here praise me to God the Lord he is good let's look at in the time of Abraham he wanted to reach us m1 v of the trumpet he has prayed about it just like he preached that there's a vintage ages and even they blow back him to draw true this is Brooke you know how this is it happened he went to Arizona Commission to go to Arizona and that's what talk about influence I want us to learn something before I go further influence this had profit for the whole generation the whole egg it was some time the Lord would tell him some when is it Marilyn Monroe when she died before she was I think s led was a populist everyone thought she wanted suicide by but everyone said no they don't a lot said that she didn't she was trying to reach a telephone to call but I think I shall attacks on playa yeah what does my ramona's like the willy Abraham because their prophet God should certain things to him amen and they said it's producing you so now about life is not all about you and me you do have a problem yes I have a problem yes I sort of whenever your problem God want to use to bless other people convene your web police you could be near home you could be the past without Amy do you who it's you to prefer them to speak a word of wisdom in a situation now bless them amen I don't deviate so the Lord to barabra huh if you wanted to preach it is that everything he prayed about it when you went to Arena Arizona it was a prophetic love study the church you could have done whatever you wanted to but when when he was even looking for a change to take to put his family in to put his children to have a Sunday School God didn't call in to another church god inequality we are past a church in Arizona so it was even advice and that to somebody start a change that's where ministers for with the ministry amen if you can listen to the influence of the Holy Ghost if you can use our influence wisely don't know be chaos in the kingdom of God this Rida ministry man because of the object is three I'll stop here for a while so time god bless a group of people I'm not talking about here don't worry about God John Wesley in the nest and didn't even have internet he said my word I said that what I have treated good beyond the four corners of the building you know that dimensionally go to me take this away and could give it to somebody else and we are here we listened to John Wesley's messages songs Prisca so it's not about this change is that the body of Christ amen what you media can help you to advise somebody who might be going through that problem and this has been trend in our message not here I know you get a lot has blessed for a Jaken people hear that they live in peace ministers live in peace we go to a lot of places change is breaking this one will break until certain portion one faith one fourth and take it away and it is not a blessing to the body of Christ I bring pain a bring bitterness it doesn't bless the name of the Lord Amen right and we have got example Jesus Christ himself was here he used one structure of our lives that the Sun does not not love himself but what is a father do it like what do it the Sun right amen it doesn't do that because somebody's try to influence him about what what it was is leading him to do the older boys would only do to come and take a portion of a church and windstar another chest some way amen I'm not saying eyeball cannot lead you to start a ministry go down to a cellar ministry and it should be there with a lot of wattage you should be honest in your Minister your pasta will help you some time god bless them what do people then they change go they won't want to be a pasta why is where exactly the pasta I can't be a pasta so what do I do so I'm telling you first we not even come from you let me go back a little bit look at John the Baptist how I said was can't hello Dias is the King Herod married his brother's wife right turn about these pretty kisses right well it was wrong right and they didn't like him especially rodia's that's right so when is why his daughter danced before Herod there was a feast and he please Sara said whatever you want I'll give it to you and the little girl said I don't know you want to tell it to mom or what do I want thank you promise that whatever you want go to the king that you want the head of John the Baptist so he went to the king and this is Proclamation before lesson president said I want a head of John the Baptist on on a plate goodness of life what do you want for the kids where has gone forth he couldn't take it back so he said there's a Krishna's to go to the jail take off John's head on a plate what I enjoyed about his head this is usually didn't come from the King directly but it came from their wife the wife is the change sometimes an influence doesn't come from this Israeli Ministry or our brother you could be a wife is in change somebody can have an idea why does you a minister why that why don't you also start a change why don't you do this and the influence will kick in you and you will see it okay you know what an awkward influence on this sister I'm connected with this right I'm connected with this Minister kinetic this person okay boom let's take 1/4 or to take whatever power so lesbian study testimony they've already seen what have you done the who you have been sealed if they actually said I've been saved so if you take a portion and we start at church next door what have you done we only achieve your last this is in Africa if I'm speaking African and in a language that Sonia Mia show us our fortune in our show voice of Madinah Oh Bravo we've got doesn't make you a king and you make yourself a king you go down so don't make yourself let God do it in this way amen so if you need somebody that people my mind okay I'm not talking about here but if therefore that the influence for true certain things so why don't you do this why don't you do this matter be the offense the influence that time will come you be the influence and you pick a bastard against somebody against your minister Gates or brother or sister a hole in family and they bring negatives amen I'll stay here for a while when I was coming up in a started a 1999 93 95 that's when I think my brother was a believer do but I didn't know the message when I finished high school said I'm gonna read this passage book I pick it at the other Sunday wait I put it down you re for a romance book the grams book on the street but then when the Lord Himself tell with my heart 1996 that's when the he'll reveal himself personally I begin to the Lord took me

appeared in the light and the West that is put there eleven years later when I walked into a meeting this little woman rose and spoken to us and interpreted it was word for word the same thing that the angel said they enjoyed a lot appeared to Abraham and this one was not a it's programming an angel now run went to Shefford Louisiana in a meeting and this woman spoke up through Tom speaking word for word what exactly what the angel of the Lord spoke to him right surrounded influence when I sign her heart to the Lord this is not a preacher she's a woman right it was word for word is it a lie at suport that we have in the life Tabernacle the Holy Spirit move on that one and said word for word what he said up there on the hill then they still begin to move and give it petition for telling fenced by the revelation by prophecy the things that would happen in the meetings the following night and not one time did it feel before that a little man stood up in the meeting about this human come over there not knowing what we what she do what she do she could do and she was standing in the mists of the meeting and the Holy Ghost well it's pretty fell on her and she began she begin to speak with tongues about this woman from the First Baptist Church of Shreveport and then she didn't know what she didn't know she didn't know what she said she had yes she did and then we force you to say anything the Holies will give the interpretation that said that says the Lord would implement the Vedas of Moses Elijah and Christ ministering in this tabernacle of Moses Elijah Elijah and Christ

quick who just touched that and it just made so much sense it's very early here as to why that would be said that when you look at it from the calendar that we have we've actually added taste to our calendar you know years and everything has been added to it because it used to be at the time there was only 30 days a man up to every month but we've added a 31st day and sometimes that then taking a day away in February and you know and sometimes February I end up with 28 days until the leap year to get 29 days and you know and we don't add it so many other things our calendar that it has messed up the ears right and we forgot about that so when a prophet when a prophet says 500 years and the reason all this spirit does not correct him if because God already knows this calendar system we got us all the messed up oh my church I tell you what I am so grateful for amen revelation in this hour you know we have Revelation the gates of Hell will not prevail against that so we thank God man we
