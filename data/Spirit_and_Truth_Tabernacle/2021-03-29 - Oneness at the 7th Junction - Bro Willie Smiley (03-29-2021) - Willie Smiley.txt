to as i'm preparing for that one to say it's good to be back home i've been away for two seconds when he was the lord and uh there used to be a time in ministry where uh i i just i couldn't go away for two sundays i just couldn't do it i had to get back and a lot of modifying plans but this time when things just kind of worked out um the minister's meeting that i went to a couple weeks ago we had a really wonderful time there in uh in south carolina brother uh charles anderson's and um you know we have service day after the minister's meeting then last week it's been a year pretty much in the making that we were trying to get with um literal life church there brother paul lafontaine had invited us and during the covet we just couldn't go so we finally you know rearranged the time that we could go and went last week and they had a wonderful worship they call it a night of worship it was their third um third night of worship and they just invited you know different guests to come and uh myself and sister rebecca were asked to sing and amen and brother michael belch and i believe and not sure who else uh but but we had a wonderful time and just just just worship and i got some ideas floating through my head uh after experiencing something like that and you know i i i'm i'm just thinking about some things so i can't wait for our new church and uh new school and amen and you know just praise god [Applause] i'm i'm looking forward to to doing some things you know you know when we get to the other side there will be no more sermons preached you're going to hear all your sermons on this side and when we get there we're just going to join the worship success song that they're playing right now it's it's not just words or song back in my thing we used to listen to it oh man hawkins man they did real good with that but when you really get uh into what they're saying right a wonderful change [Music] has come over peace and see if you don't have a testimony then it's hard for you to sing a song like that but when you know where god has brought you from right you can't help but saying a wonderful change has come over me and change my wall change my tongue change the way i think you change the way i act and react he's changed man i used to be ready to fight now i'm ready to pray see it's a wonderful change hallelujah good god almighty but uh we you know we had a wonderful wonderful fellowship there in the last sunday i preached twice there with brother paul and and um you know the church and we just had a the lord just blessed the service there and it's just good to get back a little cold up there and uh but it's good to get back here to south florida and just looking forward to what god has in store for us over these next couple weeks so let me just give the announcements and then we have a couple other things that we want to get to before we uh get into the word uh want to wish our sister keisha uh a happy birthday man of tomorrow praise the lord amen uh also sister uh gabrielle sister gabby she'll be celebrating the birthday on wednesday the 31st so happy birthday to sister gabby thank you for that thank god for giving them another year uh also don't forget this wednesday there will be no service amen on this wednesday uh we'll be coming for some special services but easter will start on thursday which will be april 1st that'll happen at 7 30 p.m then friday night would come 7 30 p.m then saturday night we come at 7 00 p.m we start a little earlier on saturday night and then on sunday morning we have two services one is a sunrise service at 7 00 a.m and then sunday at 10 30. and um you'll notice that i don't i don't really announce who's speaking when just come on the expectation that's that's the way i like to do things right just come on expectation you just never know what might happen uh so uh but we're gonna use the gifts that god has given us here in this church as i was saying earlier this time i couldn't take two weeks off but now god is blessed and uh you know and and as i get a little old i ain't gotta put that much wear and tear on my body because we got help we got help amen [Applause] and uh we certainly appreciate brother clicking on last sunday amen appreciate the word of the lord and there was a word of wisdom that he given in his sermon there just you know for parenting and and just just sowing into the children's lives and you know there's a uh um it's talking about how just get with the children individually right you know don't don't bring them together because they're gonna assume that you're talking to the other no you got my undivided attention and i'm giving you this and i tell you uh that was a real good word of wisdom i think if parents would just kind of take that and apply it we'll see a difference uh i was told that you know in the um uh the israeli culture they speak into their kids lives at very young ages you're gonna be a doctor you're gonna be a doctor before they even understand what the word doctor means you're gonna be an engineer you're gonna be you're gonna be a scientist you're gonna they just speak these things over their children and when they come to adulthood they manifest what was spoken over there right so so sometimes give them to the side of the speak positive in their life and just watch what god does with the seeds that you plant because your words are seeds your words are seeds right so i was appreciative of the word of god amen as it came from our brother and amen this i just just thank god for the help that we have around here amen so we're going to be using all these gifts next week and just looking for god just to bless us uh before we get started with those services we're doing something that we've uh never done before this is our first time ever doing it but we are we have invited those that and believe that god has given them a gift in the life amen uh we invite you to come to the service on tuesday night and on tuesday night it would be a service where we terry it just means we wait on the lord uh see brother branham taught us that uh we don't necessarily have to tarry for the holy ghost anymore we don't have to wait for the holy ghost anymore he's here to be given to us anytime we enter in we can get the holy ghost right well he says but uh but but but sometimes when it comes to the gifts just tarry wait on the lord wait for the lord to speak to you he said there's a certain way he would he just kind of laid out things in church order so that's the way we want to do it just the way the prophet said we're not going to try to make nothing happen but just less come and let's wait on the lord and i tell you this uh your gift has to be surrendered to order it has to be surrendered to order right there's a certain way things got to be done the prophet gave us that so now we're surrendering all that gifts to order uh and and and it's all gifts i got some gifts of discernment right i got some gifts of people that speak in tongues i got gifts of interpretation in the church amen i got gifts where people see visions right all these gifts are in the church but what happens it has to kind of pass through a the discernment filter to be proven hallelujah right that's why we surrender that's why we come together we submit ourselves one another and just let the lord speak amen that would keep the church so you know on this on on the right in the right balance because what happens sometimes people get a dream they just take off with a dream no interpretation of the dream at all just go god show me this how you know that was god right exactly how you know that was god right it could have been the devil right amen that's why you got somebody with discernment said no wait a minute wait a minute wait a minute hallelujah so it just got to be submitted and we're going to do this amen for the first time on uh on tuesday night so we're looking forward to that and i just trust that as we're entering into this easter season uh that god will just meet us in a very special way amen we're at a junction and we're looking for the supernatural degree to be made manifest in our midst at the junction amen all right uh for our giving those that are inside the sanctuary you have the option of giving uh it's a box a wooden box on the table as you're leaving the sanctuary just put your offering in there if you desire to give online uh there are two ways we can uh through paypal or through cash app if you use cash app our uh um i guess our handle is dollar sign spirit of drift that's for cash app and if you want to use paypal just use the option of give to a family member friend and use the email address of giving john423.org if you want to use paypal if you uh want to just mail something in and and by the grace of god there's been some mail you know uh offers to the church and i want to say thank you so much uh for this millionaire offerings and we really appreciated those that are joining us online they mail me tithing and offering into the church and we're grateful for it but if you do desire to do that the address is at the bottom of the screen there and that is our address for now we are certainly on the expectation that that will change uh soon and i'll be giving y'all a new address permanent address hallelujah hallelujah amen so we thank god for all things so let's pray amen over our giving at this time dear god we thank you uh for the privilege and the opportunity we have to give you've blessed us abundantly and uh lord you continue to meet our needs over and over again we could never repay you uh for your goodness we trust oh god that you would just continue to get all the glory uh from uh what happens here at spirit of truth tabernacle bless your people physically bless them spiritually bless them financially bless them emotionally god bless the people whatever way they need it and that's that you move upon each and every need god is our prayer so jesus name we ask it amen amen amen praise the lord um i want to read a scripture um out of the book of luke amen uh we have this morning a baby dedication uh that we're gonna do and then we want to read from the book of luke and i want to thank god for brother and sister being here amen [Applause] i i want to call a rachel every time it's rachelle i want to get that right amen we have to see her too a man her daughter and uh also sister quinna is in the house we thank god for her amen uh being here today and also i see uh brother tonight god bless you amen your precious wife amen good to have you all in service hope today amen so uh we're going to be dedicating a man um brother simba and sister ruth has been blessed with a little one and we're going to dedicate this little one to the lord this morning so i want to read a scripture then i also want to read a quote amen uh on this here in luke chapter 18 verse 15 and they brought unto him also infants that he would touch them but when his disciples saw it they rebuked them amen but jesus called them unto him and said suffer little children to come unto me and forbid them not so don't stop the kids from being dedicated uh for such is the kingdom of god uh verily i say unto you whosoever shall not receive the kingdom of god as a little child shall in no wise enter therein in this quote out of the message paradox uh brother branham just makes a statement here about dedication that i just wanted to read to you all amen this morning and we thank god [Music] that we have the opportunity to dedicate the little ones to jesus uh there's a uh here he says we don't believe in uh baptizing and then inform those little babies because they have no sin so we don't baptize children that's a kind of catholic thing i remember a friend of mine telling me uh you know i don't think that fellow went to church no time but when he had a child he took it to the church to get baptized and according to the catholic tradition once the child's been baptized they could they automatically go into heaven uh that's not according to scripture that's just according to the catholic church teaching but uh in order to go to heaven you got to be born again that's what jesus said you must be born again so uh but uh but we so we don't that we don't baptize little children we only baptize them when they come to the age of accountability they understand uh what sin is all about when they haven't understand that then we'll take them in the water we'll baptize them uh so here he says we don't believe in baptizing any form those little babies because they have no sin they are born in sin shaped and iniquity comes to the world speaking lives but they have nothing to repentance of it says in baptism is unto repentance and remission of sin so the baby has nothing to repent for when jesus died on the cross he cleansed all sin and now when we get old enough to know that we got to repent for what we did then we are and recognize that christ would die for us that little baby can't recognize that that christ died for him but when we are old enough to recognize that christ died for us and then we are baptized unto this unto his death raised his resurrection will the next sunday i get on that lord if god willing it says now therefore we bring them and dedicate them so we don't baptize them but we bring them and dedicate them he says any mothers any church any creed any color anything else we dedicate all the children to the lord jesus christ and you know and this is a quote that really helped me um um just in just the way i was just seeing some things and i thank god for the word and thank god for his prophet uh but when he said we dedicate all any everything that's what we're going to do dedicate any any mother got a baby we got that we'll dedicate praise the lord any mother got a baby will dedicate what i what i like to do though before dedication just have a little conversation amen with the parents uh and uh and everything but uh but we we certainly will dedicate amen to babies so i'm gonna let um this morning we got um uh brother simba and sister ruth we're going to invite sister gwinner to come as well they're going to bring the baby but i also want to say on next sunday i have another dedication of a baby that's going to happen and if there's anybody that would like to uh have their baby dedicated also on next sunday which is easter sunday just uh get in touch with me and let's talk about and let's make sure that we prepare uh for that to me dedication is not just uh some cute event that we do amen it's a commitment from the parents that they're going to raise their children in godly weeds right it's a commitment you're bringing the child to jesus right so this is a commitment i am going to raise this child and god in the ways amen i'm going to teach them the word of god i'm going to bring them into the house of god i don't want to just bring them to the dedication that we don't see the child no more i'm gonna bring them to the house of god so they can be fed the word of god they can be taught the word of god i want to bring my child to the lord jesus amen amen so let's have brother simba sister ruth and sister winner they will come this time and we will have a word of prayer amen over mason amen [Music] oh bring them in oh bring them in they bring the little ones to jesus you can get whatever shot you want to get all right feel free to do that we got brother mason oh my god and mason funashe thank god for him and we thank god for his father and his mother thank god for the grandmother this is his uncle over here amen we thank god for them uh and i i feel if um conditions were different maybe we would have had brother buena here to be a part of this but we give our greetings to brother gwynna we congratulate him on his first grandchild amen and we want to pray over mason today shall with our heads father in the name of jesus little mason has been brought to you today and you have given them to his parents now the parents are bringing them back to you god we dedicate mason for your glory for your honor we act so god that you would give the parents strength and wisdom how to raise this child that they would commit lord to raise him in the ways of god that he would grow up lord with a heart to want to serve you lord we uh we give them back to you at a very early age before certain satan can do anything of god we give them back to you that you would just uh lord let your spirit rest rule and abide father that he would have a heart lord that was so sensitive to the spirit of god lord if uh if you delay your coming that this would be a young man that will be raised up father in the ministry maybe follow in the footsteps of his grandfather lord that lies will be changed through lord the life of service that he would give we pray father that you would just anoint him and anoint the parents the grandparents and lord with the midst and his pandemic and their their desire to be able to come and see the grandchild lord open up doors they can't see and provide in ways that go beyond their expectations oh god that the families would be able to travel even lord brother simba's family back home in zimbabwe look upon his father and mother lord and i know that they would love to be here for this event oh god but you know all about it we pray your blessings upon them father we bring your blessings upon mason even right now we thank you for this child that you've given us this couple when you use them for your glory in jesus name we pray amen amen [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] reactions [Music] them in oh bring the little ones to jesus [Music] amen let's give the lord another hand of grace amen how many just love the lord jesus amen amen you know there was a um testimony that was given to me this week and his sister had been seeking for the baptism of the holy ghost and and brother trevor was at a church he was preaching and he said when he preached his sermons it just seemed like nobody got nothing out of it like maybe i missed it lord tonight i don't know what happened so he said he just went home and you know and just had a few mind battles but the next morning he got up and he had breakfast with a family and the family began to talk so you know on the way home last night from church we were talking about the sermon and it says uh the brothers say you know my sister had been seeking the holy ghost and and um just something the sermon said you know we we took that methodology just stop seeking and start thinking right and he said he said he told us just start thanking god he made you a promise that if you were baptized the name lord jesus that he would fill you with the holy ghost of promises unto you and your children those that are far from his ministry you say just start thanking god for it start thanking god for it so the sort of young lady in the backseat of the god lord i thank you for the holy ghost lord i thank you for the holy ghost just start just worshiping before you know the presence of the lord swept through that car and the god fill that young lady with the holy ghost right there hallelujah and you know a revival started because people uh the welsh revival started because somebody was willing to open their mouth to just say thank you lords right they were very quiet and stoic group but one person is opening their mouth young ladies say thank you lord jesus looked at him like what you said i said thank you lord jesus and as she began to worship others began to worship and a revival broke out amen i want to encourage us let's just worship the lord with thanks and praise and adoration and glory he's been too good for us to be quiet hallelujah hallelujah thank you jesus come on let's stand to our feet and let's sing it as brother smiley comes to the pulpit when i think about the lord when i think about the lord and how he saved me how he raised me how he filled me with the holy ghost [Music] oh [Applause] [Music] [Music] is [Music] hallelujah [Music] it makes me [Applause] hallelujah gracious father we just thank you this morning for another opportunity to be in the service of the living god this morning lord we just thank you oh god for just all things and just the testimony lord god just you know brother browner made a slave he said when that last predestinated seed comes in and finds his place lord then we'll go and uh we we don't know one of these days that last predestination is gonna come in and find this position lord god and we'll get out of here lord god jesus said all of the father give us to come and uh not wanna be lost so lord god we just we just thank you lord jesus this morning we pray that lord you pull out the spirit of revelation upon your people father help us the lord move the human part to one side that the gift of god could operate lord be freely uh yielded to you this morning lord we have a few things on our heart lord but it takes you to help us to uh express it i learned it man i don't have much uh in a way of education but i've seen you over the last few years just use the gift lord jesus and uh so we're just trusting in you and when it's all said and done lord god we could leave knowing that lord god you've been in control you said what you desired to be said and we give you praise glory for jesus name [Applause] we're in the service of the living god this morning and y'all y'all pray for me i feel nervous this morning amen i tell you it's a little it's a little bit different for me y'all know uh we've we've had some change we're gonna look at a couple of pages of scriptures genesis chapter one amen uh so y'all just kind of i feel like a guest minister this boy you know you go places sometimes and you preach and you get up and you just kind of feel a little nervous well i feel kind of like a gas i'm not a guest i've preached here many many times over the years and uh i'm a part of the group now but i just i just kind of got a nervous feeling this which is a good thing it's always a good thing to feel nervous amen but uh we just trust that the lord will settle us in the holy spirit uh genesis chapter one uh we want to read um uh from the 26th verse it says and god said let us make man in our image after our likeness and let them have dominion over the fish of the sea and over the fowls of the air and over the cattle and over all the earth and over every creeping thing that creepeth upon the earth so god created man in his own image in the image of god creating him man and female created heat them now let us look in the book of uh saint john chapter 17. what should be seated maybe we'll start at the fourth verse it says uh i have glorified thee on the earth i have finished the work which thou gave it for me to do and now oh father glorify me with with thine own self with the glory which i had with thee before the world was i have manifested thy name unto the men which thou giveth me out of the world thine they were and thou gaveth them me and they have kept thy word now they have known that all things whatsoever thou has given me of thee for i have given unto them the words which thou giveth me and they have received them and have known surely that i came out from thee and they have believed that thou didn't send me i pray for them i pray not for the world but for them which now has given me for they are thine and all mine are thine and thine are mine and i have glorified and i am glorified in them and now i am no more in the world but these are in the world i come to the holy father keep through thy own name uh those whom thou has given me that they may be one as we are one amen may the lord have a blessing to his words you may be seated uh we we like to use as a topic one is at the seventh junction and we know brother jack has been preaching on uh those junctions and i was telling him this morning in the office and i'm not i'm not going to kind of go that direction and maybe uh a few things to just help us to see where we are i appreciate brother keith that's that's my name for brother uh i i'm i'll jack his name up so that's my name for him so he'll know brother keith uh last on last sunday uh we preached you know i i anybody that knows me boy i will jack your name up if i can't pronounce it so i don't want to mess up with brother name but on last sunday he preached a dynamic message and i just thought that it just really it just really dovetailed with what's been on my heart for just a couple of a couple of weeks i'm kind of i got a lot of things that i decided to preach on i've been to ministers meetings and i've been listening to the brothers so uh i got a tablet full of things but uh this is the way we're gonna go this morning uh um the oneness at the seventh junction and like we say brother jackson has been uh preaching on uh the seventh junction so i wanna maybe start out here just for a moment so we will understand um what these things mean now if you know if you know anything about me you know i know a lot of ministers and i like to see people excited but one thing i've learned over the years excitement don't produce a whole lot because we ain't always excited i say this a lot if you know me i'll keep saying this the thing for me is that um when people start gravitating towards the word and the word becomes more real when you see people become more anchored and stabilized in the word of god that means more to me amen than anything we've been around the gospel for a long time i've seen a lot of people scream i've seen a lot of people holler i've seen people run around in church but when i look at things a lot of times it seems like we're more unsettled than we've ever been yeah you know i watch things i'm not saying this to be a small addict like i know it all but i i you know it kind of got a little bit of a gift and you see things and you realize that people aren't catching it yeah right right and and all i want for for a group of people is to get it is to catch it the problem makes a statement he said you're gonna understand right and for me you just want for us to understand because when people start getting understanding it it makes things a lot easy for all of us right right right right for the ministry sometimes you know we we say well that's all the pastor preaching that's not deep but that's right where you are i preach you something way up here and you're not up there right right you you gotta go to a place where uh it's just like a baby that baby that just got dedicated they're not going to get if they're smart parents i'm not going to be trying to feed that baby escape yeah right when he's still on milk or our own milk that was kind of a greedy baby my mother told me say man when i was a little fellow i cried all the time my grandmother said give that baby some cereal say that milk ain't doing it for that amen thank god for syria but but i had to gravitate towards that amen so i want to read us a couple of things to establish to show us where we are at this morning and then i just kind of uh y'all pray for me move us move us as as fast as i possibly can but uh uh we we want us to get he says uh give me a church ready visible to see the signs and to see them the omnipotent god the great power of god moving amongst the people which the rapture will be an easy thing when jesus comes they'll be caught up because they believe in sex aren't you glad you believe in the rapture amen um he says um because they believe in such he says sure we're at the end time right yes let's establish that where we are right we're not in the first age right we we in we're in the end time right right operating up under the eagle anointing this morning right now right we're not in we're not in the middle we're not in luke's age we're not in wesley's age we right we're not even in the pentecostal age come on right glory to god we're not in denomination come on we're not a denomination we're not in the pentecostal age we we thank god for uh uh uh god sending us a prophet amen right to elevate us because they had amen they had signs wonders and miracles and gifts and things of that nature but they still had so many things scripturally out of order right and then not only that the the revelation of the book wasn't even open right right they wasn't even in a real uh well when the revival started they were fine but after a while yeah and even when brother branham was on the scene he made a statement he said you know what that wasn't even in a real revival right right right glory to god but i just want to establish we're at the end we're at the end time right so we could we got to understand really what this means it means that you know we got to get down to business is that right amen glory to his wonderful name he said we're at the junction road the crossing time the ending of the dispensation the beginning of a new there's there's been six of those and we're on the seventh right right by the gentiles this is it right this is it right this seventh junction he said when we at the junction time this is the seventh junction right right hey man he said what next brother branham we're going into the millennium so so everything everything is is coming to a head now right people are wondering what's happening all right amen scripture is being fulfilled prophecy is being fulfilled right this is the day where the bible says i'm feeling them for fear we're not fearful is that right the devil can't take us to god get down with us man the bible is so full of promises you ought to wake up in the morning know all as well walk out your house sitting on his window all as well i have heard the message shalom in all his way chaos all around you but amen in the little world that you've created for yourself all this world when the world has been created by folks it's chaotic right because of what an amateur creator i've created a world that i'm living in that says all is well [Applause] see but watch this this is what i created for myself if you're gonna be miserable i ain't gonna be in that world with you i come to have justice i've created a world yes yes my understanding that i'm living it pray for glory god that's right in the end to this this world that's real then you got to want to be happy [Applause] you got to want to be peace if you want to be chock full of misery and all of that you cannot inherit you i'm not even allowing [Applause] [Applause] [Applause] yes [Music] glory to his wonderful name okay so uh he said uh the minimum that's right time will cease at this junction and eternity will begin for us amen he said the lord willing i want to speak on this tomorrow night the seventh junction and to try to bring your friends out it's pertaining to the coming of the lord so he says this is the time when time will cease it's the end time and it pertains to the coming of the lord all right so when brother jack get gets there we'll we'll kind of know this is it yes this this this is it this this for the gentile everything that's supposed to be taking place is taking place but i want to help us to understand amen what god has been doing yes sir glory to god something that that goes beyond just and as much as i enjoy you're not going to preach all the prosperity messages right but then you really won't understand what god is doing see the the message is a different focus for us has been a different focus but but let me let me get into this uh he says it's pertaining to the coming of the lord he said lord when i'm gonna speak uh uh uh i want to speak on what is the uh the unforgiving sin and and be sure to try to get folks here tomorrow uh he said that the lord coming is near at hand my subject is the seventh junction so so y'all with me so far yeah man this this is where we're at right and so we we want we want to get started this morning so that we could understand um what what god is doing one of the things we we've learned in studying is that redemption is is to bring back is that right you know uh i might um preached on these lines here before but one thing i've learned sometimes it take preaching the subject a hundred times before folks really even get it now i've been preaching over 27 years maybe and i'm still learning i'm still i'm still growing i'm still being inspired so if i say something that you've heard uh before don't don't don't worry about it right because it'll just everything makes sense you know there's a lot of sermons that have been preached over the last since january um since we've been here and you you've watched the inspiration brother paul right brother king brother troy brother jack and and if you it's something that god is trying to get over to you right god realizes this and i'm gonna say this and i hope this don't hurt to feel it god realize we're scattered all right man all right come on church we're scattered we're scattered in our thinking right come on church we're scattered in our amen but if you go back to the book of ephesians paul wants for amen the people to be established i believe brother jack wants for the church to be established that's why he's setting up these different things the terrorist services and all of these different types of things because the church the gifts are given to the church to keep the church clean right god placed these things in the church god never took these things yeah i'm gonna say this man gifts will cow for church i don't want to get in trouble let me let your brother jack get in trouble for now that's why i'm glad to be here i don't have to worry about getting in trouble right what gifts will tell the if if things is not operated according to scripture you know paul paul told them in the book of corinthians when they were speaking in times and that they was just wow we got to place these things in order he said because if an unalert person come in and see all y'all [Music] crazy he said he called him barbarians right he said ain't got people crazy up in there man me and brother troy oh i'll tell you all the story many many years ago me and brother troy we went to a spot you know we just like to get out and try to witness and stuff this way back in the day and and we just went to a place and i had my hand and brother on i think on the radio so it was close to the church we stopped there one day and man oh man that thing glory to god me and troy looking at each other and they just did things that were so contrary to the person's life [Applause] a propeller there because churches carry spirits people carry spirits that's right yeah glory to god i'm like boy i don't know what that's really about here brother troy yeah okay let me get that out of the way y'all pray for me my time is getting away but but we want for us to be settled right yes amen so uh we we're at the end time and and we we want to show and then i think the only way you can ever do this you've always got to go back to the beginning notice in in the way that the prophet of god taught he he always talk back to pentecost right or or he always look back to genesis and one of the things that even brother jack even i think he even struck this uh wednesday night um to show in christ the mystery of god revealed the three things that that god is doing right right and we just shut shouting and jumping we understand you gotta understand what god is doing right he's trying to reveal himself preeminence and he's trying to get us back see we're going somewhere we're transitioning we're not a people standing still well it just don't seem like nothing going on in the church you lying to me we can't be standing still and going somewhere at the same time either you standing still or you moving now [Applause] the church of the living gods has been always been on the move [Applause] i said church that's it don't never let nobody get in the pool pit say well there ain't nothing going on in the church don't seem like it's you it's your way of thinking versus the way that god does things god don't need your permission to do anything right god does his things according to his work now now let's look at the the book of genesis because what we find in the book of genesis is is god's first and perfect acts and one of the things we know when we look at the book of genesis we see god's thoughts perfect right perfect perfect thoughts expressed a word is a a a a thought expressed right and what god brought amen into existence was perfection when uh brother key was preaching last sunday brock understood on something but i was scared i might fall right he was talking about uh perfect perfect attributes right let me get it right i thought i had it wrote down somewhere a perfect eternal attribute perfecting our uh eternal attributes right yeah those things deal with perfection amen those things deal with god right see and so what we what we what we find in when we look in genesis we find something that's eternal eternal being we we find perfection right we find adam as our amateur god right this was before the fall come on that's right right this one's before you you you find um um a oneness right harmony these things is great to look at is that right you say well why are you doing this because i you gotta understand what god is doing in the midst of the spirit of true tabernacles what what all of brother jack labor is all about i'm just getting there right quick it's trying to produce a oneness in the midst of the body [Applause] right amen and and you you gotta because see if we if we're working with redemption yeah right yeah you gotta look back come on right come on oh yeah all right you you gotta take a look back at what was see uh uh what was has to be be taking place now unless we got to be understanding the work of redemption all right we're just dealing with good messages and things of that nature everybody trying to out preach everybody to be smart that ain't what we're working with we're trying we're trying to speak amen into the heart and lives of people where they can understand what's actually going on what's actually being taught is that right see glory to his wonderful name when you you you anytime you start talking about perfection you got to be able to look back right how do you go all the way back to to the beginning right all the way back to genesis is there you find amen uh eternal and perfect thoughts right is there right you really begin to understand what god what was in god's mind fatherhood all of these different things i mean we could go back brother battle said uh we can go back further than genesis 1-1 he takes us all the way back to what was in his mind what was in god's mind before one word was ever spoken you gotta make it shout out to think that i was an eternal thought hallelujah before [Applause] [Music] [Applause] when i was jacked up after the fool acted silly as a young person when i was acting silly you know on drugs and disobedient and and all of that i wouldn't listen to my mom lord oh glory to god i was in god's mind amen i was in god when he was on amen calvary i was in him and brought forth but we ain't going there this morning all right right come on now yeah come on thank god for that right but watch the oneness and the harmony was broken all right that's right all right it was broken because of disbelief i'm gonna bypass some stuff i got alright uh uh uh when eve disbelieved the word it broke the fellowship it broke the oneness it broke the the harmony i mean it it was it was it started the reason why we go through a lot of what we go through right i guess maybe we can we can't even blame it on eve now let's take that out cause even brother brother say we we can't really do it right because something has come into play to alter that right so so so when we start trying to look at the old man and all this man we need to stop now come on now why because we got perfect word perfect interpretation of the word of god so we can't blame eve anymore especially since the book has been open right and all the mysteries of god has been revealed then it starts to take away all of our excuses yours if i do i'm preaching to me too well let me tell you something i was born and i didn't have a dad oh my god oh my god boy my mama gave me this those are just things that you might have to work through but if if if you're redeemed you got a daddy if you've been redeemed under this open open word you have we have been given something to produce change something that takes away all of our excuse we got too many excuses in the church come on church we make two ministries well i did this because of this i'm witch i'm preaching to me too yeah this is fresh off the press but but we're feeding from an open book right amen an open book so so we got to take away all of the excuses thinking changed she thought could you imagine a person in that thinking thinking that their thinking supersedes the thinking and the thoughts of god this is where we're at today there ain't no difference that's right amen it's not no difference and what eve did he thought that boy boy look at him well i got something she did you had death yep you you you you brought something home that was going to bring about change because amen you had perfect interpretation of the word you were in perfect harmony you're in a in in a oneness right hey man catch him not not gonna say this could you imagine being married to a woman that you ain't never got the ogre hey but one person said oh my god we get nothing outside the church lord have mercy glory to god [Music] do y'all know what it's like to be in complete harmony well praise the lord that's good come on perfect oneness that's what it was in jesus name right perfect harmony no arguments nobody upset nobody turning over nobody not speaking i'm preaching to me i don't want y'all to think i'm preaching at you i've been married now 27 years old glory to god but could you imagine what it was right but i i i i don't want to leave you at what it was i want to show us what he is doing [Music] he said to be united not this was pulling this way and this one pulling that way no to be united he said now this is quite a subject and when i started i had i had my my perspective based upon what brother jack was preaching but then you know i like this this subject it just it just gets big right because even brother better he says this is quite a subject it deserves a lot more attention that i have able to give it and more than most any person on earth could be able to give but i would like to express to you my opinion of it with god's with uh uh god with us listen to one this message okay all right uh give us he said it's teaching doctrine and to the brethren who may hear this tape i i trust that it will not be offensive i trust this morning you know i'm never trying to be offensive right i used to have a label of being a heart preacher i'm not a heart preacher i'm a loving preacher praise the lord i love god's people amen i'm an emotional guy i'm a big guy i guess that's intimidating right but but i'm a loving guy he said but it will be uh but it will be the cause you to take this very considerably under consideration that you would study it prayerfully carefully and way uh way out in the balance of god's word amen that's good now now watch he says that now the the first man and the first woman in the goddamn eve now watch this there was i think look at his word perfect harmony perfect harmony with god see you say well why are you why are you bringing this as we go along you're going to see how important these statements actually are right right amen uh uh be because if you don't you're gonna constantly have chaos and no matter what brother jack do to try to bring a harmony without this revelation it's not gonna happen it's not gonna happen you can't wish it to happen that's right it's it's it's it's it's got to be the world that brings this to pass right glory to god amen the first man and the first woman that god he was in perfect harmony with god so much that god could come down at any time he decided to talk lift it in with adam and eve now we like to put that begot god can still come down and and talk with us right it's just our atmosphere glory to god glory to god um he said now that is he said now that is perfect oneness keep in mind now redemption we're telling you the redemption story if that was perfect oneness now what must it be to have this kind of oneness all right right today because we can have it yes sir imagine amen right right now i know we can yeah come on come on come on see see i i wrote down a statement i think i could find it based upon what brother key was talking about but but with without him in us there is nothing to to perfect eternal attributes we can preach all we want to y'all we still moving right we could talk about perfecting attributes but if he's not there there's nothing to perfect he can't perfect the old man y'all want to preach he cannot perfect the old man the old nature he's not trying to do that amen right so you understand amen what brother key was trying to get sure god is perfecting the god in us by the word don't talk to me see what we were dealing with and what he was dealing with amen is restoring a masterpiece that was a masterpiece that couldn't get no better than jesus glory to god see he brought in the four foundations last sunday right that's all right that's all right oh yeah come on see when that masterpiece failed brother brown said he wasn't willing to let that stay in ruin all right see amen god don't want us to be ruined to live to live the kind of lives that we live he said amen he quickly went to work to restore the masterpiece what god is doing this morning restoring the mass your peace amen oh glory he said uh now that is perfect oneness god watch this god in his creation god speaking leave the ear with adam and eve they were so perfectly in harmony with god amen till they were one with god lord have mercy that's brother that's that that's not skimmed milk that's not you so perfectly in oneness with god right right amen that's powerful that's that's powerful that's perfection that's perfection god in his people right amen right see they were so perfect in harmony with god can we say that this morning [Music] till they were one with god and his family was one right right yes sir right now keep in mind we're talking i'm reading this but keeping my redemption if that was this has to be right on this seventh junction come on now this has to be it's deeper than just coming to church it's deeper than just running around the building it's deeper than goosebumps it's deeper than just religion right which i'm about perfect harmony perfect oneness is that right glorious glory to god let me keep moving he said any man in his family a correct good noble obedient that's a what wow come on imma keep moving obedient family is one with another any family right and if there's somewhere in the family that moves them apart then it's not right the family's broken somewhere right right but if it's broken god can fix it [Applause] i like the old song say jesus we'll fix it for you [Applause] you pray let him have his way jesus [Applause] see if it remember keep in mind if it's broken hang on let it stay marked right roll into god the fellowship was broken i'm gonna skip over all of that that's at the back of these notes the fellowship was broken but god has been working to restore the masterpiece right amen listen this is what this is this is the thing that we got to keep in mind this is the thing that i look at when i'm studying the bible says he said i'm god and i don't change right if god stalks word perfection in the beginning right god starts to steal perfection no matter what we doing we can do a lot of silly things but god like boy that ain't my speaking right now see he said i'm god i don't change i don't have to get smart where was the council that when when i started all of this where who did i who did i confer with when when i even had to thought perfection right yes yes yes amen amen glory to god amen what counsel he didn't call brothers god saw it work don't say boy it's gonna be good huh and you know you might have them finicky kids too sometimes oh you put your feet up in here yeah i'm gonna tell you something we were gone boy brother diggs mama put both feets up in some dear ribs god no disney bro jack i've been eating deal a long time i live five minutes from brother cape they kept us with backstrap and all that well boy brother cables before she put her feet she must have had perfection and when she was cooking it for a baby y'all know what i'm talking about mama mama do special things for their children even when you don't even deserve it you'll be disrespectful in everything yeah [Applause] hallelujah feel good now i feel the preacher here amen okay okay so he says and if there's something in the family that moves him apart it's not right the family's broken somewhere watch this watch this they should all be one all right come on now i'ma say this we cannot get away from this statement right all right well i'm gonna i'm i'm i'ma say this before we get there the only thing that could produce this see there's got to be a oneness of of god or christ in us right that's the only thing that's gonna produce it watch this amen okay so he says they they should all be one father with mother mother with uh father children with parents parents would choose all in agreement and when you see that you see one lovely picture lord have mercy yes yes all right you know the fan family come on yellow come on now y'all haven't seen the fans they used to make them back in the day when i was coming up they should have been in the church yeah and they said that family you know the little daughter and the little son she got on my sunday best with a little hat on yeah y'all know what i'm talking about maybe the baby was on easter or something yeah you know the little boy he got on a little suit not dropped down baggage and chucks huh [Music] my sister-in-law tanya troy all the kids they come they're all in the same coats y'all know what i'm talking about [Applause] [Applause] he said he said that's god watch this watch this next statement right he said that's god's purpose oh yeah see and and his purpose as found supreme watch this was to be one with his family that's back in genesis right that's geniuses his thoughts don't change now he starts on god still wants to be one come on come on hey man um uh he says uh what's to be one with his family earthly family adam and eve and watch this and the only way that they could be one with the family or with god why this is big was because god's nature amen amen that's that's powerful yeah see it's got to be the attributes right amen to produce this kind of oneness i got the life of god in me come on this is what he said still y'all still with me see because god's nature was in them so that made them with god's nature in them then and with each other and god they become all one outside of that forget it forget it forget it forget it see how important the new birth is yes amen yeah right because nothing from nothing is nothing right god cannot perfect the flesh it's going to get its redemption by fire come my flesh just got to stay subjected to the word of god and the holy ghost that's in me that's it ain't no perfecting i don't care how good we look how you know y'all know me i like to dress up on sundays and everything god ain't trying to perfect no soup god is only trying to perfect that was conservative those attributes that's in it in you brother probably say the the holy ghost comes in us like the size of a button right look when you first get saved amen you feel like you you're in a losing battle things you feel like you came to overcome but you keep coming to church and feeding on the worst thing people do the worst thing people do is amen they run into problems amen and they stop coming to church yes you will never defeat the devil amen on your own the bible says you know what your inheritance is among them that are sanctified that's the thing that the devil want to do to get you cut off from the main body the main source so he can destroy you [Applause] but thank god for this i'm gonna give her something thank god for this jesus said all of the father give us will come come on sister i never lost one holy god that's my sister-in-law over there huh she sang the song he never lost one so so we went they backslid they doing this you looking at the wrong thing [Applause] see that's our problem we be looking at the wrong stuff creatures and now i'm gonna say this and hurt people feeling sometimes are the most immature folk it is [Applause] because a lot of times they be looking at amen the wrong stuff right they fail to realize this thank god it's still blood on the mercy preachers a lot of times preach bloodless mercy judgment judgment judgment judgment judgment judgment condemnation is that right instead of preaching the blood right instead of preaching grace grace grace grace to the head [Music] thank god grace come down come on church amen if if we'll start looking at amen the right thing and that's the word see if you look if you look at me and my mistakes and my failures and things of that nature are automatically you're gonna find fault but i'm gonna find fault in you if i keep looking at you you can get to hear me but i'll stand by and i'll dissect you especially because i got a gift come on come on but if i look at the word i cannot see perfection yes right why because it's god's stuff we're talking about the mind of god yeah sometimes you wonder what kind of mind folk really have yeah i mean i don't know trying to get somewhere but i'm trying to show us something church right right amen these ain't just good sermons you got to see the thing by the word what's that like that preach glory to his wonderful name okay um so he said so that made them with god's nature in them and with each other and god they become all one he's saying that a beautiful picture watch this god in his family father over all supreme no death no sorrow no headaches no nothing just joy unspeakable never to be sick never to have headaches just one with god what a picture because of watch this because the very nature of god was in these people right amen see you maybe we we got to chalk it up to uh immaturity right uh uh because because we we we we gotta grow um you you okay following the pastor we we gotta grow we we gotta mature because we realize the holy ghost comes in in us we gotta question whether or not folk really do have the baptism see nobody can't take away from me what god has done with me i still make mistakes but i don't i don't want to use those things as excuses no no i'm smiling no i'm smiling you got to be a first partaker all right you got to you got to grow up sometimes i look at myself be like lord help me yeah yeah i mean brother tilly used to say that all the time lord help me i see that in the scriptures sometimes i just talk to the lord help me i should be further up the road and where i am we all should be able to amen that's right all right we we're moving okay he says now jesus here and and we read st john 17. we we're almost all dead okay he said jesus prayed that the church and he would be one like he and the father were one right that church we as members of the body of christ would be one together not this one looking upside down [Music] when you start seeing that it's like boy we need to grow [Music] listen listen y'all can't beat me i can't be y'all i ain't trying to be you don't try to beat me cause you don't know what comes with trying to be me don't don't see me come in and stick up your nose he think he did you don't even know me let's get this on right here most of y'all really don't even know me y'all see me at church around church i don't even know me y'all heard maybe a few testimonies and i don't even know y'all right because most of y'all i see y'all in church time i don't know i don't have to live with you all right come on i ain't around you right yeah so why why do we do this why do we do these things [Music] we shouldn't with the nature of god in us the nature of god is supposed to be producing a oneness see this is jesus prayer that they be one oh yeah right amen remember we're dealing with redemption that's right right the first family the first church they were one they were in harmony they were in a oneness so much god could come down god could come down hallelujah no sickness no headache no pain no nothing god could come down yo let me tell you something if y'all really want to see god in our mix let's get all of this nonsense out of us [Applause] let's perfect these attributes come on now faith virtue knowledge temperance right let's let's let's grow up in god amen hallelujah i'm almost there y'all stay with see he says he would be one like he and the father were one that the church we as members of the body of christ would be one together just like he and the father are one and that day we would know that he was in the father right the father in him he and us that together we are one we were one right right right right what a union see it take a union to produce this right what a oneness that would be glory to seek god in his church to every member is just perfectly in harmony with each other in god y'all talking about perfection you talking about running devils amen look at the alpha church there was such a oneness when peter came when them cowards came out of the book of acts at the damn pentecost and then peter was was was preaching once was held up in a build and now they come out and everything else the preachers were trying to take the mic from one another let me tell you you can't tell it like i tell it peter all right the preachers the preachers stood up [Music] hey man peter preacher [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Applause] [Music] you say that's perfect harmony with each other in god that's a big statement right because you know the type of people we are we real spiritual and we like to be in perfect harmony with god oh glory i'm leaving y'all y'all know what i'm going down huh come on come on scared to see it [Applause] [Applause] we're missing what god is supposed to be doing in me and you yeah if listen if i can act funny concerning any saint of god i'm not a real problem and i need to be on the altar well you're a preacher we probably need a big church to bring half the preachers up in here all right cause it's so much funny acting like lord would you please hurry up and perfect those attributes see if we could get i'm gonna say this if we can get the preachers in line man we might might really have [Applause] nonsense it's like where you the people can sense that don't go to this with me you can't do this you can't go here you can't do that if i don't go y'all can't go that's nonsense that's nonsense how you gonna tell holy coast field people where to go what to do what to eat what to drive if you can drive a rose rush this morning i don't care just let me get in and ride [Applause] how much you can preach the message but if you funny acting you got all these spirits on you you ain't no better than nobody else one thing i do know your word is perfect and we're full of flaws that's why god is trying to perfect the attributes this morning god is trying to show us what he's doing in the midst of the bride see this scripture got to be fulfilled father when we become in harmony with one another china's only strongest as we can lead trying to get us lined up with the word of god get us lined up with the word of god we'll be really listen chuck we'll really begin to see some stuff listen listen watch the inspiration right right watch what god is doing that's right that's right listen brother browner makes the statement he said you know what your pastors are dying to lead you come on huh i understand that i passed it for almost 23 years i understand that brother jack is the pastor i ain't here to take the ball out of his hand i'm not here to support him right glory to god glory to god amen lord my prayer be lord how you using it how you inspired what's on his heart come on man amen i want i want to build on top of what he's building all right right i want to end like he was saying because the only way that i might help him and help y'all as a church i gotta be able to enter in to what he's feeling amen what his heart is how god is leading amen amen right amen god might inspire you to preach a different message that's fine that's not what i'm even saying right because i might eventually just change off of this it just depends but right now hey man i'm just just watching things watching the inspiration watching watching where this what's on his heart seeing what he's trying to do understanding setting the gifts in order things of that nature is that right yes listen i'm i'm about to breathe i'm gonna just take my time [Applause] y'all see watch watch what he's doing right right he said you know what i'm gonna have a terrorist service you know what don't go out of here and say well you know praise the lord they don't let the gifts that's a lie that's a lie that's a lie see we can't do it our way you gotta come god's provided away he's setting the door the door is open you just walked through the door and let him cultivate work with these things is that right and then we'll see these things be a blessing people get hot well you know that look amen and then they'll go out and take the story and the story be totally different y'all know what i'm talking about people leave church over foolishness listen you can't run a servant of god right oh my god amen you got to follow a god you cannot get ahead of a god you got to follow a guy let him lead you be like hey man this fellow took your son up there in the message of the guy and got him killed and boy scouts and all of that why they watching gods for one thing i'm here to follow the holy spirit amen and the sermon of god you've been the pastor i was a pastor i'm not a pastor now all right oh my god brother jack is the pastor like i told y'all y'all got a problem go to brother jack don't call me don't come to me don't call me all right praise the lord cause i will hurt your feelings smile right in your face and hurt you feeling did not tell you don't come to me go to brother jack all right y'all y'all we're clear so i don't want your feelings to get hurt be looking at me sideway look sideways up at you i told you i'm not here to take the ball i'm here to block yeah yeah my god people think i'm a bit i'm a football player well you must have played football no i wasn't this big i played basketball i'm i'm almost dead this this would be the last last quote and i think i i think i'll be done right you said if they were in perfect harmony with each other and god that's christ that jesus is coming for see let me back up so we understand if we're in the coming of the lord he said that's the church that jesus is coming for that's when his prayer will be answered that will be won right the the harmony right not chaos not this one over here this one over here this one over here sit still to let the holy ghost in the ministry build us up and point us amen to the change that's all that's so simple we complicate matters he says and watch this and i'ma close let the musicians make their way up he said and it is the only grounds of fellowship that god has ever laid down for himself and his church is the oneness of himself in the people right that's the only grounds of fellowship and the only way that you can have those grounds is by a union that's why i say apart from that forget it forget it if none of us get the get married to the revealed word forget it it's not going to happen see thank god for invisible humans thank god come on hey man he says that's the only ground of fellowship right the only ground the only way that you can have those grounds is by a union to be united with him forever just like when you united with your husband the wife to be united with her husband it is violent to death now then when you unite with god it's the same thing that the church united with christ it's unto death we part and then if you never sin and do anything wrong you'll be eternally united with god and the only death can take you away from god right not physical death but sin of death sin is dead the ways of standing still death y'all play with it [Music] amen that takes you away from god yes so to be united with him in the spirit of his power is eternal life amen amen look church you can no more died in god can die this morning you're eternally united with god oh i want to get to that after a bit united eternally with eternal god perfectly in harmony with him perfectly united together a church that all both god and his church is one united together praise god thank god you know what you got to thank god to be for being married to him this morning said right lord to his wonderful name listen in the simplest way i can right i i believe that we we got a good man here amen if we could just get people to submit to to authority that's right submit i don't believe brother j i've been knowing brother jack since i've been a christian that's been since 1988 right you won't find a better man amen than brother jack you won't i'm telling you

but we really you know back to our old days when we used to take trips together back in the day before any of us uh got married anything i mean just a real loving heart real caring to do anything for you i believe i believe that brother brown said this right he says he's ordained to lead you through amen right he's ordained to lead you through these brethren good preachers that they are they ain't

jesus your word then praise your god word give the glory honor hallelujah hallelujah thank you jesus amen we certainly appreciate the word of the lord on today uh precious brother smiley and oneness at the seventh junction and i tell you this is uh um just very timely and people and i just love the way god uses uh his different gifts uh how he just kind of piggy back right off of uh brother um kweku's sermon and keep calling brother key brother [Music] but uh brother quake who he uh he he blessed us amen last week and just kind of talking about those attributes got the afterwards you know there's things that god put inside of you before you were even born and these were things to bring glory and honor back to him right and as uh brother brother smiley just kind of piggy back right off of that thought and just you know it's got to be oneness if we would just submit ourselves to the word it's not submitting to brother jack but submitting to the word of god if we submit ourselves to the lord we're going to see god do great things in the midst of those people i watch god bless naturally right you know yesterday i dedicated a house amen to one of the saints here and i walked inside the house and said oh lord god you've been good lord and uh and i'm looking for some other dedication of some other houses i know god is already moving already i'm also looking for a dedication of our house i'm looking for that but those are natural things now we want to see god do some things spiritually and in order for him to do that we have to have a oneness we have to have a oneness and i just love the way brother smiley just was led to just kind of take that quote took about three paragraphs and just laid it out for us i said god you know how to speak to us he knows exactly how to speak so i appreciate the word of the lord amen on today god bless you brother smiley amen thank you for sharing your heart with us blessed be the name of the lord uh before we leave i just want to just quickly mention i need to just have a brief meeting with the with the church amen after service of just you you don't remind just remain seated i wanted to speak to you about two things real quick and then uh we'll we'll dismiss you for the day but uh just for the sakes of the church the visitors are certainly uh be dismissed when we said this mission prayer but the saints just remind remain seated just for a brief second so i can just mention two things to you uh also want to have prayer brother quentin mentioned to me that his neighbor uh i believe her name is barbara she's on the way to the hospital and um she was really trying not to go because a husband's in a state where he really needs her uh and uh but you know just a a trial has come amen upon this neighbor and we want to just remember barbara at this time of prayer that god would touch her god would touch her husband and just just guide them through the situation it's not even by accident that brother quentin became a neighbor of these people amen it's not by accident so uh it's good that we can take uh these things to the lord in prayer on behalf of those that uh our neighbors to us so we want to remember amen barbara in prayer let us bow our heads amen and prepare to close the service at this time and remember barbara and prayer father we thank you for uh all that you have done here today lord we just appreciate all the worship we appreciate the word of god that has been given to us and lord how we are strengthened and encouraged by what we have heard lord you're calling us to oneness when we see things in disarray and out of order god you don't want to leave it like that when you saw adam and eve uh kind of fall from the order that was in the garden a time when there was no heartache no pain no headaches no sickness no disease no pandemics nothing lord everything was so peaceful and harmony father that existed in the garden if that was the initial thought of mine god that is the eternal thought of your mind and that's exactly what you're looking for even in our midst so what we pray for unity not just in the body but unity in the homes uh unity husband and wife unity with the children lord may the spirit of god just bring this unity there some things we we we try to fix but we can't fix but father you have supernatural uh uh strength you're able to like the prophet say you're able to unravel or not so god somehow move on every situation the lord bring the unity the oneness god that you desire amen for us to have we want you to have the preeminence in our lives we want you to have the preeminence in our homes want you to have the preeminence in the church of god so we're trusting that you would get glory that it won't just be a sermon but it become a man of manifestation in all of our lives father we want to remember amen brother quentin's neighbor barbara father she's on the way to the hospital you know the condition you know everything she's going through and in between her condition and she is a patient we place the blood of the lord jesus christ believing that you were wounded for her transgressions bruised for her iniquities the chastisement of a peace is is upon you and with your stripes we're declaring healing for her her husband needs you god and father the family is in need right now and father many realize that if they just turn to you god they can have all their needs met so i ask that you move by your spirit upon her we also want to remember our precious sister waste and god who is preparing for a procedure on tomorrow go before her old god and lord everything just go perfectly fine and lord does she recover well and and father there'd be no issues that would come from it god we buy in the hands of the enemy that would try to come against her in any way and we lose your presence and your power lord to saturate her body make the difference like only you can god we committed now into your hands bless the saints amen that have come bless those that have gathered online we ask that you have just minister to each and every one and ever their respective ways prepare our hearts for this upcoming week oh god as we just
