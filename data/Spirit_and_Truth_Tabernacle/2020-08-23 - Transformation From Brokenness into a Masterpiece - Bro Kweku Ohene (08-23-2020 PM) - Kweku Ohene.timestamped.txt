[13:51] um just want to just mention so
[13:54] uh this this wednesday we'll still be
[13:57] doing
[13:57] amen our live stream on periscope and
[14:00] virtual service
[14:01] that we do on wednesday but come the
[14:04] first
[14:05] wednesday of september we
[14:08] are reopening the church for saints that
[14:11] want to come on wednesday nights
[14:12] we're going to still encourage that we
[14:14] do social distancing
[14:16] and and uh you know bring your mask and
[14:18] all those things amen i think that's
[14:20] still important as we
[14:22] we we reopen god has been good to us we
[14:25] have not had
[14:26] any outbreaks a man during this time
[14:28] we've been meeting ever since
[14:30] um the week before easter which would be
[14:33] um palm sunday uh the lord has been
[14:36] allowing us to
[14:37] to meet and uh just um you know
[14:40] actually before we do anything you know
[14:42] it's the according to
[14:44] the um the structure of the church the
[14:47] deacon assists the pastor
[14:49] in all the spiritual matters so uh often
[14:53] i mean
[14:53] every time before we actually do
[14:54] anything i have a conversation with
[14:56] brother troy as our deacon you know we
[14:58] we talk together just to kind of see
[15:00] okay what what's the next step so
[15:02] i appreciate amen having a deacon that i
[15:04] can go to and just kind of talk to and
[15:06] and uh and you know so we we agree on
[15:09] things
[15:09] amen before we actually do things right
[15:12] and uh so this this whole time and just
[15:15] just the direction that we've gone
[15:17] i believe god's been good to us amen in
[15:19] the midst of it and we thank god but
[15:21] we knew that the ultimate thing was not
[15:22] for us to remain
[15:24] divided amen at some point in time we
[15:26] would have to start working our way back
[15:28] together
[15:28] uh this is not going back to an old
[15:31] normal
[15:32] uh there is a new normal that we're all
[15:34] setting amen to
[15:36] this this this pandemic is something
[15:38] that i don't feel is just going to go
[15:40] away
[15:40] overnight amen we're going to be dealing
[15:42] with this for a while
[15:43] uh and i mean they don't really have a
[15:46] solution
[15:46] they don't have a solution i think we're
[15:48] looking for them to come up with one and
[15:50] and everybody you know got all kind of
[15:52] things but a lot of money being made
[15:53] with some of the solutions right
[15:55] and uh and i can't say i'm gonna be the
[15:57] first one to sign up for some things i'm
[15:59] gonna just have to wait i trust the word
[16:00] of god
[16:01] right uh but uh but you know but the
[16:03] thing is we still
[16:04] have to navigate during these times so
[16:07] we will be we'll be coming back amen
[16:10] uh on wednesday nights not this wins but
[16:12] the first wednesday of
[16:13] of the month of september we will start
[16:16] allowing everybody to come back into the
[16:17] house of lord those that can make it on
[16:19] wednesday nights
[16:20] on sundays amen starting next
[16:23] sunday amen we will no longer have a
[16:26] 9 a.m service and a 12 p.m service we
[16:29] will go back to our 10 30 service
[16:32] and everybody is welcome to attend amen
[16:35] the 10 30 service
[16:36] amen the church will be coming back
[16:38] together now
[16:40] uh in the midst of that though as we all
[16:43] come back together i want to
[16:45] stress the importance of
[16:48] all of us using our mass amen it's very
[16:52] important
[16:53] we don't want an outbreak amen so as we
[16:56] bring
[16:56] everybody back together i want to ask
[16:58] that let's all be very diligent about
[17:00] using our mass sometimes the mass a man
[17:03] is
[17:04] not just for you but it's to to to help
[17:06] protect others
[17:08] uh so and i know it's very uncomfortable
[17:10] i'm the first one that would say it's
[17:11] uncomfortable
[17:12] but try to find a mass that is
[17:14] comfortable as we come back
[17:16] i don't i just want us to do everything
[17:18] we can to prevent
[17:20] any outbreaks in our midst we're going
[17:22] to still be washing hands when we enter
[17:24] the sanctuary
[17:25] uh we check temperatures when we empty
[17:27] into the sanctuary
[17:28] and the other thing that'll happen is
[17:29] that uh the um
[17:32] uh the ushers and and brother troy
[17:34] deacon
[17:35] they're gonna make sure that people are
[17:36] sitting together as families amen we'll
[17:38] kind of put family units together we're
[17:40] still trying to keep
[17:41] uh six feet of distances so we'll have
[17:43] to maybe have the families kind of
[17:44] squeeze in so that we can get somebody
[17:47] else maybe on the road behind you
[17:48] a six foot distance apart but we got a
[17:51] little strategy that we're going to try
[17:52] to use to make sure that we keep
[17:53] the six foot distance there might be
[17:56] some people asked to use the front row
[17:58] somebody gonna have to sit on the front
[17:59] row i know that sometimes like oh
[18:01] that's too close to the pulpit but no
[18:03] we're gonna need somebody
[18:05] amen on the front row and and brother
[18:07] troy amen and he'll be working with the
[18:09] ushers
[18:10] they will set up who that is so the
[18:11] first thing i'm gonna ask everyone
[18:14] in this time of transition
[18:17] if the ushers or uh uh ask you to do
[18:20] something
[18:21] typically they're they're you know we've
[18:23] already talked about what we want
[18:24] everybody to do so
[18:25] if they ask you to do something i want
[18:27] you to take the chick-fil-a attitude
[18:30] my pleasure praise the lord they
[18:33] actually do something
[18:34] yes it's my pleasure we need to work
[18:37] through this together amen we need to
[18:41] work through this together so i know
[18:42] some of y'all got your
[18:43] favorite seats we may have to disrupt
[18:45] that for the time being
[18:47] in order to be able to bring everybody
[18:49] back together so please bear with us
[18:51] please work with us
[18:52] amen because uh i think it's going to be
[18:55] a real blessing
[18:56] god is on the other end of this and i
[18:58] think one of the things god got in store
[19:00] for us is a new church a new school and
[19:02] and as we go into that new church i want
[19:05] us
[19:06] all to be able to go together and
[19:08] rejoice together
[19:09] right now well nine o'clock service and
[19:11] twelve no no
[19:12] everybody together all of us been
[19:14] waiting on this time and
[19:16] and god following them did something for
[19:17] us and we're gonna rejoice together
[19:19] we're gonna shout together
[19:20] if we have to shout with a mass we'll
[19:22] shout with a mass praise the lord
[19:24] amen but uh but we we just we just want
[19:26] to try to bring everyone together
[19:28] and we want to do it slowly we want to
[19:30] do it uh in a way that
[19:32] everyone um uh is very comfortable and
[19:35] and so i'm just gonna ask and just
[19:37] reiterate everyone please
[19:39] be sensitive amen uh to what we're
[19:41] trying to do and
[19:42] and just take the my pleasure attitude
[19:44] amen we really appreciate that
[19:46] um outreach we started on um
[19:50] um last last week we we did our first
[19:54] outreach and i think we had about
[19:56] 24 boxes of food that we were able to
[19:57] give out and and this outreach has been
[19:59] shut down
[20:00] for uh quite some time and and uh so
[20:03] people didn't know that was reopened but
[20:04] when they saw us there different ones
[20:06] was coming and calling their friends and
[20:07] family members to come and get food
[20:09] uh but we we realized it's probably
[20:11] gonna grow it's gonna be a lot more
[20:12] people coming
[20:13] and uh you know i was very grateful for
[20:15] those that showed up and anybody else

[20:20] to sweat a little bit if you want to
[20:22] lose some weight come on to the outreach
[20:23] amen you're going to lose some weight
[20:25] amen but but it was a real wonderful
[20:27] opportunity we had to just uh just just
[20:29] just share
[20:30] food and as we as we get our cells
[20:33] in ingrained in that community is going
[20:36] to go from natural food to spiritual

[35:45] my message
[35:47] the lord knows everything amen praise be
[35:49] to god i want us to
[35:51] a friend of mine she was a co-worker in
[35:54] san antonio texas
[35:55] she's a very strong believer in the word
[35:57] of the lord her husband caught
[35:59] kobe 19. and she stood in she was so
[36:02] gallant
[36:03] praying even when the doctors were
[36:05] saying she was going to die
[36:06] she stood in for the husband but this
[36:08] morning 5 am the husband went to be with
[36:10] the lord and this ready happens to be
[36:13] the they have three daughters
[36:14] uh emerald crystal and diamond

[36:20] and that is really tough so i wonder if

[36:35] prayer man

[36:41] this family there god in texas i believe
[36:44] and
[36:46] god a husband has been called home and
[36:48] we realize
[36:50] that you don't make mistakes and the
[36:52] lord is
[36:53] yes it might be related to covet but we
[36:56] know that you have a perfect
[36:58] plan and god is very unfortunate from
[37:01] our standpoint we look at a father being
[37:04] called home
[37:05] on the day of his daughter's birthday
[37:08] lord howe that would certainly
[37:10] um be a challenge to the child as they
[37:13] go through the years but some
[37:14] how some way god bring victory
[37:18] through this situation give
[37:20] encouragement to this family
[37:23] give strength to them lord and
[37:26] we just ask that you would help them
[37:28] lord during this time that you
[37:30] you would turn their mourning into
[37:32] dancing
[37:33] we know heaven uh rejoices when a
[37:35] believer is coming home like that
[37:37] they're absent from the body but present
[37:39] with the lord
[37:40] and god the family we know that they'll
[37:42] feel the effects of this but god
[37:44] we just actually would carry them may
[37:46] this be that time in their life when
[37:48] they look down in the sands
[37:50] and they see one set of footprints but
[37:53] be reminded
[37:54] that this is also a time that you're
[37:56] carrying them
[37:57] and they're still making progress amen
[37:59] so father we just exit you would be with
[38:01] them
[38:01] comfort them strengthen them help them
[38:04] meet every need that they would have
[38:05] lord during this time and
[38:07] help the wife help the daughters lord
[38:09] just be with them god in the only way
[38:10] that you can we commit them
[38:12] into your capable hands fathers in jesus
[38:14] christ's name that we pray
[38:16] amen amen gloria bless you god bless you
[38:20] thank you amen praise be to god
[38:24] this morning we want to talk about
[38:27] from our brokenness into masterpiece
[38:31] amen how the lord tends our brokenness
[38:34] into masterpiece so if you want to title
[38:36] it we can put it transformation from
[38:38] brokenness into masterpiece i mean
[38:41] transforming from brokenness into
[38:44] masterpiece
[38:45] and i have a bunch of scriptures but i
[38:47] would like to
[38:48] read let's read it uh some
[38:52] if you don't mind let's take our bible
[38:55] and then read some 20
[38:59] 22 first
[39:03] there's a couple of scriptures from
[39:04] psalm 22.
[39:08] verse 1 and 2. some 22
[39:12] verse 1 and 2. david was
[39:15] prophesying but it was actually jesus
[39:18] christ
[39:19] speaking through david amen david was a
[39:22] prophet king
[39:23] and a prophet king and priest he had all
[39:26] the attributes and the lord used david
[39:28] in
[39:29] mighty different way and in psalm 22
[39:31] verse 1 and 2
[39:32] they will begin to cry my god my god
[39:36] why has thou forsaken me why are thou so
[39:39] far from helping me
[39:40] and from the worst of my rolling oh my
[39:43] god i cry in the daytime but thou
[39:45] hear us not and in the night season i'm
[39:48] not silent
[39:49] amen shall we be seated father we pray
[39:52] lord add blessing to the reading of your
[39:54] word in jesus christ's name
[39:55] amen so david was talking about
[39:59] crying unto the lord yes and a lot kind
[40:02] of as forsaking him
[40:04] and it was david was typing jesus christ
[40:07] coming to die the son of god the lamp of
[40:10] god coming to die for us
[40:11] in our broken estate and he was crying
[40:14] on the cross
[40:16] as we know that heaven rejected him the
[40:19] earth
[40:20] has had done with him the earth couldn't
[40:21] contain him anymore more
[40:23] and heaven couldn't accept him because
[40:25] he carried your sin
[40:26] and my sin right our burdens was laid
[40:29] upon him
[40:30] and so both heaven and earth rejected
[40:33] him he became a curse for us
[40:36] so that was forsaken psalm 22 was
[40:39] forsaken when he was approaching death
[40:41] forsaken to die
[40:43] when you read psalm 23 psalm 23
[40:46] is death itself burial and then
[40:50] let's see what where it leads to so we
[40:52] want to read a couple of scriptures from
[40:53] psalm 23
[40:55] i know it's our favorite song that we
[40:57] all have to read it
[40:58] but then if you read from uh let's start
[41:01] from verse one up to four somewhere
[41:03] psalm 23 verse one 2 4
[41:07] so the lord is my shepherd i shall not
[41:09] want
[41:10] he maketh me to lie down in green
[41:12] pastures he leadeth me beside the still
[41:14] waters
[41:15] he restore his story he restoreth my
[41:18] soul
[41:18] he leadeth me in the path of
[41:20] righteousness for his name's sake
[41:22] verse four is where i want us to take
[41:24] note it's a year though i walk through
[41:25] the valley of shadow of death
[41:27] right i will fear no evil for that
[41:31] with me thyroid and thy staff they
[41:34] comfort me amen so now
[41:37] david was talking about death in the
[41:40] shadow of death
[41:41] death has already taken place buried in
[41:44] in the shadow
[41:45] but then even that in death not evil
[41:49] when the lord died he was in three
[41:51] dimension he was not a dimension to
[41:53] begin with
[41:54] when he died his physical flesh was
[41:56] still on the cross
[41:57] like a dead complete dead man he died
[42:00] like a man
[42:01] but then he was almighty god his soul
[42:05] went to hell the place of rejection
[42:09] his spirit was still in the throne of
[42:11] god ruling the universe
[42:13] amen when he died the devil was happy if
[42:16] i would put in
[42:17] in our modern term there was a party
[42:19] with all the demons
[42:20] finally i've got a word in my hands
[42:22] praise god he doesn't praise god anyway
[42:24] but
[42:24] if the devil praises god you say praise
[42:26] god hallelujah
[42:27] of course the god is dead so i'm the one
[42:29] in charge the whole new universe is
[42:31] under my control
[42:33] and lo and behold the person was there
[42:35] appeared
[42:36] to satan to lucifer to the devil he took
[42:40] the kill of death from him
[42:41] and all the people that is held captive
[42:44] in death
[42:44] their lord releases them or their
[42:46] predecessor sons of god from adam to the
[42:49] last one
[42:50] at the time of jesus who were laying
[42:52] dead
[42:53] who are being kept in captivity by the
[42:54] devil the lord releases them
[42:57] because he is the king of kings and he
[42:59] brought them up from that dimension
[43:01] and the same woman the same god was
[43:03] ruling on the throne of heaven
[43:04] the sixth dimension controlling the
[43:06] universe because the devil came to kill
[43:09] to steal and to destroy but jesus christ
[43:12] came to give life
[43:13] and give it abundantly so if the lord is
[43:16] not in control the devil could have
[43:17] devastated the whole planet
[43:19] but the lord was still in control so
[43:21] even when he died
[43:23] the sea would also come all the way from
[43:25] wherever it came from
[43:26] when you get to the seashore that was a
[43:29] terminating point
[43:30] turning point it would still turn around
[43:32] and go back to where it comes from
[43:34] and the lord can permit certain
[43:35] situation in your life permit the enemy
[43:37] to go all the way
[43:39] so far when you read that point the
[43:41] turning point
[43:42] the lord has put it black sit and stop
[43:45] right
[43:46] amen this is where you can come so far
[43:49] you can go beyond amen because the lord
[43:51] is in control of your life so psalm 23
[43:54] was talking about
[43:55] death and being buried and let's see
[43:57] psalm 24
[43:59] that's when resurrection takes place
[44:01] there is joy the third when jesus christ
[44:02] resurrected
[44:04] when there is a third pool in your life
[44:05] your situation when the lord
[44:07] comes out and take over your situation
[44:09] amen
[44:11] so let's read a couple of scriptures
[44:12] from psalm 24.
[44:14] psalm 24 verse 7 let's read up to
[44:19] hopefully the 10th verse psalm 24 verse
[44:21] 7 to 10.
[44:23] he said lift up your heads oh ye gates
[44:26] and bill and be here lift up ye
[44:28] everlasting doors
[44:30] and the king of glory shall come in now
[44:32] the king who died
[44:33] who was forsaken to die psalm 23 he
[44:36] really died and buried
[44:37] then psalm 24 now he's resurrected the
[44:40] first day of the of the week
[44:41] sunday the lord has resurrected that's
[44:43] why we show up in church on sunday
[44:45] because the lord resurrected on on the
[44:47] first day which is sunday
[44:48] so in the under the new testament and
[44:51] under the grace and the love of god
[44:53] sunday is the day that we honor the lord
[44:55] we honor god all the days but sundays
[44:56] especially that
[44:58] we give we commit all our time to the
[45:00] lord amen
[45:02] has not been the term that we live in
[45:03] when it's sunday evenings shops don't
[45:05] don't open that's right it used to be in
[45:07] the united states some years ago
[45:09] probably not too far maybe 70 plus or
[45:12] certain times
[45:13] certain shops were not even open that's
[45:14] right because sunday is a day of what
[45:17] recogni recognizing or reckoning the
[45:20] the resurrection of jesus christ amen so
[45:23] psalm 24
[45:24] 7 to 10. as we read the first verse he
[45:28] said who is this king of glory
[45:30] the lord of the lord strong and mighty
[45:32] the lord mighty in battle
[45:34] lift up your heads oh ye gates even lift
[45:37] them up ye everlasting doors
[45:39] and the king of glory shall come in who
[45:40] is this king of glory the lord of hosts
[45:43] is the king of glory salah amen so the
[45:46] lord
[45:47] is the king of glory in every situation
[45:49] amen
[45:50] it doesn't matter how the situation is
[45:52] he'll permit a situation to die
[45:55] you might be seem to be forsaken you
[45:57] might go through death
[45:58] we go through death in different forms
[46:00] death is not just only when a person
[46:01] dies physically
[46:02] but we go through pulse and we die daily
[46:05] right we die from one ministry to
[46:07] another
[46:08] we die from one growth onto another
[46:09] higher stage of growth
[46:11] we die from one experience one to
[46:12] another experience we die from one
[46:14] situation to another situation
[46:16] we die from poverty to riches we die
[46:18] from sin
[46:19] untoward righteousness of god we die
[46:22] from the brokenness
[46:23] into masterpieces of the living christ
[46:26] so death comes in different ways
[46:28] amen glory hallelujah so let's we want
[46:31] to take
[46:31] a couple of maybe about 12 instances
[46:35] where the lord used brokenness to lift
[46:38] people who were broken or situations
[46:40] that were broken
[46:41] onto masterpieces glory hallelujah
[46:45] amen so the lord can lift your
[46:46] brokenness into masterpiece
[46:51] when you are strong when you think you
[46:53] can do something
[46:55] that's when you are nothing when moses
[46:57] thought he was something
[46:59] he was the next pharaoh he had all the
[47:01] powers of egypt
[47:03] put yourself in the situation he had all
[47:05] the power of the united states behind
[47:06] him
[47:07] and that was how powerful moses was he
[47:10] was a doctor in those times they didn't
[47:11] specialize in one area
[47:12] he was a lawyer a doctor he knew the art
[47:15] and craft
[47:16] right the secret of medicine he knows
[47:18] all the all the wisdom
[47:19] of the egyptians because in those times
[47:21] for you to become a pharaoh
[47:22] you have to go to saudi baby school you
[47:24] have to go to harvard or yale
[47:26] or oxford to learn not only law but
[47:28] learn their law
[47:29] medicine pharmacy business languages
[47:33] all of them before you can sit on the
[47:35] throne so moses was
[47:37] smart guys smartest of the smart he was
[47:39] real intelligent
[47:40] and so he figured out that yes i know
[47:42] i'm a deliverer my mom taught me to be a
[47:44] deliverer
[47:45] taught me that i was a deliverer it was
[47:47] put in me but it was
[47:48] here amen it doesn't come here yet so
[47:52] moses went in his power and his might
[47:53] and young man
[47:54] what did he do he killed a person so he
[47:57] just
[47:58] qualified himself he ran away to egypt
[48:00] uh sorry to
[48:01] the desert to uh forgotten the land but
[48:05] he ran away from egypt
[48:06] because he was wanted in egypt and he
[48:08] got himself the lord gave him a wife
[48:10] maybe he didn't know the lord gave it to
[48:11] him
[48:12] but the lord gave him an egyptian sorry
[48:14] ethiopian woman
[48:15] a black person he got married to her he
[48:17] became a shepherd
[48:18] taking care of his father's in-lawship
[48:20] right forgotten about being a deliverer
[48:22] because now he fought himself broken he
[48:24] was out of the way
[48:25] so he was thinking maybe the lord would
[48:27] use aeron he would use
[48:29] joshua he used somebody else to do the
[48:32] job so he was happily
[48:34] comfortable with his wife and raising
[48:35] children and doing what everybody else
[48:37] would do
[48:38] amen that's what we know as human beings
[48:40] to do get your comfortable zone
[48:42] get what you enjoy get your house get
[48:44] your job get your business
[48:46] get your family but the lord has has his
[48:48] own mind amen
[48:50] and the lord in his own time came down
[48:52] in the situation of moses
[48:54] when he was broken when he was 80 years
[48:56] old that's when the lord commanded him
[48:58] that moses
[48:59] go i command you to go and take my
[49:01] people from uh from
[49:03] egypt and send them to the promised land
[49:06] and a lot the most was not lord i think
[49:08] probably
[49:09] i'm not the right person you are talking
[49:10] to you know i've got a criminal record
[49:12] in egypt
[49:13] all right i can't go to egypt when i go
[49:15] there they're going to arrest me
[49:16] i'm wanted man how am i going to go to
[49:18] egypt maybe you can send joshua you can
[49:20] send iran you can send get somebody
[49:23] get caleb get somebody to do the job the
[49:26] lord you know i can't talk you know
[49:28] but the law said you are the one i'm
[49:29] going to send
[49:31] when a man disqualifies you that's when
[49:34] the lord qualifies you
[49:36] when you disqualify yourself that is
[49:38] when god qualifies you hallelujah
[49:41] amen people that see themselves
[49:43] unqualified in the kingdom of god
[49:46] they are the one the lord has qualified
[49:47] them before the foundation of the world
[49:49] people who think they don't even deserve
[49:51] to be in heaven look at the
[49:53] in the when jesus died on their cross
[49:55] there was a man on the cross with jesus
[49:58] who said lord when you get to the
[49:59] kingdom remember me because he did
[50:01] himself he saw himself as a criminal
[50:03] he wasn't worthy of eternal life but
[50:06] from the death of his heart he said lord
[50:08] just remember me you know my situation
[50:11] you don't deserve to die
[50:12] but i deserve i was a criminal i did
[50:14] what i did
[50:15] and i deserve to be crucified but you
[50:17] don't deserve it
[50:18] and that man had eternal life right
[50:21] there
[50:21] amen so when you think you can do it
[50:24] when you think your situation is
[50:25] hopeless that's when the lord comes in
[50:28] scoop you up from the situation and
[50:29] bring you out and glorify his name
[50:31] amen the lord gave us a three great
[50:35] covenants
[50:36] or testament that he used to to to show
[50:39] his attribute to mankind
[50:40] the first testament he showed to the
[50:43] first person he created was the
[50:44] testament of law
[50:46] which is adam adams situation god gave
[50:49] them covenant
[50:50] testament sacrament to keep and that
[50:53] sacrament was
[50:54] if you do this i will do this if you
[50:57] don't do this
[50:58] i won't do this so it's conditional
[51:01] right
[51:02] don't touch the tree which is in the
[51:03] midst of the garden
[51:05] the day you touch it you will die that's
[51:07] right
[51:08] i'll kill you that is what he meant to
[51:10] them because
[51:11] he had the power of death and power of
[51:13] life so if you touch
[51:15] this i'll kill you if you don't touch it
[51:18] you live
[51:18] forever right and one thing about human
[51:21] being is that when you tell a human
[51:22] being not to touch something
[51:24] you get curious and you see it in
[51:27] children if you tell your child that hey
[51:29] this stuff will bring you his heart you
[51:30] can't even explain to the daughter
[51:32] your kids that don't don't go around the
[51:34] stuff you can play here you've got all
[51:35] your toys here
[51:36] have fun here this will bring you it's
[51:38] only for mom and dad to tie the stove to
[51:40] cook your food for you
[51:41] when you are there they won't touch it
[51:44] but when you are in the bedroom
[51:45] when you are there they will now they
[51:47] will sneak in and see what is this go
[51:50] and find out try to
[51:51] because they see that their mom twisting
[51:53] their stove you know
[51:54] plugging so what is that even things
[51:56] that they can't reach they will put us
[51:58] through that
[51:59] and sit up on it stand up on it and try
[52:01] to get what is in the drawer
[52:03] because it's the nature of man to find
[52:05] out what is it that he doesn't want you
[52:06] to touch
[52:07] what is in there that doesn't want you
[52:09] to touch i want to touch it so the lord
[52:11] gave them that
[52:12] covenant that do not touch the tree
[52:14] numbers of the garden
[52:15] right away there was curiosity about
[52:17] this tree right
[52:18] adam and eve was wondering and of course
[52:20] the woman was the first one who tied a
[52:21] tree
[52:22] and brought it to the husband you know
[52:24] the story it was what a sex act
[52:26] that's right amen the tree in the middle
[52:28] of the garden the human being
[52:30] the bible use languages in shadows and
[52:32] in types
[52:33] the tree is not just it's not a physical
[52:35] tree it's not an apple
[52:37] it's not a it's not a mango it's not a
[52:39] purple tree it's not a
[52:41] cocoa tree it's not a mahogany tree it's
[52:43] not a
[52:45] pine tree but the human being is a tree
[52:47] if you read someone
[52:48] right the tree human being is type as a
[52:50] tree right so the tree in the midst of
[52:52] the garden
[52:53] is the sex organ in the midst of the
[52:54] garden and the lord had a time and a
[52:57] and season but man went ahead of himself
[53:00] to do what he did
[53:01] and when he did it brought death onto
[53:03] all mankind
[53:04] that was the law so man proved himself
[53:07] that man cannot live by law
[53:09] so the lord has to come in with god
[53:11] grace
[53:12] because man over the years from uh adam
[53:15] to moses we're gonna go to some
[53:17] scriptures man just can't keep lost
[53:19] that's right
[53:20] if you tell man not to go uh go the
[53:22] speed limit is 60
[53:24] miles per hour he's going to make 90.
[53:27] boom goddess my god
[53:29] why did they put this uh odometer or the
[53:31] some call it speedometer
[53:33] why did they put their water 220 and i
[53:36] can't even do 90. i can't do hundred i
[53:38] can't do 70.
[53:39] boom i've got a sports car room
[53:42] and it's just flying all over that's
[53:44] right because man cannot keep law
[53:48] it's not in the nature of man to keep
[53:50] law so the lord
[53:52] the lord allowed the lord to rule on
[53:54] earth for man to experience
[53:56] for man to break the laws for man to go
[53:58] over to realize that you know lord
[54:00] we cannot keep your law we need
[54:02] something else
[54:03] and the law says okay i'll give you
[54:05] grace amen
[54:07] because all of our time from adam who
[54:09] was created perfect
[54:11] moses wasn't perfect moses was born
[54:13] through sex but adam and eve
[54:15] were not born like you and i right the
[54:18] lord created adam he wasn't a baby
[54:20] he came around like a 30 year old person
[54:22] with muscles yes
[54:24] does that we add them he came from the
[54:25] theophany right away that's right
[54:27] to the flesh that's right and adam could
[54:29] speak adam could create
[54:31] right adam could do the things because
[54:33] the bible said adam
[54:34] named a creation of god what name did he
[54:37] give him a josue morales
[54:39] no that wasn't the name there's an
[54:41] attribute there's a nature
[54:43] that adam saw in the theophanic
[54:44] dimension right and you could see that i
[54:46] can't put a lion's nature in a lamp it's
[54:48] not gonna work
[54:50] so he has to pull that that dimension
[54:53] pull the nature of lion
[54:54] from the sixth dimension into it into
[54:57] the um
[54:58] the ethylene uh what they call it
[54:59] earthly lion that has been created
[55:02] he said that he couldn't put the nature
[55:04] of a rabbit
[55:05] into into a turtle it's not going to
[55:07] work so adam has to put turtle
[55:09] from the 6th dimension and put that
[55:11] spirit in the turtle on earth
[55:13] rabbit from the 6th dimension to a
[55:15] rabbit on earth because those natures
[55:17] are not the same thing
[55:19] amen glory hallelujah praise god
[55:21] hallelujah amen
[55:23] like i never just said he's an action
[55:26] person i traveled
[55:27] with him to mexico he's just like he's
[55:29] that's his nature he'll make it happen
[55:31] right away
[55:32] that is nature but amanda is a little
[55:34] bit reserved
[55:36] it's a little bit on the reserve side
[55:38] and the lord put
[55:39] compliment put people together to
[55:41] complement each other
[55:42] one is an action it's just going one is
[55:45] a reserve
[55:46] one is somewhere one is even your
[55:48] children mothers and parents you can see
[55:50] from your children
[55:51] some of the children are quiet some of
[55:53] them are action people
[55:54] some of them are this they are different
[55:56] some of them are introvert some are
[55:57] extrovert
[55:58] some are loud some are quiet some are
[56:00] different a lot made people differently
[56:02] for his glory amen so the lord made us
[56:05] that way
[56:05] for the glory of his name blessed be the
[56:08] name of the lord
[56:09] so we were not made to keep lost because
[56:11] in our nature we want to do what is in
[56:13] us
[56:14] so the law hinders you do not do this
[56:17] and it becomes a problem so you have to
[56:19] adjust yourself to it and being a man
[56:22] being a woman you can't do that so we
[56:23] break loss
[56:24] that state god gave it to us so the lord
[56:27] brought
[56:28] the love from adam up to moses they
[56:31] experience it and i'll go through there
[56:33] we take about 12 of them i want to let a
[56:35] little background
[56:36] now the lord brought grace from the when
[56:38] the lord jesus christ came the law of
[56:40] moses was ruling
[56:41] but then jesus christ brought grace
[56:43] there was a woman that was caught in
[56:45] adultery
[56:46] and the law said that this man has to be
[56:47] stoned that is the law that lord didn't
[56:49] come from
[56:50] from it came from the almighty god to
[56:52] moses to the people and that is what
[56:54] they had in their scriptures
[56:56] that's the secret they have like a screw
[56:59] they have it like a parchment that they
[57:02] tend it's not like we are a paper bible
[57:04] it was a parchment that they they tend
[57:06] and read from
[57:07] so the parchment say that hey if you
[57:09] commit adultery and you are caught if
[57:11] you are not caught
[57:12] things i mean you are lacking but if you
[57:14] get caught in the act
[57:16] we need to stone you that is the law of
[57:17] moses right and jesus
[57:19] came and he was changing the law and
[57:21] they didn't understand him this one was
[57:22] caught in adultery
[57:24] and we need to stone we need to stone
[57:26] her and you are saying that
[57:28] richard in stonehenge what are you
[57:30] talking about
[57:32] they've got their stones in their hands
[57:33] they've got to pray
[57:35] when a lion gets its victim it's happy
[57:38] the devil has got his victim they as
[57:40] long as they were not caught they were
[57:41] sinless
[57:42] but this woman has been caught right in
[57:43] there they didn't even allow her to
[57:45] dress up
[57:45] they brought a naked just to make sure
[57:47] that we caught an adultery
[57:49] and jesus began to rise something on the
[57:50] ground
[57:52] wrote her pardon first and wrote their
[57:55] sin the adultery they committed that
[57:57] night
[57:58] begin to write them on the underground
[57:59] and the soil so when you look at your
[58:01] sin
[58:02] oh wow your name and your what you did
[58:05] i leave that soon and went away and this
[58:08] guy would look at this
[58:10] his sin you committed adultery
[58:14] you killed you stood last night you look
[58:16] at him names
[58:17] still last night he left it soon and
[58:19] went away
[58:21] and one after the other all the macho
[58:23] man strong man was turned ready to stone
[58:25] this lady
[58:26] threw the arson away and they went so
[58:28] when jesus finished writing he turned
[58:30] around
[58:31] and everyone was standing where are
[58:32] their accuses
[58:34] where are they those who are the
[58:35] enforcers who enforce the law
[58:37] said all of them are gone he said
[58:38] neither do i what
[58:40] not nor do i free you you are free
[58:44] i do not condemn you go and sin no more
[58:48] praise god hallelujah it's not different
[58:50] from what
[58:51] the jail preached this morning there are
[58:53] things that we did in the flesh things
[58:55] that our fathers did
[58:56] the lord forgive you but teach your
[58:58] children not to do it no more
[59:00] because the lord he has brought another
[59:03] another covenant
[59:05] for greece amen because man couldn't
[59:07] hold the law
[59:08] the law was way beyond what man could
[59:10] contain
[59:11] so the lord has to bring in another
[59:13] covenant a testament
[59:14] a sacrament that is more easy for man to
[59:17] hold amen
[59:18] so in his grace he'll set his woman free
[59:22] blessed be the name of the lord glory
[59:24] hallelujah to the lord
[59:25] amen praise be to god and the lord
[59:29] when you read psalms he said a table i
[59:31] didn't read all of them but he said the
[59:32] lord a table has now prepared for me the
[59:33] lord set a table
[59:35] before david in the presence of his
[59:36] presence of his enemies
[59:38] what table if you put in a natural table
[59:41] what we put on table
[59:42] in home food the lord put food
[59:46] put a uh things that nourishment on the
[59:49] table
[59:50] we go to starting homes there's always
[59:51] something in the basket on the table
[59:53] maybe oranges some fruits banana so even
[59:56] if you come home there's no meal you can
[59:57] just
[59:58] i mean grass one banana and eat as you
[1:00:00] wait for your meal
[1:00:01] so table is always to what to symbolize
[1:00:04] presence of food
[1:00:05] and the lord put a table in you that
[1:00:07] table
[1:00:08] is the celestial body is the word man is
[1:00:11] the theophany
[1:00:12] is the holy ghost is the image the seed
[1:00:15] of god
[1:00:15] that was in you before the foundation of
[1:00:17] the world and out of that table
[1:00:19] emanates life emanates voices
[1:00:23] voices that steer you around along the
[1:00:25] right path
[1:00:26] amen as you go through life you're gonna
[1:00:28] hear voices
[1:00:30] when a person begin to grow up a certain
[1:00:32] age when you get a certain age
[1:00:34] there will be so many voices talking to
[1:00:35] you when you get to maybe teenage
[1:00:37] age let's say 14 12 15 go in
[1:00:41] voices will be telling you from high
[1:00:42] school from primary school
[1:00:45] that do this they even teach you in
[1:00:47] school certain things that you're not
[1:00:48] supposed to do
[1:00:49] they teach you in school even now it's
[1:00:52] even worse than it used to be
[1:00:53] they teach you i mean your friends will
[1:00:56] teach you how to get a boyfriend
[1:00:57] they even more girls who are virgins
[1:01:00] when they are in school so you sell a
[1:01:01] virgin
[1:01:02] come on what's wrong with you go get
[1:01:04] yourself a boyfriend
[1:01:06] so it's a shame unquote to be a virgin
[1:01:09] it's a shame to keep yourself sacred
[1:01:11] unto the lord he will be teasing you
[1:01:13] that
[1:01:13] what you are virgin come on what's wrong
[1:01:15] with you you haven't seen a man before
[1:01:17] you haven't seen a woman before
[1:01:19] but that is the will of the lord but the
[1:01:21] world has turned it around
[1:01:23] that the things that the lord respect
[1:01:25] the lord large from us
[1:01:27] it's rather a sin before before men
[1:01:30] that's why the bible said that
[1:01:31] the word the things of the world is what
[1:01:33] is foolishness to god
[1:01:34] and the things of god is also
[1:01:36] foolishness to the world
[1:01:38] and you can't have both of them amen you
[1:01:40] can have the world
[1:01:41] and have christ you have to give up one
[1:01:44] and get the other
[1:01:45] amen if you want to be with the world
[1:01:48] enjoy the world and die in sin
[1:01:50] i mean that's the path you want to
[1:01:51] choose go that route the consequence is
[1:01:53] there
[1:01:54] if you want to give all your heart to
[1:01:55] the lord then give all your heart to the
[1:01:57] lord
[1:01:58] the lord will reward you and bless you
[1:01:59] amen god bless you rajab for your same
[1:02:02] one
[1:02:03] praise be to god so the lord has set a
[1:02:05] table before us
[1:02:06] that we can feed from the table is the
[1:02:08] word of the lord that table is in you
[1:02:11] even before you heard the first preacher
[1:02:13] there's something in your voice
[1:02:15] that speak to you my daughter my son
[1:02:18] don't listen to this
[1:02:19] don't go this route this will not help
[1:02:21] you
[1:02:22] but a man has doesn't cannot keep the
[1:02:24] law
[1:02:25] until the new birth comes in the control
[1:02:28] tower takes over
[1:02:30] a man will go over this small voice and
[1:02:32] break the loss of of
[1:02:34] himself the loss of himself that the
[1:02:36] lord has planted in you before the
[1:02:37] foundation of the world
[1:02:38] the lord has put certain sensitive
[1:02:40] sensitivity around every son
[1:02:42] and every daughter of of god there's
[1:02:44] something about you
[1:02:46] that you know it every son of god before
[1:02:49] even you had the first preacher
[1:02:50] before your mom taught you the first
[1:02:52] sunday school lesson there's something
[1:02:54] in you
[1:02:55] there's a voice there's the inner man
[1:02:57] there's eternal connection
[1:02:59] that even in our sinful estate that
[1:03:01] inner connection was there
[1:03:03] that speak to your question when you do
[1:03:05] this just like a child what is going to
[1:03:06] tie the fire
[1:03:08] you know the stove is not allowed to
[1:03:10] touch it
[1:03:11] but because that mom is not around it
[1:03:13] just goes sneaky
[1:03:14] and it's looking around that is not here
[1:03:16] do his stuff let him get some coins and
[1:03:18] go and get candy
[1:03:19] you go to your drawer get some coins and
[1:03:21] get i mean go get your candy
[1:03:23] if the family is large who took my coins
[1:03:26] no say spanish winners i don't know who
[1:03:28] took it
[1:03:30] who took my coin i don't know maybe my
[1:03:31] brothers maybe my sisters
[1:03:33] so you push the blame on blame on other
[1:03:35] people and that's the nature of man
[1:03:37] but when that the control tower takes
[1:03:39] place you don't have to leave the law
[1:03:41] the life in you lives itself in you the
[1:03:44] holy ghost in you
[1:03:46] takes over so the lord said that i'm not
[1:03:48] going to write my loss
[1:03:49] on tablets on on on on tables anymore
[1:03:52] i'm not going to write them on stones
[1:03:54] and parchment but i'm going to write my
[1:03:56] laws
[1:03:56] in your very heart because when the loss
[1:03:58] is in your heart
[1:03:59] the law himself that the law which is
[1:04:01] the love of christ the grace of god
[1:04:04] leaves himself out amen listen we've got
[1:04:07] about different shade of people around
[1:04:08] here
[1:04:09] amen some are black summer hispanic some
[1:04:11] are
[1:04:12] different now if what about the
[1:04:14] lord let's
[1:04:15] take a scenario the lord said okay i'm
[1:04:17] going to give you
[1:04:18] amount of food certain amount of
[1:04:20] proteins and vitamins and
[1:04:23] what else minerals and carbohydrates
[1:04:27] and all the other nutrients to eat to
[1:04:30] get the
[1:04:30] color that you want color that you are
[1:04:33] so if you are black you have to eat this
[1:04:34] amount of carbohydrates
[1:04:36] else you're going to turn into white or
[1:04:38] you're going to turn into a albino right
[1:04:40] or albino whatever you call it if we are
[1:04:42] hispanic and you don't eat the right
[1:04:44] food
[1:04:44] you turn up being a japanese your eye
[1:04:47] slit is going to be like a chinese
[1:04:49] so now do you want how are you going to
[1:04:51] do that we're going to be changing from
[1:04:52] one race to another because you end up
[1:04:54] eating the wrong
[1:04:55] proportion of nutrients and today you
[1:04:58] are japanese that is that you are
[1:04:59] chinese that means that you are hispanic
[1:05:01] you are white you are indian what are
[1:05:03] you going to be
[1:05:04] you don't have to take chat a lot has
[1:05:05] put that in you so as long as you eat
[1:05:07] your food you grow
[1:05:08] yourself you don't have to think about
[1:05:10] how to grow my hair to be to be to be
[1:05:11] black
[1:05:12] or to be blonde or to be yellow the lord
[1:05:14] has ordained everything for you
[1:05:16] yours is you eat the food as long as you
[1:05:18] eat food you're gonna grow your dark
[1:05:20] skin you're gonna grow your brown skin
[1:05:22] your white skin whatever as long as you
[1:05:24] eat the word of the lord
[1:05:25] you don't have to struggle no more the
[1:05:27] struggle days to be over
[1:05:29] the word himself the word is life and
[1:05:32] the word himself will leave himself out
[1:05:34] blessed be the name of the lord jesus
[1:05:36] christ amen
[1:05:37] the lord is good let's quickly go to 12
[1:05:43] let me finish the background now so the
[1:05:46] lord
[1:05:46] through came and established grace and
[1:05:49] greece went on paul
[1:05:51] took over when the lord finished the
[1:05:52] ministry peter preached and paul came
[1:05:55] over and expanded the grace of god
[1:05:57] onto through the to the edges he was the
[1:05:59] first church age
[1:06:00] and pulled himself from his life just
[1:06:02] like moses paul was also a partial madra
[1:06:05] moses is physically killed but paul
[1:06:08] medraku in the court of law you can call
[1:06:09] it agent and albertan
[1:06:11] he didn't really take a stone or take a
[1:06:13] sword and killed
[1:06:14] like moses did but then when they were
[1:06:17] killing stephen
[1:06:18] he was aiding an albertan because in his
[1:06:20] mind stephen was what was i
[1:06:22] disobeying the love of god the law of
[1:06:24] moses so this man this
[1:06:26] christian so-called were not obeying the
[1:06:29] written laws of moses
[1:06:30] so when they were killing stoning
[1:06:32] stephen saw was holding the garments you
[1:06:34] know those times they have like
[1:06:36] the outer garment like you see that the
[1:06:38] jacket and the
[1:06:39] and the shed and so forth so they have a
[1:06:41] rope the outer garment and the inner
[1:06:43] garment
[1:06:44] so the outer garment is kind of thick so
[1:06:46] they have to he was holding the outer
[1:06:48] garment of the people that were stoning
[1:06:50] stephen
[1:06:50] so that they can really do their job
[1:06:52] because the altar government made them
[1:06:53] heavy
[1:06:54] so paul said that he said i'm not even
[1:06:56] worthy to be called
[1:06:58] to be called an apostle right because i
[1:07:00] what
[1:07:01] he partook in killing of stephen he
[1:07:04] persecuted a christian
[1:07:05] he was actually on his way to persecute
[1:07:07] christians when the lord the pill of
[1:07:08] fire met him
[1:07:09] jesus christ met him amen and he said so
[1:07:12] so
[1:07:12] why do you persecute me say who are you
[1:07:16] he knows that that was a pill of fire
[1:07:18] but he didn't know the pillar of father
[1:07:19] that appeared to moses
[1:07:20] has become jesus christ and he didn't
[1:07:22] know that the pillar father was in jesus
[1:07:24] christ
[1:07:25] has become stephen and the christians
[1:07:28] that he was persecuting amen so the same
[1:07:31] pillar of fire that was in jesus of
[1:07:33] nazareth
[1:07:34] 200 2 000 plus years is in you if you
[1:07:37] have the holy ghost
[1:07:38] so you are the jesuses of the of the
[1:07:40] modern day amen you are the modern day
[1:07:42] sins that's why we call you sins
[1:07:44] we are not catholics amen we are not
[1:07:46] dead sins but we are living sins
[1:07:49] because the lord jesus christ is
[1:07:50] dwelling in your temple
[1:07:52] manifesting himself amen glory
[1:07:55] hallelujah
[1:07:56] so that was where the lord used grace
[1:07:58] then the lord brought if you look at all
[1:07:59] these people moses
[1:08:00] the lord called him to the back side of
[1:08:02] the desert to give him the testament of
[1:08:05] law paul the lord called him to arabian
[1:08:07] desert
[1:08:08] to give him the testament of greece
[1:08:10] abraham william abraham the lord called
[1:08:12] him to
[1:08:13] arizona sunset mountain to give him the
[1:08:16] testament of love
[1:08:17] amen so all these three were typing now
[1:08:20] that they were tapping but they were
[1:08:22] bringing
[1:08:22] their three attributes law grace and
[1:08:25] love
[1:08:26] it doesn't mean that when there was lord
[1:08:28] there was no it doesn't mean that when
[1:08:29] there was
[1:08:30] the law there was no grace at all there
[1:08:32] was no love at all
[1:08:33] but the dominant attribute was the law
[1:08:36] it also doesn't mean that when there was
[1:08:37] greece
[1:08:38] or like uh but yeah oh i have greece i
[1:08:41] can do whatever i want
[1:08:42] i can kick this speaker there's greece i
[1:08:45] can kick my brother hey but i was three
[1:08:46] i can punch you in the face the grace of
[1:08:48] god covers me
[1:08:50] that's great i can beat my sisters up
[1:08:52] you can beat your wife that's the grace
[1:08:54] of god
[1:08:54] you know you can get yourself seven
[1:08:56] other women
[1:08:57] if your wife doesn't know how to cook
[1:08:59] because i'm under grace
[1:09:01] i can leave my husband and go get me the
[1:09:02] next husband if my husband is poor and
[1:09:04] broke
[1:09:05] that's the grace of god glory hallelujah
[1:09:07] that's the grace is that the grace
[1:09:09] no that's grace 10 disgrace
[1:09:12] amen that's not the grace of god so it
[1:09:14] doesn't mean that when there's grace
[1:09:16] the law of god is not there but the lord
[1:09:17] has given you the grace
[1:09:19] that the law can be lived from inside
[1:09:22] out
[1:09:22] amen whereas we are struggling now the
[1:09:25] old person that were attempting you to
[1:09:26] sin
[1:09:27] to get to go against the law of god has
[1:09:29] been killed and anna halletted
[1:09:31] and christ himself is living himself his
[1:09:33] law from within
[1:09:35] out amen that's why the paul said that
[1:09:38] the life that i live is no longer the
[1:09:40] soul of tassels
[1:09:42] but christ in me he's living himself by
[1:09:45] his grace
[1:09:46] amen so we can call paul an apostle of
[1:09:48] grace
[1:09:49] amen he didn't have any qualification
[1:09:52] he said things even that he learned
[1:09:53] under gamaliel he was also a doctor a
[1:09:55] lawyer
[1:09:56] a philosopher like moses but he said i
[1:09:58] counted as what
[1:09:59] as damn it was a trash i have to throw
[1:10:02] to the trash can
[1:10:04] it's a garbage there's nothing i could
[1:10:05] do with it the lord didn't need any of
[1:10:07] my education
[1:10:08] he didn't need any of my intellect he
[1:10:10] just needed my heart
[1:10:12] surrender your heart to the lord amen
[1:10:14] the lord is not looking for anything
[1:10:16] from you
[1:10:16] you give him your heart and when you
[1:10:18] give him your heart everything will fall
[1:10:20] in place for you
[1:10:21] glory hallelujah to the lord if you give
[1:10:24] the lord
[1:10:25] all the offering all the money you want
[1:10:26] and you don't give your heart to him
[1:10:28] it's not a blessing if a man loves his a
[1:10:31] man
[1:10:32] buy all the fancy footage for his wife
[1:10:34] buy him multi-billion houses
[1:10:36] take her to all the vacations and what
[1:10:38] else buy ships
[1:10:39] buy jet flight for their wife and she
[1:10:42] doesn't love their wife
[1:10:44] she beat their wife at home she's very
[1:10:46] cruel and
[1:10:47] and very wicked to their wife then that
[1:10:49] is not love
[1:10:51] if a woman claims she's not a husband
[1:10:53] and she doesn't even cook for the
[1:10:54] husband
[1:10:55] she doesn't reach children for her
[1:10:56] husband she doesn't respect the husband
[1:10:58] she just like abuses the husband that is
[1:11:01] not love
[1:11:03] that is no love but the life is what
[1:11:05] things that come from the heart
[1:11:07] amen the hard face because god doesn't
[1:11:09] need your money
[1:11:11] god can rent money from heaven yes we
[1:11:14] need money god uses
[1:11:15] our money to do the things of god things
[1:11:17] of the house but the lord need your
[1:11:19] heart first
[1:11:20] when you give him your heart everything
[1:11:22] will fall in place
[1:11:23] amen so that is the love of christ
[1:11:26] glory hallelujah now let's take a 12
[1:11:30] instances if time will parameters where
[1:11:32] the lord shows
[1:11:33] how he uses our brokenness transform my
[1:11:36] brokenness your brokenness
[1:11:38] into his masterpiece let's look at
[1:11:40] genesis chapter
[1:11:41] 3 verse 22 to 24. that talks about how
[1:11:45] the lord
[1:11:46] uses the broken relationship of man
[1:11:49] to bring him to a mystery of salvation
[1:11:52] and grace
[1:11:53] that mankind has known before so through
[1:11:55] the broken broken relationship between
[1:11:57] adam eve and god the lord used that one
[1:12:00] to show him
[1:12:01] to show them salvation because they
[1:12:03] until then they didn't understand what
[1:12:04] is salvation
[1:12:06] they were perfect let's so let's read
[1:12:08] genesis 20
[1:12:10] genesis 3 22-24 and the lord god said on
[1:12:14] said behold the man has become as one of
[1:12:17] us
[1:12:17] to know good and evil and now let us
[1:12:20] let's
[1:12:21] now let's he put forth his hand and take
[1:12:24] also the tree of life and eat and he
[1:12:26] live for he live forever
[1:12:28] 23 therefore the lord god sent him forth
[1:12:31] from the garden of eden to to till the
[1:12:33] ground
[1:12:34] from whence he was taken so he drove
[1:12:38] out the man and he placed at the east of
[1:12:40] the garden
[1:12:41] of eden cherry beams and flaming sword
[1:12:43] which turned everywhere to keep the way
[1:12:45] of the tree of life so man has partaken
[1:12:48] the partaking
[1:12:50] he has become partaker of the tree of
[1:12:51] death and man knows also to take
[1:12:53] particular tree of life
[1:12:55] but the lord wants to show man mankind
[1:12:57] his grace
[1:12:58] and salvation so he put man out of
[1:13:01] fellowship
[1:13:02] man is this fellowship just like a
[1:13:04] prodigal son when the particular son
[1:13:06] even disfellowshipped himself from the
[1:13:07] father's house
[1:13:09] he returned and the lord showed him
[1:13:10] grace and he understood what his grace
[1:13:13] so mankind before until therefore adam
[1:13:15] didn't know what is salvation
[1:13:17] because they were perfect adam didn't
[1:13:19] have to grow
[1:13:20] from being a baby eve wasn't a baby he
[1:13:22] was around
[1:13:23] 16 to 18. adam was around 30. they
[1:13:26] didn't know what is even son
[1:13:27] but when they fought him and adam saw
[1:13:29] that his power was diminishing
[1:13:31] the power that he heard he could speak
[1:13:33] he could create
[1:13:34] those powers were domination the lion
[1:13:36] could back a team
[1:13:37] and begin to roll you're going to say
[1:13:39] there's something wrong this is the
[1:13:40] first time i could see
[1:13:41] a lion trying to pounce on a lamp and he
[1:13:44] could feel from himself
[1:13:46] that the power the authority is going
[1:13:48] down
[1:13:49] and it's going down and it's going down
[1:13:51] it begins to age
[1:13:52] we're going to get gray head and say no
[1:13:54] that's not what i used to be
[1:13:56] i used to be like just like always 30
[1:13:58] but now i look like
[1:14:00] what am i what do i look like adam was
[1:14:02] created as a spoken word
[1:14:04] but then when he conceived with eve if
[1:14:07] if billy began to swell
[1:14:08] she was called mrs adam but then she her
[1:14:11] name was changed to become mother of all
[1:14:13] if billy was
[1:14:14] getting bigger i said what's going on
[1:14:15] here this is strange you have never seen
[1:14:17] this before my god
[1:14:18] what is going on here if you begin to
[1:14:20] feel pace in pregnancy
[1:14:23] this is weird what is going on here
[1:14:26] did didn't know what's going on here and
[1:14:29] things became
[1:14:30] his belly getting bigger nine months it
[1:14:32] may be dropped
[1:14:33] wow i've never seen anything like this
[1:14:35] before
[1:14:36] what's going on here and the grace of
[1:14:38] god was with them the lord was showing
[1:14:40] them the lord adam was a prophet
[1:14:42] and the lord was using him to show his
[1:14:43] wife you know
[1:14:45] because adam fell on purpose just to
[1:14:46] save the wife because the bible said
[1:14:48] that i don't know what he was doing the
[1:14:50] one was deceived
[1:14:51] but adam knew that if he doesn't save
[1:14:53] their wife the lord was going to destroy
[1:14:55] the wife
[1:14:56] just like abraham so adam has to forward
[1:14:58] his wife
[1:14:59] if someone drowns in a river and you
[1:15:01] want to bring him up
[1:15:02] you can't stand at the bank of the river
[1:15:05] and pull him from under the river
[1:15:07] if you know how to swim you just have to
[1:15:08] dive in deep and bring the person out of
[1:15:10] the river get the water out of him
[1:15:12] and that's what adam did amen adam said
[1:15:15] if i fall with my wife
[1:15:16] the lord will redeem all of us because
[1:15:18] the wife was part of him and he was part
[1:15:20] of christ
[1:15:21] just like the church is part of jesus
[1:15:23] and jesus christ
[1:15:24] amen so even through the broken
[1:15:27] relationship
[1:15:28] the lord ushered on earth into mankind
[1:15:31] fellowship of salvation and grace
[1:15:34] because until then they didn't know what
[1:15:35] is grace
[1:15:36] but the lord had more attribute than
[1:15:38] perfection they were living in perfect
[1:15:40] perfect estate but the lord has to allow
[1:15:43] we know what happened therefore to come
[1:15:45] in and then the devil came in
[1:15:47] and the lord showed the devil that they
[1:15:49] are still my children amen
[1:15:50] there's no way i'm going to let them go
[1:15:52] it doesn't it doesn't matter how my
[1:15:54] daughter my son is far gone
[1:15:55] i'm just going to hold her in my heart
[1:15:57] i'm just going to pray for my
[1:15:59] my children and i know my god who
[1:16:01] delivered me will deliver them
[1:16:02] amen glory hallelujah let's go to um
[1:16:07] exodus chapter 32 verse 1 to 8
[1:16:10] the broken laws of god god gave his laws
[1:16:13] to mankind
[1:16:17] but man couldn't hold the loss of god
[1:16:20] exodus 32 1-8 i think i'll read just
[1:16:24] verse seven and eight
[1:16:26] for the sake of time exodus 32
[1:16:30] 7-8 and the lord said unto moses go get
[1:16:34] thee down
[1:16:35] go go the go get thee down for thy
[1:16:38] people which thou
[1:16:39] brought us out of the land of egypt have
[1:16:41] corrupted themselves
[1:16:43] they say they have turned aside quickly
[1:16:45] out of the way which
[1:16:46] i commanded them they have made them a
[1:16:48] molten calf
[1:16:49] and have worshiped it and have
[1:16:50] sacrificed their own to and said this by
[1:16:53] the god by thy gas
[1:16:55] or israel which have brought thee out of
[1:16:57] the land of egypt
[1:16:58] now these are the people the lord
[1:17:00] delivered from egypt when they were
[1:17:01] under bondage
[1:17:03] and when moses was sent to go and get
[1:17:04] the law
[1:17:06] moses turret in other words moses is
[1:17:08] delayed just like
[1:17:09] but a jack preached a couple of sundays
[1:17:12] ago
[1:17:13] about when saw probably three sundays
[1:17:15] ago when
[1:17:16] uh samuel odin or commander sought to go
[1:17:19] and wait for the sacrifice
[1:17:20] saul was history he couldn't wait he was
[1:17:24] he was just like
[1:17:25] because of the people the pressure on
[1:17:26] the people he came into the people's
[1:17:28] pressure
[1:17:29] and he went to sacrifice which was not
[1:17:31] ordained for a king to do
[1:17:32] the king was a king the priest and the
[1:17:35] prophet do the sacrifice
[1:17:36] and so because he went ahead of god i
[1:17:38] went ahead of samson he was disqualified
[1:17:40] he was put away from being he wasn't as
[1:17:42] qualified i was put away from being a
[1:17:43] king
[1:17:44] and david took his his mantle took his
[1:17:46] place
[1:17:47] so patience is a great virtue and so man
[1:17:50] couldn't wait moses probably said for
[1:17:53] this man if you read from verse one he
[1:17:54] said
[1:17:54] for this man moses we don't know what
[1:17:56] has become of him we got to get
[1:17:57] something in worship
[1:17:58] yes he brought us from egypt but he's
[1:18:01] been on the mountain we don't know
[1:18:02] jessica but the brahmana said the pillar
[1:18:03] of fire was with him we don't know
[1:18:05] what's going on
[1:18:06] geddes and and aaron also cave into
[1:18:09] their demand
[1:18:10] to their ear and make made an idol
[1:18:13] that's right and they they begin to
[1:18:14] worship idol that's right
[1:18:16] that was what they broke the laws of god
[1:18:18] but then even through that
[1:18:20] god showed his grace unto mankind god
[1:18:23] so redeemed them from from from their
[1:18:25] brokenness and brought them together
[1:18:27] show forgiveness because true grace uh
[1:18:29] true
[1:18:30] they disobeyed the law the lord wanted
[1:18:32] to kill them but moses stood in the gap
[1:18:35] say lord if you kill them the egyptians
[1:18:37] will say that you couldn't forfeit what
[1:18:38] you said you're gonna do yeah you
[1:18:40] couldn't take them from the egypt to the
[1:18:42] promised land
[1:18:43] so the lord i mean obeyed the voice of a
[1:18:46] man
[1:18:46] how could god do that because christ was
[1:18:49] in moses
[1:18:49] right christ in moses was pleading for
[1:18:51] the people right
[1:18:53] of their unbelief and their sin amen
[1:18:56] so even through the broken things god
[1:18:58] will bring
[1:18:59] masterpiece out of that glory hallelujah
[1:19:04] blessed be the name of the lord let's
[1:19:06] look at numbers
[1:19:08] how broken covenant will turn into
[1:19:11] something else
[1:19:13] glory hallelujah god gave man a covenant
[1:19:17] to keep
[1:19:17] and man broke his covenant but through
[1:19:20] that the lord gave man
[1:19:21] a more excellent covenant a covenant of
[1:19:23] unconditional love
[1:19:25] the first covenant was do this and i'll
[1:19:27] do this the second covenant is
[1:19:29] i love you anyways amen glory hallelujah
[1:19:33] and let's read from numbers chapter 25
[1:19:36] verse 1 to 5.
[1:19:44] numbers 25 let's just read okay and
[1:19:48] israel aboard in shethem and the people
[1:19:50] began to commit hodom
[1:19:51] with the daughters of moab and they
[1:19:54] called the people onto the sacrifices of
[1:19:55] their gods and the people did eat
[1:19:57] and bowed down to their gas gas at the
[1:20:00] idols
[1:20:01] and israel joined himself to baal poor
[1:20:03] and the anger of the lord was kindled
[1:20:05] against israel and the law said unto
[1:20:07] moses
[1:20:07] take all the heads of the people and
[1:20:09] hang them up before the lord
[1:20:11] against the son that the fierce anger of
[1:20:14] the lord may not be turned i will
[1:20:16] maybe turn away from israel and moses
[1:20:18] said unto the judges of israel slay
[1:20:20] everyone everyone has men that were
[1:20:22] joined to baal power
[1:20:24] that is worshipping idols god told them
[1:20:27] not to have o israel the lord our god is
[1:20:29] one
[1:20:30] but yes israel were enticed to worship
[1:20:33] idols under balaam's bidding
[1:20:35] and the lord did what the lord slay
[1:20:37] those who worship idols
[1:20:39] but through that the lord gave them
[1:20:41] grace unconditional covenant
[1:20:43] which they don't need to do themselves
[1:20:45] god has to live in them
[1:20:46] to do his own bedding amen glory
[1:20:49] hallelujah
[1:20:50] let's go to the fourth one broken and
[1:20:52] contrast spirit
[1:20:54] we know david was a king of god and
[1:20:57] david went through a lot of challenges
[1:20:59] david did a lot of mistakes so many of
[1:21:01] them serious mistakes he killed he
[1:21:03] committed adultery he did this he did
[1:21:04] this
[1:21:05] but the lord used that circumstances and
[1:21:07] his rookiness
[1:21:08] to show him an unconditional life
[1:21:11] because the first la the first law
[1:21:14] man couldn't obey law so the law should
[1:21:17] not show them that i'm not going to even
[1:21:19] use the law
[1:21:20] my grace is sufficient for you amen so
[1:21:22] the grace of god was with david
[1:21:24] as david would have been wiped out but
[1:21:26] the grace of god was with him
[1:21:28] and the lord established the covenant
[1:21:30] with david made him a king
[1:21:31] a prophet and a priest amen right glory
[1:21:34] hallelujah
[1:21:36] psalm psalm 51 16-19
[1:21:40] for thou desired for thou desired not
[1:21:43] sacrifice
[1:21:44] else would i give it thou delightest not
[1:21:46] invent offering
[1:21:48] the sacrifices of god are a broken
[1:21:50] spirit
[1:21:51] and a broken and a contrite heart oh god
[1:21:54] thou not despise so god doesn't look for
[1:21:57] a sacrifice
[1:21:59] he doesn't love your material things he
[1:22:01] loves you
[1:22:02] amen he loves your heart when our heart
[1:22:06] is broken
[1:22:07] when your spirit is broken the lord
[1:22:09] loves the spirit that is broken
[1:22:11] when we are praying for somebody and
[1:22:13] that that
[1:22:14] whatever the person is going through
[1:22:15] doesn't touch you you pray just like you
[1:22:18] are throwing words in the air
[1:22:20] but if the person that waits or what the
[1:22:22] person is going through breaks you
[1:22:24] breaks your heart if your your brother
[1:22:25] or your sister's heart is broken
[1:22:27] and if your heart get broken then you
[1:22:29] can go into that spiritual desperation
[1:22:31] and pray for your sister
[1:22:32] for your brother but if it doesn't touch
[1:22:34] you just oh lord you just
[1:22:36] i mean rattle something in the
[1:22:37] atmosphere and it just goes into thin
[1:22:39] air but when you put yourself in that
[1:22:41] spirit
[1:22:42] a broken and a contrite heart that is a
[1:22:45] son of god
[1:22:46] as jack was saying in the morning when
[1:22:48] someone is going through something
[1:22:50] and you can get it get with that person
[1:22:52] or get into the spirit
[1:22:54] and through what is going through and
[1:22:56] when you pray
[1:22:57] god cannot stay god has to come in amen
[1:23:00] and that's the way we should pray one
[1:23:02] time i heard a sort of a preacher
[1:23:04] someone from a foreign land called him
[1:23:06] that pray for us we have we are having
[1:23:08] rain in our house
[1:23:09] and so okay i know i'll pray for you
[1:23:10] said no you don't know what you
[1:23:12] you don't know what i mean is rain we've
[1:23:15] got a
[1:23:16] rainstorm and the roof is gone and rain
[1:23:19] is literally pouring into our room
[1:23:21] the preacher said i got up quickly from
[1:23:23] my bed and begin to pray
[1:23:25] because the first time when he heard it
[1:23:26] from the from from the phone he said oh
[1:23:28] okay but i know i'm going to pray for
[1:23:29] you
[1:23:30] he said no no you don't know what i'm
[1:23:31] talking about i mean water is coming
[1:23:33] into our room
[1:23:34] into our house not in the house but the
[1:23:36] room the bedroom
[1:23:38] and jump up and pray and that made a
[1:23:40] difference
[1:23:41] so when you pray when something touch
[1:23:43] you when something touch your heart
[1:23:46] when you can go into your brother's
[1:23:47] feeling even your enemy's feeling
[1:23:50] someone who has wronged you someone who
[1:23:52] has did you evil
[1:23:53] if you can go into his or her spirit and
[1:23:56] say lord forgive him
[1:23:57] lord don't hold it against him amen
[1:24:00] stepping for him
[1:24:01] as we heard uh willie abraham did when a
[1:24:04] young man
[1:24:04] young man and young woman who were
[1:24:05] committing an act of sex
[1:24:07] right in the church and he the holy
[1:24:10] ghost came literally the angel of the
[1:24:12] lord said
[1:24:12] speak whatever you want right you want
[1:24:14] to sleep them there just speak they will
[1:24:16] die right away
[1:24:17] but they said i forgive them amen and
[1:24:19] that please the lord
[1:24:21] hallelujah amen
[1:24:24] i want to have had experience with a
[1:24:25] young minister there was some situation
[1:24:27] that a
[1:24:28] sister has been doing certain things for
[1:24:30] is go to the peak
[1:24:31] and the young minister the holy ghost
[1:24:33] asked him the system was miriam
[1:24:35] he said he said whatever you want speak
[1:24:38] so the brother come he said but i don't
[1:24:39] know what to do i said brother
[1:24:41] look at the name miriam right you know
[1:24:43] miriam in the bible what miriam did
[1:24:45] with his brother moses if you put a case
[1:24:47] on her
[1:24:48] or if you pick something negative on her
[1:24:50] she's your sister
[1:24:52] you are the same person you're going to
[1:24:53] pray and remove the case on her
[1:24:55] so why do you put the case on her
[1:24:57] forgive her it's an attribute that is
[1:24:59] coming from my name she doesn't know
[1:25:00] what he's doing
[1:25:00] just pray for her the lord will quieten
[1:25:02] her down and said i'll take your advice
[1:25:04] so learn to forgive amen don't hold
[1:25:07] grudges
[1:25:08] let it go the same lord i gave you grace
[1:25:11] give grace unto other people
[1:25:13] because if the lord should bring our
[1:25:14] sins and our mistakes here
[1:25:17] we cannot count it one time willie
[1:25:19] abraham was working
[1:25:20] and he met a a lady drinking with
[1:25:23] policemen old police officers yes sir
[1:25:25] and in his heart he condemned them and
[1:25:27] the lord condemned him too
[1:25:29] the lord showed him his sins amen and he
[1:25:31] repented quickly
[1:25:32] and he went to the people and he loved
[1:25:34] them and prayed for them and talked to
[1:25:36] them and the one repented right on their
[1:25:37] spot that's right
[1:25:38] the woman was in shorts and he was
[1:25:40] condemning her they were drinking and
[1:25:42] having you know those things
[1:25:43] so you don't condemn somebody have not
[1:25:46] been the grace of god
[1:25:47] you and i would have been worse than
[1:25:48] probably those people
[1:25:50] but this is love and it's grace that
[1:25:52] contains you and i
[1:25:53] so when you see those point the way they
[1:25:55] are you go into their situation
[1:25:58] and pray for them and the lord will make
[1:26:00] a difference amen
[1:26:02] glory hallelujah a contrite and a broken
[1:26:04] spirit
[1:26:05] the lord loves it let's go a little
[1:26:08] further to um
[1:26:10] a broken prophet elijah
[1:26:13] first kings chapter 19 1-3
[1:26:17] glory hallelujah a prophet was broken
[1:26:21] but the lord used his spirit five times
[1:26:24] amen
[1:26:25] first kings one king nineteen one two
[1:26:27] three for the sake of time
[1:26:29] when you go you can read the whole story
[1:26:31] and ahab
[1:26:32] let me even start from the fourth verse
[1:26:36] okay verse one and ahab told jezebel all
[1:26:38] that elijah had done
[1:26:40] and and with that how he had slain all
[1:26:42] the prophets with the sword
[1:26:44] then jezebel sent a messenger on to
[1:26:46] elijah saying
[1:26:47] so let the gas that's her idols do to
[1:26:51] do to me and more also if i make nothing
[1:26:54] than life
[1:26:55] your life as the life of one of them by
[1:26:57] tomorrow about this time and when he saw
[1:26:59] that
[1:26:59] he arose and went for his life and came
[1:27:02] to beersheba
[1:27:03] which belonged to judah and left his
[1:27:05] seven there verse four
[1:27:07] but he himself went on a day's journey
[1:27:10] into the wilderness and came and sat
[1:27:13] down under a juniper tree and requested
[1:27:14] for himself that he might die
[1:27:17] and said it is enough now o lord
[1:27:20] take away my life for i am not better
[1:27:22] than my father's
[1:27:23] and as he lay and slept under a juniper
[1:27:25] tree behold
[1:27:26] then an angel angel touched him and said
[1:27:29] unto him arise and eat
[1:27:31] and he looked and behold there was cake
[1:27:33] baking on the coast
[1:27:34] and cruise of water at his head and he
[1:27:37] did eat and drink
[1:27:38] and laid him down again and the angel of
[1:27:40] the lord came again the second time and
[1:27:42] touched him and said
[1:27:43] i rise and eat because the journey is
[1:27:45] too great for thee
[1:27:46] and they arose and it eats and went in
[1:27:48] the strength of that
[1:27:50] meets 40 days and 40 night unto horrible
[1:27:53] the mount of the lord
[1:27:54] amen now this is a great prophet one of
[1:27:56] the greatest prophets of all time
[1:27:58] elijah and the lord he did the bidding
[1:28:00] of the lord
[1:28:01] when israel became a adult worshipers
[1:28:04] he threw a challenge to them according
[1:28:06] to what the lord told him and he killed
[1:28:08] 400 prophet
[1:28:09] of jezebel so when jesus jesus heard
[1:28:11] that hey you've killed my prophet false
[1:28:13] preachers
[1:28:14] jesus said look i'm going to make those
[1:28:16] people the way you kill them
[1:28:17] tomorrow by this time if your head stays
[1:28:20] on you
[1:28:20] then i'm not jezebel a woman chasing a
[1:28:23] prophet of god
[1:28:24] sometimes the lord can allow certain
[1:28:26] situation you might say that i'm a
[1:28:28] believer why am i going through sickness
[1:28:29] why am i going through this why is kobe
[1:28:32] attacking family it doesn't mean
[1:28:33] kovit cannot attack a believer it
[1:28:35] doesn't mean a believer cannot die of
[1:28:36] cancer
[1:28:37] it doesn't mean if a believer can't dies
[1:28:39] of cancer then it's a sinner no
[1:28:41] it doesn't mean if he believer does of
[1:28:42] cover 19 coronavirus then he's not a
[1:28:44] saint
[1:28:45] that's right the lord can take the
[1:28:46] person's life at the time of this season
[1:28:49] elijah was a prophet of god but he died
[1:28:52] of uh
[1:28:52] boils boss in modern times like tumor
[1:28:55] that can elijah the prophet
[1:28:57] but even on his own on his barrier
[1:28:59] police when a a young man i think the
[1:29:01] only son of his mother
[1:29:02] had died and they go to a place and they
[1:29:04] threw the casket
[1:29:06] the person resurrected that's right the
[1:29:08] pillow fire was still restaurant on the
[1:29:09] largest bones
[1:29:10] amen and we have seen the pillow
[1:29:12] fighting william brahms
[1:29:15] barrier police many times in the form of
[1:29:18] dive
[1:29:18] in the form of different animals coming
[1:29:21] out
[1:29:22] so if you're a saint you're always a
[1:29:23] saint amen
[1:29:26] you don't become a devil because you had
[1:29:28] a sickness because
[1:29:29] you you broke because you lost your
[1:29:31] house you don't become an unbeliever you
[1:29:34] don't become a sinner
[1:29:35] because that's what job's friends
[1:29:37] thought because they felt like job
[1:29:39] we are human beings we are doing some
[1:29:40] secret sin there's no way this trials
[1:29:41] will come on you
[1:29:42] but god can allow a believer to go to
[1:29:44] trials so jezebel
[1:29:47] was chasing after elijah elijah has to
[1:29:49] flee for his life
[1:29:50] and he has a lot to take his life away
[1:29:52] because it was it was too much for him
[1:29:54] but the lord said that it is not time
[1:29:56] for me to take you away
[1:29:58] he sent an angel to bring a big bread
[1:30:01] big kick where did he get a break from
[1:30:04] dick tortillas
[1:30:05] uh uh but i was facing food uh what was
[1:30:08] the name of what is the name he calls it
[1:30:10] the puerto rican food i used platinum to
[1:30:13] cook how do you call it
[1:30:14] tortonis victor tonys how did how did
[1:30:17] how did it where did he come from the
[1:30:19] lord is a creator
[1:30:21] he doesn't have to have a bakery in
[1:30:22] heaven you can just speak
[1:30:24] just by thought and that attribute is in
[1:30:27] you amen
[1:30:28] if you get have faith in god certain
[1:30:30] things you don't have to pray too much
[1:30:32] just by your heart by your decree
[1:30:35] because the same god is in you amen and
[1:30:37] when you speak your word is as good as
[1:30:39] the lord
[1:30:40] glory hallelujah as brother jack told us
[1:30:43] this morning
[1:30:43] the prophet stood in for us because the
[1:30:45] prophet stood in the prince of the lord
[1:30:47] and they became christ and when they
[1:30:49] speak it wasn't moses
[1:30:51] it wasn't paul it wasn't really abraham
[1:30:53] but it was jesus christ and then they
[1:30:55] become one with them
[1:30:56] and when they speak they are sons of god
[1:30:59] and you are a daughter of god
[1:31:00] amen regardless of what you can speak
[1:31:03] and situations will change and so we
[1:31:06] have to learn to speak amen
[1:31:08] don't let the devil would push you to
[1:31:09] the corner but you have to have to
[1:31:11] speak out speak out your voice because
[1:31:13] your voice is as good as jesus christ
[1:31:15] speaking amen
[1:31:16] if jesus christ of 2000 years ago comes
[1:31:18] here he cannot help you
[1:31:20] right if he comes here in his body that
[1:31:22] he was in at the age of 33 and a half
[1:31:24] or 33 there's nothing he could do for
[1:31:26] you he can only point you back to what
[1:31:28] he already did for you
[1:31:29] that i took your place on calvary at
[1:31:31] that for you
[1:31:32] i took i was a sacrifice i took your
[1:31:35] sins upon me
[1:31:36] why do you let the devil condemn you of
[1:31:37] sin you as good
[1:31:39] guiltless as girls can be you are
[1:31:41] justified even more than justified
[1:31:43] you have been forgiven it's not in the
[1:31:45] book of it's not in my book
[1:31:47] he'll show you this is white this is how

[1:32:02] very righteousness

[1:32:05] mind condemn you
[1:32:06] amen the lord doesn't remember that it's
[1:32:09] in the sea
[1:32:10] of forgetfulness don't go back to that's
[1:32:13] the end fish
[1:32:14] amen don't go and fish see your
[1:32:16] forgetful from from your brother
[1:32:19] don't go and switch from your own self
[1:32:20] hallelujah don't go and fish your past
[1:32:22] it's not your past
[1:32:24] is the person is the person that was
[1:32:25] living in the house who did that evil
[1:32:28] and that person has been evicted and
[1:32:30] unharlated
[1:32:31] and there's a new occupant that occupies
[1:32:33] jesus christ
[1:32:35] and jesus christ is what is perfect amen
[1:32:38] glory hallelujah
[1:32:39] he was just using his attribute to show
[1:32:41] you what he wanted you to see
[1:32:43] glory hallelujah let's go to the broken
[1:32:47] uh broken pictures judges chapter 17
[1:32:49] verse 16 to 23.
[1:32:51] i'll read just two verses 19 and 20
[1:32:54] judges 7 16-23 broken pictures
[1:32:58] and let's see how the lord used brooking
[1:33:00] pictures in the house of 300 men
[1:33:02] to win victory over the enemy so gideon
[1:33:05] and the 300 men
[1:33:07] that were with him came on to
[1:33:11] came onto the outside of the camp in the
[1:33:12] beginning beginning of the middle watch
[1:33:15] and they had but they had but newly set
[1:33:18] their watch and they blew their trumpets
[1:33:21] and breed their pictures that way in
[1:33:22] their hands
[1:33:23] and the three com three companies blew
[1:33:26] their trumpet
[1:33:26] and break their pictures and held a lamp
[1:33:29] in their hands
[1:33:30] in their left hand and their trumpets in
[1:33:32] their in their right hand
[1:33:34] hands to blow weather and they cried the
[1:33:36] sword of the lord and of gideon
[1:33:38] remember this god uses men as well amen
[1:33:42] god was using gideon so they said the
[1:33:44] sword of the lord
[1:33:45] and of gideon right because god
[1:33:47] glorified himself in his children
[1:33:49] amen god put his glory in you god put
[1:33:52] his glory in his pastor
[1:33:53] god put his glory in his daughters god
[1:33:55] put his glory in his children
[1:33:57] because they are him amen so he said
[1:34:00] that sort of the lord
[1:34:01] and of gideon gideon was a judge he's
[1:34:03] actually called a prophet of that time
[1:34:05] he was delivering israel from from their
[1:34:07] battles and the lord conf
[1:34:10] destroyed us if you okay let's go and
[1:34:13] stood
[1:34:14] and the 300 blew their trumpets let me
[1:34:16] see the end of the story i just want to
[1:34:20] to make the story i don't want to read
[1:34:21] too long to make the story long the lord
[1:34:23] killed all the
[1:34:24] other he made the enemies kill
[1:34:26] themselves that's right they kind of
[1:34:27] killed themselves they didn't have to
[1:34:29] fight a battle and they just chased them
[1:34:31] and just
[1:34:32] to their spouse and so forth so
[1:34:34] sometimes you don't have to fight a
[1:34:35] battle
[1:34:35] right you have to be in line with the
[1:34:37] lord right
[1:34:39] if the lord has wanted to tell you to
[1:34:40] take a picture a picture that you hold
[1:34:42] there pictures like a container
[1:34:44] something you put water in
[1:34:45] like a water bottle that's what you hold
[1:34:47] here but i don't want you to
[1:34:48] throw it away it's become like an adult
[1:34:51] break it smash it
[1:34:52] and let the lord take control and when
[1:34:54] you let the love come to come true
[1:34:56] you can use it the thing that the unwed
[1:34:58] things that you thought it wasn't
[1:35:00] worthy moses had a road his road was
[1:35:02] just a rod that used to
[1:35:04] head his ship but the road could turn
[1:35:06] into a sneak
[1:35:07] a serpent the road could change
[1:35:09] situation the road could turn water into
[1:35:11] blood
[1:35:12] one of the first miracles moses did was
[1:35:14] turn uh
[1:35:15] blood water into blood the blood of the
[1:35:17] waters of the egyptians
[1:35:19] it was a judgment time but when jesus
[1:35:22] came
[1:35:22] he went for a wedding he attended a
[1:35:24] wedding and there was not enough
[1:35:26] wine in those times they drink wine and
[1:35:29] so jesus
[1:35:30] mother mary is i mean foster mother
[1:35:33] he knew who he was so he said you know
[1:35:35] do something here
[1:35:36] and he told people that do whatever he
[1:35:38] tells you do whatever jesus tells you
[1:35:41] and he said fill the
[1:35:43] the the parts with water they fold it
[1:35:46] and they turn into wine right away and
[1:35:49] they wonder where
[1:35:50] this wine came from where did it come
[1:35:51] from did they know that jesus has begun
[1:35:54] his miracle
[1:35:55] what is wine one is a stimulation it's
[1:35:57] life
[1:35:58] so moses brought law which was judgment
[1:36:02] but jesus christ came he didn't turn
[1:36:05] water into blood
[1:36:06] but they turned water into what into one
[1:36:08] is something to consume to bring life to
[1:36:09] stimulate
[1:36:10] jesus christ came to give life life and
[1:36:12] give it abundantly
[1:36:14] amen glory hallelujah blessed be the
[1:36:17] name of the lord seven
[1:36:19] broken loose the love use a little piece
[1:36:22] of broken
[1:36:23] a loaf of bread two pieces and broke it
[1:36:26] and gave it bless it and gave to feed
[1:36:28] five thousand people
[1:36:29] a broken bread of bread from the hands
[1:36:32] of a little boy
[1:36:33] let's read matthew 26 chapter 26 verse
[1:36:37] 24 to
[1:36:38] 28. matthew 26
[1:36:41] 24-28 and i'll jump
[1:36:44] right ahead and read the 26th verse and
[1:36:47] as they were eating jesus took bread and
[1:36:49] blessed it
[1:36:49] and break it and give it to the
[1:36:51] disciples that was even their love
[1:36:52] supper
[1:36:53] and said take it this is my body and
[1:36:55] into their cup
[1:36:56] and give thanks and give it to them
[1:36:58] drink you of it
[1:37:00] for this my blood and the new testament
[1:37:02] which is shared for many
[1:37:03] for the remission of sin so his bl his
[1:37:06] life
[1:37:07] his blood was a testament to wipe away
[1:37:10] our sin
[1:37:11] but then we remember the story where
[1:37:12] jesus used a broken bread
[1:37:14] just from a little boy and just a couple
[1:37:17] of fish
[1:37:18] and fed 5 000 people just present
[1:37:20] yourself to the lord amen amen
[1:37:23] who said just show up amen it's not what
[1:37:25] you have
[1:37:26] about who you are amen you are a
[1:37:28] standard verse to the lord
[1:37:30] just give yourself to the lord and lord
[1:37:32] himself will work his way out
[1:37:34] glory hallelujah to the lord so the lord
[1:37:36] can take broken piece of bread
[1:37:38] which is not much and then fit five
[1:37:40] thousand if you surrender yourself that
[1:37:42] your littleness
[1:37:43] your brokenness the lord will use your
[1:37:45] brokenness to create masterpieces out of
[1:37:47] it
[1:37:48] amen let's read um
[1:37:51] mark chapter 2 verse 25 broken roof
[1:37:54] there was a
[1:37:55] a family that their loved one was sick
[1:37:59] and there was a prayer meeting prayer
[1:38:01] campaign whatever you call it
[1:38:03] there was multitude of people they
[1:38:05] didn't have a prayer prayer card

[1:38:08] go there if you don't have a prayer card
[1:38:10] there was no way the meeting was here
[1:38:12] there was multitude
[1:38:14] so they had to come out they want to
[1:38:16] bring this this this person before the

[1:38:54] your faith
[1:38:56] it's about even overwhelm jesus having
[1:38:58] seen this
[1:38:59] this this faith before the lord couldn't

[1:39:29] act
[1:39:30] the children of israel were in the act
[1:39:31] moses and his people ate family
[1:39:33] and the lord kept them whilst there were
[1:39:35] a lot of things going around

[1:39:40] amen just have faith in god don't be
[1:39:43] don't don't be afraid
[1:39:45] glory hallelujah
[1:39:49] oh glory hallelujah time will permit you
[1:39:51] to read it
[1:39:53] broken roof what an amazing grace
[1:39:57] let's read one more from about three
[1:39:59] four more left
[1:40:00] three more left rather luke 7 37
[1:40:03] broken alabaster box
[1:40:07] a woman that was unworthy even to go
[1:40:10] before the lord doesn't permit her
[1:40:12] she was nobody but this woman had
[1:40:16] a box an ointment or a perfume a
[1:40:19] lavender whatever you spray
[1:40:21] that she bought out of prostitution
[1:40:24] it wasn't the job that she prayed for
[1:40:26] and the lord gave her that job and get
[1:40:28] that job and came and paid tight no
[1:40:30] it was nothing of the la of that but out
[1:40:32] of prostitution
[1:40:33] she bought that alabaster box of
[1:40:36] ointments
[1:40:36] it was very expensive it was like i
[1:40:39] don't know i don't know the
[1:40:40] expensive ointment we have we have on
[1:40:42] the land it was i don't know which one
[1:40:43] but
[1:40:44] you you know them right she's pre she
[1:40:47] brought this bottle
[1:40:48] and anointed the lord before his barrier
[1:40:50] before his death barry and resurrection
[1:40:52] and the people around look at this woman
[1:40:55] that oh she claims to be a he claims to
[1:40:57] be a prophet
[1:40:58] he doesn't even know that this one is a
[1:40:59] prostitute and this one is wiping his
[1:41:01] feet with his with her hair
[1:41:04] but before the lord this one was writing
[1:41:06] her salvation
[1:41:08] this man is wiping her sins away
[1:41:11] this woman is receiving eternal life
[1:41:14] because he knew she knew what was in
[1:41:17] jesus
[1:41:18] but the pharisee who invited jesus
[1:41:20] christ he didn't know what was in jesus
[1:41:22] but there was no control that were there
[1:41:24] they just invited jesus christ to mock
[1:41:26] him
[1:41:26] but this woman got salvation out of her
[1:41:29] brokenness
[1:41:30] after the broken alabaster oil we are
[1:41:32] preaching about here today
[1:41:34] amen so in your brokenness the lord can
[1:41:37] still use you
[1:41:38] glory hallelujah to the lord blessed be
[1:41:41] the name of the lord
[1:41:42] and if a time will permit you to read
[1:41:44] verse um look you can read in two places
[1:41:47] luke 17 37
[1:41:48] and matthew 26 6-7
[1:41:51] our cut is short and one of the
[1:41:53] pharisees desired him that he will eat
[1:41:55] with him and he went into the francis
[1:41:57] house and sat down to meet
[1:41:58] and behold a woman in the city which was
[1:42:00] a sinner
[1:42:01] when she knew that jesus sat at meat in
[1:42:04] the pharisee's house
[1:42:06] brought an alabaster box of ointment
[1:42:09] 38 and he stood at his feet behind him
[1:42:11] weeping
[1:42:12] begin to wash his feet with tears and
[1:42:15] he'd wipe
[1:42:15] them with the hairs of his head and kiss
[1:42:18] his feet
[1:42:19] and anointed them with with the ointment
[1:42:22] and he she received life antenna she
[1:42:25] didn't go back broken
[1:42:26] she went back full of joy liberated
[1:42:29] released
[1:42:30] from all her uh whatever call it all the
[1:42:34] prostitution
[1:42:35] the lord forgiven amen only adultery the
[1:42:38] lord forgiven
[1:42:39] so it doesn't matter where how far
[1:42:40] you've gone it doesn't matter your
[1:42:42] situation
[1:42:43] or your family the lord has got a power
[1:42:45] if only you believe
[1:42:47] just believe it amen broken sisters the
[1:42:51] lord did
[1:42:52] something miracles with two broken
[1:42:53] sisters mary and martha
[1:42:55] john chapter 11 26 and i won't read it
[1:42:57] you know the story
[1:42:59] the the only brother that they had
[1:43:00] lazarus was dead
[1:43:02] the family was devastated probably was
[1:43:05] the bread winner
[1:43:06] there was nothing good you know to write
[1:43:08] home about
[1:43:09] but they had still had faith maintain
[1:43:11] their faith in jesus
[1:43:12] jesus seemingly had disappointed them
[1:43:15] but men of god
[1:43:16] work with god that says the lord they
[1:43:18] walk by the discretion of the lord
[1:43:20] amen maybe you invite your pastor to
[1:43:22] come and pray for you
[1:43:23] and it doesn't come it doesn't mean your
[1:43:25] pastor doesn't love you
[1:43:26] he has to he also got a master he has to
[1:43:29] follow the lead not the master
[1:43:31] just like jesus almighty god he just
[1:43:33] doesn't do things anyhow
[1:43:35] but he said the father the son does not
[1:43:37] do nothing of himself
[1:43:38] but what you see that father doeth
[1:43:40] likewise with the son
[1:43:42] so jesus doesn't do things because you
[1:43:44] want him to do it
[1:43:45] he does it when the leadership of the
[1:43:47] holy ghost in him tells me to do it
[1:43:49] you might want your pastor to do
[1:43:50] something but that might not be the
[1:43:52] leadership not the time and season
[1:43:54] he might tarry he might not even do it
[1:43:56] at all he must oh i invited a jack for
[1:43:58] this oh i told him to do this for me
[1:44:00] he's supposed to do this for me but he
[1:44:01] didn't do it the lord has to lead him to
[1:44:04] do what he's supposed to do
[1:44:06] because he's also got their boss so he
[1:44:08] has to follow the inspection of the boss
[1:44:10] glory hallelujah so jesus didn't come
[1:44:13] when they invited him to come and pray
[1:44:14] for lazarus
[1:44:15] about how many times they send
[1:44:16] messengers
[1:44:18] cell phone text him test brother jack
[1:44:20] call him
[1:44:21] tell sister rick i call the children
[1:44:23] turbo jack i'm sick
[1:44:24] but that doesn't show up cobra jack
[1:44:26] email everything so i don't even know
[1:44:28] this my pastor doesn't love me doesn't
[1:44:30] care about me i've seen everything i've
[1:44:32] informed his family
[1:44:33] everybody he doesn't come in he didn't
[1:44:34] even come and pray for me but his boss
[1:44:37] is showing him something much greater
[1:44:39] than praying for for your situation
[1:44:41] so at the right time when the person is
[1:44:43] dead at the west
[1:44:44] west situation that's when you show up
[1:44:47] if it were to you and now would you do
[1:44:49] you might kick him out
[1:44:50] what are you coming to do when you watch
[1:44:52] my only brother to die you are coming
[1:44:54] for his funeral
[1:44:55] and you claim yourself to be a prophet
[1:44:56] you claim yourself to be my pastor
[1:44:58] you waited for my brother to die and you
[1:45:00] are coming for a full man come and come
[1:45:01] and celebrate the funeral
[1:45:02] you might be a witch that's why they
[1:45:04] call you a bit visible
[1:45:06] you might probably end draw that
[1:45:08] conclusion that really we are following
[1:45:09] a false
[1:45:10] false prophet moses didn't do this but
[1:45:13] there's something going on
[1:45:15] and when he came they were crying they
[1:45:16] didn't lose faith in christ
[1:45:18] even they hadn't said lord if i'd been
[1:45:20] here my brother wouldn't have died
[1:45:22] and even at this at this hour if you
[1:45:23] speak we know even now
[1:45:26] even now the lord can do something and
[1:45:29] they had faith they went to call his
[1:45:30] sister
[1:45:31] mary and they followed the lord people
[1:45:34] were weeping in mourning
[1:45:35] and then they went to they said let's go
[1:45:37] to the cemetery say lord they went and
[1:45:39] they said
[1:45:41] their barrier system was different they
[1:45:42] put them in a stone put a big rock on
[1:45:44] on it they kind of put them in a in a
[1:45:47] garment
[1:45:48] i mean stranded them whatever wound them
[1:45:51] around with ropes and whatever
[1:45:53] and they used to have an embalming uh
[1:45:55] cream
[1:45:56] and ointment so that the body doesn't
[1:45:58] smell
[1:45:59] and the sister said no lord this time
[1:46:02] four days my brother's nose
[1:46:04] is caved in i don't want to see my
[1:46:05] brother in that situation
[1:46:07] he said but you believe do you believe
[1:46:10] and now he went to she went to future
[1:46:11] stamata said
[1:46:12] i know in the resurrection my brother
[1:46:15] woe
[1:46:16] shall future arise when the resurrection
[1:46:19] is standing before her
[1:46:20] she is pointing to resurrection
[1:46:21] somewhere amen when you have christ in
[1:46:24] you you you're appointed to resurrection
[1:46:26] somewhere he said i am the resurrection
[1:46:29] and life if you believe in me
[1:46:32] and so he the lord raised their faith
[1:46:35] and then said take the
[1:46:37] she put them he put them to work they
[1:46:39] were sisters they said take the stone
[1:46:40] away
[1:46:41] because you become partakers of it
[1:46:43] you're going to be serious

[1:48:36] let's go to the 11th we're getting
[1:48:37] closer
[1:48:40] broken nets fishermen broken net and
[1:48:44] broken ships
[1:48:47] these people went to fish they didn't
[1:48:50] catch nothing
[1:48:51] they fished on the wrong side of the sea
[1:48:54] all night
[1:48:55] all day long they came they wouldn't
[1:48:57] even get a piece of fish to use it for
[1:48:59] their food
[1:49:00] for their tacos and for their bread and
[1:49:02] for whatever
[1:49:04] but now when the lord came in he said
[1:49:06] take your net
[1:49:07] and cast it on this side the lord always
[1:49:10] wants you to use faith
[1:49:12] peter was was one of the biggest
[1:49:14] fishermen and he know
[1:49:16] everything about seashore about fishing
[1:49:20] so you know where the fish is where you
[1:49:21] can get a school of fish
[1:49:23] they've tried everywhere they couldn't
[1:49:25] even get one piece of fish
[1:49:26] so peter said well lord i know we've
[1:49:29] taught all night
[1:49:31] maybe 24 24 hours not even a little
[1:49:34] piece of fish
[1:49:35] but at that word at that command
[1:49:39] right i believe i i seek
[1:49:43] i receive amen
[1:49:46] and then peter threw his net at the
[1:49:47] right side and he came with multitude of
[1:49:49] fish
[1:49:50] to death the net was breaking they have
[1:49:52] to call others to come and help them
[1:49:55] when you get abandoned you give some to
[1:49:57] others
[1:49:58] amen don't be me my and myself
[1:50:02] but eternal life is living for others
[1:50:05] when the lord has blessed you as we

[1:50:09] grace unto others
[1:50:11] encourage others people are hurting
[1:50:13] people are going through difficult times
[1:50:15] it could be something it could be a word

[1:50:20] you it could be a sincere i love you
[1:50:22] from your heart
[1:50:24] maybe you're a woman somebody's hurting

[1:50:28] whoever
[1:50:29] co-worker to let them know that you love
[1:50:31] them they are going through something
[1:50:32] you pray for them
[1:50:34] from their hearts not from their mind if
[1:50:36] you speak it from their mind it just
[1:50:37] goes into the thin
[1:50:38] air but if it's from the heart the heart
[1:50:40] is where the lord lives
[1:50:42] it will make a difference in their life
[1:50:45] amen
[1:50:46] because words are life and they are
[1:50:47] death if it's well spoken it brings life
[1:50:51] just like we said you've got a power and
[1:50:53] you want to use the power for evil you
[1:50:54] can use it for evil

[1:51:10] amen glory hallelujah
[1:51:15] and uh john 2 21
[1:51:18] 8-13 and the other disciples came in
[1:51:22] on a little ship for they were not far
[1:51:24] from land but as it were 200 cubits
[1:51:26] dragging the net with the fishes
[1:51:28] and as soon as they were come to land
[1:51:29] they saw a fire of coals there and fish
[1:51:33] and fish lay there there and bread and
[1:51:35] jesus said unto them bring
[1:51:36] of the fish which you have now caught
[1:51:39] salmon peter went up and drew the net to
[1:51:41] the land full of great fishes
[1:51:43] and 150 and three for all there were so
[1:51:46] many

[1:51:54] and now that and none of the disciples
[1:51:56] did ask him
[1:51:58] who are thou knowing that it was the
[1:52:00] lord jesus then cometh
[1:52:02] and take a bread and give it them and
[1:52:04] fish likewise
[1:52:06] when you come to jesus table commander
[1:52:08] there's a song that goes like
[1:52:10] jesus and city will spread where the
[1:52:13] saints of god are fed
[1:52:15] he invited his children people come and
[1:52:17] dine

[1:52:39] water into wine
[1:52:46] so if you are hungry come to jesus table
[1:52:48] amen
[1:52:49] and the last one about the broken ship
[1:52:53] acts chapter 27 31 to 40 41.
[1:52:58] that's the last one paul was a prophet
[1:53:00] of god
[1:53:02] and he was going to pray the gospel and
[1:53:04] then the lord was with him
[1:53:06] he showed him that it was going to be a
[1:53:08] disaster there was going to be an
[1:53:10] incident
[1:53:10] our accident about a ship but if the
[1:53:14] people stay on the ship
[1:53:16] no life will perish so so paul
[1:53:19] told them to stay on on the ship and
[1:53:21] let's read it a little bit
[1:53:22] let's read have some reading let's read
[1:53:24] from 41 to
[1:53:26] 44. acts chapter 27
[1:53:29] you can read the whole story from 31 to
[1:53:31] 41 but let's read from 41 to
[1:53:33] 44 and falling into places where the two
[1:53:37] seats met they ran
[1:53:38] the ship aground and their fall
[1:53:41] apart stuck first and remained unmovable
[1:53:45] but the hinder part of hinapat was
[1:53:47] broken with the violence of the world of
[1:53:49] the whips
[1:53:50] and the soldiers council was to kill the
[1:53:52] prisoners lest any of them should swim
[1:53:54] out
[1:53:54] and escape but a centurion willing to
[1:53:57] save paul
[1:53:58] kept them from their purpose and
[1:54:00] commanded that they could swim
[1:54:03] they could swim should cast themselves
[1:54:05] into the sea
[1:54:06] and go to the land and the rest some on
[1:54:09] board some unbroken pieces of ship
[1:54:11] and so it came to pass that they escaped
[1:54:14] all
[1:54:14] safe to the land a man the ship of
[1:54:18] christ the old ship of zion
[1:54:20] may look broken and old but if you stay
[1:54:22] on that ship
[1:54:24] the gospel ship when corona came yes we
[1:54:27] know
[1:54:27] things were happening but if you stay on
[1:54:29] the ship
[1:54:30] the word if i apply the word they're
[1:54:33] talking onto your family
[1:54:35] everything will be okay amen things
[1:54:38] might go
[1:54:39] higgly piglety things will go here and
[1:54:41] there but if you stay on the ship
[1:54:43] focus on christ you land safely amen
[1:54:47] because the lord he's in control of
[1:54:50] everything
[1:54:51] before corona chris jesus is alive
[1:54:54] he's alive during corona and will be
[1:54:56] alive after corona
[1:54:58] he's the one who controls he sent an
[1:55:00] angel on the earth
[1:55:02] to allow these things to happen because
[1:55:04] the universe is for him
[1:55:05] it's not for the president of russia
[1:55:07] it's not for putin it's not for
[1:55:09] trump it's not for any of those
