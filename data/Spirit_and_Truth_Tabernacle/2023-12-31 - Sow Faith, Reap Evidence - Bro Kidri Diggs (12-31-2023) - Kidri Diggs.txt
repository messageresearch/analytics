waiting to slam something down on the devil Hallelujah and If I Lose I'm going to turn the whole table over hallelujah amen Mark chapter 5 praise God let's go to um verse 24 and then we going to go to Hebrews chapter 11 Mark 5 verse 24 and Jesus went with him and much people followed him and thronged him and a certain woman which had an issue of blood 12 years and had suffered many things of many Physicians and had spent all that she had and was nothing better but grew worse look at that went to the doctors she know she sought out all these people for help for 12 years and she didn't grow better she went she got worse and and verse 27 when she had heard of Jesus came in the press behind and touch his garments for she said if I may touch but his clothes I Shall Behold and straight way the Fountain of her blood was dried up and she went in her and she felt in her body that she was healed of the plague and Jesus immediately knowing in himself that virtue had gone out of him turned him about in the press and said who touch my clothes Hebrews chapter 11 Hebrews chapter 11 let's start at verse one the Bible says now Faith is the substance of things hope for the evidence of Things Not Seen for by the elders obtain a good report through faith we understand that the worlds were framed by the word of God so that things which are seen were not made of things which do appear by faith Abel offered unto God a more excellent sacrifice than can by which he offered witness what by which he obtained witness that he was righteous God testifying of his gifts and by it he being dead yet speaketh by faith Enoch was translated that he should not see death and was not found because God had translated him for before his translation he had a testimony that he pleased God but without faith it is impossible to please him for he that cometh to God must believe that he is and he is that he is a rewarder of them that diligently seek Him amen may the Lord a bless the reading of his word you can have your seats by the grace of God today uh by the help of the Lord I want to use for a subject I think some something that we all are familiar with and and um we all want to see more of a manifestation of and today my my title is sow faith and reap evidence sow faith and reap evidence now when you think of sewing you think of the law of also reaping you don't sow not to reap so if we ask the question today what are you sewing amen some people sow Discord some people so hate some people so lies some people so so envy and Mischief all these things are being sold and you're going to reap that thing that you put out in the atmosphere but you know I don't want to talk to you about that because I don't believe that you're Hypocrites today Hallelujah you know I believe that we're sewing good things Hallelujah when it comes to God hallelujah I believe that there's some people here today showing love Hallelujah I believe that there are some people in here hallelujah sowing virtue Hallelujah sowing meekness and patience and Temperance the things of God the character of God you know when you when you get a song and you begin to worship you know that you are sowing in the spirit Hallelujah you're putting that out there Hallelujah and you have to receive that back in which you give out into the atmosphere now I'm not one of these people who say well I don't believe in God but I just believe in a higher power no Hallelujah I believe what you sow unto God you will reap Hallelujah because my sewing is not into the universe butn of nonsense h i put it out in the universe no uhuh uhuh your faith has a destination yes sir and what you put out there has a destination it's going to fall in somebody's life Hallelujah and it's going to bring forth something Hallelujah and evidence Hallelujah and you know you reap what you sow and you know let's just talk about the law of reaping and sewing before we go any further Hallelujah now to make this very very simple when we think of sewing what do we think of a farmer amen and what that farmer does is he gets a product Hallelujah he gets something that he wants to see more of Hallelujah Hallelujah he not just planting just to be planted no he want more of what he's planted he want more of what he had Hallelujah so he's going to get it in what seed [Music] for Hallelujah to get more of what he desires he has to get it in seed form and then once he get it in seeds form he has to find somewhere to plant it he can't just plant it anywhere he has to plant it in a place where it can bring forth his [Applause] desire W Hallelujah he has to plant it in a place that he believes Hallelujah under the right or correct circumstances it will come forth Hallelujah so what does he do he he gets that seed and and he unveils it and uh he does it now catch us now Hallelujah when he buys that seed he doesn't have to add anything to it hallelujah hallelujah he takes the seed he finds the proper ground and then he plants the seed but after he SWS the seed what comes next the element of Faith Hallelujah so he has to depend on Hallelujah the place where he planted he has to depend on the elements around it he has to depend on things that he cannot control Hallelujah that's what the farmer does he has as he SWS the seed he also has to step back into faith and depend on things that he cannot control he cannot control how much the sun will [Music] shine but he has to trust that when it shines it will be enough for what he planted woo hallelujah oh my church what are you say I'm saying you just s and believe that when the sun begins to shine not the S you in but the s o in it'll be more than enough to bring forth that life inside of you that he is already planted Lord he has to depend on the conditions of the earth Hallelujah he don't know Hallelujah whether there'll be a frost in the morning but he's trusting Hallelujah that he's planting the seed in the right season come on somebody he's trusting Why what is he doing he's planting it how by Revelation he's planting the seed Hallelujah by what he know should takes place because he's been there before Hallelujah church when it comes to us we're not the first ones God's ever dealt with Hallelujah he's giv people before us a word in their Day based upon certain situations and conditions Hallelujah Church there were people who received the word in their day in more worse conditions than we have Hallelujah they received the word in a day when their heads were getting chopped off and we quit because somebody talking about us we quit because we tired of coming to a school bill church do you realize we got half or half of the New Testament from a man who did not have a church building to go to H it was a walk of faith and as he sold God helped him to reap the very thing he was sowing what was it lives into the kingdom amen oh my but there's a law of reaping and sewing the planter has to trust that whatever he planted will come forth in its season that's right Hallelujah see God doesn't give us a word out of season for those of you who don't believe God sent a prophet Hallelujah he did it in season Hallelujah for those of you who would catch it and be able to bring forth the inspiration that was in that seed Hallelujah but look at it Church sowing and reaping hallelujah what did you know even the prophet of God said he said that that that that that the planter the farmer he would plant the seed and he keep he can't keep coming back to it saying I want apples although he knows apples is there he can't come back the next day and say I want oranges although he knows is dead what does he do I'm going to wait on you I trust in your good good trust in your promise that's what we do Church Hallelujah we can't keep coming back Hallelujah saying Lord I don't see nothing I know I planted I know I didn't pray but I don't see nothing you got to trust that you sold in [Applause] faith faith can never fail Hallelujah faith is always on time and faith is strong enough Hallelujah to bust open any [Music] are hallelujah what you re what you saw because there is a law in reaping and sewing H my pastor used to say to us when we were younger when we were younger and different ones were courting and dating he would come and he would say sister B he' say hey to you young sisters he say let me tell you something if you sow the right thing you'll get the right thing but if you s the wrong thing you'll get the wrong thing and then we be like huh yeah pastor we know that and then he get down to what he's really saying sister ber he said Hey sisters if you sow yourself like a prostitute you'll get a [Applause] pimp brother that's a little too strong for a message Church no young people and people in here have the same Temptations as in the world get tired of waiting and see some nice looking young man remember what you sewing after and then he come to the brothers and he say listen here young man if you s yourself like a pimp you get a prostitute yes she'll be fine she'll be sexy but she'll love you Bobby Ricky and Mike you'll be they saying Cool It Now oh be so tall you get a inspiration like CL would you hear a song in your head [Music] go be ready for The Showdown because you chose the wrong way to S church I don't know how many how much clear I can make this everything in God's economy and if you are a part of God's com economy your life is a situation under control right he told Joshua be strong and of a good courage he told him when you go out there don't go out there weeping don't go out there afraid he said be strong and of a good courage cuz I've already given you the land I just want you to fight for it I want you to sow something Hallelujah I want you to put up my D and you going to reap the promise of what I gave you but you got to fight for we getting tired of fighting all right I don't know about y'all but I'm getting better Hallelujah that's right actually sometimes the devil can't even see me next thing you know boom he dead Hallelujah cuz I'm getting better at it Hallelujah he want me to fuss and be all wild complain no I just get on my knees and pray Hallelujah see church this is another kind of warfare see Church the better the longer something goes on the more it should mature and as that seed grows it gets stronger stronger stronger and stronger to the to the law inside of it begins to produce the life that's within it Hallelujah amen but I don't want to be too long today by the grace of God but when you think about Hallelujah the law there is a law Hallelujah in the kingdom of God there's a law on Earth and some of you may say well man this preacher he's kind of wild I never seen him before we like this all the [Applause] time it's just who we are amen thank you bro it's just who we are Hallelujah and you know we take a natural law there so you can follow me and you know for those of you who going hear me say these things you know this is in what we call our message H and the message is Jesus Christ Hallelujah and you know Church there's a law that God put inside of a bird and what is that law to be able to fly in any kind of condition yes sir y'all remember that year you had uh like four hurricanes in a row back to back 2008 n something like that you know I was down here one of them years I was down here when when when we did our first meeting with brother Westco he was it was brother Char the hurricane out there I remember his name was Hurricane dentist H and we were we were were uh had the meeting plan already and and we had to go to brother West CO church and everybody flew in and came in and I didn't drove and now there's a storm out there Hallelujah and the storm is out in Miami already Hallelujah and it's beating and beating and beating Miami and the and the winds are blowing to we can feel the winds up here in West Palm but did that stop the Saints from going around no y'all was still riding around going to the store going out to eat everything I'm looking at y'all like somebody crazy they don't know it's a hurricane idea but there was a level of faith in you guys that the hurricane couldn't stop the hurricane couldn't stop you Hallelujah from going to get that chicken the hurricane couldn't stop you from going to the gas station the hurricane couldn't stop you from fellowshipping with one another why because your faith was greater than what your eyes could see Hallelujah and you know that that that that that hurricane came and and you know it blew some things up and and then I got under the atmosphere you guys we and I said you know what if they ain't afraid why am I afraid Hallelujah I serve the same God they serve so I said you know what before I preach I'm going pray about this thing Hallelujah so before I preach I got on the pull pit and I said you know what I can feel the fear in the building hallelujah what happen in this church today if there was no fear if there was no fear in this place any and everything will become possible right now because when fear is gone Faith takes over Hallelujah yes cuz remember it was fear first Hallelujah before he spoke to the bull sir sir he wanted to sh the bull uhhuh yeah but God put him in a situation where he couldn't operate in his fears he said he wanted to shoot it but he had no gun and then he wanted to out run it but the F was too far so what did he had to do he had to fall in the atmosphere he said you know what now what what he going to do he said the only thing I can do is trust God so what did he do he sold Faith to godall he said Lord if my time to go I guess it's my time to go but I'm not going to die like a coward Hallelujah and as he had as he sold that unto God hallelujah and evidence of substance Hallelujah begin to be created right there in his atmosphere Hallelujah as he swed Faith Hallelujah in evidence of what he was swing came down in the atmosphere of controlling a b yes sir hallelujah hallelujah he sold faith and he reap the evidence to be able to control his surroundings yes by speaking love you want to see your family member save Hallelujah learn to adapt some love in your vocabulary our we know when we right we want to let everybody know we right we do that with our children you ain't going to tell me I'm older than you I'm grown I didn't been through it yeah you done been through it but now it's they turn I tell you one thing that got me really really saved I was going to church and participating and everything and but I didn't feel condemned by the Believers I'm not talking about in my own self yeah I felt condemned in my own self but the people I was fellowshipping with they never made me feel condemned by how they handled me my mama loved on me Hallelujah even though I was walking around with Jordans and and Gucci links and gold ropes and all that stuff on I was still a son and she loved me Hallelujah even when the pastor saw me he' be like hey boy how you you doing and he going by his business even though I didn't act a part or looked the part I felt love Hallelujah if you s the right thing you reap the evidence of what you sewing but we want to do it physically the farmer does not bring forth that seed physically it all comes forth by faith Hallelujah but look after all those hurricanes that we experienced back in the 2000s Hallelujah the sun came back out hallelujah amen the mang go came back on the trees the alligators was still in the swamp and you know what else the bird was still flying hallelujah what are you saying amen the conditions of the environment shouldn't change the law inside of you Hallelujah the things that happened in Florida it didn't do anything to that bird that was here in Florida some of those birds flew away cuz they could sense it by inspiration but when the storm was over they came back it might be time for somebody to come back you didn't been in the storm long enough it might be time for somebody to come back hallelujah look at your life ask yourself am I making progress or am I in the wilderness still going around the same you going to reap what you s I'mma Liv in evidence of that my God no I didn't always get it right the first time that's why I can speak on this cuz I got tired of getting whipped by God h well let's move on we understand that there's a law in a bird right is that law still working today talk to me church when you look at the bird what do you think about it can fly it doesn't even have to be explained this particular law Hallelujah your intellectual faith has nothing to do with it cuz you can't explain how a bird flies you just look at it and say I know it's true Hallelujah and it's the same thing with some of us we can't explain why we here all we know is that we still [Music] [Applause] here but you know one of my first trips I'm kind of going back just just to get you a law one of my first trips to South Africa I went to a safari you know a lion parking they had lions and cheaters and all these other things things and hyenas and all that but in this time they let the CB the baby lions you could come and get them and feed them and pet them and do all that now the teeth was still sharp now so you had to be careful cuz it still was a lion even in this baby stage Hallelujah but you know one thing I learned about that I looked at the lion and you know I begin to think about it and uh that little lion it'll come up to us you know we'll feed and everything and occasionally it'll look at you and it'll say what we call that we say that's a meow from a cat meow meow but to that lion that was a raw it don't change from a meow to a raw according to a li always was a raw but as it mature the sound of it Chang W and as you mature the sound of your prayer should change the sound of your walk should change the sound of your worship should change Hallelujah the sound of whatever you do your life should change you should go from a to something that could move [Music] trees that same baby lion Hallelujah I would pick it up and caress it and rub it I just came back Hallelujah I just went back again this year Hallelujah uh uh September went to the LI Park and that same little c is now like this 9 foot long now you think I want to pet it my faith ain't in the same place why because now I want you to catch this now it's still the same creature but what's happening now is when I once pet it why can't I pet it now because I'm Living Through My Five Senses Hallelujah that's the only reason why I can't pet it right because my five senses is telling me D ain't a baby Lon my five sister can telling me it like to eat meat my five sister telling me you ain't supposed to touch no lion but according to what's in my seed Hallelujah when I was created the lion bow down to me and the only way I get back to that place is if I believe in what God says I am Hallelujah and if I can get to the place to where I believe what God says I am I could be able to walk up to that lion and say hey sit and be quiet but the only way you're going to get there Hallelujah if you live through another CEO in the building Hallelujah and your eyes are not the CEO your ears are not the CEO your touch your taste is not CEO but what you can believe should be controlling your walk Hallelujah god well we reaping and we reaping and you know that same lion H you go back to the park that meow now it can go for five miles H that meow now is so loud that it makes the trainer say okay y'all I think it's time for us to go when years before the trainer say come on you can p one let's P it let's play it and now Hallelujah things have changed yes sir you see how important it is for you us we not to let our Five Sisters control our walk okay but that law is in that lion hallu to Roar to hunt to do all these things is in it seed now if we can see if we can agree that there's a law in a bird talk toy this ain't no insurance seminar I ain't looking for NDS Hallelujah we in church and in church we say Amen in church we say hallelujah this ain't no this ain't no Geico beating when you not sure what I'm giving out you should be sure of what I'm talking about ain't no hidden secrets in the ca that I'mma get you for something no you should know what I'm talking about Hallelujah listen now that lion has a law that bird has a law everything God created had a law inside of it so when he created us shouldn't there be a law inside of us hallah what is that law in us that law of Faith am that law to believe in things that we cannot see without your eyes but we know it's there Hallelujah whether you realize it or not that law is working in this room right now Hallelujah the law of a present theophany is in this room hallelujah it's not your flesh saying amen no hallelujah it's the creation of that word body agreeing with the word by faith saying amen hallelujah amen church now we understand that there is a law in US sir Hallelujah there's a law in us to understand God there's a law in us to hear God there's a law in us to see God and there's also a law in us to want more of godall you're not thirsting for the things of the world no you're really thirsting for the true creation of God you're thirsting for the real Joy of God the real love of God the real peace of God that's what thirsting for but listen but D what are you saying I'm saying right here in spirit in truth Tabernacle there is a measure of perfect Faith it's in here yes sir sir I don't know okay I want you to help me with this on faith comes by hearing of the word now let me ask you something how long you been hearing the word I know I hav been here maybe three times this year and I didn't seen some of y'all three times this year in church hearing what the word hallelujah you have a service on Wednesday you have prayer Friday right don't you have prayer something something go on on Friday you know prayers meeting Sisters Meeting you have service on Sunday so at least two times a week you're getting preaching in church I Know Jack ain't preaching about Geico I know brother smile ain't preached about Geico or brother Char preached about Geico no what are they preaching somebody tell me what they preaching what are they preaching so you should have what faith you should have faith cuz faith comes by hearing hearing what oh boy I set you up real good just now there's no excuse for you not to believe there's no excuse for your prayers not to be answered cuz you've been hearing the word oh you lordone some of y'all been hear the word for yes oh my yes sir we can go back on some of y'all at least 20 years you've been hearing the word so where is your perfect Faith cuz the more you hear it the more you should become what you're hearing that's right right we got sisters in our church who are nurses they don't always remain floor nurses because as they stay on the job the better they get the better their skills get and as new people come along they have to move them up higher Hallelujah but some of y'all have been here for years and years and years and years still saying to God lord increase my faith oh Lord are you not hearing the word let's say it again faith comes by hearing hearing of the word all right so there should be a measure of faith in this place in this church let's take it at the church in your house because when you leave here what do you take with you the word oh my I feel like I'm running out of time oh my faith CU by hear hear of the word of God and and and and and the word says in Hebrews he says without faith it is impossible to please God why because God is the word hallelujah okay now we can establish Hallelujah that the word is being preached here but then the prophet of God he preached the message Hallelujah called perfect Faith Hallelujah why is the word in faith fa going together Hallelujah because it's the word that stimulates your faith you ever heard she you ever heard the preacher preach on something you say I believe that your walk get a little bit more sturdy I believe that and I'm going to produce that why because you become one with what you've heard and not only that you hearing it Hallelujah you hearing it Hallelujah that word word hallelujah it begins to stir up something that's inside of you the reason why we are here because we heard what A word Glory listen Okay well let's understand what's been happening to you if you go say well brother I ain't been here all the time like you talking about well let's just take 2023 all what's been happening to you while you've been sitting here from January 1st 2023 to right now December 31st 2023 what's been happening to you as you've been hearing the word what should have been happening you should have been receiving some stimulation yes sir Hallelujah stimulation from what Revelation because faith is a what revelation hey I don't care what the devil been saying don't y'all put this message down this message is your get out of jail free [Music] car cuz even when we do wrong God give us a word to get us back in Step yes sir and I have done things in 2023 that I'm not proud of but God is faithful he come he continues he comes to my cell and he said don't worry about it son you going to go freeall boy walk by the jail I said boy you locked up I say not for long not for long I got freedom inside my seat I got worship inside my seat I got joy in my seat Hallelujah don't let the the devil listen oh on couple years ago I was going through something I started to get depressed yeah and a brother this is this is kind of what I'm about to say is kind of the meat of my message a brother he called me and he said hey he said I know that you were sitting in the back of the church he said I know that's not you all right he said whatever you going through you a got to tell me you got to tell nobody but whatever you going through don't let the devil steal your Joy cuz once he steal your joy Hallelujah he'll send you out there in the world and what you think going to bring you real happiness is only there to destroy you right tall dark and handsome to destroy you peti sexy to destroy you because what the enemy is doing he's working on your emotions and real faith has nothing to do with your emotions the gospel of Christ has nothing to do with your emotions we don't live by our emotions we live by what's been revealed sir but listen what's been happening all this time the whole year and if you didn't miss the whole year shame on you now it's time to get back where you belong listen I'm going to show you how important this is you take all the things that I've been saying I don't know none of you really I know your faces and and different ones and we call each other family and we love on one another but I don't personally know your life I don't personally know your struggles so if I'm saying something that's hitting you that's God's telling you I love you oh you thought it was the devil no it's God it's God letting you know that he loves you so much he's trying to get you out of error he's trying to pull you back into the solid foundation and you get mad at me no it's God he loves [Applause] you I'm sick of waiting I'm sick don't be sick of it all right H listen so for the whole year we've been hearing what the word Jack going to be proud of y'all we've been hearing the word word but when we hear the word what's been happening the word comes to stimulate our faith that's right to stimulate something means what to excite to activity so when you hear the word it should produce an Awakening it should make something become more real to you it should awaken something that's already down there in that seed Hallelujah that's why sometimes you get so excited you dig up the carpet all right all [Music] right see some of y'all wasn't here for that but these are the kind of things that goes on when you get stimulated Hallelujah some people get stimulated Hallelujah they tear up the church some people get stimulated Hallelujah they speak in tongues some people get stimulated they get on the piano some people get stimulated they sing and they worship some people get stimulated and they cry but it's the word exciting that which is already in you calling it to activate that's why we come to church we hear the word of God because it's the word hallelujah that what quickens the seed it's the word hallelujah so brother Jag and and different ministers what have they been doing they've been sewing hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah amen stimulate to excite or activate all growth it's a whole year you shouldn't be the same place you was at in January amen amen amen if you are you're not really taken to heart was being sold to you listen I'm GNA tell you how real it is you have to know what's been planted a friend of mine in London the UK she she she she planted a pear tree and then when when the pear got a certain size it's supposed to push out and produce right but year after year this big old tree wasn't pushing out no fruit so she went up to the tree and she said you know what I planted you because I wanted paars and if you know don't give me no pirs next season I'mma Cut You Down yeah you say she crazy she talking to a tree no she ain't all she's doing what's inside of her sea because Jesus talked to a tree Jesus walked up to a fig tree he said give me some figs Hallelujah and the tree couldn't respond so Jes said if you don't give it to me you ain't give it to nobody else now what happened in that moment that sister caught the inspiration of Christ for her day Hallelujah no she wasn't thinking about a fig tree but in that moment something stimulated her to speak as God would speak yes sir and she said if you don't give me no pants I'mma to cut you down next season when it was time she went out there and looked at the tree the tree was pushing PS out everywhere peirs were coming from everywhere why because the tree didn't want to die it had heard from his [Applause] master and that's what real fith will do real fith will call out that life that's laying there that's what we're trying to do this morning we're calling out that life that's laying down inside out of you and until this day that tree is still pushing our pass I've eaten some of them hallelujah sister Brown so many PS Hallelujah that some of the branches start breaking all right wow cuz somebody believed in who they was I hope you catching me now stimulation listen stimulation listen now I ain't going to be too much longer

storm all the stuff that brother B did we ain't talking about none of that we talking about for your life amen and me personally I don't look for squirrels being created cuz I'm not a hunter I don't

I got it it's only if you didn't did all of that Hallelujah if you didn't did all of that in the public God say faith is just as easy as all of that what else is there for you to do [Music] okay there was a woman with a blood issue for 12 years and this went on and on and on she went to physician went to all these people and the scripture says hujjah she went to these people and still wasn't made whole but then hallelujah the Bible says that she did what the same thing y'all doing she heard of Jesus yes sir now let me ask you something is her hearing any different from your hearing because she responding to what she heard about Jesus Christ and you're here because you're responding to what you heard about Jesus Christ amen but then let's take it a step further H something begins to tap into her and she says if I could just touch the him of his gar see to show your perfect Faith sometimes you have to tap into inspiration she didn't have a quote she didn't have a good message from a pastor Hallelujah she didn't have a prophet she didn't even have a Bible she just went off simply by what she heard and what she heard Hallelujah put her in a mode of inspiration to speak speak something Hallelujah that nobody else had ever did before Hallelujah so she said if I could just Touch the Hem of His Garment I'll be made whole what was she doing she was so in faith Hallelujah she put that out there where did it go it went straight to Jesus amen all right she said if I could just touch the him of His Garment I'll be made whole and not only did she think it it wasn't just an imagination she went and did it yes sir Hallelujah see it's not an imagination if you think it oh I'm about to say something heavy now it's not an imagination if you can think it you can do it woo if you can think it you can do it you just have to catch the inspiration for that moment Joshua thought about the sun being still and as he thought about it he spoke on it and as he spoke on it creation Hallelujah obeyed his [Applause] voice praise God oh my there so much in this and I ain't got the time because when you catch the right inspiration you tap into things that have already been done right Hallelujah now she's tapping into the inspiration Hallelujah for a blood issue God had it was always about blood right there was somebody else who tapped into a blood issue remember God told two boys two twins I want y'all to go worship today not with Mom and Daddy Kane and Abel and one thought it was about his imagination God's so pretty he's so nice I'm going go give him some fruit and then hallelujah Abel caught an inspiration of what blood yes sir and as he caught an inspiration it became a revelation Hallelujah to bring God on the scene hallelujah what was it doing what was able doing Hallelujah as he CAU the inspiration he was showing what God was going to do the lamb that was slain before the foundation of the world Jesus hadn't died on the cross yet Hallelujah but Abel's inspiration picked it up he killed the lamb for his sins just like Christ would do for you and I yes [Music] sir hallelujah oh my let's come on down to a close but listen she says if I could just touch the him of His Garment I'll be made whole what was happening she was sewing that's right what was she sewing Faith what was that Faith going to Christ that's right but it wasn't just a it wasn't just a get up and put on your shoe kind of Faith but this was the kind of faith that could create sir Hallelujah I don't know about y'all but I'm speaking over myself I'm I'm I'm creating how I want
