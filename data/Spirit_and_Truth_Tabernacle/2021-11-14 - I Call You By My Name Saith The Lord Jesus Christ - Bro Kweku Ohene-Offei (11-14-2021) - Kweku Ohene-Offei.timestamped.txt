[56:02] i call you by my name says the lord

[56:15] lord jesus christ amen the name of

[56:24] we have the same name before the
[56:25] foundation of the world we had only one
[56:27] name on earth we've got different names
[56:30] it's also part of our earthly
[56:32] manifestation but the true name that we
[56:34] have is the name of the lord jesus
[56:36] christ amen that name is that is common
[56:39] to all of us we are here because of that
[56:42] name we are not here because we are we
[56:44] belong to a certain society we are not
[56:46] here because we live in the same
[56:47] neighborhood maybe we might live in the

[56:51] the name of the lord jesus christ
[56:53] glory be to the lord let's um thank you

[57:05] a clap
[57:10] let's if you can be on our feet and pick
[57:12] our bibles
[57:13] and do some reading of the word of the
[57:15] lord
[57:17] let's read from
[57:23] let's first read from colossians
[57:29] chapter 3 verse 17.
[57:32] the book of colossians
[57:33] chapter 3 verse
[57:35] 17 is a very simple one scripture
[57:39] it says and whatsoever you did you do in
[57:41] word or indeed
[57:43] do all in the name of the lord jesus
[57:46] christ giving thanks to god and the
[57:48] father by him amen
[57:50] whatsoever you do in word or indeed do
[57:53] all in the name of the lord
[57:54] giving thanks to the father
[57:57] to god and the father by him amen
[58:00] we shall take our seat as we read other
[58:02] scriptures
[58:04] glory be to the lord
[58:08] let's go to um if we can let's go to
[58:17] let's go to our efficiency
[58:25] ephesians chapter 3
[58:27] and we will try to read
[58:29] verse 11 to 19
[58:32] ephesians 3 11 to 19.
[58:36] glory to the lord
[58:39] according to the eternal purpose which
[58:41] he purposed in christ jesus our lord
[58:43] in whom we have boldness and access with
[58:45] confidence by the faith of him
[58:48] wherefore i desire that you faint not at
[58:50] my tribulations for you which is your
[58:52] glory
[58:53] 14 for this course
[58:55] i bow my knees unto the father of our
[58:57] lord jesus christ of whom the whole
[59:00] family in heaven and in an earth is
[59:04] named
[59:05] of whom the whole family
[59:07] in heaven
[59:08] and in earth is named amen there's one
[59:12] name that pertained to earth first we
[59:14] said that there's one name that
[59:15] pertained to us that is a common name
[59:16] jesus christ that is on the earthly
[59:19] dimension but then we go we go to the
[59:21] celestial dimension it's one name that
[59:24] is the name of the lord jesus christ
[59:25] that pertain to the theophanies on the
[59:27] other side amen adapted into the angels
[59:31] that is the name of the lord jesus
[59:32] christ
[59:33] verse 16 said that he will grant you
[59:35] according to the riches of his glory to
[59:37] be strengthened with might by his spirit
[59:39] in the inner man that christ may dwell
[59:42] dwell in your hearts by faith that he
[59:46] being rooted and grounded in love may be
[59:48] able to comprehend with all sins what is
[59:50] their breath and length and death and
[59:53] height and to know the love of christ
[59:56] which passes knowledge that he may be
[59:58] filled with all the fullness of god amen
[1:00:01] our whole journey on earth here before
[1:00:02] the foundation of the world
[1:00:04] we were in christ
[1:00:06] and we are in christ and we forever and
[1:00:08] eternally be in christ
[1:00:10] before the foundation of the world we
[1:00:11] were in place that we didn't know about
[1:00:13] length and breadth and depth and height
[1:00:17] what is the length and breadth and depth
[1:00:20] and height that is the measurement that
[1:00:22] we go through
[1:00:23] in the sixth i mentioned there's nothing
[1:00:24] like
[1:00:25] birthday 20 years old there's not like
[1:00:28] 50th anniversary it doesn't exist
[1:00:30] there's nothing like i'm 100 years old
[1:00:33] you're always a tenner a man
[1:00:36] you don't grow old you don't grow young
[1:00:38] you are who you are
[1:00:40] amen
[1:00:41] but then we have to drop that glory and
[1:00:43] come here and measure height and breath
[1:00:45] and length
[1:00:46] and so on and so forth to measure death
[1:00:49] because in the celestial world
[1:00:51] death does not exist it's not a
[1:00:54] phenomenon you can find in heaven amen
[1:00:56] and it's right here but here we have
[1:00:58] death
[1:00:59] in the celestial world there's nothing
[1:01:01] like sickness
[1:01:02] there's not like grief
[1:01:04] and sorrow and crying
[1:01:06] it does not exist in the celestial
[1:01:07] dimension so we have to leave
[1:01:10] that glory behind and then come here and
[1:01:12] measure sickness
[1:01:14] height
[1:01:15] pains sorrow
[1:01:17] goodness life joy peace and so on and so
[1:01:21] forth amen because we wanted to learn
[1:01:24] all those attributes were in us as
[1:01:26] eternal attribute but we wanted to
[1:01:28] manifest them here in earth glory be to
[1:01:31] the lord jesus christ
[1:01:33] blessed be the name let's go to another
[1:01:35] scripture
[1:01:36] i want to see and try and do all the
[1:01:37] scripture reading before i start let's
[1:01:39] go to isaiah chapter 45
[1:01:42] verse 1 to 7
[1:01:44] isaiah 45 1-7
[1:01:49] he said but now that says the lord god
[1:01:52] that created thee oh jacob
[1:01:54] and he that formed thee o israel so his
[1:01:57] name was jacob
[1:01:59] and his name was chained to israel
[1:02:01] amen it's a fear not for i have redeemed
[1:02:04] thee i have called thee by thy name
[1:02:07] thou art mine
[1:02:09] and thy name is jesus jehovah
[1:02:11] verse two said when thou passes through
[1:02:13] the waters i will be with you
[1:02:15] and through the rivers
[1:02:17] they shall not overcome thee
[1:02:19] when thou walkers through the fire thou
[1:02:21] shall not be burned neither shall
[1:02:23] neither shall the flame kindle upon thee
[1:02:26] what is the water
[1:02:27] jacob mother pass through waters but
[1:02:29] waters are you passing through
[1:02:32] the waters are not waters are people and
[1:02:34] people carry spirits
[1:02:36] amen
[1:02:37] sometimes when you go to the woods areas
[1:02:39] by yourself you don't encounter spirits
[1:02:42] but you go to the city center you go to
[1:02:46] down downtown or your workplace
[1:02:49] then you begin to encounter spirits amen
[1:02:52] demons because people trees don't carry
[1:02:54] spirits no
[1:02:58] microphone doesn't carry spirits
[1:03:00] the sun doesn't carry spirits
[1:03:02] they are the way the lord created them
[1:03:04] amen but human beings carry spirits
[1:03:08] and when you enter encounter human
[1:03:10] beings you either encounter the spirit
[1:03:12] of the lord
[1:03:13] or the spirit of the of the devil amen
[1:03:17] so when you encounter you go through
[1:03:19] that you pass through the waters when
[1:03:20] you pass through the midst of people
[1:03:22] whatever you do your home your marriage
[1:03:25] your children
[1:03:26] your job your schooling whatever and the
[1:03:29] spirit that you encounter or even in
[1:03:31] yourself
[1:03:32] the lord said that
[1:03:34] he will you pass through those rivers
[1:03:36] and you come back on harm he's not going
[1:03:37] to drown you in other words the trials
[1:03:39] and afflictions of life if the lord has
[1:03:41] changed your name
[1:03:43] from jacob to israel then you are an
[1:03:45] overcomer amen
[1:03:48] if the lord has changed your name from
[1:03:49] kwaku to jesus christ then you have
[1:03:51] overcome
[1:03:53] amen your greatest my greatest enemy is
[1:03:55] not the person you want to shoot at me
[1:03:58] is myself
[1:03:59] so if the holy ghost overcomes me and i
[1:04:02] don't have any enemy i don't have any
[1:04:04] trouble whatever i pass through the
[1:04:06] demos the holy ghost is the one who
[1:04:08] overcomes amen that's why you should be
[1:04:10] named after the name of the lord jesus
[1:04:12] christ that is the only name that can
[1:04:14] help you to overcome your trials and
[1:04:15] tribulation
[1:04:17] without the name of the lord your name
[1:04:19] will not overcome nothing
[1:04:20] amen do not trump name couldn't overcome
[1:04:23] amen he wanted the second term but he
[1:04:25] couldn't amen
[1:04:27] was the name putin's name couldn't
[1:04:29] overcome nothing
[1:04:30] no name on earth can overcome nothing
[1:04:33] uh hitler's name couldn't overcome
[1:04:36] he was overcome
[1:04:38] amen by the name of jesus christ
[1:04:40] stands tall and to supreme it overcomes
[1:04:43] every condition every situation every
[1:04:46] life form every demon every catastrophe
[1:04:50] the name of jesus christ can overcome it
[1:04:52] for you amen that's why you have to get
[1:04:54] this name personally in your life by
[1:04:57] revelation of jesus christ personally to

[1:05:59] therefore i will give men for thee and
[1:06:02] people for their life fear not for i am
[1:06:04] with you

[1:06:08] gather thee from the west
[1:06:10] i will say to the north give up and to
[1:06:12] the south keep not back bring my sons
[1:06:15] from afar and my daughters from the ends
[1:06:17] of the of the earth even everyone that
[1:06:20] is called by my name for i have created
[1:06:23] him for my glory i form him yea
[1:06:26] i have made him amen
[1:06:33] your papa and your mama didn't make you
[1:06:35] the lord jesus christ made you
[1:06:38] your dad and your mom were the
[1:06:39] instrument through which you came to
[1:06:40] this earth the lord chose them but they
[1:06:43] didn't make you the one who made you is
[1:06:46] the lord jesus christ he formed you he
[1:06:48] put your substance in his book of life
[1:06:51] amen and that is what the lord sees he
[1:06:54] doesn't see the negative here but it
[1:06:56] sees your life that was wrote on the
[1:06:58] lamps written on the lamb's book of life
[1:07:00] the name of the lord jesus christ that
[1:07:02] is the name that he sees amen
[1:07:05] glory hallelujah to the lord
[1:07:10] let's go to one more scripture micah
[1:07:12] chapter 6 verse 4. i want to try as much
[1:07:14] as possible to do the bible reading then
[1:07:17] we go to what the lord has for us amen
[1:07:20] in the old old testament they used to
[1:07:22] read a scroll and they just close this
[1:07:24] and just bless the name of the lord for
[1:07:25] the reading of the lord is a blessing
[1:07:27] just in reading the word of the lord so
[1:07:29] mike 6 the book of micah
[1:07:32] chapter 6 verse 4
[1:07:35] for i brought thee out of the land of
[1:07:37] egypt
[1:07:38] and redeemed thee out of the house of
[1:07:41] of servants
[1:07:42] and i sent before thee moses aaron and
[1:07:46] miriam amen
[1:07:48] the lord was talking to israel that he
[1:07:50] brought them out of egypt that was the
[1:07:51] natural egypt and redeemed them from
[1:07:53] being being oppressed
[1:07:55] and he sent leaders who are the leaders
[1:07:57] moses who is moses moses was god himself
[1:08:01] because god said that whenever you see a
[1:08:03] prophet you see the lord jesus christ
[1:08:05] amen and when the lord called moses he
[1:08:07] said i've made you what god
[1:08:09] unto the people
[1:08:11] and i've made your brother aaron and
[1:08:12] who's aaron the prophet
[1:08:14] and who is miriam she's the prophet as
[1:08:17] the church amen so those were the three
[1:08:19] leaders the lord sent to israel the
[1:08:22] church the prophet and god almighty so
[1:08:25] moses aaron and miriam is a type of
[1:08:29] christ
[1:08:30] the prophet and a church amen remember
[1:08:33] what miriam did
[1:08:35] when the victory was one the people
[1:08:36] cross over miriam took what tambourine
[1:08:39] and she began to praise the name of the
[1:08:41] lord leading the women amen so that
[1:08:43] women have got leadership in them too
[1:08:45] amen it's not that it's not a puppet
[1:08:48] that makes you a leader it's what the
[1:08:50] lord has put in you it's what the lord
[1:08:52] has inscribed in you that brings the
[1:08:54] leadership of the holy ghost in your
[1:08:55] life amen so don't worry about the
[1:08:57] pulpit amen but worry about christ the
[1:09:00] puppet on your heart
[1:09:01] your prayer amen
[1:09:03] your your your dedication to the lord
[1:09:06] your consecration unto the word of the
[1:09:08] lord that has the leadership of christ
[1:09:10] that manifests the leadership of the
[1:09:12] holy ghost in your life amen it's not a
[1:09:14] pulpit that preaches
[1:09:16] it's not it's not a computer that
[1:09:17] preaches but it's the christ in brother
[1:09:19] brother but uh smiley amen christ in
[1:09:22] brother but a troy christian brother
[1:09:24] solomon christ in my brothers and
[1:09:26] sisters amen that is the leadership so
[1:09:29] the lord has brought thee out of egypt
[1:09:31] and he has redeemed you
[1:09:33] so that you can understand the height
[1:09:35] the breath and the length amen glory
[1:09:38] let's take another reading
[1:09:40] uh revelation chapter 3 verse 11 and 12.
[1:09:44] revelation 3 11 and 12 and we trust the
[1:09:47] lord will speak to us the lord blessed
[1:09:49] by the jack for last week
[1:09:50] between here and there the lord will say
[1:09:52] something amen
[1:09:54] between here and there the lord will
[1:09:55] meet you at your condition
[1:09:57] between here and there you meet the name
[1:09:59] of jesus christ
[1:10:01] between your breath and your death the
[1:10:03] name of the lord jesus christ we review
[1:10:04] to you amen between here and there the
[1:10:08] lord will will meet you there amen meet
[1:10:10] you here i'll meet you there
[1:10:12] glory hallelujah amen
[1:10:17] glory hallelujah blessed be the name of
[1:10:19] the lord so revelation 3 11 and 12
[1:10:24] revelation 3 11 and 12. behold
[1:10:28] i come quickly hold
[1:10:30] fast hold that fast which thou hast
[1:10:34] that no man take thy crown
[1:10:37] him that overcometh will i make a pillar
[1:10:39] in the temple of my god and he shall go
[1:10:42] no more out and i will write upon him i
[1:10:45] write upon him the name of my god and
[1:10:47] the name of the city of my god which is
[1:10:49] new jerusalem which cometh down out of
[1:10:51] heaven from my god and i will write upon
[1:10:54] him my new name
[1:10:56] glory hallelujah to the lord the lord
[1:10:58] will write his name upon you
[1:11:00] blessed be the name of the lord amen
[1:11:03] so let's see what is the name
[1:11:05] i think at the last time i preached we
[1:11:07] define a name a name
[1:11:09] is an attribute a name is identification
[1:11:13] a name is actually a nature
[1:11:15] amen
[1:11:16] that's why jesus christ changed certain
[1:11:18] people's name
[1:11:19] in the bible he changed a soul's name to
[1:11:22] what to paul
[1:11:24] he changed uh it wasn't in peter before
[1:11:26] he was called peter it was called simon
[1:11:28] barjona bajona means son of jonah just
[1:11:32] like taking your your father's family
[1:11:33] name so salmon by jonah was changed what
[1:11:36] peter the rock
[1:11:38] peter the revelation because the lord
[1:11:40] was going to do something in his life
[1:11:42] peter was going to receive a new name a
[1:11:44] new nature
[1:11:45] that would turn him from being the old
[1:11:46] fisherman who used to kiss to be a
[1:11:49] fisher of men
[1:11:50] a man who's still funny when it's
[1:11:53] passing through the street even in
[1:11:55] shadow we heal the sick people amen
[1:11:58] glory hallelujah when you receive a new
[1:12:00] name the supernatural automatically
[1:12:02] follows your life
[1:12:04] it's just part of your life amen when
[1:12:06] you receive jesus christ you don't have
[1:12:08] to work it out you don't have to fake it
[1:12:10] you don't have to feign it it's just
[1:12:12] your natural self and that is who you
[1:12:15] are amen you are a name and the name is
[1:12:18] what jesus christ you are a nature of
[1:12:21] the living christ and that nature is
[1:12:23] supernatural that nature has got
[1:12:25] creative power in him that nature can
[1:12:27] bring things into existence and create
[1:12:29] things remove things out of existence
[1:12:31] amen that nature can speak cancer out of
[1:12:35] existence and that nature can bring
[1:12:36] healing into existence glory hallelujah
[1:12:39] what do you need this morning whatever
[1:12:41] you need it's in you already
[1:12:44] amen
[1:12:45] whatever you need at this hour that is
[1:12:48] new already and your faith brings it out
[1:12:52] amen the waters of life brings it out
[1:12:55] the word of god brings it out amen
[1:12:57] there's nothing that you need that is
[1:12:58] outside you
[1:13:00] so brother i don't have money the money
[1:13:02] is outside me it's in you already
[1:13:04] your faith has to bring if you want
[1:13:06] million or billion your faith will bring
[1:13:08] credit money into crea into existence
[1:13:11] amen
[1:13:13] in israel prophet i've got two principal
[1:13:16] features
[1:13:17] prophet of create can create things into
[1:13:19] existence and can speak things out of
[1:13:21] existence
[1:13:22] amen
[1:13:24] and so the same spirit of christ is in
[1:13:26] you
[1:13:26] and you can speak things into creation
[1:13:28] you can split the positives into
[1:13:30] creation and speak the negative out of
[1:13:32] your life
[1:13:33] glory hallelujah to the lord
[1:13:36] blessed be the name of the lord so let's
[1:13:38] see where did i get to
[1:13:39] okay isaiah 45 i think we've done read
[1:13:42] that one already so the lord is calling
[1:13:44] his children from the north from the
[1:13:46] south from the east nothing can hold a
[1:13:47] child of god
[1:13:49] the lord can let you go through certain
[1:13:50] things to lend a contrast
[1:13:52] to lend a breath of sin if you want to
[1:13:54] sin you can go to the deepest of hell
[1:13:57] you can do whatever you want to do you
[1:13:58] can smoke till cancer will take over
[1:14:01] your lungs
[1:14:02] and on your death bed
[1:14:04] if the lord called you by the name jesus
[1:14:07] christ
[1:14:08] death will not take you
[1:14:09] until he transformed your life
[1:14:11] amen
[1:14:13] there was a man i think in the days of
[1:14:16] the prophet but abraham
[1:14:17] he was a smoker and nobody wanted to
[1:14:19] baptize him for some reason this one was
[1:14:21] a smoker but he wanted to be baptized in
[1:14:23] the in the name of the lord jesus christ
[1:14:25] and all the preachers
[1:14:27] they were holier than now so nobody
[1:14:29] baptized this man
[1:14:30] he was moving from preacher to preacher
[1:14:32] nobody would like to baptize he said go
[1:14:34] quit smoking i'm not going to baptize
[1:14:35] you so he came to what abraham said but
[1:14:37] abraham nobody want to baptize me
[1:14:39] i i want to be baptized in the name of
[1:14:41] the lord but i smoke and ram said what
[1:14:43] has smoking got to do with baptism in
[1:14:45] the name of the lord jesus christ
[1:14:49] get
[1:14:51] get
[1:14:52] the person that is drowning from the
[1:14:54] water
[1:14:55] before you take the water out of his
[1:14:57] lungs
[1:14:58] but if you try to take the water once
[1:15:00] it's under embedded in water
[1:15:02] more water is going to be there so we
[1:15:04] just get him out of the water the rest
[1:15:06] will be taken care of amen
[1:15:08] so
[1:15:10] [Applause]
[1:15:14] so but abraham arranged to baptize him
[1:15:16] and he baptized him once he was a smoker
[1:15:20] and after he was baptized he was still
[1:15:21] smoking anyways i think his son-in-law i
[1:15:23] think if i'm right but brother who's uh
[1:15:25] father-in-law
[1:15:26] so he was sick at the hospital and he
[1:15:28] couldn't do what he smoking so he said
[1:15:30] but i would to go buy him cigarette and
[1:15:32] he met with the brahms and always
[1:15:34] how how are things that i'm going to
[1:15:36] buy cigarette for papa i think his name
[1:15:38] is papa you know he can't do with
[1:15:39] smoking it's okay
[1:15:41] take i think he gave him ten dollars or
[1:15:43] something tick and go buy himself a ram
[1:15:45] you don't made it you are kidding he
[1:15:46] said no i'm not gonna put the money in
[1:15:47] your pocket and take this money and go
[1:15:48] buy him his
[1:15:50] cigarette because when i was surprised
[1:15:52] he thought he was yes no you i'm not
[1:15:54] kidding so he gave it to him he went to
[1:15:56] buy a cigarette for him he went back to
[1:15:57] the hospital and said how come you came
[1:15:59] you came so early he said i met brother
[1:16:01] bill on the street and he gave him money
[1:16:03] to buy you your cigarettes
[1:16:04] and the man didn't smoke anymore
[1:16:11] he just didn't smoke anymore
[1:16:13] so let the lord have his way amen
[1:16:16] the lord knows how to work it better
[1:16:17] than you and i
[1:16:20] let the pillow fire have his way in the
[1:16:21] people amen
[1:16:23] he can do it better than what you can do
[1:16:26] if you try to do it you're going to
[1:16:27] create a caricature
[1:16:28] you're going to create a hypocrite
[1:16:30] you're going to create an actor
[1:16:32] you act perfectly like a saint but when
[1:16:35] he's away from you is there is the devil
[1:16:37] in chief amen but when the lord does
[1:16:40] said when the lord transformed the heart
[1:16:42] the lord has done it amen
[1:16:44] it's done and it's forever amen
[1:16:47] don't even try to do it to yourself
[1:16:49] but just commit it to him
[1:16:51] and he'll take care of every situation
[1:16:53] whatever you have in your life whatever
[1:16:55] you want to overcome whatever spirit you
[1:16:58] want to overcome the overcomer is in you
[1:17:00] and is that jesus christ in your heart
[1:17:02] and let him take control and everything
[1:17:04] will be situated
[1:17:06] glory hallelujah to the lord blessed be
[1:17:08] the name of the lord
[1:17:09] amen
[1:17:11] one time there was a man called we know
[1:17:13] him
[1:17:14] simon
[1:17:15] barjona would you know him as peter amen
[1:17:19] even when the lord called him jesus
[1:17:20] christ gave him power gave him authority
[1:17:23] to cast him on but he wasn't so
[1:17:25] converted
[1:17:27] his name had been changed
[1:17:28] from salmon by jonah to peter the rock
[1:17:31] the revelation he had a revelation
[1:17:34] but
[1:17:35] by jack said he has to have the faith
[1:17:37] you may have a faith to do healing you
[1:17:40] may have faith to do miracles but you
[1:17:42] have to have the faith
[1:17:44] what is the faith that is christ in you
[1:17:47] amen peter wasn't there yet the day of
[1:17:49] pentecost hasn't come yet so peter was
[1:17:51] still peter he was so uh someone by
[1:17:53] jonah
[1:17:54] but one day the lord changed him
[1:17:57] when the day of pentecost came
[1:17:59] and peter was born again the old person
[1:18:01] died out
[1:18:02] and another person christ jesus took
[1:18:05] over him amen
[1:18:08] and let's see what the lord some few
[1:18:09] things the lord did in his life
[1:18:12] this is the man who denied the lord how
[1:18:14] many times
[1:18:15] three times
[1:18:16] but at the day of pentecost
[1:18:19] peter was the one who declared
[1:18:21] that the lord has opened a new day
[1:18:23] a brand new day
[1:18:25] amen
[1:18:26] the pr the prophecies of the prophets
[1:18:28] were being fulfilled
[1:18:30] the prophecy of moses
[1:18:31] joel
[1:18:33] asia
[1:18:34] adam and all the prophets they were
[1:18:36] being fulfilled in jesus christ
[1:18:39] and peter was a prophet of that day
[1:18:41] because the word of the lord
[1:18:43] comes to the prophet amen
[1:18:45] let's read a little message from what is
[1:18:47] attraction on the mountain
[1:18:51] 65-0725 e
[1:18:55] 65-0725e paragraph 87
[1:18:59] another attraction on a mount
[1:19:02] was the day of pentacles when all of
[1:19:04] them was up there in a religious feast
[1:19:08] thought they had got rid of other
[1:19:09] fanatics they hadn't heard from them for
[1:19:12] 10 days
[1:19:13] all of a sudden like a beehive they
[1:19:15] broke out
[1:19:16] of the of the top of the building out
[1:19:18] into the streets screaming and carrying
[1:19:20] on 88. so what is this

[1:19:28] all are
[1:19:30] all these men drunk

[1:19:34] and a prophet stood among them
[1:19:37] as the order of a prophet should be and
[1:19:39] said ye men of israel
[1:19:41] and you that dwell in judea in jerusalem
[1:19:44] let this be known unto you and he came
[1:19:47] to my weights these are not drunk like
[1:19:49] you think they are but this is that
[1:19:51] which was spoken of of the lord through
[1:19:54] joel

[1:19:57] last days i'll pour i'll pour out my
[1:19:59] spirit upon all flesh

[1:20:04] when peter received the name of the lord
[1:20:06] jesus christ he wasn't the same old
[1:20:08] peter anymore he has been transformed
[1:20:11] amen heaven was living in him
[1:20:13] all the power of jesus christ was now
[1:20:16] laying peter amen and as a prophet he
[1:20:18] declared what the old prophet wrote
[1:20:21] about that what was going on is not
[1:20:23] being drunk it wasn't alcohol but it's
[1:20:26] jesus christ
[1:20:27] of nazareth who is revealing himself in
[1:20:30] the form of another ministry called the
[1:20:32] holy spirit ministry amen

[1:21:26] here i pray thee for the lord has sent
[1:21:28] me to bethel
[1:21:30] so take cognizance of battle as well we
[1:21:32] look at the meaning of bethel
[1:21:35] and elisha said unto him as the lord
[1:21:37] leaveth
[1:21:38] and as i so liveth i will not leave thee
[1:21:41] so they went down to bethel verse 3 and
[1:21:44] the sons of the prophet that were at
[1:21:46] bethel came forth to elijah and said
[1:21:48] unto him knowest doubt that the lord
[1:21:50] would take away thy master from the head
[1:21:52] today and he said ye
[1:21:55] i know i know it hold thy peace verse 4
[1:21:59] and elijah said unto him elisha tarry
[1:22:01] here i pray thee for the lord has sent
[1:22:03] me to jericho and we find the meaning of
[1:22:05] jericho and he said as the lord leaveth
[1:22:08] and as thy soul leaveth
[1:22:10] i'll not leave thee so they came to
[1:22:11] jericho
[1:22:12] and the sons of the prophet that where a
[1:22:14] jericho came to elisha and said unto him
[1:22:17] notice that that the lord knoweth thou
[1:22:20] that the lord will take away thy master
[1:22:22] from thy head today and he said yea i
[1:22:25] know it hold your peace
[1:22:27] you know the sounds of the prophet
[1:22:29] the trotters of life
[1:22:31] they will divide you from your route
[1:22:34] what are some of the distractions in
[1:22:36] your life
[1:22:38] things that distract you from the life
[1:22:39] the lord has laid before you
[1:22:42] you have to know what distracted from
[1:22:44] the from the path of righteousness and
[1:22:46] tell them to hold their peace
[1:22:49] amen
[1:22:52] let him just let him just chip in jesus
[1:22:53] one time preach and after preaching was
[1:22:55] going somewhere
[1:22:57] and the devil created a storm you know
[1:22:58] the devil can can use the nature he
[1:23:00] cannot create
[1:23:01] but he can also has god power he's been
[1:23:03] giving power over nature
[1:23:05] just like you a son of god has got power
[1:23:07] over nature
[1:23:08] so the devil created a storm
[1:23:10] on the on the sea on the river
[1:23:12] and he wanted to drown the son of god
[1:23:14] but the devil didn't know who he was
[1:23:16] playing he was playing with
[1:23:18] he could play with peter and and john
[1:23:20] and and martha because they were not
[1:23:22] baptized with the holy ghost yet
[1:23:24] they didn't have the name of jesus
[1:23:25] christ yet
[1:23:27] though they were cussing demons in the
[1:23:28] name but the name was not inscribed on
[1:23:30] their heart
[1:23:32] so he could scare them to death but when
[1:23:34] the master of circumstances rose up
[1:23:38] he told the storm peace be still
[1:23:41] and the storm obeyed him amen
[1:23:44] and you've got the same power in you
[1:23:47] as a daughter of god as a son of god
[1:23:50] that whatever storms whatever
[1:23:51] destruction
[1:23:52] sickness whatever it might be sin
[1:23:54] unbelief you've got the same authority
[1:23:57] from heaven from the almighty to speak
[1:24:01] to the situation
[1:24:02] and the situation will obey you amen
[1:24:05] glory hallelujah to the lord
[1:24:08] let's keep reading
[1:24:10] and let's see uh we go to verse
[1:24:13] verse five
[1:24:14] and the sons of the prophet
[1:24:16] okay we got verse six and elijah said
[1:24:18] unto him tarry here
[1:24:20] i pray thee for the lord has sent me to
[1:24:22] jordan and he said as as the lord
[1:24:25] leaveth and as i so leave it i will not
[1:24:27] leave thee and the two
[1:24:29] went on and 50 men of the sons of the
[1:24:31] prophet now 50
[1:24:33] and stood far off and they two stood by
[1:24:36] jordan and elijah took his mantle and
[1:24:38] wrapped it together and smoothed their
[1:24:40] waters and they were divided heather and
[1:24:42] thither so that the two went over on dry
[1:24:45] ground
[1:24:46] elijah was training elijah how to use
[1:24:49] the supernatural how to use the word to
[1:24:52] divide situation amen
[1:24:56] verse nine and it came to pass one it
[1:24:59] came to pass
[1:25:00] when they were gone over that elijah
[1:25:02] said unto elisha ask what i shall do for
[1:25:04] thee before i be taken away from thee
[1:25:07] and elisha said i pray thee let a double
[1:25:09] portion of thy spirit be upon me
[1:25:14] and he went from thence to mount camel
[1:25:17] oh sorry verse 10 and he said thou has
[1:25:20] asked a hard thing nevertheless if thou
[1:25:22] see me
[1:25:23] when i when i'm taking from thee it
[1:25:25] shall come to pass
[1:25:26] it shall it shall be unto you but if not
[1:25:29] it shall not be verse 11 and it came to
[1:25:31] pass
[1:25:32] as they still went on and talked that
[1:25:34] behold
[1:25:35] there appeared a child of fire and
[1:25:37] horses of fire
[1:25:39] and parted them both asanda and elijah
[1:25:42] went up by whirlwind into heaven and
[1:25:44] elisha saw it and he cried my father my
[1:25:47] father the chariot of israel and the
[1:25:50] horsemen thereof and he saw him no more
[1:25:52] and he took hold of his own clothes and
[1:25:55] ran them into two pieces and he took up
[1:25:58] also the mantle of elijah that fell from
[1:26:00] him and went back and stood by the bank
[1:26:03] of jordan
[1:26:04] now what does he mean when elijah took
[1:26:06] his rope and ran him into two pieces
[1:26:09] denying himself
[1:26:11] amen
[1:26:12] you can ascribe to christ and ascribe to
[1:26:16] the the the cosmos world
[1:26:19] you can't ascribe to christ and ascribe
[1:26:21] to jesus christ to the devil
[1:26:23] amen
[1:26:24] you you either go with satan
[1:26:27] and his kingdom or you go with christ
[1:26:29] and his kingdom
[1:26:31] and if you want to go with christ and
[1:26:32] his kingdom then you should be ready to
[1:26:34] deny yourself to do what elisha
[1:26:37] was a type of a wife of a bride of
[1:26:39] christ did
[1:26:40] in order to marry to the son of man in
[1:26:42] order to get a double portion he has to
[1:26:45] let his own name go
[1:26:46] he has to let his fame go he has to take
[1:26:49] off his own robe because his robe was
[1:26:51] all tattered rope
[1:26:53] it that he didn't have any power he
[1:26:55] didn't have the supernatural but the
[1:26:57] robe of elijah which is the rook of
[1:26:59] jesus christ had a supernatural in it
[1:27:01] amen so elijah rip his own cloth and put
[1:27:06] on elijah's mantle
[1:27:07] which is a type of the word of the lord
[1:27:08] deny yourself and take all the word of
[1:27:11] the lord into your heart and to bring
[1:27:13] situations that you want in your life
[1:27:15] amen
[1:27:16] glory hallelujah to the lord
[1:27:19] and if you read on if you read on elijah
[1:27:21] began to do miracles
[1:27:23] he used the same clothes when he was
[1:27:24] coming back
[1:27:25] remember jordan was waiting for him
[1:27:27] he got to jordan what did he do he took
[1:27:30] on elijah elijah's mantle on him
[1:27:32] and hid the waters and the waters opened
[1:27:34] for him
[1:27:35] the same word that did for jesus christ
[1:27:38] jesus of nazareth that calmed the storm
[1:27:41] yours might not be yours might not be a
[1:27:43] natural storm
[1:27:44] yours might be a storm of life
[1:27:46] trials sickness persecution family
[1:27:50] children husband wife whatever you are
[1:27:52] going through
[1:27:54] you've got the same power you've got the
[1:27:56] same authority to speak to hit the
[1:27:58] waters and the waters will obey you amen
[1:28:01] because the elements of earth are
[1:28:04] subject unto their creator
[1:28:06] the waters the earth the fire and the
[1:28:09] air all the four elements
[1:28:11] the principal element that control the
[1:28:13] earth is subject unto the son of god and
[1:28:15] so if the son of god is in you
[1:28:17] you are become the son of god amen
[1:28:20] you have become the lord jesus christ in
[1:28:22] manifestation and when you speak your
[1:28:25] word is as good as the lord jesus christ
[1:28:27] speaking
[1:28:32] glory to the lord
[1:28:35] you know there's a time for everything
[1:28:37] there's a time to follow
[1:28:39] and it's a time to lead and we do all of
[1:28:43] them in different situations amen
[1:28:45] there's a time you all you have to do is
[1:28:46] to follow
[1:28:47] and there's a time the lord will bring
[1:28:49] you from the ray to lead
[1:28:52] amen and it doesn't let you go by
[1:28:54] yourself he's in you during the
[1:28:56] leadership
[1:28:57] there's a song we sing we all sing it i
[1:28:59] have decided
[1:29:01] to follow jesus
[1:29:03] i have decided to follow jesus i have
[1:29:08] decided to follow jesus no turning back
[1:29:12] no turning back
[1:29:14] the cross before me in the world behind
[1:29:17] me
[1:29:18] the cross before me in the world behind
[1:29:20] me
[1:29:21] the cross before me in the world behind
[1:29:24] me
[1:29:25] no turning back no turning back
[1:29:29] so if you are following jesus christ
[1:29:30] what are you following him for
[1:29:32] that's my question
[1:29:36] do you just want to follow jesus christ
[1:29:37] and follow him all your life and just
[1:29:39] follow him
[1:29:40] and follow him and follow him nothing
[1:29:41] happening to you
[1:29:44] no communication with him
[1:29:47] who want to marry a husband
[1:29:49] and after your gorgeous wedding
[1:29:51] the husband said he doesn't talk to you
[1:29:52] you don't talk to him and sit in one
[1:29:54] corner of the house and he sit on
[1:29:56] another corner of the house and stay at
[1:29:58] each other go to work and come back and
[1:30:00] you don't even greet you just come and
[1:30:02] go to his room and you go to your room
[1:30:05] is it a relationship is it a marriage
[1:30:08] the natural types are spiritual
[1:30:10] the lord doesn't want a relationship
[1:30:11] that we don't talk to each other
[1:30:13] he wants to talk to you
[1:30:15] and he wants you to talk to him
[1:30:17] amen
[1:30:18] he wants you to be him amen
[1:30:20] that's why when you marry uh you marry a
[1:30:22] woman you put you give your name to the
[1:30:24] woman because your life is for the woman
[1:30:27] you are living for for her
[1:30:29] and the lord is living for who for you
[1:30:32] and that's why he's put his name in your
[1:30:33] heart
[1:30:34] amen
[1:30:35] and so you follow it's good to follow
[1:30:38] but there's a time you have to what get
[1:30:39] what you are following for
[1:30:41] you don't just follow jesus christ and
[1:30:43] follow and follow and follow you have to
[1:30:45] receive what you are following elijah
[1:30:48] has a motive and a reason for following
[1:30:49] elijah
[1:30:51] glory hallelujah who called elijah to
[1:30:53] begin with you don't have time to go to
[1:30:54] the scriptures but elijah called elisha
[1:30:58] when elijah elijah was a farmer with his
[1:31:00] people they were plowing and he was
[1:31:02] playing on the 12th uh
[1:31:04] horse what is the horse car or whatever
[1:31:06] you call it bullock
[1:31:08] behold elijah appeared and he said
[1:31:10] follow me
[1:31:11] and elijah follow him
[1:31:14] and elijah had a purpose for calling
[1:31:16] elisha
[1:31:17] because elijah knew he was he was going
[1:31:20] to be taken away
[1:31:21] by a whirlwind to the sixth dimension
[1:31:24] and there should be a prophet on the
[1:31:25] land
[1:31:26] to help the people to lead the people
[1:31:28] and elijah elijah was the one ordained
[1:31:31] but then elijah elijah has to go through
[1:31:33] training
[1:31:34] he has to forsake his air
[1:31:36] his
[1:31:37] career
[1:31:38] and then follow elijah
[1:31:40] and learn the things about elijah
[1:31:43] learned how elijah conducted himself
[1:31:45] he saw one thing about elijah with this
[1:31:47] mantle that this mantle could do
[1:31:50] supernatural
[1:31:51] just like the road of moses amen the
[1:31:54] lord can take anything in your life
[1:31:56] things that are not regarded things that
[1:31:58] are of no substance and the lord can use
[1:32:00] it mighty to overcome things amen
[1:32:03] the lord didn't use ak-47
[1:32:05] he didn't use a
[1:32:07] a nuclear weapon but he used a little
[1:32:09] slingshot catapult in the hand of what
[1:32:12] david to kill goliath amen the lord
[1:32:15] doesn't need a big faith just your
[1:32:17] little faith that you have in him
[1:32:19] if you nurture that fit with love
[1:32:22] with confidence that fit can overcome
[1:32:24] everything glory hallelujah
[1:32:28] so elijah
[1:32:29] was following elijah sorry elisha was
[1:32:32] following elijah
[1:32:33] to get a double portion
[1:32:36] of what elijah's anointing
[1:32:39] so elijah said the lord has called me i
[1:32:41] need to go to bethel so wait for me he
[1:32:43] said no i'm not going to tell you i'm
[1:32:44] going to go with you
[1:32:46] and that's pretty simple it was upon
[1:32:48] ruth
[1:32:49] when a naomi who was a prophetess and
[1:32:52] ruth the young the new church the young
[1:32:54] prophetess
[1:32:56] ruth said naomi said i'm going to you
[1:32:58] know where i am now there's nothing i
[1:33:00] can do for you
[1:33:01] my son is dead my husband is dead so go
[1:33:04] back home and look for another husband
[1:33:06] and say no i am going with you wherever
[1:33:08] you go i'll go with you your people will
[1:33:10] be my people
[1:33:11] where you die i'm going to die your what
[1:33:13] your food will be my food your god will
[1:33:15] be my god amen
[1:33:17] and a ruth had what she was looking for
[1:33:20] she wasn't just following an army but
[1:33:22] she was fooling army for a purpose for
[1:33:25] the lord of naomi amen so elijah elisha
[1:33:30] was following elijah for a divine
[1:33:32] purpose to get a double portion
[1:33:34] and let's look at the meaning of those
[1:33:37] cds let's see what they mean
[1:33:40] blessed be the name of the lord
[1:33:43] gilgal means circle of stones
[1:33:47] rolling away
[1:33:49] whirlwind chaff and stubble
[1:33:52] gilgam means stone
[1:33:54] where you circle where you make your
[1:33:55] decision thought that good through your
[1:33:57] mind
[1:33:58] you have to make a decision that's the
[1:34:00] beginning of the journey and bethel
[1:34:01] means house of l
[1:34:03] l means elohim christ
[1:34:06] house of god
[1:34:07] so when you make your decision where do
[1:34:09] you go you go to the house of god to
[1:34:12] receive the word the bread of life
[1:34:15] then jericho means fragrance city of
[1:34:17] palm trees but it's the lowest part of
[1:34:20] jordan
[1:34:21] jericho is the lowest part of israel
[1:34:23] when you go so low
[1:34:25] close to jordan you hit jericho
[1:34:28] so before you start the gen you get what
[1:34:30] you want you have to go solo
[1:34:32] you have to bow your knees to the lord
[1:34:34] you have to deny yourself
[1:34:36] so that the lord he will lift you up
[1:34:39] the bible said humble yourself when you
[1:34:41] humble yourself you'll be lifted but
[1:34:44] when you lift up yourself you're going
[1:34:45] to be abused
[1:34:47] amen so you start with humility you have
[1:34:49] to go to the lowest part
[1:34:52] and deny yourself
[1:34:53] and give your heart to the lord jesus
[1:34:55] christ and when you do that the lord
[1:34:57] will lift you up and give you double
[1:34:59] portion
[1:35:00] and jodha means descending flowing down
[1:35:04] freedom that comes after a long season
[1:35:06] of adversity or waiting
[1:35:08] watering place garden of god source of
[1:35:11] fertility amen when you deny yourself
[1:35:15] and you go to the house of the lord
[1:35:17] and you humble yourself
[1:35:19] the lord will
[1:35:20] give you the double portion and let's
[1:35:22] see how it applied to elijah and you see
[1:35:24] how it applies to our lives when elisha
[1:35:26] had a double portion had the mantle of
[1:35:28] elijah when he was coming back
[1:35:31] now after getting the fragrance getting
[1:35:33] the word you have to manifest the christ
[1:35:36] in you after following elijah and
[1:35:38] getting the mantle of elijah now you
[1:35:40] have to manifest you have to descend to
[1:35:42] the people amen to your family you have
[1:35:45] to apply the token upon your children
[1:35:47] you have to apply to your church you
[1:35:49] have to apply to your family you have to
[1:35:51] apply it to your neighbors you have to
[1:35:52] apply to whatever you can apply to even
[1:35:54] to your doctor and your cats amen if
[1:35:57] your dog is sick yes if your your dog
[1:35:59] needs divine healing the dog can get the
[1:36:01] vihealing if your cat in divinely the
[1:36:04] cat can get it if your children need
[1:36:05] divine healing it's for you if you need
[1:36:08] it it's for you so whatever you have let
[1:36:11] the word descend from your heart and be
[1:36:14] a manifestation
[1:36:15] don't keep the faith
[1:36:16] and store it here but let it be a
[1:36:18] blessing to people
[1:36:20] glory hallelujah to the lord
[1:36:22] just like elijah when he received the
[1:36:25] anointing of elijah
[1:36:26] he went back he tried it on jordan
[1:36:29] he said let if the god of elijah is
[1:36:30] alive then let this water apart
[1:36:34] and the water part and he walked through
[1:36:36] the on plain ground just as he saw
[1:36:38] elijah doing amen and whatever you read
[1:36:41] in the scriptures the promises and the
[1:36:42] blessings of the lord is not only for
[1:36:44] the people of oh no
[1:36:46] it's not only for william abraham
[1:36:48] it's for you it's for us
[1:36:50] those blessings are yours amen and just
[1:36:53] let your faith go into display why do we
[1:36:55] have certain difficulties in your life
[1:36:57] why does the lord allow adversities in
[1:37:00] our lives
[1:37:02] is it because he doesn't love you no
[1:37:04] because he loves you and he's put those
[1:37:07] powers in your heart and they want those
[1:37:09] powers to be manifest manifested
[1:37:11] a man just like a man and his wife the
[1:37:14] other if the man has trained his wife
[1:37:17] there are certain times when the
[1:37:18] children do something but the man
[1:37:20] doesn't talk the wife can discipline the
[1:37:22] kiss
[1:37:23] just like as the man would like to do
[1:37:25] amen christ has put his life in us
[1:37:28] he has put the word of god in us he's
[1:37:31] actually living in us
[1:37:32] and when there's any problem just name
[1:37:35] it the holy ghost in you should go into
[1:37:37] play should go into action to fix the
[1:37:40] problem amen so the lord the lord allows
[1:37:43] adversities in our lives so that the
[1:37:44] power of god will be made known in
[1:37:47] action in real time amen the lord is not
[1:37:50] a god of history

[1:37:58] of what reality
[1:37:59] is the same yesterday today and forever
[1:38:01] according to hebrews 13 8. so whenever
[1:38:03] situation arises the same holy ghost
[1:38:06] that feels a certain similar situation
[1:38:08] or same in the past the same christ can
[1:38:10] do for you amen so there's a time to

[1:38:15] think we as a body of christ
[1:38:17] we becoming too much of a followers
[1:38:20] instead of a time that we should the
[1:38:22] lord is expecting to especially to see
[1:38:24] fruits in our life
[1:38:26] we are still crying as babies and all
[1:38:28] that we want to do is follow and follow
[1:38:29] and be carried
[1:38:31] on the shoulders of the lord but it's a
[1:38:33] time
[1:38:34] that the following
[1:38:36] kids can follow amen but the body of
[1:38:38] christ has come to a point where we can
[1:38:40] lead by the holy spirit
[1:38:42] glory hallelujah amen there was a time
[1:38:45] peter couldn't cast him on a certain
[1:38:47] lady brought

[1:38:53] and peter and the apostles couldn't do
[1:38:54] they couldn't help it they chanted they

[1:38:59] that this thing should be done by heart
[1:39:00] by prayer and fasten
[1:39:02] when you fast
[1:39:03] and the body comes under the holy spirit
[1:39:05] the lord can do much better

[1:39:20] fall upon the people in the world they
[1:39:21] will rise amen we have to go to a point
[1:39:24] people want to just touch you just like
[1:39:26] i'm touching my brother i know the
[1:39:28] anointing of the lord is on him touching
[1:39:30] him i'll be blessed amen there should be
[1:39:33] a time in your life and it is now amen
[1:39:36] that people can see christ in you

[1:39:40] that jesus christ is in your heart amen
[1:39:44] people can see and just that attraction
[1:39:46] of the holy ghost in you and they could
[1:39:49] see that sister naomi has got christ in
[1:39:50] here amen they could see sister rebecca

[1:48:31] you have cried but you don't really seek
[1:48:33] god in your life
[1:48:34] you want the lord to speak to you but
[1:48:36] you don't feel the lord in your life
[1:48:38] believe from your heart
[1:48:40] that lord i didn't promise myself

[1:48:45] you come into this kingdom you ordain me
[1:48:47] here i was in you i was you you were me
[1:48:50] and so this promise is what you made for
[1:48:52] me and so in your name i received my
[1:48:55] blessing
[1:48:56] in your name i received the holy ghost
[1:48:58] baptism in your name i receive the power
[1:49:00] to overcome every trials and temptation
[1:49:03] and i stand as a daughter of god i stand
[1:49:05] as a son of god and i'm matching victory
[1:49:08] to overcome every demon amen
[1:49:11] is a time to lead
[1:49:13] the time to follow is behind us amen is
[1:49:16] the time to take the leadership mantle
[1:49:18] like elisha did and match on and open
[1:49:21] the red sea and open a river jordan and
[1:49:23] speak and create things in life amen
[1:49:27] it's not the time to cry no more the
[1:49:29] crying time is over it was good to cry
[1:49:31] yes
[1:49:32] cry bring some relief it's good but
[1:49:34] don't cry don't be a crime baby all the
[1:49:36] time
[1:49:39] don't be a crime baby that we want god
[1:49:40] to wipe your tears all the time you know
[1:49:42] the lord is tired of wiping out our
[1:49:44] tears
[1:49:45] the lord wants us to be men and women
[1:49:47] amen the lord wants us to stand as a son
[1:49:49] of god to be like joshua
[1:49:52] say who are you
[1:49:54] and the lord has to declare his identity
[1:49:56] he said i'm you joshua i'm the captain
[1:49:58] of the host i'm you i'm the one leading
[1:50:00] the army amen because joshua knew he
[1:50:02] knew his commission
[1:50:04] joshua didn't cry
[1:50:06] compare i compared the ministry of
[1:50:08] joshua and moses moses did a lot of
[1:50:10] crying
[1:50:12] and joshua learned from me that no
[1:50:14] moses was too much like a crying baby he
[1:50:16] used to cry too much i think i don't
[1:50:18] have to pay this attribute
[1:50:20] i'll put it behind me
[1:50:22] i'm not going to be a crime baby no more
[1:50:23] i'm not going to be like moses so when
[1:50:25] joshua was on the line no joshua didn't
[1:50:27] do crying
[1:50:28] because he has learned he has followed
[1:50:30] moses and now he has able to overcome
[1:50:33] some of the problems of moses
[1:50:35] amen moses was moses was
[1:50:37] taken from
[1:50:38] from water right
[1:50:39] so crime was part of his ministry
[1:50:43] but
[1:50:44] joshua
[1:50:45] wasn't taken from a river
[1:50:48] so joshua was born on a land
[1:50:51] his commission is what to divide the
[1:50:52] land for their people
[1:50:54] and if you've got 12 tribes
[1:50:56] with men and women and you're going to
[1:50:58] divide lands for
[1:51:00] husbands and wife and children and you
[1:51:02] the leader you are crying baby
[1:51:04] when are you going to divide the land
[1:51:05] for the people
[1:51:06] you won't be able to do that job
[1:51:08] so most uh joshua learned from moses
[1:51:11] that i'm not going to be a crime baby
[1:51:13] i'm going to be a man as the lord has
[1:51:15] ordained me i pick my mantle my
[1:51:17] commission and i stand as a son of god
[1:51:19] and defeat every amalekite every
[1:51:22] jebusite every canaanite and divide the
[1:51:24] land for the people of the living god
[1:51:26] amen
[1:51:27] so as a daughter of god amen you are
[1:51:30] prophetess
[1:51:31] the same christ that was in elijah is in
[1:51:34] you
[1:51:35] the same christ in william abraham is in
[1:51:37] you the same christ in jesus is in you
[1:51:40] and when you speak heaven follows you
[1:51:42] when you speak heaven says amen when you
[1:51:45] said let it be heaven says it is already
[1:51:48] done amen so your lord is not to cry all
[1:51:51] the time
[1:51:52] wipe your tears
[1:51:54] and speak
[1:51:55] and move forward amen
[1:52:00] [Applause]
[1:52:07] as you go through jesus you're going to
[1:52:08] have battles
[1:52:10] like joshua because you want to possess
[1:52:12] the land
[1:52:13] a malachite
[1:52:14] jebusite canaanites and all the heights
[1:52:18] and kites are on the land already
[1:52:20] and they are not going to hand over the
[1:52:22] land to that
[1:52:23] this your promised land take it no it
[1:52:25] doesn't come that way you're going to do
[1:52:27] what fight
[1:52:29] you're going to what battle
[1:52:32] you're going to take sword and kill
[1:52:35] kill every enemy
[1:52:37] and you know the greater the enemy
[1:52:39] is you
[1:52:40] when you kill this enemy first
[1:52:42] all the other enemies are already taken
[1:52:44] care of
[1:52:46] glory hallelujah
[1:52:48] one time uh elisha i think on his seven
[1:52:51] gehazi
[1:52:52] yes he had an enemy the enemy was
[1:52:54] himself
[1:52:55] too emotional he jumped up all the time
[1:52:58] one time he saw a armies of a i think
[1:53:00] philistines
[1:53:02] around the master's house
[1:53:04] he quickly went to wick the master
[1:53:06] elisha master wake up we are done
[1:53:09] look at the armies of
[1:53:10] philistine all around us
[1:53:12] we are surrounded
[1:53:14] what did elijah do he didn't panic
[1:53:18] is the lord opened his eyes
[1:53:20] and when the lord opened his eyes what
[1:53:22] did he see
[1:53:23] chariot of fire
[1:53:25] of fire angels of the lord host of
[1:53:28] heaven few funnies celestial bodies all
[1:53:31] around them
[1:53:32] and then elijah sorry gehazi stop
[1:53:35] running around
[1:53:37] his spirit was calm down you need to

[1:54:11] his idols
[1:54:13] he was invoking his deity
[1:54:15] and david was wise enough not to invoke
[1:54:17] david
[1:54:18] he didn't even invoke his experience
[1:54:20] he had to invoke his experience before
[1:54:22] saul to let so know that he's called
[1:54:24] what a lion and a bear
[1:54:27] as a testimony but when he became before
[1:54:29] the situation he invoked the name of the
[1:54:31] lord jesus christ jehovah and said the
[1:54:34] lord of israel whom you defile he's the
[1:54:36] one who is going to kill you for me

[1:57:20] when you create in your heart what you
[1:57:22] create
[1:57:23] you might not see it physically but it's
[1:57:25] working in their hearts
[1:57:26] and in the
[1:57:28] the laws on time as brother jackson
[1:57:29] between here and there
[1:57:32] something will happen amen between here

[1:58:03] and so they can't keep good
[1:58:04] relationships
[1:58:06] they are not even happy with their own
[1:58:08] self
[1:58:09] it's the devil that puts that spread
[1:58:11] upon human beings
[1:58:12] by we're son of god you're a daughter of
[1:58:14] god
[1:58:14] temper is not my promise no

[1:58:47] overflowing and elisha has to pass
[1:58:49] through your problem might not be a
[1:58:51] river jordan overflowing by your jordan
[1:58:54] might be a situation in your life
[1:58:56] that it needs to be what taken away take
[1:58:58] be done away with
[1:59:00] it could be a character that is not a
[1:59:02] cut of jesus christ
[1:59:04] it could be a nature that runs through
[1:59:06] your ancestry
[1:59:07] it could be drunkenness that you
[1:59:09] inherited from your ancestry
[1:59:11] your grandfather was drinking your dad
[1:59:13] was drinking your ankles are drinking
[1:59:15] and that's what is on you

[1:59:35] amen
[1:59:36] he didn't call it by your family name he
[1:59:38] called you by the name of jesus christ
[1:59:40] and the name of jesus christ has got the
[1:59:42] power to overcome every situation
[1:59:45] glory hallelujah
[1:59:47] let's read this quote for me
[1:59:52] six four
[1:59:53] zero two zero nine count down
[1:59:58] countdown 64-0209
[2:00:03] the paragraph i'm not really sure he
[2:00:05] said now
[2:00:07] look at here
[2:00:10] on the day of pentecost the holy spirit
[2:00:12] the holy ghost separated itself
[2:00:14] and tongues of fire set upon each one
[2:00:17] tons of fires upon what
[2:00:19] each one
[2:00:21] not only on but smiley
[2:00:24] not only on sister dixon but each one of
[2:00:27] us
[2:00:28] not only on on the adults
[2:00:30] but each one
[2:00:32] their children amen not only on that and
[2:00:34] mom but what each one
[2:00:37] not only on the musician but what each
[2:00:39] one has to get a portion of the pill of
[2:00:42] fire
[2:00:43] glory hallelujah amen
[2:00:45] is that a a portion of the holy ghost
[2:00:47] suddenly upon
[2:00:49] each okay the gripple of fire separated
[2:00:52] so it's one pill of fire separated and
[2:00:54] each one received a portion of that holy
[2:00:57] spirit
[2:00:58] so now the prophet is telling the pillar
[2:00:59] of fire is what the holy spirit
[2:01:02] so if you have the holy spirit what do
[2:01:03] you have in your heart
[2:01:05] the pill of fire
[2:01:08] this is someone on his own if you have
[2:01:09] the pillow fire
[2:01:10] which burns demons
[2:01:12] what should you be afraid of
[2:01:15] why do you panic in life
[2:01:17] why do you fret your heart
[2:01:20] because of an adverse situation
[2:01:23] well if you put one if you put one tank
[2:01:25] on off if you put one tank of fire
[2:01:29] and two tanks of fire together you got
[2:01:31] what twice the strength that you had in
[2:01:34] one
[2:01:36] if i put my little lake of fire
[2:01:38] and brother solomon's lake of fire we
[2:01:40] got a double portion
[2:01:43] if we agree and touch on a situation
[2:01:46] his tongue of fire and my tangle fire
[2:01:49] can accomplish situations in our life
[2:01:52] because it's coming from what one tongue
[2:01:53] of fire
[2:01:54] the lord jesus christ
[2:01:57] so we need to what put our strength
[2:01:58] together there's strength in unity
[2:02:01] amen
[2:02:02] burying each other's burden
[2:02:04] helping each other spiritually
[2:02:06] physically whatever you can
[2:02:07] prayers and fasting take the problem on
[2:02:09] yourself
[2:02:10] don't think it's not my problem it's not
[2:02:12] my son it's not my daughter
[2:02:14] but take it it's your daughter who is
[2:02:15] sick
[2:02:16] take it to your son who's gone wayward
[2:02:19] and write in your book
[2:02:21] and say lord this is my son too it's my
[2:02:23] daughter too i'm going to stand him for
[2:02:25] for my son's daughter i'm going to
[2:02:27] standing for my brother's daughter or
[2:02:29] sister or wife or husband and i'm going
[2:02:31] to pray till i see the situation fixed
[2:02:34] i'm going to call the positive into
[2:02:36] creation
[2:02:37] we are tired of the negatives we want to
[2:02:38] see the positive
[2:02:39] and when you take the tongue of fire and
[2:02:41] a tongue of fire agree
[2:02:43] and to put situation together and pray
[2:02:46] watch what happens
[2:02:47] amen
[2:02:49] glory hallelujah
[2:02:50] yes i remember it was elijah used elijah
[2:02:53] for example innovation took two sticks
[2:02:55] and put them together

[2:03:02] you get two when you put two and two
[2:03:03] together get what four
[2:03:05] multiply the strength and becomes a
[2:03:06] rippling effect
