[5:25] hand clap of praise this morning praise
[5:29] the law
[5:32] [Applause]
[5:34] praise the Lord Amen there there was a
[5:38] little quote that we read actually
[5:41] brother Quentin read in the Sunday
[5:42] school this morning it sort of goes with
[5:44] the purse only on Starkman so instead of
[5:48] reading a psalm I wanted to read this
[5:49] quote to you says no man knows the
[5:53] things of God say the Spirit of God and
[5:55] he to whom the Spirit of God reveals
[5:58] them we need to call on God for
[6:00] revelation more than anything else in
[6:02] the world we have accepted a Bible we
[6:05] have accepted a great thing the truth of
[6:07] it but it is still not real to most
[6:10] people because the revelation by the
[6:12] Spirit is not there the word has not
[6:15] been quickened the Bible says in 2nd
[6:17] Corinthians 5:21 that we have become the
[6:20] righteousness of God by our union with
[6:23] Jesus Christ did you get it it says that
[6:26] we are the very righteousness of God
[6:29] himself by being in Christ it says that
[6:33] he Jesus became sin for us it does not
[6:36] say he became sinful but became sin for
[6:39] us that by our union with him we might
[6:43] become the righteousness of God if we
[6:46] accept the fact and we must that he
[6:49] literally became sin for us by his
[6:51] substitution for us then we must also
[6:54] accept the fact that we by arguing with
[6:56] him have become the very righteousness
[6:59] of God to reject one is to reject the
[7:02] other to accept one is to accept the
[7:04] other now we know the Bible says that it
[7:07] can't be denied but the revelation of it
[7:10] is missing it is not real to the
[7:12] majority of God's children it is just a
[7:15] good verse in the Bible but we need to
[7:17] have it made alive to us that will take
[7:20] the revenue
[7:21] amen we need revelation more than
[7:25] anything and we must understand that we
[7:27] are the very righteousness of God by our
[7:30] union with Jesus Christ I'm so grateful
[7:32] for that
[7:33] praise our Lord amen let's end this
[7:36] little song together I know who I am

[1:15:40] statement made I was reading recently
[1:15:43] some people was complaining about the
[1:15:46] brother brand was preaching I he should
[1:15:47] just lay off the sisters and all this
[1:15:49] and and he'd come right back the next
[1:15:51] service and told him everything they
[1:15:52] said in the conversation and they still
[1:15:55] didn't repent right but he told him at
[1:15:57] the end of service he said sisters or is
[1:16:01] it you know he just kind of said it
[1:16:02] anything sisters just a congregation so

[1:16:21] are ready to give more you have gone as
[1:16:25] far as you can go
[1:16:26] I say what a statement right so if you
[1:16:32] looking for more from God maybe God
[1:16:33] looking for more from you right but

[1:17:16] I heard that song that sister Sean was
[1:17:19] saying just a few weeks ago and and you
[1:17:24] know she brought that forth I said man
[1:17:25] that was alright when I heard it it was
[1:17:27] a gap planning guitar and he was singing
[1:17:30] up and so she was saying I'm thinking
[1:17:31] myself man I wish brother Jeffery could

[1:17:50] everything that's happened here enough
[1:17:52] in the name of the Lord a man a man and
[1:18:00] if you all just noticed some of the
[1:18:02] words and brother Jeffery songs I see a
[1:18:04] generation rise enough to take their
[1:18:07] place with selfless faith with selfless
[1:18:10] faith this is I see a near revival
[1:18:13] stirring as we pray and seek we're on
[1:18:19] our knees were on our knees so that goes
[1:18:23] right along with let the let the light
[1:18:25] in the fire again and that's what we
[1:18:28] preached on today light the fire again a
[1:18:32] man a man praise the Lord
[1:18:36] Hebrews chapter 12 verse 29 says for our
[1:18:43] God is a consuming fire a man our God is
[1:18:49] a consuming fire and I I do have another
[1:18:53] verse and judges too but I tell you what
[1:18:57] I had y'all standing for so long I'm
[1:18:59] gonna just say a word of Prayer and then
[1:19:00] y'all can get that it you know hold to
[1:19:03] it a little school bring it out amen
[1:19:05] here in our sermon
[1:19:06] let's pray amen before you have your
[1:19:08] seats father we are grateful for
[1:19:11] everything that has happened here this
[1:19:13] morning we have felt the anointing of
[1:19:16] God in this place and God we know that
[1:19:20] there is more that you want to do so
[1:19:22] we're praying that the Spirit of the
[1:19:23] Lord would have the preeminence a man
[1:19:27] and this portion of the service as we
[1:19:29] endeavor to just bring a thought a man
[1:19:33] as you have given it to us and help me
[1:19:35] God to get myself out of the way help
[1:19:37] the people also to get themselves out of
[1:19:39] the way may they pull on the Word of God
[1:19:41] and me you speak Lord the things that
[1:19:45] need to be spoken here today I may have
[1:19:46] no
[1:19:47] but God you're in control so take take
[1:19:50] all of us that move us to decide that
[1:19:53] you might get all the glory and all the
[1:19:54] honor a man out of this portion of the
[1:19:57] services in Jesus name we pray amen amen
[1:20:00] god bless you can be seated so so our
[1:20:14] thought here is is like the fire again
[1:20:17] and I feel that I'll just need to kind
[1:20:23] of lay a foundation for a few things a
[1:20:26] man but let me let me read the scripture
[1:20:31] out of out of judges to a man if you
[1:20:34] would just follow me there I want to
[1:20:37] start hit verse 70 and it says and the
[1:20:40] people serve the Lord all the days of
[1:20:44] Joshua and all the days of the elders
[1:20:46] that outlive Joshua who have seen all
[1:20:48] the great works of the Lord that he did
[1:20:50] for Israel and Joshua the son of nun the
[1:20:53] servant of the Lord died being a hundred
[1:20:56] and ten years old and they buried him in
[1:20:58] the border of his inheritance and
[1:21:00] Timnath Harris and the mouth of ephraim
[1:21:04] on the north side of the hill - and also
[1:21:08] all that generation were gathered unto
[1:21:10] their fathers and there rose another
[1:21:12] generation after them which knew not the
[1:21:16] Lord nor yet the works which he had done
[1:21:19] for Israel a man and the children of
[1:21:21] Israel did evil in the sight of Lord and
[1:21:23] serve Balaam and they forsook the Lord
[1:21:25] God of their fathers which brought them
[1:21:28] out of land of Egypt and followed other
[1:21:30] gods the gods of the people that were
[1:21:33] round about them and bowed themselves
[1:21:35] unto them and provoked the Lord to anger
[1:21:38] and they forsook the Lord and served
[1:21:40] bail and Ashtaroth and the anger of the
[1:21:43] Lord was hot against Israel and he
[1:21:46] delivered them into the hands of
[1:21:47] spoilers and spoiled them and he sold
[1:21:50] them into the hands of their enemies
[1:21:51] round about so they could not any longer
[1:21:53] stand before their enemies with a soever
[1:21:56] they went out
[1:21:57] and the Lord was against them for evil
[1:21:59] as the Lord has said and as the Lord has
[1:22:01] sworn unto them and they were greatly
[1:22:03] distressed it meant so I wanted that's a
[1:22:06] background scripture that we want to try
[1:22:09] to work our way back into a man but if
[1:22:12] you just bear with me here today I want
[1:22:14] to kind of lay a couple things in we're
[1:22:18] doing something that for spirit and
[1:22:22] truth has never been done before
[1:22:25] amen we're doing something that really a
[1:22:30] lot of other churches don't do anymore a
[1:22:34] man and with this tent that we're taking
[1:22:38] - you know with light the fire again -
[1:22:40] something that the Lord put in our heart
[1:22:42] and I know that being message believers
[1:22:45] a man you know we don't see that too
[1:22:47] much anymore and there's probably a
[1:22:50] number of reasons why we don't see it a
[1:22:53] man one one particular reason is that is
[1:22:57] is I got to be careful when I say this
[1:23:00] but one particular reason that is not
[1:23:02] effective my god
[1:23:05] right that's one particular reason is
[1:23:08] that the Lord is certainly you know
[1:23:11] there was a generation that came before
[1:23:13] us a man where that was very effective
[1:23:15] and now Dawn has moved on to something
[1:23:19] else where so what they did before or
[1:23:21] what they did before is not it's not
[1:23:22] effective today so what I want to just
[1:23:25] kind of start off by saying is that
[1:23:27] we're not trying to revive the world
[1:23:32] right we're not trying to set up a tent
[1:23:35] that could pull 14,000 people in a man
[1:23:38] and and and we're not trying to be like
[1:23:40] Billy Graham right we're not trying to
[1:23:43] be like all Roberts you know and I think
[1:23:46] that's where we kind of got a little
[1:23:47] confusion in because even though we're
[1:23:50] not trying to be like them we are trying
[1:23:53] to get that last seat so if one comes
[1:23:59] for from this then our work was worth
[1:24:02] it's alright a man so yeah we're not
[1:24:06] trying to be like them but we are trying
[1:24:08] right to get that last seat praise the
[1:24:12] Lord and that's where the church has
[1:24:13] missed it right we're very comfortable
[1:24:17] being within our four walls but every
[1:24:20] once in a while we need to get on the
[1:24:21] outside and do something meet somebody
[1:24:23] where they're at they haven't come to
[1:24:26] you you go to him
[1:24:28] amen and and we know that brother
[1:24:30] Branham told us a story of the mother
[1:24:32] Eagle right the mother Eagle had to go
[1:24:35] looking for her baby she never waited
[1:24:39] for the baby to come to her but she went
[1:24:41] flying over the area setting up a tent
[1:24:46] huh amen she went flying over the area
[1:24:49] trying to find that seat she be there
[1:24:54] was one there but she didn't know where
[1:24:56] it was so she went out amen and she
[1:25:00] began this let out a scream and when I
[1:25:02] scream without that baby can identify
[1:25:05] the baby was found in a chicken coop oh
[1:25:10] alright some some may not be with me so
[1:25:13] let me slow down just to hit me but what
[1:25:17] happened was that you know the store was
[1:25:19] told that this mother Eagle lost more
[1:25:21] than eggs and I couldn't kid mama
[1:25:24] couldn't understand where the egg was
[1:25:26] you know and uh but she knows she gave
[1:25:29] birth she knew that you know I got three
[1:25:33] eggs I only have two here somebody got
[1:25:36] one of my eggs right and somehow the egg
[1:25:39] ended up out of her nest and ended up in
[1:25:41] a chicken coop now you need to
[1:25:43] understand something that amen
[1:25:45] if the atmosphere is right it'll bring
[1:25:50] forth a birth and because that bait that
[1:25:53] that baby eagle was in the atmosphere
[1:25:55] underneath a mother hen
[1:25:59] but even though that atmosphere birth
[1:26:02] took place the ego was never a chicken
[1:26:07] the eat of the eagle you know could not
[1:26:10] understand why it was different but you
[1:26:13] can understand why it acted different
[1:26:16] why it look different it just have no
[1:26:21] identification but that is they better
[1:26:26] they stay faithful in the chicken house
[1:26:31] stay right there
[1:26:33] and once they run I still got my baby
[1:26:38] out here and my baby Pelican has already
[1:26:41] come to cook but I gotta go find my baby
[1:26:43] and the mother Eagle f7 always just
[1:26:47] beginning a lot of screaming and while
[1:26:49] she's screaming the loot baby Eagles
[1:26:51] down there in a chicken coop and looks
[1:26:53] at them say I'm not gonna buy with that
[1:26:56] say I don't know I never heard this term
[1:26:59] before never uh preaching like this
[1:27:01] before but I'm identified with that type
[1:27:04] of screen and then the lovely eagle just
[1:27:07] began to circle and just begin to scream
[1:27:09] and weren't they Halloween
[1:27:12] you wanna go by the water spot maybe
[1:27:15] that will either have some questions for
[1:27:17] the chickens Roy came out so like that
[1:27:19] and the chickens say you were made then
[1:27:22] enough but I look different than y'all
[1:27:24] why can't I be out there like that don't
[1:27:27] even move a certain way somewhere honey
[1:27:31] somebody and wherever there we went
[1:27:34] finally when they could get the answers
[1:27:36] that they needed from the chickens can't
[1:27:40] give the answers they needed from the
[1:27:42] chickens mama comes free with again and
[1:27:46] then where mom alone that scream struck
[1:27:55] on the inside of that baby but I was
[1:27:57] down down the chicken coop you say and
[1:28:10] then squeeeeeeze begin to go back and
[1:28:12] forth they begin to communicate and Mama
[1:28:16] begin to tell that eagle I'm not coming
[1:28:19] down to the chicken coop but i'ma let
[1:28:22] you know you can't come out you can't
[1:28:26] come out
[1:28:28] [Applause]
[1:28:29] I'm only inside of you that you can come
[1:28:33] out of the chicken coop when you get
[1:28:35] ready just two weeks and before you knew
[1:28:48] that Eagle was at the chicken coop never
[1:28:51] to see the chickens again profit all
[1:28:57] that stay and everything like what in
[1:28:59] the world is that but he was talking
[1:29:01] about you
[1:29:02] because you was that Eagle locked down
[1:29:04] and denominational systems use that even
[1:29:07] locked into the fence in a little but
[1:29:09] when you finally heard the word of God
[1:29:12] something struck on the inside of him
[1:29:14] and he couldn't help but respond
[1:29:21] hallelujah that one part of my notes I'm
[1:29:30] just trying to set a foundation so we
[1:29:32] understand what is going on why don't
[1:29:35] water Holy Spirit would just lead us to
[1:29:37] do something like this like I said we're
[1:29:39] not trying to go out and win the nation
[1:29:42] but we are looking for that last seat
[1:29:45] and and we'll do this to try to get
[1:29:48] their attention
[1:29:49] whatever we can and so anybody that want
[1:29:51] to criticize it well praise the pray for
[1:29:53] us amen amen just just pray for us that

[1:30:23] pot ain't man so let's not pull each
[1:30:26] other down let's lift each other up
[1:30:29] alright I want to read a little thought
[1:30:32] here brother Troy sent this quote to me
[1:30:35] and I want to just kind of set this up
[1:30:36] before we go further a man out of pom or
[1:30:39] locust canker worm caterpillar a man
[1:30:42] says says now we're coming into a
[1:30:46] serious thought of subjects here I
[1:30:49] believe that there will come a time of
[1:30:52] the restoring the whole things that has
[1:30:55] been done wrong now I believe that too
[1:30:58] and now I'm believing it's going beyond
[1:31:00] we know brother branham's managed to
[1:31:02] fulfill that we know that but it's going
[1:31:04] even beyond that right we talk about all
[1:31:06] things families have fallen apart the
[1:31:09] restoration of all things right lives a
[1:31:12] man handed by sicknesses the restoration
[1:31:16] of all things we believe that right so
[1:31:19] it says I I believe that there will come
[1:31:21] a time restoring of all things that has
[1:31:23] been done wrong and we are trying this
[1:31:27] is the statement here we are trying with
[1:31:30] all that is within us and other men are
[1:31:33] trying such great evangelists as Billy
[1:31:36] Graham and old Roberts and many other of
[1:31:38] the outstanding evangelist ministers
[1:31:41] pastors who a lawyer to their posts are
[1:31:43] trying to see revival in our time now if
[1:31:48] they were trying in their turn on the
[1:31:51] sea revival
[1:31:52] what about holiday right what should we
[1:31:56] be doing we should also be trying but if
[1:32:00] they were trying we also ought to be
[1:32:01] trying in how're they listen a man sir
[1:32:05] he says a receiver volatile and you the
[1:32:08] truth of God are praying for a revival
[1:32:11] in our time and then we can't keep
[1:32:13] talking about what God D
[1:32:15] six to seven hundred years ago we need
[1:32:19] to talk about what he's doing right now
[1:32:22] if somebody gotta get started if you
[1:32:25] suck them right so we're praying amen oh
[1:32:31] you shouldn't god I pray for revival
[1:32:33] tens of thousands of prayers meet God
[1:32:35] every hour for revival in our time and
[1:32:38] it is written in the scriptures if the
[1:32:40] people that are called by my name shall
[1:32:41] assemble themselves together and will
[1:32:43] pray then I'll hear from heaven now that
[1:32:47] didn't stop him brother branham's day
[1:32:48] that that promise is still for us today
[1:32:50] if we would have said we will hop allow
[1:32:52] ourselves employees seek the face of God
[1:32:55] God said he will hear from heaven I am
[1:32:57] don't let nobody take that promise
[1:32:59] surely a man this is my generation this
[1:33:03] is the time I live and I think I mean
[1:33:06] hearing what God did in the generation
[1:33:08] past I get faith and then my think it's
[1:33:11] an order to believe that that that Jesus
[1:33:13] Christ is the same yesterday today
[1:33:16] forever and he'll do the same for me
[1:33:19] what good is of me to share testimonies
[1:33:22] of God healing people 50 60 years ago
[1:33:24] when we got sick people right now
[1:33:27] the reason I share the testimony system
[1:33:30] nature things to believe that God can do
[1:33:33] the same thing for you hallelujah rights
[1:33:38] and receive another cop I'm a man show
[1:33:39] assuming themselves together will prove
[1:33:41] them out here from heaven
[1:33:42] now if the children got out simple
[1:33:44] assembling themselves together and
[1:33:46] praying for revival in our time and
[1:33:48] revival is not coming so wait a minute
[1:33:51] if we assemble together and we pray for
[1:33:54] revival in that time we should expect to
[1:33:55] see God move
[1:33:56] and if God don't move he said then there
[1:34:00] must be something wrong somewhere and
[1:34:02] that's why we had to go through when a
[1:34:04] couple Friday nights what we went
[1:34:06] through because we want to know that we
[1:34:08] want to make sure there's nothing
[1:34:09] blocking God from hindering amen from
[1:34:12] blocking God from actually doing what he
[1:34:14] promised that he would do Amen we want
[1:34:16] to get everything clean all right I was
[1:34:20] thinking here say our God is a consuming
[1:34:21] fire and I my thought is what he did in
[1:34:25] one generation he will do in the next
[1:34:27] a man but his his consuming fires to
[1:34:31] fire to burn up all of our unbelief a
[1:34:33] man and also his Holy Ghost consuming
[1:34:36] fires to burn the sin out of our lives
[1:34:39] Amen hallelujah we required the live
[1:34:42] holy - not just a mama and all of my
[1:34:46] call to live holy daddy and all in one
[1:34:49] call to live holy granddaddy ain't only
[1:34:51] one call it holy all of us are called a
[1:34:53] live holy and only way you're gonna live
[1:34:56] whole is when you got the Holy Ghost Oh
[1:35:01] blessed be the name of the Lord's so you
[1:35:04] know what this is our day hey man this
[1:35:07] is our time this is our generation and
[1:35:10] and I don't have time to read it all but
[1:35:12] I know that every generation gets their
[1:35:14] chance at the revival and you know this
[1:35:17] is our generation so we're doing all we
[1:35:18] can to try to bring revival to our
[1:35:21] generation right in brother branham's
[1:35:23] day Billy Billy Billy Graham and or
[1:35:25] Roberts all of them they did everything
[1:35:27] they could to bring revival in their day
[1:35:29] so this is our time right and we're
[1:35:31] trying to bring bring bring revival that
[1:35:34] the whole thing is about atmosphere
[1:35:36] right and we have a responsibility to
[1:35:39] create the right atmosphere a man and
[1:35:43] here I want to just bring a quote here
[1:35:46] out of divine love you know if we want
[1:35:50] to see God do something that we have to
[1:35:52] put people in the right atmosphere for
[1:35:53] God to do it
[1:35:54] a man listen and divine love II says now
[1:35:57] you've got to create an atmosphere and
[1:36:01] your faith will do it they were all in
[1:36:05] the upper room with one Accord now you
[1:36:08] know when God moved in the upper room to
[1:36:10] notice there was all in one Accord if we
[1:36:12] try to do this in one pulling this way
[1:36:14] and one pulling that way and everybody
[1:36:16] not pulling together we gonna have some
[1:36:17] trouble but if we can bring the church
[1:36:19] into one Accord then God gonna like the
[1:36:22] fire again listen he says now you got to
[1:36:25] create an atmosphere your faithful do it
[1:36:26] they were they were all in the upper
[1:36:28] rooms when a court when suddenly there
[1:36:29] came from heaven as a sound of a rushing
[1:36:32] mighty wind
[1:36:32] the atmosphere was right it takes an
[1:36:36] atmosphere to do anything
[1:36:39] it takes an atmosphere to do anything
[1:36:43] just just breaking that quote down this
[1:36:46] for a second you know there was another
[1:36:47] quote I was looking at I didn't bring it
[1:36:49] here but he said you know if you were
[1:36:52] trying to set up the atmosphere for a
[1:36:53] dance and you put a band on the stage
[1:36:56] and say now now set an atmosphere we
[1:36:59] want to have a dance and after that if
[1:37:01] the band went up there and start playing
[1:37:04] blessed assurance Jesus is mine that
[1:37:10] right you will look at the band the
[1:37:13] record said look you ain't creating the
[1:37:15] right type of atmosphere we said dance
[1:37:18] not not church service right Amen
[1:37:22] because see there's 30 atmospheres that
[1:37:24] go with certain things you know you
[1:37:27] can't even do certain things until you
[1:37:29] put yourself in the atmosphere of doing
[1:37:32] it huh you know you listen that you want
[1:37:37] people walking down the street with
[1:37:38] their headphones in they had and and
[1:37:40] they just dancing looking I mean they
[1:37:42] look crazy right but but because that
[1:37:46] person got something in their ears they
[1:37:48] are in a particular atmosphere that's
[1:37:51] Romanian and they are responding to the
[1:37:55] atmosphere the news that creates the
[1:37:59] atmosphere are you somebody a man so
[1:38:03] when we come to church which one have
[1:38:05] the right singer sing songs they help
[1:38:07] create an atmosphere the world comes in
[1:38:11] to create an atmosphere and when the
[1:38:14] atmosphere is created the devil is
[1:38:18] God amen the devil is cast because our
[1:38:26] atmosphere healings take place
[1:38:29] deliverance
[1:38:30] take place whatever you can have when is
[1:38:34] the right atmosphere now you have some
[1:38:41] people that like to help create the
[1:38:43] atmosphere and then you have others that
[1:38:45] just like to drain it so you got it you
[1:38:53] got it which one you gonna be yeah DJ
[1:38:56] sets the atmosphere
[1:38:58] all right the DJ he sets the atmosphere
[1:39:01] he got certain music and he got he got
[1:39:04] what you call a playlist and some of
[1:39:08] y'all pairs need to see what y'all kids
[1:39:10] got in a playlist you want to know why
[1:39:12] they acted the way they act him it's
[1:39:14] because of the atmosphere glory to God
[1:39:20] if they get rid of that and you know oh
[1:39:21] my god you know if they listen to the
[1:39:24] words you'll see a different child if
[1:39:26] they listen to a praise and worship
[1:39:28] right certain certain music you'll see a
[1:39:31] different child amen
[1:39:33] you know atmosphere has you know I'm
[1:39:36] gonna finish this in second but you know
[1:39:38] there was a statement made there was
[1:39:40] these boys I think my four five for
[1:39:42] sharing a room together and and in the
[1:39:45] room you know they they all grew up in
[1:39:48] this room and and and and as one you

[1:39:59] way down to the fifth boy every board in
[1:40:01] that family say he was going to the Navy
[1:40:02] and they tried trying to figure out why
[1:40:05] did all these boys grow up and want to
[1:40:07] go to the Navy like this what happened
[1:40:08] here
[1:40:09] they went to the vibra house walked into
[1:40:11] the room where the boys were sleeping
[1:40:13] and they noticed one picture on the wall
[1:40:15] and this one picture was a ship in the
[1:40:19] ocean and that was looked at that every
[1:40:22] night they went to bed they woke up in
[1:40:24] the morning they saw the same picture
[1:40:26] and that
[1:40:27] picture creative desire but those boss
[1:40:32] the wallet going beyond the seat so the
[1:40:35] only way they can get there is by
[1:40:36] joining the lazy one picture created a
[1:40:39] desire if a picture of a boat can do
[1:40:44] that to some Lawrence well put the

[1:43:01] mighty wind the atmosphere was right it
[1:43:02] takes atmosphere to do anything oh there
[1:43:05] was one of the little thing I wanted to
[1:43:07] add Darris listen to the man talking
[1:43:09] yesterday
[1:43:09] and he was telling me how he was he grew
[1:43:12] up in Zambia Zambia and you can take
[1:43:16] that down he he grew up in Zambia and
[1:43:19] while growing up in Zambia he would read
[1:43:23] magazines that came from America he
[1:43:27] would see books and things like that
[1:43:28] that came from America just flooded you
[1:43:30] know the area and and because of him
[1:43:33] reading the books from America it put a
[1:43:36] desire in him that he wanted to become
[1:43:38] an American citizen and that man would
[1:43:42] not let go of that dream and that all
[1:43:45] was birthed from what he was reading
[1:43:47] right what he was what he was you know
[1:43:50] the environment that he put himself in
[1:43:51] and I'm saying it because parents if we
[1:43:53] put our children in the right
[1:43:54] environment you'll see certain things
[1:43:56] get birth in them and let me tell you
[1:44:01] something just coming to church and
[1:44:02] gonna be good enough you got to do some
[1:44:05] things at home right that that's right
[1:44:08] when we were coming up it was a blessing
[1:44:10] and our parents sent us off to meetings
[1:44:11] and ones that they couldn't go to they
[1:44:14] was cinders but ones that they could go
[1:44:15] to they took us let me say that again
[1:44:18] was that they couldn't go to they census
[1:44:21] was that they could go to they took us
[1:44:24] my daddy won't even serve in the law but
[1:44:26] he still took us to meetings and by
[1:44:30] putting us in atmospheres like that
[1:44:32] that's where I received the baptism the
[1:44:34] Holy Ghost right he put me in an
[1:44:37] atmosphere to get something my daddy
[1:44:39] took me to it
[1:44:40] glory to God it changed the board that
[1:44:43] was in his house you want to see your
[1:44:45] children change you can have to do
[1:44:46] something different
[1:44:47] you got the maker sacrifice you know if
[1:44:50] they don't if it's not important to you
[1:44:51] your kids don't see that they will
[1:44:55] recognize what's important to you your
[1:44:58] actions demonstrate what's important to
[1:45:01] you what you spend your money on
[1:45:04] demonstrates what's important to you you
[1:45:09] want to know what's important look at a
[1:45:11] checkbook you already know what's
[1:45:16] important hallelujah all right let me go
[1:45:21] home please Holy Ghost amen listen God's
[1:45:26] but this man you know he was looking at
[1:45:28] these books and everything and you know
[1:45:30] he went through great extremes to
[1:45:32] actually get here to the u.s. he packed
[1:45:34] his family up I think he had two kids
[1:45:36] under two years old he was 24 years old
[1:45:39] he got on us a boat ride for six weeks

[1:45:46] that's not good enough I don't want to
[1:45:47] come to Canada I want to be a US citizen
[1:45:49] and he kept working for another four or
[1:45:52] five years in Canada to finally got a
[1:45:53] job that allowed him to transfer into
[1:45:55] the US and he became a US citizen now
[1:45:57] you know what happens is that that man
[1:46:00] got all that from reading a book he got
[1:46:03] the inspiration he got everything just
[1:46:05] from reading a book or reading multiple
[1:46:06] books about what America was like so and
[1:46:08] again he was under certain atmosphere
[1:46:11] and it produced that if it do that thing
[1:46:14] if it do something like that naturally
[1:46:16] then what can we do spiritually amen
[1:46:20] it's one thing to tell our kids to get
[1:46:21] the Holy Ghost but there's another thing
[1:46:23] to put them in an atmosphere where they
[1:46:26] can receive
[1:46:28] all right lord help us God all right so
[1:46:35] came us down from heaven or Russia right
[1:46:37] away in the atmosphere was right it
[1:46:39] takes an atmosphere to do anything you
[1:46:41] know the regular procedure to hatch
[1:46:43] chickens is to put them under the hand
[1:46:45] but get the egg in the right atmosphere
[1:46:48] it'll hatch anyhow listen brother if a
[1:46:52] man loves God and the right kind of an
[1:46:54] atmosphere he could get into it'll
[1:46:57] produce a newborn baby just as certain
[1:47:01] as I'm here it's the atmosphere that
[1:47:04] cows let this little handful of people
[1:47:08] sitting here tonight getting perfect at
[1:47:11] getting the perfect atmosphere watch
[1:47:14] what takes place amen
[1:47:17] there will not be a fearful among one in
[1:47:21] our midst of the cripples we're left if
[1:47:24] we had the right atmosphere right the
[1:47:26] blind will see the Deaf will hear the
[1:47:30] dumb will speak without prayer or
[1:47:33] anything the atmosphere if the aperture
[1:47:39] is right people can be here without
[1:47:41] nobody even laying hands on him people
[1:47:46] can get delivered from spirits without
[1:47:50] nobody laying hands on them if the
[1:47:52] atmosphere is right Oh going to God
[1:47:58] that's why that's why we take our
[1:48:01] family's place we're up to a church
[1:48:02] where we know the right atmosphere is
[1:48:03] being created a man I don't I don't want
[1:48:07] to see you keep living and seeing
[1:48:08] there's one thing that caught us in but
[1:48:09] don't don't see and see you got to come
[1:48:11] out of it some kind of way but the only
[1:48:13] we gonna get out cuz they delegate a
[1:48:15] struggle in your life
[1:48:16] I mean if sometimes people really want
[1:48:19] to be free and they don't know really
[1:48:21] what to do they they kind of get caught
[1:48:23] in something and what do I do here all I
[1:48:25] can take just giving to the right
[1:48:26] atmosphere and you stir in the right
[1:48:28] atmosphere God will do what he said
[1:48:30] you'll do
[1:48:31] glory to God amen it can happen without
[1:48:35] prayer amen
[1:48:37] it's the act must fear it's the
[1:48:40] atmosphere that's best that's what this
[1:48:42] whole thing is all about is trying to
[1:48:44] create the right atmosphere all right
[1:48:48] all right okay let me just kind of slip
[1:48:51] over here to a quote at Ephesian Church
[1:48:53] age I don't even know what time I got
[1:48:56] started don't know how long I've even
[1:48:57] been up here man I'm loaded with notes
[1:49:02] up here now I don't want to weigh out a
[1:49:04] lot but my whole focus is we want to
[1:49:07] light the fire again in our it's coming
[1:49:09] from from this now like I was telling
[1:49:11] this to brother smile and say you know
[1:49:13] this is our theme but we want to light
[1:49:15] the fire again you say that some of them
[1:49:16] need to light the fire the first time so
[1:49:22] they can light it again they need to get
[1:49:23] it lit the first time I said no that's
[1:49:25] true that's true but I'm pulling my
[1:49:28] thought from this quote a man I read
[1:49:31] this and brother Troy called it and he
[1:49:34] repeated it back to me when he repeated
[1:49:35] back to my saying that's our theme for
[1:49:37] the meeting you know so here it is in a
[1:49:39] Ephesian Church age a paragraph 88 one
[1:49:43] the Prophet says this it says revelation
[1:49:46] 2 4 nevertheless I have somewhat against
[1:49:50] thee because thou has left that first
[1:49:52] love now and this is a problem in the in
[1:49:55] the early church that where they left
[1:49:57] the first love and I can tell you that
[1:49:59] problems still exist today people have
[1:50:01] left their first love right and when you
[1:50:04] leave you leave your first love which
[1:50:06] should be God right that's when you get
[1:50:08] trapped into stuff that you should never
[1:50:10] Gaven got involved with right but but
[1:50:12] but you know God don't want to leave you
[1:50:14] there he hasn't he has provisions made
[1:50:16] for you to come out of that situation
[1:50:17] that you're in right they may he's a
[1:50:21] good good father a man a man he's a
[1:50:26] great father glory to God he's not like
[1:50:29] a earthly father the earthly father get
[1:50:32] disappointed in just old man just forget
[1:50:34] about it but not God gotta be right
[1:50:37] there with you right through thick and
[1:50:39] thin already knowing what she was gonna
[1:50:41] do and then he he'd just be waiting to
[1:50:43] just kind
[1:50:43] throw his arms around you as soon as you
[1:50:46] read it for him he ready for you and
[1:50:48] I'ma tell you can go thousands of miles
[1:50:51] to get away from him but when you make
[1:50:53] one turn towards him do you realize you
[1:50:56] only got to make one step and he's right
[1:50:59] there and you might have taken a
[1:51:00] thousand steps from him but as you go
[1:51:02] he's following you he's just walking
[1:51:07] with you and he's watching over you even
[1:51:09] and you'll see him he don't want you to
[1:51:12] die like that
[1:51:13] you could have died many a times but but
[1:51:15] he's watched over you but no no don't
[1:51:17] touch him
[1:51:18] I know dance they say they love me yet
[1:51:20] but you came touching right you can't
[1:51:22] you came to this you cannot know you
[1:51:24] came to it and he just wait for you to
[1:51:26] make that turn soon and make your turn
[1:51:27] he right there with open arms ready to
[1:51:30] embrace you oh what a glorious father we
[1:51:33] have he says nevertheless I have
[1:51:35] somewhat against it because I was left
[1:51:37] thy first love to understand this you
[1:51:40] must realize that the Spirit is not
[1:51:41] speaking to the original saints of
[1:51:43] Ephesus alone right he says this message
[1:51:48] is to the entire age which lasted about
[1:51:51] 120 years its message then is to all
[1:51:56] generations in that span now history
[1:51:59] keeps repeating itself in the
[1:52:02] generations of of Israel we see revival
[1:52:06] in one generation only to see the fires
[1:52:09] fading in the next and the third
[1:52:12] generation embers may be glowing
[1:52:16] slightly but in the fourth there may be
[1:52:19] no vestige whatsoever of that original
[1:52:22] flame see that and that's if we're if
[1:52:26] we're honest with ourselves that's
[1:52:28] exactly where we are right so you know
[1:52:30] brother Branham comes on the scene and
[1:52:32] and you know different things happen in
[1:52:35] his ministry I've been reading the book
[1:52:37] here brother Peregrine about Acts of the
[1:52:40] Prophet and he's sharing testimonies of
[1:52:43] just things that he went through the
[1:52:45] things that he was an eyewitness of and
[1:52:47] want one particular situation the
[1:52:50] Prophet told this one brother that was
[1:52:53] manager of setting up his meeting say
[1:52:55] now when
[1:52:56] you do put me in a hotel where the
[1:52:59] people don't know where I'm at because I
[1:53:00] won't get no sleep at all because once
[1:53:02] the people find out where I'm at they'll
[1:53:03] be coming to the room trying to actual
[1:53:04] prayer and I won't get in sleep so put
[1:53:06] me in it put me in a room where nobody
[1:53:09] knows where I met nobody he said the
[1:53:11] only person you let know where I met is
[1:53:13] maybe the pastor that's that's helping
[1:53:14] the sponsor to meetings he said okay
[1:53:16] we'll do that so you know and and the
[1:53:20] brother had you know set up the hotel
[1:53:21] and he told the pastor and it's in our
[1:53:23] brother brand I'm gonna call you when
[1:53:25] he's coming and that way you can meet
[1:53:26] him at the hotel and everything like
[1:53:28] that so they they go through the evening
[1:53:30] and no call and they get all the way
[1:53:33] late in the night and no call all right
[1:53:35] Wow
[1:53:36] you know we expected him to call maybe
[1:53:38] he's not coming so you know maybe
[1:53:39] something is not right or whatever so I
[1:53:41] said well we'll just you know going up
[1:53:43] to the hotel and everything and they got
[1:53:45] to the hotel in the hotel attendants
[1:53:48] area Reverend Branham checked in hours
[1:53:50] ago now he never been to this city how
[1:53:55] do you know what hotel that we were in
[1:53:58] right and and and brother peregrym mayor
[1:54:02] Greene beginning to realize this man is
[1:54:04] a prophet God would show him the exact
[1:54:07] hotel where the reservation was without
[1:54:10] nobody telling him where it was and he
[1:54:12] would go check in now how many people
[1:54:16] you know can do that right I mean God
[1:54:21] will reveal things to him he said he
[1:54:22] said I just had a way of just knowing
[1:54:24] things it was God showing everything God
[1:54:26] showed that prophet right I mean you
[1:54:28] know we're not playing games here when
[1:54:30] we talk about a prophet right
[1:54:32] I mean I mean if you just read you know
[1:54:34] again this is atmosphere if if you got
[1:54:36] into the same atmosphere then I put
[1:54:38] myself in what I did when I first heard
[1:54:40] this message I actually went to start
[1:54:42] reading about his life story I read that
[1:54:45] for myself right
[1:54:47] I rather than take what the internet see
[1:54:48] it I read I read his personal testimony
[1:54:51] of his life who better can tell you
[1:54:54] about they life than the person that's
[1:54:56] living it
[1:54:59] how you gonna tell me about my wife
[1:55:02] right it's gonna make no sense right but
[1:55:06] but you know here I read his own person
[1:55:07] just when I began to just be sum of
[1:55:09] things until when you listen to other
[1:55:11] people that was their texture five
[1:55:13] pounds like there's something to this
[1:55:15] there's a lot more to this than what
[1:55:17] people saying it's just scarecrows out
[1:55:19] there all right but you know but but
[1:55:22] here you know as as we look at it you
[1:55:24] know brother brother Peregrine would
[1:55:26] come and as I'm reading a book man so
[1:55:28] many other things that he shared you
[1:55:30] know you know weren't one of these
[1:55:34] things that I was just reading this week
[1:55:35] you know over an and and and and in Luke
[1:55:39] 4 there was a scripture and I mean I
[1:55:42] read this real quick I mean I wasn't
[1:55:46] planning on saying this but the Holy
[1:55:47] Spirit know all things but Luke look for
[1:55:50] a man is something that I'll read here
[1:55:58] we had a word prophet the word prophet
[1:56:03] now I got to try to read this real quick
[1:56:06] if I can't Luke 4 verse 16 and it came
[1:56:11] to Nazareth where he had been brought up
[1:56:13] and as his custom was he went into the
[1:56:15] synagogue on the Sabbath day and stood
[1:56:17] up for the read now the first thing I
[1:56:18] want you to understand and say it was
[1:56:20] Jesus custom to go to church hello I'm
[1:56:24] gonna say that again
[1:56:25] it was Jesus custom to go to church and
[1:56:30] and you think you gonna get by with just
[1:56:35] half half half way attendant things
[1:56:38] Jesus custom let's go to church right
[1:56:41] there was delivered unto Him the book of
[1:56:43] the prophet Isaiah and when they had
[1:56:45] opened the book he found the place where
[1:56:47] it was written the Spirit Lord is upon
[1:56:49] me because he hath anointed me to preach
[1:56:51] the gospel to the poor he has sent me to
[1:56:53] heal the brokenhearted to preach
[1:56:55] deliverance to the captives and
[1:56:56] recovering of sight to the blind to set
[1:56:58] at liberty them that are bruised to
[1:57:00] preach the acceptable year of the Lord
[1:57:01] and notice verse 20 and he closed the
[1:57:03] book and gave it again to the minister
[1:57:04] and sat down and the eyes of all them
[1:57:07] that were in the synagogue were fastened
[1:57:08] on him and he began to say unto them
[1:57:10] this day
[1:57:12] the scripture fulfilled in your ears now
[1:57:15] there was something significant that
[1:57:17] happened in brother branham's ministry
[1:57:18] if you notice here that was looked for
[1:57:20] but he said he opened to isaiah so let's
[1:57:24] go over here as a a' chapter 60 I
[1:57:28] believe Amen let's read something in
[1:57:31] there and there's a couple things that
[1:57:35] happened Jesus read to a certain part in
[1:57:37] the Book of Isaiah and they closed the
[1:57:39] book and said this day the scriptures
[1:57:41] were filled now 61 Azir 61 Jesus was
[1:57:52] reading Isaiah 61 when it when he said
[1:57:55] that another Peregrine happened to be in
[1:57:58] a service one day and brother Branham
[1:58:00] preached a message on birth pains and
[1:58:03] when he went to preach this sermon on
[1:58:04] birth pains he was actually showing how
[1:58:07] this was going to be a time of vengeance
[1:58:09] you know that God was going to be
[1:58:11] pouring out his wrath upon the people
[1:58:13] for their sand and things like that and
[1:58:15] you know but he said the only safe place
[1:58:17] that you could find is in Christ
[1:58:19] now before brother Branham preaches
[1:58:21] discernment in birth pains what happened
[1:58:22] as he was going to church his wife had
[1:58:25] just bought him a gift bought him a new
[1:58:26] Bible and now he had never used this
[1:58:28] Bible before he just grabbed it you know
[1:58:30] kind of off the shelf and just took off
[1:58:32] running the church out real fast and
[1:58:34] never used the Bible once before God the
[1:58:36] church opened up his scripture reading
[1:58:38] that morning and and as we began to read
[1:58:40] the scripture he knew what the verse
[1:58:42] said but somehow the the pages were
[1:58:45] stuck together and he couldn't read you
[1:58:48] know what wait what he wanted to read it
[1:58:50] was just like meant something wrong and
[1:58:52] he say he was looking so you know he
[1:58:53] just didn't understand what was going on
[1:58:54] so there was a bunch of Ministers on the
[1:58:57] platform that day and as they were they
[1:58:59] were all sitting there you know on the
[1:59:01] platform only one decided to get up and
[1:59:05] give brother Branham his Bobby say my
[1:59:06] brother's ain't such a set written in
[1:59:08] this particular chapter he said well how
[1:59:10] come I don't see it in my Bobby he
[1:59:11] didn't realize the pages were stuck
[1:59:12] together so a Catholic priests and his
[1:59:15] Catholic guard got up and say hey hold
[1:59:19] steady young man God is doing something
[1:59:21] he say read it out of my Bible like
[1:59:24] Catholic priests gave him the Bible now
[1:59:27] I want you to stay with me on this
[1:59:29] because Jesus when he went to the temple
[1:59:32] it was the priests that gave him the
[1:59:35] Bible and he picked it up and he began
[1:59:39] to read Isaiah 61 but he got to a
[1:59:42] certain spot and I said 61 and he
[1:59:44] stopped now watch this here in Isaiah 61
[1:59:49] a man the spirit of Lord God is upon me
[1:59:51] because the LORD hath anointed me to
[1:59:53] preach good tidings unto the meek he has
[1:59:55] sent me to bind up the brokenhearted to
[1:59:58] proclaim Liberty to the captives and the
[1:59:59] opening of the prison to them that are
[2:00:01] bound now watch this to proclaim the
[2:00:03] acceptable be able or it now if you go
[2:00:04] back to Luke 4 you'll see Jesus stop
[2:00:07] right there
[2:00:08] where it said it's the priest except
[2:00:09] we'll be in the Lord but notice what
[2:00:11] Isaiah prophesied and the day of
[2:00:13] vengeance of our God to comfort all that
[2:00:16] mourn now Isaiah prophesized that Amen
[2:00:20] somebody is going to Brooklyn the chapel
[2:00:22] year of the Lord and the day of
[2:00:24] vengeance so here when the Catholic
[2:00:26] priest gives brother Branham the book
[2:00:28] and he preaches on birth pangs he is
[2:00:31] actually fulfilling the second part of
[2:00:33] description that's why the Catholic
[2:00:39] priests had to be the one oh my when I
[2:00:42] thought about it you know God ordained
[2:00:45] that name to grow up in a house to learn
[2:00:49] Catholic traditions that he would become
[2:00:51] a Catholic priest someday dress in the
[2:00:55] GAR woke up and give the Papa the Bible
[2:00:59] God predestinated that man to be there
[2:01:02] to do that and honor for the rest of the
[2:01:05] scripture the people feel you go back to
[2:01:12] listen to birthdays just see it was all
[2:01:14] right there and you know we you know I
[2:01:16] hate to see that people falling out over
[2:01:19] simple things but we had a prophet come
[2:01:22] and and fulfill Scripture you know and
[2:01:25] you know brother Peregrine sharing all
[2:01:27] these things I began to think about him
[2:01:28] being a part of a particular generation
[2:01:30] but God has called him off the scene now
[2:01:34] the testimony that he shared it
[2:01:35] certainly impacted my generation I'd be
[2:01:38] what we call third generation right I'm
[2:01:42] one of them in the third generation I
[2:01:43] just believe this I might not have
[2:01:46] experienced all the things that they
[2:01:47] experienced but I yet believe it but
[2:01:52] something's happened in the fourth
[2:01:53] generation we just got in verse now we
[2:01:58] got a few that believe it but there has
[2:02:00] never been an onslaught against the
[2:02:04] generation of people then the generation
[2:02:07] that's on the earth today and this is
[2:02:10] why this quote means so much to me when
[2:02:12] we go back here Ephesian Church age
[2:02:14] again it says in the generations of
[2:02:16] Israel we see revived in one generation
[2:02:19] only to see the fire fading in the next
[2:02:22] and the third generation ampers maybe
[2:02:25] glowing slightly we're trying to create
[2:02:28] atmospheres hey man we don't want just
[2:02:30] involute wanted to be on fire
[2:02:32] right Amber's maybe going blowing
[2:02:35] slightly but in the fall there may be no
[2:02:38] vestige whatsoever of that original
[2:02:40] flame and if that's not where we are are
[2:02:47] you telling me where we are there might
[2:02:50] be no vestige amen whatsoever of that
[2:02:54] original frame people don't even believe
[2:02:56] that sent a prophet no more no mass
[2:02:59] niche of the original flame that's just
[2:03:01] three or four generations removed right
[2:03:04] but the quote don't stop there even when
[2:03:09] it gets in that condition the quote goes
[2:03:12] on it says then God lights the fire
[2:03:17] again and that's where we are
[2:03:20] Church they're trying to see God
[2:03:22] the fire again in the past inhalation
[2:03:28] let God like the fire team let that
[2:03:32] destroy his people again
[2:03:34] oh my you know you go back and look at
[2:03:40] Joel's prophecy it was four stages
[2:03:42] there's four stages of the same bug but
[2:03:46] after that fourth stage guys say I will
[2:03:48] restore sayeth the Lord
[2:03:50] the Palmer arm the King corner of the
[2:03:53] caterpillar locust four stages of the
[2:03:54] same bug but God promised to restore so
[2:03:57] I'm not leaving them where they are I'm
[2:03:59] just showing you where we are but we're
[2:04:01] expecting God to light the fire again
[2:04:05] let me finish reading the quote now I'll
[2:04:08] go into the scripture and I'll let you
[2:04:09] go here today alright says then God
[2:04:11] likes to fire again and the same process
[2:04:14] is repeated it is simply the
[2:04:17] manifestation of the truth that God has
[2:04:19] no grandchildren salvation is not passed
[2:04:22] on by natural burp just because you was
[2:04:24] born in this message don't mean nothing
[2:04:26] you still have to have a personal
[2:04:29] experience with Jesus Christ
[2:04:31] your mama was brought you up in it your
[2:04:34] daddy brought you up into it but you
[2:04:35] ain't had a personal experience with
[2:04:36] Christ you've had an intellectual
[2:04:39] experience but we talk about a personal
[2:04:41] experience alright this is says it is a
[2:04:45] simply a manifestation of truth that God
[2:04:46] has no grandchildren salvation is not
[2:04:48] passed on by natural birth any more then
[2:04:51] there is any truth to apostolic
[2:04:54] succession it isn't in the word you
[2:04:56] start out with truly born again
[2:04:57] believers and when the next generation
[2:04:59] comes along they are no longer just
[2:05:02] playing Christians but they are taking a
[2:05:05] denominational name and are now Baptists
[2:05:08] Methodists that is exactly what they are
[2:05:11] - they are not Christians you have to be
[2:05:16] born on the will of God not the will of
[2:05:18] man to be saved but these folks are all
[2:05:20] coming together now by the will of man I
[2:05:22] don't say that some of them aren't right
[2:05:23] with God not for a minute do I say that
[2:05:26] but the original fire has died down and
[2:05:29] they are not the same anymore so now
[2:05:33] that takes us over here to Joshua
[2:05:36] if we could just look at that again
[2:05:41] I'm sorry judges we were in the book of
[2:05:43] Judges and now so brother Branham
[2:05:46] brought out that this this this this
[2:05:49] thing happened in Israel revival on one
[2:05:51] generation only to see the fires fading
[2:05:53] in the next generation so it happened in
[2:05:55] Israel and we're picking this up here in
[2:05:58] the book of Judges notice this verse 7
[2:06:02] says and the people serve the Lord all
[2:06:04] the days of Joshua ok let's keep going
[2:06:10] they serve the Lord all the days of City
[2:06:13] have respect for him right they knew God
[2:06:16] was with him right and as long as Joshua
[2:06:20] was living and knowledge oshawa but
[2:06:22] notice this says the people say the Lord
[2:06:24] all the days of Joshua and all the days
[2:06:28] of the elders that outlived asura so all
[2:06:30] the people that was along in Joshua's
[2:06:32] generation the Caleb's that was there
[2:06:34] they serve the Lord because they
[2:06:36] understood what God did for them and
[2:06:38] that thought went with that in place and
[2:06:40] then they have respect for these men so
[2:06:42] it's very easy for them to serve the
[2:06:44] Lord
[2:06:45] but God don't have grandchildren they
[2:06:49] never had a personal experience look at
[2:06:52] this he said he says so and all the days
[2:06:54] of the elders that outlived Joshua who
[2:06:56] ain't seen oh my god when they seen all
[2:07:01] the great works of the Lord that he did
[2:07:03] for Israel now these are the people that
[2:07:05] experienced Donovan in a particular way
[2:07:07] so they were convinced ain't no way you
[2:07:10] would have been able to tell Peregrine
[2:07:12] that God didn't sent a prophet this man
[2:07:15] in a hotel room and I made room
[2:07:17] reservations and say he'll call me when
[2:07:19] he get here hey give me any good hotel
[2:07:22] if I'm at the man the Lord he checked
[2:07:24] him for hours ain't no way you're gonna
[2:07:26] tell him that God did send a prophet
[2:07:28] way too many experiences like that for
[2:07:31] him not to believe he's going to take a
[2:07:33] lot more than a bridge
[2:07:36] it's gonna take a lot more than that to
[2:07:38] shake a man like him and that's why you
[2:07:42] didn't see this book released in that
[2:07:44] thing they waited to these people that
[2:07:47] [Music]
[2:07:50] didn't hit the earth
[2:07:52] but while they were here nobody had no
[2:07:54] questions but because they see a
[2:08:26] intellectual birthday don't get it
[2:08:29] people got to have an experience with
[2:08:31] God here we gotta have a true Holy Ghost
[2:08:34] experience and not just one you need to
[2:08:39] be put by mean the rain falls off I'm
[2:08:43] totally nervous every time we come
[2:08:46] together we ought to be entering in man
[2:08:50] I tell you I feel like preaching I feel
[2:08:52] like preaching I heard I heard this guy
[2:08:55] last night you know he was preaching
[2:08:57] about the the word praise and he said in
[2:09:02] the Book of Psalms the word praise has
[2:09:04] seven different Hebrew meanings and boy
[2:09:08] he started going through the Mina's and
[2:09:09] told on and whatever the other ones was
[2:09:13] I can't even think but I'm gonna have to
[2:09:16] go get at him and preach it myself
[2:09:17] right but up but I think the total was
[2:09:20] the extension of the hands and they say
[2:09:23] say when you extend your hands and
[2:09:25] praise that's not only just praise him
[2:09:27] for what he done but a totai praise was
[2:09:31] appraised to thank God for what he was
[2:09:33] getting ready to do
[2:09:36] and some of us need ourselves a total
[2:09:40] please stop letting the devil drown your
[2:09:47] fire
[2:09:47] and then you need to just keep pace
[2:09:50] already para to all that the father's
[2:09:54] giving me real or etekaaf say you the
[2:10:11] truth now I'm gonna hear that lumber
[2:10:13] probably bring it bring a whole series
[2:10:15] on Friday nights amen on them seven
[2:10:17] Hebrew names appraised and what they
[2:10:19] what they what they mean and I know that
[2:10:22] the the the the nominal church world
[2:10:25] probably been preaching it for years
[2:10:26] that's all they can they can't read
[2:10:32] these quotes that's all they got but I
[2:10:34] can take that and add a little bit more
[2:10:36] to it all right
[2:10:37] praise the Lord a man he read in the
[2:10:43] scripture that's what I want to try to
[2:10:45] just make this picture plain to you a
[2:10:47] man so here we're looking at them and
[2:10:51] and and that he's that here's the
[2:10:53] children of Israel and verse 70 or
[2:10:55] judges to the people served the Lord all
[2:10:57] the days of Joshua and all the days of
[2:10:59] the elders that outlived Joshua who had
[2:11:02] seen all the great works of the Lord
[2:11:04] that he did for Israel right and Lotus
[2:11:07] dose notice this and Joshua the son of
[2:11:10] nun the servant of the Lord died being a
[2:11:13] hundred and ten years old and they
[2:11:15] buried him in the border of his
[2:11:17] inheritance in Timnath harris and the
[2:11:20] amount of ephraim on the north side of
[2:11:23] the hill - now now had they come up with
[2:11:25] anything in Joshua's dave Joshua would
[2:11:28] have sniffed that thing I said no no no
[2:11:29] no I remember when God did this for
[2:11:31] Moses and I remember when God said this
[2:11:33] I was there you can't tell me nothing
[2:11:36] right but when Josh was off the scene
[2:11:38] they don't have anybody tech that can
[2:11:40] respond like that that's why the devil
[2:11:43] waited to these warriors a man these
[2:11:46] generals went off to sing
[2:11:48] in order to release this attack on the
[2:11:50] bride listen look look at what happened
[2:11:53] in verse 10 and also all that generation
[2:11:56] would gather to their father so here we
[2:11:58] talk about Joshua is gone and now the
[2:12:00] elders are going the ones that outlive
[2:12:02] Joshua's now they're going look and also
[2:12:05] all that generation were gathered unto
[2:12:06] their fathers and there are rules
[2:12:09] another generation after them listen
[2:12:12] which knew not the Lord what a powerful
[2:12:19] statement some of them think they know
[2:12:22] God but they knew not the Lord and not
[2:12:26] only that yet the works which he had
[2:12:29] done for Israel so since they had not
[2:12:31] experienced God the way the former
[2:12:33] generation had experienced God they were
[2:12:36] not able to hold to the word you know
[2:12:41] let me just tell you you know the first
[2:12:43] generation would have been Moses time
[2:12:45] and in Moses time just think about all
[2:12:47] the people and what they were what they
[2:12:49] would have experienced you know you know
[2:12:52] Moses no mass Jehovah Moses you know and
[2:12:57] no investor hope it means that he was
[2:12:59] Jehovah means that he gave man to be an
[2:13:03] amateur God so Moses had the ability to
[2:13:05] the call for different things and the
[2:13:08] power to bind and loose he lure mastery
[2:13:10] over they that generation saw the the
[2:13:14] rod of Moses turning to a snake and then
[2:13:17] not only that they saw Moses snake eat
[2:13:20] the snakes of Janus and Jambres not now
[2:13:23] I want you to understand that this from
[2:13:27] what my understanding from my just my
[2:13:29] little research I could be wrong on this
[2:13:32] but my little research that I did I
[2:13:33] found out that there was only one snake
[2:13:36] that actually eat other snakes and then
[2:13:39] and this happened to be you know a king
[2:13:43] cobra a king cobra will eat any other
[2:13:46] cobra right any other state a king cobra
[2:13:49] will do that he'll eat regular Cobras if
[2:13:51] you have to right but but but some what
[2:13:54] I realize is that maybe Janus and
[2:13:56] Jambres around some cobras
[2:13:57] but Moses
[2:14:04] God gave Moses a king cobra they - no
[2:14:14] codebase but Moses had a king cobra and
[2:14:20] that's where that king cobra eat up the
[2:14:22] other Cobras and Moses just reached out
[2:14:24] and picked them up anybody else is
[2:14:30] afraid of a cobra snake that's why you
[2:14:32] go back to your read the book of Exodus
[2:14:33] when Moses first tear down the road and
[2:14:35] saw that thing turn into a snake that's
[2:14:37] not a snake a king cobra lonely start
[2:14:40] running but God took that fear out of
[2:14:43] Moses walk that man took such a brother
[2:14:47] - you touch him by the tail and watch
[2:14:51] watch what happened had to walk by faith
[2:14:53] touched him by the tail and he went back
[2:14:55] to stick lord have mercy
[2:14:57] he probably said lord please don't make
[2:14:58] me do that memo but when they got down
[2:15:00] there when they got down there to Egypt
[2:15:03] you know that rot you would undid this
[2:15:06] before
[2:15:07] throw it down there and Moses might not
[2:15:10] have known what he had he probably know
[2:15:13] he had a king cobra sometimes you don't
[2:15:16] realize what you got
[2:15:21] what do you got you got the King of
[2:15:25] Kings and the moses wrought turned into
[2:15:35] that snake and that snake ate the snakes
[2:15:39] of Janice and Jane Janice and Jane
[2:15:41] breeze that generation saw water turned
[2:15:45] into blood for seven days that
[2:15:48] generation saw frogs come out of nowhere
[2:15:50] because Moses called for it they saw
[2:15:52] lights come out of nowhere
[2:15:54] because Moses called for then they saw
[2:15:56] flies come a man from nowhere because
[2:16:00] Moses come for that when it sort of
[2:16:04] flies they recognize that the Flies was
[2:16:06] only in Egypt but not in Goshen right
[2:16:09] when the plague on the cattle that was
[2:16:11] only in Egypt but not in Goshen and when
[2:16:14] Moses come for the plague of cattle the
[2:16:17] Bible actually tells us that the Lord
[2:16:20] did the thing it's so bad they say hey
[2:16:29] there so locusts there's no darkness in
[2:16:32] Egypt for three days watch them threes
[2:16:36] but in question there was light right
[2:16:40] and finally saw the death to the
[2:16:42] firstborn if the token had not been
[2:16:45] applied to that house now with all these
[2:16:48] miracles they couldn't help but believe
[2:16:50] God in that generation but it didn't
[2:16:52] stop there
[2:16:53] they experienced the opening of the Red
[2:16:56] Sea they crossed on dry land they
[2:17:00] rejoiced after they saw the Egyptian
[2:17:02] army drowned you talk about a shout in
[2:17:04] good time
[2:17:05] they had a Pentecostal Jew bees and I'ma
[2:17:09] tell you when you see your enemies drown
[2:17:11] you ought to let out a shout
[2:17:15] [Music]
[2:17:18] while they were in the in the wilderness
[2:17:20] they were provided manna and water from
[2:17:22] a rock how does water come out of a rock
[2:17:25] these are the things that these people
[2:17:27] experience but they all dive in the
[2:17:29] wilderness because of their unbelief
[2:17:36] their parents that was born in the
[2:17:39] wilderness underneath Joshua's
[2:17:41] leadership were the ones that went into
[2:17:44] the Promised Land they knew of Joshua's
[2:17:48] experience with the capture of the hosts
[2:17:50] the same way that Moses met a man the
[2:17:52] the met God at the burning bush a man
[2:17:56] and he heard you know I am that I am and
[2:17:59] sending you you know and I come down
[2:18:01] deliver my people and take off his shoes
[2:18:03] because the ground your own is holy
[2:18:04] ground Joshua had the same experience
[2:18:07] but this time what was in the bush the
[2:18:08] pillar fire that was in the bush became
[2:18:11] a man and Joshua saw him as a man as the
[2:18:15] captain hosts and was told the same
[2:18:16] thing take off your shoes you're on the
[2:18:19] holy ground
[2:18:22] they crossed the Jordan just like they
[2:18:25] pairs across the Red Sea and they
[2:18:27] experienced the parting of the water
[2:18:29] right they saw the walls of Jericho come
[2:18:33] down after marching around for seven
[2:18:35] days and and then letting out that great
[2:18:37] shout right they possessed the land
[2:18:40] through many battles and only lost 36
[2:18:43] men after a can fill to obey the Word of
[2:18:46] God
[2:18:46] he stole the clothing and he stole the
[2:18:48] money during the fall of the wall but
[2:18:53] this fourth generation this third fourth
[2:18:56] generation this is you know the ones
[2:18:59] that starting to have problems and this
[2:19:02] is why the Bible is showing us here that
[2:19:05] you know after after Joshua had died and
[2:19:08] after the ones that outlive Joshua now
[2:19:11] we see a group coming home that don't
[2:19:13] know the Lord neither the works which he
[2:19:18] had done for Israel they were all being
[2:19:20] worn by a painted fire but they had not
[2:19:25] experienced their own personal fire
[2:19:27] and let me tell you cannot get warm by a
[2:19:31] painted fire can I go in a little
[2:19:34] further here now there were others in
[2:19:38] that day even though the majority of
[2:19:40] that pulled away they were still some
[2:19:42] that still holding on to the truth and
[2:19:44] this is why you see people like Anthony
[2:19:46] I'll become the first judge in Israel
[2:19:49] you know I feel was the guy that
[2:19:52] actually went to take the mountain amen
[2:19:55] when Caleb said you know you know he
[2:19:57] said give me this mountain well say well
[2:19:59] I need somebody to go up there fight
[2:20:01] with me and obviously I'll take her Jeff
[2:20:04] Seifer I believe it was yeah I'll take
[2:20:06] her Jeff Seifer and he received Caleb's
[2:20:09] daughter as his wife you know it was off
[2:20:11] me of the nephew of Caleb right at that
[2:20:13] point in time which showed that it had
[2:20:15] to be a kinsman redeemer
[2:20:16] I can't preach all that right now but
[2:20:17] maybe one day I bring that sermon back
[2:20:19] around the y'all but I opted Amir was
[2:20:21] still holding on to the word during that
[2:20:23] time okay so now let's pick up here and
[2:20:25] see I just wanted to show you just a
[2:20:28] load of something here Amen and then
[2:20:31] we'll try to let it go but over here and
[2:20:34] and judges 2 and verse 10 again and also
[2:20:38] all of that generation were gathered
[2:20:40] unto their fathers and their rows
[2:20:42] another generation after them which knew
[2:20:44] not the Lord nor yet the works which he
[2:20:46] had done for Israel since they did not
[2:20:49] know the works of what God had done
[2:20:51] watch what happens to them and the
[2:20:54] children Israel did evil in the sight
[2:20:56] allure and served Balaam and they
[2:20:59] forsook the Lord God of their fathers
[2:21:01] which brought them out of land of Egypt
[2:21:03] and followed other gods of the gods of
[2:21:07] the people that were what the people
[2:21:09] that were round about them and bowed
[2:21:11] themselves unto them and provoked the
[2:21:15] Lord to anger now what I want you to see
[2:21:17] is that this generation this 4th
[2:21:19] generation is the generation that went
[2:21:21] back into bondage however is a different
[2:21:25] type of bondage they're not in the
[2:21:28] bondage of their grant they're great
[2:21:29] they're great grandparents that was
[2:21:31] coming out of Egypt that was a physical
[2:21:33] bondage now they have gone into
[2:21:37] spiritual bondage
[2:21:40] because they're no longer serving god
[2:21:41] they're serving bail now can I go a
[2:21:46] little further now by serving bail it's
[2:21:49] still Mickey religious it still make you
[2:21:55] go to church right you still do all the
[2:21:59] all the other things that that everybody
[2:22:01] else do you you still play the music
[2:22:03] you still like brother brother brother
[2:22:05] brother Henry told us you get your
[2:22:07] praise on you still do all that right
[2:22:14] but you're serving a different gods and
[2:22:18] don't realize it you've compromised
[2:22:22] Maria you didn't contain and now because
[2:22:27] there was no containment
[2:22:29] we got people that's bound with
[2:22:31] spiritual leprosy because you didn't
[2:22:35] take it through the proper channels I
[2:22:38] was saying this with brother smiley
[2:22:40] yesterday we almost had another true
[2:22:42] belief you know that the Levites were
[2:22:45] actually on a day to be able to come in
[2:22:48] contact with leprosy and not get sick
[2:22:55] only the Levites could do that anybody
[2:22:59] else that came in contact with leprosy
[2:23:01] they would get sick that's why I had to
[2:23:05] be handled by the pastor
[2:23:11] they could they could they could
[2:23:12] pronounce this and pronounce that deal
[2:23:14] to all the ones that can come in contact
[2:23:15] with leprosy hallelujah but when we got
[2:23:19] everybody else that they're trying to
[2:23:20] answer questions that's why we get
[2:23:24] problems I'm gonna tell you if we do
[2:23:26] things the right way we won't have a lot
[2:23:28] of sick people and don't you think it's
[2:23:32] the reason why your family won't come to
[2:23:34] me it's not because I'm that meaning I
[2:23:40] mean I know I'm not that mean I can be
[2:23:43] hard and I have to be that way
[2:23:45] to be a leader I have to be that way
[2:23:47] other I spoke just run right over you
[2:23:49] but you got to say things a certain way
[2:23:51] some time in order to you're dealing
[2:23:53] with spirits not people's spirits right
[2:23:59] and I've been fighting an intellectual
[2:24:01] spirit for years
[2:24:02] I've been trying you you didn't got it
[2:24:04] yet you got it you got it intellectually
[2:24:06] but when you get it really a few
[2:24:09] relationships something gonna change how
[2:24:12] do I know that because some changed in
[2:24:14] me and it so they serving Balaam and
[2:24:20] notice what the scripture was telling us
[2:24:22] here they begin to follow other guys
[2:24:24] other gods or the people that were round
[2:24:26] about them so this church got something
[2:24:30] going on here we serving what they doing
[2:24:32] oh come on y'all y'all like y'all and
[2:24:35] preach would we eat laughs yeah you know
[2:24:37] you ain't never gree with none of that
[2:24:38] before but now all of a sudden you just
[2:24:40] eaten it all up if this ain't a repeat
[2:24:45] of what happened in scripture see things
[2:24:49] don't happen just to be happening you
[2:24:51] can place these things right back in the
[2:24:53] words look at it say the sort of so they
[2:24:56] begin to follow other gods of the gods
[2:24:58] of the people that were round about them
[2:25:00] and bowed themselves unto them I need
[2:25:04] you to understand something even though
[2:25:05] they bound themselves to these false
[2:25:07] gods they are still the children of
[2:25:11] Israel
[2:25:18] they're still God's children and at some
[2:25:23] point in time God got to bring them out
[2:25:24] of the circumstance that they're here
[2:25:29] what is he doing when he brings them out
[2:25:32] what do you think he's doing lighting
[2:25:38] lighting the fire again can I just
[2:25:47] finish reading and follow other gods of
[2:25:54] the gods of the people that were round
[2:25:55] about them and bowed themselves unto
[2:25:57] them have provoked the other to anger
[2:25:58] nada you know I was sharing this with a
[2:25:59] brother you know Paul said if they
[2:26:02] preach to you another Jesus why would he
[2:26:05] put words like that ain't another Jesus
[2:26:07] I thought there's only one Jesus but why
[2:26:10] would Paul say they preaching another
[2:26:12] Jesus as you know the dark denominations
[2:26:15] they can they can priest Jesus that went
[2:26:17] to Calvary
[2:26:19] but can we preach about the Jesus that
[2:26:21] got up and start doing some stuff after
[2:26:24] Calvary because if you've missed the
[2:26:30] rest of the New Testament it didn't stop
[2:26:33] with just the four Gospels you got to
[2:26:35] get over the revelation now and can you
[2:26:38] preach from that open book right all
[2:26:41] right let's keep going and and and they
[2:26:44] look verse 13 says and they forsook the
[2:26:48] Lord and served a land Astra the anger
[2:26:51] of the Lord was hot against Israel and
[2:26:53] he delivered them into the hands of the
[2:26:54] spoilers that's for them and sold them
[2:26:57] into the hands of their enemies round
[2:26:58] about so that they could not not any
[2:27:00] longer stand before the enemies now I
[2:27:02] want you to understand something else as
[2:27:04] we read this God allow unwanted
[2:27:09] circumstances to put the people in a
[2:27:15] place where would bring them back to
[2:27:17] where they were supposed to be
[2:27:20] let me also say this don't pray that God
[2:27:25] sent I'm one of the circumstances to
[2:27:27] don't pray that now the reason I'm
[2:27:29] telling you don't pray it because these
[2:27:31] are your people and whatever they go
[2:27:34] through you gonna be feeling it too so
[2:27:39] your prayer is not God send them through
[2:27:40] it your friend like God helped me to
[2:27:43] endure what you're getting ready to do
[2:27:45] but see what happened here in scripture
[2:27:48] I mean even often to them I feel and and
[2:27:52] all the others that were holding on they
[2:27:54] were still impacted by what the people
[2:27:56] is going through here but God kept him
[2:28:01] alright little further and he sold them
[2:28:05] into the hands of their enemies round
[2:28:06] about so that they could not any longer
[2:28:09] stand before the enemies with a sort of
[2:28:10] they went out the handle look was
[2:28:12] against them for evil as the Lord has
[2:28:14] said and as the Lord has sworn unto them
[2:28:16] and they were greatly distressed greatly
[2:28:20] distress my god you know you have a
[2:28:25] family they got multiple cars hey
[2:28:27] everybody go on a different way to go to
[2:28:30] church but what God does is start this
[2:28:32] car goes down this car goes down this
[2:28:35] car goes down that we got one car and
[2:28:39] that car goes to a particular church
[2:28:46] that car goes to a particular church I
[2:28:51] would say that again
[2:28:52] that car is ordained to go through a
[2:28:59] particular Church you say you want to go
[2:29:02] to church this car will not take you to
[2:29:08] another church y'all think I'm crazy but
[2:29:10] I'm gonna tell metell your test for a
[2:29:12] second this car can't go to another
[2:29:16] Church if I try to go to another Church
[2:29:19] in a turn on me if y'all don't believe
[2:29:26] me I wish brother Mike was here brother
[2:29:29] Mike to tell y'all he was trying to go
[2:29:31] to church and they got to a certain
[2:29:33] street and conviction just fell on them
[2:29:36] he had to turn and go down the street to
[2:29:38] where spirit and truth was you see the
[2:29:43] sign on the front his gospel truth
[2:29:44] tabernacle that Cobb alone and spirit
[2:29:50] and truth that man so ain't no system
[2:29:53] he's trying to go nowhere else now you
[2:29:54] say you want to go to church can i
[2:29:56] actual a question I make sure I'm gonna
[2:29:58] just ask a question I'm trying to get
[2:29:59] out of here I'm trying why is it that if
[2:30:05] you were invited to go to church you
[2:30:07] would actually have no problem going
[2:30:10] with people today Church you could you
[2:30:13] would take them and some kind of
[2:30:15] sometimes enjoy yourself a little bit
[2:30:17] but as soon as you invite them to your
[2:30:23] church
[2:30:27] here you ought to see the spirit that
[2:30:29] come off of them why is that that oughta
[2:30:32] let you know right Dean I'm dealing with
[2:30:34] a spirit right I can go with you
[2:30:39] but you can't go with me what will you
[2:30:42] tell me what's the matter with my church
[2:30:45] will you tell me cuz I know how to
[2:30:48] affected my life so you tell me what's
[2:30:51] the matter with my church all right my
[2:30:55] car's ordained my mind is ordained and I
[2:31:00] think I'd get in trouble if I've tried
[2:31:04] to go somewhere else no no I'm ordained
[2:31:06] I might go visit but I ain't coming to
[2:31:07] state and you know what a visit is
[2:31:12] that's like one week at most two weeks
[2:31:18] but after that I'm done I got to go back
[2:31:23] the way to food is I'm hungry all right
[2:31:28] all right all right all right all right
[2:31:29] all right all right all right all right
[2:31:31] okay all right I wanted to read just
[2:31:37] maybe just one more quote if maybe let's
[2:31:43] see what I got here to that there's a
[2:31:44] lot here
[2:31:50] two quotes one is going to come out of
[2:31:52] the resurrection I want to read this
[2:31:55] because the Prophet actually said it
[2:31:56] right here in West Palm Beach I thought
[2:31:59] it was be appropriate on this this is
[2:32:01] out of the message the resurrection and
[2:32:02] then I got one more than it will let it
[2:32:04] go he says see I don't want to blame you
[2:32:07] people is to pull this where it started
[2:32:10] no wonder that's the damnation of the
[2:32:12] country when Satan's got in the pulpit
[2:32:15] it's the truth failing to preach the
[2:32:18] unadulterated Word of God and the Word
[2:32:20] of God will produce just exactly what it
[2:32:22] said it would do but we explain it all
[2:32:24] the way it's all a way it's for some
[2:32:27] other day so when people even talk about
[2:32:28] attempt you know us doing a tenth we
[2:32:31] explain it all the way I don't want
[2:32:32] nobody explaining what God's they do
[2:32:33] what we're doing it to all right a man
[2:32:36] and if once if one soul come out it was
[2:32:38] worth it all I mean you don't you don't
[2:32:40] control how God reaches people and man
[2:32:43] I mean been on that Main Street coming
[2:32:45] down I'm praying for in it little you
[2:32:47] don't know who passing through there hey
[2:32:49] man we're doing everything we can to see
[2:32:51] God moving our day okay since could you
[2:32:54] imagine some understanding at the
[2:32:56] platform saying baptism of the Holy
[2:32:57] Ghost divine healing that's for another
[2:32:58] day said it's like trying to introduce a
[2:33:01] man freezing to death and paint some
[2:33:04] five for him and say there's a fire fire
[2:33:06] that's what was you came worn by a
[2:33:09] painted fire that was fire one time but
[2:33:12] what about fire now right Holy Ghost had
[2:33:15] power at Pentecost through the first Age
[2:33:17] second agent on down what about this H
[2:33:20] he's the same holder goes today the same
[2:33:22] power the same signs of saying one does
[2:33:24] the same miracles if he can get the same
[2:33:27] kind of faith amongst the people God
[2:33:29] doesn't change now I I passed something
[2:33:33] here today only because the account of
[2:33:35] time but I heard you know system
[2:33:38] engineer that when you invite somebody
[2:33:40] to come to your church they come up with
[2:33:41] all kind of excuses I want to give you
[2:33:43] all a man just a little homework
[2:33:46] assignment a man you can kind of get in
[2:33:48] a channel where I was but there's a
[2:33:51] verse a man Luke 14 verse 15 through 24
[2:33:57] you'll read a man in that particular
[2:34:00] passage of
[2:34:02] I won't have time to read it right now
[2:34:04] but you realize how Jesus gave I've
[2:34:06] talked about a parable of a man given an
[2:34:08] invitation to bring people to the
[2:34:09] marriage supper a man to a great supper
[2:34:12] that the King had had produced but as he
[2:34:14] gave the invitation all the people began
[2:34:15] to come up with all kind of excuses as
[2:34:18] to why they could not come to the supper
[2:34:19] oh my and I'm glad the Lord brought this
[2:34:23] back because brother Branham said that
[2:34:25] in the days of Moses they gave excuses
[2:34:27] in the days of Jesus they gave excuses
[2:34:30] in the days of Noah
[2:34:32] they gave excuses he says that even
[2:34:34] today they give an excuses and what that
[2:34:36] means is that somebody gonna say well I
[2:34:38] can't come to the tent because that's an
[2:34:42] excuse and let me tell you something
[2:34:44] excuses only satisfied the person that's
[2:34:46] making them praise the Lord we got two
[2:34:50] nights pick one at least one that you
[2:34:54] can come and be a part of the services
[2:34:55] praise a lot just pick one right but
[2:34:59] don't come with excuses and no to think
[2:35:01] the other thing that I wanted to read is
[2:35:03] you know I'll get to get you there
[2:35:05] there was three pools inside that
[2:35:08] chapter inside that it's not that pastor
[2:35:09] scriptures he went you know first to try
[2:35:11] to get them all you know get them all to
[2:35:13] come the ones that were invited they
[2:35:14] wouldn't come then he went to you know
[2:35:16] the ones that was sick but the RAM said
[2:35:18] it was a divine healing took place right
[2:35:21] in order to try to fool the people and
[2:35:22] then finally what he did because they
[2:35:25] wouldn't come they begin to make excuses
[2:35:26] too he said finally the last thing that
[2:35:28] happened he said go to the hedges the
[2:35:30] highways of highways and invite anybody
[2:35:33] and that's exactly what the brothers did
[2:35:36] they went right out there with with
[2:35:38] tracts and they hand or in vacations and
[2:35:40] invited anybody we're in the word
[2:35:44] that's what Jesus told us to do we're
[2:35:46] trying to get people to come on
[2:35:48] invitation but somebody has to give the
[2:35:51] invitation alright one last quote here
[2:35:57] Christ identified the same in all
[2:36:00] generations no no that's not right hold
[2:36:04] on that's not right hold on a second
[2:36:15] Oh
[2:36:21] yes yes that is right Christ identified
[2:36:24] the same in all generations look at this
[2:36:27] it says so this week this is my last
[2:36:30] quote and I want to leave this Amen over
[2:36:32] the church this week the rest of this
[2:36:36] week let's put our faith up there like
[2:36:41] really Abraham seat like we're supposed
[2:36:43] to be let's believe God right and then
[2:36:47] we'll pray for the sick and do
[2:36:49] everything we can to help alone and when
[2:36:53] we leave we trust that there would be an
[2:36:56] old-fashioned revival through this
[2:36:58] country here that people will be
[2:37:00] swarming in from everywhere jam up these
[2:37:04] churches and so forth for an
[2:37:07] old-fashioned revival we just passed
[2:37:10] through a great revival last fifteen
[2:37:11] sixteen years we've had great leaders as
[2:37:14] all its broke all history records as far
[2:37:17] as I know history usually a revival
[2:37:19] lasts about three years but this has
[2:37:21] gone on for many years and now the
[2:37:23] revival fires are quieting down the
[2:37:26] enthusiasm of the people is dying off
[2:37:28] and you can see it in the old Temple of
[2:37:30] Vesta in Rome when the fires went out
[2:37:33] the people went home but we're trying to
[2:37:37] rebuild these fires again on every Hill
[2:37:41] that we can I cannot do it
[2:37:43] no minister can it takes all of us
[2:37:45] together and prayer and believing and
[2:37:48] trusting God to see the Holy Spirit
[2:37:50] continue to bless his people as we wait
[2:37:52] on his coming see there is questions you
[2:37:56] know and questions and answers and you
[2:37:58] know people asking questions about why
[2:38:01] don't we see God moving the way that he
[2:38:03] used to move you know they were someone
[2:38:07] asked a question what what seems to be
[2:38:09] wrong in the day that we're living in
[2:38:10] being a believer in following the
[2:38:12] message and the messenger of today when
[2:38:15] you cannot seem to pray pray like you
[2:38:18] would like to brother branham said it's
[2:38:20] because the revival fires has gone out
[2:38:22] that was his answer and then in that
[2:38:25] same questions and answers it said it
[2:38:27] seems among ministers of the word that
[2:38:29] we have little or no burden to pray to
[2:38:32] preach too fast for lost souls
[2:38:34] that might still be out there somewhere
[2:38:35] in the world would you please tell us
[2:38:38] what to do about this condition thank
[2:38:41] you very much brother random for this
[2:38:42] and this answer you know to that says
[2:38:45] preachers a minister don't have burden
[2:38:48] burdens for lost souls
[2:38:49] I believe it's lacking of the revival I
[2:38:52] believe we should still try to pray to
[2:38:55] God to give us passion the lost souls
[2:38:59] until Jesus comes well we're gonna do
[2:39:03] our part and this is part of what we do
[2:39:07] like the fire again god bless you amen
[2:39:13] [Applause]
[2:39:18] have a word of Prayer there God we are
[2:39:23] grateful for what the Holy Spirit is
[2:39:27] doing in this hour where we know that
[2:39:32] you're at at work we know that you're
[2:39:34] moving in God as a church we are trying
[2:39:39] to follow as close as we possibly can we
[2:39:44] don't want to get too far in front of
[2:39:45] you I certainly don't want to be too far
[2:39:48] behind you we want to be in position
[2:39:51] where we can see you move and we can
[2:39:53] enjoy everything that you do so God as
[2:39:58] we prepare for this week first of all I
[2:40:01] pray that you bring all of us into one
[2:40:02] heart into one mind into one Accord if
[2:40:06] there are any excuses that we have Lord
[2:40:10] let us push those things to the side and
[2:40:12] let us not use the same old thing God
[2:40:15] understands God if this doesn't happen
[2:40:19] that often we don't do these things that
[2:40:20] often some of the ones here should be
[2:40:22] sharing the testimonies of what you've
[2:40:24] done for them and if sometimes Satan to
[2:40:26] put so much in their path that they
[2:40:28] can't do what you call them to do we
[2:40:30] read in Sunday school that each one has
[2:40:32] a ministry each one have something that
[2:40:34] they need to do it's not just the past
[2:40:36] it's not just the worship leaders but
[2:40:38] everybody got something that they're
[2:40:40] supposed to be doing god help you people
[2:40:42] find that help help them to find that
[2:40:45] and Lord if they came to nothing else
[2:40:47] they can tell people of
[2:40:48] goodness and the grace and the mercy
[2:40:50] that they have experienced the Lord as
[2:40:53] we prepare to go out Lord to okeechobee
[2:40:58] God we believe that you've already gone
[2:41:01] before us
[2:41:02] we've hearing testimonies already of
[2:41:04] what you've already done we don't know
[2:41:05] who walked through that place but let us
[2:41:08] be spiritual help us to be wise and the
[2:41:12] way that we handle and conduct ourselves
[2:41:13] out there Lord let us let us not be
[2:41:16] clannish when we go but let us look for
[2:41:19] opportunity we can be a witness to
[2:41:22] somebody Lord let us seek out that hey
[2:41:24] let us go through this week just praying
[2:41:26] and fasting and just meditating on what
[2:41:29] we're getting ready to do and and Lord
[2:41:32] the way we feel that you're the same God
[2:41:33] that that left a revival went across the
[2:41:36] sea a stormy sea just to get one soul
[2:41:40] because that one soul was worth more
[2:41:43] Lord than there's so many worlds and God
[2:41:46] that's the way that we feel today one
[2:41:48] soul is worth more than a thousand Lord
[2:41:51] worlds so god help us to be obedient
[2:41:54] amen to the Spirit of God and let us
[2:41:58] give our all we've only gone as far as
[2:42:00] we can because we have not been willing
[2:42:02] to give more of ourselves so Lord if
[2:42:05] there's more to surrender help us to
[2:42:07] surrender that even on today God
[2:42:10] continue to deal with our hearts
[2:42:12] continue to minister to our needs and
[2:42:17] while labor head is bowed I want to miss
[2:42:24] an opportunity there's some here even in
[2:42:26] our myths that do not know Jesus the way
[2:42:28] that you should know Jesus
[2:42:35] and you want to acknowledge in this
[2:42:36] presence that you need them I just want
[2:42:41] you to lift your hands wherever head is
[2:42:43] bowed I want to pray for you one thing
[2:42:46] before we go and do anything we got to
[2:42:48] get to stand out from amongst ourselves
[2:42:52] the devil can be exposed in you if
[2:42:55] you're not clean if you're not pure
[2:42:57] before God there's something in your
[2:43:00] life that's hindering you from having
[2:43:01] true relationship with God I just want
[2:43:06] you to lift your hand right where you
[2:43:07] are I'm not going to ask you to do any
[2:43:09] more than lift your hand I just want you
[2:43:10] to be honest and the presence of the
[2:43:12] Lord that Lord I'm not I'm not where I
[2:43:14] need to be but I want to get there Bible
[2:43:18] says repent be baptized in the name of
[2:43:21] the Lord Jesus Christ for the remission
[2:43:25] of your sins and you shall receive the
[2:43:26] gift of the Holy Ghost as promises unto
[2:43:28] you your children those are the father's
[2:43:29] many if the Lord I got your call if the
[2:43:32] Holy Spirit is still with your heart
[2:43:33] today just slip your hand right where
[2:43:35] you are throw the jack I'm not where I
[2:43:36] need to be and I want it I want to get
[2:43:38] things right with God today I don't want
[2:43:40] to leave this place knowing that my
[2:43:42] heart is not right this might be your
[2:43:44] last chance if your hand right where you
[2:43:47] are God sees their hands God sees the
[2:43:52] hands I'm gonna pray for you while your
[2:43:57] hand is lifted in this presence I just
[2:43:59] want you to also pray along with me and
[2:44:01] your hardened and I believe God would
[2:44:04] meet you and just do the thing that he
[2:44:06] need to do in your heart today father I
[2:44:10] just felt checked in my spirit just to
[2:44:13] make sure Lord that the Saints were
[2:44:18] properly prepared there's one thing that
[2:44:19] go minister to a community out there God
[2:44:22] but when we fail to minister to the
