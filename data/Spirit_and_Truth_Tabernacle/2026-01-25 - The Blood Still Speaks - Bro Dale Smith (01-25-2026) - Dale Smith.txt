TRANSCRIPT
========================================
Fresh. When the music fades, all is stripped away. And I simply come. Oh, longing just to bring something that's will bless your heart. Oh, I'll bring you more than a song. For a song it itself is not what you have required. Oh, you search much deeper within through the way things appear. You're looking into my heart. So I'm coming back.

He brought along his his grandson Isaac. Amen. And so good to have him uh with us. Um Isaac is there in South Carolina, but his grandfather is there out of um out of Arizona. So, uh we'll be looking forward to just hearing what the Lord has placed in his heart in a second. But I wanted to just make a um a a quick request that if we all would also remember um Sister Vera's family in prayer. uh she lost her brother recently and um unexpected death that happened in the family. They'll be having the service on um on next week I have it says Friday, January 30th, they'll be doing the viewing from 6:00 to 8. And then I have on Saturday, January 31st, the service will be at 11 noon. Uh I'm sorry, 11:00 a.m. Not noon, 11:00 a.m. at Union Baptist Church. uh Union Missionary Baptist Church and that's uh 3900 Broadway and uh the rep pastor is going to be at Rivier Beach Marina. We want to remember her family uh in our prayers and um whatever we can do to assist. I know that they uh said that they have the food and everything, you know, for the repass, but if any of our sisters would be able to help serve the family, uh I'm sure that they would be uh blessed, amen, by that at the repass. So, wherever we can get in, uh we want to do that to try to support Sister Vera's family uh during this time. Amen. And um I know that we prayed over Sister Boyd before her surgery, but um I think it's a couple weeks from now and we want to make sure we anoint you with oil before you go in. Amen. Uh to be touched by the doctor. So we'll in a couple weeks we'll make sure that we do that. Amen. For you. Praise the Lord. Let's stand to our feet. Amen. Uh I know that the Lord has a a special blessing for us today. and and um uh brother Dale has just been dear to us throughout the years and the Lord called him uh into pastoral ship. He was evangelizing for a number of years and that's how we got a chance to know him through uh the church in Okchobee and uh he passed our way and and man we just never forget the services that we've had with brother Dale but since he's been pastor hasn't been able to get on the road like that like he used to but he decided to come here and just do a little vacationing little fishing uh what they call it fisherary trip. Yeah, fisherary trip. And uh we're so glad that the Lord let him pass this way. So I know that Amen. God has something in store for us on today. Amen. Let's sing a course of that song. Only believe. Only believe. Amen. As our brother comes to minister to our hearts. Believe. Everybody say only believe. Say God bless you possible. Oh, cuz Lord I believe &gt;&gt; Lord and I believe &gt;&gt; that all are possible. Oh Lord. Oh God, help my unbelief. Oh Lord, I believe. Lord, I believe. All things are possible. was Lord I believe. Amen. We sing the song only believe because it tells us that we're to believe only. &gt;&gt; Amen. There's &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; No room for doubt in the heart of a believer. &gt;&gt; Amen. God bless you, friends. Good to be in the house of the Lord this morning. Good to be with you all. Uh, a lot of water under the bridge. Amen. Since we we're this way, but uh, you know, we we uh we have to just follow the mind of the Lord and and go where he leads us. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And uh do uh what he willth. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord Jesus. Amen. We won't sing anymore this morning. I I'll leave that up to the singers. Amen. But if you have your Bibles this morning, before we let you be seated, we want you to turn into the book of Genesis, chapter 4. And um we want to bring you greetings from the saints in uh in Flagstaff, Arizona, where we reside there with a little church. Uh we we call it North Country Christian Fellowship. It's just a little group of saints waiting on the coming of the Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. And so they uh they don't let me get away too often, but uh when we do, we we try to uh stay busy for the Lord. We don't, you know, I I've I don't think I've ever taken a vacation where I didn't preach somewhere. &gt;&gt; And uh it's just been that way. I I don't think that we have many more opportunities uh for that those kind of things myself and if we want to be busy about the things of God. &gt;&gt; All right. in Genesis chapter 4. And there we want to read uh the ninth and the 10th verses if we may. Uh and uh here in verse 9, the Bible says, "And the Lord came uh unto Cain. Uh the Lord said unto Cain, uh where is Abel thy brother?" And he said, "I know not." What a liar. &gt;&gt; He knew right where he was. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; He says, "Am I brother's keeper?" And he said, "What has thou done? The voice of thy brother's blood crith unto me from the ground." Right. &gt;&gt; And in the book of Hebrews chapter 12 and verse 24, it says, "And to Jesus, the mediator of the new covenant and to the blood of sprinkling that speaketh better things than that of Abel." &gt;&gt; We'd like to title them message this morning, The Blood Still Speaks. Right. &gt;&gt; And we want to go to the Lord in prayer. Heavenly Father, we thank you Lord for the the grand privilege Lord of standing before your people. Lord, the highest honor that any man could know is to Lord to stand before the purchase of your blood. I pray father this morning that we'll be able to convey from our hearts lord those things which are needful for the body of Christ and to encourage this little group Lord this morning I I don't come with any agenda or any preconceived notions Lord just that we may Lord preach Christ and him crucified &gt;&gt; and we pray Lord that you'll bless the people today that you'll heal the sick, Lord, that you'll encourage, Lord, your children. Save the lost, &gt;&gt; Father. May there come such a sweeping, Lord, a power of God that would that would change our hearts, Lord. Make us fit, Lord, for your kingdom. We pray in the allsufficient name of the Lord Jesus. The church said, &gt;&gt; "Amen." &gt;&gt; Amen. As you have your seats this morning, might have to move this pull pit so I'm a little closer to you. &gt;&gt; But uh we'll get used to the the changes are are you know you get kind of in a in a place where you get uh things become common. You become comfortable in your in your own skin that way. But uh you know uh we trust that the Lord will uh have something for us this morning. &gt;&gt; Uh it was snowing at our place uh yesterday, so my wife was even wondering if they would have service today and if she could get out the drive. And uh so I told her, "Don't worry about it. You if it if the car goes, go to church." And so I'm I'm sure everything will be all right. I haven't uh I got wonderful officers and those kind of things uh able to uh hold down the fort while we're away. &gt;&gt; Amen. Paul told the Corinthian church, he made a statement there in uh 1 Corinthians 2 and he says,"For I determined &gt;&gt; not to know anything among you &gt;&gt; save Christ and him crucified." &gt;&gt; That's right. I thought that was striking this morning as I dwelt upon that that he made this statement that I am determined. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; I determined I I I resolved in my heart. I I made this uh uh uh this judgment. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. uh in my heart that I wouldn't uh that I wasn't going to go looking for any other uh uh determination, but that I could that I could convey to you, &gt;&gt; right? &gt;&gt; That Christ died for sinners. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And that that he says of which I am chief. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. And so he made this determined it actually the word determine there uh means to uh to become resolute to make a resolve &gt;&gt; and I I thought it and it just my mind went to this place that that when the president sits behind the desk in his oval office and he's making decision when he's uh uh uh uh making an executive order &gt;&gt; uh that he sets behind the resolution absolute desk, the desk of determination, the desk of of of passing uh uh uh presidential uh uh executive order. Now, unfortunately that when he steps out from behind that desk after a few years of uh of his term of office, then another president can come in behind him and he can change his executive order. you know, he can he can alter that ex executive order as long as it's according to the constitution as long as it's doesn't conflict any laws of the land that HE CAN NOW MAKE THIS resolute uh decision. And so he then determines to know something else. Maybe a a Republican decision or maybe a a DEMOCRAT DECISION or or HE'S GOING TO MAKE SOME DECISION ACCORDING TO HIS to his constituents or or to the lobbyists or whoever would uh grease his palm with a few extra dollars. BUT WHEN PAUL CAME, HE CAME TO MAKE A DECISION BASED ON THE LAW OF LAWS BY THE KING OF KINGS. HE SAID, "I NOT GOING TO DO ANYTHING AMONG YOU, SAVE CHRIST AND HIM CRUCIFIED. I'M GOING TO GIVE YOU WHATEVER YOU NEED TO GET YOU FROM THIS WORLD TO THE WORLD TO COME. AND THE ONLY THING THAT'S GOING TO DO THAT IS THE SHED BLOOD OF AN INNOCENT ONE." THAT GOD HAD TO TAKE MY PLACE. Oh my. When you think about that, &gt;&gt; Amen. Every day Sunday, isn't it? &gt;&gt; All right. &gt;&gt; G, &gt;&gt; brother Brandon makes some tremendous statements along these lines. I' like to, if you'll help me, I'll stay with my notes. Uh, &gt;&gt; it's 10:30. &gt;&gt; So, if I'm done by 11:30, we're good. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; That is that all right? I and I know we have some some time constraints there. We want to be studious of that. Now, &gt;&gt; Brother Bam tells us here. He says, "Now, in those days, they did not have any Bibles." &gt;&gt; So, the only way that Abel could have known how to worship the Lord, &gt;&gt; it had to come by a revelation. &gt;&gt; Praise God. It was revealed to him uh uh some way for the two boys sacrifices was absolutely contrary one to another. &gt;&gt; Right? &gt;&gt; SO THEN NOW WE REALIZE THAT WHEN WHEN CAIN brought his uh his sacrifice when he came to his altar to worship, brother Ram said they both bu were both religious. They both built altars. THEY BOTH BROUGHT SACRIFICE. They both WORSHIPED GOD, BUT ONE WAS ACCEPTED and the other was not. &gt;&gt; And because their uh their their worship and their and their revelations were so contrary, their sacrifices were diverse to each other, totally uh in opposition to the other. &gt;&gt; Amen. So God had uh revealed to Abel by a divine revelation that what would take away sin was blood. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; We find that many places said, "DO YOU SEE CAIN HAD the revelation of his father that it was fruit?" &gt;&gt; All right. &gt;&gt; Or plants. &gt;&gt; All right. All right. &gt;&gt; All right. So, uh, we're going to hit a note here in a moment. He says, uh, uh, uh, the lamb that had been slain before the foundation of the world. Oh my, here it is. &gt;&gt; YES. &gt;&gt; HE ALREADY SAW CHRIST. &gt;&gt; OH MY. BY the revelation that before the foundation of the world, WHEN CHRIST WAS PRONOUNCED to be slain for the sins of the world, ABEL BY FAITH SAW THAT REVELATION. It was REVEALED TO HIM. AND THE ENTIRE BIBLE IS BUILT UPON that revelation. THAT'S RIGHT. &gt;&gt; OH, THINK ABOUT IT, FRIENDS, THAT HERE WAS A HERE WAS A A A YOUNG MAN THAT CAME OUT TO WORSHIP GOD. AND WHEN HE CAME THERE, HE HAD TO CONSIDER IN HIS MIND THAT I IN ORDER FOR ME TO COME INTO THE PRESENCE OF GOD, I HAVE TO GO WITH MY SINS COVERED. &gt;&gt; ALL RIGHT? &gt;&gt; I HAVE TO GO WITH WITH WITH SOME WAY THAT WILL please the the the THE THE EYES OF GOD. &gt;&gt; THAT GOD WAS LOOKING DOWN THROUGH ETERNITY. AND THERE HAD TO BE SOMETHING THAT WOULD PLEASE THIS GOD THAT WE WORSHIP. And so as HE BEGAN TO MEDITATE UPON THAT, HE had to think, "Oh my, THERE IT CAN'T BE THE PLANTS AND THOUGH THEIR FLOWERS ARE BEAUTIFUL AND AND THOUGH ALL THESE THINGS ARE ARE LOVELY FRUITS AND THINGS AND I SEE WHAT MY BROTHER'S DOING, BUT I REALIZE THAT IT WASN'T A SIN BY FRUIT, BUT IT WAS A SIN AGAINST THE BLOOD." &gt;&gt; AND SO THEREFORE, I HAVE TO I HAVE TO APPEASE GOD BY BLOOD. AND SO THEREFORE, SOMETHING INNOCENT HAS TO TAKE MY GUILTY PLACE BECAUSE I'M THE GUILTY ONE. AND THIS INNOCENT ONE HAS TO BE THERE TO DIE. AND NOT JUST FOR ME, BUT INSTEAD of me. &gt;&gt; THAT SOMETHING HAS TO TAKE MY PLACE. &gt;&gt; Oh my glory. And so, Brother Bam tells us that he saw by REVELATION THAT GOD GAVE HIM A VISION OF WHAT TOOK PLACE before the foundation of the world. &gt;&gt; That's good. &gt;&gt; THAT HE LOOKED BACK AND BY SUPERNATURAL INTERVENTION that he WAS ABLE TO LOOK INTO INTO ETERNITY AND SEE THAT SOMETHING HAD DIED IN HIS PLACE, THAT SOMETHING TOOK HIS PLACE. AND SO, HE HAD TO REPLICATE THAT WHAT HE SAW IN HEAVEN. HE HAD TO REPLICATE it upon the earth. &gt;&gt; Oh my. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; And by THAT GOD WAS PLEASED. &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; But to Cain's sacrifice, he had no respect. &gt;&gt; Oh my revelation. &gt;&gt; And so as he offered this lamb, we find that that ABEL'S LAMB WHEN IT DIED, IT IT DIED SPEAKING IN TONGUES. &gt;&gt; AMEN. THAT HAD DIED SPEAKING IN A language that Abel COULD NOT UNDERSTAND. &gt;&gt; OH, IT WAS BLEEDING OUT. ELI, ELI. OH MY. IT WAS IT WAS IT WAS BLEEDING OUT. AMEN. IT WAS BLEEDING OUT. AMEN. WHY? BECAUSE HIS SHEPHERD HAD FORSAKEN HIM. HE WAS BLEEDING OUT BECAUSE HE WAS SUFFERING. HE WAS DYING. HIS TONGUE WAS CLEAVED TO HIS MOUTH. AMEN. THEY WAGGED THEIR HEAD AT HIM. OH, THERE WAS NO BEAUTY WE SHOULD DESIRE IN HIM. AND IT PLEASED GOD TO SMITE HIM. &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. &gt;&gt; And when God's lamb died that day on Calvary, he spoke in a language that no one understood, "My God, my God, why has thou forsaken ME?" IT WAS GOD'S LAMB HACKED TO PIECES. &gt;&gt; THAT'S RIGHT. &gt;&gt; AMEN. And he was the very lamb that Abel had in mind when HE SEEN THE PROMISED seed of the woman. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Oh my. Then now THAT ABEL HAD LOOKED BACK, AMEN, AND SAW WHAT God had done, then he began to look future. And he, oh my, he began to see what was to come because there was a promise. AND THERE WAS A WORD THAT HAD ALREADY BEEN GIVEN. OH MY. To his mother and his father that the that the that the heel of the WOMAN'S SEED WOULD BRUISE THE HEAD OF THE SERPENT. AND HE KNEW THAT THERE HAD TO COME ONE. Oh my. And this one that came, Abel had him in mind. And he saw that he was the promised seed of the woman. &gt;&gt; Praise God. &gt;&gt; He was the lamb that DANIEL SAW HUNED OUT OF the mountain without hands. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; He was the wheel in the middle of the wheel. &gt;&gt; Oh, hallelujah. WHAT WAS THAT WHEEL IN THE MIDDLE OF THE WHEEL? WAS GOD WAS IN CHRIST RECONCILING THE world to himself. Moses said that there would be no remission of sin without the shedding of blood. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; They had all seen it. They saw it and it was all met that day &gt;&gt; on Calvary. &gt;&gt; Amen. THAT DAY ON CALVARY was the day of days. Back in 1944, there was a an operation by the Americans where they uh it was the largest air, land, and sea attack of in in history. And they called it the day of days. &gt;&gt; All right. &gt;&gt; Or D-Day. &gt;&gt; All right. &gt;&gt; And that's where we dropped, you know, thousands and thousands of men uh hit the shores of Normandy, France. And it was uh quite the operation. But I'm here to tell you that that day &gt;&gt; pales, &gt;&gt; ALL RIGHT, &gt;&gt; to the day of days. &gt;&gt; ALL RIGHT. WHEN GOD'S MAN WHEN GOD'S MAN THAT WAS UH UH GOD'S ARNOLD VAN WINKLE REED, IT WAS GOD'S MAN THAT RAN INTO THE THICKEST OF THE ENEMY'S SPEARS. IT WAS GOD'S MAN THAT WENT IN AND PAID THE PRICE FOR all mankind. IT WAS THAT DAY THAT THE BLOOD OF ABEL, AMEN, IT CAN ONLY SPEAK, AMEN, AGAINST CAIN. BUT THIS MAN'S BLOOD SPAKE FOR YOU, CAIN. &gt;&gt; IT SPEAKS FOR YOU THIS MORNING. AND IT'S SPEAKING LOUDER. OH MY. WHAT A MIGHTY tongue &gt;&gt; that this blood has. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; We find then brother tells us, "But it it wasn't fruits. It was the blood." Listen now. It was the blood of Abel's father. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Who made him mortal. &gt;&gt; All right. &gt;&gt; All right. All right. &gt;&gt; BE BE BEFORE ADAM HAD SINNED, before there was this this this GREAT CHAOS THAT CAME BACK INTO THE EARTH BY BY THE SIN of one man. &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; THAT THAT THAT MAN WALKED THE EARTH AS AN IMMORTAL. &gt;&gt; ALL RIGHT. &gt;&gt; HE WALKED AS A SUPERMAN. THAT'S RIGHT. &gt;&gt; HE WALKED AS A GOD MAN UPON THE EARTH. THAT ALL CREATION WAS SUBJECT TO HIM. HE COULD SPEAK TO THE ANIMALS. HE COULD SPEAK TO THE TREES AND THE RIVERS AND EVERYTHING. HE was an immortal. &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; BUT WHEN HE FAILED AND SINNED AGAINST THE BLOOD, WHEN ABEL came forth crying, BLOOD COVERED, &gt;&gt; OH MY. COME BY THE WAY OF THE MATRIX. BORN IN SIN, SHAPED IN INIQUITY. COME IN THE WORLD SPEAKING LIES. ABEL REALIZED THAT IT WAS HIS FATHER'S BLOOD THAT MADE HIM MORTAL. &gt;&gt; PRAISE GOD. &gt;&gt; OH MY. IF HE WOULD HAVE COME BY SPOKEN WORD THE WAY ADAM CAME, THEN HE WOULD HAVE CAME FORTH AS AN IMMORTAL. HE WOULD HAVE HAD THE SAME POWER AS HIS FATHER. BUT NOW HE WAS HE WAS HE WAS A MAN FIT TO DIE. &gt;&gt; WOW. &gt;&gt; PRAISE GOD. He was immortal. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; SO HE CAME AND OFFERED THE BLOOD OF A lamb by revelation. &gt;&gt; No one TO TELL HIM ANYTHING ABOUT IT. &gt;&gt; RIGHT? &gt;&gt; BUT HE BY FAITH HE SEEN THE SON OF GOD COMING AND OFFERED a lamb in a figurative type. &gt;&gt; Seeing that Jesus was a lamb &gt;&gt; slain before the foundation of the world. &gt;&gt; Amen. Charles Spurgeon &gt;&gt; made a statement one time. He said, "The blood of Jesus hath a mighty tongue." &gt;&gt; Wow. &gt;&gt; And the importance of its prevailing cry is not vengeance. &gt;&gt; Wow. &gt;&gt; THAT WHEN THE BLOOD OF JESUS CRIES OUT, OH MY. NOT LIKE ABEL'S BLOOD. &gt;&gt; WOW. &gt;&gt; BUT THIS BLOOD DOESN'T SPEAK OF VENGEANCE. &gt;&gt; IT DOESN'T SPEAK OF WRATH. ALL RIGHT. &gt;&gt; But it speaks of mercy. &gt;&gt; A MIGHTY TONGUE OF GOD THAT IT SPEAKS OF MERCY. WHEN HIS EYE LOOKS UPON HIS PEOPLE, HE LOOKS THROUGH THE EYES OF MERCY. WHEN HE CORRECTS HIS CHILDREN, HE CORRECTS THEM WITH NAIL SCARRED HANDS. AMEN. OH, THAT'S MY JESUS. &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. &gt;&gt; YOU SEE, THE BLOOD OF JESUS speaketh better things than that of Abel. Abel was a righteous man AND HE DIED INNOCENT. Listen to WHAT HE SAYS. BECAUSE HE WAS IN THE WAY. HE WAS IN THE WAY STANDING FOR THE REAL revelation that he had. SO HERE WAS AN INNOCENT MAN WORSHIPING GOD BY THE DICTATES OF HIS HEART BY SPIRITUAL REVELATION. BUT WHEN HE WAS STANDING THERE WORSHIPING GOD IN THAT WAY, HE WAS STANDING IN THE WAY OF his brother getting to God. &gt;&gt; BUT THE WORD SAYS THAT GOD SPOKE TO CAIN AND SAID, "IF YOU'LL DO WHAT YOUR BROTHER DID, &gt;&gt; then you'll BE ACCEPTED ALSO." AND THEY COULD HAVE COME TOGETHER. &gt;&gt; WOW. &gt;&gt; But that brother THAT ABEL WAS STANDING IN THE WAY BECAUSE HE HAD ALREADY SET A divine dictate, A DIVINE UH UH UH uh precedent &gt;&gt; THAT WAS MADE BY ABEL SHOWING THAT IT WAS SIN AGAINST THE BLOOD. AND NOW CAIN WAS GOING TO HAVE TO COME TO THE REVELATION OF THE SERPENT SEED. AND IN ORDER TO COME TO THAT REVELATION, HE WAS GOING TO HAVE TO ACCEPT THE GOSPEL &gt;&gt; THAT Abel was preaching. &gt;&gt; PRAISE THE LORD. &gt;&gt; OTHERWISE, HIS SACRIFICE WOULD NEVER BE ACCEPTED. IT WAS A DENOMINATIONAL revelation that was going to have to come subservient &gt;&gt; to the divine revelation that God had given his prophet in that day. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. Yes, sir. Amen. &gt;&gt; It's an amazing thought. &gt;&gt; Amen. So, uh, the just blood of Abel cried out against Cain. But the blood of Jesus not only cried out, but brother Bram said it redeemed. &gt;&gt; It speaketh better things. Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; It makes you sons and daughters of God. &gt;&gt; It's a reproductive blood. &gt;&gt; THE BLOOD OF JESUS HAS THE blood cell of God that CAN COME INTO THE HUMAN heart and give you new birth. &gt;&gt; YOUR OLD BIRTH WAS BY THE BLOOD OF YOUR FATHER MADE YOU MORTAL. BUT THE BLOOD OF YOUR HEAVENLY FATHER, AMEN, NOW CHANGES YOU, IMPREGNATES YOU, AND MAKES YOU A NEW CREATURE in Christ Jesus. &gt;&gt; Glory. &gt;&gt; It hides you from the wrath of God. The blood of ABEL CANNOT HIDE CAIN, but the blood of Jesus can. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. I love what he says here. HE SAYS, "SO COME OUT." UHUH. So he says, "So Cain, COME OUT TODAY." &gt;&gt; HE CALLED US ALL CAIN. &gt;&gt; MY GOD. &gt;&gt; SO WE CAN ALL COME OUT TODAY. WE DON'T HAVE TO STAY &gt;&gt; IN THAT CONDITION WITH THE MARK OF THE BEAST UPON HIM. WE DON'T HAVE TO STAY THAT WAY. THERE'S A WAY TO COME OUT. THERE'S A WAY TO COME INTO REDEMPTION. THERE'S A WAY TO COME INTO SALVATION. IT DOESN'T MATTER WHAT YOUR CONDITION IS. IF YOU'RE A CAIN OR IF YOU'RE AN ABEL, IF YOU'RE AN ESAU, IF YOU'RE A JACOB, IT DON'T MATTER. AMEN. THE BLOOD OF JESUS CLEANSES us from all sin. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Watch what HE SAYS. &gt;&gt; CAN COME OUT TODAY. IF YOU'VE BEEN A PERSECUTOR AGAINST THE WORD, say the days OF MIRACLES IS PASS. ALL THIS IS NONSENSE. THE BLOOD IS CRYING OUT. THE BLOOD OF JESUS CHRIST CRIES OUT, BUT THERE'S FORGIVENESS in that if you'll just accept it. &gt;&gt; PRAISE GOD. BROTHER B TELLS A STORY OF how that that that there was a gangster AND HE WAS SHOT DOWN IN THE ON THE SIDEWALK in Chicago. &gt;&gt; Uhhuh. &gt;&gt; And there and A BIG IT BLED OUT THERE ON THE SIDEWALK AND THAT LEFT A STAIN on the sidewalk. &gt;&gt; And he said that the people when THEY WOULD COME TO THAT STAIN THEY WOULD WALK AROUND IT. &gt;&gt; THEY WOULDN'T WALK THROUGH THE BLOOD OF THEIR COMRADE. THEY WOULDN'T WALK THROUGH THE BLOOD of one of their fellow men. &gt;&gt; HE SAID, "BUT OH, BUT WHAT ABOUT THE BLOOD OF JESUS?" &gt;&gt; HE SAID, "THEY'LL WALK THROUGH IT WITH HUG NAILED SHOES WHERE ANGELS FEAR TO TROD." AMEN. THEY'LL WALK THROUGH IT WITH BOBBED HAIR AND PAINTED FACES. AMEN. THEY'LL WALK THROUGH IT. AMEN. CIGARETTE SMOKING. AMEN. UH UH. MARIJUANA SUCKING. AMEN. UH UH UH. ALL THESE PIPE SMOKING, CIGAR SMOKING, AMEN. PORNOGRAPHY FIENDS. AMEN. THEY'LL WALK RIGHT THROUGH THE BLOOD OF JESUS WHEN JESUS DIED TO SAVE YOU FROM THOSE THINGS. &gt;&gt; Oh my. There was a preacher one time over in Europe and he was telling the the all these uh uh religions of the world. There was Zekes and James and and there was Muhammads and there was Hindus and BUDDHISTS AND ALL THESE DIFFERENT RELIGIONS OF THE WORLD AND they were all given the stories OF WHY THEIR RELIGION WAS so great. And finally there was a little preacher from America. Amen. And and I think his name was John Wit. And John went with there and he said, he said, "Over in my country in the Indian territory of Oklahoma, there was a woman &gt;&gt; and SHE WAS SO VILE. &gt;&gt; She was wicked above above wicked." &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; OH MY. SHE SMOKED A CIGAR. SHE WAS A PROSTITUTE and a murderer. &gt;&gt; SHE USED FOUL LANGUAGE. AMEN. She run a ch a a a STAGE COACH DOWN THROUGH THE MIDDLE OF THE TOWN AND they had to arrest her. SHE WAS SO VILE THAT WHEN THEY WENT TO WHEN THEY went to tar and feather and execute this woman that the men wouldn't even touch her with their hands because they didn't want to become polluted. She was so wicked and so vile. &gt;&gt; Oh my. And brother Wit said, "You religions of the world, I want to ask you this morning." He says, "Do you have anything in your religion that could clean the hands of Lady Mcabe?" Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; OH, HALLELUJAH. THEY SAT THERE IN SILENCE. THEY SAT THERE, COULD NOT SAY ANYTHING. AMEN. THE LITTLE FELL, HE WENT RUNNING OUT THERE. HE KICKED HIS HEELS TOGETHER. HE SAID, "I'M HERE TO TELL YOU, HALLELUJAH. I'M HERE TO TELL YOU, AMEN, THAT THE BLOOD OF JESUS WON'T JUST CLEANSE OUR HANDS, BUT IT'LL CLEANSE OUR HEARTS." AMEN. I'M HERE TO TELL YOU, THE BLOOD OF JESUS SPEAKETH BETTER THINGS THAN THAT OF ABEL. AMEN. I like this. Got a little bit more room up here to preach. HALLELUJAH. THINK ABOUT IT. THAT THE BLOOD OF JESUS WILL CLEANSE YOUR HEART. IT'LL CLEANSE YOUR MIND. AMEN. THE BIBLE SAYS THAT IT WILL TAKE AWAY YOUR GUILTY, STONY HEART AND GIVE YOU A HEART OF FLESH. &gt;&gt; OH, I say praise the Lord this morning. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Oh my. &gt;&gt; Sure. THE BLOOD SPEAKS. IT SPEAKS BETTER THINGS. AMEN. THE OLD TESTAMENT, ARE YOU WITH me this morning? &gt;&gt; The Old Testament, the blood of bulls and goats, it spoke of your guilt. &gt;&gt; All right. &gt;&gt; The New Testament speaks of your redemption. &gt;&gt; The Old Testament speaks OF DEATH AND SORROW. THE New Testament speaks of resurrection and life. The New Testament speaks of healing. It speaks of joy. IT SPEAKS OF POWER. IT SPEAKS OF LIFE. IT SPEAKS OF HEAVEN AND THE SAME BLOOD THAT WAS SHED UPON THE GROUND CALLED AFTER HIS BROTHER THAT HAD KILLED HIM. BUT THE BLOOD OF JESUS COVERS OUR SINS AND SPEAKS PEACE AND RESURRECTION AND POWER and life and healing. &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; ALL THE REDEMPTIVE blessings that the blood was shed for speaks for us this morning. &gt;&gt; Oh, the blood speaks. Amen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; In Acts chapter 16, I want to tell you here was Paul. And Paul had in his heart. He knew there was a certain mission that that he was supposed to go on. I think he was on his way to Greece, maybe. But he was on his way. And him and his brother Silas, they were on their way. And all of a sudden, God speaks to Paul's heart and says, "Don't go that way, &gt;&gt; but I need you to go to Macedonia." And so Paul changes course and the theologians and different ones call it the Macedonian call. So he got this call from God, the leadership of the Lord, &gt;&gt; first church age messenger. Evidently, every word he spoke was thus sayeth the Lord. &gt;&gt; Just saying. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; But did you read the rest of the story? &gt;&gt; He goes to Macedonia on this call. He said, "I have much seed for you. I got all this program for you to do over there. I got I mean, you're going to go over there. There's going to be many converts. There's going to be I mean, there's going to be healing and deliverance and you're going to baptize them and YOU'RE GOING TO DO ALL THESE THINGS. That's what he had in his mind. Preach. &gt;&gt; HE GOES OVER THERE AND GO STRAIGHT TO JAIL. &gt;&gt; That's it. &gt;&gt; OH, WE'D BE SITTING THERE. He didn't hear from God. I TELL YOU RIGHT NOW, HE DIDN'T HEAR FROM GOD. &gt;&gt; ANY MAN THAT WOULD HEAR FROM GOD, THERE AIN'T NO POSSIBLE WAY THAT HE WOULD GO TO JAIL. OH, COME ON. HE MISSED IT. HE MISSED IT, BROTHER JACK. &gt;&gt; WONDERFUL. &gt;&gt; HUH? But we find out that he was in jail. He didn't lose a victory &gt;&gt; WHEN THINGS WENT BAD. WHAT BROTHER BAM TELLS IN CHURCH AGE BOOK HE SAID HE SAID CLEAR SKIES AND PROSPERITY AND ALL THESE THINGS DO NOT MEAN THAT YOU'RE IN THE WILL OF GOD. NEITHER DOES CLOUDS AND STORMS AMEN SAY THAT uh that that you that you're NOT IN THE WILL OF GOD. &gt;&gt; Oh my. BUT IT'S IT'S THE ATTITUDE THAT YOU CAN KEEP AMIDST THE TRIALS OF THIS LIFE. AND SO HERE WAS A MAN THAT THAT THE BLOOD HAD SPOKEN TO HIS SOUL. HE WAS A DIFFERENT MAN THAN HE WHAT HE HAD BEEN. IT DIDN'T MATTER IF IT COME HELL OR HIGH WATER. AMEN. HE WAS GOING TO SERVE GOD. &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. So the Bible says they COME ABOUT THE MIDNIGHT HOUR AND THEY WERE THERE IN THEIR CHAINS AND THEIR STALKS. HALLELUJAH. AND THEY BEGAN TO SING. &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. WHEN THEY BEGIN TO SING AND PRAISE AND GLORIFY GOD IN THE MIDST OF HARD TRIAL, &gt;&gt; JESUS, &gt;&gt; there come a mighty earthquake. &gt;&gt; It shook down the whole jail, loosed all the prisoners. They were all going to run for their lives. Paul just told them all to stand still. The the centurion that was there, the Roman jailer or the Macedonian jailer, he realized THAT IT WAS A DEATH SENTENCE IF HE LOST HIS PRISONERS. &gt;&gt; He was going to fall on his sword and stab himself to death. Paul said, "Don't hurt yourself, son. &gt;&gt; We're all here." &gt;&gt; Oh my. He said, "If you believe on the Lord Jesus Christ, thou and thy house shall be saved." Oh my, it's got to be a household. Brother Brandham said, "What made so many LITTLE KIDS, WHAT MAKES so many women out on the streets?" HE SAID, "WHAT MAKES SO MUCH JUVENILE DELINQUENCY? BECAUSE WE'RE NOT ABLE TO GET OUR HOUSEHOLD UNDER THE BLOOD." OH MY FRIENDS, I BELIEVE EVERY DADDY AND EVERY MOMMY, AMEN, HAS GOT A GOD-GIVEN RESPONSIBILITY TO GET THEIR CHILDREN UNDER THE BLOOD. THEY'VE GOT TO SPEAK A DIFFERENT KIND OF LANGUAGE. THEY GOT TO SPEAK THE BLOOD OF CHRIST TO THEIR CHILDREN. &gt;&gt; Praise God. &gt;&gt; Mama, you got to speak it to your children or it won't be too long. They won't be under the blood no more. They'll go by the way of their daddy's blood. &gt;&gt; They can't help it because they're born mortals. &gt;&gt; They've got to be reborn. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; You can apply the token to your house and to your children &gt;&gt; and that's that's we should do that. &gt;&gt; Amen. But those children have got to come under the power of that broken blood cell that when that cell broke there on Calvary, it loosed the dunamis power of almighty God. And the only thing that'll bring new birth in your life is when that power of that broken blood cell comes back upon the believer. Prophet goes on to say, "The blood speaks to your household." Listen, listen, listen to this from the church age book. Brother Ram said, "The evidence of the Holy Ghost is to receive the revealed word of God for your age." &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; So now then, the blood speaks, but remember, it's a bleeding word. Hallelujah. Amen. &gt;&gt; Brother Bram says, "Think." I'm announcing that this morning. Think. Think just for a moment. Don't let it just just be words that some red-faced preacher, Amen, is saying this morning. But let it be the word of God that broods over your spirit that changes you from what you once were to what you should be. &gt;&gt; Brother Brand makes a statement. He says, "Think your garments washed by the water of the bleeding word." So remember that the there there's a there's a word that's come forth, but every word in every age has a blood connected to it. &gt;&gt; In the days of Irene, there was a blood connected to the message of Irene. The same with uh Martin and Columba, Luther, Wesley. Each age had a BLOOD CONNECTED to the word. You say, "Where do you get that, brother D?" Well, John preached it back in first John, I believe it was. HE SAID, "WE WALK IN THE LIGHT as he is in the light AND WE HAVE FELLOWSHIP ONE WITH ANOTHER AND &gt;&gt; the blood of Jesus cleanses us from all sins." &gt;&gt; So, AS LONG AS WE'RE WALKING IN REVEALED LIGHT, AS LONG AS WE'RE WALKING IN THE LIGHT OF THE WORD, THERE'S A blood &gt;&gt; and it's a bleeding word. And brother B SAYS THAT THE WORD BECAME BLOOD. &gt;&gt; HOW DID THAT HAPPEN? BECAUSE THE WORD WAS MADE FLESH AND BLOOD IN THE BODY OF CHRIST. HE WAS THE WORD EXPRESSED AND THAT WORD THEN BLED FOR YOU. &gt;&gt; AND YOU ARE WASHED IN BLEEDING WORD. &gt;&gt; The word bleeding the life of God in the word. And the word was bled for you that you might be washed from the filth of these prostitutes. speaking of denominations and and and worldly living and these kind of things. He says, "And be cleansed and sanctified by the washing of the water of the word." &gt;&gt; He said, "And it makes your mind and your heart stayed on God in his word." It's invisible union if you were wondering. So now the Bible tells us in St. John's gospel chapter 6 verse 53. This is a profound scripture because it says, "Then Jesus said unto them, verily, verily, I say unto you, except you eat the flesh of the son of man and drink his blood, you have no life in you." All right? So the the world of that day, brother B says the intelligent people of that day said he wants us to be a cannibal &gt;&gt; or he wants us to be a vampire. But they could not understand that what Jesus was saying to them that YOU MUST RECEIVE ME IN MY ENTIRETY THAT ALL THAT I AM, MY FLESH, MY NATURE, MY LIFE, MY BEING &gt;&gt; AND IF YOU RECEIVE ME THEN YOU RECEIVE the one that sent me. So he says this and SO THEN FROM THAT YOU HAVE EVERY KIND OF DENOMINATIONAL doctrine all the way down to uh transsubstantiation and all these other kind of things you know that the Catholic Church teaches that the communion it becomes the literal blood and the literal uh uh flesh of God and the priest can give that to you and somehow you've had a mass you've had a deception is what you've had. you've had, you know, uh uh uh ignorance gone to seed is what that is. And but a prophet comes in our day, a vindicated prophet, and he tells us that this statement was made, this profound statement in John's gospel, brother Brandham tells us that it was made solely to thin down the crowd &gt;&gt; BECAUSE THEY COULDN'T EXPLAIN IT. THEY COULDN'T UNDERSTAND IT. THE DISCIPLES couldn't understand it. All right. SO NOW THE BLOOD WAS SPEAKING Christ the word the bleeding word speaking &gt;&gt; TO THIN DOWN THE CROWD TO SEPARATE the believers from the unbelievers &gt;&gt; to separate the the the makeelievers from the true believers from GREATER THAN SOLOMON. BROTHER BAM SAYS AND HE NEVER EXPLAINED IT. RIGHT? &gt;&gt; HE DIDN'T HAVE TO explain it. Watch what he says. Now, this is, you know, this is a pretty tough statement that he makes. HE HAD TO SHAKE OFF THE PARASITES that were around him. &gt;&gt; INSTEAD OF TRYING TO baby and put their name on a book, he was shaking them away. &gt;&gt; He had no use for them. &gt;&gt; WOW. OH MY. SOMETIMES YOU YOU READ THINGS IN THE MESSAGE, YOU SEE things in the word, IT SEEMS LIKE IT'S STRIKING. YOU FIND WHERE A PROPHET LOOKS AT THE the the women of that day. He said, "I've I've told you that that cutting your hair made you a a a dishonorable woman. &gt;&gt; Painting your face &gt;&gt; makes you a Jezebel." &gt;&gt; HE SAID, "WE COULD CALL YOU MISS DOG MEAT. OH, SO MANY WOMEN, THEY BACKED UP ON THAT. &gt;&gt; HE SAID, "YOU CUT YOUR HAIR, YOU'RE A NAKED PROSTITUTE before God." &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; HE SAID, "YOU WEAR THOSE LITTLE UH LUSTFUL CLOTHES." HE SAID, "YOU'LL BE JUDGED WITH the with the prostitutes in that day, even though you've been virtuous to your husband." &gt;&gt; That's right. HE SAID, "YOU BOYS WITH YOUR BANGS HANGING DOWN IN YOUR FACE &gt;&gt; and and and and and and this and these curlers and all these things in your hair," he said, "YOU HAVE A SODOMITE SPIRIT." &gt;&gt; OH MY, THINK ABOUT IT. AND AND HERE THEY ARE WITH THEIR LITTLE LIPS POKED OUT AND LITTLE FUZZY CAULIFLOWER LOOKING HAIRCUT AND AND ALL THESE KIND OF, YOU KNOW, LITTLE BOYS RUNNING AROUND WITH JEWELRY ON AND NECKLACES AND RINGS ON THEIR FINGERS. AND I SAY, "YOU'RE JUST A" AND THEY SPEND MORE TIME AT THE BEAUTY SHOP. OH MY, THINK ABOUT THAT. AMEN. THEY'LL SPEND MORE MONEY, AMEN, ON GETTING THEIR MANICURES AND THEIR CURES AND WHATEVER THEY ARE. AMEN. WHAT IS IT? OH, I'M HERE TO TELL YOU FRIENDS, A A BOY DON'T GO GET A HAIRSTYLE. AMEN. HE GOES AND GETS A HAIRCUT. HALLELUJAH. THAT'S WHAT A BOY DOES. THAT'S WHAT A MAN DOES. AMEN. OH, LET me tell you, IT'S IT'S HARD SAYINGS. IT'S HOLINESS TO THE EXTREMES. BUT BROTHER SAID, THAT'S WHAT WE BELIEVE. &gt;&gt; I say, "Oh, God. &gt;&gt; My God." and and and and and so it's hard sayings. &gt;&gt; AND BROTHER BAM DIDN'T HAVE TO EXPLAIN IT. &gt;&gt; HE JUST SAID IT. &gt;&gt; WHAT WAS IT FOR? TO SHAKE OFF THE PARASITES. &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; He said, "PARASITES, OH YEAH, PARASITES ARE THE ONES THAT JUST STICK TO THE CHURCH AND SUCK THE LIFE OUT OF THE CHURCH BUT NEVER CONTRIBUTE ANYTHING BACK TO IT." &gt;&gt; I.E. a dog tick, in case you were wondering. DEER TICKS AND DOG TICKS AND AND EVERY KIND OF uh blood sucking leeches and ALL THESE KIND OF THINGS. WHAT DID THEY DO? THEY COME TO CHURCH, THEY DRAW ON THE PASTOR. THEY PASTOR, PASTOR, PASTOR, ALWAYS PULLING ON THE PASTOR. NEVER HAVE NOTHING TO CONTRIBUTE TO THE CHURCH. &gt;&gt; BUT THE BLOOD OF JESUS SPEAKETH BETTER THINGS THAN THESE. &gt;&gt; OH, glory to God. He was shaking them away. &gt;&gt; That's right. That's why we preach these things shakes you loose &gt;&gt; makes you think. &gt;&gt; If we don't tell you where your sin is, then how you going to repent? &gt;&gt; How you going to repent of anything? You you just Brother B said he just babies them and pats them and and the and the and and the and the what do you call them? Uh the kind old priest &gt;&gt; pet you this way all the time. You don't never rub that kitty backwards though. Oh man, she'll bite you. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Amen. The disciples couldn't explain it. &gt;&gt; Eating his body and drinking his blood. Now listen what he says about those disciples. They had done died to those things. They realized we we're not here to try to, you know, reason with God or teach God anything or teach. No, we're not here. we we're dead to those things. They had died to those principles. They weren't here to try to get on board with the Pharisees and the Sadducees and try to, you know, uh uh trap him in his own words. No, they just they just stayed quiet. He said no matter what it is, how much defeat looked like they had, they still believed it anyhow. They could see in that man a man THAT ATE, DRANK, FISHED, SLEPT, EVERYTHING ELSE, was born HERE ON THE EARTH, WALKED WITH THEM, talked with them, WORE CLOTHES LIKE the rest of them. But he was God. &gt;&gt; All right. &gt;&gt; All right. AMEN. &gt;&gt; HE SAID, "WHO DO MEN SAY THAT I AM? THEY say they're this and they're saying they're that you're of that." He said, "But who do you say that I am?" &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; He said, "Thou art the Christ, the son of the living God." Amen. &gt;&gt; Jesus said, "You eat my flesh and drink my blood." The Bible says, "And they said, these are hard sayings. Who can hear it? &gt;&gt; Who can hear it?" But then Jesus asked him, he saw the se Jesus saw the the multitude go away. He saw the 70 GO AWAY. HE SAW ALL THESE OTHER THINGS. He said he he told the disciples, he said, "Are you going to go away, too?" &gt;&gt; Exactly right. &gt;&gt; Peter said, "Where could we go?" &gt;&gt; Oh my. Where could we go where we are sure that thou has a word of life? &gt;&gt; Amen. And they saw it clearly vindicated. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Now, we notice that no matter what others did, how they walked away, those disciples uh just this quote is just profound to me. Those disciples were predestinated. They were ordained to eternal life. They couldn't explain it. They couldn't explain it no more than the rest of them could. But there was something in them. Are you with me? There was something in them. &gt;&gt; It was that representation in heaven. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Oh, just like Abel when he looked back and saw the lamb slain and knew that he was identified with that. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. So, he had to replicate what he SAW IN HEAVEN ON THE EARTH. Praise God. &gt;&gt; Oh my. Oh my. &gt;&gt; Brother Bam goes on to say it was a thought that God had of them before the foundation of the world. So when Peter and the rest of the disciples minus Judas that WHEN THEY SAID, "THOU HAS THE WORDS OF ETERNAL LIFE. WHERE ELSE CAN WE GO?" BROTHER BEAM SAID IT WAS A REPRESENTATION THAT THEY HAD OF A THOUGHT THAT GOD HAD OF THEM BEFORE THE FOUNDATION OF THE WORLD. They knew that IT HAD MANIFESTED ITSELF HERE. That thought that you that that God had of you when you look at this word and you look at the message and you look at the blood of Christ and you say, "It's for me. It's not WHETHER IT'S FOR ANYBODY ELSE. I DON'T KNOW. BUT I KNOW IT'S FOR ME. IT WAS JUST FOR ME. HE DIED ON CALVARY JUST FOR ME. IF I'M THE ONLY PERSON IN ALL OF THE UH THE PALM COAST THAT CAN BELIEVE THE WORD OF GOD, IT WAS JUST FOR ME &gt;&gt; BECAUSE HE HAD A THOUGHT ABOUT ME BEFORE THE FOUNDATION of the world. &gt;&gt; And I'm connected with God because of it. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; And was sure that God's promise vindicated and nothing is going to change that for them. Brother B said, "That's real, genuine Christianity." And he makes this statement that uh boy, if you're in Armenian this morning, you're going to be really upset. Hopefully, we're all Calvinists. I don't I don't want to be, you know, you start throwing things at me. the prophet of God. Uh hey, this was uh what's today? The 25th. &gt;&gt; Yeah. This is uh 1965 uh February 20th. &gt;&gt; God's chosen place of worship. Brother Van makes a statement. He says, "But by grace you are saved by the grace of God through predestination of God's fornowledge of your being." &gt;&gt; So you thought you just got saved in an altar. &gt;&gt; That's when you recognized that you've always been a child of God. &gt;&gt; Oh, hallelujah. You were predestinated. Amen. By fornowledge to be saved by grace. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Beautiful. So, brother M tells us is then your salvation tonight uh as our musicians come. I won't keep you very much longer. This may take a little while, but I want you to be in place when I when I get there. So then, brother M tells us, then my salvation and yours tonight does not hinge upon the merits of our own acts. It hinges upon the positive sovereign grace of almighty God. &gt;&gt; Who has chosen us in him? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; That's the Bible. The Bible say that that we were chosen in him &gt;&gt; from the foundation of the world. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. So uh certainly he says I could never be perfect &gt;&gt; right &gt;&gt; nor you could never be perfect. So that that that that that includes all of us. And we don't claim to be perfect, but we have this one consolation that our faith rests in a perfect sacrifice &gt;&gt; that has already been received. So when we begin to consider that in the in the in the days of the of the of the Levitical law and the the time when you know man brother said oh if we could just offer a lamb it would be so easy. He said it's easier now. &gt;&gt; All right. &gt;&gt; It's easier now. &gt;&gt; You just have to believe. &gt;&gt; All right. Amen. And so but in that day they they they they would on the for on the 10th day of the month the worshipper would come he would have inspected his own lamb first. He would have done the very best that he could. He would have he would have made sure that that lamb was healthy. He would have made sure that all of its you know features and functions and everything was acceptable best to his knowledge. &gt;&gt; And then he would take that lamb and he would offer that lamb. He would take it to the priest. Now, the priest would take it on the 10th day and he would keep that lamb up until the 14th day. AND DURING THAT TIME, HE WOULD INSPECT THAT LAMB. HE would look at it. He would look through its its wool. HE WOULD CHECK ITS EYES, MAKE SURE IT WASN'T BLIND, make sure that when he fed it that it he would ingest, digest, manifest. He would HE WOULD HAVE ALL THE uh his features would all be working. He wouldn't be lame. He wouldn't be limping. HE WOULD INSPECT THAT LAMB, scrutinize for four days. &gt;&gt; At the end of four days, he would take that lamb and he would take it to the altar and there he would slay the lamb and the lamb would bleed for the worshipper. But I want to call something to your ATTENTION THAT DURING THIS TIME OF INSPECTION AND THIS TIME OF SCRUTINIZATION, DURING THIS TIME OF EXAMINATION AND AND PURIFICATION AND ALL THESE THINGS, AT NO time did he ever consider the worshipper. &gt;&gt; He only considered the lamb. &gt;&gt; I'M HERE TO TELL YOU THIS MORNING, IF GOD WAS GOING TO INSPECT US, HE WOULD FIND ALL KINDS OF FLAWS. HE WOULD FIND ALL KINDS OF DISCREPANCIES AND WEAKNESSES AND MENTAL DURESS AND NERVOUSNESS AND ANXIETY AND LUST AND EVERY KIND OF HABIT. OH, BUT LET ME TELL YOU THIS MORNING THAT THE BLOOD OF JESUS SPEAKETH BETTER THINGS THAN THAT OF ABEL AND THAT OF MOSES AND THAT OF ISAIAH. OH, BUT IT'S HERE TO TELL YOU THIS MORNING THAT HE'S SPEAKING PEACE. &gt;&gt; HE'S SPEAKING LOVE. HE'S SPEAKING MERCY BECAUSE HE ONLY considered the lamb. &gt;&gt; One lamb for all. Amen. And he WAS ENOUGH. OH MY. AN OLD song of the church says that one drop of his blood can cleanse 10,000 souls. &gt;&gt; Oh my. Brother said if we had that blood in a charger this morning, he said it wouldn't be as valuable as those that it purchased. &gt;&gt; That you're the purchase of that blood this morning. He said, ' THEN HOW DO WE KNOW that we get that? When the worshipper puts his hands BY FAITH UPON THE BODY OF THE LORD Jesus feels the these are the words of a God sent prophet. HE SAID FEELS the terror of sin. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; The mark of spit in his own face, FEELS the groanings of Gethsemane, the agonies of Calvary, and knows that he is guilty. You are guilty. I am guilty. &gt;&gt; And confesses his sins correctly. Amen. &gt;&gt; Oh, blessed Lord, I'm guilty. I have no other way but you to help me. And by faith, the Holy Spirit has come and bids me come. And I now by faith accept Jesus as my personal savior. That life that come from him on Calvary called the Holy Ghost which was hid in the blood in the blood cell of the Lord Jesus returns to the worshipper and baptizes him with the Holy Ghost into the body of Christ. I say that, my friends, is the gospel that our first messenger preached to us when Paul said, "I'm determined to know nothing among you save Christ and him crucified." &gt;&gt; That same gospel was preached by our seventh messenger. And may it be preached this morning. May you hear it from the bottoms of your heart and say, "Lord, I accept. I receive. I believe." Let's stand to our feet this morning as our pastor comes. &gt;&gt; Amen. I want to pray with you this morning as we change the order of this service, but not in any rush to get out. Just want to make the opportunity tell you a little story. our heads bowed, our hearts before the Lord in humble adoration. There was a preacher by the name of DL Moody back just prior to the during the time of the Civil War. There was a great fire in Chicago. Burned the whole city. Hundreds of people died. It's terrible time. Just prior to that fire, Dwight Moody was had a had a meeting. And in that meeting, he had preached four or five nights. He was going to continue the meeting the next week. And so that night of the last night of the meeting, he bowed the hearts of the people and he prayed for them. He dismissed them. And he said, "I want you to think upon these things for a week, and when you come back next week, we want you to make a decision for Christ." And he let the people go that night. And little did he know that many of those people would not return because the fire came and many of them died. A tragedy, loss of life, all these things. But DL Moody said, he said, "From that day forward," he said, "I knew that I could never dismiss a service without giving the people an opportunity to make a decision for Christ." With our heads bowed this morning, friends, if you've never chose to follow the Lord, I would I would implore you today to slip your hand to God and say, "I'm a sinner. Lord, be merciful to me. Let me let me correctly repent this morning and accept that supreme sacrifice that I could be part of that ransom host of God that I could be a Christian. I want to be a Christian more than I want anything in this world. I want to be a son and daughter of God. As we pray this morning, I I trust you'll pray with me. I've prayed this prayer in many nations around the world over the course of 40 plus years. I don't believe it'll ever come back to us void. Believe it's the word of God. It's not just a tradition of men. It's not just some old theology. Because I never had theology. I was raised a dirty sinner, drug addict, filthy person. But Christ came saved me from my sins. And if there's ever anything I could do to win some soul to Christ, I say, Lord, help me to win that soul to thee. I pray, Father, this morning we bow our hearts in humble adoration. Lord, that you have bid us come, come now to thee, Lord, just as I am, without one plea. But Lord, that thy blood was shed for me on that old dark cross. That day when it was a day of all days when the when God himself came down in Christ to reconcile the world to himself. I pray, Father, for these your children, Lord. Many I know are are devout Christians. They loved you for many years, and I know they love you even still today. But Lord, if we've waned in our experience, if we've allowed the world to creep in, if we've allowed the the the the the cares of life to drag us down and to to live beneath our privilege this morning, could we come as David said, and let us not forget all of his benefits. For the blood of Jesus has every redemptive promise laying in it. Lord, I accept that blood as the atonement for my sins. The only means of salvation is through the bleeding word of this day. Lord, we pray God that you'll help us each one. Lord, that you'll burn this message down deep in our souls that we could that we could walk with you every day in the light of God's word and the blood of Jesus would cleanse us from all sins. We'll thank you for it as we give you all the praise and honor and glory that all sufficient name of the Lord Jesus Christ. We pray. Amen and amen. Praise the Lord. Oh, I love him. I love him. Hallelujah. I love him. Oh, that you probably don't know that song. Uh because he first loved me. How do we How's that go? Ah, that's it. I love him. Oh, I I love him. All because God bless you, brother Jack. He first loved me and purchase and burn just my salvation. Old C tree. Come on, sing it again. I love him. I love him. Oh, I love him. I love him because he first loved me and birth just my salvation. ation on camp tree. Hallelujah. This a another little song. This I'm gonna have the drum drop out. Just says Jesus is the sweetest name I know and he's just the same as his holy name. That's the reason why I love him so. Oh, Jesus is the sweetest name I know. And I love him. Yes, I love him. He's the only one true lover of my soul. Yes, I love him. Oh, I love him. He's the only one, true lover of my soul. Come on, let's give him a hand of praise. Thank you, Jesus. Oh, through the blood. Through the blood. Oh, we can come into his presence &gt;&gt; through the blood. Jesus has Jesus has made a way. Made a way. We can come. We can come into his presence is through the blood. Through the blood. Come on, sing it one more time. Through the blood. Through. Through the blood. Oh, through the blood we can come. We can come into his presence is through the blood. Through the blood Jesus has made a way. Thank you, Jesus. We can come oh into his his presences through the blood. Come on one more time. Through the blood. Through through the blood. Yes. It's through. Hallelujah. That precious blood we can come into his presence. Yes. Through the blood Jesus made a way. Oh, we can come into his presence &gt;&gt; through the Come on and give the Lord a hand of praise. Thank God for the blood. It still speaks. It speaks greater things than the blood of uh Abel. We certainly appreciate brother Dale on this morning. Wonderful. Wonderful, wonderful thought. Amen. Given to our hearts. And I just love um how the Lord just kind of led him through. and just never really caught how uh we always talked about how Abel had a revelation and how he knew to offer um blood where his brother was offering fruit of the ground and things of that nature and and uh but Abel had this revelation because brother Brandham said he already saw Christ that that was it. He had a God had given him a vision of the lamb being slain before the foundation of the world. Abel had that revelation. Based on his revelation, he was able to offer certain sacrifice. And here here Cain just didn't have it. God never showed it to him. But he told him said, "Now if you can do the same thing that your brother's doing, then I'll receive it." And I love the way brother Dale brought that. Had Cain accepted that then he would have also had to accept the revelation of the serpent seed &gt;&gt; that would that's powerful right he would have had to understand the revelation of the serpent seat actually how he got here &gt;&gt; it would have changed everything and he didn't want he didn't want nothing to do with that &gt;&gt; so he kills his brother I tell you that was just powerful and and then all to wind it all the way up to the end and you know when We sometimes we we we we we get caught in just uh just the mistakes that we've made, the failures that we have in our own life. And and um you know, Satan's always bombarding us. You did this, you did that, you did this. God will never receive you because you did this, because you did that. And and often times if we're not if we're not careful, Amen. We always look at what we did, but we never look to see what he did. &gt;&gt; And he said when when the when in the Old Testament, they would always bring their sacrifice for their sins. They give it to the priests. And and the priest when you he takes it on the 10th day, he's holding it to the 14th day. But when he takes it on the 10th day, once you give him that, he never looks at you again. &gt;&gt; The priest never sees you anymore. He's looking at the sacrifice that you brought and all your sins are placed over over the head of this lamb. We had a lamb that was slain for our sins. Let's look at what he did, not what we did. Not what we do. Let's look at what he's already done. Amen. This This is a finished work. This is a finished work. I tell you, you ought to leave here. Amen. Excited to serve the Lord. Amen. Because there's nothing like the blood of Jesus. What can wash away? &gt;&gt; Oh, nothing but the blood. &gt;&gt; And what can make me whole? &gt;&gt; Think about it. Oh, precious. Hey, that makes me white. No other, no other found. I know nothing but the blood. Come on. Hey. Oh, precious. That makes me Oh, it makes me wait. Oh, no other fountain. I know nothing but the blood of Jesus. Hallelujah. And are you washed in the blood? Oh, in the soul cleansing blood of the lamb. And are your garments spotless? Are they white as snow? Oh, are you washed in the blood? Oh, are you washed? Hallelujah. In the blood. Think about it y'all. In the soul cleansing blood. HALLELUJAH. ARE YOUR GARMENTS? Are they spotless? Are they white as snow? And are you wash? OH. OH, PRECIOUS. OH, precious is that makes me worried as snow. No other, no other fountain. No, nothing but the blood of Jesus. Come on, one more time. Oh, precious. The flow that makes me GOD, I THANK YOU FOR your blood this morning. No other, no other fountain. No, nothing but the blood. &gt;&gt; Nothing but the blood. Nothing but nothing but the blood. &gt;&gt; Thank God for the blood. &gt;&gt; Thank God for the blood. &gt;&gt; NOTHING BUT THE BLOOD. NOTHING but the blood. One more time say nothing but the blood of Jesus. HALLELUJAH. HALLELUJAH. OH, I know it was the blood. Yes, I know it was the blood. Oh, I know it was the blood for me. Hey, one day when I was lost, Jesus died upon the cross. Oh, and I know for me, oh, it was my savior's blood. It was &gt;&gt; my blood. &gt;&gt; Yes, it was. &gt;&gt; For me, &gt;&gt; yeah. One day when I'm alone, one day &gt;&gt; Jesus died. &gt;&gt; Oh, it was my Savior's bloodior. &gt;&gt; I know it was the blood. Say, I know it was &gt;&gt; Yes, I know it was the blood. Hallelujah. I know. &gt;&gt; Oh, &gt;&gt; one day. &gt;&gt; Oh, Jesus died upon the cross. And I know it was a blood for me. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; My God. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Father, how grateful we are, Lord, for the word that has been brought to us. &gt;&gt; Your blood is still speaking. Another songwriter says, "It reaches to the highest mountain and it flows through the lowest valley. The blood that gives me strength &gt;&gt; from day to day, &gt;&gt; it will never lose its power. &gt;&gt; Father, I I I I thank you for your servant just getting himself out of the way, Lord, to to speak this to our hearts. And Lord, many of us needed to hear. I know there were so many things spoken, Father, here that that just blessed me, God. And sometimes when the enemy coming to Lord bombard our minds with with with you did this and you did that when we just get a good glimpse of the blood. &gt;&gt; Realize Lord that you're not looking at us but you're looking at the sacrifice that was paid on the cross at Calvary. Lord the perfect sacrifice that was made for us. Lord, help us, Father, to lay our hands on that and to identify ourselves with it, with that that life that was given for us, Lord. We just love you and we appreciate you and we praise you. I pray, Lord, your blessings upon Brother Dale and that you would just continue to use him for your glory, God. the next few days that he has that he'll get himself a little rest oh God before he goes back home and just ask Lord Jesus that you would bless his church and Lord all the saints that gather there father Lord and we just trust Lord Jesus that these words that have been spoken to our hearts today would be words that we'll go and meditate on and just Father allow the Holy Spirit to continue to minister to us Lord that it would just purge us from the inside Lord all the the things of this world Father that enemy might might try to bring us into, Father. Help us to separate ourselves, Lord, and walk clean, Lord. Father, in a life that is that is pleasing to thee. Always remembering, Lord, of your great sacrifice that was given for us. We never want to do anything, Father, Lord, that would bring disgrace to the blood that was shed for us. Thank you for that blood, Jesus. Thank you for your blood, God. It's in Jesus name we pray. Amen. Can we give the Lord a hand of praise? Hallelujah. The Lord bless you as Amen. You leave, you can be seated. Amen. On today, the brothers will come uh to dismiss us. Praise the Lord. We'll be back on uh Wednesday night uh for our Wednesday night service. And as I say, don't forget, please remember uh Sister Vera's family. They have the the wake on uh next Friday and then also the service for her brother on next Saturday. So, if we have any sisters that can just help uh with serving that family during their time of loss, uh we would greatly appreciate it. Amen. God richly bless you. Amen. As you go today, hallelujah. Hey. Heat. Heat.
