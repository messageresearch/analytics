[44:35] [Music]
[44:41] [Applause]
[44:45] name
[44:47] amen praise the
[44:54] Lord feel like I have one more
[44:57] one more song One More song I wrote um
[45:00] after we did
[45:02] down um we had a big uh live uh worship
[45:07] night recording that we did a few years
[45:09] back and I was I was in charge of
[45:11] organizing it and choosing the songs and
[45:13] making sure everything went smoothly and
[45:14] it was just a huge pressure something I
[45:17] had never experienced before and uh it
[45:20] was very overwhelming and the night
[45:23] before that concert I was trying to pray
[45:27] and and connect with God and just
[45:29] relieve some of that stress and I just
[45:31] couldn't there was a a wall that I was
[45:33] hitting and I was just so surrounded by
[45:37] doubt and little comments that that I'd
[45:39] heard people say indirectly and it was
[45:42] just so overwhelming and uh I just
[45:45] wanted to just let it go and talk to God
[45:47] and there was something that was
[45:49] stopping me and wouldn't let me get
[45:51] there and so I just sat down in the
[45:53] living room and was just didn't know
[45:55] what to do and I just started talking
[45:57] and and I felt like I couldn't pray but
[46:01] I just started to say something say
[46:03] words and I I found myself writing
[46:06] another
[46:07] song and uh so I just started writing
[46:11] these lyrics down and typing them in my
[46:12] phone and I just sat there and once I
[46:15] felt like I expressed what I wanted to
[46:16] say to God I just started reading
[46:19] through it and reading through it and it
[46:21] just I I felt his presence just come in
[46:23] the room and he just felt like he just
[46:26] gave me a big hug and said I got
[46:29] you and
[46:33] I and that it wasn't it wasn't good
[46:36] enough I was like no like you really got
[46:38] me like I I'm not okay tomorrow like I I
[46:41] can't do this on my own like I need to
[46:43] know that you you really got me and he
[46:45] just gave me the biggest spiritual hug
[46:47] in my living room and uh so this song
[46:50] that's the testimony behind this song it
[46:52] doesn't sound like a a very happy song
[46:54] but the testimony behind behind it is is
[46:57] very very uh helpful and very exciting
[47:01] for me

[59:08] all right just leave it right there nope
[59:10] go back go back okay thank you very
[59:14] much
[59:16] um here in Ephesians 5 the Bible
[59:21] says uh wives verse 22 wives submit
[59:27] yourselves unto your own husbands as
[59:29] unto the Lord for the husband is the
[59:33] head of the wife even as Christ is the
[59:35] head of the church and he is the savior
[59:38] of the body therefore as the church is
[59:41] subject unto Christ so let the wives be
[59:44] to their own husbands in everything
[59:48] let's have a word of prayer uh father we
[59:51] have read the word of the Lord and God
[59:54] God we uh know that you have purpose for
[59:58] placing these uh things in scripture and
[1:00:02] as the Holy Spirit would just take us
[1:00:03] now Lord into uh this thought that you
[1:00:07] have as we're dealing with the families
[1:00:09] we realize there is a major attack on
[1:00:13] families uh it's a structure that you
[1:00:15] established way back in Genesis when uh
[1:00:18] Adam was uh there in the garden you say
[1:00:20] it's not good for man to be alone and
[1:00:24] Lord you provideed a wife for him but
[1:00:26] God it wasn't just amen uh so he could
[1:00:30] just have a wife and and today people
[1:00:33] have wives just because it's eye candy
[1:00:35] but God you gave him a wife because
[1:00:37] there was a Commandment that they were
[1:00:39] supposed to be fruitful and to multiply
[1:00:41] so you knew that there would be children
[1:00:43] that would come forth on the earth and
[1:00:46] uh God you established certain things
[1:00:47] for the family our focus our H agenda
[1:00:52] our attempt today Lord is to help us get
[1:00:54] our mind Minds amen around your thoughts
[1:00:57] concerning family and God if we can wrap
[1:01:00] our minds around that then Lord uh
[1:01:02] things will just go a lot more smooth uh
[1:01:05] smoother in our in our home so we ask
[1:01:07] that you would just come Lord uh speak
[1:01:09] to us thank you for everything that has
[1:01:11] happened thus far the song service amen
[1:01:13] the specials that went forth we we thank
[1:01:16] you for each and every one uh being here
[1:01:18] and being present we ask God that you
[1:01:20] would speak to every heart not just

[1:01:24] Jesus name we pray amen and amen God

[1:01:52] picture I just like that because this
[1:01:54] just kind of gives us a little picture
[1:01:56] of what God has in mind for the
[1:01:59] family Christ is the head of the family
[1:02:05] amen Jesus Christ is the head of every
[1:02:09] family uh my brother if you're looking
[1:02:12] for a wife and she's not submitted to
[1:02:15] Christ you don't want to marry
[1:02:17] her my sister if you're praying that God
[1:02:22] would send you a husband you want to
[1:02:23] make sure that that man is has a life
[1:02:27] that is submitted to Christ because if
[1:02:29] it's not submitted to Christ you don't
[1:02:31] want to marry that man uh this would be
[1:02:35] trouble all the days of your life hello
[1:02:38] somebody you want you want a person that
[1:02:41] has amen the ability to submit
[1:02:44] themselves to their headship of Christ
[1:02:47] and when I say the headship of Christ
[1:02:49] let me just make it a little bit more
[1:02:51] clear amen this
[1:02:55] is Christ am that's right the headship
[1:02:59] of the word amen is submitting to Christ
[1:03:03] yes sir hello
[1:03:04] somebody amen and and there are
[1:03:06] sometimes things that will come up in
[1:03:08] Scripture that you may not necessarily
[1:03:11] See Clearly but you still have to learn
[1:03:14] to submit to it you say Amen even when
[1:03:17] you don't
[1:03:18] understand God I don't see it just yet
[1:03:21] but I say Amen to it and I know you'll
[1:03:23] show me and do time all right but the
[1:03:26] husband as well as the wife needs to be
[1:03:28] submitted to Christ and notice now we
[1:03:30] have the Christ Christ first and God
[1:03:32] puts the husband amen next underneath
[1:03:35] that umbrella and he has to cover the
[1:03:36] family he has to cover his wife and his
[1:03:38] children amen and and he's the protector
[1:03:41] he's to lead the family he's to provide
[1:03:43] for the family and then you know the
[1:03:45] wife kind of comes in and you know now
[1:03:47] this is this is when we when we look at
[1:03:49] this this is really uh the structure
[1:03:51] that God set up now we realize we live
[1:03:53] in a world where this structure has
[1:03:55] really been uh
[1:03:57] distorted sir hello somebody amen and
[1:04:01] because of this because of the
[1:04:03] Distortion of the structure amen if I
[1:04:06] had another uh picture diagram amen they
[1:04:09] would move the wife right up right next
[1:04:10] to the
[1:04:13] husband and some must done done that
[1:04:16] already but that ain't what God
[1:04:19] established hello somebody that's not
[1:04:21] what God EST that's what that's what
[1:04:24] Society has established but it's not
[1:04:26] what God established now we're going to
[1:04:28] go back to the scripture to see what God
[1:04:31] established but the way God put it is
[1:04:33] that the husband would be protector
[1:04:35] leader provider and then the wife would
[1:04:38] come in and she's to comfort she's to
[1:04:40] teach she's to nurture brother brandom
[1:04:42] even said that the Fifth
[1:04:45] Gospel The Fifth Gospel was coming from
[1:04:48] the wife but she had she she would have
[1:04:50] the ability to to raise her kids and to
[1:04:52] teach her kids and I mean you go back to
[1:04:54] the Garden of Eden when when when the
[1:04:56] punishments were dished out it was Adam
[1:04:59] that had to go out and work it wasn't
[1:05:00] Eve's job to do that right that's right
[1:05:02] brother that was Adam's job to go out
[1:05:04] and work now I realize we live in a
[1:05:06] society we live in a world where they're
[1:05:08] forcing the women to have to go out to
[1:05:09] work I realize that but that does not
[1:05:12] change the structure that God has in
[1:05:15] place all right all right all right but
[1:05:18] the wife amen she Comfort she teaches
[1:05:20] she Nur nourishes and then the children
[1:05:23] underneath all that umbrella now we have
[1:05:25] children today trying to go from here to
[1:05:29] up here they want to tell the parents
[1:05:32] what to
[1:05:33] do but I I I'm going tell you like this

[1:06:02] underneath the umbrella long as you
[1:06:04] underneath the house then you just love
[1:06:08] and obey your parents am
[1:06:12] amen a statement that I want to make
[1:06:14] from the prophet here because we're
[1:06:16] talking about why submitting to their
[1:06:18] husbands brother Brandon makes a
[1:06:19] statement says I was preaching the other
[1:06:21] night somewhere about women to obey
[1:06:23] their husband uhhuh he says obey and
[1:06:28] that's you know people like obey they
[1:06:30] see let me just tell you this right now
[1:06:32] and I I said it before I'm going say it
[1:06:33] again if I'm marrying a couple and they
[1:06:36] want to do their own vows I have no
[1:06:39] problem with that there's only one other
[1:06:41] thing I'm going to add I'm going to also
[1:06:43] do my vows as a preacher the vows that I
[1:06:47] do are write out a little book that I
[1:06:49] always read and in that book it says
[1:06:50] love honor and obey yes right and I'm

[1:07:04] things that's try to sound cute amen
[1:07:06] marriage means something yes it does
[1:07:09] Amen right and he he says about women
[1:07:11] obey their husband obey yeah that that
[1:07:14] that went out of the marriage ritual a
[1:07:15] long time ago but they ain't going to do
[1:07:18] that no sir they live in America and
[1:07:21] they let you know so right they're not
[1:07:24] going to obey but as long as you don't
[1:07:27] do it now he's talking to the sisters
[1:07:28] with that Spirit but as long as you
[1:07:30] don't do it don't never try to call
[1:07:32] yourself a
[1:07:35] Christian because you're not I don't
[1:07:38] care how much you dance and speak with
[1:07:41] tongues if you don't obey your husband
[1:07:43] you're out of the will of
[1:07:49] God
[1:07:51] Amen if you don't obey your husb husband
[1:07:55] you are out of the will of God your
[1:07:58] young sisters before you get married
[1:08:00] just make sure it's a young man that you
[1:08:02] can
[1:08:03] obey hello make sure you can obey him
[1:08:07] don't don't ever think that you get into
[1:08:08] the relationship so you can run
[1:08:11] things cuz you find yourself out of the
[1:08:13] will of God things don't work that way
[1:08:15] you got to be able to obey your husband
[1:08:19] all right
[1:08:21] next brother random makes this quoted
[1:08:24] marriage and divorce he says now we see
[1:08:27] being that the continuity is broken then
[1:08:30] the lifeline was broken also the
[1:08:32] timeline was broken the Covenant was
[1:08:35] broken everything shattered what caused
[1:08:38] it we're going back to the original what
[1:08:40] cus it a woman that's what broke the
[1:08:43] Covenant now if you want to read that
[1:08:44] you can read it in Genesis 3 it says now
[1:08:47] it was then it was then man was made to
[1:08:51] rule over the woman by God's word
[1:08:55] Genesis 3 we're going to read it it was
[1:08:57] then man was made to rule over the woman
[1:09:00] by God's word she was no more co-equal
[1:09:04] with him because of what happened in the
[1:09:08] Garden of Eden the wife is no more
[1:09:10] coequal with her husband and if we don't
[1:09:13] understand what happened in the garden
[1:09:14] we go back to Genesis uh chapter 2 and
[1:09:16] chapter 3 amen it was Eve that was
[1:09:19] deceived by the serpent we're going to
[1:09:22] read it it was and because of that
[1:09:24] deception uh there God has established a
[1:09:27] certain order a certain place amen for
[1:09:29] the husband and for the wife praise the
[1:09:33] Lord we're doing things based on what
[1:09:35] happened in Genesis glory to God not by
[1:09:37] what's happening in the world but by
[1:09:39] what happened in Genesis amen church we
[1:09:43] we want to go back to that original amen
[1:09:46] marriage that's that's what we're
[1:09:47] striving for that's what we're looking
[1:09:49] for all right so so he says she was no
[1:09:51] more co-equal with him she was co-equal
[1:09:55] in nature you know but when she broke
[1:09:57] God's word God made a man to be a ruler
[1:09:59] over her Genesis 3:16 if you want to put
[1:10:02] it down she was no more equal with the
[1:10:05] man she was a breaker of God's word
[1:10:08] don't you see see the church down here
[1:10:10] the breaker of God's word that throwed
[1:10:13] her completely out of continuity and
[1:10:15] that's what the church has done it's
[1:10:16] throw uh throw spiritual death upon the
[1:10:19] whole thing now you understand why I
[1:10:21] hammer at these things like I do it's
[1:10:23] truth it this is Bible facts notice why
[1:10:28] did she do such a thing as this how
[1:10:30] could that lovely beautiful perfect
[1:10:32] woman I seen a picture one time I
[1:10:34] believe was in Greece of an artist that
[1:10:36] painted a picture of Eve she was the
[1:10:38] most horrible looking thing you ever
[1:10:40] seen that shows what a carnal mind can
[1:10:42] look at but she wasn't she was beautiful
[1:10:45] because she was a perfect she was
[1:10:47] perfect woman all woman I I like that
[1:10:51] Eve was all
[1:10:54] woman yes
[1:10:56] sir we got a lot of EES
[1:11:00] today that think they man right but when
[1:11:04] God made Eve she was all woman other
[1:11:07] thing we know about what God did when he
[1:11:08] when he made Adam and Eve they were he
[1:11:10] was both male he was masculine and
[1:11:12] feminine at the same time but God had to
[1:11:14] take the feminine Spirit out of Adam and
[1:11:17] he gave that to Eve praise the Lord so
[1:11:21] when a man turns around and has a
[1:11:22] feminine spirit in him you know
[1:11:23] something wrong somewhere let me put it
[1:11:26] this way that did not come from God yes
[1:11:28] sir no sir Hallelujah now now I want I
[1:11:31] want I'm going say this you know just
[1:11:33] the same way that they're trying to
[1:11:35] force us to accept the homosexual gender
[1:11:38] there's a spirit in the land that's also
[1:11:40] trying to force the sisters to get away
[1:11:42] from the image that God had for them in
[1:11:45] Genesis
[1:11:47] true we we are battling Spirits every
[1:11:51] day you go to work you battling a spirit
[1:11:53] amen amen amen every day you go to work
[1:11:56] you battle a spirit you got to realize
[1:11:58] it's a spirit yes sir all right let's go
[1:12:00] on amen amen it ain't got quiet yet but
[1:12:03] I guess it will be soon let's keep going
[1:12:06] amen he says uh an artist that painted a
[1:12:08] picture of Eve she was most uh most
[1:12:10] horrible looking thing you ever seen
[1:12:12] that shows what a carnal man can look at
[1:12:13] but if she wasn't she was a beautiful
[1:12:16] because she was perfect woman all woman
[1:12:18] notice why did she do such a thing being
[1:12:21] in that high order she was right with
[1:12:25] man co-equal with him but we all know
[1:12:28] that she lost her
[1:12:30] co-equal with man when she sinned and
[1:12:34] God said man would be your ruler from
[1:12:36] here on out now that's the scripture if
[1:12:39] you want to we could read it and uh
[1:12:41] since since he said if you want to we
[1:12:43] can read it we going to read
[1:12:46] it we not preaching things outside the
[1:12:49] Bible that's right this is the scripture
[1:12:52] and you know so so what we want to do is
[1:12:54] align ourselves up with scripture now
[1:12:56] here in Genesis 3 verse we're going to
[1:12:58] go verse 1-6 but we're going to take it
[1:13:01] slow says now the serpent this is what
[1:13:03] happened in the Garden of Eden this is
[1:13:05] what created the problem where amen a
[1:13:07] woman is no longer co-equal not not not
[1:13:10] like that anymore the husband has been
[1:13:12] made the ruler of the home amen not just
[1:13:15] in the house but even in the
[1:13:17] church this this why you see that
[1:13:20] according to the scripture uh you're not
[1:13:22] supposed to have woman preach
[1:13:24] I know that is not uh
[1:13:28] popular but we here let me just put it
[1:13:31] this way we're not trying to be popular
[1:13:35] we're trying to be
[1:13:38] scriptural I mean and churches all over
[1:13:41] the place got it and then they they
[1:13:42] justify but I can't see it according to
[1:13:45] the word of God the Bible say I Ser not
[1:13:48] a woman to teach or usur authority over
[1:13:50] a man and and and when a woman takes
[1:13:52] this pull she has she has control over
[1:13:55] the entire congregation sir amen it's
[1:13:59] spirits in the
[1:14:01] land it's it's if I can just put it this
[1:14:04] way it's it's spiritual
[1:14:06] homosexuality and spiritual
[1:14:10] lesbianism now the Bible plainly say let
[1:14:13] the bishop be husband of one
[1:14:16] wife that that that's the Bible H H how
[1:14:19] how we going to go over the Bible and
[1:14:22] now you got women want to be called
[1:14:24] Bishops that is that is spiritual
[1:14:28] lesbianism that's right amen
[1:14:32] amen amen that's what it
[1:14:35] is see and and we don't need that in the
[1:14:38] church it's it's sad enough we got to
[1:14:40] deal with it in the world but we don't
[1:14:42] need that these are spirits that are
[1:14:43] coming to the land and we fight daily
[1:14:46] right we fight daily Amen on the Bible
[1:14:49] says not a serle was more subtle than
[1:14:51] any beast of the field
[1:14:53] which the Lord God had made and he said
[1:14:56] unto the woman now notice the serpent
[1:14:58] wasn't talking to Adam here he's talking
[1:14:59] to Eve right he said unto the woman ye
[1:15:03] hath God said ye shall not eat every
[1:15:05] tree of the garden now now look at what
[1:15:07] what what the servant is doing he's
[1:15:09] actually Amen brother random say he's uh
[1:15:12] he's not quoting the word but he's
[1:15:14] coding the word and here what the devil
[1:15:16] going to do the devil going to try to
[1:15:17] use the word against
[1:15:20] youh amen sir that's why not it's good
[1:15:25] for the Sisters to make sure that they
[1:15:26] you know before you just run off with a
[1:15:28] revelation go back to your husband and
[1:15:30] and and run that thing through him and
[1:15:32] if you don't have a husband right then
[1:15:34] you're running through the
[1:15:36] pastor amen make sure that thing is
[1:15:39] lining up just right amen uh uh and and
[1:15:43] and for for young ladies they can go to
[1:15:45] their father make sure it lines up right
[1:15:47] so said the woman said unto the serpent
[1:15:50] we may eat of the fruit of the Trees of
[1:15:52] the garden but of the fruit of the tree
[1:15:54] which is in the midst of the garden God
[1:15:56] have said ye shall not eat of it neither
[1:15:58] shall you touch it lest ye die right in
[1:16:02] verse four and servant said unto the
[1:16:03] woman ye shall not surely die all he did
[1:16:06] was add one word to what God Said God
[1:16:09] said you're going to die he said You
[1:16:10] shall not surely die right and uh so he
[1:16:13] added one word and that one word threw
[1:16:15] everything out of out out of out out
[1:16:17] into chaos right for God doth know that
[1:16:20] in the day you eat thereof then your
[1:16:22] eyes shall be open and ye shall be as
[1:16:24] Gods knowing good and evil look at them
[1:16:28] tricker now look at them tricker verse
[1:16:29] six next says and when the woman saw
[1:16:33] that the tree was good for food now I'm
[1:16:36] just again I I I'm one that believes um
[1:16:40] this was not a one-time
[1:16:43] conversation this was something that he
[1:16:45] just kept working now now I need you to
[1:16:48] understand something about the serpent
[1:16:49] the serpent was something made by God it
[1:16:52] was not not an evil Beast it was made by
[1:16:56] God go I mean here here even God brought
[1:16:58] all the animals to to Adam for him to
[1:17:00] name Adam knew this serpent the only
[1:17:03] thing about the serpent that it had the
[1:17:05] ability to talk just like a human could
[1:17:08] talk it could reason just like a human
[1:17:10] could reason so Satan knew that this
[1:17:13] this animal was in the garden Hallelujah
[1:17:16] and when Satan got kicked out of heaven
[1:17:19] come on he dropped down into that beast
[1:17:22] and this was not the serpent talking
[1:17:24] this was Satan inside the serpent
[1:17:27] talking
[1:17:30] am it was Satan that was talking you got
[1:17:32] be a you got to be able to recognize
[1:17:34] when the devil is
[1:17:37] talking and and let me make it very
[1:17:39] clear the devil will use the
[1:17:43] word to talk to you right the devil will
[1:17:47] use the word to talk to so be very
[1:17:49] careful you got to know whether that's
[1:17:50] God or whether that's the devil right
[1:17:52] all right MH that's what he used to with
[1:17:54] Eve he used the word this one something
[1:17:56] way out he used the word and he tricked
[1:17:58] her on one word now let's go he says
[1:18:00] this and when the woman saw the tree was
[1:18:02] good for food that means she got
[1:18:03] involved in something here that's how
[1:18:05] she saw it was good for food she said
[1:18:07] and that it was pleasant to their eyes
[1:18:09] and a tree to be desired to make one
[1:18:11] wise she took of the fruit thereof and
[1:18:12] did eat and look at this and gave also
[1:18:15] unto her husband with her and he did eat
[1:18:18] now Adam was with her when she had this
[1:18:21] act but Adam was with her in the garden
[1:18:25] so she came and introduced what happened
[1:18:27] to her to Adam it was the woman that did
[1:18:29] this and because of what happened to the
[1:18:31] woman praise the Lord let me uh do
[1:18:35] something because of what happened to
[1:18:37] the woman amen uh it put her in a
[1:18:40] different
[1:18:41] position Amen in God's
[1:18:44] order all right all right all right all
[1:18:46] right let's let's let's look at this
[1:18:49] verse um verse 7 says and the eyes of
[1:18:52] them both were open and they knew that
[1:18:54] they were naked now they didn't know
[1:18:56] this because they had a a veil on before
[1:18:59] amen but now the veil is taken away and
[1:19:01] uh and and and here's here's the other
[1:19:03] problem uh when they sin here they
[1:19:06] recognize amen that they was
[1:19:08] naked this is what happened in the very
[1:19:11] beginning now unfortunately Today We
[1:19:13] Live in an age where people are blind
[1:19:17] miserable wretched they're also naked
[1:19:22] but they don't even know
[1:19:24] it amen you talk about a mental
[1:19:27] condition they they have that problem
[1:19:28] right here today all right so it says uh
[1:19:31] they were naked and they seed fig leaves
[1:19:32] together and made themselves aprons and
[1:19:34] they heard the voice of the Lord God
[1:19:36] walking in the in the garden in the cool
[1:19:38] of the day and Adam and his wife hid
[1:19:40] themselves from the presence of the Lord
[1:19:41] God amongst the Trees of the garden next
[1:19:43] he says and the Lord God called unto
[1:19:46] Adam said unto him where art thou and he
[1:19:48] said I heard thy voice in the garden and
[1:19:51] I was afraid
[1:19:54] because I was naked this is new language
[1:19:57] this is new Adam never heard this word
[1:19:59] before right but after this act he
[1:20:01] recognized something went wrong now now
[1:20:03] let's look at this let's look at this
[1:20:05] and I hid myself and it said who told
[1:20:08] thee that thou was naked hast thou eaten
[1:20:11] of the tree whereever I commanded thee
[1:20:12] thou should us not eat and the man said
[1:20:15] the woman whom thou gavest to be with me
[1:20:19] she gave me of the tree and I did eat
[1:20:21] that is Adam passing the buck Adam is
[1:20:24] blaming Eve but Adam himself got
[1:20:27] involved in this now now here the thing
[1:20:29] is the scripture tells us Adam amen was
[1:20:32] not deceived Eve was but Adam wasn't
[1:20:35] Adam willfully walked out into this
[1:20:38] Hallelujah he knew if God would take Eve
[1:20:40] out he have to take him out as well yeah
[1:20:42] amen Adam could not redeem Eve there was
[1:20:44] nothing in him to redeem only Christ can
[1:20:46] do to Redemption but Adam willfully
[1:20:48] walked out hallelujah hallelujah
[1:20:51] hallelujah Hall Hallelujah one of the
[1:20:53] things brother brand said here about
[1:20:55] what happened in the Garden of Eden he
[1:20:56] says a woman can be deceived a thousand
[1:20:58] times quicker than a man amen a woman
[1:21:03] can be
[1:21:04] deceived a thousand times quicker than a
[1:21:07] man
[1:21:09] right now I'mma just I'mma just put it
[1:21:11] like this God and brother Jonathan said
[1:21:14] it when he was here God put certain
[1:21:16] things inside of a man that's not inside
[1:21:19] of a woman and God put certain things
[1:21:21] inside of a woman that's not inside of
[1:21:23] the man and once we find our order find
[1:21:27] our place then the family functions the
[1:21:29] way it's supposed to
[1:21:30] function praise the Lord especially when
[1:21:32] it come to spiritual things don't I mean
[1:21:34] a sister should not try to lead in those
[1:21:36] spiritual thing let your husband do the
[1:21:38] lead and make sure look God put you in
[1:21:40] this place God call you to this place
[1:21:43] God equip you with certain things you
[1:21:45] got to lead this
[1:21:47] family don't don't go on the other side
[1:21:49] well he won't do it so I'm going just
[1:21:50] jump don't do that you get out of the
[1:21:52] way will of God when you do
[1:21:54] that I'm going keep preaching I'm going
[1:21:57] keep preaching it's all right thank
[1:22:00] y'all for the few amens I I appreciate
[1:22:02] them but I'm not here to get
[1:22:05] amens I'm not here to get amens and
[1:22:07] because I you know like brother quu say
[1:22:09] they sometime they be coerced uhhuh uhuh
[1:22:12] and then sometimes it's just uh it's
[1:22:14] something that's just coming from the
[1:22:15] depths of your soul and and and coer if
[1:22:18] we have to co an amen it's not a genine
[1:22:20] amen that's right the other thing I
[1:22:22] found about uh preaching is that
[1:22:24] sometime people say
[1:22:25] amen
[1:22:29] hey get off that preacher amen amen amen
[1:22:33] amen amen amen no no no no no no no no
[1:22:35] no no no no I'mma keep I'mma keep right
[1:22:37] on this line we talking about the Family
[1:22:45] series verse 9 says and the Lord God
[1:22:47] called on Adam and said to him where art
[1:22:49] thou and he said I heard thy voice in
[1:22:51] the garden and I was afraid because th
[1:22:52] was naked I H hid myself and he said who
[1:22:54] told thee that thou was naked hast thou
[1:22:56] eaten of the tree whereof I commanded
[1:22:58] thee that thou should us not eat and the
[1:22:59] man said the woman that whom thou gavest
[1:23:02] with to be with me she gave me of the
[1:23:04] tree and I did eat and the Lord God
[1:23:08] verse uh uh verse 13 says the Lord God
[1:23:10] said unto the woman what is this that
[1:23:13] thou Hast done and the woman said the
[1:23:16] serpent begot me and I did
[1:23:19] eat and the Lord God said unto the
[1:23:21] serpent because thou has done this thou
[1:23:23] are cursed above all cattle now look at
[1:23:24] what happens here these are the
[1:23:26] punishments being dissed out I'm not
[1:23:27] going to go through all of them amen but
[1:23:30] uh but here it starts with H with the
[1:23:31] serpent says um uh the Lord God said to
[1:23:34] the serpent because thou has done this
[1:23:36] Thou Art cursed above all cattle and
[1:23:39] above every beast of the field upon thy
[1:23:41] belly shalt thou go and thust shalt thou
[1:23:44] eat all the days of life so here the
[1:23:46] serpent loses his
[1:23:48] legs he used to stand on two feet like a
[1:23:51] man but in this spot he loses his legs
[1:23:53] and now he's on his
[1:23:55] belly and he's the missing link between
[1:23:58] man and and and and Animal Kingdom
[1:24:01] hallelujah it's the serpent that's the
[1:24:03] missing link glory to God got cursed in
[1:24:05] the Garden of Eden and that's why
[1:24:07] they'll never find until they unless
[1:24:09] they can believe what really happened in
[1:24:10] Genesis they'll never find what
[1:24:13] happened all right here and and and the
[1:24:16] next verse says and I will put enmity
[1:24:19] between thee and the woman and between
[1:24:21] thy seed and her seed it shall bruise
[1:24:23] thy head and thou shall bruise his he
[1:24:25] that verse alone is speaking of the
[1:24:27] coming of the Lord Jesus Christ because
[1:24:30] a woman does not have a seed she has an
[1:24:32] egg that has to be fertilized with a
[1:24:35] male seed Hallelujah but but since she
[1:24:39] since he says thy seed amen it said uh
[1:24:42] between thy seat and her seed her seed
[1:24:44] was talking about the birth of the Lord
[1:24:46] Jesus Christ cuz he was the only one
[1:24:49] born on this Earth on without a human
[1:24:52] sensation yes sir God created the the
[1:24:55] the sperm and the Egg and he brought
[1:24:57] forth Jesus Christ sir so I can just
[1:25:00] tell you even in the midst of this
[1:25:03] so-called mistake God had a plan amen
[1:25:07] amen God had a plan amen and it was it
[1:25:09] was being executed so God want I mean
[1:25:12] nothing happens out of out of you know
[1:25:15] just just happen stance God always got a
[1:25:18] plan for what he's doing yes sir all
[1:25:20] right all right now here verse says unto
[1:25:23] the woman he said I will greatly
[1:25:24] multiply thy sorrow and thy conception
[1:25:28] and sorrow sh thou bring forth children
[1:25:31] and you know and and and all y'all
[1:25:32] sisters that done had a baby y'all know
[1:25:35] this ain't nothing but the truth what
[1:25:37] what the Bible say here my my my my my
[1:25:39] daughter just come through having a
[1:25:40] child and my my son-in-law said that she
[1:25:43] was just a different woman when the baby
[1:25:45] was coming for she was just doing some
[1:25:48] things that just wasn't one didn't seem
[1:25:50] normal and she's saying things and I
[1:25:52] mean and you know everybody get out of
[1:25:54] here I don't want to see nobody in this
[1:25:56] I mean just you know it
[1:25:58] just this is the scripture this is this
[1:26:01] is some this is something that happened
[1:26:03] this was a result of what happened in
[1:26:05] the Garden of Eden and and it's
[1:26:07] something how a woman can go through all
[1:26:09] that pain and and and and and and and
[1:26:11] and and get push that baby out into the
[1:26:13] world or even if she goes through a
[1:26:15] cesarian birth or whatever go through
[1:26:17] all that pain have to be cut and sewed
[1:26:19] up and go through all that pain and then
[1:26:21] somehow get a Feeling
[1:26:26] start talking to her husband about let
[1:26:28] let's do this again
[1:26:32] how I I I tried to tell you there
[1:26:34] certain things that's inside a woman
[1:26:36] that's right and they not inside of a
[1:26:38] man because as a man if if if we had to
[1:26:42] get birth like that I can tell you right
[1:26:44] now now we wouldn't have too many
[1:26:47] children on the
[1:26:51] Earth
[1:26:57] unto the woman he said I will greatly
[1:26:59] multiply thy sorrow and thy conception
[1:27:01] and sorrow shalt thou bring forth
[1:27:02] children and thy
[1:27:05] desire shall be to thy husband that's
[1:27:07] right and he shall rule over
[1:27:13] thee this is the scripture he shall rule
[1:27:17] over thee and here's here's the problem
[1:27:19] and like I say I know we live we live in
[1:27:21] a in a very EXP expensive area of the
[1:27:24] world and it's and many wives have to go
[1:27:27] out to work and so I wouldn't come up
[1:27:29] here and preach against the women
[1:27:30] working I if if you can do it you know I
[1:27:34] if your household can afford it it's a
[1:27:35] it's a great thing if your household can
[1:27:37] afford it but I wouldn't sit here and
[1:27:38] try to I I know churches that that that
[1:27:41] just kind of um they make people feel
[1:27:43] bad if their wife's not at home they
[1:27:47] make them feel bad I'm not here to put
[1:27:48] no guilt trip on you I will tell you
[1:27:50] this that the original
[1:27:52] plan of God was for the husband to go
[1:27:54] out to work and the wife to take care of
[1:27:56] the children that's the original plan of
[1:27:58] God if you can if you can somehow find a
[1:28:00] way to fit that original plan I would
[1:28:01] say do it you might have to cut back on
[1:28:03] some of your expenses to do it amen but
[1:28:06] I know sometimes wives do have to go out
[1:28:08] to work but here's the issue when you go
[1:28:10] out there sis understand you got to you
[1:28:12] got even if you boss on the job on
[1:28:17] right you don't got promoted and you
[1:28:20] boss you telling everybody what to what
[1:28:22] to do as you driving
[1:28:28] home as as you driving home you got have
[1:28:30] to switch a
[1:28:33] gear right you going have to dial it way
[1:28:37] down cuz you ain't boss at the
[1:28:40] house can I go a little further brother
[1:28:43] roel came to our church and said this
[1:28:45] I'mma say this I love it when he said it
[1:28:48] brother Roy say if if if God has blessed
[1:28:50] you sister to make amen
[1:28:53] $11,000 a week and your husband is
[1:28:56] making $100 a week you know what your
[1:28:59] $1,000 is to his $100 is a
[1:29:04] help amen that's right and if you can
[1:29:07] look at it that way you keep everything
[1:29:09] in line right amen amen amen
[1:29:13] hallelujah
[1:29:16] amen let's go
[1:29:20] forward
[1:29:23] next this is a woman's Nation brother
[1:29:25] brandom tells us
[1:29:27] that and he makes a statement says
[1:29:29] notice what takes place Jezebel she
[1:29:31] ruled
[1:29:34] Ahab she slammed them
[1:29:37] around it used to be poor Papa or Mama
[1:29:39] set home with the baby babies while the
[1:29:42] drunken husband was out poor Papa now
[1:29:46] takes care of the baby while the drunken
[1:29:48] woman is out now that's not a joke
[1:29:50] that's the truth I'm not speaking of
[1:29:52] righteous people no sir now this is
[1:29:55] important that's why I underline it I'm
[1:29:56] only
[1:29:57] showing the spirit that is in the world
[1:30:02] there is a spirit in the world now now
[1:30:06] now now now now let me just go I'm I'm
[1:30:09] going to go a little further he said
[1:30:09] this is woman Nation I want to show you
[1:30:11] some of the spirits that have come in
[1:30:12] the world uh first amen just hit next
[1:30:16] just uh first thing in 1933 brother
[1:30:19] Brandon prophesied it didn't it didn't
[1:30:20] it didn't seem like this would happen in
[1:30:22] 1933 but he prophesied there would be a
[1:30:25] woman president or vice president and it
[1:30:29] said also it could type out the Catholic
[1:30:31] church he told us that right and we are
[1:30:34] living in the time of the prophecy being
[1:30:37] fulfilled we have a woman vice president
[1:30:40] right now and a prophet told us that in
[1:30:43] 1933 yes sir that's
[1:30:46] true now when you see a woman president
[1:30:49] vice president you see just the the
[1:30:51] where where women have reached to there
[1:30:53] was a time where women could even
[1:30:56] vote now look at where we are amen and I
[1:31:00] mean and and Lord have mercy I shouldn't
[1:31:03] say this from the pull pit I shouldn't
[1:31:04] say
[1:31:06] it some of the people that they give us
[1:31:09] to choose from to be
[1:31:12] president are so
[1:31:15] questionable
[1:31:17] amen that it forces the people to vote a
[1:31:20] certain way
[1:31:23] because we got very questionable
[1:31:31] characters the next statement I want to
[1:31:33] just make here in the 1960s and
[1:31:36] 70s women's rights there was a movement
[1:31:39] women's rights now now part of this amen
[1:31:42] uh the women's Liberation and women's
[1:31:43] rights movement in the 60s and 7s they
[1:31:46] sought equal opportunity and and and uh
[1:31:48] also greater personal freedom for women
[1:31:50] now here's the thing when I say it's
[1:31:52] spirits that we're fighting because part
[1:31:53] of is it it seems so it's right right
[1:31:56] now you know if if if my wife have to
[1:31:58] work if she has to work I don't want her
[1:32:02] to go to a job and get paid less doing
[1:32:04] the same job that if a man was there
[1:32:07] doing the job he get paid more I
[1:32:09] everybody know that that's
[1:32:11] wrong but so when they start pushing
[1:32:13] this amen with the the the the Equal
[1:32:16] Rights and and Liberation there was a
[1:32:18] spirit
[1:32:20] there and seem right here let me just
[1:32:23] put it this way there's a
[1:32:25] way right that seeth right unto men but
[1:32:28] the end thereof are the ways of
[1:32:31] death and what it was doing was just
[1:32:33] kind of setting us up and getting us out
[1:32:34] of the order that God had established
[1:32:37] for the family yes
[1:32:39] sir
[1:32:42] Spirits brother random say this is a
[1:32:44] woman Nation next thing he said you just
[1:32:45] look at our symbol of Freedom next
[1:32:48] Statue of Liberty is our symbol of
[1:32:49] Freedom it's a woman amen that's our
[1:32:53] symbol of freedom for the United States
[1:32:54] of America he also said next that the
[1:32:57] flag was made by a
[1:32:59] woman and you know where this really
[1:33:01] come from is the church because the next
[1:33:04] one says that we have the worship of
[1:33:07] Mary over Christ so this spirit is
[1:33:12] released from the church and it trickles
[1:33:14] down into everything else yes sir
[1:33:18] amen but we trying to get back to Bible
[1:33:22] order look at this what the prophet says
[1:33:24] in this next segment it says out of the
[1:33:26] message just one more time Lord says a
[1:33:27] woman said I have a right to do what I
[1:33:28] want to
[1:33:31] do that's my American
[1:33:34] privilege the prophet say it is your
[1:33:36] American
[1:33:37] privilege It Ain't Your god-given
[1:33:40] Privilege
[1:33:41] though and what we're trying to do is
[1:33:43] get back to our god-given
[1:33:45] privileges hello
[1:33:48] somebody all right we're going further
[1:33:52] amen
[1:33:55] next says this I I want to just first uh
[1:33:58] bring this in when when when the Bible's
[1:34:00] asking or not even asking it's it's it's
[1:34:03] telling the wives that they need be be
[1:34:06] be submissive submit yourselves amen
[1:34:09] wives submit yourselves unto your own
[1:34:10] husbands as unto the Lord and I want to
[1:34:12] just put this submission is a choice
[1:34:14] from your
[1:34:16] heart it's something that you choose to
[1:34:18] do you choose either to submit or not to
[1:34:20] submit it's a choice from your heart
[1:34:24] look at this
[1:34:28] amen
[1:34:31] next a woman is not meant to have an
[1:34:36] iron
[1:34:38] disposition so it it it shouldn't be the
[1:34:40] woman saying I'mma put my foot
[1:34:47] down hello that's right I'mma put my
[1:34:51] foot down I'm I'mma say how it's going
[1:34:53] to go around a woman not meant supposed
[1:34:55] to have that that
[1:34:57] disposition anytime you get something
[1:34:59] like that you know a
[1:35:01] spirit has jumped on top of you
[1:35:04] amen hello
[1:35:06] somebody amen I told you it's going to
[1:35:09] get quiet it's all right it's the word
[1:35:11] anyhow brother brother brother brother
[1:35:13] quu told me they thinking about it I'm
[1:35:15] going to let you think about
[1:35:17] [Applause]
[1:35:18] it a woman is not meant to have an iron
[1:35:23] disposition she is according to the Holy
[1:35:26] scripture to be submissive to the male
[1:35:28] that is commanded of her amen a woman
[1:35:33] who is truly female and look at that
[1:35:36] that word again all
[1:35:41] female will be of that disposition look
[1:35:44] at this not a
[1:35:46] doormat amen no real male makes a female
[1:35:50] a doormat but she will want to be under
[1:35:53] Authority and not to rule over the male
[1:35:55] for he is the head of the
[1:35:57] house if she breaks the image that God
[1:36:01] made for her she is perverted amen all
[1:36:05] right she is perverted oh I I I I I
[1:36:09] thank God for the prophet and him just
[1:36:11] kind of bringing these truths right back
[1:36:12] to us amen no she's not supposed to just
[1:36:15] be handled any kind of way right and
[1:36:17] this is not you know anytime a a
[1:36:19] preacher has to deal with this subject
[1:36:21] they just feel like it's it's trying a
[1:36:22] man being chauvinistic or something like
[1:36:25] that that's a spirit y'all that's a
[1:36:27] spirit it's not chauvinism we're trying
[1:36:29] to get back to Bible
[1:36:31] order Bible order and and this is why
[1:36:34] when I started this whole family series
[1:36:35] I started with the husbands husbands
[1:36:37] love your wives I started with that and
[1:36:39] let me tell you when a husband truly
[1:36:41] loves his wife his wife easily submits
[1:36:43] to everything that he
[1:36:45] wants the key to unlocking submission is
[1:36:48] the husband actually loving the wives as
[1:36:50] Christ love the
[1:36:52] church amen it's right here in the
[1:36:55] scripture yes sir submit means to be
[1:37:00] subject
[1:37:01] unto to submit oneself to to arrange
[1:37:06] under to subordinate to
[1:37:09] subject uh is is to obey to to to to to
[1:37:14] submit one's control can I work with
[1:37:16] that for a little bit when we talk about
[1:37:18] submission is to submit one's control
[1:37:21] hello
[1:37:23] somebody because you know sometimes our
[1:37:26] sisters amen and again you're made this
[1:37:28] way you can't help it sometimes you know
[1:37:31] with the sisters they they need to
[1:37:33] understand exactly all the details they
[1:37:35] need to know them
[1:37:37] details oh y'all ain't going to talk to
[1:37:39] me truth they they they must how is this
[1:37:42] going how we going to do this and how we
[1:37:44] going to do that and I mean you need to
[1:37:45] explain this thing out and when and when
[1:37:48] the husband is saying look I'm just I'm
[1:37:50] believing God he hasn't told me how to
[1:37:52] do it yet I don't know what to do I I I
[1:37:55] I I know I'm going from part from point
[1:37:57] A to point B but how we going to get
[1:37:59] there I don't know and then it's hard
[1:38:02] for the wife to submit herself to a guy
[1:38:03] that just don't
[1:38:09] know and then what happens is then she
[1:38:11] begin to try to take control I believe
[1:38:14] we at Point a and we're going to point B
[1:38:16] but I'm going I'm going to get us
[1:38:19] there my Lord when do that you break the
[1:38:22] image that God
[1:38:23] has for your family amen
[1:38:27] Lord submit to one's control yield to
[1:38:31] one's admonition or advice yield to
[1:38:34] one's admonition or advice so that means
[1:38:37] we going to talk about it but you know
[1:38:39] what the final say in the house has got
[1:38:40] to be the
[1:38:42] husband now he may agree with you and he
[1:38:44] may not agree with you but in your house
[1:38:46] you got to make your husband the final
[1:38:48] say Amen hello somebody that's that's
[1:38:51] what being submissive and sub and
[1:38:53] subject and the other thing is as a
[1:38:55] husband he won't be there just because I
[1:38:57] said
[1:38:58] so you ain't got no scripture to support
[1:39:01] your position or nothing my brother just
[1:39:03] because you said
[1:39:05] so well make what make that right how
[1:39:08] you following Christ that's right
[1:39:11] brother so you going to have to use the
[1:39:12] word in these I mean you going to have
[1:39:14] to pray and seek out God give me
[1:39:15] something out of the scripture you got
[1:39:17] to be reading the scripture if you want
[1:39:19] to get something out of the scripture
[1:39:22] God give me something out the scripture
[1:39:23] maybe maybe I'm listening to a tape give
[1:39:25] me something the prophet that I can take
[1:39:27] and give my wife just a little comfort
[1:39:29] and consolation that God got this thing
[1:39:31] under control amen my wife my wife told
[1:39:35] me sometime that's all she want to hear
[1:39:36] me says God got it under control and it
[1:39:40] she said just something about me saying
[1:39:42] it God got it under control it's going
[1:39:45] to be all right dear we going to be okay
[1:39:48] I I don't know how I know he going to
[1:39:51] make a way and then maybe sometime take
[1:39:52] your wife through a journey of where God
[1:39:54] has already brought you from remember we
[1:39:57] was up against it one time and God did
[1:39:58] this and and God did that and God did
[1:40:01] this and it causes her to start thinking
[1:40:03] a little different when you can share
[1:40:04] testimonies like that sir it comes a
[1:40:07] spirit
[1:40:09] down amen she don't want that iron
[1:40:13] disposition but what you doing to kind
[1:40:14] of keep that away from
[1:40:16] her right
[1:40:18] hello amen
[1:40:21] when she takes on the iron disposition
[1:40:23] she breaks the image that God made for
[1:40:25] her here the next one brother brandom
[1:40:28] says this in the message we would see
[1:40:30] Jesus just like why does a woman every
[1:40:33] time she gets married put a veil over
[1:40:34] her face she's coming to her husband the
[1:40:38] head just like Rebecca did she put a
[1:40:41] veil over her face to meet Isaac she has
[1:40:44] no more head Isaac is her head and the
[1:40:47] church ought to be so so submissive to
[1:40:49] the word of God that it veils s its own
[1:40:52] face it has no head look he says the
[1:40:55] nature of a woman is to submit to a man
[1:40:58] God put that in a woman to be able to
[1:41:00] submit to a man and that's what the
[1:41:02] church ought to be doing submitting to
[1:41:04] Christ to his word to his Doctrine to
[1:41:06] his principles she takes no thought for
[1:41:08] herself she has no head Christ is heard
[1:41:10] not some
[1:41:12] ecclesiastical uh Bunch but Christ ishe
[1:41:14] the word and the Word was made flesh and
[1:41:16] dwelt among us hallelujah now you know
[1:41:18] um Colossians 3:18 also tells us wives
[1:41:21] submit yourselves unto your own husbands
[1:41:23] as is fit in the Lord It's a woman is
[1:41:26] made her nature is to submit to a man
[1:41:29] her nature is to submit to a man now I
[1:41:31] want to I want to I want to add a couple
[1:41:33] things here uh the Bible tells us
[1:41:35] Colossians 3:18 like I just quote it but
[1:41:37] there was a a a question asked and I
[1:41:39] didn't bring this quote up don't worry
[1:41:40] about trying to pull up the quote just
[1:41:42] leave the the slide there but there was
[1:41:44] a question asked to brother brandom one
[1:41:45] time says should a wife obey a husband
[1:41:48] I'm a Christian and my husband is a
[1:41:49] sinner he persecute me in every way that
[1:41:51] he can for me not to go to church and
[1:41:54] read my Bible and denies the word what
[1:41:55] should I do uh what what should you do
[1:41:58] not listen you're supposed to obey your
[1:42:00] husband that's that's the word now if he
[1:42:02] tells you and refuses you to read your
[1:42:04] read the Bible go to church or something
[1:42:06] like that you don't have to obey
[1:42:10] that amen amen so so cuz it's a woman's
[1:42:14] nature to submit and and Men know this
[1:42:17] and sometimes a woman don't realize a
[1:42:19] man will take advantage of your
[1:42:22] nature and he will use scripture to take
[1:42:25] advantage of your nature that's right
[1:42:27] hello somebody am amen you want to make
[1:42:30] sure he's not doing this in a way that
[1:42:32] he's doing things in a way of love not
[1:42:33] in a way to try to uh uh manipulate
[1:42:36] you cuz that's what s he was using
[1:42:39] scripture to manipulate Eve in the
[1:42:41] beginning and you still have men the
[1:42:42] Daya to do the same thing if he's
[1:42:44] getting you to do something that's
[1:42:45] outside the word of God you don't have
[1:42:47] to obey that amen amen you don't have to
[1:42:51] obey that because he that will not
[1:42:52] forsake his father's mother husband wife
[1:42:55] or whatsoever it is and follow me is not
[1:42:57] worthy of mine so brother brandom clears
[1:42:59] that up now let me go a little further
[1:43:01] here cuz um I I mentioned earlier that
[1:43:04] sometimes a wife would like to try to
[1:43:05] take control over things and and and and
[1:43:08] there was a time like I I want to read
[1:43:10] not read but I want to just have you
[1:43:12] think of the story of
[1:43:14] Rebecca my there was a time Rebecca was
[1:43:16] so submissive to the will of God here
[1:43:19] come Eliza praying like Lord let the the
[1:43:23] young lady that comes out and not only
[1:43:24] offer me water but offer water to my
[1:43:26] camels let her be the one that I'm going
[1:43:28] to take to Isaac right back to to Isaac
[1:43:30] I I let let that be the one and soon as
[1:43:33] Ela says amen Here Comes Rebecca to Amen
[1:43:36] to to the well and she's hey you want
[1:43:39] some water well let me get some water
[1:43:40] for your camels he knew right then oh my
[1:43:42] this is it he begin to give her gifts
[1:43:44] and and all kind of things and and then
[1:43:46] he said where your house at I got to go
[1:43:48] talk to your dad I got to tell him this
[1:43:49] testimony what just happened God just
[1:43:51] heard my prayer and uh and and I'm here
[1:43:53] representing Abraham and I'm looking for
[1:43:55] a wife for Isaac and he he didn't want
[1:43:56] no wife from back there he wanted one
[1:43:58] from right here and uh and say and you
[1:44:00] the one I believe God is sending to
[1:44:02] Isaac so he went back and talked to the
[1:44:04] family and the brother the mother the
[1:44:06] father and and all of them was sitting
[1:44:07] there saying well you know what we
[1:44:09] believe the testimony but let us stay
[1:44:10] for about 10 more days and uh she they
[1:44:13] say they said no no don't delay me I got
[1:44:15] to go now God is moving now I need to
[1:44:17] take her back right now and they say
[1:44:18] well I tell you what let her decide on
[1:44:21] what she'll do Rebecca said I will go
[1:44:23] never met this man never seen this man
[1:44:26] just heard the testimonies about this
[1:44:28] man she say I will go she was willing to
[1:44:30] leave her daddy's house and submit
[1:44:33] herself to a man she did not
[1:44:37] know she did it she went there and got
[1:44:40] married to Isaac that's Genesis 24
[1:44:44] Genesis 25 she was pregnant with two
[1:44:46] twins and as she got pregnant with these
[1:44:48] two twins uh she began to pray she began
[1:44:51] to seek God about what was going on
[1:44:52] inside of her womb and she was told by
[1:44:54] God that the older will serve the
[1:44:56] younger God gave her an answer to her
[1:44:58] prayer now here in Genesis 26 we see
[1:45:01] this same Rebecca that submitted herself
[1:45:05] Amen to leaving her daddy's house and go
[1:45:07] here to marry man she did not know when
[1:45:09] she get to Genesis 26 now she is
[1:45:11] deceiving her own
[1:45:16] husband yeah and and and and my question
[1:45:19] is how does
[1:45:21] a a a sister go from amen being a
[1:45:24] submissive female Amen to her husband
[1:45:28] now she get a few chapters later in her
[1:45:30] life and now she want to rule
[1:45:34] everything what happened to
[1:45:36] Rebecca what happened in this house that
[1:45:39] caused Rebecca to do some of the things
[1:45:40] she did she didn't have to help God out
[1:45:43] right by trying to help God out it
[1:45:46] actually only amen messed up the process
[1:45:49] but here she's just deing her own
[1:45:51] husband by telling her something now you
[1:45:52] need to dress this way you need to do
[1:45:54] this you need to do that and and I'm
[1:45:55] going to make you some you know some
[1:45:57] lentils and I'm going to give you this
[1:45:59] to go there I I'mma dress up the meat
[1:46:01] and I'mma do all this and I'm G make
[1:46:02] this thing taste like like your brother
[1:46:04] cooked it why is she doing something
[1:46:06] like watch she trying to control the
[1:46:08] situation how do we move from this place
[1:46:12] to this place Lord It's a
[1:46:15] spirit that comes in somewhere that
[1:46:18] causes Rebecca to become this type of
[1:46:20] woman yes sir now it didn't stop God's
[1:46:23] word from being manifested in her family
[1:46:26] but it certainly delayed some things she
[1:46:28] went years without seeing her son
[1:46:31] because of what she did and and can you
[1:46:33] imagine the other son right can you
[1:46:36] imagine the other son Esau when he
[1:46:39] probably figured out what happened he he
[1:46:41] probably my my my brother Jacob my
[1:46:43] brother Jacob my brother Jacob but then
[1:46:45] when he realized my my own
[1:46:48] Mama right you mean my mama was in in
[1:46:53] involved in this and I actually wasn't
[1:46:55] even it was my mama's
[1:46:58] plan come on can let me let me just drop
[1:47:01] this off right here for the parents Mam
[1:47:04] and daddies do don't you ever show
[1:47:08] favoritism to one child over the
[1:47:12] others amen amen you create problems in
[1:47:17] your own house when you do do
[1:47:23] that spirits that do this just something
[1:47:26] for you to think
[1:47:28] about let's go into the next
[1:47:31] one the prophet says uh oh for the grace
[1:47:33] of God that he give us understanding of
[1:47:35] such great Mysteries as Paul here
[1:47:38] further Amen on down in Ephesians
[1:47:40] speaking of the husband and wife it said
[1:47:42] this is a mystery how the woman should
[1:47:44] be in respect to their husband even the
[1:47:47] second place I believe it is uh in the
[1:47:49] entire Bible that reverence was ever
[1:47:51] spoke spoke to said the woman seeing she
[1:47:53] reverence her husband reverence her
[1:47:55] husband then a husband ought to live
[1:47:56] such a life before his wife that his
[1:47:58] wife could reverence him as as a Son of
[1:48:00] God and if he doesn't live that kind of
[1:48:02] life well then of course she wouldn't
[1:48:03] reverence him because she knows what
[1:48:05] he's made of but when it is a man that
[1:48:07] is when but when uh but but when it is a
[1:48:10] man that is reverent rever and clean
[1:48:12] with his wife and before his family a
[1:48:14] real servant of God then the women
[1:48:16] children all should respect that servant
[1:48:17] of God with a reverence Now understand
[1:48:19] that was really based on uh a man and
[1:48:22] the life that he lived that actually
[1:48:23] produces the reverence from his wife and
[1:48:26] what brother Rand is referring to a
[1:48:27] scripture in Ephesians 5:33 nevertheless
[1:48:29] let every one of you in particular so
[1:48:31] love his wife even as himself and the
[1:48:33] wife see that she reverence her husband
[1:48:37] now I want to talk about that amen what
[1:48:39] does this really look
[1:48:42] like it's reverencing the husband before
[1:48:45] we get there let me remind you
[1:48:49] something you can hit
[1:48:53] next I'm not going to read this whole
[1:48:54] quote just to underline Parts I
[1:48:58] believe
[1:49:00] anything that
[1:49:03] helps the human race is
[1:49:07] Godly and the other thing the prover
[1:49:09] says is you got to look at
[1:49:12] anything sensible right if you if you if
[1:49:16] you fail to look at things sensible then
[1:49:18] you're going to miss it like I told
[1:49:19] y'all my my I preach from my experience
[1:49:22] and I didn't put the disclaimer out
[1:49:23] there but I put it out there again when
[1:49:24] I'm preaching this the spirit and Truth
[1:49:26] Tabernacle uh I'm preaching from my
[1:49:28] experience amen and uh and and some of
[1:49:31] the things that I've gone through in my
[1:49:32] journey I've been exposed to teachings
[1:49:36] am man that I think are very helpful it
[1:49:38] helped me in my ma my marriage I have
[1:49:41] gone to to marriage seminars and message
[1:49:45] churches they don't do it oh y'all ain't
[1:49:47] going to talk to me but message churches
[1:49:49] they don't don't do marriage seminars
[1:49:52] they don't they just think y'all got the
[1:49:53] word and y'all should be able to do
[1:49:54] something with it but y'all got the word
[1:49:56] with
[1:49:58] problems and don't know how to figure it
[1:50:01] out amen amen amen it's a truth in house
[1:50:06] right I mean you know we we have we have
[1:50:08] we have a lot of problems in the message
[1:50:10] in Mar in homes and and there's been
[1:50:13] nobody to go out there and try to bring
[1:50:15] anything to help us right I know some
[1:50:18] Churches they don't even counsel
[1:50:20] Families my Lord but and the family
[1:50:22] struggling over here they don't even
[1:50:24] know how to figure their way out of this
[1:50:25] you know and they won't even try to
[1:50:27] spend any time with them true but I I I
[1:50:29] have been exposed to things I I call
[1:50:31] them tools because they're tools that
[1:50:33] will help my marriage so I like to share
[1:50:36] those tools with people wherever I go
[1:50:38] anytime I'm asked to speak amen about
[1:50:41] marriage people going to get these tools
[1:50:43] that I've been given amen they help me
[1:50:46] all right look at this I I brought this
[1:50:48] in the last time cuz this this first uh
[1:50:50] before it talk talked about wives
[1:50:52] submitting themselves to their their
[1:50:54] husbands first in verse 21 it in in
[1:50:57] Ephesians 5:21 it says submitting
[1:50:59] yourselves one to another in the fear of
[1:51:01] God and I brought this out the way that
[1:51:02] we do that is uh hit next is with these
[1:51:05] five love languages hit next twice um
[1:51:08] the acts of service receiving gifts
[1:51:10] quality time words of affirmation
[1:51:12] physical touch it is I I feel like it's
[1:51:14] so important for you to understand what
[1:51:16] your spouse's love language is and after
[1:51:19] you understand what spouse's love
[1:51:20] language is then you might have to
[1:51:22] understand what your children's love
[1:51:23] language is in order to really establish
[1:51:25] your family I brought you quotes the
[1:51:27] last time I spoke to the fathers amen
[1:51:29] where brother brandham actually used all
[1:51:31] five of these love languages in one
[1:51:34] situation yes sir I proved it I took it
[1:51:37] right through right through the message
[1:51:38] and proved it right so so so these are
[1:51:40] these are things Dr uh Gary Chapman came
[1:51:43] up with these and I find that they're
[1:51:45] very appropriate and and and it's you
[1:51:47] can go out there and read about it
[1:51:48] yourself it's all available to you on
[1:51:50] the internet but these are things that I
[1:51:51] think could be very very beneficial to a
[1:51:53] marriage now you know we're talking
[1:51:54] about wives you know um referencing
[1:51:58] their husbands submitting to their
[1:51:59] husbands now I want to go to something
[1:52:01] here next brother Harold
[1:52:03] Becket has uh put out a little book and
[1:52:07] um and he got all these quotes and
[1:52:09] everything about you know the woman's
[1:52:10] needs and the man's needs and quotes
[1:52:12] about it from from from from every
[1:52:14] position so I I went back to that book
[1:52:16] and I just kind of looked at some of
[1:52:17] these things just hit next for me one
[1:52:19] time these are a woman's needs and you
[1:52:21] know this is what a husband needs to
[1:52:23] understand a woman is looking for a
[1:52:25] leader spiritual guide a protector she's
[1:52:28] looking for affection and tenderness
[1:52:30] amen uh she's also looking for family
[1:52:33] commitment a real good father be be a
[1:52:36] great father be involved in in the
[1:52:38] family amen she looking for a provider
[1:52:41] security through through the finances
[1:52:43] she she wants a husband that will work a
[1:52:46] woman wants that amen uh when a woman
[1:52:48] has a child she most most women want to
[1:52:50] stay home with their child most of them
[1:52:52] want to do that right but they need to
[1:52:54] make sure that the husband can hold
[1:52:55] things down financially another thing is
[1:52:58] that she wants honesty and openness this
[1:53:00] is what a woman is looking for amen now
[1:53:03] let's look at what a man's needs are
[1:53:06] first a man wants a Godly wife with
[1:53:08] inner and outer beauty he wants a Godly
[1:53:11] wife with inner and outer beauty second
[1:53:15] thing a man's looking for she wants he
[1:53:17] wants a woman that don't mind sharing
[1:53:19] his interest
[1:53:21] now now now let me just clarify this she
[1:53:24] don't have to do the interest but if she
[1:53:27] shares them she won't complain about
[1:53:32] him if she shares his interest she won't
[1:53:35] complain about now now you know there's
[1:53:37] some brothers in here that love fishing
[1:53:39] and they be just W their wife to go out
[1:53:40] there fishing but your wife don't like
[1:53:42] touching
[1:53:44] worms your wife don't want to pull off
[1:53:46] no fish she'll eat it now she'll eat it
[1:53:49] but she don't want she don't want to do
[1:53:50] none of that and and you can't get upset
[1:53:52] with her because she don't like touching
[1:53:53] worms right amen you don't like going to
[1:53:57] the
[1:54:03] all is the truth inh I mean I will go
[1:54:08] but I'm looking for a seat soon as I get
[1:54:10] there I'm looking for a
[1:54:13] chair I'm not going to walk from rack to
[1:54:16] rack and

[1:57:11] Godly a man needs a Godly wife with
[1:57:13] inner and outer beauty now um I I'll
[1:57:17] give you if you I'll read this but what
[1:57:20] this story really is about is brother
[1:57:22] brandom telling a story of these two
[1:57:24] couples that he
[1:57:26] married and uh the one couple he married
[1:57:30] he said he had to do all kind of crazy
[1:57:32] stuff the the you know to slide kneel
[1:57:35] down here and do this and do that and
[1:57:37] and get get these kids married it was
[1:57:40] two couples and one one was the both
[1:57:42] daddies were Millionaires and uh you
[1:57:45] know so they had this I mean extravagant
[1:57:47] wedding very EXT extravagant wedding and
[1:57:51] um you know and after he he went there
[1:57:52] and he you know he he he married the
[1:57:54] people then he had this other couple
[1:57:56] that came his brother told him say I
[1:57:58] work with this young man and he want to
[1:58:00] get married he got a young lady that he
[1:58:01] found he wants to get married to her and
[1:58:04] um and he says you know he just he's
[1:58:05] just looking um you know he need a
[1:58:07] preacher to marry him I said my brother
[1:58:08] will marry you so brother Rand said I
[1:58:09] I'll sit down and I'll talk to you and
[1:58:11] I'll I'll uh uh just make sure that that
[1:58:14] that everything is good um you know with
[1:58:17] you and one of the things that he asked
[1:58:18] the young lady because they said it
[1:58:19] didn't look like they was old enough to
[1:58:21] get married he ask young lady said now
[1:58:22] when when when times get
[1:58:26] rough because in every marriage times
[1:58:28] are going to get
[1:58:30] rough anyone that tell you that times
[1:58:33] are not going to get rough they lying to
[1:58:35] you they lying every marriage will have
[1:58:41] disagreements and and and and typically
[1:58:43] you want to have disagreements in your
[1:58:44] court courting stages all right because
[1:58:47] if you're not disagreeing and over over
[1:58:49] coming those disagreements and courting
[1:58:51] then you get married and you say well I
[1:58:52] never thought they was like that you
[1:58:55] didn't Court properly you didn't Court
[1:58:57] properly yet people are going to be
[1:58:59] people y'all two trying to become one
[1:59:02] there should be some disagreements
[1:59:04] that's that's very natural and you you
[1:59:05] got to learn how to work your way
[1:59:07] through that otherwise you're going to
[1:59:09] be working your way through it on the
[1:59:10] other side and I tell people like this
[1:59:12] you're going to pray one way or the
[1:59:13] other either you pray before you get
[1:59:15] married or you're going to pray after
[1:59:16] you married but you're going to pray
[1:59:18] that's right so so so you know this one
[1:59:21] couple I mean he say they didn't have
[1:59:22] nothing he say he say young lady um um
[1:59:26] you know what about when what if he lose
[1:59:28] his job or whatever what you going to do
[1:59:30] you going you still going to stay
[1:59:31] married to him and and it's good that
[1:59:33] the pastor brother brandom in that case
[1:59:35] had questions to ask difficult questions
[1:59:38] you want to see how they respond and how
[1:59:39] they answer them
[1:59:43] amen right as a pastor when I when I'm
[1:59:46] when I'm I'm looking at how the answers
[1:59:49] come coming right and also I'm looking
[1:59:51] at who doing the answer
[1:59:56] yeah I asked him why is she
[2:00:01] answering something is not right here or
[2:00:05] I ask her and he's
[2:00:07] answering you know when when you start
[2:00:09] seeing that you you realize there's a
[2:00:11] spirit here somewhere because they not
[2:00:13] even being truthful one other one
[2:00:14] another somebody's trying to dominate
[2:00:16] the relationship right so I brother
[2:00:19] Brandon asked now what what you going to
[2:00:20] do he you know um you know you going to
[2:00:23] leave him or you know uh he lose his job

[2:04:29] this next one uh giving him preference
[2:04:31] and look at what the brother what the
[2:04:32] prophet says on this in the message here
[2:04:34] you him says the world's looking for
[2:04:35] something today when your little wife

[2:04:51] her arms around him and kind of brush
[2:04:53] his hair back and tell him how much she

[2:04:57] we have a a society where it's not only
[2:05:00] the husband coming home from work but
[2:05:02] the wife is also coming from home from
[2:05:04] work and and when that wife gets home

[2:05:19] economy when you driving home you G have
[2:05:21] to shift your
[2:05:23] gear sir you G have to give your husband
[2:05:26] preference because you know what he's
[2:05:27] the one that's in charge of that house

[2:05:33] work I'm sure he'll do something for you
[2:05:35] if he want to do he'll pay for something
[2:05:36] for you so you can go to get yourself
[2:05:39] one of them them uh neck massages or
[2:05:42] whatever amen he'll pay for it he'll
[2:05:44] give you he he'll give you a um
[2:05:48] certificate to go get one right
[2:05:52] yes I know the husband going to do that
[2:05:55] I know your husband going to go out and
[2:05:57] buy you a gift certificate that's
[2:06:06] right when you promis your husband he
[2:06:08] was looking for somebody when he come in
[2:06:10] tired and weird from working all day
[2:06:12] some little wife to put her arms around
[2:06:13] him and kick and kind of brush his hair
[2:06:15] back and tell him how much she she loved
[2:06:17] him that's what calls is separation in
[2:06:19] families is the neglect of love that's
[2:06:21] what causes separation in churches
[2:06:23] neglect of love we got to have love this
[2:06:27] next one says share his interest now I
[2:06:29] got to be quick I'm being quick in in
[2:06:31] all of this I wish I could just take
[2:06:32] time one of these days I am I'mma come

[2:06:45] honeymoon and and God told him to get
[2:06:47] married October 23rd and he knew God
[2:06:51] knew and brother and brother Randon knew
[2:06:52] October 23rd was the opening of a
[2:06:54] hunting

[2:11:27] husband is known in the gates when she
[2:11:29] sth among the elders when he sth among
[2:11:31] the Elders of the land the character of
[2:11:33] his wife pushes her to a place where
[2:11:35] even a husband is getting praised for
[2:11:38] the wife that he chose right uh another
[2:11:41] thing that I found this on the on the on
[2:11:43] the uh internet this was coming from a
[2:11:45] website radiant marriage and it's a lady
[2:11:47] by the name of Jess uh Ro robart uh now

[2:11:53] this is where I'm going to go into
[2:11:54] overtime so let's let's go next on this
[2:11:56] the first thing is first two things is
[2:11:59] uh admir for admiration and praise
[2:12:01] sister watch what you say about your
[2:12:05] husband Colossians 4:6 says let your
[2:12:07] speech be always with Grace seasoned
[2:12:10] with salt that she may know how you
[2:12:13] ought to answer every man all right and
[2:12:16] this lady said wives need to watch the
[2:12:17] words they say to and about their
[2:12:19] husbands think before you speak our
[2:12:22] words need to edify him and build him up
[2:12:26] the next next one says let him know when
[2:12:27] he has done something
[2:12:30] well you say our husbands need to need
[2:12:32] to hear when they have done something
[2:12:34] well he needs to know that we notice him
[2:12:36] and the steps that he has taken make
[2:12:39] don't make the man feel like he ain't
[2:12:40] contributed nothing to the
[2:12:43] family next thing uh she says is you
[2:12:46] need to learn how to say thank you
[2:12:48] she said these two little words mean so
[2:12:50] much that says I see you and I
[2:12:52] appreciate you am amen also here's a
[2:12:55] good when recognize that your husband is
[2:12:58] not perfect

[2:13:36] him your husband will fail you so many
[2:13:39] so many times you going have to learn
[2:13:40] how to you know he ain't perfect and
[2:13:42] here's here's what what the scripture I
[2:13:44] put with that is 1 Corinthians 13
[2:13:46] charity suffer long right and is kind
[2:13:50] charity enth not all right charity vth
[2:13:53] not itself is not puffed up do not
[2:13:55] behave itself unseemly seeketh not our
[2:13:57] own is not easily provoke and this is
[2:14:00] the one I one I really love in in in in
[2:14:02] in that in in in verse 5 and in 1
[2:14:04] Corinthians 13 thinketh no evil and what
[2:14:07] think of no evil means that you cannot
[2:14:09] keep bringing up the past right if you
[2:14:11] trying to go forward in the future you
[2:14:14] can't keep telling your husband you did
[2:14:15] this 25 years ago you got get past
[2:14:20] that right recognize that he ain't
[2:14:22] perfect amen let's go on to some other
[2:14:25] one watch your verbal your non-verbal
[2:14:28] language it said did you know that
[2:14:30] non-verbal language makes up about 93%
[2:14:32] of our communication our tone of voice
[2:14:35] and body language are huge indicators of
[2:14:37] our respect
[2:14:40] level do you roll your
[2:14:44] eyes do you cross your arms while he
[2:14:47] trying to to talk to you do you look
[2:14:50] away when he's trying to talk with you
[2:14:54] yeah right right if if and you say if
[2:14:58] you say yeah I do that then watch your
[2:15:01] nonverbal
[2:15:03] language you're going to have to fix
[2:15:05] some of
[2:15:07] that would you do that to
[2:15:10] [Music]
[2:15:14] Jesus act like Jesus is in your husband
[2:15:17] cuz he is amen
[2:15:20] am watch your non-verbal
[2:15:23] language this admiration and praise
[2:15:25] another one is seek to
[2:15:28] understand and what this is is don't
[2:15:30] assume the worst all the time assume the
[2:15:32] best and seek to understand your
[2:15:33] husband's heart rather than seeking to
[2:15:36] be understood we need to truly hear
[2:15:38] where our spouse is coming from is often
[2:15:41] a much better spot than we
[2:15:43] think be
[2:15:46] trustworthy what this me and and and and
[2:15:48] this lady said with while this needs to
[2:15:50] be in all areas I specifically want to
[2:15:53] talk about finances there have been many
[2:15:56] wives that have talked that have talked
[2:15:58] that I have talked to Who hide purchases
[2:16:01] and packages from their
[2:16:11] husbands they want to get home before he
[2:16:13] get
[2:16:15] home because there's a package coming I
[2:16:17] don't need him see that it's not his
[2:16:19] gift it's something you bought and and
[2:16:22] it's not something that you bought it's
[2:16:23] something you keep
[2:16:25] buying these packages show up every day
[2:16:28] every
[2:16:29] day and you hiding
[2:16:32] them credit card just running up like
[2:16:34] crazy and then you get yourself so maxed
[2:16:37] out now you looking for him to try to
[2:16:38] give you a little money to try to get
[2:16:40] off that get get get get that credit
[2:16:41] card back under control who who who who
[2:16:44] did it you did it
[2:16:48] you going to have to learn how to
[2:16:49] control yourself over them little
[2:16:52] packages Amazon become a
[2:16:57] curse you know most people you know the
[2:16:59] Amazon is actually a
[2:17:01] place it's a it's a place a Amazon
[2:17:04] forest and most people will not walk
[2:17:06] through that
[2:17:09] Forest but they'll take their
[2:17:12] Mouse and they'll go right through the
[2:17:14] force of Amazon on on the
[2:17:16] internet
[2:17:20] be
[2:17:29] trustworthy pray for your
[2:17:31] husband
[2:17:33] defitely pray for his heart yes for his
[2:17:37] mind pray that God will protect him and
[2:17:39] cultivate a man who loves the Lord and
[2:17:41] is obedient right and here's the thing
[2:17:44] that I want you to understand this what
[2:17:45] this lady wrote anything anything that
[2:17:47] to help the human race is Godly this
[2:17:50] lady said God is the only one who can
[2:17:51] transform our hearts and we need to
[2:17:53] trust that God is in control praying for
[2:17:56] our husband recognizes that we are not
[2:17:59] in the driver's seat God
[2:18:01] is amen amen the last one she says is
[2:18:05] have a Gentle Spirit true she says cloak
[2:18:09] yourself with gentleness Grace and
[2:18:11] humility this is what will speak to your
[2:18:14] husband's heart and and I like this cuz
[2:18:15] first Peter uh chap 3: 1-6 says likewise
[2:18:19] your wives be in subjection to your own
[2:18:21] husbands that if any obey not the word
[2:18:23] they also May without the word be won by
[2:18:25] the conversation of the wives while the
[2:18:28] while they behold your Chase
[2:18:30] conversation coupled with fear whose
[2:18:32] adorning let it not be that outward
[2:18:34] adornment of platting the hair and of
[2:18:35] wearing of gold or of putting on of
[2:18:38] apparel but let it be the hidden man of
[2:18:40] the heart and that which is not
[2:18:41] corruptible even the ornament of a meek
[2:18:43] and quiet Spirit a meek and quiet Spirit
[2:18:47] which is is in the sight of God of great
[2:18:49] price amen that means it's it's kind of
[2:18:51] hard for people for sisters to get
[2:18:53] themselves to that spot where they have
[2:18:55] a Meek and quiet spirit amen for after
[2:18:57] this manner in Old Time the holy women
[2:19:00] also who trusted in God adorned
[2:19:02] themselves being in subjection unto
[2:19:05] their own husband even as Sarah obeyed
[2:19:08] Abraham calling him
[2:19:11] Lord whose daughters ye are as long as
[2:19:15] you do well and not afraid with any
[2:19:18] amazement I like that Sarah call Abraham
[2:19:20] Lord and I love the way brother Keith
[2:19:21] Brown says you know either you're going
[2:19:23] to call your husband my Lord man you
[2:19:26] just blessed me I just thank God for
[2:19:30] you so GL so glad God gave you to me or
[2:19:34] you going to say my
[2:19:38] [Applause]
[2:19:40] Lord which one you think going to be
[2:19:42] encouraging in your
[2:19:46] house
[2:19:49] this last one that I want to give you
[2:19:50] your husband need
[2:19:56] forgiveness here brother brandom says in
[2:19:58] this message why other people so talks
[2:19:59] about he's giving a woman advice their
[2:20:02] house is about to fall apart they're
[2:20:03] breaking up they're they're they're
[2:20:05] leaving and he gives his wife some
[2:20:07] advice now when he gives his wife advice
[2:20:08] he's actually giving her advice of some
[2:20:11] of the love languages that she could
[2:20:14] use one of them is physical touch uh and
[2:20:17] the other one is words of affirmation
[2:20:18] which is praise right it says the most
[2:20:21] powerful weapon there is in the world is
[2:20:23] love I stood by a little lady the other
[2:20:24] night where her husband was fixing to
[2:20:26] leave her and marry another woman a very
[2:20:29] fine known couple I looked at her she
[2:20:32] said well I'm going to leave brother
[2:20:34] brandom I said don't do it sister told
[2:20:37] me said oh my husband his ministry will
[2:20:38] be ruined what can I do I'm going to New
[2:20:41] York and I'm going to get me a job I
[2:20:43] said don't do it don't do it sister what
[2:20:47] can I do brother brandom I said go up to
[2:20:49] him said well I found the lady's picture
[2:20:52] and I broke it up and I done so and so
[2:20:53] and I did that I see that but I said go
[2:20:56] up to him put your arms around him and
[2:20:57] say
[2:20:58] sweetheart no matter what you done I
[2:21:02] still love you that'll do it it was
[2:21:05] right when this woman was really willing
[2:21:07] to forgive her
[2:21:09] husband go up and show him physical
[2:21:12] touch and and and now I I can almost say
[2:21:14] probably in this household there was not
[2:21:15] a lot of physical touch oh oh my but but
[2:21:19] she probably didn't realize this was her
[2:21:20] husband's love language that he needed
[2:21:22] her to come and put her arms around him
[2:21:24] and and just and just reaffirm him that
[2:21:26] I'm with you no matter what you've done
[2:21:28] I still love you and and notice now
[2:21:30] notice this because in the scripture you
[2:21:32] know uh I I I've seen sisters get
[2:21:34] divorced they divorce their husbands
[2:21:36] over a scripture that they misinterpret
[2:21:38] a scripture says that if if if a wife
[2:21:40] does something like this then a husband
[2:21:42] has a right right Matthew speaks about
[2:21:44] it if a wife does something then a
[2:21:45] husband has a right and they say the
[2:21:47] wife wife does it husband has a right
[2:21:48] well if the husband do it I have a right
[2:21:50] but that ain't what the Bible say ain't
[2:21:53] what the Bible say and and and in all
[2:21:55] honesty I don't know one scripture that
[2:21:57] supports a wife just leaving her husband
[2:21:59] now if they separate that's one thing
[2:22:01] but the Bible say you try to reconcile
[2:22:03] even in separation that's what the Bible
[2:22:05] say you can't stop you can't stop that
[2:22:07] but here the thing of it is is that you
[2:22:09] it's not it's not supportive of a wife
[2:22:11] just getting up and well he this and he
[2:22:12] that wait a minute now let's get back to
[2:22:15] Bible order right let's get back to
[2:22:17] Bible order amen amen amen right but
[2:22:22] here you know this this love language of
[2:22:24] going and just putting her arms around
[2:22:26] her husband and then with with words of
[2:22:28] affirmation say no matter what You' done
[2:22:30] I still love you that's what actually
[2:22:32] restored their home and that's what kept
[2:22:34] that other lady out their
[2:22:39] house husband needs
[2:22:42] forgiveness the wife also needs
[2:22:44] forgiveness we all need that amen next
[2:22:47] next I think uh here let me these are my
[2:22:50] last two quotes go next
[2:22:54] again so let's go back to the beginning
[2:22:57] in the original physical creation as we
[2:22:58] know it today God made everything in
[2:23:01] pairs male and female there were two
[2:23:02] chickens rooster and hen there were two
[2:23:04] cattle the cow and the bull and right
[2:23:07] down the line but when it came to man
[2:23:08] there was only one there were not a pair
[2:23:11] Adam had been made in the image of God
[2:23:13] he was a Son of God as a Son of God he
[2:23:15] could not be tempted and fall
[2:23:17] that would be impossible so God took a
[2:23:19] byproduct of a man to cause the fall now
[2:23:22] and I like the way another brother say
[2:23:24] uh if if if if if God um the woman is
[2:23:28] the byproduct of the man she was the rib
[2:23:29] out of the man she was the byproduct of
[2:23:32] a man amen she was a byproduct of a man
[2:23:36] Brothers you need to understand why your
[2:23:38] wives like to
[2:23:46] byproducts
[2:23:53] can I can I can I say it this way that
[2:23:55] used to be in you
[2:23:57] brother God took it out of you and gave
[2:23:59] it to your
[2:24:00] wife all right let's
[2:24:03] finish
[2:24:05] um there were two cattle to C the bull
[2:24:07] and right down the line but when it came
[2:24:09] to man there was only one there were not
[2:24:10] a pair Adam been made an image of God he
[2:24:12] was the son of God as a Son of God he
[2:24:14] could not be tempted and fall they would
[2:24:15] be that would be impossible so God took
[2:24:16] a by product of a man that caus a fall
[2:24:19] one woman never Ste fresh from the hand
[2:24:20] of God as a true product of God she was
[2:24:23] produced from man when God cused her to
[2:24:26] be brought forth from man she was vastly
[2:24:28] different from the from the other
[2:24:29] females he had created she was able to
[2:24:32] be seduced no other female in creation
[2:24:35] can be immoral but the human female may
[2:24:37] be touched at almost any time and that
[2:24:40] weakness in her allowed Satan to to to
[2:24:43] seduce her by the weight of the serpent
[2:24:45] and he and has brought the woman come
[2:24:47] into a very peculiar position before God
[2:24:50] and His word the next statement says
[2:24:53] she's the type of all things vulgar foul
[2:24:56] and loome on the one hand and on the
[2:24:59] other hand she is the type of all things
[2:25:01] clean and beautiful and holy as the
[2:25:04] receptacle of the spirit and the
[2:25:05] blessing of God blessings of God on the
[2:25:07] one hand she is called the who is
[2:25:09] drunk with the wine of her fornications
[2:25:12] on the other hand she is called the
[2:25:13] bride of Christ on one hand she is
[2:25:15] called mystery Babylon the Abomination
[2:25:17] before God and on the other hand she is
[2:25:20] called New Jerusalem our mother on the
[2:25:23] one hand she is so foul and wicked and
[2:25:25] LW that she is summarily cast into the
[2:25:27] Lake of Fire as the only fit place for
[2:25:30] her and on the other hand she's exalted
[2:25:33] to Heaven sharing the very Throne of God
[2:25:36] as the only face only place
[2:25:40] befitting such a
[2:25:42] queen our objective our goal
[2:25:47] just hit next on that our objective our
[2:25:49] goal our reason for even bringing this
[2:25:52] is that we want to find
[2:25:53] ourselves in this structure that God has
[2:25:57] established for the family Christ is our
[2:26:00] head the husband amen is underneath
[2:26:02] Christ the wife underneath the husband
[2:26:05] and the children underneath that this is
[2:26:07] the way God establish it I know Society
[2:26:09] does something totally different but
[2:26:11] we're Christians and we want to do it
[2:26:13] the way God established it God richly
[2:26:16] blessed your
[2:26:20] church
[2:26:22] amen let us pray father we thank you for
[2:26:26] your word
[2:26:28] today thank you for the opportunity we
[2:26:30] have Lord to just revisit and look at
[2:26:33] these things that you have placed in the
[2:26:36] scripture all the way back in Genesis
[2:26:38] Lord you started amen a
[2:26:41] process you gave us a structure and Lord
[2:26:45] uh it's all we need need to do father is
[2:26:47] just follow the structure that you have
[2:26:49] you've put in place help us God to
[2:26:51] receive the word we don't want to be out
[2:26:54] of a position we want to receive all the
[2:26:57] blessings that you have for us oh God
[2:26:58] and we realize that uh if we're not
[2:27:01] doing things according to your perfect
[2:27:02] will then there's no way that we'd be
[2:27:04] able to uh get those blessings you
[2:27:06] started us off off this year with a
[2:27:09] theme that theme was to to to submit to
[2:27:13] the perfect will of God and Father even
[2:27:16] all down here to September Lord you are
[2:27:19] bringing us to this point father amen
[2:27:22] where uh we're still finding a a place
[2:27:24] where we could submit first the
[2:27:27] scripture tells us to submit ourselves
[2:27:28] one to another secondly it tells the
[2:27:31] wise to submit themselves to the
[2:27:33] husbands and then thirdly Lord the
[2:27:35] husbands have to love their wives the
[2:27:37] way Christ love the church because this
[2:27:39] is a great mystery that Paul is speaking
[2:27:41] of Lord is the mystery of Christ in the
[2:27:44] church and our marriages that reflect
[2:27:46] the relationship that you have with your
[2:27:49] church God we pray that the words Lord
[2:27:52] would not just go in one ear and out the
[2:27:54] other but Lord may it register in our in
[2:27:56] the depths of our soul that we'll find
[2:27:57] ourselves living amen according to word
[2:28:00] there there might be saints that uh have
[2:28:02] been married Lord and going through
[2:28:04] different things but father they'll have
[2:28:05] to give advice to others Lord that'll
[2:28:08] come along the way I pray father they
[2:28:09] give them the word give them the word
[2:28:11] God we can only stand on the word we
[2:28:14] give you all the glory we give you all
[2:28:16] the praise give you all the honors in
[2:28:17] Jesus name we pray amen and amen God
[2:28:21] bless you church I'll turn the service
[2:28:23] back over to brother Solomon at this
[2:28:24] time God bless you
[2:28:26] [Music]

[2:28:39] Lord amen how many appreciate the
[2:28:43] pastor

[2:29:07] times I would come home just angry
